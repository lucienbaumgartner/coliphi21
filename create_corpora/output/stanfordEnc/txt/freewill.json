Questions concerning the\nnature and existence of this kind of control (e.g., does it require\nand do we have the freedom to do otherwise or the power of\nself-determination?), and what its true significance is (is it\nnecessary for moral responsibility or human dignity?) have been taken\nup in every period of Western philosophy and by many of the most\nimportant philosophical figures, such as Plato, Aristotle, Augustine,\nAquinas, Descartes, and Kant. (We cannot undertake here a review of\nrelated discussions in other philosophical traditions. For a start,\nthe reader may consult Marchal and Wenzel 2017 and Chakrabarti 2017\nfor overviews of thought on free will, broadly construed, in Chinese\nand Indian philosophical traditions, respectively.) In this way, it\nshould be clear that disputes about free will ineluctably involve\ndisputes about metaphysics and ethics. In ferreting out the kind of\ncontrol involved in free will, we are forced to consider questions\nabout (among others) causation, laws of nature, time, substance,\nontological reduction vs emergence, the relationship of causal and\nreasons-based explanations, the nature of motivation and more\ngenerally of human persons. In assessing the significance of free\nwill, we are forced to consider questions about (among others)\nrightness and wrongness, good and evil, virtue and vice, blame and\npraise, reward and punishment, and desert. The topic of free will also\ngives rise to purely empirical questions that are beginning to be\nexplored in the human sciences: do we have it, and to what degree?\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is an overview of what follows. In Section 1, we\nacquaint the reader with some central historical contributions to our\nunderstanding of free will. (As nearly every major and minor figure\nhad something to say about it, we cannot begin to cover them all.) As\nwith contributions to many other foundational topics, these ideas are\nnot of ‘merely historical interest’: present-day\nphilosophers continue to find themselves drawn back to certain\nthinkers as they freshly engage their contemporaries. In Section\n2, we map the complex architecture of the contemporary discussion\nof the nature of free will by dividing it into five subtopics: its\nrelation to moral responsibility; the proper analysis of the freedom\nto do otherwise; a powerful, recent argument that the freedom to do\notherwise (at least in one important sense) is not necessary\nfor moral responsibility; ‘compatibilist’ accounts of\nsourcehood or self-determination; and ‘incompatibilist’ or\n‘libertarian’ accounts of source and\nself-determination. In Section 3, we consider arguments from\nexperience, a priori reflection, and various scientific findings and\ntheories for and against the thesis that human beings have free will,\nalong with the related question of whether it is reasonable to believe\nthat we have it. Finally, in Section 4, we survey the\nlong-debated questions involving free will that arise in classical\ntheistic metaphysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne finds scholarly debate on the ‘origin’ of the notion\nof free will in Western philosophy. (See, e.g., Dihle (1982) and, in\nresponse Frede (2011), with Dihle finding it in St. Augustine\n(354–430 CE) and Frede in the Stoic Epictetus\n(c. 55–c. 135 CE)). But this debate presupposes a fairly\nparticular and highly conceptualized concept of free will, with\nDihle’s later ‘origin’ reflecting his having a yet\nmore particular concept in view than Frede. If, instead, we look more\ngenerally for philosophical reflection on choice-directed control over\none’s own actions, then we find significant discussion in Plato\nand Aristotle (cf. Irwin 1992). Indeed, on this matter, as with so\nmany other major philosophical issues, Plato and Aristotle give\nimportantly different emphases that inform much subsequent\nthought. \n\nIn Book IV of The Republic, Plato posits rational, spirited,\nand appetitive aspects to the human soul. The wise person strives for\ninner ‘justice’, a condition in which each part of the\nsoul plays its proper role—reason as the guide, the spirited\nnature as the ally of reason, exhorting oneself to do what reason\ndeems proper, and the passions as subjugated to the determinations of\nreason. In the absence of justice, the individual is enslaved to the\npassions. Hence, freedom for Plato is a kind of self-mastery, attained\nby developing the virtues of wisdom, courage, and temperance,\nresulting in one’s liberation from the tyranny of base desires\nand acquisition of a more accurate understanding and resolute pursuit\nof the Good. \n\nWhile Aristotle shares with Plato a concern for cultivating virtues,\nhe gives greater theoretical attention to the role of choice in\ninitiating individual actions which, over time, result in habits, for\ngood or ill. In Book III of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle\nsays that, unlike nonrational agents, we have the power to do or not\nto do, and much of what we do is voluntary, such that its origin is\n‘in us’ and we are ‘aware of the particular\ncircumstances of the action’. Furthermore, mature humans make\nchoices after deliberating about different available means to our\nends, drawing on rational principles of action. Choose consistently\nwell (poorly), and a virtuous (vicious) character will form over time,\nand it is in our power to be either virtuous or vicious. \n\nA question that Aristotle seems to recognize, while not satisfactorily\nanswering, is whether the choice an individual makes on any given\noccasion is wholly determined by his internal state—perception\nof his circumstances and his relevant beliefs, desires, and general\ncharacter dispositions (wherever on the continuum between virtue and\nvice he may be)—and external circumstances. He says that\n“the man is the father of his actions as of\nchildren”—that is, a person’s character shapes how\nshe acts. One might worry that this seems to entail that the person\ncould not have done otherwise—at the moment of choice, she has\nno control over what her present character is—and so she is not\nresponsible for choosing as she does. Aristotle responds by contending\nthat her present character is partly a result of previous\nchoices she made. While this claim is plausible enough, it seems to\n‘pass the buck’, since ‘the man is the father’\nof those earlier choices and actions, too. \n\nWe note just a few contributions of the subsequent centuries of the\nHellenistic era. This period was dominated by debates between\nEpicureans, Stoics, and the Academic Skeptics, and as it concerned\nfreedom of the will, the debate centered on the place of determinism\nor of fate in governing human actions and lives. The Stoics and the\nEpicureans believed that all ordinary things, human souls included,\nare corporeal and governed by natural laws or principles. Stoics\nbelieved that all human choice and behavior was causally determined,\nbut held that this was compatible with our actions being ‘up to\nus’.  Chrysippus ably defended this position by contending that\nyour actions are ‘up to you’ when they come about\n‘through you’—when the determining factors of your\naction are not external circumstances compelling you to act as you do\nbut are instead your own choices grounded in your perception of the\noptions before you.  Hence, for moral responsibility, the issue is not\nwhether one’s choices are determined (they are) but in what\nmanner they are determined. Epicurus and his followers had a more\nmechanistic conception of bodily action than the Stoics. They held\nthat all things (human soul included) are constituted by atoms, whose\nlaw-governed behavior fixes the behavior of everything made of such\natoms. But they rejected determinism by supposing that atoms, though\nlaw-governed, are susceptible to slight ‘swerves’ or\ndepartures from the usual paths. Epicurus has often been understood as\nseeking to ground the freedom of human willings in such\nindeterministic swerves, but this is a matter of controversy. If this\nunderstanding of his aim is correct, how he thought that this scheme\nmight work in detail is not known. (What little we know about his\nviews in this matter stem chiefly from the account given in his\nfollower Lucretius’s six-book poem,\nOn the Nature of Things.) \n\nA final notable figure of this period was Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nthe most important Peripatetic commentator on Aristotle. In his On\nFate, Alexander sharply criticizes the positions of the\nStoics. He goes on to resolve the ambiguity in Aristotle on the\nquestion of the determining nature of character on individual choices\nby maintaining that, given all such shaping factors, it remains open\nto the person when she acts freely to do or not to do what she in fact\ndoes. Many scholars see Alexander as the first unambiguously\n‘libertarian’ theorist of the will (for more information\nabout such theories see section 2 below). \n\nAugustine (354–430) is the central bridge between the ancient\nand medieval eras of philosophy. His mature thinking about the will\nwas influenced by his early encounter with late classical Neoplatonist\nthought, which is then transformed by the theological views he\nembraces in his adult Christian conversion, famously recounted in his\nConfessions. In that work and in the earlier On the Free\nChoice of the Will, Augustine struggles to draw together into a\ncoherent whole the doctrines that creaturely misuse of freedom, not\nGod, is the source of evil in the world and that the human will has\nbeen corrupted through the ‘fall’ from grace of the\nearliest human beings, necessitating a salvation that is attained\nentirely through the actions of God, even as it requires,\nconstitutively, an individual’s willed response of faith. The\ndetails of Augustine’s positive account remain a matter of\ncontroversy. He clearly affirms that the will is by its nature a\nself-determining power—no powers external to it determine its\nchoice—and that this feature is the basis of its freedom. But he\ndoes not explicitly rule out the will’s being internally\ndetermined by psychological factors, as Chrysippus held, and Augustine\nhad theological reasons that might favor (as well as others that would\noppose) the thesis that all things are determined in some manner by\nGod. Scholars divide on whether Augustine was a libertarian or instead\na kind of compatibilist with respect to metaphysical freedom. It is\nclear, however, that Augustine thought that we are powerfully shaped\nby wrongly-ordered desires that can make it impossible for us to\nwholeheartedly will ends contrary to those desires, for a\nsustained period of time. This condition entails an absence of\nsomething more valuable, ‘true freedom’, in which our wills\nare aligned with the Good, a freedom that can be attained only by a\ntransformative operation of divine grace. This latter, psychological\nconception of freedom of will clearly echoes Plato’s notion of\nthe soul’s (possible) inner justice. \n\nThomas Aquinas (1225–1274) attempted to synthesize major strands\nof Aristotle’s systematic philosophy with Christian theology,\nand so Aquinas begins his complex discussion of human action and\nchoice by agreeing with Aristotle that creatures such as ourselves who\nare endowed with both intellect and will are hardwired to will certain\ngeneral ends ordered to the most general goal of goodness. Will is\nrational desire: we cannot move towards that which does not\nappear to us at the time to be good. Freedom enters the picture when\nwe consider various means to these ends and move ourselves to activity\nin pursuit of certain of them. Our will is free in that it is not\nfixed by nature on any particular means, and they generally do not\nappear to us either as unqualifiedly good or as uniquely satisfying\nthe end we wish to fulfill. Furthermore, what appears to us to be good\ncan vary widely—even, over time, intra-personally. So much is\nconsistent with saying that in a given total circumstance (including\none’s present beliefs and desires), one is necessitated to will\nas one does.  For this reason, some commentators have taken Aquinas to\nbe a kind of compatibilist concerning freedom and causal or\ntheological determinism.  In his most extended defense of the thesis\nthat the will is not ‘compelled’ (DM 6), Aquinas\nnotes three ways that the will might reject an option it sees as\nattractive: (i) it finds another option more attractive, (ii) it comes\nto think of some circumstance rendering an alternative more favorable\n“by some chance circumstance, external or internal”, and\n(iii) the person is momentarily disposed to find an alternative\nattractive by virtue of a non-innate state that is subject to the will\n(e.g., being angry vs being at peace). The first consideration is\nclearly consistent with compatibilism. The second at best points to a\nkind of contingency that is not grounded in the activity of the will\nitself. And one wanting to read Aquinas as a libertarian might worry\nthat his third consideration just passes the buck: even if we do\nsometimes have an ability to directly modify perception-coloring\nstates such as moods, Aquinas’s account of will as rational\ndesire seems to indicate that we will do so only if it seems\nto us on balance to be good to do so. Those who read Aquinas as a\nlibertarian point to the following further remark in this text:\n“Will itself can interfere with the process [of some\ncause’s moving the will] either by refusing to consider what\nattracts it to will or by considering its opposite: namely, that there\nis a bad side to what is being proposed…” (Reply to 15;\nsee also DV 24.2). For discussion, see MacDonald (1998); and for\nthorough discussion of Aquinas’s theory of action, see Donagan\n(1985) and Stump (2003, ch. 9). \n\nJohn Duns Scotus (1265/66–1308) was the stoutest defender in the\nmedieval era of a strongly libertarian conception of the will,\nmaintaining on introspective grounds that will by its very nature is\nsuch that “nothing other than the will is the total cause”\nof its activity (QAM). Indeed, he held the unusual view that\nnot only up to but at the very instant that one is willing\n\\(X\\), it is possible for one to will \\(Y\\) or at least not to will\n\\(X\\). (He articulates this view through the puzzling claim that a\nsingle instant of time comprises two ‘instants of nature’,\nat the first but not the second of which alternative possibilities are\npreserved.) In opposition to Aquinas and other medieval Aristotelians,\nScotus maintained that a precondition of our freedom is that there are\ntwo fundamentally distinct ways things can seem good to us: as\npractically advantageous to us or as according with justice. Contrary\nto some popular accounts, however, Scotus allowed that the scope of\navailable alternatives for a person will be more or less\nconstricted. He grants that we are not capable of willing something in\nwhich we see no good whatsoever, nor of positively repudiating\nsomething which appears to us as unqualifiedly good. However, in\naccordance with his uncompromising position that nothing can be the\ntotal cause of the will other than itself, he held that where\nsomething does appear to us as unqualifiedly good (perfectly suited\nboth to our advantage and justice)—viz., in the ‘beatific\nvision’ of God in the afterlife—we still can refrain\nfrom willing it. \n\nThe problem of free will was an important topic in the modern period,\nwith all the major figures wading into it (Descartes 1641 [1988], 1644\n[1988]; Hobbes 1654 [1999], 1656 [1999]; Spinoza 1677 [1992]; Leibniz\n1686 [1991]; Locke 1690 [1975]; Hume 1740 [1978], 1748 [1975]; Edwards\n1754 [1957]; Kant 1781 [1998], 1785 [1998], 1788 [2015]; Reid 1788\n[1969]), and it continued to be widely discussed among early twentieth\ncentury philosophers (Moore 1912; Hobart 1934; Schlick 1939;\nNowell-Smith 1948, 1954; Campbell 1951; Ayer 1954; Smart 1961). The\ncentrality of the problem of free will to the various projects of\nearly modern philosophers can be traced to two widely, though not\nuniversally, shared assumptions. The first is that without belief in\nfree will, there would be little reason for us to act morally. More\ncarefully, it was widely assumed that belief in an afterlife in which\na just God rewards and punishes us according to our right or wrong use\nof free will was key to motivating us to be moral (Russell 2008,\nchs. 16–17). Life before death affords us many examples in which\nvice is better rewarded than virtue and so without knowledge of a\nfinal judgment in the afterlife, we would have little reason to pursue\nvirtue and justice when they depart from self-interest. And without\nfree will there can be no final judgement. \n\nThe second widely shared assumption is that free will seems difficult\nto reconcile with what we know about the world. While this assumption\nis shared by the majority of early modern philosophers, what\nspecifically it is about the world that seems to conflict with freedom\ndiffers from philosopher to philosopher. For some, the worry is\nprimarily theological. How can we make sense of contingency and\nfreedom in a world determined by a God who must choose the best\npossible world to create? For some, the worry was primarily\nmetaphysical. The principle of sufficient reason—roughly, the\nidea that every event must have a reason or cause—was a\ncornerstone of Descartes’s, Leibniz’s, and Spinoza’s\nmetaphysics. How does contingency and freedom fit into such a world?\nFor some, the worry was primarily scientific. Given that a proper\nunderstanding of the physical world is one in which all physical\nobjects are governed by deterministic laws of nature, how does\ncontingency and freedom fit into such a world? Of course, for some,\nall three worries were in play in their work (this is true especially\nof Descartes and Leibniz). \n\nDespite many disagreements about how best to solve these worries,\nthere were three claims that were widely, although not universally,\nagreed upon. The first was that free will has two aspects: the freedom\nto do otherwise and the power of self-determination. The second is\nthat an adequate account of free will must entail that free agents are\nmorally responsible agents and/or fit subjects for punishment. Ideas\nabout moral responsibility were often a yard stick by which analyses\nof free will were measured, with critics objecting to an analysis of\nfree will by arguing that agents who satisfied the analysis would not,\nintuitively, be morally responsible for their actions. The third is\nthat compatibilism—the thesis that free will is compatible with\ndeterminism—is true. (Spinoza, Reid, and Kant are the clear\nexceptions to this, though some also see Descartes as an\nincompatibilist [Ragland 2006].) \n\nSince a detailed discussion of these philosophers’ accounts of\nfree will would take us too far afield, we want instead to focus on\nisolating a two-step strategy for defending compatibilism that emerges\nin the early modern period and continued to exert considerable force\ninto the early twentieth century (and perhaps is still at work today).\nAdvocates of this two-step strategy have come to be known as\n“classical compatibilists”. The first step was to argue\nthat the contrary of freedom is not determinism but external\nconstraint on doing what one wants to do. For example, Hobbes contends\nthat liberty is “the absence of all the impediments to action\nthat are not contained in the nature and intrinsical quality of the\nagent” (Hobbes 1654 [1999], 38; cf. Hume 1748 [1975] VIII.1;\nEdwards 1754 [1957]; Ayer 1954). This idea led many compatibilists,\nespecially the more empiricist-inclined, to develop desire- or\npreference-based analyses of both the freedom to do otherwise and\nself-determination. An agent has the freedom to do otherwise than\n\\(\\phi\\) just in case if she\npreferred or willed to do otherwise, she would have\ndone otherwise (Hobbes 1654 [1999], 16; Locke 1690 [1975]) II.xx.8;\nHume 1748 [1975] VIII.1; Moore 1912; Ayer 1954). The freedom to do\notherwise does not require that you are able to act contrary to your\nstrongest motivation but simply that your action be dependent on your\nstrongest motivation in the sense that had you desired\nsomething else more strongly, then you would have pursued that\nalternative end. (We will discuss this analysis in more detail below in\nsection 2.2.) Similarly, an agent self-determines her \\(\\phi\\)-ing just in\ncase \\(\\phi\\) is caused by her strongest desires or\npreferences at the time of action (Hobbes 1654 [1999]; Locke\n1690 [1975]; Edwards 1754 [1957]). (We will discuss this analysis in\nmore detail below in section 2.4.) Given these analyses, determinism\nseems innocuous to freedom. \n\nThe second step was to argue that any attempt to analyze free will in\na way that putatively captures a deeper or more robust sense of\nfreedom leads to intractable conundrums. The most important examples\nof this attempt to capture a deeper sense of freedom in the modern\nperiod are Immanuel Kant (1781 [1998], 1785 [1998], 1788 [2015]) and\nThomas Reid (1788 [1969]) and in the early twentieth century\nC. A. Campbell (1951). These philosophers argued that the above\ncompatibilist analyses of the freedom to do otherwise and\nself-determination are, at best, insufficient for free will, and, at\nworst, incompatible with it. With respect to the classical\ncompatibilist analysis of the freedom to do otherwise, these critics\nargued that the freedom to do otherwise requires not just that an\nagent could have acted differently if he had willed\ndifferently, but also that he could have\nwilled differently. Free will requires more than free action.\nWith respect to classical compatibilists’ analysis of\nself-determination, they argued that self-determination requires that\nthe agent—rather than his desires, preferences, or any other\nmental state—cause his free choices and actions. Reid\nexplains: \n\nI consider the determination of the will as an effect. This effect\nmust have a cause which had the power to produce it; and the cause\nmust be either the person himself, whose will it is, or some other\nbeing…. If the person was the cause of that determination of\nhis own will, he was free in that action, and it is justly imputed to\nhim, whether it be good or bad. But, if another being was the cause of\nthis determination, either producing it immediately, or by means and\ninstruments under his direction, then the determination is the act and\ndeed of that being, and is solely imputed to him. (1788 [1969] IV.i,\n265) \n\nClassical compatibilists argued that both claims are incoherent.\nWhile it is intelligible to ask whether a man willed to do what he\ndid, it is incoherent to ask whether a man willed to will what he\ndid: \n\nFor to ask whether a man is at liberty to will either motion or rest,\nspeaking or silence, which he pleases, is to ask whether a man\ncan will what he wills, or be pleased with what he\nis pleased with? A question which, I think, needs no answer; and they\nwho make a question of it must suppose one will to determine the acts\nof another, and another to determine that, and so on in\ninfinitum. (Locke 1690 [1975] II.xx.25; cf. Hobbes 1656 [1999],\n72) \n\nIn response to libertarians’ claim that self-determination\nrequires that the agent, rather than his motives, cause his actions,\nit was objected that this removes the agent from the natural causal\norder, which is clearly unintelligible for human animals (Hobbes 1654\n[1999], 38). It is important to recognize that an implication of the\nsecond step of the strategy is that free will is not only compatible\nwith determinism but actually requires determinism (cf. Hume 1748\n[1975] VIII). This was a widely shared assumption among compatibilists\nup through the mid-twentieth century. \n\nSpinoza’s Ethics (1677 [1992]) is an important\ndeparture from the above dialectic. He endorses a strong form of\nnecessitarianism in which everything is categorically necessary\nopposed to the weaker form of conditional necessity embraced by most\ncompatibilists, and he contends that there is no room in such a world\nfor divine or creaturely free will. Thus, Spinoza is a free will\nskeptic. Interestingly, Spinoza is also keen to deny that the\nnonexistence of free will has the dire implications often assumed. As\nnoted above, many in the modern period saw belief in free will and an\nafterlife in which God rewards the just and punishes the wicked as\nnecessary to motivate us to act morally. According to Spinoza, so far\nfrom this being necessary to motivate us to be moral, it actually\ndistorts our pursuit of morality. True moral living, Spinoza thinks,\nsees virtue as its own reward (Part V, Prop. 42). Moreover, while free\nwill is a chimera, humans are still capable of freedom or\nself-determination. Such self-determination, which admits of degrees\non Spinoza’s view, arises when our emotions are determined by\ntrue ideas about the nature of reality. The emotional lives of the\nfree persons are ones in which “we desire nothing but that which\nmust be, nor, in an absolute sense, can we find contentment in\nanything but truth. And so in so far as we rightly understand these\nmatters, the endeavor of the better part of us is in harmony with the\norder of the whole of Nature” (Part IV, Appendix). Spinoza is an\nimportant forerunner to the many free will skeptics in the twentieth\ncentury, a position that continues to attract strong support (see\nStrawson 1986; Double 1992; Smilansky 2000; Pereboom 2001, 2014; Levy\n2011; Waller 2011; Caruso 2012; Vilhauer 2012. For further discussion\n see the entry\n skepticism about moral responsibility).  \n\nIt is worth observing that in many of these disputes about the nature\nof free will there is an underlying dispute about the nature of moral\nresponsibility. This is seen clearly in Hobbes (1654 [1999]) and early\ntwentieth century philosophers’ defense of compatibilism.\nUnderlying the belief that free will is incompatible with determinism\nis the thought that no one would be morally responsible for any\nactions in a deterministic world in the sense that no one would\ndeserve blame or punishment. Hobbes responded to this charge\nin part by endorsing broadly consequentialist justifications of blame and\npunishment: we are justified in blaming or punishing because these\npractices deter future harmful actions and/or contribute to reforming\nthe offender (1654 [1999], 24–25; cf. Schlick 1939; Nowell-Smith\n1948; Smart 1961). While many, perhaps even most, compatibilists have\ncome to reject this consequentialist approach to moral responsibility\nin the wake of P. F. Strawson’s 1962 landmark essay\n‘Freedom and Resentment’ (though see Vargas (2013) and\nMcGeer (2014) for contemporary defenses of compatibilism that appeal\nto forward-looking considerations) there is still a general lesson to\nbe learned: disputes about free will are often a function of\nunderlying disputes about the nature and value of moral\nresponsibility. \n\nAs should be clear from this short discussion of the history of the\nidea of free will, free will has traditionally been conceived of as a\nkind of power to control one’s choices and actions. When an\nagent exercises free will over her choices and actions, her choices\nand actions are up to her. But up to her in what sense? As\nshould be clear from our historical survey, two common (and\ncompatible) answers are: (i) up to her in the sense that she is able\nto choose otherwise, or at minimum that she is able not to choose or\nact as she does, and (ii) up to her in the sense that she is the\nsource of her action. However, there is widespread controversy both\nover whether each of these conditions is required for free will and if\nso, how to understand the kind or sense of freedom to do otherwise or\nsourcehood that is required. While some seek to resolve these\ncontroversies in part by careful articulation of our experiences of\ndeliberation, choice, and action (Nozick 1981, ch. 4; van Inwagen\n1983, ch. 1; O’Connor 2000, ch. 1), many seek to resolve these\ncontroversies by appealing to the nature of moral responsibility. The\nidea is that the kind of control or sense of up-to-meness involved in\nfree will is the kind of control or sense of up-to-meness relevant to\nmoral responsibility (Double 1992, 12; Ekstrom 2000, 7–8;\nSmilansky 2000, 16; Widerker and McKenna 2003, 2; Vargas 2007, 128;\nNelkin 2011, 151–52; Levy 2011, 1; Pereboom 2014,\n1–2). Indeed, some go so far as to define ‘free\nwill’ as ‘the strongest control condition—whatever\nthat turns out to be—necessary for moral responsibility’\n(Wolf 1990, 3–4; Fischer 1994, 3; Mele 2006, 17). Given this\nconnection, we can determine whether the freedom to do otherwise and\nthe power of self-determination are constitutive of free will and, if\nso, in what sense, by considering what it takes to be a morally\nresponsible agent. On these latter characterizations of free will,\nunderstanding free will is inextricably linked to, and perhaps even\nderivative from, understanding moral responsibility. And even those\nwho demur from this claim regarding conceptual priority typically see\na close link between these two ideas.  Consequently, to appreciate the\ncurrent debates surrounding the nature of free will, we need to say\nsomething about the nature of moral responsibility. \n\nIt is now widely accepted that there are different species of moral\nresponsibility. It is common (though not uncontroversial) to\ndistinguish moral responsibility as answerability from moral\nresponsibility as attributability from moral responsibility as\naccountability (Watson 1996; Fischer and Tognazzini 2011;\nShoemaker 2011. See Smith (2012) for a critique of this taxonomy).\nThese different species of moral responsibility differ along three\ndimensions: (i) the kind of responses licensed toward the responsible\nagent, (ii) the nature of the licensing relation, and (iii) the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for licensing the relevant kind of\nresponses toward the agent. For example, some argue that when an agent\nis morally responsible in the attributability sense, certain\njudgments about the agent—such as judgments concerning\nthe virtues and vices of the agent—are fitting, and that\nthe fittingness of such judgments does not depend on whether the agent\nin question possessed the freedom to do otherwise (cf. Watson\n1996). \n\nWhile keeping this controversy about the nature of moral\n responsibility firmly in mind (see the entry on\n moral responsibility\n for a\nmore detailed discussion of these issues), we think it is fair to say\nthat the most commonly assumed understanding of moral responsibility in\nthe historical and contemporary discussion of the problem of free will\nis moral responsibility as accountability in something like\nthe following sense: \n\nAn agent \\(S\\) is morally accountable for performing an action\n\\(\\phi\\) \\(=_{df.}\\) \\(S\\) deserves praise if \\(\\phi\\) goes beyond\nwhat can be reasonably expected of \\(S\\) and \\(S\\) deserves blame if\n\\(\\phi\\) is morally wrong. \n\nThe central notions in this definition are praise,\nblame, and desert. The majority of contemporary\nphilosophers have followed Strawson (1962) in contending that praising\nand blaming an agent consist in experiencing (or at least being\ndisposed to experience (cf. Wallace 1994, 70–71)) reactive\nattitudes or emotions directed toward the agent, such as gratitude,\napprobation, and pride in the case of praise, and resentment,\nindignation, and guilt in the case of blame. (See Sher (2006) and\n Scanlon (2008) for important dissensions from this trend. See\n the entry on blame\n for a more detailed discussion.) These emotions, in turn, dispose\nus to act in a variety of ways. For example, blame disposes us to\nrespond with some kind of hostility toward the blameworthy agent, such\nas verbal rebuke or partial withdrawal of good will. But while these\nkinds of dispositions are essential to our blaming someone, their\nmanifestation is not: it is possible to blame someone with very little\nchange in attitudes or actions toward the agent. Blaming someone might\nbe immediately followed by forgiveness as an end of the matter. \n\nBy ‘desert’, we have in mind what Derk Pereboom has\ncalled basic desert: \n\nThe desert at issue here is basic in the sense that the agent would\ndeserve to be blamed or praised just because she has performed the\naction, given an understanding of its moral status, and not, for\nexample, merely by virtue of consequentialist or contractualist\nconsiderations. (2014, 2) \n\nAs we understand desert, if an agent deserves blame, then we have a\nstrong pro tanto reason to blame him simply in virtue of his\nbeing accountable for doing wrong. Importantly, these reasons can be\noutweighed by other considerations. While an agent may deserve blame,\nit might, all things considered, be best to forgive him\nunconditionally instead. \n\nWhen an agent is morally responsible for doing something wrong, he is\nblameworthy: he deserves hard treatment marked by resentment\nand indignation and the actions these emotions dispose us toward, such\nas censure, rebuke, and ostracism. However, it would seem unfair to\ntreat agents in these ways unless their actions were up to\nthem. Thus, we arrive at the core connection between free will\nand moral responsibility: agents deserve praise or blame only if their\nactions are up to them—only if they have free\nwill. Consequently, we can assess analyses of free will by their\nimplications for judgments of moral responsibility. We note that some\nmight reject the claim that free will is necessary for moral\nresponsibility (e.g., Frankfurt 1971; Stump 1988), but even for these\ntheorists an adequate analysis of free will must specify\na sufficient condition for the kind of control at play in\nmoral responsibility. \n\nIn what follows, we focus our attention on the two most commonly cited\nfeatures of free will: the freedom to do otherwise and sourcehood.\nWhile some seem to think that free will consists exclusively in either\nthe freedom to do otherwise (van Inwagen 2008) or in sourcehood\n(Zagzebski 2000), we think that the majority of philosophers hold that\nfree will involves both conditions—though philosophers often\nemphasize one condition over the other depending on their dialectical\nsituation or argumentative purposes (cf. Watson 1987). In what\nfollows, we will describe the most common characterizations of these\ntwo conditions. \n\nFor most newcomers to the problem of free will, it will seem obvious\nthat an action is up to an agent only if she had the freedom to do\notherwise. But what does this freedom come to? The freedom to do\notherwise is clearly a modal property of agents, but it is\ncontroversial just what species of modality is at stake. It must be\nmore than mere possibility: to have the freedom to do\notherwise consists in more than the mere possibility of something\nelse’s happening. A more plausible and widely endorsed\nunderstanding claims the relevant modality is ability or\npower (Locke 1690 [1975], II.xx; Reid 1788 [1969],\nII.i–ii; D. Locke 1973; Clarke 2009; Vihvelin 2013). But\nabilities themselves seem to come in different varieties (Lewis 1976;\nHorgan 1979; van Inwagen 1983, ch. 1; Mele 2003; Clarke 2009; Vihvelin\n2013, ch. 1; Franklin 2015), so any claim that an agent has ‘the\nability to do otherwise’ is ambiguous or indeterminate unless\nthe sense of ability appealed to is spelled out. A satisfactory\naccount of the freedom to do otherwise owes us both an account of the\nkind of ability in terms of which the freedom to do otherwise is\nanalyzed, and an argument for why this kind of ability (as opposed to\nsome other species) is the one constitutive of the freedom to do\notherwise. As we will see, philosophers sometimes leave this second\ndebt unpaid. \n\nThe contemporary literature takes its cue from classical\ncompatibilism’s recognized failure to deliver a satisfactory\nanalysis of the freedom to do otherwise. As we saw above, classical\ncompatibilists (Hobbes 1654 [1999], 1656 [1999]; Locke 1690 [1975];\nHume 1740 [1978], 1748 [1975]; Edwards 1754 [1957]; Moore 1912;\nSchlick 1939; Ayer 1954) sought to analyze the freedom to do otherwise\nin terms of a simple conditional analysis of ability: \n\nSimple Conditional Analysis: An agent \\(S\\) has the\nability to do otherwise if and only if, were \\(S\\) to choose to do\notherwise, then \\(S\\) would do otherwise. \n\nPart of the attraction of this analysis is that it obviously\nreconciles the freedom to do otherwise with determinism. While the\ntruth of determinism entails that one’s action is inevitable\ngiven the past and laws of nature, there is nothing about determinism\nthat implies that if one had chosen otherwise, then one would\nnot do otherwise. \n\nThere are two problems with the Simple Conditional\nAnalysis. The first is that it is, at best, an analysis of\nfree action, not free will (cf. Reid 1788 [1969]; Chisholm 1966; 1976,\nch. 2; Lehrer 1968, 1976). It only tells us when an agent has the\nability to do otherwise, not when an agent has the ability to\nchoose to do otherwise. One might be tempted to think that\nthere is an easy fix along the following lines: \n\nSimple Conditional Analysis*: An agent \\(S\\) has the\nability to choose otherwise if and only if, were \\(S\\) to desire or\nprefer to choose otherwise, then \\(S\\) would choose otherwise. \n\nThe problem is that we often fail to choose to do things we want to\nchoose, even when it appears that we had the ability to choose\notherwise (one might think the same problem attends the original\nanalysis). Suppose that, in deciding how to spend my evening, I have a\ndesire to choose to read and a desire to choose to watch a movie.\nSuppose that I choose to read. By all appearances, I had the ability\nto choose to watch a movie. And yet, according to the Simple\nConditional Analysis*, I lack this freedom, since the\nconditional ‘if I were to desire to choose to watch a movie,\nthen I would choose to watch a movie’ is false. I do desire to\nchoose to watch a movie and yet I do not choose to watch a movie. It\nis unclear how to remedy this problem. On the one hand, we might\nrefine the antecedent by replacing ‘desire’ with\n‘strongest desire’ (cf. Hobbes 1654 [1999], 1656 [1999];\nEdwards 1754 [1957]). The problem is that this assumes, implausibly,\nthat we always choose what we most strongly desire (for criticisms of\nthis view see Reid 1788 [1969]; Campbell 1951; Wallace 1999; Holton\n2009). On the other hand, we might refine the consequent by replacing\n‘would choose to do otherwise’ with either ‘would\nprobably choose to do otherwise’ or ‘might choose to do\notherwise’.  But each of these proposals is also problematic. If\n‘probably’ means ‘more likely than not’, then\nthis revised conditional still seems too strong: it seems possible to\nhave the ability to choose otherwise even when one’s so choosing\nis unlikely. If we opt for ‘might’, then the relevant\nsense of modality needs to be spelled out. \n\nEven if there are fixes to these problems, there is a yet deeper\nproblem with these analyses. There are some agents who clearly lack\nthe freedom to do otherwise and yet satisfy the conditional at the\nheart of these analyses. That is, although these agents lack the\nfreedom to do otherwise, it is, for example, true of them\nthat if they chose otherwise, they would do\notherwise. Picking up on an argument developed by Keith Lehrer (1968;\ncf. Campbell 1951; Broad 1952; Chisholm 1966), consider an\nagoraphobic, Luke, who, when faced with the prospect of entering an\nopen space, is subject not merely to an irresistible desire to refrain\nfrom intentionally going outside, but an irresistible desire to\nrefrain from even choosing to go outside. Given Luke’s\npsychology, there is no possible world in which he suffers from his\nagoraphobia and chooses to go outside. It may well nevertheless be\ntrue that if Luke chose to go outside, then he would have\ngone outside. After all, any possible world in which he chooses to go\noutside will be a world in which he no longer suffers (to the same\ndegree) from his agoraphobia, and thus we have no reason to doubt that\nin those worlds he would go outside as a result of his choosing to go\noutside. The same kind of counterexample applies with equal force to\nthe conditional ‘if \\(S\\) desired to choose otherwise, then\n\\(S\\) would choose otherwise’. \n\nWhile simple conditional analyses admirably make clear the species of\nability to which they appeal, they fail to show that this species of\nability is constitutive of the freedom to do otherwise. Agents need a\nstronger ability to do otherwise than characterized by such simple\nconditionals. Some argue that the fundamental source of the above\nproblems is the conditional nature of these analyses\n(Campbell 1951; Austin 1961; Chisholm 1966; Lehrer 1976; van Inwagen\n1983, ch.  4). The sense of ability relevant to the freedom to do\notherwise is the ‘all-in sense’—that is, holding\neverything fixed up to the time of the decision or action—and\nthis sense, so it is argued, can only be captured by a categorical\nanalysis of the ability to do otherwise: \n\nCategorical Analysis: An agent \\(S\\) has the ability\nto choose or do otherwise than \\(\\phi\\) at time \\(t\\) if and only if\nit was possible, holding fixed everything up to \\(t\\), that \\(S\\)\nchoose or do otherwise than \\(\\phi\\) at \\(t\\). \n\nThis analysis gets the right verdict in Luke’s case. He lacks\nthe ability to do otherwise than refrain from choosing to go outside,\naccording to this analysis, because there is no possible world in\nwhich he suffers from his agoraphobia and yet chooses to go\noutside. Unlike the above conditional analyses,\nthe Categorical Analysis requires that we hold fixed\nLuke’s agoraphobia when considering alternative\npossibilities. \n\nIf the Categorical Analysis is correct, then free\nwill is incompatible with determinism. According to the thesis of\ndeterminism, all deterministic possible worlds with the same pasts and\nlaws of nature have the same futures (Lewis 1979; van Inwagen 1983,\n3). Suppose John is in deterministic world \\(W\\) and refrains from\nraising his hand at time \\(t\\). Since \\(W\\) is deterministic, it\nfollows that any possible world \\(W^*\\) that has the same past and\nlaws up to \\(t\\) must have the same future, including John’s\nrefraining from raising his hand at \\(t\\). Therefore, John lacked the\nability, and thus freedom, to raise his hand. \n\nThis argument, carefully articulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s\nby Carl Ginet (1966, 1990) and Peter van Inwagen (1975, 1983) and\nrefined in important ways by John Martin Fischer (1994), has come to\nbe known as the Consequence Argument. van Inwagen offers the following\ninformal statement of the argument: \n\nIf determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws\nof nature and events in the remote past. But it is not up to us what\nwent on before we were born [i.e., we do not have the ability to change \nthe past], and neither is it up to us what the laws of nature are [i.e., \nwe do not have the ability to break the laws of nature]. Therefore, the \nconsequences of these things (including our present acts) are not up to us. \n(van Inwagen 1983, 16; cf. Fischer 1994, ch. 1) \n\nLike the Simple Conditional Analysis, a virtue of\nthe Categorical Analysis is that it spells out\nclearly the kind of ability appealed to in its analysis of the freedom\nto do otherwise, but like the Simple Conditional\nAnalysis, critics have argued that the sense of ability it\ncaptures is not the sense at the heart of free will. The objection\nhere, though, is not that the analysis is too permissive or weak, but\nrather that it is too restrictive or strong. \n\nWhile there have been numerous different replies along these lines\n (e.g., Lehrer 1980; Slote 1982; Watson 1986. See the entry on\n arguments for incompatibilism\n for a more extensive discussion of and\nbibliography for the Consequence Argument), the most influential of\nthese objections is due to David Lewis (1981). Lewis contended that\nvan Inwagen’s argument equivocated on ‘is able to break a\nlaw of nature’. We can distinguish two senses of ‘is able\nto break a law of nature’: \n\n(Weak Thesis) I am able to do something such that, if I did it, a law\nof nature would be broken. \n\n(Strong Thesis) I am able to do something such that, if I did it, it\nwould constitute a law of nature’s being broken or would cause a\nlaw of nature to be broken. \n\nIf we are committed to the Categorical Analysis,\nthen those desiring to defend compatibilism seem to be committed to the sense of ability in ‘is able to break\na law of nature’ along the lines of the strong thesis. Lewis\nagrees with van Inwagen that it is “incredible” to think\nhumans have such an ability (Lewis 1981, 113), but maintains that\ncompatibilists need only appeal to the ability to break a law of nature\nin the weak sense. While it is absurd to think that humans are able to\ndo something that is a violation of a law of nature or\ncauses a law of nature to be broken, there is nothing\nincredible, so Lewis claimed, in thinking that humans are able to do\nsomething such that if they did it, a law of nature would be\nbroken. In essence, Lewis is arguing that incompatibilists like van\nInwagen have failed to adequately motivate the restrictiveness of the\nCategorical Analysis. \n\nSome incompatibilists have responded to Lewis by contending that even\nthe weak ability is incredible (O’Connor 2000, ch.1; van Inwagen\n2004). But there is a different and often overlooked problem for\nLewis: the weak ability seems to be too weak. Returning to the case of\nJohn’s refraining from raising his hand, Lewis maintains that\nthe following three propositions are consistent: \n\nOne might think that (ii) and (iii) are incompatible with (i).\nConsider again Luke, our agoraphobic. Suppose that his agoraphobia\naffects him in such a way that he will only intentionally go outside\nif he chooses to go outside, and yet his agoraphobia makes it\nimpossible for him to make this choice. In this case, a necessary\ncondition for Luke’s intentionally going outside is his choosing\nto go outside.  Moreover, Luke is not able to choose or cause himself\nto choose to go outside. Intuitively, this would seem to imply that\nLuke lacks the freedom to go outside. But this implication\ndoes not follow for Lewis. From the fact that Luke is able to go\noutside only if he chooses to go outside and the fact that Luke is not\nable to choose to go outside, it does not follow, on\nLewis’s account, that Luke lacks the ability to go\noutside. Consequently, Lewis’s account fails to explain why Luke\nlacks the ability to go outside (cf.  Speak 2011). (For other\nimportant criticisms of Lewis, see Ginet [1990, ch. 5] and Fischer\n[1994, ch. 4].) \n\nWhile Lewis may be right that the Categorical\nAnalysis is too restrictive, his argument, all by itself,\ndoesn’t seem to establish this. His argument is successful only\nif (a) he can provide an alternative analysis of ability that entails\nthat Luke’s agoraphobia robs him of the ability to go outside and\n(b) does not entail that determinism robs John of the ability to raise\nhis hand (cf. Pendergraft 2010). Lewis must point out a principled\ndifference between these two cases. As should be clear from the above,\nthe Simple Conditional Analysis is of no help.\nHowever, some recent work by Michael Smith (2003), Kadri Vihvelin\n(2004; 2013), and Michael Fara (2008) have attempted to fill this gap.\nWhat unites these theorists—whom Clarke (2009) has called the\n‘new dispositionalists’—is their attempt to appeal to\nrecent advances in the metaphysics of dispositions to arrive at a\nrevised conditional analysis of the freedom to do otherwise. The most\nperspicuous of these accounts is offered by Vihvelin (2004), who argues\nthat an agent’s having the ability to do otherwise is solely a\nfunction of the agent’s intrinsic properties. (It is important to\nnote that Vihvelin [2013] has come to reject the view that free will\nconsists exclusively in the kind of ability analyzed below.) Building\non Lewis’s work on the metaphysics of dispositions, she arrives\nat the following analysis of ability: \n\nRevised Conditional Analysis of Ability: \\(S\\) has\nthe ability at time \\(t\\) to do \\(X\\) iff, for some intrinsic property\nor set of properties \\(B\\) that \\(S\\) has at \\(t\\), for some time\n\\(t'\\) after \\(t\\), if \\(S\\) chose (decided, intended, or tried) at\n\\(t\\) to do \\(X\\), and \\(S\\) were to retain \\(B\\) until \\(t'\\),\n\\(S\\)’s choosing (deciding, intending, or trying) to do \\(X\\)\nand \\(S\\)’s having \\(B\\) would jointly be an \\(S\\)-complete\ncause of \\(S\\)’s doing \\(X\\). (Vihvelin 2004, 438) \n\nLewis defines an ‘\\(S\\)-complete cause’ as “a cause\ncomplete insofar as havings of properties intrinsic to [\\(S\\)] are\nconcerned, though perhaps omitting some events extrinsic to\n[\\(S\\)]” (cf. Lewis 1997, 156). In other words, an\n\\(S\\)-complete cause of \\(S\\)’s doing \\(\\phi\\) requires that\n\\(S\\) possess all the intrinsic properties relevant to \\(S\\)’s\ncausing \\(S\\)’s doing \\(\\phi\\). This analysis appears to afford\nVihvelin the basis for a principled difference between agoraphobics\nand merely determined agents. We must hold fixed an agent’s\nphobias since they are intrinsic properties of agents, but we need not\nhold fixed the laws of nature because these are not intrinsic\nproperties of agents. (It should be noted that the assumption that\nintrinsic properties are wholly separable from the laws of nature is\n disputed by ‘dispositional essentialists.’ See the entry on\n metaphysics of causation.)\n Vihvelin’s analysis appears to be restrictive enough to\nexclude phobics from having the freedom to do otherwise, but\npermissive enough to allow that some agents in deterministic worlds\nhave the freedom to do otherwise. \n\nBut appearances can be deceiving. The new dispositionalist claims\nhave received some serious criticism, with the majority of the\ncriticisms maintaining that these analyses are still too permissive\n(Clarke 2009; Whittle 2010; Franklin 2011b). For example, Randolph\nClarke argues that Vihvelin’s analysis fails to overcome the\noriginal problem with the Simple Conditional Analysis.\nHe writes, “A phobic agent might, on some occasion, be unable to\nchoose to A and unable to A without so choosing,\nwhile retaining all that she would need to implement such a choice,\nshould she make it. Despite lacking the ability to choose to\nA, the agent might have some set of intrinsic properties\nB such that, if she chose to A and retained\nB, then her choosing to A and her having B\nwould jointly be an agent-complete cause of her A-ing”\n(Clarke 2009, p. 329). \n\nThe Categorical Analysis, and thus incompatibilism\nabout free will and determinism, remains an attractive option for many\nphilosophers precisely because it seems that compatibilists have yet to\nfurnish an analysis of the freedom to do otherwise that implies that\nphobics clearly lack the ability to choose or do otherwise that is\nrelevant to moral responsibility and yet some merely determined agents\nhave this ability. \n\nSome have tried to avoid these lingering problems for compatibilists\nby arguing that the freedom to do otherwise is not required for free\nwill or moral responsibility. What matters for an agent’s\nfreedom and responsibility, so it is argued, is the source of\nher action—how her action was brought about. The most prominent\nstrategy for defending this move appeals to ‘Frankfurt-style\ncases’. In a ground-breaking piece, Harry Frankfurt (1969)\npresented a series of thought experiments intended to show that it is\npossible that agents are morally responsible for their actions and yet\nthey lack the ability to do otherwise. While Frankfurt (1971) took\nthis to show that moral responsibility and free will come\napart—free will requires the ability to do otherwise but moral\nresponsibility does not—if we define ‘free will’ as\n‘the strongest control condition required for moral\nresponsibility’ (cf. Wolf 1990, 3–4; Fischer 1994, 3; Mele\n2006, 17), then if Frankfurt-style cases show that moral\nresponsibility does not require the ability to do otherwise, then they\nalso show that free will does not require the ability to do\notherwise. Let us consider this challenge in more detail. \n\nHere is a representative Frankfurt-style case: \n\nImagine, if you will, that Black is a quite nifty (and even generally\nnice) neurosurgeon. But in performing an operation on Jones to remove\na brain tumor, Black inserts a mechanism into Jones’s brain\nwhich enables Black to monitor and control Jones’s\nactivities. Jones, meanwhile, knows nothing of this. Black exercises\nthis control through a sophisticated computer which he has programmed\nso that, among other things, it monitors Jones’s voting\nbehavior.  If Jones were to show any inclination to vote for Bush,\nthen the computer, through the mechanism in Jones’s brain,\nintervenes to ensure that he actually decides to vote for Clinton and\ndoes so vote.  But if Jones decides on his own to vote for Clinton,\nthe computer does nothing but continue to monitor—without\naffecting—the goings-on in Jones’s head. (Fischer 2006,\n38) \n\nFischer goes on to suppose that Jones “decides to vote for\nClinton on his own”, without any interference from Black, and\nmaintains that in such a case Jones is morally responsible for his\ndecision. Fischer draws two interrelated conclusions from this case.\nThe first, negative conclusion, is that the ability to do otherwise is\nnot necessary for moral responsibility. Jones is unable to refrain\nfrom deciding to vote for Clinton, and yet, so long as Jones decides\nto vote for Clinton on his own, his decision is free and one for which\nhe is morally responsible. The second, positive conclusion, is that\nfreedom and responsibility are functions of the\nactual sequence. What matters for an agent’s freedom\nand moral responsibility is not what might have happened, but how his\naction was actually brought about. What matters is not whether the\nagent had the ability to do otherwise, but whether he was the source\nof his actions. \n\nThe success of Frankfurt-style cases is hotly contested. An early\nand far-reaching criticism is due to David Widerker (1995), Carl Ginet\n(1996), and Robert Kane (1996, 142–43). According to this\ncriticism, proponents of Frankfurt-style cases face a dilemma: either\nthese cases assume that the connection between the indicator (in our\ncase, the absence of Jones’s showing any inclination to decide to\nvote for Bush) and the agent’s decision (here, Jones’s\ndeciding to vote for Clinton) is deterministic or not. If the\nconnection is deterministic, then Frankfurt-style cases cannot be\nexpected to convince incompatibilists that the ability to do otherwise\nis not necessary for moral responsibility and/or free will, since\nJones’s action will be deterministically brought about by factors\nbeyond his control, leading incompatibilists to conclude that Jones is\nnot morally responsible for his decision. But if the connection is\nnondeterministic, then it is possible even in the absence of showing\nany inclination to decide to vote for Bush, that Jones decides to vote\nfor Bush, and so he retains the ability to do otherwise. Either way\nFrankfurt-style cases fail to show that Jones is both morally\nresponsible for his decision and yet is unable to do otherwise. \n\nWhile some have argued that even Frankfurt-style cases that assume\ndeterminism are effective (see, e.g., Fischer 1999, 2010, 2013 and\nHaji and McKenna 2004 and for criticisms of this approach, see Goetz\n2005, Palmer 2005, 2014, Widerker and Goetz 2013, and Cohen 2017), the\nmajority of proponents of Frankfurt-style cases have attempted to\nrevise these cases so that they are explicitly nondeterministic and\nyet still show that the agent was morally responsible even though he\nlacked the ability to do otherwise—or, at least that he lacked\nany ability to do otherwise that could be relevant\nto grounding the agent’s moral responsibility (see,\ne.g., Mele and Robb 1998, 2003, Pereboom 2001, 2014, McKenna 2003,\nHunt 2005, and for criticisms of these cases see Ginet 2002, Timpe\n2006, Widerker 2006, Franklin 2011c, Moya 2011, Palmer 2011, 2013,\nRobinson 2014, Capes 2016, Capes and Swenson 2017, and Elzein\n2017). \n\nSupposing that Frankfurt-style cases are successful, what exactly\ndo they show? In our view, they show neither that free will\nand moral responsibility do not require an ability to do otherwise\nin any sense nor that compatibilism is true. Frankfurt-style\ncases are of clear help to the compatibilists’ position (though\nsee Speak 2007 for a dissenting opinion). The Consequence Argument\nraises a powerful challenge to the cogency of compatibilism. But if\nFrankfurt-style cases are successful, agents can act freely in the\nsense relevant to moral responsibility while lacking the ability to do\notherwise in the all-in sense. This allows compatibilists to concede\nthat the all-in ability to do otherwise is incompatible with\ndeterminism, and yet insist that it is irrelevant to the question of\nthe compatibility of determinism with moral responsibility (and\nperhaps even free will, depending on how we define this) (cf. Fischer\n1987, 1994. For a challenge to the move from not strictly necessary to\nirrelevant, see O’Connor [2000, 20–22] and in reply,\nFischer [2006, 152–56].). But, of course, showing that an\nargument for the falsity of compatibilism is irrelevant does not show\nthat compatibilism is true. Indeed, many incompatibilists maintain\nthat Frankfurt-style cases are successful and defend incompatibilism\nnot via the Consequence Argument, but by way of arguments that attempt\nto show that agents in deterministic worlds cannot be the\n‘source’ of their actions in the way that moral\nresponsibility requires (Stump 1999; Zagzebski 2000; Pereboom 2001,\n2014). Thus, if successful, Frankfurt-style cases would be at best the\nfirst step in defending compatibilism. The second step must offer an\nanalysis of the kind of sourcehood constitutive of free will that\nentails that free will is compatible with determinism (cf. Fischer\n1982). \n\nFurthermore, while proponents of Frankfurt-style cases often maintain\nthat these cases show that no ability to do otherwise is necessary for\nmoral responsibility (“I have employed the Frankfurt-type\nexample to argue that this sense of control [i.e. the one required for\nmoral responsibility] need not involve any alternative\npossibilities” [Fischer 2006, p. 58; emphasis ours]), we believe\nthat this conclusion overreaches. At best, Frankfurt-style cases\nshow that the ability to do otherwise in the all-in\nsense—in the sense defined by the Categorical\nAnalysis—is not necessary for free will or moral\nresponsibility (cf. Franklin 2015). To appreciate this, let us assume\nthat in the above Frankfurt-style case Jones lacks the ability to do\notherwise in the all-in sense: there is no possible world in which we\nhold fixed the past and laws and yet Jones does otherwise, since all\nsuch worlds include Black and his preparations for preventing Jones\nfrom doing otherwise should Jones show any inclination. Even if this\nis all true, it should take only a little reflection to recognize that\nin this case Jones is able to do otherwise in certain weaker senses we\nmight attach to that phrase, and compatibilists in fact still think\nthat the ability to do otherwise in some such senses is necessary for\nfree will and moral responsibility. Consequently, even though\nFrankfurt-style cases have, as a matter of fact, moved many\ncompatibilists away from emphasizing ability to do otherwise to\nemphasizing sourcehood, we suggest that this move is best seen as a\nweakening of the ability-to-do-otherwise condition on moral\nresponsibility. (A potentially important exception to\nthis claim is Sartorio [2016], who appealing to some controversial\nideas in the metaphysics of causation appears to argue that no sense\nof the ability to do otherwise is necessary for control in the sense\nat stake for moral responsibility, but instead what matters is whether\nthe agent is the cause of the action. We simply note that\nSartorio’s account of causation is a modal one [see especially\nSartorio (2016, 94–95, 132–37)] and thus it is far from\nclear that her account of freedom and responsibility is really an\nexception.) \n\nIn this section, we will assume that Frankfurt-style cases are\nsuccessful in order to consider two prominent compatibilist attempts\nto construct analyses of the sourcehood condition (though see\n the entry on \n compatibilism\n for a more systematic survey of compatibilist\ntheories of free will). The first, and perhaps most popular,\ncompatibilist model is a reasons-responsiveness model. According to\nthis model, an agent’s action \\(\\phi\\) is free just in case the\nagent or manner in which the action is brought about is responsive to\nthe reasons available to the agent at the time of action. While\ncompatibilists develop this kind of account in different ways, the\nmost detailed proposal is due to John Martin Fischer (1994, 2006,\n2010, 2012; Fischer and Ravizza 1998. For similar compatibilist\ntreatments of reasons-responsiveness, see Wolf 1990, Wallace 1994,\nHaji 1998, Nelkin 2011, McKenna 2013, Vargas 2013, Sartorio\n2016). Fischer and Ravizza argue that an agent’s action is free\nand one for which he is morally responsible only if the mechanism that\nissued in the action is moderately reasons-responsive (Fischer and\nRavizza 1998, ch. 3). By ‘mechanism’, Fischer and Ravizza\nsimply mean “the way the action was brought about”\n(38). One mechanism they often discuss is practical deliberation. For\nexample, in the case of Jones discussed above, his decision to vote\nfor Clinton on his own was brought about by the process of practical\ndeliberation. What must be true of this process, this mechanism, for\nit to be moderately reasons-responsive? Fischer and Ravizza maintain\nthat moderate reasons-responsiveness consists in two conditions:\nreasons-receptivity and reasons-reactivity. A mechanism’s\nreasons-receptivity depends on the agent’s cognitive capacities,\nsuch as being capable of understanding moral reasons and the\nimplications of their actions (69–73). The second condition is\nmore important for us in the present context. A mechanism’s\nreasons-reactivity depends on how the mechanism would react\ngiven different reasons for action.  Fischer and Ravizza argue that\nthe kind of reasons-reactivity at stake is weak reasons-reactivity,\nwhere this merely requires that there is some possible world in which\nthe laws of nature remain the same, the same mechanism operates,\nthere is a sufficient reason to do otherwise, and the mechanism brings\nabout this the alternative action in response to this sufficient\nreason (73–76). On this analysis, while Jones, due to the\nactivity of Black, lacks the all-in sense of the ability to do\notherwise, he is nevertheless morally responsible for deciding to vote\nfor Clinton because his action finds its source in Jones’s\npractical deliberation that is moderately\nreasons-responsive. \n\nFischer and Ravizza offer a novel and powerful theory of freedom and\nresponsibility, one that has shifted the focus of recent debate to\nquestions of sourcehood. Moreover, one might argue that this theory is\na clear improvement over classical compatibilism with respect to\nhandling cases of phobia. By focusing on mechanisms, Fischer and\nRavizza can argue that our agoraphobic Luke is not morally responsible\nfor deciding to refrain from going outside because the mechanism that\nissues in this action—namely his agoraphobia—is not\nmoderately reasons-responsive. There is no world with the same laws of\nnature as our own, this mechanism operates, and yet it reacts to a\nsufficient reason to go outside. No matter what reasons there are for\nLuke to go outside, when acting on this mechanism, he will always\nrefrain from going outside (cf. Fischer 1987, 74). \n\nBefore turning to our second compatibilist model, it is worth noting\nthat it would be a mistake to think that Fischer and Ravizza’s\naccount is a sourcehood account to the exclusion of the ability to do\notherwise in any sense. As we have just seen, Fischer and\nRavizza place clear modal requirements on mechanisms that\nissue in actions with respect to which agents are free and morally\nresponsible. Indeed, this should be clear from the very idea of\nreasons-responsiveness. Whether one is responsive depends not merely\non how one does respond, but also on how one would\nrespond. Thus, any account that makes reasons-responsiveness an\nessential condition of free will is an account that makes the ability\nto do otherwise, in some sense, necessary for free will (Fischer\n[forthcoming] concedes this point, though, as noted above, the reader\nshould consider Sartorio [2016] as a potential counterexample to this\nclaim). \n\nThe second main compatibilist model of sourcehood is an identification\nmodel. Accounts of sourcehood of this kind lay stress on\nself-determination or autonomy: to be the source of her action the\nagent must self-determine her action. Like the contemporary discussion\nof the ability to do otherwise, the contemporary discussion of the\npower of self-determination begins with the failure of classical\ncompatibilism to produce an acceptable definition. According to\nclassical compatibilists, self-determination simply consists in the\nagent’s action being determined by her strongest motive. On the\nassumption that some compulsive agents’ compulsions operate by\ngenerating irresistible desires to act in certain ways, the classical\ncompatibilist analysis of self-determination implies that these\ncompulsive actions are self-determined. While Hobbes seems willing to\naccept this implication (1656 [1999], 78), most contemporary\ncompatibilists concede that this result is unacceptable. \n\nBeginning with the work of Harry Frankfurt (1971) and Gary Watson\n(1975), many compatibilists have developed identification accounts of\nself-determination that attempt to draw a distinction between an\nagent’s desires or motives that are internal to the agent and\nfrom those that are external. The idea is that while agents are not\n(or at least may not be) identical to any motivations (or bundle of\nmotivations), they are identified with a subset of their\nmotivations, rendering these motivations internal to the agent in such\na way that any actions brought about by these motivations are\nself-determined. The identification relation is not an\nidentity relation, but something weaker (cf. Bratman 2000, 39n12). What\nthe precise nature of the identification relation is and to which\nattitudes an agent stands in this relation is hotly disputed.\nLippert-Rasmussen (2003) helpfully divides identification accounts into\ntwo main types. The first are “authority” accounts,\naccording to which agents are identified with attitudes that are\nauthorized to speak for them (386). The second are\nauthenticity accounts, according to which agents are identified with\nattitudes that reveal who they truly are (368). (But see\nShoemaker 2015 for an ecumenical account of identification that blends\nthese two accounts.) Proposed attitudes to which agents are said to\nstand in the identification relation include higher-order desires\n(Frankfurt 1971), cares or loves (Frankfurt 1993, 1994; Shoemaker 2003;\nJaworska 2007; Sripada 2016), self-governing policies (Bratman 2000),\nthe desire to make sense of oneself (Velleman 1992, 2009), and\nperceptions (or judgments) of the good (or best) (Watson 1975; Stump\n1988; Ekstrom 1993; Mitchell-Yellin 2015). \n\nThe distinction between internal and external motivations allows\nidentification theorists to enrich classical compatibilists’\nunderstanding of constraint, while remaining compatibilists about free\nwill and determinism. According to classical compatibilists, the only\nkind of constraint is external (e.g., broken cars and broken legs),\nbut addictions and phobias seem just as threatening to free will.\nIdentification theorists have the resources to concede that some\nconstraints are internal. For example, they can argue that our\nagoraphobic Luke is not free in refraining from going outside even\nthough this decision was caused by his strongest desires because he is\nnot identified with his strongest desires. On compatibilist\nidentification accounts, what matters for self-determination is not\nwhether our actions are determined or undetermined, but whether they\nare brought about by motives with which the agent is identified:\nexercises of the power of self-determination consists in an\nagent’s actions being brought about, in part, by an\nagent’s motives with which she is identified. (It is important\nto note that while we have distinguished reasons-responsive accounts\nfrom identification accounts, there is nothing preventing one from\ncombing both elements in a complete analysis of free will.) \n\nEven if these reasons-responsive and identification compatibilist\naccounts of sourcehood might successfully side-step the Consequence\nArgument, they must come to grips with a second incompatibilist\nargument: the Manipulation Argument. The general problem raised by\nthis line of argument is that whatever proposed compatibilist\nconditions for an agent \\(S\\)’s being free with respect to, and\nmorally responsible for, some action \\(\\phi\\), it will seem that\nagents can be manipulated into satisfying these conditions with\nrespect to \\(\\phi\\) and, yet, precisely because they are manipulated\ninto satisfying these conditions, their freedom and responsibility\nseem undermined. The two most influential forms of the Manipulation\nArgument are Pereboom’s Four-case Argument (2001, ch. 4; 2014,\nch. 4) and Mele’s Zygote Argument (2006, ch. 7. See Todd 2010,\n2012 for developments of Mele’s argument). As the structure of\nMele’s version is simpler, we will focus on it. \n\nImagine a goddess Diana who creates a zygote \\(Z\\) in Mary in some\ndeterministic world. Suppose that Diana creates \\(Z\\) as she does\nbecause she wants Jones to be murdered thirty years later. From her\nknowledge of the laws of nature in her world and her knowledge of the\nstate of the world just prior to her creating \\(Z\\), she knows that a\nzygote with precisely \\(Z\\)’s constitution located in Mary will\ndevelop into an agent Ernie who, thirty years later, will murder Jones\nas a result of his moderately reasons-responsive mechanism and on the\nbasis of motivations with which he is identified (whatever those might\nbe).  Suppose Diana succeeds in her plan and Ernie murders Jones as a\nresult of her manipulation. \n\nMany judge that Ernie is not morally responsible for murdering Jones\neven though he satisfies both the reasons-responsive and\nidentification criteria. There are two possible lines of reply open to\ncompatibilists.  On the soft-line reply, compatibilists attempt to\nshow that there is a relevant difference between manipulated agents\nsuch as Ernie and agents who satisfy their account (McKenna 2008,\n470). For example, Fischer and Ravizza propose a second condition on\nsourcehood: in addition to a mechanism’s being moderately\nreasons-responsive, an agent is morally responsible for the output of\nsuch a mechanism only if the agent has come to take responsibility for\nthe mechanism, where an agent has taken responsibility for a mechanism\n\\(M\\) just in case (i) she believes that she is an agent when acting\nfrom \\(M\\), (ii) she believes that she is an apt target for blame and\npraise for acting from \\(M\\), and (iii) her beliefs specified in (i)\nand (ii) are “based, in an appropriate way, on [her]\nevidence” (Fischer and Ravizza 1998, 238). The problem with this\nreply is that we can easily imagine Diana creating Ernie so that his\nmurdering Jones is a result not only of a moderately\nreasons-responsive mechanism, but also a mechanism for which he has\ntaken responsibility. On the hard-line reply, compatibilists concede\nthat, despite initial appearances, the manipulated agent is free and\nmorally responsible and attempt to ameliorate the seeming counterintuitiveness of this concession (McKenna\n2008, 470–71). Here compatibilists might point out that the idea\nof being manipulated is worrisome only so long as the manipulators are\ninterfering with an agent’s development. But if the manipulators\nsimply create a person, and then allow that person’s life to\nunfold without any further inference, the manipulators’ activity\nis no threat to freedom (McKenna 2008; Fischer 2011; Sartorio 2016,\nch. 5). (For other responses to the Manipulation Argument, see Kearns\n2012; Sripada 2012; McKenna 2014.) \n\nDespite these compatibilist replies, to some the idea that the\nentirety of a free agent’s life can be determined, and\nin this way controlled, by another agent will seem incredible. Some\ntake the lesson of the Manipulation Argument to be that no\ncompatibilist account of sourcehood or self-determination is\nsatisfactory. True sourcehood—the kind of sourcehood that can\nactually ground an agent’s freedom and\nresponsibility—requires, so it is argued, that one’s\naction not be causally determined by factors beyond one’s\ncontrol. \n\nLibertarians, while united in endorsing this negative condition on\nsourcehood, are deeply divided concerning which further positive\nconditions may be required. It is important to note that while\nlibertarians are united in insisting that compatibilist accounts of\nsourcehood are insufficient, they are not committed to thinking that\nthe conditions of freedom spelled out in terms either of\nreasons-responsiveness or of identification are not necessary. For\nexample, Stump (1988, 1996, 2010) builds a sophisticated libertarian\nmodel of free will out of resources originally developed within\nFrankfurt’s identification model (see also Ekstrom 1993, 2000;\nFranklin 2014) and nearly all libertarians agree that exercises of\nfree will require agents to be reasons-responsive (e.g., Kane 1996;\nO’Connor 2009a; Clarke 2003, chs. 8–9; Franklin 2018, ch. 2). Moreover, while\nthis section focuses on libertarian accounts of sourcehood, we remind\nreaders that most (if not all) libertarians think that the freedom to\ndo otherwise is also necessary for free will and moral\nresponsibility. \n\nThere are three main libertarian options for understanding sourcehood\nor self-determination: non-causal libertarianism (Ginet 1990, 2008;\nMcCann 1998; Lowe 2008; Goetz 2009; Pink 2017), event-causal\nlibertarianism (Wiggins 1973; Kane 1996, 1999, 2011, 2016; Mele 1995,\nchs. 11–12; 2006, chs. 4–5; 2017; Ekstrom 2000,\nforthcoming; Clarke 2003, chs. 2–6; Franklin 2018), and\nagent-causal libertarianism (Reid 1788 [1969]; Chisholm 1966, 1976;\nTaylor 1966; O’Connor 2000, 2005, 2009a; Clarke 1993; 1996;\n2003, chs. 8–10; Griffith 2010; Steward 2012). Non-causal\nlibertarians contend that exercises of the power of self-determination\nneed not (or perhaps even cannot) be caused or causally\nstructured. According to this view, we control our volition or choice\nsimply in virtue of its being ours—its occurring in us. We do\nnot exert a special kind of causality in bringing it about; instead,\nit is an intrinsically active event, intrinsically something\nwe do. While there may be causal influences upon our choice,\nthere need not be, and any such causal influence is wholly irrelevant\nto understanding why it occurs. Reasons provide an autonomous,\nnon-causal form of explanation. Provided our choice is not wholly\ndetermined by prior factors, it is free and under our control simply\nin virtue of being ours. Non-causal views have failed to garner wide\nsupport among libertarians since, for many,\nself-determination seems to be an essentially causal notion\n(cf. O’Connor 1993; 2000, ch. 2; Mele 2000; Clarke 2003, ch.\n2). \n\nMost libertarians endorse an event-causal or agent-causal account of\nsourcehood. Both these accounts maintain that exercises of the power\nof self-determination consist partly in the agent’s bringing\nabout her choice or action, but they disagree on how to analyze an\nagent’s bringing about her choice. While event-causal\nlibertarianism admits of different species, at the heart of this view\nis the idea that self-determining an action requires, at minimum, that\nthe agent cause the action and that an agent’s causing his\naction is wholly reducible to mental states and other events\ninvolving the agent nondeviantly causing his action. Consider an\nagent’s raising his hand. According to the event-causal model at\nits most basic level, an agent’s raising his hand consists in\nthe agent’s causing his hand to rise and his causing his hand to\nrise consists in apt mental states and events involving the\nagent—such as the agent’s desire to ask a question and his\nbelief that he can ask a question by raising his\nhand—nondeviantly causing his hand to rise. (The\nnondeviance clause is required since it seems possible that an event\nbe brought about by one’s desires and beliefs and yet not be\nself-determined, or even an action for that matter, due to the unusual\ncausal path leading from the desires and beliefs to action. Imagine a\nwould-be accomplice of an assassin believes that his dropping his\ncigarette is the signal for the assassin to shoot his intended victim\nand he desires to drop his cigarette and yet this belief and desire so\nunnerve him that he accidentally drops his cigarette. While the event\nof dropping the cigarette is caused by a relevant desire and belief it\ndoes not seem to be self-determined and perhaps is not even an action\n[cf. Davidson 1973].) To fully spell out this account, event-causal\nlibertarians must specify which mental states and events are apt (cf.\nBrand 1979)—which mental states and events are the springs of\nself-determined actions—and what nondeviance consists in (cf.\nBishop 1989). (We note that this has proven very difficult, enough so\nthat some take the problem to spell doom for event-causal theories of\naction. Such philosophers [e.g., Taylor 1966 and Sehon 2005] take\nagential power to be conceptually and/or ontologically primitive and\nunderstand reasons explanations of action in irreducibly teleological\nterms. See Stout 2010 for a brisk survey of discussions of this\ntopic.)  For ease, in what follows we will assume that apt mental\nstates are an agent’s reasons that favor the action. \n\nEvent-causal libertarians, of course, contend that self-determination\nrequires more than nondeviant causation by agents’ reasons: for\nit is possible that agents’ actions in deterministic worlds are\nnondeviantly caused by apt mental states and\nevents. Self-determination requires nondeterministic\ncausation, in a nondeviant way, by an agent’s reasons. While\nhistorically many have thought that nondeterministic causation is\nimpossible (Hobbes 1654 [1999], 1656 [1999]; Hume 1740 [1978], 1748\n[1975]), with the advent of quantum physics and, from a very different\ndirection, an influential essay by G. E. M. Anscombe (1971), it is now\nwidely assumed that nondeterministic (or probabilistic) causation is\npossible. There are two importantly different ways to understand\nnondeterministic causation: as the causation of probability or as the\nprobability of causation (cf. Jacobs and O’Connor 2013). Under\nthe causation of probability model, a nondeterministic cause \\(C\\)\ncauses (or causally contributes to) the objective probability of the\noutcome’s occurring rather than the outcome itself. On this\naccount, \\(S\\)’s reasons do not cause his decision but there\nbeing a certain antecedent objective probability of its occurring, and\nthe decision itself is uncaused. On the competing probability of\ncausation model, a nondeterministic cause \\(C\\) causes the outcome of\na nondeterministic process. Given that \\(C\\) is a nondeterministic\ncause of the outcome, it was possible given the exact same past and\nlaws of nature that \\(C\\) not cause the outcome (perhaps because it\nwas possible that some other event cause some other outcome)—the\nprobability of this causal transaction’s occurring was less than\n\\(1\\). Given that event-causal libertarians maintain that\nself-determined actions, and thus free actions, must be caused, they\nare committed to the probability of causation model of\nnondeterministic causation (cf. Franklin 2018, 25–26). (We note\nthat Balaguer [2010] is skeptical of the above distinction, and it is\nthus unclear whether he should best be classified as a non-causal or\nevent-causal libertarian though see Balaguer [2014] for evidence that\nit is best to treat him as a non-causalist.) Consequently, according\nto event-causal libertarians, when an agent \\(S\\) self-determines his\nchoice \\(\\phi\\), then \\(S\\)’s reasons \\(r_1\\)\nnondeterministically cause (in a nondeviant way) \\(\\phi\\), and it was\npossible, given the past and laws, that \\(r_1\\) not have caused\n\\(\\phi\\), but rather some of \\(S\\)’s other reasons \\(r_2\\)\nnondeterministically caused (in a nondeviant way) a different action\n\\(\\psi\\). \n\nAgent-causal libertarians contend that the event-causal picture fails\nto capture self-determination, for it fails to accord the agent with a\npower to settle what she does. Pereboom offers a forceful\nstatement of this worry: \n\nOn an event-causal libertarian picture, the relevant causal conditions\nantecedent to the decision, i.e., the occurrence of certain\nagent-involving events, do not settle whether the decision will occur,\nbut only render the occurrence of the decision about \\(50\\%\\)\nprobable. In fact, because no occurrence of antecedent events settles\nwhether the decision will occur, and only antecedent events are\ncausally relevant,\nnothing settles whether the decision will occur. (Pereboom\n2014, 32; cf. Watson 1987, 1996; O’Connor 1993, 1996; Clarke\n2003, ch. 8; 2011; Griffith 2010; Shabo 2011, 2013; Steward 2012, ch.\n3; Schlosser 2014) \n\nOn the event-causal picture, the agent’s causal contribution to\nher actions is exhausted by the causal contribution of her reasons,\nand yet her reasons leave open which decisions she will make, and this\nseems insufficient for self-determination. \n\nBut what more must be added? Agent-causal libertarians maintain that\nself-determination requires that the agent herself play a\ncausal role over and above the causal role played by her reasons. Some\nagent-causal libertarians deny that an agent’s reasons play any\ndirect causal role in bringing about an agent’s self-determined\nactions (Chisholm 1966; O’Connor 2000, ch. 5; 2009a), whereas\nothers allow or even require that self-determined actions be caused in\npart by the agent’s reasons (Clarke 2003, ch. 9; Steward 2012,\nch. 3). But all agent-causal libertarians insist that exercises of the\npower of self-determination do not reduce to nondeterministic\ncausation by apt mental states: agent-causation does not reduce to\nevent-causation. \n\nAgent-causal libertarianism seems to capture an aspect of\nself-determination that neither the above compatibilists accounts nor\nevent-causal libertarian accounts capture. (Some compatibilists even\naccept this and try to incorporate agent-causation into a\ncompatibilist understanding of free will. See Markosian 1999, 2012;\nNelkin 2011.)  These accounts reduce the causal role of the self to\nstates and events to which the agent is not identical (even if he is\nidentified with them). But how can self-determination of my\nactions wholly reduce to determination of my actions by\nthings other than the self? Richard Taylor nicely expresses\nthis intuition: “If I believe that something not identical to\nmyself was the cause of my behavior—some event wholly external\nto myself, for instance, or even one internal to myself, such as a\nnerve impulse, volition, or whatnot—then I cannot regard the\nbehavior as being an act of mine, unless I further believed that I was\nthe cause of that external or internal event” (1974, 55;\ncf. Franklin 2016). \n\nDespite its powerful intuitive pull for some, many have argued that\nagent-causal libertarianism is obscure or even incoherent. The stock\nobjection used to be that the very idea of\nagent-causation—causation by agents that is not reducible to\ncausation by mental states and events involving the agent—is\nincoherent, but this objection has become less common due to\npioneering work by Chisholm (1966, 1976), Taylor (1974),\nO’Connor (1995a, 2000, 2005, 2009a), and Clarke (1993, 1996,\n2003) (for helpful critical discussions of these worries see Clarke\n2003, ch. 10; O’Connor 2011; and Steward 2012, ch. 8). More\ncommon objections now concern, first, how to understand the\nrelationship between agent-causation and an agent’s reasons (or\nmotivations in general), and, second, the empirical adequacy of\nagent-causal libertarianism. With respect to the first worry, it is\nwidely assumed that the only (or at least best) way to understand\nreasons-explanation and motivational influence is within a causal\naccount of reasons, where reasons cause our actions (Davidson 1963;\nMele 1992). If agent-causal libertarians accept that self-determined\nactions, in addition to being agent-caused, must also be caused by\nagents’ reasons that favored those actions, then agent-causal\nlibertarians need to explain how to integrate these causes (for a\nsophisticated attempt to do just this, see Clarke 2003, ch. 8).  Given\nthat these two causes seem distinct, is it not possible that the agent\ncause his decision to \\(\\phi\\) and yet the agent’s reasons\nsimultaneously cause an incompatible decision to \\(\\psi\\)? If\nagent-causal libertarians side-step this difficult question by denying\nthat reasons cause action, then they must explain how reasons can\nexplain and motivate action without causing it; and this has turned\nout to be no easy task (but for a sophisticated attempt to do just\nthis, see O’Connor 2000, 2009a; for more general attempts to\nunderstand reasons-explanation and motivation within a non-causal\nframework see Schueler 1995, 2003; Sehon 2005). For further discussion\n see the entry on\n incompatibilist (nondeterministic) theories of free will.\n  \n\nFinally, we note that some recent philosophers have questioned the\npresumed difference between event- and agent-causation by arguing that\nall causation is object or substance causation. They argue\nthat the dominant tendency to understand ‘garden variety’\ncausal transactions in the world as relations between events is an\nunfortunate legacy of David Hume’s rejection of substance and\ncausation as basic metaphysical categories. On the competing\nmetaphysical picture of the world, the event or state of an\nobject’s having some property such as mass is its having a\ncausal power, which in suitable circumstances it exercises to bring\nabout a characteristic effect. Applied to human agents in an account\nof free will, the account suggests a picture on which an agent’s\nhaving desires, beliefs, and intentions are rational powers to will\nparticular courses of action, and where the agent’s willing is\nnot determined in any one direction, she wills freely. An advantage\nfor the agent-causalist who embraces this broader metaphysics is\n‘ideological’ parsimony. For different developments and\ndefenses of this approach, see Lowe (2008), Swinburne (2013), and\nJacobs and O’Connor (2013). \n\nMost philosophers theorizing about free will take themselves to be\nattempting to analyze a near-universal power of mature human beings.\nBut as we’ve noted above, there have been free will skeptics in\nboth ancient and (especially) modern times. (Israel 2001 highlights a\nnumber of such skeptics in the early modern period.) In this section,\nwe summarize the main lines of argument both for and against the\nreality of human freedom of will. \n\nThere are both a priori and empirical arguments against free will (See\n the entry on \n skepticism about moral responsibility).\n Several of these start with an argument that free will is incompatible\nwith causal determinism, which we will not rehearse here. Instead, we\nfocus on arguments that human beings lack free will, against the\nbackground assumption that freedom and causal determinism are\nincompatible. \n\nThe most radical a priori argument is that free will is not merely\ncontingently absent but is impossible. In recent decades, this\nargument is most associated with Galen Strawson (1986, ch. 2; 1994,\n2002). Strawson associates free will with being ‘ultimately\nmorally responsible’ for one’s actions. He argues that,\nbecause how one acts is a result of, or explained by, “how one\nis, mentally speaking” (\\(M\\)), for one to be responsible for\nthat choice one must be responsible for \\(M\\). To be responsible for\n\\(M\\), one must have chosen to be \\(M\\) itself—and that not\nblindly, but deliberately, in accordance with some reasons\n\\(r_1\\). But for that choice to be a responsible one, one must have\nchosen to be such as to be moved by \\(r_1\\), requiring some further\nreasons \\(r_2\\) for such a choice. And so on, ad\ninfinitum. Free choice requires an impossible infinite regress of\nchoices to be the way one is in making choices. \n\nThere have been numerous replies to Strawson’s argument. Mele\n(1995, 221ff.) argues that Strawson misconstrues the locus of freedom\nand responsibility. Freedom is principally a feature of our actions,\nand only derivatively of our characters from which such actions\nspring.  The task of the theorist is to show how one is in rational,\nreflective control of the choices one makes, consistent with there\nbeing no freedom-negating conditions. While this seems right, when\nconsidering those theories that make one’s free control to\nreside directly in the causal efficacy of one’s reasons (such as\ncompatibilist reasons-responsive accounts or event-causal\nlibertarianism), it is not beside the point to reflect on how one came\nto be that way in the first place and to worry that such reflection\nshould lead one to conclude that true responsibility (and hence\nfreedom) is undermined, since a complete distal source of any action\nmay be found external to the agent. Clarke (2003, 170–76) argues\nthat an effective reply may be made by indeterminists, and, in\nparticular, by nondeterministic agent-causal theorists. Such theorists\ncontend that (i) aspects of ‘how one is, mentally\nspeaking’, fully explain an agent’s choice\nwithout causally determining it and (ii) the agent himself causes the\nchoice that is made (so that the agent’s antecedent state, while\ngrounding an explanation of the action, is not the complete causal\nsource of it). Since the agent’s exercise of this power is\ncausally undetermined, it is not true that there is a sufficient\n‘ultimate’ source of it external to the agent.  Finally,\nMele (2006, 129–34, and 2017, 212–16) and O’Connor\n(2005, 2009b) suggest that freedom and moral responsibility come in\ndegrees and grow over time, reflecting the fact that ‘how one\nis, mentally speaking’ is increasingly shaped by one’s own\npast choices. Furthermore, some choices for a given individual may\nreflect more freedom and responsibility than others, which may be the\nkernel of truth behind Strawson’s sweeping argument. (For\ndiscussion of the ways that nature, nurture, and contingent\ncircumstances shape our behavior and raise deep issues concerning\nthe extent of our freedom and responsibility, see Levy 2011\nand Russell 2017, chs. 10–12.) \n\nA second family of arguments against free will contend that, in one\nway or another, nondeterministic theories of freedom entail either\nthat agents lack control over their choices or that the choices cannot\nbe adequately explained. These arguments are variously called the\n‘Mind’, ‘Rollback’, or ‘Luck’\nargument, with the latter admitting of several versions. (For\nstatements of such arguments, see van Inwagen 1983, ch. 4; 2000; Haji\n2001; Mele 2006; Shabo 2011, 2013, forthcoming; Coffman 2015). We note\nthat some philosophers advance such arguments not as parts of a\ngeneral case against free will, but merely as showing the inadequacy\nof specific accounts of free will [see, e.g., Griffith 2010].) They\neach describe imagined cases—individual cases, or comparison of\nintra- or inter-world duplicate antecedent conditions followed by\ndiverging outcomes—designed to elicit the judgment that the\noccurrence of a choice that had remained unsettled given all\nprior causal factors can only be a ‘matter of chance’,\n‘random’, or ‘a matter of luck’. Such terms\nhave been imported from other contexts and have come to function as\nquasi-technical, unanalyzed concepts in these debates, and it is\nperhaps more helpful to avoid such proxies and to conduct the debates\ndirectly in terms of the metaphysical notion of control and epistemic\nnotion of explanation. Where the arguments question whether an\nundetermined agent can exercise appropriate control over the choice he\nmakes, proponents of nondeterministic theories often reply that\ncontrol is not exercised prior to, but at the time of the\nchoice—in the very act of bringing it about (see, e.g., Clarke\n2005 and O’Connor 2007). Where the arguments question whether\nundetermined choices can be adequately explained, the reply often\nconsists in identifying a form of explanation other than the form\ndemanded by the critic—a ‘noncontrastive’\nexplanation, perhaps, rather than a ‘contrastive’\nexplanation, or a species of contrastive explanation consistent with\nindeterminism (see, e.g., Kane 1999; O’Connor 2000, ch. 5;\nClarke, 2003, ch. 8; and Franklin 2011a; 2018, ch. 5). \n\nWe now consider empirical arguments against human freedom. Some of\nthese stem from the physical sciences (while making assumptions\nconcerning the way physical phenomena fix psychological phenomena) and\nothers from neuroscience and psychology. \n\nIt used to be common for philosophers to argue that there is empirical\nreason to believe that the world in general is causally determined,\nand since human beings are parts of the world, they are too. Many took\nthis to be strongly confirmed by the spectacular success of Isaac\nNewton’s framework for understanding the universe as governed\neverywhere by fairly simple, exceptionless laws of motion. But the\nquantum revolution of the early twentieth century has made that\n‘clockwork universe’ image at least doubtful at the level\nof basic physics. While quantum mechanics has proven spectacularly\nsuccessful as a framework for making precise and accurate predictions\nof certain observable phenomena, its implications for the causal\nstructure of reality is still not well understood, and there are\n competing indeterministic and deterministic interpretations. See the\n entry on\n quantum mechanics \n for detailed discussion.) It is possible that\nindeterminacy on the small-scale, supposing it to be genuine,\n‘cancels out’ at the macroscopic scale of birds and\nbuildings and people, so that behavior at this scale is virtually\ndeterministic. But this idea, once common, is now being challenged\nempirically, even at the level of basic biology. Furthermore, the\nsocial, biological, and medical sciences, too, are rife with merely\nstatistical generalizations. Plainly, the jury is out on all these\ninter-theoretic questions. But that is just a way to say that current\nscience does not decisively support the idea that everything\nwe do is pre-determined by the past, and ultimately by the distant\npast, wholly out of our control. For discussion, see Balaguer (2009),\nKoch (2009), Roskies (2014), Ellis (2016). \n\nMaybe, then, we are subject to myriad causal influences, but the sum\ntotal of these influences doesn’t determine what we do, they\nonly make it more or less likely that we’ll do this or that. Now\nsome of the a priori no-free-will arguments above center on\nnondeterministic theories according to which there are objective\nantecedent probabilities associated with each possible choice\noutcome. Why objective probabilities of this kind might present\nspecial problems beyond those posed by the absence of determinism has\nbeen insufficiently explored to date. (For brief discussion, see\nVicens 2016 and O’Connor 2016.) But one philosopher who argues\nthat there is reason to hold that our actions, if undetermined, are\ngoverned by objective probabilities and that this fact calls into\nquestion whether we act freely is Derk Pereboom (2001, ch. 3; 2014,\nch. 3). Pereboom notes that our best physical theories indicate that\nstatistical laws govern isolated, small-scale physical events, and he\ninfers from the thesis that human beings are wholly physically\ncomposed that such statistical laws will also govern all the physical\ncomponents of human actions. Finally, Pereboom maintains that\nagent-causal libertarianism offers the correct analysis of free\nwill. He then invites us to imagine that the antecedent probability of\nsome physical component of an action occurring is \\(0.32\\). If the action\nis free while not violating the statistical law, then, in a scenario\nwith a large enough number of instances, this action would have to be\nfreely chosen close to \\(32\\) percent of the time. This leads to the\nproblem of “wild coincidences”: \n\nif the occurrence of these physical components were settled by the\nchoices of agent-causes, then their actually being chosen close to 32\npercent of the time would amount to a coincidence no less wild than\nthe coincidence of possible actions whose physical components have an\nantecedent probability of about 0.99 being chosen, over large enough\nnumber of instances, close to 99 percent of the time. The proposal\nthat agent-caused free choices do not diverge from what the\nstatistical laws predict for the physical components of our actions\nwould run so sharply counter to what we would expect as to make it\nincredible. (2014, 67) \n\nClarke (2010) questions the implicit assumption that free agent-causal\nchoices should be expected not to conform to physical\nstatistical laws, while O’Connor (2009a) challenges the more\ngeneral assumption that freedom requires that agent-causal choices not\nbe governed by statistical laws of any kind, as they plausibly would\nbe if the relevant psychological states/powers are strongly emergent\nfrom physical states of the human brain. \n\nPereboom’s empirical basis for free will skepticism is very\ngeneral. Others see support for free will skepticism from specific\nfindings and theories in the human sciences. They point to evidence\nthat we can be unconsciously influenced in the choices we make by a\nrange of factors, including ones that are not motivationally relevant;\nthat we can come to believe that we chose to initiate a behavior that\nin fact was artificially induced; that people subject to certain\nneurological disorders will sometimes engage in purposive behavior\nwhile sincerely believing that they are not directing them. Finally, a\ngreat deal of attention has been given to the work of neuroscientist\nBenjamin Libet (2002). Libet conducted some simple experiments that\nseemed to reveal the existence of ‘preparatory’ brain\nactivity shortly before a subject engages in an ostensibly spontaneous\naction. (Libet interpreted this activity as the brain’s\n‘deciding’ what to do before we are consciously settled on\na course of action.) Wegner (2001) surveys all of these findings (some\nof which are due to his own work as a social psychologist) and argues\non their basis that the experience of conscious willing is ‘an\nillusion’. For criticism of such arguments, see Mele (2009),\nO’Connor (2009c), and Nahmias (2014). \n\nWhile Pereboom and others point to these empirical considerations in\ndefense of free will skepticism, other philosophers see them as\nreasons to favor a more modest free will agnosticism (Kearns 2015) or\nto promote revisionism about the ‘folk idea of free will’\n(Vargas 2013; Nichols 2015). \n\nIf one is a compatibilist, then a case for the reality of free will\nrequires evidence for our being effective agents who for the most part\nare aware of what we do and why we are doing it. If one is an\nincompatibilist, then the case requires in addition evidence\nfor causal indeterminism, occurring in the right locations in the\nprocess leading from deliberation to action. Many think that we\nalready have third-personal ‘neutral’ scientific evidence\nfor much of human behavior’s satisfying modest compatibilist\nrequirements, such as Fischer and Ravizza’s\nreasons-responsiveness account. However, given the immaturity of\nsocial science and the controversy over whether psychological states\n‘reduce’ in some sense to underlying physical states (and\nwhat this might entail for the reality of mental causation), this\nclaim is doubtful. A more promising case for our satisfying (at least)\ncompatibilist requirements on freedom is that effective agency\nis presupposed by all scientific inquiry and so cannot\nrationally be doubted (which fact is overlooked by some of the more\nextreme ‘willusionists’ such as Wegner). \n\nHowever, effective intervention in the world (in scientific practice\nand elsewhere) does not (obviously) require that our behavior be\ncausally undetermined, so the ‘freedom is rationally\npresupposed’ argument cannot be launched for such an\nunderstanding of freedom. Instead, incompatibilists usually give one\nof the following two bases for rational belief in freedom (both of\nwhich can be given by compatibilists, too). \n\nFirst, philosophers have long claimed that we have introspective\nevidence of freedom in our experience of action, or perhaps of\nconsciously attended or deliberated action. Augustine and Scotus,\ndiscussed earlier, are two examples among many. In recent years,\nphilosophers have been more carefully scrutinizing the experience of\nagency and a debate has emerged concerning its contents, and in\nparticular whether it supports an indeterministic theory of human free\naction. For discussion, see Deery et al. (2013), Guillon (2014), Horgan\n(2015), and Bayne (2017). \n\nSecond, philosophers (e.g., Reid 1788 [1969], Swinburne 2013)\nsometimes claim that our belief in the reality of free will is\nepistemically basic, or reasonable without requiring independent\nevidential support. Most philosophers hold that some beliefs have that\nstatus, on pain of our having no justified beliefs whatever. It is\ncontroversial, however, just which beliefs do because it is\ncontroversial which criteria a belief must satisfy to qualify for that\nprivileged status. It is perhaps necessary that a basic belief be\n‘instinctive’ (unreflectively held) for all or most human\nbeings; that it be embedded in regular experience; and that it be\ncentral to our understanding of an important aspect of the world. Our\nbelief in free will seems to meet these criteria, but whether they are\nsufficient will be debated. Other philosophers defend a variation on\nthis stance, maintaining instead that belief in the reality of moral\nresponsibility is epistemically basic, and that since moral\nresponsibility entails free will, or so it is claimed, we may\ninfer the reality of free will (see, e.g., van Inwagen 1983,\n206–13). \n\nA large portion of Western philosophical work on free will has been\nwritten within an overarching theological framework, according to\nwhich God is the ultimate source, sustainer, and end of all else. Some\nof these thinkers draw the conclusion that God must be a sufficient,\nwholly determining cause for everything that happens; all of them\nsuppose that every creaturely act necessarily depends on the\nexplanatorily prior, cooperative activity of God. It is also commonly\npresumed by philosophical theists that human beings are free and\nresponsible (on pain of attributing evil in the world to God alone,\nand so impugning His perfect goodness). Hence, those who believe that\nGod is omni-determining typically are compatibilists with respect to\nfreedom and (in this case) theological determinism. Edwards (1754\n[1957]) is a good example. But those who suppose that God’s\nsustaining activity (and special activity of conferring grace) is only\na necessary condition on the outcome of human free choices need to\ntell a more subtle story, on which omnipotent God’s cooperative\nactivity can be (explanatorily) prior to a human choice and yet the\noutcome of that choice be settled only by the choice itself. For\nimportant medieval discussions—the apex of philosophical\nreflection on theological concerns—see the relevant portions of\nAl-Ghazali IP, Aquinas BW and Scotus QAM.\nThree positions (given in order of logical strength) on God’s\nactivity vis-à-vis creaturely activity were variously defended\nby thinkers of this area: mere conservationism, concurrentism, and\noccasionalism. These positions turn on subtle distinctions, which have\nrecently been explored by Freddoso (1988), Kvanvig and McCann (1991),\nGrant (2016), and Judisch (2016). \n\nMany suppose that there is a challenge to human freedom stemming not\nonly from God’s perfect power but also from his perfect\nknowledge. A standard argument for the incompatibility of free will\nand causal determinism has a close theological analogue. Recall van\nInwagen’s influential formulation of the ‘Consequence\nArgument’: \n\nIf determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws\nof nature and events in the remote past. But it is not up to us what\nwent on before we were born, and neither is it up to us what the laws\nof nature are. Therefore, the consequences of these things (including\nour present acts) are not up to us. (van Inwagen 1983, 16) \n\nAnd now consider an argument that turns on God’s comprehensive\nand infallible knowledge of the future: \nIf infallible divine foreknowledge is true, then our acts are the\n(logical) consequences of God’s beliefs in the remote past.\n(Since God cannot get things wrong, his believing that\nsomething will be so entails that it will be so.) But it is not up to\nus what beliefs God had before we were born, and neither is it up to\nus that God’s beliefs are necessarily true. Therefore, the\nconsequences of these things (including our present acts) are not up\nto us. \n\nAn excellent discussion of these arguments in tandem and attempts to\npoint to relevant disanalogies between causal determinism and\ninfallible foreknowledge may be found in the introduction to Fischer\n(1989). See also the entry on\n foreknowledge and free will.\n  \n\nAnother issue concerns how knowledge of God, the ultimate Good, would\nimpact human freedom. Many philosophical theologians, especially the\nmedieval Aristotelians, were drawn to the idea that human beings\ncannot but will that which they take to be an unqualified good. (As\nnoted above, Duns Scotus is an exception to this consensus, as were\nOckham and Suarez subsequently, but their dissent is limited.) Hence,\nif there is an afterlife, in which humans ‘see God face to\nface,’ they will inevitably be drawn to Him. Following\nPascal, Murray (1993, 2002) argues that a good God would choose to\nmake His existence and character less than certain for human beings,\nfor the sake of preserving their freedom. (He will do so, the argument\ngoes, at least for a period of time in which human beings participate\nin their own character formation.) If it is a good for human beings\nthat they freely choose to respond in love to God and to act in\nobedience to His will, then God must maintain an ‘epistemic\ndistance’ from them lest they be overwhelmed by His goodness or\npower and respond out of necessity, rather than freedom. (See also the\nother essays in Howard-Snyder and Moser 2002.) \n\nIf it is true that God withholds our ability to be certain of his\nexistence for the sake of our freedom, then it is natural to conclude\nthat humans will lack freedom in heaven. And it is anyways common to\ntraditional Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theologies to maintain that\nhumans cannot sin in heaven. Even so, traditional Christian theology\nat least maintains that human persons in heaven are free. What sort of\nfreedom is in view here, and how does it relate to mundane freedom?\nTwo good recent discussions of these questions are Pawl and Timpe\n(2009) and Tamburro (2017). \n\nFinally, there is the question of the freedom of God himself.  Perfect\ngoodness is an essential, not acquired, attribute of God. God cannot\nlie or be in any way immoral in His dealings with His creatures\n(appearances notwithstanding). Unless we take the minority position on\nwhich this is a trivial claim, since whatever God does\ndefinitionally counts as good, this appears to be a\nsignificant, inner constraint on God’s freedom. Did we not\ncontemplate immediately above that human freedom would be curtailed by\nour having an unmistakable awareness of what is in fact the Good? And\nyet is it not passing strange to suppose that God should be less than\nperfectly free? \n\nOne suggested solution to this puzzle takes as its point of departure\nthe distinction noted in section 2.3 between the ability to do\notherwise and sourcehood, proposing that the core metaphysical feature\nof freedom is being the ultimate source, or originator, of one’s\nchoices. For human beings or any created persons who owe their\nexistence to factors outside themselves, the only way their acts of\nwill could find their ultimate origin in themselves is for such acts\nnot to be determined by their character and circumstances. For if all\nmy willings were wholly determined, then if we were to trace my causal\nhistory back far enough, we would ultimately arrive at external\nfactors that gave rise to me, with my particular genetic\ndispositions. My motives at the time would not be\nthe ultimate source of my willings, only the\nmost proximate ones. Only by there being less than\ndeterministic connections between external influences and choices,\nthen, is it be possible for me to be an ultimate source of my\nactivity, concerning which I may truly say, “the buck stops\nhere.” \n\nAs is generally the case, things are different on this point in the\ncase of God. As Anselm observed, even if God's character absolutely\nprecludes His performing certain actions in certain contexts, this\nwill not imply that some external factor is in any way a partial\norigin of His willings and refrainings from willing. Indeed, this\nwould not be so even if he were determined by character to\nwill everything which He wills. God’s nature owes its\nexistence to nothing. Thus, God would be the sole and ultimate source\nof His will even if He couldn’t will otherwise. \n\nWell, then, might God have willed otherwise in any respect?\nThe majority view in the history of philosophical theology is that He\nindeed could have. He might have chosen not to create anything at all.\nAnd given that He did create, He might have created any number of\nalternatives to what we observe. But there have been noteworthy\nthinkers who argued the contrary position, along with others who\nclearly felt the pull of the contrary position even while resisting\nit.  The most famous such thinker is Leibniz (1710 [1985]), who argued\nthat God, being both perfectly good and perfectly powerful, cannot\nfail to will the best possible world. Leibniz insisted that this is\nconsistent with saying that God is able to will otherwise, although\nhis defense of this last claim is notoriously difficult to make out\nsatisfactorily.  Many read Leibniz, malgré lui, as one\nwhose basic commitments imply that God could not have willed other\nthan He does in any respect. \n\nOne might challenge Leibniz’s reasoning on this point by\nquestioning the assumption that there is a uniquely best possible\nCreation (an option noted by Adams 1987, though he challenges instead\nLeibniz’s conclusion based on it). One way this could be is if\nthere is no well-ordering of worlds: some pairs of worlds are\nsufficiently different in kind that they are incommensurate with each\nother (neither is better than the other, nor are they equal) and no\nworld is better than either of them. Another way this could be is if\nthere is no upper limit on goodness of worlds: for every possible\nworld God might have created, there are others (infinitely many, in\nfact) which are better. If such is the case, one might argue, it is\nreasonable for God to arbitrarily choose which world to create from\namong those worlds exceeding some threshold value of overall\ngoodness. \n\nHowever, William Rowe (2004) has countered that the thesis that there\nis no upper limit on goodness of worlds has a very different\nconsequence: it shows that there could not be a morally perfect\nCreator! For suppose our world has an on-balance moral value of \\(n\\)\nand that God chose to create it despite being aware of possibilities\nhaving values higher than \\(n\\) that He was able to create. It seems\nwe can now imagine a morally better Creator: one having the same\noptions who chooses to create a better world. For critical replies to\nRowe, see Almeida (2008, ch. 1), O’Connor (2008), and Kray\n(2010). \n\nFinally, Norman Kretzmann (1997, 220–25) has argued in the\ncontext of Aquinas’s theological system that there is strong\npressure to say that God must have created something or other, though\nit may well have been open to Him to create any of a number of\ncontingent orders. The reason is that there is no plausible account of\nhow an absolutely perfect God might have a resistible\nmotivation—one consideration among other, competing\nconsiderations—for creating something rather than nothing. (It\nobviously cannot have to do with any sort of utility, for example.)\nThe best general understanding of God’s being motivated to\ncreate at all—one which in places Aquinas himself comes very\nclose to endorsing—is to see it as reflecting the fact that\nGod’s very being, which is goodness, necessarily diffuses\nitself. Perfect goodness will naturally communicate itself outwardly;\nGod who is perfect goodness will naturally create, generating a\ndependent reality that imperfectly reflects that goodness. Wainwright\n(1996) discusses a somewhat similar line of thought in the Puritan\nthinker Jonathan Edwards. Alexander Pruss (2016), however, raises\nsubstantial grounds for doubt concerning this line of thought.","contact.mail":"toconnor@indiana.edu","contact.domain":"indiana.edu"},{"date.published":"2002-01-07","date.changed":"2018-08-21","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/","author1":"Timothy O'Connor","author1.info":"http://christopherefranklin.weebly.com/","entry":"freewill","body.text":"\n\n\n\nThe term “free will” has emerged over the past two\nmillennia as the canonical designator for a significant kind of\ncontrol over one’s actions. Questions concerning the\nnature and existence of this kind of control (e.g., does it require\nand do we have the freedom to do otherwise or the power of\nself-determination?), and what its true significance is (is it\nnecessary for moral responsibility or human dignity?) have been taken\nup in every period of Western philosophy and by many of the most\nimportant philosophical figures, such as Plato, Aristotle, Augustine,\nAquinas, Descartes, and Kant. (We cannot undertake here a review of\nrelated discussions in other philosophical traditions. For a start,\nthe reader may consult Marchal and Wenzel 2017 and Chakrabarti 2017\nfor overviews of thought on free will, broadly construed, in Chinese\nand Indian philosophical traditions, respectively.) In this way, it\nshould be clear that disputes about free will ineluctably involve\ndisputes about metaphysics and ethics. In ferreting out the kind of\ncontrol involved in free will, we are forced to consider questions\nabout (among others) causation, laws of nature, time, substance,\nontological reduction vs emergence, the relationship of causal and\nreasons-based explanations, the nature of motivation and more\ngenerally of human persons. In assessing the significance of free\nwill, we are forced to consider questions about (among others)\nrightness and wrongness, good and evil, virtue and vice, blame and\npraise, reward and punishment, and desert. The topic of free will also\ngives rise to purely empirical questions that are beginning to be\nexplored in the human sciences: do we have it, and to what degree?\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is an overview of what follows. In Section 1, we\nacquaint the reader with some central historical contributions to our\nunderstanding of free will. (As nearly every major and minor figure\nhad something to say about it, we cannot begin to cover them all.) As\nwith contributions to many other foundational topics, these ideas are\nnot of ‘merely historical interest’: present-day\nphilosophers continue to find themselves drawn back to certain\nthinkers as they freshly engage their contemporaries. In Section\n2, we map the complex architecture of the contemporary discussion\nof the nature of free will by dividing it into five subtopics: its\nrelation to moral responsibility; the proper analysis of the freedom\nto do otherwise; a powerful, recent argument that the freedom to do\notherwise (at least in one important sense) is not necessary\nfor moral responsibility; ‘compatibilist’ accounts of\nsourcehood or self-determination; and ‘incompatibilist’ or\n‘libertarian’ accounts of source and\nself-determination. In Section 3, we consider arguments from\nexperience, a priori reflection, and various scientific findings and\ntheories for and against the thesis that human beings have free will,\nalong with the related question of whether it is reasonable to believe\nthat we have it. Finally, in Section 4, we survey the\nlong-debated questions involving free will that arise in classical\ntheistic metaphysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne finds scholarly debate on the ‘origin’ of the notion\nof free will in Western philosophy. (See, e.g., Dihle (1982) and, in\nresponse Frede (2011), with Dihle finding it in St. Augustine\n(354–430 CE) and Frede in the Stoic Epictetus\n(c. 55–c. 135 CE)). But this debate presupposes a fairly\nparticular and highly conceptualized concept of free will, with\nDihle’s later ‘origin’ reflecting his having a yet\nmore particular concept in view than Frede. If, instead, we look more\ngenerally for philosophical reflection on choice-directed control over\none’s own actions, then we find significant discussion in Plato\nand Aristotle (cf. Irwin 1992). Indeed, on this matter, as with so\nmany other major philosophical issues, Plato and Aristotle give\nimportantly different emphases that inform much subsequent\nthought. \n\nIn Book IV of The Republic, Plato posits rational, spirited,\nand appetitive aspects to the human soul. The wise person strives for\ninner ‘justice’, a condition in which each part of the\nsoul plays its proper role—reason as the guide, the spirited\nnature as the ally of reason, exhorting oneself to do what reason\ndeems proper, and the passions as subjugated to the determinations of\nreason. In the absence of justice, the individual is enslaved to the\npassions. Hence, freedom for Plato is a kind of self-mastery, attained\nby developing the virtues of wisdom, courage, and temperance,\nresulting in one’s liberation from the tyranny of base desires\nand acquisition of a more accurate understanding and resolute pursuit\nof the Good. \n\nWhile Aristotle shares with Plato a concern for cultivating virtues,\nhe gives greater theoretical attention to the role of choice in\ninitiating individual actions which, over time, result in habits, for\ngood or ill. In Book III of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle\nsays that, unlike nonrational agents, we have the power to do or not\nto do, and much of what we do is voluntary, such that its origin is\n‘in us’ and we are ‘aware of the particular\ncircumstances of the action’. Furthermore, mature humans make\nchoices after deliberating about different available means to our\nends, drawing on rational principles of action. Choose consistently\nwell (poorly), and a virtuous (vicious) character will form over time,\nand it is in our power to be either virtuous or vicious. \n\nA question that Aristotle seems to recognize, while not satisfactorily\nanswering, is whether the choice an individual makes on any given\noccasion is wholly determined by his internal state—perception\nof his circumstances and his relevant beliefs, desires, and general\ncharacter dispositions (wherever on the continuum between virtue and\nvice he may be)—and external circumstances. He says that\n“the man is the father of his actions as of\nchildren”—that is, a person’s character shapes how\nshe acts. One might worry that this seems to entail that the person\ncould not have done otherwise—at the moment of choice, she has\nno control over what her present character is—and so she is not\nresponsible for choosing as she does. Aristotle responds by contending\nthat her present character is partly a result of previous\nchoices she made. While this claim is plausible enough, it seems to\n‘pass the buck’, since ‘the man is the father’\nof those earlier choices and actions, too. \n\nWe note just a few contributions of the subsequent centuries of the\nHellenistic era. This period was dominated by debates between\nEpicureans, Stoics, and the Academic Skeptics, and as it concerned\nfreedom of the will, the debate centered on the place of determinism\nor of fate in governing human actions and lives. The Stoics and the\nEpicureans believed that all ordinary things, human souls included,\nare corporeal and governed by natural laws or principles. Stoics\nbelieved that all human choice and behavior was causally determined,\nbut held that this was compatible with our actions being ‘up to\nus’.  Chrysippus ably defended this position by contending that\nyour actions are ‘up to you’ when they come about\n‘through you’—when the determining factors of your\naction are not external circumstances compelling you to act as you do\nbut are instead your own choices grounded in your perception of the\noptions before you.  Hence, for moral responsibility, the issue is not\nwhether one’s choices are determined (they are) but in what\nmanner they are determined. Epicurus and his followers had a more\nmechanistic conception of bodily action than the Stoics. They held\nthat all things (human soul included) are constituted by atoms, whose\nlaw-governed behavior fixes the behavior of everything made of such\natoms. But they rejected determinism by supposing that atoms, though\nlaw-governed, are susceptible to slight ‘swerves’ or\ndepartures from the usual paths. Epicurus has often been understood as\nseeking to ground the freedom of human willings in such\nindeterministic swerves, but this is a matter of controversy. If this\nunderstanding of his aim is correct, how he thought that this scheme\nmight work in detail is not known. (What little we know about his\nviews in this matter stem chiefly from the account given in his\nfollower Lucretius’s six-book poem,\nOn the Nature of Things.) \n\nA final notable figure of this period was Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nthe most important Peripatetic commentator on Aristotle. In his On\nFate, Alexander sharply criticizes the positions of the\nStoics. He goes on to resolve the ambiguity in Aristotle on the\nquestion of the determining nature of character on individual choices\nby maintaining that, given all such shaping factors, it remains open\nto the person when she acts freely to do or not to do what she in fact\ndoes. Many scholars see Alexander as the first unambiguously\n‘libertarian’ theorist of the will (for more information\nabout such theories see section 2 below). \n\nAugustine (354–430) is the central bridge between the ancient\nand medieval eras of philosophy. His mature thinking about the will\nwas influenced by his early encounter with late classical Neoplatonist\nthought, which is then transformed by the theological views he\nembraces in his adult Christian conversion, famously recounted in his\nConfessions. In that work and in the earlier On the Free\nChoice of the Will, Augustine struggles to draw together into a\ncoherent whole the doctrines that creaturely misuse of freedom, not\nGod, is the source of evil in the world and that the human will has\nbeen corrupted through the ‘fall’ from grace of the\nearliest human beings, necessitating a salvation that is attained\nentirely through the actions of God, even as it requires,\nconstitutively, an individual’s willed response of faith. The\ndetails of Augustine’s positive account remain a matter of\ncontroversy. He clearly affirms that the will is by its nature a\nself-determining power—no powers external to it determine its\nchoice—and that this feature is the basis of its freedom. But he\ndoes not explicitly rule out the will’s being internally\ndetermined by psychological factors, as Chrysippus held, and Augustine\nhad theological reasons that might favor (as well as others that would\noppose) the thesis that all things are determined in some manner by\nGod. Scholars divide on whether Augustine was a libertarian or instead\na kind of compatibilist with respect to metaphysical freedom. It is\nclear, however, that Augustine thought that we are powerfully shaped\nby wrongly-ordered desires that can make it impossible for us to\nwholeheartedly will ends contrary to those desires, for a\nsustained period of time. This condition entails an absence of\nsomething more valuable, ‘true freedom’, in which our wills\nare aligned with the Good, a freedom that can be attained only by a\ntransformative operation of divine grace. This latter, psychological\nconception of freedom of will clearly echoes Plato’s notion of\nthe soul’s (possible) inner justice. \n\nThomas Aquinas (1225–1274) attempted to synthesize major strands\nof Aristotle’s systematic philosophy with Christian theology,\nand so Aquinas begins his complex discussion of human action and\nchoice by agreeing with Aristotle that creatures such as ourselves who\nare endowed with both intellect and will are hardwired to will certain\ngeneral ends ordered to the most general goal of goodness. Will is\nrational desire: we cannot move towards that which does not\nappear to us at the time to be good. Freedom enters the picture when\nwe consider various means to these ends and move ourselves to activity\nin pursuit of certain of them. Our will is free in that it is not\nfixed by nature on any particular means, and they generally do not\nappear to us either as unqualifiedly good or as uniquely satisfying\nthe end we wish to fulfill. Furthermore, what appears to us to be good\ncan vary widely—even, over time, intra-personally. So much is\nconsistent with saying that in a given total circumstance (including\none’s present beliefs and desires), one is necessitated to will\nas one does.  For this reason, some commentators have taken Aquinas to\nbe a kind of compatibilist concerning freedom and causal or\ntheological determinism.  In his most extended defense of the thesis\nthat the will is not ‘compelled’ (DM 6), Aquinas\nnotes three ways that the will might reject an option it sees as\nattractive: (i) it finds another option more attractive, (ii) it comes\nto think of some circumstance rendering an alternative more favorable\n“by some chance circumstance, external or internal”, and\n(iii) the person is momentarily disposed to find an alternative\nattractive by virtue of a non-innate state that is subject to the will\n(e.g., being angry vs being at peace). The first consideration is\nclearly consistent with compatibilism. The second at best points to a\nkind of contingency that is not grounded in the activity of the will\nitself. And one wanting to read Aquinas as a libertarian might worry\nthat his third consideration just passes the buck: even if we do\nsometimes have an ability to directly modify perception-coloring\nstates such as moods, Aquinas’s account of will as rational\ndesire seems to indicate that we will do so only if it seems\nto us on balance to be good to do so. Those who read Aquinas as a\nlibertarian point to the following further remark in this text:\n“Will itself can interfere with the process [of some\ncause’s moving the will] either by refusing to consider what\nattracts it to will or by considering its opposite: namely, that there\nis a bad side to what is being proposed…” (Reply to 15;\nsee also DV 24.2). For discussion, see MacDonald (1998); and for\nthorough discussion of Aquinas’s theory of action, see Donagan\n(1985) and Stump (2003, ch. 9). \n\nJohn Duns Scotus (1265/66–1308) was the stoutest defender in the\nmedieval era of a strongly libertarian conception of the will,\nmaintaining on introspective grounds that will by its very nature is\nsuch that “nothing other than the will is the total cause”\nof its activity (QAM). Indeed, he held the unusual view that\nnot only up to but at the very instant that one is willing\n\\(X\\), it is possible for one to will \\(Y\\) or at least not to will\n\\(X\\). (He articulates this view through the puzzling claim that a\nsingle instant of time comprises two ‘instants of nature’,\nat the first but not the second of which alternative possibilities are\npreserved.) In opposition to Aquinas and other medieval Aristotelians,\nScotus maintained that a precondition of our freedom is that there are\ntwo fundamentally distinct ways things can seem good to us: as\npractically advantageous to us or as according with justice. Contrary\nto some popular accounts, however, Scotus allowed that the scope of\navailable alternatives for a person will be more or less\nconstricted. He grants that we are not capable of willing something in\nwhich we see no good whatsoever, nor of positively repudiating\nsomething which appears to us as unqualifiedly good. However, in\naccordance with his uncompromising position that nothing can be the\ntotal cause of the will other than itself, he held that where\nsomething does appear to us as unqualifiedly good (perfectly suited\nboth to our advantage and justice)—viz., in the ‘beatific\nvision’ of God in the afterlife—we still can refrain\nfrom willing it. \n\nThe problem of free will was an important topic in the modern period,\nwith all the major figures wading into it (Descartes 1641 [1988], 1644\n[1988]; Hobbes 1654 [1999], 1656 [1999]; Spinoza 1677 [1992]; Leibniz\n1686 [1991]; Locke 1690 [1975]; Hume 1740 [1978], 1748 [1975]; Edwards\n1754 [1957]; Kant 1781 [1998], 1785 [1998], 1788 [2015]; Reid 1788\n[1969]), and it continued to be widely discussed among early twentieth\ncentury philosophers (Moore 1912; Hobart 1934; Schlick 1939;\nNowell-Smith 1948, 1954; Campbell 1951; Ayer 1954; Smart 1961). The\ncentrality of the problem of free will to the various projects of\nearly modern philosophers can be traced to two widely, though not\nuniversally, shared assumptions. The first is that without belief in\nfree will, there would be little reason for us to act morally. More\ncarefully, it was widely assumed that belief in an afterlife in which\na just God rewards and punishes us according to our right or wrong use\nof free will was key to motivating us to be moral (Russell 2008,\nchs. 16–17). Life before death affords us many examples in which\nvice is better rewarded than virtue and so without knowledge of a\nfinal judgment in the afterlife, we would have little reason to pursue\nvirtue and justice when they depart from self-interest. And without\nfree will there can be no final judgement. \n\nThe second widely shared assumption is that free will seems difficult\nto reconcile with what we know about the world. While this assumption\nis shared by the majority of early modern philosophers, what\nspecifically it is about the world that seems to conflict with freedom\ndiffers from philosopher to philosopher. For some, the worry is\nprimarily theological. How can we make sense of contingency and\nfreedom in a world determined by a God who must choose the best\npossible world to create? For some, the worry was primarily\nmetaphysical. The principle of sufficient reason—roughly, the\nidea that every event must have a reason or cause—was a\ncornerstone of Descartes’s, Leibniz’s, and Spinoza’s\nmetaphysics. How does contingency and freedom fit into such a world?\nFor some, the worry was primarily scientific. Given that a proper\nunderstanding of the physical world is one in which all physical\nobjects are governed by deterministic laws of nature, how does\ncontingency and freedom fit into such a world? Of course, for some,\nall three worries were in play in their work (this is true especially\nof Descartes and Leibniz). \n\nDespite many disagreements about how best to solve these worries,\nthere were three claims that were widely, although not universally,\nagreed upon. The first was that free will has two aspects: the freedom\nto do otherwise and the power of self-determination. The second is\nthat an adequate account of free will must entail that free agents are\nmorally responsible agents and/or fit subjects for punishment. Ideas\nabout moral responsibility were often a yard stick by which analyses\nof free will were measured, with critics objecting to an analysis of\nfree will by arguing that agents who satisfied the analysis would not,\nintuitively, be morally responsible for their actions. The third is\nthat compatibilism—the thesis that free will is compatible with\ndeterminism—is true. (Spinoza, Reid, and Kant are the clear\nexceptions to this, though some also see Descartes as an\nincompatibilist [Ragland 2006].) \n\nSince a detailed discussion of these philosophers’ accounts of\nfree will would take us too far afield, we want instead to focus on\nisolating a two-step strategy for defending compatibilism that emerges\nin the early modern period and continued to exert considerable force\ninto the early twentieth century (and perhaps is still at work today).\nAdvocates of this two-step strategy have come to be known as\n“classical compatibilists”. The first step was to argue\nthat the contrary of freedom is not determinism but external\nconstraint on doing what one wants to do. For example, Hobbes contends\nthat liberty is “the absence of all the impediments to action\nthat are not contained in the nature and intrinsical quality of the\nagent” (Hobbes 1654 [1999], 38; cf. Hume 1748 [1975] VIII.1;\nEdwards 1754 [1957]; Ayer 1954). This idea led many compatibilists,\nespecially the more empiricist-inclined, to develop desire- or\npreference-based analyses of both the freedom to do otherwise and\nself-determination. An agent has the freedom to do otherwise than\n\\(\\phi\\) just in case if she\npreferred or willed to do otherwise, she would have\ndone otherwise (Hobbes 1654 [1999], 16; Locke 1690 [1975]) II.xx.8;\nHume 1748 [1975] VIII.1; Moore 1912; Ayer 1954). The freedom to do\notherwise does not require that you are able to act contrary to your\nstrongest motivation but simply that your action be dependent on your\nstrongest motivation in the sense that had you desired\nsomething else more strongly, then you would have pursued that\nalternative end. (We will discuss this analysis in more detail below in\nsection 2.2.) Similarly, an agent self-determines her \\(\\phi\\)-ing just in\ncase \\(\\phi\\) is caused by her strongest desires or\npreferences at the time of action (Hobbes 1654 [1999]; Locke\n1690 [1975]; Edwards 1754 [1957]). (We will discuss this analysis in\nmore detail below in section 2.4.) Given these analyses, determinism\nseems innocuous to freedom. \n\nThe second step was to argue that any attempt to analyze free will in\na way that putatively captures a deeper or more robust sense of\nfreedom leads to intractable conundrums. The most important examples\nof this attempt to capture a deeper sense of freedom in the modern\nperiod are Immanuel Kant (1781 [1998], 1785 [1998], 1788 [2015]) and\nThomas Reid (1788 [1969]) and in the early twentieth century\nC. A. Campbell (1951). These philosophers argued that the above\ncompatibilist analyses of the freedom to do otherwise and\nself-determination are, at best, insufficient for free will, and, at\nworst, incompatible with it. With respect to the classical\ncompatibilist analysis of the freedom to do otherwise, these critics\nargued that the freedom to do otherwise requires not just that an\nagent could have acted differently if he had willed\ndifferently, but also that he could have\nwilled differently. Free will requires more than free action.\nWith respect to classical compatibilists’ analysis of\nself-determination, they argued that self-determination requires that\nthe agent—rather than his desires, preferences, or any other\nmental state—cause his free choices and actions. Reid\nexplains: \n\nI consider the determination of the will as an effect. This effect\nmust have a cause which had the power to produce it; and the cause\nmust be either the person himself, whose will it is, or some other\nbeing…. If the person was the cause of that determination of\nhis own will, he was free in that action, and it is justly imputed to\nhim, whether it be good or bad. But, if another being was the cause of\nthis determination, either producing it immediately, or by means and\ninstruments under his direction, then the determination is the act and\ndeed of that being, and is solely imputed to him. (1788 [1969] IV.i,\n265) \n\nClassical compatibilists argued that both claims are incoherent.\nWhile it is intelligible to ask whether a man willed to do what he\ndid, it is incoherent to ask whether a man willed to will what he\ndid: \n\nFor to ask whether a man is at liberty to will either motion or rest,\nspeaking or silence, which he pleases, is to ask whether a man\ncan will what he wills, or be pleased with what he\nis pleased with? A question which, I think, needs no answer; and they\nwho make a question of it must suppose one will to determine the acts\nof another, and another to determine that, and so on in\ninfinitum. (Locke 1690 [1975] II.xx.25; cf. Hobbes 1656 [1999],\n72) \n\nIn response to libertarians’ claim that self-determination\nrequires that the agent, rather than his motives, cause his actions,\nit was objected that this removes the agent from the natural causal\norder, which is clearly unintelligible for human animals (Hobbes 1654\n[1999], 38). It is important to recognize that an implication of the\nsecond step of the strategy is that free will is not only compatible\nwith determinism but actually requires determinism (cf. Hume 1748\n[1975] VIII). This was a widely shared assumption among compatibilists\nup through the mid-twentieth century. \n\nSpinoza’s Ethics (1677 [1992]) is an important\ndeparture from the above dialectic. He endorses a strong form of\nnecessitarianism in which everything is categorically necessary\nopposed to the weaker form of conditional necessity embraced by most\ncompatibilists, and he contends that there is no room in such a world\nfor divine or creaturely free will. Thus, Spinoza is a free will\nskeptic. Interestingly, Spinoza is also keen to deny that the\nnonexistence of free will has the dire implications often assumed. As\nnoted above, many in the modern period saw belief in free will and an\nafterlife in which God rewards the just and punishes the wicked as\nnecessary to motivate us to act morally. According to Spinoza, so far\nfrom this being necessary to motivate us to be moral, it actually\ndistorts our pursuit of morality. True moral living, Spinoza thinks,\nsees virtue as its own reward (Part V, Prop. 42). Moreover, while free\nwill is a chimera, humans are still capable of freedom or\nself-determination. Such self-determination, which admits of degrees\non Spinoza’s view, arises when our emotions are determined by\ntrue ideas about the nature of reality. The emotional lives of the\nfree persons are ones in which “we desire nothing but that which\nmust be, nor, in an absolute sense, can we find contentment in\nanything but truth. And so in so far as we rightly understand these\nmatters, the endeavor of the better part of us is in harmony with the\norder of the whole of Nature” (Part IV, Appendix). Spinoza is an\nimportant forerunner to the many free will skeptics in the twentieth\ncentury, a position that continues to attract strong support (see\nStrawson 1986; Double 1992; Smilansky 2000; Pereboom 2001, 2014; Levy\n2011; Waller 2011; Caruso 2012; Vilhauer 2012. For further discussion\n see the entry\n skepticism about moral responsibility).  \n\nIt is worth observing that in many of these disputes about the nature\nof free will there is an underlying dispute about the nature of moral\nresponsibility. This is seen clearly in Hobbes (1654 [1999]) and early\ntwentieth century philosophers’ defense of compatibilism.\nUnderlying the belief that free will is incompatible with determinism\nis the thought that no one would be morally responsible for any\nactions in a deterministic world in the sense that no one would\ndeserve blame or punishment. Hobbes responded to this charge\nin part by endorsing broadly consequentialist justifications of blame and\npunishment: we are justified in blaming or punishing because these\npractices deter future harmful actions and/or contribute to reforming\nthe offender (1654 [1999], 24–25; cf. Schlick 1939; Nowell-Smith\n1948; Smart 1961). While many, perhaps even most, compatibilists have\ncome to reject this consequentialist approach to moral responsibility\nin the wake of P. F. Strawson’s 1962 landmark essay\n‘Freedom and Resentment’ (though see Vargas (2013) and\nMcGeer (2014) for contemporary defenses of compatibilism that appeal\nto forward-looking considerations) there is still a general lesson to\nbe learned: disputes about free will are often a function of\nunderlying disputes about the nature and value of moral\nresponsibility. \n\nAs should be clear from this short discussion of the history of the\nidea of free will, free will has traditionally been conceived of as a\nkind of power to control one’s choices and actions. When an\nagent exercises free will over her choices and actions, her choices\nand actions are up to her. But up to her in what sense? As\nshould be clear from our historical survey, two common (and\ncompatible) answers are: (i) up to her in the sense that she is able\nto choose otherwise, or at minimum that she is able not to choose or\nact as she does, and (ii) up to her in the sense that she is the\nsource of her action. However, there is widespread controversy both\nover whether each of these conditions is required for free will and if\nso, how to understand the kind or sense of freedom to do otherwise or\nsourcehood that is required. While some seek to resolve these\ncontroversies in part by careful articulation of our experiences of\ndeliberation, choice, and action (Nozick 1981, ch. 4; van Inwagen\n1983, ch. 1; O’Connor 2000, ch. 1), many seek to resolve these\ncontroversies by appealing to the nature of moral responsibility. The\nidea is that the kind of control or sense of up-to-meness involved in\nfree will is the kind of control or sense of up-to-meness relevant to\nmoral responsibility (Double 1992, 12; Ekstrom 2000, 7–8;\nSmilansky 2000, 16; Widerker and McKenna 2003, 2; Vargas 2007, 128;\nNelkin 2011, 151–52; Levy 2011, 1; Pereboom 2014,\n1–2). Indeed, some go so far as to define ‘free\nwill’ as ‘the strongest control condition—whatever\nthat turns out to be—necessary for moral responsibility’\n(Wolf 1990, 3–4; Fischer 1994, 3; Mele 2006, 17). Given this\nconnection, we can determine whether the freedom to do otherwise and\nthe power of self-determination are constitutive of free will and, if\nso, in what sense, by considering what it takes to be a morally\nresponsible agent. On these latter characterizations of free will,\nunderstanding free will is inextricably linked to, and perhaps even\nderivative from, understanding moral responsibility. And even those\nwho demur from this claim regarding conceptual priority typically see\na close link between these two ideas.  Consequently, to appreciate the\ncurrent debates surrounding the nature of free will, we need to say\nsomething about the nature of moral responsibility. \n\nIt is now widely accepted that there are different species of moral\nresponsibility. It is common (though not uncontroversial) to\ndistinguish moral responsibility as answerability from moral\nresponsibility as attributability from moral responsibility as\naccountability (Watson 1996; Fischer and Tognazzini 2011;\nShoemaker 2011. See Smith (2012) for a critique of this taxonomy).\nThese different species of moral responsibility differ along three\ndimensions: (i) the kind of responses licensed toward the responsible\nagent, (ii) the nature of the licensing relation, and (iii) the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for licensing the relevant kind of\nresponses toward the agent. For example, some argue that when an agent\nis morally responsible in the attributability sense, certain\njudgments about the agent—such as judgments concerning\nthe virtues and vices of the agent—are fitting, and that\nthe fittingness of such judgments does not depend on whether the agent\nin question possessed the freedom to do otherwise (cf. Watson\n1996). \n\nWhile keeping this controversy about the nature of moral\n responsibility firmly in mind (see the entry on\n moral responsibility\n for a\nmore detailed discussion of these issues), we think it is fair to say\nthat the most commonly assumed understanding of moral responsibility in\nthe historical and contemporary discussion of the problem of free will\nis moral responsibility as accountability in something like\nthe following sense: \n\nAn agent \\(S\\) is morally accountable for performing an action\n\\(\\phi\\) \\(=_{df.}\\) \\(S\\) deserves praise if \\(\\phi\\) goes beyond\nwhat can be reasonably expected of \\(S\\) and \\(S\\) deserves blame if\n\\(\\phi\\) is morally wrong. \n\nThe central notions in this definition are praise,\nblame, and desert. The majority of contemporary\nphilosophers have followed Strawson (1962) in contending that praising\nand blaming an agent consist in experiencing (or at least being\ndisposed to experience (cf. Wallace 1994, 70–71)) reactive\nattitudes or emotions directed toward the agent, such as gratitude,\napprobation, and pride in the case of praise, and resentment,\nindignation, and guilt in the case of blame. (See Sher (2006) and\n Scanlon (2008) for important dissensions from this trend. See\n the entry on blame\n for a more detailed discussion.) These emotions, in turn, dispose\nus to act in a variety of ways. For example, blame disposes us to\nrespond with some kind of hostility toward the blameworthy agent, such\nas verbal rebuke or partial withdrawal of good will. But while these\nkinds of dispositions are essential to our blaming someone, their\nmanifestation is not: it is possible to blame someone with very little\nchange in attitudes or actions toward the agent. Blaming someone might\nbe immediately followed by forgiveness as an end of the matter. \n\nBy ‘desert’, we have in mind what Derk Pereboom has\ncalled basic desert: \n\nThe desert at issue here is basic in the sense that the agent would\ndeserve to be blamed or praised just because she has performed the\naction, given an understanding of its moral status, and not, for\nexample, merely by virtue of consequentialist or contractualist\nconsiderations. (2014, 2) \n\nAs we understand desert, if an agent deserves blame, then we have a\nstrong pro tanto reason to blame him simply in virtue of his\nbeing accountable for doing wrong. Importantly, these reasons can be\noutweighed by other considerations. While an agent may deserve blame,\nit might, all things considered, be best to forgive him\nunconditionally instead. \n\nWhen an agent is morally responsible for doing something wrong, he is\nblameworthy: he deserves hard treatment marked by resentment\nand indignation and the actions these emotions dispose us toward, such\nas censure, rebuke, and ostracism. However, it would seem unfair to\ntreat agents in these ways unless their actions were up to\nthem. Thus, we arrive at the core connection between free will\nand moral responsibility: agents deserve praise or blame only if their\nactions are up to them—only if they have free\nwill. Consequently, we can assess analyses of free will by their\nimplications for judgments of moral responsibility. We note that some\nmight reject the claim that free will is necessary for moral\nresponsibility (e.g., Frankfurt 1971; Stump 1988), but even for these\ntheorists an adequate analysis of free will must specify\na sufficient condition for the kind of control at play in\nmoral responsibility. \n\nIn what follows, we focus our attention on the two most commonly cited\nfeatures of free will: the freedom to do otherwise and sourcehood.\nWhile some seem to think that free will consists exclusively in either\nthe freedom to do otherwise (van Inwagen 2008) or in sourcehood\n(Zagzebski 2000), we think that the majority of philosophers hold that\nfree will involves both conditions—though philosophers often\nemphasize one condition over the other depending on their dialectical\nsituation or argumentative purposes (cf. Watson 1987). In what\nfollows, we will describe the most common characterizations of these\ntwo conditions. \n\nFor most newcomers to the problem of free will, it will seem obvious\nthat an action is up to an agent only if she had the freedom to do\notherwise. But what does this freedom come to? The freedom to do\notherwise is clearly a modal property of agents, but it is\ncontroversial just what species of modality is at stake. It must be\nmore than mere possibility: to have the freedom to do\notherwise consists in more than the mere possibility of something\nelse’s happening. A more plausible and widely endorsed\nunderstanding claims the relevant modality is ability or\npower (Locke 1690 [1975], II.xx; Reid 1788 [1969],\nII.i–ii; D. Locke 1973; Clarke 2009; Vihvelin 2013). But\nabilities themselves seem to come in different varieties (Lewis 1976;\nHorgan 1979; van Inwagen 1983, ch. 1; Mele 2003; Clarke 2009; Vihvelin\n2013, ch. 1; Franklin 2015), so any claim that an agent has ‘the\nability to do otherwise’ is ambiguous or indeterminate unless\nthe sense of ability appealed to is spelled out. A satisfactory\naccount of the freedom to do otherwise owes us both an account of the\nkind of ability in terms of which the freedom to do otherwise is\nanalyzed, and an argument for why this kind of ability (as opposed to\nsome other species) is the one constitutive of the freedom to do\notherwise. As we will see, philosophers sometimes leave this second\ndebt unpaid. \n\nThe contemporary literature takes its cue from classical\ncompatibilism’s recognized failure to deliver a satisfactory\nanalysis of the freedom to do otherwise. As we saw above, classical\ncompatibilists (Hobbes 1654 [1999], 1656 [1999]; Locke 1690 [1975];\nHume 1740 [1978], 1748 [1975]; Edwards 1754 [1957]; Moore 1912;\nSchlick 1939; Ayer 1954) sought to analyze the freedom to do otherwise\nin terms of a simple conditional analysis of ability: \n\nSimple Conditional Analysis: An agent \\(S\\) has the\nability to do otherwise if and only if, were \\(S\\) to choose to do\notherwise, then \\(S\\) would do otherwise. \n\nPart of the attraction of this analysis is that it obviously\nreconciles the freedom to do otherwise with determinism. While the\ntruth of determinism entails that one’s action is inevitable\ngiven the past and laws of nature, there is nothing about determinism\nthat implies that if one had chosen otherwise, then one would\nnot do otherwise. \n\nThere are two problems with the Simple Conditional\nAnalysis. The first is that it is, at best, an analysis of\nfree action, not free will (cf. Reid 1788 [1969]; Chisholm 1966; 1976,\nch. 2; Lehrer 1968, 1976). It only tells us when an agent has the\nability to do otherwise, not when an agent has the ability to\nchoose to do otherwise. One might be tempted to think that\nthere is an easy fix along the following lines: \n\nSimple Conditional Analysis*: An agent \\(S\\) has the\nability to choose otherwise if and only if, were \\(S\\) to desire or\nprefer to choose otherwise, then \\(S\\) would choose otherwise. \n\nThe problem is that we often fail to choose to do things we want to\nchoose, even when it appears that we had the ability to choose\notherwise (one might think the same problem attends the original\nanalysis). Suppose that, in deciding how to spend my evening, I have a\ndesire to choose to read and a desire to choose to watch a movie.\nSuppose that I choose to read. By all appearances, I had the ability\nto choose to watch a movie. And yet, according to the Simple\nConditional Analysis*, I lack this freedom, since the\nconditional ‘if I were to desire to choose to watch a movie,\nthen I would choose to watch a movie’ is false. I do desire to\nchoose to watch a movie and yet I do not choose to watch a movie. It\nis unclear how to remedy this problem. On the one hand, we might\nrefine the antecedent by replacing ‘desire’ with\n‘strongest desire’ (cf. Hobbes 1654 [1999], 1656 [1999];\nEdwards 1754 [1957]). The problem is that this assumes, implausibly,\nthat we always choose what we most strongly desire (for criticisms of\nthis view see Reid 1788 [1969]; Campbell 1951; Wallace 1999; Holton\n2009). On the other hand, we might refine the consequent by replacing\n‘would choose to do otherwise’ with either ‘would\nprobably choose to do otherwise’ or ‘might choose to do\notherwise’.  But each of these proposals is also problematic. If\n‘probably’ means ‘more likely than not’, then\nthis revised conditional still seems too strong: it seems possible to\nhave the ability to choose otherwise even when one’s so choosing\nis unlikely. If we opt for ‘might’, then the relevant\nsense of modality needs to be spelled out. \n\nEven if there are fixes to these problems, there is a yet deeper\nproblem with these analyses. There are some agents who clearly lack\nthe freedom to do otherwise and yet satisfy the conditional at the\nheart of these analyses. That is, although these agents lack the\nfreedom to do otherwise, it is, for example, true of them\nthat if they chose otherwise, they would do\notherwise. Picking up on an argument developed by Keith Lehrer (1968;\ncf. Campbell 1951; Broad 1952; Chisholm 1966), consider an\nagoraphobic, Luke, who, when faced with the prospect of entering an\nopen space, is subject not merely to an irresistible desire to refrain\nfrom intentionally going outside, but an irresistible desire to\nrefrain from even choosing to go outside. Given Luke’s\npsychology, there is no possible world in which he suffers from his\nagoraphobia and chooses to go outside. It may well nevertheless be\ntrue that if Luke chose to go outside, then he would have\ngone outside. After all, any possible world in which he chooses to go\noutside will be a world in which he no longer suffers (to the same\ndegree) from his agoraphobia, and thus we have no reason to doubt that\nin those worlds he would go outside as a result of his choosing to go\noutside. The same kind of counterexample applies with equal force to\nthe conditional ‘if \\(S\\) desired to choose otherwise, then\n\\(S\\) would choose otherwise’. \n\nWhile simple conditional analyses admirably make clear the species of\nability to which they appeal, they fail to show that this species of\nability is constitutive of the freedom to do otherwise. Agents need a\nstronger ability to do otherwise than characterized by such simple\nconditionals. Some argue that the fundamental source of the above\nproblems is the conditional nature of these analyses\n(Campbell 1951; Austin 1961; Chisholm 1966; Lehrer 1976; van Inwagen\n1983, ch.  4). The sense of ability relevant to the freedom to do\notherwise is the ‘all-in sense’—that is, holding\neverything fixed up to the time of the decision or action—and\nthis sense, so it is argued, can only be captured by a categorical\nanalysis of the ability to do otherwise: \n\nCategorical Analysis: An agent \\(S\\) has the ability\nto choose or do otherwise than \\(\\phi\\) at time \\(t\\) if and only if\nit was possible, holding fixed everything up to \\(t\\), that \\(S\\)\nchoose or do otherwise than \\(\\phi\\) at \\(t\\). \n\nThis analysis gets the right verdict in Luke’s case. He lacks\nthe ability to do otherwise than refrain from choosing to go outside,\naccording to this analysis, because there is no possible world in\nwhich he suffers from his agoraphobia and yet chooses to go\noutside. Unlike the above conditional analyses,\nthe Categorical Analysis requires that we hold fixed\nLuke’s agoraphobia when considering alternative\npossibilities. \n\nIf the Categorical Analysis is correct, then free\nwill is incompatible with determinism. According to the thesis of\ndeterminism, all deterministic possible worlds with the same pasts and\nlaws of nature have the same futures (Lewis 1979; van Inwagen 1983,\n3). Suppose John is in deterministic world \\(W\\) and refrains from\nraising his hand at time \\(t\\). Since \\(W\\) is deterministic, it\nfollows that any possible world \\(W^*\\) that has the same past and\nlaws up to \\(t\\) must have the same future, including John’s\nrefraining from raising his hand at \\(t\\). Therefore, John lacked the\nability, and thus freedom, to raise his hand. \n\nThis argument, carefully articulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s\nby Carl Ginet (1966, 1990) and Peter van Inwagen (1975, 1983) and\nrefined in important ways by John Martin Fischer (1994), has come to\nbe known as the Consequence Argument. van Inwagen offers the following\ninformal statement of the argument: \n\nIf determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws\nof nature and events in the remote past. But it is not up to us what\nwent on before we were born [i.e., we do not have the ability to change \nthe past], and neither is it up to us what the laws of nature are [i.e., \nwe do not have the ability to break the laws of nature]. Therefore, the \nconsequences of these things (including our present acts) are not up to us. \n(van Inwagen 1983, 16; cf. Fischer 1994, ch. 1) \n\nLike the Simple Conditional Analysis, a virtue of\nthe Categorical Analysis is that it spells out\nclearly the kind of ability appealed to in its analysis of the freedom\nto do otherwise, but like the Simple Conditional\nAnalysis, critics have argued that the sense of ability it\ncaptures is not the sense at the heart of free will. The objection\nhere, though, is not that the analysis is too permissive or weak, but\nrather that it is too restrictive or strong. \n\nWhile there have been numerous different replies along these lines\n (e.g., Lehrer 1980; Slote 1982; Watson 1986. See the entry on\n arguments for incompatibilism\n for a more extensive discussion of and\nbibliography for the Consequence Argument), the most influential of\nthese objections is due to David Lewis (1981). Lewis contended that\nvan Inwagen’s argument equivocated on ‘is able to break a\nlaw of nature’. We can distinguish two senses of ‘is able\nto break a law of nature’: \n\n(Weak Thesis) I am able to do something such that, if I did it, a law\nof nature would be broken. \n\n(Strong Thesis) I am able to do something such that, if I did it, it\nwould constitute a law of nature’s being broken or would cause a\nlaw of nature to be broken. \n\nIf we are committed to the Categorical Analysis,\nthen those desiring to defend compatibilism seem to be committed to the sense of ability in ‘is able to break\na law of nature’ along the lines of the strong thesis. Lewis\nagrees with van Inwagen that it is “incredible” to think\nhumans have such an ability (Lewis 1981, 113), but maintains that\ncompatibilists need only appeal to the ability to break a law of nature\nin the weak sense. While it is absurd to think that humans are able to\ndo something that is a violation of a law of nature or\ncauses a law of nature to be broken, there is nothing\nincredible, so Lewis claimed, in thinking that humans are able to do\nsomething such that if they did it, a law of nature would be\nbroken. In essence, Lewis is arguing that incompatibilists like van\nInwagen have failed to adequately motivate the restrictiveness of the\nCategorical Analysis. \n\nSome incompatibilists have responded to Lewis by contending that even\nthe weak ability is incredible (O’Connor 2000, ch.1; van Inwagen\n2004). But there is a different and often overlooked problem for\nLewis: the weak ability seems to be too weak. Returning to the case of\nJohn’s refraining from raising his hand, Lewis maintains that\nthe following three propositions are consistent: \n\nOne might think that (ii) and (iii) are incompatible with (i).\nConsider again Luke, our agoraphobic. Suppose that his agoraphobia\naffects him in such a way that he will only intentionally go outside\nif he chooses to go outside, and yet his agoraphobia makes it\nimpossible for him to make this choice. In this case, a necessary\ncondition for Luke’s intentionally going outside is his choosing\nto go outside.  Moreover, Luke is not able to choose or cause himself\nto choose to go outside. Intuitively, this would seem to imply that\nLuke lacks the freedom to go outside. But this implication\ndoes not follow for Lewis. From the fact that Luke is able to go\noutside only if he chooses to go outside and the fact that Luke is not\nable to choose to go outside, it does not follow, on\nLewis’s account, that Luke lacks the ability to go\noutside. Consequently, Lewis’s account fails to explain why Luke\nlacks the ability to go outside (cf.  Speak 2011). (For other\nimportant criticisms of Lewis, see Ginet [1990, ch. 5] and Fischer\n[1994, ch. 4].) \n\nWhile Lewis may be right that the Categorical\nAnalysis is too restrictive, his argument, all by itself,\ndoesn’t seem to establish this. His argument is successful only\nif (a) he can provide an alternative analysis of ability that entails\nthat Luke’s agoraphobia robs him of the ability to go outside and\n(b) does not entail that determinism robs John of the ability to raise\nhis hand (cf. Pendergraft 2010). Lewis must point out a principled\ndifference between these two cases. As should be clear from the above,\nthe Simple Conditional Analysis is of no help.\nHowever, some recent work by Michael Smith (2003), Kadri Vihvelin\n(2004; 2013), and Michael Fara (2008) have attempted to fill this gap.\nWhat unites these theorists—whom Clarke (2009) has called the\n‘new dispositionalists’—is their attempt to appeal to\nrecent advances in the metaphysics of dispositions to arrive at a\nrevised conditional analysis of the freedom to do otherwise. The most\nperspicuous of these accounts is offered by Vihvelin (2004), who argues\nthat an agent’s having the ability to do otherwise is solely a\nfunction of the agent’s intrinsic properties. (It is important to\nnote that Vihvelin [2013] has come to reject the view that free will\nconsists exclusively in the kind of ability analyzed below.) Building\non Lewis’s work on the metaphysics of dispositions, she arrives\nat the following analysis of ability: \n\nRevised Conditional Analysis of Ability: \\(S\\) has\nthe ability at time \\(t\\) to do \\(X\\) iff, for some intrinsic property\nor set of properties \\(B\\) that \\(S\\) has at \\(t\\), for some time\n\\(t'\\) after \\(t\\), if \\(S\\) chose (decided, intended, or tried) at\n\\(t\\) to do \\(X\\), and \\(S\\) were to retain \\(B\\) until \\(t'\\),\n\\(S\\)’s choosing (deciding, intending, or trying) to do \\(X\\)\nand \\(S\\)’s having \\(B\\) would jointly be an \\(S\\)-complete\ncause of \\(S\\)’s doing \\(X\\). (Vihvelin 2004, 438) \n\nLewis defines an ‘\\(S\\)-complete cause’ as “a cause\ncomplete insofar as havings of properties intrinsic to [\\(S\\)] are\nconcerned, though perhaps omitting some events extrinsic to\n[\\(S\\)]” (cf. Lewis 1997, 156). In other words, an\n\\(S\\)-complete cause of \\(S\\)’s doing \\(\\phi\\) requires that\n\\(S\\) possess all the intrinsic properties relevant to \\(S\\)’s\ncausing \\(S\\)’s doing \\(\\phi\\). This analysis appears to afford\nVihvelin the basis for a principled difference between agoraphobics\nand merely determined agents. We must hold fixed an agent’s\nphobias since they are intrinsic properties of agents, but we need not\nhold fixed the laws of nature because these are not intrinsic\nproperties of agents. (It should be noted that the assumption that\nintrinsic properties are wholly separable from the laws of nature is\n disputed by ‘dispositional essentialists.’ See the entry on\n metaphysics of causation.)\n Vihvelin’s analysis appears to be restrictive enough to\nexclude phobics from having the freedom to do otherwise, but\npermissive enough to allow that some agents in deterministic worlds\nhave the freedom to do otherwise. \n\nBut appearances can be deceiving. The new dispositionalist claims\nhave received some serious criticism, with the majority of the\ncriticisms maintaining that these analyses are still too permissive\n(Clarke 2009; Whittle 2010; Franklin 2011b). For example, Randolph\nClarke argues that Vihvelin’s analysis fails to overcome the\noriginal problem with the Simple Conditional Analysis.\nHe writes, “A phobic agent might, on some occasion, be unable to\nchoose to A and unable to A without so choosing,\nwhile retaining all that she would need to implement such a choice,\nshould she make it. Despite lacking the ability to choose to\nA, the agent might have some set of intrinsic properties\nB such that, if she chose to A and retained\nB, then her choosing to A and her having B\nwould jointly be an agent-complete cause of her A-ing”\n(Clarke 2009, p. 329). \n\nThe Categorical Analysis, and thus incompatibilism\nabout free will and determinism, remains an attractive option for many\nphilosophers precisely because it seems that compatibilists have yet to\nfurnish an analysis of the freedom to do otherwise that implies that\nphobics clearly lack the ability to choose or do otherwise that is\nrelevant to moral responsibility and yet some merely determined agents\nhave this ability. \n\nSome have tried to avoid these lingering problems for compatibilists\nby arguing that the freedom to do otherwise is not required for free\nwill or moral responsibility. What matters for an agent’s\nfreedom and responsibility, so it is argued, is the source of\nher action—how her action was brought about. The most prominent\nstrategy for defending this move appeals to ‘Frankfurt-style\ncases’. In a ground-breaking piece, Harry Frankfurt (1969)\npresented a series of thought experiments intended to show that it is\npossible that agents are morally responsible for their actions and yet\nthey lack the ability to do otherwise. While Frankfurt (1971) took\nthis to show that moral responsibility and free will come\napart—free will requires the ability to do otherwise but moral\nresponsibility does not—if we define ‘free will’ as\n‘the strongest control condition required for moral\nresponsibility’ (cf. Wolf 1990, 3–4; Fischer 1994, 3; Mele\n2006, 17), then if Frankfurt-style cases show that moral\nresponsibility does not require the ability to do otherwise, then they\nalso show that free will does not require the ability to do\notherwise. Let us consider this challenge in more detail. \n\nHere is a representative Frankfurt-style case: \n\nImagine, if you will, that Black is a quite nifty (and even generally\nnice) neurosurgeon. But in performing an operation on Jones to remove\na brain tumor, Black inserts a mechanism into Jones’s brain\nwhich enables Black to monitor and control Jones’s\nactivities. Jones, meanwhile, knows nothing of this. Black exercises\nthis control through a sophisticated computer which he has programmed\nso that, among other things, it monitors Jones’s voting\nbehavior.  If Jones were to show any inclination to vote for Bush,\nthen the computer, through the mechanism in Jones’s brain,\nintervenes to ensure that he actually decides to vote for Clinton and\ndoes so vote.  But if Jones decides on his own to vote for Clinton,\nthe computer does nothing but continue to monitor—without\naffecting—the goings-on in Jones’s head. (Fischer 2006,\n38) \n\nFischer goes on to suppose that Jones “decides to vote for\nClinton on his own”, without any interference from Black, and\nmaintains that in such a case Jones is morally responsible for his\ndecision. Fischer draws two interrelated conclusions from this case.\nThe first, negative conclusion, is that the ability to do otherwise is\nnot necessary for moral responsibility. Jones is unable to refrain\nfrom deciding to vote for Clinton, and yet, so long as Jones decides\nto vote for Clinton on his own, his decision is free and one for which\nhe is morally responsible. The second, positive conclusion, is that\nfreedom and responsibility are functions of the\nactual sequence. What matters for an agent’s freedom\nand moral responsibility is not what might have happened, but how his\naction was actually brought about. What matters is not whether the\nagent had the ability to do otherwise, but whether he was the source\nof his actions. \n\nThe success of Frankfurt-style cases is hotly contested. An early\nand far-reaching criticism is due to David Widerker (1995), Carl Ginet\n(1996), and Robert Kane (1996, 142–43). According to this\ncriticism, proponents of Frankfurt-style cases face a dilemma: either\nthese cases assume that the connection between the indicator (in our\ncase, the absence of Jones’s showing any inclination to decide to\nvote for Bush) and the agent’s decision (here, Jones’s\ndeciding to vote for Clinton) is deterministic or not. If the\nconnection is deterministic, then Frankfurt-style cases cannot be\nexpected to convince incompatibilists that the ability to do otherwise\nis not necessary for moral responsibility and/or free will, since\nJones’s action will be deterministically brought about by factors\nbeyond his control, leading incompatibilists to conclude that Jones is\nnot morally responsible for his decision. But if the connection is\nnondeterministic, then it is possible even in the absence of showing\nany inclination to decide to vote for Bush, that Jones decides to vote\nfor Bush, and so he retains the ability to do otherwise. Either way\nFrankfurt-style cases fail to show that Jones is both morally\nresponsible for his decision and yet is unable to do otherwise. \n\nWhile some have argued that even Frankfurt-style cases that assume\ndeterminism are effective (see, e.g., Fischer 1999, 2010, 2013 and\nHaji and McKenna 2004 and for criticisms of this approach, see Goetz\n2005, Palmer 2005, 2014, Widerker and Goetz 2013, and Cohen 2017), the\nmajority of proponents of Frankfurt-style cases have attempted to\nrevise these cases so that they are explicitly nondeterministic and\nyet still show that the agent was morally responsible even though he\nlacked the ability to do otherwise—or, at least that he lacked\nany ability to do otherwise that could be relevant\nto grounding the agent’s moral responsibility (see,\ne.g., Mele and Robb 1998, 2003, Pereboom 2001, 2014, McKenna 2003,\nHunt 2005, and for criticisms of these cases see Ginet 2002, Timpe\n2006, Widerker 2006, Franklin 2011c, Moya 2011, Palmer 2011, 2013,\nRobinson 2014, Capes 2016, Capes and Swenson 2017, and Elzein\n2017). \n\nSupposing that Frankfurt-style cases are successful, what exactly\ndo they show? In our view, they show neither that free will\nand moral responsibility do not require an ability to do otherwise\nin any sense nor that compatibilism is true. Frankfurt-style\ncases are of clear help to the compatibilists’ position (though\nsee Speak 2007 for a dissenting opinion). The Consequence Argument\nraises a powerful challenge to the cogency of compatibilism. But if\nFrankfurt-style cases are successful, agents can act freely in the\nsense relevant to moral responsibility while lacking the ability to do\notherwise in the all-in sense. This allows compatibilists to concede\nthat the all-in ability to do otherwise is incompatible with\ndeterminism, and yet insist that it is irrelevant to the question of\nthe compatibility of determinism with moral responsibility (and\nperhaps even free will, depending on how we define this) (cf. Fischer\n1987, 1994. For a challenge to the move from not strictly necessary to\nirrelevant, see O’Connor [2000, 20–22] and in reply,\nFischer [2006, 152–56].). But, of course, showing that an\nargument for the falsity of compatibilism is irrelevant does not show\nthat compatibilism is true. Indeed, many incompatibilists maintain\nthat Frankfurt-style cases are successful and defend incompatibilism\nnot via the Consequence Argument, but by way of arguments that attempt\nto show that agents in deterministic worlds cannot be the\n‘source’ of their actions in the way that moral\nresponsibility requires (Stump 1999; Zagzebski 2000; Pereboom 2001,\n2014). Thus, if successful, Frankfurt-style cases would be at best the\nfirst step in defending compatibilism. The second step must offer an\nanalysis of the kind of sourcehood constitutive of free will that\nentails that free will is compatible with determinism (cf. Fischer\n1982). \n\nFurthermore, while proponents of Frankfurt-style cases often maintain\nthat these cases show that no ability to do otherwise is necessary for\nmoral responsibility (“I have employed the Frankfurt-type\nexample to argue that this sense of control [i.e. the one required for\nmoral responsibility] need not involve any alternative\npossibilities” [Fischer 2006, p. 58; emphasis ours]), we believe\nthat this conclusion overreaches. At best, Frankfurt-style cases\nshow that the ability to do otherwise in the all-in\nsense—in the sense defined by the Categorical\nAnalysis—is not necessary for free will or moral\nresponsibility (cf. Franklin 2015). To appreciate this, let us assume\nthat in the above Frankfurt-style case Jones lacks the ability to do\notherwise in the all-in sense: there is no possible world in which we\nhold fixed the past and laws and yet Jones does otherwise, since all\nsuch worlds include Black and his preparations for preventing Jones\nfrom doing otherwise should Jones show any inclination. Even if this\nis all true, it should take only a little reflection to recognize that\nin this case Jones is able to do otherwise in certain weaker senses we\nmight attach to that phrase, and compatibilists in fact still think\nthat the ability to do otherwise in some such senses is necessary for\nfree will and moral responsibility. Consequently, even though\nFrankfurt-style cases have, as a matter of fact, moved many\ncompatibilists away from emphasizing ability to do otherwise to\nemphasizing sourcehood, we suggest that this move is best seen as a\nweakening of the ability-to-do-otherwise condition on moral\nresponsibility. (A potentially important exception to\nthis claim is Sartorio [2016], who appealing to some controversial\nideas in the metaphysics of causation appears to argue that no sense\nof the ability to do otherwise is necessary for control in the sense\nat stake for moral responsibility, but instead what matters is whether\nthe agent is the cause of the action. We simply note that\nSartorio’s account of causation is a modal one [see especially\nSartorio (2016, 94–95, 132–37)] and thus it is far from\nclear that her account of freedom and responsibility is really an\nexception.) \n\nIn this section, we will assume that Frankfurt-style cases are\nsuccessful in order to consider two prominent compatibilist attempts\nto construct analyses of the sourcehood condition (though see\n the entry on \n compatibilism\n for a more systematic survey of compatibilist\ntheories of free will). The first, and perhaps most popular,\ncompatibilist model is a reasons-responsiveness model. According to\nthis model, an agent’s action \\(\\phi\\) is free just in case the\nagent or manner in which the action is brought about is responsive to\nthe reasons available to the agent at the time of action. While\ncompatibilists develop this kind of account in different ways, the\nmost detailed proposal is due to John Martin Fischer (1994, 2006,\n2010, 2012; Fischer and Ravizza 1998. For similar compatibilist\ntreatments of reasons-responsiveness, see Wolf 1990, Wallace 1994,\nHaji 1998, Nelkin 2011, McKenna 2013, Vargas 2013, Sartorio\n2016). Fischer and Ravizza argue that an agent’s action is free\nand one for which he is morally responsible only if the mechanism that\nissued in the action is moderately reasons-responsive (Fischer and\nRavizza 1998, ch. 3). By ‘mechanism’, Fischer and Ravizza\nsimply mean “the way the action was brought about”\n(38). One mechanism they often discuss is practical deliberation. For\nexample, in the case of Jones discussed above, his decision to vote\nfor Clinton on his own was brought about by the process of practical\ndeliberation. What must be true of this process, this mechanism, for\nit to be moderately reasons-responsive? Fischer and Ravizza maintain\nthat moderate reasons-responsiveness consists in two conditions:\nreasons-receptivity and reasons-reactivity. A mechanism’s\nreasons-receptivity depends on the agent’s cognitive capacities,\nsuch as being capable of understanding moral reasons and the\nimplications of their actions (69–73). The second condition is\nmore important for us in the present context. A mechanism’s\nreasons-reactivity depends on how the mechanism would react\ngiven different reasons for action.  Fischer and Ravizza argue that\nthe kind of reasons-reactivity at stake is weak reasons-reactivity,\nwhere this merely requires that there is some possible world in which\nthe laws of nature remain the same, the same mechanism operates,\nthere is a sufficient reason to do otherwise, and the mechanism brings\nabout this the alternative action in response to this sufficient\nreason (73–76). On this analysis, while Jones, due to the\nactivity of Black, lacks the all-in sense of the ability to do\notherwise, he is nevertheless morally responsible for deciding to vote\nfor Clinton because his action finds its source in Jones’s\npractical deliberation that is moderately\nreasons-responsive. \n\nFischer and Ravizza offer a novel and powerful theory of freedom and\nresponsibility, one that has shifted the focus of recent debate to\nquestions of sourcehood. Moreover, one might argue that this theory is\na clear improvement over classical compatibilism with respect to\nhandling cases of phobia. By focusing on mechanisms, Fischer and\nRavizza can argue that our agoraphobic Luke is not morally responsible\nfor deciding to refrain from going outside because the mechanism that\nissues in this action—namely his agoraphobia—is not\nmoderately reasons-responsive. There is no world with the same laws of\nnature as our own, this mechanism operates, and yet it reacts to a\nsufficient reason to go outside. No matter what reasons there are for\nLuke to go outside, when acting on this mechanism, he will always\nrefrain from going outside (cf. Fischer 1987, 74). \n\nBefore turning to our second compatibilist model, it is worth noting\nthat it would be a mistake to think that Fischer and Ravizza’s\naccount is a sourcehood account to the exclusion of the ability to do\notherwise in any sense. As we have just seen, Fischer and\nRavizza place clear modal requirements on mechanisms that\nissue in actions with respect to which agents are free and morally\nresponsible. Indeed, this should be clear from the very idea of\nreasons-responsiveness. Whether one is responsive depends not merely\non how one does respond, but also on how one would\nrespond. Thus, any account that makes reasons-responsiveness an\nessential condition of free will is an account that makes the ability\nto do otherwise, in some sense, necessary for free will (Fischer\n[forthcoming] concedes this point, though, as noted above, the reader\nshould consider Sartorio [2016] as a potential counterexample to this\nclaim). \n\nThe second main compatibilist model of sourcehood is an identification\nmodel. Accounts of sourcehood of this kind lay stress on\nself-determination or autonomy: to be the source of her action the\nagent must self-determine her action. Like the contemporary discussion\nof the ability to do otherwise, the contemporary discussion of the\npower of self-determination begins with the failure of classical\ncompatibilism to produce an acceptable definition. According to\nclassical compatibilists, self-determination simply consists in the\nagent’s action being determined by her strongest motive. On the\nassumption that some compulsive agents’ compulsions operate by\ngenerating irresistible desires to act in certain ways, the classical\ncompatibilist analysis of self-determination implies that these\ncompulsive actions are self-determined. While Hobbes seems willing to\naccept this implication (1656 [1999], 78), most contemporary\ncompatibilists concede that this result is unacceptable. \n\nBeginning with the work of Harry Frankfurt (1971) and Gary Watson\n(1975), many compatibilists have developed identification accounts of\nself-determination that attempt to draw a distinction between an\nagent’s desires or motives that are internal to the agent and\nfrom those that are external. The idea is that while agents are not\n(or at least may not be) identical to any motivations (or bundle of\nmotivations), they are identified with a subset of their\nmotivations, rendering these motivations internal to the agent in such\na way that any actions brought about by these motivations are\nself-determined. The identification relation is not an\nidentity relation, but something weaker (cf. Bratman 2000, 39n12). What\nthe precise nature of the identification relation is and to which\nattitudes an agent stands in this relation is hotly disputed.\nLippert-Rasmussen (2003) helpfully divides identification accounts into\ntwo main types. The first are “authority” accounts,\naccording to which agents are identified with attitudes that are\nauthorized to speak for them (386). The second are\nauthenticity accounts, according to which agents are identified with\nattitudes that reveal who they truly are (368). (But see\nShoemaker 2015 for an ecumenical account of identification that blends\nthese two accounts.) Proposed attitudes to which agents are said to\nstand in the identification relation include higher-order desires\n(Frankfurt 1971), cares or loves (Frankfurt 1993, 1994; Shoemaker 2003;\nJaworska 2007; Sripada 2016), self-governing policies (Bratman 2000),\nthe desire to make sense of oneself (Velleman 1992, 2009), and\nperceptions (or judgments) of the good (or best) (Watson 1975; Stump\n1988; Ekstrom 1993; Mitchell-Yellin 2015). \n\nThe distinction between internal and external motivations allows\nidentification theorists to enrich classical compatibilists’\nunderstanding of constraint, while remaining compatibilists about free\nwill and determinism. According to classical compatibilists, the only\nkind of constraint is external (e.g., broken cars and broken legs),\nbut addictions and phobias seem just as threatening to free will.\nIdentification theorists have the resources to concede that some\nconstraints are internal. For example, they can argue that our\nagoraphobic Luke is not free in refraining from going outside even\nthough this decision was caused by his strongest desires because he is\nnot identified with his strongest desires. On compatibilist\nidentification accounts, what matters for self-determination is not\nwhether our actions are determined or undetermined, but whether they\nare brought about by motives with which the agent is identified:\nexercises of the power of self-determination consists in an\nagent’s actions being brought about, in part, by an\nagent’s motives with which she is identified. (It is important\nto note that while we have distinguished reasons-responsive accounts\nfrom identification accounts, there is nothing preventing one from\ncombing both elements in a complete analysis of free will.) \n\nEven if these reasons-responsive and identification compatibilist\naccounts of sourcehood might successfully side-step the Consequence\nArgument, they must come to grips with a second incompatibilist\nargument: the Manipulation Argument. The general problem raised by\nthis line of argument is that whatever proposed compatibilist\nconditions for an agent \\(S\\)’s being free with respect to, and\nmorally responsible for, some action \\(\\phi\\), it will seem that\nagents can be manipulated into satisfying these conditions with\nrespect to \\(\\phi\\) and, yet, precisely because they are manipulated\ninto satisfying these conditions, their freedom and responsibility\nseem undermined. The two most influential forms of the Manipulation\nArgument are Pereboom’s Four-case Argument (2001, ch. 4; 2014,\nch. 4) and Mele’s Zygote Argument (2006, ch. 7. See Todd 2010,\n2012 for developments of Mele’s argument). As the structure of\nMele’s version is simpler, we will focus on it. \n\nImagine a goddess Diana who creates a zygote \\(Z\\) in Mary in some\ndeterministic world. Suppose that Diana creates \\(Z\\) as she does\nbecause she wants Jones to be murdered thirty years later. From her\nknowledge of the laws of nature in her world and her knowledge of the\nstate of the world just prior to her creating \\(Z\\), she knows that a\nzygote with precisely \\(Z\\)’s constitution located in Mary will\ndevelop into an agent Ernie who, thirty years later, will murder Jones\nas a result of his moderately reasons-responsive mechanism and on the\nbasis of motivations with which he is identified (whatever those might\nbe).  Suppose Diana succeeds in her plan and Ernie murders Jones as a\nresult of her manipulation. \n\nMany judge that Ernie is not morally responsible for murdering Jones\neven though he satisfies both the reasons-responsive and\nidentification criteria. There are two possible lines of reply open to\ncompatibilists.  On the soft-line reply, compatibilists attempt to\nshow that there is a relevant difference between manipulated agents\nsuch as Ernie and agents who satisfy their account (McKenna 2008,\n470). For example, Fischer and Ravizza propose a second condition on\nsourcehood: in addition to a mechanism’s being moderately\nreasons-responsive, an agent is morally responsible for the output of\nsuch a mechanism only if the agent has come to take responsibility for\nthe mechanism, where an agent has taken responsibility for a mechanism\n\\(M\\) just in case (i) she believes that she is an agent when acting\nfrom \\(M\\), (ii) she believes that she is an apt target for blame and\npraise for acting from \\(M\\), and (iii) her beliefs specified in (i)\nand (ii) are “based, in an appropriate way, on [her]\nevidence” (Fischer and Ravizza 1998, 238). The problem with this\nreply is that we can easily imagine Diana creating Ernie so that his\nmurdering Jones is a result not only of a moderately\nreasons-responsive mechanism, but also a mechanism for which he has\ntaken responsibility. On the hard-line reply, compatibilists concede\nthat, despite initial appearances, the manipulated agent is free and\nmorally responsible and attempt to ameliorate the seeming counterintuitiveness of this concession (McKenna\n2008, 470–71). Here compatibilists might point out that the idea\nof being manipulated is worrisome only so long as the manipulators are\ninterfering with an agent’s development. But if the manipulators\nsimply create a person, and then allow that person’s life to\nunfold without any further inference, the manipulators’ activity\nis no threat to freedom (McKenna 2008; Fischer 2011; Sartorio 2016,\nch. 5). (For other responses to the Manipulation Argument, see Kearns\n2012; Sripada 2012; McKenna 2014.) \n\nDespite these compatibilist replies, to some the idea that the\nentirety of a free agent’s life can be determined, and\nin this way controlled, by another agent will seem incredible. Some\ntake the lesson of the Manipulation Argument to be that no\ncompatibilist account of sourcehood or self-determination is\nsatisfactory. True sourcehood—the kind of sourcehood that can\nactually ground an agent’s freedom and\nresponsibility—requires, so it is argued, that one’s\naction not be causally determined by factors beyond one’s\ncontrol. \n\nLibertarians, while united in endorsing this negative condition on\nsourcehood, are deeply divided concerning which further positive\nconditions may be required. It is important to note that while\nlibertarians are united in insisting that compatibilist accounts of\nsourcehood are insufficient, they are not committed to thinking that\nthe conditions of freedom spelled out in terms either of\nreasons-responsiveness or of identification are not necessary. For\nexample, Stump (1988, 1996, 2010) builds a sophisticated libertarian\nmodel of free will out of resources originally developed within\nFrankfurt’s identification model (see also Ekstrom 1993, 2000;\nFranklin 2014) and nearly all libertarians agree that exercises of\nfree will require agents to be reasons-responsive (e.g., Kane 1996;\nO’Connor 2009a; Clarke 2003, chs. 8–9; Franklin 2018, ch. 2). Moreover, while\nthis section focuses on libertarian accounts of sourcehood, we remind\nreaders that most (if not all) libertarians think that the freedom to\ndo otherwise is also necessary for free will and moral\nresponsibility. \n\nThere are three main libertarian options for understanding sourcehood\nor self-determination: non-causal libertarianism (Ginet 1990, 2008;\nMcCann 1998; Lowe 2008; Goetz 2009; Pink 2017), event-causal\nlibertarianism (Wiggins 1973; Kane 1996, 1999, 2011, 2016; Mele 1995,\nchs. 11–12; 2006, chs. 4–5; 2017; Ekstrom 2000,\nforthcoming; Clarke 2003, chs. 2–6; Franklin 2018), and\nagent-causal libertarianism (Reid 1788 [1969]; Chisholm 1966, 1976;\nTaylor 1966; O’Connor 2000, 2005, 2009a; Clarke 1993; 1996;\n2003, chs. 8–10; Griffith 2010; Steward 2012). Non-causal\nlibertarians contend that exercises of the power of self-determination\nneed not (or perhaps even cannot) be caused or causally\nstructured. According to this view, we control our volition or choice\nsimply in virtue of its being ours—its occurring in us. We do\nnot exert a special kind of causality in bringing it about; instead,\nit is an intrinsically active event, intrinsically something\nwe do. While there may be causal influences upon our choice,\nthere need not be, and any such causal influence is wholly irrelevant\nto understanding why it occurs. Reasons provide an autonomous,\nnon-causal form of explanation. Provided our choice is not wholly\ndetermined by prior factors, it is free and under our control simply\nin virtue of being ours. Non-causal views have failed to garner wide\nsupport among libertarians since, for many,\nself-determination seems to be an essentially causal notion\n(cf. O’Connor 1993; 2000, ch. 2; Mele 2000; Clarke 2003, ch.\n2). \n\nMost libertarians endorse an event-causal or agent-causal account of\nsourcehood. Both these accounts maintain that exercises of the power\nof self-determination consist partly in the agent’s bringing\nabout her choice or action, but they disagree on how to analyze an\nagent’s bringing about her choice. While event-causal\nlibertarianism admits of different species, at the heart of this view\nis the idea that self-determining an action requires, at minimum, that\nthe agent cause the action and that an agent’s causing his\naction is wholly reducible to mental states and other events\ninvolving the agent nondeviantly causing his action. Consider an\nagent’s raising his hand. According to the event-causal model at\nits most basic level, an agent’s raising his hand consists in\nthe agent’s causing his hand to rise and his causing his hand to\nrise consists in apt mental states and events involving the\nagent—such as the agent’s desire to ask a question and his\nbelief that he can ask a question by raising his\nhand—nondeviantly causing his hand to rise. (The\nnondeviance clause is required since it seems possible that an event\nbe brought about by one’s desires and beliefs and yet not be\nself-determined, or even an action for that matter, due to the unusual\ncausal path leading from the desires and beliefs to action. Imagine a\nwould-be accomplice of an assassin believes that his dropping his\ncigarette is the signal for the assassin to shoot his intended victim\nand he desires to drop his cigarette and yet this belief and desire so\nunnerve him that he accidentally drops his cigarette. While the event\nof dropping the cigarette is caused by a relevant desire and belief it\ndoes not seem to be self-determined and perhaps is not even an action\n[cf. Davidson 1973].) To fully spell out this account, event-causal\nlibertarians must specify which mental states and events are apt (cf.\nBrand 1979)—which mental states and events are the springs of\nself-determined actions—and what nondeviance consists in (cf.\nBishop 1989). (We note that this has proven very difficult, enough so\nthat some take the problem to spell doom for event-causal theories of\naction. Such philosophers [e.g., Taylor 1966 and Sehon 2005] take\nagential power to be conceptually and/or ontologically primitive and\nunderstand reasons explanations of action in irreducibly teleological\nterms. See Stout 2010 for a brisk survey of discussions of this\ntopic.)  For ease, in what follows we will assume that apt mental\nstates are an agent’s reasons that favor the action. \n\nEvent-causal libertarians, of course, contend that self-determination\nrequires more than nondeviant causation by agents’ reasons: for\nit is possible that agents’ actions in deterministic worlds are\nnondeviantly caused by apt mental states and\nevents. Self-determination requires nondeterministic\ncausation, in a nondeviant way, by an agent’s reasons. While\nhistorically many have thought that nondeterministic causation is\nimpossible (Hobbes 1654 [1999], 1656 [1999]; Hume 1740 [1978], 1748\n[1975]), with the advent of quantum physics and, from a very different\ndirection, an influential essay by G. E. M. Anscombe (1971), it is now\nwidely assumed that nondeterministic (or probabilistic) causation is\npossible. There are two importantly different ways to understand\nnondeterministic causation: as the causation of probability or as the\nprobability of causation (cf. Jacobs and O’Connor 2013). Under\nthe causation of probability model, a nondeterministic cause \\(C\\)\ncauses (or causally contributes to) the objective probability of the\noutcome’s occurring rather than the outcome itself. On this\naccount, \\(S\\)’s reasons do not cause his decision but there\nbeing a certain antecedent objective probability of its occurring, and\nthe decision itself is uncaused. On the competing probability of\ncausation model, a nondeterministic cause \\(C\\) causes the outcome of\na nondeterministic process. Given that \\(C\\) is a nondeterministic\ncause of the outcome, it was possible given the exact same past and\nlaws of nature that \\(C\\) not cause the outcome (perhaps because it\nwas possible that some other event cause some other outcome)—the\nprobability of this causal transaction’s occurring was less than\n\\(1\\). Given that event-causal libertarians maintain that\nself-determined actions, and thus free actions, must be caused, they\nare committed to the probability of causation model of\nnondeterministic causation (cf. Franklin 2018, 25–26). (We note\nthat Balaguer [2010] is skeptical of the above distinction, and it is\nthus unclear whether he should best be classified as a non-causal or\nevent-causal libertarian though see Balaguer [2014] for evidence that\nit is best to treat him as a non-causalist.) Consequently, according\nto event-causal libertarians, when an agent \\(S\\) self-determines his\nchoice \\(\\phi\\), then \\(S\\)’s reasons \\(r_1\\)\nnondeterministically cause (in a nondeviant way) \\(\\phi\\), and it was\npossible, given the past and laws, that \\(r_1\\) not have caused\n\\(\\phi\\), but rather some of \\(S\\)’s other reasons \\(r_2\\)\nnondeterministically caused (in a nondeviant way) a different action\n\\(\\psi\\). \n\nAgent-causal libertarians contend that the event-causal picture fails\nto capture self-determination, for it fails to accord the agent with a\npower to settle what she does. Pereboom offers a forceful\nstatement of this worry: \n\nOn an event-causal libertarian picture, the relevant causal conditions\nantecedent to the decision, i.e., the occurrence of certain\nagent-involving events, do not settle whether the decision will occur,\nbut only render the occurrence of the decision about \\(50\\%\\)\nprobable. In fact, because no occurrence of antecedent events settles\nwhether the decision will occur, and only antecedent events are\ncausally relevant,\nnothing settles whether the decision will occur. (Pereboom\n2014, 32; cf. Watson 1987, 1996; O’Connor 1993, 1996; Clarke\n2003, ch. 8; 2011; Griffith 2010; Shabo 2011, 2013; Steward 2012, ch.\n3; Schlosser 2014) \n\nOn the event-causal picture, the agent’s causal contribution to\nher actions is exhausted by the causal contribution of her reasons,\nand yet her reasons leave open which decisions she will make, and this\nseems insufficient for self-determination. \n\nBut what more must be added? Agent-causal libertarians maintain that\nself-determination requires that the agent herself play a\ncausal role over and above the causal role played by her reasons. Some\nagent-causal libertarians deny that an agent’s reasons play any\ndirect causal role in bringing about an agent’s self-determined\nactions (Chisholm 1966; O’Connor 2000, ch. 5; 2009a), whereas\nothers allow or even require that self-determined actions be caused in\npart by the agent’s reasons (Clarke 2003, ch. 9; Steward 2012,\nch. 3). But all agent-causal libertarians insist that exercises of the\npower of self-determination do not reduce to nondeterministic\ncausation by apt mental states: agent-causation does not reduce to\nevent-causation. \n\nAgent-causal libertarianism seems to capture an aspect of\nself-determination that neither the above compatibilists accounts nor\nevent-causal libertarian accounts capture. (Some compatibilists even\naccept this and try to incorporate agent-causation into a\ncompatibilist understanding of free will. See Markosian 1999, 2012;\nNelkin 2011.)  These accounts reduce the causal role of the self to\nstates and events to which the agent is not identical (even if he is\nidentified with them). But how can self-determination of my\nactions wholly reduce to determination of my actions by\nthings other than the self? Richard Taylor nicely expresses\nthis intuition: “If I believe that something not identical to\nmyself was the cause of my behavior—some event wholly external\nto myself, for instance, or even one internal to myself, such as a\nnerve impulse, volition, or whatnot—then I cannot regard the\nbehavior as being an act of mine, unless I further believed that I was\nthe cause of that external or internal event” (1974, 55;\ncf. Franklin 2016). \n\nDespite its powerful intuitive pull for some, many have argued that\nagent-causal libertarianism is obscure or even incoherent. The stock\nobjection used to be that the very idea of\nagent-causation—causation by agents that is not reducible to\ncausation by mental states and events involving the agent—is\nincoherent, but this objection has become less common due to\npioneering work by Chisholm (1966, 1976), Taylor (1974),\nO’Connor (1995a, 2000, 2005, 2009a), and Clarke (1993, 1996,\n2003) (for helpful critical discussions of these worries see Clarke\n2003, ch. 10; O’Connor 2011; and Steward 2012, ch. 8). More\ncommon objections now concern, first, how to understand the\nrelationship between agent-causation and an agent’s reasons (or\nmotivations in general), and, second, the empirical adequacy of\nagent-causal libertarianism. With respect to the first worry, it is\nwidely assumed that the only (or at least best) way to understand\nreasons-explanation and motivational influence is within a causal\naccount of reasons, where reasons cause our actions (Davidson 1963;\nMele 1992). If agent-causal libertarians accept that self-determined\nactions, in addition to being agent-caused, must also be caused by\nagents’ reasons that favored those actions, then agent-causal\nlibertarians need to explain how to integrate these causes (for a\nsophisticated attempt to do just this, see Clarke 2003, ch. 8).  Given\nthat these two causes seem distinct, is it not possible that the agent\ncause his decision to \\(\\phi\\) and yet the agent’s reasons\nsimultaneously cause an incompatible decision to \\(\\psi\\)? If\nagent-causal libertarians side-step this difficult question by denying\nthat reasons cause action, then they must explain how reasons can\nexplain and motivate action without causing it; and this has turned\nout to be no easy task (but for a sophisticated attempt to do just\nthis, see O’Connor 2000, 2009a; for more general attempts to\nunderstand reasons-explanation and motivation within a non-causal\nframework see Schueler 1995, 2003; Sehon 2005). For further discussion\n see the entry on\n incompatibilist (nondeterministic) theories of free will.\n  \n\nFinally, we note that some recent philosophers have questioned the\npresumed difference between event- and agent-causation by arguing that\nall causation is object or substance causation. They argue\nthat the dominant tendency to understand ‘garden variety’\ncausal transactions in the world as relations between events is an\nunfortunate legacy of David Hume’s rejection of substance and\ncausation as basic metaphysical categories. On the competing\nmetaphysical picture of the world, the event or state of an\nobject’s having some property such as mass is its having a\ncausal power, which in suitable circumstances it exercises to bring\nabout a characteristic effect. Applied to human agents in an account\nof free will, the account suggests a picture on which an agent’s\nhaving desires, beliefs, and intentions are rational powers to will\nparticular courses of action, and where the agent’s willing is\nnot determined in any one direction, she wills freely. An advantage\nfor the agent-causalist who embraces this broader metaphysics is\n‘ideological’ parsimony. For different developments and\ndefenses of this approach, see Lowe (2008), Swinburne (2013), and\nJacobs and O’Connor (2013). \n\nMost philosophers theorizing about free will take themselves to be\nattempting to analyze a near-universal power of mature human beings.\nBut as we’ve noted above, there have been free will skeptics in\nboth ancient and (especially) modern times. (Israel 2001 highlights a\nnumber of such skeptics in the early modern period.) In this section,\nwe summarize the main lines of argument both for and against the\nreality of human freedom of will. \n\nThere are both a priori and empirical arguments against free will (See\n the entry on \n skepticism about moral responsibility).\n Several of these start with an argument that free will is incompatible\nwith causal determinism, which we will not rehearse here. Instead, we\nfocus on arguments that human beings lack free will, against the\nbackground assumption that freedom and causal determinism are\nincompatible. \n\nThe most radical a priori argument is that free will is not merely\ncontingently absent but is impossible. In recent decades, this\nargument is most associated with Galen Strawson (1986, ch. 2; 1994,\n2002). Strawson associates free will with being ‘ultimately\nmorally responsible’ for one’s actions. He argues that,\nbecause how one acts is a result of, or explained by, “how one\nis, mentally speaking” (\\(M\\)), for one to be responsible for\nthat choice one must be responsible for \\(M\\). To be responsible for\n\\(M\\), one must have chosen to be \\(M\\) itself—and that not\nblindly, but deliberately, in accordance with some reasons\n\\(r_1\\). But for that choice to be a responsible one, one must have\nchosen to be such as to be moved by \\(r_1\\), requiring some further\nreasons \\(r_2\\) for such a choice. And so on, ad\ninfinitum. Free choice requires an impossible infinite regress of\nchoices to be the way one is in making choices. \n\nThere have been numerous replies to Strawson’s argument. Mele\n(1995, 221ff.) argues that Strawson misconstrues the locus of freedom\nand responsibility. Freedom is principally a feature of our actions,\nand only derivatively of our characters from which such actions\nspring.  The task of the theorist is to show how one is in rational,\nreflective control of the choices one makes, consistent with there\nbeing no freedom-negating conditions. While this seems right, when\nconsidering those theories that make one’s free control to\nreside directly in the causal efficacy of one’s reasons (such as\ncompatibilist reasons-responsive accounts or event-causal\nlibertarianism), it is not beside the point to reflect on how one came\nto be that way in the first place and to worry that such reflection\nshould lead one to conclude that true responsibility (and hence\nfreedom) is undermined, since a complete distal source of any action\nmay be found external to the agent. Clarke (2003, 170–76) argues\nthat an effective reply may be made by indeterminists, and, in\nparticular, by nondeterministic agent-causal theorists. Such theorists\ncontend that (i) aspects of ‘how one is, mentally\nspeaking’, fully explain an agent’s choice\nwithout causally determining it and (ii) the agent himself causes the\nchoice that is made (so that the agent’s antecedent state, while\ngrounding an explanation of the action, is not the complete causal\nsource of it). Since the agent’s exercise of this power is\ncausally undetermined, it is not true that there is a sufficient\n‘ultimate’ source of it external to the agent.  Finally,\nMele (2006, 129–34, and 2017, 212–16) and O’Connor\n(2005, 2009b) suggest that freedom and moral responsibility come in\ndegrees and grow over time, reflecting the fact that ‘how one\nis, mentally speaking’ is increasingly shaped by one’s own\npast choices. Furthermore, some choices for a given individual may\nreflect more freedom and responsibility than others, which may be the\nkernel of truth behind Strawson’s sweeping argument. (For\ndiscussion of the ways that nature, nurture, and contingent\ncircumstances shape our behavior and raise deep issues concerning\nthe extent of our freedom and responsibility, see Levy 2011\nand Russell 2017, chs. 10–12.) \n\nA second family of arguments against free will contend that, in one\nway or another, nondeterministic theories of freedom entail either\nthat agents lack control over their choices or that the choices cannot\nbe adequately explained. These arguments are variously called the\n‘Mind’, ‘Rollback’, or ‘Luck’\nargument, with the latter admitting of several versions. (For\nstatements of such arguments, see van Inwagen 1983, ch. 4; 2000; Haji\n2001; Mele 2006; Shabo 2011, 2013, forthcoming; Coffman 2015). We note\nthat some philosophers advance such arguments not as parts of a\ngeneral case against free will, but merely as showing the inadequacy\nof specific accounts of free will [see, e.g., Griffith 2010].) They\neach describe imagined cases—individual cases, or comparison of\nintra- or inter-world duplicate antecedent conditions followed by\ndiverging outcomes—designed to elicit the judgment that the\noccurrence of a choice that had remained unsettled given all\nprior causal factors can only be a ‘matter of chance’,\n‘random’, or ‘a matter of luck’. Such terms\nhave been imported from other contexts and have come to function as\nquasi-technical, unanalyzed concepts in these debates, and it is\nperhaps more helpful to avoid such proxies and to conduct the debates\ndirectly in terms of the metaphysical notion of control and epistemic\nnotion of explanation. Where the arguments question whether an\nundetermined agent can exercise appropriate control over the choice he\nmakes, proponents of nondeterministic theories often reply that\ncontrol is not exercised prior to, but at the time of the\nchoice—in the very act of bringing it about (see, e.g., Clarke\n2005 and O’Connor 2007). Where the arguments question whether\nundetermined choices can be adequately explained, the reply often\nconsists in identifying a form of explanation other than the form\ndemanded by the critic—a ‘noncontrastive’\nexplanation, perhaps, rather than a ‘contrastive’\nexplanation, or a species of contrastive explanation consistent with\nindeterminism (see, e.g., Kane 1999; O’Connor 2000, ch. 5;\nClarke, 2003, ch. 8; and Franklin 2011a; 2018, ch. 5). \n\nWe now consider empirical arguments against human freedom. Some of\nthese stem from the physical sciences (while making assumptions\nconcerning the way physical phenomena fix psychological phenomena) and\nothers from neuroscience and psychology. \n\nIt used to be common for philosophers to argue that there is empirical\nreason to believe that the world in general is causally determined,\nand since human beings are parts of the world, they are too. Many took\nthis to be strongly confirmed by the spectacular success of Isaac\nNewton’s framework for understanding the universe as governed\neverywhere by fairly simple, exceptionless laws of motion. But the\nquantum revolution of the early twentieth century has made that\n‘clockwork universe’ image at least doubtful at the level\nof basic physics. While quantum mechanics has proven spectacularly\nsuccessful as a framework for making precise and accurate predictions\nof certain observable phenomena, its implications for the causal\nstructure of reality is still not well understood, and there are\n competing indeterministic and deterministic interpretations. See the\n entry on\n quantum mechanics \n for detailed discussion.) It is possible that\nindeterminacy on the small-scale, supposing it to be genuine,\n‘cancels out’ at the macroscopic scale of birds and\nbuildings and people, so that behavior at this scale is virtually\ndeterministic. But this idea, once common, is now being challenged\nempirically, even at the level of basic biology. Furthermore, the\nsocial, biological, and medical sciences, too, are rife with merely\nstatistical generalizations. Plainly, the jury is out on all these\ninter-theoretic questions. But that is just a way to say that current\nscience does not decisively support the idea that everything\nwe do is pre-determined by the past, and ultimately by the distant\npast, wholly out of our control. For discussion, see Balaguer (2009),\nKoch (2009), Roskies (2014), Ellis (2016). \n\nMaybe, then, we are subject to myriad causal influences, but the sum\ntotal of these influences doesn’t determine what we do, they\nonly make it more or less likely that we’ll do this or that. Now\nsome of the a priori no-free-will arguments above center on\nnondeterministic theories according to which there are objective\nantecedent probabilities associated with each possible choice\noutcome. Why objective probabilities of this kind might present\nspecial problems beyond those posed by the absence of determinism has\nbeen insufficiently explored to date. (For brief discussion, see\nVicens 2016 and O’Connor 2016.) But one philosopher who argues\nthat there is reason to hold that our actions, if undetermined, are\ngoverned by objective probabilities and that this fact calls into\nquestion whether we act freely is Derk Pereboom (2001, ch. 3; 2014,\nch. 3). Pereboom notes that our best physical theories indicate that\nstatistical laws govern isolated, small-scale physical events, and he\ninfers from the thesis that human beings are wholly physically\ncomposed that such statistical laws will also govern all the physical\ncomponents of human actions. Finally, Pereboom maintains that\nagent-causal libertarianism offers the correct analysis of free\nwill. He then invites us to imagine that the antecedent probability of\nsome physical component of an action occurring is \\(0.32\\). If the action\nis free while not violating the statistical law, then, in a scenario\nwith a large enough number of instances, this action would have to be\nfreely chosen close to \\(32\\) percent of the time. This leads to the\nproblem of “wild coincidences”: \n\nif the occurrence of these physical components were settled by the\nchoices of agent-causes, then their actually being chosen close to 32\npercent of the time would amount to a coincidence no less wild than\nthe coincidence of possible actions whose physical components have an\nantecedent probability of about 0.99 being chosen, over large enough\nnumber of instances, close to 99 percent of the time. The proposal\nthat agent-caused free choices do not diverge from what the\nstatistical laws predict for the physical components of our actions\nwould run so sharply counter to what we would expect as to make it\nincredible. (2014, 67) \n\nClarke (2010) questions the implicit assumption that free agent-causal\nchoices should be expected not to conform to physical\nstatistical laws, while O’Connor (2009a) challenges the more\ngeneral assumption that freedom requires that agent-causal choices not\nbe governed by statistical laws of any kind, as they plausibly would\nbe if the relevant psychological states/powers are strongly emergent\nfrom physical states of the human brain. \n\nPereboom’s empirical basis for free will skepticism is very\ngeneral. Others see support for free will skepticism from specific\nfindings and theories in the human sciences. They point to evidence\nthat we can be unconsciously influenced in the choices we make by a\nrange of factors, including ones that are not motivationally relevant;\nthat we can come to believe that we chose to initiate a behavior that\nin fact was artificially induced; that people subject to certain\nneurological disorders will sometimes engage in purposive behavior\nwhile sincerely believing that they are not directing them. Finally, a\ngreat deal of attention has been given to the work of neuroscientist\nBenjamin Libet (2002). Libet conducted some simple experiments that\nseemed to reveal the existence of ‘preparatory’ brain\nactivity shortly before a subject engages in an ostensibly spontaneous\naction. (Libet interpreted this activity as the brain’s\n‘deciding’ what to do before we are consciously settled on\na course of action.) Wegner (2001) surveys all of these findings (some\nof which are due to his own work as a social psychologist) and argues\non their basis that the experience of conscious willing is ‘an\nillusion’. For criticism of such arguments, see Mele (2009),\nO’Connor (2009c), and Nahmias (2014). \n\nWhile Pereboom and others point to these empirical considerations in\ndefense of free will skepticism, other philosophers see them as\nreasons to favor a more modest free will agnosticism (Kearns 2015) or\nto promote revisionism about the ‘folk idea of free will’\n(Vargas 2013; Nichols 2015). \n\nIf one is a compatibilist, then a case for the reality of free will\nrequires evidence for our being effective agents who for the most part\nare aware of what we do and why we are doing it. If one is an\nincompatibilist, then the case requires in addition evidence\nfor causal indeterminism, occurring in the right locations in the\nprocess leading from deliberation to action. Many think that we\nalready have third-personal ‘neutral’ scientific evidence\nfor much of human behavior’s satisfying modest compatibilist\nrequirements, such as Fischer and Ravizza’s\nreasons-responsiveness account. However, given the immaturity of\nsocial science and the controversy over whether psychological states\n‘reduce’ in some sense to underlying physical states (and\nwhat this might entail for the reality of mental causation), this\nclaim is doubtful. A more promising case for our satisfying (at least)\ncompatibilist requirements on freedom is that effective agency\nis presupposed by all scientific inquiry and so cannot\nrationally be doubted (which fact is overlooked by some of the more\nextreme ‘willusionists’ such as Wegner). \n\nHowever, effective intervention in the world (in scientific practice\nand elsewhere) does not (obviously) require that our behavior be\ncausally undetermined, so the ‘freedom is rationally\npresupposed’ argument cannot be launched for such an\nunderstanding of freedom. Instead, incompatibilists usually give one\nof the following two bases for rational belief in freedom (both of\nwhich can be given by compatibilists, too). \n\nFirst, philosophers have long claimed that we have introspective\nevidence of freedom in our experience of action, or perhaps of\nconsciously attended or deliberated action. Augustine and Scotus,\ndiscussed earlier, are two examples among many. In recent years,\nphilosophers have been more carefully scrutinizing the experience of\nagency and a debate has emerged concerning its contents, and in\nparticular whether it supports an indeterministic theory of human free\naction. For discussion, see Deery et al. (2013), Guillon (2014), Horgan\n(2015), and Bayne (2017). \n\nSecond, philosophers (e.g., Reid 1788 [1969], Swinburne 2013)\nsometimes claim that our belief in the reality of free will is\nepistemically basic, or reasonable without requiring independent\nevidential support. Most philosophers hold that some beliefs have that\nstatus, on pain of our having no justified beliefs whatever. It is\ncontroversial, however, just which beliefs do because it is\ncontroversial which criteria a belief must satisfy to qualify for that\nprivileged status. It is perhaps necessary that a basic belief be\n‘instinctive’ (unreflectively held) for all or most human\nbeings; that it be embedded in regular experience; and that it be\ncentral to our understanding of an important aspect of the world. Our\nbelief in free will seems to meet these criteria, but whether they are\nsufficient will be debated. Other philosophers defend a variation on\nthis stance, maintaining instead that belief in the reality of moral\nresponsibility is epistemically basic, and that since moral\nresponsibility entails free will, or so it is claimed, we may\ninfer the reality of free will (see, e.g., van Inwagen 1983,\n206–13). \n\nA large portion of Western philosophical work on free will has been\nwritten within an overarching theological framework, according to\nwhich God is the ultimate source, sustainer, and end of all else. Some\nof these thinkers draw the conclusion that God must be a sufficient,\nwholly determining cause for everything that happens; all of them\nsuppose that every creaturely act necessarily depends on the\nexplanatorily prior, cooperative activity of God. It is also commonly\npresumed by philosophical theists that human beings are free and\nresponsible (on pain of attributing evil in the world to God alone,\nand so impugning His perfect goodness). Hence, those who believe that\nGod is omni-determining typically are compatibilists with respect to\nfreedom and (in this case) theological determinism. Edwards (1754\n[1957]) is a good example. But those who suppose that God’s\nsustaining activity (and special activity of conferring grace) is only\na necessary condition on the outcome of human free choices need to\ntell a more subtle story, on which omnipotent God’s cooperative\nactivity can be (explanatorily) prior to a human choice and yet the\noutcome of that choice be settled only by the choice itself. For\nimportant medieval discussions—the apex of philosophical\nreflection on theological concerns—see the relevant portions of\nAl-Ghazali IP, Aquinas BW and Scotus QAM.\nThree positions (given in order of logical strength) on God’s\nactivity vis-à-vis creaturely activity were variously defended\nby thinkers of this area: mere conservationism, concurrentism, and\noccasionalism. These positions turn on subtle distinctions, which have\nrecently been explored by Freddoso (1988), Kvanvig and McCann (1991),\nGrant (2016), and Judisch (2016). \n\nMany suppose that there is a challenge to human freedom stemming not\nonly from God’s perfect power but also from his perfect\nknowledge. A standard argument for the incompatibility of free will\nand causal determinism has a close theological analogue. Recall van\nInwagen’s influential formulation of the ‘Consequence\nArgument’: \n\nIf determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws\nof nature and events in the remote past. But it is not up to us what\nwent on before we were born, and neither is it up to us what the laws\nof nature are. Therefore, the consequences of these things (including\nour present acts) are not up to us. (van Inwagen 1983, 16) \n\nAnd now consider an argument that turns on God’s comprehensive\nand infallible knowledge of the future: \nIf infallible divine foreknowledge is true, then our acts are the\n(logical) consequences of God’s beliefs in the remote past.\n(Since God cannot get things wrong, his believing that\nsomething will be so entails that it will be so.) But it is not up to\nus what beliefs God had before we were born, and neither is it up to\nus that God’s beliefs are necessarily true. Therefore, the\nconsequences of these things (including our present acts) are not up\nto us. \n\nAn excellent discussion of these arguments in tandem and attempts to\npoint to relevant disanalogies between causal determinism and\ninfallible foreknowledge may be found in the introduction to Fischer\n(1989). See also the entry on\n foreknowledge and free will.\n  \n\nAnother issue concerns how knowledge of God, the ultimate Good, would\nimpact human freedom. Many philosophical theologians, especially the\nmedieval Aristotelians, were drawn to the idea that human beings\ncannot but will that which they take to be an unqualified good. (As\nnoted above, Duns Scotus is an exception to this consensus, as were\nOckham and Suarez subsequently, but their dissent is limited.) Hence,\nif there is an afterlife, in which humans ‘see God face to\nface,’ they will inevitably be drawn to Him. Following\nPascal, Murray (1993, 2002) argues that a good God would choose to\nmake His existence and character less than certain for human beings,\nfor the sake of preserving their freedom. (He will do so, the argument\ngoes, at least for a period of time in which human beings participate\nin their own character formation.) If it is a good for human beings\nthat they freely choose to respond in love to God and to act in\nobedience to His will, then God must maintain an ‘epistemic\ndistance’ from them lest they be overwhelmed by His goodness or\npower and respond out of necessity, rather than freedom. (See also the\nother essays in Howard-Snyder and Moser 2002.) \n\nIf it is true that God withholds our ability to be certain of his\nexistence for the sake of our freedom, then it is natural to conclude\nthat humans will lack freedom in heaven. And it is anyways common to\ntraditional Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theologies to maintain that\nhumans cannot sin in heaven. Even so, traditional Christian theology\nat least maintains that human persons in heaven are free. What sort of\nfreedom is in view here, and how does it relate to mundane freedom?\nTwo good recent discussions of these questions are Pawl and Timpe\n(2009) and Tamburro (2017). \n\nFinally, there is the question of the freedom of God himself.  Perfect\ngoodness is an essential, not acquired, attribute of God. God cannot\nlie or be in any way immoral in His dealings with His creatures\n(appearances notwithstanding). Unless we take the minority position on\nwhich this is a trivial claim, since whatever God does\ndefinitionally counts as good, this appears to be a\nsignificant, inner constraint on God’s freedom. Did we not\ncontemplate immediately above that human freedom would be curtailed by\nour having an unmistakable awareness of what is in fact the Good? And\nyet is it not passing strange to suppose that God should be less than\nperfectly free? \n\nOne suggested solution to this puzzle takes as its point of departure\nthe distinction noted in section 2.3 between the ability to do\notherwise and sourcehood, proposing that the core metaphysical feature\nof freedom is being the ultimate source, or originator, of one’s\nchoices. For human beings or any created persons who owe their\nexistence to factors outside themselves, the only way their acts of\nwill could find their ultimate origin in themselves is for such acts\nnot to be determined by their character and circumstances. For if all\nmy willings were wholly determined, then if we were to trace my causal\nhistory back far enough, we would ultimately arrive at external\nfactors that gave rise to me, with my particular genetic\ndispositions. My motives at the time would not be\nthe ultimate source of my willings, only the\nmost proximate ones. Only by there being less than\ndeterministic connections between external influences and choices,\nthen, is it be possible for me to be an ultimate source of my\nactivity, concerning which I may truly say, “the buck stops\nhere.” \n\nAs is generally the case, things are different on this point in the\ncase of God. As Anselm observed, even if God's character absolutely\nprecludes His performing certain actions in certain contexts, this\nwill not imply that some external factor is in any way a partial\norigin of His willings and refrainings from willing. Indeed, this\nwould not be so even if he were determined by character to\nwill everything which He wills. God’s nature owes its\nexistence to nothing. Thus, God would be the sole and ultimate source\nof His will even if He couldn’t will otherwise. \n\nWell, then, might God have willed otherwise in any respect?\nThe majority view in the history of philosophical theology is that He\nindeed could have. He might have chosen not to create anything at all.\nAnd given that He did create, He might have created any number of\nalternatives to what we observe. But there have been noteworthy\nthinkers who argued the contrary position, along with others who\nclearly felt the pull of the contrary position even while resisting\nit.  The most famous such thinker is Leibniz (1710 [1985]), who argued\nthat God, being both perfectly good and perfectly powerful, cannot\nfail to will the best possible world. Leibniz insisted that this is\nconsistent with saying that God is able to will otherwise, although\nhis defense of this last claim is notoriously difficult to make out\nsatisfactorily.  Many read Leibniz, malgré lui, as one\nwhose basic commitments imply that God could not have willed other\nthan He does in any respect. \n\nOne might challenge Leibniz’s reasoning on this point by\nquestioning the assumption that there is a uniquely best possible\nCreation (an option noted by Adams 1987, though he challenges instead\nLeibniz’s conclusion based on it). One way this could be is if\nthere is no well-ordering of worlds: some pairs of worlds are\nsufficiently different in kind that they are incommensurate with each\nother (neither is better than the other, nor are they equal) and no\nworld is better than either of them. Another way this could be is if\nthere is no upper limit on goodness of worlds: for every possible\nworld God might have created, there are others (infinitely many, in\nfact) which are better. If such is the case, one might argue, it is\nreasonable for God to arbitrarily choose which world to create from\namong those worlds exceeding some threshold value of overall\ngoodness. \n\nHowever, William Rowe (2004) has countered that the thesis that there\nis no upper limit on goodness of worlds has a very different\nconsequence: it shows that there could not be a morally perfect\nCreator! For suppose our world has an on-balance moral value of \\(n\\)\nand that God chose to create it despite being aware of possibilities\nhaving values higher than \\(n\\) that He was able to create. It seems\nwe can now imagine a morally better Creator: one having the same\noptions who chooses to create a better world. For critical replies to\nRowe, see Almeida (2008, ch. 1), O’Connor (2008), and Kray\n(2010). \n\nFinally, Norman Kretzmann (1997, 220–25) has argued in the\ncontext of Aquinas’s theological system that there is strong\npressure to say that God must have created something or other, though\nit may well have been open to Him to create any of a number of\ncontingent orders. The reason is that there is no plausible account of\nhow an absolutely perfect God might have a resistible\nmotivation—one consideration among other, competing\nconsiderations—for creating something rather than nothing. (It\nobviously cannot have to do with any sort of utility, for example.)\nThe best general understanding of God’s being motivated to\ncreate at all—one which in places Aquinas himself comes very\nclose to endorsing—is to see it as reflecting the fact that\nGod’s very being, which is goodness, necessarily diffuses\nitself. Perfect goodness will naturally communicate itself outwardly;\nGod who is perfect goodness will naturally create, generating a\ndependent reality that imperfectly reflects that goodness. Wainwright\n(1996) discusses a somewhat similar line of thought in the Puritan\nthinker Jonathan Edwards. Alexander Pruss (2016), however, raises\nsubstantial grounds for doubt concerning this line of thought.","contact.mail":"cefranklin@gcc.edu","contact.domain":"gcc.edu"}]
