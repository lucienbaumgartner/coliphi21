But the\nlabel is usually applied much more broadly to any view explicitly\nembracing the idea that truth consists in a relation to reality, i.e.,\nthat truth is a relational property involving a characteristic\nrelation (to be specified) to some portion of reality (to be\nspecified). This basic idea has been expressed in many ways, giving\nrise to an extended family of theories and, more often, theory\nsketches. Members of the family employ various concepts for the\nrelevant relation (correspondence, conformity, congruence, agreement,\naccordance, copying, picturing, signification, representation,\nreference, satisfaction) and/or various concepts for the relevant\nportion of reality (facts, states of affairs, conditions, situations,\nevents, objects, sequences of objects, sets, properties, tropes). The\nresulting multiplicity of versions and reformulations of the theory is\ndue to a blend of substantive and terminological differences.\n\n\n\nThe correspondence theory of truth is often associated with\nmetaphysical realism. Its traditional competitors, pragmatist, as well\nas coherentist, verificationist, and other epistemic theories of\ntruth, are often associated with idealism, anti-realism, or\nrelativism. In recent years, these traditional competitors have been\nvirtually replaced (at least from publication-space) by deflationary\ntheories of truth and, to a lesser extent, by the identity theory\n(note that these new competitors are typically not associated\nwith anti-realism). Still more recently, two further approaches have\nreceived considerable attention. One is truthmaker theory: it is\nsometimes viewed as a competitor to, sometimes as a more liberal\nversion of, the correspondence theory. The other is pluralism: it\nincorporates a correspondence account as one, but only one, ingredient\nof its overall account of truth.\n\n\n\nThe correspondence theory is often traced back to Aristotle’s\nwell-known definition of truth (Metaphysics 1011b25):\n“To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is,\nis false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that\nit is not, is true”—but virtually identical formulations\ncan be found in Plato (Cratylus 385b2, Sophist\n263b). It is noteworthy that this definition does not highlight the\nbasic correspondence intuition. Although it does allude to a relation\n(saying something of something) to reality (what\nis), the relation is not made very explicit, and there is no\nspecification of what on the part of reality is responsible for the\ntruth of a saying. As such, the definition offers a muted, relatively\nminimal version of a correspondence theory. (For this reason it has\nalso been claimed as a precursor of deflationary theories of truth.)\nAristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in\nthe Categories (12b11, 14b14), where he talks of underlying\nthings that make statements true and implies that these things\n(pragmata) are logically structured situations or facts\n(viz., his sitting and his not sitting are said to\nunderlie the statements “He is sitting” and “He is\nnot sitting”, respectively). Most influential is\nAristotle’s claim in De Interpretatione (16a3) that\nthoughts are “likenesses” (homoiomata) of\nthings. Although he nowhere defines truth in terms of a\nthought’s likeness to a thing or fact, it is clear that such a\ndefinition would fit well into his overall philosophy of\nmind. (Cf. Crivelli 2004; Szaif 2006.) \n\nIn medieval authors we find a division between\n“metaphysical” and “semantic” versions of the\ncorrespondence theory. The former are indebted to the\ntruth-as-likeness theme suggested by Aristotle’s overall views,\nthe latter are modeled on Aristotle’s more austere definition\nfrom Metaphysics 1011b25. \n\nThe metaphysical version presented by Thomas Aquinas is the\nbest known: “Veritas est adaequatio rei et\nintellectus” (Truth is the equation of thing and\nintellect), which he restates as: “A judgment is said to be true\nwhen it conforms to the external reality”. He tends to use\n“conformitas” and\n“adaequatio”, but also uses\n“correspondentia”, giving the latter a more\ngeneric sense (De Veritate, Q.1, A.1-3; cf. Summa\nTheologiae, Q.16). Aquinas credits the Neoplatonist Isaac Israeli\nwith this definition, but there is no such definition in\nIsaac. Correspondence formulations can be traced back to the Academic\nskeptic Carneades, 2nd century B.C., whom Sextus Empiricus\n(Adversos Mathematicos, vii, 168) reports as having taught\nthat a presentation “is true when it is in accord\n(symphonos) with the object presented, and false when it is\nin discord with it”. Similar accounts can be found in various\nearly commentators on Plato and Aristotle (cf. Künne 2003,\nchap. 3.1), including some Neoplatonists: Proklos (In Tim.,\nII 287, 1) speaks of truth as the agreement or adjustment\n(epharmoge) between knower and the known. Philoponus (In\nCat., 81, 25-34) emphasizes that truth is neither in the things\nor states of affairs (pragmata) themselves, nor in the\nstatement itself, but lies in the agreement between the two. He gives\nthe simile of the fitting shoe, the fit consisting in a relation\nbetween shoe and foot, not to be found in either one by itself. Note\nthat his emphasis on the relation as opposed to its relata is laudable\nbut potentially misleading, because x’s truth (its being\ntrue) is not to be identified with a relation, R, between x\nand y, but with a general relational property of x,\ntaking the form (∃y)(xRy &\nFy). Further early correspondence formulations can be found in\nAvicenna (Metaphysica, 1.8-9) and Averroes (Tahafut,\n103, 302). They were introduced to the scholastics by William of\nAuxerre, who may have been the intended recipient of Aquinas’\nmistaken attribution (cf. Boehner 1958; Wolenski 1994). \n\nAquinas’ balanced formula “equation of thing and\nintellect” is intended to leave room for the idea that\n“true” can be applied not only to thoughts and judgments\nbut also to things or persons (e.g. a true friend). Aquinas explains\nthat a thought is said to be true because it conforms to\nreality, whereas a thing or person is said to be true because\nit conforms to a thought (a friend is true insofar as, and because,\nshe conforms to our, or God’s, conception of what a friend ought\nto be). Medieval theologians regarded both, judgment-truth as well as\nthing/person-truth, as somehow flowing from, or grounded in, the\ndeepest truth which, according to the Bible, is God: “I am the\nway and the truth and the life” (John 14, 6). Their attempts to\nintegrate this Biblical passage with more ordinary thinking involving\ntruth gave rise to deep metaphysico-theological reflections. The\nnotion of thing/person-truth, which thus played a very important role\nin medieval thinking, is disregarded by modern and contemporary\nanalytic philosophers but survives to some extent in existentialist\nand continental philosophy. \n\nMedieval authors who prefer a semantic version of the\ncorrespondence theory often use a peculiarly truncated formula to\nrender Aristotle’s definition: A (mental) sentence is true if\nand only if, as it signifies, so it is (sicut significat, ita\nest). This emphasizes the semantic relation\nof signification while remaining maximally elusive about what\nthe “it” is that is signified by a true sentence and\nde-emphasizing the correspondence relation (putting it into the little\nwords “as” and “so”). Foreshadowing a favorite\napproach of the 20th century, medieval semanticists like Ockham\n(Summa Logicae, II) and Buridan (Sophismata, II)\ngive exhaustive lists of different truth-conditional clauses for\nsentences of different grammatical categories. They refrain from\nassociating true sentences in general with items from a single\nontological category. (Cf. Moody 1953; Adams McCord 1987; Perler\n2006.) \n\nAuthors of the modern period generally convey the impression that the\ncorrespondence theory of truth is far too obvious to merit much, or\nany, discussion. Brief statements of some version or other can be\nfound in almost all major writers; see e.g.: Descartes 1639, ATII 597;\nSpinoza, Ethics, axiom vi; Locke, Essay, 4.5.1;\nLeibniz, New Essays, 4.5.2; Hume, Treatise, 3.1.1;\nand Kant 1787, B82. Berkeley, who does not seem to offer any account\nof truth, is a potentially significant exception. Due to the influence\nof Thomism, metaphysical versions of the theory are much more popular\nwith the moderns than semantic versions. But since the moderns\ngenerally subscribe to a representational theory of the mind (the\ntheory of ideas), they would seem to be ultimately committed to\nspelling out relations like correspondence or conformity in terms of a\npsycho-semantic representation relation holding between ideas, or\nsentential sequences of ideas (Locke’s “mental\npropositions”), and appropriate portions of reality, thereby\neffecting a merger between metaphysical and semantic versions of the\ncorrespondence theory. \n\nIt is helpful to distinguish between “object-based” and\n“fact-based” versions of correspondence theories,\ndepending on whether the corresponding portion of reality is said to\nbe an object or a fact (cf. Künne 2003, chap. 3). \n\nTraditional versions of object-based theories assumed that\nthe truth-bearing items (usually taken to be judgments) have\nsubject-predicate structure. An object-based definition of truth might\nlook like this: \n\nNote that this actually involves two relations to an object:\n(i) a reference relation, holding between the subject term of the\njudgment and the object the judgment is about (its object);\nand (ii) a correspondence relation, holding between the predicate term\nof the judgment and a property of the object. Owing to its reliance on\nthe subject-predicate structure of truth-bearing items, the account\nsuffers from an inherent limitation: it does not cover truthbearers\nthat lack subject-predicate structure (e.g. conditionals,\ndisjunctions), and it is not clear how the account might be extended\nto cover them. The problem is obvious and serious; it was nevertheless\nsimply ignored in most writings. Object-based correspondence was the\nnorm until relatively recently. \n\nObject-based correspondence became the norm through Plato’s\npivotal engagement with the problem of falsehood, which was\napparently notorious at its time. In a number of dialogues, Plato\ncomes up against an argument, advanced by various Sophists, to the\neffect that false judgment is impossible—roughly: To judge\nfalsely is to judge what is not. But one cannot judge what is\nnot, for it is not there to be judged. To judge something that is not\nis to judge nothing, hence, not to judge at all. Therefore, false\njudgment is impossible. (Cf. Euthydemus\n283e-288a; Cratylus 429c-e; Republic\n478a-c; Theaetetus 188d-190e.) Plato has no good answer to\nthis patent absurdity until the Sophist (236d-264b), where he\nfinally confronts the issue at length. The key step in his solution is\nthe analysis of truthbearers as structured complexes. A simple\nsentence, such as “Theaetetus sits.”, though simple as a\nsentence, is still a complex whole consisting of words of different\nkinds—a name (onoma) and a verb\n(rhema)—having different functions. By weaving together\nverbs with names the speaker does not just name a number of things,\nbut accomplishes something: meaningful speech (logos)\nexpressive of the interweaving of ideas (eidon\nsymploken). The simple sentence is true when Theaetetus, the\nperson named by the name, is in the state of sitting, ascribed to him\nthrough the verb, and false, when Theaetetus is not in that state but\nin another one (cf. 261c-263d; see Denyer 1991; Szaif\n1998). Only things that are show up in this account: in the\ncase of falsehood, the ascribed state still is, but it is a state\ndifferent from the one Theaetetus is in. The account is extended from\nspeech to thought and belief via Plato’s well known thesis that\n“thought is speech that occurs without voice, inside the soul in\nconversation with itself” (263e)—the historical origin of\nthe language-of-thought hypothesis. The account does not take into\nconsideration sentences that contain a name of something that is not\n(“Pegasus flies”), thus bequeathing to posterity a\nresidual problem that would become more notorious than the problem of\nfalsehood. \n\nAristotle, in De Interpretatione, adopts Plato’s\naccount without much ado—indeed, the beginning of De\nInterpretatione reads like a direct continuation of the passages\nfrom the Sophist mentioned above. He emphasizes that truth\nand falsehood have to do with combination and separation (cf. De\nInt. 16a10; in De Anima 430a25, he says: “where\nthe alternative of true and false applies, there we always find a sort\nof combining of objects of thought in a quasi-unity”). Unlike\nPlato, Aristotle feels the need to characterize simple affirmative and\nnegative statements (predications) separately—translating rather\nmore literally than is usual: “An affirmation is a predication\nof something toward something, a negation is a predication of\nsomething away from something” (De Int. 17a25). This\ncharacterization reappears early in the Prior Analytics\n(24a). It thus seems fair to say that the subject-predicate analysis\nof simple declarative sentences—the most basic feature of\nAristotelian term logic which was to reign supreme for many\ncenturies—had its origin in Plato’s response to a\nsophistical argument against the possibility of falsehood. One may\nnote that Aristotle’s famous definition of truth (see Section 1)\nactually begins with the definition of falsehood. \n\nFact-based correspondence theories became prominent only in\nthe 20th century, though one can find remarks in Aristotle that fit\nthis approach (see Section 1)—somewhat surprisingly in light of\nhis repeated emphasis on subject-predicate structure wherever truth\nand falsehood are concerned. Fact-based theories do not presuppose\nthat the truth-bearing items have subject-predicate structure; indeed,\nthey can be stated without any explicit reference to the structure of\ntruth-bearing items. The approach thus embodies an alternative\nresponse to the problem of falsehood, a response that may claim to\nextricate the theory of truth from the limitations imposed on it\nthrough the presupposition of subject-predicate structure inherited\nfrom the response to the problem of falsehood favored by Plato,\nAristotle, and the medieval and modern tradition. \n\nThe now classical formulation of a fact-based correspondence theory\nwas foreshadowed by Hume (Treatise, 3.1.1) and Mill\n(Logic, 1.5.1). It appears in its canonical form early in the\n20th century in Moore (1910-11, chap. 15) and Russell: “Thus a\nbelief is true when there is a corresponding fact, and is false when\nthere is no corresponding fact” (1912, p. 129; cf. also his\n1905, 1906, 1910, and 1913). The self-conscious emphasis\non facts as the corresponding portions of reality—and a\nmore serious concern with problems raised by\nfalsehood—distinguishes this version from its\nforeshadowings. Russell and Moore’s forceful advocacy of truth\nas correspondence to a fact was, at the time, an integral part of\ntheir defense of metaphysical realism. Somewhat ironically, their\nformulations are indebted to their idealist opponents, F. H. Bradley\n(1883, chaps. 1&2), and H. H. Joachim (1906), the latter was an\nearly advocate of the competing coherence theory, who had set up a\ncorrespondence-to-fact account of truth as the main target of his\nattack on realism. Later, Wittgenstein (1921) and Russell (1918)\ndeveloped “logical atomism”, which introduces an important\nmodification of the fact-based correspondence approach (see below,\nSection 7.1). Further modifications of the correspondence theory,\nbringing a return to more overtly semantic and broadly object-based\nversions, were influenced by Tarski’s (1935) technical work on\ntruth (cf. Field 1972, Popper 1972). \n\nCorrespondence theories of truth have been given for beliefs,\nthoughts, ideas, judgments, statements, assertions, utterances,\nsentences, and propositions. It has become customary to talk\nof truthbearers whenever one wants to stay neutral between\nthese choices. Five points should be kept in mind: \n\nTalk of truthmakers serves a function similar, but\ncorrelative, to talk of truthbearers. A truthmaker is anything that\nmakes some truthbearer true. Different versions of the correspondence\ntheory will have different, and often competing, views about what sort\nof items true truthbearers correspond to (facts, states of affairs,\nevents, things, tropes, properties). It is convenient to talk of\ntruthmakers whenever one wants to stay neutral between these\nchoices. Four points should be kept in mind: \n\nThe abstract noun “truth” has various uses. (a)\nIt can be used to refer to the general relational property\notherwise referred to as being true; though the latter label\nwould be more perspicuous, it is rarely used, even in philosophical\ndiscussions. (b) The noun “truth” can be used to\nrefer to the concept that “picks out” the\nproperty and is expressed in English by the adjective\n“true”. Some authors do not distinguish between concept\nand property; others do, or should: an account of the concept might\ndiffer significantly from an account of the property. To mention just\none example, one might maintain, with some plausibility, that an\naccount of the concept ought to succumb to the liar paradox\n(see the entry on the liar paradox),\notherwise it wouldn’t be an adequate account of our\nconcept of truth; this idea is considerably less plausible in the case\nof the property. Any proposed “definition of truth” might\nbe intend as a definition of the property or of the concept or both;\nits author may or may not be alive to the difference. (c) The\nnoun “truth” can be used, finally, to refer to some set of\ntrue truthbarers (possibly unknown), as in: “The truth is out\nthere”, and: “The truth about this matter will never be\nknown”. \n\nThe traditional centerpiece of any correspondence theory is a\ndefinition of truth. Nowadays, a correspondence definition is most\nlikely intended as a “real definition”, i.e., as a\ndefinition of the property, which does not commit its advocate to the\nclaim that the definition provides a synonym for the term\n“true”. Most correspondence theorists would consider it\nimplausible and unnecessarily bold to maintain that\n“true” means the same as “corresponds with\na fact”. Some simple forms of correspondence definitions of\ntruth should be distinguished (“iff” means “if and\nonly if”; the variable, “x”, ranges over\nwhatever truthbearers are taken as primary; the notion of\ncorrespondence might be replaced by various related notions): \n\nBoth forms invoke portions of reality—facts/states of\naffairs—that are typically denoted by that-clauses or by\nsentential gerundives, viz. the fact/state of affairs that snow is\nwhite, or the fact/state of affairs of snow’s being\nwhite. (2)’s definition of falsehood is committed to there\nbeing (existing) entities of this sort that nevertheless fail to\nobtain, such as snow’s being green. (1)’s\ndefinition of falsehood is not so committed: to say that a fact does\nnot obtain means, at best, that there is no such fact, that no such\nfact exists. It should be noted that this terminology is not\nstandardized: some authors use “state of affairs” much\nlike “fact” is used here (e.g. Armstrong 1997). The\nquestion whether non-obtaining beings of the relevant sort are to be\naccepted is the substantive issue behind such terminological\nvariations. The difference between (2) and (1) is akin to the\ndifference between Platonism about properties (embraces uninstantiated\nproperties) and Aristotelianism about properties (rejects\nuninstantiated properties). \n\nAdvocates of (2) hold that facts are states of affairs that\nobtain, i.e., they hold that their account of truth is in effect an\nanalysis of (1)’s account of truth. So disagreement turns\nlargely on the treatment of falsehood, which (1) simply identifies\nwith the absence of truth. \n\nThe following points might be made for preferring (2) over (1):\n(a) Form (2) does not imply that things outside the category\nof truthbearers (tables, dogs) are false just because they don’t\ncorrespond to any facts. One might think this “flaw” of\n(1) is easily repaired: just put an explicit specification of the\ndesired category of truthbearers into both sides of (1). However, some\nworry that truthbearer categories, e.g. declarative sentences or\npropositions, cannot be defined without invoking truth and falsehood,\nwhich would make the resultant definition implicitly\ncircular. (b) Form (2) allows for items within the category\nof truthbearers that are neither true nor false, i.e., it allows for\nthe failure of bivalence. Some, though not all, will regard this as a\nsignificant advantage. (c) If the primary truthbearers are\nsentences or mental states, then states of affairs could be their\nmeanings or contents, and the correspondence relation in (2) could be\nunderstood accordingly, as the relation of representation,\nsignification, meaning, or having-as-content. Facts, on the other\nhand, cannot be identified with the meanings or contents of sentences\nor mental states, on pain of the absurd consequence that false\nsentences and beliefs have no meaning or content. (d) Take a\ntruth of the form ‘p or q’, where\n‘p’ is true and ‘q’\nfalse. What are the constituents of the corresponding fact? Since\n‘q’ is false, they cannot both be facts\n(cf. Russell 1906-07, p. 47f.). Form (2) allows that the fact\ncorresponding to ‘p or q’ is an\nobtaining disjunctive state of affairs composed of a state of affairs\nthat obtains and a state of affairs that does not obtain. \n\nThe main point in favor of (1) over (2) is that (1) is not committed\nto counting non-obtaining states of affairs, like the state of affairs\nthat snow is green, as constituents of reality. \n\n(One might observe that, strictly speaking, (1) and (2), being\nbiconditionals, are not ontologically committed to anything. Their\nrespective commitments to facts and states of affairs arise only when\nthey are combined with claims to the effect that there is something\nthat is true and something that is false. The discussion assumes some\nsuch claims as given.) \n\nBoth forms, (1) and (2), should be distinguished from: \n\nwhich is a confused version of (1), or a confused version of (2), or,\nif unconfused, signals commitment to Meinongianism, i.e., the thesis\nthat there are things/facts that do not exist. The lure of (3) stems\nfrom the desire to offer more than a purely negative correspondence\naccount of falsehood while avoiding commitment to non-obtaining states\nof affairs. Moore at times succumbs to (3)’s temptations\n(1910-11, pp. 267 & 269, but see p. 277). It can also be found in\nthe 1961 translation of Wittgenstein (1921, 4.25), who uses\n“state of affairs” (Sachverhalt) to refer to\n(atomic) facts. The translation has Wittgenstein saying that an\nelementary proposition is false, when the corresponding state of\naffairs (atomic fact) does not exist—but the German original of\nthe same passage looks rather like a version of (2). Somewhat\nironically, a definition of form (3) reintroduces Plato’s\nproblem of falsehood into a fact-based correspondence theory, i.e.,\ninto a theory of the sort that was supposed to provide an alternative\nsolution to that very problem (see Section 1.2). \n\nA fourth simple form of correspondence definition was popular for a\ntime (cf. Russell 1918, secs. 1 & 3; Broad 1933, IV.2.23; Austin\n1950, fn. 23), but seems to have fallen out of favor: \n\nThis formulation attempts to avoid (2)’s commitment to\nnon-obtaining states of affairs and (3)’s commitment to\nnon-existent facts by invoking the relation of mis-correspondence, or\ndisagreement, to account for falsehood. It differs from (1) in that it\nattempts to keep items outside the intended category\nof x’s from being false: supposedly, tables and dogs\ncannot mis-correspond with a fact. Main worries about (4) are:\n(a) its invocation of an additional, potentially mysterious,\nrelation, which (b) seems difficult to tame: Which fact is\nthe one that mis-corresponds with a given falsehood?  and: What keeps\na truth, which by definition corresponds with some fact, from also\nmis-corresponding with some other fact, i.e., from being a falsehood\nas well? \n\nIn the following, I will treat definitions (1) and (2) as\nparadigmatic; moreover, since advocates of (2) agree that obtaining\nstates of affairs are facts, it is often convenient to\ncondense the correspondence theory into the simpler formula provided\nby (1), “truth is correspondence to a fact”, at least as\nlong as one is not particularly concerned with issues raised by\nfalsehood. \n\nThe main positive argument given by advocates of the correspondence\ntheory of truth is its obviousness. Descartes: “I have never had\nany doubts about truth, because it seems a notion so transcendentally\nclear that nobody can be ignorant of it...the word\n‘truth’, in the strict sense, denotes the conformity of\nthought with its object” (1639, AT II 597). Even philosophers\nwhose overall views may well lead one to expect otherwise tend to\nagree. Kant: “The nominal definition of truth, that it is the\nagreement of [a cognition] with its object, is assumed as\ngranted” (1787, B82). William James: “Truth, as any\ndictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of our ideas. It\nmeans their ‘agreement’, as falsity means their\ndisagreement, with ‘reality’” (1907,\np. 96). Indeed, The Oxford English Dictionary tells us:\n“Truth, n. Conformity with fact; agreement with\nreality”. \n\nIn view of its claimed obviousness, it would seem interesting to learn\nhow popular the correspondence theory actually is. There are some\nempirical data. The PhilPapers Survey (conducted in 2009;\ncf. Bourget and Chalmers 2014), more specifically, the part of the\nsurvey targeting all regular faculty members in 99 leading departments\nof philosophy, reports the following responses to the question:\n“Truth: correspondence, deflationary, or epistemic?”\nAccept or lean toward: correspondence 50.8%; deflationary 24.8%; other\n17.5%; epistemic 6.9%. The data suggest that correspondence-type\ntheories may enjoy a weak majority among professional philosophers and\nthat the opposition is divided. This fits with the observation that\ntypically, discussions of the nature of truth take some version of the\ncorrespondence theory as the default view, the view to be criticized\nor to be defended against criticism. \n\nHistorically, the correspondence theory, usually in an object-based\nversion, was taken for granted, so much so that it did not acquire\nthis name until comparatively recently, and explicit arguments for the\nview are very hard to find. Since the (comparatively recent) arrival\nof apparently competing approaches, correspondence theorists have\ndeveloped negative arguments, defending their view against objections\nand attacking (sometimes ridiculing) competing views. \n\nObjection 1: Definitions like (1) or (2) are\ntoo narrow. Although they apply to truths from some domains of\ndiscourse, e.g., the domain of science, they fail for others, e.g.\nthe domain of morality: there are no moral facts. \n\nThe objection recognizes moral truths, but rejects the idea that\nreality contains moral facts for moral truths to correspond to. Logic\nprovides another example of a domain that has been\n“flagged” in this way. The logical positivists recognized\nlogical truths but rejected logical facts. Their intellectual\nancestor, Hume, had already given two definitions of\n“true”, one for logical truths, broadly conceived, the\nother for non-logical truths: “Truth or falsehood consists in an\nagreement or disagreement either to the real relations of\nideas, or to real existence and matter of fact”\n(Hume, Treatise, 3.1.1, cf. 2.3.10; see also\nLocke, Essay, 4.5.6, for a similarly two-pronged account but\nin terms of object-based correspondence). \n\nThere are four possible responses to objections of this sort:\n(a) Noncognitivism, which says that, despite appearances to\nthe contrary, claims from the flagged domain are not truth-evaluable\nto begin with, e.g., moral claims are commands or expressions of\nemotions disguised as truthbearers; (b) Error theory, which\nsays that all claims from the flagged domain are false; (c)\nReductionism, which says that truths from the flagged domain\ncorrespond to facts of a different domain regarded as unproblematic,\ne.g., moral truths correspond to social-behavioral facts, logical\ntruths correspond to facts about linguistic conventions; and\n(d) Standing firm, i.e., embracing facts of the flagged\ndomain. \n\nThe objection in effect maintains that there are different brands\nof truth (of the property being true, not just\ndifferent brands of truths) for different domains. On the face of it,\nthis conflicts with the observation that there are many obviously\nvalid arguments combining premises from flagged and unflagged\ndomains. The observation is widely regarded as refuting\nnon-cognitivism, once the most popular (concessive) response to the\nobjection. \n\nIn connection with this objection, one should take note of the\nrecently developed “multiple realizability” view of truth,\naccording to which truth is not to be identified\nwith correspondence to fact but can be realized by\ncorrespondence to fact for truthbearers of some domains of discourse\nand by other properties for truthbearers of other domains of\ndiscourse, including “flagged” domains. Though it retains\nimportant elements of the correspondence theory, this view does not,\nstrictly speaking, offer a response to the objection on behalf of the\ncorrespondence theory and should be regarded as one of its competitors\n(see below, Section 8.2). \n\nObjection 2: Correspondence theories are too\nobvious. They are trivial, vacuous, trading in mere platitudes.\nLocutions from the “corresponds to the facts”-family are\nused regularly in everyday language as idiomatic substitutes for\n“true”. Such common turns of phrase should not be taken to\nindicate commitment to a correspondence theory in any serious\nsense. Definitions like (1) or (2) merely condense some trivial idioms\ninto handy formulas; they don’t deserve the grand label\n“theory”: there is no theoretical weight behind them\n(cf. Woozley 1949, chap. 6; Davidson 1969; Blackburn 1984,\nchap. 7.1). \n\nIn response, one could point out: (a) Definitions like (1) or\n(2) are “mini-theories”—mini-theories are quite\ncommon in philosophy—and it is not at all obvious that they are\nvacuous merely because they are modeled on common usage. (b)\nThere are correspondence theories that go beyond these\ndefinitions. (c) The complaint implies that definitions like\n(1) and/or (2) are generally accepted and are, moreover, so shallow\nthat they are compatible with any deeper theory of truth.  This makes\nit rather difficult to explain why some thinkers emphatically reject\nall correspondence formulations. (d) The objection implies\nthat the correspondence of S’s belief with a fact could\nbe said to consist in, e.g., the belief’s coherence\nwith S’s overall belief system. This is wildly\nimplausible, even on the most shallow understanding of\n“correspondence” and “fact”. \n\nObjection 3: Correspondence theories are\ntoo obscure. \n\nObjections of this sort, which are the most common, protest that the\ncentral notions of a correspondence theory carry unacceptable\ncommitments and/or cannot be accounted for in any respectable manner.\nThe objections can be divided into objections primarily aimed at the\ncorrespondence relation and its relatives (3.C1, 3.C2), and\nobjections primarily aimed at the notions of fact\nor state of affairs (3.F1, 3.F2): \n\n3.C1: The correspondence relation must be\nsome sort of resemblance relation. But truthbearers do not resemble\nanything in the world except other truthbearers—echoing\nBerkeley’s “an idea can be like nothing but an\nidea”. \n\n3.C2: The correspondence relation is very\nmysterious: it seems to reach into the most distant regions of space\n(faster than light?) and time (past and future). How could such a\nrelation possibly be accounted for within a naturalistic framework?\nWhat physical relation could it possibly be? \n\n3.F1: Given the great variety of complex\ntruthbearers, a correspondence theory will be committed to all sorts\nof complex “funny facts” that are ontologically\ndisreputable. Negative, disjunctive, conditional, universal,\nprobabilistic, subjunctive, and counterfactual facts have all given\ncause for complaint on this score. \n\n3.F2: All facts, even the most simple ones,\nare disreputable.  Fact-talk, being wedded to that-clauses, is\nentirely parasitic on truth-talk. Facts are too much like\ntruthbearers. Facts are fictions, spurious sentence-like slices of\nreality, “projected from true sentences for the sake of\ncorrespondence” (Quine 1987, p. 213; cf.  Strawson 1950). \n\nSome correspondence theories of truth are two-liner mini-theories,\nconsisting of little more than a specific version of (1) or\n(2). Normally, one would expect a bit more, even from a philosophical\ntheory (though mini-theories are quite common in philosophy). One\nwould expect a correspondence theory to go beyond a mere definition\nlike (1) or (2) and discharge a triple task: it should tell us about\nthe workings of the correspondence relation, about the nature of\nfacts, and about the conditions that determine which truthbearers\ncorrespond to which facts. \n\nOne can approach this by considering some general principles a\ncorrespondence theory might want to add to its central principle to\nflesh out her theory. The first such principle says that the\ncorrespondence relation must not collapse into\nidentity—“It takes two to make a truth” (Austin\n1950, p. 118): \n\nIt would be much simpler to say that no truth is identical with a\nfact. However, some authors, e.g. Wittgenstein 1921, hold that a\nproposition (Satz, his truthbearer) is itself a fact, though\nnot the same fact as the one that makes the proposition true (see also\nKing 2007). Nonidentity is usually taken for granted by correspondence\ntheorists as constitutive of the very idea of a correspondence\ntheory—authors who advance contrary arguments to the effect that\ncorrespondence must collapse into identity regard their arguments as\nobjections to any form of correspondence theory (cf. Moore 1901/02,\nFrege 1918-19, p. 60). \n\nConcerning the correspondence relation, two aspects can be\ndistinguished: correspondence as correlation\nand correspondence as isomorphism (cf. Pitcher 1964; Kirkham\n1992, chap. 4). Pertaining to the first aspect, familiar from\nmathematical contexts, a correspondence theorist is likely to adopt\nclaim (a), and some may in addition adopt claim (b),\nof: \n\nTogether, (a) and (b) say that correspondence is a\none-one relation. This seems needlessly strong, and it is not easy to\nfind real-life correspondence theorists who explicitly embrace part\n(b): Why shouldn’t different truths correspond to the\nsame fact, as long as they are not too different? Explicit commitment\nto (a) is also quite rare. However, correspondence theorists\ntend to move comfortably from talk about a given truth to talk\nabout the fact it corresponds to—a move that signals\ncommitment to (a). \n\nCorrelation does not imply anything about the inner nature of the\ncorresponding items. Contrast this with correspondence\nas isomorphism, which requires the corresponding items to\nhave the same, or sufficiently similar, constituent structure. This\naspect of correspondence, which is more prominent (and more notorious)\nthan the previous one, is also much more difficult to make\nprecise. Let us say, roughly, that a correspondence theorist may want\nto add a claim to her theory committing her to something like the\nfollowing: \nThe basic idea is that truthbearers and facts are both complex\nstructured entities: truthbearers are composed of (other truthbearers\nand ultimately of) words, or concepts; facts are composed of (other\nfacts or states of affairs and ultimately of) things, properties, and\nrelations. The aim is to show how the correspondence relation is\ngenerated from underlying relations between the ultimate constituents\nof truthbearers, on the one hand, and the ultimate constituents of\ntheir corresponding facts, on the other. One part of the project will\nbe concerned with these correspondence-generating relations: it will\nlead into a theory that addresses the question how simple words, or\nconcepts, can be about things, properties, and relations;\ni.e., it will merge with semantics or psycho-semantics (depending on\nwhat the truthbearers are taken to be). The other part of the project,\nthe specifically ontological part, will have to provide identity\ncriteria for facts and explain how their simple constituents combine\ninto complex wholes.  Putting all this together should yield an\naccount of the conditions determining which truthbearers correspond to\nwhich facts. \n\nCorrelation and Structure reflect distinct aspects of\ncorrespondence. One might want to endorse the former without the\nlatter, though it is hard to see how one could endorse the latter\nwithout embracing at least part (a) of the former. \n\nThe isomorphism approach offers an answer to objection 3.C1.  Although\nthe truth that the cat is on the mat does not resemble the cat or the\nmat (the truth doesn’t meow or smell, etc.), it does resemble\nthe fact that the cat is on the mat. This is not a\nqualitative resemblance; it is a more abstract, structural\nresemblance. \n\nThe approach also puts objection 3.C2 in some perspective. The\ncorrespondence relation is supposed to reduce to underlying relations\nbetween words, or concepts, and reality. Consequently, a\ncorrespondence theory is little more than a spin-off from semantics\nand/or psycho-semantics, i.e. the theory of intentionality construed\nas incorporating a representational theory of the mind (cf. Fodor\n1989). This reminds us that, as a relation, correspondence is no\nmore—but also no less—mysterious than semantic relations\nin general. Such relations have some curious features, and they raise\na host of puzzles and difficult questions—most notoriously: Can\nthey be explained in terms of natural (causal) relations, or do they\nhave to be regarded as irreducibly non-natural aspects of reality?\nSome philosophers have claimed that semantic relations are too\nmysterious to be taken seriously, usually on the grounds that they are\nnot explainable in naturalistic terms. But one should bear in mind\nthat this is a very general and extremely radical attack on semantics\nas a whole, on the very idea that words and concepts can\nbe about things. The common practice to aim this attack\nspecifically at the correspondence theory seems misleading. As far as\nthe intelligibility of the correspondence relation is concerned, the\ncorrespondence theory will stand, or fall, with the general theory of\nreference and intentionality. \n\nIt should be noted, though, that these points concerning objections\n3.C1 and 3.C2 are not independent of one’s views about the\nnature of the primary truthbearers. If truthbearers are taken\nto be sentences of an ordinary language (or an idealized version\nthereof), or if they are taken to be mental representations (sentences\nof the language of thought), the above points hold without\nqualification: correspondence will be a semantic or psycho-semantic\nrelation. If, on the other hand, the primary truthbearers are taken to\nbe propositions, there is a complication: \n\nBut Russellians don’t usually renounce the correspondence theory\nentirely. Though they have no room for (1) from Section 3, when\napplied to propositions as truthbearers, correspondence will enter\ninto their account of truth for sentences, public or mental. The\naccount will take the form of Section 3’s (2), applied to\ncategories of truthbearers other than propositions, where Russellian\npropositions show up on the right-hand side in the guise of states of\naffairs that obtain or fail to obtain. Commitment to states of affairs\nin addition to propositions is sometimes regarded with scorn, as a\ngratuitous ontological duplication. But Russellians are not committed\nto states of affairs in addition to propositions, for\npropositions, on their view, must already be states of\naffairs. This conclusion is well nigh inevitable, once true\npropositions have been identified with facts. If a true proposition is\na fact, then a false proposition that might have been true would have\nbeen a fact, if it had been true. So, a (contingent) false proposition\nmust be the same kind of being as a fact, only not a fact—an\nunfact; but that just is a non-obtaining state of affairs under a\ndifferent name. Russellian propositions are states of affairs: the\nfalse ones are states of affairs that do not obtain, and the true ones\nare states of affairs that do obtain. \n\nThe Russellian view of propositions is popular nowadays. Somewhat\ncuriously, contemporary Russellians hardly ever refer to propositions\nas facts or states of affairs. This is because they are much concerned\nwith understanding belief, belief attributions, and the semantics of\nsentences. In such contexts, it is more natural to talk\nproposition-language than state-of-affairs-language. It feels odd\n(wrong) to say that someone believes a state of affairs, or that\nstates of affairs are true or false. For that matter, it also feels\nodd (wrong) to say that some propositions are facts, that facts are\ntrue, and that propositions obtain or fail to obtain. Nevertheless,\nall of this must be the literal truth, according to the\nRussellians. They have to claim that “proposition” and\n“state of affairs”, much like “evening star”\nand “morning star”, are different names for the same\nthings—they come with different associations and are at home in\nsomewhat different linguistic environments, which accounts for the\nfelt oddness when one name is transported to the other’s\nenvironment. \n\nReturning to the isomorphism approach in general, on a strict or\nnaïve implementation of this approach, correspondence will be a\none-one relation between truths and corresponding facts, which leaves\nthe approach vulnerable to objections against funny facts (3.F1): each\ntrue truthbearer, no matter how complex, will be assigned a matching\nfact. Moreover, since a strict implementation of isomorphism assigns\ncorresponding entities to all (relevant) constituents of truthbearers,\ncomplex facts will contain objects corresponding to the logical\nconstants (“not”, “or”, “if-then”,\netc.), and these “logical objects” will have to be\nregarded as constituents of the world. Many philosophers have found it\nhard to believe in the existence of all these funny facts and funny\nquasi-logical objects. \n\nThe isomorphism approach has never been advocated in a fully\nnaïve form, assigning corresponding objects to each and every\nwrinkle of our verbal or mental utterings. Instead, proponents try to\nisolate the “relevant” constituents of truthbearers\nthrough meaning analysis, aiming to uncover the logical form,\nor deep structure, behind ordinary language and thought. This deep\nstructure might then be expressed in an ideal-language\n(typically, the language of predicate logic), whose syntactic\nstructure is designed to mirror perfectly the ontological structure of\nreality. The resulting view—correspondence as isomorphism\nbetween properly analyzed truthbearers and facts—avoids\nassigning strange objects to such phrases as “the average\nhusband”, “the sake of”, and “the present king\nof France”; but the view remains committed to logically complex\nfacts and to logical objects corresponding to the logical\nconstants. \n\nAustin (1950) rejects the isomorphism approach on the grounds that it\nprojects the structure of our language onto the world. On his version\nof the correspondence theory (a more elaborated variant of (4) applied\nto statements), a statement as a whole is correlated to a state of\naffairs by arbitrary linguistic conventions without mirroring the\ninner structure of its correlate (cf. also Vision 2004). This approach\nappears vulnerable to the objection that it avoids funny facts at the\nprice of neglecting systematicity. Language does not provide separate\nlinguistic conventions for each statement: that would require too vast\na number of conventions. Rather, it seems that the truth-values of\nstatements are systematically determined, via a relatively small set\nof conventions, by the semantic values (relations to reality) of their\nsimpler constituents. Recognition of this systematicity is built right\ninto the isomorphism approach. \n\nCritics frequently echo Austin’s\n“projection”-complaint, 3.F2, that a traditional\ncorrespondence theory commits “the error of reading back into\nthe world the features of language” (Austin 1950, p. 155;\ncf. also, e.g., Rorty 1981). At bottom, this is a pessimistic stance:\nif there is a prima facie structural resemblance between a mode of\nspeech or thought and some ontological category, it is inferred,\npessimistically, that the ontological category is an illusion, a\nmatter of us projecting the structure of our language or thought into\nthe world. Advocates of traditional correspondence theories can be\nseen as taking the opposite stance: unless there are specific reasons\nto the contrary, they are prepared to assume, optimistically, that the\nstructure of our language and/or thought reflects genuine ontological\ncategories, that the structure of our language and/or thought is, at\nleast to a significant extent, the way it is because of the\nstructure of the world. \n\nWittgenstein (1921) and Russell (1918) propose modified fact-based\ncorrespondence accounts of truth as part of their program of\nlogical atomism. Such accounts proceed in two stages. At the\nfirst stage, the basic truth-definition, say (1) from Section 3,\nis restricted to a special subclass of truthbearers, the\nso-called elementary or atomic truthbearers, whose\ntruth is said to consist in their correspondence to (atomic) facts:\nif x is elementary, then x is true iff x\ncorresponds to some (atomic) fact. This restricted definition serves\nas the base-clause for truth-conditional recursion-clauses given at\nthe second stage, at which the truth-values of non-elementary, or\nmolecular, truthbearers are explained recursively in terms of\ntheir logical structure and the truth-values of their simpler\nconstituents. For example: a sentence of the form\n‘not-p’ is true iff ‘p’ is\nfalse; a sentence of the form ‘p and q’\nis true iff ‘p’ is true and\n‘q’ is true; a sentence of the form\n‘p or q’ is true iff\n‘p’ is true or ‘q’ is true,\netc. These recursive clauses (called “truth conditions”)\ncan be reapplied until the truth of a non-elementary, molecular\nsentence of arbitrary complexity is reduced to the truth or falsehood\nof its elementary, atomic constituents. \n\nLogical atomism exploits the familiar rules, enshrined in the\ntruth-tables, for evaluating complex formulas on the basis of their\nsimpler constituents. These rules can be understood in two different\nways: (a) as tracing the ontological relations\nbetween complex facts and constituent simpler facts, or (b)\nas tracing logico-semantic relations, exhibiting how the\ntruth-values of complex sentences can be explained in terms of their\nlogical relations to simpler constituent sentences together with the\ncorrespondence and non-correspondence of simple, elementary sentences\nto atomic facts. Logical atomism takes option (b). \n\nLogical atomism is designed to go with the ontological view that the\nworld is the totality of atomic facts (cf. Wittgenstein 1921, 2.04);\nthus accommodating objection 3.F2 by doing without funny facts: atomic\nfacts are all the facts there are—although real-life atomists\ntend to allow conjunctive facts, regarding them as mere aggregates of\natomic facts. An elementary truth is true because it corresponds to an\natomic fact: correspondence is still isomorphism, but it holds\nexclusively between elementary truths and atomic facts. There is no\nmatch between truths and facts at the level of non-elementary,\nmolecular truths; e.g., ‘p’, ‘p\nor q’, and ‘p or r’ might\nall be true merely because ‘p’ corresponds to a\nfact). The trick for avoiding logically complex facts lies\nin not assigning any entities to the logical\nconstants. Logical complexity, so the idea goes, belongs to the\nstructure of language and/or thought; it is not a feature of the\nworld. This is expressed by Wittgenstein in an often quoted passage\n(1921, 4.0312): “My fundamental idea is that the ‘logical\nconstants’ are not representatives; that there can be no\nrepresentatives of the logic of facts”; and also by\nRussell (1918, p. 209f.): “You must not look about the real\nworld for an object which you can call ‘or’, and say\n‘Now look at this. This is ‘or’’”. \n\nThough accounts of this sort are naturally classified as versions of\nthe correspondence theory, it should be noted that they are strictly\nspeaking in conflict with the basic forms presented in Section\n3. According to logical atomism, it is not the case that for\nevery truth there is a corresponding fact. It is, however, still the\ncase that the being true of every truth is explained in terms\nof correspondence to a fact (or non-correspondence to any fact)\ntogether with (in the case of molecular truths) logical notions\ndetailing the logical structure of complex truthbearers. Logical\natomism attempts to avoid commitment to logically complex, funny facts\nvia structural analysis of truthbearers. It should not be\nconfused with a superficially similar account maintaining that\nmolecular facts are ultimately constituted by atomic facts. The latter\naccount would admit complex facts, offering an ontological analysis of\ntheir structure, and would thus be compatible with the basic forms\npresented in Section 3, because it would be compatible with the claim\nthat for every truth there is a corresponding fact. (For more on\nclassical logical atomism, see Wisdom 1931-1933, Urmson 1953, and the\nentries on\nRussell's logical atomism\nand \nWittgenstein's logical atomism \nin this encyclopedia.) \n\nWhile Wittgenstein and Russell seem to have held that the constituents\nof atomic facts are to be determined on the basis of a priori\nconsiderations, Armstrong (1997, 2004) advocates an a\nposteriori form of logical atomism. On his view, atomic facts are\ncomposed of particulars and simple universals (properties and\nrelations). The latter are objective features of the world that ground\nthe objective resemblances between particulars and explain their\ncausal powers. Accordingly, what particulars and universals there are\nwill have to be determined on the basis of total science. \n\nProblems: Logical atomism is not easy to sustain and\nhas rarely been held in a pure form. Among its difficulties are the\nfollowing: (a) What, exactly, are the elementary\ntruthbearers? How are they determined? (b) There are\nmolecular truthbearers, such as subjunctives and counterfactuals, that\ntend to provoke the funny-fact objection but cannot be handled by\nsimple truth-conditional clauses, because their truth-values do not\nseem to be determined by the truth-values of their elementary\nconstituents. (c) Are there universal facts corresponding to\ntrue universal generalizations? Wittgenstein (1921) disapproves of\nuniversal facts; apparently, he wants to re-analyze universal\ngeneralizations as infinite conjunctions of their instances. Russell\n(1918) and Armstrong (1997, 2004) reject this analysis; they admit\nuniversal facts. (d) Negative truths are the most notorious\nproblem case, because they clash with an appealing principle, the\n“truthmaker principle” (cf. Section 8.5), which says that\nfor every truth there must be something in the world that makes it\ntrue, i.e., every true truthbearer must have a truthmaker. Suppose\n‘p’ is elementary. On the account given above,\n‘not-p’ is true iff ‘p’ is\nfalse iff ‘p’ does not correspond to any fact;\nhence, ‘not-p’, if true, is not made true by any\nfact: it does not seem to have a truthmaker. Russell finds himself\ndriven to admit negative facts, regarded by many as paradigmatically\ndisreputable portions of reality. Wittgenstein sometimes talks of\natomic facts that do not exist and calls their very nonexistence a\nnegative fact (cf. 1921, 2.06)—but this is hardly an atomic fact\nitself. Armstrong (1997, chap. 8.7; 2004, chaps. 5-6) holds that\nnegative truths are made true by a second-order “totality\nfact” which says of all the (positive) first-order facts that\nthey are all the first-order facts. \n\nAtomism and the Russellian view of propositions (see\nSection 6). By the time Russell advocated logical atomism (around\n1918), he had given up on what is now referred to as the Russellian\nconception of propositions (which he and G. E. Moore held around\n1903). But Russellian propositons are popular nowadays. Note that\nlogical atomism is not for the friends of Russellian\npropositions. The argument is straightforward. We have logically\ncomplex beliefs some of which are true. According to the friends of\nRussellian propositions, the contents of our beliefs are Russellian\npropositions, and the contents of our true beliefs are true Russellian\npropositions. Since true Russellian propositions are facts, there must\nbe at least as many complex facts as there are true beliefs with\ncomplex contents (and at least as many complex states of affairs as\nthere are true or false beliefs with complex contents). Atomism may\nwork for sentences, public or mental, and for Fregean propositions;\nbut not for Russellian propositions. \n\nLogical atomism is designed to address objections to funny facts\n(3.F1). It is not designed to address objections to facts in general\n(3.F2). Here logical atomists will respond by defending (atomic)\nfacts.  According to one defense, facts are needed because mere\nobjects are not sufficiently articulated to serve as\ntruthmakers. If a were the sole truthmaker of\n‘a is F’, then the latter should imply\n‘a is G’, for any\n‘G’. So the truthmaker for ‘a\nis F’ needs at least to involve a\nand Fness. But since Fness is a universal, it could\nbe instantiated in another object, b, hence the mere\nexistence of a and Fness is not sufficient for\nmaking true the claim ‘a\nis F’: a and Fness need to be tied\ntogether in the fact of a’s being F. Armstrong (1997)\nand Olson (1987) also maintain that facts are needed to make sense of\nthe tie that binds particular objects to universals. \n\nIn this context it is usually emphasized that facts do not\nsupervene on, hence, are not reducible to, their constituents.\nFacts are entities over and above the particulars and\nuniversals of which they are composed: a’s loving b\nand b’s loving a are not the same fact even though they\nhave the very same constituents. \n\nAnother defense of facts, surprisingly rare, would point out that many\nfacts are observable: one can see that the cat is on the mat;\nand this is different from seeing the cat, or the mat, or both. The\nobjection that many facts are not observable would invite the\nrejoinder that many objects are not observable either. (See Austin\n1961, Vendler 1967, chap. 5, and Vision 2004, chap. 3, for more\ndiscussion of anti-fact arguments; see also the\nentry facts in this encyclopedia.) \n\nSome atomists propose an atomistic version of definition (1), but\nwithout facts, because they regard facts as slices of reality too\nsuspiciously sentence-like to be taken with full ontological\nseriousness. Instead, they propose events and/or objects-plus-tropes\n(a.k.a. modes, particularized qualities, moments) as the corresponding\nportions of reality. It is claimed that these items are more\n“thingy” than facts but still sufficiently\narticulated—and sufficiently abundant—to serve as adequate\ntruthmakers (cf. Mulligan, Simons, and Smith 1984). \n\nLogical atomism aims at getting by without logically complex\ntruthmakers by restricting definitions like (1) or (2) from Section 3\nto elementary truthbearers and accounting for the truth-values of\nmolecular truthbearers recursively in terms of their logical structure\nand atomic truthmakers (atomic facts, events,\nobjects-plus-tropes). More radical modifications of the correspondence\ntheory push the recursive strategy even further, entirely discarding\ndefinitions like (1) or (2), and hence the need for atomic\ntruthmakers, by going, as it were,\n“subatomic”. \n\nSuch accounts analyze truthbearers, e.g., sentences, into their\nsubsentential constituents and dissolve the relation of correspondence\ninto appropriate semantic subrelations: names refer to, or\ndenote, objects; predicates (open sentences) apply to, or are\nsatisfied by objects. Satisfaction of complex predicates can\nbe handled recursively in terms of logical structure and satisfaction\nof simpler constituent predicates: an object o satisfies\n‘x is not F’ iff o does not\nsatisfy ‘x is F’; o satisfies\n‘x is F or x is G’\niff o satisfies ‘x is F’\nor o satisfies ‘x is G’; and so\non. These recursions are anchored in a base-clause addressing the\nsatisfaction of primitive predicates: an object o\nsatisfies ‘x is F’ iff o\ninstantiates the property expressed by ‘F’. Some\nwould prefer a more nominalistic base-clause for satisfaction, hoping\nto get by without seriously invoking properties. Truth for singular\nsentences, consisting of a name and an arbitrarily complex predicate,\nis defined thus: A singular sentence is true iff the object denoted by\nthe name satisfies the predicate. Logical machinery provided by Tarski\n(1935) can be used to turn this simplified sketch into a more general\ndefinition of truth—a definition that handles sentences\ncontaining relational predicates and quantifiers and covers molecular\nsentences as well. Whether Tarski’s own definition of truth can\nbe regarded as a correspondence definition, even in this modified\nsense, is under debate (cf. Popper 1972; Field 1972, 1986; Kirkham\n1992, chaps. 5-6; Soames 1999; Künne 2003, chap. 4; Patterson\n2008.) \n\nSubatomism constitutes a return to (broadly) object-based\ncorrespondence. Since it promises to avoid facts and all similarly\narticulated, sentence-like slices of reality, correspondence theorists\nwho take seriously objection 3.F2 favor this approach: not even\nelementary truthbearers are assigned any matching truthmakers. The\ncorrespondence relation itself has given way to two semantic relations\nbetween constituents of truthbearers and objects: reference (or\ndenotation) and satisfaction—relations central to any semantic\ntheory. Some advocates envision causal accounts of reference and\nsatisfaction (cf.  Field 1972; Devitt 1982, 1984; Schmitt 1995;\nKirkham 1992, chaps. 5-6).  It turns out that relational predicates\nrequire talk of satisfaction by ordered sequences of\nobjects. Davidson (1969, 1977) maintains that satisfaction by\nsequences is all that remains of the traditional idea of\ncorrespondence to facts; he regards reference and satisfaction as\n“theoretical constructs” not in need of causal, or any,\nexplanation. \n\nProblems: (a) The subatomistic approach\naccounts for the truth-values of molecular truthbearers in the same\nway as the atomistic approach; consequently, molecular truthbearers\nthat are not truth-functional still pose the same problems as in\natomism. (b) Belief attributions and modal claims pose\nspecial problems; e.g., it seems that “believes” is a\nrelational predicate, so that “John believes that snow is\nwhite” is true iff “believes” is satisfied by John\nand the object denoted by “that snow is white”; but the\nlatter appears to be a proposition or state of affairs, which\nthreatens to let in through the back-door the very sentence-like\nslices of reality the subatomic approach was supposed to avoid, thus\nundermining the motivation for going subatomic. (c) The\nphenomenon of referential indeterminacy threatens to undermine the\nidea that the truth-values of elementary truthbearers are always\ndetermined by the denotation and/or satisfaction of their\nconstituents; e.g., pre-relativistic uses of the term\n“mass” are plausibly taken to lack determinate reference\n(referring determinately neither to relativistic mass nor to rest\nmass); yet a claim like “The mass of the earth is greater than\nthe mass of the moon” seems to be determinately true even when\nmade by Newton (cf. Field 1973). \n\nProblems for both versions of modified correspondence\ntheories: (a) It is not known whether an entirely\ngeneral recursive definition of truth, one that covers all\ntruthbearers, can be made available. This depends on unresolved issues\nconcerning the extent to which truthbearers are amenable to the kind\nof structural analyses that are presupposed by the recursive\nclauses. The more an account of truth wants to exploit the internal\nstructure of truthbearers, the more it will be hostage to the\n(limited) availability of appropriate structural analyses of the\nrelevant truthbearers. (b) Any account of truth employing a\nrecursive framework may be virtually committed to taking sentences\n(maybe sentences of the language of thought) as primary\ntruthbearers. After all, the recursive clauses rely heavily on what\nappears to be the logico-syntactic structure of truthbearers, and it\nis unclear whether anything but sentences can plausibly be said to\npossess that kind of structure. But the thesis that sentences of any\nsort are to be regarded as the primary truthbearers is\ncontentious. Whether propositions can meaningfully be said to have an\nanalogous (albeit non-linguistic) structure is under debate\n(cf. Russell 1913, King 2007). (c) If clauses like\n“‘p or q’ is true iff\n‘p’ is true or ‘q’ is\ntrue” are to be used in a recursive account of our\nnotion of truth, as opposed to some other notion, it has to\nbe presupposed that ‘or’ expresses disjunction:\none cannot define “or” and “true” at the same\ntime. To avoid circularity, a modified correspondence theory (be it\natomic or subatomic) must hold that the logical connectives can be\nunderstood without reference to correspondence truth. \n\nDefinitions like (1) and (2) from Section 3 assume, naturally, that\ntruthbearers are true because they, the truthbearers themselves,\ncorrespond to facts. There are however views that reject this natural\nassumption. They propose to account for the truth of truthbearers of\ncertain kinds, propositions, not by way of their\ncorrespondence to facts, but by way of the correspondence to facts of\nother items, the ones that have propositions as their\ncontents. Consider the state of believing that p (or the\nactivity of judging that p). The state (the\nactivity) is not, strictly speaking, true or false; rather, what is\ntrue or false is its content, the proposition\nthat p. Nevertheless, on the present view, it is the state of\nbelieving that p that corresponds or fails to correspond to a\nfact. So truth/falsehood for propositions can be defined in the\nfollowing manner: x is a true/false proposition iff there is\na belief state B such that x is the content\nof B and B corresponds/fails to correspond to a\nfact. \n\nSuch a modification of fact-based correspondence can be found in Moore\n(1927, p. 83) and Armstrong (1973, 4.iv & 9). It can be adapted to\natomistic (Armstrong) and subatomistic views, and to views on which\nsentences (of the language of thought) are the primary bearers of\ntruth and falsehood. However, by taking the content-carrying states as\nthe primary corresponders, it entails that there are no\ntruths/falsehoods that are not believed by someone. Most advocates of\npropositions as primary bearers of truth and falsehood will regard\nthis as a serious weakness, holding that there are very many true and\nfalse propositions that are not believed, or even entertained, by\nanyone. Armstrong (1973) combines the view with an instrumentalist\nattitude towards propositions, on which propositions are mere\nabstractions from mental states and should not be taken seriously,\nontologically speaking. \n\nAgainst the traditional competitors—coherentist,\npragmatist, and verificationist and other epistemic theories of\ntruth—correspondence theorists raise two main sorts of\nobjections. First, such accounts tend to lead into\nrelativism. Take, e.g., a coherentist account of truth. Since it is\npossible that ‘p’ coheres with the belief system\nof S while ‘not-p’ coheres with the\nbelief system of S*, the coherentist account seems to imply,\nabsurdly, that contradictories, ‘p’ and\n‘not-p’, could both be true. To avoid embracing\ncontradictions, coherentists often commit themselves (if only\ncovertly) to the objectionable relativistic view that\n‘p’ is true-for-S and\n‘not-p’ is true-for-S*. Second,\nthe accounts tend to lead into some form of idealism or anti-realism,\ne.g., it is possible for the belief that p to cohere with\nsomeone’s belief system, even though it is not a fact that\np; also, it is possible for it to be a fact that p,\neven if no one believes that p at all or if the belief does\nnot cohere with anyone’s belief system. Cases of this sort are\nfrequently cited as counterexamples to coherentist accounts of\ntruth. Dedicated coherentists tend to reject such counterexamples,\ninsisting that they are not possible after all. Since it is hard to\nsee why they would not be possible, unless its being a fact that\np were determined by the belief’s coherence with other\nbeliefs, this reaction commits them to the anti-realist view that the\nfacts are (largely) determined by what we believe. \n\nThis offers a bare outline of the overall shape the debates tend to\ntake. For more on the correspondence theory vs. its traditional\ncompetitors see, e.g., Vision 1988; Kirkham 1992, chaps. 3, 7-8;\nSchmitt 1995; Künne 2003, chap. 7; and essays in Lynch\n2001. Walker 1989 is a book-lenght discussion of coherence theories of\ntruth. See also the entries on\n pragmatism,\n relativism,\n the coherence theory of truth, \nin this encyclopedia. \n\nThe correspondence theory is sometimes accused of overreaching itself:\nit does apply, so the objection goes, to truths from some domains of\ndiscourse, e.g., scientific discourse and/or discourse about everyday\nmidsized physical things, but not to truths from various other domains\nof discourse, e.g., ethical and/or aesthetic discourse (see the first\nobjection in Section 5 above). Alethic pluralism grows out of\nthis objection, maintaining that truth is constituted by\ndifferent properties for true propositions from different domains of\ndiscourse: by correspondence to fact for true propositions from the\ndomain of scientific or everyday discourse about physical things; by\nsome epistemic property, such as coherence or superassertibility, for\ntrue propositions from the domain of ethical and aesthetic discourse,\nand maybe by still other properties for other domains of\ndiscourse. This suggests a position on which the term\n“true” is multiply ambiguous, expressing different\nproperties when applied to propositions from different\ndomains. However, contemporary pluralists reject this problematic\nidea, maintaining instead that truth is “multiply\nrealizable”. That is, the term “true” is univocal,\nit expresses one concept or property, truth (being true), but one that\ncan be realized by or manifested in different\nproperties (correspondence to fact, coherence or superassertibility,\nand maybe others) for true propositions from different domains of\ndiscourse. Truth itself is not to be identified with any of its\nrealizing properties. Instead, it is characterized, quasi\naxiomatically, by a set of alleged “platitudes”,\nincluding, according to Crispin Wright’s (1999) version,\n“transparency” (to assert is to present as true),\n“contrast” (a proposition may be true without being\njustified, and v.v.), “timelesness” (if a proposition is\never true, then it always is), “absoluteness” (there is no\nsuch thing as a proposition being more or less true), and others. Though it contains the correspondence theory as one ingredient,\nalethic pluralism is nevertheless a genuine competitor, for it rejects\nthe thesis that truth is correspondence to reality. Moreover,\nit equally contains competitors of the correspondence theory as\nfurther ingredients. \n\nAlethic pluralism in its contemporary form is a relatively young\nposition. It was inaugurated by Crispin Wright (1992; see also 1999)\nand was later developed into a somewhat different form by Lynch\n(2009). Critical discussion is still at a relatively nascent stage\n(but see Vision 2004, chap. 4, for extended discussion of Wright). It\nwill likely focus on two main problem areas. \n\nFirst, it seems difficult to sort propositions into distinct\nkinds according to the subject matter they are about. Take, e.g., the\nproposition that killing is morally wrong, or the proposition that\nimmoral acts happen in space-time. What are they about? Intuitively,\ntheir subject matter is mixed, belonging to the physical domain, the\nbiological domain, and the domain of ethical discourse. It is hard to\nsee how pluralism can account for the truth of such mixed\npropositions, belonging to more than one domain of discourse: What\nwill be the realizing property? \n\nSecond, pluralists are expected to explain how the platitudes\ncan be “converted” into an account of truth itself. Lynch\n(2009) proposes to construe truth as a functional property,\ndefined in terms of a complex functional role which is given\nby the conjunction of the platitudes (somewhat analogous to the way in\nwhich functionalists in the philosophy of mind construe mental states\nas functional states, specified in terms of their functional\nroles—though in their case the relevant functional roles are\ncausal roles, which is not a feasible option when it comes to the\ntruth-role). Here the main issue will be to determine (a)\nwhether such an account really works, when the technical details are\nlaid out, and (b) whether it is plausible to claim that\nproperties as different as correspondence to a fact, on the one hand,\nand coherence or superassertibilty, on the other, can be said to play\none and the same role—a claim that seems required by the thesis\nthat these different properties all realize the same property, being\ntrue. \n\nFor more on pluralism, see e.g. the essays in Monnoyer (2007) and in\nPedersen & Wright (2013); and the entry on\n pluralist theories of truth \n in this encyclopedia. \n\nAccording to the identity theory of truth, true propositions\ndo not correspond to facts, they are facts: the true\nproposition that snow is white = the fact that snow is white. This\nnon-traditional competitor of the correspondence theory threatens to\ncollapse the correspondence relation into identity. (See Moore\n1901-02; and Dodd 2000 for a book-length defense of this theory and\ndiscussion contrasting it with the correspondence theory; and see the\nentry\n the identity theory of truth:  \n in this encyclopedia.) \n\nIn response, a correspondence theorist will point out: (a)\nThe identity theory is defensible only for propositions as\ntruthbearers, and only for propositions construed in a certain way,\nnamely as having objects and properties as constituents rather than\nideas or concepts of objects and properties; that is, for Russellian\npropositions. Hence, there will be ample room (and need) for\ncorrespondence accounts of truth for other types of truthbearers,\nincluding propositions, if they are construed as constituted, partly\nor wholly, of concepts of objects and\nproperties. (b) The identity theory is committed to the\nunacceptable consequence that facts are true. (c) The\nidentity theory rests on the assumption that that-clauses always\ndenote propositions, so that the that-clause in “the fact that\nsnow is white” denotes the proposition that snow is white. The\nassumption can be questioned. That-clauses can be understood as\nambiguous names, sometimes denoting propositions and sometimes\ndenoting facts. The descriptive phrases “the\nproposition…” and “the fact…” can be\nregarded as serving to disambiguate the succeeding ambiguous\nthat-clauses—much like the descriptive phrases in “the\nphilosopher Socrates” and “the soccer-player\nSocrates” serve to disambiguate the ambiguous name\n“Socrates” (cf. David 2002). \n\nAt present the most noticeable competitors to correspondence theories\nare deflationary accounts of truth (or\n‘true’). Deflationists maintain that correspondence\ntheories need to be deflated; that their central notions,\ncorrespondence and fact (and their relatives), play no legitimate role\nin an adequate account of truth and can be excised without loss. A\ncorrespondence-type formulation like \n\nis to be deflated to \n\nwhich, according to deflationists, says all there is to be said about\nthe truth of “Snow is white”, without superfluous\nembellishments (cf. Quine 1987, p. 213). \n\nCorrespondence theorists protest that (6) cannot lead to anything\ndeserving to be regarded as an account of truth. It is concerned with\nonly one particular sentence (“Snow is white”), and it\nresists generalization. (6) is a substitution instance of the\nschema \n\nwhich does not actually say anything itself (it is not\ntruth-evaluable) and cannot be turned into a genuine generalization\nabout truth, because of its essential reliance on the schematic letter\n“p”, a mere placeholder. The attempt to turn (7) into a\ngeneralization produces nonsense along the lines of “For\nevery x, “x” is true\niff x”, or requires invocation of truth: “Every\nsubstitution instance of the schema ““p” is true iff\np” is true”. Moreover, no genuine generalizations\nabout truth can be accounted for on the basis of (7). Correspondence\ndefinitions, on the other hand, do yield genuine generalizations about\ntruth. Note that definitions like (1) and (2) in Section 3 employ\nordinary objectual variables (not mere schematic placeholders); the\ndefinitions are easily turned into genuine generalizations by\nprefixing the quantifier phrase “For every x”,\nwhich is customarily omitted in formulations intended as\ndefinitions. \n\nIt should be noted that the deflationist’s starting point, (5),\nwhich lends itself to deflating excisions, actually misrepresents the\ncorrespondence theory. According to (5), corresponding to the fact\nthat snow is white is sufficient and necessary for\n“Snow is white” to be true. Yet, according to (1) and (2),\nit is sufficient but not necessary: “Snow is white” will\nbe true as long as it corresponds to some fact or other. The genuine\narticle, (1) or (2), is not as easily deflated as the impostor\n(5). \n\nThe debate turns crucially on the question whether anything deserving\nto be called an “account” or “theory” of truth\nought to take the form of a genuine generalization (and ought to be\nable to account for genuine generalizations involving\ntruth). Correspondence theorists tend to regard this as a (minimal)\nrequirement. Deflationists argue that truth is a shallow (sometimes\n“logical”) notion—a notion that has no serious\nexplanatory role to play: as such it does not require a full-fledged\naccount, a real theory, that would have to take the form of a genuine\ngeneralization. \n\nThere is now a substantial body of literature on truth-deflationism in\ngeneral and its relation to the correspondence theory in particular;\nthe following is a small selection: Quine 1970, 1987; Devitt 1984;\nField 1986; Horwich 1990 & 19982; Kirkham 1992; Gupta\n1993; David 1994, 2008; Schmitt 1995; Künne 2003, chap. 4; Rami\n2009. Relevant essays are contained in Blackburn and Simmons 1999;\nSchantz 2002; Armour-Garb and Beall 2005; and Wright and Pedersen\n2010. See also the entry\n the deflationary theory of truth \nin this encyclopedia. \n\nThis approach centers on the truthmaker\nor truthmaking principle: Every truth has a\ntruthmaker; or alternatively: For every truth there is something that\nmakes it true. The principle is usually understood as an expression of\na realist attitude, emphasizing the crucial contribution the world\nmakes to the truth of a proposition. Advocates tend to treat\ntruthmaker theory primarily as a guide to ontology, asking: To\nentities of what ontological categories are we committed as\ntruthmakers of the propositions we accept as true? Most advocates\nmaintain that propositions of different logical types can be made true\nby items from different ontological categories: e.g., propositions of\nsome types are made true by facts, others just by individual things,\nothers by events, others by tropes (cf., e.g. Armstrong 1997). This is\nclaimed as a significant improvement over traditional correspondence\ntheories which are understood—correctly in most but by no means\nall cases—to be committed to all truthmakers belonging to a\nsingle ontological category (albeit disagreeing about which category\nthat is). All advocates of truthmaker theory maintain that the\ntruthmaking relation is not one-one but many-many: some truths are\nmade true by more than one truthmaker; some truthmakers make true more\nthan one truth. This is also claimed as a significant improvement over\ntraditional correspondence theories which are often portrayed as\ncommitted to correspondence being a one-one relation. This portrayal\nis only partly justified. While it is fairly easy to find real-life\ncorrespondence theorists committing themselves to the view that each\ntruth corresponds to exactly one fact (at least by implication,\ntalking about the corresponding fact), it is difficult to\nfind real-life correspondence theorists committing themselves to the\nview that only one truth can correspond to a given fact (but see Moore\n1910-11, p. 256). \n\nA truthmaker theory may be presented as a competitor to the\ncorrespondence theory or as a version of the correspondence\ntheory. This depends considerably on how narrowly or broadly one\nconstrues “correspondence theory”, i.e. on terminological\nissues. Some advocates would agree with Dummett (1959, p. 14) who said\nthat, although “we have nowadays abandoned the correspondence\ntheory of truth”, it nevertheless “expresses one important\nfeature of the concept of truth…: that a statement is true only\nif there is something in the world in virtue of which it is\ntrue”. Other advocates would follow Armstrong who tends to\npresent his truthmaker theory as a liberal form of correspondence\ntheory; indeed, he seems committed to the view that the truth of a\n(contingent) elementary proposition consists in its\ncorrespondence with some (atomic) fact (cf. Armstrong 1997; 2004,\npp. 22-3, 48-50). \n\nIt is not easy to find a substantive difference between truthmaker\ntheory and various brands of the sort of modified correspondence\ntheory treated above under the heading “Logical Atomism”\n(see Section 7.1). Logical atomists, such as Russell (1918) and\nWittgenstein (1921), will hold that the truth or falsehood of every\ntruth-value bearer can be explained in terms of (can be derived from)\nlogical relations between truth-value bearers, by way of the recursive\nclauses, together with the base clauses, i.e., the correspondence and\nnon-correspondence of elementary truth-value bearers with facts. This\nrecursive strategy could be pursued with the aim to reject the\ntruthmaker principle: not all truths have truthmakers, only\nelementary truths have truthmakers (here understood as corresponding\natomic facts). But it could also be pursued—and this seems to\nhave been Russell’s intention at the time—with the aim\nto secure the truthmaker principle, even though the simple\ncorrespondence definition has been abandoned: not every truth\ncorresponds to a fact, only elementary truths do, but every\ntruth has a truthmaker; where the recursive clauses are\nsupposed to show how truthmaking without correspondence, but grounded\nin correspondence, comes about. \n\nThere is one straightforward difference between truthmaker theory and\nmost correspondence theories. The latter are designed to answer the\nquestion “What is truth?”. Simple (unmodified)\ncorrespondence theories center on a biconditional, such as\n“x is true iff x corresponds to a fact”,\nintended to convey a definition of truth (at least a\n“real definition” which does not commit them to the claim\nthat the term “true” is synonymous with “corresponds\nto a fact”—especially nowadays most correspondence\ntheorists would consider such a claim to be implausibly and\nunnecessarily bold). Modified correspondence theories also aim at\nproviding a definition of truth, though in their case the definition\nwill be considerably more complex, owing to the recursive character of\nthe account. Truthmaker theory, on the other hand, centers on\nthe truthmaker principle: For every truth there is something\nthat makes it true. Though this principle will deliver the\nbiconditional “x is true iff something makes x\ntrue” (since “something makes x true”\ntrivially implies “x is true”), this does not\nyield a promising candidate for a definition of truth: defining truth\nin terms of truthmaking would appear to be circular. Unlike most\ncorrespondence theories, truthmaker theory is not equipped, and\nusually not designed, to answer the question “What is\ntruth?”—at least not if one expects the answer to take the\nform of a feasible candidate for a definition of truth. \n\nThere is a growing body of literature on truthmaker theory; see for\nexample: Russell 1918; Mullligan, Simons, and Smith 1984; Fox 1987;\nArmstrong 1997, 2004; Merricks 2007; and the essays in Beebe and Dodd\n2005; Monnoyer 2007; and in Lowe and Rami 2009. See also the entry\non truthmakers in this encyclopedia. \n\nTwo final objections to the correspondence theory deserve separate\nmention. \n\nInspired by an allegedly similar argument of Frege’s, Davidson\n(1969) argues that the correspondence theory is bankrupt because it\ncannot avoid the consequence that all true sentences correspond to the\nsame fact: the Big Fact. The argument is based on two crucial\nassumptions: (i) Logically equivalent sentences can be\nsubstituted salva veritate in the context ‘the fact\nthat...’; and (ii) If two singular terms denoting the same thing\ncan be substituted for each other in a given sentence salva\nveritate, they can still be so substituted if that sentence is\nembedded within the context ‘the fact that...’. In the\nversion below, the relevant singular terms will be the following:\n‘(the x such that x = Diogenes\n& p)’ and ‘(the x such\nthat x = Diogenes & q)’. Now, assume that\na given sentence, s, corresponds to the fact that p;\nand assume that ‘p’ and ‘q’\nare sentences with the same truth-value. We have: \n which, by (i), implies  which, by (ii), implies \n which, by (i), implies \n\nSince the only restriction on ‘q’ was that it\nhave the same truth-value as ‘p’, it would follow\nthat any sentence s that corresponds to any fact corresponds\nto every fact; so that all true sentences correspond to the same\nfacts, thereby proving the emptiness of the correspondence\ntheory—the conclusion of the argument is taken as tantamount to\nthe conclusion that every true sentence corresponds to the totality of\nall the facts, i.e, the Big Fact, i.e., the world as a whole. \n\nThis argument belongs to a type now called “slingshot\narguments” (because a giant opponent is brought down by a single\nsmall weapon, allegedly). The first versions of this type of argument\nwere given by Church (1943) and Gödel (1944); it was later\nadapted by Quine (1953, 1960) in his crusade against quantified modal\nlogic. Davidson is offering yet another adaption, this time involving\nthe expression “corresponds to the fact that”. The\nargument has been criticized repeatedly. Critics point to the two\nquestionable assumptions on which it relies, (i) and (ii). It is far\nfrom obvious why a correspondence theorist should be tempted by either\none of them. Opposition to assumption (i) rests on the view that\nexpressibility by logically equivalent sentences may be a necessary,\nbut is not a sufficient condition for fact identity. Opposition to\nassumption (ii) rests on the observation that the (alleged) singular\nterms used in the argument are definite descriptions: their\nstatus as genuine singular terms is in doubt, and it is well-known\nthat they behave rather differently than proper names for which\nassumption (ii) is probably valid (cf. Follesdal 1966/2004; Olson\n1987; Künne 2003; and especially the extended discussion and\ncriticism in Neale 2001.) \n\nThe objection that may well have been the most effective in causing\ndiscontent with the correspondence theory is based on an\nepistemological concern. In a nutshell, the objection is that a\ncorrespondence theory of truth must inevitably lead into skepticism\nabout the external world, because the required correspondence between\nour thoughts and reality is not ascertainable. Ever since\nBerkeley’s attack on the representational theory of the mind,\nobjections of this sort have enjoyed considerable popularity. It is\ntypically pointed out that we cannot step outside our own minds to\ncompare our thoughts with mind-independent reality. Yet—so the\nobjection continues—on the correspondence theory of truth, this\nis precisely what we would have to do to gain knowledge. We would have\nto access reality as it is in itself, independently of our cognition,\nand determine whether our thoughts correspond to it. Since this is\nimpossible, since all our access to the world is mediated by our\ncognition, the correspondence theory makes knowledge impossible\n(cf. Kant 1800, intro vii). Assuming that the resulting skepticism is\nunacceptable, the correspondence theory has to be rejected, and some\nother account of truth, an epistemic (anti-realist) account of some\nsort, has to be put in its place (cf., e.g., Blanshard 1941.) \n\nThis type of objection brings up a host of issues in epistemology, the\nphilosophy of mind, and general metaphysics. All that can be done here\nis to hint at a few pertinent points (cf. Searle 1995, chap. 7; David\n2004, 6.7). The objection makes use of the following line of\nreasoning: “If truth is correspondence, then, since knowledge\nrequires truth, we have to know that our beliefs correspond to\nreality, if we are to know anything about reality”. There are\ntwo assumptions implicit in this line of reasoning, both of them\ndebatable. \n\n(i) It is assumed that S knows x, only if S\nknows that\nx is true—a requirement not underwritten by standard\ndefinitions of knowledge, which tell us that S knows\nx, only if x is true and S is justified in\nbelieving x. The assumption may rest on confusing requirements\nfor knowing x with requirements for knowing that one knows\nx. \n\n(ii) It is assumed that, if truth = F, then S knows\nthat x is true, only if S knows that x has\nF. This is highly implausible. By the same standard it\nwould follow that no one who does not know that water is\nH2O can know that the Nile contains water—which would\nmean, of course, that until fairly recently nobody knew that the Nile\ncontained water (and that, until fairly recently, nobody\nknew that there were stars in the sky, whales in the sea, or that the\nsun gives light). Moreover, even if one does know that water is\nH2O, one’s strategy for finding out whether the liquid in\none’s glass is water does not have to involve chemical analysis: one\ncould simply taste it, or ask a reliable informant. Similarly, as far\nas knowing that x is true is concerned, the\ncorrespondence theory does not entail that we have to know that a\nbelief corresponds to a fact in order to know that it is true, or that\nour method of finding out whether a belief is true has to involve a\nstrategy of actually comparing a belief with a fact—although the\ntheory does of course entail that one obtains knowledge only if\none obtains a belief that corresponds to a fact. \n\nMore generally, one might question whether the objection still has\nmuch bite once the metaphors of “accessing” and\n“comparing” are spelled out with more attention to the\npsychological details of belief formation and to epistemological\nissues concerning the conditions under which beliefs are justified or\nwarranted. For example, it is quite unclear how the metaphor of\n“comparing” applies to knowledge gained through perceptual\nbelief-formation. A perceptual belief that p may be true, and by\nhaving acquired that belief, one may have come to know that p, without\nhaving “compared” (the content of) one’s belief with\nanything. \n\nOne might also wonder whether its competitors actually enjoy any\nsignificant advantage over the correspondence theory, once they are\nheld to the standards set up by this sort of objection. For example,\nwhy should it be easier to find out whether one particular belief\ncoheres with all of one’s other beliefs than it is to\nfind out whether a belief corresponds with a fact? \n\nIn one form or other, the “No independent access to\nreality”-objection against correspondence theoretic approaches\nhas been one of the, if not the, main source and motivation for\nidealist and anti-realist stances in philosophy (cf. Stove\n1991). However, the connection between correspondence theories of\ntruth and the metaphysical realism vs. anti-realism (or idealism)\ndebate is less immediate than is often assumed. On the one hand,\ndeflationists and identity theorists can be, and typically are,\nmetaphysical realists while rejecting the correspondence theory. On\nthe other hand, advocates of a correspondence theory can, in\nprinciple, be metaphysical idealists (e.g. McTaggart 1921) or\nanti-realists, for one might advocate a correspondence theory while\nmaintaining, at the same time, (a) that all facts are\nconstituted by mind or (b) that what facts there are depends\nsomehow on what we believe or are capable of believing, or\n(c) that the correspondence relation between true\npropositions and facts depends somehow on what we believe or are\ncapable of believing (claiming that the correspondence relation\nbetween true beliefs or true sentences and facts depends on what we\nbelieve can hardly count as a commitment to anti-realism). Keeping\nthis point in mind, one can nevertheless acknowledge that advocacy of\na correspondence theory of truth comes much more naturally when\ncombined with a metaphysically realist stance and usually signals\ncommitment to such a stance.","contact.mail":"marian.david@uni-graz.at","contact.domain":"uni-graz.at"}]
