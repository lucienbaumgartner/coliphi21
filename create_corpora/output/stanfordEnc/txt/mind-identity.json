Smart","entry":"mind-identity","body.text":"\n\n\n\nThe identity theory of mind holds that states and processes of the mind\nare identical to states and processes of the brain. Strictly speaking,\nit need not hold that the mind is identical to the brain. Idiomatically\nwe do use ‘She has a good mind’ and ‘She has a good\nbrain’ interchangeably but we would hardly say ‘Her mind\nweighs fifty ounces’. Here I take identifying mind and brain as\nbeing a matter of identifying processes and perhaps states of the mind\nand brain. Consider an experience of pain, or of seeing something, or\nof having a mental image. The identity theory of mind is to the effect\nthat these experiences just are brain processes, not merely\ncorrelated with brain processes. \n\n\n\nSome philosophers hold that though experiences are brain processes\nthey nevertheless have fundamentally non-physical, psychical,\nproperties, sometimes called ‘qualia’. Here I shall take\nthe identity theory as denying the existence of such irreducible\nnon-physical properties. Some identity theorists give a behaviouristic\nanalysis of mental states, such as beliefs and desires, but\nothers, sometimes called ‘central state materialists’, say\nthat mental states are actual brain states. Identity theorists often\ndescribe themselves as ‘materialists’ but\n‘physicalists’ may be a better word. That is, one might be\na materialist about mind but nevertheless hold that there are entities\nreferred to in physics that are not happily described as\n‘material’.\n\n\n\nIn taking the identity theory (in its various forms) as a species of\nphysicalism, I should say that this is an ontological, not a\ntranslational physicalism. It would be absurd to try to translate\nsentences containing the word ‘brain’ or the word\n‘sensation’ into sentences about electrons, protons and so\non. Nor can we so translate sentences containing the word\n‘tree’. After all ‘tree’ is largely learned\nostensively, and is not even part of botanical classification. If we\nwere small enough a dandelion might count as a tree. Nevertheless a\nphysicalist could say that trees are complicated physical mechanisms.\nThe physicalist will deny strong emergence in the sense of some\nphilosophers, such as Samuel Alexander and possibly C.D. Broad . The\nlatter remarked (Broad 1937) that as far as was known at that time the\nproperties of common salt cannot be deduced from the properties of\nsodium in isolation and of chlorine in isolation. (He put it too\nepistemologically: chaos theory shows that even in a deterministic\ntheory physical consequences can outrun predictability.) Of course the\nphysicalist will not deny the harmless sense of \"emergence\" in which an\napparatus is not just a jumble of its parts (Smart 1981).\n\n\n\nThe identity theory as I understand it here goes back to U.T. Place\nand Herbert Feigl in the 1950s. Historically philosophers and\nscientists, for example Leucippus, Hobbes, La Mettrie, and d'Holbach,\nas well as Karl Vogt who, following Pierre-Jean-Georges Cabanis, made\nthe preposterous remark (perhaps not meant to be taken too seriously)\nthat the brain secretes thought as the liver secretes bile, have\nembraced materialism. However, here I shall date interest in the\nidentity theory from the pioneering papers ‘Is Consciousness a\nBrain Process?’ by U.T. Place (Place 1956) and H.  Feigl\n‘The \"Mental\" and the \"Physical\"’ (Feigl 1958).\nNevertheless mention should be made of suggestions by Rudolf Carnap\n(1932, p. 127), H. Reichenbach (1938) and M. Schlick (1935).\nReichenbach said that mental events can be identified by the\ncorresponding stimuli and responses much as the (possibly unknown)\ninternal state of a photo-electric cell can be identified by the\nstimulus (light falling on it) and response (electric current flowing)\nfrom it. In both cases the internal states can be physical states.\nHowever Carnap did regard the identity as a linguistic recommendation\nrather than as asserting a question of fact. See his ‘Herbert\nFeigl on Physicalism’ in Schilpp (1963), especially p. 886. The\npsychologist E.G. Boring (1933) may well have been the first to use\nthe term ‘identity theory’. See Place (1990). \n\nPlace's very original and pioneering paper was written after\ndiscussions at the University of Adelaide with J.J.C. Smart and C.B.\nMartin. For recollections of Martin's contributions to the discussion\nsee Place (1989) ‘Low Claim Assertions’ in Heil (1989).\nSmart at the time argued for a behaviourist position in which mental\nevents were elucidated purely in terms of hypothetical propositions\nabout behaviour, as well as first person reports of experiences which\nGilbert Ryle regarded as ‘avowals’. Avowals were thought of\nas mere pieces of behaviour, as if saying that one had a pain was just\ndoing a sophisticated sort of wince. Smart saw Ryle's theory as\nfriendly to physicalism though that was not part of Ryle's motivation.\nSmart hoped that the hypotheticals would ultimately be explained by\nneuroscience and cybernetics. Being unable to refute Place, and\nrecognizing the unsatisfactoriness of Ryle's treatment of inner\nexperience, to some extent recognized by Ryle himself (Ryle 1949, p.\n240), Smart soon became converted to Place's view (Smart 1959). In this\nhe was also encouraged and influenced by Feigl's ‘\"The Mental\"\nand the \"Physical\" ’ (Feigl 1958, 1967). Feigl's wide ranging\ncontribution covered many problems, including those connected with\nintentionality, and he introduced the useful term ‘nomological\ndanglers’ for the dualists' supposed mental-physical\ncorrelations. They would dangle from the nomological net of physical\nscience and should strike one as implausible excrescences on the fair\nface of science. Feigl (1967) contains a valuable\n‘Postscript’. \n\nPlace spoke of constitution rather than of identity. One of his\nexamples is ‘This table is an old packing case’. Another is\n‘lightning is an electric discharge’. Indeed this latter\nwas foreshadowed by Place in his earlier paper ‘The Concept of\nHeed’ (Place 1954), in which he took issue with Ryle's\nbehaviourism as it applied to concepts of consciousness, sensation and\nimagery. Place remarked (p. 255)  \n\nIt should be noticed that Place was using the word\n‘logical’ in the way that it was used at Oxford at the\ntime, not in the way that it is normally used now. One objection was\nthat ‘sensation’ does not mean the same as ‘brain\nprocess’. Place's reply was to point out that ‘this\ntable’ does not mean the same as ‘this old packing\ncase’ and ‘lightning’ does not mean the same as\n‘motion of electric charges’. We find out whether this is a\ntable in a different way from the way in which we find out that it is\nan old packing case. We find out whether a thing is lightning by\nlooking and that it is a motion of electric charges by theory and\nexperiment. This does not prevent the table being identical to the old\npacking case and the perceived lightning being nothing other than an\nelectric discharge. Feigl and Smart put the matter more in terms of the\ndistinction between meaning and reference. ‘Sensation’ and\n‘brain process’ may differ in meaning and yet have the same\nreference. ‘Very bright planet seen in the morning’ and\n‘very bright planet seen in the evening’ both refer to the\nsame entity Venus. (Of course these expressions could be\nconstrued as referring to different things, different sequences of\ntemporal stages of Venus, but not necessarily or most naturally so.)  \n\nThere did seem to be a tendency among philosophers to have thought\nthat identity statements needed to be necessary and a priori truths.\nHowever identity theorists have treated ‘sensations are brain\nprocesses’ as contingent. We had to find out that the\nidentity holds. Aristotle, after all, thought that the brain was for\ncooling the blood. Descartes thought that consciousness is\nimmaterial. \n\nIt was sometimes objected that sensation statements are incorrigible\nwhereas statements about brains are corrigible. The inference was made\nthat there must be something different about sensations. Ryle and in\neffect Wittgenstein toyed with the attractive but quite implausible\nnotion that ostensible reports of immediate experience are not really\nreports but are ‘avowals’, as if my report that I have\ntoothache is just a sophisticated sort of wince. Place, influenced by\nMartin, was able to explain the relative incorrigibility of sensation\nstatements by their low claims: ‘I see a bent oar’ makes a\nbigger claim than ‘It looks to me that there is a bent\noar’. Nevertheless my sensation and my putative awareness of the\nsensation are distinct existences and so, by Hume's principle, it must\nbe possible for one to occur without the other. One should deny\nanything other than a relative incorrigibility (Place 1989). \n\nAs remarked above, Place preferred to express the theory by the\nnotion of constitution, whereas Smart preferred to make prominent the\nnotion of identity as it occurs in the axioms of identity in logic. So\nSmart had to say that if sensation X is identical to brain process Y\nthen if Y is between my ears and is straight or circular (absurdly to\noversimplify) then the sensation X is between my ears and is straight\nor circular. Of course it is not presented to us as such in experience.\nPerhaps only the neuroscientist could know that it is straight or\ncircular. The professor of anatomy might be identical with the dean of\nthe medical school. A visitor might know that the professor hiccups in\nlectures but not know that the dean hiccups in lectures. \n\nSomeone might object that the dean of the medical school does not\nqua dean hiccup in lectures. Qua dean he goes to\nmeetings with the vice-chancellor. This is not to the point but there\nis a point behind it. This is that the property of being the\nprofessor of anatomy is not identical with the property of\nbeing the dean of the medical school. The question might be asked, that\neven if sensations are identical with brain processes, are there not\nintrospected non-physical properties of sensations that are not\nidentical with properties of brain processes? How would a physicalist\nidentity theorist deal with this? The answer (Smart 1959) is that the\nproperties of experiences are ‘topic neutral’. Smart\nadapted the words ‘topic-neutral’ from Ryle, who used them\nto characterise words such as ‘if, ‘or’,\n‘and’, ‘not’, ‘because’. If you\noverheard only these words in a conversation you would not be able to\ntell whether the conversation was one of mathematics, physics, geology,\nhistory, theology, or any other subject. Smart used the words\n‘topic neutral’ in the narrower sense of being neutral\nbetween physicalism and dualism. For example ‘going on’,\n‘occurring’, ‘intermittent’,\n‘waxing’, ‘waning’ are topic neutral. So is\n‘me’ in so far as it refers to the utterer of the sentence\nin question. Thus to say that a sensation is caused by lightning or the\npresence of a cabbage before my eyes leaves it open as to whether the\nsensation is non-physical as the dualist believes or is physical as the\nmaterialist believes. This sentence also is neutral as to whether the\nproperties of the sensation are physical or whether some of them are\nirreducibly psychical. To see how this idea can be applied to the\npresent purpose let us consider the following example.  \n\nSuppose that I have a yellow, green and purple striped mental image.\nWe may also introduce the philosophical term ‘sense datum’\nto cover the case of seeing or seeming to see something yellow, green\nand purple: we say that we have a yellow, green and purple sense datum.\nThat is I would see or seem to see, for example, a flag or an array of\nlamps which is green, yellow and purple striped. Suppose also, as seems\nplausible, that there is nothing yellow, green and purple striped in\nthe brain. Thus it is important for identity theorists to say (as\nindeed they have done) that sense data and images are not part of the\nfurniture of the world. ‘I have a green sense datum’ is\nreally just a way of saying that I see or seem to see something that\nreally is green. This move should not be seen as merely an ad\nhoc device, since Ryle and J.L. Austin, in effect Wittgenstein,\nand others had provided arguments, as when Ryle argued that mental\nimages were not a sort of ghostly picture postcard. Place characterised\nthe fallacy of thinking that when we perceive something green we are\nperceiving something green in the mind as ‘the phenomenological\nfallacy’. He characterizes this fallacy (Place 1956): \n\nOf course, as Smart recognised, this leaves the identity theory\ndependent on a physicalist account of colour . His early account of\ncolour (1961) was too behaviourist, and could not deal, for example,\nwith the reversed spectrum problem, but he later gave a realist and\nobjectivist account (Smart 1975). Armstrong had been realist about\ncolour but Smart worried that if so colour would be a very\nidiosyncratic and disjunctive concept, of no cosmic importance, of no\ninterest to extraterrestrials (for instance) who had different visual\nsystems. Prompted by Lewis in conversation Smart came to realize that\nthis was no objection to colours being objective properties.  \n\nOne first gives the notion of a normal human percipient with respect\nto colour for which there are objective tests in terms of ability to\nmake discriminations with respect to colour. This can be done without\ncircularity. Thus ‘discriminate with respect to colour’ is\na more primitive notion than is that of colour. (Compare the way that\nin set theory ‘equinumerous’ is antecedent to\n‘number’.) Then Smart elucidated the notion of colour in\nterms of the discriminations with respect to colour of normal human\npercipients in normal conditions (say cloudy Scottish daylight). This\naccount of colour may be disjunctive and idiosyncratic. (Maxwell's\nequations might be of interest to Alpha Centaurians but hardly our\ncolour concepts.) Anthropocentric and disjunctive they may be, but\nobjective none the less. David R. Hilbert (1987) identifies colours\nwith reflectances, thus reducing the idiosyncrasy and disjunctiveness.\nA few epicycles are easily added to deal with radiated light, the\ncolours of rainbows or the sun at sunset and the colours due to\ndiffraction from feathers. John Locke was on the right track in making\nthe secondary qualities objective as powers in the object, but erred in\nmaking these powers to be powers to produce ideas in the mind rather\nthan to make behavioural discriminations. (Also Smart would say that if\npowers are dispositions we should treat the secondary qualities as the\ncategorical bases of these powers, e.g. in the case of colours\nproperties of the surfaces of objects.) Locke's view suggested that the\nideas have mysterious qualia observed on the screen of an internal\nmental theatre. However to do Locke justice he does not talk in effect\nof ‘red ideas’ but of ‘ideas of red’.\nPhilosophers who elucidate ‘is red’ in terms of\n‘looks red’ have the matter the wrong way round (Smart\n1995). \n\nLet us return to the issue of us having a yellow, purple and green\nstriped sense datum or mental image and yet there being no yellow,\npurple and green striped thing in the brain. The identity theorist\n(Smart 1959) can say that sense data and images are not real things in\nthe world: they are like the average plumber. Sentences ostensibly\nabout the average plumber can be translated into, or elucidated in\nterms of, sentences about plumbers. So also there is having a green\nsense datum or image but not sense data or images, and the having of a\ngreen sense datum or image is not itself green. So it can, so far as\nthis goes, easily be a brain process which is not green either. \n\nThus Place (1956, p. 49): \n\nand Smart (1959) says: \n\nQuoting these passages, David Chalmers (1996, p. 360) objects that\nif ‘something is going on’ is construed broadly enough it\nis inadequate, and if it is construed narrowly enough to cover only\nexperiential states (or processes) it is not sufficient for the\nconclusion. Smart would counter this by stressing the word\n‘typically’. Of course a lot of things go on in me when I\nhave a yellow after image (for example my heart is pumping blood\nthrough my brain). However they do not typically go on then:\nthey go on at other times too. Against Place Chalmers says that the\nword ‘experience’ is unanalysed and so Place's analysis is\ninsufficient towards establishing an identity between sensations and\nbrain processes. As against Smart he says that leaving the word\n‘experience’ out of the analysis renders it inadequate.\nThat is, he does not accept the ‘topic-neutral’ analysis.\nSmart hopes, and Chalmers denies, that the account in terms of\n‘typically of’ saves the topic-neutral analysis. In defence\nof Place one might perhaps say that it is not clear that the word\n‘experience’ cannot be given a topic neutral analysis,\nperhaps building on Farrell (1950). If we do not need the word\n‘experience’ neither do we need the word\n‘mental’. Rosenthal (1994) complains (against the identity\ntheorist) that experiences have some characteristically mental\nproperties, and that ‘We inevitably lose the distinctively mental\nif we construe these properties as neither physical nor mental’.\nOf course to be topic neutral is to be able to be both physical and\nmental, just as arithmetic is. There is no need for the word\n‘mental’ itself to occur in the topic neutral formula.\n‘Mental’, as Ryle (1949) suggests, in its ordinary use is a\nrather grab-bag term, ‘mental arithmetic’, ‘mental\nillness’, etc. with which an identity theorist finds no\ntrouble. \n\nIn their accounts of mind, David Lewis and D.M. Armstrong emphasise the\nnotion of causality. Lewis's 1966 was a particularly clear headed\npresentation of the identity theory in which he says (I here refer to\nthe reprint in Lewis 1983, p. 100):  \n\nSimilarly, Robert Kirk (1999) has argued for the impossibility of\nzombies. If the supposed zombie has all the behavioural and neural\nproperties ascribed to it by those who argue from the possibility of\nzombies against materialism, then the zombie is conscious and so not a\nzombie. \n\nThus there is no need for explicit use of Ockham's Razor as in Smart\n(1959) though not in Place (1956). (See Place 1960.) Lewis's paper was\nextremely valuable and already there are hints of a marriage between\nthe identity theory of mind and so-called ‘functionalist’\nideas that are explicit in Lewis 1972 and 1994. In his 1972\n(‘Psychophysical and Theoretical Identifications’) he\napplies ideas in his more formal paper ‘How to Define Theoretical\nTerms’ (1970). Folk psychology contains words such as\n‘sensation’, ‘perceive’, ‘belief,\n‘desire’, ‘emotion’, etc. which we recognise as\npsychological. Words for colours, smells, sounds, tastes and so on also\noccur. One can regard common sense platitudes containing both these\nsorts of these words as constituting a theory and we can take them as\ntheoretical terms of common sense psychology and thus as denoting\nwhatever entities or sorts of entities uniquely realise the theory.\nThen if certain neural states do so too (as we believe) then the mental\nstates must be these neural states. In his 1994 he allows for tact in\nextracting a consistent theory from common sense. One cannot\nuncritically collect platitudes, just as in producing a grammar,\nimplicit in our speech patterns, one must allow for departures from\nwhat on our best theory would constitute grammaticality. \n\nA great advantage of this approach over the early identity theory is\nits holism. Two features of this holism should be noted. One is that\nthe approach is able to allow for the causal interactions between brain\nstates and processes themselves, as well as in the case of external\nstimuli and responses. Another is the ability to draw on the notion of\nRamseyfication of a theory. F.P. Ramsey had shown how to replace the\ntheoretical terms of a theory such as ‘the property of being an\nelectron’ by ‘the property X such that...’. so that\nwhen this is done for all the theoretical terms, we are left only with\n‘property X such that’, ‘property Y such that’\netc. Take the terms describing behaviour as the observation terms and\npsychological terms as the theoretical ones of folk psychology. Then\nRamseyfication shows that folk psychology is compatible with\nmaterialism. This seems right, though perhaps the earlier identity\ntheory deals more directly with reports of immediate experience. \n\nThe causal approach was also characteristic of D.M. Armstrong's\ncareful conceptual analysis of mental states and processes, such as\nperception and the secondary qualities, sensation, consciousness,\nbelief, desire, emotion, voluntary action, in his A Materialist\nTheory of the Mind (1968a) with a second edition (1993) containing\na valuable new preface. Parts I and II of this book are concerned with\nconceptual analysis, paving the way for a contingent identification of\nmental states and processes with material ones. As had Brian Medlin, in\nan impressive critique of Ryle and defence of materialism (Medlin\n1967), Armstrong preferred to describe the identity theory as\n‘Central State Materialism’. Independently of Armstrong and\nLewis, Medlin's central state materialism depended, as theirs did, on a\ncausal analysis of concepts of mental states and processes. See Medlin\n1967, and 1969 (including endnote 1). \n\nMention should particularly be made here of two of Armstrong's other\nbooks, one on perception (1961), and one on bodily sensations, (1962).\nArmstrong thought of perception as coming to believe by means of\nthe senses (compare also Pitcher 1971). This combines the\nadvantages of Direct Realism with hospitality towards the scientific\ncausal story which had been thought to have supported the earlier\nrepresentative theory of perception. Armstrong regarded bodily\nsensations as perceptions of states of our body. Of course the latter\nmay be mixed up with emotional states, as an itch may include a\npropensity to scratch, and contrariwise in exceptional circumstances\npain may be felt without distress. However, Armstrong sees the central\nnotion here as that of perception. This suggests a terminological\nproblem. Smart had talked of visual sensations. These were not\nperceptions but something which occurred in perception. So in\nthis sense of ‘sensation’ there should be bodily\nsensation sensations. The ambiguity could perhaps be resolved by using\nthe word ‘sensing’ in the context of ‘visual’,\n‘auditory’, ‘tactile’ and ‘bodily’,\nso that bodily sensations would be perceivings which involved\nintrospectible ‘sensings’. These bodily sensations are\nperceptions and there can be misperceptions as when a person with his\nfoot amputated can think that he has a pain in the foot. He has a\nsensing ‘having a pain in the foot’ but the world does not\ncontain a pain in the foot, just as it does not contain sense data or\nimages but does contain havings of sense data and of images. \n\nArmstrong's central state materialism involved identifying beliefs\nand desires with states of the brain (1968a). Smart came to agree with\nthis. On the other hand Place resisted the proposal to extend the\nidentity theory to dispositional states such as beliefs and desires. He\nstressed that we do not have privileged access to our beliefs and\ndesires. Like Ryle he thought of beliefs and desires as to be\nelucidated by means of hypothetical statements about behaviour and gave\nthe analogy of the horsepower of a car (Place 1967). However he held\nthat the dispute here is not so much about the neural basis of mental\nstates as about the nature of dispositions. His views on dispositions\nare argued at length in his debate with Armstrong and Martin\n(Armstrong, Martin and Place, T. Crane (ed.) 1996). Perhaps we can be\nrelaxed about whether mental states such as beliefs and desires are\ndispositions or are topic neutrally described neurophysiological states\nand return to what seems to be the more difficult issue of\nconsciousness. Causal identity theories are closely related to\nFunctionalism, to be discussed in the next section. Smart had been wary\nof the notion of causality in metaphysics believing that it had no\nplace in theoretical physics. However even so he should have admitted\nit in folk psychology and also in scientific psychology and biology\ngenerally, in which physics and chemistry are applied to explain\ngeneralisations rather than strict laws. If folk psychology uses the\nnotion of causality, it is no matter if it is what Quine has called\nsecond grade discourse, involving the very contextual notions of\nmodality. \n\nIt has commonly been thought that the identity theory has been\nsuperseded by a theory called ‘functionalism’. It could be\nargued that functionalists greatly exaggerate their difference from\nidentity theorists. Indeed some philosophers, such as Lewis (1972 and\n1994) and Jackson, Pargetter and Prior (1982), have seen functionalism\nas a route towards an identity theory.  \n\nLike Lewis and Armstrong, functionalists define mental states and\nprocesses in terms of their causal relations to behaviour but stop\nshort of identifying them with their neural realisations. Of course the\nterm ‘functionalism’ has been used vaguely and in different\nways, and it could be argued that even the theories of Place, Smart and\nArmstrong were at bottom functionalist. The word\n‘functionalist’ has affinities with that of\n‘function’ in mathematics and also with that of\n‘function’ in biology. In mathematics a function is a set\nof ordered n-tuples. Similarly if mental processes are defined directly\nor indirectly by sets of stimulus-response pairs the definitions could\nbe seen as ‘functional’ in the mathematical sense. However\nthere is probably a closer connection with the term as it is used in\nbiology, as one might define ‘eye’ by its function even\nthough a fly's eye and a dog's eye are anatomically and physiologically\nvery different. Functionalism identifies mental states and processes by\nmeans of their causal roles, and as noted above in connection with\nLewis, we know that the functional roles are possessed by neural states\nand processes. (There are teleological and homuncular forms of\nfunctionalism, which I do not consider here.) Nevertheless an\ninteractionist dualist such as the eminent neurophysiologist Sir John\nEccles would (implausibly for most of us) deny that all functional\nroles are so possessed. One might think of folk psychology, and indeed\nmuch of cognitive science too, as analogous to a ‘block\ndiagram’ in electronics. A box in the diagram might be labelled\n(say) ‘intermediate frequency amplifier’ while remaining)\nneutral as to the exact circuit and whether the amplification is\ncarried out by a thermionic valve or by a transistor. Using terminology\nof F. Jackson and P. Pettit (1988, pp. 381–400) the ‘role\nstate’ would be given by ‘amplifier’, the\n‘realiser state’ would be given by ‘thermionic\nvalve’, say. So we can think of functionalism as a ‘black\nbox’ theory. This line of thought will be pursued in the next\nsection. \n\nThinking very much in causal terms about beliefs and desires fits in\nvery well not only with folk psychology but also with Humean ideas\nabout the motives of action. Though this point of view has been\ncriticised by some philosophers it does seem to be right, as can be\nseen if we consider a possible robot aeroplane designed to find its way\nfrom Melbourne to Sydney. The designer would have to include an\nelectronic version of something like a map of south-eastern Australia.\nThis would provide the ‘belief’ side. One would also have\nto program in an electronic equivalent of ‘go to Sydney’.\nThis program would provide the ‘desire’ side. If wind and\nweather pushed the aeroplane off course then negative feedback would\npush the aeroplane back on to the right course for Sydney. The\nexistence of purposive mechanisms has at last (I hope) shown to\nphilosophers that there is nothing mysterious about teleology. Nor are\nthere any great semantic problems over intentionality (with a\n‘t’). Consider the sentence ‘Joe desires a\nunicorn’. This is not like ‘Joe kicks a football’.\nFor Joe to kick a football there must be a football to be kicked, but\nthere are no unicorns. However we can say ‘Joe desires-true of\nhimself \"possesses a unicorn\" ’. Or more generally ‘Joe\nbelieves-true S’ or ‘Joe desires-true S’ where S is\nan appropriate sentence (Quine 1960, pp. 206–16). Of course if one does\nnot want to relativise to a language one needs to insert ‘or some\nsamesayer of S’ or use the word ‘proposition’, and\nthis involves the notion of proposition or intertranslatability. Even\nif one does not accept Quine's notion of indeterminacy of translation,\nthere is still fuzziness in the notions of ‘belief’ and\n‘desire’ arising from the fuzziness of\n‘analyticity’ and ‘synonymy’. The identity\ntheorist could say that on any occasion this fuzziness is matched by\nthe fuzziness of the brain state that constitutes the belief or desire.\nJust how many interconnections are involved in a belief or desire? On a\nholistic account such as Lewis's one need not suppose that\nindividuation of beliefs and desires is precise, even though good\nenough for folk psychology and Humean metaethics. Thus the way in which\nthe brain represents the world might not be like a language. The\nrepresentation might be like a map. A map relates every feature on it\nto every other feature. Nevertheless maps contain a finite amount of\ninformation. They have not infinitely many parts, still less continuum\nmany. We can think of beliefs as expressing the different bits of\ninformation that could be extracted from the map. Thinking in this way\nbeliefs would correspond near enough to the individualist beliefs\ncharacteristic of folk and Humean psychology. \n\nThe notion ‘type’ and ‘token’ here comes by\nanalogy from ‘type’ and ‘token’ as applied to\nwords. A telegram ‘love and love and love’ contains only\ntwo type words but in another sense, as the telegraph clerk would\ninsist, it contains five words (‘token words’). Similarly a\nparticular pain (more exactly a having a pain) according to the token\nidentity theory is identical to a particular brain process. A\nfunctionalist could agree to this. Functionalism came to be seen as an\nimprovement on the identity theory, and as inconsistent with it,\nbecause of the correct assertion that a functional state can be\nrealised by quite different brain states: thus a functional state might\nbe realised by a silicon based brain as well as by a carbon based\nbrain, and leaving robotics or science fiction aside, my feeling of\ntoothache could be realised by a different neural process from what\nrealises your toothache.  \n\nAs far as this goes a functionalist can at any rate accept token\nidentities. Functionalists commonly deny type identities. However\nJackson, Pargetter and Prior (1982) and Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson\n(1996) argue that this is an over-reaction on the part of the\nfunctionalist. (Indeed they see functionalism as a route to the\nidentity theory.) The functionalist may define mental states as having\nsome state or other (e.g., carbon based or silicon based) which\naccounts for the functional properties. The functionalist second order\nstate is a state of having some first order state or other which causes\nor is caused by the behaviour to which the functionalist alludes. In\nthis way we have a second order type theory. Compare brittleness. The\nbrittleness of glass and the brittleness of biscuits are both the state\nof having some property which explains their breaking, though the first\norder physical property may be different in the two cases. This way of\nlooking at the matter is perhaps more plausible in relation to mental\nstates such as beliefs and desires than it is to immediately reported\nexperiences. When I report a toothache I do seem to be concerned with\nfirst order properties, even though topic neutral ones. \n\nIf we continue to concern ourselves with first order properties, we\ncould say that the type-token distinction is not an all or nothing\naffair. We could say that human experiences are brain processes of one\nlot of sorts and Alpha Centaurian experiences are brain processes of\nanother lot of sorts. We could indeed propose much finer\nclassifications without going to the limit of mere token\nidentities. \n\nHow restricted should be the restriction of a restricted type\ntheory? How many hairs must a bald man have no more of? An identity\ntheorist would expect his toothache today to be very similar to his\ntoothache yesterday. He would expect his toothache to be quite similar\nto his wife's toothache. He would expect his toothache to be somewhat\nsimilar to his cat's toothache. He would not be confident about\nsimilarity to an extra-terrestrial's pain. Even here, however, he might\nexpect some similarities of wave form or the like. \n\nEven in the case of the similarity of my pain now to my pain ten\nminutes ago, there will be unimportant dissimilarities, and also\nbetween my pain and your pain. Compare topiary, making use of an\nanalogy exploited by Quine in a different connection. In English\ncountry gardens the tops of box hedges are often cut in various shapes,\nfor example peacock shapes. One might make generalizations about\npeacock shapes on box hedges, and one might say that all the imitation\npeacocks on a particular hedge have the same shape. However if we\napproach the two imitation peacocks and peer into them to note the\nprecise shapes of the twigs that make them up we will find differences.\nWhether we say that two things are similar or not is a matter of\nabstractness of description. If we were to go to the limit of\nconcreteness the types would shrink to single membered types, but there\nwould still be no ontological difference between identity theory and\nfunctionalism. \n\nAn interesting form of token identity theory is the anomalous monism\nof Davidson 1980. Davidson argues that causal relations occur under the\nneural descriptions but not under the descriptions of psychological\nlanguage. The latter descriptions use intentional predicates, but\nbecause of indeterminacy of translation and of interpretation, these\npredicates do not occur in law statements. It follows that mind-brain\nidentities can occur only on the level of individual (token) events. It\nwould be beyond the scope of the present essay to consider Davidson's\ningenious approach, since it differs importantly from the more usual\nforms of identity theory. \n\nPlace answered the question ‘Is Consciousness a Brain\nProcess?’ in the affirmative. But what sort of brain process? It\nis natural to feel that there is something ineffable about which no\nmere neurophysiological process (with only physical intrinsic\nproperties) could have. There is a challenge to the identity theorist\nto dispel this feeling.  \n\nSuppose that I am riding my bicycle from my home to the university.\nSuddenly I realise that I have crossed a bridge over a creek, gone\nalong a twisty path for half a mile, avoided oncoming traffic, and so\non, and yet have no memories of all this. In one sense I was conscious:\nI was perceiving, getting information about my position and speed, the\nstate of the bicycle track and the road, the positions and speeds of\napproaching cars, the width of the familiar narrow bridge. But in\nanother sense I was not conscious: I was on ‘automatic\npilot’. So let me use the word ‘awareness’ for this\nautomatic or subconscious sort of consciousness. Perhaps I am not one\nhundred percent on automatic pilot. For one thing I might be absent\nminded and thinking about philosophy. Still, this would not be relevant\nto my bicycle riding. One might indeed wonder whether one is ever one\nhundred percent on automatic pilot, and perhaps one hopes that one\nisn't, especially in Armstrong's example of the long distance truck\ndriver (Armstrong 1962). Still it probably does happen, and if it does\nthe driver is conscious only in the sense that he or she is alert to\nthe route, of oncoming traffic etc., i.e. is perceiving in the sense of\n‘coming to believe by means of the senses’. The driver gets\nthe beliefs but is not aware of doing so. There is no suggestion of\nineffability in this sense of ‘consciousness’, for which I\nshall reserve the term ‘awareness’. \n\nFor the full consciousness, the one that puzzles us and suggests\nineffability, we need the sense elucidated by Armstrong in a debate\nwith Norman Malcolm (Armstrong and Malcolm 1962, p. 110). Somewhat\nsimilar views have been expressed by other philosophers, such as Savage\n(1976), Dennett (1991), Lycan (1996), Rosenthal (1996). A recent\npresentation of it is in Smart (2004). In the debate with Norman\nMalcolm, Armstrong compared consciousness with proprioception. A case\nof proprioception occurs when with our eyes shut and without touch we\nare immediately aware of the angle at which one of our elbows is bent.\nThat is, proprioception is a special sense, different from that of\nbodily sensation, in which we become aware of parts of our body. Now\nthe brain is part of our body and so perhaps immediate awareness of a\nprocess in, or a state of, our brain may here for present purposes be\ncalled ‘proprioception’. Thus the proprioception even\nthough the neuroanatomy is different. Thus the proprioception which\nconstitutes consciousness, as distinguished from mere awareness, is a\nhigher order awareness, a perception of one part of (or configuration\nin) our brain by the brain itself. Some may sense circularity here. If\nso let them suppose that the proprioception occurs in an in practice\nnegligible time after the process propriocepted. Then perhaps there can\nbe proprioceptions of proprioceptions, proprioceptions of\nproprioceptions of proprioceptions, and so on up, though in fact the\nsequence will probably not go up more than two or three steps. The last\nproprioception in the sequence will not be propriocepted, and this may\nhelp to explain our sense of the ineffability of consciousness. Compare\nGilbert Ryle in The Concept of Mind on the systematic\nelusiveness of ‘I’ (Ryle 1949, pp. 195–8). \n\nPlace has argued that the function of the ‘automatic\npilot’, to which he refers as ‘the zombie within’, is\nto alert consciousness to inputs which it identifies as problematic,\nwhile it ignores non-problematic inputs or re-routes them to output\nwithout the need for conscious awareness. For this view of\nconsciousness see Place (1999). \n\nMention should here be made of influential criticisms of the identity\ntheory by Saul Kripke and David Chalmers respectively. It will not be\npossible to discuss them in great detail, partly because of the fact\nthat Kripke's remarks rely on views about modality, possible worlds\nsemantics, and essentialism which some philosophers would want to\ncontest, and because Chalmers' long and rich book would deserve a\nlengthy answer. Kripke (1980) calls an expression a rigid designator if\nit refers to the same object in every possible world. Or in counterpart\ntheory it would have an exactly similar counterpart in every possible\nworld. It seems to me that what we count as counterparts is highly\ncontextual. Take the example ‘water is H2O’. In\nanother world, or in a twin earth in our world as Putnam imagines\n(1975), the stuff found in rivers, lakes, the sea would not be\nH2O but XYZ and so would not be water. This is certainly\ngiving preference to real chemistry over folk chemistry, and so far I\napplaud this. There are therefore contexts in which we say that on twin\nearth or the envisaged possible world the stuff found in rivers would\nnot be water. Nevertheless there are contexts in which we could\nenvisage a possible world (write a science fiction novel) in which\nbeing found in rivers and lakes and the sea, assuaging thirst and\nsustaining life was more important than the chemical composition and so\nXYZ would be the counterpart of H2O.  \n\nKripke considers the identity ‘heat = molecular motion’,\nand holds that this is true in every possible world and so is a\nnecessary truth. Actually the proposition is not quite true, for what\nabout radiant heat? What about heat as defined in classical\nthermodynamics which is ‘topic neutral’ compared with\nstatistical thermodynamics? Still, suppose that heat has an essence and\nthat it is molecular motion, or at least is in the context envisaged.\nKripke says (1980, p. 151) that when we think that molecular motion\nmight exist in the absence of heat we are confusing this with thinking\nthat the molecular motion might have existed without being\nfelt as heat. He asks whether it is analogously possible that\nif pain is a certain sort of brain process that it has existed without\nbeing felt as pain. He suggests that the answer is\n‘No’. An identity theorist who accepted the account of\nconsciousness as a higher order perception could answer\n‘Yes’. We might be aware of a damaged tooth and also of\nbeing in an agitation condition (to use Ryle's term for emotional\nstates) without being aware of our awareness. An identity theorist such\nas Smart would prefer talk of ‘having a pain’ rather than\nof ‘pain’: pain is not part of the furniture of the world\nany more than a sense datum or the average plumber is. Kripke concludes\n(p. 152) that the \n\nSmart would say that there is a sense in which the connection of\nsensations (sensings) and brain processes is only half contingent. A\ncomplete description of the brain state or process (including causes\nand effects of it) would imply the report of inner experience, but the\nlatter, being topic neutral and so very abstract would not imply the\nneurological description. \n\nChalmers (1996) in the course of his exhaustive study of\nconsciousness developed a theory of non-physical qualia which to some\nextent avoids the worry about nomological danglers. The worry expressed\nby Smart (1959) is that if there were non-physical qualia there would,\nmost implausibly, have to be laws relating neurophysiological processes\nto apparently simple properties, and the correlation laws would have to\nbe fundamental, mere danglers from the nomological net (as Feigl called\nit) of science. Chalmers counters this by supposing that the qualia are\nnot simple but unknown to us, are made up of simple proto-qualia, and\nthat the fundamental laws relating these to physical entities relate\nthem to fundamental physical entities. His view comes to a\nrather interesting panpsychism. On the other hand if the topic neutral\naccount is correct, then qualia are no more than points in a\nmultidimensional similarity space, and the overwhelming plausibility\nwill fall on the side of the identity theorist. \n\nOn Chalmers' view how are we aware of non-physical qualia? It has\nbeen suggested above that this inner awareness is proprioception of the\nbrain by the brain. But what sort of story is possible in the case of\nawareness of a quale? Chalmers could have some sort of answer to this\nby means of his principle of coherence according to which the causal\nneurological story parallels the story of succession of qualia. It is\nnot clear however that this would make us aware of the qualia. The\nqualia do not seem to be needed in the physiological story of how an\nantelope avoids a tiger. \n\nPeople often think that even if a robot could scan its own\nperceptual processes this would not mean that the robot was conscious.\nThis appeals to our intuitions, but perhaps we could reverse the\nargument and say that because the robot can be aware of its awareness\nthe robot is conscious. I have given reason above to distrust\nintuitions, but in any case Chalmers comes some of the way in that he\ntoys with the idea that a thermostat has a sort of proto-qualia. The\ndispute between identity theorists (and physicalists generally) and\nChalmers comes down to our attitude to phenomenology. Certainly walking\nin a forest, seeing the blue of the sky, the green of the trees, the\nred of the track, one may find it hard to believe that our qualia are\nmerely points in a multidimensional similarity space. But perhaps that\nis what it is like (to use a phrase that can be distrusted) to\nbe aware of a point in a multidimensional similarity space. One may\nalso, as Place would suggest, be subject to ‘the phenomenological\nfallacy’. At the end of his book Chalmers makes some speculations\nabout the interpretation of quantum mechanics. If they succeed then\nperhaps we could envisage Chalmers' theory as integrated into physics\nand him as a physicalist after all. However it could be doubted whether\nwe need to go down to the quantum level to understand consciousness or\nwhether consciousness is relevant to quantum mechanics."}]
