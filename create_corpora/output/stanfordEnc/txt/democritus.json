He elaborated a system originated by his teacher\nLeucippus into a materialist account of the natural world.  The\natomists held that there are smallest indivisible bodies from which\neverything else is composed, and that these move about in an infinite\nvoid.  Of the ancient materialist accounts of the natural\nworld which did not rely on some kind of teleology or purpose to\naccount for the apparent order and regularity found in the world,\natomism was the most influential.  Even its chief critic,\nAristotle, praised Democritus for arguing from sound considerations\nappropriate to natural philosophy.\n\n\n\nAccording to ancient reports, Democritus was born about 460 BCE\n(thus, he was a younger contemporary of Socrates) and was a citizen of\nAbdera, although some reports mention Miletus.  As well as his\nassociate or teacher Leucippus, Democritus is said to have known\nAnaxagoras, and to have been forty years younger than the latter (DK\n68A1).  A number of anecdotes concern his life, but their authenticity\nis uncertain.   \n\nThe work of Democritus has survived only in secondhand reports,\nsometimes unreliable or conflicting.  Much of the best evidence is\nthat reported by Aristotle, who regarded him as an important rival in\nnatural philosophy.  Aristotle wrote a monograph on Democritus, of\nwhich only a few passages quoted in other sources have survived.\nDemocritus seems to have taken over and systematized the views of\nLeucippus, of whom little is known.  Although it is possible to\ndistinguish some contributions as those of Leucippus, the overwhelming\nmajority of reports refer either to both figures, or to Democritus\nalone; the developed atomist system is often regarded as essentially\nDemocritus'. \n\nDiogenes Laertius lists a large number of works by Democritus on\nmany fields, including ethics, physics, mathematics, music and\ncosmology.  Two works, the Great World System and the\nLittle World System (see the entry on \n  doxography of ancient philosophy), \nare sometimes ascribed to Democritus, although Theophrastus reports\nthat the former is by Leucippus (DK 68A33).  There is more uncertainty\nconcerning the authenticity of the reports of Democritus' ethical\nsayings.  Two collections of sayings are recorded in the fifth-century\nanthology of Stobaeus, one ascribed to Democritus and another ascribed\nto an otherwise unknown philosopher ‘Democrates’.  DK\naccepts both as relating to Democritus, but the authenticity of\nsayings in both collections is a matter of scholarly discussion, as is\nthe relationship between Democritus' atomism and his ethics. \n\nAncient sources describe atomism as one of a number of attempts by\nearly Greek natural philosophers to respond to the challenge offered\nby Parmenides.  Despite occasional challenges (Osborne 2004), this is\nhow its motivation is generally interpreted by scholars today.\nParmenides had argued that it is impossible for there to be change\nwithout something coming from nothing.  Since the idea that something\ncould come from nothing was generally agreed to be impossible,\nParmenides argued that change is merely illusory.  In response,\nLeucippus and Democritus, along with other Presocratic pluralists such\nas Empedocles and Anaxagoras, developed systems that made change\npossible by showing that it does not require that something should\ncome to be from nothing.  These responses to Parmenides suppose that\nthere are multiple unchanging material principles, which persist and\nmerely rearrange themselves to form the changing world of appearances.\nIn the atomist version, these unchanging material principles are\nindivisible particles, the atoms: the atomists are often thought to\nhave taken the idea that there is a lower limit to divisibility to\nanswer Zeno's paradoxes about the impossibility of traversing\ninfinitely divisible magnitudes (Hasper 2006).  Reconstructions\noffered by Wardy (1988) and Sedley (2008) argue, instead, that atomism\nwas developed as a response to Parmenidean arguments. \n\nThe atomists held that there are two fundamentally different kinds\nof realities composing the natural world, atoms and void.  Atoms, from\nthe Greek adjective atomos or atomon,\n‘indivisible,’ are infinite in number and various in size\nand shape, and perfectly solid, with no internal gaps.  They move\nabout in an infinite void, repelling one another when they collide or\ncombining into clusters by means of tiny hooks and barbs on their\nsurfaces, which become entangled.  Other than changing place, they are\nunchangeable, ungenerated and indestructible.  All changes in the\nvisible objects of the world of appearance are brought about by\nrelocations of these atoms: in Aristotelian terms, the atomists reduce\nall change to change of place.  Macroscopic objects in the world that\nwe experience are really clusters of these atoms; changes in the\nobjects we see—qualitative changes or growth, say—are\ncaused by rearrangements or additions to the atoms composing them.\nWhile the atoms are eternal, the objects compounded out of them are\nnot.  Clusters of atoms moving in the infinite void come to form\nkosmoi or worlds as a result of a circular motion that\ngathers atoms up into a whirl, creating clusters within it (DK\n68B167); these kosmoi are impermanent.  Our world and the\nspecies within it have arisen from the collision of atoms moving about\nin such a whirl, and will likewise disintegrate in time. \n\nIn supposing that void exists, the atomists deliberately embraced an\napparent contradiction, claiming that ‘what is not’\nexists.  Apparently addressing an argument by Melissus, a follower of\nParmenides, the atomists paired the term for ‘nothing’\nwith what it negates, ‘thing,’ and claimed that—in a\nphrase typical of the atomists—the one ‘no more’\nexists than the other (DK 67A6).  Schofield (2002) argues that this\nparticular phrase originated with Democritus and not his teacher\nLeucippus.  By putting the full (or solid) and the void ontologically\non a par, the atomists were apparently denying the impossibility of\nvoid.  Void they considered to be a necessary condition for local\nmotion: if there were no unoccupied places, where could bodies move\ninto?  Melissus had argued from the impossibility of void to\nthe impossibility of motion; the atomists apparently reasoned in\nreverse, arguing from the fact that motion exists to the necessity for\nvoid space to exist (DK 67A7).  It has been suggested that Democritus'\nconception of void is that of the (temporarily) unfilled regions\nbetween atoms rather than a concept of absolute space (Sedley 1982).\nVoid does not impede the motion of atoms because its essential quality\nis that of ‘yielding,’ in contrast to the mutual\nresistance of atoms.  Later atomist accounts attest that this\n‘yielding’ explains the tendency of bodies to drift into\nemptier spaces, driven out by collision from more densely packed\nregions (Lucretius DRN 6.906–1089). \n\nSome controversy surrounds the properties of the atoms.  They vary\nin size: one report—which some scholars question—suggests\nthat atoms could, in principle, be as large as a cosmos, although at\nleast in this cosmos they all seem to be too small to perceive (DK\n68A47).  They can take on an infinite variety of shapes: there are\nreports of an argument that there is ‘no more’ reason for\nthe atoms to be one shape than another.  Many kinds of atoms can\ninterlock with one another because of their irregular shapes and hooks\nat their surface, accounting for the cohesiveness of some compounds.\nIt is not clear whether the early atomists regarded atoms as\nconceptually indivisible or merely physically indivisible (Furley\n1967).  The idea that there is a smallest possible magnitude seems to\nsuggest that this is the lower limit of size for atoms, although\nnotions like being in contact or having shape seem to entail that even\nthe smallest atoms have parts in some sense, if only mathematically or\nconceptually.   \n\nThere are conflicting reports on whether atoms move in a particular\ndirection as a result of their weight: a number of scholars have tried\nto reconcile these by supposing that weight is not intrinsic to the\natoms, but is a result of the centripetal tendencies set up in the\ncosmic whirl (cf. O'Brien 1981; Furley 1989, pp. 91–102).  Atoms may\nhave an inherent tendency to a kind of vibratory motion, although the\nevidence for this is uncertain (McDiarmid 1958).  However, their\nprimary movement seems to result from collision with other atoms,\nwherein their mutual resistance or antitupia causes them to\nmove away from one another when struck.  Democritus is criticized by\nAristotle for supposing that the sequence of colliding atoms has no\nbeginning, and thus for not offering an explanation of the existence\nof atomic motion per se, even though the prior collision with\nanother atom can account for the direction of each individual atomic\nmotion (see O'Keefe 1996).  Although the ancient atomists are often\ncompared to modern ‘mechanistic’ theories, Balme warned of\nthe danger of assuming that the atomists share modern ideas about the\nnature of atomic motion, particularly the idea that motion is inertial\n(Balme 1941). \n\nAccording to different reports, Democritus ascribed the causes of\nthings to necessity, and also to chance.  Probably the latter term\nshould be understood as ‘absence of purpose’ rather than a\ndenial of necessity (Barnes 1982, pp. 423–6).  Democritus apparently\nrecognized a need to account for the fact that the disorderly motion\nof individual distinct atoms could produce an orderly cosmos in which\natoms are not just randomly scattered, but cluster to form masses of\ndistinct types.  He is reported to have relied on a tendency of\n‘like to like’ which exists in nature: just as animals of\na kind cluster together, so atoms of similar kinds cluster by size and\nshape.  He compares this to the winnowing of grains in a sieve, or the\nsorting of pebbles riffled by the tide: it is as if there\nwere a kind of attraction of like to like (DK 68B164).  Although this\nclaim has been interpreted differently (e.g. Taylor 1999b p. 188), it\nseems to be an attempt to show how an apparently ordered arrangement\ncan arise automatically, as a byproduct of the random collisions of\nbodies in motion (Furley 1989, p.  79).  No attractive forces or\npurposes need be introduced to explain the sorting by the tide or in\nthe sieve: it is probable that this is an attempt to show how\napparently orderly effects can be produced without goal-directioned\nforces or purpose. \n\nDemocritus regards the properties of atoms in combination as\nsufficient to account for the multitude of differences among the\nobjects in the world that appears to us.  Aristotle cites an analogy\nto the letters of the alphabet, which can produce a multitude of\ndifferent words from a few elements in combinations; the differences\nall stem from the shape (schêma) of the letters, as A\ndiffers from N; by their arrangement (taxis), as AN differs\nfrom NA; and by their positional orientation (thesis), as N\ndiffers from Z (DK 67A6).  These terms are Aristotle's\ninterpretation of Democritus' own terminology, which has a more\ndynamic sense (Mourelatos 2004). This passage omits differences of\nsize, perhaps because it is focused on the analogy to letters of the\nalphabet: it is quite clear from other texts that Democritus thinks\nthat atoms also differ in size. \n\nHe famously denies that perceptible qualities other than shape and\nsize (and, perhaps, weight) really exist in the atoms themselves: one\ndirect quotation surviving from Democritus claims that ‘by\nconvention sweet and by convention bitter, by convention hot, by\nconvention cold, by convention color; but in reality atoms and\nvoid’ (DK 68B9, trans. Taylor 1999a).  As Furley argues, the\ntranslation ‘convention’ should not be taken to suggest\nthat there is anything arbitrary about the perception of\ncertain colors, say: the same configuration of atoms may be regularly\nassociated with a given color.  The contrast here is intended to be\nthat between real and unreal properties (Furley 1993; cf. Barnes 1982,\npp. 370–7).  What Democritus rejects as ‘merely\nconventional’ is, perhaps, the imputation of the qualities in\nquestion to the atoms, or perhaps even to macroscopic bodies. \n\nWhile several reports of Democritus' view, apparently direct\nquotations, mention exclusively sensible qualities as being unreal, a\nreport of Plutarch includes in the list of things that exist only by\nconvention the notion of ‘combination’ or\nsunkrisis.  If this report is genuinely Democritean,\nit would broaden the scope of the claim considerably: the idea that\nany combination—by which he presumably means any cluster of\natoms—is ‘unreal’ or merely\n‘conventional’ suggests that Democritus is drawing a more\nradical distinction than that between sensible and nonsensible\nqualities.  The implication would be that anything perceived, because\nit is a perception of combinations of atoms and not atoms themselves,\nwould count as ‘unreal,’ not merely the qualia\nexperienced by means of individual sense organs.  One report indeed\nattributes to Democritus a denial that two things could become one, or\nvice versa (DK 68A42), thus suggesting that combinations are regarded\nas conventional.   \n\nCommentators differ as to the authenticity of\nPlutarch's report.  As the word sunkrisis does not occur in\nother reports, Furley (following Sandbach) suggests that it is most\nlikely an error for pikron, ‘bitter’ which occurs\ninstead in another report.  However, Furley concedes that\nPlutarch at least understands the earliest atomists to be\ncommitted to the view that all combinations of atoms, as much as\nsensible qualities, should be understood as conventional rather than\nreal (Furley 1993 pp. 76–7n7). This would suggest that everything at\nthe macroscopic level—or, strictly, everything available to\nperception—is regarded as unreal.  The ontological status of\narrangement or combination of atoms for Democritus is a vexed\nquestion, that affects our understanding of his metaphysics, his\nhistorical relationship to Melissus, and the similarity of his views\nto the modern primary-secondary quality distinction (Wardy 1988; Curd\n1998; Lee 2005; Mourelatos 2005; Pasnau 2007).  If we take the\n‘conventionality’ thesis to be restricted to sensible\nqualities, there is still an open question about Democritus' reason\nfor denying their ‘reality’ (Wardy 1988; O'Keefe 1997;\nGanson 1999). \n\nDemocritus' theory of perception depends on the claim that\neidôla or images, thin layers of atoms, are constantly\nsloughed off from the surfaces of macroscopic bodies and carried\nthrough the air.  Later atomists cite as evidence for this the gradual\nerosion of bodies over time.  These films of atoms shrink and expand;\nonly those that shrink sufficiently can enter the eye.  It is the\nimpact of these on our sense organs that enables us to perceive.\nVisible properties of macroscopic objects, like their size and shape,\nare conveyed to us by these films, which tend to be distorted as they\npass through greater distances in the air, since they are subject to\nmore collisions with air atoms.  A different or complementary account\nclaims that the object seen impresses the air by the\neidôla, and the compacted air thus conveys the image to\nthe eye (DK 68A135; Baldes 1975).  The properties perceived by other\nsenses are also conveyed by contact of some kind.  Democritus' theory\nof taste, for example, shows how different taste sensations are\nregularly produced by contact with different shapes of atoms: some\natoms are jagged and tear the tongue, creating bitter sensations, or\nare smooth and thus roll easily over the tongue, causing sensations of\nsweetness. \n\nTheophrastus, who gives us the most thorough report of Democritus'\ntheory, criticizes it for raising the expectation that the same kinds\nof atoms would always cause similar appearances.  However, it may be\nthat most explanations are directed towards the normal case\nof a typical observer, and that a different account is given as to the\nperceptions of a nontypical observer, such as someone who is\nill.  Democritus' account why honey sometimes tastes bitter to people\nwho are ill depends on two factors, neither of which undercut the\nnotion that certain atomic shapes regularly affect us in a given way.\nOne is that a given substance like honey is not quite homogeneous, but\ncontains atoms of different shapes.  While it takes its normal\ncharacter from the predominant type of atom present, there are other\natom-types present within.  The other is that our sense-organs need to\nbe suitably harmonized to admit a given atom-type, and the disposition\nof our passageways can be affected by illness or other conditions.\nThus someone who is ill may become unusually receptive to an atom-type\nthat is only a small part of honey's overall constitution.   \n\nOther observed effects, however, require a theory whereby the same\natoms can produce different effects without supposing that the\nobserver has changed.  The change must then occur in the object seen.\nThe explanation of color seems to be of this variety: Aristotle\nreports that things acquire their color by ‘turning,’\ntropê (GC 1.2, 315b34).  This is the\nDemocritean term that Aristotle had translated as\n‘position,’ thesis, i.e. one of the three\nfundamental ways in which atoms can appear differently to us.\nAristotle gives this as the reason why color is not ascribed to the\natoms themselves.  Lucretius' account of why color cannot belong to\natoms may help clarify the point here.  We are told that if the sea's\natoms were really blue, they could not undergo some change and look\nwhite (DRN 2.774–5), as when we observe the sea's surface\nchanging from blue to white.  This seems to assume that, while an\nappearance of a property P can be produced by something that is\nneither P nor not-P, nonetheless something P cannot appear not-P.\nSince atoms do not change their intrinsic properties, it seems that\nchange in a relational property, such as the relative position of\natoms, is most likely to be the cause of differing perceptions.  In\nthe shifting surface of the sea or the flutter of the pigeon with its\nirridescent neck, it is evident that the parts of the object are\nmoving and shifting in their positional relations. \n\nBy ascribing the causes of sensible qualities to relational\nproperties of atoms, Democritus forfeits the prima facie\nplausibility of claiming that things seem P because they\nare P.  Much of Theophrastus' report seems to focus on the\nneed to make it plausible that a composite can produce an appearance\nof properties it does not have.  Democritus is flying in the face of\nat least one strand of commonsense when he claims that textures\nproduce the appearance of hot or cold, impacts cause colour\nsensations.  The lists of examples offered, drawing on commonsense\nassociations or anecdotal experience, are attempts to make such claims\npersuasive.  Heat is said to be caused by spherical atoms, because\nthese move freely: the commonsense association of quick movement with\nheating is employed.  The jagged atoms associated with bitter taste\nare also said to be heat-producing: there, the association of heat\nwith friction is invoked.  It is not so much the specific intrinsic\nqualities—smooth or jagged shape—as the motion of\nthose shapes that provides the explanation.  \n\nAristotle sometimes criticizes Democritus for claiming that\nvisible, audible, olfactory and gustatory sensations are all caused by\ntouch (DK 68A119).  Quite how this affects the account of perception\nis not clear, as the sources tells us little about how touch is\nthought to work.  Democritus does not, however, seem to distinguish\nbetween touch and contact, and may take it to be unproblematic that\nbodies communicate their size, shape and surface texture by physical\nimpact.  \n\nIn common with other early ancient theories of living things,\nDemocritus seems to have used the term psychê to refer\nto that distinctive feature of living things that accounts for their\nability to perform their life-functions.  According to Aristotle,\nDemocritus regarded the soul as composed of one kind of atom, in\nparticular fire atoms.  This seems to have been because of the\nassociation of life with heat, and because spherical fire atoms are\nreadily mobile, and the soul is regarded as causing motion.\nDemocritus seems to have considered thought to be caused by physical\nmovements of atoms also.  This is sometimes taken as evidence that\nDemocritus denied the survival of a personal soul after death,\nalthough the reports are not univocal on this. \n\nOne difficulty faced by materialist theories of living things is to\naccount for the existence and regular reproduction of functionally\nadapted forms in the natural world.  Although the atomists have\nconsiderable success in making it plausible that a simple ontology of\natoms and void, with the minimal properties of the former, can account\nfor a wide variety of differences in the objects in the perceptible\nworld, and also that a number of apparently orderly effects can be\nproduced as a byproduct of disorderly atomic collisions, the kind of\nfunctional organization found in organisms is much harder to explain.\n \n\nDemocritus seems to have developed a view of reproduction according\nto which all parts of the body contribute to the seed from which the\nnew animal grows, and that both parents contribute seed (DK 68A141;\n143).  The theory seems to presuppose that the presence of some\nmaterial from each organ in the seed accounts for the development of\nthat organ in the new organism.  Parental characteristics are\ninherited when the contribution of one or other parent predominates in\nsupplying the appropriate part.  The offspring is male or female\naccording to which of the two seeds predominates in contributing\nmaterial from the genitals.  In an atomist cosmos, the existence of\nparticular species is not considered to be eternal.  Like some other\nearly materialist accounts, Democritus held that human beings arose\nfrom the earth (DK 68A139), although the reports give little\ndetail.  \n\nOne report credits Democritus and Leucippus with the view that\nthought as well as sensation are caused by images impinging on the\nbody from outside, and that thought as much as perception depends on\nimages (DK 67A30).  Thought as well as perception are described as\nchanges in the body.  Democritus apparently recognized that his view\ngives rise to an epistemological problem: it takes our knowledge of\nthe world to be derived from our sense experience, but the senses\nthemselves not to be in direct contact with the nature of things, thus\nleaving room for omission or error.  A famous fragment may be\nresponding to such a skeptical line of thought by accusing the mind of\noverthrowing the senses, though those are its only access to the truth\n(DK68B125).  Other passages talk of a gap between what we can perceive\nand what really exists (DK 68B6–10; 117).  But the fact that atoms are\nnot perceptible means that our knowledge of their properties is always\nbased on analogy from the things of the visible world.  Moreover, the\nsenses report properties that the atoms don't really possess, like\ncolors and tastes.  Thus the potential for doubt about our knowledge\nof the external world looms large.   \n\nLater philosophers adapted a Democritean phrase ou mallon\nor ‘no more’ in the argument that something that seems\nboth P and not-P is ‘no more’ P than not-P.  Arguments of\nthis form were used for sceptical purposes, citing the conflicting\nevidence of the senses in order to raise concern about our knowledge\nof the world (de Lacy 1958).  Democritus does not seem to be pursuing\na consistently skeptical program, although he does express concern\nabout the basis for our knowledge. \n\nThe idea that our knowledge is based on the reception of images\nfrom outside us is employed in Democritus' discussion of the gods,\nwherein it is clear that our knowledge of the gods comes from\neidôla or giant films of atoms with the characteristics\nwe attribute to the gods, although Democritus denies that they are\nimmortal.  Some scholars take this to be a deflationary attack on\ntraditional theology as based on mere images (Barnes 1982,\npp. 456–61), but others suppose that the theory posits that these\neidôla are really living beings (Taylor 1999a, pp.\n211–6).  Although atomism is often identified as an atheist doctrine\nin later times, it is not clear whether this is really Democritus'\nview. \n\nThe reasons for supposing that there are indivisible magnitudes\napparently stem from the problems posed by Zeno of Elea.  Some of\nZeno's paradoxes concern the difficulty of crossing a finite magnitude\nif it is understood to be infinitely divisible, i.e. composed of an\ninfinite number of parts.  The atomists may have sought to avoid these\nparadoxes by supposing that there is a limit to divisibility. \n\nIt is not clear, however, in what sense the atoms are said to be\nindivisible, and how the need for smallest magnitudes is related to\nthe claim that atoms are indivisible.  Furley suggests that the\natomists may not have distinguished between physical and theoretical\nindivisibility of the atoms (Furley 1967, p. 94).  The physical\nindivisibility of the atoms seems to be independent of the argument\nfor indivisible magnitudes, since the solidity of atoms—the fact\nthat there is no void within them—is said to be the reason why\nthey cannot be split.  The existence of void space between\natoms is cited as the reason why they can be separated: one late\nsource, Philoponus, even suggests that atoms could never actually\ntouch, lest they fuse (DK 67A7).  Whether or not Democritus himself\nsaw this consequence, it seems that atoms are taken to be indivisible\nwhatever their size.  Presumably, though, there is a smallest size of\natom, and this is thought to be enough to avoid the paradoxes of\ninfinite divisibility. \n\nA reductio ad absurdum argument reported by Aristotle\nsuggests that the atomists argued from the assumption that, if a\nmagnitude is infinitely divisible, nothing prevents it actually having\nbeen divided at every point.  The atomist then asks what would remain:\nif the answer is some extended particles, such as dust, then the\nhypothesized division has not yet been completed.  If the answer is\nnothing or points, then the question is how an extended magnitude\ncould be composed from what does not have extension (DK 68A48b,\n123). \n\nDemocritus is also said to have contributed to mathematics, and to\nhave posed a problem about the nature of the cone.  He argues that if\na cone is sliced anywhere parallel to its base, the two faces thus\nproduced must either be the same in size or different.  If they are\nthe same, however, the cone would seem to be a cylinder; but if they\nare different, the cone would turn out to have step-like rather than\ncontinuous sides.  Although it is not clear from Plutarch's report how\n(or if) Democritus solved the problem, it does seem that he was\nconscious of questions about the relationship between atomism as a\nphysical theory and the nature of mathematical objects. \n\nThe reports concerning Democritus' ethical views pose a number of\ninterpretative problems, including the difficulty of deciding which\nfragments are genuinely Democritean (see above, section 1).  In\ncontrast to the evidence for his physical theories, many of the\nethical fragments are lists of sayings quoted without context, rather\nthan critical philosophical discussions of atomist views.  Many seem\nlike commonsense platitudes that would be consistent with quite\ndifferent philosophical positions.  Thus, despite the large number of\nethical sayings, it is difficult to construct a coherent account of\nhis ethical views.  Annas notes the Socratic character of a number of\nthe sayings, and thinks there is a consistent theme about the role of\none's own intellect in happiness (Annas 2002).  The sayings contain\nelements that can be seen as anticipating the more developed ethical\nviews of Epicurus (Warren 2002).   \n\nIt is also a matter of controversy whether any conceptual link can\nbe found between atomist physics and the ethical commitments\nattributed to Democritus.  Vlastos argued that a number of features of\nDemocritus' naturalistic ethics can be traced to his materialist\naccount of the soul and his rejection of a supernatural grounding for\nethics (Vlastos 1975).  Taylor is more sceptical about the closeness\nof the connection between Democritus' ethical views and his atomist\nphysics (Taylor 1999a, pp. 232–4).  \n\nThe reports indicate that Democritus was committed to a kind of\nenlightened hedonism, in which the good was held to be an internal\nstate of mind rather than something external to it.  The good is given\nmany names, amongst them euthymia or cheerfulness, as well as\nprivative terms, e.g.  for the absence of fear.  Some fragments\nsuggest that moderation and mindfulness in one's pursuit of pleasures\nis beneficial; others focus on the need to free oneself from\ndependence on fortune by moderating desire.  Several passages focus on\nthe human ability to act on nature by means of teaching and art, and\non a notion of balance and moderation that suggests that ethics is\nconceived as an art of caring for the soul analogous to medicine's\ncare for the body (Vlastos 1975, pp. 386–94). Others discuss political\ncommunity, suggesting that there is a natural tendency to form\ncommunities.   \n\nAlthough the evidence is not certain, Democritus may be the\noriginator of an ancient theory about the historical development of\nhuman communities.  In contrast to the Hesiodic view that the human\npast included a golden age from which the present day is a decline, an\nalternative tradition that may derive from Democritus suggests that\nhuman life was originally like that of animals; it describes the\ngradual development of human communities for purposes of mutual aid,\nthe origin of language, crafts and agriculture.  Although the text in\nquestion does not mention Democritus by name, he is the most plausible\nsource (Cole 1967; Cartledge 1997). \n\nIf Democritus is the source for this theory, it suggests that he\ntook seriously the need to account for the origin of all aspects of\nthe world of our experience.  Human institutions could not be assumed\nto be permanent features or divine gifts.  The explanations offered\nsuggest that human culture developed as a response to necessity and\nthe hardships of our environment.  It has been suggested that the\nsheer infinite size of the atomist universe and thus the number of\npossible combinations and arrangements that would occur by chance\nalone are important in the development of an account that can show how\nhuman institutions arise without assuming teleological or theological\norigins (Cole 1967).  Although here, as on other questions, the\nevidence is less than certain, it is plausible that Democritus\ndeveloped a powerful and consistent explanation of much of the natural\nworld from a very few fundamentals. \n\nFor the reception and subsequent history of Democritean atomism,\nsee the related entry on ancient atomism.","contact.mail":"sberrym@interchange.ubc.ca","contact.domain":"interchange.ubc.ca"}]
