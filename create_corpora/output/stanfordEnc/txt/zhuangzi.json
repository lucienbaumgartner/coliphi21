The Zhuangzi is a compilation of his and others’\nwritings at the pinnacle of the philosophically subtle Classical\nperiod in China (5th–3rd century BC). The period was marked by humanist\nand naturalist reflections on normativity shaped by the metaphor of a\ndào—a social or a natural path. Traditional\northodoxy understood Zhuangzi as an anti-rational, credulous follower\nof a mystical Laozi. That traditional view dominated mainstream\nreadings of the text. Recent archeological discoveries have largely\nlaid that ancient orthodoxy to rest. \n\n Six centuries later, elements of Zhuangzi’s naturalism,\nalong with themes found in the text attributed to Laozi helped shape Chan\n Buddhism (Japanese Zen)—a distinctively Chinese, naturalist blend of\nDaoism and Buddhism with its emphasis on focused engagement in our\neveryday ways of life. \n\n This wide range of views of Zhuangzi stem from the style of the\ntext. Zhuangzi’s prose style is its own distinctive literary\ntreasure. The central feature is the parable, typified as a discussion\nbetween imaginary or real interlocutors. Typically short, pithy, and\namusing, his tales are both accessible and philosophically\nseductive—they both entertain and make you think. A respite from\nthe dry moralizing of Confucians, the text was always a favorite of\nthe Chinese intellectual, literati class. The Zhuangzi also\nattracts modern Western readers with its thoroughgoing naturalism,\nphilosophical subtlety, and sophisticated humor, all set in a\nstrikingly different conceptual scheme and its distant, exotic\ncontext. \n\n\nPhilosophically, Zhuangzi strikes us as more the Hume of his tradition\nthan a system builder like Plato, Aristotle or Kant. He drew skeptical\nand relativist implications from a naturalist approach to normative\nguidance. His treatment of natural dàos focused on the\nnorms governing correct use of language. His ethical relativism grew\nout of an indexical model of how natural conditions shape the norms\ngoverning the use of terms.\n\n\nThis linguistic analysis emphasized indexical contexts especially for\nthe evaluative terms of choices of natural paths of behavior\n(dàos). Zhuangzi’s foils were mainly credulous and\ndogmatic Confucian humanists, particularly the innate intuitionist\nabsolutism of a type familiar from the Mencius. He also took\nhis linguistic insights to undermine Mozi’s pragmatic utilitarian\nalternative to Confucianism. He engaged seriously with later Mohist,\nrealist, linguistic theories, both acknowledging their challenge to\nprimitive quietism (the anti-language view familiar in The\nLaozi) and yet remaining skeptical of the realist conclusion. His\nmost frequent co-discussant in the text was Hui Shi, a rival\nlinguistic relativist. \n\n\nThe following highlights the central interpretive controversies then\ndevelops a philosophical interpretation that fits the Zhuangzi into\nthe classical philosophical dialogue.\n\nZhuangzi flourished through the latter half of the 4th century BC\nroughly contemporary with Mencius, and the movement known as the\nSchool of Names (名家 ming-jia name\nschool). Zhuangzi shows familiarity with Classical Chinese\ntheories of pragmatic-semantics and makes his own theoretical\ncontributions to it. The traditionally recognized figures in this\nschool included Gongsun Long and Hui Shi—Zhuangzi’s close friend\nand most frequent direct philosophical discussant. With the recovery\nof the Later Mohist dialectical work detailing their theory of\nlanguage, we find compelling evidence that the linguistic turn in\nClassical thinking was a widespread feature of this mature phase of\nthe Classical period. The later Confucian thinker, Xunzi, follows\nZhuangzi in reacting to and incorporating this linguistic turn in his\nthinking.   Most of what we infer about Zhuangzi’s life, we draw from evidence\nwithin the Zhuangzi, although the Han biographers did speculate about\nhis place of origin (the state of Meng) his personal name (Zhou), and\nthe official posts he held (minor in Qiyuan in his home state) and\nperiod he lived (during Prince Wei reign over Chu—which ended\nabout 327 BC). Scholars have found it hard to confirm any details of\nhis life from outside this text and from his being discussed by later\nthinkers. The text itself contains scattered stories about Zhuangzi,\nbut given its frequent use of fantasy, even these we must season with\nthe salt of textual skepticism. We attribute a large chunk of the\nextant text of the Zhuangzi to “students of Zhuangzi” but\nwe have little hint of who his students were or if he even had\nstudents in any formal sense.  A scholar working around 600 years later after the fall of the Han,\nGuo Xiang (d. 312), edited and reduced what he saw as a haphazardly\naccumulated cluster of apocryphal and possibly authentic texts. He\nconcluded that many were added after the time Zhuangzi lived. Guo\nreports compressing that prior collection of writings from fifty-two\nchapters to thirty-three. This is the extant text on which our\nknowledge is based. Guo divided the chapters he had chosen into three\nsections: the “Inner Chapters” (1–7), the “Outer\nChapters” (8–22) and the “Miscellaneous Chapters”\n(23–33). He attributed only the first section to the period dating\nfrom Zhuangzi’s lifetime—hence possibly originating from\nZhuangzi himself. The second grouping may have included writings of a\n“School of Zhuangzi.” Modern scholarship assigns various\nsources of other influences found in both the second\n“outer” and final “miscellaneous”\nchapters. Graham drawing on work of the Chinese theorist, Kuan Feng\nand followed with some variation by Liu Xiaogan and Harold Roth,\ndivides these influences into roughly four variously named groups:\n However widely assumed, Zhuangzi’s authorship of any of the\n“inner” chapters remains a speculative hypothesis. Guo’s\noriginal assessment that Zhuangzi did not author any of the remaining\nsections remains conventional scholarly wisdom, but religious Daoists treat the\nentire book as a Canon—The Nánhúa Zhen-Jing.   Combining all these elements into a single volume reflects a\nfamiliar Classical pattern of embellishing the teachings of a master,\nadapting the additions to the namesake’s writing style and expanding on his\nthemes and insights in distinctive ways.  The four schools contributing to the extant\ntext shared an emphasis on natural –usually as opposed to\nsocial-cultural, dàos. Yangism or egoism largely rejected\nsocial or moral dàos on the apparent assumption that natural\nguiding dàos essentially recommend self-preserving\nbehavior. Its paradigm is the anti-social hermit. Motivation by\nself-interest was normatively prior to any conventional dào. They\npreserved their natural purity from social corruption by rejecting society’s\nmores.   Primitivism similarly rejected social and conventionally moral\ndàos (mores), but has its own conception of a natural,\npre-social, typically intuitive, way of life that supports rustic,\nagricultural, village life. It supports populist and anarchist\npolitical tendencies.  \nSyncretism does not reject social dàos per se, but does\nreject any particular dào as biased and narrow in contrast to a more,\n“rounded,” idealized, or comprehensive dào. This is often\nexpressed in an ideal observer form (the sage, perfect human, or 天\n tiannature:sky’sdào). These views tend toward epistemic\nsupernaturalism—claims to superlative cognitive or religious access\nto some transcendently correct dào. Both tend to deny that their\ncorrect dàos can be expressed and transmitted in language or\nwords.  The discussions in the “Inner Chapters,” particularly\nin the 2nd chapter, by contrast, treat language as also natural and\nsocial-conventional dàos as themselves natural dàos. It\nundermines the otherwise presupposed contrast of natural\nvs. conventional dàos. Humans are naturally social animals and\nexecute natural causal processes when their walking, speaking,\nwriting, and other practices leave marks in nature, (like a trail or a\ntext) which become physically accessible to later walkers as\nhistory (stored in memory, legend, writings, or footprints etc.).  \nThe pivotal 2nd chapter draws relativist and skeptical conclusions\nfrom its normative naturalism. It rejects the religious traditionalism\nof Confucianism and the Gaia-hypothesis implicit in the Mohist attempt\nat utilitarian naturalism. Nature provides us with many ways to go,\nbut does not favor or command our making any choices among\nthem. Shì-fēi\n 是非 (This way not that) judgments\nare made by living creatures in nature, not by\n 天\ntiānnature:sky itself. We can find guiding\nstructures, dàos, in nature but not a favored or\ndictated dào of nature.  \nLike the later syncretist chapters, the “Inner Chapter”\nZhuangists accept that social dàos are continuous with\nnatural ones, but they do not endorse any imagined or alleged,\ncomprehensive judgments from everywhere, from all natural points of\nview. The cosmic judgement from nowhere is a non-judgment.  Zhuangists\nare not committed to Laozi’s conception of an exclusive choice of\nnatural (天\ntiānsky:nature) over social\n (人 renhuman)\ndàos. They are skeptical of any claim of special access to\ncontextless guiding knowledge by alleged or self-styled sages,\n“ideal observers” or perfect exemplars of epistemic\nvirtues.  They accept language but also accept our natural capacity\nand inclination to toy with it, alter it, and mould it to our use in\nvarious situations of practical choice.  \nZhuangzi’s exemplars are butchers, musicians, cicada catchers,\nwheelmakers—exemplars of mundane and focused action\nguidance. Each is an exemplar of one of the many ways of life\n(dàos) who execute their particular specialties in a\nhighly cultivated, precise, smooth, and seemingly easily executed\nway. The imagined eclectic synthesis of all the various ways of life\ninto some total-comprehensive dào is no more than\nde-facto restatement of their co-existence in a single natural world\nas optional ways of life. The cosmos makes no judgment that they\nshould exist—though it combines them into a cosmic\ndào that is the history of everything. That the cosmos\nhas this outcome does not mean it makes a human-like choice which\nhumans could or should execute. We are ill advised to strive for skill\nin everything.  \nThe eclectics were probably the last community working with the text,\nadding to it and carrying it into later periods. The Laozi had become\nenmeshed with a ruler cult worship of The Yellow Emperor. Laozi became\nthe far more influential figure during the entire Confucian orthodoxy\nof the Han (206–220 BC). The wide range of views of Zhuangzi stem from the style of the text\nand the ways it has figured in China’s intellectual history as well as\nthe ways it was caught up in the modern interaction between China and\nthe modern, scientific West.   Zhuangzi’s style is the philosophical parable, typically a\nbrief discussion or exchange between two points of view. There is\nslight plurality of humans among the discussants joined by natural and\nimaginary creatures. Its fictional characters are usually cleverly\nnamed, some are Confucian icons (Confucius or his alleged teacher, Lao\nDan). Some discussants are animals (real and fictional fish, birds,\nsnakes), a talking skull, the wind, musicians, debaters, tigers,\ntrainers, butchers, butterflies, burglars and the myriad “pipes\nof nature.” Expressive brevity and subtlety of detail enhances\nthe impact of the often complex and elusive point of the\nparables—they seldom explicitly formulate the moral or point\nexplicitly. Most commonly, the author(s) end discussions in a doubting\ntone, a double rhetorical question or some pithy enigmatic parting\nshot. They may make their point by having the two parties walking away\nshaking their heads, agreeing only to disagree; both appreciating that\nthey barely understand one another, and yet feeling that something has\nbeen learned from the exchange.   Translation into Western languages invites biases that are hard to\navoid. The main effect is loss of the conceptual cohesion of the\noriginal, but the parables still engage our Western philosophical\ncuriosity. We get the exhilaration of immersion in an independent\nphilosophical tradition of comparable antiquity and richness. Readers\nin and out of China invariably suspect that the\nZhuangzi’s appealing style is infused with\nphilosophical genius, even as they disagree about its philosophical\nupshot. Indeed, much of the Zhuangzi’s philosophical appeal\nmay stem from its seemingly deliberate open-ended texture, the\ninterpretive malleability of its dialogues which invites, even perhaps\nrequires, us to join the author(s) in their philosophical\nreflection.   This appeal stems only partly from the quality and sophistication\nof his episodes; each illuminated a patch of philosophical territory\nending with a question for further pondering—rather like\nNietzsche or the Later Wittgenstein. Each exchange presents or\nillustrates shards of insight with open-textured conclusions—all\nlaced with Zhuangzi’s obvious joy in exploring\nparadox—particularly linguistic ones of the sort that appeal to\nanalytic Western thinkers. Each is an expression of some natural, but\nperhaps inaccessible, alternative way of life. The frequent enigmatic\nconclusions “the answer is X” leaves interpreters arguing\ncenturies later, Fermat-like, how X can be an answer—or what X\nis (e.g., “free and easy wandering,” “walking two\npaths,” “goblet words,” “clarity,” and\nso forth). Each seems easily to fit into a range of puzzles familiar\nto thinkers in both traditions. One suspects that we find the correct\ninterpretation by finding our way, like Wittgenstein’s fly, out\nof some philosophical bottle. The correct philosophy coincides with\nthe correct interpretation of Zhuangzi. The traditional religious Zhuangzi narratives placed him as the\ndisciple of Laozi, whom they regard as a quasi-divine founder of a\nmystical religion worshipping a mysterious entity translators tended\nto render as a definite descriptive term, but capitalized it as if it\nwere a singular name, “The Dào.” Compatible\nphilosophical treatments were versions of metaphysical monism,\nepistemic intuitionism (often explicitly anti-rationalist), political\nanarchism and a vague normative absolutism—follow The\nDào. The bulk of popular and religious treatments still follow\nthis interpretive line, treating Laozi as the earliest layer of\n“Daoist mystical thought” or “Lao-Zhuang”\nthought and situating Zhuangzi as his “follower.”  The story of the religious view of Zhuangzi starts a century after\nZhuangzi lived (4th century BC).  Philosophical schools were\nclosed, books burned and thought repressed during the superstitious\nQin dynasty (221–206 BC) which followed the classical\nperiod. This initiated China’s philosophical “Dark\nAge.” The more orthodox Confucian Han Dynasty (206\nBC to 220) followed. Over two decades (109–91\nBC) the Han emperor’s hereditary Grand\nHistorians, Sima Tan and Sima Qian (a father and son team), wrote an\nofficial history from the mythical Yellow Emperor (c. 3rd Millenium\nBC) to the Han.  It is in this account that the\nclassification of thinkers into three concept schools, Daoist,\nLegalist, and School of Names first occurs. Graham speculates that the\nassumption of an affiliation of Zhuangzi to Laozi may have originated\nfrom the Outer Chapters. There Zhuangzi’s students used the mythical\nteacher of Confucius, Lao Dan or Laozi, to ridicule Confucius in a\ncycle of dialogues.  A cult of Huang-Lao, worshipping the Yellow emperor and Laozi as\ndivinities, had grown up in the Qin. The father and son historians\nwere students of Huang-Lao masters.  At the fall of the Han the\nnarrative of Zhuangzi as a follower/elaborator of a semi-divine Laozi\nwas well entrenched. The post-Han resurgence, known as Neo-Daoism,\nbegan with the editing of the received edition of, first, the\nLaozi (Wang Bi 226–249) then the Zhuangzi (Guo Xiang\nd. 312 see above). Neo-Daoist discussion practices and ideas were\ninfluential in bringing Buddhist and Chinese thought into interaction\nand Daoism became enmeshed with Buddhism in the popular view\n(especially with Chinese Chan Buddhism). A Daoist\n“religion”, borrowing models of religious institutions\nfrom Buddhism (monasteries, monks and nuns) influenced discourse about\nDaoism throughout the period of Buddhist domination of the Chinese\nintellectual world (achieved gradually during the Six Dynasties period\n220–589 and extending through the Tang 618–907). Neo-Confucians from\nthe medieval period on treated Buddhism and Daoism as essentially\nsimilar religions. \nModern text theory concerning the Zhuangzi grows from two recent\ndiscoveries. The following section discusses their twin impact on our view of\nZhuangzi.   Developments at the end of the 19th and early 20th century in\nChina led Chinese intellectuals to adopt the European concept of\nphilosophy (哲學) with its implicit distinction from\nreligion. This distinction was seen as pivoting on logic—the\ntheory of proof or argument. They started to segregate their own\nwritings which seemed most like argument, inference and logic from\nthose sustained mainly by credulity and tradition. They began to sort\nout the philosophical aspects of their traditional thought from its\nmore religious and superstitious elements. Sun Yirang’s\n(1848–1908) 1897 reconstruction of the Mohist Canon provided\nconvincing evidence that analytically inspired and rigorous thinking\nhad grown up in Classical China. This example encouraged 19th century\nintellectuals like Yan Fu (1854–1921) and Liang Qichao (1873–1929).\nThey started to emphasize the ancient schools that more clearly\nrelated to the logical paradigms of Western philosophy and Mohist\nanalytics. Hu Shih (1891–1962) continued this tradition of\nreconceiving and re-centering Chinese thought away from the Confucian\nscholasticism that had dominated since the decline of Buddhism.  \nThe early 20th century logic-inspired reformation recently began to\ninfluence the interpretation of the Zhuangzi and the\nXunzi in the west, largely inspired by Angus Graham who had\nobserved that both ancient texts demonstrated a mastery of the\ntechnical vocabulary of Mohist linguistic theory. Modern philosophical\nappreciation of the Zhuangzi, probably stems from Graham’s 1969\n“[Zhuangzi]’s Essay on Seeing Things as Equal”\n(Graham 1969, predating his work on Mohism). Wryly replying to Wang\nFuzhi’s speculation that Shen Dao, not Zhuangzi had authored the\nbeloved chapter, Graham averred that whoever wrote that\nphilosophically rich text is the person we would want to think of as\nZhuangzi. Graham proposed looking at the text’s seemingly conflicting\nthoughts as analogous to the “inner dialogue” of a\nreflective thinker who formulates a view, considers then rejects\nit. Graham also noted the writer’s deep involvement and apparent\nfluency in the technical language and obscure issues arising in\nClassical Chinese theories of language which he then only beginning to\nstudy.   Graham’s outlook conflicted overtly with a traditional\nChinese narrative of a disciple Zhuangzi following a semi-divine Laozi\nin worship of The Mystical Dao. Zhuangzi, Graham quipped, didn’t\nknow he was a Daoist. Graham later argued that the internal evidence\nsuggested Zhuangzi had never seen the text of the Laozi (The\nDào Dé Jing) and probably thought of Lao Dan as a\nConfucian. Most interpretive disputes are, to a greater or lesser\ndegree, a result of the tension between Graham’s textual\narguments and the traditional Historian’s picture of Zhuangzi as a\nreligious mystical Daoist follower of the semi-divine Laozi, similarly\nworshipping “The Dào.”   Graham’s textual arguments were indirectly supported by\narcheological discoveries of different Laozi texts. The discoveries in\nthe early 1970s and 1990s together implied a relatively late date\nfor the emergence of the Laozi text—probably some years after\nZhuangzi had lived and perhaps overlapping the composition of a series\nof dialogues between Laozi and Confucius in the “Outer\nChapters” section. Graham speculated that Zhuangzi’s\nstudents, who were writing the cycle of Laozi-Confucius dialogues, may\nhave rhetorically chosen to use the legendary Lao Dan (mythical\nteacher of Confucius) to give him authority to lecture and ridicule\nthe revered master.  \nWhen we abandon the traditional identification of Zhuangzi as a Laozi\nfollower, it opens the door for speculation about his relation to the\nrelativist, linguistic theorist, Hui Shi, traditionally treated as\nbelonging to the School of Names. Christoph Harbesmeier speculated he may have\nbeen either Zhuangzi’s teacher, mentor or fellow student. If he was a\nteacher, he came to accept his student as an equal or even\nsuperior. Zhuangzi portrays him as playing a role in Zhuangzi’s\nphilosophical skill development as an intimate philosophical interlocutor and\neventually as a foil for sharpening his analysis.  Among those texts\nthat concentrate on 名\nmíngnames, Hui Shi’s ten theses mark\nhim as a relativist response to Mohist realism on the relation of\nnames and “stuff”—focusing especially on comparative and\nindexical terms.  \nWe can read Zhuangzi’s relativism, accordingly as an alternative,\narguably more reflectively subtle, indexical relativism about\n 是非\nshì-fēithis-not that\njudgments regarding choices of paths (dàos) of correct\nuse of names/words/concepts as guideposts to our\n 行 xíngwalking:behavior. This\ncan both explain Zhuangzi’s relativist direction of analysis and his\nrecognition of sound Mohist/realist responses to Hui Shi’s version of\nthat relativist direction of thought.  This article develops and\nexpands on Graham’s philosophical interpretation and emphasizes this\nrelation to Hui Shi rather than to Laozi.   Between the traditional, piously mystical Daoist religious\ninterpretation and that view’s nearest philosophical neighbors, lies\nthe bulk of the interpretive historical and religious\nliterature. Given the philosophically oriented venue of this article,\nwhat follows should not be treated as ecumenical.\n \nConfucian dàos were broadly humanist. The earliest\nversion (Confucius 551–479 BC) traced normativity to\nearlier human invention.  Metaphorical trails are left by past human\nwalkings, i.e. social practices. Language was an example of such an\ninvented social practice which intertwined with routine activities\n(rituals) to yield the correct, sage-king inspired way of\nlife—the social 道 dàopath. A\nlater version (Mencius 372–239 BC) focused on natural\nhuman psychology. The correct path is that to which our natural moral\npsychology inclines us. Humans have a\n 心 xīnheart-mind that is\nnaturally shangood-at normative choice and\npractice. Mencius may have been reacting to Mohism. Mozi (470–391\nBC) had earlier initiated a shift in focus to more\nnatural and objective, less culturally relative way of grounding\nnormative judgment.  His claim that 天\ntiānnature:sky exhibited a tendency to a\ncourse leading to human utility or well-being.  So humans should use\nthat natural norm, the 辯\nbiàndistinction between\n利害 lì-hài benefit-harm\nin constructing our social dào, including the norms of\nlanguage. Correctly using terms is using them to mark the path of cooperative\nbehaviors that lead to general human benefit—a social\n道 dàopath utilitarianism, rather than a law or rule version. Nature intends us to follow its natural\nstructures in ways that lead to universal human\n 利 lìbenefit. Ethical\nquestions thus have a single correct answer in an ideally engineered\nand shared normative linguistic practice. Mohist utilitarian\nmetaethics pointed to natural realism. Daoist primitivism (symbolized by the mythical Laozi and the\nanonymous text known as the Dàodé Jing) was, as noted\nabove, a further trend toward a broader ethical naturalism with\nanti-language absolutist implications. We should forget or ignore all\nsocial norms and practices, including linguistic ones. Utility\n(perhaps egoistic utility) does motivate our behavior as naturally as\nwater follows the paths created by natural contours of earth. Language\nshould not interfere in any way with this natural guiding interaction\nbetween us and the course(es) of nature. \nUnderstanding the Zhuangzi is made more difficult by the huge\ndifferences not only in the philosophical context, but in the\npervasive metaphors that structure and focus discussions of norms of\nbehavior in the Chinese vs Indo-European classical traditions. His\npositions invite comparisons with modern metaethical naturalism but he\ndoes not focus them with concepts linked to grammatical sentences such\nas “laws” or “rules” (sentences in\nall form) or “facts” (sentence-sized chunks of\nreality) or “properties (realities corresponding to sentence\npredicates).” Zhuangzi used the traditional 道\ndàopath metaphor together with the\ntechnical terminology developed in Mohism  of\nshì-fēithis-not that,\nbiàndistinction and\nkěpermissible.  \nThe metaphor shaping most Chinese discussions of pragmatic knowing,\nchoice and behavior was dào—a path or trail.\nQuestions we would phrase in terms of moral propositions, laws, or\nprinciples are questions about finding, choosing and following\ndàos, paths or ways. Dàos can be\nsocial or natural structures that guide us in answering practical\nquestions: what to do or how to do it. As the focus of warring Chinese\nconceptions of guidance, dào guidance has three\nphases. We must find or notice them, choose one from among those we\nnotice, and then follow or interpret the selected dào in\n 行\nxíngwalking:behavior.  We\n 辯\nbiàndistinguish, discover and recognize them; choose or approve (shìthis:right)\nthem or reject (fēinot-that:wrong ) them, and\ntreat them as kěpermissible  or not. Our\ncapacity to engage in these three processes governing natural guiding\nstructures, dàos, is an internal\ndào—our\n 德\ndévirtuosity.  Our\n 德\ndévirtuosity at interacting with the web of\ndàos reads and interprets the path-marks thus generating  our\n 行\nxíngwalking:behavior.  \nThe dào metaphor corresponds closely with the Western\ntranslation metaphor of ‘a way’ which, while ubiquitous in\nphilosophical discourse, is rarely a central focus of philosophical\nanalysis of normativity. \nThe salient differences between the two\ntraditions accounts of behavior are that the Chinese does not focus on\nsentential items (actions, events, beliefs) particularly as conclusions of belief plus desire mental arguments. Instead, it focuses on the interplay of\nnatural processes grounded in the temporally shifting distributions of 氣\nqiphysical stuff that yields path-like guidance structures for living things. \nConfucians and Mohists had their own theories of the both the right\ndàos and the right\n 德\ndévirtuosity  to use together in\nguiding behavior. Confucian dàos tended to be those\nenshrined in past practice and their version of\n 德\ndévirtuosity  tended toward the\nintuitive, typically appealing to 仁\nrénhumanity.  \nMohists advocated guiding reform of conventional social dàos\nusing a natural normative 辯\nbiàndistinction of\n 利害 lì-hàibenefit-harm. For\nMohists,\n 利害 lì-hàibenefit-harm\nwas a 天\ntiānnatural way of finding, choosing,\nreforming and interpreting social dàos. In contrast to\nConfucians, Mohists sought to elaborate their natural ways of\nselecting dào-like social practices as operational,\nobjective, measurement-like processes accessible to ordinary people\nand not subject to training and indoctrination. \nChinese linguistic analysis folded naturally into similar\nlanguage—it concerns ways of using words—dàos\n(norms) of linguistic behavior focused on word use. The more\nphilosophically inclined schools began to see such norms of the use of\nwords as underlying the explicit disagreements among schools about\nwhich norms or dàos to follow and how to follow\nthem.  \nThe discussion of norms of use are typically couched in behavioral formulations such\nas 取 qǔchoose, 舉 jǔ pick-out 可 kěassertible:admissible辯\nbiàndistinction指 zhǐpoint and\nhécombine. The core psychological attitude\nis\n 為 wéideem:do\nwhich may be expressed as a tendency (in speech, both inner and\nexpressed) to express a\n 是非 shì-fēithis-not\nthat  judgment\nregarding the use of a word. A phonetically and semantically related tendency is \n 謂 wèicalling it\nby the term. Behaviorally, it amounts to dealing with it under that word-concept. Conversely we\ncan shì or fēi the use of a name of some\ncontextual object—wèicall it or\nwéideem it properly associated with that\n名\nmíngname.  \nTo 為 wéideem:do can be either to\nexpress the category assignment in one’s behavior—either\nspeech-behavior or behaving toward the object as people would be\nexpected to, given that they assigned the object to that category. The behavior for the category would be found in the social or natural dàopath\nthey follow. A 為\nwéideem:do state is less a mental picture\nof a fact (a belief) than a disposition to treat or identify some\nobject as deserving the term in question. Instead of the western\nreality vs. appearance dialectic, Chinese discussion revolves around\nthe contrast of natural\n (天 tiānnature:sky)\ndàos and human\n (人 rénhuman) or\nsocially constructed, dàos. The human\ndàos are constructed with the help of\n 名 míngnames\nstrung together into 言\nyánlanguage. Mozi, as we noted above,\nappealed to what he regarded as a natural utility standard to judge\nthe acceptability of yánlanguage use and\nConfucius relied more on past usage ranging back to the mythical sage\nkings. Problems of justifying approvals and disapprovals of word usage\nled such later Confucians as Mencius, to rely more on cultivating an\nintuition. Since the account of cultivation typically presupposed\npractice in conformity with the social practice requiring\njustification, the threat of circularity pushed traditionalists\neventually to teach about and appeal to an allegedly innate or\npre-social human psychology. By contrast, the craft–inspired\nMohists went on to emphasize the use of measurement tools and\noperations as the standards guiding term use. They argued that such\noperational standards would be more accessible to ordinary people who\ncould rely only on their “eyes and ears.” The Confucians,\nby contrast, were forced to flip between appealing to some cultivated\nauthority and attributing an innate moral inclination to the existing\nconventional language dào to such ordinary people. \n是非\nShì-fēithis-not that judgments can\nconcern choice of a dào or the interpretive\nperformances of a chosen dào. Chinese writers\nsimilarly focused on\n 可 kěassertible:permissible\nwhich may be said of a dào, or of a permissible\nwalking of some dào—including those of language\nuse. Disagreement could be at the level of dàos, or at\nthe interpretive level—endorsing or rejecting a \n 為\nwéideem:do. The endorsing-rejecting\n 是非\nshì-fēithis-not that and \n 可 kěpermissible\nbehaviors themselves involve either choosing or interpreting\ndàos. Each time we make any of these judgments we\ncontribute to further constructing our socially shared\ndào with its implied practices of\n 名 míngnames\nuse.\n Zhuangzi conforms to the general pre-Han model, using a path\nmetaphor to discuss normativity in general. This fuels the traditional\nview of him as a Daoist. Most of his discussion, moreover, further\nconforms to the practice of focusing on social\ndàos—undermining treatment as religious disciple\nof Laozi’s insistence we follow only\n 天 tiānnaturaldàos. What links him to a naturalist theme is his\nreluctance to draw the usual contrast between natural and social\ndàos. (Is it nature? Is it man?). Human social\ndàos are natural behaviors of natural\nanimals. This grounds Zhuangzi’s pattern of talking about and with\nother equally natural creatures.  \nHumans are as natural as monkeys, birds, and fish. “How can\ndàos be hidden such that there are authentic and\nartificial?” he asks rhetorically? (Harvard Yenching\nZhuangzi Yinde hereafter HY 4/2/24–5) All the different\nsocial traditions expand the number and kinds of naturally existing\ndàos. Other animals’ walking patterns also\nconstruct natural dàos which, similarly, become\navailable for human finding, choosing and walking.  \nZhuangzi’s discussion, particularly in the philosophically\nmost sophisticated second chapter, is mainly about the plurality and\nrelativity of second-level dàos, our naturally\nendowed, internal dàosways of finding,\nchoosing and following one of many natural ways of life in the maze or\nnetwork presented by nature.  This stance makes the complexity of the\nnatural network only the first level of variety and\npossibility. Recursion of dàos explodes the\ncomplexity. A tripartite recursion follows because there are many\ndàos of finding, of choosing, and of translating the\nfirst level plethora. The many layered complexity of\ndàos of dàos yields the human sphere\nof life. “Fish interact\nin water; humans interact in dàos”\n(Ibid., HY 18/6/72)  \nHe naturalizes dàos less by attending to natural physical\nguiding structures (e.g. dàos of water) than to the\nvariety of human dàos presented by analogy to the\nvariety of creatures with different dàos. Alternately,\nhe encourages us not to assume we have found all the available ways to\nbehave or he reflects on the variety of sources of\ndàos of choice or of different capacities to catch on\nand follow within us—our different natural organs and the range\nof different ways we may train or habituate them. This complexity of\ndào structures fuels, in turn, both his skepticism of\nabsolutes, of authority, of ideal observers, of social dogmas and his\nqualified advice to leave the finding, choice and interpretation to a\nworking out from the variety of perspectives that make up the behaving\nunits in the particular circumstance. Dào choices are\nbest made from the perspective of walkers.(Ibid., HY\n4/2/33) \nThe other distinctive feature of Zhuangzi’s approach lies in the\nsophistication of his handling the issues of language in explicating\nthis natural complexity of dàos. Graham interpreted a\nfamous Zhuangzi trope (the pipes of\n 天 tiānnature:sky) as\nZhuangzi’s way of positioning language as tiān\n(natural) sound.  \nGraham elaborates: \nZhuangzi’s Daoism, thus, starts by removing\ntiānconstant nature from its role as ultimate\nnormative authority—the role it played in virtually all the\nrival accounts of which dào we should follow. All\ndàos that are practically available at the point of\nchoice for walking (actually existing dàos) are\nsimilarly tiān. Tiān (nature) generates\ndàos as it generates the\n 物 wùthing-kinds \n(humans and other animals) that find and follow them. Neither it nor\nthe cosmos can play the role of an authority, far less of an\nanthropomorphic authority commanding or dictating our choice among the\nnetwork of naturally existing\ndàos. Dàos are chosen from those found\nin nature, but none represents nature’s choice for us—none\nof the dàos in nature is the dào\nof nature.  \nDialectically, Zhuangzi’s replacement for\ntiān’s role as source of normative guidance would be the entire complex network of dào structures that permeate the natural world. He situates us at indexed points in this\nnetwork seeking paths forward from here and now, choosing\nfrom among the plethora of those accessible which, if any, to follow.  \nThe philosophical advantage of Zhuangzi’s way of discussing\ndàos, thus, does not leave him suggesting that what is\nnatural is moral (analogous to implying “ought” from\n“is”). Nature gives us a complex network of iterative\nguiding structures among which we are about to swim.  In our\nwaking hours, we continue constructing systems of contending,\nresolving and agreeing on\n 是非\nshì-fēithis-not that\njudgments—the rejected ones buried in rubble of ongoing\nconstruction of normative language marking behavioral paths. (HY\n3/2/11–13) We recognize greater and lesser models of both—the more\nreflective and engaging vs. a lazier, more wordy type. As we\nwalk through a day, we encounter attitudinal\nstates—joy, sorrow, surprise, ennui etc. We don’t know\nwhat role these play but they seem central to our choosing\nactivity—indeed to our having a perspective, an\n‘I’. (HY 3/2/11–14) \nWhen we describe that entire structure, e.g. as resembling a natural\nnetwork of links (dàos) between temporally and\nspatially indexed points we can see how it might generate talk of a\nsingle cosmic dao. All guidance is at a point in the network and\navailable to and for some emergent object—physical, living,\nanimal or human. The inner processes of seeking, choosing, and\nfollowing dàos from node to node are themselves part\nof the natural network. We are not sure what the normative point of\nour natural reactions in walking through the nature’s maze. Each step\nor utterance adds a 是非\nshì-fēithis-not that to the edifice of\nguiding discourse marking paths for ourselves and for\nothers. It’s as if there is some natural authority guiding the\nconstruction process, though we can’t see marks of its authority. We can reliably walk paths or dàos but can't see the shape of the authority. We light on paths and react with heart-mind\nresponses. That’s it. (Ibid., HY 4/2/14–16) \nHuman dàos of finding, choosing and following are\ncapacities normally attributed to the\n 心 xīnheart-mind.  Zhuangzi\nrecognizes its involvement in the construction process, but is\nskeptical of making it a kind of natural authority. It is, after all,\nonly one of the natural organs involved—our daily reactions\ninclude being directed by our stomachs, our eyes, etc. Why, Zhuangzi\nwonders, should we think they need a single authority?  (HY\n4/2/14–16) \nEven, then, if we take the\n 心 xīnheart-mind as an authority,\nit’s not clear how it can help us deal with the role of\njudgments of greater and lesser wisdom and different ways of using\n 是非\nshì-fēithis-not that.  Aren’t all the hearts\ninvolved in the evolving construction equally natural—the sages\nand the fools? (HY 4/2/21–22)   \nAny output from our 心 xīnheart-mind\n into this\nconstruction of a dào to follow from here is itself a\nproduct of our having walked one of a range of possible dàos to this point. (HY\n4/2/20) \nThere are many natural ways of finding and choosing ways. Humans\nnaturally exhibit variety in how they find or choose a course of\nbehavior.  This recursive complex of dàos of choosing\nis part of nature. No single one need be considered the\ndào of nature to the exclusion of\nothers. They may be capacities of individuals or of social groups,\nembodied in their social practices. The gestalt set of past\ncommitments and acquired inclinations to choose and interpret paths is\nanother component of our situation or location in a complex web of\ndàos. The given dàos of choice are\nwhat Zhuangzi treats as 成\nchéngconstructed/mature within our body as\nwe traverse the nodes of the network of dàos. Our\nheart-minds reach an indexed point with a given momentum vector—a\nspeed on an existing trajectory—this is our a point of view or\nperspective, complete with prior commitments to\ndàosways of appreciating and selecting\namong available paths. \nThese second-level dàos can also be chosen and walked\ncorrectly or incorrectly. Choosing an epistemic dào, in turn, depends\non other a practically available dàos for guiding that\nmeta-choice… and so on. Zhuangzi does not view it as a rational or\nlogical construction, but a complicated, multi-layered natural one. He\nspeaks of “eight 德\ndévirtuosities” involved in\nconstructing dàos and guiding expressions, starting\nwith the indexical locatives, left and right, then human relations,\nthen mores, divisions (categories?), distinctions (disputes),\ncompetition and then strife. (HY 5/2/55–6)      \nA similar recursion concerns dàos of finding and\ninterpreting dàos. This network of recursive natural\nguidance structures constitutes the complex network of natural dào. We\nrely on meta-dàos, practically available links in this\nnetwork, in choosing and in interpreting practically available\nground-level dàos. Humans navigate in a\n sea of dàos.  \nThen who or what does the choosing? Zhuangzi’s theory here is\nsimilarly detached and natural. He focuses less on the consciousness\nor subjectivity of some mental substance or cognitive self or agent,\nbut on a grammatical locus of judgment, a\n 我 wǒI:me\n within the linguistic dào structure—the\ngrammatical indexical marks a choosing point in the conceptual and\nspace-time structure. Like Hume’s self, without the naturally\noccurring grab-bag of attitudes, it would not be there to play its\nchoosing role. The 我 wǒI:me is\nsituated in a frame of reference with its own complicated 成\nchéngcommitment trajectory in the iterative\ndàos of choice. The wǒI:me\nthat knows-how is situated in existing commitments embedded in an\nindexed here-now in the network of ways it will assign to\nshì-fēithis-not that. Each\nshì-fēithis-not that it “shoots out”\nfurther commits it to a path. (The narrator had introduced the above\n“pipes of heaven” metaphor\nto describe a gestalt he describes as having “said farewell to\nmy wǒI:me.”) “Its eruptions are like a repeating\ncrossbow” expresses how it manages\n 是非\nshì-fēithis-not that\njudgments. “Its resting on them like an oath or treaty”\nexpresses how it clings to past winners, “its death is like\nautumn and winter” expresses  how it daily declines, a\nweakening brought about by this (the weight of accumulated\ncommitments?) and it cannot start the process over. “Its\nrejections are like tightening bonds” puts into language these\naging channels. As the xīnheart-mind nears\ndeath, nothing can restore its dynamism. (HY 3/2/11–13)  \nJoy, anger, sadness, pleasure, worrying, sighing, resisting, clinging,\nbeing drawn to, eschewing, launching, and committing, like music from\nempty holes, dampness generating mushrooms, these day and night\nreplace each other before us and yet none can know from what they\nemerge. Let it be! Let it be! They come from where they\nemerge—without these, there would be no 我\nwǒI:me and without a\nwǒI:me there would be no choosing. (HY\n3/2/13–14) \nFor Zhuangzi, the issue is not mind or consciousness, but the\nbehavioral inclinations and the normative authority of these\nroving indexical perspectives scattered within the natural\ndào network. Their choices of which\ndàos to walk furthers the construction (\n 成 chéngfixing)\nof our perspective for the next choice. The first level paths have a shape, but the dàos of\ncorrect choice and performance are inside the performer and not plainly visible. \nThe trend from social construction humanism toward naturalism had been\ngradual. Mozi’s argument for basing such constructions on a natural\ndistinction of benefit and harm was an early step. Graham had\nseparately theorized that Mencius developed both his response to Mozi\nand his account of the role of\n 仁 rénhumanity\nas arguments that Confucian ritual behavior had evolved from\ntiānnatural intuitive response patterns in\nthe\n 心 xīnheart-mind. This\nimplicitly endorsed Mozi’s reliance on a\ntiānnatural ground for the social\nconstruction of morality.  Graham’s Zhuangzi then addressed this Mencian response in a\npassage that extends the Hume-like skepticism about any identifiable\n“inner self”. That should be what guides the naturally occurring emotive\nreactions that are necessary for a wǒI:me\nthat chooses. It seems, he says, there must be one, but we find no\nevidence of it. We approve of behaviors and place our trust in its\nreactions but find no sign of what is authorizing or making them.  \nMozi had worried that it would be circular to appeal to intuitions about the word use in a social dào to authorize that very practice, for example Confucian ritual. Being a product\nof ritual training. acquired intuitions could not be a sufficiently\nneutral way of justifying our choosing ritual as our social\nguide. Nor could one trained practitioner have authority over another\nin resolving interpretive disputes about how to execute the ritual,\ne.g., about how to apply the terms found in ritual texts to concrete real-time\nbehaviors. He insisted we need a neutral, non-cultural or natural\nbasis for such meta-choices of social practices of choosing and interpreting practices.  \nThe narrative history of Classical thought found near the end of the\nZhuangzi (Ibid., HY 90/33/1) takes off from this\ndispute between Confucians and Mohists. It welcomes Mozi’s\nimplicit search for neutrality, universality, and greater\nobjectivity. However, the school viewed the familiar debate between a\nutilitarian and traditional morality as interminable because\nMozi’s dàoguide, like\nConfucius’s, starts from different standards, different 成\nchéngconstructed commitments to linguistic\npractices. Each relies on their past practice of judging how to use\nthe key moral 名 míngnames.\nConfucians would reject Mozi’s standards because they led to what\nConfucians view as the wrong conclusions (e.g., implied\nConfucians should abandon 義 yì moral\nrituals such as burial). The Mohists reject burial rituals because\nthey use 義 yì morality of the social\nmores reformed according to their standard of general utility.  The\npivotal statement of Zhuangzi’s position is expressed as a riff\non the relativity or dependence of 是非\nshì-fēithis-not that judgments about\nlanguage use on natural circumstances, naturally existing past\npractice, commitments and attitudinal gestalt shifts.  \nThough balanced in judging this impasse, the Zhuangzi’s\ninteresting target is the Mohist aspiration to objectivity. Many\nstories in the text target the notion that utility is a\nnaturally constant value—particularly the human utility\nthat Mozi champions. Among this series of parables, the most famous,\nthe useless tree, illustrates the relativity of usefulness to Hui\nShi. (Ibid.,  HY 3/1/46–7) \nNot only are we implicitly appealing to a dào in\nchoosing to adopt a benefit/harm standard, we are also going to appeal\nto interpretive dào to judge whether we have followed\nit correctly or not. Mozi had treated moral disputes as disagreements\nabout how to 辯 biàndistinguish in\napplying terms like 義 yìmorality and\n善 shàngood-at. He had also objected\nto Confucian reliance on acquired intuition since it made access to\nsuch judgments esoteric. He argued that standards governing such\nevaluative word use should be made by 法\nfǎmeasurement standards that are accessible\nto the “eyes and ears” of ordinary people. His utility\nstandard, Zhuangzi is suggesting, is still relative to the\nway of translating it to behavior.  \nOthers in the ethical debate, notably Yang Zhu and related\nPrimitivists, also appealed to tiān (natural constancy)\nas a normative arbiter. The growing awareness that norms of behavior\nare intertwined with norms of language use, produced another feature\nof this strand of thought bringing the natural world into our\nguidance. Primitivists came to advocate silence—letting the natural\npaths of the world take over completely.   For most of history, the Laozi has exemplified this rejection of language. It\ntreated all social 道\ndàospaths as implicit rejections of the\nnatural 道 dàopath. Graham has argued\nthat echoes of this line of thinking lay in the background of\nMencius’s thought. That concern led him to attempt to substitute\nnatural moral psychology (a natural moral disposition in human\n心 xīnheart-mind) for positive social\nmores.  \nA paradigm of this anti-language, silence trend (cited in the\nZhuangzi’s internal history just before discussing the\nLaozi group ) was Shen Dao. Shen Dao postulated a\n“Great Dào” (essentially the actual course\nof cosmic history from past to future) which “even a clod of\nearth” will follow. We all will follow Great\nDào. We can (and should) therefore abandon knowledge\nof how to make linguistic distinctions (是非\nshì-fēithis-not that judgments) to\nfollow Great Dào. Shen Dao, based on his version of\nlogical determinism (i.e., There being an actual complete history of\nspace-time entails your behavior tomorrow is included) draws an\nanti-normative, quietist and stoic conclusion. \nLater Mohist writings contain several acute critiques of such a\ntrending pro-silence posture. Deeming all 言\nyánlanguage as not-可\nkěassertible is not 可\nkěassertible. The explanation, later Mohists\nnoted, lies in the asserter’s own use of\n 言 yánlanguage. Rejecting\n(fēi-ing) all shì-fēi judgments is\nfēi (wrong, to be rejected). Similarly self-defeating is\n“teaching not to teach.”  \nZhuangzi’s “pipes of nature” metaphor signals his\ndeparture from these defective Laozi-like or Primitivist\nanti-language positions. Language is natural and arguments for silence\nare self-condemning. So the point of Zhuangzi’s own reflections on the\nabsence of natural normative endorsement of our\nshì-fēithis-not that  decisions\nshould not guide us to stop making them. Making them is what\nwe naturally do when we find our\ndàos in nature. It is natural for us to make\na judgment, but not nature making it. Normativity arises from within\nnature, but nature only makes all its normative, behavior-guiding\npaths for us naturally available. The Zhuangzi emphasizes the plurality of natural stances\nor points of view from which one may see paths of possible behavior as\n“natural.” For one of the paths to be available for\nme will be dependent on where I am and my given\ntrajectory in the network. All the appeals to\ntiānnature as an authority are right in\ninsisting their dàos are natural, but mistaken in\nusing that as a reason to deny a similar status to the\ndàos of rival normative thinkers. Tiān\ncannot serve as an arbiter of which rival norm is correct since it\nequally “puffs” all of them out. This allows each to claim\ntheir choices are of tiānnaturaldàos but does not allow them the corollary that their\nrival’s choices violate tiān. They, like us,\nconform with tiān’s constancies in being committed\nto their dàos.   \nAny\nshì-fēithis:right judgment concerning\na dào may be either a 因\nyīndependentshì, based on\nprior or enacted commitments, gestalts orientations, and inner\nprocesses or it may be an arbitrary posited (為\nwèido:deem) shì. Dependency\narises from past (chéngfixed) commitments\nto the dào structures through which we worked our way\nto our here-now. We always encounter such choices as we are\nalready engaged in walking along some dào. Those past\ndào commitments bring us to a normative stance from\nwhich successive judgments of shì-fēi and\n可 kěpermissible vs. not\nkě arise.  Zhuangzi’s pivotal illustration pairs\n是 shìthis with 彼\nbǐthat as near and far indexicals. His use of\nanother indexical here signals his view that 是\nshìthis:right used normatively as opposite\nto 非 fēinot-that:wrong is relative to\na commitment index. \nLocal justifications for having\nshì-fēithis-not that or\nkěassertible are delivered in accordance our\nchéngfixed commitment momentum along the\ndàos that guided us to this point. This relativity of\nnormative dependence underpins Zhuangzi’s mildly ironic,\nskepticism of special or extraordinary normative statuses we give to,\ne.g., sages. The skepticism must apply even to the quietist posture that\nshì-fēithis-not that judgments are\n“bad” or unnatural. We should doubt any transcendent or\nallegedly perfect, totalistic epistemic access to nature’s\ninexpressible normative know-how. There are no naturally ideal\nobservers. \nThis cautious skepticism undergirds Zhuangzi’s departure from\nthe primitivists’. He neither thinks we should conclude that we\nmust not issue shì-fēi judgments nor that we must\nreject or deny our natural, situational inclinations to\nshì-fēi. We should, however, adopt an attitude of\nepistemic modesty in making our perspective based choices and\nrecommending our interpretations to others.  That modesty arises from\nmíngdiscerning that their perspectives,\nlike ours, arise from within a immensely complex and complicated\nnatural dào structure. Epistemic modesty also\nundergirds Zhuangzi’s openness and willingness to interact with\nothers.  If nature has a point of view, it is that one in which all\nactual dàos of shì-fēi-ing in\nnature are available as natural guiding structures. Hence nature makes\nno choice that implies a more absolute, or superior normative status\non either perspective. Nature makes them possible candidate guiding\ndàos for us to choose and walk.  \nA question implicitly and repeatedly left to the reader is what\nZhuangzi means by 明\nmíngdiscerning. Does it amount to taking\nthe view of nature but of nowhere in particular or\nis it a naturally occurring, perspective on perspectives, a\nrecognition of the plurality of natural perspectives? He usually\nrecommends to our attention insights gained from realizing that our\nchoice is one among a wide range of naturally available\ndàos. He provokes us to realize that we may make\nprogress and improve our guiding perspective by simulating the guiding\nperspectives of others. Some tales, by contrast, warn us not to expect\nthe dàos of others to mesh with our capacities and\ncharacter—as with the boy from Shouling who goes to learn the\n Handan way of walking, which “cripples”\nhis original ability. Still a third outcome of the interaction, as\nwith violent gangsters, reminds us simply to keep our distance.  \nHowever, in the standard cases, we learn from simulating others’\nperspectives, choices and interpretations of the natural\ndào-structures either from projecting or\ncommunicating—sharing methods and techniques we did not grasp\nbefore (new ways to use gourds or hand-salve or find ways to\naccommodate and interact while “walking two ways”).  New\naccumulated insights about natural structures may improve our range of\noptions, from our own point of view. Learning can also help us see how\nto walk in the natural paths together without getting in the other’s\nway. \nIn understanding other’s trajectories along their\ndàos, we may judge them as correct or\nincorrect. First, we do this from our own present perspective. We\nneither judge all to be right nor all to be wrong—nor even that all\nare equal. Certainly, not all are equally worthy of our\nchoice. We need not judge that all are good choices for those\nfollowing them—only that the grounds of their choice may be\ndifferent from ours. They might still be dogmatic, careless, or\nunwarranted even given the situational grounds of their\nchoice. Nothing about the naturalness of such choices arising\nmakes them right. All this is compatible with recognizing others as\nnatural creatures guided by natural inner processes along natural\nguiding dàos.  We neither seek to follow all at once or each equally—as Hui\nShi seems to suggest. Nor do we resolve to follow none—as Shen\nDao suggests. We do judge that we might gain from being aware of and\nengaging in open exchanges—as in Zhuangzi’s dialogues.  We are more\ninclined to follow a path, and given our similarities, think we might\npursue it with benefit when we know some natural being like us found\nand followed it. And Zhuangzi clearly does ridicule the social\nmoralists (Confucians and Mohists) as well as Hui Shi for the\nnarrowness of their range of choices—their failure to appreciate\nthe richness and complexity of alternative ways of life.  \nOur tendency to appreciate and share others’ values, to mirror their\nbehavior cooperatively, together with our awareness of the wide\nvariety of perspectives, many of which we judge to be worthless,\nmistaken, or dangerous, makes it hard to treat any projected\ntranscendental, comprehensive viewpoint as the single answer.\nZhuangzi’s “pivot of\ndàos,” his “view from nowhere,”\nis not a final shì-fēi judgment.  It is the point\nprior to any shì-fēi and from which all\ndiverge. Each commitment propels us down a different path at a\nchéngfixed momentum. We rely on\nchéngfixed commitments to prior\nshì-fēi in all\nshì-fēi judgment. All\nshì-fēi are indexed within the\nnetwork. The judgment from no-where-when is no-judgment.  \nWe learn from openness and exchange because we acquire commitments\nfrom simulating others’ path following behavior. That we progress in\nsuch exchanges is something we ourselves judge, not the cosmos. No\njudgment comes from some point outside of or everywhere in the network\nof dàos. We are naturally influenced by others’\nevaluations, their judgments of our choices and their behavioral\nvirtuosity—especially when the others are our parents, perceived\nsuperiors and respected models. These, again, are the 因\nyīndependencies on which present judgments\ndepend. \nThis gives Zhuangzi’s indexical relativism a different contour\nfrom Hui Shi’s. The latter structures his analysis mainly on\ncomparatives. This leads him to a version of normative ‘error\ntheory’ –the conclusion that we should abandon normative\nsemantic distinctions as all wrong.  Since the 辯\nbiàndistinctions on which they are based\nare relative, they are unreal. Ergo, there are no real distinctions\nand the world is actually one. Any distinction making judgment, any\nshì-fēithis-not that, unnaturally\ndivides what is naturally one. Hui Shih’s Tenth Thesis is: Graham, relying on his hypothesis that Zhuangzi frequently\nconsiders positions which he later rejects, had already targeted the\nstereotype view of Zhuangzi as agreeing with Hui Shi’s\nmonism. Graham’s translation reveals the reductio that puts\nmonism in a “considered and rejected” category. It amounts\nto the self-rebutting anti-language stance targeted by the Later\nMohists—the error Zhuangzi’s naturalism of all\nperspectives (the “pipes of\nheaven”) was intended to avoid. “[H]eaven and earth were born together with me\nand the myriad things and I are one.” \nNow that we are one, can I still say anything? Now that I have called\nus one, did I succeed in not saying something? One and the saying make\ntwo, two and one make three. Proceeding from here even an expert\ncalculator cannot get to the end of it, much less a plain\nman. (HY5/2/52–54) Zhuangzi’s relativism expresses choice, commitment, and\ninterpretive performance on analogy to natural processes involved in\nfollowing a path. Commitment is setting off along a path. We have\nmomentum and a trajectory. The shape of the path combines with these\nand commits us to walk on or continue in a way that depends\non the discernible shape of the path. Walking a path involves staying\nmostly within its physical boundaries.  This account allows us\nto capture the flavor of Zhuangzi’s discussion which does not employ\nthe familiar Western sentence-based metaphors of laws, rules,\nprinciples with norms of obedience, belief or\npropositional desire.  Using the Western idiom, along with the\nassociated practical syllogism of belief-desire explanation would give\nZhuangzi the basis for a distinction between a cause and a\nreason—a distinction he seems not to draw in his talk of\n因 yīndependence. There is a kind of\ninference from dàos of choice, interpretation etc. of\na path and an internal feedback dào (our 德\ndé virtuosity at)\n“reading” external paths to guide behavior.  Zhuangzi\nwould not make that point in terms of deduction from a normative\npremise or principle. The internal and external paths themselves have\na causal and normative relation to our walking behavior. A more\nsentential focus would similarly mean describing the outcome as an\naction rather than an extended course of  walking/following\nbehavior. A sentence would state the action or the intent—rather like\nthe conclusion of a practical syllogism rather than, as as fits in\nthis metaphorical space, as performing a role in a play or or part in\na symphony. \nZhuangzi’s use of the path metaphor did extend to the\nunderstanding of language but, again, not with a focus on sententials. Rather\nthan constructing dàos in sentential form, Zhuangzi\nconstrues language in dào form. The focus of ancient\nChinese theory was on names on the analogy of path markers: “go\npast the tree, turn right and then down to the water.” Names\ntake on importance as sign-posts along physical structures. Confucian\nsocial versions emphasized the names of social roles and statuses more\nthan of natural kinds. Primitivist opposition to social\ndàos led them into the sweeping anti-naming postures\nthat Later Mohists showed to be self-condemning.  \nGraham’s interpretation of Zhuangzi’s\n pipes of nature gave him a way to evade\nthis anti-language abyss. Human language is a natural sound. Hui\nShi’s using relativist premises about names to derive an\nabsolutist monism which threatened to collapse to the primitivist\nanti-distinction, anti-naming quietism. Making everything one is\nequivalent to denying 辯\nbiàndistinctions thereby denying any real\nbasis for the shì-fēithis way-not that\nstatuses implicit in all\n名 míngnames  and\nyánwords:language. Zhuangzi’s naturalism is\nanti-dogmatic, it neither denies nor asserts any particular set of\ndistinctions as authentic. Distinctions arise from indexed here-now\npoints in the actual network of dào\nperspectives—by travelers on a trajectory along one of the\ndàos choosing\n是非 shì-fēi this-not that\nfrom among multiple possible courses of behavior afforded by the\ncosmos. The cosmos does not select which way to make the choice.  \nZhuangzi’s analogy of language and wind, however, had its own\nproblems. Graham had noted that Zhuangzi returns to the metaphor\nnearer the middle of the dialogue, noting that here Zhuangzi seems to\nbe taking back some of its implications. Having disposed of\nMencius’s appeal to intuition and Hui Shi’s attempt to\nmake everything normatively equal, he here addresses a more\nchallenging position. The Later Mohists advocated a version of\npragmatic-semantic realism. The Later Mohists had also argued that\nwhen a 辯 biàndistinction was\nformulated as a shì-fēi, e.g., one of the\ndisputants calls it “ox” and the other\n“not-ox”, one of them must 勝\nshèngwin i.e., 當\ndānghit on it.  \nThe Later Mohists’ version of common-sense realism incorporated social\nconventions. Conventions set out what\n物 wùnatural-kind each term\n“selects out” or\nbiàndistinguishes from the rest. We then\nextend that distinction to pick out new objects based on their\nobjective similarity or difference (those accessible to “eyes\nand ears” of ordinary people). This is the basis of a social\nstandard of correct word use enshrined in past practice. Hui Shi,\nhowever, had undermined that simple version of realism with his observation that\nbetween any two 物 wùnatural-kinds we\ncan find some similarity and some difference. The\nworld, in effect, gives us many ways of establishing conventional\ndistinctions and assigning names. The Later Mohists had failed to find\nan adequate account of what similarities would and would not lead to\nwhat they called 狂舉 kuāngjǔwild\npicking out . Zhuangzi’s analogy of language to the noises\nmade by wind had seemed to echo Hui Shi’s normlessness about\nlanguage. In this later passage, however, he revisits the wind\nanalogy, and retreats, accepting the Mohist insight that language is\nmore than a “natural sound.” This frustrating vagueness and signature indecision in the text\nleaves interpreters to philosophize about what Zhuangzi’s\nimplicit answer (明 míngdiscern:clear) might\nbe. However, the analogy with bird calls is a fortuitous suggestion.\nWe arrange, adapt and modulate the elements of our language to fit our\nenvironment, abilities, and opportunities (e.g., mating). Would\nZhuangzi have guessed the same about birds? The claim following that\nconcurs that the “aboutness” of a language exists but\naboutness is not fixed. This can be explicated with the\n above discussion of the indexicals 是\nshìthis:right and 彼\nbǐthat. Zhuangzi carries the diectic\ncharacter over to his treatment of the ubiquitous\nshì-fēithis-not that that undergird\nthe norms guiding how to use names (words). We endorse and recommend\n(shì this:right) our guiding terms,\nlanguage and linked behavior. We may base that on our correctly\nfollowing prior commitments to dàos of word\nuse—relying on a Confucian traditional standard, the past and\nexisting practices of our linguistic community.  In one passage, Zhuangzi allows this appeal to past or existing\ncommon practice but does not endorse it as right—merely as\nuseful. Conventions are useful because they facilitate\ncommunication. He he adds a tone of “that is all” hinting\nwe need not regard them as plausible candidates for being absolutely\nright—a single transcendent standard of use.  Zhuangzi describes our past shìs of this kind as\n“like an oath or treaty.” (Ibid., HY 3/2/11) They\nhave “enactment force” committing us to a\ndào governing their later use. We may conform to\n(correctly follow) and further construct our transmitted linguistic\ndào in expressing or performing (為\nwéideeming) other things as\nshì-fēi. Our trajectory along our paths\nincorporates these accumulated commitments to prior practices of\nlanguage use. As our dàos now bring us to new\nsituations, how do we know to project the correct indexed choice from\nthe prior history of differently-indexed behavior? That actual language behavior commits us to a linguistic dào-type, but it’s not clear what the commitment entails at this choice point.  The\nMohists and Confucians are both claiming, from their different\ndirectional perspectives, to be following similar commitments to existing\ndàos of practice. \nMozi’s recommending naturally or empirically available\ndàos for reforming shared linguistic practice was\nitself, Mozi thought, following existing natural practice. He even\nnoticed that our ongoing linguistic practice rejects treating\nsomething’s merely being a shared past practice as automatically making\nit right.  Our existing evaluation practices remind us that shared and\nunquestioned past practices can be wrong.  \nMozi appealed to what he would also have regarded as a purely natural\npractice. Practical efficiency (lì\nbenefit) is a standard accessible to all ordinary people’s\n“eyes and ears.” Each time we apply some natural, empirically guided interpretation in practice, we participate in\nshaping evolving normative practices (both linguistic and behavioral\npractices). Each such decision commits us and others to a\ndào of interpreting our social dào. We\nunderstand our commitment to that dào as a commitment\nto practice and transmit it correctly—where the standard of\n‘correct’ is itself either enshrined in a past practice or\nin natural utility. This is the basis for Zhuangzi’s claim that\nsocial dàos, including linguistic\ndàos, are natural dàos—and there\nare many of them. Further, as the Laozi would later famously\nobserve, dàos can be interpretively guided. They are\nchangeable dàos.    Humans, in finding ways to walk and walking them, initiate the\nconstruction of social paths, naturally and perhaps unintentionally,\nby leaving prints in the natural world. Zhuangzi links the path\nmetaphor to a society’s linguistic practice thus: This sense of the immense complexity and the fluid nature of\nnormative commitments to a dàopath underlie\nZhuangzi’s skeptical\nthemes. 明 Míngclear:discerning seems\nlinked to the gestalt in which we accept ourselves as embedded, along\nwith others similarly situated, in nature’s endlessly complex\nevolution of guiding structures. How do we know either that our past\npractice was correct or that we are correctly following them in this\nnew situation, here and now, based solely on our eyes and ears? Zhuangzi’s stance toward Mohist formal realism (if we\ndisagree on a shì-fēi, one party must 勝\nshèngwin) becomes clearer now. The Mohists\ndid not specify any objective mechanism of “winning”\nbeyond some vague suggestion of tipping a balance. However Zhuangzi’s\npoint in response appears to track the warning function of a\nnorm of truth (even when justified by our best available judging\nstandards, we may still be wrong). Zhuangzi takes\nshèngwinning as a vague primitive in\narguing that we cannot finally settle skeptical doubts by appeal to\nwinning disputes. The main mechanism Zhuangzi discusses is appeal to a\njudge or authority. We appreciate that all judges will also use terms\nlike shì-fēithis-not that indexed by\ntheir acquired commitment momentum. Their judgments, like ours,\nexpress their momentum along a dào of using\nthese words here, now and projecting the usage to\nthat, there, then.  \nIt is not clear if the conclusion is supposed to be a solution to the\nskeptical problem posed or merely a way to cope constructively with\ncomplexity and uncertainty. The passage rules out any appeal to a\nspecial authority of any other point of view—while giving equal\nauthority in the construction to all. Even where we all share some\n“conventional wisdom” it does not have special\nauthority—say over other creatures. This, was  implicit in Mozi’s rejection of socially agreed\ndàos. Zhuangzi’s notorious toying with the perspectives of\nanimals expanded it (for naturalists).\n. Gap-tooth asked\nKingsley, “Do you know that which all natural kinds agree in\nshìendorse-ing?” He answers\n“How would I know that?” “Then, do you know of\nwhat you don’t know?” “And how could I know\nthat?” “So, does no natural kind know\nanything?” “And how would I know that? Nonetheless,\nlet me try to put it in language. How would I know that what I call\n‘knowing’ is not not-knowing? And what I call\n‘not-knowing’, is knowing.” \nAnd let me try a question on you. If people sleep in the damp, they\nget pains and paralysis; would eels? If in a tree, they tremble in\nfear; would monkeys? Of the three, does any know the correct place to\nlive? … From where I see it, the origins of goodness and\nmorality, painting things as ‘this/right’ or\n‘not-that/wrong’ are, as boundaries, both confused and\ncomplicated; how could I know how to distinguish them?\n(Ibid., HY 6/2/64–70) \nThis passage reinforces the conclusion that norms of correct word use\nis Zhuangzi’s core skeptical target. So we may indeed know how\nto act, according to some norms of using ‘know how’ and\nnot if judged by some other dào of correct usage of\nthe knowing/ignorant distinction. Linguistic skepticism easily\nmetastasizes to virtually any commitment. According to which\ndào of projecting past practice should we\njudge this linguistic behavior as conforming to our commitment or\nnot. Normative skepticism, in a use-theory is hard to\ncontain—especially when the model of all judgments is as some indexed\n是 非 shì-fēithis-not that\nassignment. It sweeps in metaphysics, epistemics, and semantics. \nA consequence is that Zhuangzi’s skepticism is broad but weak. Broad\nbecause it infects so many judgments, but weak not merely in the usual\nsense of denying absolute certainty, but in failing to imply that we\nshould stop or refuse to make the judgment. It does not rest on any\ntheory of the probability of an error, but that the concept of an\nerror is subject to the same concerns as the original judgment. It\nneither undermines nor give us reason to withdraw our\njudgments. Appreciating that others reach their views as naturally as\nwe do only removes our status to claim that our judgment is\nauthentically and uniquely correct.  Temporally, Zhuangzi’s\nskepticism is buttressed by reminding us of our own past experiences\nof learning, of acquiring new gestalts, of realizing that what we had\nconsidered the way, was subject to reconsideration and\nimprovement. The skepticism does not target any specific failure in my\nepistemic process. It does not advise me to abandon my present\ncourse. It reminds me only to remain open to the further possibility\nof learning more—about what? About the world? We can do that by\nlearning more about other natural ways of processing and how they work\nin the world—other dàos.  It counts as\nskepticism because it reminds us that we normally err on the side of\noverestimating than underestimating our epistemic security. We think\nwe know and do not more often than we think we don’t know and we\ndo. And that is because we underestimate the range of possible\nalternative dàos. Hence the pragmatic upshot of his\nskepticism is to remind us to engage with more other points of\nview. \nZhuangzi’s skepticism is weak because it acknowledges that we\nmay apply different concepts of ‘knowing’ in different\nsituations. Implicitly, it does not deny that we could meet\nsome particular standard of knowing, but that we could know\nfor every situation which standard is the right one. What standard is\nthe right one to use for acknowledging or denying someone knows well\nenough to satisfy, for example, the correct dào of\nassertion?  \nThis feature of Zhuangzi’s skepticism lies at the heart of the famous\ndebate between Zhuangzi and Hui Shi about the fish-pleasure in which\nZhuangzi defends a claim to know against Hui Shi’s\nchallenge. Zhuangzi makes an assertion and Hui Shi initiates the\nskeptical challenge. His challenge implies that there is a favored or\ncorrect standard of knowing that turns out to be impossibly\nstrict. All knowledge must come from inside. It’s impossibly strict\nbecause it doesn’t allow Hui Shi to issue the challenge in this\nconversation.  \n  Graham drew our attention to the role of perspective in this\npassage, noting that Hui Shi’s challenge to Zhuangzi’s assertion\ndoes not use the normal question form, (何\nhéhow do you know?) but a locative question word\n(安 ānwhence?). This brings the debate into\nalignment with Zhuangzi’s concern about the various perspectives\nfrom which to deploy a dào of word use. Here, as\n above, the word is 知\nzhīknow. The norm of asserting, as in\nEnglish, involves answering the challenge “how do you\nknow?” What normative conditions allow me, here and now,\ncorrectly to use the term zhīknow—hence\nto make the assertion about these fish below me? Hui Shi both knew\nZhuangzi was relying on a dào of using\n‘know’ “from zhuangzi‘s here” and\nHui Shi knew Zhuangzi’s situation from his own relevantly\nsimilar “here-now” and relying on the same 道\ndàonorm of claiming to know from a distinct\nperspective. Hui Shi cannot consistently insist that a speaker can\nonly use 知 zhīknow when he\noccupies the perspective of the thing known. Notice, the argument about the fish implies we have a perspective\non the perspectives of others. So skepticism grounded in dependence or\nrelativity of perspective need not be predominantly\nnegative. Zhuangzi, here, uses it to justify a way of claiming to\nknowing. In many other parables, he addresses the kind of knowing that\ncomes with a gestalt shift, especially when we see our own and\nothers’ points of view as similar—see ourselves as others\nsee us. This is the more comprehensive perspective Zhuangzi urges on\nus. We experience such gestalt shifts especially when we come\nappreciate we had been wrong before and now view things\ndifferently. We are confident from our own “now” that we\nhave made epistemic progress—our new awareness seems\n“relatively” improved to us now. We reach a state where we\njudge our former perspective to be inferior to our present one. It\nincludes insight into our relative situations. Evidently, this\nawareness of one’s own perspective as one of many, equally\nnatural points of view motivates us to wonder if we have made the\nfinal correction. This enhanced awareness of ourselves as one of many\nperspectives is an intelligible candidate reading of Zhuangzi’s\n明 míngclarity. It is harder to\nconstruct a coherent narrative for mystical and/or dogmatic\nreadings—those that jump from an improved perspective to a\nperfect one.  This kind of gestalt shift leads us to reflect on how narrow our\npast perspective had been. It features prominently in the “Autumn\nFloods” Chapter 17. The Earl of the Yellow River, having thought\nhimself as the ultimate, discovers the North Sea and announces his\nformer error and newfound awareness of his lesser significance in\n“the greater path.” The North Sea Overlord tells him that\nhe too sees himself as situated in a modest status in a still greater\nscheme and rejects the River Earl’s attempts to identify the\nNorth Sea’s as ultimate. He casts doubt on there being a final,\nultimately small or large. \nCan we describe Zhuangzi’s míng as “having\na sense of our limited perspective?” Credulous, dogmatic and\nimperious absolutists do not appreciate themselves as being in one of\na variety of natural perspectives. Broad open-mindedness and mild\nskepticism come together in the míngclarity\nZhuangzi encourages in us. It has a dual nature—an epistemically\nmodest perspective on ourselves that arises from improving our\nepistemic status and encourages us to continue. It helps us appreciate\nthat we are still as naturally situated and others with whom we may\ndisagree and still grow. Further improvement can come from further\nexchange of perspectives.  \nThe naïve Confucian-Mohist advocates of imposing a single social\ndào thus disrupt the natural process by which social\ndàos evolve in real time as we seek a harmony guided\nby “glances at nature.” Seeing things from another’s\nperspective both alerts us to how we could be wrong and makes us feel\nthat we now understand things better than with our former, narrower\nperspective. Yet, the Zhuangzi repeatedly reminds us not to\nabandon epistemic modesty when we make epistemic progress. That we now\nsee things from a perspective in common with another does not make us\nboth right. Yet, the more comprehensive our perspective, the\n“clearer” the new gestalt should seem.   The search for this kind of perspective on ourselves and others\nseems to motivate Zhuangzi’s willingness to engage and interact\nwith others, seeking to understand their perspective as having a\nnatural status and role for them as ours does for us. This is partly\nillustrated by common sense examples of our judging from our own\ncurrent perspective that theirs “adds something” enriching\nour own perspective by our own lights. Sometimes it’s dangerous\nto try to mix others’ perspectives with your own.   Aside from its frequent usefulness from our point of view, the\nmain benefit from the self-recognition as a natural creature embedded\nas are others at a perspective-point within a natural network\nstructure is to encourage being open-minded.  Part of the value is the\nhumbling of our epistemic pride, mildly disrupting our judgment\nequilibrium. Without such an occasional perspective on ourselves, we\ntoo easily fall into exaggerating our epistemic exceptionalism. The\nreminder that we are intermingled with others in a web of natural\nperspectives gives us an appropriate, realistic correction.  A\nZhuangzi story illustrates such a moment. Zhuangzi was wandering in Diaoling fields when he glimpsed a\n  weird magpie-like-thing flying in from the south. It had a wingspan of\n  over seven-feet and passed so close his forehead, he could feel\n  it. Then it gathered its wings and settled in a chestnut\n  grove. Zhuangzi thought “what bird is that?  Massive\n  wings of such power and eyes so large it couldn’t see\n  me.” He hiked up his robe and hurriedly tiptoed closer holding his\n  cross-bow at the ready. Then he spotted a cicada settling in the\n  shaded shelter without a worry for itself, but a preying mantis\n  opened its pincers about to grab it, also focused on its gain and\n  ignoring its own bodily danger. The strange magpie burst out and\n  harvested them both—similarly unaware of the natural dangers he\n  faced. \nBut Zhuangzi was suddenly seized with this thought, “We natural\nkinds are all interconnected! We two different species are mutually\nseeing things in our own ways.” He dismantled his crossbow and\nfled, himself now himself pursued by the game warden shouting out his\ncrimes. (Ibid., HY 54/20/61–5) Overall, Zhuangzi clearly recommends open-minded flexibility as\nwhen he scolds Hui Shi for being tied to conventional thinking about\nhow to use giant gourds. He illustrates it again with his story about\ndifferent uses of a salve that prevents chapping. He models such\nopenness in his conversations with cripples (righteously shunned by\nConfucians), freaks, thieves, strange creatures, the wind, a shadow\nand a skull. He imagines many other conversations illustrating the\ndifferences of perspectives, capacities and needs.  \nWhile we cannot help making our own judgments and commitments, he\nseems to see tolerance and accommodation as values that follow from\nappreciating other natural perspectives:  We are, as it happens, capable of understanding the perspectives\nof others well enough to accommodate and cooperate with them, to\nborrow insights and to reach agreements. However, the\nZhuangzi seems skeptical that we can extrapolate from this\nordinary capacity to broaden our perspective to having some absolute\nor comprehensive insight—as it were from all points of\nview. Nor, as we saw above, can we assume that because the two\ndisputants come to a resolution or agreement, it constitutes knowing\nfrom a cosmically or absolutely higher perspective.  Hui Shi’s\nrelativism, recall, does point to such an infinite expansion ending in\na single universal point of view. Here, however, we are reminded that\nwhile we experience a gestalt broadening of perspective as revealing\nsomething real and significant (like waking from a dream), we cannot\nextrapolate from that to the claim to be able to know the final result\nof such gestalt leaps to broader perspectives. \nEven though North Sea Lord denies there is any final or ultimately\nbroad perspective from which we can make\nshì-fēithis-not that judgments, the\nparable suggests a progressive path toward broader perspectives with\nthose further along having the epistemic status to guide those with\nless comprehensive perspectives. However, arguments in Chapter 2\nsuggest that progress must always be judged from a moving frame of\nreference along a dào that is already\nchéngfixed in our\nxīnheart-mind that shoots-out the\nshì-fēi. Our location and trajectory makes us\nreceptive to some and not other avenues of learning. The boy was\nunable to master the Handan way of walking\nbecause of the way he had already learned to walk. The monkey keeper\ncould accommodate the monkeys, but still disagreed with them about the\nimportance of the breakfast-dinner choice. That someone understands\nand agrees with both of us does not make his judgment correct. The\nfinal skepticism concerns whether these paths of progress of\nperspectives must or will converge on a single outcome.  \nThe epistemic modesty implicit in Zhuangzi’s skepticism targets\nmainly the paternalistic, superior attitude toward other points of\nview exemplified by Confucian and Mohist moralistic posture. When we\nhave an accommodation (you and I come to a common agreement) you and I\nmay both rate it as progress. However, it does not imply we have moved\nto a higher state of overall insight along an absolute scale—or from\nany arbitrary third point of view. Exchange of points of view can be\nvaluable to each (perhaps in different ways) and broadening\nperspective in this way can make us wiser—but always as judged\nfrom our already operative 成\nchéngfixeddàos . We can\nadvise and recommend our normative perspective on others, but their\nbeing able to appreciate and use it depends on their capacities,\noptions and situation.  \nAt this point, Zhuangzi starts to draw an analogy of dreaming and\nwaking up to the shift in gestalt that comes when we leap to a more\ncomprehensive perspective. At awakening, we immediately appreciate the\nunreality of the dream, yet within the dream, we can have a similar\ngestalt shift and dream of having dreamed and interpreted that deeper\ndream.  So, is there an ultimate or final possible such shift in\ngestalt—some final state of knowing what to do? Zhuangzi’s\nrelativism is mildly skeptical because he cannot know either that\nthere is not nor that there is a final or ultimate\n“awakening” \nThe dream theme is memorably carried over to the story of Zhuangzi\ndreaming a butterfly and/or vice versa. It seems to suggest that the\ngestalt sense of liberation from error may even be reciprocal. Perhaps\nour subsequent perspective is one from which most would move to our\nformer perspective. Adolescent conversion can be to or from a\nreligion.   Elaborating the complexity this way makes Zhuangzi’s\nproposals seem disappointing as solutions. They amount to mildly\nsuggesting that we allow the exchange of views to go on without the\ndomination of any dogma and with some vague “glances at natural\nconstancies” and see what comes out “in the long\nrun.” \nZhuangzi’s conception of dàos in nature, from a\nhere-now to a there-then, differs from a Mohist (broadly utilitarian)\nnaturalism. Utilitarianism is a natural constraint, an allegedly\nsingle naturally correct way for all of us to choose our course. In\neffect, Zhuangzi is more of a natural pluralist, with the natural\noutcome of morality the product of ongoing individual and social\nconstruction. Dàos are in nature but not choices of\nnature for us. So the discussion, competition, and even strife between\ndàos and their advocates are factors in an ongoing\nnatural 道 dàoguiding process. We and\nour circumstances change as we each find, choose and walk different\nnaturally evolving paths. \nThis does not entail we should not advocate our own way. Such\nexchanges are part of the natural process of construction of 道\ndàospaths and making them available to\nothers. Such a dialogue of competing dàos constitutes\nthe natural evolutional dào of guidance. Realizing\nthis, we should not flatter ourselves, posing as the Confucian father\nshaping his child’s character, but as a contributor in this\ncompetition among similarly natural ways. We express perspectives\nlocated in a real world of indexed points from which we choose\nbehavioral paths. Some characters in Zhuangzi’s dialogues wonder\nabout exceptional figures who allegedly have abilities that justify\nthat paternal posture—the capacity to transcend our location in\npoints of view and to lecture all of us from a privileged\nperspective. The Zhuangzi’s response typically remind\nthem that such idealized points of view are neither intelligible to us\nnor relevant to what we should do. Either these exceptional\nobservers have their own naturally\nchéngfixed frames of reference in the\nnatural world, or they are outside of the natural world in some\nunrealistically free realm. If the latter, then their views are both\nunintelligible and irrelevant to us. What they would do in our\nsituation does not constitute helpful advice to us. To advocate\nfollowing the advice of these ideal observers is to speak practical\nnonsense to non-ideal, actual actors. \nGap Tooth, following Kingsley’s skeptical formulation\n above says: So you don’t know what is beneficial or harmful, does the\n“fully arrived human” necessarily not know them? \nKingsley replied, “the fully arrived person becomes pure\nsapience, he could be in a blazing forest and not be able to feel any\nheat, the rivers of our civilization could freeze and he\ncouldn’t feel any chill, devastating lighting could pulverize\nmountains and the wind raise a tidal wave and he could not experience\nsurprise. Someone like that could ride on clouds and air, straddle the\nsun and moon, and wander beyond the four oceans.  Death and life\nare not different for him, much less the inclinations of benefit and\nharm.”\n Master Ju Que asked master Zhang Wu, “I’ve heard from\nmy teacher that a sagely man does not find social dealings worth\nengaging, doesn’t pursue utility, doesn’t avoid harm,\ndoesn’t take delight in striving, doesn’t follow\ndàos, in silence says things, and in saying things is\nsilent, and roams outside the nitty-gritty of the actual world. Master\nregarded this as romantic fantasy but I deem it the execution of a\nmysterious dào. My kind sir what do you say of\nthis?” \nZhang Wu replied, “This is something that, were the yellow\nemperor to hear, it would be like buzzing, and so how could the likes\nof Confucius come to know it? Furthermore, you have jumped to\nconclusions… . I’ll give you some absurd talk and you absurdly\nlisten.” (Ibid., HY 6/2/71–7)  However, in later chapters, Zhuangzi himself seems to recommend to\nus examples of such spectacular capacities—the most beautifully\nand elaborately expressed of which is the passage celebrating Butcher\nDing. Butcher Ding carved an ox for Lord Wen Hui; his point\nof contact, the way he inclined his torso, his foot position, the\nangle of his knee … gliding, flowing! The knife sang\n“whuaa” with nothing out of tune. It was as if he were\ndancing the Faun Ballet or directing an opera.  Lord Wen Hui exclaimed “Ole! Splendidly done! Can talent\nextend even to this?. \nButcher Ding gestured with his knife, explaining,  “What your\nservant pursues is dào; which is what skill aims\nat. When I began to carve oxen, what I saw was nothing but the\noxen. After three years, I had ceased seeing them as wholes, and now\nmy sapience mingles so that I don’t see with my eyes, Sensory\nknow-how ends and my sapient desires take over my performance. I rely\non natural guiding structures, separate out the great chunks and steer\nthrough empty gaps depending on the anatomy. I evade places where\ncords and filaments intertwine, much less the large bones.  A good cook gets a new knife every year; he chops! Mediocre cooks\nchange knives monthly; they hack. My knife now has 19 years on it;\nit’s carved several thousand oxen and the edge is as if I had\njust taken it from the sharpener. \n  Those joints have gaps, and the knife’s edge no thickness, to\nput something infinitesimally thin in an empty space?! Effortless! It\neven allows the edge wander in with ample room to play. That is why,\nwith 19 years on it, this knife’s edge is grindstone\nfresh.”  The Zhuangzi plays several variations on this theme.\nSometimes the virtuoso performer catches cicadas on a sticky rod,\nanother crafts chariot wheels, there are musicians, debaters, and\nthieves. The theme extends to animals, millipedes with their expertise\nin coordinating their limbs while maintaining a smooth flow, snakes\nflashing by while slithering on their stomachs, One implicit example\nis Zhuangzi’s own relation with his relativist rival and buddy,\nHui Shi. Bemoaning his loss while visiting his sidekick’s grave,\nZhuangzi spins a tale of a virtuoso ax-thrower who sliced specks off\nthe nose of his crony, but lost his “knack” when his\nco-performer passed away. (Ibid., HY 66/24/48–51)  The tales often highlight the tranquil state that accompanies\nbehavior that skillfully follows a natural path. The performances look\nand feel effortless. The spontaneity of the flow along a natural path\ngives performers the sense that their behavior is\n“world-guided” rather than internally controlled.  These\nbehaviors become second-nature. We move beyond anything like\nsub-vocalizing instructions, deliberating or reflecting—and yet we\nare concentrating intently on the behavior. The range of his examples\nreminds us that such satisfying states of performance can be\nexperienced in even the most low caste and mundane of activities,\nincluding butchering, criminal skills, as well as in the finest of\narts, and philosophy.  \nAnother feature of this theme is the observation that such expertise\nin performance always comes with some kind of limitation—not\nleast that each example is a different person with a different\nknack. There is no shortcut dào that gives you a knack\nat every activity. Cook Ding “comes to a hard place;” the\ncicada catcher tries to balance two coins on his stick—if he is\nnot calm enough, he will have a bad night. The wheelwright could not\nteach his son the art; the musician cannot play all the notes and only\nreaches true perfection when he dwells in silence. And above all, the\nvalorization of this kind of specialization in an art pulls in the\nopposite direction of Zhuangzi’s encouragement to broaden and\nenlarge our perspectives and scope of appreciation.  \nThis theme of the limits of virtuosity is pursued explicitly in the Zhuangzi’s\ndiscussion of the necessary connection of\n成 chéngcompletion:success and\n虧 kuī failure:deficiency. The theme of\nthis weak skeptical relativism plays out smoothly into the classical\nChinese focus on paths as the model of normativity and the objects of\nknowledge. Paths are everywhere, but guide natural kinds from particular space-time\nlocations and can guide a wide range of behavior types, normative\nsubject matters. Each leads to subsequent choices among\ndàospaths. Zhuangzi does not ground his\nskepticism in an account of specifically human epistemic\ndeficiencies. We are one among many natural creatures with different\ncapacities choosing paths from their indexed point in space and time.\nThe skeptical theme is the wide range of our different\nperspectives. We are limited mainly in the sense that there is no\nbehavior from the point of view of the whole—there is no omniscient\nperspective on the path structure. We may wonder if we have discovered\nall the available 道 dàospaths. And\nwe may always wonder if our judgment about which is best now is about\nthe best in the long run. All we can substitute for this global\nperspective is some local consensus. \nThe weak skeptical conclusion is most strikingly expressed in the\nobservation that introduces the chapter with the story of Cook\nDing.
