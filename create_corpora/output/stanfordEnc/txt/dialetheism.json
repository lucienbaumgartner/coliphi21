Such a sentence is, or has, what is called a truth value glut, in distinction to a gap, a sentence that is neither true nor false. (We shall talk of sentences throughout this entry; but one could run the definition in terms of propositions, statements, or whatever one takes as one’s favourite\ntruth-bearer: this would make little difference in the context.)\n\n\n\nDialetheism is the view that there are dialetheias. If we\ndefine a contradiction as a couple of sentences, one of which is the\nnegation of the other, or as a conjunction of such sentences, then dialetheism amounts to the claim that there are true\ncontradictions. As such, dialetheism opposes—contradicts—the Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC), sometimes also called the Law of\nContradiction. The Law can be expressed in various ways; fixing the precise formulation is itself a topic of debate (Priest et al 2004, Part II). Thomas Reid put the LNC\nin the form ‘No proposition is both true and false’. \nA strong (modal) statement of the LNC is: for any \\(A\\), \nit is impossible that both \\(A\\) and\n\\(\\neg A\\) be true. \n\n\n\nIn Book \\(\\Gamma\\) of the Metaphysics, Aristotle introduced\n(what was later to be called) the LNC as “the most certain of all\nprinciples” (1005b24)—firmissimum omnium\nprincipiorum, as the Medieval theologians said. Since Aristotle, there have been few sustained attempts to defend the law. The LNC has been an (often unstated) assumption, felt to be so fundamental to rationality that some claim it cannot be defended, e.g. David Lewis 1999.\nAs a challenge to the LNC, therefore, dialetheism assails what most philosophers take to be unassailable common sense, calling into question the rules for what can be called into question (cf. Woods 2003, 2005; Dutilh Novaes 2008). \n\n\n\n\n\nSince the advent of\nparaconsistent logic in the second half of the twentieth century,\ndialetheism has been developed as a view in philosophical logic, with precise formal language. \nDialetheism has been most famously advanced as a response to logical paradoxes, in tandem with a paraconsistent logic. The view has been gaining, if not acceptance, the respect of other parties in the debate; one critic writes that dialetheists have shown,\n\n\nas clearly as anything like this can be shown, that it is coherent to maintain that some sentences can be true and false at the same time. … [A]nd that perhaps is a radical conclusion, and a major advance in our understanding of the issues (Parsons 1990).\n\n\n\n\nIn this article, 1) we will start by explaining the connection between\ndialetheism and other important related concepts, such as the ones of\ntrivialism and paraconsistency. Next, we will describe 2) the history\nof dialetheism and 3) the motivations for contemporary dialetheism, \namong which the logical (semantic and set-theoretic)\nparadoxes figure prominently, though not exclusively. We will then 4)\nindicate and discuss some of the objections to dialetheism, and 5) its\nconnections with the notion of rationality. Finally, 6) we will point\nat some possible themes for further inquiry concerning the connections\nbetween dialetheism, realism and antirealism in metaphysics.\n\nThe word ‘dialetheism’ was coined\nby Graham Priest and Richard Routley (later Sylvan) in 1981 (Priest et al 1989, p. xx). The inspiration for\nthe name was a passage in Wittgenstein’s Remarks on the Foundations\nof Mathematics, concerning Russell’s paradox (see also below): \nA dialetheia is a two-way truth, facing both truth and falsity like a Janus-headed figure.\nUnfortunately, Priest and Routley forgot to agree how to spell the\n‘ism’, and versions with and without the ‘e’\nappear in print.  \nIn philosophy, there tends not to be a distinction between a view being inconsistent and being incoherent. Both are unacceptable. Since dialetheism claims that some inconsistency can be maintained without incoherence, these two concepts must be disentangled. For a start, dialetheism should be distinguished from so-called trivialism, that claim that all sentences are true, and hence all contradictions are true too (Kabay 2010). Dialetheism is the view that some contradictions are true. \nA trivialist must be a dialetheist, since a trivialist accepts every claim.\nBut since ‘some’ does not imply ‘all’, the converse is not the case: a\ndialetheist typically claims that only some (and, usually, very specific)\nsentences are dialetheias, not that all of them are. Trivialism is by all accounts incoherent, and so is minimally what counts as unacceptable even for someone who thinks that some contradictions are true. \nHow to allow inconsistency without incoherence is one of the main\ntopics of dialetheim. A standard\nsolution consists in subscribing to the view that deductive logical consequence is\n paraconsistent.  A\nlogical consequence relation \\(\\vdash\\) is explosive if,\naccording to it, a contradiction entails everything (ex\ncontradictione quodlibet: for all \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): \n\\(A,\\neg A \\vdash B\\)).  It is paraconsistent if and only if (iff) it is not\nexplosive. By adopting a paraconsistent logic, a dialetheist can\ncountenance some contradictions without being thereby committed to\ncountenancing everything and, in particular, all contradictions.  The\ndevelopment of paraconsistent logics has contributed to the most\nrecent developments (and acceptance of the legitimacy) of\ndialetheism. \n\nDialetheism should, however, be clearly distinguished from\nparaconsistency. Whereas dialetheists must embrace some paraconsistent logic or other to avoid\ntrivialism, paraconsistent logicians need not be dialetheists: they\nmay subscribe to a non-explosive view of entailment for other reasons.\nWithin paraconsistency, one may distinguish (at least) four grades of paraconsistent involvement (Beall and Restall 2006, p.80):\n \nMost people working on paraconsistent logics have commitments at the lower grades of the spectrum. The unifying thought behind\nparaconsistency is gentle-strength: logical consequence should not validate arbitrary conclusions following indiscriminately from inconsistent premises. This may simply be because entailment must preserve more than just truth, e.g., information content, topicality, or some meaningful connection between premises and conclusion. Or it may be that a paraconsistent logician simply need not assume anything about truth in order to provide a working treatment of inconsistency as it may arise in databases, legal situations, works of fiction, theory change, belief-revision, etc. \n \nStepping up, full-strength paraconsistentists treat inconsistent models, in which contradictions hold, as useful mathematical tools without committing to them as representing real possibilities. \n \nAnd stepping up again, industrial-strength paraconsistentists may hold that, though truth at the actual world is consistent, still entailment must preserve what holds in peculiar non-actual situations, some of which may be inconsistent (see Berto, 2007a, Ch. 5, and Priest, Beall and Armour-Garb, 2004, p. 6). The first three levels appear to be independent of dialetheism. (But for reason to worry that there is a ‘slippery slope’ from gentle to dialetheic paraconsistency, see Priest 2000. For particular worries about model theory, see Asmus 2012, and in the modal case, Martin 2015.)\n \nAt the top of the spectrum, dialethiec paraconsistency holds that some contradictions are, in some sense, true in the actual world.\nEven among full-fledged dialetheists, differences remain, for example,\nin what is meant by “true”, e.g., on whether they subscribe to a \n deflationary theory of truth, \na correspondence view, a view in which true contradictions are merely semantic, or something else. \nWe will come back to this point in section 6 below. \n\n\nWe said at the outset that dialetheism challenges the LNC. Now this claim needs some qualification, since forms of the \nLNC are, in fact, accepted as a general logical law in dialetheism, at least in versions based in e.g. the paraconsistent logic LP. \nDialetheism as set out by Priest takes all instances of the schema \\(\\neg(A \\wedge \\neg A)\\) to be true, as well as taking as true some sentences that are inconsistent with it, namely, true sentences whose negations are true: dialetheias. According to such versions of dialetheism, all contradictions are false and some are true: dialetheism is itself a dialetheia (‘Concluding self-referential postscript’ to Priest 1979, p. 203).\n \n\nMuch of the ongoing discussion about dialetheism involves not just the LNC but its dual, the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM). (See section 3.2 below.) The LEM says (informally) that for every sentence \\(A\\), either \\(A\\) or \\(\\neg A\\) is true (we bracket here views that disentangle the LEM from Bivalence). \nDialetheism is the thesis that there are truth value gluts, challenging the LNC; the dual position, challenging the LEM, is that there are truth value gaps. It is a subtle issue, which we will not discuss\nhere, whether a gap should count as lacking any \ntruth value, or as having a non-classical value distinct from both truth and\nfalsity, and similarly whether a glut has two truth values, or some third ‘glutty’ value. In any case, these dual approaches are nowadays labelled\nparacomplete versus (paraconsistent) dialetheic theories of truth.\n(The paraconsistent/paracomplete terminology is not entirely happy: see Ripley 2015a, footnote 1; but is now standard.)\nPriest’s logic includes the LEM and he rejects the existence of gaps in Priest 1987/2006, ch.1. Other approaches are both paracomplete and paraconsistent; they include a place for both gaps and gluts. The case for and against dialetheism turns as much on the status of the LEM as the LNC; see Beall and Ripley 2018. While the word ‘dialetheism’ is relatively new, the idea is not. In this section we note some points in the history of philosophy where true contradictions appear salient, either explicitly or implicitly. (Much of this scholarship is due originally to Priest and Routley 1983, and Priest 1995/2002.) Then we address methodological issues to do with historical interpretation, and give a quick sketch of more recent history. Aristotle takes a number of the Presocratics to endorse dialetheism, and with\napparent justification. For example, in Fragment 49a, Heraclitus says:\n“We step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and we are\nnot” (Robinson, 1987, p. 35). Protagorean relativism may be\nexpressed by the view that man is the measure of all things; but according\nto Aristotle, since “Many men hold beliefs in which they\nconflict with one another”, it follows that “the same\nthing must be and not be” (1009a10–12). The Presocratic\nviews triggered Aristotle’s attack in Metaphysics, Book\n\\(\\Gamma\\). Chapter 4 of this Book contains Aristotle’s defence of the\nLNC. As we said above, historically Aristotle was almost completely\nsuccessful: the LNC has been orthodoxy in Western Philosophy ever\nsince. \nAs an aside, and as mentioned above, there is an often-remarked upon duality between truth-value gaps and truth-value gluts (Parsons 1990). And yet, \nit is perhaps worth noting that in Metaphysics \\(\\Gamma\\)\n(Chapter 7) Aristotle also defends the dual of the LNC, the Law of\nExcluded Middle, LEM, particularly in the version which has nowadays\nbeen distinguished as the Law of Bivalence: for any \\(A\\), it is\nnecessary for (at least) one of \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) to be\ntrue. But the LEM has often had a less secure place in Western\nPhilosophy than the LNC, in spite of the numerous obvious dualities\nbetween the two principles. Aristotle himself, at least according to one interpretation, appears to\nattack the Law in De Interpretatione, Chapter 9, when he\ncomes to the famous subject of future contingents. \n\nDespite the orthodoxy about the LNC since Aristotle, during the Middle Ages the problem\nof seemingly true contradictions surfaced in connection to the\nparadoxes of divine omnipotence—for instance: can God make\na stone too heavy for Him to lift? (See Cotnoir forthcoming.) We find St. Pier Damiani getting close to dialetheism in the De divina omnipotentia, by\nblaming St. Girolamus for having claimed that God cannot overturn the\npast and twist what happened into something that didn’t happen. Since\nGod lives an eternal present, denying Him power over the past equates\nto denying Him power over current and future events, which is\nblasphemous. So God must have the power of making what is done\nundone. Later on, Nicholas of Cusa placed at the core of his\nbook De docta ignorantia the idea that God is\ncoincidentia oppositorum: as a truly infinite being, He\nincludes all opposite and incompatible properties, therefore being\nall things, and none of them: God has all properties, including\ncontradictory ones (Heron, 1954, I.4). \n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant argues that some contradictions, the antinomies of pure reason (concerning time, space, and other categories), are produced by an illicit use of pure concepts; nevertheless, he also holds such an illicit use\nto be a “natural and inevitable illusion” (Kant, 1781, p.\n300)—a side effect of reason’s pursuit of completeness in\nknowledge. \nReasoning about the world as a whole, a totality which is never given to us as such, can lead us to apparently dialetheic conclusions: e.g. that it has a beginning in time and a limit in\nspace, and that it has no beginning nor limits in space, that it is\ninfinite in space and time. Both horns assume the opposite thesis and\nseemingly perform a reductio. (In Kantian terms, the “transcendental\nillusion” begins when we turn what should just be a regulative\nideal into a limit-object.) According to Kant, at least in\none way of resolving the antinomies, the fallacy lies in treating the\nworld as a whole as an object—in mistaking a subjective\n“condition”, as Kant says, for an objective reality. \n\nNow, according to Hegel such a conception has something to be said for\nit as well as against it. Kant has a point in showing, via the\nantinomies, that dialectics is “a necessary function of\nreason”, and in defending “the necessity of the\ncontradiction which belongs to the nature of thought\ndeterminations” (Hegel, 1831, p. 56). However, Kant takes from this only the familiar result that reason is incapable of knowing the Absolute,\nthat is, actual reality. A dialetheic interpretation holds that, on the contrary, we should abandon such\n“tenderness for the things of this world”, and the idea\nthat “the stain of contradiction ought not to be in the essence\nof what is in the world; it has to belong only to thinking\nreason” (Hegel, 1830, p. 92). On a dialetheic interpretation, contrary to what Kant held, the\nKantian antinomies are not a\nreductio of the illusions of reason; they are perfectly sound\narguments, deducing the dialetheic nature of the world. (For a\nreconstruction of this Kantian-Hegelian debate, see Part II of Priest\n2002.) \n\nIn non-Western traditions, there are more overt examples of what appears to be dialetheic thought. \nIn ancient Indian logic/metaphysics, there were standardly four possibilities to be\nconsidered on any statement at issue: that it is true (only), false\n(only), neither true nor false, or both true and false. \nSome logicians added a fifth possibility: none of these. Both\npositions were, arguably, called catushkoti (Priest 2002, ch.16; Deguchi et al 2008; Tillemans 2009.) The Jains went even\nfurther and advocated the possibility of contradictory values of the\nkind: true (only) and both true and false (see Smart 1964). \n \nContradictory utterances are a commonplace in Daoism, perhaps most famously in Laozi (Lao-Tsu): on one translation, \na statement which appears to be speaking about the true Way. The Zhuangzi says: “That which makes things has no boundaries with\nthings, but for things to have boundaries is what we mean by saying\n‘the boundaries between things’. The boundaryless boundary is the\nboundary without a boundary” (Mair, 1994, p. 218). When Buddhism and\nDaoism fused to form Chan (or Zen, to give it its Japanese name), a\nphilosophy arose in which contradiction plays a central role. The very\nprocess for reaching enlightenment (Prajna) is a process, according to\nSuzuki (1969, p. 55), “which is at once above and in the process of\nreasoning. This is a contradiction, formally considered, but in truth,\nthis contradiction is itself made possible because of Prajna.” \nRecent discussions of dialetheism have centered on Buddhist thought in particular, where some interpreters argue that texts invoke outright contradictions. For example, in the Mahayana tradition, Nagarjuna presents many passages similar in form to: \nOn a dialetheic interpretation, advocated by Priest, Garfield, and Deguchi (see Priest 2002 ch.16, Deguchi et al 2008), readers should take Nagarjuna and others in the Madhyamaka school at their word—not as invoking some sort of mysticism, but as affirming the nature of reality. This is most salient in Nagarjuna’s doctrine of emptiness (sunyata), that all things are empty or lacking independent existence (svabhava). Since all things are empty, it follows that emptiness is empty too; or, more prosaically, “The ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth” (Siderits 2007, p.182; Priest 2002, p.260). These utterances, if true, would appear to be self-contradictory, and therefore dialetheias.  \nFor work on dialetheism in Buddhism, see the collections Garfield et al 2009 and Tanaka et al 2015. For discussion as to whether dialetheism is the appropriate way to interpret Buddhist texts, see the papers in Tanaka 2013. For more general difficulties see the entry on comparative philosophy: Chinese and Western. \n\nInterpreting the philosophers we have mentioned is a\nsensitive issue. \n\nMany commentators have suggested that the seemingly contradictory\nutterances of the philosophers in question are not really\ncontradictory. There are a number of standard devices that may be\nemployed to block a dialetheic interpretation. One is to question, in the case of non-English sources, whether the apparently contradictory translation is correct. Another is to claim that the contradictory utterance is to\nbe taken as having some non-literal form of meaning, e.g., that it is\na metaphor, or a way of pointing towards some higher, ineffable truth. \nAnother is to claim that the contradictory assertion is\nambiguous in some way, and that it is true on one disambiguation or respect, false in another. \nThis last technique is\ncalled parameterisation: when\none is confronted with a seemingly true contradiction, \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\), treat the suspected\ndialetheia \\(A\\), or some of its parts, as having different\nmeanings, and hence as ambiguous (maybe just contextually\nambiguous). For instance, if one claims that \\(P(a) \\wedge \\neg P(a)\\), parameterisation holds that one is\nin effect claiming that \\(P_1 (a) \\wedge \\neg P_2 (a)\\) (e.g. elephants are big and not big, because they are big in the context of land animals on Earth, but not big in the context of stars and planets). In the\nMetaphysics, Aristotle hints that a critic of the LNC\nis playing with the equivocal meanings of some words: “for to each definition there might be assigned a different\nword” (1006b 1–2). \n\nNo one would dispute that contradictory utterances are sometimes best construed parametrically. (Again, dialetheists do not claim that all contradictory statements are true.) The question is whether parameterisation is the best approach\nin the case of the philosophers we have mentioned; answering this in a dialetheic context is a matter for\ndetailed case-by-case consideration. A defender of the dialetheic interpretation would say that consistent parameterisation produces an inaccurate and\ndistorted version of the views of the philosopher in question. In any\ncase, even if parameterisation is always possible, this does not impact arguments for or against the LNC. An a priori claim that contradictions\ncan always be avoided by parameterisation does not show, without begging the question, the correctness of such interpretations: sometimes parameterisation may be the best thing to do,\nbut independent justification should be given on each occasion. \n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, with the rapid development of paraconsistent logics, came the modern form of dialetheism. \nIn 1966, Asenjo published a short note, “A Calculus of Antinomies”, based on his 1954 PhD dissertation; the opening line reads \nHere, having two truth values would mean being both true and false, a glut, or what Asenjo calls (following Kant) an antinomy. Asenjo simply seems to assume without further ado that there are antinomies, and in Asenjo and Tamburino 1975 asserts that they are “useful logical entities”, especially for dealing with paradoxes in mathematical contexts. Born in Buenos Aires, Asenjo came to the University of Pittsburg in 1963 as a professor in the mathematics faculty, where he was in contact with logicians such as Belnap, Anderson, their student Dunn (who thanks Asenjo in his 1966 PhD thesis, that also toys with true contradictions), and nearby, Meyer. By the mid-1970s, Richard Routley (Sylvan), in collaboration with Meyer, was developing a ‘dialectical’ position that rebukes what they call “the consistency hypothesis” and accepts some statements as both true and false (Routley and Meyer 1976; Routley 1977, 1979). In 1979, Priest’s paper “The Logic of Paradox”, developed eventually into the book In Contradiction (1987/2006), presented what are now the most famous arguments for dialetheism. In the collaboration between Priest and Routley, the contemporary dialetheic program was launched. Much of Priest and Routley’s early joint work is summarised in Priest et al 1989 (also available as Priest and Routley 1983). More recent developments are canvassed below.\n \nProbably the master argument used by modern\ndialetheists invokes the logical\n paradoxes of self-reference.\nIt is customary to distinguish between two families of such\nparadoxes: semantic and set-theoretic. The former family typically\ninvolves such concepts as truth, denotation,\ndefinability, etc; the latter, such notions as\nmembership, cardinality, etc. After Gödel’s and\nTarski’s well known formal procedures to obtain non-contextual\nself-reference in formalized languages, it is difficult to draw a sharp\nline between the two families, among other things, because of the fact\nthat Tarskian semantics is itself framed in set-theoretic terms.\nNevertheless, the distinction is commonly accepted within the relevant\nliterature. \n\nRussell’s paradox is \nthe most famous of the set-theoretic paradoxes; it arises when\none considers the set of all non self-membered sets, the Russell set. Cantor’s paradox arises in connection with the universal set. The most famous of the semantic paradoxes is the \nLiar paradox. \nAlthough cases for the existence of dialetheias\ncan be made from almost any paradox of self-reference, we will focus\nonly on the Liar, given that it is the most easily understandable and\nits exposition requires no particular technicalities. \n\nIn its standard version, the Liar paradox arises by reasoning on the\nfollowing sentence: \n(1): (1) is false\n \nwhere the number to the left is the name of the sentence to the right.\nAs we can see, (1) refers to itself and tells us something about (1)\nitself. Its truth value? Let us reason by cases. Suppose (1) is true:\nthen what it says is the case, so it is false. Then, suppose (1) is\nfalse: this is what it claims to be, so it is true. If we accept the\naforementioned Law of Bivalence, that is, the principle according to\nwhich all sentences are either true or false, both alternatives lead to\na contradiction: (1) is both true and false, that is, a dialetheia,\ncontrary to the LNC. \n\nThe paradox can also be produced without any direct self-reference,\nbut via a short-circuit of sentences. For instance, here is a looped\nLiar: \n(2a): (2b) is true \n(2b): (2a) is false \n\nIf what (2a) says is true, then (2b) is\ntrue. However, (2b) says that (2a) is false …. And so on: we\nare in a paradoxical loop. This is as old as Buridan (his Sophism no. 9: Plato saying ‘What Socrates says is true’; Socrates replying ‘ What Plato says is false’).\n \n\nParadoxes of this kind have been known since antiquity (the standard Liar is attributed to the Greek philosopher Eubulides,\nprobably the greatest paradox-producer of antiquity). But they were\nthrown into prominence by developments in the foundations of\nmathematics around the turn of the twentieth century. In the case of\neach paradox, there appears to be a perfectly sound argument ending in\na contradiction. If the arguments are sound, then dialetheism is true.\nOf course, many have argued that the soundness of such arguments is\nmerely an appearance, and that subtle fallacies may be diagnosed in\nthem. Such suggestions were made in ancient and medieval logic; but\nmany more have been made in modern logic—indeed, attacking the\nparadoxes has been something of a leitmotiv of modern logic.\nAnd one thing that appears to have come out of this is how resilient\nthe paradoxes are: attempts to solve them often simply succeed in\nrelocating the paradoxes elsewhere, as so called\n‘strengthened’ forms of the arguments show. Let us have a\nlook. \n\nA radical solution, which never won big consensus but has been revitalised in recent times (Pleitz 2018), has it that there just cannot be meaningful self-rererential sentences. Various works (notably Martin 1967, van Fraassen 1968, Kripke\n1975, Field 2008) have proposed to solve the Liar paradox by\ndismissing Bivalence, whereby some sentences are\nneither true nor false, and the Liar is one such truth value\n‘gap’.\nTruth value gaps, and the\ninclusion of the Liar among them, are differently motivated in the\nvarious approaches. But the common core thought is the following: even though\nthe Liar is a sentence such that, if it were true, it would be false,\nand vice versa, no explicit contradiction according to which\nit is both true and false need follow. We can avoid the contradiction\nby rejecting the idea that truth and falsity are the only two options\nfor a sentence: the Liar is neither. For a comparative survey of the two kinds of approach, see Beall and\nRipley 2018. \n\nThese approaches face difficulties with the so-called\n‘strengthened’ Liars—sentences such as the\nfollowing: \n(3): (3) is not true. \n(4): (4) is false or neither true nor false. \n\nNow these sentences should be, on the gappy theorist’s non-bivalent approach,\neither true, or false, or neither. But, for instance, if (3) is true,\nthen things are as it claims they are; therefore, (3) is not true\n(either false or truth-valueless). If (3) is false, or neither true\nnor false, in both cases it is not true; but this is precisely what it\nclaims to be; therefore, it is true. We seem to have to conclude that\n(3) is both true and not true, contrary to the LNC. A similar line of\nreasoning goes for (4). \n\nAccording to Priest the strengthened Liars show that a single feature\nof the semantic paradox underlies its different formulations. The\ntotality of sentences is divided into two subsets: the true ones, and\ntheir ‘bona fide complement’—call it\nthe Rest. Now the essence of the liar is “a particular\ntwisted construction which forces a sentence, if it is in the bona\nfide truths, to be in the Rest (too); conversely, if it is in the\nRest, it is in the bona fide truths” (Priest 1987, p. 23). The\nstandard Liar, ‘This sentence is false’, is just a\nparticular instance of this, producing a contradiction within the\nbivalent framework, in which the Rest is identified with the set of\nthe false sentences. We can try to resolve the problem by\nadmitting sentences that are neither true nor false, so that the false\nones become a proper subset of the Rest. However, the strengthened\nLiars show that we can use the notions introduced to solve the\nprevious paradox to re-describe the Rest. Once the set of sentences is partitioned into a trichotomy\n(true, false, and neither true nor false), the disjunctive\n‘This sentence is false or neither true nor false’ embraces the whole Rest, i.e. the new(ly described) complement\nof the set of the true sentences. What about adding more values? If there is some fourth thing that a sentence can be, besides true, false, and neither true nor false, we can always take\nthe notion\nfourth thing and produce another strengthened Liar: \n(5): (5) is false, or neither true nor false, or the fourth thing.\n \nSee Kirkham 1992, pp. 293–4.\nThese strengthened liars are also called revenge liars, and the general phenomenon we have just witnessed has become known as revenge; see Beall 2007, e.g. the introduction, and Cook 2007, among other essays.   There is no generally agreed upon solution to the semantic paradoxes. One typical way out attempted by the supporters of truth value gaps, for instance, consists in\ndenying that the notion of gap, or defective\nsentence, or sentence whose truth value is\nindeterminate, can be fully expressed in the language for which\nthey are proposing their theory of truth. The strengthened paradoxes\nthen seem to force the consistent theorist to admit that the proposed\ntheory was formulated in a language different from, and expressively\nmore powerful than, the one whose semantics it was supposed to\nexpress. This entails a limitation of the Tarskian T-schema\ncharacterising truth, i.e., of the\nequivalence \nwhere\n‘\\(Tr\\)’ is the truth predicate for the relevant\nlanguage, and \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) is the appropriate name of\nsentence \\(A\\). This approach makes a rigid distinction between an\nobject language and its metalanguage. Such a distinction was\nintroduced by Tarski to expel the Liar paradox from formalized\nlanguages—but Tarski himself insisted that his solution is inapplicable to natural languages, which do not appear to depend upon some\nmetalanguage for their semantics. As Kripke admits at the end\nof Outline of a Theory of Truth, “the ghost of the\nTarski hierarchy is still with us” (scil. the paracompletists:\nsee Kripke 1975, p. 80). Tarski, in short, identified the cause of the semantic paradoxes to be semantic closure—the fact that natural languages such as English satisfy the T-schema. Tarski took this to mean that there can be no consistent formalization of a semantically complete language, only a approximation thereof stratified into metalanguages. Dialetheists agree, but draw the conclusion in the other direction: the appropriate formalization of a language such as ours, because it is semantically closed and is not hierarchically stratified, will be inconsistent (Priest 1987, ch.1, Beall 2009, ch.1). \n\nThese two features—a claimed immunity to revenge/strengthened liars, and dispensing with the object-language/metalanguage distinction—are argued to give dialetheism about the paradoxes of self-reference some of its major appeal. As Shapiro (in a critical note) puts it, dialetheists offer that we \nThe simplicity of a dialetheic theory of truth, then, is claimed as an additional further feature. The\ntwo most prominent such theories to date are presented in Priest\n1987, and Beall 2009. In the former, the truth predicate \\(Tr\\)\nfor the relevant formal language, modelling the behaviour of truth in\nEnglish, is simply characterized by the unrestricted T-schema, \\(Tr\\langle A\\rangle \\leftrightarrow A\\), which,\nas stressed by many philosophers, is an overwhelmingly \nintuitive—perhaps even analytic—principle\nconcerning truth. It is admitted that some sentences—notably,\nthe Liars—are truth value gluts, that is, both true and false\n(the construction may also sustain sentences which are both true and\nnot true, although not all dialetheias need be of this kind); and no\nhierarchy of metalanguages or further epicycles are needed. \n\nBeall’s 2009 theory allows a fully transparent truth predicate: one such that\nfor any sentence \\(A\\), \\(Tr\\langle A\\rangle\\)\nand \\(A\\) can be replaced with each other in all (non-opaque)\ncontexts salva veritate, that is, producing sentences\nlogically equivalent to the sentences one started with. Then the\nunrestricted T-schema follows from transparency (and the fact\nthat \\(A \\rightarrow A\\) is a logical truth) as a special\ncase. In Beall’s theory, all sentences \\(A\\) that are\ndialetheias are not only true and false, i.e. (given that falsity is\ntruth of negation), \\(Tr\\langle A\\rangle \\wedge Tr\\langle \\neg A\\rangle\\); they are also true and\nuntrue, \\(Tr\\langle A\\rangle \\wedge \\neg Tr\\langle A\\rangle\\): this again follows from the\ntransparency of truth. Beall’s theory is based on a (relevant) paraconsistent logic,\nwhose modal semantics employs so-called\n non-normal worlds. \n \n\nOverall, such paradoxes as the Liar provide some evidence for the\ndialetheist’s claim that some contradictions are provably\ntrue, in the sense that they are entailed by plain facts concerning\nnatural language and our thought processes. Extended Liar paradoxes\nlike ‘This sentence is not true’ are spelt in ordinary\nEnglish. Their paradoxical characteristics, dialetheists argue,\nare due exactly to the intuitive features of ordinary language:\nunavoidable self-reference; the failure of metalinguistic hierarchies,\nwhich only produce languages that are expressively weaker than English;\nand the obvious presence of a truth predicate for English, ‘is\ntrue’, which is characterized, at least extensionally, by either the Tarskian T-schema or rules amounting to the transparency of truth. For a sustained critical engagement with paraconsistent dialetheism as a solution to the semantic paradoxes, see Field 2008, part 5 (chapters 23–26). \nIn the larger family of paradoxes of self-reference beyond the semantic, \ndialetheism affords a treatment of the set-theoretic paradoxes. These paradoxes arise in set theories based on an unrestricted ‘comprehension\nschema’ for sets: for any condition or property, including\nparadoxical ones like non-self-membership, there exists a\ncorresponding set. In particular, inconsistent sets like Russell’s are admitted; analogously to the Liar, the Russell set\nis and is not a member of itself. As with the truth schema, the set comprehension principle seems very natural and intuitive, and such\ncontradictions do not give rise to triviality due to the\nparaconsistent logic underlying the formal theories. Though the\nissue is too technical to be addressed here, and more appropriately\ndealt with in the entries on\n paraconsistent logic\nand \n inconsistent mathematics, \nthe reader can consult Routley 1979, Brady 1989, for inconsistent set theories, and Weber 2012 for recent results in the field. See also Mortensen 1995. For different approaches to dialetheic set theory, see Restall 1992 and Ripley 2015b. \nSince dialetheism appears to resolve both the semantic and set theoretic paradoxes at once and in the same sort of way (namely, accept the contradictory outcomes as true), this has been presented as another major strong point for dialetheism. Priest argues that the paradoxes share an underlying structure (which he calls the Inclosure Schema in Priest 2002). This is used in tandem with what Priest dubs the principle of uniform solution (“same kind of paradox, same kind of solution”) to urge that, since all the set theoretic and semantic paradoxes are of a kind, then dialetheism presents a uniquely unified solution. \n \nA point of dispute about the dialetheic approach to the paradoxes of self-reference concerns the Curry paradox. \nThis is produced by a self-referential sentence claiming ‘If I\nam true, then \\(\\bot\\)’, where \\(\\bot\\) is a constant (what\nlogicians usually call the falsum) which is or entails\nsomething that is also dialetheically unacceptable, say \\(\\bot =\\)\n‘Everything is true’, the incoherent trivialist claim. \nPrima\nfacie, this does not involve negation, nor a falsity\npredicate. However, many logicians think that Curry’s paradox is very similar to the Liar, and therefore by the principle of uniform solution that it should be handled in the same way. A dialetheist, though, cannot simply accept that the Curry sentence is both true and false, because if it is true then \\(\\bot\\) follows. Dialetheists need a different treatment of Curry. A standard dialetheic strategy to deal with the\nCurry paradox has consisted in exploiting paraconsistent logics with a\n‘noncontractive’ conditional (see again Priest 1987, Ch,\n6, Beall 2009, Ch. 2), \nwhich do not validate the Contraction (or Absorption) Law, i.e., the rule:\nfrom \\(A \\rightarrow(A \\rightarrow B)\\) infer \\(A \\rightarrow B\\), or the so-called pseudo-modus ponens\nprinciple \\((A \\wedge(A \\rightarrow B)) \\rightarrow B\\). \n Stronger forms of the paradox, though, validity curry, seem to show that dropping these principles is not enough (Beall and Murzi\n2013). This leads to contraction-free logics within the broader\nfamily of substructural logics (Restall 2000, Priest 2015), and indeed substructural dialetheic approaches that drop principles other than contraction, such as transitivity (Ripley 2012).\nCurry’s paradox puts pressure on the dialetheic story about uniform solution to the paradoxes. Beall (2014a, 2014b) urges this point; Weber et al 2014 is a reply.\n \n\nDialetheias produced by the paradoxes of self-reference are confined to the abstract realm of notions such as set or to semantic concepts such as truth. However, the paradoxes of self-reference\nare not the only examples of dialetheias that have been mooted. Other\ncases involve contradictions affecting concrete objects and the\nempirical world, and include the following. \n\n(1) Transition states: when I exit the room, I am inside the\nroom at one time, and outside of it at another. Given the continuity\nof motion, there must be a precise instant in time, call it \\(t\\), at\nwhich I leave the room. Am I inside the room or outside at time \\(t\\)?\nFour answers are available: (a) I am inside; (b) I am outside; (c) I\nam both; and (d) I am neither. There is a strong intuition that (a)\nand (b) are ruled out by symmetry considerations: choosing either\nwould be completely arbitrary. (This intuition is not at all unique to\ndialetheists: see the article on boundaries\nin general.) As for (d): if I am neither inside not outside the room,\nthen I am not inside and not-not inside; therefore, I am either inside\nand not inside (option (c)), or not inside and not-not inside (which\nfollows from option (d)); in both cases, a dialetheic situation. Or so\nit has been argued. For a recent description of inconsistent\nboundaries using formal mereology, see Weber and Cotnoir 2015. \n\n(2) Some of Zeno’s paradoxes concerning a \nparticular—though, perhaps, the most basic—kind of transition,\nthat is, local motion: a moving arrow is both where it is,\nand where it is not. In any given instant, argues Zeno, it cannot move to where it is, since it is already there, and it cannot move to somewhere else, because there isn’t time for it to get there. The orthodox way out of the paradoxical situation,\nas formulated, e.g., by Russell 1903, has it that motion is the mere\noccupation of different places at different times. But one could argue that this\nis denial of the phenomenon itself, that is, of the actuality of motion:\nRussell’s solution entails that motion is not an intrinsic state of the\n(allegedly) moving thing, for, at each instant, the arrow is not moving\nat all. Can a going-somewhere be composed by an (even\ncontinuum-sized) infinity of going-nowheres? An alternative,\ndialetheic account of motion, which takes at face value the\naforementioned Hegelian idea that “Something moves, not because at one\nmoment it is here and another there, but because at one and the same\nmoment it is here and not here, because in this ‘here’, it at once is\nand is not”, is exposed in Priest 1987, Ch. 12. \n\n(3) Borderline cases of vague predicates. Popular approaches to\nvagueness and the \n sorites paradox, such as the ones based on many-valued logics, or\nsupervaluations, require some under-determinacy of reference, and/or\nthe rejection of Bivalence: if an adolescent, \\(m\\), is a\nborderline case of adultness, \\(A\\), then \\(A(m)\\)\nmay turn out to have an intermediate truth value between truth and\nfalsity, or no truth value at all. But it may be conjectured that a\nborderline object like \\(m\\), instead of satisfying neither a\nvague predicate nor its negation, satisfies them both: an adolescent\nboth is and is not an adult. Given the obvious dualities between the\nLEM and the Law of Bivalence on the one side, and (respectively,\nsyntactic and semantic formulations of) the LNC on the other, it is\nnot too difficult to envisage a ‘sub-valuational’ semantic\napproach, dual to the supervaluation strategy. Sub-valuational\nparaconsistent semantics have been proposed by Hyde (1997), and Varzi\n(1997). Other ‘glutty’ approaches to vagueness have\nbeen proposed by Colyvan (2009), Weber (2010), Priest (2010),\nRipley (2013), and Cobreros et al (2010, 2015), motivated on both theoretical and empirical grounds. \n\nIf inconsistencies due to vague predicates and borderline objects are taken to be \ndue to merely semantic under- and over-\ndetermination of ordinary language (de dicto), then this is further evidence for dialetheism about semantics. If the aforementioned phenomena are taken to be not just about words but things (de re), then actually inconsistent objects are admitted, together with vague objects. And this spreads\ninconsistency all over the empirical world: if borderline cases can be\ninconsistent, inconsistent objects are more or less everywhere, given\nhow pervasive the phenomenon of vagueness notoriously is: adolescents,\nborderline bald men, etc. Inconsistency is observable (Beall and Colyvan 2001). Beall argues against the approach in Ch. 5 of Beall 2009, and Beall 2014a. \n\n(4) Multi-criterial predicates. We may assume that the\nsemantics of a predicate is specified by means of its criteria of\napplication. Now ordinary language hosts predicates with different, and\noccasionally conflicting, criteria of application (e.g., ‘left wing’): some criteria for\napplying a predicate \\(P\\) (e.g., caring about social welfare, raising minimum wages) may entail that object \\(m\\) (e.g., a political party) is in the\nextension of the predicate, some others (promoting nationalism, oppressing immigrants), that \\(m\\) is in its\nanti-extension, or negative extension. Criteria can in some cases be\nencoded by such things as meaning postulates (or other similar, albeit\nmore sophisticated, semantic devices); but conflicting meaning\npostulates may be embedded in our standard linguistic practices, and\ndifficult to detect and identify. If the extensions of our ordinary\npredicates are constrained by our intuitions, and such intuitions turn\nout to be inconsistent, a good semantic account of the situation may\nwell have to reflect this fact (accepting, in our example, that a party counts as both left and right wing), instead of destroying it by means of\nsome regimentation (e.g. via the usual parameterisation, or distinction\nof respects). As Priest 1987, pp 67–9, clarifies, it is also hard to analyse such situations as cases of vagueness (so that a party has to be understood as being left wing to some degree, and right wing to some degree). \n\n(5) Certain legal situations, such as inconsistent bodies of\nlaw. Suppose, for instance, that some norm states that a marriage\nperformed by the captain of a ship counts as a legal marriage only if\nthe ship was in open water throughout the ceremony. It turns out,\nthen, that some other law has established that such a marriage is\nvalid also if the ceremony has only begun with the ship in open water,\nbut has ended with the ship in the port. Then someone may turn out to\nbe both a married man and not a married man. (Since it does not appear to follow that he is not a man anymore, or both a man and not a man, we have another putative counterexample\nto ex contradictione quodlibet). If one accepts the plausible\nview that statements concerning legal rights, obligations, and\nstatuses, can be truth-value apt, we seem to have a dialetheia. Of\ncourse, legal systems sometimes have mechanisms that can be used to\nremove such inconsistencies (e.g., by ordering different kinds of laws\nin a hierarchy from customary laws, to established jurisprudence, to\nordinary legislation, to constitutional norms, etc.; or via\nthe lex posterior principle, giving priority to the more\nrecent norm in case of conflict). But this is not always the case: the\ninconsistent laws may be of the same rank, enacted at the same time,\netc. For a recent discussion, see Beall 2016. \n\nEach of the above arguments undoubtedly calls for further\ndevelopment. Priest 1987 includes detailed discussions of all of them. Ficara 2014 includes recent work. \n\nWe now turn to arguments against dialetheism. The most prominent sustained\ndefence of the LNC in the history of philosophy is, as mentioned, that given by Aristotle in Chapter 4 of Metaphysics,\n\\(\\Gamma\\). A critical analysis of Aristotle’s arguments is given point-for-point by Priest (1998b/2006 ch.1), who finds them to often conflate dialetheism with trivialism (that\nis, conflating the claim that some contradictions are true, and\nthe one that all contradictions are). We will look at some more modern arguments against dialetheism. \n\nA standard argument against dialetheism is to invoke the\nlogical principle of Explosion, in virtue of which dialetheism would\nentail trivialism. Granted that trivialism is absurd (though see Priest 2000a,\nPriest 2006, Ch. 3, and Kabay 2010), dialetheism must be\nrejected. Since this argument assumes that explosion is logically valid, it will carry no weight against a dialetheic paraconsistentist. \n\nInterestingly enough, while Aristotle’s defence of the LNC\nmay slide between attacking dialetheism and trivialism, Aristotelian syllogistic —\nthe first formally articulated logic in Western philosophy—is\nnot explosive. Aristotle held that some syllogisms with inconsistent\npremises are valid, whereas others are not (An. Pr. 64a 15). Just\nconsider the inference: \n(P1) Some logicians are intuitionists; \n(P2) No intuitionist is a logician; \n(C) Therefore, all logicians are logicians. \n\nThis is not a valid syllogism, despite the fact that its premises\nare inconsistent. The principle of Explosion had a certain tenure at\nplaces and times in Medieval logic, but it became well-established\nmainly with the Fregean and post-Fregean development of what is now called classical\nlogic. For the logical aspects of denying explosion, see the article on paraconsistent logic. \nThere are several objections to dialetheism involving the notion\nof exclusion. The very rough idea is that dialetheists have\nlet in more truths than non-dialetheists, but subsequently now\nhave trouble keeping enough falisity out.  This objection, in\none form or another, has been a recurring theme in criticisms of\ndialetheism.\n \nA version of the argument from exclusion against dialetheism found, for instance, in McTaggart 1922 (see Berto\n2006, 2012) is as follows. A sentence is meaningful only if it rules\nsomething out. But if the LNC fails, \\(A\\) does not rule out\n\\(\\neg A\\), or, a fortiori, anything else. Hence\nmeaningful language presupposes the LNC. \n\nThere are problems one may find with this argument. One is that\neven though a dialetheia does not rule out its negation, it still may\nrule out several other things. A bigger trouble is that the\nfirst premise looks to be simply false. Consider again the sentence\n‘Everything is true’. This entails everything, and so\nrules out nothing. Yet it is meaningful. It is something that\neveryone, except a trivialist, rejects. \n\nOne might attempt a more sophisticated explanation of the notion of\nruling out, for instance in terms of information theory, or\nperhaps possible worlds. One may claim that a statement ‘rules\nout’ something insofar as there are situations, or worlds, at\nwhich it fails. In this sense, ‘Everything is true’ does\nrule something out. But now, it is this account of propositional\nmeaning which can be challenged in general. If mathematical truths have a\nstrictly necessary status (which may safely be assumed here), Fermat’s\nLast Theorem rules out nothing: being a necessary truth, it holds at\nall possible worlds. But it is perfectly meaningful; people wondered whether it was true or false for centuries; and its proof by\nAndrew Wiles was a substantial discovery.  \nOne argument from exclusion, \nwith a more ad hominem twist, claims that the dialetheist has trouble with expressing disagreement with rival positions in debates (see Parsons 1990, Shapiro 2004, Littman and\nSimmons 2004). For when the\ndialetheist utters ‘\\(\\neg A\\)’, this is in itself\ninsufficient to rule out that \\(A\\) is the case, given that, in a\ndialetheic world, it may well be that both \\(A\\) and\n\\(\\neg A\\). Similarly, ‘\\(A\\) is false’ and even\n‘\\(A\\) is not true’ might not do the trick, since for\nthe dialetheist some \\(A\\)’s being false, or untrue, does not\nrule out its being true. As Parsons puts it, \nElaborations and repetitions of this line of thought have come to be\nknown in the literature as the ‘just true’ or ‘true\nonly’ problem, e.g. Rossberg 2013. (Young 2015, however, argues\nthat the exclusion problem is distinct from the just-true problem.)\n \n\nTo this, the dialetheist has various replies. Priest has argued that\nthe logical operation of negation should be distinguished from the\nspeech acts of denial and the cognitive state of rejection. So, contra\nFrege, assertion of a negation is not the same as denial. The idea is\nthat exclusion is expressed via a primitive notion\nof rejection: to reject \\(A\\) is to positively refuse to\nbelieve that \\(A\\). That the notion is taken as primitive means, in\nparticular, that it is not reducible to the acceptance of negation: it\nis a sui generis act. The linguistic counterpart of rejection\nis the speech act of denial. Then the dialetheist can rule out that\n\\(A\\) is the case by denying \\(A\\); and this does not amount to the\nassertion of \\(\\neg A\\) (Priest 2006, Ch. 6).  More simply, one can\noften express denials by uttering ordinary language negations:\n‘not’ is, in this sense, pragmatically\nambiguous. We will come back below to how, and why, rejection-denial\nmay not be reducible to the acceptance-assertion of any negation. \nAnother way in which the dialetheist may express the\nexclusion that \\(A\\) is the case is by uttering ‘\\(A \\rightarrow \\bot\\)’, where again \\(\\bot\\) is \n‘Everything is true’. \nSimilarly, a dialetheist may try to fix that \\(A\\) is consistent by saying\n‘if \\(A\\) is both true and false, then \\(\\bot\\)’.\nConsiderations by e.g. Field (2008, Ch. 27), Murzi and Carrara (2013), and Berto (2014), however, cast doubt on whether ‘arrow-falsum’ can work as a dialetheic exclusion-expressing device in all cases. One reason is due to side-effects of the\naforementioned Curry paradox. Another is that ‘arrow-falsum’ is very strong; a mundane sentence like ‘Alice had spaghetti for dinner’ may be false-only (she didn’t), but if it were true too, that wouldn’t be absurd.\nCf. Beall 2013, proposing exclusion via non-logical, theory-specific rules of the form \\(A,\\neg A \\vdash \\bot\\) for each sentence \\(A\\) we take to be consistent; Scharp 2018 suggests possible problems for this approach.\n The exclusion problem gets its strength from some background assumptions. Specifically, it seems to presuppose that the content of a proposition is given in terms of splitting all possible situations, or worlds, into those where the proposition holds and those where it does not. Even accepting this presupposition, though, would\nnot affect a dialetheic challenge to the LNC. For a given \\(A\\) to\nbe a dialetheia, putting things in these terms, it is sufficient that\nthere be overlap between the worlds where \\(A\\) holds, and those\nwhere its negation holds. And this is compatible with the idea of\npropositional content as splitting the totality of worlds—but now with overlap.\nThe tenability of such an overlap, though, requires discussing the account of negation from classical logic, to which we now turn. \n\nArguments against dialetheism are often focused on the concept of logical negation. The main one\ngoes as follows. The truth conditions for negation are:\n\\(\\neg A\\) is true iff \\(A\\) is not true. Hence,\nif \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) were true, \\(A\\) would be both true and not true, which is impossible. \n\n\nWhat to make of this argument? First, the truth conditions\nfor negation employed here are contentious. An alternative view has it\nthat \\(\\neg A\\) is true iff \\(A\\) is false, and\n\\(\\neg A\\) is false iff \\(A\\) is true—and in the\nsemantics of many paraconsistent logics (for instance, the logic of\nFirst Degree Entailment), truth and falsity may overlap. Such an\naccount preserves our intuition that negation is the operator which\n(truth-functionally) switches truth and falsity. It also preserves our\nintuition on contradictoriness, in the form: \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare contradictories iff, if \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\) is false,\nand if \\(A\\) is false, \\(B\\) is true. What has to go, on this proposal, is\nthe assumption that truth and falsity are exclusive\nin all cases: there exist dialetheias, that is, sentences falling\nsimultaneously under both categories. \n\nSecondly, a dialetheist can point out that the argument against dialetheism based\non the truth conditions for (classical) negation begs\nthe question at its last step: why should we assume that it is\nimpossible for \\(A\\) to be both true and not true? Well, because\nit is a contradiction. But that is precisely what is at issue; the critic was supposed to be arguing for the\nimpossibility of any contradiction holding to begin with. In fact, the\ndialetheist may even accept a characterisation of the truth\nconditions for negation as: ‘\\(\\neg A\\) is true\niff \\(A\\) is not true’. For if the\n‘metalanguage’ in which the characterisation is expressed\ncan be inconsistent in its turn, as a thoroughgoing dialetheist is\nlikely to allow (as in Weber et al 2016), then there is no guarantee that the ‘not’\nin that clause behaves consistently. \nSo the debate comes back to the basic question of whether or not consistency can be presupposed. \nA variant on the anti-dialetheic argument from negation comes from a\nQuinean conception of logical vocabulary. It goes as follows. Even\ngranting that there is an operator, say, \\(*\\), which behaves as\ndialetheists claim (namely, such that in particular in some\ncases \\(A\\) is true together with \\(*A)\\), it is still\nperfectly possible to define a negation with all the\nproperties of classical negation; in particular, the property of being\nexplosive. And since classical negation is the standard operator in\nlogic, it is misleading to translate anything non-classical as\n‘not’: such a translation risks simply calling\n‘negation’ something different. A change in logical\nvocabulary is a “change of subject”, as the Quinean slogan\ngoes. A version of this objection to dialetheism is due to Slater (1995); see also Restall 1993. \nOne line of reply to the Quinean objection available to the dialetheist is that the objection is confused between a logical theory and what the theory is a theory\nof. There are many different and well-worked out logical theories of\nnegation (minimal negation, intuitionistic negation, De Morgan\nnegation, etc.). Insofar as each one of them characterizes its own\ntheoretical object, there is no rivalry between logics. Rivalry begins\nwhen we wonder whether some account or other captures the meaning and\nfunctioning of negation as it is used in the vernacular. An applied\naccount of negation is a theory of something, and the\ntheoretical object has to fit the real object. Now, to assume\nbeforehand that the classical account of negation is the\ncorrect one, in the sense that it captures how negation works in the\nvernacular, again begs the question against the dialetheist (and,\nindeed, against most non-classical logicians): it is circular\njust to assume that classical negation gets it right. People\nwho propose a treatment of negation alternative to the\nclassical one are not thereby proposing to\nrevise negation, but to revise an account of it, which they consider incorrect. \nIf it is agreed that a fair discussion between dialetheists and non-dialetheists cannot presuppose one account of negation over the other, then this suggests a simpler reply from dialetheists to the just-true/exclusion problems from 4.2 above. The reply now is to demur from the presuppositions of the just-true/exclusion objections. Without begging any questions one way or the other, this reply goes, all agree that for a sentence to be just-true amounts to it being true and not false, and just-false being false and not true. Then as Priest puts it (Priest 1987, p.291 of 2006 edition), \nIn the exclusion objection, it appears that the dialetheist is being\nasked to ensure that the words she utters behave\nconsistently—which is exactly what is at issue. (See Restall\n2010 and the reply in Beall et al 2011 for one round of this sort of\ndiscussion.) A dialetheist goes on to question why one should think\nthat commitment to an explosive logic is, in itself, a guard against\ncontradiction, and therefore why dialetheists are supposed to be in\nspecial difficulty with respect to the exclusion question any more\nthan a non-dialetheist.  Filling in the details here will vary, but\nthe reply, in short, is for a dialetheist as with anyone else,\n‘just-true’ is just ‘true’ (Beall 2009,\np. 54).\n  One final way this same sort of objection is expressed is by\nasking dialetheists for some way to sort the true-only sentences from\nthe true-and-false sentences: \nPriest’s suggestion is that dialetheists are working with truth and falsity, just like non-dialetheists. Accounts of negation differ, but this on its own does not create any special obligations on the part of dialetheists.  \n\nSome have felt that what is wrong with dialetheism is not so much\nviolation of the LNC itself, as that an acceptance of the LNC is a\nprecondition for rationality. For example, it is often suggested that\nit could not possibly be rational to accept a contradiction. \n\nIt is a matter of ongoing debate what the conditions are under which it is rational to\naccept something. Nevertheless, it is commonly agreed that, as Hume\nput it, the wise person “proportions his beliefs to the\nevidence” (1955, p. 118). If this is right, then if a sufficient case can be\nmade out for a contradiction, it will be rational to believe it. And\nsometimes this does seem possible. We have seen that a seemingly\ncompelling argument can be made in favour of the truth of the\nstrengthened Liar sentence, ‘This sentence is not\ntrue’. Whether or not one takes the argument in question to be\ncompletely persuasive, it suggests that there is nothing in principle\nimpossible about the existence of good arguments for true\ncontradictions. Of course, if there were conclusive evidence for the\nLNC, then no case for a contradiction could be strong enough. But\nconclusive evidence for any philosophical position is difficult to\nachieve. \n\nA more persuasive worry about dialetheism, relating to rationality,\nis the claim that if a person could legitimately accept a\ncontradiction, then no one could be forced, rationally, to\nabandon any view held. For if a person accepts \\(A\\) then,\nwhen an argument for \\(\\neg A\\) is put up, they could simply\naccept both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\). \n\nA dialetheist can reply that, again, not all contradictions are equal. Each sentence, including each contradiction, is evaluated on its merits. While a case can \nbe made for the claim that the Liar sentence is both true and false,\nbut this in no way shows that a case can also be made for Brisbane\nbeing and not being in Australia. (Of course, if one subscribes to the\nclaim that entailment is explosive, a case for one contradiction is a\ncase for all; but if entailment is paraconsistent, this argument is of\nno use.) \n \nAs orthodox philosophy of science indicates, there are, in\nfact, many different considerations that speak for or against the\nrational acceptability of a theory or a view. Among the epistemic\nvirtues of a theory are: its adequacy to the data; its simplicity,\ncleanness and elegance; its unity and freedom from ad hoc\nhypotheses; its explanatory and predictive power; etc. Not only do\nthese (and other) criteria come in degrees, but they may also be\northogonal to each other. In the end, the rational evaluation of a\nview must balance it against all criteria of this kind (of which,\nconsistency is, arguably, one), each, on its own, being defeasible.\n \nDialetheism asks us to consider the possibility that a theory lacking the virtue of\nconsistency may still overcomes its rivals in all or most of the other respects.\nAccording to dialetheists, this is actually the case with the\ndialetheic account of the semantics of ordinary language, whose \nadvantages with respect to consistent accounts have already been\nshortly suggested above. And conversely, of course, an inconsistent theory may\nwell be trumped by a consistent theory, all things considered. So it\nmay be rational to reject an inconsistent position, even if it is\nlogically possible that it is true.\nRationality considerations are dealt with at length in Priest 2006.\n \n\nIf some contradictions are true, it is natural to expect that a dialetheist will\nsometimes accept, or believe in, contradictions, and assert them.\nPriest (2006, p. 109) adopts the following Rationality Principle: \n(RP) If you have good evidence for the truth of \\(A\\), you\nought to accept \\(A\\).\n \n\nBelief, acceptance, and assertion have a point: when we\nbelieve and assert, what we aim at is believing and asserting what is\nthe case or, equivalently, the truth. Therefore, the dialetheist will\naccept and, sometimes, assert both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\), if\nshe has evidence that \\(A\\) is a dialetheia. \n\nNotice that this need not entail that the dialetheist both accepts\nand rejects \\(A\\) at the same time. We now come\nback to the issue flagged in Section 4.2, on the irreducibility of\nrejection to negation. That rejecting\n\\(A\\) is tantamount to accepting its negation is a common view,\nfamously endorsed and defended (more precisely in terms of the\ncorresponding speech acts of assertion and denial) by Frege and Peter\nGeach. But dialetheists have argued that this fusion is a confusion (see\nBerto 2008 on this issue). The point can be made independently of the\nissue of dialetheism: a paracompletist may well want to deny \\(A\\), but it would be unfair to\ntake such a denial as equivalent to the assertion of \\(\\neg A\\), since\nif \\(A\\) is truth-valueless, \\(\\neg A\\) is normally\nconsidered truth-valueless, too, not a truth, and so not to be asserted. A dual position can hold for\ndialetheism: given that accepting \\(\\neg A\\) is different from\nrejecting \\(A\\), a dialetheist can do the former and not the\nlatter—exactly when she thinks that \\(A\\) is a\ndialetheia. \nDoes this show that dialetheism is compatible with rationality? The story about assertion and denial, acceptance and rejection has been challenged from several directions. We will just mention a few. \n \nRestall (2015) argues that the the acceptance/rejection issue makes gappy and glutty approaches symmterical: gap theorists cannot assert some true claims about paradoxes, but glut theorists cannot reject some false claims about non-paradoxes; see also Restall 2013, Jenny 2017.\nIn a note by Laura Goodship (1996), she suggests that the proposal of separating denial from assertion of negation runs into problems related, again, to Curry’s paradox. Her proposal is, in effect, that it would be more natural for dialetheists to both accept and reject things after all.\nFocusing on the phenomenon of disagreement in natural language, Ripley (2015a) argues that dialetheists (and paracompleteists) should rejoin classical logicians in taking negation to embed denial, and denial to express disagreement. Ripley proposes that dialetheists simply admit that (1) agreement and disagreement are incompatible (“it’s incoherent to do both”, p. 306), but (2) in some cases, assert and deny the same thing. The result would be what Ripley calls paracoherentism, which (in echo of paraconsistency) would try to allow local incoherence without global incoherence. How this could be done is an open question. Ripley suggests dropping the transitivity of logical consequence. Goodship herself ultimately recommends dropping modus ponens, a proposal that has been dubbed the ‘Goodship project’ (Beall 2015, Omori 2016, Priest 2017).\n \nThere certainly are various other arguments against dialetheism in the\nphilosophical market (see papers in Priest et al. 2004). For example, Zalta (2004, p. 432) argues that preserving “our pretheoretic understanding of what it is to exemplify or instantiate a property” requires us to preserve the LNC. This entry has presented only some of the most immediate issues that arise in objections and replies. \n\nThe modern dialetheic research program has begun to confront itself with some major topics in traditional and\nmainstream philosophy. Among such topics, a prominent one is the\ndebate between\n realists and\n anti-realists\n(for example, idealists and constructivists) in metaphysics. Very\nroughly, to be a realist about entities of some kind is to\nmaintain that such entities objectively exist apart from, and\nantecedently to, anyone’s thought of them; and, therefore, that our\nthoughts, beliefs and theories concerning such entities are made\nobjectively true or objectively false by them, apart from what we\nthink of them (more refined definitions of realism and anti-realism\nare certainly available; but this characterization will suffice for\nour purposes). \n\nIt has been claimed (Priest 2000b, Priest 2006, Ch. 2)\nthat dialetheism is not by itself committed to a specific conception of\ntruth (deflationist, semantic, correspondentist, coherentist,\nconstructivist, etc.). Nevertheless, if we accept even a mild form of\nrealism, the truth of some contradictions entails the existence of\ninconsistent objects and/or states of affairs: those that make the\ncontradictions true (Berto 2007b). One may claim that it makes no\nsense to talk of inconsistent objects, situations, or states of\naffairs. The world is all there, all together: how could some pieces of\nit contradict some other pieces? Consistency and inconsistency\nmight be taken as properties of sentences, or theories (sets of\nsentences closed under logical consequence), or propositions (what\nsentences express), or maybe thoughts, or (sets of) beliefs, etc.\nContradiction (Widerspruch, the Latin contradictio)\nhas to do with discourse (diction, sprechen, dicere).\nThe world, with its non-mental and non-linguistic inhabitants —\narmchairs, trees, people—is not the right kind of\nthing that can be consistent or inconsistent, and ascribing such\nproperties to (a part of) the world is, to use Gilbert Ryle’s\nterminology, a category mistake. \n\nThese considerations might drive dialetheism towards an anti-realist\ninterpretation of the claim that there are dialetheias, true\ncontradictions; and anti-realist dialetheic theories of truth have, in\nfact, been proposed (see e.g. Beall’s ‘constructive\nmethodological deflationism’, in Beall 2004). But other options\nare available to a dialetheist who wants to embrace some form of\nmetaphysically robust realism about truth. For instance, she can\nstress that consistency and inconsistency can be ascribed to (pieces\nof) the world in a derived sense: to say that the world is\n(locally) inconsistent just is to say that some true purely\ndescriptive sentences about the world have true\nnegations. Consequently, and not accidentally, it is quite common in\nthe current literature both for and against dialetheism to\nstraightforwardly speak of inconsistent objects, states of affairs,\nand entire inconsistent worlds. A dialetheic correspondence theory of\ntruth might be committed, in particular, to negative facts (requiring\nthe simultaneous existence of truth-makers both for \\(A\\) and for\nits negation, when \\(A\\) is a dialetheia); but these may be not\ntoo difficult to handle (see e.g. Priest 2006, pp. 51–3). \n\nThere may also be room for a further intermediate position, that is to\nsay, a ‘semantic dialetheism’ which accepts true\ncontradictions without inconsistent objects or states of affairs as\ntheir truth-makers. This position has been explored in the literature (Kroon 2004, Mares 2004). Beall’s\nview, expressed in his transparent truth theory in Beall 2009, may\nalso be seen as a form of semantic dialetheism. Transparency can be\nnaturally paired with a \n deflationary view of truth. \nFor suppose the truth predicate is a merely semantic device, coined,\nas Quine famously stressed, for expressive,\n‘disquotational’ purposes. Then dialetheias such as the\nLiar(s) may well be semantic side-effects (‘spandrels’, in\nBeall’s terminology) of the introduction of such device, not involving\nany metaphysically committing contradiction in a language- and mind-\nindependent world. Woodbridge and Armour-Garb (2013) argue that a deflationary view of truth is best understood in terms\nof semantic pretense (a hermeneutic fictionalist perspective), and on\nthat basis offered a pretense account of the semantic paradoxes. \n\nDebates on realism and anti-realism quickly spill\nover into questions concerning the nature of reality in general, that\nis, into metaphysical issues: if reality is dialetheic, how should the\nontology of a dialetheic world be spelt out? If metaphysics\nshould be placed (once again) at the very core of philosophy, the\ndebate on the possibility of dialetheias occupies a central place in\nthe core. This was, after all, Aristotle’s view, too: he decided to\nspeak on behalf of the unconditional validity of the LNC, not in his\nOrganon (his writings on the subject of logic), but in the\nMetaphysics, for this was for him an issue to be addressed\nontologically, not (only) via formal logical tools. The most detailed work to date in dialetheic metaphysics is probably Priest 2014, which grounds the very unity of objects in an inconsistent theory of parthood and boundary, and applies it to classical issues in metaphysics, such as the One and the Many, and the instantiation of universals. \n\nSince Aristotle, the assumption that consistency is a requirement for truth, validity, meaning, and rationality, has gone largely unchallenged. Modern\ninvestigations into dialetheism, in pressing the possibility of inconsistent theories that are nevertheless meaningful, valid, rational, and true, call that assumption into question. \nIf consistency does turn out to be a necessary condition for any of\nthese notions, dialetheism prompts us to articulate why; just by pushing philosophers to find arguments for what previously were undisputed beliefs renders a valuable service (Scharp 2007, p. 544).\nAnd if consistency turns out not to be an essential requirement for all theories, then the way is\nopen for the rational exploration of areas in philosophy and the sciences that have traditionally been closed\noff.\n\n","contact.mail":"fb96@st-andrews.ac.uk","contact.domain":"st-andrews.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"1998-12-04","date.changed":"2018-06-22","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dialetheism/","author1":"Graham Priest","author2":"Francesco Berto","author1.info":"http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/people/fb96","author2.info":"https://sites.google.com/site/doctorzachweber/home","entry":"dialetheism","body.text":"\n\n\n\nA dialetheia is a sentence, \\(A\\), such that both it\nand its negation, \\(\\neg A\\), are true.\nIf falsity is assumed to be the truth of negation, a dialetheia is a sentence which is both true and false. Such a sentence is, or has, what is called a truth value glut, in distinction to a gap, a sentence that is neither true nor false. (We shall talk of sentences throughout this entry; but one could run the definition in terms of propositions, statements, or whatever one takes as one’s favourite\ntruth-bearer: this would make little difference in the context.)\n\n\n\nDialetheism is the view that there are dialetheias. If we\ndefine a contradiction as a couple of sentences, one of which is the\nnegation of the other, or as a conjunction of such sentences, then dialetheism amounts to the claim that there are true\ncontradictions. As such, dialetheism opposes—contradicts—the Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC), sometimes also called the Law of\nContradiction. The Law can be expressed in various ways; fixing the precise formulation is itself a topic of debate (Priest et al 2004, Part II). Thomas Reid put the LNC\nin the form ‘No proposition is both true and false’. \nA strong (modal) statement of the LNC is: for any \\(A\\), \nit is impossible that both \\(A\\) and\n\\(\\neg A\\) be true. \n\n\n\nIn Book \\(\\Gamma\\) of the Metaphysics, Aristotle introduced\n(what was later to be called) the LNC as “the most certain of all\nprinciples” (1005b24)—firmissimum omnium\nprincipiorum, as the Medieval theologians said. Since Aristotle, there have been few sustained attempts to defend the law. The LNC has been an (often unstated) assumption, felt to be so fundamental to rationality that some claim it cannot be defended, e.g. David Lewis 1999.\nAs a challenge to the LNC, therefore, dialetheism assails what most philosophers take to be unassailable common sense, calling into question the rules for what can be called into question (cf. Woods 2003, 2005; Dutilh Novaes 2008). \n\n\n\n\n\nSince the advent of\nparaconsistent logic in the second half of the twentieth century,\ndialetheism has been developed as a view in philosophical logic, with precise formal language. \nDialetheism has been most famously advanced as a response to logical paradoxes, in tandem with a paraconsistent logic. The view has been gaining, if not acceptance, the respect of other parties in the debate; one critic writes that dialetheists have shown,\n\n\nas clearly as anything like this can be shown, that it is coherent to maintain that some sentences can be true and false at the same time. … [A]nd that perhaps is a radical conclusion, and a major advance in our understanding of the issues (Parsons 1990).\n\n\n\n\nIn this article, 1) we will start by explaining the connection between\ndialetheism and other important related concepts, such as the ones of\ntrivialism and paraconsistency. Next, we will describe 2) the history\nof dialetheism and 3) the motivations for contemporary dialetheism, \namong which the logical (semantic and set-theoretic)\nparadoxes figure prominently, though not exclusively. We will then 4)\nindicate and discuss some of the objections to dialetheism, and 5) its\nconnections with the notion of rationality. Finally, 6) we will point\nat some possible themes for further inquiry concerning the connections\nbetween dialetheism, realism and antirealism in metaphysics.\n\nThe word ‘dialetheism’ was coined\nby Graham Priest and Richard Routley (later Sylvan) in 1981 (Priest et al 1989, p. xx). The inspiration for\nthe name was a passage in Wittgenstein’s Remarks on the Foundations\nof Mathematics, concerning Russell’s paradox (see also below): \nA dialetheia is a two-way truth, facing both truth and falsity like a Janus-headed figure.\nUnfortunately, Priest and Routley forgot to agree how to spell the\n‘ism’, and versions with and without the ‘e’\nappear in print.  \nIn philosophy, there tends not to be a distinction between a view being inconsistent and being incoherent. Both are unacceptable. Since dialetheism claims that some inconsistency can be maintained without incoherence, these two concepts must be disentangled. For a start, dialetheism should be distinguished from so-called trivialism, that claim that all sentences are true, and hence all contradictions are true too (Kabay 2010). Dialetheism is the view that some contradictions are true. \nA trivialist must be a dialetheist, since a trivialist accepts every claim.\nBut since ‘some’ does not imply ‘all’, the converse is not the case: a\ndialetheist typically claims that only some (and, usually, very specific)\nsentences are dialetheias, not that all of them are. Trivialism is by all accounts incoherent, and so is minimally what counts as unacceptable even for someone who thinks that some contradictions are true. \nHow to allow inconsistency without incoherence is one of the main\ntopics of dialetheim. A standard\nsolution consists in subscribing to the view that deductive logical consequence is\n paraconsistent.  A\nlogical consequence relation \\(\\vdash\\) is explosive if,\naccording to it, a contradiction entails everything (ex\ncontradictione quodlibet: for all \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): \n\\(A,\\neg A \\vdash B\\)).  It is paraconsistent if and only if (iff) it is not\nexplosive. By adopting a paraconsistent logic, a dialetheist can\ncountenance some contradictions without being thereby committed to\ncountenancing everything and, in particular, all contradictions.  The\ndevelopment of paraconsistent logics has contributed to the most\nrecent developments (and acceptance of the legitimacy) of\ndialetheism. \n\nDialetheism should, however, be clearly distinguished from\nparaconsistency. Whereas dialetheists must embrace some paraconsistent logic or other to avoid\ntrivialism, paraconsistent logicians need not be dialetheists: they\nmay subscribe to a non-explosive view of entailment for other reasons.\nWithin paraconsistency, one may distinguish (at least) four grades of paraconsistent involvement (Beall and Restall 2006, p.80):\n \nMost people working on paraconsistent logics have commitments at the lower grades of the spectrum. The unifying thought behind\nparaconsistency is gentle-strength: logical consequence should not validate arbitrary conclusions following indiscriminately from inconsistent premises. This may simply be because entailment must preserve more than just truth, e.g., information content, topicality, or some meaningful connection between premises and conclusion. Or it may be that a paraconsistent logician simply need not assume anything about truth in order to provide a working treatment of inconsistency as it may arise in databases, legal situations, works of fiction, theory change, belief-revision, etc. \n \nStepping up, full-strength paraconsistentists treat inconsistent models, in which contradictions hold, as useful mathematical tools without committing to them as representing real possibilities. \n \nAnd stepping up again, industrial-strength paraconsistentists may hold that, though truth at the actual world is consistent, still entailment must preserve what holds in peculiar non-actual situations, some of which may be inconsistent (see Berto, 2007a, Ch. 5, and Priest, Beall and Armour-Garb, 2004, p. 6). The first three levels appear to be independent of dialetheism. (But for reason to worry that there is a ‘slippery slope’ from gentle to dialetheic paraconsistency, see Priest 2000. For particular worries about model theory, see Asmus 2012, and in the modal case, Martin 2015.)\n \nAt the top of the spectrum, dialethiec paraconsistency holds that some contradictions are, in some sense, true in the actual world.\nEven among full-fledged dialetheists, differences remain, for example,\nin what is meant by “true”, e.g., on whether they subscribe to a \n deflationary theory of truth, \na correspondence view, a view in which true contradictions are merely semantic, or something else. \nWe will come back to this point in section 6 below. \n\n\nWe said at the outset that dialetheism challenges the LNC. Now this claim needs some qualification, since forms of the \nLNC are, in fact, accepted as a general logical law in dialetheism, at least in versions based in e.g. the paraconsistent logic LP. \nDialetheism as set out by Priest takes all instances of the schema \\(\\neg(A \\wedge \\neg A)\\) to be true, as well as taking as true some sentences that are inconsistent with it, namely, true sentences whose negations are true: dialetheias. According to such versions of dialetheism, all contradictions are false and some are true: dialetheism is itself a dialetheia (‘Concluding self-referential postscript’ to Priest 1979, p. 203).\n \n\nMuch of the ongoing discussion about dialetheism involves not just the LNC but its dual, the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM). (See section 3.2 below.) The LEM says (informally) that for every sentence \\(A\\), either \\(A\\) or \\(\\neg A\\) is true (we bracket here views that disentangle the LEM from Bivalence). \nDialetheism is the thesis that there are truth value gluts, challenging the LNC; the dual position, challenging the LEM, is that there are truth value gaps. It is a subtle issue, which we will not discuss\nhere, whether a gap should count as lacking any \ntruth value, or as having a non-classical value distinct from both truth and\nfalsity, and similarly whether a glut has two truth values, or some third ‘glutty’ value. In any case, these dual approaches are nowadays labelled\nparacomplete versus (paraconsistent) dialetheic theories of truth.\n(The paraconsistent/paracomplete terminology is not entirely happy: see Ripley 2015a, footnote 1; but is now standard.)\nPriest’s logic includes the LEM and he rejects the existence of gaps in Priest 1987/2006, ch.1. Other approaches are both paracomplete and paraconsistent; they include a place for both gaps and gluts. The case for and against dialetheism turns as much on the status of the LEM as the LNC; see Beall and Ripley 2018. While the word ‘dialetheism’ is relatively new, the idea is not. In this section we note some points in the history of philosophy where true contradictions appear salient, either explicitly or implicitly. (Much of this scholarship is due originally to Priest and Routley 1983, and Priest 1995/2002.) Then we address methodological issues to do with historical interpretation, and give a quick sketch of more recent history. Aristotle takes a number of the Presocratics to endorse dialetheism, and with\napparent justification. For example, in Fragment 49a, Heraclitus says:\n“We step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and we are\nnot” (Robinson, 1987, p. 35). Protagorean relativism may be\nexpressed by the view that man is the measure of all things; but according\nto Aristotle, since “Many men hold beliefs in which they\nconflict with one another”, it follows that “the same\nthing must be and not be” (1009a10–12). The Presocratic\nviews triggered Aristotle’s attack in Metaphysics, Book\n\\(\\Gamma\\). Chapter 4 of this Book contains Aristotle’s defence of the\nLNC. As we said above, historically Aristotle was almost completely\nsuccessful: the LNC has been orthodoxy in Western Philosophy ever\nsince. \nAs an aside, and as mentioned above, there is an often-remarked upon duality between truth-value gaps and truth-value gluts (Parsons 1990). And yet, \nit is perhaps worth noting that in Metaphysics \\(\\Gamma\\)\n(Chapter 7) Aristotle also defends the dual of the LNC, the Law of\nExcluded Middle, LEM, particularly in the version which has nowadays\nbeen distinguished as the Law of Bivalence: for any \\(A\\), it is\nnecessary for (at least) one of \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) to be\ntrue. But the LEM has often had a less secure place in Western\nPhilosophy than the LNC, in spite of the numerous obvious dualities\nbetween the two principles. Aristotle himself, at least according to one interpretation, appears to\nattack the Law in De Interpretatione, Chapter 9, when he\ncomes to the famous subject of future contingents. \n\nDespite the orthodoxy about the LNC since Aristotle, during the Middle Ages the problem\nof seemingly true contradictions surfaced in connection to the\nparadoxes of divine omnipotence—for instance: can God make\na stone too heavy for Him to lift? (See Cotnoir forthcoming.) We find St. Pier Damiani getting close to dialetheism in the De divina omnipotentia, by\nblaming St. Girolamus for having claimed that God cannot overturn the\npast and twist what happened into something that didn’t happen. Since\nGod lives an eternal present, denying Him power over the past equates\nto denying Him power over current and future events, which is\nblasphemous. So God must have the power of making what is done\nundone. Later on, Nicholas of Cusa placed at the core of his\nbook De docta ignorantia the idea that God is\ncoincidentia oppositorum: as a truly infinite being, He\nincludes all opposite and incompatible properties, therefore being\nall things, and none of them: God has all properties, including\ncontradictory ones (Heron, 1954, I.4). \n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant argues that some contradictions, the antinomies of pure reason (concerning time, space, and other categories), are produced by an illicit use of pure concepts; nevertheless, he also holds such an illicit use\nto be a “natural and inevitable illusion” (Kant, 1781, p.\n300)—a side effect of reason’s pursuit of completeness in\nknowledge. \nReasoning about the world as a whole, a totality which is never given to us as such, can lead us to apparently dialetheic conclusions: e.g. that it has a beginning in time and a limit in\nspace, and that it has no beginning nor limits in space, that it is\ninfinite in space and time. Both horns assume the opposite thesis and\nseemingly perform a reductio. (In Kantian terms, the “transcendental\nillusion” begins when we turn what should just be a regulative\nideal into a limit-object.) According to Kant, at least in\none way of resolving the antinomies, the fallacy lies in treating the\nworld as a whole as an object—in mistaking a subjective\n“condition”, as Kant says, for an objective reality. \n\nNow, according to Hegel such a conception has something to be said for\nit as well as against it. Kant has a point in showing, via the\nantinomies, that dialectics is “a necessary function of\nreason”, and in defending “the necessity of the\ncontradiction which belongs to the nature of thought\ndeterminations” (Hegel, 1831, p. 56). However, Kant takes from this only the familiar result that reason is incapable of knowing the Absolute,\nthat is, actual reality. A dialetheic interpretation holds that, on the contrary, we should abandon such\n“tenderness for the things of this world”, and the idea\nthat “the stain of contradiction ought not to be in the essence\nof what is in the world; it has to belong only to thinking\nreason” (Hegel, 1830, p. 92). On a dialetheic interpretation, contrary to what Kant held, the\nKantian antinomies are not a\nreductio of the illusions of reason; they are perfectly sound\narguments, deducing the dialetheic nature of the world. (For a\nreconstruction of this Kantian-Hegelian debate, see Part II of Priest\n2002.) \n\nIn non-Western traditions, there are more overt examples of what appears to be dialetheic thought. \nIn ancient Indian logic/metaphysics, there were standardly four possibilities to be\nconsidered on any statement at issue: that it is true (only), false\n(only), neither true nor false, or both true and false. \nSome logicians added a fifth possibility: none of these. Both\npositions were, arguably, called catushkoti (Priest 2002, ch.16; Deguchi et al 2008; Tillemans 2009.) The Jains went even\nfurther and advocated the possibility of contradictory values of the\nkind: true (only) and both true and false (see Smart 1964). \n \nContradictory utterances are a commonplace in Daoism, perhaps most famously in Laozi (Lao-Tsu): on one translation, \na statement which appears to be speaking about the true Way. The Zhuangzi says: “That which makes things has no boundaries with\nthings, but for things to have boundaries is what we mean by saying\n‘the boundaries between things’. The boundaryless boundary is the\nboundary without a boundary” (Mair, 1994, p. 218). When Buddhism and\nDaoism fused to form Chan (or Zen, to give it its Japanese name), a\nphilosophy arose in which contradiction plays a central role. The very\nprocess for reaching enlightenment (Prajna) is a process, according to\nSuzuki (1969, p. 55), “which is at once above and in the process of\nreasoning. This is a contradiction, formally considered, but in truth,\nthis contradiction is itself made possible because of Prajna.” \nRecent discussions of dialetheism have centered on Buddhist thought in particular, where some interpreters argue that texts invoke outright contradictions. For example, in the Mahayana tradition, Nagarjuna presents many passages similar in form to: \nOn a dialetheic interpretation, advocated by Priest, Garfield, and Deguchi (see Priest 2002 ch.16, Deguchi et al 2008), readers should take Nagarjuna and others in the Madhyamaka school at their word—not as invoking some sort of mysticism, but as affirming the nature of reality. This is most salient in Nagarjuna’s doctrine of emptiness (sunyata), that all things are empty or lacking independent existence (svabhava). Since all things are empty, it follows that emptiness is empty too; or, more prosaically, “The ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth” (Siderits 2007, p.182; Priest 2002, p.260). These utterances, if true, would appear to be self-contradictory, and therefore dialetheias.  \nFor work on dialetheism in Buddhism, see the collections Garfield et al 2009 and Tanaka et al 2015. For discussion as to whether dialetheism is the appropriate way to interpret Buddhist texts, see the papers in Tanaka 2013. For more general difficulties see the entry on comparative philosophy: Chinese and Western. \n\nInterpreting the philosophers we have mentioned is a\nsensitive issue. \n\nMany commentators have suggested that the seemingly contradictory\nutterances of the philosophers in question are not really\ncontradictory. There are a number of standard devices that may be\nemployed to block a dialetheic interpretation. One is to question, in the case of non-English sources, whether the apparently contradictory translation is correct. Another is to claim that the contradictory utterance is to\nbe taken as having some non-literal form of meaning, e.g., that it is\na metaphor, or a way of pointing towards some higher, ineffable truth. \nAnother is to claim that the contradictory assertion is\nambiguous in some way, and that it is true on one disambiguation or respect, false in another. \nThis last technique is\ncalled parameterisation: when\none is confronted with a seemingly true contradiction, \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\), treat the suspected\ndialetheia \\(A\\), or some of its parts, as having different\nmeanings, and hence as ambiguous (maybe just contextually\nambiguous). For instance, if one claims that \\(P(a) \\wedge \\neg P(a)\\), parameterisation holds that one is\nin effect claiming that \\(P_1 (a) \\wedge \\neg P_2 (a)\\) (e.g. elephants are big and not big, because they are big in the context of land animals on Earth, but not big in the context of stars and planets). In the\nMetaphysics, Aristotle hints that a critic of the LNC\nis playing with the equivocal meanings of some words: “for to each definition there might be assigned a different\nword” (1006b 1–2). \n\nNo one would dispute that contradictory utterances are sometimes best construed parametrically. (Again, dialetheists do not claim that all contradictory statements are true.) The question is whether parameterisation is the best approach\nin the case of the philosophers we have mentioned; answering this in a dialetheic context is a matter for\ndetailed case-by-case consideration. A defender of the dialetheic interpretation would say that consistent parameterisation produces an inaccurate and\ndistorted version of the views of the philosopher in question. In any\ncase, even if parameterisation is always possible, this does not impact arguments for or against the LNC. An a priori claim that contradictions\ncan always be avoided by parameterisation does not show, without begging the question, the correctness of such interpretations: sometimes parameterisation may be the best thing to do,\nbut independent justification should be given on each occasion. \n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, with the rapid development of paraconsistent logics, came the modern form of dialetheism. \nIn 1966, Asenjo published a short note, “A Calculus of Antinomies”, based on his 1954 PhD dissertation; the opening line reads \nHere, having two truth values would mean being both true and false, a glut, or what Asenjo calls (following Kant) an antinomy. Asenjo simply seems to assume without further ado that there are antinomies, and in Asenjo and Tamburino 1975 asserts that they are “useful logical entities”, especially for dealing with paradoxes in mathematical contexts. Born in Buenos Aires, Asenjo came to the University of Pittsburg in 1963 as a professor in the mathematics faculty, where he was in contact with logicians such as Belnap, Anderson, their student Dunn (who thanks Asenjo in his 1966 PhD thesis, that also toys with true contradictions), and nearby, Meyer. By the mid-1970s, Richard Routley (Sylvan), in collaboration with Meyer, was developing a ‘dialectical’ position that rebukes what they call “the consistency hypothesis” and accepts some statements as both true and false (Routley and Meyer 1976; Routley 1977, 1979). In 1979, Priest’s paper “The Logic of Paradox”, developed eventually into the book In Contradiction (1987/2006), presented what are now the most famous arguments for dialetheism. In the collaboration between Priest and Routley, the contemporary dialetheic program was launched. Much of Priest and Routley’s early joint work is summarised in Priest et al 1989 (also available as Priest and Routley 1983). More recent developments are canvassed below.\n \nProbably the master argument used by modern\ndialetheists invokes the logical\n paradoxes of self-reference.\nIt is customary to distinguish between two families of such\nparadoxes: semantic and set-theoretic. The former family typically\ninvolves such concepts as truth, denotation,\ndefinability, etc; the latter, such notions as\nmembership, cardinality, etc. After Gödel’s and\nTarski’s well known formal procedures to obtain non-contextual\nself-reference in formalized languages, it is difficult to draw a sharp\nline between the two families, among other things, because of the fact\nthat Tarskian semantics is itself framed in set-theoretic terms.\nNevertheless, the distinction is commonly accepted within the relevant\nliterature. \n\nRussell’s paradox is \nthe most famous of the set-theoretic paradoxes; it arises when\none considers the set of all non self-membered sets, the Russell set. Cantor’s paradox arises in connection with the universal set. The most famous of the semantic paradoxes is the \nLiar paradox. \nAlthough cases for the existence of dialetheias\ncan be made from almost any paradox of self-reference, we will focus\nonly on the Liar, given that it is the most easily understandable and\nits exposition requires no particular technicalities. \n\nIn its standard version, the Liar paradox arises by reasoning on the\nfollowing sentence: \n(1): (1) is false\n \nwhere the number to the left is the name of the sentence to the right.\nAs we can see, (1) refers to itself and tells us something about (1)\nitself. Its truth value? Let us reason by cases. Suppose (1) is true:\nthen what it says is the case, so it is false. Then, suppose (1) is\nfalse: this is what it claims to be, so it is true. If we accept the\naforementioned Law of Bivalence, that is, the principle according to\nwhich all sentences are either true or false, both alternatives lead to\na contradiction: (1) is both true and false, that is, a dialetheia,\ncontrary to the LNC. \n\nThe paradox can also be produced without any direct self-reference,\nbut via a short-circuit of sentences. For instance, here is a looped\nLiar: \n(2a): (2b) is true \n(2b): (2a) is false \n\nIf what (2a) says is true, then (2b) is\ntrue. However, (2b) says that (2a) is false …. And so on: we\nare in a paradoxical loop. This is as old as Buridan (his Sophism no. 9: Plato saying ‘What Socrates says is true’; Socrates replying ‘ What Plato says is false’).\n \n\nParadoxes of this kind have been known since antiquity (the standard Liar is attributed to the Greek philosopher Eubulides,\nprobably the greatest paradox-producer of antiquity). But they were\nthrown into prominence by developments in the foundations of\nmathematics around the turn of the twentieth century. In the case of\neach paradox, there appears to be a perfectly sound argument ending in\na contradiction. If the arguments are sound, then dialetheism is true.\nOf course, many have argued that the soundness of such arguments is\nmerely an appearance, and that subtle fallacies may be diagnosed in\nthem. Such suggestions were made in ancient and medieval logic; but\nmany more have been made in modern logic—indeed, attacking the\nparadoxes has been something of a leitmotiv of modern logic.\nAnd one thing that appears to have come out of this is how resilient\nthe paradoxes are: attempts to solve them often simply succeed in\nrelocating the paradoxes elsewhere, as so called\n‘strengthened’ forms of the arguments show. Let us have a\nlook. \n\nA radical solution, which never won big consensus but has been revitalised in recent times (Pleitz 2018), has it that there just cannot be meaningful self-rererential sentences. Various works (notably Martin 1967, van Fraassen 1968, Kripke\n1975, Field 2008) have proposed to solve the Liar paradox by\ndismissing Bivalence, whereby some sentences are\nneither true nor false, and the Liar is one such truth value\n‘gap’.\nTruth value gaps, and the\ninclusion of the Liar among them, are differently motivated in the\nvarious approaches. But the common core thought is the following: even though\nthe Liar is a sentence such that, if it were true, it would be false,\nand vice versa, no explicit contradiction according to which\nit is both true and false need follow. We can avoid the contradiction\nby rejecting the idea that truth and falsity are the only two options\nfor a sentence: the Liar is neither. For a comparative survey of the two kinds of approach, see Beall and\nRipley 2018. \n\nThese approaches face difficulties with the so-called\n‘strengthened’ Liars—sentences such as the\nfollowing: \n(3): (3) is not true. \n(4): (4) is false or neither true nor false. \n\nNow these sentences should be, on the gappy theorist’s non-bivalent approach,\neither true, or false, or neither. But, for instance, if (3) is true,\nthen things are as it claims they are; therefore, (3) is not true\n(either false or truth-valueless). If (3) is false, or neither true\nnor false, in both cases it is not true; but this is precisely what it\nclaims to be; therefore, it is true. We seem to have to conclude that\n(3) is both true and not true, contrary to the LNC. A similar line of\nreasoning goes for (4). \n\nAccording to Priest the strengthened Liars show that a single feature\nof the semantic paradox underlies its different formulations. The\ntotality of sentences is divided into two subsets: the true ones, and\ntheir ‘bona fide complement’—call it\nthe Rest. Now the essence of the liar is “a particular\ntwisted construction which forces a sentence, if it is in the bona\nfide truths, to be in the Rest (too); conversely, if it is in the\nRest, it is in the bona fide truths” (Priest 1987, p. 23). The\nstandard Liar, ‘This sentence is false’, is just a\nparticular instance of this, producing a contradiction within the\nbivalent framework, in which the Rest is identified with the set of\nthe false sentences. We can try to resolve the problem by\nadmitting sentences that are neither true nor false, so that the false\nones become a proper subset of the Rest. However, the strengthened\nLiars show that we can use the notions introduced to solve the\nprevious paradox to re-describe the Rest. Once the set of sentences is partitioned into a trichotomy\n(true, false, and neither true nor false), the disjunctive\n‘This sentence is false or neither true nor false’ embraces the whole Rest, i.e. the new(ly described) complement\nof the set of the true sentences. What about adding more values? If there is some fourth thing that a sentence can be, besides true, false, and neither true nor false, we can always take\nthe notion\nfourth thing and produce another strengthened Liar: \n(5): (5) is false, or neither true nor false, or the fourth thing.\n \nSee Kirkham 1992, pp. 293–4.\nThese strengthened liars are also called revenge liars, and the general phenomenon we have just witnessed has become known as revenge; see Beall 2007, e.g. the introduction, and Cook 2007, among other essays.   There is no generally agreed upon solution to the semantic paradoxes. One typical way out attempted by the supporters of truth value gaps, for instance, consists in\ndenying that the notion of gap, or defective\nsentence, or sentence whose truth value is\nindeterminate, can be fully expressed in the language for which\nthey are proposing their theory of truth. The strengthened paradoxes\nthen seem to force the consistent theorist to admit that the proposed\ntheory was formulated in a language different from, and expressively\nmore powerful than, the one whose semantics it was supposed to\nexpress. This entails a limitation of the Tarskian T-schema\ncharacterising truth, i.e., of the\nequivalence \nwhere\n‘\\(Tr\\)’ is the truth predicate for the relevant\nlanguage, and \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) is the appropriate name of\nsentence \\(A\\). This approach makes a rigid distinction between an\nobject language and its metalanguage. Such a distinction was\nintroduced by Tarski to expel the Liar paradox from formalized\nlanguages—but Tarski himself insisted that his solution is inapplicable to natural languages, which do not appear to depend upon some\nmetalanguage for their semantics. As Kripke admits at the end\nof Outline of a Theory of Truth, “the ghost of the\nTarski hierarchy is still with us” (scil. the paracompletists:\nsee Kripke 1975, p. 80). Tarski, in short, identified the cause of the semantic paradoxes to be semantic closure—the fact that natural languages such as English satisfy the T-schema. Tarski took this to mean that there can be no consistent formalization of a semantically complete language, only a approximation thereof stratified into metalanguages. Dialetheists agree, but draw the conclusion in the other direction: the appropriate formalization of a language such as ours, because it is semantically closed and is not hierarchically stratified, will be inconsistent (Priest 1987, ch.1, Beall 2009, ch.1). \n\nThese two features—a claimed immunity to revenge/strengthened liars, and dispensing with the object-language/metalanguage distinction—are argued to give dialetheism about the paradoxes of self-reference some of its major appeal. As Shapiro (in a critical note) puts it, dialetheists offer that we \nThe simplicity of a dialetheic theory of truth, then, is claimed as an additional further feature. The\ntwo most prominent such theories to date are presented in Priest\n1987, and Beall 2009. In the former, the truth predicate \\(Tr\\)\nfor the relevant formal language, modelling the behaviour of truth in\nEnglish, is simply characterized by the unrestricted T-schema, \\(Tr\\langle A\\rangle \\leftrightarrow A\\), which,\nas stressed by many philosophers, is an overwhelmingly \nintuitive—perhaps even analytic—principle\nconcerning truth. It is admitted that some sentences—notably,\nthe Liars—are truth value gluts, that is, both true and false\n(the construction may also sustain sentences which are both true and\nnot true, although not all dialetheias need be of this kind); and no\nhierarchy of metalanguages or further epicycles are needed. \n\nBeall’s 2009 theory allows a fully transparent truth predicate: one such that\nfor any sentence \\(A\\), \\(Tr\\langle A\\rangle\\)\nand \\(A\\) can be replaced with each other in all (non-opaque)\ncontexts salva veritate, that is, producing sentences\nlogically equivalent to the sentences one started with. Then the\nunrestricted T-schema follows from transparency (and the fact\nthat \\(A \\rightarrow A\\) is a logical truth) as a special\ncase. In Beall’s theory, all sentences \\(A\\) that are\ndialetheias are not only true and false, i.e. (given that falsity is\ntruth of negation), \\(Tr\\langle A\\rangle \\wedge Tr\\langle \\neg A\\rangle\\); they are also true and\nuntrue, \\(Tr\\langle A\\rangle \\wedge \\neg Tr\\langle A\\rangle\\): this again follows from the\ntransparency of truth. Beall’s theory is based on a (relevant) paraconsistent logic,\nwhose modal semantics employs so-called\n non-normal worlds. \n \n\nOverall, such paradoxes as the Liar provide some evidence for the\ndialetheist’s claim that some contradictions are provably\ntrue, in the sense that they are entailed by plain facts concerning\nnatural language and our thought processes. Extended Liar paradoxes\nlike ‘This sentence is not true’ are spelt in ordinary\nEnglish. Their paradoxical characteristics, dialetheists argue,\nare due exactly to the intuitive features of ordinary language:\nunavoidable self-reference; the failure of metalinguistic hierarchies,\nwhich only produce languages that are expressively weaker than English;\nand the obvious presence of a truth predicate for English, ‘is\ntrue’, which is characterized, at least extensionally, by either the Tarskian T-schema or rules amounting to the transparency of truth. For a sustained critical engagement with paraconsistent dialetheism as a solution to the semantic paradoxes, see Field 2008, part 5 (chapters 23–26). \nIn the larger family of paradoxes of self-reference beyond the semantic, \ndialetheism affords a treatment of the set-theoretic paradoxes. These paradoxes arise in set theories based on an unrestricted ‘comprehension\nschema’ for sets: for any condition or property, including\nparadoxical ones like non-self-membership, there exists a\ncorresponding set. In particular, inconsistent sets like Russell’s are admitted; analogously to the Liar, the Russell set\nis and is not a member of itself. As with the truth schema, the set comprehension principle seems very natural and intuitive, and such\ncontradictions do not give rise to triviality due to the\nparaconsistent logic underlying the formal theories. Though the\nissue is too technical to be addressed here, and more appropriately\ndealt with in the entries on\n paraconsistent logic\nand \n inconsistent mathematics, \nthe reader can consult Routley 1979, Brady 1989, for inconsistent set theories, and Weber 2012 for recent results in the field. See also Mortensen 1995. For different approaches to dialetheic set theory, see Restall 1992 and Ripley 2015b. \nSince dialetheism appears to resolve both the semantic and set theoretic paradoxes at once and in the same sort of way (namely, accept the contradictory outcomes as true), this has been presented as another major strong point for dialetheism. Priest argues that the paradoxes share an underlying structure (which he calls the Inclosure Schema in Priest 2002). This is used in tandem with what Priest dubs the principle of uniform solution (“same kind of paradox, same kind of solution”) to urge that, since all the set theoretic and semantic paradoxes are of a kind, then dialetheism presents a uniquely unified solution. \n \nA point of dispute about the dialetheic approach to the paradoxes of self-reference concerns the Curry paradox. \nThis is produced by a self-referential sentence claiming ‘If I\nam true, then \\(\\bot\\)’, where \\(\\bot\\) is a constant (what\nlogicians usually call the falsum) which is or entails\nsomething that is also dialetheically unacceptable, say \\(\\bot =\\)\n‘Everything is true’, the incoherent trivialist claim. \nPrima\nfacie, this does not involve negation, nor a falsity\npredicate. However, many logicians think that Curry’s paradox is very similar to the Liar, and therefore by the principle of uniform solution that it should be handled in the same way. A dialetheist, though, cannot simply accept that the Curry sentence is both true and false, because if it is true then \\(\\bot\\) follows. Dialetheists need a different treatment of Curry. A standard dialetheic strategy to deal with the\nCurry paradox has consisted in exploiting paraconsistent logics with a\n‘noncontractive’ conditional (see again Priest 1987, Ch,\n6, Beall 2009, Ch. 2), \nwhich do not validate the Contraction (or Absorption) Law, i.e., the rule:\nfrom \\(A \\rightarrow(A \\rightarrow B)\\) infer \\(A \\rightarrow B\\), or the so-called pseudo-modus ponens\nprinciple \\((A \\wedge(A \\rightarrow B)) \\rightarrow B\\). \n Stronger forms of the paradox, though, validity curry, seem to show that dropping these principles is not enough (Beall and Murzi\n2013). This leads to contraction-free logics within the broader\nfamily of substructural logics (Restall 2000, Priest 2015), and indeed substructural dialetheic approaches that drop principles other than contraction, such as transitivity (Ripley 2012).\nCurry’s paradox puts pressure on the dialetheic story about uniform solution to the paradoxes. Beall (2014a, 2014b) urges this point; Weber et al 2014 is a reply.\n \n\nDialetheias produced by the paradoxes of self-reference are confined to the abstract realm of notions such as set or to semantic concepts such as truth. However, the paradoxes of self-reference\nare not the only examples of dialetheias that have been mooted. Other\ncases involve contradictions affecting concrete objects and the\nempirical world, and include the following. \n\n(1) Transition states: when I exit the room, I am inside the\nroom at one time, and outside of it at another. Given the continuity\nof motion, there must be a precise instant in time, call it \\(t\\), at\nwhich I leave the room. Am I inside the room or outside at time \\(t\\)?\nFour answers are available: (a) I am inside; (b) I am outside; (c) I\nam both; and (d) I am neither. There is a strong intuition that (a)\nand (b) are ruled out by symmetry considerations: choosing either\nwould be completely arbitrary. (This intuition is not at all unique to\ndialetheists: see the article on boundaries\nin general.) As for (d): if I am neither inside not outside the room,\nthen I am not inside and not-not inside; therefore, I am either inside\nand not inside (option (c)), or not inside and not-not inside (which\nfollows from option (d)); in both cases, a dialetheic situation. Or so\nit has been argued. For a recent description of inconsistent\nboundaries using formal mereology, see Weber and Cotnoir 2015. \n\n(2) Some of Zeno’s paradoxes concerning a \nparticular—though, perhaps, the most basic—kind of transition,\nthat is, local motion: a moving arrow is both where it is,\nand where it is not. In any given instant, argues Zeno, it cannot move to where it is, since it is already there, and it cannot move to somewhere else, because there isn’t time for it to get there. The orthodox way out of the paradoxical situation,\nas formulated, e.g., by Russell 1903, has it that motion is the mere\noccupation of different places at different times. But one could argue that this\nis denial of the phenomenon itself, that is, of the actuality of motion:\nRussell’s solution entails that motion is not an intrinsic state of the\n(allegedly) moving thing, for, at each instant, the arrow is not moving\nat all. Can a going-somewhere be composed by an (even\ncontinuum-sized) infinity of going-nowheres? An alternative,\ndialetheic account of motion, which takes at face value the\naforementioned Hegelian idea that “Something moves, not because at one\nmoment it is here and another there, but because at one and the same\nmoment it is here and not here, because in this ‘here’, it at once is\nand is not”, is exposed in Priest 1987, Ch. 12. \n\n(3) Borderline cases of vague predicates. Popular approaches to\nvagueness and the \n sorites paradox, such as the ones based on many-valued logics, or\nsupervaluations, require some under-determinacy of reference, and/or\nthe rejection of Bivalence: if an adolescent, \\(m\\), is a\nborderline case of adultness, \\(A\\), then \\(A(m)\\)\nmay turn out to have an intermediate truth value between truth and\nfalsity, or no truth value at all. But it may be conjectured that a\nborderline object like \\(m\\), instead of satisfying neither a\nvague predicate nor its negation, satisfies them both: an adolescent\nboth is and is not an adult. Given the obvious dualities between the\nLEM and the Law of Bivalence on the one side, and (respectively,\nsyntactic and semantic formulations of) the LNC on the other, it is\nnot too difficult to envisage a ‘sub-valuational’ semantic\napproach, dual to the supervaluation strategy. Sub-valuational\nparaconsistent semantics have been proposed by Hyde (1997), and Varzi\n(1997). Other ‘glutty’ approaches to vagueness have\nbeen proposed by Colyvan (2009), Weber (2010), Priest (2010),\nRipley (2013), and Cobreros et al (2010, 2015), motivated on both theoretical and empirical grounds. \n\nIf inconsistencies due to vague predicates and borderline objects are taken to be \ndue to merely semantic under- and over-\ndetermination of ordinary language (de dicto), then this is further evidence for dialetheism about semantics. If the aforementioned phenomena are taken to be not just about words but things (de re), then actually inconsistent objects are admitted, together with vague objects. And this spreads\ninconsistency all over the empirical world: if borderline cases can be\ninconsistent, inconsistent objects are more or less everywhere, given\nhow pervasive the phenomenon of vagueness notoriously is: adolescents,\nborderline bald men, etc. Inconsistency is observable (Beall and Colyvan 2001). Beall argues against the approach in Ch. 5 of Beall 2009, and Beall 2014a. \n\n(4) Multi-criterial predicates. We may assume that the\nsemantics of a predicate is specified by means of its criteria of\napplication. Now ordinary language hosts predicates with different, and\noccasionally conflicting, criteria of application (e.g., ‘left wing’): some criteria for\napplying a predicate \\(P\\) (e.g., caring about social welfare, raising minimum wages) may entail that object \\(m\\) (e.g., a political party) is in the\nextension of the predicate, some others (promoting nationalism, oppressing immigrants), that \\(m\\) is in its\nanti-extension, or negative extension. Criteria can in some cases be\nencoded by such things as meaning postulates (or other similar, albeit\nmore sophisticated, semantic devices); but conflicting meaning\npostulates may be embedded in our standard linguistic practices, and\ndifficult to detect and identify. If the extensions of our ordinary\npredicates are constrained by our intuitions, and such intuitions turn\nout to be inconsistent, a good semantic account of the situation may\nwell have to reflect this fact (accepting, in our example, that a party counts as both left and right wing), instead of destroying it by means of\nsome regimentation (e.g. via the usual parameterisation, or distinction\nof respects). As Priest 1987, pp 67–9, clarifies, it is also hard to analyse such situations as cases of vagueness (so that a party has to be understood as being left wing to some degree, and right wing to some degree). \n\n(5) Certain legal situations, such as inconsistent bodies of\nlaw. Suppose, for instance, that some norm states that a marriage\nperformed by the captain of a ship counts as a legal marriage only if\nthe ship was in open water throughout the ceremony. It turns out,\nthen, that some other law has established that such a marriage is\nvalid also if the ceremony has only begun with the ship in open water,\nbut has ended with the ship in the port. Then someone may turn out to\nbe both a married man and not a married man. (Since it does not appear to follow that he is not a man anymore, or both a man and not a man, we have another putative counterexample\nto ex contradictione quodlibet). If one accepts the plausible\nview that statements concerning legal rights, obligations, and\nstatuses, can be truth-value apt, we seem to have a dialetheia. Of\ncourse, legal systems sometimes have mechanisms that can be used to\nremove such inconsistencies (e.g., by ordering different kinds of laws\nin a hierarchy from customary laws, to established jurisprudence, to\nordinary legislation, to constitutional norms, etc.; or via\nthe lex posterior principle, giving priority to the more\nrecent norm in case of conflict). But this is not always the case: the\ninconsistent laws may be of the same rank, enacted at the same time,\netc. For a recent discussion, see Beall 2016. \n\nEach of the above arguments undoubtedly calls for further\ndevelopment. Priest 1987 includes detailed discussions of all of them. Ficara 2014 includes recent work. \n\nWe now turn to arguments against dialetheism. The most prominent sustained\ndefence of the LNC in the history of philosophy is, as mentioned, that given by Aristotle in Chapter 4 of Metaphysics,\n\\(\\Gamma\\). A critical analysis of Aristotle’s arguments is given point-for-point by Priest (1998b/2006 ch.1), who finds them to often conflate dialetheism with trivialism (that\nis, conflating the claim that some contradictions are true, and\nthe one that all contradictions are). We will look at some more modern arguments against dialetheism. \n\nA standard argument against dialetheism is to invoke the\nlogical principle of Explosion, in virtue of which dialetheism would\nentail trivialism. Granted that trivialism is absurd (though see Priest 2000a,\nPriest 2006, Ch. 3, and Kabay 2010), dialetheism must be\nrejected. Since this argument assumes that explosion is logically valid, it will carry no weight against a dialetheic paraconsistentist. \n\nInterestingly enough, while Aristotle’s defence of the LNC\nmay slide between attacking dialetheism and trivialism, Aristotelian syllogistic —\nthe first formally articulated logic in Western philosophy—is\nnot explosive. Aristotle held that some syllogisms with inconsistent\npremises are valid, whereas others are not (An. Pr. 64a 15). Just\nconsider the inference: \n(P1) Some logicians are intuitionists; \n(P2) No intuitionist is a logician; \n(C) Therefore, all logicians are logicians. \n\nThis is not a valid syllogism, despite the fact that its premises\nare inconsistent. The principle of Explosion had a certain tenure at\nplaces and times in Medieval logic, but it became well-established\nmainly with the Fregean and post-Fregean development of what is now called classical\nlogic. For the logical aspects of denying explosion, see the article on paraconsistent logic. \nThere are several objections to dialetheism involving the notion\nof exclusion. The very rough idea is that dialetheists have\nlet in more truths than non-dialetheists, but subsequently now\nhave trouble keeping enough falisity out.  This objection, in\none form or another, has been a recurring theme in criticisms of\ndialetheism.\n \nA version of the argument from exclusion against dialetheism found, for instance, in McTaggart 1922 (see Berto\n2006, 2012) is as follows. A sentence is meaningful only if it rules\nsomething out. But if the LNC fails, \\(A\\) does not rule out\n\\(\\neg A\\), or, a fortiori, anything else. Hence\nmeaningful language presupposes the LNC. \n\nThere are problems one may find with this argument. One is that\neven though a dialetheia does not rule out its negation, it still may\nrule out several other things. A bigger trouble is that the\nfirst premise looks to be simply false. Consider again the sentence\n‘Everything is true’. This entails everything, and so\nrules out nothing. Yet it is meaningful. It is something that\neveryone, except a trivialist, rejects. \n\nOne might attempt a more sophisticated explanation of the notion of\nruling out, for instance in terms of information theory, or\nperhaps possible worlds. One may claim that a statement ‘rules\nout’ something insofar as there are situations, or worlds, at\nwhich it fails. In this sense, ‘Everything is true’ does\nrule something out. But now, it is this account of propositional\nmeaning which can be challenged in general. If mathematical truths have a\nstrictly necessary status (which may safely be assumed here), Fermat’s\nLast Theorem rules out nothing: being a necessary truth, it holds at\nall possible worlds. But it is perfectly meaningful; people wondered whether it was true or false for centuries; and its proof by\nAndrew Wiles was a substantial discovery.  \nOne argument from exclusion, \nwith a more ad hominem twist, claims that the dialetheist has trouble with expressing disagreement with rival positions in debates (see Parsons 1990, Shapiro 2004, Littman and\nSimmons 2004). For when the\ndialetheist utters ‘\\(\\neg A\\)’, this is in itself\ninsufficient to rule out that \\(A\\) is the case, given that, in a\ndialetheic world, it may well be that both \\(A\\) and\n\\(\\neg A\\). Similarly, ‘\\(A\\) is false’ and even\n‘\\(A\\) is not true’ might not do the trick, since for\nthe dialetheist some \\(A\\)’s being false, or untrue, does not\nrule out its being true. As Parsons puts it, \nElaborations and repetitions of this line of thought have come to be\nknown in the literature as the ‘just true’ or ‘true\nonly’ problem, e.g. Rossberg 2013. (Young 2015, however, argues\nthat the exclusion problem is distinct from the just-true problem.)\n \n\nTo this, the dialetheist has various replies. Priest has argued that\nthe logical operation of negation should be distinguished from the\nspeech acts of denial and the cognitive state of rejection. So, contra\nFrege, assertion of a negation is not the same as denial. The idea is\nthat exclusion is expressed via a primitive notion\nof rejection: to reject \\(A\\) is to positively refuse to\nbelieve that \\(A\\). That the notion is taken as primitive means, in\nparticular, that it is not reducible to the acceptance of negation: it\nis a sui generis act. The linguistic counterpart of rejection\nis the speech act of denial. Then the dialetheist can rule out that\n\\(A\\) is the case by denying \\(A\\); and this does not amount to the\nassertion of \\(\\neg A\\) (Priest 2006, Ch. 6).  More simply, one can\noften express denials by uttering ordinary language negations:\n‘not’ is, in this sense, pragmatically\nambiguous. We will come back below to how, and why, rejection-denial\nmay not be reducible to the acceptance-assertion of any negation. \nAnother way in which the dialetheist may express the\nexclusion that \\(A\\) is the case is by uttering ‘\\(A \\rightarrow \\bot\\)’, where again \\(\\bot\\) is \n‘Everything is true’. \nSimilarly, a dialetheist may try to fix that \\(A\\) is consistent by saying\n‘if \\(A\\) is both true and false, then \\(\\bot\\)’.\nConsiderations by e.g. Field (2008, Ch. 27), Murzi and Carrara (2013), and Berto (2014), however, cast doubt on whether ‘arrow-falsum’ can work as a dialetheic exclusion-expressing device in all cases. One reason is due to side-effects of the\naforementioned Curry paradox. Another is that ‘arrow-falsum’ is very strong; a mundane sentence like ‘Alice had spaghetti for dinner’ may be false-only (she didn’t), but if it were true too, that wouldn’t be absurd.\nCf. Beall 2013, proposing exclusion via non-logical, theory-specific rules of the form \\(A,\\neg A \\vdash \\bot\\) for each sentence \\(A\\) we take to be consistent; Scharp 2018 suggests possible problems for this approach.\n The exclusion problem gets its strength from some background assumptions. Specifically, it seems to presuppose that the content of a proposition is given in terms of splitting all possible situations, or worlds, into those where the proposition holds and those where it does not. Even accepting this presupposition, though, would\nnot affect a dialetheic challenge to the LNC. For a given \\(A\\) to\nbe a dialetheia, putting things in these terms, it is sufficient that\nthere be overlap between the worlds where \\(A\\) holds, and those\nwhere its negation holds. And this is compatible with the idea of\npropositional content as splitting the totality of worlds—but now with overlap.\nThe tenability of such an overlap, though, requires discussing the account of negation from classical logic, to which we now turn. \n\nArguments against dialetheism are often focused on the concept of logical negation. The main one\ngoes as follows. The truth conditions for negation are:\n\\(\\neg A\\) is true iff \\(A\\) is not true. Hence,\nif \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) were true, \\(A\\) would be both true and not true, which is impossible. \n\n\nWhat to make of this argument? First, the truth conditions\nfor negation employed here are contentious. An alternative view has it\nthat \\(\\neg A\\) is true iff \\(A\\) is false, and\n\\(\\neg A\\) is false iff \\(A\\) is true—and in the\nsemantics of many paraconsistent logics (for instance, the logic of\nFirst Degree Entailment), truth and falsity may overlap. Such an\naccount preserves our intuition that negation is the operator which\n(truth-functionally) switches truth and falsity. It also preserves our\nintuition on contradictoriness, in the form: \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare contradictories iff, if \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\) is false,\nand if \\(A\\) is false, \\(B\\) is true. What has to go, on this proposal, is\nthe assumption that truth and falsity are exclusive\nin all cases: there exist dialetheias, that is, sentences falling\nsimultaneously under both categories. \n\nSecondly, a dialetheist can point out that the argument against dialetheism based\non the truth conditions for (classical) negation begs\nthe question at its last step: why should we assume that it is\nimpossible for \\(A\\) to be both true and not true? Well, because\nit is a contradiction. But that is precisely what is at issue; the critic was supposed to be arguing for the\nimpossibility of any contradiction holding to begin with. In fact, the\ndialetheist may even accept a characterisation of the truth\nconditions for negation as: ‘\\(\\neg A\\) is true\niff \\(A\\) is not true’. For if the\n‘metalanguage’ in which the characterisation is expressed\ncan be inconsistent in its turn, as a thoroughgoing dialetheist is\nlikely to allow (as in Weber et al 2016), then there is no guarantee that the ‘not’\nin that clause behaves consistently. \nSo the debate comes back to the basic question of whether or not consistency can be presupposed. \nA variant on the anti-dialetheic argument from negation comes from a\nQuinean conception of logical vocabulary. It goes as follows. Even\ngranting that there is an operator, say, \\(*\\), which behaves as\ndialetheists claim (namely, such that in particular in some\ncases \\(A\\) is true together with \\(*A)\\), it is still\nperfectly possible to define a negation with all the\nproperties of classical negation; in particular, the property of being\nexplosive. And since classical negation is the standard operator in\nlogic, it is misleading to translate anything non-classical as\n‘not’: such a translation risks simply calling\n‘negation’ something different. A change in logical\nvocabulary is a “change of subject”, as the Quinean slogan\ngoes. A version of this objection to dialetheism is due to Slater (1995); see also Restall 1993. \nOne line of reply to the Quinean objection available to the dialetheist is that the objection is confused between a logical theory and what the theory is a theory\nof. There are many different and well-worked out logical theories of\nnegation (minimal negation, intuitionistic negation, De Morgan\nnegation, etc.). Insofar as each one of them characterizes its own\ntheoretical object, there is no rivalry between logics. Rivalry begins\nwhen we wonder whether some account or other captures the meaning and\nfunctioning of negation as it is used in the vernacular. An applied\naccount of negation is a theory of something, and the\ntheoretical object has to fit the real object. Now, to assume\nbeforehand that the classical account of negation is the\ncorrect one, in the sense that it captures how negation works in the\nvernacular, again begs the question against the dialetheist (and,\nindeed, against most non-classical logicians): it is circular\njust to assume that classical negation gets it right. People\nwho propose a treatment of negation alternative to the\nclassical one are not thereby proposing to\nrevise negation, but to revise an account of it, which they consider incorrect. \nIf it is agreed that a fair discussion between dialetheists and non-dialetheists cannot presuppose one account of negation over the other, then this suggests a simpler reply from dialetheists to the just-true/exclusion problems from 4.2 above. The reply now is to demur from the presuppositions of the just-true/exclusion objections. Without begging any questions one way or the other, this reply goes, all agree that for a sentence to be just-true amounts to it being true and not false, and just-false being false and not true. Then as Priest puts it (Priest 1987, p.291 of 2006 edition), \nIn the exclusion objection, it appears that the dialetheist is being\nasked to ensure that the words she utters behave\nconsistently—which is exactly what is at issue. (See Restall\n2010 and the reply in Beall et al 2011 for one round of this sort of\ndiscussion.) A dialetheist goes on to question why one should think\nthat commitment to an explosive logic is, in itself, a guard against\ncontradiction, and therefore why dialetheists are supposed to be in\nspecial difficulty with respect to the exclusion question any more\nthan a non-dialetheist.  Filling in the details here will vary, but\nthe reply, in short, is for a dialetheist as with anyone else,\n‘just-true’ is just ‘true’ (Beall 2009,\np. 54).\n  One final way this same sort of objection is expressed is by\nasking dialetheists for some way to sort the true-only sentences from\nthe true-and-false sentences: \nPriest’s suggestion is that dialetheists are working with truth and falsity, just like non-dialetheists. Accounts of negation differ, but this on its own does not create any special obligations on the part of dialetheists.  \n\nSome have felt that what is wrong with dialetheism is not so much\nviolation of the LNC itself, as that an acceptance of the LNC is a\nprecondition for rationality. For example, it is often suggested that\nit could not possibly be rational to accept a contradiction. \n\nIt is a matter of ongoing debate what the conditions are under which it is rational to\naccept something. Nevertheless, it is commonly agreed that, as Hume\nput it, the wise person “proportions his beliefs to the\nevidence” (1955, p. 118). If this is right, then if a sufficient case can be\nmade out for a contradiction, it will be rational to believe it. And\nsometimes this does seem possible. We have seen that a seemingly\ncompelling argument can be made in favour of the truth of the\nstrengthened Liar sentence, ‘This sentence is not\ntrue’. Whether or not one takes the argument in question to be\ncompletely persuasive, it suggests that there is nothing in principle\nimpossible about the existence of good arguments for true\ncontradictions. Of course, if there were conclusive evidence for the\nLNC, then no case for a contradiction could be strong enough. But\nconclusive evidence for any philosophical position is difficult to\nachieve. \n\nA more persuasive worry about dialetheism, relating to rationality,\nis the claim that if a person could legitimately accept a\ncontradiction, then no one could be forced, rationally, to\nabandon any view held. For if a person accepts \\(A\\) then,\nwhen an argument for \\(\\neg A\\) is put up, they could simply\naccept both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\). \n\nA dialetheist can reply that, again, not all contradictions are equal. Each sentence, including each contradiction, is evaluated on its merits. While a case can \nbe made for the claim that the Liar sentence is both true and false,\nbut this in no way shows that a case can also be made for Brisbane\nbeing and not being in Australia. (Of course, if one subscribes to the\nclaim that entailment is explosive, a case for one contradiction is a\ncase for all; but if entailment is paraconsistent, this argument is of\nno use.) \n \nAs orthodox philosophy of science indicates, there are, in\nfact, many different considerations that speak for or against the\nrational acceptability of a theory or a view. Among the epistemic\nvirtues of a theory are: its adequacy to the data; its simplicity,\ncleanness and elegance; its unity and freedom from ad hoc\nhypotheses; its explanatory and predictive power; etc. Not only do\nthese (and other) criteria come in degrees, but they may also be\northogonal to each other. In the end, the rational evaluation of a\nview must balance it against all criteria of this kind (of which,\nconsistency is, arguably, one), each, on its own, being defeasible.\n \nDialetheism asks us to consider the possibility that a theory lacking the virtue of\nconsistency may still overcomes its rivals in all or most of the other respects.\nAccording to dialetheists, this is actually the case with the\ndialetheic account of the semantics of ordinary language, whose \nadvantages with respect to consistent accounts have already been\nshortly suggested above. And conversely, of course, an inconsistent theory may\nwell be trumped by a consistent theory, all things considered. So it\nmay be rational to reject an inconsistent position, even if it is\nlogically possible that it is true.\nRationality considerations are dealt with at length in Priest 2006.\n \n\nIf some contradictions are true, it is natural to expect that a dialetheist will\nsometimes accept, or believe in, contradictions, and assert them.\nPriest (2006, p. 109) adopts the following Rationality Principle: \n(RP) If you have good evidence for the truth of \\(A\\), you\nought to accept \\(A\\).\n \n\nBelief, acceptance, and assertion have a point: when we\nbelieve and assert, what we aim at is believing and asserting what is\nthe case or, equivalently, the truth. Therefore, the dialetheist will\naccept and, sometimes, assert both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\), if\nshe has evidence that \\(A\\) is a dialetheia. \n\nNotice that this need not entail that the dialetheist both accepts\nand rejects \\(A\\) at the same time. We now come\nback to the issue flagged in Section 4.2, on the irreducibility of\nrejection to negation. That rejecting\n\\(A\\) is tantamount to accepting its negation is a common view,\nfamously endorsed and defended (more precisely in terms of the\ncorresponding speech acts of assertion and denial) by Frege and Peter\nGeach. But dialetheists have argued that this fusion is a confusion (see\nBerto 2008 on this issue). The point can be made independently of the\nissue of dialetheism: a paracompletist may well want to deny \\(A\\), but it would be unfair to\ntake such a denial as equivalent to the assertion of \\(\\neg A\\), since\nif \\(A\\) is truth-valueless, \\(\\neg A\\) is normally\nconsidered truth-valueless, too, not a truth, and so not to be asserted. A dual position can hold for\ndialetheism: given that accepting \\(\\neg A\\) is different from\nrejecting \\(A\\), a dialetheist can do the former and not the\nlatter—exactly when she thinks that \\(A\\) is a\ndialetheia. \nDoes this show that dialetheism is compatible with rationality? The story about assertion and denial, acceptance and rejection has been challenged from several directions. We will just mention a few. \n \nRestall (2015) argues that the the acceptance/rejection issue makes gappy and glutty approaches symmterical: gap theorists cannot assert some true claims about paradoxes, but glut theorists cannot reject some false claims about non-paradoxes; see also Restall 2013, Jenny 2017.\nIn a note by Laura Goodship (1996), she suggests that the proposal of separating denial from assertion of negation runs into problems related, again, to Curry’s paradox. Her proposal is, in effect, that it would be more natural for dialetheists to both accept and reject things after all.\nFocusing on the phenomenon of disagreement in natural language, Ripley (2015a) argues that dialetheists (and paracompleteists) should rejoin classical logicians in taking negation to embed denial, and denial to express disagreement. Ripley proposes that dialetheists simply admit that (1) agreement and disagreement are incompatible (“it’s incoherent to do both”, p. 306), but (2) in some cases, assert and deny the same thing. The result would be what Ripley calls paracoherentism, which (in echo of paraconsistency) would try to allow local incoherence without global incoherence. How this could be done is an open question. Ripley suggests dropping the transitivity of logical consequence. Goodship herself ultimately recommends dropping modus ponens, a proposal that has been dubbed the ‘Goodship project’ (Beall 2015, Omori 2016, Priest 2017).\n \nThere certainly are various other arguments against dialetheism in the\nphilosophical market (see papers in Priest et al. 2004). For example, Zalta (2004, p. 432) argues that preserving “our pretheoretic understanding of what it is to exemplify or instantiate a property” requires us to preserve the LNC. This entry has presented only some of the most immediate issues that arise in objections and replies. \n\nThe modern dialetheic research program has begun to confront itself with some major topics in traditional and\nmainstream philosophy. Among such topics, a prominent one is the\ndebate between\n realists and\n anti-realists\n(for example, idealists and constructivists) in metaphysics. Very\nroughly, to be a realist about entities of some kind is to\nmaintain that such entities objectively exist apart from, and\nantecedently to, anyone’s thought of them; and, therefore, that our\nthoughts, beliefs and theories concerning such entities are made\nobjectively true or objectively false by them, apart from what we\nthink of them (more refined definitions of realism and anti-realism\nare certainly available; but this characterization will suffice for\nour purposes). \n\nIt has been claimed (Priest 2000b, Priest 2006, Ch. 2)\nthat dialetheism is not by itself committed to a specific conception of\ntruth (deflationist, semantic, correspondentist, coherentist,\nconstructivist, etc.). Nevertheless, if we accept even a mild form of\nrealism, the truth of some contradictions entails the existence of\ninconsistent objects and/or states of affairs: those that make the\ncontradictions true (Berto 2007b). One may claim that it makes no\nsense to talk of inconsistent objects, situations, or states of\naffairs. The world is all there, all together: how could some pieces of\nit contradict some other pieces? Consistency and inconsistency\nmight be taken as properties of sentences, or theories (sets of\nsentences closed under logical consequence), or propositions (what\nsentences express), or maybe thoughts, or (sets of) beliefs, etc.\nContradiction (Widerspruch, the Latin contradictio)\nhas to do with discourse (diction, sprechen, dicere).\nThe world, with its non-mental and non-linguistic inhabitants —\narmchairs, trees, people—is not the right kind of\nthing that can be consistent or inconsistent, and ascribing such\nproperties to (a part of) the world is, to use Gilbert Ryle’s\nterminology, a category mistake. \n\nThese considerations might drive dialetheism towards an anti-realist\ninterpretation of the claim that there are dialetheias, true\ncontradictions; and anti-realist dialetheic theories of truth have, in\nfact, been proposed (see e.g. Beall’s ‘constructive\nmethodological deflationism’, in Beall 2004). But other options\nare available to a dialetheist who wants to embrace some form of\nmetaphysically robust realism about truth. For instance, she can\nstress that consistency and inconsistency can be ascribed to (pieces\nof) the world in a derived sense: to say that the world is\n(locally) inconsistent just is to say that some true purely\ndescriptive sentences about the world have true\nnegations. Consequently, and not accidentally, it is quite common in\nthe current literature both for and against dialetheism to\nstraightforwardly speak of inconsistent objects, states of affairs,\nand entire inconsistent worlds. A dialetheic correspondence theory of\ntruth might be committed, in particular, to negative facts (requiring\nthe simultaneous existence of truth-makers both for \\(A\\) and for\nits negation, when \\(A\\) is a dialetheia); but these may be not\ntoo difficult to handle (see e.g. Priest 2006, pp. 51–3). \n\nThere may also be room for a further intermediate position, that is to\nsay, a ‘semantic dialetheism’ which accepts true\ncontradictions without inconsistent objects or states of affairs as\ntheir truth-makers. This position has been explored in the literature (Kroon 2004, Mares 2004). Beall’s\nview, expressed in his transparent truth theory in Beall 2009, may\nalso be seen as a form of semantic dialetheism. Transparency can be\nnaturally paired with a \n deflationary view of truth. \nFor suppose the truth predicate is a merely semantic device, coined,\nas Quine famously stressed, for expressive,\n‘disquotational’ purposes. Then dialetheias such as the\nLiar(s) may well be semantic side-effects (‘spandrels’, in\nBeall’s terminology) of the introduction of such device, not involving\nany metaphysically committing contradiction in a language- and mind-\nindependent world. Woodbridge and Armour-Garb (2013) argue that a deflationary view of truth is best understood in terms\nof semantic pretense (a hermeneutic fictionalist perspective), and on\nthat basis offered a pretense account of the semantic paradoxes. \n\nDebates on realism and anti-realism quickly spill\nover into questions concerning the nature of reality in general, that\nis, into metaphysical issues: if reality is dialetheic, how should the\nontology of a dialetheic world be spelt out? If metaphysics\nshould be placed (once again) at the very core of philosophy, the\ndebate on the possibility of dialetheias occupies a central place in\nthe core. This was, after all, Aristotle’s view, too: he decided to\nspeak on behalf of the unconditional validity of the LNC, not in his\nOrganon (his writings on the subject of logic), but in the\nMetaphysics, for this was for him an issue to be addressed\nontologically, not (only) via formal logical tools. The most detailed work to date in dialetheic metaphysics is probably Priest 2014, which grounds the very unity of objects in an inconsistent theory of parthood and boundary, and applies it to classical issues in metaphysics, such as the One and the Many, and the instantiation of universals. \n\nSince Aristotle, the assumption that consistency is a requirement for truth, validity, meaning, and rationality, has gone largely unchallenged. Modern\ninvestigations into dialetheism, in pressing the possibility of inconsistent theories that are nevertheless meaningful, valid, rational, and true, call that assumption into question. \nIf consistency does turn out to be a necessary condition for any of\nthese notions, dialetheism prompts us to articulate why; just by pushing philosophers to find arguments for what previously were undisputed beliefs renders a valuable service (Scharp 2007, p. 544).\nAnd if consistency turns out not to be an essential requirement for all theories, then the way is\nopen for the rational exploration of areas in philosophy and the sciences that have traditionally been closed\noff.\n\n","contact.mail":"zach.weber@otago.ac.nz","contact.domain":"otago.ac.nz"}]
