There are also interesting conceptual\nquestions as to how to distinguish revolution from resistance,\nrebellion, and secession, all of which also involve opposition to\nexisting political authority. Unfortunately, the recent renaissance in\njust war theorizing focuses implicitly on interstate wars and thus has\nlargely ignored the morality of revolution, at least as a topic worthy\nof systematic theorizing in its own\n right.[1]\n Recent work on the morality of asymmetrical warfare, on terrorism,\nand on humanitarian military intervention provides valuable resources\nfor constructing a theory of the morality of revolution, but until the\nappearance of Christopher Finlay’s book, Terrorism and the\nRight to Resist: A Theory of Just Revolutionary War (2015),\nnothing approaching a systematic account of the morality of revolution\nhas been\n available.[2]\n In other words, moral theorizing relevant to revolution has been\nrather fragmentary and adventitious, because it has mainly occurred in\nthe pursuit of other topics rather than as part of an inquiry directed\nsquarely at the phenomenon of revolution. Furthermore, although\nprominent figures in the history of Philosophy have held views on\nrevolution, they have primarily concentrated on the issue of just\ncause (and in some cases on rightful authority to wage revolutionary\nwar), without addressing a number of other moral problems that\nrevolutions raise, such as the question of whether revolutionaries can\nrightly use forms of violence that the armed forces of states are\nmorally prohibited from using and whether they may conscript fighters,\npunish defectors and traitors, and expropriate property needed for the\nstruggle. There are hopeful signs, however, that moral theorists will\nsoon give revolution the attention it deserves.\n\n\nThe plan of this entry is as follows.\n Section 1\n discusses conceptual issues, distinguishing between different\nunderstandings of revolution and between violent and nonviolent\nrevolution; it also distinguishes revolution from resistance,\nrebellion and secession. Because violent revolution poses the most\nserious and difficult moral issues, it will be the focus of the\nremainder of the entry. The morality of nonviolent resistance to\npolitical authority is itself sufficiently distinctive, significant\nand complex to warrant a separate entry.\n\n\n\n Section 2\n outlines in broad relief some of the major historical views on the\nmorality of revolution and demonstrates how far short of a\ncomprehensive account of just revolutionary war they fall.\n Section 3\n lays out seven morally relevant differences between revolutionary\nwars and interstate wars that a theory of just revolutionary war\nshould heed.\n Section 4\n is structured by the traditional just war theory division between\njus ad bellum (the just initiation of war) and jus in\nbello (the just conduct of war). With respect to the former, it\nis argued that it is necessary to distinguish different moral issues\nfaced by different parties: the aspiring revolutionary leadership who\ntake it upon themselves to initiate revolutionary war and ordinary\nindividuals who are faced with the decision whether to join the\nrevolutionary struggle or not. This section, drawing on the\ndistinctive features of revolutionary wars set out in the preceding\nsection, identifies the special moral issues faced by the aspiring\nrevolutionary leadership, showing that the actions they must undertake\nto have a good prospect of succeeding in war against the most\noppressive regimes are extremely morally problematic. It also shows\nthat these particular moral problems are obscured by mainstream just\nwar theory’s focus on war between states—in other words,\nbetween entities that already have recognized leadership for war, are\nalready able to mobilize effective armed forces, and that have\nlegitimate political institutions or at least have access to resources\nfor constructing legitimacy. The aspiring revolutionary leadership, in\ncontrast, must struggle to achieve acknowledgment of its leadership in\nthe face of rival claimants to leadership, must mobilize forces for\nwar in spite of the regime’s imposition of extreme costs for\nparticipation in revolution, must “punish” traitors and\ninformants, and yet typically lacks opportunities for establishing its\nlegitimacy with regard to the undertaking of any of these tasks. This\nsection emphasizes the difficulty of satisfying the requirement of\n“rightful authority” for waging war in the case of\nrevolutionary wars. Also included here are critical discussions of\ncompeting views on two issues central to just revolutionary war\ntheory: whether revolutionary warriors may use tactics and strategies\nprohibited to combatants in interstate wars and whether revolutionary\nwar to overthrow “lesser tyrannies”, regimes that violate\ncivil and political rights but do not inflict killings, maimings, or\nenslavement on their peoples, is justifiable.\n\n\nThe\n Conclusion\n emphasizes some of the major results of the investigation and\nsuggests two further topics that a comprehensive theory of just\nrevolutionary war should address: the morality of intervention in\nrevolution and how it is shaped by the morality of revolution; and the\nmoral assessment of the international Law of Armed Conflict’s\nasymmetric treatment of the rights of combatants fighting on behalf of\nstates and revolutionary fighters.\n\n\nAt present, no set of competing theories of the morality of revolution\nis currently available for critical comparison. Consequently, the\nemphasis will be more on laying out the problems such theories should\naddress, rather than on setting out all of the alternatives for\naddressing them. \n\n\n\n\nSeveral terms are used to denote extra-constitutional rejection of an\nexisting government’s authority, either tout court or\nin some particular domain: resistance, rebellion,\n secession[3],\n revolution. Resistance need not be total; it can instead involve\ndisobeying some particular law or laws or efforts to thwart a\ngovernment’s policies or the government’s attempt to\nperform particular actions; and resistance can take a number of forms,\nincluding acts of disobedience that are not only public but designed\nto achieve maximal publicity (as in the case of civil disobedience),\nas well as covert acts of noncompliance; and it may also be either\npeaceful or nonviolent and disruptive or not. Rebellion, usefully\ndistinguished from resistance, involves a wholesale rejection of\ngovernment’s authority. But such a rejection of governmental\nauthority could be undertaken for quite different reasons, whether to\ndo away with government altogether (the anarchist’s\n goal)[4],\n to establish a new government with the same domain of territorial\nauthority, to create a new territorial unit out of part of the\nterritory of the existing government (secession), or to sever part of\nthe territory of the government and join it to another existing state\n(irredentist secession). Revolution is commonly understood to have two\ncomponents: rejection of the existing government’s authority and\nan attempt to replace it with another government, where both involve\nthe use of extra-constitutional means. On this reading, revolution and\nrebellion share a negative aim, the wholesale rejection of a\ngovernment’s authority, but revolution includes in addition a\npositive aim, to institute a new government in place of the one it has\ndestroyed. \nSome important empirical work relevant to the morality of\nrevolutionary war is to be found in studies of civil war. The latter\nis sometimes defined as a large scale armed conflict between state\nforces and one or more nonstate parties. This definition may be too\nrestrictive, however, since it would exclude a large-scale armed\nconflict between two or more nonstate parties under conditions in\nwhich the government had disintegrated entirely or still existed but\nwas not capable of fielding forces. A broader understanding of civil\nwar that would encompass that kind of case would be simply that of a\nlarge-scale intrastate armed conflict.  \nThe preceding terms are not always sorted out in this way in actual\npolitical discourse. For example, the government of the United States\nlabeled the secession of the Southern states from the Union as a\nrebellion, while many Confederates called their enterprise the Second\nAmerican Revolution; and the American colonists who strove to secede\nfrom the British Empire tended to call themselves revolutionaries, not\nsecessionists or rebels. (It may be that the Americans avoided the\nterm “rebel” because they thought it had negative\nconnotations). Similarly, the Algerian secession from France is often\nreferred to as the Algerian Revolution and wars of colonial liberation\nare rarely called secessionist conflicts, though their goal is\nsecession from a political order centered on a metropolitan\n state.[5]\n In what follows, the term “revolution” will be reserved\nfor extra-constitutional attempts to destroy an existing national\ngovernment and replace it, to the full extent of its territorial\nauthority, with a new government. On this way of sorting out the\nvarious terms, secessionists and revolutionaries are necessarily\nrebels, while rebels need be neither secessionists nor revolutionaries\n(they may be anarchists), and secessionists, as such are not\nrevolutionaries. \nSometimes the term “revolution” is used in a stronger\nsense, as denoting not just an extra-constitutional attempt to replace\none government with another, but also to effect a fundamental change\nin the type of government, as in a revolution to overthrow an\nautocracy and create in its stead a democracy. Thus some scholars on\nthe Left have contended that the so-called American Revolution was not\nreally a revolution, because it did not create or even aim at anything\nother than a new form of the bourgeois state—a state controlled\nby and in the interest of the class that controls the means of\nproduction (Zinn 1980, Jennings 2000). Many American historians have\nconcluded otherwise, asserting that it was a revolution in the\nstronger sense because it replaced a monarchy with a republic (Nash\n2005; Wood 1993). On this stronger understanding of revolution as\ninvolving a fundamental change in the type of government,\nsecessionists would also be revolutionaries, if the new government\nthey attempt to establish in part of the territory of the state would\nbe of a fundamentally different type. Obviously, this stronger\nconception of revolution is no clearer and less contentious than\nattempts to distinguish fundamentally different types of government\n(hence the debate over whether the war for the independence of the\nAmerican Colonies from Britain was “really” a revolution).\nFor the remainder of the discussion I will use\n“revolution” in the weaker sense, with the understanding\nthat it can also encompasses revolutions in the stronger sense. It is\nworth noting, however, that the morality of revolution in the stronger\nsense is, if anything, more complex than that of the weaker sense,\nbecause the former involves not only the extra-constitutional\noverthrow of the existing government but also the extra-constitutional\nestablishment of a new type of government.  \nOne more distinction is needed. Revolutions may be violent or\nnonviolent and may begin nonviolently and become violent. This\ndistinction, though obviously important, is not so crisp as one might\nthink, because what counts as violence may be disputed. For example,\nattempts to overthrow a government by disruptive techniques (for\nexample conducting general strikes, disabling power grids, or blocking\nmain transportation routes) are not violent in the way in which\ndischarging firearms or detonating explosives is, but they may\nnonetheless cause lethal harms. The chief topic of this entry is\nviolent revolution where “violence” is understood in the\nmost robust way and as occurring on a large scale; in other words, the\ntopic is revolutionary war as “war” is usually understood\n(Singer & Small 1994: 5).  \nIt is well worth noting, however, that there is a position on\nrevolution that obviates the need for a theory of just revolutionary\nwar, namely, the view that large-scale revolutionary violence is never\nmorally justified because the risks of such an endeavor are so great\nand because nonviolent revolution is more efficacious. Some empirical\npolitical scientists have argued that there is good evidence that\nnonviolent revolution is more likely to achieve its ends than\nrevolutionary war (Chenoweth & Stephan\n 2011).[6]\n Even if that is true as a generalization, the question remains as to\nwhether there are exceptions—cases where nonviolence is not\nlikely to achieve the aims of just revolution or would only achieve\nthem with undue costs in terms of human well-being—and whether\nthey can be identified ex ante.  If there are any such cases,\nthere is a need for a theory of just revolutionary war. \nNo attempt can be made here to conduct a survey of views on revolution\nacross the history of Western Philosophy, much less one that\nencompasses other traditions. Instead, it must suffice to say that the\ntypical attitude toward revolution of major figures in the Western\ntradition prior to the modern period was to condemn it or to\nacknowledge its moral permissibility only in very narrow circumstances\n(Morkevicius 2014). Augustine (City of God) and Aquinas\n(Summa theologiae), for example, both condemn rebellion and\nhence revolution, unambiguously urging obedience to the powers that\nbe. Suárez (1609) held that only “lesser\nmagistrates” had the authority to try to overthrow an existing\ngovernment, with the implication that revolution by those who do not\nalready occupy official roles was never justified.  Hobbes (1651),\nwhom some consider the first truly modern political philosopher in the\nWestern tradition, explicitly denied that revolution could ever be\njustified, holding instead that a subject could only rightly resist\ngovernment authority as a matter of self-defense and then only when\nthe perpetration of lethal harm against her was imminent. \nViews that reject revolution outright or hold it to be permissible in\nonly the most extreme of circumstances typically have either or both\nof two rationales. The first is an overriding aversion to the\nperceived risk of violent anarchy posed by attempts to overthrow a\ngovernment (the Undue Risk Argument). The second is the conviction\nthat the requirement of rightful authority cannot, as a matter of\nlogical necessity, be met in the case of revolutionary war (The\nConceptual Argument). \nConsider first the Undue Risk Argument for the conclusion that\nrevolution is never or only rarely justified. Put most simply, the\nidea here is that virtually any government is better than none and\nthat while it is true that revolutions (as opposed to mere rebellions)\naim not merely to destroy existing government but to replace it with\nsomething better, they may succeed only in the first, destructive\ntask, or not succeed in the second, constructive task until an\nunacceptable decrement in physical security has occurred. Such views\nhave often been grounded in a rather pessimistic view of human nature.\nWhile some Medieval thinkers may have attributed the risk of extreme\nviolence when government authority is rejected to man’s\nsupposedly irrational and selfish nature, Hobbes (1651) in contrast\ncan be interpreted as attributing it to human rationality, without any\nassumption that all or even most human beings are bloody-minded or\nsubject to overweening desires for domination. On this interpretation\nof Hobbes, where there is no government—no power capable of\nenforcing rules conducive to physical security—it is rational\nfor individuals to try to dominate others for purely defensive\nreasons, even if there is only a minority of individuals who seek\ndomination for its own sake. It is not man’s sinful nature, but\nhis rationality, combined with the game-theoretic structure of the\ncondition of anarchy, that makes lack of government so lethally\ndangerous. \nAt least in the classical liberal tradition, according to which\nindividuals have rights prior to the institution of government and in\nwhich governments are viewed as trustees, agents of the people, the\nattitude toward revolution is generally more permissive. There is a\nright to revolt when government violates those natural rights for the\nprotection of which it was created. Locke (1689) apparently goes\nfurther: on one interpretation, he holds that the people at its own\ndiscretion may rightly revoke the trusteeship, that is, dissolve the\ngovernment, even in the absence of the state’s violation of\nnatural rights or failure to protect them. They could, for example,\ndissolve the government in order to form a new one that they simply\nthought was more efficient. Locke apparently attempts to dull the edge\nof this rather radical conclusion by assuming, quite gratuitously,\nthat revolution will not occur unless the people as a whole have\nalready suffered greatly at the hands of the government. He might also\nhave thought that in cases where the present government was not\nviolating natural rights, dissolving it was only permissible if done\nthrough a constitutionally sanctioned process, not through\nrevolution. \nLocke does not explicitly consider two possibilities that have\nfrequently been realized in actual revolutionary circumstances: first,\nthat governmental oppression may not be universal but instead may\ntarget only certain groups within society, for example, religious or\nethnic or national minorities or those who criticize government;\nsecond, that even if there is general oppression there may not be a\nsufficient spontaneous mobilization of forces to overthrow the\ngovernment. Consequently, Locke conveniently sidesteps two questions\nthat a theory of the morality of revolution ought to address: (1)\nwhether revolution to end special as opposed to general oppression is\njustifiable; and (2) what means may those already committed to\nrevolution employ to mobilize enough others to participate in\nrevolution to make success possible. The first question is significant\nbecause of the possibility that the harm to innocent\npeople—including a general decrease in physical\nsecurity—that revolution may entail, has somehow to be weighed\nagainst the benefit in terms of relief from injustice that the\noppressed minority will get if the revolution ultimately succeeds.\nEven if the injustices done to the minority ought to be given greater\nweight in the balancing exercise, there may come a point at which\nrevolution fails a proportionality test if the harms to others that\nwill result from remedying minority rights-violations are great\nenough. The second question arises because even where oppression is\ngeneral there may not be sufficiently widespread participation in\nrevolution to achieve success, either because significant portions of\nthe population, in the grip of an ideology that purports to justify\nthe existing political order, do not see themselves as seriously\noppressed, or because of the failure to solve collective action\nproblems. If either of these two conditions obtain, mobilizing enough\npeople to have a good chance of successful revolution may require\ncoercion under conditions in which those who would wield it lack\nlegitimacy and in which the institutional resources that could confer\nlegitimacy are unavailable.  \nLocke took a more favorable stance toward revolution than Hobbes or\nhis medieval predecessors, because he did not believe that the risks\nof physical insecurity attendant upon the destruction of an existing\ngovernment were as high as those thinkers did. That more optimistic\nview as grounded, in turn, in his belief that the destruction of the\npolitical order need not entail the destruction of society—that\nis, of social practices and habits that effectively control the most\nserious forms of violence. It is a mistake, however, to conclude\neither that Hobbes was right and Locke was wrong or vice\nversa about the consequences for physical security of the\ndestruction of government. A generalization either way would be\nunhelpful. A more reasonable view is that the risks of the destruction\nof government and hence of revolution vary, depending upon the\ncircumstances. If that is so, and if the justifiability of revolution\ndepends even in part on the severity of the risks of physical\ninsecurity it involves, then it appears that the content of a theory\nof just revolutionary war must be shaped by empirical considerations.\nYet it is fair to say that many philosophers who have had something to\nsay about just revolutionary war, whether explicitly or by implication\nin their work on interstate wars, have not taken this point to heart.\nThey have either not understood the importance of empirical\nassumptions about the risks of revolution or made the relevant\nempirical assumptions but without supplying sufficient evidence for\ntheir validity. Without a well-evidenced empirical account of the\nconditions under which attempts to overthrow the government are likely\nto cause violent anarchy, and an account of the conditions under which\nviolent anarchy is likely to continue for some significant period of\ntime, both pessimism and optimism about revolution, and the\ncalculations of proportionality on which the justification for\nrevolution is supposed to depend, will be more a matter of faith than\nreason. \nThe second or conceptual argument or denying that revolution is\njustifiable is attributed to Kant on what might be called the\nRousseauian interpretation of his view, as articulated perhaps most\nclearly by Christine Korsgaard (2008) and Katrin Flikschuh (2008). (1)\nto be justified, an attempt to overthrow the existing political\nauthority would have to be an expression of, or authorized by, the\ngeneral will; otherwise it would be the imposition of a private will\nor private wills and hence contrary to right; (2) but only the\nexisting supreme political authority can express or be the authorized\nagent of the general will; therefore (3) revolution can never be\njustified. This argument against revolution, unlike Hobbesian-style\nundue risk arguments, does not rely upon unsupported empirical\nassumptions about the uniformly dire consequences for physical\ninsecurity of attempts to destroy existing governments. It is\nvulnerable, however, to a different objection, namely, that when\ngovernment is sufficiently tyrannical and destructive, the lesser of\nevils may be for someone to act without possessing authority—in\nother words, that the use of coercion, if it is necessary to achieve\nthe conditions for basic justice and involves the minimal amount of\ncoercion needed to accomplish that, can be morally justified even if\nit is not wielded by an agent that possesses legitimacy (Buchanan\n2013, 2016). Framed in Kantian terms, this is the view that in extreme\ncases the imposition of the basic order needed for the realization of\nrights can be justified even if it is the imposition of a private\nwill, so long as the object of that will is the common good of justice\nproperly conceived, so long as the coercion employed is the least\nneeded to do the job, and so long as the agent undertaking to create\norder is likely to be capable of succeeding in doing so. \nThe conceptual version of Kant’s denial that revolution can be\njustified is distinct from a different Kantian argument that is more\nakin to the Undue Risk Argument: (i) all human beings are indefeasibly\nobligated to contribute to getting out of and staying out of a\ncondition in which universal right cannot be realized, (ii) universal\nright can only be realized where government exists and is recognized\nas authoritative, (iii) to revolt is both to try to destroy the\nexisting government and to deny its authority, and therefore (iv)\nrevolution can never be justified. This second interpretation of\nKant’s view holds that to engage in revolution is not just to\ncreate an unacceptably high risk of general insecurity but also to\nviolate a fundamental obligation to contribute to the conditions for\nthe realization of universal right. In more contemporary terms, it is\nan argument against revolution based on a strong interpretation of the\nNatural Duty of Justice, the obligation to help bring about and\nsustain the conditions for justice.  \nThe Natural Duty Argument is vulnerable to an obvious objection: If\nthe existing government is so awful as to thwart even a decent\napproximation of the realization of universal right, and if revolution\npresents a better prospect for doing so, then the moral obligation to\ncreate the conditions for the realization of universal right speaks in\nfavor of revolution, not against it (Finlay 2015: 19–52). \nWhereas liberal political philosophers have tended to frame the\njustification or revolution in terms of remedying government’s\nviolation of natural rights or its failure to acknowledge the\npeople’s revocation of its trusteeship (for example by rejecting\nthe results of an election), revolution in the Marxist tradition is\nunderstood quite differently. There is one strain of Marx\ninterpretation according to which he rejects rights-talks altogether,\neither in favor of the discourse of conflicting interests or in favor\nof the vocabulary of self-realization or mankind’s overcoming of\nalienation from its “species being” (Buchanan 1982). On\nthis interpretation, Marx held that the very concept of rights is an\nideological construct that is fostered by and in turn reinforces the\negoistic psychology of bourgeois society and will be discarded once\nthe transition to developed communist society occurs. If the very\nconcept of rights is thus both tainted and fated for obsolescence,\nthen the question arises as to how else the justification for\nproletarian revolution might be framed (Finlay 2006). One answer that\nis consistent at least with the early writings of Marx is that\nproletarian revolution is needed to destroy the conditions of\nalienation and create the conditions for the full realization of\nman’s nature as a creative, communal being, the sort of being\nwho will, through processes of scientifically informed collective\ndecision-making, bring the natural and social world fully under\ndeliberate human control for the good of all (Economic &\nPhilosophical Manuscripts of 1844, in MER:\n66–125). \nEven if Marx thought that successful revolution could be correctly\ndescribed as the overcoming of alienation or more positively as the\nrealization of human “species being”, it is doubtful that\nhe thought that proletarian revolution needed to be justified\nin this or any other way. There is, after all, a Marx who derides\n“moralistic” socialists and who seems to hold that\nsuccessful proletarian revolution is a matter of the historically\ninevitable realization of the common interests of the proletariat, and\nthat the revolution will be effectively motivated by those interests,\nnot by a commitment to any moral principle (On the Division of\nLabor in Production in MER: 683–717). Such an\ninterpretation fits well with Marx’s understanding of his theory\nof history as scientific and realistic.  According to this account,\nthe question of whether revolution is justified is idle; it will\noccur, because the revolution in the mode of production that marks the\ntransition from capitalism to communism will produce a fundamental\ntransformation of all social relationships that will carry human\nbeings beyond the state and beyond politics (Critique of the Gotha\nProgramme, Part IV, 1875 in MER: 525–541). Call this\nthe Amoralist interpretation of Marx on revolution. \nTo the extent that the Amoralist interpretation includes an account of\nthe motivation (as opposed to the justification) of proletarian\nrevolution[7],\nit is simple and rationalistic: eventually the workers will realize\nthat overthrow of the capitalist order is in their interests and will\nact accordingly. There are two apparently fatal problems with such a\nview. First, according to Marx’s own thinking, the proletariat\nwill mobilize against the capitalist order only when the capitalism\nhas reached such a pitch of alienation, exploitation, and immiseration\nthat the workers have nothing to lose but their chains\n(Capital, Volume 1, 1894, in MER: 329–343;\nManifesto of the Communist Party, 1848, in MER:\n500). Marx believes that this is bound to occur because the capitalist\nsystem gives every capitalist an overriding incentive to keep\nsqueezing as much labor out of his workers as possible, even if every\ncapitalist reads Capital and can foresee that that the\naggregate effect of such behavior will result in the overthrow of the\nsystem. But this means that Marx assumed that the capitalists as a\nclass were afflicted by a collective action problem they could not\nsolve—that even though it is in their collective interests to\navoid the immiseration of the proletariat, each will find it rational\nto act in a way that will contribute to immiseration. On the contrary,\nit can be argued that the capitalists solved their collective action\nproblem by the creation of the modern welfare state—a device\nthat sufficiently alleviates the plight of the workers to thwart\nmobilization for revolution, but without destroying the dominance of\nthe bourgeoisie. Second, while Marx gives us no good reason to think\nthat the capitalists will succumb to an insoluble collective action\nproblem, he fails to take seriously the collective action problem\nfaced by the proletariat (Cohen 1978, Elster 1985). As with\nrevolutions generally, each individual may reason that either enough\nothers will mobilize to enable a successful revolution or they will\nnot, that her own participation in revolution is likely to come at a\nsignificant cost, that she will reap the benefits of the revolution if\nit succeeds, and that therefore the rational course of action is to\nabstain from participation. The key point here is that the workers\nlack the resource for solving their collective action problem that the\ncapitalists can use to solve theirs: control over the state and hence\naccess to enforcement of rules that can change incentives for\nrefraining from contributing to a public good. Marx not only fails to\ntake the proletariat’s collective action problem seriously; his\ntheory of alienation implies that it will be severe, because one of\nthe effects of capitalism is to turn workers against each other in the\ncompetition for employment and produce among them the egoistic\npsychology typical of all people living under capitalism (Buchanan\n1979). In brief, the Amoralist Marx’s attempt to side-step the\nquestion of whether or under what conditions revolution is morally\njustified fails, because his interest-based account of revolutionary\nmotivation makes the revolution depend upon the immiseration of the\nproletariat, wrongly assumes that the capitalist class will not be\nable to act collectively to avoid immiseration, and wrongly assumes\nthat if the proletariat come to see that their interests require the\noverthrow of the system they will in fact revolt. \nA natural Marxian reply might be to abandon the claim that\ninterest-based motivation is causally sufficient for successful\nproletarian revolution, holding instead that the proletariat can come\nto see that capitalism is incompatible with the dignity of human\nbeings or with the full realization of their potential for harmonious,\ncreative, collective control over the natural and social world and the\nabolition of all forms of exploitation and exploitation. On this view,\nthe motivation for revolution is a kind of perfectionist ethics or,\nmore modestly, a desire to end human degradation. \nThe idea would be that the proletarians only encounter an insoluble\ncollective action problem if each worker (or enough of them) operates\nin the calculating mode, weighing the costs and benefits of\nparticipation, as they decide whether to revolt. One might think that\nit is a distinctive feature of some types of moral motivation that\nthey can lead individuals to escape the calculating mode that produces\ncollective action problems. Not all types of moral motivation would do\nthe trick, of course. If the workers were overall utility-maximizers,\neach might still decide to refrain from revolution, reasoning that\neither enough others will participate to enable the revolution to\nsucceed or they will not, regardless of whether she participates and\nthat her participation would simply be an unnecessary subtraction from\noverall utility. Other kinds of moral motivation, including those that\nare expressions of commitment to deontological principles, might in\ncontrast, preclude the individual from making the calculations that\nproduce the proletariat’s collective action problem. Such\nprinciples can serve as “exclusionary reasons” and what\nthey exclude from consideration is cost-benefit calculations.  \nAbandoning the Amoralist Marxian account of revolution would mean\nignoring the numerous “scientific realist” passages in\nMarx’s writings and ignoring his scorn for moralistic\nsocialists. But there would still remain two problems, one internal to\nthe Marxist view and the other independent of it. The first problem is\nthat it is hard to see, given Marx’s views on ideology, how the\nproletarian masses could, while subject to the consciousness\ndistorting forces of capitalism, come to rally around a perfectionist\nethic or form allegiance to any moral principle that would require the\ncomplete overthrow of capitalism. Marx apparently thought that the\ncurtain of ideology would be torn aside by the immiseration of the\nproletariat—that when they reached the full depths of\ndeprivation and degradation they would come to see that capitalism had\nto go. But Marx was wrong in his prediction that immiseration would\noccur: in most societies under capitalism, real wages have risen and\nthe welfare state has alleviated the plight of the workers--just\nenough. The second problem is that recent empirical work on\nrevolutions indicates that in many cases—perhaps most—what\ndetermines whether an individual will participate in the revolution or\neven support it in any way is whether the regime or the\nrevolutionaries control the area in which the individual lives\n(Kalyvas 2006, Weinstein 2007). If that is so, then it appears that in\nmany cases moral motivation is causally irrelevant; it is the interest\nin avoiding the costs imposed by those who wield coercive power over\nthe individual, whether they be agents of the regime or those already\ncommitted to the revolution, that determines participation or\nnonparticipation in revolution. But if that is so, then the topic of\nthe morality of revolution cannot be avoided, because it will always\nbe appropriate to ask whether those who possess coercive power ought\nto use it and if so how they ought to use it. \nAs was suggested earlier, in many revolutionary contexts the people\nare caught in a destructive strategic interaction between the regime\nand those already committed to revolution, as the regime raises the\ncosts of participation and the revolutionaries raise the cost of\nnonparticipation. Some of the most difficult moral issues concerning\nrevolution pertain to the permissibility of coercive means for solving\nthe revolutionary collective action problem in the context of this\nstrategic interaction.  \nBy way of summary and as a broad generalization, it is fair to say\nthat at least since the time of Locke (1689), the dominant view on\nrevolution in Western Political Philosophy, both in the Liberal and\nMarxist traditions, and perhaps in popular political culture as well,\nhas been considerably more permissive than that of Hobbes (1651) and\nKant (1797) and their medieval predecessors. For the remainder of this\nessay, I will focus on broadly liberal approaches to revolution on the\nassumption that, for the foreseeable future, the development of a\ngenuine theory of just revolutionary war is most likely to develop by\nutilizing the resources of liberal political theory. This strategy is\nperhaps not as restrictive as it might appear, since contemporary\nliberal thought accommodates not just the idea of individual rights,\nbut also that of the collective right of self-determination. That is\nan important qualification, because from the 1950s to the 1970s\nrevolution for many people in non-Western societies meant liberation\nfrom colonial rule; and in some cases liberation was framed more in\nterms of collective self-determination than in terms of the\nvindication of individual rights. One important question a theory of\njust revolutionary war ought to answer is whether the realization of\nthe right of collective self-determination is in itself a just cause\nfor revolutionary war or whether it is only so when collective\nself-determination is the remedy for violations of basic individual\nrights. This issue is addressed in the next section. \nA key question that will arise at a number of points in this\ninvestigation is whether mainstream just war theory, in spite of its\nimplicit focus on interstate wars provides an adequate account of the\nmorality of revolutionary wars. To answer this question, there are at\nleast seven potentially morally significant differences to keep in\nmind. \nFirst, satisfaction of the traditional jus ad bellum\nrequirement of “rightful authority” to make war, as\nsuggested above, is more difficult in the case of revolution,\nespecially at the beginning of the conflict, when an often tiny\nminority undertakes armed struggle against the government and does so\nsupposedly in the name of the people, but where the standard\ninstitutional forms or processes for legitimizing the use of violence\nare unavailable to the revolutionaries. In different terms, the\nproblem is that revolutionaries claim to act on behalf of the people,\nbut under conditions in which it is difficult to see how they could be\nauthorized to do so. Later we will see that attempts to solve this\nproblem by invoking notions of consent, approval, or representation\nare inadequate in many of the circumstances in which revolutions\nactually occur—and ironically, especially under those conditions\nin which the just cause for revolution is most compelling.  \nEven contemporary theorists acknowledge that the problem of rightful\nauthority is especially difficult in the case of the waging of\nrevolutionary war, the discussion is often at too abstract because it\nfails to distinguish between different domains of action in which\nlegitimacy can be an issue. Even if, for example, it can be shown that\na particular group of revolutionaries is the legitimate leadership in\nthe sense that it can be taken to represent the people as a whole and\nrightly act on their behalf, it is a separate question as to whether\nit has the sort of legitimacy required for certain particular\nactivities such as conscripting individuals to fight, using coercion\nto suppress rival claimants for leadership, or “punishing”\ntraitors or informants. \nSecond, in interstate wars there is often only one claimant (on each\nside) to the role of initiating and directing the use of large-scale\nviolence, namely, the state leadership. But in many revolutionary\nwars, at least at the outset and often far into the conflict, two or\nmore parties engaging in revolutionary violence contend with one\nanother (often violently) to be acknowledged, by the people and by\nother states and international organizations, as the sole legitimate\nrevolutionary war-maker. So, one difficult moral issue concerns the\nmeans that rivals for leadership may use in competition with one\nanother. Revolutions frequently are characterized by violent struggles\nfor leadership, under conditions in which no contender for leadership\ncan claim exclusive legitimacy if any legitimacy at all.  \nThird, as already noted, because those who attempt to launch\nrevolutions do not possess standing armies or effective authority to\nraise them, they face a serious collective action problem that\nestablished states have already solved: they must mobilize a\nsufficient portion of the population to make war effectively, in spite\nof the fact that it will often be rational for any given individual to\nrefrain from participating. Any ordinary individual may reason as\nfollows: whether I participate or not has virtually zero probability\nof determining the outcome; but participation is a cost, perhaps an\nextreme cost, to me and perhaps to my family or other close associates\nas well. So, regardless of what others do, the rational thing for me\nto do, whether I consider my own utility narrowly construed or include\nthe utility of those I care most about, is to refrain from\nparticipating. If enough individuals reason in this way, an\ninsufficient number of people will be mobilized to make the revolution\nsucceed. Collective action problems are not always insoluble, of\ncourse. Later we will consider several solutions to what may be called\n“the revolutionary mobilization collective action problem”\n(REMCAP for brevity)—each of which will be shown to raise\nserious moral issues. In other words, it is one thing to say the\nREMCAP can be solved, another to say it can be solved in a morally\nacceptable way. By way of preview, it is worth noting that the REMCAP\nhas a crucial strategic dimension: while the aspiring revolutionary\nleadership will try to overcome the people’s incentives for\nrefraining from participation, whether by providing them with benefits\nconditional on participation or by imposing costs on them for\nnonparticipation, the regime will attempt to counter the effort to\nachieve revolutionary mobilization by providing benefits conditional\non nonparticipation or imposing costs on participation. The resulting\ndynamic takes the game-theoretic structure of an arms race in which\nboth the revolutionary forces and the regime use violence and often\nterrorism against the people (Buchanan 2013). This spiral of strategic\nviolence is not merely a theoretical possibility: some of the leading\nempirical work on revolutions indicates that it is typical of the\nrevolutionary environment. One especially interesting empirical\nfinding is that the best predictor of whether an individual will\nsupport the revolution or the regime is which force controls the space\nthe individual occupies. (Kalyvas 2006: 131–132). Empirical\nstudies document that the cycle of coercion and counter-coercion in\nrevolutionary struggles is ubiquitous (Kalyvas 2006: 10, 12, 215,\n228–229). A just war theory designed for the quite different\nenvironment of interstate wars is not likely to address the moral\nproblems raised by this feature of revolutionary wars.  \nA fourth morally relevant difference between the typical interstate\nwar and revolutionary war is this: in the former, a change in their\nown government is not usually a goal of the contending parties (though\none or both may aim at imposing a new form of government on the\nother). The goal of revolutionary war-makers in contrast is to change\nthe government and on the stronger understanding of\n“revolution” to make a fundamental change in the form or\ncharacter of government. Yet because revolutionaries have repudiated\nor cannot avail themselves of existing political processes for\ndetermining political aims and have not yet developed new processes\nfor performing that task (at least in the earlier stages of the\nstruggle), there may be serious disagreement among revolutionaries as\nto what the goal of the revolution is, with no nonviolent, much less\nlegitimate process for resolving it. Many may agree that the regime\nmust fall, but there may be deep—and violent--disagreements as\nto what should follow. This, too, makes revolution a more morally\nfraught enterprise. Suppose, as was suggested earlier, that revolution\ndiffers from mere rebellion in that the latter is simply a rejection\nof governmental authority while the former involves that plus a\ncommitment to forming a new political order. If that is so, and if\nrevolutionaries lack the institutional resources to determine a common\nunderstanding of what the new political order is to be, then the task\nof evaluating the justness of a revolutionary struggle becomes more\ndifficult. It may be a mistake to say “X is the aim of\nthe revolutionary war-makers” because there may be no one aim\nand the plurality of aims may be mutually inconsistent, with some\nbeing just and others being unjust. It is true, of course that a state\nthat wars with another state will often have more than one war aim and\nmay also have inconsistent aims, but at least in the case of\nreasonably well-functioning states there is an authoritative, that is,\nlegitimacy-conferring process for determining what the aims of the\nconflict are and which are to be given priority if they conflict. \nFifth, if one party to an interstate war loses, this will not usually\ninvolve a complete destruction of its political order or if it does\nthe victor will often quickly impose some order as it gains control\nover the vanquished country’s territory. But revolutionary wars\npresent a greater risk of literal anarchy, with all of the threats to\nhuman rights and well-being that this usually entails, because\nrevolutionaries, even when they succeed in defeating the regime, may\nnot yet have (and in some cases may never develop) the capacity to\nimpose order. In that sense, the stakes are often higher in\nrevolutionary wars and the traditional likelihood of success\nrequirement of just war theory may be harder to satisfy. There are two\nother factors, both of which are present in many violent revolutions,\nthat make the problem of creating a new political order that can\nprovide an acceptable level of physical security especially difficult.\nFirst, revolutionary conflicts, like other intrastate wars, are often\nespecially brutal, because the lines between combatants and\nnoncombatants tend to be blurred, because of the spiral of coercion\nstemming from strategic interaction regarding revolutionary\nmobilization characterized above, and because individuals and groups\noften use the general context of violence to settle private conflicts\nthat have little or no connection to the issues for which revolution\nis supposedly undertaken (Kalyvas 2006: 14). So building a secure\npeace may be hindered by persisting animosity, allegations of\natrocities, and the quest for vengeance, while social capital in the\nform of trust may be in short supply. Second, in the contemporary\ncontext, it is often the case that in societies where the just cause\nfor revolution is most compelling, namely, what could be called\nResolute Severe Tyrannies, there are deep divisions along religious or\nethno-national lines, in large part because the tyrants have fostered\nsuch divisions in order to prevent the people from achieving unified\nopposition to the regime. Where such divisions exist and there is no\nculture of tolerance and power-sharing, the destruction of the\ntyrannical regime may result in violent intergroup conflicts, with no\nindigenous force capable of imposing a peace settlement and building a\ncondition of persisting physical security. Under these conditions, to\nundertake revolution is to unleash forces that may result either in\nviolent anarchy or unwanted foreign intervention undertaken on the\npretext of establishing order. \nSixth, at least under modern conditions, revolutionary wars have the\npotential to persist longer than interstate wars as they have\ntraditionally been conducted, and hence are likely to involve more\nhuman and material destruction other things being equal, because of\ninterventions that serve not to end them but rather to prolong them.\nIt is a feature of contemporary revolutionary wars that they are\nseldom left to the primary parties. Instead, rival states or groups of\nrival states often support different sides. In interstate wars, the\nconflict typically ends when it is clear that there is an indefinitely\npersisting stalemate and hence both sides are compelled to seek a\nnegotiated peace or when one side overwhelms the other (Wittman 1979;\nJones, Bremer & Singer 1996; Wagner 2000). But when revolutions\nbecome proxy wars between rival powers, one state is likely to\nintervene to resupply or otherwise support its proxy to break a\nstalemate or prevent the other side from achieving victor. That is why\nmost empirical theorists of intrastate war predict that there is no\nend in sight to the conflict in Syria (Jenkins 2014). This problem is\nexacerbated by the fact that one or both of the sponsors of the\nconflicting sides may not have as its top strategic aim a victory for\nits side. Instead, the dominant goal may actually be to prolong the\nconflict. To the extent that revolutionaries or regimes who oppose\nthem ought to take the traditional jus ad bellum requirement\nof likelihood of success into account and also ought to heed the\nrequirement of proportionality, their task is complicated by strategic\ndynamic that occurs when revolutions are not simple two party affairs,\nbut proxy contests between other parties as well. Intervention makes\ncalculations of both likelihood of success and proportionality more\nproblematic. And if there is a presumption against war unless\nlikelihood of success and proportionality are relatively certain, then\nit follows that the justification for revolutionary war is even more\nproblematic, other things being equal, than for interstate war. \nSeventh, and finally, entrenched tyrannical regimes, the most morally\ncompelling targets for revolution, typically use their control over\neducation and the media to instill propaganda designed to prevent the\npeople from recognizing just how rotten the regime is, how poorly the\neconomy is performing, how inferior the quality of life is compared\nwith that in better governed countries, and how widespread\ndissatisfaction with the regime actually is. Hence, effective\nrevolutionary action may require the dissipation of false\nconsciousness on the part of the people. The aspiring revolutionary\nleadership thus may be faced with the task of trying to dismantle the\nfalse consciousness of those they hope to enlist in the revolutionary\nstruggle. In actual cases, aspiring leaders have often used violence\nand sometimes terrorism in an effort to overcome the epistemic\nobstacles to widespread participation in revolution. For example, they\nhave attacked “soft targets”—policemen or government\nofficials—to demonstrate to the people that “we\nhave the power to hurt them”. Another tactic often used\nby revolutionaries to overcome epistemic obstacles is to provoke the\nregime to undertake brutal responses to relatively peaceful\ndemonstrations, in order to reveal to all just how ruthless the regime\nis. Such actions, which are condemned by mainstream jus in\nbello thinking, are said to be necessary to instill the sense of\nagency that false consciousness has undermined. The need to overcome\nfalse consciousness or more generally to overcome serious epistemic\nobstacles to revolution, combined with the revolutionary\nleadership’s lack of effective peaceful resources for doing so,\nposes difficult moral choices that are not as frequently encountered\nby the leaders of states in interstate wars. \nFor all of these reasons, revolutionary wars tend to present\nadditional moral problems, over and above the daunting issues involved\nin interstate wars, or, as in the case of likelihood of success and\nproportionality, to involve more serious instances of difficulties\ncommon to both kinds of war. A theory of just revolutionary war ought\nto take these differences seriously and not begin with the assumption\nthat the commendable work that has recently been done in just war\ntheory—which as has been noted is mainly geared to interstate\nwar—can be adapted without significant modification or\naugmentation to the revolutionary case. The assumption that mainstream\njust war theory provides all or even most of what is needed for a\ntheory of just revolutionary wars seems plausible only if one traffics\nin unhelpful abstractions and fails to look at the differences\nrevealed by the empirical literature on revolutions and the special\nmoral issues they raise. A major conclusion of this entry is that a\nplausible moral theory of revolution must be informed by the best\nempirical studies of what actually goes on in revolutionary\nstruggles. \n“The morality of making revolutionary war” is too broad a\ntopic. It is necessary to factor out the distinctive moral problems\nfaced by those who initiate revolutionary war and aspire to recruit\nand lead others in the\n struggle[8]\n and those who join the revolution once it is underway and do so\nwithout any pretensions to being leaders. These two classes of agents\nboth face some common moral issues, but they also each must resolve\nmoral issues peculiar to their situation.  \nIt was noted in the preceding section that the question “Does\nagent X have rightful authority to wage revolutionary\nwar?” needs to be abandoned in favor of more fine-grained\nquestions: Does agent X have the rightful authority to start a\nrevolutionary war, to attempt to function as a leader in the struggle,\nto exercise various functions ordinarily reserved for governments such\nas punishing defectors and informants, conscripting soldiers,\nexpropriating resources needed for war, and suppressing rival\nclaimants to leadership? An affirmative answer to the first question\ndoes not guarantee affirmative answers to the rest. \nWe may begin with the first question: when do agents have the rightful\nauthority to try to initiate a revolutionary war? This is an\nappropriate question to ask if one attempts to apply mainstream\njus ad bellum theory to the case of revolutionary war, since\nrightful authority is generally assumed to be a requirement in jus\nad bellum. An initially plausible answer is that the agent must\nstand in a certain relationship to the people on whose behalf the\nrevolutionary war is to be waged. Different theorists have tried to\nspell out this relationship in different ways, asserting that the\ninitiator of revolutionary war (i) must have the consent of those on\nwhose behalf she claims to act, (ii) must have their approval, (iii)\nmust represent them, or (iv) must take responsibility for their common\ngood (and have the capacity to pursue it effectively). Each of these\nproposals will be considered in turn. The distinction between consent\nand approval is to be understood as follows: consent must be provided\nex ante, prior to the action to which consent is given;\napproval is ex post, a retrospective endorsement of an action\nthat has already occurred. \nThere are two problems with the view that consent of the oppressed is\neither necessary or sufficient for rightful authority to initiate\nrevolutionary war. First, in virtually every real world situation,\nconsent will not be unanimous; so two questions immediately present\nthemselves and a plausible answer to either is far from obvious: (1)\nif consent is necessary for rightful authority, how can anyone have\nrightful authority over those who do not consent; and (2) if the\nconsent of some is sufficient for rightful authority over all, how\nmany must consent (a bare majority, a supermajority, etc.)? If the\npoint of consent is that without it those who initiate revolutionary\nwar are arbitrarily putting those who do not consent at risk, then the\nfact that some have consented cannot make the imposition of risks on\nthose who did not consent any less arbitrary. Second, in the very\ncircumstances when the just cause for revolution is most compelling,\nnamely, where the regime exercises thorough-going domination and\nrefuses to reform, it will be difficult if not impossible to obtain\nvalid consent, either because the regime will not allow any plausible\nprocess of gaining consent or because people will be afraid to affirm\ntheir consent out of fear of retaliation by the regime, or because the\nregime’s oppression will have distorted their consciousness and\npreferences to such an extent that they are incapable of giving valid\nconsent. John Simmons (1979) has argued that even where the best\ndemocratic political processes are available, genuine consent cannot\nbe obtained; if that is so, then it is hardly likely that consent can\nbe gotten in the much less favorable circumstances in which the\naspiring revolutionary leadership might seek it. \nBecause of these difficulties with consent as a criterion for rightful\nauthority, one might think that approval is the appropriate notion.\nHowever, the same problems that afflicted consent render approval\ndubious. If approval is not unanimous, it is hard to see how the\napproval of some can confer rightful authority over all or justify the\nimposition of risks on all. But if unanimity is not required, it is\nunclear how much approval should be required.  \nThe problems with approval and consent might lead one to opt instead\nfor a notion of hypothetical consent or hypothetical approval: an\nagent has rightful authority to initiate (and attempt to lead) a\nrevolutionary war only if (or if and only if) her doing so would be\nconsented to or approved by a rational person and who rightly values\nfreedom from oppression, under those circumstances. This move presents\ntwo difficulties. First, it assumes something very problematic,\nnamely, that hypothetical consent is as morally potent as actual\nconsent (and, even more dubiously) that hypothetical approval can\nsubstitute for actual consent. Second, it appears that if a\ndetermination can be made of what a rational agent who rightly values\nfreedom from oppression would consent to or approve of, then the whole\nexercise becomes otiose, because the same result can be achieved by\ncalculating whether the initiation of the war satisfies the\nconventional criteria of likelihood of success, just cause, and\nproportionality. In other words, to the extent that the notion of what\na rational agent who rightly values freedom from oppression would\nconsent to or approve of can be ascertained, it appears that such an\nagent would make that determination by employing the least\ncontroversial jus ad bellum requirements. Further, different\nactual people will be affected differently by the revolution if it\noccurs and will weigh the risks and benefits differently, and should\ndo so to the extent that they are rational. If the notion of a\nrational agent abstracts from these differences, it is hard to see how\nwhat she would approve of or consent to could be relevant to whether\nrevolutionaries should subject actual people to the risks of\nrevolution. If the notion of a rational agent is particularized to the\nsituations of all actual individuals who would be affected by a\nrevolution, some would approve or consent and some would not, so there\nwill be no one answer to the question “Does this have rightful\nauthority?” because there will be no one answer to the question\n“Would a rational individual who rightly values freedom from\noppression consent to this agent initiating and leading a\nrevolutionary war?” \nConsider now the claim that those who initiate revolutionary wars (and\nassume leadership of them) have rightful authority to do so if or if\nand only if they represent the people (or at least those members of\nthe people who are oppressed). \nIf “represents” means what it does in the context of\nordinary democratic politics, namely, A represents B if and only if A\nis authorized to act on B’s behalf through some appropriate\npublic political process (such as an election), then this is a\nnon-starter, since an oppressive regime is unlikely to allow any such\nprocess. This standard, institutionally-based understanding of\nrepresentation would work as a criterion of rightful authority to\ninitiate revolutionary war only if one of two conditions were\nsatisfied. First, those who initiate revolutionary war were duly\nchosen as representatives prior to the advent of an oppressive regime\n(as when an authoritarian coup usurps an elected government). Second,\nthe constitutional order included pre-authorization for revolution\nunder certain specified conditions. It is worth noting that the French\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen explicitly included a\nright (and indeed a duty) to resist tyranny and that the Inner Service\nAct of the Turkish Armed Forces (articles 35 and 85) goes farther,\ndesignating an agent of revolution by pre-authorizing the military to\ndepose the government if it violates the constitutional requirement of\nsecular government. Just as an advance directive for medical care\nenables a competent patient to pre-authorize agent to act on her\nbehalf in the event of her losing the capacity to act, so a\nconstitutional provision of this sort would enable a people under\nconditions of political freedom to pre-authorize some agent to\ninitiate revolution on its behalf should the abuse of government\nauthority undermine its ability to perform an act of authorization.\nNeither of these two conditions will be satisfied if the country in\nquestion never had a political system that produced bona fide\nrepresentatives of the people or never had a constitution that\npre-authorized revolution. Interestingly, current discussions of\nrightful authority for waging revolutionary war do not consider the\npossibility of pre-authorization for initiating and leading\nrevolutions, thus following the unfortunate but widespread practice of\ndiscussing the morality of war as if institutions did not exist or\nwere relevant only as instruments for applying a system of moral\nprinciples that can be fully worked out by eliciting intuitions from\ncases of individual actions considered apart from any institutional\nbackground (Buchanan 2006, 2015). \nIn the absence of any institutional provisions for pre-authorization,\na proponent of the notion of representativeness might offer a\ndifferent understanding of it. An agent represents the people, in a\nfashion that morally empowers her to initiate and lead revolutionary\nwar, if she is committed to and acts appropriately to realize their\nshared interest or common good (Biggar 2013). It is worth noting just\nhow distant this view is from any widely accepted notion of rightful\nauthority to make war in other contexts or for that matter of rightful\nauthority in any context, whether private or public. The fact that\nJones is committed to Smith’s good and able to promote it\neffectively does nothing whatsoever to establish that Jones has\nrightful authority over Jones, much less that he has rightful\nauthority to undertake actions supposedly on Jones’s behalf that\npose a danger to Jones or others. Further, this notion is incapable of\nestablishing exclusive rightful authority, since there may be\nmore than one party, each contending for the role of leadership, all\nof which are committed to and capable of promoting the common good.\nThat is a significant problem, since one of the traditional rationales\nfor the rightful authority in just war theories is that there must be\nsome one authority on each side of an armed conflict, both to\nensure discipline among the armed forces so as to limit destruction,\nto achieve adherence to jus in bello principles, and so that\nit will be clear who should be party to negotiations to end the\nconflict and ensure a just peace. \nIf for these reasons one despairs of spelling out rightful authority\nin terms of actual or hypothetical consent or approval,\nrepresentativeness, or commitment to the common good, an alternative\napproach may appear attractive: jettison the assumption that\ninitiating and attempting to lead a revolutionary war always requires\nrightful authority. Argue instead that where the conditions on the\nground make rightful authority unobtainable, it can still sometimes be\nmorally justifiable for an agent to initiate a revolutionary war and\nattempt to lead it (Fabre 2012). Such a position was sketched earlier,\nin casting a critical eye on Kant’s rejection of revolution; it\ncan be further developed by employing an analogy with the\njustification of coercion in a state of violent\nanarchy—something akin to the state of nature as Hobbes\nunderstood it.  \nSuppose that there is a group of agents who have the capacity to\ncreate basic order, lifting all out of the state of radical physical\ninsecurity, but who can accomplish this only by imposing a coercively\nbacked set of rules under conditions in which there are no\ninstitutional resources for conferring rightful authority to perform\nthese tasks. Suppose in addition that there are no informal means for\nconferring rightful authority, that for reasons adduced earlier,\neither consent or approval cannot be ascertained due to severe\noppression or that they would fall significantly short of unanimity.\nSuppose also that these agents are committed to providing physical\nsecurity for all by the least coercive and fair means that are likely\nto be effective under the circumstances. Finally, suppose that they\nare committed to helping to build institutions that would make the\nlegitimate or rightfully authorized continued use of coercion possible\nand that they are publicly committed to relinquishing power should\nthose processes confer legitimacy on some other agents. Surely under\nthese conditions, such agents would be morally justified in wielding\ncoercive power, even if they lacked rightful authority. If that is so,\nthen instead of saying that coercive power may only be permissibly\nwielded by rightful authorities, one ought to say instead that\nrightful authority is required where the conditions for conferring\nauthority exists, but that where they do not, it may be morally\njustifiable to wield coercive power nonetheless, at least if this is\ndone in such a way as to promote the emergence of conditions under\nwhich legitimate use of coercion can exist. \nIn extreme cases, tyrannies are sufficiently like a state of violent\nanarchy that it appears that the same conclusion holds there as well.\nIf a group of agents can end such a tyranny and establish a minimally\njust order in which all can enjoy physical security and if it is\ncommitted to doing so by the least coercive means and in observation\nof basic principles of fairness and is also committed to helping to\nestablish the conditions under which the exercise of coercive power\ncan become legitimate or rightfully authorized, then it appears that\nit would be morally justified in initiating and leading a\nrevolutionary war to create such conditions. \nWhether or not this sort of argument for abandoning the unqualified\ncommitment to a principle of rightful authority in the case of\nrevolutionary wars is ultimately persuasive, it appears to have\nsufficient initial plausibility to call into question the assumption\nthat if rightful authority is a requirement for just interstate wars,\nthen it is also so for revolutionary wars in all cases. So, one\ncentral issue for a comprehensive theory of just revolutionary war is\nwhether the requirement of rightful authorization for initiating and\nleading armed revolutionary struggles is unconditionally valid. If the\nanswer is that it is, then it appears that initiating a\nrevolutionary war will rarely if ever be justified.  \nIt does not follow, however, that joining the fight, once it has\nstarted, is unjustified whenever the initiation of the conflict was\nunjustified (Buchanan 2013). Whether various individuals are morally\njustified in joining the war effort depends upon whether they have\nmorally acceptable reasons for doing so, not upon the morality or\nimmorality of the actions others took to initiate the conflict. If\nthat is the case, then the earlier suggestion that “the morality\nof revolutionary war” must be disaggregated into the morality of\nvarious parties is vindicated. The justification for initiating\nrevolution will be different from the justification for joining a\nrevolution. This point is not limited to revolutionary wars, but it\nmay be more significant in the revolutionary case, if generally\nspeaking the initiation of revolutionary wars is harder to justify\nthan some interstate wars, especially wars of self-defense or defense\nof others against aggression. \nThere are several reasons, as already noted, why revolutionary wars\nmay be especially hard to justify. The most obvious, as noted in\nSection 3, are that there are many ways in which the aim of\nestablishing a more just political order may be frustrated and hence\nit may be hard to satisfy the requirement of a reasonable likelihood\nof success. Another problem is the difficulty of determining that a\nproportionality requirement is satisfied. Indeed, some of the most\ndaunting moral issues of revolutionary war arise when one attempts to\napply the standard just war requirement of proportionality as a\nnecessary condition for justified initiation of revolutionary war.\n \nOne issue is whether violent revolutions against “lesser\ntyrannies” can ever be proportional. “Greater\ntyrannies” engage in large-scale violations of the right of\nphysical security, killings and maimings, or they literally enslave\ntheir peoples. “Lesser tyrannies” refrain from those\nactions, but violate other important rights, including the right to\ndemocratic government and various other civil and political rights,\nsuch as the right to freedoms of religion, expression, and assembly.\nSome theorists have argued that it would be unjustified to make war\nagainst any party, whether another country’s armed forces or\none’s own government, that “merely” engaged in\n“lesser tyranny”, because lethal force is only\nproportional when it is used to combat the wrongful use of lethal\nforce (or to avoid being reduced to a slave). David Rodin (2003), for\nexample, contends that it would be wrong for the people of one country\nto use lethal force to resist and invasion by another country whose\nleaders were only intent on imposing a “lesser tyranny”.\nIn other words, he denies that the right of self-defense could ever\njustify violence against an invader that “merely” wished\nto destroy a nation’s sovereignty. He even goes so far as to say\nthat if an individual invaded one’s home and one had reason to\nbelieve that if one resisted the invasion the invader would use lethal\nforce, thus triggering one’s own right to use lethal force in\ndefense of oneself and one’s family, one should hide from the\ninvader in order to avoid this escalation. Jeff McMahan (1994) argues,\nin contrast, that there is no duty to avoid such an escalation, and\nthat even if it would be disproportionate to initiate lethal\nforce against an invader intent only on “lesser tyranny”,\nit would not be disproportionate to respond with lethal force to an\ninvader who made a “conditional threat” of lethal force,\nthat is, who asserted that she would use lethal force in response to\nany form of resistance, including nonviolent resistance (Frowe and\nLazar 2017). McMahan also asserts that one need not wait for the\nrealization of the “conditional threat” of the invader to\nbe imminent before using lethal force to counter it if that is the\nonly way to be assured of one’s safety (McMahan 1994). Finlay\n(2015) agrees with McMahan’s conclusion and explicitly applies\nit to the case of revolutionary wars, holding that it is justifiable\nto make revolutionary war against a regime that is merely a\n“lesser tyranny” if that regime responds with lethal force\nto nonviolent resistance. The case that McMahan and Finlay develop\nagainst Rodin’s austere view can be strengthened by noting that\nunder the existing international order, a norm that allows war-making\nto prevent the loss of sovereignty, at least in the case of reasonably\ndemocratic and rights-respecting countries, makes good sense because\nthe state is the primary locus for the establishment of basic justice\nand the protection of human rights.  \nThat said, Rodin, McMahan, and Finlay share two questionable\nassumptions. First, that the use of lethal force can be proportional\nonly if it is used against lethal force (or perhaps against\nenslavement as well); and second, that the proportionality assessment\nshould only encompass harms to those directly affected. Against the\nfirst assumption, Mattias Iser (2017) has argued that respect for\ncivil and political rights not only serves to protect important\ninterests but also has the expressive function of publicly recognizing\nequal basic moral status. Given the fundamental moral importance of\nsuch recognition, the violation of these rights, at least when it is a\nfeature of the basic structure of society, can justify violent\nrevolution (Iser 2017: 208–214). Put differently, those who have\nheld that proportionality prohibits revolutionary war against\n“lesser tyranny” have failed to see that the interest in\nbeing recognized as having equal basic moral status, not just the\ninterest in physical security or the avoidance of slavery, is of such\nmoral importance as to justify the use of lethal force as a last\nresort. \nThe second problematic assumption shared by Rodin, McMahan, and Finlay\nin their discussions of proportionality is that only harms to the\nparties directly affected count. But revolutionary war against\n“lesser tyranny” might well be proportional if, instead,\nthe harm to innocent people the revolution will cause were weighed,\nnot just against the harm the tyranny is doing to the current\ngeneration of the people, but against that when combined with the harm\nto future generations if the tyranny is not overthrown. And, of\ncourse, revolutionaries often try to justify the violence that will\nresult from their conduct by saying that it will be compensated for by\nthe benefits gained or the harm averted for many people to come.  \nThere is yet another way in which the class of harms to be considered\nin proportionality assessments might be expanded: the effects of\nrevolutionary war against “lesser tyranny” on valid\nnorm compliance might also be included. Suppose the valid norm is\nthat governments are not to be tyrannical, that they are not only to\nrefrain from killings, maiming, and enslavement, but are also to\nrespect civil and political rights, including especially the right to\ndemocratic government, primarily because rights to physical security\nare best realized in democracies. Suppose also that because of weak\ninternational institutions, the best prospect for enforcing a norm of\ngood government is the threat of revolution against governments that\nviolate the norm. Under these conditions, it would be problematic to\nrestrict proportionality assessments to immediate, direct harms,\nignoring the effects on the enforcement of important norms of justice.\nMost but not all contemporary discussions of proportionality ignore\nthe possibility of justifying violence for the sake of norm\nenforcement, because they elaborate on intuitions stimulated by\none-off consideration of cases viewed in isolation, rather than taking\ninto account the effect of particular actions on patterns of behavior\npersisting over time (Fabre 2012, Rodin 2011). And because they\nlargely ignore institutions, they do not consider the requirements of\neffective international norm enforcement under conditions in which\ninternational institutions for enforcement are weak.  \nThose who exclude from assessments of proportionality effects on\nfuture generations and on norm enforcement might reply as follows.\nEven if in principle it makes sense to consider such wider effects, in\npractice any attempt to do so would require calculations so difficult\nand prone to error that, as an action-guiding principle, the\nproportionality requirement ought to construe harms more narrowly. As\nit stands, this reply is unconvincing, because it assumes, without\nargument, that the risks of error or abuse attendant on a wider\nconstrual of harms relevant to proportionality clearly outweigh the\napparent impropriety of ignoring what appear to be whole classes of\nmorally relevant harms. \nThere is one more way in which institutional capacity can affect\nproportionality. If international or regional institutions provided\nfor effective intervention in support of just revolutions, then the\nrisks of failed or corrupted revolutions and of violent anarchy that\nlead some theorists to deny that revolution can be justified would be\nmitigated, with the result that engaging in revolution could satisfy\nthe proportionality requirement. Once again, it is clear that the\nvalidity of a theory of just revolutionary war depends upon the\nvalidity of empirical assumptions about institutional capacity.\nUnfortunately, many theorists of the morality of armed conflict either\nignore issues of institutional capacity or assume that the current\npaucity of institutional resources cannot be remedied. \nThus far the moral complexities of revolutionary jus ad\nbellum have been the focus of the discussion, emphasizing in\nparticular the difficulty of satisfying the requirements of rightful\nauthority and proportionality. The jus in bello component of\na theory of just revolutionary war is also morally complex. A key\nissue that a theory of the morality of revolutionary war ought to\naddress is whether widely accepted jus in bello norms apply\nwithout exception to war-making by revolutionaries or whether,\ninstead, revolutionaries are morally permitted to undertake acts of\nwar that the military personnel of states are usually prohibited from\nperforming. This is not a merely theoretical issue: revolutionary\nwarriors have often engaged in various morally problematic forms of\n“irregular” warfare. They have assassinated civilian\nleaders and other civilians such as government bureaucrats and judges,\nattacked regime forces while wearing civilian attire (not wearing\nuniforms or insignia as required by the laws of war and not carrying\nweapons openly), and engaged in terrorism, deliberately killing\nindividuals who had no discernible connection with the regime by\ndetonating bombs in public places.\n [9]\n Furthermore, in order to mobilize people to join the revolution or to\ndeter them from aiding the regime in suppressing it, they have engaged\nin acts of terrorism against the oppressed.  \nContemporary theorists who have addressed the morality of irregular\nwarfare have generally argued that terrorism, whether its goal is to\npersuade the regime to capitulate or to coerce the oppressed into\njoining the revolution or not supporting the regime, is morally\nimpermissible. Most of the controversy concerns whether any or all of\nthe other forms of irregular warfare are permissible and if so under\nwhat conditions. This author (Buchanan 2013) has argued that even if\nterrorism perpetrated against members of the oppressed population is\nunjustified, some forms of coercion may be permissible, as when\nrevolutionary fighters are conscripted through the threat of penalties\nsuch as expropriation of property or even perhaps confinement or\nlesser restrictions on liberty. The most plausible justification for\nsuch methods of coerced mobilization would characterize the goals of\nthe revolution as public goods of extraordinary moral importance and\npresent coercion as a solution to the collective action problem.\nWhether coercive mobilization would be justified would depend on at\nleast two factors: whether the forms of coercion employed were\nnecessary, whether they were the least restrictive among the effective\nalternatives and whether the burdens of coercion were distributed\nfairly (Finlay 2015: 87–124). \nThose who argue that it is permissible for revolutionaries to target\ncivilians tend to argue that only those civilians who contribute in\nsome significant way to the oppressive activities of the regime lie\nbeyond the protection of the jus in bello norm of\ndiscrimination. The basic idea here, as Finlay puts it, is to justify\nsuch acts as the targeting of individuals who are morally liable to be\nkilled because they are not morally innocent, that is, they are active\nand significant contributors to the regime’s violent injustices\n(Finlay 2015: 55–86, 217–218). But what counts as\nsignificant contribution is both unclear and disputed. For example, a\nfarmer who supplies food for a tyranny’s secret police or\nrepairs the vehicles that they use to hunt down dissidents clearly\nmakes a contribution to their depredations, but it is unclear whether\nthat sort of contribution makes her liable to lethal attack (Fabre\n2009, Frowe 2014). \nA second set of issues in revolutionary jus in bello concerns\nthe permissibility of revolutionary warriors engaging in\n“partisan war”--not wearing uniforms or insignia or\ncarrying arms openly or doing so but then changing into civilian\nattire immediately after an attack so as to melt back into the\npopulation. Those who argue that such actions are permissible\ntypically appeal to fairness. The idea is that, at least in the early\nstages of their struggle, revolutionaries are at a great disadvantage\nvis à vis government forces, that this disadvantage is\nsomething for which they are not responsible, and that the\nrevolutionaries should not be expected to let it render unsuccessful\ntheir struggle against a seriously unjust regime. Revolutionaries\ntypically have inferior arms and logistical capacities, they have no\nsafe rear areas behind which they can regroup and resupply because\nthere are no battle lines as in conventional wars, and when they face\na ruthless tyranny it is unlikely that their opponents will observe\njus bello norms. Finlay asserts that if these forms of\n“partisan war” are undertaken to defend innocent people\nagainst the regime’s wrongful harm to them, then they should be\nseen as justifiable efforts to achieve the protection of morally\ninnocent individuals that is the rationale for the discrimination norm\n(Finlay 2015: 55–86, 217–218).  \nThe argument against the permissibility of “partisan\nwarfare” is that the requirement of uniforms and insignia\nfacilitates better compliance with the discrimination norm, making it\neasier for regime forces to refrain from killing noncombatants. That\nargument is of limited force if the regime is likely to violate the\ndiscrimination norm anyway. A tyranny that routinely violates basic\nhuman rights in peacetime is unlikely to become scrupulous in use of\nforce in a revolutionary conflict (Meisels 2008). \nThe topic of revolution presents a fertile and challenging field for\nmoral theory and applied or practical ethics—and one in which\nthe greater part of systematic thinking remains to be done. Violent\nrevolutions typically present the most serious and difficult moral\nissues. Until recently, the excellent work done by contemporary just\nwar theories has not given the peculiar moral problems of\nrevolutionary war the attention they deserve, but there is reason to\nbelieve that this deficiency will be remedied. Because the success of\na revolution may depend upon whether there is intervention in support\nof it, a comprehensive theory of the morality of revolution should\ncohere with a theory of the morality of intervention (Buchanan 2016).\nAnother topic that a comprehensive theory of just revolutionary war\nshould address is the moral assessment of the international Law of\nArmed Conflict’s asymmetry with regard to the rights of\ncombatants acting on behalf of states and revolutionary warriors. The\nLaw of Armed Conflict assigns the latter the same legal duties as the\nformer, but grants them a much leaner set of legal rights.","contact.mail":"allen.buchanan@duke.edu","contact.domain":"duke.edu"}]
