But the use of the term\n“Aristotelianism” as applied to texts, contents and\ncontexts of that period is\n problematic.[1]  \n Some authors did indeed consider themselves as part of a\n“peripatetic” (i.e., Aristotelian) current or\n school,[2]  \n but it would be counterintuitive to limit the application of the term\n“Aristotelianism” only to those authors of whom such\nstatements are known (since it probably would exclude most Renaissance\ncommentators on Aristotle). [3] \n On the other hand, if we use the term\n“Aristotelianism” to denote everything in Renaissance\nphilosophy that with some high degree of probability makes direct or\nindirect use of Aristotle’s texts: this would mean that\n“Aristotelianism in the Renaissance” and “Philosophy\nin the Renaissance” are equivalent terms (cf. Keßler\n1990).\n\n\n\nHowever, there are texts in Renaissance philosophy that are obviously\nmore “Aristotelian” than others, namely, the\ncommentaries on texts by Aristotle.  There are more of them\nthan we have from any other period of the history of philosophy. And\nin many of the Renaissance universities philosophy training\nwas keyed to the interpretation of texts by Aristotle and often\ninvolved the use of textbooks derived from works by Aristotle and his\ncommentators. In addition to this, the corpus Aristotelicum\nwas used as a matrix for textbooks and encyclopedias and as a\nstarting point for treatises on more or less special philosophical\n questions.[4]\n\n\nIn no other period of the history of philosophy, as far as we know,\nhave so many commentaries on works by Aristotle been written (both per\nyear and in total) as in the\n Renaissance.[5] \n Even on the incomplete basis of Lohr’s first version of his catalogue\nof Renaissance Latin Aristotle\n Commentaries[6] \n Richard Blum has counted 6653 such commentaries for the period\n1500 to\n 1650.[7] \n The magnitude of this number should be considered\nsignificant—especially in comparison to the ca. 750\ncommentaries listed for the fifteenth century in Lohr’s\ncatalogue of “mediaeval” Aristotle\n commentaries.[8] \n\nThe real reasons of this increase of interest are yet\nunknown. However, the reasons might include: \n\nIt is possible to name Renaissance Aristotle commentaries influenced\nby one or more of each of these. As a whole, the reasons given above\ncontribute to the great variety of what can be found in Renaissance\nAristotle\n commentaries[11].\n It may even be that such delightful variety is what chiefly attracts\ncurrent scholars to studying this genre of philosophical\nliterature. And yet most of these commentaries have not yet been\nstudied by anyone since the \n Renaissance.[12] \n\nThere have been some attempts to sort Renaissance Aristotle\ncommentators into groups according to their use of or degree of\nadherence to pre-Renaissance Aristotle commentaries (e.g.,\n“Averroist”, “Alexandrist”,\n“Thomist” schools/groups/traditions). However, it is\ndoubtful that such a sorting contributes to a better understanding of\ntheir texts and contexts.  This is because many authors of Aristotle\ncommentaries—including some who had a particular preference\nfor one or more of the earlier commentators—used the earlier\ncommentaries on a case by case basis. \n\nAs far as we know, most of these commentaries were written for use in\na university setting (see below). As a consequence, the choice of\ntexts commented upon and the degree of detail given to a certain\npassage is often due, at least in part, to its use in a classroom, a\nuniversitarian debate or its relevance for exams. \n\nThere are no sharp borderlines between commentaries proper, textbooks,\nencyclopedias, and treatises. (Philipp Melanchthon’s works on ethics\nmight be a good illustration of this: “Melanchthon on\nEthics” starts as something which is a commentary on parts of\nthe Nicomachean Ethics [Melanchthon, 1535] and—in the\n1550 and later versions, now edited and translated by Günter Frank—was \ndeveloped into something which is a textbook in which rather few\ntraces of and similarities to the commentary genre are left\n[Melanchthon, 2008].)  And even where the work in question is a\ncommentary in the most narrow sense of the word, the text can be some\nsort of bibliographie raisonée of the previous\nliterature (e.g., some of Augustinus Niphus’s texts), a decent guide\nto some probable meaning of Aristotle’s text (e.g., some of Cesare\nCremonini’s commentaries on the Parva naturalia), or a text\nwritten in order to influence the political world of the day (e.g.,\nAntonio Montecatini’s commentary on the third book of Aristotle’s\npolitics [Montecatini, 1597]), or anything in-between. \n\nAlthough most of the commentaries apparently deal with those texts\nfrom the corpus aristotelicum that have been the focus of\ninterest from the 13th century to today, the Renaissance is a period\nwhere the percentage of commentaries and other texts dealing with the works of Aristotle less frequently read today (e.g., the\nProblemata, the Parva naturalia) is higher than\none might expect. \n\nAlthough there seems to be no simple answer to the question of which\nRenaissance institutions of “higher education” should be\nconsidered as\n “universities”;[13]  \n there is neither doubt nor conflict about the fact, that there were\nmany universities, and that many of them were founded in the\n Renaissance.[14]  \n And at virtually all of them much of the philosophy taught there was\ndirectly or indirectly founded on parts of the corpus\naristotelicum. And, given the wide range of texts (commentaries,\ntreatises, textbooks, collections of theses for disputations …)\nmaking use of that corpus and being related directly or\nindirectly to some sort of “universitarian” context and/or\nuse, and the fact that the overwhelming majority of the texts this\nentry is about are texts related directly or indirectly to some sort\nof such context and/or use, perhaps “Renaissance University\nTexts in Philosophy” might be an even better description for\nwhat this entry is about than its real title “Aristotelianism in\nthe Renaissance”. \n\nIn general, only some of the fields covered by the corpus\naristotelicum were part of any single university curriculum. We\ndo not yet have a survey on what was taught where and when, so we\ncannot yet give a complete\n assessment,[15]  \n but permitting some margin of error, we can say: \n\nIt seems difficult (or even impossible) to find a single statement on\nwhich all known Renaissance “Aristotelians”\nagree. This may be due, in part, to the specialization of teachers\n(Melanchthon not agreeing that all knowledge rises from the senses,\nCremonini disinterested in moral philosophy and thus not making\nstatements on virtues, …).  \n\nThere are a few explicit statements of the reasons for basing the\nteaching of philosophy at universities on the corpus\naristotelicum or works derived from it. Augustinus Niphus (died\n1538)—who probably gave the fullest treatment of this\nquestion—gives the following\n reasons (Niphus, 1544, f. †††† 2vb): \n The parts of philosophy are treated by Aristotle one by one in books\neach of which is dedicated to just one part of philosophy; he proceeds\nfrom what is better known to us to that which is less known to us; he\nfinds out about things by discussing views held by others; he treats\neverything with apt ampleness and conciseness; his style is that of a\nphilosopher and not that of an orator; he is consistent. \n\nPhilipp Melanchthon states, in his 1536 oration “On\nPhilosophy” (Melanchthon, 1843), that you have to choose a\ngenre of philosophy which is not sophistic, and which adheres\nto the correct method, and that the one taught by Aristotle is such a\n philosophy.[18]\n (He then continues to reject stoic, epicurean and platonic\nalternatives … .)  \n\nNote that neither Niphus nor Melanchthon claim that a reason for using\nthe corpus aristotelicum as the basis of teaching philosophy\nat universities is the truth of any of Aristotle’s\n statements.[19] \n Melanchthon goes on to request that, in addition to Aristotle, other\nauthors should be used for some fields, something that is admitted\nalso by\n Niphus.[20]  \n Philosophy taught at Renaissance universities uses Aristotle as its\nmain starting point and main basis, but (at least in many cases)\nAristotle (together with his commentators) is not the only basis of\nphilosophy taught at Renaissance\n universities.[21] \n\nInterest in Renaissance university philosophy has been rekindled by\nErnest Renan who investigated several philosophers teaching at Padua\n(Renan, 1866), and “Paduan” Renaissance university\nphilosophy is the part of “Renaissance Aristotelianism”\nthat has been most thoroughly studied. But as research progresses and\nmore knowledge is gained about more universities and authors, the\nimage gets more complex and less apt for generalizations. This adds\ninsight into the diversity of the traditions at each university and\nthe diversity of philosophies taught by teachers at each \n one.[22] \n These teachers are probably best studied as single philosophers, and\nnot as mere adherents or members of some\n school.[23] \n\nTextbooks and encyclopedias are not necessarily contrasting\ngenres, as sometimes encyclopedias were used as textbooks. In\nspite of being (again) based on Aristotle (and his commentators), some\ntextbooks did provide more “untraditional” views by\nintegrating material found in Aristotle (and his commentators) with\nmaterial found in other\n authors.[24] \n Other textbooks provided untraditional views by their choice of what\nthey retained and what they left out and how they paraphrased what\nthey\n retained.[25] \n\nAlthough these textbooks are not proper ‘commentaries’ on\nthe works of Aristotle, in some cases they provide sensible\ninterpretation of statements by Aristotle beyond many\n  commentaries.[26] \n\nSchmitt’s “The rise of the philosophical textbook” (1988)\nremains the definitive text to read on philosophical textbooks in the\nRenaissance. \n\nCommentaries and textbooks are not the only types of texts used for\ninterpreting, discussing, defending, adapting and transforming the\ndoctrines of Aristotle (and his commentators) in the\nRenaissance. Specialized treatises cover a wide range of subjects:\non the immortality of the soul, on innate heat, on the agent sense,\non the regressus, on vapour, on rhetoric imitation,\n….  These treatises often treat a certain subject more or\nless for its own sake, and not just in order to find out what was\nAristotle’s opinion on it—though the author will often settle\nfor a position that he believes to be the position of Aristotle. \n\nMany printed collections of theses (for doctoral dissertations or\nother purposes) can also be considered as specialized monographs\n— though in the form we have them most of them do not provide us\nwith the argumentations that lead to the assumptions made. \n\nFrancisco Patrizi’s Discussiones peripateticæ\n(Patrizi, 1581), although not a pro-Aristotelian text, is one of the\nmost learned works on the subject of Aristotle and the Aristotelian\ntraditions we have from the Renaissance.  And it does not easily\nfit into any of the sections used here. \n\nThe ancient habit of sorting philosophers into schools or groups seems\nfirst to have been applied to Aristotelian philosophers by Francisco\n Patrizi [Franciscus Patritius][27]\n in his Discussiones peripateticæ. It is an approach,\nthat is useful to give order to a text that treats a great number of\nRenaissance\n Aristotelians.[28]  \n But in a text not trying to give at least superficial doxographical\ninformation concerning the single philosophers and their works, it\nmight (correctly) be interpreted as a pretext not to study these\nphilosophers and their\n works.[29] \n And the charming character of Renaissance “Aristotelian” texts\nis more situated in their (considerable) diversities than in their\n(limited) similarities.","contact.mail":"hck@lrz.uni-muenchen.de","contact.domain":"lrz.uni-muenchen.de"}]
