His influential friends (who included Jeremy\nBentham, James Mill, John Stuart Mill and Thomas Carlyle) were\nimpressed by his intellect and his conversation, and predicted he\nwould go far. However, in public dealings, Austin’s nervous\ndisposition, shaky health, tendency towards melancholy, and\nperfectionism combined to end quickly careers at the Bar, in academia,\nand in government service (Hamburger 1985, 1992). \n\nAustin was born to a Suffolk merchant family, and served briefly in\nthe military before beginning his legal training. He was called to the\nBar in 1818, but he took on few cases, and quit the practice of law in\n1825. Austin shortly thereafter obtained an appointment to the first\nChair of Jurisprudence at the recently established University of\nLondon. He prepared for his lectures by study in Bonn, and evidence of\nthe influence of continental legal and political ideas can be found\nscattered throughout Austin’s writings.  Commentators have found\nevidence in Austin’s writings of the German Pandectist treatment of\nRoman Law, in particular, its approach to law as something that is, or\nshould be, systematic and coherent (Schwarz 1934; Stein 1988:\npp. 223–229, 238–244; Lobban 1991: pp. 223–256). \n\nLectures from the course he gave were eventually published in 1832 as\n“Province of Jurisprudence Determined” (Austin 1832).\nHowever, attendance at his courses was small and getting smaller, and\nhe gave his last lecture in 1833. A short-lived effort to give a\nsimilar course of lectures at the Inner Temple met the same\nresult. Austin resigned his University of London Chair in 1835.  He\nlater briefly served on the Criminal Law Commission, and as a Royal\nCommissioner to Malta, but he never found either success or\ncontentment. He did some occasional writing on political themes, but\nhis plans for longer works never came to anything during his lifetime,\ndue apparently to some combination of perfectionism, melancholy, and\nwriter’s block. His changing views on moral, political, and legal\nmatters also apparently hindered both the publication of a revised\nedition of “Province of Jurisprudence Determined,” and the\ncompletion of a longer project started when his views had been\ndifferent. \n\n(Some scholars have argued that Austin may have moved away from\nanalytical jurisprudence (see below) towards something more\napproximating the historical jurisprudence school; cf. Hamburger 1985:\npp.  178–91, arguing for Austin’s views having changed\nsignificantly, with Rumble 2013, arguing against that view.) \n\nMuch of whatever success Austin found during his life, and after, must\nbe attributed to his wife Sarah, for her tireless support, both moral\nand economic (during the later years of their marriage, they lived\nprimarily off her efforts as a translator and reviewer), and her work\nto publicize his writings after his death (including the publication\nof a more complete set of his Lectures on Jurisprudence) (Austin\n1879).  Credit should also be given to Austin’s influential friends,\nwho not only helped him to secure many of the positions he held during\nhis lifetime, but also gave important support for his writings after\nhis death (Hamburger 1985: pp. 33, 197; Morison 1982: p. 17; Mill\n1863).  \n\nAustin’s work was influential in the decades after his passing away.\nE. C. Clark wrote in the late 19th century that Austin’s work “is\nundoubtedly forming a school of English jurists, possibly of English\nlegislators also.  It is the staple of jurisprudence in all our\nsystems of legal education.” (Clark 1883: pp. 4–5) A similar\nassessment is made by H.L.A. Hart, looking back nearly a century\nlater: “within a few years of his death it was clear that his\nwork had established the study of jurisprudence in England”\n(Hart 1955: p. xvi). As will be discussed, Austin’s influence can be\nseen at a number of levels, including the general level of how legal\ntheory, and law generally, were taught (Stein 1988: pp. 238–244), and\nthe use of an analytical approach in legal theory.  At such levels,\nAustin’s impact is felt to this day.  Hart could write that\n“Austin’s influence on the development of England of\n[Jurisprudence] has been greater than that of any other writer,”\n(Hart 1955: p. xvi) even while Austin’s particular command theory of\nlaw became almost friendless, and is today probably best known from\nHart’s use of it (1958, 1994) as a foil for the elaboration of Hart’s\nown, more nuanced approach to legal theory. In recent decades, some\ntheorists have revisited Austin’s command theory (and other works),\noffering new characterizations and defenses of his ideas (e.g.,\nMorison 1982, Rumble 1985, see generally Freeman & Mindus 2013). \n\nEarly in his career, Austin came under the influence of Jeremy\nBentham, and Bentham’s utilitarianism is evident (though with some\ndifferences) in the work for which Austin is best known today. On\nAustin’s reading of utilitarianism, Divine will is equated with\nUtilitarian principles: “The commands which God has revealed we\nmust gather from the terms wherein they are promulg[ate]d.  The\ncommand which he has not revealed, we must construe by the principle\nof utility” (Austin 1873: Lecture IV, p. 160; see also Austin\n1832: Lecture II, p. 41).  This particular reading of\nutilitarianism, however, has had little long-term influence, though it\nseems to have been the part of his work that received the most\nattention in his own day (Rumble 1995: p. xx).  Some have also seen\nAustin as being one of the early advocates of “rule\nutilitarianism.”(e.g., Austin 1832: Lecture II, p. 42,\nwhere Austin urges that we analyze not the utility of particular acts,\nbut that of “class[es] of action”).  Additionally, Austin\nearly on shared many of the ideas of the Benthamite philosophical\nradicals; he was “a strong proponent of modern political\neconomy, a believer in Hartleian metaphysics, and a most enthusiastic\nMalthusian” (Rumble 1985: pp. 16–17).  Austin was to lose most\nof his “radical” inclinations as he grew older.  \n\nAustin’s importance to legal theory lies elsewhere—his\ntheorizing about law was novel at four different levels of\ngenerality. First, he was arguably the first writer to approach the\ntheory of law analytically (as contrasted with approaches to law more\ngrounded in history or sociology, or arguments about law that were\nsecondary to more general moral and political theories). Analytical\njurisprudence emphasizes the analysis of key concepts, including\n“law,” “(legal) right,” “(legal)\nduty,” and “legal validity.” Though analytical\njurisprudence has been challenged by some in recent years (e.g.,\nLeiter 2007, 2017), it remains the dominant approach to discussing the\nnature of law. Analytical jurisprudence, an approach to theorizing\nabout law, has sometimes been confused with what the American legal\nrealists (an influential group of theorists prominent in the early\ndecades of the 20th century) called “legal\nformalism”—a narrow approach to how judges should decide\ncases. The American legal realists saw Austin in particular, and\nanalytical jurisprudence in general, as their opponents in their\ncritical and reform-minded efforts (e.g., Sebok 1998:\npp. 65–69). In this, the realists were simply mistaken;\nunfortunately, it is a mistake that can still be found in some\ncontemporary legal commentators (see Bix 1999, 903–919, for\ndocumentation). \n\nSecond, Austin’s work should be seen against a background where most\nEnglish judges and commentators saw common-law reasoning (the\nincremental creation or modification of law through judicial\nresolution of particular disputes) as supreme, as declaring existing\nlaw, as discovering the requirements of “Reason,” as the\nimmemorial wisdom of popular “custom.” Such\n(Anglo-American) theories about common law reasoning fit with a larger\ntradition of theorizing about law (which had strong roots in\ncontinental European thought—e.g., the historical jurisprudence of\ntheorists like Karl Friedrich von Savigny (1975)): the idea that\ngenerally law did or should reflect community mores,\n“spirit,” or custom.  In general, one might look at many\nof the theorists prior to Austin as exemplifying an approach that was\nmore “community-oriented”—law as arising from\nsocietal values or needs, or expressive of societal customs or\nmorality.  By contrast, Austin’s is one of the first, and one of the\nmost distinctive, theories that views law as being “imperium\noriented”—viewing law as mostly the rules imposed from\nabove from certain authorized (pedigreed) sources.  More\n“top-down” theories of law, like that of Austin, better\nfit the more centralized governments (and the modern political\ntheories about government) of modern times (Cotterrell 2003:\npp. 21–77).\n \n\nThird, within analytical jurisprudence, Austin was the first\nsystematic exponent of a view of law known as “legal\npositivism.” Most of the important theoretical work on law prior\nto Austin had treated jurisprudence as though it were merely a branch\nof moral theory or political theory: asking how should the state\ngovern? (and when were governments legitimate?), and under what\ncircumstances did citizens have an obligation to obey the law? Austin\nspecifically, and legal positivism generally, offered a quite\ndifferent approach to law: as an object of “scientific”\nstudy (Austin 1879: pp. 1107–1108), dominated neither by\nprescription nor by moral evaluation. Subtle jurisprudential questions\naside, Austin’s efforts to treat law systematically gained popularity\nin the late 19th century among English lawyers who wanted to approach\ntheir profession, and their professional training, in a more serious\nand rigorous manner.  (Hart 1955: pp. xvi–xviii; Cotterrell 2003:\npp. 74–77; Stein 1988: pp. 231–244) \n\nLegal positivism asserts (or assumes) that it is both possible and\nvaluable to have a morally neutral descriptive (or\n“conceptual”—though this is not a term Austin used)\ntheory of law. (The main competitor to legal positivism, in Austin’s\nday as in our own, has been natural law theory.) Legal positivism does\nnot deny that moral and political criticism of legal systems is\nimportant, but insists that a descriptive or conceptual approach to\nlaw is valuable, both on its own terms and as a necessary prelude to\ncriticism. (The term “legal positivism” is sometimes used more\nbroadly to include the position that we should construct or modify our\nconcept of law to remove moral criteria of legal validity; or to\ninclude a prescription that moral values should not be used in\njudicial decision-making (Schauer 2010—see the Other Internet\nResources). I do not think anything turns on whether the term is used\nmore broadly or more narrowly, as long as it is clear which sense is\nbeing used.  Additionally, while Schauer claims (2010) that Austin\ncould be seen as supporting some of the views associated with the\nbroader understanding of “legal positivism”, there is need\nfor more evidence and argument before the point should be\ngranted.) \n\nThere were theorists prior to Austin who arguably offered views\nsimilar to legal positivism or who at least foreshadowed legal\npositivism in some way. Among these would be Thomas Hobbes, with his\namoral view of laws as the product of Leviathan (Hobbes 1996); David\nHume, with his argument for separating “is” and\n“ought” (which worked as a sharp criticism for some forms\nof natural law theory, those that purported to derive moral truths from\nstatements about human nature) (Hume 1739, Section 3.1.1); and Jeremy Bentham, with\nhis attacks on judicial lawmaking and on those commentators, like Sir William\nBlackstone, who justified such lawmaking with natural-law-like\njustifications (Bentham 1789). \n\nAustin’s famous formulation of what could be called the “dogma” of\nlegal positivism is as follows: (While Austin saw himself as criticizing natural law theory, a view\nshared by most of the legal positivists who followed him, the extent\nto which the two schools disagree, and the location of their\ndisagreement, remains a matter sharply contested (e.g., Finnis 2000a,\n2000b.)) \n\nAndrew Halpin has argued (Halpin 2013) that Austin shaped the nature\nof modern analytical jurisprudence and legal positivism by his choice\nto exclude legal reasoning from his discussion of\n“jurisprudence.” A greater focus on legal reasoning,\nHalpin argues, would have made it harder to claim a clear separation\nof law “as it is” and law “as it ought to be.”\nHalpin points out that prominent later legal positivists have followed\nAustin, either in speaking little about legal reasoning (Hans Kelsen,\nand, to some extent, H. L. A. Hart), or speaking about the topic at\nlength, but treating the issue as sharply separate from their theories of\n(the nature of) law. \n\nFourth, Austin’s version of legal positivism, a “command theory\nof law” (which will be detailed in the next section), was also,\nfor a time, quite influential.  Austin’s theory had similarities with\nviews developed by Jeremy Bentham, whose theory could also be\ncharacterized as a “command theory.” Bentham, in a\nposthumously published work, defined law as an: \n\nHowever, Austin’s command theory was more influential than Bentham’s,\nbecause the latter’s jurisprudential writings did not appear in an\neven-roughly systematic form until well after Austin’s work had\nalready been published, with Bentham’s most systematic discussion only\nappearing posthumously, late in the 20th century (Bentham 1970, 1996;\nCotterrell 2003: p. 50). \n\nAustin’s basic approach was to ascertain what can be said generally,\nbut still with interest, about all laws. Austin’s analysis can be seen\nas either a paradigm of, or a caricature of, analytical philosophy, in\nthat his discussions are dryly full of distinctions, but are thin in\nargument. The modern reader is forced to fill in much of the\nmeta-theoretical, justificatory work, as it cannot be found in the\ntext. Where Austin does articulate his methodology and objective, it\nis a fairly traditional one: he “endeavored to resolve a\nlaw (taken with the largest signification which can be given\nto that term properly) into the necessary and essential\nelements of which it is composed” (Austin 1832: Lecture V,\np. 117). \n\nAs to what is the core nature of law, Austin’s answer is that laws\n(“properly so called”) are commands of a sovereign. He\nclarifies the concept of positive law (that is, man-made law) by\nanalyzing the constituent concepts of his definition, and by\ndistinguishing law from other concepts that are similar: “Commands” involve an expressed wish that something be\ndone, combined with a willingness and ability to impose “an\nevil” if that wish is not complied with. Rules are general commands (applying generally to a class), as\ncontrasted with specific or individual commands (“drink wine\ntoday” or “John Major must drink wine”). Positive law consists of those commands laid down by a sovereign\n(or its agents), to be contrasted to other law-givers, like God’s\ngeneral commands, and the general commands of an employer to an\nemployee. The “sovereign” is defined as a person (or determinate\nbody of persons) who receives habitual obedience from the bulk of the\npopulation, but who does not habitually obey any other (earthly)\nperson or institution.  Austin thought that all independent political\nsocieties, by their nature, have a sovereign. Positive law should also be contrasted with “laws by a close\nanalogy” (which includes positive morality, laws of honor,\ninternational law, customary law, and constitutional law) and\n“laws by remote analogy” (e.g., the laws of physics).  \n (Austin 1832: Lecture I). \n\nAustin also included within “the province of\njurisprudence” certain “exceptions,” items which did\nnot fit his criteria but which should nonetheless be studied with other\n“laws properly so called”: repealing laws, declarative\nlaws, and “imperfect laws”—laws prescribing action\nbut without sanctions (a concept Austin ascribes to “Roman [law]\njurists”) (Austin 1832: Lecture I, p. 36). \n\nIn the criteria set out above, Austin succeeded in delimiting law and\nlegal rules from religion, morality, convention, and custom.  However,\nalso excluded from “the province of jurisprudence” were\ncustomary law (except to the extent that the sovereign had, directly\nor indirectly, adopted such customs as law), public international law,\nand parts of constitutional law. (These exclusions alone would make\nAustin’s theory problematic for most modern readers.) \n\nWithin Austin’s approach, whether something is or is not\n“law” depends on which people have done what: the question\nturns on an empirical investigation, and it is a matter mostly of\npower, not of morality. Of course, Austin is not arguing that law\nshould not be moral, nor is he implying that it rarely is. Austin is\nnot playing the nihilist or the skeptic. He is merely pointing out\nthat there is much that is law that is not moral, and what makes\nsomething law does nothing to guarantee its moral value. “The\nmost pernicious laws, and therefore those which are most opposed to\nthe will of God, have been and are continually enforced as laws by\njudicial tribunals” (Austin 1832: Lecture V, p. 158). \n\nIn contrast to his mentor Bentham, Austin, in his early lectures,\naccepted judicial lawmaking as “highly beneficial and even\nabsolutely necessary” (Austin, 1832: Lecture V,\np. 163). Nor did Austin find any difficulty incorporating judicial\nlawmaking into his command theory: he characterized that form of\nlawmaking, along with the occasional legal/judicial recognition of\ncustoms by judges, as the “tacit commands” of the\nsovereign, the sovereign’s affirming the “orders” by its\nacquiescence (Austin 1832: Lecture 1, pp. 35–36). It should be\nnoted, however, that one of Austin’s later lectures listed the many\nproblems that can come with judicial legislation, and recommended\ncodification of the law instead (Austin 1879: vol. 2, Lecture XXXIX,\npp. 669–704).\n \n\nAs many readers come to Austin’s theory mostly through its criticism\nby other writers (prominently, that of H.L.A. Hart; see also Kelsen\n1941: 54–66), the weaknesses of the theory are almost better known\nthan the theory itself:  First, in many societies, it is hard to identify a\n“sovereign” in Austin’s sense of the word (a difficulty\nAustin himself experienced, when he was forced to describe the British\n“sovereign” awkwardly as the combination of the King, the\nHouse of Lords, and all the electors of the House of\nCommons). Additionally, a focus on a “sovereign” makes it\ndifficult to explain the continuity of legal systems: a new ruler will\nnot come in with the kind of “habit of obedience” that\nAustin sets as a criterion for a system’s rule-maker.  A few responses are available to those who would defend Austin.\nFirst, some commentators have argued that Austin is here\nmisunderstood, in that he always meant “by the sovereign\nthe office or\ninstitution which embodies supreme authority; never the\nindividuals who happen to hold that office or embody that institution\nat any given time” (Cotterrell 2003: p. 63, footnote omitted);\nthere are certainly parts of Austin’s lectures that support this\nreading (e.g., Austin 1832: Lecture V, pp. 128–29; Lecture\nVI, p. 218).   Secondly, one could argue (see Harris 1977) that the sovereign is\nbest understood as a constructive metaphor: that law should be viewed\nas if it reflected the view of a single will (a similar view, that law\nshould be interpreted as if it derived from a single will, can be\nfound in Ronald Dworkin’s work (1986: pp. 176–190)).  Thirdly, one could argue that Austin’s reference to a sovereign\nwhom others are in the habit of obeying but who is not in the habit of\nobeying anyone else, captures what a “realist” or\n“cynic” would call a basic fact of political life.  There\nis, the claim goes, entities or factions in society that are not\neffectively constrained, or could act in an unconstrained way if they\nso chose.  For one type of example, one could point out that if there\nwas a sufficiently large and persistent majority among the United\nStates electorate, nothing could contain them: they could elect\nPresidents and legislators who would amend the Constitution and,\nthrough those same officials, appoint judges who would interpret the\n(revised or original) Constitution in a way amenable to their\ninterests.  A different sort of example (and some would say that there\nare recent real-life examples of this type) would be a President who\nignored the constraints of statutory law, constitutional law, and\ninternational treaty commitments, while the public and other officials\nlacked the will or the means to hold that President to the legal norms\nthat purported to constrain his or her actions.  As regards Austin’s “command” model, it seems to fit\nsome aspects of law poorly (e.g., rules which grant powers to\nofficials and to private citizens—of the latter, the rules for\nmaking wills, trusts, and contracts are examples), while excluding\nother matters (e.g., international law) which we are not inclined to\nexclude from the category “law.”  More generally, it seems more distorting than enlightening to\nreduce all legal rules to one type. For example, rules that empower\npeople to make wills and contracts perhaps can be\nre-characterized as part of a long chain of reasoning for eventually\nimposing a sanction (Austin spoke in this context of the sanction of\n“nullity”) on those who fail to comply with the relevant\nprovisions. However, such a re-characterization misses the basic\npurpose of those sorts of laws—they are arguably about granting\npower and autonomy, not punishing wrongdoing.  A different criticism of Austin’s command theory is that a theory\nwhich portrays law solely in terms of power fails to distinguish rules\nof terror from forms of governance sufficiently just that they are\naccepted as legitimate (or at least as reasons for action) by their\nown citizens.  Finally, one might note that the constitutive rules that determine\nwho the legal officials are and what procedures must be followed in\ncreating new legal rules, “are not commands habitually obeyed,\nnor can they be expressed as habits of obedience to persons”\n(Hart 1958: p. 603).  \n\nAustin was aware of some of these lines of attack, and had responses\nready; it is another matter whether his responses were adequate. It\nshould also be noted that Austin’s work shows a silence on questions\nof methodology, though this may be forgivable, given the early stage\nof jurisprudence. As discussed in an earlier section, in many ways,\nAustin was blazing a new path.  On matters of methodology, later\ncommentators on Austin’s work have had difficulty determining whether\nhe is best understood as making empirical claims about the law or\nconceptual claims; elements of each sort of approach can be found in\nhis writings (Lobban 1991: pp. 224–225; Cotterrell 2003:\npp. 81–83). \n\nWhen H.L.A. Hart revived legal positivism in the middle of the\n20th century (Hart 1958, 1994), he did it by criticizing\nand building on Austin’s theory: for example, Hart’s theory did not\ntry to reduce all legal rules to one kind of rule, but emphasized the\nvarying types and functions of legal rules; and Hart’s theory,\ngrounded partly on the distinction between “obligation”\nand “being obliged,” was built around the fact that some\nparticipants within legal systems “accepted” the legal\nrules as reasons for action, above and beyond the fear of sanctions.\nHart’s “hermeneutic” approach, building on the\n“internal point of view” of participants who accepted the\nlegal system, diverged sharply from Austin’s approach to law. \n\nSome modern commentators appreciate in Austin elements that were\nprobably not foremost in his mind (or that of his contemporary\nreaders). For example, one occasionally sees Austin portrayed as the\nfirst “realist”: in contrast both to the theorists that\ncame before Austin and to some modern writers on law, Austin is seen\nas having a keener sense of the connection of law and power, and the\nimportance of keeping that connection at the forefront of\nanalysis (cf. Cotterrell 2003: pp. 49–77). One commentator wrote: \n\nWhen circumstances seem to warrant a more critical, skeptical or\ncynical approach to law and government, Austin’s equation of law and\nforce will be attractive—however distant such a reading may be\nfrom Austin’s own liberal-utilitarian views at the time of his\nwriting, or his more conservative political views later in his\nlife (Hamburger, 1985).","contact.mail":"bix@umn.edu","contact.domain":"umn.edu"}]
