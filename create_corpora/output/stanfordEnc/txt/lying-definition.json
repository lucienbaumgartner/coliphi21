Questions of the first kind are definitional or conceptual.\nThey include the questions of how lying is to be defined, how\ndeceiving is to be defined, and whether lying is always a form of\ndeceiving.  Questions of the second kind are normative — more\nparticularly, moral.  They include the questions of whether lying and\ndeceiving are either defeasibly or non-defeasibly morally wrong,\nwhether lying is morally worse than deceiving, and whether, if lying\nand deception are defeasibly morally wrong, they are merely morally\noptional on certain occasions, or are sometimes morally obligatory. In\nthis entry, we only consider questions of the first kind.\n\n\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of lying to others. The\ndictionary definition of lying is “to make a false statement\nwith the intention to deceive” (OED 1989) but there are\nnumerous problems with this definition. It is both too narrow, since\nit requires falsity, and too broad, since it allows for lying about\nsomething other than what is being stated, and lying to someone who is\nbelieved to be listening in but who is not being addressed. \n\nThe most widely accepted definition of lying is the following:\n“A lie is a statement made by one who does not believe it with\nthe intention that someone else shall be led to believe it”\n(Isenberg 1973, 248) (cf. “[lying is] making a statement believed\nto be false, with the intention of getting another to accept it as\ntrue” (Primoratz 1984, 54n2)). This definition does not specify\nthe addressee, however. It may be restated as follows: \nL1 is the traditional definition of lying. According to L1, there\nare at least four necessary conditions for lying. First, lying requires\nthat a person make a statement (statement condition). Second, lying\nrequires that the person believe the statement to be false; that is,\nlying requires that the statement be untruthful (untruthfulness\ncondition). Third, lying requires that the untruthful statement be made\nto another person (addressee condition). Fourth, lying requires that\nthe person intend that that other person believe the untruthful\nstatement to be true (intention to deceive the addressee\ncondition). \n\nThese four necessary conditions need to be explained before\nobjections to L1 can be entertained and alternative\ndefinitions can be considered. \n\nAccording to the statement condition, lying requires that a person\nmake a statement. Making a statement requires the use of conventional\nsigns, or symbols. Conventional signs, such as\n“WOMEN” on the door to a restroom, are opposed to natural\nor causal signs, or indices, such as women coming in and out\nof a restroom, as well as signs that signify by resemblance, or\nicons, such as a figure with a triangular dress on the door\nto a restroom (cf. Grotius 2005, 2001; Pierce 1955; Grice\n1989). Making a statement, therefore, requires the use of language. A\ncommonly accepted definition of making a statement is the\nfollowing: “x states that p to y\n=df (1) x believes that there is an expression\nE and a language L such that one of the standard uses\nof E in L is that of expressing the proposition\np; (2) x utters E with the intention of\ncausing y to believe that he, x, intended to utter\nE in that standard use” (Chisholm and Feehan 1977,\n150). \n\nIt is possible for a person to make a statement using American Sign\nLanguage, smoke signals, Morse code, semaphore flags, and so forth, as\nwell as by making specific bodily gestures whose meanings have been\nestablished by convention (e.g., nodding one's head in response to a\nquestion). Hence, it is possible to lie by these means.  If it is\ngranted that a person is not making a statement when he wears\na wig, gives a fake smile, affects a limp, and so forth, it follows\nthat a person cannot be lying by doing these things (Siegler 1966,\n128). If it is granted that a person is not making a\nstatement when, for example, she wears a wedding ring when she is not\nmarried, or wears a police uniform when she is not a police officer,\nit follows that she cannot be lying by doing these things. \n\nIn the case of a person who does not utter a declarative\nsentence, but who curses, or makes an interjection or an\nexclamation, or issues a command or an exhortation, or asks a question,\nor says “Hello,” then, if it is granted that she is\nnot making a statement when she does any of these things, it follows\nthat she cannot be lying by doing these things (Green 2001,\n163–164; but see Leonard 1959). \n\nAn ironic statement, or a statement made as part of a joke, or a\nstatement made by an actor while acting, or a statement made in a\nnovel, is still a statement. More formally, the statement condition of\nL1 obeys the following three constraints (Stokke 2013a, 41): \n\nThe statement condition is to be distinguished from a different\nputative necessary condition for lying, namely, the condition that an\nassertion be made. The assertion\ncondition is not a necessary condition for lying, according to L1. For\nexample, if Yin, who does not have a girlfriend, but who wants people\nto believe that he has a girlfriend, makes the ironic statement\n“Yeah, right, I have a girlfriend” in response to a\nquestion from his friend, Bolin, who believes that Yin is secretly\ndating someone, with the intention that Bolin believe that he actually\ndoes have a girlfriend, then this ‘irony lie’ is a\nlie according to L1, although it is not an assertion. \n\nAccording to the statement condition, it is not possible to lie by\nomitting to make a statement (Mahon 2003; Griffiths 2004, 33).\nSo-called ‘lies of omission’ (or ‘passive\nlying’ (Opie 1825)) are not lies (Douglas 1976, 59; Dynel 2011,\n154). All lies are lies of commission. It is possible for a person to\nlie by remaining ‘silent,’ if the ‘silence’ is\na previously agreed upon signal with others that is equivalent to\nmaking a statement (Fried 1978, 57). However, such a lie would not be a\n‘lie of omission’ (see People v. Meza (1987) in\nwhich, on the basis of Californian Evidence Code that\n“‘Statement’” included “nonverbal conduct\nof a person intended by him as a substitute for oral or written verbal\nexpression,” prospective juror’s Eric Luis Meza’s\nsilence and failure to raise his hand in response to questions was\n“taken for a negative answer, i.e., a negative statement”\n(People v. Meza 1987, 1647) and he was found guilty of\nperjury). \n\nNote that the statement condition, all by itself, does not require\nthat the statement be made to another person, or even that it be\nexpressed aloud or in writing. One’s inner statements to oneself\nare statements, and, if other conditions are also met, can be\n“internal lies” (Kant 1996, 553–554). \n\nAccording to the untruthfulness condition, lying requires that a\nperson make an untruthful statement, that is, make a\nstatement that she believes to be false. Note that this\ncondition is to be distinguished from the putative necessary condition\nfor lying that the statement that the person makes be false\n(Grotius 2005, 1209; Krishna 1961, 146). The falsity condition is not\na necessary condition for lying according to L1. Statements that\nare truthful may be false. If George makes the\nstatement to Hillary (with the intention that Hillary believe that statement\nto be true), “The enemy has weapons of mass destruction,”\nand that statement is false, he is not lying if\nhe does not believe that statement to be false. Statements that are untruthful may be true. In Jean-Paul\nSartre’s short-story, The Wall, set during the Spanish\nCivil War, Pablo Ibbieta, a prisoner sentenced to be executed by the\nFascists, is interrogated by his guards as to the whereabouts of his\ncomrade Ramon Gris. Mistakenly believing Gris to be hiding with his\ncousins, he makes the untruthful statement to them that “Gris is\nhiding in the cemetery” (with the intention that they believe\nthis statement to be true). As it happens, Gris is hiding in the\ncemetery, and the statement is true. Gris is arrested at the cemetery,\nand Ibbieta is released (Sartre 1937; cf. Siegler 1966: 130).\nAccording to L1, Ibbieta lied to his interrogators, although the\nuntruthful statement he made to them was true, and he did not deceive\nthem about the whereabouts of Gris (Isenberg 1973, 248; Mannison 1969,\n138; Lindley, 1971; Kupfer 1982, 104; Faulkner 2013). \n\nIf a person makes a truthful statement with the intention to deceive\nanother person, then she is not lying, according to the untruthfulness\ncondition. For example, if John and Mary are dating, and Valentino is\nMary’s ex-boyfriend, and one evening “John asks Mary,\n‘Have you seen Valentino this week?,’” and\n“Mary answers: ‘Valentino’s been sick with\nmononucleosis for the past two weeks,’” and\n“Valentino has in fact been sick with mononucleosis for the past\ntwo weeks, but it is also the case that Mary had a date with Valentino\nthe night before” (Coleman and Kany 1981, 31), then Mary is not\nlying to John, even if she is attempting to deceive John. This is what\nis called a palter (see Schauer and Zeckhauser 2009; they\nillegitimately add that a palter must succeed in deceiving),\nor a false implicature (Adler 1997), or an attempt to\nmislead (Saul 2012b; Webber 2013). \n\nIn addition to palters not being lies, a double bluff is not\na lie either according to the untruthfulness condition. If one makes a\ntruthful statement, intending one’s addressee to believe that\nthe statement is false, then one is not lying. Consider the following\njoke about two travelers on a train from Moscow (reputed to be Sigmund\nFreud's favorite joke) (Cohen 2002, 328): \nPavel does not lie to Trofim, since his statement to Trofim is\ntruthful, even if he intends that Trofim be deceived by this double\nbluff. \n\nOne implication of the untruthfulness condition is that if a person\nmakes a statement that she believes to be neither true nor false, then\nshe cannot be lying (Siegler 1966, 133; cf. Strawson 1952, 173). For\nexample, if a person begging for money says “All my children need\nmedical attention,” but believes that this proposition is neither\ntrue nor false, because he has no children, then he is not lying, even\nif he is attempting to deceive (Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 155–6; but\nsee Siegler 1966, 135).  It is a matter of debate as to whether it is possible to lie using\nmetaphors. For example, if a gardener who has had a very bad crop of\ntomatoes says “We’ve got tomatoes coming out of our\nears,” intending to deceive about his having a bumper crop, then\nthis untruthful statement made with an intention to deceive is\ntypically not considered a lie, because the untruthful statement is\nmetaphorical (Saul 2012, 16). Nevertheless, some argue that it is\npossible to lie using metaphors (Adler 1997, 444 n. 27; Griffiths\n2004, 36; Dynel 2011, 149).  If literally false metaphorical\nstatements can be truthful statements, according to the beliefs of the\nspeaker, and hence, can be untruthful statements, according to the\nbeliefs of the speaker, then the deceptive gardener is lying in this\nexample according to L1. \n\nAccording to the addressee condition, lying requires that a person\nmake an untruthful statement to another person (or,\nstrictly speaking, to a believed other person, since one\nmight, e.g., mistake a waxed dummy for another person, and lie to it).\nThat is, lying requires that a person address another person\n(Simpson 1992, 626). According to L1, it is not possible for me to lie to\nno one whatsoever (i.e., not even myself), and it is not\npossible to lie to someone whom one is not addressing but whom one\nbelieves is listening in on a conversation. For example, if Mickey and\nDanny both believe that the F.B.I. is monitoring their telephone\nconversation, and Mickey says to Danny, “The pick-up is at\nmidnight tomorrow,” with the intention of deceiving the FBI\nagents listening in, then Mickey is not lying to the F.B.I. agents\n(this is a “bogus disclosure” (Newey 1997, 115)). \n\nAccording to L1, it is possible to lie to a general\naudience. It is possible for a person to lie by publishing an\nuntruthful report about an event (Kant 1997, 203), or by making an\nuntruthful statement on a tax return, or by sending an untruthful\ne-mail to everyone on a mailing list, or by making an untruthful\nstatement in a magazine advertisement or a television commercial. In\nthese cases, the readers, hearers, watchers, etc., are the addressees. \n\nAccording to the addressee condition, lying necessarily involves\naddressing someone whom you believe to be a person capable of\nunderstanding your statement and forming beliefs on that basis. It is\nnot possible to lie to those whom you believe to be non-persons\n(goldfish, dogs, robots, etc.) or persons whom you believe cannot\nunderstand the statements that are made to them (infants, the insane,\netc., as well as those whom you believe cannot understand the language\nyou are speaking in). It is possible to lie to other persons via\nintermediaries which are not persons, however (e.g., entering false\nanswers to questions asked by a bank’s ATM). \n\nAccording to the intention to deceive the addressee condition, lying\nrequires that a person make an untruthful statement to another person\nwith the intention that that other person believe that\nuntruthful statement to be true. Making ironic statements, telling jokes,\nwriting fiction, acting in a play, and so forth, without the\nintention that the addressee believe these untruthful statements to be\ntrue, is not lying (Morris 1976, 391). \n\nIf x makes an untruthful statement to y,\nwithout the intention that y believe that untruthful\nstatement to be true, but with the intention that y\nbelieve something else to be true that x\nbelieves to be true, then x is not lying to\ny, according to L1. Examples of such non-deceptive untruthful\nstatements include polite untruths (Kant 1997, 27; Mahon 2003,\n109). For example, if servant Igor makes the untruthful statement to\nunwelcome visitor Damian, “Madam is not at home,”\nwithout the intention that Damian believe it to be true that\nshe is not home (that would be lying on Igor’s part), but\nwith the intention that Damian believe it to be true that it\nis inconvenient for Madam to see Damian now, something that Igor\nbelieves to be true, then according to L1, Igor is not lying to Damian\n(Isenberg 1973, 256). However, for Igor to intend that Damian believe\nthis, it must be the case that Igor believes that this is how\nDamian understands “Madam is not at home.” Polite untruths\nmay be said to be examples of “falsifications but not\nlies,” since the person “says just what etiquette\ndemands” (Shiffrin 2014, 19). As it has been said about\nuntruthful statements situations “in which politeness requires\nsome sort of remark” and the other person “knows quite well\nthat the statement is false,” such statements “are not\nreally lies” (Coleman and Kay 1981, 29). They are better\nconsidered as cases of speaking in code. Another example of a\nnon-deceptive untruthful statement is what has been called an\n“altruistic lie” (Fallis 2009, 50; cf. Augustine\n1952, 57), such as when a speaker makes an untruthful statement to a\nhearer whom he believes distrusts him, in order that the hearer will\nbelieve something that the speaker believes to be true.\nThis is not a lie according to L1. \n\nSuch non-deceptive untruths are not to be confused with white\nlies, i.e., harmless lies (Bok 1978, 58; Sweetser 1987, 54; 52 n.\n73) or prosocial lies (also called social lies),\ni.e., lies that do not harm social life but protect it (Meibauer 2014,\n152; Sweetser 1987, 54), or fibs, i.e., inconsequential lies\ntold for selfish reasons (Sweetser 1987, 54). White lies, prosocial\nlies, and fibs are all intentionally deceptive, and are all lies\naccording to L1 (Green 2001, 169). For example, “both American\nand Ecuadorian cultures would probably consider Jacobo’s reply\nto be a white lie,” and hence deceptive, in the following case\npresented to Ecuadorians by linguists: “Teresa just bought a new\ndress. Upon trying it on for the first time, she asks her husband\nJacobo, ‘Does it look good on me?’ Jacobo responds,\n‘Yes’ even though he really thinks that the dress is ugly\nand too tight” (Hardin 2010, 3207; cf. Dynel 2011, 160). Or, to\ntake another example, “Some people would call it a white lie to\ntell a dying person whatever he or she needs to hear to die in\npeace” (Sweetser 1987, 54). Note that both white lies and\nprosocial lies are to be distinguished from “lies which most\npeople would think justified by some higher good achieved but which\nwould not be called white lies [or prosocial lies], since their\ninformational consequences are too major (however moral),” such\nas “to lie to the Gestapo about the location of a Jew”\n(Sweetser 1987, 54). \n\nAccording to the untruthfulness condition, it is not merely the case\nthat the person who makes the untruthful statement intends that some\nother person believe the untruthful statement to be true; the person\nintends that the addressee believe the untruthful statement\nto be true. Also, according to this condition, it is not merely the\ncase that the person intends that the addressee believe some statement\nto be true that the person believes to be false; the person intends\nthat the addressee believe to be true the untruthful statement\nthat is made to the addressee. If Maximilian is a crime boss, and\nAlessandro is one of his henchmen, whom he secretly believes is a\npolice informant, and Maximilian makes the untruthful statement to\nAlessandro “There are no informants in my organization,”\nwithout the intention that Alessandro believe that statement to be\ntrue, but with the intention that Alessandro believe that\nMaximilian believes that statement to be true, then\nMaximilian is not lying according to L1 (Mahon 2008, 220). (Maximilian\nhas, of course, attempted to deceive Alessandro). This conclusion has\nprompted some to revise L1 to include more than one intention to\ndeceive. \n\nAccording to the untruthfulness condition, it is sufficient for lying that the\nperson who makes the untruthful statement intends that the\naddressee believe the untruthful statement to be true; it is not\nnecessary that the addressee believe the untruthful statement to be\ntrue. That is, a lie remains a lie if it is disbelieved. If\nSophie makes the untruthful statement to Nicole “I didn’t\nget any homework today,” with the intention that Nicole believe\nthat statement to be true, and if Nicole does not believe that\nstatement to be true, then Sophie is still lying. This is because\n‘lie’ is not an achievement or success verb, and an act of\nlying is not a perlocutionary act. The existence of an act of lying\ndoes not depend upon the production of a particular response or state\nin the addressee (Mannison 1969, 135; Wood 1973: 199; MacCormick 1983,\n9 n. 23; but see Reboul 1994). As it has been said, “It is very\nodd to think that whether a speaker lies\nhinges upon the persuasiveness of the speaker or the credulity\nof the listener” (Shiffrin 2014, 13). \n\nBecause L1 does not have an assertion condition, however, according to\nL1 it is possible to lie by making ironic statements, telling jokes,\nwriting fiction, acting in a play, and so forth, if the person making\nthe untruthful statement (somehow) intends that it be believed to be\ntrue, as in the case of the ‘irony lie’ above. Similarly,\nif someone intends to deceive using a joke—for example, if con\nartist David says “Yeah, I am a billionaire. That's why I am in\nthis dive” to his mark, Greg, at a bar, intending that Greg\nbelieve that David is a billionaire who is attempting to to pass\nincognito in a bar—then this ‘joke lie’ is a lie\naccording to L1. If a novelist were to write a novel with the\nintention that her audience believe that this was a true story\ndisguised as a novel—a pretend roman à \nclef—then this ‘fiction lie’ would be a lie according\nto L1. If an actor in a play were to deliver an untruthful statement\nwith the intention that his audience believe the statement to be \ntrue—say, if an an actor delivered a line about his life being too\nshort with the intention that the audience believed that the actor\nwas actually dying from some disease (“it is possible that the\nperformance is part of an elaborate deception aimed at getting members\nof the audience to believe that the particular line from the play is\nactually true” (Fallis 2009, 56))—then this\n‘acting lie’ would be a lie according to L1.  \n\nTwo kinds of objections have been made to L1. First, objections have\nbeen made to each necessary condition, on the basis that it is not\nnecessary for lying. According to these objections, L1 is too\nnarrow. Second, objections have been made to the four necessary\nconditions being jointly sufficient for lying, on the basis that some\nfurther condition is necessary for lying.  According to these\nobjections, L1 is too broad. \n\nAgainst the statement condition of L1 it has been objected that the\nmaking of a statement is not necessary for lying. Lying to others may\nbe defined as “any form of behavior the function of\nwhich is to provide others with false information or to deprive them of\ntrue information” (Smith 2004, 14), or as “a successful\nor unsuccessful deliberate attempt, without forewarning, to create in\nanother a belief which the communicator considers to be\nuntrue” (Vrij 2000, 6). Importantly, this entails that lying can\nconsist of simply withholding information with the intent to deceive,\nwithout making any statement at all (Ekman 1985, 28; Scott 2006, 4).\nThose who make this objection would make lying the same as\nintentionally deceiving (Ekman 1985, 26). \n\nAgainst the untruthfulness condition of L1 it has been objected that\nan untruthful statement is not necessary for lying. This objection\ncomes in a variety of forms. There are those who argue any statement\nmade with an intention to deceive is a lie, including a truthful\nstatement that is made with an intention to deceive (Barnes 1994, 11;\nDavidson 1980, 88). Lying may thus be defined as “any\nintentionally deceptive message that is stated” (Bok\n1978, 13). There are also those who, relying upon a Gricean account of\nconversational implicature (Grice 1989, 39)), argue that someone who\nmakes a truthful statement but who thereby conversationally implicates\na believed-false statement is lying (Meibauer 2011, 285;\n2014a). Importantly, such an “untruthful implicature”\n(Dynel 2011, 159–160) is “directly intended” (Adler\n1997, 446). Thirdly, there are those who argue for the possibility of\n“lying ironically” (Simpson 1992, 631), or indirect lying.\nIf a speaker makes an ironic untruthful statement, then “Through\nthis presentation of himself as insincerely asserting he presents\nhimself as believing” the opposite of what he says, which is\n“capacity to… assert in-effect” (Simpson 1992,\n630).  If the person is “insincere in this” and actually\ndoes believe in the truth of what he states, despite invoking trust in\nhis believing its opposite, then “this is a lie (an indirect\nlie, we might say)” (Simpson 1992, 630). For example, if a\nperson who is listening to a sappy pop song at a party is asked if she\nlikes this kind of music and replies, ironically, “Yeah, right,\nI love this kind of music,” then she is lying if she actually\ndoes love this kind of music (cf. Dynel 2011,\n148–149). \n\nAgainst the untruthfulness condition it has also been objected that\nit is not necessary for lying that the statement that is made is\nbelieved to be false; it is sufficient that the statement is not\nbelieved to be true, or is believed to be probably false\n(Carson 2006, 298; 2010, 18). As it has been claimed, “Agnostics\nabout the truth of their assertions who nonetheless assert them without\nqualification tell lies” (Shiffrin 2014, 13). \n\nAgainst the addressee condition of L1 it has been objected that it is\nsufficient for lying that the untruthful statement is made, even if it\nis made to no one — not even to oneself (Griffiths 2004,\n31). Lying may thus be defined as “conscious expression of other\nthan what we believe” (Shibles 1985, 33). It has also been\nobjected that it is possible to lie to third parties who are not\naddressees. In general, it is possible to distinguish between cases\nwhere “the hearer eavesdrops, unbeknown to the first\nand second parties” (eavesdropping), cases where\n“the speaker utters p to the interlocutor while the\nhearer, with the awareness of both other parties, listens in and knows\nthat the first- and second-party know he is listening in…\nalthough it is for the interlocutor that the utterance is\nintended” (kibbitzing), as well as cases similar to\nkibbitzing except that “the utterance is also intended for the\nhearer [who knows that they know that he is listening in]”\n(disclosure), and cases similar to disclosure “except\nthat although the first and second parties know that the hearer is\nlistening in, the hearer does not know that they are listening\nin” (bogus disclosure) (Newey 1997, 115). Even if it is\nnot possible to lie to eavesdroppers, or to those merely listening in,\nas in the case of kibbitzing, it may be possible to lie in the cases\nof bogus disclosure, as in the example above of Mickey saying to\nDanny, “The pick-up is at midnight tomorrow,” with the\nintention of deceiving the F.B.I. agents listening in. It may even be\npossible to lie in the case of disclosure. In the 1978 thriller\nCapricorn One about a Mars landing hoax, during a nationally\ntelevised transmission between the astronauts ‘in space’\nand their wives at the control center, which is being monitored\nclosely by NASA handlers, Colonel Charles Brubaker tells his wife Kay\nto tell his son that “When I get back, I’m gonna take him\nto Yosemite again, like last summer.” In fact he brought his son\nto a different place the previous summer (Flatbush, where a movie was\nbeing shot), something that his wife knows. According to this\nobjection, Brubaker is lying to his NASA handlers about\nwhat he did last summer, even if they are not his addressees. \n\nAgainst the addressee condition it has also been objected that it\nis possible to lie to an animal, a robot, etc., as well as to\nwhat might be another person—for example, if a home\nowner, woken up in the middle of the night and wondering if there are\nburglars below the stairs, shouts down, “I’m bringing my rifle\ndown there,” although he has no rifle (Chisholm and Feehan 1977,\n157). \n\nAgainst the intention to deceive the addressee condition of L1 it\nhas been objected that, even if an intention to deceive the addressee\nis required for lying, it is not necessary that it be an intention to\ndeceive the addressee about the content of the untruthful\nstatement; it may be an intention to deceive the addressee about the\nbeliefs of the speaker abut the statement—specifically,\nthe belief that the untruthful statement is true (Chisholm and Feehan\n1977, 152; Williams 2002, 74; Reboul 1994, 294; Mahon 2008, 220;\nTollefsen 2014, 24).  There are at least two ways in which L1 could be modified in\nresponse to this objection. First, it could be held that what is\nessential to lying is the intention to deceive the hearer about the\nspeaker’s belief that the untruthful statement is true:\n“x utters a sentence, ‘S,’ where\n‘S’ means that p, in doing which\neither x expresses his belief that p, or x\nintends the person addressed to take it that x believes\nthat p” (Williams 2002, 74) and “the speaker\nbelieves [p] to be false” (Williams 2002,\n96–97). L1 could therefore be modified as follows: \n\nAlternatively, L1 could be modified to incorporate either intention,\nas follows: \n\nAgainst this condition it has also been argued that it is not\nnecessary that it be an intention to deceive the addressee about either\nthe content of the untruthful statement or about the beliefs of the\nspeaker about the untruthful statement. It is sufficient that there is\nan intention to deceive about some matter—that is, it\nis sufficient that the speaker intend that the hearer believe to be\ntrue something that the speaker believes to be false. Note\nthat those who make this objection would turn lying into any\ndeception involving untruthful statements. If this\nobjection were combined with the objection that lying could be directed\nto third parties (as in bogus disclosure, or disclosure), L1 could be\nmodified, as follows: \n\nAgainst this condition it has also been objected that although there\nis “a necessary relationship between lying and deception,”\nnevertheless this intention should be understood merely as the\nintention to be deceptive to another person, which is the\nintention “to conceal information” from the other\nperson (Lackey 2013, 5–7). According to this objection, concealing\nevidence, understood as hiding evidence or keeping evidence secret,\ncounts as being deceptive to another person. L1 could be modified, as\nfollows: \n\nFinally, against this intention to deceive the addressee condition it\nhas been objected that no intention to deceive is required for lying\n(Shibles 1985, 33; Kemp and Sullivan 1993, 153; Griffiths 2004, 31;\nCarson et al. 1982; Carson 1988; 2006; 2010; Sorensen 2007;\n2010; 2011; Fallis, 2009; 2010; 2012; 2015; Saul, 2012a; 2012b; Stokke\n2013a, 2013b; 2014; Shiffrin 2014). If the sworn-in witness in the\ntrial of a violent criminal goes on the record and gives untruthful\ntestimony—in order, for example, to avoid being killed by the\ndefendant or any of his criminal associates—without any\nintention that that testimony be believed to be true by any person\n(not the jury, the judge, the lawyers, the journalists covering the\ntrial, the people in the gallery, the readers of the newspaper\nreports, etc.), then the witness is still lying (but see Jones\n1986). Such non-deceptive lies are lies according to this objection\n(but see Lackey 2013 for the argument that these lies are\nintentionally deceptive, and Fallis 2015 for the argument that they\nare not intentionally deceptive). \n\nIt has been objected that L1 is not sufficient for lying because it is\nalso necessary that the untruthful statement be false (Coleman and Kay\n1981, 28; OED, 1989; Moore 2000). This is the falsity\ncondition for lying (Grimaltos and Rosell forthcoming, see Other\nInternet Resources). For most objectors the falsity condition\nsupplements L1 and makes this definition of lying even narrower (e.g.,\nColeman and Kay 1981). For other objectors the falsity condition is\npart of a different definition of lying, and makes that definition\nnarrower (Carson 2006, 284; 2010, 17; Saul 2012b, 6). \n\nIt has been objected that L1 is not sufficient for lying because it is\nalso necessary to intend that that other person believe that that\nstatement is believed to be true (Frankfurt 1999, 96; Simpson\n1992, 625; Faulkner 2007, 527). If Harry makes the untruthful\nstatement “I have no change in my pocket” to Michael, but\nHarry does not intend that Michael believe that Harry believes it to\nbe true, then Harry is not lying to Michael, even if Harry intends\nthat Michael believe it to be true (Frankfurt 1986, 85; 1999,\n96). This additional condition would make L1 even narrower, since it\nwould have the result that Maximilian is not lying to Alessandro in\nthe example above. \n\nFinally, it has been objected that L1 is insufficient because lying\nrequires that an untruthful assertion be made, and not merely\nthat an untruthful statement be made. This is the assertion condition\nfor lying. According to this objection, one is not lying when one makes\na deceptive untruthful ironic statement (‘irony lie’), or a\ndeceptive untruthful joke (‘joke lie’), or a deceptive\nuntruthful fiction (‘fiction lie’), or deceptive untruthful\nacting (‘acting life’), since in none of these cases is one\nmaking an assertion. For most objectors the assertion condition\nsupplements L1 and makes L1 even narrower (Chisholm and Feehan\n1977; Fried 1978; Simpson 1992; Williams 2002; Faulkner 2007). For\nothers the assertion condition is part of a different definition of\nlying, and makes that definition narrower (Sorensen 2007;\nFallis 2009; Stokke 2013a). \n\nThe most important objection to L1 is that lying does not require an\nintention to deceive. This has led to a division amongst\nthose writing on the definition of lying. \n\nThere are two positions held by those who write on the definition of\nlying: Deceptionism and Non-Deceptionism (Mahon 2014). The first\ngroup, Deceptionists, hold that an intention to deceive is necessary\nfor lying. Deceptionists may be divided further in turn into Simple\nDeceptionists, who hold that lying requires the making of an\nuntruthful statement with an intention to deceive; Complex\nDeceptionists, who hold that lying requires the making of an\nuntruthful assertion with the intention to deceive by means of a\nbreach of trust or faith; and Moral Deceptionists, who hold that lying\nrequires the making of an untruthful statement with the intention to\ndeceive, as well as the violation of a moral right of another or the\nmoral wronging of another. The second group, Non-Deceptionists, hold\nthat an intention to deceive is not necessary for lying. They see the\ntraditional definition as both incorrect and\ninsufficient. Non-Deceptionists may be further divided into Simple\nNon-Deceptionists, who hold that the making of an untruthful statement\nis sufficient for lying, and Complex Non-Deceptionists, who hold that\na further condition, in addition to making an untruthful statement, is\nrequired for lying. Some Complex Non-Deceptionists hold that lying\nrequires warranting the truth of what is stated, and other Complex\nNon-Deceptionists hold that lying requires the making of an untruthful\nassertion. \n\nSimple Deceptionists include those who defend L1 (Isenberg 1973;\nPrimoratz 1984) as well as those who defend the modified versions of\nthis definition: L2 (Williams 2002), L3 (Mahon 2008), L4 (Newey 1997),\nand L5 (Lackey 2013). For Simple Deceptionists, lying requires the\nmaking of an untruthful statement with an intention to deceive, but it\ndoes not require the making of an assertion or a breach of trust or faith. \n\nComplex Deceptionists hold that, in addition to requiring an intention\nto deceive, lying requires the making of an untruthful\nassertion, as well as (or which therefore entails) a\nbreach of trust or faith. Roderick Chisholm and\nThomas Feehan hold that one is only making an assertion to another\nperson if one makes a statement to another person and one believes\nthat the conditions are such that the other person is\njustified in believing both that one believes\none’s statement to be true and that one intends that\nthe other person believe that one believes one’s\nstatement to be true: “x asserts p to y\n=dfx states p to y and does so under\nconditions which, he believes, justify y in believing that he,\nx, not only accepts p, but also intends to contribute\ncausally to y’s believing that he, x, accepts\np” (Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 152).\n  \n\nA lie is an untruthful assertion, that is, the speaker believes the\nstatement that is made is not true, or is false: In the case of a lie, the speaker is attempting to get the hearer\nto believe a falsehood. Note, however, that this falsehood is not\n(normally) what the speaker is stating. Rather, the falsehood that the\nspeaker is attempting to get the hearer to believe is that the\nspeaker believes the statement to be true. This is the intention\nto deceive in lying (although, strictly speaking, deception is\nforeseen and not intended (“Essentially, under\nthis definition, you are only lying if you expect that you will be\nsuccessful in deceiving someone about what you believe” (Fallis\n2009, 45)). \n\nThe speaker is also attempting to get the hearer to have this false\nbelief about what the speaker believes “in a special\nway—by getting his victim to place his faith in him”\n(Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 149). This is the breach of trust or breach of faith\nin lying: “Lying, unlike the other types of deception, is\nessentially a breach of faith” (Chisholm and Feehan 1977,\n153). Their complete definition of a lie may be stated as follows: \n\nAccording to L6 it not possible to lie if the speaker believes that\nthe conditions are such that the hearer is not justified in\nbelieving that the speaker is making a truthful statement. Kant\nprovides an example in which a thief grabs a victim by the throat and\nasks him where he keeps his money. If the victim were to make the\nuntruthful statement, “I have no money,” Kant says that\nthis is not a lie, “for the other knows that… he\nalso has no right whatever to demand the truth from me” (Kant\n1997, 203; but see Mahon 2009). Chisholm and Feehan hold that the\nvictim is not making an assertion, and hence, is not lying, given that\nthe victim believes that the thief is not justified in believing that\nthe victim is being truthful (Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 154–155; but\nsee Strudler 2009 (cf. Strudler 2005; 2010), for the argument that the\nthief can believe that the victim is credible, even if not trustworthy,\nbecause he is motivated by the threat of violence).  \n\nCharles Fried also holds that lying requires an assertion and a\nbreach of faith, but he rejects L6, arguing that it is possible for the\nvictim to lie to the thief in Kant’s example (Fried 1978, 55 n1).\nAccording to him, making an assertion involves making a statement and\nintending to cause belief in the truth of that statement by giving an\nimplicit “warranty”or an implicit “promise\nor assurance that the statement is true” (Fried 1978, 57). When\none asserts, one intends to “invite belief, and not belief based\non the evidence of the statement so much as on the\nfaith of the statement” (Fried 1978, 56). A lie is an\nuntruthful assertion. The speaker intends to cause belief in the truth\nof a statement that the speaker believes to be false. Hence, a lie\ninvolves an intention to deceive. The speaker also implicitly assures or\npromises the hearer that the statement that is made is true. Hence, the\nspeaker is giving an insincere assurance, or breaking a promise—\n“in lying the promise is made and broken at the same\nmoment”— and every lie involves a\n“breach of trust” (Fried 1978, 67). \n\nFried’s definition of lying may be stated as follows (modified\nto include cases in which speakers only intend to deceive about their\nbeliefs): \n\nDavid Simpson also holds that lying requires an assertion and a\nbreach of faith. In asserting “we present ourselves as believing\nsomething while and through invoking (although not necessarily gaining)\nthe trust of the one” to whom we assert (Simpson 1992, 625). This\n“invocation of trust occurs through an act of ‘open\nsincerity’” according to which “we attempt to\nestablish… both that we believe some proposition and that we\nintend them to realize that we believe it” (Simpson 1992, 625).\nLying is “insincere assertion” in the sense that “the\nasserter’s requisite belief is missing” (Simpson 1992,\n625). This entails that someone who lies aims to deceive in three ways.\nFirst, “we have the intention that someone be in error regarding\nsome matter, as we see the fact of the matter” (Simpson 1992,\n624). This is the “primary deceptive intention” (Simpson\n1992, 624). Second, we intend to deceive the other person\n“regarding our belief regarding that matter… We\ndon’t lie about this belief, but we intend to deceive\nregarding it” (Simpson 1992, 624). We intend that they\nbe deceived, about whatever matter it is, on the basis of their being\ndeceived about our belief in this matter. Finally, someone who lies\n“insincerely invokes trust” (Simpson 1992, 625). We intend\nthat they be deceived about our belief in this matter on the basis of\nthis insincere invocation of trust. Other forms of intended deception\nthat are not lies do not attempt to deceive “by way of a trust\ninvoked through an open sincerity” (Simpson 1992, 626). This is\nwhat makes lies special: “it involves a certain sort of\nbetrayal” (Simpson 1992, 626).  \n\nSince it is possible to lie without having the primary deceptive\nintention, Simpson’s definition needs to be modified\naccordingly: \n\nPaul Faulkner holds that lying necessarily involves telling someone\nsomething, which necessarily involves invoking trust. He distinguishes\nbetween telling and making an assertion, and argues that in certain\ncases the implication of my assertion “is sufficiently clear\nthat I can be said to have told you this” (Faulkner 2013, 3102)\neven if I did not assert this. He defines telling as\nfollows: “x tells y that p if and only if\n(i) x intends that y believe that p, and\n(ii) x intends that y believe that p\nbecause y recognizes that (i)” (Faulkner 2013, 3103). In\ntelling another person something, the speaker intends that the hearer\nbelieve what she is stating or implying, but she intends that the\nhearer believe what she is stating or implying for the reason\nthat “y [the hearer] believes x [the\nspeaker]” (Faulkner 2013, 3102). It follows that tellings\n“operate by invoking an audience’s trust” (Faulkner\n2013, 3103). In lying, the speaker intends that the hearer believe\nwhat she is stating or implying on the basis of trust: “In\nlying, a speaker does not intend his audience accept his lie because\nof independent evidence but intends his audience accept his\nlie because of his telling it. The motivation for presenting\nhis assertion as sincere is to thereby ensure that an audience treats\nhis intention that the audience believe that p as a reason for\nbelieving that p” (Faulkner, 2007, 527) A lie is\nan untruthful telling. The speaker believes that what she asserts or\nimplies is false, she intends that the hearer believe that what she\nstates or implies is true, she intends that the hearer believe that\nshe intends this, and she intends that this be the reason\nthat the hearer believes that what she states or implies is true:\n“x’s utterance U to y is a lie if and\nonly if (i) in uttering U, x tells y\nthat p, and (ii) x believes that p is\nfalse” (Faulkner 2013, 3103). \n\nFaulkner’s definition of lying also needs to be modified to\ninclude cases in which speakers only intend to deceive about their\nbeliefs:  It is an implication of Complex Deceptionist definitions of lying\nthat certain cases of putative lies are not lies because no assertion\nis made. Consider the following case of an (attempted) confidence\ntrick double bluff (Newey 1997, 98). Sarah, with collaborator Charlie,\nwants to play a confidence trick on Andrew. She wants Andrew to buy\nshares in Cadbury.  She decides to deceive Andrew into thinking that\nKraft is planning a takeover bid for Cadbury. Sarah knows that Andrew\ndistrusts her. If she tells him that Kraft is planning a takeover bid\nfor Cadbury, he will not believe her. If she tells him that there is\nno takeover bid, in an (attempted) double bluff, he might believe the\nopposite of what she says, and so be deceived. But this simple double\nbluff is too risky on its own. So Sarah gets Charlie, whom Andrew\ntrusts, to lie to him that Kraft is about to launch a takeover bid for\nCadbury. She also gets Charlie to tell Andrew that she believes that\nit is false that Kraft is about to launch a takeover bid for\nCadbury. Sarah then goes to Andrew, and tells him, “Kraft is\nabout to launch a takeover bid for Cadbury.” She does not intend\nthat Andrew believe that she believes that Kraft is about to launch a\ntakeover bid for Cadbury.  However, she intends that he believe that\nshe is mistaken, and that in fact Kraft is about to launch a takeover\nbid for Cadbury. As a result, he will be deceived. \n\nAccording to L6, L7, L8, and L9, Sarah is not lying, because she is\nnot asserting anything. According to Simpson, for example, Sarah would\nonly be “pretending to invoke trust” (Simpson\n1992, 628), and would not be invoking trust. In such a case, the\nspeaker intends to represent himself as “intending to\nrepresent himself as believing what he does not” (Simpson\n1992, 628). In order to lie, “one must pretend sincerity, but\nalso act on an intention that this sincerity be\naccepted—otherwise one is pretending to lie, and not\nlying” (Simpson 1992, 629). Sarah would be merely pretending to\nlie to Andrew, in order to deceive him. \n\nAnother case of a putative lie that is not a lie according to Complex\nDeceptionist definitions of lying is a triple bluff\n(cf. Faulkner 2007, 527). Imagine an even more devious Pavel, from the\nexample above, telling an openly distrustful Trofim, in response to\nTrofim's question, that he is going to “Pinsk.” He is\nactually going to Minsk, but he answers“Pinsk” in order to\nhave Trofim believe that he is attempting a double bluff. If it works,\nTrofim will respond by telling him “Liar! You say you are going\nto Pinsk in order to make me believe you are going to Minsk. But I\nknow you are going to Pinsk.” According to L6, L7, L8, and L9,\nPavel is not lying to Trofim. He is pretending to attempt to deceive\nhim with a double bluff, in order to actually attempt to deceive him\nwith a triple bluff. At no point is he invoking trust, and breaching\nthat trust. \n\nMoral Deceptionists hold that in addition to making an untruthful\nstatement with an intention to deceive, lying requires the violation\nof a moral right of another, or the moral wronging of another. \n\nAccording to Chisholm and Feehan, every lie is a violation of the\nright of a hearer, since “It is assumed that, if a\nperson x asserts a proposition p to another\nperson y, then y has the right to expect\nthat x himself believes p. And it is assumed\nthat x knows, or at least that he ought to know, that, if he\nasserts p to y, while believing himself\nthat p is not true, then he violates this right\nof y’s” (Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 153,\n[variables have been changed for uniformity]). Nevertheless, it is not\npart of their definition of lying that lying involves the violation of\nthe right of another person.  According to most philosophers, the\nclaim that lying is (either defeasibly or non-defeasibly) morally wrong is\n“a synthetic judgment and not an analytic one” (Kemp and\nSullivan 1993, 153). However, ‘lie’ is considered by some\nphilosophers to be a thick ethical term that it both describes a type\nof action and morally evaluates that type of action negatively\n(Williams 1985, 140). For some philosophers, “the wrongfulness\nof lying is… built into the definition of the term” (Kemp\nand Sullivan 1993, 153). For these philosophers, the claim that lying\nis (either defeasibly or non-defeasibly) morally wrong is a tautology\n(Margolis 1962). \n\nAccording to Hugo Grotius, it is part of the meaning of\n‘lie’ when it is “strictly taken” that it\ninvolves “the Violation of a Real right” of the person lied\nto, namely, “the Freedom of him… to judge” (Grotius\n2005, 1212). One can only lie to someone who possesses this\nright to exercise liberty of judgment. Grotius’s definition of lying\nis therefore as follows (modified accordingly): \n\nAccording to L10, one cannot lie to “Children or\nMadmen,” for example, since they lack the right of liberty of\njudgment (Grotius 2005, 1212). One cannot lie to someone who has given\n“express Consent” to be told untruths, since he has given\nup the right to exercise his liberty of judgment about these matters\n(Grotius 2005, 1214). One cannot lie to someone who by “tacit\nConsent” or presumed consent “founded upon just\nReason” has given up the right to exercise his liberty of\njudgment about some matter, “on account of the Advantage, that he\nshall get by it,” such as when “a Person… comforts\nhis sick Friend, by making him believe what is false,” since\n“no Wrong is done to him that is willing” (Grotius\n2005, 1215–1217). Furthermore, “he who has an absolute Right over\nall the Rights of another,” is not lying when he “makes use\nof that Right, in telling something false, either for his particular\nAdvantage, or for the publick Good” (Grotius 2005, 1216–1218).\nThe right to exercise one’s liberty of judgment can also be taken\naway in cases “When the life of an innocent Person, or something\nequal to it,” is at stake, or when “the Execution of a\ndishonest Act be otherwise prevented” (Grotius 2005, 1221). In\nsuch a case, the person has forfeited his right, and\n“speaking falsely to those—like thieves—to whom\ntruthfulness is not owed cannot be called lying” (Bok 1978,\n14). \n\nAlan Donagan also incorporates moral conditions into his definition\nof lying (modified to include cases in which speakers only intend to\ndeceive about their beliefs): \n\nAccording to L11, it is not possible to lie to “children,\nmadmen, or those whose minds have been impaired by age or\nillness” (Donagan 1977, 89), since they are not fully responsible\nand rational persons. It is also not possible to lie to “a\nwould-be murderer who threatens your life if you will not tell him\nwhere his quarry has gone” (Donagan 1977, 89), and in general\nwhen you are acting under duress in any way (such as a witness in fear\nof his life on the witness stand, or a victim being robbed by a thief),\nsince statements made in such circumstances are not freely made.\n  \n\nIt has been objected that these moral deceptionist definitions are\nunduly narrow and restrictive (Bok 1978). Surely, for example, it is\npossible to lie to a would-be murderer, whether it is impermissible, as\nsome absolutist deontologists maintain (Augustine 1952; Aquinas 1972\n(cf.  MacIntyre 1995b); Kant 1996 (cf. Mahon 2006); Newman 1880; Geach\n1977; Betz 1985; Pruss 1999; Tollefsen 2014), or permissible (i.e.,\neither optional or obligatory), as consequentialists and moderate\ndeontologists maintain (Constant 1964; Mill 1863; Sidgwick 1981; Bok\n1978; MacIntyre 1995a; cf. Kagan 1998). \n\nIt has also been objected that these moral deceptionist definitions\nare morally lax (Kemp and Sullivan 1993, 158–9). By rendering certain\ndeceptive untruthful statements to others as non-lies, they\nmake it permissible to act in a way that would otherwise be open to\nmoral censure. In general, even those philosophers who hold that all\nlies have an inherent negative weight, albeit such that it can be\noverridden, and hence, who hold that lying is defeasibly morally wrong,\ndo not incorporate moral necessary conditions into their definitions of\nlying (Bok 1978; Kupfer 1982; cf. Wiles 1988). \n\nNon-Deceptionists hold that an intention to deceive is not necessary\nfor lying. \nFor Simple Non-Deceptionists (Augustine 1952 (cf. Griffiths 2003, 31);\nAquinas 1952; Shibles 1985), there is nothing more to lying than\nmaking an untruthful statement. According to Aquinas, for example, a\njocose lie is a lie. This position is not defended by contemporary\nphilosophers. \nFor Complex Non-Deceptionists, untruthfulness is not sufficient for\nlying. In order to differentiate lying from telling jokes, being\nironic, acting, etc., a further condition must be met. For some\nComplex Non-Deceptionists, that further condition is warranting the\ntruth of the untruthful statement. For other Complex\nNon-Deceptionists, that condition is making an assertion. \n\nThomas Carson holds that it is possible to lie by making a false and\nuntruthful statement to an addressee without intending to deceive the\naddressee, so long as the statement is made in a context such that one\n“warrants the truth” of the statement (and one does not\nbelieve oneself to be not warranting the truth of the statement), or\none intends to warrant the truth of the statement: \n\nCarson includes the falsity condition in both of his definitions;\nhowever, he is prepared to modify both definitions so that the falsity\ncondition is not required (Carson 2010, 39). He also holds that the\nuntruthfulness condition is not stringent enough, since, if a speaker\nsimply does “not believe” her statement to be true (but\ndoes not believe it to be false), or believes that her statement is\n“probably false” (but does not believe it to be false),\nthen she is lying. \n\nCarson gives two examples of non-deceptive lies: a guilty student who\ntells a college dean that he did not cheat on an examination, without\nintending that the dean believe him (since “he is really\nhard-boiled, he may take pleasure in thinking that the Dean knows he\nis guilty”), because he knows that the dean’s policy is\nnot to punish a student for cheating unless the student admits to\ncheating, and a witness who provides untruthful (and false) testimony\nabout a defendant, where there is a preponderance of evidence against\nthe defendant, without the intention that the testimony be believed by\nanyone, in order to avoid suffering retaliation from the defendant\nand/or his henchmen (Carson 2006, 289; 2010, 21). Neither person is\nlying according to the definitions of lying of Simple Deceptionists\n(L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5) or Complex Deceptionists (L6, L7, L8, and L9)\n(cf. Simpson 1992, 631) or Moral Deceptionists (L10, L11). Both are\nlying according to L12 and L13, because each warrants the truth of his\nstatement, even though neither intends to deceive his addressee. \n\nIt has been argued that the witness and the student do have an\nintention to deceive (Meibauer 2011, 282; 2014a, 105). It has also\nbeen argued that they are being deceptive, even if they lack an\nintention that their untruthful statements be believed to be true\n(Lackey 2013; but see Fallis 2015). However, it has also been argued\nthat they fail to warrant the truth of their statements, and hence\nfail to be lying according to L12 and L13. One argument is that, in\nthe witness example, the statement is coerced, and “Coerced\nspeech acts are not genuinely assertoric” (Leland 2013, 3;\ncf. Kenyon 2010). “In the context of a threat of violent death,\nthe mere fact that he is speaking under oath is not sufficient to\ninstitute an ordinary warranting context” (Leland 2013,\n4). Another argument is that the witness and the student are not\nwarranting the truth of their statements because they believe that\ntheir audiences believe that they are being untruthful. \nCarson has said that “If one warrants the truth of a statement,\nthen one promises or guarantees, ether explicitly or implicitly, that\nwhat one says is true” (Carson 2010, 26) and “Warranting\nthe truth of a statement presupposes that the statement is being used\nto invite or influence belief. It does not make sense for one to\nguarantee the truth of something that one is not inviting or\ninfluencing others to believe” (Carson 2010, 36). The result is\nthat to lie is to breach trust: “To lie, on my view,\nis to invite others to trust and rely on what one says by warranting\nits truth, but, at the same time, to betray that trust by making false\nstatements that one does not believe” (Carson 2010, 34). The\ncombination of warranting the truth of one’s statement and\nbreaching trust would appear to make Carson’s definition of\nlying similar to that of Complex Deceptionists such as Chisholm and\nFeehan. It would also appear to produce similar results. For example,\nCarson says the following about negotiators: If a negotiator makes an untruthful statement, “That is the\nhighest I can go,” to another negotiator, then, since the\nnegotiator believes that the other negotiator believes that he is\nmaking an untruthful statement, he cannot intend to warrant the truth\nof his statement, and/or the context (of negotiation) is such that he\nis not warranting the truth of his statement. As a result, he is is\nnot lying, according to L12. He is not lying according to L13, either,\nat least if it is true that you cannot “intend to do something\nthat you do not expect to succeed at” (Fallis 2009, 43 n 48;\ncf. Newey 1997, 96–97). \nIt seems that the same thing can be said about the student and the\nwitness. If the student believes that the dean already knows he is\nguilty, and if the witness believes that the jury, etc., already knows\nthat the defendant is guilty, then it seems that neither can intend to\nwarrant the truth of his statement, and/or the context is such that\nneither is warranting the truth of his statement. If this is so, then\nneither is lying according to L12 and L13. Carson has said, about\ntheir Complex Deceptionist definition of lying, “Chisholm and\nFeehan’s definition has the very odd and unacceptable result\nthat a notoriously dishonest person cannot lie to people who he knows\ndistrust him” (Carson 2010, 23). It does seem, however, that\nCarson’s definition has the same result. Jennifer Saul also holds that it is possible to lie without\nintending to deceive. She has provided a modified version of L12 that\ncombines the warranting context condition, and the not believing that\none is not warranting condition, in the single condition of\nbelieving that one is in a warranting context: According to Saul, it is not possible to lie if one does not\nbelieve that one is in a warranting context. Saul considers the case\nof a putative lie told in a totalitarian state: “This is the\ncase of utterances demanded by a totalitarian state. These utterances\nof sentences supporting the state are made by people who don’t\nbelieve them, to people who don’t believe them. Everyone knows\nthat false things are being said, and that they are only being said\nonly because they are required by the state. […] It seems\nsomewhat reasonable to suggest that, since everyone is forced to make\nthese false utterances, and everyone knows they are false, they cease\nto be genuine lies” (Saul 2012, 9). Saul adds that “People\nliving in a totalitarian state, making pro-state utterances, are a\ntrickier case (which they should be). Whether or not their utterances\nare made in contexts where a warrant of truth is present is not at all\nclear” (Saul 2012, 11). If a speaker is making an untruthful\nstatement to a hearer, and “Everyone knows that false things are\nbeing said,” that is, the speaker knows that the hearer knows\nthat the speaker is being untruthful, then the speaker does not\nbelieve that she is in a warranting context. According to L14, the\nspeaker is not lying. However, it is arguable that in both the student\nand the witness cases, “Everyone knows that false things are\nbeing said,” and hence, that the speaker does not believe that\nhe is in a warranting context. If this is so, then according to L14,\nneither the student nor the witness is lying. Roy Sorensen agrees with Carson that lying does not require an\nintention to deceive, and that there can be non-deceptive\n“bald-faced” lies (Sorensen 2007) and\n“knowledge-lies” (Sorensen 2010). However, he rejects L12,\nsince it entails that one cannot lie when the falsity of what one is\nstating is common knowledge: “Carson’s definition of lying\ndoes not relieve the narrowness. The concept of warrant is not broad\nenough to explain how we can lie in the face of common knowledge. One\ncan warrant p only if p might be the case. When the\nfalsehood of p is common knowledge, no party to the common\nknowledge can warrant p because p is epistemically\nimpossible” (Carson 2007, 254). According to Sorensen, a\nnegotiator who tells “a falsehood that will lead to better\ncoordination between buyer and seller” is telling a\nbald-faced lie (Sorensen 2007, 262). Sorensen defines lying as follows: “Lying is just asserting\nwhat one does not believe” (Sorensen 2007, 256). It is a\ncondition on telling a lie that one makes an assertion. Sorensen\ndifferentiates between assertions and non-assertions according to\n“narrow plausibility”: “To qualify as an assertion,\na lie must have narrow plausibility. Thus, someone who only had access\nto the assertion might believe it. This is the grain of truth behind\n‘Lying requires the intention to deceive.’ Bald-faced lies\nshow that assertions do not need to meet a requirement of wide\nplausibility, that is, credibility relative to one’s total\nevidence” (Sorensen 2007, 255). Sorensen provides, as examples of assertions, and hence, lies, the\nservant of a maestro telling an unwanted female caller that the sounds\nshe hears over the phone are not the maestro and that the servant is\nmerely “dusting the piano keys,” and a doctor in an Iraqi\nhospital during the Iraq war telling a journalist who can see patients\nin the ward in uniforms that “I see no uniforms” (Sorensen\n2007, 253). The claim that these are assertions, however, and\ntherefore lies, is controversial (cf. Keiser 2015). These statements\nneither express the speaker’s belief, nor aim to affect the\nbelief of the addressee in any way, since their falsehood is common\nknowledge (cf. Williams 2002, 74). As it has been said:\n“Sorensen does not offer a definition of asserting a proposition\n(with necessary and sufficient conditions)… To the extent that\nhe does not fully analyze the concept of assertion, Sorensen’s\ndefinition of lying is unclear” (Carson 2010, 36). It may be\nargued against Sorensen that the “utterances in question are not\nassertions” (Keiser 2015, 12), and hence, on his own account, fail to\nbe lies. Don Fallis also holds that it is possible to lie without intending\nto deceive. He has also defended the assertion condition for lying:\n“you lie when you assert something that you believe to\nbe false” (Fallis 2009, 33). He has held that you assert\nsomething when you you make a statement and you believe that you are in\na situation in which the Gricean norm of conversation, ‘Do not\nsay what you believe to be false,’ is in effect. His definition\nof lying was thus as follows: Counterexamples to this definition\n(Pruss 2012; Faulkner 2013; Stokke 2013a) have prompted a revision of\nthis definition in order to accommodate these counterexamples: \n\nBoth L15 and L16 are able to accommodate the following\ncounterexample to the earlier definition: “when Marc Antony said\nto the Roman people, ‘Brutus is an honorable man’ …\nthe citizens of Rome know that (a) Antony did not believe that Brutus\nwas an honorable man, that (b) Antony was subject to a norm against\nsaying things that he believed to be false, and that (c) Antony had\nbeen a cooperative participant in the conversation so far. Thus, they\nwere led to conclude that Antony was flouting the norm in\norder to communicate something other than what he literally uttered. In\nfact, the best explanation of his statement was that he wanted to\ncommunicate the exact opposite of what he literally uttered”\n(Fallis 2012, 567). Since Antony does not intend to violate the norm of\nconversation against communicating something that he believes to be\nfalse (that Brutus is an honorable man) by saying “Brutus is an\nhonorable man,” or, more simply, since Antony does not intend to\ncommunicate something false with his untruthful statement, it follows\nthat Antony is not lying. However, in the case of a guilty witness,\nTony, against whom there is overwhelming evidence, who says “I\ndid not do it,” without the intention that anyone believe him, he\ndoes intend to violate the norm of conversation against communicating\nsomething that he believes to be false (that he did not do it) by\nsaying “I did not do it,” or, more simply, he does intend\nto communicate something believed-false with his untruthful statement,\neven though he does not intend that anyone believe this. \n\nIt has been contended that non-deceptive liars do not intend to\ncommunicate anything believed-false with their untruthful statements,\nand, indeed, may even intend to communicate something believed-true\nwith their untruthful statements (Dynel 2011, 151). Fallis rejects the\nclaim that non-deceptive liars do not intend to communicate anything\nbelieved-false, even if they intend to communicate something\nbelieved-true: However, in the case of polite untruths, such as “Madam is\nnot at home,” the untruthful statement is simply a euphemism:\n“For example, the words ”She is not at home,“\ndelivered by a servant or a relative at the door, have become a mere\neuphemism for indisposition or disinclination” (Isenberg 1973,\n256). In the case of polite untruths, it seems, there is no intention\nto communicate anything believed-false. In the case of the servant who\ntells the female caller, “I’m dusting the piano\nkeys,” or the Iraqi doctor who tells the journalist “I see\nno uniforms,” or the negotiator who tells the other negotiator\n“That is the highest I can go,” or the person living in\nthe totalitarian state who makes the pro-state utterance, it is also\narguable that there is no intention to communicate anything\nbelieved-false. If this is true, then there is some support for the\nclaim that non-deceptive liars do not intend to communicate anything\nbelieved-false with their untruthful statements, and hence, that they\nare not lying according to L15 or L16. \n\nAndreas Stokke also holds that it is possible to lie without\nintending to deceive. He has also defended the assertion condition for\nlying: “you lie when you assert something you believe to be\nfalse” (Stokke 2013a, 33). According to Stokke, to “assert\nthat p is to say that p and thereby propose that\np become common ground” (Stokke 2013a, 47). A\nproposition, p, becomes common ground in a group “if all\nmembers accept (for the purpose of the conversation) that p,\nand all believe that all believe that all accept that p,\netc.” (Stokke 2013a, 49, quoting Stalnaker 2002, 716). Stokke thus\ndefines lying as follows: In the case of a speaker making an ironic untruthful statement,\nthe speaker does not propose that the believed-false proposition\n(e.g., “Brutus is an honorable man”) become common ground\n(Stokke 2013a, 50). However, in the case of a non-deceptive liar, the\nspeaker does propose that the believed-false proposition (e.g.,\n“I did not cheat”) become common ground (Stokke 2013a,\n52). The fact that in the case of a non-deceptive lie it is common\nknowledge that what the speaker is saying is (believed to be) false\ndoes not alter the fact that the speaker is proposing that the\nbelieved-falsehood become common ground. Indeed, even if the\n(believed) truth is initially common ground, before the speaker\nproposes that the believed-falsehood become common ground, it is still\nthe case that the non-deceptive liar is proposing to “update the\ncommon ground with her utterance” (Stokke 2013a, 54). For\nexample, in the case of the student and the dean, “The student\nwants herself and the Dean to mutually accept that she did not\nplagiarize” (Stokke 2013a, 54). It is possible to argue that Stokke’s account of assertion,\nand hence L17, is faced with a dilemma when it comes to non-deceptive\nlies. Either, in the case of a non-deceptive lie, the speaker does\npropose that the believed-false proposition become common ground, but\nbecoming common ground is too weak to count as asserting, or becoming\ncommon ground is strong enough to count as asserting, but, in the case\nof a non-deceptive lie, the speaker does not propose that the\nbelieved-false proposition become common ground. Stokke considers\nStalnaker’s example of a guest at a party saying to another\nguest, “The man drinking a martini is a philosopher,” and\nof the two guests proceeding to talk about the philosopher, when it is\ncommon knowledge that the drink in question is not a martini. About\nthis example Stalnaker says: “perhaps it is mutually recognized\nthat it is not a martini, but mutually recognized that both parties\nare accepting that it is a martini. The pretense will be\nrational if accepting the false presupposition is an efficient way to\ncommunicate something true” (Stalnaker 2002, 718). However, if\nproposing that a believed-false proposition become common ground can\nmean engaging in and sustaining a “pretence,” possibly in\norder to communicate truths, then it is not clear that this counts as\nmaking an assertion (cf. Keiser 2015). Hence, a non-deceptive liar may\nbe proposing that her believed-false proposition become common ground\nwithout this being an act of making an assertion. But this means that\nshe is not lying, according to L17. Alternatively, if proposing that a\nbelieved-false proposition become common ground means something more\nthan this, such that the speaker intends or wants herself and her\nhearer “to mutually accept” her believed-false\nproposition, then it is not clear that a non-deceptive liar intends or\nwants this. If this is correct, then non-deceptive lies fail to be\nlies according to L17.  \n\nThe dictionary definition of deception is as follows: “To cause\nto believe what is false” (OED 1989). There are several\nproblems with this definition, however (Barnes 1997; Mahon 2007;\nCarson 2010). The principal problem is that it is too broad in\nscope. On this definition, mere appearances can deceive, such as when\na white object looks red in a certain light (Faulkner,\n2013). Furthermore, it is possible for people\nto inadvertently deceive others. If Steffi believes that\nthere is a talk on David Lewis and the Christians on Friday, and she\ntells Paul that “There is a talk on Lewis and the Christians on\nFriday,” and as a result Paul believes that there is a talk on\nC. S. Lewis and the Christians on Friday, then Steffi has deceived\nPaul. Also, it is possible for people to mistakenly deceive\nother people. If Steffi mistakenly believes that there is not a\nphilosophy talk on Friday, and she tells Paul that there is not a\nphilosophy talk on Friday, and he believes her, then then Steffi has\ndeceived Paul. \n\nAlthough some philosophers hold that deceiving may be inadvertent or\nmistaken (Demos 1960; Fuller 1976; Chisholm and Feehan 1977; Adler\n1997; Gert 2005), many philosophers have argued that it is not possible\nto deceive inadvertently or mistakenly (Linsky 1970; van Horne\n1981; Barnes 1997; Carson 2010; Saul 2012; Faulkner 2013). They\nhold that deception, like lying, is intentional. They reserve\nterm “mislead” to cover cases of causing false beliefs\neither intentionally or unintentionally (Carson 2010, 47). \n\nA modified version of the dictionary definition that does not allow\nfor either inadvertent or mistaken deceiving is as follows: \nD1 may be taken as the traditional definition of deception, at least\nin the case of other-deception (Baron 1988, 444 n. 2). As contrasted\nwith ‘lying,’ ‘deceive’ is an achievement or\nsuccess verb (Ryle 1949, 130). An act of deceiving is not an act of\ndeceiving unless a particular result is achieved. According to D1,\nthat result is a false belief. Note that D1 is not restricted\nto the deception of other persons by other persons; it applies to\nanything that is capable of having beliefs, such as (possibly)\nchimpanzees, dogs, and infants. \n\nThere is no statement condition for deception. In addition to\ndeceiving by means of lying, it is possible to deceive using natural\nor causal signs (indices), such as packing a bag as though one were\ngoing on a holiday, in order to catch a thief (Kant 1997, 202). It is\npossible to deceive by using signs that work by resemblance (icons),\nfor example by posting a smiley face emoticon about a news item that\none is actually unhappy about. Finally, it is possible to deceive by\nnon-linguistic conventional signs (symbols), such as wearing a wedding\nring when one is not married, or wearing a police uniform when one is\nnot a police officer. It is also possible for a person to deceive by\ncursing, making an interjection or an exclamation, issuing a command\nor an exhortation, asking a question, saying “Hello,” and\nso forth. It is also possible to deceive by omitting to make certain\nstatements, or by remaining silent. \n\nThere is also no untruthfulness condition for deception. It is\npossible to deceive by making a truthful and true statement that\nintentionally implies a falsehood. This is a palter. Palters include\nBill Clinton stating “There is no improper relationship,”\nwith the intention that it be believed that there was never an\nimproper relationship (Saul 2012, 30), greeting a famous person by his\nor her first name with the intention that other people believe that you\nare a close friend of his, or making a reservation for a restaurant or a hotel\nas “Dr.,” intending to be believed to be a (typically\nwealthier) physician rather than a (typically less wealthy) academic\n(Schauer and Zeckhauser 2009, 44). If Pavel truthfully and truly tells\nTrofim that he is going to Pinsk, with the intention that the\ndistrustful Trofim believe falsely that Pavel is going to Minsk, and as\na result Trofim believes falsely that Pavel is going to Minsk, then\nPavel deceives Trofim (a double bluff). It is also possible to\ndeceive using truthful statements that are not assertions, such as\njokes, ironic statements, and even the lines of a play delivered on\nstage, so long as the intention to deceive can be formed. If, for\nexample, I am asked if I stole the money, and I reply in an ironic\ntone, “Yeah, right, of course I did,” when I did steal the\nmoney, intending that I be believed to have not stolen the money, and\nif I am believed, then I have deceived using a truthful statement (it\nis unclear if such cases of “telling the truth falsely”\n(Frank 2009, 57) are to be considered as cases of paltering). \n\nThere is also no addressee condition for deception. In addition to\ndeceiving addressees, it is possible to deceive those listening in, as\nin a bogus disclosure (e.g., deceiving F.B.I. agents secretly known to\nbe listening in on a telephone conversation) or a disclosure (e.g.,\ndeceiving NASA handlers openly listening to exchanges between\nastronauts and their wives in Capricorn One). It is also\npossible to deceive an addressee about some matter other than the\ncontent of the statement made (e.g., making a truthful statement, but\nfaking an accent). \n\nSeveral objections can be made to D1. One objection is that it is not\nnecessary that the deceiver causes another person to have a false\nbelief that is (truly) believed to be false by the deceiver: “if\nI intentionally cause you to believe that p where p is\nfalse and I neither believe that p is true nor believe\nthat p is false” (Carson 2010, 48) then this is still\ndeception (van Frassen 1988; Barnes 1997; cf. Shiffrin 2014, 13). For\nexample, if Michael has no belief whatsoever regarding the condition\nof the bridge, but he convinces Gertrude that the bridge is safe, and\nthe bridge happens to be dangerous, then Michael deceives Gertrude\nabout the bridge being safe (van Frassen 1988, 124). Or, if Alyce\nplaces a fake rabbit in Evelyn’s garden, in which lives a\nreclusive rabbit, in order to guarantee that Evelyn believes that she\nis seeing a rabbit in her garden (one way or the other), and Evelyn\nsees the fake rabbit, and calls Alyce on the phone and tells her\n“I am looking at a rabbit in my garden!” then Alyce has\ndeceived Evelyn, even though she cannot believe or know that Evelyn is\nseeing the fake rabbit rather than the real rabbit (Barnes 1997,\n11). Although this objection to D1 is not necessarily compelling\n(Mahon 2007, 191–2), a modified definition of interpersonal\ndeception that incorporates this objection is as follows: \n\nThe most common objection to D1 is that it is not necessary that the\ndeceiver intentionally cause another person to have a new\nfalse belief. Although this form of deception, according to which a\nperson intentionally brings about “the change from the state of\nnot being deceived… to that of being deceived” (Chisholm\nand Feehan 1977, 144), is the most normal form of deception, it is not\nthe only form. A person may deceive another person by causing that\nperson to continue to have a false belief (Fuller 1976, 21;\nChisholm and Feehan 1977, 144; Mahon 2007 189–190; Carson 2010, 50;\nShiffrin 2014, 19). This is where, “but for the act” of the\ndeceiver, the person “would have lost or given up” the\nfalse belief (Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 144), or least have a greater\nchance of losing the false belief. A modified definition of\ninterpersonal deception that incorporates this objection is the\nfollowing: \n\nA further objection to D1 (and D2 and D3) is that it is not sufficient\nfor deception that a person intentionally causes another person to\nhave a false belief that she truly believes or knows to be false; it\nmust also be that this false belief is caused by evidence,\nand that the evidence is brought about by the person in order\nto cause the other person to have the false belief (Linsky 1970, 163;\nFuller 1976, 23; Schmitt 1988, 185; Barnes 1997, 14; Mahon 2007). If\nAndrew intentionally causes Ben to believe (falsely) that there are\nvampires in England by, for example, operating on Ben’s brain,\nor giving Ben an electric shock, or drugging Ben, then Andrew does\nnot deceive Ben about there being vampires in England. Also, if Andrew\ncauses Ben to believe falsely that there are vampires in England by\ngetting Ben to read a book that purports to demonstrate that there are\nvampires in England, then Andrew does not deceive Ben about there\nbeing vampires in England.  However, if Andrew writes a book that\npurports to demonstrate that there are vampires in England, and Ben\nreads the book, and as a result Ben comes to believe that there are\nvampires in England, then Andrew does deceive Ben about there being\nvampires in England (Fuller 1976). A modified definition of\ninterpersonal deception that incorporates this objection is the\nfollowing: \n\nAll of the definitions so far considered are definitions of positive\ndeception, where a person “has been caused to add\nto his stock of false beliefs” or has been caused to continue to\nhave a false belief (Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 144). A further\nobjection to D1 (and D2, D3, and D4) is that it is not necessary for\ndeception to cause a new belief or to cause to continue to have a false\nbelief. One can deceive another person by causing the person to\ncease to have a true belief, or by preventing the person\nfrom acquiring a true belief. These are both cases of negative\ndeception, according to which a person “has been caused to\nlose one of his true beliefs” or been prevented from\ngaining a true belief (Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 143–144). For\nexample, if I intentionally distract someone who is prone to\nforgetting things irretrievably when distracted, in order to make that\nperson forget something irretrievably, and, as a result, that person\nloses a (veridical) memory irretrievably, then I have caused him to\ncease to have a true belief. (In science-fiction the same result can\nbe achieved by using a memory-erasing device, as in the neuralyzer\nused in the 1997 science-fiction film Men in Black). Also, if\nI hide a section of the newspaper from someone in order to prevent her\nfrom learning about some news item, such as an earthquake in a foreign\ncountry that harmed no-one, then I prevented her from acquiring a true\nbelief about a distant earthquake. A modified definition of\ninterpersonal deception that incorporates this objection is the\nfollowing: \n\nHowever, this objection to D1 (and D2, D3, and D4) is not\nnecessarily compelling. It may be argued that negative deception is not\ndeception at all. After all, no false belief has been acquired or sustained.\nIt may be argued that to prevent someone from acquiring a true belief\nis to keep that person in ignorance, or to keep that person “in\nthe dark,” rather than to deceive that person (Mahon 2007,\n187–188; cf. Carson 2010, 53). The state of being ignorant is not the\nsame as the state of being mistaken. One may not know what city is the\ncapital city of Estonia (Tallinn); this is different from mistakenly\nbelieving that Riga is the capital city of Estonia. Similarly, although\nit is more unusual, rendering a person ignorant of some matter is not\nthe same as deceiving that person, at least if it results in no false\nbelief. For example, in the 2004 science-fiction film The Eternal\nSunshine of the Spotless Mind, people go to Lacuna, Inc., to have\ntheir memories of their previous relationships, as well as their visits, erased.\nThose who run Lacuna, Inc., make their clients forget things, or render\nthem ignorant of things. They do not deceive them in doing this.\nChisholm and Feehan admit that Augustine and Aquinas “do not call\nit ‘deception’” to “hide the truth”\n(Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 187). \n\nD5 only counts as deception cases of deception “by\ncommission” (Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 143–144). According\nto Chisholm and Feehan, it is also possible to deceive “by\nomission” (Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 143–144). One may\nallow a person to acquire a false belief, or allow a\nperson to continue with a false belief, or allow a person to\ncease to have a true belief, or allow a person to continue\nwithout a true belief. For example, one may allow a person to read a\nnews story and acquire a belief that one knows is false (e.g., a news\nstory about the CEO of your company resigning for health reasons, when\nyou know he was forced out for mismanagement of funds), and one may\nallow a person to continue to have a false belief by not correcting\nthe person’s false belief (e.g., not correcting a child’s\nbelief in Santa Claus). Or, for example, one may allow a person to\nforget a veridical memory by not stopping them from getting\ndistracted, and one may allow a person to continue without knowing\nabout an earthquake that has occurred in a foreign country. According\nto Chisholm and Feehan, there can positive and negative deception by\ncommission and by omission. A modified definition of interpersonal\ndeception that incorporates this objection is the following: \n\nFinally, D6 only counts as deception actions and omissions that are\nintentional. According to Chisholm and Feehan, however, deception can\nbe unintentional. A modified definition of interpersonal deception that\nincorporates this objection is the following: The objection to D5 that negative deception is not\ndeception also applies to D6 and D7.","contact.mail":"james.mahon@lehman.cuny.edu","contact.domain":"lehman.cuny.edu"}]
