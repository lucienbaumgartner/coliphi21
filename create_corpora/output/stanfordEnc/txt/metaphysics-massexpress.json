After a child destroys her sandcastle, there is one\nless thing in the world, but no less sand. One can count cakes, but\nnot cake. Split a large portion of water in half and you will be left\nwith what you started with—water. Split a computer monitor in\nhalf and you will not be left with a monitor or monitors. \n\nThese examples point to a ubiquitous but elusive conceptual\ndistinction between stuff and things. Paradigmatic\nexamples of stuffs are wood, water, hydrogen, and iron. Less\nparadigmatic stuffs include beer, salsa, and butter. The most general\nphysical stuff-kind is matter. The concept of stuff is even\nmore general than matter. Concepts such as ectoplasm,\njustification, or phlogiston may refer to spiritual or abstract\nstuff. ‘Things’ or ‘objects’ refer, most\nparadigmatically, to medium-sized entities such as tables and ladles,\npears and bears, and locks and socks. \n\nPhilosophical explorations of the distinction have generated a\nnumber of interesting questions in philosophy of language and\nmetaphysics. The linguistic distinction between what are\ncalled mass expressions (e.g., ‘lead’, ‘the\nwater in the tub’) and count expressions (e.g.,\n‘two horses,’ ‘the horse in the barn’) is\nbelieved to be important in examining the metaphysical stuff/thing\ndistinction. In this entry we will be more concerned with nominal mass\nexpressions (e.g., ‘the water in the tub’, ‘the gold\nin his teeth’), as opposed to predicative mass expressions\n(e.g., ‘the statue is lead’). Some main questions in this\narea include: Are things illusory, the world consisting, most\nfundamentally, of stuff alone? Or is stuff just a certain kind of\nthing or things? Is all talk of physical kinds of stuff only about\nconcrete portions of matter, or is it also (or instead) about\nuniversals? Is there a stuff quantifier in addition to the standard\none?\n\nThe present essay articulates the foregoing questions, and surveys\nvarious answers to them. In particular, we will survey different\nanswers to the following, which is our main target question: What do\nnominal mass expressions refer to? \n\nIn the literature, rather than mass and count expressions,\nthere has been a tendency to focus on what are called mass and\ncount nouns. Mass nouns\ninclude nitrogen, porridge, trash, \nchina, traffic, data, shade,\nmusic and furniture. Count nouns\ninclude horse, futon, army, codicil,\nproposition, and galaxy. It should be noted from the\noutset that the relation between the mass/count distinction and the\nstuff/thing distinction is not straightforward, as there are so many\ndifferent kinds of entities (e.g., events, concreta, sets, processes,\nabsences, conventional entities, etc.) referred to by both mass and\ncount expressions.  \nMass expression is a broader class, which, in addition to\nmass nouns, includes phrases such as ‘the water in the\ntub’, ‘the gold in France,’ and ‘the grape\njuice Roderick drank.’ Similarly, ‘Robert’s car’,\n‘John’s student,’ ‘a NATO signatory’ are count\nexpressions. \nThere is an issue, orthogonal to our discussion, about whether\nexpression -types or expression-instances are what\nare primarily mass or count. Many hold that mass expressions are\nambiguous between mass or count senses depending upon context\n(e.g., ‘Mary had a little lamb’ could mean she owned one,\nor ate some (Quine 1960, p. 91)). This question can be\nside-stepped by stipulating, in what follows, that the phrases\n‘mass nouns,’ ‘mass terms,’ and ‘mass\nexpressions’ will mean “noun/term/expression occurrences\nemployed with a mass sense” (see Pelletier 1975 and Koslicki\n1999, section II, for details on this issue). \nMass and count nouns act differently in relation to quantifiers and\nnon-logical determiners. Count nouns, but not mass nouns (when not\nused in the kind sense), can be prefaced by ‘each’,\n‘every’, ‘few’, ‘fewer’,\n‘many’, and ‘a’. Mass nouns, but not count\nnouns, can be prefaced by ‘much’, ‘little’,\n‘a lot of’, ‘less’, ‘more’,\n‘a quantity of’, and so on. Both mass and count nouns take\n‘most’, ‘all’, ‘some’,\n‘no’, ‘none of the’, ‘any’,\n‘hardly any’, and ‘a little’.  \nOnly count nouns can be prefaced unqualifiedly by numerals or the\nindefinite article, and be pluralized without a category shift. When\nwe switch from speaking of ‘a horse’ to ‘five\nhorses’ we have not switched from speaking of things to speaking\nof kinds of things. However, when we switch from speaking of\n‘wine’ to ‘a wine’ or ‘seven\nwines’, we usually switch from speaking about wine, or portions\nof it, to speaking about kinds of wine (Pelletier\n1974). (Compare ‘The wine is over there’ to ‘Gallo\nsells seven wines.’) While we do say things like “We’ll\nhave six beers,” or “I need five milks for the\nchildren,” these are understood, depending on context, as\nshorthand for ‘six bottles/kegs of beer,’ or ‘six\ncartons/pints of milk.’ If you pour a glass of wine on the floor\nyou cannot, if grammar is your guide, count the number of\n‘wines’ (in the non-kind sense) on the floor. There are no\nthings (or at least no commonsense things) which are wines, such that\nthere are a number of them on the floor.  \nWhile mass nouns do not admit the indefinite article, they admit a use\nof ‘some’ which acts like an indefinite article\n(Cartwright 1965). We can say, for example, “Adam drank some\nwater which is worse than Onondaga Lake water,” or,\n“Heraclitus bathed in some water yesterday and bathed in it\nagain today.”  \nBoth count and mass nouns admit the definite article. There are\nsentence forms with a mass noun prefaced by the definite article, such\nas “Socrates drank the hemlock in that cup,” “Bob\njust wrote your name in the snow over there.” These sentences, if\ntrue, will be cases of definite reference of mass expressions, in that\nthey pick out an actual, unique, and concrete referent. Both mass and\ncount nouns admit definite reference. But, it is controversial whether\ndefinite reference to stuff is singular\nreference.  \nFor our purposes, it is useful to lay down a limited taxonomy of mass\nnouns, not based on their linguistic, logical, or semantic features,\nbut based upon prima facie salient metaphysical\ncriteria. Compare the following lists:  \n(a) are definitely mass by the grammatical criteria discussed above,\nand they refer to concrete entities. But, it is hard to see what\nimport they would have for supporting a metaphysics of stuff. These\nwords are devices for speaking about distinct, discrete objects in a\ncollective manner. In certain contexts, we seek to draw attention to a\nbunch of distinct individuals, not as such, but, for pragmatic\nreasons, as an undifferentiated mass or plurality of a certain\nkind. Few have been led by thinking about the use of the\nwords furniture or silverware to conclude that there\nis a category of stuff distinct from things. But, as we will discuss,\nour metaphysical insouciance with regards to category (a) could very\nwell undermine the contention that concrete mass nouns do in fact have\nmetaphysical import, since there is little or no grammatical\ndifference between terms in category (a) or (b).  \nConcrete mass nouns refer to the kinds of entities discussed most often\nin the linguistically-informed metaphysics literature. They have also\nbeen called ‘physical stuff-kind terms’ (Zimmerman 1995).  \nAbstract mass nouns, if they do refer, do not, prima facie,\nrefer to physical stuffs or hunks of stuff. (And the possibility of\npropositional or abstract stuff is dubious).  \nAddressing issues surrounding abstract, psychological, and quantitative\nmass nouns and their referents is beyond the scope of this article. Due\nto the almost exclusive emphasis on concrete and quasi-concrete mass\nnouns in the metaphysics literature, this article will follow suit.\nWhile an analysis of concrete and quasi-concrete mass expressions could\npossibly be carried over to\ngenerate a general metaphysical theory of masses, the prospects for\nthis are dim. This is because, even given the grammatical similarities\nbetween all mass expressions, there are far too many differences\nbetween concrete stuff and the entities in categories (c)–(e).\nMoreover, we should also be skeptical of the possibility of a\nmetaphysical analysis of concrete and quasi-concrete mass expressions\nto straightforwardly deliver a linguistic or metaphysical\ninterpretation of mass expressions and their referents in general.  \nIn what follows, both concrete and quasi-concrete mass expressions will\nbe referred to as ‘concrete mass expressions,’ except when the\ndistinction is needed. Also, due to our focus, ‘mass expressions’\nhenceforth refers only to concrete mass expressions, except where\nindicated. There are conflicting intuitions\nabout the relation between objects and their constituting matter (see\nthe entry on\n  “material constitution” \nfor more details on this issue). Many make a strong case for an\nontological distinction between stuff (or matter) and things. Here are\nsome typical reasons to believe in the distinction: But, if stuff and things are\ndistinct, they must be intimately related. It is tempting to\nphilosophers to try to reduce or eliminate one of the categories and\nhold that only one category is fundamental\n(or ‘ontologically basic,’ i.e., it must be mentioned in any true,\ncomprehensive, and non-redundant description of the world). \nReflection can lead us to believe that a familiar object, such as a\ntree, is nothing more than some stuff in a certain arrangement. This\nstuff could have been in a different arrangement, possibly constituting\ntwo smaller trees, or perhaps nothing at all. This raises the\npossibility that stuff is more fundamental than things. \nBut, when we look closely at stuff, or listen to scientists, we see\nthat it is likely particulate, and, if particles are objects, then it\nappears that stuff is actually not fundamental after all—objects\nare. Prima facie these positions\ncannot both be true, and our conflicting intuitions call for an\nexplanation as to the relation between stuff and things. The rest of the entry has the following structure. Our target\nquestion, “what do nominal concrete mass expressions refer\nto?”, can also be understood colloquially as, “what are we\ntalking about when we talk about stuff?” We will first look at\nthe three main answers given in\n section 2. \nThe first answer, by far the most popular (and consequently\nreceiving the most attention), is that stuff-talk is talk about masses\nof particles or molecules. The second is that stuff-talk is talk about\nsets, and, lastly, that it is talk about many things (or\n‘pluralities’). The views\nin section 2, in one way or another,\nhold that stuff is very thing-like or reducible to things. In section 3. we will examine more radical\nviews which say that the moral to draw from reflection upon concrete\nmass expressions, among other things, is that the world consists of\nstuff, not things; or stuff in addition to things, where the\nformer is not thing-like. A natural thought to have about sentences with referring nominal\nconcrete mass expressions (e.g., “Alvin drank the water\nthat Roderick poured” or “The coffee in that cup\nis too hot”) is that the expressions refer to portions of\nmatter, which are themselves made up of smaller bits of\nmatter. It seems obvious that thinking this is what taking\nsuch sentences at face value amounts to. Not obvious, though, is what\nmetaphysical commitments this requires, and what metaphysical problems\nmight come along with this thought.  \nA general consensus has been reached that it is helpful to think\nthrough these issues about matter within the framework of mereology, or\nthe logic of parts and wholes (although there is much disagreement\nabout what the correct mereology is). Mereologies are formal systems, but we will be ignoring\ntechnicalities in this entry as far as possible (for details, see the\nentry on mereology).  Still, some\nterminology is necessary and useful. Let us take the notion\nof part as primitive. A ‘simple’ is a\nnon-composite entity, i.e., something with no parts. (Although, in an\nattenuated sense even a simple object has at least one\npart—itself. The everyday notion of ‘part’ implies\nthat any part is smaller than the whole thing it is part\nof. Philosophers and logicians use the term of art ‘proper\npart’ to mean what the folk mean by ‘part’. We will\nfollow ordinary usage, using ‘part’ to mean ‘proper\npart’). A composite thing has more than one part. The\nverb fuse refers to an asymmetric relation between a whole\nand its parts. If two things fuse they ‘join together’ to\nmake up a whole. For example, if the water in my glass and the water\nin your glass fuse, then there exists a thing, a fusion,\nwhich is made up of the two portions (sometimes it is said that the\ntwo portions ‘have a fusion’). No literal contact or\nfusion (e.g., welding two rods together) is implied by this usage. If\na fleet is a single thing, then it is arguably a fusion of the boats\nmaking it up. The nouns whole and sum are synonymous\nwith fusion and composite. Overlap occurs\nwhen distinct things share one or more parts.  It is also necessary to make the following distinctions, which are\nnot standard. Any referring non-plural kind noun K (e.g.,\n‘gold’, ‘lobster’) will fall into one or more\nof the following categories. In these principles,\n‘K’ is to be replaced by a concrete count or mass\nterm: Electrons are atomic, since they have no parts which are electrons.\nAlso, if ships have no parts which are ships, then ‘ship’\nis an atomic kind term as well (Zimmerman 1995, p. 75; Sider\n2001). Portions of non-atomic gunk or infinitely divisible\nmatter of a kind K are K through-and-through, as\nwould an infinitely descending chain of ‘box-particles’,\neach of which contains a box-particle (Gardner 1983,\np. 26). Fruit cake is arguably a fuzzy atomless substance,\nsince it can have parts (e.g., half a blueberry with some gluten\nattached) that are not determinately fruit cake. Some mass terms,\ne.g., ‘cutlery’ and ‘gold’ are\nheterogeneous. While a fork is some cutlery, a tine is not, and,\npresumably, an electron in a gold atom is not gold. Not all the\ncategories are mutually exclusive.  In the various sum-theoretical analyses of mass expressions\n(Cartwright 1965, 1979b; Burge 1977; Moravcsik 1973), all mass\nexpressions with their non-count features disappear upon analysis and\nare replaced by talk of sums (the metaphysical significance of such\nreplacement is discussed in 3.1).  \nThese accounts can get quite technical, but the basic idea is\nrelatively easy to understand. Concrete mass expressions refer to\nmereological sums. So, a sentence such as “Snow is white”\nis, for example, understood to mean that there is a sum of all the\nsnow (flakes, bits, balls, etc.), and that this sum is part of the\nfusion of all the white things (Quine 1960, chapter 20).  A sentence\nsuch as “The water is in the tub” gets cashed out to mean\nthat there is a fusion of water molecules which is in the tub. While\nthere are many permutations on this strategy, sum theorists will,\nwhenever possible, paraphrase away talk of stuffs and talk instead of\nsums.  \nThere are many possible positions for those who wish to analyze mass\nexpressions in terms of sums. What follows is a short survey of some of\nthe most salient decision points one must confront in constructing a\ndetailed view of this kind, and what problems emerge from deciding one\nway or another. In the literature on material objects, an oft-discussed question\nis: when do two or more things compose a further thing (van Inwagen\n1990)?  Some common answers are—never (Compositional\nNihilism—Unger 1979, Dorr and Rosen 2002);\nalways (Mereological Universalism—Lewis 1986,\npp. 212–213; Rea 1998); only when they form a\nlife (Organicism—van Inwagen 1990; Merricks 2001); whenever\nthe candidate fusion has non-redundant causal powers\n(Merricks 2001); whenever (and only whenever) we intuitively\nthink they do (Intuitivism—Commonsense); or that composition is\na brute fact (Brutalism—Markosian 1998b).  \nPerhaps the most commonly held view is Mereological Universalism, or\n‘Unrestricted Mereology’ (‘UM’ for short). Two\nor more things always have a fusion. For example, the Empire State\nBuilding and the Dalai Lama compose an object. \nThe debates about composition largely focus on the fusion of\nobjects—but what of matter? A strong case can be made for what we\ncould call the Unrestricted Fusion of Matter principle:  There are several ways to argue for this. Here’s one: Summativity is a plausible principle. We believe that we refer when\nwe say things like ‘the water in your glass’. Now, if you keep half of\nthe water in your glass, and pour half in Larry’s, and Larry drives\noff with his glass, does the water still exist? Supposing, for\nsimplicity, that none of the water is destroyed, the answer seems to\nbe clearly ‘yes’.  Now, if this is so, and some water can exist while being spread\nout, why suppose that that very same water came into existence only\nwhen poured into your cup (from, say, two bottles)? It seems like it\ncould come into existence when joined only if it went out of existence\nwhen scattered. But it didn’t go out of existence when\nscattered—so it couldn’t have come into existence when\njoined. So, there always was this water fusion (at least as long as\nall the sub-portions of water existed). We can repeat the same\nargument for the copper in those statues. There will also be the sum\nof the gold in Sweden and the lead in Tanzania, if we can replace\nthe K in Summativity with ‘metal’.  \nAnd it also seems true that matter is a genuine kind term. If\nit wasn’t, it is hard to see how scientists could speak, as they do,\nabout universal properties of matter, or what kinds of matter there\nare, or how philosophers could contrast matter with allegedly\nnon-physical minds, abstract objects, and so forth.  (There is also\nthe ‘argument from vagueness’ from Ted Sider, which was\ninspired by the Lewisian idea that any restriction on composition\nwould entail indeterminacy in what exists, which is impossible. In\naddition, any restriction on composition would be unacceptably\narbitrary and anthropocentric) (Lewis 1986, pp. 212–213;\nSider 2001, chapter 4).  So, it seems that any two portions of matter whatsoever have a\nfusion. Accepting this result leads to acceptance of ‘mere\nsums,’ i.e., It has proven extremely tempting to identify matter with mere sums\nin the mereologist’s sense, for the reasons just outlined. Of course, if sums are object-like, and one has reason to believe\nthat the only objects are structured ones, then one would have reason\nto reject Summativity and UFM which lead to the posit of unstructured\nmere sums. Arguments against these principles can be found in\nsections 2.4 and\n 3.2\n(see also Laycock 1972, pp. 4–5; 2006, Appendix III).  Another crucial decision point in developing a sum theory of the\nreferents of mass expressions is deciding whether the elements in the\nsum (e.g., the H2O molecules in some water, the gold atoms\nin some gold) are essential to the sum. The case of the most general\nkind, masses of matter, is a particularly important instance\nof this question. It seems intuitively obvious that when one takes a sip of water, or\nadds a bit of water to a glass of water, that one does not have in the\nglass precisely the same water both before and after. Even if the\nsame amount of water from a different batch replaces the\nwater which was taken away, we still would not have the same water\nafter the replacement. And, if we perform electrolysis on a batch of\nwater but preserve any matter from being lost we can rightly say we\nhave all the same matter as we did before, just not the same water\n(since there is no water). We can construct similar examples for any\ntype of matter. What can explain and unify these obvious intuitions is\nthat there is a most general category of entity—masses of\nmatter, where all the fundamental parts of any\nmass are essential to it. Such masses of matter cannot change parts\nwhatsoever. The existence of entities like this could easily explain\nwhy there is not precisely the same water through these changes. An\nunqualified view of this kind would be that nothing whatsoever can change\nparts—this is called ‘Mereological Essentialism.’ More restricted\nviews hold that at the very least masses of matter cannot change parts.\nMereological essentialism has been an extremely popular approach throughout history.\n(Abelard, Reid, Bishop Butler, Locke, Hume, and Leibniz were all\nmereological essentialists of some kind.) There is much to say in favor of the following principle of\nMereological Essentialism for Masses of Matter in general (for early discussion of\nMereological Essentialism, see Chisholm 1973, 1975; Plantinga 1975): We can argue for a principle like this by first stating that masses\nof\nmatter at a time are individuated by having the same parts, and then\narguing that no mass can change parts over time. \nOur more restricted ‘Mereological Essentialism for Masses’\n(MEM) seems prima facie consistent with allowing ordinary\nobjects to change parts. MEM seems less controversial than\n‘Mereological Essentialism for Objects’ (MEO). MEM seems\nlike something of a truism, and perhaps part of the nature of the\ncategory of matter. But let us turn to an argument for MEM.  At a time, it is easy to distinguish and identify\nmasses. It is trivial that if x is identical to y at\na time, then x and y would have all the same parts,\nwhether or not x and y are sums. This follows\nstraightforwardly from Leibniz’s Law. Since no sum of matter can have\ndifferent parts from itself at a time, then x and y\ncan only be identical sums if they have all the same parts.  One can make a further case that sums’ parts are essential to\nthem over time. Suppose that simples 1–9 exist at\nt1. Assuming UFM, then 1–9 fuse to give us\nthe sum S.  At t1, also by UFM, there is\nthe fusion of 1–8, which we can\ncall S−.  S− ≠ S,\nsince they have different parts (by Leibniz’s Law). If a sum could\nlose a part and persist, then it could be possible for the\nfusion S to come to be made up of different parts. Suppose\nthat only part 9 is destroyed. If MEM is false, then S could\ncome to be composed of exactly what S− is. So, if MEM\nis false, either (i) S became S−,\n(ii) S− went out of existence, or (iii) S\nand S− coincide as distinct sums.  But, (i) cannot be\ntrue: two things cannot become one (although this has been challenged,\nsee Gallois 1998); (ii) cannot be true—how can a mere mass of\nmatter go out of existence without undergoing any intrinsic change?\n(for challenges to this see Markosian 1998a and 2004); (iii) violates\na very clear intuition—if you have some stuff, and take some of\nit away, then you do not have the very same stuff.  So (iii) is\nfalse. But then all of (i)–(iii) are false. And so MEM is\ntrue. (For another challenge to an argument like the foregoing, see\nvan Inwagen 2009.) So, if there can be mere\nsums, and UFM is true, then we ought to believe in\nmereological essentialism for masses of matter, even if we do not\naccept MEO.\n (Arguments against MEM can be found in the supplement\nChallenges to Mereological Essentialism for Masses\nand arguments against UFM in section 3.2.) Of course, if ordinary objects can change parts, but sums can not,\nthen it seems that ordinary objects are not mereological sums. But\nthen, what are they, and how do they relate to the sums which obviously\nseem to constitute them?  \nIf one is serious about the existence of sums of matter, it seems\nthere are only a few ways they could relate to ordinary objects.\n  (The story is more complicated than this. See the entry\non material\nconstitution for more details. We are focusing on issues in\nmaterial constitution especially salient for those who take stuff\nseriously and hold identity to be absolute.)\nOne way is to say that sums constitute ordinary objects\nby coinciding with them. That is, sums are distinct objects\nwhich share all of their parts with the commonsense objects they make\nup. One could also eliminate ordinary objects. Ordinary\nobjects either do not exist, or exist in some kind of shadowy or\nderivative sense (think of ‘the average man’). Another way\nis to say that while sums are in fact things or objects, ordinary\nobjects are a different kind of entity. These dual-category\nviews hold that commonsense objects are in a different ontological\ncategory than sums. \nThose who wish to explore in more detail the metaphysics of masses,\nobjects, and their relations, can read the supplement on\n Sums and Ordinary Objects. Godehard Link and Harry Bunt have argued that the best models of natural\nlanguage use of mass expressions will distinguish mass entities from\ncount by treating the former as if they are non-atomic, whether or not\nthey actually are. Godehard Link (1998) argues that the reference of\nmass expressions is best understood via the development of a rich\nmodel-theoretic semantics, which algebraically models the interrelated\nnetwork of talk of mass, plural, and particular entities. Harry Bunt\n(1985) subsumes both set theory and mereology into an axiomatic system\ncalled “Ensemble Theory” in order to model the structure\nof talk about mass expressions. Link’s account in particular embraces\ncoincidence on a massive scale.  \nSince Link and Bunt’s views are put forward in a relatively\nmetaphysically neutral way, we will relegate more information about\nthese views to an appendix. But, if the modeling they propose handles\nthe linguistic data better than other views then that will give further\nsupport to a theory which embraces both coincidence and infinite\ndivisibility. Hence these treatments are ontologically relevant.\nExamining Link’s theory in some detail can show us just how far\ndistinguishing mass- and count- via the atomic/non-atomic distinction\ncan take us, and what it can’t do for us. See the supplement\n Non-Atomicity and the Mass/Count Distinction A slightly less popular way to answer our question is to treat mass\nexpressions as referring to sets. For instance, suppose there’s some\nwine on the floor. Roughly, according to the masses-as-sets theorist,\nthis is equivalent to there being a set of wine bits (whatever they\nare) on the floor. If Nancy’s ring is gold, then there is a set\nof gold molecules which compose or constitute the ring. If ‘the\ngold’ is identified with a set, then some problems faced by the\nmereologists are avoided. While a mereologist who is committed to the\nexistence of the mass of gold is under pressure to deny the existence\nof the ring if she wants to avoid coincidence, the masses-as-sets\ntheorist has a great advantage in that she can say that both the ring\nand gold exist but are not coinciding material things, since the gold,\nunlike the ring, is a set and not an object.  \nThe masses-as-sets theorist reduces mass expressions to count\nexpressions, by treating concrete mass expressions (e.g., ‘the gold’) as\nveiled count-expressions (e.g., ‘the set of gold atoms’).  \nOne stark problem for the masses-as-sets view (henceforth we will\nidentify a proponent of this view as a ‘set theorist’), is\nthat it identifies paradigmatically concrete stuffs with what are\nusually regarded as paradigmatically abstract objects—sets. How\ncould some gold be a set? Suppose we can pick out a definite portion\nof gold which makes up a ring. If sets are abstract, then the set\ntheorist must say that the gold is abstract. This is pretty hard to\nswallow. Abstract things are not in time or space, but gold is. Also,\nsets are not identical to their members. But the gold in the\nring does seem identical to the members of the set of gold\natoms, not the set itself (for issues regarding ‘many-one\nidentity’, see Baxter 1988 and Wallace forthcoming).  Perhaps the set theorist can instead maintain that masses are sets,\nbut deny that sets (or at least sets of bits of matter) are abstract.\nPerhaps sets of physical objects (such as gold atoms) can be said to be\nin space in virtue of their members being in space. The gold, construed\nas a set of gold atoms, can be said to weigh ten ounces in virtue of\nits members collectively weighing ten ounces. Massy sets have their\nphysical properties ‘by proxy’. So, some gold (a set) has a\nspatial location in virtue of where its members are, has a weight in\nvirtue of its members’ weight, and so on (Zimmerman 1995,\nsections 3 and 9). \nBut, when we try to unpack exactly in which sense the set of gold\natoms is non-abstract, we can see that it is hard to distinguish the\nmasses-as-sets view from the plurals approach which we will examine\nbelow. The non-abstract set theorist will hold that a set of gold\natoms can in fact have physical properties, in virtue of the\nproperties of its members. So, a non-abstract set theorist would first\nparaphrase “the gold weighs ten ounces” into “that\nset of gold atoms weighs ten ounces.” But, in order to explain\nhow a set weighs ten ounces, they would have to again paraphrase and\nanalyze the latter as something like “the set’s members\ncollectively weigh ten ounces.” But if the set theorist has to\nparaphrase their paraphrase, then there is considerable pressure for\nthe set theorist to instead switch over to the stuff-as-plurals view\n(section 2.4) and\njust talk directly about the members. If we are just talking about the\nmembers, or the gold atoms, and we can say what we want about many\nthings without talking about the set of those many things, then why\ncomplicate matters by introducing sets?  There are some problems for the set-theoretic paraphrase. Suppose\none truly says “the melted sugar here is the same sugar that was\nin the packet.” If ‘sugar’ in this context referred\nto the various lumps and grains of sugar in a packet, then, if there\nare no more lumps or grains after the melting, then the set-equality,\nand hence the identity-claim, comes out false. As Pelletier points\nout, when we identify some stuff, there are many different\nindividuating standards available (e.g., ‘packets of__’,\n‘bottles of ____’, ‘granules of___’), and\ndifferent divisions will yield different sets (1974,\np. 94). This ends up either under-determining which identities\nhold, or, absurdly, entailing that some stuff is distinct from\nitself.  In addition, as Zimmerman points out, the set theorist assumes that\nmatter is atomic (1995, section 9), yet it seems possible that there\nis gunky non-atomic stuff (Zimmerman 1996b; Sider 1993). If there are,\nor could be, stuffs like this, then standard set-theoretic treatments\nwill not work, since such theories require all sets to be\nwell-founded. Another problem is that for some stuffs it is (or seems\nto be) indeterminate what, if anything, will count as a smallest unit\nof it—e.g., minestrone soup or beer. So, the set theorist has a\nproblem with non-atomic or fuzzy atomless stuffs\n(see 2.1 for terminology). In what immediately\nfollows, we will only discuss the issue of non-atomicity. Suppose there is a cube of completely homogenous and gunky jello on\nthe table, with no empty space inside. Suppose that the cube can’t\nsurvive being sliced or having its parts scattered. Suppose that the\njello composing the cube is a fundamental stuff-kind. On the\nset-theoretic proposal, to say that the jello constitutes the cube is\nto say that a set of jello-individuals constitutes the cube. Which\nindividuals? One non-option is the set {cube}, for then the jello would\nbe identical with the cube, and could not undergo any changes which the\ncube could not. So, the set must include at least two jello\nindividuals. Suppose that the set’s members are the left and\nright halves of the jello—call them ‘Lefty’ and\n‘Righty’. So, saying that the jello constitutes the cube is\nto say that {Lefty, Righty} constitute the cube. But, of course, there\nis also the set of Lefty’s left half, right half, and Righty’s left and\nright halves. This set, {Lefty’s left half, Lefty’s right half,\nRighty’s left half, Righty’s right half}, is a\nbetter candidate to identify with the jello stuff, since it will\nsurvive if cut into four pieces the right way, whereas {Lefty, Righty}\nwill not. We want to pick out the set of jello-individuals which can\nsurvive any kind of scattering. But, the problem, of course, is that\nLefty’s left half is composed of Lefty’s left half’s\nleft half, and so on. Since the postulation of gunk rules out employing\na set of point-particles, there appears to be no set of\njello-individuals that we can identify the jello stuff with which can\nserve to pick out all the jello stuff and\naccount for the persistence conditions of the stuff (=set) in the right\nway. So, there is absolutely nothing\nwhich is the set of\nindividuals which make up the cube. If we wish to identify the jello\nstuff with every set that is some of it, since the members of every set\nare themselves composed of further sets, then it is sets ‘all the way\ndown’, where we never arrive at members which are not composed of\nfurther members of sets of stuff. Dean Zimmerman notes, For masses of stuff composed of simples, however, the procedure is\nrelatively simple—“whenever you have a larger mass compounded\nout of smaller masses of the same kind, identify the larger mass with\na set of these smaller masses.” There is no way to do this with\ngunky masses, since, for any arbitrarily chosen constituting\nindividual, it itself is a constituted object that needs to have the\nsame treatment applied to it.  \nThe set-theoretical interpretation has many difficulties, and few\nchampions. But, this should not be regarded as the last word on the\nsubject. There are non-well-founded set theories, which could perhaps\nget around the foregoing difficulties.  We do not only speak of individual things, we speak of many things.\nSentences such as “The cheerleaders formed a human\npyramid,” or “Those dogs are sick” are examples of\nplural predication, quantification, and reference. Some hold that some\nplural referring expressions are irreducible to singular predication,\nquantification, and reference (Boolos 1984; McKay 2005; Yi\n2005). According to standard logic, “some things\nare F” is true only if each of those things\nis F. But, as McKay and others point out, “The students\nsurrounded the building” could be true even though it is false\nto say of Bob (one of the students) that he surrounded the building\n(McKay 2005, chapter 1). Those in favor of plural logic argue that we\nneed not countenance sums or sets to account for plural logic, rather,\nwe can take such sentences at face value. Those tigers may be distinct\nfrom those lions, but this doesn’t require ‘the tigers’ to\nrefer to a collection, sum, or particular thing of any stripe.  Some ‘pluralists’, as we may call those who analyze\nmass expressions in terms of plural expressions, hold that mass terms\nare used, generally, to refer to many things at once (Nicolas 2002).\n‘Gold’, on most occasions of use, does not refer to a\nthing—it refers to many things. \nAccording to an early account (Laycock 1975) statements such as\n“the water is boiling” or “Bob took out that\ntrash” mean “those water molecules are\nboiling” and “Bob took out those pieces of\ntrash.” The idea (also developed more fully later by Nicolas\n2008, who, in turn, was inspired by Gillon 1992) that mass expressions\nare used to refer to several things at once seems especially promising\nfor concrete quasi-mass nouns such as silverware\nand furniture, whose reference is particular pieces of\nsilverware or furniture. Concrete mass nouns such as beer\nwill be paraphrased as referring, depending on context, to bottles,\ndrops, glasses, gallons, or quantities (in Cartwright’s 1979b sense) of\nbeer.  \nPluralists about mass expressions differ most markedly from sum and\nset theorists as follows. The set theorist would take ‘the water\nin Merrihew’s cup’ to refer to the set of water molecules in his\ncup, and the sum theorist would take it to refer to a fusion. These\nare both particular entities. But, for the Pluralist, the water is not\na particular thing—it is many things. For example, the account\nthat Nicolas recommends associates to a mass noun [M], not a set of things, but\nsome things, each of which is M…the denotation of the\nexpression the gold on the table, the as, comprises\nany things that are gold on the table. (2008, 22) Many claim that plural logic, reference, predication, and\nquantification is ontologically innocent. That is, we are not\ncommitting ourselves the existence of new entities by employing\nplurals, even if we believe that some usage featuring plural reference\nis irreducible. Being committed to the existence of ‘those\ncats’ (while adverting to Mr. Furrikens, Chairman Meow, and\nMagnificat) is not an additional commitment over and above the\ncommitment to Mr. Furrikens, Chairman Meow, and Magnificat. When one\npays for this apple, and that apple, one gets ‘the apples’\nfor free. (In this respect the ontologically innocent Pluralist has a\nleg up over the set and sums theorists, since the former posits no\nnovel entities.)  In some of his early work Laycock makes arguments by analogy to support\nthe proposal that mass expressions are veiled plural expressions, so\nthat water, in its analysis,\ngets treated like apples or Hobbits does. We turn to the\nanalogies.  \nBoth mass and plural terms refer cumulatively. Just as any two\nportions of water considered together are water, so these apples and\nthose apples together are apples.  Also, Hobbits, just like water, resists\npluralization. For the former, this is because Hobbits is already\nplural: ‘Hobbitses’ does not make sense. Water\ncannot be pluralized and retain its standard reference, since\n‘waters’ either means kinds of water, or\ndifferent bodies of water (e.g., lakes, rivers, pools, seas,\nrather than numerous water per se, which doesn’t make sense\nunless used in a technical or stipulative way). One way to explain\nthis is to suppose that water is already plural.  \nBoth Hobbits and water do not take the indefinite\narticle. Neither ‘a water’ (when not understood in the\nkind sense or with an implicit partitioning e.g., ‘bottle\nof’) nor ‘a Hobbits’ are grammatical. Both mass and\nplural expressions take the definite article since ‘the’\n“does not discriminate between singular and plural”\n(Laycock 2006, p. 35). Both Hobbits and water\ntake the non-singular analogue of the indefinite\narticle—‘some’. Some Hobbits and some water can both\nsurround a castle, and neither use implies singularity.  Both mass and plural terms can be prefaced by partitioning and\nmeasurement terms. One could buy seven pounds of applesauce, or seven\npounds of apples. One could sell a jar of applesauce, or a box of\napples, a gallon of marbles, or a gallon of milk.  \nBut, even given the aforementioned similarities, there are significant\ndifferences between mass and plural terms. While one can infer from\n“There are peppercorns in the sauce” that there is at\nleast one peppercorn in the sauce, one cannot infer from “There\nis wine in the sauce” that there is at least one (non-kind\nusage) wine in the sauce. Furthermore, every plural term (except for\nplural invariable terms such as ‘cattle’ and\n‘groceries’) e.g., ‘cats’, is correlated with\na singular cognate, e.g., ‘cat’. But there are no singular\ncognates for mass terms e.g., ‘water’ or\n‘silverware’  \nThere is much to say for the pluralist position. Plural logic is\nbecoming better understood, less controversial, and a case can be made\nthat standard first-order logic will be subsumed under, or merged with,\nplural logic (for discussion of these issues, see the entry on\n  plural quantification). \n If this is so, and mass expressions are plural\nexpressions, then mass expressions can be accounted for in a relatively\nwell understood and uncontroversial logic which accounts for a wider\nrange of commonsense inferences than standard logic does.  The pluralist account is quite plausible when we consider atomic\nmass expressions, or mass expressions with atomic denotata (def.\n‘atomic’ in 2.1) such as\n‘silverware’, ‘furniture’, and\n‘water’. It will become easy to cash out the truth\nconditions of such talk in terms of the atomic units, such as pieces\nof silverware, furniture, and H2O molecules (Nicolas\n2008). Also in favor of the account is that it does at least as good a job\nas the set-theoretical view since it explains the relationship between\na thing and its constituting matter in a similar way, yet posits no\nnovel entities like sets. There are just the many bits, and the\nconstituted object of which they are parts. This point has been stated\nforcefully by Laycock (1972) and Burke (1997), yet these accounts have\nthe worrying feature of not being truly reductive. See\nsection 3.2 for an ‘ontologically serious’ view of\npluralities. \nMany of the problems which beset the set theorist confront the\nPluralists as well.  What about fuzzy atomless or gunky stuff?  If\ntalk of stuff is to be paraphrased in terms of plural reference, what\nare the individuals slotted for this role? With atomic stuffs, it is\nclear. But with ‘fruitcake’ and ‘taco sauce’\nit is not. Why suppose there is a fact of the matter as to what counts\nas stuffs of these kinds? And if there is no fact of the matter then\nwhat are the individuals we are speaking of when we speak of\nfruitcake? And our Pluralist has just as much trouble chopping up the\nJello cube as the Set Theorist (see\nsection 2.3). \nOf course, vagueness and indeterminacy are problems for most\ntheories of masses, so it could be unfair to overstress this point, and\nit is not at all clear that the pluralist can’t augment her account\nwith standard logics of vagueness or employ analogues to set-theoretic\nnon-well-foundedness moves. Given the many salutary components of\nplural logic in relation to mass expressions, this remains a promising\narea of inquiry.   \n The first three approaches to the referents of concrete mass\nexpressions are all relatively conservative. All three are compatible\nwith what one might call ‘Thing Theory’. In this section we will\nexamine views which posit non-thing-like stuff in addition to things,\nor eliminate things altogether. The relatively orthodox view vis-a-vis things and stuff in\ncontemporary analytic metaphysics is what we could call\n’Thing Theory.’ Thing Theory,\nvery roughly, is the view that (excluding properties and relations)\nall concrete existents, are either things fundamentally, or reducible\nto fundamental things. \nWhat things, individuals, or objects are is itself a controversial and\nmurky matter, and goes beyond the purview of this article (for more,\nsee these related entries:\n object,\n sortals,\n substance).\nRelated terms in philosophy for ‘thing’\nare substance, primary substance, particular,\nexistent, being, entity, and so on. For the\npurposes of this entry, we will take a rather minimalistic view of\nthinghood. We will regard a thing or object as whatever satisfies this\ndefinition: \nAnd now, using the notion of Thinghood, a minimalist Thing Theory can\nbe captured as follows: Thing theorists hold that whatever exists is unqualifiedly\ncountable as one, or reducible to such things. For the Thing Theorist\n“to be is to be countable.” Some Stuff Ontologists would\ncounter—“to be is to be either countable or measurable”\n(a gloss on Burge 1975, p. 459). All three views in section 2 can\nmaintain that, fundamentally, everything boils down to things.  Sums,\nit is usually held, are always sums of things, and these sums are\nthemselves things, and can even be counted. (If there are n\nsimple things, then there are\n2n − 1 sums). Masses-as-sets can\nalways be held to be sets of things, and plural reference can always\nbe held to be reference to a number of things.  \nWe can view ‘Stuff Ontologies’ as views which, in some sense, depart\nfrom this picture and ‘take stuff seriously’. That is, a Stuff Ontology\nis any view which departs from Thing Theory in important respects so as\nto allow non-thing-like stuff to be part of the fundamental furniture of the world.\nThing Theorists believe that\nstuff-talk modeled on mass term use has no\nproper place in the fundamental correct description of the world.  Stuff Ontologists can either (i) eliminate things,\nor, (ii)\naccept that there are things, but hold that they are merely derivative\nentities which are parasitic on the\nfundamental stuff of the world. Thing Theory can be enriched with various\nsupplemental hypotheses to generate a more informative theory. Sum\ntheorists believe in the existence of mere sums (defined\nin 2.2.1) and hold that\nsums are things. If sets of physical things are physical (at least in\na derivative sense by having their physical properties by proxy), then\nthe masses-as-sets theorist can count as a Thing Theorist as well. The\nPlural Theorist of the ontologically innocent stripe, who need admit\nneither sums nor sets (at least for the purposes of mass reference),\ndoes not have any entities which are not things or reducible to\nthings. We will now examine two views, one which\nstates that there are entities which are not things\n(3.2), and another which states that there are no\nthings in addition to stuff (3.3). Some have taken a view of pluralities which is not\nontologically innocent. Henry Laycock and Michael Burke, at times,\nhave tentatively favored the notion that there is a novel ontic\ncategory of plural entities which are not individual items of\nquantification.  \nWhat is the difference between the ontologically innocent and\nontologically serious pluralists, and what is the case for the serious\nposition? The serious pluralist can have several motivations. Laycock\n(1972) argues that there is definite reference of mass expressions,\nsuch as ‘that water’, ‘the water in the tub’,\nbut that this reference is not singular reference. ‘This\nwater’, on a demonstrative occasion, refers, but, “my\ncontention is that this water, unlike this or that drop, is\nnot a particular object” (1972, p. 4).  Laycock claims\nthat “we can and do think of stuff as having\nan independent reality [from things]” (1972,\np. 27, italics his).  While saying “that there is gold in\na certain region is certainly to assert the existence\nof something” (1972, p. 28), he does deny that\nthis ‘something’ is particular, and, throughout his work,\ndenies that it is a set or a fusion. What definite singular terms like\n‘the gold in the…’ “designate is a quite\ndistinct type of item, concrete but not particular” (1972,\np. 28).  If one really believes that i) there is water, ii) we make definite\nreference to it, iii) water is not a thing (i.e., not a sum or set),\nand iv) plural quantification and predication is irreducible to\nsingular quantification and predication, then one might feel compelled\nto accept that mass expressions like water and gold\nrefer to genuine entities distinct from (or ‘over and\nabove’) the water and gold molecules. Let us call whatever it is\nthat is referred to with definite reference by mass expressions in\nthis way ‘pluralities’ (Laycock and Burke do not use the\nphrase, and Laycock would probably find it at best infelicitous, and\nat worst a grave source of metaphysical error). Belief in irreducible pluralities gets more traction when combined\nwith a denial of unrestricted mereology, which is just what Laycock\ndoes:  If one accepts (i)–(iv), and has reason to reject both UFM\n(see 2.2.1) and the set-theoretical view,\nand one wants commonsense sentences featuring mass expressions to come\nout true, then what is left to be referred to by nominal statements\nabout water, lead, etc. except pluralities?  Another motivation can be found in Burke (1997), inspired by\nLaycock. Burke was concerned to resolve the coincidence puzzle between\nnot only a thing and it’s constituting piece of matter, but between\nthese things and the matter per se.  (Since some copper can\npersist past the shattering of a piece of copper which constitutes a\nstatue, then presumably the copper is distinct from either).  Burke’s\naccount, all the details of which do not concern us here (see the\nentry on\n material constitution\nand the supplement \n Sums and Ordinary Objects\n for details) requires\nthat the statue and piece of copper be identical. If this is so, and\nthe statue comes into existence, and is identical with its\nconstituting piece, then a new piece must come into existence and the\nold one cease to be. One of the options Burke canvasses to explain why\nit is that we (mistakenly) assume the piece continues in existence is\nbecause the copper persists through the change: Burke denies the identification of the\nmany copper bits and the piece of copper: It is doubtful, though, that postulating pluralities which are not\nthings can solve the coincidence puzzles. Burke, who himself brought\nup a similar objection to coincidence in general, faces the following\nproblem. How are distinct entities, such as the statue and the copper,\ndifferent in sort, given that they both have the same intrinsic\nproperties? There seems to be a one to one correspondence between the\nfeatures of the statue and those of the copper. Why isn’t the copper a\nstatue, for the same reasons the piece of copper is? Burke can insist\nthat the main difference is that the statue/piece is one thing,\nwhereas the copper is many things, but it is not clear why withholding\nthe honorific thing from ‘the’ copper plurality\nsolves the problem (Zimmerman 1997, p. 23).  It is unclear what the addition of the attribution of\n‘concrete non-particulars’ to the plural analysis is\ndoing, and doubtful that it clarifies matters. Indeed it seems to\nsomewhat back away from the plural analysis. The initial reason for\nanalyzing concrete mass expressions in terms of plural quantification\nand predication is that talk about ‘the lions’ and\n‘those Hobbits’ is relatively unproblematic. But then, why\nreduce mass expressions to plural reference if one holds\nthat water or a water plurality is something over and\nabove those water molecules, yet denies that the lion\nplurality is something over and above those lions? It’s\nnot clear why both water and lions get a plural reference treatment,\nyet the referents of mass expressions get to retain some kind of\nontological halo which distinguishes their referents from non-mass\nplural expressions. Laycock (2006) no longer holds (and only\ntentatively held) that mass expressions are plural. Some stuff ontologists eliminate concrete things altogether. There\nis only stuff, objects being accidental phases of objectively\nnon-objectual stuff. Alternatively, concepts are thought of as\n‘cookie-cutters’, which conventionally carve\npseudo-objects out of the amorphous world-blob, which itself contains\nno objects (cf. Dummet 1981, chap 16; Horgan and Potrč 2000). \nAlan Sidelle, in various places (1989, 1991, 1998) argues that while\nstuff exists, there are no things which exist and actually have the\nessences we believe they do. In 1998 he argues that we should regard\nthe unraveling of a sweater or the chopping down of a tree as not\nsubstantial changes, in which things cease to be, but accidental\nchanges in underlying, persisting stuff:  What is more basic? Stuff. Supposed substantial change\nin objects is actually accidental change to some stuff. Sidelle\ndiagnoses the phenomenon of coincidence as a species of the problem of\nindividuation: He claims that the problem of coincident entities arises not due to\nthe diversity of individuals in a region, but rather due to the fact\nthat the world as it is under-determines which principles of\nindividuation are the correct ones to employ. We can treat any\nproperty as accidental or as essential by employing different sortals,\nor nominal essences, to describe a thing. When a cow dies, we can\ndescribe this either as the accidental change in some flesh-and-bones,\nor the substantial change in a cow which is no more.  Sidelle\nconcludes, in a Lockean vein, that which changes we conceive of as\nsubstantial and which as accidental is more a function of us and our\ninterests than of the way things really are (1998, p. 439). Sidelle goes on to note that our problems with things come about\nfrom supposing that there are any. That is, these problems arise\nbecause of our concept of an object.\n  It is objects which have made the problem,\nand the solution isn’t to switch which objects we allow, but\nto disallow objects altogether. (1998,\np. 441)  Sidelle recommends, tentatively, that we describe the world\nwithout quantification over things, and deny that “there is\ngenuine, world-given individuation.” Furthermore, as it is\nsupposedly obvious that there is at least stuff, we should suppose so,\nand theoretically regard the role of the ‘world-stuff’ as\n“the mind-independent matter of the world which, among other\nthings, determines our perceptions” (1998, p. 443). \nOne problem for this view is that it is virtually indistinguishable\nfrom a Quinean view according to which a physical object is just\n“the content, however heterogeneous, of some portion of\nspace-time, however disconnected and gerrymandered” (Quine 1960,\np. 171). Our sortals, according to a type of Quinean, are used\nto pick out definite filled portions, and any and all of these are\nobjects. What Sidelle calls ‘stuff’ Quine (or Jubien in\n1993) is happy to call an ‘object’. If Sidelle’s stuff\ntalk is inter-translatable into Quinean thing-talk then there is\nmerely a terminological difference between the posit of World-Stuff\nand the posit of arbitrary things. A further strange point about this view is that it entails that,\njust as there are no objects which have the persistence conditions that\nwe think, there are no non-fundamental stuffs. The very same arguments\ngiven for rejecting ordinary objects and reducing them to world stuff\ncan be given for water molecules and sodium chloride. Electrolysis can\nbe seen not as the destruction of water but as a change in persisting\nunderlying stuff. This can be carried on until we get to the\nfundamental stuff(s). Hydrogen can be seen as a phase of a proton and\nan electron, and a proton can be seen as a phase of quarks and gluons.\nSo, it seems that\nelements and complexes, since they are not the fundamental or\nnon-individuated world-stuff, must also be the result of conceptual\ncarvings. \nWhat about fundamental particles (assuming there are some)?\nThey’ve got to go as well, if we assume they are objects. If\nthere are in fact gluons and electrons which exist, are objects, and\nare particular things with identity and persistence conditions, then,\nif they are in fact simple they form the basis out of which we\ncould construct the other objects. So, if non-individual world stuff is\ngoing to play a role, it seems that we must eliminate fundamental\nparticles as well. This approach allows too much physics to be done\nfrom the armchair. It must be noted, though, that such a World-Stuff view is similar\nto some interpretations of elementary particle physics and quantum\ntheory.  Some scientists and philosophers of science do in fact argue\nthat at bottom the world is not a world of things. Rather, the basic\nstuff is non-particular ‘quantum foam’, or\nmass-energy, fields, or structures. Some argue that the only real\nentity is the space-time fabric, ordinary objects just being temporary\nwarpings or disturbances in it. On such views both ordinary\nmacroscopic objects and putative fundamental particles are only\nepiphenomenal entities or temporary manifestations in the\nelectromagnetic or gravitational fields, which are fundamentally\nnon-individual—some kind of world stuff (for details, see the\nentry\n identity and individuality in quantum theory).\n So, one should not rule out\nsuch views tout court. But, given the flux and opacity of\nsuch views, one should not quickly and whole-heartedly embrace the\nnotion of a fundamental non-particular stuff either. These views merit\nfurther examination. Mass expressions and their relations to count expressions, and how\nthey are interpreted and employed by metaphysicians, offer us an\ninteresting and voluminous case-study of recent metaphysics informed\nby lexical and syntactic considerations.  The careful student of this\nmaterial can take away many cautionary tales and useful tools. This is\na very difficult and woolly area of inquiry where there is almost no\nconsensus—not even consensus about the basics. But there is some\ninteresting empirical work on mass and count expressions being done\nwhich is shedding some new light on these issues (see Casati 2005 for\ndetails), and there has been an explosion of recent work in\nlinguistics (see the bibliographies from Link 1998, and the Pelletier\nand Schubert classic paper on the subject linked in\nthe Other Internet Resources). Hopefully,\nphilosophers can work together with linguists, computer scientists,\ncognitive scientists, and others to help achieve some kind of\nbreakthrough.  \nThe category of ‘Stuff’ seems to be where the category\n‘Event’ was thirty or so years ago. It is an important ontological\ncategory which remains poorly understood. In the absence of consensus\non the referents of mass expressions, controversy about stuff is bound\nto continue.","contact.mail":"marksteen@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
