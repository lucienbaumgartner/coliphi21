The central insight of speech thinking is\nthat speech or language is not merely, or even primarily, a\ndescriptive act, but a responsive and creative act which is the basis\nof our social\n existence.[1]\n The greater part of Rosenstock-Huessy’s work was devoted to\ndemonstrating how speech/language, through its unpredictable\nfecundity, expands our powers and, through its inescapably historical\nforming character, also binds them. According to Rosenstock-Huessy,\nspeech makes us collective masters of time and gives us the ability to\novercome historical death by founding new, more expansive and\nfulfilling spaces of social-life.\n\n\nRosenstock-Huessy also belonged to that post-Nietzschean revival of\nreligious thought which included Franz Rosenzweig, Karl Barth, Leo\nWeismantel, Hans and Rudolf Ehrenberg, Viktor von Weizsäcker,\nMartin Buber, Lev Shestov, Hugo Bergmann, Florens Christian Range,\nNikolai Berdyaev, Margaret Susman, Werner Picht (all of whom were\ninvolved in the Patmos publishing house and its offshoot Die\nKreatur) and Paul Tillich. Common to this group was the belief\nthat religious speech, which they saw as distinctly not metaphysical,\ndisclosed layers of experience and creativity (personal and\nsocio-historical) which remain inaccessible to the metaphysics of\nnaturalism.\n\nAs with Franz Rosenzweig (who goes to great length in The Star of\nRedemption and Understanding the Sick and the Healthy to\ndemonstrate that God, man and world underpin three fundamentally\ndifferent and irreducible foundations of explanation which have shaped\nour history), Rosenstock-Huessy was convinced that humanism’s attempt\nto free itself from all gods (making humanity and/or nature the ground\nof reality) was based upon a failure to grasp more ancient insights\ninto the nature of the real and the relationship between reality,\nlanguage and history. To this important extent, again like Rosenzweig,\nhe argued that language was more fundamental than either philosophy or\nreligion and philosophy’s attempt to free itself from and reduce\nreligion to a deficient kind of philosophy was based upon its failure\nto take language, and hence reality, sufficiently seriously. As he\nwould say in a letter to Cynthia Harris: ‘Not religion but\nlanguage forces man to distinguish between this world and the real\nworld, the world as we know it and the genuine, or better known world.\nThe crux of theology is a crux of language, and all our rationalists\nare not protesting against religion but against speech’ (1943,\n162). \nBut unlike Karl Barth or Paul Tillich, for example, who saw themselves\nas fusing philosophy and theology, Rosenstock-Huessy refused to see\nhimself primarily as a philosopher or theologian—though when the\nterm philosopher was qualified by the preceding ‘social’,\nhe was more willing to accept that\n designation.[2]\n His criticisms of theology and philosophy were numerous, varied in\ncontent and highly nuanced—and hence unable to receive full\ntreatment here. Generally, though, he thought both were, what he\ncalled, ‘second order activities’, or products of the\nreflective mind at ‘play’. Philosophical and theological\nspeech trailed behind and were dependent upon the more urgent and\ncreative acts of ‘founding’, that is, those acts which\nemerge out of life’s exigencies, which are epoch making\n‘events’ and which are at the source of human institutions\nand new forms of life, and which cannot be separated from the\nvocabulary, or, more specifically, the shared names and foci of\norientation which connect us across space and over\n time.[3]\n In the most philosophical of all his works, the first volume of his\nSoziologie, when contrasting the respective limits of\ntheology with philosophy, he says that theology is guilty of reducing\nus to sinners and angels and thus not adequately accounting for our\nbeing flesh and blood, while philosophers tend to reduce us to objects\nand things in the dead space of the universe and ‘to mirror the\nobjective world in their subjective world’ (1956, 286).\n‘Religion,’ he says in that same section, ‘is unjust\nagainst nature and the human spirit (Geist)’; while\nphilosophy is blind to ‘the time-endowing forces’\n(‘die zeitstiftenden\n Gewalten’).[4] \nAgainst philosophers and theologians, he saw his task as restoring our\nattunement to the potencies embedded in our speech and institutions so\nthat we could draw upon the power of past times in order to strengthen\nour openness to the promise of the future in the present. To this end,\nwhile his corpus cuts across numerous disciplines, his major\nsystematic work, one rewritten throughout the course of his life, was\nhis two part Sociology  Im Kreuz der Wirchlichkeit (In the\nCross of Reality)—the first volume of which is to appear with\nTransaction in 2017: volume one originally appeared (to use the\nEnglish title) in 1925 as The Forces of Community, and then\nreworked as  The Hegemony of Spaces; volume two being The\nFull Count of the Times. His social philosophy is concerned with\nhow, when a world implodes on or devours them—through what he\nterms the four social diseases of anarchy, decadence, revolution and\nwar (1970a, 11–16)—people can escape the tyranny of forces\nthat have come to rule the space in which they dwell by founding a new\ntime which will then open up other spatial possibilities. For him,\nthen, the key to human freedom is the capacity both to found the new\nand draw upon the powers encapsulated in bodies of time past which\nenable us to live in a present in which we feel blessed by the future.\nRosenstock-Huessy repeatedly argues that philosophy generally is\nparticularly weak in assisting us with this task and it is ultimately\nto sociology that Rosenstock-Huessy turned as ‘the way to win\nagain our freedom over spaces and through times’ (2009,1, 22).\nHence against the Cartesian cogito, which he saw as providing the\nunderpinning formulation of the philosophy of modernity,\nRosenstock-Huessy retorts with the much more archaic Respondeo\netsi mutabor—‘I respond although I will be\nchanged’ (1938, 817–830; 1970b, 17–33). In other\nwords, we are fundamentally responsive creatures—and our\ncreations are shaped by our responses either to the weight and push of\nthe past, the burdens or joys of the present or the pull and call of\nthe future. Like Vico, whom Rosenstock-Huessy greatly admired, he\nbelieves we are inescapably rooted in history, even though our great\nrevolutions attempt to rip us out of it, in order to begin anew and\nbuild a much better world, thereby opening up new paths of\n self-hood.[5] \nPhilosophy’s major deficiency, for Rosenstock-Huessy, is that it is\nnot sufficiently sensitive to time, speech or history. To a large\nextent this is because logic itself is timeless. As he says in\n‘The Terms of the Creed’, ‘logic is that mode of\nspiritual life in which the divinity of timing is omitted’.\nLogic transports us out of time and offers the mind a stable, but\nunreal space. For Rosenstock-Huessy, this search for a stable space is\nreflected in recurrent philosophical elements which privilege the\nimplacability of space (or a particular space) over the ceaselessness\nof time. Modern philosophy’s division of things into subject and\nobject (a spatial configuration) is a case in point, but it goes back\nto the ancients whose building blocks such as topics (from\ntopos place), ‘categories’ (from kata =\n‘down to’ and agora = ‘the public\nassembly’ i.e. declaiming in the assembly), reason’s\nsphericality, and ideas (the very term idea, eidein =\n‘to see’, referring to something visible to the mind’s\neye) all suggest a commitment to (the mental) space’s primacy. The\nsame point is made somewhat more elaborately in the first volume of\nthe In the Cross of Reality (2009, 1,307 –311) where he\nargues that dialectical thought is triadic, but anything that really\nhappens and makes itself manifest, i.e. appears (erscheint),\nis at least\n quadrilateral.[6]\n It must be something in space and time, and hence conform to the\ninner/outerness or subjective/objective matrix of space, as well as\nthe trajective and prejective-ness of time. He called this four-fold\nmatrix the cross of reality and it is applied repeatedly throughout\nhis works. \nWhile Rosenstock-Huessy provided a range of arguments against\nphilosophers wanting to make more of reason and less of language, time\nand history than their due, and while he preferred to classify himself\nas a sociologist, he can also be seen as a social philosopher who\nargued for the philosophical necessity of the fusion of history,\nlinguistics, anthropology, sociology, and religion. Franz Rosenzweig\ncertainly saw Rosenstock-Huessy in this light, and he once said to\nhim: ‘You have never…been to me anything other than a\n“philosopher”’(1969,\n 82).[7]\n In this respect he belongs to that long line of critics of philosophy\nthat range from ancients to moderns and comic poets to religious\nthinkers—from Aristophanes to Lucian, to Rabelais, from Tatian,\nto Tertullian to Luther, and Pascal to Marx and Nietzsche. All these\ncritics have provided criticisms of philosophy that have ended up, in\ndifferent ways, and at different times, transforming the direction and\ncontent of philosophy. \nEugen Rosenstock was born in 1888. His parents were assimilated (i.e.\nnon religious) German Jews. His mother and father, a banker,\nencouraged academic pursuits in their children. At school his classes\nwere in Latin, and from a young age he devoted himself to history and\nlinguistics. His passion for learning languages extended to teaching\nhimself Egyptian hieroglyphics while a teenager. He is probably one of\nthe very few social philosophers who (apart from his fluency in\nseveral modern European languages) not only read the biblical writers,\nancient philosophers, poets, orators and Church fathers in their\noriginal languages, but was equally at home deciphering the walls of\nan Egyptian temple. This schooling formed the basis of an approach to\nreality which always considered the different underlying\nimperatives—divine and human—that fused a group or led to\nits dissolution. It also provided him with what he insisted was a\nguiding methodological principle in his life: to make no historical\nargument that was not based upon his own consultation of the original\nsource material. \nHe joined the Protestant church at 17. By his own account, this was\nnot due to any great existential anxiety, but to having reached the\nconclusion at a very young age that what was stated in the Nicene\nCreed was manifestly obvious (1970b, 197). Rosenstock-Huessy insisted\nthat Christianity was not a religion of transcendence and was not to\nbe confused with Platonism of any sort, but was about building the\nages or times to come in this world. It was first and foremost a\ndiscovery about the process of incarnation and the way to overcome\nsocial death. Nor for him was the Church, as it was, for example, for\nKarl Barth or Emil Brunner, for the great part a massive deviation\nfrom the gospel. Rather, not only in spite of but, to a significant\nextent, because of its flaws, it was the story of the incarnation of\nthe spirit and the recreation of human nature into a different body,\nthe body of Christ. In other words, the task of the Church was that of\nmaking man like God, what the Church fathers in the Athanasian creed\nhad called ‘anthropurgy’ (1946, 108). Such core Christian\nterms as ‘last judgment’ or ‘redemption’,\nthen, had nothing to do with the individual surviving after death in a\nplace called heaven or hell (an idea he thought owed more to Plato\nthan Jesus or Paul). Resurrection meant the resuscitation of\nhistorically spent forms of life so that their powers could be tapped\nfor generations to come; the last judgment refers to the decision\neither to ‘resurrect’ a dead form of life, or let it die.\nThus in his ‘Faculty Address on The Potential Christians of the\nFuture’: \nExamples of incarnations he mentions, beside Christ himself in the\nChurch, are St. Francis in the Franciscan order and all its\nachievements, Leonardo da Vinci by succeeding generations of\nengineers, Sigmund Freud in the psychiatric movement, Marx in the\nworkers’ movement, and so on (1956, 303–309). \nRosenstock-Huessy studied jurisprudence and received his doctorate\n(for Herzogsgewalt und Friedensschutz) from the University of\nHeidelberg at the age of 21, from which time he went on to teach at\nthe university. He was also to receive a second doctorate in 1923 in\nHistory from the same university, for his Königshaus und\nStämme in Deutschland zwischen 911 und 1250, a book he had\npublished in 1914. His teachers included Rudolf Sohm and Otto Gierke,\nboth key figures in the historical school of law. While he was not a\ndisciple of either, throughout his life he would never cease writing\non the growth and decay of socio-political formations and what forced\npeople to hate one form of life and seek to found another. \nAmongst his students was Franz Rosenzweig. In 1913 Rosenstock-Huessy\nplayed a pivotal role in convincing Rosenzweig that the ‘living\nGod’ was not the God of metaphysics who, thankfully, had been\npronounced dead by Nietzsche, but referred to a power more\n‘meaningful’ and ‘truthful’ than could be\naccounted for by the limited powers of philosophy. By this he was not\nreferring to any mystical powers, but the full gamut of creative and\nredemptive powers that are created and revealed throughout the human\nstory. In this respect he played an important role in convincing\nRosenzweig that truth was not so much a property of things or states\nof affairs captured by the reflecting mind, but a state of fecundity\nproduced by the act appropriate for the time in which it was\nperformed. If Rosenstock-Huessy can be said to have an epistemology\nwhich can be reproduced in one sentence, it is Goethe’s ‘What is\nfruitful, that alone is true’, which is but a recasting of the\nbiblical ‘by their fruits you shall know them’ (1968,\n11). \nIn 1914, he met and married Margrit Huessy whom he loved dearly. They\nhad a son, Hans, and they remained married until her death in 1958. He\nwas then joined by Freya von Moltke, who was to be his companion until\nhis death in 1973. Freya von Moltke was the widow of his former\nstudent, Helmuth von Moltke, a key member of the Kreisau circle who\nwas executed by Hitler near the conclusion of World War 2. \nDuring the Great War, Rosenstock-Huessy served as a captain in the\nGerman army where he fought on the Western front. In 1916 he began an\nintense correspondence with Rosenzweig (now published in English as\nJudaism Despite Christianity) who by that time had decided\nnot to follow Rosenstock-Huessy and his cousins, the Ehrenbergs, into\nChristianity, but to fully embrace the Jewish faith into which he had\nbeen born. That correspondence has remained a major post-Nietzschean\nChristian/Jewish dialogue. While in that correspondence\nRosenstock-Huessy was uncompromising in his insistence that Judaism\nwas a spent historical force, he continued to reflect upon\nRosenzweig’s decision to remain a Jew throughout his life. He came to\nthe opinion that Rosenzweig had convincingly demonstrated the eternal\nrole of Judaism in the human story. \nA year after this exchange began Rosenzweig met and fell in love with\nRosenstock-Huessy’s wife, Margrit or Gritli. Rosenstock-Huessy\naccepted, though not without suffering (Stahmer, 2006), the love that\nhad developed between his best friend and his wife, and years later he\nwould confide to his friend and devotee Georg Müller that Margrit\nhad been Rosenzweig’s muse throughout the writing of The Star of\nRedemption, and, more precisely, that Rosenzweig’s understanding\nof revelation, which plays such a decisive role in that same work,\ncame directly out of his experience of his love for Gritli. This has\nbeen borne out in the relatively recent publication of Rosenzweig’s\nletters to Gritli (Briefe an Gritli) which has been the\nbiggest event in Rosenzweig scholarship since Edith Rosenzweig’s\nedition of his Briefe in\n 1935.[8] \nRosenstock-Huessy had entered the Great War as a Christian\nNationalist. By the War’s end he was convinced that Germany’s\nsalvation required the dropping of all nationalist\nallegiances—its failure to do so, he predicted, would only throw\nit back again into further war. He also emerged from the War with an\nidea (first outlined in book-form in Die Hochzeit des Kriegs und\nder Revolution) that he would develop in Out of\nRevolution and Die Europäischen Revolutionen und der\nCharakter der Nationen—that the Great War was the\nculmination of a millennium of revolutions and that it was these very\ncatastrophes which provided the genesis of new and more powerful\ninstitutional bulwarks for what would become the fulfillment of the\nkingdom promised to the Jews and later to the human race through\nChristianity. \nA core element of Rosenstock-Huessy’s social philosophy, which emerged\ndirectly from his experience of the War and his subsequent\n‘vision’ of the meaning of a thousand years of European\nwars and revolutions and political legacies, was that suffering was a\nfundamental component of human learning. For the most part, and\nparticularly socially, truth was something imprinted on us by pain and\ntrauma rather than something merely learnt by candlelight. As he said\nbluntly in one public lecture: ‘suffering is the only source of\nwisdom, and not my brain here ’ (1967, Microfilm 656, Reel 18).\nHe develops this idea in ‘The Secret of the University’ in\na manner which suggests we should be much more attentive to the\ncatastrophic conditions under which any new philosophy emerges if we\nwish to see it in its proper light— philosophy being but one\nresponse to a social catastrophe which requires a great redirection of\nenergies for either society’s survival or its complete overthrow and\nthe establishment of a new type. \nAfter the War Rosenstock-Huessy worked in Daimler Benz as an editor of\na worker’s magazine before he returned to the academic life. The\ndesire to bridge the divide between education and the world remained a\nconstant thread of Rosenstock-Huessy’s life, including his being a\nfounding member of institutions such as the Academy of Labor in\nFrankfurt (1921) and the German Academy for Volk Research and Adult\nEducation (1926) and being vice chairman of the World Association of\nAdult Education (1928–1932). He was also a pioneer of the German\nwork service movement in Germany, which was designed to engage\nstudents with the rest of the community (a movement which was later to\nbe politicized and corrupted by the Nazis), and, after emigrating to\nthe United States, the establishment of Camp William James in Vermont\n(which was undertaken as part of Franklin Roosevelt’s Civilian\nConservation Corps). The importance of the fusion of education with\nwork, for Rosenstock-Huessy, was based on his fundamental belief that\nhumanity would only free itself from the perils of its past through\ncreative collective acts, including reinvigorating the institutions\nwhich had themselves emerged as responses to, and ways out of,\ncatastrophes, as well as the establishment of new institutions\nappropriate for the times. \nWith Hitler’s coming to power in 1933, Rosenstock-Huessy, his wife and\nson left Germany. The émigré political scientist Carl\nFriedrich helped him get work at Harvard, but it was not a satisfying\nexperience for him or many of his colleagues. He was forced to leave\nHarvard because he insisted that ‘God’ was a living\npresence in history. Within ‘speech thinking’, a core\naxiom is that a name which generates reality (as ‘God’\ndoes through invocation, supplication, devotion and the like) is real\n(more real, he insisted, than abstractions such as mind or body). At\nHarvard there was the collision of two paradigms and their respective\nvocabularies: Rosenstock-Huessy’s ‘speech or\ndialogical-thinking’ with its anti-naturalism (ironically, in\nthat environment, a voice of one) versus the naturalistically based\nbehaviorism that then predominated. A good example of the differing\nperspectives can be seen in Crane Brinton’s scathing comments on\nOut of Revolution (1938) and Rosenstock-Huessy’s withering\nretort in his review of Brinton’s The Anatomy of Revolution\n(1939). \nRosenstock-Huessy then started teaching social philosophy at Dartmouth\nwhere he remained for the rest of his academic career. While the stars\nof former friends and associates, such as Buber and Tillich, waxed in\nthe United States, he was largely unknown and unlistened to, except\nfor some devoted undergraduates who taped his undergraduate lectures\nfor posterity. He had not been completely forgotten in Germany, where\nhis post-war lectures were well attended and his books reviewed in\nnewspapers. While his name still crops up from time to time in\nEuropean historical or sociological works (his Die Europaischen\nRevolutionen is something of a German minor classic in European\nStudies), Rosenstock-Huessy’s ideas have not received a large\naudience. In part, at least, this has to do with his failure to\nconform to conventional academic categories of classification and\nscholarly protocols and disciplinary requirements, in particular the\ntheological/secular divide. In addition, there was almost no\nprevailing mood into which Rosenstock-Huessy’s thought seemed to tap:\nneither the aesthetic/literary mood of modernism (in general\nRosenstock-Huessy thought art was play—and the period which\nspanned two world wars was not a time in which play would help stave\noff the next catastrophe); nor the subsequent radical student mood\nwhich Marxian-based social theories attended to (Rosenstock-Huessy\nthought neo-Marxists of all kinds to be a hundred years out of date);\nnor the psychoanalytic movement that derived from Freud or Jung (he\ndeeply mistrusted psychiatry, believing it placed too much weight upon\nthe ego and did not adequately grasp the collective socio-historical\nformations which shape it); nor phenomenology (whose dependence upon\nlived experience was closer in spirit to his own thought, but,\nnevertheless, its purview remained insufficiently dialogical and\ninsufficiently institutional for him to see much value in it). He was\nalso unforgiving of Heidegger (as he was of Carl Schmitt whom, before\nHitler’s rise to power, he had once been on cordial terms with) and in\nthe Soziologie, he recounts, with contempt, a story in which\nElfride Heidegger talks of her husband and her having to weigh up\nwhether they would back the Marxists or the Nazis (2009, 2, 57). The\nproliferation of work in linguistics, which might have seemed to have\nprovided him with natural allies, did not help his case because he was\ndeeply opposed to what he thought was the prevailing atomistic and\nunduly scientistic approach to the study of language. Mauthner and\nSaussure, for example, he thought were so wrong they barely warranted\nengaging with. And someone like C.S. Peirce, whose pragmaticism has\ncertain affinities with Rosenstock-Huessy’s understanding of truth,\nalso differs from Rosenstock-Huessy in his preoccupation with\n‘reasonable’ and ‘objective statements’ as the\nroad to truth. He saw himself more in the organicist tradition of\nHumboldt and was glad to find in R.A. Wilson’s The Miraculous\nBirth of Language a contemporary linguist who had reached some\nsimilar conclusions to his concerning language’s role and character in\nour social evolution. \nThis lack of academic ‘fit’ was a fact not lost on him and\nin the final paragraph of his Out of Revolution he wrote,\nwith an eye as much to his Harvard experience as to his awareness of\nhow he was being read: \nBy the time Rosenstock-Huessy died in 1973 he had left behind a huge\ncollection of written work including his two volume\nSoziologie (the second volume of which is an attempt at\nuniversal history), the works on revolution, a collection of essays\nand small books gathered in a two volume work on language, Die\nSprache des Menschengeschlechts, and a three volume work on\nchurch history (with Joseph Wittig), Das Alter der\n Kirche,[9]\n to various writings on grammar, biblical interpretation, Egyptology,\nMedieval history, industrial law and the organization of the work\nplace. \nA few years before he died, a former student, Clinton Gardner, had\nformed Argo Press, to keep his work alive. A Gesellschaft had\nbeen started in Germany which produced a journal/newsletter,\nStimmstein, devoted to his work, influence, and related\nissues. In 1972 four families in Holland set up\n‘Rosenstock-Huessy House’ in Haarlem to put\nRosenstock-Huessy’s ideas concerning adult education and voluntary\nservice into practice through providing accommodation for people in\ncrisis. A DVD edition of his collected works has been created, thanks\nto the labours of Lise van der Molen and the efforts and donations of\nthe Rosenstock-Huessy Fund. W.H. Auden first heard of\nRosenstock-Huessy in 1940 from a friend and wrote a preface to a\ncollection of his writings (published by Argo in 1970 under the\nsalient title I am an Impure Thinker). After\nRosenstock-Huessy’s death, Auden wrote a valedictory poem,\n‘Aubade’, which was published in The Atlantic\nMonthly. \nIn Ja und Nein, a work written a little over four years\nbefore his death, Rosenstock-Huessy thanked Georg Müller for\nhaving summed up seven decades of thought in the three words: speech,\ntime, history. ‘I seem’ he says ‘to have pursued the\ndaily life of peoples and their members as reflections of this\ntrinity. I have looked at the speech of individuals and nations, the\ntimes of lovers and haters, the history of empires, the church and\nsociety as the reflections of the divine trinity’ (1968, 9).\nThese three terms not only sum up the orientation of\nRosenstock-Huessy’s life work, they also provide the key to\nunderstanding where he thinks philosophy has gone wrong. \nFor Rosenstock-Huessy, speech’s significance was not to describe a\nlitany of factual statements about the world of the sort ‘it is\nraining’—see “Es Regnet oder die Sprache steht\nauf dem Kopf” in Die Sprache des\nMenschengeschlects). Nor is it, as Saussure held, simply a means\nof A expressing his or her intention to B. Moreover,\nRosenstock-Huessy’s interest in speech is restricted to what he calls,\nin The Origins of Speech, ‘authentic speech’.\nThis is not the kind of speech which has its parallels in the animal\nkingdom. Authentic speech is the foundation and perpetuation of\nconstitutions and institutions—social acts that reach across\ngenerations and establish patterns of social complexity which show us\nthe difference in our self- and world-making and that of animals. \nThat solidarity is ultimately historical, for it is only by being able\nto draw upon the powers of the past and future that the human being\ncan survive the crises of their present. Thus speech and history form\nan indissoluble connection. As he says, ‘Language is the vehicle\non which history invades the animal life of man. And the study of\nhistory and the study of language are one and the same study’\n(1943, 173). \nSpeech, then, is a responsive and creative act in which we discover\nthings about ourselves, each other, and the world itself which we\nwould never have chanced upon had we not the power to reframe the\nuniverse through speech—speech accounts for our unpredictable\nnature. And a large part of Rosenstock-Huessy’s objection to\nnaturalism is that either it ignores speech completely and reduces us\nto more basic animal or physical processes, or, if it does take\naccount of speech, it places speech on the same continuum as animal\ncries and calls. \nThe social character of speech also means that it is not only a matter\nof what is being said when we speak to one another, but also who is\ntalking to whom—what a parent says to a child, a president to\nhis or her people, what friends say to one another. As he writes in\nJa und Nein: \nThis one example shows how Rosenstock-Huessy differs from Saussurian\nlinguistics which break up the world into the units of language\nirrespective of how language circulates socially. It also shows how\nfar removed Rosenstock-Huessy is from the naturalistic based\nphilosophical models which see the world as an object to be\nunderstood. For Rosenstock-Huessy, the truth of the world we\nparticipate in—which includes the panoply of names and concepts\nand theories which we ascribe to nature—could never have been\n‘noticed’ by a disinterested scientific spectator some\nthree thousand years ago because it wasn’t there yet. It takes time\nfor us and our truths to become created and revealed to us and speech\nis the power of disclosing ourselves to each other, and ourselves, in\npart through our respective roles which enable us to preside over a\nparticular domain of ‘powers’. Speech takes and makes\ntime. In an important sense, for Rosenstock-Huessy, speech is\nrevelation which is, in turn, orientation (which is also a process of\nmutual development): \nIn speech then we really make each other and hence we are literally,\nfor Rosenstock-Huessy, the word made flesh. The corollary of this is\nthat ‘we ourselves become structured by grammar’. He puts\nit more forcefully when he writes ‘most men are shards of broken\ngrammar’ (1968, 37 and 43), and he went so far as to hold that\ngrammar is the key to us as social organisms. In keeping with this, he\nproposed a re-working of the social sciences on the basis of a\ngrammatical revolution. Indeed, he believes that as things are now,\nthe social sciences rest on a grammar that is akin to Ptolemaic\nastronomy. (See ‘Die kopernikanische Wendung der\nGrammatik’ in Die Sprache des\nMenschengeschlechts.) \nVery briefly, he argues that the intellectual life of nations, and the\nprofessions which give us social orientation, are responses to the\nuniverse seeking its own enhancement through the distribution of tasks\nand activities which have a grammatical underpinning. Thus, deploying\nthe quadrilateral matrix necessary for correctly observing any social\nreality, he argues that our experiences will be accumulated and\ndevolved through these spatial/temporal grammatical modules so\nthat: \nAccordingly, the professions (lawyers, preachers, artists and\nscientists) are grammatical necessities, each profession accentuating\nan aspect of reality whose grammatical mode is the trajective,\nprejective, subjective and objective respectively. For\nRosenstock-Huessy, a society’s survival and development depends very\nmuch on its ability to cope adequately with its inner and outer\nspatial and trajective and prejective temporal potencies. We need to\nwork with all these potencies and the great danger of philosophy is\nthat it elevates its own importance—and the procedures and\ngrammatical elements which constitute it—at the expense of other\npotencies which are only disclosed and developed through other\ngrammatical elements and procedures. In this respect,\nRosenstock-Huessy sees that when philosophy tries to dominate society\nit does so at the expense of other powers of society and hence\nultimately is pernicious. Its main deficiency lies in its\nunder-appreciation of the fecundity and importance of the polyform\nnature of speech. \nRosenstock-Huessy complains that linguistics has followed philosophy\nin elevating the mind above speech, as if the mind itself is the real\nthinker and speech simply a rather poor means to get from a\nto b. (‘Fritz Mauthner wrote 6000 pages and proved in\none and a half million words that all words lie’ (1962, Vol. 1,\n554)). Such approaches to speech all follow what he calls ‘the\nabstract madness of the school grammar’, which makes the mistake\nof explaining ‘the last grammatical creation, the declarative\nsentence “these are”, as the beginning of speech.’\nIn fact, he says, a declarative sentence is: \nFor Rosenstock-Huessy, the Alexandrian grammar table, which was\noriginally developed in the 4th century BC as part of\nlarger pedagogical architectonic of the sciences and which is still\nthe standard manner of grammar instruction, has been one of the great\nhidden obstacles to understanding real or speech thinking. His claim\nis that the Alexandrian architectonic carries with it a specific\norientation to ourselves and reality whose core elements mistakenly\nbecome solidified and privileged and passed on as if reality itself\nwere essentially—always and everywhere—composed of its\nelements. In particular it privileges the disinterested, impersonal,\nreflective mode, which breaks up the world into subject and predicate,\nsubject and object. This orientation also brings everything under the\nrule of the indicative mood of the declarative sentence. \nIt is this emphasis upon the declarative sentence, which provides the\nanswer to ‘what is?’, that lies behind the repeated\naccusation he makes against philosophy—that it has\ninstrumentalized speech. As Rosenstock-Huessy says in ‘The Race\nof Thinkers or the Knacker’s Yard of Faith’ (1962, Vol. 2, 612):\n‘The scandalous [and terrific and unheard] claims of the\nthinkers consist in this: that first they think, and only after that\ndo they mis-advisedly or treacherously disclose what they think to us\nwith the help of speech as their\n tool.’[10] \nOf course, philosophy from its inception appealed to the possibility\nof judging the world. Thus the importance to it of the subjunctive or\noptative mood. As he wrote in his early work  An Applied Science\n(or Know How) of the Soul: \nAlso: \nKant’s distinction between theoretical and practical reason\nexemplifies how this move from indicative to subjunctive is\nattempted—as the categorical imperative first requires\nacknowledging that the will (the base of the subjunctive) is only free\nwhen it is not in violation of the laws potentially knowable by\ntheoretical reason (the indicative). Thus, when Kant says that he\nwishes to create a rational faith by defining the limits of\nexperience, just as when he says that ‘ought’ implies\n‘can’, he is really showing, from Rosenstock-Huessy’s\nperspective, that the entire metaphysical edifice is derived from a\nlexical ordering of grammar. \nThe architecture of the Alexandrian grammar was itself a result of the\ncentral role that it had ascribed to philosophy in the sciences so its\nconcurrence with philosophy in grammatical priorities should come as\nno surprise. To a large extent it does this because it has already\nmade some fundamental linguistic commitments which Rosenstock-Huessy\nthinks have plagued philosophy from its very inception and whose span\ncan be witnessed from Parmenides to Heidegger, and which he also sees\nas repeatedly dragging philosophy and its followers into phantasmic\npursuits. In the first instance, and what he holds responsible for\nphilosophy’s break from what he calls its ‘aboriginal\nhumanity’, is its grammatical preference for pronominals rather\nthan names (1970b, 77–90). \nRosenstock-Huessy argues that it is not only from the moment of birth\nthat one is inducted via names—the names of one’s parents, their\nfamily, one’s birthplace, one’s own name— but our life is a\ncontinuous accrual of names as each person is shaped by his or her\nexperiences, thus developing new qualities or characteristics. Through\nthe course of a life each of us is enmeshed in an expanding cluster of\ntitles that reflect one’s responses to the callings and imperatives of\none’s parents, friends, teachers, spouse and children, colleagues,\ngovernment, society and, far from being least, one’s enemies. Naming\nis orientating. As he says in Ja und Nein: \nNames, then, refer to dynamic processes that move over time. On the\nother hand pronominals transport us beyond those processes to\nsomething more stable; they take us out of the specific relationship\nand have us think about relationships in a more general manner. As\nwith Schelling’s distinction between positive and negative philosophy\nand the limits of the later, Rosenstock-Huessy is highly suspicious of\nabstractions and he believes that philosophers have tended to put too\nmuch faith in them, believing that they provide the magic key for\nbringing order into the disorder of the world. The accusation by\nSocrates that his interlocutors do not have a specific virtue unless\nthey can provide a logically tight definition for ‘what (the\nspecific) virtue is’, and the Parmenidian formulation that\n‘being is’ are, for Rosenstock-Huessy, but variants of\nthis mistaken grammatical faith. \nFor Rosenstock-Huessy, the problem with the kind of case Plato makes\nin favor of essences and against names in the Cratylus (where\nhe provides a satire on the sophists’ use of etymology) is that the\nessence is purchased at the expense of the many processes which names\nrightly recognize as many. Of course Plato insists that the one and\nthe many must be brought into the union of knowledge’s correct\ndefinition. But Rosenstock-Huessy argues that names are primarily an\nhistorical founding, and hence not a logical matter. Rosenstock-Huessy\nemphasized this point in his Lectures on Greek Philosophy\nwhen he contrasted Book 2 of the Iliad, where Homer recalls\nthe ships and the names of the places and commanders of the different\narmies of the Greeks, with Plato. ‘Homer’s heart,’ he\nsays, ‘is in following the first impressions also in the\nphysical, in the real life…He’s not systematic. He’s\nanti-philosophical…Because a philosopher must have all his\nmaterial gathered before he can subdivide it…Therefore it’s\nalways a second impression, it’s an afterthought.’ Whereas the\nphilosopher is suspicious of the same name that may be concealing\ndifferent essences, Homer is not interested if two people have the\nsame name in trying to establish a common essence, but in this naming\nof the ships ‘poetry has to keep the individual names of every\none city here’ (1956b, Oct 18). \nUnlike a pronoun, a specific name locates, sums up, emphasizes an\nevent that has been or will become; it is done to orientate (even if,\nas in a lie, to veil). As Rosenstock-Huessy says: \nThe political power of names makes people circulate. Names signify our\ndivision of labor. They make room for a man and a thing. The\n‘throne’, the ‘hustings’, our\n‘tongue’ as Greeks, the ‘eye of justice’, the\n‘thunder of Zeus’, those were all names whose invocation\nmade people move out or in… \nNames make no sense unless they stand in mutual relation. Mother is\nnot mother unless she may call, under the law, somebody the father.\nBrother is brother to a sister. And unless he calls her sister and she\ncalls him brother, the name is worthless. The general and the\nsergeant, the master and the apprentice, the army and the navy make\nroom for each other, in the wonderful whole of names. All names belong\nto this holon, to society. No name is good without the\nothers. The Pan of the universe drives people panicky, that is they\nlose speech. The holon of the city gives everybody a name in\nsuch a manner that everybody else now can be named by him, too (1970b,\n83–84). \nOn the other hand, a pronoun is a way of not being precise about such\nthings as location, emergence, faith, hope, or love: \nPronouns are a compromise between the real name of a person or a thing\nand the pointing finger while such person or thing is within the reach\nof our sense perception. To call a spade a spade is one thing; to\npoint to the spade while it lies before us, which simply requires the\ngesture and a ‘there!’, is a totally different act. One is\nthe act of naming, the other is an attempt to reduce naming to its\ninformal minimum (1970b, 82). \nFor Rosenstock-Huessy the problem of names is also a key component in\nthe dispute between Heraclitus’ flux and Parmenides’ sphere of being.\nLike Nietzsche, he saw that the two philosophies represent the choice\nbetween one path generally not taken by philosophers (Heraclitus’)\nwhich would enable us to enter more deeply into the tensions and\nstruggles of life, and another (the road more traveled of Parmenides)\nwhich stabilizes and logicizes and hence simplifies the abstract\nworld, thus making it of very limited real worth for orientating us in\nlife. In what he calls a ‘conjuration’, a letter he\ncomposes from Heraclitus to Parmenides, he has Heraclitus say to\nParmenides: ‘“Being” is the scalp of the divine acts\nand the political names. This scalp hangs dangling on your belt. To\nhell with your “pronoun”, to hell with your\n“pro-verb” “being”. Or we shall all find\nourselves in hell’ (1970b, 90). \nIn Ja und Nein he makes the point that what is done with\nnouns is also done with verbs, most notably in the case of philosophy\nwith the verb sein (to be)/ noun Das Sein which is\nthen rendered as being, which he sees as simply the dead husk or the\nsmoke of what once had life. \nThe great choice for post-Nietzschean thinking, for Rosenstock-Huessy,\nis not so much, as Heidegger believed, a choice between continuing to\nremain entrapped in our compliance with beings rather than Being, but\nbetween continuing to take our orientation from pronominals rather\nthan giving attention to names. In this respect Heidegger is\nGreek—i.e. still philosophical—whereas Rosenstock-Huessy\nis (to use a much loved word of Heidegger) genuinely\n‘primordial’ or pre-philosophical because he thinks the\npre-philosophical was wiser in its fidelity to language. Moreover,\nfrom Rosenstock-Huessy’s perspective, what Heidegger has in common\nwith the essentialist thinking he is so critical of, is that he still\nfools himself into thinking that he is not part of the great events of\nhistorical experiences which are encapsulated in names. Heidegger\nthinks that with thought he can move beyond them. The thought itself,\nfor Heidegger, when it is not merely pronominal pro-verbial thought,\nis so saturated in history it cannot be overleaped except by a social\nrupture and a new social foundational act and\n name.[12]\n From Rosenstock-Huessy’s perspective, Heidegger’s deployment of\nBeing, as a gesture of defiance against the technicity into which the\nworld has fallen, is precisely the same kind of optatively-governed\ngesture which characterizes the philosopher’s freedom (an aesthetic/\nmoral one). Heidegger’s refers to himself in his Der Spiegel\ninterview of 1966 as awaiting a new god, a god who must remain\nnameless, on an earth from which the gods have fled. From\nRosenstock-Huessy’s perspective, this is indicative of just how barren\nis his landscape of possibilities. For all Heidegger’s talk of being\nbeyond metaphysics, from Rosenstock-Huessy’s perspective, Heidegger is\nso afraid of repeating the gestures and moves of metaphysics that he\nis imprisoned by them. He is still primarily a philosopher, and far\nless a Mensch, as the speech thinkers like Rosenstock-Huessy\nsought to be, exercising ‘common sense’ and\nworking with the common stock of names. \nBy appealing to the primacy of names, Rosenstock-Huessy is not saying\nthat one must always accept one’s tradition; traditions have to\nconstantly be reinvented or reconfigured. However he does dispute that\nthe basis of that transformation is primarily a philosophical act, as\nif the disinterested philosopher could digest and judge everything\nwith his or her own mind. Names are constantly being renegotiated and\n‘to think means to introduce better names’ (1970a, 174).\nBut for the most part this process occurs through the trial and\ncatastrophes of events and a social consensus about the meaning of the\nevent. Tracing the naming of what is now known as the Holocaust is one\nexample of how naming is often a matter of trial and error before\nthere is a consensus about which name is appropriate for the\nexperience that has traumatized a group and which that social group\nwishes to embed in its collective/institutional memory and pass on to\nfuture generations (1970a, 174). \nThe downgrading of the importance of the name in philosophy, for\nRosenstock-Huessy, has as its counterpart the downgrading of the\nvocative case and hence the dialogical component of truth. For\nRosenstock-Huessy, the vocative is the condition of dialogue and hence\nthe real condition of a new truth. Unlike philosophers, who generally\nbegin with the nominative case, he argues that a case such as the\nnominative is dependent upon, and hence subordinate to, the vocative.\n‘Vocatives create the preconditions for reciprocal\ncommunication; whereas nominatives and other cases take their place\ninside of communication. The vocative provokes the\nconversation’, he says in Ja und Nein (1968, 25).\nAnd: \nThis may be contrasted with the Socratic and more modern Cartesian\ntraditions. In these traditions the concrete self dissolves either\ninto the object to be studied or into the cognitive or methodological\nrules of the transcendental subject. In both instances the truth is\nthe objective fact or state of affairs. But for Rosenstock-Huessy what\nis being left out of this picture is the participative role we all\nhave in world-making and that role brings with it a knowledge and\nsense of our own purposefulness. What is so important is that creative\naddress requires being open to the unpredictable. The social world is\ngenerated by decisive acts of inspiration and history and is , inter\nalia, a tapestry of inspired and unpredictable acts. The more\npredictable a group’s actions become, the more spiritless they\nbecome. \nThis lack of emphasis upon the vocative is closely related to\nRosenstock-Huessy’s attempt to redress what he sees as the over\naccentuation of the modern faith in analysis, which is part of its\nphilosophical legacy and also part of philosophy’s aspiration to rule.\nAccording to Rosenstock-Huessy, the real sequence of orientation is:\nobey, communicate, explain, systematize. \nAnalysis, then, is the conclusion of a process. At no stage does\nRosenstock-Huessy claim that analysis or philosophy are completely\nunhelpful—but their benefits require that they are part of a\nlinguistic whole and that whole is what forms the social organism\nwithin which philosophy may play its role. According to\nRosenstock-Huessy, philosophy tends to mistake the part for the whole\nand wrongly assume that the small measure of reason we have is being\npowerful enough to be the measure of all. The process briefly\ndescribed above is what forms the collective ‘we’. This\nformation of the ‘we’ is at the basis of all common\nendeavors. It applies as much to the case of philosophers or natural\nscientists—for the group of ‘analysts’—as for\nany group. Science tends to concentrate on the array of its results\nand the application of methods and experiments etc. which achieve\nthem. However, no less real are the human and institutional processes\nthat are involved. The audacity of Galileo; the sweat and sacrifice of\na science student to learn difficult material; the solidarity in\npursuit of the truth about nature’s workings: these are all\nindispensable to science and enable scientists to share a common\npursuit and what Rosenstock-Huessy calls a particular\n‘present’ in a ‘time body’. As he writes in\nhis The Hegemony of Spaces: \nIn contrast to real speech, which is developed over time,\nRosenstock-Huessy sees that ‘philosophy talks to man as though\nthe experiment of living had not yet taken place before the\nexperiment, so to speak. “Reason” always argues before the\nevent, before our soul, has been incarnated, before God has come into\nthe world’ (1941, 6). Philosophy is able to occupy a zone in\nwhich our problems and its solution are\n‘eternalized’—it stops time and that shows in its\nsolutions. In sum, it is a-historical while our challenges and crises\nare in history and in time. \nAlthough other philosophers (in particular Heidegger, Schelling, and\nBergson) make time important, Rosenstock-Huessy was not at all\nconvinced that they had done it sufficiently. In the case of Schelling\nand Bergson it was because they remained imprisoned by the mechanistic\nconception of sequential time in which past, present and future move\nin the one direction. Thus, in the opening chapter of volume 2 of the\nIn the Cross of Reality, he takes issue with Schelling’s\ndeclaration in the Ages of the World that ‘the past is\nknown, the present cognized, the future intimated’ (2009, 2 16).\nWhile Schelling is a major critic of mechanistic philosophy, and his\ncall for a narrative philosophy is explicitly acknowledged by Franz\nRosenzweig as being one of the most important precursors of the new\nthinking, the notion of time expressed here is decisively sequential\nand not at all at odds with the mechanistic conception of time which\nhas evolved out of\n philosophy.[13]\n Such a representation of space and time as one finds in the new\nsciences of the philosophies of Descartes, Newton, and Kant (for all\ntheir differences), certainly enables the sharpening of our\nunderstanding and observation of causal or material process. However,\nsocially and personally we experience time as the push of the past and\nthe future. Our present is not simply a passing point on a one-way\nflow, but the intersection of past and future in our\npresent—future coming back to us as much as past coming toward\nus. Rosenstock-Huessy believed that this is how we experience the\nhistorical catastrophes which come from the conflict between\nsuffocating spaces and the freedom to found a new time. Heidegger’s\nemphasis upon thrownness and projection make him much closer to\nRosenstock-Huessy, but his substitution of historicity for real\nhistory, and hence real times, evident in the above discussion on\nnames, remains a dividing line between them. \nFor Rosenstock-Huessy, our temporal and purposeful nature is evident\nin our grammar and our institutions. Institutions are the embodiment\nand reproduction of a particular coalition of temporal forces.\n‘Without a multiplicity of times’, he says ‘I remain\nspeechless’ (1968, 12). Moreover, time and passion and history\nform an important connection which all come together in speech. Above\nall, time is experienced as history and this is as much so\nindividually as collectively. History is not simply a sequential flow\nof forces which have their naturalistic counterparts. Rather,\ndifferent events stamp themselves in the hearts and minds of a people\nand continue to impact upon a group long after their occurrence,\nthereby, at different times and to different degrees, activating\npassions of subsequent generations. Much of Rosenstock-Huessy’s work\nis devoted to the great ‘events’, the great catastrophes,\nand the time bodies ensuing from them which have given us our\nparticular historical character. More generally, this activation of\nthe passions by past events and the replacement of one pantheon of\nnames by another—as a hateful future is replaced by the promise\nof one more venerable—is a fundamental aspect of world-making\nand it is ultimately why, for him, names are so important. Names are\ntestimonies to events and, just as our speech is a means to activate\nus, they are the fundamental triggers of the passions and hence of our\nworld making. Names are the testimonies of what we love, of what calls\nus to act or of what has become so hateful that new directions must be\nopened up and new names found. History is a great pantheon of names,\nnames which are the registers of passions and total commitments past.\nWhen those names no longer em-passion then that component of a group’s\nhistory is dead. \nHowever, history is not simply a plurality of names. Rosenstock-Huessy\nargued that it also tends toward a common story, as speakers and\nlisteners are forced by successive catastrophes to become increasingly\nintegrated into common spaces and times and to see the connection\nbetween the times and hence between each other. Such a connection can\nonly be a real connection if it takes account of the bloody conflicts\nand the different responses and causes behind war and revolution as\nmuch as the moments and successes of common cause. That is, it must be\nmulti-vocular. However, being multi-vocular is not the same as being\nan archipelago of hermetically sealed cries; history provides the\ndifference between Babel (the interminable inability to communicate\none’s suffering and one’s love, faith, and hopes) and a possible\ncommon future. ‘All history is the tale of acts in which some\nspeaker and some listener have become one’ (1970a, 109). It is\nthe formation of ‘we ’. Thus, he says in Ja und\nNein, ‘we discover the founding act of life as the shaking\nup or shock (Erschütterung) of a man so that he is\nactivated, finally activated and called upon to join in the formation\nof history in his own name’ (1968, 26). \nWhat ultimately concerns Rosenstock-Huessy is incarnation and he\nbelieves that philosophy not only has not been sufficiently attentive\nto the process of incarnation and its historical importance, but that\nreligions, especially Christianity, have been far more successful in\ntheir fruits than philosophy—a claim he attempts to back up in\nhis historical writings on the Church and Christendom. Modernity was\nin many ways an attempt by philosophy to replace Christianity in\nEurope as an incarnatory force with its sciences and morals and art,\nin sum its humanism. But he believed—and this is the seminal\nevent overhanging all his thought—that the devastation of the\nWorld Wars had disproved its claim, and that humanism had discovered,\nbut not sufficiently digested, the truth of incarnation: that it is\nbased upon service to somebody. The nations became the gods of the\nmoderns. This had not been foreseen by those philosophers who had\ndivinized nature and/or the self. Nor had the pioneers of humanism\never envisaged a world in which monsters, such as Stalin, Hitler and\nthe like, would be as gods ruling over ‘selves’ and the\nsciences. \nThe matter of incarnation is central to Rosenstock-Huessy’s\nmagnum opus In the Cross of Reality. For it is this work that\nmost thoroughly examines love and suffering as the great drivers of\nhuman endeavour through their spatial and temporal incarnations. The\nfounding and perpetuation of new institutions which store our loves,\ncarry us across the times, and hence (when working well) replenish us,\nis, for Rosenstock-Huessy the real capacity for freedom that we bear.\nFor this drawing upon the times and being able to found new bodies of\ntime is our way of immortalising ourselves. Our world is what we make\nof it; our different historicities are our creations, our\n‘compositions’ that reach across the times.  \nThe scores of this composition, the histories, must be paraphrased in\nso many editions as there are generations of humankind. For the\ncomposition is recomposed in each generation by those whose love\novercomes a murder or a death. \nSo history becomes a great song, Augustine’s Carmen Humanum; in\nits every line, perhaps every tone, becomes a lived human life. As\nsoon and as often as the lines rhyme, love has once again become\nstronger than death. Then from out of absurd contingencies, from\nadverse circumstances, from silent events of epoch-making necessities,\nin which a lengthy ingested illness is finally confronted,\ncrossfertilized and consequently overcome (2008/9, 3: 513). \nThat this task is all too frequently eclipsed by more philosophical\nvisions of reality is for Rosenstock-Huessy in large part due to\nphilosophy failing to understand the ‘forces of community’\nwhich are constitutive of our reflexivity and activity. \nThe first volume of In the Cross of Reality, The Hegemony of\nSpaces, is primarily a work of method. It simultaneously provides\na critique of the philosophical inheritance that Rosenstock-Huessy\nargues distorts our social understanding or reflexivity and\nparticipation or actualization, whilst excavating more primordial\nelements, moods, and insights that emerge in social experience.\nRosenstock-Huessy’s argument is predicated upon the distinction\nbetween spaces of play and living spaces. He claims that play prepares\nus for life. Thus, like Horace Bushnell (whose work inspired him to\nrethink his earlier drafting of the first volume of In the Cross\nof Reality) and Johan Huizinga, he sees play as generating\ncrucial conditions of reflexivity. \nSocratic philosophy, with its turn to abstract distance and\ndefinition, confirms this for him. Socrates, says Rosenstock-Huessy,\nis the spectator who gives advice to the ‘athletes’ in the\nintermission (Rosenstock-Huessy, 2009, 1: 107). Rosenstock-Huessy\nargues that philosophy commences a spatially preoccupied way of\nthinking, which requires that living processes be stabilized. The\ncollective affirmations and directions of social appeals and socially\nagreed upon names become essences or substantiations processed by the\nphilosophical mind, which finds itself magically outside of the\nreality it processes. Philosophical reality becomes populated with\nmetaphysical entities such as the individual, subject, and object,\nappearance and reality etc. In this mentally sequestered space the\nmind is only beholden to its own elements and powers. Thus logic can\nbecome king in a philosophical world; while we on the earth remain\ncaught up in the forces that accompany the seismic events which shake\nus into new realities. The Hegemony of Spaces claims that\nthis philosophical preoccupation culminates in the mechanistic\ndissolution of the world into space (exemplified by Descartes’\nThe World): thus too the lived times which we register in the\ncalendar, in holidays, in days of remembrance and prayer etc. are\nsimply dissolved into the mechanics of a spatially derived time or\nsequential chronology. The response to this process of mechanization\nis exemplified by Nietzsche’s equally one-sided response to\nreality—the aestheticization of life and exaggerated emphasis upon\nthe will. \nFor Rosenstock-Huessy, the philosophies of Descartes and Nietzsche\nintensify the spatial ‘crampedness’ that is the outcome of\nthe spatial hegemony accompanying the triumph of abstract reflexivity\nover our play and life-spaces. Their different responses contribute to\na more spatially defined (more mechanized albeit more aestheticized)\nworld: modernity becomes a ‘tyranny of spaces’. \nIn so far as much of what has just been said has certain thematic\noverlaps and overlays with Nietzsche’s, and even\nHeidegger’s, critique of metaphysics, the last point should\nclarify how he differs from them. For Rosenstock-Huessy, while our\nspace-partitioning is secondary to our time-partitioning, and thus\nfounding of new ways to be in the world, he sees that the intersection\nof what he calls our trajective and prejective powers requires that we\nengage far more deeply with our historicity than either are prepared\nto do. \nCentral to this volume, and what is a fundamental departure from\nNietzsche, is Rosenstock-Huessy’s identification of the social\nprocesses and elements of tensional reciprocity that are intrinsic to\nour capacity for space partitioning. Thus, for example, whether it be\nthe family, the workplace, or the army, these institutions function\nprecisely because the members of each institution work on different\nfronts of reality. Ultimately the work is a critique of the kind of\nabstract understanding of sociality that sacrifices the reality of\ntensional reciprocity for a more uniform ‘picture’ of\nsocial reality, as he believes has become increasingly typical of\nmodern thought, irrespective of whether it is liberal, fascist, or\nMarxist. \nThe Full Count of the Times is essentially a work of\nuniversal history. It is devoted to exploring the distinctive social\norientations and formations and their enduring components and\ndevelopment. It claims to identify the past elements of recurrent\nexperience, the paths of ‘future-directed’ events and\ntheir mutual interplay or strengthening in the formation of\nworld-transforming institutions. In particular, Rosenstock-Huessy\ndwells upon how the discrete forms of antiquity and the peoples of\ntribes, empires, the Greek city states, and the future orientated\npeople of the prophets (the Jews) formed a hitherto unknown kind of\nsocial tensional ‘unity’ through their absorption and\nreconfiguration within Western Christian lands . He then seeks to\nidentify how that tensionality that had been formed through the\npresence and activity of the Church subsequently broke out and\ndeveloped, initially in Europe, into nations and then, through the\nworld wars, the planet as whole. \nRosenstock-Huessy always insisted that he was a Christian thinker. If\nhe is known at all by people in the English speaking world it is as\nRosenzweig’s ‘Christian’ dialogical partner and friend who\ntried, but failed, to convert Rosenzweig to Christianity. It is,\nhowever, important to understand what Rosenstock-Huessy meant by\nChristianity. The need to do this is also underscored by the fact that\nRosenstock-Huessy was a thinker who wished to explicate what it means\nto be a Christian in a post-Christian age, i.e. in an age where most\npeople not only no longer know what it means to be Christian but do\nnot know that they do not know, and yet, nevertheless, are far more\nChristian than they realize. \nRosenstock-Huessy’s Christianity has to be seen in light of his\ntreating all past human formations (whether of the tribe, the empire,\nthe polis, etc.) as vital compounds formed by the vocabularies, with\nall the expectations and summonings, of the people constituting them.\nThese vocabularies expressed the underlying realities which made them\npossible. Thus talk of Jesus’ divinity in Europe in the Middle Ages\nwas connected with, and testified to, the everyday world of churches\nthrough hymns, paintings, oaths and social office. Likewise Zeus and\nAthena were the conditions of the Greeks making the world they made,\njust as Horus and Osiris and the ka were for the Egyptians.\nTheir social classes, political powers, oaths, buildings, paintings,\nmusic etc. were not something extraneous to the powers they summoned,\nspoke of, or revered in their day-to-day actions. These respective\nages and the creations which defined them were impossible without the\ngods and the extraterrestrial powers that infused these worlds. And\nwith Rosenstock-Huessy, whether he was talking about burial sites and\ntotems, or Horus, and Osiris and the bestowing of the ka upon\nthe Pharaoh, or Homer and the Greek pantheon, or the Jewish decision\nto abandon the ways of empire, he was primarily undertaking an\narchaeological act of linguistic and sociological excavation to show\nhis readers what trials each people were responding to and how they\nhad all founded new forms of life which still resonate through our\nlives today, if we are but attentive enough to notice. \nFor Rosenstock-Huessy, what was unique about the Christian faith was\nthat it was a way of world-making dedicated to bringing all of human\nkind into one family based upon fundamental truths about suffering,\nlove, death, creation, redemption, and incarnation. For him, the\nChurch was big enough to embrace those with\n‘otherworldly’, childish understandings and those who\nunderstood that Christianity was a commitment to making the world on\nthe basis of sacrificial love. Whether rightly or wrongly he was\ngenerally puzzled and astonished at what he thought were the inane and\nchildish reductions that constituted the humanist and rationalist\nunderstanding not only of Christian life, but of all pre-humanist\npagan life\n forms.[14]\n Indeed, he generally associated this attitude with a non-historical\nunderstanding of humanity—one which he saw as widespread even in\nthe discipline of history—which so often simply transposed\ncontemporary orientations (names) back into the past and thus missed\nso much of the experience of humanity because it insisted upon\nascribing its own modern ‘denuded’ (humanist) view of\n‘man’ to worlds which knew nothing of ‘man’ as\nsuch. \nOne consequence of the triumph of humanism and rationalism, he\nbelieved, was that most moderns have simply forgotten what gods were.\nAnd he returns repeatedly to the term ‘god’ to bring out\nits sense as a power we serve which makes us speak, and guides our\nactions. In one particularly pithy formulation, which neatly captures\nthe thrust of the new thinking’s insistence upon God and Man as two\nirreducible subjects of historical predications, he says that\n‘God and Man is a reciprocal letter exchange’ (1968, 23).\nRestated in thoroughly secular terms and from our side, the forces we\nsurrender to in our lives make us what we are; we become what we\nserve; what we sacrifice ourselves to, makes us. \nThe failure to understand what a god is, for Rosenstock-Huessy, is on\na par with our widespread failure to see beyond our own horizon and\nunderstand the truths behind the animism of tribal peoples or the\ninsights into the moving heavens by early imperialist peoples. Thus it\nwas, he believed, that today so many, including so-called Christians,\nfailed to fathom the claims about Jesus’ divinity, which had to do\nwith the overpowering of death, not in any mystical or Pythagorean\nmanner of the continuity of the individual soul in a netherworld, but\nin the triumph over death and deadly forces through forming a body\nacross time, the Church. For Rosenstock-Huessy, Jesus was proof that\nCaesar and Pharaoh and ‘great men’ were not gods and\nJesus’ divinization meant that after him no one else would be God,\nthat our redemption was universal and mutual. Jesus’ taking on the\nrole of the crucified was to show us that we crucify God when we do\nevil to each other, and that we fail to achieve the maximum of our\npowers (our own divinity) in our failure to obey the law of love, and\nthat to obey the commandment of love means being continually prepared\nto leave abodes ruled by death and die into new forms of love and\nfellowship. \nFor Rosenstock-Huessy, the basic terms of Christianity emerged out of\npagan and Jewish historical experience, and this fusion was a source\nof great historical truth about how reality is formed out of suffering\nand love. Hence a huge part of Rosenstock-Huessy’s corpus is devoted\nto showing the reality and power—the truth—of tribal and\npre-modern imperial life (particularly Egypt) as well as the Greek\ncity states and the Jewish\n people.[15] \nRosenstock-Huessy also argued that Christianity emerged as a response\nto many of the same forces which created these other forms of life,\nonly at a different historical time, a time where their degeneracy and\ndeficiency had forced a new stratagem of social survival. The\nuniqueness of this new stratagem is that due to its peculiar fusion of\nsuffering, sacrificial love, death, and universal redemption\nit was able to reinvigorate and reconstitute forms once spent. It thus\nenabled the possibility of tribal peoples to harmonize with empires,\nand poets and philosophers to join with prophets in an attempt to\nrealize the New Jerusalem. (Rosenstock-Huessy refers to this song of\nBlake’s a number of times.) \nThis was what he meant by Christianity’s founding the full count of\nthe times due to its resuscitating ‘bodies’ from other\ntimes (see especially 1938 and 1987). Like Rosenzweig, who also\ninterpreted this combination of universalisation and redemption as the\nunending task of Christianity, Rosenstock-Huessy interpreted\nChristianity through the same broad triadic rhythm as Schelling:\nPetrine, Pauline and Johannine, where there is the movement from the\nChurch visible established by Rome, to the Church invisible of the\nReformation, to the Church fully devolved, yet alive, in modern\nsociety.  In Rosenstock-Huessy’s account, the first millennium of the\nChurch had created a widespread consciousness of love of the\nneighbour, having taken a faith of the Jews into the pagan world. By\nthe ninth century it had created what he calls ‘the\nworld’s first universal democracy’ in All Soul’s Day\nwhich declared that the soul of the poorest peasant or widow was as\nmuch loved by God as the pope or emperor and all lived in the\nknowledge of the judgment to come. By contrast, the second millennium\nhad been a connected series of ‘total revolutions’. These\nrevolutions involved the fierce actuality of last judgments, as people\nwho had lived with the promise of the second coming in their hearts\nhad reached such a state of hatred, desperation and lack, a hatred of\nlove’s and heaven’s absence in the society surrounding\nthem, that they had fought to bring heaven into the world. Each\nrevolution, while total in aspiration, had only been partial in\nsuccess. But the conditions of modern social and political freedom\nwere, he attempts to show in his two main works on revolution, the\nby-products of local revolts with total ambitions circulating in a\nworld that was being fused by a common history and destiny. The World\nWars were, he argued, the continuation of this revolutionary\nprocess. In sum, when Christ had said he had come to bring a sword,\neven though he was not urging the deployment of worldly means, the\nteaching of love that he had sought to place in the hearts of men and\nwomen had led to a series of convulsions and cataclysms that were\nforcing us to obey the law of love—or perish. These revolutions,\nwhich stretched from the Investiture Conflict (or what he calls the\nPapal Revolution) to the First World War and the Russian Revolution,\nhad given the modern world its shape. And, he believed, its solution,\nwhich was the fulfillment of the messianic promise to Abraham and the\nreal rationale for the Church’s very existence and which had\nbecome the real future-building mission of the (originally European,\nnow planetary, bodies) politics of the last millennium. \nThat solution was what he called a metanomical society, a planetary\nsociety in which discordances could be peacefully accommodated in\ncreative tension. In fact, while Rosenstock-Huessy remains completely\npassed over by what can loosely be called post-modernism (although he\nhad used the term as early as 1949, in his paper ‘Liturgical\nThinking’, as a way of describing contemporary life), he shares\ntwo major concerns with postmodernists: (a) the recognition that the\nglobal economy has reactivated the local and that any genuinely\ndesirable revolutionary outcome must be receptive to local customs\nwhich enrich people, and (b) that we will only be able to create a\nlife worth living at a planetary level if differences are not\ndissolved but able to retain their vitality. \nAccording to Rosenstock-Huessy the lesson of history and the\naccumulated memory (history) of human suffering gathered through our\nspeech-formed, time-building capacity was that we all must live as\nJew, Christian, and Pagan. In his The Christian Future and\nthe second volume of the Soziologie he would elaborate on\nthis by arguing that in our times we needed to fuse Christ, Abraham,\nBuddha and Lao Tse. His decision to make Buddhism and Taoism essential\ncomponents of the contemporary cross of reality was part of his\nattempt to help found a metanomical framework which would enable the\nconcordance of disparities. But it is fair to say that neither\nBuddhism nor Taoism, nor Islam (which he writes a section on in volume\n2 of the In the Cross of Reality), nor Hinduism occupied his\nattention anywhere near as much as the spirits of the tribes, Egypt,\nGreece, the Israelites and Christian peoples.","contact.mail":"wayne.cristaudo@cdu.edu.au","contact.domain":"cdu.edu.au"}]
