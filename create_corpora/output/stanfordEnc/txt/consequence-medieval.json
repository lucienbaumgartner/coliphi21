When\ndoes a sentence B follow from a sentence A? (For example, from\n‘Every human is an animal’ one may infer ‘Some\nanimal is a human’.) What are the grounds for the relation of\nentailment/consequence? Are there different kinds of consequences?\nThese and other questions were extensively debated by these\nauthors.\n\n\nTheories of consequence explicitly acquired an autonomous status only\nin the 14th century, when treatises specifically on the\nconcept of consequence began to appear; but some earlier\ninvestigations also deserve the general title of ‘theories of\nconsequence’, in view of their scope, sophistication and\nsystematicity. Taken as a whole, medieval theories of consequence\nrepresent the first sustained attempt at adopting a\nsentential/propositional\n perspective[3]\n since the Stoics in Greek antiquity, and — unlike Stoic logic,\nwhich had little historical influence — provide the historical\nbackground for subsequent developments leading to the birth of modern\nlogic in the 19th century. Indeed, it may be argued that\nthe medieval concept of consequentia (in its different\nversions) is the main precursor of the modern concept of logical\nconsequence.\n\nIn his much-discussed 1936 paper ‘On the concept of logical\nconsequence’, Tarski presents two criteria of material adequacy\nfor formal accounts of logical consequence, which jointly capture the\n‘common notion’ of logical consequence (or so he claims).\nThey are formulated as the following condition: \nIn more mundane terms, the two core aspects that Tarski attributes to\nthe so-called common notion of logical consequence can be formulated\nas: \nDifferent accounts of logical consequence can be (and have been)\nformulated on the basis of (TP) and/or (ST): they can be viewed as\nboth necessary but independent components of the notion of logical\nconsequence, as Tarski seems to suggest in the passage above; they can\nalso be viewed as closely related, in particular if (TP) can be\nreduced to (ST) (i.e. satisfaction of (ST) would entail\nsatisfaction of (TP) and vice-versa) — a view that Etchemendy\n(1990) attributes to Tarski; or one may hold that the actual core of\nthe notion of (logical) consequence is (TP), and that (ST) simply\nspecifies a particular subclass of valid consequences, often referred\nto as formal consequences (Read 1994). \nTarski correctly identified these two features as key components of\nthe notion of logical consequence as entertained by philosophers and\nmathematicians of his time (and also today). But the question arises:\nwhy these two features and not others? In particular, through which\n(historical) processes have they come to constitute the conceptual\ncore of the notion of logical consequence? These questions are even\nmore pressing in view of the fact that both features have\nbeen challenged as correct renditions of the conceptual core of\nlogical consequence — Etchemendy (1990) challenged the\ncentrality of formality and (ST); Fields (2008) challenged the\ncentrality of necessary truth-preservation in view of the semantic\nparadoxes. \nTo make further progress in these debates, an important element is\narguably the historical development of the notion of (logical)\nconsequence over the centuries, so that we may come to understand\nwhere the informal notion(s) of logical consequence come(s) from.\nEngaging in an exercise of ‘conceptual\nhistory’ may allow for a better grasp of the reasons why this\nnotion (now widely endorsed) established itself as such in the first\nplace. If these are compelling reasons, then they may count as\narguments in favor of the centrality of formality and necessary\ntruth-preservation; but if they rest on disputable, contentious\nassumptions, then the analysis may provide elements for a critical\nevaluation of each of these two components as truly constitutive of\nthe concept of logical consequence. \nFrom this point of view, the historical developments in the Latin\nMiddle Ages, in particular from the 12th to the\n14th century, occupy a prominent position. As will be\nargued, it is in this period that concepts and ideas inherited from\nGreek Antiquity (Aristotle in particular, but also the ancient\ncommentators) were shaped and consolidated into conceptions of\nconsequence that bear a remarkable resemblance to the Tarskian\ncondition of material adequacy presented above. Thus, an analysis of\nthese historical developments is likely to contribute significantly to\nour understanding of the current notion(s) of logical consequence. \nBesides variations of (TP) and (ST), criteria of relevance,\ncontainment, causation and explanatoriness also appear frequently in the writings\nof medieval authors (as well as earlier authors). As Normore (2015,\n357) puts it, there seems to be \nThis ambiguity is reflected in the different core conceptions of\nconsequence throughout the history of logic: is necessary truth\npreservation sufficient, or do we require something else, namely a\ndeeper causal (and/or epistemic) connection between antecedent and\nconsequent for the consequence to hold? Indeed, in addition to\nvariations of (TP) and (ST), there is a third recurrent theme in\nmedieval discussions on consequence: \nDifferent interpretations of this clause run through medieval\ndiscussions on consequence, ranging from the 12th to the 15th century\nand beyond. A number of authors seem to treat the notion of containment in metaphysical and/or semantic terms, while others (in particular the British\nauthors of the second half of the 14th century) lean more heavily\ntowards what appears to be an epistemic interpretation (see section\n3.4). And just as (TP) and (ST) still very much inform how most of us\nthink about (logical) consequence, variations of the containment\ntheme, as captured in (Co), remain pervasive among contemporary\nauthors, motivating for example the development of a number of\nrelevance logics (see entry on relevance logic in this\nencyclopedia). However, notice that (Co) is also interpreted metaphysically by a number of medieval authors; this metaphysical focus is not nearly as present among contemporary philosophers and logicians (with the exception perhaps of some of the recent discussions on the concept of grounding). \nNaturally, as with any historical analysis, an investigation of these\ndevelopments has intrinsic historical value in and of itself,\nindependently of its possible contribution to modern debates. Indeed,\nmedieval theories of consequence are a genuine medieval contribution:\nwhile medieval authors are clearly taking ancient Greek sources and\nideas as their starting point, the emergence of theories of\nconsequence as such is a Latin medieval innovation. But as it turns out, following the thread provided by the three key notions (TP), (ST) and (Co) as formulated above provides a suitable vantage point to\ninvestigate the development of the notion of consequence in the Latin\nMiddle Ages. In other words, historical and conceptual analysis can\neasily be combined in this case. \nAt first sight, it is not immediately clear what the object of\nanalysis of medieval theories of consequence is (Boh 1982). Is it the\nsemantics of conditional sentences? Is it the validity of inferences\nand arguments? Is it the relation of consequence, construed as an\nabstract entity? In fact, at times it seems that medieval authors do not properly distinguish between these different notions. After all, these are very different concepts: a conditional\nis a sentence, which can be true or false; an argument or inference is\nan act, a consecution of assertions, which can be valid or invalid; a\nconsequence is a relation between sentential/propositional entities,\nwhich can hold or fail to hold (Sundholm 1998). \nHowever, even though the medieval authors may use the same terminology\nto refer to these different concepts, this does not mean that they are\nnot aware of the relevant differences, in particular between a\nconditional and a consequence (Normore 2015). As Buridan\n(Tractatus de Consequentiis (henceforth TC), 21) remarks, it\nis for the most part a matter of terminology: he says he will adopt\nthe definition of consequence as a true hypothetical sentence, but\nthen throughout his text also uses the terminology of a consequence\nbeing valid or holding rather than simply being true or false. At any\nrate, it seems fair to say that, even though analyses of conditionals\nare often in the background (as is especially obvious in Boethius and Abelard with examples such as ‘if it is a human, it is an animal’, and in analyses of the syncategorematic term\n‘si’, ‘if’ (Spruyt 2018)), the main focus of\nmedieval theories of consequence tends to be the logical relations\nbetween sentential/propositional components (King 2001; Read 2010),\nessentially (though not entirely) in the spirit of modern accounts of\nthe notion of logical consequence (Shapiro 2005) (Caret and Hjortland 2015). Some modern scholars\n(e.g. Spade in his translation of Burley’s De Puritate; Read\n2010) prefer to translate the medieval term\n‘consequentia’ as ‘inference’, but\narguably ‘consequence’ is a more appropriate translation,\nboth for etymological and for conceptual reasons. \nOne may also wonder to what extent medieval theories of consequence\nreally add anything novel to the Aristotelian logical legacy. Kant\n(in)famously claimed that Aristotle had discovered everything there\nwas to know about logic, and insofar as they deal with logical\nrelations between sentences, it might be thought that theories of\nconsequence would not have added anything substantially new to\nAristotle’s theory of syllogistic in particular. In fact, the\nrelations between theories of syllogistic and theories of consequence\nat different times seem essentially to fall within one of three\ncategories: \nIt is fair to say that approach 3 became predominant in the\n14th century, the golden age of medieval theories of\nconsequence; but the earlier Boethian view that all valid arguments\n(including syllogistic arguments) are valid in virtue of topical rules\ncan also be seen as belonging to category 3. However, given that\nmedieval theories of syllogistic are treated extensively elsewhere\n(see the entry on medieval theories of the syllogism of this\nencyclopedia), in what follows we shall focus on non-syllogistic\nconsequences/arguments, but with the proviso that many of the\ninteresting developments in syllogistic in the 14th century\nare presented in treatises or chapters on consequence. \nAnother point worth mentioning is the fact that medieval discussions\nof the concept of consequence cover both what we would now describe as\n‘philosophy of logic’ and as ‘logic proper’.\nAs for the latter, a number of medieval authors such as Abelard\n(Martin 2004), Burley (De Puritate), and Buridan (TC)\nformulated rules of inference and proved theorems about them (Klima 2016). Many\nauthors had for the most part understood the logical behavior of what\nwe now view as the main sentential/propositional operators, such as\n‘if…then’, ‘or’, negating terms, as\nwell as meta-level rules such as the transitivity of consequence,\n‘from the impossible anything follows’, or ‘the\nnecessary follows from anything’ (the latter two were however\nnot unanimously endorsed — see (Martin 1986), (Read 1993,\n2010)). (For discussions of the rules formulated by different authors,\nsee (Pozzi 1978), (Boh 2001), (Dutilh Novaes 2008)). They also offered\nsophisticated investigations of the logical behavior of e.g. modal\nterms (Buridan, TC) (Johnston 2014). \nBesides this more technical layer, medieval authors also\ndiscussed extensively the very nature of the notion of consequence:\nwhat counts as appropriate grounds for a valid consequence, adequate\ndefinitions, subdivisions of kinds of consequence etc. In what\nfollows, the predominant focus will be on the ‘philosophy of\nlogic’ side of medieval theories of consequence, i.e. how they\narticulated this very notion, rather than on spelling out the exact\ninferential rules endorsed by the different authors. But some medieval\ntreatises on consequence also contain a high level of technical\nsophistication, even though the language used is the regimented\nacademic Latin of the time – the only symbolic device present is\nthe use of schematic letters, which in fact dates back to\nAristotle. \nOne of the most important ancient sources for the development of\ntheories of consequence by medieval authors is, unsurprisingly,\nAristotle. The Prior Analytics and the theory of syllogistic\nprovided the main model for the correctness/validity of arguments for\ncenturies, and even though theories of consequences can be seen as a\ngeneralization of the rather narrow theory of validity presented in\nthe Prior Analytics, it is clear that syllogistic remains one\nof the key elements in the background. Indeed, the famous definition\nof a valid deduction (syllogism) at the beginning of the Prior\nAnalytics is already a formulation of the necessary\ntruth-preservation criterion (TP): \nRetracing the historical sources for the development of this notion\nwould take us too far afield, but it seems that the emergence of the\nidea of ‘following of necessity’ is closely related to dialectical practices of debates (Dutilh Novaes 2021), both in philosophy/logic (Castelnérac and Marion 2009) and in mathematics (Netz 1999). But while it is a\nnecessary condition, necessary truth-preservation is notoriously not a\nsufficient condition for syllogistic validity. For example, as is well\nknown, Aristotle’s syllogistic does not validate the principle of\nreflexivity, i.e., ‘A implies A’ for any sentence A, even\nthough this principle is the most transparent occurrence of necessary\ntruth-preservation one can think of. Instead, it seems that\nsyllogistic validity requires a great deal more to hold (Thom 2010) (Thom 2016).\nInterestingly, Aristotle himself suggests that the premises in a\nsyllogism are the material causes for the conclusion\n(Metaphysics 1013b19–20; Physics 195a18–19),\n“in the sense of ‘that from which’”, thus\nsomewhat in the spirit of the idea of premises containing the\nconclusion expressed in (Co), and more generally the idea that the antecedent is the cause of the consequent (which would become widespread in the 13th century (Spruyt 2018)). Indeed, it has been claimed that \nIndeed, besides variations of (TP) and (ST), criteria of causation, relevance and containment also appear frequently in the writings of medieval authors. \nThe extent to which (ST) is present in the Prior Analytics is\nalso a moot point (Thom 2010) (Dutilh Novaes 2021). Aristotle does not apply the concepts\nof form and matter anywhere in his logical writings, but his\nconsistent use of schematic letters and many of his argumentative\nstrategies in this work suggest that he relies on something resembling\nwhat we now refer to as the ‘logical form’ of arguments.\nWhat is not clear is whether Aristotle relies on (ST) merely as a\nconvenient technical device to capture the more fundamental property\nof necessary truth-preservation, or whether for him (TP) and (ST) are\nindependent core components of the concept of a syllogism/deduction\n(or perhaps even that (TP) is to be reduced to (ST)). \nThe Prior Analytics is not the only Aristotelian text\nproviding the historical background for the development of the notion\nof consequence. Equally important is one of his (presumably)\n‘older’ logical texts, the Topics; this text,\nwhich even more explicitly than the Analytics clearly presupposes a dialectical\nbackground, presents various considerations on how to\nargue well in dialectical encounters (see the\nentry on ancient logic of this encyclopedia, section 2.1). By discussing which moves are allowed in a debate, it naturally ends up addressing the general idea of ‘what follows from\nwhat’ (Dutilh Novaes 2021). As we will see, the Topics became an important\nstarting point for discussions on the validity of arguments; the\ntheory of syllogistic only covers a rather limited range of arguments\n(two-premised arguments containing only the four kinds of categorical\nsentences), and the framework of the Topics was often called\nupon to fill in the gap between what syllogistic had to offer and the\nmuch larger range of putatively valid arguments one might be\ninterested in (Klima 2016). \nTwo other ancient traditions which may have contributed to the\ndevelopment of medieval theories of consequence are the Stoic\ntradition (see the entry on ancient logic of this encyclopedia,\nsection 5) and the tradition of the ancient commentators (Barnes 1990,\n2008; entry on the ancient commentators of this encyclopedia). But in\nfact, while a Stoic connection is prima facie plausible — unlike\nAristotelian term-based logic, Stoic logic is also largely\nsentence-based — historical evidence for direct Stoic influence\nremains elusive; for now, no record of actual channels of influence\nhas been\n identified.[4]\n The ancient commentators, by contrast, had significant (both indirect\nand direct) impact on the development of the notion of consequence\n— at first via Boethius, later via the Arabic authors, and as\ntheir commentaries were translated and read by the Latin authors in\nthe 13th century and onwards. \nWhile the notion of necessary truth-preservation was already quite\nmature in the Prior Analytics, the conceptual development of\nthe substitutivity criterion is essentially a later contribution of\nthe ancient commentators (Barnes 1990, 2008; Dutilh Novaes 2012a).\nRecall that Aristotle had not applied the metaphysical notions of form\nand matter to logical objects such as sentences and arguments in any\nsystematic way; this crucial step was undertaken by the ancient\ncommentators. References to the form and matter of syllogisms are\npervasive in their writings, especially in commentaries on the\nPrior Analytics, from that of Alexander of Aphrodisias\n(2nd century AD) up to that of Ammonius (6th\ncentury AD). The ancient commentators not only distinguished between\nthe form and the matter of syllogisms: they sometimes also suggested\n(though usually rather obliquely) that the form of an argument is\nprecisely that in virtue of which it is valid and reliable. This would\nlater pave the way for the distinction between formal and material\nconsequences and the idea of validity in virtue of form. Here is an\nillustrative passage by Alexander of Aphrodisias: \nAlexander also comments on Aristotle’s use of schematic letters, and\nclearly relates what takes the place of schematic letters to the\nmatter of the argument: \nIn first instance, the Greek logical heritage was almost\nsingle-handedly (though selectively) passed on to the Latin tradition\nby one man, the neo-platonic philosopher Boethius. Prior to the late\n12th century (Aristotle’s and other ancient texts became\nwidely read again in the Christian parts of Europe only in the\n12th century — see (Dod 1982)), what the medieval\nauthors had inherited from Greek logic had been almost exclusively\ntransmitted by Boethius, who had also established the logical\nterminology in Latin. His translations of Aristotle’s\nCategories and De Interpretatione were widely read,\nas well as his textbooks on syllogistic and his two texts De\nhypotheticis syllogismis (On Hypothetical Syllogisms\n– HS) (dating 516–522) and De topicis\ndifferentiis (On Topical differentiae — TD)\n(dating 522–523). \nBoethius uses the term ‘consequentia’ to refer to\nthat which a hypothetical sentence such as ‘If it’s day, then\nit’s light’ signifies: \nIt is from Boethius that later authors inherited the term\n‘consequentia’, but the influence of Boethius is\nnot only terminological. In HS, he focuses on conditionals of the form\n“If something’s (not) A, then it’s (not)\nB” (si (non) est A,\n(non) est B), and lists a number of principles and\nrules governing the logical behavior of such sentences (Martin 2009,\n66–78). Boethius’ considerations are not sufficiently worked-out\nas to be viewed as a full-fledged ‘theory of consequence’,\nand indeed there are a number of tensions and inconsistencies in his\ndoctrines. But HS will prove to be an important source for the later\ndevelopment of theories of consequence. For example, in this text\nBoethius introduces the distinction between natural and accidental\nconsequences, which then remains the main subdivision of consequences\nup until the beginning of 14th century (when it is surpassed by the\ndistinction between formal and material consequences) (Martin 2018) (Archambault 2018a). For Boethius, both kinds of consequences, natural and accidental, entail\ninseparability, roughly meaning that the antecedent cannot be true\nwhile the consequent is false (i.e. a version of (TP)), but natural\nconsequences entail something more, namely a real causal, metaphysical\nconnection between the items in question. \nThe other text mentioned above, De topicis differentiis, is\nequally significant for the development of later theories of\nconsequence. It presents a discussion of Cicero’s Topics,\nwhich in turn claims to have been inspired by Aristotle’s\nTopics. Cicero’s work, however, is very different from\nAristotle’s, and Boethius in some sense attempts to offer a\nunification of both approaches (he also discusses the dialectical\ntopics of the Greek commentator Themistius). One of the key concepts\nintroduced by this text is the concept of ‘maximal\npropositions’, which he claims are the general principles\nunderlying the correctness of topical arguments. As described by C.\nMartin, \nCrucially, topical arguments were originally seen as merely probable,\ncontrasting with the necessary truth-preservation of syllogisms. So\nfor maximal propositions to serve as grounds for the relation of\nconsequence, a transformation on the status of topical arguments (from\nprobable to necessary) had to occur at a later stage (Stump 1982,\n290). Moreover, it is important to notice that, although Boethius is\nfamiliar with the work of the Greek ancient commentators and\nincorporates some elements from their discussions, he does not\nexplicitly apply the form vs. matter distinction to syllogisms, as the\nearlier authors had done. Barnes (1990) suggests that the logical\nhylomorphism (i.e. the application of Aristotle’s doctrine of form and\nmatter to logic) of these authors is nevertheless present in Boethius’\nterminology, such as in the opposition between propositionum\ncomplexio and rerum natura (the structure of a sentence\nvs. the nature of things) (e.g. HS II ii 5). But Boethius does not\npresent the idea of substitution/variation of terms as a property\nrelated to the validity of arguments, as Alexander of Aphrodisias had\nsuggested. In other words, substitutivity of terms as captured by (ST)\nis not a key element of Boethius’ account of validity — neither\nterminologically nor conceptually. \nIt has also been suggested that Boethius was the first to formulate a\nversion of (Co) with respect to consequences (Green-Pedersen\n1984). However, on closer inspection, Boethius’ notion of\ncontainment is not really used to define or describe the relation\nbetween the antecedent and the consequent of a consequence (Bosman\n2018). Instead, the Boethian relation of containment in question seems\nto pertain primarily to metaphysical relations of containment between\ngenus, species and differentiae. For example, an argument based on the\ntopic from genus involves a notion of containment: the genus is taken\nto contain something that the species is then also inferred to\ncontain. For example, since all mammals are mortal, we can infer that\nhuman beings are mortal too: the genus ‘mammal’ contains something,\nnamely mortality, that the species ‘human being’ also contains (Bosman\n2018, 235). This metaphysical notion of containment then gives rise to\na related semantic notion, which establishes relations of semantic\ncontainment between concepts (Bosman 2018). The upshot is thus that\nBoethius does not seem to have had in mind a relation of containment\nbetween antecedent and consequent, but his observations on what the\nmetaphysics of genus and species entails for certain forms of\ninference may well have been the historical precursor of (Co). \nThe period from Boethius in the 6th century to Abelard in the\n12th century remains for now quite understudied, in particular as a consequence of the scarcity of extant manuscript evidence. As far as we can tell, the approach to logic in the 8th and 9th centuries appears to have been largely Platonist and metaphysical in character (Wilks 2016). Subsequently, a more linguistic orientation began to emerge, including investigations into inferential relations between categorical and hypothetical statements (Wilks 2016). It seems fair to say, however, that none of these investigations count as fully-fledged theories of consequence.\n \nIndeed, it was only in the\n12th century, with Abelard, that a\nnovel and highly sophisticated theory of consequence/entailment was to\nbe formulated. Abelard’s starting point is the same material inherited\nfrom Boethius which had been available for centuries, and yet what he\ndoes with it is quite extraordinary; in particular, he understood\nbetter than anyone before him the nature of what we now refer to as\npropositional operations. His treatment of the conditional and of the disjunction echoes what is now known as connective logic (Martin 2018) (see entry on connective logic of this encyclopedia). And yet, his account is ultimately untenable, as the resulting system is in fact inconsistent (Martin 2004) (Martin 2018). \nTellingly, his theory of consequence is presented in the part of the\nDialectica dedicated to the topical framework (the book\nDe Locis), which again illustrates the close historical\nconnections between theories of consequence and the Topics.\nAbelard speaks mostly of ‘inferentia’ rather than\n‘consequentia’, as the latter is for him a\nsubspecies of the former. He defines the concept of\ninferentia as follows: \nThe phrase ‘necessity of consecution’ could be viewed as\nAbelard’s formulation of the criterion of necessary truth-preservation\n(TP), but he seems to demand something more than mere\ntruth-preservation, namely a tighter connection of relevance\n(exigitur) between the senses of antecedent and consequent\n(Martin 2004, section II.5). Indeed, Abelard seems to entertain\ndifferent conceptions of the containment relation (Co) between\nantecedent and consequent: as a metaphysical (Dial. 255),\nsemantic (Dial. 253), and epistemic (Dial. 255)\nrelation. \nAbelard then further distinguishes perfect from imperfect\n inferences,[6]\n and this distinction sets him apart from the whole preceding\ntradition: \nHe goes on to argue that what warrants a perfect inference, i.e. its\n‘vis inferentiae’, is the construction itself:\n“‘the truth of perfect inferences comes from the structure\n(complexio), not from the nature of things”\n(Dial. 255). This is a novel development, as for authors such\nas Boethius and those following him, the warrant of all\nconsequences is ultimately to be found in the ‘nature of\nthings’, and is captured by means of topical principles.\n(Abelard then goes on to provide arguments directed against this\nBoethian view, see (MacFarlane 2000, A.4).) What Abelard refers to as\nthe construction/structure of an inference is indeed roughly what we\nnow understand as a schema (see entry on schemata of this\nencyclopedia), as his discussion of examples suggests: it is the\nsubstitution of terms by other terms while preserving the\nconsecution (i.e. a version of (ST)) that is the hallmark of perfect\ninferences. “Whatever terms you substitute, whether they are\ncompatible or incompatible with one another, the consecution can in no\nway be broken.” (Dial. 255, translation from Martin\n2004, 171) \nNow, while proto-traces of the substitutional conception of validity\ncould be perceived in Aristotle as well as in some of the ancient\ncommentators, with Abelard it is (arguably) for the first time\npresented as providing the grounds for a certain class of\nconsequences. And yet, Abelard’s conception of consequence is not\nreduced to (ST), given that imperfect inferences are just as\nlegitimate/valid as the perfect ones: imperfect inferences are those\nthat fail the substitution criterion but satisfy the ‘necessity\nof consecution’ criterion. Thus, for Abelard, (ST) defines a\nspecial subclass among valid inferences, but a combination of (TP) and\n(Co) remains the true core of his notion of inference/consequence (see\nDial. 283–4 for two senses of necessity of consecution).\nIndeed, in his subsequent discussion he deals with imperfect\ninferences much more extensively than with the perfect ones. \nMany of Abelard’s logical concepts were tacitly absorbed by later\nauthors, though not by means of direct influence, and often with no\nexplicit attribution to Abelard (Martin 2004). Ultimately, the\nAbelardian approach to consequences did not prevail (Normore 2015). It\nis revealing that we now have only one surviving copy of his\nDialectica, a clear sign that it was not widely read. \nThe two main features of 13th century logic are arguably\nthe emergence of the terminist tradition (authors such as Peter of\nSpain, William of Sherwood and Lambert of Auxerre/Lagny) and the\nabsorption of the newly rediscovered Aristotelian texts and other\nGreek sources, resulting in an extensive commentary tradition (Uckelman and Lagerlund 2016) The latter resulted in the distinction between three\ngroups of logical theories: what became known as the logica\nvetus (topics emerging from the traditional texts which had\nremained available throughout: the Categories, On\nInterpretation, Porphyry’s Isagoge); the logica\nnova (covering the material from the newly discovered\nAristotelian texts); and the logica modernorum (topics not\ndirectly related to the Aristotelian corpus, such as consequence,\ninsolubles and obligations). \nThe terminist authors did not address consequence as an autonomous\ntopic of investigation; their views on the matter are scattered along\ntheir analyses of sentences, the Topics, fallacies and\nsyncategoremata (the syncategorema ‘si’ in\nparticular) (Spruyt 2018). For 13th century authors, the two main types of consequence were natural and accidental consequences (Martin 2018); another frequently drawn distinction was that between simple and as-of-now consequences (Archambault 2018a). But one cannot really speak of full-fledged theories of consequence among the terminist authors, at least not if compared with what was to come in the 14th century. \nOverall, 13th century authors viewed the semantics of conditionals and the relation of consequence predominantly through metaphysical lenses; the main line of thought was that the antecedent had to be somehow causally related to the consequent (Spruyt 2018). These metaphysical relations continued to be conceptualized in terms of the framework from the Topics, as they had been by Boethius. Given this metaphysical focus, 13th century authors typically did not recognize (TP) as a sufficient criterion for a relation of consequence to hold; some stronger connection between antecedent and consequent was required, often conceptualized in terms of containment (Co). \nAlso significant for the overall development of the concept of\nconsequence is the increasing presence of Aristotelian hylomorphism in\nlogical contexts. While hylomorphism had not been entirely unknown to\nLatin authors prior to the rediscovery of the remaining Aristotelian\ntexts in the late 12th and 13th centuries, in\nthis period an explosion of applications of Aristotelian metaphysical\nconcepts in other areas occurred, especially in logic (Spruyt 2003).\nIn particular, applications of the form-matter distinction to\narguments (specifically, syllogisms) became frequent again, after a\nhiatus of many centuries since the ancient commentators. Such\napplications can be found in the only known 12th-century\ncommentary on the Prior Analytics, the Anonymus\nAurelianensis III (Ebbesen 1981), in the Dialectica\nMonacensis (an anonymous text of the early 13th\ncentury, edited in De Rijk 1962/7), and in Robert Kilwardby’s\ncommentary on the Prior Analytics (1230s — see (Thom 2007) (Thom 2019)),\namong other texts. The significance of these applications is that they\npaved the way for the consolidation of the notion of formal\nconsequence in the 14th century (Dutilh Novaes 2012b),\nwhich in turn was to have a huge impact on the rest of the history of\nlogic. \nIndeed, one of the earliest known uses of the phrase ‘formal\nconsequence’ can be found in Simon of Faversham’s questions on\nthe Sophistical Refutations, written in the 1280s: \nIt is significant that Simon refers to Averroes’ commentary on the\nPhysics, thus illustrating the importation of the\nAristotelian (meta)physical framework into logical analyses. We here\nhave the notion of ‘valid in virtue of form’ (as with\nAbelard’s ‘complexio’), and the association of\nform and formality with the idea of substitution of terms (ST). Other\nauthors of the same period, John Duns Scotus for example, also use the\nphrase ‘consequentia formalis’ and its variants,\nbut not in the substitutional sense of holding ‘in all\nmatter’ (Martin 2005). \nThis is the historical background for the consolidation of the\ndistinction between formal and material consequences in the\n14th century: a progression towards general theories of\nconsequence rather than exclusive focus on syllogisms, and the\nincreasing application of hylomorphism to arguments — at first\nto syllogisms, and later to arguments and consequences in general. \nThe precise historical origins of 14th century theories of\nconsequence are still debated among scholars. What we know is that, at\nthe beginning of the 14th century, treatises and chapters\nbearing the title De consequentiis and similar titles began\nto appear. Why then, and not before? Naturally, the subject itself,\nthat is, the logical/inferential relations between sentences, had been\nextensively discussed by earlier authors, as we have seen. But no\ntreatises or chapters were specifically dedicated to the topic or bore\nsuch titles before the 14th century. \nAccording to a once influential hypothesis, medieval theories of\nconsequences would have emerged from the tradition commenting on and\ndiscussing Aristotle’s Topics (Bird 1961; Stump 1982). At\nfirst sight, this hypothesis may seem plausible: traditionally, the\nrole of the topical framework was often to account for the patterns of\n(correct) inference and reasoning which did not fit into the\nsyllogistic system presented in the Prior Analytics. So,\nconceptually, it would seem quite natural that the tradition on the\nTopics might represent the historical origins of theories of\nconsequences. Moreover, as we have seen, most earlier discussions of\nthe notion of consequence (e.g. Abelard) were conducted explicitly\nwithin the context of the topical framework, following Boethius. \nHowever, on closer scrutiny, this hypothesis fails to receive\nhistorical and textual confirmation. (Green-Pedersen 1984, chapter E\nin particular) is (still) the most comprehensive study on this\nsubject, covering virtually every text known to us that is relevant\nfor the hypothesis. Green-Pedersen argues (1984, 270) that the late\n13th century literature on the Topics, that is, the period\nimmediately preceding the emergence of treatises on consequences,\ngives absolutely no indication of what was to come. In other words,\nthere are no significant similarities between the contents of these\n13th century treatises on the Topics and the\n14th century treatises on consequences. Therefore, we may\nconclude that the Topics could not have been the main, and in any case\ncertainly not the only, source for the emergence of 14th\ncentury theories of consequences. \nBe that as it may, the importance of the Topics for the development of\n14th century theories of consequences should not be altogether\ndismissed. It is worth noticing that two of the first\nauthors who presented systematic discussions of consequence in the\n14th century, namely Ockham and Burley, are both in some\nway or another influenced by the Topics. Burley explicitly says that\nall valid consequences are based on dialectical topics (On the\npurity, p. 158 and 162). In contrast, the relation of Ockham’s\ntheory of consequence to the topical framework is more convoluted; Green-Pedersen\nargues convincingly that Bird’s reconstruction of Ockham’s theory\nwithin the topical framework (Bird 1961) is not satisfactory\n(Green-Pedersen 1984, 268), but he also confirms that Ockham’s\n‘intrinsic’ and ‘extrinsic’ middles, crucial\nconcepts for his theory of consequence (to be explained shortly), are\nconcepts essentially taken (albeit in modified form) from the topical\nframework. \nIn short, although the current availability of texts still does not\nallow for definitive conclusions to be drawn, the picture that at this point seems\nmost plausible is that different strands of traditional logical\ntheories converged in order to give rise to the 14th\ncentury theories of consequences. It seems that at least four\ntraditions contributed substantially to these developments: treatises\non syncategoremata, especially in connection with the\nsyncategorema ‘si’; discussions of hypothetical\nsyllogisms; commentaries on the Prior Analytics; and the\ntradition of the Topics. Different elements of each of these\ntraditions contributed to the development of different aspects of the\ntheories of\n consequence.[7]\n Green-Pedersen (1984, 295) argues, for example, that the late\n13th-century treatises that most resemble early\n14th-century treatises on consequences are “the\ntreatises on syncategorematic words and a number of\nsophism-collections arranged after syncategoremes.” \nThe different 14th century treatises on consequences can be\ndivided into four main groups: \nChronologically, the development of theories of consequence in the\n14th century is thus characterized by an early and rather\n‘primitive’ stage (1), then by a stage of further\ndevelopment, in which, nevertheless, topical notions still play a\nprominent role (2), and then by two further traditions which run more\nor less parallel, namely the Parisian/continental tradition (3) and\nthe British tradition (4). While they differed in particular in the\nvarious definitions given to the formal vs. material consequence\ndistinction, they all agreed that necessary truth-preservation (TP) is\na necessary (but perhaps not sufficient) condition for something to count as a (valid) consequence\n(Dutilh Novaes 2008). \nBefore moving on, it is important to note that, in the 14th century, rules of\nconsequence were often discussed against the background of the genre\nof oral disputation known as obligationes (see entry on\nobligationes of this encyclopedia). It is common to encounter\nformulations of rules of consequence in obligational terms, for\nexample: if you have conceded the consequence and its antecedent, then\nyou must concede the consequent. Thus, interesting reflections on\nconsequence are also to be found in obligationes treatises\n(and vice-versa). \nWalter Burley is the author of the oldest treatise on consequence with\nknown authorship (edited by Brown in 1980), but it is in his later\nwork De Puritate, longer version, that one finds his fully\ndeveloped theory of consequence (Archambault 2018b). The shorter version of De\nPuritate is thought to have been composed before Ockham’s\nSumma Logicae, and contains only a section on consequence and\na section on syncategoremata. The received view is that,\nafter becoming acquainted with Ockham’s Summa Logicae, Burley\nabandoned the text of what is now known as the shorter version of\nDe Puritate and began to work on a new draft, which was to\nbecome the longer version (Spade 2000). The theory of consequence\npresented in the shorter version is based on ten basic principles,\nfour of which are clearly sentential/propositional, while the other\nsix take terms as the basic logical unit (Boh 1982). The only\ndistinction of consequence that Burley discusses is that between\nsimple and as-of-now consequence, a traditional distinction which\nremained popular in the 14th century: \nThis temporal understanding of the simple vs. as-of-now distinction is\nthe one adopted by most authors, both before and after Burley\n(however, see Pseudo-Scotus’ formulation, discussed in the next\nsection), and is repeated verbatim in the longer version of On the\nPurity… (p. 146). Another interesting feature of the\nshorter version is the fact that it treats syllogisms under the\nconcept of consequence, thus illustrating the absorption of\nsyllogistic by theories of consequences in the 14th\ncentury. Burley’s mature theory of consequence, as presented in the\nlonger version of De Puritate, is best discussed against the\nbackground of the theory of consequence presented in Ockham’s\nSumma Logicae, so let us now turn to Ockham first. \nOckham’s Summa Logicae is thought to date to the first years\nof the 1320s; section 3 of Part III is entirely dedicated to\nconsequences. In chapter 1 of III-3, Ockham presents a somewhat\nconfusing account of consequences based on nine distinctions,\nincluding the simple vs. as-of-now distinction; the distinction\nbetween formal and material consequence is the last one\n presented.[9]\n It seems that this important distinction was discussed systematically\nfor the first time in this very text (Martin 2005), but Ockham offers\nvirtually no justification for his use of the notions of form and\nmatter with respect to consequences. It is also possible that Ockham\ndeliberately ignores the well-entrenched distinction between natural\nand accidental consequences, given that he mentions nine\ndistinctions, but not this one. Here is how Ockham introduces the\nnotion of a formal consequence: \nThus, according to Ockham, formal consequences are those that hold in\nvirtue of middles, be they intrinsic or extrinsic. A\nconsequence holds immediately in virtue of an intrinsic middle when it\nholds in virtue of the truth of a different sentence formed from its\nterms. For example, ‘Socrates is not running, therefore a man is\nnot running’ holds in virtue of this middle: ‘Socrates is\na man’, since if ‘Socrates is a man’ is not true,\nthe consequence does not hold. These are typically enthymematic\nconsequences, i.e. consequences with a ‘missing premise’\n(with the additional premise, they become a valid syllogism). An\nextrinsic middle, by contrast, is a sentence not containing the terms\nthat form the antecedent and the consequent of the putative\nconsequence, but which is a general rule describing the\n‘fact’ that warrants the passage from the antecedent to\nthe consequent (reminiscent of Boethius’ maximal propositions), and\nwhich concerns the form of sentences. Ockham’s example of a\nconsequence holding immediately in virtue of an extrinsic middle is\n‘Only a man is a donkey, therefore every donkey is a man’,\nwhich holds in virtue of this general rule: ‘an exclusive and a\nuniversal with transposed terms signify the same and are\nconvertible’. \nNotice however that ‘Socrates is not running, therefore a man is\nnot running’ and ‘Only a man is a donkey, therefore every\ndonkey is a man’ are both formal consequences for\nOckham (since both hold in virtue of middles), whereas the former is\nclearly an enthymeme, not valid in all substitutional instances of the\nterms ‘Socrates’, ‘man’, and\n‘running’, thus not satisfying (ST) (see (Crimi 2018) on the extensional discrepancy between Ockham’s notion of formal consequence and Buridan’s (ST)-based notion of formal consequence). The latter, on the\nother hand, is valid in all substitutional instances of\n‘donkey’ and ‘man’, and indeed this seems to\nbe the case of most, if not all, of Ockham’s formal consequences\nimmediately valid in virtue of extrinsic middles; he explicitly says\nfor example that syllogisms are of the latter kind. Effectively,\nformal consequences immediately valid in virtue of extrinsic middles\nsatisfy the (ST) criterion of being valid ‘in all matter’,\nbut the same does not hold of Ockham’s (enthymematic) consequences\nvalid in virtue of an intrinsic middle. \nCuriously, while Ockham can be credited with having been the first to\nuse the terms ‘formal consequence’ and ‘material\nconsequence’ systematically, the content of his\ndistinction did not pass on to later authors. This is arguably because\nOckham’s distinction is cast in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic\nmiddles, peculiar concepts belonging to the Boethian framework which\nwas already losing its influence by Ockham’s time (Green-Pedersen\n1984). Indeed, one seldom encounters the concept of\n‘middles’ in writings of the post-Ockham period, except\nfor texts under his direct influence. \nAs for material consequences, it is not entirely clear how exactly\nOckham intended to define this class of consequences. He says that\nmaterial consequences are those that hold in virtue solely of (the\nmeaning of) their terms (Ockham, Summa Logicae III-3, ch. 1,\nlines 55–57) but the two examples he gives are of a consequence\nwith an impossible antecedent and a consequence with a necessary\nconsequent. This suggests the reading that this category consists\nexclusively of consequences of this sort (ex impossibili and\nad necessarium consequences), but there is no conclusive\nevidence supporting this interpretation; in particular, he did not\noffer any explicit motivation for his use of the concept of\nmatter to characterize this class of\n consequences.[10] \nAs mentioned above, the longer version of Burley’s De\nPuritate is thought to be largely a response to Ockham’s\nSumma Logicae, not exclusively but also with respect to\nconsequence. Burley recovers the natural vs. accidental distinction\nwhich had been deliberately neglected by Ockham (Archambault 2018b), but in fact\nformulates it with a terminology similar to that used by Ockham for\nformal consequences, namely in terms of the concepts of intrinsic and\nextrinsic topics (rather than ‘middles’, but this appears\nto be above all a mere terminological difference): \nNotice again the reference to the idea that the antecedent may\ninclude/contain the consequent (in natural consequences). One may\nconjecture that Burley sought to neutralize Ockham’s distinction\nbetween formal and material consequences in terms of intrinsic and\nextrinsic middles by formulating the traditional distinction between\nnatural and accidental consequences in terms of containment and\nintrinsic/extrinsic topics. Moreover, when discussing the notion of\nformal consequence later in the text (pp. 171–173, replying to a\npossible objection), Burley seems to be criticizing Ockham’s\ndefinition of material consequences as those which hold solely in\nvirtue of the meaning of terms: \nIn other words, Burley seems to be saying that Ockham’s formulation of\nthe distinction is ineffective and thus inadequate. The exact\nformulation of the distinction between formal and material\nconsequences presented by Ockham was indeed not adopted by later\nauthors, but it would be excessively speculative to attribute this\noutcome to Burley’s criticism. In effect, even less of a Burleian\nlegacy is to be found in later authors specifically with respect to\nconsequence, in particular as the formal vs. material distinction\nbecame the main subdivision of consequence later on (albeit under\ndifferent formulations). \nJohn Buridan’s treatise on consequence (TC, edited by H. Hubien in\n1976, English translation in (Buridan 2015)) quite likely represents\nthe pinnacle of sophistication for (Latin) medieval discussions of the\nconcept of consequence. Its modern editor dates it to the 1330s, thus\nbelonging to the early stages of Buridan’s career. We currently know\nmuch less about Buridan’s immediate predecessors than about Burley’s\nor Ockham’s, so it is not clear who Buridan takes inspiration from or\nis criticizing. The treatise is composed of four books: Book I\npresents general considerations on the very notion of consequence;\nBook II treats of consequences involving modal sentences; Book III\ntreats of syllogisms involving assertoric (i.e. non-modal) sentences;\nBook IV deals with syllogisms involving modal sentences. Each of them\nis remarkable in its own way (Book III for example represents a\nradical subversion of Aristotelian orthodoxy, with the suggestion that\nthird-figure syllogisms are more foundational than first-figure\nsyllogisms), but here we shall focus on the first two books (Book I in\nparticular), given the methodological decision of leaving syllogistic\naside in the present analysis. \nIn Book I, Buridan presents the general definition of a consequence in\nthe familiar terms of necessary truth-preservation: \nHe then goes on to reformulate the definition for reasons related to\nhis view that only actually produced sentences (sentence-tokens) can\nhave a truth-value (Klima 2004; Dutilh Novaes 2005). ‘No\nsentence is negative, therefore no donkey is running’ comes out\nas a valid consequence according to the criterion thus formulated,\nbecause ‘No sentence is negative’ can never be true: its\nmere existence falsifies itself whenever it is produced. According to\nBuridan, this example should not count as a valid consequence, and one\nreason he gives for this is that its contrapositive ‘Some donkey\nis running, therefore some sentence is negative’ is not a valid\nconsequence. He formulates a definition of consequences in terms of\n‘howsoever the antecedent/consequent signifies things to\nbe’ in order to accommodate such counterexamples, but adds that\nin most cases, the simpler definition is sufficiently accurate. \nCommitment to sentence-tokens aside, Buridan’s notion of consequence\nclearly has necessary truth-preservation (TP) as its fundamental component.\nSo for him, enthymematic consequences such as ‘a man runs,\ntherefore an animal runs’ are just as valid as syllogistic\nconsequences or other consequences satisfying the criterion of\npreservation of validity under term substitution (ST). However,\nBuridan does recognize that there is an important distinction between\nconsequences which do and those which do not satisfy the\nsubstitutional criterion; giving continuation to a tradition which\nincludes Alexander of Aphrodisias and Simon of Faversham, he\nconceptualizes this distinction in hylomorphic terms, more\nspecifically in terms of the distinction between formal and material\nconsequence: \nMaterial consequences are those which do satisfy the necessary\ntruth-preservation criterion (TP) but do not satisfy the\nsubstitutional criterion (ST) (Crimi 2018). At first sight, Buridan’s distinction\nbetween formal and material consequence seems very similar to, for\nexample, Abelard’s distinction between perfect and imperfect\ninferences. There is, however, a fundamental difference; nowhere does\nBuridan suggest that formal consequences are valid in virtue of\ntheir form, as Abelard had claimed for the\n‘complexio’ of perfect inferences (Dutilh Novaes and Bosman 2017). He does say\nthat the validity of a material consequence is made evident\nonly by means of a reduction to a formal consequence (TC, 1.4), but\nthis observation pertains to the epistemic level of how the validity\nof a consequence is made apparent to us, not to the quasi-metaphysical\nlevel of what grounds\n it.[11] \nBuridan also comments explicitly on what is to be understood as the\nform and the matter of a consequence: \nThe view that the form of a consequence/argument pertains to its\nsyncategorematic terms while its matter pertains to its categorematic\nterms is presupposed in both earlier and subsequent texts, but here\nwith Buridan it receives a rare explicit formulation. A modern version\nof this idea still survives, in the form of the doctrine of the\nlogical form of arguments and the modern preoccupation with logical\nconstants (Read 1994; Dutilh Novaes 2012a; entry on logical constants\nof this encyclopedia). However, it is worth emphasizing once again\nthat drawing the line between the form and the matter of an\nargument/consequence in this manner still does not entail the thesis\nthat the form is that in virtue of which a valid argument is valid;\nnor does it entail the thesis that only the\narguments/consequences satisfying the substitutional criterion are\nindeed valid. Buridan, in particular, does not hold either one of\nthese theses. \nIn the final section of Book I, Buridan formulates a series of general\nprinciples which follow from his proposed definition of consequence,\nsuch as that from the impossible anything follows (first conclusion;\nsee (D’Ors 1993 and Normore 2015) on Buridan and the ex\nimpossibili principle)), the principle of contraposition (third\nconclusion), and also many principles pertaining to the semantic\nproperties of the categorematic terms in a consequence (see entry on\nmedieval theories of properties of terms). Thus, here again we see\nthat medieval theories of consequence never completely abandon the\nterm perspective to adopt an exclusively sentential/propositional\nperspective. \nBook II of Buridan’s treatise presents a sophisticated analysis of the\nlogical behavior of modal sentences. Modal sentences can be either\ncomposite or divided, depending on where the modal term occurs: if it\nis either the subject or the predicate of the sentence, while the\nother term is an embedded sentence in nominalized form (in\n‘dictum’ form, in the medieval terminology), then the\nsentence is a composite modal sentence. If however the modal term\noccurs as an adverb modifying the copula, then it is a divided modal\nsentence. Buridan then proves a series of conclusions and equivalences\nfor each kind of modal sentences, such as that ‘B is\nnecessarily A’ is equivalent to ‘B is\nnot possibly not A’ (Johnston 2014). \nThe other treatises on consequence in the Parisian/continental tradition do not seem to depart significantly from Buridan’s overall analysis, with one possible exception: the commentary on the\nPrior Analytics formerly attributed to Scotus (edited in\nYrjönsuuri 2001), and whose authorship remains controversial. The\ndating is equally problematic; crucially, it is not clear whether it\nwas written before or after Buridan’s treatise, but some scholars\n(Lagerlund 2000, chapter 6) have argued that at any rate Pseudo-Scotus\ndisplays no knowledge of Buridan’s treatise (likewise, there is no\nobvious evidence that Buridan was familiar with Pseudo-Scotus’\ntext). \nThe treatise proceeds very much in the spirit of chapter 3 of Book I\nof Buridan’s treatise: a putative definition of consequence is\nproposed, but then quickly a counterexample is found, namely something\nthat should not count as a consequence and yet satisfies the\ncriterion, or the other way round (Boh 1982,\n 307–310).[12]\n But while Buridan rests his case after the third proposed definition,\nPseudo-Scotus goes on, and formulates a counterexample to the\ndefinition that Buridan settles on: ‘God exists, hence this\nargument is invalid’. If this consequence is valid, then it has\na necessary antecedent and a false consequent (since the consequent\nsays that it is invalid). But then it is invalid. In sum, if it is\nvalid, it is invalid; thus, by the consequentia mirabilis\n((A → ~A) → ~A), it is invalid.\nBut if it is invalid, it is necessarily so, since the premise is a\nnecessary sentence; therefore, we have a consequence with a necessary\nconsequent, thus satisfying the necessary truth-preservation\ncriterion, but which is plainly invalid. This has been described as a\n“proto-version” of Curry’s\n paradox.[13] \nMoreover, the Pseudo-Scotus treatise also offers an interesting formulation of\nthe simple vs. as-of-now distinction: in contrast with e.g. Burley,\naccording to Pseudo-Scotus this distinction applies only to material\nconsequences (recall that for him, a formal consequence is the one\nthat satisfies the substitutional criterion), and amounts to the modal\nvalue of the missing premise that can be added in order to turn the\n(enthymematic) consequence into a formal one. That is, if the missing\npremise is a necessary sentence, then the consequence is an\nabsolute/simple one. But if the missing premise is a contingent truth\n(it has to be true with respect to the time indicated by the verbs of\nthe consequence, otherwise the original material consequence does not\nhold), then the original material consequence holds only in some\nsituations, namely the situations in which the contingent sentence\nhappens to be true, and is thus an as-of-now consequence. The same\nformulation of the simple vs. as-of-now distinction can be found in\nBuridan’s treatise, Book I chapter 4, which again illustrates the\nconceptual connection between the two texts. \nIn the British tradition, which is then continued in Italy in the late\n14th century and 15th century (Courtenay 1982),\nthe definition of consequence in terms of necessary truth-preservation\n(TP) is also unanimously adopted, as for example in Billingham\n(Billingham/Weber 2003, 80), Strode (cited in (Pozzi 1978, 237)) and\nPaul of Venice (Logica Parva, p. 167). In fact, these authors\npresent variations of (TP) without much discussion or analysis,\ncontrary to what is found in Buridan’s treatise, for example. More\ngenerally, the treatises in this tradition are characterized by a\nlesser degree of conceptual sophistication if compared to the earlier\ntreatises by Ockham, Burley or Buridan. The goal seems to be mostly\npedagogical, i.e. presenting ‘rules of thumb’ to argue\ncorrectly, rather than presenting a systematic, conceptual analysis of\nthe concept of consequence. \nStill, what is characteristic of this tradition is a specific\ninterpretation of the idea of the conclusion being\ncontained/understood (intelligitur) in the premises —\nthat is, condition (Co) – which these authors rely on\nextensively to define the concept of formal consequence. We have seen\nthat for Abelard, something like (Co) is a necessary condition for all\nconsequences/inferences, which Martin (2004) spells out in terms of a\ncriterion of relevance. 13th century authors, such as\nKilwardby (for whom (Co) provided the definition of natural\nconsequences) and Faversham, also discussed variations of this idea\n(Read 2010, 177/8), but prior to the late 14th century, it\nwas not always formulated in epistemic/psychological terms. The\nauthors in the 14th century British tradition typically\nformulate the definition of formal consequence on the basis of\nvariations of (Co), but giving it a very explicitly epistemic\ntwist. \nLavenham, for example, says (as quoted in King 2001, 133): “A\nconsequence is formal when the consequent necessarily belongs to the\nunderstanding of the antecedent, as it is in the case of syllogistic\nconsequence, and in many enthymematic consequences”. Strode\npresents a similar formulation: \nSeveral other authors formulated similar definitions, such as\nBillingham (Weber 2003, 80) and Fland (Fland/Spade 1976). Normore\n(1993, 449) argues that a significant transformation occurred in the\n14th century British tradition, which “puts in play\nthe idea that deduction is not an objective relation between abstract\nobjects or sentences but a mental operation performed on the bases of\nwhat can be understood or imagined.” This is noticeable not only\nin the definitions of formal (as opposed to material) consequence, but\nalso in the very definitions of consequence which begin to mention\nmental acts, such as: “a consequence is a derivation\n(illatio) of the consequent from the antecedent”\n(Strode, quoted in Normore 1993, 449). \nThe epistemic/psychological interpretation of these formulations of\nformal consequences has not gone uncontested; arguably, they are\nequally compatible with a semantic interpretation emphasizing\nthe signification of sentences (Read 2010, 178). But it is clear that,\nwhile the Parisian tradition defined the concept of formal consequence\nin terms of (ST), the British tradition formulated the same concept in\nterms of (Co). Both were ideas that had been floating around for\ncenturies, but which yield very different conceptions of what counts\nas a formal consequence. These two approaches are not only\nintensionally divergent; they also disagree on the extension of the\nclass of formal consequences. (ST)-formal consequences do not include\nenthymematic consequences such as ‘Socrates is a man, therefore\nSocrates is an animal’, but (Co)-formal consequences typically\ndo. For British authors, the class of material consequences is often\ncomposed exclusively of consequences of the kind ‘from the\nimpossible anything follows’ and ‘the necessary follows\nfrom anything’, which satisfy the truth-preservation criterion\n(TP) a fortiori, but typically fail relevant/containment\ncriteria. ‘God does not exist, therefore you are a donkey’\ncounts as a valid consequence according to (TP) (‘God does not\nexist’ is considered to be an impossible sentence), but the\nconsequent is not contained in the antecedent in the same way as in\n‘Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is an animal’. To\nmark this distinction, 14th century British authors would\ntypically view the former as a material consequence and the latter as\na formal consequence (Ashworth & Spade 1992). \nWe started by surveying the ancient background for the emergence of\nLatin medieval theories of consequence, in particular Aristotle’s\nTopics and Prior Analytics, the commentaries by the\nancient commentators, and Boethius’ influential logical texts.\nTheories of consequence only became an autonomous topic of\ninvestigation in the 14th century, but previous\ndevelopments, in particular Abelard’s theory of inference/entailment\nand the increasing application of hylomorphism to logic in the\n13th century, are equally deserving of attention.\nNevertheless, the golden age for theories of consequence was\nthe 14th century, when different theories were proposed by\nBurley, Ockham, Buridan, Billingham, Strode, Paul of Venice, and many\nothers. As with much of scholastic logic, the topic of consequence\ncontinued to be explored in the 15th century and beyond\n(Ashworth 1974, chapter III), providing the background for much of\nwhat was to come in the history of logic, in particular the persistent\nassociation between logic and forms (MacFarlane 2000).","contact.mail":"cdutilhnovaes@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
