To a large extent inspired by the writings of\nhis academic teacher Moritz Schlick, Feigl delivered important\ncontributions to the philosophical analysis of probability, to the\ndebate over scientific realism, and to the analysis of the mind-body\nproblem. His overarching aim was to inform established philosophical\nanalysis by what he called the “scientific\nattitude.” \n\n\n\nHerbert Feigl was born on December 14, 1902, in the then Austrian\ntown of Reichenberg (nowadays Liberec, Czech Republic). Feigl’s\nparents were Jewish, but not religious. His father, a trained weaver,\nwas said to be an ardent atheist; he was a skillful and highly\ningenious textile designer and became later in his career one of the\nmost influential leaders in the Austrian textile industry.\nFeigl’s mother, who had a lifelong interest in the arts, filled\nhim with enthusiasm for classical music, particularly for the\nsymphonies of Anton Bruckner and Gustav Mahler. In 1921, Feigl began to\nstudy mathematics, physics, and philosophy at the University of Munich.\nBecause of the anti-Semitic climate in Germany (and in particular in\nMunich) he moved, in 1922, to the University of Vienna where he studied\nunder Moritz Schlick, Hans Hahn, Hans Thirring, and Karl Bühler.\nIn the very same year, he wrote an essay on the philosophical\nsignificance of Einstein’s theory of relativity for which he\nobtained a prize in a competition (with Schlick, Ernst von Aster and\nMax von Laue as referees). In 1924, Feigl became one of the co-founders\nof the Vienna Circle. In 1927, he finished his doctoral dissertation in\nphilosophy on the relationship between chance and law in the natural\nsciences. Inspired by discussions with Karl Popper and Hans\nReichenbach, Feigl, in 1929, published the monograph Theorie und\nErfahrung in der Physik. In the same year, he gave a series of\nlectures at the Bauhaus in Dessau, between which and the Vienna Circle\nthere were interesting parallels in both intellectual outlook and\npolitical approach (see Galison 1990). In 1930 Feigl married Maria\nKasper, a fellow student at the University of Vienna, and had a son\n(Eric Feigl). \n\nFor reasons of anti-Semitism and occupational hopelessness, Feigl,\nin 1930, decided to emigrate to the United States. Funded by a\nRockefeller Research Fellowship, he first stayed for eight months at\nHarvard University. Together with Albert E. Blumberg he wrote the\nprogrammatic article “Logical Positivism: A New Movement in\nEuropean Philosophy” (published in the spring of 1931 in the\nJournal of Philosophy). From 1931 to 1937 Feigl taught as a\nlecturer and assistant professor at the University of Iowa. In 1937, he\nwas granted US citizenship. From 1938 to 1940 he served as an associate\nprofessor at the University of Iowa. Eventually, in 1940, Feigl\nreceived a full professorship at the University of Minnesota in\nMinneapolis. There he founded in 1953 the Minnesota Center for the\nPhilosophy of Science which was the first center of that kind in the\nUnited States and which is still one of the leading institutions for\nresearch in the history and philosophy of science. \n\nApart from guest professorships in Berkeley (1946 and 1953), at\nColumbia University (1950) and at the University of Hawai’i (1958),\nFeigl had research stays in Mexico, Australia, and Austria. He was\npresident of the American Philosophical Association and vice president\nof the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Among the\nmajor works during his time in the United States are writings on\nmethodology, on the scientific realism debate and a couple of\ncontributions to the mind-body problem, the most well-known of which is\nthe essay “The ‘Mental’ and the\n‘Physical’” (1958). After his retirement in 1971,\nFeigl was still active as an organizer of philosophical discussions at\nhis private home. He died of cancer on June 1, 1988, in Minneapolis.\n  \n\nAs already indicated, Feigl was a member of the Vienna Circle from\nits very beginning. Together with Friedrich Waismann he had suggested\nto Schlick the formation of an evening discussion group (see Feigl\n1981, p. 60). Schlick took over the idea and installed a Thursday\nevening colloquium in the Vienna Boltzmanngasse 5, the location of the\nUniversity’s Department of Mathematics. Among the co-founders of\nthe Circle were, besides Waismann and Feigl himself, Hans Hahn, Otto\nNeurath, Olga Hahn-Neurath, Viktor Kraft, Felix Kaufmann, and the\nmathematician Kurt Reidemeister. It was the latter who proposed the\nreading and discussion of Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Tractatus\nlogico-philosophicus. As Feigl reported in an unpublished\ninterview, \n\nHowever, the reading of Wittgenstein’s Tractatus was\nonly one of a number of topics discussed within the Circle. According\nto Feigl, “about 60 % of our time was devoted to the problems of\nthe foundation of mathematics and the rest to philosophy of science and\nepistemology” (ibid.). Between 1926 and 1928 it was the reading\nof (the typescript of) Rudolf Carnap’s Der logische Aufbau\nder Welt which dominated the discussion.  \n\nAs for Feigl’s own development, his doctoral dissertation\nunder Schlick’s supervision should be mentioned first. Submitted\nin July1927, the purpose of this study was to examine the problem of\nthe application of the probability calculus, hence its title\n“Chance and law: an epistemological analysis of the roles of\nprobability and induction in the natural sciences.” Heavily\ninspired by Edgar Zilsel’s Das Anwendungsproblem (1916),\nFeigl argued along pragmatic (Humean) lines. His central thesis was\nthat the problem of induction cannot be solved by making recourse to\nthe probability concept. Feigl, thereby criticizing especially the\npoint of view defended by Hans Reichenbach, proposed instead a\n‘vindication’ rather than a ‘validation’ of\ninductive reasoning. Relying on a frequency interpretation of\nprobability, he argued that the limiting value of an infinite sequence\ncan only be inferred inductively, which in turn implied that\nprobability is dependent on induction and not vice versa.\nConcerning the principle of induction itself, Feigl (like his teacher\nSchlick) saw no other possibility than to interpret it as a pragmatic\n(or operational) maxim. On the whole, however, the approach laid down\nin Feigl’s dissertation was, as Feigl himself later conceded (see\nFeigl 1981, p. 6), severely limited by its neglect of the simultaneous\nrise and development of quantum mechanics.  \n\nIt was in the 1929 book Theorie und Erfahrung in der Physik\nthat Feigl reflected on the philosophical significance of quantum\nmechanics. In addition he elaborated on the more general issues of\nscientific explanation and the hypothetico-deductive method in theory\nconstruction, thereby informally anticipating ideas later developed in\nmore detail by Karl Popper and especially by Carl Gustav Hempel. On the\nprogrammatic level, Feigl criticized both Kantianism and\nconventionalism and argued, positively, for a ‘critical\nrealist’ approach to the relationship of theory and experience in\nphysics. The book, which received favorable reactions by practicing\nphysicists such as Albert Einstein and Wolfgang Pauli, was\nFeigl’s only book in German language (and his only monograph at\nall). Its exposed position with respect to programmatic outlook Feigl\nretrospectively described as follows: \n\nThat Schlick was converted to “phenomenalistic\npositivism” might be contested (see Geymonat 1985); but, beyond\nthe shadow of a doubt, Feigl’s realistic reconstruction of the\ntheories of physics had a minority status within the Vienna Circle.\nAfter his emigration to the United States, Feigl devoted much of his\nwork to developing a stable realist stance.  \n\nIt is commonly supposed that logical empiricism and scientific\nrealism are systematically at odds. However, Feigl’s diverse\ncontributions to the scientific realism debate just suggest the\nopposite: Influenced by the early ‘critical’ realism of his\nteacher Schlick, Feigl (like Reichenbach and Eino Kaila) argued in\nterms of a reconciliation of both positions, that is, he attempted to\ncombine logical empiricist methods with a scientific realist account of\ntheoretically postulated entities (see, in this connection, also Neuber\n2012, esp. pp. 45–51, and especially Neuber 2018, ch. 5). \n\nTo begin with, in their 1931 article “Logical Positivism: A\nNew Movement in European Philosophy,” Feigl and Blumberg\npresented the logical positivist approach as the synthesis of two\n“significant traditions” (Feigl/Blumberg 1931, p. 281): the\nclassical “positivistic-empirical” current in European\nphilosophy, and the development of modern (mathematical) logic. The\nmost characteristic feature of the emerging “new movement”\nwas, according to Feigl and Blumberg, its conception of the\npropositions of metaphysics as “meaningless” (ibid., p.\n282). This diagnosis also pertained to Kant’s account of\nsynthetic a priori judgments, the existence of which was\nexplicitly contested. However, it must be seen that Feigl never went as\nfar as to reject the analytic/synthetic distinction as such. As he\nlater argued against Quine, “[t]he revolt against the dualism of\nthe analytic and the synthetic rests on a confusion of the logical\nanalysis of (artificially fixed) languages with the historical\ninvestigation of (growing, shifting natural) languages” (Feigl\n1956, p. 7–8). Thus, in the logical positivist account, analytic\npropositions had to be sharply distinguished from synthetic\npropositions. Whereas the latter had their place in experience and\nexperiential science, the former belonged to logic and mathematics.\nMore precisely, Feigl and Blumberg agreed with Wittgenstein that logic,\nby its very nature, is purely tautological. It has nothing to do with\nexperience, but only with the internal structure of language. Here,\nthey saw the principle advantage over previous, traditional, empiricist\naccounts of logic and mathematics. Moreover, Feigl and Blumberg\nmaintained that even the concepts of the empirical sciences are such as\ncan be subject to a purely formal, logical, reconstruction. Relying on\na principled distinction between “knowledge proper”\n(Erkenntnis) and objectivity, on the one hand, and\n“immediate experience” (Erlebnis) and\nsubjectivity, on the other, they referred the reader to Carnap’s\nDer logische Aufbau der Welt, thereby implying that a\nconstitution of empirical concepts from a single primitive relation,\nnamely that of “Ähnlichkeitserinnerung”, by\n“purely logical operations” (Feigl/Blumberg 1931, p. 286)\nwas at least in sight. The essential point in this connection was that\nthe propositions of empirical science were supposed to be translatable\ninto a series of propositions which exclusively referred to structural\nfeatures of experience, but not to the experientally given itself\n(which was conceived of as completely subjective and thus\n‘private’). It was therefore structure which stood in the\nfocus of the respective reconstruction of empirical knowledge.\nKnowledge, according to Feigl and Blumberg, is to be defined as\n“the communicable” (ibid.) and “[w]hat knowledge\ncommunicates is structure […].” (ibid.) \n  \n\nIt was just a few years later that Feigl—rather\nsignificantly—modified his point of view. Or, as he himself\nreports: \n\nThe programmatic impact of the distinction drawn here by Feigl\nbetween ‘logical positivism’ and ‘logical\nempiricism’ might be doubted (see Uebel 2013). However, in order\nto adequately understand the line of Feigl’s philosophical\ndevelopment, the distinction is quite apt. Thus, in the first instance,\nit was the liberalization of the logical positivist criterion of\nmeaning which caused a shift in Feigl’s general philosophical\noutlook. According to the early, logical positivist, conceptions of\nlanguage and science, the meaning of a proposition must be anchored in\nobservable facts. More precisely, the meaning of a given proposition is\nentirely exhausted by its verification on a purely observational basis.\nYet it turned out, as a major consequence of the Vienna Circle’s\nprotocol-sentence debate (see Uebel 2007), that this criterion was far\ntoo strict. Direct verifiability was (by Carnap, Hempel, and others)\nsubstituted through weaker criteria such as (at least indirect)\ntestability (see Carnap 1936/37) or confirmability and\ndisconfirmability (see Hempel 1935; 1945; 1950a). Nevertheless, the\nlogical positivists’ rejection of metaphysics remained\nquintessentially intact. As Feigl points out in a paper titled\n“Scientific Method without Metaphysical Presuppositions”\n(1954), there are two senses in which the term\n‘metaphysics’ appears objectionable also from the\nliberalized, logical empiricist, perspective; namely a) the assertion\nof transcendent, i.e., in principle untestable statements, and b) the\nbelief in factual truths that could be validated a prioiri, i.e., in\ncomplete independence of the data of observation. In both cases, the\nrealm of the meaningful is distinguished from these two objectionable\nregions. \n\nAnother, systematically more far-reaching aspect of Feigl’s\n(self-ascribed) shift from logical positivism to logical empiricism was\nhis increasingly explicit embrace of a ‘realist’ approach\nto science and scientific theory construction. In Feigl’s own\nwords: \n\nIt was as early as 1935 that Feigl, at the above quoted\nInternational Congress for the Unity of Science in Paris, gave a talk\non “Sense and Nonsense in Scientific Realism” (see Feigl\n1936; further Neuber 2011, p. 169). In 1943, then, he published a paper\ntitled “Logical Empiricism.” There, he argued that the term\n‘real’ is employed with good reason (both in daily life and\nin science) to designate “that which is located in space-time and\nwhich is a link in the chains of causal relations” (Feigl 1949,\np. 16). In this sense, the reality of atoms (and other theoretically\npostulated entities) is equally capable of empirical test as the\nreality of rocks and trees. Accordingly, reality should be ascribed to\nwhatever is confirmed as having a place in the spatiotemporal-causal\nsystem. After all, this—realistically inspired—point of\nview directly emerged from the liberalization of the logical\nempiricists’ criterion of meaning. It was indeed the result of\nthe insight that “most of our knowledge, and especially almost\nall of the more interesting and important part of it, is highly\nindirect. It is shot through with interpretation, construction, and\ninference, and consequently is dependent on very general\nassumptions” (ibid., p. 14).  \n\nHowever, Feigl’s mature conception of a synthesis of\nscientific realism and logical empiricism is to be found in his 1950\narticle “Existential Hypotheses” (published in\nPhilosophy of Science). There, it was semantics which\nserved as the vehicle for Feigl’s promotion of the realist\nproject. By ‘semantics,’ Feigl meant (in a nutshell) the\nformal scrutiny of reference and truth (see Feigl 1950a, p. 36). As\nsuch, it had nothing to do with the concrete methods of testing\nhypotheses. Rather, “semantic realism,” as Feigl pointed\nout at another place, “is concerned only with the most abstract\nand formal features of the semiotic situation” (1950b, p. 192).\nThis implied, in particular, that a) reference must be sharply\ndistinguished from evidence, and that b) truth must be sharply\ndistinguished from verification. It was on this basis that Feigl saw\nhimself in a position to avoid “the reductive fallacies of\nphenomenalism” (1950a, p. 35). By the “reductive fallacies\nof phenomenalism,” he meant the logical constructionist accounts\nof Bertrand Russell (1914) and the early Carnap (1928). In\nRussell’s and Carnap’s view, the theoretical statements of\nthe empirical sciences were, at least according to Feigl,\n“considered as translatable into statements concerning the data\nof direct experience” (1950a, p. 35). This conception was, in\nFeigl’s eyes, “fallacious” because the assumption of\ncomplete translatability was, he thought, semantically misguided.\nTheoretical sentences should be invested with what Feigl called their\n(so to say ‘untranslatable’) “surplus meaning.”\nThis surplus meaning he considered to consist in the “factual\nreference” of theoretical terms (ibid., p. 48). More concretely,\nFeigl was convinced that terms like ‘atom,’\n‘force,’ or ‘electromagnetic field’ cannot be\nreduced to purely observational terms describing our direct\nexperiences. Rather, theoretical terms were supposed to refer to\nunobservable, mind-independent entities, so that, for example, the\nreferent of the term ‘atom’ would be real atoms and not\nsamples of ‘logical constructions’ out of sense data (or\nother kinds of directly perceivable things). Therefore, Feigl urged\nthat “we must distinguish between the radical empiricist’s\nmeaning of ‘meaning’ (i.e., epistemic reduction) and\nanother, more common-sensical meaning of ‘meaning’ (factual\nreference)” (ibid., p. 49).  \n\nIt has (very aptly) been remarked that Feigl’s “semantic\nrealism is an anti-reductive position” (Psillos 1999, p. 12). It\nis anti-reductive insofar as the theoretical language of science is\nclaimed to be autonomous in relation to the observational evidence\nbase. Consequently, the mind-independence of the ‘factual\nreferents’ of theoretical terms seems to be secured by the very\nreference relation itself: the existence of theoretical entities like\natoms is obviously implied by the independent reference of theoretical\nterms like ‘atom.’ \n\nMoreover, Feigl’s account of factual reference is intimately\nlinked with the concept of truth. In general, the meaning of a sentence\nconsists, according to the theory proposed by Feigl, in its truth\nconditions (see Feigl 1950b, p. 191 and Feigl 1981, p. 43). These truth\nconditions, in turn, are treated compositionally: they obtain when the\nentities to which we refer stand in the relations to which we refer,\nthat is, independently of the conditions of the corresponding scenario\nof verification. Accordingly, relations between the ‘factual\nreferents’ of theoretical terms serve as ‘truth\nmakers’ for theoretical statements. Feigl therefore concludes\nthat by adopting a “semantic metalanguage” (as he could\nfind it in the works of Tarski and the later Carnap) we are in a\nposition to employ “a conceptual model in which statements as\nwell as the states of affairs that render these statements true, can be\nrepresented” (Feigl 1950a, p. 49). \n  \n\nStill, there is an important qualification in Feigl’s account\nof realism. This qualification has to do with the fact that Feigl takes\npains to separate his own semantic-scientific realism from traditional\nmetaphysical realism. By metaphysical realism, Feigl means all attempts\nto systematically employ “transcendent, i.e., in principle\nuntestable, assertions” (Feigl 1956, p. 22). By his own account,\nhowever, the testability or confirmability of an assertion is the\ncrucial criterion for its being meaningful. Feigl\nwrites:  \n\nAnd at another place, he comments: \n\nIt should be noted that this passage is quoted from Feigl’s\nreply to criticisms brought forward by his logical empiricist\ncolleagues Philipp Frank, Carl Gustav Hempel, and Ernest Nagel (the\ncontext being a symposium on Feigl’s “Existential\nHypotheses”). Hempel, for instance, had argued that the notion of\nthe reference of theoretical terms is “unnecessary” because\nit “can be eliminated, by means of Feigl’s own criterion of\nfactual reference” (Hempel 1950b, p. 173), namely the systematic\ninterconnections between theoretical statements on the one hand and\nobservations sentences on the other. In a similar vein, Frank had\nobjected that “after the introduction of the truth conditions a\nstatement in the language of ‘semantical realism’ can no\nlonger be distinguished from a statement in the language of\n‘syntactical positivism’” (Frank 1950, p. 167). Quite\nthe same was brought forward by Nagel who argued that by heavily\nrelying on confirmability Feigl completely remains within the\n‘received’ logical positivist agenda, so that his talk of\n‘realism’ should be regarded as devoid of any distinctive\ncharacter. According to Nagel, “Feigl is pressing for a\ndistinction without a difference” (Nagel 1950, p. 179). \n\nIn order to counter these objections one would have to show how\nsemantics (i.e., Feigl’s theory of reference and truth) and\nepistemology (i.e., Feigl’s insistence on confirmability) are\nrelated to each other. There is some evidence that Feigl’s\nadoption of Wilfrid Sellars’s idea of a ‘pure\npragmatics’ (see Feigl 1950a, pp. 49–50; 1981, pp. 254–255) could\nplay the essential role in this connection. However, Sellars’s\nconception of a ‘pure pragmatics’ is itself rather\n“eccentric” (Carus 2004, p. 320) and it is fairly hard to\nsee how, according to Feigl, a realist approach to science could be\ndefended on the basis of an essentially pragmatic justification (for\nfurther details, see Neuber 2011, pp. 175–176, and especially Neuber 2017) \n\nFeigl’s treatment of the mind-body problem is his probably\nbest well-known—and at the same time most\ncontroversial—contribution to philosophy. It is often lumped\ntogether with the views of U.T. Place, J.J.C. Smart, D.M. Armstrong,\nand other Australian, ‘materialist,’ philosophers (see, for\nexample Kim 1998, pp. 1–2). Indeed, both Feigl’s and the\nAustralians’ approach toward the mind-body problem share a number\nof similarities. On the whole, they are both versions of a\nnon-dualistic (anti-Cartesian), physicalistically inspired\n‘identity theory.’ However, there are significant\ndifferences between the Austrian (i.e. Feigl’s) and the\nAustralian version or the identity theory (see Stubenberg 1997).\nWhereas the Australians take the physical as unproblematic and attempt\nto reduce the mental to the physical, Feigl takes the mental as\nunproblematic and attempts to integrate it into a sophisticated\nphysicalistic conception of the world. \n\nIt is important to note that Feigl’s version of the identity\ntheory is not without precursors. It has even been argued that\n“[s]een against the backdrop of nineteenth-century German and\nAustrian philosophy, Feigl’s approach was neither novel nor\naudacious; he merely revived a tradition that had once been a\nmainstream topic turned unfashionable; to be exact, he modified and\nspelled out one specific traditional position” (Heidelberger\n2003, p. 234). This might be exaggerated, but it can hardly be\ncontested that Feigl, in his treatment of the mind-body problem, was\n(again) committed to the critical realist accounts of Alois Riehl (cf.\nRiehl 1879, 1881, 1887; further Röd 2001) and especially of the\nearly (pre-Viennese) Schlick (see the entry on \n Moritz Schlick). As Feigl himself\nfrequently pointed out, it was the early Schlick’s\n“double-knowledge” or “double-language” theory\nthat exerted the greatest influence upon his own approach (see, for\nexample, Feigl 1981, p. 288). In a nutshell, Schlick, in his\nGeneral Theory of Knowledge (1918; 1925), had argued that the\ndifference of the mental and the physical is a difference between two\nconceptual systems and not a difference between two areas of reality.\nIt was, in other words, an epistemological rather than a metaphysical\nproblem (cf. Schlick 1974, p. 300). According to Schlick, the\n“relation between immediately experienced reality and the\nphysical brain processes is […] no longer one of causal\ndependency but of simple identity. What we have is one and the\nsame reality, not ‘viewed from two different sides’ or\n‘manifesting itself in two different forms’, but designated\nby two different conceptual systems, the psychological and the\nphysical” (ibid., p. 299). It was this very line of thought that\nconfirmed Feigl in his conviction that “the mind-body problem is\nnot a pseudoproblem” (Feigl 1981, p. 349). \n\nThe essential question to be answered by an elaborated identity\ntheory is, in Feigl’s view, the following: “[H]ow are the\nraw feels related to behavioral (or neurophysiological) states?”\n(1967, p. 5) By posing the question that way, Feigl excludes a\nreductive solution to the mind-body problem. More precisely, he\ndissociates himself from the “reductive fallacies” (1981,\np. 16) of eliminative materialism and of radical behaviorism. On the\nother hand, however, Feigl is eager to demarcate his own position from\novertly—metaphysically inspired—dualistic conceptions, such\nas parallelism or epiphenomenalism. He explicitly opts for a\n“monistic solution” (ibid., p. 298), arguing that the\ndualistic position would lead to an ungrounded “duplication of\nrealities” (1967, p. 94), whereas the—scientifically\nwell-established—principle of parsimony “does oppose the\noperationistic predilection for speaking of two (or more) concepts if\nthe evidential facts, though completely correlated, are qualitatively\nheterogeneous” (ibid.) \n\nOn the constructive side, Feigl’s solution to the mind-body\nproblem might indeed be regarded as a direct continuation of the\nearlier ‘double-language’ conception presented by Schlick.\nLike in the case of the realism issue, Feigl attempts at a semantically\nmore sophisticated revision of the original Schlickian point of view.\nOne can even go further and say that it is the very same terminology\nwhich is employed by Feigl in this connection. Thus, just like in the\ncase of realism, Feigl categorically distinguishes the evidential (or\nconfirmatory) basis from the factual reference (or content) of the\nrespective knowledge claims. Feigl writes: \n\nAccordingly, it is mental states which are to be regarded as the\nreferents of both psychological and physical terms. More precisely,\nFeigl assumes that, in the case of psychological terms, evidence is\nderived from (direct) knowledge by acquaintance, whereas in the case of\nphysical (neurophysiological) terms evidence is derived from (indirect)\nknowledge by description (see Feigl 1967, p. 94). Yet, the referent is\nin both cases the same, so that we have a relation of\n‘referential identity,’ as in the context of Gottlob\nFrege’s example of the terms ‘morning star’ and\n‘evening star’ that differ in sense (Sinn), but\nnot in reference (Bedeutung), which in both cases is\nidentical, namely Venus (see, for this analogy, Feigl 1981, pp.\n346–347). Consequently, we have two kinds of evidence for one and the\nsame type of events. It is for this reason that Feigl’s identity\ntheory is committed to a dualism at the evidential basis. Or, as Feigl\nputs it in “The ‘Mental’ and the\n‘Physical’”: \n\nIn the footnote attached to this passage, Feigl refers the reader to\nthe views of Riehl, Schlick, Russell, and Roy Wood Sellars (among\nothers); and he then continues: \n\nThere are two peculiarities to be noticed in Feigl’s version\nof the double-language theory. First, it must be seen that qualia (raw\nfeels) are, for Feigl, the—epistemologically—basic\nreality. On his conception, we have privileged access to this\nbasic reality, so that (as Feigl points out in the postscript to\n“The ‘Mental’ and the ‘Physical’”)\nthe “egocentric account” (ibid., p. 155) must be regarded\nas the most immediate mode of getting into contact with reality,\nwhereas “all scientific accounts […] deal with Being only\nindirectly and structurally” (ibid.; see also Feigl 1981, pp. 17\nand 351). The privileged access to qualia (such as seeing red, feeling\npain, etc.) is, according to Feigl, accompanied by the use of indexical\nterms (such as “here”, “now”, “I”,\netc.) that in turn form part of a “private” (egocentric)\nlanguage and which are systematically analyzed in the context of the\nmetalinguistic discipline of pure pragmatics (see Feigl 1967, p. 147).\nThus, in Feigl’s view, “I must be able to know (by\n‘acquaintance’) some phenomenal qualities and relations\n(redness, between-ness, etc.) in order to ‘hook’ (i.e.\nconnect) my private language to the intersubjective language of\nscience” (ibid.). At the same time, he sees no problem in\ndescribing private mental states by intersubjective scientific\n(neurophysiological) terms. “Privacy,” Feigl writes,\n“is capable of public (intersubjective) description, and the\nobjects of intersubjective science can be evidenced by data of private\nexperience” (ibid., p. 81). After all, Feigl is convinced of the\n“indispensability of a subjectivistically understood conception\nof immediate (first person) experience” (Feigl 1981, p. 353),\nwhich, on the one hand, entails a clear rejection of Ludwig\nWittgenstein’s arguments against the possibility of a private\nlanguage (see Feigl 1981, p. 355), and, on the other hand, marks a\nsignificant contrast to the Australians’ strategy of\n‘explaining away’ the phenomenal properties of mental\nstates (see, in this connection, Stubenberg 1997, pp. 135–136). The\npossible objection that Feigl, by epistemologically privileging qualia,\nruns into the trap of panpsychism can be countered by the argument that\nall reality is, in fact, “at bottom qualitative”\n(Stubenberg 1997, p. 143). Thus, not only mental states, but also the\ndiverse physical magnitudes (like mass, pressure, gravitational field\nintensity, etc.) are distinguishable only by their qualitative\npeculiarities (see Feigl 1967, pp. 43–44; see further Schlick 1974, pp.\n283–285). But this does not imply that all reality is, like panpsychism\nwould have it, intrinsically psychic. Qualia form part of reality, but\nreality comprises more than only qualia. The point is that qualia (raw\nfeels) are, for Feigl, epistemologically privileged as compared to\nordinary objects and the entities posited by science. “Reference\nto one’s own immediate experience,” Feigl (in an overtly\nSchlickian manner) writes, “is the (epistemological) prototype of\nall designations of objects, properties or relations by the words of\nour language” (1981, p. 355).  \n\n The second point to be noticed is that, according to\nFeigl’s version of the identity theory, the mode of\nascertainment of the identity of the mental (raw feels) and\nthe physical (neural processes) is empirical in character. Had Feigl in\nhis first publication on the mind-body problem in 1934 assumed that the\nrelationship between the mental and the physical is that of a\nlogical identity (thereby implying that the language of\npsychology can be fully translated into the language of physics,\nviz. neurophysiology), he, in his later writings, no longer\nconceived of that identity as a logically necessary, but as an\nempirical (contingent) kind of identity. This meant, in the first\nplace, that the corroboration of the philosophically outlined\nmonism had to be provided, not by philosophical analysis again, but by\nthe factual sciences themselves. “On the whole,” Feigl\nconcluded: \n\nThe sort of modesty displayed in passages like the above is very\ncharacteristic of Feigl’s way of thinking. Just as in his\ndiscussion of the realism issue, he leaves it to the factual sciences\nto judge about the adequacy of his preferred philosophical position.\nHis methodological outlook can therefore be characterized as\n“metascientific” (rather than metaphysical), in the sense\nthat “a comprehensive reflection on the results of\nscience as well as on the logic and epistemology of scientific\nmethod” (ibid., p. 349) is aspired to. However, the\ndecision between global philosophical stances, like realism and\nphenomenalism or, as concerns the mind-body problem, monism and dualism\ncannot be decided by empirical means, but only by a “pragmatic\njustification” (ibid., p. 294). In the case of the identity\ntheory, this pragmatic justification is, as has been pointed out\nbefore, guided by the principle of parsimony. \n\nFeigl’s approach to the mind-body problem became subject of\nextended controversy. While some authors directly contested the\nidentity thesis as such (see, for example, Abelson 1970 and Epstein\n1973; further the replies in Grünbaum 1972 and Nathanson 1972),\nothers urged that Feigl should clarify his conception of the relation\nof phenomenal predicates and “raw feels.” Especially\nFeigl’s Minnesota collaborator Paul Meehl argued along these\nlines, claiming that the main problem with Feigl’s view stems\nfrom semantics (see Meehl 1966; further Aune 1966). On the whole,\nit can be said that identity theory was discussed from various\nphilosophical perspectives. That Feigl left a considerable legacy can\nhardly be denied in this connection.  \n\nFeigl’s writings on practical issues like ethics, humanism,\nand religion are rather less well known (but see, rather recently, the reconstruction in Siegetsleitner 2014, ch. 11). Still, they are worth\nconsidering, especially since they contain some interesting\napplications and extensions of the logical empiricist agenda. The\nall-embracing idea, though, came from the eighteenth century: According\nto Feigl, “a new age of enlightenment, scientific as well as\nethical, is our most imperative need” (1981, p. 406). Therefore,\n“[t]he straightforward spirit of eighteenth-century Enlightenment\n(e.g. Hume, Kant) needs reviving and ‘updating’”\n(1981, p. 399). The programmatic frame for this ‘updating’\nFeigl labeled “scientific humanism” (ibid., pp. 368, 405,\n408, 418)—by which he understood the attempt at a\n“synthesis of the scientific attitude with an active interest in\nthe whole scale of human values” (ibid., p. 368). It was this\nconception within which he theorized about the relationships between\nethics and logic and between religion and empirical science.\n  \n\nAs concerns the relationship between ethics and logic, Feigl draws a\nprincipled distinction between two kinds of justification:\n“vindication” and “validation” (see Feigl 1981,\npp. 14, 256–260, 385). While validation “involves reliance upon\nthe principles of logic” (ibid., p. 245), vindication has to do\nwith the pragmatics of evaluating certain types of behavior with\nrespect to certain ends. Thus the latter, pragmatic, form of\njustification may be called ‘justificatio\nactionis,’ whereas the former, logical, form of\njustification may be called ‘justificatio\ncognitionis’ (see ibid., p. 385). Feigl’s point, then,\nis to show that specific ethical norms are capable of being validated,\nbut that general ethical principles (and the respective ethical\nsystems) are only capable of being vindicated. Feigl writes: \n\nTwo things should be noted here. First, in contrast to other logical\nempiricist accounts of ethics (for example, in the fist place, A.J.\nAyer’s), Feigl’s conception is, as has been argued (see\nKellerwessel 2010), committed to a certain form of\ncognitivism. That means that “moral judgments are to be\nreconstructed as knowledge-claims and as subject to validation (or\ninvalidation) by virtue of their accordance (or non-accordance) with\nthe supreme norms of a given ethical system” (Feigl 1981, p.\n388). Accordingly, within such a given ethical system, moral\nreasoning can be justified by the “rules of deductive and\ninductive inference” (ibid., p. 385) and thus be reconstructed\nalong cognitive, i.e. rational, lines. However, secondly, the\nrespective ethical system (and its “supreme norms”) itself\ncan only be vindicated by pragmatic maxims. Thus, Feigl allows\nthe possibility of a “pragmatic justification of the adoption of\nan alternative frame” (ibid., p. 386), thereby implying that\nthere exists a plurality of alternative ethical systems. It is\ninteresting to see that Feigl refers the reader here to Carnap’s\ndistinction between “internal” and “external”\nquestions in his 1950 “Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology”\n(see Feigl 1981, p. 391, Fn. 3; see further Feigl 1981, pp. 13–14).\nIndeed, there is a deep analogy between this distinction drawn by\nCarnap and Feigl’s distinction between the validation\nwithin an ethical system and the vindication of the\nethical system (and its supreme norms) itself. Furthermore, it can be\nstated that Feigl, in his pragmatic argument for scientific\nrealism, was also inspired by Carnap’s distinction and\nits relativization of the ontological dimension (see, for further\ndetails, Neuber 2011, p. 179). \n\nOn the whole, scientific humanism is designed to avoid the extremes.\nIt qualifies, according to Feigl, as “a tenable middle ground\nbetween the relativists and the absolutists in morals” (1981, p.\n417). In contrast to relativism, it is assumed that certain basic human\nvalues, such as justice, fairness or equality, are universally\napplicable. However, in contrast to (for instance, Kantian) absolutism,\nit is at the same time assumed that those values are related to human\ninterests and thus empirically variable. They “may have come out\nof the natural development of human beings in the social context”\n(ibid., p. 420), and they can only be justified pragmatically (by way\nof vindication). But, Feigl maintains, that does not make them\narbitrary: “If we dig deeper into human nature we find that in\nsome social contexts certain moral ideals inevitably work themselves\nout” (ibid., p. 418). In the “age of scientific\nenlightenment” (ibid., p. 420) an ethically disinterested or even\ncynical view of the world is therefore out of place: “Psychology\npoints in the direction of human needs and interests that must be\nsatisfied. And in the social context, certain traffic rules simply have\nto be obeyed if we are to survive as a society. Thus we have ideals of\njustice and equality.” (ibid.)  \n\nFeigl’s broadly naturalistic view of human beings and the\nworld, together with the (liberalized) logical empiricist criterion of\nmeaning, entails a constructive but at the same time critical approach\ntoward religion. To be sure, Feigl did not deny the existence of\nreligious experiences (see, for example, Feigl 1981, 399–400). But he\ndid not “see […] the slightest reason for accepting\nany sort of theology” (ibid., p. 399). Although some of\nthe dogmas of theology were seen by Feigl as “perfectly\nmeaningful” (ibid., p. 13), he conceived of them as being false\n(or as being extremely unlikely). The option of a\n“demythologized” (or modernized) theology is, Feigl further\nmaintained, “no longer a theology at all; it reduces to a moral\nmessage, formulated by the use of allegorical, but essentially\nexhorting, consoling, edifying, or fortifying language” (ibid.,\np. 406). By accepting scientific humanism, on the other hand, we are,\naccording to Feigl, in a position to “adopt an ethics without\nsupernatural foundation or supernatural sanctions” (ibid., p.\n405). Religious experiences, in turn, are then explainable in purely\nnaturalistic terms. They do not serve as the basis of scientific or\neveryday explanation of human behavior. Rather, they are themselves\nsubject of scientific explanation. Or, in Feigl’s own\nwords: \n\nFeigl’s role in the development of twentieth-century\nanalytical philosophy is not to be underrated. His 1950 article on\n“Existential Hypotheses” can, as has been argued (cf.\nNeuber 2011), be regarded as a ground-breaking contribution to the\ndebate over scientific realism within the analytical tradition. In\nparticular his focusing on the semantic notions of reference and truth\nturned out as instructive for the following development, as it is\nrepresented in the (programmatically diverse) writings of Richard\nBoyd, Larry Laudan, and specifically Hilary Putnam. In recent times,\nthe attempt has been made to revive Feigl’s point of view by\nsystematically exploiting the idea of “choosing the realist\nframework” (see Psillos 2011). Similarly, Feigl’s analysis\nof the mind-body problem exerted remarkable influence on the\nphilosophical discourse of the second half of the twentieth century.\nThus, according to Jaegwon Kim, “it was the papers by Smart and\nFeigl that introduced the mind-body problem as mainstream metaphysical\nProblematik of analytical philosophy, and launched the debate that has\ncontinued to this day” (Kim 1998, p. 1). To be sure, alternative\napproaches, such as Putnam’s ‘functionalism’ or\nDonald Davidson’s ‘anomalous monism’ came up quite\nearly in the discussion. Nevertheless, Feigl’s (and\nSmart’s) account “helped set basic parameters and\nconstraints for the debates that were to come—a set of broadly\nphysicalist assumptions and aspirations that still guide and constrain\nour thinking today” (ibid., p. 2)  \n\n Besides these contributions to the theoretical discourse,\nFeigl played an important role at the institutional level. He not only\nfounded and headed the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science, but\nhe also, in 1949, founded and co-edited the (still existing) journal\nPhilosophical Studies and, in 1956, the series Minnesota\nStudies in the Philosophy of Science. Moreover, he edited such\nstandard setting volumes as Readings in Philosophical Analysis\n(1949, together with Wilfrid Sellars) and Readings in the\nPhilosophy of Science (1953, together with May Brodbeck).\nFurthermore, it should be emphasized that Feigl, together with Paul\nMeehl, energetically promoted the revalorization of psychology\nas a serious academic discipline. The Minnesota Center was an extremely\ninfluential forum in this connection (for further details, see Smith\n1986). \n\nBeing a scientific philosopher par excellence, Feigl once\ndeclared: \nThis diagnosis, though provocative, is still accurate today.","contact.mail":"matthias.neuber@uni-tuebingen.de","contact.domain":"uni-tuebingen.de"}]
