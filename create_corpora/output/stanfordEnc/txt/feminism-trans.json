The goal in this entry is to outline some of\nthe key philosophical issues at the intersections, and this can be\naccomplished only by attending to the history of feminist and trans\npolitics as it has unfolded in the U.S. “Transgender” as a\npolitics and “trans studies” as a twin of “queer\nstudies” (Stryker 2004) emerged in the early 1990s and this\nemergence is intertwined with feminist as well as queer theory and\npolitics. (These terms will be explained below.) Consequently, this\nentry will follow a roughly chronological order.\n\n\n\nOne major set of philosophical themes concerns competing conceptions\nof the self and its relation to the sexed body and to gender.\n(Biological sex is often distinguished from gender,\ntaken as the cultural roles assigned on the basis of sex). Is the self\nprior to the institution of gender identity? Is sex the\n“hardware” on which the program of gender is run, or is sex\nitself thoroughly cultural? If the self is irrevocably immersed in\ncultural gender, how is resistance to gender oppression possible at\nall? Moreover, how should answers to these questions inform feminist\npolitics and theory? How should they inform trans politics and\ntheory?\n\n\n\nA related set of themes concerns the political and philosophical\ndifficulties in formulating a theory of gender oppression and\nstrategies for resistance when multiple modalities of oppression are\nrecognized: If trans people are oppressed as trans people and\nwomen are oppressed as women, then it would seem we need an\naccount of at least two different modalities of gender oppression. Do\nthese two different modalities lead to politics that are inevitably at\nodds with each other? And if so how could we then accommodate\nindividuals who are oppressed as woman and as trans people? How\nis coalition among non trans feminists and trans activists possible?\nWhere are the grounds of commonality? Where are the tensions?\n\n\n\nTransgender is often used to refer to people who “do\nnot conform to prevailing expectations about gender” by\npresenting and living genders that were not assigned to them at birth\nor by presenting and living genders in ways that may not be readily\nintelligible in terms of more traditional conceptions of gender. Used\nas an umbrella term, it generally aims to group several different kinds\nof people such as transsexuals, drag queens and kings, some butch\nlesbians, and (heterosexual) male cross dressers. Earlier the term\ntransgenderist had been used by Virginia Prince, a pioneer in\nthe cross dresser movement in the US, to stand for a person who lives\nin the gender “opposite” the one assigned to them at birth\nbut who is not a transsexual (Stryker 2008, 123). It seems that Leslie\nFeinberg was one of the first to use this as a political, umbrella term\n(ibid). \n\nThe term currently flags the political stance, especially\nin the Anglo United States, of resisting medical pathologization of\ntrans people. This places it in prima facie opposition to the\nolder notion of transsexual (at least in the more traditional\nsense of that word). The term transgender is also sometimes\nused as an equivalent to transgenderist, to refer to folk who\nlive full-time in the role other than the one assigned to them at birth\nbut who do not see themselves as transsexual. \n\nTranssexual is often used to refer to individuals who use\nhormonal and/or surgical technologies to alter their bodies to conform\nto their gendered sense of self in ways that may be construed as at\nodds with the sex assigned at birth or in ways that may not be readily\nintelligible in terms of traditional conceptions of sexed bodies. It\nmay also be used to indicate people who self-identify and live as the\nsex “opposite” to the one assigned to them at birth. The\ncondition of being a transsexual has been captured by the terms\ntranssexualism and transsexuality, the latter of\nwhich will be used in this entry. \n\nTraditionally, the term transsexual has been connected to\npsychiatric notions such as gender dysphoria and has also been associated\nwith the metaphor “trapped in the wrong body.” The term was\nfirst used in English by David Caldwell (spelled with one s). It was then\npopularized by Harry Benjamin (spelled with two). Transsexual\nhas now also been redeployed in ways amenable to and possibly\nsubsumable under the more recent term transgender (depending,\nin part, upon one's political stance). It may also be\nused as a political term indicating a break from the term\ntransgender and as possibly contesting the underlying\npolitical ideology of “the transgender movement.” \n\nFTM and MTF are abbreviations of\nfemale-to-male and male-to-female. They were\noriginally connected to transsexual (medical) discourse indicating\nindividuals who transition to the “opposite” sex. They are\nnow used in ways that have broken from this medical discourse and may\nbe used more generally to indicate folk who move away from being\nassigned male (or female) at birth to the “other”\ndirection. They may also be used as primitive (undefined) terms. This\nmeans that they are not treated as abbreviations indicating transition\nfrom one sex to another. Instead, they are used to simply categorize\nindividuals in a way analogous to the categories man and\nwoman. \n\nQueer is a political and theoretical term and a reclamation\nof the word used as an insult. Politically it was associated with\ngroups such as Queer Nation and is used as umbrella term to apply to\nindividuals often associated with the categories lesbian, gay,\nbisexual, and transgender (LGBT). It generally indicates opposition to\nidentity-based categories and signals a strong antipathy for\n“heteronormativity” (roughly: the taken-for-granted social\nand sexual arrangements in a heterosexual-centered world-view).\nQueer Theory roughly applies to theoretical work, typically\ninformed by Foucault and Derrida, that aims to study and\n“deconstruct” heteronormative ideology. It emerged in the\n1990s through thinkers such as Judith Butler and Eve Kosofsky\nSedgwick. The term genderqueer draws on the political force\nof queer. It is used as a term of self-identification by\nindividuals who do not subscribe to the traditional binary division\nbetween male/female, man/woman, and masculine/feminine. An individual\nwho self-identifies may claim both sexes or genders, neither, or a\ncomplex blend of them.\n \n\nSince around 2010, the term trans* has been used in place\nof transgender and trans in order to provide for\nmore possibilities. One of the reasons for this is that many of the\npeople who self-identify as trans (or as transgender) identify as men\nor women and therefore in one way place themselves within traditional\nbinary categories. As a consequence, those who do not place themselves\nwithin the binary (e.g., genderqueer people) are effectively left out,\ndespite the original intention behind transgender as an inclusive\numbrella term. Since its introduction, unfortunately the term is also\nnow frequently used as a prefix that occurs before woman or man (as in\ntrans* man and trans* woman) in well-intentioned efforts at\ninclusivity. A problem, however, is that such a use may replicate the\nvery problem that led to the introduction of trans* in the first place\nby generating the expectation that trans* people are either trans* men\nor trans* women and thereby eliding trans* identities that resist\nplacement within a gender binary. Moreover, many trans people may not\nself-identify as trans* and so there is a problem of wrongfully\nimputing identities (and political agendas) that run contrary to\nself-identifications. \n\nIn this entry, trans will be used as a place-holder for the\npossibly productive political tensions discussed above (transsexual\nvs. transgender, trans* vs. transgender). Since many forms of\ntransphobia involve categorizing individuals contrary to their own\nsense of self, caution is required in applying terms to individuals\nwho may not self-identify with them. In light of this, the use\nof trans should not be understood to impute an identity or a\nshared political vision. Rather, it is a functional term restricted to\nthis entry alone, and is not intended to invoke a shared category\namong diverse individuals The expressions trans women\nand trans men will be used to refer to MTFs and FTMs who\nself-identify as women and men respectively (where trans\nfunctions as a context-restricted placeholder for the aforementioned\npolitical tensions. \n\nUntil 2013, Gender Identity Disorder had been a diagnostic\ncategory in both the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV-TR\n(Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and the World\nHealth Organization's ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases\nand Related Health Problems). The newer DSM-V replaces the diagnostic\ncategory Gender Identity Disorder with Gender Dysphoria in an effort\nto lessen stigmatization. Nonetheless, trans experiences continue to\nbe captured by diagnostic categories in manuals which provide criteria\nfor mental disorders. \n\nWhile homosexuality was removed from the DSM as a diagnostic\ncategory in 1973, transsexuality was added in the 1980 DSM-III.\nHowever, the view of transsexuality and other trans-related phenomena\nas psychiatric and/or medical conditions has a much longer history. To\nbe sure, not all accounts of trans phenomena were pathologizing\n(indeed, some aimed at political liberation). However, it is clear that\nearly scholarly discussion of trans phenomena unfolded within the field\nof sexology—the “scientific” study of human\nsexuality. Some of the most notable thinkers include Karl Heinrich\nUlrichs, Richard von Krafft-Ebing ([1886] 1965), Havelock Ellis ([1905]\n1942), and Magnus Hirshfeld ([1910] 1991). \n\nIn the early first part of the twentieth century, European\nscientists began to experiment with “sex-change”\n(Meyerowitz 2002, 16–21). By 1953, media sensation Christine Jorgensen\nhad become the first “celebrity” MTF transsexual in the\nUnited States and scientific controversy heated over whether\ntranssexuality was a psychological or physical condition (Meyerowitz\n2002). While the former position (then dominant in the U.S.) held that\ntrans phenomena were purely psychological in nature and ought to be\ntreated psychotherapeutically to “cure the mental illness”,\nthe latter (European model) held a “bisexuality theory”\nwhich maintained that there was a physical blend of male and female in\nall human beings and that special cases yielded a\n“mixed-sex” condition which in some cases justified\nsurgical intervention (Meyerowitz 2002, 98–129) \n\nWork by John Money, Joan Hampson, and John Hampson on intersexuality\n(the state of having both female and male biological characteristics)\nled to the introduction of the technical term gender\n(1955). They purported to evade the debate between psychology\nand biology, arguing that while the capacity to learn a gender role\nand orientation (like a language) was biologically grounded, the\nspecific native role and orientation learned (like language) was\ncontingent upon social environment which became “locked\ndown” at a very early age (1957). Subsequently, the expression\ngender identity was coined by Robert Stoller and Ralph\nGreenson in 1964, which helped terminologically separate the notion of\nsocial role from psychological sense-of-self. It was ultimately taken\nup by the likes of Money and Harry Benjamin (Meyerowitz 2002,\n117–9), and while debate over etiology continued, views allowing\nfor both biology and social environment in determining gender identity\ngained somewhat greater prominence (Meyerowitz 2002, 119). Notably, in\nthese views, gender identity is a biological demand to the extent that\nthe capacity for gender identity (as the capacity for language) is\nviewed as innate. Such a view would seem to suggest that gender, like\nlanguage, is integral to the human self. \n\nIn 1966, Benjamin published the landmark The Transsexual\nPhenomenon and that same year saw the opening of the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity program for sex-reassignment surgery, ushering in a period\nof large university-based gender-identity clinics which lasted until\nthe end of the seventies. By the closing of Johns Hopkins in 1979, the\nHarry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (since\nrenamed The World Health Professional Association for Transgender\nHealth or WPATH) had been formed and had approved standardized criteria\nfor the treatment of transsexuals. A year later,\ntranssexualism was added to the DSM. \n\nNotably, until the early nineties, the vehicle by which transsexuals\nwrote about their own experiences was largely autobiography. Some\nexamples of these include Canary Conn's The Story of a\nTranssexual (1977), Mario Mario's Emergence: A\nTranssexual Autobiography (1977), and Jan Morris'\nConundrum: An Extraordinary Narrative of Transsexualism\n(1986) \n\nMany of the earliest non-trans feminist perspectives on transsexuals\nwere marked by hostility. One of the first examples of non-trans\nfeminist reactions to trans women was the expulsion of Beth Elliott\nfrom the Daughters of Bilitis and the subsequent controversy over her\nparticipation in 1973 in the West Coast Lesbian Conference in Los\nAngeles (Stryker 2008). At the conference, Robin Morgan charged\nElliot, “as an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a\ndestroyer—with the mentality of a rapist” (Morgan 1978,\n181). This theme of “violation” can also be found in Mary\nDaly's\nGyn/Ecology (1978, 71). It is more thoroughly elaborated in\nJanice Raymond's The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the\nShe-Male (1979) where she writes : \n\nThe thesis that MTF transsexuals are rapists because they\nappropriate women's bodies to themselves or through deception is\ndifficult to assess since no arguments seem to have been given in its\ndefense. However it will be worth trying to push such extreme\nrepresentations to the side in order to isolate the core assumptions\nwhich ground Raymond's position as well as to appreciate her\nfeminist critique of transsexuality as a medical phenomenon. \nRaymond's position is underwritten by a substrate view about sex\naccording to which sex exists as a given prior to the machinations of\nculture; social sex roles are then assigned on the basis of sex.\n(Raymond does not usually use the term gender,\npreferring, instead, the expression sex role). Membership\nin the category woman is determined by chromosomes and the\nindividual's history of experience being assigned to a sex role\n(1979, 4, 18, 114). In light of this, Raymond maintains that MTF\ntranssexuals are really men and FTM transsexuals are really women. The\nlast condition (history of experience) is important in noting that MTF\ntranssexuals have avoided the history of damage done to women who have\nsuffered a lifetime under sex-role oppression. It is worth\nrecognizing, however, that while MTFs may have avoided this oppression\nbefore transitioning, many MTFs experience sexual harassment and\ndiscrimination in the workplace, the threat of all variations of rape,\nsurvival sex work, and domestic violence after transitioning.\nMoreover, some MTFs live as women from a very young age. \nA second underlying assumption of Raymond’s position is that\noppression experienced by transsexuals (and trans people more\ngenerally) is nothing but an aspect of the sexist oppression enforced\nthrough sex role (1979, xviii, 16). In other words, MTFs are really men\nwho are victims of the violence done through the rigidly enforced\nsex-role system and FTMs are really women who, as such, are the central\ntargets of this system. Gender dysphoria experienced by transsexuals,\nin such a view, is to be understood as unhappiness with the existing\nsex-role system. This means that Raymond does not recognize a distinct\nmodality of oppression that specifically targets trans people in a way\nthat is non-reducible to the sexist oppression inherent in sex roles.\nRaymond poses the rhetorical question “Does a Black person who\nwants to be white suffer from the ‘disease’ of being a\n‘transracial?’” and then observes that “there is no\ndemand for transracial medical intervention precisely because most\nBlacks recognize that it is their society, not their skin, that needs\nchanging” [Raymond 1994, xvi]. What is lacking in such an account\nis the possibility that transsexuals might be oppressed as\ntranssexuals. \nOn the basis of these two theses, Raymond is led to see the\nmedicalization of gender variance and the gender identity clinics as\nnothing but vehicles to further secure sexist sex roles. Thus, for\nher, a sexist society is “the first cause” of\ntranssexuality (1979, 16). The role of the medical treatment of\ntranssexuality is to turn men into “women” and women into\n“men” when they cannot be normed into their natally\nassigned sex roles. For Raymond, the phrase transsexual\nempire applies to the patriarchal medical establishment which\nperpetuates sex-role oppression through surgical intervention. (She\nuses the word empire to refer to “a political unit having\na territory of great extent, or a number of territories under a single\nsovereign authority” (xv). She sees the medical\n“empire” as including numerous specialties such as\nurology, gynecology, endocrinology, and so forth.  She also sees the\ncollaboration of psychology and psychiatry in hiding what she calls\nthe sovereignty of the medical “empire” by making it\nappear that there is some need for transsexual medical intervention,\nas well as the involvement of lawyers and legislators.  However, it is\nthe medical establishment, for Raymond, which possesses this\nsovereignty. So it is the medical establishment which is the unifying\nauthority of the “transsexual empire” (ibid.)). \n\nNow Raymond is right that the medicalization of transsexuality\ninvolved the perpetuation of sexist (and heterosexist) norms. Yet the\nactual struggle of some scientists and surgeons to make surgeries\navailable to transsexuals is ignored in Raymond's account (Riddell\n2006). Such advocates for transsexual surgery were in the minority\n(certainly in the U.S) and themselves experienced hostility and\nmarginalization. This means that what Raymond calls the transsexual\nempire was not monolithic. And given the marginalization of\nthese advocates for transsexual surgery, it seems that the medical\nestablishment was not especially friendly to transsexuality (Riddell\n2006). Generally transsexuality was and remains largely unaccepted in\nsociety. Contrary to Raymond's view, it is largely not\nendorsed by “the patriarchy.” \n\nRaymond's contrast between integration and\nintegrity brings out a core aspect of her picture of\nliberation. Integration, for Raymond, involves putting\ntogether parts to form a complex whole (1979, 163). She sees androgyny\nas a kind of blend between masculine and feminine and she argues that\ntranssexual surgery also brings about such blends (constructing the\nindividual into a kind of hermaphroditic being) (1979, 165). By\ncontrast, integrity involves a prior wholeness from which no\npart can be taken away (193). For Raymond, true liberation cannot be\nsecured by any mere blending of sex roles. Rather, it must be secured\nthrough a transcendence of sex role altogether (164). This\nsuggests a notion of the self that is prior to sex role or at least a\nnotion of a self that can be freed from the cultural interpretations of\nsex. Raymond's solution to “the problem” of\ntranssexuality which she sees as promoting the surgical violation of\nbodily integrity, is to “morally mandate it out of\nexistence” (178) by working against sex role oppression through\neducation and consciousness raising (178–185). \nRaymond's representation of transsexuals themselves warrants\nparticular comment. Beyond the two key assumptions mentioned above,\nRaymond adopts a stance for which transsexual subjectivities are\nerased. This means that she constructs monolithic, stereotypical\nrepresentations of trans individuals (based on her own ideology) in\nways that foreclose the possibility of registering the actual variable\nexperiences of trans people (on this point see Riddell 2006, 152–3,\nStone 1991, 298, Heyes 2003, 1095). She points to ways in which (some)\nMTFs take up traditional sex roles (and are thereby complicit) on the\none hand (77–79), and yet goes on to criticize lesbian-separatist\nidentified MTFs who have eschewed such roles as oppressively masculine\n(102–6). In this way, she traps MTF transsexuals with a double-bind:\nEither MTFs take up traditional sex roles and are thereby sexist or\nelse they eschew these traditional sex roles and are thereby sexist\n(See Califia 1997, 102, 104–5; Serano 2007, 49). Such a theory\nisn't equipped to accommodate the actual variable experiences of\nMTFs trying to negotiate gender in a sexist and transphobic world. In this way,\nRaymond's theory erases the actual experiences of MTFs through\nmonolithic, ideologically-driven representations of them. Moreover\nbecause Raymond sees transsexuality as essentially a male phenomenon,\nher discussion of FTMs is minimal. She argues that FTMs are mere tokens\nwho are used to prop up claims that transsexuality is a universal\nphenomenon and thereby hide its true patriarchal character. In this\nway, FTM transsexuality is largely dropped out of the picture (xxiii,\n27–28, 140; for further critique see Califia 1997, 100–1, Serano 2007,\n48). This allows her to avoid discussing FTM transsexuals in any depth\nat all. And this means that the complex, variable, everyday experiences\nof FTMs do not get represented in the first place. Consider, for\nexample, Raymond's claim “All transsexuals rape\nwomen's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact,\nappropriating this body for themselves.” While the statement\npurports to be universal, it is also a claim specifically about MTF\ntranssexuals. In Raymond's account, there is no room for FTMs.\nThey are erased. \n\nWhile this tendency to forgo consideration of the real life\nexperiences of trans people in favor of monolithic, stereotypical\nrepresentations of them (or through outright erasure) seems to have\nbeen common in academic writing at the time, it is also worth noting\nthe deep theoretical and political commitments at work. Raymond's\naccount is situated within a lesbian-separatist paradigm which sees\nwomen's oppression as secured through compulsory heterosexual\nrelationships (Radicalesbians [1970] 1988). In this heterosexual\ncontext, women are forced to adopt an identity that is male-dominant\n(man-identified). Liberation from the colonization of identity can only\nbe obtained through lesbian relationships and a community of\nwomen-identified women. Central to this paradigm of oppression/\nliberation, then, is the view that a woman's identity can be\nthoroughly colonized as well as the view that this can possibly be\neliminated through loving lesbian relationships (Frye 1983). It is one,\nthen, which does not see the self as inherently bound up with gender or\nsex role. \n\nGiven this account, it is no surprise that Raymond criticizes\nMoney's view that gender identity, while determined by\nenvironmental factors, is “locked down” at an early age\n(1979, 62–8). And given the separation between sex and role, it becomes\napparent why transsexual claims about gender identity become hard to\nfathom. On the one hand, identity might involve the internalization of\nand identification with the sexist gender roles from which, according\nto Raymond, we need to find transcendence. This would obviously cry out\nfor feminist intervention. On the other hand, since Raymond accepts a\nview according to which sex is a given, biological substrate upon which\ncultural role is assigned, identity may simply be taken to reflect\nrecognition of one's own invariant biological sex (male or\nfemale). Such an identity would survive any transcendence from cultural\nsex role. In this case, however, any purported misalignment between\nbody and identity would seem deeply misguided (since identity merely\nreflects one's invariant biological sex). \n\nIn 1977 a controversy erupted in lesbian-separatist circles over\nSandy Stone, an openly transsexual woman and an engineer who had been\nworking at Olivia Records (an all-woman recording company). Both she\nand Olivia were explicitly targeted by Raymond in The Transsexual\nEmpire. After leaving Olivia, Stone earned her doctorate under\nDonna Haraway at Santa Cruz, and in 1991 published a reply to Raymond\nand what would become the founding essay in transgender\nstudies, “The Empire Strikes Back: A (post)transsexual\nmanifesto” (Stryker 2008, 105, 124–5). \nStone takes up a third position in opposition to both the medicalized\nview of transsexuality characterized by Benjamin's\nThe Transsexual Phenomenon and the feminist critique offered in\nRaymond's The Transsexual Empire. The fundamental move of\nthe essay is to see transsexuals as a kind of “oppressed\nminority.” While Stone does not position transsexuals as a third\ngender, she does propose that transsexuals “currently occupy a\nposition which is nowhere, which is outside the binary oppositions of\ngendered discourse” (1991, 295). Because Stone wishes to avoid\nappeal to a pre-existing class of individuals who are then oppressed,\nshe represents transsexuality as a genre of discourse. The\nidea is that traditional medical discourse about transsexuality\nconstitutes a distinctive, regulated way of talking and\ntheorizing which Stone calls a genre. (Contrast, for example,\ntraditional medical discourse on transsexuality with Raymond's\nfeminist discourse on transsexuality). Stone is suspicious of appealing\nto a group of individuals prior to the workings of a\nparticular discourse (that is, one which is conceived of as independent\nof a particular discourse) since, goes the postmodern worry, such an\nappeal to this group of individuals would nonetheless be at the same\ntime providing an account of them within a discourse—a\ndiscourse which could be shaped by ideological commitments. Instead of\ntrying to make such a move, then, Stone identifies a group of\nindividuals as represented through traditional medical discourse about\ntranssexuality. \n\nDrawing on the autobiographies of some transsexual women, Stone\nfinds herself in agreement with Raymond in worrying about what she sees\nas the uptake of sexist stereotypes by (some) MTFs (1991, 289).\nHowever, she also notes (some) MTF insistence upon a\nmale/female binary and the absence of any middle or more complex gender\nground (286). Beyond this, she criticizes the subjectivity-erasing,\nblanket claims in Raymond's work (e.g., “All transsexuals\nrape women's bodies”) along with the implicit denial of\ntranssexual subjectivity discussed above (298). \n\nWhat is lacking, according to Stone, is space for the discourse of\ntranssexuals as transsexuals. She points to ways in which the\nmedicalization of transsexuality has required both the uptake of sexist\nbehavior as well as the acquiescence to a strict gender\nbinary. In this way, she argues, transsexuals have been complicit in\ntelling a story within a genre that does not necessarily reflect their\nown subjective experiences (1991, 295). At the same time, argues Stone,\ntranssexuals have also developed their own subcultures as well as\ndistinctive practices within those subcultures that entirely run\nagainst the official account of transsexuality (such as helping each\nother know what to say and how to act in order to get medically\ndesignated as a transsexual) (291–2). The solution, Stone argues, is\nfor transsexuals to begin telling their own stories (295). This\nrequires minimally, that post-operative transsexuals come out as\ntranssexual and forego passing as (non-transsexual) men and women\n(298–9). The traditional medical requirement that one construct a\nplausible non-trans history to hide one's past, for Stone,\nundermines the possibility of authentic relationships. Because the\ninjunction to forego passing as the (non-transsexual) sex one has\ntransitioned into runs entirely against the prevalent discourse of\ntranssexuality as such, Stone represents the political move as\npost-transsexual (299). She sees that while many transsexuals\nare complicit in this discourse, they nonetheless go beyond it\nby attempting, for example, to assist each other in\n“working” the medical regulations (as explained above).\nThus their experiences and actions outstrip the\n“official” medical accounts of transsexuality. Yet this\n“outstripping” is rendered invisible in any complicit\nattempt to fit into a medical account which requires that one's\nstatus as transsexual be ultimately denied in everyday life (through\nthis construction of a false history). For Stone, eschewing this\ndiscourse is important because it hides the complex, variable\nexperiences of different trans people who are often positioned in\ncontestatory ways vis a vis this discourse. The move is not designed to\nfind some one authentic and uniform account of transsexuals beyond the\nmedical discourse. It is, rather, to clear the way for discourses from\nwhich it is at least possible to speak and to speak politically\nas a transsexual. \n\nStone's manifesto relies on an account of\noppression/resistance that breaks sharply from the utopian vision found\nin Raymond's work. Instead, it draws largely on the ideas of\nHaraway's “A Cyborg Manifesto” (1983, 1991) and\nGloria Anzaldúa's theory of the mestiza (1987). It will be\nworth discussing these views briefly to draw out the nature of\nStone's theoretical departure from Raymond. \n\nHaraway's postmodern image of the cyborg (explained below) is\nintended to raise worries, derived largely from writings of women of\ncolor, about single, monolithic (identity-based) accounts of\noppression/liberation. Haraway worries about political accounts which\npostulate an original state of innocence and subsequent fall from grace\nand which then envision a utopian future which promises a return to\ninnocence. \n\nAccording to Haraway, the difficulty with such theories is that they\nare partial in their account of the world (while assuming universality)\nand so end up ignoring (and even promoting) certain forms of oppression\n(1991, 156). For example, a feminist vision which posits a shared\nexperience of oppression among women and recommends lesbian-separatism\nas its solution, as formulated, leaves out the experience of racial\noppression among women of color (Combahee River Collective 1981). Why\nshould women of color be expected to forego solidarity with progressive\nmen of color? \n\nThe cyborg, then, is a collection of disparate, incongruent parts:\nEach individual contains multiple elements of oppressor and oppressed.\nAs a metaphor, it is intended to refuse postulations of original\ninnocence and utopian future (1991, 151). Instead, resistance for\nHaraway is possible due only to the possibility of the cyborg's\nturning against the intentions of its maker in a dystopian environment\n(151). This idea is notably taken up by Susan Stryker (1994), who uses\nthe metaphor of Frankenstein's monster, in her reply to Mary\nDaly's (1978) representation of transsexuals as monstrous\nboundary violators. \n\nThis notion of mixture is also central in the work of\nAnzaldúa, who speaks against an emphasis on purity and in favor\nof the notion of mixed race (una raza mestiza) (1987, 99). She\nrecognizes herself as a border dweller, torn between the demands of\nconflicting cultures (for example, anglo and Mexican) (1987, 100). The\nexperience of being caught in the confluence of multiple cultures leads\nto a kind of multiplicity or fragmentation of self. For example, one\nmight be represented in a racist manner in dominant white forms of\nfeminism and in a sexist manner in dominant forms of racial resistance.\nThis tension between conflicting cultural perspectives yields the\npossibility of “double” or “Mestiza”\nconsciousness which involves the capacity to see oneself in accordance\nwith the dominant ways in which one is oppressively represented and\nconstrained in different, and often conflicting ways (101–2). \n\nIt is precisely the capacity to be conscious of this plurality of\nthe self, in Anzaldúa's view, that allows for resistance,\nsince there is an awareness which outstrips the multiple forms of\noppression by viewing them together, as well as in conflict (1987,\n102). Such a consciousness also allows for the possibility of\n“linguistic terrorism”—the creative blending of\ndisparate languages and cultures in ways that work against the\nmonolithic character of each (1987, 75–86). For example, Chicano Texas\nSpanish and Tex-Mex involve such a linguistic blending.\nAnzaldúa writes, “Until I am free to write bilingually and\nto switch codes without having always to translate … my tongue\nwill be illegitimate” (81). And: “We are your linguistic\nnightmare, your linguistic aberration, your linguistic\nmestizaje …” (80). \n\nWhile neither Haraway nor Anzaldúa explicitly discuss\nRaymond, it is clear that the position articulated in the\nThe Transsexual Empire is vulnerable to their concerns.\nRaymond's vision provides both an origin account as well as the\npromise of salvation: The original imposition of sex roles and the\nfinal achievement of integrity through freedom from them\n(1979, 164). And Raymond's dismissal of integration (the\nmish-mash of incongruent parts) is precisely celebrated by Haraway and\nAnzaldúa, who have no patience for the alleged\n“innocence” and “purity” of integrity.\nSignificantly, Anzaldúa identifies a state between man and woman\nas a site for creative resistance: \n\nAlthough Stone does not explicitly use the expression “double\nconsciousness”, it is evidently at work in her suggestion that\ntranssexuals have learned to adopt the discourse of medicalization\nwhile doing so within a subaltern transsexual culture which fails to\naccurately correspond to the official account. Certainly her suggestion\nthat transsexuals speak beyond the gender binary is anticipated in\nAnzaldúa's work, as is her call to mix-and-match\ngenres. \n\nThe differences between a vision of the self as a site for potential\ngender colonization /decolonization (as presupposed by Raymond) and a\nvision which emphasizes “mestiza consciousness” are\nsignificant. María Lugones (1990), for example, argues that the\nformer type of vision, as articulated by philosophers such as Frye\n(1983), simply cannot succeed as a theory of resistance. The\ndifficulty, in part, is that the former seems to postulate a self\nunderlying the cultural work of oppression or at least the possibility\nof a self that has been or could be freed entirely from culture (or at\nleast gender). Yet, if such a possibility is not realistic, as it seems\nnot to be, it is hard to see how any form of resistance to oppression\ncan get a foot-hold. How can the colonized mind be open to\ntransformation and resistance given that it is already colonized? It is\nprecisely this possibility of “double consciousness”,\nargues Lugones (1990), which makes resistance possible at all. \n\nStone's article laid the foundations for the emergence of\ntransgender studies, which can be characterized as the\ncoming-to-academic-voice of (some) trans people against a history of\nscholarly objectification. The early nineties also witnessed the\nemergence of current transgender politics, articulated in the popular\nworks of Leslie Feinberg (1992, 1993, 1996, 1998) and Kate Bornstein\n(1994). Three major features of what might be called the transgender\nparadigm paralleled the ideas of Stone: 1) the recognition of\ngender-based oppression, usually targeting trans people, as distinct\nfrom and non-reducible to sexist oppression; 2) the positioning of\ntrans people as problematically situated with respect to the binary\ncategories man and woman; and 3) the endorsement\nof a politics of visibility. \n\nThis is not to suggest that such politics are uniform. For example,\nwhile Feinberg tends to emphasize the historical persistence of\ntransgender people as a kind of people or oppressed group, Bornstein\ntends to emphasize the constructed (and oppressive) nature of gender\ncategories as a whole, the desirability of viewing gender as fashion,\nand the importance of moving toward a more consensual gender system.\nNotably, Bornstein draws on the ethnomethodological work of Garfinkel\n(1967) and Kessler and McKenna (1977). The work of Kessler and McKenna\nis especially remarkable for its early broad use of\n‘gender’ to apply even to biological sex in order to\nindicate the implication of sex within cultural interpretation and\npractice. Ethnomethodology is a sociological analysis of how\nindividuals construct their common-sense knowledge of the world in\nsocial contexts. Bornstein draws principally on Garfinkel's\nnotion of the natural attitude about sex. This attitude, for\nGarfinkel, constitutes the everyday “common-sense” about\nsex. It is held by those he dubbed “normals” for whom the\ncategories male and female are exclusive, exhaustive, invariant, and\napplied on the basis of genitalia. Notably, part of the natural\nattitude involves dismissing counter-examples (e.g., intersexual\nindividuals who show that the neat categorization of humans into two\ndiscrete categories is bogus) as abnormal and aberrant.  \n\nAt any rate, these and other popular works characterized and perhaps\nprovided the foundation for the emerging Anglo-American transgender\npolitics of the 1990s which while insisting upon the distinction\nbetween gender identity and presentation (on the one hand) and sexual\norientation (on the other) also fought for representation within LGB\npolitics. This led to the development of a somewhat more inclusive LGBT\npolitics, grounded in the idea that gender-variant individuals had\nalways, in the first place, been central to gay and lesbian liberation\nand that gay and lesbian individuals themselves may be subject to\ndiscrimination on the basis of gender presentation. \n\nThe emergence of transgender politics included the prolonged\nconflict between trans activists and non trans feminists over the\nexclusion of trans women from the Michigan Womyn's Music\nFestival. In 1994, the trans activist group, Transexual Menace,\norganized ‘Camp Trans’ directly opposite the festival. (The\nterm transexual, spelled with one s, was intended to\nsignal a break from the traditional medical conception of\ntranssexuality). The point was to challenge what was seen as the\nfestival organizers' transphobic attempt to exclude trans women\nthrough its ‘womyn-born womyn’ policy. The political\nconflict persists to this day. \n\nIn 1994, The Transsexual Empire was re-issued with a new\nintroduction by Raymond that explicitly takes up the new transgender\npolitics. Her critique largely involves the claim that any gender\ntransgression by transgender people still involves the uptake of sexist\ngender roles and therefore fails at genuine gender transcendence (1994,\nxxix). In Raymond's view, most self-identified transgender people\nare predominantly men who are in some way performing a stereotypical\nand sexist femininity (ibid.). However, she also discusses\nFeinberg's Stone Butch Blues, a novel which played an\nimportant, informative role in the emergence of transgender politics.\nIn this novel, we follow the lead protagonist, Jess, who moves from the\ncategory of butch (in butch-femme lesbian subculture) to the\ncategory transsexual, and who then recognizes that transition\nfrom female to male is likewise unfulfilling. Jess ends up occupying a\nmiddle ground, identifying simply as a ‘he-she.’\nRaymond's major concern with this trajectory is that,\nJess ultimately refuses self-identification as a woman (1994,\nxxxii). \n\nRaymond's theoretical framework regarding gender transcendence\nand a strict biological binary prior to cultural imposition guides this\ndiscussion. Given her distinction between integration and integrity,\nany mixing and matching of gender would fail to achieve the goal of\ncomplete gender transcendence, and therefore fail as a politics of\nliberation. Moreover, given that she does not allow room for a third\nspace between man and woman, given that she does not recognize trans\noppression as somewhat independent of sexist oppression, and given that\nwomen-identified-women are central to her views about resistance, it is\nhardly surprising that she should be dismayed by Jess' decision.\nAside from problems mentioned with this theory earlier, it is worth\nadding that, as Cressida Heyes notes, Raymond's theory, which\nrejects transgender resistance a priori, seems to be unfalsifiable\n(2003, 1108). \n\n The impact of Judith Butler's Gender\nTrouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990) was\nimmediate and profound. Instead of being oppositional, the\nground-breaking work of Butler bears a much more complex relation to\ntransgender individuals and to trans studies. \n\nButler's work was partly motivated by the desire to answer\nconcerns that queer enactments of gender (as in a butch-femme\nrelationship or in gay male drag) merely replicate traditional\npatriarchal norms. For Butler, such a view presupposes a heterosexual\nbias obscuring the way in which gender is re-worked in queer contexts.\nWhat she has in mind is that in queer subculture gender practices do\nnot always have the same meaning that they do in mainstream cultural\ncontexts. For example, feminine presentation in some queer contexts may\ninvolve a degree of irony not found in mainstream instances of that\nfeminine presentation. To treat queer gender practices as simply\nrepeating or miming non-queer practices without any significant change\nin meaning is to understand all gender practices in a way that assigns\ndominant heterosexual meanings to it. \n\nQueer gender performance, far from replicating patriarchal norms,\ncan subvert such norms by exposing their non-natural, imitative\ncharacter (1990, 174–80). Sometimes queer gender performance can\ninvolve irony and/or parody through exaggeration. (Good examples of\nthis can be found in early films by John Waters, such as Female\nTrouble). Queer gender can make fun of heterosexual gender\npractices by exaggerating them and parodying them in such ways that\nmake them seem theatrical and contrived. And gay male drag, for Butler,\ncan show that feminine presentation is not the sole property of female\nindividuals. Once it is recognized that such behavior is only\ncontingently assigned to groups of individuals, the very idea that gay\ndrag merely involves imitation of heterosexual women as the original\nassigns a priority to the latter over the former. This prioritization,\nfor Butler, reflects a heterosexual bias. And, so for Butler, feminist\nidentification of all gendered behavior as inherently\nsexist (as, for example, found in Raymond's work) is nothing\nshort of a heterosexist tendency to attach a primacy to heterosexual\ngender performance. \n\nButler's account of gender aims to call into question the\npre-existence of a group of individuals (i.e., women, females) prior to\nthe enforcement of gender role. Instead, in Butler's view,\nbiological sex is culturally instituted and in this sense “gender\nall along.” Prima facie this view seems counter-intuitive. One\nway to motivate it is to recognize that contrary to the natural\nattitude about sex (discussed above), human beings cannot always be\nneatly divided into male and female. Indeed, once we recognize various\nfeatures which go into sex determination (chromosomal sex, gonadal sex,\ngenital sex, etc.) we see that sex is not a single, unitary,\neasily-determined feature. Insofar as the natural attitude prevails,\nhowever, individuals act as if the natural attitude were true.\nSex is now understood in terms of a particular attitude which shapes\neveryday social practices. And to the extent that such an attitude\nhelps ground medical practices designed to surgically assign intersex\ninfants to one sex or the other, it appears that sexual dimorphism is\nmedically instituted. Insofar as bodies are made to conform to a\nparticular cultural ideology about sex—an ideology which governs\nsocial practice—it makes some sense to say that biological sex itself\nis, to this degree, “culturally instituted.” \n\nIn Butler's view, whenever we discuss the body, we are also\nalways representing it in culturally specific ways. To speak of the\nbiologically sexed body as somehow prior to particular discourses\nabout it is to, in so doing, nonetheless ironically speak about\nit within some particular discourse and hence to represent in\nsome way.  According to Butler, sex is culturally instituted by\nrepresenting the body as the natural container of some inner,\ngendered self.  Sex is understood as the bodily indication that\nconcealed within it is the essence of either a woman or a man. For\nButler, this view is false.  However, just as the natural attitude may\nbe treated as if it were true even though it is not, so, too, bodies\ncan be falsely treated as containers of gendered selves. To the extent\nthat this view is pervasive and regulative of human conduct, one\ncan—in this sense—say that sex is socially\nconstructed. \n\nFor Butler, behavioral manifestations of gender are often taken to\nexpress a prior gender identity that is contained within a naturally\nsexed body. Thus, feminine behavior is seen as expressive of an inner\nfeminine core (contained within the body sexed female). On the\ncontrary, in her view, such performances simply serve to generate the\nfiction of a pre-existing gender identity as well as the fiction of the\nsexed body qua natural container of this identity (1990, 178–9). This\nis to say: Behavioral manifestations are prior to gender identity and\nsexed body (rather than the other way around). The illusion of a stably\nsexed body, core gender identity, and (hetero) sexual orientation is\nperpetuated through repeated, stylized bodily performances that are\nperformative in the sense that they are productive of the\nfiction of a stable identity, orientation, and sexed body as prior to\nthe gendered behavior (173). \n\nThis allows Butler to answer the charge that queer gender\nperformances merely replicate sexist gender role behavior. In her view,\nall gender behavior is imitative in nature. Heterosexual\ngender identity involves an instability that it attempts to cover over:\nWhile it purports to be grounded in a naturally gendered core, it\namounts to nothing more than repeated attempts to imitate past\ninstances of gendered behavior (1990, 185). Thus, there is also a\nsubversive potential of queer drag and camp gender performance, in her\nview, insofar as it can parody and thereby expose this\nconcealed imitative quality (1990, 174–6). As a consequence, Butler\nwelcomes the proliferation of queer gender behaviors that re-signify,\nparody, and expose the mechanisms by which the fiction of normative\nheterosexist gender is created (1990, 184–190). \n\nWhile Butler's theory was initially viewed by some as a kind\nof gender voluntarism, it is clear that this is very far from her\nactual view, further refined in Bodies that Matter (1993).\nButler clarifies that instead of a kind of voluntary theatricality\ndonned and doffed by a pre-existing agent, gender performance is\nconstitutive of the agent itself. For Butler, even though the self is\nthe mere effect of repeated gender performances, it is nonetheless\nreal: There are selves, they are socially constructed. What is strictly\nfictional, for Butler, is the view that they are unified cores which\nexist prior to gendered behavior. Butler does not want to deny\nthe existence of our psychic lives. \n\nFor Butler, gender performance is citational in that it\ntacitly cites or draws on gender norms (1993, 12–3;\n230–33). But it is precisely this citing of the norm as\nauthoritative which confers authority upon the norm (1993,\n13). Indeed, the agent herself as the one who either willfully\ncomplies or fails to comply with the authoritative norm is likewise\nproduced through this process of citation (1993, 13, 225, 232). Thus,\nButler sees the agent qua unified source of gendered behavior as\nperformatively constituted through repeated acts of gendered\nbehavior. This is to say: The ‘agent’ is, far from the\ncause of gendered performance, its effect (1990, 184–5; 1991,\n24; 1993, 232). \n\nSuch a view yields a kind of paradox: If the agent is the mere effect\nof the repeated acts, then how are the acts themselves produced?  The\nconcerns may be mitigated to some extent by recognizing that Butler is\ninterested in the very formation of self-identity as understood within\na psychoanalytic tradition. She follows Freud in seeing the ego as\nformed largely through a process of complex identifications.\nIdentification, in this context, is to be understood as the stable\npsychic “taking on” of perceived properties of a lost love\nobject (1990, 73–84; 1991 26–7). In this way, the lost\nobject becomes a part of the ego through a process of imitation: The\nobject is internalized (and psychically “preserved”). \n\nIn Butler's view, the taboo against (heterosexual) incest presupposes\na prior taboo against homosexuality (which effectively constitutes\nheterosexual desire as such) (1990, 82). Yet the taboo requires that\nthe loved object as well as the homosexual desire itself be given\nup. In a process of melancholy the lost object is not grieved because\nthe desire cannot even be acknowledge in the first place. So the lost\nobject is internalized through this process of identification by which\nthe individual now psychically takes on the attributes of the lost\nobject, thereby acquiring a heterosexual gender identity (1990,\n78–81; 1991, 26–7). In this way, imitation lies at the\nroot of the very formation of gender identity. \n\nFor Butler the term psyche applies to more than simply the\nself or ego as constituted through gender imitation. In addition to the\nconscious self, she is also interested in the psychic workings of the\nunconscious as postulated in psychoanalysis. In Butler's view,\nthe psyche outstrips the performatively constituted agent insofar as\nthe repeated acts fail to entirely imitate the preceding ones and,\nindeed, insofar as they must be repeated at all (1991, 24). Butler\nallows for “psychic excess” which applies to that which is\nboth presupposed by and yet excluded by heterosexual gender identities.\nFor example, the love of the lost object discussed above cannot be\nallowed into the heterosexual gender identity. Nonetheless it is part\nof the psyche—is “psychic excess”—insofar as it is\nessentially presupposed by and yet disowned in the formation of\nheterosexual gender identity. Such excess manifests itself, for Butler,\nin performative failures and in behaviors which expose the imitative\ncharacter of gender (24–5). \n\nThis involves a notable departure from the “double\nconsciousness” model of resistance (and identity) discussed\nabove. Rather than flagging the simultaneous blending of conflicting\ncultural claims to form a subject position that is constituted by its\nborderland status, Butler deploys the notion of “psychic\nexcess” and points to the re-significations of performance (as\nwithin a historical chain) in ways that subvert a stable\nsubject position altogether. This means that Butler situates subversion\nin disruptions which fail to imitate in the same way, which expose and\nundermine the illusion of a stable self. Despite this difference,\nhowever, both the notion of “double consciousness” and\nButler's theory of gender performativity similarly depart from\nRaymond's view which postulates a self at least ideally freed\nfrom oppressive machinations. \n\nIn light of her appeal to citationality, Butler further clarifies that\nthe subversive potential of gender performance is significantly\nconstrained since, in order for gender performance to be subversive,\nit still must cite existing gender norms as norms (1993, 122–4,\n226–7).  This means that gender subversion is limited by the\nhistory of past iterations of gender performance. Butler also allows\nthat there are ways in which gender performance can both replicate and\nsubvert sexist, racist, and heterosexist norms at once. For example,\nshe aims to defend an ambivalent picture of the culture portrayed in\nJennie Livington's 1991 film Paris is Burning which documents\nthe drag ball competitions of various ‘houses’ in New York\nCity, held by mostly black and latino/a queer men, transsexuals, and\nqueens (1993, 121–140). \n\nButler's discussion of the film is especially notable for its\nexplicit treatment of transsexuality. She is largely responding to bell\nhooks who criticizes the film for the invisibility of the subject\nposition of the director (a white, Yale-educated, lesbian woman) in\nshaping an objectifying spectacle of non-white gender and sexuality\n(1992, 150–1) and the very behavior and attitudes of the individuals\ndocumented in the film (147–50). Following in the tradition of Raymond,\nhooks raises worries about the masculinity involved in the drag\nperformances (citing the competitive edge involved in the balls as well\nas the celebration of sexual objectification) (148–9). Moreover, she\npoints out that white femininity seems elevated in these balls as the\ncanonical form of femininity (150). Butler, by contrast, aims to\nhighlight both subversion and the ways in which such subversion is\nconstrained and even erased through dominant heterosexist forms of\ngender. \n\nThe bulk of Butler's defense of this ambivalence derives from\nher discussion of the life and death of Venus Xtravaganza, a light\nskinned Latina, and self-identified pre-operative transsexual woman.\nXtravaganza dreams of a happy, suburban, heterosexual life but works as\na prostitute and is ultimately killed. On the one hand, Butler sees the\nmurder as the effect of the dominant order to annihilate that which\nsubverts its (in this case, Xtravaganza's\n“in-between” body and gender incongruence) (1993, 131). On\nthe other hand, Butler sees the murder of Xtravaganza as flowing from\nher “tragic misreading of the social map of power” where\nher hopes to live a happy life in the suburbs are shattered when she is\ntreated in the way in which women of color are treated (1993, 131).\nWhile Butler sees Xtravaganza's life is genuinely subversive of\ndominant regulations of gender, she also raises worries about the\nnature of Xtravaganza's desire for gender realness as a\nmiddle-class, heterosexual woman (133) . In Butler's view, this\ndesire is primarily an attempt to transcend race and class through\ngender transformation (130). \n\nButler's theory has the advantage of answering Raymond's\nassumption that all gendered behavior is inherently replicative of\nsexist norms, by providing a theoretical basis for the subversive\npotential of some queer gender performance and by jettisoning a view\nwhich sees biological male/female sex as independent of culture. In\nthis way, her work is highly congenial to transgender theory and\npolitics. Yet Butler's theory also has some significant\ndifficulties which have led some trans scholars to voice strong\nobjections to her work. \n\nNotably, Butler's theory leaves the charges of gender\nreplication entirely applicable to those trans people who see\nthemselves and who behave as “real” men and women, as her\naccount of Xtravaganza indicates. The tension involves her account of\ngender identity as socially constructed as well as her account of\nsubversion (on the one hand), and the importance of gender identity and\ngender realness to some trans people (on the other). To be sure, there\nis no obvious theoretical tension here, since Butler can explain the\nimportance of gender identity and gender realness. The problem, rather,\nis that this vision may not be politically useful for trans folk who\nseek to emphasize the importance of gender identity and realness for\nsome trans people. \n\nThe tension seems to derive, in part, from the fact that\nButler's aims to defend some forms of queer gender behavior in\nopposition to heterosexual gender behavior. In this model,\ntransgressive gender performance is closely wedded to non-heterosexual\nsexuality (Prosser 1998, 31–32). In arguing that Xtravaganza is killed\nbecause of her gender subversion, Butler must understand this as\nbreaking from demands of heterosexuality (Prosser 1998, 46). What is\nmissing from such an account is recognition of trans oppression as a\nmodality in some ways distinct from the heterosexism. \n\nPerhaps more problematically, Butler's suggestion that\nXtravanganza is killed as a woman of color elides the specifics of\nviolence against trans women: Xtravangaza was not killed as a Latina\nwoman, but as a Latina transsexual, working as prostitute (Prosser\n1998, 47, Namaste 2000, 13). Moreover, Butler's suggestion that\nsex-change, for Xtravaganza, is an imagined vehicle to transcend her\neconomic and racial conditions fails to take sufficiently serious her\ntranssexual identity (Namaste 2000, 13–4). Indeed, both Jay\nProsser (1998, 50–55) and Viviane Namaste (2000, 14) argue that\nButler's treatment of Xtravaganza involves allegorizing\nher life and death as a way to generate theoretical mileage for her own\nviews while failing to make room for her as a person who lived and died\nas a transsexual. In addition to such concerns, deeper theoretical\nworries about Butler's position are raised by both Prosser (1998)\nand Namaste (2000). \n\nProsser (1998) takes issue with Butler's view at the\ntheoretical level of identity and body. For Butler, the acquisition of\na gender identity (along with the corresponding heterosexual desire)\ninvolves the selection of certain bodily pleasures as acceptable and\nthe rejection of others as unacceptable (1990, 89–90). This selection\nof appropriate pleasure is determined in such a way that pleasures do\nnot literally derive from a particular body part “where”\nthey are located (90–1). Rather the sexual pleasure derives from the\neroticization of that body part (i.e., by its role as an\nobject in erotic fantasy). In heterosexual\n“incorporation” the eroticization of body parts is falsely\nliteralized where the body part is then construed as the\n“container” and “source” of sexual bodily\npleasure (87–90). In this way, the subjective experience of one's\nsexed body is nothing but a literalized fantasy. \n\nIn response to this account, Prosser claims that Butler misreads\nFreud according to whom, he argues, the body ego really does arise\nfrom the body (1998, 40–2). Prosser appeals to Didier Anzieu's\nnotion of the “skin ego”—the “inner\nexperience” of the body arising from bodily sensations—which\nserves as a significant interface between psyche and body (65–67). This\nallows Prosser to argue that transsexuals appeal to the notion of the\n‘wrong body’ because it simply feels that way\n(68–9). His account of body ego departs from Butler in emphasizing\nbodily sensation and proprioceptive awareness, rather than the\nvisualization of bodily surface (78–9). Prosser deploys notions of\nbodily agnosia (the neurological inability to track parts of\none's body) (78) and phantom limb experiences (84–5) to\nhelp explain the way in which a transsexual's body image may not\naccord with their actual body. \n\nProsser's view has the advantage of offering a more plausible\naccount of the body ego. Yet it is also worth remarking that little\nattention is paid to the way in which social conceptions of the body\nmight impact the ego. By grounding transsexuality so thoroughly in the\nbody, Prosser's view does not appear well-equipped to accommodate\ntranssexual self-identifications as woman or man\nwhere such identifications involve more than the body, but also social\nrole. In this way, Prosser seems to offer a conception of self (or at\nleast bodily self) which is implausibly independent of cultural\ndemands. \n\nWhile Prosser's work primarily focuses on Butler's\npsychoanalytic account of ego formation, Viviane Namaste's (2000)\nfocuses on Butler's account of queer drag as subversive. In\nNamaste's view, Butler fails to heed to the larger social context\nin which gay male drag is situated and through which gender is\nregulated. Namaste points to the social facts that gay male drag\nperformance is often restricted to entertainment on the stage where it\nis viewed as “mere performance.” By contrast, gay male\nsexual identity is not restricted to the stage and is not viewed as\n“mere performance” (10–13). Given that Butler allows for an\nambivalence in subversion, however, it isn't clear that her view\ncannot accommodate these social facts in the way that she theorizes\ndrag performance in Paris is Burning. Yet Namaste aims for a\ndeeper theoretical critique, charging Butler with departing from a\npost-structuralist framework which situates such phenomena precisely\nwithin a broader social analysis she sees lacking in Butler's\naccount (16–23). \n\nBy using drag as a way to represent and theorize all gender\nrelations, argues Namaste, Butler fails to examine the multiple concrete\nways in which gender is regulated in everyday life (20–1). It\nisn't clear that this by itself undermines Butler's claim\nthat some gender behavior can be genuinely subversive (and indeed,\nButler does not point only to drag, but also butch/femme presentations\nof gender). However, it may nonetheless raise worries about\nButler's attempt to offer a uniform theory of gender as\nimitation. Given that degree of abstraction from concrete social\ncircumstance, it may be that Butler omits crucial elements of gender\nthat are specific to various concrete social practices. \nButler's more recent work has to some extent attempted to\nmitigate some of the preceding concerns (2004). She indicates that she\nhas been informed by what she calls “The New Gender\nPolitics” (i.e., the activism initiated by intersexual,\ntransgender, and transsexual people) (Butler 2004, 4). Where the notion\nof “doing” gender is central to her earlier work, the\nnotion of “undoing” now becomes central. She is concerned\nspecifically with the notion of the “human” and the fact\nthat some people are recognized as less human or, in some ways, not\nrecognized as human at all (2004, 2). Insofar as this is a function of\nwhat counts as intelligible gender, one can be “undone” by\ngender (rendered unintelligible or recognized as less human) (2–3).\nInsofar as gender is relational, and for Butler now often involves\nacting for another, one can be “undone” by those to whom we\nare vulnerable (22–5). Thus, we may be undone through the loss of a\nclose friend, just as we may be undone through acts of phobic\nviolence. \nButler now seeks to find a balance between the demand for autonomy\n(required by a democratizing ideal to which she explicitly subscribes)\nand the fact that such autonomy does not flow from an atomistic self,\nbut rather its grounding in the particular ideologies and institutions\nwhich necessarily connect us with others and deny certain individuals\nthe status of human (37–9, 223–7). Her demand, then, is to\ndistinguish norms which foreclose the possibility of livable lives for\nthose rendered marginal, and those which open up possibilities\n“to live and breathe and move”(2004, 8, 31,219). In this\nway, she aims to offer a more nuanced approach to the importance of\nidentity in democratic politics, explicitly taking up a “tension\nthat arises between queer theory and both intersex and transsexual\nactivism” which “centers on the question of sex assignment\nand the desirability of identity categories” (7). Effectively,\nthen, Butler recognizes that insofar as queer theory aims to undermine\nthe “illusion” of stable identities while arguing against\nthe viability of a politics based upon identity categories, it is in\nopposition to intersex and transsexual activism both of which are\ncentered upon identities (i.e., intersex identity and transsexual\nidentity). Conceding some ground, Butler recognizes that a livable\nlife “does require various degrees of stability” (8). Her\nearlier work found subversion only in the disruption of\nstable identity. She recognizes here, however, that without some\nstability, life is not livable. \nShe also reconsiders her earlier appeal to drag. For Butler, what is\nimportant about drag is only that it reveals the possibility that what\nis taken as a given is really cultural and that it can be contested and\nassigned new meanings (213–9). However, while her earlier view had\ninsisted more strongly upon the importance of subverting the norm\nthrough its exposure as imitative, what now seem more important are\nthe different kinds of norms at stake, and whether they\nconduce to possibilities of livable lives for those who are\nmarginalized. \nNotably, Butler considers the political tension between those trans\nactivists who would oppose the Gender Identity Disorder as\npathologizing and paternalistic, and those who insist upon its\nimportance in securing access to medical technologies, recommending the\nstrategic use of the diagnosis. While the latter view underestimates\nthat degree to which such a move further empowers the existing\nstructural arrangement and inflicts damage upon those who undergo the\nregulations (82–3), the former fail to see how, in practice, movement\naway from some medical regulation is not going to be possible without\nalso completely undermining access to the technology (90–1). In\nButler's view, the institutional mechanisms which permit access\nthrough medical regulation and psychological evaluation, allow for a\nkind of culturally circumscribed access to autonomy, but only at the\ncost of “undoing” oneself (91). Butler sees this bind of\n“undoing oneself” in order to “do oneself” as\ncharacteristic of the general way in which autonomy is both culturally\ndenied and bestowed (100–1). \nWhile Butler's modified view in some ways eases the tension\nbetween her theory of gender and the demands of trans politics, it is\nworth noting that the theory does not deliver many details in\nterms of trans oppression and possibilities for resistance. Her\ndiscussion of Gender Identity Disorder is a case in point. It leaves us\nwith a powerful illustration of her theoretical claims about autonomy;\nyet it does not offer much in terms of concrete political\nstrategies. \nBernice Hausman's Changing Sex: Transsexualism, Technology,\nand the Idea of Gender (1995) aims to provide a feminist analysis\nof transsexuality within a Foucauldian paradigm. While her theoretical\nframework differs markedly from Raymond's, she also shares\nRaymond's concern about transsexuality as well as her deep\ndistrust of medical intervention on the body. \n\nFor Hausman, the primary hallmark of transsexuality is the sheer\ndemand for transsexual surgeries through which transsexual subjects are\nconstituted as such (1995, 110). As a consequence,\nshe sees transsexual subjectivity as entirely dependent upon medical\ntechnology. In Hausman's view, transsexuals and doctors work\ninterdependently to produce “the standard account” of\ntranssexuality which serves as a “cover” for the demand for\nsurgery and to justify access to the medical technologies (110, 138–9).\nBehind the “cover” there is only the problematic demand to,\nthrough technology, engineer oneself as a subject. Because of this,\nHausman claims that transsexual agency can be “read\nthrough” the medical discourse (110). \n\nA corollary of her view is that the very notion of gender (as a\npsychological entity and cultural role distinguished from sex) is a\nconsequence of medical technology, and in part, the emergence of\ntranssexuality. Rather than arising as a consequence of sexist gender\nroles, Hausman argues, transsexuality is one of vehicles through which\ngender itself is produced as an effect of discourses designed to\njustify access to certain medical technology (140). In defending this\nposition, Hausman points to the historical emergence of the expressions\ngender and gender identity in the work of individuals\nsuch as John Money and Robert Stoller (discussed earlier). She sees\nsuch historical developments not as moments of intellectual discovery\nbut as discursive development. It is the precisely the development of\nthis new gender discourse which ushers in gender and gender identity.\nAnd such discourse is made possible, for Hausman, through the advance\nin technology which allows surgical treatment of intersex and\ntranssexual individuals. In effect, gender and gender identity\ndiscourse emerges as a way to motivate and justify the deployment of\ncertain medical technologies. \n\nIn light of this, Hausman critiques Butler for assuming an\nahistorical use of gender/sex in her attempt to read sex as\n“gender all along.” On the contrary, argues Hausman, gender\nwas a historical development (179). Prior to gender, argues Hausman,\nthe reproductive subject (i.e., woman or man understood within a\nheterosexual framework) was understood in terms of the body as\nsignifier of sex. With the development of gender, the reproductive\nsubject (now understood in terms of heterosexual gender role) is taken\nto signify gender identity (as the very ground for biological sex)\n(187–88). Hausman resists Butler's (1990) call to proliferate\ngenders, then, and insists instead on a return to the notion of sex\n(180). \nA significant component of Hausman's account is that transsexual\nagency is inherently complicit in the medical model (140). For Hausman,\ntranssexuals are defined by their desire for surgical conversion and\nhave their subjectivity constituted by and through medical accounts of\ntranssexuality. Beyond the medical model, no transsexual subjectivity\nis possible at all, according to Hausman. Whereas Stone (1991) sought\nto disrupt the traditional transsexual narrative by making room for the\nexperiences of transsexuals (captured in “double vision”)\nand by generating new hybrid (“genre-blending”) narratives,\nHausman denies that there is anything further to be said (174).\nNotably, Hausman appears to misrepresent Stone as claiming that there\nis a single reality or truth to be told, concealed by the medical\nnarrative (146). However, she also appears to reject any possibility of\n“double consciousness” and of trans resistance to the\nmedical model (195–6). This rejection, however, is empirically false as\nis evidenced by Stone's observations about the subversive\nactivities in transsexual subculture (discussed above). Indeed, given\nthat Stone herself, a transsexual, seems capable of articulating an\naccount of self that exceeds and contests the medical model, it is\nunclear why and how Hausman can deny that resistant transsexual\nsubjectivity is possible. \nFor Hausman, transsexual autobiographies serve the function of\njustifying access to surgery through the deployment of medical\naccounts. The purpose of such narratives is to compel the reader to\ncomply with the author's experience and to interpret her own life\nin the same way (156). Indeed, Hausman argues, these very narratives\nbelie several contradictions and are actually self-defeating. For\nexample, Hausman notes a self-defeating tension between transsexual\nclaims to have always been “the other sex” all along and\nthe related demand for “sex-change” surgery (148). If one\nwas always that sex all along, then why sex-change surgery? \nIn response to this charge, Prosser (1998) argues that\nautobiographical narrative is essential to understanding transsexual\nsubjectivity (103).  In his view, autobiographical\nnarrative—required by the clinician, and then perhaps re-visited\nthrough a formal autobiography—allows transsexuals to confer\nintelligibility upon their lives.  Such accounts, Prosser points out,\nare always retrospective. And they involve a split between the\nnarrated self and the narrating self. Such tensions between claims to\nhaving always belonged to a sex (on the one hand) and of going through\na process of surgical sex-change (on the other) are simply\nconstitutive of the types of tensions that arise in autobiographical\nnarrative (1998, 114–120). \nWhether or not Prosser is correct, however, Hausman's\nidentification of self-undermining tensions is weak. A claim to have\nalways belonged to a sex and a claim to have become a sex through\nsurgery are only in tension if ‘sex’ is used univocally in\nthe two claims. But it isn't clear that this is so. If claims to\nhave always belong to a sex are used to flag a gender identity and\nperhaps the sense that one ought to have born to the other sex (on the\none hand), while claims to have changed one's sex are used to\nflag bodily transformation (on the other hand), then there scarcely\nseems to be a self-defeating tension. \nHausman also briefly considers transgender politics as a possible\nsource of resistance to the medical conception of transsexuality. She\nrecognizes that the possibility of trans people working in a way that\nis at odds with the medical regulation of gender is at odds with her\nattempt to reduce transsexual subjectivity to complicity. In reply,\nhowever, Hausman sides with Raymond in affirming that the sheer mix-and-match of\ngender presentation does nothing to transcend gender, relying on an\nunacceptable view of gender as in some ways voluntary (197–8). She also\nnotes that Bornstein (whom she sees as representative of all current\ntransgender politics) continues to make room for transsexual identities\nand transsexual surgery, which she sees as fundamentally problematic\n(198). Even if Hausman is right that some transgender activists adopt\nthis position about transsexuals, however, she hasn't fully\naddressed the main point that there exist forms of trans subjectivity\nwhich outstrip the medical model. And while she is certainly right that\nnot all gender blending is subversive, it isn't clear why none\nis. \nOne of the notable outcomes of Hausman's work (as well as\nRaymond's new introduction to The Transsexual Empire),\nwas a heightened recognition among trans scholars of the fragility of\ntransgender studies. Concerned by the continuing transphobia inherent\nin some non trans feminist writers, C. Jacob Hale drafted\n“Suggested Rules for Non-Transsexuals Writing about\nTranssexuality, Transsexualism, or Trans” (1997) to assist\nnon-trans individuals in writing about trans people in ways that\navoided, rather than perpetuated, transphobic strategies and\nrepresentations. \nTo a large extent, (non-trans) feminist discussion of trans issues\nseems to have circulated around the perceived problematic status of\ntrans people (and, in particular, transsexuals). Moreover, there has\ngenerally been an over-emphasis on MTFs in particular. So it is worth\ndrawing attention to significant (trans) feminist views which have\nemerged from disputes in subaltern communities among various non-gender\nnormative individuals, particularly those assigned female at birth. \nTensions among FTM-identified and butch lesbian-identified people had\nbeen leading to politically charged disputes about the significance of\nmasculinity. For some lesbians, FTMs represented a betrayal of\nwomanhood and a desertion of lesbian community. For some FTMs, butch\nmasculinity was a lesser and perhaps “artificial”\nmanifestation of masculinity in contrast to the masculinity exemplified\nby FTMs. Such competing ways of understanding masculinity led to what\nhave sometimes been called “Butch/FTM border wars”\n(Halberstam and Hale, 1998). \nSuch conflict found articulation in a dispute over the gender identity\nand sexual orientation of a young masculine-presenting\nfemale-assigned-at birth individual, Brandon (Teena), who was slain in\nHumbolt, Nebraska in 1993, when discovered to be “really a\nwoman.” (Hale [1998a] argues that there is not good evidence that\nBrandon used the name Brandon Teena. It has, however, become a\ncommon way of referring to this individual. I place the name\nTeena in parentheses to flag the problematic nature of this\nlinguistic construction). An article in the Village Voice, by\nDonna Minkowitz entitled “Love Hurts. Brandon Teena Was a Woman\nWho Lived and Loved as a Man. She was Killed for Carrying It\nOff”, led to the formation of Transexual Menace, a trans activist\ngroup, which protested the perceived invalidation of Brandon's\nidentity as transgender person (Prosser 1997, 316). \nSimilar tensions arose in the academic literature. Judith\nHalberstam's ground-breaking essay “F2M: The Making of\nFemale Masculinity” (1994) was the target of considerable\ncriticism from within FTM communities (Halberstam 1998a). Jay\nProsser's “No Place Like Home: The Transgendered Narrative\nof Leslie Feinberg's Stone Butch Blues” (1995)\naimed to offer an academic reply to Halberstam's perceived\ninvalidation of FTM self-identities. \nIn “F2M” Halberstam seeks to undercut the representation of\nFTM transition as a more radical form of gender crossing than others\n(such as lesbian butch gender presentation) (1994, 212; 1998a, 289).\nShe points to the failure of the standard scheme (straight/ lesbian/\ntranssexual) in accounting for the multiple and highly specific forms\nof identity and desire in “postmodern lesbian identities.”\nShe argues against the notion of crossing from one category to another\nin light of the proliferation of such identities situated at alleged\n“crossings” (1994, 212). By this she means that such\nidentities can be taken in their own right as claiming ways of being in\nthe world that contest the very dominant categories that would situate\nthem as “crossings.” \nHalberstam claims that surgical intervention in the case of\n“sex-change” serves to “fictionalize” gender\n(i.e., render or expose as artificial) (1994, 216). Likewise, she\nargues, alternative gender presentations involving attire or fantasy\ncan “fictionalize” gender, where in all cases the\n“fiction” requires a reader (221). These\n“fictions” may play a significant role in the identities\nand desire of individuals. The upshot is that there is nothing\ndistinctive about FTM transsexuality in “fictionalizing”\ngender. Rather a masculine performing butch lesbian, for example,\nlikewise fictionalizes it. “Sex-change” and\n“cross-dressing” are largely on a par with regard to their\ncentral importance to identity and desire. \nIn light of this move, Halberstam notoriously remarks, “We are\nall transsexuals. There are no transsexuals” (1994, 212) in order\nto underline the plurality of ways in which gender (as identity and\ndesire central) can be “fictionalized.” This attempt to\nundercut the specificity of FTM transsexuality drew fire from some FTM\ncircles and Halberstam later weakened her claim (1998a, 306). Her\npoint, however, (as she later explained), was to mark out space for the\nnotion of a transgender butch as a position which resisted a\ncontinuum in which lesbian butch masculinity is represented as less\nthan the fully achieved masculinity of FTM transsexuals (1998a,\n289). \n\nIn his reply to Halberstam, Prosser contrasts what he sees as the\noppositional positions of queer and trans. He takes issue with a\ntendency in queer theory to represent gender/sex as performance and, in\nHalberstam's work, fictions. (As has been noted, for some trans\npeople, the view that gender is unreal or artificial seems to undo\ntheir very attempts to see themselves as “real men” or\n“real women”). Yet, while there may be some grounds for\nsome political complaint with this theoretical account, Prosser falls\nprey to a view which holds butch lesbian masculine presentation as\nmerely artificial or gender play, in contrast with the\n“reality” and “depth” present in the case of\nFTMs. In this way, he does not sufficiently differentiate between lived\nlives that may (or may not) be described as “queer” (e.g.\nbutch masculinities) and an academic queer/postmodern theoretical\nstarting point (1995, 487). The latter may very well involve viewing\nall gender as performance and identity as fictional. However,\n“queer” lives (involving butch masculinities) need not be\nviewed this way. To distinguish butch as artificial and transsexual as\nreal is to refuse to acknowledge the relationship of many butch\nindividuals to gender and identity. \nProsser's strategy for marking a trans theoretical vantage point\nis to draw a contrast between the centrality of performance (in queer\ntheory) and narrative (for transsexual people). He correctly notes a\ntendency in postmodern queer theory to raise questions about the\npolitical role of narratives (1995, 484). Such narratives may be seen\nto involve the illusion of a false unity and they may also involve\nexclusionary politics. Yet narratives, according to Prosser, are\ncentral to the accounts of transsexuals and such narratives involve the\nnotion of home and belonging (1995, 488). This appeal to narrative\nseems in tension with a picture which underscores the fragmentation of\ncoherent narratives into diverse performances and which identifies\nsubversion with the disruption of narrative-based identities. Coherent\nnarratives, even if ultimately fictional, play important\nintelligibility-conferring roles in the lives of transsexuals,\naccording to Prosser. And this cannot be well-accommodated in accounts\nwhich aim to undermine such coherence. \nIn Prosser's view, transsexual narratives are driven by a sense\nof feeling not at home in one's body, through a journey of\nsurgical change, ultimately culminating in a coming home to oneself\n(and one's body) (1995, 490). In this way, the body and bodily\ndiscomfort constitute the “depth” or “reality”\nthat stands in contrast to the view that body is sexed through\nperformative gender behavior which constitutes it as the container of\ngender identity. In light of this, Prosser concludes that queer\ntheory's use of transsexuals to undermine gender as mere\nperformance fails to do justice to the importance of narrative and\nbelonging in trans identities. \nDrawing on Feinberg's Stone Butch Blues, Prosser argues\nthat transgender (construed as a departure from traditional\ntranssexuality) likewise involves a narrative structure. In this case,\nhowever, the narrative involves making a home of the in-between space\nbetween man and woman (1995, 500). Since, however, it involves more\nthan mere performance (i.e., dysphoria concerning one's body) as\nwell as the centrality of narrative, it ought to be distinguished from\ngeneric understandings of queer. He later alters his view slightly,\nplacing transgender in a liminal space between queer and transsexual,\nadmitting far more ambivalence around the notion of home and belonging\n(1998, 177). \nWhile Prosser may be right to emphasize the importance of narratives in\nthe identities of transsexual and transgender people, however, it is\nhardly clear that he can maintain the fairly sharp lines he hopes to\ndraw between transsexual, transgender, and queer. The narrative\nstructure of identity (as well as notions of home and belonging) may be\nimportant for many people (including queer-identified ones). And, while\nfor Prosser what is distinctive about transsexual/transgender\nnarratives is that they involve a feeling of bodily unbelonging, it\nisn't clear why such dysphoria may not be present among non\ntrans-identified people. Moreover, his view seems to take for granted\nthe view that for trans people there is always a “home” to\nwhich one might return (or, at least, imagine). Yet this is to assume\nthat trans people have the means by which to find this belonging (in\ntheir bodies, etc.). Given economic realities, however, this is far\nfrom clear. Indeed, given the meagerness of linguistic resources to\neven explain trans experiences, it isn't obvious how, in some\ncases, so much as an imaginary home might be formulated. \nThe work of C. Jacob Hale is a kind of philosophical intervention in\nthese borderland disputes. He offers one of the earliest theorizations\nof trans issues from within the analytic tradition. And in some ways,\nhis perspective welds together trans, queer, and feminist sensibilities\nfrom a distinctive queer, feminist, ftm vantage point. (Hale uses the\nterm ftm rather than FTM as a way to refuse the term as an\nabbreviation of female-to-male. Instead, for Hale, it is a\ncommunity-specific term. This discussion of Hale will respect his\nterminological decisions). His work centers around the analysis of\ngender categories. \nHale (1996) examines Monique Wittig's (1992) contentious claim\nthat lesbians are not women. (Wittig's point was to turn on its\nhead the heterosexist view that lesbians fail to count as women by\narguing that lesbians step outside the oppressive category of woman\nwhich requires heterosexual relations with men). Hale is one of the\nfirst to defend the view (now adopted by many feminist philosophers)\nthat the category woman is what Wittgenstein called a\nfamily-resemblance concept. The concept woman, in Hale's\nview, has thirteen, differently weighted characteristics none of which\nare necessary or sufficient for category membership (1996, 107–12).\nThis position enables Hale to then argue, pace Wittig, that some\nlesbians are women, others are not, and for some there is no fact of\nthe matter (1996, 115). \nIn Hale's view, the category woman is inherently normative (1996,\n104). Individuals who fall within it can be assessed on the degree to\nwhich they conform to the thirteen characteristics. For Hale, the\ncategory is governed by both positive and negative exemplars. Negative\nexemplars serve to proscribe certain forms of behavior and threaten the\npossibility of falling out of the category altogether (1996, 105). Yet\nwhile the threat of falling outside of the category must be in place to\nregulate conduct, owing to the cultural requirements of preserving the\nprevailing common sense about gender, very few individuals must\nactually fall outside of the category altogether (105–6). \nSimilarly, Hale argues, there is no single feature which can\ndistinguish between butch and ftm individuals (except, perhaps, the\nsheer self-identification with the very labels butch or\nftm). Not all ftms self-identify as men and not all\nbutches self-identify as women, some butches identify more strongly\nwith masculinity than do some ftms, and some butches avail themselves\nof body-altering medical technologies, while some ftms do not (1998a,\n321–2). Hale also critiques “desire for a penis” as the\ndividing line between butches and ftms (199a, 326–30): Such an attempt\nerases complex butch desires as well as the idiosyncratic relationship\nof ftms to their bodies while accounting for butch/ftm distinctions in\na phallocentric way. Additionally, it draws on a model of\n“sex-change surgery” which is borrowed from male-to-female\ncontexts (in which “the surgery” is identified with genital\nsurgery) and thereby further promotes male-to-female dominance in trans\ncontexts (329–30). By this Hale means that “the surgery” is\ntypically used to refer to genital reconstruction surgery. However the\ncentralization of one surgery is especially problematic in ftm\ncontexts. Double mastectomy and hysterectomy are other important\nsurgeries. Indeed, “top surgery” (as it is sometimes\ncalled) often figures more prominently in ftm contexts. \nInstead, Hale suggests that both categories would be better analyzed\nas family-resemblance concepts (1998a, 323). If so, claims Hale, it\nwould be better to speak of a border zone where the categories\npartially overlap with each other than to search for a firm boundary\nbetween the two (323). The model allows Hale to, perhaps in the spirit\nof Anzaldúa, speak of “border zone\ndwellers”—individuals who live at the edges of multiple,\noverlapping identity categories. He argues that given the evidence,\nBrandon (Teena) appears to have been such a border zone dweller\n(317–9). Attempts to claim the dead (or the living) who live in such\nborder zones, argues Hale, make it even harder for such individuals to\nlive there (319). It makes it more difficult to live there by\nthreatening to eliminate border zone space altogether by trying to\nforce individuals who occupy it into other frameworks. Similarly,\nborder zone dwellers may face pressure to claim identity categories\nthat do not work well and which threaten to erase the specifics of\ntheir lived experiences (336). Such subject positions (constituted by\na lack of any central identity category) are important, albeit\ndifficult place to speak from (partially because there doesn't\nseem to be any available language). Yet such specificity must be\nmaintained, argues Hale, partially through calling into question the\nfunction of definitions and categories, partially through artistic\nendeavor that attempts to creatively give voice to experiences not\nwell captured in the available language (336–7). Hale strongly urges\nthat butch/ftm border zones be “demilitarized” (i.e., that\ndifferent “camps” such as ftm community and lesbian\ncommunity stop trying to claim border zone dwellers as their own)\nin order to make room for marginalized border zone dwellers themselves\n(340). \nHale expands on his notion of the border zone dweller in order to\noutline what it might be to articulate an ftm feminist voice (1998b).\nHe draws principally on María Lugones' notion of\n‘world’-travelling (Lugones 1987). In her view, those\nmarginalized by the mainstream may occupy different\n‘worlds’ in which they may be constructed as different\npersons. (A shift in self, for Lugones, constitutes a shift in\n‘world’). For Hale, then, border zone dwellers, those who\noccupy ‘dislocated locations,’ may fit within different\ncategories (‘man’, ‘ftm’, ‘butch’,\n‘genderqueer’ etc.) that attach to different cultural\n‘worlds’ (1998b, 116–7). However, since these border zone\ndwellers are marginal with respect to the categories, their fit in all\ncases will be only limited and tenuous. In this way, Hale modifies\nLugones' conception of ‘world’-travel (which does not\npostulate such a tenuous fit into categories) (117). By contrast,\nLugones' conception insists upon the multiplicity of languages\nand systems of meaning, which is de-emphasized in Hale's\nmodel. \n\nHale argues that because many ftms have had experiences living as girls\nor women, have a history of moving in feminist ‘worlds’,\nand may be far more aware of the significance of masculine enactments,\nthere is a strong basis for wanting to avoid certain forms of\nmasculinity while embracing those which abide by feminist values\n(1998b, 118). This requires, according to Hale, maintaining human bonds\nwith non-trans feminist women and travelling to their\n“worlds” while continuing to recognize oneself as a border\ndweller. This is difficult, however, given assumptions by non-trans\nfeminists who do not have the experience of certain forms of gender\noppression (such as transphobia) (118). \nIt also requires caution with respect to the types of identifications\none makes. For Hale, identification as a member of a category\ninvolves both identifications with members of that group as\nwell as identifications as not-members of some other category\n(119). There may be pressure, through uptake of the category ftm, for\nexample, to identify primarily with non-trans men and to dis-identify\nwith butch lesbians. Such pressure, for Hale must be avoided (119).\nIdentification with may operate independently of\nidentification as a member of category (on the basis of, for\nexample, historical ties). The making of such identifications must be\nguided by the exercise of moral and political agency. In light of this,\nHale argues, gendered self-identities must be made secondary to moral\nand political identifications (120). \nAfter Butler, there have been notable non-trans feminist contributions\nto the study of trans issues, focusing largely on the issue of feminist\nsolidarity and trans identities. In marked contrast to the works of\nRaymond and Hausman, these contributions constitute sincere efforts at\npromoting trans and non-trans feminist coalition. \nNaomi Scheman (1997) examines the ways in which certain dominant forms\nof normativity necessitate “abjected others” who are\nrequired but rendered impossible and unintelligible to normatively\nprivileged selves. Scheman rejects the options of either claiming a\nplace at the center of normalized forms of life (from which one has\ninitially been excluded), or refusing to engage the dominant forms of\nidentity at all (by accepting one's “marginal”\nstatus). Instead, Scheman aims to contest the normative center by\ncentralizing those who have been marginalized (126–7). With this in\nmind, she begins with the assumption that marginalized lives “are\nlived, and hence livable” (132). \nScheman draws on her own lack of clarity about Jewish identity, as a\nsecular Jew, in order to help trouble the unproblematic status of her\nown gender. She sees a Jewish people conceptually required by\nChristianormativity, and yet rendered unintelligible by its\nrepresentation of all religions as entirely conversion-based (1997,\n128). Under such conditions, it becomes hard to explain what it is to\nidentify as a secular Jew. Likewise, she sees transsexuality as\ninvolving a required incoherence. Since heteronormativity requires a\n“natural” binary of women and men, transsexuals are\nparadoxically defined by an insistence of having always been the other\nsex all along and thereby required to deny their own histories (as\nStone argues) (138–9). In this respect, Scheman notes,\nChristianormativity and heteronormativity are contrasting: The former\nrepresents all religions as driven by choice and conversion, the latter\nrepresents all gender as naturally determined at birth (142). \nBoth “Jewishness” and “womanhood” for Scheman,\ncan be understood as family-resemblance concepts (1997, 144). However\nthose who have been assigned to the category Jew on the basis\nof ancestry or to a gender on the basis of birth form the basis of such\nconcepts without which the concepts would not exist at all (144). She\nintroduces the expression “perinatally pinked” to describe\nthose individuals who have experienced oppression as female from birth\nand recommends it as a way to understand the need for\n“womyn-born-womyn” space which she sees as intended for\nhealing the damage inflicted through natal assignment as a female in a\nmisogynist society (141–2). \nYet just as individuals may convert to Judaism and become a Jew,\nScheman suggests, MTFs may be understood to “convert” to\nwomanhood. In both cases, such individuals are no less real than those\nwho have been assigned the categories at birth (144). While she notes\nseveral disanalogies (e.g., in the case of transsexuality one does not\nsimply choose, as one might convert to a religion), she also\nsuggests that by viewing sex/gender as more analogous to Jewishness in\nthis respect, some of its oppressiveness might be undermined (145). The\nnotion of joining a collectivity is important, for Scheman, because it\nstresses the importance of shared bonds, values, and commitments. In\nthe end, this is what is most important, she argues: “The issue,\nthen, is not who is or is not really whatever but who can be counted on\nwhen they come for any one of us: The solid ground is not identity but\nloyalty and solidarity” (153). \nCressida Heyes continues this non-trans feminist project of finding\ngrounds for solidarity between (non trans) feminists and trans folk.\nFollowing Hale, she argues that woman is a family-resemblance\nconcept, regulated in different ways for different political purposes\n(2000, 84–5). And following Scheman, she notes that in some cases\ndifferences between trans and non-trans women (such as being\n“perinatally pinked”) may need to be emphasized for\npolitical purposes (93). She offers a critique of the non-trans\nfeminist positions of Raymond and Hausman, while also critiquing what\nshe sees as troubling tendencies in some transgender politics (such as\nthe work of Leslie Feinberg) to adopt a liberal conception of the self\nas atomistic (2003). In this way, she seeks to find some middle, common\nground. \nHeyes argues that both Raymond and Hausman are caught in the grip of a\npicture which precludes any examination of their own gender privilege\nwhile foreclosing the possibility of perceiving trans resistance (2003,\n1095). This foreclosure is accomplished through assimilating all\ntranssexual subjectivity into to a hetero-patriarchal medical discourse\nabout transsexuality (2003, 1095). Using Feinberg's book\nTrans Liberation as an example, Heyes also raises worries\nabout a transgender politics which says that individual gender\nexpression ought not be subject to criticism, restriction, or\noppression. She observes that gender is not merely an aesthetic style\nor expression of an isolated self. It is relational and often embedded\nin problematic systems of oppression. This means that forms of\nmasculinity involve interacting with women, for example, in particular\nways. Certain forms of masculinity involve misogyny. What it means to\nbe a “real man” may involve relating to women in\nhostile, destructive ways. Such gender behavior ought to be\ncritiqued. What is missing from accounts which merely tout gender\nfreedom of expression, Heyes argues, is a rich “ethics of\ntransformation” which distinguishes between progressive\ntransformations from those who are oppressed and marginalized and\nhegemonic (i.e., dominant; oppressive) forms of gender that only\nfurther oppression and marginalization (2003, 1111–3). \nHeyes also examines the use of sex/race analogy in questions about\ntranssexuality and a hypothetical “transracialism.” Recall\nRaymond's rhetorical question “Does a Black person who\nwants to be white suffer from the ‘disease’ of being a\n‘transracial?’” Such a question is intended to show\nthat, since “transracialism” is politically and morally\nsuspect, so too, is transsexuality. Christine Overall, by contrast,\nargues the inverse of what Raymond claims, namely that those who accept\nthe morality of transsexuality ought to accept the morality of\n“transracialism” as well (2004). \nHeyes observes that Raymond's claim that “there is no\ndemand for transracial medical intervention precisely because most\nBlacks recognize that it is their society, not their skin, that needs\nchanging” [1994, xvi] is actually empirically false (2003, 1102).\nCosmetic procedures do exist which aim to modify ethnically or\nracially marked features (e.g. hair-straightening treatments,\nnose-jobs, eye-lid surgery). Heyes points to Raymond's use of a\nsex/race analogy to dismiss transsexuals as “capricious or\nappropriative” (2006, 269). The analogy is used, Heyes claims, as\na basis for assessing the motivations and politics of individuals who\nchange identity in a way that problematically assumes that such\nmotivations may be based on a “transparent political evaluation\nof its benefits and drawbacks” (ibid.). \nWhile Overall offers a far more nuanced analysis, claims Heyes, she\nstill treats race and sex in a way that is abstracted from the\nhistorical conditions and assumes that such history is irrelevant to\nethical assessment (2006, 269–70). In particular, Heyes argues that in\ndrawing analogies between race and sex there is a danger in not paying\nsufficient attention to the contrasting histories of race and sex. For\nexample, since sex has been viewed as a core ontological fact in a\nbinary scheme, the conditions are in place for the possibility of\nsex-change as well as medicalized transsexual discourse which\nreinscribes this basic, ontological binary (2003, 1102; 2006, 2006,\n277). By contrast, while race has also been viewed as a natural\ncategory, there is another racial discourse which understands it as a\nsuperficial feature under which human beings are all the same. This,\nalong with the lack of the same strict binary, does not provide the\nsame conditions which would make “transracialism” a similar\npossibility (2003, 1103). \nHeyes points to the historical role played by heredity in determining\nrace (but not sex). This mitigates against the possibility of\n“transracialism” in a way that is not present in the case\nof sex, she argues (2006, 271). Relatedly, changing race has a history\nof being associated with “passing” which would leave any\n“transracialist” subject to accusations of\n“passing” in a way that is not present in the case of\nsexual crossing (272). Heyes notes, then, that those promoting cosmetic\nprocedures which change ethnic or racial features take care to avoid\nissues around racial betrayal by emphasizing individual self-expression\nand aesthetics (273–4). By contrast, argues Heyes, since sex is not\nviewed as hereditary, the possible of sex-change has been more viable.\nIndeed, contemporary sex must be understood as partially constituted by\nthe history of technological developments in sex modification (as\n“passing” has partially constituted race) that has\nprecisely allowed for such sex-change within the discourse of\npathology and internal gender identity (277). \n\nIn considering the metaphysics of sex/gender transition\n(i.e. transition from man to woman or woman to man), Christine Overall\n(2009), critiques two accounts of it. Both accounts agree that, in a\nway, there is no change of sex/gender at all. One remains the\nsex/gender one always was. She calls both of these “masquerade\nhypotheses” (12). In the first version, adopted usually by (some)\nnontrans people, the trans person who transitions from one sex/gender\nto another is merely donning a mask or engaging in a pretense that\neffectively hides what they always really were (the “true\nperson”). In such a view, the trans person is represented as\neither deceptive or deluded. In the second version, adopted usually by\n(some) trans people, the trans person who transitions is merely\nbecoming what they always already were, through pulling off a kind of\nbodily mask which fails to express what they are “on the\ninside” (the “true person”). In both accounts,\nsex/gender is invariant. Rather than changing sex/gender, one either\nmoves into the state of masquerade or out of it. Overall argues that\nboth the delusion and deception are implausibly applied to the diverse\nlives of all trans people and, indeed, belied by the lives of many\ntrans people (13-14). She rejects the second masquerade account on the\ngrounds that it relies on a suspect metaphysics (14-18). \n\nIn Overall's view, by contrast, we ought to understand sex/gender\ntransition as analogous to “other life-changing and\nlife-enhancing aspirations for personal transformation and\nself-realization” (19). Some of the examples she gives include\nbecoming an immigrant; joining a twelve-step program to give up\nalcohol, joining a religion, becoming a mother. “Some goals and\naspirations,” Overall writes, “are deeply felt and of\ncentral value to particular individuals, and it is those goals and\naspirations that provide the dominant drives of the individual”\n(19).  In place of both masquerade views, she proposes that we view\nsex/gender transition as an actual change in sex/gender. What remains\nconstant is not some reified gendered self. Instead, the person\n“persists insofar as her way of being, after transition, is\ndesired and actively sought by her previous self, so that the way of\nbeing after the transition grows out of the previous self, is\ngenerated by the previous self, and can be understood in terms of\ncharacteristics of the previous self” (20). \n\nOne unfortunate consequence of this view is that a trans man (for\nexample) cannot truthfully claim to be a man prior to\ntransitioning. To be sure, there is a sense in which being a man is a\ncore part of his identity both prior to transition and afterwards,\nsince becoming a man is a life-changing aspiration subsequently\nrealized. Her account is therefore importantly different from the\nfirst masquerade account in that it takes seriously trans identities,\nviewing them as striving for a kind of authenticity. But his claim to\nbe a man (or male) prior to transitioning is still false. To see this\nmore clearly consider that insofar as Overall (2009) effectively\ndefines sex in terms of genitalia (11), it follows that a trans man\nwho has not undergone phalloplasty has not yet changed his sex (and is\nstill therefore female, and possibly still a woman). The problem is\nthat, in part owing to its cost, many trans men elect not to have this\ntype of surgery. Nonetheless, they may still regard themselves as men\n(and even male). This leaves open the possibility for the charge of\nself-delusion or self-deception to re-emerge despite Overall's attempt\nto avoid this. \n\nOverall (2012) uses her conception of gender/sex\ntransition as aspirational, to undermine the view that trans and\ncisgender people are very different from each other. Her goal in doing\nthis is not to elide the forms of violence and discrimination to which\ntrans people are subject as trans, but to call into question the view\nthat being cisgender is normal, while being trans is deviant\n(252-3). \n\nShe distinguishes between acquired and aspirational identities. The\nfirst are assigned or earned in such a way that no further work is\nrequired to maintain them (255). For example, being a biological\nmother is an acquired identity. Aspirational identity, by contrast,\nrequires constant work to maintain (256). For example, being a mother\n(as in a caregiver for one or more children) requires constant\nmaintenance. Overall argues that gender identity (by which she means\nthe social categories boy/man and girl/woman) is aspirational in\nnature. “One can aspire to exemplify a gender through the\naforementioned bodily styling, self-presentation, and gendered\nactivities, all of which must be ongoing for gender identity\nmaintenance” (256-57). She also argues that sex itself may be\nbecoming an aspirational identity (at least for some) insofar as both\ncis and trans people alike seek out surgery and other medical\nprocedures (e.g. hormone therapy) to alter or augment the sexual\ncharacteristics of their bodies (258). \n\nOverall then argues that trans and cis people have the following\nfeatures in common (with regard to aspirational identity). Both are\nimmersed in a system of compulsory gender maintenance, both are\nsubject to constraints on how their gender identities are maintained\nwhile also afforded various opportunities to express their identities,\nboth are subject to various dangers connected to gender maintenance\n(e.g., trans people can be subject to transphobic violence for\n“misrepresenting” their genital status, while cis women may\nbe subject to violence on the basis of their gender presentation),\nfinally (and contrary to a common assumption) both may experience\nforms of continuity and discontinuity in their gender aspirations. For\nexample, a trans person may harbor gender aspirations of being a\ngirl/woman for most of their life, while a cis woman may, as a\nconsequence of feminism, alter her womanly aspirations. In this way,\nOverall continues this non-trans feminist project of finding grounds\nfor solidarity between non-trans feminists and trans people.  Gayle Salamon's work (2010) concerns the phenomenology of gendered\nembodiment and, in particular, trans experiences of dissonance between\n“felt body” and the external appearance of the body. She\nrevisits the dispute between Judith Butler (who claims that the\ngendered self is socially-constructed) and trans theorists, such as\nJay Prosser (1998) who, rather than taking transsexuality as evidence\nof the constructedness of gender, points to it as evidence of\nsomething that transcends such construction (1998, 7 and 65). Aside\nfrom arguing that Prosser misreads both Freud and Didier Anzieu (2010,\n39-40), Salamon defends the implausibility of viewing proprioceptive\nawareness of the body as somehow culturally-transcendent. She argues\nthat the body postulated in such a view is ultimately unrecognizable\nas human (88). In her view, “the same social forces that\nconstitute a body as culturally legible or illegible also shape the\nvery feelings of embodiment that would seem to be most personal, most\nindividual, and most immune to regulatory injunction” (77).  Drawing on the work of Schilder (1950), Salamon sees one’s body\nimage as not innate, but as built up over time through experiential\ncontact with the world (including interactions with other people).  In\nlight of this, Salamon argues that the lack of fit between felt sense\nof body and external appearance of the body experienced by some trans\npeople is, in fact, pervasive - relevant to trans and non-trans folk\nalike: “The production of normative gender itself,” she\nwrites, “relies on a disjunction between the 'felt sense' of the\nbody and the body's corporeal contours and . . . this disjunction need\nnot be viewed as a pathological structure” (2010, 2).  Yet it is not clear how such an environmental account can explain\nthe genesis of trans experiences of “wrong”\nembodiment. Consider that not all trans women possess a conscious\nself-identity of being a woman (or a girl) from a very early age, and\nnot all trans men possess a conscious self-identity of being a man (or\nboy) from early on. Imagine, then a trans woman who is raised to see\nherself as male and to follow “the proper” gender\nnorms. This person should, in the environmental account, develop a\nbody image that would be described as roughly 'male.' For in\naccordance with external gender norms and internalized gender\nidentity, this person will have generally had the types of interactive\nworldly-experiences that would be expected to yield such an\nimage. Thus, if there's such an image that's incongruent with assigned\ngender, it mustn't have been developed in that environmental way.  In addition to possessing an internal perception of one's body,\nhowever, one is also affectively invested in one's body. That is, one\ntakes an interest in it and has strong emotions about it.  Salamon\nwrites, “Without that investment, our relationship to our bodies\nis one of depersonalized estrangement: my sense of the\n”mine-ness“ of my own body-and, crucially, even my sense\nof its coherence-depends on this narcissistic investment” (2010,\n42). This provides a way to move beyond the limitations of\n(socially-regulated) environmental experience insofar as such\naffective attitudes are not subject to the same type of\nworldly-constraint. \n\nThe challenge, however, is to explain this investment in such a way\nthat does not reduce to sexuality or forms of eroticism. Expressions\nsuch as Schilder's libinal investment have strong sexual\nconnotations. And the worry is that an appeal to such notions will\nreduce trans experiences of bodily dsyphoria to sexual\nfeelings. This is of particular concern in light of the long\nstanding tendency (as Salamon notes, 2010, 45) to construe\ntranssexuality in terms of sexual desire, to reduce cross-gender\nidentification to a kind of sexual fetish, and to elide trans gender\nbody dysphoria as a discrete phenomenon. Unfortunately in her\ndiscussion of this issue, Salamon appeals to Butler's notion of the\nmorphological imaginary which itself actually does appear to privilege\nthe sexual.  What remains to be explained - a serious lacuna - is the\nnon-sexual affective investment in the gendered body that presumably\nmust ground the disjunction between felt sense of gendered body and\nthe visual body in cases of trans bodily dysphoria.  \n\nIn her own account of sexual desire, however, Salamon is notably\ncareful to avoid reducing transsexuality to eroticism. She is merely\ninterested instead, in accommodating trans experiences of sexuality in\na way that is not invalidating (2010, 45). Salamon draws on\nMerleau-Ponty's notions of the sexual schema and transposition.  In\nexperiencing sexual desire, one is oriented toward an object of\ndesire. In transposition, one's body (that “houses”) the\nsexual desire comes to be replaced by (or itself actually becomes) the\ndesire itself.  Salamon illustrates the point as follows. When I'm\nthirsty and reach for a glass of water, “my arm, unbent and\nreaching out, is no longer the location of my sensation but rather\nbecomes the gesture through which I am toward the other. The arm is\nthe conduit of desire, but not the seat of its sensation”\n(54). \n\nIn Salamon's account, what's important is not the actual body part\nitself, but its role in sexual desire, and this process of\ntransposition: “The join between desire and the body is the\nlocation of sexuality, and that join may be a penis, or some other\nphallus, or some other body part, or a region of the body that is not\nindividuated into a part, or a bodily auxiliary that is not\norganically attached to the body” (2010, 51). In this way,\nSalamon's appeal to Merleau-Ponty is similar to Butler's notion of the\nmorphological imaginary with respect to the role of the erotic in\nincorporating the part through a form of sexuality (or, actually, the\nwhole way of being toward another). Notably, however, Salamon's\naccount allows her to show how one's “internal sense of\ngender” can become capable of being witnessed by others in the\nworld. For rather than talking merely about an internal feeling, we\nare talking about ways of being in the world, in interaction with\nothers. \n\nMany trans women, because they are women, are well acquainted\nwith mechanisms of sexism and sexual violence. Moreover, sometimes\nsexism and transphobia can be blended together inseparably.  For\nexample, some trans women may sometimes find that they are\nstereotypically represented as prostitutes simply because they are\nseen as transgender women. With such considerations in mind,\na trans feminist stance might involve taking the oppression of trans\nwomen as its starting point. Several writers have outlined\ndistinctive “trans feminist” positions. \n\nEmi Koyama defines transfeminism as “primarily a movement by and\nfor trans women who view their liberation to be intrinsically linked\nto the liberation of all women and beyond” (2003, 244).  For\nKoyama, transfeminism “stands up for trans and non-trans women\nalike, and asks non-trans women to stand up for trans-women in\nreturn”, thereby embracing feminist coalition politics (ibid.).\nSome of the issues of transfeminist concern, for Koyama, include body\nimage, violence against women, and health and reproductive choice. \n\nKoyama deepens the discussion of the tensions, identified by Heyes,\nbetween freedom of gender expression (on the one hand) and concerns\nabout the political implications of gender understood as relational\n(on the other). While Koyama calls trans women to avoid the uptake of\nsexist forms of gender as well as refusing any traditional appeal to\nan essentializing gender identity, she also recognizes that trans\nwomen can find themselves in situations in which uptake of traditional\nforms of gender are necessary to secure access to medical\ntechnologies, legitimation as “real women”, and avoidance\nof transphobic violence through passing (as non-trans) (2003). She\nraises worries about the purist demand that a trans woman\neradicate all gender stereotypes in a society in which such\nstereotypes pervade. She insists instead on the priority of larger\nscale coalitional politics, leaving individual women to make their own\npersonal decisions about how to negotiate gender, free of judgments\nabout who does and does not count as a feminist (2003). \n\nKoyama also takes up the issues of trans exclusion in the\n“womyn-born womyn” policy of the Michigan Womyn's Music\nFestival. Koyama criticizes the efforts of some post-operative trans\nwomen to accept a “compromise” policy which would have\nadmitted only post-operative trans women. Such a policy, argues\nKoyama, would unfairly advantage those trans women with greater\neconomic resources, and is consequently both classist and racist\n(2006, 700). Koyama also argues that even if it is true that non-trans\nwomen require their own space, this does not preclude the admission of\ntrans women into the festival, since while women of color have special\nexclusionary space on the land, this does not require that white women\ncannot enter the festival at all (701). Moreover, Koyama points out,\nsuch special space for women of color does not exclude those women of\ncolor who can pass as white (and thereby receive certain privileges)\n(701). Indeed, Koyama argues, the exclusion of trans women is\ninherently racist insofar as it is uses differences in experience to\nrule out trans women, a policy which can only make sense if it is\npresupposed that feminist solidarity requires a monolithically shared\nexperience (704). \n\nAnother version of trans feminist politics has been elaborated by\nJulia Serano who distinguishes between traditional sexism (which she\nsees as the belief that males and masculinity are superior to females\nand femininity) and oppositional sexism (which she sees as the belief\nthat male and female, along with masculinity and femininity,\nconstitute exclusive categories) (2007, 12–3). Serano coins the\nexpression trans-misogyny to capture forms of discrimination\nwhich pertain specifically to trans women which principally target\ntheir perceived femininity (13). For example, Serano points to ways in\nwhich some trans women are represented in the media as either sexually\npredatory deceivers or pathetic, laughable, fakes (36). In Serano's\nview, such representations derive largely from a sexist focus on the\nfeminine presentation of trans women and the tendency to view\nfemininity as artificial (43–44). Serano also provocatively\nargues that the devaluation of feminine males is a distinctive form of\ntraditional sexism which she calls “effemimania” (129,\n287). \n\nSerano posits the existence of a “subconscious sex” to\ncapture the traditional notion of gender identity without requiring an\ninitial conscious awareness of “wrong body” which she\nsuggests is biologically grounded and largely limited to body rather\nthan social role (78–82). (In this way, her notion echoes\nProsser's appeal to “body ego.”) Serano deploys the\nterm cissexualism to indicate the advantaging of those for\nwhom biological sex and subconscious sex are in alignment. The term\ncisgenderism, by contrast, indicates the assumption that males\nought to be masculine and females ought to be feminine (where\nmasculinity and femininity are constituted by the set of attributes\ntypically associated with males and females respectively) (90). Serano\ntakes the position that while some forms of femininity may be socially\ninstituted, many feminine attributes may also be biologically grounded.\nShe writes: \n\nThere is a worry, however, about Serano's under-estimation of the\ndegree and depth of female subordination as well as her theoretical\nfailure to distinguish between “personal resonance” and\nenforced social acquiescence. In Serano's view, many (non-trans)\nfeminists have engaged in negative assessments of femininity (viewing\nit as strictly an imposed artifice) and thereby implicated themselves\nin a form of sexism. Indeed, Serano claims that any feminist critique\nof trans femininity is inherently anti-feminist: \n\nWhile Serano may be right to raise worries about the ways in which the\nbehavior of trans women has been unfairly judged, a position which\nallows for no analysis of politically problematic gender behavior at\nall seems to seriously impair feminism's critical force. The core\nissue is that Serano does not see gender as fundamentally relational.\nThis allows her to view gender as something that everybody ought to be\nfree to express in any way they want to (free of judgment as\n‘good’ or ‘bad’). However, once gender is\nviewed as relational, it seems entirely appropriate to raise feminist\nworries about certain forms of masculinity that involve treating women\nbadly and certain forms of femininity that involve accepting poor\ntreatment. Once gender is recognized as relational (i.e., as involving\nthe treatment of other gendered people in particular ways), it can be\nsubject to ethical evaluation (e.g.,“that gendered behavior\ninvolves hurting people”). For the very sake of trans women and\ntheir safety, such a trans feminist intervention is surely\nappropriate. \n\nIn fairness to Serano, she does not fail to note sexist relations\nbetween men and women. Indeed, she offers a rich account of the\nsexualization of trans women (2007, 253–262). In her view,\nhowever, such negative relational features which accrue to femininity\nflow from the inappropriate interpretation and evaluation of\nfemininity, rather than femininity itself. That said, the difficulty\nis how one is to distinguish femininity as abstracted from such\nrelational social meanings. Even if such a project were possible, it\nseems clear enough that feminists are concerned precisely by the\nharmful forms of masculinity and femininity that are deeply implicated\nin systems of social meaning. And it seems unfair to accuse feminists\nwho raise worries about such forms of sexism as themselves sexist, by\nconstruing them as negatively assessing some culturally abstracted\nform of femininity.  Talia Mae Bettcher (2012a; 2013; 2014) argues against both the\ntraditional wrong-body account of transsexuality (in which gender\nidentity is taken as innate, allegedly determining one's\n“real” sex) and the newer, beyond-the-binary vision that\nemerged with the new transgender politics of the\nnineteen-nineties. Both accounts invalidate trans identities, she\nargues - the first, by invalidating the self-identities of trans\npeople who do not regard their genitals as wrong, the second, by\nrepresenting all trans people as problematically positioned with\nregard to the binary (2013, 53). Moreover, both accounts fail on their\nown terms. While beyond-the-binary politics tend to marginalize trans\npeople who position themselves within the binary, and therefore fails\nas a complete account of trans oppression and resistance (2014, 387),\nthe wrong-body account fails to secure trans identity claims to belong\nto their preferred gender categories (for example, she argues,\naccording to the dominant meaning of woman, an MTF who has had genital\nreconstruction surgery is at best a difficult case (possibly a man\nowing to chromosomes, possibly a woman owing to genitalia) (2014,\n386). Bettcher's aim (2012a, 2014), then, is to provide an account of\ntrans politics that does not marginalize trans people who situate\nthemselves within the binary and that successfully grounds their\nself-identity claims. \n\nInstead of attempting to justify trans self-identity claims, Bettcher\n(2012a) argues, such claims ought to be accepted as presumptively\nvalid as a starting-point of trans theory and politics (245-6). She\nadopts the general view that (many) trans people tend to oppose the\nmeanings of mainstream gender terms and practices. In many trans\nsubcultures, she argues, the meaning of terms such as woman\nand man are altered so that both trans men and trans women\nturn out to paradigm instances of men and women respectively\n(241). For example possession of XY chromosomes does not count against\ntrans woman's claim to womanhood insofar as a trans woman is a kind of\nwoman who tends to have XY chromosomes. As a consequence of this, an\nMTF may count as a man in mainstream culture while she may count as a\nwoman in a resistant trans subculture (242). More deeply, Bettcher\nargues (2009, 110-12), the shift in meaning involves not only an\nexpansion of the category, but also a change in use, reflected in the\ngrammar of first and third person assertions. It is no longer merely a\nquestion whether the category is truthfully predicated of the object\nin question. Instead, there is a first person, present tense avowal of\ngender. For example, the claim “I am a trans woman” may be\nan avowal of a deep sense of “who one is” (that is, of one's\ndeepest values and commitments) where defeasible avowals of gender are\npresumptively taken as authoritative (2009, 110-12). The political\nconflict, at any rate, is framed in terms of competing cultural\nformations where the dominant one possesses institutional power and\nthe capacity to enforce a way of life and way of seeing the world,\nregardless of the personal costs to the trans people involved and\nregardless of subcultural socially practices which help give their\nlives meaning (2009, 115; 2012, 243; 2013, 53-54; 2014, 388-90). (One\nnotable absence, in this view, is any account of how it is that trans\npeople are motivated to transition and to occupy such trans cultural\nspaces in the first place. That is, there is no account of underlying\ngender dysphoria). \n\nBettcher characterizes the nature of trans oppression largely in terms\nof a form of transphobia she in earlier work calls the Basic Denial of\nAuthenticity (BDA) (2006b, 181) and in later work, reality enforcement\n(2013, 58-9; 2014, 392). In this type of transphobia, the identity\ninvalidation of trans men and trans women is situated in discourses\nabout appearance, reality, exposure, discovery, and deception. For\nexample, a trans woman may be viewed as “really a man disguised\nas a woman.” Importantly, for Bettcher, the invalidation is\nconnected to forms of genital verification. Explicit genital\nverification involves literally exposing or touching the trans person\ninappropriately to determined “what they are really.”\nImplicit genital verification involves euphemistic questions and\nclaims (“Have you had the surgery?” “Are you male or\nfemale?”). Reality enforcement takes two forms given by the\npossibilities of the trans person being visibly trans or passing as\nnon-trans. In the latter case, trans individuals may be viewed as\ndeceptive (when “exposed”), while in the former case they\nmay be viewed as playing at harmless make-believe. Either way, she\nargues, trans self-identities are invalidated (2007, 50-51).  Bettcher argues that an account of transphobia which appeals only\nto the imposition of a strict man/woman binary cannot account for\nreality enforcement and leads to a restricted and problematic vision\nof trans politics. Such identity invalidations often do not involve\nperplexity on the part of the transphobe about how to situate the\ntrans person categorically. On the contrary, trans people are viewed\nas “really men” or “really women” (2006b,\n184-7). Moreover, she critiques transgender politics of\nvisibility. For given that reality enforcement always produces a\ndouble-bind, Bettcher argues, such a politics may not always be\npromising. Indeed, if it is impossible for trans people to tell the\ntruth because whatever they do (“pass” as non-trans or\n“come out” as trans) yields the view that they are\nfraudulent deceivers or pretenders, then it seems that it is not\npossible to tell the truth in the first place(2006b, 188-90, 195). If\nso, the demand to “tell the truth about oneself” would\nseem misplaced. \n\nBettcher argues that by recognizing reality enforcement and resistant\nresponses to it, the perceived conflict (discussed earlier in this\nentry) between theories which reduce gender to a social construction\nand the political necessity of taking seriously trans identities which\nclaim gender realness can be better mitigated. Insofar as reality\nenforcement has sway, trans people are inevitably constructed as\nfrauds or fakes (2006b, 194). But the general claim that all gender is\nsocially constructed simply does not address the specific ways in\nwhich trans people are constructed as fraudulent. Bettcher argues that\nonce we recognize reality enforcement trans people who contest such\ninvalidation by claiming gender realness may also be viewed as\nresistant to transphobic oppression, thereby undermining the tendency\n(present in Butler) to dismiss such individuals as merely gender\nreactionary or conservative (2014, 397-99). Indeed, the Wrong-Body\nAccount itself may be viewed as response to reality enforcement\nthrough a kind of inversion where the body is now viewed as the\ndeceptive appearance which hides the true, concealed gender identity\n(2014, 399-404). \n\nA central thesis in Bettcher's account is that reality enforcement is\nexplained by the fact that gender presentation (taken as\n“appearance”) literally signifies physical sex and in\nparticular, genital status (taken as “deep reality”). If it\nis true that trans people who “misalign” gender presentation\nwith sexed body are deceivers or pretenders, then those who\n“correctly” align presentation with body tell the truth. In\nlight of this, Bettcher argues, there is a representational relation\nbetween gender presentation and sexed body (2007, 52-3). Bettcher\ndraws attention to the irony that attire is intended to conceal one's\n“privates” while it also serves to symbolically reveal that\nwhich is private (2007, 53). Insofar as it is invasive to demand\nprivate bodily information of a complete stranger, she argues, a\nsystem, enforced by violence which requires the disclosure of genital\nstatus is inherently abusive. In light of this, she argues, reality\nenforcement is inherently bound up with sexual abuse (2006a,\n205-6). \nBettcher introduces the notion of intimate\npersonhood (2012b) to further illuminate reality enforcement and its\ngrounding in gender presentation as genital representation. In this\nview, people are given to us through forms of sensory (and discursive)\naccess that admit of interpersonal closeness (intimacy) and distance\n(324). This access, she argues, and therefore intimate personhood\nitself, requires the existence of normative interpersonal boundaries\non sensory access to bodies, while the actual structure of boundaries\nis culturally contingent (325). In our culture, nakedness as a social\npossibility and a form of self-presentation, she argues, is just as\nsocially-constructed as (public) gender presentation (322). It is\ndetermined by the subjection of bodies to sex-differential boundaries\nof privacy and decency boundaries which protect both the object and\nsubject of sensory access and which provide the underlying rationale\nfor public concealment (322-3). Female nipples, for example are\nsubject to boundaries on sensory access while male nipples are\nnot. Moreover, while a man seeing a woman's genitals may constitute a\nviolation of her privacy, a woman seeing a man's may involve his\ncommitting an indecency offense against her (327). Thus, in her view,\njust as there are two forms of public gender presentation, so there\nare two sex-differentiated forms of nakedness (326) and her central\nthesis that gender presentation communicates genital status becomes\nthe more refined view that clothed gender presentation represents\nnaked gender presentation through euphemistic means (329-330).  Bettcher argues that this gender-genital representational relation\nis part of a larger non-verbal system of communication that is used in\nmanipulative heterosexual sexuality. For example, feminine attire has\nbeen used to excuse rape in “she asked for it”\ndefenses. In Bettcher's view, gender presentation as genital\nrepresentation is of a piece with this type of sexual\n“communication”: One reason for the communication of\ngenital status is to secure manipulative heterosexual sexuality (2007,\n56). Notably, this yields specific difficulties for trans women which\narise at the intersections of sexism and transphobia. For example, a\ntrans woman who is passing as non-trans may be subject to sexualized\nscrutiny (increasing her chances of being “read”) (2006a,\n207). Moreover, the very behavior which opens her to the double-binded\nmanipulations of (hetero) sexuality may appear necessarily in order to\navoid being exposed as a “deceiver” (2006a, 207). \n\nBettcher points to ways in which racist ideology, rape, and racist\naccusations of rape intersect with each other. Consider the raping of\nblack women by white men and the lynching of black men (justified\nthrough false accusation of having raped white women) as historical\ntactics of racial subordination. Bettcher argues since reality\nenforcement is involved in broader relations of sexual violence and\nsince such violence has been interwoven with racial injustice, reality\nenforcement is likewise grounded in racial oppression (2007,\n57). Indeed, Bettcher suggests that attempts to address transphobia\nwhich fail to take seriously the realities of racial oppression (by\nworking uncritically with the criminal justice system, for example)\nare bound to fail (2007, 58–60).  Bettcher concludes that her\naccount can serve as a theoretical basis for anti-racist trans and\nnon-trans feminist solidarity (2007, 57–8).  It can also\nelucidate transphobic feminist representations of trans women as\ndeceivers and rapists as fundamentally drawing on a (hetero) sexist,\nsexually abusive, and rape-facilitating system in which gender\npresentation communicates genital status. Given the interconnection\nbetween reality enforcement and sexist and racist forms of oppression,\nit behooves non-trans feminists to question the political value of\ndeploying such representations. \n\nWhile early (non-trans) feminist perspectives on trans issues were\nmarked by hostility, trans studies and politics have emerged in\ncomplex reaction and interaction with feminist and queer theory and\npolitics as something to be recognized. As time has passed, it seems the\npossibility of productive interplay between feminist and trans theory\nand politics as well as solidarity between trans and non-trans\nfeminist is being realized. This suggests a promising future for trans\nfeminist philosophical investigations. In light of the history of\ntrans/feminist interaction, it seems that the self and its relation to\noppression and resistance will continue to be a fruitful topic of inquiry.","contact.mail":"tbettch@calstatela.edu","contact.domain":"calstatela.edu"}]
