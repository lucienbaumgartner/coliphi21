According to the principle of double effect, sometimes it is\npermissible to cause a harm as a side effect (or “double\neffect”) of bringing about a good result even though it would\nnot be permissible to cause such a harm as a means to bringing about\nthe same good end. \n\nThomas Aquinas is credited with introducing the principle of double\neffect in his discussion of the permissibility of self-defense in the\nSumma Theologica (II-II, Qu. 64, Art.7). Killing one’s\nassailant is justified, he argues, provided one does not intend to\nkill him. In contrast, Augustine had earlier maintained that killing\nin self-defense was not permissible, arguing that “private\nself-defense can only proceed from some degree of inordinate\nself-love.” Aquinas observes that “Nothing hinders one act\nfrom having two effects, only one of which is intended, while the\nother is beside the intention. … Accordingly, the act of\nself-defense may have two effects: one, the saving of one’s\nlife; the other, the slaying of the aggressor.” As\nAquinas’s discussion continues, a justification is provided that\nrests on characterizing the defensive action as a means to a goal that\nis justified: “Therefore, this act, since one’s intention\nis to save one’s own life, is not unlawful, seeing that it is\nnatural to everything to keep itself in being as far as\npossible.” However, Aquinas observes, the permissibility of\nself-defense is not unconditional: “And yet, though proceeding\nfrom a good intention, an act may be rendered unlawful if it be out of\nproportion to the end. Wherefore, if a man in self-defense uses more\nthan necessary violence, it will be unlawful, whereas, if he repel\nforce with moderation, his defense will be lawful.” \nThe passage can be interpreted as formulating a prohibition on\napportioning one’s efforts with killing as the goal guiding\none’s actions, which would lead one to act with greater\nviciousness than pursuing the goal of self-defense would require.  \nLater versions of the double effect principle all emphasize the\ndistinction between causing a morally grave harm as a side effect of\npursuing a good end and causing a morally grave harm as a means of\npursuing a good end. We can summarize this by noting that for certain\ncategories of morally grave actions, for example, causing the death of\na human being, the principle of double effect combines a special\npermission for incidentally causing death for the sake of a good end\n(when it occurs as a side effect of one’s pursuit of that end)\nwith a general prohibition on instrumentally causing death for the\nsake of a good end (when it occurs as part of one’s means to\npursue that end). The prohibition is absolute in traditional Catholic\napplications of the principle. Two traditional formulations appear\nbelow. \nThe New Catholic Encyclopedia provides four conditions for\nthe application of the principle of double effect: \nThe conditions provided by Joseph Mangan include the explicit\nrequirement that the bad effect not be intended: \nA person may licitly perform an action that he foresees will produce a\ngood effect and a bad effect provided that four conditions are\nverified at one and the same time: \nIn both of these accounts, the fourth condition, the proportionality\ncondition is usually understood to involve determining if the extent\nof the harm is adequately offset by the magnitude of the proposed\nbenefit.  \nIt is reasonable to assume that agents who regret causing harm will be\ndisposed to avoid causing the harm or to minimize how much of it they\ncause. This assumption could be made explicit as an additional\ncondition on permissibly causing unintended harm: \nMichael Walzer (1977) has convincingly argued that agents who cause\nharm as a foreseen side effect of promoting a good end must be willing\nto accept additional risk or to forego some benefit in order to\nminimize how much harm they cause. Whether this kind of condition is\nsatisfied may depend on the agent’s current circumstances and\nthe options that exist.  \nDouble effect might also be part of a secular and non-absolutist view\naccording to which a justification adequate for causing a certain harm\nas a side effect might not be adequate for causing that harm as a\nmeans to the same good end under the same circumstances. Warren Quinn\nprovides such an account while also recasting double effect as a\ndistinction between direct and indirect agency. On his view, double\neffect “distinguishes between agency in which harm comes to some\nvictims, at least in part, from the agent’s deliberately\ninvolving them in something in order to further his purpose precisely\nby way of their being so involved (agency in which they figure as\nintentional objects), and harmful agency in which either nothing is in\nthat way intended for the victims or what is so intended does not\ncontribute to their harm” (1989, p. 343). Quinn explains that\n“direct agency requires neither that harm itself be useful nor\nthat what is useful be causally connected in some especially close way\nwith the harm it helps bring about” (1989, p. 344). He remarks\nthat “some cases of harming that the doctrine intuitively speaks\nagainst are arguably not cases of intentional harming, precisely\nbecause neither the harm itself (nor anything itself causally very\nclose to it) is intended” (1991, p. 511). On this view, the\ndistinction between direct and indirect harmful agency is what\nunderlies the moral significance of the distinction between intended\nand merely foreseen harms, but it need not align perfectly with\nit. \nMany morally reflective people have been persuaded that something\nalong the lines of double effect must be correct. No doubt this is\nbecause at least some of the examples cited as illustrations of DE\nhave considerable intuitive appeal: \nDoes the principle of double effect play the important explanatory\nrole that has been claimed for it? To consider this question, one must\nbe careful to clarify just what the principle is supposed to explain.\nThree misinterpretations of the principle’s force or range of\napplication are common. \nFirst, it is a misinterpretation to claim that the principle of double\neffect shows that agents may permissibly bring about harmful effects\nprovided that they are merely foreseen side effects of promoting a\ngood end. Applications of double effect always presuppose that some\nkind of proportionality condition has been satisfied. Traditional\nformulations of the proportionality condition require that the value\nof promoting the good end outweigh the disvalue of the harmful side\neffect. \nFor example, a physician’s justification for administering drugs\nto relieve a patient’s pain while foreseeing the hastening of\ndeath as a side effect does not depend only on the fact that the\nphysician does not intend to hasten death. After all, physicians are\nnot permitted to relieve the pain of kidney stones or childbirth with\npotentially lethal doses of opiates simply because they foresee but do\nnot intend the causing of death as a side effect! A variety of\nsubstantive medical and ethical judgments provide the justificatory\ncontext: the patient is terminally ill, there is an urgent need to\nrelieve pain and suffering, death is imminent, and the patient or the\npatient’s proxy consents. Note that this last constraint, the\nconsent of the patient or the patient’s proxy, is not naturally\nclassified as a concern with proportionality, understood as the\nweighing of harms and benefits.  \nWe have added a fifth condition on causing unintended harm: that the\nagent seek to minimize the harm involved. This ensures that Double\nEffect is not misunderstood as principle issuing a blanket permission\non causing any unintended harm that yields a benefit. Whether this\nfifth condition is satisfied will depend on the agent’s\ncircumstances and the options that exist. For example, as techniques\nfor managing pain, for titrating the doses of pain-relieving\nmedication, and for delivering analgesic medication have been refined,\nwhat might in the past have been an adequate justification for\nhastening death in the course of pain relief would now fail because\ncurrent techniques provide the better alternative of managing pain\nwithout the risk of hastening death. (See section 6 for a full\ndiscussion of this application of double effect.) \nA second misinterpretation is fostered by applications of double\neffect that contrast the permissibility of causing a harm as a merely\nforeseen side effect of pursuing a good end with the impermissibility\nof aiming at the same kind of harm as one’s end. Since it is\nwidely accepted that it is wrong to aim to produce harm to someone as\nan end, to rule this out is not part of double effect’s\ndistinctive content. The principle presupposes that agents do not aim\nto cause morally grave harms as an end and seeks to guide decisions\nabout causing harm while pursuing a morally good end. For example,\ndouble effect contrasts those who would (allegedly permissibly)\nprovide medication to terminally ill patients in order to alleviate\nsuffering with the side effect of hastening death with those who would\n(allegedly impermissibly) provide medication to terminally ill\npatients in order to hasten death in order to alleviate suffering. In\nthe allegedly impermissible case, the physician’s ultimate end\nis a good one — to alleviate suffering — not to cause\ndeath.  \nThe principle of double effect is directed at well-intentioned agents\nwho ask whether they may cause a serious harm in order to bring about\na good end of overriding moral importance when it is impossible to\nbring about the good end without the harm. A third common\nmisinterpretation of double effect is to assume that the principle\nassures agents that they may do this provided that their ultimate aim\nis a good one that is ordinarily worth pursuing, the proportionality\ncondition is satisfied and the harm is not only regretted but\nminimized. That is not sufficient: it must also be true that causing\nthe harm is not so implicated as part of an agent’s means to\nthis good end that it must count as something that is instrumentally\nintended to bring about the good end. Some discussions of double\neffect wrongly assume that it permits acts that cause certain kinds of\nharm because those harms were not the agent’s ultimate aim or\nwere regretted rather than welcomed. The principle of double effect is\nmuch more specific than that. Harms that were produced regretfully and\nonly for the sake of producing a good end may be prohibited by double\neffect because they were brought about as part of the agent’s\nmeans to realizing the good end.  \nThose who defend the principle of double effect often assume that\ntheir opponents deny that an agent’s intentions, motives, and\nattitudes are important factors in determining the permissibility of a\ncourse of action. If the permissibility of an action depended only on\nthe consequences of the action, or only on the foreseen or foreseeable\nconsequences of the action, then the distinction that grounds the\nprinciple of double effect would not have the moral significance\nclaimed for it (see the related entry on\n consequentialism).\n Some opponents of the principle of double effect do indeed deny that\nthe distinction between intended and merely foreseen consequences has\nany moral significance. \nNevertheless, many criticisms of the principle of double effect do not\nproceed from consequentialist assumptions or skepticism about the\ndistinction between intended and merely foreseen consequences. Instead\nthey ask whether the principle adequately codifies the moral\nintuitions at play in the cases that have been taken to be\nillustrations of it. One important line of criticism has focused on\nthe difficulty of distinguishing between grave harms that are\nregretfully intended as part of the agent’s means and grave\nharms that are regretfully foreseen as side effects of the\nagent’s means. Since double effect implies that the latter may\nbe permissible even when the former are not, those who wish to apply\ndouble effect must provide principled grounds for drawing this\ndistinction. The application of Double Effect to explain the\npermissibility of performing a hysterectomy on a pregnant woman and\nthe impermissibility of performing an abortion to save a woman’s\nlife is often singled out for criticism on this score. Lawrence Masek\n(2010) offers a thoughtful defense of the principle of double effect\nthat proposes to construe what is intended by an agent as narrowly or\nstrictly as possible while also distinguishing between motivating side\neffects and non-motivating side effects.  \nIn contrast, Warren Quinn’s proposal to substitute the concept\nof direct agency for the concept of intending to cause harm to someone\nas a means (see Section 1) would effectively broaden the category of\nresults that count as cases of causing intended harm. If the soldier\nwho throws himself on the grenade in order to shield his fellow\nsoldiers from the force of an explosion acts permissibly, and if the\npermissibility of his action is explained by Double Effect, then he\nmust not intend to sacrifice his own life in order to save the others,\nhe must merely foresee that his life will end as a side effect of his\naction. But many have argued that this is an implausible description\nof the soldier’s action and that his action is permissible even\nif he does intend to let himself be blown up by the grenade as a means\nof protecting the others from the explosion. Shelly Kagan (1999)\npoints out that if someone else were to shove the soldier on the\ngrenade we would certainly say that that the harm to the soldier was\nintended by the person who did the shoving. Equally, Kagan argues, we\nshould say that it is intended in this case (p. 145). The same kind of\nargument can be made for cases of killing in self-defense when\noverwhelming and lethal force is used. If these arguments are correct,\nthen they cast doubt on the claim that Double Effect explains the\npermissibility of these actions. Double Effect is silent about cases\nin which it is permissible to cause a death as a means to a good\nend. \nWarren Quinn has argued that double effect does not rest on the\ndistinction between intended and merely foreseen harm, but instead is\nbest formulated using a distinction between direct and indirect agency\n(see the\n Formulations\n section). Quinn’s view would imply that typical cases of\nself-defense and self-sacrifice would count as cases of direct agency.\nOne clearly intends to involve the aggressor or oneself in something\nthat furthers one’s purpose precisely by way of his being so\ninvolved. Therefore, Quinn’s account of the moral significance\nof the distinction between direct and indirect agency could not be\ninvoked to explain why it might be permissible to kill in self-defense\nor to sacrifice one’s own life to save the lives of others. But\nperhaps this is as it should be: double effect might be easier to\nexplain and justify if the range of cases to which it applies is\nlimited in this way. If Quinn’s view is correct, and if the\ndistinction between direct and indirect agency can be drawn clearly,\nthen perhaps the objections outlined above can be answered. \nIf we are more inclined to call a harmful result a merely foreseen\nside effect when we believe that it is permissibly brought about, and\nif we are more inclined to describe a harmful result something that\nwas intended as part of the agent’s means when we believe that\nit is impermissibly brought about, then there will be an association\nbetween permissible harms that are classified as side effects and\nimpermissibly caused harms that are classified as results brought\nabout intentionally, as part of the agent’s means, but this\nassociation cannot be explained by the principle of double effect.\nInstead, independently grounded moral considerations have influenced\nhow we draw the distinction between means and side effects in the\nfirst place. Empirical research by Joshua Knobe (2003, 2006) has\ndemonstrated that the ways in which we distinguish between results\nthat are intended or brought about intentionally and those that are\nmere side effects may be influenced by normative judgments in such a\nway as to bias our descriptions. This was first pointed out by Gilbert\nHarman (1976), but is now often referred to as “The Knobe\nEffect” or “The Side Effect Effect”. Richard Holton\n(2010) has observed that norm violation merely involves knowingly\nviolating a norm, while complying with a norm involves an intention to\ncomply with it, and that this might explain the asymmetry Knobe has\ndocumented in judgments about whether bad and good results are brought\nabout intentionally. This discussion raises questions about the\nsuitability of the distinction highlighted by the principle of double\neffect for serving as an evaluatively neutral basis for moral\njudgments. \nDoes the principle of double effect explain the permissibility of\nswitching a runaway trolley away from a track with five people on it\nand onto a track containing only one person? This is an alleged\napplication of Double Effect in which it seems clear to many people\nthat if one were to switch the trolley, the harm to the one person\nwould not be intended as part of one’s means of diverting the\ntrolley from the five. Of course, if the harm to the one is rightly\ndescribed as a merely foreseen side effect of switching the trolley,\nthen this alone does not show that it is permissible to cause it.\nHowever, if the proportionality condition is satisfied, and if the\nagent attempts to minimize the harm or to identify alternative means\nof saving the five and fails, then these factors together might seem\nto imply that the principle of double effect can be invoked to explain\nthe permissibility of switching the trolley. Moreover, Double Effect\nseems to explain the impermissibility of pushing someone onto the\ntrack in front of the speeding trolley in order to stop it and protect\nthe five on the track ahead. In both scenarios, a person would be\nkilled as part of saving the five; the difference in permissibility\nseems to depend on whether the death of that person is a means or a\nside effect of saving them. \nDiscussions of the Trolley Problem and the relevance of the principle\nof double effect to explaining our intuitions about it can be divided\ninto three groups. First, there are consequentialists who view the\nwidespread reluctance people feel to push someone in the path of the\ntrolley in order to stop it and save the five as irrational (Joshua\nGreene, 2013). Second, there are those who take the paired intuitions\nin the Trolley Problem as proof of the fundamental role of Double\nEffect as an implicit principle guiding moral judgment (Philippa Foot,\n1985), John Mikhail, 2011). Third, some argue that it would be wrong\nfor a bystander to switch the trolley (Judith Jarvis Thomson, 2008)\nand suggest that people’s willingness to view it as permissible\nis a result of inadequate reflection or insufficient emotional\nengagement. This group would include those who uphold the principle of\ndouble effect but deny that it provides a permission to swerve the\ntrolley (Elizabeth Anscombe, 1982) and those who reject the principle\nof double effect while conceding that the standard intuitive judgments\nabout the Trolley Problem comport with the principle as it ordinarily\ninterpreted. \nThe contrast between the Terror Bomber and the Strategic Bomber is\noften viewed as the least controversial pair of examples illustrating\nthe distinction between intention and foresight that underlies the\nprinciple of double effect. The judgment that the Terror Bomber acts\nimpermissibly and the Strategic Bomber acts permissibly is widely\naffirmed. Terror bombing was engaged in by both sides in World War II\n(see Douglas Lackey (1989) for a thoughtful historical account of the\ndecision process engaged in by Allied decision-makers and the\ncontroversy it generated at the time). The view that terror bombing is\nalways impermissible would condemn the kind of incendiary bombing\ncarried out by Allied forces in Germany and Japan.  \nThe common judgment that strategic bombing is permissible provided\nthat it is proportionate also deserves more scrutiny than it usually\nreceives when it is taken to be justified by the principle of double\neffect. How much of an obligation do military strategists have to\navoid harm to civilian populations? This is a substantive issue about\nthe conventions that constrain military decision-making and the\nprinciples that underlie these conventions. Many relevant\nconsiderations depend on judgments that are far outside the ambit of\nDouble Effect. For example, the Rules of Customary International\nHumanitarian Law displayed on the website of the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross prohibit attacks targeting civilians. They\nalso include protections denied to minimize harm to civilians:  \nRule 15. Precautions in Attack In the conduct of military operations,\nconstant care must be taken to spare the civilian population,\ncivilians and civilian objects. All feasible precautions must be taken\nto avoid, and in any event to minimize, incidental loss of civilian\nlife, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects. \nRule 20. Advance Warning Each party to the conflict must give\neffective advance warning of attacks which may affect the civilian\npopulation, unless circumstances do not permit. \nRule 24. Removal of Civilians and Civilian Objects from the Vicinity\nof Military Objectives Each party to the conflict must, to the extent\nfeasible, remove civilian persons and objects under its control from\nthe vicinity of military objectives. \nThese considerations suggest that the principle of double effect does\nnot contain, even when the principle of proportionality is included as\npart of its content, a sufficient condition of permissibility for\nbombardment that affects civilian populations. The example concerning\nstrategic bombing so frequently invoked by philosophers never mentions\na duty to warn or remove civilians. \nIt is not at all clear that all of the examples that double effect has\nbeen invoked to justify can be explained by a single principle. There\nmay in fact be a variety of considerations that bear on the\npermissibility of causing unintended harm. \nProponents of the principle of double effect have always acknowledged\nthat a proportionality condition must be satisfied when double effect\nis applied, but this condition typically requires only that the good\neffect outweigh the foreseen bad effect or that there be sufficient\nreason for causing the bad effect. Some critics of the principle of\ndouble effect have maintained that when double effect has been\ninvoked, substantive independent justifications for causing the kind\nof harm in question are implicitly relied upon, and are in fact, doing\nall of the justificatory work. These independent considerations are\nnot derived from the distinction between intended and merely foreseen\nconsequences and do not depend on it (Davis (1984), McIntyre (2001)).\nIf this criticism is correct, then perhaps the cases that have\ntraditionally been cited as applications of the principle of double\neffect are united only by the fact that each is an exception to the\ngeneral prohibition on causing the death of a human being. \nThe historical origins of the principle of double effect as a tenet of\nCatholic casuistry might provide a similar explanation for the unity\nof its applications. If one were to assume that it is absolutely\nprohibited to cause the death of a human being, then it would not be\npermissible to kill an aggressor in self-defense, to sacrifice\none’s life to protect others, to hasten death as a side effect\nof administering sedation for intractable pain, or to endanger\nnon-combatants in warfare. If one were to assume instead that what is\nabsolutely prohibited is to cause the death of a human being\nintentionally, then these cases can be viewed as cases of\nnon-intentional killing. Controversy about the principle of double\neffect concerns whether a unified justification for these cases of\nnon-intentional killing can be provided and if so, whether that\njustification depends on the distinction between intended and merely\nforeseen consequences. \nIn an essay that develops Warren Quinn’s view that Double Effect\nis best understood as resting on a distinction between direct and\nindirect agency, Dana Nelkin and Samuel Rickless (2014) formulate the\nprinciple in this way: “In cases in which harm must come to some\nin order to achieve a good (and is the least costly of possible harms\nnecessary), the agent foresees the harm, and all other things are\nequal, a stronger case is needed to justify harmful direct agency than\nto justify equally harmful indirect agency” (2014). In harmful\nindirect agency, harm comes to some victims in order to achieve a\ngood, but “nothing in that way is intended for the victims, or\nwhat is so intended does not contribute to their harm.” In\nharmful direct agency “harm comes to some victims, at least in\npart, from the agent’s deliberately involving them in something\nin order to further his purpose precisely by way of their being so\ninvolved” (Nelkin and Rickless (2014), quoting Quinn\n(1989)). \nThis way of characterizing harmful direct agency and harmful indirect\nagency could be thought of as two possible dimensions of agency in\nwhich harm is not intended, rather than as a contrast within a single\ndimension of agency. This view would be supported if it turns out that\nsome complex plans of action count as both harmful direct agency and\nharmful indirect agency. For example, consider the deliberations of\npublic health officials who propose to put in place a vaccination\nprogram in their region in order to protect citizens from a rapidly\nspreading, highly contagious, and invariably lethal disease. They\nforesee that if the program is carried out, about one in ten thousand\nvaccine recipients will experience adverse effects from the vaccine\nthat will prove fatal, and the officials have no way to identify in\nadvance which vaccine recipients will be susceptible to these adverse\neffects in order to screen them and exclude them from receiving the\nvaccine. It might seem that Double Effect is designed to explain why\nthey may proceed with the vaccination program despite these\nforeseeable, regretted, and unpreventable unintended side effects of\npromoting a good end: this might seem to be a case of indirect agency.\nAnd yet, if the officials’ desire to bring about herd immunity\nleads them to advocate a widespread program with incentives for\nparticipation or even mandatory participation, then it will be true\nthat harm comes to some victims that they have deliberately involved.\nThis would make their actions in promoting the program a case of\ndirect agency. Issues about consent may be relevant here as well: if\nthe vaccine recipients willingly assume the risk of experiencing\nadverse effects, then a full description of the program must consider\ntheir own agency in assessing the information they receive. Examples\nlike these suggest that the cases Double Effect has been taken to\napply to may involve many different dimensions of agency rather than a\nsharp contrast that concerns a single dimension of agency. \nCritics of the principle of double effect claim that the pattern of\njustification used in these cases has some shared conditions: the\nagent acts in order to promote a good end, shows adequate respect for\nthe value of human life in so acting, and has attempted to avoid or\nminimize the harm in question. However, they maintain that the\njustification for causing the harm in question depends on further\nsubstantive considerations that are not derived from the contrast\nbetween intention and foresight or the contrast between direct and\nindirect agency.  \nSome have developed this kind of criticism by arguing that the appeal\nof the principle of double effect is, fundamentally, illusory: an\nagent’s intentions are not relevant to the permissibility of an\naction in the way that the proponents of the principle of double\neffect would claim, though an agent’s intentions are relevant to\nmoral assessments of the way in which the agent deliberated (see David\nMcCarthy (2002) and T.M. Scanlon (2008). That an agent intended to\nbring about a certain harm does not explain why the action was\nimpermissible, but it can explain what is morally faulty about the\nagent’s reasoning in pursuing that line of action. \nThe principle of double effect is often mentioned in discussions of\nwhat is known as palliative care, medical care for patients with\nterminal illness in need of pain relief. Three assumptions often\noperate in the background of these discussions: \nWhen these assumptions are made, double effect seems to provide at\nleast part of a justification for administering drugs to relieve pain.\n \nYet the first assumption is false. Physicians and researchers have\ninsisted repeatedly that it is a myth that opioids administered for\npain relief can be expected to hasten death (Sykes and Thorns, 2003\nprovide a review of a large number of studies supporting this claim).\nThere is no research that substantiates the claim that opioid drugs\nadministered appropriately and carefully titrated are likely to\ndepress respiration. In a survey of research bearing on this issue,\nSusan Anderson Fohr (1998) concludes: “It is important to\nemphasize that there is no debate among specialists in palliative care\nand pain control on this issue. There is a broad consensus that when\nused appropriately, respiratory depression from opioid analgesics is a\nrarely occurring side effect. The belief that palliative care hastens\ndeath is counter to the experience of physicians with the most\nexperience in this area.” The mistaken belief that pain relief\nwill have the side effect of hastening death may have the unfortunate\neffect of leading physicians, patients, and the patients’\nfamilies to under-treat pain because they are apprehensive about\ncausing this alleged side effect. \nThe appropriate conclusion, then, is that double effect plays no role\nwhatsoever in justifying the use of opioid drugs for pain relief in\nthe context of palliative care. Why is double effect so frequently\nmentioned in discussions of pain relief in the context of palliative\ncare if its application rests on (and thereby perpetuates) a medical\nmyth? The popularity and intuitive appeal of this alleged illustration\nof double effect may have two sources. First, the point of mentioning\nthe permissible hastening of death as a merely foreseen side effect\nmay be to contrast it with what is deemed morally impermissible:\nadministering drugs that are not pain relievers to a patient with a\nterminal illness in order to hasten death and thereby cut short the\npatient’s suffering. Second, the myth that pain relief hastens\ndeath might have persisted and perpetuated itself because it expresses\nthe compassionate thought behind the second assumption: that the\nhastening of death may be a welcome side effect of administering pain\nrelief to patients at the end of life. This point of view may not be\nconsistent with invoking Double Effect as a justification: if, in the\ncourse of treating a dying patient, death is not viewed as a harm,\nthen Double Effect does not apply (see Allmark, Cobb, Liddle, and Todd\n(2010)).  \nFurthermore, the apparently compassionate assumption that the\nhastening of death is a welcome result may be unduly paternalistic in\nthe context of end of life care in which the patient is not dying.\nPatients receiving palliative care whose pain can be adequately\ntreated with opioid drugs may well value additional days, hours or\nminutes of life. It is unjustified to assume that the hastening of\ndeath is itself a form of merciful relief for patients with terminal\nillnesses and not a regrettable side effect to be minimized. Recall\nthat the most plausible formulations of double effect would require\nagents to seek to minimize or avoid the merely foreseen harms that\nthey cause as side effects. On this point, popular understandings of\ndouble effect, with the second assumption in place, may diverge from\nthe most defensible version of the principle.  \nSome members of the U.S. Supreme Court invoked double effect as a\njustification for the administration of pain-relieving drugs to\npatients receiving palliative care and also as a justification for the\npractice known as terminal sedation in which sedative drugs are\nadministered to patients with intractable and untreatable pain in\norder to induce unconsciousness (Vacco et al. v. Quill et al., 117\nS.Ct. 2293 (1997)). If artificial hydration and nutrition are not\nprovided, sedation undertaken to deal with intractable pain may well\nhasten death. (If death is immediately imminent, then the absence of\nhydration and nutrition may not affect the time of death.) The most\nplausible and defensible version of the principle of double effect\nrequires that the harmful side effect be minimized, so the principle\nof double effect provides no justification for withholding hydration\nand nutrition in cases in which death is not immediately imminent. The\ndecision to withhold hydration and nutrition seems to depend on a\njudgment that death would not be a harm to the patient who has been\nsedated. In circumstances in which it would not be a harm to cause a\nperson’s death, the principle of double effect does not\napply. \nTerminal or full sedation is a response to intractable pain in\npatients suffering from terminal illness. It involves bringing about a\nset of conditions (sedation, unconsciousness, the absence of hydration\nand nutrition) that together might have the effect of hastening death\nif death is not already imminent. In any case, these conditions make\ndeath inevitable. Two important moral issues arise concerning this\npractice. First, is terminal sedation appropriate if it is necessary\nto relieve intractable pain in patients diagnosed with a terminal\nillness, even if death is not imminent? This is what Cellarius (2008)\ncalls early terminal sedation because it does not satisfy the\nrequirement that death is imminent that is typically cited as a\ncondition of the permissibility of terminal sedation. Early terminal\nsedation could be expected to hasten death as a side effect of\nproviding palliative care for unusually recalcitrant pain. A second\nissue concerns the moral significance of the fact that once sedation\nhas occurred, death is inevitable either because it was imminent\nalready or because the withholding of nutrition and hydration has made\nit inevitable. Would it be permissible to increase the level of\nsedation foreseeing that this would hasten the death that is now\ninevitable? Traditional applications of the principle of double effect\nrest on the assumption that the death of an innocent human being may\nnever be brought about intentionally and would rule against such an\naction. Yet the assumptions that inform the popular understanding of\ndouble effect — that the physician’s guiding intention is\nto relieve pain, that the hastening of death would not be unwelcome in\nthese very specific circumstances, and that this course of action\nshould be distinguished from a case of active euthanasia that is not\nprompted by the duty to relieve pain — might seem to count in\nfavor of it. It may obscure rather than clarify discussion of these\nsituations to view the principle of double effect as a clear\nguideline. In this discussion, as in many others, the principle of\ndouble effect may serve more as a framework for announcing moral\nconstraints on decisions that involve causing death regretfully than\nas a way of determining the precise content of those decisions and the\njudgments that justify them.
