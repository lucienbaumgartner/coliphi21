Epictetus’s chief concerns are with integrity,\nself-management, and personal freedom, which he advocates by demanding\nof his students a thorough examination of two central ideas, the\ncapacity he terms ‘volition’ (prohairesis) and the\ncorrect use of impressions (chrēsis tōn\nphantasiōn). Heartfelt and satirical by turns, Epictetus has\nhad significant influence on the popular moralistic tradition, but he\nis more than a moralizer; his lucid resystematization and challenging\napplication of Stoic ethics qualify him as an important philosopher in\nhis own right.\n\n\nBorn sometime in the 50s C.E. in Hierapolis, a Greek city of Asia\nMinor, Epictetus spent a portion of his life as the slave of\nEpaphroditus, an important administrator in the court of Nero. The\ndate at which he came to Rome is unknown, but it must have been either\nprior to 68, at which time Epaphroditus fled the capital, or after the\naccession of Domitian in 81, under whom Epaphroditus was allowed to\nreturn and perhaps to resume his position. The circumstances of\nEpictetus’s education are likewise unknown, except that he\nstudied for a time under Musonius Rufus, a Roman senator and Stoic\nphilosopher who taught intermittently at Rome. Eventually receiving\nhis freedom, he began lecturing on his own account but was forced to\nleave the city, presumably by the edict of Domitian (in 89) banning\nphilosophers from the Italian peninsula. He then established his own\nschool at Nicopolis, an important cultural center in Epirus, on the\nAdriatic coast of northwest Greece, and remained there teaching and\nlecturing until his death around 135. The teaching represented in the\nDiscourses is that of his later career, around the year 108\nby Millar’s (1965) dating, at which time he walked with a limp\nattributed variously to arthritis or to physical abuse during his time\nof slavery. Epictetus never married, but for reasons of benevolence he\nlate in life adopted a child whose parents could not provide for its\nmaintenance. \nThe major compilation of Epictetus’s teaching is the four-volume\nwork standardly referred to in English as the Discourses; it\nwas variously titled in antiquity. According to their preface, the\nDiscourses are not the writing of Epictetus but are\nghostwritten by the essayist and historiographer Arrian of Nicomedia in\nan effort to convey the personal impact of his instruction. Although we\nlack independent means of verification, we have reason to be confident\nthat the works we have represent Epictetus’s thought rather than\nArrian’s own: first, because the language employed is\nkoinē or common Greek rather than the sophisticated\nliterary language of Arrian’s other writings; and second because\nthe brusque, elliptical manner of expression, the precise philosophical\nvocabulary, and the intellectual rigor of the content are quite\ndifferent from what Arrian produces elsewhere. A few scholars,\nincluding especially Dobbin (1998), argue that Epictetus must have\ncomposed them himself, the role of Arrian being merely to preserve a\nmild fiction of orality. \nThe shorter Encheiridion (titled in English either\nManual or Handbook) is a brief abridgment of\nthe Discourses, apparently including the four or more\nadditional volumes of Discourses that circulated in antiquity.\nAs such it offers a much attenuated account which is of little\nindependent value for the understanding of Epictetus’s thought and\nwhich at some points gives a misleading impression of his philosophical\nmotivations. There are also some quotations by other ancient authors\nfrom the Discourses as they knew them. A few of these\nfragments, notably those numbered by Schenkl 8, 9, and 14, are useful\nsupplements to our knowledge of Epictetus. \nThe standard Greek edition of all the above works is by Schenkl\n(1916); for the Discourses, there is also a valuable edition\nby Souilhé (4 vols., 1948–65) which includes a French\ntranslation.  Important English translations include the one\noccasionally quoted in this article, a revision by Robin Hard (1995)\nof the classic translation by Elizabeth Carter (1759). There is also a\nslightly-abridged new translation by Robert Dobbin (2008). Dobbin\n(1998) provides an extensive general introduction and notes to\naccompany a translation of Discourses Book I. \nThe so-called “Golden Sayings” is a later compendium of\naphorisms drawn from the Discourses and\nEncheiridion. \n\nThe essentials of Epictetus’s thought derive from the early or\nfoundational period of Stoicism, from the third-century writings of\nZeno of Citium, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus. Treatises he mentions by\ntitle include Chrysippus’ On Choice, On Impulse, and\nOn the Possibles, and he also mentions reading in works by\nZeno, Cleanthes, Antipater, and Archedemus. Extant reports and\nfragments of these and other Stoic works offer many points of\ncongruence with what we find in him. \nIt may still be the case that he accepts influence from other currents\nin philosophy, or that he develops some ideas on his own. The clearest\ninstance of such influence concerns Plato, for Epictetus draws much\ninspiration from the Socrates depicted in Plato’s shorter\ndialogues. Comparisons can be drawn especially to the Socrates of\nPlato’s Gorgias, with his fondness for give and take,\nhis willingness to challenge the hearer’s presuppositions, and\nhis optimism about what can be achieved through values\nclarification. The  Theaetetus may also have been influential\non Epictetus’s thinking about contemplation and the relation of\nhuman to divine; see Bénatouïl 2013.  Epictetus also knows\nthe Master Argument from Megarian philosophy (3rd c. BCE)\nand even names Diodorus and Panthoides, although this knowledge might\neasily have been drawn from Stoic treatises on logic (2.19.1–11;\nsee further Barnes 1997 ch. 3 and Crivelli in Scaltsas and Mason\n2007). \nAn argument has sometimes been made for Aristotelian influence,\nprimarily because Epictetus’s favored term prohairesis\n(see section 4.3 below) is prominent in Nicomachean Ethics\n3.1–5 as a quasi-technical term (there usually translated\n“choice” or “decision”). In particular, Dobbin\n(1991) has suggested that Epictetus’s use of this term reflects\nthe influence of the early Aristotle commentaries (1st c.\nBCE-1st c. CE), none of which has survived for our\ninspection. But neither Aristotle nor any author in the Aristotelian\ntradition is ever mentioned in the Discourses, and to obscure\nan important connection is hardly in keeping with Epictetus’s\nusual mode of presentation. It is better to make the provisional\nassumption that his interest in volition derives, like other main\nelements of his philosophy, from the early Stoa, though with greater\nemphasis. Although the term prohairesis is only barely\nattested in surviving accounts of early Stoic philosophy, there is some\nevidence to suggest that it did play a significant role; see Graver\n2003. \nEpictetus never refers by name to the second century BCE Stoics\nPanaetius and Posidonius, and although he has something in common with\nPanaetius’s reported interest in practical ethics and role-based\nresponsibilities, the evidence hardly suffices for an influence claim.\nReferences to other philosophers or schools are only in passing. He is\nimpressed with Cynicism, but sees it as a vocation to itinerant\nteaching and bare-bones living rather than as a body of doctrine\n(3.22). Epicureanism he identifies with the pleasure principle and\naccordingly despises (3.7). \n\nAny effort to come to grips with Epictetus’s thought must\nproceed from an awareness of his chosen objectives. The philosopher we\nmeet in the Discourses seeks above all to foster ethical\ndevelopment in others, keeping his personal intellectual satisfaction\nstrictly subordinate. Consequently we possess no point-by-point\nexposition of his views. The themes he regards as most difficult for\nstudents to internalize appear repeatedly and are developed and\nexpanded in many different ways. Other issues he treats sporadically\nas the occasion arises, or omits them altogether, if he regards them\nas inessential to moral development. His apparent inclination to hold\nback some of his thinking, as well as the incomplete condition in\nwhich the Discourses have been transmitted to us, make it\nquite unsafe to draw any assumption about his views from silences or\ngaps in the account we have. On the other hand, the recursive manner\nof presentation makes it unlikely that the non-extant volumes broached\nany entirely new themes. \nInterpreters must be careful not to prejudge the question of\nEpictetus’s relation to earlier Greek philosophy. While it is\nevident that his principal contentions are substantially related to\nearlier philosophical developments, claims concerning his relation to\nthe earlier Stoics, or possible philosophical innovations or shifts of\nemphasis, must be governed by a healthy respect for the fragmentary\nnature of our sources. We possess no comparable record of the oral\nteaching that took place in the Hellenistic Stoa. Where corroborating\nevidence exists in literary or doxographical works, we are justified in\ndescribing his views as reformulations of the Stoic tradition;\notherwise the question of continuity should generally be left\nopen. \n\nThe linchpin of Epictetus’s entire philosophy is his account of\nwhat it is to be a human being; that is, to be a rational mortal\ncreature. “Rational” as a descriptive term means that human\nbeings have the capacity to “use impressions” in a\nreflective manner. Animals, like humans, use their impressions of the\nworld in that their behavior is guided by what they perceive their\ncircumstances to be. But human beings also examine the content of their\nimpressions to determine whether they are true or false; we have the\nfaculty of “assent” (1.6.12–22). \nAssent is regulated by our awareness of logical consistency or\ncontradiction between the proposition under consideration and beliefs\nthat one already holds: when we are not aware of any contradiction, we\nassent readily, but when we perceive a conflict we are strongly\nconstrained to reject one or the other of the conflicting views\n(2.26.3). Thus Medea kills her children because she believes it is to\nher advantage to do so; if someone were to show her clearly that she is\ndeceived in this belief, she would not do it (1.28.8). Our hatred of\nbeing deceived, our inability to accept as true what we clearly see to\nbe false, is for Epictetus the most basic fact about human beings and\nthe most promising (1.28.1–5). \n\nEqually important for him is that human rationality has as its\nsetting a maximally rational universe. His confidence in the\nfundamental orderliness of all things is expressed in frequent\nreferences to Zeus or “the god” as the designer and\nadministrator of the universe. There seems to be no question of\ncompetition with any other deities or powers. Epictetus does sometimes\nspeak, conventionally for a Greek, of “gods” in the plural,\nbut Zeus remains unquestionably supreme: he enjoys having some company,\njust as we do (3.13.4), but does not require assistance and cannot be\nopposed. \nImmanent rather than transcendent, Zeus inheres in, and may indeed be\nidentified with, the natural order. As such he is in theory fully\naccessible to human comprehension in the same way as all objects and\nevents are accessible to our comprehension. With effort, rational\nbeings can come to understand Zeus as a person, a rational being with\nthoughts and intentions like ours. That recognition inspires awe and\ngratitude, a “hymn of praise” that it is our duty to offer\nin each occasion of life (1.16.19). \nGod is the creator of humankind as of all else, and his attitude toward\nus is one of complete benevolence. It is by his gift that we are\nrational beings, and our rational nature qualifies us as his kindred.\nMore: our minds are actually fragments of Zeus’s mind,\n“parts and offshoots of his own being” (1.14.6, 2.8.10–12).\nWhen we make choices on our own account, we exercise the very same\npower as governs the universe. Hence it can be said that Zeus has ceded\nto us a portion of his governance (1.1.12). \n\nIt is, again, the capacity for choice that makes us accountable for\nour own actions and states. Epictetus is particularly fond of exploring\nthe implications of this essentially Stoic conception. In studying his\nusage it is helpful to remember that his favored term\nprohairesis refers more often to the capacity for choice than\nit does to particular acts of choosing. The word is variously\ntranslated; the rendering “volition” is adopted here as in\nLong 2002. \nThe volition, Epictetus argues, is “by nature unimpeded”\n(1.17.21), and it is for this reason that freedom is for him an\ninalienable characteristic of the human being. The very notion of a\ncapacity to make one’s own decisions implies as a matter of\nlogical necessity that those decisions are free of external compulsion;\notherwise they would not be decisions. But humans do have such a\ncapacity and are thus profoundly different from even the higher\nanimals, which deal with impressions merely in an unreflective way\n(2.8). \nIt is the volition that is the real person, the true self of\nthe individual. Our convictions, attitudes, intentions and actions are\ntruly ours in a way that nothing else is; they are determined solely by\nour use of impressions and thus internal to the sphere of volition. The\nappearance and comfort of one’s body, one’s possessions,\none’s relationships with other people, the success or failure of\none’s projects, and one’s power and reputation in the world\nare all merely contingent facts about a person, features of our\nexperience rather than characteristics of the self. These things are\nall “externals”; that is, things external to the sphere of\nvolition. \n\nThis distinction between what is internal to the sphere of volition\nand what is external to it is the foundation of Epictetus’s system\nof value. What is ultimately worth having, the “good of\nhumankind,” consists in “a certain disposition of the\nvolition” (1.8.16). More explicitly, this disposition is the\ncondition of virtue, the proper expression of our rational nature, in\nwhich we not only act correctly and on the basis of knowledge, but also\nrecognize our kinship to god and witness with joy the god’s\norderly management of the universe. This glad condition is the only\nthing a person can properly desire. \nWe are not wrong to believe that whatever is good is advantageous to us\nand worthy of unconditional pursuit, for this is just the\n“preconception” (prolēpsis) of good which all\nhuman beings possess (1.22). But we err in applying that preconception\nto particular cases, for we frequently assume that external objects\nhave unconditional value. In reality, the various circumstances of our\nlives are merely what the volition has to work with and cannot in\nthemselves be either good or bad. “The materials of action are\nindifferent, but the use we make of them is not indifferent”\n(2.5.1). \nAdmittedly some external things are more natural to us than others,\njust as it is natural for a foot, considered solely for itself, to be\nclean rather than muddy, and for an ear of grain to continue growing\nrather than being cut. But this is only when we consider ourselves in\nisolation rather than as parts of a larger whole. As Chrysippus says,\nthe foot if it had a mind would welcome becoming muddy for the sake of\nthe whole (2.6.11). Even one’s own death is of no particular\nconcern if that is what the orderly workings of the universe\nrequire. \nThis does not mean that one is to be heedless of externals.\n“Externals must be used with care, because their usage is not an\nindifferent matter, yet at the same time with composure and\ntranquility, because the material being used is indifferent”\n(2.5.6). One can recognize that a thing is without ultimate value and\nstill act vigorously in pursuit of it, when doing so is in accordance\nwith one’s rational character. Epictetus offers the analogy of\nball players who recognize that the ball they are running after is of\nno value in itself, and yet exert their full energy to catch it because\nof the value they set on playing the game properly (2.5). \n\nThe revaluation of external objects brings with it a tremendous\nsense of confidence and inner peace. Grief, fear, envy, desire, and\nevery form of anxiety, result from the incorrect supposition that\nhappiness is to be found outside oneself (2.16, 3.13.10, etc.). Like\nearlier Stoics, Epictetus rejects the supposition that such emotions\nare imposed on us by circumstances or internal forces and are largely\nbeyond our control. Our feelings, as well as our behavior, are an\nexpression of what seems right to us, conditioned by our judgments of\nvalue (1.11.28–33). If we correct our judgments, our feelings will be\ncorrected as well. \nThe analysis is applicable also to feelings like anger and betrayal\nwhich relate to the conduct of other people. The choices made by others\nare of ethical significance only for the agents themselves; to anyone else they\nare externals and so of no consequence. One should not, then, be angry\nat Medea for her bad decision. Pity would be better than that, though\nthe really proper response, if one has the opportunity, would be to\nhelp her to see her mistake (1.28). \nEpictetus’s conception of emotional adjustment is not that one\nshould be “unfeeling like a statue” (3.2.4). Even the\nwisest person may tremble or grow pale at some sudden danger, though\nwithout false assent (fragment 9). More importantly, there are\naffective responses it is right to have. “It is fitting to be\nelated at the good”; that is, at the goods of soul (2.11.22;\n3.7.7), and one should also experience the aversive feeling he calls\n“caution” (eulabeia, 2.1.1–7) when\nconsidering potential bad choices. Gratitude toward god is also\naffective in nature (2.23). In addition, it is appropriate during the\nperiod of ethical training to experience the pain of remorse as a\nstimulus to ethical development (3.23.30–38). \n\nIn our relations with other people we are to be governed by the\nattitudes Epictetus calls “modesty” (aidōs)\nand “love of humanity”(philanthrōpia).\nModesty consists in an awareness of the perspective of others and a\nreadiness to curtail one’s own unseemly behavior; love of\nhumanity is a willingness to exert oneself on others’ behalf. The\nlatter extends especially toward those with whom we are associated by\nour particular role in life: toward children if one is a parent, toward\nhusband or wife if one is married, and so on (2.10, 2.22.20). While our\nbest service to others is in helping them develop their own rational\nnature, it is also entirely appropriate that we should act to further\nthe temporal interests of those to whom we are connected by birth or\nsituation. \nIt is a misconception to suppose that proper affection for friends and\nfamily members necessarily leaves us vulnerable to debilitating\nemotions when their welfare is threatened. Just as one can be fond of a\ncrystal goblet and yet not be upset when it breaks, having realized all\nalong that it was a fragile thing, so we should love our children,\nsiblings, and friends while also reminding ourselves of their mortality\n(3.24). The primary relationship is with god; our human relationships\nshould never give us reason to reproach god but should enable us to\nrejoice in the natural order. Concern for others, and enjoyment of\ntheir company, is indeed part of human nature (3.13.5); whereas\nirresponsible behavior driven by emotion is not. The father who remains\nat the bedside of a desperately sick child behaves more, not less,\nnaturally than the one who runs away to weep (1.11). \n\nAchieving the correct disposition of one’s capacity for choice\nrequires more than inclination. The learner must also undertake an\nextensive program of self-examination and correction of views. While\nethical development is made easier by the direct instruction and\nself-help techniques a teacher like Epictetus himself might provide, it\nis also possible without such aid. It is indeed a capability inherent\nin human nature, for the faculty that perceives and corrects errors of\njudgment is the reasoning faculty itself. It is even possible to alter\nsuch emotional dispositions as timorousness or quickness of temper,\nthrough repeated practice in giving more appropriate responses (2.16,\n2.18). \nOur ability to improve our own dispositions also provides the implicit\nanswer to any question that might be asked about human autonomy in a\nZeus-governed universe. Since for Epictetus action is determined by\ncharacter (what seems right to an individual; 1.2) and not by\nspontaneous impulses, some readers might be inclined to object that\nthis autonomy is only of a limited kind, for a person’s character\nmust itself have been assigned to him by Zeus, through the\ncircumstances of his birth and education. Epictetus would reply that\nautonomy is guaranteed not by the absence of antecedent causes but by\nthe very nature of the reasoning faculty. Specific skills like\nhorsemanship make judgments about their own subject matter; the\nreasoning faculty judges other things and also its own prior judgments.\nWhen it performs this function well, the inherited character will\nimprove over time; otherwise it will deteriorate. \n\nZeus’s power is limited in that he cannot do what it is\nlogically impossible to do. He could not cause a person to be born\nbefore his parents (1.12.28–29), and he could not have made\nvolition execute any choices but its own (1.1.23, 1.17.27). For the\nsame kind of reason, he could not, for all his benevolence, cause a\nperson’s body to be unimpeded in the way volition is unimpeded\n(4.1.100). Our bodies do not in fact belong to us, since we cannot\nalways decide what will happen to them. There is therefore a clear\ncontrast in status between body and mind or soul. Epictetus repeatedly\nuses language belittling the body or representing it as a mere\ninstrument of the mind: it is “pathetic little flesh,”\n“cleverly molded clay,” a “little donkey”\n(1.1.10, 1.3.5, 4.1.79). At least once he speaks of the body and\npossessions together as “fetters” upon the mind (1.9.11),\nlanguage that recalls the image in Plato’s Phaedo of\nthe body as prison house. Still, Epictetus appears to prefer his own\nschool’s position on the mind’s material nature to the\nPlatonic view of it as a separate incorporeal substance; at least, he\nspeaks of the mind as “breath” (pneuma) that is\n“infused” by god into the sense organs, and in one\nstriking image he describes the mind (again pneuma) as a\nvessel of water entered by impressions as by rays of light\n(3.3.20–22). \n\nEpictetus draws a sharp distinction between book learning, i.e.\nmastering the content of particular treatises, and what may be called\neducation for living, in which one acquires the attitudes and habits\nthat enable correct behavior. The latter is of paramount importance;\nthe former may be of instrumental value but if overemphasized may prove\na hindrance to ethical development. \nThe program of study offered in the school at Nicopolis included the\nreading of philosophical treatises by Stoic authors of the Hellenistic\nperiod, for instance the work On Impulse by Chrysippus\n(1.4.14) and the logical writings of Archedemus (1.10.8). Frequent\nreferences to formal logical schemata suggest that these, too, were\ntaught, as they had been in the curriculum of Musonius Rufus,\nEpictetus’s own teacher at Rome (1.7.32; cf. 1.7.5–12). Learning\nof this kind may be instrumental in developing one’s intellectual\nacumen, just as the lead weights used by athletes in their exercises\nserve to develop the muscles (1.4.13; 1.17). Finally, there is some\nevidence for instruction in what the ancients called physics\n(philosophy of nature); this is discussed by Barnes (1997). \nEducation for living is primarily self-education, a function of that\ncapacity for self-correction which is inherent in our rational nature.\nEpictetus rejects the way of thinking that says moral improvement is\nachievable only by divine assistance. \n\nThe example of Socrates serves to remind the hearer that\nintellectual independence remains the primary objective. For while\nSocrates teaches others, he is himself untaught or rather self-taught;\nhis unshakeable comprehension of ethical issues has been attained\nthrough rigorous application of methods anyone might use. Admittedly,\nSocrates was exceptionally gifted, and yet his achievement is what all\nare born for and can at least hope to match (1.2.33–37). \nDirect coaching by a philosophical teacher may nonetheless be of\nassistance to persons seeking to correct their own dispositions.\nEpictetus explains the process in Discourses 3.2. Above all,\none must attend to “desire and aversion”: one must correct\none’s emotional responses by pondering questions of value and\nindifference, for desire or fear of objects outside one’s own\ncontrol results in a host of strong emotions that make one\n“incapable of listening to reason” while experiencing them.\nFurther, one must study practical ethics, “the impulse to act and\nnot to act,” for vigorous action may be part of proper relations\nto the gods, to family members, and to the state, and those actions\nshould be orderly and well-considered. Finally, one must attend to\none’s own reasoning processes, to “freedom from deception\nand hasty judgment and in general whatever is concerned with\nassent.” This last entails some study of logic, to prevent the\nconclusions reached in the two principal areas of study from being\ndislodged “even in dreams or drunkenness or melancholy.”\nThis however is a non-technical approach to logic, grounded in\nessentials, in contrast to the sterile conundrums and oversubtle\nanalyses enjoyed by some of Epictetus’s contemporaries. \nThe actual process of self-improvement is initially a matter of\nconsciously slowing down one’s thought processes to allow for\nreflection prior to assent. “Impression, wait for me a little.\nLet me see what you are, and what you represent” (2.18.24). As\nthe habit of screening impressions becomes established, correct\nresponses will begin to come automatically. Yet constant vigilance is\nstill required, to guard against backsliding (4.3). One can never rely\nsolely on habituation. \nMore specific therapeutic techniques may also be of use to the one\nmaking ethical progress. Epictetus recommends that pupils refrain from\nusing the terms “good” and “bad,” not because\nthose terms have no application in human life, but because they are too\neasily misapplied. Thus one should “suppress” desire and\naversion, and use only plain, emotionally unadorned impulse and\ncounter-impulse (Encheiridion 2). To combat some individual\nbad habit, one should practice the opposite behavior: for instance, if\none is quick tempered, one should accustom oneself to bearing insults\nwith patience (3.12.6–12). Regular self-examination at bedtime—a\npractice borrowed from the Pythagorean tradition—will enable one\nto correct errors before they become ingrained (3.10.1). \nOccasionally Epictetus offers pre-professional advice to pupils who\nintend to pursue a teaching career of their own. He chastises the\nteacher who assigns a technical treatise in logic without providing any\npreliminary training or assessing the pupil’s capabilities\n(1.23.13). In Discourses 3.23.33 he distinguishes three\n“modes” or “characters” of philosophical\ndiscourse. The “protreptic” mode is that which convinces\nhearers, singly or in groups, to care about philosophical study as a\nmeans toward personal ethical development. The “elenctic”\nmode, named from the Socratic elenchos, is more\nconfrontational and is aimed at removing false convictions, while the\n“instructional” mode imparts sound doctrines. As Long\n(2002) has noted, the three modes are associated respectively with\nDiogenes the Cynic, with Socrates, and with Zeno of Citium, the founder\nof the Stoic school (3.21.19; cf. 2.12.5). \n\nThough much cultivated in person by the nobles of local Greek cities\n(as Brunt 1997 describes), Epictetus exerted far more influence\nthrough the written works produced by Arrian. The emperor Marcus\nAurelius was never in fact his pupil, but was so deeply impressed with\nwhat he had read as to consider himself a follower of the freedman\nphilosopher. In the early third century Origen remarks on the\npopularity of Epictetus with his own contemporaries, which he finds to\nrival that of Plato (Contra Celsum 6.2). Whether Origen was\nhimself much influenced by Epictetus’s version of Stoicism is another\nmatter, for Origen had studied the writings of Chrysippus on his own\naccount and the strands cannot easily be separated. More demonstrable\nis the homage paid to Epictetus by Simplicius, the sixth-century\nAristotle commentator, who composed a long philosophical commentary on\nthe\nEncheiridion combining Stoic elements with his own\nNeoplatonism. \nThe Encheiridion was translated into Latin by Poliziano in\n1497 and during the subsequent two centuries became exceptionally\npopular in Europe. Spanneut (1972) traces its use in monasteries in\nsuperficially Christianized form. Seventeenth-century intellectuals\nlike Guillaume du Vair, Justus Lipsius, and Thomas Gataker generally\nfound Epictetus’s Stoicism to be fully compatible with\nChristianity; see the discussion in Brooke (2006). Pascal reacted\nagainst this perception; he admired Epictetus as a moralist but\nregarded it as sheer arrogance to believe that the human psyche is part\nof the divine and can be perfected by one’s own efforts.\nDescartes adopted a recognizably Epictetan value system as part of his\npersonal ethics. An engagingly satirical portrayal of the potential\nimpact of Epictetus’s philosophy in contemporary American life may\nbe found in Tom Wolfe’s 1998 novel A Man in Full.","contact.mail":"Margaret.R.Graver@Dartmouth.EDU","contact.domain":"Dartmouth.EDU"}]
