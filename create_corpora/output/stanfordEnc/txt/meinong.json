He initiated experimental psychology\nin Austria-Hungary by founding the first psychological laboratory\nthere in 1894. However, he became primarily renowned for the so called\ntheory of objects ([Gegenstandstheorie], 1904), a\nkind of a priori ontological account that introduces and considers\nsystematically not only existent but also non-existent objects. His\napproach is not only shaped by Franz Brentano’s descriptive\npsychology, a form of phenomenological philosophy, and its connected\nnotion of intentionality (directedness of mind), but also by the\nBritish empiricists. Continuing and modifying Brentano’s philosophical\nteachings, Meinong provided important original contributions to quite\na few philosophical disciplines, most notably to ontology and metaphysics, value\ntheory, epistemology, philosophical psychology, and philosophy of\nlanguage.\n\n\n\nIn this vein, for example, he tried to lay new foundations for the\ntheory of value by going back to value-feelings (emotions) as its\npsychological basis. But although Meinong had constantly recognized\nthe fundamental role of psychology in philosophy, he became more and\nmore an opponent of psychologism. His switch to an objectivistic\naccount of a theory of value (1912) and his distinction between the\n“psychological” (mental) content and the object of a\nmental act, introduced in 1899, became hallmarks of his\nanti-psychologism.\n\n\n\nMeinong found a sympathetic reader in Bertrand Russell. However,\nRussell later rejected both Meinong’s object theory, with its\nconception of non-being, and his philosophical psychology, which\nconceives consciousness as a relation to objects via mental contents.\nRussell’s criticism was mainly responsible for Meinong’s\ninternational recognition. On the one hand, Russell made Meinong\nnotorious. On the other hand, the controversy with Russell also became\nan incentive for the development of Meinongian versions of logic and\nsemantics as a serious alternative to classical logic and\nsemantics.\n\nMeinong’s father was an Austrian Major General whose ancestors\ncame from southwestern Germany. Meinong repeatedly stressed that he was\nGerman, and he also joined political organizations of German\nnationalists. On the other hand, he was a loyal Austrian and emphasized\nhis distance from extreme, Pan-Germanist groups like those that had\ntaken up the ideas of Georg von Schönerer. \n\nMeinong showed a strong inclination to music, practically as well as\ntheoretically. He performed chamber music in a proficient way (the\npiano and especially the violin), was an amateur composer (mainly of\nLieder) and took an interest in theoretical questions\nconcerning music (for example, he was engaged in discussions with Guido\nAdler, Christian von Ehrenfels, Stephan Witasek, and Joseph Marx, and\nhe wrote reviews of Carl Stumpf’s Tonpsychologie, Vol. I\nand II). \n\nMeinong suffered from an inherited semi-blindness, a handicap that\nhe always tried to conceal, but which was already a hindrance in his\nearly years and deteriorated to almost complete blindness in the course\nof his life. Eventually, he needed people like his wife to read to him.\nSo it was rather difficult for him to become acquainted with the\nliterature of his time. In spite of such unfavorable circumstances and\nalthough Meinong rather shunned social, political and cultural exposure\n(including the giving of public lectures and participation in\nconferences), he was still able to exert considerable influence on the\nacademic community of his time. Meinong’s great achievements were\ndue in part to his ambition and perseverance, combined with diligence\nand a disciplined way of working. To a considerable extent\nMeinong’s accomplishments were facilitated by a well-organized\nfamily life for which his wife Doris bears much of the responsibility\nand credit. Meinong is a paradigm example of a bourgeois academic\nscholar — of an “Ordinarius” — around the turn\nof the century. \n\nLife-time friendships begun in Meinong’s Viennese academic\nperiod included those with the musicologist Guido Adler and the\nphilosophers (also his pupils) Christian von Ehrenfels, Alois\nHöfler, and Anton von Oelzelt-Newin. During the time of his\nprofessorship in Graz he also became the teacher of, among others,\nEduard Martinak, Stephan Witasek, Rudolf Ameseder, Vittorio Benussi,\nErnst Mally, Joseph Marx, Franz Weber, Ferdinand Weinhandl, and Fritz\nHeider. \n\nAlthough Meinong was a Roman Catholic, his early work already showed\na critical and distanced attitude towards the Catholic Church. Like\nArnold of Brescia, Meinong advocated the separation of religious and\nsecular affairs as well as the idea of the political equality of all\ndenominations. Furthermore, Meinong criticized the religious education\nin Austria’s “Mittelschulen” [high\nschools] as inadequate, since he considered it to be a\nrestriction on freedom of opinion. Meinong suggested that historians\n(and not priests) should instead teach the history of the development\nof religions and the various ways of satisfying religious needs. \n\nHis early essays, the “Hume Studies”, I (1877) and II\n(1882) — his only investigations with an explicit historical\norientation — are, as the subtitles foreshadow, nonetheless\ncritical and systematic treatises. Written under the influence of his\nViennese mentor Franz Brentano, they show Meinong’s tendency\ntowards British Empiricism (rather than Kantianism and German Idealism)\nand became relevant in the development of his object theory. \n\nMeinong’s first book On Philosophical Science and its\nPropaedeutics (1885) plays a pivotal role for the understanding of\nMeinong’s research as well as his teaching activities.\nOriginally, this book was written with the intention to criticize\ninstructions issued by the Ministry of Culture and Instruction to cut\ndown the hours of high school teaching in Philosophical Propaedeutics\n[philosophisch-propädeutischer Unterricht],\ni.e., psychology, logic and philosophy. But the book can also be read\nas a programmatic essay on Meinong’s own views on philosophy and\npsychology. He makes it clear that philosophy can be done in a\nscientific rather than in a speculative manner, and he considers\npsychology as a fundamental subdiscipline of philosophy. Teaching\npsychology and philosophy cannot consist in the attempt to present\nfinished results or accepted theories; it has to be done by performing\nexperiments and engaging in discussion, respectively. Uncertainty in\nthe domain of knowledge is not to be considered as an obstacle, but\nrather as a didactically fertile challenge and an opportunity for\nmaking progress. Because of this practically-oriented view of\nphilosophy and science, Meinong proposed the establishment of both a\nPsychological Laboratory and a Philosophical Seminar as university\ninstitutions in Graz. As an academic philosopher he made it his duty to\nfind extra time to discuss philosophical matters with his students,\nfriends, and colleagues. \n\nIn his Psychological-Ethical Investigations in Value\nTheory (1894), Meinong discussed the subjectivist economic value\ntheories of the Austrian economists Carl Menger and Friedrich von\nWieser. He took over, in principle, their subjectivist approach, but he criticized and\nmodified their theory of marginal utility in certain ways. On the one hand, he extended it to values in general, over\nand above mere economic values, on the other hand, he applied it to other axiological domains, especially to ethics. He also developed in detail\nhis idea that ethics was entirely determined by the\nvalue–disvalue [Wert–Unwert]\ndistinction. In On Emotional Presentation (1917) and other\nlater works on value theory (1912; 1923), Meinong took an objectivist\npoint of view and combined the psychological analysis of values with\nhis theory of objects. Values and norms (“oughts”,\n[Sollen]) are to be seen as special kinds of objects,\nand there are not only personal values but also impersonal ones. \n\nMeinong’s psychological works are more concerned with the\nmethodology of psychology and with what Brentano called\n“descriptive psychology” — a kind of classification\nor taking of an inventory of the mental furniture — than with\n“genetic psychology”, i.e., the experiment-based, causal\ntheory of mental (and physiological) occurrences (cf. Antonelli 2018: 3–100). Stimulated by\nTwardowski (1894) but also in critical distance to this treatise,\nMeinong combined descriptive-psychological matters with epistemological\nand ontological themes in his essay “On Objects of Higher Order\nand Their Relationship to Internal Perception” (1899). \n\nMeinong’s mature epistemological views, which are both anti-skeptical and fallibilistic, are to be found in his 1906, 1910, and 1915. He propagated a theory of evidence as the\nbasis of justification partly similar to Brentano’s (as far as\nthe “direct–indirect” and “a priori–a\nposteriori” distinctions are concerned), partly in sharp contrast\nto it, because already in 1886 Meinong added the “evidence for presumption”\n[Vermutungsevidenz] to the “evidence for\ncertainty”, something of which Brentano strongly disapproved. \n\nIn his later works (1902; 1904b; 1906; 1907; 1910; 1915; 1918) the\nvarious aforementioned philosophical disciplines are intertwined, only\nthe emphasis of the subject matters differs. Although the topics of the\nmonographs seem to be narrowly demarcated (On Assumptions\n(1902, 1910); On Possibility and Probability (1915); On\nEmotional Presentation (1917)), Meinong deals with a broad range\nof subjects so that one can make out the development of a complete\nsystem of philosophy. A work of a more general character is “The\nTheory of Objects” (1904b), a kind of manifesto, which was\ncontinued by the apologetic and also programmatic book On the Place\nof the Theory of Objects in the System of Sciences (1907). \n\nIn 1918, Meinong published his last major work — an attempt at proving the law of universal causation, i.e. the principle that assures the unexceptional causal determination of all occurrences (states, events). He provides two arguments in favor of this principle. First, he argues, following Hobbes and Brentano, that uncaused events turn out to be infinitely improbable. Second, Meinong uses an a priori proof of his own which claims that exceptionless determinacy is necessary as no occurrence can be without a state of affairs that Meinong calls its “implicans” (1918: 45–66; cf. Hartmann 1920). Meinong not only supports determinism, he also defends compatibilism because determinism, and not indeterminism, allows us to ascribe responsibility (for being guilty, or meritorious etc.) to persons (1894, §68; 1918: 92: “Freedom is not indeterminacy, and determinacy is not compulsion or coercion”).  Near the end of his life he wrote the short and yet comprehensive intellectual autobiography\n“A. Meinong” (1921a). Further biographical information is provided in Dölling 1999,\nthe first biographical monograph on Meinong, and in Dölling 2001,\nEder 1995, Kindinger 1965, Lindenfeld 1980 (Chapt. III), Raspa 2016. \n\nMeinong was neither a speculative philosopher nor a so-called\nphilosophical system thinker. Nevertheless he gradually developed a\nphilosophical system which included the main disciplines and had his\ntheory of objects at its center. Meinong’s terminology constantly\nincreased, and the number of his ideas and alleged objects grew\nsteadily — although with significant revisions of some of his\nolder views. \n\nMeinong’s metaphilosophical reflections do not yield something like a definition of what philosophy is, and\nin his autobiography he concedes that he has not yet found a\nconceptually exact formula for it. Philosophy is\nsupposed to be not a single sharply delineated science but an\nassemblage of sciences which are held together by the fact that they\nhave to do with mental phenomena (1921a: 101; 1885: 5). There are no specifically\nphilosophical objects, but everything that can be experienced\n“may be handled philosophically if treated from the point of\nview of its relation to the human thinking subject” (Hicks 1922:\n5). Because of this, psychology becomes a fundamental discipline of\nthis philosophical congeries. Another even more basic philosophical discipline is the theory of objects as it is\nthe most general, comprehensive and fundamental science.  According to Meinong, its\nrange is wider than metaphysics because metaphysics deals only with\nexisting things, i.e. with the entirety of the real. As\nmetaphysics is determined by “the prejudice in favor of the\nactual”, it can only be seen as a universal science a posteriori. However, the theory of objects goes beyond that. It is an a priori science as it has to do with whatever can be known a priori about objects. It deals essentially with objects as such, or in Meinongian words, it “has to do with the given taken in its entirety” (1904b, §§2, 11). \n\nMeinong saw himself neither in the camp of the empiricists nor in the\ncamp of the rationalists; instead he claimed to be an empirical\nalthough not a psychologistic thinker (1907, §§25–6).\nAlthough Meinong’s theory of objects is an a priori\nscience, its method can be characterized as a philosophy from\nbelow, a working method that follows the precepts of a kind of\nbottom-up thinking. There is an important analogy between the\nempirical (a posteriori) sciences and the theory of objects\nas a paradigmatic a priori science: both start from given\ndata. In the case of the empirical sciences these data are\nexperiences, while the data of the theory of objects usually are\nthings that are not existent but only subsistent [bestehend]\nor even merely outside of being [außerseiend] (1917,\n§11: 103 [92]; 1921a, Sect. 2.F: 130). This\n“empirical manner of investigating” was appreciated by\nRussell (1904: 205), for instance. Moreover, our general as well as\nour particular knowledge of language facts is able to supply us with\nadditional data as basis of further theorizing. Meinong (1904b,\n§10: 33 [103]) thus says “that the general theory\nof objects has to learn from grammar just as the specialized theory of\nobjects can and must learn from mathematics” (cf. also 1904b: 15\n[88]; 1907: 109). He also told his students that it is best\nto begin one’s investigations with linguistic data (Nachlass,\nKarton IV/b), and — because of this — that the answer to\nthe question what the common man thinks of this or that situation or\nof this or that word is an indispensable presupposition of all other\ninquiry (Nachlass, Karton XI/e; cf. Manotta 2005: 65–68). \n\nMeinong considers ethics, aesthetics and logic to be the primary\ndisciplines of practical philosophy. It is worth noting that he\ncontrasts his customary use of “logic” as a practical\ndiscipline, which was adopted from Brentano and is comparable\nto Port-Royal Logic, with Kant’s and, especially,\nHusserl’s conception of a “formal” or\n“pure” logic and also with symbolic logic,\n“Logistik”, and algebra of logic, which all can be seen as\nparts of his theory of objects.  He puts the distinction between\ntheoretical and practical disciplines primarily down to the difference\nbetween theoretical and practical interests and not to the difference\nbetween the subject matters of the sciences. In contrast to the\ndisciplines of theoretical philosophy — metaphysics, object\ntheory, and theory of knowledge, for example —, which are\ndetermined by cognitive aims, the practical disciplines set themselves\npractical goals. They can be seen as something like applied sciences\nor branches of engineering [Kunstlehren], quite comparable to\narchitecture, and nautical or military sciences. (1885: 96–98;\n1904b, §§7–8; 1907, §20: 114–30; 1921a: 103,\n130.) \n\nEpistemology has a double fact as its object: the known fact and the\nfact of knowing. Knowing is judging an objective (state of affairs, see\nbelow 4.3.1) with entitlement [Berechtigung] – both external\nand internal (1915, Chapt. IV). The external entitlement is\nprovided by the truth or truth-conduciveness of the judged objective,\nthe internal by evidence [Evidenz]. Evidence is not just a\nsubjective feeling of conviction; it is an objective feature of the\nmental act of judging (with or without certainty) and not of its\nmental content. Following Brentano, Meinong stands up for a concept of\nevidence as a basis for the theory of knowledge. Meinong, for instance,\naccepts Brentano’s views on evidence about the distinctions\n“direct–indirect” and “a priori–a\nposteriori”. Direct evidence may be given as a borderline case\nin inner perception, which is also evidence a posteriori (1906,\n§§9–13), and in knowledge of axiomatic truths, which\nis evidence a priori (1906, §1; 1915, §55). Like\nBrentano, Meinong also thinks that perceiving and remembering are\nalways cases of judging and not just representing (1915: 606–7,\n613) and that a judgement is indirectly evident if it is concluded from\ndirectly evident judgements. On the other hand, Meinong deviates in\ncertain respects from Brentano’s theory of evidence. Already in\n1886, Meinong adds “evidence for presumption”\n[Vermutungsevidenz] to “evidence for\ncertainty”. He realizes that we trust in memory, outer\nperception, and induction not blindly and by chance, although our trust\nin these abilities does not derive from anything else. This\nconfidence, Meinong concludes, can be counted as a further source of\nknowledge. It manifests itself as direct evidence, but evidence for\nsomething that may be erroneous, not certain, and he therefore calls\nit “direct conjectural evidence” ([unmittelbare\nVermutungsevidenz], 1886: 30–34). Brentano, who only\naccepted “evidence for certainty”, strongly disapproved of\nMeinong’s conception. He considered Meinong’s\nintroduction of a new special mode of cognition rather as a cutting\nthan an unravelling of the Gordian knot (Kindinger 1965, 22–3).\n– Actually this disagreement was the beginning of the estrangement\nbetween them. \n\nAs Meinong takes objectives as ideal objects, he gives up\nBrentano’s definition of truth by means of evidence. Brentano\nrejects the correspondence theory of truth, on the grounds that (among\nother things) he does not see anything in reality that would correspond\nto true negative judgements such as “there are no\nunicorns” and defines truth of judgements by their evidence\n(Brentano 1930: 139 [82]); see entries on Brentano\nand Brentano’s Theory of Judgement). Meinong adopts a\nkind of identity theory of truth, which can be seen as a borderline\ncase of a correspondence theory (Meinong 1915, §7; 1910,\n§13; see below 5.6). According to Meinong, the true negative\njudgement “there are no unicorns” has a subsistent\nobjective as its corresponding object (the fact of the non-being of\nunicorns). If the objective in question does not subsist (has\nnon-being) the judgement is false. However, though Meinong does not use\nthe notion of evidence for a definition of truth, he holds it still\nrelevant for a truth criterion because truth is a\n“proprium” of evidence (1915: 463), and evidence for\ncertainty (and for presumption, respectively) makes truth (and\nprobability, respectively) accessible to us. (A classical criticism of\nMeinong’s theory of evidence is Nelson 1908: 479–485.) \n\nMeinong’s epistemology turned out to be relevant to analytic\ntheory of knowledge. Some of Chisholm’s (1966: 38–55) rules\nof evidence, for example, are a kind of application of Meinong’s\nconception of direct evidence for conjecture. Further, Meinong’s\ntreatment of epistemic concepts like truth or\nentitlement as value concepts anticipates the epistemic\nnormativity of some internalist positions. It is also worth\nmentioning, that Meinong (1915, §54) linked the\n“principle of the self-validity of all knowing”\n(Selbstgültigkeitprinzip), a kind of prima facie\njustification principle, with the fallibilistic\nmethodological-epistemological “principle of the critical\nopenness of all knowing” (Unabgeschlossenheitsprinzip),\nwhich says that critical examination is always possible, since there is\nalways an unverified judgement left at the end of a justification\nprocess. \n\nIn his treatise “On Objects of Higher Order and Their\nRelationship to Internal Perception” (1899) Meinong explicitly\nintroduces the distinction between the psychological (mental)\ncontent [psychologischer Inhalt] and the object\nof a representation [Gegenstand einer Vorstellung]\n— a fundamentally important distinction to him that he keeps on refining and extending (subsequently\napplying it to all kinds of mental acts). \n\nMeinong’s view on non-existent and impossible objects was\nsharpened by Twardowski 1894. Twardowski’s work can be seen as\nthe occasion for Meinong to begin thinking more deeply about the\ncontent/object distinction, and indeed Meinong took over some of\nTwardowski’s arguments. However, Meinong never thought that\nTwardowski’s distinction and conception of the content of a\nrepresentation could be understood as a precise conceptual\nclarification that should be adopted unquestioningly. Meinong stated\nthat there was a great deal of interesting and useful information in\nTwardowski’s 1894 study, but he said this with respect to\n“the whole difficult and important problem of objects” and\nnot exactly in relation to the difference between content and object\n(1899, §2: 185 [141]). Meinong, for example, accepts\nTwardowski’s critical attitude to the view that there are\nobjectless, empty representations, a thesis Bolzano put forward\n“with special emphasis” (see the entry on \non Bernard Bolzano, Section 3.5). After\n1894, Meinong took psychological contents as something purely mental\nand concrete. Such contents are therefore always something\nreal. Twardowski, however, says that the content is a mental picture,\nbut he also identifies the mental content with the meaning of a name\nand with Bolzano’s objective representation (idea), i.e., the\nrepresentation (idea) in itself, or as such, [Vorstellung an\nsich]. For that reason Twardowski (1894: 31 [29]) takes\nthe content — in contrast to the (real) act — as something\nthat “always lacks reality”. Meinong, however, became more\nand more aware of the purely mental nature of the psychological\ncontent. He realized that the psychological content was not something\nabstract or conceptual in the sense of something intensional, that it\nwas not some sort of meaning at all. \n\nAccording to Meinong, all experiences\n[Erlebnisse], even the most elementary ones, are\ncomplex mental phenomena, because they contain at least three\nconstituents: (1) the act, (2) the (psychological) content, and (3) the\nobject of the experience. The first two components are intrinsically mental and, therefore, must exist if the\nexperience exists, whereas the third one need not exist, and it is usually extrinsic to the mental. If somebody\nentertains a strong hope for universal peace, for instance, then (1)\nthe act of hope (and not of hate) exists, (2) the psychological content\nexists, but (3) no universal peace may occur (there is only the\nnon-existent object the universal peace). Meinong believes\nthat experiences can have different objects\n[Gegenstände] for two reasons: (i) Different\nkinds of acts correspond to different kinds of objects (for example,\n“objecta” correspond to representations, and\n“objectives” to thoughts; see below 4.3.1). (ii) But inside\nan act, so to speak, any variation on the side of the objects is\ncorrelated with a variation of some mental component which is the\npsychological content of the experience. (See the supplement on\n  Presentation of Objects via Psychological Content.) \n\nWhat is often called “content”, especially\n“conceptual content”, is not a Meinongian psychological\ncontent. Meinong distinguishes between psychological and logical (=\nconceptual) content in his later work, but he stresses the point that\nso-called “logical content” is “not [psychological]\ncontent but object or, more exactly, it is the proximate object”\na psychological content is related to (1915: 163n). The psychological\ncontent of a presentation is not something abstract or intensional,\nwhereas the conceptual content is identified with the auxiliary\nobject, which is an incomplete object and which seems in a way akin to\na universal (1915, §23: 163, §28: 206; 1978: 368, 400; see\nalso Section 6 below). However, the connection to meaning, reference,\nand so-called “logical content” is guaranteed by\nMeinong’s ideal relation of adequateness, mentioned in the\nsupplement below.  Perhaps this is one reason why quite a number of\nMeinong’s interpreters seem to bring Meinong’s\npsychological content too close to the sphere of\nintensions. Nevertheless, Meinong thinks that the introduced\ndistinction between psychological content and logical content allows him to avoid psychologism. \n\nMeinong’s so-called self-presentation\n[Selbstpräsentation] usually counts as a mark of\nconsciousness, of the manifest mental. Experiences, i.e., conscious\nmental occurrences, are able to present themselves to a self. This kind\nof self-presentation is not yet presentation of the\nself or the ego, which was not an issue for Meinong. It should also be set apart from self-evidence in the sense of infallibility, and from inner perception, self-observation, and higher-order thinking. The whole manifest\nmental life is self-presenting, that is, all the experiences of a\nsubject are self-presenting to the experiencing subject. If you are\nhappy that it is raining, you can grasp your happiness\nin inner perception, but not by means of a separate\nmental content. That your mental experiences present themselves to you\nmeans you refer to your instantaneous experiences without the\nintermediary of a further representation of them. You are able to\nreflect upon your momentary anger or upon your feeling of shame without\nneeding a kind of mental symbol of your anger or your feeling of\nshame. \n\nUsually, the objects of experiences are not constituted by their\nexperiences: they are something mind independent and not immanent to\nconsciousness. What is immanent to the mind (consciousness) are the\nexperiences themselves. When you have a representation of red, for\nexample, you are conscious of the object red. In such a\nrepresentation of red, the red-content serves as a kind of\nsign of something, i.e., red, and is itself a mental piece of\nthe whole representation. In order to present the red-content as object\nof an inner reflective experience, you do not need a further, separate\nrepresentation with an additional mental content to which the red-content\ncorresponds as object. The red-content has the capacity to present\nitself to your mind. In general, the reference to one’s own\nexperiences does not require the intervention of an additional content.\nMeinong thinks that all inner experiences and all\nparts of them are able to be apprehended through self-presentation.\nMeinong (1910, §20: 138 [103], §43: 264\n[190–1]; 1915, §33; 1917, §1) calls\nit the self-presentation of inner experiences in opposition to\nthe other-presentation\n[Fremdpräsentation], where the content functions\nas sign for something else. Since experiences do not need to be brought\nwithin the range of apprehension by presentations (and contents) of\ntheir own, Meinong calls the self-presenting parts of an experience\n(act component and content component) and the whole self-presenting\nexperience quasi-contents. The quasi-content coincides with\nthe object that is to be apprehended or intended. When you desire\nsomething, it may also happen that you judge about your desire. The\nwhole desire, then, presents itself to your judgement without any\nsupplementary interfering content. It plays the role of a content, so\nto speak — hence the name “quasi-content.” \n\nMeinong (1906, §§11 and 13; 1910, §43) thinks that attention allows us \nto do two different things with one and the same experience and\ncontent respectively: (1) If we direct our attention to our inner\nexperience, for instance, to the red content of a representation of\nred, this very content serves for the inner perception of itself\n— the red-content becomes an intended object and serves for the\napprehension (perception) of itself. He also says that in this case the\ncontent becomes turned inwards (introversion,\n[Einwärtswendung]). (2) If the content\ncontributes to a perception or a thought of something red, the content\nconcerns something external to the mind — it serves for the\napprehension of the coordinated outer objects and can therefore be\ncalled turned outwards (extraversion,\n[Auswärtswendung]). \n\nMeinong would not accept the following highly controversial thesis\nof consciousness: \n\nThis is a thesis of self-consciousness in a twofold manner: First,\ns is conscious of itself in a direct (de se) manner —\ntherefore, the third person pronoun is used with a Castañeda\nasterisk as a sign of a “quasi-indicator”, i.e., an\nemphatic reflexive expressing the reference of the subject to itself\nqua itself (cf. the entry on \nindexicals,\nSection 5).  Secondly, s is conscious of the conscious state\nit is in.  Brentano accepted (C), with some provisos in order to avoid\nan infinite regress. Brentano thinks that conscious states (mental\nacts) are necessarily such that if a subject s is in a\nconscious state, s is also conscious of its* being in this\nstate. This self-consciousness is to be interpreted as inner\nperception, but not as a separate higher-order perception:\nEach mental act is primarily directed to an object (my hearing a sound\nhas the sound as its primary object), and it is incidentally\ndirected towards itself (my hearing a sound has itself as secondary\nobject). (See Brentano 1874, 2. Buch, 2. Kap., §§8–9;\nBrentano 1982: 22–5). Meinong would instead state: \n\nConsciousness does not automatically include some kind of\nself-reflection. An experience’s being conscious does not consist in\nthe subject’s having a higher-order thought; that is,\nconsciousness only allows self-reflection by\nself-presentation in the sense of (C2), but does not already involve\nany higher-order thoughts or inner perception in a Brentanoan\nsense. Meinong’s use of “self-presentation” seems to have two readings: (1) as an ability-based term, when you say that the self-presentation of an experience consists in its ability to be apprehended directly, that is, without any supplementary psychological content; (2) as a nondispositional term that expresses a manifest self-presentation in the sense that the experience is actually self-presented. (C3) expresses the thesis that being a self-presenting state is a mark\nof consciousness:  The whole of a person’s manifest mental life is self-presenting (understood as “selfpresentable”, as an ability-based term); that is, all experiences of a subject are in this sense self-presenting to the experiencing subject. (Cf. Marek 2003; 2012.)  \n\nAlthough Meinong is concerned with the subject matter Brentano\ncalled intentional inexistence of an object, he avoids using this term or something like intentionality. Meinong is\nnot completely sure whether “being directed to something, to an\nobject” is common to all experiences. But Meinong stresses the\npoint that experiences like representations, judgements, feelings and\ndesires are usually directed to an object (1904b, §1; 1899,\n§2: 185 [141]), and he interprets the\nintentionality of such mental occurrences in a relational rather than\nin an adverbial manner (“I am sensing (something) red”\ninstead of “I am sensing redly”). Agreeing with Twardowski,\nMeinong stresses the point that among the objects that are presented to\nthe subject, some may not exist and some may not even be possible, for\nexample the round square or the state of affairs\n(“objective”) that a biangle exists. \n\nMeinong’s philosophical psychology is influenced by\nBrentano’s descriptive psychology, but Meinong modified it in\nseveral ways. There are at least four main modifications involving\nBrentano’s view of mental phenomena, especially Brentano’s\ntripartite classification of such phenomena into representations,\njudgements, and phenomena of love and hate (or emotions\n[Gemütsbewegungen]): (1) Meinong’s first\ndeviation consists in dividing up the class of emotions into the\nclasses of feelings [Gefühle] and of\ndesires [Begehrungen]. (2) His second modification\nconsists in introducing the differentiation between serious\n[ernstartige] and fantasy [phantasieartige]\nexperiences (the latter include what he called “assumptions”). (3) He distinguishes between the act, the\n(psychological) content, and the object of a mental\nphenomenon (see above 4.1). (4) He gives up Brentano’s thesis\nthat we can be intentionally directed to one and the same object in\ndifferent ways, i.e., by different kinds of mental acts, and he argues in favor of proper, nonreal (ideal) objects corresponding to judging, feeling, and desiring. (For further investigations regarding the affinities and divergences between both philosophers, see Rollinger 2005 and Marek 2017.)  \n\nAs Meinong supposes that the different kinds of acts are coordinated\nwith the different kinds of presented objects\n[präsentierte Gegenstände], his\nclassification of mental elementary experiences [psychische\nElementarerlebnisse] allows a categorization of all\nobjects from an intentionalistic point of view: \n\nA representation does not occur in isolation — it always comes\nto mind in the context of a further, more complex mental act that\nincludes this very representation as a psychological presupposition,\ni.e., representations are always embedded in propositional\nattitudes. We do not just present the object red, we judge,\nfor example, that something is red, or that red is something\n(1910, §§38, 45; 1915, §33; 1917, §§1, 8). On\nthe other hand, no mental act can take place without the occurrence of\na representation, and hence the objects of a mental act always include\nan objectum; no objective, for instance, can subsist without an\nobjectum (even though the objectum in question may be a beingless\nobject) (1910, §20: 135 [101]). The judgement that red\nis a color presupposes the representations of red and of color, for\nexample. The common linguistic expressions of represented objecta are\nnouns or adjectives. Objecta can be continuants but also occurrents,\nand they can be either real or\nideal.[1] \nObjectives are always ideal, they are something like states of affairs\nor propositions and can be expressed (1) by an independent sentence\nlike “Red is a color” if they are judged or assumed, and\n(2) by a “that”-clause (“that red is a color”)\nor a nominal phrase (“the colorfulness of red”) if they\nare judged about (1910, §10). That which is judged\n[geurteilt] is always an objective whereas that which is\njudged about [beurteilt] is often an objectum but can be an\nobjective, a dignitative, and a desiderative as well. There is no\nobjective which is an objectum, although objectives may be the subject\nmatter of further objectives as, for example, in “Meinong\nbelieved that the round square is round”. Following his pupil\nRudolf Ameseder (1904: 54–5), Meinong stresses the point that\nobjectives can be characterized as those objects that not only can\nhave being but can also be being, whereas objecta can\nhave being but can never be being. This dictum is based on the\nlinguistic fact that the “that”-clauses “that\n(object) o is” and “that (object) o is\nF”, respectively, can frequently be replaced by the\nnominal (gerund) phrases “the being of o” and\n“the being F of o”, respectively (1910,\n§11: 61–2 [50–1]; 1915, §5: 27;\nMorscher & Simons 2001: 443–4). \n\nMeinong was not completely sure whether his classification of mental\nacts and its corresponding categorization of objects (taken\nintentionalistically) were complete (1917, §11). A candidate for\nanother category would be questions. Are questions reducible to\nsomething like a specific desire to know something, as Meinong thought\n(1910, §18), or are they ultimately irreducible? And do they have\nspecific objects of their own, which could be coined\n“quaesitives” or “rogatives” (cf. Kreibig\n1914)? One might think that another candidate would be drawing\nconclusions, because it is controversial whether inferences can be\nunderstood simply as complex judgements. Meinong did not consider this\npossibility; he just reduced inferences to particular (specially\n“motivated”) judgements about assumptions or about\njudgements (1910, §§27–32). \n\nThe distinction between fantasy (imaginary) experiences and serious\nexperiences concerns the act component. This distinction is a generalization of Meinong’s division of thoughts into assumption and judgements, which he introduces in On Assumptions (1902). Meinong, considering assumptions as a subclass of thoughts, places them “between representations and judgements”, as they are, like judgements, affirmative or negative; and like representations, without belief (1910; §§1, 59). Judgements are directed\nto objectives and involve conviction, whereas assumptions do\nnot involve conviction — they merely involve entertaining the\nobjectives they are directed at\n(1910: 376 [268]).  Meinong realized that such an entertaining\nof objectives without conviction plays a central role in our\nintellectual and emotional lives. Asking questions, denying,\nreasoning, desiring, playing games, performing or producing artistic\nworks would not be possible without assuming. In judging that A or\nB, for example, one does not judge A and B,\nrespectively — one only assumes them. Fantasy and serious cases  can also be found in the other kinds of experiences. If a representation of red has a perceptual look because a red-quale is\ninvolved, it is of a serious\ncharacter, and if the red-representation is merely\nreproductive, that is, a recollective or imaginative one, it is a fantasy experience and so only of an imaginary character.  Meinong’s application of\nthe fantasy/serious distinction to all kinds of mental acts\n(including the affective and conative dimension) may seem\nschematic and controversial, but also leads to remarkable insights into\nphenomena like art and into understanding the role of emotions in writing\nand reading fiction,  as empathic experiences and reception of art provide us with paradigmatic cases of fantasy representations, fantasy thoughts, and — especially — fantasy feelings. These are neither merely representations of emotions nor serious emotions but something intermediate between representations and serious emotions. In general, fantasy experiences are not\nimagined experiences as they are not merely representations of\nexperiences. Adopting a differentiation of Mally\n(1912: 61–2, fn.) Meinong later even distinguishes between (1)\nserious-like and (2) shadowy fantasy experiences\n[ernstartige versus schattenhafte\nPhantasieerlebnisse]. A fantasy experience (e.g., an assumption)\ncan be understood either (1) as a pretence of experiencing seriously\n(e.g., of making a judgement) or (2) as a mere entertaining of the\nobject (e.g., an objective without a pretence of judging) (1917,\n§6: 47–53 [42–47]). \n\nAssumptions do not imply conviction. Hence, no assumption can\nexhibit any evidential advantage over another assumption or can be\nchallenged on evidential grounds. From the standpoint of an evidential\nrequirement, one cannot believe everything, but one can assume\neverything, that is, one can assume any objective and one can represent\nany objectum. Meinong calls this insight the principle of\nunrestricted freedom of assumption [Prinzip der\nunbeschränkten Annahmefreiheit] (1910, §60)\nand contrasts it with the principle of relatively constrained\nassumptions, which postulates a quite unmistakable logical constraint when one\nregards one or more assumptions as already given and then logically relates\nfurther assumptions to them: “It is true that assumptions are\nwithout exception free, absolutely regarded; but for all that, they can\nbe constrained relatively.” (1910, §60: 346\n[246–7]) Over the years, Meinong maintained\nthat there were limitations of his principle of unrestricted freedom of\nassumption. He speaks of such a limitation explicitly in connection\nwith the modal moment (1915, §37: 282; see below 5.4.3), and his\ndiscussion whether some defective objects fail outside-being and were\ntherefore no loyal objects can be interpreted as limiting this freedom\nprinciple. (Cf. 1917, §2; 1978: 377–8; see below 5.3.1.) \n\nAssembling objects to a more complex object is an important activity of the mind, but it does not form a separate species of experience beyond the four aforementioned types of mental acts. According to Meinong (1902, §2; 1910, §2) two or more\nrepresentations of objecta can be used to produce a new representation\nof a complex objectum. The objects of the more simple representations\ncan be seen as the foundation of the complex object, which is always an\nobject of higher order, a superius, because it is founded by\nthe founding objects (inferiora). (See below Section 5.5.) The\ndiversity of red and green has red and green, the\ncheckered pattern has squares of different colors, and a red square has\nred and square as its inferiora. In order to get a\nrepresentation of objects of higher order, of a Gestalt, a melody, for\nexample, you have to have representations of the more elementary\nobjects on which you build the complex representation. This operation\nof the mind is called “production of representations”\n[“Vorstellungsproduktion”] because the mind is\nable to produce complex representations and not already their\ncorresponding complex objects. This conception became an important and\nfruitful, although controversial, notion in Gestalt psychology, as\nMeinong still acknowledges the primacy of the elementary\nrepresentations. The underlying elements of objects of higher order,\nfor example, are not to be seen as “only abstractly\ndistinguishable parts” which was assumed by the Berlin Gestalt\nschool. (Cf. Smith 1994, Chapt. 8: 272.) \n\nWhatever can be experienced in some way, i.e., be the target of a\nmental act, Meinong calls an object [Gegenstand\nor Objekt]. The term “object” is a\n“relation term” in the sense that “you shall not\nspeak of an object without considering a mental activity”\n(1888–1903: 47). Meinong does not see an ontological but only a\nconceptual dependence expressed by the term “object”, and\nhe does not determine an object intentionally as something that is\ngrasped but only as something that can be grasped by mental\nacts (it can be represented, judged etc.). He is neither a\nconstructivist nor a subjective idealist as he admits that the mental\nacts are not already to be thought of as something that create\nobjects. He (1904b, §4; 1921a: 110) also acknowledges the following\nconnection between “(every) thing” and\n“object”: Everything is an object, but everything is\nlogically prior to its apprehending and pre-given\n[vorgegeben] to the mind. \n\n  Not\nonly existing things but also all kinds of non-beings (nonentities,\nRoutley 1980: 7) find their place in Meinong’s all-embracing\ntheory of objects — among them even impossible objects, like the\nround square, as well as paradoxical, “defective” objects,\nlike some forms of the liar or special cases of purely\nself-referential thinking (the thought about itself, for\nexample).[2] \nSimilar to Twardowski, Meinong maintains that talking about non-beings\nis not just speaking of nothing, i.e. there can be no objectless representations and\nthoughts. He clears up the apparently paradoxical\nsentence “There are objects of which it is true that there are\nno such objects” (1904b, §3) by introducing two meanings of\n“there are”: first as outside-being\n(pre-giveness), second as being, and he tries to give a\nrational account of the paradoxical sentence by referring to two\nclosely related principles: (1) the “principle of the\nindependence of so-being from being” [“Prinzip der\nUnabhängigkeit des Soseins vom Sein”], and (2) the\n“principle of the indifference of the pure object to\nbeing” (“principle of the outside-being of the pure\nobject” [“Satz vom Außersein des reinen\nGegenstandes”]) (1904b, §3–4). \n\nThe independence principle, first formulated by Ernst Mally\nin 1903, states that “the so-being of an object is not affected\nby its non-being” (1904b: 8 [82]), that is to say, an object’s having\nproperties is independent of whether it has being or not.\nMeinong’s comments on this principle show that it combines\nseveral claims; in particular, (1) the characterization\nprinciple, which postulates that any object has those properties\nthat it is characterized as having (e.g., “The AB is\nA and B, respectively”), and (2) the denial\nof the ontological assumption, which denies that there are no true\npropositions about what does not have being (cf. Routley 1980). \n\nThe indifference principle says: “The object is by\nnature indifferent to being, although in any case one of the\nobject’s two objectives of being, its being or its non-being,\nsubsists” (1904b: 13 [86]). This formulation is\nsupposed to be less misleading than the claim that “the pure\nobject stands ‘beyond being and non-being’ ”\n[“der reine Gegenstand stehe ‘jenseits von Sein und\nNichtsein’ ”]. The latter catchphrase means\nthat neither being nor non-being belongs to the make-up of an\nobject’s nature (its so-being [Sosein]), but it should\nnot be taken to mean that an object is beyond being and non-being in\nthe sense that it neither has being nor does not have being —\nthe second clause of the indifference principle makes this\nclear. Although the non-being of an object may be guaranteed by the\nobject’s nature — as in the case of the round square, for\nexample —, the non-being does not belong to its nature. In other\nwords: Being (or non-being) is not part of an object’s nature,\nbut nevertheless “the law of excluded middle lays it down that\nevery object necessarily stands in a fact of being or in a fact of\nnon-being” (Findlay 1963: 49). It is worth noticing that there\nare two interpretations of negation (narrower, internal, predicate, or\nontological negation versus wider, external, sentence,\nlogical negation), and accordingly there are two versions of the law\nof excluded middle. Meinong seems to accept the law of excluded middle\nonly with respect to sentence negation. \n\nIn his 1915, §25, Meinong introduces in more detail the notion\nof incompletely determined objects, i.e., objects that are\nundetermined with respect to at least one property. Pure things like\nthe triangle as such are incomplete objects. The triangle as such has\nthree angles (a constitutive property), it has three sides (a\nconsecutive property, one that is somehow included in the\nobject’s constitutive properties), but it is neither scalene nor\nnon-scalene, neither green nor non-green etc. In such cases denying\nthat a is F does not imply affirming that a\nis not F, because the denial that a is F may\nalso be correct when a is not determined with respect to\nF. Incomplete objects infringe the law of excluded middle (and\nimpossible objects infringe the law of noncontradiction) with respect\nto internal negation only (predicate negation: “~”) and not\nwith respect to external negation (sentence negation:\n“¬”). Meinong would have acknowledged the validity\nof and \n\nbut he would also have admitted the theses: \n\nMore recent philosophical work shows that characterizing\ndeterminations can be constructed which go against any classical\nlogical law. The object the square such that it is not the case\nthat it is square is characterized as being square and also being\nsuch that it is not the case that it is square. These two\ndeterminations, however, lead to a contradiction involving external\nnegation. (See Routley 1980; Simons 1992: 185; Thrush 2001b.) \n\nWith respect to being, Meinong states that all complete objects have\neither being or non-being, and all incomplete objects lack being.\nMeinong’s indifference principle accommodates the law of excluded\nmiddle in the external but not in the internal version. From the fact\nthat incomplete objects do not have being, it does not follow that they\nhave non-being as well. Some of them, for example, incomplete objects\nthat are also contradictorily determined, have non-being; others, like\nthe triangle as such, are not determined with respect to being at\nall. \n\nUsing “B!” as an abbreviation for Meinong’s\n“has being”, this can be summed up as follows: \n\nThis “indeterminacy with respect to being”\n[Seinsunbestimmtheit] must not mixed up with the indifference\nto being (or outside-being [Außersein]), because every\nobject has outside-being whereas only some of them — the square (as such), for example — are not determined\nwith respect to being (1915, §25). \n\nIncomplete objects play an important role in Meinong’s late\nphilosophy, for instance as “auxiliary objects” to indicate\nthe (usually complete) target objects of our intending (see below\nSection 6), and as the basis of ascribing possibility and degrees of\npossibility to objectives. Some objectives are factual, some nonfactual\n[untatsächlich], and some are neither (i.e.\n“subfactual” [untertatsächlich]).\nThe subfactual objectives, which concern incomplete objects, constitute\nthe proper territory “where possibility is at home” (1915,\n§24: 167). Incomplete objects that are not determined with respect\nto being serve as the foundation of possibility insofar as neither the\nfactuality nor the nonfactuality of their being and their so-being\n(except their constitutive properties) is specified. For instance, the\nobjective expressed by the sentence “The [incomplete] object\nthe (fair) die will show a three with the next throw”\nhas neither factuality nor nonfactuality, but it is subfactual to the\ndegree of 1/6. The borderline cases are degree 1 (factuality) and\ndegree 0 (nonfactuality). Meinong states that incomplete objects can\nsomehow be embedded or involved in complete objects, not like a part in\na whole, but rather in the sense that for certain incomplete objects\nthere are (more) complete ones which have at least all the\ndeterminations that the incomplete objects in question have. Such an\nincomplete object, the die, for instance, can be said to be\nimplected [implektiert] in a (more) complete object: this white ivory die, for\ninstance (1915, §29; see also Section 6 below). One may apply the possibility ascription of\nincomplete objects to the corresponding complete objects in an indirect\nway. If the throw of a concrete die actually shows a three, the\nobjective “This die shows a three” is factual (degree of\npossibility = 1) and we cannot say that it really has the possibility\ndegree of 1/6. This degree of possibility can be attributed to this\nthrow in a derivative way only; its possibility is 1/6 in so far as the\nthrow is treated merely as a throw of a fair die. \n\nMeinong repeatedly ponders the question of whether outside-being is\na further mode of being or just a lack of being (1904b, §4; 1910,\n§12; 1917, §2; 1978: 153–4, 261, 358–9, 377). He\nfinally interprets outside-being as a borderline case of a kind of\nbeing (1910: 80 [62]). Every object is prior to its apprehension, i.e., objects are\npre-given [vorgegeben] to the mind, and this\npre-givenness is due do the (ontological) status of outside-being. According to Meinong’s distinction between judgements that state that something is so and so [Soseinsurteile] and judgements about the mode of being of an object [Seinsurteile], the most general determination of so-being is being an\nobject, and the most general determination of being is\noutside-being. The concept of an object cannot be defined in\nterms of a qualified genus and differentia. It does not have a negative\ncounterpart, and correlatively outside-being does not seem to have a\nnegation either (1921a, Section 2 B: 102–7). \n\nBut this claim is challenged in lecture notes from 1917/18 (1978:\n377–8), where Meinong discusses cases of negative outside-being,\nfor example so-called defective objects — objects that\ninvolve paradoxes like the liar or the apprehension of inapprehensible\nobjects. (See also 1917, §2: 22–4 [20–1])\nwhere he states that there is a typical case of something that lacks\noutside-being, namely a round square concretely presented.) In\nlecture notes from 1910 (1978: 227), Meinong also mentions\nabsurdities, examples of nonsense [Unsinn], and tries to\ncontrast them with cases of a kind of inconsistency\n[Widersinn] like the round square. Meinong tentatively\ndefines such an inconsistency as something that involves incompatible\ndeterminations [Unverträgliches] but is still\nunderstandable, whereas nonsense would be something that cannot be\nunderstood at all. “A blot of ink fiddled down on a\npiano”, “green virtue”, and “an automobile\npaved with therefore” seem to be examples of incomprehensible\nnonsense. In the end, however, Meinong gives up the attempt to\ndistinguish nonsense from mere inconsistency. Meinong’s point, rather,\nis that although the first two examples mix determinations of\ndifferent groups, his theory of objects can describe them as based on\nincompatibility, and it gives an account of this kind of\nincompatibility, whereas the last example has only linguistic but no\nobject theoretical relevance (cf. also 1978: 385–6). \n\nIf one puts the paradoxical and nonsensical cases aside,\nMeinong’s table of categories according to the modes of being\nlooks as follows: \n\nBeing has two modes, to wit existence, which is linked with\ntime, and mere subsistence, which is timeless (1910: 64 [52]). Nevertheless\nMeinong states that existence implies subsistence, and non-subsistence\nimplies non-existence (1896: 250; 1910: 74 [58]; 1915, §11: 63). All objects that subsist\n(and a fortiori all objects that exist) are completely\ndetermined, but not all complete objects exist or have being (1915,\n§§25–7: 169–202). \n\nThe ideal–real distinction is to be explained by the terms\n“existence”, “subsistence”, and “mere\nsubsistence”. In 1978, (252–3, 366–7), Meinong calls\nthose objects real (1) which exist (= “externally\nreal” [äußerlich real]), my chair or my desiring, for\nexample, or (2) which could exist by their nature (= internal reality\n[innere Realität], ibid.) as, for example, my\ngolden chair. Physical and psychological things are real.  If an\nobject that subsists also exists, it is a real object, but if\nan object that subsists cannot exist (i.e., can merely subsist), it is\nan ideal object. Hence, ideal objects can never correctly be said to\nexist. There are also ideal objects that do not subsist, for example\nthe being of a biangle or the non-identity between the morning star\nand the evening star. Absences, limits, the number (of some existent\nor non-existent) chairs, similarities, and objectives are further\nexamples of ideal objects (1899, §6; 1910, §12). \n\nRussell (especially 1905a; see also 1905b and 1907) chiefly objects\nto Meinong’s theory as inconsistent because of the following: (1)\nSome propositions about impossible objects (e.g., “The round\nsquare is round and not round”) are contradictory. (2) Although\nit is a fact that the existent present King of France/the round square\ndoes not exist, one also has to conclude (using the characterization\nprinciple; see Section 5.1 above) that he/it does exist. Russell thinks\nhe can provide a radical cure for Meinong’s inconsistencies by\napplying his theory of descriptions, which treat definite (and\nindefinite) descriptions as incomplete symbols that are to be\neliminated in favor of existential quantification and predicates.\nAccording to Russell, the problems involved stem from the mistaken view\nthat the grammatical form of language always shows its logical\nform, and that if an expression means something, there must always be\nsome thing that it means. But while denoting phrases such as “The\nso-and-so” look like referring expressions they are, in\nfact, nothing of the sort. It is because Meinong wrongly assumes that\nsuch expressions are referring expressions whose meaning is what they\nrefer to that his theory is apt to infringe logical laws. \n\nMeinong answered objection (1) by denying that beingless objects must\nobey the law of noncontradiction — only actual and possible\nobjects do (1907, §3: 16). On the contrary, thinking about\nimpossibilia makes the suspension of the law of noncontradiction\nindispensable. Meinong’s later appeal to the above-mentioned\ndistinction between negation in a wider and narrower sense (5.2.1)\nshows that he meant only the law of noncontradiction in its\ntraditional, ontological and not in its logical, propositional form.\nAccording to Meinong’s characterization principle, the round\nsquare is both round and non-round, but it is not the case that (i) the\nround square is round and (ii) the round square is not round (i.e., it is not the case that the round square\nis round). The triangle is neither\ngreen nor non-green, but nevertheless it is the case that the triangle\nis either green or not green. In such cases, Meinong does not accept\nthat the predicate negation “A is non-B”\nis equivalent to the sentence-negation “Not (A is\nB)”. The equivalence of both kinds of negation\n“(~F)x ↔ ¬(Fx)” does\nnot hold for impossibilia and incomplete objects but only for actual\nand possible objects where “possible” seems to be taken in\na strong sense that relates possibility with completeness: “Only\ncomplete objects are possible” Meinong says in a lecture note\ndating from 1910 (1978: 228). (To see that there is still a problem\nleft, see 5.2.1 above; cf. also Swanson 2011 which criticizes\nMeinong’s distinction between narrow and wide negation and argues that\nRussell’s account is to be preferred to a (Neo-)Meinongian view.) \n\nMeinong’s reply to objection (2) consists in stressing the\ndistinction between “being existing”\n[Existierend-Sein] as a determination of so-being and\n“existence” (“to exist”\n[Existieren]) as a determination of being.\nMeinong’s distinction between judgements of so-being and judgements\nof being, combined with the indifference principle that being does not\nbelong to the object’s nature (so-being), reminds one of\nKant’s dictum that being is not a real predicate. Meinong did not\naccept the ontological argument either, and argued that “being\nexisting” is a determination of so-being and can in a certain\nsense be properly accepted even of the object “existing golden\nmountain,” and, say, even of the object “existing round\nsquare,” whereas “existence”, which is a\ndetermination of being, will no more belong to the one than it does to the\nother (1907, §3; 1910, §20: 141 [105]). In\nother words, according to the characterization principle both the\nexisting round square and the existing golden mountain (Russell 1907\nuses “existent”) are existing (existent), but nevertheless\nthey do not exist. Russell (1907, 439) could not see any difference between\n“being existent” and “to exist” and had\n“no more to say on this head.” With that, the published\ndebate on nonentities came to an end. \n\nThat there is indeed a difference between “being existing\n(existent)” and “to exist” can also be made clear by a\ndistinction Meinong took over from Mally, the distinction between two\nkinds of properties (determinations), nuclear versus\nextra-nuclear properties [konstitutorische versus\naußerkonstitutorische Bestimmungen] (1915,\n§25). The nuclear properties of an object are the properties\ncharacterizing the nature of a presented object — what we might\ncall its “ordinary” (constitutive and consecutive)\nproperties —, and the extra-nuclear properties of an object are\nthose properties that are neither a constitutive nor a consecutive\npart of its nature. Some of the extra-nuclear properties may supervene\non the nature of the object, some may not. According to the\ncharacterization principle, the round square, for instance, is round\nand a square, i.e., it is determined by the nuclear properties being\nround and being a square. Being thought of by someone, on the other hand, can be seen as an extra-nuclear property of the round square which does not supervene on it. Nevertheless, the\nround square has as its supervening extra-nuclear determinations such\nproperties as being determined by the (nuclear) property\nround, being determined by two (nuclear) properties,\nbeing undetermined by the property red, being\nincomplete, being contradictorily determined, and\nhaving non-being. Similarly, the object a red\n(thing) [ein Rotes] is just red, has\nonly red as its nuclear determination, and can, therefore, be\ncalled a “simple object”, with simplicity being one of its\nsupervening extra-nuclear determinations (another is\nbeing-incomplete). \n\nIf an extra-nuclear property like simplicity were treated as a\nfurther “ordinary”, characterizing property, one would be\ncaught up in a contradiction: As the object a red thing is a\nsimple object, it has two properties, redness and simplicity, and is,\ntherefore, not simple but complex. The introduction of the\nnuclear/extra-nuclear distinction allows us to avoid this\ncontradiction. Without it Meinong would also have had problems holding\nthe principle that every particular triangle has all the properties\nthat belong to the (incomplete) object the triangle in the\nabstract. Particular triangles are triangles, have three sides\netc., and they are complete, but according to the mentioned principle,\nthey would also be incomplete. \n\nFurthermore, Meinong states that one can treat [behandeln] such\ndeterminations like complete in two ways: as an extra-nuclear\ndetermination but also as a nuclear one. If one considers an object\nthrough its three nuclear determinations complete,\nbrown, and quadrangle one has not yet decided the\nquestion whether one intends the object to have the extra-nuclear\ndetermination of completeness. But one can do this simply by\nattributing the extra-nuclear version of the determination\ncomplete. Meinong just trusts in the ability of the\nextra-nuclear function of the determination complete to ensure\nthat one intends a complete object, and he only wonders about the\nreason that makes a determination nuclear or extra-nuclear (1915,\n§26: 189–90). Our mental powers are limited as our human mind\ncannot take in the infinity of the determinations of complete objects.\nDespite this limitation we can think and speak about the world and hit\n[treffen] an existing and, therefore, complete object\nbecause we consider an object that is incomplete to be complete in its\nextra-nuclear version. The object hit by the incomplete object that is\npresent to the mind (and functions as an “auxiliary\nobject”) is called the “target object” (more about\nthis in 6 below). Nevertheless, our thinking of things in the world\nwith the aid of auxiliary objects and the extra-nuclear determinations\nmay fail. If you think “the golden mountain” in this way\nthere is no corresponding target object that exists; there is only the\nincomplete object that does not exist (cf. 1915: 740). It is worth\nnoting that you can also hit incomplete objects by this method. You\nsucceed in hitting the incomplete object the triangle as such\nwhen you simply think the object the triangle with the\nextra-nuclear determination of incompleteness (1915, §26:\n191–2). \n\nMeinong does not explicitly apply the nuclear/extra-nuclear\ndistinction to the being existent/to exist case. This is done in some\nlogical reconstructions of Meinong’s object theory which favor a\ndual property approach (for example, Parsons 1980; Routley 1980;\nJacquette 1996; see below 5.4.4 and  the entry on nonexistent objects). \n\nIn order to explain his view, Meinong resorts to the notions of the\nmodal moment and watered-down factuality\n[depotenzierte Tatsächlichkeit] (1915,\n§§37–38). Objectives can be assumed to be subsistent\n(factual), although they do not subsist (are nonfactual). For instance,\nwe can imagine that it is a fact that squares are round. This\nassumption has as its object the fact that squares are round;\nnevertheless this assumption is directed to a non-subsistent\n(nonfactual) objective. On the one hand (according to the\ncharacterization principle), the objective the fact that squares\nare round is a fact; on the other hand (as the objective in\nquestion cannot subsist), it is not a fact. Meinong explains away the\ndiscrepancy with the introduction of two readings of\n“fact”. The second reading, as Findlay (1963: 103–4)\nputs it, concerns factuality in a “full-strength” sense,\nwhereas the first reading is about factuality in a\n“watered-down” sense. The watered-down version fails a feature that the full-strength version has: Meinong calls it “the\nmodal moment”. In pure, counterfactual imagination we can\ncorrectly assume the watered-down version of factuality but we\ncannot correctly assume the full-strength version of it — there\nseems to be a lack of freedom of assumption, Meinong thinks (1915,\n§37: 282). \n\nMeinong thinks that one cannot unrestrictedly apply analytic\nsentences to the sphere of being. Analytically true sentences like\n“A (The) BA is B” do not imply the full\nfactuality of the being of the objects involved. The factuality of the\nbeing of a B, the being of an A, and the being of a\nBA, respectively, is “watered down” in such a\nsentence — it lacks the modal moment. According to this view,\n“The sun is the sun” or “The eclipsed sun is\neclipsed” has more than one reading. On the interpretation of\nthese sentences as purely analytic, no claim as to the existence of the\nsun or an eclipsed object is made. However, if an existential claim is\nimplied, the sentences could be false; they are not purely analytic\nanymore. The terms “the sun” and “the eclipsed\nsun” may express the pure objects (without any existential\ncommitment), or they may express the actual (eclipsed) sun that exists.\nBut this existence claim is an extra claim and cannot be gained through\nan analytic formula. \n\nBecause of this, only “The existent B is\nexistent”, where no existential claim is made, can be\nanalytic. In thinking “The existent B is\nexistent”, one can apprehend the existence of B, but\none cannot grasp the genuine factuality of B’s existence. In\norder to do so, one would also have to encounter the factually\nexisting object and thereby\nlearn this fact of being (= the objective of being with the\nmodal moment). One may even assert “The B which exists\nexists”, but if this sentence is to be understood as analytic, it\ncan only be interpreted as a variant of “The existent B\nis existent”. In short, it is in no way within one’s mental\npower to determine objectively which objectives have the modal moment.\nThe principle of unrestricted freedom of assumption thus finds a limit\nwith respect to the modal moment. Concerning the sentence “The\nexistent round square exists”, Meinong thinks that it is either\nanalytically true (and no existential claim is made) or it is the\nexpression of an evidentially false judgement because there exists no\nround square. It follows that for Meinong it is not possible to apply\nthe characterization principle to cases where the existence of the\nobjects is presupposed to be a fact (cf. Jorgensen 2002b). \n\nMeinong’s conception of beingless objects has proved to have\nuseful application in intentional contexts where simple applications of\nRussell’s theory of descriptions do not work. Consider the\nfollowing: \n\nThis is true, but Russell’s theory of definite descriptions\nimplies that it is false. Depending on whether the scope of the\ndescription is wide or narrow, this sentence permits two possible\nanalyses: There exists exactly one round square, and Meinong believed that\n it is round. Meinong believed that there exists exactly one round square, and\nthat it is round.  \n\nThe first analysis is false, because no round square exists. The\nsecond is false, because Meinong did not believe in the existence of\nthe round square (Routley 1980: 118–9; Simons 1992:\n184–5; Priest 2005: 109–10; cf. Castañeda 1974:\n6–10). \n\nIt is controversial whether Russell’s interpretation was naïve or\nwhether there was indeed a naïve Meinong whom Russell rightly\ncriticized. In fact, many modern logico-semantical\n“re-constructions” and philosophical interpretations show\na Meinongian object theory that is not naïve but tenable and\nfruitful. Russell’s claim that Meinong’s theory is internally\ninconsistent can be refuted. There are at least three main accounts\nthat overcome the naïvety (cf. the entries on \nnonexistent objects,\nSections 4 & 5, and on existence, section 2): (1) The first consists in the elaboration of\nMally’s nuclear/extra-nuclear distinction, which Meinong\nadopted. Routley and (in particular) Parsons (in addition to authors\nlike Jacquette) are in accord with this dual-property approach. (2)\nAnother strategy is the dual-copula approach which has its origin in\nMally’s distinction between an object’s being determined\n[determiniert sein] by a property and an object’s satisfying\n[erfüllen] a property (Mally 1912; see entry on Ernst Mally). On this approach, Mally’s distinction is interpreted as a\ndistinction between two modes of predication of properties, namely, in\nZalta’s terms, between “encoding” and\n“exemplifying” a property. Sympathetic to the dual-copula\napproach are, for instance, Castañeda, Rapaport, Zalta,\nPasniczek, and Reicher. (3) Adopting a paraconsistent logic, that is,\na logic in which inconsistencies do not imply everything, is a further\nattempt to confine the infringement of fundamental logical principles\n(Routley, Priest). One version of such an approach is Berto and Priest’s Modal Meinongianism, so-named because  “characterization is understood with reference to worlds other than the actual”, including impossible worlds. (Berto & Priest 2014: 184). \n\nSome objects are, in a way, founded on other objects. A founding\nobject is an inferius, as it is in some way inferior and also\nprior to the founded object, that is, an inferius is of lower order\nwith respect to its superior object. Such a superius is,\ntherefore, coined an object of higher order (1899,\n§§2–7). Objects of higher order presuppose founding\nobjects; you can also say that the superius supervenes on its\ninferiora. In the case of four nuts that form a plane square one can\nstate “There are four nuts on the floor”, but one can also\nstate that there is a square of nuts over there, i.e., the nuts form a\nsquare. The nuts are the founding objects, the inferiora, and the\nfounded higher object (the superius) is the square of nuts (1910,\n§§4, 6). Another example is given by the combination of the\nfollowing tokens “:–)” or by a\ncircle with three points and a round line — they make a face\npicture, a smiley. Meinong is a kind of ontological atomist as he\nthinks that there are objects of lowest order — objects which\ncannot be objects of higher order. These genuinely simple objects are\ncalled infima (1921a, Sect. 2B: 105). Although objects of\nhigher order are based on infima they are not reducible to them;\nproperties of superiora supervene on properties of their inferiora.\nInfima can be presented only by the mental act of an elementary\nrepresentation, while objects of higher order can be presented by\nrepresentations (gained by the production of representation; see above\n4.3.3) and by other mental acts as well. In Meinong’s later work,\nobjects of higher order are complexes (comprising mere collections as a\nborderline case), relations, and the aforementioned objects of mental\nacts, namely objectives, dignitatives and desideratives (1917,\n§11). Every object of higher order includes its constituents and a\nrelation which combines them in a specific way. Not all objects of\nhigher order have mereological parts. The objective “The round\nsquare does not exist” has being (subsists), although its\nconstituent “the round square” is a beingless object.\nAccording to Meinong’s examples of existing things, real objects\nof higher order may also exist (an experience or a house, for example),\nbut the number of stones and the (dis-)similarities between the stones\nof an existing house do not exist; they only subsist and are of ideal\ncharacter (1899, §6; 1978: 252). \n\nMeinong’s conception of objects of higher order was strongly\ninfluenced by Christian von Ehrenfels’ Gestalt theory (Ehrenfels\n1890). Despite some differences, there are significant similarities\nbetween Meinong’s objects of higher order and Ehrenfels’ Gestalt\nqualities (1891; 1899; cf. Smith 1994, Chapt. 8). \n\nObjectives are ideal, not real objects. They may have being or not,\nbut they cannot exist at all. Like all other (possible) ideal objects,\nthey can merely subsist. An objective which subsists can be called\nfactual — it is a fact [Tatsache]. Nonfactual objectives\n(nonfacts, [Untatsachen]) do not subsist and are thus objects\nbeyond being. “True” in its subjective sense is a\nrelative predicate as it can be attributed only to subsistent\nobjectives in so far as they are apprehended by thoughts (judgements or\nassumptions). In an analogous way one can also attribute truth to\nthoughts in so far as they present subsistent objectives\n(facts). “Truth” in its objective sense, however, simply\nmeans a subsistent objective, a fact. Hence Meinong’s truth theory is\na borderline case of a correspondence theory; it is an identity theory\nof truth (1915, §7; 1910, §13). The relation of possibility\nto probability corresponds to the relation of factuality to\ntruth. Possibility is objective and absolute, whereas probability is\nin a way subjective and relative. What is nowadays called\n“objective probability”, Meinong calls\n“possibility” (“degrees of possibility”). \n\nMeinong did not develop a comprehensive philosophy of language; his\nremarks on language are rather fragmentary and embedded as digressions\nin his object-theoretical works. In 1910, §4: 28\n[27], he summarizes his views this way: “a word\nmeans something so far as it expresses a presenting experience, and the\nobject thereby presented is the meaning\n[Bedeutung].” This statement can be generalized\nto all linguistic items: If someone judges “The golden mountain\ndoes not exist” she expresses a judgement and its presupposed\nrepresentations, and she means the objective that the golden mountain\ndoes not exist, and all the other presupposed objecta such as something\ngolden and a mountain. \n\nIn the above quotation “means” and “meaning”\nhave two uses: (1) Meaning as a relation between signs and experiences\n(acts), i.e., the relation of expressing experiences; and (2) meaning as\na relation between signs and the objects that are presented by the\nexpressed experiences (more exactly: by the corresponding psychological\ncontents), that is, the relation of expressing the objects of\nexperiences. Referring to Martinak 1901, Meinong states that signs are\nobjects which let someone know the existence of (usually other)\nobjects. A is a sign for someone if it constitutes the\nepistemic ground to an epistemic consequent B: If you can\ninfer the presence of B from the presence of A, then\nA is a sign of B for you, and the being of B\nis the meaning of the sign A. Sign and meaning in this sense\ncover a broad range of cases, including natural, “real”\nsigns like dark clouds for thunderstorm or tears for sorrow, and\nartificial, “final” signs as, for example, (groups of)\nwords express mental acts. An experience (like happiness, sorrow,\nconviction) can be expressed by an object (a smiling face, tears, and a\ngroup of words respectively). This object (more exactly: the fact that\nthere is such an object) lets you know the expressed act (experience,\nmental phenomenon) and, therefore, functions as a sign which has the\nact behind it as its meaning1. If A is the sign that has\nthe experience B as its meaning1, and if the object\nC is presented by the expressed experience B, then\nthe sign A is connected not only with B but, in a new\nway, also with C, which is the meaning2. The utterance\n“It is raining in Graz” means1 a judgement, and it\nmeans2 the object of the judgement, i.e., the objective that it is\nraining in Graz. In other words, you can say the utterance expresses\nthe judgement in one way, and it expresses the object presented by the\njudgement in another way. Meinong observes that the meaning of a word is\nusually an actual meaning for someone, but he also mentions in contrast\nto such a speaker’s meaning the potential, linguistic meaning of\na word. \n\nMeinong’s account from 1910 is represented in the schematic\ndiagram below (cf. Simons 1992, 163): \n\nWhen someone utters in a sentence “something that is\nblack” and “something that is light”, respectively,\ntwo different sorts of things can be meant by those expressions: (1)\nthe meant object is closed to further possible determination;\n(2) the meant object is open to further possible\ndetermination. If “something that is black” is used in the\nopen way, we think of the object as something that can have other\nproperties besides blackness; it may be identical with the object that\nis meant by “something that is light”. If we use the\nexpressions “something that is black” and “something\nthat is light” in the closed way, the objects meant by these\nexpressions are necessarily distinct. In general, we speak about real,\nexistent things, which as completely determined objects have infinitely\nmany determinations. As our mind can only grasp a finite number of\naspects, we usually intend the objects as open (1910, §45).\nNevertheless a question remains: That an object appears closed or open\nto us, is due to our intending (meaning). But what makes an open\nattitude open? \n\nLater, in 1915, Meinong points out that we can use incomplete objects (see\nabove 5.2, and 5.4.3), like a square brown thing, as a kind of\n“auxiliary object” [Hilfsgegenstand] to\nintend (mean) more completely determined objects, like a square brown thing in the dining room, or even complete ones\nas the “target objects”\n[Zielgegenstände] of our intending. In order to apprehend a target object, the auxiliary object has to have an “implexive being” [implexives Sein] in the target object, that is, it has to be in a way involved — Meinong says “implected” — in the more complete object. An incomplete object A is implected in a more complete object T if and only if T has all the determinations A has (cf. 1915, §§27, 29; Section 5.2.3 above). In order to aim at a complete object,\nit is essential “to include the moment of completeness\nexplicitly in the intending. If I want to intend something wholly\ndetermined by the thought ‘a square brown thing’, without\nnecessarily knowing the determinations which distinguish it from\nsomething else, I need only think of ‘a determinate square brown\nthing’” (1915, §26: 189). Meinong points out that the\ndeterminacy or completeness he hints at cannot be simply seen\nas a nuclear property — it has to be of an extra-nuclear\ncharacter. (See Section 5.4.3 above.) \n\nAs auxiliary objects are incomplete and as they can be implected in\ncomplete target objects, they bear a remarkable resemblance to things\nof abstract nature like universals, concepts or types. Indeed, in the\nappendix to his 1915 (p. 739–40) Meinong himself interprets such\nincomplete objects as platonic universals without being (see also\n1978: 368; Section 4.1 above), and he also states there: “what words mean\n[bedeuten] is the auxiliary object, and what they designate\n[nennen] is the target object” (1915: 741). This sounds\nlike Frege’s sense/reference distinction: The incomplete, auxiliary\nobjects’ role is akin to the role of Frege’s sense, which\nfunctions as the mode of presentation and the determinant of its\nreferent. Meinong’s view of incomplete objects as auxiliary objects\nhas also a close affinity with the denoting concepts view of Russell\n(1903). \n\nMeinong’s early theory of value is influenced by Carl Menger’s subjectivist\ninterpretation of value in economics as something that is not inherent\nin the goods but determined by people’s subjective\nvaluation. According to Menger (1871, Chapt. 3, §1), values are not independent real\nthings which exist outside the consciousness of men; value is rather\nthe importance [Bedeutung] that people attribute to something to the extent that\nit satisfies their needs. Meinong criticises and modifies, generalizes\nand extends that view. He is not only concerned with economic value\nbut with value in general, and he tries to apply general value theory\nto other fields than economics, for instance to ethics and aesthetics.\nAlready in his early courses on practical philosophy, Meinong bases\nethics mainly on general value theory and value theory on psychology.\n \n\nMeinong’s early theory of value (1894; 1895) can be dubbed a\nsubjectivist theory insofar as Meinong holds the thesis that value experiencies are explanatorily prior to values, that is, things have\nvalues because of our value attitudes\n[Werthaltungen], and not that we would value things\nbecause they have a value per se. A value attitude is a value-feeling [Wertgefühl], for instance, the feeling that rescuing this person from a tricky situation is good or meritorious. Value attitudes themselves are\nneither judgements about one’s value-feelings nor judgements about\nthe values of objects. A value-feeling is an emotional response to\nbelieved states of affairs and presupposes, therefore, judgements and\nrepresentations (ideas) of the intended objects as so-called\n“psychological presuppositions” (1894, §11). The\nobjects of emotions are set up before the mind by those judgements and\nideas. Genuine value errors (i.e., false\nemotional responses to presented objects) are not possible. Errors can\nonly occur in those judgements that are psychological presuppositions of\nvalue attitudes (that the person is in a perilous situation, for instance) and in misjudgements about one’s own (manifest and latent) value attitudes (1894: 77–81; 1895). \n\nMeinong (1894; 1895) thinks that there are no\nabsolute, impersonal values, and thus values cannot be defined without\nthe concept of a subject being able to have value-feelings. Values can be seen as a special relation between the object that has value and the subject for whom the object has value (1894: 71–2). \nAlthough Meinong considers himself to be a value subjectivist at this\nstage, he already includes some kind of non-subjective, namely\nintersubjective and dispositional, conditions in the\ndefinition of values. Values are conceptually determined by value-feelings, but a value cannot simply be characterized as an assemblage of value-feelings. A value judgement [Werturteil], that is, judging that something has value or disvalue, goes far beyond the actual value feeling, and therefore the decision about its truth value is primarily a matter for cognition and not for emotion (1895, §4). The verbal expression of a value judgement is neither the verbal expression of one’s actual value feeling nor the verbal judgement about one’s actual appreciation or aversion. It expresses the judgement that the thing in question has the ability to invoke appreciation or aversion by an adequately oriented subject with a normal disposition under appropriate circumstances (1894: 25; 1895: 328). \nValues are always personal or interpersonal values, that is, values for an\nindividual or a collective of individuals. In discussing moral values,\nMeinong attaches them not to an individual subject as such but to a\ncollective subject, to the “surrounding totality”\n[umgebende Gesamtheit] to which the individuals in question\nbelong — in the end up to the totality of mankind — (1894: 168ff, 205, 216–7), or, in a more personified form to the representative of social interests (1894: 187). The constitutive nature of values (and\nvalue-feelings, respectively) itself is indefinable or unanalyzable\ninsofar as it cannot be derived from concepts like utility, happiness,\npleasantness, biological needs or cost (1894, §§2–4; 1923, I,\n§§2–5). The value properties of an object are not its intrinsic, fundamental properties like common physical or psychological properties, they are higher order properties and external to the object, something dependent upon the underlying properties of the object and the subject. \n\nMeinong, being an ethical relativist and cognitivist, emphasizes that the presence of moral values is an empirical fact (1894: 170), and ethics, like value theory in general, is an empirical science  (1894: 225). Against the reproach for having fallen victim to a kind of naturalistic fallacy, Meinong could reply, first, the he does not confuse the intellectual, cognitive side with the emotional one, and second, that some facts are constituted by the intentional (emotional and intellectual) attitudes of an individual or the members of a community and, because of that, acquire a valuative character and a normative strength.  \n\nMeinong bases values on feelings and not on desires, and he\ncritically contrasted his kind of emotivism to Ehrenfels’\nvoluntarism, a more conative, desire-based theory of values. For\nMeinong, things have value because we value things, and we desire\nthings because they have value for us. (1894: 15, 25; 1895: 341, where he comes closer to Ehrenfels. Cf. Fabian & Simons 1986: 57–75; Schuhmann 2001, Reicher 2009.)  \n\nLater on, Meinong (1912; 1917; 1923) became a value objectivist, and\nvalue theory was taken up into his theory of objects together with his\nepistemology and philosophical psychology. He does not consider value experiences as constitutive of values anymore. Value experiences make values only accessible to the subject. They have a presenting function of their own (“emotional\npresentation”) and are a means of apprehending values analogous to sensations in perception. Moreover, a value experience or value attitude has to be\ndistinguished from the corresponding value judgement. Despite the subjectivity of\nsensible qualities, one does not want to talk about a personal color\nor a personal hardness, Meinong says. In a similar vein, it is not the\ncase that each value has to be a personal value just because it comes\nto us only through the mediation of value experiences (1923,\nChapt. IV, §7: 152). Perception includes perceptual judgements on the basis of\nsensations, i.e., perceptive representations\n[Wahrnehmungsvorstellungen]. The value judgement completes the\nvaluation as the perceptual judgement completes the perception: (1)\njust as one is permitted to derive the existence of colored things\nfrom color sensations, so one is justified in deriving the realization\nof value properties from value experiences; (2) just as sensations can\nbe illusory and even hallucinatory, so emotions may be unwarranted;\nthe judgement that an object has value may be false, hence, genuine\nvalue errors (and not only errors concerning the presupposed cognitive\njudgements) are possible. Because emotions are more susceptible to a\nsubjective bias, they are not as reliable a source of knowledge as\nsensations are (1912: 13). Meinong is no longer either a value subjectivist or a\nrelativist. He became a realist concerning objective values as he believes\nthat value experiences are able to present not only subjective, personal\nvalues but also objective, absolute, impersonal values: “An object has value in this [new] sense not just because a\nsubject is interested in it, but only insofar it merits this interest.” (1912, Sect. IV: 12) \n\nYet, Meinong does not give up the assumption of personal values. A personal value of an object is the emotional significance [emotionale Bedeutung] that a subject\nis disposed to assign to that object (1923, Chapt. IV, §6: 144–5,\n§7: 162), or, in other words, it is the aptitude of the object to\narouse a certain value experience in the subject (1917, §13: 151\n[132], 156 [136]). Impersonal values, by contrast, are not based on value attitudes; they are independent from them, but we can give them a\nsubjective characterization (not a definition). As an object in its\nmost general sense is describable, although not definable, as\nsomething that is able to become an object of experience, values can\nalso be described (but not defined) by their dispositional property of\nbeing able to become objects of value experiences. However, value experiences\nare not only a means of recognizing a dispositional value property;\nthey are also a means of recognizing the actual value property, that is\nthe underlying foundation or basis of the disposition. In accordance\nwith Meinong’s theory of dispositional properties (1919), a disposition has\nan actual quality as its foundation. The actual feature that is the\nfoundation of the disposition to generate value experiences in the\nsubject is determined purely objectively, i.e., without any\nreference to subjects. According to Meinong, there are objective\nvalues, interpreted (1) as dispositions to produce value experiences,\nand (2) as the foundations of this disposition (1923, Chapt. IV,\n§7: 151). \nThe genuine objects of emotions are called “dignitatives”; examples are the good and the beautiful. Ought\n[Sollen] and expediency [Zweckmäßigkeit]\nare the paradigms of the so-called desideratives, the genuine objects\nof desires (1917, §11). Like objectives, the genuine objects of\nthinking, both dignitatives and desideratives can subsist or\nnot,[3]\nand they are ideal objects and cannot be reduced to something mental\nor physical. As value properties are not reducible to natural\nproperties, they are in some way unanalyzable. Goodness, for example\ncannot be defined in terms of pleasure, and moral value judgements are\nnot to be reduced to psychological or sociological reports on moral\nbehavior. Furthermore, dignitatives and desideratives have a complex\nnature because the presuppose certain things and states of affairs. A\nperson has an aesthetic emotion, for example, when a building is\npresented to her as beautiful. The presented beauty (of the building)\nis the genuine, proper object [Eigengegenstand] — the\ndignitative — of the aesthetic emotion, while the building\nitself is the presupposed, appropriated [angeeignete\nGegenstand] of the emotion in question. Dignitatives and\ndesideratives then are objects of higher order (1917: 107–8\n[95–6]) — they are superiora (see above\n5.5; against the view that ought is an object of higher order, see\nWeber 2004: 31–3). Just as one can see four nuts as a square of\nnuts, or a circle with two dots and an arc as a smiling face, so a\ndonation to a charitable fund can be seen (grasped) as a morally good\ndeed. Grasping value properties can be interpreted as a certain kind\nof grasping of a Gestalt, as Ehrenfels and other Gestalt theorists\nmight have said. There are, we might say, good-Gestalten (the Gestalt\nof the moral good, the aesthetic good, and so on). The main difference\nbetween this sort of “value perception” and sensory\nperception is that, instead of (or in addition to) sense impressions,\nemotional impressions are involved. Meinong thinks that “the\nindefinability of impersonal values is not to be put on a par with the\none of color or sound, but rather with the one of melody or form\n[Gestalt]” (1923, Chapt. IV, §7: 161). \n\nMeinong calls the dignitatives and the desideratives that are of impersonal nature “dignities” and “desiderata”, respectively (1917, §15). Axiological (and deontological) knowledge is possible since feelings (and desires) that present factual dignities\n(and desiderata) can be justified. A feeling can be described as justified if the\ncorresponding judgement attributing the dignity to the presupposed\nobject is justified (1917, §12). Meinong sees here a kinship to Brentano’s “love with the character of rightness” or  “correct love” (Brentano 1889, §27), which can be understood as “evidence-analogue” to the evidence of judgements, but Meinong emphasizes that only the evidence of judgements itself makes such a justification possible and “an evidence-analogue for feelings and desires is therefore not required” (1917: 131 [115]). As values have to be taken as ideal things that cannot exist but only subsist, Meinong thinks that axiological (and, similarly, deontological) knowledge is a priori (1917, §12). He is convinced that “there are laws for so to speak correct desires as there are laws for the correct deriving of conclusions” (1917: 128). Already in 1912 Meinong admits  self-critically that his naturalistic, “exclusively psychological” account of value has been shown to rest on an inadmissible, faulty psychologism (see also 1917: 168 [146]).
