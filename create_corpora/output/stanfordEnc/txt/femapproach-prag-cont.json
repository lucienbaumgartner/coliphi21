This entry\nprovides an overview of the group of feminist thinkers whose work\nincorporates elements of both continental and pragmatist\nphilosophies.\n\n\nGiven the occasional confusion of the colloquial and the philosophical\nsenses of the term “pragmatism” and the slipperiness of\nthe term “continental” (or “postmodern”)\nphilosophy, a word about the two fields is in order before turning to\nfeminist approaches to their intersections. The so-called classical\nperiod of American philosophy, best known for its creation of American\npragmatism, was developed in the United States from the late\nnineteenth to the middle of the twentieth century by figures such as\nJane Addams, W.E.B. Du Bois, John Dewey, William James, Alain Locke,\nGeorge Herbert Mead, Charles Sanders Peirce, Josiah Royce, and Alfred\nNorth\n Whitehead.[1]\n Waning in popularity after the Second World War, American pragmatist\nphilosophy experienced a revival in the 1970s, often credited to the\n“neo-pragmatist” work of Richard Rorty (see especially\nRorty 1979), that continues today. Far from being an anti-theoretical\nposition that champions level-headed practicality as is sometimes\nthought, pragmatist philosophy stresses the dynamic relationship\nbetween theory and practice and especially the value of each for\ntransforming the other. It seeks to undermine other sharp dichotomies\nas well, including those between body and mind, subject and object,\nends and means, and nature and culture. Viewing knowledge as a tool\nfor enriching experience, pragmatism tends to be pluralistic,\nexperimental, fallibilist, and naturalistic. Rejecting the quest for\nabsolute certainty, it takes a meliorist attitude that human action\nsometimes can improve the world.\n\n\nPragmatism’s emphasis on experience, developed in the wake of Darwin’s\nevolutionary theory, perhaps best distinguishes it from other\nphilosophical fields. Pragmatism demands that philosophy grow out of\nand test its merits in the “soil” of lived experience.\nThis is not to abjure abstraction, but rather to insist that\nphilosophy deal with the genuine problems of living organisms, not the\nartificial problems of an academic discipline. It is important to\nrealize, however, that pragmatists understand the concept of\nexperience as “double-barrelled,” in James’s words (James\nquoted in Dewey 2000, 463). Experience refers not only to the\nso-called “subjective” experience of a living being, but\nalso to the “objective” world that is experienced by it.\nBiology and evolutionary theory teach that plants and non-human\nanimals cannot live apart from the environments that feed and sustain\nthem. Pragmatist philosophy incorporates this lesson by insisting that\nall of experience, including human experience, needs to be understood\nas an interaction between organism and environment. Functional\ndistinctions can be made between the two, but for pragmatism, no sharp\ndichotomy between them exists.\n\n\nContinental philosophy is more difficult to define as a class.\nSomewhat ironically, the concept of continental philosophy is a\ncreation of philosophers in the United States who focus on (or who are\ninfluenced by) the work of post-Enlightenment European thinkers,\nespecially those in France and Germany. While the range of European\nfigures studied by continental philosophers is too large and varied to\nlist comprehensively here, one could say that it begins with\nnineteenth century theorists such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,\nSøren Kierkegaard, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Nietzsche;\ncontinues with twentieth century thinkers such as Theodor Adorno,\nLouis Althusser, Walter Benjamin, Simone de Beauvoir, Gilles Deleuze,\nMichel Foucault, Sigmund Freud, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Martin Heidegger,\nEdmund Husserl, Jacques Lacan, Jean-François Lyotard, Herbert\nMarcuse, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jean-Paul Sartre; and extends into\nthe twenty-first century with contemporary writers such as Pierre\nBourdieu, Jacques Derrida, Jürgen Habermas, Julia Kristeva, and\nLuce Irigaray.\n\n\nSince the specific fields represented by these theorists range from\ngenealogical philosophy, phenomenology, existentialism, and critical\ntheory to deconstruction, hermeneutics, post-structuralism, and\npsychoanalytic philosophy, the label “continental” must be\nunderstood more as an umbrella concept than a precise term.\nNevertheless, contemporary continental philosophies can be seen as\nsharing a suspicion of what Lyotard (1984) has called “grand\nnarratives,” which are accounts of the world and human existence\nthat (attempt to) legitimate and provide them with meaning from a\nposition external to them. Some examples of grand narratives under\nattack by continental philosophers include the idea that facts and\nvalues are sharply opposed to one another, the assumption that the\nself is essentially unified, and the belief that the pursuit of\nknowledge is for its own sake rather than driven by particular human\ninterests. A rejection of grand narratives does not entail the\ninability to make distinctions, such as those between fact and value,\nknowledge and politics, inside and outside, and thing and process. It\ninstead means understanding those distinctions as made from a\nparticular perspective and within a particular context, and remaining\nopen to the criticism and possible rejection of them if they fail to\nserve the purposes for which they were selected. The outlook of\ncontinental philosophy thus tends to be historical and perspectival,\nemphasizing the co-constitutive relationship of subject and object,\npower and social-political location, and knowledge and truth.\n\n\nIn its perspectival, historical, and contextual approaches to\nphilosophy, continental theory finds significant points of contact not\nonly with American pragmatism, but also with much of contemporary\nfeminist philosophy. In general and especially when influenced by\ncontinental and pragmatist philosophy, feminist philosophy can be seen\nas targeting the grand narratives of patriarchy and male privilege,\narguing that many of the so-called objective and universal truths of\nphilosophy are instead pronouncements made from a\nparticular—that is, male-biased—point of view. Above all,\nas this essay will reveal, the dual impact of continental and\npragmatist philosophy contributes to a feminism that challenges the\nphilosophical construction of sharp dichotomies and opposed binaries.\nSuch a challenge is feminist because even when dualisms do not\nexplicitly refer to women, gender, or sexuality, they tend to be\nimplicated in and to produce masculine (and particularly white\nmasculine) privilege.\n\n\nIn spite of many affinities between pragmatist, continental, and\nfeminist philosophies, there have historically been few feminists\nwhose work is recognized as explicitly incorporating both of the other\ntraditions. Instead, there have been a handful of feminists well known\nfor working out of a continental tradition who also, in a less\nrecognized fashion, have drawn from pragmatist themes and figures. In\nwhat follows, we discuss five themes that emerge in the work of\nfeminists customarily associated with continental philosophy to\nilluminate the particular way that each combines pragmatist and\ncontinental thought. In the final section, we consider more recent\nwork by feminists pioneering new uses of the intersection of\ncontinental and pragmatist feminism, and suggest possible future\ndirections that the young field might take.\n\nOne of philosophy’s responses to the presence of flux and change in\nthe world has been to seek stability in the fixed and unchanging.\nAnother has been to try to rigidly order and compartmentalize that\nwhich is ambiguous or indeterminate. These quests for certainty and\npurity have been the concern of pragmatist and continental feminists\nbecause of their endorsement of traits seen as masculine and their\ncorresponding rejection of those viewed as feminine. Given western\nculture’s association of women with the impure, ambiguous, and\ndisorderly, the quest to free philosophy from those characteristics\nhas been a simultaneous attempt to flee from everything associated\nwith the feminine. \nIn The Flight to Objectivity: Essays on Cartesianism and\nCulture, Susan Bordo criticizes the “‘flight from the\nfeminine’” that has resulted from philosophy’s quests for\ncertainty and purity (1987, 118). She argues that in the wake of work\nby Richard Rorty, Michel Foucault, and feminist historians and\nphilosophers of science such as Evelyn Fox Keller and Sandra Harding,\nphilosophy cannot easily sustain its anti-cultural and non-historical\naccounts of the world. Adopting Rorty’s metaphor of “the mirror\nof nature” (1979) to criticize philosophy’s self-conception as a\nneutral reflection of what is given in the\n world,[2]\n Bordo provides a psychocultural analysis of the development of that\nmirror in the work of René Descartes. Rorty’s Nietzschean and\nDeweyan approach to philosophy understands it as a form of cultural\ntherapy, that is, as a way to improve or “cure” the\n“illnesses” of contemporary society. Similarly, The\nFlight to Objectivity brings together feminist concerns and\npsychoanalytic tools to identify western culture’s Cartesian\n“disease.” Bordo’s diagnosis is that Cartesian anxiety in\nthe face of epistemological doubt is in fact an anxiety due to\nseparation from an organic universe conceived of as female. \nTaking seriously the experiential bases of Descartes’s skepticism,\nBordo identifies the epistemological problem over which Descartes\nobsessed to be that of psychological corruption, which threatens to\nmake it impossible to know how and when to trust one’s felt sense of\nconviction when one believes something to be true. Drawing on Dewey’s\nanalysis in The Quest for Certainty (1988) and the\nanthropological work of Mary Douglas, Bordo argues that an absolutist\nquest for purity is a common response to anxiety over the messiness\nand ambiguity of the world. Moreover, she explains that the quest for\npurity during times of high cultural anxiety is correlated with an\nincrease in male social domination. As anthropologist Peggy Reeves\nSanday’s cross-cultural findings demonstrate, male domination within a\nculture tends to be at its most extreme when that culture experiences\nitself as being in too much flux (Bordo 1987, 111). For Bordo,\nDescartes’s response to historical changes such as the cultural and\nscientific revolutions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\nsuch as Martin Luther’s reformation movement and Copernicus’s\nheliocentricism, was to attempt to establish a firm division between\nconfusion and order, the impure and the pure, the ambiguous and the\ncertain, the body and the mind, and the “dirty” from the\n“clean.” Descartes thus can be thought of as the\nquintessential “dirt-rejecter” of Western philosophy\n(1987, 82). As Bordo argues, the mark of Cartesianism is not so much\nits claims to neutral objectivity as it is its “passion for\nintellectual separation, demarcation, and order” (1987,\n77). Given western culture’s long-standing\nassociation between reason, the orderly mind, and masculinity, on the\none hand, and emotions, the messy body, and femininity, on the other,\nDescartes’ rejection of flux for order was at the same time a\nprivileging of the (culturally constituted) masculine over the\n(culturally constituted) feminine. \nDewey once claimed that a felt sense of “insecurity generates\nthe quest for certainty” (Dewey 1988, 203). Following up on that\nclaim, Bordo argues that the problematic genius of Descartes was to\nfind a way to convert his anxiety in the face of the impure and\nambiguous into the confidence and certitude of objectivity. As Bordo\nexplains, “Where there is anxiety, there will almost certainly\nbe found a mechanism against that anxiety” (Bordo 1987, 75).\nDescartes took that which produced dread—the perceived\nbarrenness of a mechanistic world—and turned it into an\nadvantage, into that which makes objectivity, and thus also certainty,\npossible. In defense against the painful anxiety he felt about the\nprocess of separating from the organic whole of the universe,\nDescartes effectively declared that he willed and welcomed such a\nseparation. His defense, in other words, can be seen as a\nreaction-formation to a painful loss. Tracing the historical and\ncultural masculinization of thought and the corresponding reconception\nof nature as dead and mechanical rather than organic and alive, Bordo\ndemonstrates how what was lost was the previous cultural conception of\na “female cosmos and ‘feminine’ orientation towards\nthe world” (1987, 100). Descartes’s method of achieving absolute\ncertainty thus is as much a “flight from the feminine”\nhistorically and culturally associated with the organic and fluid, as\nit is the creation of a new epistemological criterion of and method\nfor objectivity. \nSpace is often thought of as relatively static in comparison with the\ndynamism of time. Time moves forward, we often say, while space is\ncommonly conceived as merely an empty gap that passively rests\nbetween, for example, the walls of a house or the beams of a bridge.\nWhat would it mean, however, to question this dualistic opposition of\nspace and time? What if space were also thought of as dynamic and\nmoving? And what impact would this revised conception of space have on\nphilosophical ideas about the bodies that inhabit space? As some\nfeminists have argued, rethinking spatiality as becoming, rather than\nas static being, can help philosophy rethink bodily life and\nmateriality in dynamic ways as well. Given the long-association of\nwomen with bodies and materiality, moreover, the reconceptualization\nof the latter has important implications for women and feminism. \nIn Architecture from the Outside: Essays on Virtual and Real\nSpace (2001), Elizabeth Grosz explores these conceptual questions\nabout space, time, and materiality by working in the intersections of\narchitecture and philosophy. Engaging in “conceptual or\nphilosophical [rather than concretely architectural]\nexperiments,” she forces architecture to examine the importance\nof temporality and sexuality for practices of building and making and\nattempts to render both architecture’s and philosophy’s concepts of\nspace more dynamic and fluid (2001, xviii). Grosz argues that\narchitecture is problematic from a feminist perspective because it\nlargely has ignored questions of sexual and racial differences. Not\nputting enough women’s bathrooms, relative to men’s, in concert halls,\nauditoriums, and other public buildings that draw large numbers of\npeople is one simple example of this neglect. Yet it also can be seen\nin the more complex ways that spaces are gendered and raced. How, for\nexample, does architecture contribute to raced and racist urban spaces\nby aiding the gentrified rebuilding of inner cities, a process that\ntends to displace poor, non-white populations for the benefit of\nmiddle class white people? Architecture’s neglect of questions such as\nthese is a serious matter for Grosz. Nonetheless, she argues that as a\nkind of liminal point between culture and nature, the field of\narchitecture also presents an ideal opportunity for feminists to\ntrouble many of the absolutized binary categories that often plague\nphilosophy: inside and outside, self and other, and subject and\nobject, to name just a few. It might also help philosophy “think\nof itself more humbly as a mode of producing rather than as a mode of\nknowing or intellectually grasping or mastering concepts, moving\n[philosophy] closer to everyday life and its concerns, which would be\ngood for [it]” (2001, 6). As a self-proclaimed\n“outsider” to architecture—a term used playfully\ngiven that she will smudge the lines between inside and\noutside—Grosz thus traverses the boundaries between architecture\nand philosophy to address questions of materiality and becoming that\nmight produce changes in the lived experience of spatiality. \nGrosz is interested in a philosophy that would integrate dynamic and\nproductive notions of change and time into that of space. On her view,\nsuch integration would help both architects and philosophers think of\nspace in dynamic and creative, rather than static and worn-out ways.\nAccording to Grosz, such a philosophy requires above all\n“pragmatic models” (2001, 120). With the term\n“pragmatic,” Grosz includes thinkers in both the\ntraditions of American and continental philosophy who operate with a\n“self-consciously evolutionary orientation” (2001, 169).\nThis “philosophical pragmatism meanders from Darwin, through\nNietzsche, to the work of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, Henri\nBergson, and eventually through various lines of descent, into the\ndiverging positions of Richard Rorty, on the one hand, and Gilles\nDeleuze on the other” (2001, 169). Positioning herself within\nthis lineage, Grosz affirms “pragmatist philosophers who put the\nquestions of action, practice, and movement at the center of\nontology” (2001, 169). Doing so allows them, for example, to\n“understand[d] the [inorganic] thing as question, as\nprovocation” for organic life (2001, 169).\nThis would be to take becoming and an evolutionary openness to the\nfuture various seriously for it would dare to think of the so-called\ninanimate, static thing as continuous with animate, dynamic,\norganic—including human—life. Doing so would operate with\nthe distinction between animate and inanimate in order to show their\ninteractions. It would acknowledge that the animate and the inanimate\nexist as poles on a continuum, where differences shade into one\nanother rather than stand starkly apart. \nIn questioning conventional boundaries between thing and non-thing,\nGrosz’s goal is not to completely collapse all distinctions between\nbinary categories, but rather to complicate their relationships so\nthat new possibilities might open up. Likewise, the purpose of her\nwork is not to urge the attempt to live in a world of total\nflux—as if such a thing were possible. Following James, Grosz\ninstead insists that the “teeming flux of the real” must\nbe rendered into discrete objects and that human beings are not able\nto choose not to do so (2001, 179). What she adds, however, is that\nphilosophy and architecture need to recognize that categories for\nobjectifying the world do not fully capture it in all its complex\nmultiplicity and that there is a residue that remains. This residual\nexcess is not in rigid opposition to objects and categories; rather it\nand the world of flux are continuous with the world of discrete\nobjects, in dialogue and movement with them. To think the relationship\nbetween flux and object as Grosz would have philosophers do is to\nthink the thing as she has described it: as a fluid “point of\ncrossing” rather than as a static fixity (2001, 171). \nGrosz does not often provide explicit details about how such a\n“philosophical pragmatism” might benefit feminism. Indeed,\nas she says of herself in an interview that composes chapter one of\nthe book, “I feel sure that in order to keep my feminist work\nalive I have to keep it at bay, at a bit of a distance” (2001,\n26). In the context of the entire book, however, one can understand\nher distanced feminism as another functional “outsider” to\nboth philosophy and architecture that, like all outsides, forces those\npositioned within the inside to really “think”\n(2001, 64). In the example of her own work,\nGrosz claims that she had to move away from her earlier work on the\nbody (Grosz 1994) because she had “worked to death” the\ntopic. Moving to the field of architecture has allowed her to approach\nthe question of materiality in a fresh way (2001, 26). Making that\nmove, Grosz offers feminists an example of how to get some distance\nfrom and thus gain a new perspective on familiar feminist concepts so\nthat fresh insight into them is possible. Grosz thus provisionally\npreserves the distinctions between continental and pragmatist\nphilosophy, architecture, and feminism in order to enable the\n“infection by one side of the border of the other [and] a\nbecoming otherwise of each of the terms thus bounded” (2001,\n65). \nTechnology and science have had and continue to have an enormous\nimpact on the contemporary world. The weapons, medicines, automobiles,\nelectronics, and other goods they produce have been both beneficial to\nand problematic for human and non-human animal life. Important to\nunderstanding the particular impact of technology and science is to\nfocus not just on their products, however, but also on the processes\nby which those products come into existence—and, moreover, not\nonly the mechanical, but also the social processes as well. The\nproducts of contemporary technoscience are hybrid compilations of\nmaterial goods, human labor, and social relations that often are\noppressive. As such, they cannot be understood if they are conceived\nof as mere things, abstracted away from their social contexts. Doing\nso interferes with the ability to ask questions about whom\ntechnoscience benefits and whom it exploits or otherwise harms. \nMuch of Donna Haraway’s work stresses the importance of asking these\nquestions. In Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of\nNature (1991), Donna Haraway introduces the figure of the cyborg,\nan “impure” creature who scrambles orderly divisions\nbetween the natural and artificial/technical, and the human and the\nnon-human/animal. Continuing her exploration of “ontological\nconfusing bodies” in\nModest_Witness@Second_Millennium.FemaleMan©_Meets_\n\nOncoMouse™: Feminism and\nTechnoscience (1997, 186), Haraway speaks as a cyborgian\n“modest witness” to contemporary technoscience, at once\nboth implicated in and suspicious of its processes and products.\nExtending her earlier insights into how humans “polish an animal\nmirror to look for ourselves” (1991, 22), Haraway criticizes the\nway that science takes nature as a static given, congealing and\nobscuring social relations such that they can be taken as\ndecontextualized things-in-themselves. (It should be noted, however,\nthat other feminists have taken issue with Haraway’s characterization\nof science. Mary Magada-Ward (2014) in particular has argued from a\npragmatic feminist perspective that Haraway’s willingness to criticize\nscience as one narrative among others is irresponsible, and endangers\nthe very liberatory projects with which feminists are aligned.)  \nFor Haraway, Western culture is extremely fetishistic, mistaking\n“a fixed thing for the doings of power-differentiated lively\nbeings” (1997, 135). To analyze the web of economic,\npsychological, and philosophical threads that compose this fetishism,\nHaraway appeals to the work of Marx, Freud, and Whitehead.\nEconomically, socio-technological relations often are taken to be\ncommodities whose value is intrinsic rather than the product of the\nlabor and practices of organic life. Hand-in-hand with this\npolitico-economic fetishism goes a psychological denial of this\nsubstitution that makes the “mistake” of taking things for\nprocesses very difficult to recognize. Finally, wound up with these\ntwo strands is the philosophical error that misunderstands concrete,\nrelational processes as fixed, simple abstractions (1997, 147). All\nthree threads of this fetishism are bound up in, for example, the\ncomputer chip, which is incredibly valuable and necessary to late\ncapitalist, technological society. Locating its value in pieces of\nmetal and plastic and electronic codes, however, we lose sight of the\nhistorical and labor processes that produce and sustain the computer’s\nexistence. A product of World War II, the computer was developed to\nhelp calculate artillery trajectories so that bombs would be more\neffective (read: destroy more property and kill more people). Today,\ncomputer chips and mother boards often are produced by Asian women in\nthe U.S. and various third-world countries, who are seen as especially\nappropriate for such jobs because of their “Oriental”\nnimble finger work and attentiveness to small details (1991, 154,\n177). When we fetishize the chip, we are incapable of seeing this\n“final appropriation of women’s bodies in a masculinist orgy of\nwar” (1991, 154). That is to say, we render ourselves incapable\nof understanding how the materials, processes, and concerns of a\nhighly militarized, technoscientific culture shape the world and our\nvery selves. \nThe process philosophy of Whitehead subtly provides crucial support\nfor Haraway’s analysis of fetishism and, indeed, much of her critique\nof technoscience. As Haraway explains in a footnote to\nModest_Witness (1997, 297n21), Whitehead has been important\nto her work since at least her days as a graduate student, and she\nbelieves that the general thrust of his ideas can be discerned in a\ngreat deal of feminist science studies and philosophy of science. For\nWhitehead, everything in the world is a “concrescence of\nprehensions,” prehensions being the grasping or feeling of one\nthing by another in their on-going relations of becoming (1997, 47). A\nconcrescence of prehensions, then, is a growing together of processes\nof becoming that allows some relations to function as a unified,\ndistinct thing, or “actual entity.” What Whitehead calls\nthe fallacy of misplaced concreteness occurs when abstract logical\nconstructions—such as the notion of a thing’s primary qualities\nor of its simple location in space-time—are (mis)taken for the\nconcreteness of processual, actual entities. The effect of this\nmistake, in Haraway’s terms, is the fetishization of things. Allying\nherself with Whitehead, Haraway emphasizes the prehensional\n“reachings into each other in the tissues of the world”\n(1997, 147)—for example, genes, computer chips, fetuses,\nOncoMouse™—that are the concrete, actual materials of\nWestern technoscience. \nAlthough she argues against fetishism, it would be misleading to\nconclude that Haraway is thus also arguing “for” the\nontologically messy hybridity that results when one gives fetishism\nup. Neither, however, is Haraway “against” hybridity. Both\nof these positions are too categorical for the issue at hand. In\nHaraway’s view, hybridity presents possible dangers and potential\nbenefits alike and thus must be examined in its various\nparticularities. Haraway’s task, thus, is to pragmatically ask,\n“for whom and how [do] these hybrids work?” (1997, 280 n1)\nWho benefits, for example, from OncoMouse™, the mouse with human\ngenes for developing breast cancer that has been developed and\ntrademarked by DuPont? This question not only points to the issue of\nhuman beings’ taking “noninnocent responsibility” for the\nuse of non-human animals as research tools (1997, 82). It also points\nto questions about environmental toxins, environmental racism, and the\navailability and affordability of health care for African American\nwomen in light of their increasing death rates from cancer while those\nof white women remain the same (1997, 113). Asking questions such as\nthese would help enable contemporary technoscience to engage in\npractices of “witnessing,” that is to “stan[d]\npublically accountable for, and psychically vulnerable to [its]\nvisions and representations” (1997, 267). For Haraway, such\naccountability would open up the possibility that technosciences\n“knowledge products” might at the same time be\n“freedom projects” as well (1997, 269). \nIn 1949, Simone de Beauvoir famously claimed that “[o]ne is not\nborn, but rather becomes, a woman” (Beauvoir 1989, 267).\nContemporary pragmatist feminist and continental feminist philosophers\ngenerally agree with this claim, rejecting the notion that the\ncategory of woman (and man) and the conception of femininity (and\nmasculinity) are simply given in nature. As a result, some have\nexplored the role of social institutions—such as the media, the\nwork place, and education—in creating the particular type of\ngendered, sexual subject called “woman.” Others have\nfocused on the inner mechanisms of this process, so to speak, asking\nhow the unconscious desires of women are constituted such that their\npsychical lives contribute to their gender and sexuality. These two\napproaches need not be seen as antithetical, however. An understanding\nof how women are constituted as sexual subjects is perhaps best\nachieved by exploring the intersection of the social\n“outside” and the psychical “inside” in the\nformation of subjectivity. \nTeresa De Lauretis’s work takes this intersectional approach, allying\nfeminism, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and film criticism to explore the\nformation of women’s subjectivity and desire in relation to social and\nmaterial reality. In Alice Doesn’t: Feminism, Semiotics,\nCinema (1984), de Lauretis develops the concept of experience as\na process by which the subject is semiotically and historically\nconstructed, arguing that one becomes a woman in and through the\npractice of signs in which women live. In The Practice of Love:\nLesbian Sexuality and Perverse Desire (1994), she continues her\nexploration of these issues by focusing specifically on\n“perverse” formations of sexuality, by which she means\nforms of sexuality that challenge normative heterosexuality and\nespecially lesbian sexuality. In each of these books, de Lauretis\ndraws on the pragmatist semiosis of Peirce to explore the dynamic\njuncture between “inner” and “outer” worlds,\nprivate and public fantasies, and individual experience and social\nmeaning, especially as they construct sexual subjects. \nSemiotics is a term created by Peirce to “designate[s] the\nprocess by which a culture produces signs and/or attributes meanings\nof signs” (de Lauretis 1984, 167). Semiotics thus is a theory of\nhow meaning is created through processes of interpretation. These\nprocesses are so important to Peirce that he goes so far as to claim,\n“my language is the sum total of myself; for the man [sic] is\nthe thought” (Peirce 2000a, 67). This is not a reduction of the\nhuman to a narrowly construed language, however. Rather, the claim is\nthat to understand who or what a person is, one must understand the\nprocesses of interpretation in which she and her various communities\nare engaged. This last point helps brings out the particularly\npragmatist aspect of Peirce’s semiotics. For Peirce, the semiotic\nprocesses that constitute the individual are always grounded in\ncommunity, history, and materiality. To understand the interpretative\nconstitution of the self, one must understand the various\n“external” environments that contribute to it. \nAccording to de Lauretis, an important reason to turn to Peirce is\nprecisely that his theory returns body and history to the subject of\n semiosis.[3]\n For Peirce, semiosis is an unlimited process, but that does not mean\nthat it is an infinite regression of signs merely circulating back on\nthemselves. Rather, as de Lauretis explains, in their address to\nsomeone—and for Peirce, because they are inherently communal,\nsigns always address someone—signs create other signs that are\nthe “significate effects” of the first signs. Peirce calls\nthese sign-effects “interpretants,” and the particular\ntype of interpretant that interests de Lauretis is the one that Peirce\ncalls “logical” because it takes up or makes sense of the\nemotion and energy of the other type of interpretants. The logical\ninterpretant is a modification of a person’s habits,\n“habit” used pragmatically by Peirce to mean a tendency or\ndisposition to a certain manner or style of acting. Thus for Peirce,\nalthough unlimited, semiosis nevertheless always results in the\ntemporary “resting places” of one’s habits of acting and\nthinking—“temporary” because a person’s modified\nhabits will contribute to the production of new signs, which will then\nfeed into the on-going process of meaning-creation that will yet again\nmodify subjects by producing additional habit changes. Thus on\nPeirce’s account—and this is of utmost importance to de\nLauretis—signs have their effect in historical, bodily matter\nand are not narrowly linguistic. \nDe Lauretis faults Julia Kristeva for operating with just such a\nnarrow (mis)understanding of the semiotic subject (1984,\n 171).[4]\n Representing one trend of poststructuralist semiotic theory for de\nLauretis, Kristeva’s approach is at once valuable because of its\npsychoanalytic appreciation of the body and the unconscious, and\nproblematic because of its narrow understanding of linguistics and\nthus its neglect of the social aspects of meaning-creation. The other\ntrend of postructuralist semiotic theory, represented by Umberto Eco,\nappreciates the social side of semiosis but omits exactly what\npsychoanalysis includes: the non-conscious elements of human\nexistence. A similar division, and thus a similar set of problems, can\nbe found between the work of Freud and Foucault, according to de\nLauretis. In his focus on sexuality, Freud offers a “privatized\nview of the internal world of the psyche” while Foucault’s\naccount of sexuality is “eminently social” (1994,\nxix–xx). Thus, for de Lauretis, feminists who seek to understand\nthe semiotic creation of sexual subjects are presented with a\nproblematic choice built on an exclusive binary: either the sexual\nsubject is socially constituted but lacks a psychic interior (Eco and\nFoucault) or the sexual subject has psychic depth but lacks rich\nconnections with the world external to it (Kristeva and Freud). \nPeirce’s advantage is that he attends to both sides of the\ninternal-external divide, furnishing “the link between semiosis\nand reality, between signification and concrete action” (1984,\n175). And yet, for de Lauretis, Peirce’s work is not sufficient by\nitself because it lacks a well-developed notion of the unconscious.\nThus de Lauretis’s self-appointed task is to negotiate the problems\nand promises of all these approaches by means of a pragmatist\nsemiotics, creating a “theoretical overlap” (1984, 168)\nbetween Kristeva’s internalist and Eco’s externalist semiotics, as\nwell as between Freud’s privatized and Foucault’s social sexual\nsubject. Put another way, de Lauretis joins Freud with\nPeirce—admittedly “even stranger bedfellows than Marx and\nFreud” (1984, 215 n31)—to explore how the semiotic\njunction between psychic interior and social exterior produces the\nunconscious habits that create sexual subjects. \nIn some of her most recent work (2000), de Lauretis makes clear that\nalthough semiosis is ongoing and although the habits it produces are\nalways open to future changes, habit-change is not necessarily or\nalways for the better nor can it easily (if at all) be controlled. In\ndialogue with Vincent Colapietro (2000) on how to understand Peirce’s\nlogical interpretant, de Lauretis argues that it is very difficult, if\nnot impossible, to deliberately direct the significate effects of\nsemiosis. In her view here—which appears to diverge somewhat\nfrom her earlier emphasis on Foucault’s concepts of self-analysis and\nself-exercise as Peircean “‘deliberately formed,\nself-analyzing habit[s]’” (Peirce quoted in de Lauretis\n1994, 312)—the juncture of psyche and social that takes root in\nunconscious habits is not amenable to conscious efforts to transform\nit. Rather than being deliberate and reflective, changes to habit tend\nto be random (at least from the point of rational consciousness) and\nare relentlessly subject to all sorts of deformations, compulsions,\nand other neurotic symptoms (2000, 172–73). The semiotic\nconstruction of sexual subjects thus can be seen as perverse not only\nin that it can defy heterosexual conventions but also in that it\nresists the efforts of self-knowledge and self-directed\ntransformation. \nLike gender and sexuality, race is a social-material category that is\nnot simply given in nature. Scholars continue to debate precisely when\nmodern notions of race were created, but since at least the late\neighteenth century, general patterns of white privilege and supremacy\nand the domination of non-white people have existed. Given the\noppressive origins of the concept of race and of whiteness in\nparticular, it might seem that racial identity should be eliminated in\nthe name of eliminating racism. And given that no definitive\nbiological or genetic basis for dividing the human population into\ndiscreet racial groups exists, it might seem easy to eliminate racial\nidentity since it is not real in the ways that it popularly is thought\nto be. But racial identities have a lived reality to them that is not\ndependent on scientific categorizations. Their lived reality not only\nmakes it difficult to eliminate racial identities; it also makes it\nproblematic to unequivocally call for their abolition since their\nelimination could mean the loss of an important source of meaning in\none’s life. \nLinda Martín Alcoff warns feminists and others of this\npotential loss, arguing that the reasons for eliminating class and\nstatus differences do not necessarily apply to racial and other social\nidentities. In Visible Identities: Race, Gender, and the Self\n(2006), she examines race and gender as historical-material formations\nthat are fundamental, rather than peripheral to the self. Analyzing\nphilosophical and political critiques of identity politics, Alcoff\nexplains how identity claims have become suspect because they are seen\nas necessarily divisive, exclusionary, and alienating. Appeals to\nracial and/or gender identities by Latinas, for example, allegedly are\npolitically problematic because they intensify conflict between groups\nand thus are destructive to larger communities or nations (2006, 36).\nAnd they allegedly are philosophically problematic because they\nalienate a person from herself by means of an oppressive and\nartificially imposed category or set of categories (2006, 80). Genuine\nfreedom and authenticity thus would seem to require the abandonment of\nsocial identities. \nAccording to Alcoff, however, hidden behind these attacks on identity\nis a closet individualism that mistrusts any form of sociality or\ncommunity and fears any influence of the Other on the self. “Why\nassume that if I am culturally, ethnically, sexually identifiable that\nthis is a process akin to Kafka’s nightmarish torture machines in the\npenal colony?” asks Alcoff (2006, 81). The answer is that\n“identity in any form [is seen by its critics as] foisted on the\nself from the outside by the Other” (2006, 81). For the\nindividual who insists on his or her absolute independence, social\nidentities represent a loss of control and power through ontological\ndependency upon someone other than oneself. This loss of power is to\nbe feared, and so too then are racial and other social identities to\nbe resisted. \nAlcoff’s responds to this fear by situating it as a very particular,\nrather than universal need to deflect the Other, one felt by\ncolonizers and other dominant groups who do not want to see themselves\nreflected in their victims’ eyes (2006, 81). Antagonism and resistance\nare not the only forms that relationships between self and other can\ntake. The interdependency of self and other can be recognized in such\na way that “the Other’s view of me—that is, my identity in\nthe Other’s presence—is internalized and thus is constitutive of\nmy self” (2006, 82). Drawing on the hermeneutics of Hans-Georg\nGadamer and the pragmatism of George Herbert Mead, Alcoff develops a\nconcept of social identity that constitutively situates the individual\nin a communal world. Social identities are not forced onto atomistic\nindividuals who then necessarily become alien to themselves. Racial\nand other identities are, borrowing from Gadamer, “hermeneutic\nhorizons comprised of experiences, basic beliefs, and communal values,\nall of which influence our orientation toward and responses to future\nexperiences” (2006, 287). Or in Mead’s terms, the self is formed\nin and through the context of the “generalized other,”\nwhich is a communal perspective by and through which an individual\ndevelops self-consciousness and thereby learns to perceive both\nherself and others (2006, 117). The hermeneutic notion of horizon\nallows feminists and others to appreciate how race and gender are real\nin that they are lived positions in which individual meaning is\ncreated in relationship to history and experience. An individual\nalways operates within specific horizons, but because horizons open\nout to indeterminacy, a range of interpretative meaning is available\nfrom within those horizons (2006, 43). And Mead’s account of the\nsocial self enhances the notion of horizon by emphasizing its social\ndimensions (2006, 121). The horizon in and through which individual\nmeaning is created is always a world of shared meaning that helps\nconstitute an individual’s self-consciousness and experience. \nFor Alcoff, raced, gendered, and other social identities can be\noppressive, but they are not inherently or necessarily so. The\nultimate question, in her view, “is not how to overcome\nidentity, but how to transform our current interpretations and\nunderstandings of [it]” (Alcoff 2006, 287). Shannon Sullivan\nasks a similar question about whiteness in Revealing Whiteness:\nThe Unconscious Habits of Racial Privilege (2006). According to\nSullivan, white privilege increasingly operates in the form of\nunconscious habit, able to thrive in a world that generally frowns on\novert racism because that racism seems non-existent. With pragmatists\nW.E.B. Du Bois and John Dewey, Sullivan develops an account of\nwhiteness as a raced and racist habit that is constitutive of the self\nand formed through transaction with a raced and racist world. Habit as\nsuch is not a problem to be solved although some habits, such as white\nprivilege and domination, can be very harmful. For Sullivan, as a\nstyle or predisposition for engaging with/in the world, habit is\nsimultaneously malleable and durable, which means that habits can be\ntransformed but that such transformation tends to take a long\ntime. \nThis especially true in the case of habits of white privilege, given\ntheir increasingly unconscious operations. Developing a pragmatized\nnotion of the unconscious—one that is sympathetic to de\nLauretis’s work on Peirce and Freud—Sullivan explains the\nunconscious as formed through transaction with its various social,\npolitical, material and other environments (2006, 47). Drawing on the\npsychoanalytic theory of Jean Laplanche, Sullivan also modifies the\npragmatist concept of habit to account for the ways that habits of\nwhiteness “often are deviously obstructionist, actively blocking\nthe self’s attempts to transform itself for the better” (2006,\n44). Racist habits of whiteness can be changed, but only indirectly,\nthrough changes to the environments that help constitute those habits.\nAs Sullivan (2006, 10) argues, “relocating out of geographical,\nliterary, political, and other environments that encourage the white\nsolipsism of living as if only white people existed or mattered can be\na powerful way of disrupting and transforming unconscious habits of\nwhite privilege.” And yet even here a word of warning is in\norder, according to Sullivan. Habits of white privilege can and often\ncontinue to operate in the midst of the best intentions to undermine\nthem through control of one’s environments. Since habits of white\nprivilege tend to be characterized by “ontological\nexpansiveness,” in which white people treat all spaces as\nrightfully inhabited by them, attempts to master one’s environment in\nthe name of anti-racist struggle simultaneously can be a reinforcement\nof that privilege (2006, 144). Sullivan thus cautions that although\nstruggles to eliminate white privilege must continue, habits of racial\nprivilege will not quickly or easily be eliminated. \nCompared to continental feminism, pragmatist feminism is a small\n field.[5]\n It is growing, however, and as it does so, the chances that more work\non the intersections of feminism, pragmatism, and continental\nphilosophy will be produced also increase. To date, one common thread\nthat loosely unites feminist cross-fertilizations of continental and\npragmatist philosophy is its criticism of oppositional, exclusionary\nbinaries; another is a commitment to philosophical work that engages\nwith lived experience and everyday life. In this closing section, we\noutline possible avenues for future work in pragmatist and continental\nfeminism, and highlight recent developments in the field. \nFor over two decades, understanding the relationship between\nembodiment and gender, race, and sexuality has been an important topic\nfor continental feminists, especially Susan Bordo (1993), Judith\nButler (1990 and 1994), Elizabeth Grosz (1994), and Gail Weiss (1999).\nIn Living Across and Through Skins: Transactional Bodies,\nPragmatism and Feminism (2001), Shannon Sullivan engages Butler’s\nand (to a lesser degree) Bordo’s work, along with that of\nMerleau-Ponty, Nietzsche, and Dewey, to argue for a feminist\nconception of bodily life as transactional. Sullivan presents bodies\nas dynamically constituted in and through relationships with their\npolitical, social, material, and other environments, and she does so\nfor the purpose of exploring which bodies transactional processes\nbenefit and harm and thus whether those processes should be embraced\nor transformed by feminists and others. \nLadelle McWhorter’s Bodies and Pleasures: Foucault and the\nPolitics of Sexual Normalization (1999) does not explicitly\nappeal to pragmatist philosophy, but its affinities with pragmatist\nmethods and concerns can be drawn out. McWhorter argues that the value\nof Foucault’s philosophy should not be judged by the truth (or\nfalsity) of what it says, a method of evaluation that relies upon what\nRorty (1979) calls “the mirror of nature.” In its place,\nMcWhorter asks feminist and other readers of Foucault to pragmatically\njudge his work on what it does, that is, on the transformative impact\nthat it has on their lives. Using her own life as a text, McWhorter\n“takes an experience of reading Foucault’s works as [her] point\nof analysis” (1999, xix) and demonstrates the feminist-friendly\neffects of Foucault’s particular account of bodies, pleasures, and the\nformation of sexual subjects. \nFoucault also is the focal point of Cressida J. Heyes’s\nSelf-Transformations: Foucault, Ethics, and Normalized Bodies\n(2007). As Heyes asks with Foucault how growth in a\nperson’s capacities can be separated from increased docility\nwithin power relations, she draws on Richard Shusterman’s\npragmatist somaesthetics. A bodily discipline that both critically\nstudies and uses sensory-aesthetic appreciation to improve lived\nexperience, somaesthetics can be a point of\n“counterattack” (2007, 123) that helps a person care for\nher embodied self in ways that increase her freedom. It does this by\nteaching non-normative ways of experiencing and evaluating one’s\nbodily experiences, increasing the capacity of what one can think and\ndo. Through her concrete examples of yoga and other bodily practices,\nHeyes draws on continental and pragmatist philosophy to take “a\nfirst step toward creating grander feminist projects from existing\nsomaesthetic practices” (2007, 136). \nMarjorie Jolles, in contrast, doubts that Shusterman’s\npragmatism can provide the critical counterpoint to bodily\nnormalization that both Foucault and feminist philosophy need. This is\nbecause bodily experience is shaped by the very normalizing forces\nthat it is supposed to challenge. Responding to Heyes in “Between\nEmbodied Subjects and Objects: Narrative Somaesthetics” (2012), Jolles\nargues that “Shusterman does not go far enough in establishing\nsomaesthetics’ suitability of Foucauldian feminist efforts to\nshape one’s life” in anti- and non-normative ways (2012,\n307). Proposing an alternative to Shusterman’s somaesthetics,\nJolles develops what she calls narrative somaesthetics. Modeled on\nfeminist consciousness-raising, narrative somaesthetics incorporates\ninto somatic practices narrative work that helps disrupt\nnormalization. On Jolles’s view, by combining discursive and bodily\npractices, feminist philosophy will have a better shot at countering\nthe harmful somatic effects of sexist oppression. \nPragmatist resources for thinking about embodiment also is the subject\nof Maurice Hamington’s (2004) Embodied Care: Jane Addams, Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty, and Feminist Ethics. In that book, Hamington\nargues that human bodies are built for care and that care can only be\nunderstood properly in conjunction with its embodied dimensions.\nDistinguishing care—a contextual, corporeal, interdependent way\nof being in the world—from the theory of care ethics, Hamington\nintersects Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of bodily habits with\nAmerican pragmatist Jane Addams’ embodied practices of democracy and\ncitizenship to demonstrate the body’s centrality to feminist ethics.\nDeveloping the concepts of caring habits, caring knowledge, and caring\nimagination, Hamington affirms Jane Addams’ “simple yet powerful\nmandate that we boldly experience one another” through our\nembodied practices of care (2004, 145). \nFinally, some feminists emphasize the practical value of\nphenomenological and pragmatic accounts of embodiment and the self for\nsolving specific problems in the real world. Jennifer Hansen, for\nexample, in her contributions to the philosophy of psychiatry, has\nemphasized the therapeutic value of a conception of the habitual body\nand the narrative self for the treatment of individuals with bipolar\ndisorder. Though such individuals may experience self-distrust as a\nresult of difficulty with seeing themselves “as consistent\nagents” (2013, 69) brought on by challenges with identifying with\ntheir past actions in either manic or depressive states, Hansen argues\nthat clinicians can assist patients build a coherent sense of self by\nincorporating insights about habitual embodiment. Drawing on Grosz and\nIris M. Young’s (2005) feminist phenomenology, as well as James’s\naccount of habit as central to embodied selfhood, Hansen suggests that\nthe habitual body’s capacity to engage with the world in consistent,\ngoal-directed ways, despite doing so unconsciously, provides an\ninroad to a self-concept that is coherent. Although such habitual\nmoments (of, for example, opening familiar doors or performing special\nlearned skills like CPR) are often performed unconsciously, we can\nbegin to notice and appreciate them “if others, such as a clinician,\npoints them out to us” (2013, 72.) Although such recognition may seem\na small step, they could be useful as patients begin to cultivate\nself-trust. Clinicians, moreover, may assist patients in recognizing\nthat even seemingly rudimentary habits have significance in creating a\nsense of self: “Although the habitual body of a bipolar patient may\nnot have a habitual moral character, she may, for example, have a\nhabit of recycling” (72). The recognition of such habits could be\nbeneficial in beginning to build self-trust. Traditional views of\npsychiatry may view individuals with bipolar disorder as incapable of\n“coherent” selfhood in the ordinary sense of the word, but Hansen\nshows that feminist phenomenological and pragmatic “accounts of\nembodiment show another way in which bipolar selves can be coherent:\nthey cohere in habitual bodies” (73). \nThe concept of the Other offers a potential site for productive\ndiscussion and disagreement between feminist, pragmatist, and\ncontinental philosophers. As Charlene Haddock Seigfried notes,\n“[p]ragmatists tend to celebrate otherness by seeking out and\nwelcoming difference as an expression of creative subjectivity”\n(1996, 267). The optimistic tone that pragmatism often takes toward\nalterity is markedly different from that of Julia Kristeva’s claim\nthat one is always other to oneself: “Foreigner: a choked up\nrage deep down in my throat. By recognizing him within ourselves, we\nare spared detesting him in himself” (1991, 1). Contemporary\npragmatist feminists have tended to be more skeptical than most\ncanonical pragmatists of the category of the Other because they\nrecognize it as a means of domination. Yet, influenced by pragmatism,\nthose feminists tend not to construe the Other in as alienating and\nforeboding way as Kristeva does. Pragmatist and continental philosophy\nthus presents feminists with a variety of resources for thinking\nthrough the benefits and dangers of different conceptions of the\nOther, including the role of the Other in the constitution of both\nself and community. \nCynthia Gayman (2011) and Erin C. Tarver (2013), for example, have\nargued that women’s constitution as subjects in a social milieu of\noppressive gender relations ironically opens the possibility for\nchange and subversion. Tarver’s argument proceeds by bringing a\nDeweyan account of habit to bear on Judith Butler’s theory of gender\nas performative, whereas Gayman puts Dewey in dialog with Foucault.\nSpecifically, Gayman combines a Foucaultian account of the gendered\nsubject with a Deweyan insistence that critical investigation happens\n“by recognition of a problem, which in turn provokes the kind of\nreflexive activity leading to recognition that what is, does not have\nto be” (2011, 67). Because the individual is constituted through her\ninteractions and transactions with others in the world, the\nrecognition of problems necessarily occurs through everyday\nexperiences and interactions. It is not that others are themselves\nproblems; rather, the encounters in our world that cause us to stumble\nprovoke us to ask questions about how to proceed. They, as Gayman puts\nit following Foucault and Colin Koopman (2011), provoke a\n“problematization” (67). Thus, for Gayman, although patterns of gender\nsubordination that women encounter as they become subjects in and\nthrough interaction with others in the social world must be resisted,\n“to be resisted they must be seen, that is, recognized in the first\nplace, which means they must be  experienced , as well as \nproblematized” (75). Encounter with the other, which happens\nnecessarily through experience, is therefore necessary for the\ndevelopment of feminist consciousness.  \nIn psychoanalytic terms, the imaginary is the collection of (largely)\nunconscious fantasies and images that shapes both individual subjects\nand their worlds. In different ways, the work of both Donna Haraway\nand Luce Irigaray seeks to reveal the male privilege and domination\ncontained within the current imaginary so that a space for a different\nsort of imaginary might be opened for the future. Although Irigaray is\nthe better known for it, both she and Haraway appropriate the image of\nthe speculum in this process, appealing to the gynecological mirror as\nan “instrument for rendering a part accessible to\nobservation” (Haraway 1997, 197) and revealing how the feminine\ninstrument is not itself reflected in its work of mirroring others\n(Irigaray 1985). While Haraway “excavate[s] something like a\ntechnoscientific unconscious” (1997, 151), Irigaray investigates\nthe psychoanalytic “science that still cannot make up its\nmind” about “woman, science’s unknown” (1985, 15,\n13). Their work thus offers interesting resources for uncovering a\npatriarchal culture’s blind spots and transforming its unconscious\nimaginary, as well as raises important questions about the role that\nscience can or should play in feminist theorizing of the\n future.[6] \nNoëlle McAfee also draws on psychoanalytic theory to analyze the\nunconscious operations of democratic societies. In Democracy and\nthe Political Unconscious (2008), McAfee blends poststructural\npsychoanalysis, feminist philosophy, and semiotics with Deweyan,\nRawlsian, and Habermasian democratic theories. The result is a\nsophisticated argument that when some members of a society are denied\nthe ability to participate in the public sphere, that society will\ntend to develop a political unconscious. As McAfee explains, the\npolitical unconscious is not a thing or a place, but rather “an\neffect of processes: failures to sublimate well, desires\nunarticulated, voices kept silent, repressions reenacted without\nacknowledgement of their origins” (2008, 12). Understanding with Dewey that the public is called into\nbeing by particular problems and that it can have difficulty finding\nitself when those problems are immense, McAfee develops democratic\nstrategies for public processes of mourning so that age-old traumas of\nrepression and exclusion no longer are compulsively repeated. \nLike McAfee, José Medina draws on several thinkers in both the\ncontinental and pragmatist traditions to argue for a feminist response\nto oppressive socio-political conditions. Unlike McAfee, however,\nMedina conceives the project of resistance to oppression as\nfundamentally epistemological in nature. The reason for this is that,\nas he argues in The Epistemology of Resistance (2013), while\ndemocratic practice requires collective engagement, “in contexts of\nsexual and racial oppression there are cognitive-affective deficits\nthat amount to specific forms of epistemic insensitivity: the\ninability to listen to and learn from others, the inability to call\ninto question one’s perspective and to process epistemic friction\nexerted from significantly different perspectives” (2013, 17–18). Such\ndeficits undermine the possibility of genuine democratic engagement\nand prevent the privileged in particular of recognizing the\nsocio-political injustices in which they are complicit. However,\nMedina’s epistemological project is both critical and constructive.\nDrawing especially on the work of Foucault and James, he articulates a\nvision of the epistemological practices we must take up in order to\nresist oppression, for “epistemic and sociopolitical melioration\ngo hand in hand” (301).  \nMedina argues that knowers have a “shared responsibility with respect\nto epistemic justice for the correction of blind spots and social\ninsensitivities associated with racism and (hetero)sexism” (2013, 25),\nsuggesting that those subjects whose privilege prevents them from\ndeveloping knowledge of or sensitivity to experiences beyond their own\nhave an obligation to unsettle their epistemic ease by seeking out\n“epistemic friction” and “cultivat[ing] a resistant imagination” (26) that\nwould sensitize them to the experiences of marginalized and\nstigmatized subjects. The prescription that Medina offers for\naccomplishing such cultivation, which he terms “guerilla pluralism”\n(284), is inspired by a combination of insights from Foucault and\nJames. Both Foucault and James conceive truth and knowledge as plural\nand as the product of particular interests and purposes. One of the\nkey ways in which they differ, however, is in the implications of this\nview of knowledge that they emphasize: whereas James offers a\n“melioristic pluralism,” in which epistemic contestations and\nnegotiations are directed toward improving the objectivity of the\ndifferent standpoints available, toward correcting their biases and\nmistakes, and toward “maintain[ing] their truth alive” (283),\nFoucault’s genealogical approach offers a less rosy view of the\npossibilities of epistemic melioration, and aims less at learning than\nunlearning received ways of viewing the world. Foucault, then, would\nhave us “resurrect counter-memories, not just for the sake of joint\ncooperation, but for the sake of reactivating struggles and energizing\nforms of resistance” (284). Drawing from Foucault the importance of\nspecific mechanisms to break down settled regimes of power/knowledge\nand from James the imperative to find a way to move forward in\nimproving the social conditions in which we live, Medina advocates the\nformation of a resistant social imagination through genealogical\ninvestigations: “genealogical investigations constitute critical\ninterventions in the social imagination that can help us make our\nsense of a shared past more pluralistic and open to diversity” (292).\nThis is not to say, however, that the end point of such investigations\nwill be the total overcoming of oppression or even of culpable shared\nignorance. Rather, in a pragmatic vein, Medina emphasizes a\nfallibilist approach to investigation that remains open to correction\nand critique through “radical solidarity: the cultivation of an\never-expanding accountability and responsiveness to indefinitely many\nothers, which is required by a resistant epistemic agency” (302). Such\nfallibilism, unlike radical relativism in which “any way of framing\nand interpreting is as good as any other,” is committed to producing a\nresistant imagination characterized by its exertion of “beneficial\nepistemic friction” (303) that is aimed at continual self-correction\nand resistance to oppression and the ignorance that necessarily\naccompanies it. \nCelia T. Bardwell-Jones (2018) makes use of Medina’s epistemology of\nresistance to theorize the conflict between hospital administrators\nand Native Hawaiian mothers in policies regarding the treatment of the\nplacenta after hospital births in Hawai’i. Before 2006, as\nBardwell-Jones explains, hospitals regarded the placenta as hazardous\nhuman waste, which needed to be disposed of as a threat to public\nhealth. This put hospital policy in direct conflict with Native\nHawaiian practice, which required burying the placenta in a ceremony\nafter birth, as a means of affirming the connection of the infant with\nthe environment and community from which they came. Because of the\nlasting legacy of colonialism in Hawai’i, this conflict was\nunhelpfully framed as a conflict between “modern” and\n“traditional” views of health (which, as Bardwell points\nout, ignores the fact that many Native Hawaiian mothers do in fact\nvalue modern hospitals and choose to give birth in them). The dominant\nbiomedical view that barred taking home the placenta, moreover, relied\n“on an assumption of epistemological superiority”\n(106). Following Medina, Bardwell-Jones argues that this biomedical\napproach’s privileged position left it epistemically insensitive to\nNative Hawaiian knowledges about the moral value of a sense of place\nand community. To overcome such insensitivities, she suggests,\nhospital administrators should do as Medina says and aim to cultivate\nepistemic friction—or, as she puts its, “perplexity”\n(107)—by seeking out genuine engagement with differentially\nsituated others. Doing so is useful not only for the purpose of\nadequately serving the community in which the hospital is located, but\nalso for beginning to recognize when existing health care policy is in\nfact “informed by a state of moral panic” (110) that can\nsurround public health discussions, but of which the medical\nestablishment may very well be unaware. \nThe expansion of the canon of “classical” American\nphilosophy to include more than white men opens up new possibilities\nfor feminist intersections of continental and pragmatist philosophy.\nCynthia Willett’s The Soul of Justice: Social Bonds and Racial\nHubris (2001) is a good example of one such possibility. In this\nbook, Willett critically intersects G.W.F. Hegel and Luce Irigaray\n(among others) with the “visionary pragmatism” (2001, 175)\nof African-American thinkers such as Toni Morrison and Patricia Hill\nCollins to present an account of freedom based in social bonds.\nRejecting modernity’s and psychoanalysis’s account of separation as\ncrucial to the formation of subjectivity, Willet draws on accounts of\nslavery to show how the destruction of erotic connections through the\nviolence of separation results in social death. With this account,\nWillett suggests how an expanded understanding of American pragmatism\nthat includes black women can combine with continental philosophy to\nproduce a feminist and anti-racist liberatory theory that appreciates\nthe constitutive role that desire plays in social relationships. In\nrecent years, additionally, Collins (2012; 2019) herself has written\non the value of an explicit dialogue between intersectionality theory\nfounded by women of color and classical pragmatist conceptions of\ncommunity, writing that “each discourse speaks to gaps in the other”\n(2012, 444). Collins specifically argues that pragmatism offers\nintersectionality a means of forming a robust conceptualization of the\nrelation between individuals and broader social structures, as well as\na potential site of political action, whereas intersectionality offers\npragmatists a framework for conceptualizing actually existing power\nrelations, an explicit analytic of which pragmatism has historically\nlacked. The insights that emerge from this dialogue are of crucial\nsignificance to the anti-oppressive project: “to grow,\nintersectionality must become an intellectual leader. It is compelled\nto build something anew, drawing from knowledge projects such as Black\nfeminist thought and American pragmatism without defining itself in\nopposition to them…commit[ting] to an open-ended process of creative\nsocial action, incorporating the ideas and actions of these and other\nknowledge projects into its own praxis” (2019, 188).  \nWillett continues to intersect continental, pragmatist, and feminist\nwork in Irony in the Age of Empire: Comic Perspectives on\nDemocracy and Freedom (2008). Willett’s ongoing interest in\nquestions of freedom lead her to examine how it can be supported and\nencouraged by comedy, including social ridicule, satire, and\ncarnivalesque laughter. As Willett ranges widely from philosophy to\nfilm and television to political tragedies, she draws on the\ntragicomic philosophy of Cornel West to develop an “augmented\npragmatism, inflected fully by the comic spirit,” in order to\n“provid[e] the philosophical basis for reconceptualizing\nfreedom” (2008, 16). Willett also puts Jean-Paul Sartre and\nHenri Bergson in conversation with Ralph Ellison and filmmaker Spike\nLee to explore how satire can help nurture an emancipatory political\nethics.  The result is a feminist-infused account of democracy and\nfreedom that appreciates the politically transformative possibilities\nof comedy. \nIn “How is This Paper Philosophy?” Kristie Dotson (2012) takes this\nexpansion further. Dotson considers professional philosophy and its\npersistent failure to recruit women of color and other “diverse\npractitioners” (5), arguing that this failure is symptomatic of a\n“culture of justification” (6) in the discipline, which\nemphasizes legitimation and presumes the norms of that legitimation\nare univocal amongst all subjects. Dotson considers the testimony of\nblack feminists and phenomenologists, including Donna-Dale Marcano\n(2010) and Gayle Salamon (2009) to highlight the feelings of\n“incongruence” (Dotson 2012, 13) that many diverse practitioners\nexperience when confronted with these supposedly univocal norms, which\noften conflict with their lived experiences. In response, Dotson\nargues for the cultivation of “a culture of praxis,” in the discipline\nof philosophy, in which we value investigation of “issues and\ncircumstances pertinent to our living,” recognizing that this will\nvary considerably depending on populations, as well as “recognition\nand encouragement of multiple canons and multiple ways of\nunderstanding disciplinary validation” (17). In so doing, Dotson\nargues, philosophy would thereby admit a diversity of concerns,\nmethods, and canons, not for the sake of rendering all contributions\nequal, but for the sake of investigating which contributions might be\n“useful for some projects and irrelevant for others.” The upshot of\nsuch a cultivation would not only be to allow philosophy as a\ndiscipline to benefit from the ideas of diverse practitioners, but to\nmake philosophy itself better able to present “livable options” (26)\nto those practitioners, and to black women in particular.  \nOne of the effects of Nancy Fraser’s work in social and political\nphilosophy and critical theory has been to raise questions about the\nbenefit to feminists of drawing upon certain strands of continental\nphilosophy. For example, Fraser finds value in the theories of\nthinkers such as Foucault, Bourdieu, and Habermas (among others)\nbecause their notions of discourse include a rich array of\nhistorically embedded social practices (1997, 151–152). By\ncontrast, Fraser claims that “feminists should have no truck\nwith the versions of discourse theory that they attribute to [Jacques]\nLacan [and] only the most minimal truck with related theories\nattributed to Julia Kristeva” (1997, 151). This is because\nFraser views Lacan and Kristeva as reducing the variety of forms of\nhuman communication to language narrowly understood as a symbolic\nsystem. Given the variety of continental theories that feminists might\nengage, Fraser argues that what is needed is a “pragmatics\nmodel” (1997, 155). Also called “neo-pragmatism” by\nFraser (in Benhabib, et al. 1995, 167), such a model would allow\nfeminists to separate the wheat from the chaff in continental\nphilosophy and incorporate the best it has to offer into feminist\ntheory (1997, 208). Fraser thus uses pragmatism as a method by which\nto discriminate between different continental theories, and in so\ndoing, raises the broader question of the relative advantages and\ndisadvantages for feminism of intersecting pragmatist and continental\nphilosophy. \nSimilarly, Erin C. Tarver has argued that pragmatists should be wary\nof importing James’s views wholesale, and on the contrary, that\nelements of James’s philosophy that presuppose a masculine subject or\na too-robust vision of individual autonomy must be “recognized and\nrejected” (2015, 99). The reason for this is that such presuppositions\nare often not merely sexist, but have profound ontological and ethical\nimplications that would further entrench anti-feminist social\nhierarchies. Yet, Tarver frames this willingness to revise or\nselectively draw from certain elements of James’s thought as\nconsistent with pragmatic fallibilism. She writes, “We must be willing\nto take James’s fallibilism and deference to new evidence seriously\nenough to apply it to his own works” (100) rather than dismissing\nmasculine language and assumptions as regrettable instances of sexism\nthat can be overlooked as the product of another time. Thus, according\nto Tarver, feminist philosophical engagement with pragmatism must be\nwilling to critique and reject, even when engaging with thinkers whose\nideas can be useful for feminist aims.  \nThis list of possible topics in the area of feminist intersections of\npragmatist and continental philosophy certainly is not comprehensive,\nnor are the possibilities contained within it fully fleshed out. That\nwork awaits others interested in this new field. The forms that it\nwill take remain to be seen and are eagerly awaited.","contact.mail":"ssullivan@uncc.edu","contact.domain":"uncc.edu"},{"date.published":"2002-12-06","date.changed":"2019-09-18","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/femapproach-prag-cont/","author1":"Shannon Sullivan","author2":"Erin Tarver","author1.info":"https://clas-pages.uncc.edu/shannon-sullivan/","entry":"femapproach-prag-cont","body.text":"\n\n\nFeminist philosophy is a large and growing subfield of the discipline.\nFeminist philosophers vary in their methodologies and philosophical\naims, and are often grouped by their approaches to philosophy, or by\nthe philosophical traditions that have influenced them (for example,\nas analytic, continental, or pragmatist feminists). This entry\nprovides an overview of the group of feminist thinkers whose work\nincorporates elements of both continental and pragmatist\nphilosophies.\n\n\nGiven the occasional confusion of the colloquial and the philosophical\nsenses of the term “pragmatism” and the slipperiness of\nthe term “continental” (or “postmodern”)\nphilosophy, a word about the two fields is in order before turning to\nfeminist approaches to their intersections. The so-called classical\nperiod of American philosophy, best known for its creation of American\npragmatism, was developed in the United States from the late\nnineteenth to the middle of the twentieth century by figures such as\nJane Addams, W.E.B. Du Bois, John Dewey, William James, Alain Locke,\nGeorge Herbert Mead, Charles Sanders Peirce, Josiah Royce, and Alfred\nNorth\n Whitehead.[1]\n Waning in popularity after the Second World War, American pragmatist\nphilosophy experienced a revival in the 1970s, often credited to the\n“neo-pragmatist” work of Richard Rorty (see especially\nRorty 1979), that continues today. Far from being an anti-theoretical\nposition that champions level-headed practicality as is sometimes\nthought, pragmatist philosophy stresses the dynamic relationship\nbetween theory and practice and especially the value of each for\ntransforming the other. It seeks to undermine other sharp dichotomies\nas well, including those between body and mind, subject and object,\nends and means, and nature and culture. Viewing knowledge as a tool\nfor enriching experience, pragmatism tends to be pluralistic,\nexperimental, fallibilist, and naturalistic. Rejecting the quest for\nabsolute certainty, it takes a meliorist attitude that human action\nsometimes can improve the world.\n\n\nPragmatism’s emphasis on experience, developed in the wake of Darwin’s\nevolutionary theory, perhaps best distinguishes it from other\nphilosophical fields. Pragmatism demands that philosophy grow out of\nand test its merits in the “soil” of lived experience.\nThis is not to abjure abstraction, but rather to insist that\nphilosophy deal with the genuine problems of living organisms, not the\nartificial problems of an academic discipline. It is important to\nrealize, however, that pragmatists understand the concept of\nexperience as “double-barrelled,” in James’s words (James\nquoted in Dewey 2000, 463). Experience refers not only to the\nso-called “subjective” experience of a living being, but\nalso to the “objective” world that is experienced by it.\nBiology and evolutionary theory teach that plants and non-human\nanimals cannot live apart from the environments that feed and sustain\nthem. Pragmatist philosophy incorporates this lesson by insisting that\nall of experience, including human experience, needs to be understood\nas an interaction between organism and environment. Functional\ndistinctions can be made between the two, but for pragmatism, no sharp\ndichotomy between them exists.\n\n\nContinental philosophy is more difficult to define as a class.\nSomewhat ironically, the concept of continental philosophy is a\ncreation of philosophers in the United States who focus on (or who are\ninfluenced by) the work of post-Enlightenment European thinkers,\nespecially those in France and Germany. While the range of European\nfigures studied by continental philosophers is too large and varied to\nlist comprehensively here, one could say that it begins with\nnineteenth century theorists such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,\nSøren Kierkegaard, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Nietzsche;\ncontinues with twentieth century thinkers such as Theodor Adorno,\nLouis Althusser, Walter Benjamin, Simone de Beauvoir, Gilles Deleuze,\nMichel Foucault, Sigmund Freud, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Martin Heidegger,\nEdmund Husserl, Jacques Lacan, Jean-François Lyotard, Herbert\nMarcuse, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jean-Paul Sartre; and extends into\nthe twenty-first century with contemporary writers such as Pierre\nBourdieu, Jacques Derrida, Jürgen Habermas, Julia Kristeva, and\nLuce Irigaray.\n\n\nSince the specific fields represented by these theorists range from\ngenealogical philosophy, phenomenology, existentialism, and critical\ntheory to deconstruction, hermeneutics, post-structuralism, and\npsychoanalytic philosophy, the label “continental” must be\nunderstood more as an umbrella concept than a precise term.\nNevertheless, contemporary continental philosophies can be seen as\nsharing a suspicion of what Lyotard (1984) has called “grand\nnarratives,” which are accounts of the world and human existence\nthat (attempt to) legitimate and provide them with meaning from a\nposition external to them. Some examples of grand narratives under\nattack by continental philosophers include the idea that facts and\nvalues are sharply opposed to one another, the assumption that the\nself is essentially unified, and the belief that the pursuit of\nknowledge is for its own sake rather than driven by particular human\ninterests. A rejection of grand narratives does not entail the\ninability to make distinctions, such as those between fact and value,\nknowledge and politics, inside and outside, and thing and process. It\ninstead means understanding those distinctions as made from a\nparticular perspective and within a particular context, and remaining\nopen to the criticism and possible rejection of them if they fail to\nserve the purposes for which they were selected. The outlook of\ncontinental philosophy thus tends to be historical and perspectival,\nemphasizing the co-constitutive relationship of subject and object,\npower and social-political location, and knowledge and truth.\n\n\nIn its perspectival, historical, and contextual approaches to\nphilosophy, continental theory finds significant points of contact not\nonly with American pragmatism, but also with much of contemporary\nfeminist philosophy. In general and especially when influenced by\ncontinental and pragmatist philosophy, feminist philosophy can be seen\nas targeting the grand narratives of patriarchy and male privilege,\narguing that many of the so-called objective and universal truths of\nphilosophy are instead pronouncements made from a\nparticular—that is, male-biased—point of view. Above all,\nas this essay will reveal, the dual impact of continental and\npragmatist philosophy contributes to a feminism that challenges the\nphilosophical construction of sharp dichotomies and opposed binaries.\nSuch a challenge is feminist because even when dualisms do not\nexplicitly refer to women, gender, or sexuality, they tend to be\nimplicated in and to produce masculine (and particularly white\nmasculine) privilege.\n\n\nIn spite of many affinities between pragmatist, continental, and\nfeminist philosophies, there have historically been few feminists\nwhose work is recognized as explicitly incorporating both of the other\ntraditions. Instead, there have been a handful of feminists well known\nfor working out of a continental tradition who also, in a less\nrecognized fashion, have drawn from pragmatist themes and figures. In\nwhat follows, we discuss five themes that emerge in the work of\nfeminists customarily associated with continental philosophy to\nilluminate the particular way that each combines pragmatist and\ncontinental thought. In the final section, we consider more recent\nwork by feminists pioneering new uses of the intersection of\ncontinental and pragmatist feminism, and suggest possible future\ndirections that the young field might take.\n\nOne of philosophy’s responses to the presence of flux and change in\nthe world has been to seek stability in the fixed and unchanging.\nAnother has been to try to rigidly order and compartmentalize that\nwhich is ambiguous or indeterminate. These quests for certainty and\npurity have been the concern of pragmatist and continental feminists\nbecause of their endorsement of traits seen as masculine and their\ncorresponding rejection of those viewed as feminine. Given western\nculture’s association of women with the impure, ambiguous, and\ndisorderly, the quest to free philosophy from those characteristics\nhas been a simultaneous attempt to flee from everything associated\nwith the feminine. \nIn The Flight to Objectivity: Essays on Cartesianism and\nCulture, Susan Bordo criticizes the “‘flight from the\nfeminine’” that has resulted from philosophy’s quests for\ncertainty and purity (1987, 118). She argues that in the wake of work\nby Richard Rorty, Michel Foucault, and feminist historians and\nphilosophers of science such as Evelyn Fox Keller and Sandra Harding,\nphilosophy cannot easily sustain its anti-cultural and non-historical\naccounts of the world. Adopting Rorty’s metaphor of “the mirror\nof nature” (1979) to criticize philosophy’s self-conception as a\nneutral reflection of what is given in the\n world,[2]\n Bordo provides a psychocultural analysis of the development of that\nmirror in the work of René Descartes. Rorty’s Nietzschean and\nDeweyan approach to philosophy understands it as a form of cultural\ntherapy, that is, as a way to improve or “cure” the\n“illnesses” of contemporary society. Similarly, The\nFlight to Objectivity brings together feminist concerns and\npsychoanalytic tools to identify western culture’s Cartesian\n“disease.” Bordo’s diagnosis is that Cartesian anxiety in\nthe face of epistemological doubt is in fact an anxiety due to\nseparation from an organic universe conceived of as female. \nTaking seriously the experiential bases of Descartes’s skepticism,\nBordo identifies the epistemological problem over which Descartes\nobsessed to be that of psychological corruption, which threatens to\nmake it impossible to know how and when to trust one’s felt sense of\nconviction when one believes something to be true. Drawing on Dewey’s\nanalysis in The Quest for Certainty (1988) and the\nanthropological work of Mary Douglas, Bordo argues that an absolutist\nquest for purity is a common response to anxiety over the messiness\nand ambiguity of the world. Moreover, she explains that the quest for\npurity during times of high cultural anxiety is correlated with an\nincrease in male social domination. As anthropologist Peggy Reeves\nSanday’s cross-cultural findings demonstrate, male domination within a\nculture tends to be at its most extreme when that culture experiences\nitself as being in too much flux (Bordo 1987, 111). For Bordo,\nDescartes’s response to historical changes such as the cultural and\nscientific revolutions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\nsuch as Martin Luther’s reformation movement and Copernicus’s\nheliocentricism, was to attempt to establish a firm division between\nconfusion and order, the impure and the pure, the ambiguous and the\ncertain, the body and the mind, and the “dirty” from the\n“clean.” Descartes thus can be thought of as the\nquintessential “dirt-rejecter” of Western philosophy\n(1987, 82). As Bordo argues, the mark of Cartesianism is not so much\nits claims to neutral objectivity as it is its “passion for\nintellectual separation, demarcation, and order” (1987,\n77). Given western culture’s long-standing\nassociation between reason, the orderly mind, and masculinity, on the\none hand, and emotions, the messy body, and femininity, on the other,\nDescartes’ rejection of flux for order was at the same time a\nprivileging of the (culturally constituted) masculine over the\n(culturally constituted) feminine. \nDewey once claimed that a felt sense of “insecurity generates\nthe quest for certainty” (Dewey 1988, 203). Following up on that\nclaim, Bordo argues that the problematic genius of Descartes was to\nfind a way to convert his anxiety in the face of the impure and\nambiguous into the confidence and certitude of objectivity. As Bordo\nexplains, “Where there is anxiety, there will almost certainly\nbe found a mechanism against that anxiety” (Bordo 1987, 75).\nDescartes took that which produced dread—the perceived\nbarrenness of a mechanistic world—and turned it into an\nadvantage, into that which makes objectivity, and thus also certainty,\npossible. In defense against the painful anxiety he felt about the\nprocess of separating from the organic whole of the universe,\nDescartes effectively declared that he willed and welcomed such a\nseparation. His defense, in other words, can be seen as a\nreaction-formation to a painful loss. Tracing the historical and\ncultural masculinization of thought and the corresponding reconception\nof nature as dead and mechanical rather than organic and alive, Bordo\ndemonstrates how what was lost was the previous cultural conception of\na “female cosmos and ‘feminine’ orientation towards\nthe world” (1987, 100). Descartes’s method of achieving absolute\ncertainty thus is as much a “flight from the feminine”\nhistorically and culturally associated with the organic and fluid, as\nit is the creation of a new epistemological criterion of and method\nfor objectivity. \nSpace is often thought of as relatively static in comparison with the\ndynamism of time. Time moves forward, we often say, while space is\ncommonly conceived as merely an empty gap that passively rests\nbetween, for example, the walls of a house or the beams of a bridge.\nWhat would it mean, however, to question this dualistic opposition of\nspace and time? What if space were also thought of as dynamic and\nmoving? And what impact would this revised conception of space have on\nphilosophical ideas about the bodies that inhabit space? As some\nfeminists have argued, rethinking spatiality as becoming, rather than\nas static being, can help philosophy rethink bodily life and\nmateriality in dynamic ways as well. Given the long-association of\nwomen with bodies and materiality, moreover, the reconceptualization\nof the latter has important implications for women and feminism. \nIn Architecture from the Outside: Essays on Virtual and Real\nSpace (2001), Elizabeth Grosz explores these conceptual questions\nabout space, time, and materiality by working in the intersections of\narchitecture and philosophy. Engaging in “conceptual or\nphilosophical [rather than concretely architectural]\nexperiments,” she forces architecture to examine the importance\nof temporality and sexuality for practices of building and making and\nattempts to render both architecture’s and philosophy’s concepts of\nspace more dynamic and fluid (2001, xviii). Grosz argues that\narchitecture is problematic from a feminist perspective because it\nlargely has ignored questions of sexual and racial differences. Not\nputting enough women’s bathrooms, relative to men’s, in concert halls,\nauditoriums, and other public buildings that draw large numbers of\npeople is one simple example of this neglect. Yet it also can be seen\nin the more complex ways that spaces are gendered and raced. How, for\nexample, does architecture contribute to raced and racist urban spaces\nby aiding the gentrified rebuilding of inner cities, a process that\ntends to displace poor, non-white populations for the benefit of\nmiddle class white people? Architecture’s neglect of questions such as\nthese is a serious matter for Grosz. Nonetheless, she argues that as a\nkind of liminal point between culture and nature, the field of\narchitecture also presents an ideal opportunity for feminists to\ntrouble many of the absolutized binary categories that often plague\nphilosophy: inside and outside, self and other, and subject and\nobject, to name just a few. It might also help philosophy “think\nof itself more humbly as a mode of producing rather than as a mode of\nknowing or intellectually grasping or mastering concepts, moving\n[philosophy] closer to everyday life and its concerns, which would be\ngood for [it]” (2001, 6). As a self-proclaimed\n“outsider” to architecture—a term used playfully\ngiven that she will smudge the lines between inside and\noutside—Grosz thus traverses the boundaries between architecture\nand philosophy to address questions of materiality and becoming that\nmight produce changes in the lived experience of spatiality. \nGrosz is interested in a philosophy that would integrate dynamic and\nproductive notions of change and time into that of space. On her view,\nsuch integration would help both architects and philosophers think of\nspace in dynamic and creative, rather than static and worn-out ways.\nAccording to Grosz, such a philosophy requires above all\n“pragmatic models” (2001, 120). With the term\n“pragmatic,” Grosz includes thinkers in both the\ntraditions of American and continental philosophy who operate with a\n“self-consciously evolutionary orientation” (2001, 169).\nThis “philosophical pragmatism meanders from Darwin, through\nNietzsche, to the work of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, Henri\nBergson, and eventually through various lines of descent, into the\ndiverging positions of Richard Rorty, on the one hand, and Gilles\nDeleuze on the other” (2001, 169). Positioning herself within\nthis lineage, Grosz affirms “pragmatist philosophers who put the\nquestions of action, practice, and movement at the center of\nontology” (2001, 169). Doing so allows them, for example, to\n“understand[d] the [inorganic] thing as question, as\nprovocation” for organic life (2001, 169).\nThis would be to take becoming and an evolutionary openness to the\nfuture various seriously for it would dare to think of the so-called\ninanimate, static thing as continuous with animate, dynamic,\norganic—including human—life. Doing so would operate with\nthe distinction between animate and inanimate in order to show their\ninteractions. It would acknowledge that the animate and the inanimate\nexist as poles on a continuum, where differences shade into one\nanother rather than stand starkly apart. \nIn questioning conventional boundaries between thing and non-thing,\nGrosz’s goal is not to completely collapse all distinctions between\nbinary categories, but rather to complicate their relationships so\nthat new possibilities might open up. Likewise, the purpose of her\nwork is not to urge the attempt to live in a world of total\nflux—as if such a thing were possible. Following James, Grosz\ninstead insists that the “teeming flux of the real” must\nbe rendered into discrete objects and that human beings are not able\nto choose not to do so (2001, 179). What she adds, however, is that\nphilosophy and architecture need to recognize that categories for\nobjectifying the world do not fully capture it in all its complex\nmultiplicity and that there is a residue that remains. This residual\nexcess is not in rigid opposition to objects and categories; rather it\nand the world of flux are continuous with the world of discrete\nobjects, in dialogue and movement with them. To think the relationship\nbetween flux and object as Grosz would have philosophers do is to\nthink the thing as she has described it: as a fluid “point of\ncrossing” rather than as a static fixity (2001, 171). \nGrosz does not often provide explicit details about how such a\n“philosophical pragmatism” might benefit feminism. Indeed,\nas she says of herself in an interview that composes chapter one of\nthe book, “I feel sure that in order to keep my feminist work\nalive I have to keep it at bay, at a bit of a distance” (2001,\n26). In the context of the entire book, however, one can understand\nher distanced feminism as another functional “outsider” to\nboth philosophy and architecture that, like all outsides, forces those\npositioned within the inside to really “think”\n(2001, 64). In the example of her own work,\nGrosz claims that she had to move away from her earlier work on the\nbody (Grosz 1994) because she had “worked to death” the\ntopic. Moving to the field of architecture has allowed her to approach\nthe question of materiality in a fresh way (2001, 26). Making that\nmove, Grosz offers feminists an example of how to get some distance\nfrom and thus gain a new perspective on familiar feminist concepts so\nthat fresh insight into them is possible. Grosz thus provisionally\npreserves the distinctions between continental and pragmatist\nphilosophy, architecture, and feminism in order to enable the\n“infection by one side of the border of the other [and] a\nbecoming otherwise of each of the terms thus bounded” (2001,\n65). \nTechnology and science have had and continue to have an enormous\nimpact on the contemporary world. The weapons, medicines, automobiles,\nelectronics, and other goods they produce have been both beneficial to\nand problematic for human and non-human animal life. Important to\nunderstanding the particular impact of technology and science is to\nfocus not just on their products, however, but also on the processes\nby which those products come into existence—and, moreover, not\nonly the mechanical, but also the social processes as well. The\nproducts of contemporary technoscience are hybrid compilations of\nmaterial goods, human labor, and social relations that often are\noppressive. As such, they cannot be understood if they are conceived\nof as mere things, abstracted away from their social contexts. Doing\nso interferes with the ability to ask questions about whom\ntechnoscience benefits and whom it exploits or otherwise harms. \nMuch of Donna Haraway’s work stresses the importance of asking these\nquestions. In Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of\nNature (1991), Donna Haraway introduces the figure of the cyborg,\nan “impure” creature who scrambles orderly divisions\nbetween the natural and artificial/technical, and the human and the\nnon-human/animal. Continuing her exploration of “ontological\nconfusing bodies” in\nModest_Witness@Second_Millennium.FemaleMan©_Meets_\n\nOncoMouse™: Feminism and\nTechnoscience (1997, 186), Haraway speaks as a cyborgian\n“modest witness” to contemporary technoscience, at once\nboth implicated in and suspicious of its processes and products.\nExtending her earlier insights into how humans “polish an animal\nmirror to look for ourselves” (1991, 22), Haraway criticizes the\nway that science takes nature as a static given, congealing and\nobscuring social relations such that they can be taken as\ndecontextualized things-in-themselves. (It should be noted, however,\nthat other feminists have taken issue with Haraway’s characterization\nof science. Mary Magada-Ward (2014) in particular has argued from a\npragmatic feminist perspective that Haraway’s willingness to criticize\nscience as one narrative among others is irresponsible, and endangers\nthe very liberatory projects with which feminists are aligned.)  \nFor Haraway, Western culture is extremely fetishistic, mistaking\n“a fixed thing for the doings of power-differentiated lively\nbeings” (1997, 135). To analyze the web of economic,\npsychological, and philosophical threads that compose this fetishism,\nHaraway appeals to the work of Marx, Freud, and Whitehead.\nEconomically, socio-technological relations often are taken to be\ncommodities whose value is intrinsic rather than the product of the\nlabor and practices of organic life. Hand-in-hand with this\npolitico-economic fetishism goes a psychological denial of this\nsubstitution that makes the “mistake” of taking things for\nprocesses very difficult to recognize. Finally, wound up with these\ntwo strands is the philosophical error that misunderstands concrete,\nrelational processes as fixed, simple abstractions (1997, 147). All\nthree threads of this fetishism are bound up in, for example, the\ncomputer chip, which is incredibly valuable and necessary to late\ncapitalist, technological society. Locating its value in pieces of\nmetal and plastic and electronic codes, however, we lose sight of the\nhistorical and labor processes that produce and sustain the computer’s\nexistence. A product of World War II, the computer was developed to\nhelp calculate artillery trajectories so that bombs would be more\neffective (read: destroy more property and kill more people). Today,\ncomputer chips and mother boards often are produced by Asian women in\nthe U.S. and various third-world countries, who are seen as especially\nappropriate for such jobs because of their “Oriental”\nnimble finger work and attentiveness to small details (1991, 154,\n177). When we fetishize the chip, we are incapable of seeing this\n“final appropriation of women’s bodies in a masculinist orgy of\nwar” (1991, 154). That is to say, we render ourselves incapable\nof understanding how the materials, processes, and concerns of a\nhighly militarized, technoscientific culture shape the world and our\nvery selves. \nThe process philosophy of Whitehead subtly provides crucial support\nfor Haraway’s analysis of fetishism and, indeed, much of her critique\nof technoscience. As Haraway explains in a footnote to\nModest_Witness (1997, 297n21), Whitehead has been important\nto her work since at least her days as a graduate student, and she\nbelieves that the general thrust of his ideas can be discerned in a\ngreat deal of feminist science studies and philosophy of science. For\nWhitehead, everything in the world is a “concrescence of\nprehensions,” prehensions being the grasping or feeling of one\nthing by another in their on-going relations of becoming (1997, 47). A\nconcrescence of prehensions, then, is a growing together of processes\nof becoming that allows some relations to function as a unified,\ndistinct thing, or “actual entity.” What Whitehead calls\nthe fallacy of misplaced concreteness occurs when abstract logical\nconstructions—such as the notion of a thing’s primary qualities\nor of its simple location in space-time—are (mis)taken for the\nconcreteness of processual, actual entities. The effect of this\nmistake, in Haraway’s terms, is the fetishization of things. Allying\nherself with Whitehead, Haraway emphasizes the prehensional\n“reachings into each other in the tissues of the world”\n(1997, 147)—for example, genes, computer chips, fetuses,\nOncoMouse™—that are the concrete, actual materials of\nWestern technoscience. \nAlthough she argues against fetishism, it would be misleading to\nconclude that Haraway is thus also arguing “for” the\nontologically messy hybridity that results when one gives fetishism\nup. Neither, however, is Haraway “against” hybridity. Both\nof these positions are too categorical for the issue at hand. In\nHaraway’s view, hybridity presents possible dangers and potential\nbenefits alike and thus must be examined in its various\nparticularities. Haraway’s task, thus, is to pragmatically ask,\n“for whom and how [do] these hybrids work?” (1997, 280 n1)\nWho benefits, for example, from OncoMouse™, the mouse with human\ngenes for developing breast cancer that has been developed and\ntrademarked by DuPont? This question not only points to the issue of\nhuman beings’ taking “noninnocent responsibility” for the\nuse of non-human animals as research tools (1997, 82). It also points\nto questions about environmental toxins, environmental racism, and the\navailability and affordability of health care for African American\nwomen in light of their increasing death rates from cancer while those\nof white women remain the same (1997, 113). Asking questions such as\nthese would help enable contemporary technoscience to engage in\npractices of “witnessing,” that is to “stan[d]\npublically accountable for, and psychically vulnerable to [its]\nvisions and representations” (1997, 267). For Haraway, such\naccountability would open up the possibility that technosciences\n“knowledge products” might at the same time be\n“freedom projects” as well (1997, 269). \nIn 1949, Simone de Beauvoir famously claimed that “[o]ne is not\nborn, but rather becomes, a woman” (Beauvoir 1989, 267).\nContemporary pragmatist feminist and continental feminist philosophers\ngenerally agree with this claim, rejecting the notion that the\ncategory of woman (and man) and the conception of femininity (and\nmasculinity) are simply given in nature. As a result, some have\nexplored the role of social institutions—such as the media, the\nwork place, and education—in creating the particular type of\ngendered, sexual subject called “woman.” Others have\nfocused on the inner mechanisms of this process, so to speak, asking\nhow the unconscious desires of women are constituted such that their\npsychical lives contribute to their gender and sexuality. These two\napproaches need not be seen as antithetical, however. An understanding\nof how women are constituted as sexual subjects is perhaps best\nachieved by exploring the intersection of the social\n“outside” and the psychical “inside” in the\nformation of subjectivity. \nTeresa De Lauretis’s work takes this intersectional approach, allying\nfeminism, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and film criticism to explore the\nformation of women’s subjectivity and desire in relation to social and\nmaterial reality. In Alice Doesn’t: Feminism, Semiotics,\nCinema (1984), de Lauretis develops the concept of experience as\na process by which the subject is semiotically and historically\nconstructed, arguing that one becomes a woman in and through the\npractice of signs in which women live. In The Practice of Love:\nLesbian Sexuality and Perverse Desire (1994), she continues her\nexploration of these issues by focusing specifically on\n“perverse” formations of sexuality, by which she means\nforms of sexuality that challenge normative heterosexuality and\nespecially lesbian sexuality. In each of these books, de Lauretis\ndraws on the pragmatist semiosis of Peirce to explore the dynamic\njuncture between “inner” and “outer” worlds,\nprivate and public fantasies, and individual experience and social\nmeaning, especially as they construct sexual subjects. \nSemiotics is a term created by Peirce to “designate[s] the\nprocess by which a culture produces signs and/or attributes meanings\nof signs” (de Lauretis 1984, 167). Semiotics thus is a theory of\nhow meaning is created through processes of interpretation. These\nprocesses are so important to Peirce that he goes so far as to claim,\n“my language is the sum total of myself; for the man [sic] is\nthe thought” (Peirce 2000a, 67). This is not a reduction of the\nhuman to a narrowly construed language, however. Rather, the claim is\nthat to understand who or what a person is, one must understand the\nprocesses of interpretation in which she and her various communities\nare engaged. This last point helps brings out the particularly\npragmatist aspect of Peirce’s semiotics. For Peirce, the semiotic\nprocesses that constitute the individual are always grounded in\ncommunity, history, and materiality. To understand the interpretative\nconstitution of the self, one must understand the various\n“external” environments that contribute to it. \nAccording to de Lauretis, an important reason to turn to Peirce is\nprecisely that his theory returns body and history to the subject of\n semiosis.[3]\n For Peirce, semiosis is an unlimited process, but that does not mean\nthat it is an infinite regression of signs merely circulating back on\nthemselves. Rather, as de Lauretis explains, in their address to\nsomeone—and for Peirce, because they are inherently communal,\nsigns always address someone—signs create other signs that are\nthe “significate effects” of the first signs. Peirce calls\nthese sign-effects “interpretants,” and the particular\ntype of interpretant that interests de Lauretis is the one that Peirce\ncalls “logical” because it takes up or makes sense of the\nemotion and energy of the other type of interpretants. The logical\ninterpretant is a modification of a person’s habits,\n“habit” used pragmatically by Peirce to mean a tendency or\ndisposition to a certain manner or style of acting. Thus for Peirce,\nalthough unlimited, semiosis nevertheless always results in the\ntemporary “resting places” of one’s habits of acting and\nthinking—“temporary” because a person’s modified\nhabits will contribute to the production of new signs, which will then\nfeed into the on-going process of meaning-creation that will yet again\nmodify subjects by producing additional habit changes. Thus on\nPeirce’s account—and this is of utmost importance to de\nLauretis—signs have their effect in historical, bodily matter\nand are not narrowly linguistic. \nDe Lauretis faults Julia Kristeva for operating with just such a\nnarrow (mis)understanding of the semiotic subject (1984,\n 171).[4]\n Representing one trend of poststructuralist semiotic theory for de\nLauretis, Kristeva’s approach is at once valuable because of its\npsychoanalytic appreciation of the body and the unconscious, and\nproblematic because of its narrow understanding of linguistics and\nthus its neglect of the social aspects of meaning-creation. The other\ntrend of postructuralist semiotic theory, represented by Umberto Eco,\nappreciates the social side of semiosis but omits exactly what\npsychoanalysis includes: the non-conscious elements of human\nexistence. A similar division, and thus a similar set of problems, can\nbe found between the work of Freud and Foucault, according to de\nLauretis. In his focus on sexuality, Freud offers a “privatized\nview of the internal world of the psyche” while Foucault’s\naccount of sexuality is “eminently social” (1994,\nxix–xx). Thus, for de Lauretis, feminists who seek to understand\nthe semiotic creation of sexual subjects are presented with a\nproblematic choice built on an exclusive binary: either the sexual\nsubject is socially constituted but lacks a psychic interior (Eco and\nFoucault) or the sexual subject has psychic depth but lacks rich\nconnections with the world external to it (Kristeva and Freud). \nPeirce’s advantage is that he attends to both sides of the\ninternal-external divide, furnishing “the link between semiosis\nand reality, between signification and concrete action” (1984,\n175). And yet, for de Lauretis, Peirce’s work is not sufficient by\nitself because it lacks a well-developed notion of the unconscious.\nThus de Lauretis’s self-appointed task is to negotiate the problems\nand promises of all these approaches by means of a pragmatist\nsemiotics, creating a “theoretical overlap” (1984, 168)\nbetween Kristeva’s internalist and Eco’s externalist semiotics, as\nwell as between Freud’s privatized and Foucault’s social sexual\nsubject. Put another way, de Lauretis joins Freud with\nPeirce—admittedly “even stranger bedfellows than Marx and\nFreud” (1984, 215 n31)—to explore how the semiotic\njunction between psychic interior and social exterior produces the\nunconscious habits that create sexual subjects. \nIn some of her most recent work (2000), de Lauretis makes clear that\nalthough semiosis is ongoing and although the habits it produces are\nalways open to future changes, habit-change is not necessarily or\nalways for the better nor can it easily (if at all) be controlled. In\ndialogue with Vincent Colapietro (2000) on how to understand Peirce’s\nlogical interpretant, de Lauretis argues that it is very difficult, if\nnot impossible, to deliberately direct the significate effects of\nsemiosis. In her view here—which appears to diverge somewhat\nfrom her earlier emphasis on Foucault’s concepts of self-analysis and\nself-exercise as Peircean “‘deliberately formed,\nself-analyzing habit[s]’” (Peirce quoted in de Lauretis\n1994, 312)—the juncture of psyche and social that takes root in\nunconscious habits is not amenable to conscious efforts to transform\nit. Rather than being deliberate and reflective, changes to habit tend\nto be random (at least from the point of rational consciousness) and\nare relentlessly subject to all sorts of deformations, compulsions,\nand other neurotic symptoms (2000, 172–73). The semiotic\nconstruction of sexual subjects thus can be seen as perverse not only\nin that it can defy heterosexual conventions but also in that it\nresists the efforts of self-knowledge and self-directed\ntransformation. \nLike gender and sexuality, race is a social-material category that is\nnot simply given in nature. Scholars continue to debate precisely when\nmodern notions of race were created, but since at least the late\neighteenth century, general patterns of white privilege and supremacy\nand the domination of non-white people have existed. Given the\noppressive origins of the concept of race and of whiteness in\nparticular, it might seem that racial identity should be eliminated in\nthe name of eliminating racism. And given that no definitive\nbiological or genetic basis for dividing the human population into\ndiscreet racial groups exists, it might seem easy to eliminate racial\nidentity since it is not real in the ways that it popularly is thought\nto be. But racial identities have a lived reality to them that is not\ndependent on scientific categorizations. Their lived reality not only\nmakes it difficult to eliminate racial identities; it also makes it\nproblematic to unequivocally call for their abolition since their\nelimination could mean the loss of an important source of meaning in\none’s life. \nLinda Martín Alcoff warns feminists and others of this\npotential loss, arguing that the reasons for eliminating class and\nstatus differences do not necessarily apply to racial and other social\nidentities. In Visible Identities: Race, Gender, and the Self\n(2006), she examines race and gender as historical-material formations\nthat are fundamental, rather than peripheral to the self. Analyzing\nphilosophical and political critiques of identity politics, Alcoff\nexplains how identity claims have become suspect because they are seen\nas necessarily divisive, exclusionary, and alienating. Appeals to\nracial and/or gender identities by Latinas, for example, allegedly are\npolitically problematic because they intensify conflict between groups\nand thus are destructive to larger communities or nations (2006, 36).\nAnd they allegedly are philosophically problematic because they\nalienate a person from herself by means of an oppressive and\nartificially imposed category or set of categories (2006, 80). Genuine\nfreedom and authenticity thus would seem to require the abandonment of\nsocial identities. \nAccording to Alcoff, however, hidden behind these attacks on identity\nis a closet individualism that mistrusts any form of sociality or\ncommunity and fears any influence of the Other on the self. “Why\nassume that if I am culturally, ethnically, sexually identifiable that\nthis is a process akin to Kafka’s nightmarish torture machines in the\npenal colony?” asks Alcoff (2006, 81). The answer is that\n“identity in any form [is seen by its critics as] foisted on the\nself from the outside by the Other” (2006, 81). For the\nindividual who insists on his or her absolute independence, social\nidentities represent a loss of control and power through ontological\ndependency upon someone other than oneself. This loss of power is to\nbe feared, and so too then are racial and other social identities to\nbe resisted. \nAlcoff’s responds to this fear by situating it as a very particular,\nrather than universal need to deflect the Other, one felt by\ncolonizers and other dominant groups who do not want to see themselves\nreflected in their victims’ eyes (2006, 81). Antagonism and resistance\nare not the only forms that relationships between self and other can\ntake. The interdependency of self and other can be recognized in such\na way that “the Other’s view of me—that is, my identity in\nthe Other’s presence—is internalized and thus is constitutive of\nmy self” (2006, 82). Drawing on the hermeneutics of Hans-Georg\nGadamer and the pragmatism of George Herbert Mead, Alcoff develops a\nconcept of social identity that constitutively situates the individual\nin a communal world. Social identities are not forced onto atomistic\nindividuals who then necessarily become alien to themselves. Racial\nand other identities are, borrowing from Gadamer, “hermeneutic\nhorizons comprised of experiences, basic beliefs, and communal values,\nall of which influence our orientation toward and responses to future\nexperiences” (2006, 287). Or in Mead’s terms, the self is formed\nin and through the context of the “generalized other,”\nwhich is a communal perspective by and through which an individual\ndevelops self-consciousness and thereby learns to perceive both\nherself and others (2006, 117). The hermeneutic notion of horizon\nallows feminists and others to appreciate how race and gender are real\nin that they are lived positions in which individual meaning is\ncreated in relationship to history and experience. An individual\nalways operates within specific horizons, but because horizons open\nout to indeterminacy, a range of interpretative meaning is available\nfrom within those horizons (2006, 43). And Mead’s account of the\nsocial self enhances the notion of horizon by emphasizing its social\ndimensions (2006, 121). The horizon in and through which individual\nmeaning is created is always a world of shared meaning that helps\nconstitute an individual’s self-consciousness and experience. \nFor Alcoff, raced, gendered, and other social identities can be\noppressive, but they are not inherently or necessarily so. The\nultimate question, in her view, “is not how to overcome\nidentity, but how to transform our current interpretations and\nunderstandings of [it]” (Alcoff 2006, 287). Shannon Sullivan\nasks a similar question about whiteness in Revealing Whiteness:\nThe Unconscious Habits of Racial Privilege (2006). According to\nSullivan, white privilege increasingly operates in the form of\nunconscious habit, able to thrive in a world that generally frowns on\novert racism because that racism seems non-existent. With pragmatists\nW.E.B. Du Bois and John Dewey, Sullivan develops an account of\nwhiteness as a raced and racist habit that is constitutive of the self\nand formed through transaction with a raced and racist world. Habit as\nsuch is not a problem to be solved although some habits, such as white\nprivilege and domination, can be very harmful. For Sullivan, as a\nstyle or predisposition for engaging with/in the world, habit is\nsimultaneously malleable and durable, which means that habits can be\ntransformed but that such transformation tends to take a long\ntime. \nThis especially true in the case of habits of white privilege, given\ntheir increasingly unconscious operations. Developing a pragmatized\nnotion of the unconscious—one that is sympathetic to de\nLauretis’s work on Peirce and Freud—Sullivan explains the\nunconscious as formed through transaction with its various social,\npolitical, material and other environments (2006, 47). Drawing on the\npsychoanalytic theory of Jean Laplanche, Sullivan also modifies the\npragmatist concept of habit to account for the ways that habits of\nwhiteness “often are deviously obstructionist, actively blocking\nthe self’s attempts to transform itself for the better” (2006,\n44). Racist habits of whiteness can be changed, but only indirectly,\nthrough changes to the environments that help constitute those habits.\nAs Sullivan (2006, 10) argues, “relocating out of geographical,\nliterary, political, and other environments that encourage the white\nsolipsism of living as if only white people existed or mattered can be\na powerful way of disrupting and transforming unconscious habits of\nwhite privilege.” And yet even here a word of warning is in\norder, according to Sullivan. Habits of white privilege can and often\ncontinue to operate in the midst of the best intentions to undermine\nthem through control of one’s environments. Since habits of white\nprivilege tend to be characterized by “ontological\nexpansiveness,” in which white people treat all spaces as\nrightfully inhabited by them, attempts to master one’s environment in\nthe name of anti-racist struggle simultaneously can be a reinforcement\nof that privilege (2006, 144). Sullivan thus cautions that although\nstruggles to eliminate white privilege must continue, habits of racial\nprivilege will not quickly or easily be eliminated. \nCompared to continental feminism, pragmatist feminism is a small\n field.[5]\n It is growing, however, and as it does so, the chances that more work\non the intersections of feminism, pragmatism, and continental\nphilosophy will be produced also increase. To date, one common thread\nthat loosely unites feminist cross-fertilizations of continental and\npragmatist philosophy is its criticism of oppositional, exclusionary\nbinaries; another is a commitment to philosophical work that engages\nwith lived experience and everyday life. In this closing section, we\noutline possible avenues for future work in pragmatist and continental\nfeminism, and highlight recent developments in the field. \nFor over two decades, understanding the relationship between\nembodiment and gender, race, and sexuality has been an important topic\nfor continental feminists, especially Susan Bordo (1993), Judith\nButler (1990 and 1994), Elizabeth Grosz (1994), and Gail Weiss (1999).\nIn Living Across and Through Skins: Transactional Bodies,\nPragmatism and Feminism (2001), Shannon Sullivan engages Butler’s\nand (to a lesser degree) Bordo’s work, along with that of\nMerleau-Ponty, Nietzsche, and Dewey, to argue for a feminist\nconception of bodily life as transactional. Sullivan presents bodies\nas dynamically constituted in and through relationships with their\npolitical, social, material, and other environments, and she does so\nfor the purpose of exploring which bodies transactional processes\nbenefit and harm and thus whether those processes should be embraced\nor transformed by feminists and others. \nLadelle McWhorter’s Bodies and Pleasures: Foucault and the\nPolitics of Sexual Normalization (1999) does not explicitly\nappeal to pragmatist philosophy, but its affinities with pragmatist\nmethods and concerns can be drawn out. McWhorter argues that the value\nof Foucault’s philosophy should not be judged by the truth (or\nfalsity) of what it says, a method of evaluation that relies upon what\nRorty (1979) calls “the mirror of nature.” In its place,\nMcWhorter asks feminist and other readers of Foucault to pragmatically\njudge his work on what it does, that is, on the transformative impact\nthat it has on their lives. Using her own life as a text, McWhorter\n“takes an experience of reading Foucault’s works as [her] point\nof analysis” (1999, xix) and demonstrates the feminist-friendly\neffects of Foucault’s particular account of bodies, pleasures, and the\nformation of sexual subjects. \nFoucault also is the focal point of Cressida J. Heyes’s\nSelf-Transformations: Foucault, Ethics, and Normalized Bodies\n(2007). As Heyes asks with Foucault how growth in a\nperson’s capacities can be separated from increased docility\nwithin power relations, she draws on Richard Shusterman’s\npragmatist somaesthetics. A bodily discipline that both critically\nstudies and uses sensory-aesthetic appreciation to improve lived\nexperience, somaesthetics can be a point of\n“counterattack” (2007, 123) that helps a person care for\nher embodied self in ways that increase her freedom. It does this by\nteaching non-normative ways of experiencing and evaluating one’s\nbodily experiences, increasing the capacity of what one can think and\ndo. Through her concrete examples of yoga and other bodily practices,\nHeyes draws on continental and pragmatist philosophy to take “a\nfirst step toward creating grander feminist projects from existing\nsomaesthetic practices” (2007, 136). \nMarjorie Jolles, in contrast, doubts that Shusterman’s\npragmatism can provide the critical counterpoint to bodily\nnormalization that both Foucault and feminist philosophy need. This is\nbecause bodily experience is shaped by the very normalizing forces\nthat it is supposed to challenge. Responding to Heyes in “Between\nEmbodied Subjects and Objects: Narrative Somaesthetics” (2012), Jolles\nargues that “Shusterman does not go far enough in establishing\nsomaesthetics’ suitability of Foucauldian feminist efforts to\nshape one’s life” in anti- and non-normative ways (2012,\n307). Proposing an alternative to Shusterman’s somaesthetics,\nJolles develops what she calls narrative somaesthetics. Modeled on\nfeminist consciousness-raising, narrative somaesthetics incorporates\ninto somatic practices narrative work that helps disrupt\nnormalization. On Jolles’s view, by combining discursive and bodily\npractices, feminist philosophy will have a better shot at countering\nthe harmful somatic effects of sexist oppression. \nPragmatist resources for thinking about embodiment also is the subject\nof Maurice Hamington’s (2004) Embodied Care: Jane Addams, Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty, and Feminist Ethics. In that book, Hamington\nargues that human bodies are built for care and that care can only be\nunderstood properly in conjunction with its embodied dimensions.\nDistinguishing care—a contextual, corporeal, interdependent way\nof being in the world—from the theory of care ethics, Hamington\nintersects Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of bodily habits with\nAmerican pragmatist Jane Addams’ embodied practices of democracy and\ncitizenship to demonstrate the body’s centrality to feminist ethics.\nDeveloping the concepts of caring habits, caring knowledge, and caring\nimagination, Hamington affirms Jane Addams’ “simple yet powerful\nmandate that we boldly experience one another” through our\nembodied practices of care (2004, 145). \nFinally, some feminists emphasize the practical value of\nphenomenological and pragmatic accounts of embodiment and the self for\nsolving specific problems in the real world. Jennifer Hansen, for\nexample, in her contributions to the philosophy of psychiatry, has\nemphasized the therapeutic value of a conception of the habitual body\nand the narrative self for the treatment of individuals with bipolar\ndisorder. Though such individuals may experience self-distrust as a\nresult of difficulty with seeing themselves “as consistent\nagents” (2013, 69) brought on by challenges with identifying with\ntheir past actions in either manic or depressive states, Hansen argues\nthat clinicians can assist patients build a coherent sense of self by\nincorporating insights about habitual embodiment. Drawing on Grosz and\nIris M. Young’s (2005) feminist phenomenology, as well as James’s\naccount of habit as central to embodied selfhood, Hansen suggests that\nthe habitual body’s capacity to engage with the world in consistent,\ngoal-directed ways, despite doing so unconsciously, provides an\ninroad to a self-concept that is coherent. Although such habitual\nmoments (of, for example, opening familiar doors or performing special\nlearned skills like CPR) are often performed unconsciously, we can\nbegin to notice and appreciate them “if others, such as a clinician,\npoints them out to us” (2013, 72.) Although such recognition may seem\na small step, they could be useful as patients begin to cultivate\nself-trust. Clinicians, moreover, may assist patients in recognizing\nthat even seemingly rudimentary habits have significance in creating a\nsense of self: “Although the habitual body of a bipolar patient may\nnot have a habitual moral character, she may, for example, have a\nhabit of recycling” (72). The recognition of such habits could be\nbeneficial in beginning to build self-trust. Traditional views of\npsychiatry may view individuals with bipolar disorder as incapable of\n“coherent” selfhood in the ordinary sense of the word, but Hansen\nshows that feminist phenomenological and pragmatic “accounts of\nembodiment show another way in which bipolar selves can be coherent:\nthey cohere in habitual bodies” (73). \nThe concept of the Other offers a potential site for productive\ndiscussion and disagreement between feminist, pragmatist, and\ncontinental philosophers. As Charlene Haddock Seigfried notes,\n“[p]ragmatists tend to celebrate otherness by seeking out and\nwelcoming difference as an expression of creative subjectivity”\n(1996, 267). The optimistic tone that pragmatism often takes toward\nalterity is markedly different from that of Julia Kristeva’s claim\nthat one is always other to oneself: “Foreigner: a choked up\nrage deep down in my throat. By recognizing him within ourselves, we\nare spared detesting him in himself” (1991, 1). Contemporary\npragmatist feminists have tended to be more skeptical than most\ncanonical pragmatists of the category of the Other because they\nrecognize it as a means of domination. Yet, influenced by pragmatism,\nthose feminists tend not to construe the Other in as alienating and\nforeboding way as Kristeva does. Pragmatist and continental philosophy\nthus presents feminists with a variety of resources for thinking\nthrough the benefits and dangers of different conceptions of the\nOther, including the role of the Other in the constitution of both\nself and community. \nCynthia Gayman (2011) and Erin C. Tarver (2013), for example, have\nargued that women’s constitution as subjects in a social milieu of\noppressive gender relations ironically opens the possibility for\nchange and subversion. Tarver’s argument proceeds by bringing a\nDeweyan account of habit to bear on Judith Butler’s theory of gender\nas performative, whereas Gayman puts Dewey in dialog with Foucault.\nSpecifically, Gayman combines a Foucaultian account of the gendered\nsubject with a Deweyan insistence that critical investigation happens\n“by recognition of a problem, which in turn provokes the kind of\nreflexive activity leading to recognition that what is, does not have\nto be” (2011, 67). Because the individual is constituted through her\ninteractions and transactions with others in the world, the\nrecognition of problems necessarily occurs through everyday\nexperiences and interactions. It is not that others are themselves\nproblems; rather, the encounters in our world that cause us to stumble\nprovoke us to ask questions about how to proceed. They, as Gayman puts\nit following Foucault and Colin Koopman (2011), provoke a\n“problematization” (67). Thus, for Gayman, although patterns of gender\nsubordination that women encounter as they become subjects in and\nthrough interaction with others in the social world must be resisted,\n“to be resisted they must be seen, that is, recognized in the first\nplace, which means they must be  experienced , as well as \nproblematized” (75). Encounter with the other, which happens\nnecessarily through experience, is therefore necessary for the\ndevelopment of feminist consciousness.  \nIn psychoanalytic terms, the imaginary is the collection of (largely)\nunconscious fantasies and images that shapes both individual subjects\nand their worlds. In different ways, the work of both Donna Haraway\nand Luce Irigaray seeks to reveal the male privilege and domination\ncontained within the current imaginary so that a space for a different\nsort of imaginary might be opened for the future. Although Irigaray is\nthe better known for it, both she and Haraway appropriate the image of\nthe speculum in this process, appealing to the gynecological mirror as\nan “instrument for rendering a part accessible to\nobservation” (Haraway 1997, 197) and revealing how the feminine\ninstrument is not itself reflected in its work of mirroring others\n(Irigaray 1985). While Haraway “excavate[s] something like a\ntechnoscientific unconscious” (1997, 151), Irigaray investigates\nthe psychoanalytic “science that still cannot make up its\nmind” about “woman, science’s unknown” (1985, 15,\n13). Their work thus offers interesting resources for uncovering a\npatriarchal culture’s blind spots and transforming its unconscious\nimaginary, as well as raises important questions about the role that\nscience can or should play in feminist theorizing of the\n future.[6] \nNoëlle McAfee also draws on psychoanalytic theory to analyze the\nunconscious operations of democratic societies. In Democracy and\nthe Political Unconscious (2008), McAfee blends poststructural\npsychoanalysis, feminist philosophy, and semiotics with Deweyan,\nRawlsian, and Habermasian democratic theories. The result is a\nsophisticated argument that when some members of a society are denied\nthe ability to participate in the public sphere, that society will\ntend to develop a political unconscious. As McAfee explains, the\npolitical unconscious is not a thing or a place, but rather “an\neffect of processes: failures to sublimate well, desires\nunarticulated, voices kept silent, repressions reenacted without\nacknowledgement of their origins” (2008, 12). Understanding with Dewey that the public is called into\nbeing by particular problems and that it can have difficulty finding\nitself when those problems are immense, McAfee develops democratic\nstrategies for public processes of mourning so that age-old traumas of\nrepression and exclusion no longer are compulsively repeated. \nLike McAfee, José Medina draws on several thinkers in both the\ncontinental and pragmatist traditions to argue for a feminist response\nto oppressive socio-political conditions. Unlike McAfee, however,\nMedina conceives the project of resistance to oppression as\nfundamentally epistemological in nature. The reason for this is that,\nas he argues in The Epistemology of Resistance (2013), while\ndemocratic practice requires collective engagement, “in contexts of\nsexual and racial oppression there are cognitive-affective deficits\nthat amount to specific forms of epistemic insensitivity: the\ninability to listen to and learn from others, the inability to call\ninto question one’s perspective and to process epistemic friction\nexerted from significantly different perspectives” (2013, 17–18). Such\ndeficits undermine the possibility of genuine democratic engagement\nand prevent the privileged in particular of recognizing the\nsocio-political injustices in which they are complicit. However,\nMedina’s epistemological project is both critical and constructive.\nDrawing especially on the work of Foucault and James, he articulates a\nvision of the epistemological practices we must take up in order to\nresist oppression, for “epistemic and sociopolitical melioration\ngo hand in hand” (301).  \nMedina argues that knowers have a “shared responsibility with respect\nto epistemic justice for the correction of blind spots and social\ninsensitivities associated with racism and (hetero)sexism” (2013, 25),\nsuggesting that those subjects whose privilege prevents them from\ndeveloping knowledge of or sensitivity to experiences beyond their own\nhave an obligation to unsettle their epistemic ease by seeking out\n“epistemic friction” and “cultivat[ing] a resistant imagination” (26) that\nwould sensitize them to the experiences of marginalized and\nstigmatized subjects. The prescription that Medina offers for\naccomplishing such cultivation, which he terms “guerilla pluralism”\n(284), is inspired by a combination of insights from Foucault and\nJames. Both Foucault and James conceive truth and knowledge as plural\nand as the product of particular interests and purposes. One of the\nkey ways in which they differ, however, is in the implications of this\nview of knowledge that they emphasize: whereas James offers a\n“melioristic pluralism,” in which epistemic contestations and\nnegotiations are directed toward improving the objectivity of the\ndifferent standpoints available, toward correcting their biases and\nmistakes, and toward “maintain[ing] their truth alive” (283),\nFoucault’s genealogical approach offers a less rosy view of the\npossibilities of epistemic melioration, and aims less at learning than\nunlearning received ways of viewing the world. Foucault, then, would\nhave us “resurrect counter-memories, not just for the sake of joint\ncooperation, but for the sake of reactivating struggles and energizing\nforms of resistance” (284). Drawing from Foucault the importance of\nspecific mechanisms to break down settled regimes of power/knowledge\nand from James the imperative to find a way to move forward in\nimproving the social conditions in which we live, Medina advocates the\nformation of a resistant social imagination through genealogical\ninvestigations: “genealogical investigations constitute critical\ninterventions in the social imagination that can help us make our\nsense of a shared past more pluralistic and open to diversity” (292).\nThis is not to say, however, that the end point of such investigations\nwill be the total overcoming of oppression or even of culpable shared\nignorance. Rather, in a pragmatic vein, Medina emphasizes a\nfallibilist approach to investigation that remains open to correction\nand critique through “radical solidarity: the cultivation of an\never-expanding accountability and responsiveness to indefinitely many\nothers, which is required by a resistant epistemic agency” (302). Such\nfallibilism, unlike radical relativism in which “any way of framing\nand interpreting is as good as any other,” is committed to producing a\nresistant imagination characterized by its exertion of “beneficial\nepistemic friction” (303) that is aimed at continual self-correction\nand resistance to oppression and the ignorance that necessarily\naccompanies it. \nCelia T. Bardwell-Jones (2018) makes use of Medina’s epistemology of\nresistance to theorize the conflict between hospital administrators\nand Native Hawaiian mothers in policies regarding the treatment of the\nplacenta after hospital births in Hawai’i. Before 2006, as\nBardwell-Jones explains, hospitals regarded the placenta as hazardous\nhuman waste, which needed to be disposed of as a threat to public\nhealth. This put hospital policy in direct conflict with Native\nHawaiian practice, which required burying the placenta in a ceremony\nafter birth, as a means of affirming the connection of the infant with\nthe environment and community from which they came. Because of the\nlasting legacy of colonialism in Hawai’i, this conflict was\nunhelpfully framed as a conflict between “modern” and\n“traditional” views of health (which, as Bardwell points\nout, ignores the fact that many Native Hawaiian mothers do in fact\nvalue modern hospitals and choose to give birth in them). The dominant\nbiomedical view that barred taking home the placenta, moreover, relied\n“on an assumption of epistemological superiority”\n(106). Following Medina, Bardwell-Jones argues that this biomedical\napproach’s privileged position left it epistemically insensitive to\nNative Hawaiian knowledges about the moral value of a sense of place\nand community. To overcome such insensitivities, she suggests,\nhospital administrators should do as Medina says and aim to cultivate\nepistemic friction—or, as she puts its, “perplexity”\n(107)—by seeking out genuine engagement with differentially\nsituated others. Doing so is useful not only for the purpose of\nadequately serving the community in which the hospital is located, but\nalso for beginning to recognize when existing health care policy is in\nfact “informed by a state of moral panic” (110) that can\nsurround public health discussions, but of which the medical\nestablishment may very well be unaware. \nThe expansion of the canon of “classical” American\nphilosophy to include more than white men opens up new possibilities\nfor feminist intersections of continental and pragmatist philosophy.\nCynthia Willett’s The Soul of Justice: Social Bonds and Racial\nHubris (2001) is a good example of one such possibility. In this\nbook, Willett critically intersects G.W.F. Hegel and Luce Irigaray\n(among others) with the “visionary pragmatism” (2001, 175)\nof African-American thinkers such as Toni Morrison and Patricia Hill\nCollins to present an account of freedom based in social bonds.\nRejecting modernity’s and psychoanalysis’s account of separation as\ncrucial to the formation of subjectivity, Willet draws on accounts of\nslavery to show how the destruction of erotic connections through the\nviolence of separation results in social death. With this account,\nWillett suggests how an expanded understanding of American pragmatism\nthat includes black women can combine with continental philosophy to\nproduce a feminist and anti-racist liberatory theory that appreciates\nthe constitutive role that desire plays in social relationships. In\nrecent years, additionally, Collins (2012; 2019) herself has written\non the value of an explicit dialogue between intersectionality theory\nfounded by women of color and classical pragmatist conceptions of\ncommunity, writing that “each discourse speaks to gaps in the other”\n(2012, 444). Collins specifically argues that pragmatism offers\nintersectionality a means of forming a robust conceptualization of the\nrelation between individuals and broader social structures, as well as\na potential site of political action, whereas intersectionality offers\npragmatists a framework for conceptualizing actually existing power\nrelations, an explicit analytic of which pragmatism has historically\nlacked. The insights that emerge from this dialogue are of crucial\nsignificance to the anti-oppressive project: “to grow,\nintersectionality must become an intellectual leader. It is compelled\nto build something anew, drawing from knowledge projects such as Black\nfeminist thought and American pragmatism without defining itself in\nopposition to them…commit[ting] to an open-ended process of creative\nsocial action, incorporating the ideas and actions of these and other\nknowledge projects into its own praxis” (2019, 188).  \nWillett continues to intersect continental, pragmatist, and feminist\nwork in Irony in the Age of Empire: Comic Perspectives on\nDemocracy and Freedom (2008). Willett’s ongoing interest in\nquestions of freedom lead her to examine how it can be supported and\nencouraged by comedy, including social ridicule, satire, and\ncarnivalesque laughter. As Willett ranges widely from philosophy to\nfilm and television to political tragedies, she draws on the\ntragicomic philosophy of Cornel West to develop an “augmented\npragmatism, inflected fully by the comic spirit,” in order to\n“provid[e] the philosophical basis for reconceptualizing\nfreedom” (2008, 16). Willett also puts Jean-Paul Sartre and\nHenri Bergson in conversation with Ralph Ellison and filmmaker Spike\nLee to explore how satire can help nurture an emancipatory political\nethics.  The result is a feminist-infused account of democracy and\nfreedom that appreciates the politically transformative possibilities\nof comedy. \nIn “How is This Paper Philosophy?” Kristie Dotson (2012) takes this\nexpansion further. Dotson considers professional philosophy and its\npersistent failure to recruit women of color and other “diverse\npractitioners” (5), arguing that this failure is symptomatic of a\n“culture of justification” (6) in the discipline, which\nemphasizes legitimation and presumes the norms of that legitimation\nare univocal amongst all subjects. Dotson considers the testimony of\nblack feminists and phenomenologists, including Donna-Dale Marcano\n(2010) and Gayle Salamon (2009) to highlight the feelings of\n“incongruence” (Dotson 2012, 13) that many diverse practitioners\nexperience when confronted with these supposedly univocal norms, which\noften conflict with their lived experiences. In response, Dotson\nargues for the cultivation of “a culture of praxis,” in the discipline\nof philosophy, in which we value investigation of “issues and\ncircumstances pertinent to our living,” recognizing that this will\nvary considerably depending on populations, as well as “recognition\nand encouragement of multiple canons and multiple ways of\nunderstanding disciplinary validation” (17). In so doing, Dotson\nargues, philosophy would thereby admit a diversity of concerns,\nmethods, and canons, not for the sake of rendering all contributions\nequal, but for the sake of investigating which contributions might be\n“useful for some projects and irrelevant for others.” The upshot of\nsuch a cultivation would not only be to allow philosophy as a\ndiscipline to benefit from the ideas of diverse practitioners, but to\nmake philosophy itself better able to present “livable options” (26)\nto those practitioners, and to black women in particular.  \nOne of the effects of Nancy Fraser’s work in social and political\nphilosophy and critical theory has been to raise questions about the\nbenefit to feminists of drawing upon certain strands of continental\nphilosophy. For example, Fraser finds value in the theories of\nthinkers such as Foucault, Bourdieu, and Habermas (among others)\nbecause their notions of discourse include a rich array of\nhistorically embedded social practices (1997, 151–152). By\ncontrast, Fraser claims that “feminists should have no truck\nwith the versions of discourse theory that they attribute to [Jacques]\nLacan [and] only the most minimal truck with related theories\nattributed to Julia Kristeva” (1997, 151). This is because\nFraser views Lacan and Kristeva as reducing the variety of forms of\nhuman communication to language narrowly understood as a symbolic\nsystem. Given the variety of continental theories that feminists might\nengage, Fraser argues that what is needed is a “pragmatics\nmodel” (1997, 155). Also called “neo-pragmatism” by\nFraser (in Benhabib, et al. 1995, 167), such a model would allow\nfeminists to separate the wheat from the chaff in continental\nphilosophy and incorporate the best it has to offer into feminist\ntheory (1997, 208). Fraser thus uses pragmatism as a method by which\nto discriminate between different continental theories, and in so\ndoing, raises the broader question of the relative advantages and\ndisadvantages for feminism of intersecting pragmatist and continental\nphilosophy. \nSimilarly, Erin C. Tarver has argued that pragmatists should be wary\nof importing James’s views wholesale, and on the contrary, that\nelements of James’s philosophy that presuppose a masculine subject or\na too-robust vision of individual autonomy must be “recognized and\nrejected” (2015, 99). The reason for this is that such presuppositions\nare often not merely sexist, but have profound ontological and ethical\nimplications that would further entrench anti-feminist social\nhierarchies. Yet, Tarver frames this willingness to revise or\nselectively draw from certain elements of James’s thought as\nconsistent with pragmatic fallibilism. She writes, “We must be willing\nto take James’s fallibilism and deference to new evidence seriously\nenough to apply it to his own works” (100) rather than dismissing\nmasculine language and assumptions as regrettable instances of sexism\nthat can be overlooked as the product of another time. Thus, according\nto Tarver, feminist philosophical engagement with pragmatism must be\nwilling to critique and reject, even when engaging with thinkers whose\nideas can be useful for feminist aims.  \nThis list of possible topics in the area of feminist intersections of\npragmatist and continental philosophy certainly is not comprehensive,\nnor are the possibilities contained within it fully fleshed out. That\nwork awaits others interested in this new field. The forms that it\nwill take remain to be seen and are eagerly awaited.","contact.mail":"e.c.tarver@emory.edu","contact.domain":"emory.edu"}]
