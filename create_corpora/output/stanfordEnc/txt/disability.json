And yet philosophical interest in\nthese conditions was piecemeal and occasional until the past hundred\nor so years. Some of these conditions were cited in litanies of life's\nhardships or evils; some were the vehicle for inquiries into the\nrelationship between human faculties and human knowledge [see SEP\nentry on “Molyneux's Problem”]. But the treatment of\ndisability as a subject of philosophical interest is relatively\nnew.\n\n\nThe lack of attention to “disability” or\n“impairment” in general may have a simple explanation:\nthere were no such concepts to attend to until 19th century\nscientific thinking put variations in human function and form into\ncategories of abnormality and deviance. Once such categories were\nestablished, it became possible to talk, and generalize, about\n“the disabled,” and philosophers have done so for various\npurposes (Hacking, 1990; Davis, 2002, Ch. 4)). The resurgent political\nphilosophy of the second half of the last century, preoccupied with\neliminating or reducing unearned disadvantages, tended to treat\ndisability as a primary source of those disadvantages, to be addressed\nwith medical correction or government compensation. Somewhat later,\nsocial philosophers began to see disability as a source both of\ndiscrimination and oppression, and of group identity, akin to race or\nsex in these respects.\n\n\nIn some ways, disability looks much like sex or race as a\nphilosophical topic. It concerns the classification of people on the\nbasis of observed or inferred characteristics. It raises difficult\nthreshold questions about the extent to which the classification is\nbased on biology or is socially constructed. And yet the strong\nphilosophical interest in some of the characteristics on which the\ndisability classification is based appears to accord them a\nsignificance that many would deny to the distinguishing\ncharacteristics of sex or race.\n\n\nConsider, for example, the question of how well-being is affected by\nthe characteristics on which the disability classification is based.\nThere is little interest now in the question of whether, in a world\nwithout discrimination, blacks or women would do better or worse on\nvarious metrics of well-being than whites or men. In contrast, there\nis considerable interest in this question when the subject is people\nwith\n disabilities.[1]\n Some philosophers and disability scholars claim that the answer is no\ndifferent than in the case of race or sex: to the extent that\ndisability reduces well-being, it is because of the stigma and\ndiscrimination it evokes. In contrast, other philosophers claim that\ndisability is fundamentally different from race and gender in that it\nnecessarily reduces well-being: even in a utopian world of\nnon-discrimination, people with blindness, deafness or paraplegia\nwould be worse off than their able-bodied counterparts. This is but\none example of the many ways that disability generates philosophical\ndebate about some of our most familiar ethical, political, and\nepistemological concepts.\n\n\nThis introductory entry will outline the prevailing definitions and\nmodels of disability, and discuss the epistemic and moral authority of\nthe experiences and self-reports of people classified as disabled.\n\n\nThe definition of disability is highly contentious for several\nreasons. First, it is only in the past century that the term\n“disability” has been used to refer to a distinct class of\npeople. Historically, “disability” has been used either as\na synonym for “inability” or as a reference to legally\nimposed limitations on rights and powers. Indeed, as late as 2006, the\nOxford English Dictionary recognized only these two senses of the term\n(Boorse, 2010). As a result, it is hard to settle questions about the\nmeaning of “disability” by appeal to intuitions, since\nintuitions may be confused by the interplay between older,\nordinary-language definitions and newer, specialized ones. \nSecond, many different characteristics are considered disabilities.\nParaplegia, deafness, blindness, diabetes, autism, epilepsy,\ndepression, and HIV have all been classified as\n“disabilities.” The term covers such diverse conditions as\nthe congenital absence or adventitious loss of a limb or a sensory\nfunction; progressive neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis;\nchronic diseases like arteriosclerosis; the inability or limited\nability to perform such cognitive functions as remembering faces or\ncalculating sums; and psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and\nbipolar disorder. There seems to be little about the functional or\nexperiential states of people with these various conditions to justify\na common concept; indeed, there is at least as much variation among\n“disabled” people with respect to their experiences and\nbodily states as there is among people who lack disabilities. Indeed,\nsome have questioned, in part because of this variation, whether the\nconcept of disability can do much philosophical work (Beaudry,\n2016). \nAt the same time, defining “disability” solely in terms of\nsocial responses like stigmatization and exclusion does not\ndistinguish disability from race or sex (Bickenbach, 1993)—a\nresult that some disability scholars might welcome, but that begs, or\nobscures, an important question. The challenge of distinguishing\n“disability” from other concepts, without taking a\nsimplistic or reductive view of it, has been taken up by various\nspecialized definitions. \nTwo common features stand out in most official definitions of\ndisability, such as those in the World Health Organization (2001;\n1980), the U.N. Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities\nfor People with Disabilities, the Disability Discrimination Act\n(U.K.), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (U.S.) : (i) a\nphysical or mental characteristic labeled or perceived as an\nimpairment or dysfunction (in the remainder of this entry, we will\nrefer to such characteristics as “impairments,” without\nassuming the objectivity or validity of that label) and (ii) some\npersonal or social limitation associated with that impairment. The\nclassification of a physical or mental variation as an impairment may\nbe statistical, based on the average in some reference groups;\nbiological, based on a theory of human functioning; or normative,\nbased on a view of human flourishing. However classified, impairments\nare generally seen as traits of the individual that he or she\ncannot readily alter. Just what makes a condition a trait or attribute\nof an individual is obscure and debatable, but there seems to be\nagreement on clear cases (Kahane and Savulescu, 2009). Thus, poverty\nis not seen as an impairment, however disabling it may be, nor is\ntasteless clothing, even if it is a manifestation of impaired\nfashion-sense rather than scarce income. On the other hand, diseases\nare generally classified as impairments, even though they are rarely\npermanent or static conditions. Diseases that are not long-lasting,\nhowever, such as the flu and the measles, do not count as\nimpairments. \nThe notion of a limitation is broad and elastic, encompassing\nrestrictions on such “basic” actions as lifting one's arm\n(Nordenfelt, 1997; compare Amundson, 1992: actions “at the level\nof the person”); on more complex physical activities such as\ndressing and toileting; and on social activities like working,\nlearning or voting (see Wasserman, 2001). \nThe characterization of both features is disputed. Several scholars\nhave challenged the prevailing view of impairment as objective and\nbiologically grounded (Shakespeare, 2006; Davis, 2002; Tremain, 2001;\nAmundson 2000). There is also disagreement about the conceptual and\npractical need for two categories of limitations, one involving\npersonal activity, the other social or political\nparticipation—“disability” and\n“handicap,” respectively (Wright, 1983; Edwards, 1997;\nNordenfelt, 1997; Altman, 2001). But the most controversial issue in\ndefining disability is the relationship between the two. At one\nextreme are definitions that imply, or are read to imply, that\nbiological impairments are the sole causes of limitation. The\ndefinitions in the World Health Organization's 1980 International\nClassification of Impairment, Disability, and Handicap, and the\nDisability Discrimination Act (UK) have been interpreted this way. At\nthe other extreme are definitions that attribute the limitations faced\nby disabled people solely to “contemporary social\norganization,” such as the definition given by the Union of the\nPhysically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS, 1976). Such\ndefinitions appear to treat impairments merely as\n“evocative” causes—as conditions that are subject to\nexclusion and oppression. They have been criticized for ignoring\ndisadvantages that cannot be attributed to social attitudes and\npractices (Terzi, 2009, 2004; Shakespeare, 2006). But in\ncharacterizing disability in terms of exclusion, these definitions\nneed not deny that impairments have undesirable aspects, such as pain\nor discomfort—merely that those aspects are not within the\nscope, or part of the meaning, of disability. \nIn-between are definitions which assert that individual impairment and\nthe social environment are jointly sufficient causes of\nlimitation. Perhaps the best-known example is the WHO's International\nClassification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF, 2001),\nwhich emphasizes that disability is a “dynamic interaction\nbetween health conditions and environmental and personal\nfactors.” Such interactive definitions predominate in current\nlaw and commentary on disability; even the ICIDH and DDA can be\ninterpreted as compatible with this approach. The ADA is generally\nseen as adopting an interactive approach to disability, although it\ncontains an amalgam of definitional features. \nThese different understandings of the relationship of impairment to\nlimitation inform two contrasting approaches to disability, often\ndescribed as opposing models: the medical and social. The medical\nmodel understands a disability as a physical or mental impairment\nof the individual and its personal and social consequences. It regards\nthe limitations faced by people with disabilities as resulting\nprimarily, or solely, from their impairments. In contrast, the\nsocial model understands disability as a relation between an\nindividual and her social environment: the exclusion of people with\ncertain physical and mental characteristics from major domains of\nsocial life. Their exclusion is manifested not only in deliberate\nsegregation, but in a built environment and organized social activity\nthat preclude or restrict the participation of people seen or labelled\nas having disabilities. \nIn their extreme forms, the medical and social models serve to chart\nthe space of possible relationships between impairment and limitation\nmore than to reflect the actual views of individuals or institutions.\n(A variety of more formal models, described in Altman, 2001,\ngraphically represent the causal complexity of disability.) The\nmedical model is rarely defended but often adopted unreflectively by\nhealth care professionals, bioethicists, and philosophers who ignore\nor underestimate the contribution of social and other environmental\nfactors to the limitations faced by people with disabilities. \nA variety of social models are embraced by disability scholars and\nactivists in and outside of philosophy. The “British social\nmodel” associated with the UPIAS (1976) definition quoted above\nappears to deny any causal role to impairment in disability. As\nsuggested, however, that denial may best be seen as limiting the scope\nof “disability” to the effects of exclusion and\ndiscrimination (Beaudry, 2016), or as rhetorical, countering the\nprevailing emphasis on biological causes of disadvantage. More\nmoderate versions of the social model maintain the emphasis on social\ncauses while insisting on the interactive character of disability\n(e.g., Bickenbach 1993; Altman, 2001). Taking the poor fit between\natypical embodiment and standard environments as their starting point,\nthey treat disability as an interaction between biological and social\ncauses, denying causal priority to either. \nImplicit in the UPIAS definition of disability are two ways that\nsociety imposes limitations on disabled people, corresponding to two\ndistinct strands of the social model. When the UPIAS claims that\nsociety “excludes” people with impairments, this suggests\nthe minority group model, which sees people with impairments\nas a minority subject to stigmatization and exclusion. On this view,\nthe main reason people with disabilities encounter hardship is because\nthey suffer discrimination along the same lines as racial or ethnic\nminorities. Accordingly, civil rights protections and\nanti-discrimination laws are the proper responses to disability (e.g.,\nHahn, 1997 and Oliver, 1990). Perhaps the most familiar expression of\nthe minority-group model is found in the preamble to the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act, which describes people with disabilities as\n“a discrete and insular minority”—an explicit\ninvocation of the legal characterization of racial minorities. \nThe UPIAS also asserts that “contemporary social\norganization” fails to “take into account” people\nwith disabilities. This suggests the human variation model,\naccording to which many of the challenges faced by disabled people do\nnot result from their deliberate exclusion, but from a mismatch\nbetween their characteristics and the physical and social environment.\nOn this view, disability is “an extension of the variability in\nphysical and mental attributes beyond the present—but not the\npotential—ability of social institutions to routinely\nrespond” (Scotch and Schriner, 1997). This view of disabilities\nas human variations is closely related to the view that disability is\na universal human condition (Zola, 1989) or shared human identity\n(Davis, 2002, Ch. 1). The claim that disability is universal can be\ntaken as nothing more than a prediction that we will all acquire\nfamiliar disabilities at some time in our lives. But that claim is\nbetter construed as one about the nature of disability; as maintaining\nthat all human beings have physical or mental variations that can\nbecome a source of vulnerability or disadvantage in some settings. \nThese two versions of the social model are not incompatible, differing\nmainly in emphasis. The discrimination stressed by the minority group\nmodel generally leads to, and is expressed in, the societal failure to\naccommodate people with various differences. In some contexts, it is\nappropriate to analogize people with disabilities to racial\nminorities; in others, it is important to reject a dichotomy between\ndisability and normality and treat impairments as continuous\nvariations. If one goal of social policy is to remove discrimination\nand its enduring disadvantages, another is to encompass the full range\nof human variation in the design of the physical environment and\nsocial practices. \nAlthough the social model, in one version or another, is now the\ndominant legislative, social-science, and humanities paradigm for\nunderstanding disability, stronger versions, particularly the British\nSocial Model, have been subject to extensive criticism. Some argue\nthat an adequate conceptualization of disability requires a\nrecognition of impairments as an objective basis for classification,\nto distinguish disability discrimination from other types of\ndiscrimination (Bickenbach, 1993). Several critics argue that extreme\nversions of the model implausibly deny or understate the role of\nimpairment itself as a source of disadvantage (Anastasiou and\nKauffman, 2013; Terzi, 2009, 2004; Shakespeare, 2006). Others,\nhowever, contend that this criticism is misplaced, because the British\nSocial Model does not deny the importance of impairments but rather\nseeks to restrict the notion of \"disability\" to social exclusion and\noppression (Beaudry, 2016).  \nAnother objection is that the social as well as the medical model both\nrest on a false dichotomy between biological impairments and social\nlimitations. There are two versions of this objection. One maintains\nthat disability is a complex phenomenon, in which biological\nimpairment and social exclusion are deeply interwoven and difficult to\ntease apart (Martiny 2015; Anastasiou and Kauffman, 2013). The other\nversion of this objection rejects the treatment of impairment as a\n(strictly) biological phenomenon. “Impairment,” the\nargument goes, is no less a social construction than the barriers\nfaced by people so classified. Claims that there is a stable\nbiomedical basis for classifying a variation as an impairment are\ncalled into question by shifting classifications; by the\n“medicalization” of some conditions (shyness) and\n“demedicalization” of others (homosexuality). Moreover,\nthe social environment appears to play a significant role in\nidentifying and, arguably, in creating some impairments (dyslexia)\n(Cole, 2007; Shakespeare, 2006; Davis, 2002, Ch 1; Tremain, 2001;\nAmundson, 2000). What counts as an impairment may depend on which\nvariations appear to be disadvantageous in familiar or salient\nenvironments, or on which variations are subject to social prejudice:\nLess-than-average height may be more readily classified as an\nimpairment than greater-than-average height because the former is more\noften disadvantageous in environments designed for people of average\nheight, or because it is generally seen as less desirable. For such\nreasons, it is difficult to establish the objectivity of the\nimpairment classification by appeal to a clear and undisputed\nbiomedical norm. Amundson (2000) goes so far as to deny that there is\nany biological basis for a concept of functional normality—a\nclaim emphatically rejected by Boorse (2010).  \nThe disputed objectivity of the impairment classification is adduced\nby Tremain to argue that impairments “must no longer be\ntheorized as essential biological characteristics (attributes) of a\n‘real’ body on which recognizably disabling conditions are\nimposed” (2001, 632). Rather, she argues that being classified\nas having an impairment is an integral part of the social process of\ndisablement. Such criticism parallels the debate among gender\ntheorists about whether we can distinguish sex from gender on the\nground that gender is socially constructed whereas sex is not. [See\nthe SEP entry on “Feminist Perspectives on Sex and\nGender.”]  \nThus, some critics conclude that it is at best oversimplified and at\nworst futile to distinguish biological impairments from social\nlimitations, or to attempt to separate and compare the biological and\nsocial contributions to the disadvantages of people with disabilities\nBut even those who believe that the impairment classification can be\ndefended in biomedical terms recognize that impairments are not merely\nbiologically-defined atypicalities but also markers for\ndiscrimination—discrimination that may be reinforced by the\nconviction that it is a response to objective biological attributes.\nAnita Silvers (2003) has argued that a it is both possible and\ndesirable to construct a neutral, value-free model of disability,\nusing strictly descriptive criteria to identify atypical forms and\nfunctions, thereby allowing scholars with conflicting views to debate\ntheir normative and policy significance.  \nThe medical and social models suggest (although they do not imply)\ndifferent views about the impact of disability on well-being, and\ndifferent views about how disability is relevant to reproductive\ndecisions, medical interventions, and social policy. Those who accept\na social model of disability regard the association between disability\nand well-being as highly contingent, mediated by a variety of\nenvironmental and social factors. They question conceptions of\nwell-being that give a central role to the possession or exercise of\nthe standard array of physical and mental functions, as those\nconceptions imply, or are often taken to imply, that well-being is\nprecluded or diminished merely by the absence or limitation of those\nfunctions. [see SEP entry (forthcoming) on “Disability: Health,\nWell-Being, and Personal Relationships”] As a result, they\ngenerally see the disadvantages of disability not only as externally\ncaused, but as less formidable than they appear to people who view\ndisability in largely biomedical terms. These differences are\nreflected in the conflicting assessments of life with disabilities\nfound in the bioethics and public policy literature on the one hand,\nand disability scholarship on the other (contrast Brock, 2005 with\nGoering, 2008). \nThe different models of disability also seem to favor different\nresponses to disability. The medical model appears to support the\ncorrection of the biological condition or some form of compensation\nwhen that is impractical; the minority group model appears to favor\nmeasures to eliminate or compensate for exclusionary practices and\nrecognize their injustice; the human variation model appears to favor\nreconstruction of the physical and social environment to take into\naccount a wider range of differences in human structure and function.\nImportantly, such reconstruction may also be supported by the minority\ngroup model as an antidiscrimination measure, since that model views\nexclusionary environments and practices as the characteristic form of\ndiscrimination against people with disabilities. The human variation\nmodel may just make explicit the appropriate social response to\ndisability in a society without exclusion or discrimination. \nBut claims about the causes of disadvantage do not always yield\nstraightforward prescriptions for their remediation (Wasserman, 2001;\nSamaha, 2007). In some cases, medical or surgical\n“correction” may be the most effective way to escape\ndiscrimination; if correction is not appropriate, that is because it\nreinforces discriminatory attitudes and practices. The proper response\nto the disadvantages associated with disability depends not only on\ncausal attributions but also on moral judgments about responsibility,\nrespect, justice. The debates over cleft lip surgery and breast\nreconstruction after mastectomy are not only about the comparative\nimportance of biological and social factors in making the treated\nconditions disadvantageous. They also concern whether those\ninterventions are justifiable uses of scarce medical resources, and\nwhether they are complicit with suspect norms (Little, 1998), as in\nthe case of skin-lighteners for people of color (Asch, 2006). \nAlthough it is subject to dispute and qualification, the distinction\nbetween biological impairment and social limitation is relevant to\nmany normative and policy issues, especially those concerning the\nchoice between measures that modify the disabled individual or alter\nhis environment. In this section, we consider the role of that\ndistinction in addressing the critical question of how the experiences\nof people with disabilities are relevant to those issues. The\ndisability rights movement has long complained that the perspectives\nof people with disabilities are too often ignored or discounted. The\nslogan that served as the title for James Charlton's 1998 book,\nNothing About Us Without Us (Charlton, 1998; Stone, 1997) has\noften been invoked to demand the inclusion of people with disabilities\nin policy making and research concerning disability. The slogan\nsuggests that they have both a unique perspective to bring to those\nactivities and a right to take part in them. But what is the\n“us” to whom the slogan refers? Do persons with different\ndisabling traits have enough in common to claim that there is a\n“disability perspective” to bring to bear on policy and\nresearch? \nSuch questions are best approached in terms of the two aspects of\nimpairments recognized by most disability theorists: as structural or\nfunctional atypicalities, and as markers for discrimination. These two\naspects of impairment roughly correspond with two distinct types of\ndisability experience: \nThere may be more commonalities in one kind of experience than the\nother, and greater relevance to specific research or policy issues.\nFurther, the epistemic and moral authority of statements made by\npeople with disabilities about their experiences may vary with the\nkind of experience they describe. \nThe first type of experience involves the particularities of living\nwith atypical embodiment or functioning. Questions about this kind of\nexperience are often framed as what-is-it like questions: “What\nis it like to” have moderate or profound deafness? use a\nwheelchair to move? be legally or totally blind? be unable to hold or\nmanipulate objects with one's hands? have atypical speech? have a\nlearning disability or a mood disorder? Such questions are sometimes\nrequests for factual information about how one manages tasks with\none's disability—“how do you do x if you are in a\nwheelchair?” In other cases, they are requests for self-reports\nabout the phenomenological experience of being in a particular\nstate—“what does it feel like to get around in a\n wheelchair?”[2] \nPeople accustomed to their impairments may have little to report about\n“what it feels like” to have them, in part because absence\nof a function or a sense may not be something they experience as such,\nand because their atypical ways of functioning or sensing may not, in\nthemselves, be affect-laden—it is what they do\nunself-consciously, until it is called to their attention. The\nexperience of atypical functioning or sensing may be far more salient\nfor someone getting to know a person with a disability than it is to\nthe person herself. It may also be highly salient to a person who is\nrecently impaired, trying to function without limbs or senses that she\nused to have. But the experience of loss and frustration becomes less\nsalient with time, peer and professional support, as she gets more\nimmersed in going about day-to-day\n life.[3] \nEven when people with disabilities do report about what “it is\nlike” to have their impairments, those reports may vary\nconsiderably. The most obvious reason is that there is tremendous\nvariation in the sensory, physical and functional states of which\n“impaired” or “disabled” people are capable. A\nperson who can see but not hear has very different sensory experiences\nfrom a person who can hear but not see, who in turn has very different\nexperiences from a person who can see and hear but cannot move his\nlegs. This point should be obvious, but it is worth stressing, because\nit underscores the fact that the labels “disabled” and\n“impaired” do not track a distinct phenomenological\nexperience. \nMoreover, even two people with the same impairment label might give\ndifferent reports of how they do things or how they feel as they go\nabout life with their impairment This could be due partly to\ndifferences in the character or extent of their impairment—not\nall people labeled “deaf” are deaf to the same extent.\nFurther, their experience of life with an impairment may vary with the\nkinds of activity they engage in, and how they regard their\nimpairments as affecting their opportunities for self-fulfillment.\nOpportunities in turn may be influenced by all the factors, unrelated\nto impairment, that affect everyone: the family and neighborhood in\nwhich one grows up or now lives; one's disposition or personality; the\nfinancial resources at one's disposal; or one's education, religion,\nsex, or race. Moreover, people's experience of living with an atypical\nfunction sometimes may be difficult to distinguish from their\nexperience of stigma and discrimination. \nDespite these differences, the experiences of living with diverse\nimpairments have one thing in common—they are likely to be\nignored, or given insufficient weight, in the design of the physical\nand social environment. Unlike new acquaintances, planners and policy\nmakers may pay little attention to “what it is like” to\nget around with atypical functions. In constructing buildings, transit\nsystems, and work schedules, they often fail to listen carefully to\nwhat people with various impairments say about their experiences of\ndaily living. Those experiences cannot be adequately simulated by\nspending a day in a wheelchair or walking around with a\nblindfold—indeed, the confusion and disorientation that\nnondisabled people experience in simulating impairments is a very\nmisleading guide to the way people with disabilities experience and\nnegotiate the activities of daily living. Moreover, in learning about\nthe experiences of living with atypical functions, planners and policy\nmakers cannot take any single impairment as representative. The\nexperiences of people with different impairments differ as much from\neach other as they do from the experiences of nondisabled people. As\nthe human variation model emphasizes, the very diversity of\nimpairments poses an important challenge for an inclusive society. \nIf “baby boomers” who have not learned electronic\ncommunication become a despised, as opposed to merely statistical,\nminority, and if, as a result, they become cut off from friends and\nacquaintances who rely on email and social media for long-distance\ncommunication, and who dismiss them as luddites and fogeys, they will\nlearn something about the social construction of disability. They will\nlearn even more if they cannot cross the “digital divide”\nor can do so only at considerable economic cost or cognitive strain,\nor if they are still regarded as luddites and fogeys even when they\ndo. They will experience something of the stigma and discrimination\nthat cut across impairments. \nThe second type of disability experience, then, is of attitudinal\nbarriers to ordinary activity that are facts of life for people with\ndisabilities. According to the social model, which highlights these\nbarriers, the “disability experience” that links people\nwith cystic fibrosis to people with epilepsy, learning disabilities,\nor cerebral palsy is one of having to deal daily with the largely\nnegative responses of others. These negative responses involve several\nelements. The most discussed is overt stigmatization and\ndiscrimination: being treated as a social outcast, losing out on jobs,\nfriends, or partners, because other people do not want to interact\nwith a person with a disability, or enduring grossly inadequate\naccommodation because reasonable accommodation is thought too costly\nor troublesome. \nBut there are also less overt ways that society makes living with a\ndisability difficult. Simply being different from the majority of the\npopulation, in a way that the majority makes salient, can make people\nwith disabilities feel isolated or alienated. This experience is\nsimilar to those not only of other stigmatized minorities, such as\nAfrican-Americans or LGBTs, but of people with atypical\ncharacteristics who may not form a distinct political or cultural\nminority but are nonetheless constantly reminded of their difference.\nFor example, people whose spouses have died and older adults who are\nsingle for whatever reason may feel excluded from social events\nintended for couples, or face the presumption that they have a\n(usually opposite-sex) partner (“And what does your husband\ndo?”). \nIt is in the social construction of disability that we move from the\nparticularity of any one disability toward the common social\nexperiences of people with disabilities. Stigma, discrimination, and\nimputations of difference and inferiority are all parts of the social\nexperience of disability. Being greeted at a party or a conference not\nby “hello” but by “do you need any help?” and\nhaving virtually every aspect of one's interests, tastes, and\npersonality attributed to one's disability are also parts of the\ndisability experience. As one writer describes it, if he cooks it is\nbecause he doesn't want to be seen in public; if he eats in\nrestaurants it is because he can't cook (Brickner, 1976). Disability\nbecomes a “master status,” preventing people from playing\nany adult social role and eclipsing sex, race, age, occupation, or\nfamily (Goffman, 1963; Gliedman and Roth, 1980). Many nondisabled\npeople assume that people with disabilities won't make good partners\nand cannot or should not become parents (Safilios-Rothschild, 1970;\nShakespeare, 1996; Asch and Fine, 1988; Wates, 1997). People with\ndisabilities are perceived to be globally helpless based on their need\nfor assistance with some facets of daily life (Wright, 1983), fueling\nthe conviction that they are unable to render the help needed for\nsuccessful partnership or parenting. Most nondisabled people, after\nall, are not told that they are inspirations simply for giving the\ncorrect change at the drugstore. Perhaps there would not even be a\n“disability experience” in a world without the daily\nindignities, barriers, and prejudices that characterize life with\ndisability almost anywhere. \nJust as there is great variation in how members of racial and sexual\nminorities experience stigmatization, however, disabled people's\nexperience also varies. In claiming that the experience of stigma\nunites disabled people, we must be careful to acknowledge those\ndifferences. For example, a major source of variation is whether the\ndisability is visible or invisible (Davis, 2005; Banks and Kaschak,\n2003). Whereas visibly disabled people must deal with being instantly\nclassified as “different” and inferior, people with\ninvisible disabilities are often placed in the stressful and\nexhausting position of having to convince others that they are\n“really” disabled and not asking for special treatment.\nThe alternative is to keep quiet and forgo needed assistance, which\ncarries other costs, such as the stress of keeping a secret or trying\nto decide if a particular disclosure is safe (Schneider and Conrad,\n1985; Davis, 2005). \nIn addition, disabled people who are also members of other stigmatized\ngroups may experience a distinct kind of stigmatization that is\n“more than the sum of its parts.” For example, disabled\nwomen are disproportionately affected by society's obsession with body\nimage: they must confront not only sexism and prejudice against\ndisabled people, but a particularly virulent combination of the two\nthat stigmatizes women who do not fulfill a narrow ideal of feminine\nbeauty (Crawford and Ostrove, 2003) or are thought incapable of\nperforming the stereotypically female role of nurturer (Asch and Fine,\n1988). In a similar way, both African-Americans and disabled people\nare frequently stereotyped as dependent or ineffectual. And so\nAfrican-Americans who are also disabled face a particularly high\nburden in overcoming these stereotypes. \nMoreover, some would argue that to the extent that people with\ndisabilities have distinct and common experiences, they are due to\nembodiment as well as stigmatization. A disputed but much-discussed\nstrand of feminist philosophy holds that the experience of being\nfemale differs in important ways from being male, regardless of\ncultural position, discrimination, or political and economic power. On\nthis view, women differ in some important ways from men because of the\nbiology of femaleness and of childbearing, and those differences\nshould be seen as gateways into philosophical and moral understanding\n(Whitbeck, 1972). Discussions of “race” are similarly\ncomplex: is the experience of “race” entirely socially\nconstructed, or is there a biological component after all? (See\ngenerally APA Newsletter on the Black Experience, 2000).\nDebates about the experience of disability can be enriched by\nunderstanding these debates about other minority groups, even if\ndisability differs in significant respects. On the one hand, the\nbiological reality of many significant impairments affects the\nexperience of those with the impairments. On the other hand, different\nimpairments shape experience in very different ways. Clearly,\n“the experience of disability” is complex, and usefully\ncompared to the experience of other stigmatized minorities. \nThe first-hand experience of stigmatization may confer two sorts of\nauthority on people with disabilities. The first is epistemic. There\nshould be “nothing about us without us” because any\ndiscussion of, or research into, disability not informed by that\nexperience would likely be inaccurate and misguided. For example,\ndiscussions of well-being that do not take into account the\nperspective of disabled people may assume that their level of\nhappiness or satisfaction is much lower than it in fact is, or that it\nis lower mainly because of difficulties directly attributable to\nimpairments rather than to attitudes and social barriers. This is but\none application of the more general issue of first-person authority:\nthe extent to which people have special or privileged knowledge of\ntheir own mental states and experiences [see SEP entry on\n“Self-Knowledge”]. Although this is a subject of great\ncontroversy in the philosophy of mind, there is widespread agreement\nthat, at minimum, first-person ascriptions of mental states carry a\ndefeasible presumption of correctness. \nBut there is an additional epistemic reason for according significant\nweight to the first-hand reports of people with disabilities. The\nobservations and judgments of all stigmatized minorities are\nfrequently discounted, but people with disabilities face a distinct\nhandicap. There is a powerful, pervasive tendency among philosophers,\nsocial scientists, and laypeople to dismiss their self-appraisals as\nreflecting ignorance, self-deception, defensive exaggeration, or\ncourageous optimism [see SEP entry on “Feminist Perspectives on\nDisability”, Sec. 3]. Giving those self-appraisals heightened\nattention and deference may be an appropriate and effective way to\ncounteract or correct for that tendency. \nEpistemic authority thus provides a good reason for encouraging\ndisabled people to speak about their experiences and for nondisabled\npeople to listen when they do. But there is another reason as well:\npeople who suffer stigmatization, disrespect, and discrimination have\na moral claim to be heard that is independent of the accuracy of their\ntestimony. Even if someone lacking those experiences could convey them\naccurately and vividly, she would not be an adequate substitute for\nthose who had the experiences. The experience of stigmatization, like\nthe experience of other forms of oppression, calls for recognition,\nand thereby may impose a duty on those fortunate enough to have\navoided such experiences to listen closely to those who have had them.\nTo settle for second-hand accounts of those experiences or to ignore\nthem altogether seems disrespectful to the victims. The conviction\nthat the oppressed have a right to a hearing lies behind the recent\nproliferation of Truth Commissions and tribunals. It also helps\nexplain the frustration of crime and torture victims denied an\nopportunity to tell their stories, even when their oppressors receive\npunishment without their testimony. Though few disability advocates\nwould demand a tribunal for the routine indignities of life with\ndisabilities in developed countries, most demand a far greater voice\nin the media depiction of people with disabilities, in research about\nthem, and in policies concerning or affecting them. \nAt the same time, there are several dangers associated with placing\ntoo much emphasis on the moral privilege of victims of stigmatization.\nFirst, there is the danger of defining people by their oppression. The\nvictims may not want to be spokespeople or witnesses, or not for very\nlong; they may want to move on. It is important to recognize both the\nmoral authority of victims to testify and their prerogative to decline\nthat role. \nSecond, emphasizing the moral privilege of the stigmatized may obscure\ndifferences in the experience of stigmatization, and in the sort of\nauthority it confers. As we have seen, there is tremendous variation\nin the ways that disabled people experience stigma, although certain\nbroad generalizations may hold. \nThird, in conferring privilege on those who experience particular\nforms of oppression, we may obscure or slight the shared vulnerability\nof all human beings. For example, Ruth Anna Putnam champions social\nimprovements for women and other disadvantaged people but is wary of a\nparticularist feminist theory of justice, which may fail to emphasize\ncommonality of human experience and human need (Putnam, 1995). Might a\nsimilar wariness be warranted for disability? If, as Scotch and\nSchriner (1997) point out, we had a philosophy and public policy based\non common human needs, we might be able to get rid of “special\nneeds” and focus on multiple methods of meeting common ones,\nwith no negative shadow cast on any of those varied methods. \nFurther, when only the marginalized are asked to share their\n“experiences,” the experiences of the dominant group are\nleft unarticulated, unexamined, and unexplored. Once we argue that\npeople with disabilities need to be heard in bioethics and policy\ndebates as they describe the values and difficulties in their lives,\nwe should also be arguing for experiential accounts of the dominant\ngroup. When dominants examine their own experiences, they might see\nsimilarities to as well as differences from those who have been\nmarginalized. Both groups might benefit as a result. \nThe final danger in emphasizing the experience of stigmatization is\nthat it will exclude the voices of many people classified as having\ndisabilities but who do not see themselves as disabled or stigmatized.\nPeople with disabilities include millions who do not tend to speak in\nsocial model terms and who may not typically speak to their social, as\nopposed to their medical situation (although they do file\ndiscrimination complaints under the ADA when they think it\nappropriate). People who have back problems, cancer histories,\nParkinson's disease, Type II diabetes, stroke, emphysema, forms of\ndementia, mood disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse, or HIV do not\ntypically count themselves as part of the “disability\ncommunity.” The case for including such people is based in part\non the shared experience of socially-mediated exclusion. For example,\na person who has difficulty breathing because of emphysema and cannot\nvisit friends because she cannot walk to a distant bus stop is\ndisadvantaged by social organization in an analogous way to the person\nwith paraplegia who can't meet friends in inaccessible\nrestaurants. \nSuch inclusiveness, however, requires an acceptance of diverse\nattitudes and opinions. Even if the majority of people we would\nclassify as having disabilities perceived societal mistreatment and\ninstitutional barriers to be more oppressive than their diagnoses, not\nall of them would share that view or agree on the best response.\nAfrican-Americans have different views about affirmative action, and\nmany women do not believe that the option of legal abortion is\nessential for women's full participation in society. Disability\ntheorists can find it frustrating that most nondisabled people in\nbioethics dispute their claims about their experience, but those\ntheorists must respond to whatever challenge to the social model is\nposed by people with disabilities who see their condition, and not\nsociety, as the major impediment to their living rewarding lives. Many\npeople with both congenital and acquired disabilities have said that\nthey don't want cures but do want societal change, but that hardly\nwarrants the charge that Christopher Reeve wasn't speaking from his\nexperience of disability when he argued that what he wanted was\n“cure” and not social change (Johnson, 2003; Shakespeare,\n2006). \nLet us grant that a large number of people with particular impairments\nwill say at least some similar things about life with those\nimpairments, especially concerning stigma and discrimination. We are\nstill left with complex questions about what uses to make of such\nexperience in shaping public policy. \nClearly, one critical role is educational. Forty years ago plenty of\nwell-meaning men wondered why women objected to having doors held for\nthem, or to the exclusive use of male pronouns to refer to humans\ngenerally. Language, social conventions, and many aspects of life have\nchanged because men listened to women's accounts of how seemingly\ninnocuous acts felt, and of why those acts held not-so-innocuous\nimplications for their self-realization and social participation.\n“Why is that person on crutches so offended when I ask him if\nhe's traveling alone?” says the flight attendant who doesn't ask\nthe same question of his nondisabled seatmate. Why doesn't the man who\nis blind let it go when a cab driver won't take his money? A\nnondisabled person may think it would be great not to pay the\noutrageous fare as the meter climbs in New York City traffic. \nThe educational value in explaining the daily experience of stigma\ngoes far beyond “sensitivity training.” In making\nnondisabled people aware of how much of “the burden of\ndisability” arises from routine, seemingly innocuous social\ninteractions, people with disabilities can help to convince them that\nthe direct or internal effects of their various impairments are not\nnearly as bad as imagined. \nTaking the experiences of disabled people seriously may also have\nimportant implications for health policy. As is apparent in many\nbioethical and policy discussions, most nondisabled people, including\nhealth professionals, imagine the experience of disability to be far\nworse than reported by the disabled themselves (Basnett, 2001 and\nGill, 2000). This gap is not explainable solely by the limited contact\nbetween the two groups. In developing a plan for Medicaid rationing in\nOregon in the early 1990s, nondisabled people ranked treatments to\nsustain the lives of people with quadriplegia as of very low priority\nbecause of their presumed low quality of life (Menzel, 1992); people\nwith quadriplegia complained that they had been left out of the\nsurveys and that their appreciation of their lives had not informed\nthe ranking process. Such serious policy errors might\nhave been avoided by a recognition that people with disabilities had\nthe same epistemic authority as nondisabled people to assess the\nquality of their lives. \nThe varied experiences of functioning with an impairment may have a\nmore modest role to play in policy deliberations than the common\nexperiences of stigma and discrimination. But that role is still an\nimportant one. In designing buildings, transit systems, and other\npublic and private facilities, and in establishing norms of conduct in\nschools and workplaces, we need to know a lot about how people with\natypical functions get around and get along. It is not enough to\nensure that the width of a doorway exceeds the width of a standard\nwheelchair; it is also important to find out about the preferences of\nwheelchair mobilizers before and after they enter a building. This\nkind of information is no different from that routinely elicited from\nnondisabled people in designing facilities. But it requires the\nrepresentation of people with a wide array of impairments, and it\nrequires respectful attention to the minutiae of their daily\nlives.","contact.mail":"dtwasserm@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"2011-12-16","date.changed":"2016-05-23","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disability/","author1":"David Wasserman","author2":"Adrienne Asch","author1.info":"https://philosophy.dartmouth.edu/people/daniel-putnam","entry":"disability","body.text":"\n\n\nPhilosophers have always lived among people who could not see, walk,\nor hear; who had limited mobility, comprehension or longevity, or\nchronic illnesses of various sorts. And yet philosophical interest in\nthese conditions was piecemeal and occasional until the past hundred\nor so years. Some of these conditions were cited in litanies of life's\nhardships or evils; some were the vehicle for inquiries into the\nrelationship between human faculties and human knowledge [see SEP\nentry on “Molyneux's Problem”]. But the treatment of\ndisability as a subject of philosophical interest is relatively\nnew.\n\n\nThe lack of attention to “disability” or\n“impairment” in general may have a simple explanation:\nthere were no such concepts to attend to until 19th century\nscientific thinking put variations in human function and form into\ncategories of abnormality and deviance. Once such categories were\nestablished, it became possible to talk, and generalize, about\n“the disabled,” and philosophers have done so for various\npurposes (Hacking, 1990; Davis, 2002, Ch. 4)). The resurgent political\nphilosophy of the second half of the last century, preoccupied with\neliminating or reducing unearned disadvantages, tended to treat\ndisability as a primary source of those disadvantages, to be addressed\nwith medical correction or government compensation. Somewhat later,\nsocial philosophers began to see disability as a source both of\ndiscrimination and oppression, and of group identity, akin to race or\nsex in these respects.\n\n\nIn some ways, disability looks much like sex or race as a\nphilosophical topic. It concerns the classification of people on the\nbasis of observed or inferred characteristics. It raises difficult\nthreshold questions about the extent to which the classification is\nbased on biology or is socially constructed. And yet the strong\nphilosophical interest in some of the characteristics on which the\ndisability classification is based appears to accord them a\nsignificance that many would deny to the distinguishing\ncharacteristics of sex or race.\n\n\nConsider, for example, the question of how well-being is affected by\nthe characteristics on which the disability classification is based.\nThere is little interest now in the question of whether, in a world\nwithout discrimination, blacks or women would do better or worse on\nvarious metrics of well-being than whites or men. In contrast, there\nis considerable interest in this question when the subject is people\nwith\n disabilities.[1]\n Some philosophers and disability scholars claim that the answer is no\ndifferent than in the case of race or sex: to the extent that\ndisability reduces well-being, it is because of the stigma and\ndiscrimination it evokes. In contrast, other philosophers claim that\ndisability is fundamentally different from race and gender in that it\nnecessarily reduces well-being: even in a utopian world of\nnon-discrimination, people with blindness, deafness or paraplegia\nwould be worse off than their able-bodied counterparts. This is but\none example of the many ways that disability generates philosophical\ndebate about some of our most familiar ethical, political, and\nepistemological concepts.\n\n\nThis introductory entry will outline the prevailing definitions and\nmodels of disability, and discuss the epistemic and moral authority of\nthe experiences and self-reports of people classified as disabled.\n\n\nThe definition of disability is highly contentious for several\nreasons. First, it is only in the past century that the term\n“disability” has been used to refer to a distinct class of\npeople. Historically, “disability” has been used either as\na synonym for “inability” or as a reference to legally\nimposed limitations on rights and powers. Indeed, as late as 2006, the\nOxford English Dictionary recognized only these two senses of the term\n(Boorse, 2010). As a result, it is hard to settle questions about the\nmeaning of “disability” by appeal to intuitions, since\nintuitions may be confused by the interplay between older,\nordinary-language definitions and newer, specialized ones. \nSecond, many different characteristics are considered disabilities.\nParaplegia, deafness, blindness, diabetes, autism, epilepsy,\ndepression, and HIV have all been classified as\n“disabilities.” The term covers such diverse conditions as\nthe congenital absence or adventitious loss of a limb or a sensory\nfunction; progressive neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis;\nchronic diseases like arteriosclerosis; the inability or limited\nability to perform such cognitive functions as remembering faces or\ncalculating sums; and psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and\nbipolar disorder. There seems to be little about the functional or\nexperiential states of people with these various conditions to justify\na common concept; indeed, there is at least as much variation among\n“disabled” people with respect to their experiences and\nbodily states as there is among people who lack disabilities. Indeed,\nsome have questioned, in part because of this variation, whether the\nconcept of disability can do much philosophical work (Beaudry,\n2016). \nAt the same time, defining “disability” solely in terms of\nsocial responses like stigmatization and exclusion does not\ndistinguish disability from race or sex (Bickenbach, 1993)—a\nresult that some disability scholars might welcome, but that begs, or\nobscures, an important question. The challenge of distinguishing\n“disability” from other concepts, without taking a\nsimplistic or reductive view of it, has been taken up by various\nspecialized definitions. \nTwo common features stand out in most official definitions of\ndisability, such as those in the World Health Organization (2001;\n1980), the U.N. Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities\nfor People with Disabilities, the Disability Discrimination Act\n(U.K.), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (U.S.) : (i) a\nphysical or mental characteristic labeled or perceived as an\nimpairment or dysfunction (in the remainder of this entry, we will\nrefer to such characteristics as “impairments,” without\nassuming the objectivity or validity of that label) and (ii) some\npersonal or social limitation associated with that impairment. The\nclassification of a physical or mental variation as an impairment may\nbe statistical, based on the average in some reference groups;\nbiological, based on a theory of human functioning; or normative,\nbased on a view of human flourishing. However classified, impairments\nare generally seen as traits of the individual that he or she\ncannot readily alter. Just what makes a condition a trait or attribute\nof an individual is obscure and debatable, but there seems to be\nagreement on clear cases (Kahane and Savulescu, 2009). Thus, poverty\nis not seen as an impairment, however disabling it may be, nor is\ntasteless clothing, even if it is a manifestation of impaired\nfashion-sense rather than scarce income. On the other hand, diseases\nare generally classified as impairments, even though they are rarely\npermanent or static conditions. Diseases that are not long-lasting,\nhowever, such as the flu and the measles, do not count as\nimpairments. \nThe notion of a limitation is broad and elastic, encompassing\nrestrictions on such “basic” actions as lifting one's arm\n(Nordenfelt, 1997; compare Amundson, 1992: actions “at the level\nof the person”); on more complex physical activities such as\ndressing and toileting; and on social activities like working,\nlearning or voting (see Wasserman, 2001). \nThe characterization of both features is disputed. Several scholars\nhave challenged the prevailing view of impairment as objective and\nbiologically grounded (Shakespeare, 2006; Davis, 2002; Tremain, 2001;\nAmundson 2000). There is also disagreement about the conceptual and\npractical need for two categories of limitations, one involving\npersonal activity, the other social or political\nparticipation—“disability” and\n“handicap,” respectively (Wright, 1983; Edwards, 1997;\nNordenfelt, 1997; Altman, 2001). But the most controversial issue in\ndefining disability is the relationship between the two. At one\nextreme are definitions that imply, or are read to imply, that\nbiological impairments are the sole causes of limitation. The\ndefinitions in the World Health Organization's 1980 International\nClassification of Impairment, Disability, and Handicap, and the\nDisability Discrimination Act (UK) have been interpreted this way. At\nthe other extreme are definitions that attribute the limitations faced\nby disabled people solely to “contemporary social\norganization,” such as the definition given by the Union of the\nPhysically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS, 1976). Such\ndefinitions appear to treat impairments merely as\n“evocative” causes—as conditions that are subject to\nexclusion and oppression. They have been criticized for ignoring\ndisadvantages that cannot be attributed to social attitudes and\npractices (Terzi, 2009, 2004; Shakespeare, 2006). But in\ncharacterizing disability in terms of exclusion, these definitions\nneed not deny that impairments have undesirable aspects, such as pain\nor discomfort—merely that those aspects are not within the\nscope, or part of the meaning, of disability. \nIn-between are definitions which assert that individual impairment and\nthe social environment are jointly sufficient causes of\nlimitation. Perhaps the best-known example is the WHO's International\nClassification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF, 2001),\nwhich emphasizes that disability is a “dynamic interaction\nbetween health conditions and environmental and personal\nfactors.” Such interactive definitions predominate in current\nlaw and commentary on disability; even the ICIDH and DDA can be\ninterpreted as compatible with this approach. The ADA is generally\nseen as adopting an interactive approach to disability, although it\ncontains an amalgam of definitional features. \nThese different understandings of the relationship of impairment to\nlimitation inform two contrasting approaches to disability, often\ndescribed as opposing models: the medical and social. The medical\nmodel understands a disability as a physical or mental impairment\nof the individual and its personal and social consequences. It regards\nthe limitations faced by people with disabilities as resulting\nprimarily, or solely, from their impairments. In contrast, the\nsocial model understands disability as a relation between an\nindividual and her social environment: the exclusion of people with\ncertain physical and mental characteristics from major domains of\nsocial life. Their exclusion is manifested not only in deliberate\nsegregation, but in a built environment and organized social activity\nthat preclude or restrict the participation of people seen or labelled\nas having disabilities. \nIn their extreme forms, the medical and social models serve to chart\nthe space of possible relationships between impairment and limitation\nmore than to reflect the actual views of individuals or institutions.\n(A variety of more formal models, described in Altman, 2001,\ngraphically represent the causal complexity of disability.) The\nmedical model is rarely defended but often adopted unreflectively by\nhealth care professionals, bioethicists, and philosophers who ignore\nor underestimate the contribution of social and other environmental\nfactors to the limitations faced by people with disabilities. \nA variety of social models are embraced by disability scholars and\nactivists in and outside of philosophy. The “British social\nmodel” associated with the UPIAS (1976) definition quoted above\nappears to deny any causal role to impairment in disability. As\nsuggested, however, that denial may best be seen as limiting the scope\nof “disability” to the effects of exclusion and\ndiscrimination (Beaudry, 2016), or as rhetorical, countering the\nprevailing emphasis on biological causes of disadvantage. More\nmoderate versions of the social model maintain the emphasis on social\ncauses while insisting on the interactive character of disability\n(e.g., Bickenbach 1993; Altman, 2001). Taking the poor fit between\natypical embodiment and standard environments as their starting point,\nthey treat disability as an interaction between biological and social\ncauses, denying causal priority to either. \nImplicit in the UPIAS definition of disability are two ways that\nsociety imposes limitations on disabled people, corresponding to two\ndistinct strands of the social model. When the UPIAS claims that\nsociety “excludes” people with impairments, this suggests\nthe minority group model, which sees people with impairments\nas a minority subject to stigmatization and exclusion. On this view,\nthe main reason people with disabilities encounter hardship is because\nthey suffer discrimination along the same lines as racial or ethnic\nminorities. Accordingly, civil rights protections and\nanti-discrimination laws are the proper responses to disability (e.g.,\nHahn, 1997 and Oliver, 1990). Perhaps the most familiar expression of\nthe minority-group model is found in the preamble to the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act, which describes people with disabilities as\n“a discrete and insular minority”—an explicit\ninvocation of the legal characterization of racial minorities. \nThe UPIAS also asserts that “contemporary social\norganization” fails to “take into account” people\nwith disabilities. This suggests the human variation model,\naccording to which many of the challenges faced by disabled people do\nnot result from their deliberate exclusion, but from a mismatch\nbetween their characteristics and the physical and social environment.\nOn this view, disability is “an extension of the variability in\nphysical and mental attributes beyond the present—but not the\npotential—ability of social institutions to routinely\nrespond” (Scotch and Schriner, 1997). This view of disabilities\nas human variations is closely related to the view that disability is\na universal human condition (Zola, 1989) or shared human identity\n(Davis, 2002, Ch. 1). The claim that disability is universal can be\ntaken as nothing more than a prediction that we will all acquire\nfamiliar disabilities at some time in our lives. But that claim is\nbetter construed as one about the nature of disability; as maintaining\nthat all human beings have physical or mental variations that can\nbecome a source of vulnerability or disadvantage in some settings. \nThese two versions of the social model are not incompatible, differing\nmainly in emphasis. The discrimination stressed by the minority group\nmodel generally leads to, and is expressed in, the societal failure to\naccommodate people with various differences. In some contexts, it is\nappropriate to analogize people with disabilities to racial\nminorities; in others, it is important to reject a dichotomy between\ndisability and normality and treat impairments as continuous\nvariations. If one goal of social policy is to remove discrimination\nand its enduring disadvantages, another is to encompass the full range\nof human variation in the design of the physical environment and\nsocial practices. \nAlthough the social model, in one version or another, is now the\ndominant legislative, social-science, and humanities paradigm for\nunderstanding disability, stronger versions, particularly the British\nSocial Model, have been subject to extensive criticism. Some argue\nthat an adequate conceptualization of disability requires a\nrecognition of impairments as an objective basis for classification,\nto distinguish disability discrimination from other types of\ndiscrimination (Bickenbach, 1993). Several critics argue that extreme\nversions of the model implausibly deny or understate the role of\nimpairment itself as a source of disadvantage (Anastasiou and\nKauffman, 2013; Terzi, 2009, 2004; Shakespeare, 2006). Others,\nhowever, contend that this criticism is misplaced, because the British\nSocial Model does not deny the importance of impairments but rather\nseeks to restrict the notion of \"disability\" to social exclusion and\noppression (Beaudry, 2016).  \nAnother objection is that the social as well as the medical model both\nrest on a false dichotomy between biological impairments and social\nlimitations. There are two versions of this objection. One maintains\nthat disability is a complex phenomenon, in which biological\nimpairment and social exclusion are deeply interwoven and difficult to\ntease apart (Martiny 2015; Anastasiou and Kauffman, 2013). The other\nversion of this objection rejects the treatment of impairment as a\n(strictly) biological phenomenon. “Impairment,” the\nargument goes, is no less a social construction than the barriers\nfaced by people so classified. Claims that there is a stable\nbiomedical basis for classifying a variation as an impairment are\ncalled into question by shifting classifications; by the\n“medicalization” of some conditions (shyness) and\n“demedicalization” of others (homosexuality). Moreover,\nthe social environment appears to play a significant role in\nidentifying and, arguably, in creating some impairments (dyslexia)\n(Cole, 2007; Shakespeare, 2006; Davis, 2002, Ch 1; Tremain, 2001;\nAmundson, 2000). What counts as an impairment may depend on which\nvariations appear to be disadvantageous in familiar or salient\nenvironments, or on which variations are subject to social prejudice:\nLess-than-average height may be more readily classified as an\nimpairment than greater-than-average height because the former is more\noften disadvantageous in environments designed for people of average\nheight, or because it is generally seen as less desirable. For such\nreasons, it is difficult to establish the objectivity of the\nimpairment classification by appeal to a clear and undisputed\nbiomedical norm. Amundson (2000) goes so far as to deny that there is\nany biological basis for a concept of functional normality—a\nclaim emphatically rejected by Boorse (2010).  \nThe disputed objectivity of the impairment classification is adduced\nby Tremain to argue that impairments “must no longer be\ntheorized as essential biological characteristics (attributes) of a\n‘real’ body on which recognizably disabling conditions are\nimposed” (2001, 632). Rather, she argues that being classified\nas having an impairment is an integral part of the social process of\ndisablement. Such criticism parallels the debate among gender\ntheorists about whether we can distinguish sex from gender on the\nground that gender is socially constructed whereas sex is not. [See\nthe SEP entry on “Feminist Perspectives on Sex and\nGender.”]  \nThus, some critics conclude that it is at best oversimplified and at\nworst futile to distinguish biological impairments from social\nlimitations, or to attempt to separate and compare the biological and\nsocial contributions to the disadvantages of people with disabilities\nBut even those who believe that the impairment classification can be\ndefended in biomedical terms recognize that impairments are not merely\nbiologically-defined atypicalities but also markers for\ndiscrimination—discrimination that may be reinforced by the\nconviction that it is a response to objective biological attributes.\nAnita Silvers (2003) has argued that a it is both possible and\ndesirable to construct a neutral, value-free model of disability,\nusing strictly descriptive criteria to identify atypical forms and\nfunctions, thereby allowing scholars with conflicting views to debate\ntheir normative and policy significance.  \nThe medical and social models suggest (although they do not imply)\ndifferent views about the impact of disability on well-being, and\ndifferent views about how disability is relevant to reproductive\ndecisions, medical interventions, and social policy. Those who accept\na social model of disability regard the association between disability\nand well-being as highly contingent, mediated by a variety of\nenvironmental and social factors. They question conceptions of\nwell-being that give a central role to the possession or exercise of\nthe standard array of physical and mental functions, as those\nconceptions imply, or are often taken to imply, that well-being is\nprecluded or diminished merely by the absence or limitation of those\nfunctions. [see SEP entry (forthcoming) on “Disability: Health,\nWell-Being, and Personal Relationships”] As a result, they\ngenerally see the disadvantages of disability not only as externally\ncaused, but as less formidable than they appear to people who view\ndisability in largely biomedical terms. These differences are\nreflected in the conflicting assessments of life with disabilities\nfound in the bioethics and public policy literature on the one hand,\nand disability scholarship on the other (contrast Brock, 2005 with\nGoering, 2008). \nThe different models of disability also seem to favor different\nresponses to disability. The medical model appears to support the\ncorrection of the biological condition or some form of compensation\nwhen that is impractical; the minority group model appears to favor\nmeasures to eliminate or compensate for exclusionary practices and\nrecognize their injustice; the human variation model appears to favor\nreconstruction of the physical and social environment to take into\naccount a wider range of differences in human structure and function.\nImportantly, such reconstruction may also be supported by the minority\ngroup model as an antidiscrimination measure, since that model views\nexclusionary environments and practices as the characteristic form of\ndiscrimination against people with disabilities. The human variation\nmodel may just make explicit the appropriate social response to\ndisability in a society without exclusion or discrimination. \nBut claims about the causes of disadvantage do not always yield\nstraightforward prescriptions for their remediation (Wasserman, 2001;\nSamaha, 2007). In some cases, medical or surgical\n“correction” may be the most effective way to escape\ndiscrimination; if correction is not appropriate, that is because it\nreinforces discriminatory attitudes and practices. The proper response\nto the disadvantages associated with disability depends not only on\ncausal attributions but also on moral judgments about responsibility,\nrespect, justice. The debates over cleft lip surgery and breast\nreconstruction after mastectomy are not only about the comparative\nimportance of biological and social factors in making the treated\nconditions disadvantageous. They also concern whether those\ninterventions are justifiable uses of scarce medical resources, and\nwhether they are complicit with suspect norms (Little, 1998), as in\nthe case of skin-lighteners for people of color (Asch, 2006). \nAlthough it is subject to dispute and qualification, the distinction\nbetween biological impairment and social limitation is relevant to\nmany normative and policy issues, especially those concerning the\nchoice between measures that modify the disabled individual or alter\nhis environment. In this section, we consider the role of that\ndistinction in addressing the critical question of how the experiences\nof people with disabilities are relevant to those issues. The\ndisability rights movement has long complained that the perspectives\nof people with disabilities are too often ignored or discounted. The\nslogan that served as the title for James Charlton's 1998 book,\nNothing About Us Without Us (Charlton, 1998; Stone, 1997) has\noften been invoked to demand the inclusion of people with disabilities\nin policy making and research concerning disability. The slogan\nsuggests that they have both a unique perspective to bring to those\nactivities and a right to take part in them. But what is the\n“us” to whom the slogan refers? Do persons with different\ndisabling traits have enough in common to claim that there is a\n“disability perspective” to bring to bear on policy and\nresearch? \nSuch questions are best approached in terms of the two aspects of\nimpairments recognized by most disability theorists: as structural or\nfunctional atypicalities, and as markers for discrimination. These two\naspects of impairment roughly correspond with two distinct types of\ndisability experience: \nThere may be more commonalities in one kind of experience than the\nother, and greater relevance to specific research or policy issues.\nFurther, the epistemic and moral authority of statements made by\npeople with disabilities about their experiences may vary with the\nkind of experience they describe. \nThe first type of experience involves the particularities of living\nwith atypical embodiment or functioning. Questions about this kind of\nexperience are often framed as what-is-it like questions: “What\nis it like to” have moderate or profound deafness? use a\nwheelchair to move? be legally or totally blind? be unable to hold or\nmanipulate objects with one's hands? have atypical speech? have a\nlearning disability or a mood disorder? Such questions are sometimes\nrequests for factual information about how one manages tasks with\none's disability—“how do you do x if you are in a\nwheelchair?” In other cases, they are requests for self-reports\nabout the phenomenological experience of being in a particular\nstate—“what does it feel like to get around in a\n wheelchair?”[2] \nPeople accustomed to their impairments may have little to report about\n“what it feels like” to have them, in part because absence\nof a function or a sense may not be something they experience as such,\nand because their atypical ways of functioning or sensing may not, in\nthemselves, be affect-laden—it is what they do\nunself-consciously, until it is called to their attention. The\nexperience of atypical functioning or sensing may be far more salient\nfor someone getting to know a person with a disability than it is to\nthe person herself. It may also be highly salient to a person who is\nrecently impaired, trying to function without limbs or senses that she\nused to have. But the experience of loss and frustration becomes less\nsalient with time, peer and professional support, as she gets more\nimmersed in going about day-to-day\n life.[3] \nEven when people with disabilities do report about what “it is\nlike” to have their impairments, those reports may vary\nconsiderably. The most obvious reason is that there is tremendous\nvariation in the sensory, physical and functional states of which\n“impaired” or “disabled” people are capable. A\nperson who can see but not hear has very different sensory experiences\nfrom a person who can hear but not see, who in turn has very different\nexperiences from a person who can see and hear but cannot move his\nlegs. This point should be obvious, but it is worth stressing, because\nit underscores the fact that the labels “disabled” and\n“impaired” do not track a distinct phenomenological\nexperience. \nMoreover, even two people with the same impairment label might give\ndifferent reports of how they do things or how they feel as they go\nabout life with their impairment This could be due partly to\ndifferences in the character or extent of their impairment—not\nall people labeled “deaf” are deaf to the same extent.\nFurther, their experience of life with an impairment may vary with the\nkinds of activity they engage in, and how they regard their\nimpairments as affecting their opportunities for self-fulfillment.\nOpportunities in turn may be influenced by all the factors, unrelated\nto impairment, that affect everyone: the family and neighborhood in\nwhich one grows up or now lives; one's disposition or personality; the\nfinancial resources at one's disposal; or one's education, religion,\nsex, or race. Moreover, people's experience of living with an atypical\nfunction sometimes may be difficult to distinguish from their\nexperience of stigma and discrimination. \nDespite these differences, the experiences of living with diverse\nimpairments have one thing in common—they are likely to be\nignored, or given insufficient weight, in the design of the physical\nand social environment. Unlike new acquaintances, planners and policy\nmakers may pay little attention to “what it is like” to\nget around with atypical functions. In constructing buildings, transit\nsystems, and work schedules, they often fail to listen carefully to\nwhat people with various impairments say about their experiences of\ndaily living. Those experiences cannot be adequately simulated by\nspending a day in a wheelchair or walking around with a\nblindfold—indeed, the confusion and disorientation that\nnondisabled people experience in simulating impairments is a very\nmisleading guide to the way people with disabilities experience and\nnegotiate the activities of daily living. Moreover, in learning about\nthe experiences of living with atypical functions, planners and policy\nmakers cannot take any single impairment as representative. The\nexperiences of people with different impairments differ as much from\neach other as they do from the experiences of nondisabled people. As\nthe human variation model emphasizes, the very diversity of\nimpairments poses an important challenge for an inclusive society. \nIf “baby boomers” who have not learned electronic\ncommunication become a despised, as opposed to merely statistical,\nminority, and if, as a result, they become cut off from friends and\nacquaintances who rely on email and social media for long-distance\ncommunication, and who dismiss them as luddites and fogeys, they will\nlearn something about the social construction of disability. They will\nlearn even more if they cannot cross the “digital divide”\nor can do so only at considerable economic cost or cognitive strain,\nor if they are still regarded as luddites and fogeys even when they\ndo. They will experience something of the stigma and discrimination\nthat cut across impairments. \nThe second type of disability experience, then, is of attitudinal\nbarriers to ordinary activity that are facts of life for people with\ndisabilities. According to the social model, which highlights these\nbarriers, the “disability experience” that links people\nwith cystic fibrosis to people with epilepsy, learning disabilities,\nor cerebral palsy is one of having to deal daily with the largely\nnegative responses of others. These negative responses involve several\nelements. The most discussed is overt stigmatization and\ndiscrimination: being treated as a social outcast, losing out on jobs,\nfriends, or partners, because other people do not want to interact\nwith a person with a disability, or enduring grossly inadequate\naccommodation because reasonable accommodation is thought too costly\nor troublesome. \nBut there are also less overt ways that society makes living with a\ndisability difficult. Simply being different from the majority of the\npopulation, in a way that the majority makes salient, can make people\nwith disabilities feel isolated or alienated. This experience is\nsimilar to those not only of other stigmatized minorities, such as\nAfrican-Americans or LGBTs, but of people with atypical\ncharacteristics who may not form a distinct political or cultural\nminority but are nonetheless constantly reminded of their difference.\nFor example, people whose spouses have died and older adults who are\nsingle for whatever reason may feel excluded from social events\nintended for couples, or face the presumption that they have a\n(usually opposite-sex) partner (“And what does your husband\ndo?”). \nIt is in the social construction of disability that we move from the\nparticularity of any one disability toward the common social\nexperiences of people with disabilities. Stigma, discrimination, and\nimputations of difference and inferiority are all parts of the social\nexperience of disability. Being greeted at a party or a conference not\nby “hello” but by “do you need any help?” and\nhaving virtually every aspect of one's interests, tastes, and\npersonality attributed to one's disability are also parts of the\ndisability experience. As one writer describes it, if he cooks it is\nbecause he doesn't want to be seen in public; if he eats in\nrestaurants it is because he can't cook (Brickner, 1976). Disability\nbecomes a “master status,” preventing people from playing\nany adult social role and eclipsing sex, race, age, occupation, or\nfamily (Goffman, 1963; Gliedman and Roth, 1980). Many nondisabled\npeople assume that people with disabilities won't make good partners\nand cannot or should not become parents (Safilios-Rothschild, 1970;\nShakespeare, 1996; Asch and Fine, 1988; Wates, 1997). People with\ndisabilities are perceived to be globally helpless based on their need\nfor assistance with some facets of daily life (Wright, 1983), fueling\nthe conviction that they are unable to render the help needed for\nsuccessful partnership or parenting. Most nondisabled people, after\nall, are not told that they are inspirations simply for giving the\ncorrect change at the drugstore. Perhaps there would not even be a\n“disability experience” in a world without the daily\nindignities, barriers, and prejudices that characterize life with\ndisability almost anywhere. \nJust as there is great variation in how members of racial and sexual\nminorities experience stigmatization, however, disabled people's\nexperience also varies. In claiming that the experience of stigma\nunites disabled people, we must be careful to acknowledge those\ndifferences. For example, a major source of variation is whether the\ndisability is visible or invisible (Davis, 2005; Banks and Kaschak,\n2003). Whereas visibly disabled people must deal with being instantly\nclassified as “different” and inferior, people with\ninvisible disabilities are often placed in the stressful and\nexhausting position of having to convince others that they are\n“really” disabled and not asking for special treatment.\nThe alternative is to keep quiet and forgo needed assistance, which\ncarries other costs, such as the stress of keeping a secret or trying\nto decide if a particular disclosure is safe (Schneider and Conrad,\n1985; Davis, 2005). \nIn addition, disabled people who are also members of other stigmatized\ngroups may experience a distinct kind of stigmatization that is\n“more than the sum of its parts.” For example, disabled\nwomen are disproportionately affected by society's obsession with body\nimage: they must confront not only sexism and prejudice against\ndisabled people, but a particularly virulent combination of the two\nthat stigmatizes women who do not fulfill a narrow ideal of feminine\nbeauty (Crawford and Ostrove, 2003) or are thought incapable of\nperforming the stereotypically female role of nurturer (Asch and Fine,\n1988). In a similar way, both African-Americans and disabled people\nare frequently stereotyped as dependent or ineffectual. And so\nAfrican-Americans who are also disabled face a particularly high\nburden in overcoming these stereotypes. \nMoreover, some would argue that to the extent that people with\ndisabilities have distinct and common experiences, they are due to\nembodiment as well as stigmatization. A disputed but much-discussed\nstrand of feminist philosophy holds that the experience of being\nfemale differs in important ways from being male, regardless of\ncultural position, discrimination, or political and economic power. On\nthis view, women differ in some important ways from men because of the\nbiology of femaleness and of childbearing, and those differences\nshould be seen as gateways into philosophical and moral understanding\n(Whitbeck, 1972). Discussions of “race” are similarly\ncomplex: is the experience of “race” entirely socially\nconstructed, or is there a biological component after all? (See\ngenerally APA Newsletter on the Black Experience, 2000).\nDebates about the experience of disability can be enriched by\nunderstanding these debates about other minority groups, even if\ndisability differs in significant respects. On the one hand, the\nbiological reality of many significant impairments affects the\nexperience of those with the impairments. On the other hand, different\nimpairments shape experience in very different ways. Clearly,\n“the experience of disability” is complex, and usefully\ncompared to the experience of other stigmatized minorities. \nThe first-hand experience of stigmatization may confer two sorts of\nauthority on people with disabilities. The first is epistemic. There\nshould be “nothing about us without us” because any\ndiscussion of, or research into, disability not informed by that\nexperience would likely be inaccurate and misguided. For example,\ndiscussions of well-being that do not take into account the\nperspective of disabled people may assume that their level of\nhappiness or satisfaction is much lower than it in fact is, or that it\nis lower mainly because of difficulties directly attributable to\nimpairments rather than to attitudes and social barriers. This is but\none application of the more general issue of first-person authority:\nthe extent to which people have special or privileged knowledge of\ntheir own mental states and experiences [see SEP entry on\n“Self-Knowledge”]. Although this is a subject of great\ncontroversy in the philosophy of mind, there is widespread agreement\nthat, at minimum, first-person ascriptions of mental states carry a\ndefeasible presumption of correctness. \nBut there is an additional epistemic reason for according significant\nweight to the first-hand reports of people with disabilities. The\nobservations and judgments of all stigmatized minorities are\nfrequently discounted, but people with disabilities face a distinct\nhandicap. There is a powerful, pervasive tendency among philosophers,\nsocial scientists, and laypeople to dismiss their self-appraisals as\nreflecting ignorance, self-deception, defensive exaggeration, or\ncourageous optimism [see SEP entry on “Feminist Perspectives on\nDisability”, Sec. 3]. Giving those self-appraisals heightened\nattention and deference may be an appropriate and effective way to\ncounteract or correct for that tendency. \nEpistemic authority thus provides a good reason for encouraging\ndisabled people to speak about their experiences and for nondisabled\npeople to listen when they do. But there is another reason as well:\npeople who suffer stigmatization, disrespect, and discrimination have\na moral claim to be heard that is independent of the accuracy of their\ntestimony. Even if someone lacking those experiences could convey them\naccurately and vividly, she would not be an adequate substitute for\nthose who had the experiences. The experience of stigmatization, like\nthe experience of other forms of oppression, calls for recognition,\nand thereby may impose a duty on those fortunate enough to have\navoided such experiences to listen closely to those who have had them.\nTo settle for second-hand accounts of those experiences or to ignore\nthem altogether seems disrespectful to the victims. The conviction\nthat the oppressed have a right to a hearing lies behind the recent\nproliferation of Truth Commissions and tribunals. It also helps\nexplain the frustration of crime and torture victims denied an\nopportunity to tell their stories, even when their oppressors receive\npunishment without their testimony. Though few disability advocates\nwould demand a tribunal for the routine indignities of life with\ndisabilities in developed countries, most demand a far greater voice\nin the media depiction of people with disabilities, in research about\nthem, and in policies concerning or affecting them. \nAt the same time, there are several dangers associated with placing\ntoo much emphasis on the moral privilege of victims of stigmatization.\nFirst, there is the danger of defining people by their oppression. The\nvictims may not want to be spokespeople or witnesses, or not for very\nlong; they may want to move on. It is important to recognize both the\nmoral authority of victims to testify and their prerogative to decline\nthat role. \nSecond, emphasizing the moral privilege of the stigmatized may obscure\ndifferences in the experience of stigmatization, and in the sort of\nauthority it confers. As we have seen, there is tremendous variation\nin the ways that disabled people experience stigma, although certain\nbroad generalizations may hold. \nThird, in conferring privilege on those who experience particular\nforms of oppression, we may obscure or slight the shared vulnerability\nof all human beings. For example, Ruth Anna Putnam champions social\nimprovements for women and other disadvantaged people but is wary of a\nparticularist feminist theory of justice, which may fail to emphasize\ncommonality of human experience and human need (Putnam, 1995). Might a\nsimilar wariness be warranted for disability? If, as Scotch and\nSchriner (1997) point out, we had a philosophy and public policy based\non common human needs, we might be able to get rid of “special\nneeds” and focus on multiple methods of meeting common ones,\nwith no negative shadow cast on any of those varied methods. \nFurther, when only the marginalized are asked to share their\n“experiences,” the experiences of the dominant group are\nleft unarticulated, unexamined, and unexplored. Once we argue that\npeople with disabilities need to be heard in bioethics and policy\ndebates as they describe the values and difficulties in their lives,\nwe should also be arguing for experiential accounts of the dominant\ngroup. When dominants examine their own experiences, they might see\nsimilarities to as well as differences from those who have been\nmarginalized. Both groups might benefit as a result. \nThe final danger in emphasizing the experience of stigmatization is\nthat it will exclude the voices of many people classified as having\ndisabilities but who do not see themselves as disabled or stigmatized.\nPeople with disabilities include millions who do not tend to speak in\nsocial model terms and who may not typically speak to their social, as\nopposed to their medical situation (although they do file\ndiscrimination complaints under the ADA when they think it\nappropriate). People who have back problems, cancer histories,\nParkinson's disease, Type II diabetes, stroke, emphysema, forms of\ndementia, mood disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse, or HIV do not\ntypically count themselves as part of the “disability\ncommunity.” The case for including such people is based in part\non the shared experience of socially-mediated exclusion. For example,\na person who has difficulty breathing because of emphysema and cannot\nvisit friends because she cannot walk to a distant bus stop is\ndisadvantaged by social organization in an analogous way to the person\nwith paraplegia who can't meet friends in inaccessible\nrestaurants. \nSuch inclusiveness, however, requires an acceptance of diverse\nattitudes and opinions. Even if the majority of people we would\nclassify as having disabilities perceived societal mistreatment and\ninstitutional barriers to be more oppressive than their diagnoses, not\nall of them would share that view or agree on the best response.\nAfrican-Americans have different views about affirmative action, and\nmany women do not believe that the option of legal abortion is\nessential for women's full participation in society. Disability\ntheorists can find it frustrating that most nondisabled people in\nbioethics dispute their claims about their experience, but those\ntheorists must respond to whatever challenge to the social model is\nposed by people with disabilities who see their condition, and not\nsociety, as the major impediment to their living rewarding lives. Many\npeople with both congenital and acquired disabilities have said that\nthey don't want cures but do want societal change, but that hardly\nwarrants the charge that Christopher Reeve wasn't speaking from his\nexperience of disability when he argued that what he wanted was\n“cure” and not social change (Johnson, 2003; Shakespeare,\n2006). \nLet us grant that a large number of people with particular impairments\nwill say at least some similar things about life with those\nimpairments, especially concerning stigma and discrimination. We are\nstill left with complex questions about what uses to make of such\nexperience in shaping public policy. \nClearly, one critical role is educational. Forty years ago plenty of\nwell-meaning men wondered why women objected to having doors held for\nthem, or to the exclusive use of male pronouns to refer to humans\ngenerally. Language, social conventions, and many aspects of life have\nchanged because men listened to women's accounts of how seemingly\ninnocuous acts felt, and of why those acts held not-so-innocuous\nimplications for their self-realization and social participation.\n“Why is that person on crutches so offended when I ask him if\nhe's traveling alone?” says the flight attendant who doesn't ask\nthe same question of his nondisabled seatmate. Why doesn't the man who\nis blind let it go when a cab driver won't take his money? A\nnondisabled person may think it would be great not to pay the\noutrageous fare as the meter climbs in New York City traffic. \nThe educational value in explaining the daily experience of stigma\ngoes far beyond “sensitivity training.” In making\nnondisabled people aware of how much of “the burden of\ndisability” arises from routine, seemingly innocuous social\ninteractions, people with disabilities can help to convince them that\nthe direct or internal effects of their various impairments are not\nnearly as bad as imagined. \nTaking the experiences of disabled people seriously may also have\nimportant implications for health policy. As is apparent in many\nbioethical and policy discussions, most nondisabled people, including\nhealth professionals, imagine the experience of disability to be far\nworse than reported by the disabled themselves (Basnett, 2001 and\nGill, 2000). This gap is not explainable solely by the limited contact\nbetween the two groups. In developing a plan for Medicaid rationing in\nOregon in the early 1990s, nondisabled people ranked treatments to\nsustain the lives of people with quadriplegia as of very low priority\nbecause of their presumed low quality of life (Menzel, 1992); people\nwith quadriplegia complained that they had been left out of the\nsurveys and that their appreciation of their lives had not informed\nthe ranking process. Such serious policy errors might\nhave been avoided by a recognition that people with disabilities had\nthe same epistemic authority as nondisabled people to assess the\nquality of their lives. \nThe varied experiences of functioning with an impairment may have a\nmore modest role to play in policy deliberations than the common\nexperiences of stigma and discrimination. But that role is still an\nimportant one. In designing buildings, transit systems, and other\npublic and private facilities, and in establishing norms of conduct in\nschools and workplaces, we need to know a lot about how people with\natypical functions get around and get along. It is not enough to\nensure that the width of a doorway exceeds the width of a standard\nwheelchair; it is also important to find out about the preferences of\nwheelchair mobilizers before and after they enter a building. This\nkind of information is no different from that routinely elicited from\nnondisabled people in designing facilities. But it requires the\nrepresentation of people with a wide array of impairments, and it\nrequires respectful attention to the minutiae of their daily\nlives.","contact.mail":"jblustein@ccny.cuny.edu","contact.domain":"ccny.cuny.edu"},{"date.published":"2011-12-16","date.changed":"2016-05-23","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disability/","author1":"David Wasserman","author2":"Adrienne Asch","author1.info":"https://philosophy.dartmouth.edu/people/daniel-putnam","entry":"disability","body.text":"\n\n\nPhilosophers have always lived among people who could not see, walk,\nor hear; who had limited mobility, comprehension or longevity, or\nchronic illnesses of various sorts. And yet philosophical interest in\nthese conditions was piecemeal and occasional until the past hundred\nor so years. Some of these conditions were cited in litanies of life's\nhardships or evils; some were the vehicle for inquiries into the\nrelationship between human faculties and human knowledge [see SEP\nentry on “Molyneux's Problem”]. But the treatment of\ndisability as a subject of philosophical interest is relatively\nnew.\n\n\nThe lack of attention to “disability” or\n“impairment” in general may have a simple explanation:\nthere were no such concepts to attend to until 19th century\nscientific thinking put variations in human function and form into\ncategories of abnormality and deviance. Once such categories were\nestablished, it became possible to talk, and generalize, about\n“the disabled,” and philosophers have done so for various\npurposes (Hacking, 1990; Davis, 2002, Ch. 4)). The resurgent political\nphilosophy of the second half of the last century, preoccupied with\neliminating or reducing unearned disadvantages, tended to treat\ndisability as a primary source of those disadvantages, to be addressed\nwith medical correction or government compensation. Somewhat later,\nsocial philosophers began to see disability as a source both of\ndiscrimination and oppression, and of group identity, akin to race or\nsex in these respects.\n\n\nIn some ways, disability looks much like sex or race as a\nphilosophical topic. It concerns the classification of people on the\nbasis of observed or inferred characteristics. It raises difficult\nthreshold questions about the extent to which the classification is\nbased on biology or is socially constructed. And yet the strong\nphilosophical interest in some of the characteristics on which the\ndisability classification is based appears to accord them a\nsignificance that many would deny to the distinguishing\ncharacteristics of sex or race.\n\n\nConsider, for example, the question of how well-being is affected by\nthe characteristics on which the disability classification is based.\nThere is little interest now in the question of whether, in a world\nwithout discrimination, blacks or women would do better or worse on\nvarious metrics of well-being than whites or men. In contrast, there\nis considerable interest in this question when the subject is people\nwith\n disabilities.[1]\n Some philosophers and disability scholars claim that the answer is no\ndifferent than in the case of race or sex: to the extent that\ndisability reduces well-being, it is because of the stigma and\ndiscrimination it evokes. In contrast, other philosophers claim that\ndisability is fundamentally different from race and gender in that it\nnecessarily reduces well-being: even in a utopian world of\nnon-discrimination, people with blindness, deafness or paraplegia\nwould be worse off than their able-bodied counterparts. This is but\none example of the many ways that disability generates philosophical\ndebate about some of our most familiar ethical, political, and\nepistemological concepts.\n\n\nThis introductory entry will outline the prevailing definitions and\nmodels of disability, and discuss the epistemic and moral authority of\nthe experiences and self-reports of people classified as disabled.\n\n\nThe definition of disability is highly contentious for several\nreasons. First, it is only in the past century that the term\n“disability” has been used to refer to a distinct class of\npeople. Historically, “disability” has been used either as\na synonym for “inability” or as a reference to legally\nimposed limitations on rights and powers. Indeed, as late as 2006, the\nOxford English Dictionary recognized only these two senses of the term\n(Boorse, 2010). As a result, it is hard to settle questions about the\nmeaning of “disability” by appeal to intuitions, since\nintuitions may be confused by the interplay between older,\nordinary-language definitions and newer, specialized ones. \nSecond, many different characteristics are considered disabilities.\nParaplegia, deafness, blindness, diabetes, autism, epilepsy,\ndepression, and HIV have all been classified as\n“disabilities.” The term covers such diverse conditions as\nthe congenital absence or adventitious loss of a limb or a sensory\nfunction; progressive neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis;\nchronic diseases like arteriosclerosis; the inability or limited\nability to perform such cognitive functions as remembering faces or\ncalculating sums; and psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and\nbipolar disorder. There seems to be little about the functional or\nexperiential states of people with these various conditions to justify\na common concept; indeed, there is at least as much variation among\n“disabled” people with respect to their experiences and\nbodily states as there is among people who lack disabilities. Indeed,\nsome have questioned, in part because of this variation, whether the\nconcept of disability can do much philosophical work (Beaudry,\n2016). \nAt the same time, defining “disability” solely in terms of\nsocial responses like stigmatization and exclusion does not\ndistinguish disability from race or sex (Bickenbach, 1993)—a\nresult that some disability scholars might welcome, but that begs, or\nobscures, an important question. The challenge of distinguishing\n“disability” from other concepts, without taking a\nsimplistic or reductive view of it, has been taken up by various\nspecialized definitions. \nTwo common features stand out in most official definitions of\ndisability, such as those in the World Health Organization (2001;\n1980), the U.N. Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities\nfor People with Disabilities, the Disability Discrimination Act\n(U.K.), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (U.S.) : (i) a\nphysical or mental characteristic labeled or perceived as an\nimpairment or dysfunction (in the remainder of this entry, we will\nrefer to such characteristics as “impairments,” without\nassuming the objectivity or validity of that label) and (ii) some\npersonal or social limitation associated with that impairment. The\nclassification of a physical or mental variation as an impairment may\nbe statistical, based on the average in some reference groups;\nbiological, based on a theory of human functioning; or normative,\nbased on a view of human flourishing. However classified, impairments\nare generally seen as traits of the individual that he or she\ncannot readily alter. Just what makes a condition a trait or attribute\nof an individual is obscure and debatable, but there seems to be\nagreement on clear cases (Kahane and Savulescu, 2009). Thus, poverty\nis not seen as an impairment, however disabling it may be, nor is\ntasteless clothing, even if it is a manifestation of impaired\nfashion-sense rather than scarce income. On the other hand, diseases\nare generally classified as impairments, even though they are rarely\npermanent or static conditions. Diseases that are not long-lasting,\nhowever, such as the flu and the measles, do not count as\nimpairments. \nThe notion of a limitation is broad and elastic, encompassing\nrestrictions on such “basic” actions as lifting one's arm\n(Nordenfelt, 1997; compare Amundson, 1992: actions “at the level\nof the person”); on more complex physical activities such as\ndressing and toileting; and on social activities like working,\nlearning or voting (see Wasserman, 2001). \nThe characterization of both features is disputed. Several scholars\nhave challenged the prevailing view of impairment as objective and\nbiologically grounded (Shakespeare, 2006; Davis, 2002; Tremain, 2001;\nAmundson 2000). There is also disagreement about the conceptual and\npractical need for two categories of limitations, one involving\npersonal activity, the other social or political\nparticipation—“disability” and\n“handicap,” respectively (Wright, 1983; Edwards, 1997;\nNordenfelt, 1997; Altman, 2001). But the most controversial issue in\ndefining disability is the relationship between the two. At one\nextreme are definitions that imply, or are read to imply, that\nbiological impairments are the sole causes of limitation. The\ndefinitions in the World Health Organization's 1980 International\nClassification of Impairment, Disability, and Handicap, and the\nDisability Discrimination Act (UK) have been interpreted this way. At\nthe other extreme are definitions that attribute the limitations faced\nby disabled people solely to “contemporary social\norganization,” such as the definition given by the Union of the\nPhysically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS, 1976). Such\ndefinitions appear to treat impairments merely as\n“evocative” causes—as conditions that are subject to\nexclusion and oppression. They have been criticized for ignoring\ndisadvantages that cannot be attributed to social attitudes and\npractices (Terzi, 2009, 2004; Shakespeare, 2006). But in\ncharacterizing disability in terms of exclusion, these definitions\nneed not deny that impairments have undesirable aspects, such as pain\nor discomfort—merely that those aspects are not within the\nscope, or part of the meaning, of disability. \nIn-between are definitions which assert that individual impairment and\nthe social environment are jointly sufficient causes of\nlimitation. Perhaps the best-known example is the WHO's International\nClassification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF, 2001),\nwhich emphasizes that disability is a “dynamic interaction\nbetween health conditions and environmental and personal\nfactors.” Such interactive definitions predominate in current\nlaw and commentary on disability; even the ICIDH and DDA can be\ninterpreted as compatible with this approach. The ADA is generally\nseen as adopting an interactive approach to disability, although it\ncontains an amalgam of definitional features. \nThese different understandings of the relationship of impairment to\nlimitation inform two contrasting approaches to disability, often\ndescribed as opposing models: the medical and social. The medical\nmodel understands a disability as a physical or mental impairment\nof the individual and its personal and social consequences. It regards\nthe limitations faced by people with disabilities as resulting\nprimarily, or solely, from their impairments. In contrast, the\nsocial model understands disability as a relation between an\nindividual and her social environment: the exclusion of people with\ncertain physical and mental characteristics from major domains of\nsocial life. Their exclusion is manifested not only in deliberate\nsegregation, but in a built environment and organized social activity\nthat preclude or restrict the participation of people seen or labelled\nas having disabilities. \nIn their extreme forms, the medical and social models serve to chart\nthe space of possible relationships between impairment and limitation\nmore than to reflect the actual views of individuals or institutions.\n(A variety of more formal models, described in Altman, 2001,\ngraphically represent the causal complexity of disability.) The\nmedical model is rarely defended but often adopted unreflectively by\nhealth care professionals, bioethicists, and philosophers who ignore\nor underestimate the contribution of social and other environmental\nfactors to the limitations faced by people with disabilities. \nA variety of social models are embraced by disability scholars and\nactivists in and outside of philosophy. The “British social\nmodel” associated with the UPIAS (1976) definition quoted above\nappears to deny any causal role to impairment in disability. As\nsuggested, however, that denial may best be seen as limiting the scope\nof “disability” to the effects of exclusion and\ndiscrimination (Beaudry, 2016), or as rhetorical, countering the\nprevailing emphasis on biological causes of disadvantage. More\nmoderate versions of the social model maintain the emphasis on social\ncauses while insisting on the interactive character of disability\n(e.g., Bickenbach 1993; Altman, 2001). Taking the poor fit between\natypical embodiment and standard environments as their starting point,\nthey treat disability as an interaction between biological and social\ncauses, denying causal priority to either. \nImplicit in the UPIAS definition of disability are two ways that\nsociety imposes limitations on disabled people, corresponding to two\ndistinct strands of the social model. When the UPIAS claims that\nsociety “excludes” people with impairments, this suggests\nthe minority group model, which sees people with impairments\nas a minority subject to stigmatization and exclusion. On this view,\nthe main reason people with disabilities encounter hardship is because\nthey suffer discrimination along the same lines as racial or ethnic\nminorities. Accordingly, civil rights protections and\nanti-discrimination laws are the proper responses to disability (e.g.,\nHahn, 1997 and Oliver, 1990). Perhaps the most familiar expression of\nthe minority-group model is found in the preamble to the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act, which describes people with disabilities as\n“a discrete and insular minority”—an explicit\ninvocation of the legal characterization of racial minorities. \nThe UPIAS also asserts that “contemporary social\norganization” fails to “take into account” people\nwith disabilities. This suggests the human variation model,\naccording to which many of the challenges faced by disabled people do\nnot result from their deliberate exclusion, but from a mismatch\nbetween their characteristics and the physical and social environment.\nOn this view, disability is “an extension of the variability in\nphysical and mental attributes beyond the present—but not the\npotential—ability of social institutions to routinely\nrespond” (Scotch and Schriner, 1997). This view of disabilities\nas human variations is closely related to the view that disability is\na universal human condition (Zola, 1989) or shared human identity\n(Davis, 2002, Ch. 1). The claim that disability is universal can be\ntaken as nothing more than a prediction that we will all acquire\nfamiliar disabilities at some time in our lives. But that claim is\nbetter construed as one about the nature of disability; as maintaining\nthat all human beings have physical or mental variations that can\nbecome a source of vulnerability or disadvantage in some settings. \nThese two versions of the social model are not incompatible, differing\nmainly in emphasis. The discrimination stressed by the minority group\nmodel generally leads to, and is expressed in, the societal failure to\naccommodate people with various differences. In some contexts, it is\nappropriate to analogize people with disabilities to racial\nminorities; in others, it is important to reject a dichotomy between\ndisability and normality and treat impairments as continuous\nvariations. If one goal of social policy is to remove discrimination\nand its enduring disadvantages, another is to encompass the full range\nof human variation in the design of the physical environment and\nsocial practices. \nAlthough the social model, in one version or another, is now the\ndominant legislative, social-science, and humanities paradigm for\nunderstanding disability, stronger versions, particularly the British\nSocial Model, have been subject to extensive criticism. Some argue\nthat an adequate conceptualization of disability requires a\nrecognition of impairments as an objective basis for classification,\nto distinguish disability discrimination from other types of\ndiscrimination (Bickenbach, 1993). Several critics argue that extreme\nversions of the model implausibly deny or understate the role of\nimpairment itself as a source of disadvantage (Anastasiou and\nKauffman, 2013; Terzi, 2009, 2004; Shakespeare, 2006). Others,\nhowever, contend that this criticism is misplaced, because the British\nSocial Model does not deny the importance of impairments but rather\nseeks to restrict the notion of \"disability\" to social exclusion and\noppression (Beaudry, 2016).  \nAnother objection is that the social as well as the medical model both\nrest on a false dichotomy between biological impairments and social\nlimitations. There are two versions of this objection. One maintains\nthat disability is a complex phenomenon, in which biological\nimpairment and social exclusion are deeply interwoven and difficult to\ntease apart (Martiny 2015; Anastasiou and Kauffman, 2013). The other\nversion of this objection rejects the treatment of impairment as a\n(strictly) biological phenomenon. “Impairment,” the\nargument goes, is no less a social construction than the barriers\nfaced by people so classified. Claims that there is a stable\nbiomedical basis for classifying a variation as an impairment are\ncalled into question by shifting classifications; by the\n“medicalization” of some conditions (shyness) and\n“demedicalization” of others (homosexuality). Moreover,\nthe social environment appears to play a significant role in\nidentifying and, arguably, in creating some impairments (dyslexia)\n(Cole, 2007; Shakespeare, 2006; Davis, 2002, Ch 1; Tremain, 2001;\nAmundson, 2000). What counts as an impairment may depend on which\nvariations appear to be disadvantageous in familiar or salient\nenvironments, or on which variations are subject to social prejudice:\nLess-than-average height may be more readily classified as an\nimpairment than greater-than-average height because the former is more\noften disadvantageous in environments designed for people of average\nheight, or because it is generally seen as less desirable. For such\nreasons, it is difficult to establish the objectivity of the\nimpairment classification by appeal to a clear and undisputed\nbiomedical norm. Amundson (2000) goes so far as to deny that there is\nany biological basis for a concept of functional normality—a\nclaim emphatically rejected by Boorse (2010).  \nThe disputed objectivity of the impairment classification is adduced\nby Tremain to argue that impairments “must no longer be\ntheorized as essential biological characteristics (attributes) of a\n‘real’ body on which recognizably disabling conditions are\nimposed” (2001, 632). Rather, she argues that being classified\nas having an impairment is an integral part of the social process of\ndisablement. Such criticism parallels the debate among gender\ntheorists about whether we can distinguish sex from gender on the\nground that gender is socially constructed whereas sex is not. [See\nthe SEP entry on “Feminist Perspectives on Sex and\nGender.”]  \nThus, some critics conclude that it is at best oversimplified and at\nworst futile to distinguish biological impairments from social\nlimitations, or to attempt to separate and compare the biological and\nsocial contributions to the disadvantages of people with disabilities\nBut even those who believe that the impairment classification can be\ndefended in biomedical terms recognize that impairments are not merely\nbiologically-defined atypicalities but also markers for\ndiscrimination—discrimination that may be reinforced by the\nconviction that it is a response to objective biological attributes.\nAnita Silvers (2003) has argued that a it is both possible and\ndesirable to construct a neutral, value-free model of disability,\nusing strictly descriptive criteria to identify atypical forms and\nfunctions, thereby allowing scholars with conflicting views to debate\ntheir normative and policy significance.  \nThe medical and social models suggest (although they do not imply)\ndifferent views about the impact of disability on well-being, and\ndifferent views about how disability is relevant to reproductive\ndecisions, medical interventions, and social policy. Those who accept\na social model of disability regard the association between disability\nand well-being as highly contingent, mediated by a variety of\nenvironmental and social factors. They question conceptions of\nwell-being that give a central role to the possession or exercise of\nthe standard array of physical and mental functions, as those\nconceptions imply, or are often taken to imply, that well-being is\nprecluded or diminished merely by the absence or limitation of those\nfunctions. [see SEP entry (forthcoming) on “Disability: Health,\nWell-Being, and Personal Relationships”] As a result, they\ngenerally see the disadvantages of disability not only as externally\ncaused, but as less formidable than they appear to people who view\ndisability in largely biomedical terms. These differences are\nreflected in the conflicting assessments of life with disabilities\nfound in the bioethics and public policy literature on the one hand,\nand disability scholarship on the other (contrast Brock, 2005 with\nGoering, 2008). \nThe different models of disability also seem to favor different\nresponses to disability. The medical model appears to support the\ncorrection of the biological condition or some form of compensation\nwhen that is impractical; the minority group model appears to favor\nmeasures to eliminate or compensate for exclusionary practices and\nrecognize their injustice; the human variation model appears to favor\nreconstruction of the physical and social environment to take into\naccount a wider range of differences in human structure and function.\nImportantly, such reconstruction may also be supported by the minority\ngroup model as an antidiscrimination measure, since that model views\nexclusionary environments and practices as the characteristic form of\ndiscrimination against people with disabilities. The human variation\nmodel may just make explicit the appropriate social response to\ndisability in a society without exclusion or discrimination. \nBut claims about the causes of disadvantage do not always yield\nstraightforward prescriptions for their remediation (Wasserman, 2001;\nSamaha, 2007). In some cases, medical or surgical\n“correction” may be the most effective way to escape\ndiscrimination; if correction is not appropriate, that is because it\nreinforces discriminatory attitudes and practices. The proper response\nto the disadvantages associated with disability depends not only on\ncausal attributions but also on moral judgments about responsibility,\nrespect, justice. The debates over cleft lip surgery and breast\nreconstruction after mastectomy are not only about the comparative\nimportance of biological and social factors in making the treated\nconditions disadvantageous. They also concern whether those\ninterventions are justifiable uses of scarce medical resources, and\nwhether they are complicit with suspect norms (Little, 1998), as in\nthe case of skin-lighteners for people of color (Asch, 2006). \nAlthough it is subject to dispute and qualification, the distinction\nbetween biological impairment and social limitation is relevant to\nmany normative and policy issues, especially those concerning the\nchoice between measures that modify the disabled individual or alter\nhis environment. In this section, we consider the role of that\ndistinction in addressing the critical question of how the experiences\nof people with disabilities are relevant to those issues. The\ndisability rights movement has long complained that the perspectives\nof people with disabilities are too often ignored or discounted. The\nslogan that served as the title for James Charlton's 1998 book,\nNothing About Us Without Us (Charlton, 1998; Stone, 1997) has\noften been invoked to demand the inclusion of people with disabilities\nin policy making and research concerning disability. The slogan\nsuggests that they have both a unique perspective to bring to those\nactivities and a right to take part in them. But what is the\n“us” to whom the slogan refers? Do persons with different\ndisabling traits have enough in common to claim that there is a\n“disability perspective” to bring to bear on policy and\nresearch? \nSuch questions are best approached in terms of the two aspects of\nimpairments recognized by most disability theorists: as structural or\nfunctional atypicalities, and as markers for discrimination. These two\naspects of impairment roughly correspond with two distinct types of\ndisability experience: \nThere may be more commonalities in one kind of experience than the\nother, and greater relevance to specific research or policy issues.\nFurther, the epistemic and moral authority of statements made by\npeople with disabilities about their experiences may vary with the\nkind of experience they describe. \nThe first type of experience involves the particularities of living\nwith atypical embodiment or functioning. Questions about this kind of\nexperience are often framed as what-is-it like questions: “What\nis it like to” have moderate or profound deafness? use a\nwheelchair to move? be legally or totally blind? be unable to hold or\nmanipulate objects with one's hands? have atypical speech? have a\nlearning disability or a mood disorder? Such questions are sometimes\nrequests for factual information about how one manages tasks with\none's disability—“how do you do x if you are in a\nwheelchair?” In other cases, they are requests for self-reports\nabout the phenomenological experience of being in a particular\nstate—“what does it feel like to get around in a\n wheelchair?”[2] \nPeople accustomed to their impairments may have little to report about\n“what it feels like” to have them, in part because absence\nof a function or a sense may not be something they experience as such,\nand because their atypical ways of functioning or sensing may not, in\nthemselves, be affect-laden—it is what they do\nunself-consciously, until it is called to their attention. The\nexperience of atypical functioning or sensing may be far more salient\nfor someone getting to know a person with a disability than it is to\nthe person herself. It may also be highly salient to a person who is\nrecently impaired, trying to function without limbs or senses that she\nused to have. But the experience of loss and frustration becomes less\nsalient with time, peer and professional support, as she gets more\nimmersed in going about day-to-day\n life.[3] \nEven when people with disabilities do report about what “it is\nlike” to have their impairments, those reports may vary\nconsiderably. The most obvious reason is that there is tremendous\nvariation in the sensory, physical and functional states of which\n“impaired” or “disabled” people are capable. A\nperson who can see but not hear has very different sensory experiences\nfrom a person who can hear but not see, who in turn has very different\nexperiences from a person who can see and hear but cannot move his\nlegs. This point should be obvious, but it is worth stressing, because\nit underscores the fact that the labels “disabled” and\n“impaired” do not track a distinct phenomenological\nexperience. \nMoreover, even two people with the same impairment label might give\ndifferent reports of how they do things or how they feel as they go\nabout life with their impairment This could be due partly to\ndifferences in the character or extent of their impairment—not\nall people labeled “deaf” are deaf to the same extent.\nFurther, their experience of life with an impairment may vary with the\nkinds of activity they engage in, and how they regard their\nimpairments as affecting their opportunities for self-fulfillment.\nOpportunities in turn may be influenced by all the factors, unrelated\nto impairment, that affect everyone: the family and neighborhood in\nwhich one grows up or now lives; one's disposition or personality; the\nfinancial resources at one's disposal; or one's education, religion,\nsex, or race. Moreover, people's experience of living with an atypical\nfunction sometimes may be difficult to distinguish from their\nexperience of stigma and discrimination. \nDespite these differences, the experiences of living with diverse\nimpairments have one thing in common—they are likely to be\nignored, or given insufficient weight, in the design of the physical\nand social environment. Unlike new acquaintances, planners and policy\nmakers may pay little attention to “what it is like” to\nget around with atypical functions. In constructing buildings, transit\nsystems, and work schedules, they often fail to listen carefully to\nwhat people with various impairments say about their experiences of\ndaily living. Those experiences cannot be adequately simulated by\nspending a day in a wheelchair or walking around with a\nblindfold—indeed, the confusion and disorientation that\nnondisabled people experience in simulating impairments is a very\nmisleading guide to the way people with disabilities experience and\nnegotiate the activities of daily living. Moreover, in learning about\nthe experiences of living with atypical functions, planners and policy\nmakers cannot take any single impairment as representative. The\nexperiences of people with different impairments differ as much from\neach other as they do from the experiences of nondisabled people. As\nthe human variation model emphasizes, the very diversity of\nimpairments poses an important challenge for an inclusive society. \nIf “baby boomers” who have not learned electronic\ncommunication become a despised, as opposed to merely statistical,\nminority, and if, as a result, they become cut off from friends and\nacquaintances who rely on email and social media for long-distance\ncommunication, and who dismiss them as luddites and fogeys, they will\nlearn something about the social construction of disability. They will\nlearn even more if they cannot cross the “digital divide”\nor can do so only at considerable economic cost or cognitive strain,\nor if they are still regarded as luddites and fogeys even when they\ndo. They will experience something of the stigma and discrimination\nthat cut across impairments. \nThe second type of disability experience, then, is of attitudinal\nbarriers to ordinary activity that are facts of life for people with\ndisabilities. According to the social model, which highlights these\nbarriers, the “disability experience” that links people\nwith cystic fibrosis to people with epilepsy, learning disabilities,\nor cerebral palsy is one of having to deal daily with the largely\nnegative responses of others. These negative responses involve several\nelements. The most discussed is overt stigmatization and\ndiscrimination: being treated as a social outcast, losing out on jobs,\nfriends, or partners, because other people do not want to interact\nwith a person with a disability, or enduring grossly inadequate\naccommodation because reasonable accommodation is thought too costly\nor troublesome. \nBut there are also less overt ways that society makes living with a\ndisability difficult. Simply being different from the majority of the\npopulation, in a way that the majority makes salient, can make people\nwith disabilities feel isolated or alienated. This experience is\nsimilar to those not only of other stigmatized minorities, such as\nAfrican-Americans or LGBTs, but of people with atypical\ncharacteristics who may not form a distinct political or cultural\nminority but are nonetheless constantly reminded of their difference.\nFor example, people whose spouses have died and older adults who are\nsingle for whatever reason may feel excluded from social events\nintended for couples, or face the presumption that they have a\n(usually opposite-sex) partner (“And what does your husband\ndo?”). \nIt is in the social construction of disability that we move from the\nparticularity of any one disability toward the common social\nexperiences of people with disabilities. Stigma, discrimination, and\nimputations of difference and inferiority are all parts of the social\nexperience of disability. Being greeted at a party or a conference not\nby “hello” but by “do you need any help?” and\nhaving virtually every aspect of one's interests, tastes, and\npersonality attributed to one's disability are also parts of the\ndisability experience. As one writer describes it, if he cooks it is\nbecause he doesn't want to be seen in public; if he eats in\nrestaurants it is because he can't cook (Brickner, 1976). Disability\nbecomes a “master status,” preventing people from playing\nany adult social role and eclipsing sex, race, age, occupation, or\nfamily (Goffman, 1963; Gliedman and Roth, 1980). Many nondisabled\npeople assume that people with disabilities won't make good partners\nand cannot or should not become parents (Safilios-Rothschild, 1970;\nShakespeare, 1996; Asch and Fine, 1988; Wates, 1997). People with\ndisabilities are perceived to be globally helpless based on their need\nfor assistance with some facets of daily life (Wright, 1983), fueling\nthe conviction that they are unable to render the help needed for\nsuccessful partnership or parenting. Most nondisabled people, after\nall, are not told that they are inspirations simply for giving the\ncorrect change at the drugstore. Perhaps there would not even be a\n“disability experience” in a world without the daily\nindignities, barriers, and prejudices that characterize life with\ndisability almost anywhere. \nJust as there is great variation in how members of racial and sexual\nminorities experience stigmatization, however, disabled people's\nexperience also varies. In claiming that the experience of stigma\nunites disabled people, we must be careful to acknowledge those\ndifferences. For example, a major source of variation is whether the\ndisability is visible or invisible (Davis, 2005; Banks and Kaschak,\n2003). Whereas visibly disabled people must deal with being instantly\nclassified as “different” and inferior, people with\ninvisible disabilities are often placed in the stressful and\nexhausting position of having to convince others that they are\n“really” disabled and not asking for special treatment.\nThe alternative is to keep quiet and forgo needed assistance, which\ncarries other costs, such as the stress of keeping a secret or trying\nto decide if a particular disclosure is safe (Schneider and Conrad,\n1985; Davis, 2005). \nIn addition, disabled people who are also members of other stigmatized\ngroups may experience a distinct kind of stigmatization that is\n“more than the sum of its parts.” For example, disabled\nwomen are disproportionately affected by society's obsession with body\nimage: they must confront not only sexism and prejudice against\ndisabled people, but a particularly virulent combination of the two\nthat stigmatizes women who do not fulfill a narrow ideal of feminine\nbeauty (Crawford and Ostrove, 2003) or are thought incapable of\nperforming the stereotypically female role of nurturer (Asch and Fine,\n1988). In a similar way, both African-Americans and disabled people\nare frequently stereotyped as dependent or ineffectual. And so\nAfrican-Americans who are also disabled face a particularly high\nburden in overcoming these stereotypes. \nMoreover, some would argue that to the extent that people with\ndisabilities have distinct and common experiences, they are due to\nembodiment as well as stigmatization. A disputed but much-discussed\nstrand of feminist philosophy holds that the experience of being\nfemale differs in important ways from being male, regardless of\ncultural position, discrimination, or political and economic power. On\nthis view, women differ in some important ways from men because of the\nbiology of femaleness and of childbearing, and those differences\nshould be seen as gateways into philosophical and moral understanding\n(Whitbeck, 1972). Discussions of “race” are similarly\ncomplex: is the experience of “race” entirely socially\nconstructed, or is there a biological component after all? (See\ngenerally APA Newsletter on the Black Experience, 2000).\nDebates about the experience of disability can be enriched by\nunderstanding these debates about other minority groups, even if\ndisability differs in significant respects. On the one hand, the\nbiological reality of many significant impairments affects the\nexperience of those with the impairments. On the other hand, different\nimpairments shape experience in very different ways. Clearly,\n“the experience of disability” is complex, and usefully\ncompared to the experience of other stigmatized minorities. \nThe first-hand experience of stigmatization may confer two sorts of\nauthority on people with disabilities. The first is epistemic. There\nshould be “nothing about us without us” because any\ndiscussion of, or research into, disability not informed by that\nexperience would likely be inaccurate and misguided. For example,\ndiscussions of well-being that do not take into account the\nperspective of disabled people may assume that their level of\nhappiness or satisfaction is much lower than it in fact is, or that it\nis lower mainly because of difficulties directly attributable to\nimpairments rather than to attitudes and social barriers. This is but\none application of the more general issue of first-person authority:\nthe extent to which people have special or privileged knowledge of\ntheir own mental states and experiences [see SEP entry on\n“Self-Knowledge”]. Although this is a subject of great\ncontroversy in the philosophy of mind, there is widespread agreement\nthat, at minimum, first-person ascriptions of mental states carry a\ndefeasible presumption of correctness. \nBut there is an additional epistemic reason for according significant\nweight to the first-hand reports of people with disabilities. The\nobservations and judgments of all stigmatized minorities are\nfrequently discounted, but people with disabilities face a distinct\nhandicap. There is a powerful, pervasive tendency among philosophers,\nsocial scientists, and laypeople to dismiss their self-appraisals as\nreflecting ignorance, self-deception, defensive exaggeration, or\ncourageous optimism [see SEP entry on “Feminist Perspectives on\nDisability”, Sec. 3]. Giving those self-appraisals heightened\nattention and deference may be an appropriate and effective way to\ncounteract or correct for that tendency. \nEpistemic authority thus provides a good reason for encouraging\ndisabled people to speak about their experiences and for nondisabled\npeople to listen when they do. But there is another reason as well:\npeople who suffer stigmatization, disrespect, and discrimination have\na moral claim to be heard that is independent of the accuracy of their\ntestimony. Even if someone lacking those experiences could convey them\naccurately and vividly, she would not be an adequate substitute for\nthose who had the experiences. The experience of stigmatization, like\nthe experience of other forms of oppression, calls for recognition,\nand thereby may impose a duty on those fortunate enough to have\navoided such experiences to listen closely to those who have had them.\nTo settle for second-hand accounts of those experiences or to ignore\nthem altogether seems disrespectful to the victims. The conviction\nthat the oppressed have a right to a hearing lies behind the recent\nproliferation of Truth Commissions and tribunals. It also helps\nexplain the frustration of crime and torture victims denied an\nopportunity to tell their stories, even when their oppressors receive\npunishment without their testimony. Though few disability advocates\nwould demand a tribunal for the routine indignities of life with\ndisabilities in developed countries, most demand a far greater voice\nin the media depiction of people with disabilities, in research about\nthem, and in policies concerning or affecting them. \nAt the same time, there are several dangers associated with placing\ntoo much emphasis on the moral privilege of victims of stigmatization.\nFirst, there is the danger of defining people by their oppression. The\nvictims may not want to be spokespeople or witnesses, or not for very\nlong; they may want to move on. It is important to recognize both the\nmoral authority of victims to testify and their prerogative to decline\nthat role. \nSecond, emphasizing the moral privilege of the stigmatized may obscure\ndifferences in the experience of stigmatization, and in the sort of\nauthority it confers. As we have seen, there is tremendous variation\nin the ways that disabled people experience stigma, although certain\nbroad generalizations may hold. \nThird, in conferring privilege on those who experience particular\nforms of oppression, we may obscure or slight the shared vulnerability\nof all human beings. For example, Ruth Anna Putnam champions social\nimprovements for women and other disadvantaged people but is wary of a\nparticularist feminist theory of justice, which may fail to emphasize\ncommonality of human experience and human need (Putnam, 1995). Might a\nsimilar wariness be warranted for disability? If, as Scotch and\nSchriner (1997) point out, we had a philosophy and public policy based\non common human needs, we might be able to get rid of “special\nneeds” and focus on multiple methods of meeting common ones,\nwith no negative shadow cast on any of those varied methods. \nFurther, when only the marginalized are asked to share their\n“experiences,” the experiences of the dominant group are\nleft unarticulated, unexamined, and unexplored. Once we argue that\npeople with disabilities need to be heard in bioethics and policy\ndebates as they describe the values and difficulties in their lives,\nwe should also be arguing for experiential accounts of the dominant\ngroup. When dominants examine their own experiences, they might see\nsimilarities to as well as differences from those who have been\nmarginalized. Both groups might benefit as a result. \nThe final danger in emphasizing the experience of stigmatization is\nthat it will exclude the voices of many people classified as having\ndisabilities but who do not see themselves as disabled or stigmatized.\nPeople with disabilities include millions who do not tend to speak in\nsocial model terms and who may not typically speak to their social, as\nopposed to their medical situation (although they do file\ndiscrimination complaints under the ADA when they think it\nappropriate). People who have back problems, cancer histories,\nParkinson's disease, Type II diabetes, stroke, emphysema, forms of\ndementia, mood disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse, or HIV do not\ntypically count themselves as part of the “disability\ncommunity.” The case for including such people is based in part\non the shared experience of socially-mediated exclusion. For example,\na person who has difficulty breathing because of emphysema and cannot\nvisit friends because she cannot walk to a distant bus stop is\ndisadvantaged by social organization in an analogous way to the person\nwith paraplegia who can't meet friends in inaccessible\nrestaurants. \nSuch inclusiveness, however, requires an acceptance of diverse\nattitudes and opinions. Even if the majority of people we would\nclassify as having disabilities perceived societal mistreatment and\ninstitutional barriers to be more oppressive than their diagnoses, not\nall of them would share that view or agree on the best response.\nAfrican-Americans have different views about affirmative action, and\nmany women do not believe that the option of legal abortion is\nessential for women's full participation in society. Disability\ntheorists can find it frustrating that most nondisabled people in\nbioethics dispute their claims about their experience, but those\ntheorists must respond to whatever challenge to the social model is\nposed by people with disabilities who see their condition, and not\nsociety, as the major impediment to their living rewarding lives. Many\npeople with both congenital and acquired disabilities have said that\nthey don't want cures but do want societal change, but that hardly\nwarrants the charge that Christopher Reeve wasn't speaking from his\nexperience of disability when he argued that what he wanted was\n“cure” and not social change (Johnson, 2003; Shakespeare,\n2006). \nLet us grant that a large number of people with particular impairments\nwill say at least some similar things about life with those\nimpairments, especially concerning stigma and discrimination. We are\nstill left with complex questions about what uses to make of such\nexperience in shaping public policy. \nClearly, one critical role is educational. Forty years ago plenty of\nwell-meaning men wondered why women objected to having doors held for\nthem, or to the exclusive use of male pronouns to refer to humans\ngenerally. Language, social conventions, and many aspects of life have\nchanged because men listened to women's accounts of how seemingly\ninnocuous acts felt, and of why those acts held not-so-innocuous\nimplications for their self-realization and social participation.\n“Why is that person on crutches so offended when I ask him if\nhe's traveling alone?” says the flight attendant who doesn't ask\nthe same question of his nondisabled seatmate. Why doesn't the man who\nis blind let it go when a cab driver won't take his money? A\nnondisabled person may think it would be great not to pay the\noutrageous fare as the meter climbs in New York City traffic. \nThe educational value in explaining the daily experience of stigma\ngoes far beyond “sensitivity training.” In making\nnondisabled people aware of how much of “the burden of\ndisability” arises from routine, seemingly innocuous social\ninteractions, people with disabilities can help to convince them that\nthe direct or internal effects of their various impairments are not\nnearly as bad as imagined. \nTaking the experiences of disabled people seriously may also have\nimportant implications for health policy. As is apparent in many\nbioethical and policy discussions, most nondisabled people, including\nhealth professionals, imagine the experience of disability to be far\nworse than reported by the disabled themselves (Basnett, 2001 and\nGill, 2000). This gap is not explainable solely by the limited contact\nbetween the two groups. In developing a plan for Medicaid rationing in\nOregon in the early 1990s, nondisabled people ranked treatments to\nsustain the lives of people with quadriplegia as of very low priority\nbecause of their presumed low quality of life (Menzel, 1992); people\nwith quadriplegia complained that they had been left out of the\nsurveys and that their appreciation of their lives had not informed\nthe ranking process. Such serious policy errors might\nhave been avoided by a recognition that people with disabilities had\nthe same epistemic authority as nondisabled people to assess the\nquality of their lives. \nThe varied experiences of functioning with an impairment may have a\nmore modest role to play in policy deliberations than the common\nexperiences of stigma and discrimination. But that role is still an\nimportant one. In designing buildings, transit systems, and other\npublic and private facilities, and in establishing norms of conduct in\nschools and workplaces, we need to know a lot about how people with\natypical functions get around and get along. It is not enough to\nensure that the width of a doorway exceeds the width of a standard\nwheelchair; it is also important to find out about the preferences of\nwheelchair mobilizers before and after they enter a building. This\nkind of information is no different from that routinely elicited from\nnondisabled people in designing facilities. But it requires the\nrepresentation of people with a wide array of impairments, and it\nrequires respectful attention to the minutiae of their daily\nlives.","contact.mail":"daniel.m.putnam@dartmouth.edu","contact.domain":"dartmouth.edu"}]
