As a Master of Arts he is one of the\nfirst to comment on the newly available Aristotelian logical works,\ncommentaries whose influence is generally recognized. His is also a\nwidely read introduction to the sciences, the De ortu\nscientiarum. He is however mostly associated with Augustinian\nthought, especially on the plurality of substantial forms and the\nactive nature of perception, and through his involvement in the\ncontroversy surrounding the Prohibitions in 1277 of thirty articles on\nlogic, grammar, and natural philosophy. He was promoted to Cardinal\nand died soon after arriving at the Papal Court of Viterbo, in\n1279.\n\nRobert Kilwardby was an Englishman born either in Leicestershire or in\nYorkshire, probably, in 1215. He started his university studies in\nParis around 1231, becoming a Master of Arts around 1237. He taught\nthere until 1245, when he moved back to England, at which time he\nentered into the Dominican Order. This marked the beginning of a\nrather successful ecclesiastic career. He taught theology at Oxford\nfrom approximately 1254 until 1261, when he was elected Prior\nProvincial of the English Dominicans. In 1269 he participated in the\nDominican General Chapter in Paris where he, together with Thomas\nAquinas (and other members), was responsible for analyzing the process\nof Bartholomew of Tours (MOPH I, 155). During this period he was also\ninvolved in a polemic about the nature of poverty with the\nFranciscans, in particular John Pecham (who later would accuse\nKilwardby of stealing documents—the register and the records of\nthe See and objects from the See of Canterbury), which has remained in\nthe form of letters. Kilwardby was nominated Archbishop of Canterbury\nin 1272. Two of his acts as Archbishop were the coronation of Edward\nI, at Westminster Abbey, on the 19th of August 1274 and the issuing of\nthe Prohibitions of Oxford on the 18th of March 1277 (see Silva\n2012). \nKilwardby's participation in this last event is at the same time the\nsource of his fame and disgrace. The episode itself consisted in the\nissuing of a list of 30 denounced articles focusing on the subjects of\ngrammar (4), logic (10), and natural philosophy (16). There are two\nformal points which should not be overlooked: first, the prohibitory\nrather than condemnatory nature of the list—Kilwardby was\nexplicit that these articles were to be prohibited for being primarily\nphilosophical mistakes and only secondarily against Christian dogma.\nOne found guilty of defending and disseminating these mistakes was, if\na Master, to be removed from his teaching position, and if not yet a\nMaster, never to become one and to be expelled from the university.\nSecond, this list was not the result of the Archbishop's visit to the\nUniversity of Oxford and a subsequent ill-will towards it, but rather\nit had been agreed upon by all the regent and non-regent Masters of\nthe University. \nAlthough close in time to the Condemnations of Paris, no proof of\nconnection between them has been presented, nor does it seem that\nKilwardby was acting under Papal orders. The direct targets of these\npropositions are still to be identified. Nevertheless, already in\nKilwardby's time, some of the propositions in naturalibus\nwere interpreted as aimed at the teaching of Thomas Aquinas, namely\nthose propositions related to his doctrine of the unicity of\nsubstantial form. The first reaction came in a letter written by Peter\nof Conflans, a disciple of Aquinas. Kilwardby's answer constitutes the\nclearest expression of his theory of the plurality of substantial\nforms in human beings. A more institutional reaction took place when\nthe General Chapter of the Order, to which both Aquinas and Kilwardby\nbelonged, met in Milan (1278) and decided to send a commission in\norder to investigate and punish those who blackened the writings of\nThomas Aquinas scandalizing the order (in scandalum ordinis).\nThe results of this commission are unknown. The next Chapter, held in\nParis, repeated the recommendation and urged the praise of Thomas'\nworks. Meanwhile, Pope Nicholas III appointed Kilwardby to the post of\nCardinal of Porto and S. Rufina in 1278, which allowed him to move\nfrom England to Italy. This nomination can be understood either as an\nattempt to protect Kilwardby from his own Order or as a way of\nstopping Kilwardby's actions against Thomas and Thomism. The Oxford\nProhibitions were later interpreted as a campaign against Thomism\n(Callus 1955), but this interpretation has been challenged (Wilshire\n1964). A conciliatory approach could be that in the Prohibitions\nKilwardby was criticizing a presumed interpretation of Aristotle that\nmade Aristotle's doctrine incompatible with his own reading of\nAugustine. Kilwardby died in 1279, soon after his arrival at the Papal\ncourt in Viterbo, where he lies buried. (For more bibliographical\ndetails, see Sommer-Seckendorff, 1937; see also Silva 2011.) \nTwo final remarks about Kilwardby's life and thought. First, although\nhe came to be known as a polemicist, the leitmotif of his work was to\nharmonize/reconcile Aristotle and Augustine—a certain\nunderstanding of Aristotle with a certain understanding of Augustine,\nthat is. Second, his life's work seems to move against the mainstream\nof the century he lived in. Most authors had adopted the new\nAristotelian philosophy that new translations of known works and\nespecially recently discovered ones (to the Latin West, that is) just\nmade available. Many an author, challenged by these texts, changed\ntheir philosophical alliances from traditional Augustinian thought to\na more modern and progressive Aristotelianism, “spiced up”\nby its Arabic commentators. Kilwardby, however, started his career by\nbeing a faithful Aristotelian, as his commentaries (mostly on logic)\non the works of the Greek philosopher testify. It is only after he had\nbeen for some time a Master of Arts at the University of Paris that\nhis philosophical views changed to become more and more influenced by\nAugustine. If one were to define Kilwardby's philosophical\ncommitments, it would be more correct to say that he was originally an\nAristotelian and converted to Augustinianism without ever ceasing to\nbe an interpreter of Aristotle. Once we keep in mind that he remained\nan Aristotelian throughout his career—of an eclectic type, it\nmust be said—his thought becomes easier to understand because we\nare not drawing him against a background that doesn't fit—he is\noften labeled anti-Aristotelian. \nA complete list of works by Kilwardby includes texts on logic,\ngrammar, theology, and natural philosophy. These texts vary greatly in\nterms of the influence they exerted on later thought, with the logical\ncommentaries occupying a place of relevance. Kilwardby's works are\nspread over three main periods: the Parisian period between 1237 and\n1245; the middle period, around 1245–1250; and the Oxonian\nperiod from 1250 to 1279. \nIn the Parisian period Kilwardby wrote mainly logical commentaries,\namong which should be counted those included in the Course on the\nLogica Vetus (Lewry 1978): on the Isagoge,\nPraedicamenta, Perihermeneias, Liber Sex\nPrincipiorum, and Liber divisionum Boethii. The edition\nof the whole course was started by the late Patrick Osmund Lewry and\nis currently being completed by Alessandro Conti (University of\nL'Aquila,\n Italy).[1]\n The commentary on the Isagoge has been the object of a\ncomparative study by David Piché (2002), and the commentary on\nthe Categories is available on-line in a provisory edition by\nAlessandro Conti. Kilwardby also wrote commentaries on Aristotle's\nPrior and Posterior Analytics (the latter published\nas Giles of Rome), as well as the commentaries In librum\ntopycorum (partialy edited by Weijers, 1995), De Sophistici\nElenchi, In Priscianus Minor, and Notulae libri\nPrisciani De accentibus (ed. Lewry, 1988). The commentary on the\nPrior Analytics is being edited by Paul Thom (University of\nSidney)—having received careful examination in Thom\n2007—and the Commentary on the Posterior Analytics has\nreceived a provisory critical edition in an unpublished PhD\ndissertation by Debora Cannone (2003–2004). The commentary on\nthe Priscianus Minor remains unedited, but has been examined\nby Irène Rosier (1994), who transcribes the most relevant\npassages. Kilwardby is probably the author of a Commentary on the\nOld and New Ethics; the edition of this commentary was started by\nLewry and is under completion by Anthony Celano (Stonehill\n College).[2] \nFrom the same period, and previously thought to be Kilwardby's but now\ngenerally regarded as unauthentic, are the In Priscianus\nMaior and the Sophismata grammaticalia. Also the\nauthorship of In Donati artem maiorem III (ed.\nSchmücker, 1984) and Sophismata logicalia is now highly\n disputable.[3]\n The commentaries on the Physics and on the\nMetaphysics that were identified by Gàl (1953) are now\nsecurely attributed to Geoffrey of Aspall (Macrae 1968). \nIn the period around 1245–1250, when he was moving from Paris to\nOxford, Kilwardby wrote the encyclopaedic treatise De ortu\nscientiarum (ed. Judy, 1976), a treatise on the nature of time\n(De tempore), and a work on perception entitled De\nspiritu fantastico (both works were edited by Lewry, 1987). \nDuring the Oxford period (after 1250) Kilwardby wrote an array of\ndisparate works: De natura relationis, Quaestiones in\nquattuor libros Sententiarum, De 43 questionibus, and\nEpistola ad Petrum de Confleto. All these works have been\nedited, even if not all in a critical edition. From the same period\nare also some minor theological works such as De confessione,\nDe necessitate Incarnationis, De conscientia et de\nsynderesi, the Tabulae super originalia patrum, the\nArbor consanguinitatis et affinitatis, and some\nsermons—the Sermo in capite ieiunii and the Sermo\nin dominica in Passione. The two sermons have been edited, as\nwell as the work on the necessity of Incarnation. Worth mentioning is\na letter expressing some criticism over Franciscan poverty\n(Epistola ad novitios de excellentia Ordine Praedicatorum),\nwhich survives in John Pecham's answer (Tractatus contra fratrem\nRobertum Kilwardby), edited in Pecham's Tractatus tres de\npaupertate. \nEarly lists of works, such as the Stams Catalogue, attribute\nto Kilwardby the De unitate formarum, De physica,\nand De metaphysica, whereas Nicholas Trivet mentions the\ntreatise De universali. This latter work is possibly a\nreference to a passage in Kilwardby's Notule Libri\nPosteriorum—“Hec est pars in qua Aristotiles\ndeterminat de uniuersali” (Cannone 2002, 132)—which might\nhave circulated isolated from the rest of the work. In the same way,\nthe work De unitate formarum clearly is the last (7th)\narticle of Kilwardby's answer to a letter sent to him by Peter of\nConflans, and it is found alone in some manuscripts. \nThe editing of Kilwardby's works is inconsistent. On the one hand, the\ntexts from the middle and later periods are almost all edited; on the\nother, the texts of the early period, his comments on logical,\nethical, and grammatical works, remain for the most part in manuscript\nform only. This last is surprising especially since these are the\nworks that traditionally scholars have identified as holding a more\nlasting influence. The attention that has been devoted to Kilwardby's\nthought in the last two decades might prefigure a change in this state\nof affairs. The collected volume edited by Lagerlund and Thom (2013)\nis an expression of this increased interest. Recent work by\nMora-Márquez, Thom, Hansen, Conti, and Thörnqvist to name\njust a few (see Bibliography), has focused on logical aspects of\nKilwardby's thought in relation to some of his philosophical\ninterlocutors, such as John Pagus, Nicholas of Paris, and Albert the\nGreat. In this article I will focus on a cursory presentation of\nKilwardby's main philosophical doctrines. A fuller account of these,\nwith exception to 5.2.4, 6, and 7, can be found in Silva 2007, 2008,\n2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013.  \nA human being is a composite of two substances, the body and the soul\n(DOS 316). The soul is the act and form of the whole (totius)\nhuman body (NLPor 8, P 38vb), and it is present wholly in every part\nof the body (in qualibet parte corporis tota). To be present\nwholly in every part does not require simplicity, as absence of\ncomposition, but spirituality (that is, immateriality) (E 6,\n47–48). \nAccording to Kilwardby, the human soul is a composite of three forms:\nvegetative, sensitive, and intellective. The vegetative and sensitive\nare qualified as the principles of life because through them the being\nperforms the operations of life. Like most of his contemporaries,\nKilwardby claims a double origin for the parts of the human soul: the\nvegetative and sensitive result from natural generation, that is, they\nare educed from the active potentiality of matter, whereas the\nintellective soul is created directly by God. It is created as the\nperfection of the human body and as a hoc aliquid (E 5; QLIIS\n138, 370), that is, an individual in the genus of substance. The\nintellective soul is a spiritual substance, a hoc aliquid,\ncreated as to exist quasi personaliter. The soul is not a\nperson because, even though it is a complete substance of the rational\nkind and exists in act, it is part of another thing—a human\nbeing (QLIII1S 8, 36). A human being is constituted by the rational\nsoul and the body (E 7, 51). The soul constitutes a person only when\nunited with the body in an actual existing human being (QLIII1S 10,\n52). \nThis difference in genesis explains the different nature of the\nintellective soul with respect to the other souls: whereas the\nvegetative and the sensitive souls are defined as forms or acts of the\nbody, the intellective soul is the act of the sensitive body in the\nsense of being its perfection: it is the completion of the process of\ndevelopment; it is the actuality of no part of the body and does not\nrequire bodily organs for its operations (DOS 56). The relation of the\nintellective form to the body is that of the sailor to the ship\n(sicut nauta navi), but this union is accidental only from\nthe point of view of its operations—such as in understanding,\nwhere the intellective soul does not need bodily organs—but not\nfrom the point of view of the essence of the intellective soul (DOS\n53). \nAn essential feature of the intellective soul is its natural desire\nand inclination (appetitus et inclinatio naturalis) to be\nunited to a body capable of sensation (as it “hates” being\nseparated from it; DOS 358). The intellective soul can exist without\nthe body, but it is not created to exist without it, as it has, on the\ncontrary, a natural inclination to be united with it. It is this\n‘unibility’ that differentiates it from the angelic\nintellective soul (in the same way as the human body is differentiated\nfrom the bodies of other animals; QLIIS 7, 26). In Kilwardby's own\nwords, “the [human] soul is born to move and to perfect the\nbody, and in this way it differs from an angel” (see also QLIIS\n6; in this he follows Bonaventure). The intellective soul is the\nspecific (completive) difference in both, but it differs in species:\nwhereas the human intellective soul is created to be united with a\nbody, the angelic intellective soul is non-united with a body (QLIIS\n6, 23–24; 7, 26). This unibility (unibilitas) or\naptitude to be united with the body is not an accidental feature but\nsomething essential to the human intellective soul (QLIIS 7, 27). \nThe utmost justification for this unibility is the intellective soul's\nnatural capacity to know everything—an application of the\nAristotelian principle that human beings desire to know everything.\nThe rational soul is born (nata est) to know things in a\ntwofold manner. The intellect turns its attention both to the images\nof sensible things received through the senses and abstracted from the\nphantasms, but it can also turn itself to the eternal, superior\nreasons (DSF 25; QLIII2S 24, 84). Thus, because the intellective soul\nis the perfection of the sensitive body, it can only fulfill its\nperfection, that is, the knowledge of all things, by means of its\nunion with the body (QLIIS 8, 32). \nOnce infused by God, the intellective form connects the previous forms\ninherent in the body of the embryo (vegetative and sensitive) and\nconstitutes with them a human rational soul, “in much the same\nway as a quadrangle, which in fact contains two triangles would become\na pentagon, if a triangle were added to one of its sides” (D43Q\n34, 37; see also E 5, 42). The addition of the new triangle to the\nexisting quadrangle—composite of two triangles—does not\ncause the corruption of the existing figures, but rather complements\nthem. In the case of the soul, it means that the vegetative and\nsensitive potentiae continue to be responsible for their\noperations after the infusion of the completive intellective\npotentia.  \nKilwardby's theory of the soul is formulated around these central\nconceptions of unity and composition, rather than unicity and\nsimplicity. In his words, “all composite things have unity, even\nthough they do not have simplicity” (E 6, 47). His argument is\nthat complexity is not incompatible with unity, only with\nsimplicity—what is required in addition is only a principle\nstrong enough to justify the unity. A substance can be composite and\nnevertheless one when the essentially different parts are ordered to\neach other (ad invicem). A human being has “one form\nwhich is not simple (simplex) but a composite of many\n[potentiae] having a natural order to each other” (E 7,\n 53).[4] \nBefore continuing the examination of Kilwardby's theory of the human\nsoul, some terminological remarks are in order: Kilwardby uses the\nterm potentiae mostly to refer to the vegetative, sensitive,\nand intellective souls. There are some exceptions, where he uses\nformae and even formae substantiales, but the rule\nis potentiae. For the most part, I leave the term\n‘potentia’ un-translated because the options are\nproblematic: ‘power’ should be used to translate\n‘virtus’ in the sense of ‘faculty’ (for\nexample, memory is a power of the soul); ‘potency’ should\nbe avoided in order not to confuse it with potentiality, as in active\npotency; ‘soul’ is misleading because most (if not all)\npluralists claimed that there is only one soul in any individual human\nbeing—the disagreement between them and unitarians is about\nwhether there is one or many potentiae in a individual human\nsoul rather than whether there is one or many souls in a individual\nhuman being; ‘form’ is a too general term—however,\nfor simplification purposes I sometimes shall use it, namely in the\ncontext of the debate over unicity versus the plurality of substantial\nforms as that is the traditional designation of the debate. I\nthoroughly use the term ‘unicity’ to refer to the view\naccording to which the soul is simple, having only one form. Unity is\noften used in scholarship, but I find it problematic because\npluralists—such as Kilwardby—also argue for the unity of\nthe soul, as said above, only disagreeing about its simple (versus\ncomposite) nature. Finally, I use ‘intellective’ soul/form\n(potentia intellectiva) to refer to the specifically human\npart of the soul; the rational soul (anima rationalis) refers\nto the whole human soul—which includes the vegetative and\nsensitive forms. Kilwardby adopts this distinction for the most part,\nbut there are passages—especially in E 5 and QLIIS 8—where\nhe uses rational (rationalis) and intellective\n(intellectiva) interchangeably. \nOne of the most important passages in which Kilwardby carefully\ndiscusses the human soul is E 5. Here he presents what he takes to be\nthe three more important theories of the human soul, its substantial\nnature, and its potentiae. I focus on the first of these\ntheories, which is the one he most vehemently criticizes, and on the\nthird, which is his own. They can be displayed in the following\nway: \n(1) According to the first theory, the human rational soul is a\nsubstance that is simple in its essence, in other words it has no\nparts. It is the same essence that vegetates, senses, and understands.\nThe problem Kilwardby identifies in this theory is that the\nvegetative, sensitive and intellective potentiae are found in\ndifferent kinds of beings: the vegetative is found without the others\nin plants, the sensitive without the intellective in non-rational\nanimals, and the intellective without the other two in spiritual\nbeings. But, if that is the case, how do they come to be one and a\nsame simple essence in humans? The only way to sustain such a thesis\nwould be to argue that these potentiae are equivocally said\nof humans and other beings; but that is manifestly false: if the\nobjects and operations of the powers are the same, the powers and the\npotentiae in which they are rooted must also be the same. For\nexample, in both humans and other living things the operations of the\nvegetative part of the soul are to take nourishment, generate, and\ngrow. Therefore, the vegetative potentiae is the same in all\nliving things and the sensitive is the same in all animals (E 5,\n35–6). The problem is that if all three parts of the soul\nconstitute one and the same simple essence, then \nIf that were the case, they would have intellective souls without\nhaving appropriated bodies; so \nThat is, for Kilwardby, manifestly false. A further problem with this\nsimplicity of the essence concerns the coming into being of the soul.\nIf the three potentiae—vegetative, sensitive, and\nintellective—constitute a simple essence, then they must come\ninto being either \nKilwardby simply rejects (y) because it asserts the existence\nof a naturally generated intellective soul in plants and animals. \nIf (x′), then the souls of plants and animals are\ncreated out of nothing, which means they cannot be corrupted. \nIf (x″), then the human soul is ex traduce\n(hereditary), whence corruptible. \nBoth lead to absurd consequences and must therefore be dismissed.\nInstead, Kilwardby argues for the double origin of the\npotentiae of the soul, which implies that they must be\nessentially distinct. \n(2) According to this theory, the human soul is constituted by three\nsubstantial forms (tribus formis substancialibus) which\ndiffer essentially from one another; two (vegetative and sensitive)\nare the result of the work of nature (opus nature)—by\nmeans of the potencies of elements and the original principles with\nwhich the matter of transmutable things is naturally endowed—and\nthe intellective form is the result of divine creation. The three\nforms are present at the same time in the human embryo only after the\nintellective soul has been created and infused into the developing\nbeing, not before—and this is due to the need for an appropriate\nlevel of material organization that disposes the being to receive the\nintellective soul as its perfection (E 5, 44). \nThese forms make together one human soul, which is the form of the\nhuman body. Each of these forms can be considered either in respect to\nthe body they vivify and in this sense (as essential determinations)\nnone of them is the form of the others, or as constituting part of a\nsoul that is the animating principle of a certain kind of life, the\nhuman life, and in this sense the intellective part is the form and\ncomplement of all the others (QLIII2S 63, 268). In the actual\nconstitution of all natural things that comprise one natural whole,\nthere are several dispositions that prepare for and are perfected by\nthe last form, which completes the thing (QLIII2S 63, 269). The part\nthat completes the entity gets to denominate the whole soul (QLIII1S\n9, 46; see also Lewry LSP, 399). The intellective form is the\n‘completion of human life’ (D43Q 34), that is, that which\nmakes that particular life to be a specifically human life. This is\nthe theory Kilwardby takes to be in agreement with philosophical\nreason and Christian faith and the one to which he adheres. \nKilwardby is clear in showing that his criticism is not aimed at the\nconception of the soul as being the form of a living thing, but at the\nconception of the soul as a simple form. He advocates a view of the\nhuman being as composite of a plurality of essentially different\nforms. This view is not incompatible with their making one soul, which\nis the form of a living thing. In the same way as the body is a unity\neven though it is constituted by a plurality of parts—foot,\nhand, blood, bone—each having its own form—the human soul\nalso is constituted by a plurality of parts and nevertheless is a\nunity. The parts of the body make one body by aggregation. \nThe human rational soul is, according to both Aristotle and Augustine\n(as Kilwardby claims), a substance composed of three essentially\ndifferent parts—the vegetative, sensitive, and\nintellective—just as a definition having three differentiae is\ncomposed (E 5, 43). The unity of the soul is grounded in a hierarchy\nof forms, where some are incomplete and dispositional, while one is\ncompletive and perfective. \nEach of these three forms has powers through which it performs the\noperations that are proper to it. Powers are defined by their actions,\nwhich in turn are defined by their objects. The powers of the\nsoul—for example, memory or intellect—are active\npotentialities; once activated by an external agent they bring about\ntheir own actualities by way of their operations—for example,\nunderstanding in the case of the intellect. This conception also means\nthat a human being performs different operations via different forms:\na human being understands by means of the intellective form, not the\nsensitive or vegetative forms (E 5, 43). Essentially different\noperations are rooted in essentially different forms; for example,\nperceiving requires bodily organs and understanding does not (QLIIS 8,\n29; E 7, 51). \nThe soul is composite in substance and powers, and it is simple in\nexistence in that it is not divisible and exists wholly in every part\nof the body (tota in qualibet parte corporis). This\nsimplicity is the simplicity of power controlling the body (E 6,\n46–48). There is, however, one type of unity mentioned in the\nbeginning of this entry that needs to be addressed: the unity of being\nor substantial unity, the unity formed by the body and the soul, which\nis properly a human being. \nKilwardby subscribes to the principle according to which two actual\nthings cannot make one thing in actuality. But this principle, he\nclaims, does not apply to the body and soul because neither the\nintellective soul nor the sensitive body—that is, the body\ninformed by the sensitive form—are one complete being. The\nsensitive body is not perfect and needs to be completed by the\nintellective form, and the intellective form is created to be the\nperfection of the sensitive body (E 5, 41). \nKilwardby has such a desire to substantiate this unity that he finds\nhimself in an extremely difficult position when considering what\nhappens to the soul and the whole of its potentiae at the\ndeath of the body. He sees no particular problem in arguing for the\nimmortality of the intellective part of the soul, but he hesitates in\nwhat happens to the vegetative and sensitive forms in such a way that\nhe ends up giving two opposite accounts, one aligned with Aristotle,\nthe other with Augustine. On the one hand, according to the former,\nthe vegetative and sensitive forms, operating only through the body,\ncannot remain after death; as they were naturally generated, they were\ncreated by God to be re-united with the resurrected body and the\nimmortal intellective soul at the end of time. On the other hand,\naccording to Augustine, the bond which unites all the\npotentiae of the soul is so strong that it cannot be broken\nwith the separation from the body; the whole soul remains in the\ndisembodied state, and the soul is able in this state to perform acts\nof imagination—not by receiving images of sense objects from\nsense experience but from the power of memory. He indicates no clear\npreference for either account although the Augustinian would seem more\nin tune with his general theory of the soul. \nFinally, it is obvious from his account in E 5 that Kilwardby is\nopposing contemporary theories of the soul of the time. In his letter\nto Kilwardby, soon after the Prohibitions, Peter of Conflans inquires\nabout whether he is critical of the theory of the unity of forms\n(positio de unitate formarum) associated with the name of\nThomas Aquinas. In the only place Kilwardby explicitly addresses the\nso-called theory of the unity of forms he describes it as holding that\nthere is only one form that when it supervenes the existing composite\ncorrupts all the existing forms and it performs by itself all the\nactions. \nFirst, according to Kilwardby, such a theory claims that there is one\nlast form which is the perfection of the composite; second, that all\nthe other forms informing matter would be corrupted by this perfective\nform, hence, only one form would remain in the whole composite; third,\nthat one and the same form is responsible for all the operations the\nbeing performs. Kilwardby argues against this theory—which\nresembles but is not to be identified with any of the theories\npresented in E 5—with an array of objections, of which the most\nrelevant are: \nTo sum up Kilwardby's view, the position is incomprehensible and leads\nto major philosophical and theological difficulties; it should\ntherefore be avoided. \nIn a clear adoption of what is called universal hylemorphism,\nKilwardby claims that everything that subsists on its own, apart from\nGod, has two compositing principles, a quod est (matter) and\na quo est (form) (DOS 256; 265; 268; QLIS 35, 90; QLIS 60,\n171; QLIIS 14, 51–2). \nThree main issues arise from Kilwardby's treatment of matter: \nIn (i) the discussion about the unity of matter arises from the\nquestions of whether spiritual beings have matter and whether this\nmatter is in some way common to the matter of corporeal beings\n(univocally, i.e., whether it is matter in the same sense) (QLIIS\n14–16; DOS, chapters 29–31). According to its editor,\nAlbert Judy, DOS 31 is probably the result of a public disputation on\nthe topic by Kilwardby or one that he is reporting. The relation is\nclear between this chapter and the view of some of Kilwardby's\ncontemporaries, such as Roger Bacon, Albert the Great, and Bonaventure\n(see also Donati 2013). \nKilwardby starts by distinguishing two ways of considering prime\nmatter (materia omnino prima): \nAccording to the second view, there is a diversity of essence: matter\nis not one and the same in all things but diverse in different things.\nThis diversity of essence remains even when all the forms that\nconstitute any individual of one the kinds of being—spiritual,\ncorporeal, and natural—are (in thought) removed. According to\nthis theory, the essence of the prime matter, which constitutes any\nindividual, has different grades of purity. Prime matter has\nsubstantially different parts, sharing an essence that is one by\nanalogy. In the end, Kilwardby seems inclined (QLIIS 15) to align\nhimself with the view that the unity of matter is analogical, not\nnumerically one. \nIn E 2 Kilwardby approaches the question in slightly different terms,\nwhich can be explained by the fact that his motivation is different:\nwhereas in DOS and QLIIS he intends to justify the distinction between\ncorporeal and spiritual things, in E he wants to explain change. There\nare, he argues, three kinds of prime matter: \nAPM has no form whatsoever and underlies (substat) all forms\nit receives: first the general forms, then the special forms. Even\nthen, Kilwardby claims, matter is not nothing simpliciter,\nthat is, lacking being but rather nothing actual (sed non ideo\ndicitur simpliciter nihil, sed nihil actuale: QLIS 79, 254).\nNaked prime matter receives first the form of the most general genus,\nsubstance, and through this form prime matter is divided into\nnumerically distinct things (only form distinguishes; QLIIS 16, 60;\nDOS 208; 406). This is the matter common to spiritual and corporeal\nthings. \nThen, substance receives the form of corporeity, by means of which it\nbecomes a body with dimensions and magnitude (DOS 246)—that is,\nmatter gets extended and occupies space (DOS 340; NSLP 8, 55). This\nmatter is BPM and is common to both celestial and terrestrial bodies.\nRegarding BPM, it is necessary that there be one matter that is the\nsubstrate of substantial change (or circular motion in the case of\ncelestial bodies), and this matter is the corporeal substance, that\nis, substance plus the form of corporeity (DOS 244–245). When\nsomething looses a substantial form, it is not annihilated but remains\nat least with dimensions and the form of corporeity (E 1, 21), as when\na dead body is reduced to its state of being a mere aggregate of its\ncomponents indicating its composition (cimbolum sue\nmixcionis) (E 5, 40; DOS 244). Finally, matter receives the\nspecific differences of bodies and the passive and active qualities\n(DOS 248). This is PPM, the matter common to all simple and mixed\nbodies in the sublunary sphere, that is, those that are generable and\ncorruptible. \nMatter and form are the constitutive principles of a thing, but there\nare three principles of change: matter, form, and privation. Privation\nis something of its own kind or, in the negative, privation ‘is\nnot pure nothing’ or even pure absence of form but the state of\n‘actively’ lacking that something imperfect has with\nrespect to fulfillment (E 3, 31)—and only in this way can\nprivation be understood as a principle of change. Privation is the\nstate of a potentiality that does not have the perfection that is owed\nto it (E 3, 30). In that sense, privation is associated with active\n potency.[7] \nKilwardby argues that PPM is naturally endowed/pregnant\n(gravida) with active potencies that, once set in motion by\nthe action of an external agent, co-operate in change and become fully\n actual.[8]\n An active potency “is called potency because it is ordained to\nactuality and active because it is something of a form” (E 3,\n30). He calls them active potencies because matter strives for form\nand the action of striving entails the existence already of something\nof form. Matter must therefore be endowed with active potencies.\nPotentiality here is taken not as mere receptivity of form but as an\nactive appetite for form, that is, for (full) actuality. An active\npotency is a form in an incomplete state because it was born to make\nitself actual (nata est facere se in\n actu).[9] \nThe existence of matter endowed with forms in an inchoate state is\nnecessary, according to Kilwardby, in order to distinguish generation\nfrom creation as well as to assure that generation is a natural (and\nnot violent) change—since an active potency is an internal\nprinciple of motion. Another of the applications of the notion of\nactive potency is to explain elemental change. Every part of PPM that\nis informed by the form of a body has the forms of all four elements\nin potency. At any given time, only one of these forms can be actual.\nThe elements transmute into one another in virtue of their active and\npassive qualities (DOS 249). With this account, Kilwardby addresses\nthe question of the presence of the four elements' forms existing\nwithin mixed bodies differently from other authors of his time. He\ntakes his notion of potency, being a form in an inchoate state of\nactuality, as sufficient to avoid the problem of the simultaneous,\nfully actual presence of contraries in one and the same subject. \nThe third application of the notion of active potency is to explain\nhuman generation. Kilwardby appeals to a (then) well-known concept,\nespecially in the Augustinian milieu, of seminal reasons (see Karger\n2002; Donati 2002). Seminal reasons are a philosophical concept used\nby Augustine in order to explain two apparently incompatible accounts\nof creation: one according to which everything was created in an\ninstant, the other that there were successive moments of creation\n(described in the six days narrative of the Genesis).\nKilwardby interprets this concept as meaning that everything was\ncreated immediately but not everything was made immediately (QLIIS 61,\n174): in Creation, God created corporeal matter out of which He\nproduced the first light as well as the first individuals of the\ndifferent species (D43Q 1, 11; QLIIS 85, 240). When He created the\nfirst individuals, He inserted in them these seminal reasons (QLIIS\n63, 179; D43Q 15, 21; 26, 29; QLIIS 61, 176), which are the cause,\nthrough the generative power, of the generation of individuals and\ntherefore explain the propagation of species throughout time (E 4, 32;\nE 1, 22; 5, 39–40; D43Q 26, 31). \nIn the process of the generation of a human being, the father\ntransmits to the descendent matter—endowed with seminal reasons,\nwhich contribute to the preservation and continuity of the\nspecies—and the corporeal spirit. These are present in the\nsemen, as the first principle of life and the power of the principle\nof life. The principle of life is that which first receives the action\nof the soul, the one in which the soul is realized; the power of the\nprinciple of life is that which acting as an efficient cause brings\nthe active potency in matter to actuality. \nThe semen cannot be just a superfluity of digested food because,\nKilwardby argues, the offspring would resemble the father's aliment\nand not the father (E 4, 30). According to Kilwardby, the mother\ncontributes to the offspring with matter that is used to protect and\nfeed the embryo (some matter of the semen has the same purpose) and\nthe local warmth that constitutes the proper environment to the\ndevelopment of the new life. \nIn the same way as a plant germinates from a seed, the vegetative and\nsensitive souls (the principle of life) exist in an inchoate state in\nthe semen separated from the father, and they are educed from this\nmatter by the action of the corporeal spirit (the power of the\nprinciple of life—D43Q 34, 37; QLIIS 85, 239). \nAs for point (iii) above, matter is a metaphysical constituent of\nthings and is necessary for explaining change, receptivity of\naccidents, and individuation. All created things must have matter and\nform in their constitution. But, whereas things that are subjected to\ngeneration and corruption are made out of natural or physical matter\n(materia physica)—matter in the proper sense\n(proprie)—spiritual things have matter in the common\nsense (communiter) or metaphysical matter (materia\nmetaphysica) as the subject of the spiritual form (DOS 265; QLIIS\n82), defined as potential being (QLIIS 14). Matter in this sense\nexplains individuation (DOS 266–269) as well as change (other\nthan substantial change) that takes place in spiritual substances (DOS\n320). (For Kilwardby's view in the context of Thirteenth Century\ndebates on matter, see Donati 2013) \nThroughout his career, Kilwardby holds two theories as to the\nprinciple of individuation: one, which he defends in his Parisian\nperiod, attributes to matter the role of the cause of individuation\n(NSLP 7, 39), and another, in the mature works of his Oxford and\nCanterbury stay, claims that individuation is caused by both matter\nand form. \nThe main principle of Kilwardby's ontology is that every thing that\nexists outside the soul either exists in an individual or is itself an\nindividual (QLIIS 17, 64). As matter and form constitute all\nsubstances, matter and form are the two possible causes of\nindividuation. It cannot be matter on its own because matter receives\nits determinations by form—matter is, in essence, one in all\nthings (QLIIS 17, 65). The cause can be form, but in this case it will\nbe either accidental or substantial. He promptly dismisses the first\npossibility, since accidents inhere in an already constituted primary\nsubstance, that is, they follow the constitution of an individual\nsubstance rather than explain the constitution of that substance as an\nindividual. This is not to say, he points out, that there are\nindividuals without accidents: an individual is always temporally and\nspatially located, even though one can think of an individual without\nreference to this particular place and time (QLIIS 17, 68). \nHis final answer is that both matter and form are principles of\nindividuation: matter as the passive cause (causa receptiva;\nhe also calls it the causa sine qua non), form as the active\ncause (QLIIS 17, 64). The perfection of individuation is achieved by\nthe last species (the species specialissima), which completes\nthe individual (QLIIS 17, 67). Form, arriving at matter, designates\nmatter and designating matter, designates itself. The designative\naction (signatio) of form on matter is the cause of an actual\nexisting being (QLIS 71). \nThe distinctive property of the individual as such is precisely this\nactual existence (actualis exsistentia: QLIIS 17, 65; QLIII1S\n9, 39). Kilwardby rejects the view that individuals have an essence in\naddition to a form of the species. Otherwise, the essence of the\nindividual would be distinct from the essence of the universal, and\neach individual would be made of two essences (Lewry 1978, 246). The\nindividual has only matter in addition to the\n species.[10]\n For Kilwardby, there are no individual forms, only individuated\nforms. \nThe individuated form of the species is accidental to the species\nbecause a particular instantiation is irrelevant to the\nspecies—and essential to the individual—as there would be\nno individual without a form of the species (QLIIS 17, 65). This idea\nis the basis of Kilwardby's moderate realism of universals and his\ndoctrine of the plurality of substantial forms: universal\nforms—genera and species—exist in individual things as\ntheir constituents, but as such (that is, as forms existing in\nindividual things) they are not universal forms but individuated and\nindividuating forms. As universal forms, they exist in the intellect\nonly, by abstraction from the individuals that instantiate them. There\nis in the world outside the mind no universal human being aside from\nindividual human beings. \nKilwardby's lengthiest discussion on sense perception is found in the\nwork De spiritu fantastico. Here, Kilwardby argues that for\nan act of perception to occur, certain requirements need to be\nfulfilled: there needs to be an object, a sense organ, and a medium\nbetween them; the object must issue/generate a likeness (image or\nspecies) of itself by means of which it can be known (since nothing in\nthe world can be known except by generating a species of itself). The\nlikeness must be able to change the medium and then the sense organ.\nBoth the medium and the sense organ, in different ways, must be\nappropriate to the likeness, that is, must be receptive of it. In the\ncase of sight, for instance, the medium must be transparent, and there\nmust be light (E 5, 42). \nThe change in medium is different from that in the sense organ, and\ndifferent species seem to move (in) the medium in different ways.\nKilwardby connects this with the materiality and even the different\ndegrees of materiality of the species: the species of smell and\nhearing move with the airwaves, whereas the species of color do\n not.[11]\n With respect to sight—the prototypical sense discussed in\nmedieval theories of perception—the object, according to the\nrules of optics, must stand opposite the perceiver's eyes, and the\nspecies move along a straight line. There are two objects of sight:\nlight and color; but whereas color or the colored thing is that which\nis perceived, light is that which makes this perception possible\n(QLIII2S 5, 18). Light is not perceived as such; only the mind (not\nthe sensory soul) is able to distinguish light from color, by\nreflection (QLIII2S 26, 190). \nIn DSF 103, Kilwardby provides a careful synthesis of the process of\nperception, which can be described in terms of the two\nmotions—outwards and inwards: \nFor there are two things in sensing, namely, the more attentive action\nof the soul in the body which is acted upon, and the perception of\nthis action. (trans. Broadie) \nThe acted-upon refers to the affection (passio) of the sense\norgans by the sensible object, more precisely, the impressing of the\nlikeness of the object in the sense organ. The object issues forth the\nsensible species that, via the medium, come to be in the sense organ.\nThis affection is a certain kind of alteration through which a\ndisposition is perfected—in other words, the potentiality of the\nsense organ to receive a certain quality is actualized (DSF\n61–62). \nThe attentive action is the sensory soul's assimilating\nitself to the species received in the sense organ, and by means of\nthis assimilation makes in and from itself (DSF 126) an image or\nlikeness of the sensible species (DSF 166; 121; 185). It is by means\nof this assimilative action that the image of the sensible object\ncomes into being in the sensory soul. The sensory soul (not the\nintellective, DSF 140) forms the image as if by natural instinct\n(instinctu naturali), that is, it has a natural capacity to\ndo it (DSF 128). \nFinally, the perception of the soul's action is “to sense in\nitself the image which it has formed in itself” (or, “the\nturning of the eye <of the soul> upon itself, in and by\nmeans of which the image is sensed” (DSF 125), that is, the\nperception of the object. In other words, the sensory soul turns its\neye upon itself and sees the sensible object through the image made by\nitself. It does not distinguish the image in the sense organ from the\nimage in itself (DSF 104), and neither image is that which is\nperceived. The object of perception is the external thing (DSF\n110–11) and not the image by which the thing is known (quo\nres cognoscitur) (QLIS 89, 280). \nThe soul is the active element in the process in that perception is\npossible due to the soul's intentional state with respect to the\naffection of the organ. The reason the soul permanently attends to the\nbody and its affections is that it is proper for the soul, as the form\nof the body, to take care of the well-being and preservation of the\nbody (DSF 100–101; Silva 2008). The soul avoids all affections\nthat can injure and damage the body and its organs, which are the\nsoul's instruments for acquiring information about the external world.\nThe soul's control over the body is exercised through the mediation of\nthe corporeal sensitive spirit, made of fine\n matter.[12] \nWhen human beings sleep, the sense organs continue to be impressed by\nthe species from sense objects; however, this impression, without the\nattention of the soul, does not give rise to any act of perception\n(DSF 203; Silva 2010), and it is arguable whether on these occasions\nthe image in the soul is actually made. \nThe theory raises the question about the correspondence between the\nimage made by the soul in imitating one received in the sense organs\nrather than by taking in the species of the external thing. Kilwardby\ndismisses that hypothetical objection by claiming that the sensory\nsoul is from the outset endowed with such a capacity and by restating\nthat the image does correspond to the external object. \nThe process includes a physically based account—the generation\nof the species (which have different degrees of materiality), its\npropagation through the medium, and its affection of sense\norgans—and a spiritual/immaterial account that explains what\nfollows from the affection of the sense organ by the species.\nAccording to this second account, the soul reacts to this affection\nand makes the image of the object. It is this image that remains in\nmemory, available for acts of imagination. \nKilwardby insists at great length on denying any efficient causality\nto the object, that is, he refuses to take perceptual acts as being\ncaused by the external object or its species. The object is the\nnecessary occasion and the causa sine qua non (otherwise\nthere would be nothing to be perceived) but not the sufficient cause\nof perception (DSF 103; 123). The efficient cause per se of perception\nis the immaterial soul—the division into sensory faculties is\ninstrumental to the process and in most of this part of the treatise\nKilwardby talks of the operations of the sensory soul (which he also\ncalls the ‘incorporeal sensitive spirit’) as a unified\nentity. \nKilwardby's theory of sense perception is, on the one hand,\nAristotelian because he accepts that our knowledge of the world\noriginates in sense experience; he describes the process of perception\nas a being-affected. On the other hand, it is Augustinian because he\nlimits the efficient role of the object to the affection of the sense\norgans; he takes the soul to be the true efficient cause of\nperception, reacting to the body's being affected and making in and\nfrom itself the images of exterior objects; he grounds his theory on\nthe ontological assumption of a hierarchy of being where only things\nat the same or higher level can affect each other, which forbids the\naction of anything corporeal upon something incorporeal. The body\nfeels through the soul (and the soul through itself) because, as to\nfeel is a kind of being-affected, the body cannot affect the soul, but\nthe soul can affect the body. \nAlthough much of his account of perception is made in terms of the\nsensory soul and its operations and less in terms of faculty\npsychology, it emerges from Kilwardby's account that a major cognitive\nrole is assigned to memory—a primacy found also in intellectual\ncognition (where memory represents God, the Father, in the analogy of\nthe powers of the mind and in the Divine Trinity (see especially QLIS\n35–37)). Contrasting Aristotle's and Augustine's views on\nmemory, Kilwardby argues that the power of memory is responsible for\nreceiving the images of objects of knowledge by natural assimilation,\nfor preserving the images of sensible objects, and for making them\navailable for the powers of imagination (sensory memory) and intellect\n(intellectual memory) (QLIS 62, 181). Kilwardby distinguishes between\na sensory memory and a rational memory, further divided into inferior\n(dedicated to sensible things) and superior (dedicated to the\nintelligible objects) (QLIS 62, 179). The rational memory (the Father)\ngenerates understanding by presenting the intelligible species to the\nintellect (the Son; see QLIS 35; 37; QLIIS 77, 213–214).\nUnderstanding is a form of a vision of an image generated by rational\nmemory, in the same way as an object generates an image of itself\n(QLIS 35). In both cases, the soul has, in the first moment, the image\nand in the second moment turns its eye (of the sensory soul and of the\nmind) to see (know) the object. \nFollowing Grosseteste, Kilwardby took human knowledge to comprise the\ncomprehension of the truth of contingently existing things, of what\nfrequently is in the same way, and of what has an absolute way of\nbeing and is immutable—such as the principles and conclusions of\na demonstration. Of these, the highest type of knowledge is that found\nin the conclusion of a demonstration (NLP I.5, 31–32). \nAlthough we can know particular objects by means of perception, there\nis scientia only of what always is in the same way (NLP I.10,\n48), that is, of what is eternal and incorruptible; in other words,\nscientia is about universals. \nThe knowledge of universals is reached through induction from the\nknowledge of singulars received through the senses (NLPA 171; DOS\n196). Kilwardby describes the process in the following way: sensible\nspecies are retained in the absence of a sensible thing by memory, and\nfrom a multitude of memories arises experience, that is, a first\ncomparison of what is common to the species, not yet a universal. The\nintellect is then able to discover the essential likeness\n(essentialis similitudo) or common nature (ratio\nuniuersalis) in which the sense data agree (NLP II.33,\n503–504; DOS 7–8; NLPA 171–2). The universal is,\nthen, the essential reason for agreement of many images of the same\nnature (QLIIS 78, 222.236–8; QLIIS 17, 71; Lewry 1978, 244). \nIn NLPor, Kilwardby describes the process of abstraction as the\ninteraction of two aspects of the intellect: the agent intellect\nabstracts the intelligible species (species intelligibiles)\nfrom the images of sensible things acquired through sense perception.\nThe intelligible species are then deposited in the possible intellect\n(Lewry 1978, 241), which is bare or naked previous to this reception\n(QLIS 4, 12; QLIS 35, 83 and in DSF 14). \nThe universal is at rest in the soul, as it is the ratio\ncommon to all those particulars which instantiate it (NLP 33,\n504–505). Kilwardby argues that Peter and Paul differ as\nindividuals (they have their own matter and form), but they have\nsomething in common—their essence. Universals are, therefore,\nthis agreement (convenientia) in essence. Two human beings\nagree essentially agreeing in their humanity when that humanity is\nconsidered not as individuated, but as abstracted from any concrete\nand individual being (QLIIS 17, 71). The universal is one thing\n(res una) not in the sense of being an individual thing but\nin the sense of being a unity of agreement or likeness of individual\nthings outside the mind (QLIIS 17, 72). \nIt is this idea (together with individuation) that constitutes the\nbasis for Kilwardby's criticism of Averroes' monopsychism—a\ntheory he qualifies as being against faith and philosophy as well as\ncontrary to Aristotle's intention (QLIIS 78, 216). Averroes had argued\nfor his theory that there is only one soul (una anima numero)\ncommon to all human beings with the contention (among others) that the\nunity of the representative species requires the unity of the soul\n(QLIIS 78,\n 215).[13]\n Kilwardby argues against this idea, by claiming that the different\nlikenesses present in different souls are one only in species (QLIIS\n78, 221), in the same way as individual human beings, such as Plato\nand Socrates, correspond as species, that is, as human beings, not as\nindividuals. They are numerically multiple according to the\nmultiplicity of souls in which they are received, but they correspond\nto each other in being representations of one and the same thing, for\nexample, Plato (QLIIS 78, 218–219; see also QLIIS 17, 71). The\nsame is valid for the universal, which is abstracted from many similar\nlikenesses, such as the likenesses of Socrates and Plato. It is also\n(incidentally) multiplied according to the multiplicity of intellects\nin which it exists. It is one only in species as the ratio in\nwhich the many likenesses of the same nature essentially agree (QLIIS\n78, 22). \nTherefore, sense perception and intellectual cognition are\ncomplementary. Even though there are intelligible things that are not\nsensory, all sensory things are intelligible (DOS 430–431): they\nare known by the senses as particulars and ordered towards further\nintellectual cognition (DOS 433). “Sensation is”,\nKilwardby says, “the gate to human cognition”, because\nthere can be no knowledge of universals (and demonstration) without\nthe knowledge of particulars (NLP I.33, 509; DOS 433). \nHuman knowledge proceeds from that which is acquired through the\nsenses, i.e., particular intentions, to the knowledge of that which is\nmore distant from the senses (DOS 627), that is, the common intentions\n(communes raciones siue communes intenciones) which are\nabstracted from them (QLIII1S 44, 189; see also see Lewry Por, 360).\nAlthough acts of perception are about singular objects, it is by means\nof sense perception that cognition of universals is accomplished (by\nabstraction of those individuating circumstances) (NLP II.33, 505):\none perceives Callias, but we cognize Callias not as an individual\nhuman being but qua human being as such. But one needs to\nproceed from what is better known to us (that is, that which is\nimmediate in sense perception, the singular thing) to what is better\nknown by nature or more removed from the senses (DOS 238; see also NLP\nI.7, 39; NSLP 18, 139–140), as scientific knowledge is not about\nthe particular object immediately perceived but the universal (DOS\n436). We come to perceive first universals, then particulars, as when,\nat a distance, we perceive first a body, then that it is an animated\nbody, then that it is an animal, and finally that it is this\nparticular animal—it must be said, though, as Avicenna points\nout (says Kilwardby), that what is perceived in this process is a\nconfused universal (universale confusum), i.e., a universal\n“fused together”, as it were, (to use Peter King's happy\nliteral translation) with a particular (NSLP 18; see also NLP I.7, 40;\nNLPor 11, M 9vb). \nAccording to Kilwardby, universals exist, having different modes, in\nand outside the mind (QLIIS 78, 218). The universal is one over many\n(unum preter multa) according to its own essence\n(secundum suam essentiam), but it exists in the many as\ntheir essence (secundum esse) (NLP 33,\n504–505). For him, a universal on account of its being universal\n(secundum rationem qua universale est), can be\nconsidered: \nIn a clear expression of his realist commitment, Kilwardby points out\nthat universals are not fictions of the mind: they are found in\nindividual existing things as their essences; otherwise there would be\nno univocal predication or definition, and science would be about\nfictions of the mind (QLIIS 17, 69; 73). Universals can be said of\nmany because they exist in the many that exemplify them (QLIIS 78,\n220). \nIt is important to notice how Kilwardby rules out the association of\nuniversals with divine ideas, as essences of things separate from\nmatter, as Plato claimed (ut Plato posuit), as those are not\nbearing any role in human cognition. In NSLPor 2 (M 2vb), he states\nthat universals exist in God's mind as exemplary and formal causes,\nbut science is about universals that exist in and are abstracted from\nindividual things; thus, the ideas (ydee) that exist in God's\nmind from eternity are of no use to science (NLP I.36,\n230–231). \nAs Kilwardby frequently remarks, following Aristotle's dictum\nin the Metaphysics, human beings have a natural desire for\nknowledge (DOS 6): Omnes homines natura scire desiderant.\nKnowledge or more properly scientific knowledge (scientia) is\ndefined as the knowledge of the conclusion of a demonstrative\nsyllogism (based on Aristotle's doctrine in the Posterior\nAnalytics). As many other authors of the period, Kilwardby\ndistinguishes between the understanding of the principles\n (intellectus),[14]\n and the knowledge of the conclusion\n (scientia).[15] \nTruth, Kilwardby says, is an equivocal notion: the truth\n(ueritas) of a thing is the thing's being (esse),\nthat is, what the thing genuinely is (NSLPery I.2, M 46vb; see also\nNSLP 17, 130), namely, its essence or quiddity (essentia vel\nquidditas) that is signified by its definition (QLIS 44,\n 141).[16]\n Things themselves, and the forms or intentiones through\nwhich things come to be known, lack any composition, that is, they are\nneither affirmed nor denied, and therefore they are not true or false\nas are declarative sentences (NSLPery, p. 16. See also NSLP 17, 124).\nTruth is the correspondence of the thing and concept (adequatio\nrei et intellectus), a definition Kilwardby takes from Avicenna\n(NSLPery\n I.9).[17] \nAs the intellect is able to consider separately things that are\ntogether and to separate things that are not together in reality,\ntruth and falsity have to do with the composition and division of the\nspecies of things in the soul and not in extramental\n things.[18]\n That is to say, ‘the composition and division that thought\nbrings about must have reference to the being and not-being of things\noutside\n thought’.[19]\n Complex expressions are true in cases in which they conform to the\nway the things are outside the combining mind, and they are signified\nby the terms—the predicate and\n subject.[20]\n The intentions (intentiones or passiones animae) in\nthe soul and their combinations exist in the soul as signs\n(signa) of extra-mental things. \nAlthough the logician is not primarily concerned with the way things\n are,[21]\n he must know how they are in order to make statements that are true\nwith respect to the being of things outside the composing and dividing\nmind (DOS 521), because logic does not teach how to reason in a\nfictional mode (DOS 578). The one that combines or divides must know\nthe properties or modes of things in which things themselves agree or\ndisagree (DOS 577). \nAccording to a common conception of truth, for a proposition to be\ntrue, the actual existence of what is signified by its terms is\nrequired; however, terms can also be considered without this\ncorrespondence to something existing outside the mind(LPA I.18,\n388-95). In NSLPery (I.7) Kilwardby considers the case of the\nchimera: \nBut it must be said that when I say that every statement is something\nof something, this ‘something’ is taken in a common way,\neither as something in speech only or in reality: thus when non being\nis stated in reality, it is a statement about being at least in\ndiscourse, as when one talks about chimeras or such\n things.[22] \nA chimera corresponds at least to something in speech or in the\ncomposing mind, even if not to something in the extra-mental\n world.[23]\n The word ‘chimera’ signifies what exists only in the\nsoul; therefore, its definition shows not the essence of a thing (as\nthere are no extra-mental things such as chimeras) but what the name\nsignifies (NLP II.7, 381–382). \nThe actual existence of things outside the soul is not always required\nfor a (affirmative) proposition (here understood as a statement-making\nsentence) to be true (NLP II.7, 381). Nonbeing can be understood as\nbeing not yet actual but in potency only, that is, that has an\naptitude to exist in\n actuality.[24]\n About those things that can but do not yet exist outside the soul,\nexistence is taken to refer to the (common) nature and not to the\nindividual (NLP II.7, 379): when animal is predicated of human being\nor when one says that an eclipse is the privation of light, it is not\nnecessary to know whether or not this is actually the case because a\nhuman being is always an animal, and an eclipse cannot be but the\nprivation of light. Thus, even if no human being actually existed\noutside the soul, even then the proposition ‘homo est\nanimal’ would still be true (NLP II.7, 381). \nKilwardby classifies signs into \nOf those signs that are signs of something else (ii′*), some\nsignify by convention (ad placitum, which Kilwardby proves by\ntheir not being the same for everybody); others signify naturally\n(like the sounds of non-rational animals). Of those words that signify\nby convention, some are simple expressions, and others are complex\nexpressions (oratio or enuntiatio). Only\nsignificative complex expressions are true or false; simple\nexpressions are neither true nor false (NSLPery I.2). \nSignifying by convention is the result of an original (voluntary)\nimposition of a significatum upon a word, primarily conceived\nof as a spoken word (vox) – a modulated sound (DOS 488;\nsee also QLIVS 42,\n 224).[25]\n A word signifies the passio mentis and the thing outside the\nsoul (QLIVS 11, 47). Spoken words signify primarily the passio\nanimi (or species intelligibilis or\nintellectus; Lewry Pery, 289) and signify things via thoughts\n(uoces sunt note intellectuum, et sic rerum) (QLIS 144, 143).\nThe passio, being a likeness of a thing in the\nmind—received rather than made by us—is common to all\nhuman beings (LPA ed. 1516, 82rb). \nKilwardby argues that only human beings proffer meaningful utterances\nbecause, as Priscian points out, the articulate vocal sound (uox\narticulata) uttered by humans is tied together\n(copulata) with a sensus mentis or\nintellectus in the mind of the speaker; thus only beings that\nhave minds can produce significative\n utterances.[26]\n Moreover, the production of the vox litterata requires the\ncontrol of the modulation of sounds—what Kilwardby calls the\nfigure in the air (through which the utterances are\ntransmitted)—on a regular basis, that is, always the same figure\nfor the same word. This is done by the sensory soul under the control\nof the rational soul (NLPA, 124–125). This explains not only why\nmeaningful articulate vocal sounds are signs but also their primacy as\nefficiently caused by the soul (see Mora-Márquez 2014). \nThere are, therefore, two aspects of spoken language: on the one hand,\nthe vox, as an articulate sound, causes a natural change in\nboth the medium and the ear of the one who hears it (DOS 147; NLPA\n127–128); on the other, the utterance, as something heard,\nbrings about an act of the intellect of the listener (DOS 425; NSLPery\nI.1). To speak (dicere) in the proper sense means expressing\nthe likeness of a thing in order to make known that of which it is the\nlikeness (QLIS 37, 106). In that sense, a meaningful utterance should\nbe called ‘nota’ with respect to the speaker, because it\nrefers to the meaning conveyed by the speaker (the species\nintelligibilis), and it should be called ‘signum’\nwith respect to the one who hears it, because it refers to the\nmaterial/sensitive aspect of the sign (NSLPery I.2; see Lewry 1978,\n289; Rosier 1994, 97–98; Marmo 1997, 139–40). As noted by\nRosier, Sirridge, and Kneepkens (see Bibliography), one of the main\ncontributions of Kilwardby (and Bacon and others in the intentionalist\ngrammatical tradition) is the emphasis on two levels of completeness\nof speech: one, concerning the word's modes of signifying and the\nother concerning the way the hearer understands or interprets the\nintention of the speaker (intentio proferentis). \nOne consequence of the conventional nature of language, according to\nwhich the relation between a sign and a significate is imposed on the\nsign by a voluntary act on the part of the impositor, is that\nthe change in what is signified by the sign does not require a change\nin the sign (NLPery I.1; Lewry 1981). On the other contrary, in the\ncase of natural signs, such as paleness from fear or redness from\nshame, the change in the thing signified implies a change of its\n sign.[27] \nKilwardby adopts Robert Grosseteste's distinction between four main\nsenses of 'to know' (scire: (i) in a general sense, the\ncomprehension of the truth of contingent things, (ii) in a common\nsense, the comprehension of the truth of things that often are, (iii)\nproperly, the comprehension of the truth of things that are immutable,\n(iv) most properly, the comprehension of the truth of things that\nalways are the same and the truth of which depends on what is prior\n(NLP I.5; Silva 2012, 216; Corbini 2013, 166). So, whereas in a sense\nto know can be said of sense perception, it is properly and most\nproperly said of what is universal and of what is necessary (DOS 379).\nSuch knowledge is found in the premises/principles and above all in\nthe knowledge of the conclusions of demonstrations (iii and iv,\nabove). Scientific knowledge (scientia) is then more properly\ndemonstrative reasoning (DOS 381). \nA demonstration is a syllogism that brings about knowledge (NLP I.5,\n31). A syllogism is “an expression in which a conclusion follows\nof necessity when certain things have been asserted” (DOS 493,\nKretzmann 1988, 265). The material principles of the syllogism are the\nthree terms (remote matter)—the two extremes (major, minor) and\nthe middle—combined into two premises (proximate matter). The\nconclusion is not part of the syllogism. \nA demonstration must have as starting-points appropriate principles\n(NLP I.19, 106–7): true, first, immediate, prior to, better\nknown than, and causes of the conclusion (NLP I.6, 34; DOS 503; 558).\nOf these conditions, to be true, first (or primitive), and immediate\nare the central ones: first because there is nothing prior to it in\nits kind—otherwise the source of scientific knowledge rests on\nan infinite series of demonstrations (NLP I.8, 43; I.11, 53);\nimmediate because there is no medium between the subject and predicate\n(NLP 6, 38). Whereas to be true, first, and immediate are the\nqualifications that concern what the principles are in themselves (and\nthus the ones which belong to their definition), the others—for\nexample, to be better known—qualify the principles with respect\nto the conclusion (NLP I.8, 44; I.10, 49). \nKilwardby presents the following division of the first principles (NLP\nI.9, 45): \nKilwardby denies (NLP II.33) that the first principles of\ndemonstration are innate or demonstrable. Kilwardby argues, instead,\nthat they are acquired from pre-existing sensory knowledge (NLP II.33,\n506). The knowledge of propositions must be preceded by the knowledge\nof the terms that enter into its composition, that is, what it is that\nis predicated and what the thing is of which something is predicated\n(NLP I.2, 16). By abstraction the intellect comes to know the\nuniversals that function as subject and predicate in syllogistic\npropositions. \nThese principles are known by themselves (sunt per se nota)\n(DOS 331; 503; QLIII2S 1, 7); our certitude of them, Kilwardby says,\ncomes from the ‘light of truth’ (QLIS 12, 31). It is by\nthe same light of truth that one assents to the principles/premises\nfrom the knowledge (notitia) of the terms that constitute\nthem as well as to the conclusion from the premises (NLP I.11, 54).\nThis act of assent is the result of some kind of illumination from the\nsoul's cognitive powers (QLIII2S 1, 7). The conclusion, he asserts, is\nthe terminus of the act of intellectual cognition, but the middle term\nis what makes it possible, just as light makes bodily seeing possible\n(QLIII2S 5, 18–20). One assents to the conclusion because one\ncomes to see how the middle term leads to the conclusion and makes the\nconclusion worthy of assent (QLIS 13, 33.2–3; see also DOS\n472). \nIn the highest type of demonstration, the potissima\ndemonstratio, the middle term is a causal definition (NLP II.3,\n343.12–14; DOS 527; LPA prologue) and the definition of the\npredicate (NSLP 6, 29; DOS 563). The middle term allows for the\ndemonstration of the predicate to belong per se et propter\nquid to the subject (NLP I.20, 117). The paradigmatic\ndemonstration is a syllogism of the first figure in the first mood,\nthat is with two universal premises because the relation of necessity\nbetween premises and conclusion is more evident (see Thom 2013,\n144-47). \nIt is not, however, enough for a principle of demonstration to be\ntrue; it must be necessary. A necessary conclusion follows from\nnecessary premises (NLP I. 19, 110–113). The kind of\nuniversality required for demonstration is not the same as that of a\nuniversal acquired through abstraction, which is said of many (ut\ndicatur de multis)—the kind described in the\nPerihermeneias and in Porphyry's Isasoge—but\nthe universal that must be said of all and always (de quodlibet et\nsemper et\n primo).[29]\n The kind of necessity Kilwardby has in mind is what applies to all\n(things under the subject), on account of what they are, and it is\nuniversal (de omni, per se, and universale)\n(NLP I.12, 62). \nThere must, however, exist a science whose aim is to discover and\nteach the method of how to investigate, through correct reasoning,\nwhat is not known from what is known. It cannot be metaphysics because\nthis science regards things apart from motion. A syllogism, however,\nis a kind of motion where the properties are deduced from the\nsubject(-matter) and the conclusion from the premises (NLP prologue,\n4). That science is logic. Since logic has the task of discovering a\nmethod of knowing that can be used by all sciences (LPA prologue),\nlogic is thought of as the modus scientiarum, or the science\nof sciences (scientia scientiarum). Proficiency in the way of\nreasoning allows for the discovery of truth in every field of inquiry\n(DOS 419), even though every science demonstrates according to the\npossibilities of its matter (NLP II.34, 512). In order to accomplish\nthis task, logic needs to teach how to combine one term with another\n(or divide one from another), the species of combinations and\ndivisions corresponding to the species of propositions or statements\n(DOS 517). Logic also relates things to one another by means of a\nmiddle term in the syllogism, which is logic's subject matter. \nThe different operations of the intellect producing different\nlinguistic units are studied in Aristotle's different logical works:\nthe simple significative expression (simplex sermo\nsignificativus or the dicibile sine complexione),\nsignificative of one of the ten genera of things, is the\nsubject-matter of the Categories; the declarative sentence\n(or the dicibile ordinatum cum dicibili interpretatione\nenuntiativa) is dealt with in the Perihermeneias; and\nthe syllogism (or the dicibile ordinatum cum dicibili in\ncomplexione duorum extremorum) in the Prior Analytics.\nThe syllogistic form—which Aristotle presents in the Prior\nAnalytics—can then be applied to any matter whatsoever,\nprobable or necessary (DOS 502). The Posterior Analytics\npresents the demonstrative syllogism, made of necessary matter; the\nTopics the dialectical syllogism of probable matter; and the\nSophistical Refutations deals with sophistical matter, i.e.,\nfallacious reasoning (DOS 503). \nNow, logic considers things in one of two ways: in terms of first\nintentions, that is, as the things themselves and thus belonging to\none of the ten highest kinds of being—the categories; in terms\nof second intentions, that is, things as considered by the intellect\nand in respect to other things (DOS 459). They are called first and\nsecond because only after knowing things themselves can we consider\ntheir mutual relations (DOS 459): second intentions are about first\nintentions. ‘Substance’, ‘quality’, and such\nare names of first intentions, whereas ‘universal’,\n‘particular’, ‘to be an antecedent’, ‘to\nbe a consequent’, and such are names of second intentions. \nKilwardby discusses second intentions in the context of a distinction\nhe proposes between reasoning as a subject of a discipline (logic) and\nas an instrument which is common to all disciplines (DOS 455; LT 39,\n125). Reasoning in one and the other case is the same from the point\nof form, since the moods and figures are the same; but it is different\nin respect to matter (probable and necessary, DOS 500–504). As\nan instrument, reasoning is about things themselves—those that\nbelong to their subject matters, such as lines and figures in\ngeometry—because the subject matter of particular disciplines is\nthings (DOS 455; 477). By comparison, as the subject matter of logic,\nreasoning makes no reference to things themselves but to their\naccounts/reasons (rationes rerum), that is, the modes by\nmeans of which they are reasoned about (DOS 463). The logician is not\nconcerned primarily with things themselves, the res naturae\nor first intentions, but with the res rationis or second\nintentions; that is, he is not concerned with the things signified by\nthe subject and predicate terms of a proposition but with subject and\npredicate as such (QLIS 90; see also NSLP Prooemium, 4; 5, 20; Pini\n2002, 21–22). \nThings themselves – things that fall into one of the\ncategories—are not in our soul, only their accounts\n(rationes) are (DOS 448–49). These modes or accounts\n(modi rerum sive rationes) are abstracted from things and\ncompared to each other as if they were the things themselves being\ncompared (DOS 451). It is the mode or account of things that makes it\npossible for us to reason about them (faciunt res\nrationalibes: DOS 450; rationes rerum et modi per quos res\nsunt rationabiles: DOS 463). Logic then considers the modi\nsive rationes rerum, the properties of things in so far as they\nare thought or compared to one another, which enables combining them\ninto propositions and demonstrations and arriving at scientific\nknowledge (scientia). (See DOS 449) Without the consideration\nof things together with the rationes rerum—for example,\nthat ‘divisible’ is more universal than\n‘line’—no reasoning could be done about them (DOS\n450). \nReasoning needs to be considered as independently as possible from any\nparticular subject matter because logic examines the method of correct\nreasoning, which can then be taught and applied to all the other\nsciences (the syllogism simpliciter has matter, premises, and\nterms. In that sense, they can be replaced by transcendent matter,\nsuch as A, B, C; each particular science then replaces the terms with\nits own subject, properties, causes, and so on—DOS 452. In that\nsense also, the syllogism simpliciter is not productive of\nknowledge or belief—LPA prologue (see Thom 2013, 140). \nThus, Kilwardby's meaning of first and second intentions cannot be\nconfused with the meaning these terms acquire later on. His use of\nsecond intentions as proper to logic shows how he understands this\nnotion in the context of his theory of reasoning and of logic as being\nthe science of reasoning—that is, it studies the process of\nreasoning in such a way that it can be used by all the other sciences\nas an instrument for the discovery of truth.  \nKilwardby adopts a scheme of ordination for the different sciences or\ndisciplines, and it is largely based on the model of Hugh of St.\nVictor's Didascalicon: De studii legendi, a widely circulated\nand immensely influential work from the twelfth century on the\nclassification of sciences (see Silva 2013). As with the work of his\n(Augustinian) predecessor and notable influence, the DOS had a fame of\nits own and remains one of the most relevant medieval works of its\nkind. \nHugh's Didascalicon (itself inspired by previous\nclassifications—see Weisheipl 1965) however only allows for\nKilwardby to include the sciences in what is called knowledge—to\nthis he must (and does) add the principles of the division of the\ndifferent sciences into various fields of inquiry and then the\nclassification of the different sciences within a certain field of\ninquiry. Kilwardby goes beyond Hugh and previous classifications not\nso much with regard to the principles of division and classification,\nbut rather with regard to what is implied in science—that is to\nsay, with regard to the necessary requirements for something to be\nconsidered scientific in a certain field of inquiry and process of\ndiscovery according to the Aristotelian deductive model of science.\nAny science (not\n art)[30]\n needs to fulfill three main requirements: first, it should have a\nsubject matter (DOS 167; 221); second, it should present the parts and\nspecies of a science's subject matter and their properties (DOS\n650–652); third, it should take into account the first common\nprinciples of demonstration and have a set principles appropriated to\nits genus (NLP I.23). \nThe modus sciencie, according to the prologue of his NLPery,\n“consists of the speculation about the proven properties of the\nparts and species of the subject matter” (Lewry Pery, 382; see\nalso NLP prologue; LT 50, 125), which is done by means of definition,\ndivision, and collection. By means of division one comes to know the\nsubject of a science; through collection or reasoning one comes to\nknow the properties of the parts and species of the subject; from\ndefinition, one comes to know the parts and species of the subject\n(DOS 524–525; QLIS 7, 18–19). \nA major difficulty is whether one and the same\nscience—metaphysics—can have such two distinct objects as\nGod and creatures, still respecting the principle of the unity of\nscience (DOS 221; see also QLIS 4). In DOS 226 Kilwardby claims that\nunity by analogy is sufficient for the science of being qua being\n(scientia de ente), metaphysics, to be the field of inquiry\nthat has God and the creatures as objects of inquiry. Being and\nsubstance can be predicated by analogy of God and creatures: of God\nprimarily and properly, of creatures in a participative and less\nproper way. God cannot be known directly, but He can be known by means\nof His effects and by negation, in the same way our bodily eyes do not\nsee themselves except through a mirror (DOS 225). \nA major issue in the division and classification of disciplinary\nfields is the relation between subaltern sciences. In DOS 324\nKilwardby advocates three criteria for subalternation: \nOne example of this subordination is found in the relation between the\nscience of geometry and its subordinate sciences. Geometry is the part\nof speculative philosophy dedicated to the study of limited magnitude\n(finite limited quantity abstracted from natural matter), its parts,\nand their properties (DOS 64–65). Astronomy and optics are two\nsuch subordinated sciences. Astronomy is a speculative science that\nhas as its object the magnitude of celestial bodies and the distance\nbetween them (DOS 72), whereas optics is defined as the speculative\nscience that has as its object the diverse modes of vision, focusing\non the nature of visual rays. It belongs to the genus that is the\nsubject matter of geometry because the visual rays propagate\nrectilinearly (DOS 77). \nKilwardby begins his text in a clarifying manner of distinguishing\nbetween those sciences that are about human words and actions and\nthose that are about what is divine (DOS 1; 654). The science of the\ndivine is theology, focused on the study of the Sacred Scripture. Of\nthe human sciences, some are commendable (philosophy), others vicious\nor illicit (magic). In DOS, Kilwardby is mostly concerned with the\nsciences of human invention. He further divides philosophy into\nspeculative—the name that designates a group of sciences\nconstituted by physics, mathematics, and metaphysics—and another\ngroup classified under the heading ‘about human things’,\nthat is, the results of human intentionality (QLIS 90, 286); it\nincludes the active sciences and the sciences of language. The former\ndivides into mechanics and ethics, the latter into grammar, logic, and\nrhetoric. Mathematics includes the sciences of the\nquadrivium, that is, the four sciences of things as they were\nknown in the Middle Ages (geometry, astronomy, music, and\narithmetic). \nScience, in the sense of knowledge, falls into one of three kinds: (i)\nthat which is primarily oriented to and necessary for salvation; (ii)\nthat which is useful in the search for truth and righteous\nliving—for living an honest life—but not sufficient for\nsalvation; (iii) that which is useless in both respects and is\nconnected with vanity (DOS 1–2). This grouping obeys a general\nprinciple, originated from Augustine, which sets up the direction for\nmedieval learning: knowledge must be directed towards virtue (DOS\n639). This same aspect is also present in the consideration of the\norder of the sciences, in which all sciences are preparatory to the\nscience of the higher end: all sciences are subordinated to, or at the\nservice of (famulantur), theology. \nKilwardby's criterion for classification is the object of the sciences\n(Alessio 2001, 108–9): “science must be divided according\nto the division of things about which it is” (DOS 5). “The\ndiversity of sciences”, he says, “results from the\ndiversity of their subject matters” (DOS 108). Sciences are\norganized, as in the Boethian scheme, according to the level of\nabstraction of their objects of study from matter. Speculative\nsciences rank highest (DOS 203) and among them metaphysics.\nMetaphysics deals with being without qualification\n(simpliciter), whereas mathematics and physics deal with\nparticular kinds of being (DOS 323; NLP II.11, 417). Metaphysics\nconsiders substance and its principles – matter and form –\nper se, that is, apart from change and privation, whereas physics\n(natural philosophy) considers substance as mutable and therefore\nmatter and form (and privation) as principles of change (DOS 232);\nmathematics deals with changeable material things but not insofar as\nthey are material, rather, insofar as they are abstracted from motion\n(within the sciences of the quadrivium, where the order is\nastronomy, geometry, harmony, and arithmetic). \nIn chapters 63 and 64, Kilwardby discusses different ways to consider\nthe order of the sciences: (i) the order of discovery, (ii) the\nnatural order, (iii) the ordering according to ends, (iv) the order of\nthe degree of certainty, and (v) the order of teachability. \nAccording to (i), the first among the (arts and) sciences are the\nmechanical arts because they result from the necessity to assist human\nbeings in surpassing their natural physical constraints (DOS 358).\nHuman beings are, in comparison with other animals, weaker in body,\nand therefore tend to devise forms to surpass this deficiency (DOS\n626); but they are gifted (by God) with reason to discover ways to\nsurpass their physical limitations (DOS 360–61). The\nsub-divisions of the mechanical arts obey the principles laid out in\nHugh of St. Victor's Didascalicon—as Kilwardby himself\nmakes explicit (see DOS, chapters 37–39). Special attention must\nbe paid to the similarity between the scheme of the seven liberal arts\nand the seven mechanical arts that Hugh defends and Robert follows\n(DOS 363): as the liberal arts divide into trivium (sciences\nof language) and quadrivium (sciences of things) the\nmechanical arts also divide into a group of three arts concerning\nthose things related to what is external to the body (extrinsecus\ncorporis)—clothing, weaponry (further divided into\narchitecture and industry), and navigation—and a group of four\narts focusing on what is internal to the body (intrinsecus\ncorporis)—agriculture, hunting, medicine, and theatre. \nNext comes speculative philosophy, and here the order is physics,\nmathematics, and metaphysics. This order is established on the basis\nof the proximity of each to the senses, from closest to most distant\n(DOS 627). The end of the speculative sciences is truth (DOS 394),\nthat is, to know the way of natural things according to their natures\n(DOS 405). Then comes ethics (DOS 628), the science that considers the\nhuman operations in connection with the mortal human body (DOS 404),\nfollowed by the sciences of speech/language, which have an order\nthemselves: grammar, rhetoric, and logic. \nKilwardby offers a two-fold consideration of logic, in a stricter and\nin a broader sense. In the broader sense, logic is a science of speech\n(scientia sermocinalis), dealing with correct expression,\nincluding grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic (logic in the strict\nsense). In the stricter sense, logic is the science of reasoning\n(scientia rationalis) (DOS 492). Logic is the science of\nreasoning because it considers and teaches the discovery of terms,\ntheir organization into complex expressions, and the combination of\ncomplex expressions into syllogistic demonstrations; but it is also\nthe science of speech because it deals with the linguistic expression\nof reasoning—which does not remain, as Kilwardby says, hidden\n(inchoate) in the mind (DOS 578): mental words are about things,\nspoken words are about mental words, and written words are about\nspoken words (DOS 593). \nThe sciences of speech divide into those that are significative of\nwhat is known (grammar) and those that are inquisitive about what is\nnot known (logic and rhetoric) (DOS 468). Rhetoric differs from logic\nin that the former is about hypotheses and what is particular, whereas\nthe latter is about theses and what is universal—its subject\nmatter is the syllogism and its species (DOS 468; 471; 474). By\ncontrast, rhetoric, as the science of speaking well, presupposes\ngrammar—the science of signifying correctly (DOS 629). The\nsubject matter of grammar is significative speech qua significative\n(DOS 474), that is, the oratio and its parts insofar as they\nsignify or co-signify (DOS 489). Speech (sermo) here means\nthe human vox as it signifies by convention (ad\nplacitum) (DOS 488). Grammar considers the sentence from the\npoint of view of how well it is formed or its congruity\n(congruitas), which is the result of how its elements are\ncorrectly ordered to one another, rather than of the correspondence of\nthose words with the things they signify (NSLPery I.5). The end\n(finis) is to teach how to correctly express the conceptions\nof the mind (DOS 483–84; 490). Kilwardby's willingness to grant\na scientific role to grammar is notorious (Rosier 1994; Sirridge\n1988). \nNatural order (ii) is the order of the subject matter, that is, the\ndegree of abstraction: first the speculative sciences, then active\nsciences, and finally the sciences of language (DOS 630–635).\n(According to this criterion, the order among the sciences of language\nis: grammar, logic, and rhetoric; this order is found already in the\nprologue of the NSLP). \nThe third type of order (iii) is the order of the end (finis)\nor the ends of the different sciences. Among the sciences, ethics is\nthe first from this point of view, followed by the speculative\nsciences, and then the sciences of language. (According to this\ncriterion, the order among the sciences of language is: logic,\nrhetoric, and grammar.) Speculative knowledge is ordered to ethics in\nthe same way as truth is ordered to the supreme good (DOS 405; see\nCelano 2013, 340). \nThe next criterion (iv) is according to the form or the degree of\ncertainty achieved. According to this, the first among the sciences\nare the speculative – and among them the highest\n(certior) is mathematics (NLP II.34, 512) – followed by\nthe active sciences – and here ethics is prior to mechanics. \nThe final criterion (v) is the order of teachability. According to\nthis ordering, the sciences of language come first—and grammar\nfirst among them—followed by the speculative and active\nsciences—ethics first, then mechanics.  \nTo conclude, Kilwardby's classification includes elements from\nprevious classifications, but the overall result is quite original:\n(i) the inclusion of logic, as a branch of science about human beings,\nwithin the active sciences; (ii) the Aristotelian inspired division\nbetween theoretical or speculative philosophy—which encompasses\nphysics, mathematics, and metaphysics—and practical\nphilosophy—which comprises ethics and divides further into\nmonastic, economic, and political; (iii) the inclusion of the\nmechanical arts (from Hugh of St. Victor) within active or practical\nphilosophy. \nIn 1271, Kilwardby, together with Thomas Aquinas and Albert the Great,\nreceived a questionnaire sent by the Master General of the Dominican\nOrder, John of Vercelli. The questionnaire, constituting 43 questions\nto be answered in a systematic order (forma taxata),\nsurveyed a wide range of theological problems, but the majority (25)\nwas concerned with the movement of the celestial bodies, its causes,\nand the possible influence upon the inferior (terrestrial) bodies. It\nincludes questions such as: Does God move any body immediately; if so,\nby a continuous everlasting movement, by a continuous but not\neverlasting movement, or by an instantaneous motion? (Q1) Are angels\nthe cause of the movement of the celestial bodies? (Q2) \nThe fifth question inquires about the cause of celestial motion.\nKilwardby considers three possible answers that he considers to be\neither (a) philosophically correct, (b) not to be approved either by\nphilosophy or by the saints, or (c) in agreement with philosophy. \nIn Kilwardby's own words: \nKilwardby's theory is, however, not absolutely original, as scholars\n(in particular Weisheipl) have shown. In fact, some sixty years\nearlier, John Blund argued for the same explanation in his\nTractaus de anima (paragraph 10); here he stated that heaven\n(including all celestial spheres) is moved by nature and not by the\nsoul or celestial beings. This view seemed to go unnoticed until\nKilwardby referred to it; originality claims apart, the significance\nof Kilwardby's statement must be emphasized. The interest of his\nsolution is in how it harmonizes a natural explanation for the\nphenomenon of celestial motion – designating the instinct of\ntheir [the celestial bodies'] own weight as its cause – while at\nthe same time it safeguards God's influence in the natural world: God\nis not the direct mover, but the one who endows these bodies with\ntheir instinct (D43Q 2, 14; see Silva 2007 for references). \nOne of the questions Kilwardby addresses in his treatise On\ntime (De tempore)—written most probably after\nDOS—is whether time, as the measure of motion, is defined in\nrelation to the diurnal motion (DT 35), a view identified with\nAverroes. The aim of his treatise is to understand time in such a way\nthat it reveals compatibility between Aristotle's (Physics\nIV, 10–14) definition of time—which Kilwardby calls\n‘physical’—as relative to motion (and motion\nrelative to continuous quantity) and the Augustinian\n(Confessions XI) definition of time—which he calls\n‘metaphysical’—as an extension (distensio)\nof the mind, thus existing only in the mind (DT 10–11).\nKilwardby's solution is to argue for a distinction between\nindeterminate and determinate time: on the one hand, indeterminate\ntime exists outside of and independent from the numbering mind (it is\nneither numbered nor measured) as, prior to any measuring, that which\nis measured is already in motion (DT 77). Determinate time, on the\nother hand, has existence in the mind only, as it can only exist in\nthe measuring mind. In Kilwardby's own words, “time comes into\nexistence when we perceive the direction of that which is earlier and\nlater in motion” (DT 77). Time is, therefore, the measure not of\nany specific motion but the measure of motion (DT 42) defined by an\ninstant before and an instant after. The quantity of motion between\nthese two instants, before and after, has a numerical expression (DT\n34), and this number is then used to measure all other motions (DT\n49): time “measures the whole motion by determining the motion\nwhich will measure the whole” (DT 27). Time is the number of\nmotion because number is the appropriate name for that\n measure.[31]\n We determine time by measuring motion according to fixed measures\n(days, hours, and so on) (DT 77). As the measure for any kind of\nmotion, time has unity. \nTime, hence, is dependent for its definition on motion (NSLP 7, 54).\nThe continuous nature of motion is essential to guarantee the\ncontinuous nature of time (DT 12). Time needs to be continuous for it\nto measure continuous motion (NSLP 8, 58). The continuity of motion,\nin turn, is guaranteed by the continuity of the parts that constitute\nthe moving thing (DT 17). Kilwardby argues that time and motion are\nexceptions to the rule according to which the parts of composite\nthings must exist simultaneously; instead, he claims, that they are\ncomposite transient things, and the parts of time are successive (DT\n7–9). Time has its being from the ordination of its parts into\nbefore and after (NSLP 8, 58). The instant (the now: nunc) is\nfrom the point of view of the substance which is always the same but\ndifferent in the manner of its existence (DT 89). Time is the measure\nof continuous motion, and the instant is the measure of one of the\nmoments of that continuous alteration (DT 94–95). For Kilwardby,\ncelestial motion as measured by time is the standard for measuring all\nother motions (see Trifogli 2013; for other aspects of Kilwardby's\ntreatment of time, namely the connections to his contemporaries, see\nPorro 1996.)","contact.mail":"filpas.mail@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
