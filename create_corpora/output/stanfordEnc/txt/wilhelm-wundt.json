Reserved and shy in\npublic (cf. Kusch 1995: 249, f.), Wundt aggressively dominated his\nchosen arenas, the lecture hall and the pages of books, with a witty\nand sardonic persona (cf., e.g., Wundt 1911a: 61; Boring 1950: 317).\nHis scope was vast, his output incredible. His writings, totaling an\nestimated 53,000 pages, include: articles on animal and human\nphysiology, poisons, vision, spiritualism, hypnotism, history, and\npolitics; text- and handbooks of “medical physics” and\nhuman physiology; encyclopedic tomes on linguistics, logic, ethics,\nreligion, a “system of philosophy;” not to mention his\nmagna opera, the Grundzüge der physiologischen\nPsychologie and the Völkerpsychologie (in ten\n volumes).[2]\n Although his work spans several disciplines—physiology,\npsychology, and philosophy—Wundt would not have considered\nhimself an “interdisciplinary” or\n“pluralistic” thinker: he was to the core a\nfoundationalist, whose great ambition was establishing a\nphilosophico-scientific system of knowledge, practice, and politics\n(see\n Section 7,\n below) (Boring 1950: 327). Despite his intentions, however, the sheer\nlength of his career (some 65 years) and the volume of his output make\nit hard to speak of a coherent Wundtian\n doctrine.[3]\n His corpus is riven by tensions and ambiguities, and though\nhis work has undergone periodic scholarly reconsiderations,\nWundt’s lasting importance for the field of psychology remains\nthe topic of lively debate among\n psychologists.[4]\n\n\nFor philosophers, Wundt is worth studying for two reasons. First, the\narguments he made more than a century ago for the legitimacy of a\nnon-reductionist account of consciousness offer both challenges and\nresources to contemporary psychology and philosophy of mind alike.\nShould those arguments be found lacking, there remains a second,\nperhaps more important reason to read him: not understanding Wundt is\nto tolerate a lacuna at a crucial nexus of the recent history of\nphilosophy. Not only was he a powerful influence (albeit mostly by\nrepulsion) upon the founders of Pragmatism, Phenomenology, and\nneo-Kantianism, it was also Wundt and his pioneering students who\ndeveloped the empirical methodologies that first granted psychology a\ndisciplinary identity distinct from philosophy. It is these\nphilosophically germane aspects of his thought that this article\ndescribes.\n\nWilhelm Maximilian Wundt was born on August 16, 1832, in the German\ntown of Neckarau, outside of Mannheim, the son of a Lutheran minister\n(Titchener 1921b: 161).  The family moved when Wilhelm was six to the\ntown of Heidenheim, in central Baden (Boring 1950: 316). By all\naccounts, he was a precocious, peculiar boy, schooled mainly by his\nfather’s assistant, the vicar, Friedrich Müller; young\nWilhelm was so attached to Müller that he moved in with him when\nthe latter got a post in a neighboring village (Boring 1950:\n316). Wundt studied at the Gymnasien at Bruchsal and\nHeidelberg and entered the University of Tübingen at 19, in 1851\n(Boring 1950: 317). After one year he transferred to the University of\nHeidelberg, where he majored in medicine. By his third year, his\nintense work ethic yielded his first publication (Boring 1950:\n318). Nevertheless, doctoring was not Wundt’s vocation and he\nturned instead to physiology, which he studied for a semester under\nJohannes Müller (the “father of experimental\nphysiology”) at Berlin (Boring 1950: 318). In 1856, at the age\nof 24, Wundt took his doctorate in medicine at Heidelberg, and\nhabilitated as a Dozent in physiology. Two years later, the\nphysicist, physiologist, and psychologist, Hermann von\nHelmholtz[6]\nreceived the call to Heidelberg as a professor of physiology, a\ndecisive moment for Wundt’s career, with Wundt working as\nHelmholtz’s assistant from 1858 until 1865 (Boring 1950: 300,\n319; Araujo 2014: 55). \nWhen Helmholtz moved to Berlin in 1871, Wundt was passed over as\nHelmholtz’s replacement; three years later he took the chair in\n“inductive philosophy” at the University of Zürich.\nHe remained at Zürich for only one year before receiving an\nappointment to “a first-class chair of philosophy at Leipzig in\n1875” (Ben-David and Collins 1966: 462). Leipzig’s\nphilosophy department, dominated by Herbartians, provided the ideal\nenvironment for his intellectual flowering, the soil having been\nprepared by Fechner, Weber, and Lotze (Littman 1979: 74). Wundt became\nfamous at Leipzig. It was here, in 1879, that the university formally\nrecognized his little room of equipment as a bona fide\nlaboratory, the world’s first devoted to\n psychology.[7]\n Students flocked to\n Wundt,[8]\n and while he set the tone and direction of research, it was largely\nthey who constructed apparatus, performed experiments, and published\nresults.  \nEnrollment in his courses doubled about every 15 years, reaching a\npeak of 620 students in the summer of 1912. Wundt ended up sponsoring\n186 Ph.D. dissertations, about a third of which apparently involved\npurely philosophical topics (Tinker, 1932). (Quote—including\nreference to Tinker–from Hearst 1979b: 22) \nThough Wundt participated actively in labor politics in his early\nyears at Heidelberg, even being elected to the Baden parliament, he\nsteadily drifted rightwards, eventually being persuaded by his\n“virulently\n anti-Semitic”[9]\n son, Max, a historian of philosophy, to join the ultranationalist\nDeutsche Philosophische Gesellschaft, after\n 1917.[10]\n It is hard to ignore Wundt’s unattractive\n“application” of his late social and cultural psychology\nto the tendentious critique of Germany’s enemies (Kusch 1995:\n220–1). Nevertheless, his drive and unflagging intellectual\nadvocacy will arouse admiration in some: even at age 80, he remained\ninvolved in academic\n controversy.[11]\n But let us consider the man through his work. \nTo understand Wundt’s philosophical importance one must know\nsomething of his intellectual context. Early nineteenth-century German\npsychology labored under the looming shadow of Kant and his arguments\nthat a science of psychology is in principle impossible. This fact by\nitself illustrates the oddity of the situation, from our point of\nview: why would a psychologist care what a philosopher thought about\nhis practice? The answer is that since ancient times, psychology had\nbeen a basic part of philosophical speculation, though after\nKant’s criticisms many considered it a dying branch, dangerously\nclose to breaking off. Psychologists were philosophers on the\ndefensive (cf. L III: 163). \nPsychology, as a part of philosophy, had already several times changed\nthe way it defined its object: as “soul”, “mental\nsubstance”, “mind”, etc. By the late eighteenth and\nearly nineteenth centuries, many regarded psychology to be the account\nof consciousness or “inner experience”, distinct from the\nnatural scientific accounts of external, sensible reality. After\nhaving dealt the coup de grâce to the speculative,\nrational, a priori psychology of the soul epitomized by\nChristian Wolff, however, Kant tried to cut off any retreat into the\nempirical study of consciousness, as well. In the Metaphysical\nFoundations of Natural Science, he argued that empirical\npsychology cannot be an exact science because the phenomena it seeks\nto explain are not mathematically expressible (Kitcher 1990: 11).\nMoreover, it can never become an experimental science “because\nit is not possible to isolate different thoughts” (Kitcher 1990:\n11). Finally, and most fatally, the only access to the phenomena of\ninner experience, introspection, ipso facto alters those\nphenomena: if I try, by introspection, to study what it’s like\nto be tristful, the phenomena of my sadness are now something\ndifferent, namely, phenomena of my sadness-being-studied-by-me\n(Kitcher 1990: 11). Thus psychologists found their object declared\nbeyond the limit of possible investigation and their methods vain.\nWhile such arguments did not persuade all of Kant’s successors\nof the hopelessness of their enterprise, their attempts were\nunpromising. On the one hand, the German Idealists’ fanciful\nspeculation about Geist collapsed upon itself. On the other\nhand, the efforts of J.F. Herbart to devise a mathematical mental\nmechanics suggested a possible way forward although in the end it\nproved equally fruitless. Thus, for those mid-nineteenth-century\nenthusiasts of mental phenomena, the future of a genuine psychology\nseemed blocked. \nAt the same time, however, progress was being made in human\nphysiology, especially of the sensory systems. In 1834, the\nphysiologist, E.H. Weber, published a startling discovery in his\nDe tactu. His experiments on the sensation of weight had led\nhim to find that there obtains a constant ratio between, on the one\nhand, a given stimulus and, on the other hand, a second stimulus\nsufficiently larger for the difference between the two stimuli to be\njust noticeable, no matter the magnitude of the first\n stimulus.[12]\n In other words, if the first stimulus is of intensity \\(I\\),\nthen \\(\\Delta I\\) is the amount by which it must be increased for\nthe difference to be just noticeable; the ratio of \\(I\\) and\n\\(\\Delta I\\) is constant (\\(k\\)):\n\\(\\Delta I / I = k\\) (cf. L\nIII: 186). This equation, which later came to be known as\nWeber’s\n Law,[13]\n was crucial to the development of psychology because it apparently\ndemonstrated that where Herbart had failed in his aprioristic\nconstruction of mathematical regularities of mind, experimentation\ncould succeed. The situation nevertheless remained murky as\ninterpretations of Weber’s Law multiplied. Fechner, for example,\nelaborated Weber’s experiments but took his results as the basis\nfor an arcane panpsychic monism (Wundt’s own\n“psychological” interpretation is treated in\n Section 4)\n (cf., e.g., Boring 1950: 286). \nIn founding the experimental science of psychology, Wundt, in effect,\nsimply “triangulated” a media via between the\navailable options: he rejected Fechner’s mysticism while\nmaintaining his experimental approach; at the same time, Wundt went\nbeyond the purely physical interpretation of physiological experiments\nà la Helmholtz, arguing that at least in humans experimentation\ncould reveal law-like regularities of inner (psychological)\nreality. Thus, to use the phrase of Ben-David and Collins, he\nestablished the “hybrid science” whose dual provenance is\nexpressed in Wundt’s name for it, “physiological\npsychology” (Ben-David and Collins 1966: 459; Kusch 1995: 122,\n ff.).[14]\n Wundt’s interest, both to scholars of the history of philosophy\nand to contemporary philosophers of mind, flows ultimately from the\ndefinition, methodology, and “metaphysics” of this\nphysiological psychology. Sections\n 3\n and\n 4\n are devoted to a description of its definition, method, and doctrine,\nwhile\n Section 5\n concerns its theoretical underpinnings. The practical and theoretical\nlimits of experimental psychology will be treated in\n Section 6,\n on Völkerpsychologie. \n“The exact description of consciousness [Bewusstsein]\nis the sole aim of experimental psychology” (cited by Titchener\n1921b: 164). Wundt identifies “physiological” with\n“experimental”\n psychology.[15]\n Thus, for Wundt, experimental psychology is the unmediated study of\nconsciousness, aided by the experimental protocols of the\nnatural sciences. Yet this definition involves two contestable\nassumptions: first, that “consciousness” is susceptible to\nexperiment (rejected by Kant); second, that psychology, even if\nconceived as experimental, has for its object consciousness or\n“the mental” (later rejected by the Behaviorists) (cf.\nHearst 1979b: 10). Let us focus on the first assumption, since it is\none Wundt addresses. \nWundt defines consciousness as “inner experience;” it is\nonly the “immediately\n real”[16]\n phenomena constituting this experience, and nothing behind or beyond\nit, that is the object of psychological, as opposed to\nphysiological or psychophysical investigation (PP II: 636).\nWundt’s project is not only a “psychology without a\nsoul”, in F.A. Lange’s phrase, but also a science without\na substrate tout\n court.[17]\n Wundt therefore presents himself as a radical empiricist. The subject\nof psychology “is itself determined wholly and exclusively by\nits predicates”, and these predicates derive solely from direct,\ninternal observation (on which below). The basic domain of inquiry,\naccordingly, is that of “individual psychology” (cf. e.g.\nL III: 160, ff), i.e. of the concrete mental contents\nappearing to particular human beings, and not some mental substance or\nbundle of\n faculties.[18]\n In Wundt’s declaration that individual psychology must become a\nscience via the experimental manipulation of inner phenomena, we see a\npragmatic attitude perhaps peculiar to the working scientist: the\nfuture science as doctrine takes shape in and through the\npresent practice of experimentation, its essays, assays,\ntrials, and errors. Instead of simply submitting to Kant’s\ninjunctions against the very possibility of a scientific psychology,\nWundt finds that certain aspects of our inner experience can be, and\nin fact have been made susceptible to experiment and mathematical\nrepresentation: Weber and Fechner did this. \nNevertheless, Wundt repeatedly addresses the objections raised against\nthe very possibility of psychological, as opposed to physiological or\npsychophysical, experimentation. How are we to subject the mind-body\ncomplex to physiological stimulation such that the reactions may be\ngiven a purely psychological interpretation? From the physiological\npoint of view, experimentation with stimulus and response are not\nexperiments of sensation, but of externally observable excitations and\nreactions of nerve and muscle tissue. For example, a nerve fiber or a\nskin surface may be given an electric shock or brought into contact\nwith acid, and twitches of muscle fiber are observed to follow. It is\nobvious, especially when the nerve-tissue in question belongs to a\ndead frog (Wundt describes such an experiment in PP),\nthat these experiments say nothing about the “inner”\nexperience or consciousness of sensation. Wundt’s innovation is\nthe attempt to project the experimental rigor of physiology into the\ndomain of inner experience by supplementing these experiments with a\npurely psychological set of procedures. These procedures\nconstitute Wundt’s well-known yet misunderstood method of\nSelbstbeobachtung, i.e. “introspection” or,\nbetter, “self-observation”. \nBecause “inner” distinguishes itself from\n“external” experience by virtue of its immediacy, all\npsychology must begin with self-observation, so that physiological\nexperiment is given an ancillary function (Boring 1950: 320–21).\nNow Wundt is well aware of the common criticism that self-observation\nseems inescapably to involve the paradoxical identity (described in\nthe previous section) of the observing subject and observed object.\nIndeed, he takes pains to distinguish his notion of self-observation\nfrom that of “most advocates of the so-called empirical\npsychology”, which he calls “a fount of self-delusions\n[Selbsttäuschungen]”: \nSince in this case the observing subject coincides with the observed\nobject, it is obvious that the direction of attention upon these\nphenomena alters them. Now since our consciousness has less room for\nmany simultaneous activities the more intense these activities are,\nthe alteration in question as a rule consists in this: the phenomena\nthat one wishes to observe are altogether suppressed [i.e., by the\nactivity of focused attention upon them]. (L III: 162)  \nWundt believes that one can experimentally correct for this problem by\n \nusing, as much as possible, unexpected processes, processes not\nintentionally adduced, but rather such as involuntarily present\nthemselves [sich darbieten]. (L III:\n 162)[19] \nIn other words, it is in the controlled conditions of a laboratory\nthat one can, by means of experimenter, experimental subject, and\nvarious apparatus, arbitrarily and repeatedly call forth precisely\npredetermined phenomena of consciousness. The psychologist is\nnot then interested in the psychophysical connections between\nthe somatic or nervous sense-mechanisms and the elicited\n“inner” phenomena, but solely in describing, “and\nwhere possible measuring”, the psychological\nregularities that such experiments can reveal, viz., regular causal\nlinks within the domain of the psychic alone (L III: 165).\nAccording to Wundt, psychological experiments thus conceived\naccomplish in the realm of consciousness precisely what\nnatural-scientific experiments do in nature: they do not leave\nconsciousness to itself, but force it to answer the\nexperimenter’s questions, by placing it under regulated\nconditions. Only in this way is  \na [psychological] observation [as opposed to a mere\nperception {Wahrnehmung}] at all possible in the scientific\nsense, i.e., the attentive, regulated pursuit of the phenomena.\n(L III:\n 165)[20] \nA detailed account of these experiments themselves, however, lies far\nbeyond the scope of this\n article.[21] \nWundt, like most early experimental\n psychologists,[22]\n concentrated his investigations upon sensation and perception; of all\npsychic phenomena, sensation is the most obviously connected to the\nbody and the physical world (Hearst 1979b: 33). For Wundt, sensations\nand our somatic sensory apparatus are especially important for the\nproject of physiological psychology for the simple reason that\nsensations are the “contact points” between the physical\nand the psychological (PP I: 1). Sensations\n(Empfindungen), as the medium between the physical and\npsychic, are uniquely susceptible to a double-sided\n inquiry,[23]\n viz. from the “external” physical side of stimulus, and\nthe “internal” psychological side of corresponding mental\nrepresentation\n (Vorstellung).[24]\n The Wundtian psychologist therefore controls the external,\nphysiological side experimentally, in order to generate diverse\ninternal representations that only can “appear” to the\nintrospective observer. According to Wundt, the representations\n(Vorstellungen) that constitute the contents\n(Inhalt) of consciousness all have their elemental basis in\nsensations (Empfindungen) (PP I:\n 281).[25]\n Sensations are never given to us as elemental, however; we never\napperceive them “purely”, but always already\n“combined” (verbunden) in the representation of a\nsynthesized perception (PP I: 281). Yet, the manifestly\ncomposite nature of our representations forces us to abstract such\nelementary components (PP I: 281) (cf. PP II: 256).\nPure sensations, according to Wundt, display three differentiae:\nquality, intensity, and “feeling-tone”\n(Gefühlston) (PP I:\n 282–3).[26] \nHis treatment of quality and intensity are especially important for\ngetting a clearer notion of his notion of psychological\nexperimentation. It is a “fact of inner experience” that\n“every sensation possesses a certain intensity with respect to\nwhich it may be compared to other sensations, especially those of\nsimilar quality” (PP I: 332). The outer sensory stimuli\nmay be measured by physical methods, whereas psychology is\ngiven the corresponding  \ntask of determining to what degree our immediate estimation\n[Schätzung] [of the strength of sensory stimuli] that we\nmake aided by our sensations—to what degree this estimation\ncorresponds to or deviates from the stimuli’s real\nstrength. (PP I: 332–3)  \nThere are two possible tasks for psychophysical measurement of\nsense-stimuli: the “determination of limit-values between which\nstimulus-changes are accompanied by changes in sensation;” and\n“the investigation of the lawful relations between\nstimulus-change and change in sensation” (PP I: 333).\nSensation can thus be measured with respect to changes in intensity\ncorresponding to changes in strength of stimuli (PP\nI: 335–6). \nWeber’s Law (WL) is the most striking example of such a\nrelation, and Wundt’s interpretation of WL sheds much light on\nwhat he means by “physiological psychology”. Wundt\nwrites: \nWe can formulate [this law] as follows: A difference between any two\nstimuli is estimated [geschätzt] to be equal if the\nrelationship between the stimuli is equal. Or: If in our apprehension\n[Auffassung] the intensity of the sensation is to increase by\nequal amounts, then the relative stimulus-increase must remain\nconstant. This latter statement may also be expressed as follows: The\nstrength of a stimulus must increase geometrically if the strength of\nthe apperceived sensation is to increase arithmetically. (PP\nI: 359)  \nNow these various\n formulations[27]\n of WL admit, as Wundt says, of three different, and indeed\nincompatible interpretations; that is, there are three different\nconceptions of what WL is a law of. First, the physiological\ninterpretation takes it as a manifestation of the “peculiar laws\nof excitation of the neural\n matter;”[28]\n second, the psychophysical (Fechnerian) interpretation takes WL as\ngoverning the interrelation between somatic and psychic activity\n(PP I: 392). Wundt rejects both of these in favor of a third,\nthe psychological interpretation; his arguments are instructive.\nAgainst the physiological interpretation Wundt raises the following\nmain point, viz. that \nthe estimation of the intensity of sensation\n(Empfindungsintensität) is a complicated process, upon\nwhich—in addition to the central sensory excitation—the\neffectiveness of the center of apperception will exert considerable\ninfluence. We can obviously say nothing immediate about how\nthe central sense-excitations would be sensed independently of the\nlatter; thus Weber’s Law, too, concerns only\napperceived sensations, and therefore can just as well have\nits basis in the processes of the apperceptive comparison of sensation\nas in the original constitution of the central sensory excitations.\n(PP I: 391–2)  \nNow apperception (see below) is a purely psychological act in\nconsciousness—and it is solely as a law of the psychological\nprocesses involved in the “measuring comparison of\nsensations” that Wundt understands WL (PP I: 393). In\nother words, WL  \ndoes not apply to sensations in and for themselves, but to processes\nof apperception, without which a quantitative estimation of sensations\ncould never take place. (PP I: 393; cf. PP II: 269)\n \nWundt sees WL as simply a mathematical description of the more general\nexperience that  \nwe possess in our consciousness no absolute, but merely a relative\nmeasure of the intensity of the conditions [Zustände]\nobtaining in it, and that we therefore measure in each case one\ncondition against another, with which we are obliged in the first\nplace to compare it. (PP I: 393)  \nFor this reason Wundt’s “psychological\ninterpretation” makes WL into a special case of a more general\nlaw of consciousness, viz. “of the relation or\nrelativity of our inner conditions\n[Zustände]” (PP I: 393). WL is therefore\nnot a law of sensation so much as of apperception. \nThis solution typifies Wundt’s general view that the domains of\npsychic and physical phenomena do not stand in conflict, but rather\nconstitute separate spheres of (causal) explanation. His\ninterpretation of WL nicely illustrates how, on his view,\nphysiological experiments can yield mathematically expressible\nresults, not about the physical, somatic processes involved in\nsensation, but about the relationships among these sensations as\napperceived, i.e., as psychological elements and objects\nof consciousness. He writes that “the psychological\ninterpretation offers the advantage of not excluding a simultaneous\n[i.e. parallel] physiological explanation” (presumably once the\nneurophysiological facts of the matter have been better elucidated\n— cf. PP I: 391); by contrast, the two competing\ninterpretations “only permit a one-sided explanation” of\nWL (PP I: 393). \nPsychology finds consciousness to be constituted of three major\nact-categories: representation, willing, and feeling; our discussion\nis limited to the first two. Now while Wundt is forced to speak of\nrepresentations and representational acts as distinct, he is\nnevertheless clear that they are merely different aspects of a single\nflowing process. This is his so-called theory of actuality\n(Aktualitätstheorie) (1911a: 145). Representations are\nrepresentational acts, never the “objects with constant\nproperties” propounded by adherents of a so-called theory of\nsubstantiality (Substantialitätstheorie) (1911a: 145).\nThis identity of representation and representational act typifies what\nwe may call Wundt’s “monistic\n perspectivism”.[29]\n Everywhere he insists that the “psychic processes form a\nunitary flow of events [einheitliches\n Geschehen[30]\n ]”, the constituents of which—“representing,\nfeeling, willing, etc”.—are “only differentiated\nthrough psychological analysis and abstraction” (1911a: 145).\nKeeping in mind the underlying active unity of the psychic, let us\nexamine some of Wundt’s “analyses and\nabstractions”. \nAs discussed in the previous section, all consciousness originates in\nsensations. These, however, are never given to consciousness in a\n“pure” state as individual sensory atoms, but are always\nperceived as already\n compounded[31]\n into representations (Vorstellungen), that is, into\n“images of an object or of a process in the external\nworld” (PP II: 3; 1). Representations may be either\nperceptions (Wahrnehmungen) or intuitions\n(Anschauungen): the same representation is called a\n“perception” if considered as the presentation of\nobjective reality, and an “intuition” if considered in\nterms of the accompanying conscious, subjective activity (PP\nII: 1). If the representation’s object is not real (cf.\nPP II: 479) but merely thought, then it is a so-called\nreproduced\n representation.[32] \nNow the formative process, by which sensations are connected\ninto representations either through temporal sequencing or spatial\nordering (PP II: 3), constitutes a main aspect of the\nactivity we call consciousness; the other is the “coming and\ngoing of [these] representations” (PP II: 256). On the\nevidence of “innumerable psychological\n facts”,[33]\n Wundt claims that all representations are formed through\n“psychological synthesis of sensations”, and that this\nsynthesis accompanies every representational act (PP II:\n256). We are therefore entitled to take the act of representational\nsynthesis as a “characteristic feature of consciousness\nitself” (PP II: 256). Although consciousness consists\nin the formation of representations, on the one hand, and of the\ncoming and going of such representations, on the other\nhand—i.e., although its contents are a continuous streaming of\nfusing and diffusing representations—yet it is not merely this\n(PP II: 256). We are also aware within our consciousness of\nanother activity operating upon our representations, namely of paying\nthem attention (PP II: 266). \nAttention may be understood in terms of the differing degrees to which\nrepresentations are present (gegenwärtig) in\nconsciousness. These varying degrees of presence correspond to the\nvarying degrees to which consciousness is “turned towards\n[zugewandt]” them (PP II: 267). Wundt appeals\nto an analogy: \nThis feature of consciousness can be clarified by that common image we\nuse in calling consciousness an inner vision. If we say that the\nrepresentations present [gegenwärtig] at a particular\nmoment are in consciousness’s field of vision\n[Blickfeld], then that part of the field upon which our\nattention is turned may be called the inner focal point of vision\n[Blickpunkt]. The entry of a representation into the field of\ninner vision we call “perception”, and its entry into the\nfocal point of vision we call “apperception”. (PP\nII: 267)  \nThus consciousness is a function of the scope of attention, which may\nbe broader (as perception) or narrower (as\n apperception[34]\n ). Apperception, in turn, may either actively select and focus upon a\nperceived representation, or it may passively find certain\nrepresentations suddenly thrusting themselves into the center of\nattention (PP II: 267; 562). There is no distinct boundary\nbetween the perceived and the apperceived, and Wundt’s analogy\nmay be misleading (cf. esp. PP II: 268) to the extent that it\ngives the impression of two separable forms of attention able in\nprinciple to subsist together simultaneously (that is, apperception\nfocusing upon a point in the perceptual field while that field\ncontinues to be perceived). No: perceptive attention becomes\napperceptive attention just as it focuses more strenuously,\nconstricting the perceptive field. The more it contracts, the\n“brighter” the representation appears, now becoming the\nfocal point of apperception as the fringes of the perceptual field\nretreat into “darkness” (PP II: 268). For Wundt,\nthe distinguishing feature of the apperceptive focus is that it\n“always forms a unitary representation”, so that a\nnarrower focal point (or rather, the focal “field”\n(PP II: 268; 477)) results in a correspondingly higher\nintensity of attention (PP II: 269). Hence  \nthe degree of apperception is not to be measured according to the\nstrength of the external impression [i.e. physically or\nphysiologically], but solely according to the subjective activity\nthrough which consciousness turns to a particular sense-stimulus.\n(PP II: 269) \nThus,\n apperception[35]\n is closely akin to the will, indeed is a primordial expression of\nwill: “the act of apperception in every case consists in an\ninner act of will [Willenshandlung]” (L I:\n34). By contrast, Wundt argues that the processes by which the\nrepresentations are themselves formed, fused, synthesized, and\n“delivered” into the perceptual field, are associative\nprocesses “independent of apperception” (PP II:\n278–9; 437, ff). Passive apperception may be characterized\nsimply by saying that here the associative form of representational\nconnection is predominant (cf. L I: 34), whereas when\n“the active apperception successively raises representations\ninto the focal field of consciousness”, this active\npassage of representations obeys the special laws of what Wundt calls\n“apperceptive connection” (PP II: 279). He does\nnot consider the types of association to be genuine psychological\nlaws, i.e. laws governing the “succession of\nrepresentations”, because they merely generate the\npossible kinds of representational compounds. It is\napperception, in accordance with its own laws, that\n“decides” which of these possible connections are realized\nin consciousness (L I: 34). We see here the important role\nplayed by his so-called\n voluntarism:[36]\n associationist psychologists, according to Wundt, cannot give an\naccount of the (subjective) activity that immediately\ncharacterizes consciousness (cf. Wundt 1911b: 721, ff.; \nLipps 1903: 202, ff.; cf. esp. L I: 33).\n Yet this is not to deny association of sensations altogether. Rather,\nit is to conceive of association as merely a subliminal process, the\nproducts of which, representations, then become the actual objects of\nconsciousness. Thus the “apperceptive connections of\nrepresentations presuppose the various types of association”,\nespecially the associative\n fusion[37]\n of sensations into\n representations.[38] \nApperception operates according to its own peculiar laws (PP\nII: 470). These laws, like those of association, govern acts of\ncombination (Verbindung) and separation (Zerlegung).\nHow do apperceptive laws differ from those of association? Wundt\nwrites: \nAssociation everywhere gives the first impetus to [apperceptive]\ncombinations. Through association we combine, e.g., the\nrepresentations of a tower and of a\n church.[39]\n But no matter how familiar the coexistence of these representations\nmay be, mere association does not help us form the representation of a\nchurch-tower. For this latter representation does not contain the two\nconstitutive representations in a merely external coexistence; rather,\nin the [representation of the church-tower], the representation of the\nchurch has come to adhere [anhaften] to the representation of\nthe tower, more closely determining the latter. In this way, the\nagglutination of representations forms the first level of\napperceptive combination. (PP II: 476; on\n“agglutination of representations”, see also L I:\n38, f.)  \nIt is on the basis of such “agglutinative”\nrepresentations, exhibiting essentially different characteristics than\ntheir constituents, that apperception continues to synthesize ever\nmore representations, a process resulting in their compression\n(Verdichtung) or displacement (Verschiebung)\n(PP II: 476–7; cf. L I: 43). The more the\noriginal associative or agglutinated representations are compressed or\ndisplaced, the more they disappear altogether from consciousness,\nleaving in their stead a single representation whose original\ncomposite structure has disappeared. This process, which Wundt calls\n“representational synthesis” proper, is reiterated at ever\nhigher levels until even the sensory foundation vanishes, as in the\ncase of abstract and symbolic concepts (L I: 39). \nApperception is not only a synthetic process; it is also governed by\nrules of separation. Apperceptive separation operates only upon the\nrepresentations already synthesized out of the “associative\nstock [Assoziationsvorrath]”, but does not necessarily\ndecompose them into their original parts (PP II: 478).\nWundt’s notion of apperceptive separation is one of the most\nphilosophically original, consequential, and ambiguous of his\ntheories. He argues that it is usually the case that \nthe original representational totality [ursprüngliche\nGesammtvorstellung] is present to our consciousness at first as\nan indistinct complex of individual representations. These individual\nparts and the manner of their connection become distinct only through\nthe separative activity of apperception. (PP II: 478)  \nThus, conscious thought and judgment (On judgment, see SP I:\n34, ff., esp. 37, ff.) (separating and combining subject and\npredicate) is not, as may seem at first blush, an act of  \ngathering together [representational] components and then fitting them\ntogether in the successive articulation of the total representation\n[Gesammtvorstellung]. (PP II: 478)  \nRather, “the whole, albeit in an indistinct form, must have been\napperceived prior to its parts” (PP II: 478). Only in\nthis way can one explain the \nwell-known fact that we can easily and without trouble finish\n[composing] a complicated sentence-structure. This would be impossible\nif the whole had not been represented at the outset. The\naccomplishment of the judgment-function therefore consists, from the\npsychological point of view, only in our successively making the\nobscure outlines of the total picture [Gesammtbild], so that\nat the end of the composite thought-act the whole, too, stands more\nclearly before our consciousness. (PP II: 478)  \nBecause according to Wundt’s principle of “actuality\n[Aktualität]” consciousness is purely an activity,\nit is impossible to render his theory in terms of\n“structures”. It consists in constantly interacting\nprocesses: on the one hand, there are associative processes\nthat fuse sensations into elemental representations. These stream into\nand thereby constitute a fluctuating field of attention:\nflowing and broad, it is called “perception;” ebbing and\nconcentrate, “apperception”. As an activity attention is\nan expression of will; since consciousness just is attention in its\nshifting forms, it is the activity of will manifested in the\nselection, combination, and separation of disposable representations\n(PP II: 564). These representations are constantly\n“worked over” by apperception, which through its synthetic\nand diaeretic activity constructs them into ever “higher\ndevelopmental forms of consciousness”, such that in the end\ntheir origins in sensation and perception might be completely erased.\nIn other words, as the apperceptive activity becomes increasingly\nintense it seems as it were to rise above the field of perception,\nabove the field of its own constructs, becoming aware of itself as\npure activity, as pure self-consciousness:  \nrooted in the constant activity [Wirksamkeit] of\napperception, [self-consciousness] … retreats completely into\napperception alone, so that, after the completion of the development\nof consciousness, the will appears as the only content of\nself-consciousness…. (PP II:\n 564)[40] \nThus the self as will appears to itself as independent from and\nopposed to an external world of both sensation and culture, though\nWundt hastens to add that this is but an illusion; in reality,\n“the abstract self-consciousness maintains constantly the full\nsensible background of the empirical self-consciousness”\n(PP II:\n 564).[41] \nAs we have seen\n (Section 3.2),\n for Wundt the possibility of a physiological psychology (as\nopposed to a purely physiological inquiry into sensation, behavior,\nlearning, etc.) depends on the possibility of self-observation.\nSelf-observation, in turn, is of scientific use only if the sequence\nof “inner” phenomena of consciousness is assumed to fall\nunder an independent principle of psychic causality. For if it does\nnot, then these phenomena could never be more than a chaotic muddle,\nof which there could be no science. Alternatively, if the\n“inner” phenomena could be shown to fall under the\nphysical causality of the natural sciences, then there would be no\nneed for a special psychological method, such as self-observation (cf.\nNatorp 1912). In fact, however, a system of psychic causality can be\ndetermined, Wundt argues, one that at no point is reducible to\nphysical causality: “no connection of physical processes can\never teach us anything about the manner of connection between\npsychological elements” (Wundt 1894: 43, quoted in Kusch 1995:\n134). This “fact”, which Wundt thinks is given in the\npsycho-physiological experiments described above, leads him to his\nso-called principle of psychophysical parallelism (PPP). \nThe PPP has caused a great deal of confusion in the secondary\nliterature, which persists in characterizing it as a\n metaphysical[42]\n doctrine somehow derived from Leibniz (e.g., Wellek 1967: 350;\nThompson and Robinson 1979: 412) or Spinoza (cf. L I: 77).\nWundt however is crystal-clear that the PPP is not a metaphysical\n“hypothesis”. It is merely an admittedly misleading name\nfor an “empirical postulate” necessary to explain the\nphenomenal “fact” of consciousness of which we are\nimmediately aware (Wundt 1911a: 22; cf. esp. 28). By denying any\nmetaphysical interpretation of his principle, Wundt insists that the\n“physical” and the “psychic” do not name two\nontologically distinct realms whose events unfold on separate yet\nparallel causal tracks. He is therefore not an epiphenomenalist, as\nsome commentators have claimed. Rather, the “physical” and\n“psychic” name two mutually irreducible perspectives from\nwhich one and the same world or Being (Sein) may be observed:\n“nothing occurs in our consciousness that does not find its\nsensible foundation in certain physical processes”, he writes,\nand all psychological acts (association, apperception,\nwilling) “are accompanied by physiological nerve-actions”\n(PP II: 644). In distinguishing the empirical from the\nmetaphysical PPP, Wundt contrasts his own view against\nSpinoza’s, which, according to Wundt, makes the realm of\nmaterial substance exist separately from, though parallel to that of\nmental substance (Wundt 1911a: 22, 44–5; cf. esp. Wundt 1911a:\n143, ff.). \nThe investigator of psychological phenomena, therefore, must assume,\nsolely for heuristic reasons, two “parallel” and\nirreducible causal chains by which two distinct types of phenomena may\nbe accounted for (Wundt 1911a: 143; cf. Van Rappard 1979: 109). Wundt\ncompares the distinction between psychological and physiological\nexplanation to the different viewpoints taken by chemistry and physics\nof the same object, a crystal. The chemical and physical accounts are\nnot of two different entities; rather, they describe and explain the\nsame entity from two distinct points of view, and in this sense the\ntwo accounts are “parallel”. Similarly, (neuro-)\nphysiology and psychology do not describe different processes, one\nneural and one mental, but the same process seen from the outside and\nthe inside, respectively. As Wundt writes,  \n“inner” and “outer” experience merely\ndesignate distinct perspectives that we can apply in our\ngrasp and scientific investigation of what is, in itself, a unitary\nexperience. (Wundt 1896a; quoted at Natorp 1912: 264). \nWhereas experimental psychology focuses in the first place on the\neffects of the physical (outer) upon the psychic (inner), the willing\nconsciousness is characterized by intervening in the external world,\nthat is, by expressing the internal (PP I:\n2). This latter feature of consciousness lies beyond the scope of\nexperiment, because the origins of conscious expression cannot be\ncontrolled. Moreover, psychological development is obviously not\ndetermined merely by sensation, but also by the meaningful influences\nof the individual’s “spiritual [geistig]\nenvironment”—his culture—influences again not\nobviously susceptible to\n experimentation.[43]\n Hence, just as Wundt reserved for physiology an ancillary role in\nexperimental psychology, so too he now argues for the utility of a\ndistinct methodological approach to analyze and explain the  \npsychic processes that are bound, in virtue of their genetic and\ndevelopmental conditions, to spiritual communities [geistige\nGemeinschaften]. (L III: 224)  \nIt is the inquiry into “cultural products\n[Erzeugnisse]” of the “totality of spiritual life\n[geistiges Gesammtleben] in which certain psychological laws\nhave embodied themselves”, specifically, language, art, myth,\nand customs (Sitten) (PP I: 5; L III: 230).\nThese objects cannot be investigated in the same way as those of\nindividual “inner” experience, but require a mode of\nexplanation appropriate to their external, yet non-physical\nphenomenology. This inquiry, which complements and together with\nexperimental psychology completes the discipline of psychology, Wundt\ncalls “Völkerpsychologie” (hereafter\nabbreviated: VP) (L III:\n 225).[44] \nWhile Wundt had already discussed the role of a VP necessary\nfor the completion of psychology in his early writings, it was not\nuntil old age that he committed himself to its realization. The result\nwas his ten-volume work, entitled Völkerpsychologie.\nWhile an examination of the contents of these tomes lies beyond the\nscope of this article, his justification and clarification of the\nvölkerpsychologisch project as such are of interest for\nthose interested in truth and method in the social and human sciences.\nWundt stresses that although VP shares object-domains with\nsuch sciences as history, philology,\n linguistics,[45]\n ethnology,[46] or anthropology (L III:\n226), yet it is only interested in these domains insofar as they\n“are determined by general psychological laws, and not just by\nhistorical conditions” (PP I: 5). In other words,\nVP is not interested in the unique and specific facts of this\nnation’s history or that tribe’s language as such, but\nonly insofar as these reveal “the general psychological\ndevelopments that arise from the connection of individual\n[developments]” (L III: 226). This quotation is\nimportant. While VP does not concern itself with historical\nor linguistic facts as such, this does not mean that it is not\nconcerned with individuality. Indeed, it is through the study of the\npsychological motives only apparent in history or language—i.e.,\nin communal existence—that our understanding of the\nindividual is completed (cf. L III: 224, 228). This\nview is typical of Wundt’s perspectivism. Just as psychology is\nan alternative perspective to that of physiology, so too\n(within psychology) VP provides an alternative\nperspective to that of experimental psychology. Wundt considers none\nof these various perspectives dispensable, since each one is a\ncomplement necessary for total science. But while each of these\nperspectives reveals a (phenomenologically) irreducible\n(“parallel”) network of causal chains, the\nprocess so explained, Wundt holds, is in every case one and\nthe same. There is just one empirical world and reality, but\nmany irreducible varieties of experience. Thus, in the case of\nVP, too, he claims that there is no “general law of\nspiritual events [geistiges Geschehen] that is not already\ncompletely contained in the laws of the individual\nconsciousness” (L III: 225). \nAs we have seen, Wundt was concerned not only with expanding the set\nof known psychological facts, but also with interpreting them within\nan appropriate explanatory framework. Of course, the necessity of\nestablishing such a closed framework distinct from physiology amounted\nto distinguishing psychological causality from physical causality in\ngeneral, and hence psychology from the natural sciences altogether.\nBut psychology has to be defined against two other areas of\n“scientific” (wissenschaftlich) inquiry; first,\nin its völkerpsychologisch dimension, against the\nGeisteswissenschaften or “human sciences”, and\nsecond, against the non-psychological domains of philosophy. As these\nrelationships are laid out below, it must always be remembered that\nalthough these four areas—psychology, philosophy, natural\nscience, human science—are irreducible, this irreducibility is\nnot a metaphysical or ontological one, but merely one of\nexplanatory function (and commensurate methodology). They do\nnot have distinct objects, but again merely represent ways of\ndescribing irreducible perspectives upon the same object, namely\nexperience. Wundt writes: \nObjects of science do not in and of themselves yield starting points\nfor a classification of the sciences. Rather, it is only regarding the\nconcepts that these objects call for that we can undertake\nthis classification. Therefore, the same object [Gegenstand]\ncan become the object [Objekt] of several sciences: geometry,\nepistemology, and psychology each deals with space, but space is\napproached in each discipline from a different angle. … The\ntasks of the sciences are therefore never determined by the objects in\nthemselves, but are predominantly dependent upon the logical points of\nview from which they are considered. (SP I: 12–3; cf. L III: 228)\n \nWundt’s monism has serious consequences for the sort of claim\nphilosophy (and thus psychology) can make to be scientific. The most\nobvious is that neither can lay claim to synthetic knowledge that is\nnot founded or (also) describable in terms of the natural or human\nsciences. \nFor Wundt, it is only the sciences that have methodologies by which to\nsynthesize our representations, sensible as well as\n“processed”, into “facts” or “pieces\nof” knowledge (Erkenntnisse). Hence, while strictly\nspeaking he is committed to considering psychology (i.e.,\nphysiological psychology and VP) a part of philosophy, he\nusually speaks of them as distinct enterprises. This is because\npsychology is hybrid, adapting scientific methodologies to\nits particular aims; in this sense psychology, although part of\nphilosophy, synthesizes facts, just like the\n sciences.[47]\n By contrast, philosophy’s pure task is universal,\noperating over all scientific domains; it is, he writes,\n“the general science whose task it is to unify the general\npieces of knowledge yielded by the particular sciences into a system\nfree of contradiction” (SP I: 9). Philosophy’s\npositive role, therefore, is not to provide the foundations of\nscience, nor can it ever “step into the role of a particular\nscience” (cf. Kusch 1995: 129); rather\nit is “to take in every case the already secured results of\nthose sciences as its foundation”, and organize them\ninto a single, overarching system by determining their points of\nconnection (PP I: 8; 6). Wundt calls this side of philosophy\nPrinzipienlehre or “doctrine of principles”. By\ncontrast, its negative or critical role is to regulate the sciences in\naccord with the imperative of consistent systematicity. In short, it\nhas no constitutive but merely a regulative role\nvis-à-vis the sciences. Thus, when we return to the\nphilosophical as opposed to the scientific aspect of\npsychology’s hybrid structure, we see that this aspect consists\nin its aim (as opposed to its method) of explaining rules of genesis,\nconnection, and separation of those mental representations with an\nepistemic character. Wundt calls this psychological contribution to\nphilosophy Erkenntnislehre or “doctrine of\nknowledge” (i.e., the theory of the coming-to-be of knowledge).\nThis explanation then provides to philosophy the scientific foundation\nfor its pure\n task.[48] \nWundt divides up the sciences into two large families, the\n“formal” sciences and the “real” sciences. The\nformer include mathematics; the latter study the natural and spiritual\naspects of\n reality,[49]\n and correspondingly are divided into the natural and the human\nsciences. The human sciences in turn are divided into two genera, one\nof which deals with spiritual processes (geistige\nVorgänge), the other with spiritual products (geistige\nErzeugnisse). The former just is the science of psychology; the\nlatter includes the general study of these products as such (e.g.,\nphilology, political science, law, religion, etc.), as well as the\nparallel historical study of these products as they have in\nfact been created (This taxonomy is given in SP I:\n19–20). Since the process precedes the product (cf. Kusch 1995:\n132), psychology as “the doctrine of spiritual\n[geistig] processes as such” is the foundation of all\nthe other human sciences (SP I:\n 20).[50]\n Philosophy, in turn, takes psychology’s results and\nagain abstracts from them the normative rules governing the\norganization of the human and natural sciences, something the\nlatter cannot do themselves. In this way psychology as a science\nmediates between the sciences and philosophy. \nOne aspect of Wundt’s hierarchy of method and knowledge deserves\nspecial attention, namely the place of logic in the sciences. Like\nalmost all the similarly titled tomes produced by the German\nmandarins, Wundt’s Logik (in two, later three 600-page\nvolumes in four editions) molders away in research libraries. Its\ncontents are for the most part unrecognizable as “logic”\nin any contemporary sense. What most philosophers meant by\n“Logik” in Wundt’s day was the rules and\nprocedure of inference governing the sciences, where this often\nincluded lengthy treatments of the actual scientific application of\nthese rules. What we would expect to find in a book called\n“Logik” today, viz., symbolic or mathematical\nlogic, was called in Wundt’s day\n“Logistik”, and was considered by some a\nmathematical (that is, merely formal) game unworthy of\nphilosophy’s scientific (that is, substantive) role\n(cf., e.g., Natorp 1910: 4–10). Thus we should not be surprised\nto read Wundt, too, declare logic’s task to be the justifying\nand accounting for “those laws of thinking active in scientific\nknowledge” (L I: 1). \nFor Wundt, however, this task involves psychology, and indeed much of\nhis Logik is devoted to this topic. As he reasonably points\nout, logic comprises the rules of correct thinking, and the principles\nof logic are known to us as conscious representations (L I:\n76; 13; cf. Wundt 1920: 267); thinking and consciousness are objects\nof psychological inquiry; therefore any account of logic must include\na psychological description of the genesis of logical principles\n(L I: 13). Even the normative character of logic had, in his\nview, to be given a psychological interpretation (cf. L I:\n76). Inevitably Wundt was accused of logical\npsychologism—the all-purpose term of abuse flung about\nin fin-de-siècle German philosophical debate. Husserl, for\nexample, condemned him for expounding an “extreme” form of\npsychologism (Husserl 1901: 124–5; cf. Farber 1943: 123, 208,\nff.; cf. Wundt 1910b: 511, ff.), viz.\n“species-relativism”, the notion that “truth varies\nwith different species” of animal (Kusch 1995: 49). Yet Wundt\nhimself calls his Logik the “most rigorous rejection of\nthe psychologism that reigned at the time [i.e., 1880]” (Wundt\n1920: 264), and held that “logical thinking is universally\nbinding for every thinker” (Wundt 1920: 266). How can we\nreconcile these statements? \nWundt’s view of logic is unusual, but fully in line with his\nrigorously anti-metaphysical monistic perspectivism. That is, there is\nno logical “third realm”, but merely a single process\ncalled “thinking [Denken]” (L I: 6); it\nis an immediately given fact of thinking that there are logical laws\nthat stand over against all our other thoughts and representations as\nnorms (L I: 76). Their psychological immediacy does not,\nWundt thinks, compromise their normativity, since what is given in\nconsciousness precisely is their normative\n character.[51]\n Once this character is taken for granted, the science of logic\ndevelops its systems of correct deductions (Schliessen)\nwithout further worry about the source of that normativity. All that\nremains is “develop[ing] the foundations and methods of\nscientific knowledge” (L I: 8). \nAccording to Wundt, the three features of logical thinking that set it\napart from all other types of representational connection are its\n“spontaneity, evidence, and universal validity\n[Spontaneität, Evidenz, Allgemeingültigkeit]”\n(L I: 76). Let us briefly describe these. Wundt’s\nnotion of the spontaneity of logical thinking is perhaps the most\npsychologistic-sounding of the three. Because, as was described above,\nthinking is  \nexperienced immediately as an inner activity, … we must regard\nit as an act of will [Willenshandlung], and accordingly\nregard the logical laws of thought [Denkgesetze] as laws of\nthe will. (L I: 76–7)  \nIn other words, logical thinking is accompanied essentially by a\nfeeling of the thinking subject’s freedom in thinking. But while\nlogical thinking may be accompanied by an especially strong\nself-awareness of the mind’s own activity, this feeling is not\nunique to logical thinking, since active apperception more generally\nis also accompanied by the sense of subjective activity. By contrast,\nlogical evidence and universal validity are characteristics possessed\nby logical thinking “to a higher degree than by any other\npsychic function” (L I: 78). By “evidence”,\nWundt means the character of compelling necessity accompanying a\nlogical judgment, what we might call self-evidence (L I: 78,\n79). A thought [Gedanke] may exhibit immediate certainty,\nobvious without any mediating thought-acts; or a thought may be\nmediately certain, grounded in prior thought-acts. Immediate and\nmediate evidence have their source and foundation in intuition\n(Anschauung): immediate evidence immediately, mediate\nevidence mediately (L I: 82–3). Intuition is not\nidentical with evidence, for evidence only  \ncomes to be at the moment when logical thinking relates the contents\nof intuition and presupposes the relations of such intuitive contents\nas objectively given. (L I: 83)  \nWundt thus charts a middle course between, on the one hand, making\nlogical evidence a “transcendent or transcendental”\nfunction of thinking (as Kant and “recent speculative\nphilosophy” is alleged to do), and, on the other hand,\nconsidering it an “empirical trait of sensible objects”\n(as do empiricists and positivists) (L I: 83). \nBy the standards of such philosophers as Husserl, Natorp, and Frege,\nWundt appears committed to a logical psychologism. But it is worth\nconsidering his response to this charge, for it again illustrates his\nmonistic perspectivism. While he rejects any interpretation of the\norigin of logical principles that would impugn their normative\ncharacter of necessity, he also rejects the opposite extreme, what he\ncalls “Logizismus”—the complete divorce of\nlogical thinking from thinking as it actually occurs in minds. For\nWundt, the logicist makes a metaphysical leap as suspect as it is\nunnecessary in conjuring up a “pure”,\n“absolute”, “transcendental”, but in any case\nseparate source of logical normativity (cf. Wundt 1910b:\n515). Instead of solving the puzzle of logical normativity, he\nexacerbates it by adding the puzzles of the ontological status of a\nthird realm, or of a transcendental ego, or of “pure\nthinking”, and the influence of all of these on your\nthinking as you read this. Wundt finds a simpler solution in his\nperspectivism. The logical may be considered “purely” from\na logical point of view, i.e., in terms of its normative character,\nor “genetically” from a psychological point of\nview. But there are no logical laws that are not also describable\npsychologically, just as there is no psychological phenomenon not also\ndescribable physiologically. But being “describable” in\nthis sense is not the same as being explicable, and it is\nthis separate task of explanation that falls to logic and psychology,\nrespectively. The logical description saves the phenomenon of\nnormativity, just as the psychological description saves the\nphenomenon of the interiority of consciousness. \nWundt’s conception of psychology was always controversial. At\nleast in Germany, the struggle over the status and philosophical\nmeaning of “consciousness” resulted, on the one hand, in\nthe exclusion of Wundtian empiricism from philosophy departments,\nstriving to maintain their speculative purity, and, on the other, the\ninstitutional establishment of experimental psychology as an\nindependent discipline. This was not the outcome Wundt had desired. He\nhad wished to reform philosophy, not as a synthetic science,\nbut with a direct, indispensable, juridical relation\nvis-à-vis both the natural and human sciences. He\nnever saw his psychological scientism as a threat to\nphilosophy—on the contrary, he considered his psychology to be a\npart of philosophy (cf. Boring 1950: 325), one necessary for\nphilosophy to take its proper place in the totality of the sciences.\nIndeed, philosophy could only assume that position through the\nmediating position of psychology (PP I: 3). Yet academic\nphilosophers, denied the possibility of any legislative or executive\nfunctions in the sciences, rejected the juridical ones as well,\nbitterly resisting contamination of their pure pursuit by the\nempiricism of the new psychology. In Germany, resistance was\nespecially stiff among neo-Kantians, and later the Phenomenologists.\nIn the end, the quarreling parties ineluctably assumed positions\nsimilar to their opponents’—though of course in a\n“purified”\n way.[52] \nLet us return to James’s mean\n remark[53]\n about Wundt: he has no noeud vital, no central idea, and so\nthis would-be Napoleon planarian can never be “killed all at\nonce”. Setting aside Wundt’s need to be killed at once or\nin bits, a fair and attentive reader will respectfully reject such\nscintillating criticisms. For although Wundt has many\nideas—“the theory of actuality”, the\n“principle of psychophysical parallelism”,\n“voluntarism”, “creative resultants”, etc.,\netc.—yet they all do have a single unifying node, namely what I\nhave here called “monistic perspectivism”. If Wundt has a\nbig idea, it is that Being is a single flow of Becoming with many\nsides and many ways of being described. Consequently we, as\npart of this Being, have many ways of describing and explaining it.\nFew have as unblinkingly accepted the consequences of their starting\npoints, or more doggedly pursued them to their various ends as\nWundt.","contact.mail":"Alan.Kim@stonybrook.edu","contact.domain":"stonybrook.edu"}]
