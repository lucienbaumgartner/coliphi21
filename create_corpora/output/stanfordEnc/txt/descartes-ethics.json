Some have\ncharged that it is a weakness of his philosophy that it\nfocuses exclusively on metaphysics and epistemology to the exclusion\nof moral and political philosophy. Such criticisms rest on a\nmisunderstanding of the broader framework of Descartes’ philosophy.\nEvidence of Descartes’ concern for the practical import of philosophy\ncan be traced to his earliest writings. In agreement with the\nancients, he identifies the goal of philosophy with the attainment of\na wisdom that is sufficient for happiness. The details of this\nposition are developed most fully in writings from the latter part of\nDescartes’ career: his correspondence with Princess Elisabeth, The\nPassions of the Soul, and the preface to the French translation\nof the Principles of Philosophy, where he presents his famous\nimage of the tree of philosophy, whose uppermost branch is “the\nhighest and most perfect moral system, which presupposes a complete\nknowledge of the other sciences and is the ultimate level of wisdom.”\n\n\n\n\nDescartes did not write extensively on ethics, and this has led some\nto assume that the topic lacks a place within his philosophy. This\nassumption has been bolstered by the tendency, prevalent until\nrecently, to base an understanding of Descartes’ philosophy primarily\non his two most famous books, Discourse on the Method and\nMeditations on First Philosophy. Although both works offer\ninsight into Descartes’ ethics, neither presents his position in\ndetail. (For comprehensive treatments of Descartes’ ethical thought, see Kambouchner 2009; Marshall 1998; Morgan 1994; Rodis-Lewis 1970.) \n\nDescartes’ writings reveal a consistent conception of philosophy’s\ngoal. In the first rule of the unfinished Rules for the Direction\nof the Mind, he states: “The aim of our studies should be to\ndirect the mind with a view to forming true and sound judgements about\nwhatever comes before it” (AT X 359/CSM I 9). The principal goal of\nphilosophy is to cultivate one’s capacity for sound judgment, which\nDescartes identifies with “good sense” (le bons sens) and\n“universal wisdom.” This goal should be pursued for its own sake,\nsince other ends may distract us from the course of\ninquiry. Nevertheless, Descartes insists upon the practical benefits\nof the wisdom thereby achieved: one should consider “how to increase\nthe natural light of his reason… in order that his intellect should\nshow his will what decision it ought to make in each of life’s\ncontingencies” (AT X 361/CSM I 10). In this way, we can expect to\nrealize the “legitimate fruits” of the sciences: “the comforts of\nlife” and “the pleasure to be gained from contemplating the truth,\nwhich is practically the only happiness in this life that is complete\nand untroubled by pain” (ibid.). \nThe last point previews one of the principal concerns of Descartes’ ethics.\nIn agreement with the ancients, he takes philosophy’s practical goal\nto be the realization of a happy life: one in which we enjoy the best\nexistence that a human being can hope to achieve. Descartes\ncharacterizes this life in terms of a type of mental contentment, or tranquility,\nthat is experienced by the person with a well-ordered mind. \nHere the \ninfluence of Stoic and Epicurean writers is evident (Cottingham 1998; Gueroult 1985; Pereboom 1994). In keeping with a\ncentral theme of Hellenistic ethics, Descartes likens philosophy\nto a form of therapy that can treat the mind’s illnesses (those that\nstand in the way of its happiness), just as medicine treats the\nillnesses of the body. As he writes in one of his earliest recorded\nremarks, “I use the term ‘vice’ to refer to the diseases of\nthe mind, which are not so easy to recognize as diseases of the\nbody. This is because we have frequently experienced sound bodily\nhealth, but have never known true health of the mind” (AT X 215/CSM I\n3). Philosophy is thus charged with leading us to “true health of the\nmind,” which it does through the cultivation of “true and sound\njudgment.” It is significant that Descartes—again in agreement with\nthe ancients—focuses his efforts on the happiness that can be\nrealized within the natural life of a human being. He is careful to\nnote that it is a dogma of faith that “the supreme happiness,” consisting\n“solely in the contemplation of the divine majesty” and attainable\nonly through divine grace, is reserved for the “next life” (AT VII\n52/CSM II 36). However, in contrast to the position defended by\nAquinas and Roman Catholic theology, the consideration of this\n“supernatural bliss” (béatitude surnaturelle) plays no\nrole in Descartes’ system. On the contrary, he\nemphasizes that genuine happiness is attainable within\nthis life, in spite of the trials we face. “One of the main points of\nmy own ethical code,” he tells Mersenne, “is to love life without\nfearing death” (AT II 480–1/CSMK 131). The key to developing this\naffirmative attitude toward life is the cultivation of reason: “True\nphilosophy… teaches that even amidst the saddest disasters and most\nbitter pains we can always be content, provided that we know how to\nuse our reason” (AT IV 314/CSMK 272). \n\nDescartes’ estimation of the importance of ethics is expressed most\nclearly in the programmatic statement that prefaces the French\ntranslation of the Principles of Philosophy (1647). Here he\npresents his conception of philosophy in strikingly traditional terms:\n“the word ‘philosophy’ means the study of wisdom, and by\n‘wisdom’  is meant not only prudence in our everyday affairs\nbut also a perfect knowledge of all things that mankind is capable of\nknowing, both for the conduct of life and for the preservation of\nhealth and the discovery of all manner of skills” (AT IXB 2/CSM I\n179). The key to the attainment of this wisdom, Descartes argues, is\nthe recognition of the essential order among the different parts of\nour knowledge, an order he depicts in his image of the “tree of\nphilosophy”: “The roots are metaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the\nbranches emerging from the trunk are all the other sciences, which may\nbe reduced to three principal ones, namely medicine, mechanics and\nmorals” (AT IXB 14/CSM I 186). Within this scheme, metaphysics is\nfoundational, but this knowledge and the knowledge of physics that is\nbuilt upon it are sought for the sake of the practical benefits that\nfollow from the sciences of medicine, mechanics and morals: “just as\nit is not the roots or the trunk of a tree from which one gathers the\nfruit, but only the ends of the branches, so the principal benefit of\nphilosophy depends on those parts of it which can only be learned last\nof all” (AT IXB 15/CSM I 186). Foremost among these sciences is la\nmorale: “the highest and most perfect moral system, which\npresupposes a complete knowledge of the other sciences and is the\nultimate level of wisdom” (ibid.). It is for the sake of this science\nabove all that Descartes hopes his readers will “realize how important\nit is to continue the search for these truths, and to what a high\ndegree of wisdom, and to what perfection and felicity of life, these\ntruths can bring us” (AT IXB 20/CSM I 190). \n\nWhile it is clear that Descartes accords a privileged place to the\nscience he calls la morale, the fact remains that he left\nno systematic presentation of his ethical views. \nHe offers several explanations for why he has\nnot devoted more attention to ethics. Given his conception of the\norder of knowledge, conclusions in ethics must be established in a\nway that reveals their dependence on the prior conclusions of\nmetaphysics and physics. Thus, the systematic investigation of ethics\ncan begin only after certainty has been achieved in these prior\ntheoretical disciplines. In a late letter to Chanut, Descartes cites\ntwo further reasons for his silence on the topic: “It is true that\nnormally I refuse to write down my thoughts concerning morality. I\nhave two reasons for this. One is that there is no other subject in\nwhich malicious people can so readily find pretexts for vilifying me;\nand the other is that I believe only sovereigns, or those authorized\nby them, have the right to concern themselves with regulating the\nmorals of other people” (AT V 86–7/CSMK 326). The first of these\nreasons reflects Descartes’ inherent caution, reinforced by the\nhostile reception his philosophy had received at the University of\nUtrecht (Gaukroger 1995; Verbeek 1992). The second points to an important limitation in Descartes’\nconception of ethics: he does not enunciate a specific set of \nobligations, because these, he believes, are the purview of the\nsovereign. This again may make it seem that Descartes rejects a\nsubstantial role for philosophy in ethics, and that he offers in its place a\nHobbesian account of the authority of moral dictates grounded in a\nsovereign will. There is an element of truth in this suggestion, but\nuncovering it requires drawing a crucial distinction: if Descartes\nlimits the role of philosophy in determining specific moral rules, he\nnonetheless upholds the ancients’ conception of philosophy as the search\nfor a wisdom sufficient for happiness.  It is in this sense that\nethics remains central to Descartes’ philosophy. \n\nThe best-known expression of Descartes’ ethical views is the\n“provisional moral code” (une morale par provision) that\nappears in Part Three of Discourse on the Method. Some have\nread this as a reliable statement of Descartes’ considered position, but\nthis is consistent neither with the content of the Discourse itself nor with that of\nhis later writings. (For a detailed discussion of the “provisional morality” and a defense of its consistency with Descartes’ later views, see Marshall 1998 and 2003.) \nDescartes frames the rules of his\nprovisional morality as part of the epistemological project—the\nsearch for certainty—announced in Part Two of the Discourse.\nIn order that he may act decisively and live as happily as possible\nwhile avoiding “precipitate conclusions and assumptions,” Descartes\nproposes “a provisional moral code consisting of just three or four\nmaxims”: \n\nDescartes’ apparent uncertainty about the number of rules in his\nprovisional code (“three or four”) is noteworthy and may be explained\nby the different status he assigns to the rules. While the first three\nprescribe how to act in the absence of any certain knowledge of good\nand evil (including the much-criticized deference to the laws and\ncustoms of his country), the fourth rule holds out the possibility of\ncultivating his reason so as to arrive at knowledge of the\ntruth. Echoing his remarks in the Rules, he says that in the\ndiscovery of such truths he has experienced “such extreme contentment\nthat I did not think one could enjoy any sweeter or purer one in this\nlife” (AT VI 27/CSM I 124). This might be read as limiting our\nhappiness to the contemplation of intellectual truths of the sort\nannounced in Part Four of the Discourse; however, Descartes\nmakes it clear that he sees the search for truth as having a practical\nimport as well. By following the method he has prescribed for himself\nand exercising his capacity for judgment, he is confident of acquiring all the true knowledge of which he is capable,\nand “in this way all the true goods within my reach” (AT VI 28/CSM I\n125). \n\nIt is evident, then, that the first three maxims of the “provisional\nmoral code” are just that—provisional rules that Descartes will\nfollow while he carries out his search for certain knowledge—and that\nhe is confident that this search will terminate in knowledge of “true\ngoods” that will supply reliable directives for action. Descartes\nhints at the range of these goods in Part Five of the\nDiscourse. They include the maintenance of health,\n“which is undoubtedly the first good [le premier bien] and\nthe foundation of all the other goods in this life.” Because “the mind\ndepends so much on the temperament and disposition of the bodily\norgans,” Descartes adds, we must look to medicine if we are “to find\nsome means of making men in general wiser and more skilful than they\nhave been up till now” (AT VI 62/CSM I 143).  The extent of Descartes’\ncommitment to the integration of physical and psychological health\nwill become apparent in the Passions of the Soul. It would be\na mistake, however, to conclude from this that he proposes a reduction\nof ethics to medicine.  As presented already in the\nDiscourse, his ethics is founded on an ideal of virtue as a\nperfected power of judgment, together with the assumption that virtue\nby itself is sufficient for happiness: \n\nAnticipated in this passage are the core ideas of Descartes’ ethics:\nthe notion of virtue, as a disposition of the will to judge\nin accordance with reason’s representations of the good, and the notion\nof happiness, as a state of mental well-being that is\nachieved through the practice of virtue. In his correspondence with\nPrincess Elisabeth, Descartes will elaborate on the\nrelationship between these two ideas. Here is it worth noting that\nwhile it is virtue that links ethics to the broader goal of the\ncultivation of reason, Descartes gives no less weight to the\nimportance of happiness, in the form of tranquility. This is made\nclear near the end of the Discourse, when he explains why, in\nspite of his reservations, he has published the book under his own\nname: “I am not excessively fond of glory—indeed if I dare to say so,\nI dislike it in so far as I regard it as opposed to that tranquility\nwhich I value above everything else…. [I]f I had done this\n[sc. concealed his identity] I thought I would do myself an injustice,\nand moreover that would have given me a certain sort of disquiet,\nwhich again would have been opposed to the perfect peace of mind I am\nseeking” (AT VI 74/CSM I 149). \n\nThe Meditations is distinguished from Descartes’ other works\nin explicitly foreswearing practical concerns. The conceit of the\nMeditations is a thinker who has abstracted himself from any\nconnection to the external world. For this reason, Descartes feels\nconfident in pursuing the method of hyperbolic doubt, which rejects as\nfalse any opinion concerning which the slightest doubt can be raised:\n“I know that no danger or error will result from my plan, and that I\ncannot possibly go too far in my distrustful attitude. This is because\nthe task now in hand does not involve action but merely the\nacquisition of knowledge” (AT VII 22/CSM II 15).  \n\nOn these grounds, one might feel justified in setting aside the\nMeditations in an examination of Descartes’ ethics. In fact,\nthough, the Meditations pursues, in a theoretical context,\nan inquiry that is closely related to ethics: the proper disposition\nof the will. (For readings of the Meditations as supporting the development of  virtue, see Naaman Lauderer 2010; Shapiro 2005, 2013.) \nDescartes takes the operation of the will to be integral\nto both belief and action. In general, the will, or “freedom of\nchoice,” consists “in our ability to do or not do something (that is,\nto affirm or deny, to pursue or avoid); or rather, it consists simply\nin the fact that when the intellect puts something forward for\naffirmation or denial or for pursuit or avoidance, our inclinations\nare such that we do not feel we are determined by any external force”\n(AT VII 57/CSM II 40). For Descartes, freedom is an essential\nproperty of the will; however, this freedom does not entail\nindifference: “if I always saw clearly what was true and good, I\nshould never have to deliberate about the right judgement or choice;\nin that case, although I should be wholly free, it would be impossible\nfor me ever to be in a state of indifference” (AT VII 58/CSM II\n40). We are indifferent only when our perception of the true, or of\nthe good, is less than clear and distinct. \n\nDescartes assigns the will a pivotal role in the pursuit of\nknowledge. When presented with a clear and distinct perception of what\nis true, the will is compelled to assent to it. When the perception is\nless than fully clear and distinct, the will is not compelled in the\nsame way. In such cases, it has the power either to assent or to\nwithhold assent. Given this, the correct use of free will is\nidentified as the critical factor in the attainment of knowledge:\n“If… I simply refrain from making a judgment in cases where I do not\nperceive the truth with sufficient clarity and distinctness, then it\nis clear that I am behaving correctly and avoiding error. But if in\nsuch cases, I either affirm or deny, then I not using my free will\ncorrectly” (AT VII 59–60/CSM II 41). Provided we refrain from assenting\nto what is not clearly and distinctly perceived, our judgments are\nguaranteed to be true. \n\nIn the Fourth Meditation, Descartes draws a close parallel between the\nwill’s relation to the true and to the good. Just as the will is compelled\nto assent to what is clearly and distinctly perceived to be true, so\nit is compelled to choose what is clearly and distinctly perceived to\nbe good: “if I always saw clearly what was true and good, I should\nnever have to deliberate about the right judgement or choice” (AT VII\n58/CSM II 40). And analogously, we might suppose, just as the recipe\nfor avoiding error is to withhold assent from that whose truth is not\nperceived clearly and distinctly, so the recipe for avoiding moral\nerror, or sin, is to refuse to choose that whose goodness is not\nperceived clearly and distinctly. In his objections to the\nMeditations, Arnauld cautioned Descartes on this point,\nsuggesting that the comments he makes “on the cause of error would\ngive rise to the most serious objections if they were stretched out of\ncontext to cover the pursuit of good and evil” (AT VII 215/CSM II\n151).  Heeding Arnauld’s warning, Descartes added a disclaimer to the\nSynopsis of the Meditations: “But here it should be noted in\npassing that I do not deal at all with sin, i.e. the error which is\ncommitted in pursuing good and evil, but only with the error that\noccurs in distinguishing truth and falsehood” (AT VII 15/CSM II\n11). This assertion flatly contradicts the text of the Fourth\nMeditation, where Descartes had written that, where the will is\nindifferent, “it easily turns aside from what is true and good, and\nthis is the source of my error and sin” (AT VII 58/CSM II 40–1). In\nlight of this, and Descartes’ insistence to Mersenne that the\ndisclaimer be placed in parentheses to indicate that it had been\nadded, there is reason to see Descartes as upholding the same account of the will in relation to the true and to the good. \n\nThere is nonetheless one important way in which the operation of the\nwill in a purely theoretical context (such as the\nMeditations) must be distinguished from its operation in \npractical contexts. In the pursuit of certainty, Descartes claims that\nit is both possible and reasonable to withhold assent from any idea\nthat is not perceived clearly and distinctly. Outside the isolated\nconfines of the Meditations, however, it is impossible to\nmaintain such an attitude of detachment. Life demands that we act, by\nchoosing among competing goods on the basis of ideas that are often\nless than clear and distinct. When faced with the exigencies of\nexistence, suspension of choice is not an option. Since we are\nforced to act under conditions of uncertainty, it might seem to\nfollow that we are condemned to a life of moral error, constantly\nmaking wrong choices on the basis of inadequate perceptions of the\ngoodness and badness of objects. This may be the ordinary lot\nof human beings; however, Descartes does not believe that this\ncondition is irremediable. In his later writings he presents an\naccount of virtue that shows how we can improve our ability to\nmake right choices, or to act virtuously, despite the inadequacy\nof much of our knowledge. \n\nDescartes’ correspondence with Princess Elisabeth has as its central\ntopic the relation of mind and body—a relation that is explored from\nthe point of view of both theory (the problem of mind-body union) and\npractice (see Shapiro 2007 for a full account of the correspondence). With regard to practice, Descartes is again concerned\nwith the connection between physical and mental well-being, and in\nparticular the deleterious effects of passions such as sadness, grief,\nfear and melancholy. He discusses these topics in the course of\nadvising Elisabeth on how to cope with her own illness and distress.\nThe question, however, is an ancient one: when faced with the\nhardships of life—physical illness, loss, anxiety—how can one\nrespond in a way that allows one to preserve the tranquility that is the core of our happiness? \n\nDescartes’ abiding interest in medicine is prominent here,\nsince the treatment of physical illness is an effective way of\nremoving one of main sources of mental disturbance. Yet he is well\naware of the limits of medical knowledge, and so he acknowledges that\nthe passions also must be confronted directly: “They are domestic\nenemies with whom we are forced to keep company, and we have to be\nperpetually on guard lest they injure us” (AT IV 218/CSMK 249).\nDescartes prescribes to Elisabeth a two-part remedy for protecting\nherself against the harmful effects of the passions: “so far as\npossible to distract our imagination and senses from them, and when\nobliged by prudence to consider them, to do so with our intellect\nalone” (ibid.). The first part of the remedy relies on our ability to\ndirect the imagination away from the immediate objects of the\npassions.  Given this power, Descartes argues, “there might be a\nperson who had countless genuine reasons for distress but who took\nsuch pains to direct his imagination that he never thought of them\nexcept when compelled by some practical nececessity, and who spent the\nrest of his time in the consideration of objects which could furnish\ncontentment and joy” (AT IV 219/CSMK 250). Intriguingly, Descartes\nspeculates that this kind of cognitive therapy by itself might be\nsufficient to restore the patient to health. In circumventing the\ncausal pathway by which the passion arises, the body will be returned\nto a healthy state. Descartes offers his own history as an example of\nthis phenomenon: “From [my mother] I inherited a dry cough and a pale\ncolour which stayed with me until I was more than twenty, so that all\nthe doctors who saw me up to that time gave it as their verdict that I\nwould die young. But I have always had an inclination to look at\nthings from the most favorable angle and to make my principal\nhappiness depend upon myself alone, and I believe that this\ninclination caused the indisposition, which was almost part of my\nnature, gradually to disappear completely” (AT IV 221/CSMK 251). This\nline of thought leads directly to the Passions of the Soul,\nin which Descartes discusses at length the causation and function of\nthe passions. \n\nThe second part of the remedy prescribed to Elisabeth aligns\nDescartes’ position with that of the ancients, who stress the role\nof reason in regulating the passions. The person who is led by passion\nwill inevitably experience sadness, grief, fear,\nanxiety—emotions inconsistent with “perfect happiness.” Such\nhappiness is the possession alone of those elevated souls in\nwhich reason “always remains mistress”: \n\nThe link between reason and happiness is explored at length by\nDescartes in letters exchanged with Elisabeth during the summer and\nfall of 1645. The discussion begins with Descartes’ suggestion that\nthey examine what the ancients had to say on the topic, and he chooses\nas exemplary Seneca’s work “On the Happy Life” (De Vita\nBeata). Descartes, however, quickly becomes dissatisfied with\nSeneca’s treatment and proposes instead to explain to Elizabeth how he\nthinks the subject “should have been treated by such a philosopher,\nunenlightened by faith, with only natural reason to guide him” (AT IV\n263/CSMK 257). \n\nBasic to Descartes’ account is the distinction he draws between (i)\nthe supreme good, (ii) happiness, and (iii) the final end or goal,\nnotions generally taken as equivalent in ancient eudaimonism (AT IV\n275/CSMK 261). Descartes identifies the supreme good with virtue,\nwhich he defines as “a firm and constant will to bring about\neverything we judge to be the best and to employ all the force of our\nintellect in judging well” (AT IV 277/CSMK 262). Virtue is the supreme\ngood, he argues, because it is “the only good, among all those we can\npossess, which depends entirely on our free will” (AT IV 276/CSMK\n261), and because it is sufficient for happiness. Descartes explains\nhappiness (la béatitude) in psychological\nterms. It is the “perfect contentment of mind and inner\nsatisfaction… which is acquired by the wise without fortune’s favor”\n(AT IV 264/CSMK 257).  According to Descartes, “we cannot ever\npractice any virtue—that is to say, do what our reason tells us we\nshould do—without receiving satisfaction and pleasure from doing so”\n(AT IV 284/CSMK 263). Thus, happiness is a natural product of virtue\nand can be enjoyed regardless of what fortune brings. The dependence\nof happiness on virtue is confirmed by Descartes’ account of the final\nend, which, he says, can be regarded either as happiness or as the\nsupreme good: virtue is the target at which we ought to aim, but\nhappiness is the prize that induces us to fire at it (AT IV 277/CMSK\n262). (For further discussion of the form of Descartes’ ethical theory and its relation to ancient eudaimonist theories, see Naaman-Zauderer 1010; Rutherford 2004, 2014; Shapiro 2008, 2011; Svensson 2010, 2015.) \n\nAs Descartes defines it, virtue depends upon the employment of\nreason. Though it is conceivable that one might have a “firm and\nconstant will” to do something without having examined whether it is\nthe right thing to do, one cannot have a firm and constant will to do\nwhat is judged to be the best, unless one is capable of judging what\nthe best is. Thus, virtue presupposes knowledge of the relative\ngoodness of objects of choice, and this knowledge Descartes assigns to reason: “The\ntrue function of reason… is to examine and consider without passion\nthe value of all the perfections, both of the body and of the soul,\nwhich can be acquired by our conduct, so that… we shall always\nchoose the better” (AT IV 286–7/CSMK 265). \n\nBut how exactly does reason allow us to discriminate between lesser\nand greater goods? On one point Descartes’ position is clear: the\nclaim of virtue to be the supreme good follows from the fact that it\nis nothing more than the correct use of our free will, employing it\nto choose whatever reason represents as the greatest good. As\nDescartes argues in the Fourth Meditation, we are in no way more like\nGod—that is, more perfect—than in our possession of free will. Hence\nthe correct use of this will is our greatest good: “free will is in\nitself the noblest thing we can have, since it makes us in a way equal\nto God and seems to exempt us from being his subjects; and so its\ncorrect use is the greatest of all the goods we possess” (AT V 85/CSMK\n326). Reason shows that the greatest good within our power is the\nperfection of the will. In any choice we make, the value of the\nparticular goods we pursue will always be less than that of the will\nitself; hence, provided we act virtuously, we can be content, whether\nor not we succeed in obtaining whatever other goods we seek. \n\nYet this still leaves open the question of how to assess the value of\nthese other goods. The supreme good, virtue, consists in a firm\nresolution to bring about whatever reason judges to be the best. But\non the basis of what does reason make this determination? What\nknowledge allows reason to form a well-founded judgment about the\ngoodness and badness of ends, in the pursuit of which we act\nvirtuously? Descartes criticizes Seneca on just this point—that he\nfails to teach us “all the principal truths whose knowledge is\nnecessary to facilitate the practice of virtue and to regulate our\ndesires and passions, and thus to enjoy natural happiness” (AT IV\n267/CSMK 258). In response, Elisabeth worries that Descartes’ account,\nwhich promises the attainment of happiness, might presuppose more\nknowledge than we can possibly possess. In assuaging her concern,\nDescartes summarizes the knowledge he believes we can rely on in\ndirecting the will toward virtuous ends. It consists of a surprisingly\nsmall set of “the truths most useful to us.” The first two are basic\nprinciples of Cartesian metaphysics as presented in the\nMeditations: \n\nThe next three truths derive from Cartesian natural philosophy,\nbroadly understood: \n\nThe final proposition is of a quite different character: \n\nThe truths that Descartes takes to be “most useful to us” do not\nconsist of discoveries original to his philosophy. Rather, they\nreflect a general outlook on the world that could be embraced by\nsomeone without Cartesian sympathies: the existence of an omnipotent\nand supremely perfect God; the immortality of the soul; the vastness\nof the universe; that we have duties to a larger whole of which we are\na part; that our passions often distort the goodness of their\nobjects. What Descartes can claim at most (and what he does claim in\nthe preface to the Principles of Philosophy) is that he has\nsupplied better reasons for believing these propositions to be true;\nhe has established certain knowledge where before there was only\nunstable belief. \n\nThe establishment of a body of knowledge relevant to the practice of\nvirtue supplies the basis for a new set of moral rules that replaces\nthe provisional morality of the Discourse. Descartes presents\nthem to Elisabeth as a succinct recipe for happiness: \n\nHere the Discourse’s final provisional rule has become the\nfirst rule, reflecting the assumption that reason, in the form of\njudgments about good and evil, can serve as a reliable guide for\naction. Similarly, the Discourse’s second rule, which\nprescribed that one be “as firm and decisive in [one’s] actions” as\none can, and “follow even the most doubtful opinions” once adopted,\nhas now become an injunction to carry out whatever reason recommends\nwithout being diverted by the passions. The two sets of rules overlap\nmost closely in the third rule, which counsels us to recognize the\nlimits of our power and to curtail our desires for things outside of\nit. In this case too, however, the rule now has a different status for\nDescartes, since it is supported by certain knowledge of God, on whom\nall things depend, and the immortality of the soul. \n\nThe truths that Descartes presents to Elisabeth supply a body of\nrational knowledge on the basis of which we are able to use our free\nwill correctly, choosing good over evil. Clearly, though, the guidance\noffered by these truths is of the most general sort. They do not\nunderwrite specific directives for action or dictate what we ought to\ndo in any particular circumstance. Instead, they are best seen simply\nas facilitating right action, by removing impediments to it (anxiety\nabout the future, fear of death) or saving us from obvious errors\n(ignoring the concerns of others, giving priority to bodily goods).\nThat the content of morality is underdetermined by the knowledge on\nwhich it depends is made clear by Descartes’ final proposition, which\ninstructs us to defer to the laws and customs of the land when it is\nnot obvious how we ought to act. This proposition echoes the first\nrule of provisional morality that Descartes prescribes for himself in\nthe Discourse. However, this rule, too, has undergone an\nimportant transformation. Whereas in the Discourse deference\nto the laws and customs of one’s country is presented as the first\nrule of provisional morality, to Elisabeth it is offered as a fallback\nposition, acknowledging that while we do indeed possess certain\nknowledge of good and evil, there are limits to this knowledge. \n\nThe recognition of these limits is an enduring feature of Descartes’\nethics. The truths outlined to Elizabeth lay down a set of general\nguidelines for how to use the will correctly. Following them, however,\ndoes not guarantee that we infallibly choose the greatest good; nor is\nsuccess of this sort required for virtue. As far as virtue is\nconcerned, the critical point is that we do whatever we can to\nascertain the best course of action, appealing if necessary to civil\nlaw or custom, and that we then will decisively. (For more on this point, see Rutherford 2014.)  \n\nThis creates an important disanalogy for Descartes between the\ntheoretical and the practical. In both cases, we have a responsibility\nto correct our understanding before committing the will in judgment. Only in the theoretical realm, however, is it reasonable to\nsuspend assent indefinitely if we lack the knowledge needed to be\nconfident of the correctness of our decision. In the case of action,\nDescartes denies that this is appropriate: “As far as the conduct of\nlife is concerned, I am very far from thinking that we should assent\nonly to what is clearly perceived. On the contrary, I do not think\nthat we should always wait even for probable truths” (AT VII 149/CSM\nII 106). In acting, the essential thing is that we will in the right\nmanner, allowing reason to guide our choice so far as it can. “It\nis…  not necessary that our reason should be free from error,” he\ntells Elisabeth; “it is sufficient if our conscience testifies that we\nhave never lacked resolution and virtue to carry out whatever we have\njudged the best course” (AT IV 266/CSMK 258). Resolution, or firmness\nof judgment, is crucial, for it is the lack of this, above all, that\ncauses “regret and remorse” and thereby threatens our happiness\n(AT IV 264/CSMK 257). \n\nDescartes’ correspondence with Princess Elisabeth led directly to the\ncomposition of his final book, The Passions of the Soul, a\nlarge part of which was written during the winter of 1645–6. In a\nprefatory letter to the book, Descartes maintains that in it he has\nset out to explain the passions “only as a natural philosopher\n[physicien], and not as a rhetorician or even as a moral\nphilosopher” (AT XI 326/CSM I 327). On the face of it, this seems to\nbe contradicted by the contents of the book, since much of it is\ndevoted to understanding the passions from an ethical point of\nview—that is, understanding how they can be accommodated to the goal\nof happiness.  The significance of Descartes’ remark lies in the\nparticular account he gives of the passions. In general, they are\ndefined as “those perceptions, sensations or emotions of the soul\nwhich we refer particularly to it, and which are caused, maintained\nand strengthened by some movement of the [animal] spirits” (art. 27;\nCSM I 338–9).  Descartes’ central thesis is that the passions\noriginate in bodily changes, which are communicated by the animal\nspirits to the pineal gland, and thereby give rise to affective states in the\nsoul—affections which are referred to the soul itself and not to the\nbody. Because the passions originate in the body, a large part of the\nbook is devoted to differentiating the passions and accounting for\ntheir effects in physiological terms; hence Descartes’ claim to\nexplain them as a natural philosopher. (For extended treatments of Descartes’ theory of the passions, see Brown 2006; James 1997; Kambouchner 1995a, b.) \n\nDescartes distinguishes six primitive passions: wonder, love, hatred,\ndesire, joy and sadness. All the rest are either composed from these\nor species of them (art. 69). The passions operate in a common manner:\n“the principal effect of all the human passions is that they move and\ndispose the soul to want the things for which they prepare the body.”\nThus, the passsions are in the first place motivational states that\ndispose the soul to will specific actions: “the feeling of fear moves\nthe soul to want to flee, that of courage to want to fight, and\nsimilarly with the others” (art. 40; CSM I 343). Different passions\nresult from the effects of different motions on the pineal gland; and\nthese, Descartes assumes, have been ordained by God for the sake of\npreserving the human body: “The function of all the passions consists\nsolely in this, that they dispose our soul to want the things which\nnature deems useful for us, and to persist in this volition; and the\nsame agitation of the spirits which normally causes the passions also\ndisposes the body to make movements which help to attain these things”\n(art. 52; CSM I 349). (Exactly how to characterize the passions as mental states remains controversial. In addition to the works already cited, see Brassfield 2012; Greenberg 2009; Hoffman 1991; Schmitter 2008.) \n\nGiven their natural function of preserving the body, the passions are\nall by nature good (art. 211). They spur us to act in ways that are in\ngeneral conducive to our well-being. However, the effects of the\npassions are not uniformly beneficial. Because they exaggerate\nthe goodness or badness of their objects, they can lead us to pursue apparent goods or flee apparent harms too quickly. The passions are also ordered\nfor the sake of the preservation of the body, and not the contentment\nof the soul; and because they originate in the body, any malfunction\nof the latter can disrupt the normal operation of the passions. For\nthese reasons, it is necessary that the passions be regulated by\nreason, whose “proper weapons” against their misuse and excess are\n“firm and determinate judgements bearing upon the knowledge of good\nand evil, which the soul has resolved to follow in guiding its\nconduct” (art. 48; CSM I 347). Summarizing his position at the end of\nthe Passions, Descartes says that “the chief use of wisdom lies in\nits teaching us to be masters of our passions and to control them with\nsuch skill that the evils which they cause are quite bearable, and\neven become a source of joy” (art. 212; CSM I 404). \n\nOver and above the role they play in the preservation of the body, the\npassions also make a direct contribution to human happiness. In the\nconcluding article of the Passions, Descartes goes so far as\nto say that “it is on the passions alone that all the good and evil of\nthis life depends” (art. 212; CSM I 404). In the body of the article,\nhe qualifies this claim, allowing that “the soul can have pleasures of\nits own. But the pleasures common to it and the body depend entirely\non the passions.” His considered view on this question seems to be\nthat the passions (particularly those of love and joy) form a valuable\npart of a human life, that the enjoyment of them is consistent\nwith the happiness that is the natural product of virtue, but\nthat happiness of the latter sort can be had even in the presence of\nharmful passions such as sadness or grief. \n\nHappiness, as Descartes defines it for Elisabeth, is a “perfect\ncontentment of mind and inner satisfaction” (AT IV 264/CSMK 257), or\nthe “satisfaction and pleasure” that accompanies the practice of\nvirtue (AT IV 284/CSMK 263). In the Passions, he\ndistinguishes these affects from the passions that originate in the\nbody. The former are described as “internal emotions of the soul,”\nwhich are “produced in the soul only by the soul itself. In this they\ndiffer from its passions, which always depend on some movement of the\n[animal] spirits” (art. 147; CSM I 381). “Internal emotions” are thus\nindependent of the body and the basis of a happiness that can\nwithstand “the most violent assaults of the passions”: \n\nDescartes is committed to the view that virtue is\nsufficient for happiness, that is, a “perfect contentment of mind and inner satisfaction.” At the same time, he denies that virtue has value only as a means to happiness. On the contrary, virtue is grounded in the one aspect of human nature that is\nof unconditional value: the exercise of our free will, the perfection of the\nsoul that “renders us in a certain way like God by making us masters\nof ourselves” (art. 152; CSM I 384). The full flowering of virtue is found\nin the moral ideal Descartes calls “generosity,”\nwhich he describes as “the key to all the other virtues” (art. 161; CSM I 388).\nGenerosity begins as a passion, prompted by thoughts of the nature of free will and the many advantages that follow from its correct use and the many cares that follow from its misuse. Repetition of these thoughts and of the consequent passion produces the virtue of generosity, which is a “habit” of the soul (art. 161; CSM I 387). This habit, “true generosity,” has two components, one  intellectual, the other volitional: “The first consists in [a person’s] knowing that nothing truly\nbelongs to him but this freedom to dispose his volitions, and that he\nought to be praised or blamed for no other reason than his using this\nfreedom well or badly.  The second consists in his feeling within\nhimself a firm and constant resolution to use it well—that is, never\nto lack the will to undertake and carry out whatever he judges to be\nbest. To do that is to follow virtue perfectly” (art. 153; AT XI 445—6/\nCSM I 384). (For further discussion of the conditions of generosity, see Parvizian 2016; Rodis-Lewis 1987; Shapiro 1999, 2005.) \n\nGenerosity is an ideal of individual ethical perfection, but Descartes\nalso draws from it an important conclusion concerning our relations to\nothers (Brown 2006; Frierson 2002). Upon recognizing an element of unconditional value within\nhimself, the generous person is naturally led to extend this\nrecognition to others: “Those who possess this knowledge and this\nfeeling about themselves readily come to believe that any other person\ncan have the same knowledge and feeling about himself, because this\ninvolves nothing which depends on someone else.” Those who are endowed\nwith generosity are thus disposed to overlook conventional\ndistinctions of class and social status, and to focus on the true,\nintrinsic worth of each individual: \n\nThus, despite its nod to law and custom, which fill the space opened\nby the limits of our moral knowledge, Descartes’ ethics is crowned by\na principle of moral universalism. In virtue of their free will, all\nhuman beings have the same moral status and deserve equal moral\nrespect. In this we find an important anticipation of Kant’s ethics,\nwhich emerges from a similar consideration of the unconditional value\nof a rational and free will.","contact.mail":"drutherford@ucsd.edu","contact.domain":"ucsd.edu"}]
