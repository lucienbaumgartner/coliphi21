By\nutilizing one or more of the signature schemas of the Continental\ntradition, Continental feminists contribute to problem areas ranging\nfrom metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, and social and\npolitical philosophy. Continental feminism thus refers to a body and\nstyle of work consisting of feminist interpretations of mainstream\nContinental figures (largely from what is called “Continental\nEurope”, such as Hegel, Levinas, Derrida, Foucault); feminist\nuses of psychoanalysis, phenomenology, deconstruction, genealogy, and\ncritical theory; and of interpretations of European feminists and\nfigures such as de Beauvoir, Irigaray, Arendt, and Kristeva. Note,\nhowever, that Europe is not and has never been a continent, and in\nthis sense, Continental feminism, like Continental philosophy, is more\nof an imagined community of approaches, figures, and traditions, or an\numbrella concept, rather than a precise term.\n\n\nElaine Miller points out that the term “Continental\nfeminism” came into circulation in the United States in 2007\n(Miller 2017); as she defines it, Continental feminism\n\n\n\n\ninvolves a commitment to the historicity of philosophical concepts,\nincluding the sometimes-uncomfortable contexts of their production, a\nbelief that it is through the examination of texts that the genealogy\nof ideas can be traced and resources for critically responding to them\ncan be formulated, and that the “canon” is subject to\nconstant re-interrogation and reconfiguration. (Miller 2017: 154)\n\n\n\nIn Allison Stone’s terms,\n\n\n\n\ndescribing the world as it really is—not as an aggregate of\nstatic items but as an ever-shifting web of relations—calls for\nunfamiliar, difficult language. (Stone 2015: 4)\n\n\n\nA distinguishing feature of Continental feminism, Miller and Stone\nagree, is that it\n\n\n\n\nembodies a refusal to prima facie privilege clarity and\nsuccinctness of argument over acknowledging through language the\ncomplexity, difficulty, and problematic nature of the issues being\naddressed. (Miller 2017: 154; Stone 2015: 2)\n\n\n\nAs a way of beginning to address the Euro- and U.S.-centric biases of\ncontinental philosophy, a transContinental turn in Continental\nfeminism proposed by Kyoo Lee and Alyson Cole aims to incorporate a\nglobal view of feminist issues and theories, where\n\n\n\n\n“trans” serves as a marker for the constant geo-cultural\nflows of ideas in transit, as in “transatlantic”,\n“transpacific”, “transoceanic”, etc., as well\nas for cutting-edge works, conversations, and debates in\ntrans-critical, cultural, disciplinary, human, gender, genic, lingual,\nmedial, national fields, etc., and as trans*feminist discourses. (Cole\nand Lee 2019: iv)\n\n\n\nAccordingly, this entry will take Continental feminism to include the\nfollowing distinct yet related set of issues and areas: (1) the\nfeminist use of figures, traditions, and approaches of\nphenomenology/existentialism, psychoanalysis, post-structuralism\n(deconstruction and genealogy), and critical theory; (2) critical\ninterventions into the assumptions about sex, gender, class, race,\nability, religion, and age endemic to European philosophy; and (3)\ninterpretations of hitherto underrepresented figures and methods of\nfeminism from a transContinental and transAtlantic perspective that\nestablish new, abandoned, or previously delegitimated genealogies for\nfeminist thought.\n\n\nIt is important to note that not all Continental feminists are\nphilosophers or work in Philosophy departments; thus, Continental\nfeminism is interdisciplinary and its practitioners come from various\nfields. As this subfield developed in the early 2000s, there were\nalready disciplinary, intra-disciplinary and extra-disciplinary\nprojects that explored feminist issues by utilizing phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, deconstructive, and critical theoretical approaches.\nRather than organizing this entry around the signature schemas of the\nContinental tradition and subsuming ongoing work that uses these\napproaches under them, this entry will locate crucial genealogies for\nContinental feminism in the work of Black feminists, post- and\ndecolonial feminists, women of color feminists, Asian American\nfeminists, trans feminists, and queer feminists. We take these\ngenealogies as central to the past, present, and future of Continental\nfeminism, and accordingly this entry is organized topically, in order\nto outline the ways that Continental feminisms have developed in\nconversation and in tension with these interdisciplinary projects.\nThese projects have been unearthing the cissexist,\nsexist/misogynistic, racist, heterosexist, classist, ageist, ableist,\ncolonial commitments of philosophy as a discipline and a professional\nfield as they are simultaneously expanding, transforming, and pushing\nthe concerns and methods of Continental thought in interdisciplinary\niterations. Indeed, what distinguishes Continental feminism clearly\nfrom Analytic feminism are its call for interdisciplinarity and its\nbelief that feminist omissions themselves can become sites from which\nnew projects are launched, as will be highlighted throughout this\nentry. As such, Continental feminism starts with the premise that\nEuropean or Anglo-American norms and categories of thought can be\ninterpreted, critiqued, and re-envisioned or abandoned for feminist\npurposes.\n\nContinental feminists share with other Continental thinkers an\ninterest in close reading that uses careful exegesis to unpack the\ndeep meanings of texts through attention to their linguistic and\nhistorical specificity. However, to utilize a philosophical tradition\nthat has largely presumed rather than explored the impacts of sex and\ngender on material life, continental feminists often read irreverently\nto focus on concerns that traditional philosophy might push to the\nside. While all feminist theorizing deals with questions of power,\nsubjectivity, and culture, Continental feminist approaches to these\nissues are often critical in the sense that they explore how\nexternal power dynamics affect the constitution of inner experiences,\nand in turn how embodied and subjective re-articulations of power can\nand should transform the world in the pursuit of justice. This\nfrequently involves taking lived experience as a crucial component of\ncritical philosophy; as Gail Weiss puts it, \nonly by interrogating the “ordinary” dimensions of\nexperience is it possible to arrive at an understanding of the dynamic\nforces that give meaning to individual lives and that are both the\nobstacle and the vehicle to achieving lasting social change. (Weiss\n2008: 5) \nTo present a broad sketch of characteristics of continental feminism\nthroughout its history, this section focuses on methods that\nContinental feminists use to engage embodied experience in their\nprojects. The gendered critique of the traditional Western\nphilosophical tendency to dichotomize the body that feels and the mind\nthat thinks is an ongoing theme in continental feminism (see entry on\n feminist perspectives on the body).\n The account presented here is not at all complete, as the specific\naims and methods of such feminist projects differ widely, most\nimportantly in terms of how an analysis of sex and gender is impacted\nby other aspects of embodied experience such as race, sexuality, and\nability. This section first addresses some ways that continental\nfeminists trouble a mind-body distinction by engaging affect and\nemotion in their work. Next, it explores two examples of how\ncontinental traditions, psychoanalysis and phenomenology, are made\ninto critical resources in Continental feminist projects. Finally, it\npresents work that engages an ongoing critique of culture and everyday\nexperience as an important aspect of feminist theorizing. \nMany Continental feminists focus on the overlaying of mental and\nphysical experience via the concepts of affect, emotion, and feeling.\nAffect is described by Teresa Brennan as “the physiological\nshift accompanying a judgment” (Brennan 2004: 5). The\n“transmission of affect” describes the way that one can\ncatch the mood of another; this experience is “social in origin\nbut biological and physical in effect” (Brennan 2004: 3).\nBrennan describes transmission as when the “emotions or\naffects of one person, and the enhancing or depressing energies these\naffects entail” pass from one person to another (Brennan 2004:\n3). Affect is thus one way to describe how social experience impacts\nthe corporeal life of subjects through the transference of energy. In\nBrennan’s case, affective states are directional; they\nare not neutral but push or press on subjects. At the same time, terms\nlike affect and feeling might be distinguished based on the extent to\nwhich one considers affect to be already coded with or influenced by\nsocial significance for a subject (see Ahmed 2010: 230–231,\nSeigworth & Gregg 2010, esp. 5–8). \nContinental feminist projects on emotion often analyze historically\ncontextualized experiences. Ann Cvetkovich engages with trauma in a\nway that \nfocuses on the everyday and the insidious…and situates it in a\nsocial and cultural frame rather than a medical one. (Cvetkovich 2007:\n464) \nShe then presents a political account of depression that\ndepathologizes such negatively-connotated emotional experiences so\nthat they can become more visible in public and thus create a\npotential foundation for community (Cvetkovich 2007: 460). In The\nCultural Politics of Emotion, Sara Ahmed argues that emotion is\ngenerated when meaning is produced across social-political\ninteraction; these feelings create the boundaries of affinity groups\nand impact self-understanding. In this analysis, emotions help\nconstitute what a person understands as their objective condition, and\nthus \nemotions are not “in” either the individual or the social,\nbut produce the very surfaces and boundaries that allow all kinds of\nobjects to be delineated. (Ahmed 2004 [2014: 10]) \nBecause feeling is often ambivalent and multi-faceted, rather than in\nspite of this complexity, social critics who attend to how affects are\nemployed and manipulated in both textual and social-political\nargumentation can produce readings that trouble an easy dichotomy\nbetween what is a “good” and what a “bad”\nexperience. \nPsychoanalytically-informed projects use concepts such as trauma,\nmourning, melancholia, and abjection to analyze embodied experience\n(Irigaray 1974 [1985]; Spillers 1996; Butler 1997; Felman 2002; Oliver\n2004; entry on\n psychoanalytic feminism).\n They frequently engage aesthetics as an aspect of social critique\n(Chanter 2008; Kristeva 1980 [1982]; Miller 2014). This allows a\nsymptomatic reading of feeling to be interpreted back against the\nsocial order, as is seen in Judith Butler’s Frames of\nWar. In this text, Butler analyzes what makes a life grievable\nand argues that the questions of who appears as a human, whose life\nshould be protected, and who does not are all figured in advance of\nany particular political decision through a pre-reflexive manipulation\nof affect (Butler 2009 [2016: 64]). Supplementing democratic theory\nwith Continental feminist interpretations, Noëlle McAfee deploys\nKristeva and the resources in her thought, as well as psychoanalysis,\nspecifically on the issues of affect and the notion of the\n“political unconscious” (McAfee 2000 and 2008). \nCritical phenomenologists draw on the methods of phenomenology to\ndemonstrate “the multiple ways in which power moves through our\nbodies and our lives” (Introduction, Weiss, Murphy, &\nSalamon 2020: xiv). Lisa Guenther understands critical phenomenology\nas both a way of doing philosophy and a way of approaching political\nactivism (Guenther 2020: 15). Most characteristically, Guenther argues\nthat critical phenomenology employs reworked versions of \nMerleau-Ponty’s concept of the body schema to account for\ngendered and sexual schemas (Simone de Beauvoir, Iris Marion Young,\nTalia Mae Bettcher, Gayle Salamon), racialized schemas (Frantz Fanon,\nLewis Gordon, Sara Ahmed, George Yancy, Alia Al-Saji), disability\nschemas (Kay Toombs, Lisa Diedrich, Havi Carel), and other aspects of\nlived experience. (Guenther 2020: 13–14) \nA recent volume edited by Gail Weiss, Ann V, Murphy, and Gayle\nSalamon, entitled 50 Concepts for a Critical* Phenomenology\n(2020), shows that many of the central concepts of critical\nphenomenology intersect with Continental feminism. \nFinally, considering the social and political import of inner states\nand the centering of quotidian experiences of power enable Continental\nfeminists to explore culture as it develops. For instance, Shannon\nSullivan’s Good White People: The Problem with Middle-Class\nAnti-Racism focuses on “the personal side of whiteness and\nwhite privilege” with attention to the embodied experience of\nrace (S. Sullivan 2014: 19) to critique the ways through which white\nliberals set themselves up as altruistic, “good” white\npeople through, e.g., hypocritical modes of tolerance that maintain\nwhite domination (S. Sullivan 2014: 4). Robin James’\nResilience & Melancholy explores pop music as a way to\nanalyze the impact of neoliberal biopolitics; she combines music\ntheory with psychoanalytic and Foucauldian philosophies to critique\ncomplicity with multi-racial white supremacist patriarchy and argues\nthat music, e.g., Rihanna’s, offer strategies for countering\nthis oppressive power (R. James 2015). In Irony in the Age of\nEmpire: Comic Perspectives on Philosophy and Freedom, Cynthia\nWillett engages film and stand-up comedy to articulate a libidinal\nunderstanding of freedom that can counter the liberal paradigms of\nindividuality with a sense of freedom defined “in terms of\nequality and solidarity” (Willett 2008: 14). Erin Tarver\nanalyzes practices of sports fans, with particular attention to\nfootball, baseball, and basketball fans in the American South, to\nbetter understand how individual and group identities are maintained\nto “…shore up, reproduce, and very occasionally, subvert\nracial, sexual and gender hierarchies” (Tarver 2017: 3). This\nwork is often interdisciplinary, and some of these projects work at\nthe intersection between continental and pragmatist feminisms (see\nentry on\n intersections between pragmatist and continental feminism). \nSimultaneously reading carefully and irreverently, continental\nfeminists deepen the philosophical account of experience by\nintegrating historically contextualized feeling into their projects,\nusing and transmuting philosophical traditions and traditional\nfigures, and interrogating everyday experiences in their embodied and\ncultural specificity. This work insists that meaning and social order\nfunction through unrecognized cooptation, subordination or exclusion\nin various intersectional constellations. In general, continental\nfeminisms are less concerned with changing a woman’s place in a\nsymbolic or social system, and more focused on upending such systems,\nas will be explored in more detail in the following sections. \nThis section on the convergences between Black and Continental\nfeminist thought begins with a discussion about the history of Black\nfeminist scholarship utilizing existential/phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, critical, and hermeneutic approaches. It then\nintroduces intersectionality as the major heuristic for Black feminist\ntheorizing, and concludes by highlighting emerging areas and\nintersections between Black studies and Black feminist Continental\nthought. \nBlack women have long been contributors to the Continental\nphilosophical tradition. One may argue that their contributions to\nprofessional philosophy started after the graduation of the first\nBlack woman to earn the PhD in philosophy, Joyce Mitchell Cook, who\ncompleted the degree in 1965 from Princeton University. Even prior to\nthis date, however, Black women engaged in projects that we can\nrecognize as Continental feminist projects. Importantly, \nmany Black intellectuals in the United States going back (at least) to\nthe nineteenth century offered what are now described as existential,\nphenomenological, and/or genealogical analyses of race and racism.\n(Belle 2012, 329 fn. 1) \nThese contributions did not always occur in the form of traditional\nphilosophical discussions, nor are they always created by those who\nhave professional degrees in philosophy, which is certainly true of\nthe nineteenth and early twentieth century thinkers, Sojourner Truth,\nMaria W. Stewart, and\n Anna Julia Cooper. \nBlack feminists’ contributions to Continental philosophy\ndemonstrate the ways in which their voices are crucial to both shaping\nand expanding the discipline. Kathryn Sophia Belle, Donna-Dale\nMarcano, and Maria del Guadalupe Davidson edited Convergences:\nBlack Feminism and Continental Philosophy (del Guadalupe et al.\n2010), the only text at the publication of this entry that addresses\nboth these topics simultaneously. For the editors, the concept of\nconvergence is demonstrated by the natural, historical, and necessary\nengagement of Black women with Continental philosophy. Belle\nwrites, \nBlack feminist and womanist thinkers inevitably address the very same\nissues of agency, identity, alienation, power, and so on that are\nraised in much recent Continental philosophy. Likewise, from Immanuel\nKant to the feminist thinkers of the present, Continental philosophy\nhas engaged, to some extent, with issues of race and gender. (2010:\n5) \nThe Black feminist tradition in Continental philosophy demonstrates\nthat Black women are not strangers nor enemies of Continental\nphilosophy; rather, their unique theoretical positioning affords them\nthe opportunity to utilize, challenge, and expand the tradition. \nBlack feminist thinkers contribute to Continental feminist thought in\nat least two ways. First, they engage directly with Continental\nfigures and theories. For example, Lorraine Hansberry comments that\nSimone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex (1949, translated\nin 1953) was arguably the “most important work of this\ncentury” (1957 [1995: 129 and 133]), and Antillean thinker\nPaulette Nardal draws on both features of the Harlem Renaissance and\nexistentialist thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre to provide a\nphenomenological and genealogical account of how the Black race, and\nAntilleans in particular, have come to understand their own notion of\nrace consciousness in “The Awakening of Race\nConsciousness” (1932). More recently, they engage with canonical\nfigures and ideologies of Continental philosophy, as in the work of\nKathryn Sophia Belle on Hannah Arendt (2014) or Kris Sealey on\nEmmanuel Levinas (2014). Second, regardless of their professional\nPhilosophy degrees or lack thereof, Black feminist thinkers utilize\nthe tools of the Continental tradition as part of their\ninterdisciplinary approaches, as in the use of Foucault in the work of\nSylvia Wynter (2003) and the use of Freud, Lacan, and psychoanalysis\nin the work of Hortense Spillers (1996). \nBlack feminist thinkers have frequently used intersectionality as an\neffective entry-point into conversations with the Continental\ntradition. Intersectionality is a Black feminist theory that describes\nthe oppression that Black women experience as a result of lying at the\nnexus of simultaneously impactful identities, such as that of race,\ngender, class, and sexuality. As such, intersectionality can be used\nas a phenomenological tool to describe Black women’s lived\nexperience of oppression. While legal theorist Kimberlé\nCrenshaw coined the term in 1989, the theory has been articulated at\nleast since the mid-nineteenth century in Sojourner Truth’s\nproclamation, “Ain’t I a Woman?” (1851). In the\nspeech, Truth highlights that Black women are treated with less\nrespect than white women while bearing the same burdens of racism as\nBlack men. Anna Julia Cooper wrote that Black women are \nconfronted by a both a woman question and a race problem and is as yet\nan unknown or an unacknowledged factor in both. (1892 [1988: 134]) \nIn their collective statement from April 1977, The Combahee River\nCollective argues that \nBlack feminism [is] the logical political movement to combat the\nmanifold and simultaneous oppressions that all women of color face \nand that \n[t]here is also undeniably a personal genesis for Black feminism, that\nis, the political realization that comes from the seemingly personal\nexperiences of individual Black women’s lives. (Taylor 2017: 15\nand 17) \nIntersectionality is thus a hallmark of Black feminist thought because\nit prioritizes the lived experiences of Black women. In doing so, it\nsupplies the tools to think about the extent to which one’s\nconsciousness the world is informed by experiences of racism, sexism,\nclassism, and homophobia. \nIn addition to its utility in explaining Black women’s lived\nexperience, intersectionality also provides tools for Black feminists\nto critique the presumed whiteness and bourgeois-class status of\nfeminism and to combat various forms of oppression and violence. Thus,\nintersectionality is also key to critiquing phenomenological analysis,\nthat is, analysis of lived experiences and feminist movements through\nthe lens of sociopolitical identities such as race, sex, and class.\nAngela Davis’s text Women, Race, & Class (1981) is\nan early model of this approach; it details the history of U.S.\nwomen’s movements and their consideration, or lack thereof, of\nthe class-based and racial dimensions of womanhood. Texts such as\nPatricia Hill-Collins’s Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge,\nConsciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment (1990 [2015]) underscore\nthe ways in which Black women create their own epistemological\nstandpoint as a result of their lived experiences. In the 1970s to\n90s, when Black women’s contributions to academia reached its\nzenith, Black feminist scholars such as Barbara Christian in\n“The Race for Theory” (1988), Toni Morrison in Playing\nin the Dark (1992), and Audre Lorde in “The Master’s\nTools will Never Dismantle the Master’s House” (1984a) and\n“Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference”\n(1984b) exemplified Black women’s critiques of theoretical\napproaches that adopt a “neutral” stance toward feminist\nmovements where neutral meant presuming all women to be white,\nmiddle-class, young or middle-aged, and heterosexual (see also Hull,\nBell-Scott, & Smith 1982). \nCurrent Black feminist work centers Black epistemologies,\npractices, and concepts. The burgeoning scholarship of Black women\nphilosophers continue to push the boundaries of Continental feminism,\nas in the work of Lindsey Stewart’s work on Black feminist\npractices of freedom (2017), Camisha Russell’s work on the\nissues of race and gender in assisted reproduction (2018), and Axelle\nKarera’s work, which focuses on the Anthropocene and\nantiBlackness (2019). In addition to engaging with the canonical\nfigures of the Continental tradition, Black thinkers harvest\nphilosophy from their own perspective and experience of the world as\nwell as their theoretical archives. Much of this more recent work\nintersects with Black Studies. The work of Black thinkers from\ndisciplines other than philosophy are intersecting with Continental\nphilosophical and feminist approaches, as seen in the works of such as\nSaidiya Hartman (1997, 2007, and 2019), Christina Sharpe (2016),\nRizvana Bradley (2014 and 2018), Jennifer Nash (2019), Denise Ferreira\nda Silva (2007, 2014, and 2018), Riley Snorton (2017), Selamawit\nTerrefe (2020), and Zakiyyah Iman Jackson (2020). \nContinental feminist approaches to questions on colonialism revolve\naround two main sets of investigations: on the one hand, the\ninterrogation of the hegemony of the West as an abstract category that\nis deployed strategically to exclude and inferiorize communities\ndeemed Non-Western (Spivak 1999; Narayan 1997; Mohanty 1984), and on\nthe other hand, the question of coloniality, which focuses on the\npolitical and epistemic ordering of the globe starting with the\ncolonization of the Americas (Lugones 2003; Wynter 1995; Ortega 2016).\nTo this end, these approaches both use schemas of the Continental\ntradition (such as phenomenology, psychoanalysis, genealogy,\ndeconstruction, and poststructuralism) and call into question the\ngeographic and racial assumptions that underlie Continental\nphilosophy. For both of these approaches, an analysis of colonialism\nis inseparable from the political aim of challenging and undoing the\ncolonial world. This challenge entails deconstructing the categories\nof the colonially determined globe (such as East-West,\nWestern-Non-Western, Developed-Underdeveloped, First World-Third\nWorld, North-South) through focusing on the concrete lived experiences\nof individuals and communities. This section focuses on the general\ncharacteristics of these two Continental feminist approaches taken up\nunder the rough categories of postcolonial and decolonial feminisms,\nwith the former focusing on the Western-Non-western divide that marks\ncolonial relations, and the latter on the North-South dialogues that\nemerge within the relations of coloniality. It concludes by\nhighlighting coalitional thinking, a fundamental aspect of both post-\nand decolonial feminist approaches. \nPostcolonial feminist approaches maintain that in order to interrogate\nthe hegemony of the West, it is necessary to deconstruct the ways in\nwhich it is deployed to exclude the non-Western subject. Furthermore,\nsuch deployment is always a strategic one, insofar as the\n“West” is not a concrete geographical category, and the\nparadigm of Western subjectivity is continuously built by demarcating\nthose who do not fit in it. Postcolonial feminisms are\ninterdisciplinary and not limited to the field of philosophy, and they\nchallenge the inscription of the gender, racial, and geographic\ncategories that underlie the hegemony of the Western subject. In doing\nso, Continental feminist approaches engage with figures from\npoststructuralism and critical theory (such as Foucault, Derrida,\nDeleuze and Adorno), and they deploy methods such as genealogy and\ndeconstruction (Spivak 1988; Mohanty 1984), in order to question the\nunderlying geographic and gendered assumptions of these methods. In\n“Can the Subaltern Speak?” for example, Gayatri\nChakravorty Spivak engages with French poststructuralism and questions\nthe paradigms of speech/reason that deny the very possibility of\ncapacities such as resistance for those that do not fit within the\ngeographic, racialized, and gendered boundaries of Western\nSubjectivity (Spivak 1988). In doing so, she highlights the ways in\nwhich poststructuralism relies upon the very categories (of speech,\nreason, or universal subjectivity) that it ostensibly critiques. \nThe tension highlighted by Spivak, in which the Western Subject\nconstitutes both the dominant subject and the only subject capable of\nresistance, underlies postcolonial feminisms’ critique of the\nalignment of the West with modernity and progress (McClintock 1995;\nStoler 1995). Chandra Talpade Mohanty, in “Under Western\nEyes”, criticizes the hegemony of Western approaches in defining\nthe scope and goals of feminist struggles. Issues such as the veil\ndebate, in this sense, point to the political and phenomenological\nracialization of the Non-Western woman (Al-Saji 2010; Sheth 2006). At\nthe same time, Uma Narayan draws attention to the risks of fetishizing\nthe category of the Non-Western and highlights how such a\nfetishization remains within colonially determined divisions (Narayan\n1997; Narayan & Harding 2000). Namita Goswami, in Subjects\nThat Matter, develops heterogeneity as a kind of conceptual\ncontinuity between feminism, philosophy, and postcolonial studies,\nwhich allows for an understanding of difference beyond oppositional\nand antagonistic terms (Goswami 2019). \nDecolonial feminisms emerge primarily from the U.S. Latina and Latinx\ncontexts and have a different genealogy, insofar as they are in\ndialogue with Latin American Philosophy, Continental Philosophy,\nAnglo-American Thought, and especially U.S. Women of Color feminisms.\nFocusing on North-South dialogues, Latin American and Latina Feminist\nphilosophers such as Ofelia Schutte engage with the work of figures\nsuch as Nietzsche, Kristeva, and Irigaray while developing Latin\nAmerican philosophy as a field in U.S. academic philosophy (Schutte\n1984; 1993; for more, see the entry on\n Latin American feminism).\n Linda Martín Alcoff, for example, brings Latin American\nPhilosophy (particularly the work of Enrique Dussel) in dialogue with\nexistentialism and poststructuralism in order to develop the framework\nfor Latinx feminisms (Alcoff 2006, 2015). \nOne of the major frameworks of decolonial feminisms is “the\ncoloniality of power”, a term first introduced by Aníbal\nQuijano, and defined as “the social classification of the\nworld’s population around the idea of race” (Quijano 2000:\n1). In this sense, the colonization of the Americas is not only a\nhistorical moment, but also the emergence of race and the subsequent\nreorganization of the globe in accordance with what Walter Mignolo\ncalls “the colonial difference”, denoting the abstract\npositioning of Europe as the global hegemonic power (Mignolo 2002).\nDecolonial feminisms take an intersectional approach to the\ncoloniality of power and investigate, as María Lugones says,\n“the emergence of hegemonic gender arrangements along\n‘racial’ lines” starting with the colonization of\nthe Americas (Lugones 2007: 190). Decolonial feminists such as Lugones\nand Wynter bring poststructuralist critique in dialogue with Latin\nAmerican philosophy and argue that dominant gender arrangements\nthemselves are colonial; these arrangements, such as patriarchy,\nheterosexualism, or gender dimorphism mark concrete historical\nprocesses of the racial inscription of gender norms, starting from and\nwith the coloniality of power (Lugones 2008; Oyěwùmí\n2007; Wynter 2006). \nDecolonial feminisms’ emphasis on historical critique is\ninseparable from a concern with the concrete lived experiences of\nwomen of color (Moraga and Anzaldúa 1981 [2015]; Pérez\n1999; Lugones 2007, Sandoval 2000). Gloria Anzaldúa, in\nBorderlands/La Frontera, emphasizes bordered thinking as the\nunderlying logic of contemporary systems of oppression, and she\nformulates the resistances of hybrid identities that emerge both out\nof and in response to such bordered thinking (Anzaldúa 1987).\nMariana Ortega develops Latina feminist phenomenology in emphasizing\nboth the lived experience of borderlands and exile, and the\npossibilities of resistance by developing “home-tactics”\nin and through these experiences (Ortega 2016). \nCoalitional thinking is a fundamental aspect of both post- and\ndecolonial feminist approaches. Mohanty calls for coalitions across\nborders in thinking through the concrete lived experiences and\nemphasizes the importance of situated and local struggles in\nunderstanding hegemonic power relations.  Moraga and Anzaldúa,\nin their coedited collection This Bridge Called My Back, call\nfor concrete and sustained coalitions that are based on an\nintersectional understanding of women’s lives, rather than\nabstract calls for sisterhood. Decolonial feminists such as Lugones,\nChela Sandoval, Ortega, and Emma Pérez, maintain that\ncoalitional thinking cannot be an afterthought for any anti- or\ndecolonial struggles (Pérez 1999; Sandoval 2000). \nAs Continental feminism expands, it involves further conversations\nwith and in-between these approaches. The questions around the\n“continent” of Continental feminism, as well as how such a\ncontinent is situated within the colonial geographic boundaries of the\nWest and the Global North, continue to be challenged. As spaces for\nsuch a flow of ideas open up, further conversations on the possibility\nof coalition, as well as on challenging the limits of colonial thought\ncontinue to reshape the face of Continental feminism. \nThe relationship between Continental feminism and queer theory is\nsimultaneously productive and fraught. While far from exhaustive, this\nentry will first highlight some of the overlapping figures and\napproaches between the two fields, including examples of scholarship\nat their intersections. It will then briefly introduce one account of\nthe tension between them. Finally, it will close with some reflections\non the shared problems across these fields, including their\nhistorically white and Anglo-Eurocentric approaches, as well as how\nrecent work in queer of color critique aligns with and points to new\ndirections in Continental feminism. \nIn the late 1980s and the early 1990s, “queer” emerged as\na reclamation of a homophobic slur and a rallying cry for a coalition\nof the marginalized against the tyranny of the normal (Barker &\nScheele 2016; D. Hall & Jagose 2012; Warner 1993; Sedgwick 1993;\nAnzaldúa 1991 [2009]). Formed in the crucible of the AIDS\ncrisis, which sharpened the need to understand the violence\nexperienced by people excluded by norms related to gender and\nsexuality, “queer” was meant to bring attention to the\nrange of sexual/gender practices deemed outside the purview of the\nnormal. In one genealogy of queer theory, the field develops this\nearly activist reclamation of the term queer into a wide-reaching\ncritique of how norms operate in and through dominant\nconceptualizations of identity. Given this motivating impulse of\ndeconstruction, or of denaturalizing categories such as sexuality, it\nis perhaps of no surprise that queer theory has historically been a\nfield well-populated with figures (e.g., Lacan, Foucault, Derrida) and\nmethodological approaches (poststructuralism, psychoanalysis,\nphenomenology) that have been associated with Continental philosophy,\nespecially twentieth century European philosophy. \nQueer theory frequently draws on, critiques, and expands the ideas of\nmany figures and approaches that are seen as early progenitors of\nContinental feminism (e.g., Beauvoir, Irigaray, Kristeva, feminist\nphenomenology, feminist poststructuralism, critical theory,\npsychoanalytic theory). As Jagose (2009) points out, however, the\ncritique of normative identity categories was not invented by queer\ntheory, given that feminist scholarship has a rich history of\nradically disrupting the category of women along lines of race and\nsexuality. Moreover, the lines between feminism and queer theory are\nhistorically blurred. For example, Judith Butler—who is often\ncited as an originator of queer theory—explicitly marks her\nearly work as occurring in the intersection of these fields (as well\nas a number of other critical discourses) (1997). In Gender\nTrouble (1990) and Bodies that Matter (1993), Butler\ndraws on Continental feminist figures such as Irigaray, Beauvoir, and\nKristeva, and methods ranging from psychoanalysis to poststructuralism\nand phenomenology to develop a simultaneously queer and feminist\ntheoretical lens focused on understanding the relationship between\ngender and sexuality, as well as the operation of norms and identity\ncategories more broadly (Salih 2002). \nA second major figure in the relationship between Continental feminism\nand queer theory is Michel Foucault, who has been extensively used in\nboth queer and Continental (and specifically poststructuralist)\nfeminist theory, but who (as opposed to Butler) did not explicitly use\nthe terms queer and feminist. While a larger account of the connection\nbetween Foucault and queer theory is beyond the scope of this entry,\nthe relationship is a rich one. In the late 1980s, Foucault’s\nThe History of Sexuality, Volume One was read\nheavily by activists and scholars questioning dominant narratives\naround sexuality and identity (Halperin 1995); Foucault’s work\nwas also influential not only for Judith Butler’s Gender\nTrouble (1990) but also for another text often cited as\nfoundational for queer theory, Eve Sedgwick’s Epistemology\nof the Closet (1990 [2008]). \nFoucault’s genealogical approach to identity, including his\nexploration of the histories and models of power at work in modern\nconceptions of sexuality, has been important for a number of\ncontemporary scholars working at the intersections of feminism and\nqueer theory (Huffer 2010 and 2020; Russell 2010; Sawicki 2005;\nSchotten 2018; Winnubst 2006). For example, Ladelle McWhorter (1999)\ntakes up Foucault’s account of ethics as a practice of the self,\nor how we work on ourselves to become particular kinds of people,\nthrough a queer framework that resists expected developmental\ntrajectories and normative timelines of a life (e.g., heterosexual\ncoupling resulting in marriage and children). And in a different vein,\nJasbir Puar (2007) has drawn on Foucault’s theories of power (as\nwell as a wide range of interdisciplinary theory including\npostcolonial feminist theory) to analyze the relationship between\ncontemporary biopower and homonationalism, or how certain\n“good” gay and lesbian subjects, by aligning themselves\nwith U.S. imperialism, are welcomed into the nation-state. \nFigures associated with Continental feminism who do not necessarily\nmark themselves or their work as queer have also been used in queer\ntheoretical projects, just as feminists have historically done with\nany number of non-feminist philosophers. For example, queer studies\nscholars have explored the relative absence of Irigaray in queer\ntheory, argued for the queer resources of her thinking (Huffer 2013;\nWinnubst 2006), called attention to the potential use of\nIrigaray’s disruption of binaries for queer analyses of identity\n(Butler 1993: 36–39; Grosz 1989), and used Irigarayan concepts\nto develop queer analyses of longstanding feminist issues, such as the\nexperience of breast feeding (R. Lee 2018). \nPhenomenological methods can also track this traffic between\nContinental feminism and queer theory. For example, Sara Ahmed’s\nQueer Phenomenology (2006) explores the use of phenomenology\nin queer studies by asking, among other questions, how to understand\nthe “orientation” of sexual orientation as the way bodies\nare directed towards particular objects and away from others. In\ndeveloping this queer use of phenomenology, Ahmed acknowledges her\ndebt to feminist philosophers of the body such as Sandra Bartky, Iris\nMarion Young, Rosalyn Diprose, and Gail Weiss, as well as early\nphenomenologists such as de Beauvoir and phenomenologists of race\nincluding Linda Alcoff, Frantz Fanon, and Lewis Gordon. \nGiven these examples of the overlap of figures and approaches in\nContinental feminism and queer theory, it is worth asking what\ndistinguishes the approaches. One may be tempted to say that feminism\nfocuses more on gender (historically, within continental feminism,\nthis may be more commonly discussed as sexual difference) and queer\ntheory focuses more on sexuality (including questions of pleasure,\ndesire, and eroticism). Yet many working within Continental feminism,\nespecially as inflected with French theory, also focus on questions\nrelated to sexuality such as pleasure, desire, and eroticism. And\nthere are also reasons to be suspicious of how the gender-sexuality\nsplit is narrated as a feminist-queer split. While some have argued\nthat there are good reasons to draw distinctions between these fields\nin order to do justice to their distinct concerns (G. Rubin 2011;\nHalley 2006), there have also been many challenges to overly\nprogrammatic forms of this separation (Huffer 2013) and accounts of\nhow this narrative can overlook the field’s mutual interest in\nunderstanding the complex relationship between gender and sexuality,\nas well as the possibility of a queer feminism (Jagose 2009).\nNevertheless, despite the overlaps in figures and archives, as well as\nthe wealth of resources in queer theory on topics that Continental\nfeminist philosophers hold dear (temporality, embodiment, identity,\nand desire, to name only a few), the relatively slow uptake of texts\nmarked explicitly as queer theory has been noticeable (Winnubst 2010).\nThis is not to erase the important work done at the intersections of\nthese fields but to acknowledge that the relationship is not a\nseamless one. In their introductory comments to a “Roundtable on\nContinental Feminism”, Lynne Huffer and Shannon Winnubst (2017)\nnote the relative lack of engagement with queer theory among the\ncontributions, and they ask whether Continental feminism is capacious\nenough to embrace queer theory, a question that has also been posed to\nphilosophy more broadly (Ahmed 2016b; Salamon 2009; Winnubst\n2010). \nFinally, both Continental feminism and queer theory have also been\nextensively critiqued for the whiteness and Anglo-Eurocentric nature\nof their archives. In one particularly well-known rendition of this\ncritique, Cathy Cohen asks whether queer theory has lived up to its\nanti-identitarian promise of creating coalitions across difference\n(2005). As a way to intervene in the whiteness of queer theory\n(Johnson and Henderson 2005), Roderick Ferguson (2004) coined the\nterm “queer of color critique” to describe how various\nintersections of race, gender, sexuality, and class operate in\nnationalistic discourses of identity and belonging; it is, in\nFerguson’s words, \na heterogenous enterprise made up of women of color feminism,\nmaterialist analysis, poststructuralist theory, and queer critique.\n(Ferguson 2004: 149) \nOther notable and early contributors to this sub-field include\nJosé Muñoz, E. Patrick Johnson, Chandan Reddy, and\nGayatri Gopinath. Although the topics at work in queer of color\ncritique concerning identity, embodiment, temporality, and affect have\nalso been topics of central interests to Continental feminists, the\nuptake of queer of color critique, as with queer theory, has been slow\nin Continental feminism. However, as Continental feminism\nexpands—as shown through this entry— the resources of\nqueer theory and queer of color critique are waiting in the wings as\ncrucial, if at times under acknowledged, interlocutors. \nLike Continental feminism, queer theory and queer of color critique\ncontinue the longstanding feminist tradition of sending texts and\nideas in directions they were perhaps never intended to travel. Recent\ntrajectories at the crossroads of Continental feminism and queer\nstudies include attention to neoliberal capitalism (Winnubst 2015;\nMcWhorter 2012), sex and gender in ancient Greek metaphysics (Bianchi\n2014); critical disability theory (Puar 2017; K. Hall 2014; Yergeau\n2018; and Gallop 2019), Latina feminism and existential phenomenology\n(Ortega 2016), affect and temporality (Ahmed 2019; Amin 2017; Freeman\n2019), and materialism and concepts of agency (Chen 2012). As explored\nin the next section, another important interlocutor with both\nContinental feminism and queer theory is transgender studies. \nA number of scholars have noted the complex interplay of shared and\ndistinct concerns between trans, feminist, and queer frameworks\n(Namaste 1996 and 2009; Prosser 1998; Heyes 2003; Salamon 2010a;\nStryker 2004). Emerging in the 1990s as a distinct field of academic\ninquiry, trans studies shares many of the intellectual roots of queer\ntheory yet also departs from queer studies through its explicit focus\non trans experience, including both non-monolithic nature of that\nexperience and the importance of trans people speaking for themselves\nabout their own lives. Likewise, while many of the theoretical\nframeworks and figures at the heart of Continental feminism are\npresent in trans studies (e.g., post-structuralism, phenomenology,\nFoucauldian genealogy, materialism), there have also been important\ncritiques of how Continental feminist approaches can ignore or\nsideline trans experience. Significantly, many of the philosophers\nworking in Continental feminism and trans studies cited in this entry\ncross inter- and intra-disciplinary boundaries. \nIn exploring the relationship between Continental feminist and trans\nstudies, it is crucial to acknowledge the forms that transphobia and\ntrans-exclusionary gestures can assume in feminist discourse more\ngenerally. For an extended overview of this history, see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on trans issues.\n The entry explains points of terminology (trans, transgender, trans*,\ntranssexual), as well as the historical emergence of transgender\nstudies and the broader (i.e., non-Continental specific) relationship\nbetween feminist and trans issues. \nIn one widely recognized form of feminist transphobia (found in the\nwork of trans-exclusionary radical feminists such as Janice Raymond),\ntrans women are portrayed as not “real” women and as\nthreats to feminist movements (Bettcher 2006, 2007; McKinnon 2018).\nHowever, there is another strand of feminist theory that has a\ndistinct relationship to trans issues, and (importantly for present\npurposes) it is a lineage of feminism that draws heavily on\nContinental figures such as Butler. While there is no doubt that\nButler’s work has been foundational in trans studies as well as\nin queer theory (Gerdes 2014; Salah 2007), it is also the case that\nher work has been critiqued for its selective use of trans experience\n(Prosser 1998; Namaste 1996; H. Rubin 1998). Critics point out that\ntrans identity tends be affirmed in Butlerian queer feminist discourse\nwhen it can be used to demonstrate the actual constructedness of\ngender, or its lack of ontological necessity, but also that some trans\nidentity is portrayed as problematically essentialist when accompanied\nby claims to “really be” a man or a woman and/or demands\nfor medical transition (Valentine 2012). While Prosser and Rubin both\ncritique this rejection of claims to gender realness from a\nphenomenological perspective (and Prosser (1998) from a psychoanalytic\nframework as well), Namaste (1996) focuses on the institutional\nreality of gender that is often sidelined in these debates. In\nresponse, Jack Halberstam has argued that, while Prosser’s\nfrustration with a selective use of trans identity in queer and\nfeminist theory is understandable, there are still significant\nproblems with the normativity inherent in the idea of gendered\nrealness (2005). \nNotably, the proliferation of non-trans feminist writers working on\ntrans issues in the 1990s led to Jacob Hale’s “Suggested\nRules for Non-Transsexuals Writing about Transsexuals, Transsexuality,\nTranssexualism, or Trans” (1997\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n Significant non-trans feminist analyses, following Hale and the\nemergence of transgender studies, include work by Cressida Heyes\n(2003) and Naomi Scheman (1996, 2016), both of whom articulate\ntheoretical bases for solidarity between cis and trans feminists.\nThere are also important instances of cis feminist theorists bringing\ntrans issues directly into their own work as serious interlocutors,\nrather than as thought experiments (Ahmed 2016b; Colebrook 2015;\nShotwell & Sangrey 2008) and collaborating with trans theorists\n(Heyes & Latham 2018). The term “cis” itself has also\nreceived more scholarly attention in the last two decades (Aultman\n2014). While the original intention behind the term was to\ndenaturalize non-trans subject positions, not all scholars agree that\nthe term successfully destabilizes gender norms, particularly insofar\nas such norms are racialized (Enke 2012b). \nMore recently, there have been many new trajectories established at\nthe crossroads of Continental and trans approaches to gender. A number\nof philosophers have written at the intersections of phenomenology and\ntrans studies, particularly in critical phenomenology, which\nemphasizes questions of oppression and power in examining how things\nappear to us in the world (Weiss, Murphy, & Salamon 2020). Ephraim\nDas Janssen uses phenomenology, including the work of Martin\nHeidegger, to examine what transgender experience tells us about\ngender (2017). Megan Burke (2019) takes up Beauvoirian concepts to\nexplore androgyny, trans identity, and agender experience. Gayle\nSalamon draws on the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to develop a\nphenomenology of transphobia in The Life and Death of Latisha\nKing (2018a). Salamon merges a tradition of earlier work in\nphenomenology and trans studies (H. Rubin 1998; Prosser 1998) with\ncritical phenomenology. Tamsin Kimoto (2018) has also used both\nMerleau-Ponty and Frantz Fanon to explore hormonal transition and\ntransphobia. \nAlong similar lines, new work in psychoanalysis and trans studies is\nalso revising longstanding psychoanalytic approaches to sex and\ngender, including coercive and pathologizing theories of trans\nsubjectivity (Elliot 2014), and is using resources in psychoanalysis\nto theorize trans experiences from a less pathologizing perspective\n(Breslow 2017; Carlson 2010; Coffman 2017; Cavanagh 2010). For\nexample, Amy Ray Stewart uses Julia Kristeva’s concept of\n“intimate revolt” to illuminate trans and queer\nexperiences of psychic life (2017). Patricia Gherovici (2017) has\nwritten about trans phenomena and the need to revise psychoanalytic\nconcepts using Lacanian theory and her own clinical experience working\nwith trans people. Relying on both psychoanalytic and phenomenological\nframeworks, Salamon (2010a) has also defended Butler’s account\nof gender against the aforementioned critiques of its treatment of\ntrans experience and developed her own psychoanalytic and\nphenomenological account of a dissonance between a felt sense of\ngender and an external appearance of a body that is attuned to trans\nexperience. \nThere is also a body of work emerging that puts foundational figures\nin Continental feminism into conversation with trans studies. Marie\nDraz (2018) has placed feminist philosophical uses of Nietzsche, such\nas in the work of Butler (1990) and Rosalyn Diprose (2002), into\nconversation with trans scholarship on the institutionalization of\ngender categories, while Tim Johnston (2015) has argued that although\nscholars of gender and sexuality have used Irigarayan resources for\ndiscussing trans and queer issues, Irigaray’s own claim that\nontology is sexed and that there is an impassable limit between the\nsexes conveys an unsalvageable cissexism, or privileging of non-trans\nexperience. In a similar vein, Oli Stephano (2019) critiques Elizabeth\nGrosz’s emphasis on the irreducibility of sexual difference,\nshowing that her ontology invalidates trans embodiment and\nsubjectivities. This critique of Grosz follows earlier work by Eva\nHayward (2017) on the transphobic implications of some of\nGrosz’s feminist materialist arguments. Gayle Salamon also\ncritically examines the way that sexual difference operates as a limit\nto the reimagining of embodiment and materiality in the work of both\nIrigaray and Grosz (Salamon 2010a). María Lugones is another\nfigure of widespread use in Continental feminism who has been\nregularly cited in scholarship on trans issues (Bettcher 2014b;\nDiPietro 2019; Draz 2017a; Malatino 2019). Finally, like Butler, the\nuse of Foucault in trans studies has also changed dramatically over\nthe last several decades. For example, Foucault’s work on types\nof modern power has been used (alongside women of color feminism,\nindigenous scholarship, and numerous other sources) to examine the\nviolence caused by how state institutions administer legal gender\ncategories in sex-segregated institutions and identity documents\n(Spade 2011 [2015]). Foucauldian feminist accounts of prison and\npunishment have also been put into conversation with scholarship\nrooted in trans and gender non-conforming experience (Dilts 2017;\nVitulli 2018; Zurn 2016, 2019). \nTrans studies continues, in different veins, many of the foundational\nquestions of Continental feminism by bringing the tools of Continental\nphilosophy to bear on questions of sex, gender, and sexuality, and\nvice versa, and it continually orients these conversations in new\ndirections. Much of this work is informed by other areas of critical\ntheory (e.g., critical race theory and decolonial theory) and pushes\nthe traditional boundaries of Continental feminism. Recent scholarship\non blackness and trans history, for example, has articulated the\nimportance of developing frameworks capable of understanding the\ndimensions of racialized gender historically and today (Snorton 2017)\nand work on migration and Latinx trans people has highlighted the need\nto attend to both the limits of our political theory and the\nproductive capacities of trans people of color for generating new\nworlds (Pitts 2018). Current conversations about the relationship\nbetween Continental feminism and trans studies must also involve\nattention to the material conditions of the academy itself, as the\ngrowing attention to trans experience in philosophy more broadly has\nnot resulted in more trans voices and trans academics (Bettcher 2018\n(Other Internet Resources); Marvin 2019, 2020). Future directions in\nContinental feminism and trans studies will need to be attentive not\nonly to the intriguing philosophical questions occurring in these\nconversations, but also to the specific contours of the material\nconditions that allow trans scholarship to flourish. \nThis section explores the relationship between Continental feminism\nand Asian American feminist thought, both the tensions between the two\nas well as new directions that this relation brings to Continental\nfeminism. A major point of convergence between the two fields is the\nfocus on lived experience of Asian American women. This section begins\nby discussing the hypervisibility that Asian American women experience\ndue to the specific forms of oppression that they face, namely,\norientalization and the Model Minority myth. It then highlights the\nparadoxical form of invisibility that Asian American feminist\nphenomenologist trace in their body of work. Next, this section\nconsiders the historical position of Asian American women in\ncoalitional feminist projects, especially focusing on the ways in\nwhich Asian American women have been relegated to a\n“tag-along” group. Finally, this section will highlight\nrecent scholarship in Continental feminism that engages with Asian\nAmerican feminist theory and draws upon both Eastern and Western\ntraditions. \nIt must be noted from the outset that “Asian” is an\nexceptionally broad term, and the peoples that are considered\nAsian/Asian American have often changed throughout history. In\naccordance with anthologies by Asian American women that respond to\nthis very issue, this section addresses the identities of women who\ntrace their roots back to East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian\nsubcontinent (Asian Women United of California 1989; The Women of\nSouth Asian Descent Collective 1993). \nIn This Bridge Called My Back (Moraga & Anzaldúa\n1981 [2015]), Asian American thinkers such as Genny Lim, Merle Woo, Nellie\nWong, and Mitsuye Yamada established their positions in feminist\ntheorizing by exploring their own perspectives on topics surrounding\ngendered identity, sexuality, silencing, the feeling of not-belonging,\nand living against stereotypes of Asian American women as docile,\nquiet, agreeable, and submissive. Similarly, in This Bridge We\nCall Home (Anzaldúa & Keating 2002), Minh-ha T. Pham,\nShirley Geok-Lin Lim, and Jid Lee theorize from the specific\nexperiences that they face as Asian American immigrant women, such as\nexploring a connection to an Asian mother who emigrated to the United\nStates, navigating the cultural connection they still hold to a land\nthat they may have never visited, and living in the face of the Model\nMinority myth while also subverting the stereotype. Writings that\ncenter the perspective of the Asian American and diasporic Asian woman\nare essential for Asian American feminist theorizing, for, as Sonia\nShah emphasized, \n[a]n Asian American feminist movement is the only movement\nthat will consistently represent Asian American women’s\ninterests. (1998: xix) \nTwo early anthologies were very important for the formation of Asian\nAmerican feminism: Making Waves (Asian Women United of\nCalifornia [AWUC] 1989) and The Forbidden Stitch (Lim &\nTsutakawa 1989); they both include writings from different ethnic and\nnational backgrounds, specifically Chinese, Japanese, Filipino,\nKorean, Vietnamese, and Indian (Hill-Collins & Bilge 2016: 73). In\na recent volume entitled Asian American Feminisms and Women of\nColor Politics, editors Lynn Fujiwara and Shireen Roshanravan\npresent a series of articles emerging at the intersection of Asian\nAmerican feminist engagement with Women of Color coalition politics,\norganizing around concepts, methods, and epistemic principles central\nto Women of Color feminist scholarship (Fujiwara & Roshanravan\n2018) \nHypervisibility of Asian American women is a central issue in most\nAsian American feminist projects. Some Asian American feminist\ntheorists, such as Robin Zheng, argue that Asian American women are\nhypervisible because they are hypersexualized, orientalized, and\nexoticized. Robin Zheng (2016) discusses the complexities of\nhypervisibility “Why Yellow Fever Isn’t Flattering: A Case\nAgainst Racial Fetishes”. Zheng argues that there is little\ndifference between what is known as “yellow fever”, the\nracial fetishization and preference of Asian women and men, and what\nshe calls the “Mere Preference Argument”, which attempts\nto claim that there is nothing morally wrong with preferring certain\nracialized phenotypic traits; as she shows, despite the origin of a\nracialized fetish, both yellow fever and other racialized fetishes\n“depersonalize and otherize” their subjects (2016: 412).\nZheng shows that these fetishes are not just harmless personal\npreferences, but a set of practices and thought patterns that result\nin negative social impacts for Asian American women. Relatedly, Asian\nAmerican women are also hypervisible due to the “Model Minority\nmyth”, that is, the myth that asserts that Asian Americans are\nuniquely hard-working and thus, the ideal “model”\nminority, especially in contrast with other minority groups. This myth\nmakes Asian American women hypervisible by making them a part of a\ngroup of people who are defined by their ability to achieve upward\nclass mobility (K. Lee 2014). \nParadoxically, Asian American women are also rendered invisible in\nvarious feminist movements and discourses. Asian American feminist\ndiscussions on invisibility differ from other discussions within\nContinental feminism on visibility and feminine erasure due to their\ndual existence as both invisible subjects and hypervisible\nrepresentations of stereotypes. Poet and activist Mitsuye Yamada\nstates that Asian American women are “the visible minority that\nis invisible” (1981b). Yamada means this claim in two ways:\nfirst, in regard to how Asian American women are rendered invisible in\nconversations surrounding women of color oppressions; and second, in\nregard to how the oppressions experienced by Asian American women are\noften invisible to themselves. In order to carve out a space for\nthemselves in feminist theorizing, Asian American women in this book\nshared their stories that demonstrate the struggle of becoming visible\nto oneself while existing in a world that constantly demands\none’s invisibility. Yamada’s explains how she was\ninvisible to herself because she practiced passive resistance while\nbelieving that others did not see her as the stereotype of an Asian\nAmerican women. In order to become visible to herself and others, she\nrealized that she must act in ways, such as displaying anger in\nresponse to sexist and racist acts, that an oppressive gaze would\nclaim was “uncharacteristic” of her as an Asian American\nwoman (1981b: 40). At the same time, the Model Minority myth can also\nparadoxically render Asian American women invisible by making them\nhypervisible as successful paradigms that are perceived as lacking\nexperiences of oppression and violence and thus have no credibility to\nspeak to these lived experiences. \nAs a result of this specific form of invisibility, Asian American\nfeminists proposed new methods of political organization in order to\ninclude the voices of Asian American women in feminist coalitions. The\nsimilarities between writings that span nearly two decades gesture to\none of the many issues faced by Asian American feminism: Asian\nAmerican feminists have often been seen, and arguably still are seen,\nas a group in the background that is simply, as Yamada described,\n“tagging along” in feminist theorization against\noppressions (1981b: 40). In other words, Asian American women are\noften seen as individuals who do not often experience oppressions that\nare specific to their own identities and, therefore, have no place in\nfighting oppression. In response to this, we can see activists such as\nGrace Lee Boggs, who have worked closely with other people of color in\nthe fight against different oppressions (Boggs & Boggs 1974; 1998\n[2016]; Boggs & Kurashige 2011); Lisa Lowe’s essay on\nheterogeneity, hybridity, and multipolicy of Asian American\nwomen’s experiences (Lowe 1991); and more recent Asian American\nfeminist projects that include Asian Americans women in liberatory\nprojects in a manner that does not simply relegate them to tag-along\npositions (Shah 1998; Fujiwara & Roshanravan, 2018). \nA growing number of recent works in Asian American feminism engage\nwith figures and themes in Continental feminism through the framework\nEastern philosophy and the Asian American women’s perspective\nand as such they provide new directions for a genuinely\ntransContinental feminism. For example, building on the discussions\nconcerning gender in Continental feminisms, thinkers such as Kyoo Lee\n(2014) and Robin Wang (2016) have explored different ways that the\ngendered body has been discussed. Engaging with the concept of the\n“dark female animal” (xuapin) in\nDaodejing, Kyoo Lee explores the revolutionary potential of\nxuapin, which she claims possesses a gender-bending power.\nLee argues that xuapin demonstrates \nin a sense, superiority of femaleness and femininity –as\nthe norm, albeit invisible and inaudible \nand that it is \ngender-bending: female and not female at once, heterosexualized and\nnot at once. (K. Lee 2014: 59) \nWang investigates yin-yang gender dynamics through a variety of both\nEastern and Western sources in order to answer whether yin-yang gender\nconstruction allows for gender equality. Alluding to Continental\nfeminists who wrote on gender such as Simone de Beauvoir, Judith\nButler, and Luce Irigaray, Wang discusses an exploration of gender\nthrough a Chinese framework (the yin-yang) that does not make a clear\ndistinction between sex and gender. Wang argues that yin-yang gender\nconstruction offers a dynamic and fluid description of gender\nrelationships (Wang 2016: 224). \nThis entry has listed a number of ways in which Continental approaches\nand figures are used to address feminist issues; we have attempted\nboth to describe some of the ongoing research areas in Continental\nfeminism and to point out new directions it has been taking over the\npast decades. However, this list remains incomplete as we have been\nunable to account for all of the important work underway. A more\ncomplete entry would need to include projects on the intersection\nbetween Continental feminism and critical disability studies,\nindigenous feminisms, and new materialisms and humanisms. Furthermore,\nwe do not mean to suggest that there is no overlap or intersection\nbetween the topics or figures grouped under each section heading here.\nLastly, there is certainly ongoing work of which we are not aware that\nis already making an impact on the present and future of feminist\nscholarship. We thus conclude here not with a summative statement\ndefining Continental feminism but rather by reflecting on the material\nconditions of Continental feminism. \nWhen Linda Martín Alcoff addressed the Eastern American\nPhilosophical Association in 2012, she reflected on the tension and\nissues within disciplinary philosophy and urged philosophers to\n“apply our diagnostic impulses to ourselves” (Alcoff 2013:\n43). A necessary aspect of such praxis for Continental feminists in\nlight of the genealogies considered here is exemplified by Audre Lorde\nwho, speaking on the “Personal is Political Panel” at the\nSecond Sex Conference in 1979, stated \nI urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of\nknowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any\ndifference that lives there. See whose face it wears. (Lorde 1984a:\n101) \nLorde calls feminists to enact a humble and frank confrontation with\ntheir own embodied lives and senses of self in the context of each\nperson’s differential implication in racist, sexist,\nheterosexist, classist and ableist power. Rather than imagining that\none puts on one’s thinking hat and reflects “as a\ntheorist” and then take it off and acts “as a regular\nperson”, Continental feminisms suggest that the subject who\ntheorizes is themself always an embodied subject: Kris Sealey reminds\nus that “Continental methods oftentimes refract differently\nacross race and gender axes” and that for this reason,\nContinental feminists ought “to be intentional about the\nrelationship they occupy, quite simultaneously, to racial and gender\nliberation” (Sealey 2017: 166). As this entry has shown, the\ndiversity of Continental feminist thought has been developed through\nthe thoughtful negotiation of many different struggles. For the\nimagined community of Continental feminism to continue to grow and\nsupport these projects, space must continually be made for new\npractitioners. Since, as we put above, Continental feminism is less\nconcerned with changing a woman’s place in a symbolic or social\nsystem, and more on upending that system itself, members of this\nacademic community must continue to do the work that will make it\npossible to learn from each other. Only in this way Continental\nfeminism can be opened up fully to its interdisciplinary\npotential.","contact.mail":"dhuseyin1@emory.edu","contact.domain":"emory.edu"},{"date.published":"2020-11-10","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/femapproach-continental/","author1":"Dilek Huseyinzadegan","author2":"Jana McAuliffe","entry":"femapproach-continental","body.text":"\n\n\n\n\n[Editor’s Note: The following new entry replaces the\n former entry\n on this topic by the previous author.]\n\n\n\n\nContinental feminism denotes an approach to feminist issues in\nphilosophy and the world both via figures and methods of what\nis called the “Continental” tradition in philosophy\nand via critical interventions into this tradition.\nContinental tradition in philosophy today refers to a set of\nnineteenth and twentieth century figures and theoretical traditions\nfrom mainland Europe, arising as a way for English-speaking\nphilosophers in the United States to distinguish their approach to\nphilosophical questions from that of the analytic tradition. By\nutilizing one or more of the signature schemas of the Continental\ntradition, Continental feminists contribute to problem areas ranging\nfrom metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, and social and\npolitical philosophy. Continental feminism thus refers to a body and\nstyle of work consisting of feminist interpretations of mainstream\nContinental figures (largely from what is called “Continental\nEurope”, such as Hegel, Levinas, Derrida, Foucault); feminist\nuses of psychoanalysis, phenomenology, deconstruction, genealogy, and\ncritical theory; and of interpretations of European feminists and\nfigures such as de Beauvoir, Irigaray, Arendt, and Kristeva. Note,\nhowever, that Europe is not and has never been a continent, and in\nthis sense, Continental feminism, like Continental philosophy, is more\nof an imagined community of approaches, figures, and traditions, or an\numbrella concept, rather than a precise term.\n\n\nElaine Miller points out that the term “Continental\nfeminism” came into circulation in the United States in 2007\n(Miller 2017); as she defines it, Continental feminism\n\n\n\n\ninvolves a commitment to the historicity of philosophical concepts,\nincluding the sometimes-uncomfortable contexts of their production, a\nbelief that it is through the examination of texts that the genealogy\nof ideas can be traced and resources for critically responding to them\ncan be formulated, and that the “canon” is subject to\nconstant re-interrogation and reconfiguration. (Miller 2017: 154)\n\n\n\nIn Allison Stone’s terms,\n\n\n\n\ndescribing the world as it really is—not as an aggregate of\nstatic items but as an ever-shifting web of relations—calls for\nunfamiliar, difficult language. (Stone 2015: 4)\n\n\n\nA distinguishing feature of Continental feminism, Miller and Stone\nagree, is that it\n\n\n\n\nembodies a refusal to prima facie privilege clarity and\nsuccinctness of argument over acknowledging through language the\ncomplexity, difficulty, and problematic nature of the issues being\naddressed. (Miller 2017: 154; Stone 2015: 2)\n\n\n\nAs a way of beginning to address the Euro- and U.S.-centric biases of\ncontinental philosophy, a transContinental turn in Continental\nfeminism proposed by Kyoo Lee and Alyson Cole aims to incorporate a\nglobal view of feminist issues and theories, where\n\n\n\n\n“trans” serves as a marker for the constant geo-cultural\nflows of ideas in transit, as in “transatlantic”,\n“transpacific”, “transoceanic”, etc., as well\nas for cutting-edge works, conversations, and debates in\ntrans-critical, cultural, disciplinary, human, gender, genic, lingual,\nmedial, national fields, etc., and as trans*feminist discourses. (Cole\nand Lee 2019: iv)\n\n\n\nAccordingly, this entry will take Continental feminism to include the\nfollowing distinct yet related set of issues and areas: (1) the\nfeminist use of figures, traditions, and approaches of\nphenomenology/existentialism, psychoanalysis, post-structuralism\n(deconstruction and genealogy), and critical theory; (2) critical\ninterventions into the assumptions about sex, gender, class, race,\nability, religion, and age endemic to European philosophy; and (3)\ninterpretations of hitherto underrepresented figures and methods of\nfeminism from a transContinental and transAtlantic perspective that\nestablish new, abandoned, or previously delegitimated genealogies for\nfeminist thought.\n\n\nIt is important to note that not all Continental feminists are\nphilosophers or work in Philosophy departments; thus, Continental\nfeminism is interdisciplinary and its practitioners come from various\nfields. As this subfield developed in the early 2000s, there were\nalready disciplinary, intra-disciplinary and extra-disciplinary\nprojects that explored feminist issues by utilizing phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, deconstructive, and critical theoretical approaches.\nRather than organizing this entry around the signature schemas of the\nContinental tradition and subsuming ongoing work that uses these\napproaches under them, this entry will locate crucial genealogies for\nContinental feminism in the work of Black feminists, post- and\ndecolonial feminists, women of color feminists, Asian American\nfeminists, trans feminists, and queer feminists. We take these\ngenealogies as central to the past, present, and future of Continental\nfeminism, and accordingly this entry is organized topically, in order\nto outline the ways that Continental feminisms have developed in\nconversation and in tension with these interdisciplinary projects.\nThese projects have been unearthing the cissexist,\nsexist/misogynistic, racist, heterosexist, classist, ageist, ableist,\ncolonial commitments of philosophy as a discipline and a professional\nfield as they are simultaneously expanding, transforming, and pushing\nthe concerns and methods of Continental thought in interdisciplinary\niterations. Indeed, what distinguishes Continental feminism clearly\nfrom Analytic feminism are its call for interdisciplinarity and its\nbelief that feminist omissions themselves can become sites from which\nnew projects are launched, as will be highlighted throughout this\nentry. As such, Continental feminism starts with the premise that\nEuropean or Anglo-American norms and categories of thought can be\ninterpreted, critiqued, and re-envisioned or abandoned for feminist\npurposes.\n\nContinental feminists share with other Continental thinkers an\ninterest in close reading that uses careful exegesis to unpack the\ndeep meanings of texts through attention to their linguistic and\nhistorical specificity. However, to utilize a philosophical tradition\nthat has largely presumed rather than explored the impacts of sex and\ngender on material life, continental feminists often read irreverently\nto focus on concerns that traditional philosophy might push to the\nside. While all feminist theorizing deals with questions of power,\nsubjectivity, and culture, Continental feminist approaches to these\nissues are often critical in the sense that they explore how\nexternal power dynamics affect the constitution of inner experiences,\nand in turn how embodied and subjective re-articulations of power can\nand should transform the world in the pursuit of justice. This\nfrequently involves taking lived experience as a crucial component of\ncritical philosophy; as Gail Weiss puts it, \nonly by interrogating the “ordinary” dimensions of\nexperience is it possible to arrive at an understanding of the dynamic\nforces that give meaning to individual lives and that are both the\nobstacle and the vehicle to achieving lasting social change. (Weiss\n2008: 5) \nTo present a broad sketch of characteristics of continental feminism\nthroughout its history, this section focuses on methods that\nContinental feminists use to engage embodied experience in their\nprojects. The gendered critique of the traditional Western\nphilosophical tendency to dichotomize the body that feels and the mind\nthat thinks is an ongoing theme in continental feminism (see entry on\n feminist perspectives on the body).\n The account presented here is not at all complete, as the specific\naims and methods of such feminist projects differ widely, most\nimportantly in terms of how an analysis of sex and gender is impacted\nby other aspects of embodied experience such as race, sexuality, and\nability. This section first addresses some ways that continental\nfeminists trouble a mind-body distinction by engaging affect and\nemotion in their work. Next, it explores two examples of how\ncontinental traditions, psychoanalysis and phenomenology, are made\ninto critical resources in Continental feminist projects. Finally, it\npresents work that engages an ongoing critique of culture and everyday\nexperience as an important aspect of feminist theorizing. \nMany Continental feminists focus on the overlaying of mental and\nphysical experience via the concepts of affect, emotion, and feeling.\nAffect is described by Teresa Brennan as “the physiological\nshift accompanying a judgment” (Brennan 2004: 5). The\n“transmission of affect” describes the way that one can\ncatch the mood of another; this experience is “social in origin\nbut biological and physical in effect” (Brennan 2004: 3).\nBrennan describes transmission as when the “emotions or\naffects of one person, and the enhancing or depressing energies these\naffects entail” pass from one person to another (Brennan 2004:\n3). Affect is thus one way to describe how social experience impacts\nthe corporeal life of subjects through the transference of energy. In\nBrennan’s case, affective states are directional; they\nare not neutral but push or press on subjects. At the same time, terms\nlike affect and feeling might be distinguished based on the extent to\nwhich one considers affect to be already coded with or influenced by\nsocial significance for a subject (see Ahmed 2010: 230–231,\nSeigworth & Gregg 2010, esp. 5–8). \nContinental feminist projects on emotion often analyze historically\ncontextualized experiences. Ann Cvetkovich engages with trauma in a\nway that \nfocuses on the everyday and the insidious…and situates it in a\nsocial and cultural frame rather than a medical one. (Cvetkovich 2007:\n464) \nShe then presents a political account of depression that\ndepathologizes such negatively-connotated emotional experiences so\nthat they can become more visible in public and thus create a\npotential foundation for community (Cvetkovich 2007: 460). In The\nCultural Politics of Emotion, Sara Ahmed argues that emotion is\ngenerated when meaning is produced across social-political\ninteraction; these feelings create the boundaries of affinity groups\nand impact self-understanding. In this analysis, emotions help\nconstitute what a person understands as their objective condition, and\nthus \nemotions are not “in” either the individual or the social,\nbut produce the very surfaces and boundaries that allow all kinds of\nobjects to be delineated. (Ahmed 2004 [2014: 10]) \nBecause feeling is often ambivalent and multi-faceted, rather than in\nspite of this complexity, social critics who attend to how affects are\nemployed and manipulated in both textual and social-political\nargumentation can produce readings that trouble an easy dichotomy\nbetween what is a “good” and what a “bad”\nexperience. \nPsychoanalytically-informed projects use concepts such as trauma,\nmourning, melancholia, and abjection to analyze embodied experience\n(Irigaray 1974 [1985]; Spillers 1996; Butler 1997; Felman 2002; Oliver\n2004; entry on\n psychoanalytic feminism).\n They frequently engage aesthetics as an aspect of social critique\n(Chanter 2008; Kristeva 1980 [1982]; Miller 2014). This allows a\nsymptomatic reading of feeling to be interpreted back against the\nsocial order, as is seen in Judith Butler’s Frames of\nWar. In this text, Butler analyzes what makes a life grievable\nand argues that the questions of who appears as a human, whose life\nshould be protected, and who does not are all figured in advance of\nany particular political decision through a pre-reflexive manipulation\nof affect (Butler 2009 [2016: 64]). Supplementing democratic theory\nwith Continental feminist interpretations, Noëlle McAfee deploys\nKristeva and the resources in her thought, as well as psychoanalysis,\nspecifically on the issues of affect and the notion of the\n“political unconscious” (McAfee 2000 and 2008). \nCritical phenomenologists draw on the methods of phenomenology to\ndemonstrate “the multiple ways in which power moves through our\nbodies and our lives” (Introduction, Weiss, Murphy, &\nSalamon 2020: xiv). Lisa Guenther understands critical phenomenology\nas both a way of doing philosophy and a way of approaching political\nactivism (Guenther 2020: 15). Most characteristically, Guenther argues\nthat critical phenomenology employs reworked versions of \nMerleau-Ponty’s concept of the body schema to account for\ngendered and sexual schemas (Simone de Beauvoir, Iris Marion Young,\nTalia Mae Bettcher, Gayle Salamon), racialized schemas (Frantz Fanon,\nLewis Gordon, Sara Ahmed, George Yancy, Alia Al-Saji), disability\nschemas (Kay Toombs, Lisa Diedrich, Havi Carel), and other aspects of\nlived experience. (Guenther 2020: 13–14) \nA recent volume edited by Gail Weiss, Ann V, Murphy, and Gayle\nSalamon, entitled 50 Concepts for a Critical* Phenomenology\n(2020), shows that many of the central concepts of critical\nphenomenology intersect with Continental feminism. \nFinally, considering the social and political import of inner states\nand the centering of quotidian experiences of power enable Continental\nfeminists to explore culture as it develops. For instance, Shannon\nSullivan’s Good White People: The Problem with Middle-Class\nAnti-Racism focuses on “the personal side of whiteness and\nwhite privilege” with attention to the embodied experience of\nrace (S. Sullivan 2014: 19) to critique the ways through which white\nliberals set themselves up as altruistic, “good” white\npeople through, e.g., hypocritical modes of tolerance that maintain\nwhite domination (S. Sullivan 2014: 4). Robin James’\nResilience & Melancholy explores pop music as a way to\nanalyze the impact of neoliberal biopolitics; she combines music\ntheory with psychoanalytic and Foucauldian philosophies to critique\ncomplicity with multi-racial white supremacist patriarchy and argues\nthat music, e.g., Rihanna’s, offer strategies for countering\nthis oppressive power (R. James 2015). In Irony in the Age of\nEmpire: Comic Perspectives on Philosophy and Freedom, Cynthia\nWillett engages film and stand-up comedy to articulate a libidinal\nunderstanding of freedom that can counter the liberal paradigms of\nindividuality with a sense of freedom defined “in terms of\nequality and solidarity” (Willett 2008: 14). Erin Tarver\nanalyzes practices of sports fans, with particular attention to\nfootball, baseball, and basketball fans in the American South, to\nbetter understand how individual and group identities are maintained\nto “…shore up, reproduce, and very occasionally, subvert\nracial, sexual and gender hierarchies” (Tarver 2017: 3). This\nwork is often interdisciplinary, and some of these projects work at\nthe intersection between continental and pragmatist feminisms (see\nentry on\n intersections between pragmatist and continental feminism). \nSimultaneously reading carefully and irreverently, continental\nfeminists deepen the philosophical account of experience by\nintegrating historically contextualized feeling into their projects,\nusing and transmuting philosophical traditions and traditional\nfigures, and interrogating everyday experiences in their embodied and\ncultural specificity. This work insists that meaning and social order\nfunction through unrecognized cooptation, subordination or exclusion\nin various intersectional constellations. In general, continental\nfeminisms are less concerned with changing a woman’s place in a\nsymbolic or social system, and more focused on upending such systems,\nas will be explored in more detail in the following sections. \nThis section on the convergences between Black and Continental\nfeminist thought begins with a discussion about the history of Black\nfeminist scholarship utilizing existential/phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, critical, and hermeneutic approaches. It then\nintroduces intersectionality as the major heuristic for Black feminist\ntheorizing, and concludes by highlighting emerging areas and\nintersections between Black studies and Black feminist Continental\nthought. \nBlack women have long been contributors to the Continental\nphilosophical tradition. One may argue that their contributions to\nprofessional philosophy started after the graduation of the first\nBlack woman to earn the PhD in philosophy, Joyce Mitchell Cook, who\ncompleted the degree in 1965 from Princeton University. Even prior to\nthis date, however, Black women engaged in projects that we can\nrecognize as Continental feminist projects. Importantly, \nmany Black intellectuals in the United States going back (at least) to\nthe nineteenth century offered what are now described as existential,\nphenomenological, and/or genealogical analyses of race and racism.\n(Belle 2012, 329 fn. 1) \nThese contributions did not always occur in the form of traditional\nphilosophical discussions, nor are they always created by those who\nhave professional degrees in philosophy, which is certainly true of\nthe nineteenth and early twentieth century thinkers, Sojourner Truth,\nMaria W. Stewart, and\n Anna Julia Cooper. \nBlack feminists’ contributions to Continental philosophy\ndemonstrate the ways in which their voices are crucial to both shaping\nand expanding the discipline. Kathryn Sophia Belle, Donna-Dale\nMarcano, and Maria del Guadalupe Davidson edited Convergences:\nBlack Feminism and Continental Philosophy (del Guadalupe et al.\n2010), the only text at the publication of this entry that addresses\nboth these topics simultaneously. For the editors, the concept of\nconvergence is demonstrated by the natural, historical, and necessary\nengagement of Black women with Continental philosophy. Belle\nwrites, \nBlack feminist and womanist thinkers inevitably address the very same\nissues of agency, identity, alienation, power, and so on that are\nraised in much recent Continental philosophy. Likewise, from Immanuel\nKant to the feminist thinkers of the present, Continental philosophy\nhas engaged, to some extent, with issues of race and gender. (2010:\n5) \nThe Black feminist tradition in Continental philosophy demonstrates\nthat Black women are not strangers nor enemies of Continental\nphilosophy; rather, their unique theoretical positioning affords them\nthe opportunity to utilize, challenge, and expand the tradition. \nBlack feminist thinkers contribute to Continental feminist thought in\nat least two ways. First, they engage directly with Continental\nfigures and theories. For example, Lorraine Hansberry comments that\nSimone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex (1949, translated\nin 1953) was arguably the “most important work of this\ncentury” (1957 [1995: 129 and 133]), and Antillean thinker\nPaulette Nardal draws on both features of the Harlem Renaissance and\nexistentialist thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre to provide a\nphenomenological and genealogical account of how the Black race, and\nAntilleans in particular, have come to understand their own notion of\nrace consciousness in “The Awakening of Race\nConsciousness” (1932). More recently, they engage with canonical\nfigures and ideologies of Continental philosophy, as in the work of\nKathryn Sophia Belle on Hannah Arendt (2014) or Kris Sealey on\nEmmanuel Levinas (2014). Second, regardless of their professional\nPhilosophy degrees or lack thereof, Black feminist thinkers utilize\nthe tools of the Continental tradition as part of their\ninterdisciplinary approaches, as in the use of Foucault in the work of\nSylvia Wynter (2003) and the use of Freud, Lacan, and psychoanalysis\nin the work of Hortense Spillers (1996). \nBlack feminist thinkers have frequently used intersectionality as an\neffective entry-point into conversations with the Continental\ntradition. Intersectionality is a Black feminist theory that describes\nthe oppression that Black women experience as a result of lying at the\nnexus of simultaneously impactful identities, such as that of race,\ngender, class, and sexuality. As such, intersectionality can be used\nas a phenomenological tool to describe Black women’s lived\nexperience of oppression. While legal theorist Kimberlé\nCrenshaw coined the term in 1989, the theory has been articulated at\nleast since the mid-nineteenth century in Sojourner Truth’s\nproclamation, “Ain’t I a Woman?” (1851). In the\nspeech, Truth highlights that Black women are treated with less\nrespect than white women while bearing the same burdens of racism as\nBlack men. Anna Julia Cooper wrote that Black women are \nconfronted by a both a woman question and a race problem and is as yet\nan unknown or an unacknowledged factor in both. (1892 [1988: 134]) \nIn their collective statement from April 1977, The Combahee River\nCollective argues that \nBlack feminism [is] the logical political movement to combat the\nmanifold and simultaneous oppressions that all women of color face \nand that \n[t]here is also undeniably a personal genesis for Black feminism, that\nis, the political realization that comes from the seemingly personal\nexperiences of individual Black women’s lives. (Taylor 2017: 15\nand 17) \nIntersectionality is thus a hallmark of Black feminist thought because\nit prioritizes the lived experiences of Black women. In doing so, it\nsupplies the tools to think about the extent to which one’s\nconsciousness the world is informed by experiences of racism, sexism,\nclassism, and homophobia. \nIn addition to its utility in explaining Black women’s lived\nexperience, intersectionality also provides tools for Black feminists\nto critique the presumed whiteness and bourgeois-class status of\nfeminism and to combat various forms of oppression and violence. Thus,\nintersectionality is also key to critiquing phenomenological analysis,\nthat is, analysis of lived experiences and feminist movements through\nthe lens of sociopolitical identities such as race, sex, and class.\nAngela Davis’s text Women, Race, & Class (1981) is\nan early model of this approach; it details the history of U.S.\nwomen’s movements and their consideration, or lack thereof, of\nthe class-based and racial dimensions of womanhood. Texts such as\nPatricia Hill-Collins’s Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge,\nConsciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment (1990 [2015]) underscore\nthe ways in which Black women create their own epistemological\nstandpoint as a result of their lived experiences. In the 1970s to\n90s, when Black women’s contributions to academia reached its\nzenith, Black feminist scholars such as Barbara Christian in\n“The Race for Theory” (1988), Toni Morrison in Playing\nin the Dark (1992), and Audre Lorde in “The Master’s\nTools will Never Dismantle the Master’s House” (1984a) and\n“Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference”\n(1984b) exemplified Black women’s critiques of theoretical\napproaches that adopt a “neutral” stance toward feminist\nmovements where neutral meant presuming all women to be white,\nmiddle-class, young or middle-aged, and heterosexual (see also Hull,\nBell-Scott, & Smith 1982). \nCurrent Black feminist work centers Black epistemologies,\npractices, and concepts. The burgeoning scholarship of Black women\nphilosophers continue to push the boundaries of Continental feminism,\nas in the work of Lindsey Stewart’s work on Black feminist\npractices of freedom (2017), Camisha Russell’s work on the\nissues of race and gender in assisted reproduction (2018), and Axelle\nKarera’s work, which focuses on the Anthropocene and\nantiBlackness (2019). In addition to engaging with the canonical\nfigures of the Continental tradition, Black thinkers harvest\nphilosophy from their own perspective and experience of the world as\nwell as their theoretical archives. Much of this more recent work\nintersects with Black Studies. The work of Black thinkers from\ndisciplines other than philosophy are intersecting with Continental\nphilosophical and feminist approaches, as seen in the works of such as\nSaidiya Hartman (1997, 2007, and 2019), Christina Sharpe (2016),\nRizvana Bradley (2014 and 2018), Jennifer Nash (2019), Denise Ferreira\nda Silva (2007, 2014, and 2018), Riley Snorton (2017), Selamawit\nTerrefe (2020), and Zakiyyah Iman Jackson (2020). \nContinental feminist approaches to questions on colonialism revolve\naround two main sets of investigations: on the one hand, the\ninterrogation of the hegemony of the West as an abstract category that\nis deployed strategically to exclude and inferiorize communities\ndeemed Non-Western (Spivak 1999; Narayan 1997; Mohanty 1984), and on\nthe other hand, the question of coloniality, which focuses on the\npolitical and epistemic ordering of the globe starting with the\ncolonization of the Americas (Lugones 2003; Wynter 1995; Ortega 2016).\nTo this end, these approaches both use schemas of the Continental\ntradition (such as phenomenology, psychoanalysis, genealogy,\ndeconstruction, and poststructuralism) and call into question the\ngeographic and racial assumptions that underlie Continental\nphilosophy. For both of these approaches, an analysis of colonialism\nis inseparable from the political aim of challenging and undoing the\ncolonial world. This challenge entails deconstructing the categories\nof the colonially determined globe (such as East-West,\nWestern-Non-Western, Developed-Underdeveloped, First World-Third\nWorld, North-South) through focusing on the concrete lived experiences\nof individuals and communities. This section focuses on the general\ncharacteristics of these two Continental feminist approaches taken up\nunder the rough categories of postcolonial and decolonial feminisms,\nwith the former focusing on the Western-Non-western divide that marks\ncolonial relations, and the latter on the North-South dialogues that\nemerge within the relations of coloniality. It concludes by\nhighlighting coalitional thinking, a fundamental aspect of both post-\nand decolonial feminist approaches. \nPostcolonial feminist approaches maintain that in order to interrogate\nthe hegemony of the West, it is necessary to deconstruct the ways in\nwhich it is deployed to exclude the non-Western subject. Furthermore,\nsuch deployment is always a strategic one, insofar as the\n“West” is not a concrete geographical category, and the\nparadigm of Western subjectivity is continuously built by demarcating\nthose who do not fit in it. Postcolonial feminisms are\ninterdisciplinary and not limited to the field of philosophy, and they\nchallenge the inscription of the gender, racial, and geographic\ncategories that underlie the hegemony of the Western subject. In doing\nso, Continental feminist approaches engage with figures from\npoststructuralism and critical theory (such as Foucault, Derrida,\nDeleuze and Adorno), and they deploy methods such as genealogy and\ndeconstruction (Spivak 1988; Mohanty 1984), in order to question the\nunderlying geographic and gendered assumptions of these methods. In\n“Can the Subaltern Speak?” for example, Gayatri\nChakravorty Spivak engages with French poststructuralism and questions\nthe paradigms of speech/reason that deny the very possibility of\ncapacities such as resistance for those that do not fit within the\ngeographic, racialized, and gendered boundaries of Western\nSubjectivity (Spivak 1988). In doing so, she highlights the ways in\nwhich poststructuralism relies upon the very categories (of speech,\nreason, or universal subjectivity) that it ostensibly critiques. \nThe tension highlighted by Spivak, in which the Western Subject\nconstitutes both the dominant subject and the only subject capable of\nresistance, underlies postcolonial feminisms’ critique of the\nalignment of the West with modernity and progress (McClintock 1995;\nStoler 1995). Chandra Talpade Mohanty, in “Under Western\nEyes”, criticizes the hegemony of Western approaches in defining\nthe scope and goals of feminist struggles. Issues such as the veil\ndebate, in this sense, point to the political and phenomenological\nracialization of the Non-Western woman (Al-Saji 2010; Sheth 2006). At\nthe same time, Uma Narayan draws attention to the risks of fetishizing\nthe category of the Non-Western and highlights how such a\nfetishization remains within colonially determined divisions (Narayan\n1997; Narayan & Harding 2000). Namita Goswami, in Subjects\nThat Matter, develops heterogeneity as a kind of conceptual\ncontinuity between feminism, philosophy, and postcolonial studies,\nwhich allows for an understanding of difference beyond oppositional\nand antagonistic terms (Goswami 2019). \nDecolonial feminisms emerge primarily from the U.S. Latina and Latinx\ncontexts and have a different genealogy, insofar as they are in\ndialogue with Latin American Philosophy, Continental Philosophy,\nAnglo-American Thought, and especially U.S. Women of Color feminisms.\nFocusing on North-South dialogues, Latin American and Latina Feminist\nphilosophers such as Ofelia Schutte engage with the work of figures\nsuch as Nietzsche, Kristeva, and Irigaray while developing Latin\nAmerican philosophy as a field in U.S. academic philosophy (Schutte\n1984; 1993; for more, see the entry on\n Latin American feminism).\n Linda Martín Alcoff, for example, brings Latin American\nPhilosophy (particularly the work of Enrique Dussel) in dialogue with\nexistentialism and poststructuralism in order to develop the framework\nfor Latinx feminisms (Alcoff 2006, 2015). \nOne of the major frameworks of decolonial feminisms is “the\ncoloniality of power”, a term first introduced by Aníbal\nQuijano, and defined as “the social classification of the\nworld’s population around the idea of race” (Quijano 2000:\n1). In this sense, the colonization of the Americas is not only a\nhistorical moment, but also the emergence of race and the subsequent\nreorganization of the globe in accordance with what Walter Mignolo\ncalls “the colonial difference”, denoting the abstract\npositioning of Europe as the global hegemonic power (Mignolo 2002).\nDecolonial feminisms take an intersectional approach to the\ncoloniality of power and investigate, as María Lugones says,\n“the emergence of hegemonic gender arrangements along\n‘racial’ lines” starting with the colonization of\nthe Americas (Lugones 2007: 190). Decolonial feminists such as Lugones\nand Wynter bring poststructuralist critique in dialogue with Latin\nAmerican philosophy and argue that dominant gender arrangements\nthemselves are colonial; these arrangements, such as patriarchy,\nheterosexualism, or gender dimorphism mark concrete historical\nprocesses of the racial inscription of gender norms, starting from and\nwith the coloniality of power (Lugones 2008; Oyěwùmí\n2007; Wynter 2006). \nDecolonial feminisms’ emphasis on historical critique is\ninseparable from a concern with the concrete lived experiences of\nwomen of color (Moraga and Anzaldúa 1981 [2015]; Pérez\n1999; Lugones 2007, Sandoval 2000). Gloria Anzaldúa, in\nBorderlands/La Frontera, emphasizes bordered thinking as the\nunderlying logic of contemporary systems of oppression, and she\nformulates the resistances of hybrid identities that emerge both out\nof and in response to such bordered thinking (Anzaldúa 1987).\nMariana Ortega develops Latina feminist phenomenology in emphasizing\nboth the lived experience of borderlands and exile, and the\npossibilities of resistance by developing “home-tactics”\nin and through these experiences (Ortega 2016). \nCoalitional thinking is a fundamental aspect of both post- and\ndecolonial feminist approaches. Mohanty calls for coalitions across\nborders in thinking through the concrete lived experiences and\nemphasizes the importance of situated and local struggles in\nunderstanding hegemonic power relations.  Moraga and Anzaldúa,\nin their coedited collection This Bridge Called My Back, call\nfor concrete and sustained coalitions that are based on an\nintersectional understanding of women’s lives, rather than\nabstract calls for sisterhood. Decolonial feminists such as Lugones,\nChela Sandoval, Ortega, and Emma Pérez, maintain that\ncoalitional thinking cannot be an afterthought for any anti- or\ndecolonial struggles (Pérez 1999; Sandoval 2000). \nAs Continental feminism expands, it involves further conversations\nwith and in-between these approaches. The questions around the\n“continent” of Continental feminism, as well as how such a\ncontinent is situated within the colonial geographic boundaries of the\nWest and the Global North, continue to be challenged. As spaces for\nsuch a flow of ideas open up, further conversations on the possibility\nof coalition, as well as on challenging the limits of colonial thought\ncontinue to reshape the face of Continental feminism. \nThe relationship between Continental feminism and queer theory is\nsimultaneously productive and fraught. While far from exhaustive, this\nentry will first highlight some of the overlapping figures and\napproaches between the two fields, including examples of scholarship\nat their intersections. It will then briefly introduce one account of\nthe tension between them. Finally, it will close with some reflections\non the shared problems across these fields, including their\nhistorically white and Anglo-Eurocentric approaches, as well as how\nrecent work in queer of color critique aligns with and points to new\ndirections in Continental feminism. \nIn the late 1980s and the early 1990s, “queer” emerged as\na reclamation of a homophobic slur and a rallying cry for a coalition\nof the marginalized against the tyranny of the normal (Barker &\nScheele 2016; D. Hall & Jagose 2012; Warner 1993; Sedgwick 1993;\nAnzaldúa 1991 [2009]). Formed in the crucible of the AIDS\ncrisis, which sharpened the need to understand the violence\nexperienced by people excluded by norms related to gender and\nsexuality, “queer” was meant to bring attention to the\nrange of sexual/gender practices deemed outside the purview of the\nnormal. In one genealogy of queer theory, the field develops this\nearly activist reclamation of the term queer into a wide-reaching\ncritique of how norms operate in and through dominant\nconceptualizations of identity. Given this motivating impulse of\ndeconstruction, or of denaturalizing categories such as sexuality, it\nis perhaps of no surprise that queer theory has historically been a\nfield well-populated with figures (e.g., Lacan, Foucault, Derrida) and\nmethodological approaches (poststructuralism, psychoanalysis,\nphenomenology) that have been associated with Continental philosophy,\nespecially twentieth century European philosophy. \nQueer theory frequently draws on, critiques, and expands the ideas of\nmany figures and approaches that are seen as early progenitors of\nContinental feminism (e.g., Beauvoir, Irigaray, Kristeva, feminist\nphenomenology, feminist poststructuralism, critical theory,\npsychoanalytic theory). As Jagose (2009) points out, however, the\ncritique of normative identity categories was not invented by queer\ntheory, given that feminist scholarship has a rich history of\nradically disrupting the category of women along lines of race and\nsexuality. Moreover, the lines between feminism and queer theory are\nhistorically blurred. For example, Judith Butler—who is often\ncited as an originator of queer theory—explicitly marks her\nearly work as occurring in the intersection of these fields (as well\nas a number of other critical discourses) (1997). In Gender\nTrouble (1990) and Bodies that Matter (1993), Butler\ndraws on Continental feminist figures such as Irigaray, Beauvoir, and\nKristeva, and methods ranging from psychoanalysis to poststructuralism\nand phenomenology to develop a simultaneously queer and feminist\ntheoretical lens focused on understanding the relationship between\ngender and sexuality, as well as the operation of norms and identity\ncategories more broadly (Salih 2002). \nA second major figure in the relationship between Continental feminism\nand queer theory is Michel Foucault, who has been extensively used in\nboth queer and Continental (and specifically poststructuralist)\nfeminist theory, but who (as opposed to Butler) did not explicitly use\nthe terms queer and feminist. While a larger account of the connection\nbetween Foucault and queer theory is beyond the scope of this entry,\nthe relationship is a rich one. In the late 1980s, Foucault’s\nThe History of Sexuality, Volume One was read\nheavily by activists and scholars questioning dominant narratives\naround sexuality and identity (Halperin 1995); Foucault’s work\nwas also influential not only for Judith Butler’s Gender\nTrouble (1990) but also for another text often cited as\nfoundational for queer theory, Eve Sedgwick’s Epistemology\nof the Closet (1990 [2008]). \nFoucault’s genealogical approach to identity, including his\nexploration of the histories and models of power at work in modern\nconceptions of sexuality, has been important for a number of\ncontemporary scholars working at the intersections of feminism and\nqueer theory (Huffer 2010 and 2020; Russell 2010; Sawicki 2005;\nSchotten 2018; Winnubst 2006). For example, Ladelle McWhorter (1999)\ntakes up Foucault’s account of ethics as a practice of the self,\nor how we work on ourselves to become particular kinds of people,\nthrough a queer framework that resists expected developmental\ntrajectories and normative timelines of a life (e.g., heterosexual\ncoupling resulting in marriage and children). And in a different vein,\nJasbir Puar (2007) has drawn on Foucault’s theories of power (as\nwell as a wide range of interdisciplinary theory including\npostcolonial feminist theory) to analyze the relationship between\ncontemporary biopower and homonationalism, or how certain\n“good” gay and lesbian subjects, by aligning themselves\nwith U.S. imperialism, are welcomed into the nation-state. \nFigures associated with Continental feminism who do not necessarily\nmark themselves or their work as queer have also been used in queer\ntheoretical projects, just as feminists have historically done with\nany number of non-feminist philosophers. For example, queer studies\nscholars have explored the relative absence of Irigaray in queer\ntheory, argued for the queer resources of her thinking (Huffer 2013;\nWinnubst 2006), called attention to the potential use of\nIrigaray’s disruption of binaries for queer analyses of identity\n(Butler 1993: 36–39; Grosz 1989), and used Irigarayan concepts\nto develop queer analyses of longstanding feminist issues, such as the\nexperience of breast feeding (R. Lee 2018). \nPhenomenological methods can also track this traffic between\nContinental feminism and queer theory. For example, Sara Ahmed’s\nQueer Phenomenology (2006) explores the use of phenomenology\nin queer studies by asking, among other questions, how to understand\nthe “orientation” of sexual orientation as the way bodies\nare directed towards particular objects and away from others. In\ndeveloping this queer use of phenomenology, Ahmed acknowledges her\ndebt to feminist philosophers of the body such as Sandra Bartky, Iris\nMarion Young, Rosalyn Diprose, and Gail Weiss, as well as early\nphenomenologists such as de Beauvoir and phenomenologists of race\nincluding Linda Alcoff, Frantz Fanon, and Lewis Gordon. \nGiven these examples of the overlap of figures and approaches in\nContinental feminism and queer theory, it is worth asking what\ndistinguishes the approaches. One may be tempted to say that feminism\nfocuses more on gender (historically, within continental feminism,\nthis may be more commonly discussed as sexual difference) and queer\ntheory focuses more on sexuality (including questions of pleasure,\ndesire, and eroticism). Yet many working within Continental feminism,\nespecially as inflected with French theory, also focus on questions\nrelated to sexuality such as pleasure, desire, and eroticism. And\nthere are also reasons to be suspicious of how the gender-sexuality\nsplit is narrated as a feminist-queer split. While some have argued\nthat there are good reasons to draw distinctions between these fields\nin order to do justice to their distinct concerns (G. Rubin 2011;\nHalley 2006), there have also been many challenges to overly\nprogrammatic forms of this separation (Huffer 2013) and accounts of\nhow this narrative can overlook the field’s mutual interest in\nunderstanding the complex relationship between gender and sexuality,\nas well as the possibility of a queer feminism (Jagose 2009).\nNevertheless, despite the overlaps in figures and archives, as well as\nthe wealth of resources in queer theory on topics that Continental\nfeminist philosophers hold dear (temporality, embodiment, identity,\nand desire, to name only a few), the relatively slow uptake of texts\nmarked explicitly as queer theory has been noticeable (Winnubst 2010).\nThis is not to erase the important work done at the intersections of\nthese fields but to acknowledge that the relationship is not a\nseamless one. In their introductory comments to a “Roundtable on\nContinental Feminism”, Lynne Huffer and Shannon Winnubst (2017)\nnote the relative lack of engagement with queer theory among the\ncontributions, and they ask whether Continental feminism is capacious\nenough to embrace queer theory, a question that has also been posed to\nphilosophy more broadly (Ahmed 2016b; Salamon 2009; Winnubst\n2010). \nFinally, both Continental feminism and queer theory have also been\nextensively critiqued for the whiteness and Anglo-Eurocentric nature\nof their archives. In one particularly well-known rendition of this\ncritique, Cathy Cohen asks whether queer theory has lived up to its\nanti-identitarian promise of creating coalitions across difference\n(2005). As a way to intervene in the whiteness of queer theory\n(Johnson and Henderson 2005), Roderick Ferguson (2004) coined the\nterm “queer of color critique” to describe how various\nintersections of race, gender, sexuality, and class operate in\nnationalistic discourses of identity and belonging; it is, in\nFerguson’s words, \na heterogenous enterprise made up of women of color feminism,\nmaterialist analysis, poststructuralist theory, and queer critique.\n(Ferguson 2004: 149) \nOther notable and early contributors to this sub-field include\nJosé Muñoz, E. Patrick Johnson, Chandan Reddy, and\nGayatri Gopinath. Although the topics at work in queer of color\ncritique concerning identity, embodiment, temporality, and affect have\nalso been topics of central interests to Continental feminists, the\nuptake of queer of color critique, as with queer theory, has been slow\nin Continental feminism. However, as Continental feminism\nexpands—as shown through this entry— the resources of\nqueer theory and queer of color critique are waiting in the wings as\ncrucial, if at times under acknowledged, interlocutors. \nLike Continental feminism, queer theory and queer of color critique\ncontinue the longstanding feminist tradition of sending texts and\nideas in directions they were perhaps never intended to travel. Recent\ntrajectories at the crossroads of Continental feminism and queer\nstudies include attention to neoliberal capitalism (Winnubst 2015;\nMcWhorter 2012), sex and gender in ancient Greek metaphysics (Bianchi\n2014); critical disability theory (Puar 2017; K. Hall 2014; Yergeau\n2018; and Gallop 2019), Latina feminism and existential phenomenology\n(Ortega 2016), affect and temporality (Ahmed 2019; Amin 2017; Freeman\n2019), and materialism and concepts of agency (Chen 2012). As explored\nin the next section, another important interlocutor with both\nContinental feminism and queer theory is transgender studies. \nA number of scholars have noted the complex interplay of shared and\ndistinct concerns between trans, feminist, and queer frameworks\n(Namaste 1996 and 2009; Prosser 1998; Heyes 2003; Salamon 2010a;\nStryker 2004). Emerging in the 1990s as a distinct field of academic\ninquiry, trans studies shares many of the intellectual roots of queer\ntheory yet also departs from queer studies through its explicit focus\non trans experience, including both non-monolithic nature of that\nexperience and the importance of trans people speaking for themselves\nabout their own lives. Likewise, while many of the theoretical\nframeworks and figures at the heart of Continental feminism are\npresent in trans studies (e.g., post-structuralism, phenomenology,\nFoucauldian genealogy, materialism), there have also been important\ncritiques of how Continental feminist approaches can ignore or\nsideline trans experience. Significantly, many of the philosophers\nworking in Continental feminism and trans studies cited in this entry\ncross inter- and intra-disciplinary boundaries. \nIn exploring the relationship between Continental feminist and trans\nstudies, it is crucial to acknowledge the forms that transphobia and\ntrans-exclusionary gestures can assume in feminist discourse more\ngenerally. For an extended overview of this history, see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on trans issues.\n The entry explains points of terminology (trans, transgender, trans*,\ntranssexual), as well as the historical emergence of transgender\nstudies and the broader (i.e., non-Continental specific) relationship\nbetween feminist and trans issues. \nIn one widely recognized form of feminist transphobia (found in the\nwork of trans-exclusionary radical feminists such as Janice Raymond),\ntrans women are portrayed as not “real” women and as\nthreats to feminist movements (Bettcher 2006, 2007; McKinnon 2018).\nHowever, there is another strand of feminist theory that has a\ndistinct relationship to trans issues, and (importantly for present\npurposes) it is a lineage of feminism that draws heavily on\nContinental figures such as Butler. While there is no doubt that\nButler’s work has been foundational in trans studies as well as\nin queer theory (Gerdes 2014; Salah 2007), it is also the case that\nher work has been critiqued for its selective use of trans experience\n(Prosser 1998; Namaste 1996; H. Rubin 1998). Critics point out that\ntrans identity tends be affirmed in Butlerian queer feminist discourse\nwhen it can be used to demonstrate the actual constructedness of\ngender, or its lack of ontological necessity, but also that some trans\nidentity is portrayed as problematically essentialist when accompanied\nby claims to “really be” a man or a woman and/or demands\nfor medical transition (Valentine 2012). While Prosser and Rubin both\ncritique this rejection of claims to gender realness from a\nphenomenological perspective (and Prosser (1998) from a psychoanalytic\nframework as well), Namaste (1996) focuses on the institutional\nreality of gender that is often sidelined in these debates. In\nresponse, Jack Halberstam has argued that, while Prosser’s\nfrustration with a selective use of trans identity in queer and\nfeminist theory is understandable, there are still significant\nproblems with the normativity inherent in the idea of gendered\nrealness (2005). \nNotably, the proliferation of non-trans feminist writers working on\ntrans issues in the 1990s led to Jacob Hale’s “Suggested\nRules for Non-Transsexuals Writing about Transsexuals, Transsexuality,\nTranssexualism, or Trans” (1997\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n Significant non-trans feminist analyses, following Hale and the\nemergence of transgender studies, include work by Cressida Heyes\n(2003) and Naomi Scheman (1996, 2016), both of whom articulate\ntheoretical bases for solidarity between cis and trans feminists.\nThere are also important instances of cis feminist theorists bringing\ntrans issues directly into their own work as serious interlocutors,\nrather than as thought experiments (Ahmed 2016b; Colebrook 2015;\nShotwell & Sangrey 2008) and collaborating with trans theorists\n(Heyes & Latham 2018). The term “cis” itself has also\nreceived more scholarly attention in the last two decades (Aultman\n2014). While the original intention behind the term was to\ndenaturalize non-trans subject positions, not all scholars agree that\nthe term successfully destabilizes gender norms, particularly insofar\nas such norms are racialized (Enke 2012b). \nMore recently, there have been many new trajectories established at\nthe crossroads of Continental and trans approaches to gender. A number\nof philosophers have written at the intersections of phenomenology and\ntrans studies, particularly in critical phenomenology, which\nemphasizes questions of oppression and power in examining how things\nappear to us in the world (Weiss, Murphy, & Salamon 2020). Ephraim\nDas Janssen uses phenomenology, including the work of Martin\nHeidegger, to examine what transgender experience tells us about\ngender (2017). Megan Burke (2019) takes up Beauvoirian concepts to\nexplore androgyny, trans identity, and agender experience. Gayle\nSalamon draws on the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to develop a\nphenomenology of transphobia in The Life and Death of Latisha\nKing (2018a). Salamon merges a tradition of earlier work in\nphenomenology and trans studies (H. Rubin 1998; Prosser 1998) with\ncritical phenomenology. Tamsin Kimoto (2018) has also used both\nMerleau-Ponty and Frantz Fanon to explore hormonal transition and\ntransphobia. \nAlong similar lines, new work in psychoanalysis and trans studies is\nalso revising longstanding psychoanalytic approaches to sex and\ngender, including coercive and pathologizing theories of trans\nsubjectivity (Elliot 2014), and is using resources in psychoanalysis\nto theorize trans experiences from a less pathologizing perspective\n(Breslow 2017; Carlson 2010; Coffman 2017; Cavanagh 2010). For\nexample, Amy Ray Stewart uses Julia Kristeva’s concept of\n“intimate revolt” to illuminate trans and queer\nexperiences of psychic life (2017). Patricia Gherovici (2017) has\nwritten about trans phenomena and the need to revise psychoanalytic\nconcepts using Lacanian theory and her own clinical experience working\nwith trans people. Relying on both psychoanalytic and phenomenological\nframeworks, Salamon (2010a) has also defended Butler’s account\nof gender against the aforementioned critiques of its treatment of\ntrans experience and developed her own psychoanalytic and\nphenomenological account of a dissonance between a felt sense of\ngender and an external appearance of a body that is attuned to trans\nexperience. \nThere is also a body of work emerging that puts foundational figures\nin Continental feminism into conversation with trans studies. Marie\nDraz (2018) has placed feminist philosophical uses of Nietzsche, such\nas in the work of Butler (1990) and Rosalyn Diprose (2002), into\nconversation with trans scholarship on the institutionalization of\ngender categories, while Tim Johnston (2015) has argued that although\nscholars of gender and sexuality have used Irigarayan resources for\ndiscussing trans and queer issues, Irigaray’s own claim that\nontology is sexed and that there is an impassable limit between the\nsexes conveys an unsalvageable cissexism, or privileging of non-trans\nexperience. In a similar vein, Oli Stephano (2019) critiques Elizabeth\nGrosz’s emphasis on the irreducibility of sexual difference,\nshowing that her ontology invalidates trans embodiment and\nsubjectivities. This critique of Grosz follows earlier work by Eva\nHayward (2017) on the transphobic implications of some of\nGrosz’s feminist materialist arguments. Gayle Salamon also\ncritically examines the way that sexual difference operates as a limit\nto the reimagining of embodiment and materiality in the work of both\nIrigaray and Grosz (Salamon 2010a). María Lugones is another\nfigure of widespread use in Continental feminism who has been\nregularly cited in scholarship on trans issues (Bettcher 2014b;\nDiPietro 2019; Draz 2017a; Malatino 2019). Finally, like Butler, the\nuse of Foucault in trans studies has also changed dramatically over\nthe last several decades. For example, Foucault’s work on types\nof modern power has been used (alongside women of color feminism,\nindigenous scholarship, and numerous other sources) to examine the\nviolence caused by how state institutions administer legal gender\ncategories in sex-segregated institutions and identity documents\n(Spade 2011 [2015]). Foucauldian feminist accounts of prison and\npunishment have also been put into conversation with scholarship\nrooted in trans and gender non-conforming experience (Dilts 2017;\nVitulli 2018; Zurn 2016, 2019). \nTrans studies continues, in different veins, many of the foundational\nquestions of Continental feminism by bringing the tools of Continental\nphilosophy to bear on questions of sex, gender, and sexuality, and\nvice versa, and it continually orients these conversations in new\ndirections. Much of this work is informed by other areas of critical\ntheory (e.g., critical race theory and decolonial theory) and pushes\nthe traditional boundaries of Continental feminism. Recent scholarship\non blackness and trans history, for example, has articulated the\nimportance of developing frameworks capable of understanding the\ndimensions of racialized gender historically and today (Snorton 2017)\nand work on migration and Latinx trans people has highlighted the need\nto attend to both the limits of our political theory and the\nproductive capacities of trans people of color for generating new\nworlds (Pitts 2018). Current conversations about the relationship\nbetween Continental feminism and trans studies must also involve\nattention to the material conditions of the academy itself, as the\ngrowing attention to trans experience in philosophy more broadly has\nnot resulted in more trans voices and trans academics (Bettcher 2018\n(Other Internet Resources); Marvin 2019, 2020). Future directions in\nContinental feminism and trans studies will need to be attentive not\nonly to the intriguing philosophical questions occurring in these\nconversations, but also to the specific contours of the material\nconditions that allow trans scholarship to flourish. \nThis section explores the relationship between Continental feminism\nand Asian American feminist thought, both the tensions between the two\nas well as new directions that this relation brings to Continental\nfeminism. A major point of convergence between the two fields is the\nfocus on lived experience of Asian American women. This section begins\nby discussing the hypervisibility that Asian American women experience\ndue to the specific forms of oppression that they face, namely,\norientalization and the Model Minority myth. It then highlights the\nparadoxical form of invisibility that Asian American feminist\nphenomenologist trace in their body of work. Next, this section\nconsiders the historical position of Asian American women in\ncoalitional feminist projects, especially focusing on the ways in\nwhich Asian American women have been relegated to a\n“tag-along” group. Finally, this section will highlight\nrecent scholarship in Continental feminism that engages with Asian\nAmerican feminist theory and draws upon both Eastern and Western\ntraditions. \nIt must be noted from the outset that “Asian” is an\nexceptionally broad term, and the peoples that are considered\nAsian/Asian American have often changed throughout history. In\naccordance with anthologies by Asian American women that respond to\nthis very issue, this section addresses the identities of women who\ntrace their roots back to East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian\nsubcontinent (Asian Women United of California 1989; The Women of\nSouth Asian Descent Collective 1993). \nIn This Bridge Called My Back (Moraga & Anzaldúa\n1981 [2015]), Asian American thinkers such as Genny Lim, Merle Woo, Nellie\nWong, and Mitsuye Yamada established their positions in feminist\ntheorizing by exploring their own perspectives on topics surrounding\ngendered identity, sexuality, silencing, the feeling of not-belonging,\nand living against stereotypes of Asian American women as docile,\nquiet, agreeable, and submissive. Similarly, in This Bridge We\nCall Home (Anzaldúa & Keating 2002), Minh-ha T. Pham,\nShirley Geok-Lin Lim, and Jid Lee theorize from the specific\nexperiences that they face as Asian American immigrant women, such as\nexploring a connection to an Asian mother who emigrated to the United\nStates, navigating the cultural connection they still hold to a land\nthat they may have never visited, and living in the face of the Model\nMinority myth while also subverting the stereotype. Writings that\ncenter the perspective of the Asian American and diasporic Asian woman\nare essential for Asian American feminist theorizing, for, as Sonia\nShah emphasized, \n[a]n Asian American feminist movement is the only movement\nthat will consistently represent Asian American women’s\ninterests. (1998: xix) \nTwo early anthologies were very important for the formation of Asian\nAmerican feminism: Making Waves (Asian Women United of\nCalifornia [AWUC] 1989) and The Forbidden Stitch (Lim &\nTsutakawa 1989); they both include writings from different ethnic and\nnational backgrounds, specifically Chinese, Japanese, Filipino,\nKorean, Vietnamese, and Indian (Hill-Collins & Bilge 2016: 73). In\na recent volume entitled Asian American Feminisms and Women of\nColor Politics, editors Lynn Fujiwara and Shireen Roshanravan\npresent a series of articles emerging at the intersection of Asian\nAmerican feminist engagement with Women of Color coalition politics,\norganizing around concepts, methods, and epistemic principles central\nto Women of Color feminist scholarship (Fujiwara & Roshanravan\n2018) \nHypervisibility of Asian American women is a central issue in most\nAsian American feminist projects. Some Asian American feminist\ntheorists, such as Robin Zheng, argue that Asian American women are\nhypervisible because they are hypersexualized, orientalized, and\nexoticized. Robin Zheng (2016) discusses the complexities of\nhypervisibility “Why Yellow Fever Isn’t Flattering: A Case\nAgainst Racial Fetishes”. Zheng argues that there is little\ndifference between what is known as “yellow fever”, the\nracial fetishization and preference of Asian women and men, and what\nshe calls the “Mere Preference Argument”, which attempts\nto claim that there is nothing morally wrong with preferring certain\nracialized phenotypic traits; as she shows, despite the origin of a\nracialized fetish, both yellow fever and other racialized fetishes\n“depersonalize and otherize” their subjects (2016: 412).\nZheng shows that these fetishes are not just harmless personal\npreferences, but a set of practices and thought patterns that result\nin negative social impacts for Asian American women. Relatedly, Asian\nAmerican women are also hypervisible due to the “Model Minority\nmyth”, that is, the myth that asserts that Asian Americans are\nuniquely hard-working and thus, the ideal “model”\nminority, especially in contrast with other minority groups. This myth\nmakes Asian American women hypervisible by making them a part of a\ngroup of people who are defined by their ability to achieve upward\nclass mobility (K. Lee 2014). \nParadoxically, Asian American women are also rendered invisible in\nvarious feminist movements and discourses. Asian American feminist\ndiscussions on invisibility differ from other discussions within\nContinental feminism on visibility and feminine erasure due to their\ndual existence as both invisible subjects and hypervisible\nrepresentations of stereotypes. Poet and activist Mitsuye Yamada\nstates that Asian American women are “the visible minority that\nis invisible” (1981b). Yamada means this claim in two ways:\nfirst, in regard to how Asian American women are rendered invisible in\nconversations surrounding women of color oppressions; and second, in\nregard to how the oppressions experienced by Asian American women are\noften invisible to themselves. In order to carve out a space for\nthemselves in feminist theorizing, Asian American women in this book\nshared their stories that demonstrate the struggle of becoming visible\nto oneself while existing in a world that constantly demands\none’s invisibility. Yamada’s explains how she was\ninvisible to herself because she practiced passive resistance while\nbelieving that others did not see her as the stereotype of an Asian\nAmerican women. In order to become visible to herself and others, she\nrealized that she must act in ways, such as displaying anger in\nresponse to sexist and racist acts, that an oppressive gaze would\nclaim was “uncharacteristic” of her as an Asian American\nwoman (1981b: 40). At the same time, the Model Minority myth can also\nparadoxically render Asian American women invisible by making them\nhypervisible as successful paradigms that are perceived as lacking\nexperiences of oppression and violence and thus have no credibility to\nspeak to these lived experiences. \nAs a result of this specific form of invisibility, Asian American\nfeminists proposed new methods of political organization in order to\ninclude the voices of Asian American women in feminist coalitions. The\nsimilarities between writings that span nearly two decades gesture to\none of the many issues faced by Asian American feminism: Asian\nAmerican feminists have often been seen, and arguably still are seen,\nas a group in the background that is simply, as Yamada described,\n“tagging along” in feminist theorization against\noppressions (1981b: 40). In other words, Asian American women are\noften seen as individuals who do not often experience oppressions that\nare specific to their own identities and, therefore, have no place in\nfighting oppression. In response to this, we can see activists such as\nGrace Lee Boggs, who have worked closely with other people of color in\nthe fight against different oppressions (Boggs & Boggs 1974; 1998\n[2016]; Boggs & Kurashige 2011); Lisa Lowe’s essay on\nheterogeneity, hybridity, and multipolicy of Asian American\nwomen’s experiences (Lowe 1991); and more recent Asian American\nfeminist projects that include Asian Americans women in liberatory\nprojects in a manner that does not simply relegate them to tag-along\npositions (Shah 1998; Fujiwara & Roshanravan, 2018). \nA growing number of recent works in Asian American feminism engage\nwith figures and themes in Continental feminism through the framework\nEastern philosophy and the Asian American women’s perspective\nand as such they provide new directions for a genuinely\ntransContinental feminism. For example, building on the discussions\nconcerning gender in Continental feminisms, thinkers such as Kyoo Lee\n(2014) and Robin Wang (2016) have explored different ways that the\ngendered body has been discussed. Engaging with the concept of the\n“dark female animal” (xuapin) in\nDaodejing, Kyoo Lee explores the revolutionary potential of\nxuapin, which she claims possesses a gender-bending power.\nLee argues that xuapin demonstrates \nin a sense, superiority of femaleness and femininity –as\nthe norm, albeit invisible and inaudible \nand that it is \ngender-bending: female and not female at once, heterosexualized and\nnot at once. (K. Lee 2014: 59) \nWang investigates yin-yang gender dynamics through a variety of both\nEastern and Western sources in order to answer whether yin-yang gender\nconstruction allows for gender equality. Alluding to Continental\nfeminists who wrote on gender such as Simone de Beauvoir, Judith\nButler, and Luce Irigaray, Wang discusses an exploration of gender\nthrough a Chinese framework (the yin-yang) that does not make a clear\ndistinction between sex and gender. Wang argues that yin-yang gender\nconstruction offers a dynamic and fluid description of gender\nrelationships (Wang 2016: 224). \nThis entry has listed a number of ways in which Continental approaches\nand figures are used to address feminist issues; we have attempted\nboth to describe some of the ongoing research areas in Continental\nfeminism and to point out new directions it has been taking over the\npast decades. However, this list remains incomplete as we have been\nunable to account for all of the important work underway. A more\ncomplete entry would need to include projects on the intersection\nbetween Continental feminism and critical disability studies,\nindigenous feminisms, and new materialisms and humanisms. Furthermore,\nwe do not mean to suggest that there is no overlap or intersection\nbetween the topics or figures grouped under each section heading here.\nLastly, there is certainly ongoing work of which we are not aware that\nis already making an impact on the present and future of feminist\nscholarship. We thus conclude here not with a summative statement\ndefining Continental feminism but rather by reflecting on the material\nconditions of Continental feminism. \nWhen Linda Martín Alcoff addressed the Eastern American\nPhilosophical Association in 2012, she reflected on the tension and\nissues within disciplinary philosophy and urged philosophers to\n“apply our diagnostic impulses to ourselves” (Alcoff 2013:\n43). A necessary aspect of such praxis for Continental feminists in\nlight of the genealogies considered here is exemplified by Audre Lorde\nwho, speaking on the “Personal is Political Panel” at the\nSecond Sex Conference in 1979, stated \nI urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of\nknowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any\ndifference that lives there. See whose face it wears. (Lorde 1984a:\n101) \nLorde calls feminists to enact a humble and frank confrontation with\ntheir own embodied lives and senses of self in the context of each\nperson’s differential implication in racist, sexist,\nheterosexist, classist and ableist power. Rather than imagining that\none puts on one’s thinking hat and reflects “as a\ntheorist” and then take it off and acts “as a regular\nperson”, Continental feminisms suggest that the subject who\ntheorizes is themself always an embodied subject: Kris Sealey reminds\nus that “Continental methods oftentimes refract differently\nacross race and gender axes” and that for this reason,\nContinental feminists ought “to be intentional about the\nrelationship they occupy, quite simultaneously, to racial and gender\nliberation” (Sealey 2017: 166). As this entry has shown, the\ndiversity of Continental feminist thought has been developed through\nthe thoughtful negotiation of many different struggles. For the\nimagined community of Continental feminism to continue to grow and\nsupport these projects, space must continually be made for new\npractitioners. Since, as we put above, Continental feminism is less\nconcerned with changing a woman’s place in a symbolic or social\nsystem, and more on upending that system itself, members of this\nacademic community must continue to do the work that will make it\npossible to learn from each other. Only in this way Continental\nfeminism can be opened up fully to its interdisciplinary\npotential.","contact.mail":"jxmcauliffe@ualr.edu","contact.domain":"ualr.edu"},{"date.published":"2020-11-10","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/femapproach-continental/","author1":"Dilek Huseyinzadegan","author2":"Jana McAuliffe","entry":"femapproach-continental","body.text":"\n\n\n\n\n[Editor’s Note: The following new entry replaces the\n former entry\n on this topic by the previous author.]\n\n\n\n\nContinental feminism denotes an approach to feminist issues in\nphilosophy and the world both via figures and methods of what\nis called the “Continental” tradition in philosophy\nand via critical interventions into this tradition.\nContinental tradition in philosophy today refers to a set of\nnineteenth and twentieth century figures and theoretical traditions\nfrom mainland Europe, arising as a way for English-speaking\nphilosophers in the United States to distinguish their approach to\nphilosophical questions from that of the analytic tradition. By\nutilizing one or more of the signature schemas of the Continental\ntradition, Continental feminists contribute to problem areas ranging\nfrom metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, and social and\npolitical philosophy. Continental feminism thus refers to a body and\nstyle of work consisting of feminist interpretations of mainstream\nContinental figures (largely from what is called “Continental\nEurope”, such as Hegel, Levinas, Derrida, Foucault); feminist\nuses of psychoanalysis, phenomenology, deconstruction, genealogy, and\ncritical theory; and of interpretations of European feminists and\nfigures such as de Beauvoir, Irigaray, Arendt, and Kristeva. Note,\nhowever, that Europe is not and has never been a continent, and in\nthis sense, Continental feminism, like Continental philosophy, is more\nof an imagined community of approaches, figures, and traditions, or an\numbrella concept, rather than a precise term.\n\n\nElaine Miller points out that the term “Continental\nfeminism” came into circulation in the United States in 2007\n(Miller 2017); as she defines it, Continental feminism\n\n\n\n\ninvolves a commitment to the historicity of philosophical concepts,\nincluding the sometimes-uncomfortable contexts of their production, a\nbelief that it is through the examination of texts that the genealogy\nof ideas can be traced and resources for critically responding to them\ncan be formulated, and that the “canon” is subject to\nconstant re-interrogation and reconfiguration. (Miller 2017: 154)\n\n\n\nIn Allison Stone’s terms,\n\n\n\n\ndescribing the world as it really is—not as an aggregate of\nstatic items but as an ever-shifting web of relations—calls for\nunfamiliar, difficult language. (Stone 2015: 4)\n\n\n\nA distinguishing feature of Continental feminism, Miller and Stone\nagree, is that it\n\n\n\n\nembodies a refusal to prima facie privilege clarity and\nsuccinctness of argument over acknowledging through language the\ncomplexity, difficulty, and problematic nature of the issues being\naddressed. (Miller 2017: 154; Stone 2015: 2)\n\n\n\nAs a way of beginning to address the Euro- and U.S.-centric biases of\ncontinental philosophy, a transContinental turn in Continental\nfeminism proposed by Kyoo Lee and Alyson Cole aims to incorporate a\nglobal view of feminist issues and theories, where\n\n\n\n\n“trans” serves as a marker for the constant geo-cultural\nflows of ideas in transit, as in “transatlantic”,\n“transpacific”, “transoceanic”, etc., as well\nas for cutting-edge works, conversations, and debates in\ntrans-critical, cultural, disciplinary, human, gender, genic, lingual,\nmedial, national fields, etc., and as trans*feminist discourses. (Cole\nand Lee 2019: iv)\n\n\n\nAccordingly, this entry will take Continental feminism to include the\nfollowing distinct yet related set of issues and areas: (1) the\nfeminist use of figures, traditions, and approaches of\nphenomenology/existentialism, psychoanalysis, post-structuralism\n(deconstruction and genealogy), and critical theory; (2) critical\ninterventions into the assumptions about sex, gender, class, race,\nability, religion, and age endemic to European philosophy; and (3)\ninterpretations of hitherto underrepresented figures and methods of\nfeminism from a transContinental and transAtlantic perspective that\nestablish new, abandoned, or previously delegitimated genealogies for\nfeminist thought.\n\n\nIt is important to note that not all Continental feminists are\nphilosophers or work in Philosophy departments; thus, Continental\nfeminism is interdisciplinary and its practitioners come from various\nfields. As this subfield developed in the early 2000s, there were\nalready disciplinary, intra-disciplinary and extra-disciplinary\nprojects that explored feminist issues by utilizing phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, deconstructive, and critical theoretical approaches.\nRather than organizing this entry around the signature schemas of the\nContinental tradition and subsuming ongoing work that uses these\napproaches under them, this entry will locate crucial genealogies for\nContinental feminism in the work of Black feminists, post- and\ndecolonial feminists, women of color feminists, Asian American\nfeminists, trans feminists, and queer feminists. We take these\ngenealogies as central to the past, present, and future of Continental\nfeminism, and accordingly this entry is organized topically, in order\nto outline the ways that Continental feminisms have developed in\nconversation and in tension with these interdisciplinary projects.\nThese projects have been unearthing the cissexist,\nsexist/misogynistic, racist, heterosexist, classist, ageist, ableist,\ncolonial commitments of philosophy as a discipline and a professional\nfield as they are simultaneously expanding, transforming, and pushing\nthe concerns and methods of Continental thought in interdisciplinary\niterations. Indeed, what distinguishes Continental feminism clearly\nfrom Analytic feminism are its call for interdisciplinarity and its\nbelief that feminist omissions themselves can become sites from which\nnew projects are launched, as will be highlighted throughout this\nentry. As such, Continental feminism starts with the premise that\nEuropean or Anglo-American norms and categories of thought can be\ninterpreted, critiqued, and re-envisioned or abandoned for feminist\npurposes.\n\nContinental feminists share with other Continental thinkers an\ninterest in close reading that uses careful exegesis to unpack the\ndeep meanings of texts through attention to their linguistic and\nhistorical specificity. However, to utilize a philosophical tradition\nthat has largely presumed rather than explored the impacts of sex and\ngender on material life, continental feminists often read irreverently\nto focus on concerns that traditional philosophy might push to the\nside. While all feminist theorizing deals with questions of power,\nsubjectivity, and culture, Continental feminist approaches to these\nissues are often critical in the sense that they explore how\nexternal power dynamics affect the constitution of inner experiences,\nand in turn how embodied and subjective re-articulations of power can\nand should transform the world in the pursuit of justice. This\nfrequently involves taking lived experience as a crucial component of\ncritical philosophy; as Gail Weiss puts it, \nonly by interrogating the “ordinary” dimensions of\nexperience is it possible to arrive at an understanding of the dynamic\nforces that give meaning to individual lives and that are both the\nobstacle and the vehicle to achieving lasting social change. (Weiss\n2008: 5) \nTo present a broad sketch of characteristics of continental feminism\nthroughout its history, this section focuses on methods that\nContinental feminists use to engage embodied experience in their\nprojects. The gendered critique of the traditional Western\nphilosophical tendency to dichotomize the body that feels and the mind\nthat thinks is an ongoing theme in continental feminism (see entry on\n feminist perspectives on the body).\n The account presented here is not at all complete, as the specific\naims and methods of such feminist projects differ widely, most\nimportantly in terms of how an analysis of sex and gender is impacted\nby other aspects of embodied experience such as race, sexuality, and\nability. This section first addresses some ways that continental\nfeminists trouble a mind-body distinction by engaging affect and\nemotion in their work. Next, it explores two examples of how\ncontinental traditions, psychoanalysis and phenomenology, are made\ninto critical resources in Continental feminist projects. Finally, it\npresents work that engages an ongoing critique of culture and everyday\nexperience as an important aspect of feminist theorizing. \nMany Continental feminists focus on the overlaying of mental and\nphysical experience via the concepts of affect, emotion, and feeling.\nAffect is described by Teresa Brennan as “the physiological\nshift accompanying a judgment” (Brennan 2004: 5). The\n“transmission of affect” describes the way that one can\ncatch the mood of another; this experience is “social in origin\nbut biological and physical in effect” (Brennan 2004: 3).\nBrennan describes transmission as when the “emotions or\naffects of one person, and the enhancing or depressing energies these\naffects entail” pass from one person to another (Brennan 2004:\n3). Affect is thus one way to describe how social experience impacts\nthe corporeal life of subjects through the transference of energy. In\nBrennan’s case, affective states are directional; they\nare not neutral but push or press on subjects. At the same time, terms\nlike affect and feeling might be distinguished based on the extent to\nwhich one considers affect to be already coded with or influenced by\nsocial significance for a subject (see Ahmed 2010: 230–231,\nSeigworth & Gregg 2010, esp. 5–8). \nContinental feminist projects on emotion often analyze historically\ncontextualized experiences. Ann Cvetkovich engages with trauma in a\nway that \nfocuses on the everyday and the insidious…and situates it in a\nsocial and cultural frame rather than a medical one. (Cvetkovich 2007:\n464) \nShe then presents a political account of depression that\ndepathologizes such negatively-connotated emotional experiences so\nthat they can become more visible in public and thus create a\npotential foundation for community (Cvetkovich 2007: 460). In The\nCultural Politics of Emotion, Sara Ahmed argues that emotion is\ngenerated when meaning is produced across social-political\ninteraction; these feelings create the boundaries of affinity groups\nand impact self-understanding. In this analysis, emotions help\nconstitute what a person understands as their objective condition, and\nthus \nemotions are not “in” either the individual or the social,\nbut produce the very surfaces and boundaries that allow all kinds of\nobjects to be delineated. (Ahmed 2004 [2014: 10]) \nBecause feeling is often ambivalent and multi-faceted, rather than in\nspite of this complexity, social critics who attend to how affects are\nemployed and manipulated in both textual and social-political\nargumentation can produce readings that trouble an easy dichotomy\nbetween what is a “good” and what a “bad”\nexperience. \nPsychoanalytically-informed projects use concepts such as trauma,\nmourning, melancholia, and abjection to analyze embodied experience\n(Irigaray 1974 [1985]; Spillers 1996; Butler 1997; Felman 2002; Oliver\n2004; entry on\n psychoanalytic feminism).\n They frequently engage aesthetics as an aspect of social critique\n(Chanter 2008; Kristeva 1980 [1982]; Miller 2014). This allows a\nsymptomatic reading of feeling to be interpreted back against the\nsocial order, as is seen in Judith Butler’s Frames of\nWar. In this text, Butler analyzes what makes a life grievable\nand argues that the questions of who appears as a human, whose life\nshould be protected, and who does not are all figured in advance of\nany particular political decision through a pre-reflexive manipulation\nof affect (Butler 2009 [2016: 64]). Supplementing democratic theory\nwith Continental feminist interpretations, Noëlle McAfee deploys\nKristeva and the resources in her thought, as well as psychoanalysis,\nspecifically on the issues of affect and the notion of the\n“political unconscious” (McAfee 2000 and 2008). \nCritical phenomenologists draw on the methods of phenomenology to\ndemonstrate “the multiple ways in which power moves through our\nbodies and our lives” (Introduction, Weiss, Murphy, &\nSalamon 2020: xiv). Lisa Guenther understands critical phenomenology\nas both a way of doing philosophy and a way of approaching political\nactivism (Guenther 2020: 15). Most characteristically, Guenther argues\nthat critical phenomenology employs reworked versions of \nMerleau-Ponty’s concept of the body schema to account for\ngendered and sexual schemas (Simone de Beauvoir, Iris Marion Young,\nTalia Mae Bettcher, Gayle Salamon), racialized schemas (Frantz Fanon,\nLewis Gordon, Sara Ahmed, George Yancy, Alia Al-Saji), disability\nschemas (Kay Toombs, Lisa Diedrich, Havi Carel), and other aspects of\nlived experience. (Guenther 2020: 13–14) \nA recent volume edited by Gail Weiss, Ann V, Murphy, and Gayle\nSalamon, entitled 50 Concepts for a Critical* Phenomenology\n(2020), shows that many of the central concepts of critical\nphenomenology intersect with Continental feminism. \nFinally, considering the social and political import of inner states\nand the centering of quotidian experiences of power enable Continental\nfeminists to explore culture as it develops. For instance, Shannon\nSullivan’s Good White People: The Problem with Middle-Class\nAnti-Racism focuses on “the personal side of whiteness and\nwhite privilege” with attention to the embodied experience of\nrace (S. Sullivan 2014: 19) to critique the ways through which white\nliberals set themselves up as altruistic, “good” white\npeople through, e.g., hypocritical modes of tolerance that maintain\nwhite domination (S. Sullivan 2014: 4). Robin James’\nResilience & Melancholy explores pop music as a way to\nanalyze the impact of neoliberal biopolitics; she combines music\ntheory with psychoanalytic and Foucauldian philosophies to critique\ncomplicity with multi-racial white supremacist patriarchy and argues\nthat music, e.g., Rihanna’s, offer strategies for countering\nthis oppressive power (R. James 2015). In Irony in the Age of\nEmpire: Comic Perspectives on Philosophy and Freedom, Cynthia\nWillett engages film and stand-up comedy to articulate a libidinal\nunderstanding of freedom that can counter the liberal paradigms of\nindividuality with a sense of freedom defined “in terms of\nequality and solidarity” (Willett 2008: 14). Erin Tarver\nanalyzes practices of sports fans, with particular attention to\nfootball, baseball, and basketball fans in the American South, to\nbetter understand how individual and group identities are maintained\nto “…shore up, reproduce, and very occasionally, subvert\nracial, sexual and gender hierarchies” (Tarver 2017: 3). This\nwork is often interdisciplinary, and some of these projects work at\nthe intersection between continental and pragmatist feminisms (see\nentry on\n intersections between pragmatist and continental feminism). \nSimultaneously reading carefully and irreverently, continental\nfeminists deepen the philosophical account of experience by\nintegrating historically contextualized feeling into their projects,\nusing and transmuting philosophical traditions and traditional\nfigures, and interrogating everyday experiences in their embodied and\ncultural specificity. This work insists that meaning and social order\nfunction through unrecognized cooptation, subordination or exclusion\nin various intersectional constellations. In general, continental\nfeminisms are less concerned with changing a woman’s place in a\nsymbolic or social system, and more focused on upending such systems,\nas will be explored in more detail in the following sections. \nThis section on the convergences between Black and Continental\nfeminist thought begins with a discussion about the history of Black\nfeminist scholarship utilizing existential/phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, critical, and hermeneutic approaches. It then\nintroduces intersectionality as the major heuristic for Black feminist\ntheorizing, and concludes by highlighting emerging areas and\nintersections between Black studies and Black feminist Continental\nthought. \nBlack women have long been contributors to the Continental\nphilosophical tradition. One may argue that their contributions to\nprofessional philosophy started after the graduation of the first\nBlack woman to earn the PhD in philosophy, Joyce Mitchell Cook, who\ncompleted the degree in 1965 from Princeton University. Even prior to\nthis date, however, Black women engaged in projects that we can\nrecognize as Continental feminist projects. Importantly, \nmany Black intellectuals in the United States going back (at least) to\nthe nineteenth century offered what are now described as existential,\nphenomenological, and/or genealogical analyses of race and racism.\n(Belle 2012, 329 fn. 1) \nThese contributions did not always occur in the form of traditional\nphilosophical discussions, nor are they always created by those who\nhave professional degrees in philosophy, which is certainly true of\nthe nineteenth and early twentieth century thinkers, Sojourner Truth,\nMaria W. Stewart, and\n Anna Julia Cooper. \nBlack feminists’ contributions to Continental philosophy\ndemonstrate the ways in which their voices are crucial to both shaping\nand expanding the discipline. Kathryn Sophia Belle, Donna-Dale\nMarcano, and Maria del Guadalupe Davidson edited Convergences:\nBlack Feminism and Continental Philosophy (del Guadalupe et al.\n2010), the only text at the publication of this entry that addresses\nboth these topics simultaneously. For the editors, the concept of\nconvergence is demonstrated by the natural, historical, and necessary\nengagement of Black women with Continental philosophy. Belle\nwrites, \nBlack feminist and womanist thinkers inevitably address the very same\nissues of agency, identity, alienation, power, and so on that are\nraised in much recent Continental philosophy. Likewise, from Immanuel\nKant to the feminist thinkers of the present, Continental philosophy\nhas engaged, to some extent, with issues of race and gender. (2010:\n5) \nThe Black feminist tradition in Continental philosophy demonstrates\nthat Black women are not strangers nor enemies of Continental\nphilosophy; rather, their unique theoretical positioning affords them\nthe opportunity to utilize, challenge, and expand the tradition. \nBlack feminist thinkers contribute to Continental feminist thought in\nat least two ways. First, they engage directly with Continental\nfigures and theories. For example, Lorraine Hansberry comments that\nSimone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex (1949, translated\nin 1953) was arguably the “most important work of this\ncentury” (1957 [1995: 129 and 133]), and Antillean thinker\nPaulette Nardal draws on both features of the Harlem Renaissance and\nexistentialist thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre to provide a\nphenomenological and genealogical account of how the Black race, and\nAntilleans in particular, have come to understand their own notion of\nrace consciousness in “The Awakening of Race\nConsciousness” (1932). More recently, they engage with canonical\nfigures and ideologies of Continental philosophy, as in the work of\nKathryn Sophia Belle on Hannah Arendt (2014) or Kris Sealey on\nEmmanuel Levinas (2014). Second, regardless of their professional\nPhilosophy degrees or lack thereof, Black feminist thinkers utilize\nthe tools of the Continental tradition as part of their\ninterdisciplinary approaches, as in the use of Foucault in the work of\nSylvia Wynter (2003) and the use of Freud, Lacan, and psychoanalysis\nin the work of Hortense Spillers (1996). \nBlack feminist thinkers have frequently used intersectionality as an\neffective entry-point into conversations with the Continental\ntradition. Intersectionality is a Black feminist theory that describes\nthe oppression that Black women experience as a result of lying at the\nnexus of simultaneously impactful identities, such as that of race,\ngender, class, and sexuality. As such, intersectionality can be used\nas a phenomenological tool to describe Black women’s lived\nexperience of oppression. While legal theorist Kimberlé\nCrenshaw coined the term in 1989, the theory has been articulated at\nleast since the mid-nineteenth century in Sojourner Truth’s\nproclamation, “Ain’t I a Woman?” (1851). In the\nspeech, Truth highlights that Black women are treated with less\nrespect than white women while bearing the same burdens of racism as\nBlack men. Anna Julia Cooper wrote that Black women are \nconfronted by a both a woman question and a race problem and is as yet\nan unknown or an unacknowledged factor in both. (1892 [1988: 134]) \nIn their collective statement from April 1977, The Combahee River\nCollective argues that \nBlack feminism [is] the logical political movement to combat the\nmanifold and simultaneous oppressions that all women of color face \nand that \n[t]here is also undeniably a personal genesis for Black feminism, that\nis, the political realization that comes from the seemingly personal\nexperiences of individual Black women’s lives. (Taylor 2017: 15\nand 17) \nIntersectionality is thus a hallmark of Black feminist thought because\nit prioritizes the lived experiences of Black women. In doing so, it\nsupplies the tools to think about the extent to which one’s\nconsciousness the world is informed by experiences of racism, sexism,\nclassism, and homophobia. \nIn addition to its utility in explaining Black women’s lived\nexperience, intersectionality also provides tools for Black feminists\nto critique the presumed whiteness and bourgeois-class status of\nfeminism and to combat various forms of oppression and violence. Thus,\nintersectionality is also key to critiquing phenomenological analysis,\nthat is, analysis of lived experiences and feminist movements through\nthe lens of sociopolitical identities such as race, sex, and class.\nAngela Davis’s text Women, Race, & Class (1981) is\nan early model of this approach; it details the history of U.S.\nwomen’s movements and their consideration, or lack thereof, of\nthe class-based and racial dimensions of womanhood. Texts such as\nPatricia Hill-Collins’s Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge,\nConsciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment (1990 [2015]) underscore\nthe ways in which Black women create their own epistemological\nstandpoint as a result of their lived experiences. In the 1970s to\n90s, when Black women’s contributions to academia reached its\nzenith, Black feminist scholars such as Barbara Christian in\n“The Race for Theory” (1988), Toni Morrison in Playing\nin the Dark (1992), and Audre Lorde in “The Master’s\nTools will Never Dismantle the Master’s House” (1984a) and\n“Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference”\n(1984b) exemplified Black women’s critiques of theoretical\napproaches that adopt a “neutral” stance toward feminist\nmovements where neutral meant presuming all women to be white,\nmiddle-class, young or middle-aged, and heterosexual (see also Hull,\nBell-Scott, & Smith 1982). \nCurrent Black feminist work centers Black epistemologies,\npractices, and concepts. The burgeoning scholarship of Black women\nphilosophers continue to push the boundaries of Continental feminism,\nas in the work of Lindsey Stewart’s work on Black feminist\npractices of freedom (2017), Camisha Russell’s work on the\nissues of race and gender in assisted reproduction (2018), and Axelle\nKarera’s work, which focuses on the Anthropocene and\nantiBlackness (2019). In addition to engaging with the canonical\nfigures of the Continental tradition, Black thinkers harvest\nphilosophy from their own perspective and experience of the world as\nwell as their theoretical archives. Much of this more recent work\nintersects with Black Studies. The work of Black thinkers from\ndisciplines other than philosophy are intersecting with Continental\nphilosophical and feminist approaches, as seen in the works of such as\nSaidiya Hartman (1997, 2007, and 2019), Christina Sharpe (2016),\nRizvana Bradley (2014 and 2018), Jennifer Nash (2019), Denise Ferreira\nda Silva (2007, 2014, and 2018), Riley Snorton (2017), Selamawit\nTerrefe (2020), and Zakiyyah Iman Jackson (2020). \nContinental feminist approaches to questions on colonialism revolve\naround two main sets of investigations: on the one hand, the\ninterrogation of the hegemony of the West as an abstract category that\nis deployed strategically to exclude and inferiorize communities\ndeemed Non-Western (Spivak 1999; Narayan 1997; Mohanty 1984), and on\nthe other hand, the question of coloniality, which focuses on the\npolitical and epistemic ordering of the globe starting with the\ncolonization of the Americas (Lugones 2003; Wynter 1995; Ortega 2016).\nTo this end, these approaches both use schemas of the Continental\ntradition (such as phenomenology, psychoanalysis, genealogy,\ndeconstruction, and poststructuralism) and call into question the\ngeographic and racial assumptions that underlie Continental\nphilosophy. For both of these approaches, an analysis of colonialism\nis inseparable from the political aim of challenging and undoing the\ncolonial world. This challenge entails deconstructing the categories\nof the colonially determined globe (such as East-West,\nWestern-Non-Western, Developed-Underdeveloped, First World-Third\nWorld, North-South) through focusing on the concrete lived experiences\nof individuals and communities. This section focuses on the general\ncharacteristics of these two Continental feminist approaches taken up\nunder the rough categories of postcolonial and decolonial feminisms,\nwith the former focusing on the Western-Non-western divide that marks\ncolonial relations, and the latter on the North-South dialogues that\nemerge within the relations of coloniality. It concludes by\nhighlighting coalitional thinking, a fundamental aspect of both post-\nand decolonial feminist approaches. \nPostcolonial feminist approaches maintain that in order to interrogate\nthe hegemony of the West, it is necessary to deconstruct the ways in\nwhich it is deployed to exclude the non-Western subject. Furthermore,\nsuch deployment is always a strategic one, insofar as the\n“West” is not a concrete geographical category, and the\nparadigm of Western subjectivity is continuously built by demarcating\nthose who do not fit in it. Postcolonial feminisms are\ninterdisciplinary and not limited to the field of philosophy, and they\nchallenge the inscription of the gender, racial, and geographic\ncategories that underlie the hegemony of the Western subject. In doing\nso, Continental feminist approaches engage with figures from\npoststructuralism and critical theory (such as Foucault, Derrida,\nDeleuze and Adorno), and they deploy methods such as genealogy and\ndeconstruction (Spivak 1988; Mohanty 1984), in order to question the\nunderlying geographic and gendered assumptions of these methods. In\n“Can the Subaltern Speak?” for example, Gayatri\nChakravorty Spivak engages with French poststructuralism and questions\nthe paradigms of speech/reason that deny the very possibility of\ncapacities such as resistance for those that do not fit within the\ngeographic, racialized, and gendered boundaries of Western\nSubjectivity (Spivak 1988). In doing so, she highlights the ways in\nwhich poststructuralism relies upon the very categories (of speech,\nreason, or universal subjectivity) that it ostensibly critiques. \nThe tension highlighted by Spivak, in which the Western Subject\nconstitutes both the dominant subject and the only subject capable of\nresistance, underlies postcolonial feminisms’ critique of the\nalignment of the West with modernity and progress (McClintock 1995;\nStoler 1995). Chandra Talpade Mohanty, in “Under Western\nEyes”, criticizes the hegemony of Western approaches in defining\nthe scope and goals of feminist struggles. Issues such as the veil\ndebate, in this sense, point to the political and phenomenological\nracialization of the Non-Western woman (Al-Saji 2010; Sheth 2006). At\nthe same time, Uma Narayan draws attention to the risks of fetishizing\nthe category of the Non-Western and highlights how such a\nfetishization remains within colonially determined divisions (Narayan\n1997; Narayan & Harding 2000). Namita Goswami, in Subjects\nThat Matter, develops heterogeneity as a kind of conceptual\ncontinuity between feminism, philosophy, and postcolonial studies,\nwhich allows for an understanding of difference beyond oppositional\nand antagonistic terms (Goswami 2019). \nDecolonial feminisms emerge primarily from the U.S. Latina and Latinx\ncontexts and have a different genealogy, insofar as they are in\ndialogue with Latin American Philosophy, Continental Philosophy,\nAnglo-American Thought, and especially U.S. Women of Color feminisms.\nFocusing on North-South dialogues, Latin American and Latina Feminist\nphilosophers such as Ofelia Schutte engage with the work of figures\nsuch as Nietzsche, Kristeva, and Irigaray while developing Latin\nAmerican philosophy as a field in U.S. academic philosophy (Schutte\n1984; 1993; for more, see the entry on\n Latin American feminism).\n Linda Martín Alcoff, for example, brings Latin American\nPhilosophy (particularly the work of Enrique Dussel) in dialogue with\nexistentialism and poststructuralism in order to develop the framework\nfor Latinx feminisms (Alcoff 2006, 2015). \nOne of the major frameworks of decolonial feminisms is “the\ncoloniality of power”, a term first introduced by Aníbal\nQuijano, and defined as “the social classification of the\nworld’s population around the idea of race” (Quijano 2000:\n1). In this sense, the colonization of the Americas is not only a\nhistorical moment, but also the emergence of race and the subsequent\nreorganization of the globe in accordance with what Walter Mignolo\ncalls “the colonial difference”, denoting the abstract\npositioning of Europe as the global hegemonic power (Mignolo 2002).\nDecolonial feminisms take an intersectional approach to the\ncoloniality of power and investigate, as María Lugones says,\n“the emergence of hegemonic gender arrangements along\n‘racial’ lines” starting with the colonization of\nthe Americas (Lugones 2007: 190). Decolonial feminists such as Lugones\nand Wynter bring poststructuralist critique in dialogue with Latin\nAmerican philosophy and argue that dominant gender arrangements\nthemselves are colonial; these arrangements, such as patriarchy,\nheterosexualism, or gender dimorphism mark concrete historical\nprocesses of the racial inscription of gender norms, starting from and\nwith the coloniality of power (Lugones 2008; Oyěwùmí\n2007; Wynter 2006). \nDecolonial feminisms’ emphasis on historical critique is\ninseparable from a concern with the concrete lived experiences of\nwomen of color (Moraga and Anzaldúa 1981 [2015]; Pérez\n1999; Lugones 2007, Sandoval 2000). Gloria Anzaldúa, in\nBorderlands/La Frontera, emphasizes bordered thinking as the\nunderlying logic of contemporary systems of oppression, and she\nformulates the resistances of hybrid identities that emerge both out\nof and in response to such bordered thinking (Anzaldúa 1987).\nMariana Ortega develops Latina feminist phenomenology in emphasizing\nboth the lived experience of borderlands and exile, and the\npossibilities of resistance by developing “home-tactics”\nin and through these experiences (Ortega 2016). \nCoalitional thinking is a fundamental aspect of both post- and\ndecolonial feminist approaches. Mohanty calls for coalitions across\nborders in thinking through the concrete lived experiences and\nemphasizes the importance of situated and local struggles in\nunderstanding hegemonic power relations.  Moraga and Anzaldúa,\nin their coedited collection This Bridge Called My Back, call\nfor concrete and sustained coalitions that are based on an\nintersectional understanding of women’s lives, rather than\nabstract calls for sisterhood. Decolonial feminists such as Lugones,\nChela Sandoval, Ortega, and Emma Pérez, maintain that\ncoalitional thinking cannot be an afterthought for any anti- or\ndecolonial struggles (Pérez 1999; Sandoval 2000). \nAs Continental feminism expands, it involves further conversations\nwith and in-between these approaches. The questions around the\n“continent” of Continental feminism, as well as how such a\ncontinent is situated within the colonial geographic boundaries of the\nWest and the Global North, continue to be challenged. As spaces for\nsuch a flow of ideas open up, further conversations on the possibility\nof coalition, as well as on challenging the limits of colonial thought\ncontinue to reshape the face of Continental feminism. \nThe relationship between Continental feminism and queer theory is\nsimultaneously productive and fraught. While far from exhaustive, this\nentry will first highlight some of the overlapping figures and\napproaches between the two fields, including examples of scholarship\nat their intersections. It will then briefly introduce one account of\nthe tension between them. Finally, it will close with some reflections\non the shared problems across these fields, including their\nhistorically white and Anglo-Eurocentric approaches, as well as how\nrecent work in queer of color critique aligns with and points to new\ndirections in Continental feminism. \nIn the late 1980s and the early 1990s, “queer” emerged as\na reclamation of a homophobic slur and a rallying cry for a coalition\nof the marginalized against the tyranny of the normal (Barker &\nScheele 2016; D. Hall & Jagose 2012; Warner 1993; Sedgwick 1993;\nAnzaldúa 1991 [2009]). Formed in the crucible of the AIDS\ncrisis, which sharpened the need to understand the violence\nexperienced by people excluded by norms related to gender and\nsexuality, “queer” was meant to bring attention to the\nrange of sexual/gender practices deemed outside the purview of the\nnormal. In one genealogy of queer theory, the field develops this\nearly activist reclamation of the term queer into a wide-reaching\ncritique of how norms operate in and through dominant\nconceptualizations of identity. Given this motivating impulse of\ndeconstruction, or of denaturalizing categories such as sexuality, it\nis perhaps of no surprise that queer theory has historically been a\nfield well-populated with figures (e.g., Lacan, Foucault, Derrida) and\nmethodological approaches (poststructuralism, psychoanalysis,\nphenomenology) that have been associated with Continental philosophy,\nespecially twentieth century European philosophy. \nQueer theory frequently draws on, critiques, and expands the ideas of\nmany figures and approaches that are seen as early progenitors of\nContinental feminism (e.g., Beauvoir, Irigaray, Kristeva, feminist\nphenomenology, feminist poststructuralism, critical theory,\npsychoanalytic theory). As Jagose (2009) points out, however, the\ncritique of normative identity categories was not invented by queer\ntheory, given that feminist scholarship has a rich history of\nradically disrupting the category of women along lines of race and\nsexuality. Moreover, the lines between feminism and queer theory are\nhistorically blurred. For example, Judith Butler—who is often\ncited as an originator of queer theory—explicitly marks her\nearly work as occurring in the intersection of these fields (as well\nas a number of other critical discourses) (1997). In Gender\nTrouble (1990) and Bodies that Matter (1993), Butler\ndraws on Continental feminist figures such as Irigaray, Beauvoir, and\nKristeva, and methods ranging from psychoanalysis to poststructuralism\nand phenomenology to develop a simultaneously queer and feminist\ntheoretical lens focused on understanding the relationship between\ngender and sexuality, as well as the operation of norms and identity\ncategories more broadly (Salih 2002). \nA second major figure in the relationship between Continental feminism\nand queer theory is Michel Foucault, who has been extensively used in\nboth queer and Continental (and specifically poststructuralist)\nfeminist theory, but who (as opposed to Butler) did not explicitly use\nthe terms queer and feminist. While a larger account of the connection\nbetween Foucault and queer theory is beyond the scope of this entry,\nthe relationship is a rich one. In the late 1980s, Foucault’s\nThe History of Sexuality, Volume One was read\nheavily by activists and scholars questioning dominant narratives\naround sexuality and identity (Halperin 1995); Foucault’s work\nwas also influential not only for Judith Butler’s Gender\nTrouble (1990) but also for another text often cited as\nfoundational for queer theory, Eve Sedgwick’s Epistemology\nof the Closet (1990 [2008]). \nFoucault’s genealogical approach to identity, including his\nexploration of the histories and models of power at work in modern\nconceptions of sexuality, has been important for a number of\ncontemporary scholars working at the intersections of feminism and\nqueer theory (Huffer 2010 and 2020; Russell 2010; Sawicki 2005;\nSchotten 2018; Winnubst 2006). For example, Ladelle McWhorter (1999)\ntakes up Foucault’s account of ethics as a practice of the self,\nor how we work on ourselves to become particular kinds of people,\nthrough a queer framework that resists expected developmental\ntrajectories and normative timelines of a life (e.g., heterosexual\ncoupling resulting in marriage and children). And in a different vein,\nJasbir Puar (2007) has drawn on Foucault’s theories of power (as\nwell as a wide range of interdisciplinary theory including\npostcolonial feminist theory) to analyze the relationship between\ncontemporary biopower and homonationalism, or how certain\n“good” gay and lesbian subjects, by aligning themselves\nwith U.S. imperialism, are welcomed into the nation-state. \nFigures associated with Continental feminism who do not necessarily\nmark themselves or their work as queer have also been used in queer\ntheoretical projects, just as feminists have historically done with\nany number of non-feminist philosophers. For example, queer studies\nscholars have explored the relative absence of Irigaray in queer\ntheory, argued for the queer resources of her thinking (Huffer 2013;\nWinnubst 2006), called attention to the potential use of\nIrigaray’s disruption of binaries for queer analyses of identity\n(Butler 1993: 36–39; Grosz 1989), and used Irigarayan concepts\nto develop queer analyses of longstanding feminist issues, such as the\nexperience of breast feeding (R. Lee 2018). \nPhenomenological methods can also track this traffic between\nContinental feminism and queer theory. For example, Sara Ahmed’s\nQueer Phenomenology (2006) explores the use of phenomenology\nin queer studies by asking, among other questions, how to understand\nthe “orientation” of sexual orientation as the way bodies\nare directed towards particular objects and away from others. In\ndeveloping this queer use of phenomenology, Ahmed acknowledges her\ndebt to feminist philosophers of the body such as Sandra Bartky, Iris\nMarion Young, Rosalyn Diprose, and Gail Weiss, as well as early\nphenomenologists such as de Beauvoir and phenomenologists of race\nincluding Linda Alcoff, Frantz Fanon, and Lewis Gordon. \nGiven these examples of the overlap of figures and approaches in\nContinental feminism and queer theory, it is worth asking what\ndistinguishes the approaches. One may be tempted to say that feminism\nfocuses more on gender (historically, within continental feminism,\nthis may be more commonly discussed as sexual difference) and queer\ntheory focuses more on sexuality (including questions of pleasure,\ndesire, and eroticism). Yet many working within Continental feminism,\nespecially as inflected with French theory, also focus on questions\nrelated to sexuality such as pleasure, desire, and eroticism. And\nthere are also reasons to be suspicious of how the gender-sexuality\nsplit is narrated as a feminist-queer split. While some have argued\nthat there are good reasons to draw distinctions between these fields\nin order to do justice to their distinct concerns (G. Rubin 2011;\nHalley 2006), there have also been many challenges to overly\nprogrammatic forms of this separation (Huffer 2013) and accounts of\nhow this narrative can overlook the field’s mutual interest in\nunderstanding the complex relationship between gender and sexuality,\nas well as the possibility of a queer feminism (Jagose 2009).\nNevertheless, despite the overlaps in figures and archives, as well as\nthe wealth of resources in queer theory on topics that Continental\nfeminist philosophers hold dear (temporality, embodiment, identity,\nand desire, to name only a few), the relatively slow uptake of texts\nmarked explicitly as queer theory has been noticeable (Winnubst 2010).\nThis is not to erase the important work done at the intersections of\nthese fields but to acknowledge that the relationship is not a\nseamless one. In their introductory comments to a “Roundtable on\nContinental Feminism”, Lynne Huffer and Shannon Winnubst (2017)\nnote the relative lack of engagement with queer theory among the\ncontributions, and they ask whether Continental feminism is capacious\nenough to embrace queer theory, a question that has also been posed to\nphilosophy more broadly (Ahmed 2016b; Salamon 2009; Winnubst\n2010). \nFinally, both Continental feminism and queer theory have also been\nextensively critiqued for the whiteness and Anglo-Eurocentric nature\nof their archives. In one particularly well-known rendition of this\ncritique, Cathy Cohen asks whether queer theory has lived up to its\nanti-identitarian promise of creating coalitions across difference\n(2005). As a way to intervene in the whiteness of queer theory\n(Johnson and Henderson 2005), Roderick Ferguson (2004) coined the\nterm “queer of color critique” to describe how various\nintersections of race, gender, sexuality, and class operate in\nnationalistic discourses of identity and belonging; it is, in\nFerguson’s words, \na heterogenous enterprise made up of women of color feminism,\nmaterialist analysis, poststructuralist theory, and queer critique.\n(Ferguson 2004: 149) \nOther notable and early contributors to this sub-field include\nJosé Muñoz, E. Patrick Johnson, Chandan Reddy, and\nGayatri Gopinath. Although the topics at work in queer of color\ncritique concerning identity, embodiment, temporality, and affect have\nalso been topics of central interests to Continental feminists, the\nuptake of queer of color critique, as with queer theory, has been slow\nin Continental feminism. However, as Continental feminism\nexpands—as shown through this entry— the resources of\nqueer theory and queer of color critique are waiting in the wings as\ncrucial, if at times under acknowledged, interlocutors. \nLike Continental feminism, queer theory and queer of color critique\ncontinue the longstanding feminist tradition of sending texts and\nideas in directions they were perhaps never intended to travel. Recent\ntrajectories at the crossroads of Continental feminism and queer\nstudies include attention to neoliberal capitalism (Winnubst 2015;\nMcWhorter 2012), sex and gender in ancient Greek metaphysics (Bianchi\n2014); critical disability theory (Puar 2017; K. Hall 2014; Yergeau\n2018; and Gallop 2019), Latina feminism and existential phenomenology\n(Ortega 2016), affect and temporality (Ahmed 2019; Amin 2017; Freeman\n2019), and materialism and concepts of agency (Chen 2012). As explored\nin the next section, another important interlocutor with both\nContinental feminism and queer theory is transgender studies. \nA number of scholars have noted the complex interplay of shared and\ndistinct concerns between trans, feminist, and queer frameworks\n(Namaste 1996 and 2009; Prosser 1998; Heyes 2003; Salamon 2010a;\nStryker 2004). Emerging in the 1990s as a distinct field of academic\ninquiry, trans studies shares many of the intellectual roots of queer\ntheory yet also departs from queer studies through its explicit focus\non trans experience, including both non-monolithic nature of that\nexperience and the importance of trans people speaking for themselves\nabout their own lives. Likewise, while many of the theoretical\nframeworks and figures at the heart of Continental feminism are\npresent in trans studies (e.g., post-structuralism, phenomenology,\nFoucauldian genealogy, materialism), there have also been important\ncritiques of how Continental feminist approaches can ignore or\nsideline trans experience. Significantly, many of the philosophers\nworking in Continental feminism and trans studies cited in this entry\ncross inter- and intra-disciplinary boundaries. \nIn exploring the relationship between Continental feminist and trans\nstudies, it is crucial to acknowledge the forms that transphobia and\ntrans-exclusionary gestures can assume in feminist discourse more\ngenerally. For an extended overview of this history, see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on trans issues.\n The entry explains points of terminology (trans, transgender, trans*,\ntranssexual), as well as the historical emergence of transgender\nstudies and the broader (i.e., non-Continental specific) relationship\nbetween feminist and trans issues. \nIn one widely recognized form of feminist transphobia (found in the\nwork of trans-exclusionary radical feminists such as Janice Raymond),\ntrans women are portrayed as not “real” women and as\nthreats to feminist movements (Bettcher 2006, 2007; McKinnon 2018).\nHowever, there is another strand of feminist theory that has a\ndistinct relationship to trans issues, and (importantly for present\npurposes) it is a lineage of feminism that draws heavily on\nContinental figures such as Butler. While there is no doubt that\nButler’s work has been foundational in trans studies as well as\nin queer theory (Gerdes 2014; Salah 2007), it is also the case that\nher work has been critiqued for its selective use of trans experience\n(Prosser 1998; Namaste 1996; H. Rubin 1998). Critics point out that\ntrans identity tends be affirmed in Butlerian queer feminist discourse\nwhen it can be used to demonstrate the actual constructedness of\ngender, or its lack of ontological necessity, but also that some trans\nidentity is portrayed as problematically essentialist when accompanied\nby claims to “really be” a man or a woman and/or demands\nfor medical transition (Valentine 2012). While Prosser and Rubin both\ncritique this rejection of claims to gender realness from a\nphenomenological perspective (and Prosser (1998) from a psychoanalytic\nframework as well), Namaste (1996) focuses on the institutional\nreality of gender that is often sidelined in these debates. In\nresponse, Jack Halberstam has argued that, while Prosser’s\nfrustration with a selective use of trans identity in queer and\nfeminist theory is understandable, there are still significant\nproblems with the normativity inherent in the idea of gendered\nrealness (2005). \nNotably, the proliferation of non-trans feminist writers working on\ntrans issues in the 1990s led to Jacob Hale’s “Suggested\nRules for Non-Transsexuals Writing about Transsexuals, Transsexuality,\nTranssexualism, or Trans” (1997\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n Significant non-trans feminist analyses, following Hale and the\nemergence of transgender studies, include work by Cressida Heyes\n(2003) and Naomi Scheman (1996, 2016), both of whom articulate\ntheoretical bases for solidarity between cis and trans feminists.\nThere are also important instances of cis feminist theorists bringing\ntrans issues directly into their own work as serious interlocutors,\nrather than as thought experiments (Ahmed 2016b; Colebrook 2015;\nShotwell & Sangrey 2008) and collaborating with trans theorists\n(Heyes & Latham 2018). The term “cis” itself has also\nreceived more scholarly attention in the last two decades (Aultman\n2014). While the original intention behind the term was to\ndenaturalize non-trans subject positions, not all scholars agree that\nthe term successfully destabilizes gender norms, particularly insofar\nas such norms are racialized (Enke 2012b). \nMore recently, there have been many new trajectories established at\nthe crossroads of Continental and trans approaches to gender. A number\nof philosophers have written at the intersections of phenomenology and\ntrans studies, particularly in critical phenomenology, which\nemphasizes questions of oppression and power in examining how things\nappear to us in the world (Weiss, Murphy, & Salamon 2020). Ephraim\nDas Janssen uses phenomenology, including the work of Martin\nHeidegger, to examine what transgender experience tells us about\ngender (2017). Megan Burke (2019) takes up Beauvoirian concepts to\nexplore androgyny, trans identity, and agender experience. Gayle\nSalamon draws on the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to develop a\nphenomenology of transphobia in The Life and Death of Latisha\nKing (2018a). Salamon merges a tradition of earlier work in\nphenomenology and trans studies (H. Rubin 1998; Prosser 1998) with\ncritical phenomenology. Tamsin Kimoto (2018) has also used both\nMerleau-Ponty and Frantz Fanon to explore hormonal transition and\ntransphobia. \nAlong similar lines, new work in psychoanalysis and trans studies is\nalso revising longstanding psychoanalytic approaches to sex and\ngender, including coercive and pathologizing theories of trans\nsubjectivity (Elliot 2014), and is using resources in psychoanalysis\nto theorize trans experiences from a less pathologizing perspective\n(Breslow 2017; Carlson 2010; Coffman 2017; Cavanagh 2010). For\nexample, Amy Ray Stewart uses Julia Kristeva’s concept of\n“intimate revolt” to illuminate trans and queer\nexperiences of psychic life (2017). Patricia Gherovici (2017) has\nwritten about trans phenomena and the need to revise psychoanalytic\nconcepts using Lacanian theory and her own clinical experience working\nwith trans people. Relying on both psychoanalytic and phenomenological\nframeworks, Salamon (2010a) has also defended Butler’s account\nof gender against the aforementioned critiques of its treatment of\ntrans experience and developed her own psychoanalytic and\nphenomenological account of a dissonance between a felt sense of\ngender and an external appearance of a body that is attuned to trans\nexperience. \nThere is also a body of work emerging that puts foundational figures\nin Continental feminism into conversation with trans studies. Marie\nDraz (2018) has placed feminist philosophical uses of Nietzsche, such\nas in the work of Butler (1990) and Rosalyn Diprose (2002), into\nconversation with trans scholarship on the institutionalization of\ngender categories, while Tim Johnston (2015) has argued that although\nscholars of gender and sexuality have used Irigarayan resources for\ndiscussing trans and queer issues, Irigaray’s own claim that\nontology is sexed and that there is an impassable limit between the\nsexes conveys an unsalvageable cissexism, or privileging of non-trans\nexperience. In a similar vein, Oli Stephano (2019) critiques Elizabeth\nGrosz’s emphasis on the irreducibility of sexual difference,\nshowing that her ontology invalidates trans embodiment and\nsubjectivities. This critique of Grosz follows earlier work by Eva\nHayward (2017) on the transphobic implications of some of\nGrosz’s feminist materialist arguments. Gayle Salamon also\ncritically examines the way that sexual difference operates as a limit\nto the reimagining of embodiment and materiality in the work of both\nIrigaray and Grosz (Salamon 2010a). María Lugones is another\nfigure of widespread use in Continental feminism who has been\nregularly cited in scholarship on trans issues (Bettcher 2014b;\nDiPietro 2019; Draz 2017a; Malatino 2019). Finally, like Butler, the\nuse of Foucault in trans studies has also changed dramatically over\nthe last several decades. For example, Foucault’s work on types\nof modern power has been used (alongside women of color feminism,\nindigenous scholarship, and numerous other sources) to examine the\nviolence caused by how state institutions administer legal gender\ncategories in sex-segregated institutions and identity documents\n(Spade 2011 [2015]). Foucauldian feminist accounts of prison and\npunishment have also been put into conversation with scholarship\nrooted in trans and gender non-conforming experience (Dilts 2017;\nVitulli 2018; Zurn 2016, 2019). \nTrans studies continues, in different veins, many of the foundational\nquestions of Continental feminism by bringing the tools of Continental\nphilosophy to bear on questions of sex, gender, and sexuality, and\nvice versa, and it continually orients these conversations in new\ndirections. Much of this work is informed by other areas of critical\ntheory (e.g., critical race theory and decolonial theory) and pushes\nthe traditional boundaries of Continental feminism. Recent scholarship\non blackness and trans history, for example, has articulated the\nimportance of developing frameworks capable of understanding the\ndimensions of racialized gender historically and today (Snorton 2017)\nand work on migration and Latinx trans people has highlighted the need\nto attend to both the limits of our political theory and the\nproductive capacities of trans people of color for generating new\nworlds (Pitts 2018). Current conversations about the relationship\nbetween Continental feminism and trans studies must also involve\nattention to the material conditions of the academy itself, as the\ngrowing attention to trans experience in philosophy more broadly has\nnot resulted in more trans voices and trans academics (Bettcher 2018\n(Other Internet Resources); Marvin 2019, 2020). Future directions in\nContinental feminism and trans studies will need to be attentive not\nonly to the intriguing philosophical questions occurring in these\nconversations, but also to the specific contours of the material\nconditions that allow trans scholarship to flourish. \nThis section explores the relationship between Continental feminism\nand Asian American feminist thought, both the tensions between the two\nas well as new directions that this relation brings to Continental\nfeminism. A major point of convergence between the two fields is the\nfocus on lived experience of Asian American women. This section begins\nby discussing the hypervisibility that Asian American women experience\ndue to the specific forms of oppression that they face, namely,\norientalization and the Model Minority myth. It then highlights the\nparadoxical form of invisibility that Asian American feminist\nphenomenologist trace in their body of work. Next, this section\nconsiders the historical position of Asian American women in\ncoalitional feminist projects, especially focusing on the ways in\nwhich Asian American women have been relegated to a\n“tag-along” group. Finally, this section will highlight\nrecent scholarship in Continental feminism that engages with Asian\nAmerican feminist theory and draws upon both Eastern and Western\ntraditions. \nIt must be noted from the outset that “Asian” is an\nexceptionally broad term, and the peoples that are considered\nAsian/Asian American have often changed throughout history. In\naccordance with anthologies by Asian American women that respond to\nthis very issue, this section addresses the identities of women who\ntrace their roots back to East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian\nsubcontinent (Asian Women United of California 1989; The Women of\nSouth Asian Descent Collective 1993). \nIn This Bridge Called My Back (Moraga & Anzaldúa\n1981 [2015]), Asian American thinkers such as Genny Lim, Merle Woo, Nellie\nWong, and Mitsuye Yamada established their positions in feminist\ntheorizing by exploring their own perspectives on topics surrounding\ngendered identity, sexuality, silencing, the feeling of not-belonging,\nand living against stereotypes of Asian American women as docile,\nquiet, agreeable, and submissive. Similarly, in This Bridge We\nCall Home (Anzaldúa & Keating 2002), Minh-ha T. Pham,\nShirley Geok-Lin Lim, and Jid Lee theorize from the specific\nexperiences that they face as Asian American immigrant women, such as\nexploring a connection to an Asian mother who emigrated to the United\nStates, navigating the cultural connection they still hold to a land\nthat they may have never visited, and living in the face of the Model\nMinority myth while also subverting the stereotype. Writings that\ncenter the perspective of the Asian American and diasporic Asian woman\nare essential for Asian American feminist theorizing, for, as Sonia\nShah emphasized, \n[a]n Asian American feminist movement is the only movement\nthat will consistently represent Asian American women’s\ninterests. (1998: xix) \nTwo early anthologies were very important for the formation of Asian\nAmerican feminism: Making Waves (Asian Women United of\nCalifornia [AWUC] 1989) and The Forbidden Stitch (Lim &\nTsutakawa 1989); they both include writings from different ethnic and\nnational backgrounds, specifically Chinese, Japanese, Filipino,\nKorean, Vietnamese, and Indian (Hill-Collins & Bilge 2016: 73). In\na recent volume entitled Asian American Feminisms and Women of\nColor Politics, editors Lynn Fujiwara and Shireen Roshanravan\npresent a series of articles emerging at the intersection of Asian\nAmerican feminist engagement with Women of Color coalition politics,\norganizing around concepts, methods, and epistemic principles central\nto Women of Color feminist scholarship (Fujiwara & Roshanravan\n2018) \nHypervisibility of Asian American women is a central issue in most\nAsian American feminist projects. Some Asian American feminist\ntheorists, such as Robin Zheng, argue that Asian American women are\nhypervisible because they are hypersexualized, orientalized, and\nexoticized. Robin Zheng (2016) discusses the complexities of\nhypervisibility “Why Yellow Fever Isn’t Flattering: A Case\nAgainst Racial Fetishes”. Zheng argues that there is little\ndifference between what is known as “yellow fever”, the\nracial fetishization and preference of Asian women and men, and what\nshe calls the “Mere Preference Argument”, which attempts\nto claim that there is nothing morally wrong with preferring certain\nracialized phenotypic traits; as she shows, despite the origin of a\nracialized fetish, both yellow fever and other racialized fetishes\n“depersonalize and otherize” their subjects (2016: 412).\nZheng shows that these fetishes are not just harmless personal\npreferences, but a set of practices and thought patterns that result\nin negative social impacts for Asian American women. Relatedly, Asian\nAmerican women are also hypervisible due to the “Model Minority\nmyth”, that is, the myth that asserts that Asian Americans are\nuniquely hard-working and thus, the ideal “model”\nminority, especially in contrast with other minority groups. This myth\nmakes Asian American women hypervisible by making them a part of a\ngroup of people who are defined by their ability to achieve upward\nclass mobility (K. Lee 2014). \nParadoxically, Asian American women are also rendered invisible in\nvarious feminist movements and discourses. Asian American feminist\ndiscussions on invisibility differ from other discussions within\nContinental feminism on visibility and feminine erasure due to their\ndual existence as both invisible subjects and hypervisible\nrepresentations of stereotypes. Poet and activist Mitsuye Yamada\nstates that Asian American women are “the visible minority that\nis invisible” (1981b). Yamada means this claim in two ways:\nfirst, in regard to how Asian American women are rendered invisible in\nconversations surrounding women of color oppressions; and second, in\nregard to how the oppressions experienced by Asian American women are\noften invisible to themselves. In order to carve out a space for\nthemselves in feminist theorizing, Asian American women in this book\nshared their stories that demonstrate the struggle of becoming visible\nto oneself while existing in a world that constantly demands\none’s invisibility. Yamada’s explains how she was\ninvisible to herself because she practiced passive resistance while\nbelieving that others did not see her as the stereotype of an Asian\nAmerican women. In order to become visible to herself and others, she\nrealized that she must act in ways, such as displaying anger in\nresponse to sexist and racist acts, that an oppressive gaze would\nclaim was “uncharacteristic” of her as an Asian American\nwoman (1981b: 40). At the same time, the Model Minority myth can also\nparadoxically render Asian American women invisible by making them\nhypervisible as successful paradigms that are perceived as lacking\nexperiences of oppression and violence and thus have no credibility to\nspeak to these lived experiences. \nAs a result of this specific form of invisibility, Asian American\nfeminists proposed new methods of political organization in order to\ninclude the voices of Asian American women in feminist coalitions. The\nsimilarities between writings that span nearly two decades gesture to\none of the many issues faced by Asian American feminism: Asian\nAmerican feminists have often been seen, and arguably still are seen,\nas a group in the background that is simply, as Yamada described,\n“tagging along” in feminist theorization against\noppressions (1981b: 40). In other words, Asian American women are\noften seen as individuals who do not often experience oppressions that\nare specific to their own identities and, therefore, have no place in\nfighting oppression. In response to this, we can see activists such as\nGrace Lee Boggs, who have worked closely with other people of color in\nthe fight against different oppressions (Boggs & Boggs 1974; 1998\n[2016]; Boggs & Kurashige 2011); Lisa Lowe’s essay on\nheterogeneity, hybridity, and multipolicy of Asian American\nwomen’s experiences (Lowe 1991); and more recent Asian American\nfeminist projects that include Asian Americans women in liberatory\nprojects in a manner that does not simply relegate them to tag-along\npositions (Shah 1998; Fujiwara & Roshanravan, 2018). \nA growing number of recent works in Asian American feminism engage\nwith figures and themes in Continental feminism through the framework\nEastern philosophy and the Asian American women’s perspective\nand as such they provide new directions for a genuinely\ntransContinental feminism. For example, building on the discussions\nconcerning gender in Continental feminisms, thinkers such as Kyoo Lee\n(2014) and Robin Wang (2016) have explored different ways that the\ngendered body has been discussed. Engaging with the concept of the\n“dark female animal” (xuapin) in\nDaodejing, Kyoo Lee explores the revolutionary potential of\nxuapin, which she claims possesses a gender-bending power.\nLee argues that xuapin demonstrates \nin a sense, superiority of femaleness and femininity –as\nthe norm, albeit invisible and inaudible \nand that it is \ngender-bending: female and not female at once, heterosexualized and\nnot at once. (K. Lee 2014: 59) \nWang investigates yin-yang gender dynamics through a variety of both\nEastern and Western sources in order to answer whether yin-yang gender\nconstruction allows for gender equality. Alluding to Continental\nfeminists who wrote on gender such as Simone de Beauvoir, Judith\nButler, and Luce Irigaray, Wang discusses an exploration of gender\nthrough a Chinese framework (the yin-yang) that does not make a clear\ndistinction between sex and gender. Wang argues that yin-yang gender\nconstruction offers a dynamic and fluid description of gender\nrelationships (Wang 2016: 224). \nThis entry has listed a number of ways in which Continental approaches\nand figures are used to address feminist issues; we have attempted\nboth to describe some of the ongoing research areas in Continental\nfeminism and to point out new directions it has been taking over the\npast decades. However, this list remains incomplete as we have been\nunable to account for all of the important work underway. A more\ncomplete entry would need to include projects on the intersection\nbetween Continental feminism and critical disability studies,\nindigenous feminisms, and new materialisms and humanisms. Furthermore,\nwe do not mean to suggest that there is no overlap or intersection\nbetween the topics or figures grouped under each section heading here.\nLastly, there is certainly ongoing work of which we are not aware that\nis already making an impact on the present and future of feminist\nscholarship. We thus conclude here not with a summative statement\ndefining Continental feminism but rather by reflecting on the material\nconditions of Continental feminism. \nWhen Linda Martín Alcoff addressed the Eastern American\nPhilosophical Association in 2012, she reflected on the tension and\nissues within disciplinary philosophy and urged philosophers to\n“apply our diagnostic impulses to ourselves” (Alcoff 2013:\n43). A necessary aspect of such praxis for Continental feminists in\nlight of the genealogies considered here is exemplified by Audre Lorde\nwho, speaking on the “Personal is Political Panel” at the\nSecond Sex Conference in 1979, stated \nI urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of\nknowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any\ndifference that lives there. See whose face it wears. (Lorde 1984a:\n101) \nLorde calls feminists to enact a humble and frank confrontation with\ntheir own embodied lives and senses of self in the context of each\nperson’s differential implication in racist, sexist,\nheterosexist, classist and ableist power. Rather than imagining that\none puts on one’s thinking hat and reflects “as a\ntheorist” and then take it off and acts “as a regular\nperson”, Continental feminisms suggest that the subject who\ntheorizes is themself always an embodied subject: Kris Sealey reminds\nus that “Continental methods oftentimes refract differently\nacross race and gender axes” and that for this reason,\nContinental feminists ought “to be intentional about the\nrelationship they occupy, quite simultaneously, to racial and gender\nliberation” (Sealey 2017: 166). As this entry has shown, the\ndiversity of Continental feminist thought has been developed through\nthe thoughtful negotiation of many different struggles. For the\nimagined community of Continental feminism to continue to grow and\nsupport these projects, space must continually be made for new\npractitioners. Since, as we put above, Continental feminism is less\nconcerned with changing a woman’s place in a symbolic or social\nsystem, and more on upending that system itself, members of this\nacademic community must continue to do the work that will make it\npossible to learn from each other. Only in this way Continental\nfeminism can be opened up fully to its interdisciplinary\npotential.","contact.mail":"jshorter@holycross.edu","contact.domain":"holycross.edu"},{"date.published":"2020-11-10","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/femapproach-continental/","author1":"Dilek Huseyinzadegan","author2":"Jana McAuliffe","entry":"femapproach-continental","body.text":"\n\n\n\n\n[Editor’s Note: The following new entry replaces the\n former entry\n on this topic by the previous author.]\n\n\n\n\nContinental feminism denotes an approach to feminist issues in\nphilosophy and the world both via figures and methods of what\nis called the “Continental” tradition in philosophy\nand via critical interventions into this tradition.\nContinental tradition in philosophy today refers to a set of\nnineteenth and twentieth century figures and theoretical traditions\nfrom mainland Europe, arising as a way for English-speaking\nphilosophers in the United States to distinguish their approach to\nphilosophical questions from that of the analytic tradition. By\nutilizing one or more of the signature schemas of the Continental\ntradition, Continental feminists contribute to problem areas ranging\nfrom metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, and social and\npolitical philosophy. Continental feminism thus refers to a body and\nstyle of work consisting of feminist interpretations of mainstream\nContinental figures (largely from what is called “Continental\nEurope”, such as Hegel, Levinas, Derrida, Foucault); feminist\nuses of psychoanalysis, phenomenology, deconstruction, genealogy, and\ncritical theory; and of interpretations of European feminists and\nfigures such as de Beauvoir, Irigaray, Arendt, and Kristeva. Note,\nhowever, that Europe is not and has never been a continent, and in\nthis sense, Continental feminism, like Continental philosophy, is more\nof an imagined community of approaches, figures, and traditions, or an\numbrella concept, rather than a precise term.\n\n\nElaine Miller points out that the term “Continental\nfeminism” came into circulation in the United States in 2007\n(Miller 2017); as she defines it, Continental feminism\n\n\n\n\ninvolves a commitment to the historicity of philosophical concepts,\nincluding the sometimes-uncomfortable contexts of their production, a\nbelief that it is through the examination of texts that the genealogy\nof ideas can be traced and resources for critically responding to them\ncan be formulated, and that the “canon” is subject to\nconstant re-interrogation and reconfiguration. (Miller 2017: 154)\n\n\n\nIn Allison Stone’s terms,\n\n\n\n\ndescribing the world as it really is—not as an aggregate of\nstatic items but as an ever-shifting web of relations—calls for\nunfamiliar, difficult language. (Stone 2015: 4)\n\n\n\nA distinguishing feature of Continental feminism, Miller and Stone\nagree, is that it\n\n\n\n\nembodies a refusal to prima facie privilege clarity and\nsuccinctness of argument over acknowledging through language the\ncomplexity, difficulty, and problematic nature of the issues being\naddressed. (Miller 2017: 154; Stone 2015: 2)\n\n\n\nAs a way of beginning to address the Euro- and U.S.-centric biases of\ncontinental philosophy, a transContinental turn in Continental\nfeminism proposed by Kyoo Lee and Alyson Cole aims to incorporate a\nglobal view of feminist issues and theories, where\n\n\n\n\n“trans” serves as a marker for the constant geo-cultural\nflows of ideas in transit, as in “transatlantic”,\n“transpacific”, “transoceanic”, etc., as well\nas for cutting-edge works, conversations, and debates in\ntrans-critical, cultural, disciplinary, human, gender, genic, lingual,\nmedial, national fields, etc., and as trans*feminist discourses. (Cole\nand Lee 2019: iv)\n\n\n\nAccordingly, this entry will take Continental feminism to include the\nfollowing distinct yet related set of issues and areas: (1) the\nfeminist use of figures, traditions, and approaches of\nphenomenology/existentialism, psychoanalysis, post-structuralism\n(deconstruction and genealogy), and critical theory; (2) critical\ninterventions into the assumptions about sex, gender, class, race,\nability, religion, and age endemic to European philosophy; and (3)\ninterpretations of hitherto underrepresented figures and methods of\nfeminism from a transContinental and transAtlantic perspective that\nestablish new, abandoned, or previously delegitimated genealogies for\nfeminist thought.\n\n\nIt is important to note that not all Continental feminists are\nphilosophers or work in Philosophy departments; thus, Continental\nfeminism is interdisciplinary and its practitioners come from various\nfields. As this subfield developed in the early 2000s, there were\nalready disciplinary, intra-disciplinary and extra-disciplinary\nprojects that explored feminist issues by utilizing phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, deconstructive, and critical theoretical approaches.\nRather than organizing this entry around the signature schemas of the\nContinental tradition and subsuming ongoing work that uses these\napproaches under them, this entry will locate crucial genealogies for\nContinental feminism in the work of Black feminists, post- and\ndecolonial feminists, women of color feminists, Asian American\nfeminists, trans feminists, and queer feminists. We take these\ngenealogies as central to the past, present, and future of Continental\nfeminism, and accordingly this entry is organized topically, in order\nto outline the ways that Continental feminisms have developed in\nconversation and in tension with these interdisciplinary projects.\nThese projects have been unearthing the cissexist,\nsexist/misogynistic, racist, heterosexist, classist, ageist, ableist,\ncolonial commitments of philosophy as a discipline and a professional\nfield as they are simultaneously expanding, transforming, and pushing\nthe concerns and methods of Continental thought in interdisciplinary\niterations. Indeed, what distinguishes Continental feminism clearly\nfrom Analytic feminism are its call for interdisciplinarity and its\nbelief that feminist omissions themselves can become sites from which\nnew projects are launched, as will be highlighted throughout this\nentry. As such, Continental feminism starts with the premise that\nEuropean or Anglo-American norms and categories of thought can be\ninterpreted, critiqued, and re-envisioned or abandoned for feminist\npurposes.\n\nContinental feminists share with other Continental thinkers an\ninterest in close reading that uses careful exegesis to unpack the\ndeep meanings of texts through attention to their linguistic and\nhistorical specificity. However, to utilize a philosophical tradition\nthat has largely presumed rather than explored the impacts of sex and\ngender on material life, continental feminists often read irreverently\nto focus on concerns that traditional philosophy might push to the\nside. While all feminist theorizing deals with questions of power,\nsubjectivity, and culture, Continental feminist approaches to these\nissues are often critical in the sense that they explore how\nexternal power dynamics affect the constitution of inner experiences,\nand in turn how embodied and subjective re-articulations of power can\nand should transform the world in the pursuit of justice. This\nfrequently involves taking lived experience as a crucial component of\ncritical philosophy; as Gail Weiss puts it, \nonly by interrogating the “ordinary” dimensions of\nexperience is it possible to arrive at an understanding of the dynamic\nforces that give meaning to individual lives and that are both the\nobstacle and the vehicle to achieving lasting social change. (Weiss\n2008: 5) \nTo present a broad sketch of characteristics of continental feminism\nthroughout its history, this section focuses on methods that\nContinental feminists use to engage embodied experience in their\nprojects. The gendered critique of the traditional Western\nphilosophical tendency to dichotomize the body that feels and the mind\nthat thinks is an ongoing theme in continental feminism (see entry on\n feminist perspectives on the body).\n The account presented here is not at all complete, as the specific\naims and methods of such feminist projects differ widely, most\nimportantly in terms of how an analysis of sex and gender is impacted\nby other aspects of embodied experience such as race, sexuality, and\nability. This section first addresses some ways that continental\nfeminists trouble a mind-body distinction by engaging affect and\nemotion in their work. Next, it explores two examples of how\ncontinental traditions, psychoanalysis and phenomenology, are made\ninto critical resources in Continental feminist projects. Finally, it\npresents work that engages an ongoing critique of culture and everyday\nexperience as an important aspect of feminist theorizing. \nMany Continental feminists focus on the overlaying of mental and\nphysical experience via the concepts of affect, emotion, and feeling.\nAffect is described by Teresa Brennan as “the physiological\nshift accompanying a judgment” (Brennan 2004: 5). The\n“transmission of affect” describes the way that one can\ncatch the mood of another; this experience is “social in origin\nbut biological and physical in effect” (Brennan 2004: 3).\nBrennan describes transmission as when the “emotions or\naffects of one person, and the enhancing or depressing energies these\naffects entail” pass from one person to another (Brennan 2004:\n3). Affect is thus one way to describe how social experience impacts\nthe corporeal life of subjects through the transference of energy. In\nBrennan’s case, affective states are directional; they\nare not neutral but push or press on subjects. At the same time, terms\nlike affect and feeling might be distinguished based on the extent to\nwhich one considers affect to be already coded with or influenced by\nsocial significance for a subject (see Ahmed 2010: 230–231,\nSeigworth & Gregg 2010, esp. 5–8). \nContinental feminist projects on emotion often analyze historically\ncontextualized experiences. Ann Cvetkovich engages with trauma in a\nway that \nfocuses on the everyday and the insidious…and situates it in a\nsocial and cultural frame rather than a medical one. (Cvetkovich 2007:\n464) \nShe then presents a political account of depression that\ndepathologizes such negatively-connotated emotional experiences so\nthat they can become more visible in public and thus create a\npotential foundation for community (Cvetkovich 2007: 460). In The\nCultural Politics of Emotion, Sara Ahmed argues that emotion is\ngenerated when meaning is produced across social-political\ninteraction; these feelings create the boundaries of affinity groups\nand impact self-understanding. In this analysis, emotions help\nconstitute what a person understands as their objective condition, and\nthus \nemotions are not “in” either the individual or the social,\nbut produce the very surfaces and boundaries that allow all kinds of\nobjects to be delineated. (Ahmed 2004 [2014: 10]) \nBecause feeling is often ambivalent and multi-faceted, rather than in\nspite of this complexity, social critics who attend to how affects are\nemployed and manipulated in both textual and social-political\nargumentation can produce readings that trouble an easy dichotomy\nbetween what is a “good” and what a “bad”\nexperience. \nPsychoanalytically-informed projects use concepts such as trauma,\nmourning, melancholia, and abjection to analyze embodied experience\n(Irigaray 1974 [1985]; Spillers 1996; Butler 1997; Felman 2002; Oliver\n2004; entry on\n psychoanalytic feminism).\n They frequently engage aesthetics as an aspect of social critique\n(Chanter 2008; Kristeva 1980 [1982]; Miller 2014). This allows a\nsymptomatic reading of feeling to be interpreted back against the\nsocial order, as is seen in Judith Butler’s Frames of\nWar. In this text, Butler analyzes what makes a life grievable\nand argues that the questions of who appears as a human, whose life\nshould be protected, and who does not are all figured in advance of\nany particular political decision through a pre-reflexive manipulation\nof affect (Butler 2009 [2016: 64]). Supplementing democratic theory\nwith Continental feminist interpretations, Noëlle McAfee deploys\nKristeva and the resources in her thought, as well as psychoanalysis,\nspecifically on the issues of affect and the notion of the\n“political unconscious” (McAfee 2000 and 2008). \nCritical phenomenologists draw on the methods of phenomenology to\ndemonstrate “the multiple ways in which power moves through our\nbodies and our lives” (Introduction, Weiss, Murphy, &\nSalamon 2020: xiv). Lisa Guenther understands critical phenomenology\nas both a way of doing philosophy and a way of approaching political\nactivism (Guenther 2020: 15). Most characteristically, Guenther argues\nthat critical phenomenology employs reworked versions of \nMerleau-Ponty’s concept of the body schema to account for\ngendered and sexual schemas (Simone de Beauvoir, Iris Marion Young,\nTalia Mae Bettcher, Gayle Salamon), racialized schemas (Frantz Fanon,\nLewis Gordon, Sara Ahmed, George Yancy, Alia Al-Saji), disability\nschemas (Kay Toombs, Lisa Diedrich, Havi Carel), and other aspects of\nlived experience. (Guenther 2020: 13–14) \nA recent volume edited by Gail Weiss, Ann V, Murphy, and Gayle\nSalamon, entitled 50 Concepts for a Critical* Phenomenology\n(2020), shows that many of the central concepts of critical\nphenomenology intersect with Continental feminism. \nFinally, considering the social and political import of inner states\nand the centering of quotidian experiences of power enable Continental\nfeminists to explore culture as it develops. For instance, Shannon\nSullivan’s Good White People: The Problem with Middle-Class\nAnti-Racism focuses on “the personal side of whiteness and\nwhite privilege” with attention to the embodied experience of\nrace (S. Sullivan 2014: 19) to critique the ways through which white\nliberals set themselves up as altruistic, “good” white\npeople through, e.g., hypocritical modes of tolerance that maintain\nwhite domination (S. Sullivan 2014: 4). Robin James’\nResilience & Melancholy explores pop music as a way to\nanalyze the impact of neoliberal biopolitics; she combines music\ntheory with psychoanalytic and Foucauldian philosophies to critique\ncomplicity with multi-racial white supremacist patriarchy and argues\nthat music, e.g., Rihanna’s, offer strategies for countering\nthis oppressive power (R. James 2015). In Irony in the Age of\nEmpire: Comic Perspectives on Philosophy and Freedom, Cynthia\nWillett engages film and stand-up comedy to articulate a libidinal\nunderstanding of freedom that can counter the liberal paradigms of\nindividuality with a sense of freedom defined “in terms of\nequality and solidarity” (Willett 2008: 14). Erin Tarver\nanalyzes practices of sports fans, with particular attention to\nfootball, baseball, and basketball fans in the American South, to\nbetter understand how individual and group identities are maintained\nto “…shore up, reproduce, and very occasionally, subvert\nracial, sexual and gender hierarchies” (Tarver 2017: 3). This\nwork is often interdisciplinary, and some of these projects work at\nthe intersection between continental and pragmatist feminisms (see\nentry on\n intersections between pragmatist and continental feminism). \nSimultaneously reading carefully and irreverently, continental\nfeminists deepen the philosophical account of experience by\nintegrating historically contextualized feeling into their projects,\nusing and transmuting philosophical traditions and traditional\nfigures, and interrogating everyday experiences in their embodied and\ncultural specificity. This work insists that meaning and social order\nfunction through unrecognized cooptation, subordination or exclusion\nin various intersectional constellations. In general, continental\nfeminisms are less concerned with changing a woman’s place in a\nsymbolic or social system, and more focused on upending such systems,\nas will be explored in more detail in the following sections. \nThis section on the convergences between Black and Continental\nfeminist thought begins with a discussion about the history of Black\nfeminist scholarship utilizing existential/phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, critical, and hermeneutic approaches. It then\nintroduces intersectionality as the major heuristic for Black feminist\ntheorizing, and concludes by highlighting emerging areas and\nintersections between Black studies and Black feminist Continental\nthought. \nBlack women have long been contributors to the Continental\nphilosophical tradition. One may argue that their contributions to\nprofessional philosophy started after the graduation of the first\nBlack woman to earn the PhD in philosophy, Joyce Mitchell Cook, who\ncompleted the degree in 1965 from Princeton University. Even prior to\nthis date, however, Black women engaged in projects that we can\nrecognize as Continental feminist projects. Importantly, \nmany Black intellectuals in the United States going back (at least) to\nthe nineteenth century offered what are now described as existential,\nphenomenological, and/or genealogical analyses of race and racism.\n(Belle 2012, 329 fn. 1) \nThese contributions did not always occur in the form of traditional\nphilosophical discussions, nor are they always created by those who\nhave professional degrees in philosophy, which is certainly true of\nthe nineteenth and early twentieth century thinkers, Sojourner Truth,\nMaria W. Stewart, and\n Anna Julia Cooper. \nBlack feminists’ contributions to Continental philosophy\ndemonstrate the ways in which their voices are crucial to both shaping\nand expanding the discipline. Kathryn Sophia Belle, Donna-Dale\nMarcano, and Maria del Guadalupe Davidson edited Convergences:\nBlack Feminism and Continental Philosophy (del Guadalupe et al.\n2010), the only text at the publication of this entry that addresses\nboth these topics simultaneously. For the editors, the concept of\nconvergence is demonstrated by the natural, historical, and necessary\nengagement of Black women with Continental philosophy. Belle\nwrites, \nBlack feminist and womanist thinkers inevitably address the very same\nissues of agency, identity, alienation, power, and so on that are\nraised in much recent Continental philosophy. Likewise, from Immanuel\nKant to the feminist thinkers of the present, Continental philosophy\nhas engaged, to some extent, with issues of race and gender. (2010:\n5) \nThe Black feminist tradition in Continental philosophy demonstrates\nthat Black women are not strangers nor enemies of Continental\nphilosophy; rather, their unique theoretical positioning affords them\nthe opportunity to utilize, challenge, and expand the tradition. \nBlack feminist thinkers contribute to Continental feminist thought in\nat least two ways. First, they engage directly with Continental\nfigures and theories. For example, Lorraine Hansberry comments that\nSimone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex (1949, translated\nin 1953) was arguably the “most important work of this\ncentury” (1957 [1995: 129 and 133]), and Antillean thinker\nPaulette Nardal draws on both features of the Harlem Renaissance and\nexistentialist thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre to provide a\nphenomenological and genealogical account of how the Black race, and\nAntilleans in particular, have come to understand their own notion of\nrace consciousness in “The Awakening of Race\nConsciousness” (1932). More recently, they engage with canonical\nfigures and ideologies of Continental philosophy, as in the work of\nKathryn Sophia Belle on Hannah Arendt (2014) or Kris Sealey on\nEmmanuel Levinas (2014). Second, regardless of their professional\nPhilosophy degrees or lack thereof, Black feminist thinkers utilize\nthe tools of the Continental tradition as part of their\ninterdisciplinary approaches, as in the use of Foucault in the work of\nSylvia Wynter (2003) and the use of Freud, Lacan, and psychoanalysis\nin the work of Hortense Spillers (1996). \nBlack feminist thinkers have frequently used intersectionality as an\neffective entry-point into conversations with the Continental\ntradition. Intersectionality is a Black feminist theory that describes\nthe oppression that Black women experience as a result of lying at the\nnexus of simultaneously impactful identities, such as that of race,\ngender, class, and sexuality. As such, intersectionality can be used\nas a phenomenological tool to describe Black women’s lived\nexperience of oppression. While legal theorist Kimberlé\nCrenshaw coined the term in 1989, the theory has been articulated at\nleast since the mid-nineteenth century in Sojourner Truth’s\nproclamation, “Ain’t I a Woman?” (1851). In the\nspeech, Truth highlights that Black women are treated with less\nrespect than white women while bearing the same burdens of racism as\nBlack men. Anna Julia Cooper wrote that Black women are \nconfronted by a both a woman question and a race problem and is as yet\nan unknown or an unacknowledged factor in both. (1892 [1988: 134]) \nIn their collective statement from April 1977, The Combahee River\nCollective argues that \nBlack feminism [is] the logical political movement to combat the\nmanifold and simultaneous oppressions that all women of color face \nand that \n[t]here is also undeniably a personal genesis for Black feminism, that\nis, the political realization that comes from the seemingly personal\nexperiences of individual Black women’s lives. (Taylor 2017: 15\nand 17) \nIntersectionality is thus a hallmark of Black feminist thought because\nit prioritizes the lived experiences of Black women. In doing so, it\nsupplies the tools to think about the extent to which one’s\nconsciousness the world is informed by experiences of racism, sexism,\nclassism, and homophobia. \nIn addition to its utility in explaining Black women’s lived\nexperience, intersectionality also provides tools for Black feminists\nto critique the presumed whiteness and bourgeois-class status of\nfeminism and to combat various forms of oppression and violence. Thus,\nintersectionality is also key to critiquing phenomenological analysis,\nthat is, analysis of lived experiences and feminist movements through\nthe lens of sociopolitical identities such as race, sex, and class.\nAngela Davis’s text Women, Race, & Class (1981) is\nan early model of this approach; it details the history of U.S.\nwomen’s movements and their consideration, or lack thereof, of\nthe class-based and racial dimensions of womanhood. Texts such as\nPatricia Hill-Collins’s Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge,\nConsciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment (1990 [2015]) underscore\nthe ways in which Black women create their own epistemological\nstandpoint as a result of their lived experiences. In the 1970s to\n90s, when Black women’s contributions to academia reached its\nzenith, Black feminist scholars such as Barbara Christian in\n“The Race for Theory” (1988), Toni Morrison in Playing\nin the Dark (1992), and Audre Lorde in “The Master’s\nTools will Never Dismantle the Master’s House” (1984a) and\n“Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference”\n(1984b) exemplified Black women’s critiques of theoretical\napproaches that adopt a “neutral” stance toward feminist\nmovements where neutral meant presuming all women to be white,\nmiddle-class, young or middle-aged, and heterosexual (see also Hull,\nBell-Scott, & Smith 1982). \nCurrent Black feminist work centers Black epistemologies,\npractices, and concepts. The burgeoning scholarship of Black women\nphilosophers continue to push the boundaries of Continental feminism,\nas in the work of Lindsey Stewart’s work on Black feminist\npractices of freedom (2017), Camisha Russell’s work on the\nissues of race and gender in assisted reproduction (2018), and Axelle\nKarera’s work, which focuses on the Anthropocene and\nantiBlackness (2019). In addition to engaging with the canonical\nfigures of the Continental tradition, Black thinkers harvest\nphilosophy from their own perspective and experience of the world as\nwell as their theoretical archives. Much of this more recent work\nintersects with Black Studies. The work of Black thinkers from\ndisciplines other than philosophy are intersecting with Continental\nphilosophical and feminist approaches, as seen in the works of such as\nSaidiya Hartman (1997, 2007, and 2019), Christina Sharpe (2016),\nRizvana Bradley (2014 and 2018), Jennifer Nash (2019), Denise Ferreira\nda Silva (2007, 2014, and 2018), Riley Snorton (2017), Selamawit\nTerrefe (2020), and Zakiyyah Iman Jackson (2020). \nContinental feminist approaches to questions on colonialism revolve\naround two main sets of investigations: on the one hand, the\ninterrogation of the hegemony of the West as an abstract category that\nis deployed strategically to exclude and inferiorize communities\ndeemed Non-Western (Spivak 1999; Narayan 1997; Mohanty 1984), and on\nthe other hand, the question of coloniality, which focuses on the\npolitical and epistemic ordering of the globe starting with the\ncolonization of the Americas (Lugones 2003; Wynter 1995; Ortega 2016).\nTo this end, these approaches both use schemas of the Continental\ntradition (such as phenomenology, psychoanalysis, genealogy,\ndeconstruction, and poststructuralism) and call into question the\ngeographic and racial assumptions that underlie Continental\nphilosophy. For both of these approaches, an analysis of colonialism\nis inseparable from the political aim of challenging and undoing the\ncolonial world. This challenge entails deconstructing the categories\nof the colonially determined globe (such as East-West,\nWestern-Non-Western, Developed-Underdeveloped, First World-Third\nWorld, North-South) through focusing on the concrete lived experiences\nof individuals and communities. This section focuses on the general\ncharacteristics of these two Continental feminist approaches taken up\nunder the rough categories of postcolonial and decolonial feminisms,\nwith the former focusing on the Western-Non-western divide that marks\ncolonial relations, and the latter on the North-South dialogues that\nemerge within the relations of coloniality. It concludes by\nhighlighting coalitional thinking, a fundamental aspect of both post-\nand decolonial feminist approaches. \nPostcolonial feminist approaches maintain that in order to interrogate\nthe hegemony of the West, it is necessary to deconstruct the ways in\nwhich it is deployed to exclude the non-Western subject. Furthermore,\nsuch deployment is always a strategic one, insofar as the\n“West” is not a concrete geographical category, and the\nparadigm of Western subjectivity is continuously built by demarcating\nthose who do not fit in it. Postcolonial feminisms are\ninterdisciplinary and not limited to the field of philosophy, and they\nchallenge the inscription of the gender, racial, and geographic\ncategories that underlie the hegemony of the Western subject. In doing\nso, Continental feminist approaches engage with figures from\npoststructuralism and critical theory (such as Foucault, Derrida,\nDeleuze and Adorno), and they deploy methods such as genealogy and\ndeconstruction (Spivak 1988; Mohanty 1984), in order to question the\nunderlying geographic and gendered assumptions of these methods. In\n“Can the Subaltern Speak?” for example, Gayatri\nChakravorty Spivak engages with French poststructuralism and questions\nthe paradigms of speech/reason that deny the very possibility of\ncapacities such as resistance for those that do not fit within the\ngeographic, racialized, and gendered boundaries of Western\nSubjectivity (Spivak 1988). In doing so, she highlights the ways in\nwhich poststructuralism relies upon the very categories (of speech,\nreason, or universal subjectivity) that it ostensibly critiques. \nThe tension highlighted by Spivak, in which the Western Subject\nconstitutes both the dominant subject and the only subject capable of\nresistance, underlies postcolonial feminisms’ critique of the\nalignment of the West with modernity and progress (McClintock 1995;\nStoler 1995). Chandra Talpade Mohanty, in “Under Western\nEyes”, criticizes the hegemony of Western approaches in defining\nthe scope and goals of feminist struggles. Issues such as the veil\ndebate, in this sense, point to the political and phenomenological\nracialization of the Non-Western woman (Al-Saji 2010; Sheth 2006). At\nthe same time, Uma Narayan draws attention to the risks of fetishizing\nthe category of the Non-Western and highlights how such a\nfetishization remains within colonially determined divisions (Narayan\n1997; Narayan & Harding 2000). Namita Goswami, in Subjects\nThat Matter, develops heterogeneity as a kind of conceptual\ncontinuity between feminism, philosophy, and postcolonial studies,\nwhich allows for an understanding of difference beyond oppositional\nand antagonistic terms (Goswami 2019). \nDecolonial feminisms emerge primarily from the U.S. Latina and Latinx\ncontexts and have a different genealogy, insofar as they are in\ndialogue with Latin American Philosophy, Continental Philosophy,\nAnglo-American Thought, and especially U.S. Women of Color feminisms.\nFocusing on North-South dialogues, Latin American and Latina Feminist\nphilosophers such as Ofelia Schutte engage with the work of figures\nsuch as Nietzsche, Kristeva, and Irigaray while developing Latin\nAmerican philosophy as a field in U.S. academic philosophy (Schutte\n1984; 1993; for more, see the entry on\n Latin American feminism).\n Linda Martín Alcoff, for example, brings Latin American\nPhilosophy (particularly the work of Enrique Dussel) in dialogue with\nexistentialism and poststructuralism in order to develop the framework\nfor Latinx feminisms (Alcoff 2006, 2015). \nOne of the major frameworks of decolonial feminisms is “the\ncoloniality of power”, a term first introduced by Aníbal\nQuijano, and defined as “the social classification of the\nworld’s population around the idea of race” (Quijano 2000:\n1). In this sense, the colonization of the Americas is not only a\nhistorical moment, but also the emergence of race and the subsequent\nreorganization of the globe in accordance with what Walter Mignolo\ncalls “the colonial difference”, denoting the abstract\npositioning of Europe as the global hegemonic power (Mignolo 2002).\nDecolonial feminisms take an intersectional approach to the\ncoloniality of power and investigate, as María Lugones says,\n“the emergence of hegemonic gender arrangements along\n‘racial’ lines” starting with the colonization of\nthe Americas (Lugones 2007: 190). Decolonial feminists such as Lugones\nand Wynter bring poststructuralist critique in dialogue with Latin\nAmerican philosophy and argue that dominant gender arrangements\nthemselves are colonial; these arrangements, such as patriarchy,\nheterosexualism, or gender dimorphism mark concrete historical\nprocesses of the racial inscription of gender norms, starting from and\nwith the coloniality of power (Lugones 2008; Oyěwùmí\n2007; Wynter 2006). \nDecolonial feminisms’ emphasis on historical critique is\ninseparable from a concern with the concrete lived experiences of\nwomen of color (Moraga and Anzaldúa 1981 [2015]; Pérez\n1999; Lugones 2007, Sandoval 2000). Gloria Anzaldúa, in\nBorderlands/La Frontera, emphasizes bordered thinking as the\nunderlying logic of contemporary systems of oppression, and she\nformulates the resistances of hybrid identities that emerge both out\nof and in response to such bordered thinking (Anzaldúa 1987).\nMariana Ortega develops Latina feminist phenomenology in emphasizing\nboth the lived experience of borderlands and exile, and the\npossibilities of resistance by developing “home-tactics”\nin and through these experiences (Ortega 2016). \nCoalitional thinking is a fundamental aspect of both post- and\ndecolonial feminist approaches. Mohanty calls for coalitions across\nborders in thinking through the concrete lived experiences and\nemphasizes the importance of situated and local struggles in\nunderstanding hegemonic power relations.  Moraga and Anzaldúa,\nin their coedited collection This Bridge Called My Back, call\nfor concrete and sustained coalitions that are based on an\nintersectional understanding of women’s lives, rather than\nabstract calls for sisterhood. Decolonial feminists such as Lugones,\nChela Sandoval, Ortega, and Emma Pérez, maintain that\ncoalitional thinking cannot be an afterthought for any anti- or\ndecolonial struggles (Pérez 1999; Sandoval 2000). \nAs Continental feminism expands, it involves further conversations\nwith and in-between these approaches. The questions around the\n“continent” of Continental feminism, as well as how such a\ncontinent is situated within the colonial geographic boundaries of the\nWest and the Global North, continue to be challenged. As spaces for\nsuch a flow of ideas open up, further conversations on the possibility\nof coalition, as well as on challenging the limits of colonial thought\ncontinue to reshape the face of Continental feminism. \nThe relationship between Continental feminism and queer theory is\nsimultaneously productive and fraught. While far from exhaustive, this\nentry will first highlight some of the overlapping figures and\napproaches between the two fields, including examples of scholarship\nat their intersections. It will then briefly introduce one account of\nthe tension between them. Finally, it will close with some reflections\non the shared problems across these fields, including their\nhistorically white and Anglo-Eurocentric approaches, as well as how\nrecent work in queer of color critique aligns with and points to new\ndirections in Continental feminism. \nIn the late 1980s and the early 1990s, “queer” emerged as\na reclamation of a homophobic slur and a rallying cry for a coalition\nof the marginalized against the tyranny of the normal (Barker &\nScheele 2016; D. Hall & Jagose 2012; Warner 1993; Sedgwick 1993;\nAnzaldúa 1991 [2009]). Formed in the crucible of the AIDS\ncrisis, which sharpened the need to understand the violence\nexperienced by people excluded by norms related to gender and\nsexuality, “queer” was meant to bring attention to the\nrange of sexual/gender practices deemed outside the purview of the\nnormal. In one genealogy of queer theory, the field develops this\nearly activist reclamation of the term queer into a wide-reaching\ncritique of how norms operate in and through dominant\nconceptualizations of identity. Given this motivating impulse of\ndeconstruction, or of denaturalizing categories such as sexuality, it\nis perhaps of no surprise that queer theory has historically been a\nfield well-populated with figures (e.g., Lacan, Foucault, Derrida) and\nmethodological approaches (poststructuralism, psychoanalysis,\nphenomenology) that have been associated with Continental philosophy,\nespecially twentieth century European philosophy. \nQueer theory frequently draws on, critiques, and expands the ideas of\nmany figures and approaches that are seen as early progenitors of\nContinental feminism (e.g., Beauvoir, Irigaray, Kristeva, feminist\nphenomenology, feminist poststructuralism, critical theory,\npsychoanalytic theory). As Jagose (2009) points out, however, the\ncritique of normative identity categories was not invented by queer\ntheory, given that feminist scholarship has a rich history of\nradically disrupting the category of women along lines of race and\nsexuality. Moreover, the lines between feminism and queer theory are\nhistorically blurred. For example, Judith Butler—who is often\ncited as an originator of queer theory—explicitly marks her\nearly work as occurring in the intersection of these fields (as well\nas a number of other critical discourses) (1997). In Gender\nTrouble (1990) and Bodies that Matter (1993), Butler\ndraws on Continental feminist figures such as Irigaray, Beauvoir, and\nKristeva, and methods ranging from psychoanalysis to poststructuralism\nand phenomenology to develop a simultaneously queer and feminist\ntheoretical lens focused on understanding the relationship between\ngender and sexuality, as well as the operation of norms and identity\ncategories more broadly (Salih 2002). \nA second major figure in the relationship between Continental feminism\nand queer theory is Michel Foucault, who has been extensively used in\nboth queer and Continental (and specifically poststructuralist)\nfeminist theory, but who (as opposed to Butler) did not explicitly use\nthe terms queer and feminist. While a larger account of the connection\nbetween Foucault and queer theory is beyond the scope of this entry,\nthe relationship is a rich one. In the late 1980s, Foucault’s\nThe History of Sexuality, Volume One was read\nheavily by activists and scholars questioning dominant narratives\naround sexuality and identity (Halperin 1995); Foucault’s work\nwas also influential not only for Judith Butler’s Gender\nTrouble (1990) but also for another text often cited as\nfoundational for queer theory, Eve Sedgwick’s Epistemology\nof the Closet (1990 [2008]). \nFoucault’s genealogical approach to identity, including his\nexploration of the histories and models of power at work in modern\nconceptions of sexuality, has been important for a number of\ncontemporary scholars working at the intersections of feminism and\nqueer theory (Huffer 2010 and 2020; Russell 2010; Sawicki 2005;\nSchotten 2018; Winnubst 2006). For example, Ladelle McWhorter (1999)\ntakes up Foucault’s account of ethics as a practice of the self,\nor how we work on ourselves to become particular kinds of people,\nthrough a queer framework that resists expected developmental\ntrajectories and normative timelines of a life (e.g., heterosexual\ncoupling resulting in marriage and children). And in a different vein,\nJasbir Puar (2007) has drawn on Foucault’s theories of power (as\nwell as a wide range of interdisciplinary theory including\npostcolonial feminist theory) to analyze the relationship between\ncontemporary biopower and homonationalism, or how certain\n“good” gay and lesbian subjects, by aligning themselves\nwith U.S. imperialism, are welcomed into the nation-state. \nFigures associated with Continental feminism who do not necessarily\nmark themselves or their work as queer have also been used in queer\ntheoretical projects, just as feminists have historically done with\nany number of non-feminist philosophers. For example, queer studies\nscholars have explored the relative absence of Irigaray in queer\ntheory, argued for the queer resources of her thinking (Huffer 2013;\nWinnubst 2006), called attention to the potential use of\nIrigaray’s disruption of binaries for queer analyses of identity\n(Butler 1993: 36–39; Grosz 1989), and used Irigarayan concepts\nto develop queer analyses of longstanding feminist issues, such as the\nexperience of breast feeding (R. Lee 2018). \nPhenomenological methods can also track this traffic between\nContinental feminism and queer theory. For example, Sara Ahmed’s\nQueer Phenomenology (2006) explores the use of phenomenology\nin queer studies by asking, among other questions, how to understand\nthe “orientation” of sexual orientation as the way bodies\nare directed towards particular objects and away from others. In\ndeveloping this queer use of phenomenology, Ahmed acknowledges her\ndebt to feminist philosophers of the body such as Sandra Bartky, Iris\nMarion Young, Rosalyn Diprose, and Gail Weiss, as well as early\nphenomenologists such as de Beauvoir and phenomenologists of race\nincluding Linda Alcoff, Frantz Fanon, and Lewis Gordon. \nGiven these examples of the overlap of figures and approaches in\nContinental feminism and queer theory, it is worth asking what\ndistinguishes the approaches. One may be tempted to say that feminism\nfocuses more on gender (historically, within continental feminism,\nthis may be more commonly discussed as sexual difference) and queer\ntheory focuses more on sexuality (including questions of pleasure,\ndesire, and eroticism). Yet many working within Continental feminism,\nespecially as inflected with French theory, also focus on questions\nrelated to sexuality such as pleasure, desire, and eroticism. And\nthere are also reasons to be suspicious of how the gender-sexuality\nsplit is narrated as a feminist-queer split. While some have argued\nthat there are good reasons to draw distinctions between these fields\nin order to do justice to their distinct concerns (G. Rubin 2011;\nHalley 2006), there have also been many challenges to overly\nprogrammatic forms of this separation (Huffer 2013) and accounts of\nhow this narrative can overlook the field’s mutual interest in\nunderstanding the complex relationship between gender and sexuality,\nas well as the possibility of a queer feminism (Jagose 2009).\nNevertheless, despite the overlaps in figures and archives, as well as\nthe wealth of resources in queer theory on topics that Continental\nfeminist philosophers hold dear (temporality, embodiment, identity,\nand desire, to name only a few), the relatively slow uptake of texts\nmarked explicitly as queer theory has been noticeable (Winnubst 2010).\nThis is not to erase the important work done at the intersections of\nthese fields but to acknowledge that the relationship is not a\nseamless one. In their introductory comments to a “Roundtable on\nContinental Feminism”, Lynne Huffer and Shannon Winnubst (2017)\nnote the relative lack of engagement with queer theory among the\ncontributions, and they ask whether Continental feminism is capacious\nenough to embrace queer theory, a question that has also been posed to\nphilosophy more broadly (Ahmed 2016b; Salamon 2009; Winnubst\n2010). \nFinally, both Continental feminism and queer theory have also been\nextensively critiqued for the whiteness and Anglo-Eurocentric nature\nof their archives. In one particularly well-known rendition of this\ncritique, Cathy Cohen asks whether queer theory has lived up to its\nanti-identitarian promise of creating coalitions across difference\n(2005). As a way to intervene in the whiteness of queer theory\n(Johnson and Henderson 2005), Roderick Ferguson (2004) coined the\nterm “queer of color critique” to describe how various\nintersections of race, gender, sexuality, and class operate in\nnationalistic discourses of identity and belonging; it is, in\nFerguson’s words, \na heterogenous enterprise made up of women of color feminism,\nmaterialist analysis, poststructuralist theory, and queer critique.\n(Ferguson 2004: 149) \nOther notable and early contributors to this sub-field include\nJosé Muñoz, E. Patrick Johnson, Chandan Reddy, and\nGayatri Gopinath. Although the topics at work in queer of color\ncritique concerning identity, embodiment, temporality, and affect have\nalso been topics of central interests to Continental feminists, the\nuptake of queer of color critique, as with queer theory, has been slow\nin Continental feminism. However, as Continental feminism\nexpands—as shown through this entry— the resources of\nqueer theory and queer of color critique are waiting in the wings as\ncrucial, if at times under acknowledged, interlocutors. \nLike Continental feminism, queer theory and queer of color critique\ncontinue the longstanding feminist tradition of sending texts and\nideas in directions they were perhaps never intended to travel. Recent\ntrajectories at the crossroads of Continental feminism and queer\nstudies include attention to neoliberal capitalism (Winnubst 2015;\nMcWhorter 2012), sex and gender in ancient Greek metaphysics (Bianchi\n2014); critical disability theory (Puar 2017; K. Hall 2014; Yergeau\n2018; and Gallop 2019), Latina feminism and existential phenomenology\n(Ortega 2016), affect and temporality (Ahmed 2019; Amin 2017; Freeman\n2019), and materialism and concepts of agency (Chen 2012). As explored\nin the next section, another important interlocutor with both\nContinental feminism and queer theory is transgender studies. \nA number of scholars have noted the complex interplay of shared and\ndistinct concerns between trans, feminist, and queer frameworks\n(Namaste 1996 and 2009; Prosser 1998; Heyes 2003; Salamon 2010a;\nStryker 2004). Emerging in the 1990s as a distinct field of academic\ninquiry, trans studies shares many of the intellectual roots of queer\ntheory yet also departs from queer studies through its explicit focus\non trans experience, including both non-monolithic nature of that\nexperience and the importance of trans people speaking for themselves\nabout their own lives. Likewise, while many of the theoretical\nframeworks and figures at the heart of Continental feminism are\npresent in trans studies (e.g., post-structuralism, phenomenology,\nFoucauldian genealogy, materialism), there have also been important\ncritiques of how Continental feminist approaches can ignore or\nsideline trans experience. Significantly, many of the philosophers\nworking in Continental feminism and trans studies cited in this entry\ncross inter- and intra-disciplinary boundaries. \nIn exploring the relationship between Continental feminist and trans\nstudies, it is crucial to acknowledge the forms that transphobia and\ntrans-exclusionary gestures can assume in feminist discourse more\ngenerally. For an extended overview of this history, see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on trans issues.\n The entry explains points of terminology (trans, transgender, trans*,\ntranssexual), as well as the historical emergence of transgender\nstudies and the broader (i.e., non-Continental specific) relationship\nbetween feminist and trans issues. \nIn one widely recognized form of feminist transphobia (found in the\nwork of trans-exclusionary radical feminists such as Janice Raymond),\ntrans women are portrayed as not “real” women and as\nthreats to feminist movements (Bettcher 2006, 2007; McKinnon 2018).\nHowever, there is another strand of feminist theory that has a\ndistinct relationship to trans issues, and (importantly for present\npurposes) it is a lineage of feminism that draws heavily on\nContinental figures such as Butler. While there is no doubt that\nButler’s work has been foundational in trans studies as well as\nin queer theory (Gerdes 2014; Salah 2007), it is also the case that\nher work has been critiqued for its selective use of trans experience\n(Prosser 1998; Namaste 1996; H. Rubin 1998). Critics point out that\ntrans identity tends be affirmed in Butlerian queer feminist discourse\nwhen it can be used to demonstrate the actual constructedness of\ngender, or its lack of ontological necessity, but also that some trans\nidentity is portrayed as problematically essentialist when accompanied\nby claims to “really be” a man or a woman and/or demands\nfor medical transition (Valentine 2012). While Prosser and Rubin both\ncritique this rejection of claims to gender realness from a\nphenomenological perspective (and Prosser (1998) from a psychoanalytic\nframework as well), Namaste (1996) focuses on the institutional\nreality of gender that is often sidelined in these debates. In\nresponse, Jack Halberstam has argued that, while Prosser’s\nfrustration with a selective use of trans identity in queer and\nfeminist theory is understandable, there are still significant\nproblems with the normativity inherent in the idea of gendered\nrealness (2005). \nNotably, the proliferation of non-trans feminist writers working on\ntrans issues in the 1990s led to Jacob Hale’s “Suggested\nRules for Non-Transsexuals Writing about Transsexuals, Transsexuality,\nTranssexualism, or Trans” (1997\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n Significant non-trans feminist analyses, following Hale and the\nemergence of transgender studies, include work by Cressida Heyes\n(2003) and Naomi Scheman (1996, 2016), both of whom articulate\ntheoretical bases for solidarity between cis and trans feminists.\nThere are also important instances of cis feminist theorists bringing\ntrans issues directly into their own work as serious interlocutors,\nrather than as thought experiments (Ahmed 2016b; Colebrook 2015;\nShotwell & Sangrey 2008) and collaborating with trans theorists\n(Heyes & Latham 2018). The term “cis” itself has also\nreceived more scholarly attention in the last two decades (Aultman\n2014). While the original intention behind the term was to\ndenaturalize non-trans subject positions, not all scholars agree that\nthe term successfully destabilizes gender norms, particularly insofar\nas such norms are racialized (Enke 2012b). \nMore recently, there have been many new trajectories established at\nthe crossroads of Continental and trans approaches to gender. A number\nof philosophers have written at the intersections of phenomenology and\ntrans studies, particularly in critical phenomenology, which\nemphasizes questions of oppression and power in examining how things\nappear to us in the world (Weiss, Murphy, & Salamon 2020). Ephraim\nDas Janssen uses phenomenology, including the work of Martin\nHeidegger, to examine what transgender experience tells us about\ngender (2017). Megan Burke (2019) takes up Beauvoirian concepts to\nexplore androgyny, trans identity, and agender experience. Gayle\nSalamon draws on the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to develop a\nphenomenology of transphobia in The Life and Death of Latisha\nKing (2018a). Salamon merges a tradition of earlier work in\nphenomenology and trans studies (H. Rubin 1998; Prosser 1998) with\ncritical phenomenology. Tamsin Kimoto (2018) has also used both\nMerleau-Ponty and Frantz Fanon to explore hormonal transition and\ntransphobia. \nAlong similar lines, new work in psychoanalysis and trans studies is\nalso revising longstanding psychoanalytic approaches to sex and\ngender, including coercive and pathologizing theories of trans\nsubjectivity (Elliot 2014), and is using resources in psychoanalysis\nto theorize trans experiences from a less pathologizing perspective\n(Breslow 2017; Carlson 2010; Coffman 2017; Cavanagh 2010). For\nexample, Amy Ray Stewart uses Julia Kristeva’s concept of\n“intimate revolt” to illuminate trans and queer\nexperiences of psychic life (2017). Patricia Gherovici (2017) has\nwritten about trans phenomena and the need to revise psychoanalytic\nconcepts using Lacanian theory and her own clinical experience working\nwith trans people. Relying on both psychoanalytic and phenomenological\nframeworks, Salamon (2010a) has also defended Butler’s account\nof gender against the aforementioned critiques of its treatment of\ntrans experience and developed her own psychoanalytic and\nphenomenological account of a dissonance between a felt sense of\ngender and an external appearance of a body that is attuned to trans\nexperience. \nThere is also a body of work emerging that puts foundational figures\nin Continental feminism into conversation with trans studies. Marie\nDraz (2018) has placed feminist philosophical uses of Nietzsche, such\nas in the work of Butler (1990) and Rosalyn Diprose (2002), into\nconversation with trans scholarship on the institutionalization of\ngender categories, while Tim Johnston (2015) has argued that although\nscholars of gender and sexuality have used Irigarayan resources for\ndiscussing trans and queer issues, Irigaray’s own claim that\nontology is sexed and that there is an impassable limit between the\nsexes conveys an unsalvageable cissexism, or privileging of non-trans\nexperience. In a similar vein, Oli Stephano (2019) critiques Elizabeth\nGrosz’s emphasis on the irreducibility of sexual difference,\nshowing that her ontology invalidates trans embodiment and\nsubjectivities. This critique of Grosz follows earlier work by Eva\nHayward (2017) on the transphobic implications of some of\nGrosz’s feminist materialist arguments. Gayle Salamon also\ncritically examines the way that sexual difference operates as a limit\nto the reimagining of embodiment and materiality in the work of both\nIrigaray and Grosz (Salamon 2010a). María Lugones is another\nfigure of widespread use in Continental feminism who has been\nregularly cited in scholarship on trans issues (Bettcher 2014b;\nDiPietro 2019; Draz 2017a; Malatino 2019). Finally, like Butler, the\nuse of Foucault in trans studies has also changed dramatically over\nthe last several decades. For example, Foucault’s work on types\nof modern power has been used (alongside women of color feminism,\nindigenous scholarship, and numerous other sources) to examine the\nviolence caused by how state institutions administer legal gender\ncategories in sex-segregated institutions and identity documents\n(Spade 2011 [2015]). Foucauldian feminist accounts of prison and\npunishment have also been put into conversation with scholarship\nrooted in trans and gender non-conforming experience (Dilts 2017;\nVitulli 2018; Zurn 2016, 2019). \nTrans studies continues, in different veins, many of the foundational\nquestions of Continental feminism by bringing the tools of Continental\nphilosophy to bear on questions of sex, gender, and sexuality, and\nvice versa, and it continually orients these conversations in new\ndirections. Much of this work is informed by other areas of critical\ntheory (e.g., critical race theory and decolonial theory) and pushes\nthe traditional boundaries of Continental feminism. Recent scholarship\non blackness and trans history, for example, has articulated the\nimportance of developing frameworks capable of understanding the\ndimensions of racialized gender historically and today (Snorton 2017)\nand work on migration and Latinx trans people has highlighted the need\nto attend to both the limits of our political theory and the\nproductive capacities of trans people of color for generating new\nworlds (Pitts 2018). Current conversations about the relationship\nbetween Continental feminism and trans studies must also involve\nattention to the material conditions of the academy itself, as the\ngrowing attention to trans experience in philosophy more broadly has\nnot resulted in more trans voices and trans academics (Bettcher 2018\n(Other Internet Resources); Marvin 2019, 2020). Future directions in\nContinental feminism and trans studies will need to be attentive not\nonly to the intriguing philosophical questions occurring in these\nconversations, but also to the specific contours of the material\nconditions that allow trans scholarship to flourish. \nThis section explores the relationship between Continental feminism\nand Asian American feminist thought, both the tensions between the two\nas well as new directions that this relation brings to Continental\nfeminism. A major point of convergence between the two fields is the\nfocus on lived experience of Asian American women. This section begins\nby discussing the hypervisibility that Asian American women experience\ndue to the specific forms of oppression that they face, namely,\norientalization and the Model Minority myth. It then highlights the\nparadoxical form of invisibility that Asian American feminist\nphenomenologist trace in their body of work. Next, this section\nconsiders the historical position of Asian American women in\ncoalitional feminist projects, especially focusing on the ways in\nwhich Asian American women have been relegated to a\n“tag-along” group. Finally, this section will highlight\nrecent scholarship in Continental feminism that engages with Asian\nAmerican feminist theory and draws upon both Eastern and Western\ntraditions. \nIt must be noted from the outset that “Asian” is an\nexceptionally broad term, and the peoples that are considered\nAsian/Asian American have often changed throughout history. In\naccordance with anthologies by Asian American women that respond to\nthis very issue, this section addresses the identities of women who\ntrace their roots back to East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian\nsubcontinent (Asian Women United of California 1989; The Women of\nSouth Asian Descent Collective 1993). \nIn This Bridge Called My Back (Moraga & Anzaldúa\n1981 [2015]), Asian American thinkers such as Genny Lim, Merle Woo, Nellie\nWong, and Mitsuye Yamada established their positions in feminist\ntheorizing by exploring their own perspectives on topics surrounding\ngendered identity, sexuality, silencing, the feeling of not-belonging,\nand living against stereotypes of Asian American women as docile,\nquiet, agreeable, and submissive. Similarly, in This Bridge We\nCall Home (Anzaldúa & Keating 2002), Minh-ha T. Pham,\nShirley Geok-Lin Lim, and Jid Lee theorize from the specific\nexperiences that they face as Asian American immigrant women, such as\nexploring a connection to an Asian mother who emigrated to the United\nStates, navigating the cultural connection they still hold to a land\nthat they may have never visited, and living in the face of the Model\nMinority myth while also subverting the stereotype. Writings that\ncenter the perspective of the Asian American and diasporic Asian woman\nare essential for Asian American feminist theorizing, for, as Sonia\nShah emphasized, \n[a]n Asian American feminist movement is the only movement\nthat will consistently represent Asian American women’s\ninterests. (1998: xix) \nTwo early anthologies were very important for the formation of Asian\nAmerican feminism: Making Waves (Asian Women United of\nCalifornia [AWUC] 1989) and The Forbidden Stitch (Lim &\nTsutakawa 1989); they both include writings from different ethnic and\nnational backgrounds, specifically Chinese, Japanese, Filipino,\nKorean, Vietnamese, and Indian (Hill-Collins & Bilge 2016: 73). In\na recent volume entitled Asian American Feminisms and Women of\nColor Politics, editors Lynn Fujiwara and Shireen Roshanravan\npresent a series of articles emerging at the intersection of Asian\nAmerican feminist engagement with Women of Color coalition politics,\norganizing around concepts, methods, and epistemic principles central\nto Women of Color feminist scholarship (Fujiwara & Roshanravan\n2018) \nHypervisibility of Asian American women is a central issue in most\nAsian American feminist projects. Some Asian American feminist\ntheorists, such as Robin Zheng, argue that Asian American women are\nhypervisible because they are hypersexualized, orientalized, and\nexoticized. Robin Zheng (2016) discusses the complexities of\nhypervisibility “Why Yellow Fever Isn’t Flattering: A Case\nAgainst Racial Fetishes”. Zheng argues that there is little\ndifference between what is known as “yellow fever”, the\nracial fetishization and preference of Asian women and men, and what\nshe calls the “Mere Preference Argument”, which attempts\nto claim that there is nothing morally wrong with preferring certain\nracialized phenotypic traits; as she shows, despite the origin of a\nracialized fetish, both yellow fever and other racialized fetishes\n“depersonalize and otherize” their subjects (2016: 412).\nZheng shows that these fetishes are not just harmless personal\npreferences, but a set of practices and thought patterns that result\nin negative social impacts for Asian American women. Relatedly, Asian\nAmerican women are also hypervisible due to the “Model Minority\nmyth”, that is, the myth that asserts that Asian Americans are\nuniquely hard-working and thus, the ideal “model”\nminority, especially in contrast with other minority groups. This myth\nmakes Asian American women hypervisible by making them a part of a\ngroup of people who are defined by their ability to achieve upward\nclass mobility (K. Lee 2014). \nParadoxically, Asian American women are also rendered invisible in\nvarious feminist movements and discourses. Asian American feminist\ndiscussions on invisibility differ from other discussions within\nContinental feminism on visibility and feminine erasure due to their\ndual existence as both invisible subjects and hypervisible\nrepresentations of stereotypes. Poet and activist Mitsuye Yamada\nstates that Asian American women are “the visible minority that\nis invisible” (1981b). Yamada means this claim in two ways:\nfirst, in regard to how Asian American women are rendered invisible in\nconversations surrounding women of color oppressions; and second, in\nregard to how the oppressions experienced by Asian American women are\noften invisible to themselves. In order to carve out a space for\nthemselves in feminist theorizing, Asian American women in this book\nshared their stories that demonstrate the struggle of becoming visible\nto oneself while existing in a world that constantly demands\none’s invisibility. Yamada’s explains how she was\ninvisible to herself because she practiced passive resistance while\nbelieving that others did not see her as the stereotype of an Asian\nAmerican women. In order to become visible to herself and others, she\nrealized that she must act in ways, such as displaying anger in\nresponse to sexist and racist acts, that an oppressive gaze would\nclaim was “uncharacteristic” of her as an Asian American\nwoman (1981b: 40). At the same time, the Model Minority myth can also\nparadoxically render Asian American women invisible by making them\nhypervisible as successful paradigms that are perceived as lacking\nexperiences of oppression and violence and thus have no credibility to\nspeak to these lived experiences. \nAs a result of this specific form of invisibility, Asian American\nfeminists proposed new methods of political organization in order to\ninclude the voices of Asian American women in feminist coalitions. The\nsimilarities between writings that span nearly two decades gesture to\none of the many issues faced by Asian American feminism: Asian\nAmerican feminists have often been seen, and arguably still are seen,\nas a group in the background that is simply, as Yamada described,\n“tagging along” in feminist theorization against\noppressions (1981b: 40). In other words, Asian American women are\noften seen as individuals who do not often experience oppressions that\nare specific to their own identities and, therefore, have no place in\nfighting oppression. In response to this, we can see activists such as\nGrace Lee Boggs, who have worked closely with other people of color in\nthe fight against different oppressions (Boggs & Boggs 1974; 1998\n[2016]; Boggs & Kurashige 2011); Lisa Lowe’s essay on\nheterogeneity, hybridity, and multipolicy of Asian American\nwomen’s experiences (Lowe 1991); and more recent Asian American\nfeminist projects that include Asian Americans women in liberatory\nprojects in a manner that does not simply relegate them to tag-along\npositions (Shah 1998; Fujiwara & Roshanravan, 2018). \nA growing number of recent works in Asian American feminism engage\nwith figures and themes in Continental feminism through the framework\nEastern philosophy and the Asian American women’s perspective\nand as such they provide new directions for a genuinely\ntransContinental feminism. For example, building on the discussions\nconcerning gender in Continental feminisms, thinkers such as Kyoo Lee\n(2014) and Robin Wang (2016) have explored different ways that the\ngendered body has been discussed. Engaging with the concept of the\n“dark female animal” (xuapin) in\nDaodejing, Kyoo Lee explores the revolutionary potential of\nxuapin, which she claims possesses a gender-bending power.\nLee argues that xuapin demonstrates \nin a sense, superiority of femaleness and femininity –as\nthe norm, albeit invisible and inaudible \nand that it is \ngender-bending: female and not female at once, heterosexualized and\nnot at once. (K. Lee 2014: 59) \nWang investigates yin-yang gender dynamics through a variety of both\nEastern and Western sources in order to answer whether yin-yang gender\nconstruction allows for gender equality. Alluding to Continental\nfeminists who wrote on gender such as Simone de Beauvoir, Judith\nButler, and Luce Irigaray, Wang discusses an exploration of gender\nthrough a Chinese framework (the yin-yang) that does not make a clear\ndistinction between sex and gender. Wang argues that yin-yang gender\nconstruction offers a dynamic and fluid description of gender\nrelationships (Wang 2016: 224). \nThis entry has listed a number of ways in which Continental approaches\nand figures are used to address feminist issues; we have attempted\nboth to describe some of the ongoing research areas in Continental\nfeminism and to point out new directions it has been taking over the\npast decades. However, this list remains incomplete as we have been\nunable to account for all of the important work underway. A more\ncomplete entry would need to include projects on the intersection\nbetween Continental feminism and critical disability studies,\nindigenous feminisms, and new materialisms and humanisms. Furthermore,\nwe do not mean to suggest that there is no overlap or intersection\nbetween the topics or figures grouped under each section heading here.\nLastly, there is certainly ongoing work of which we are not aware that\nis already making an impact on the present and future of feminist\nscholarship. We thus conclude here not with a summative statement\ndefining Continental feminism but rather by reflecting on the material\nconditions of Continental feminism. \nWhen Linda Martín Alcoff addressed the Eastern American\nPhilosophical Association in 2012, she reflected on the tension and\nissues within disciplinary philosophy and urged philosophers to\n“apply our diagnostic impulses to ourselves” (Alcoff 2013:\n43). A necessary aspect of such praxis for Continental feminists in\nlight of the genealogies considered here is exemplified by Audre Lorde\nwho, speaking on the “Personal is Political Panel” at the\nSecond Sex Conference in 1979, stated \nI urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of\nknowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any\ndifference that lives there. See whose face it wears. (Lorde 1984a:\n101) \nLorde calls feminists to enact a humble and frank confrontation with\ntheir own embodied lives and senses of self in the context of each\nperson’s differential implication in racist, sexist,\nheterosexist, classist and ableist power. Rather than imagining that\none puts on one’s thinking hat and reflects “as a\ntheorist” and then take it off and acts “as a regular\nperson”, Continental feminisms suggest that the subject who\ntheorizes is themself always an embodied subject: Kris Sealey reminds\nus that “Continental methods oftentimes refract differently\nacross race and gender axes” and that for this reason,\nContinental feminists ought “to be intentional about the\nrelationship they occupy, quite simultaneously, to racial and gender\nliberation” (Sealey 2017: 166). As this entry has shown, the\ndiversity of Continental feminist thought has been developed through\nthe thoughtful negotiation of many different struggles. For the\nimagined community of Continental feminism to continue to grow and\nsupport these projects, space must continually be made for new\npractitioners. Since, as we put above, Continental feminism is less\nconcerned with changing a woman’s place in a symbolic or social\nsystem, and more on upending that system itself, members of this\nacademic community must continue to do the work that will make it\npossible to learn from each other. Only in this way Continental\nfeminism can be opened up fully to its interdisciplinary\npotential.","contact.mail":"bkimoto@emory.edu","contact.domain":"emory.edu"},{"date.published":"2020-11-10","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/femapproach-continental/","author1":"Dilek Huseyinzadegan","author2":"Jana McAuliffe","entry":"femapproach-continental","body.text":"\n\n\n\n\n[Editor’s Note: The following new entry replaces the\n former entry\n on this topic by the previous author.]\n\n\n\n\nContinental feminism denotes an approach to feminist issues in\nphilosophy and the world both via figures and methods of what\nis called the “Continental” tradition in philosophy\nand via critical interventions into this tradition.\nContinental tradition in philosophy today refers to a set of\nnineteenth and twentieth century figures and theoretical traditions\nfrom mainland Europe, arising as a way for English-speaking\nphilosophers in the United States to distinguish their approach to\nphilosophical questions from that of the analytic tradition. By\nutilizing one or more of the signature schemas of the Continental\ntradition, Continental feminists contribute to problem areas ranging\nfrom metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, and social and\npolitical philosophy. Continental feminism thus refers to a body and\nstyle of work consisting of feminist interpretations of mainstream\nContinental figures (largely from what is called “Continental\nEurope”, such as Hegel, Levinas, Derrida, Foucault); feminist\nuses of psychoanalysis, phenomenology, deconstruction, genealogy, and\ncritical theory; and of interpretations of European feminists and\nfigures such as de Beauvoir, Irigaray, Arendt, and Kristeva. Note,\nhowever, that Europe is not and has never been a continent, and in\nthis sense, Continental feminism, like Continental philosophy, is more\nof an imagined community of approaches, figures, and traditions, or an\numbrella concept, rather than a precise term.\n\n\nElaine Miller points out that the term “Continental\nfeminism” came into circulation in the United States in 2007\n(Miller 2017); as she defines it, Continental feminism\n\n\n\n\ninvolves a commitment to the historicity of philosophical concepts,\nincluding the sometimes-uncomfortable contexts of their production, a\nbelief that it is through the examination of texts that the genealogy\nof ideas can be traced and resources for critically responding to them\ncan be formulated, and that the “canon” is subject to\nconstant re-interrogation and reconfiguration. (Miller 2017: 154)\n\n\n\nIn Allison Stone’s terms,\n\n\n\n\ndescribing the world as it really is—not as an aggregate of\nstatic items but as an ever-shifting web of relations—calls for\nunfamiliar, difficult language. (Stone 2015: 4)\n\n\n\nA distinguishing feature of Continental feminism, Miller and Stone\nagree, is that it\n\n\n\n\nembodies a refusal to prima facie privilege clarity and\nsuccinctness of argument over acknowledging through language the\ncomplexity, difficulty, and problematic nature of the issues being\naddressed. (Miller 2017: 154; Stone 2015: 2)\n\n\n\nAs a way of beginning to address the Euro- and U.S.-centric biases of\ncontinental philosophy, a transContinental turn in Continental\nfeminism proposed by Kyoo Lee and Alyson Cole aims to incorporate a\nglobal view of feminist issues and theories, where\n\n\n\n\n“trans” serves as a marker for the constant geo-cultural\nflows of ideas in transit, as in “transatlantic”,\n“transpacific”, “transoceanic”, etc., as well\nas for cutting-edge works, conversations, and debates in\ntrans-critical, cultural, disciplinary, human, gender, genic, lingual,\nmedial, national fields, etc., and as trans*feminist discourses. (Cole\nand Lee 2019: iv)\n\n\n\nAccordingly, this entry will take Continental feminism to include the\nfollowing distinct yet related set of issues and areas: (1) the\nfeminist use of figures, traditions, and approaches of\nphenomenology/existentialism, psychoanalysis, post-structuralism\n(deconstruction and genealogy), and critical theory; (2) critical\ninterventions into the assumptions about sex, gender, class, race,\nability, religion, and age endemic to European philosophy; and (3)\ninterpretations of hitherto underrepresented figures and methods of\nfeminism from a transContinental and transAtlantic perspective that\nestablish new, abandoned, or previously delegitimated genealogies for\nfeminist thought.\n\n\nIt is important to note that not all Continental feminists are\nphilosophers or work in Philosophy departments; thus, Continental\nfeminism is interdisciplinary and its practitioners come from various\nfields. As this subfield developed in the early 2000s, there were\nalready disciplinary, intra-disciplinary and extra-disciplinary\nprojects that explored feminist issues by utilizing phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, deconstructive, and critical theoretical approaches.\nRather than organizing this entry around the signature schemas of the\nContinental tradition and subsuming ongoing work that uses these\napproaches under them, this entry will locate crucial genealogies for\nContinental feminism in the work of Black feminists, post- and\ndecolonial feminists, women of color feminists, Asian American\nfeminists, trans feminists, and queer feminists. We take these\ngenealogies as central to the past, present, and future of Continental\nfeminism, and accordingly this entry is organized topically, in order\nto outline the ways that Continental feminisms have developed in\nconversation and in tension with these interdisciplinary projects.\nThese projects have been unearthing the cissexist,\nsexist/misogynistic, racist, heterosexist, classist, ageist, ableist,\ncolonial commitments of philosophy as a discipline and a professional\nfield as they are simultaneously expanding, transforming, and pushing\nthe concerns and methods of Continental thought in interdisciplinary\niterations. Indeed, what distinguishes Continental feminism clearly\nfrom Analytic feminism are its call for interdisciplinarity and its\nbelief that feminist omissions themselves can become sites from which\nnew projects are launched, as will be highlighted throughout this\nentry. As such, Continental feminism starts with the premise that\nEuropean or Anglo-American norms and categories of thought can be\ninterpreted, critiqued, and re-envisioned or abandoned for feminist\npurposes.\n\nContinental feminists share with other Continental thinkers an\ninterest in close reading that uses careful exegesis to unpack the\ndeep meanings of texts through attention to their linguistic and\nhistorical specificity. However, to utilize a philosophical tradition\nthat has largely presumed rather than explored the impacts of sex and\ngender on material life, continental feminists often read irreverently\nto focus on concerns that traditional philosophy might push to the\nside. While all feminist theorizing deals with questions of power,\nsubjectivity, and culture, Continental feminist approaches to these\nissues are often critical in the sense that they explore how\nexternal power dynamics affect the constitution of inner experiences,\nand in turn how embodied and subjective re-articulations of power can\nand should transform the world in the pursuit of justice. This\nfrequently involves taking lived experience as a crucial component of\ncritical philosophy; as Gail Weiss puts it, \nonly by interrogating the “ordinary” dimensions of\nexperience is it possible to arrive at an understanding of the dynamic\nforces that give meaning to individual lives and that are both the\nobstacle and the vehicle to achieving lasting social change. (Weiss\n2008: 5) \nTo present a broad sketch of characteristics of continental feminism\nthroughout its history, this section focuses on methods that\nContinental feminists use to engage embodied experience in their\nprojects. The gendered critique of the traditional Western\nphilosophical tendency to dichotomize the body that feels and the mind\nthat thinks is an ongoing theme in continental feminism (see entry on\n feminist perspectives on the body).\n The account presented here is not at all complete, as the specific\naims and methods of such feminist projects differ widely, most\nimportantly in terms of how an analysis of sex and gender is impacted\nby other aspects of embodied experience such as race, sexuality, and\nability. This section first addresses some ways that continental\nfeminists trouble a mind-body distinction by engaging affect and\nemotion in their work. Next, it explores two examples of how\ncontinental traditions, psychoanalysis and phenomenology, are made\ninto critical resources in Continental feminist projects. Finally, it\npresents work that engages an ongoing critique of culture and everyday\nexperience as an important aspect of feminist theorizing. \nMany Continental feminists focus on the overlaying of mental and\nphysical experience via the concepts of affect, emotion, and feeling.\nAffect is described by Teresa Brennan as “the physiological\nshift accompanying a judgment” (Brennan 2004: 5). The\n“transmission of affect” describes the way that one can\ncatch the mood of another; this experience is “social in origin\nbut biological and physical in effect” (Brennan 2004: 3).\nBrennan describes transmission as when the “emotions or\naffects of one person, and the enhancing or depressing energies these\naffects entail” pass from one person to another (Brennan 2004:\n3). Affect is thus one way to describe how social experience impacts\nthe corporeal life of subjects through the transference of energy. In\nBrennan’s case, affective states are directional; they\nare not neutral but push or press on subjects. At the same time, terms\nlike affect and feeling might be distinguished based on the extent to\nwhich one considers affect to be already coded with or influenced by\nsocial significance for a subject (see Ahmed 2010: 230–231,\nSeigworth & Gregg 2010, esp. 5–8). \nContinental feminist projects on emotion often analyze historically\ncontextualized experiences. Ann Cvetkovich engages with trauma in a\nway that \nfocuses on the everyday and the insidious…and situates it in a\nsocial and cultural frame rather than a medical one. (Cvetkovich 2007:\n464) \nShe then presents a political account of depression that\ndepathologizes such negatively-connotated emotional experiences so\nthat they can become more visible in public and thus create a\npotential foundation for community (Cvetkovich 2007: 460). In The\nCultural Politics of Emotion, Sara Ahmed argues that emotion is\ngenerated when meaning is produced across social-political\ninteraction; these feelings create the boundaries of affinity groups\nand impact self-understanding. In this analysis, emotions help\nconstitute what a person understands as their objective condition, and\nthus \nemotions are not “in” either the individual or the social,\nbut produce the very surfaces and boundaries that allow all kinds of\nobjects to be delineated. (Ahmed 2004 [2014: 10]) \nBecause feeling is often ambivalent and multi-faceted, rather than in\nspite of this complexity, social critics who attend to how affects are\nemployed and manipulated in both textual and social-political\nargumentation can produce readings that trouble an easy dichotomy\nbetween what is a “good” and what a “bad”\nexperience. \nPsychoanalytically-informed projects use concepts such as trauma,\nmourning, melancholia, and abjection to analyze embodied experience\n(Irigaray 1974 [1985]; Spillers 1996; Butler 1997; Felman 2002; Oliver\n2004; entry on\n psychoanalytic feminism).\n They frequently engage aesthetics as an aspect of social critique\n(Chanter 2008; Kristeva 1980 [1982]; Miller 2014). This allows a\nsymptomatic reading of feeling to be interpreted back against the\nsocial order, as is seen in Judith Butler’s Frames of\nWar. In this text, Butler analyzes what makes a life grievable\nand argues that the questions of who appears as a human, whose life\nshould be protected, and who does not are all figured in advance of\nany particular political decision through a pre-reflexive manipulation\nof affect (Butler 2009 [2016: 64]). Supplementing democratic theory\nwith Continental feminist interpretations, Noëlle McAfee deploys\nKristeva and the resources in her thought, as well as psychoanalysis,\nspecifically on the issues of affect and the notion of the\n“political unconscious” (McAfee 2000 and 2008). \nCritical phenomenologists draw on the methods of phenomenology to\ndemonstrate “the multiple ways in which power moves through our\nbodies and our lives” (Introduction, Weiss, Murphy, &\nSalamon 2020: xiv). Lisa Guenther understands critical phenomenology\nas both a way of doing philosophy and a way of approaching political\nactivism (Guenther 2020: 15). Most characteristically, Guenther argues\nthat critical phenomenology employs reworked versions of \nMerleau-Ponty’s concept of the body schema to account for\ngendered and sexual schemas (Simone de Beauvoir, Iris Marion Young,\nTalia Mae Bettcher, Gayle Salamon), racialized schemas (Frantz Fanon,\nLewis Gordon, Sara Ahmed, George Yancy, Alia Al-Saji), disability\nschemas (Kay Toombs, Lisa Diedrich, Havi Carel), and other aspects of\nlived experience. (Guenther 2020: 13–14) \nA recent volume edited by Gail Weiss, Ann V, Murphy, and Gayle\nSalamon, entitled 50 Concepts for a Critical* Phenomenology\n(2020), shows that many of the central concepts of critical\nphenomenology intersect with Continental feminism. \nFinally, considering the social and political import of inner states\nand the centering of quotidian experiences of power enable Continental\nfeminists to explore culture as it develops. For instance, Shannon\nSullivan’s Good White People: The Problem with Middle-Class\nAnti-Racism focuses on “the personal side of whiteness and\nwhite privilege” with attention to the embodied experience of\nrace (S. Sullivan 2014: 19) to critique the ways through which white\nliberals set themselves up as altruistic, “good” white\npeople through, e.g., hypocritical modes of tolerance that maintain\nwhite domination (S. Sullivan 2014: 4). Robin James’\nResilience & Melancholy explores pop music as a way to\nanalyze the impact of neoliberal biopolitics; she combines music\ntheory with psychoanalytic and Foucauldian philosophies to critique\ncomplicity with multi-racial white supremacist patriarchy and argues\nthat music, e.g., Rihanna’s, offer strategies for countering\nthis oppressive power (R. James 2015). In Irony in the Age of\nEmpire: Comic Perspectives on Philosophy and Freedom, Cynthia\nWillett engages film and stand-up comedy to articulate a libidinal\nunderstanding of freedom that can counter the liberal paradigms of\nindividuality with a sense of freedom defined “in terms of\nequality and solidarity” (Willett 2008: 14). Erin Tarver\nanalyzes practices of sports fans, with particular attention to\nfootball, baseball, and basketball fans in the American South, to\nbetter understand how individual and group identities are maintained\nto “…shore up, reproduce, and very occasionally, subvert\nracial, sexual and gender hierarchies” (Tarver 2017: 3). This\nwork is often interdisciplinary, and some of these projects work at\nthe intersection between continental and pragmatist feminisms (see\nentry on\n intersections between pragmatist and continental feminism). \nSimultaneously reading carefully and irreverently, continental\nfeminists deepen the philosophical account of experience by\nintegrating historically contextualized feeling into their projects,\nusing and transmuting philosophical traditions and traditional\nfigures, and interrogating everyday experiences in their embodied and\ncultural specificity. This work insists that meaning and social order\nfunction through unrecognized cooptation, subordination or exclusion\nin various intersectional constellations. In general, continental\nfeminisms are less concerned with changing a woman’s place in a\nsymbolic or social system, and more focused on upending such systems,\nas will be explored in more detail in the following sections. \nThis section on the convergences between Black and Continental\nfeminist thought begins with a discussion about the history of Black\nfeminist scholarship utilizing existential/phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, critical, and hermeneutic approaches. It then\nintroduces intersectionality as the major heuristic for Black feminist\ntheorizing, and concludes by highlighting emerging areas and\nintersections between Black studies and Black feminist Continental\nthought. \nBlack women have long been contributors to the Continental\nphilosophical tradition. One may argue that their contributions to\nprofessional philosophy started after the graduation of the first\nBlack woman to earn the PhD in philosophy, Joyce Mitchell Cook, who\ncompleted the degree in 1965 from Princeton University. Even prior to\nthis date, however, Black women engaged in projects that we can\nrecognize as Continental feminist projects. Importantly, \nmany Black intellectuals in the United States going back (at least) to\nthe nineteenth century offered what are now described as existential,\nphenomenological, and/or genealogical analyses of race and racism.\n(Belle 2012, 329 fn. 1) \nThese contributions did not always occur in the form of traditional\nphilosophical discussions, nor are they always created by those who\nhave professional degrees in philosophy, which is certainly true of\nthe nineteenth and early twentieth century thinkers, Sojourner Truth,\nMaria W. Stewart, and\n Anna Julia Cooper. \nBlack feminists’ contributions to Continental philosophy\ndemonstrate the ways in which their voices are crucial to both shaping\nand expanding the discipline. Kathryn Sophia Belle, Donna-Dale\nMarcano, and Maria del Guadalupe Davidson edited Convergences:\nBlack Feminism and Continental Philosophy (del Guadalupe et al.\n2010), the only text at the publication of this entry that addresses\nboth these topics simultaneously. For the editors, the concept of\nconvergence is demonstrated by the natural, historical, and necessary\nengagement of Black women with Continental philosophy. Belle\nwrites, \nBlack feminist and womanist thinkers inevitably address the very same\nissues of agency, identity, alienation, power, and so on that are\nraised in much recent Continental philosophy. Likewise, from Immanuel\nKant to the feminist thinkers of the present, Continental philosophy\nhas engaged, to some extent, with issues of race and gender. (2010:\n5) \nThe Black feminist tradition in Continental philosophy demonstrates\nthat Black women are not strangers nor enemies of Continental\nphilosophy; rather, their unique theoretical positioning affords them\nthe opportunity to utilize, challenge, and expand the tradition. \nBlack feminist thinkers contribute to Continental feminist thought in\nat least two ways. First, they engage directly with Continental\nfigures and theories. For example, Lorraine Hansberry comments that\nSimone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex (1949, translated\nin 1953) was arguably the “most important work of this\ncentury” (1957 [1995: 129 and 133]), and Antillean thinker\nPaulette Nardal draws on both features of the Harlem Renaissance and\nexistentialist thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre to provide a\nphenomenological and genealogical account of how the Black race, and\nAntilleans in particular, have come to understand their own notion of\nrace consciousness in “The Awakening of Race\nConsciousness” (1932). More recently, they engage with canonical\nfigures and ideologies of Continental philosophy, as in the work of\nKathryn Sophia Belle on Hannah Arendt (2014) or Kris Sealey on\nEmmanuel Levinas (2014). Second, regardless of their professional\nPhilosophy degrees or lack thereof, Black feminist thinkers utilize\nthe tools of the Continental tradition as part of their\ninterdisciplinary approaches, as in the use of Foucault in the work of\nSylvia Wynter (2003) and the use of Freud, Lacan, and psychoanalysis\nin the work of Hortense Spillers (1996). \nBlack feminist thinkers have frequently used intersectionality as an\neffective entry-point into conversations with the Continental\ntradition. Intersectionality is a Black feminist theory that describes\nthe oppression that Black women experience as a result of lying at the\nnexus of simultaneously impactful identities, such as that of race,\ngender, class, and sexuality. As such, intersectionality can be used\nas a phenomenological tool to describe Black women’s lived\nexperience of oppression. While legal theorist Kimberlé\nCrenshaw coined the term in 1989, the theory has been articulated at\nleast since the mid-nineteenth century in Sojourner Truth’s\nproclamation, “Ain’t I a Woman?” (1851). In the\nspeech, Truth highlights that Black women are treated with less\nrespect than white women while bearing the same burdens of racism as\nBlack men. Anna Julia Cooper wrote that Black women are \nconfronted by a both a woman question and a race problem and is as yet\nan unknown or an unacknowledged factor in both. (1892 [1988: 134]) \nIn their collective statement from April 1977, The Combahee River\nCollective argues that \nBlack feminism [is] the logical political movement to combat the\nmanifold and simultaneous oppressions that all women of color face \nand that \n[t]here is also undeniably a personal genesis for Black feminism, that\nis, the political realization that comes from the seemingly personal\nexperiences of individual Black women’s lives. (Taylor 2017: 15\nand 17) \nIntersectionality is thus a hallmark of Black feminist thought because\nit prioritizes the lived experiences of Black women. In doing so, it\nsupplies the tools to think about the extent to which one’s\nconsciousness the world is informed by experiences of racism, sexism,\nclassism, and homophobia. \nIn addition to its utility in explaining Black women’s lived\nexperience, intersectionality also provides tools for Black feminists\nto critique the presumed whiteness and bourgeois-class status of\nfeminism and to combat various forms of oppression and violence. Thus,\nintersectionality is also key to critiquing phenomenological analysis,\nthat is, analysis of lived experiences and feminist movements through\nthe lens of sociopolitical identities such as race, sex, and class.\nAngela Davis’s text Women, Race, & Class (1981) is\nan early model of this approach; it details the history of U.S.\nwomen’s movements and their consideration, or lack thereof, of\nthe class-based and racial dimensions of womanhood. Texts such as\nPatricia Hill-Collins’s Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge,\nConsciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment (1990 [2015]) underscore\nthe ways in which Black women create their own epistemological\nstandpoint as a result of their lived experiences. In the 1970s to\n90s, when Black women’s contributions to academia reached its\nzenith, Black feminist scholars such as Barbara Christian in\n“The Race for Theory” (1988), Toni Morrison in Playing\nin the Dark (1992), and Audre Lorde in “The Master’s\nTools will Never Dismantle the Master’s House” (1984a) and\n“Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference”\n(1984b) exemplified Black women’s critiques of theoretical\napproaches that adopt a “neutral” stance toward feminist\nmovements where neutral meant presuming all women to be white,\nmiddle-class, young or middle-aged, and heterosexual (see also Hull,\nBell-Scott, & Smith 1982). \nCurrent Black feminist work centers Black epistemologies,\npractices, and concepts. The burgeoning scholarship of Black women\nphilosophers continue to push the boundaries of Continental feminism,\nas in the work of Lindsey Stewart’s work on Black feminist\npractices of freedom (2017), Camisha Russell’s work on the\nissues of race and gender in assisted reproduction (2018), and Axelle\nKarera’s work, which focuses on the Anthropocene and\nantiBlackness (2019). In addition to engaging with the canonical\nfigures of the Continental tradition, Black thinkers harvest\nphilosophy from their own perspective and experience of the world as\nwell as their theoretical archives. Much of this more recent work\nintersects with Black Studies. The work of Black thinkers from\ndisciplines other than philosophy are intersecting with Continental\nphilosophical and feminist approaches, as seen in the works of such as\nSaidiya Hartman (1997, 2007, and 2019), Christina Sharpe (2016),\nRizvana Bradley (2014 and 2018), Jennifer Nash (2019), Denise Ferreira\nda Silva (2007, 2014, and 2018), Riley Snorton (2017), Selamawit\nTerrefe (2020), and Zakiyyah Iman Jackson (2020). \nContinental feminist approaches to questions on colonialism revolve\naround two main sets of investigations: on the one hand, the\ninterrogation of the hegemony of the West as an abstract category that\nis deployed strategically to exclude and inferiorize communities\ndeemed Non-Western (Spivak 1999; Narayan 1997; Mohanty 1984), and on\nthe other hand, the question of coloniality, which focuses on the\npolitical and epistemic ordering of the globe starting with the\ncolonization of the Americas (Lugones 2003; Wynter 1995; Ortega 2016).\nTo this end, these approaches both use schemas of the Continental\ntradition (such as phenomenology, psychoanalysis, genealogy,\ndeconstruction, and poststructuralism) and call into question the\ngeographic and racial assumptions that underlie Continental\nphilosophy. For both of these approaches, an analysis of colonialism\nis inseparable from the political aim of challenging and undoing the\ncolonial world. This challenge entails deconstructing the categories\nof the colonially determined globe (such as East-West,\nWestern-Non-Western, Developed-Underdeveloped, First World-Third\nWorld, North-South) through focusing on the concrete lived experiences\nof individuals and communities. This section focuses on the general\ncharacteristics of these two Continental feminist approaches taken up\nunder the rough categories of postcolonial and decolonial feminisms,\nwith the former focusing on the Western-Non-western divide that marks\ncolonial relations, and the latter on the North-South dialogues that\nemerge within the relations of coloniality. It concludes by\nhighlighting coalitional thinking, a fundamental aspect of both post-\nand decolonial feminist approaches. \nPostcolonial feminist approaches maintain that in order to interrogate\nthe hegemony of the West, it is necessary to deconstruct the ways in\nwhich it is deployed to exclude the non-Western subject. Furthermore,\nsuch deployment is always a strategic one, insofar as the\n“West” is not a concrete geographical category, and the\nparadigm of Western subjectivity is continuously built by demarcating\nthose who do not fit in it. Postcolonial feminisms are\ninterdisciplinary and not limited to the field of philosophy, and they\nchallenge the inscription of the gender, racial, and geographic\ncategories that underlie the hegemony of the Western subject. In doing\nso, Continental feminist approaches engage with figures from\npoststructuralism and critical theory (such as Foucault, Derrida,\nDeleuze and Adorno), and they deploy methods such as genealogy and\ndeconstruction (Spivak 1988; Mohanty 1984), in order to question the\nunderlying geographic and gendered assumptions of these methods. In\n“Can the Subaltern Speak?” for example, Gayatri\nChakravorty Spivak engages with French poststructuralism and questions\nthe paradigms of speech/reason that deny the very possibility of\ncapacities such as resistance for those that do not fit within the\ngeographic, racialized, and gendered boundaries of Western\nSubjectivity (Spivak 1988). In doing so, she highlights the ways in\nwhich poststructuralism relies upon the very categories (of speech,\nreason, or universal subjectivity) that it ostensibly critiques. \nThe tension highlighted by Spivak, in which the Western Subject\nconstitutes both the dominant subject and the only subject capable of\nresistance, underlies postcolonial feminisms’ critique of the\nalignment of the West with modernity and progress (McClintock 1995;\nStoler 1995). Chandra Talpade Mohanty, in “Under Western\nEyes”, criticizes the hegemony of Western approaches in defining\nthe scope and goals of feminist struggles. Issues such as the veil\ndebate, in this sense, point to the political and phenomenological\nracialization of the Non-Western woman (Al-Saji 2010; Sheth 2006). At\nthe same time, Uma Narayan draws attention to the risks of fetishizing\nthe category of the Non-Western and highlights how such a\nfetishization remains within colonially determined divisions (Narayan\n1997; Narayan & Harding 2000). Namita Goswami, in Subjects\nThat Matter, develops heterogeneity as a kind of conceptual\ncontinuity between feminism, philosophy, and postcolonial studies,\nwhich allows for an understanding of difference beyond oppositional\nand antagonistic terms (Goswami 2019). \nDecolonial feminisms emerge primarily from the U.S. Latina and Latinx\ncontexts and have a different genealogy, insofar as they are in\ndialogue with Latin American Philosophy, Continental Philosophy,\nAnglo-American Thought, and especially U.S. Women of Color feminisms.\nFocusing on North-South dialogues, Latin American and Latina Feminist\nphilosophers such as Ofelia Schutte engage with the work of figures\nsuch as Nietzsche, Kristeva, and Irigaray while developing Latin\nAmerican philosophy as a field in U.S. academic philosophy (Schutte\n1984; 1993; for more, see the entry on\n Latin American feminism).\n Linda Martín Alcoff, for example, brings Latin American\nPhilosophy (particularly the work of Enrique Dussel) in dialogue with\nexistentialism and poststructuralism in order to develop the framework\nfor Latinx feminisms (Alcoff 2006, 2015). \nOne of the major frameworks of decolonial feminisms is “the\ncoloniality of power”, a term first introduced by Aníbal\nQuijano, and defined as “the social classification of the\nworld’s population around the idea of race” (Quijano 2000:\n1). In this sense, the colonization of the Americas is not only a\nhistorical moment, but also the emergence of race and the subsequent\nreorganization of the globe in accordance with what Walter Mignolo\ncalls “the colonial difference”, denoting the abstract\npositioning of Europe as the global hegemonic power (Mignolo 2002).\nDecolonial feminisms take an intersectional approach to the\ncoloniality of power and investigate, as María Lugones says,\n“the emergence of hegemonic gender arrangements along\n‘racial’ lines” starting with the colonization of\nthe Americas (Lugones 2007: 190). Decolonial feminists such as Lugones\nand Wynter bring poststructuralist critique in dialogue with Latin\nAmerican philosophy and argue that dominant gender arrangements\nthemselves are colonial; these arrangements, such as patriarchy,\nheterosexualism, or gender dimorphism mark concrete historical\nprocesses of the racial inscription of gender norms, starting from and\nwith the coloniality of power (Lugones 2008; Oyěwùmí\n2007; Wynter 2006). \nDecolonial feminisms’ emphasis on historical critique is\ninseparable from a concern with the concrete lived experiences of\nwomen of color (Moraga and Anzaldúa 1981 [2015]; Pérez\n1999; Lugones 2007, Sandoval 2000). Gloria Anzaldúa, in\nBorderlands/La Frontera, emphasizes bordered thinking as the\nunderlying logic of contemporary systems of oppression, and she\nformulates the resistances of hybrid identities that emerge both out\nof and in response to such bordered thinking (Anzaldúa 1987).\nMariana Ortega develops Latina feminist phenomenology in emphasizing\nboth the lived experience of borderlands and exile, and the\npossibilities of resistance by developing “home-tactics”\nin and through these experiences (Ortega 2016). \nCoalitional thinking is a fundamental aspect of both post- and\ndecolonial feminist approaches. Mohanty calls for coalitions across\nborders in thinking through the concrete lived experiences and\nemphasizes the importance of situated and local struggles in\nunderstanding hegemonic power relations.  Moraga and Anzaldúa,\nin their coedited collection This Bridge Called My Back, call\nfor concrete and sustained coalitions that are based on an\nintersectional understanding of women’s lives, rather than\nabstract calls for sisterhood. Decolonial feminists such as Lugones,\nChela Sandoval, Ortega, and Emma Pérez, maintain that\ncoalitional thinking cannot be an afterthought for any anti- or\ndecolonial struggles (Pérez 1999; Sandoval 2000). \nAs Continental feminism expands, it involves further conversations\nwith and in-between these approaches. The questions around the\n“continent” of Continental feminism, as well as how such a\ncontinent is situated within the colonial geographic boundaries of the\nWest and the Global North, continue to be challenged. As spaces for\nsuch a flow of ideas open up, further conversations on the possibility\nof coalition, as well as on challenging the limits of colonial thought\ncontinue to reshape the face of Continental feminism. \nThe relationship between Continental feminism and queer theory is\nsimultaneously productive and fraught. While far from exhaustive, this\nentry will first highlight some of the overlapping figures and\napproaches between the two fields, including examples of scholarship\nat their intersections. It will then briefly introduce one account of\nthe tension between them. Finally, it will close with some reflections\non the shared problems across these fields, including their\nhistorically white and Anglo-Eurocentric approaches, as well as how\nrecent work in queer of color critique aligns with and points to new\ndirections in Continental feminism. \nIn the late 1980s and the early 1990s, “queer” emerged as\na reclamation of a homophobic slur and a rallying cry for a coalition\nof the marginalized against the tyranny of the normal (Barker &\nScheele 2016; D. Hall & Jagose 2012; Warner 1993; Sedgwick 1993;\nAnzaldúa 1991 [2009]). Formed in the crucible of the AIDS\ncrisis, which sharpened the need to understand the violence\nexperienced by people excluded by norms related to gender and\nsexuality, “queer” was meant to bring attention to the\nrange of sexual/gender practices deemed outside the purview of the\nnormal. In one genealogy of queer theory, the field develops this\nearly activist reclamation of the term queer into a wide-reaching\ncritique of how norms operate in and through dominant\nconceptualizations of identity. Given this motivating impulse of\ndeconstruction, or of denaturalizing categories such as sexuality, it\nis perhaps of no surprise that queer theory has historically been a\nfield well-populated with figures (e.g., Lacan, Foucault, Derrida) and\nmethodological approaches (poststructuralism, psychoanalysis,\nphenomenology) that have been associated with Continental philosophy,\nespecially twentieth century European philosophy. \nQueer theory frequently draws on, critiques, and expands the ideas of\nmany figures and approaches that are seen as early progenitors of\nContinental feminism (e.g., Beauvoir, Irigaray, Kristeva, feminist\nphenomenology, feminist poststructuralism, critical theory,\npsychoanalytic theory). As Jagose (2009) points out, however, the\ncritique of normative identity categories was not invented by queer\ntheory, given that feminist scholarship has a rich history of\nradically disrupting the category of women along lines of race and\nsexuality. Moreover, the lines between feminism and queer theory are\nhistorically blurred. For example, Judith Butler—who is often\ncited as an originator of queer theory—explicitly marks her\nearly work as occurring in the intersection of these fields (as well\nas a number of other critical discourses) (1997). In Gender\nTrouble (1990) and Bodies that Matter (1993), Butler\ndraws on Continental feminist figures such as Irigaray, Beauvoir, and\nKristeva, and methods ranging from psychoanalysis to poststructuralism\nand phenomenology to develop a simultaneously queer and feminist\ntheoretical lens focused on understanding the relationship between\ngender and sexuality, as well as the operation of norms and identity\ncategories more broadly (Salih 2002). \nA second major figure in the relationship between Continental feminism\nand queer theory is Michel Foucault, who has been extensively used in\nboth queer and Continental (and specifically poststructuralist)\nfeminist theory, but who (as opposed to Butler) did not explicitly use\nthe terms queer and feminist. While a larger account of the connection\nbetween Foucault and queer theory is beyond the scope of this entry,\nthe relationship is a rich one. In the late 1980s, Foucault’s\nThe History of Sexuality, Volume One was read\nheavily by activists and scholars questioning dominant narratives\naround sexuality and identity (Halperin 1995); Foucault’s work\nwas also influential not only for Judith Butler’s Gender\nTrouble (1990) but also for another text often cited as\nfoundational for queer theory, Eve Sedgwick’s Epistemology\nof the Closet (1990 [2008]). \nFoucault’s genealogical approach to identity, including his\nexploration of the histories and models of power at work in modern\nconceptions of sexuality, has been important for a number of\ncontemporary scholars working at the intersections of feminism and\nqueer theory (Huffer 2010 and 2020; Russell 2010; Sawicki 2005;\nSchotten 2018; Winnubst 2006). For example, Ladelle McWhorter (1999)\ntakes up Foucault’s account of ethics as a practice of the self,\nor how we work on ourselves to become particular kinds of people,\nthrough a queer framework that resists expected developmental\ntrajectories and normative timelines of a life (e.g., heterosexual\ncoupling resulting in marriage and children). And in a different vein,\nJasbir Puar (2007) has drawn on Foucault’s theories of power (as\nwell as a wide range of interdisciplinary theory including\npostcolonial feminist theory) to analyze the relationship between\ncontemporary biopower and homonationalism, or how certain\n“good” gay and lesbian subjects, by aligning themselves\nwith U.S. imperialism, are welcomed into the nation-state. \nFigures associated with Continental feminism who do not necessarily\nmark themselves or their work as queer have also been used in queer\ntheoretical projects, just as feminists have historically done with\nany number of non-feminist philosophers. For example, queer studies\nscholars have explored the relative absence of Irigaray in queer\ntheory, argued for the queer resources of her thinking (Huffer 2013;\nWinnubst 2006), called attention to the potential use of\nIrigaray’s disruption of binaries for queer analyses of identity\n(Butler 1993: 36–39; Grosz 1989), and used Irigarayan concepts\nto develop queer analyses of longstanding feminist issues, such as the\nexperience of breast feeding (R. Lee 2018). \nPhenomenological methods can also track this traffic between\nContinental feminism and queer theory. For example, Sara Ahmed’s\nQueer Phenomenology (2006) explores the use of phenomenology\nin queer studies by asking, among other questions, how to understand\nthe “orientation” of sexual orientation as the way bodies\nare directed towards particular objects and away from others. In\ndeveloping this queer use of phenomenology, Ahmed acknowledges her\ndebt to feminist philosophers of the body such as Sandra Bartky, Iris\nMarion Young, Rosalyn Diprose, and Gail Weiss, as well as early\nphenomenologists such as de Beauvoir and phenomenologists of race\nincluding Linda Alcoff, Frantz Fanon, and Lewis Gordon. \nGiven these examples of the overlap of figures and approaches in\nContinental feminism and queer theory, it is worth asking what\ndistinguishes the approaches. One may be tempted to say that feminism\nfocuses more on gender (historically, within continental feminism,\nthis may be more commonly discussed as sexual difference) and queer\ntheory focuses more on sexuality (including questions of pleasure,\ndesire, and eroticism). Yet many working within Continental feminism,\nespecially as inflected with French theory, also focus on questions\nrelated to sexuality such as pleasure, desire, and eroticism. And\nthere are also reasons to be suspicious of how the gender-sexuality\nsplit is narrated as a feminist-queer split. While some have argued\nthat there are good reasons to draw distinctions between these fields\nin order to do justice to their distinct concerns (G. Rubin 2011;\nHalley 2006), there have also been many challenges to overly\nprogrammatic forms of this separation (Huffer 2013) and accounts of\nhow this narrative can overlook the field’s mutual interest in\nunderstanding the complex relationship between gender and sexuality,\nas well as the possibility of a queer feminism (Jagose 2009).\nNevertheless, despite the overlaps in figures and archives, as well as\nthe wealth of resources in queer theory on topics that Continental\nfeminist philosophers hold dear (temporality, embodiment, identity,\nand desire, to name only a few), the relatively slow uptake of texts\nmarked explicitly as queer theory has been noticeable (Winnubst 2010).\nThis is not to erase the important work done at the intersections of\nthese fields but to acknowledge that the relationship is not a\nseamless one. In their introductory comments to a “Roundtable on\nContinental Feminism”, Lynne Huffer and Shannon Winnubst (2017)\nnote the relative lack of engagement with queer theory among the\ncontributions, and they ask whether Continental feminism is capacious\nenough to embrace queer theory, a question that has also been posed to\nphilosophy more broadly (Ahmed 2016b; Salamon 2009; Winnubst\n2010). \nFinally, both Continental feminism and queer theory have also been\nextensively critiqued for the whiteness and Anglo-Eurocentric nature\nof their archives. In one particularly well-known rendition of this\ncritique, Cathy Cohen asks whether queer theory has lived up to its\nanti-identitarian promise of creating coalitions across difference\n(2005). As a way to intervene in the whiteness of queer theory\n(Johnson and Henderson 2005), Roderick Ferguson (2004) coined the\nterm “queer of color critique” to describe how various\nintersections of race, gender, sexuality, and class operate in\nnationalistic discourses of identity and belonging; it is, in\nFerguson’s words, \na heterogenous enterprise made up of women of color feminism,\nmaterialist analysis, poststructuralist theory, and queer critique.\n(Ferguson 2004: 149) \nOther notable and early contributors to this sub-field include\nJosé Muñoz, E. Patrick Johnson, Chandan Reddy, and\nGayatri Gopinath. Although the topics at work in queer of color\ncritique concerning identity, embodiment, temporality, and affect have\nalso been topics of central interests to Continental feminists, the\nuptake of queer of color critique, as with queer theory, has been slow\nin Continental feminism. However, as Continental feminism\nexpands—as shown through this entry— the resources of\nqueer theory and queer of color critique are waiting in the wings as\ncrucial, if at times under acknowledged, interlocutors. \nLike Continental feminism, queer theory and queer of color critique\ncontinue the longstanding feminist tradition of sending texts and\nideas in directions they were perhaps never intended to travel. Recent\ntrajectories at the crossroads of Continental feminism and queer\nstudies include attention to neoliberal capitalism (Winnubst 2015;\nMcWhorter 2012), sex and gender in ancient Greek metaphysics (Bianchi\n2014); critical disability theory (Puar 2017; K. Hall 2014; Yergeau\n2018; and Gallop 2019), Latina feminism and existential phenomenology\n(Ortega 2016), affect and temporality (Ahmed 2019; Amin 2017; Freeman\n2019), and materialism and concepts of agency (Chen 2012). As explored\nin the next section, another important interlocutor with both\nContinental feminism and queer theory is transgender studies. \nA number of scholars have noted the complex interplay of shared and\ndistinct concerns between trans, feminist, and queer frameworks\n(Namaste 1996 and 2009; Prosser 1998; Heyes 2003; Salamon 2010a;\nStryker 2004). Emerging in the 1990s as a distinct field of academic\ninquiry, trans studies shares many of the intellectual roots of queer\ntheory yet also departs from queer studies through its explicit focus\non trans experience, including both non-monolithic nature of that\nexperience and the importance of trans people speaking for themselves\nabout their own lives. Likewise, while many of the theoretical\nframeworks and figures at the heart of Continental feminism are\npresent in trans studies (e.g., post-structuralism, phenomenology,\nFoucauldian genealogy, materialism), there have also been important\ncritiques of how Continental feminist approaches can ignore or\nsideline trans experience. Significantly, many of the philosophers\nworking in Continental feminism and trans studies cited in this entry\ncross inter- and intra-disciplinary boundaries. \nIn exploring the relationship between Continental feminist and trans\nstudies, it is crucial to acknowledge the forms that transphobia and\ntrans-exclusionary gestures can assume in feminist discourse more\ngenerally. For an extended overview of this history, see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on trans issues.\n The entry explains points of terminology (trans, transgender, trans*,\ntranssexual), as well as the historical emergence of transgender\nstudies and the broader (i.e., non-Continental specific) relationship\nbetween feminist and trans issues. \nIn one widely recognized form of feminist transphobia (found in the\nwork of trans-exclusionary radical feminists such as Janice Raymond),\ntrans women are portrayed as not “real” women and as\nthreats to feminist movements (Bettcher 2006, 2007; McKinnon 2018).\nHowever, there is another strand of feminist theory that has a\ndistinct relationship to trans issues, and (importantly for present\npurposes) it is a lineage of feminism that draws heavily on\nContinental figures such as Butler. While there is no doubt that\nButler’s work has been foundational in trans studies as well as\nin queer theory (Gerdes 2014; Salah 2007), it is also the case that\nher work has been critiqued for its selective use of trans experience\n(Prosser 1998; Namaste 1996; H. Rubin 1998). Critics point out that\ntrans identity tends be affirmed in Butlerian queer feminist discourse\nwhen it can be used to demonstrate the actual constructedness of\ngender, or its lack of ontological necessity, but also that some trans\nidentity is portrayed as problematically essentialist when accompanied\nby claims to “really be” a man or a woman and/or demands\nfor medical transition (Valentine 2012). While Prosser and Rubin both\ncritique this rejection of claims to gender realness from a\nphenomenological perspective (and Prosser (1998) from a psychoanalytic\nframework as well), Namaste (1996) focuses on the institutional\nreality of gender that is often sidelined in these debates. In\nresponse, Jack Halberstam has argued that, while Prosser’s\nfrustration with a selective use of trans identity in queer and\nfeminist theory is understandable, there are still significant\nproblems with the normativity inherent in the idea of gendered\nrealness (2005). \nNotably, the proliferation of non-trans feminist writers working on\ntrans issues in the 1990s led to Jacob Hale’s “Suggested\nRules for Non-Transsexuals Writing about Transsexuals, Transsexuality,\nTranssexualism, or Trans” (1997\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n Significant non-trans feminist analyses, following Hale and the\nemergence of transgender studies, include work by Cressida Heyes\n(2003) and Naomi Scheman (1996, 2016), both of whom articulate\ntheoretical bases for solidarity between cis and trans feminists.\nThere are also important instances of cis feminist theorists bringing\ntrans issues directly into their own work as serious interlocutors,\nrather than as thought experiments (Ahmed 2016b; Colebrook 2015;\nShotwell & Sangrey 2008) and collaborating with trans theorists\n(Heyes & Latham 2018). The term “cis” itself has also\nreceived more scholarly attention in the last two decades (Aultman\n2014). While the original intention behind the term was to\ndenaturalize non-trans subject positions, not all scholars agree that\nthe term successfully destabilizes gender norms, particularly insofar\nas such norms are racialized (Enke 2012b). \nMore recently, there have been many new trajectories established at\nthe crossroads of Continental and trans approaches to gender. A number\nof philosophers have written at the intersections of phenomenology and\ntrans studies, particularly in critical phenomenology, which\nemphasizes questions of oppression and power in examining how things\nappear to us in the world (Weiss, Murphy, & Salamon 2020). Ephraim\nDas Janssen uses phenomenology, including the work of Martin\nHeidegger, to examine what transgender experience tells us about\ngender (2017). Megan Burke (2019) takes up Beauvoirian concepts to\nexplore androgyny, trans identity, and agender experience. Gayle\nSalamon draws on the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to develop a\nphenomenology of transphobia in The Life and Death of Latisha\nKing (2018a). Salamon merges a tradition of earlier work in\nphenomenology and trans studies (H. Rubin 1998; Prosser 1998) with\ncritical phenomenology. Tamsin Kimoto (2018) has also used both\nMerleau-Ponty and Frantz Fanon to explore hormonal transition and\ntransphobia. \nAlong similar lines, new work in psychoanalysis and trans studies is\nalso revising longstanding psychoanalytic approaches to sex and\ngender, including coercive and pathologizing theories of trans\nsubjectivity (Elliot 2014), and is using resources in psychoanalysis\nto theorize trans experiences from a less pathologizing perspective\n(Breslow 2017; Carlson 2010; Coffman 2017; Cavanagh 2010). For\nexample, Amy Ray Stewart uses Julia Kristeva’s concept of\n“intimate revolt” to illuminate trans and queer\nexperiences of psychic life (2017). Patricia Gherovici (2017) has\nwritten about trans phenomena and the need to revise psychoanalytic\nconcepts using Lacanian theory and her own clinical experience working\nwith trans people. Relying on both psychoanalytic and phenomenological\nframeworks, Salamon (2010a) has also defended Butler’s account\nof gender against the aforementioned critiques of its treatment of\ntrans experience and developed her own psychoanalytic and\nphenomenological account of a dissonance between a felt sense of\ngender and an external appearance of a body that is attuned to trans\nexperience. \nThere is also a body of work emerging that puts foundational figures\nin Continental feminism into conversation with trans studies. Marie\nDraz (2018) has placed feminist philosophical uses of Nietzsche, such\nas in the work of Butler (1990) and Rosalyn Diprose (2002), into\nconversation with trans scholarship on the institutionalization of\ngender categories, while Tim Johnston (2015) has argued that although\nscholars of gender and sexuality have used Irigarayan resources for\ndiscussing trans and queer issues, Irigaray’s own claim that\nontology is sexed and that there is an impassable limit between the\nsexes conveys an unsalvageable cissexism, or privileging of non-trans\nexperience. In a similar vein, Oli Stephano (2019) critiques Elizabeth\nGrosz’s emphasis on the irreducibility of sexual difference,\nshowing that her ontology invalidates trans embodiment and\nsubjectivities. This critique of Grosz follows earlier work by Eva\nHayward (2017) on the transphobic implications of some of\nGrosz’s feminist materialist arguments. Gayle Salamon also\ncritically examines the way that sexual difference operates as a limit\nto the reimagining of embodiment and materiality in the work of both\nIrigaray and Grosz (Salamon 2010a). María Lugones is another\nfigure of widespread use in Continental feminism who has been\nregularly cited in scholarship on trans issues (Bettcher 2014b;\nDiPietro 2019; Draz 2017a; Malatino 2019). Finally, like Butler, the\nuse of Foucault in trans studies has also changed dramatically over\nthe last several decades. For example, Foucault’s work on types\nof modern power has been used (alongside women of color feminism,\nindigenous scholarship, and numerous other sources) to examine the\nviolence caused by how state institutions administer legal gender\ncategories in sex-segregated institutions and identity documents\n(Spade 2011 [2015]). Foucauldian feminist accounts of prison and\npunishment have also been put into conversation with scholarship\nrooted in trans and gender non-conforming experience (Dilts 2017;\nVitulli 2018; Zurn 2016, 2019). \nTrans studies continues, in different veins, many of the foundational\nquestions of Continental feminism by bringing the tools of Continental\nphilosophy to bear on questions of sex, gender, and sexuality, and\nvice versa, and it continually orients these conversations in new\ndirections. Much of this work is informed by other areas of critical\ntheory (e.g., critical race theory and decolonial theory) and pushes\nthe traditional boundaries of Continental feminism. Recent scholarship\non blackness and trans history, for example, has articulated the\nimportance of developing frameworks capable of understanding the\ndimensions of racialized gender historically and today (Snorton 2017)\nand work on migration and Latinx trans people has highlighted the need\nto attend to both the limits of our political theory and the\nproductive capacities of trans people of color for generating new\nworlds (Pitts 2018). Current conversations about the relationship\nbetween Continental feminism and trans studies must also involve\nattention to the material conditions of the academy itself, as the\ngrowing attention to trans experience in philosophy more broadly has\nnot resulted in more trans voices and trans academics (Bettcher 2018\n(Other Internet Resources); Marvin 2019, 2020). Future directions in\nContinental feminism and trans studies will need to be attentive not\nonly to the intriguing philosophical questions occurring in these\nconversations, but also to the specific contours of the material\nconditions that allow trans scholarship to flourish. \nThis section explores the relationship between Continental feminism\nand Asian American feminist thought, both the tensions between the two\nas well as new directions that this relation brings to Continental\nfeminism. A major point of convergence between the two fields is the\nfocus on lived experience of Asian American women. This section begins\nby discussing the hypervisibility that Asian American women experience\ndue to the specific forms of oppression that they face, namely,\norientalization and the Model Minority myth. It then highlights the\nparadoxical form of invisibility that Asian American feminist\nphenomenologist trace in their body of work. Next, this section\nconsiders the historical position of Asian American women in\ncoalitional feminist projects, especially focusing on the ways in\nwhich Asian American women have been relegated to a\n“tag-along” group. Finally, this section will highlight\nrecent scholarship in Continental feminism that engages with Asian\nAmerican feminist theory and draws upon both Eastern and Western\ntraditions. \nIt must be noted from the outset that “Asian” is an\nexceptionally broad term, and the peoples that are considered\nAsian/Asian American have often changed throughout history. In\naccordance with anthologies by Asian American women that respond to\nthis very issue, this section addresses the identities of women who\ntrace their roots back to East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian\nsubcontinent (Asian Women United of California 1989; The Women of\nSouth Asian Descent Collective 1993). \nIn This Bridge Called My Back (Moraga & Anzaldúa\n1981 [2015]), Asian American thinkers such as Genny Lim, Merle Woo, Nellie\nWong, and Mitsuye Yamada established their positions in feminist\ntheorizing by exploring their own perspectives on topics surrounding\ngendered identity, sexuality, silencing, the feeling of not-belonging,\nand living against stereotypes of Asian American women as docile,\nquiet, agreeable, and submissive. Similarly, in This Bridge We\nCall Home (Anzaldúa & Keating 2002), Minh-ha T. Pham,\nShirley Geok-Lin Lim, and Jid Lee theorize from the specific\nexperiences that they face as Asian American immigrant women, such as\nexploring a connection to an Asian mother who emigrated to the United\nStates, navigating the cultural connection they still hold to a land\nthat they may have never visited, and living in the face of the Model\nMinority myth while also subverting the stereotype. Writings that\ncenter the perspective of the Asian American and diasporic Asian woman\nare essential for Asian American feminist theorizing, for, as Sonia\nShah emphasized, \n[a]n Asian American feminist movement is the only movement\nthat will consistently represent Asian American women’s\ninterests. (1998: xix) \nTwo early anthologies were very important for the formation of Asian\nAmerican feminism: Making Waves (Asian Women United of\nCalifornia [AWUC] 1989) and The Forbidden Stitch (Lim &\nTsutakawa 1989); they both include writings from different ethnic and\nnational backgrounds, specifically Chinese, Japanese, Filipino,\nKorean, Vietnamese, and Indian (Hill-Collins & Bilge 2016: 73). In\na recent volume entitled Asian American Feminisms and Women of\nColor Politics, editors Lynn Fujiwara and Shireen Roshanravan\npresent a series of articles emerging at the intersection of Asian\nAmerican feminist engagement with Women of Color coalition politics,\norganizing around concepts, methods, and epistemic principles central\nto Women of Color feminist scholarship (Fujiwara & Roshanravan\n2018) \nHypervisibility of Asian American women is a central issue in most\nAsian American feminist projects. Some Asian American feminist\ntheorists, such as Robin Zheng, argue that Asian American women are\nhypervisible because they are hypersexualized, orientalized, and\nexoticized. Robin Zheng (2016) discusses the complexities of\nhypervisibility “Why Yellow Fever Isn’t Flattering: A Case\nAgainst Racial Fetishes”. Zheng argues that there is little\ndifference between what is known as “yellow fever”, the\nracial fetishization and preference of Asian women and men, and what\nshe calls the “Mere Preference Argument”, which attempts\nto claim that there is nothing morally wrong with preferring certain\nracialized phenotypic traits; as she shows, despite the origin of a\nracialized fetish, both yellow fever and other racialized fetishes\n“depersonalize and otherize” their subjects (2016: 412).\nZheng shows that these fetishes are not just harmless personal\npreferences, but a set of practices and thought patterns that result\nin negative social impacts for Asian American women. Relatedly, Asian\nAmerican women are also hypervisible due to the “Model Minority\nmyth”, that is, the myth that asserts that Asian Americans are\nuniquely hard-working and thus, the ideal “model”\nminority, especially in contrast with other minority groups. This myth\nmakes Asian American women hypervisible by making them a part of a\ngroup of people who are defined by their ability to achieve upward\nclass mobility (K. Lee 2014). \nParadoxically, Asian American women are also rendered invisible in\nvarious feminist movements and discourses. Asian American feminist\ndiscussions on invisibility differ from other discussions within\nContinental feminism on visibility and feminine erasure due to their\ndual existence as both invisible subjects and hypervisible\nrepresentations of stereotypes. Poet and activist Mitsuye Yamada\nstates that Asian American women are “the visible minority that\nis invisible” (1981b). Yamada means this claim in two ways:\nfirst, in regard to how Asian American women are rendered invisible in\nconversations surrounding women of color oppressions; and second, in\nregard to how the oppressions experienced by Asian American women are\noften invisible to themselves. In order to carve out a space for\nthemselves in feminist theorizing, Asian American women in this book\nshared their stories that demonstrate the struggle of becoming visible\nto oneself while existing in a world that constantly demands\none’s invisibility. Yamada’s explains how she was\ninvisible to herself because she practiced passive resistance while\nbelieving that others did not see her as the stereotype of an Asian\nAmerican women. In order to become visible to herself and others, she\nrealized that she must act in ways, such as displaying anger in\nresponse to sexist and racist acts, that an oppressive gaze would\nclaim was “uncharacteristic” of her as an Asian American\nwoman (1981b: 40). At the same time, the Model Minority myth can also\nparadoxically render Asian American women invisible by making them\nhypervisible as successful paradigms that are perceived as lacking\nexperiences of oppression and violence and thus have no credibility to\nspeak to these lived experiences. \nAs a result of this specific form of invisibility, Asian American\nfeminists proposed new methods of political organization in order to\ninclude the voices of Asian American women in feminist coalitions. The\nsimilarities between writings that span nearly two decades gesture to\none of the many issues faced by Asian American feminism: Asian\nAmerican feminists have often been seen, and arguably still are seen,\nas a group in the background that is simply, as Yamada described,\n“tagging along” in feminist theorization against\noppressions (1981b: 40). In other words, Asian American women are\noften seen as individuals who do not often experience oppressions that\nare specific to their own identities and, therefore, have no place in\nfighting oppression. In response to this, we can see activists such as\nGrace Lee Boggs, who have worked closely with other people of color in\nthe fight against different oppressions (Boggs & Boggs 1974; 1998\n[2016]; Boggs & Kurashige 2011); Lisa Lowe’s essay on\nheterogeneity, hybridity, and multipolicy of Asian American\nwomen’s experiences (Lowe 1991); and more recent Asian American\nfeminist projects that include Asian Americans women in liberatory\nprojects in a manner that does not simply relegate them to tag-along\npositions (Shah 1998; Fujiwara & Roshanravan, 2018). \nA growing number of recent works in Asian American feminism engage\nwith figures and themes in Continental feminism through the framework\nEastern philosophy and the Asian American women’s perspective\nand as such they provide new directions for a genuinely\ntransContinental feminism. For example, building on the discussions\nconcerning gender in Continental feminisms, thinkers such as Kyoo Lee\n(2014) and Robin Wang (2016) have explored different ways that the\ngendered body has been discussed. Engaging with the concept of the\n“dark female animal” (xuapin) in\nDaodejing, Kyoo Lee explores the revolutionary potential of\nxuapin, which she claims possesses a gender-bending power.\nLee argues that xuapin demonstrates \nin a sense, superiority of femaleness and femininity –as\nthe norm, albeit invisible and inaudible \nand that it is \ngender-bending: female and not female at once, heterosexualized and\nnot at once. (K. Lee 2014: 59) \nWang investigates yin-yang gender dynamics through a variety of both\nEastern and Western sources in order to answer whether yin-yang gender\nconstruction allows for gender equality. Alluding to Continental\nfeminists who wrote on gender such as Simone de Beauvoir, Judith\nButler, and Luce Irigaray, Wang discusses an exploration of gender\nthrough a Chinese framework (the yin-yang) that does not make a clear\ndistinction between sex and gender. Wang argues that yin-yang gender\nconstruction offers a dynamic and fluid description of gender\nrelationships (Wang 2016: 224). \nThis entry has listed a number of ways in which Continental approaches\nand figures are used to address feminist issues; we have attempted\nboth to describe some of the ongoing research areas in Continental\nfeminism and to point out new directions it has been taking over the\npast decades. However, this list remains incomplete as we have been\nunable to account for all of the important work underway. A more\ncomplete entry would need to include projects on the intersection\nbetween Continental feminism and critical disability studies,\nindigenous feminisms, and new materialisms and humanisms. Furthermore,\nwe do not mean to suggest that there is no overlap or intersection\nbetween the topics or figures grouped under each section heading here.\nLastly, there is certainly ongoing work of which we are not aware that\nis already making an impact on the present and future of feminist\nscholarship. We thus conclude here not with a summative statement\ndefining Continental feminism but rather by reflecting on the material\nconditions of Continental feminism. \nWhen Linda Martín Alcoff addressed the Eastern American\nPhilosophical Association in 2012, she reflected on the tension and\nissues within disciplinary philosophy and urged philosophers to\n“apply our diagnostic impulses to ourselves” (Alcoff 2013:\n43). A necessary aspect of such praxis for Continental feminists in\nlight of the genealogies considered here is exemplified by Audre Lorde\nwho, speaking on the “Personal is Political Panel” at the\nSecond Sex Conference in 1979, stated \nI urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of\nknowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any\ndifference that lives there. See whose face it wears. (Lorde 1984a:\n101) \nLorde calls feminists to enact a humble and frank confrontation with\ntheir own embodied lives and senses of self in the context of each\nperson’s differential implication in racist, sexist,\nheterosexist, classist and ableist power. Rather than imagining that\none puts on one’s thinking hat and reflects “as a\ntheorist” and then take it off and acts “as a regular\nperson”, Continental feminisms suggest that the subject who\ntheorizes is themself always an embodied subject: Kris Sealey reminds\nus that “Continental methods oftentimes refract differently\nacross race and gender axes” and that for this reason,\nContinental feminists ought “to be intentional about the\nrelationship they occupy, quite simultaneously, to racial and gender\nliberation” (Sealey 2017: 166). As this entry has shown, the\ndiversity of Continental feminist thought has been developed through\nthe thoughtful negotiation of many different struggles. For the\nimagined community of Continental feminism to continue to grow and\nsupport these projects, space must continually be made for new\npractitioners. Since, as we put above, Continental feminism is less\nconcerned with changing a woman’s place in a symbolic or social\nsystem, and more on upending that system itself, members of this\nacademic community must continue to do the work that will make it\npossible to learn from each other. Only in this way Continental\nfeminism can be opened up fully to its interdisciplinary\npotential.","contact.mail":"eislekel@fordham.edu","contact.domain":"fordham.edu"},{"date.published":"2020-11-10","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/femapproach-continental/","author1":"Dilek Huseyinzadegan","author2":"Jana McAuliffe","entry":"femapproach-continental","body.text":"\n\n\n\n\n[Editor’s Note: The following new entry replaces the\n former entry\n on this topic by the previous author.]\n\n\n\n\nContinental feminism denotes an approach to feminist issues in\nphilosophy and the world both via figures and methods of what\nis called the “Continental” tradition in philosophy\nand via critical interventions into this tradition.\nContinental tradition in philosophy today refers to a set of\nnineteenth and twentieth century figures and theoretical traditions\nfrom mainland Europe, arising as a way for English-speaking\nphilosophers in the United States to distinguish their approach to\nphilosophical questions from that of the analytic tradition. By\nutilizing one or more of the signature schemas of the Continental\ntradition, Continental feminists contribute to problem areas ranging\nfrom metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, and social and\npolitical philosophy. Continental feminism thus refers to a body and\nstyle of work consisting of feminist interpretations of mainstream\nContinental figures (largely from what is called “Continental\nEurope”, such as Hegel, Levinas, Derrida, Foucault); feminist\nuses of psychoanalysis, phenomenology, deconstruction, genealogy, and\ncritical theory; and of interpretations of European feminists and\nfigures such as de Beauvoir, Irigaray, Arendt, and Kristeva. Note,\nhowever, that Europe is not and has never been a continent, and in\nthis sense, Continental feminism, like Continental philosophy, is more\nof an imagined community of approaches, figures, and traditions, or an\numbrella concept, rather than a precise term.\n\n\nElaine Miller points out that the term “Continental\nfeminism” came into circulation in the United States in 2007\n(Miller 2017); as she defines it, Continental feminism\n\n\n\n\ninvolves a commitment to the historicity of philosophical concepts,\nincluding the sometimes-uncomfortable contexts of their production, a\nbelief that it is through the examination of texts that the genealogy\nof ideas can be traced and resources for critically responding to them\ncan be formulated, and that the “canon” is subject to\nconstant re-interrogation and reconfiguration. (Miller 2017: 154)\n\n\n\nIn Allison Stone’s terms,\n\n\n\n\ndescribing the world as it really is—not as an aggregate of\nstatic items but as an ever-shifting web of relations—calls for\nunfamiliar, difficult language. (Stone 2015: 4)\n\n\n\nA distinguishing feature of Continental feminism, Miller and Stone\nagree, is that it\n\n\n\n\nembodies a refusal to prima facie privilege clarity and\nsuccinctness of argument over acknowledging through language the\ncomplexity, difficulty, and problematic nature of the issues being\naddressed. (Miller 2017: 154; Stone 2015: 2)\n\n\n\nAs a way of beginning to address the Euro- and U.S.-centric biases of\ncontinental philosophy, a transContinental turn in Continental\nfeminism proposed by Kyoo Lee and Alyson Cole aims to incorporate a\nglobal view of feminist issues and theories, where\n\n\n\n\n“trans” serves as a marker for the constant geo-cultural\nflows of ideas in transit, as in “transatlantic”,\n“transpacific”, “transoceanic”, etc., as well\nas for cutting-edge works, conversations, and debates in\ntrans-critical, cultural, disciplinary, human, gender, genic, lingual,\nmedial, national fields, etc., and as trans*feminist discourses. (Cole\nand Lee 2019: iv)\n\n\n\nAccordingly, this entry will take Continental feminism to include the\nfollowing distinct yet related set of issues and areas: (1) the\nfeminist use of figures, traditions, and approaches of\nphenomenology/existentialism, psychoanalysis, post-structuralism\n(deconstruction and genealogy), and critical theory; (2) critical\ninterventions into the assumptions about sex, gender, class, race,\nability, religion, and age endemic to European philosophy; and (3)\ninterpretations of hitherto underrepresented figures and methods of\nfeminism from a transContinental and transAtlantic perspective that\nestablish new, abandoned, or previously delegitimated genealogies for\nfeminist thought.\n\n\nIt is important to note that not all Continental feminists are\nphilosophers or work in Philosophy departments; thus, Continental\nfeminism is interdisciplinary and its practitioners come from various\nfields. As this subfield developed in the early 2000s, there were\nalready disciplinary, intra-disciplinary and extra-disciplinary\nprojects that explored feminist issues by utilizing phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, deconstructive, and critical theoretical approaches.\nRather than organizing this entry around the signature schemas of the\nContinental tradition and subsuming ongoing work that uses these\napproaches under them, this entry will locate crucial genealogies for\nContinental feminism in the work of Black feminists, post- and\ndecolonial feminists, women of color feminists, Asian American\nfeminists, trans feminists, and queer feminists. We take these\ngenealogies as central to the past, present, and future of Continental\nfeminism, and accordingly this entry is organized topically, in order\nto outline the ways that Continental feminisms have developed in\nconversation and in tension with these interdisciplinary projects.\nThese projects have been unearthing the cissexist,\nsexist/misogynistic, racist, heterosexist, classist, ageist, ableist,\ncolonial commitments of philosophy as a discipline and a professional\nfield as they are simultaneously expanding, transforming, and pushing\nthe concerns and methods of Continental thought in interdisciplinary\niterations. Indeed, what distinguishes Continental feminism clearly\nfrom Analytic feminism are its call for interdisciplinarity and its\nbelief that feminist omissions themselves can become sites from which\nnew projects are launched, as will be highlighted throughout this\nentry. As such, Continental feminism starts with the premise that\nEuropean or Anglo-American norms and categories of thought can be\ninterpreted, critiqued, and re-envisioned or abandoned for feminist\npurposes.\n\nContinental feminists share with other Continental thinkers an\ninterest in close reading that uses careful exegesis to unpack the\ndeep meanings of texts through attention to their linguistic and\nhistorical specificity. However, to utilize a philosophical tradition\nthat has largely presumed rather than explored the impacts of sex and\ngender on material life, continental feminists often read irreverently\nto focus on concerns that traditional philosophy might push to the\nside. While all feminist theorizing deals with questions of power,\nsubjectivity, and culture, Continental feminist approaches to these\nissues are often critical in the sense that they explore how\nexternal power dynamics affect the constitution of inner experiences,\nand in turn how embodied and subjective re-articulations of power can\nand should transform the world in the pursuit of justice. This\nfrequently involves taking lived experience as a crucial component of\ncritical philosophy; as Gail Weiss puts it, \nonly by interrogating the “ordinary” dimensions of\nexperience is it possible to arrive at an understanding of the dynamic\nforces that give meaning to individual lives and that are both the\nobstacle and the vehicle to achieving lasting social change. (Weiss\n2008: 5) \nTo present a broad sketch of characteristics of continental feminism\nthroughout its history, this section focuses on methods that\nContinental feminists use to engage embodied experience in their\nprojects. The gendered critique of the traditional Western\nphilosophical tendency to dichotomize the body that feels and the mind\nthat thinks is an ongoing theme in continental feminism (see entry on\n feminist perspectives on the body).\n The account presented here is not at all complete, as the specific\naims and methods of such feminist projects differ widely, most\nimportantly in terms of how an analysis of sex and gender is impacted\nby other aspects of embodied experience such as race, sexuality, and\nability. This section first addresses some ways that continental\nfeminists trouble a mind-body distinction by engaging affect and\nemotion in their work. Next, it explores two examples of how\ncontinental traditions, psychoanalysis and phenomenology, are made\ninto critical resources in Continental feminist projects. Finally, it\npresents work that engages an ongoing critique of culture and everyday\nexperience as an important aspect of feminist theorizing. \nMany Continental feminists focus on the overlaying of mental and\nphysical experience via the concepts of affect, emotion, and feeling.\nAffect is described by Teresa Brennan as “the physiological\nshift accompanying a judgment” (Brennan 2004: 5). The\n“transmission of affect” describes the way that one can\ncatch the mood of another; this experience is “social in origin\nbut biological and physical in effect” (Brennan 2004: 3).\nBrennan describes transmission as when the “emotions or\naffects of one person, and the enhancing or depressing energies these\naffects entail” pass from one person to another (Brennan 2004:\n3). Affect is thus one way to describe how social experience impacts\nthe corporeal life of subjects through the transference of energy. In\nBrennan’s case, affective states are directional; they\nare not neutral but push or press on subjects. At the same time, terms\nlike affect and feeling might be distinguished based on the extent to\nwhich one considers affect to be already coded with or influenced by\nsocial significance for a subject (see Ahmed 2010: 230–231,\nSeigworth & Gregg 2010, esp. 5–8). \nContinental feminist projects on emotion often analyze historically\ncontextualized experiences. Ann Cvetkovich engages with trauma in a\nway that \nfocuses on the everyday and the insidious…and situates it in a\nsocial and cultural frame rather than a medical one. (Cvetkovich 2007:\n464) \nShe then presents a political account of depression that\ndepathologizes such negatively-connotated emotional experiences so\nthat they can become more visible in public and thus create a\npotential foundation for community (Cvetkovich 2007: 460). In The\nCultural Politics of Emotion, Sara Ahmed argues that emotion is\ngenerated when meaning is produced across social-political\ninteraction; these feelings create the boundaries of affinity groups\nand impact self-understanding. In this analysis, emotions help\nconstitute what a person understands as their objective condition, and\nthus \nemotions are not “in” either the individual or the social,\nbut produce the very surfaces and boundaries that allow all kinds of\nobjects to be delineated. (Ahmed 2004 [2014: 10]) \nBecause feeling is often ambivalent and multi-faceted, rather than in\nspite of this complexity, social critics who attend to how affects are\nemployed and manipulated in both textual and social-political\nargumentation can produce readings that trouble an easy dichotomy\nbetween what is a “good” and what a “bad”\nexperience. \nPsychoanalytically-informed projects use concepts such as trauma,\nmourning, melancholia, and abjection to analyze embodied experience\n(Irigaray 1974 [1985]; Spillers 1996; Butler 1997; Felman 2002; Oliver\n2004; entry on\n psychoanalytic feminism).\n They frequently engage aesthetics as an aspect of social critique\n(Chanter 2008; Kristeva 1980 [1982]; Miller 2014). This allows a\nsymptomatic reading of feeling to be interpreted back against the\nsocial order, as is seen in Judith Butler’s Frames of\nWar. In this text, Butler analyzes what makes a life grievable\nand argues that the questions of who appears as a human, whose life\nshould be protected, and who does not are all figured in advance of\nany particular political decision through a pre-reflexive manipulation\nof affect (Butler 2009 [2016: 64]). Supplementing democratic theory\nwith Continental feminist interpretations, Noëlle McAfee deploys\nKristeva and the resources in her thought, as well as psychoanalysis,\nspecifically on the issues of affect and the notion of the\n“political unconscious” (McAfee 2000 and 2008). \nCritical phenomenologists draw on the methods of phenomenology to\ndemonstrate “the multiple ways in which power moves through our\nbodies and our lives” (Introduction, Weiss, Murphy, &\nSalamon 2020: xiv). Lisa Guenther understands critical phenomenology\nas both a way of doing philosophy and a way of approaching political\nactivism (Guenther 2020: 15). Most characteristically, Guenther argues\nthat critical phenomenology employs reworked versions of \nMerleau-Ponty’s concept of the body schema to account for\ngendered and sexual schemas (Simone de Beauvoir, Iris Marion Young,\nTalia Mae Bettcher, Gayle Salamon), racialized schemas (Frantz Fanon,\nLewis Gordon, Sara Ahmed, George Yancy, Alia Al-Saji), disability\nschemas (Kay Toombs, Lisa Diedrich, Havi Carel), and other aspects of\nlived experience. (Guenther 2020: 13–14) \nA recent volume edited by Gail Weiss, Ann V, Murphy, and Gayle\nSalamon, entitled 50 Concepts for a Critical* Phenomenology\n(2020), shows that many of the central concepts of critical\nphenomenology intersect with Continental feminism. \nFinally, considering the social and political import of inner states\nand the centering of quotidian experiences of power enable Continental\nfeminists to explore culture as it develops. For instance, Shannon\nSullivan’s Good White People: The Problem with Middle-Class\nAnti-Racism focuses on “the personal side of whiteness and\nwhite privilege” with attention to the embodied experience of\nrace (S. Sullivan 2014: 19) to critique the ways through which white\nliberals set themselves up as altruistic, “good” white\npeople through, e.g., hypocritical modes of tolerance that maintain\nwhite domination (S. Sullivan 2014: 4). Robin James’\nResilience & Melancholy explores pop music as a way to\nanalyze the impact of neoliberal biopolitics; she combines music\ntheory with psychoanalytic and Foucauldian philosophies to critique\ncomplicity with multi-racial white supremacist patriarchy and argues\nthat music, e.g., Rihanna’s, offer strategies for countering\nthis oppressive power (R. James 2015). In Irony in the Age of\nEmpire: Comic Perspectives on Philosophy and Freedom, Cynthia\nWillett engages film and stand-up comedy to articulate a libidinal\nunderstanding of freedom that can counter the liberal paradigms of\nindividuality with a sense of freedom defined “in terms of\nequality and solidarity” (Willett 2008: 14). Erin Tarver\nanalyzes practices of sports fans, with particular attention to\nfootball, baseball, and basketball fans in the American South, to\nbetter understand how individual and group identities are maintained\nto “…shore up, reproduce, and very occasionally, subvert\nracial, sexual and gender hierarchies” (Tarver 2017: 3). This\nwork is often interdisciplinary, and some of these projects work at\nthe intersection between continental and pragmatist feminisms (see\nentry on\n intersections between pragmatist and continental feminism). \nSimultaneously reading carefully and irreverently, continental\nfeminists deepen the philosophical account of experience by\nintegrating historically contextualized feeling into their projects,\nusing and transmuting philosophical traditions and traditional\nfigures, and interrogating everyday experiences in their embodied and\ncultural specificity. This work insists that meaning and social order\nfunction through unrecognized cooptation, subordination or exclusion\nin various intersectional constellations. In general, continental\nfeminisms are less concerned with changing a woman’s place in a\nsymbolic or social system, and more focused on upending such systems,\nas will be explored in more detail in the following sections. \nThis section on the convergences between Black and Continental\nfeminist thought begins with a discussion about the history of Black\nfeminist scholarship utilizing existential/phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, critical, and hermeneutic approaches. It then\nintroduces intersectionality as the major heuristic for Black feminist\ntheorizing, and concludes by highlighting emerging areas and\nintersections between Black studies and Black feminist Continental\nthought. \nBlack women have long been contributors to the Continental\nphilosophical tradition. One may argue that their contributions to\nprofessional philosophy started after the graduation of the first\nBlack woman to earn the PhD in philosophy, Joyce Mitchell Cook, who\ncompleted the degree in 1965 from Princeton University. Even prior to\nthis date, however, Black women engaged in projects that we can\nrecognize as Continental feminist projects. Importantly, \nmany Black intellectuals in the United States going back (at least) to\nthe nineteenth century offered what are now described as existential,\nphenomenological, and/or genealogical analyses of race and racism.\n(Belle 2012, 329 fn. 1) \nThese contributions did not always occur in the form of traditional\nphilosophical discussions, nor are they always created by those who\nhave professional degrees in philosophy, which is certainly true of\nthe nineteenth and early twentieth century thinkers, Sojourner Truth,\nMaria W. Stewart, and\n Anna Julia Cooper. \nBlack feminists’ contributions to Continental philosophy\ndemonstrate the ways in which their voices are crucial to both shaping\nand expanding the discipline. Kathryn Sophia Belle, Donna-Dale\nMarcano, and Maria del Guadalupe Davidson edited Convergences:\nBlack Feminism and Continental Philosophy (del Guadalupe et al.\n2010), the only text at the publication of this entry that addresses\nboth these topics simultaneously. For the editors, the concept of\nconvergence is demonstrated by the natural, historical, and necessary\nengagement of Black women with Continental philosophy. Belle\nwrites, \nBlack feminist and womanist thinkers inevitably address the very same\nissues of agency, identity, alienation, power, and so on that are\nraised in much recent Continental philosophy. Likewise, from Immanuel\nKant to the feminist thinkers of the present, Continental philosophy\nhas engaged, to some extent, with issues of race and gender. (2010:\n5) \nThe Black feminist tradition in Continental philosophy demonstrates\nthat Black women are not strangers nor enemies of Continental\nphilosophy; rather, their unique theoretical positioning affords them\nthe opportunity to utilize, challenge, and expand the tradition. \nBlack feminist thinkers contribute to Continental feminist thought in\nat least two ways. First, they engage directly with Continental\nfigures and theories. For example, Lorraine Hansberry comments that\nSimone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex (1949, translated\nin 1953) was arguably the “most important work of this\ncentury” (1957 [1995: 129 and 133]), and Antillean thinker\nPaulette Nardal draws on both features of the Harlem Renaissance and\nexistentialist thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre to provide a\nphenomenological and genealogical account of how the Black race, and\nAntilleans in particular, have come to understand their own notion of\nrace consciousness in “The Awakening of Race\nConsciousness” (1932). More recently, they engage with canonical\nfigures and ideologies of Continental philosophy, as in the work of\nKathryn Sophia Belle on Hannah Arendt (2014) or Kris Sealey on\nEmmanuel Levinas (2014). Second, regardless of their professional\nPhilosophy degrees or lack thereof, Black feminist thinkers utilize\nthe tools of the Continental tradition as part of their\ninterdisciplinary approaches, as in the use of Foucault in the work of\nSylvia Wynter (2003) and the use of Freud, Lacan, and psychoanalysis\nin the work of Hortense Spillers (1996). \nBlack feminist thinkers have frequently used intersectionality as an\neffective entry-point into conversations with the Continental\ntradition. Intersectionality is a Black feminist theory that describes\nthe oppression that Black women experience as a result of lying at the\nnexus of simultaneously impactful identities, such as that of race,\ngender, class, and sexuality. As such, intersectionality can be used\nas a phenomenological tool to describe Black women’s lived\nexperience of oppression. While legal theorist Kimberlé\nCrenshaw coined the term in 1989, the theory has been articulated at\nleast since the mid-nineteenth century in Sojourner Truth’s\nproclamation, “Ain’t I a Woman?” (1851). In the\nspeech, Truth highlights that Black women are treated with less\nrespect than white women while bearing the same burdens of racism as\nBlack men. Anna Julia Cooper wrote that Black women are \nconfronted by a both a woman question and a race problem and is as yet\nan unknown or an unacknowledged factor in both. (1892 [1988: 134]) \nIn their collective statement from April 1977, The Combahee River\nCollective argues that \nBlack feminism [is] the logical political movement to combat the\nmanifold and simultaneous oppressions that all women of color face \nand that \n[t]here is also undeniably a personal genesis for Black feminism, that\nis, the political realization that comes from the seemingly personal\nexperiences of individual Black women’s lives. (Taylor 2017: 15\nand 17) \nIntersectionality is thus a hallmark of Black feminist thought because\nit prioritizes the lived experiences of Black women. In doing so, it\nsupplies the tools to think about the extent to which one’s\nconsciousness the world is informed by experiences of racism, sexism,\nclassism, and homophobia. \nIn addition to its utility in explaining Black women’s lived\nexperience, intersectionality also provides tools for Black feminists\nto critique the presumed whiteness and bourgeois-class status of\nfeminism and to combat various forms of oppression and violence. Thus,\nintersectionality is also key to critiquing phenomenological analysis,\nthat is, analysis of lived experiences and feminist movements through\nthe lens of sociopolitical identities such as race, sex, and class.\nAngela Davis’s text Women, Race, & Class (1981) is\nan early model of this approach; it details the history of U.S.\nwomen’s movements and their consideration, or lack thereof, of\nthe class-based and racial dimensions of womanhood. Texts such as\nPatricia Hill-Collins’s Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge,\nConsciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment (1990 [2015]) underscore\nthe ways in which Black women create their own epistemological\nstandpoint as a result of their lived experiences. In the 1970s to\n90s, when Black women’s contributions to academia reached its\nzenith, Black feminist scholars such as Barbara Christian in\n“The Race for Theory” (1988), Toni Morrison in Playing\nin the Dark (1992), and Audre Lorde in “The Master’s\nTools will Never Dismantle the Master’s House” (1984a) and\n“Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference”\n(1984b) exemplified Black women’s critiques of theoretical\napproaches that adopt a “neutral” stance toward feminist\nmovements where neutral meant presuming all women to be white,\nmiddle-class, young or middle-aged, and heterosexual (see also Hull,\nBell-Scott, & Smith 1982). \nCurrent Black feminist work centers Black epistemologies,\npractices, and concepts. The burgeoning scholarship of Black women\nphilosophers continue to push the boundaries of Continental feminism,\nas in the work of Lindsey Stewart’s work on Black feminist\npractices of freedom (2017), Camisha Russell’s work on the\nissues of race and gender in assisted reproduction (2018), and Axelle\nKarera’s work, which focuses on the Anthropocene and\nantiBlackness (2019). In addition to engaging with the canonical\nfigures of the Continental tradition, Black thinkers harvest\nphilosophy from their own perspective and experience of the world as\nwell as their theoretical archives. Much of this more recent work\nintersects with Black Studies. The work of Black thinkers from\ndisciplines other than philosophy are intersecting with Continental\nphilosophical and feminist approaches, as seen in the works of such as\nSaidiya Hartman (1997, 2007, and 2019), Christina Sharpe (2016),\nRizvana Bradley (2014 and 2018), Jennifer Nash (2019), Denise Ferreira\nda Silva (2007, 2014, and 2018), Riley Snorton (2017), Selamawit\nTerrefe (2020), and Zakiyyah Iman Jackson (2020). \nContinental feminist approaches to questions on colonialism revolve\naround two main sets of investigations: on the one hand, the\ninterrogation of the hegemony of the West as an abstract category that\nis deployed strategically to exclude and inferiorize communities\ndeemed Non-Western (Spivak 1999; Narayan 1997; Mohanty 1984), and on\nthe other hand, the question of coloniality, which focuses on the\npolitical and epistemic ordering of the globe starting with the\ncolonization of the Americas (Lugones 2003; Wynter 1995; Ortega 2016).\nTo this end, these approaches both use schemas of the Continental\ntradition (such as phenomenology, psychoanalysis, genealogy,\ndeconstruction, and poststructuralism) and call into question the\ngeographic and racial assumptions that underlie Continental\nphilosophy. For both of these approaches, an analysis of colonialism\nis inseparable from the political aim of challenging and undoing the\ncolonial world. This challenge entails deconstructing the categories\nof the colonially determined globe (such as East-West,\nWestern-Non-Western, Developed-Underdeveloped, First World-Third\nWorld, North-South) through focusing on the concrete lived experiences\nof individuals and communities. This section focuses on the general\ncharacteristics of these two Continental feminist approaches taken up\nunder the rough categories of postcolonial and decolonial feminisms,\nwith the former focusing on the Western-Non-western divide that marks\ncolonial relations, and the latter on the North-South dialogues that\nemerge within the relations of coloniality. It concludes by\nhighlighting coalitional thinking, a fundamental aspect of both post-\nand decolonial feminist approaches. \nPostcolonial feminist approaches maintain that in order to interrogate\nthe hegemony of the West, it is necessary to deconstruct the ways in\nwhich it is deployed to exclude the non-Western subject. Furthermore,\nsuch deployment is always a strategic one, insofar as the\n“West” is not a concrete geographical category, and the\nparadigm of Western subjectivity is continuously built by demarcating\nthose who do not fit in it. Postcolonial feminisms are\ninterdisciplinary and not limited to the field of philosophy, and they\nchallenge the inscription of the gender, racial, and geographic\ncategories that underlie the hegemony of the Western subject. In doing\nso, Continental feminist approaches engage with figures from\npoststructuralism and critical theory (such as Foucault, Derrida,\nDeleuze and Adorno), and they deploy methods such as genealogy and\ndeconstruction (Spivak 1988; Mohanty 1984), in order to question the\nunderlying geographic and gendered assumptions of these methods. In\n“Can the Subaltern Speak?” for example, Gayatri\nChakravorty Spivak engages with French poststructuralism and questions\nthe paradigms of speech/reason that deny the very possibility of\ncapacities such as resistance for those that do not fit within the\ngeographic, racialized, and gendered boundaries of Western\nSubjectivity (Spivak 1988). In doing so, she highlights the ways in\nwhich poststructuralism relies upon the very categories (of speech,\nreason, or universal subjectivity) that it ostensibly critiques. \nThe tension highlighted by Spivak, in which the Western Subject\nconstitutes both the dominant subject and the only subject capable of\nresistance, underlies postcolonial feminisms’ critique of the\nalignment of the West with modernity and progress (McClintock 1995;\nStoler 1995). Chandra Talpade Mohanty, in “Under Western\nEyes”, criticizes the hegemony of Western approaches in defining\nthe scope and goals of feminist struggles. Issues such as the veil\ndebate, in this sense, point to the political and phenomenological\nracialization of the Non-Western woman (Al-Saji 2010; Sheth 2006). At\nthe same time, Uma Narayan draws attention to the risks of fetishizing\nthe category of the Non-Western and highlights how such a\nfetishization remains within colonially determined divisions (Narayan\n1997; Narayan & Harding 2000). Namita Goswami, in Subjects\nThat Matter, develops heterogeneity as a kind of conceptual\ncontinuity between feminism, philosophy, and postcolonial studies,\nwhich allows for an understanding of difference beyond oppositional\nand antagonistic terms (Goswami 2019). \nDecolonial feminisms emerge primarily from the U.S. Latina and Latinx\ncontexts and have a different genealogy, insofar as they are in\ndialogue with Latin American Philosophy, Continental Philosophy,\nAnglo-American Thought, and especially U.S. Women of Color feminisms.\nFocusing on North-South dialogues, Latin American and Latina Feminist\nphilosophers such as Ofelia Schutte engage with the work of figures\nsuch as Nietzsche, Kristeva, and Irigaray while developing Latin\nAmerican philosophy as a field in U.S. academic philosophy (Schutte\n1984; 1993; for more, see the entry on\n Latin American feminism).\n Linda Martín Alcoff, for example, brings Latin American\nPhilosophy (particularly the work of Enrique Dussel) in dialogue with\nexistentialism and poststructuralism in order to develop the framework\nfor Latinx feminisms (Alcoff 2006, 2015). \nOne of the major frameworks of decolonial feminisms is “the\ncoloniality of power”, a term first introduced by Aníbal\nQuijano, and defined as “the social classification of the\nworld’s population around the idea of race” (Quijano 2000:\n1). In this sense, the colonization of the Americas is not only a\nhistorical moment, but also the emergence of race and the subsequent\nreorganization of the globe in accordance with what Walter Mignolo\ncalls “the colonial difference”, denoting the abstract\npositioning of Europe as the global hegemonic power (Mignolo 2002).\nDecolonial feminisms take an intersectional approach to the\ncoloniality of power and investigate, as María Lugones says,\n“the emergence of hegemonic gender arrangements along\n‘racial’ lines” starting with the colonization of\nthe Americas (Lugones 2007: 190). Decolonial feminists such as Lugones\nand Wynter bring poststructuralist critique in dialogue with Latin\nAmerican philosophy and argue that dominant gender arrangements\nthemselves are colonial; these arrangements, such as patriarchy,\nheterosexualism, or gender dimorphism mark concrete historical\nprocesses of the racial inscription of gender norms, starting from and\nwith the coloniality of power (Lugones 2008; Oyěwùmí\n2007; Wynter 2006). \nDecolonial feminisms’ emphasis on historical critique is\ninseparable from a concern with the concrete lived experiences of\nwomen of color (Moraga and Anzaldúa 1981 [2015]; Pérez\n1999; Lugones 2007, Sandoval 2000). Gloria Anzaldúa, in\nBorderlands/La Frontera, emphasizes bordered thinking as the\nunderlying logic of contemporary systems of oppression, and she\nformulates the resistances of hybrid identities that emerge both out\nof and in response to such bordered thinking (Anzaldúa 1987).\nMariana Ortega develops Latina feminist phenomenology in emphasizing\nboth the lived experience of borderlands and exile, and the\npossibilities of resistance by developing “home-tactics”\nin and through these experiences (Ortega 2016). \nCoalitional thinking is a fundamental aspect of both post- and\ndecolonial feminist approaches. Mohanty calls for coalitions across\nborders in thinking through the concrete lived experiences and\nemphasizes the importance of situated and local struggles in\nunderstanding hegemonic power relations.  Moraga and Anzaldúa,\nin their coedited collection This Bridge Called My Back, call\nfor concrete and sustained coalitions that are based on an\nintersectional understanding of women’s lives, rather than\nabstract calls for sisterhood. Decolonial feminists such as Lugones,\nChela Sandoval, Ortega, and Emma Pérez, maintain that\ncoalitional thinking cannot be an afterthought for any anti- or\ndecolonial struggles (Pérez 1999; Sandoval 2000). \nAs Continental feminism expands, it involves further conversations\nwith and in-between these approaches. The questions around the\n“continent” of Continental feminism, as well as how such a\ncontinent is situated within the colonial geographic boundaries of the\nWest and the Global North, continue to be challenged. As spaces for\nsuch a flow of ideas open up, further conversations on the possibility\nof coalition, as well as on challenging the limits of colonial thought\ncontinue to reshape the face of Continental feminism. \nThe relationship between Continental feminism and queer theory is\nsimultaneously productive and fraught. While far from exhaustive, this\nentry will first highlight some of the overlapping figures and\napproaches between the two fields, including examples of scholarship\nat their intersections. It will then briefly introduce one account of\nthe tension between them. Finally, it will close with some reflections\non the shared problems across these fields, including their\nhistorically white and Anglo-Eurocentric approaches, as well as how\nrecent work in queer of color critique aligns with and points to new\ndirections in Continental feminism. \nIn the late 1980s and the early 1990s, “queer” emerged as\na reclamation of a homophobic slur and a rallying cry for a coalition\nof the marginalized against the tyranny of the normal (Barker &\nScheele 2016; D. Hall & Jagose 2012; Warner 1993; Sedgwick 1993;\nAnzaldúa 1991 [2009]). Formed in the crucible of the AIDS\ncrisis, which sharpened the need to understand the violence\nexperienced by people excluded by norms related to gender and\nsexuality, “queer” was meant to bring attention to the\nrange of sexual/gender practices deemed outside the purview of the\nnormal. In one genealogy of queer theory, the field develops this\nearly activist reclamation of the term queer into a wide-reaching\ncritique of how norms operate in and through dominant\nconceptualizations of identity. Given this motivating impulse of\ndeconstruction, or of denaturalizing categories such as sexuality, it\nis perhaps of no surprise that queer theory has historically been a\nfield well-populated with figures (e.g., Lacan, Foucault, Derrida) and\nmethodological approaches (poststructuralism, psychoanalysis,\nphenomenology) that have been associated with Continental philosophy,\nespecially twentieth century European philosophy. \nQueer theory frequently draws on, critiques, and expands the ideas of\nmany figures and approaches that are seen as early progenitors of\nContinental feminism (e.g., Beauvoir, Irigaray, Kristeva, feminist\nphenomenology, feminist poststructuralism, critical theory,\npsychoanalytic theory). As Jagose (2009) points out, however, the\ncritique of normative identity categories was not invented by queer\ntheory, given that feminist scholarship has a rich history of\nradically disrupting the category of women along lines of race and\nsexuality. Moreover, the lines between feminism and queer theory are\nhistorically blurred. For example, Judith Butler—who is often\ncited as an originator of queer theory—explicitly marks her\nearly work as occurring in the intersection of these fields (as well\nas a number of other critical discourses) (1997). In Gender\nTrouble (1990) and Bodies that Matter (1993), Butler\ndraws on Continental feminist figures such as Irigaray, Beauvoir, and\nKristeva, and methods ranging from psychoanalysis to poststructuralism\nand phenomenology to develop a simultaneously queer and feminist\ntheoretical lens focused on understanding the relationship between\ngender and sexuality, as well as the operation of norms and identity\ncategories more broadly (Salih 2002). \nA second major figure in the relationship between Continental feminism\nand queer theory is Michel Foucault, who has been extensively used in\nboth queer and Continental (and specifically poststructuralist)\nfeminist theory, but who (as opposed to Butler) did not explicitly use\nthe terms queer and feminist. While a larger account of the connection\nbetween Foucault and queer theory is beyond the scope of this entry,\nthe relationship is a rich one. In the late 1980s, Foucault’s\nThe History of Sexuality, Volume One was read\nheavily by activists and scholars questioning dominant narratives\naround sexuality and identity (Halperin 1995); Foucault’s work\nwas also influential not only for Judith Butler’s Gender\nTrouble (1990) but also for another text often cited as\nfoundational for queer theory, Eve Sedgwick’s Epistemology\nof the Closet (1990 [2008]). \nFoucault’s genealogical approach to identity, including his\nexploration of the histories and models of power at work in modern\nconceptions of sexuality, has been important for a number of\ncontemporary scholars working at the intersections of feminism and\nqueer theory (Huffer 2010 and 2020; Russell 2010; Sawicki 2005;\nSchotten 2018; Winnubst 2006). For example, Ladelle McWhorter (1999)\ntakes up Foucault’s account of ethics as a practice of the self,\nor how we work on ourselves to become particular kinds of people,\nthrough a queer framework that resists expected developmental\ntrajectories and normative timelines of a life (e.g., heterosexual\ncoupling resulting in marriage and children). And in a different vein,\nJasbir Puar (2007) has drawn on Foucault’s theories of power (as\nwell as a wide range of interdisciplinary theory including\npostcolonial feminist theory) to analyze the relationship between\ncontemporary biopower and homonationalism, or how certain\n“good” gay and lesbian subjects, by aligning themselves\nwith U.S. imperialism, are welcomed into the nation-state. \nFigures associated with Continental feminism who do not necessarily\nmark themselves or their work as queer have also been used in queer\ntheoretical projects, just as feminists have historically done with\nany number of non-feminist philosophers. For example, queer studies\nscholars have explored the relative absence of Irigaray in queer\ntheory, argued for the queer resources of her thinking (Huffer 2013;\nWinnubst 2006), called attention to the potential use of\nIrigaray’s disruption of binaries for queer analyses of identity\n(Butler 1993: 36–39; Grosz 1989), and used Irigarayan concepts\nto develop queer analyses of longstanding feminist issues, such as the\nexperience of breast feeding (R. Lee 2018). \nPhenomenological methods can also track this traffic between\nContinental feminism and queer theory. For example, Sara Ahmed’s\nQueer Phenomenology (2006) explores the use of phenomenology\nin queer studies by asking, among other questions, how to understand\nthe “orientation” of sexual orientation as the way bodies\nare directed towards particular objects and away from others. In\ndeveloping this queer use of phenomenology, Ahmed acknowledges her\ndebt to feminist philosophers of the body such as Sandra Bartky, Iris\nMarion Young, Rosalyn Diprose, and Gail Weiss, as well as early\nphenomenologists such as de Beauvoir and phenomenologists of race\nincluding Linda Alcoff, Frantz Fanon, and Lewis Gordon. \nGiven these examples of the overlap of figures and approaches in\nContinental feminism and queer theory, it is worth asking what\ndistinguishes the approaches. One may be tempted to say that feminism\nfocuses more on gender (historically, within continental feminism,\nthis may be more commonly discussed as sexual difference) and queer\ntheory focuses more on sexuality (including questions of pleasure,\ndesire, and eroticism). Yet many working within Continental feminism,\nespecially as inflected with French theory, also focus on questions\nrelated to sexuality such as pleasure, desire, and eroticism. And\nthere are also reasons to be suspicious of how the gender-sexuality\nsplit is narrated as a feminist-queer split. While some have argued\nthat there are good reasons to draw distinctions between these fields\nin order to do justice to their distinct concerns (G. Rubin 2011;\nHalley 2006), there have also been many challenges to overly\nprogrammatic forms of this separation (Huffer 2013) and accounts of\nhow this narrative can overlook the field’s mutual interest in\nunderstanding the complex relationship between gender and sexuality,\nas well as the possibility of a queer feminism (Jagose 2009).\nNevertheless, despite the overlaps in figures and archives, as well as\nthe wealth of resources in queer theory on topics that Continental\nfeminist philosophers hold dear (temporality, embodiment, identity,\nand desire, to name only a few), the relatively slow uptake of texts\nmarked explicitly as queer theory has been noticeable (Winnubst 2010).\nThis is not to erase the important work done at the intersections of\nthese fields but to acknowledge that the relationship is not a\nseamless one. In their introductory comments to a “Roundtable on\nContinental Feminism”, Lynne Huffer and Shannon Winnubst (2017)\nnote the relative lack of engagement with queer theory among the\ncontributions, and they ask whether Continental feminism is capacious\nenough to embrace queer theory, a question that has also been posed to\nphilosophy more broadly (Ahmed 2016b; Salamon 2009; Winnubst\n2010). \nFinally, both Continental feminism and queer theory have also been\nextensively critiqued for the whiteness and Anglo-Eurocentric nature\nof their archives. In one particularly well-known rendition of this\ncritique, Cathy Cohen asks whether queer theory has lived up to its\nanti-identitarian promise of creating coalitions across difference\n(2005). As a way to intervene in the whiteness of queer theory\n(Johnson and Henderson 2005), Roderick Ferguson (2004) coined the\nterm “queer of color critique” to describe how various\nintersections of race, gender, sexuality, and class operate in\nnationalistic discourses of identity and belonging; it is, in\nFerguson’s words, \na heterogenous enterprise made up of women of color feminism,\nmaterialist analysis, poststructuralist theory, and queer critique.\n(Ferguson 2004: 149) \nOther notable and early contributors to this sub-field include\nJosé Muñoz, E. Patrick Johnson, Chandan Reddy, and\nGayatri Gopinath. Although the topics at work in queer of color\ncritique concerning identity, embodiment, temporality, and affect have\nalso been topics of central interests to Continental feminists, the\nuptake of queer of color critique, as with queer theory, has been slow\nin Continental feminism. However, as Continental feminism\nexpands—as shown through this entry— the resources of\nqueer theory and queer of color critique are waiting in the wings as\ncrucial, if at times under acknowledged, interlocutors. \nLike Continental feminism, queer theory and queer of color critique\ncontinue the longstanding feminist tradition of sending texts and\nideas in directions they were perhaps never intended to travel. Recent\ntrajectories at the crossroads of Continental feminism and queer\nstudies include attention to neoliberal capitalism (Winnubst 2015;\nMcWhorter 2012), sex and gender in ancient Greek metaphysics (Bianchi\n2014); critical disability theory (Puar 2017; K. Hall 2014; Yergeau\n2018; and Gallop 2019), Latina feminism and existential phenomenology\n(Ortega 2016), affect and temporality (Ahmed 2019; Amin 2017; Freeman\n2019), and materialism and concepts of agency (Chen 2012). As explored\nin the next section, another important interlocutor with both\nContinental feminism and queer theory is transgender studies. \nA number of scholars have noted the complex interplay of shared and\ndistinct concerns between trans, feminist, and queer frameworks\n(Namaste 1996 and 2009; Prosser 1998; Heyes 2003; Salamon 2010a;\nStryker 2004). Emerging in the 1990s as a distinct field of academic\ninquiry, trans studies shares many of the intellectual roots of queer\ntheory yet also departs from queer studies through its explicit focus\non trans experience, including both non-monolithic nature of that\nexperience and the importance of trans people speaking for themselves\nabout their own lives. Likewise, while many of the theoretical\nframeworks and figures at the heart of Continental feminism are\npresent in trans studies (e.g., post-structuralism, phenomenology,\nFoucauldian genealogy, materialism), there have also been important\ncritiques of how Continental feminist approaches can ignore or\nsideline trans experience. Significantly, many of the philosophers\nworking in Continental feminism and trans studies cited in this entry\ncross inter- and intra-disciplinary boundaries. \nIn exploring the relationship between Continental feminist and trans\nstudies, it is crucial to acknowledge the forms that transphobia and\ntrans-exclusionary gestures can assume in feminist discourse more\ngenerally. For an extended overview of this history, see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on trans issues.\n The entry explains points of terminology (trans, transgender, trans*,\ntranssexual), as well as the historical emergence of transgender\nstudies and the broader (i.e., non-Continental specific) relationship\nbetween feminist and trans issues. \nIn one widely recognized form of feminist transphobia (found in the\nwork of trans-exclusionary radical feminists such as Janice Raymond),\ntrans women are portrayed as not “real” women and as\nthreats to feminist movements (Bettcher 2006, 2007; McKinnon 2018).\nHowever, there is another strand of feminist theory that has a\ndistinct relationship to trans issues, and (importantly for present\npurposes) it is a lineage of feminism that draws heavily on\nContinental figures such as Butler. While there is no doubt that\nButler’s work has been foundational in trans studies as well as\nin queer theory (Gerdes 2014; Salah 2007), it is also the case that\nher work has been critiqued for its selective use of trans experience\n(Prosser 1998; Namaste 1996; H. Rubin 1998). Critics point out that\ntrans identity tends be affirmed in Butlerian queer feminist discourse\nwhen it can be used to demonstrate the actual constructedness of\ngender, or its lack of ontological necessity, but also that some trans\nidentity is portrayed as problematically essentialist when accompanied\nby claims to “really be” a man or a woman and/or demands\nfor medical transition (Valentine 2012). While Prosser and Rubin both\ncritique this rejection of claims to gender realness from a\nphenomenological perspective (and Prosser (1998) from a psychoanalytic\nframework as well), Namaste (1996) focuses on the institutional\nreality of gender that is often sidelined in these debates. In\nresponse, Jack Halberstam has argued that, while Prosser’s\nfrustration with a selective use of trans identity in queer and\nfeminist theory is understandable, there are still significant\nproblems with the normativity inherent in the idea of gendered\nrealness (2005). \nNotably, the proliferation of non-trans feminist writers working on\ntrans issues in the 1990s led to Jacob Hale’s “Suggested\nRules for Non-Transsexuals Writing about Transsexuals, Transsexuality,\nTranssexualism, or Trans” (1997\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n Significant non-trans feminist analyses, following Hale and the\nemergence of transgender studies, include work by Cressida Heyes\n(2003) and Naomi Scheman (1996, 2016), both of whom articulate\ntheoretical bases for solidarity between cis and trans feminists.\nThere are also important instances of cis feminist theorists bringing\ntrans issues directly into their own work as serious interlocutors,\nrather than as thought experiments (Ahmed 2016b; Colebrook 2015;\nShotwell & Sangrey 2008) and collaborating with trans theorists\n(Heyes & Latham 2018). The term “cis” itself has also\nreceived more scholarly attention in the last two decades (Aultman\n2014). While the original intention behind the term was to\ndenaturalize non-trans subject positions, not all scholars agree that\nthe term successfully destabilizes gender norms, particularly insofar\nas such norms are racialized (Enke 2012b). \nMore recently, there have been many new trajectories established at\nthe crossroads of Continental and trans approaches to gender. A number\nof philosophers have written at the intersections of phenomenology and\ntrans studies, particularly in critical phenomenology, which\nemphasizes questions of oppression and power in examining how things\nappear to us in the world (Weiss, Murphy, & Salamon 2020). Ephraim\nDas Janssen uses phenomenology, including the work of Martin\nHeidegger, to examine what transgender experience tells us about\ngender (2017). Megan Burke (2019) takes up Beauvoirian concepts to\nexplore androgyny, trans identity, and agender experience. Gayle\nSalamon draws on the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to develop a\nphenomenology of transphobia in The Life and Death of Latisha\nKing (2018a). Salamon merges a tradition of earlier work in\nphenomenology and trans studies (H. Rubin 1998; Prosser 1998) with\ncritical phenomenology. Tamsin Kimoto (2018) has also used both\nMerleau-Ponty and Frantz Fanon to explore hormonal transition and\ntransphobia. \nAlong similar lines, new work in psychoanalysis and trans studies is\nalso revising longstanding psychoanalytic approaches to sex and\ngender, including coercive and pathologizing theories of trans\nsubjectivity (Elliot 2014), and is using resources in psychoanalysis\nto theorize trans experiences from a less pathologizing perspective\n(Breslow 2017; Carlson 2010; Coffman 2017; Cavanagh 2010). For\nexample, Amy Ray Stewart uses Julia Kristeva’s concept of\n“intimate revolt” to illuminate trans and queer\nexperiences of psychic life (2017). Patricia Gherovici (2017) has\nwritten about trans phenomena and the need to revise psychoanalytic\nconcepts using Lacanian theory and her own clinical experience working\nwith trans people. Relying on both psychoanalytic and phenomenological\nframeworks, Salamon (2010a) has also defended Butler’s account\nof gender against the aforementioned critiques of its treatment of\ntrans experience and developed her own psychoanalytic and\nphenomenological account of a dissonance between a felt sense of\ngender and an external appearance of a body that is attuned to trans\nexperience. \nThere is also a body of work emerging that puts foundational figures\nin Continental feminism into conversation with trans studies. Marie\nDraz (2018) has placed feminist philosophical uses of Nietzsche, such\nas in the work of Butler (1990) and Rosalyn Diprose (2002), into\nconversation with trans scholarship on the institutionalization of\ngender categories, while Tim Johnston (2015) has argued that although\nscholars of gender and sexuality have used Irigarayan resources for\ndiscussing trans and queer issues, Irigaray’s own claim that\nontology is sexed and that there is an impassable limit between the\nsexes conveys an unsalvageable cissexism, or privileging of non-trans\nexperience. In a similar vein, Oli Stephano (2019) critiques Elizabeth\nGrosz’s emphasis on the irreducibility of sexual difference,\nshowing that her ontology invalidates trans embodiment and\nsubjectivities. This critique of Grosz follows earlier work by Eva\nHayward (2017) on the transphobic implications of some of\nGrosz’s feminist materialist arguments. Gayle Salamon also\ncritically examines the way that sexual difference operates as a limit\nto the reimagining of embodiment and materiality in the work of both\nIrigaray and Grosz (Salamon 2010a). María Lugones is another\nfigure of widespread use in Continental feminism who has been\nregularly cited in scholarship on trans issues (Bettcher 2014b;\nDiPietro 2019; Draz 2017a; Malatino 2019). Finally, like Butler, the\nuse of Foucault in trans studies has also changed dramatically over\nthe last several decades. For example, Foucault’s work on types\nof modern power has been used (alongside women of color feminism,\nindigenous scholarship, and numerous other sources) to examine the\nviolence caused by how state institutions administer legal gender\ncategories in sex-segregated institutions and identity documents\n(Spade 2011 [2015]). Foucauldian feminist accounts of prison and\npunishment have also been put into conversation with scholarship\nrooted in trans and gender non-conforming experience (Dilts 2017;\nVitulli 2018; Zurn 2016, 2019). \nTrans studies continues, in different veins, many of the foundational\nquestions of Continental feminism by bringing the tools of Continental\nphilosophy to bear on questions of sex, gender, and sexuality, and\nvice versa, and it continually orients these conversations in new\ndirections. Much of this work is informed by other areas of critical\ntheory (e.g., critical race theory and decolonial theory) and pushes\nthe traditional boundaries of Continental feminism. Recent scholarship\non blackness and trans history, for example, has articulated the\nimportance of developing frameworks capable of understanding the\ndimensions of racialized gender historically and today (Snorton 2017)\nand work on migration and Latinx trans people has highlighted the need\nto attend to both the limits of our political theory and the\nproductive capacities of trans people of color for generating new\nworlds (Pitts 2018). Current conversations about the relationship\nbetween Continental feminism and trans studies must also involve\nattention to the material conditions of the academy itself, as the\ngrowing attention to trans experience in philosophy more broadly has\nnot resulted in more trans voices and trans academics (Bettcher 2018\n(Other Internet Resources); Marvin 2019, 2020). Future directions in\nContinental feminism and trans studies will need to be attentive not\nonly to the intriguing philosophical questions occurring in these\nconversations, but also to the specific contours of the material\nconditions that allow trans scholarship to flourish. \nThis section explores the relationship between Continental feminism\nand Asian American feminist thought, both the tensions between the two\nas well as new directions that this relation brings to Continental\nfeminism. A major point of convergence between the two fields is the\nfocus on lived experience of Asian American women. This section begins\nby discussing the hypervisibility that Asian American women experience\ndue to the specific forms of oppression that they face, namely,\norientalization and the Model Minority myth. It then highlights the\nparadoxical form of invisibility that Asian American feminist\nphenomenologist trace in their body of work. Next, this section\nconsiders the historical position of Asian American women in\ncoalitional feminist projects, especially focusing on the ways in\nwhich Asian American women have been relegated to a\n“tag-along” group. Finally, this section will highlight\nrecent scholarship in Continental feminism that engages with Asian\nAmerican feminist theory and draws upon both Eastern and Western\ntraditions. \nIt must be noted from the outset that “Asian” is an\nexceptionally broad term, and the peoples that are considered\nAsian/Asian American have often changed throughout history. In\naccordance with anthologies by Asian American women that respond to\nthis very issue, this section addresses the identities of women who\ntrace their roots back to East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian\nsubcontinent (Asian Women United of California 1989; The Women of\nSouth Asian Descent Collective 1993). \nIn This Bridge Called My Back (Moraga & Anzaldúa\n1981 [2015]), Asian American thinkers such as Genny Lim, Merle Woo, Nellie\nWong, and Mitsuye Yamada established their positions in feminist\ntheorizing by exploring their own perspectives on topics surrounding\ngendered identity, sexuality, silencing, the feeling of not-belonging,\nand living against stereotypes of Asian American women as docile,\nquiet, agreeable, and submissive. Similarly, in This Bridge We\nCall Home (Anzaldúa & Keating 2002), Minh-ha T. Pham,\nShirley Geok-Lin Lim, and Jid Lee theorize from the specific\nexperiences that they face as Asian American immigrant women, such as\nexploring a connection to an Asian mother who emigrated to the United\nStates, navigating the cultural connection they still hold to a land\nthat they may have never visited, and living in the face of the Model\nMinority myth while also subverting the stereotype. Writings that\ncenter the perspective of the Asian American and diasporic Asian woman\nare essential for Asian American feminist theorizing, for, as Sonia\nShah emphasized, \n[a]n Asian American feminist movement is the only movement\nthat will consistently represent Asian American women’s\ninterests. (1998: xix) \nTwo early anthologies were very important for the formation of Asian\nAmerican feminism: Making Waves (Asian Women United of\nCalifornia [AWUC] 1989) and The Forbidden Stitch (Lim &\nTsutakawa 1989); they both include writings from different ethnic and\nnational backgrounds, specifically Chinese, Japanese, Filipino,\nKorean, Vietnamese, and Indian (Hill-Collins & Bilge 2016: 73). In\na recent volume entitled Asian American Feminisms and Women of\nColor Politics, editors Lynn Fujiwara and Shireen Roshanravan\npresent a series of articles emerging at the intersection of Asian\nAmerican feminist engagement with Women of Color coalition politics,\norganizing around concepts, methods, and epistemic principles central\nto Women of Color feminist scholarship (Fujiwara & Roshanravan\n2018) \nHypervisibility of Asian American women is a central issue in most\nAsian American feminist projects. Some Asian American feminist\ntheorists, such as Robin Zheng, argue that Asian American women are\nhypervisible because they are hypersexualized, orientalized, and\nexoticized. Robin Zheng (2016) discusses the complexities of\nhypervisibility “Why Yellow Fever Isn’t Flattering: A Case\nAgainst Racial Fetishes”. Zheng argues that there is little\ndifference between what is known as “yellow fever”, the\nracial fetishization and preference of Asian women and men, and what\nshe calls the “Mere Preference Argument”, which attempts\nto claim that there is nothing morally wrong with preferring certain\nracialized phenotypic traits; as she shows, despite the origin of a\nracialized fetish, both yellow fever and other racialized fetishes\n“depersonalize and otherize” their subjects (2016: 412).\nZheng shows that these fetishes are not just harmless personal\npreferences, but a set of practices and thought patterns that result\nin negative social impacts for Asian American women. Relatedly, Asian\nAmerican women are also hypervisible due to the “Model Minority\nmyth”, that is, the myth that asserts that Asian Americans are\nuniquely hard-working and thus, the ideal “model”\nminority, especially in contrast with other minority groups. This myth\nmakes Asian American women hypervisible by making them a part of a\ngroup of people who are defined by their ability to achieve upward\nclass mobility (K. Lee 2014). \nParadoxically, Asian American women are also rendered invisible in\nvarious feminist movements and discourses. Asian American feminist\ndiscussions on invisibility differ from other discussions within\nContinental feminism on visibility and feminine erasure due to their\ndual existence as both invisible subjects and hypervisible\nrepresentations of stereotypes. Poet and activist Mitsuye Yamada\nstates that Asian American women are “the visible minority that\nis invisible” (1981b). Yamada means this claim in two ways:\nfirst, in regard to how Asian American women are rendered invisible in\nconversations surrounding women of color oppressions; and second, in\nregard to how the oppressions experienced by Asian American women are\noften invisible to themselves. In order to carve out a space for\nthemselves in feminist theorizing, Asian American women in this book\nshared their stories that demonstrate the struggle of becoming visible\nto oneself while existing in a world that constantly demands\none’s invisibility. Yamada’s explains how she was\ninvisible to herself because she practiced passive resistance while\nbelieving that others did not see her as the stereotype of an Asian\nAmerican women. In order to become visible to herself and others, she\nrealized that she must act in ways, such as displaying anger in\nresponse to sexist and racist acts, that an oppressive gaze would\nclaim was “uncharacteristic” of her as an Asian American\nwoman (1981b: 40). At the same time, the Model Minority myth can also\nparadoxically render Asian American women invisible by making them\nhypervisible as successful paradigms that are perceived as lacking\nexperiences of oppression and violence and thus have no credibility to\nspeak to these lived experiences. \nAs a result of this specific form of invisibility, Asian American\nfeminists proposed new methods of political organization in order to\ninclude the voices of Asian American women in feminist coalitions. The\nsimilarities between writings that span nearly two decades gesture to\none of the many issues faced by Asian American feminism: Asian\nAmerican feminists have often been seen, and arguably still are seen,\nas a group in the background that is simply, as Yamada described,\n“tagging along” in feminist theorization against\noppressions (1981b: 40). In other words, Asian American women are\noften seen as individuals who do not often experience oppressions that\nare specific to their own identities and, therefore, have no place in\nfighting oppression. In response to this, we can see activists such as\nGrace Lee Boggs, who have worked closely with other people of color in\nthe fight against different oppressions (Boggs & Boggs 1974; 1998\n[2016]; Boggs & Kurashige 2011); Lisa Lowe’s essay on\nheterogeneity, hybridity, and multipolicy of Asian American\nwomen’s experiences (Lowe 1991); and more recent Asian American\nfeminist projects that include Asian Americans women in liberatory\nprojects in a manner that does not simply relegate them to tag-along\npositions (Shah 1998; Fujiwara & Roshanravan, 2018). \nA growing number of recent works in Asian American feminism engage\nwith figures and themes in Continental feminism through the framework\nEastern philosophy and the Asian American women’s perspective\nand as such they provide new directions for a genuinely\ntransContinental feminism. For example, building on the discussions\nconcerning gender in Continental feminisms, thinkers such as Kyoo Lee\n(2014) and Robin Wang (2016) have explored different ways that the\ngendered body has been discussed. Engaging with the concept of the\n“dark female animal” (xuapin) in\nDaodejing, Kyoo Lee explores the revolutionary potential of\nxuapin, which she claims possesses a gender-bending power.\nLee argues that xuapin demonstrates \nin a sense, superiority of femaleness and femininity –as\nthe norm, albeit invisible and inaudible \nand that it is \ngender-bending: female and not female at once, heterosexualized and\nnot at once. (K. Lee 2014: 59) \nWang investigates yin-yang gender dynamics through a variety of both\nEastern and Western sources in order to answer whether yin-yang gender\nconstruction allows for gender equality. Alluding to Continental\nfeminists who wrote on gender such as Simone de Beauvoir, Judith\nButler, and Luce Irigaray, Wang discusses an exploration of gender\nthrough a Chinese framework (the yin-yang) that does not make a clear\ndistinction between sex and gender. Wang argues that yin-yang gender\nconstruction offers a dynamic and fluid description of gender\nrelationships (Wang 2016: 224). \nThis entry has listed a number of ways in which Continental approaches\nand figures are used to address feminist issues; we have attempted\nboth to describe some of the ongoing research areas in Continental\nfeminism and to point out new directions it has been taking over the\npast decades. However, this list remains incomplete as we have been\nunable to account for all of the important work underway. A more\ncomplete entry would need to include projects on the intersection\nbetween Continental feminism and critical disability studies,\nindigenous feminisms, and new materialisms and humanisms. Furthermore,\nwe do not mean to suggest that there is no overlap or intersection\nbetween the topics or figures grouped under each section heading here.\nLastly, there is certainly ongoing work of which we are not aware that\nis already making an impact on the present and future of feminist\nscholarship. We thus conclude here not with a summative statement\ndefining Continental feminism but rather by reflecting on the material\nconditions of Continental feminism. \nWhen Linda Martín Alcoff addressed the Eastern American\nPhilosophical Association in 2012, she reflected on the tension and\nissues within disciplinary philosophy and urged philosophers to\n“apply our diagnostic impulses to ourselves” (Alcoff 2013:\n43). A necessary aspect of such praxis for Continental feminists in\nlight of the genealogies considered here is exemplified by Audre Lorde\nwho, speaking on the “Personal is Political Panel” at the\nSecond Sex Conference in 1979, stated \nI urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of\nknowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any\ndifference that lives there. See whose face it wears. (Lorde 1984a:\n101) \nLorde calls feminists to enact a humble and frank confrontation with\ntheir own embodied lives and senses of self in the context of each\nperson’s differential implication in racist, sexist,\nheterosexist, classist and ableist power. Rather than imagining that\none puts on one’s thinking hat and reflects “as a\ntheorist” and then take it off and acts “as a regular\nperson”, Continental feminisms suggest that the subject who\ntheorizes is themself always an embodied subject: Kris Sealey reminds\nus that “Continental methods oftentimes refract differently\nacross race and gender axes” and that for this reason,\nContinental feminists ought “to be intentional about the\nrelationship they occupy, quite simultaneously, to racial and gender\nliberation” (Sealey 2017: 166). As this entry has shown, the\ndiversity of Continental feminist thought has been developed through\nthe thoughtful negotiation of many different struggles. For the\nimagined community of Continental feminism to continue to grow and\nsupport these projects, space must continually be made for new\npractitioners. Since, as we put above, Continental feminism is less\nconcerned with changing a woman’s place in a symbolic or social\nsystem, and more on upending that system itself, members of this\nacademic community must continue to do the work that will make it\npossible to learn from each other. Only in this way Continental\nfeminism can be opened up fully to its interdisciplinary\npotential.","contact.mail":"mdraz@sdsu.edu","contact.domain":"sdsu.edu"},{"date.published":"2020-11-10","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/femapproach-continental/","author1":"Dilek Huseyinzadegan","author2":"Jana McAuliffe","entry":"femapproach-continental","body.text":"\n\n\n\n\n[Editor’s Note: The following new entry replaces the\n former entry\n on this topic by the previous author.]\n\n\n\n\nContinental feminism denotes an approach to feminist issues in\nphilosophy and the world both via figures and methods of what\nis called the “Continental” tradition in philosophy\nand via critical interventions into this tradition.\nContinental tradition in philosophy today refers to a set of\nnineteenth and twentieth century figures and theoretical traditions\nfrom mainland Europe, arising as a way for English-speaking\nphilosophers in the United States to distinguish their approach to\nphilosophical questions from that of the analytic tradition. By\nutilizing one or more of the signature schemas of the Continental\ntradition, Continental feminists contribute to problem areas ranging\nfrom metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, and social and\npolitical philosophy. Continental feminism thus refers to a body and\nstyle of work consisting of feminist interpretations of mainstream\nContinental figures (largely from what is called “Continental\nEurope”, such as Hegel, Levinas, Derrida, Foucault); feminist\nuses of psychoanalysis, phenomenology, deconstruction, genealogy, and\ncritical theory; and of interpretations of European feminists and\nfigures such as de Beauvoir, Irigaray, Arendt, and Kristeva. Note,\nhowever, that Europe is not and has never been a continent, and in\nthis sense, Continental feminism, like Continental philosophy, is more\nof an imagined community of approaches, figures, and traditions, or an\numbrella concept, rather than a precise term.\n\n\nElaine Miller points out that the term “Continental\nfeminism” came into circulation in the United States in 2007\n(Miller 2017); as she defines it, Continental feminism\n\n\n\n\ninvolves a commitment to the historicity of philosophical concepts,\nincluding the sometimes-uncomfortable contexts of their production, a\nbelief that it is through the examination of texts that the genealogy\nof ideas can be traced and resources for critically responding to them\ncan be formulated, and that the “canon” is subject to\nconstant re-interrogation and reconfiguration. (Miller 2017: 154)\n\n\n\nIn Allison Stone’s terms,\n\n\n\n\ndescribing the world as it really is—not as an aggregate of\nstatic items but as an ever-shifting web of relations—calls for\nunfamiliar, difficult language. (Stone 2015: 4)\n\n\n\nA distinguishing feature of Continental feminism, Miller and Stone\nagree, is that it\n\n\n\n\nembodies a refusal to prima facie privilege clarity and\nsuccinctness of argument over acknowledging through language the\ncomplexity, difficulty, and problematic nature of the issues being\naddressed. (Miller 2017: 154; Stone 2015: 2)\n\n\n\nAs a way of beginning to address the Euro- and U.S.-centric biases of\ncontinental philosophy, a transContinental turn in Continental\nfeminism proposed by Kyoo Lee and Alyson Cole aims to incorporate a\nglobal view of feminist issues and theories, where\n\n\n\n\n“trans” serves as a marker for the constant geo-cultural\nflows of ideas in transit, as in “transatlantic”,\n“transpacific”, “transoceanic”, etc., as well\nas for cutting-edge works, conversations, and debates in\ntrans-critical, cultural, disciplinary, human, gender, genic, lingual,\nmedial, national fields, etc., and as trans*feminist discourses. (Cole\nand Lee 2019: iv)\n\n\n\nAccordingly, this entry will take Continental feminism to include the\nfollowing distinct yet related set of issues and areas: (1) the\nfeminist use of figures, traditions, and approaches of\nphenomenology/existentialism, psychoanalysis, post-structuralism\n(deconstruction and genealogy), and critical theory; (2) critical\ninterventions into the assumptions about sex, gender, class, race,\nability, religion, and age endemic to European philosophy; and (3)\ninterpretations of hitherto underrepresented figures and methods of\nfeminism from a transContinental and transAtlantic perspective that\nestablish new, abandoned, or previously delegitimated genealogies for\nfeminist thought.\n\n\nIt is important to note that not all Continental feminists are\nphilosophers or work in Philosophy departments; thus, Continental\nfeminism is interdisciplinary and its practitioners come from various\nfields. As this subfield developed in the early 2000s, there were\nalready disciplinary, intra-disciplinary and extra-disciplinary\nprojects that explored feminist issues by utilizing phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, deconstructive, and critical theoretical approaches.\nRather than organizing this entry around the signature schemas of the\nContinental tradition and subsuming ongoing work that uses these\napproaches under them, this entry will locate crucial genealogies for\nContinental feminism in the work of Black feminists, post- and\ndecolonial feminists, women of color feminists, Asian American\nfeminists, trans feminists, and queer feminists. We take these\ngenealogies as central to the past, present, and future of Continental\nfeminism, and accordingly this entry is organized topically, in order\nto outline the ways that Continental feminisms have developed in\nconversation and in tension with these interdisciplinary projects.\nThese projects have been unearthing the cissexist,\nsexist/misogynistic, racist, heterosexist, classist, ageist, ableist,\ncolonial commitments of philosophy as a discipline and a professional\nfield as they are simultaneously expanding, transforming, and pushing\nthe concerns and methods of Continental thought in interdisciplinary\niterations. Indeed, what distinguishes Continental feminism clearly\nfrom Analytic feminism are its call for interdisciplinarity and its\nbelief that feminist omissions themselves can become sites from which\nnew projects are launched, as will be highlighted throughout this\nentry. As such, Continental feminism starts with the premise that\nEuropean or Anglo-American norms and categories of thought can be\ninterpreted, critiqued, and re-envisioned or abandoned for feminist\npurposes.\n\nContinental feminists share with other Continental thinkers an\ninterest in close reading that uses careful exegesis to unpack the\ndeep meanings of texts through attention to their linguistic and\nhistorical specificity. However, to utilize a philosophical tradition\nthat has largely presumed rather than explored the impacts of sex and\ngender on material life, continental feminists often read irreverently\nto focus on concerns that traditional philosophy might push to the\nside. While all feminist theorizing deals with questions of power,\nsubjectivity, and culture, Continental feminist approaches to these\nissues are often critical in the sense that they explore how\nexternal power dynamics affect the constitution of inner experiences,\nand in turn how embodied and subjective re-articulations of power can\nand should transform the world in the pursuit of justice. This\nfrequently involves taking lived experience as a crucial component of\ncritical philosophy; as Gail Weiss puts it, \nonly by interrogating the “ordinary” dimensions of\nexperience is it possible to arrive at an understanding of the dynamic\nforces that give meaning to individual lives and that are both the\nobstacle and the vehicle to achieving lasting social change. (Weiss\n2008: 5) \nTo present a broad sketch of characteristics of continental feminism\nthroughout its history, this section focuses on methods that\nContinental feminists use to engage embodied experience in their\nprojects. The gendered critique of the traditional Western\nphilosophical tendency to dichotomize the body that feels and the mind\nthat thinks is an ongoing theme in continental feminism (see entry on\n feminist perspectives on the body).\n The account presented here is not at all complete, as the specific\naims and methods of such feminist projects differ widely, most\nimportantly in terms of how an analysis of sex and gender is impacted\nby other aspects of embodied experience such as race, sexuality, and\nability. This section first addresses some ways that continental\nfeminists trouble a mind-body distinction by engaging affect and\nemotion in their work. Next, it explores two examples of how\ncontinental traditions, psychoanalysis and phenomenology, are made\ninto critical resources in Continental feminist projects. Finally, it\npresents work that engages an ongoing critique of culture and everyday\nexperience as an important aspect of feminist theorizing. \nMany Continental feminists focus on the overlaying of mental and\nphysical experience via the concepts of affect, emotion, and feeling.\nAffect is described by Teresa Brennan as “the physiological\nshift accompanying a judgment” (Brennan 2004: 5). The\n“transmission of affect” describes the way that one can\ncatch the mood of another; this experience is “social in origin\nbut biological and physical in effect” (Brennan 2004: 3).\nBrennan describes transmission as when the “emotions or\naffects of one person, and the enhancing or depressing energies these\naffects entail” pass from one person to another (Brennan 2004:\n3). Affect is thus one way to describe how social experience impacts\nthe corporeal life of subjects through the transference of energy. In\nBrennan’s case, affective states are directional; they\nare not neutral but push or press on subjects. At the same time, terms\nlike affect and feeling might be distinguished based on the extent to\nwhich one considers affect to be already coded with or influenced by\nsocial significance for a subject (see Ahmed 2010: 230–231,\nSeigworth & Gregg 2010, esp. 5–8). \nContinental feminist projects on emotion often analyze historically\ncontextualized experiences. Ann Cvetkovich engages with trauma in a\nway that \nfocuses on the everyday and the insidious…and situates it in a\nsocial and cultural frame rather than a medical one. (Cvetkovich 2007:\n464) \nShe then presents a political account of depression that\ndepathologizes such negatively-connotated emotional experiences so\nthat they can become more visible in public and thus create a\npotential foundation for community (Cvetkovich 2007: 460). In The\nCultural Politics of Emotion, Sara Ahmed argues that emotion is\ngenerated when meaning is produced across social-political\ninteraction; these feelings create the boundaries of affinity groups\nand impact self-understanding. In this analysis, emotions help\nconstitute what a person understands as their objective condition, and\nthus \nemotions are not “in” either the individual or the social,\nbut produce the very surfaces and boundaries that allow all kinds of\nobjects to be delineated. (Ahmed 2004 [2014: 10]) \nBecause feeling is often ambivalent and multi-faceted, rather than in\nspite of this complexity, social critics who attend to how affects are\nemployed and manipulated in both textual and social-political\nargumentation can produce readings that trouble an easy dichotomy\nbetween what is a “good” and what a “bad”\nexperience. \nPsychoanalytically-informed projects use concepts such as trauma,\nmourning, melancholia, and abjection to analyze embodied experience\n(Irigaray 1974 [1985]; Spillers 1996; Butler 1997; Felman 2002; Oliver\n2004; entry on\n psychoanalytic feminism).\n They frequently engage aesthetics as an aspect of social critique\n(Chanter 2008; Kristeva 1980 [1982]; Miller 2014). This allows a\nsymptomatic reading of feeling to be interpreted back against the\nsocial order, as is seen in Judith Butler’s Frames of\nWar. In this text, Butler analyzes what makes a life grievable\nand argues that the questions of who appears as a human, whose life\nshould be protected, and who does not are all figured in advance of\nany particular political decision through a pre-reflexive manipulation\nof affect (Butler 2009 [2016: 64]). Supplementing democratic theory\nwith Continental feminist interpretations, Noëlle McAfee deploys\nKristeva and the resources in her thought, as well as psychoanalysis,\nspecifically on the issues of affect and the notion of the\n“political unconscious” (McAfee 2000 and 2008). \nCritical phenomenologists draw on the methods of phenomenology to\ndemonstrate “the multiple ways in which power moves through our\nbodies and our lives” (Introduction, Weiss, Murphy, &\nSalamon 2020: xiv). Lisa Guenther understands critical phenomenology\nas both a way of doing philosophy and a way of approaching political\nactivism (Guenther 2020: 15). Most characteristically, Guenther argues\nthat critical phenomenology employs reworked versions of \nMerleau-Ponty’s concept of the body schema to account for\ngendered and sexual schemas (Simone de Beauvoir, Iris Marion Young,\nTalia Mae Bettcher, Gayle Salamon), racialized schemas (Frantz Fanon,\nLewis Gordon, Sara Ahmed, George Yancy, Alia Al-Saji), disability\nschemas (Kay Toombs, Lisa Diedrich, Havi Carel), and other aspects of\nlived experience. (Guenther 2020: 13–14) \nA recent volume edited by Gail Weiss, Ann V, Murphy, and Gayle\nSalamon, entitled 50 Concepts for a Critical* Phenomenology\n(2020), shows that many of the central concepts of critical\nphenomenology intersect with Continental feminism. \nFinally, considering the social and political import of inner states\nand the centering of quotidian experiences of power enable Continental\nfeminists to explore culture as it develops. For instance, Shannon\nSullivan’s Good White People: The Problem with Middle-Class\nAnti-Racism focuses on “the personal side of whiteness and\nwhite privilege” with attention to the embodied experience of\nrace (S. Sullivan 2014: 19) to critique the ways through which white\nliberals set themselves up as altruistic, “good” white\npeople through, e.g., hypocritical modes of tolerance that maintain\nwhite domination (S. Sullivan 2014: 4). Robin James’\nResilience & Melancholy explores pop music as a way to\nanalyze the impact of neoliberal biopolitics; she combines music\ntheory with psychoanalytic and Foucauldian philosophies to critique\ncomplicity with multi-racial white supremacist patriarchy and argues\nthat music, e.g., Rihanna’s, offer strategies for countering\nthis oppressive power (R. James 2015). In Irony in the Age of\nEmpire: Comic Perspectives on Philosophy and Freedom, Cynthia\nWillett engages film and stand-up comedy to articulate a libidinal\nunderstanding of freedom that can counter the liberal paradigms of\nindividuality with a sense of freedom defined “in terms of\nequality and solidarity” (Willett 2008: 14). Erin Tarver\nanalyzes practices of sports fans, with particular attention to\nfootball, baseball, and basketball fans in the American South, to\nbetter understand how individual and group identities are maintained\nto “…shore up, reproduce, and very occasionally, subvert\nracial, sexual and gender hierarchies” (Tarver 2017: 3). This\nwork is often interdisciplinary, and some of these projects work at\nthe intersection between continental and pragmatist feminisms (see\nentry on\n intersections between pragmatist and continental feminism). \nSimultaneously reading carefully and irreverently, continental\nfeminists deepen the philosophical account of experience by\nintegrating historically contextualized feeling into their projects,\nusing and transmuting philosophical traditions and traditional\nfigures, and interrogating everyday experiences in their embodied and\ncultural specificity. This work insists that meaning and social order\nfunction through unrecognized cooptation, subordination or exclusion\nin various intersectional constellations. In general, continental\nfeminisms are less concerned with changing a woman’s place in a\nsymbolic or social system, and more focused on upending such systems,\nas will be explored in more detail in the following sections. \nThis section on the convergences between Black and Continental\nfeminist thought begins with a discussion about the history of Black\nfeminist scholarship utilizing existential/phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, critical, and hermeneutic approaches. It then\nintroduces intersectionality as the major heuristic for Black feminist\ntheorizing, and concludes by highlighting emerging areas and\nintersections between Black studies and Black feminist Continental\nthought. \nBlack women have long been contributors to the Continental\nphilosophical tradition. One may argue that their contributions to\nprofessional philosophy started after the graduation of the first\nBlack woman to earn the PhD in philosophy, Joyce Mitchell Cook, who\ncompleted the degree in 1965 from Princeton University. Even prior to\nthis date, however, Black women engaged in projects that we can\nrecognize as Continental feminist projects. Importantly, \nmany Black intellectuals in the United States going back (at least) to\nthe nineteenth century offered what are now described as existential,\nphenomenological, and/or genealogical analyses of race and racism.\n(Belle 2012, 329 fn. 1) \nThese contributions did not always occur in the form of traditional\nphilosophical discussions, nor are they always created by those who\nhave professional degrees in philosophy, which is certainly true of\nthe nineteenth and early twentieth century thinkers, Sojourner Truth,\nMaria W. Stewart, and\n Anna Julia Cooper. \nBlack feminists’ contributions to Continental philosophy\ndemonstrate the ways in which their voices are crucial to both shaping\nand expanding the discipline. Kathryn Sophia Belle, Donna-Dale\nMarcano, and Maria del Guadalupe Davidson edited Convergences:\nBlack Feminism and Continental Philosophy (del Guadalupe et al.\n2010), the only text at the publication of this entry that addresses\nboth these topics simultaneously. For the editors, the concept of\nconvergence is demonstrated by the natural, historical, and necessary\nengagement of Black women with Continental philosophy. Belle\nwrites, \nBlack feminist and womanist thinkers inevitably address the very same\nissues of agency, identity, alienation, power, and so on that are\nraised in much recent Continental philosophy. Likewise, from Immanuel\nKant to the feminist thinkers of the present, Continental philosophy\nhas engaged, to some extent, with issues of race and gender. (2010:\n5) \nThe Black feminist tradition in Continental philosophy demonstrates\nthat Black women are not strangers nor enemies of Continental\nphilosophy; rather, their unique theoretical positioning affords them\nthe opportunity to utilize, challenge, and expand the tradition. \nBlack feminist thinkers contribute to Continental feminist thought in\nat least two ways. First, they engage directly with Continental\nfigures and theories. For example, Lorraine Hansberry comments that\nSimone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex (1949, translated\nin 1953) was arguably the “most important work of this\ncentury” (1957 [1995: 129 and 133]), and Antillean thinker\nPaulette Nardal draws on both features of the Harlem Renaissance and\nexistentialist thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre to provide a\nphenomenological and genealogical account of how the Black race, and\nAntilleans in particular, have come to understand their own notion of\nrace consciousness in “The Awakening of Race\nConsciousness” (1932). More recently, they engage with canonical\nfigures and ideologies of Continental philosophy, as in the work of\nKathryn Sophia Belle on Hannah Arendt (2014) or Kris Sealey on\nEmmanuel Levinas (2014). Second, regardless of their professional\nPhilosophy degrees or lack thereof, Black feminist thinkers utilize\nthe tools of the Continental tradition as part of their\ninterdisciplinary approaches, as in the use of Foucault in the work of\nSylvia Wynter (2003) and the use of Freud, Lacan, and psychoanalysis\nin the work of Hortense Spillers (1996). \nBlack feminist thinkers have frequently used intersectionality as an\neffective entry-point into conversations with the Continental\ntradition. Intersectionality is a Black feminist theory that describes\nthe oppression that Black women experience as a result of lying at the\nnexus of simultaneously impactful identities, such as that of race,\ngender, class, and sexuality. As such, intersectionality can be used\nas a phenomenological tool to describe Black women’s lived\nexperience of oppression. While legal theorist Kimberlé\nCrenshaw coined the term in 1989, the theory has been articulated at\nleast since the mid-nineteenth century in Sojourner Truth’s\nproclamation, “Ain’t I a Woman?” (1851). In the\nspeech, Truth highlights that Black women are treated with less\nrespect than white women while bearing the same burdens of racism as\nBlack men. Anna Julia Cooper wrote that Black women are \nconfronted by a both a woman question and a race problem and is as yet\nan unknown or an unacknowledged factor in both. (1892 [1988: 134]) \nIn their collective statement from April 1977, The Combahee River\nCollective argues that \nBlack feminism [is] the logical political movement to combat the\nmanifold and simultaneous oppressions that all women of color face \nand that \n[t]here is also undeniably a personal genesis for Black feminism, that\nis, the political realization that comes from the seemingly personal\nexperiences of individual Black women’s lives. (Taylor 2017: 15\nand 17) \nIntersectionality is thus a hallmark of Black feminist thought because\nit prioritizes the lived experiences of Black women. In doing so, it\nsupplies the tools to think about the extent to which one’s\nconsciousness the world is informed by experiences of racism, sexism,\nclassism, and homophobia. \nIn addition to its utility in explaining Black women’s lived\nexperience, intersectionality also provides tools for Black feminists\nto critique the presumed whiteness and bourgeois-class status of\nfeminism and to combat various forms of oppression and violence. Thus,\nintersectionality is also key to critiquing phenomenological analysis,\nthat is, analysis of lived experiences and feminist movements through\nthe lens of sociopolitical identities such as race, sex, and class.\nAngela Davis’s text Women, Race, & Class (1981) is\nan early model of this approach; it details the history of U.S.\nwomen’s movements and their consideration, or lack thereof, of\nthe class-based and racial dimensions of womanhood. Texts such as\nPatricia Hill-Collins’s Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge,\nConsciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment (1990 [2015]) underscore\nthe ways in which Black women create their own epistemological\nstandpoint as a result of their lived experiences. In the 1970s to\n90s, when Black women’s contributions to academia reached its\nzenith, Black feminist scholars such as Barbara Christian in\n“The Race for Theory” (1988), Toni Morrison in Playing\nin the Dark (1992), and Audre Lorde in “The Master’s\nTools will Never Dismantle the Master’s House” (1984a) and\n“Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference”\n(1984b) exemplified Black women’s critiques of theoretical\napproaches that adopt a “neutral” stance toward feminist\nmovements where neutral meant presuming all women to be white,\nmiddle-class, young or middle-aged, and heterosexual (see also Hull,\nBell-Scott, & Smith 1982). \nCurrent Black feminist work centers Black epistemologies,\npractices, and concepts. The burgeoning scholarship of Black women\nphilosophers continue to push the boundaries of Continental feminism,\nas in the work of Lindsey Stewart’s work on Black feminist\npractices of freedom (2017), Camisha Russell’s work on the\nissues of race and gender in assisted reproduction (2018), and Axelle\nKarera’s work, which focuses on the Anthropocene and\nantiBlackness (2019). In addition to engaging with the canonical\nfigures of the Continental tradition, Black thinkers harvest\nphilosophy from their own perspective and experience of the world as\nwell as their theoretical archives. Much of this more recent work\nintersects with Black Studies. The work of Black thinkers from\ndisciplines other than philosophy are intersecting with Continental\nphilosophical and feminist approaches, as seen in the works of such as\nSaidiya Hartman (1997, 2007, and 2019), Christina Sharpe (2016),\nRizvana Bradley (2014 and 2018), Jennifer Nash (2019), Denise Ferreira\nda Silva (2007, 2014, and 2018), Riley Snorton (2017), Selamawit\nTerrefe (2020), and Zakiyyah Iman Jackson (2020). \nContinental feminist approaches to questions on colonialism revolve\naround two main sets of investigations: on the one hand, the\ninterrogation of the hegemony of the West as an abstract category that\nis deployed strategically to exclude and inferiorize communities\ndeemed Non-Western (Spivak 1999; Narayan 1997; Mohanty 1984), and on\nthe other hand, the question of coloniality, which focuses on the\npolitical and epistemic ordering of the globe starting with the\ncolonization of the Americas (Lugones 2003; Wynter 1995; Ortega 2016).\nTo this end, these approaches both use schemas of the Continental\ntradition (such as phenomenology, psychoanalysis, genealogy,\ndeconstruction, and poststructuralism) and call into question the\ngeographic and racial assumptions that underlie Continental\nphilosophy. For both of these approaches, an analysis of colonialism\nis inseparable from the political aim of challenging and undoing the\ncolonial world. This challenge entails deconstructing the categories\nof the colonially determined globe (such as East-West,\nWestern-Non-Western, Developed-Underdeveloped, First World-Third\nWorld, North-South) through focusing on the concrete lived experiences\nof individuals and communities. This section focuses on the general\ncharacteristics of these two Continental feminist approaches taken up\nunder the rough categories of postcolonial and decolonial feminisms,\nwith the former focusing on the Western-Non-western divide that marks\ncolonial relations, and the latter on the North-South dialogues that\nemerge within the relations of coloniality. It concludes by\nhighlighting coalitional thinking, a fundamental aspect of both post-\nand decolonial feminist approaches. \nPostcolonial feminist approaches maintain that in order to interrogate\nthe hegemony of the West, it is necessary to deconstruct the ways in\nwhich it is deployed to exclude the non-Western subject. Furthermore,\nsuch deployment is always a strategic one, insofar as the\n“West” is not a concrete geographical category, and the\nparadigm of Western subjectivity is continuously built by demarcating\nthose who do not fit in it. Postcolonial feminisms are\ninterdisciplinary and not limited to the field of philosophy, and they\nchallenge the inscription of the gender, racial, and geographic\ncategories that underlie the hegemony of the Western subject. In doing\nso, Continental feminist approaches engage with figures from\npoststructuralism and critical theory (such as Foucault, Derrida,\nDeleuze and Adorno), and they deploy methods such as genealogy and\ndeconstruction (Spivak 1988; Mohanty 1984), in order to question the\nunderlying geographic and gendered assumptions of these methods. In\n“Can the Subaltern Speak?” for example, Gayatri\nChakravorty Spivak engages with French poststructuralism and questions\nthe paradigms of speech/reason that deny the very possibility of\ncapacities such as resistance for those that do not fit within the\ngeographic, racialized, and gendered boundaries of Western\nSubjectivity (Spivak 1988). In doing so, she highlights the ways in\nwhich poststructuralism relies upon the very categories (of speech,\nreason, or universal subjectivity) that it ostensibly critiques. \nThe tension highlighted by Spivak, in which the Western Subject\nconstitutes both the dominant subject and the only subject capable of\nresistance, underlies postcolonial feminisms’ critique of the\nalignment of the West with modernity and progress (McClintock 1995;\nStoler 1995). Chandra Talpade Mohanty, in “Under Western\nEyes”, criticizes the hegemony of Western approaches in defining\nthe scope and goals of feminist struggles. Issues such as the veil\ndebate, in this sense, point to the political and phenomenological\nracialization of the Non-Western woman (Al-Saji 2010; Sheth 2006). At\nthe same time, Uma Narayan draws attention to the risks of fetishizing\nthe category of the Non-Western and highlights how such a\nfetishization remains within colonially determined divisions (Narayan\n1997; Narayan & Harding 2000). Namita Goswami, in Subjects\nThat Matter, develops heterogeneity as a kind of conceptual\ncontinuity between feminism, philosophy, and postcolonial studies,\nwhich allows for an understanding of difference beyond oppositional\nand antagonistic terms (Goswami 2019). \nDecolonial feminisms emerge primarily from the U.S. Latina and Latinx\ncontexts and have a different genealogy, insofar as they are in\ndialogue with Latin American Philosophy, Continental Philosophy,\nAnglo-American Thought, and especially U.S. Women of Color feminisms.\nFocusing on North-South dialogues, Latin American and Latina Feminist\nphilosophers such as Ofelia Schutte engage with the work of figures\nsuch as Nietzsche, Kristeva, and Irigaray while developing Latin\nAmerican philosophy as a field in U.S. academic philosophy (Schutte\n1984; 1993; for more, see the entry on\n Latin American feminism).\n Linda Martín Alcoff, for example, brings Latin American\nPhilosophy (particularly the work of Enrique Dussel) in dialogue with\nexistentialism and poststructuralism in order to develop the framework\nfor Latinx feminisms (Alcoff 2006, 2015). \nOne of the major frameworks of decolonial feminisms is “the\ncoloniality of power”, a term first introduced by Aníbal\nQuijano, and defined as “the social classification of the\nworld’s population around the idea of race” (Quijano 2000:\n1). In this sense, the colonization of the Americas is not only a\nhistorical moment, but also the emergence of race and the subsequent\nreorganization of the globe in accordance with what Walter Mignolo\ncalls “the colonial difference”, denoting the abstract\npositioning of Europe as the global hegemonic power (Mignolo 2002).\nDecolonial feminisms take an intersectional approach to the\ncoloniality of power and investigate, as María Lugones says,\n“the emergence of hegemonic gender arrangements along\n‘racial’ lines” starting with the colonization of\nthe Americas (Lugones 2007: 190). Decolonial feminists such as Lugones\nand Wynter bring poststructuralist critique in dialogue with Latin\nAmerican philosophy and argue that dominant gender arrangements\nthemselves are colonial; these arrangements, such as patriarchy,\nheterosexualism, or gender dimorphism mark concrete historical\nprocesses of the racial inscription of gender norms, starting from and\nwith the coloniality of power (Lugones 2008; Oyěwùmí\n2007; Wynter 2006). \nDecolonial feminisms’ emphasis on historical critique is\ninseparable from a concern with the concrete lived experiences of\nwomen of color (Moraga and Anzaldúa 1981 [2015]; Pérez\n1999; Lugones 2007, Sandoval 2000). Gloria Anzaldúa, in\nBorderlands/La Frontera, emphasizes bordered thinking as the\nunderlying logic of contemporary systems of oppression, and she\nformulates the resistances of hybrid identities that emerge both out\nof and in response to such bordered thinking (Anzaldúa 1987).\nMariana Ortega develops Latina feminist phenomenology in emphasizing\nboth the lived experience of borderlands and exile, and the\npossibilities of resistance by developing “home-tactics”\nin and through these experiences (Ortega 2016). \nCoalitional thinking is a fundamental aspect of both post- and\ndecolonial feminist approaches. Mohanty calls for coalitions across\nborders in thinking through the concrete lived experiences and\nemphasizes the importance of situated and local struggles in\nunderstanding hegemonic power relations.  Moraga and Anzaldúa,\nin their coedited collection This Bridge Called My Back, call\nfor concrete and sustained coalitions that are based on an\nintersectional understanding of women’s lives, rather than\nabstract calls for sisterhood. Decolonial feminists such as Lugones,\nChela Sandoval, Ortega, and Emma Pérez, maintain that\ncoalitional thinking cannot be an afterthought for any anti- or\ndecolonial struggles (Pérez 1999; Sandoval 2000). \nAs Continental feminism expands, it involves further conversations\nwith and in-between these approaches. The questions around the\n“continent” of Continental feminism, as well as how such a\ncontinent is situated within the colonial geographic boundaries of the\nWest and the Global North, continue to be challenged. As spaces for\nsuch a flow of ideas open up, further conversations on the possibility\nof coalition, as well as on challenging the limits of colonial thought\ncontinue to reshape the face of Continental feminism. \nThe relationship between Continental feminism and queer theory is\nsimultaneously productive and fraught. While far from exhaustive, this\nentry will first highlight some of the overlapping figures and\napproaches between the two fields, including examples of scholarship\nat their intersections. It will then briefly introduce one account of\nthe tension between them. Finally, it will close with some reflections\non the shared problems across these fields, including their\nhistorically white and Anglo-Eurocentric approaches, as well as how\nrecent work in queer of color critique aligns with and points to new\ndirections in Continental feminism. \nIn the late 1980s and the early 1990s, “queer” emerged as\na reclamation of a homophobic slur and a rallying cry for a coalition\nof the marginalized against the tyranny of the normal (Barker &\nScheele 2016; D. Hall & Jagose 2012; Warner 1993; Sedgwick 1993;\nAnzaldúa 1991 [2009]). Formed in the crucible of the AIDS\ncrisis, which sharpened the need to understand the violence\nexperienced by people excluded by norms related to gender and\nsexuality, “queer” was meant to bring attention to the\nrange of sexual/gender practices deemed outside the purview of the\nnormal. In one genealogy of queer theory, the field develops this\nearly activist reclamation of the term queer into a wide-reaching\ncritique of how norms operate in and through dominant\nconceptualizations of identity. Given this motivating impulse of\ndeconstruction, or of denaturalizing categories such as sexuality, it\nis perhaps of no surprise that queer theory has historically been a\nfield well-populated with figures (e.g., Lacan, Foucault, Derrida) and\nmethodological approaches (poststructuralism, psychoanalysis,\nphenomenology) that have been associated with Continental philosophy,\nespecially twentieth century European philosophy. \nQueer theory frequently draws on, critiques, and expands the ideas of\nmany figures and approaches that are seen as early progenitors of\nContinental feminism (e.g., Beauvoir, Irigaray, Kristeva, feminist\nphenomenology, feminist poststructuralism, critical theory,\npsychoanalytic theory). As Jagose (2009) points out, however, the\ncritique of normative identity categories was not invented by queer\ntheory, given that feminist scholarship has a rich history of\nradically disrupting the category of women along lines of race and\nsexuality. Moreover, the lines between feminism and queer theory are\nhistorically blurred. For example, Judith Butler—who is often\ncited as an originator of queer theory—explicitly marks her\nearly work as occurring in the intersection of these fields (as well\nas a number of other critical discourses) (1997). In Gender\nTrouble (1990) and Bodies that Matter (1993), Butler\ndraws on Continental feminist figures such as Irigaray, Beauvoir, and\nKristeva, and methods ranging from psychoanalysis to poststructuralism\nand phenomenology to develop a simultaneously queer and feminist\ntheoretical lens focused on understanding the relationship between\ngender and sexuality, as well as the operation of norms and identity\ncategories more broadly (Salih 2002). \nA second major figure in the relationship between Continental feminism\nand queer theory is Michel Foucault, who has been extensively used in\nboth queer and Continental (and specifically poststructuralist)\nfeminist theory, but who (as opposed to Butler) did not explicitly use\nthe terms queer and feminist. While a larger account of the connection\nbetween Foucault and queer theory is beyond the scope of this entry,\nthe relationship is a rich one. In the late 1980s, Foucault’s\nThe History of Sexuality, Volume One was read\nheavily by activists and scholars questioning dominant narratives\naround sexuality and identity (Halperin 1995); Foucault’s work\nwas also influential not only for Judith Butler’s Gender\nTrouble (1990) but also for another text often cited as\nfoundational for queer theory, Eve Sedgwick’s Epistemology\nof the Closet (1990 [2008]). \nFoucault’s genealogical approach to identity, including his\nexploration of the histories and models of power at work in modern\nconceptions of sexuality, has been important for a number of\ncontemporary scholars working at the intersections of feminism and\nqueer theory (Huffer 2010 and 2020; Russell 2010; Sawicki 2005;\nSchotten 2018; Winnubst 2006). For example, Ladelle McWhorter (1999)\ntakes up Foucault’s account of ethics as a practice of the self,\nor how we work on ourselves to become particular kinds of people,\nthrough a queer framework that resists expected developmental\ntrajectories and normative timelines of a life (e.g., heterosexual\ncoupling resulting in marriage and children). And in a different vein,\nJasbir Puar (2007) has drawn on Foucault’s theories of power (as\nwell as a wide range of interdisciplinary theory including\npostcolonial feminist theory) to analyze the relationship between\ncontemporary biopower and homonationalism, or how certain\n“good” gay and lesbian subjects, by aligning themselves\nwith U.S. imperialism, are welcomed into the nation-state. \nFigures associated with Continental feminism who do not necessarily\nmark themselves or their work as queer have also been used in queer\ntheoretical projects, just as feminists have historically done with\nany number of non-feminist philosophers. For example, queer studies\nscholars have explored the relative absence of Irigaray in queer\ntheory, argued for the queer resources of her thinking (Huffer 2013;\nWinnubst 2006), called attention to the potential use of\nIrigaray’s disruption of binaries for queer analyses of identity\n(Butler 1993: 36–39; Grosz 1989), and used Irigarayan concepts\nto develop queer analyses of longstanding feminist issues, such as the\nexperience of breast feeding (R. Lee 2018). \nPhenomenological methods can also track this traffic between\nContinental feminism and queer theory. For example, Sara Ahmed’s\nQueer Phenomenology (2006) explores the use of phenomenology\nin queer studies by asking, among other questions, how to understand\nthe “orientation” of sexual orientation as the way bodies\nare directed towards particular objects and away from others. In\ndeveloping this queer use of phenomenology, Ahmed acknowledges her\ndebt to feminist philosophers of the body such as Sandra Bartky, Iris\nMarion Young, Rosalyn Diprose, and Gail Weiss, as well as early\nphenomenologists such as de Beauvoir and phenomenologists of race\nincluding Linda Alcoff, Frantz Fanon, and Lewis Gordon. \nGiven these examples of the overlap of figures and approaches in\nContinental feminism and queer theory, it is worth asking what\ndistinguishes the approaches. One may be tempted to say that feminism\nfocuses more on gender (historically, within continental feminism,\nthis may be more commonly discussed as sexual difference) and queer\ntheory focuses more on sexuality (including questions of pleasure,\ndesire, and eroticism). Yet many working within Continental feminism,\nespecially as inflected with French theory, also focus on questions\nrelated to sexuality such as pleasure, desire, and eroticism. And\nthere are also reasons to be suspicious of how the gender-sexuality\nsplit is narrated as a feminist-queer split. While some have argued\nthat there are good reasons to draw distinctions between these fields\nin order to do justice to their distinct concerns (G. Rubin 2011;\nHalley 2006), there have also been many challenges to overly\nprogrammatic forms of this separation (Huffer 2013) and accounts of\nhow this narrative can overlook the field’s mutual interest in\nunderstanding the complex relationship between gender and sexuality,\nas well as the possibility of a queer feminism (Jagose 2009).\nNevertheless, despite the overlaps in figures and archives, as well as\nthe wealth of resources in queer theory on topics that Continental\nfeminist philosophers hold dear (temporality, embodiment, identity,\nand desire, to name only a few), the relatively slow uptake of texts\nmarked explicitly as queer theory has been noticeable (Winnubst 2010).\nThis is not to erase the important work done at the intersections of\nthese fields but to acknowledge that the relationship is not a\nseamless one. In their introductory comments to a “Roundtable on\nContinental Feminism”, Lynne Huffer and Shannon Winnubst (2017)\nnote the relative lack of engagement with queer theory among the\ncontributions, and they ask whether Continental feminism is capacious\nenough to embrace queer theory, a question that has also been posed to\nphilosophy more broadly (Ahmed 2016b; Salamon 2009; Winnubst\n2010). \nFinally, both Continental feminism and queer theory have also been\nextensively critiqued for the whiteness and Anglo-Eurocentric nature\nof their archives. In one particularly well-known rendition of this\ncritique, Cathy Cohen asks whether queer theory has lived up to its\nanti-identitarian promise of creating coalitions across difference\n(2005). As a way to intervene in the whiteness of queer theory\n(Johnson and Henderson 2005), Roderick Ferguson (2004) coined the\nterm “queer of color critique” to describe how various\nintersections of race, gender, sexuality, and class operate in\nnationalistic discourses of identity and belonging; it is, in\nFerguson’s words, \na heterogenous enterprise made up of women of color feminism,\nmaterialist analysis, poststructuralist theory, and queer critique.\n(Ferguson 2004: 149) \nOther notable and early contributors to this sub-field include\nJosé Muñoz, E. Patrick Johnson, Chandan Reddy, and\nGayatri Gopinath. Although the topics at work in queer of color\ncritique concerning identity, embodiment, temporality, and affect have\nalso been topics of central interests to Continental feminists, the\nuptake of queer of color critique, as with queer theory, has been slow\nin Continental feminism. However, as Continental feminism\nexpands—as shown through this entry— the resources of\nqueer theory and queer of color critique are waiting in the wings as\ncrucial, if at times under acknowledged, interlocutors. \nLike Continental feminism, queer theory and queer of color critique\ncontinue the longstanding feminist tradition of sending texts and\nideas in directions they were perhaps never intended to travel. Recent\ntrajectories at the crossroads of Continental feminism and queer\nstudies include attention to neoliberal capitalism (Winnubst 2015;\nMcWhorter 2012), sex and gender in ancient Greek metaphysics (Bianchi\n2014); critical disability theory (Puar 2017; K. Hall 2014; Yergeau\n2018; and Gallop 2019), Latina feminism and existential phenomenology\n(Ortega 2016), affect and temporality (Ahmed 2019; Amin 2017; Freeman\n2019), and materialism and concepts of agency (Chen 2012). As explored\nin the next section, another important interlocutor with both\nContinental feminism and queer theory is transgender studies. \nA number of scholars have noted the complex interplay of shared and\ndistinct concerns between trans, feminist, and queer frameworks\n(Namaste 1996 and 2009; Prosser 1998; Heyes 2003; Salamon 2010a;\nStryker 2004). Emerging in the 1990s as a distinct field of academic\ninquiry, trans studies shares many of the intellectual roots of queer\ntheory yet also departs from queer studies through its explicit focus\non trans experience, including both non-monolithic nature of that\nexperience and the importance of trans people speaking for themselves\nabout their own lives. Likewise, while many of the theoretical\nframeworks and figures at the heart of Continental feminism are\npresent in trans studies (e.g., post-structuralism, phenomenology,\nFoucauldian genealogy, materialism), there have also been important\ncritiques of how Continental feminist approaches can ignore or\nsideline trans experience. Significantly, many of the philosophers\nworking in Continental feminism and trans studies cited in this entry\ncross inter- and intra-disciplinary boundaries. \nIn exploring the relationship between Continental feminist and trans\nstudies, it is crucial to acknowledge the forms that transphobia and\ntrans-exclusionary gestures can assume in feminist discourse more\ngenerally. For an extended overview of this history, see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on trans issues.\n The entry explains points of terminology (trans, transgender, trans*,\ntranssexual), as well as the historical emergence of transgender\nstudies and the broader (i.e., non-Continental specific) relationship\nbetween feminist and trans issues. \nIn one widely recognized form of feminist transphobia (found in the\nwork of trans-exclusionary radical feminists such as Janice Raymond),\ntrans women are portrayed as not “real” women and as\nthreats to feminist movements (Bettcher 2006, 2007; McKinnon 2018).\nHowever, there is another strand of feminist theory that has a\ndistinct relationship to trans issues, and (importantly for present\npurposes) it is a lineage of feminism that draws heavily on\nContinental figures such as Butler. While there is no doubt that\nButler’s work has been foundational in trans studies as well as\nin queer theory (Gerdes 2014; Salah 2007), it is also the case that\nher work has been critiqued for its selective use of trans experience\n(Prosser 1998; Namaste 1996; H. Rubin 1998). Critics point out that\ntrans identity tends be affirmed in Butlerian queer feminist discourse\nwhen it can be used to demonstrate the actual constructedness of\ngender, or its lack of ontological necessity, but also that some trans\nidentity is portrayed as problematically essentialist when accompanied\nby claims to “really be” a man or a woman and/or demands\nfor medical transition (Valentine 2012). While Prosser and Rubin both\ncritique this rejection of claims to gender realness from a\nphenomenological perspective (and Prosser (1998) from a psychoanalytic\nframework as well), Namaste (1996) focuses on the institutional\nreality of gender that is often sidelined in these debates. In\nresponse, Jack Halberstam has argued that, while Prosser’s\nfrustration with a selective use of trans identity in queer and\nfeminist theory is understandable, there are still significant\nproblems with the normativity inherent in the idea of gendered\nrealness (2005). \nNotably, the proliferation of non-trans feminist writers working on\ntrans issues in the 1990s led to Jacob Hale’s “Suggested\nRules for Non-Transsexuals Writing about Transsexuals, Transsexuality,\nTranssexualism, or Trans” (1997\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n Significant non-trans feminist analyses, following Hale and the\nemergence of transgender studies, include work by Cressida Heyes\n(2003) and Naomi Scheman (1996, 2016), both of whom articulate\ntheoretical bases for solidarity between cis and trans feminists.\nThere are also important instances of cis feminist theorists bringing\ntrans issues directly into their own work as serious interlocutors,\nrather than as thought experiments (Ahmed 2016b; Colebrook 2015;\nShotwell & Sangrey 2008) and collaborating with trans theorists\n(Heyes & Latham 2018). The term “cis” itself has also\nreceived more scholarly attention in the last two decades (Aultman\n2014). While the original intention behind the term was to\ndenaturalize non-trans subject positions, not all scholars agree that\nthe term successfully destabilizes gender norms, particularly insofar\nas such norms are racialized (Enke 2012b). \nMore recently, there have been many new trajectories established at\nthe crossroads of Continental and trans approaches to gender. A number\nof philosophers have written at the intersections of phenomenology and\ntrans studies, particularly in critical phenomenology, which\nemphasizes questions of oppression and power in examining how things\nappear to us in the world (Weiss, Murphy, & Salamon 2020). Ephraim\nDas Janssen uses phenomenology, including the work of Martin\nHeidegger, to examine what transgender experience tells us about\ngender (2017). Megan Burke (2019) takes up Beauvoirian concepts to\nexplore androgyny, trans identity, and agender experience. Gayle\nSalamon draws on the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to develop a\nphenomenology of transphobia in The Life and Death of Latisha\nKing (2018a). Salamon merges a tradition of earlier work in\nphenomenology and trans studies (H. Rubin 1998; Prosser 1998) with\ncritical phenomenology. Tamsin Kimoto (2018) has also used both\nMerleau-Ponty and Frantz Fanon to explore hormonal transition and\ntransphobia. \nAlong similar lines, new work in psychoanalysis and trans studies is\nalso revising longstanding psychoanalytic approaches to sex and\ngender, including coercive and pathologizing theories of trans\nsubjectivity (Elliot 2014), and is using resources in psychoanalysis\nto theorize trans experiences from a less pathologizing perspective\n(Breslow 2017; Carlson 2010; Coffman 2017; Cavanagh 2010). For\nexample, Amy Ray Stewart uses Julia Kristeva’s concept of\n“intimate revolt” to illuminate trans and queer\nexperiences of psychic life (2017). Patricia Gherovici (2017) has\nwritten about trans phenomena and the need to revise psychoanalytic\nconcepts using Lacanian theory and her own clinical experience working\nwith trans people. Relying on both psychoanalytic and phenomenological\nframeworks, Salamon (2010a) has also defended Butler’s account\nof gender against the aforementioned critiques of its treatment of\ntrans experience and developed her own psychoanalytic and\nphenomenological account of a dissonance between a felt sense of\ngender and an external appearance of a body that is attuned to trans\nexperience. \nThere is also a body of work emerging that puts foundational figures\nin Continental feminism into conversation with trans studies. Marie\nDraz (2018) has placed feminist philosophical uses of Nietzsche, such\nas in the work of Butler (1990) and Rosalyn Diprose (2002), into\nconversation with trans scholarship on the institutionalization of\ngender categories, while Tim Johnston (2015) has argued that although\nscholars of gender and sexuality have used Irigarayan resources for\ndiscussing trans and queer issues, Irigaray’s own claim that\nontology is sexed and that there is an impassable limit between the\nsexes conveys an unsalvageable cissexism, or privileging of non-trans\nexperience. In a similar vein, Oli Stephano (2019) critiques Elizabeth\nGrosz’s emphasis on the irreducibility of sexual difference,\nshowing that her ontology invalidates trans embodiment and\nsubjectivities. This critique of Grosz follows earlier work by Eva\nHayward (2017) on the transphobic implications of some of\nGrosz’s feminist materialist arguments. Gayle Salamon also\ncritically examines the way that sexual difference operates as a limit\nto the reimagining of embodiment and materiality in the work of both\nIrigaray and Grosz (Salamon 2010a). María Lugones is another\nfigure of widespread use in Continental feminism who has been\nregularly cited in scholarship on trans issues (Bettcher 2014b;\nDiPietro 2019; Draz 2017a; Malatino 2019). Finally, like Butler, the\nuse of Foucault in trans studies has also changed dramatically over\nthe last several decades. For example, Foucault’s work on types\nof modern power has been used (alongside women of color feminism,\nindigenous scholarship, and numerous other sources) to examine the\nviolence caused by how state institutions administer legal gender\ncategories in sex-segregated institutions and identity documents\n(Spade 2011 [2015]). Foucauldian feminist accounts of prison and\npunishment have also been put into conversation with scholarship\nrooted in trans and gender non-conforming experience (Dilts 2017;\nVitulli 2018; Zurn 2016, 2019). \nTrans studies continues, in different veins, many of the foundational\nquestions of Continental feminism by bringing the tools of Continental\nphilosophy to bear on questions of sex, gender, and sexuality, and\nvice versa, and it continually orients these conversations in new\ndirections. Much of this work is informed by other areas of critical\ntheory (e.g., critical race theory and decolonial theory) and pushes\nthe traditional boundaries of Continental feminism. Recent scholarship\non blackness and trans history, for example, has articulated the\nimportance of developing frameworks capable of understanding the\ndimensions of racialized gender historically and today (Snorton 2017)\nand work on migration and Latinx trans people has highlighted the need\nto attend to both the limits of our political theory and the\nproductive capacities of trans people of color for generating new\nworlds (Pitts 2018). Current conversations about the relationship\nbetween Continental feminism and trans studies must also involve\nattention to the material conditions of the academy itself, as the\ngrowing attention to trans experience in philosophy more broadly has\nnot resulted in more trans voices and trans academics (Bettcher 2018\n(Other Internet Resources); Marvin 2019, 2020). Future directions in\nContinental feminism and trans studies will need to be attentive not\nonly to the intriguing philosophical questions occurring in these\nconversations, but also to the specific contours of the material\nconditions that allow trans scholarship to flourish. \nThis section explores the relationship between Continental feminism\nand Asian American feminist thought, both the tensions between the two\nas well as new directions that this relation brings to Continental\nfeminism. A major point of convergence between the two fields is the\nfocus on lived experience of Asian American women. This section begins\nby discussing the hypervisibility that Asian American women experience\ndue to the specific forms of oppression that they face, namely,\norientalization and the Model Minority myth. It then highlights the\nparadoxical form of invisibility that Asian American feminist\nphenomenologist trace in their body of work. Next, this section\nconsiders the historical position of Asian American women in\ncoalitional feminist projects, especially focusing on the ways in\nwhich Asian American women have been relegated to a\n“tag-along” group. Finally, this section will highlight\nrecent scholarship in Continental feminism that engages with Asian\nAmerican feminist theory and draws upon both Eastern and Western\ntraditions. \nIt must be noted from the outset that “Asian” is an\nexceptionally broad term, and the peoples that are considered\nAsian/Asian American have often changed throughout history. In\naccordance with anthologies by Asian American women that respond to\nthis very issue, this section addresses the identities of women who\ntrace their roots back to East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian\nsubcontinent (Asian Women United of California 1989; The Women of\nSouth Asian Descent Collective 1993). \nIn This Bridge Called My Back (Moraga & Anzaldúa\n1981 [2015]), Asian American thinkers such as Genny Lim, Merle Woo, Nellie\nWong, and Mitsuye Yamada established their positions in feminist\ntheorizing by exploring their own perspectives on topics surrounding\ngendered identity, sexuality, silencing, the feeling of not-belonging,\nand living against stereotypes of Asian American women as docile,\nquiet, agreeable, and submissive. Similarly, in This Bridge We\nCall Home (Anzaldúa & Keating 2002), Minh-ha T. Pham,\nShirley Geok-Lin Lim, and Jid Lee theorize from the specific\nexperiences that they face as Asian American immigrant women, such as\nexploring a connection to an Asian mother who emigrated to the United\nStates, navigating the cultural connection they still hold to a land\nthat they may have never visited, and living in the face of the Model\nMinority myth while also subverting the stereotype. Writings that\ncenter the perspective of the Asian American and diasporic Asian woman\nare essential for Asian American feminist theorizing, for, as Sonia\nShah emphasized, \n[a]n Asian American feminist movement is the only movement\nthat will consistently represent Asian American women’s\ninterests. (1998: xix) \nTwo early anthologies were very important for the formation of Asian\nAmerican feminism: Making Waves (Asian Women United of\nCalifornia [AWUC] 1989) and The Forbidden Stitch (Lim &\nTsutakawa 1989); they both include writings from different ethnic and\nnational backgrounds, specifically Chinese, Japanese, Filipino,\nKorean, Vietnamese, and Indian (Hill-Collins & Bilge 2016: 73). In\na recent volume entitled Asian American Feminisms and Women of\nColor Politics, editors Lynn Fujiwara and Shireen Roshanravan\npresent a series of articles emerging at the intersection of Asian\nAmerican feminist engagement with Women of Color coalition politics,\norganizing around concepts, methods, and epistemic principles central\nto Women of Color feminist scholarship (Fujiwara & Roshanravan\n2018) \nHypervisibility of Asian American women is a central issue in most\nAsian American feminist projects. Some Asian American feminist\ntheorists, such as Robin Zheng, argue that Asian American women are\nhypervisible because they are hypersexualized, orientalized, and\nexoticized. Robin Zheng (2016) discusses the complexities of\nhypervisibility “Why Yellow Fever Isn’t Flattering: A Case\nAgainst Racial Fetishes”. Zheng argues that there is little\ndifference between what is known as “yellow fever”, the\nracial fetishization and preference of Asian women and men, and what\nshe calls the “Mere Preference Argument”, which attempts\nto claim that there is nothing morally wrong with preferring certain\nracialized phenotypic traits; as she shows, despite the origin of a\nracialized fetish, both yellow fever and other racialized fetishes\n“depersonalize and otherize” their subjects (2016: 412).\nZheng shows that these fetishes are not just harmless personal\npreferences, but a set of practices and thought patterns that result\nin negative social impacts for Asian American women. Relatedly, Asian\nAmerican women are also hypervisible due to the “Model Minority\nmyth”, that is, the myth that asserts that Asian Americans are\nuniquely hard-working and thus, the ideal “model”\nminority, especially in contrast with other minority groups. This myth\nmakes Asian American women hypervisible by making them a part of a\ngroup of people who are defined by their ability to achieve upward\nclass mobility (K. Lee 2014). \nParadoxically, Asian American women are also rendered invisible in\nvarious feminist movements and discourses. Asian American feminist\ndiscussions on invisibility differ from other discussions within\nContinental feminism on visibility and feminine erasure due to their\ndual existence as both invisible subjects and hypervisible\nrepresentations of stereotypes. Poet and activist Mitsuye Yamada\nstates that Asian American women are “the visible minority that\nis invisible” (1981b). Yamada means this claim in two ways:\nfirst, in regard to how Asian American women are rendered invisible in\nconversations surrounding women of color oppressions; and second, in\nregard to how the oppressions experienced by Asian American women are\noften invisible to themselves. In order to carve out a space for\nthemselves in feminist theorizing, Asian American women in this book\nshared their stories that demonstrate the struggle of becoming visible\nto oneself while existing in a world that constantly demands\none’s invisibility. Yamada’s explains how she was\ninvisible to herself because she practiced passive resistance while\nbelieving that others did not see her as the stereotype of an Asian\nAmerican women. In order to become visible to herself and others, she\nrealized that she must act in ways, such as displaying anger in\nresponse to sexist and racist acts, that an oppressive gaze would\nclaim was “uncharacteristic” of her as an Asian American\nwoman (1981b: 40). At the same time, the Model Minority myth can also\nparadoxically render Asian American women invisible by making them\nhypervisible as successful paradigms that are perceived as lacking\nexperiences of oppression and violence and thus have no credibility to\nspeak to these lived experiences. \nAs a result of this specific form of invisibility, Asian American\nfeminists proposed new methods of political organization in order to\ninclude the voices of Asian American women in feminist coalitions. The\nsimilarities between writings that span nearly two decades gesture to\none of the many issues faced by Asian American feminism: Asian\nAmerican feminists have often been seen, and arguably still are seen,\nas a group in the background that is simply, as Yamada described,\n“tagging along” in feminist theorization against\noppressions (1981b: 40). In other words, Asian American women are\noften seen as individuals who do not often experience oppressions that\nare specific to their own identities and, therefore, have no place in\nfighting oppression. In response to this, we can see activists such as\nGrace Lee Boggs, who have worked closely with other people of color in\nthe fight against different oppressions (Boggs & Boggs 1974; 1998\n[2016]; Boggs & Kurashige 2011); Lisa Lowe’s essay on\nheterogeneity, hybridity, and multipolicy of Asian American\nwomen’s experiences (Lowe 1991); and more recent Asian American\nfeminist projects that include Asian Americans women in liberatory\nprojects in a manner that does not simply relegate them to tag-along\npositions (Shah 1998; Fujiwara & Roshanravan, 2018). \nA growing number of recent works in Asian American feminism engage\nwith figures and themes in Continental feminism through the framework\nEastern philosophy and the Asian American women’s perspective\nand as such they provide new directions for a genuinely\ntransContinental feminism. For example, building on the discussions\nconcerning gender in Continental feminisms, thinkers such as Kyoo Lee\n(2014) and Robin Wang (2016) have explored different ways that the\ngendered body has been discussed. Engaging with the concept of the\n“dark female animal” (xuapin) in\nDaodejing, Kyoo Lee explores the revolutionary potential of\nxuapin, which she claims possesses a gender-bending power.\nLee argues that xuapin demonstrates \nin a sense, superiority of femaleness and femininity –as\nthe norm, albeit invisible and inaudible \nand that it is \ngender-bending: female and not female at once, heterosexualized and\nnot at once. (K. Lee 2014: 59) \nWang investigates yin-yang gender dynamics through a variety of both\nEastern and Western sources in order to answer whether yin-yang gender\nconstruction allows for gender equality. Alluding to Continental\nfeminists who wrote on gender such as Simone de Beauvoir, Judith\nButler, and Luce Irigaray, Wang discusses an exploration of gender\nthrough a Chinese framework (the yin-yang) that does not make a clear\ndistinction between sex and gender. Wang argues that yin-yang gender\nconstruction offers a dynamic and fluid description of gender\nrelationships (Wang 2016: 224). \nThis entry has listed a number of ways in which Continental approaches\nand figures are used to address feminist issues; we have attempted\nboth to describe some of the ongoing research areas in Continental\nfeminism and to point out new directions it has been taking over the\npast decades. However, this list remains incomplete as we have been\nunable to account for all of the important work underway. A more\ncomplete entry would need to include projects on the intersection\nbetween Continental feminism and critical disability studies,\nindigenous feminisms, and new materialisms and humanisms. Furthermore,\nwe do not mean to suggest that there is no overlap or intersection\nbetween the topics or figures grouped under each section heading here.\nLastly, there is certainly ongoing work of which we are not aware that\nis already making an impact on the present and future of feminist\nscholarship. We thus conclude here not with a summative statement\ndefining Continental feminism but rather by reflecting on the material\nconditions of Continental feminism. \nWhen Linda Martín Alcoff addressed the Eastern American\nPhilosophical Association in 2012, she reflected on the tension and\nissues within disciplinary philosophy and urged philosophers to\n“apply our diagnostic impulses to ourselves” (Alcoff 2013:\n43). A necessary aspect of such praxis for Continental feminists in\nlight of the genealogies considered here is exemplified by Audre Lorde\nwho, speaking on the “Personal is Political Panel” at the\nSecond Sex Conference in 1979, stated \nI urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of\nknowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any\ndifference that lives there. See whose face it wears. (Lorde 1984a:\n101) \nLorde calls feminists to enact a humble and frank confrontation with\ntheir own embodied lives and senses of self in the context of each\nperson’s differential implication in racist, sexist,\nheterosexist, classist and ableist power. Rather than imagining that\none puts on one’s thinking hat and reflects “as a\ntheorist” and then take it off and acts “as a regular\nperson”, Continental feminisms suggest that the subject who\ntheorizes is themself always an embodied subject: Kris Sealey reminds\nus that “Continental methods oftentimes refract differently\nacross race and gender axes” and that for this reason,\nContinental feminists ought “to be intentional about the\nrelationship they occupy, quite simultaneously, to racial and gender\nliberation” (Sealey 2017: 166). As this entry has shown, the\ndiversity of Continental feminist thought has been developed through\nthe thoughtful negotiation of many different struggles. For the\nimagined community of Continental feminism to continue to grow and\nsupport these projects, space must continually be made for new\npractitioners. Since, as we put above, Continental feminism is less\nconcerned with changing a woman’s place in a symbolic or social\nsystem, and more on upending that system itself, members of this\nacademic community must continue to do the work that will make it\npossible to learn from each other. Only in this way Continental\nfeminism can be opened up fully to its interdisciplinary\npotential.","contact.mail":"ebrown43@villanova.edu","contact.domain":"villanova.edu"}]
