As in so many other cases, he sets the agenda for the\nsubsequent tradition. And yet understanding his remarks about each of\nthese topics—rhetoric and poetry—presents us with\nsignificant philosophical and interpretive challenges. Further, it is\nnot initially clear why he links the two topics together so closely\n(he suggests that poetry is a kind of rhetoric). Plato certainly\nthought that matters of the greatest importance hang in the balance,\nas is clear from the famous statement that “there is an old\nquarrel between philosophy and poetry” (Republic,\n607b5–6). In his dialogues, both this quarrel and the related\nquarrel between philosophy and rhetoric amount to clashes between\ncomprehensive world-views—those of philosophy on the one hand,\nand of poetry or rhetoric on the other. What are these quarrels about?\nWhat does Plato mean by “poetry” and\n“rhetoric”? The purpose of this article is to analyze his\ndiscussions of rhetoric and poetry as they are presented in four\ndialogues: the Ion, the Republic, the\nGorgias, and the Phaedrus. Plato is (perhaps\nparadoxically) known for the poetic and rhetorical qualities of his own\nwritings, a fact which will also be discussed in what follows. \n\nWhen we think of a philosophical analysis of poetry, something like a\ntreatise on aesthetics comes to mind. At a minimum, we would expect a\nrigorous examination of the following: the characteristics that define\npoetry; the differences between kinds of poetry (epic, tragic, lyric,\ncomic, and so forth); and the senses in which poetry is and is not\nbound to representation, imitation, expression (which are possible\nmeanings of the classical Greek word “mimesis”) and\n fiction.[2]\n These complicated terms themselves require careful definition.\nEqually rigorous and systematic remarks about the differences between\npoetry and other art forms, such as music and painting, would be in\norder, as would reflection on the relation between orally delivered\npoetry (indeed, if we are to include performance, poetry that is in\none way or another enacted) and poetry communicated through the\nwritten word. Aristotle’s Poetics is an early, and now\nclassic, philosophical exploration of poetry along these sorts of\nlines. \nPlato’s extensive discussions of poetry frustrate these expectations.\nHe did not write a treatise on the subject—indeed, he wrote no\ntreatises, and confined his thought to “dramatic”\ndialogues that are themselves shaped poetically—and the remarks\nhe offers us both meander unsystematically, even within a single\ndialogue, and branch off in what seem like strange directions, such as\ninto discussions about the corruption of self to which poetry\nallegedly exposes its audience. And yet Plato clearly thought that\nsomething of enormous importance hangs on his assessment of poetry,\nsomething that goes significantly beyond getting the details of the\nsubject pinned down in a philosophically respectable fashion. One of\nthe most famous lines in the culminating sections of one of his most\nfamous dialogues announces that “there is an old quarrel between\nphilosophy and poetry” (Rep. 607b5–6), in support\nof which Plato quotes bits of several obscure but furious\npolemics—presumably directed by poets against\nphilosophers—such as the accusation that the opponent is a\n“yelping bitch shrieking at her master” and “great\nin the empty eloquence of fools”.\n [3]\n Indeed, much of the final book of the Republic is an attack\non poetry, and there is no question but that a quarrel between\nphilosophy and poetry is a continuing theme throughout Plato’s\ncorpus. \nThe scope of the quarrel, especially in the Republic, also\nindicates that for Plato what is at stake is a clash between what we\nmight call comprehensive world-views; it seems that matters of grave\nimportance in ethics, politics, metaphysics, theology, and\nepistemology are at stake. He leads up to the famous line about the\nquarrel by identifying the addressees of his critique as the\n“praisers of Homer who say that this poet educated Greece, and\nthat in the management and education of human affairs it is worthwhile\nto take him up for study and for living, by arranging one’s whole life\naccording to this poet” (606e1–5). The praisers of Homer\ntreat him as the font of wisdom. Plato agrees that Homer is indeed the\neducator of Greece, and immediately adds that Homer is “the most\npoetic and first of the tragic poets.”  Plato is setting\nhimself against what he takes to be the entire outlook—in\ncontemporary but not Plato’s parlance, the entire “philosophy of\nlife”—he believes Homer and his followers have\nsuccessfully propagated. And since Homer shaped the popular culture of\nthe times, Plato is setting himself against popular culture as he knew\nit. Not just that: the quarrel is not simply between philosophy and\nHomer, but philosophy and poetry. Plato has in his sights all of\n“poetry,” contending that its influence is pervasive and\noften harmful, and that its premises about nature and the divine are\nmistaken. He is addressing not just fans of Homer but fans of the sort\nof thing that Homer does and conveys. The critique is presented as a\ntrans-historical one. It seems that Plato was the first to articulate\nthe quarrel in so sweeping a\n fashion.[4] \n It is noteworthy that in the Apology (23e), Socrates’\naccusers are said to include the poets, whose cause Meletus\nrepresents. \nIt is not easy to understand what Plato means by poetry, why it is an\nopponent, whether it is dangerous because of its form or content or\nboth, and whether there is much of ongoing interest or relevance in\nhis account. Would his critique apply to, say, Shakespeare’s\ntragedies? To E. E. Cummings’ or T. S. Eliot’s poetry? These questions\nare complicated by the fact that Plato was not (or, not primarily)\nthinking of poetry as a written text read in silence; he had in mind\nrecitations or performances, often experienced in the context of\ntheater. Still further, when Socrates and Plato conducted their\ninquiries, poetry was far more influential than what Plato calls\n“philosophy.” Given the resounding success of Plato’s\nadvocacy of “philosophy,” it is very easy to forget that\nat the time he was advocating a (historically) new project in a\ncontext swirling with controversy about the relative value of such\nprojects (and indeed about what “philosophy” means). By\ncontrast, poetry seems relatively marginal in today’s large commercial\nand liberal societies, in spite of the energetic efforts of figures\nsuch as the recent American national Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky,\nwhereas media of which Plato knew nothing—such as television,\nvideos, and the cinema, literary forms such as the novel, and\ninformation systems such as the World Wide Web—exercise\ntremendous influence. Television and movie actors enjoy a degree of\nstatus and wealth in modern society that transcends anything known in\nthe ancient world. Is Plato’s critique marginalized along with\npoetry? \nIn spite of the harshness, and in some ways the bluntness of Plato’s\ncritique of poetry, he not only put his finger on deep issues of\nongoing interest, but also leavened his polemic in a number of\nintriguing and subtle ways—most obviously, by writing philosophy\nin a way that can, with proper qualifications, itself be called\npoetic. The “quarrel between philosophy and poetry” is\njustly famed and pondered: what is it about? \nWhen we turn to the second theme under consideration, viz., rhetoric,\nwe find ourselves even more puzzled initially. What do philosophers\nhave to say about rhetoric?  Generally speaking, very little\nqua philosophers. Like all reflective people, philosophers\ndislike rhetoric as it is commonly practiced, bemoan the decline of\npublic speech into mere persuasion and demagoguery, and generally\nthink of themselves as avoiding rhetoric in favor of careful analysis\nand argument. “Rhetoric” tends to have a very negative\nconnotation, and for the most part means “mere\nrhetoric.”  As an object of academic study, the subject of\nrhetoric seems best left to English professors who specialize in the\nlong history of manuals on techniques of persuasion and such.\nConsequently, philosophers, especially in modernity, have had little\nto say about rhetoric. By contrast, Aristotle devoted a book to the\ntopic. And Plato struggles with rhetoric—or sophistry as it is\nsometimes also called, although the two are not necessarily\nidentical—repeatedly. We recall that Socrates was put to death\nin part because he was suspected of being a sophist, a clever\nrhetorician who twists words and makes the weaker argument into the\nstronger and teaches others to do the\n same.[5] \n Plato’s polemic against the sophists was so persuasive that, in\nconjunction with a well established and ongoing popular hostility\ntowards sophistry (a hostility of which Socrates was, ironically, also\nthe object), we have come to use “sophist” as a term of\nopprobrium meaning something like “mere rhetorician.” In\nPlato’s dialogues there is unquestionably an ongoing quarrel between\nphilosophy on the one hand and rhetoric and sophistry on the other,\nand it too is justly famed and pondered. What is it about? \nOnce again, the question is surprisingly difficult. It is not easy to\nunderstand why the topic is so important to Plato, what the essential\nissues in the quarrel are, and whether rhetoric is always a bad thing.\nWe do recognize commendable examples of rhetoric—say, Pericles’\nFuneral Oration, Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, or Churchill’s rousing\nspeeches during World War II. These were rhetorical, but were they\nmerely rhetorical, let alone sophistical? Still further, Plato’s\nSocrates is not above speaking to his interlocutors rhetorically at\ntimes, even sophistically (some of his arguments against Thrasymachus\nin book I of the Republic have been suspected of falling into\nthe latter category, and Socrates’ interlocutors are occasionally\nreported as feeling that he has played some kind of verbal trick on\nthem). And are not Plato’s dialogues themselves rhetorical in\nsignificant senses of the term? \nThese remarks prompt yet another question. However interesting the\ntopics of poetry and rhetoric may be, when we read Plato, why group\nthem together? Few people today would imagine that there is any\ninteresting relation between poetry and rhetoric. To think of great\npoets as “rhetoricians” seems bizarre; and most (popular)\nrhetoricians do not seem to know the first thing about poetry. Yet\nPlato himself associates the two very closely: at Gorgias\n502c he characterizes poetry as a kind of rhetoric. Thus Plato\nprovides our warrant for investigating the topics together. This\nlinkage between poetry and rhetoric is of course controversial, and\nwill be discussed below. \nQuite clearly, our themes are very large in scope, and indeed nearly\nevery one of Plato’s dialogues is relevant to one or more of them. The\npresent essay will confine itself to just four dialogues, the\nIon, Republic, Gorgias, and\nPhaedrus. I will discuss them in that order, and in the final\nsection of the essay shall briefly examine the famous question of the\npoetic and rhetorical dimension of Plato’s own writings. \nI shall look for connections between our four dialogues, though I do\nnot believe that our chosen texts present a picture of poetry and\nrhetoric that is altogether unified (indeed, this could not be claimed\neven of the Republic taken by itself). I will put aside the\nquestion about which dialogue Plato composed at which time, along with\nassumptions about the possible “development” of Plato’s\nviews from “earlier” to “later” dialogues.\nThis is an example of an interpretive (or as it is sometimes called, a\n“hermeneutical”) assumption; every reader of Plato\nnecessarily commits to interpretive assumptions. The debate about\nwhich assumptions are best is an ongoing one, but not germane to the\npresent\n discussion.[6]\n It suffices here to state the relevant assumptions made in this\ndiscussion. \nThe identity of “Socrates” is contested; we have no\nwritings by the historical figure, only writings by a number of\nauthors that in some sense or other—and the senses vary a great\ndeal—are either about him or creatively adapt his name and\naspects of his story. In referring to Socrates, I shall mean only the\nfigure as represented by Plato; nothing follows, for present purposes,\nabout the historical accuracy of Plato’s depiction. Further, it is not\nthe case that the views Plato puts into the mouth of his Socrates are\nnecessarily espoused by Plato himself; they may or may not be those of\nPlato. Since Plato did not write a treatise in his own voice, telling\nus what his views are, it is impossible to know with certainty which\nviews he espouses (at least on the basis of the works he composed). In\nseveral cases, one of which will be examined in the final section of\nthis essay, it seems reasonably clear that Plato cannot be\nespousing without qualification a view that his Socrates is endorsing.\nWith these principles firmly in mind, however, I shall occasionally\nrefer (as I already have) to Plato as presenting this or that view.\nFor as author of all the statements and drama of the\ndialogues, he does indeed present the views in question; and on\noccasion it is convenient and simpler to say he is advocating this or\nthat position (for example, the position that there is an ancient\nquarrel between philosophy and poetry). \nIon is a prize-winning professional reciter of poetry—a\n“rhapsode”—and of Homer in\n particular.[7]\n Though he speaks his lines with the requisite conviction and emotion,\nhe does not “imitate” his subjects in the sense of act\ntheir parts (of course, Homer did not write for the stage). He is a\nperformer but not a (stage) actor. Ion is depicted as superb at making\nthe Iliad and Odyssey come alive, at communicating\ntheir drama to his audience and at involving them intimately. We might\nsay that he “represents” or “expresses” the\ncharacters, action, and narrative of Homer’s epic poems, and thus in\nsome sense both identifies with his subject and leads his audience to\ndo the same. As he puts it in the dialogue that bears his name: if he\nhas done his job well, he will find himself weeping when reciting\nsorrowful lines, and expects to see his audience weep along with him\n(535b1–e6). Both are somehow transported, thanks to Ion’s superb\nnarrative capacity, into the original scene (as Socrates says, Ion is\n“beside himself” and in the enthusiasm of the moment\nthinks he is present at the scene he is describing; 535b7–c3). \nBut Ion thinks himself capable of yet more, for he also claims to be\nan expert in explaining what Homer means. He’s an exegete (see 531a7)\nor interpreter par excellence, and this claim especially intrigues\nSocrates. He does not permit Ion to actually exhibit his skills as a\nrhapsode, and instead insists that he engage in give-and-take about\nthe abilities Ion claims to possess. This is typical of Socrates’\nmethod; he forces his interlocutor to give an account of his\ncommitments and way of life. As both reciter and exegete, the rhapsode\nhas no exact analogue today. Nonetheless, the implications of the\nIon are broad; while Ion is not a poet himself, he bears\nimportant traits in common with the poet. \nThe thrust of Socrates’ initial questioning is revealing. Essentially,\nhe attempts to show that Ion is committed to several theses that are\nnot compatible with one another, unless a rather peculiar, saving\nassumption is introduced. Ion claims that he is a first rate\nexplicator of Homer; that he is a first rate explicator only\nof Homer, and loses interest as well as competence if another poet\n(such as Hesiod) is brought up (531a3–4, 532b8–c2;\n533c4–8); and that Homer discusses his subjects much better than\ndo any other poets (531d4–11, 532a4–8). Ion may justly be\nthought of as one of the “praisers” of Homer referred to\nin Republic X (see above, and Ion 542b4). Notice\nthat Socrates’s first order of business is to get Ion to agree that a\nnumber of claims are being made by him; while this may seem\nobvious, it is an essential condition for Socrates’ inquiry, and is a\ndistinctive characteristic of the sort of thing Socrates does as a\nphilosopher. \nIf Ion is an exegete or explicator of Homer’s poems, he must surely\nunderstand what the poet means, else he could not explain the poet’s\nthoughts. This seemingly commonsensical point is asserted by Socrates\nat the start (530c1–5), and happily accepted by Ion. However, if\nIon understands what the poet says about X, and judges that\nthe poet speaks best about X, he must be in a position to\nassess other poets’ pronouncements about the subject in question. For\nexample, Homer talks a great deal about how war is waged; as an expert\non Homer who claims that Homer spoke beautifully about that subject\n(in the sense of got it right), Ion must be in a position to explain\njust how Homer got it right and how Hesiod, say, got it wrong, as a\nseries of simple analogies show. If you can knowledgeably\n(531e10) pick out a good speaker on a subject, you can also pick out\nthe bad speaker on it, since the precondition of doing the former is\nthat you have knowledge of the relevant subject matter. But this seems\nto contradict Ion’s assertion that he can explain only Homer, not the\nother poets. \nLet us recapitulate, since the steps Socrates is taking are so\nimportant for his critique of poetry (it is noteworthy that at several\njunctures, Socrates generalizes his results from epic to dithyrambic,\nencomiastic, iambic, and lyric poetry; 533e5–534a7,\n534b7–c7). To interpret Homer well, we have to understand what\nHomer said; to do that, and to support our judgment that he spoke\nsuperlatively well, we have to understand the subject matter about\nwhich Homer speaks (just as we would in, say, evaluating someone’s\npronouncements about health). Further, Homer himself must have\nunderstood well that about which he speaks. As interpreters or\nassessors, we are claiming to be experts judging a claim (in this case\nHomer’s) to expertise, just as though we were members of a medical\nexamination board considering an application to the profession. So as\ninterpreters we are making claims about the truth of Homer’s teachings\nabout XYZ; and thus we are assuming that Homer sought to\nstate the truth about XYZ. Given that he discusses the\ncentral topics of human and godly life (531c1–d2), it would seem that\nHomer claims to be wise, and that as his devoted encomiasts we too\nmust be claiming to be wise (532d6–e1). But claims to wisdom are\nsubject to counter-claims (the poets disagree with each other, as\nSocrates points out); and in order to adjudicate between them, as well\nas support our assessment of their relative merits, we must open\nourselves to informed discussion both technical and philosophical.\nTechnical, because on subjects such as (say) war-making, the general\nshould be consulted about the accuracy of Homer’s description thereof;\nphilosophical because both the method of assessing the whole (the\n“Socratic method”) and the comprehensive claims about the\ntruth made by interpreter and poet, are properly philosophical\npreoccupations for Plato. \nIt is but a step from there to the proposition that neither Ion nor\nHomer can sustain their claims to knowledge, and therefore could not\nsustain the claim that the poems are fine and beautiful works. In\npassage after passage, Homer pronounces on subjects that are the\nprovince of a specialized techne (art or skill), that is, a\nspecialized branch of knowledge. But neither the rhapsode nor Homer\npossesses knowledge of all (or indeed perhaps any) of those\nspecialized branches (generalship, chariot making, medicine,\nnavigation, divination, agriculture, fishing, horsemanship, cow\nherding, cithara playing, wool working, etc.). Ion attempts to resist\nthis by claiming that thanks to his study of Homer, he knows what a\ngeneral (for example) should say (540d5). Since he has accepted that\nthis would involve possessing the art of generalship (541e2,\ntechne kai episteme), his claim is patently indefensible, and\nSocrates charges that he has failed to make good on his assertion to\nbe “wonderfully wise … about Homer” (542a1). \nSo Ion, and by extension Homer, are faced with a series of unpalatable\nalternatives: \n(b.1) one would amount to saying that while lacking in technical\nknowledge (knowledge of this or that craft or skill), they do have\nknowledge of human affairs—something like knowledge of human\nnature, of how human life tends to go, of the relation between (say)\nvirtue and happiness, as well as of the natures of both virtue and\nhappiness. To this might be added the claim that the poets and their\nexponents know the nature of the cosmos and of the divine. In the\nRepublic Socrates in effect allows them comprehensive claims\nto knowledge along those lines, and then attacks across the board,\nseeking to show that the poets have got it wrong on all important\ncounts. \n(b.2) alternatively, they could admit that they do not have either\ntechnical or non-technical knowledge of any of the topics about which\nthey sing; rather, they possess the skill (techne) of\ncreating beautiful, persuasive, and moving images of the subjects in\nquestion. So when Ion claims that Homer speaks beautifully about X, he\njust means that Homer speaks beautifully in a rhetorical sense even\nthough he (Homer) does not necessarily know what he is talking about.\nBy extension, poets would (on this interpretation) make the same\nclaim about themselves. That would seem to reduce them to rhetoricians,\nwhich in effect is what Socrates argues in the Gorgias, with\nthe further proviso that rhetoric as popularly practiced is not even a\ntechne. Poetry-as-mere-rhetoric is not a promising credential\nfor authority either to educate all of Greece or to better one’s\naudience; (b.2) is not a position that poets or their rhapsodes would,\npresumably, be eager to adopt. \n(b.3) Ion could admit that he knows nothing about the topics Homer\naddresses, withdrawing his claim to be a knowledgeable exegete, but\nmaintain that Homer himself knows what he’s talking about. Ion would\nbe liable to the question as to how he knows all that,\nhowever; and in any case would at best shift Socrates’ attack to the\nreal target, viz. Homer. \n(b.4) Socrates provides a seemingly more palatable alternative in the\nIon, one that is echoed in the Phaedrus (245a); this\nis the “peculiar, saving assumption” mentioned above. It\nconsists in the thesis that Ion recites (and Homer composes) not from\nknowledge but from divine inspiration. Neither knows what he\nis saying, but is nonetheless capable of speaking or composing\nbeautifully thanks to the divine. They are like the worshippers of\nBacchus, out of their right minds (534b4–6). This creative\nmadness, as we might call it, they share with other Muse-inspired\nartists as well as prophets and diviners (534b7–d1). This is supposed\nto explain why Ion can recite only Homer beautifully; he’s been\ndivinely inspired only in that area, and that is all he means when he\nsays that Homer is better than his rival poets. Ion has no\nargument to support what looks like a comparative assessment;\nit is just a report to the effect that he is “possessed”\nby Homer’s magic thanks to the work of a god. A poet, further, is not\na knower, but a kind of transmitter of a divine spark; he or she is\n“an airy thing, winged and holy” (534b3–4). The\nspark is generated by the god, and is passed down through the poet to\nthe rhapsode and then to the audience. In Socrates’ unforgettable\nsimile, the relationship of the god to poet to rhapsode to audience is\nlike a magnetized sequence of rings, each of which sticks to the next\nthanks to the power of the divine magnet at the start\n(535e7–536b4), as though they were links in a chain (as we might\nput it). \nThis simile helps to answer an important question: why should we care\nwhether or not the poets know what they are talking about, if we enjoy\ntheir compositions? Socrates’ answer is that as the last link on this\nchain of inspiration, we are capable of being deeply affected by\npoetry. We “spectators” at the recital too lose our minds,\nto some degree, weeping or laughing as we enter into the narrated\nscene, seemingly forgetting our real selves and lives (535b2–d9). In\nthe Ion he doesn’t offer a further explanation of how this\neffect is supposed to happen—for that, we will turn to the\nRepublic—but the important point is that it does\nhappen. It would seem that the audience is transformed by the\nexperience in a way that momentarily takes them out of themselves.\nPerhaps it does not leave them as they were, for their understanding\nof what properly elicits their grief or their laughter would seem to\nbe shaped by this powerful experience, an experience they presumably\nrepeat many times throughout childhood and beyond. Perhaps they too\nstart to believe—as Ion and possibly the poet do—that they\n“know” something thanks to their contact with the divine,\nsuch as how war is to be conducted and for what ends, what fidelity in\nlove means, or the character of the gods. None of this would matter\nmuch if superb poetry left us unmoved, or in any case as we were.\nPlato’s critique depends on the assumption that poetry can and does\nshape the soul. \nThe “divine inspiration” thesis resolves some problems for\nIon (and implicitly for Homer) while postponing others. One problem is\nindicated by the last few lines of the dialogue, where Socrates offers\nIon a choice: either be human, and take responsibility for unfairly\navoiding his questions about the nature of his (Ion’s) wisdom; or\naccept the label “divine” and subscribe to the inspiration\nthesis. Ion chooses the latter on grounds that it is\n“lovelier.” It is an invitation to hybris, of course. How\neasy it would be to confuse divine and human madness (to borrow a\ndistinction from the Phaedrus 244a5–245c4)! And not all\nof the contenders for the prize Ion has won could be equally worthy of\npromotion to divine status. By contrast, Socrates characterizes\nhimself in the Apology as not thinking he knows what he does\nnot know, as possessing human rather than divine\n “wisdom.”[8]\n Finally, since the poets and their rhapsodes both present views about\nhow things are and ought to be, and seek to persuade their auditors of\nthe same, they cannot escape responsibility for the implicit claim to\nwisdom and authority they make. For Plato, this means that they must\nbe held accountable. It is philosophy’s mission to force them to give\nan account of themselves, and to examine its soundness. This would\nmean that they are required to engage philosophy on its turf, just as\nIon has somewhat reluctantly done. The legitimacy of that requirement\nis itself a point of contention, it is one aspect of the quarrel\nbetween philosophy and\n poetry.[9] \nIn order to respond to the famous challenge put to Socrates by Glaucon\nand Adeimantus, it is necessary to define justice. Socrates suggests\nthat the task would be easier if justice were first sought in a polis,\nwhere it is “writ large.” That strategy accepted, the\npolis must be created in speech. It turns out that philosophic\nguardians are to rule the polis, and the next question concerns their\neducation (376e2). The critique of poetry in the Republic\ngrows out of a consideration of the proper education (from their\nchildhood on) of the philosopher-guardians in the “city in\nspeech.” The context for the critique is therefore that of the\nspecific project of the Republic, and this raises a question\nas to whether the critique is meant to hold whether or not the\n“city in speech” is possible or desirable. \nThe concern in book II is very much with the proper education of a\ncitizen, as befits the project of creating a model city. The\n“myth makers” (377b11; Bloom translates “makers of\ntales”) who supply the governing stories of the day are like\npainters (377e2) who make pictures of heroes and gods, and indeed of\nthe relations both among and between the two. From the outset,\nSocrates treats the poems (those by Hesiod and Homer are singled out,\nbut the critique isn’t meant to be confined to them) as though they\ncontained not just falsehoods, but falsehoods held up as models of\ngood behavior. The poems are taken as educational and thus broadly\npolitical texts; persuasion (see 378c7) of a class of the young is\nvery much at stake. The young cannot judge well what is true and\nfalse; since a view of things taken on at early age is very hard to\neradicate or change, it is necessary to ensure that they hear only\nmyths that encourage true virtue (378d7–e3). The pedagogic motivation\nin question certainly extends beyond the specific “city in\nspeech” the Republic creates. Thus while the critique\nof poetry in book II and beyond is in this sense shaped by the\ncontextual concerns, it is not limited to them. \nFurther, Socrates takes aim at the content of several\nparticularly influential poems, and his arguments against that content\ndo not depend, here, on the project of creating the “best\ncity.” One of his first targets is what he calls their\n“theology” (379a5–6). Whether in epics, lyrics or\ntragedies, whether in meter or not (379a8–9, 380c1–2), god\nmust be described accurately, and that turns out to be as unchanging;\nas good and the cause of only good; as incapable of violence; and as\n“altogether simple and true in deed and speech,” for god\n“doesn’t himself change or deceive others by illusions,\nspeeches, or the sending of signs either in waking or dreaming”\n(382e8–11). For “there is no lying poet in a god”\n(382d9). In short, the gods accurately conceived are remarkably\nsimilar to what Socrates will subsequently call, in Republic\nV-VII, the “Ideas.” Quite obviously, the dominant\n“theological” foundation of the world-view prevalent in\nfourth and fifth century Greece—and also any theological view\nthat does not meet the strictures Socrates specifies—must be\nabandoned. The scope of the critique is breathtaking. \nAlong the way Socrates makes yet another point of great importance,\nnamely that the poets ought not be permitted to say that those\npunished for misdeeds are wretched; rather, they must say that in\npaying a (just) penalty, bad men are benefited by the god\n(380b2–6). Socrates is starting to push against the theses that\nbad people will flourish or that good people can be harmed. The cosmos\nis structured in such a way as to support virtue. Socrates is\nattempting to undermine what one might call a “tragic”\nworld view (note that in book X, he characterizes Homer as the\n“leader” of tragedy; 598d8). \nIn book III Socrates expands the argument considerably. The concern\nnow is squarely with poetry that encourages virtue in the souls of the\nyoung. Courage and moderation are the first two virtues considered\nhere; the psychological and ethical effects of poetry are now\nscrutinized. The entire portrait of Hades must go, since it is neither\ntrue nor beneficial for auditors who must become fearless in the face\nof death. Death is not the worst thing there is, and all depictions of\nfamous or (allegedly) good men wailing and lamenting their misfortunes\nmust go (or at least, be confined to unimportant women and to bad men;\n387e9–388a3). The poets must not imitate (see 388c3 for the\nterm) gods or men suffering any extremes of emotion, including\nhilarity, for the strong souls are not overpowered by any emotion, let\nalong any bodily desire. Nor do they suffer from spiritual conflict\n(391c). The rejection of the “tragic” world view becomes\nexplicit: neither poets nor prose writers should be allowed to say\nthat “many happy men are unjust, and many wretched ones just,\nand that doing injustice is profitable if one gets away with it, but\njustice is someone else’s good and one’s own loss.” Anybody\npronouncing on any of these topics—poetically or not—must\nsay the opposite (392a13–b6). In expanding the scope of the relevant\ndiscourse so broadly, Socrates in effect lays down requirements for\nall persuasive discourse—for what he elsewhere calls\n“rhetoric”—and makes poetry a subsection\nthereof. \nHaving covered the issue of content, Socrates turns to the\n“style” (“lexis,” 392c6), or as we might say,\nof the “form” of myth tellers or poets (Socrates again\nruns these two together). He does so in a way that marks a new\ndirection in the conversation. The issue turns out to be of deep\nethical import, because it concerns the way in which poetry\naffects the soul. Up until now, the mechanism, so to speak, has been\nvague; now it becomes a little bit clearer. Poetic myth tellers convey\ntheir thought through a narrative (diegesis) that is either\n“simple” (haplos) or imitative (that is,\naccomplished through “mimesis”). The notion of\nmimesis, missing from the Ion, now takes center\nstage. When the poet speaks in his own voice, the narrative is\n“simple”; when he speaks through a character, as it were\nconcealing himself behind the mask of one of his literary creations,\nthe narrative is imitative or mimetic. For then the poet is likening\nhimself to this character, and trying to make the audience believe\nthat it’s the character speaking. Some poetry (comedy and tragedy are\nmentioned) proceeds wholly by imitation, another wholly by simple\nnarration (dithyrambs are mentioned), and epic poetry combines the two\nforms of narrative. \nWhat follows this classificatory scheme is a polemic against\nimitation. The initial thesis is that every person can do a fine job\nin just one activity only. Consequently, nobody can do a fine job of\nimitating more than one thing (for example, an actor cannot be a\nrhapsode, a comic poet cannot be a tragic poet, if any of these is\nfinely done). Imitation is itself something one does, and so one\ncannot both imitate X (say, generalship) well and also do the activity\nX in question (394e-395b). It has to be said that this thesis is set\nout with little real argument. In any case, the best souls (the\nguardians, in this case, in the city in speech) ought not imitate\nanything. \nAnd were they to imitate anything, every care must be taken that they\nare ennobled rather than degraded as a result. Why? If imitations\n“are practiced continually from youth onwards,” they\n“become established as habits and nature, in body and sounds and\nin thought” (395d1–3). Unlike simple narrative, mimesis\nposes a particular psychic danger, because as the speaker of the\nnarrative one may take on the character of literary persona in\nquestion. It is as though the fictionality of the persona is\nforgotten; in acting out a part one acts the part, and then one begins\nto act (in “real life”) as the character would act. One\ndoes not actually take oneself to be the fictional character;\nrather, the “model” or pattern of response or sentiment or\nthought one has acted out when “imitating” the character\nbecomes enacted. There is no airtight barrier between throwing\nyourself (especially habitually) into a certain part, body and soul,\nand being molded by the part; no firm boundary, in that sense, between\nwhat happens on and off the stage. By contrast, Socrates argues, a\nsimple narration preserves distance between narrator and narrated. \nBefore passing onto critiques of music and gymnastic, Socrates\nconcludes this section of his critique of poetry with the stipulation\nthat a poet who imitates all things (both good and bad) in all styles\ncannot be admitted into the good\n polis.[10]\n However, a more “austere” poet and myth teller is\nadmissible, for he confines himself to imitating decent people (when\nhe imitates at all, presumably as infrequently as possible), thus\nspeaking pretty much in the same tone and rhythm, and who accurately\nrepresents the nature of the gods, heroes, virtue, and other issues\ndiscussed in books II and III\n (398a1–b4).[11] \nThis critique of mimetic poetry has struck not a few readers as a bit\nstrange and obtuse, even putting aside the question of the legitimacy\nof censorship of the arts. It seems not to distinguish between the\npoet, the reciter of the poem, and the audience; no spectatorial\ndistance is allowed to the audience; and the author is allowed little\ndistance from the characters he is representing. All become the\nspeakers or performers of the poem when they say or think the lines;\nand speaking the poem, taking it on as it were, is alleged to have\nreal effects on one’s dispositions. \nIn book II the critique of poetry focused on mimesis understood as\nrepresentation; the fundamental point was that poets misrepresent the\nnature of the subjects about which they write (e.g., the gods). They\ndo not produce a true likeness of their topics. In book III, the focus\nshifts to mimesis understood as what one commentator has called\n“impersonation”; participating in the\n“imitation” by taking on the characters imitated was\nviewed as corrupting in all but a few cases of poetic\n mimesis.[12]\n Surprisingly, in book X Socrates turns back to the critique of\npoetry; even more surprisingly, he not only mischaracterizes the\nresults of the earlier discussion (at 595a5 he claims that all of\npoetry that was imitative was banished, whereas only part of it was\nbanished; 398a1–b4), but recasts the critique in very different terms.\nThis is due in part to the fact that the intervening discussion has\nseen the introduction of the “theory of Forms,” a more\nelaborate analysis of the nature of the soul, and a detailed\ndescription of the nature of philosophy. The renewed criticism leads\nup to the famous statement that there exists an ancient quarrel\nbetween poetry and philosophy. \nBook X starts us off with a reaffirmation of a main deficiency of\npoets: their products “maim the thought of those who hear\nthem.” And by means of the following schema, this is now\nconnected to a development of the allegation (repeated at\n602b6–8) that poets do not know what they are talking about.\nSocrates posits that there are Forms (or Ideas) of beds and tables,\nthe maker of which is a god; there are imitations thereof, namely beds\nand tables, produced by craftsmen (such as carpenters) who behold the\nForms (as though they were looking at blueprints); thirdly, there are\nimitators of the products of the craftsmen, who, like painters, create\na kind of image of these objects in the world of becoming. The\ntripartite schema presents the interpreter with many\n problems.[13]\n Certainly, Socrates does not literally mean that poets paint verbal\npictures of beds and tables. Subsequently, the scheme is elaborated so\nas to replace the craftsmen with those who produce opinion in the city\n(legislators, educators, military commanders, among others), and the\npainters with “the first teacher and leader of all these fine\ntragic things” (595b10–c2), that is, Homer. The poets are\ntherefore “at the third generation from nature” or\n“third from a king and the truth” (597e3–4,\n6–7). \nLet us focus on one of the implications of this schema, about which\nSocrates is quite specific. The poets don’t know the originals of\n(i.e., the truth about) the topics about which they discourse; they\nappear to be ignorant of that fact; and even worse, just as a\ntrompe-l’oeil painting can deceive the naïve onlooker\ninto believing that the imitation is the original, so too\nthose who take in poetry believe they are being given truth. Imitation\nnow starts to take on the sense of\n “counterfeit.”[14]\n Unequipped to put claims to knowledge to the test, the audience buys\ninto the comprehensive picture of “all arts and all things human\nthat have to do with virtue and vice, and the divine things too”\nthat the poet so persuasively articulates (598b-599a). The fundamental\npoint is by now familiar to us: “For it is necessary that the\ngood poet, if he is going to make fair poems about the things his\npoetry concerns, be in possession of knowledge when he makes his\npoems” (598e3–5). Even putting aside all of the matters\nrelating to arts and crafts (technai such as medicine), and\nfocusing on the greatest and most important things—above all,\nthe governance of societies and the education of a human\nbeing—Homer simply does not stand up to examination (599c-600e).\nAll those “skilled in making” (tous poietikous),\nalong with this educator of Greece and leader of the tragic poets, are\npainted as “imitators of phantoms of virtue and of the other\nsubjects of their making” (600e4–6). \nAnd what, apart from their own ignorance of the truth, governs their\nvery partial perspective on the world of becoming? Socrates implies\nthat they pander to their audience, to the hoi polloi\n(602b3–4). This links them to the rhetoricians as Socrates\ndescribes them in the Gorgias. At the same time, they take\nadvantage of that part in us the hoi polloi are governed by;\nhere Socrates attempts to bring his discussion of psychology,\npresented since book III, to bear. The ensuing discussion is\nremarkable in the way in which it elaborates on these theses. \nThe example which introduces the last stage of Socrates’ critique of\npoetry prior to the famous announcement of the “quarrel”\nis that of deep human suffering; specifically, a parent’s loss of a\nchild (603e3–5). How would a decent person respond to such a\ncalamity? He would fight the pain, hold out against it as much as\npossible, not let himself be seen when in pain, would be ashamed to\nmake a scene, and would “keep as quiet as possible”\nknowing that none of “the human things” is “worthy of great\nseriousness.” Being in pain impedes the rule of reason, which\ndictates that when we are dealt misfortunes, we must be as unaffected\nby them as possible, preserving the harmony of our souls (603e-604e).\nSocrates sketches the character of the decent and good person this\nway: “the prudent and quiet character, which is always nearly\nequal to itself, is neither easily imitated nor, when imitated, easily\nunderstood, especially by a festive assembly where all sorts of human\nbeings are gathered in a theater. For imitation is of a condition that\nis surely alien to them” (604e). This may be a sketch of\nSocrates himself, whose imitation Plato has\n produced.[15] \nBy contrast, the tragic imitators excel at portraying the psychic\nconflicts of people who are suffering and who do not even attempt to\nrespond philosophically. Since their audience consists of people whose\nown selves are in that sort of condition too, imitators and audience\nare locked into a sort of mutually reinforcing picture of the human\ncondition. Both are captured by that part of themselves given to the\nnon-rational or irrational; both are most interested in the condition\nof internal conflict. The poet “awakens this part of the soul\nand nourishes it,” producing a disordered psychic regime or\nconstitution (politeia, 605b7–8; compare this language\nto that of the passages at the end of book IX of the\nRepublic). The “childish” part of the soul that\nrevels in the poet’s pictures cannot distinguish truth from reality;\nit uncritically grants the poet’s authority to tell it like it is.\nOnlookers become emotively involved in the poet’s drama. \nAnother remarkable passage follows: “Listen and consider. When\neven the best of us hear Homer or any other of the tragic poets\nimitating one of the heroes in mourning and making quite an extended\nspeech with lamentation, or, if you like, singing and beating his\nbreast, you know that we enjoy it and that we give ourselves over to\nfollowing the imitation; suffering along [‘sympaschontes’,\na word related to another Greek word, ‘sympatheia’] with\nthe hero in all seriousness, we praise as a good poet the man who most\nputs us in this state” (605c10–d5). So the danger posed by\npoetry is great, for it appeals to something to which even the\nbest—the most philosophical—are liable, and induces a\ndream-like, uncritical state in which we lose ourselves in the\nemotions in question (above all, in sorrow, grief, anger,\nresentment). \nAs one commentator aptly puts it, “on the one hand, poetry\npromotes intrapsychic conflict; on the other, it keeps us unconscious\nof that conflict, for the irrational part of our psyche cannot hear\nreason’s corrections. That is why poetry, with its throbbing rhythms\nand beating of breasts, appeals equally to the nondescript mob in the\ntheater and to the best among us. But if poetry goes straight to the\nlower part of the psyche, that is where it must come\n from.”[16]\n Further, the picture of the gods that the Greek poets painted was a\nprojection of the tumultuous and conflictual lower parts of the soul,\none which in turn gave sustenance and power to those very same parts\nof the soul. \nThe worry, then, is that in experiencing the emotions\nvicariously—by identifying, so to speak, with the drama—we\nrelease emotions better regulated by reason, and become captive to\nthem in “real” life. In a psychological sense, drama\nsupplies what today we would call “role models.” Socrates’\npoint is not that we think the drama is itself real, as though we\ncannot distinguish between what takes place on and off the stage; but\nthat “the enjoyment of other people’s sufferings has a necessary\neffect on one’s own.” Why? “For the pitying part [of the\nsoul], fed strong on these examples, is not easily held down in one’s\nown sufferings”\n (606b).[17]\n And this applies to comedy as well; we get used to hearing shameful\nthings in comic imitation, stop feeling ashamed at them, and indeed\nbegin to enjoy them\n (606c).[18]\n Socrates quite explicitly is denying that aesthetic\n“pleasure” (606b4) can be insulated from the ethical\neffects of poetry. To put the point with a slight risk of anachronism\n(since Plato does not have a term corresponding to our\n“aesthetics”), he does not think that aesthetics is\nseparable from ethics. He does not separate knowledge of beauty and\nknowledge of good. It is as though the pleasure we take in the\nrepresentation of sorrow on the stage will—because it is\npleasure in that which the representation represents (and not just a\nrepresentation on the stage or in a poem)—transmute\ninto pleasure in the expression of sorrow in life. And that is not\nonly an ethical effect, but a bad one, for Plato. These are\ningredients of his disagreements on the subject with Aristotle, as\nwell as with myriad thinkers since\n then.[19]\n He is asserting, though without filling out the psychological\nmechanisms in the detail for which one would wish, that from childhood\nup, mimesis shapes our images and our fantasies, our unconscious or\nsemi-conscious pictures and feelings, and thereby shapes our\ncharacters, especially that part of our nature prone to what he thinks\nof as irrational or non-rational. \nThe poets help enslave even the best of us to the lower parts of our\nsoul; and just insofar as they do so, they must be kept out of any\ncommunity that wishes to be free and virtuous. Famously, or\nnotoriously, Plato refuses to countenance a firm separation between\nthe private and the public, between the virtue of the one and the\nregulation of the other. What goes on in the theater, in your home, in\nyour fantasy life, are connected. Poetry unregulated by philosophy is\na danger to soul and\n community.[20] \nThe argument in book X cuts across all forms of “poetry,”\nwhether tragic, comic, lyric, in meter or not; indeed, the earlier\ndistinction between imitative and narrative poetry too seems\nirrelevant here. The conclusion is the same: “We are, at all\nevents, aware that such poetry mustn’t be taken seriously as a serious\nthing laying hold of truth, but that the man who hears it must be\ncareful, fearing for the regime in himself, and must hold what we have\nsaid about poetry” (608a6–b2). So sweeping a conclusion makes\nmany assumptions, of course, one of which is that there is such as\nthing as “truth” out there, and the theory of Forms or\nIdeas is part of the metaphysical foundation of that view. The poets\nhave been characterized as making claims to truth, to telling it like\nit is, that are in fact—contrary to appearances—little\nmore than the poet’s unargued imaginative projections whose tenability\nis established by their ability to command the applause of the\naudience. That is, the poets are rhetoricians who are, as it were,\nselling their products to as large a market as possible, in the hope\nof gaining repute and influence. \nThe tripartite schema of Idea, artifact, and imitator is as much about\nmaking as it is about imitation. Making is a continual thread\nthrough all three levels of the schema. The Ideas too are said to be\nmade, even though that is entirely inconsistent with the\ndoctrine of Ideas as eternal expressed earlier in the\nRepublic itself (and in all the other Platonic dialogues).\nThe suggestion is arguably that the poets are makers (see also\n599a2–3, where we are told that poets “produce\nappearances,” as one might translate), that they move in a world\npermeated by making. The word “poetry” in Platonic Greek\ncomes from the word “to make” (poiein), a fact\nupon which Socrates remarks in the\n Symposium.[21]\n Making takes place in and contributes to the world of becoming.\nPhilosophers, by contrast, are presented as committed to the pursuit\nof truth that is already “out there,” independently of the\nmind and the world of becoming. Their effort has to do with discovery\nrather than making. Thus stated the contrast is crude, since poets\nalso reflect what they take their audience to (want to) feel or\nbelieve—they “imitate” in the sense of represent as\nwell as express—and philosophers make speeches and (as Socrates\nhimself says) they too\n imitate.[22]\n Nonetheless, the distinction suggests an interesting possibility,\nviz. that the quarrel between poetry and philosophy is finally, in\nPlato’s eyes, about the relative priority of making and discovery. The\nmaking/discovery distinction chimes with a number of the dichotomies\nupon which we have touched: imagination vs. reason, emotion vs.\nprinciple, becoming vs. being, artifacts vs. Forms, images vs.\noriginals. \nNowhere in the Republic does Socrates mention the poet’s\nclaim to inspiration. Indeed, that claim is pointedly omitted in the\npassage in which Socrates talks about the beginnings of the\nIliad (392e2–393a5; see Bloom’s note ad loc).\nSocrates implicitly denies the soundness of that claim here. Given his\nconception of the divine as Idea, such a claim could not be true,\nsince the Ideas do not speak, let alone speak the things which Homer,\nHesiod, and their followers recount. The result is that the poets are\nfabricators even of the appearance of knowing what they are talking\nabout; this is not inconsistent with the Ion’s\ncharacterization of poetry as inspired ignorance. \nDoes the critique of poetry in the Republic extend beyond the\nproject of founding the just city in speech? I have already suggested\nan affirmative answer when discussing book II. The concerns about\npoetry expressed in books III and X would also extend beyond the\nimmediate project of the dialogue, if they carry any water at all,\neven though the targets Plato names are of course taken from his own\ntimes. It has been argued that the authority to speak truth that poets\nclaim is shared by many widely esteemed poets since\n then.[23]\n It has also been argued that the debate about the effects on the\naudience of poetry continues, except that today it is not so much\npoets strictly speaking, but the makers of others sorts of images in\nthe “mass media,” who are the culprits. Controversies\nabout, say, the effects of graphic depictions of violence, of the\ndegradation of women, and of sex, echo the Platonic worries about the\nethical and social effects of art. At least in cases such as these, we\nretain Plato’s skepticism about the notion of “aesthetic\n distance.”[24] \nThe Gorgias is one of Plato’s most bitter dialogues in that\nthe exchanges are at times full of anger, of uncompromising\ndisagreement, plenty of misunderstanding, and cutting rhetoric. In\nthese respects it goes beyond even the Protagoras, a dialogue\nthat depicts a hostile confrontation between Socrates and the renowned\nsophist by the same\n name.[25]\n The quarrel between philosophy and rhetoric shows itself as an ugly\nfight in the Gorgias. \nWhat is the fight about? Socrates asks Gorgias to define what it is\nthat he does, that is, to define rhetoric. And he asks him to do it in\na way that helps to distinguish rhetorical from philosophical\ndiscourse: the former produces speeches of praise and blame, the\nlatter answers questions through the give and take of discussion\n(dialegesthai, 448d10) in an effort to arrive at a concise\ndefinition, and more broadly, with the intent to understand the\nsubject. The philosopher is happy to be refuted if that leads to\nbetter understanding; wisdom, and not just striving to\n“win” the argument, is the goal (457e-458a). \nGorgias is forced by successive challenges to move from the view that\nrhetoric is concerned with words (speeches) to the view that its\nactivity and effectiveness happen only in and through words (unlike\nthe manual arts) to the view that its object is the greatest of human\nconcerns, namely freedom. Rhetoric is “the source of freedom for\nhumankind itself and at the same time it is for each person the source\nof rule over others in one’s own city” (452d6–8). This\nfreedom is a kind of power produced by the ability to persuade others\nto do one’s bidding; “rhetoric is a producer of persuasion. Its\nwhole business comes to that, and that’s the long and short of\nit” (453a2–3). But persuasion about what exactly? Gorgias’\nanswer is: about matters concerning justice and injustice (454b7). But\nsurely there are two kinds of persuasion, one that instills beliefs\nmerely, and another that produces knowledge; it is the former only\nwith which rhetoric is concerned. The analogy of this argument to the\ncritique of poetry is already clear; in both cases, Socrates wants to\nargue that the speaker is not a truth speaker, and does not convey\nknowledge to his audience. As already noted, Socrates classifies\npoetry (dithyrambic and tragic poetry are named) as a species of\nrhetoric. Its goal is to gratify and please the spectator, or\ndifferently put, it is just a kind of flattery. Strip away the rhythm\nand meter, and you have plain prose directed at the mob. It’s a kind\nof public speaking, that’s all (502a6–c12). \nThe rhetorician is a maker of beliefs in the souls of his auditors\n(455a3–4). And without that skill—here Gorgias begins to\nwax at length and eloquently—other arts (such as medicine)\ncannot do their work effectively (456b ff.). Rhetoric is a\ncomprehensive art. But Gorgias offers a crucial qualification that\nturns out to contribute to his downfall: rhetoric should not be used\nagainst any and everybody, any more than skill in boxing should be.\nAlthough the rhetorician teaches others to use the skill justly, it is\nalways possible for the student to misuse it. This is followed by\nanother damaging admission: the rhetorician knows what justice,\ninjustice, and other moral qualities are, and teaches them to the\nstudent if the student is ignorant of them (460a). It would follow\nthat, in Socrates’ language, the true rhetorician is a philosopher;\nand in fact that is a position Socrates takes in the\nPhaedrus. But Gorgias is not a philosopher and does not in\nfact know—cannot give an account of—the moral qualities in\nquestion. So his art is all about appearing, in the eyes of the\nignorant, to know about these topics, and then persuading them as is\nexpedient (cf. 459d-e). But this is not something Gorgias wishes to\nadmit; indeed, he allows himself to agree that since the rhetorician\nknows what justice is, he must be a just man and therefore acts justly\n(460b-c). He is caught in a contradiction: he claimed that a student\nwho had acquired the art of rhetoric could use it unjustly, but now\nclaims that the rhetorician could not commit injustice. \nAll this is just too much for Gorgias’ student Polus, whose angry\nintervention marks the second and much more bitter stage of the\ndialogue (461b3). A new point emerges that is consistent with the\nclaim that rhetoricians do not know or convey knowledge, viz. that it\nis not an art or craft (techne) but a mere knack\n(empeiria, or experience). Socrates adds that its object is\nto produce gratification. To develop the point, Socrates produces a\nstriking schema distinguishing between care of the body and care of\nthe soul. Medicine and gymnastics truly care for the body, cookery and\ncosmetics pretend to but do not. Politics is the art that cares for\nthe soul; justice and legislation are its branches, and the imitations\nof each are rhetoric and sophistry. As medicine stands to cookery, so\njustice to rhetoric; as gymnastics to cosmetics, so legislation to\nsophistry. The true forms of caring are arts (technai) aiming\nat the good; the false, knacks aiming at pleasure (464b-465d). Let us\nnote that sophistry and rhetoric are very closely allied here;\nSocrates notes that they are distinct but closely related and\ntherefore often confused by people (465c). What exactly their\ndistinction consists in is not clear, either in Plato’s discussions of\nthe matter, or historically. Socrates’s polemic here is intended to\napply to them both, as both are (alleged) to amount to a knack for\npersuasion of the ignorant by the ignorant with a view to producing\npleasure in the audience and the pleasures of power for the\nspeaker. \nSocrates’ ensuing argument with Polus is complicated and long. The nub\nof the matter concerns the relation between power and justice. For\nPolus, the person who has power and wields it successfully is happy.\nFor Socrates, a person is happy only if he or she is (morally) good,\nand an unjust or evil person is wretched—all the more so,\nindeed, if they escape punishment for their misdeeds. Polus finds this\nposition “absurd” (473a1), and challenges Socrates to take\na poll of all present to confirm the point. In sum: Plato’s suggestion\nis that rhetoric and sophistry are tied to substantive theses about\nthe irrelevance of moral truth to the happy life; about the\nconventionality or relativity of morals; and about the irrelevance of\nthe sort of inquiry into the truth of the matter (as distinguished\nfrom opinions or the results of polls) upon which Socrates keeps\ninsisting. Socrates argues for some of his most famous theses along\nthe way, such as the view that “the one who does what’s unjust\nis always more miserable than the one who suffers it, and the one who\navoids paying what’s due always more miserable than the one who does\npay it” (479e4–6). And if these hold, what use is there in\nrhetoric? For someone who wishes to avoid doing himself and others\nharm, Socrates concludes, rhetoric is altogether useless. Tied into\nlogical knots, Polus succumbs. \nAll this is just too much for yet another interlocutor in the\ndialogue, Callicles. The rhetoric of the Gorgias reaches its\nmost bitter stage. Callicles presents himself as a no-holds-barred,\nbare-knuckled, clear-headed advocate of Realpolitik, as we\nwould now call it. Telling it like it is, he draws a famous\ndistinction between nature and convention, and advances a thesis\nfamiliar to readers of Republic books I and II: “But I\nbelieve that nature itself reveals that it’s a just thing for the\nbetter man and the more capable man to have a greater share than the\nworse man and the less capable man. Nature shows that this is so in\nmany places; both among the other animals and in whole cities and\nraces of men, it shows that this is what justice has been decided to\nbe: that the superior rule the inferior and have a greater share than\nthey” (483c8–d6). This is the “law of nature”\n(483e3; perhaps the first occurrence in Western philosophy of this\nfamous phrase). Conventional talk of justice, fairness, not taking\nmore than is your share, not pursuing your individual best\ninterest—these are simply ways by which the weak seek to enslave\nthe strong. The art of rhetoric is all about empowering those who are\nstrong by nature to master the weak by nature. \nCallicles’ famous diatribe includes an indictment of philosophy as a\nchildish occupation that, if pursued past youth, interferes with the\nmanly pursuit of power, fosters contemptible ignorance of how the real\npolitical world works, and renders its possessor effeminate and\ndefenseless. His example is none other than Socrates; philosophy will\n(he says prophetically) render Socrates helpless should he be\nindicted. Helplessness in the face of the stupidity of the hoi\npolloi is disgraceful and pathetic (486a-c). By contrast, what\nwould it mean to have power? Callicles is quite explicit: power is the\nability to fulfill whatever desire you have. Power is freedom, freedom\nis license (492a-c). The capacity to do what one wants is fulfillment\nin the sense of the realization of pleasure. Rhetoric is a means to\nthat end. \nThe quarrel between rhetoric and philosophy, thus understood,\nultimately addresses a range of fundamental issues.\n“Rhetoric” is taken here to constitute an entire world\nview. Its quarrel with philosophy is comprehensive, and bears on the\nnature of nature; the existence of objective moral norms; the\nconnection (if any) between happiness and virtue; the nature and\nlimits of reason; the value of reason (understood as the rational\npursuit of objective purpose) in a human life; the nature of the soul\nor self; and the question as to whether there is a difference between\ntrue and false pleasure, i.e., whether pleasure is the good. It is\nstriking that while Socrates wants to contrast\n“rhetorical” speech-making with his own approach of\nphilosophical dialogue, in practice the differences blur. Socrates too\nstarts to speak at length, sounds rhetorical at times, and ends the\ndiscussion with a myth. Callicles advances a substantive position\n(grounded in a version of the distinction between nature and\nconvention) and defends it. These transgressions of rhetorical genres\nto one side, from Socrates’ standpoint the ultimate philosophical\nquestion at stake concerns how one should live one’s life (500c). Is\nthe life of “politics,” understood as the pursuit of power\nand glory, superior to the life of philosophy? \nReaders of the dialogue will differ as to whether or not the arguments\nthere offered decide the matter. The nub of the debate is as current\ntoday, both in academic and non-academic contexts, as it was in\nPlato’s\n day.[26]\n Even though poetry is here cast as a species of rhetoric, a good deal\nof work would have to be done to show that the substantive theses to\nwhich poetry is committed, according to the Republic, are the\nsame as the substantive theses to which rhetoric is committed,\naccording to the Gorgias. \nIs all of rhetoric bad? Are we to avoid—indeed, can we\navoid—rhetoric altogether? Even in the Gorgias, as we\nhave seen, there is a distinction between rhetoric that instills\nbelief, and rhetoric that instills knowledge, and later in the\ndialogue a form of noble rhetoric is mentioned, though no examples of\nits practitioners can be found (503a-b). The Phaedrus offers\na more detailed explanation of this distinction. \nReaders of the Phaedrus have often wondered how the dialogue\nhangs together. The first “half” seems to be about love,\nand the second about rhetoric. A slightly closer look reveals that any\nsuch simple characterization is misleading, because the first half is\nalso about rhetoric, in several different ways. To begin with, the\nfirst half of the dialogue contains explicit reflections on rhetoric;\nfor example, Socrates draws the distinction between what we would call\nthe “form” and the “content” of a discourse\n(235a). Still further, it consists in part in three speeches, at least\nthe first of which (“Lysias’ speech”) is a rhetorical\nset-piece. The other two are rhetorical as well, and presented as\nefforts to persuade a young beloved. All three are justly viewed as\nrhetorical masterstrokes by Plato, but for different reasons. The\nfirst is a brilliantly executed parody of the style of Lysias (an\norator and speech writer of significant repute). The second speech\nsimultaneously preserves aspects of its fictional frame (the first was\na paradoxical sounding address by a “non-lover” to a\n“beloved”), develops that frame (the non-lover is\ntransformed into a concealed lover), and deepens the themes in an\nimpressive and philosophically enlightening way. The third (referred\nto as the “palinode” or recantation speech) contains some\nof the most beautiful and powerful images in all of Greek literature.\nIt is mostly an allegory cast in the form of a myth, and tells the\nstory of true love and of the soul’s journeys in the cosmos human and\ndivine. That is, the rhetoric of the great palinode is markedly\n“poetic.” Especially noteworthy for present purposes is\nthe fact that the theme of inspiration is repeatedly invoked in the\nfirst half of the dialogue; poetic inspiration is explicitly\n discussed.[27] \nThe themes of poetry and rhetoric, then, are intertwined in the\nPhaedrus. It looks initially as though both rhetoric and\npoetry have gained significant stature, at least relative to their\nstatus in the Ion, Republic, and Gorgias. I\nwill begin by focusing primarily on rhetoric, and then turn to the\nquestion of poetry, even though the two themes are closely connected\nin this dialogue. \nThe second “half” of the dialogue does not discuss the\nnature of love thematically, at any length, but it does in effect\npropose that discourse prompted by the love of\nwisdom—philosophy—is true rhetoric. As the conversation\nbetween one “lover of speeches” (228c1–2) and\nanother evolves, the three rhetorical speeches of the first part of\nthe dialogue are examined from the perspective of their rhetorical\nartlessness or artfulness. Poetry is once again cast as a kind of\nspeech making (258b3) and, very importantly, Socrates declares that\n“It’s not speaking or writing well that’s shameful; what’s\nreally shameful is to engage in either of them shamefully or\nbadly”\n (258d4–5).[28]\n The proffering of discourses is not in and of itself shameful; what\nthen constitutes honorable speech making? \nThe answer to this crucial question constitutes one of the most famous\ncontributions to the topic. In essence, Socrates argues that someone\nwho is going to speak well and nobly must know the truth about the\nsubject he is going to discuss. The sort of theory Polus and Callicles\nmaintained in the Gorgias is false (see Phaedrus\n259e4–260a4). In order to make good on this sweeping claim,\nSocrates argues that rhetoric is an “art” (techne), and\nnot just artless practice (the equivalent of the\n“empeiria” for which rhetoric was condemned in the\nGorgias). How to show that it is an art after all? Quite a\nnumber of claimants to rhetoric are named and reviewed, and readers\nwho have an interest in the history of Greek rhetoric rightly find\nthese passages invaluable. We are told here that the extant manuals of\nrhetoric offer the “preliminaries” to the true art of\nrhetoric, not the thing itself (269b7–8). \nMany rhetoricians have artfully and effectively misled their\naudiences, and Socrates argues—somewhat implausibly\nperhaps—that in order to mislead one cannot oneself be\n misled.[29]\n An artful speech exhibits its artfulness in its structure, one\nthat—since in the best case it embodies the truth—retraces\nor mirrors the natural divisions of the subject matter itself. It will\nnot only be coherent, but structured in a way that mirrors the way the\nsubject itself is naturally organized. In one of Socrates’ most famous\nimages, a good composition should exhibit the organic unity of a\nliving creature, “with a body of its own; it must be neither\nwithout head nor without legs; and it must have a middle and\nextremities that are fitting both to one another and to the whole\nwork” (264c1–5). This will not be truly accomplished if it\nonly looks that way; to be that way, a discourse’s\nunity should reflect the unity of its subject. \nAt this point we might want to ask about the audience; after\nall, the rhetorician is trying to persuade someone of something. Might\nnot the speaker know the truth of the matter, and know how to embody\nit artfully in a composition, but fail to persuade anyone of it? Would\nnot a failure to persuade indicate that the speaker lacks the complete\nart of rhetoric? Socrates in effect responds to this question by\npostulating that the successful speaker must also know the nature of\nthe human soul, else his skill is just “empeiria” (the\nterm from the Gorgias again) rather than “techne”\n(270b6). Just as an expert physician must understand both the human\nbody and the body of medical knowledge—these being\ninseparable—so too the expert speaker must understand both the\nhuman soul and what is known about the soul. The reader will\nimmediately recall that the great speech (the palinode) in the first\nhalf of the Phaedrus was about the soul in its cosmic\ncontext—the soul’s nature, its journeys divine and human, its\nlongings, the objects of its longings, its failures and their\nconsequences, were all part of the same story. Thus it is not\nsurprising that when defining the art of rhetoric Socrates suggests\nthat we cannot “reach a serious understanding of the nature of\nthe soul without understanding the nature of the world as a\nwhole” (270c1–2). The consequence of this approach to\nrhetoric has now become clear: to possess that art, one must be a\nphilosopher. True rhetoric is philosophical discourse. \nBut what happened to the question about the audience? “The\nsoul” is not the addressee of a rhetorical discourse. Socrates\nresponds that the artful rhetorician must also know what the types of\nsoul are, what sorts of speeches “work” on each type, and\nbe able to identify which type is being addressed on the given\noccasion. This last demand is a matter of practice and of the ability\nto size up the audience on the spot, as it were. The requirements of\nthe true art of rhetoric, which Socrates also calls the “art of\ndialectic” (276e5–6), are very high indeed. (The reader\nwill find them summarized at 277b5–c6). \nIf the audience is philosophical, or includes philosophers, how would\nthe true, artful, philosophical dialectician address it? This question\nis not faced head-on in the Phaedrus, but we are given a\nnumber of clues. They are introduced by means of a myth—by a\nkind of “poetry,” if you will—and they help us\nunderstand the sort of discourse a philosopher will on the whole wish\nto avoid, namely that which is written. According to\nreflections inaugurated by the Theuth and Thamus myth, the written\nword is not the most suitable vehicle for communicating truth, because\nit cannot answer questions put to it; it simply repeats itself when\nqueried; it tends to substitute the authority of the author for the\nreader’s open minded inquiry into the truth; and it circulates\neverywhere indiscriminately, falling into the hands of people who\ncannot understand it. Very importantly, it interferes with true\n“recollection” (anamnesis, 249c2), that process\ndescribed at length and (for the most part) poetically in the\ndialogue’s “palinode,” by which the knowledge latent in\nthe soul is brought out through question and answer (274d-275b).\nWriting is a clumsy medium, and thus would not match the potential\neffectiveness of philosophical give and take, the “Socratic\ndialogue” which best leads the philosophical mind to truth. This\ndesirable rhetoric is “a discourse that is written down, with\nknowledge, in the soul of the listener; it can defend itself, and it\nknows for whom it should speak and for whom it should remain\nsilent” (276a5–7). Dialectical speech is accompanied by\nknowledge, can defend itself when questioned, and is productive of\nknowledge in its audience (276e4–277a4). Of course, all this\nraises the question as to the status of Plato’s dialogues, since they\nare themselves writings; we will return to it briefly below. \nRhetoric is the art of “directing the soul by means of\nspeech” (261a8). Popular rhetoric is not an art, but a knack for\npersuasion. Artful rhetoric requires philosophy; but does philosophy\nrequire rhetoric? Why must philosophical discourse—say, as\nexemplified in “Socratic dialogue”—have anything to\ndo with rhetoric? The Phaedrus points to the interesting\nthought that all discourse is rhetorical, even when the\nspeaker is simply trying to communicate the truth—indeed, true\nrhetoric is the art of communicating the truth (notice the broad sweep\nof the discussion of discourse at 277e5–278b4). Rhetoric is\npresent wherever and whenever people speak (261d10–e4 and context).\nEven when one is not sure what the truth is, and even when one is\nthinking through something by oneself—carrying on an inner\ndialogue, as it were—discourse and persuasion are\n present.[30]\n Of course, a philosopher will question assertions that he or she\nought to persuaded of X; but that questioning too, the\nPhaedrus suggests, is part of a process aimed at warranted\npersuasion, and inevitably involves a mix of the\n“persuadability” of the philosopher on the one hand, and\nthe truth (or falsity) of the claims on the other. The bottom line is\nthat there is no escaping from persuasion, and so none from\nrhetoric—including of course from the very problem of\ndistinguishing between warranted and unwarranted persuasion.\nSelf-deception is an ever-present possibility (as Socrates implies\nhere, and notes at Cratylus 428d). That is a problem about\nwhich the philosopher above all worries about. It is always a question\nof “directing the soul by means of speech,” even where\nit’s a matter of the soul directing or leading itself (or to use a\nphrase from earlier in the dialogue, moving itself\n (245e)).[31] \nThe Gorgias’ notion that the struggle between (popular)\nrhetoric and philosophy—or as we might say, unphilosophical and\nphilosophical rhetoric—is one between comprehensive outlooks is\nclear from the Phaedrus as well. The “great\nspeech” or palinode of the dialogue illustrates the character\nand range of views upon which the project of philosophical rhetoric\n(of philosophy, in short) is built. The speech is quite explicitly a\nretraction of an outlook that does not espouse these views; ordinary\nrhetoric moves in a very different moral, metaphysical, psychological,\nand epistemic world. It is an interesting fact that Plato deploys\ncertain elements of poetry (such as myth, allegory, simile, image) in\ndrawing the contrast between these outlooks. \nThat poetry is itself a kind of persuasive discourse or rhetoric has\nalready been mentioned. It comes as no surprise to read that Socrates\nindicts rhapsodes on the grounds that their speeches proceed\n“without questioning and explanation” and “are given\nonly in order to produce conviction” (277e8–9). This\nechoes the Ion’s charge that the rhapsodes do not know what\nthey are talking about. But what about the rationale that the poets\nand rhapsodes are inspired? \nInspiration comes up numerous times in the Phaedrus. It and\nthe related notions of Bacchic frenzy, madness, and possession are\ninvoked repeatedly almost from the start of the dialogue (228b), in\nconnection with Phaedrus’ allegedly inspiring recitation of Lysias’\ntext (234d1–6), and as inspiring Socrates’s two speeches\n(237a7–b1, 262d2–6, 263d1–3). These references are\nuniformly playful, even at times joking. More serious is the\ndistinction between ordinary madness and divine madness, and the\ndefense of the superiority of divine madness, which Socrates’ second\nspeech sets out to defend. In particular, he sets out to show that the\nmadness of love or eros “is given us by the gods to ensure our\ngreatest good fortune” (245b7–c1). The case is first made by\nnoting that three species of madness are already accepted: that of the\nprophets, that of certain purifying or cathartic religious rites, and\nthe third that inspiration granted by the Muses that moves its\npossessor to poetry (244b-245a). As noted, it begins to look as though\na certain kind of poetry (the inspired) is being rehabilitated. \nAnd yet when Socrates comes to classify kinds of lives a bit further\non, the poets (along with those who have anything to do with\nmimesis) rank a low sixth out of nine, after the likes of\nhousehold managers, financiers, doctors, and prophets (248e1–2)!\nThe poet is just ahead of the manual laborer, sophist, and tyrant. The\nphilosopher comes in first, as the criterion for the ranking concerns\nthe level of knowledge of truth about the Ideas or Forms of which the\nsoul in question is capable. This hierarchy of lives could scarcely be\nsaid to rehabilitate the poet. The Phaedrus quietly sustains\nthe critique of poetry, as well as (much less quietly) of\nrhetoric. \nPlato’s critique of writing on the grounds that it is a poor form of\nrhetoric is itself written. Of course, his Socrates does not know that\nhe is “speaking” in the context of a written dialogue; but\nthe reader immediately discerns the puzzle. Does the critique apply to\nthe dialogues themselves? If not, do the dialogues escape the critique\naltogether, or meet it in part (being inferior to “live”\ndialogue, but not liable to the full force of Socrates’ criticisms)?\nScholars dispute the answers to these well-known\n questions.[32] \nThere is general agreement that Plato perfected—perhaps even\ninvented—a new form of discourse. The Platonic dialogue is a\ninnovative type of rhetoric, and it is hard to believe that it does\nnot at all reflect—whether successfully or not is another\nmatter—Plato’s response to the criticisms of writing which he\nputs into the mouth of his Socrates. \nPlato’s remarkable philosophical rhetoric incorporates elements of\npoetry. Most obviously, his dialogues are dramas with several formal\nfeatures in common with much tragedy and comedy (for example, the use\nof authorial irony, the importance of plot, setting, the role of\nindividual character and the interplay between dramatis\npersonae). No character called “Plato” ever says a\nword in his texts. His works also narrate a number of myths, and\nsparkle with imagery, simile, allegory, and snatches of meter and\nrhyme. Indeed, as he sets out the city in speech in the\nRepublic, Socrates calls himself a myth teller\n(376d9–10, 501e4–5). In a number of ways, the dialogues\nmay be said to be works of fiction; none of them took place exactly as\npresented by Plato, several could not have taken place, some contain\ncharacters who never existed. These are imaginary conversations,\nimitations of certain kinds of philosophical conversations. As reader, one\nis undoubtedly invited to see oneself reflected in various\ncharacters, and to that extent identify with them, even while also\nfocusing on the arguments, exchanges, and speeches. Readers of Plato\noften refer to the “literary” dimension of his writings,\nor simply refer to them as a species of philosophical literature.\nExactly what to make of his appropriation of elements of poetry is\nonce again a matter of long discussion and\n controversy.[33] \nSuffice it to say that Plato’s last word on the critique of poetry and\nrhetoric is not spoken in his dialogues, but is embodied in the\ndialogue form of writing he brought to perfection.","contact.mail":"griswold@bu.edu","contact.domain":"bu.edu"}]
