Edwards","entry":"origen","body.text":"\n\n\n\nOrigen (c. 185–c. 253) was a Christian exegete and theologian,\nwho made copious use of the allegorical method in his commentaries,\nand (though later considered a heretic) laid the foundations of\nphilosophical theology for the church. He was taught by a certain\nAmmonius, whom the majority of scholars identify as Ammonius Saccas,\nthe teacher of Plotinus; many believe, however, that the external\nevidence will not allow us to identify him with the Origen whom\nPlotinus knew as a colleague. He was certainly well-instructed in\nphilosophy and made use of it as an ancillary to the exposition and\nharmonization of scripture. This was the task that he undertook in\nmost of his extant writings, and the more systematic theology is\nfounded on the ecclesiastical doctrines of the Trinity, the\nincarnation, salvation after death and the inerrancy of scripture.\n\n\n\nOrigen was the first Christian to speak of three\n“hypostases” in the Trinity and to use the term\nhomoousios (though only by analogy) of the relation between\nthe second of these hypostases and the first. The Father, or first\nperson, is nevertheless the only one who is autotheos, God in\nthe fullest sense, whereas the Son is his dunamis or power\nand the Spirit a dependent being, operative only in the elect. All\nthree are eternal and incorporeal, the Son being known as Wisdom in\nrelation to the Father and Logos (reason, word) in relation to the\nworld. In this capacity he is the shepherd of rational beings the\nlogikoi, who, according to his later critics, were said in\nhis lost writings to have been in origin incorporeal beings coeval\nwith the world if not eternal, and currently imprisoned in material\nbodies only because of a cooling in their love. It is not so easy to\ndemonstrate from his extant works that he held the material world in\nsuch contempt, though he certainly holds it to be created out of\nnothing and suspects that the concept of matter is philosophically\nredundant.  Souls, in his view, are sent down into bodies (perhaps\nnever more than once, though again some critics impute to him a\ndoctrine of transmigration or chronic falling away from bliss). The\nsoul remains indefeasibly free in its choices, and the misuse of this\nfreedom is the cause of its captivity to the devil.\n\n\n\nThe deliverance of the soul is effected by the incarnation of the\nLogos, or second person of the Trinity, who assumes real body but\nremains fully God. His death on the Cross is a ransom to the devil,\nand his resurrection prefigures that of the saints, though he seems to\nimagine the body after death, in Platonic terms, as a tenuous vehicle\nof the soul. Scholars differ as to whether he envisages a final\nabsorption of the body into incorporeal spirit. It is clear that he\nexpects the vast majority of souls to endure a fiery purification\nafter death, and that no soul will be excluded by God’s will from this\npurgatory. While he thinks it possible that some may be too debauched\nby their sins to repent, he also opines that the devil himself will at\nlast make peace with God, though he cannot attain beatitude. In the\npresent life, an anticipation of bliss in the presence of Christ can\nbe enjoyed by the exegete who has fully mastered the spiritual meaning\nof the scriptures. These are the word of God to us because Christ the\nword is ubiquitously present in them, investing them with a threefold\nsense as he himself assumed body, soul and spirit for our sake in his\nsojourn on earth.\n\n\n\nThe Greek name Origenes signifies “born of Horus,” an\nEgyptian falcon-headed deity. The Christian scholar of this name was a\nnative of Alexandria (Eusebius, Church History 6.1), though\nit is only his detractor Epiphanius who says that he was also by race\na Copt (Panarion 1.1). Eusebius records the jibe of the\nNeoplatonist Porphyry that Origen, though a Greek by education, became\na Christian, whereas his philosophy teacher Ammonius, having once been\na Christian, converted to a more lawful way of life (Church\nHistory 6.19.7). Although most scholars assume that this is\nAmmonius Saccas, the teacher of Plotinus, there was another\nphilosopher of the same name, who is credited with “unequalled\npolymathy” by the philosopher Longinus at Porphyry, Life of\nPlotinus 20.49–50. (For further information see Edwards\n1993: 179.) Eusebius, moreover, asserts that that both Origen and his\nteacher were Christians throughout their lives (6.19.10); as evidence\nof the latter’s Christianity in his youth, he records that his father\nLeontius died as a martyr in 202, and that Origen himself, then 17,\nnot only exhorted Leontius to persevere but thirsted for the same\ndeath (6.2.7). His mother could curb his enthusiasm only by hiding his\nclothes so that he was ashamed to leave the house (6.2.6). Eusebius\nalso tells us that his sexual diffidence or his ascetic temper induced\nOrigen to make himself literally a eunuch for the kingdom of heaven\n(6.8.2); the act is not unparalleled (Markschies 2007: 15–34),\nbut Epiphanius was unable to verify the story (Panarion\n64.2). \n\nAfter his father’s death, Origen devoted himself to scholarship and\nbecame a notable teacher, perhaps succeeding Clement as head of the\ncatechetical school in Alexandria (Eusebius, Church History\n6.3.1 and 6.7–8.1; but cf. Osborn 2008: 19–21). He appears\nto have studied Hebrew with a converted Jew (First Principles\n1.3.4 etc.), and one of his letters alludes to his studies in\nphilosophy with an unnamed teacher (Eusebius, Church History\n6.19.13). Among the works Eusebius says that he composed at this time,\ndictating to “more than seven stenographers” (6.23.2),\nwere the first five books of his Commentary on John, eight\nbooks of a Commentary on Genesis, two books On the\nResurrection and his major surviving work, a synthesis of\nscriptural teaching under the name First Principles\n(6.24). Of these the last survives entire, but only in the Latin of\nRufinus. A few books of the Commentary on John survive in\nGreek, while portions of the work on the resurrection were preserved\nin a rejoinder by Methodius of Olympia, which itself survives only in\nthe excerpts and epitomes of later authors (see Dechow 1977). It was\nalso in Alexandria, in imitation of the Homeric scholars of the\nHellenistic era, that Origen addressed himself to the preparation of\nhis great Hexapla, in which a corrected edition of the Septuagint, the\noriginal, allegedly inspired translation of the Hebrew scriptures\n(3rd c. BC?), stood in parallel to the Hebrew and the\nrenderings of other Greek translators (Eusebius, Church\nHistory 6.16. See further Neuschäfer 1987; Dorival 2013). \n\nAccording to Eusebius, his talents excited the jealousy of Demetrius,\nthe Bishop of Alexandria, who cited his self-castration as a reason\nfor refusing to ordain him as a presbyter (Eusebius, Church\nHistory 6.8.4–5). Nevertheless, when Origen left Alexandria\nin 216 to escape the ferocity of the Emperor Caracalla, Demetrius\nrecalled him from Caesarea, where he had already begun to increase his\nreputation (6.19.16–19). On a subsequent visit to Caesarea he\nwas ordained a presbyter, and took up residence in the city (6.8.5;\n6.23.4). Having commenced a commentary on the Song of Songs in the\ncourse of a sojourn in Athens (6.32.2), he completed this in Caesarea,\ntogether with his Commentary on Matthew and his refutation of\nthe True Logos, a pagan satire on Christianity written around\n170 by an otherwise unknown Celsus (6.36.2). Never rising above the\nrank of presbyter, he was often employed, according to the custom of\nthe times, as a mouthpiece of orthodoxy in trials of heretics before\nan episcopal synod. Eusebius commends his refutation of Beryllus of\nBostra (6.33), adding that he was summoned to play a similar role in\nArabia (6.37), and that in his books he tore the mask from heresies\nold and new. To this period of his life we should also date\nthe Dialogue with Heraclides, discovered at Tura in 1951\n(Chadwick 1959). Yet even at the height of his career, his orthodoxy\nwas impugned. Jerome knows of a letter in which he rebuts the\naccusation that he had prophesied the salvation of the devil (Crouzel\n1973); the same letter indicates, according to Jerome, that his\nteachings had given offence to Heraclas, his former student who had\nnow succeeded Demetrius as bishop of Alexandria. It is clear at least\nthat no censure was extended to Dionysius, the successor of Heraclas\nand another of Origen’s pupils. In Caesarea the ageing theologian\nsuffered tortures under Decius in 251 (Eusebius, Church\nHistory 6.39.5) and, according to Eusebius, died as Gallus came\nto the throne in 253 (7.1.1).  His assertion that Origen was then in\nhis seventieth year is inconsistent with the date implied for his\nbirth (185). Most scholars have elected to postpone the death of\nOrigen to 254 or 255, without explaining why they think the biographer\nmore likely to have erred with regard to the year of his subject’s\nbirth than that of his death.  \n\nHis library in Caesarea was inherited by his admirer Pamphilus, then\nby Eusebius as a disciple of Pamphilus and bishop of that city. It\nalso fell to Eusebius to finish the Apology which Pamphilus\nhad begun to write against Origen’s first detractors. From this work\nand the philippics of such enemies of Origen as Jerome, Theophilus of\nAlexandria, Epiphanius of Salamis, and the Emperor Justinian, we can\ncull fragments of writings that have otherwise perished (see further\nClark 1992). We also possess an anthology of choice excerpts from his\nwritings the Philokalia (McLynn 2004), and two short\ntexts On Prayer and To the Martyrs. Much had already\nbeen lost by attrition in the time of Eusebius (died c.339); more may\nhave perished after Origen was anathematized in or around the year\n553. Many of Origen’s Commentaries and Homilies, like the First\nPrinciples, survive only in the Latin of Rufinus, who translated\nhim in the fourth century with reverence but not always with fidelity\n(see further Pace 1990). The following synopsis of Origen’s thought is\nbased primarily on the extant corpus in Greek and Latin, making use of\npolemical matter only with the caution that is now enjoined by the\nmost learned scholars. \n\nScholars are apt to speak casually of Origen’s Platonism, more\ntechnically of his “middle” Platonism, most commonly, and\nnot often with conscious paradox, of his Christian Platonism. The\nLutheran theologian Anders Nygren (1953), who protested that a\nChristian Platonist is not a Christian, differed only in his judgment\nof the facts, not in his reading of them, from his critics J.M. Rist\n(1964) and Catherine Osborne (1994), who maintained that Platonism in\nOrigen’s hands was not so much an adulteration as a salutary\nrefinement of the gospel.  Nevertheless, whatever the merits of\nNygren’s theology, Origen would have agreed with him in the matter of\nnomenclature. The majority of his explicit references to Plato are to\nbe found in the work Against Celsus, a reply to a dead\npolemicist who is nowadays characterized as a middle Platonist, though\nOrigen hints that he may have been an Epicurean (Against\nCelsus] 1.8; see further Bergjan 2001). Origen undertakes to show\nthat the simplest disciple of God’s word knows him better than the\nphilosophers who seek him by their own methods (Against\nCelsus 7.42), that Plato misrepresents the fall and diminishes\nthe Creator, that if his myths are deep, the biblical allegories are\ndeeper and less perverse, and that Numenius, the foremost Platonist of\nrecent times, has spoken of both Moses and Jesus with esteem\n(Against Celsus 4.51 etc.). \n\nThe Bible (consisting for Origen only of the New Testament and the\nSeptuagint) is the matrix of every argument in this as in all his\nwritings; while it would be naive, and a contradiction of his own\npractice, to deny that that his exegesis was conditioned by\nphilosophical assumptions; the propaedeutic to biblical study in his\nschool at Caesarea was not Platonism but a professedly unprejudiced\nsurvey of all the Greek schools. We learn this from his pupil Gregory\nThaumaturgus (Panegyric 13.151–152), to whom he also\nwrote a letter assigning to Greek thought an ancillary role in the\nelucidation of the scriptures; while he was less inclined than his\npredecessors to accuse the Greeks of plagiarizing their philosophical\nviews from the books of Moses, he held that, since every exercise of\nreason is inspired by Christ the Logos, a Christian has as much right\nto the tools of pagan philosophy as the Israelites had to reimburse\ntheir labour from the “spoils of the Egyptians”\n(Philokalia 13; see further Martens 2012:\n29–33). Theologians have at last begun to take Origen\nat his word as an interpreter of the scriptures; this is not to say\nthat all other influences are ignored, but that he is thought to\ndeserve the same courtesy that Classicists show to Plotinus when they\nacknowledge that even doctrines which he consciously shares with the\nStoics or Aristotle can be derived without subterfuge from the text of\nPlato. \n\nThe epithet “Platonist” will of course be warranted if\nOrigen the Christian is identified with the Origen whom Porphyry\nrepresents as one of the privileged disciples of Ammonius Saccas, the\nAlexandrian teacher of Plotinus. According to Porphyry (Life of\nPlotinus, 3.20–38) this Origen swore an oath with Plotinus\nand a third disciple, Herennius, not to reveal the esoteric doctrines\nof Ammonius after the latter’s death in 243 A.D. This story implies\nboth personal intimacy and geographical proximity, yet Origen the\nChristian was at this time almost sixty (twenty years senior to\nPlotinus), had left Alexandria for Caesarea some years before, and\nalready had a multitude of books to his name as a Christian teacher.\nPorphyry does not allude to these lucubrations in his Life of\nPlotinus, but says that the Origen he refers to breached the pact\nby issuing first a treatise On Daemons, then another, with\nthe title That the King is the Only Maker, in the reign of\nGallienus (253–268). He includes in the Life a letter,\nwritten in 262 or 263 by his former tutor Longinus, which ascribes to\nOrigen only the work On Daemons (Porphyry, Life of\nPlotinus, 20.36–45). All scholars agree that Origen the\nChristian could not have written anything in the last years of\nGallienus; if we can trust Eusebius, he did not live to see this reign\nat all, but died in that of Gallienus’ predecessor Gallus\n(251–253).  So, if this Origen is our author, Porphyry must at\nleast have misstated the period at which he violated the\nagreement. Those who contend that there was only one Origen reply that\nit is the chronology of Eusebius that must be flawed because, although\nhis account of Origen’s youth implies that he was born in 185, he\nasserts that his death occurred in his seventieth year, and hence not\nearlier than 254, the first year of Gallienus. The same apologists\nargue that Porphyry fails to mention his Christian writings either\nbecause he despised them or (more cogently) because the publication of\nthem did not violate the oath (cf. Ramelli 2009). If this argument is\nto prevail, a reason must also be furnished for the silence of\nLonginus on this part of Origen’s work, the Christian works of Origen\nmust be regarded as aids (in some degree) to the reconstruction of the\nteaching of Ammonius, and something must be said to explain the\nfailure of Origen’s Christian detractors in late antiquity to cite the\ntwo works—still extant, according to Proclus—which he\nadded to the Neoplatonic canon. For these reasons, while theologians\nhave often maintained, or simply assumed, the identity of the two\nOrigens, the author of the article on Origen in the Oxford\nClassical Dictionary asserts that the contrary position is\nnowadays the more widely held (Smith 2012; see further Edwards 1993).\n \n\nThe opening chapter of Origen’s First Principles is a\nparadigmatic instance of his application of philosophic reasoning to\nbiblical exegesis. He assumes here what he asserts elsewhere, that the\nnature of God is known to us only by his own revelation in the sacred\ntext. The scriptures tell us both that God is fire and that God is\nspirit, but Origen warns us not to deduce, from a literal construction\nof these terms, that he is a body (Princ. 1.1.1). It is\npossible but not certain, that he has in mind the Stoicizing theology\nof Tertullian: the Bible speaks more plainly on this matter than any\nStoic, and few of Origen’s contemporaries would have doubted the\ncorporeality of fire or spirit. In urging the contrary position, that\nGod is incorporeal. Origen speaks not only for the Platonists but for\nall the Greek apologists of the church: the prevalent thought of his\ntime (and perhaps of ours) required that if God is to be invisible,\nimmutable, eternal, omnipresent, and irresistible in power he must not\nbe confined to one place or composed of labile matter. The\nphilosophical sympathies of Origen become evident when he goes on to\nequate this bodiless god with nous or intellect. In\nPlato, nous had been an occasional synonym for the Demiurge,\nwhile Numenius of Apamea, half a century before Origen, had\nsubordinated the Demiurge, as a second nous, to the\n“first nous”, which is Plato’s form of the\nGood. Although the Good in Plato is superior to ousia or\nbeing, Numenius like the majority of Platonists before Origen, appears\nto have posited nothing higher than intellect; Origen too—in\nthis respect a good Platonist—is less inclined to apophatic\ntheology than Philo the Alexandrian Jew or his Christian predecessors\nin Egypt, Clement and Basilides. To explain the selective use of the\ndefinite article in John 1.1, he characterizes the Father (ho\ntheos) as autotheos, very God, in contrast to the Son who\nis merely theos (CommJohn 2.7.16–18); when he\nsuggests, however, that the Father is higher than nous\n(Against Celsus 7.45), he does not develop a metaphysical\ntheory, any more than he develops his hint in the same work that God\nmay be the Aristotelian “thought of thoughts” (see further\nWhittaker 1969). Tobias Böhm’s ingenious suggestion (2002) that for\nOrigen the being of God is his nous, and his unity that which\nis higher than nous, assumes that he was acquainted with the\nfirst and second hypotheses of the Parmenides, a dialogue of\nwhich he evinces little knowledge in his extant works.   \n\nWhether he is noetic or supranoetic, Origen’s God cannot be known to\nus in his essence, nor is it by his ousia, or essence, but by\nhis dunamis, or power, that he acts upon other beings (On\nPrayer 25.3). His dunamis, which is infinite and\nmediated by the second person of the Trinity, is the source of\nevery dunamis that is exercised by his creatures, even by\nthose who have fallen into apostasy and rebellion (CommJohn\n1.39.291). On the other hand nothing, not even the second person,\nproceeds directly from the immutable ousia of God\n(CommJohn 13.25.153 and 20.18.157: see below). Yet, while he\nasserts that God is by nature impassible—in the sense that he is\nthe agent, not the patient, in every transaction and cannot be moved\nby any external force—Origen is one of the first theologians to\nassert that he can suffer, in a sense, as God, and not only by virtue\nof the incarnation (Homilies on Ezekiel 6.1; see Osborn 1994:\n164–184). This suffering takes the form of commiseration for the\nplight of his sinful creatures, never of sorrow on his own\naccount. Compassion supposes knowledge, and Origen appears to have\nbeen untroubled by the difficulties that arise from the ascription of\ncontingent knowledge to an eternal being. That God transcends the\ntemporal order is evident from his answer to those who ask what God\nwas doing before he created the world: the question, he argues,\npresupposes a time before the beginning of the world, but reflection\nteaches us that time and the revolutions of the cosmos are coeval\n(Princ. 3.5.3). This is a Platonic doctrine, but it had now\nbecome common for Platonists to argue, in submission to Aristotle,\nthat the temporal world has neither end nor beginning and is\n“generated” only in the sense that it is a theatre of\nvicissitude, in which all that exists has come into being and will\npass away.  \n\n           \nThe agent whom we call the Second Person of the Trinity is\n“another god” at Dialogue with Heraclides 2 and a\n“second god” on two occasions in his work Against\nCelsus (5.39, 5.61). This appellation is not attested in earlier\nChristian prose, though it is anticipated in Philo and Numenius. It\ndoes not occur in works addressed by Origen to Christians of sound\nfaith, not even in those which show no fear of subordinating the Son\nto the Father—an indication perhaps that it was avoided because\nit savoured of polytheism and not because it belied the equality of\nthe divine persons (Edwards 2006). It seems that in Numenius it is the\ncontemplation of the first intellect by the second that gives rise to\nthe forms, or Platonic ideas; Origen, as a Christian, holds that the\ncontemplation is mutual, since “no-one knows the Son but the\nFather and no-one knows the Father but the Son” (Matthew 11.27).\nThus he maintains, on the one hand, that the Son, as truth (John\n14.6), knows all that is in the mind of the Father; the infamous\nproviso that the Son does not see the Father signifies only that\nwithin the Godhead vision is not mediated by our physical organs\n(Princ. 1.1.8).  On the other hand, when we read that the Son\nis the wisdom and power of the Father (1 Corinthians 1.24) and that\nthe world was created through him (Hebrews 1.2), we are to understand\nthat he is that divine helpmate who declares at Proverbs 8.22 that the\nLord created her in the beginning of his ways, and at Wisdom7.26 that\nshe is the mirror of his unspotted majesty. The verb\n“created” in this text (which Origen prefers to the alternative reading\n“possessed”) does not imply that the Son has a temporal\nbeginning, but that, having no other substrate than the Father’s will,\nhe expresses that will more perfectly than the things that are\n“made” from matter. It is inconceivable that the Father\ncould ever have lacked wisdom, and equally inconceivable to Origen\nthat this wisdom could ever have taken a different form from the one\nthat it now possesses as the second person or hypostasis of the\nTrinity (Princ. 1.2.2). He is the first theologian to state\nunequivocally that the “three hypostases” which constitute\nthe Trinity are eternal not only in nature, but in their hypostatic\ncharacter; there was never a time when wisdom was the latent thought\nof the Father and had not yet come forth as speech. \n\nThough Origen rejects it, this was in fact the prevailing thesis of\nmost Christian writing in the second century when it undertook to\nexplain the Fourth Evangelist’s assertion that the one who became\nincarnate was the Logos who had been with the Father as theos\n(god) if not ho theos (God) from the beginning (John 1.1).\nSince it was this speech or word that created the world, it was\nargued, there would have been no reason for it to exist before the\ncreation as a distinct hypostasis. If he existed at all, it was as\nthe logos endiathetos, the word within, which had not yet\nemerged from the mind as logos prophorikos, or verbal\nutterance. In this latent phase he could be identified (as Philo had\nalready argued) with the paradigm, or world of forms, which supplies\nthe Platonic demiurge with his pattern for the creation. Clement of\nAlexandria accepts this equation, albeit perhaps without denying the\nhypostatic eternity of the Logos (Edwards 2000). Origen, however,\nresists the interpretation of Logos as “speech” because\nthere are some who take this to imply that the second person is merely\na function or epiphenomenon of the first (CommJohn 1.24.151;\nOrbe 1991). Logos, in his view, is one of the numerous designations\n(epinoiai) which are conferred on the second person to define\nhis relation, not to the Father (as “Son” and\n“Wisdom” do) but to his creatures (CommJohn\n2.9.66 etc.): he is Logos as the paradigm and parent of all\nthe logikai, or rational beings, who exercise reason only by\nparticipation in him. He cannot be identified with the world of forms,\nor Platonic ideas, because to Origen these ideas are imaginary\nentities which the Greeks absurdly suppose to be independent of the\nCreator (Princ. 2.3.6). It appears then that he endorsed the\nolder and more literal reading of the Timaeus, according to\nwhich the Demiurge, the forms and matter are three autonomous\nprinciples of being. Before him Philo, Alcinous, and Clement of\nAlexandria had construed the forms as thoughts in the mind of the\nDemiurge, while Alexander of Aphrodisias held that they gave content\nto God’s eternal contemplation of himself (Armstrong 1960). Origen\nhimself opines that all genera, all species and even the archetypes of\nall particular things are eternally present in the mind of God\n(Princ. 1.4.5), but he holds this as a Christian antidote to\ndifficulties which arise from the temporality of the world. \n\nThese difficulties, as Origen perceived, had not been fully resolved\nby the argument that since the world is coeval with time we need not\nask what God was doing before he created it (see further Tzamalikos\n2006: 179–271). From Genesis 1.1 we learn that God created the\nworld in the beginning, and from John 1.1 that the Logos was with him\nin the beginning; but as we are also told that God created all things\nin wisdom, Origen takes this beginning to be not a temporal origin but\nthe eternal desideratum of existence who is also the second person of\nthe Trinity (CommJohn 1.39.289). It follows, however, that if\nthis temporal world is the only one, an infinite cause has exhausted\nitself in a finite effect. Perhaps it was in the hope of evading this\nparadox that Origen interpreted Solomon’s dictum, “there is\nnothing new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1.10) to mean that\nworlds have existed before the present one (Princ. 3.1.6).\nThis manoeuvre, however, will bring no escape unless one posits an\ninfinite succession of worlds before and after the present one, and\neven Origen’s enemies do not say that he went so far. An endless\nseries, after all, would be sempiternal rather than eternal, and the\nStoics might have replied that their belief in the perpetual\nreduplication of the same cosmos—a belief disowned by\nOrigen (Cels. 4. 68)—comes closer to matching timeless\nactivity with a timeless product. A better solution than either of\nthese, in Origen’s view, was to posit a noetic realm, created but\neternal, populated by logika, or rational entities, under the\nhegemony of the logos, and preceding ours in the ontological hierarchy\nrather than in the temporal continuum (Princ.\n2.9.4). Evidence for this conceit could be found in the creation of a\nheaven and earth at Genesis 1.1 before the creation of the visible\nfirmament (Genesis Homilies 1.5). To the modern mind this is\nforced exegesis, representing the triumph of philosophy over\nphilology; the philosophy, however, is not that of any Greek school,\nbut of a Christian who has set himself a conundrum by his fidelity to\nMoses. It is a striking observation, however we explain it, that the\nforms of particular things which coexist in the mind of Origen’s God\nwith the genera and species are not attested in any pagan Platonist\nbefore Plotinus, his younger contemporary and (as most believe) a\nfellow-pupil of Ammonius Saccas (cf. Plotinus, Enneads\n5.7). \n\nAs the absolute and transcendent dunamis of the Father\n(Cels. 1.66; CommJohn 1.18.107 etc.), the second\nperson is properly the lord of every dunamis in heaven and\nearth (Cels. 5.45). At the same time, it can be said that he\nis the food of the celestial dunameis who have remained true\nto the Creator, while Satan is the food of those who have fallen\n(On Prayer 27.12). It is the angelic dunameis who\nkeep watch over his cradle at the time of his nativity (Cels.\n1.61), and who sometimes form a retinue at the scenes where he\nperforms those works of power which we call miracles\n(CommJohn 2.4.40).  This polysemic usage of the term, which\nmirrors that of the New Testament, presents no difficulty so long as\nevery other dunamis is conceived as a lower or local\nmanifestation of the undivided power which appertains to him as\nLogos. As we have seen, this term defines his hegemonic relation to\nthe created order; Wisdom is another of his biblical appellations, yet\nthis Wisdom is the beginning in which the Logos was with God\n(CommJohn 1.39.289; see further Tzamalikos 2006:\n119–178). However one accounts for these obscurities, it seems\nunlikely that Origen could have signed the Nicene Creed of 325, in\nwhich the Son is declared to be from the ousia of the Father,\nand therefore homoousios (of one essence, substance or\nnature) with him (cf. CommJohn 20.18.157). A community of\nnature between the two is asserted, however, at CommJohn\n2.10.76); and in his Commentary on Hebrews, he deduces from\nWisdom 7.26, where Wisdom is styled an aporroia or emanation\nof the Father, that the relation between the two persons of the\nTrinity is analogous to that which holds between an ointment and the\nexhalation which is homoousios with it\n(Pamphilus, Apology 99–104; see Edwards 1998). Thus he\ncan make oblique use of a term which he cannot predicate directly of\nincorporeals; Plotinus, who could have done so, could not have said\nthat nous was homoousios with the One because the\nlatter is superior to ousia.which can be posited only at the\nlevel of nous.   \n\nAlthough the Son is not “from the ousia” of the\nFather, he is said in the Latin translation of Origen’s Commentary\non Hebrews to be ex substantia patris, from\nthe hypostasis of the Father. That hypostasis,\nnot ousia, was the original noun in Greek can be deduced from\nthe text of Hebrews 1.3, where the Son is described as an impression\nof his [the Father’s] hypostasis. Here\nhypostasis appears\nto signify the reality disclosed by a phenomenon; the formula ex\nsubstantia patris was already axiomatic for Origen’s African\ncontemporary Tertullian (Against Praxeas 7.9). In Latin of\nthis period substantia was used indifferently to represent\nboth hypostasis and ousia; these Greek terms are not\nexplicitly distinguished in Origen’s writings, though he refrains from\nattributing either one ousia or three to the Godhead.  Some\ndifference in concreteness is implied by his strictures on those who\nfail to qualify the ousia of the Son and thus deny him\na hypostasis altogether (CommJoh 1.24.152): it seems, then\nthat the hypostasis is a specific determination of the more\ngeneric ousia. Origen stipulates in his treatise On\nPrayer (15.1) that the Son should not receive the prayer of\nadoration which is offered to the Father because he differs from the\nFather in ousia and in substrate (hupokeimenon); the\nlatter word is best understood with reference to the body that he\nassumed in the incarnation, and we cannot therefore be sure whether\nthe ousia of which Origen speaks is that of the exalted\nChrist in his eternal or his human character. It is generally true\nthat he takes fewer pains than later Christian authors to winnow what\nis said of the Son as second person of the Trinity from what is said\nof him as Jesus of Nazareth. When he compares the Father to a statue\nof infinite magnitude and the Son to a smaller statue accommodated to\nour perceptions, he begins as though the visible were a metaphor for\nthe invisible, but ends by quoting Philippians 2.7 on the\nmanifestation of Christ in the form of a slave (Princ.\n1.2.6). \n\nOrigen strongly affirms the ontological dependence of the Spirit, or\nthird hypostasis of the Trinity, on the second. To say otherwise would\nbe to deny that he was brought into being, since the author of all\nthat was brought into being, according to John 1.3, is the Son or\nLogos. It would be truer, however, to say that the Spirit did not come\ninto being without the Son than that he came into being through him\n(CommJohn 2.12.17–19). The Spirit,\nas hypostasis, is not only eternal but incorporeal in the\nstrictest sense: this follows from First Principles 1.6.4,\nwhere Origen finds it impossible to imagine that any being apart from\nthe members of the Trinity can subsist without a body. If these\npersons were incorporeal only in the looser sense that Origen\nrecognises in First Principles, proem 10, he could not have\ndrawn such an antithesis between the Godhead and the angelic\ncreation. The powers and operations of the Spirit are not so clearly\ndelineated in his writings, as those of the other two persons; the\nsame could be said of almost any writer before Nicaea, and the cause,\nno doubt, is the absence of unanimity in the scriptures. It is the\nSpirit who moves (or broods) on the face of the waters before creation\nat Genesis 1.2; at John 1.3 the Logos supplants the Spirit, which is\nnow said at John 7.39 to have been given only when Jesus was glorified\nat the end of his ministry. Origen follows John when he writes that\nthe Father is at work in the entire creation, the Son in those beings\nwho possess logos or reason, and the Spirit in the elect\n(Justinian, To Menas; cf. Princ. 1.3.5). It may be\nthat this restriction of the Son’s office implies a Greek rather than\na biblical understanding of the term logos, but Greek thought\nknows of no supernal being who acts in the realm assigned by Origen to\nthe Spirit (pace Dillon 1982). This Trinitarian hierarchy has\nbeen compared with that of the noetic principles being, life and mind\nin the system of Proclus, for whom being encompasses all that exists,\nlife the more limited sphere of living creatures and mind the still\nmore limited sphere of the rational. The correspondence, however, is\nfar from exact, and, as Proclus wrote two centuries after Origen and\nunder later influences, more compelling arguments will be required\nbefore we assign to a Platonic source the doctrine that Origen draws\nso effortlessly from the scriptures. No evidence has been produced to\nshow that the Spirit functions in Origen as the soul of the world; he\nsurmises on one occasion that the Logos is the soul of God\n(Princ. 2.8.5), but only because he needs to account for an\nanthropomorphic metaphor at Psalm 84.6.  . \n\nThat the Godhead is incorporeal—and therefore, in Origen’s\nlexicon, immaterial—is, as we have seen, an unassailable premiss\nof his theology. If the second person has any substrate—any\nmatter, as we might say—it is the will of God the Father. The\nsignificance of this doctrine becomes apparent when we recall that\nChrist is wisdom and that in the myth attributed to the Gnostic\nPtolemaeus, the error of wisdom lies in her acting without the assent\nof her consort Thelema, or Will (Irenaeus, Against Heresies\n1.1–4). The Father’s will, on the other hand, is not the substrate but\nthe cause of the material universe, which Origen held, with every\northodox Christian of his day, to have been created out of\nnothing. For most Christians this did not entail that God creates\nwithout matter, but that the matter from which he shaped the world was\nthe first of his creations. Matter had seldom been defined in\nChristian prose before Origen, but for him, as for Aristotle, as he\nhas often been interpreted, it is the unqualified receptacle of all\nqualities, a mere potentiality for existence in contradistinction to\nessence, of which nothing can be predicated until it is actualised as\ndeterminate being. But then follows Bishop Berkeley’s question: if\nmatter is not something, why not conclude that it is nothing? Origen\nis perhaps the first extant writer who informs us that this question\nhad been posed in his time, though in his accustomed manner he neither\naffirms it at First Principles 4.4.7 nor names its\nproponents. We must say “perhaps”, because the\nPhilokalia, a florilegium of his writings, contains a short\ndialogue in which the redundancy of matter is established by Socratic\ninterrogation (Philokalia 24). In view of his diffidence in\nFirst Principles, it seems more likely that this text is the\nwork of Maximus, a second-century author to whom it is also attributed\nin our manuscripts. \n\nIt is clear at least that Origen’s God creates the world from nothing\nand without toil or opposition (Princ.2.1.5). Because he\nasserts that such a world will inevitably be finite, as God himself\ncannot comprehend the infinite, Origen was later accused of slighting\nthe omnipotence of the Creator. His meaning, however, is not that\nthere are limits to the power of God, but that any particular exercise\nof it must logically have some limit. The infinite is by nature\nincomprehensible; hence it is no shortcoming in God that he cannot\ncomprehend it, and he remains omnipotent in the sense that there is no\nfinite enterprise that lies beyond his power. In contrast to the\nGnostics, therefore, who held that our world is the residue of a\nrupture or fall within the Godhead, Origen maintains that a singe God\nis the creator of both the intellectual and the material cosmos. He\nalso purports to demonstrate the priority of the intellectual Adam to\nthe material Adam, first by giving an allegorical sense to the\nfirmament which divides the waters at Genesis 1.7, then by a literal\nreading of Genesis 1.26–2.22. In this text the creation of\nhumanity as male and female in the image of God, as the crown of his\nhandiwork, is succeeded by a narrative of quite a different tenor, in\nwhich God fashions the body of the first man from the soil and then,\nafter populating the garden with beasts and plants and infusing the\nspirit into his nostrils, derives the body of the first woman from his\nrib (Genesis 2.1–7; 2.21–25). It is not clear whether a\ntemporal, as well as an ontological, priority is accorded to the inner\nman, or whether the protoplasts owe their creation to his fall. \n\nThat the denizens of the present world have sinned, and will sin\nagain, is a ubiquitous premiss of Origen’s theodicy.  Misadventures\nwhich the world ascribes to fortune, fate or the malice of our\nsuperhuman guardians will always in fact be trials of virtue,\nchastisements for sin (perhaps forgotten) or correctives to hidden\ninjustice. If the ways of providence remain elusive—if we cannot\ndivine why God loved Jacob and hated Esau—the explanation must\nlie in causes prior to the birth of Jacob or the entry of his brother\ninto the womb. These are the most positive intimations in Origen’s\nextant works of a doctrine freely ascribed to him by his ancient\ncritics, according to which all rational beings were once pure\nintellects in the presence of God, and would have remained so for ever\nhad they not fallen away through koros or satiety. Each of\nthe delinquents, we are told, received a body corresponding to the\ngravity of the original sin: those who fell least became angels, those\nwho fell most became demons, and human souls constitute order in\nkeeping with the mediocrity of their transgressions (Antipater of\nBostra at Patrologia Graeca 96.504–505). This account\nof Origen’s teaching was already known to Augustine, who perceived its\nincoherence, since it implies that the bodies of demons, who inhabit\nthe air above us, are grosser than ours. In the form that is now\ncanonical, it is a bricolage of Platonic myths recounting the fall of\nthe soul from the “supercelestial place”, the peculiarly\nChristian and anti-Platonic concept of the demons as fallen angels,\nand Philo’s opinion that koros is the cause of the soul’s\nestrangement from its maker (Heir of Divine Things 240). If Origen\nheld such a theory, it was not on the Platonic ground that soul, as\nthe cause of motion, cannot be brought into being and hence must be\nimmortal; his object, typically Christian, is to vindicate biblical\nteaching and at the same time to show that it cannot be used to\nsupport any Gnostic or pagan animadversion on divine\njustice. Accordingly (though some of his ancient critics pretended\notherwise), his writings are unequivocal in their rejection of Plato’s\ntheory of transmigration, whether from human to human or from human to\nbeast; although these theories (hesitantly accepted even by Platonists\nin the third century), gain some colour from Jewish traditions about\nElijah and from punishments meted out to animals under the Levitical\nlaw, Origen bows to the wisdom of the church, which declares them\ninadmissible (CommJohn 1.11.66; Princ. 1.8.5). \n\nCertainly at First Principles 1.4.1 he writes that satiety is\nthe commonest cause of falling, but the soul of which he speaks may be\nan embodied one, as it is when it repents a few lines later\n(Princ. 1.4.1). At First Principles 3.5.6, and again\nin his fragmentary commentary on Ephesians, he interprets the\nnoun katabolê at Ephesians 1.4 as an allusion to the\nsoul’s descent to a body from the hand of God; but this descent, which\nis not a fall, is not said to coincide with the creation. We read that\nthe soul of Christ adhered to the word with indissoluble love ab\ninitio creationis, but these words could signify either\n“from the beginning of the creation” or “from the\nbeginning of its creation”\n(Princ. 2.6.3–4). At First Principles 1.7.1 we\nare said to be properly identical with our rational element; but\nGregory of Nyssa and Augustine said the same without being understood\nto mean that we have ever existed as disembodied souls. When Origen\nsurmises that Esau was expiating the sins of his former life, we\ncannot assume that he was ignorant of rabbinic speculations on the\nsins that Esau committed in the womb; when he refers elsewhere to\ncauses preceding Esau’s entry into the womb, these causes may not\ninclude any act on the part of Esau’s soul\n(Princ. 3.1.22). That merit can be ascribed to a human being\nin the foetal state is evident from the leaping of John the Baptist in\nElizabeth’s womb when he recognises the child in the womb of Mary\n(Princ. 1.7.4). In his exegesis of John 1.31, Origen suggests\nthat the Baptist deplores his failure to recognise Jesus at the River\nJordan because he has already known him in a previous life; since,\nhowever, he was prepared to entertain the theory that the Baptist was\nan angel embodied for our sake, we cannot deduce that Origen credited\nall souls with a sentient existence before their entry into this world\n(CommJohn 2.31.186). That the elements are ensouled can be\ninferred from Isaiah 1.2, where God calls heaven and earth to witness;\nand Job’s exclamation, “the stars are not clean in his\nsight” is applied by Origen to the sun and moon, who have been\nmade “subject to vanity” for the sake of those who inhabit\nthe physical cosmos (Princ. 1.7.2). Here it may be true that\nhe borrows a tenet from the Platonists, but not without biblical\nwarrant, and the uncleanness of the sun and moon is a consequence of\ntheir voluntary enthralment, not its cause (see further Scott\n1994). \n\nIn Origen’s extant writings, then, the doctrine of the soul’s fall\nthrough satiety, after centuries of beatitude as a “pure\nintellect”, is never so clearly stated as in later indictments\nof his heterodoxy. Many hold none the less that the charges are true,\nand that Origen’s advocacy of these doctrines is concealed from us by\nthe loss or mutilation of the incriminating texts.  Others, relying\nchiefly on the texts that have been preserved, maintain that for\nOrigen the fall of souls was a tentative and occasional speculation or\na myth, in Plato’s sense, that was later mistaken for a dogma (Harl\n1987). It has also been argued that his preserved words testify only\nto Origen’s belief in the fall of angels (Princ. 1.5.3) and\nto the creation of the soul before its descent into the body; on this\nview, readers who came to his work with formulaic expectations mingled\nhis own opinions with the Platonic tenets to which they bore a\ncalculated but incomplete resemblance. No hypothesis has yet accounted\nfor all that is said in the surviving corpus of Origen’s works.  If,\nas Origen seems to hold(Princ. 3.6.1), the likeness of God\nwas not yet conferred on the intellectual man who was created in the\nimage of God, should we infer that Adam’s body was given to him as a\nmeans of acquiring the likeness, just as the Neoplatonist Porphyry,\nfifty years later, taught that souls are implanted in bodies in order\nto cultivate virtue through the struggle against temptation?  On the\nother hand, if our initial state was in some respects unlike the\npresent one, we may find it hard to interpret Origen’s dictum that the\nend, or consummation (apokatastasis), is “the same as\nthe beginning” (Princ. 1.6.2). The provenance of the\nnoun apokatastasis is more easily established than its\nmeaning, for even in the New Testament it may signify not so much the\nrestoration of that which was once the case as the realisation of that\nwhich ought to be (see further Tzamalikos 2007: 237–356; Ramelli\n2013: 129–221). \nAt First Principles 4.4.1 Origen scoffs that only a fool would suppose\nthat God had really planted a garden in Eden, as the second chapter of\nGenesis records. This has been taken to mean that he regards Eden not\nas a physical locality but as the state in which all souls enjoy the\npresence of God before they descend to bodies (Martens, 2013). Yet\nOrigen’s chief concern here is to forestall the literal reading of the\nverb “planted”, which, like other anthropomorphisms in scripture, is\nlikely to mislead a recent convert from idolatry unless he hears this\ncaveat. No critic infers, from Origen’s denial that God descended in a\nbodily sense to destroy the tower of Babel (Against Celsus\n4.15–21), that he believes the tower itself to be fictitious; we\nshould therefore not be too ready to assume, with the malignant\nEpiphanius, that he denies the historicity of the when he adopts a\nmetaphorical construction of God’s sewing of coats of skin for Adam\nand Eve at Genesis 3.21 (Epiphanius, Panarion 64.4.1; cf Heidl, 2003:\n138).In a fragment preserved in a Greek catena, he cites Adam’s\nexclamation “This is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh at Genesis\n2.24 as proof that even before the fall he possessed a body”\n(Commentary on Genesis, Fr. 22, p. 190 Metzler); from the\nsequel, as from Homilies on Leviticus 6.2, we may conclude\nthat he held this body to be a different texture from ours, but in his\nown parlance this would be an instance of “homonymy”, the use of a\nscriptural term in different senses which are equally literal. While\nthe sin of Adam is a for all subsequent transgressions in his\nCommentary on Romans, his argument does not preclude, and has\neven been thought to presuppose, the physical descent of all human\nbeings from this one ancestor (Bammel, 1989); at Against\nCelsus 7.39 the protoplasts fall from a state of immediate\nknowledge of God to one in which the mind is blinded by the senses but\nnothing is said to imply that they then became corporeal agents for\nthe first time. Of course many ambiguities remain, and grammar alone\nwill not determine whether the phrase “all saints who have lived since\nthe foundation of the world” (Martens, 2013: 532)implies that every\nsoul has existed from the beginning or only that from the beginning to\nthe present new souls are coming into existence with their\nbodies.  \n\n However the soul’s detention in the present world is accounted for,\nits freedom to choose its own goods, and its own god, is an\nindefeasible premiss of Origen’s philosophy. Astrologers who pretend\nto read our fates from the stars can be answered with a quip from\nEpicurus: if all that comes to pass is predestined, so is the belief\nin predestination, and we therefore have no reason to think it true\n(Philokalia 25.4). Even if they vouchsafe some premonitions\nof the future to the saints, we are not to suppose that they are the\ncauses of what they signify, or that God, who inscribes his own\nknowledge in the stars, is the author of everything that he\nforesees. Because he is exempt from time, our future lies open to him\nas the past and present lie open; he knows, in the words of Paul,\nwhether each of his creatures is to be a vessel of honour or a vessel\nof dishonour. It is we, however, who make his knowledge true by our\nown choice of good or evil; the Gnostics misconstrue the apostle’s\nstatement that God “makes” us vessels of honour or\ndishonour when they argue that the damned and the elect are of\ndifferent natures. None of us is born virtuous but each of us (as\nAristotle says and common experience goes on telling us) has the power\nto advance in virtue by performing virtuous acts (Princ.\n3.1). \n\nNevertheless, since the fall has darkened our minds and subjected our\nbodies to corruption, we cannot effect our own salvation without the\nassistance of God’s word made flesh. For Origen the virgin birth is a\ndatable event, an appropriation by the Word of full humanity in body,\nsoul and spirit. The union can be described as an anakrasis\nor mixture (Cels. 3.41), a voluntary cleaving of the flesh or\nsoul to the Word, and (in defiance of chemical facts) as the\nsublimation of the humanity by the divinity, as iron loses its form\nwhen held in an incandescent flame (Princ.  2.6.4) The\nhumanity, for all that, is not annihilated, and Christ can speak at\ntimes as man and at others with God without being guilty of\ndissimulation (CommJohn 19.2.6). His own words “my soul\nis sorrowful unto death” reveals his possession of a soul, which\nmediates between the flesh and the divinity which would otherwise\ndestroy it. While the soul (for Christ as for us) is invariably the\nseat of passion, some of his passions originate in his spirit, which,\nthough human, is divinely irradiated by the Word. By virtue of this\nirradiation, he foresees his own death, and his prescience gives rise\nnot to a commotion of the spirit but to a\ncommotion in the spirit, which is experienced as a\npassion of the soul (CommJohn\n32.18.221–224). The body which clothes him before the\ncrucifixion is as palpable as ours, and equally vulnerable to physical\naffections. After his resurrection, he does not show himself to\nCaiaphas and Pilate because he is visible only to the eye of faith\n(Cels. 2.60–65). This means not, however, that his body\nis no real body, but that it no longer suffers the consequences of the\nfall. \n\nThe blood of Christ, first in his circumcision and then on the Cross,\nis a ransom paid to Satan (Commentary on Romans 2.13.29;\ncf. 1Corinthians 6.23), whose prisoners we become, willingly if\nunwittingly, when we allow his image to oust that of god in our souls\n(Genesis Homilies 1.13). Yet Satan is never master of our\nwills: if he enters the soul of a Judas Iscariot, it is because the\nthought that he plants there has received assent and ripened into a\nsinful disposition (CommJohn 32.281–285; see further\nLayton 2004: 129–131.) We are taught to suppress such thoughts\nand to refrain from sin, by the teaching of Christ, the chief of his\nbounties during his earthly sojourn, which we now receive in even\ngreater measure through the scriptures. As the primordial Word of God,\nhe is present in every word from God that the church has canonised\nunder the direction of the Spirit; the many words of scripture, in\nfact, are one (Philokalia 5.4). When we are instructed to eat\nthe flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, it is clear that the\nwords cannot be taken literally; while Origen does not deny the\nallusion to the eucharist, he argues that the higher sense—but\nalso the quotidian sense—of the saying is that believers must\ndraw nourishment from the scriptures in which Christ “as it\nwere, takes flesh and speaks with a literal voice” in order to\ndraw us on to the invisible mysteries (Cels. 4.15; On\nPrayer 27.10–14). The scriptures, then, are the daily bread\nfor which Christians are taught to pray; to accept eating as a\nmetaphor for reading is to acknowledge that whenever the scriptures\nspeak of tasting, hearing or seeing God, they are not only imparting\nwhat we might call a spiritual sense to these words, but appealing to\nour own spiritual senses (Princ. 1.1.9), the loftier\nfaculties which were freely exercised by Adam and Eve before the fall\n(Cels.  7.39; see further Rahner 1979). \n\nTo distinguish only two senses of scripture is to forget that Christ,\nthe true Word, became incarnate in a threefold human\nnature. At First Principles 4.2.4, Origen asserts that the\nbody, the soul and the spirit in the human reader find their\nrespective analogues in the text of scripture. The body is the plain\ntext, whether narrative or didactic, construed according to common\ngrammatical or semantic norms.  The spirit, which must generally be\nsought beneath the surface, acquaints us with the work of Christ and\nthe mysteries of faith, and thus corresponds to the typological sense\nin mediaeval and modern exegesis. The soul of scripture is illustrated\nby Paul’s translation of the Mosaic precept, “thou shalt not\nmuzzle the ox which treadeth the corn”, to ministers of the\nchurch (Princ. 4.2.6). For this reason, and because the\nchurch is the bride of Christ in Origen’s psychic reading of the Song\nof Songs, the term “ecclesiastical” has been applied to\nthis intermediate plane of reference. In works which survive in Latin\ncertain passages are said to be amenable to a literal, a moral and a\nspiritual exposition, but we cannot say whether Origen would have\ncommended this translation. It is possible that he offers us a further\nclue to the content of the psychic sense in the prologue to\nhis Commentary on the Song of Songs (ed. Baehrens 1925: 75),\nwhere he argues that each of the three books ascribed to Solomon in\nthe Hebrew canon corresponds to a branch of Greek philosophy, and also\nto one stage in the believer’s progress from the foothills to the\nsummit of understanding. Ethics is represented in this itinerary by\nProverbs, physics by Ecclesiastics, the science of contemplation\n(theorics, epoptics or enoptics) by the Song). The first of these\ntexts is phrased and may be understood somatically; the third, in\nwhich Solomon forgoes his own name and becomes the bridegroom, lifts\nthe veil between the enlightened soul and her Redeemer (see further\nKing 2005: 222–263). If we pursue this seductive analogy, the\nsecond book of Solomon, which reveals our place in the cosmos, is a\nmine of cosmological or sapiential teaching which may be said to\nrepresent the soul of scripture. \n\nThis pattern would appear to have been suggested not by the usual\ndivision of philosophy into ethics, physics and logic, but by a\npassage in the Stromateis of Clement of Alexandria, where\nthree edifying senses are accorded to the scriptures, the last of\nwhich is the epopteia, or discernment of the\nmysteries. Origen may also have been aware that certain teachers had\nsorted Plato’s dialogues into different categories, each suited to a\ndifferent level of aptitude in the pupil (Edwards 1997). In\nattributing this taxonomy to the Hebrew king, however, he is making a\nclaim for the chronological primacy of the scriptures. No Platonist\nbefore him had undertaken a sustained allegorical reading of any text,\nas Porphyry confessed when he inaccurately charged him with forcing\nStoic techniques of exegesis on a barbarous text (Eusebius, Church\nHistory 6.19).  Commenting line by line on a sacred text was not,\nso far as our evidence goes, a typical enterprise for a Stoic.  Among\nthe Greeks the commentator who most resembles Origen is Alexander of\nAphrodisias; his concern, however, is to smooth the surface of\nAristotle, not to dig beneath it (see further Bendinelli\n1997). Origen’s true predecessor is Philo of Alexandria, who had\nteased moral and metaphysical profundities from the Torah, verse by\nverse, in order to demonstrate that nothing taught among the Greeks\nhad been concealed from the Lawgiver of the Jews (see further Dawson\n1992). \n\nPhilo is called a mystic because of passages which thirstily\nanticipate the mind’s bacchanalian ecstasy in the presence of the\nineffable. For Origen the term mystikos denotes the most\narcane sense of the scriptures, and the encounter with the Bridegroom,\n“which no-one can understand who has not experienced it”,\nis described in his Homilies on the Song of Songs (I.7\n[ed. Baehrens 1925: 39]). Whether it is a true ecstasy or a sense of\nhermeneutic illumination (Louth 2000: 69), this transient rapture\nforeshadows the culmination of the soul’s journey after death, when\nGod will at last be all in all. In answer to the jibes of Celsus,\nOrigen asserts that, while the church teaches the resurrection of the\nbody, the “spiritual body” of which Paul speaks will be of\na rarer and hence more durable texture than the gross flesh which now\nensheathes the soul (Cels. 5.18–5.23). In a dialogue\nwhich now survives only in excerpts, the soul is said to retain\nthe eidos, or form, of the body, perhaps a counterpart to the\ntenuous vehicle which the soul carries into the afterlife in the\neschatology of some Platonists (Methodius, On the\nResurrection 22 [ed. Bonwetsch 1899: 93]; see further Schibli\n1992). Most souls, having failed to purge their sins in this life,\nwill be required to pass the flaming sword that bars the entrance to\nthe earthly paradise (see further Crouzel 1972).  Once its cleansing\nthere is complete, the soul will pass through the seven planetary\nspheres, acquiring a more comprehensive knowledge of the cosmos and\nour place in it than is vouchsafed to us in this world\n(Princ. 1.11.6). Once again, kindred notions can be found in\nPlatonic and Hermetic literature; the posthumous itinerary mirrors the\ntransition from the ethical to the sapiential teachings of Solomon,\nand we see here in an inchoate form the purgative and illuminative\nways of the western mystical tradition.  A body of some kind is\npresupposed by this celestial topography; nevertheless, at the point\nwhere God becomes all in all, we hear nothing of a body, but only that\nsoul will be entirely subsumed in spirit. Some scholars hold that a\nbody must be either retained or imparted to us, since only the persons\nof the Trinity can subsist without one (e.g., Crouzel 1980); others,\ninvoking the maxim that the end will be like the beginning, argue that\nwe shall return to the incorporeal state in which we were first\ncreated (e.g., Scott 2012). In any case, this union with God appears\nto correspond to the last stage in the perusal of the Solomonic canon,\nand to the “unitive way” of the mystic in later Christian\nliterature.  \n\nThis purgatory after death is not confined to those who have died at\npeace with God; if any should fail to be saved, it is not because the\nopportunity to repent has been withdrawn, but because the soul has\nbecome so brutish that it is incapable of amendment (Princ.\n1.5.5). This is the only truth that Origen thinks can be ascribed to\nPlato’s doctrine of transmigration into beasts (Princ.\n3.4.3), and it cannot be presumed that even the demons will remain\nobdurate for ever. Commenting on Paul’s promise that “the last\nenemy, death” will be vanquished, Origen surmises that death\nwill not be annihilated but will cease to molest the saints\n(Princ. 3.6.5). It is generally assumed that the proper\nsubject of this passage is the devil, and the word diabolus\ndoes indeed occur in a ninth-century quotation\n(Eriugena, Periphyseon, Patrologia Latina 122, 930C). On the other hand,\nin a letter to his friends in Alexandria, Origen is said to have\nexclaimed that only a lunatic would prophesy the salvation of the\ndevil (Crouzel 1973). Perhaps he means only that Satan is not destined\nfor beatitude; this need not preclude his release from torment on the\nlast after his peaceful acquiescence in the victory of God (see\nEdwards 2010). \n\nBy convention Origen is a “Christian Platonist of\nAlexandria”. In fact, his native city was only intermittently\nhis place of residence; on the other hand, his intellectual home\nthroughout his life was one in which Plato was never his compatriot\nbut an honoured guest. There is no doubt that he knew the works of the\ngreat Athenian intimately, and credited him at times with more than a\nsuperficial grasp of the highest truths. Nevertheless, no Greek\nphilosopher possessed for him the authority that he accorded to the\nscriptures; Plato was only the most prominent of the dead pagans who\nassisted him in the exegesis and harmonisation of this infallible\ntext. The work in which Origen makes most frequent reference to Plato,\nhis reply to Celsus, as noted above, is also the one in which he\nasserts that Christ takes flesh in the written word, disclosing\nmysteries that no human intellect has fathomed without revelation\n(Cels. 4.15), He was never troubled, as a mediaeval schoolman\nmight be, by a conflict between ecclesiastical dogma and the best\nthought of the ancients, because the Word who taught the ancients from\nafar is, for him, the daily shepherd of the Church.","contact.mail":"mark.edwards@theology.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"theology.ox.ac.uk"}]
