By calling\nthemselves skeptics, the ancient skeptics thus describe themselves as\ninvestigators. They also call themselves ‘those who\nsuspend’ (ephektikoi), thereby signaling that their\ninvestigations lead them to suspension of judgment. They do not put\nforward theories, and they do not deny that knowledge can be found. At\nits core, ancient skepticism is a way of life devoted to\ninquiry. Also, it is as much concerned with belief as with\nknowledge. As long as knowledge has not been attained, the skeptics\naim not to affirm anything. This gives rise to their most\ncontroversial ambition: a life without belief.\n\n\n\nAncient skepticism is, for the most part, a phenomenon of\nPost-Classical, Hellenistic philosophy. The Academic and Pyrrhonian\nskeptical movements begin roughly in the third century BCE, and end\nwith Sextus Empiricus in the second century CE. Hellenistic philosophy\nis a large-scale conversation, not unlike philosophy today. The\nskeptics (among them Pyrrho, Timon, Arcesilaus, Carneades,\nAenesidemus, and Sextus Empiricus) do engage with Pre-Socratic\nphilosophy, Socrates, Protagorean relativism, Plato, and perhaps\nAristotle. But their contemporary and principal interlocutors are\nEpicureans, Stoics, Cynics, and Megarian logicians (cf. Long 2006,\nch. 4 and 5).\n\n\n\nThe core concepts of ancient skepticism are belief, suspension of\njudgment, criterion of truth, appearances, and investigation. Important\nnotions of modern skepticism such as knowledge, certainty, justified\nbelief, and doubt play no or almost no role. This is not to say that\nthe ancients would not engage with questions that figure in today’s\nphilosophical discussions. Ancient debates address questions that today\nwe associate with epistemology and philosophy of language, as well as\nwith theory of action, rather than specifically with the contemporary\ntopic of skepticism. They focus on the nature of belief, the way in\nwhich belief figures in our mental lives, and the relationship of\nbelief to speech and action. \n\nPre-Socratic philosophers formulate—often in the context of\nrevisionist metaphysical theories, which lead into epistemological\ndiscussions—such claims as “nothing is known” (Lee\n2010). The firm assertion, as found in these philosophers’\nworks, that there is no knowledge can be turned against itself: does\nthe proponent of “nothing is known” claim to know that\nnothing can be known (and if not, why assert it)? This question gives\nrise to a puzzle that remains at the heart of ancient debates about\nskepticism. Can the skeptics say anything meaningful about their\nphilosophy without asserting anything about how things are (Bett\n2013)? Skeptical writings have a peculiar format, one that comes with\nits own challenges: the skeptics aim to describe their philosophy\ntout court, as they practice it, without laying out any\nparticular theories or doctrines. Skeptical ideas have been charged\nwith a family of objections: they might be self-refuting,\ninconsistent, self-contradictory, and so on (Castagnoli 2010). Another\nline of objection is associated with Hume, namely that “nature\nis always too strong for principle.” As Hume puts it, “a\nPyrrhonian cannot expect that his philosophy will have any constant\ninfluence on the mind” (part 2 of section 12, “Of the\nAcademical or Sceptical Philosophy,” An Enquiry Concerning\nHuman Understanding, London, 1748). It is one thing for\nskepticism to be coherent. It is another thing for it to be likely\nthat anyone, no matter how much they rehearse skeptical arguments in\ntheir mind, will succeed in adhering to it (Johnson 2001), as ancient\nPyrrhonist philosophers claimed to be able to do. \n\nLike later epistemologists, the ancient skeptics start from\nquestions about knowledge. But discussion quickly turns to beliefs\n(Fine 2000). The Greek term translated here as belief, doxa,\ncan also be translated as opinion. The root of doxa is\ndokein, seeming. In a belief, something seems so-and-so to\nsomeone. But there is also an element of judgment or acceptance. The\nrelevant verb, doxazein, often means ‘to judge that something\nis so-and-so.’ Hellenistic discussions envisage three attitudes that\ncognizers take to impressions (how things seem to them): assent,\nrejection, and suspension of judgment (epochê). \n\nSuspension is a core element of skepticism: the skeptic suspends\njudgment. However, if this means that the skeptic forms no beliefs\nwhatsoever, then skepticism may be a kind of cognitive suicide.\nArguably, belief-formation is a basic feature of human cognitive\nactivity. It is not clear whether one can lead an ordinary human life\nwithout belief, or indeed, ancient opponents of the skeptics say,\nwhether one can even survive. Perhaps even the simplest actions, such\nas eating or leaving a room without running into a wall, involve\nbeliefs (on the practical side of ancient skepticism, see Annas-Barnes\n1985, 7; Burnyeat 1980). It is also hard to say whether someone who\nsucceeded in not forming any beliefs could communicate with others,\nwhether they could engage in philosophical investigation, or whether they\ncould even think at all. \n\nThe ancient skeptics are well aware of these objections. The most\nwidely discussed charge is that they cannot act without belief\n(Apraxia Charge). In response, the skeptics describe their actions\nvariously as guided by the plausible, the convincing, or by\nappearances. The notion of appearances gains great importance in\nPyrrhonian skepticism, and poses difficult interpretive questions\n(Barney 1992). When something appears so-and-so to someone, does this\nfor the skeptics involve some kind of judgment on their part?  Or do\nthey have in mind a purely phenomenal kind of appearing?  The\nskeptical proposals (that the skeptic adheres to the plausible, the\nconvincing, or to appearances) have in common their appeal to\nsomething less than full-fledged belief about how things are, while\nallowing something sufficient to generate and guide action. \n\nHowever, my claim that ancient skepticism is about belief, while modern\nskepticism is about knowledge, needs to be qualified. Ancient\nskepticism is not alone in being concerned with belief. Recall that\nDescartes speaks repeatedly of demolishing his opinions (for\nexample, Med 2:12,\nAT 7:18; cf. Broughton, 2002, 33–61).  Contemporary\nepistemology often pays equal attention to the notions of both\njustified belief and knowledge. The distinctive focus of ancient\nskepticism on belief becomes clearer once we consider a third concept\nthat figures centrally in ancient discussions: criterion of truth. It\nis a core ancient intuition that, if we cannot identify an impression\nas true, we should hold back from taking it to be true and from\nbelieving anything on the basis of it. The skeptics and their\nopponents discuss how one recognizes a true impression as true. Is\nthere anything about impressions of truths that marks them as true?\nAre there some evident things (some kind of impressions), which can be\nused as standards or criteria, so that nothing is to be accepted as\ntrue if it is not in agreement with these evident things? The Stoics\nand Epicureans formulate theories that conceive of such criteria. The\nskeptics respond critically to their proposals. Accordingly, the\nconception of a criterion of truth assumes as central a role in\nancient debates as does the notion of knowledge in modern\ndiscussions. This debate includes in-depth analysis of sense\nperception and its relation to belief. According to Epicurus, all\nsense perceptions are true, but judgments based on these perceptions\nare true or false (Striker 1977, Vogt 2016). The Stoics explore\ndifferences between sense perception, illusion, and hallucination\n(Vasiliou forthcoming). Their account of the criterion of truth starts\nfrom perceptual impressions that qualify, or fail to qualify, as\ncognitive (Shogry forthcoming-b). The Stoics propose that we should\naccept only cognitive impressions, and accordingly we should only form\nbeliefs based on a subset of true perceptual impressions. \n\nDiscussion of the criterion of truth arguably also covers some of\nthe ground that is later discussed in terms of certainty. The Stoics\nsay that a particular kind of impression is the criterion of truth: the\ncognitive impression. Cognitive impressions make it clear through\nthemselves that they reveal things precisely as they are. This notion\nis an ancestor to the later conception of clear and distinct\nimpressions, and thus, to discussions of certainty. \n\nConsider next the notion of doubt. Doubt is often considered the\nhallmark of skepticism. So how can it be that ancient skepticism is\nnot about doubt (Corti 2010, Vogt 2014a)? Insofar as ‘to\ndoubt’ means no more than ‘to call into question,’\nthe ancient skeptics might be described as doubting things.  However,\nskeptical investigation as Sextus Empiricus describes it does not\ninvolve doubt (I shall focus here on Pyrrhonism; on Cicero’s use\nof dubitari, see Section 3.3). Skeptics find themselves struck\nby the discrepancies among impressions. This experience is described\nas turmoil. They aim to resolve this disturbance by settling what is\ntrue and what is false among them. But investigation leads them to\nsuspension of judgment, which brings its own peace of mind\n(Outlines of Skepticism [= PH] 1.25–30). Where\nin this account should we locate doubt? Is the initial turmoil the\nancient skeptic experiences a kind of doubt? Are the ancient skeptic’s\ninvestigations a kind of doubting? Should we describe suspension of\njudgment as a kind of doubt?  All three stages may resemble doubt, at\nleast insofar as the ancient skeptics have not settled on answers to\nthe questions they investigate. But all three stages are also\ndifferent from doubt as it is conceived in later epistemology. The\nancient skeptics do not describe themselves as making an active effort\nat doubting what ordinarily they would believe, as some philosophers\nin the Cartesian tradition have it. Instead the ancient skeptics find\nthemselves in turmoil because of discrepancies in how things strike\nthem. Moreover, the progression that ancient skeptics describe differs\nfrom the doubt-belief model that later thinkers tend to employ. The\nancient skeptics improve their psychological condition by moving from\nturmoil to suspension of judgment, not by removing doubt. It seems\nbest, then, to refrain from invoking the modern conception of doubt as\nat all fundamental in the reconstruction of ancient Greek\nskepticism.  Some of the distinctness of ancient skepticism lies in the fact\nthat it is developed by philosophers who genuinely think of themselves\nas skeptics. In later epistemology, skepticism is largely construed\nfrom the outside. In particular, early modern skepticism is, for the\nmost part, conceived by philosophers who aim to refute it. But ancient\nskepticism is explored by skeptics, and that is, by philosophers who\nintend their lives to be reflective of their philosophy (Cooper 2012\nch.5.5–7; Bett 2013b). Socrates raises the challenge that it\nmight be truly bad (for one’s life, for the state of one’s soul, and\nso on) to base one’s actions on unexamined beliefs.  For all one\nknows, these beliefs could be false, and without investigation, one\ndoes not even aim to rid oneself of false belief, which is admittedly\na bad thing for one’s soul.  Only an examined life is worth living\n(Cooper 2007). Once we take this challenge seriously, as the ancient\nskeptics do, we embark on a kind of investigation that is seen as\ndirectly relevant to our lives. Our beliefs are assumed, at this\npre-skeptical phase, to be guiding our actions. Confidence in\nunexamined views seems misplaced. Others regularly disagree with\nus. With respect to even the most basic questions, such as whether\nthere is movement, or whether there are good and bad things, we face\nconflicting views. In favor of each view, some arguments can be\nadduced, some practices invoked, some experiences cited. These\nconflicting arguments, practices and experiences need to be\nexamined. But that just raises further views that are in conflict.  As\na consequence, suspension of judgment on every such question looks\nrationally mandatory. But it is also rational to persist in\ninvestigation. The skeptic is committed to a search for the truth, on\nvirtually all questions, even if this search repeatedly and\npredictably leads to suspension of judgment (Cooper 2012). \n\nThe early Greek philosophers develop distinctions between reality\nand appearances, knowledge and belief, and the non-evident and the\nevident. These distinctions form the framework in which skepticism can\nbe conceived. The idea that truth is seen and knowledge gained from\nsome perspective outside of the ordinary ways of mortal life, and that\nmortals rely on something lesser, be it the hear-say of fame, or signs,\nor appearances, runs through much of early Greek thought. However, few\nearly Greek thinkers seem to have had skeptical or proto-skeptical\ninclinations. Xenophanes and Democritus are perhaps the most prominent\napparent exceptions. \n\nXenophanes famously insists that all conceptions of the gods are\nanthropomorphic and culturally contingent (DK 21B14, B15). The\nEthiopians pray to gods who look like Ethiopians, the Thracians to\ngods who look like Thracians (B16). If horses and cows had hands, the\nhorses would draw pictures of gods that look like horses, and the cows\nwould draw gods as cows (B15). Xenophanes puts forward a number of\ntheological theses of his own. But he says that no man will know the\nclear truth about such matters. He makes a point that has lasting\nrelevance in discussions of skepticism: even if someone succeeded in\nsaying something that actually is the case, he himself would not know\nthis. Thus, all is belief (120: B34) (cf. Sassi 2011 on\ninterpretations of Xenophanes that influence the history of\nskepticism). \n\nAtomism—a theory which thrives in Hellenistic times as the\nphysical theory of Epicureanism, and is thus an interlocutor of\nskepticism—leads into difficult epistemological questions. The\natomist can argue that sense perceptions are explicable as complex\nevents, initiated by objects each one made up of a lot of atoms\nfloating in the void, from which atoms proceed and traverse the\nintervening space, and affect the senses. It is certain objects, made\nup by the atoms proceeding from the objects in question (filmy images)\nthat we actually perceive. We neither perceive ‘real\nreality’ (atoms and void), nor even macroscopic objects and\ntheir properties (for example, a square tower). Democritus seems to\nhave argued along these lines (SE M 7.135–9; cf. fr. 9,\nSE M 7.136; Theophrastus, De Sensibus 2.60–1,\n63–4), and accordingly his atomist view of perception can be\nseen as grounding a kind of proto-skepticism. \n\nDemocritus’ student Metrodorus of Chios says at the beginning of his\nbook On Nature “None of us knows anything, not even\nthis, whether we know or we do not know; nor do we know what ‘to\nnot know’ or ‘to know’ are, nor on the whole,\nwhether anything is or is not” (Cicero, Acad. 2.73;\ntrans. Lee (2010) = DK 70B1; SE M 7.48, 87–8; Eusebius,\nPraep. evang. 14.19.9).  This formulation reflects awareness\nof the fact that a simpler statement than the one reported in Cicero,\nsuch as “there is no knowledge,” can be turned against\nitself. In particular, Metrodorus recognizes the role that\nunderstanding concepts plays in any such statement. Does its proponent\nknow something, merely by virtue of understanding what the terms she\nuses in her philosophizing refer to? Sextus presents Metrodorus’\npronouncement as related to an enigmatic idea that he ascribes to two\nother philosophers, the Democritean Anaxarchus of Abdera and the Cynic\nMonismus (SE M 7.87–88). Both are said to have likened existing things\nto a stage-painting. This comparison, which Burnyeat captures in the\ncatch-phrase “all the world’s a stage-painting,” is\nopen to a range of interpretations (Burnyeat 2017). For Monismus,\nBurnyeat argues, it is likely to have had a moralistic upshot, along\nthe lines of “all is vanity.” In Democritean philosophy,\nand insofar as later skepticism recalls the saying, it is bound to be\na proposal in epistemology (or possibly epistemology and\nmetaphysics). \n\nThe 5th century sophists develop forms of debate which are\nancestors of skeptical argumentation. They take pride in arguing in a\npersuasive fashion for both sides of an issue. Similarly, they develop\nan agonistic art of refuting any claim put forward, exploiting the\npremises of their interlocutors and leading them into\ninconsistencies. Further, the sophists are interested in the contrast\nbetween nature and convention. The formative roles of custom and law\nwere discussed by some of the earliest Greek authors (consider\nPindar’s “law is king” and its many interpretations, for\nexample in Herodotus). The sophists explore the idea that, if things\nare different for different cultures, there may be no fact of the\nmatter of how those things really are. The skeptics engage with both\nlegs of the distinction between nature and convention. Pyrrhonian\nskepticism employs an argument to the effect that, if something is by\nnature F, it is F for everyone (affects everyone as\nF) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  Pyrrhonism further associates\nconvention with appearances, so that the sceptic, by adhering to\nappearances, can lead an ordinary life (see section 4). However, the\ncontrast between nature and convention does not figure importantly in\nancient skepticism, and there is no skeptical school that would\nconfine itself to ‘moral’ skepticism, or skepticism about\nvalues. \n\nSextus Empiricus, whose writings provide the most detailed extant\naccount of Pyrrhonian skepticism, emphasizes how strongly the skeptics\ndepart from all other philosophers. As he presents it, the\nPre-Socratics who put forward some of the views cited above are what\nhe calls dogmatists. They make claims about nature, reality,\nknowability, and so on. The second-most detailed extant account of\nPyrrhonian skepticism is offered by Diogenes Laertius, in\nhis Lives of Eminent Philosophers 9.61–116. It contains\na large number of references to early Greek poets and Pre-Socratic\nphilosophers, suggesting that these early thinkers formulate ideas\nthat are similar to skeptic ideas (§§61–73). It is\ncontroversial whether the skeptics Diogenes has in mind claim this\nancestry. Alternatively, other philosophers may have charged the\nskeptics with sharing ideas with non-skeptical thinkers, thereby\ndeparting from their non-dogmatic approach (Warren 2015). Either way, two observations seem\nrelevant. Contrary to a classic assessment of Diogenes’ report\nby Jonathan Barnes (1992), the sections of text in which connections\nare made between early Greek thought and skepticism may be worth\nexploring. Moreover, scholars may have paid too little attention to\nskepticism’s ancestry in poetry (Clayman 2009). Pyrrho seems to\nhave referred to Homer as a proponent of ideas he approves of, ideas\nabout change, the status of human rationality and language, and\nmore. \n\nThe Socrates of Plato’s Apology tries to solve a\npuzzle.  The Delphic oracle says that no one is wiser than\nSocrates. But Socrates does not think himself wise. He calls into\nquestion the truth of neither the oracle’s pronouncements nor\nhis self-perception.  Accordingly, he must figure out how both are\nconsistent with each other. In order to do so, Socrates talks to\nvarious groups of experts in Athens: politicians, poets, and\ncraftsmen. As it turns out, all of them think that they know something\nabout great and important things, but in fact, it seems clear to\nSocrates, they do not. When asked they cannot provide reasons for\nbelieving the things they claim to know that are rationally\nsatisfactory. Socrates knows that he does not know about these most\nimportant matters (megista; 22d); his interlocutors, it\nappears, do not know that they lack this knowledge. In this respect,\nSocrates is wiser than everyone else who has any general reputation\nfor wisdom. In the course of recounting his conversations with others,\nSocrates says something enigmatic: “About myself I knew that I\nknow nothing” (22d; cf. Fine 2008). The context of the dialogue\nallows us to read this pronouncement as unproblematical. Socrates\nknows that he does not know about important things. Interpreted in\nthis manner, Socrates does not appear to be a skeptic in the sense\nthat he would profess to know nothing. Even though some readers\n(ancient and modern) found such an extreme statement in the\nApology, a more plausible reading suggests that Socrates\nadvocates the importance of critically examining one’s own and others’\nviews on important matters, precisely because one does not know about\nthem (Vogt 2012a, ch. 1). Such examination is the only way to find\nout. \n\nSocrates’ commitment to reason—examination as the way to find\nout—inspires the skepticism of the Hellenistic Academy (Cooper\n2004b, Vogt 2013). One is bound to lead one’s life based on one’s beliefs, he\nassumes. Therefore, one ought to examine one’s beliefs, and abandon\nthose that one finds to be false. One ought to do so because otherwise one might\nlead a bad life. Socrates’ questioning is rooted in a concern with the\ngood life. Insofar as it is, one might think that the Socratic roots of\nancient skepticism lead one toward a kind of limited, wholly moral\nskepticism. However, Socrates’ examinations are not confined to value\nquestions. While ethical questions may be the starting-point, they\nimmediately lead to questions about the soul, the gods, knowledge, and\nso on. For Socrates and his Hellenistic followers, value questions\ncannot be insulated from questions of psychology, physics, and\nepistemology. \n\nAnother strand of skeptical thought begins with questions about the\nnature of philosophical investigation. In the Meno, Plato\nformulates a famous puzzle. How is investigation possible? We cannot\ninvestigate either what we know or what we do not know. In the former\ncase, there is no need to investigate, and besides, if we really do\nknow we already have in mind everything that investigation could\nreveal to us about the matter. In the latter case, we would not know\nwhat to look for, and we would not recognize it if we found it\n(80d-86c). So there is no room for investigating anything. Socrates\ncalls this an eristic argument, thus drawing attention to the fact\nthat this is a puzzle that sophists have put forward (cf. Plato’s\nEuthydemus). \n\nPlato’s solutions to this puzzle are difficult to assess (Fine\n2014). Learning is recollection, says one proposal (this is the one\nthat Socrates himself immediately offers). We already know, but only\nin some implicit way, what it takes investigation to come to know\nexplicitly.  This is the famous Anamnesis theory (81a-d). If we give\nup on investigation, we shall be lazy people, says another argument\n(81d-e).  A third solution of the puzzle arguably says that one of its\npremises is false. It is not the case that, for everything, we either\nknow it or are entirely ignorant of it. Rather, there is a third\nstate, namely belief (83a-86a). Investigation can begin from\nbeliefs. The Meno explores a mix of these solutions. Plato\ndevelops what he calls a hypothetical method (86c-100b). That is, the\ninterlocutors in some sense begin from their beliefs (for example,\n“virtue is good”). But they do not endorse them. They set\nthem up as hypotheses, and employ these hypotheses in investigation\n(on the relationship between Pyrrhonian skepticism and Plato’s and\nAristotle’s notions of hypothesis, cf. Corti 2011). \n\nPlato discusses and re-formulates several of the metaphysical\nconsiderations that back up proto-skeptical and early skeptical\nintuitions. The relevant passages are spread out over a number of\ndialogues, among which passages in the Phaedo,\nRepublic, Theaetetus and Timaeus are perhaps\nmost important. In these dialogues, Plato develops some of his own\nmetaphysical ideas. He also engages critically with metaphysical\ntheories that he does not ultimately adopt. However, in order to\nexplore these theories he formulates them in detail, often invoking a\nPre-Socratic ancestor as a proponent of a given idea. These discussions\nare a great source of inspiration for Pyrrhonian skeptics, who are\ninterested in what may be called a metaphysics of indeterminacy (Bett\n2000). \n\nIn contrasting the Forms with the perceptible realm, Plato discusses\nproperties. For example, for all sensible items, A is tall\nrelative to some B and short relative to\nsome C. There is no such thing as anything’s being\ntall simpliciter. When we call something tall, we measure it\nagainst something else, look at it from a particular perspective, and\nso on. As we might say, “tall” and “short” are\novertly relative predicates. But perhaps many more, or indeed all,\npredicates work that way, even where this is less obvious. Plato’s\narguments lead to the question of whether it is conceivable that all\nour predications are, in this particular sense, relative. If this were\nthe case, it might quite fundamentally upset our conception of the\nworld as furnished with objects that have properties.  Such\nconsiderations lead to another idea about properties in the perceptual\nrealm. If a fence is low and high, a cloud is bright and dark, a vase\nbeautiful and ugly, and so on, then it seems that, perhaps quite\ngenerally, perceptual things are F and not-F. Only\nthe Form of F is F (for example, only the Beautiful\nis beautiful). While the relevant passages are difficult to interpret,\nit is clear enough which line of thought comes to influence later\nskeptics. The skeptics engage with the idea that, if something appears\nto be F and not-F, it is not really (or: by nature)\neither F or not-F. \n\nIn the Timaeus, Plato argues that an account of the natural\nworld can only be ‘likely’: it is an eikôs\nlogos. Most generally speaking, the idea here is that certain\nexplananda are such that theorizing about them can do no more than\nmirror their, comparatively speaking deficient, nature. This idea has\nancestors in Xenophanes and Parmenides, and it plays a crucial role in\nthe Timaeus (Bryan 2012). Academic skeptics employ various\nnotions of the plausible and the convincing, thus developing further\nthis tradition, albeit no longer with the assumption that different\ndomains require different kinds of theorizing. \n\nIn the Theaetetus, Plato explores the kind of cultural\nrelativism that is associated with some sophists. In his examination\nrelativism is immediately extended to a general theory, not restricted\nto the domain of values. Socrates (as main speaker of the dialogue)\nascribes relativism to Protagoras, who is famous for saying that\n“man is the measure.” Socrates reformulates this claim as\nfollows: what appears to A is true for A, and what\nappears to B is true for B. On this premise,\nSocrates argues, there is no rational way to prefer our perceptions\nwhile awake to our perceptions while asleep, or similarly, to prefer\nsober to intoxicated or deranged perceptions.  In each state, our\nperceptions are true for us. Socrates analyzes relativism in several\nsteps, pointing to ever more radical implications. Along the way, he\nenvisages a moderate metaphysics of flux, where objects do not have\nstable properties. But eventually he points out that relativism is\ncommitted to an even starker revisionist metaphysics, radical\nflux. For it to be possible that what seems to A is true for\nA, and what seems to B is true for B, there\ncannot be a stable world that A and B both refer\nto. Rather, “everything is motion” (Tht.\n179c-184b). The skeptics employ versions of some of the arguments in\nthe Theaetetus, without, however, arriving at relativist\nconclusions. Schematically speaking, the relativist says that, if X is\nF for A and F* for B, then X is F-for-A and F*-for-B. Pyrrhonian\nskepticism of the variant found in Sextus reacts by continued\ninvestigation into whether X is F or F* (or both or neither). \n\nAristotle engages, at several points in his works, with the\nMeno Problem. For example, Aristotle points out that, for\nsuccessful investigation to proceed, one first needs a well-formulated\nquestion. One needs to know the knot in order to untie it. In order to\nknow what to look for and recognize it when one finds it, one needs to\nfirst think one’s way through the difficulties involved, and thereby\nformulate a question. If one does, then one shall be able to recognize\nthe solution once one hits upon it (Met. 3.1, 995a24–b4).\nThese ideas are highly relevant to Hellenistic discussions. The\nskeptic is an investigator, and one anti-skeptical charge says that,\nif indeed a skeptic knew nothing, they could not even formulate the\nquestions they investigate. Interpreters have emphasized a contrast\nbetween Aristotle and the skeptics. For Aristotle, formulating puzzles\nand thinking one’s way through them puts one in a better\nposition, such that one gets clear about how matters are. This may be\ndifferent for the skeptics: engagement with different angles of\nphilosophical problems leads them to suspension of judgment (Long\n2006, Code 2010). Other scholars argue that the skeptics’ way of\nthinking through puzzles improves their cognitive condition even\nthough they do not settle for an answer to a given question (Vogt\n2012a, ch. 5). Also, scholars point to modes of thinking in Plato and\nAristotle that are not primarily concerned with results. In\ncontemplation, a cognizer may think again and again through the same\nkinds of matters, and yet doing so presumably improves their cognitive\ncondition (Olfert 2014). \n\nIn Posterior Analytics I.1,\nAristotle says that all teaching and learning comes about through\nthings we already know. When we phrase questions, we already have\n‘That-Knowledge’ and ‘What-Knowledge.’ For\nexample, when we ask questions about triangles, we need to know that\nthere are triangles (otherwise we would not have questions about their\nproperties). We also need to have a notion of what triangles are (we\ndraw a triangle, not a square, when we phrase a question about its\nproperties). Another way in which Aristotle addresses\nthe Meno Problem conceives of particular perceptions as the\nstarting-points of investigation. Complex cognitive activities arise\nfrom simpler ones. Many particular perceptions lead to memory, to\nexperience, and eventually to expert understanding (Met. 1.1,\nAn. Post. II.19). With the generalizations of memory,\nexperience, and expertise comes the ability to investigate. With\nrespect to skepticism, the important point here is that the\nstarting-points of investigation are not themselves in need of\njustification. \n\nLike Plato, Aristotle engages with the Protagorean claim that, as\nAristotle puts it, all seemings (dokounta) and appearances\n(phainomena) are true (Met 4.5). If this were so,\nAristotle says, everything would have to be true and false at the same\ntime. Aristotle argues\nthat earlier thinkers arrived at such views because they identified\nbeing solely with the perceptual (4.5, 1010a1–3). Caught up in this\nassumption, they did not see who or what was going to judge between\nconflicting sense perceptions. For example, it seemed unsatisfactory\nto dismiss the views of sick and mad people simply on the grounds that\nthey are in the minority, thereby considering as true what appears to\nthe greater number of people. Similarly, Aristotle reports that these\nearlier thinkers looked at the ways in which things appear differently\nto different kinds of living beings, and to one person at different\ntimes (4.5, 1099b1–11). \n\nIn Metaphysics 4.4, Aristotle notes that some people consider\nit possible for the same thing to be and not to be, and for someone to\nbelieve so (he refers to a range of positions, all of which in some\nway are related to denial of the Principle of Non-Contradiction; see\nCastagnoli 2010, I.5.4). Against this, Aristotle says it is the\nfirmest of principles that things cannot be and not be at the same\ntime. To deny this shows a lack of training. With adequate training,\none recognizes for which things proof should be sought, and for which\nit ought not to be sought (see also An. Post. I.3).  It is\nimpossible that there be demonstration for everything. Otherwise\ndemonstration would go on ad infinitum. Scholars often refer\nto this point when discussing the skeptical modes of argument. The\nskeptics might be guilty of what, from Aristotle’s perspective,\nwould be a mistake of exactly this kind (on this theme in later\nAristotelian logic, cf. Malink forthcoming). \n\nAristotle continues in a way that is highly relevant to discussions\nof skeptical language and action. A person who wishes to deny that\nthings cannot be and not be at the same time has two options. Either\nthey say nothing, or they talk to us. In the first case, there is no\nneed for us to refute them. This person is like a plant—they do\nnot talk. In the second case, either their utterance signifies\nsomething, or it signifies nothing. If it signifies something, then\nthey say that something is so-and-so (which Aristotle takes to be\nself-defeating for them). If it signifies nothing, then it does not\nqualify as speech. Even though they make an utterance, the person is in\neffect not speaking with us (or to themselves). Aristotle also explains\nthe plant-metaphor in terms of action. A person who believes nothing is\nlike a plant because they cannot act. Pursuit and avoidance testify to\nthe fact that people have beliefs. (On Aristotle and skepticism, see\nthe papers collected in Irwin 1995.) \n\nWith Arcesilaus (316/5–241/0 BCE) and his role as leader of the\nAcademy (266/268 BCE), Plato’s Academy turns\nskeptical. Arcesilaus does not refer to himself as a\nskeptic—this nomenclature is a later designation. However,\nArcesilaus stands at the beginning of a re-orientation in the history\nof Platonically inspired philosophy. He rediscovers Socrates the\nexaminer. Socrates’ commitment to investigation, to the testing\nand exploring of one’s own and others’ beliefs, and his\npassion for weeding out falsehoods, are the starting-points of his\nAcademic skepticism (Cicero, Acad. 2.74, 1.46). Throughout\nthe history of this skeptical school, these traits, and the\ncorresponding commitment to a life guided by reason, remain alive\n(Cooper 2004b, Vogt 2013). When, as we shall see below, Arcesilaus\ndefends a skeptical life without belief, this is because, as he\nthinks, reason itself, if properly and faithfully followed, leads us\nto live that way. To Arcesilaus, the skeptical life is a life lived\nfollowing reason, a life based on reason—just as the\ncompeting Stoic and Epicurean lives are alleged by their proponents to\nbe. Arcesilaus engages with the epistemologies of these contemporaries\nof his. In particular, the Academics call into question that there is\na criterion of truth, as both Epicureans and Stoics, beginning in the\ngeneration before Arcesilaus, claim there is. \n\nLike Socrates, Arcesilaus did not write anything. His views must be\nunearthed from Sextus’ comparisons between Pyrrhonian and Academic\nskepticism, from Cicero’s discussions in the Academica, and\nfrom a range of shorter (and sometimes hostile) reports. Major themes\nin Arcesilaus’ philosophy are (i) his dialectical method, (ii)\ndiscussion of whether there is a criterion of truth, and (iii) his\ndefense of the skeptic’s ability to act. \n\n(i) Method. Arcesilaus embraces what scholars call a dialectical\nmethod (Couissin 1929 [1983], for a reading that calls the dialectical\ninterpretation in question, cf. Perin 2013). This method is inspired\nby Socrates. It proceeds by asking one’s real or imaginary\ninterlocutor what they think about a given question, then plunging\ninto an examination of their views, employing their premises. Can they\nexplain their position without running into inconsistencies, and\nwithout having to accept implications that they want to resist? As a\nconsequence of this method, it sometimes appears as if a skeptic,\nwhile examining someone’s view and its consequences, makes a\npositive claim: “so, such-and-such is not so-and-so.”\nHowever, within a dialectical exchange, this should be read as\n“according to your premises, such-and-such\nfollows.” This method remains a key ingredient of Greek\nskepticism. While the different skeptical schools develop variants of\nthe dialectical method, skeptical argument is often characterized by\nthe fact that skeptics think of themselves as engaging with\n“dogmatic” interlocutors. (In the skeptical tradition, as\narticulated for example by Sextus Empiricus (see section 4.4.),\n“dogmatists” are philosophers who put forward, and defend,\npositive answers to philosophical questions about reality, knowledge,\nethical values, etc. They need not do so dogmatically or rigidly or\nwithout consideration of alternatives in order to count, in skeptical\nterms, as “dogmatists.”) \n\n(ii) The Criterion of Truth. Zeno, the founder of Stoicism, and\nroughly 20–30 years Arcesilaus’ senior, was for a time a student at the\nAcademy. He was still in the Academy when he formulated key Stoic\ndoctrines. Like Arcesilaus, he claims Socratic ancestry. Zeno is\ninspired by some of the same ideas that inspire the skeptics. In\nparticular, he engages with the Socratic idea that knowledge is\nintegral to virtue. Contrary to Arcesilaus, Zeno aims to give accounts\nof knowledge and virtue, and holds them up as ideals that human nature\npermits us to achieve. For him, knowledge is very difficult to attain,\nbut ultimately within the reach of human beings. From the point of view\nof Arcesilaus, Zeno’s claim to Socratic heritage is almost offensive:\nZeno seems to be too optimistic about our cognitive powers to be\nfollowing Socrates (Frede 1983). Scholars have traditionally envisaged\nan exchange of arguments between Zeno and Arcesilaus, where each\nmodified his views in the light of the other’s criticism. However, Zeno\nmost likely formulated his views between 300–275, and Arcesilaus argued\nagainst him c. 275 to 240, when Zeno (who died c. 263) was probably\nalready retired (Brittain 2006, xiii; Alesse 2000, 115 f.; Long 2006,\nch. 5). \n\nThe core of the dispute between Arcesilaus and the early Stoics\nconcerns the question of whether there is a criterion of truth. The\nnotion of a criterion is introduced into Hellenistic discussions by\nEpicurus, who speaks about the kanôn (literally\nmeasuring stick) and kritêrion. For Epicurus, a\ncriterion is that evident thing, viz., the content of a\nsense-perception, against which claims about the non-evident are\ntested. For example, physics advances claims about non-evident things,\nsuch as atoms and void. These are not accessible to the senses, and\naccordingly, do not count as evident. Perception rules out various\nphysical theories. For example, a physical or metaphysical theory\naccording to which there is no movement can be dismissed because it is\nin disagreement with the evident. \n\nZeno argues that a certain kind of impression—namely a\ncognitive impression (phantasia\nkatalêptikê)—is the criterion of truth\n(cf. Shogry forthcoming-b).  Zeno’s conception of cognition\n(katalêpsis, literally grasping, apprehension), which\nfigures in the notion of a cognitive impression, tries to resolve a\nbasic epistemological problem.  Belief-formation aims at the truth;\nthere is a norm inherent in the practice of believing that one should\nonly believe truths. It is not transparent to us, however, which of\nour beliefs, or claims to the effect that such-and-such is true, aim\nsuccessfully at the truth. Zeno argues that some impressions are\ncognitive. That is, on his account, they are stamped and reproduced\nfrom something that is, exactly as it is; so they grasp it as it\nreally is. Hence, being so stamped and reproductive, they reveal\nthrough themselves that they are cognitive. For example, when I look\nat my computer screen while typing this, I may very well have a\ncognitive impression that this is my computer screen. When I look up\nand out of the window, I have an impression of a friend walking across\ncampus that is probably non-cognitive. This impression might be\ntrue. But since I see her from such a distance, it is pretty surely\nnot cognitive. That is, not all true impressions are cognitive, but\nall cognitive impressions are true. We should only assent to cognitive\nimpressions, and so in forming our beliefs, hold only those certified\nbeliefs (cf. Brittain 2014 on the Stoic view that assent to cognitive\nimpressions is not compelled).  All other beliefs—based on\nassents to non-cognitive impressions—violate the norm for\nbelieving that you should only believe truths, even if what you do\nbelieve may be true. \n\nArcesilaus calls into question whether there are impressions of this\nkind. His main point seems to be that there could be an impression\nthat is phenomenologically indistinguishable from cognitive\nimpressions, but nevertheless misrepresents the matters it gives an\nimpression about. To use an example that may derive from Carneades\n(see section 3.2), there is no impression of a given egg such that no\nimpression of any other egg could be phenomenologically\nindistinguishable from it. In response to this, the Stoics defiantly\nadded a clause to their definition, given above, of the cognitive\nimpression: “and of such a kind as\ncould not arise from what is not” (Long and Sedley\n(1987) [= LS] 40; DL 7.46, 54; Cicero Acad. 1.40–1, 2.77–8; SE\nM 7.247–52). Absent a criterion of truth, Arcesilaus’ skeptic\nsuspends judgment about everything (PH 1.232). Reason itself,\nArcesilaus thinks, demands such suspension. \n\n(iii) Action. If skeptics suspend judgment, argues their dogmatic\nopponent, they are not able to act. Stoic philosophy conceives of three\nmovements of the mind: impression, assent, and impulse (Plutarch,\nCol. 1122a-d). All three figure in action. The agent assents\nto the impression that A is to be done; their assent is an\nimpulse for the action A; if there is no external impediment, the\nimpulse sets off the action (Inwood 1985). It is a cornerstone of\nStoic philosophy that there can be no action without assent, and so\nwithout the belief that the action done is to be done. The\nStoics aim to avoid the kind of determinism according to which actions\nare not ‘up to’ the agent (Bobzien 1998); for them,\nimpressions, but not assents, are caused by external things. In\nresponse to the Apraxia Charge, Arcesilaus seems to have argued that\nthe skeptic can act without having assented (Plutarch, Col.\n1122A-d), and so without believing that the action done is to\nbe done. However, this is not his complete response. From the\npoint of view of the Stoics, skeptical action, if performed without\nthe relevant kind of assent (that is, assent that it is up to the\nagent to give, and that is a rational acceptance of the impression),\nis like the action of a non-rational animal, or like the automatic\nmovement of plants when they grow and flourish. Arcesilaus is robbing\npeople of their minds (Cicero\nAcad. 2.37–9; Obdrzalek 2013). But Arcesilaus need not\nand does not go so far as to compare human agents with non-rational\nagents. As human beings, skeptics have rational impressions. They\nperceive the world conceptually, and think about it. Arcesilaus does\nnot suggest that skeptical action is causally set off by impressions,\nor in the way, whatever that is, that animal actions are set off. This\nwould be a problematic proposal, for it would disregard that the\nskeptic has a human mind. Given the complexity of human thought, the\nskeptic is likely to have several, and often competing impressions. If\nall impressions triggered impulses, the skeptic would be inactive due\nto a kind of paralysis. The second component of Arcesilaus’\nreply, thus, is that the skeptic, in acting without assenting, adheres\nto the reasonable (eulogon) (SE M 7.158; 7.150;\nStriker 2010). That is, Arcesilaus aims to explain skeptic\naction as rational agency (Cooper 2004b). Arcesilaus disputes the\ndogmatic claim that some impressions can be identified as true, and\nthe related claim that one can only act on the belief that\nsome impression is true. But he does not argue that there are no\ndifferences between impressions which agents could take into\naccount. His agents are rational: they think about their options, and go\nwith what looks, in one way or another, more plausible. \n\nArcesilaus defends skeptical action also against Epicurean critics\n(Plutarch, Col. 1122A-d), again by showing on the basis of the\nEpicureans’ own premises that skeptical action is possible. Can the\nsceptic explain why, when leaving a room, they go through the door\nrather than running into the wall? Arcesilaus seems to have exploited\nthe Epicurean view that, while all sense-perception is true, belief can\nintroduce falsehood. Like the Epicurean, the skeptic can keep apart the\nperception and a view formed on its basis. By not assenting to the\nperception, thus adding belief (“here is the door”), the\nskeptic guards against the source of falsehood, namely belief. But a\nskeptic has perception of the door available to them, which is enough\nfor not running into walls. \n\nLike Arcesilaus, Carneades (214–129/8 BCE) refrains from writing\nand philosophizes in a Socratic spirit. Famously, on an embassy from\nAthens to Rome in 156/5 BCE, Carneades argues for justice one day, and\nagainst justice the next. His aim is not to overthrow\njustice. Carneades wants to show that the supporters of\njustice—including Plato and Aristotle—do not have the\nsuccessful arguments they think they have to show what justice is and\nwhat it requires (Lactantius,\nEpitome 55.8, LS 68M). Like Arcesilaus, Carneades (i) engages with Stoic\nepistemology. His account of skeptical action includes (ii) a detailed\nproposal regarding the criterion. As part of his less radical\nskepticism, Carneades seems (iii) to allow for a certain kind of\nassent, and perhaps for belief. \n\n(i) The Stoic-Academic Debate. Chrysippus, the third major Stoic\n(after Zeno and Cleanthes), and his student Diogenes of Babylon, revise\nZeno’s epistemology, defending it against Arcesilaus’ arguments\n(Brittain 2006, xiii). In response to their arguments, Carneades\ncontinues the exchange with the Stoics that Arcesilaus began (SE\nM 7.402–10). His first move addresses the link between mental\nstates and action. People in states of madness, he argues, act just as\neasily and naturally on their impressions as other people, even those\nwho act on cognitive impressions (if there are any). From the point of\nview of exhibited behavior, there does not seem to be a difference: any\nand all impressions, even those the Stoics think clearly arise from\nsomething that is not, are in all respects relevant to action\ncompletely on a par. Cognitive impressions, if there are any, have no\nsuperiority. \n\nIn a second argument, Carneades points to objects that are similar\nto one another: can the wise person discern any two eggs, two grains of\nsand, and so on? The Stoics have multiple replies. It is conceivable\nthat, in some contexts of action, the wise person assents to what is\nreasonable (eulogon) (DL 1.177), without having a cognitive\nimpression of how things are. Or, if faced with the task to identify\ngrains of sand while lacking a cognitive impression, the wise person\ncan suspend judgment. However, the wise will train themselves so as to\nbe able to perceive minute differences (Cicero, Acad. 2.57),\nwhere it might be important to do so. This point is backed up by Stoic\nphysics: no two items in the universe are identical, and their\ndifferences are in principle perceptible. Carneades replies that even\nif no two things were exactly alike (consistent with his general line\nof argument, he does not take a stance on such questions), a very close\nsimilarity could appear to exist for all perceivers (Cicero,\nAcad. 2.83–5); that is, the impressions of two items,\nthough in fact these items might differ from each other, could be\nindistinguishable (Shogry forthcoming-a and forthcoming-b). Discussion\ncontinues with a move on the part of the Stoics: they add to their\ndefinition of the cognitive impression “one that has no\nimpediment.” Sometimes an impression is—as it were, by\nitself—cognitive, but is unconvincing due to external\ncircumstances (SE M 7.253). It is a difficult question\nwhether this addition harms the Stoics more than it helps them. If the\ninitial conception of a cognitive impression hangs on the idea that\nsomething about its phenomenological nature, or something internal to\nthe impression, marks it as cognitive, the Stoics give up on a crucial\nassumption if they grant that sometimes there are\n“impediments.” If, however, cognitive impressions are\ndifferentiated by a causal feature (the way they are caused by the\n‘imprinter’ which causes the ‘imprint’), the\nfurther addition might help (Frede 1983, Nawar 2014), since the\nimpediment might need to be removed before the causal connection could\nbe confirmed (on the Stoic-Academic exchange, cf. Hankinson 2003). \n\n(ii) Carneades’ Criterion. Even though Carneades further pursues a\ndiscussion begun by Arcesilaus, he does not simply continue within the\nframework of Arcesilaus’ skepticism. The distinctiveness of his\nposition is best seen in the context of his criterion: the persuasive\n(pithanon). The notion of the persuasive can be understood in\ntwo distinctively different ways. Persuasiveness might be a causal\nfeature, so that a persuasive impression sets off a physiological\nprocess of being moved in a certain way. But there may also be a\nrational kind of persuasiveness. Carneades construes persuasiveness in\nrational terms. For him, the persuasive is the convincing, or perhaps\neven the plausible. \n\nCarneades develops a three-stage criterion: (1) In matters of\nimportance, skeptics adhere to the persuasive. (2) In matters of\ngreater importance, they adhere to the persuasive and undiverted. A\npersuasive impression is undiverted if there is no tension between it\nand its surrounding impressions. (3) In matters that contribute to\nhappiness, skeptics adhere to persuasive, undiverted, and thoroughly\nexplored impressions. A persuasive impression is undiverted and\nthoroughly explored when it and the surrounding impressions are closely\nexamined without its persuasiveness being diminished (SE M\n7.166–84). Consider an example. A skeptic looks in a dark room for a\nrope. Before they pick up what appears to them to be a rope, they look\nclosely and poke it with a stick. Coiled objects can be ropes, but they\ncan also be snakes. The persuasive impression that this is a rope must\nbe examined before the skeptic adheres to it (M 7.187). \n\nThe three-stage criterion is put forward in the context of action.\nHowever, Sextus describes Carneades’ criterion as a criterion of truth,\nnot a criterion of action (M 7.173). Carneades might take\nhimself to offer more than a practical criterion. His discussions of\nthe persuasive come close to a general epistemological theory (Couissin\n1929 [1983], Striker 1980, Bett 1989 and 1990, Allen 1994 and 2004\n[2006], Brittain 2001). Cicero renders the Greek pithanon as\nprobabile (and sometimes as veri simile), which\nmodern editors sometimes translate in terms of what is probable or\nlikely to be true. Some scholars think that Carneades is an early\nthinker about likelihoods, and argue that he develops a fallibilist\nepistemology (Obdrzalek 2004). \n\n(iii) Assent and Belief. Does adherence to persuasive impressions\ninvolve belief? Carneades coins a term for the kind of adherence he\nhas been describing: approval (Cicero, Acad. 2.99). He\ndistinguishes it from assent in the sense of Stoic and other dogmatic\ntheories, which establishes a belief that something is in actual fact\ntrue; but he nevertheless describes it as a kind of assent (Cicero,\nAcad. 2.104). Carneades’ disciples disagree on whether\napproval is any kind of genuine assent. That is, they disagree on\nwhether, in approval, one forms a belief. Philo and Metrodorus think\nthat Carneades allows for some kind of belief, close to or identical\nwith belief as the Stoics understand it. Clitomachus disagrees, and\nCicero follows Clitomachus (Acad. 2.78, see also 2.59, 2.67).\nScholars continue to debate these issues, and the basic problem\nremains unchanged.  It is not clear whether there is a plausible\nnotion of belief according to which belief falls short of\n‘holding to be true’ (or according to which, though some\nkind of ‘holding true’ is involved, the relevant\naffirmation-as-true is weaker than in beliefs as Stoics and other\ndogmatist epistemologists conceive of them). In any event,\naffirmations as true, at least of the full and flat-out (“in\nactual fact”) sort the Stoics think of, are precisely what the\nskeptic does not make. \n\nAnother approach to Carneades’ stance toward belief is to ask\nwhether he might invoke Platonic considerations. Consider that\nSocrates, when asked in the Republic what he thinks the good\nis, refuses to reply because he thinks beliefs without knowledge are\nshameful (Rp.  506c). In response to this, his interlocutors\npoint out that there is a difference between putting forward\none’s beliefs as if one knew them to be true, and putting them\nforward with the proviso that they are merely beliefs (Vogt 2012a,\nch. 2). The shamefulness of mere belief might disappear through this\nproviso. A passage in Cicero’s Academica suggests that\nCarneades invokes this thought. According to Carneades, the wise\nperson can hold beliefs if they fully understand them to be beliefs\n(2.148).  Along similar lines, it has been suggested that Carneades\nmight conceive of a hypothetical mode of believing (Striker 1980\n[1996, 112]), perhaps engaging with a move in\nPlato’s Meno.  Investigation cannot get off the ground\nif we do not, in some sense, begin with our beliefs about the matter\nunder investigation. But how can we do so without endorsing our\nbeliefs, not knowing whether our views are true? Plato’s answer\nat this point is: by hypothesizing our beliefs. Today we would insist\nthat hypotheses are not beliefs.  However, it is conceivable that\nCarneades argued along these lines, and that the details of his\nvocabulary got lost or confused in doxography. \n\nCarneades was an enigma to his students and immediate successors.\nClitomachus (head of the Academy from 127 to 110 BCE) seems to have\nattempted the impossible: to adhere closely to Carneades’\nphilosophy, even though he never understood what Carneades truly meant\n(Levy 2010).  The cornerstone of his adherence lies in the view that\nCarneades argues for suspension of judgment and against beliefs\nunderstood as Stoics understand them. Philo of Larissa, another\nstudent of Carneades, interprets his teacher as allowing for tentative\nbeliefs in the skeptic’s life. With Philo, the skeptical era of\nPlato’s Academy comes to an end. Philo’s philosophy seems\nto divide into two phases. In Athens, and as head of the Academy, he\nstays relatively close to Carneades. Moving to Rome later in his\ncareer, he develops a markedly different position. He argues only\nnarrowly against the Stoic criterion and their conception of\ncognition. One can apprehend things and so come to know\nthem—one just cannot apprehend them in the way in which the\nStoics construe cognition (PH 1.235). The fact that there is\nno apprehension in the sense of the Stoics does not mean that there is\nno knowledge (Acad. 2.14). This move shifts the discussion in\nseveral important ways. First, Philo can be interpreted as a kind of\nexternalist: one can know something without knowing that one knows it.\nAbsent Stoic cognitive impressions, we are not able to identify which\ninstances of ‘holding-true’ qualify as knowledge; but we\nnevertheless have some knowledge (Hankinson 2010). Second, this\nproposal is a step toward modern skepticism, which is not concerned\nwith criteria of truth, but with knowledge. \n\nCicero’s skeptical philosophy in his own philosophical writings is\nagain distinctively different. In line with his notions of what is\nprobable (probabile) or likely to be true (veri\nsimile), Cicero often examines a range of philosophical positions,\naiming to find out which of them is most rationally defensible. He\nthinks it is better for us to adopt a view that is likely to be true,\nrather than remain unconvinced by either side (Thorsrud 2009, 84–101).\nCicero is of the greatest importance for the transition between ancient\nand early modern skepticism. As in other fields of philosophy, Cicero’s\ninfluence is partly the influence of the translator. In transposing\nphilosophical ideas into the language of a different culture, the ideas\nchange. Cicero sometimes speaks of doubting, dubitari (e.g.,\nAcad. 2.27, 106; however, he often sticks with the earlier\nlanguage of assent and suspension). But doubt has no place in Greek\nskepticism (see section 1). \n\nWhen comparing Pyrrhonian and Academic skepticism, two topics stand\nout: Pyrrhonism aims at tranquility; and it assigns pride of place to\nappearances. Anecdotes about Pyrrho’s life (365/60–275/70\nBC) convey how unaffected he was (DL 9.61–69). This kind of\nideal—a tranquil state of mind—is not part of Academic\nskepticism, but is essential to Pyrrhonism (Striker 2010; for a\ndifferent view, cf.  Machuca 2006; for a general account of early\nPyrrhonism, cf. Castagnoli 2013; on Democritean influences on\ntranquility in Pyrrho and Timon, cf. Svavarsson 2013; on Sextus’\ntake on Pyrrhonian tranquility, cf. Svavarsson 2015). Insofar as the\npoint of the anecdotes about Pyrrho’s life is that Pyrrho did\nnot avoid or pursue anything with fervor, or that he did not despair\nabout things that other people find terrible, they capture ideas that\nremain central to Pyrrhonism. In other respects, the anecdotes may not\nbe trustworthy. They portray Pyrrho as a strikingly unconventional\nfigure, unaffected not just by emotion and belief, but also by\nperception—to the extent that friends had to pull him off the\nstreet when a wagon approached (DL 9.62). Another anecdote makes\nPyrrho appear not only unusual, but arguably a not so sympathetic\ncharacter. Passing by a drowning man, he was so unmoved that he simply\nwalked on (DL 9.63). This is in rather stark contrast with Stoic\nnotions of unaffectedness, where the idea would be that, not being\ndisturbed by emotions like fear and panic, the passerby is ideally\nequipped to help effectively. At the same time, Pyrrho seems to have\nsaid that the skeptic adheres to appearances (phainomena) (DL\n9.106; Bett 2000, 84–93; on earlier notions of appearances\nrelevant to skepticism, cf. Barney 1992). This might suggest that he\nwould not cross the street when a wagon is approaching, and so appears\nto him. The biographical details are also suspicious because they mold\nPyrrho’s life to fit the schema of the sage: a traveler to the\nEast (Flintoff 1980), whose insights are conveyed in brief sayings; an\nenigmatic figure, exemplary and shocking at the same time.  Even though he discussed tranquility and adherence to appearances,\nPyrrho was arguably no Pyrrhonian skeptic (Bett 2000,\n14–62). That is, it is likely that he put forward a dogmatic\nposition, in the sense that he had positive philosophical views about\nthe character of reality.  Pyrrho wrote nothing. Much of what we know\nabout him is preserved through the writings of Timon, his adherent\n(325/20–235/30 BCE) (on Timon, cf. Burnyeat 1980b and Clayman\n2009). The most important piece of testimony is a passage reporting an\naccount by Timon: \n\nIn response to the first question, how things are in their nature,\nPyrrho makes a metaphysical claim: they are indeterminate (Bett 2000,\n14–29). There are no stable items, or no items with stable properties.\nScholars sometimes hesitate to ascribe such a position to Pyrrho,\nbecause it is undoubtedly dogmatic. Perhaps the text can be given an\nepistemological reading: things are indifferentiable and unmeasurable\nand undecidable, because we fail in differentiating, measuring, and\ndetermining how they are (Thorsrud 2010, Svavarsson 2009). But Pyrrho’s\nresponse to the second question may only follow if we adopt the\nmetaphysical reading (Bett 2000, 29–37). Pyrrho infers that our\nperceptions and beliefs are neither true nor false. They are not\ntruth-evaluable, presumably because there are no facts which could be\ncorrectly captured. Third, if we understand these things,\nspeechlessness (aphasia) follows, and then tranquility\n(ataraxia). Pyrrho does not say that we should cease to speak.\nHe suggests that we adopt a complicated mode of speech, constructed\naround the expression ou mallon (“no more”), which\naims to capture the indeterminate natures of things, when we attempt to\nsay anything about anything (Bett 2000, 37–39). \n\nAenesidemus (first century BCE) was discontented with the views\ndiscussed in the Academy at his time, of which he began as an\nadherent.  Philo’s proto-externalism as well as a\ncounterposition formulated by Antiochus both appeared to him\ndogmatic. Aenesidemus aimed to revive a more radical skepticism, and\nleft the Academy for this purpose. Arguably, he is the first\nPyrrhonian skeptic. Aenesidemus wrote a treatise, the Pyrrhonian\nDiscourses, probably similar in structure to Sextus’\nOutlines of Pyrrhonism: a general account of skepticism,\nfollowed by books on particular philosophical questions (partially\npreserved in a summary by Photius; Hankinson 2010). The basic elements\nof Aenesidemus’ skepticism are: the skeptic puts appearances and\nthoughts into opposition; this generates equipollence\n(isostheneia, lit. “of equal weight”) between\nseveral appearances and/or thoughts; suspension of judgment follows;\nwith it comes tranquility; and the skeptic leads a life according to\nappearances (DL 9.62, 78, 106–7).  However, we do not know much\ndetail of his views on these matters.  Instead, Aenesidemus is famous\nfor having developed Ten Modes or Tropes—forms of argument by\nwhich the sceptic puts appearances and thoughts into opposition. Key\nquestions about Aenesidemus’ skepticism concern (i) the\ninterpretation of his Modes, (ii) the relationship of his philosophy\nto competing theories, (iii) the scope of the Ten Modes, and (iv) the\nskeptic’s mode of speech. \n\n(i) Conflicting Appearances or Causal Invariance. The Ten Modes are\npreserved in Diogenes Laertius (9.78–88), Philo of Alexandria\n(On Drunkenness 169–202), and Sextus. Diogenes’ account\nof the Ten Modes may postdate Sextus’s (Sedley 2015). Sextus\ngives extensive illustrations, and integrates the Ten Modes into his\ngeneral account of Pyrrhonism (PH 1.36–163;\ncf. M 7.345 for ascription of the Ten Modes to Aenesidemus;\ncf. Annas-Barnes 1985 and Hankinson 1995, 268; the sequence below\nfollows Sextus). Here is the first of the Ten Modes, interpreted in\ntwo ways. \n10-1: \n Arguments concerning oppositions based on the\ndifferences between kinds of animals. \n\nConflicting Appearances Interpretation:X appears F to animal of kind A (e.g.,\nhumans) and F* to animal of kind B [where F\nand F* are opposite or otherwise incompatible properties]. We\ncannot judge how X really is, because we are a party to the\ndispute. \n\nCausal Invariance Interpretation: For something\nto be ‘really’ F, it would have to consistently\naffect different perceivers as F. But different constitutions\nof different animals cause different impressions of the same\nthing. For different animals, something is F and F*\n(where F and F* are opposite or otherwise\nincompatible properties). Therefore, things do not seem to really\nbe F or F*. \n\nThe Conflicting Appearances Interpretation is based on Sextus’ account\n(Annas-Barnes 1985). The focus here is on the idea that every kind of\nanimal, perceiver, sensory faculty, thinker, or judger (depending on\nwhich mode we consider) is only one of several animals, perceivers,\nsensory faculties, thinkers, or judgers. The object is perceived or\nconsidered from a particular point of view. Everyone is a party to the\ndispute, and there is no ‘view from nowhere.’ Accordingly, the\ndispute cannot be decided. The Causal Invariance Interpretation, on\nthe other hand, suggests that the focus on decidability is introduced\nby Sextus. Aenesidemus may (implicitly or explicitly) have endorsed\nthe following idea: if X were F by\nnature, X would affect everyone as F. If X\naffects different people (living beings, sensory faculties, etc.)\nas F and F*, X is by nature\nneither F nor F*. For example, if X is\nharmful to A and beneficial to B, it is neither\nharmful nor beneficial in its nature (Woodruff 2010, Bett 2000). The\nTen Modes can generally be construed as engaging either with conflicts\nbetween appearances or with causal invariance: \n10-2:Arguments based on the differences among human\nbeings (differences in body and in soul). \n10-3: Arguments based on the differences between the\nsenses and on the complexity of perceived objects. \n10-4: Arguments based on states (dispositions and\nconditions of a human being, such as age, motion versus rest, emotions,\netc.). \n10-5: Arguments based on positions, distances, and\nplaces. \n10-6: Arguments based on mixtures (objects in\nconjunction with external things like air and humidity; physical\nconstituents of sense organs; physiology of thought). \n10-7: Arguments based on the composition of the\nperceived object. \n10-8: Arguments based on relativity (to the judging\nsubject, to circumstances, etc.). 10-8 comprises at least 10-1 to 10-7,\nor all Ten Modes. \n10-9: Arguments based on constancy or rarity of\noccurrence. \n10-10: Arguments concerned with ways of life,\ncustoms, laws, mythical beliefs, and dogmatic assumptions, all of which\ncan be put into opposition to each other. \n\n(ii) Skepticism, Relativism, Epicureanism. Consider first the\nrelationship between skepticism and relativism (cf. Bett 2000; Vogt\n2012a, ch. 4).  Relativism, as envisaged in Plato’s\nTheaetetus, looks at a similar range of phenomena. Things\nappear different to different kinds of animals; to different people;\nand so on. Relativism embraces the intuition that there is (as we\nwould say today) faultless disagreement.  That is, you and I disagree,\nbut neither of us is wrong. Accordingly, metaphysical relativism\nclaims we must give up the intuition that we both refer to the same\nthing. In the Theaetetus, the world dissolves into radical\nflux: there are no stable items with stable properties that we both\nrefer to. \n\nThe Ten Modes, according to Conflicting Appearances, differ from\nrelativism by turning precisely the other way (Annas-Barnes 1985, 97–8;\nPellegrin 1997, 552–3). They implicitly rely on the intuition that\nthere are stable items with stable properties. Of course, the skeptic\nis not committed to the thesis that opposites cannot hold of the same\nthing, and that therefore no two conflicting appearances can be true.\nHowever, the modes presuppose a common sense metaphysics that does not\naccommodate faultless disagreement. In all cases of disagreement, at best\none of us can be right. If we cannot figure out which view is right, we\nshould suspend. This does not mean that Pyrrhonians are committed to a\ncommon-sense metaphysics. The Ten Modes are only one of several tools\nthat skeptics have at their disposal. They may thus imply a metaphysics\nthat, at other points, skeptics would call into question (cf. Fine\n2003b, 352). \n\nCausal Invariance differs from Conflicting Appearances precisely with\nrespect to the metaphysics that is, even if only dialectically,\ninvoked. Aenesidemus seems to have explored the relationship between\nskepticism and flux. He remarks that skepticism leads to Heraclitean\nphilosophy. The idea that one thing appears to have contrary\nproperties (the ones it appears to different animals/persons/senses to\nhave) leads to the idea that one thing actually has contrary\nproperties (PH 1.210; cf. Schofield 2007 on the role of\nHeraclitus and causal invariance). This remark can be taken as an\nexpression both of moderate flux and of relativism (Aenesidemus does\nnot seem to think of radical flux, where it is no longer even possible\nto refer to anything). There is no stable reality of how things are\n(moderate flux); X is F and F* insofar as,\nif X seems F to A, this is true\nfor A, and F* to B, this is true\nfor B (relativism). This proposal differs from the Causal\nInvariance interpretation of the Modes presented above.  There,\nAenesidemus seems to argue that things do not really have stable\nproperties (they are neither F nor F* by nature); he\ndoes not say that they are F and F* (as relativism\nsays). \n\nA third approach, competing with skepticism and relativism, is\nEpicurean epistemology. Again, the set of phenomena to be accounted for\nis the same. But it is described differently. Epicurus insists that we\nshould not even speak of conflicting appearances. Rather, we should\nspeak of different perceptions. Perceptions cannot refute each other,\nbecause they are of the same weight (Epicurus here uses the term that\nis central to Pyrrhonism: equal weight, isostheneia)\n(DL.10.31–2). The fact that perceptions differ has perfectly reasonable\nexplanations: I look from a distance, you look from nearby; I have a\ncold, you are healthy; I am a human being, another cognizer is a dog; and so on.\nThese facts figure in the explanations of how our perceptions are\nconstituted. Accordingly, Epicurus argues, all perceptions, even though\nthey differ, are true. They all have a causal history that physics can\nexplain. The precise interpretation of this proposal is controversial.\nOne might object that the notion of truth employed here is deeply\npuzzling. It is not clear what it means to describe all perceptions as\ntrue if they cannot be true or false. \n\n(iii) Scope. For the greatest part, the Ten Modes seem to be\nconcerned with perception in a broad sense, so that it includes\npleasure and pain, harm and benefit, as well as pursuit and avoidance.\nTo perceive something as pleasant or beneficial is to pursue it.\nPerception and evaluation are also mixed in another way: depending on\nthe frequency with which we perceive something, it seems more or less\namazing and precious to us. 10-10 envisages\noppositions that can be construed with the help of dogmatic theses. The\nTen Modes thus fit Sextus’ description of what skepticism is: the\nability to put appearances and thoughts (phainomena and\nnooumena) into opposition (PH 1.8, 1.31–33; cf. DL\n9.78). \n\nAnother issue concerning the scope of the Ten Modes is whether they\naddress general or particular matters. Compare the example of whether\nthe tower is round or square (T) to the example of whether honey is\nsweet or bitter (H). (T) is a particular; the question is whether this\ntower is round or square. (H) can be construed as a particular\n(“is this bit of honey sweet?”), or as a general issue\n(“is honey sweet?”). The Ten Modes offer strategies for\nsuspension of judgment on both kinds of questions.  Scholars have asked whether it is a problem for skepticism if the\nTen Modes appear ‘systematic’ (Sedley 2015). A set\nof arguments that aims to be complete, covering domains according to a\nstandardized pattern, may appear to be out of tune with the\nskeptic’s presumed mode of investigation. Purportedly, skeptics\nthink through given questions as they arise, arriving at suspension of\njudgment in a piecemeal fashion. If this self-description is to be\ntaken at face value, then modes of generating suspension of judgment\nacross the board may appear problematic. In this respect, Diogenes\nLaertius’ report of the Ten Modes may be superior to\nSextus’ account. Diogenes begins with a remark that suggests\nthat skeptics pick up where other philosophers have already begun to\nmake an argument (9.78–9). Other philosophers have collected,\npresumably, ways in which ‘we are persuaded’, say, because\nthings regularly appear the same way. Now the skeptics, as it were in\nresponse to this, add a collection of further cases, where things do\nnot appear the same way to different cognizers. If this is the\ndialectical set-up, the Ten Modes may not be ‘systematic’\nin ways that harm skepticism. They may co-opt the patterns of dogmatic\nreports about cases where appearances are stable (Sedley\n2015). \n\n(iv) Language. Aenesidemus contributes an interesting move to the\nquestion of how the skeptic can speak. Consider the relationship\nbetween a skeptic’s state of mind and their utterances. One way to\nconstrue this relationship is that an utterance reflects a state of\nmind. This is a background assumption to the idea that, if skeptics use\nassertoric language, they hold beliefs. Another option is to assume\nthat language does not have the means to capture the skeptic’s state of\nmind. On this premise, a skeptic might flag their utterances as falling\nshort of doing so. This is Aenesidemus’ strategy. He says that the\nPyrrhonian determines nothing, and not even this fact that he\ndetermines nothing. The Pyrrhonian puts matters in such terms, he says,\nbecause he has no way to express the actual thought of the sceptic in\ndetermining nothing (Photius, Bibl. 169b40–170a14, =\n71C(6)-(8) LS). \n\nAlmost nothing is known about Agrippa (1st to\n2nd century CE; SE PH 1.164–177; DL 9.88–89).\nHowever, the modes of argument that Sextus calls the Five Modes are\nattributed to him. These modes are among the most famous arguments of\nancient skepticism (Barnes 1990, Hankinson 2010). \n5-1 Diaphônia: The mode that\nargues from disagreement. With respect to some matter that presents\nitself, there is undecided (anepikriton) conflict, both among\nthe views of ordinary life and the views held by philosophers. Due to\nthis, we are unable to choose or reject one thing, and must fall back\non suspension. \n5-2 Eis apeiron ekballonta:\nArguments that throw one into an infinite \nregress. That which is brought forward to make a\ngiven matter credible needs yet something else to make it\ncredible, and so on ad infinitum. Since we thus have no\nstarting point for our argument, suspension of judgment follows. \n5-3 Pros ti: Arguments\nfrom relativity. X only ever appears such-and-such\nin relation to the subject judging and to the things observed together\nwith it. Suspension on how X really is follows. \n5-4 Hypothesis: Someone makes an assumption\nwithout providing argument.  A dogmatist, if thrown back into an\ninfinite regress of arguments, just assumes something as a\nstarting-point, without providing an argument\n(anapodeiktôs). We suspend over mere\nhypotheses—they could be false, opposite hypotheses could be\nformulated, and so on. \n5-5 Ton diallêlon: Arguments that\ndisclose a circularity. This mode is used when that which\nought to confirm a given investigated matter requires confirmation\n(pistis—credibility) from that matter. We are unable to\nassume either in order to establish the other. We suspend judgment on\nboth. \n\nIt is a commonplace to say that, while the Ten Modes, as presented\nin Sextus, are concerned with conflicting appearances, the Five Modes\nare about argument or proof. In these modes, the skeptics develop\nstrategies by which to attack theories that the dogmatists defend. If\nthis is how we characterize the Modes, Aristotle’s objection (section\n2.3) immediately comes to mind. Do the Five Modes reveal the skeptic’s\nlack of understanding because they presuppose that everything is\nsubject to proof? (Barnes 1990; Hankinson 1995, 182–92; Long 2006, ch.3)\nThe three so-called formal modes—Regress, Hypothesis, and\nCircularity—can be construed in this fashion: when employing\nthem, the skeptic can argue that every premise must be supported by\nargument; if it is not so supported, the theory begins from a mere\nhypothesis (on earlier uses of the term hupothesis in Plato\nand in medicine, cf. Cooper 2002 [2004a]); or it is ultimately\ncircular. \n\nHowever, the skeptic might not be vulnerable to this objection.\nFirst, the Five Modes can be construed as dialectical, invoking\ndogmatic theories of justification (Striker 2004). Second, they might\nbe broader in scope. 5-1 and 5-3\nexplore disagreement and relativity. Skeptical examination often\nbegins with the Mode of Disagreement: different answers to a given\nquestion are surveyed, and the conflict between them is observed. The\ninterpretation of 5-1 hangs, for the most part, on\nthe question of whether anepikriton should be translated as\n‘undecided’ or ‘undecidable’ (Barnes 1990). It\nwould be dogmatic to claim that matters are undecidable. The\nPyrrhonist must prefer the idea that, up to now, matters have not been\ndecided. This leads to the question of whether something can be found\nthat would decide matters, and thus to the application of further\nmodes. Scholars have observed that 5-3, the Mode of\nRelativity, does not really fit into the Five Modes. However, the Five\nModes could be designed to supersede and include the Ten Modes,\nand 5-3 might be viewed as capturing the common\nthread of the Ten Modes. With the help of 5-3, the\nskeptic can argue that the premises that theorists employ are\nformulated from particular points of view, in particular contexts, and\nso on. \n\nThird, even the so-called formal modes (5-2,\n5-4, 5-5) might not be narrowly\nconcerned with proof, but rather with everything that can lend\ncredibility to something else. Consider Regress (5-2),\nthe first of the formal modes. The text does not actually speak of\nproof (apodeixis) (this is obscured by Bury’s Loeb\ntranslation; 5-4 is the only place in Sextus’ report\nof the Five Modes that uses a cognate of apodeixis). Sextus’\nlanguage is wider: the mode deals with everything that can make\nsomething else credible. We might read this in the context of the\nHellenistic view that proof is a species of sign (PH 2.122). A\nsign reveals something non-evident. Smoke that reveals fire has, from\nthis point of view, a function and structure that is similar to a\nproof. The target of the Five Modes might be sign-inferences in\ngeneral. If this is so, then their target might include what we would\ncall inductive reasoning and causal explanations (when Sextus\nintroduces a further set of modes, the Causal Modes, he says that they\nare not really needed, because the relevant work can be done by the\nFive Modes; PH 1.180–86). Taken together, the Five Modes deny\nall “proof, criterion, sign, cause, movement, learning, coming\ninto being, and that there is anything by nature good or bad.”\n(DL 9.90). This is notably more than just proof. Indeed, it is an\nexcellent summary of the key topics in Sextus’ discussions of logic,\nphysics, and ethics. \n\nSextus’ (ca. 160–210 CE) epithet, Empiricus, indicates\nthat he—at least at some point in his life—belonged to the\nempiricists, a medical school (on the relationship between medicine\nand skeptical therapeutic argument, cf. Voelke 1990; cf. Svavarson\n2014 for a brief conspectus of Sextus’ philosophy). The\nempiricist medical school argued against rationalistic tendencies in\nmedicine (Frede 1990; Allen 2010). Rationalism in medicine aims to\ngive causal explanations as a basis for therapies. Empiricism, on the\ncontrary, confines itself to observation and memory. Somewhat\nconfusingly (considering his name), Sextus discusses differences\nbetween Pyrrhonism and empiricism, and says that skepticism is closer\nto medical methodism than to empiricism (Allen 2010). Methodism\nfollows appearances, and derives from them what seems beneficial. No\nexplanations are attempted, no underlying substances postulated, and\nno regularities assumed—these are some of the rationalistic\nmethods that both methodism and empiricism argue against. Methodism\nalso makes no statements to the effect that such explanations cannot\nbe given, or that underlying substances and regularities do not exist,\nas Sextus says empiricism does (SE PH 1.236–241). \n\nSextus’ writings are traditionally divided into two groups. The\nOutlines of Pyrrhonism [PH] consists of three books.\nPH 1 is the only general account of Pyrrhonism that survives.\nPH 2 and 3 discuss questions of logic, physics, and ethics.\nThe other writings are summarily referred to, traditionally, as\nAgainst the Mathematicians [M]. In fact, they oppose\nnot just mathematical, but also other theorists: the title really\nmeans Against the Theoreticians, or Against the\nLearned (Bett 2012). In a sense, only M 1–6 should\ngo by that title. It is a complete work, and M 7 does not\nseem to be its continuation (Bett 2012,\n“Introduction”). M 1–6 discuss grammar, rhetoric,\ngeometry, arithmetic, astrology, and music theory. They argue\nagainst theoretical ‘learning’ in these fields. M\n7–11 discuss core questions of the three philosophical\ndisciplines, logic, physics, and ethics, and could plausibly be\nreferred to as Against the Logicians (M 7–8),\nAgainst the Physicists (M 9–10), and\nAgainst the Ethicists (M 11). Scholars disagree on\nwhether M is earlier (Bett 1997) or later than PH\n(Janacek 1948 and 1972). Scholars also disagree on whether we can\nevaluate different strands of skepticism within Sextus as more or less\nsophisticated. Those who consider PH as later often do so\nbecause they think it shows greater philosophical sophistication,\neither by avoiding claims that a certain matter cannot be known\n(sometimes described as negative dogmatism), as found in M\n1–6 and M 11, or by streamlining discussions from\nM 7–10 (Bett 1997; Brunschwig 1980). \n\nThese questions are complicated further by Sextus’ attempt to\nincorporate diverse material, such as different sets of Modes, into\nhis skepticism (for the view that the different sets of modes are part\nof an integrated philosophical approach, cf. Powers 2010). Arguably,\ntwo kinds of consistency are at work in Sextus’ writings. On the\none hand, Sextus aims at the consistency of one philosophical\noutlook. On the other hand, he aims at the consistency of having a\nresponse to every objection. These two aims overlap greatly, but they\ncan also come apart. A given argument might refute a particular\ncritic. This argument may go back to various earlier versions of\nPyrrhonism. Similarly, the critical objection that is refuted may be\ntraced to dogmatic theories formulated over the course of several\ncenturies. As a result, a given argument in Sextus may be effective\nagainst a given objection he has in mind. It may thus preserve\nconsistency in the sense of leaving the skeptic unharmed by dogmatic\ncriticism. But at the same time, this argument may have implications\nthat are in tension with the way in which Sextus explains skepticism\nin other passages. Such tensions are particularly important with\nrespect to the way in which Sextus uses core concepts. For example, it\nis not clear that Sextus uses the notion of appearances\n(phainomena) in a consistent fashion (PH\n1.8–9; 1.15; 1.22; for the view that Sextus employs the notion\nconsistently throughout, see Barney 1992). At times, he draws on the\ncontrast between appearances and thoughts (noumena). But for\nthe most part, the term refers to all cases where something seems\nso-and-so to the skeptic, either perceptually or in thought. In some\ncontexts, Sextus draws on the idea that appearances are impressions,\ninvoking the dogmatic assumption that impressions are passive. In\nother contexts, he does not envisage appearances as entirely passively\nexperienced (Vogt 2012b). \n\nIt is thus no surprise that the interpretation of Sextus’ Pyrrhonism\nis quite controversial. This applies in particular to the\nquestion of whether the skeptic has any beliefs, or beliefs of any\nkind. In the past 30 years, scholars have paid attention to this\nquestion more than to any other interpretive issue. Insofar as the\ntexts may contain different strands of Pyrrhonian argument, exegesis is\nto some extent shaped by the philosophical interests we bring to the\ntexts. Two ideas are particularly prominent here. First, some scholars\nfind in Sextus an account of action that challenges standard ancient\nand modern theories of agency. These theories might portray ordinary\nagents as all-too-rational, as if every action involved a belief that\nsuch-and-such is good. Scholars explore how far we can draw on Sextus,\nasking whether a life guided by appearances (as Sextus says the\nskeptic’s life is) might after all be rather ordinary (Frede 1979\n[1997]). Second, one might on the other hand embrace those aspects of\nSextus’ texts that make Pyrrhonism look radically different from\nordinary life. From this perspective, Sextus’ writings invite\nreflection on the question of whether it would be possible to live\nwithout belief (Burnyeat 1980 [1997]; Barnes 1982 [1997]; Burnyeat 1984\n[1997]). \n\nPH 1, which figures most prominently in scholarly\ndiscussions, is a tour de force. Sextus gives a general\naccount of what skepticism is, including skeptical investigation,\nsuspension of judgment, the skeptic’s end, action, and language; he\ngives lists and illustrations of various sets of Modes; he explains the\nso-called skeptical formulae (phônai), such as “I\ndetermine nothing,” “non-assertion,”\n“maybe,” and so on; and he compares skepticism to\nrelevantly similar philosophies. \n\nSextus emphasizes that the skeptic is an investigator. Others either\narrive at theories (dogmatism) or at claims about inapprehensibility\n(negative dogmatism—that the matter investigated is beyond one’s\ncapacity to decide, and so is unknowable). But the skeptic continues\nto investigate (PH 1.1–4). Investigation is described\nas setting appearances and thoughts into opposition (PH 1.8)\n(Morison 2011 offers a reconstruction of skepticism that takes its\nstarting–point from this description), and as the application of\nthe various sets of Modes (PH 1.36–186).  Skepticism\ndoes not have teachings, but it is a philosophy. Many of the thoughts\nthe skeptics arrive at are expressed in the skeptical formulae\n(PH 1.13–15; 187–209). The starting–point\n(archê) of skepticism is\ndivergency—anômalia. The proto-skeptics are\ndisturbed by the discrepancies they encounter, and begin to\ninvestigate (PH 1.12). They hope to gain quietude by settling what is\ntrue and what is false. But then they have a surprising\nexperience. Encountering disagreement where several views appear to be\nof equal weight (isostheneia), they find themselves unable to\ndecide things, give up, and experience tranquility (ataraxia)\n(Striker 1990 [1996]; Nussbaum 1994). The skeptic’s end\n(telos) is tranquility in matters of belief (kata\ndoxan) and moderate affection (metriopatheia) in matters\nthat are forced upon us (PH 1.25–29). That is, skeptics\ncan free themselves from those kinds of turmoil that come with holding\nbeliefs. They cannot free themselves from freezing, thirst, or pain.\nBut they suffer less than others, for they do not add the belief\n(prosdoxazein) that, for example, pain is bad. The skeptic\nmust explain how, without belief (adoxastôs), they can\nbe active. Sextus says that skeptics follow appearances, and that is,\nthat they adhere to the fourfold ways of life (PH\n1.21–24).  Nature supplies them with perception and thought;\nnecessary affections compel them (for example, thirst guides them to\ndrink); they go along with traditions and customs; and they can do\ntechnical things by having been instructed in skills. The notion of\nappearances is also central to Sextus’ account of how the skeptic can\nspeak. Without making assertions, a skeptic reports\n(apangellein) like a chronicler (historikôs)\nwhat appears to them now (PH 1.4). \n\nI shall discuss the following aspects of Sextus’ skepticism: (i)\ninvestigation, (ii) concepts and inference rules, (iii) belief, (iv)\nthe formulae, (v) appearances, (vi) language, (vii) action, and (viii)\nthe so-called special arguments (that is, arguments that do not\nexplain the nature of Pyrrhonism, but engage with specific dogmatic\ntheories in logic, physics, and ethics). \n\n(i) Investigation. Investigation must aim at discovery of the truth,\notherwise it is not genuine investigation. However, a skeptic seems to\nmechanically apply the skeptical Modes, in order to generate\nsuspension of judgment and tranquility. It seems as if the skeptics do\nnot genuinely aim at the truth (Palmer 2000; Striker 2001; Perin\n2006), though they claim to keep on investigating. Note that this\nobjection, unlike the other problems central to contemporary\nengagement with ancient skepticism, was not raised in antiquity. If\nancient skepticism is approached in the context of the larger study of\nancient philosophy, we might first of all note that the skeptics in a\nsense agree with Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and the\nStoics. All these philosophers defend, in so many formulations, a life\nof reason, of contemplation, of wisdom, or of inquiry as the best or\nat least a very good human life (on affinities between the\nskeptics’ commitment to inquiry and Aristotle, cf. Olfert\n2015). The objection that skeptical inquiry seems insincere, then, may\nnot have come up in antiquity in quite the way in which it is\ndiscussed today because a commitment to inquiry would be common ground\namong most philosophers. Further, we might observe that aiming at the\ntruth includes two aims: to accept truths, and to avoid\nfalsehoods. The Modes are tailored to keep us from assenting to\nsomething that could be false. Insofar as the skeptic’s effort\nto avoid falsehoods expresses a valuation for the truth, the skeptic\nmight be a genuine investigator (Vogt 2012a, ch. 5; Olfert\n2014). \n\nA related objection calls into question the actual practice of\nskeptical inquiry. Does Sextus rely on the assumption that, in any\ngiven case of putting several arguments into opposition, these\narguments are equally persuasive for the skeptic? This seems\nunrealistic: at least in some cases, skeptical inquirers are bound to\nbe more strongly attracted to one view than to another. How then do\nthey arrive at suspension of judgment? One skeptical strategy is to\nremind oneself that additional arguments will be formulated in the\nfuture (PH 1.33–34, 89, 96–97; 2.38–41; 3.233–34). Another\nstrategy is to consider that different arguments are persuasive to\ndifferent people (Svararsson 2014). Relatedly, skeptics may find\nthemselves in a position comparable to a student who takes a seminar\non freedom and determinism: it is possible to be more attracted to one\nview rather than another, and at the same time be aware that as far as\nthe arguments are concerned, there is unresolved disagreement among\nseveral views, to the effect that neither of the views seems\ncompelling in ways that warrant assent (cf. Vogt 2012a, ch. 5, on how\nthe skeptical expression “as far as the argument is\nconcerned” bears on this question; for general discussion of\nthis expression, cf. Brunschwig 1990). \n\n(ii) Concepts and rules of inference. If skeptics do not assent,\nthen how can they understand the terms philosophers use\n(M 8.337–332a)? Even more radically, how can they even think\n(PH 2.1–12)? This objection, which Sextus says is continually\nraised against the skeptics, proceeds on the assumption that possession\nof concepts involves the acceptance of assumptions. For example, in\norder to examine a given theory of proof, the skeptic must have a\nnotion of what proofs are. This involves assumptions: for example, the\nassumption that a proof contains premises and a conclusion. Sextus’\nresponse to this objection invokes the Epicurean and Stoic theories of\npreconceptions. Human beings are not born with reason (Frede 1994,\n1996). The acquisition of reason is a nature-guided process\nof concept acquisition. At a given age, children have completed this\nprocess. They have become rational, which means that they can\nperceive and think in a conceptual way. Only now, they have rational\nimpressions to which they can assent. The acquisition of preconceptions\ndid not involve assent, simply because the child was not yet rational\n(Brittain 2005). \n\nSextus invokes dogmatic ideas about the acquisition of reason (or: the\nabilities of conceptual thought) in his response to the Apraxia Charge\n(PH 1.23–4). Skeptics are, first of all, active because\nnature has equipped them with perception and thought (Vogt 1998,\n2010).  More generally, the skeptics’ ability to think and\ninvestigate depends on the fact that they have acquired concepts as\npart of growing up.  This process did not involve assent, and\naccordingly, Sextus argues that the skeptic’s ability to think\ndoes not violate suspension of judgment (cf. Brunschwig 1988; Vogt\n2012a ch. 6; Grgic 2008; Fine 2011). It is conceivable, though, that\nthe skeptic’s ability to understand involves some knowledge,\nnamely a kind of knowledge that does not entail any belief (Corti\n2009, part III; Corti 2015). This option appears counterintuitive\ngiven today’s premises in epistemology, according to which\nsomeone who knows that p also believes that p. The relevant notion of\nbelief in skeptical discussions, doxa, as well as the\nrelevant ancient notions of knowledge, however, may behave quite\ndifferently (cf. Vogt 2012a and Moss and Schwab forthcoming on belief;\nBurnyeat 1980c, Frede 2008 and Schwab 2016 on knowledge). Insofar as\ndoxa is an inherently deficient activity and attitude, and\ninsofar as knowledge is conceived in elevated ways, knowledge without\nbelief is a rather intuitive option within ancient epistemology. If\nunderstanding concepts and arguments involves knowledge that does not\nentail beliefs, the skeptics may be taken to have such\nknowledge. Modern critics raise the further question of whether the\nskeptic must endorse logical laws (such as the Principle of\nNon-Contradiction) and rules of inference. In particular, they ask\nwhether a skeptic is committed to the logical validity of the\nconditionals they formulate when arguing against the dogmatists\n(Sorensen 2004). Sextus records no ancient version of this complaint,\nand accordingly no direct response. \n\n(iii) Belief. Bury, in his Loeb translation, translates adoxastôs as\n“undogmatically,” for example, when Sextus speaks\n(PH 1.15) of skeptics as saying that “nothing is\ntrue.” This translation suggests that Sextus bans dogmatism from\nthe skeptic’s life, where this still leaves room for other,\nnon-dogmatic beliefs. But adoxastôs means\nnon-doxastically or ‘without belief’ (cf. Burnyeat 1980\n[1997]). As noted above, the skeptic’s end is tranquility in matters\nrelating to belief—kata doxan. A skeptic lives\nadoxastôs. And even more confusingly, the skeptics\nassent adoxastôs, when they act. \n\nContemporary interest in Pyrrhonian skepticism was much spurred by\nMichael Frede’s paper “The Sceptic’s Beliefs” (1979\n[1997]). Frede argues that ancient skepticism was traditionally\ndismissed too easily as vulnerable to the Apraxia Charge, the charge\nthat, without belief, the skeptic cannot act. The skeptics seem to be\nconfident that they have replies to this objection. Thus, it seems\nuncharitable not to look closely at these replies. Further, insofar as\nthese replies respond to the charge that without belief one cannot act,\nwe should focus on what the skeptics say about the role of belief in\ntheir lives. Frede cites PH 1.13, and claims that in this\npassage we find a distinction between two kinds of belief: \n\nFollowing Frede, several scholars focus on PH 1.13 when\ndiscussing skeptical belief (with the notable exceptions of Barnes 1980\n[1997] and Barney 1992). They take it to be obvious that, in this\nparagraph, Sextus distinguishes between two kinds of belief, one which\nhe bans from the skeptic’s life, and one which he allows into the\nskeptic’s life. Barnes (1982 [1997]) employs a distinction between\nrustic and urbane skepticism. The rustic skeptic suspends on all\nmatters. The urbane skeptic suspends on scientific matters, but holds\nordinary beliefs. The clause “non-evident matters investigated in\nthe sciences” in PH 1.13 might be taken as a point of\nreference for the urbane interpretation. However, Barnes points out\nthat this cannot be right. Everything can be considered as a\nnon-evident matter, even such things as whether honey is sweet. \n\nAgainst Barnes, Frede argues that the relevant distinction must be\ndrawn between two kinds of assent, such that “having a view\ninvolves one kind of assent, whereas taking a position, or making a\nclaim, involves another kind of assent, namely the kind of assent the\nsceptic will withhold” (1984 [1997], 128). Sextus characterizes\nskeptical assent in three ways. He speaks of forced assent (PH\n1.23–24), involuntary assent (PH 1.19), and adoxastôs\nassent (PH 2.102). Frede does not explore the details of how Sextus\nuses these notions. The core of his proposal is that Sextus allows for\na kind of assent that does not involve a claim as to how things are in\nactual fact.  In (1979 [1997]), Frede is predominantly concerned with the\nskeptic’s reply to the Apraxia Charge. In (1984 [1997]) his\nfocus is on skeptical pronouncements such as “nothing can be\nknown.” His distinction between two kinds of assent, and\naccordingly two kinds of belief, is explored with respect to such\nsentences. Frede writes that “[t]o be left with the impression\nor thought that p […] does not involve the further thought that\nit is true that p” (133). This is the sense in which, on his\ninterpretation, the skeptic might think “nothing is\nknown.” The thought counts as a belief, but not as a claim that,\nin actual fact, nothing is known by anybody. Contrary to Frede’s\ninterpretation, one might argue that to believe simply is to hold\ntrue, at least according to the notions of belief that the skeptics\ninvoke in discussions with their contemporary critics (Vogt 2012b). It\nis thus not clear that Frede’s distinction is genuinely one\nbetween two kinds of beliefs (Burnyeat 1980 [1997]). Perhaps it is a\ndistinction between two different propositional attitudes, only one of\nwhich is belief. As Striker (2001) points out, there is a danger that\ndebates over this issue become merely terminological. We might thus\ndraw a distinction between two issues. It is one thing to disagree\nwith Frede on what should or should not be called belief, and another\nto dispute whether he identifies and characterizes a phenomenon in the\nskeptic’s mental life. As Frede argues, skeptics find themselves\nwith a rather persistent thought, without having accepted it as true\nin actual fact. This appears to capture a core element of skepticism:\nthe way in which the skeptic thinks such thoughts as “everything\nis inapprehensible.” \n\n(iv) The Skeptical Formulae. PH 1.13, the passage in which\nscholars find a distinction between two kinds of belief, occurs in a\nchapter entitled “Does the Skeptic dogmatize?” One angle\nfrom which we might disagree with Frede is to insist that PH\n1.13 addresses the status of the core thoughts of skeptical philosophy,\nrather than the question of skeptical belief. Consider the rest of the\nchapter: \n\nWhen explaining in PH 1.13 how the skeptic does not\ndogmatize, Sextus may have a particular issue in mind: that some\nskeptical formulae look like doctrines, and have traditionally been\nturned against themselves due to their dogmatic surface-structure. For\nexample, “all things are indeterminate” looks like a\nstraightforward dogmatic statement. There is a long history of\nskeptical attempts to explain the nature of such pronouncements so\nthat they no longer undermine themselves. Sextus arguably mentions\nseveral solutions to this problem (PH 1.13–15 and\n1.187–209; cf.  Pellegrin 2010). In\nPH 1.15, Sextus identifies the following as his main point:\nthe skeptic merely reports what appears to them.  Along these lines,\nSextus calls indeterminacy an affection of thought (pathos\ndianoias; PH 1.198), a state that the utterance\n“all things are indeterminate” aims to capture.  The other\nsolution mentioned in PH 1.14–15 is somewhat more\nproblematic: the skeptical formulae cancel themselves out. That is,\none can say them and convey something through them. But then, once one\nhas made a point, they as it were turn back upon themselves and eat\nthemselves up—as fire first burns combustible materials and then\ndestroys itself. This idea became famous through another comparison\nSextus uses (invoked by Wittgenstein (1922) 6.54): the skeptical\npronouncements are like a ladder that one climbs up; once one is on\ntop, one can throw the ladder away (M 8.481). Scholars\ndisagree on whether Sextus in some sense admits that these statements\nare self-refuting (McPherran 1987), or whether he defuses their\nself-refutational structure (Castagnoli 2010, III.14). \n\n(v) Appearances (phainomena). While it is difficult to\nestablish a clear distinction between two kinds of belief in Sextus,\nthere is a comparatively more explicit distinction between two ways of\nengaging with appearances. Sextus says that, while things appear X to\nthe skeptic, the skeptic does not affirm that they are X. Questions\nthat are traditionally discussed in terms of whether the skeptic has\nbeliefs thus might be addressed in terms of whether the way things\nappear to the skeptic has a judgment-component. Arguably,\n“A appears X to me now” can be construed in different\nways. Certain examples (say, the way in which it makes sense to say\nboth that the moon appears small and that it appears large) may\nsuggest that appearance can but need not involve something like a\njudgment (Barney 1992). Some formulations in Sextus seem to insist on\na significant difference between the mental activity of something\nappearing to a cognizer on the one hand, and on the other hand the\nmental activity that, on the level of language, is represented by\nassertion. This suggests that, for Sextus, A appearing F to me now\ndoes not entail that I hold it to be true that A is F (Vogt\n2012b). \n\n(vi) Language. Another approach to the question of whether the skeptic\nhas beliefs looks at skeptical language. Sextus insists that the\nskeptic does not accept or reject any impression, and associates the\nabsence of these mental acts with the fact that the skeptic does not\naffirm or deny anything (e.g., PH 1.4, 7, 10). Arguably, we\ncan infer from Sextus’ account of the skeptic’s utterances what Sextus\nwants to say about the skeptic’s mental states and acts. That is, the\nquestion of language immediately bears on the question of belief. The\nreport on Pyrrhonian skepticism in Diogenes Laertius is particularly\ninstructive in this respect. Contrary to scholarly focus on belief in\nreconstructing skepticism, it barely mentions belief. Discussion of\nthe skeptics’ attitudes is almost entirely conducted in terms of\nskeptical language and the skeptical formulae (for detailed discussion\nof the relevant paragraphs, DL 9.74–7, cf. Corti\n2015). If Sextus is read in light of the report in DL\nIX, PH 1.13 may appear to be more of an isolated passage than\nscholarly debates imply. Sextus too devotes much space to accounts of\nskeptical expressions and language. It may thus be asked whether\nscholars should reframe discussions, and pay more attention to\nskeptical language then they previously have. As of now, there is one\nmonograph on skeptical language, Corti (2009), and one approach to\nbelief that focuses on language, Vogt (1998). Both scholars pursue\nfurther ideas put forward by Barnes (1982 [1997]), who compares the\nskeptic’s utterances to avowals. The skeptic lays open their state of\nmind, they announce or record (apangellein) it (Fine\n2003a). In order to do this, the skeptic must misuse language\n(Burnyeat 1984 [1997]). Some strategies to avoid assertion are given\nin the context of the skeptical formulae (“non-assertion,”\n“I determine nothing,” and so on). (i) Skeptical\nexpressions can be used as signs, which reveal a state of mind\n(PH 1.187). (ii) Expressions like “ou\nmallon” (no more) and “ouden mallon”\n(nowise more) can be used indifferently (in the sense of\ninterchangeably) (PH 1.188). (iii) As is the practice in\nordinary language, the skeptic can use expressions elliptically; for\nexample “no more” for “no more this-than-that”\n(PH 1.188). (iv) People often use questions instead of\nassertions and the other way around. Similarly, “no more”\ncan be construed as a question: “Why more this-than-that?”\n(v) The skeptic misuses language and uses it in a loose way\n(PH 1.191). \n\nIn M 1 and M 2, Sextus says that the skeptic goes\nalong with ordinary ways of using language (M 1.172, 193, 206, 218,\n229, 233; M 2.52–3, 58–9). This seems to be a key resource\nin construing skeptical ways of speaking: the skeptic exploits the\nways in which ordinary speakers can diverge from grammatically correct\nspeech, and still be understood. Apart from using their skeptical\nformulae, and apart from conducting philosophical investigations,\nwhich they can do in a dialectical mode, referring to theses,\narguments, and inferences, the skeptic also has to talk in everyday\ncontexts. It is here where we see best how skeptical utterances are\ntailored to reveal a state of mind in which nothing is accepted or\nrejected. Sextus takes great pains to construe his examples of\nskeptical utterances according to the following schema:\n“X appears F to me now.” This will\ngenerally be understood as an elliptical version of “X\nappears to be F to me now.” However, Sextus\nconsistently avoids “to be” (Vogt 1998; for the view that\n“X appears F” avoids reference to external\nobjects, see Everson 1991). The peculiar form of skeptical utterances\nsuggests that Sextus sees a relevant difference between\n“X appears to be F to me now” and\n“X appears F to me now.” The former\nmight imply reference to a state of affairs, and an epistemic usage of\n“to appear” that could be rendered as “It appears to\nme, that p,” or, “I take it that p.” This, however,\nwould be assertoric: the skeptic would state that it appears to them\nthat such-and-such is the case. But the skeptic’s elliptical\nutterances about what appears to them aim to be purely\nphenomenological. They aim to report a condition of the\nskeptic’s mind, without expressing a judgment of any kind\n(Burnyeat 1984 [1997]; Annas-Barnes 1985, 23–4; for an\nassessment of these strategies in terms of modern philosophy of\nlanguage, cf. Pagin forthcoming). As part of the skeptics’ way\nof life, language can also be seen as an activity. That is, how the\nskeptics can speak can be considered a sub–question of how the\nskeptics can act. Skeptical utterances have been compared to\nWittgensteinian confessions, arguably a kind of speech act that is\nconsistent with the skeptics’ avoidance of belief (Corti 2009,\nParts I and II). Moreover, the skeptics not only speak. They\npresumably also understand what others say. A persuasive account of\nskeptical language must explain both speaking and understanding (Corti\n2009, Part III). \n\n(vii) Action. Sextus says that appearances (phainomena) are\nthe practical criterion of the skeptic (PH 1.23–24). By\nadhering to appearances, the skeptic is prevented from inactivity\n(anenergêsia). Note that Sextus does not describe the\nskeptic as performing actions in the sense of dogmatic theory of\naction, which involves belief and choice (cf. M 11.162–166).\nContrary to the Academic skeptic, a Sextan skeptic does not view themselves\nas a rational agent, who chooses one course of action over another.\nSextus claims an active life for the skeptic, but not the life of a\nrational agent, as conceived by dogmatic philosophers (Vogt 2010). \n\nThe skeptic’s forced assent is situated in the domain of action\n(PH 1.13, 19, 29–30, 193, 237–8). Thirst, for example,\nnecessitates assent, and that means, it moves the skeptic to drink.\nThis kind of assent may be genuinely unrelated to belief-formation of\nany kind. Rather, forced assent generates the movement of action. But\nwhat about more complex kinds of activities, such as applying a\nmedication, or attending a festival? Sextus argues that the skeptic\nadheres to custom, convention, and tradition, and to what they have\nbeen trained to do. In explaining how adherence to appearances in these\ndomains generates activity, Sextus does not mention assent. However, he\nmight have to concede that, like drinking when thirsty, more complex\nactions also involve some kind of assent. In PH 2.102, Sextus\nsays that the sceptic assents non-doxastically\n(adoxastôs) to the things relied on in ordinary life. In\nPH 1.19, he mentions involuntary assent. Accordingly,\nnon-doxastic and involuntary assent may figure in those domains of\nskeptical action that do not involve necessitation by bodily\naffections. Non-doxastic assent is, from the point of view of the\nStoics, a contradiction in terms, just like forced and involuntary\nassent. Assent is defined as in our power, and as that by which beliefs\nare formed. If Sextus intends skeptical assent to be genuinely\nnon-doxastic and involuntary, then it does not have the core features\nof assent as defined by the dogmatists.  (viii) Logic, Physics, Ethics, and the “disciplines.”\nThe special arguments of the skeptic are directed against particular\ntheories in the three disciplines of Hellenistic philosophy: logic,\nphysics, and ethics. In addition, they address the so-called\ndisciplines, namely grammar, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic,\nastrology, and music-theory.  Sextus’ treatments of logic divide\nup into two main topics: sign and criterion (cf. Bett 2005 on\nsigns). This structure reflects central concerns of Hellenistic\nepistemology as well as of ancient skepticism. Skepticism looks for a\n‘decider’ between conflicting appearances and thoughts. A\ndecider could be something evident. Dogmatic philosophers associate\nthe evident with the criterion of truth. For something to serve the\nrole of criterion, it cannot be equally disputed as the matters it\nhelps to decide. Or something non-evident could take on the role of\ndecider. For that to be the case, the skeptics argue, it would have to\nbe conclusively revealed by a sign or proof. If there is no compelling\ntheory of the criterion and no compelling account of sign and proof,\nthen there is nothing that can decide between several conflicting\nviews. Sextus’ treatises on logic thus are not simply a\ncollection of individual arguments against various dogmatic\ntheories. Their main line of thought sketches a route into\nskepticism.  Sextus’ discussions of ethics also focus on issues that\nplausibly lead into skepticism. Again, there are two central\nquestions: whether there is anything good and bad by nature; and\nwhether there is an art of life (Bett 2010 and 2011), as the\nEpicureans and Stoics claim there is. If we could settle what is good\nand what is bad, some of the most disturbing anomalies would be\nresolved. If there were an art of life, there would be a teachable\nbody of knowledge about the good and the bad. In both cases, questions\nthat can cause a great deal of puzzlement would be\nresolved. Sextus’ discussions of ethics are in part famous\nbecause Sextus ascribes outlandish and shocking views to the\nStoics. As Sextus construes his arguments, the contrast between\n‘ordinary life’ and philosophical views leads to\nsuspension of judgment (Vogt 2008a, ch.  1). In the modern tradition,\na number of philosophers including Hegel and Nietzsche have engaged\nwith aspects of Sextus’ outlook and in particular with the\nskeptical adherence to ordinary life (Berry 2010 and forthcoming; Bett\nforthcoming). \n\nThe books on physics discuss god, cause, matter, bodies, mixture,\nmotion, increase and decrease, subtraction and addition, whole and\npart, change, becoming and perishing, rest, place, time, and\nnumber. Notably, god is one of the topics explored in physics. This\nstands in stark contrast to medieval and early modern discussions,\nwhere the quest for knowledge of God often frames and motivates\nengagement with skepticism (cf. Annas 2011 on the difference between\nancient and monotheistic conceptions of divinity and their\nrepercussions for skepticism). The skeptics come to suspend judgment\non all central conceptions of ancient physics (Bett 2012). This means,\nthey come to suspend judgment on whether, for example, there are\ncauses, time, place, and bodies (cf. Bobzien 2015 and Warren\n2015). Their suspension does not merely mean that they have not yet\nfound a satisfying theory of, say, body. It means that they find\nthemselves unable to say whether there is body (Burnyeat 1997). (On\nthe cumulative force of these arguments, see section 5.4.) \n\nThe six books entitled Against those in the Disciplines\n(M 1–6) have traditionally received less attention. Only in\nthe last few years have scholars begun to explore them with the kind\nof philosophical subtlety that has been brought to bear in the study\nof ancient skepticism in recent decades. M 1–6 skeptically\nexamine six fields of study, namely grammar, rhetoric, geometry,\narithmetic, astronomy, and music-theory. Sextus begins with an\nastonishing move. Contrary to his usual strategy of emphasizing the\ndistance between skeptics and dogmatists, he admits that Pyrrhonians\nand Epicureans share much in viewing standard disciplines as useless\n(M 1.1–7). Generally speaking, increased attention\nto M 1–6 may provide additional occasion to modify the\nlong-standing assumption that the Stoics are Sextus’ most\nimportant dogmatic interlocutors. Throughout M 1–6,\nresonances between Epicurean and Pyrrhonian philosophy are remarkably\nvisible (Bett 2018, “Introduction”). Engagement with\nEpicurean philosophy shapes Sextus’ approach deeply, to the\nextent that both schools, Stoics and Epicureans, should be considered\nfundamental points of reference. \n\nAfter his remarks on how Pyrrhonians and Epicureans take issue with\nthe presumed usefulness of the disciplines, Sextus lays out general\narguments, suitable for skeptical examination of any field. He argues\nthat, for there to be a discipline, there must be the matter being\ntaught, the teacher, the learner, and the means of learning. If,\nhowever, neither of these things exists, then the discipline\ndoesn’t exist. This is how Sextus proceeds. He argues, or seems\nto argue, for the non-existence of the disciplines (M\n1.9). Already in the very first sentence of M 1, Sextus\ndescribes his own approach as one of putting forward counterarguments,\na strategy that he mentions repeatedly throughout M 1–6. \n\nThese moves give rise to the most contentious question\nregarding M 1–6. Are these books negatively dogmatic? Or do\nthey fit in with Sextus’s outlook in PH 1–3, where skeptical\narguments are described as leading up to suspension of judgment? Bett\n(2018, “Introduction”) argues that, with some\nqualifications, Sextus’ approach is to be explained as\nfollows. Sextus lays out counterarguments based on the assumption that\nthe arguments of the dogmatists have already been formulated. For\nthere to be arguments of equal weight on both sides, only the\nanti-dogmatic arguments need to be adduced. The intended effect is\nthat jointly, these opposing sets of arguments lead us to suspend\njudgment. In addition, Bett notes that the remarkable emphasis on\ncounterarguments, non-existence, and uselessness suggests that some of\nthe material in M 1–6 goes back to an earlier phase of\nPyrrhonism. \n\nIn four of the six fields, namely grammar, rhetoric, music, and\nastrology, Sextus admits non-technical versions into the\nskeptic’s life, while subjecting all theoretical claims to\nskeptical examination. For example, he distinguishes between the\nordinary ability to read and write on the one hand and grammar as a\ntechnical discipline on the other, or the ability to play a musical\ninstrument on the one hand and music theory on the other (cf. Corti\n2015b on why this kind of contrast does not come up in the books on\narithmetic and geometry, and Corti 2015c on Sextus’ attack on\nthe Platonic-Pythagorean notion of the Two). \n\nIt is remarkable that, qua theoretical field, Sextus examines\nastrology rather than astronomy. The latter would make for a more\ntypical sequence: apart from the fact that in Sextus, logic is\nconsidered part of philosophy rather than a “discipline,”\nthe six fields otherwise correspond to the so-called trivium of\ngrammar, logic, and rhetoric and quadrivium of arithmetic, geometry,\nastronomy, and music theory. Sextus’ attention to astrology\nrather than astronomy highlights a deep feature of his philosophy\n(Corti 2015, Bett 2018). Astronomy, from Sextus’ point of view,\nis concerned with appearances; and hence there is a sense in which the\nskeptic does not object to it. Astronomy, then, is the\n“version” of astrology that skeptics can admit into their\nadherence to ordinary life (M 5.1–3). Presumably, astronomy\nis concerned with predicting things like droughts, floods,\nearthquakes, and plagues based on appearances. Astrology, on the other\nhand, is concerned with matters of great obscurity. \n\nHistorians of philosophy sometimes argue that Henri Etienne’s\nrediscovery of Sextus in 1562 initiated an era of epistemology. Early\nmodern engagement with skepticism is here seen as a turn to arguments\nfound in Sextus (Annas-Barnes 1985, 5–7; Bailey 2002,\n1–20). In particular the beginning of\nDescartes’ Meditations may display a kind of Socratic\nspirit: a commitment to calling into question all one’s\nbeliefs. However, early modern philosophers work within a\ntheologically framed tradition that importantly begins with St.\nAugustine (354–430) (cf. Menn 1998 and Lagerlund 2009; on the history\nof medieval skepticism cf. Lagerlund ed. 2009; cf. Carriero 2009 on\nDescartes’ engagement with Aquinas; for an analysis of the\ntransformation of skepticism that turns immediately to Descartes,\ncf. Williams 2010). \n\nA major part of Augustine’s early education consisted in the study of\nCicero’s writings. He was thus closely acquainted with Academic\nskepticism (Cicero was one kind of Academic skeptic). Augustine sees\nthe force of ancient skeptical strategies. Even though he does not\nbecome a skeptic, he integrates distinctively skeptical moves into his\nthought. This has a long-standing effect on the history of theology and\nscience. For example, Galileo Galilei is able to cite Augustine when he\ndefends himself against the charge that his physics is in opposition to\nthe Bible (Letter to the Grand Duchess, in Drake 1957).\nAugustine supplies arguments to the effect that we should keep an open\nmind. Both our physical theories and our interpretations of the Bible\nare likely to evolve. This idea figures importantly in Pyrrhonism. Past\nexperience tells us that, on every given issue, someone eventually came\nup with a new argument. Accordingly, even if the skeptics cannot find an\nobjection to a given claim right now, they expect that in the future, a\nconflicting view will be formulated. \n\nHowever, such traces of skepticism are integrated into an ultimately\nnon-skeptical philosophy. In Contra academicos, Augustine\nrecognizes a core feature of ancient skepticism, namely that it is a\ncommitment to ongoing inquiry. The question that Augustine considers\nvital, then, is whether a life devoted to inquiry can be compelling,\nif seemingly there is no prospect for ever attaining truth\n(cf. Lagerlund 2009). It is as a philosophy of inquiry that skepticism\nmakes a lasting contribution to ethics, continuing, as it were, a\nSocratic legacy (Vogt 2017). \n\nAugustine creates the framework that will become characteristic of\nearly modern discussions. First, in his work skeptical arguments are\nexplored in order to be refuted. Second, the key issue is whether we\nhave knowledge, not whether we should hold anything to be true. In\nAugustine, the background for caring so much about knowledge is the\npressing question of whether we can know God: whether we can know that\nhe exists and what his properties are. This might also be the reason\nwhy knowledge of testimony gains importance (De Trinitate,\n15.12; in Schoedinger 1996). The Bible, or parts of it, might be\nconsidered testimony about God, and accordingly as one possible way of\nattaining knowledge of God. \n\nThird, in the process of asking whether we can have knowledge of God\nit makes sense to distinguish between kinds of knowledge (sensory,\nrational, by testimony, etc.). If we know God, then we do so via one\nof the kinds of knowledge. This becomes a standard feature of\ndiscussions of skepticism. Philosophers go through the different kinds\nof knowledge that are conceivable, and examine them in turn. Fourth,\nAugustine conceives of what he calls ‘inner knowledge.’ He\nenvisages a skeptical scenario. Suppose we have no sensory knowledge,\nno rational knowledge, and no knowledge of testimony. We still know\nthat we think, love, judge, live, and are (De Trinitate\n15.12). In the City of God 11.26, Augustine uses his\nwell-known phrase “si enim fallor, sum” (even if\nI err, I am). That is, Augustine suggests that we have knowledge of\nour mental acts. However, Augustine does not consider these pieces of\nknowledge foundational. While he points to them when he discusses the\nchallenges of Academic skepticism, he does not systematically build\nupon them in refuting skepticism about sense perception, rational\nknowledge, and knowledge of testimony.  Rather, he refutes skepticism\nby stating that God created us and the things that are known to us;\nGod wanted these things to be known to us (De Trinitate\n15.12). In later epistemology, the idea of the turn into one’s mind\nand an introspective access to one’s mental acts becomes a secular\nidea. Augustine is a transitional figure in the philosophy of mind,\nand thereby re-conceives skepticism. By focussing on a gap between\n‘what is in the mind’ and the world outside, he as it were invites\nexternal world skepticism (Vogt 2014a). But for Augustine it is part\nof the path to God: the mind turns into itself and from there it moves\nfurther, toward God (e.g., Confessions 7. 17,23). \n\nNext to Augustine, Al-Ghazali (1085-1111) plays a major role in\nre-conceiving the questions relevant to skepticism (Menn 2003,\nKukkonen 2009). In The Rescuer From Error, Al-Ghazali\nliterally describes God as the rescuer from error (in Khalidi\n2005). Like Augustine before and Descartes after him, Al-Ghazali moves\nthrough different cognitive faculties. Do the senses or reason allow\nus to gain knowledge? These questions are framed by the quest for\nknowledge of God. While Augustine thinks that knowledge of God comes\nthrough a combination of seeking God on the one hand and God’s\ngrace on the other, Al-Ghazali thinks it comes through spiritual\nexercises. However, once confidence in God is secured, trust in the\nmore familiar ways of gaining knowledge—sense perception,\nrational reasoning, and so on—is restored (for a detailed\ntreatment of skepticism in Classical Islam, cf. Heck 2014). \n\nOne key difference between ancient skepticism on the one hand, and\nmedieval as well as Cartesian skepticism on the other, is that ancient\nskepticism is not framed by theological concerns. Note that in\nCartesian skepticism, God is not only invoked when it comes to refuting\nskepticism. More importantly, the skeptical problems arise in a way\nthat depends on God as creator. Our cognitive faculties are seen as\ncreated faculties, and the world as a created world. A kind of\n‘faculty-skepticism’ that asks whether our cognitive faculties are\nbuilt so as to be erroneous is formulated, and a potential gap between\nour minds and the world opens up. Perhaps God made us in such a way\nthat we are fundamentally wrong about everything (or, as later secular\nversions have it, a mad scientist experiments on a “brain in a\nvat”). \n\nThese are important steps away from the non-theological ancient\nconstrual of skepticism. The theological premises of early modern\nskepticism are not only foreign to ancient debates; they would be seen\nas misguided. From the Hellenistic point of view, theology is part of\nphysics. An account of god is part of an account of the natural world\n(as such, it is unrecognizable as ‘theology’ from the\npoint of view of later theologies). Human beings and their cognitive\nfaculties are natural parts of a natural world. They are organic and\nfunctional parts, interconnected with the other parts of the large\nwhole which the universe is. A mind-world-gap (of the kind envisaged\nin the Cartesian tradition) is inconceivable. Each ‘mind,’\nand that is, rational soul, is an integrated physical part of the\nphysical world. Like a part of a complex organism, it would not exist\nwere it not for the interrelations it has with the other parts. A\nphysiological account of the mind makes the stark divide between mind\nand world that figures in early modern skepticism unimaginable. \n\nContemporary discussions inherit long-standing problems from early\nmodern philosophy. Among them, external world skepticism, skepticism\nabout other minds, and skepticism about induction are particularly\nprominent. In assessing ancient skepticism, we might ask whether the\nancients saw these problems. \n\nAmong the skeptical problems of modern philosophy, skepticism about\ninduction stands out. Its early formulation in Hume does not depend on\nthe idea that our faculties are created by God, who also created the\nworld. Hume takes himself to engage with Pyrrhonian skepticism\n(Ainslie 2003). Induction proceeds from particular observations to a\ngeneral conclusion. Skepticism about induction points out that, no\nmatter how many particulars were observed, the general claim\npronounces also on what has not been observed. In this respect, the\ninference seems unwarranted and so we should suspend judgement on its\neffectiveness. Induction can concern the ascription of properties to\nsome kind of entity as well as causal claims. In the latter, the\nskeptic observes that what regularly precedes a type of event may not\nbe its cause. Perhaps we cannot infer anything from the fact that\ncertain properties or events regularly occur together (Vlasits\nforthcoming; for a related argument in Al-Ghazali, cf. Kukkonen\n2009). \n\nRelevant ideas can be traced in various aspects of Sextus’\nphilosophy. First, Sextus sides with anti-rationalist tendencies in\nmedicine. According to these schools, a doctor remembers that, in\nearlier cases, symptom A was alleviated by\nmedication B. They do not infer that medication B\nmakes symptom A disappear, or that the illness C is\nthe cause of symptom A. Second, the Five Modes do not\nexclusively target proof. They address everything that lends\ncredibility to something else. They may thus also call into question\nsigns that are taken as indicative of their causes. Sextus’\nskeptic does not accept such indicative signs. Third, Sextus discusses\nthe role of so-called commemorative signs in the skeptic’s life\n(PH 2.100–102; Allen 2001). For example, a scar is a\ncommemorative sign of a wound. Both were co-observed in the past. A\nskeptic will think of a wound when seeing a scar. But they do not\ncommit to causal or explanatory claims. Fourth, Sextus records a set\nof Causal Modes (PH 1.180–86), which are specifically\ntargeted toward causal explanations (Corti 2014; on the relation\nbetween the Causal Modes and Hume cf. Garrett forthcoming). He does\nnot ascribe the kind of relevance to them that the Ten Modes and the\nFive Modes have. Indeed, he thinks the Five Modes can do the work of\nCausal Modes (that is, call into question causal and explanatory\ntheses and theories). However, the Causal Modes go into great detail\non how the skeptic investigates any kind of causal thesis or\ntheory. \n\nThe distinction between subjectivity and objectivity is central to\nmodern discussions of skepticism. It is not envisaged in ancient\nthought. However, this does not mean that ancient philosophers do not\nreflect on questions relevant to this distinction. Arguably,\nPyrrhonism conceives of the affections of the mind in ways that\nanticipate later thought about subjectivity (Fine 2003a and\n2003b). Sextus describes the skeptic’s states of\n‘being-appeared-to’ as affections of the mind. A skeptic\ncan report these states in their utterances. Illustrating this point,\nSextus uses expressions associated with the Cyrenaics, a Socratic\nschool of thought. These expressions literally mean something like\n‘I am being heated’ or ‘I am being whitened.’\nThey aim to record affections without claiming anything about the\nworld. Fine argues that the skeptic’s beliefs are beliefs about\nthese affections (2000). With this proposal, Fine turns against two\nprominent positions in scholarly debate about skeptical belief (see\nsection 4.4), that skeptics have no beliefs whatsoever, and that they\nhave beliefs that fall short of holding true. Fine envisages\nreflective beliefs: beliefs about one’s states of mind (on the\nrole of such beliefs in contemporary epistemology, cf. Feeney and\nSchellenberg forthcoming; on related contemporary debates about\nperception and belief, cf. Glüer forthcoming). \n\nWhether or not Sextus’ account of the skeptic’s mental\nlife includes reflective beliefs about one’s mental states, we\nshould note an important difference to later proposals of that\nkind. Later philosophers focus on the particular kind of certainty\nattached to reflective knowledge. Reflective knowledge is sometimes\nseen as a stepping-stone towards greater confidence in our cognitive\npowers, and our ability to also attain other kinds of knowledge. But\nit may not be obvious that reflective knowledge can take on this\nimportant role. In this respect, Augustine is still closer to ancient\nthan to modern intuitions. He says that such pieces of knowledge as\n“I know that I think” are not what we are looking\nfor. Augustine envisages that reflective knowledge-claims can be\niterated, so that we would have infinitely many pieces of knowledge\n(“I know that I know that I think…”). But from his\npoint of view, this kind of knowledge leads nowhere. When we ask\nwhether we can have knowledge, we are interested in knowledge of the\nworld and of God (De Trinitate 15.12). \n\nModern philosophers also pay great attention to the privileged access\ncognizers have to their own cognitive activities. Augustine introduces\na distinction that paves the way for this idea. He argues that the\nmind cannot know what kind of stuff it is (De Trinitate 10.10\nand 15.12). The mind does not know its substance, but it knows its\nactivities. For Augustine, this means that the mind knows itself. The\nmind is precisely what it knows itself to be: in knowing that one\nthinks, judges, lives, and so on, one knows the mind (Vogt 2014a).\nNote that this argument indicates that knowing that one lives and is\nare not pieces of knowledge about one’s bodily existence, but about\nthe activities of the mind. \n\nFinally, modern philosophers conceive of the special kind of access\nto one’s own mind not only in contrast with our access to the world.\nThey also compare it to our access to what goes on in other minds. One\nof their core problems is skepticism about other minds. If our own\nminds are accessible to us in the way nothing else is, then we might\nnot be able to ascribe mental states to others. For example, we might\nnot know that someone who looks as if she is in pain really is in\npain. The ancient skeptics envisage nothing of this kind (Warren 2011). This suggests\nthat, insofar as they draw a distinction between affections of the mind\nand the world, this distinction is construed differently than in modern\nskepticism. \n\nIn its early modern versions, external world skepticism involves the\nidea that there is a creator—someone who made the world and our\nfaculties, and the fit or misfit between them. If this assumption is\ncrucial to external world skepticism, then the ancients do not\nconceive of this skeptical problem. From the point of view of modern\nphilosophy, ancient skepticism may appear limited by not addressing\nsome of the most radical skeptical scenarios (Burnyeat 1980 [1997] and\n1982; Williams 1988; Fine 2003a and 2003b). From the point of view of\nancient skepticism, early modern skepticism and the long life that its\nproblems enjoy, however, would seem to originate in a flawed\ntheology. \n\nContemporary philosophers sometimes discuss external world\nskepticism in terms of a paradox: one thinker finds herself torn\nbetween the strength of skeptical arguments and her ordinary\nconvictions. For example, she thinks that this is her hand.\nBut she concedes that the skeptical hypothesis that a mad scientist\nmight have set things up so that she has such perceptions and thoughts\n(the so-called brain in a vat scenario) is hard to refute. This way of\nframing discussions of skepticism is foreign to antiquity. In\nantiquity, skeptics and their opponents are different thinkers, each of\nthem with one set of intuitions, arguing against each other. It is also\nforeign to ancient skepticism insofar as it inherits the early modern\nidea that some greatly powerful agent sets things up, and in a sense\ncreates the thinker’s faculties and the world as it appears to them. \n\nHowever, the ancient skeptics might conceive of their own kind of\nexternal world skepticism. One way to explore this question is to turn\nto the way in which Sextus describes that which is outside of the\nskeptic’s mind (Fine 2003 and 2003(2)). Throughout his work, Sextus\nemploys the distinction between appearances and what really is the\ncase. Consider some of the detail of how he characterizes the latter.\nOne phrase in the Ten Modes is “ta ektos\nhupokeimena,” the externally underlying things\n(PH 1.61, 127, 128, 134, 144). Other phrases, meant to\ndemarcate roughly the same contrast with appearances, are how things\nare in their nature (phusei) (PH 1.78, 123, 140),\n“the underlying things” (hupokeimena) (PH\n1.106), as well as a combination: “the nature of the underlying\nexternal things” (PH 1.117, 163). The expressions which\ncontain the word “external” might read as if Sextus was\ntalking about the external world in a sense familiar to us from early\nmodern skepticism. \n\nBut what are the underlying or external objects, as Sextus conceives\nof them? For example, Sextus speaks of the underlying reality of\nwhether honey really is sweet (PH 1.19). In such a case, it is\nassumed that there are ordinary objects. But we do not have access to\nthe properties they really have (Fine calls this Property Skepticism,\n2003b). However, external objects in Sextus’ sense also include objects\nthat later philosophers would not obviously see as part of the external\nword. For example, an answer to the question of what kind of life\nreally is good would count as a claim about external or underlying\nreality (cf. Pellegrin 2010). \n\nAnother approach to the question of whether Sextus envisages some\nkind of external world skepticism is to turn to his discussions of\nphysics. Ordinarily we take ourselves to live in a world in which there\nare bodies, movement, place, time, and so on. But as Sextus argues, we\ndo not have compelling accounts of any of these core conceptions of\nphysics. This leads to suspension of judgment on whether there are\nbodies, movement, place, time, and so on. Sextus’ discussions of\nphysics might add up to a rather far-reaching skepticism about the\nnatural world.","contact.mail":"kv2101@columbia.edu","contact.domain":"columbia.edu"}]
