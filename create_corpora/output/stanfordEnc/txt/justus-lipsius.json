To understand his motives and his philosophical\nachievements, we must examine the biographical facts. \nBorn a Catholic on 18 October 1547 in Overijse, a small town between\nBrussels and Louvain, Lipsius first studied in Brussels (primary\nschool, Kapelleschool; 1553–1557) and Ath (Latin School,\n1557–1559). He then pursued his studies with the Jesuits in\nCologne (at the Bursa Nova Tricoronata, 1559–1564), returning to\nLouvain where he matriculated at the university on 14 August 1564.\nThere he studied law, while also attending courses by Cornelius\nValerius, professor of Latin, at the Collegium Trilingue, a humanist\ninstitution of Erasmian inspiration; among his fellow students were\nLudovicus Carrio, Janus Dousa, Martin-Antonio Del Río, Andreas\nSchott. Lipsius was already engaged in the emendation and critical\nexamination of Latin texts, especially of Cicero, Propertius and\nVarro; and, as early as 1566, he put together three books of\nVariae lectiones (“Variant Readings”), which were\npublished in 1569 at Antwerp. He embarked on an extended academic\njourney to Italy, ending in Rome, where he became private secretary to\nCardinal Granvelle, to whom he had dedicated his Variae\nlectiones, and where he made the acquaintance of leading\nhumanists such as Marc-Antoine Muret, Fulvio Orsini, Paolo Manuzio and\nGuglielmo Sirleto. \nAfter his journey to Rome, where he was able to examine ancient\nmonuments and consult unique manuscripts in the Vatican Library and\nother well-stocked private libraries (1568-1570), he returned to\nLouvain to continue his legal studies. Fleeing the political and\nreligious conflict in the Low Countries, Lipsius went to visit his\nfriend Carolus Langius (Charles de Langhe) in Liège (1571)\n— Langius would become Lipsius’s master of Roman Stoic\nphilosophy in the dialogue De constantia. \nIn the spring of 1572, Lipsius moved to Vienna where he was introduced\nto the humanist circle at Maximilian’s court, which included\nOgerius Busbequius, Joannes Sambucus and Stephanus Pighius. In October\nLipsius obtained the chair of history at the Lutheran University of\nJena. He also completed his edition of Tacitus, which he dedicated to\nEmperor Maximilian II and in which the Annals were\ndistinguished from the Histories for the first time. He left\nJena briefly in 1573 to marry Anna van den Calstere in Cologne and\nthen for good in 1574, when he returned to the Low Countries. \nAfter a sojourn in Overijse and Louvain, he was invited to the\nCalvinist University of Leiden by Janus Dousa in September 1577. He\nreferred to his Leiden period (from 1578 to 1591) the most productive\nof his scholarly life. Among the numerous writings he published during\nthese years the most important were De constantia and the\nPolitica. \nDue to the bitter controversies arising from the publication of the\nPolitica, Lipsius decided to return to the Catholic Southern\nLow Countries, settling first in Spa and then Liège\n(1591–1592). Having re-embraced the Catholic faith of his youth,\nhe moved in August 1592 to Louvain, where he accepted the chair of\nhistory at the university and the chair of Latin at the Collegium\nTrilingue. In this final period of his life he prepared his edition of\nSeneca and his treatises on Stoic doctrines and physics. He also\ncontinued to write on classical scholarship and political philosophy,\npublishing antiquarian treatises on the cross (De cruce,\n1593), the Roman army (De militia Romana libri quinque,\n1595), Roman fortifications and armaments (Poliorceticon sive de\nmachinis, tormentis, telis libri quinque, 1596), the grandeur of\nRome (Admiranda sive de magnitudine Romana libri quatuor,\n1598), ancient libraries (De bibliothecis syntagma, 1602),\nthe Roman goddess Vesta and the Vestal virgins (De Vesta et\nVestalibus syntagma, 1605), as well as Monita et exempla\npolitica (“Political Advice and Examples,” 1605), an\nextended historical-philosophical “mirror of princes,”\nintended as a sequel to his Politica. In addition, Lipsius,\nappointed Royal Historiographer in 1595, was asked to write devotional\ntracts in honor of the Holy Virgin of Halle and Scherpenheuvel, thus\nsupporting the religious and political agenda of the Archdukes Albert\nand Isabella: the Diva Virgo Hallensis: Beneficia eius et miracula\nfide atque ordine descripta (1604) and Diva Sichemiensis sive\nAspricollis, nova eius beneficia & admiranda (1605). \nLipsius saw to the publication of his own letters, bringing out three\ncollections or Centuriae (since each contained 100 epistles),\nin his lifetime, the first of which appeared in Leiden in 1586. He\nprepared another Centuria for posthumous publication by his\nexecutor Joannes Woverius, who, together with his fellow-executors,\nadded a fifth Centuria postuma. From this vast\ncorrespondence, it is apparent that Lipsius was a central figure in\nthe Republic of Letters of his day, renowned for his philological\nskills, his historical knowledge and his search for a new type of\nhumanitas (civilized and humane conduct) suited to the\ntroubled times in which he lived. The inventory of Lipsius’s\nletters includes more than 4,300 items and 700 correspondents, among\nthem not only Montaigne, but also such distinguished scholars as Isaac\nCasaubon, Henri Estienne, Joseph Scaliger, Sir Philip Sidney, Paolo\nManuzio, Fulvio Orsini, Joannes Sambucus, Joachim Camerarius, Benito\nArias Montano, Francisco de Quevedo, Abraham Ortelius, Hugo Grotius,\nand Philip Rubens, brother of the artist Peter Paul, who immortalized\nLipsius in his painting The Four Philosophers (now in the\nPalazzo Pitti in Florence). Most of the letters reflect\nLipsius’s friendships, thoughts, feelings, teachings and\nattempts at self-presentation. Yet his letter collections were also\nmeant as an extension of his humanist scholarship and his Neostoic\nintellectual program. \nAccording to his Catholic biographers, Lipsius died in Louvain\n“a devout Catholic” during the night of 23 to 24 March\n1606. They recount that he asked his wife to present his fur-trimmed\nrobe to the statue of the Sedes Sapientiae in the church of\nSt Peter at Louvain and that, surrounded by three Jesuits, he\ndisplayed “the constancy of Christian strength”\n(Christiani roboris constantia): when encouraged to think of\nthe consolations of Stoicism, he replied: “those things were\nvain … this [pointing to a crucifix] is true endurance”\n(illa sunt vana … haec est vera patientia).\nLipsius’s return to the Counter-Reformation Catholic Church in\n1591 had prepared the way for this symbolic and propagandistic use of\nhis scholarly genius and image. \nThe young Lipsius began his philological study of Seneca, like that of\nTacitus, during his stay in Rome in 1569. It was Marc-Antoine Muret\nwho first stimulated his interest in Seneca and Roman Stoicism, giving\nrise to a life-long obsession which would alternate between philology\nand philosophy. Lipsius’s philosophical interest in Roman\nStoicism led to the publication of his highly successful Senecan\ndialogue, set in the midst of the violent religious and political\nstruggles of the Netherlands, De constantia in publicis malis\n(“On Constancy in Times of Public Calamity”, 1583/4). This\nwas his earliest attempt to combine Stoicism and Christianity in order\nto create a new philosophy which would help individuals to live\nthrough the difficult period of civil and religious wars which were\ntearing Northern Europe apart. \nA closer look at Lipsius’s first Neostoic work reveals that\nDe constantia was the manifesto of a humanist who was\nconvinced that he had found in Seneca’s philosophy both a\nconsolation and a solution to the public calamities which he and his\ncontemporaries were enduring. From Seneca’s De vita\nbeata (15.8), Lipsius takes the leitmotif: “we are\nborn into a kingdom where obedience to God is true liberty”\n(De constantia I.14). After defining God, providence and\nfate, he comes to necessity (necessitas), the logical\nconclusion of their co-operation: everything which is governed by fate\nhappens by necessity (De constantia I.19). The most obvious\nexample of this natural necessity is the decay and destruction of all\ntemporal things (De constantia I.15–16). \nWhile consoling his readers, Lipsius does not deny the hubris of\npower, the atrocities of history or the cruelty of tyrants and\nemperors. Yet he tries to encourage his readers to adopt an attitude\nof constancy by listing a long series of divinae clades\n(divinely sanctioned disasters): horrifying examples from history\nmeant to illustrate the utility of divine punishment and to\ndemonstrate that evils such as earthquakes, pestilence, war and\ntyranny are part and parcel of the human condition — indeed, of\nGod’s plan for the preservation and improvement of the whole\nworld. Moreover, he argues, the evils of the present time are neither\nparticularly grave nor worse than those which existed in the past:\n“Just as work becomes easier if shared by more people, so too\ndoes sorrow” (De constantia II.26). \nThe truly wise man is therefore expected to accept the law of\nnecessity (lex necessitatis) with steadfastness and mental\nfortitude While realizing “that man is but a dream of a\nshadow,” he should show disdain for the course of human events\nby cultivating constantia: “the upright and immovable\nmental strength, which is neither lifted up nor depressed by external\nor accidental circumstances” (De constantia I.4). The\nmother of this constancy is patience, which is governed by reason.\nReason (ratio) — as opposed to false opinions —\nis nothing other than a true judgment concerning things both human and\ndivine. It is this internal transformation — based on the\nessential Stoic attributes of reason, freedom from the emotions,\npatience in adversity and subjection to God’s will — which\nmakes it possible to live contentedly amid the inevitable decay and\nturmoil of the world. \nSo, “enveloped by the mist and clouds of opinion” (De\nconstantia I.2), we must never stop attempting to conquer our\npassions and emotions (adfectus) — desire, joy, fear\nand pain (cupiditas, gaudium, metus and\ndolor) — and our false opinions by means of reason. Not\nonly do emotions disturb the equilibrium of the soul and impede\nconstancy, they are false and dangerous, since they can upset the\ndetachment needed by the wise man(sapiens). Consequently, it\nis necessary “to steel our mind and so temper it that we may\nachieve peace in the midst of turmoil and tranquility in the midst of\nconflict” (De constantia I.1). If reason, the lawful\nruler of our mind, can conquer our passions and false opinions, we\nwill be able to face public and private evil with true constancy. Due\nto three emotions, however —simulatio or deception,\npietas or patriotism, and miseratio or pity for\nmisfortunes of others — we all carry war around within\nourselves. Even worse, what appears to us to be a virtue is actually a\nvice, for thinking that we suffer on account of the sufferings of our\ncountry causes us to grieve for our self and our property, while pity\nfor the sufferings of others is unworthy of a wise man. We must\ntherefore obey the Stoic injunction to extirpate all these harmful\nemotions. \nThe dialogue between Lipsius and his old friend Langius — cast\nin the role of the Stoic sapiens who had achieved mastery\nover his emotions by reason — was clearly intended to provide\nreaders with something simpler than contemporary philosophy, which\nLipsius criticized for its excessive subtlety, and to establish\nconstancy as the chief virtue. Lipsius’s De constantia\nthus has a different focus from the Senecan treatise De constantia\nsapientis (“On the Constancy of the Wise Man”), on\nwhich it was ostensibly modeled; for in chapters 1–12 of Book I\nLipsius puts forward the virtue of constancy as a remedy for the\nturmoil of the times and urges readers to detach themselves completely\nfrom all feelings which might lead to any sort of emotional\ninvolvement in the political and religious wars which were raging\naround them. \nNevertheless, he did not counsel withdrawal from public affairs and\nretreat into private life. Stoics and Christians were cosmopolitans,\nwhose “true native land was the heavens.” They\n“should be good citizens in order to be good men” (De\nconstantia 1.12) and, as such, yield to God’s plan for\nmankind and to the immutable power of providence. \nThe result of Lipsius’s repackaging of Stoic apatheia\n(emotionlessness) as an appropriate antidote to the religious and\npolitical passions of his day and of his transformation of Stoic fate\ninto Christian divine providence (by subordinating fate to God instead\nof vice versa) was that his brand of Neostoicism became as suitable\nfor Christians as the Aristotelianism of Thomas Aquinas and the\nPlatonism of Marsilio Ficino. \nAlthough De constantia was not Lipsius’s most\nsystematic or theoretical treatment of Stoic ethics, but rather a book\nof practical psychology, a manual for wise living, it acquired a\nleading position in European thought. Going through more than eighty\neditions between the sixteenth and the eighteenth centuries, over\nforty in the original Latin and the rest in translations into a wide\nrange of modern European languages, the treatise, which embodied\nelements of militant Calvinism together with arguments on free will\nused by the Jesuits, became common cultural property during the\nBaroque period, influencing scholarship, poetry and art up to the\nEnlightenment. \nLipsius’s Politicorum sive Civilis doctrinae libri sex\n(“Six Books on Politics or Civil Doctrine”, 1589),\ndedicated to Count Maurice of Nassau, can be considered a sequel to\nDe constantia: “just as in On Constancy we\ninstructed citizens how to endure and obey, so here [we instruct]\nthose who rule how to govern,” Lipsius stated in “The\nLetter to the Reader.” In the same way that the citizen had to\nfollow reason (ratio), the ruler had to apply reason and\npolitical virtue to government, but first of all to his own life,\nsince if “he desires to subject all things to himself, he should\nsubject himself to reason first.” \nDrawing on a wide range of classical sources, above all Tacitus,\nLipsius’s subject in the treatise was specifically how to rule\nprincipalities. While political thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle and\nmany others had already written on this topic, they had dealt with it\nmore generally, not in relation to principalities. The one important\nexception was Machiavelli, who “led his prince along the right\nway to the temple of virtue and honor,” but “while\npursuing the path of utility, he wandered from the royal road.”\nThe humanist Lipsius intended to be practical but to avoid any\nconcrete and contemporary applications of the general principles he\nset out. \nLipsius constructed his book from quotations of ancient writers\n— in itself a humanist tour de force, enabling him to\nshow off his vast knowledge of classical literature. Montaigne\ndescribed it as “a learned and carefully woven fabric.”\nYet, although the treatise has been characterized as not much more\nthan a compendium of quotations, Lipsius himself emphasized that the\nPolitica was not a mere compilation. Since he had imposed\norder on the quotations, he expressed his own thought, following the\nstrict rules of Ramist logic, through the authority of the ancients.\nMoreover, in addition to classical writers, Lipsius drew on medieval\nand Renaissance political philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas, the\nSpanish scholastics, Jean Bodin and Niccolò Machiavelli. \nThe Politica, divided into six books, was concerned with the\nconstruction of civil life and the state in an ethical context. The\nfirst book was devoted to an analysis of two necessary conditions:\nvirtue (virtus), which requires piety and goodness; and\nprudence (prudentia) which is dependent on use and historical\nmemory. The second book deals with the virtues of the prince as well\nas the purpose of government and its various forms. Civil concord, a\ncentral issue for Lipsius, requires everyone to submit to the will of\nthe prince, who himself must have both virtue and prudence in order to\nachieve this concord. In the third book Lipsius, in line with medieval\nand humanist mirrors of princes, focused on the distinctive virtue of\nthe prince: political prudence (prudentia civilis), for which\nhe depends both on himself and the advice of others (officials,\ncouncilors, military commanders). A prudent prince must be surrounded\nby prudent advisors. In the fourth and by far the longest book, the\nprince’s own prudence (both civil and military), which must be\ncarefully developed in the light of experience, is discussed. Two\ntypes of civil prudence — the first concerned with divine\nmatters and the second with human affairs — are set out in the\nrest of Book IV. Lipsius’s controversial chapters on the\ndifficult relationship of the state to the church and on religious\ntoleration — in his view, peace and unity could only be achieved\nif just one religion was allowed in any particular political community\n— provoked sharp attacks both from Protestants, especially Dirk\nVolckertsz. Coornhert, and from the Roman Inquisition, which in 1590\nplaced the Politica on the Index of Prohibited Books.\nAccording to Lipsius, the prince should not intervene in the internal\naffairs of the church, much less meddle with doctrinal issues: he had\nno “rights in sacred matters” (ius in sacra;\nPolitica, IV.2). It was, however, his right and, indeed, duty\nto secure the unity of the church, since religious discord inevitably\nled to civil disruption and war. Those religious dissidents who were\nresponsible for the strife that was tearing Europe apart deserved no\nmercy: “Burn, cut — for the whole body [of the state] is\nof greater value than some of its limbs” (Lipsius took this\nprovocative medical metaphor from Cicero). On the other hand,\ndissidents who practiced their faith quietly and peacefully were to be\ntreated with toleration. In Books V and VI of the Politica,\nwhich dealt with military prudence, Lipsius explored issues concerning\ndefense, the just war (bellum iustum), discipline and civil\nconflicts. \nLipsius’s Politica, written in the heated atmosphere of\ncivil wars and radical attempts at religious reform, can be seen as an\nattempt to produce a synthesis between the traditional mirror of\nprinces, a popular genre among humanists, and Machiavelli’s\nPrince. Lipsius was a self-proclaimed supporter of monarchy\nand a moderate form of absolutism, at least when based on Stoic\nvirtues. The way to prevent a monarch from abusing his power was not\nto threaten him with revolt or tyrannicide, but rather to educate him\nthoroughly in Stoic ethics. Lipsius’s ideal monarchy was not\nbased on amoral despotism or Machiavellian power. Its foundation was\ninstead Neostoic moral philosophy, whose precepts and doctrines would\nensure that unruly emotions were governed by reason. \nLipsius’s own traumatic experiences in the bloody civil wars of\nhis day surely explain, at least in part, his obsessive concern for\nunity in both state and religion, the secular authority\n(auctoritas) of the prince and the disciplined obedience of\nthe citizenry. Decades before Thomas Hobbes, Lipsius placed order and\npeace, which alone could guarantee political stability, far above\ncivil liberties and personal freedom. That is why Lipsius, writing in\nCalvinist Leiden, argued in favor of a more powerful central authority\nin order to control revolutionary forces in an efficient way. The\nprince’s authority must be as strong as possible, reinforcing\nhis subjects’ opinion of him. He has at his disposal three\ninstruments of power (praecipua vis imperii) to achieve this:\nhis commands, his actual power (depending on wealth, army, advisors,\nalliances and God’s will) and, finally, his moral standards.\nVoluntary obedience and common consent, together with the peace and\nunity which they produce, are secured by the efficient operation of\nthese three instruments (Politica IV.9). \nAlthough the claim that Lipsius’s Politica\n“launched the anti-Machiavellian tradition of the\nCounter-Reformation” (Birely, 99) is no doubt exaggerated, it is\ncertainly true that the treatise found a wide audience and met with\nimmense success. More than Jean Bodin in his Six Books of the\nRepublic (1576) or Johannes Althusius in his\nPolitics Methodically Set Forth (1603), Lipsius dealt with\nthe issues which genuinely agitated his contemporaries. Even before\nthe Politica came off the presses in Leiden, Lipsius was\npreparing himself for the criticism which he expected to encounter. In\na second edition, which appeared in 1590, he included some Breves\nnotae (“Brief Notes”) on the first three books; and a\nyear later he published Liber de una religione (“Book\non One Religion”), written in response to Coornhert’s\nobjections to his views on toleration. After returning to the Catholic\nSouthern Low Countries, Lipsius rewrote the Politica. This\n“Catholic” version, published in Antwerp in 1596 and\nsupplied with additional notes, was an attempt to meet the criticisms\nof the Roman Church. Although both versions circulated throughout\nEurope, crossing confessional boundaries, the Politica was\nmost enthusiastically received in France, Germany and Spain. During\nthe reign of Henri IV alone, the Politica was published ten\ntimes in French translation. The treatise exerted a notable influence\non Pierre Charron, author of De la sagesse (On\nWisdom, 1601), Cardinal Richelieu, Duke Maximilian of Bavaria and\nthe Count-Duke Olivares, among many others. \nLipsius’s De constantia whetted the appetite of his\ncontemporaries for further works on ancient moral philosophy. As\nMontaigne, one of its admiring readers, wrote: \nLipsius did, in fact, go on to supply such an account, at least in\nrelation to Stoic thought. Fearing that his poor health would prevent\nhim from completing his edition and commentary on Seneca, Lipsius, at\nthe end of 1602, decided to publish beforehand his Manuductio ad\nStoicam philosophiam (“Guide to Stoic Philosophy”)\nand Physiologia Stoicorum (“Physical Theory of the\nStoics”). A third work in this series, to be entitled\nEthica, was planned but never completed. In the two published\ntreatises, which came out in 1604, Lipsius attempted to reconstruct a\ncoherent philosophical system of Stoicism, focusing, as he had done in\nDe constantia, on its compatibility with Christian\ndoctrine. \nAlthough Lipsius made a thorough study of all the ancient Stoic\nsources available to readers of his time, the Manuductio was\nnot a mere anthology of quotations. Using his well-honed skills as a\nclassical scholar, he meticulously analyzed the philological,\nhistorical and philosophical aspects of Greek and Roman Stoic\nwritings, relying primarily on Seneca and Epictetus, but also taking\ninto account Cicero, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius and a host of other\nancient writers, including Plato, Philo Judaeus, Apuleius,\n(pseudo-)Hermes Trismegistus and Sextus Empiricus. We also find\nquotations from Scriptures and from a variety of Greek and Latin\nChurch Fathers — Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Minucius\nFelix, Lactantius, Eusebius and St Augustine —together with\nlater Christian writers such as Orosius and Isidore of Seville.\nLipsius drew on these thinkers not only because of the historical or\nphilosophical information which they provided on Stoic philosophers\nand their doctrines but also to demonstrate the uninterrupted interest\nin Stoic philosophy of later centuries. \nThe Manuductio starts with a history of the most important\nphilosophical schools which existed in antiquity, followed by a\ndiscussion of the origin and succession of the various Stoic schools,\ntheir different views on the definition and parts of philosophy. He\nthen comes to the Stoic conception of the truly wise man. Taking his\ncue from Aristotle (Metaphysics 982a), Lipsius asserts that\nthe main characteristic of the wise man is that “he knows in a\nsense all the instances that fall under the universal”\n(Manuductio II.8). The wise man (sapiens) —\nwhom, following the Greek Stoic Panaetius, Lipsius regarded as in a\nstate of progress (proficiens) — will therefore study\nthe physical phenomena and their causes, learning the laws of nature\nand their relationship to the rules of conduct in order to discover\nthe nature of good and evil. If ethical precepts are to lead to\nwisdom, they must be reinforced by general doctrines and moral\ntraining. Contrary to the Stoic belief that both God and nature need\nto be comprehended by the use of reason, Lipsius — embracing\nhere a Platonic epistemology more in line with Christianity —\nsaw the understanding of God and his works as a divine gift\n(Manuductio II.10). The road to wisdom, however, can only be\ndiscovered by following the rules of conduct laid down by nature. This\ntruth must be deduced by reasoning, which explains Lipsius’s\nelaborate account of the Stoic theory of knowledge. Both philosophical\ndoctrines and moral precepts are necessary and complementary to one\nanother for an appreciation of the virtues and as guides to the good\nlife. Without a Stoic understanding of the world and of the supreme\ngood (summum bonum), life cannot be lived happily. According\nto Lipsius (who quotes Seneca’s De vita beata), living\nhappily is the same as living according to nature (Manuductio\nII.15). \nLipsius devotes considerable attention to this important Stoic dictum.\nBecause there were only a few extant ancient testimonies, confusion\narose as to the precise meaning of man’s supreme good. Even\nStobaeus had acknowledged that “to live according to\nnature” could be the same as “living according to the\nGood” and “living well.” Lipsius correctly\nunderstood that ‘living in accordance with nature’ was\nequivalent to “living according to virtue,” so that the\ngoal was harmony with nature, with the universal law of the world and\nwith the particular rational nature of man. In his Christianized\nreading of Stoic ethics, however, Lipsius adopted the more religious\nphrasing of Seneca and Epictetus, so that “living according to\nnature or virtue” became “living according to right\nreason,” which the Stoics identified with Zeus or God,\n“the lord and ruler of everything” (Manuductio\nII.16, referring to Diogenes Laertius VII.88). Consequently, the wise\nman was the one who obeyed God. \nHaving quoted the same passage in De constantia (I.14), in a\nsimilarly religious vein, Lipsius once again asserted, with his\n“Christian” Seneca, that “we are born into a kingdom\nwhere obedience to God is true liberty” (Manuductio\nIII.12). Here, however, he explained why the ancient Greek Stoic\nCleanthes could rightly say that our common, universal nature is God\nhimself. If man is to obey his own nature, Lipsius argued, he must not\noppose the universal laws of human nature; and these laws are dictated\nby the reason or logos which the Stoics equated with God. \nReason, for Lipsius, is a constituent part of the nature which will\nlead man to a life of virtue (Manuductio II.17). Not\nsurprisingly, however, he replaces the Stoic logos with the\nChristian logos or “Word of God” from the Gospel\nof St John. Our own individual natures, as parts of nature or God,\nfunction in the same way as do souls in the human body: they are God\ndwelling in the human frame (Manuductio II.19). By\nidentifying the Stoic logos with the Christian God, Lipsius\nis able to conclude, along with Cicero and Clement of Alexandria, that\nthe Stoic supreme good is equivalent to faith in God. Virtue and\nwisdom come from the source of all knowledge: God. The Platonic\ncontemplation of the Good and the Stoic exploration of the\nrelationship of individual to universal nature are both tantamount to\nthe study of God and his logos, Christ. Therefore, the virtue\nwhich the Stoics regard as the summum bonum is the right\nattitude towards God; and this virtue is the only way to achieve the\ngood life (Manuductio II.19). \nStarting from the Stoic dictum that the summum bonum consists\nof virtue alone and that only virtue is good, Lipsius maintains,\nfollowing Seneca (Letter LXXI.4), that the supreme good must\nalso be honestum or morally honorable, and that it is limited\nto the soul, the rational part of man (Manuductio II.20). If\neverything is judged in relation to the standard of its own good, this\nstandard in man is reason. A man whose soul possesses reason has\ncomplete control over good and evil. In contrast to the views of the\nPlatonists and Peripatetics, Seneca considers virtue to be sufficient\non its own for the honorable life, and for the virtuous life, man\nneeds to be concerned solely with his own conduct. Like Seneca’s\nsapiens, Lipsius’s wise man,having control over\nhimself, chooses external things only when they are in accordance with\nnature and, as such, morally honorable. External things are good\nbecause the wise man, in his prudence and virtue, has selected them.\nChoosing rationally among things which are natural but indifferent\nwith respect to happiness is the foundation of true virtuous action.\nBecause only that which is perfect by nature can be called the good\n— just as the summum bonum is located in God, who is\nperfect — the good does not exist in man until both he and his\nreason are perfected (Manuductio II.22, referring to Seneca,\nLetter CXXIV). \nFor all his devotion to the Stoics, Lipsius presented a rather\neclectic account of their moral philosophy, cutting and trimming as\nreligious orthodoxy required, since by no means all Stoic teachings\nwere compatible with Christianity. It was for this reason that he\nrejected the Stoic doctrine of ethically indifferent actions\n(Manuductio II.23). It also explains why he embraced some of\nthe Stoic paradoxes, such as the notion that a kingdom should please\nthe wise man no more than slavery (Manuductio III.12), which\nreinforced Christian humility, while rejecting others, such as the\nStoic dictum that the wise man was, by his own decision, at liberty to\ntake his own life (Manuductio III.22–23), which was\nblatantly opposed to Christian belief. \nCentral to Lipsius’s insight into Stoic philosophy was his\nperception that its ethics and physics were inseparable: it was not\npossible to live one’s life in accordance with nature, as Stoic\nethics demanded, without a full knowledge of the physical workings of\nnature. He develops this theme most fully in the companion piece to\nthe Manuductio, the Physiologia Stoicorum. \nIn this treatise Lipsius attempts not only to reconstruct Stoic\nnatural philosophy in detail, following the traditional didactic order\nof the doxographical tradition, but also to reassert its importance\nfor Stoic ethics and theology. Here again the main burden of\nLipsius’s work is to explain away conflicts between Stoic\nphysics and Christianity or, failing that, to remove unresolved\ncontradictions from his Christianized, Neostoic natural philosophy. To\nachieve this goal, he employs three different techniques for dealing\nwith problematic Stoic doctrines: interpreting them allegorically,\nfinding similarities with Christian beliefs and imposing Neoplatonic\n“corrections” on them. \nLipsius made his intentions clear right from the start. Endorsing the\nStoic position that the study of nature and its workings was an\nindispensable part of philosophy, he cited the well-known statements\nof Plato (Theaetetus 155D) and Aristotle\n(Metaphysics 982b) that amazement was the motive force of\nphilosophy (Physiologia I.2). In addition, he maintained that\nthe study of higher matters, such as the true nature of God and the\nuniversal laws of nature, could serve as an antidote to involvement in\npetty quarrels — the same role which, in De constantia,\nhe had assigned to constancy and the Stoic mastery of the emotions by\nreason. \nLipsius connected the Stoic definition of nature found in Diogenes\nLaertius (VII.156), “a craftsmanlike fire proceeding to\ncreate,” to the one provided by Stobaeus (Eclogues\nI.29) and Plutarch (in fact he quotes Aetius; cf. SVF II.1027):\n“God is a craftmanlike fire proceeding methodically to create\nthe world, and containing within itself all the seminal reasons; then,\nin accordance with these, everything is constructed by fate”\n(Physiologia I.6). \nAccording to Lipsius, this showed that the Stoics believed the world\nto be the principal creation of God, in whom were contained the seeds\nof fate which controlled the birth of individual things. This fire or\nGod, containing the seminal reasons (rationes seminales),\nideas or forms of all existing things, is a Lipsian innovation,\nderiving from the Neoplatonic and Christian traditions (he quotes John\nof Damascus, De orthodoxa fide 13). Lipsius compares this\nnotion to the biblical account of Moses seeing the light glowing in\nthe bush (Exod. 3:2) and the pillar of fire which leads the Israelites\nthrough the wilderness (Exod. 14:19), and also to the burning tongues\nof the Apostles (Acts 2:3; Physiologia I.6). \nLipsius is indebted as well to the Corpus Hermeticum, which\nhe frequently cites when dealing with the notion of Platonic ideas and\ntheir relation to God. Arguing that God is not only the divine fire of\nthe Stoics but also the spiritus igneus (“fiery\nbreath”), he quotes Posidonius and Hermes Trismegistus, with the\naim of demonstrating that a similar view can be found in Christianity:\nno one sees God, and yet everyone sees God daily in all things\n(Physiologia Stoicorum I.7, citing Stobaeus,\nEclogues I.2.19 and Corpus Hermeticum XI.16). He\nrejects, however, as incompatible with Christianity, the Stoics’\npantheistic equation of God with the world and their belief that the\ndivine principle is corporeal (Physiologia I.8). \nLipsius was nonetheless prepared to accept the view of God as the\nworld soul, which permeates every living thing (Physiologia\nI.8–9). He identified fate with God’s providential reason\n(Physiologia I.12) and adopted St Augustine’s view\n(De civitate Dei V.8) that fate does not impinge in any way\non the free will of God (Physiologia I.12). Although fate\ncauses everything, not every action is a direct result of it. Human\nbeings thus preserve their moral liberty and responsibility in the\nsphere of causae secundae (“secondary causes”).\nLipsius was a Christian thinker, as well as a Stoic one, and in this\ncapacity he drew on Aristotle’s De generatione\nanimalium (769a-773a) to explain the existence of evil in a world\ncreated by a supremely benevolent God: deformed creatures and\nmonstrosities which seem to be contrary to nature are actually in\naccordance with the overall plan of nature and divine providence\n(Physiologia I.13). \nIf Lipsius did violence to the Stoic conceptions of matter, body and\nGod in order to keep faith with Christianity, he also violated certain\nChristian teachings when defending the Stoic view of the soul as a\nvital pneuma (“spirit” or “breath”;\nPhysiologia III.9, citing Diogenes Laertius VII.157). A more\ndetailed analysis of Stoic beliefs about the soul might have brought\nto the surface embarrassing incompatibilities with Christian doctrine.\nThis would not have suited his selective approach to Stoicism, whose\npurpose was to produce a perfect marriage of pagan and Christian\nelements, which would serve to enhance the truths of Christianity.\nHowever inelegant some of Lipsius’s “adaptations”\nmight seem, they belonged to the carefully considered program of a\nhumanist who, by promoting free will, virtue and social commitment,\nbased on a synthesis of Christian and Stoic ethics, wanted to achieve\nan acceptable, unifying and practicable Christian\nhumanitas. \nIt should be emphasized that Lipsius did not seek to develop a new\nphilosophy but rather wanted to produce a better “understanding\nof Seneca.” Nevertheless, it has been claimed that his\nelucidation of Stoicism gave new meaning to concepts such as freedom,\ndetermination, nature and reason, providence and God, and provided\nEuropean intellectuals with a new awareness of the world, rationality,\nfree will and individuality. It is well known that Lipsian Neostoicism\nhad a direct influence on many seventeenth-century writers —\nGuillaume du Vair, Montesquieu, Bishop Bossuet and Pierry Bayle in\nFrance; Francis Bacon and Joseph Hall in England; and Francisco de\nQuevedo and Juan de Vera y Figueroa in Spain, to name but a few. One\ncould go further and say that no mention of Stoicism in the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries was complete without a reference\nto Lipsius’s Manuductio, which became the classic work\non Stoicism for a century and a half. The most important histories of\nphilosophy — e.g., those by Georgius Hornius (1620–1670),\nThomas Stanley (1625–1678), Gerardus Johannes Vossius\n(1577–1649), Joannes Jonsius (1624–1659), Henning Witte\n(1634–1696), Johannes Franciscus Buddeus (1667–1729),\nBurckhard Gotthelf Struve (1671–1738),Christoph August Heumann\n(1681–1764) or Johann Jakob Brucker (1696–1770) —\nall cite Lipsius’s historical and philosophical introductions to\nStoic physics and morals. His two systematic treatises on Stoic\nphilosophy, “pleading its cause before the court of\nChristianity” (Spanneut, 239), found a prominent place in the\nlibrary of Spinoza and of other major philosophers of the early modern\nera, including Descartes and Leibniz; and it was from Lipsius that\nLocke first learned about Roman Stoicism.","contact.mail":"Jan.Papy@arts.kuleuven.be","contact.domain":"arts.kuleuven.be"}]
