But his fame did not\nlast, either in Italy or in the English speaking world. He did not\nlack promulgators and willing translators into English: H. Carr was an\nearly example of the former, R. G. Collingwood was both, and\nD. Ainslie did the latter service for most of Croce’s principal\nworks.  But his star rapidly declined after the Second World\nWar. Indeed it is hard to find a figure whose reputation has fallen so\nfar and so quickly; this is somewhat unfair not least because\nCollingwood’s aesthetics is still studied, when its main ideas\nare mostly borrowed from Croce. The causes are a matter for\nspeculation, but two are likely. First, Croce’s general\nphilosophy was very much of the preceding century. As the idealistic\nand historicist systems of Bradley, Green, and Joachim were in Britain\nsuperseded by Russell and Ayer and analytical philosophy,\nCroce’s system was swept away by new ideas on the\ncontinent—from Heidegger on the one hand to deconstructionism on\nthe other. Second, Croce’s manner of presentation in his famous\nearly works now seems, not to put too fine a point on it, dismissively\ndogmatic; it is full of the youthful conviction and fury that seldom\nwears well. On certain key points, opposing positions are\ncharacterized as foolish, or as confused expressions of simple truths\nthat only waited upon Croce to articulate properly. Of course, these\ndismissals carry some weight—Croce’s reading is prodigious\nand there is far more insight beneath the words than initially meets\nthe eye—but unless the reader were already convinced that here\nat last is the truth, their sheer number and vehemence will arouse\nmistrust. And since the early works, along with his long running\neditorship of the journal La Critica, rocketed him to such\nfame and admiration, whereas later years were devoted among other\nthings to battling with while being tolerated by fascists, it’s\nnot surprising that he never quite lost this habit.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Croce’s signal contribution to\naesthetics—that art is expression—can be more or less be\ndetached from the surrounding philosophy and polemics. In what\nfollows, we will first see the doctrine as connected to its original\nphilosophical context, then we will attempt to snip the\nconnections.\n\n\n\nWe are confining ourselves to Croce’s aesthetics, but it will\nhelp to have at least the most rudimentary sketch in view of his rather\ncomplex general philosophy. \n\nIn Italy at the beginning of the twentieth century, the prevailing\nphilosophy or ‘world-view’ was not, as in England,\npost-Hegelian Idealism as already mentioned, but the early forms of\nempiricist positivism associated with such figures as Comte and\nMach. Partly out of distaste for the mechanism and enshrinement of\nmatter of such views, and partly out of his reaction, both positive\nand negative, to the philosophy of Hegel, Croce espoused what he\ncalled ‘Absolute Idealism’ or ‘Absolute\nHistoricism’. A constant theme in Croce’s philosophy is that he\nsought a path between the Scylla of ‘transcendentalism’\nand the Charybdis of ‘sensationalism’, which for most\npurposes may be thought of as co-extensive with rationalism and\nempiricism. For Croce, they are bottom the same error, the error of\nabstracting from ordinary experience to something not literally\nexperienceable. Transcendentalism regards the world of sense to be\nunreal, confused or second-rate, and it is the philosopher, reflecting\non the world in a priori way from his armchair, who sees\nbeyond it, to reality.  What Croce called ‘Sensationalism’, on the\nother hand, regards only instantaneous impressions of colour and the\nlike as existing, the rest being in some sense a mere logical\nconstruction out of it, of no independent reality. The right path is\nwhat Croce calls immanentism: All but only lived human\nexperience, taking place concretely and without reduction, is\nreal. Therefore all Philosophy, properly so-called, is Philosophy of\nSpirit (or Mind), and is inseparable from history.  And thus Croce’s\nfavoured designations, ‘Absolute Idealism’ or\n‘Absolute Historicism’. \n\nPhilosophy admits of the following divisions, corresponding to the\ndifferent modes of mental or spiritual activity. Mental activity is\neither theoretic (it understands or contemplates) or it is practical\n(it wills actions). These in turn divide: The theoretic divides into\nthe aesthetic, which deals in particulars (individuals or intuitions),\nand logic or the intellectual domain, which deals in concepts and\nrelations, or universals. The practical divides into the\neconomic—by which Croce means all manner of utilitarian\ncalculation—and the ethical or moral. Each of the four domains\nare subject to a characteristic norm or value: aesthetic is subject to\nbeauty, logic is subject to truth, economic is subject to the useful\n(or vitality), and the moral is subject to the good. Croce devoted\nthree lengthy books written between 1901 and 1909 to this overall\nscheme of the ‘Philosophy of Spirit’:\nAesthetic (1901) and (1907) (revised), Logic (1909)\nand the Philosophy of the Practical (1908), the latter\ncontaining both the economic and ethics (in today’s use of term\nyou might call the overall scheme Croce’s metaphysics,\nbut Croce himself distanced himself from that appellation). \n\nPhilosophers since Kant customarily distinguish intuitions or\nrepresentations from concepts or universals. In one sense Croce\nfollows this tradition, but another sense his view departs\nradically. For intuitions are not blind without concepts; an\nintuitive presentation is a complete conscious manifestation just as\nit is, in advance of applying concepts (and all that is true a\npriori of them is that they have a particular character or\nindividual physiognomy—they are not necessarily spatial or\ntemporal, contra Kant). To account for this, Croce supposes\nthat the modes of mental activity are in turn arranged at different\nlevels. The intellect presupposes the intuitive mode—which just\nis the aesthetic—but the intuitive mode does not presuppose the\nintellect. The intellect—issuing in particular\njudgements—in turn is presupposed by the practical, which issues\namong other things in empirical laws. And morality tells the practical\nsciences what ends in particular they should pursue. Thus Croce\nregarded this as one of his key insights: All mental activity, which\nmeans the whole of reality, is founded on the aesthetic, which has no\nend or purpose of its own, and of course no concepts or\njudgements. This includes the concept of existence or reality: the\nintuition plus the judgement of existence is what Croce calls\nperception, but itself is innocent of it. \n\nTo say the world is essentially history is to say that at the lowest\nlevel it is aesthetic experiences woven into a single fabric, a\nworld-narrative, with the added judgement that it is real, that it\nexists. Croce takes this to be inevitable: the subjective present\nis real and has duration; but any attempt to determine its exact size\nis surely arbitrary. Therefore the only rigorous view is that the\npast is no less real than the present. History then represents,\nby definition, the only all-encompassing account of reality. What we\ncall the natural sciences then are impure, second-rate. Consider\nfor example the concept of a space-time point. Plainly\nit is not something anyone has ever met with in experience; it is an\nabstraction, postulated as a limit of certain operations for the\nconvenience of a ‘theory’. Croce would call it a\npseudo-concept, and would not call the so-called ‘empirical\nlaws’ in which it figures to be fit subjects for truth and\nknowledge. Its significance, like that of other pseudo-concepts,\nis pragmatic. \n\nIn fact the vast majority of concepts—house, reptile,\ntree—are mere adventitious collections of things that are\nformulated in response to practical needs, and thus cannot, however\nexact the results of the corresponding science, attain to truth or\nknowledge. Nor do the concepts of mathematics escape the\n‘pseudo’ tag. What Croce calls pure concepts, in\ncontrast, are characterised by their possession of expressiveness,\nuniversality and concreteness, and they perform their office by a\npriori synthesis (this accounts for character mentioned\nabove). What this means it that everything we can perceive or\nimagine—every representation or intuition—will necessarily\nhave all three: there is no possible experience that is not of\nsomething concrete, universal in the sense of being an instance of\nsomething absolutely general, and expressive, that is, admitting of\nverbal enunciation. Empirical concepts, then, like\nheat, are concrete but not universal; mathematical concepts,\nlike number, are universal but not concrete. Examples of\npure concepts are rare, but those recognized by Croce are finality,\nquality and beauty. Such is the domain of Logic, in\nCroce’s scheme. \n\nA critical difference, for our purposes, between Croce’s ideas\nand those of his follower Collingwood, emerges when we ask: what are\nthe constituents of the intuition? For\nCollingwood—writing in the mid-1930s—intuitions are\nbuilt up out of sense-data, the only significant elaboration of\nRussell’s doctrine being that sense-data are never simple,\ncomprising what analysis reveals as sensory and affective\nconstituents. For Croce the intuition is an organic whole, such\nthat to analyze it into atoms is always a false abstraction: the\nintuition could never be re-built with such elements. (Although a\ndeadly opponent of formal logic, Croce did share Frege’s insight\nthat the truly meaningful bit of language is the sentence; ‘only\nin the context of sentence does a word have a meaning’, wrote\nFrege in 1884). \n\nWith such an account of ‘the aesthetic’ in view, one\nmight think that Croce intends to cover roughly the same ground as\nKant’s Transcendental Aesthetic, and like Kant will think of art\nas a comparatively narrow if profound region of experience.\nBut Croce takes the opposite line (and finds Kant’s theory of beauty and\nart to have failed at precisely this point): art is everywhere, and the\ndifference between ordinary intuition and that of ‘works of\nart’ is only a quantitative difference\n(Aes.13). This principle has for Croce a profound\nsignificance: \n\nBut the point is not that every object is to some degree a work of\nart. The point is that every intuition has to some\ndegree the qualities of the intuition of a work of art; it’s just\nthat the intuition of a work of art has them in much greater\ndegree. \n\nWe now reach the most famous and notorious Crocean doctrine\nconcerning art. ‘To intuite’, he writes, ‘is to\nexpress’ (Aes. 11); ‘intuitive knowledge is\nexpressive knowledge’. There are several points that have\nto be in place in order to understand what Croce means by this, because\nit obviously does not strike one as initially plausible. \n\nFor our purposes, it is simplest to regard Croce as an idealist, for\nwhom there is nothing besides the mind. So in that sense, the work of\nart is an ideal or mental object along with everything else; no\nsurprise there, but no interest either. But he still maintains the\nordinary commonplace distinction between mental things—thoughts,\nhopes and dreams—and physical things—tables and trees. And\non this divide, the work of art, for Croce, is still\na mental thing. In other words, the work of art in doubly\nideal; to put it another way,\neven if Croce were a dualist—or a physicalist with some\nmeans of reconstructing the physical-mental distinction—the work\nof art would remain mental. In what follows, then, except where\notherwise noted, we shall treat Croce is being agnostic as between\nidealism, physicalism, or dualism (see PPH 227). \n\nThis claim about the ontological status of works of art means that a\nspectator ‘of’ a work of art—a sonata, a poem, a\npainting—is actually creating the work of art in his mind.\nCroce’s main argument for this is the same as, therefore no\nbetter but no worse than, Russell’s argument from the relativity\nof perception to sense-data. The perceived aesthetic qualities of\nanything vary with the states of the perceiver; therefore in speaking\nof the former we are really speaking of the latter (Aes. 106;\nCroce does not, it seems, consider the possibility that certain states\nof the perceiver might be privileged, but it is evident that he would\ndiscount this possibility). \n\nFeeling, for Croce, is necessarily part of any (mental)\nactivity, including bare perception—indeed, feeling is a\nform of mental activity (it is part of his philosophy that there\nis never literally present to consciousness anything passive). We\nare accustomed to thinking of ‘artistic expression’ as\nconcerned with specific emotions that are relatively rare in the mental\nlife, but again, Croce points out that strictly speaking, we are\nthinking of a quantitative distinction as qualitative. In fact\nfeeling is nothing but the will in mental activity, with all its\nvarieties of thought, desire and action, its varieties of frustration\nand satisfaction (Aes. 74–6). The only criterion of\n‘art’ is coherence of expression, that is, of the movement\nof the will. \n\nBecause of this, Croce discounts certain aesthetic applications of\nthe distinction between form and content as confused. The\ndistinction only applies at a theoretical level, to a posited a\npriori synthesis (EA 39–40). At that level, the\nirruption of an intuition just is the emergence of a form (we\nare right to speak of the formation of intuition, that\nintuitions are formed). At the aesthetic level—one\nmight say at the phenomenological level—there is no\nidentification of content independently of the forms in which we meet\nit, and none of form independently of content. It makes no sense to\nspeak of a work of art’s being good on form but poor on content, or\ngood on content but poor on\nform. \n\nWhen Croce says that intuition and expression are the same\nphenomenon, we are likely to think: what does this mean for a person\nwho cannot draw or paint, for example? Even if we allow Croce his widened\nnotion of feeling, surely the distinction between a man who looks at a\nbowl of fruit but cannot draw or paint it, and the man who does draw or\npaint it, is precisely that of a man with a Crocean intuition but\nwho cannot express it, and one who has both. \n\nCroce comes at this concern from both sides. On one side,\nthere is ‘the illusion or prejudice that we possess a more\ncomplete intuition of reality than we really do’ (Aes.\n9). We have, most of the time, only fleeting, transitory\nintuitions amidst the bustle of our practical lives. ‘The\nworld which as rule we intuite is a small thing’, he writes;\n‘It consists of small expressions … it is a medley of\nlight and colour’ (Aes. 9). On the other side, if our\nman is seriously focussed on the bowl of fruit, it is only a prejudice\nto deny that then he is to that extent expressing\nhimself—although, according to Croce, ordinary direct perception\nof things, as glimpsed in photography, will generally be lacking the\n‘lyrical’ quality that genuine artists give to their\nworks. \n\nThere is another respect in which Croce’s notion of expression\nas intuition departs from what we ordinarily think of in connection with\nthe word ‘expression’. For example we think\nunreflectively of wailing as a natural expression of pain or grief;\ngenerally, we think of expressive behaviour or gestures as being\ncaused, at least paradigmatically, by the underlying emotion or\nfeelings. But Croce joins a long line of aestheticians in\nattempting a sharp distinction between this phenomenon and expression\nin art. Whereas the latter is the subject of aesthetics, the\nformer is a topic for the natural sciences; ‘for instance in\nDarwin’s enquiries into the expression of feeling in man and in\nthe animals’ (PPH 265; cf. Aes. 21,\n94–7). In an article he wrote for the Encyclopaedia\nBritannica, speaking of such ‘psychophysical\nphenomena’, he writes: \n\nCroce is no doubt right to want to distinguish these things, but\nwhether his official position—that expression is identical to\nintuition—will let him do so is another matter; he does not\nactually analyze the phenomena in such a way as to deduce, with the\nhelp of his account of expression, the result. He simply asserts\nit. But we will wait for our final section to articulate\ncriticisms. \n\nCroce’s wish to divorce artistic expression from natural\nexpression is partly driven by his horror at naturalistic theories of\nart. The same goes for his refusal to rank pleasure\nas the aim, or at least an aim, of art (Aes.\n82–6). He does not of course deny that aesthetic pleasures (and\npains) exist, but they are ‘the practical echo of aesthetic value\nand disvalue’ (Aes. 94). Strictly speaking, they are\ndealt with in the Philosophy of the Practical, that is, in the theory\nof the will, and do not enter into the theory of art. That is, if\nthe defining value of the Aesthetic is beauty, the defining\nvalue of the Practical is usefulness. In the\nEssence of Aesthetic (EA 11–13) Croce points\nout that the pleasure is much wider than the domain of art, so a\ndefinition of art as ‘what causes pleasure’ will not\ndo. Croce does speak of the ‘truly aesthetic pleasure’ had\nin beholding the ‘aesthetic fact’ (Aes. 80). But\nperhaps he is being consistent. The pragmatic pleasure had in\nbeholding beauty is only contingently aroused, but in point of fact it\nalways is aroused by such beholding, because the having of an\nintuition is an act of mind, and therefore the will is brought into\nplay. \n\nThe painting of pictures, the scrape of the bow upon strings, the\nchanting or inscription of a poem are, for Croce, only contingently\nrelated to the work of art, that is, to the expressed intuition.\nBy this Croce does not mean to say that for example the painter could\nget by without paint in point of fact; nevertheless what he is\ndoing is always driven by the intuition, and thereby making it possible\nfor others to have the intuition (or rather, an intuition).\nFirst, the memory—though only contingently—often requires\nthe physical work to sustain or develop the intuition. Second,\nthe physical work is necessary for the practical business of the\ncommunication of the intuition. \n\nFor example the process of painting is a closely interwoven\noperation of positive feedback between the intuitive faculty and the\npractical or technical capacity to manipulate the brush, mix paint and\nso on: \n\nHe also defines technique as ‘knowledge at the service of the\npractical activity directed to producing stimuli to aesthetic\nreproduction’ (Aes. 111). Again, we defer\ncriticism to the conclusion. \n\nThe first task of the spectator of the work of art—the\ncritic—is for Croce simple: one is to reproduce the intuition, or\nperhaps better, one is to realize the intuition, which is the\nwork of art. One may fail, and Croce is well aware that one may\nbe mistaken; ‘haste, vanity, want of reflexion,\ntheoretic prejudices’ may bring it about that one finds beautiful\nwhat is not, or fail to find beautiful what is (Aes.\n120). But given the foregoing strict distinction between\npractical technique and artistic activity properly so-called, his task\nis the same as that of the artist: \n\nLeave aside the remark that we become identical with the poet.\nIf by taste we mean the capacity for aesthetic judgement—that is,\nthe capacity to find beauty—and by genius we mean the capacity to\nproduce beauty, then they are the same: the capacity to realize\nintuitions. \n\nIn Croce’s overall philosophy, the aesthetic stands alone: in\nhaving an intuition, one has succeeded entirely insofar as aesthetic\nvalue is concerned. Therefore there cannot be a real question of\na ‘standard’ of beauty which an object might or might not\nsatisfy. Thus Croce says: \n\nOf course there is as a matter of fact a great deal of variability\nin critical verdicts. But Croce believes this is largely due to\nvariances in the ‘psychological conditions’ and the\nphysical circumstance of spectators (Aes. 124). Much of\nthis can be offset by ‘historical interpretation’\n(Aes. 126); the rest, one presumes, are due to\ndisturbances already mentioned: ‘haste, vanity, want of\nreflexion, theoretic prejudices’ (Aes. 120). \n\nThe title of the first great book of Croce’s career was\n‘Aesthetic as a Science of expression and general\nlinguistic’ (emphasis added). There are several\ninterconnected aspects to this. \n\nCroce claims that drawing, sculpting, writing of music and so on are\njust as much ‘language’ as poetry, and all\nlanguage is poetic; therefore ‘Philosophy of language and\nphilosophy of art are the same thing’ (Aes. 142;\nauthor’s emphasis). The reason for this is that language is\nto be understood as expressive; ‘an emission of sounds which\nexpresses nothing is not language’ (Aes. 143). From our\nperspective, we might regard Croce as arguing thus: (1) Referential\nsemantics—scarcely mentioned by Croce—necessarily involves\nparts of speech. (2) However: \n\nIf we take this as asserting the primacy of sentence\nmeaning—glossing over the anti-abstraction remark which is\ntantamount to a denial of syntactic compositionality—then\ntogether with (3) a denial of what in modern terms would be distinction\nbetween semantic and expressive meaning, or perhaps in Fregean terms\nsense and tone, then it is not obvious that the resulting picture of\nlanguage would not apply equally to, for example, drawing. In that\ncase, just as drawings cannot be translated, so linguistic translation\nis impossible (though for certain purposes, naturally, we can translate\n‘relatively’; Aes. 68). \n\nInterestingly, Croce does not think of all signs as natural\nsigns, as lightning is a sign of thunder; on the contrary, he thinks of\n‘pictures, poetry and all works of art’ as equally\nconventional—as ‘historically conditioned’\n(Aes. 125; authors emphasis). \n\nThere is no doubt that on this point Croce was inspired by his great\nprecursor, the Neapolitan Giambattista Vico (1668–1744).\nAccording to Croce (Aes. 220–34) Vico was the first to\nrecognise the aesthetic as a self-sufficient and non-conceptual mode of\nknowledge, and famously he held that all language is\nsubstantially poetry. The only serious mistake in this that Croce\nfound was Vico’s belief in an actual historical period when all\nlanguage was poetry; it was the mistake of substituting a concrete\nhistory for ‘ideal history’ (Aes. 232). \n\nAs he became older, there was one aspect of his aesthetics that he\nwas uneasy with. In the Aesthetic of 1901 (Aes.\n82–7, 114), and again in Essence of Aesthetic of 1913\n(EA 13–16) , he had been happy to deduce from\nhis theory that art cannot have an ethical purpose. The only\nvalue in art is beauty. But by 1917, in the essay The\nTotality of Artistic Expression (PPH 261–73), his\nattitude towards the moral content of art is more nuanced. This\nmay have been only a shift of emphasis, or, charitably perhaps,\ndrawing out a previously unnoticed implication: ‘If the\nethical principle is a cosmic [universal] force (as it certainly is)\nand queen of the world, the world of liberty, she reigns in her own\nright, while art, in proportion to the purity with which she re-enacts\nand expresses the motions of reality, is herself perfect’\n(PPH 267). In other words, he still holds that to speak\nof a moral work of art would not impinge upon it aesthetically;\nlikewise to speak of an immoral work, for the values of the\naesthetic and moral domains are absolutely incommensurable. It is\nnot merely an assertion that within the domain of pure\nintuition, the concepts simply don’t apply; that would merely beg\nthe question. He means that a pure work of art cannot be\nsubject to moral praise or blame because the Aesthetic domain exists\nindependently of and prior, in the Philosophy of Spirit, to the\nEthical. \n\nIn the Encyclopaedia article of 1928, Croce asserts positively that\nthe moral sensibility is a necessary condition of the artist: \n\nStill it’s possible to read him as not having changed his view. For\ninstance, Shakespeare could not have been Shakespeare without seeing\ninto the moral heart of man, for morality is the highest domain of\nspirit. But we have to distinguish between the moral\nsensibility—the capacity to perceive and feel moral\nemotions—and the capacity to act morally. Croce’s\nposition is that only the first is relevant to art. \n\nThe early emphasis on beauty is downplayed in subsequent writing in\nfavour of the successful work art as expression, as constituting a\n‘lyrical intuition’. In Essence of\nAesthetic he writes: \n\nCroce still holds that art is intuitive, a-logical or nonconceptual,\nand therefore by ‘it represents a feeling’ he does not mean\nthat our aesthetic mode of engagement involves that concept, and he\ndoes not mean that art is to be understood as symbolic, implying a\nrelation which would require an intellectual act of mind to\napprehend. Both would imply that our mode of aesthetic engagement\nwould be something more, or something other than, the aesthetic, which\nis as always the intuitive capacity. The point is simply that our\nawareness of the form of the intuition in nothing but our awareness of\nthe unifying currents of feeling running through it. It is a\nclaim about what it is that unifies an intuition, distinguishes it from\nthe surrounding, relatively discontinuous or confused intuition.\nThis is, in effect, a claim about the nature of beauty: \n\nGenuinely new in the 1917 essay was Croce’s appealing but\nenigmatic claim that art is in a sense ‘universal’, is\nconcerned with the ‘totality’: \nAnd: \n\nCroce—and undoubtedly the political situation in Italy in 1917\nplayed a role in this—was anxious to assert the importance of\nart for humanity, and his assertion of it is full of feeling. And the\nclaim marks a decisive break from earlier doctrine: form is now linked\nwith universality rather that with particular feelings.  But it is\ndifficult to see beyond such metaphors as ‘impressing upon it\nthe character of totality’ (not even with the help of\nCroce’s Logic). One is reminded of the Kantian dictum\nthat in aesthetics we ‘demand universality’ in our\njudgements, but there are no explicit indications of such. There is\none piece of Crocean philosophy behind it: Since art takes place prior\nto the intellect, so the logical distinction between subject and\npredicate collapses; therefore perhaps at least one barrier is removed\nfrom speaking of the ‘universality of art’. But that does\nnot indicate what, positively, it means. It obvious that there is\nsomething right about speaking of the ‘universal\ncharacter’ of a Beethoven or a Michelangelo as opposed to the\npitiful, narrow little spectacle of this month’s pop band, but\nCroce doesn’t tell us what justifies or explains such talk (various\nothers have reached a similar conclusion; see Orsini p. 214). Still,\nthat doesn’t mean that he had no right to proclaim it, and perhaps not\nto count his readers as agreeing to it. \n\nThere is a lot of Croce’s aesthetics that we have not discussed,\nincluding his criticisms of the discipline of Rhetoric (Aes.\n67–73; PPH 233–35), of the doctrine that there\nare aesthetic differences amongst different kinds of art\n(Aes. 111–17, EA 53–60, PPH\n229–33), of psychological and other naturalistic views of art\n(Aes.87–93; EA 41–7); there is also his\nmagnificent if contentious précis of the history of\naesthetics (Aes. 155–474). But these are points of\nrelative detail; the theory is whole is sufficiently well before us\nnow to conclude by mentioning some general lines of criticism. \n\nThe equation of intuition with expression is not, in end, plausible.\nC. J. Ducasse (1929) put his finger on it. When we look at a vase\nfull of flowers, it does not matter how closely or in what manner we\nattend to it; we do not create a ‘work of art’ unless\nwe draw or paint it. Croce has lost sight of the ordinary sense of\npassively contemplating and doing something; between reading\nand writing, looking and drawing, listening and playing, dancing and\nwatching. Of course all the first members of these pairs involve\na mental action of a kind, and there are important connections\nbetween the first members and the corresponding seconds—perhaps\nin terms of what Berenson calls ideated sensations—but\nthat is not to say that there are not philosophically crucial\ndistinctions between them. \n\nThe equation also defeats the purpose of art criticism or\ninterpretation, and indeed of the very notion of an aesthetic\ncommunity, of an audience. To say that the work of art is\nidentical with the intuition is to say that it is necessarily\nprivate. It is to say, for example, that since one man’s\nintuition of Botticelli’s Venus is necessarily different\nfrom any one else’s, there is no such thing as Botticelli’s\nVenus, understood not as a material painting but as a work of\nart; there is only Botticelli’s-Venus-for-A,\nBotticelli’s-Venus-for-B, and so on. But these intuitions\ncannot be compared, and there is no higher standard; thus they cannot\nbe said to agree or disagree, since any such comparison would be\nlogically impossible (see Tilghman 1971, Ch. 1, for further\ndiscussion; for at attempt at saving Croce, see Schusterman 1983). The\nposition is perhaps not contradictory, but it is exceedingly\nunattractive; it renders art a diversion away from reality, when as\nFreud emphasized—to invoke a figure who is Croce’s opposite in\nalmost every respect— the artist’s struggle with the medium is\nthe attempt to conquer reality. Although Croce disowned this\nconsequence, it’s hard not to conclude that on this view art is a\ndomain of fancy (in the bad sense), without any check upon vanity\n(see Aes. 122 for a point at which Croce almost sees the\npoint). If we bring back the material painted object into the picture,\nof course, then there is no such difficulty: ones\n‘intuition’ will be accurate, or one’s interpretation will\nbe correct, just in case it corresponds to the picture (of course the\nnotion of ‘corresponds to the picture’ is only a\nplaceholder for a great deal to be supplied by theories of\nrepresentation, perspective, expression and other parts of aesthetics;\nbut the one thing that plausible theories will share is a commitment\nto the object, the material painting). \n\nIt’s worth emphasizing again that Croce’s claim that\nintuition is expression, and consequently that works art are mental\nobjects, is not just an application of his general idealism. It\nis independent of it. In the Encyclopaedia Britannica\narticle, for example, he allows himself to speak for convenience of the\n‘spiritual’ and ‘physical’, in order to make\nthe point that the physical object is only of practical, and not of\naesthetic significance (PPH 227–8). \n\nUndoubtedly Croce was influenced by his lifelong immersion in\nliterature in his proclamation that all language is poetry. And\nperhaps it is true that all language has some poetic qualities, and\nperhaps it is true that language ‘in its actuality’\nconsists of sentential utterances. But as Bosanquet pointed out\nin 1919, this does not mean that language is only poetry, or\nthat the referential dimension of language does not exist. It\nmust have something that distinguishes a scientific treatise from a\ntune—in fact it must be that the same thing, which we are calling\nthe referential dimension, that serves to distinguish poetry\nfrom a tune (it has to have sound and sense, as we say).\nSo to say that drawings and tunes are equally good examples of language\nseems, at best, strained. Croce would have no doubt said\nthat the referential dimension does not exist, or is a false\nabstraction; but his general philosophical views may be forcing\nhim down an unprepossessing path. More promising would be a\nformalist endeavor to try to isolate the pure sonic aspect of\npoetry—comprising metre, alliteration and so on—and then to\nsearch for instantiations or at least analogies in the other\narts. \n\nSuppose Croce were to give up the idea that art is\nintuition, and agree that the work of art is identical with the\nmaterial work—remember this would not prevent him being an\nidealist in his general philosophy—and suppose he allowed that he\nwas wrong about language. What would remain of his theory would\narguably be its essence: that art is expression that we engage\nwith via the intuitive capacity. \n\nIn closing, the reader may find it useful if we summarize the major\ndifferences—narrowly on matters of aesthetics—between\nCroce and Collingwood, who is often thought of as Croce’s\nfollower (see Hospers 1956 and especially Peters 2011 for\nmore). First, whereas Croce’s theory does not tend to regard the\nexpressive content of work of art as something ‘in the\nartist’, emphasizing instead its form and later its\n‘universality’, Collingwood tries to explain expressive\ncontent in terms of a detailed theory of the emotions. Second,\nalthough Croce does devote some energy to discrediting the\n‘technical’ theory of art, Collingwood offers a more\norganized and detailed analysis of why art is not ‘craft’,\nthough arguably the main points are Croce’s. Finally,\nCollingwood devotes his final sections to a topic left unaddressed by\nCroce: the problem of whether or in what way the responses of the\naudience can constrain the object presented by the artist.","contact.mail":"gary.kemp@glasgow.ac.uk","contact.domain":"glasgow.ac.uk"}]
