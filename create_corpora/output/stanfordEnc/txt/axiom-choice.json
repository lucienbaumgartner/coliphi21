The fulsomeness of this description might lead those\nunfamiliar with the axiom to expect it to be as startling as, say, the\nPrinciple of the Constancy of the Velocity of Light or the Heisenberg\nUncertainty Principle. But in fact the Axiom of Choice as it is\nusually stated appears humdrum, even self-evident. For it amounts to\nnothing more than the claim that, given any collection of mutually\ndisjoint nonempty sets, it is possible to assemble a new set—a\ntransversal or choice set—containing exactly\none element from each member of the given collection. Nevertheless,\nthis seemingly innocuous principle has far-reaching mathematical\nconsequences—many indispensable, some startling—and\nhas come to figure prominently in discussions on the foundations of\nmathematics. It (or its equivalents) have been employed in countless\nmathematical papers, and a number of monographs have been exclusively\ndevoted to it.\n\n\n\nIn 1904 Ernst Zermelo formulated the Axiom of Choice (abbreviated as\nAC throughout this article) in terms of what he called\ncoverings (Zermelo 1904).  He starts with an arbitrary set\n\\(M\\) and uses the symbol \\(M'\\) to denote an\narbitrary nonempty subset of \\(M\\), the collection of which he\ndenotes by M.  He continues: \n\nThe last sentence of this quotation—which asserts, in effect,\nthat coverings always exist for the collection of nonempty subsets of\nany (nonempty) set—is Zermelo’s first formulation of\nthe Axiom of \n Choice[1].\n This is now usually stated in terms of choice functions:\nhere a choice function on a collection \\(\\sH\\)\n  of nonempty sets is a map \\(f\\) with domain \n \\(\\sH\\)\n  such that \\(f(X) \\in X\\) for every \\(X \\in \\sH\\).  \nAs a very simple example, let \\(\\sH\\)\nbe the collection of nonempty subsets of \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\), i.e., \n\\(\\sH = \\{\\{0\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{0,1\\}\\}\\). Then \n\\(\\sH\\) has the two distinct choice functions\n\\(f_{1}\\) and \\(f_{2}\\) given by: \n  A more interesting example of a choice function is provided by\ntaking \\(\\sH\\)\nto be the set of (unordered) pairs of real numbers and the function\nto be that assigning to each pair its least element. A different choice\nfunction is obtained by assigning to each pair its greatest\nelement. Clearly many more choice functions on\n\\(\\sH\\) can be defined. \n  Stated in terms of choice functions, Zermelo’s first formulation of\nAC reads: \nAC1: \nAny collection of nonempty sets has a choice function.\n \n\nAC1 can be reformulated in terms of indexed\nor variable sets. An indexed collection of sets\n \\(\\sA = \\{A_{i}: i \\in I\\}\\)\n may be conceived as a variable set, to wit, as a set\nvarying over the index set \\(I\\). Each\n\\(A_{i}\\) is then the “value” of the\nvariable set \\(\\sA\\)\nat stage \\(i\\). A choice function on\n\\(\\sA\\) is a map \\(f: I \\rightarrow \\bigcup_{i\\in I} A_{i}\\) such that \n\\(f(i) \\in A_{i}\\) for all \\(i\\in I\\).  A choice function on\n\\(\\sA\\) is thus a “choice” of an element of the variable set\n\\(\\sA\\) at each stage; in other words, a choice function on\n\\(\\sA\\) is a variable element of \\(\\sA\\). \nAC1 is then equivalent to the assertion \nAC2: \n Any indexed collection of  sets has a choice function.\n \n\nInformally speaking, AC2 amounts to the assertion\nthat a variable set with an element at each stage has a variable\nelement. \n\nAC1 can also be reformulated in terms of\nrelations, viz. \nAC3: \n For any relation \\(R\\) between sets \\(A\\), \\(B\\),\n \n  In other words, every relation contains a function having the same\ndomain. \n\nFinally AC3  is easily shown to be equivalent\n(in the usual set theories) \n to:[2] \nAC4: \n Any surjective function has a right inverse.\n \n\nIn a 1908 paper Zermelo introduced a modified form of AC. Let\nus call a transversal (or choice set) for a family\nof sets \\(\\sH\\) any subset \n\\(T \\subseteq \\bigcup \\sH\\)\n for which each intersection \\(T \\cap X\\) for\n\\(X \\in \\sH\\)\nhas exactly one element.  As a very simple example, let \n\\(\\sH = \\{\\{0\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{2, 3\\}\\}\\). Then \n\\(\\sH\\)\nhas the two transversals \\(\\{0, 1, 2\\}\\) and \\(\\{0, 1, 3\\}\\). \nA more substantial example is afforded  by letting\n\\(\\sH\\) be the collection of all lines in the Euclidean plane parallel to the\n\\(x\\)-axis. Then the set \\(T\\) of points on the \\(y\\)-axis is a\ntransversal for \\(\\sH\\). \nStated in terms of transversals, then, Zermelo’s second (1908)\nformulation of AC amounts to the assertion that any family of\nmutually disjoint nonempty sets has a\n transversal.[3] \n Zermelo asserts that “the purely objective character” of\nthis principle “is immediately evident.” In making this\nassertion Zermelo meant to emphasize the fact that in this form the\nprinciple makes no appeal to the possibility of making\n“choices”. It may also be that Zermelo had the following\n“combinatorial” justification of the principle in\nmind. Given a family \\(\\sH\\) of mutually disjoint nonempty sets, call\na subset \\(S \\subseteq \\bigcup \\sH\\) a selector for \\(\\sH\\)\nif \\(S\\cap X \\ne \\varnothing\\) for all \\(X \\in \\sH\\). Clearly\nselectors for \\(\\sH\\) exist; \\(\\bigcup \\sH\\) itself is an example. Now\none can imagine taking a selector \\(S\\) for \\(\\sH\\) and\n“thinning out” each intersection \\(S \\cap X\\) for \\(X\\in\n\\sH\\) until it contains just a single element. The result is a\ntransversal for \\(\\sH\\). This argument, suitably refined, yields a\nprecise derivation of\nAC in this formulation from the set-theoretical\nprinciple known as Zorn’s lemma (see below).  \n Let us call Zermelo’s 1908 formulation the combinatorial\n axiom of choice:  \nCAC: \n Any collection of mutually disjoint nonempty sets has a\ntransversal.\n \n It is to be noted that AC1 and CAC\nfor finite collections of sets are both provable (by\ninduction) in the usual set theories. But in the case of an\ninfinite collection, even when each of its members is finite,\nthe question of the existence of a choice function or a transversal is\n problematic[4].\n For example, as already mentioned, it is easy to come up with a\nchoice function for the collection of pairs of real numbers (simply\nchoose the smaller element of each pair). But it is by no means\nobvious how to produce a choice function for the collection of pairs\nof arbitrary sets of real numbers. \n Zermelo’s original purpose in introducing AC was to\nestablish a central principle of Cantor’s set theory, namely, that\nevery set admits a well-ordering and so can also be assigned a\ncardinal number. Zermelo’s 1904 introduction of the axiom, as well as\nthe use to which he put it, provoked considerable criticism from the\nmathematicians of the day.  The chief objection raised was to what\nsome saw as its highly non-constructive, even idealist, character:\nwhile the axiom asserts the possibility of making a number \nof—perhaps even an uncountable number—of arbitrary\n“choices”, it gives no indication whatsoever of how these\nlatter are actually to be effected, of how, otherwise put, choice\nfunctions are to be defined. This was particularly\nobjectionable to mathematicians of a “constructive” bent\nsuch as the so-called French Empiricists Baire, Borel and Lebesgue,\nfor whom a mathematical object could be asserted to exist only if it\ncan be defined in such a way as to characterize it uniquely.\nZermelo’s response to his critics came in the form in two papers in\n1908. In the first of these, as remarked above, he\nreformulated AC in terms of transversals; in the second\n(1908a) he made explicit the further assumptions needed to carry\nthrough his proof of the well-ordering theorem. These assumptions\nconstituted the first explicit presentation of an axiom system for set\ntheory. \n As the debate concerning the Axiom of Choice rumbled on, it became\napparent that the proofs of a number of significant mathematical\ntheorems made essential use of it, thereby leading many mathematicians\nto treat it as an indispensable tool of their trade.  Hilbert, for\nexample, came to regard AC as an essential principle of\nmathematics[5] and\nemployed it in his defence of classical mathematical reasoning against\nthe attacks of the intuitionists.  Indeed his ε-operators are\nessentially just choice functions (see the entry on the\n  epsilon calculus). \n Although the usefulness of AC quickly become clear,\ndoubts about its soundness remained. These doubts were reinforced by\nthe fact that it had certain strikingly counterintuitive\nconsequences.  The most spectacular of these was Banach\nand Tarski’s paradoxical decompositions of the sphere\n(Banach and Tarski 1924): any solid sphere can be split into finitely\nmany pieces which can be reassembled to form two solid spheres of the\nsame size; and any solid sphere can be split into finitely many\npieces in such a way as to enable them to be reassembled to form a\nsolid sphere of arbitrary size. (See Wagon 1993.)  \n It was not until the middle 1930s that the question of the soundness\nof AC was finally put to rest with Kurt Gödel’s\nproof of its consistency relative to the other axioms of set theory.\n \n Here is a brief chronology of\n AC:[6] \n\nAs stated above, in 1922 Fraenkel proved the independence of\nAC from a system of set theory containing\n“atoms”. Here by an atom is meant a pure\nindividual, that is, an entity having no members and yet distinct from\nthe empty set (so a fortiori an atom cannot be a set). In a\nsystem of set theory with atoms it is assumed that one is given an\ninfinite set \\(A\\) of atoms. One can build a\nuniverse \\(V(A)\\) of sets over \\(A\\) by starting\nwith \\(A\\), adding all the subsets of \\(A\\), adjoining all\nthe subsets of the result, etc., and iterating\ntransfinitely.  \\(V(A)\\) is then a model of set theory\nwith atoms. The kernel of Fraenkel’s method for proving the\nindependence of AC is the observation that, since atoms\ncannot be set-theoretically distinguished, any permutation of the set\n\\(A\\) of atoms induces a structure-preserving \npermutation—an automorphism—of the universe\n\\(V(A)\\) of sets built from \\(A\\). This idea may be\nused to construct another model \\(Sym(V)\\) of \nset theory—a permutation or symmetric model—in\nwhich a set of mutually disjoint pairs of elements of \\(A\\) has\nno choice function.   \n           \nNow let us suppose that we are given a group \\(G\\) of\nautomorphisms of \\(A\\). Let us say that an automorphism \\(\\pi\\); of\n\\(A\\) fixes an element \\(x\\) of\n\\(V(A)\\) if \\(\\pi(x) = x\\). Clearly, if\n\\(\\pi \\in G\\) fixes every element of \\(A\\), it also\nfixes every element of \\(V(A)\\). Now it may be the case\nthat, for certain elements \\(x \\in V(A)\\),\nthe fixing of the elements of a subset of \\(A\\) by any\n\\(\\pi\\in G\\) suffices to fix \\(x\\). We are therefore\nled to define a support for \\(x\\) to be a subset\n\\(X\\) of \\(A\\) such that, whenever \\(\\pi\\in G\\)\nfixes each member of \\(X\\), it also fixes \\(x\\). Members of\n\\(V(A)\\) possessing a finite support are called\nsymmetric. \n\nWe next define the universe \\(Sym(V)\\) to consist of the\nhereditarily symmetric members of \\(V(A)\\),\nthat is, those \\(x\\in V(A)\\) such that\n\\(x\\), the elements of \\(x\\), the elements of elements of\n\\(x\\), etc., are all symmetric. \\(Sym(V)\\) is also\na model of set theory with set of atoms \\(A\\), and \\(\\pi\\) induces\nan automorphism of \\(Sym(V)\\). \n           \nNow suppose \\(A\\) to be partitioned into a (necessarily infinite)\nmutually disjoint set \\(P\\) of pairs. Take \\(G\\) to be the group of\npermutations of \\(A\\) which fix all the pairs in \\(P\\). Then \\(P\\in\nSym(V)\\); it can now be shown that \\(Sym(V)\\) contains no choice\nfunction on \\(P\\). For suppose \\(f\\) were a choice function on \\(P\\)\nand \\(f \\in Sym(V)\\). Then \\(f\\) has a finite support which may be\ntaken to be of the form \\(\\{a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}, b_{1},\\ldots,b_{n}\\}\nwith each pair \\{a_{i}, b_{i}\\} \\in P\\). Since \\(P\\) is infinite, we\nmay select a pair \\(\\{c, d\\} = U\\) from \\(P\\) different from all the\n\\(\\{a_{i}, b_{i}\\}\\). Now we define \\(\\pi \\in G\\) so that \\(\\pi\\)\nfixes each \\(a_{i}\\) and \\(b_{i}\\) and interchanges \\(c\\) and\n\\(d\\). Then \\(\\pi\\) also fixes \\(f\\). Since \\(f\\) was supposed to be a\nchoice function on \\(P\\), and \\(U \\in P\\), we must have \\(f(U) \\in\nU\\), that is, \\(f(U) = c\\) or \\(f(U) = d\\). Since \\(\\pi\\) interchanges\n\\(c\\) and \\(d\\), it follows that \\(\\pi(f(U)) \\ne f(U)\\). But since\n\\(\\pi\\) is an automorphism, it also preserves function application, so\nthat \\(\\pi(f(U)) = \\pi f(\\pi(U))\\). But\n\\(\\pi(U) = U\\) and \\(\\pi f = f\\), whence\n\\(\\pi(f(U)) = f(U)\\). We have duly arrived at a contradiction,\nshowing that the universe \\(Sym(V)\\) contains no choice\nfunction on \\(P\\). \n\nThe point here is that for a symmetric function \\(f\\) defined on\n\\(P\\) there is a finite list \\(L\\) of pairs from \\(P\\)\nthe fixing of all of whose elements suffices to fix \\(f\\), and\nhence also all the values of \\(f\\). Now, for any pair \\(U\\)\nin \\(P\\) but not in \\(L\\) , a permutation \\(\\pi\\) can always be\nfound which fixes all the elements of the pairs in \\(L\\), but\ndoes not fix the members of \\(U\\). Since \\(\\pi\\) must fix the value\nof \\(f\\) at \\(U\\), that value cannot lie in \\(U\\).\nTherefore \\(f\\) cannot “choose” an element of\n\\(U\\), so a fortiori \\(f\\) cannot be a choice function on\n\\(P\\). \n           \nThis argument shows that collections of sets of atoms need\nnot necessarily have choice functions, but it fails to establish the\nsame fact for the “usual” sets of mathematics, for example\nthe set of real numbers. This had to wait until 1963 when Paul Cohen\nshowed that it is consistent with the standard axioms of set theory\n(which preclude the existence of atoms) to assume that a countable\ncollection of pairs of sets of real numbers fails to have a choice\nfunction. The core of Cohen’s method of proof—the celebrated\nmethod of forcing—was vastly more general than any\nprevious technique; nevertheless his independence proof also made\nessential use of permutation and symmetry in essentially the form in\nwhich Fraenkel had originally employed them. \n           \nGödel’s proof of the relative consistency of AC \nwith the axioms of set theory (see the entry on \n Kurt Gödel)\n rests on an entirely different idea: that of\ndefinability. He introduced a new hierarchy of \nsets—the constructible hierarchy—by analogy with the\ncumulative type hierarchy. We recall that the latter is defined by the\nfollowing recursion on the ordinals, where \\(\\sP(X)\\) is\nthe power set of \\(X\\), \\(\\alpha\\) is an ordinal, and \\(\\lambda\\) is\na limit ordinal:: \n\nThe constructible hierarchy is defined by a similar recursion on the\nordinals, where \\(\\Def(X)\\) is the set of all subsets of\n\\(X\\) which are first-order definable in the structure\n\\((X, \\in, (x)_{x\\in X})\\):[7] \n\nThe constructible universe is the class \n\\(L = \\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in \\Ord} L_{\\alpha}\\); the members of \\(L\\) are the\nconstructible sets. Gödel showed that (assuming the\naxioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ZF) the\nstructure \\((L, \\in)\\) is a model of ZF and\nalso of AC as well as the Generalized Continuum\nHypothesis). The relative consistency of AC with\nZF follows.   \n\nIt was also observed by Gödel (1964) (and, independently, by\nMyhill and Scott 1971, Takeuti 1963 and Post 1951) that a simpler\nproof of the relative consistency of AC can be\nformulated in terms of ordinal definability. If we write\n\\(\\rD(X)\\) for the set of all subsets of \\(X\\) which are\nfirst-order definable in the structure \\((X, \\in)\\), then the\nclass OD of ordinal definable sets is defined to be the\nunion \\(\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in \\Ord}  D(V_{\\alpha})\\).\n The class HOD of hereditarily ordinal definable sets\nconsists of all sets \\(a\\) for which \\(a\\), the members of\n\\(a\\), the members of members of \\(a\\), … etc., are\nall ordinal definable. It can then be shown that the structure (HOD,\n\\(\\in\\)) is a model of ZF + AC , from\nwhich the relative consistency of AC  with\nZF again\n follows.[8] \n\nThe Axiom of Choice is closely allied to a group of mathematical\npropositions collectively known as maximal principles.\nBroadly speaking, these propositions assert that certain conditions\nare sufficient to ensure that a partially ordered set contains at\nleast one maximal element, that is, an element such that,\nwith respect to the given partial ordering, no element strictly\nexceeds it. \n\n           \nTo see the connection between the idea of a maximal element and\nAC, let us return to the latter’s formulation\nAC2 in terms of indexed sets. Accordingly suppose we\nare given an indexed family of nonempty sets \\(\\sA = \\{A_{i}:i \\in\nI\\}.\\) Let us define a potential choice function on \\(\\sA\\)\nto be a function \\(f\\) whose domain is a subset of \\(I\\) such that\n\\(f(i) \\in A_{i}\\) for all \\(i\\in J\\).  (Here the use of the\nqualifier potential is suggested by the fact that the domain\nis a subset of \\(I\\); recall that a choice function \\(f\\) on \\(\\sA\\)\nhas the same properties as what we are now calling potential choice\nfunctions except that the domain of \\(f\\) is required to be all of\n\\(I\\), not just a subset.) The set \\(P\\) of potential choice functions\non \\(\\sA\\) can be partially ordered by inclusion: we agree that, for\npotential choice functions \\(f, g \\in P\\), the relation \\(f \\le g\\)\nholds provided that the domain of \\(f\\) is included in that of \\(g\\)\nand the value of \\(f\\) at an element of its domain coincides with the\nvalue of \\(g\\) there. It is now easy to see that the maximal elements\nof \\(P\\) with respect to the partial ordering \\(\\le\\) are precisely\nthe choice functions on \\(\\sA\\).  \n Zorn’s Lemma is the best-known principle ensuring the\nexistence of such maximal elements.  To state it, we need a few\ndefinitions. Given a partially ordered set \\((P, \\le)\\), an\nupper bound for a subset \\(X\\) of \\(P\\) is an element \\(a\\in\nP\\) for which \\(x\\le a\\) for every \\(x\\in X\\); a maximal\nelement of \\(P\\) may then be defined as an element \\(a\\) for\nwhich the set of upper bounds of \\(\\{a\\}\\) coincides with \\(\\{a\\}\\),\nwhich essentially means that no element of \\(P\\) is strictly larger\nthan \\(a\\). A chain in \\((P,\\le)\\) is a subset \\(C\\) of \\(P\\)\nsuch that, for any \\(x\\), \\(y\\in P\\), either \\(x\\le y\\) or \\(y\\le x\\). \n\\(P\\) is said to be inductive if every chain in \\(P\\)\nhas an upper bound. Now Zorn’s Lemma asserts: \n Zorn’s Lemma (ZL): \n Every nonempty inductive\npartially ordered set has a maximal element.\n\n \n           \nWhy is Zorn’s Lemma plausible? Here is an informal argument.\nGiven a nonempty inductive partially ordered set \\((P,\\le)\\), pick an\narbitrary element \\(p_{0}\\) of \\(P\\). If \\(p_{0}\\) is maximal, stop\nthere. Otherwise pick an element \\(p_{1} \\gt p_{0}\\); if \\(p_{1}\\) is\nmaximal, stop there. Otherwise pick an element \\(p_{2} \\gt p_{1}\\),\nand repeat the process. If none of the elements \\(p_{0} \\lt p_{1} \\lt\np_{2} \\lt \\ldots \\lt p_{n} \\lt \\ldots\\) is maximal, the \\(p_{i}\\) form\na chain which, since \\(P\\) is inductive, has an upper bound\n\\(q_{0}\\). If \\(q_{0}\\) is maximal, stop there. Otherwise the\nprocedure can be repeated with \\(q_{0} \\lt q_{1}\\), …, and then\niterated. This process must eventually terminate, since otherwise the\nunion of the chains so generated would constitute a proper class,\nmaking \\(P\\) itself a proper class contrary to assumption. The\npoint at which the process terminates yields a maximal element\nof \\(P\\). \n This argument, suitably rigorized, gives a\n proof[9]\n of ZL from AC1 in Zermelo-Fraenkel\nset theory: in this proof AC1 is used to\n“pick” the elements referred to in the informal\nargument. \n           \nAnother version of Zorn’s Lemma can be given in terms of\ncollections of sets. Given a collection \\(\\sH\\) of sets, let us call\na nest in \\(\\sH\\) any subcollection \\(\\sN\\) of \\(\\sH\\) such\nthat, for any pair of members of \\(\\sN\\), one is included in the\n other.[10] \nCall \\(\\sH\\) strongly inductive if the union of any nest in\n\\(\\sH\\) is a member of \\(\\sH\\).  Zorn’s Lemma may then be\nequivalently restated as the assertion that any nonempty strongly\ninductive collection \\(\\sH\\) of sets has a maximal member, that is, a\nmember properly included in no member of \\(\\sH\\).  This may in turn be\nformulated in a dual form. Call a family of sets\nstrongly reductive if it is closed under intersections of\nnests. Then any nonempty strongly reductive family of sets has a\nminimal element, that is, a member properly including no\nmember of the family. \n           \nAC2 is now easily derived from Zorn’s Lemma in\nthis alternative form. For the set \\(P\\) of potential choice functions\non an indexed family of sets \\(\\sA\\) is clearly nonempty and is\nreadily shown to be strongly inductive; so Zorn’s lemma yields\nthe existence of a choice function on \\(\\sA\\).  \n           \nCAC can be derived from\nZL in a way echoing the “combinatorial”\njustification of CAC sketched above. Accordingly\nsuppose we are given a family \\(\\sH\\) of mutually disjoint nonempty\nsets; call a subset \\(S \\subseteq \\bigcup \\sH\\) a sampling\nfor \\(\\sH\\) if, for any \\(X\\in \\sH\\), either \n\\(X \\subseteq S\\) or \\(S \\cap X\\) is nonempty and\nfinite. Minimal samplings are precisely transversals for\n \\(\\sH\\);[11] \nand the collection \\(\\sT\\) of samplings is clearly nonempty since it\ncontains \\(\\bigcup \\sH\\).  So if it can be shown that \\(\\sT\\) is\nstrongly \n reductive,[12] \n Zorn’s lemma will yield a minimal element of \\(\\sT\\) and so a\ntransversal for \\(\\sH\\).  The strong reductiveness of \\(\\sT\\) may be\nseen as follows: suppose that \\(\\{S_{i}: i\\in I\\}\\) is a nest of\nsamplings; let \\(S = {\\bigcap}_{i\\in I} S_{i}\\).  We need to show that\n\\(S\\) is itself a sampling; to this end let \\(X \\in \\sH\\) and suppose\n\\(\\neg(X \\subseteq S)\\). Then there is \\(i \\in I\\) for which \n\\(\\neg(X \\subseteq S_{i})\\); since \\(S_{i}\\) is a sampling, \\(S_{i}\\cap X\\) is\nfinite and nonempty,\nsay \\(S_{i}\\cap X = \\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}\\). Clearly \n\\(S\\cap X\\) is then finite; suppose for the sake of contradiction that\n\\(S\\cap X = \\varnothing\\). Then for each \\(k = 1,\\ldots,n\\) there is \n\\(i_k \\in I\\) for which \\(\\neg(x_k \\in S_{i_k})\\). It follows that\n\\(\\neg(S_{i} \\subseteq S_{i_k})\\), for \\(k = 1, \\ldots, n\\).  \nSo, since the \\(S_{i}\\) form a chain, each \\(S_{i_k}\\) is a subset of\n\\(S_{i}\\). Let \\(S_{j}\\) be the least of \\(S_{i_1},\\ldots, S_{i_k}\\);\nthen \\(S_{j}\\subseteq S_{i}\\). But since \\(\\neg(x_{k} \\in S_{j})\\),\nfor \\(k = 1, \\ldots, n\\), it now follows that \\(S_{j} \\cap X =\n\\varnothing\\), contradicting the fact that \\(S_{j}\\) is a sampling.\nTherefore \\(S \\cap X\\ne \\varnothing\\); and \\(S\\) is a sampling as\nclaimed. \n           \nWe note that while Zorn’s lemma and the Axiom of Choice are\nset-theoretically equivalent, it is much more difficult to derive the\nformer from the latter than vice-versa. \n           \nHere is a brief chronology of maximal principles. \n\nThe Axiom of Choice has numerous applications in mathematics, a\nnumber of which have proved to be formally equivalent to\n it[13].\n Historically the most important application was the first, namely: \nThe Well-Ordering Theorem (Zermelo 1904,\n1908). Every set can be well-ordered.  \n \nAfter Zermelo published his 1904 proof of the well-ordering theorem\nfrom AC, it was quickly seen that the two are equivalent.\n \n\nAnother early equivalent of AC is \nThe Multiplicative Axiom (Russell 1906). The\nproduct of any set of non-zero cardinal numbers is non-zero.\n \n\nEarly applications of AC include: \n\nA significant “folklore” equivalent of AC is \nThe Set-Theoretic Distributive Law. For an\narbitrary doubly-indexed family of sets\n\\(\\{M_{i,j}: i \\in I,j \\in J\\}\\), and where\n\\(J^I\\) is the set of all functions with\ndomain \\(I\\) and which take values in \\(J\\):\n \n A much-studied special case of AC is the \nPrinciple of Dependent Choices (Bernays 1942, Tarski\n1948). For any nonempty relation \\(R\\) on a set \\(A\\) for which\n\\(\\range(R) \\subseteq \\domain(R)\\), there is a function \\(f: \\omega\n\\rightarrow A\\) such that, for all \\(n\\in \\omega, R(f(n),f(n+1))\\).\nThis principle, although (much) weaker than AC, cannot be\nproved without it in the context of the remaining axioms of set\ntheory.\n \n Mathematical equivalents of AC include: \n There are a number of mathematical consequences of AC\nwhich are known to be\n weaker[14]\n than it, in particular: \n Finally, there is \n The question of the equivalence of this with AC is one of\nthe few remaining interesting open questions in this area; while it\nclearly implies BPI, it was proved independent of\nBPI in Bell 1983.  Many of these theorems are discussed in Bell and Machover (1977).\n \n\nAn initial connection between AC and logic emerges by\nreturning to its formulation AC3 in terms of\nrelations, namely: any binary relation contains a function with the\nsame domain. This version of AC is naturally\nexpressible within a second-order language \\(L\\) with individual\nvariables \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\), … and function\nvariables \\(f\\), \\(g\\), \\(h\\), …. In \\(L\\),\nbinary relations are represented by formulas\n\\(\\phi(x, y)\\) with two free individual\nvariables \\(x\\), \\(y\\). The counterpart in \\(L\\) of the\nassertion AC3 is then \nThis scheme of sentences is the standard logical form of\nAC. \nZermelo’s original form of the Axiom of Choice,\nAC1, can be expressed as a scheme of sentences within\na suitably strengthened version of \\(L\\). Accordingly we now\nsuppose \\(L\\) to contain in addition predicate\nvariables \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), \\(Z\\), … and\nsecond-order function variables \\(F\\), \\(G\\), \\(H\\),\n…. Here a second-order function variable \\(F\\) may be\napplied to a predicate variable \\(X\\) to yield an individual term\n\\(FX\\).   The scheme of sentences \n is the direct counterpart of AC1 in this\nstrengthened second-order language. In words, AC1L\nasserts that, if each predicate having a certain property\n\\(\\Phi\\) has instances, then there is a function \\(F\\) on\npredicates such that, for any predicate \\(X\\) satisfying\n\\(\\Phi\\), \\(FX\\) is an instance of \\(X\\). Here\npredicates are playing the role of sets. \n Up to now we have tacitly assumed our background logic to be the\nusual classical logic. But the true depth of the connection between\nAC and logic emerges only when\nintuitionistic or constructive logic is brought into\nthe picture. It is a remarkable fact that, assuming only the framework\nof intuitionistic logic together with certain mild further\npresuppositions, the Axiom of Choice can be shown to entail the\ncardinal rule of classical logic, the law of excluded \nmiddle—the assertion that \\(A \\vee \\neg A\\) for any proposition\n\\(A\\). To be precise, using the rules of intuitionistic logic\nwithin our augmented language \\(L\\), we shall\n derive[15]\n the law of excluded middle from AC1L conjoined with\nthe following additional principles: \nPredicative Comprehension:\n\\(\\exists X \\forall x[X(x) \\leftrightarrow \\phi(x)]\\), where \\(\\phi\\)\ncontains no bound function or predicate variables. \nExtensionality of Functions:\n\\(\\forall X \\forall Y \\forall F[X \\approx Y \\rightarrow  FX = FY]\\), where \n\\(X \\approx Y\\) is an abbreviation for\n\\(\\forall x[X(x) \\leftrightarrow Y(x)]\\), that is, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are\nextensionally equivalent. \nTwo Distinct Individuals:\n\\(\\uO \\ne \\uI\\), where \\(\\uO\\) and \\(\\uI\\) are\nindividual constants.\n \n Now let \\(A\\) be a given proposition. By Predicative\nComprehension, we may introduce predicate constants \\(U\\),\n\\(V\\) together with the assertions \n\nLet \\(\\Phi(X)\\) be the formula \\(X \\approx U \\vee X \\approx V\\). Then\nclearly we may assert \\(\\forall X[\\Phi(X) \\rightarrow \\exists xX(x)]\\)\nso AC1L may be invoked to assert \\(\\exists F \\forall\nX[\\Phi(X) \\rightarrow X(FX)]\\). Now we can introduce a function\nconstant \\(K\\) together with the assertion \n\nSince evidently we may assert \\(\\Phi(U)\\) and \\(\\Phi(V)\\), it follows\nfrom (2) that we may assert \\(U(KU)\\) and \\(V(KV)\\), whence also,\nusing (1), \nUsing the distributive law (which holds in intuitionistic logic), it\nfollows that we may assert \nFrom the presupposition that \\(0 \\ne 1\\) it follows that \n is assertable. But it follows from (1) that we may assert \\(A\n\\rightarrow U ≈ V\\), and so also, using the Extensionality of\nFunctions, \\(A \\rightarrow KU = KV\\). This yields the assertability of\n\\(KU \\ne KV \\rightarrow  \\neg A\\),\nwhich, together with (3) in turn yields the assertability of \nthat is, the law of excluded middle. \nThe fact that the Axiom of Choice implies Excluded Middle seems at\nfirst sight to be at variance with the fact that the former is often\ntaken as a valid principle in systems of constructive\nmathematics governed by intuitionistic logic, e.g. Bishop’s\n Constructive Analysis[16] \n and Martin-Löf’s Constructive Type\n Theory[17], in\n which Excluded Middle is not affirmed. In Bishop’s words, “A\nchoice function exists in constructive mathematics because a choice is\nimplied by the very meaning of existence.” Thus, for\nexample, the antecedent \n\\(\\forall x \\exists y \\phi(x,y)\\) of ACL, given a\nconstructive construal, just means that we have a procedure\nwhich, applied to each \\(x\\), yields a \\(y\\) for which\n\\(\\phi(x, y)\\). But this is precisely what is expressed by the\nconsequent \\(\\exists f \\forall x \\phi(x,fx)\\) of ACL. \n To resolve the difficulty, we note that in deriving Excluded Middle\nfrom ACL1 essential use was made of the principles of\nPredicative Comprehension and Extensionality of\n Functions[18]. \n It follows that, in systems of constructive mathematics affirming\nAC (but not Excluded Middle) either the principle\nof Predicative Comprehension or the principle of Extensionality of\nFunctions must fail. While the principle of Predicative\nComprehension can be given a constructive justification, no such\njustification can be provided for the principle of Extensionality of\nFunctions. Functions on predicates are given intensionally, and\nsatisfy just the corresponding principle of Intensionality\n\\(\\forall X \\forall Y \\forall F[X = Y \\rightarrow  FX = FY]\\). The\nprinciple of Extensionality can easily be made to fail by considering,\nfor example, the predicates \\(P\\): rational featherless\nbiped and \\(Q\\): human being and the function\n\\(K\\) on predicates which assigns to each predicate the number of\nwords in its description. Then we can agree that \\(P \\approx\nQ\\) but \\(KP = 3\\) and \\(KQ = 2\\). \n In intuitionistic set theory (that is, set theory based on\nintuitionistic as opposed to classical logic—we shall abbreviate\nthis as IST) and in topos theory the principles of\nPredicative Comprehension and Extensionality of Functions (both\nappropriately construed) hold and so there AC implies\nExcluded\n Middle.[19],[20] \n The derivation of Excluded Middle from AC was first given by\nDiaconescu (1975) in a category-theoretic setting. His proof employed\nessentially different ideas from the proof presented above; in\nparticular, it makes no use of extensionality principles but instead\nemploys the idea of the quotient of an object (or set) by an\nequivalence relation. It is instructive to formulate\nDiaconescu’s argument within IST. To do this,\nlet us call a subset \\(U\\) of a set \\(A\\) detachable if there\nis a subset \\(V\\) of \\(A\\) for which \\(U \\cap V = \\varnothing\\) and\n\\(U \\cup V = A\\).  Diaconescu’s argument amounts to a derivation\nfrom AC4 (see above) of the assertion that every\nsubset of a set is detachable, from which Excluded Middle readily\nfollows. Here it is. \n First, given \\(U \\subseteq A\\), an indicator for\n\\(U\\) (in \\(A\\)) is a map \\(g: A \\times 2 \\rightarrow 2\\) \nsatisfying \n It is then easy to show that a subset is detachable if and only if\nit has an indicator.  \n Now we show that, if AC4 holds, then any subset of a\nset has an indicator, and hence is detachable. \n For \\(U \\subseteq A\\), let \\(R\\) be the binary\nrelation on \\(A + A = A \\times \\{0\\} \\cup A \\times \\{1\\}\\)\ngiven by \nIt can be checked that \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation. Write\n\\(r\\) for the natural map from \\(A + A\\) to the\n quotient[21]\n \\(Q\\) of \\((A + A)\\) by \\(R\\) which carries\neach member of \\(A + A\\) to its \\(R-\\)equivalence\nclass. \n Now apply AC4 to obtain a map \n\\(f: Q \\rightarrow  A + A\\) satisfying \n\\(f(X) \\in X\\) for all \\(X \\in Q\\). It is then not\nhard to show that, writing \\(\\pi_{1}\\) for projection on the\nfirst coordinate, and \n Now define \\(g: A \\times 2 \\rightarrow 2\\) by \\(g = \\pi_{2} \\circ f\n\\circ r\\), where \\(\\pi_2\\) is a projection on the second\ncoordinate. Then \\(g\\) is an indicator for \\(U\\), as the\nfollowing equivalences show: \nThe proof is complete. \n It can be shown (Bell 2006) that each of a number of\nintuitionistically invalid logical principles, including the law of\nexcluded middle, is equivalent (in intuitionistic set theory)\nto a suitably weakened version of the axiom of choice.  Accordingly\nthese logical principles may be viewed as choice principles. \nHere are the logical principles at issue: \n Over intuitionistic logic, Lin,\nStone and Ex are consequences of\nSLEM; and Un implies\nDis. All of these schemes follow, of course, from the\nfull law of excluded middle, that is SLEM for\narbitrary formulas. \n In what follows the empty set is denoted by 0, \\(\\{0\\}\\) by 1, and\n\\(\\{0, 1\\}\\) by 2.  \n We formulate the following choice principles—here \\(X\\)\nis an arbitrary set, \\(\\Fun(X)\\) the class of functions with\ndomain \\(X\\) and \\(\\phi(x,y)\\) an arbitrary\nformula of the language of set theory with at most the free variables\n\\(x\\), \\(y\\): \n The first two of these are forms of AC for\n\\(X\\); while classically equivalent, in IST\nAC\\(^*_X\\) implies AC\\(_X\\), but not\nconversely. The principles DAC\\(_X\\) and\nDAC\\(^*_X\\) are dual forms of the axiom of\nchoice for \\(X\\): classically they are both equivalent to\nAC\\(_X\\) and AC\\(^*_X\\) but\nintuitionistically DAC\\(^*_X\\)\nimplies DAC\\(_X\\), and not conversely. \nWe also formulate the weak extensional selection principle,\nin which \\(\\alpha(x)\\) and \\(\\beta(x)\\) are any formulas\nwith at most the variable \\(x\\) free: \n WESP:\n\\({\\exists x\\inn 2}\\ \\alpha(x) \\wedge\n{\\exists x \\inn 2}\\ \\beta(x) \\rightarrow \n{\\exists x \\inn 2}\\ {\\exists y \\inn 2}\\ [\\alpha(x) \\wedge\n\\beta(y) \\wedge [{\\forall x \\inn 2}\\\n[\\alpha(x) \\leftrightarrow \\beta(x)] \\rightarrow  x = y]].\\)\n \n This principle, a straightforward consequence of the axiom of choice,\nasserts that, for any pair of instantiated properties of members of 2,\ninstances may be assigned to the properties in a manner that depends\njust on their extensions. \n Each of the logical principles tabulated above is equivalent (in\nIST) to a choice principle. In fact: \n Further, while DAC\\(_1\\) is easily seen to be\nprovable in IST, we have \n Next, while AC\\(_2\\) is easily proved in\nIST, by contrast we have \n In order to provide choice schemes equivalent to Lin\nand Stone we introduce \n  ac\\(^*_X\\):\n\\({\\exists f \\inn 2^X} [{\\forall x\\inn X}\\ {\\exists y \\inn 2}\\ \\phi(x,y) \n\\rightarrow {\\exists x \\inn X}\\ \\phi(x,fx)]\\)\n \n  wac\\(^*_X\\):\n\\({\\exists f \\inn 2^X} [{\\forall x \\inn X}\\ {\\exists y \\inn 2}\\ \\phi(x,y) \n\\rightarrow  {\\forall x \\inn X}\\ \\phi(x,fx)]\\) provided it is provable in\nIST that \n\\(\\forall x[\\phi(x,0) \\rightarrow  \\neg\\phi(x,1)]\\) \nClearly ac\\(^*_X\\) is equivalent to \n\\({\\exists f \\inn 2^X}[{\\forall x \\inn X}[\\phi(x,0) \\vee \\phi(x,1)] \\rightarrow \n{\\forall x \\inn X}\\ \\phi(x,fx)]\\)\n \n and similarly for\ndac\\(^*_X\\). \n Then, over IST,\nac\\(^*_1\\) and dac\\(^*_1\\) are\nequivalent, respectively, to Lin and\nStone. \n These results show just how deeply choice principles interact with\nlogic, when the background logic is assumed to be intuitionistic. In a\nclassical setting where the Law of Excluded Middle is assumed these\nconnections are obliterated. \n Readers interested in the topic of the axiom of choice and type theory\nmay consult the following supplementary document:","contact.mail":"jbell@uwo.ca","contact.domain":"uwo.ca"}]
