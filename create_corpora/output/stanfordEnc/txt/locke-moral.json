The moral\nphilosophy developed in this work is rarely taken up for critical\nanalysis, considered by many scholars of Locke’s thought to be too\nobscure and confusing to be taken too seriously. The view is not only\nseen by many commentators as incomplete, but it carries a degree of\nrationalism that cannot be made consistent with our picture of Locke\nas the arch-empiricist of his period. While it is true that Locke’s\ndiscussion of morality in the Essay is not as well-developed as\nmany of his other views, there is reason to think that morality was\nthe driving concern of this great work. For Locke, morality is the one\narea apart from mathematics wherein human reasoning can attain a level\nof rational certitude. For Locke, human reason may be weak with\nregards to our understanding of the natural world and the workings of\nthe human mind, but it is exactly suited for the job of figuring out\nhuman moral duty. By looking at Locke’s moral philosophy, as it is\ndeveloped in the Essay and some of his earlier writings, we\ngain a heightened appreciation for Locke’s motivations in the\nEssay, as well as a more nuanced understanding of the degree of\nLocke’s empiricism. Further than this, Locke’s moral philosophy offers\nus an important exemplar of seventeenth-century natural law theory,\nprobably the predominant moral view of the period.\n\nThere are two main stumbling blocks to the study of Locke’s moral\nphilosophy. The first regards the singular lack of attention the\nsubject receives in Locke’s most important and influential published\nworks; not only did Locke never publish a work devoted to moral\nphilosophy, but he dedicates little space to its discussion in the\nworks he did publish. The traditional moral concept of natural law\narises in Locke’s Two Treatises of Government (1690) serving\nas a major plank in his argument regarding the basis for civil law and\nthe protection of individual liberty, but he does not go into any\ndetail regarding how we come to know natural law nor how we might be\nobligated, or even motivated, to obey it. In his Essay Concerning\nHuman Understanding (first edition 1690; fourth edition 1700,\nhereafter referred to as the Essay) Locke spends little time\ndiscussing morality, and what he does provide in the way of a moral\nepistemology seems underdeveloped, offering, at best, the suggestion\nof what a moral system might look like rather than a fully-realized\npositive moral position. This brings us to the second major stumbling\nblock: What Locke does provide us by way of moral theory in these\nworks is diffuse, with the air of being what J.B. Schneewind has\ncharacterized as “brief, scattered and sometimes puzzling”\n(Schneewind 1994, 200). This is not to suggest that Locke says nothing\nspecific or concrete about morality. Locke makes references,\nthroughout his works, to morality and moral obligation. However, two\nquite distinct positions on morality seem to emerge from Locke’s works\nand it is this dichotomous aspect of Locke’s view that has generated\nthe greatest degree of controversy. The first is a natural\nlaw position, which Locke refers to in the Essay, but\nwhich finds its clearest articulation in an early work from the 1660s,\nentitled Essays on the Law of Nature. In this work, we find\nLocke espousing a fairly traditional rationalistic natural law\nposition, which consists broadly in the following three propositions:\nfirst, that moral rules are founded on divine, universal and absolute\nlaws; second, that these divine moral laws are discernible by human\nreason; and third, that by dint of their divine authorship these rules\nare obligatory and rationally discernible as such. On the other hand,\nLocke also espouses a hedonistic moral theory, in evidence in his\nearly work, but developed most fully in the Essay. This\nlatter view holds that all goods and evils reduce to specific kinds of\npleasures and pains. The emphasis here is on sanctions, and how\nrewards and punishments serve to provide morality with its normative\nforce. Both elements find their way into Locke’s published works, and,\nas a result, Locke seems to be holding what seem to be incommensurable\nviews. The trick for Locke scholars has been to figure out how, or\neven if, they can be made to cohere. The question is not easily\nsettled by looking to Locke’s unpublished works, either, since Locke\nalso seems to hold a natural law view at some times and a hedonistic\nview at others. \nOne might conclude, with J.B. Schneewind, among others, that Locke’s\nattempts at constructing a morality were unsuccessful. Schneewind does\nnot mince words when he writes the following: “Locke’s failures\nare sometimes as significant as his successes. His views on morality\nare a case in point” (Schneewind 1994, 199). Schneewind argues\nthat the two strands of Locke’s moral theory are irreconcilable, and\nthat this is a fact Locke must have realized. This view is indeed an\napt representation of the frustration many readers have felt with\nLocke’s moral theory. Locke’s eighteenth-century apologist, Catharine\nTrotter Cockburn thought Locke provided a promising, but incomplete,\nstarting point for a positive moral system, imploring, in her work\n“A Defense of Mr. Locke’s Essay of Human\nUnderstanding,” \nLocke’s friend William Molyneux similarly implored Locke to make good\non the promise found in the Essay. In a letter written to\nLocke on September 16th, 1693, Molyneux presses Locke to\nwork on a moral treatise once he has finished editing the second\nedition of his Essay, writing as follows: \nSeveral months later, in December of the same year, Molyneux concludes\na letter by asking Locke about what other projects he currently has on\nthe go “amongst which, I hope you will not forget your\nThoughts on Morality” (Locke 1742, 54). \nLocke never did produce such a work, and we might well wonder if he\nhimself ever considered the project a “failure”. There is\nno doubt that morality was of central importance to Locke, a fact we\ncan discern from the Essay itself; there are two important\nfeatures of the Essay that serve to enlighten us regarding\nthe significance of this work in the development of Locke’s moral\nviews. First of all, morality seems to have inspired Locke to write\nthe Essay in the first place. In recounting his original\ninclination to embark on the project, he recalls a discussion with\n“five or six friends”, at which they discoursed “on\na Subject very remote from this” (Locke 1700, 7). According to\nLocke, the discussion eventually hit a standstill, at which point it\nwas agreed that in order to settle the issue at hand it would first be\nnecessary to, as Locke puts it, “examine our own Abilities, and\nsee, what Objects our Understandings were, or were not fitted to deal\nwith” (Locke 1700, 7). This was, he explains, his first entrance\ninto the problems that inspired the Essay itself. But, what\nis most interesting for our purposes is just what the remote subject\nwas that first got Locke and his friends thinking about fundamental\nquestions of epistemology. James Tyrell, one of those who attended\nthat evening, is a source of enlightenment on this matter—he\nlater recalled that the discussion concerned morality and revealed\nreligion. But, Locke himself refers to the subjects they discussed\nthat fateful evening as ‘very remote’ from the matters of\nthe Essay. That may well be, but it is also true that Locke,\nin the Essay, identifies morality as a central feature of\nhuman intellectual and practical life, which brings us to the second\nimportant fact about Locke’s view of morality. Locke writes, in the\nEssay, that “Morality is the proper Science, and\nBusiness of Mankind in general” (Essay, 4.12.11; these\nnumber are, book, chapter and section, respectively, from Locke’s\nEssay). For a book aiming to set out the limits and extent of\nhuman knowledge, this comes as no small claim. We must, Locke writes,\n“know our own Strength” (Essay, 1.1.6)\nand turn our attention to those areas in which we can have certainty,\ni.e., “those [things] which concern our Conduct”\n(Essay, 1.1.6). The amount of attention given to the question\nof morality itself would seem to belie its primacy for Locke. The\nEssay is certainly not intended as a work of moral\nphilosophy; it is a work of epistemology, laying the foundations for\nknowledge. However, a very big part of the programme involves\nidentifying what true knowledge is and what it is we as humans can\nhave knowledge about, and morality is accorded a distinctive and\nfairly exclusive status in Locke’s epistemology as one of “the\nSciences capable of Demonstration” (Essay, 4.3.18). The\nonly other area of inquiry accorded this status is mathematics;\nclearly, for Locke, morality represents a unique and defining aspect\nof what it means to be human. We have to conclude, then, that the\nEssay is strongly motivated by an interest in establishing\nthe groundwork for moral reasoning. However, while morality clearly\nhas a position of the highest regard in his epistemological system,\nhis promise of a demonstrable moral science is never realized here, or\nin later works. \nIt seems we can safely say that the subject of morality was a weighty\none for Locke. However, just what Locke takes morality to involve is\nsubstantially more complicated an issue. There are two broad lines of\ninterpretation of Locke’s moral views, which I will briefly outline\nhere. \nThe first interpretation of Locke’s moral theory is what we might call\nan incompatibility thesis: Locke scholars Laslett, Aaron, von Leyden,\namong others, hold that Locke’s natural law theory is nothing more\nthan a relic from Locke’s early years, when he wrote the Essays on\nthe Law of Nature, and represents a rogue element in the mature\nempiricist framework of the Essay. For these commentators,\nthe two elements found in the Essay seem not only\nincommensurable, but the hedonism seems the obvious and\nstraightforward fit with Locke’s generally empiricist epistemology.\nThe general view is that Locke’s rationalism seems, for all intents\nand purposes, to have no significant role to play, either in the\nacquisition of moral knowledge or in the recognition of the obligatory\nforce of moral rules. These fundamental aspects of morality seem to be\ntaken care of by Locke’s hedonism. Worse than this, however, is that\nthe two views rely on radically different epistemological principles.\nThe conclusion tends to be that Locke is holding on to moral\nrationalism in the face of serious incoherence. The incompatibility\nthesis is supported by the fact that Locke seems to emphasize the role\nof pleasure and pain in moral decision-making, however it has\ndifficulty making sense of the presence of Locke’s moral rationalism\nin the Essay and other of Locke’s later works (not to mention\nthe exalted role he gives to rationally-deduced moral law). Added to\nthis, even in Locke’s early work, he seems to hold both positions\nsimultaneously. Aaron and von Leyden both throw up their hands.\nAccording to von Leyden, in the introduction to his 1954 edition of\nLocke’s Essays on the Law of Nature, \nIn a similar vein, Aaron writes: \nYet, it is curious that Locke neither claimed to find these strands\nincompatible, nor ever abandoned his rationalistic natural law view.\nIt seems unlikely that this view would be nothing more than a\nconfusing hangover from earlier days. Taking seriously Locke’s\ncommitment to both is therefore a much more charitable approach, and\none that takes seriously Locke’s clear commitment to the benefits of\nrationally-apprehending our moral duties. An approach along these\nlines is one we might call a compatibility approach to the question of\nLocke’s moral commitments. John Colman and Stephen Darwall are two\nLocke scholars who have argued that Locke’s view is neither plagued\nwith tensions nor incoherent. Their common view is that the two\nelements of Locke’s theory are doing different work. Locke’s hedonism,\non this compatibility account, is intended as a theory of moral\nmotivation, and serves to fill a motivational gap between knowing\nmoral law and having reasons to obey moral law. Locke introduces\nhedonism in order to account for the practical force of the\nobligations arising from natural law. As Darwall writes, \nThus, on this account, reason deduces natural law, but it is\nhedonistic considerations alone that offer agents the motivating\nreasons to act in accordance with its dictates. \nThis interpretation convincingly makes room for both elements in\nLocke’s view. A central feature of this interpretation is its\nattention to the legalistic aspect of Locke’s natural law theory. For\nLocke, the very notion of law presupposes an authority structure as\nthe basis for its institution and its enforcement. The law carries\nobligatory weight by virtue of its reflecting the will of a rightful\nsuperior. That it also carries the threat of sanctions lends\nmotivational force to the law. \nA slight modification of the compatibility account, however, better\ncaptures the motivational aspect of Locke’s rationalistic account:\nLocke does, at times suggest that rational agents are not only\nobligated, but motivated, by sheer recognition of the divine authority\nof moral law. It is helpful to think of morality as carrying both\nintrinsic and extrinsic obligatory force for Locke. On the one hand\nmoral rules obligate by dint of their divine righteousness, and on the\nother hand by the threat of rewards and punishments. The suggestion\nthat morality has an intrinsic motivational force appears in the\nEssays on the Law of Nature and is retained by Locke in some\nof his final published works. It is, however, a feature of his view\nthat gets somewhat underappreciated in the secondary literature, and\nfor understandable reasons—Locke tends to emphasize hedonistic\nmotivations. Why this is will be discussed in\n section 4.\n At this point, however, it suffices to say that Locke’s theory does\nnot have the motivational gap that the compatibility thesis\nsuggests—hedonism serves as a ‘back-up’ motivational\ntool in the absence of the right degree of rational intuition of one’s\nmoral duty. \nIn order to get a complete understanding of Locke’s moral theory, it\nis useful to begin with a look at Locke’s natural law view,\narticulated most fully in his Essays on the Law of Nature\n(written as series of lectures he delivered as Censor of Moral\nPhilosophy at Christ Church, Oxford). Two predominant features of\nLocke’s natural law theory are already well-developed in this work:\nthe rationalism and the legalism. According to Locke, reason is the\nprimary avenue by which humans come to understand moral rules, and it\nis via reason we can draw two distinct but related conclusions\nregarding the grounds for our moral obligations: we can appreciate the\ndivine, and thereby righteous, nature of morality and we can\nperceive that morality is the expression of a law-making\nauthority. \nIn the Essays on the Law of Nature, Locke writes that\n“all the requisites of a law are found in natural law”\n(Locke 1663–4, 82). But, what, for Locke, is required for\nsomething to be a law? Locke takes stock of what constitutes law in\norder to establish the legalistic framework for morality: First, law\nmust be founded on the will of a superior. Second, it must perform the\nfunction of establishing rules of behavior. Third, it must be binding\non humans, since there is a duty of compliance owed to the superior\nauthority that institutes the laws (Locke 1663–4, 83). Natural\nlaw is rightly called law because it satisfies these\nconditions. For Locke, the concept of morality is best understood by\nreference to a law-like authority structure, for without this, he\nargues, moral rules would be indistinguishable from social\nconventions. In one his later essays, “Of Ethic in\nGeneral”, Locke writes \nFor Locke, then, moral law is, by definition, an obligatory set of\nrules, because it reflects the will of a superior\nauthority. \nMoral rules are obligatory because of the authority structure out of\nwhich they arise. But, this is not the only story Locke has to tell\nregarding the nature of our obligation to divine moral dictates. The\nset of moral rules that reason deduces are taken by Locke to be\nreflective of human nature. The rules that govern human conduct are\nspecifically tailored to human nature, and our duty to God involves\nrealizing our natures to the fullest degree. There is a noticeable\ndegree of teleology in Locke’s theory, which is worth pausing to\nconsider in its content and its implications. \nIn the Essays on the Law of Nature, Locke draws a connection\nbetween the natural law governing human action and the laws of nature\nthat govern all other things in the natural world; just as all natural\nthings seem nomologically determined, so human beings are likewise\nlaw-governed. Humans are not determined to the same degree as other\nphysical and biological entities, but we are beholden to God to ensure\nthat our lives follow a certain path. Natural law is, Locke writes, a\n“plan, rule, or … pattern” of life (Locke\n1663–64, 81). Locke’s early view has a teleological strain\ntypical of the Aquinian (and thus Aristotelian) tradition. In fact,\nLocke does not shy away from this teleological angle, acknowledging\nthis inheritance when he writes of Aristotle’s that he \nLocke considers moral duty to be tailored to human nature, a set of\nlaws specific to humanity and governing our actions according to God’s\nwill. These laws are not only discoverable by reason, but in order to\nfulfill our function, humans are required to make use of reason to\nthis very end. This view resurfaces in the Essay, where Locke\nwrites the following: \nThe way it points us, he goes on to explain, is in the direction of\nour “greatest interests, i.e., the Condition of our eternal\nEstate” (Essay, 4.12.11). The greater effort we each\nmake in refining our rational faculty, the more clearly each of us\nwill discern the proper path to eternal salvation. \nThis teleological element may seem somewhat out of step with Locke’s\nunqualified empiricist rejection of teleological metaphysics in the\nEssay. However, it is important to bear in mind that the\nteleological aspects of Locke’s moral theory do seem to be serving a\nvery specific purpose. Locke seems to be aiming to establish a\nnatural-theological basis for natural law. Why would this be so\ncrucial for Locke? \nLocke is grounding human conduct within a general framework of laws\noriginating in God’s divine command. This is not just a\nnomologically-ordered universe, but one, as we have seen, that\nreflects the interests of “a powerful and wise\ncreator…who has made and built this whole universe and us\nmortals” (Locke 1663–64, 103). Humans are obligated to obey\nGod’s laws since God is a superior to whom we owe “both our\nbeing and our work” (Locke 1663–64, 105). As such, we are\nobligated to show obedience to the “limits he prescribes”\n(Locke 1663–64, 105). The laws governing our nature are\ndiscovered by reason and their content is specifically suited to human\nnature. Thus, for Locke morality is clearly and necessarily\nanthropocentric, understood by reference to human nature. But moral\nrules are, above all, an expression of God’s will. It is this latter\naspect of morality that binds us to abide by the dictates of morality.\nMoral obligation is a matter, for Locke, of obedience to the rightful\nauthority of God. \nThere are two baseline assumptions of Locke’s moral thinking: morality\nis universal and it is something that can be understood clearly and\nunequivocally by human reason—when Locke imagines us\nrationally-discovering natural law, he envisions us applying a\nrigorous set of logical principles to a set of clear and well-defined\nideas about human nature, God, and society. But, how exactly is this\ndone? \nFor one thing, this process looks a great deal like mathematical\nreasoning. For Locke, moral rules are founded on a fundamental set of\nprinciples, much like mathematical axioms. The fundamental principles\ncan be deduced rationally, and it is from these that we can further\nderive all of our moral duties. Morality is, therefore, demonstrable,\na term indicating mathematical-style proofs wherein conclusions are\nderived from axiomatic foundations. The moral status of any action is\nthen determined by comparing our behaviour against these demonstrated\nrules. But, we might ask, what kinds of ideas are moral\nideas, and what sort of rationalist could Locke possibly be? Locke is\na well-known empiricist; for Locke, the mind is a blank slate, the\ncontent of which is supplied exclusively from sensory or reflective\nexperience. Locke famously espouses this empiricist view in the\nEssay, but holds it quite clearly also in the Essays on\nthe Law of Nature. In fact, however, Locke’s moral\nrationalism takes this empiricist theory of ideas as its starting\npoint. Moral ideas, for Locke, are fundamentally experiential in\norigin. They are not directly so, of course, since we do not perceive\nsomething like justice or honesty directly. Moral ideas are\nexperiential, in the special Lockean sense that they are complex\nideas—products of the mind’s ability to form complex\nconstructions from its simple directly-experiential contents. For\nLocke, the interplay of reason and sensation works as follows: \nFrom perceptual simple ideas, we can generate complex moral\npropositions. This seems like a tall order, and Locke offers very\nlittle, in any of his works, by way of actually putting this moral\nreasoning process to work. However, that is not to say that Locke is\nsilent in this regard. There are places in his writings where Locke\ntakes us through some moral demonstrations. \nIn the Essays on the Law of Nature, for example, Locke claims\nthat, based on sensory experience, we can assert the extra-mental\nexistence of perceptible objects and all their perceptible qualities.\nAll such qualities can be explained by reference to matter in motion.\nWhat is also clear to the senses, Locke argues, is that this world of\nmoving objects exhibits a nomological regularity, or as Locke puts it,\na “wonderful art and regularity” (Locke 1663–64,\n103). Such regularity and beauty leads the contemplative mind to\nconsider how such a world could have come about. Such contemplation\nwould lead any rational being to the conclusion that the world cannot\nbe the result of chance, and must therefore be the product of a\ncreative will. Note that Locke is here trying to demonstrate for us\njust how sensation and reason work together. The mind moves from ideas\nof sensation to what Locke considers logical conclusions regarding the\ncreative force behind the world we experience. But, our understanding\nof natural law is not founded solely in sensory experience. Through\nreflection, which is an introspective kind of perceptual experience\nfor Locke, humans can gain ideas of our own nature and faculties that\nserve to complete our understanding both of God and of God’s creative\nwill. This reasoning goes as follows—the creative being, which\nsensation indicates must exist, cannot be less perfect than\nhuman will, nor can it be human, because our ideas of\nreflection tell us that humans are not, and cannot be, self-causing.\nReason must conclude, then, that the world is created by a divine\nwill—a superior power, which can bring us into existence,\nmaintain us, or take us away, give us great joy or render us in great\npain. Locke concludes as follows: \nFrom this deduction regarding divine purpose and authority, humans can\nconclude that they are obligated to render “praise, honour, and\nglory” to God. Beyond this, the rational agent can deduce,\nthrough reflection upon her own constitution and faculties, that her\nnatural impulses to protect and preserve her life, and to enter into\nsociety with others are faculties with which she has been uniquely\nequipped by God and by which she is considered specifically human.\nThese must constitute the basis of the principles and duties governing\nher conduct—her “function appears to be that which nature\nhas prepared … [her] to perform” (Locke 1663–64,\n105). Thus, by a series of steps from perception to reasoning about\nthat perceptual experience, we are, Locke concludes, able to define\nour moral duties and regulate our conduct accordingly. \nIn the Essay, Locke develops this idea of the rational\ndeduction of natural law somewhat further, setting it in the context\nof a more mature and coherent theory of ideas than we find in the\nEssays on the Law of Nature. In the Essay, moral\nideas assume a particular significance owing to their place in Locke’s\ngeneral taxonomy of ideas. For Locke, all the basic contents of the\nmind are simple ideas. These are formed by the mind into what Locke\nterms complex ideas, which are combinations of simple ideas made in\nthe pattern of our perceptions of things in the extra mental world, or\naccording to a pattern created by reason alone. Moral ideas fall into\nthe second category of complex idea, falling under the technical\nheading complex ideas of modes. Modes are a specific kind of\ncomplex ideas, created by the mind from simple ideas of sensation or\nreflection, but referring to no extra-mental reality. They are not\nintended as natural kinds, but are products of the mind alone,\nreferring to purely conceptual archetypes. They are best understood in\ncontradistinction to ideas of substances, which are created by the\nmind but aim to mirror the real essences of extra-mental\nthings—for example, the idea cat is intended to capture\na kind of thing in the world that has a specific set of perceivable\ncharacteristics. Ideas of substances fail in mirroring reality,\nhowever, as they can never be complete representations of the world\noutside the mind. Modal ideas, on the other hand, are a special kind\nof idea for Locke, and actually hold out the promise for real\nknowledge. Modal ideas are ideas by which we fully grasp the real\nessence of things, because the mind, in some sense, is the originator\nof them (I will return to this in the next paragraph). The idea of a\ntriangle is a modal idea, made by reason and knowable in its essence\nwith complete accuracy. The idea of a triangle is a product of the\nmind, and does not refer to anything outside the mind—i.e., any\nexternal archetype. The kinds of ideas that fall into this category\nare the idea of God, mathematical concepts, and, most importantly for\nour present purposes, moral concepts. Locke writes,  \nMoral rules, for Locke, are knowable with the same degree of certainty\nas “any Demonstration in Euclid” (Essay,\n4.3.18). \nThis might seem to be a tall order when considering the controversy\ngenerated by beliefs about moral rules, yet Locke clearly believes\nthat moral rules can, with the right mental effort, yield indisputable\nuniversal laws. Locke offers an example of how this might work, by\nanalyzing the moral proposition Where there is no property, there\nis no injustice. In order to see the demonstrable certainty of\nthis claim, we have to examine the composite ideas and how those agree\nor disagree with one another. The idea of property, first of all, is a\nright to something. The idea of injustice, considered next, is a\nviolation of that right. Given these definitions, which Locke thinks\nare arrived at by careful attention to definition, it is a rational\ndeduction that injustice cannot exist if there is no property to be\nviolated. Injustice and property must, by definition agree. This is a\nclearly demonstrable rule, according to Locke, deduced from clear and\nadequately conceived ideas. The only other example Locke offers is the\nproposition No Government allows absolute Liberty.\nGovernment, according to Locke, is the establishment of society upon\ncertain laws, requiring conformity. Absolute liberty is allowing\nanyone to do as they please. These are modal ideas, according to\nLocke, and thus known with complete adequacy. As such, it is possible\nfor the rational individual to see clearly that the ideas of absolute\nliberty and government cannot agree. Of course, most people will argue\nthat these rational deductions rely upon definitions that are\ndebatable. This would not seem to be helped by the fact that, for\nLocke, modal ideas, like all complex ideas, are put together by the\nmind; while complex ideas of substance are constructed on the pattern\nof perceivable objects, modal ideas are, Locke explains, “put\ntogether at the pleasure of our Thoughts, without any real pattern\nthey were taken from” (Essay, 4.4.12). This might seem\nto pose a problem for Locke’s moral theory, according to which moral\nlaws are just as necessary as mathematical principles. However, Locke\nis not worried about any relativistic implications. For Locke, any\ndisagreement about definitions of concepts like property, justice or\nmurder, result from insufficient reasoning about the simple ideas that\ncomprise our moral ideas, as well as bias, prejudice and other\nirrational influences. For Locke, it is precisely because these ideas\nrefer to nothing outside the mind that they can be\nuniversally-conceived and adequately understood. Just as the notion of\ntriangularity is known perfectly because it does not depend upon the\nexistence of triangles outside the mind, so justice is understood\nperfectly because it is not using some extramental archetype as its\ninspiration. He writes, \nMathematical concepts are impervious to bias, prejudice or\notherwise-idiosyncratic definitions and their relative properties are\nclear to anyone who understands them perfectly. While many would\ncontend that moral ideas are simply too controversial to fit a\nproto-mathematical picture, Locke would respond that they seem\ncontroversial only because many of us have not taken the time to\nconsider moral ideas in an objective and analytical light. If we were\nto do so, he argues, we could come to know moral rules with\ncertainty. \nLocke, in fact, adds something of a meta-moral dimension to this\nepistemological point by suggesting that as rational beings it is our\n“proper Imployment” to contemplate morality. In Book IV of\nthe Essay, where Locke concludes that morality is, like\nmathematics, a human science (and, properly-speaking, knowledge),\nLocke draws a teleological lesson—since we are clearly fitted\nwith the capacity for discerning our moral duty, then that is what we\nought to do: “I think I may conclude, that Morality is\nthe proper Science and Business of Mankind in general.”\n(Essay, 4.12.11) Humans must, he argues, employ reason in the\npursuit of that which “they are most adapted to, and follow the\ndirection of Nature, where it seems to point us out the way”\n(Essay, 4.12.11). The fact that many people do not or cannot\ndevote contemplative hours to their moral duties is something Locke\nwill consider in his account of moral motivation, however, the key\npoint here is that humans have a teleological makeup that allows for\nrational certainty with regard to divine moral law. \nIs having this degree of knowledge enough to motivate humans to act\naccordingly—that is, does the sheer recognition of one’s duty\nhave any sway in one’s practical deliberations? \nLocke’s hedonism has a dual function in Locke’s moral theory. It\naccounts both for how we acquire the ideas of moral good and evil that\nlie at the root of moral law and for the motivation to comply\nwith moral rules. A prominent feature of Locke’s moral legalism is his\nview that a law needs to carry the threat of sanctions for it to have\nnormative force. Locke holds this view on the basis of his hedonistic\ntheory of human motivation. \nLocke develops his hedonistic account most extensively in the\nEssay. According to this account, pleasure and pain are the\nprimary motivating factors for all human action and human thought.\nFeelings of pleasure and pain accompany all our ideas, for Locke,\nprompting us to act in response to our perceptual experiences, and to\nmove, in thought, from one idea to another. If we had no accompanying\nfeeling of delight or pain in the face of certain stimuli we would be\nunmoved to create music, eat when hungry, or even shift our attention\nfrom one idea to any other—the perception of rain would raise in\nus no different response than a sunny day, the idea of one’s children\nwould inspire no related thoughts of home or family, nor any\ndiscernibly different response from the idea of children one does not\nknow. Locke writes, \nPleasure and pain are the engines that make decisions, thoughts, and\nactions happen. This is not merely coincidence, or chance, for Locke,\nbut yet another example of God’s divine design. God has attached\nfeelings of pleasure and pain to our ideas, so the natural faculties\nwith which humans are endowed “might not remain wholly idle, and\nunemploy’d by us” (Essay, 2.7.3). \nPleasure and pain form the basis of Locke’s general theory of\nmotivation, but they are also the bedrock upon which our moral ideas,\nand the motivation to moral goodness arise. Good and\nevil reduce, for Locke, to “nothing but Pleasure or\nPain, or that which occasions or procures Pleasure and Pain to\nus” (Essay, 2.28.5). A flower is good, because its\nbeauty raises feelings of affection or pleasure in us. Illness, on the\nother hand, is an evil since it raises feelings of aversion in those\nwho have experienced illness in any of its many forms. A good\nis whatever produces pleasure in us, or diminishes evil, and an\nevil is whatever produces pain or diminishes pleasure. In\nthis way, for Locke, the ideas of good and evil arise from natural\nemotive responses to our various ideas. Now, these are not moral goods\nand evils, but for Locke moral ideas are founded in the general ideas\nwe have of natural pleasures and pains. Locke designates no special\nfaculty by which we acquire the basic moral concepts of good and evil,\nsince these are merely a modification of our ideas of natural good and\nevil; moral good and evil gain their special significance from\nconsidering ideas of pleasure and pain in specific contexts. \nOur ideas of moral good and evil do not, therefore, differ\nqualitatively from natural good or evil. If this is the case,\nhowever, one might ask what makes smelling a rose different from\nhelping those in need. For Locke, the answer lies in the different\ncontext for pleasures and pains that distinguishes the moral from the\nnatural. While a natural good involves the physical pleasure that\narises from the scent of a rose, moral good is a pleasure\narising from one’s conformity to moral dictates, and moral\nevil is pain arising from the failure to conform. The pleasure and\npain are not qualitatively distinct, in these cases, but they take on\na special significance as a result of the considerations that bring\nthem about. Locke explains this in the Essay, making sure to\nemphasize the purely contextual distinction between moral and natural\nfeelings: \nReward and punishment are a distinct species of pleasure and pain,\nspecifying the outcomes attending the decrees of a rightful\nlegislator. In this way, Locke’s is a straightforwardly legalistic\naccount of the concepts of moral good and evil. The practical force of\nmoral laws arises when we compare our actions against these laws,\ndetermine the degree to which they do or do not conform to the law and\nconsider the pleasure of pain we will privately experience. In fact,\nfor Locke, the very idea that one being has rightful legislative power\nover another is predicated on the degree to which the former being can\neffectively impose sanctions on the latter: \nGod, according to Locke, is just such a rightful superior with the \nLocke is clearly committed to the idea that hedonistically-construed\noutcomes are a necessary condition of any system of law and of\nlegislative authority itself. In this regard, Locke’s views are\nconsistent throughout his corpus. It is worth noting that Locke holds\nthe same view in the early work, the Essays on the Law of\nNature, as he does in the more mature works quoted above. In the\nEssays on the Law of Nature, Essay V, Locke\nasserts that both God and the soul’s immortality “must\nnecessarily be presupposed if natural law is to exist” (Locke\n1663–64, 113). The inclusion of the immortality of the soul\nwould seem to suggest the centrality of rewards and punishments in the\nafterlife. Locke continues by asserting that “law is to no\npurpose without punishment” (Locke 1663–64, 113). For\nLocke, then, an agent may well know the moral law, and that they are\nobligated to a superior authority, but the obligatory\nforce—i.e., what gives the agent a reason for acting—is\nthe structure of rewards and punishments built into the system. \nThe question that has plagued Locke scholarship has been how, if at\nall, the hedonistic elements of Locke’s moral philosophy can be\nreconciled with his rationalistic account, which suggests that reason\ncan discern morality’s inherent righteousness and motivate\naccordingly. Some scholars have concluded that Locke effectively\nabandons the rationalism of his earlier writings by the time he is\nwriting the Essay, and that any such elements found therein\nare mere holdovers of an earlier position. Von Leyden expresses this\nview when he writes, \nBut does it? What I earlier called the compatibilist thesis is held\nmost prominently by scholars John Colman and Stephen Darwall,\naccording to whom Locke’s hedonism does not supplant the rationalist\naccount of natural law and moral obligation, but is, rather, intended\nto account for the motivational force of moral law. In this way, the\ntwo views work together for a complete moral picture. Darwall\nidentifies the distinction between rationally-derived versus\nlegalistically-construed moral obligation when he writes \nColman makes a similar point: \nBoth Darwall and Colman understand Locke as equating moral good and\nevil with rewards and punishments, such that good and evil are the\noperative notions that turn moral rules into moral imperatives for\nrational agents. Agents do not have reasons for acting until they are\naware of the rewards and punishments that accompany natural law. On\nthis interpretation, rational insight regarding the righteousness of\nmorality cannot, on its own, motivate humans to act. \nDivine sanctions are a constant feature of Locke’s moral philosophy,\nas we’ve seen, and the compatibilist interpretation goes much further\nthan the incompatibilist interpretation in capturing the nuances in\nLocke’s moral philosophy. However, there are passages in Locke’s work\nthat suggest that moral rules carry an obligatory force that can\nmotivate rational agents irrespective of rewards and punishments. When\nthis further aspect of Locke’s view is taken into account, we can see\nthat, for Locke, rewards and punishments do not exhaust our reasons\nfor obeying divine moral rules. \nIn the Essays on the Law of Nature, Locke argues that there\nare two different kinds of obedience to the law of a superior\nauthority, and that these are founded upon two distinct kinds of\nobligation. The example is as follows: \nAt this point, Locke might be understood to be distinguishing laws\nbacked by a rightful authority and laws that are not, in which the\npoint is simply that there is no obligation to the pirate, since his\nare not strictly laws at all on Locke’s definition of the term.\nHowever, Locke continues this passage as follows: \nLocke identifies two distinct grounds of obedience. Recognizing that\none’s obligation to the king arises from his rightful authority\nprovides a grounds for obedience that is absent in the case of obeying\nthe pirate. My reasons for obeying the pirate are hedonistic, but my\nreasons for obeying the king involve my recognition of his rightful\nauthority. Further on in the same Essay, Locke explains\nthat \nThus, sanctions are not the sole motivating factor for Locke. The\ncontrast Locke draws here is an important but commonly\nunderappreciated one; that is, acting for “conscience’\nsake” versus acting ‘out of fear’ as two\nquite distinct grounds for obedience. \nThe question that remains is how Locke’s notion of acting ‘for\nconscience’ sake’ can be made sense of within the context of\nLocke’s general hedonistic account of motivation. It might sound as\nthough we are working with the kind of purely rational motivating\nfactor that Locke’s hedonistic theory clearly rejects; for Locke\nall human action is motivated by considerations of pleasure\nand pain. \nRecall that for Locke rewards and punishments are specific pleasures\nand pains. Acting for conscience’ sake will necessarily involve\nconsiderations of pleasure and pain, but of a kind quite distinct from\nsanctions. For Locke, there is a kind of pleasure that attends\nfulfilling one’s moral duty that is quite distinct from considerations\nof reward and punishment. In an essay, written in 1692, entitled\nEthica A (the first of two essays, the other entitled\nEthica B), Locke appeals to a kind of pleasure that attends\nthe fulfilment of one’s moral duty: \nThe pleasure here is of a special kind. It is not the same as the\npleasure we get from satisfying our hunger, nor is it the pleasure\nthat comes with pleasing an authority or earning a reward. In fact,\nLocke explicitly distinguishes it from the pleasure expected in the\nafterlife. Fulfilling one’s duty, for Locke, carries its own kind of\npleasurable motive—it makes us happy. As Locke writes, further\non in Ethica A, “Happiness…is annexed to our\nloving others and to doing our duty, to acts of love and\ncharity” (Locke 1692, 319). Acting according to moral duty,\nthen, is motivated by feelings of pleasure that attend such acts. \nWhy, then, does Locke so frequently emphasize the legalistic angle of\nmorality, which depends so heavily on the motivational force of reward\nand punishment? In Locke’s view, many people fail to acknowledge, or\nbe motivated by, the pleasure inherent to the fulfilment of one’s\nmoral duty, and for these people (which, it turns out, is most of us),\nGod has provided extra incentive—the rewards and punishments God\nattaches to our actions are a matter of God’s jurisdiction, quite\napart from the pleasures of acting dutifully, and in accordance with\nrighteous moral dictates. As Locke explains, God \nSanctions, therefore, serve to enforce morality ‘the\nstronger’ but are quite clearly secondary to the intrinsic\npleasures motivating dutiful action. So, conscience does not motivate\nin and of itself, nor does the rational apprehension of one’s moral\nduty, but Locke identifies a species of pleasure distinct from divine\nsanctions that makes his notion of acting for conscience’ sake\nperfectly consistent with his hedonism: to act for conscience’\nsake is to be motivated by, and take pleasure in, acting in accordance\nwith one’s moral duty. \nLocke’s emphasis can be explained by turning our attention to a view\nof human nature that lies at the root of Locke’s account. Locke tends\nto be fairly pessimistic about the degree to which most humans\nappreciate the inherent righteousness of morality. In fact, Locke\nmaintains a fairly low opinion of the willingness of most people to\nactually take the time to appreciate the righteousness natural law.\nIf, he writes, \nHumans are flawed in two respects, according to Locke: we can fail to\nacknowledge our obligations to natural law, and we can fail to comply\neven when these obligations are acknowledged. \nLocke’s views regarding reason and intellectual duty can be\ncharacterized as an ethics of belief, according to which our rational\nabilities place a responsibility on each of us to examine the beliefs\nwe hold, and to be accountable for those things to which we assent.\nThis is particularly the case with respect to moral rules, themselves,\nwhich are the ultimate guidelines for a good human life. As Locke sees\nit, our capacities as rational agents are insufficiently realized in\nmany, if not most, cases. While the law of nature is knowable by\nreason for Locke, it is not innately known—Locke does not mean\nto suggest, as many theologians of his day believed, that it\n“lies open in our hearts” (Locke 1663–64, 89). This\nwould, he grants, be: \nFor Locke, however, this is just not the case. It is clear, to him,\nthat most people do not understand their moral duty in any deep or\nrobust way. To really know one’s moral duty is to be a moral agent,\nfor Locke—moral knowledge is something gained, by the\nindividual, through rational discovery. Moral truths are attainable\nwith the proper use of reason: \nFor Locke, knowledge, properly-speaking, requires that the individual\nherself perceives the truth or falsity of any claim to which she\ngrants or withholds assent. An individual agent must perform the\nintellectual analysis and demonstration herself in order to truly know\nher moral duty. As it turns out, however, the greatest number of\npeople (particularly in Locke’s day), are, he acknowledges \nFor these people, the opportunity for gaining a clear perception of\ntheir moral duty is very narrow. Worse than this, there are people who\nhave the means and the leisure, but “satisfy themselves with a\nlazy ignorance” (Essay, 4.20.6). These latter, Locke\nasserts, have a “low Opinion of their Souls”\n(Essay, 4.20.6). But, in neither case are people entirely off\nthe hook, according to Locke, who argues that no matter how busy one\nis, there should always be time for thinking about our souls and\nmatters of religion. If one fails to do this, then one is relying for\none’s salvation and self-realization upon the mere current of opinion\nor the untrustworthy word of others. Locke asks if this can\nprovide \nThe failure to do so is a kind of moral failing for Locke, one that\ngains its normative force from the teleogical imperative attending our\nrational natures: \nAgain, Locke is not suggesting that we do this from considerations of\nrewards and punishments, but because it is the fulfillment of our\ndivinely-created natures. Despite failures to comply, the normative\nforce of morality is undeniable, for Locke, on these teleogical\ngrounds. Though Locke seems to believe that our failings with regards\nto moral knowledge result from a failure to engage our minds in the\nright direction, he does however acknowledge that the discovery of\nmoral truths is difficult and laborious. And this is where sanctions\ncome into play. \nSanctions are not necessary to natural law if we consider it strictly\nas a system of divine rules. However, sanctions are necessary\nwhen morality functions as law. Sanctions are mechanisms for\nenforcement, where inherent motivating factors are either absent or\nunderappreciated. Consider, as an example, the moral duty to care for\none’s children. For most people, this carries inherent obligatory\nforce arising from its being obviously good and necessary. Where a\nperson fails to appreciate the inherent force of this duty, however,\nlaws exist that require parents to provide the means of life and\neducation for their children, and such laws stipulate compliance under\nthreat of sanctions. To call the first instance a law seems\nunnecessary, but we can clearly see how the concept of a rule of law\ndistinguishes the latter case. Sanctions provide motives when\nindividuals fail to act on the responsibilities reason should on its\nown reveal and thereby compel. In the Essays on the Law of\nNature, Locke writes, \nSanctions thus ensure that people who ‘refuse to be led’\nby reason abide by the dictates of natural law; in this way, sanctions\nensure that divine moral rules function as a system of law. \nWhen Locke speaks of moral law, he frequently alludes to sanctions.\nMorality can motivate without sanctions, but it cannot ensure\ngeneral compliance in the way that a system of law can. God’s\nimposition of sanctions is thus strictly instrumental. They are not\nintrinsic to a system of morality, but they are necessary when the\nobligatory force of moral rules is not adequately understood. The\nspecial role of sanctions as a means of shoring up moral compliance is\narticulated by Locke in several of his writings. In the 1680 essay\nOf God’s Justice, he writes \nGod metes out justice in the form of sanctions as a means of ensuring\nsocial order and peace; sanctions ensure social good: \nIn one of his more mature works, The Reasonableness of\nChristianity, Locke makes the point several times, that moral\nlaw, with its attendant rewards and punishments, was articulated as a\nmeans of ensuring obedience. Humans appreciate the intrinsic\nrighteousness of virtuous acts, which are generally granted the\nhighest degree of approbation. However, virtuous behaviour is assured\nonly when it is in an agent’s interests to comply. It is clear to\nreason that we ought to act virtuously, but it is easy enough for many\nof us to eschew virtuous actions when they either present hardships or\nsacrifice of any kind or when they will not clearly benefit our own\ninterests: \nIn order to remedy this problem, Locke explains, God attached clear\nand explicit sanctions (made plain through revelation) to ensure that\nthe virtuous course of action will always be the more attractive\noption:","contact.mail":"pmsherid@uoguelph.ca","contact.domain":"uoguelph.ca"}]
