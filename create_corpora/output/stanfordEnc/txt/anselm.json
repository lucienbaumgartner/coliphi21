He is\nbest known for the celebrated “ontological argument” for\nthe existence of God in the Proslogion, but his contributions\nto philosophical theology (and indeed to philosophy more generally) go\nwell beyond the ontological argument. In what follows I examine\nAnselm’s theistic proofs, his conception of the divine nature, and his\naccount of human freedom, sin, and redemption.\n\n\n\n\nAnselm was born in 1033 near Aosta, in those days a Burgundian town on\nthe frontier with Lombardy. Little is known of his early life. He left\nhome at twenty-three, and after three years of apparently aimless\ntravelling through Burgundy and France, he came to Normandy in 1059.\nOnce he was in Normandy, Anselm’s interest was captured by the\nBenedictine abbey at Bec, whose famous school was under the direction\nof Lanfranc, the abbey’s prior. Lanfranc was a scholar and\nteacher of wide reputation, and under his leadership the school at Bec\nhad become an important center of learning, especially in\ndialectic. In 1060 Anselm entered the abbey as a novice. His\nintellectual and spiritual gifts brought him rapid advancement, and\nwhen Lanfranc was appointed abbot of Caen in 1063, Anselm was elected\nto succeed him as prior. He was elected abbot in 1078 upon the death\nof Herluin, the founder and first abbot of Bec. Under Anselm’s\nleadership the reputation of Bec as an intellectual center grew, and\nAnselm managed to write a good deal of philosophy and theology in\naddition to his teaching, administrative duties, and extensive\ncorrespondence as an adviser and counselor to rulers and nobles all\nover Europe and beyond. His works while at Bec include the\nMonologion (1075–76), the Proslogion\n(1077–78), and his four philosophical dialogues: De\ngrammatico (probably 1059–60, though the dating of this\nwork is much disputed), and De veritate, De libertate\narbitrii, and De casu diaboli (1080–86).  \n\nIn 1093 Anselm was enthroned as Archbishop of Canterbury. The previous\nArchbishop, Anselm’s old master Lanfranc, had died four years\nearlier, but the King, William Rufus, had left the see vacant in order\nto plunder the archiepiscopal revenues. Anselm was understandably\nreluctant to undertake the primacy of the Church of England under a\nruler as ruthless and venal as William, and his tenure as Archbishop\nproved to be as turbulent and vexatious as he must have\nfeared. William was intent on maintaining royal authority over\necclesiastical affairs and would not be dictated to by Archbishop or\nPope or anyone else. So, for example, when Anselm went to Rome in 1097\nwithout the King’s permission, William would not allow him to\nreturn. When William was killed in 1100, his successor, Henry I,\ninvited Anselm to return to his see. But Henry was as intent as\nWilliam had been on maintaining royal jurisdiction over the Church,\nand Anselm found himself in exile again from 1103 to 1107. Despite\nthese distractions and troubles, Anselm continued to write. His works\nas Archbishop of Canterbury include the Epistola de Incarnatione\nVerbi (1094), Cur Deus Homo (1095–98), De\nconceptu virginali (1099), De processione Spiritus\nSancti (1102), the Epistola de sacrificio azymi et\nfermentati (1106–7), De sacramentis ecclesiae\n(1106–7), and De concordia (1107–8). Anselm died\non 21 April 1109. He was canonized in 1494 and named a Doctor of the\nChurch in 1720. \n\nAnselm’s motto is “faith seeking understanding”\n(fides quaerens intellectum). This motto lends itself to at\nleast two misunderstandings. First, many philosophers have taken it to\nmean that Anselm hopes to replace faith with\nunderstanding. If one takes ‘faith’ to mean roughly\n‘belief on the basis of testimony’ and\n‘understanding’ to mean ‘belief on the basis of\nphilosophical insight’, one is likely to regard faith as an\nepistemically substandard position; any self-respecting philosopher\nwould surely want to leave faith behind as quickly as possible. The\ntheistic proofs are then interpreted as the means by which we come to\nhave philosophical insight into things we previously believed solely\non testimony. But Anselm is not hoping to replace faith with\nunderstanding.  Faith for Anselm is more a volitional state than an\nepistemic state: it is love for God and a drive to act as God\nwills. In fact, Anselm describes the sort of faith that “merely\nbelieves what it ought to believe” as “dead”\n(M 78). (For the abbreviations used in references, see the\nBibliography below.) So “faith seeking understanding”\nmeans something like “an active love of God seeking a deeper\nknowledge of God.” \n\nOther philosophers have noted that “faith seeking\nunderstanding” begins with “faith,” not with doubt\nor suspension of belief.  Hence, they argue, the theistic\narguments proposed by faith seeking understanding are not really meant\nto convince unbelievers; they are intended solely for the edification\nof those who already believe.  This too is a misreading of\nAnselm’s motto. For although the theistic proofs are borne of an\nactive love of God seeking a deeper knowledge of the beloved, the\nproofs themselves are intended to be convincing even to\nunbelievers. Thus Anselm opens the Monologion with these\nwords: \n\nAnd in the Proslogion Anselm sets out to convince “the fool,”\nthat is, the person who “has said in his heart, ‘There is no\nGod’ ” (Psalm 14:1; 53:1).  \n\nHaving clarified what Anselm takes himself to be doing in his theistic\nproofs, we can now examine the proofs themselves. In the first chapter\nof the Monologion Anselm argues that there must be some one\nthing that is supremely good, through which all good things have their\ngoodness. For whenever we say that different things are F in\ndifferent degrees, we must understand them as being F through\nF-ness; F-ness itself is the same in each of them.\nThus, for example, all more or less just things “must be more or\nless just through justice, which is not different in diverse\nthings” (M 1). Now we speak of things as being\ngood in different degrees. So by the principle just stated,\nthese things must be good through some one thing. Clearly that thing\nis itself a great good, since it is the source of the goodness of all\nother things.  Moreover, that thing is good through itself;\nafter all, if all good things are good through that thing, it follows\ntrivially that that thing, being good, is good through itself. Things\nthat are good through another (i.e., things whose goodness derives\nfrom something other than themselves) cannot be equal to or greater\nthan the good thing that is good through itself, and so that which is\ngood through itself is supremely good. Anselm concludes,\n“Now that which is supremely good is also supremely great. There\nis, therefore, some one thing that is supremely good and supremely\ngreat – in other words, supreme among all existing things”\n(M 1). In chapter 2 he applies the principle of chapter 1 in\norder to derive (again) the conclusion that there is something\nsupremely great.  \n\nIn chapter 3 Anselm argues that all existing things exist through\nsome one thing. Every existing thing, he begins, exists either through\nsomething or through nothing. But of course nothing exists through\nnothing, so every existing thing exists through something. There is,\nthen, either some one thing through which all existing things exist, or\nthere is more than one such thing. If there is more than one, either\n(i) they all exist through some one thing, or (ii) each of them exists\nthrough itself, or (iii) they exist through each other. (iii) makes no\nsense. If (ii) is true, then “there is surely some one power or nature\nof self-existing that they have in order to exist through themselves”\n(M 3); in that case, “all things exist more truly through that\none thing than through the several things that cannot exist without\nthat one thing” (M 3). So (ii) collapses into (i), and there\nis some one thing through which all things exist. That one thing, of\ncourse, exists through itself, and so it is greater than all the other\nthings. It is therefore “best and greatest and supreme among all\nexisting things” (M 3). \n\nIn chapter 4 Anselm begins with the premise that things “are not all\nof equal dignity; rather, some of them are on different and unequal\nlevels” (M 4). For example, a horse is better than wood, and a\nhuman being is more excellent than a horse. Now it is absurd to think\nthat there is no limit to how high these levels can go, “so that there\nis no level so high that an even higher level cannot be found”\n(M 4). The only question is how many beings occupy that\nhighest level of all. Is there just one, or are there more than one?\nSuppose there are more than one. By hypothesis, they must all be\nequals. If they are equals, they are equals through the same thing.\nThat thing is either identical with them or distinct from them. If it\nis identical with them, then they are not in fact many, but one, since\nthey are all identical with some one thing. On the other hand, if that\nthing is distinct from them, then they do not occupy the highest level\nafter all. Instead, that thing is greater than they are. Either way,\nthere can be only one being occupying the highest level of all. \n\nAnselm concludes the first four chapters by summarizing his\nresults: \n\nHe then goes on (in chapters 5–65) to derive the attributes that must\nbelong to the being who fits this description. But before we look at\nAnselm’s understanding of the divine attributes, we should turn to the\nfamous proof in the Proslogion.  \n\nLooking back on the sixty-five chapters of complicated argument in the\nMonologion, Anselm found himself wishing for a simpler way to\nestablish all the conclusions he wanted to prove. As he tells us in the\npreface to the Proslogion, he wanted to find  \n\nThat “single argument” is the one that appears in chapter\n2 of the Proslogion. (Or so it is commonly said: but some interpreters\nunderstand the “one argument” as extending into chapter 3, and\nHolopainen 1996 argues that it is the formula “that than\nwhich a greater cannot be thought.”) \n\nThe proper way to state Anselm’s argument is a matter of dispute, and\nany detailed statement of the argument will beg interpretative\nquestions.  But on a fairly neutral or consensus reading of the\nargument (which I shall go on to reject), Anselm’s argument goes like\nthis. God is “that than which a greater cannot be\nthought”; in other words, he is a being so great, so full of\nmetaphysical oomph, that one cannot so much as conceive of a being who\nwould be greater than God. The Psalmist, however, tells us that\n“The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God’\n” (Psalm 14:1; 53:1). Is it possible to convince the fool that\nhe is wrong? It is. All we need is the characterization of God as\n“that than which a greater cannot be thought.” The fool\ndoes at least understand that definition. But whatever is understood\nexists in the understanding, just as the plan of a painting he has yet\nto execute already exists in the understanding of the painter. So that\nthan which a greater cannot be thought exists in the\nunderstanding. But if it exists in the understanding, it must also\nexist in reality. For it is greater to exist in reality than to exist\nmerely in the understanding. Therefore, if that than which a greater\ncan be thought existed only in the understanding, it would be possible\nto think of something greater than it (namely, that same being\nexisting in reality as well). It follows, then, that if that than\nwhich a greater cannot be thought existed only in the understanding,\nit would not be that than which a greater cannot be thought; and that,\nobviously, is a contradiction. So that than which a greater cannot be\nthought must exist in reality, not merely in the understanding. \n\nVersions of this argument have been defended and criticized by a\nsuccession of philosophers from Anselm’s time through the present day\n(see\n ontological arguments).\n Our concern here is with Anselm’s own version, the\ncriticism he encountered, and his response to that criticism. A monk\nnamed Gaunilo wrote a “Reply on Behalf of the Fool,” contending that\nAnselm’s argument gave the Psalmist’s fool no good reason at all to\nbelieve that that than which a greater cannot be thought exists in\nreality. Gaunilo’s most famous objection is an argument intended to be\nexactly parallel to Anselm’s that generates an obviously absurd\nconclusion. Gaunilo proposes that instead of “that than which a\ngreater cannot be thought” we consider “that island than\nwhich a greater cannot be thought.” We understand what that\nexpression means, so (following Anselm’s reasoning) the greatest\nconceivable island exists in our understanding. But (again following\nAnselm’s reasoning) that island must exist in reality as well; for if\nit did not, we could imagine a greater island – namely, one that\nexisted in reality – and the greatest conceivable island would not\nbe the greatest conceivable island after all. Surely, though, it is\nabsurd to suppose that the greatest conceivable island actually exists\nin reality. Gaunilo concludes that Anselm’s reasoning is\nfallacious. \n\nGaunilo’s counterargument is so ingenious that it stands out as by far\nthe most devastating criticism in his catalogue of Anselm’s errors.\nNot surprisingly, then, interpreters have read Anselm’s reply to\nGaunilo primarily in order to find his rejoinder to the Lost Island\nargument.  Sympathetic interpreters (such as Klima 2000 and Ward 2018) have offered\nways for Anselm to respond, but at least one commentator (Wolterstorff\n1993) argues that Anselm offers no such rejoinder, precisely because\nhe knew Gaunilo’s criticism was unanswerable but could not bring\nhimself to admit that fact. \n\nA more careful look at Anselm’s reply to Gaunilo, however, shows that\nAnselm offered no rejoinder to the Lost Island argument because he\nrejected Gaunilo’s interpretation of the original argument of the\nProslogion.  Gaunilo had understood the argument in the way I\nstated it above.  Anselm understood it quite differently.  In\nparticular, Anselm insists that the original argument did not rely on\nany general principle to the effect that a thing is greater when it\nexists in reality than when it exists only in the\nunderstanding.[1] \nAnd since that is the principle that does the mischief in Gaunilo’s\ncounterargument, Anselm sees no need to respond to the Lost Island\nargument in particular. \n\nCorrectly understood, Anselm says, the argument of the\nProslogion can be summarized as follows: Therefore, \n\nAnselm defends (1) by showing how we can form a conception of that\nthan which a greater cannot be thought on the basis of our\nexperience and understanding of those things than which a greater\ncan be thought.  For example, \n\nOnce we have formed this idea of that than which a greater cannot be\nthought, Anselm says, we can see that such a being has features that\ncannot belong to a possible but non-existent object – or, in\nother words, that (2) is true.  For example, a being that is capable\nof non-existence is less great than a being that exists necessarily.\nIf that than which a greater cannot be thought does not exist, it is\nobviously capable of non-existence; and if it is capable of\nnon-existence, then even if it were to exist, it would not be that\nthan which a greater cannot be thought after all.  So if that than\nwhich a greater cannot be thought can be thought – that is, if\nit is a possible being – it actually exists.  (This reading of\nthe argument of the Proslogion is developed at length in\nVisser and Williams 2008, chapter 5.) \n\nRecall that Anselm’s intention in the Proslogion was to offer\na single argument that would establish not only the existence of God\nbut also the various attributes that Christians believe God possesses.\nIf the argument of chapter 2 proved only the existence of God, leaving\nthe divine attributes to be established piecemeal as in the\nMonologion, Anselm would consider the Proslogion a\nfailure. But in fact the concept of that than which nothing greater can\nbe thought turns out to be marvelously fertile. God must, for example,\nbe omnipotent. For if he were not, we could conceive of a being greater\nthan he. But God is that than which no greater can be thought, so he\nmust be omnipotent. Similarly, God must be just, self-existent,\ninvulnerable to suffering, merciful, timelessly eternal, non-physical,\nnon-composite, and so forth. For if he lacked any of these qualities,\nhe would be less than the greatest conceivable being, which is\nimpossible.  \n\nThe ontological argument thus works as a sort of\ndivine-attribute-generating machine. Admittedly, though, the\nappearance of theoretical simplicity is somewhat misleading. The\n“single argument” produces conclusions about the divine attributes\nonly when conjoined with certain beliefs about what is greater or\nbetter. That is, the ontological argument tells us that God has\nwhatever characteristics it is better or greater to have than to lack,\nbut it does not tell us which characteristics those are. We must have\nsome independent way of identifying them before we can plug them into\nthe ontological argument and generate a full-blown conception of the\ndivine nature. Anselm identifies these characteristics in part by\nappeal to intuitions about value, in part by independent argument. To\nillustrate Anselm’s method, I shall examine his discussions of God’s\nimpassibility, timelessness, and simplicity. \n\nAccording to the doctrine of divine impassibility, God is invulnerable\nto suffering. Nothing can act upon him; he is in no way passive. He\ntherefore does not feel emotions, since emotions are states that one\nundergoes rather than actions one performs. Anselm does not find it\nnecessary to argue that impassibility is a perfection; he\nthinks it is perfectly obvious that “it is better to be …\nimpassible than not” (P 6), just as it is perfectly\nobvious that it is better to be just than not-just. His intuitions\nabout value are shaped by the Platonic-Augustinian tradition of which\nhe was a part. Augustine took from the Platonists the idea that the\nreally real things, the greatest and best of beings, are stable,\nuniform, and unchanging. He says in On Free Choice of the\nWill 2.10, “And you surely could not deny that the\nuncorrupted is better than the corrupt, the eternal than the temporal,\nand the invulnerable than the vulnerable”; his interlocutor\nreplies simply, “Could anyone?” Through Augustine (and\nothers) these ideas, and the conception of God to which they naturally\nlead, became the common view of Christian theologians for well over a\nmillennium. For Anselm, then, it is obvious that a being who is in no\nway passive, who cannot experience anything of which he is not himself\nthe origin, is better and greater than any being who can be acted upon\nby something outside himself. So God, being that than which nothing\ngreater can be thought, is wholly active; he is impassible. \n\nNotice that Augustine also found it obvious that the eternal is better\nthan the temporal. According to Plato’s Timaeus, time is a\n“moving image of eternity” (37d). It is a shifting and\nshadowy reflection of the really real. As later Platonists, including\nAugustine, develop this idea, temporal beings have their existence\npiecemeal; they exist only in this tiny sliver of a now, which is\nconstantly flowing away from them and passing into nothingness. An\neternal being, by contrast, is (to use my earlier description) stable,\nuniform, and unchanging. What it has, it always has; what it is, it\nalways is; what it does, it always does. So it seems intuitively\nobvious to Anselm that if God is to be that than which nothing greater\ncan be thought, he must be eternal. That is, he must be not merely\neverlasting, but outside time \naltogether.[2] \n\nIn addition to this strong intuitive consideration, Anselm at least\nhints at a further argument for the claim that it is better to be\neternal than temporal. He opens chapter 13 of the Proslogion\nby observing, “Everything that is at all enclosed in a place or time is\nless than that which is subject to no law of place or time” (P\n13). His idea seems to be that if God were in time (or in a place), he\nwould be bound by certain constraints inherent in the nature of time\n(or place). His discussion in Monologion 22 makes the problem\nclear: \n\nSo at least part of the reason for holding that God is timeless is that\nthe nature of time would impose constraints upon God, and of course it\nis better to be subject to no external constraints.  \n\nThe other part of the reason, though, is that if God were in place or\ntime he would have parts. But what is so bad about having\nparts? This question brings us naturally to the doctrine of divine\nsimplicity, which is simply the doctrine that God has no parts of any\nkind. Even for an Augustinian like Anselm, the claim that it is better\nto lack parts than to have them is less than intuitively compelling,\nso Anselm offers further arguments for that claim. In the\nProslogion he argues that “whatever is composed of\nparts is not completely one. It is in some sense a plurality and not\nidentical with itself, and it can be broken up either in fact or at\nleast in the understanding” (P 18). The argument in\nthe Monologion goes somewhat differently. “Every\ncomposite,” Anselm argues, “needs the things of which it\nis composed if it is to subsist, and it owes its existence to them,\nsince whatever it is, it is through them, whereas those things are not\nthrough it what they are” (M 17). The argument in\nthe Proslogion, then, seeks to relate simplicity to the\nintuitive considerations that identify what is greatest and best with\nwhat is stable, uniform, and unchanging; the argument in the\nMonologion, by contrast, seeks to show that simplicity is\nnecessary if God is to be – as the theistic proofs have already\nestablished – the ultimate source of his own goodness and existence. \n\nAnselm’s success in generating a whole host of divine attributes\nthrough the ontological argument does present him with a\nproblem.  He must show that the attributes are consistent with\neach other – in other words, that it is possible for one and the\nsame being to have all of them. For example, there seems at first\nglance to be a conflict between justice and omnipotence. If God is\nperfectly just, he cannot lie. But if God is omnipotent, how can there\nbe something he cannot do? Anselm’s solution is to explain that\nomnipotence does not mean the ability to do everything; instead, it\nmeans the possession of unlimited power. Now the so-called\n“ability” or “power” to lie is not really a\npower at all; it is a kind of weakness. Being omnipotent, God has no\nweakness. So it turns out that omnipotence actually entails\nthe inability to lie.  \n\nAnother apparent contradiction is between God’s mercy and his\njustice. If God is just, he will surely punish the wicked as they\ndeserve. But because he is merciful, he spares the wicked. Anselm\ntries to resolve this apparent contradiction by appeal to God’s\ngoodness. It is better, he says, for God “to be good both to the\ngood and to the wicked than to be good only to the good, and it is\nbetter to be good to the wicked both in punishing and in sparing them\nthan to be good only in punishing them” (P 9). So God’s\nsupreme goodness requires that he be both just and merciful. But\nAnselm is not content to resolve the apparent tension between justice\nand mercy by appealing to some other attribute, goodness, that entails\nboth justice and mercy; he goes on to argue that justice itself\nrequires mercy. Justice to sinners obviously requires that God punish\nthem; but God’s justice to himself requires that he exercise\nhis supreme goodness in sparing the wicked. “Thus,” Anselm\nsays to God, “in saving us whom you might justly destroy\n… you are just, not because you give us our due, but because you\ndo what is fitting for you who are supremely good” (P\n10). In spite of these arguments, Anselm acknowledges that there is a\nresidue of mystery here: \n\nIn other words, the philosopher can trace the conceptual relations\namong goodness, justice, and mercy, and show that God not only can but\nmust have all three; but no human reasoning can hope to show why God\ndisplays his justice and mercy in precisely the ways in which he\ndoes. (For a detailed and sympathetic reconstruction of Anselm’s arguments concerning justice and mercy, see Mann 2019.) \n\nIn On Freedom of Choice (De libertate arbitrii)\nAnselm defines freedom of choice as “the power to preserve rectitude of\nwill for its own sake” (DLA 3). He explores the notion of\nrectitude of will most thoroughly in On Truth (De\nveritate), so in order to understand the definition of freedom of\nchoice, we must look first at Anselm’s discussion of truth. Truth\nis a much broader notion for Anselm than for us; he speaks of truth not\nonly in statements and opinions but also in the will, actions, the\nsenses, and even the essences of things. In every case, he argues,\ntruth consists in correctness or “rectitude.” Rectitude, in turn, is\nunderstood teleologically; a thing is correct whenever it is or does\nwhatever it ought, or was designed, to be or do. For example,\nstatements are made for the purpose of “signifying that what-is is”\n(DV 2). A statement therefore is correct (has rectitude) when,\nand only when, it signifies that what-is is. So Anselm holds a\ncorrespondence theory of truth, but it is a somewhat unusual\ncorrespondence theory. Statements are true when they correspond to\nreality, but only because corresponding to reality is what statements\nare for. That is, statements (like anything else) are true\nwhen they do what they were designed to do; and what they were designed\nto do, as it happens, is to correspond to reality.  \n\nTruth in the will also turns out to be rectitude, again understood\nteleologically. Rectitude of will means willing what one ought to will\nor (in other words) willing that for the sake of which one was given a\nwill. So, just as the truth or rectitude of a statement is the\nstatement’s doing what statements were made to do, the truth or\nrectitude of a will is the will’s doing what wills were made to do. In\nDV 12 Anselm connects rectitude of will to both justice and\nmoral evaluation. In a broad sense of ‘just’, whatever is\nas it ought to be is just. Thus, an animal is just when it blindly\nfollows its appetites, because that is what animals were meant to do.\nBut in the narrower sense of ‘just’, in which justice is\nwhat deserves moral approval and injustice is what deserves reproach,\njustice is best defined as “rectitude of will preserved for its own\nsake” (DV 12). Such rectitude requires that agents perceive\nthe rectitude of their actions and will them for the sake of that\nrectitude. Anselm takes the second requirement to exclude both coercion\nand “being bribed by an extraneous reward” (DV 12). For an\nagent who is coerced into doing what is right is not willing rectitude\nfor its own sake; and similarly, an agent who must be bribed to do what\nis right is willing rectitude for the sake of the bribe, not for the\nsake of rectitude. \n\nSince, as we have already seen, Anselm will define freedom as “the\npower to preserve rectitude of will for its own sake,” the arguments of\nOn Truth imply that freedom is also the capacity for justice\nand the capacity for moral praiseworthiness. Now it is both necessary\nand sufficient for justice, and thus for praiseworthiness, that an\nagent wills what is right, knowing it to be right, because it is right.\nThat an agent wills what is right because it is right entails that he\nis neither compelled nor bribed to perform the act. Freedom, then, must\nbe neither more nor less than the power to perform acts of that\nsort. \n\nThus Anselm takes it to be obvious that freedom is a power for\nsomething: its purpose is to preserve rectitude of will for its own\nsake. God and the good angels cannot sin, but they are still free,\nbecause they can (and do) preserve rectitude of will for its own sake.\nIn fact, they are freer than those who can sin: “someone who has what\nis fitting and expedient in such a way that he cannot lose it is freer\nthan someone who has it in such a way that he can lose it and be\nseduced into what is unfitting and inexpedient” (DLA 1). It\nobviously follows, as Anselm points out, that freedom of choice neither\nis nor entails the power to sin; God and the good angels have freedom\nof choice, but they are incapable of sinning.  \n\nBut if free choice is the power to hold on to what is fitting and\nexpedient, and it is not the power to sin, does it make any sense to\nsay that the first human beings and the rebel angels sinned through\nfree choice? Anselm’s reply to this question is both subtle and\nplausible. In order to be able to preserve rectitude of will for its\nown sake, an agent must be able to perform an action that has its\nultimate origin in the agent him- or herself rather than in some\nexternal source. (For convenience I will refer to that power as “the\npower for self-initiated action.”) Any being that has freedom of\nchoice, therefore, will thereby have the power for self-initiated\naction. The first human beings and the rebel angels sinned through an\nexercise of their power for self-initiated action, and so it is\nappropriate to say that they sinned through free choice. \nNonetheless, free choice does not entail the power to sin. For free\nchoice can be perfected by something else, as yet unspecified, that\nrenders it incapable of sinning. \n\nIn On the Fall of the Devil (De casu diaboli)\nAnselm extends his account of freedom and sin by discussing the first\nsin of the angels. In order for the angels to have the power to\npreserve rectitude of will for its own sake, they had to have both a\nwill for justice and a will for happiness. If God had given them only a\nwill for happiness, they would have been necessitated to will whatever\nthey thought would make them happy. Their willing of happiness would\nhave had its ultimate origin in God and not in the angels themselves.\nSo they would not have had the power for self-initiated action, which\nmeans that they would not have had free choice. The same thing would\nhave been true, mutatis mutandis, if God had given them only\nthe will for justice. \n\nSince God gave them both the will for happiness and the will for justice, however, they had the power for\nself-initiated action. Whether they chose to subject their wills for\nhappiness to the demands of justice or to ignore the demands of justice\nin the interest of happiness, that choice had its ultimate origin in\nthe angels; it was not received from God. The rebel angels chose to\nabandon justice in an attempt to gain happiness for themselves, whereas\nthe good angels chose to persevere in justice even if it meant less\nhappiness. God punished the rebel angels by taking away their\nhappiness; he rewarded the good angels by granting them all the\nhappiness they could possibly want. For this reason, the good angels\nare no longer able to sin. Since there is no further happiness left for\nthem to will, their will for happiness can no longer entice them to\noverstep the bounds of justice. Thus Anselm finally explains what it is\nthat perfects free choice so that it becomes unable to sin. \n\nLike the fallen angels, the first human beings willed happiness in\npreference to justice. By doing so they abandoned the will for justice\nand became unable to will justice for its own sake. Apart from divine\ngrace, then, fallen human beings cannot help but sin. Anselm claims\nthat we are still free, because we continue to be such that if we had\nrectitude of will, we could preserve it for its own sake; but we cannot\nexercise our freedom, since we no longer have the rectitude of\nwill to preserve. (Whether fallen human beings also retain the power\nfor self-initiated action apart from divine grace is a tricky question,\nand one I do not propose to answer here.)  \n\nSo the restoration of human beings to the justice they were intended\nto enjoy requires divine grace. But even more is needed than God’s\nrestoration of the will for justice. In Cur Deus Homo\n(Why God Became A Human Being, or Why the God-Man?) Anselm famously attempts to\nshow on purely rational grounds that the debt incurred by human sin\ncould be suitably discharged, and the affront to God’s infinite\ndignity could be suitably rectified, only if one who was both fully\ndivine and fully human took it upon himself to offer his own life on\nour behalf.","contact.mail":"twilliam@cas.usf.edu","contact.domain":"cas.usf.edu"}]
