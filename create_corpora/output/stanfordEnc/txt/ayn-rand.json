Early in her career she also wrote\nshort stories, plays, and screenplays. Rand’s first and most\nautobiographical novel, We the Living (1936), set in the\nSoviet Union, was published only after many rejections, owing to\nwidespread sympathy for the Soviet “experiment” among the\nintellectuals of the day. We the Living was quickly followed\nby the dystopian novel, Anthem (1938), written as “a\nkind of rest” from work on her next major novel, The\nFountainhead (1943). The Fountainhead, also published\nafter many rejections because of its individualism, and largely panned\nby critics, soon became a best-seller by word of mouth. The\nFountainhead brought Rand international fame, and Atlas\nShrugged (1957) sealed this fame. By 1958, Rand’s novels,\nincreasingly philosophical, had won her ideas a sufficiently devoted\nfollowing for her to form, in association with psychologist Nathaniel\nBranden (with whom she later broke), an official\n“Objectivist” philosophical movement, complete with\njournals and lecture courses. For all her popularity, however, only a\nfew professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a\nresult, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in\nnon-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the\nbibliography reflects this fact. We discuss the main reasons for her\nrejection by most professional philosophers in the first section. Our\ndiscussion of Rand’s philosophical views, especially her\nmoral-political views, draws from both her non-fiction and her\nfiction, since her views cannot be accurately interpreted or evaluated\nwithout doing so.\n\nIn Rand’s own words, her first and greatest love, her\n“life purpose”, was “the creation of the kind of\nworld … that represents human perfection”, while her\ninterest in philosophical knowledge was “only” for the\nsake of this purpose (Journal entry for 4 May 1946; in 1997:\n 479).[1]\n Nevertheless, her interest in philosophical knowledge continued long\nafter she had created this world in her magnum opus, Atlas\nShrugged, her last work of fiction. In her non-fiction, Rand\ndeveloped a conception of metaphysical realism, rationality, ethical\negoism (rational self-interest), individual rights,\nlaissez-faire capitalism, and art, and applied her philosophy\nto social issues. She wrote polemical, philosophical essays, often in\nresponse to questions by fans of Atlas Shrugged and The\nFountainhead; lectured on college campuses; and gave radio and\ntelevision interviews. In her own words, her philosophy,  \nin essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own\nhappiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive\nachievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\n(Rand 1957 [1992]: Afterword)  \nCapitalism, “the unknown ideal”, is for her the only\npolitical-economic system compatible with this philosophy because it\nis the only system based on respect for human beings as ends in\nthemselves. The free-market libertarian political movement, though\nlargely disowned by Rand, drew—and draws—great inspiration\nfrom her moral defense of the minimal state, that is, the state whose\nonly raison d’être is protection of individual\nrights. \nWhereas Rand’s ideas and mode of presentation make Rand popular\nwith many non-academics, they lead to the opposite outcome with\nacademics. She developed some of her views in response to questions\nfrom her readers, but seldom took the time to defend them against\npossible objections or to reconcile them with the views expressed in\nher novels. Her philosophical essays lack the self-critical, detailed\nstyle of analytic philosophy, or any serious attempt to consider\npossible objections to her views. Her polemical style, often\ncontemptuous tone, and the dogmatism and cult-like behavior of many of\nher fans also suggest that her work is not worth taking\n seriously.[2]\n Further, understanding her views requires reading her fiction, but\nher fiction is not to everyone’s taste. It does not help that\nshe often dismisses other philosophers’ views on the basis of\ncursory readings and conversations with a few philosophers and with\nher young philosophy student acolytes. Some contemporary philosophers\nreturn the compliment by dismissing her work contemptuously on the\nbasis of hearsay. Some who do read her work point out that her\narguments too often do not support her conclusions. This estimate is\nshared even by many who find her conclusions and her criticisms of\ncontemporary culture, morality, and politics original and insightful.\nIt is not surprising, then, that she is either mentioned in passing,\nor not mentioned at all, in the entries that discuss current\nphilosophical thought about\n virtue ethics,\n egoism,\n rights,\n libertarianism, or\n markets.\n (Readers may also find the entry on\n Nozick’s political philosophy\n to be of interest.) We present specific criticisms of her arguments\nand claims below, in the relevant sections of this entry. \nAyn Rand was born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, to a bourgeois Jewish\nfamily in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 2 February 1905. A witness to the\nRussian Revolution and civil war, Rand opposed both the Communists and\nthe Tsarists. She majored in history, but the social science program\nin which she was enrolled at Petrograd State University included\nphilosophy, law, and philology. Her teachers emphasized—as she\nherself later did—the importance of developing systematic\nconnections among different areas of thought (Sciabarra 2013).\nRand’s formal philosophical education included ancient\nphilosophy (especially Plato and Aristotle), logic, philosophical\npsychology, Marxism-Leninism, and non-Marxist political thought. But\nshe was evidently also exposed to Hegelian and Nietzschean ideas,\nwhich blossomed during this period (known as the Russian Silver Age),\nand read a great deal of Friedrich Nietzsche on her own. After\ngraduating from Petrograd State University in 1924, an interest in\nscreenwriting led her to enroll in the State Institute for\nCinematography. On the literary side, she studied the great Russian\nnovelists and poets, but fell in love with Victor Hugo, to whose\ninfluence she owes the “Romantic Realism” of her\nnovels. \nIn 1925 Rand succeeded in obtaining permission to visit relatives in\nthe United States; hating the Soviet system, she left with no\nintention of returning. After six months with relatives in Chicago,\nshe made her way to Hollywood where, on her second day, a fortuitous\nencounter with Cecil B. DeMille led to a job as a script reader, and\nlater as a screenplay writer. The next week she had another fortuitous\nencounter, this time with the actor Frank O’Connor, whom she\nmarried in 1929. She was married to him till his death in 1979. She\nadopted the pen name Ayn Rand to (it is thought) protect her family\nback in Russia, although she also told the New York Evening\nPost in 1936 that “Rand” was an abbreviation of her\nRussian surname. \nRand and her husband moved permanently to New York City in 1951, where\nshe became involved with, and was influenced by, the circle of mostly\nNew-York-based intellectuals involved in the revival of classical\nliberalism, such as the economic journalist Henry Hazlitt, the\nAustrian economist Ludwig von Mises, and the Canadian-American\nnovelist, literary critic, and political philosopher Isabel Paterson.\nRand also studied, and was a great admirer of, the Lockean philosophy\nof the American founding. Rand lived and worked in New York City until\nher death in 1982. \nRand holds that philosophy, like all forms of knowledge and\nachievement, is important only because it is necessary for living a\ngood human life and creating a world conducive to living such a life.\nPhilosophy supplies the most fundamental cognitive and normative\nabstractions which, respectively, identify and evaluate what is.\nEveryone, according to Rand, needs a philosophy and is guided by at\nleast an implicit one (1982a: ch. 1). Her novels express her belief\nthat if our philosophy is more or less correct, our lives will be more\nor less successful, if our philosophy is wildly off the mark, our\nlives will be disastrous. Philosophy thus has an urgent, practical\nimportance. But unlike Marx, her philosophical and political antipode,\nRand thinks that social change has to start with a moral revolution\nwithin each individual and the spread of the right ideas and ideals\nthrough rational discourse and the inspiration of art. \nRand’s ideal human being appears, in varying degrees of\ndevelopment, in all her novels; her ideal world appears in Atlas\nShrugged. Her novels feature striking, complex plots with subtle\npsychological explorations of her characters’ emotions and\nthoughts, and philosophical reflections that rarely lose sight of the\ndramatic context. Like many famous Russian novelists, especially\nDostoevsky, whom she recognized as a great psychologist, Rand also\nuses long speeches to lay out her philosophy, a device that has both\nits supporters and its detractors. She described Atlas\nShrugged as a “stunt novel” and a murder\nmystery—the murder of the human soul by a collectivist culture.\nBy “soul”, however, she meant not an immortal substance\nthat survives the death of the body—she is not a dualist in any\naspect of her philosophy—but the mind, or the human spirit that\ncelebrates life on this earth. She took a familiar phenomenon and\nliterary trope—a workers’ strike—and turned it on\nits head to show what happens when “the men of\nmind”—scientists, philosophers, industrialists,\nentrepreneurs, writers—the “prime movers” of a\nsociety—go on strike. It also purports to show how the wrong\nmetaphysics can lead to the wrong ethics and thus to disastrous\npersonal choices and a disastrous political and economic system, and\nhow the right philosophy is needed for the rebirth of the soul and the\nrebuilding of the world. Her protagonists are not knights on white\nsteeds rescuing damsels in distress, or swordsmen who can fight off a\ndozen enemies single-handed, but men and women in the\nmid-20th century industrial America of steel mills,\nskyscrapers, and glimmering highways: women who run transcontinental\nrailroads and men who revolutionize architecture or (long before clean\nenergy became a cause célèbre) build a motor\npowered by static electricity to produce limitless, clean energy. Her\nnovels show the importance of striving to be the best we can be: \nDo not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the\nhopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the\nnot-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely\nfrustration for the life you deserved, but never have been able to\nreach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you\ndesired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible….\n(Atlas Shrugged, 1957 [1992]: 983). \nHer novels inspire readers because they present heroes of unbreached\nintegrity, heroes who lead colorful and remarkable lives and succeed\nnot in spite of, but because of, their uncompromising virtue. This\nestimate of their virtue is not, of course, shared by all: many\nreaders find her characters wooden, her writing stilted, and her\nethical and political views misguided. \nRand paid tribute to Aristotle, whom she considered the greatest of\nall philosophers, in the titles she gave to the three Parts of\nAtlas Shrugged (Non-Contradiction, Either-Or, A is\nA) and to one of the chapters (The Immovable Movers). While\nshe differed sharply from Nietzsche on many issues, including\nrationality, free will, and individual rights, his influence is\nevident in her provocative, often aphoristic, point-counterpoint\nwriting style, as well as in her “transvaluation” of\ntraditional values and her powerful affirmation of life and joy and\nthe spirit of youth. In the Introduction to the 25th\nAnniversary edition of The Fountainhead, she stated that the\nnovel’s sense of life is best conveyed by a quotation from\nNietzsche’s Beyond Good and Evil: “The noble soul\nhas reverence for itself”. (For The\nFountainhead’s partly sympathetic and partly critical\nengagement with Nietzsche’s ideas, see Hunt 2006.) \nFundamental to Rand’s outlook—so fundamental that she\nderives the name of her philosophical system,\n“Objectivism”, from it—is a trichotomy among three\ncategories: the intrinsic, the subjective, and the\nobjective (ITOE: 52–54; Rand 1965: 13–23). An\nintrinsic phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on factors\nexternal to the mind; a subjective phenomenon is one whose nature\ndepends wholly on the mind; and an objective phenomenon is defined,\nvariously, as that which depends on the relation between a living\nentity’s nature (including the nature of its mind) and its\nenvironment, or as that which depends on the relation between a\nproperly functioning (rational) mind and extramental reality.\nCommentators are divided over the best way to interpret Rand’s\nviews on this issue. \nRand holds that there is a widespread tendency to ignore the third\ncategory or to assimilate it to the second, thus setting up a false\ndichotomy between the intrinsic and the subjective. On Rand’s\nview, many of the fundamental questions of philosophy, from the\nexistence of universals to the nature of value, involve fruitless\ndebates over the false alternative “intrinsic or\nsubjective?” in cases where the phenomenon in question is\nneither intrinsic nor subjective, but rather objective. \nIf ethics is the branch of philosophy concerned with practice, then in\na sense all of Rand’s philosophy is ethics, for Rand stresses\n“the supremacy of actual living over all other\nconsiderations”, and insists that philosophy needs to be\n“brought up to the realm of actual\nliving”—adding “I say intentionally brought\nup to it, not down” (Journal entry for 15 May 1934, p.\n72; in Rand 1997: 73). Consequently, Rand regularly concerns herself\nwith the practical implications and social relevance not only of moral\nand political philosophy, but likewise of the seemingly more arcane\nstrata of metaphysics and epistemology—as when she identifies\nerrors in concept-formation as one of the roots of racism, or\nmind-body dualism as a root of the dichotomy between economic and\npersonal freedom. This approach likewise reflects Rand’s\nemphasis on integrating each piece of information into the total\ncontext of one’s knowledge, and her consequent hostility to\ncompartmentalization. \nRand’s conviction of the vital practical importance of abstract\ntheory may help to explain the passionately polemical nature of her\nphilosophical writing (which some readers find inspiring and others\nhyperbolic and off-putting), although Nietzsche’s influence, as well\nas the influence of her Marxist-Leninist education also probably play\na role. Rand also tended—perhaps owing in part to the same two\ninfluences—to regard philosophical errors as revelatory of the\npsychological flaws of their authors. \nFor a more in-depth presentation of Rand’s views on epistemology\nand metaphysics, please see the\n supplement on Epistemology and Metaphysics\n  \nEthics  \nis a code of values to guide man’s choices and actions—the\nchoices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his\nlife. (1961b: 13)  \nBefore we can decide which code of values we should accept, we need to\nask why we need a code of values at all. Rand claims that no\nphilosopher before her has provided a scientific answer to\nthis question, and so none has provided a satisfactory ethics. \nRand starts by describing value or “the good”, in\nclassical fashion, as the object of pursuit: “that which one\nacts to gain and/or keep” (1961b: 16). Thus, the concept of\nvalue presupposes the concept of “an entity capable of acting to\nachieve a goal in the face of an alternative”—and the\nbasic alternative facing any living entity is life or death (1961b:\n16). It is the conditional nature of life that gives rise to values,\nnot just human values, but values as such. As she puts it:  \nMetaphysically, life is the only phenomenon that is an end in\nitself: a value gained and kept by a constant process of action.\n(1961b: 18)  \nSurvival is the organism’s ultimate value, the “final goal\nor end to which all [its] lesser goals are the means”, and the\nstandard of all its other values: “that which furthers its life\nis the good, that which threatens it is the evil” (pp.\n16–17). The same, suitably modified, applies to human beings.\nLife is the standard and goal of all genuine human values, in the\nsense that all of them—from food to philosophy to fine art to\nethics—must be explained and justified as requirements of human\nsurvival. “Ethics is an objective, metaphysical necessity of\nman’s survival” (p. 24). Thus,  \n[t]he standard of value of the Objectivist ethics … is\nman’s life, or: that which is required for man’s\nsurvival qua man, (1961b: 25)  \nthat is,  \nthe terms, methods, conditions and goals required for the survival of\na rational being through the whole of his lifespan—in all those\naspects of existence which are open to his choice. (1961b: 27)  \nTo choose to live is to accept one’s “own\nlife” as one’s “ethical\npurpose”. \nRand’s metaphysical arguments make three points central to her\naxiology and ethics. (1) All living entities have values, not only\nhuman beings, and only living entities have values: life necessitates\nvalue, and value depends on life. (2) An entity’s values are\ndetermined by its objective life-needs, that is, by the requirements\nof survival for entities of its kind, and ethics is a requirement of\nhuman survival. (3) Thus, values are neither intrinsic properties of\nthings, nor subjective, neither free-floating Platonic entities, nor\nmere matters of preference, time, or culture. Rather, values are\nrelational or objective, dependent on the nature of the valuing entity\nand the nature of its environment.  \nRand supports the first point by arguing that the concept of value\nentails the concept of life:  \nepistemologically, the concept of “value” is genetically\ndependent upon and derived from the antecedent concept of\n“life”. (1961b: 18)  \nShe asks the reader to  \nimagine an immortal, indestructible robot, an entity which moves\nand acts, but which cannot be affected by anything, which cannot be\nchanged in any respect, which cannot be damaged, injured or destroyed.\n(1961b: 16)  \nSuch an entity, she concludes, cannot have values. \nThe problem with this argument is that all it shows is that an entity\nthat cannot be destroyed or harmed cannot have values, and not that a\nnon-living entity cannot have values. Unlike the robot of this\nexample, real robots can be damaged or destroyed, by external\nas well as internal events. What it means for them to be damaged or\ndestroyed is that they cannot perform their functions well, or at\nall. Hence they can, quite straightforwardly, be said to have\n values.[3]\nTo take this into account, Rand would have to say that for an entity\nthat has a function, values are determined by what it needs to\nfunction (well), and that the function of living beings is to survive\n(well). Hence she can still maintain that for living things, values\nare determined by its objective life-needs, hence that values are\nobjective, and that ethics is a requirement of a proper human\nsurvival.  \nRand’s naturalism, and her rejection of intrinsicism and\nsubjectivism in favor of objectivism, anticipate recent naturalisms\nand echo Aristotle’s argument, against both the Platonist and\nthe subjectivist, that “the good” must always be\ngood-for-something. Her conception of the function of\nmorality is notable both for its affinity to, and its difference from,\nThomas Hobbes’ conception: like Hobbes, Rand sees morality as a\nnecessary means to long-term survival, but unlike Hobbes, she does not\nsee morality as requiring a contract or even as a fundamentally social\naffair. The need for morality, according to Rand, is dictated by our\nnature as creatures that must think and produce to survive; hence we\nwould need morality even on a desert island. There is, however, no\nduty to survive; morality is based on a hypothetical imperative: if\nyou choose to live, then you must value your own long-term survival as\nan ultimate end, and morality as a necessary means to it. If asked why the\nchoice to live commits you to your own long-term survival rather than\nsome other ultimate end (such as, for example, the greatest happiness\nof the greatest number (Nozick 1971), or becoming worthy of eternal\nlife in heaven), the only answer is: because any other ultimate end, if\nconsistently adhered to, would lead to death. \nRand’s ethics is thus firmly teleological, this-worldly, and\nfoundationalist. Virtue is “the act by which one gains/and or\nkeeps” values in light of a recognition of certain facts (1961b:\n27, 28); it “is not an end in itself … not its own\nreward” (1957 [1992]: 939). A fact central to a\n“scientific” ethics is that reason is the chief\nindispensable human tool of survival, and we exercise reason by\nchoice. Hence rationality is the fundamental moral virtue, a virtue\nimplicated in all the other virtues, including productiveness\n (Section 2.4 below).  Rand is widely credited by Objectivists (Peikoff 1991; Binswanger\n1990, 1992; Kelley & Thomas 1999—see Other Internet\nResources; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006) with having solved the\nis-ought problem by showing that morality is essential for long-term\nsurvival as a rational being, and so anyone who chooses to live ought\nto be moral (1961b: 19). But if the choice to live is itself a moral\nchoice, in the sense that we ought to choose to live, then the\nargument proceeds from an ought to an ought, not from an is to an\nought. On the other hand, if the choice to live is a non-moral choice\n(an idea that’s hard to reconcile with Rand’s general view\nthat all significant choices are moral choices), then suicide can\nnever be wrong, even if it is done for cowardly, irresponsible, or\nunjust reasons, a view that is obviously incoherent (King 1984 and\nNarveson 1998 criticize this and other aspects of Rand’s moral\nviews).  Again, if morality is needed only for long-term survival, and\nchoosing death is not immoral, then a suicide-bomber does no wrong in\nkilling innocent people. But people don’t lose their rights just\nbecause their killer has decided to kill himself. Darryl Wright seeks\nto save something of the commonsense view that the suicide-bomber acts\nwrongly by arguing that his choice to die without good reason\n“corresponds to a real defect or corruption” in him\n(Wright 2011: 26–29). But this verdict contradicts the premise\nthat choosing death is not immoral. For if the choice expresses a\ncorruption in the character of the suicide-bomber, then the choice\nitself is immoral. Moreover, this response leaves untouched the most\nimportant criticism of the suicide-bomber’s actions: that he\nviolates other people’s rights by using them as mere means to\nhis own (wicked) ends.  More fundamentally, the very idea of morality resting on the\nchoice to live is questionable (Long 2000, Badhwar 2001). Most of us\nrarely, if ever, make a choice to live: we live by default. By giving\nus desires for food and water, for pleasure and security, Nature gives\nus, as she gives other animals, the implicit desire to stay\nalive. Perhaps the most dramatic evidence is the existence of feral\nchildren, children who have managed to stay alive for years in the\ncompany of wild animals. When we grow up, the only time we seriously\nask ourselves if we want to live or die is when living requires an\neffort on our part, such as in a grave illness, or deep depression, or\nemergency. But we start learning the difference between right and\nwrong (for example, don’t hit others, don’t grab their\nthings, and so on) long before we ever consider whether to live or\ndie. A deeper reflection on morality begins when we mature and start\nasking ourselves what constitutes happiness and a worthwhile life. But\nthis is an inherently moral question to which the answers are\ninherently moral or immoral.   Let let us now return to the question of how we should understand\nthe relationship between long-term survival and survival as a rational\nbeing—the life “proper to a rational being” (Rand\n1961b: 27). Is a life proper to a rational being a necessary means,\nand only a necessary means, to literal, long-term survival? Or is such\na life itself the ultimate goal, the kind of survival worth having?\nAgain, what are we to make of the many passages in which Rand states\nthat the ultimate goal is one’s own happiness? \nSome of Rand’s statements suggest that she had only one,\nconsistent ethical view: the ultimate goal is the individual’s\nown survival; the only way to survive long-term, i.e., over a complete\nlife-span, is to live by the standard of man’s life as a\nrational being, which means: to live morally; and happiness is the\npsychological “result, reward and concomitant” (p. 32) of\nliving thus.  Many of Rand’s commentators follow her in holding\nthat there is only one consistent view, while disagreeing on the right\ninterpretation of it (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000;\nPeikoff 1991; Bidinotto 1994—see Other Internet Resources; Hunt\n1999; Kelley & Thomas 1999—see Other Internet Resources;\nGotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006). Others (Mack 1984, 2003; Badhwar\n1999, 2001; Long 2000) argue that Rand’s writings actually allow\nof two, if not three, mutually incompatible views of the ultimate\ngoal, and our task is to see which of these is the dominant or most\nplausible view. The three views are: survival, survival qua\nrational being, and happiness in the ancient Aristotelian sense of\nflourishing or eudaimonia. In the rest of Section 2, we will\npresent the textual evidence for each of these views of the final\ngoal, and the common objections to them, in turn. \nAll three views are, of course, egoist, in that the primary or sole\nintended beneficiary of morality is supposed to be the moral agent\nherself. But some of the criticisms usually levied at egoism lose some\nof their force when directed at the second and third views. \nThe survivalist view holds that just as literal survival is the\nultimate value for other living entities, so it is for human beings\n(Kelley & Thomas 1999; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000). Survival is the\nsource and final goal of all the actions of an entity, that which\ngives point to all its other values. For human beings, morality and\nhappiness are both instrumental means to survival. The vicious can\n“achieve their goals [only] for the range of a moment”, as\nevidenced by “any criminal or any dictatorship” (1961b:\n26). \n“Non-survivalists” make the following objections:  Like Hobbes, Rand rightly points out that if everyone or most\npeople were to start preying on each other, then no one would survive\nfor long—literally, and that generations of predators\nwould end up destroying or driving away the producers, and thus\ndestroying themselves (Anthem and Atlas\nShrugged). But this doesn’t show that a few predators in a\nsociety of producers cannot survive by predation. Indeed, Rand herself\nsometimes acknowledges that evil people can survive by free-riding\n(“hitch-hiking”, as she calls it) on rational, productive\npeople: \n  If some men attempt to survive by means of brute force or fraud\n  … it still remains true that their survival is made possible\n  only by their victims, only by the men who choose to think and to\n  produce the goods which they, the looters, are seizing. (1961b:\n  25) In “Man’s Rights”, Rand explains an\nindividual’s right to his own life as  \n  the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a\n  rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and\n  the enjoyment of his own life. (1963b: 93 and 1967a: 321–22)\n   \n“Life” here is explicated in terms of not only continued\nsurvival but also of fulfillment and enjoyment.  \nFor all these reasons, a more plausible interpretation of Rand’s\nview is that morality is required for surviving qua human being, that\nis, for living a life proper to a human being. \nJust as the standard of value is survival qua human\nbeing, so the ultimate goal is one’s own survival\nqua human being. To accept this standard and goal is to\naccept (i) the three cardinal values of reason, purpose (or\npurposiveness) and self-esteem as not only “the means to”\nbut also “the realization of one’s ultimate value,\none’s own life” (1961b: 27), and (ii) the three\n“corresponding virtues” of rationality, productiveness,\nand pride. These values are means to one’s life insofar as they\nfurther one’s life as a rational being, and they realize it\ninsofar as they express the value we place on our lives. \nWhat it means to value survival qua human being turns on the\nrelationship of the three cardinal values to the three virtues. Rand\noften states that virtue is only a means to value. But when she\nexplains how the three cardinal values “correspond” to\ntheir three virtues, she does not provide a means-end analysis\n(Badhwar 1999, 2001). Thus, she says: \nProductive work is the central purpose of a rational\nman’s life, the central value that integrates and determines the\nhierarchy of all his other values. Reason is the source, the\nprecondition of his productive work—pride is the result. (1961b:\n27) \nThe virtue of productiveness becomes the central example of purpose\n(one of the three cardinal values), reason (another cardinal value)\nbecomes its source, and the virtue of pride becomes its result. Rand\nalso defines rationality, which is “the basic virtue”, in\nterms of  \nthe recognition and acceptance of reason as one’s only source of\nknowledge … and one’s only guide to action. (1961b: 28)\n \nBy this definition, being rational means valuing reason in thought,\nword, and deed, and realizing reason in one’s life means being\nrational: the virtue and the value entail each other. \nThis point generalizes to all the virtues and values. Further, since\nthe (cardinal) values are both “the means to” and\n“the realization of one’s ultimate value” (1961b:\n27), it follows that the (cardinal) virtues are also both the means to\nand the realization of one’s ultimate value: long-term survival\nqua human being. On this interpretation, to survive\nqua human being is none other than to lead a virtuous life in\nwhich one has realized one’s potential. \nBoth survivalists and eudaimonists, however, point out that\nthis conception of the final end contradicts Rand’s oft-repeated\nclaim that “Virtue is not an end in itself.…” In\naddition, eudaimonists make the following objections: \nIn addition, it is psychologically implausible to hold that we would\nchoose mere survival as an end even if we were deeply unhappy and saw\nno happiness in our future (cf. Wright 2019 20). \nEudaimonists hold that the dominant and/or more plausible\nview expressed in Rand’s writings is that happiness—a\nhappy life—is the ultimate value, where a happy life is\nunderstood as a life of emotional fulfillment in worthwhile goals and\nactivities. Happiness in this sense necessarily involves\nvirtue, but is not identical with virtue (Den Uyl &\nRasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000; Mack 1984; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Hunt\n1999; Long\n 2000).[4] \nHappiness is the existentially and psychologically “successful\nstate of life” (1961b: 27). As an emotion it is not simply a\npositive subjective state, as on some contemporary views, but an\nemotion that meets certain normative standards: “a state of\nnon-contradictory joy—a joy without penalty or guilt”,\nachievable only by  \nthe man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but\nrational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions.\n(1961b: 32)  \nHappiness is also a form of life-affirmation:  \nthe feeling of one’s blessing upon the whole of the earth, the\nfeeling of being in love with the fact that one exists and in this\nkind of world. (1957 [1992]: 105–6)  \nThus, happiness is an emotionally positive state of mind in an\nobjectively worthwhile state of life. \nRand holds that the pursuit of happiness is inseparable from the\nactivity of maintaining one’s life through the rational pursuit\nof rational goals (1961b: 29, 32). A virtuous life is, thus, essential\nto happiness. It is also a shield against soul-wracking unhappiness.\nJust as even great misfortunes don’t throw Aristotle’s\nvirtuous individual into misery, they don’t throw Rand’s\nheroes into misery. Even at the worst of times, the virtuous\nindividual’s pain “only goes down to a certain\npoint” (1943: 344), never touching the core of her being: the\nconviction that she is worthy and\ncapable of\n happiness.[5] \nIn keeping with their richer conception of the final end, Rand’s\nnovels also employ a richer conception of virtue as an integrated\nintellectual-emotional character trait to think, feel, and act in\ncertain ways, rather than simply as an act in light of a recognition\nof certain facts (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Her characters reveal their\nsouls not only in what they say or do, notice or fail to notice, focus\non or evade, on this or that occasion, but in their cognitive,\nemotional, and action dispositions, their style of being in the world.\nTheir actions show not only an intellectual commitment to the right\nbut a wholehearted “love of rectitude” (1957 [1992]:\n512). \nThis basically Aristotelian view of virtue goes hand-in-hand with a\nbasically Aristotelian view of emotions. Rand rejects the\nreason-emotion dichotomy as stemming, ultimately, from a false\nmind-body dichotomy. Emotions are neither raw feelings nor inherently\nirrational but, rather, automatized value-judgments:  \nestimates of that which furthers man’s values or threatens them\n… lightning calculators giving him the sum of his profit or\nloss. (1961b: 27)  \nEmotions provide instant guidance when circumstances do not permit\nreasoning everything out anew. But our emotions are only as good as\nour reason, because they are “programmed” by our reason.\nHence they can only be corrected by conscious reasoning, and in a\nconflict between reason and emotions, one must always side with the\n former.[6] \nEudaimonists argue that Rand’s vision of a virtuous and\nhappy life in her novels can be understood only as a form of\neudaimonism, even if she sometimes makes statements\ninconsistent with this vision. The chief objection\nto eudaimonism is that, by defining a happy life partly in\nterms of virtue, it employs an unconvincing conception of\nhappiness. The philosophical literature on happiness in this sense\n(usually called well-being) makes and answers this and other such\nobjections (Annas 1993, Haybron 2008, Badhwar 2014). \nThe chief Objectivist virtues are rationality, integrity, honesty\n(with self and others), justice, independence, productiveness, and\npride. Rationality,  \none’s total commitment … to the maintenance of a full\nmental focus in all issues, in all choices … to the fullest\nperception of reality within one’s power, (1961b: 28)  \nis the basic virtue of which the other virtues are aspects or\nderivatives. The virtues are thus united or reciprocal. Each virtue is\ndefined partly in terms of a recognition of, and appropriate\nresponsiveness to, some important fact or facts, a recognition and\nresponsiveness understood by the agent to be indispensable for\ngaining, maintaining, or expressing her ultimate value. For example,\nintegrity is “the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake\nyour consciousness” (1957 [1992]: 936), a recognition that is\nexpressed in loyalty to one’s rational values and convictions,\nespecially in the face of social pressures to surrender them (1961b:\n28; 1964a: 52, 80); honesty is “the recognition of the fact that\nyou cannot fake existence”, a recognition that is expressed in\ntruthfulness in thought and speech (1957 [1992]: 936–37); and\njustice is  \nthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men\nas you cannot fake the character of nature, … that every man\nmust be judged for what he is and treated\naccordingly…. (1957 [1992]: 937) \nConspicuous by their absence from Rand’s list of the cardinal\nvirtues are the “virtues of benevolence”, such as\nkindness, charity, generosity, and forgiveness. Rand states that\ncharity is not a major virtue or moral duty (1964b); likewise,\npresumably, kindness, generosity, and forgiveness. Whether, and how\nmuch, one should help others depends on their place in one’s\nrationally defined hierarchy of values, and on the particular\ncircumstances (whether they are worthy of help, what the likely\nconsequences are of helping them, and so on). The greater their value\nvis-à-vis one’s rational self-interest, the\ngreater the help that one should be willing to give, ceteris\nparibus. What is never morally appropriate is to make a\nsacrifice, that is, to surrender something of value to oneself for the\nsake of something of less or no value to oneself. Thus, it can never\nbe moral to knowingly risk one’s life for a stranger (unless, of\ncourse, one’s life is no longer worth living) or to court\nunhappiness for the happiness of another, whether stranger or\nfriend. It is appropriate to help a stranger only in an emergency, and\nonly when the risk to our own life or well-being is minimal (1963c:\n43–45).  This should not be taken to imply that helping a\nstranger is always morally optional, regardless of the\ncircumstances. Indeed, people who are “totally indifferent to\nanything living and would not lift a finger to help a man or a dog\nleft mangled by a hit-and-run driver” are\n“psychopaths” (1963c: 43–45) Rand makes even more\nconcessions to “common sense morality” when she states\nthat it’s good to help a neighbor going through a hard time till\nhe can get back on his own feet, if we can afford to and if we have no\nreason to think that he is undeserving. Charity understood thus is a\nvirtue because it is an expression of the generalized good will and\nrespect that all normal people have towards others as creatures who\nshare with them the capacity to value (1963c: 46–47). Nathaniel\nBranden tries to reconcile charity with egoism by declaring that the\nformer stems from a species-identification with another, such that, in\nrevering others, people “are revering their own life”. By\nacting charitably, people actualize this sense of kinship, without\nsacrificing their own well-being. \nThis last is true, but the desire to reduce all proper motivations to\negoistic motivations leads Branden (and Rand and many Objectivists) to\nignore the fact that charity is first and foremost profoundly\nother-regarding, prompted by another’s plight rather than\nconcern for one’s own self-actualization. The same is true of\ntrying to rescue a dog mangled by a hit-and-run driver, where the\negoistic motivation must be even weaker, since here there is no\nspecies-identification, but rather only a\n“genus-identification” with another sufferer. \nAt any rate, the argument from identification can also be used to\njustify charity towards strangers in non-emergency situations, for\nexample, towards those who are permanently disabled and unable to care\nfor themselves (Badhwar forthcoming). Rand concedes as much in\n“What is Capitalism?” (1965) where she argues that people\nwho are unable to work must rely on voluntary charity, thus implying\nthat it is proper for those who can afford it to support strangers in\nnon-emergency situations. And indeed, as recent scholarship has\nrevealed, in her own life Rand was often extremely generous, not only\ntowards friends and acquaintances, but also\nstrangers.[7] \nThe question arises why Rand thinks that charity, kindness etc. are\nnot major virtues when they meet all the conditions of\nappropriateness: the recipient is worthy of help, one can afford to\nhelp, it is in one’s rational self-interest (or not contrary to\nit) to help, and so on. Perhaps Rand thinks that they are\n“minor” virtues because we are not obligated to act on\nthem at all times, the way we are obligated to act justly and honestly\nat all times. A deeper reason, however, might be her conception of\npeople as essentially agents rather than patients, doers rather than\nreceivers, self-sufficient rather than dependent. Nevertheless,\nRand’s view of the unity of the virtues dictates that, even if\nwe are not obligated to act on charity, kindness etc. at all\ntimes, they are just as important to possess as the other\nvirtues. Moreover, in keeping with her emphasis on the importance of\ngoodwill towards others and “the benevolent universe\npremise”, Rand’s heroes are often extraordinarily (and\nalmost always appropriately) kind and generous, not only towards those\nthey love but also towards mere acquaintances, and even sometimes\nadversaries.  Striking examples include, from The\nFountainhead, Howard Roark’s unsought-for attempt to give\nhope and courage to Steven Mallory, the gifted young sculptor whose\nfailure to get work has driven him to the verge of a spiritual and\nphysical collapse, and Roark’s unreproachful help to his\nerstwhile adversary, Peter Keating, when Keating falls on hard\ntimes. In Atlas Shrugged, Dagny offers support to a\nheart-broken and despairing Cheryl Taggart who, in the past, has\ntreated Dagny with scorn, and Hank Rearden generously supports his\nexploitative family before he realizes their \nexploitativeness.[8]\nRand’s implicit recognition that kindness and generosity are important\nvirtues is shown also in her depiction of her villains as lacking all\nkindness and generosity. \nJust as rationality, a focus on reality, is at the heart of every\nvirtue, so irrationality, evasion of reality (including\nself-deception), is at the heart of every vice. Rand’s villains\nare all master evaders motivated by a desire for power, social status,\nfame, or unearned wealth, and resentment of the good. They are\n“second-handers”—people whose primary relationship\nis to other people rather than to reality. Between the virtuous and\nthe vicious are the “innocently wrong”, people who adopt\nwrong moral principles or make wrong choices, not through evasion but\nthrough an error of judgment (Rand does not explicitly recognize any\nmoral category other than virtue, vice, and moral error, although her\nnovels portray characters that do not easily fit into any of these\ncategories). Hank Rearden, in Atlas Shrugged, is the great\ninnocent living under a burden of unearned guilt because of his\nmistaken sense of honor and a family interested only in manipulating\nand using him. Cheryl Taggart is killed by the too-sudden revelation\nthat the man she loved and admired as the embodiment of her ideals is\na fraud—and that the world is full of such frauds. \nAs already indicated, Rand justifies virtue in both instrumental and\nnon-instrumental terms, though without distinguishing between them.\nThe instrumental arguments show the existential and psychological\nrewards of virtue and costs of vice. In her depiction of her heroes,\nRand shows her conviction that virtue creates an inner harmony and\nserenity. Virtue also makes one trustworthy, and thus enables mutually\nbeneficial interactions with others.  Evasiveness, by contrast, traps\none in a “tangled web” of rationalizations and\npretenses. The evader who deceives others is either eventually caught,\nor lives in fear of getting caught, becoming dependent on\nothers’ unconsciousness. He is “a fool”, says a\ncharacter in Atlas Shrugged, “whose source of values is\nthe fools he succeeds in fooling” (1957 [1992]: 945). Further,\nlike Sartre, Rand holds that no evasion is completely successful,\nbecause the truth constantly threatens to resurface. Hence, the\nevader’s “diseased soul” is in a state of constant\ninner conflict and anxiety as he tries to suppress his awareness of\nuncomfortable truths while maintaining his hold on others. His lack of\nintegrity and of esteem for reality results in a lack of self-love or\nself-esteem and, indeed, of a solid self. (It is noteworthy, however,\nthat Rand’s portrayal of Gail Wynand in The Fountainhead is\ncloser to Aristotle’s portrayal of the vicious man in Book III\nof the Nicomachean Ethics as someone who is\n“unconscious of his vice” than to her own stated view of\nthe evader.) \nThese views are familiar from the history of philosophy, but many\nreaders find their expression in Rand’s novels to be of unusual\npsychological depth and conviction. Nevertheless, the views are\nsubject to the well-known objection that the complexity and\nvariability of human psychology and society allow only “for the\nmost part” generalizations about the existential and\npsychological benefits of virtue or costs of vice. For example, it is\npossible for a small injustice to lead to great rewards, especially\nsince others are willing to shrug off or forgive occasional\ntransgressions. It is also possible for poor introspection,\nforgetfulness, or self-acceptance to allow one to evade something\nwithout any need for supporting evasions or damage to one’s\nself-esteem. Again, even if every wrongdoing carries psychological\ncosts, these might sometimes be outweighed by the long-term\npsychological and existential costs of doing the right thing (as Rand\nherself suggests in her portrayal of the embittered Henry Cameron and\nStephen Mallory in The Fountainhead). \nThe non-instrumentalist justification of virtue in Rand’s novels\nis largely immune to these objections (though subject to the\nobjections noted in 2.4 above). To\ncompromise morally is, necessarily, to compromise one’s own\n(objectively conceived) happiness, because no existential loss can\ncompare to the loss of moral integrity. Rectitude is partly\nconstitutive of genuine happiness because it expresses the right\nrelationship to reality: to existence, to oneself, and to others. For\nthe same reason, it is partly constitutive of a self worth loving, an\nideally human or rational self. Any value gained at the price of\nrectitude is only the simulacrum of genuine value. In a variety of\nconceptually interconnected ways, then, virtuous individuals are\nnecessarily better off than those willing to take moral short-cuts. In\nits structure and much of its content, Rand’s ethical egoism is\nthus of a piece with the egoism of ancient eudaimonistic\ntheories. \nOf course, this non-instrumentalist justification of virtue depends on\nthe prior instrumentalist justification, viz., that in normal\ncircumstances (that is, in a society of more or less virtuous people),\nvirtue enables us to gain both external and psychological goods. If\njustice or kindness were systematically bad for human beings, leading\nto disease and death, they would not be virtues. If rationality\nroutinely led to an early demise, no one would value rationality. But\nthis does not entail, as Salmieri seems to think, that the ultimate\nvalue is literal survival (Salmieri 2019). All it entails is that the\nvirtues be compatible with survival in normal\ncircumstances. For it is easy to see that if justice or kindness\nsystematically led to deep depression, and rationality routinely\nsucked the joy out of life, only the rare misery-lover would value his\nlife, or the virtues. Survival is a necessary condition of a happy\nlife (as well as an unhappy one), not an ultimate value. And\nit’s only because the virtues lead to, and partly constitute, a\nhappy (eudaimonic) life, that a virtuous person considers it a greater\nloss to betray his principles than to lose the work he loves –\nor, sometimes, even his life. One of the best examples of this from\nRand’s own work is Howard Roark’s decision to act out of\nintegrity, even at the cost of being unable to practice architecture\n(The Fountainhead). Another example concerns two minor\ncharacters in We The Living who risk – and lose –\ntheir freedom and lives for resisting the new communist regime. (Note,\nhowever, that Rand does not think that we are morally obligated to\nmartyr ourselves to fight evil. All we are obligated to do is not be\ncomplicit in evil, or betray our values.) \nEven on this indirect, sophisticated egoism, where the good to the\nagent lies in being virtuous, Rand’s theory is open to the objection\noften levied against egoistic theories, viz., that they give the wrong\nreason for acting in other-regarding ways – justly, kindly, etc. My\nact does not adequately express the virtue of justice if I give you\nyour due solely or primarily because acting justly is good for me\nrather than because I recognize and respect your moral standing, your\nentitlement to be treated justly. Nor does my helping you when you\nneed help adequately express goodwill or kindness if I help you solely\nor primarily because acting benevolently is good for me. One way out\ntaken by some other theories is to argue that the\negoist’s justification is egoistic but not\nher motivation. Rand does not address the\n“wrong-reason” objection, but there is no hint in her\nwritings that she would accept this dichotomy between justification\nand motivation. The root of the problem is that, although Rand rejects\npsychological egoism, she seems to regard genuine goodwill towards, or\nlove of, others as an offshoot of proper self-love, as though there\nwere no independent source of love for others in human nature. This is\nwhere her metaethics and ethics differ most starkly from that of\nAristotle.  \nAccording to Rand, there is only one alternative to being rationally\nself-interested: sacrificing one’s proper interests, either for\nthe sake of other people (which she equates with altruism) or for the\nsake of the supernatural (which she calls mysticism) (1982a:\nch. 7). “The basic principle of altruism”, she argues,\n“is that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that\nservice to others is the only justification of his existence, and that\nself-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value”\n(“Faith and Force,” PWNI 61).  Kant’s ethics is a secularized\nmysticism insofar as it rests on categorical commands and duty for\nduty’s sake, which is to say: regardless of any earthly desire\nor interest (1970). An altruistic ethics equates right action with\nself-sacrifice for the sake of others’ good and immorality with\n“selfishness”, while saying nothing about the standard of\nthe good (“Introduction”, 1964a: iii; 1974). It thus fails\nto answer the prior question of what code of values we should follow\nand why, and provides no motivation to be moral other than guilt over\n“selfishness”. When taken to its logical conclusion,\naltruism does not simply tell us that it is “selfish” to\npursue our own desires, but also that it is “selfish to\nuphold… [our own] convictions, … [that we] must\nsacrifice them to the convictions of others” (Rand 1957 [1992]:\n943; Galt’s Speech, Rand 1961a: 142). In foreign policy,\naltruism is used to justify and gain support for America’s\nintervention in other countries (1966a). Altruism is also the reason\nwhy so many sympathize with, or even praise, bloody dictatorships that\nproudly proclaim that the sacrifice of the individual is a necessary\nand noble means to the goal of the collective good (Rand 1966a). \nAs a moral code, altruism is impractical, because its requirements are\ncontrary to the requirements of life and happiness, both the\nagent’s and other people’s. As such, it is also profoundly\nimmoral. Altruism leaves us without any moral guidance in our everyday\nlives and gives morality a bad name. \nWhat, then, is the psychological explanation for the widespread\nequation of altruism with morality? Rand suggests various explanations\nreminiscent of Nietzsche’s analysis of the psychology of\naltruism. The theorists and preachers of altruism are motivated\nlargely by a desire to control and manipulate others by playing on\ntheir guilt. Those who accept their teachings typically do so either\nbecause of guilt over their own superior achievements, or because,\nlacking any “intellectual integrity, love of truth…or a\npassionate dedication to an idea”, they have nothing much worth\nsaving, and so do not mind sacrificing themselves (“Selfishness\nWithout a Self”, 1973b; 1982a). Some altruists are altruists\nbecause their mentalities are still frozen in a tribal past when\nsurvival required the sacrifice of some for the sake of others\n(1973b). Rand herself rejects a zero-sum picture of human\nrelationships, so long as everyone in the relationship acts\nrationally. \nRand’s defense of “selfishness” (rational\nself-interest) and rejection of altruism (living for others’\nsake) are part of the reason both for her popularity with the general\nreader, and her unpopularity with philosophers and other\nintellectuals, although some would no doubt agree with her rejection\nof abject self-sacrifice and her recognition of proper concern with\nthe self as moral (Falk 1963; Gilligan 1982; Hampton 1993; Badhwar\n1993a). The general reader who responds positively to Rand’s\nwork finds, for the first time, a moral justification for pursuing a\nlife of her or his own and a liberation from “unearned\nguilt”. The philosopher who responds negatively to her work\nfinds many biased and simplistic interpretations of philosophers and\nphilosophical doctrines, including her claim that she is the first to\nconsistently defend a morality of rational self-interest, all other\nphilosophers having defended either altruism or mysticism (Pojman\n1995). Her critics also challenge her equation of altruism with abject\nself-sacrifice (Rachels 2000, Flew 1984), and her claim (explained\nbelow) that there is no conflict between people’s\nrational interests (Flew 1984).   “Force and mind are opposites; morality ends where a gun\nbegins” (Atlas Shrugged 1023). Not only actually shooting\nsomeone, but also threatening him with a gun, is an act of force. The\nnon-initiation of force against others is the basic moral principle\nguiding our interactions with others, whether in a political society,\nor in the state of nature.  It is also the basic political principle:\n“no man may initiate the use of physical force against\nothers. … Men have the right to use physical force only\nin retaliation and only against those who initiate its\nuse” (1961b, 1964a: 36). This political principle binds not only\nindividuals in their interactions with each other, but also,\nimportantly, the government. Rand’s ideal society is a society\nof independent individuals who respect each other’s rights to\nlife, liberty, and property, and who trade value for value, materially\nand spiritually.  They live, in her words, by “the trader\nprinciple”.  Individual rights and the trader principle are both\ndictated by the fact that, as rational, independent beings, we need to\nthink and act for our “proper survival” (1961b: 31). Both\nare based in human nature, and required by respect for individuals as\nends in themselves, not mere means to others’ ends. But what\nexactly is a right?  \n“Rights” are a moral concept—the concept that\nprovides a logical transition from the principles guiding an\nindividual’s actions to the principles guiding his relationship\nwith others—the concept that preserves and protects individual\nmorality in a social context—the link between the moral code of\na man and the legal code of a society, between ethics and politics.\nIndividual rights are the means of subordinating society to moral\nlaw. (1963b: 92).  \nAgain, \nThese rights are based in human nature, and are basically rights to\nactions, not to things or outcomes, and they can be violated only\nthrough the initiation or threat of force, or through fraud. Hence,\nall natural rights are negative, that is, claims on others’\nnon-interference, and not claims on them to provide one with certain\ngoods or outcomes.[9]\nThe fundamental right is the right to life:\nthe right to take the actions necessary for sustaining the life proper\nto a human being. \nThe right to life means…the freedom to take all the actions\nrequired by the nature of a rational being for the support, the\nfurtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (Such\nis the meaning of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of\nhappiness.). (1963b: 93)  \nThe right to liberty is the right to act (including to write and\nspeak) on one’s judgment; the right to the pursuit of happiness\nis the right to pursue goals for one’s own fulfillment; the\nright to property is “the right to gain, to keep, to use and to\ndispose of material values” (1963b: 94). Like the mind-body\ndichotomy, the common dichotomy between “human rights” and\nthe right to property is a false one, because to own one’s life\nis to own one’s actions and their fruits (1962b:\n 91).[10]\n Just as there is a causal and logical connection between the virtues,\nso there is between these rights: a government that violates human\nrights also violates property rights. Thus, for example, in violating\nthe right to freedom of expression by banning “obscene”\nspeech on TV, the government violates the property right of the owners\nof the TV station to use their property as they see fit. Like other\nlibertarians, both right (market) and left (egalitarian), Rand opposes\nstate regulation of morality, as well as forced service to the state,\nwhether military or civilian. She criticizes both conservatives and\nliberals (as these terms are understood in American politics) for\nwanting government to control the realm they regard as important: the\nspiritual or moral realm in the case of conservatives, and the\nmaterial or economic realm in the case of liberals (1981b). Both sides\nthus betray a lack of understanding of the fact that human beings need\nto be free in both realms to be free in either. \nCritics have pointed out that if we have rights only because we need\nthem for our survival and happiness, then we have no right to take\nactions that are contrary to our survival and happiness, such\nas blindly following a guru instead of thinking for ourselves, living\noff others because we prefer the life of a couch potato to fending for\nourselves, wasting our property instead of using it wisely, or, most\nobviously, committing suicide (Mack 1984; Zwolinski 2019). Yet the\nfreedom to do only that which is morally good or rational is no\nfreedom. But there is another interpretation of the claim that\n“The right to life means…the freedom to take all the\nactions required by the nature of a rational being for the support,\nthe furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own\nlife.” What Rand is pointing out here is that we would not have\nrights if we did not need them for our survival and happiness (Badhwar\n2017, Miller & Mossoff 2019). This need (and the fact that we\nvalue our survival and happiness) is the source of rights. If by our\nvery nature we didn’t care whether we lived or died,\ndidn’t care about being forced by the government or other people\nto act in certain ways and not others, had no use for property, and\ncouldn’t be bothered to think for ourselves, we would have no\nrights. It doesn’t follow, however, that we don’t have the\nright to act contrary to the requirements of our survival or\nhappiness. As Rand says elsewhere:  \nA right is the sanction of independent action. A right is that which\ncan be exercised without anyone’s permission (Rand 2018 83).  \n[A] right is the moral sanction of a positive, of his freedom to act\non his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own voluntary,\nuncoerced choice. (Rand 1963b 93.) \nIn spite of several statements that justify such freedom in terms of\nthe individual’s rational judgments (Rand 1965 17), it is\nthe position taken here that is compatible with Rand’s\ndeep-seated commitment to liberty and a minimal government.  \nAnother criticism of Rand’s theory of rights is that it is\nincompatible with her ethical egoism, because respect for\nothers’ rights cannot be justified as a means to the ultimate\nend of one’s survival (Mack 1984; Flew 1984). For under\nperfectly realistic scenarios, one’s survival can require one to\nviolate another’s right to life or property. Thus, according to\nthese critics, Rand’s defense of rights suffers from the same\nunresolved tension between the instrumentalist strand and the deontic\nstrand that we find in her justification of morality in general (Mack\n1984, 2003). On our eudaimonistic interpretation of\nRand’s ethical egoism and theory of rights, there is no\nincompatibility between the two. Nevertheless, as we’ve argued\nabove, both her ethical egoism and her theory of rights face the\ncriticism that the primary reason for respecting others’ rights,\nor exercising any of the other-regarding virtues, is not one’s\neudaimonia but the fact that others are ends in\nthemselves. What promotes our eudaimonia is recognizing this and\nliving accordingly, but our own eudaimonia is not the primary\nreason for respecting people’s rights.  Everything said so far shows that Rand believes that individuals\nhave rights even in a state of nature, or a society without a\ngovernment. Yet in later years, in a workshop on rights, Rand suggests\nthat rights exist only in a society with some kind of authority and a\n“formulated morality” (2018: 111). It is not clear what Rand\nmeans by “formulated morality”: a written, or at least\nexplicitly stated, morality that recognizes rights, like the Bill of\nRights in the U.S. Constitution? Or like Thomas Paine’s Rights of\nMan?? But aren’t there many societies – perhaps a majority\n– that don’t have a formulated morality yet do recognize at\nleast individuals’ basic rights against each other and the government,\nand many that can produce paper Constitutions claiming to recognize\nthese rights that, in fact, they deny their citizens? In any case,\nRand takes back her controversial statement by reiterating her earlier\nview that: \nThe source of man’s rights is not divine law or congressional\nlaw, but the law of identity. A is A and Man is Man. Rights are\nconditions of existence required by man’s nature for his proper\nsurvival (“Galt’s Speech,” Rand 1961a: 182). \n\nWhat we don’t have in the absence of a government, she says, is\nobjectively defined laws that can determine if a right has been\nviolated (2018: 211). A “proper government,” in her words,\n“is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical\nforce under objective control, i.e., under objectively defined\nlaws” (1963a: 128). \nOnkar Ghate (2019) and Harry Binswanger (2019) both defend this\nview. Ghate uses two scenarios involving individuals in a state of\nnature. Suppose you are by yourself on a desert island, and you\ndomesticate a pig. Then someone from a neighboring tribe steals it. Do\nyou have a right to retaliate by stealing some of his property, or\nstealing from his relatives? Again, suppose Robinson Crusoe and Friday\nare strangers sharing an island, and Crusoe invents a superior\nspear. Does Friday have a right to copy it? Ghate’s main point is that\nbecause individuals in his scenarios don’t have a government, they\ndon’t have objectively defined laws, and because they don’t have\nobjectively defined laws, the boundaries of their property rights are\nunclear. But Ghate does not explain why you, the pig owner, cannot\ntalk to the tribe and come up with a mutually agreeable solution, or\nwhy Crusoe and Friday can’t talk things over and decide on the\nboundaries of their rights vis-a-vis each other (if Crusoe has any\ncommon sense, he’ll encourage Friday to copy his spear and propose\nthat they cooperate in their future hunts). Of course the tribe and\nyou might not be able to reach a resolution satisfactory to both of\nyou. But that doesn’t mean that it is in principle impossible to do\nso. Neither Rand nor Ghate (2019) provide an explanation of why a\npeaceful society of people without a government cannot come up with\nobjective laws that define the boundaries of their rights – as,\nin fact, they do in Rand’s Atlantis: Galt’s Gulch. Their\nview seems to imply that if the Founding Fathers had been shipwrecked\nfor 5 years on a desert island, they could not have come up with a\nBill of Rights that defined the limits of their liberties vis-a-vis\neach other, or set up a fair system of adjudication in the event of a\ndispute. But we don’t have to engage in hypotheticals. As many\nscholars have pointed out, starting in the 11th C, merchants from\nvarious countries created the body of law called the Law Merchant in\norder to protect foreign merchants not protected by the local laws\n(Benson 1989; see the entry on law merchant at\nlibertarianism.org, linked from Other Internet Resources). The Law\nMerchant was uniform throughout Europe, and enforced by courts also\ncreated by merchants in European cities, without the involvement of\nany European government. \nRand argues that the only just social-political system, the only\nsystem compatible with our rational nature and with the right of\nindividuals to live for their own sakes, is capitalism (1965, 1967b),\nthat is,  \nlaissez-faire capitalism—with a separation of state and\neconomics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation\nof state and church. (1961b, 1964a)  \nState regulation of the market, she argues, is responsible for\ncorrupting both state and market institutions, just as political\nregulation of religion (or religious regulation of politics), wherever\nit exists, corrupts both state and religious institutions. Regulation\ncreates the opportunity for the trading of favors between politicians\nand religious leaders, and politicians and businesses. Atlas\nShrugged offers a complex and compelling depiction of the\neconomic, political, and moral corruption spawned by\n“cronyism” between government and business.\nLaissez-faire capitalism is “the only [social] system\nthat bans force from social relationships” domestically and\nabroad, because the trader and the warrior are antagonists (Rand\n1966a). Rand’s conception of capitalism is, thus, more radical\nthan the mainstream conception, and her defense of it significantly\ndifferent both from the utilitarian defenses given by most economists,\nand the religious defenses given by many conservatives (for\ndiscussion, see Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1984b; Machan 1984). She does,\nof course, praise capitalism (or semi-capitalism) for creating\nwidespread prosperity, but this feature is itself explained only by\nthe fact that it leaves individuals free to produce in peace. In\nAtlas Shrugged, Rand distinguishes between the few business\npeople who earn their money through honest effort, without seeking\nfavors from the government, and the vast majority who are members of\n“the aristocracy of pull” (“crony\ncapitalists”, in contemporary terminology) and get rich only\nthrough such favors, a situation that she thinks prevails, and has\nalways prevailed, in the real world (Rand 1964c). She holds that for a\nshort period in the nineteenth-century America came closer to a\nlaissez-faire system than any other society before or since,\nbut that capitalism remains an unknown ideal.  Some critics complain,\nhowever, that in her non-fiction (1961c) Rand does not always\nrecognize the aristocrats of pull in the real world—business\nleaders who lobby politicians for subsidies for themselves and\nrestrictions on their competitors (Rothbard 1968; Johnson 2006). \nRand rejects the criticism that unregulated, laissez-faire\ncapitalism would lead to a concentration of power in a few hands and\nundermine people’s ability to lead their own lives,\nbecause laissez-faire capitalism requires the rule of law, a\nwell-defined system of property rights, freedom of contract, and, as a\ncorollary, a government that abstains from all favoritism. In such a\nsociety, competition and opportunity will flourish, and prevent\nconcentration of power in a few hands.  \nRand holds that there is no conflict between one person’s\nrational interests and another’s, hence that there is no\nconflict between their rights (1962a, 1964a: 57–65). Is it true,\nhowever, that rational interests cannot conflict, or that, if they do,\nit follows that rights must also conflict? Our answer to both\nquestions is ‘no’. We think that whenever two or more\npeople have a rational interest in one good, there is potential for\nconflict, and sometimes that potential is actualized. To show\notherwise, Rand considers a situation in which two people apply for\nthe same job, and the better candidate gets the job. There is no\nconflict of interests here, she argues, because the better candidate\nhas earned the job, and the loser cannot rationally wish to have been\ngiven the job. Both applicants also know that competition for jobs is\na good thing, because the business would close if only one person\napplied for its jobs (presumably, because that would mean that the\nbusiness wasn’t doing very well). \nBoth points are well-taken. But what if the employer is not rational\nand gives the job to the somewhat less qualified applicant because,\nsay, he reminds the employer of his long-lost brother? Or, what if the\ntwo candidates are equally qualified, and the hiring committee chooses\none over the other by tossing a coin? In both cases there is a\nconflict of interests between two rational applicants. Rand raises the\nfirst possibility, that of the irrational employer, but doesn’t\ntrace its implications for her thesis that rational interests\ndon’t conflict. The second possibility, that of two equally\nqualified candidates, she does not consider at all. Rand would be on\nfirmer ground if she were to argue that there is no necessary\nconflict between rational interests, that is, that it is not in\ntheir nature to conflict. When they conflict, it is due to\ncontingent factors, such as only one job for two equally qualified\npeople. In any case, a conflict between rational interests does not\nentail a conflict between rights, since, as Rand herself points out,\nneither party has a right to the job. \nRand defines government as:  \nan institution that holds the exclusive power to enforce\ncertain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area. (1963a:\n125)  \nA proper government is:  \nthe means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under\nobjective control—i.e., under objectively defined law.\n(1963b: 128)  \nSuch a government is minimal, limited to protecting us from criminals\nand foreign aggressors, and enforcing individual rights and contracts\nwith the help of the police and armed forces, using objectively\ndefined civil and criminal laws and courts. Someone who violates his\ncontracts, or engages in fraud, is guilty of the\n“indirect” use of force, in that he obtains a value from\nanother without that person’s consent (1963a: 111). Accordingly,\nthe government may use or threaten force only in retaliation against\nthose who initiate or threaten force directly or indirectly. A\ngovernment that tries to enforce the brother’s keeper\nprinciple—“from each according to his ability, to each\naccording to his need”; or that drafts citizens into the armed\nservices or “public service”; or that forces them,\ndirectly or indirectly, to become more virtuous, well-mannered,\nhealthy, or wealthy, violates rights. Statism in all its forms, from\nunlimited democracy to a mixed economy to dictatorship, is at odds\nwith our status as independent, rational beings, as ends in\nourselves. Statism also destroys ability and fails to fulfill\nanyone’s needs for long, because “[t]o deal with men by\nforce is as impractical as to deal with nature by persuasion”\n(1973a: 32). The fountainhead of all progress is the human mind, and\nthe mind does not function well when forced. \nIn Atlas Shrugged Rand depicts her utopia, Galt’s\nGulch, as a “voluntary association of men held together by\nnothing but every man’s self-interest”, without any formal\norganization (1957 [1992]: 690). There is a judge to arbitrate\ndisagreements, but there has never been any need for arbitration.\nGalt’s Gulch is, thus, an anarchist society, although Rand never\ncalls it that. In “The Nature of Government”, however,\nRand rejects anarchism as irrational and unworkable because, she says,\nit is incompatible with a single, objective system of law and, thus,\nwith rights and peaceful cooperation (1963a; cf. 2018b). Anarchist\ncritics, such as Roy Childs (1969 [1994]) and Murray Rothbard (1978),\nhave argued that a territorial monopoly on law and force (government)\nis not necessary, because people can establish a just and effective\nlegal system in a competitive market of security providers (see Long\nand Machan 2009). The Law Merchant, a body of law established and\nenforced in private courts by the merchants of various countries,\nillustrates the possibility of an effective voluntary legal\nsystem. Further, a government is incompatible with Rand’s own\nprinciple of the non-initiation of force, a principle she regards as\nthe linchpin of a moral society (Long 2013; cf. Cox 2013a and\n2013b). \nThe trader principle states that a voluntary, mutually beneficial\nexchange between independent equals is the only basis for a mutually\nrespectful and rational relationship (1961b: 31). It is also the only\nbasis for a peaceful relationship among countries: “the trader\nand the warrior have been fundamental antagonists throughout\nhistory” (1966a: 38). \nThe trader principle applies to emotional relationships as well. To\nlove or admire someone is to “pay” him for the pleasure\none derives from his virtues (1961b: 31)—or, Rand might say in\nthe case of love for a small child, from his personality. It would\nseem, however, that the trade between parent and child is unequal,\ngiven that the child receives both pleasure and material support from\nthe parent. And it is unclear how the trader principle applies at all\nwhen a severe disability renders a beloved child or spouse a source of\npain rather than pleasure. \nIf feminism is the view that women are, and ought to be recognized as,\nmen’s intellectual, moral, sexual, and political equals, then\nthe Objectivist philosophy of human nature is inherently feminist,\nsince it applies equally to all human beings, regardless of gender (or\nrace) (N. Branden 1999). Decades before it was considered acceptable\nfor women to lack “maternal instincts” or pursue careers,\nRand created heroines who lack the first and pursue the second, free\nof guilt or\n self-doubt.[11]\n Kira (We the Living) wants to be an engineer, and Dagny\n(Atlas Shrugged) runs Taggart Transcontinental, the largest\nand most successful transcontinental railroad in the country. None of\nRand’s heroines sacrifices her interests, intellect, or\nprinciples for the man or men in her life. One literary critic argues\nthat Dagny is the first, and perhaps only, epic heroine in Western\nliterature because of the grandness of her vision, her courage and\nintegrity, her unusual abilities, and her national importance\n(Michalson 1999). Rand’s depiction of her heroines’\nenjoyment of sex and their freedom from all merely conventional norms\nabout sex anticipates the sexual liberation movement of the\n20th century by at least 30 years. In all three novels, it\nis the heroine who has the power to choose which of the men who love,\nadmire, and desire her (and only her) she will have. Rand was also an\nardent champion of a woman’s right to control her own\nreproductive choices (1968a, 1981). \nHer relationship to the feminist movement, however, was more complex.\nAlthough she praised Betty Friedan’s The Feminine\nMystique, mainstream feminism’s collectivism and emphasis\non women as victims later led her to reject feminism as such. Many\ntheorists argue that Rand’s work, especially Atlas\nShrugged, upholds important feminist ideals, even as it succumbs\nto some anti-feminist tendencies that contradict her individualistic\nethics (e.g., Gladstein 1978, 1999; B. Branden 1999; Presley 1999;\nSheaffer 1999; Taylor 1999). Many others regard her and her work as\nplainly anti-feminist, with Susan Brownmiller even calling her\n“a traitor to her own sex” (Brownmiller 1975). One\ncriticism takes aim at the individualism of Rand’s ethics and\npolitics, which rejects any special government help for women or\ndiscrimination against men (e.g., Harrison 1978). Another objects that\nRand has internalized a masculine conception of human nature and\nvirtue, and then created her ideal woman in light of this conception\n(Brownmiller 1975; Glennon 1979). This may be responsible for\nRand’s puzzling (and offensive) view that the essence of\nfemininity is to hero-worship (not men, but) masculinity, while\ninsisting (as her novels depict) that women and men are inherently\nequal and that the ideal romantic relationship is between moral and\nintellectual equals (1968b; cf. Brown 1999). At least as offensive to\nmany are the violent sex scenes in her novels, especially the infamous\nscene in The Fountainhead that many regard as rape, where\nHoward Roark has sex with Dominique in spite of her resistance. \nThose who reject the charge of rape argue that in the 1940s and 50s,\nwhen Rand wrote her novels, it would have been seen as rough sex\nrather than non-consensual sex (McElroy 1999; Sheaffer 1999). That\nRand herself thought of this scene as consensual is shown a few pages\nlater, when she writes: “They had been united in an\nunderstanding beyond the violence, beyond the deliberate obscenity of\nhis action” (1943: 218). And in letters to disturbed readers in\n1946 and 1965, Rand denied that the scene is “actual rape”\nwhich, she stated, is “a dreadful crime”, a “vicious\naction and a violation of a woman’s rights” (Rand 1995a).\nOn the other hand, she also depicts Dominique exultantly telling\nherself that she’s been raped. McElroy wonders if having her\nheroine call it rape is just another instance of Rand’s desire\nto provoke and shock the reader (McElroy 1999), as when she uses\n“selfishness” to mean “rational\nself-interest”. \nRand holds that our actions need guidance by a vision of the\nfundamental nature of the universe and of the efficacy of human\nthought and activity—a vision that can be grasped directly\nrather than requiring the conscious repetition of long chains of\nabstract reasoning. The chief function of art is to meet this\npsychological need by expressing abstract conceptual values and\nmetaphysical truths in concrete perceptible form. Art, according to\nRand, constitutes a selective, stylized re-creation of reality, with\nthe principle of selection being the artist’s “sense of\nlife”, a set of implicit “metaphysical\nvalue-judgments”, i.e., judgments about what is fundamentally\nsignificant about the world and our place in it. (There is controversy\namong Rand scholars as to whether what is re-created in art is certain\nelements of reality or reality as a whole, i.e., a\n“microcosm”, as well as how and whether the concept of\nre-creation applies to apparently non-representational forms of art:\nTorres and Kamhi 2000; Bissell 2004.) Both the artist’s creative\nwork and the audience’s emotional responses to it are driven by\ntheir senses of life, that is, the worldviews they have “formed\nby a process of emotional generalization … a subconscious\ncounterpart of a process of abstraction” (1966b: 27). The role\nof art in sustaining us psychologically by providing a concretization\nof our most fundamental values is a frequent theme in Rand’s\nfiction as well, especially The\n Fountainhead.[12] \nWhile art can be used to convey information or to advocate a position,\nsuch functions are secondary to its chief task: providing an object\nwhose mere contemplation brings spiritual fulfillment. Hence Rand does\nnot regard her own novels primarily as vehicles for her philosophy,\nthough of course they are that inter alia. Given her own\nworldview, Rand favors literature with a strong plot as a way of\nexpressing purposeful human action in a world of causal regularity,\nand stories involving value-conflicts as a way of expressing the\nimportance of free choice; hence her preference for romantic (as\nopposed to, e.g., naturalistic) literature. But Rand holds that it is\npossible to evaluate an artwork’s aesthetic value simply in\nterms of its success in conveying a concretization of the\nartist’s sense of life, whether or not one shares the values and\njudgments so conveyed.","contact.mail":"nbad@ou.edu","contact.domain":"ou.edu"},{"date.published":"2010-06-08","date.changed":"2020-07-13","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ayn-rand/","author1":"Neera K.

Early in her career she also wrote\nshort stories, plays, and screenplays. Rand’s first and most\nautobiographical novel, We the Living (1936), set in the\nSoviet Union, was published only after many rejections, owing to\nwidespread sympathy for the Soviet “experiment” among the\nintellectuals of the day. We the Living was quickly followed\nby the dystopian novel, Anthem (1938), written as “a\nkind of rest” from work on her next major novel, The\nFountainhead (1943). The Fountainhead, also published\nafter many rejections because of its individualism, and largely panned\nby critics, soon became a best-seller by word of mouth. The\nFountainhead brought Rand international fame, and Atlas\nShrugged (1957) sealed this fame. By 1958, Rand’s novels,\nincreasingly philosophical, had won her ideas a sufficiently devoted\nfollowing for her to form, in association with psychologist Nathaniel\nBranden (with whom she later broke), an official\n“Objectivist” philosophical movement, complete with\njournals and lecture courses. For all her popularity, however, only a\nfew professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a\nresult, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in\nnon-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the\nbibliography reflects this fact. We discuss the main reasons for her\nrejection by most professional philosophers in the first section. Our\ndiscussion of Rand’s philosophical views, especially her\nmoral-political views, draws from both her non-fiction and her\nfiction, since her views cannot be accurately interpreted or evaluated\nwithout doing so.\n\nIn Rand’s own words, her first and greatest love, her\n“life purpose”, was “the creation of the kind of\nworld … that represents human perfection”, while her\ninterest in philosophical knowledge was “only” for the\nsake of this purpose (Journal entry for 4 May 1946; in 1997:\n 479).[1]\n Nevertheless, her interest in philosophical knowledge continued long\nafter she had created this world in her magnum opus, Atlas\nShrugged, her last work of fiction. In her non-fiction, Rand\ndeveloped a conception of metaphysical realism, rationality, ethical\negoism (rational self-interest), individual rights,\nlaissez-faire capitalism, and art, and applied her philosophy\nto social issues. She wrote polemical, philosophical essays, often in\nresponse to questions by fans of Atlas Shrugged and The\nFountainhead; lectured on college campuses; and gave radio and\ntelevision interviews. In her own words, her philosophy,  \nin essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own\nhappiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive\nachievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\n(Rand 1957 [1992]: Afterword)  \nCapitalism, “the unknown ideal”, is for her the only\npolitical-economic system compatible with this philosophy because it\nis the only system based on respect for human beings as ends in\nthemselves. The free-market libertarian political movement, though\nlargely disowned by Rand, drew—and draws—great inspiration\nfrom her moral defense of the minimal state, that is, the state whose\nonly raison d’être is protection of individual\nrights. \nWhereas Rand’s ideas and mode of presentation make Rand popular\nwith many non-academics, they lead to the opposite outcome with\nacademics. She developed some of her views in response to questions\nfrom her readers, but seldom took the time to defend them against\npossible objections or to reconcile them with the views expressed in\nher novels. Her philosophical essays lack the self-critical, detailed\nstyle of analytic philosophy, or any serious attempt to consider\npossible objections to her views. Her polemical style, often\ncontemptuous tone, and the dogmatism and cult-like behavior of many of\nher fans also suggest that her work is not worth taking\n seriously.[2]\n Further, understanding her views requires reading her fiction, but\nher fiction is not to everyone’s taste. It does not help that\nshe often dismisses other philosophers’ views on the basis of\ncursory readings and conversations with a few philosophers and with\nher young philosophy student acolytes. Some contemporary philosophers\nreturn the compliment by dismissing her work contemptuously on the\nbasis of hearsay. Some who do read her work point out that her\narguments too often do not support her conclusions. This estimate is\nshared even by many who find her conclusions and her criticisms of\ncontemporary culture, morality, and politics original and insightful.\nIt is not surprising, then, that she is either mentioned in passing,\nor not mentioned at all, in the entries that discuss current\nphilosophical thought about\n virtue ethics,\n egoism,\n rights,\n libertarianism, or\n markets.\n (Readers may also find the entry on\n Nozick’s political philosophy\n to be of interest.) We present specific criticisms of her arguments\nand claims below, in the relevant sections of this entry. \nAyn Rand was born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, to a bourgeois Jewish\nfamily in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 2 February 1905. A witness to the\nRussian Revolution and civil war, Rand opposed both the Communists and\nthe Tsarists. She majored in history, but the social science program\nin which she was enrolled at Petrograd State University included\nphilosophy, law, and philology. Her teachers emphasized—as she\nherself later did—the importance of developing systematic\nconnections among different areas of thought (Sciabarra 2013).\nRand’s formal philosophical education included ancient\nphilosophy (especially Plato and Aristotle), logic, philosophical\npsychology, Marxism-Leninism, and non-Marxist political thought. But\nshe was evidently also exposed to Hegelian and Nietzschean ideas,\nwhich blossomed during this period (known as the Russian Silver Age),\nand read a great deal of Friedrich Nietzsche on her own. After\ngraduating from Petrograd State University in 1924, an interest in\nscreenwriting led her to enroll in the State Institute for\nCinematography. On the literary side, she studied the great Russian\nnovelists and poets, but fell in love with Victor Hugo, to whose\ninfluence she owes the “Romantic Realism” of her\nnovels. \nIn 1925 Rand succeeded in obtaining permission to visit relatives in\nthe United States; hating the Soviet system, she left with no\nintention of returning. After six months with relatives in Chicago,\nshe made her way to Hollywood where, on her second day, a fortuitous\nencounter with Cecil B. DeMille led to a job as a script reader, and\nlater as a screenplay writer. The next week she had another fortuitous\nencounter, this time with the actor Frank O’Connor, whom she\nmarried in 1929. She was married to him till his death in 1979. She\nadopted the pen name Ayn Rand to (it is thought) protect her family\nback in Russia, although she also told the New York Evening\nPost in 1936 that “Rand” was an abbreviation of her\nRussian surname. \nRand and her husband moved permanently to New York City in 1951, where\nshe became involved with, and was influenced by, the circle of mostly\nNew-York-based intellectuals involved in the revival of classical\nliberalism, such as the economic journalist Henry Hazlitt, the\nAustrian economist Ludwig von Mises, and the Canadian-American\nnovelist, literary critic, and political philosopher Isabel Paterson.\nRand also studied, and was a great admirer of, the Lockean philosophy\nof the American founding. Rand lived and worked in New York City until\nher death in 1982. \nRand holds that philosophy, like all forms of knowledge and\nachievement, is important only because it is necessary for living a\ngood human life and creating a world conducive to living such a life.\nPhilosophy supplies the most fundamental cognitive and normative\nabstractions which, respectively, identify and evaluate what is.\nEveryone, according to Rand, needs a philosophy and is guided by at\nleast an implicit one (1982a: ch. 1). Her novels express her belief\nthat if our philosophy is more or less correct, our lives will be more\nor less successful, if our philosophy is wildly off the mark, our\nlives will be disastrous. Philosophy thus has an urgent, practical\nimportance. But unlike Marx, her philosophical and political antipode,\nRand thinks that social change has to start with a moral revolution\nwithin each individual and the spread of the right ideas and ideals\nthrough rational discourse and the inspiration of art. \nRand’s ideal human being appears, in varying degrees of\ndevelopment, in all her novels; her ideal world appears in Atlas\nShrugged. Her novels feature striking, complex plots with subtle\npsychological explorations of her characters’ emotions and\nthoughts, and philosophical reflections that rarely lose sight of the\ndramatic context. Like many famous Russian novelists, especially\nDostoevsky, whom she recognized as a great psychologist, Rand also\nuses long speeches to lay out her philosophy, a device that has both\nits supporters and its detractors. She described Atlas\nShrugged as a “stunt novel” and a murder\nmystery—the murder of the human soul by a collectivist culture.\nBy “soul”, however, she meant not an immortal substance\nthat survives the death of the body—she is not a dualist in any\naspect of her philosophy—but the mind, or the human spirit that\ncelebrates life on this earth. She took a familiar phenomenon and\nliterary trope—a workers’ strike—and turned it on\nits head to show what happens when “the men of\nmind”—scientists, philosophers, industrialists,\nentrepreneurs, writers—the “prime movers” of a\nsociety—go on strike. It also purports to show how the wrong\nmetaphysics can lead to the wrong ethics and thus to disastrous\npersonal choices and a disastrous political and economic system, and\nhow the right philosophy is needed for the rebirth of the soul and the\nrebuilding of the world. Her protagonists are not knights on white\nsteeds rescuing damsels in distress, or swordsmen who can fight off a\ndozen enemies single-handed, but men and women in the\nmid-20th century industrial America of steel mills,\nskyscrapers, and glimmering highways: women who run transcontinental\nrailroads and men who revolutionize architecture or (long before clean\nenergy became a cause célèbre) build a motor\npowered by static electricity to produce limitless, clean energy. Her\nnovels show the importance of striving to be the best we can be: \nDo not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the\nhopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the\nnot-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely\nfrustration for the life you deserved, but never have been able to\nreach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you\ndesired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible….\n(Atlas Shrugged, 1957 [1992]: 983). \nHer novels inspire readers because they present heroes of unbreached\nintegrity, heroes who lead colorful and remarkable lives and succeed\nnot in spite of, but because of, their uncompromising virtue. This\nestimate of their virtue is not, of course, shared by all: many\nreaders find her characters wooden, her writing stilted, and her\nethical and political views misguided. \nRand paid tribute to Aristotle, whom she considered the greatest of\nall philosophers, in the titles she gave to the three Parts of\nAtlas Shrugged (Non-Contradiction, Either-Or, A is\nA) and to one of the chapters (The Immovable Movers). While\nshe differed sharply from Nietzsche on many issues, including\nrationality, free will, and individual rights, his influence is\nevident in her provocative, often aphoristic, point-counterpoint\nwriting style, as well as in her “transvaluation” of\ntraditional values and her powerful affirmation of life and joy and\nthe spirit of youth. In the Introduction to the 25th\nAnniversary edition of The Fountainhead, she stated that the\nnovel’s sense of life is best conveyed by a quotation from\nNietzsche’s Beyond Good and Evil: “The noble soul\nhas reverence for itself”. (For The\nFountainhead’s partly sympathetic and partly critical\nengagement with Nietzsche’s ideas, see Hunt 2006.) \nFundamental to Rand’s outlook—so fundamental that she\nderives the name of her philosophical system,\n“Objectivism”, from it—is a trichotomy among three\ncategories: the intrinsic, the subjective, and the\nobjective (ITOE: 52–54; Rand 1965: 13–23). An\nintrinsic phenomenon is one whose nature depends wholly on factors\nexternal to the mind; a subjective phenomenon is one whose nature\ndepends wholly on the mind; and an objective phenomenon is defined,\nvariously, as that which depends on the relation between a living\nentity’s nature (including the nature of its mind) and its\nenvironment, or as that which depends on the relation between a\nproperly functioning (rational) mind and extramental reality.\nCommentators are divided over the best way to interpret Rand’s\nviews on this issue. \nRand holds that there is a widespread tendency to ignore the third\ncategory or to assimilate it to the second, thus setting up a false\ndichotomy between the intrinsic and the subjective. On Rand’s\nview, many of the fundamental questions of philosophy, from the\nexistence of universals to the nature of value, involve fruitless\ndebates over the false alternative “intrinsic or\nsubjective?” in cases where the phenomenon in question is\nneither intrinsic nor subjective, but rather objective. \nIf ethics is the branch of philosophy concerned with practice, then in\na sense all of Rand’s philosophy is ethics, for Rand stresses\n“the supremacy of actual living over all other\nconsiderations”, and insists that philosophy needs to be\n“brought up to the realm of actual\nliving”—adding “I say intentionally brought\nup to it, not down” (Journal entry for 15 May 1934, p.\n72; in Rand 1997: 73). Consequently, Rand regularly concerns herself\nwith the practical implications and social relevance not only of moral\nand political philosophy, but likewise of the seemingly more arcane\nstrata of metaphysics and epistemology—as when she identifies\nerrors in concept-formation as one of the roots of racism, or\nmind-body dualism as a root of the dichotomy between economic and\npersonal freedom. This approach likewise reflects Rand’s\nemphasis on integrating each piece of information into the total\ncontext of one’s knowledge, and her consequent hostility to\ncompartmentalization. \nRand’s conviction of the vital practical importance of abstract\ntheory may help to explain the passionately polemical nature of her\nphilosophical writing (which some readers find inspiring and others\nhyperbolic and off-putting), although Nietzsche’s influence, as well\nas the influence of her Marxist-Leninist education also probably play\na role. Rand also tended—perhaps owing in part to the same two\ninfluences—to regard philosophical errors as revelatory of the\npsychological flaws of their authors. \nFor a more in-depth presentation of Rand’s views on epistemology\nand metaphysics, please see the\n supplement on Epistemology and Metaphysics\n  \nEthics  \nis a code of values to guide man’s choices and actions—the\nchoices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his\nlife. (1961b: 13)  \nBefore we can decide which code of values we should accept, we need to\nask why we need a code of values at all. Rand claims that no\nphilosopher before her has provided a scientific answer to\nthis question, and so none has provided a satisfactory ethics. \nRand starts by describing value or “the good”, in\nclassical fashion, as the object of pursuit: “that which one\nacts to gain and/or keep” (1961b: 16). Thus, the concept of\nvalue presupposes the concept of “an entity capable of acting to\nachieve a goal in the face of an alternative”—and the\nbasic alternative facing any living entity is life or death (1961b:\n16). It is the conditional nature of life that gives rise to values,\nnot just human values, but values as such. As she puts it:  \nMetaphysically, life is the only phenomenon that is an end in\nitself: a value gained and kept by a constant process of action.\n(1961b: 18)  \nSurvival is the organism’s ultimate value, the “final goal\nor end to which all [its] lesser goals are the means”, and the\nstandard of all its other values: “that which furthers its life\nis the good, that which threatens it is the evil” (pp.\n16–17). The same, suitably modified, applies to human beings.\nLife is the standard and goal of all genuine human values, in the\nsense that all of them—from food to philosophy to fine art to\nethics—must be explained and justified as requirements of human\nsurvival. “Ethics is an objective, metaphysical necessity of\nman’s survival” (p. 24). Thus,  \n[t]he standard of value of the Objectivist ethics … is\nman’s life, or: that which is required for man’s\nsurvival qua man, (1961b: 25)  \nthat is,  \nthe terms, methods, conditions and goals required for the survival of\na rational being through the whole of his lifespan—in all those\naspects of existence which are open to his choice. (1961b: 27)  \nTo choose to live is to accept one’s “own\nlife” as one’s “ethical\npurpose”. \nRand’s metaphysical arguments make three points central to her\naxiology and ethics. (1) All living entities have values, not only\nhuman beings, and only living entities have values: life necessitates\nvalue, and value depends on life. (2) An entity’s values are\ndetermined by its objective life-needs, that is, by the requirements\nof survival for entities of its kind, and ethics is a requirement of\nhuman survival. (3) Thus, values are neither intrinsic properties of\nthings, nor subjective, neither free-floating Platonic entities, nor\nmere matters of preference, time, or culture. Rather, values are\nrelational or objective, dependent on the nature of the valuing entity\nand the nature of its environment.  \nRand supports the first point by arguing that the concept of value\nentails the concept of life:  \nepistemologically, the concept of “value” is genetically\ndependent upon and derived from the antecedent concept of\n“life”. (1961b: 18)  \nShe asks the reader to  \nimagine an immortal, indestructible robot, an entity which moves\nand acts, but which cannot be affected by anything, which cannot be\nchanged in any respect, which cannot be damaged, injured or destroyed.\n(1961b: 16)  \nSuch an entity, she concludes, cannot have values. \nThe problem with this argument is that all it shows is that an entity\nthat cannot be destroyed or harmed cannot have values, and not that a\nnon-living entity cannot have values. Unlike the robot of this\nexample, real robots can be damaged or destroyed, by external\nas well as internal events. What it means for them to be damaged or\ndestroyed is that they cannot perform their functions well, or at\nall. Hence they can, quite straightforwardly, be said to have\n values.[3]\nTo take this into account, Rand would have to say that for an entity\nthat has a function, values are determined by what it needs to\nfunction (well), and that the function of living beings is to survive\n(well). Hence she can still maintain that for living things, values\nare determined by its objective life-needs, hence that values are\nobjective, and that ethics is a requirement of a proper human\nsurvival.  \nRand’s naturalism, and her rejection of intrinsicism and\nsubjectivism in favor of objectivism, anticipate recent naturalisms\nand echo Aristotle’s argument, against both the Platonist and\nthe subjectivist, that “the good” must always be\ngood-for-something. Her conception of the function of\nmorality is notable both for its affinity to, and its difference from,\nThomas Hobbes’ conception: like Hobbes, Rand sees morality as a\nnecessary means to long-term survival, but unlike Hobbes, she does not\nsee morality as requiring a contract or even as a fundamentally social\naffair. The need for morality, according to Rand, is dictated by our\nnature as creatures that must think and produce to survive; hence we\nwould need morality even on a desert island. There is, however, no\nduty to survive; morality is based on a hypothetical imperative: if\nyou choose to live, then you must value your own long-term survival as\nan ultimate end, and morality as a necessary means to it. If asked why the\nchoice to live commits you to your own long-term survival rather than\nsome other ultimate end (such as, for example, the greatest happiness\nof the greatest number (Nozick 1971), or becoming worthy of eternal\nlife in heaven), the only answer is: because any other ultimate end, if\nconsistently adhered to, would lead to death. \nRand’s ethics is thus firmly teleological, this-worldly, and\nfoundationalist. Virtue is “the act by which one gains/and or\nkeeps” values in light of a recognition of certain facts (1961b:\n27, 28); it “is not an end in itself … not its own\nreward” (1957 [1992]: 939). A fact central to a\n“scientific” ethics is that reason is the chief\nindispensable human tool of survival, and we exercise reason by\nchoice. Hence rationality is the fundamental moral virtue, a virtue\nimplicated in all the other virtues, including productiveness\n (Section 2.4 below).  Rand is widely credited by Objectivists (Peikoff 1991; Binswanger\n1990, 1992; Kelley & Thomas 1999—see Other Internet\nResources; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006) with having solved the\nis-ought problem by showing that morality is essential for long-term\nsurvival as a rational being, and so anyone who chooses to live ought\nto be moral (1961b: 19). But if the choice to live is itself a moral\nchoice, in the sense that we ought to choose to live, then the\nargument proceeds from an ought to an ought, not from an is to an\nought. On the other hand, if the choice to live is a non-moral choice\n(an idea that’s hard to reconcile with Rand’s general view\nthat all significant choices are moral choices), then suicide can\nnever be wrong, even if it is done for cowardly, irresponsible, or\nunjust reasons, a view that is obviously incoherent (King 1984 and\nNarveson 1998 criticize this and other aspects of Rand’s moral\nviews).  Again, if morality is needed only for long-term survival, and\nchoosing death is not immoral, then a suicide-bomber does no wrong in\nkilling innocent people. But people don’t lose their rights just\nbecause their killer has decided to kill himself. Darryl Wright seeks\nto save something of the commonsense view that the suicide-bomber acts\nwrongly by arguing that his choice to die without good reason\n“corresponds to a real defect or corruption” in him\n(Wright 2011: 26–29). But this verdict contradicts the premise\nthat choosing death is not immoral. For if the choice expresses a\ncorruption in the character of the suicide-bomber, then the choice\nitself is immoral. Moreover, this response leaves untouched the most\nimportant criticism of the suicide-bomber’s actions: that he\nviolates other people’s rights by using them as mere means to\nhis own (wicked) ends.  More fundamentally, the very idea of morality resting on the\nchoice to live is questionable (Long 2000, Badhwar 2001). Most of us\nrarely, if ever, make a choice to live: we live by default. By giving\nus desires for food and water, for pleasure and security, Nature gives\nus, as she gives other animals, the implicit desire to stay\nalive. Perhaps the most dramatic evidence is the existence of feral\nchildren, children who have managed to stay alive for years in the\ncompany of wild animals. When we grow up, the only time we seriously\nask ourselves if we want to live or die is when living requires an\neffort on our part, such as in a grave illness, or deep depression, or\nemergency. But we start learning the difference between right and\nwrong (for example, don’t hit others, don’t grab their\nthings, and so on) long before we ever consider whether to live or\ndie. A deeper reflection on morality begins when we mature and start\nasking ourselves what constitutes happiness and a worthwhile life. But\nthis is an inherently moral question to which the answers are\ninherently moral or immoral.   Let let us now return to the question of how we should understand\nthe relationship between long-term survival and survival as a rational\nbeing—the life “proper to a rational being” (Rand\n1961b: 27). Is a life proper to a rational being a necessary means,\nand only a necessary means, to literal, long-term survival? Or is such\na life itself the ultimate goal, the kind of survival worth having?\nAgain, what are we to make of the many passages in which Rand states\nthat the ultimate goal is one’s own happiness? \nSome of Rand’s statements suggest that she had only one,\nconsistent ethical view: the ultimate goal is the individual’s\nown survival; the only way to survive long-term, i.e., over a complete\nlife-span, is to live by the standard of man’s life as a\nrational being, which means: to live morally; and happiness is the\npsychological “result, reward and concomitant” (p. 32) of\nliving thus.  Many of Rand’s commentators follow her in holding\nthat there is only one consistent view, while disagreeing on the right\ninterpretation of it (Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000;\nPeikoff 1991; Bidinotto 1994—see Other Internet Resources; Hunt\n1999; Kelley & Thomas 1999—see Other Internet Resources;\nGotthelf 1999; Smith 2000, 2006). Others (Mack 1984, 2003; Badhwar\n1999, 2001; Long 2000) argue that Rand’s writings actually allow\nof two, if not three, mutually incompatible views of the ultimate\ngoal, and our task is to see which of these is the dominant or most\nplausible view. The three views are: survival, survival qua\nrational being, and happiness in the ancient Aristotelian sense of\nflourishing or eudaimonia. In the rest of Section 2, we will\npresent the textual evidence for each of these views of the final\ngoal, and the common objections to them, in turn. \nAll three views are, of course, egoist, in that the primary or sole\nintended beneficiary of morality is supposed to be the moral agent\nherself. But some of the criticisms usually levied at egoism lose some\nof their force when directed at the second and third views. \nThe survivalist view holds that just as literal survival is the\nultimate value for other living entities, so it is for human beings\n(Kelley & Thomas 1999; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000). Survival is the\nsource and final goal of all the actions of an entity, that which\ngives point to all its other values. For human beings, morality and\nhappiness are both instrumental means to survival. The vicious can\n“achieve their goals [only] for the range of a moment”, as\nevidenced by “any criminal or any dictatorship” (1961b:\n26). \n“Non-survivalists” make the following objections:  Like Hobbes, Rand rightly points out that if everyone or most\npeople were to start preying on each other, then no one would survive\nfor long—literally, and that generations of predators\nwould end up destroying or driving away the producers, and thus\ndestroying themselves (Anthem and Atlas\nShrugged). But this doesn’t show that a few predators in a\nsociety of producers cannot survive by predation. Indeed, Rand herself\nsometimes acknowledges that evil people can survive by free-riding\n(“hitch-hiking”, as she calls it) on rational, productive\npeople: \n  If some men attempt to survive by means of brute force or fraud\n  … it still remains true that their survival is made possible\n  only by their victims, only by the men who choose to think and to\n  produce the goods which they, the looters, are seizing. (1961b:\n  25) In “Man’s Rights”, Rand explains an\nindividual’s right to his own life as  \n  the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a\n  rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and\n  the enjoyment of his own life. (1963b: 93 and 1967a: 321–22)\n   \n“Life” here is explicated in terms of not only continued\nsurvival but also of fulfillment and enjoyment.  \nFor all these reasons, a more plausible interpretation of Rand’s\nview is that morality is required for surviving qua human being, that\nis, for living a life proper to a human being. \nJust as the standard of value is survival qua human\nbeing, so the ultimate goal is one’s own survival\nqua human being. To accept this standard and goal is to\naccept (i) the three cardinal values of reason, purpose (or\npurposiveness) and self-esteem as not only “the means to”\nbut also “the realization of one’s ultimate value,\none’s own life” (1961b: 27), and (ii) the three\n“corresponding virtues” of rationality, productiveness,\nand pride. These values are means to one’s life insofar as they\nfurther one’s life as a rational being, and they realize it\ninsofar as they express the value we place on our lives. \nWhat it means to value survival qua human being turns on the\nrelationship of the three cardinal values to the three virtues. Rand\noften states that virtue is only a means to value. But when she\nexplains how the three cardinal values “correspond” to\ntheir three virtues, she does not provide a means-end analysis\n(Badhwar 1999, 2001). Thus, she says: \nProductive work is the central purpose of a rational\nman’s life, the central value that integrates and determines the\nhierarchy of all his other values. Reason is the source, the\nprecondition of his productive work—pride is the result. (1961b:\n27) \nThe virtue of productiveness becomes the central example of purpose\n(one of the three cardinal values), reason (another cardinal value)\nbecomes its source, and the virtue of pride becomes its result. Rand\nalso defines rationality, which is “the basic virtue”, in\nterms of  \nthe recognition and acceptance of reason as one’s only source of\nknowledge … and one’s only guide to action. (1961b: 28)\n \nBy this definition, being rational means valuing reason in thought,\nword, and deed, and realizing reason in one’s life means being\nrational: the virtue and the value entail each other. \nThis point generalizes to all the virtues and values. Further, since\nthe (cardinal) values are both “the means to” and\n“the realization of one’s ultimate value” (1961b:\n27), it follows that the (cardinal) virtues are also both the means to\nand the realization of one’s ultimate value: long-term survival\nqua human being. On this interpretation, to survive\nqua human being is none other than to lead a virtuous life in\nwhich one has realized one’s potential. \nBoth survivalists and eudaimonists, however, point out that\nthis conception of the final end contradicts Rand’s oft-repeated\nclaim that “Virtue is not an end in itself.…” In\naddition, eudaimonists make the following objections: \nIn addition, it is psychologically implausible to hold that we would\nchoose mere survival as an end even if we were deeply unhappy and saw\nno happiness in our future (cf. Wright 2019 20). \nEudaimonists hold that the dominant and/or more plausible\nview expressed in Rand’s writings is that happiness—a\nhappy life—is the ultimate value, where a happy life is\nunderstood as a life of emotional fulfillment in worthwhile goals and\nactivities. Happiness in this sense necessarily involves\nvirtue, but is not identical with virtue (Den Uyl &\nRasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000; Mack 1984; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Hunt\n1999; Long\n 2000).[4] \nHappiness is the existentially and psychologically “successful\nstate of life” (1961b: 27). As an emotion it is not simply a\npositive subjective state, as on some contemporary views, but an\nemotion that meets certain normative standards: “a state of\nnon-contradictory joy—a joy without penalty or guilt”,\nachievable only by  \nthe man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but\nrational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions.\n(1961b: 32)  \nHappiness is also a form of life-affirmation:  \nthe feeling of one’s blessing upon the whole of the earth, the\nfeeling of being in love with the fact that one exists and in this\nkind of world. (1957 [1992]: 105–6)  \nThus, happiness is an emotionally positive state of mind in an\nobjectively worthwhile state of life. \nRand holds that the pursuit of happiness is inseparable from the\nactivity of maintaining one’s life through the rational pursuit\nof rational goals (1961b: 29, 32). A virtuous life is, thus, essential\nto happiness. It is also a shield against soul-wracking unhappiness.\nJust as even great misfortunes don’t throw Aristotle’s\nvirtuous individual into misery, they don’t throw Rand’s\nheroes into misery. Even at the worst of times, the virtuous\nindividual’s pain “only goes down to a certain\npoint” (1943: 344), never touching the core of her being: the\nconviction that she is worthy and\ncapable of\n happiness.[5] \nIn keeping with their richer conception of the final end, Rand’s\nnovels also employ a richer conception of virtue as an integrated\nintellectual-emotional character trait to think, feel, and act in\ncertain ways, rather than simply as an act in light of a recognition\nof certain facts (Badhwar 1999, 2001). Her characters reveal their\nsouls not only in what they say or do, notice or fail to notice, focus\non or evade, on this or that occasion, but in their cognitive,\nemotional, and action dispositions, their style of being in the world.\nTheir actions show not only an intellectual commitment to the right\nbut a wholehearted “love of rectitude” (1957 [1992]:\n512). \nThis basically Aristotelian view of virtue goes hand-in-hand with a\nbasically Aristotelian view of emotions. Rand rejects the\nreason-emotion dichotomy as stemming, ultimately, from a false\nmind-body dichotomy. Emotions are neither raw feelings nor inherently\nirrational but, rather, automatized value-judgments:  \nestimates of that which furthers man’s values or threatens them\n… lightning calculators giving him the sum of his profit or\nloss. (1961b: 27)  \nEmotions provide instant guidance when circumstances do not permit\nreasoning everything out anew. But our emotions are only as good as\nour reason, because they are “programmed” by our reason.\nHence they can only be corrected by conscious reasoning, and in a\nconflict between reason and emotions, one must always side with the\n former.[6] \nEudaimonists argue that Rand’s vision of a virtuous and\nhappy life in her novels can be understood only as a form of\neudaimonism, even if she sometimes makes statements\ninconsistent with this vision. The chief objection\nto eudaimonism is that, by defining a happy life partly in\nterms of virtue, it employs an unconvincing conception of\nhappiness. The philosophical literature on happiness in this sense\n(usually called well-being) makes and answers this and other such\nobjections (Annas 1993, Haybron 2008, Badhwar 2014). \nThe chief Objectivist virtues are rationality, integrity, honesty\n(with self and others), justice, independence, productiveness, and\npride. Rationality,  \none’s total commitment … to the maintenance of a full\nmental focus in all issues, in all choices … to the fullest\nperception of reality within one’s power, (1961b: 28)  \nis the basic virtue of which the other virtues are aspects or\nderivatives. The virtues are thus united or reciprocal. Each virtue is\ndefined partly in terms of a recognition of, and appropriate\nresponsiveness to, some important fact or facts, a recognition and\nresponsiveness understood by the agent to be indispensable for\ngaining, maintaining, or expressing her ultimate value. For example,\nintegrity is “the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake\nyour consciousness” (1957 [1992]: 936), a recognition that is\nexpressed in loyalty to one’s rational values and convictions,\nespecially in the face of social pressures to surrender them (1961b:\n28; 1964a: 52, 80); honesty is “the recognition of the fact that\nyou cannot fake existence”, a recognition that is expressed in\ntruthfulness in thought and speech (1957 [1992]: 936–37); and\njustice is  \nthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men\nas you cannot fake the character of nature, … that every man\nmust be judged for what he is and treated\naccordingly…. (1957 [1992]: 937) \nConspicuous by their absence from Rand’s list of the cardinal\nvirtues are the “virtues of benevolence”, such as\nkindness, charity, generosity, and forgiveness. Rand states that\ncharity is not a major virtue or moral duty (1964b); likewise,\npresumably, kindness, generosity, and forgiveness. Whether, and how\nmuch, one should help others depends on their place in one’s\nrationally defined hierarchy of values, and on the particular\ncircumstances (whether they are worthy of help, what the likely\nconsequences are of helping them, and so on). The greater their value\nvis-à-vis one’s rational self-interest, the\ngreater the help that one should be willing to give, ceteris\nparibus. What is never morally appropriate is to make a\nsacrifice, that is, to surrender something of value to oneself for the\nsake of something of less or no value to oneself. Thus, it can never\nbe moral to knowingly risk one’s life for a stranger (unless, of\ncourse, one’s life is no longer worth living) or to court\nunhappiness for the happiness of another, whether stranger or\nfriend. It is appropriate to help a stranger only in an emergency, and\nonly when the risk to our own life or well-being is minimal (1963c:\n43–45).  This should not be taken to imply that helping a\nstranger is always morally optional, regardless of the\ncircumstances. Indeed, people who are “totally indifferent to\nanything living and would not lift a finger to help a man or a dog\nleft mangled by a hit-and-run driver” are\n“psychopaths” (1963c: 43–45) Rand makes even more\nconcessions to “common sense morality” when she states\nthat it’s good to help a neighbor going through a hard time till\nhe can get back on his own feet, if we can afford to and if we have no\nreason to think that he is undeserving. Charity understood thus is a\nvirtue because it is an expression of the generalized good will and\nrespect that all normal people have towards others as creatures who\nshare with them the capacity to value (1963c: 46–47). Nathaniel\nBranden tries to reconcile charity with egoism by declaring that the\nformer stems from a species-identification with another, such that, in\nrevering others, people “are revering their own life”. By\nacting charitably, people actualize this sense of kinship, without\nsacrificing their own well-being. \nThis last is true, but the desire to reduce all proper motivations to\negoistic motivations leads Branden (and Rand and many Objectivists) to\nignore the fact that charity is first and foremost profoundly\nother-regarding, prompted by another’s plight rather than\nconcern for one’s own self-actualization. The same is true of\ntrying to rescue a dog mangled by a hit-and-run driver, where the\negoistic motivation must be even weaker, since here there is no\nspecies-identification, but rather only a\n“genus-identification” with another sufferer. \nAt any rate, the argument from identification can also be used to\njustify charity towards strangers in non-emergency situations, for\nexample, towards those who are permanently disabled and unable to care\nfor themselves (Badhwar forthcoming). Rand concedes as much in\n“What is Capitalism?” (1965) where she argues that people\nwho are unable to work must rely on voluntary charity, thus implying\nthat it is proper for those who can afford it to support strangers in\nnon-emergency situations. And indeed, as recent scholarship has\nrevealed, in her own life Rand was often extremely generous, not only\ntowards friends and acquaintances, but also\nstrangers.[7] \nThe question arises why Rand thinks that charity, kindness etc. are\nnot major virtues when they meet all the conditions of\nappropriateness: the recipient is worthy of help, one can afford to\nhelp, it is in one’s rational self-interest (or not contrary to\nit) to help, and so on. Perhaps Rand thinks that they are\n“minor” virtues because we are not obligated to act on\nthem at all times, the way we are obligated to act justly and honestly\nat all times. A deeper reason, however, might be her conception of\npeople as essentially agents rather than patients, doers rather than\nreceivers, self-sufficient rather than dependent. Nevertheless,\nRand’s view of the unity of the virtues dictates that, even if\nwe are not obligated to act on charity, kindness etc. at all\ntimes, they are just as important to possess as the other\nvirtues. Moreover, in keeping with her emphasis on the importance of\ngoodwill towards others and “the benevolent universe\npremise”, Rand’s heroes are often extraordinarily (and\nalmost always appropriately) kind and generous, not only towards those\nthey love but also towards mere acquaintances, and even sometimes\nadversaries.  Striking examples include, from The\nFountainhead, Howard Roark’s unsought-for attempt to give\nhope and courage to Steven Mallory, the gifted young sculptor whose\nfailure to get work has driven him to the verge of a spiritual and\nphysical collapse, and Roark’s unreproachful help to his\nerstwhile adversary, Peter Keating, when Keating falls on hard\ntimes. In Atlas Shrugged, Dagny offers support to a\nheart-broken and despairing Cheryl Taggart who, in the past, has\ntreated Dagny with scorn, and Hank Rearden generously supports his\nexploitative family before he realizes their \nexploitativeness.[8]\nRand’s implicit recognition that kindness and generosity are important\nvirtues is shown also in her depiction of her villains as lacking all\nkindness and generosity. \nJust as rationality, a focus on reality, is at the heart of every\nvirtue, so irrationality, evasion of reality (including\nself-deception), is at the heart of every vice. Rand’s villains\nare all master evaders motivated by a desire for power, social status,\nfame, or unearned wealth, and resentment of the good. They are\n“second-handers”—people whose primary relationship\nis to other people rather than to reality. Between the virtuous and\nthe vicious are the “innocently wrong”, people who adopt\nwrong moral principles or make wrong choices, not through evasion but\nthrough an error of judgment (Rand does not explicitly recognize any\nmoral category other than virtue, vice, and moral error, although her\nnovels portray characters that do not easily fit into any of these\ncategories). Hank Rearden, in Atlas Shrugged, is the great\ninnocent living under a burden of unearned guilt because of his\nmistaken sense of honor and a family interested only in manipulating\nand using him. Cheryl Taggart is killed by the too-sudden revelation\nthat the man she loved and admired as the embodiment of her ideals is\na fraud—and that the world is full of such frauds. \nAs already indicated, Rand justifies virtue in both instrumental and\nnon-instrumental terms, though without distinguishing between them.\nThe instrumental arguments show the existential and psychological\nrewards of virtue and costs of vice. In her depiction of her heroes,\nRand shows her conviction that virtue creates an inner harmony and\nserenity. Virtue also makes one trustworthy, and thus enables mutually\nbeneficial interactions with others.  Evasiveness, by contrast, traps\none in a “tangled web” of rationalizations and\npretenses. The evader who deceives others is either eventually caught,\nor lives in fear of getting caught, becoming dependent on\nothers’ unconsciousness. He is “a fool”, says a\ncharacter in Atlas Shrugged, “whose source of values is\nthe fools he succeeds in fooling” (1957 [1992]: 945). Further,\nlike Sartre, Rand holds that no evasion is completely successful,\nbecause the truth constantly threatens to resurface. Hence, the\nevader’s “diseased soul” is in a state of constant\ninner conflict and anxiety as he tries to suppress his awareness of\nuncomfortable truths while maintaining his hold on others. His lack of\nintegrity and of esteem for reality results in a lack of self-love or\nself-esteem and, indeed, of a solid self. (It is noteworthy, however,\nthat Rand’s portrayal of Gail Wynand in The Fountainhead is\ncloser to Aristotle’s portrayal of the vicious man in Book III\nof the Nicomachean Ethics as someone who is\n“unconscious of his vice” than to her own stated view of\nthe evader.) \nThese views are familiar from the history of philosophy, but many\nreaders find their expression in Rand’s novels to be of unusual\npsychological depth and conviction. Nevertheless, the views are\nsubject to the well-known objection that the complexity and\nvariability of human psychology and society allow only “for the\nmost part” generalizations about the existential and\npsychological benefits of virtue or costs of vice. For example, it is\npossible for a small injustice to lead to great rewards, especially\nsince others are willing to shrug off or forgive occasional\ntransgressions. It is also possible for poor introspection,\nforgetfulness, or self-acceptance to allow one to evade something\nwithout any need for supporting evasions or damage to one’s\nself-esteem. Again, even if every wrongdoing carries psychological\ncosts, these might sometimes be outweighed by the long-term\npsychological and existential costs of doing the right thing (as Rand\nherself suggests in her portrayal of the embittered Henry Cameron and\nStephen Mallory in The Fountainhead). \nThe non-instrumentalist justification of virtue in Rand’s novels\nis largely immune to these objections (though subject to the\nobjections noted in 2.4 above). To\ncompromise morally is, necessarily, to compromise one’s own\n(objectively conceived) happiness, because no existential loss can\ncompare to the loss of moral integrity. Rectitude is partly\nconstitutive of genuine happiness because it expresses the right\nrelationship to reality: to existence, to oneself, and to others. For\nthe same reason, it is partly constitutive of a self worth loving, an\nideally human or rational self. Any value gained at the price of\nrectitude is only the simulacrum of genuine value. In a variety of\nconceptually interconnected ways, then, virtuous individuals are\nnecessarily better off than those willing to take moral short-cuts. In\nits structure and much of its content, Rand’s ethical egoism is\nthus of a piece with the egoism of ancient eudaimonistic\ntheories. \nOf course, this non-instrumentalist justification of virtue depends on\nthe prior instrumentalist justification, viz., that in normal\ncircumstances (that is, in a society of more or less virtuous people),\nvirtue enables us to gain both external and psychological goods. If\njustice or kindness were systematically bad for human beings, leading\nto disease and death, they would not be virtues. If rationality\nroutinely led to an early demise, no one would value rationality. But\nthis does not entail, as Salmieri seems to think, that the ultimate\nvalue is literal survival (Salmieri 2019). All it entails is that the\nvirtues be compatible with survival in normal\ncircumstances. For it is easy to see that if justice or kindness\nsystematically led to deep depression, and rationality routinely\nsucked the joy out of life, only the rare misery-lover would value his\nlife, or the virtues. Survival is a necessary condition of a happy\nlife (as well as an unhappy one), not an ultimate value. And\nit’s only because the virtues lead to, and partly constitute, a\nhappy (eudaimonic) life, that a virtuous person considers it a greater\nloss to betray his principles than to lose the work he loves –\nor, sometimes, even his life. One of the best examples of this from\nRand’s own work is Howard Roark’s decision to act out of\nintegrity, even at the cost of being unable to practice architecture\n(The Fountainhead). Another example concerns two minor\ncharacters in We The Living who risk – and lose –\ntheir freedom and lives for resisting the new communist regime. (Note,\nhowever, that Rand does not think that we are morally obligated to\nmartyr ourselves to fight evil. All we are obligated to do is not be\ncomplicit in evil, or betray our values.) \nEven on this indirect, sophisticated egoism, where the good to the\nagent lies in being virtuous, Rand’s theory is open to the objection\noften levied against egoistic theories, viz., that they give the wrong\nreason for acting in other-regarding ways – justly, kindly, etc. My\nact does not adequately express the virtue of justice if I give you\nyour due solely or primarily because acting justly is good for me\nrather than because I recognize and respect your moral standing, your\nentitlement to be treated justly. Nor does my helping you when you\nneed help adequately express goodwill or kindness if I help you solely\nor primarily because acting benevolently is good for me. One way out\ntaken by some other theories is to argue that the\negoist’s justification is egoistic but not\nher motivation. Rand does not address the\n“wrong-reason” objection, but there is no hint in her\nwritings that she would accept this dichotomy between justification\nand motivation. The root of the problem is that, although Rand rejects\npsychological egoism, she seems to regard genuine goodwill towards, or\nlove of, others as an offshoot of proper self-love, as though there\nwere no independent source of love for others in human nature. This is\nwhere her metaethics and ethics differ most starkly from that of\nAristotle.  \nAccording to Rand, there is only one alternative to being rationally\nself-interested: sacrificing one’s proper interests, either for\nthe sake of other people (which she equates with altruism) or for the\nsake of the supernatural (which she calls mysticism) (1982a:\nch. 7). “The basic principle of altruism”, she argues,\n“is that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that\nservice to others is the only justification of his existence, and that\nself-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value”\n(“Faith and Force,” PWNI 61).  Kant’s ethics is a secularized\nmysticism insofar as it rests on categorical commands and duty for\nduty’s sake, which is to say: regardless of any earthly desire\nor interest (1970). An altruistic ethics equates right action with\nself-sacrifice for the sake of others’ good and immorality with\n“selfishness”, while saying nothing about the standard of\nthe good (“Introduction”, 1964a: iii; 1974). It thus fails\nto answer the prior question of what code of values we should follow\nand why, and provides no motivation to be moral other than guilt over\n“selfishness”. When taken to its logical conclusion,\naltruism does not simply tell us that it is “selfish” to\npursue our own desires, but also that it is “selfish to\nuphold… [our own] convictions, … [that we] must\nsacrifice them to the convictions of others” (Rand 1957 [1992]:\n943; Galt’s Speech, Rand 1961a: 142). In foreign policy,\naltruism is used to justify and gain support for America’s\nintervention in other countries (1966a). Altruism is also the reason\nwhy so many sympathize with, or even praise, bloody dictatorships that\nproudly proclaim that the sacrifice of the individual is a necessary\nand noble means to the goal of the collective good (Rand 1966a). \nAs a moral code, altruism is impractical, because its requirements are\ncontrary to the requirements of life and happiness, both the\nagent’s and other people’s. As such, it is also profoundly\nimmoral. Altruism leaves us without any moral guidance in our everyday\nlives and gives morality a bad name. \nWhat, then, is the psychological explanation for the widespread\nequation of altruism with morality? Rand suggests various explanations\nreminiscent of Nietzsche’s analysis of the psychology of\naltruism. The theorists and preachers of altruism are motivated\nlargely by a desire to control and manipulate others by playing on\ntheir guilt. Those who accept their teachings typically do so either\nbecause of guilt over their own superior achievements, or because,\nlacking any “intellectual integrity, love of truth…or a\npassionate dedication to an idea”, they have nothing much worth\nsaving, and so do not mind sacrificing themselves (“Selfishness\nWithout a Self”, 1973b; 1982a). Some altruists are altruists\nbecause their mentalities are still frozen in a tribal past when\nsurvival required the sacrifice of some for the sake of others\n(1973b). Rand herself rejects a zero-sum picture of human\nrelationships, so long as everyone in the relationship acts\nrationally. \nRand’s defense of “selfishness” (rational\nself-interest) and rejection of altruism (living for others’\nsake) are part of the reason both for her popularity with the general\nreader, and her unpopularity with philosophers and other\nintellectuals, although some would no doubt agree with her rejection\nof abject self-sacrifice and her recognition of proper concern with\nthe self as moral (Falk 1963; Gilligan 1982; Hampton 1993; Badhwar\n1993a). The general reader who responds positively to Rand’s\nwork finds, for the first time, a moral justification for pursuing a\nlife of her or his own and a liberation from “unearned\nguilt”. The philosopher who responds negatively to her work\nfinds many biased and simplistic interpretations of philosophers and\nphilosophical doctrines, including her claim that she is the first to\nconsistently defend a morality of rational self-interest, all other\nphilosophers having defended either altruism or mysticism (Pojman\n1995). Her critics also challenge her equation of altruism with abject\nself-sacrifice (Rachels 2000, Flew 1984), and her claim (explained\nbelow) that there is no conflict between people’s\nrational interests (Flew 1984).   “Force and mind are opposites; morality ends where a gun\nbegins” (Atlas Shrugged 1023). Not only actually shooting\nsomeone, but also threatening him with a gun, is an act of force. The\nnon-initiation of force against others is the basic moral principle\nguiding our interactions with others, whether in a political society,\nor in the state of nature.  It is also the basic political principle:\n“no man may initiate the use of physical force against\nothers. … Men have the right to use physical force only\nin retaliation and only against those who initiate its\nuse” (1961b, 1964a: 36). This political principle binds not only\nindividuals in their interactions with each other, but also,\nimportantly, the government. Rand’s ideal society is a society\nof independent individuals who respect each other’s rights to\nlife, liberty, and property, and who trade value for value, materially\nand spiritually.  They live, in her words, by “the trader\nprinciple”.  Individual rights and the trader principle are both\ndictated by the fact that, as rational, independent beings, we need to\nthink and act for our “proper survival” (1961b: 31). Both\nare based in human nature, and required by respect for individuals as\nends in themselves, not mere means to others’ ends. But what\nexactly is a right?  \n“Rights” are a moral concept—the concept that\nprovides a logical transition from the principles guiding an\nindividual’s actions to the principles guiding his relationship\nwith others—the concept that preserves and protects individual\nmorality in a social context—the link between the moral code of\na man and the legal code of a society, between ethics and politics.\nIndividual rights are the means of subordinating society to moral\nlaw. (1963b: 92).  \nAgain, \nThese rights are based in human nature, and are basically rights to\nactions, not to things or outcomes, and they can be violated only\nthrough the initiation or threat of force, or through fraud. Hence,\nall natural rights are negative, that is, claims on others’\nnon-interference, and not claims on them to provide one with certain\ngoods or outcomes.[9]\nThe fundamental right is the right to life:\nthe right to take the actions necessary for sustaining the life proper\nto a human being. \nThe right to life means…the freedom to take all the actions\nrequired by the nature of a rational being for the support, the\nfurtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (Such\nis the meaning of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of\nhappiness.). (1963b: 93)  \nThe right to liberty is the right to act (including to write and\nspeak) on one’s judgment; the right to the pursuit of happiness\nis the right to pursue goals for one’s own fulfillment; the\nright to property is “the right to gain, to keep, to use and to\ndispose of material values” (1963b: 94). Like the mind-body\ndichotomy, the common dichotomy between “human rights” and\nthe right to property is a false one, because to own one’s life\nis to own one’s actions and their fruits (1962b:\n 91).[10]\n Just as there is a causal and logical connection between the virtues,\nso there is between these rights: a government that violates human\nrights also violates property rights. Thus, for example, in violating\nthe right to freedom of expression by banning “obscene”\nspeech on TV, the government violates the property right of the owners\nof the TV station to use their property as they see fit. Like other\nlibertarians, both right (market) and left (egalitarian), Rand opposes\nstate regulation of morality, as well as forced service to the state,\nwhether military or civilian. She criticizes both conservatives and\nliberals (as these terms are understood in American politics) for\nwanting government to control the realm they regard as important: the\nspiritual or moral realm in the case of conservatives, and the\nmaterial or economic realm in the case of liberals (1981b). Both sides\nthus betray a lack of understanding of the fact that human beings need\nto be free in both realms to be free in either. \nCritics have pointed out that if we have rights only because we need\nthem for our survival and happiness, then we have no right to take\nactions that are contrary to our survival and happiness, such\nas blindly following a guru instead of thinking for ourselves, living\noff others because we prefer the life of a couch potato to fending for\nourselves, wasting our property instead of using it wisely, or, most\nobviously, committing suicide (Mack 1984; Zwolinski 2019). Yet the\nfreedom to do only that which is morally good or rational is no\nfreedom. But there is another interpretation of the claim that\n“The right to life means…the freedom to take all the\nactions required by the nature of a rational being for the support,\nthe furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own\nlife.” What Rand is pointing out here is that we would not have\nrights if we did not need them for our survival and happiness (Badhwar\n2017, Miller & Mossoff 2019). This need (and the fact that we\nvalue our survival and happiness) is the source of rights. If by our\nvery nature we didn’t care whether we lived or died,\ndidn’t care about being forced by the government or other people\nto act in certain ways and not others, had no use for property, and\ncouldn’t be bothered to think for ourselves, we would have no\nrights. It doesn’t follow, however, that we don’t have the\nright to act contrary to the requirements of our survival or\nhappiness. As Rand says elsewhere:  \nA right is the sanction of independent action. A right is that which\ncan be exercised without anyone’s permission (Rand 2018 83).  \n[A] right is the moral sanction of a positive, of his freedom to act\non his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own voluntary,\nuncoerced choice. (Rand 1963b 93.) \nIn spite of several statements that justify such freedom in terms of\nthe individual’s rational judgments (Rand 1965 17), it is\nthe position taken here that is compatible with Rand’s\ndeep-seated commitment to liberty and a minimal government.  \nAnother criticism of Rand’s theory of rights is that it is\nincompatible with her ethical egoism, because respect for\nothers’ rights cannot be justified as a means to the ultimate\nend of one’s survival (Mack 1984; Flew 1984). For under\nperfectly realistic scenarios, one’s survival can require one to\nviolate another’s right to life or property. Thus, according to\nthese critics, Rand’s defense of rights suffers from the same\nunresolved tension between the instrumentalist strand and the deontic\nstrand that we find in her justification of morality in general (Mack\n1984, 2003). On our eudaimonistic interpretation of\nRand’s ethical egoism and theory of rights, there is no\nincompatibility between the two. Nevertheless, as we’ve argued\nabove, both her ethical egoism and her theory of rights face the\ncriticism that the primary reason for respecting others’ rights,\nor exercising any of the other-regarding virtues, is not one’s\neudaimonia but the fact that others are ends in\nthemselves. What promotes our eudaimonia is recognizing this and\nliving accordingly, but our own eudaimonia is not the primary\nreason for respecting people’s rights.  Everything said so far shows that Rand believes that individuals\nhave rights even in a state of nature, or a society without a\ngovernment. Yet in later years, in a workshop on rights, Rand suggests\nthat rights exist only in a society with some kind of authority and a\n“formulated morality” (2018: 111). It is not clear what Rand\nmeans by “formulated morality”: a written, or at least\nexplicitly stated, morality that recognizes rights, like the Bill of\nRights in the U.S. Constitution? Or like Thomas Paine’s Rights of\nMan?? But aren’t there many societies – perhaps a majority\n– that don’t have a formulated morality yet do recognize at\nleast individuals’ basic rights against each other and the government,\nand many that can produce paper Constitutions claiming to recognize\nthese rights that, in fact, they deny their citizens? In any case,\nRand takes back her controversial statement by reiterating her earlier\nview that: \nThe source of man’s rights is not divine law or congressional\nlaw, but the law of identity. A is A and Man is Man. Rights are\nconditions of existence required by man’s nature for his proper\nsurvival (“Galt’s Speech,” Rand 1961a: 182). \n\nWhat we don’t have in the absence of a government, she says, is\nobjectively defined laws that can determine if a right has been\nviolated (2018: 211). A “proper government,” in her words,\n“is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical\nforce under objective control, i.e., under objectively defined\nlaws” (1963a: 128). \nOnkar Ghate (2019) and Harry Binswanger (2019) both defend this\nview. Ghate uses two scenarios involving individuals in a state of\nnature. Suppose you are by yourself on a desert island, and you\ndomesticate a pig. Then someone from a neighboring tribe steals it. Do\nyou have a right to retaliate by stealing some of his property, or\nstealing from his relatives? Again, suppose Robinson Crusoe and Friday\nare strangers sharing an island, and Crusoe invents a superior\nspear. Does Friday have a right to copy it? Ghate’s main point is that\nbecause individuals in his scenarios don’t have a government, they\ndon’t have objectively defined laws, and because they don’t have\nobjectively defined laws, the boundaries of their property rights are\nunclear. But Ghate does not explain why you, the pig owner, cannot\ntalk to the tribe and come up with a mutually agreeable solution, or\nwhy Crusoe and Friday can’t talk things over and decide on the\nboundaries of their rights vis-a-vis each other (if Crusoe has any\ncommon sense, he’ll encourage Friday to copy his spear and propose\nthat they cooperate in their future hunts). Of course the tribe and\nyou might not be able to reach a resolution satisfactory to both of\nyou. But that doesn’t mean that it is in principle impossible to do\nso. Neither Rand nor Ghate (2019) provide an explanation of why a\npeaceful society of people without a government cannot come up with\nobjective laws that define the boundaries of their rights – as,\nin fact, they do in Rand’s Atlantis: Galt’s Gulch. Their\nview seems to imply that if the Founding Fathers had been shipwrecked\nfor 5 years on a desert island, they could not have come up with a\nBill of Rights that defined the limits of their liberties vis-a-vis\neach other, or set up a fair system of adjudication in the event of a\ndispute. But we don’t have to engage in hypotheticals. As many\nscholars have pointed out, starting in the 11th C, merchants from\nvarious countries created the body of law called the Law Merchant in\norder to protect foreign merchants not protected by the local laws\n(Benson 1989; see the entry on law merchant at\nlibertarianism.org, linked from Other Internet Resources). The Law\nMerchant was uniform throughout Europe, and enforced by courts also\ncreated by merchants in European cities, without the involvement of\nany European government. \nRand argues that the only just social-political system, the only\nsystem compatible with our rational nature and with the right of\nindividuals to live for their own sakes, is capitalism (1965, 1967b),\nthat is,  \nlaissez-faire capitalism—with a separation of state and\neconomics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation\nof state and church. (1961b, 1964a)  \nState regulation of the market, she argues, is responsible for\ncorrupting both state and market institutions, just as political\nregulation of religion (or religious regulation of politics), wherever\nit exists, corrupts both state and religious institutions. Regulation\ncreates the opportunity for the trading of favors between politicians\nand religious leaders, and politicians and businesses. Atlas\nShrugged offers a complex and compelling depiction of the\neconomic, political, and moral corruption spawned by\n“cronyism” between government and business.\nLaissez-faire capitalism is “the only [social] system\nthat bans force from social relationships” domestically and\nabroad, because the trader and the warrior are antagonists (Rand\n1966a). Rand’s conception of capitalism is, thus, more radical\nthan the mainstream conception, and her defense of it significantly\ndifferent both from the utilitarian defenses given by most economists,\nand the religious defenses given by many conservatives (for\ndiscussion, see Den Uyl & Rasmussen 1984b; Machan 1984). She does,\nof course, praise capitalism (or semi-capitalism) for creating\nwidespread prosperity, but this feature is itself explained only by\nthe fact that it leaves individuals free to produce in peace. In\nAtlas Shrugged, Rand distinguishes between the few business\npeople who earn their money through honest effort, without seeking\nfavors from the government, and the vast majority who are members of\n“the aristocracy of pull” (“crony\ncapitalists”, in contemporary terminology) and get rich only\nthrough such favors, a situation that she thinks prevails, and has\nalways prevailed, in the real world (Rand 1964c). She holds that for a\nshort period in the nineteenth-century America came closer to a\nlaissez-faire system than any other society before or since,\nbut that capitalism remains an unknown ideal.  Some critics complain,\nhowever, that in her non-fiction (1961c) Rand does not always\nrecognize the aristocrats of pull in the real world—business\nleaders who lobby politicians for subsidies for themselves and\nrestrictions on their competitors (Rothbard 1968; Johnson 2006). \nRand rejects the criticism that unregulated, laissez-faire\ncapitalism would lead to a concentration of power in a few hands and\nundermine people’s ability to lead their own lives,\nbecause laissez-faire capitalism requires the rule of law, a\nwell-defined system of property rights, freedom of contract, and, as a\ncorollary, a government that abstains from all favoritism. In such a\nsociety, competition and opportunity will flourish, and prevent\nconcentration of power in a few hands.  \nRand holds that there is no conflict between one person’s\nrational interests and another’s, hence that there is no\nconflict between their rights (1962a, 1964a: 57–65). Is it true,\nhowever, that rational interests cannot conflict, or that, if they do,\nit follows that rights must also conflict? Our answer to both\nquestions is ‘no’. We think that whenever two or more\npeople have a rational interest in one good, there is potential for\nconflict, and sometimes that potential is actualized. To show\notherwise, Rand considers a situation in which two people apply for\nthe same job, and the better candidate gets the job. There is no\nconflict of interests here, she argues, because the better candidate\nhas earned the job, and the loser cannot rationally wish to have been\ngiven the job. Both applicants also know that competition for jobs is\na good thing, because the business would close if only one person\napplied for its jobs (presumably, because that would mean that the\nbusiness wasn’t doing very well). \nBoth points are well-taken. But what if the employer is not rational\nand gives the job to the somewhat less qualified applicant because,\nsay, he reminds the employer of his long-lost brother? Or, what if the\ntwo candidates are equally qualified, and the hiring committee chooses\none over the other by tossing a coin? In both cases there is a\nconflict of interests between two rational applicants. Rand raises the\nfirst possibility, that of the irrational employer, but doesn’t\ntrace its implications for her thesis that rational interests\ndon’t conflict. The second possibility, that of two equally\nqualified candidates, she does not consider at all. Rand would be on\nfirmer ground if she were to argue that there is no necessary\nconflict between rational interests, that is, that it is not in\ntheir nature to conflict. When they conflict, it is due to\ncontingent factors, such as only one job for two equally qualified\npeople. In any case, a conflict between rational interests does not\nentail a conflict between rights, since, as Rand herself points out,\nneither party has a right to the job. \nRand defines government as:  \nan institution that holds the exclusive power to enforce\ncertain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area. (1963a:\n125)  \nA proper government is:  \nthe means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under\nobjective control—i.e., under objectively defined law.\n(1963b: 128)  \nSuch a government is minimal, limited to protecting us from criminals\nand foreign aggressors, and enforcing individual rights and contracts\nwith the help of the police and armed forces, using objectively\ndefined civil and criminal laws and courts. Someone who violates his\ncontracts, or engages in fraud, is guilty of the\n“indirect” use of force, in that he obtains a value from\nanother without that person’s consent (1963a: 111). Accordingly,\nthe government may use or threaten force only in retaliation against\nthose who initiate or threaten force directly or indirectly. A\ngovernment that tries to enforce the brother’s keeper\nprinciple—“from each according to his ability, to each\naccording to his need”; or that drafts citizens into the armed\nservices or “public service”; or that forces them,\ndirectly or indirectly, to become more virtuous, well-mannered,\nhealthy, or wealthy, violates rights. Statism in all its forms, from\nunlimited democracy to a mixed economy to dictatorship, is at odds\nwith our status as independent, rational beings, as ends in\nourselves. Statism also destroys ability and fails to fulfill\nanyone’s needs for long, because “[t]o deal with men by\nforce is as impractical as to deal with nature by persuasion”\n(1973a: 32). The fountainhead of all progress is the human mind, and\nthe mind does not function well when forced. \nIn Atlas Shrugged Rand depicts her utopia, Galt’s\nGulch, as a “voluntary association of men held together by\nnothing but every man’s self-interest”, without any formal\norganization (1957 [1992]: 690). There is a judge to arbitrate\ndisagreements, but there has never been any need for arbitration.\nGalt’s Gulch is, thus, an anarchist society, although Rand never\ncalls it that. In “The Nature of Government”, however,\nRand rejects anarchism as irrational and unworkable because, she says,\nit is incompatible with a single, objective system of law and, thus,\nwith rights and peaceful cooperation (1963a; cf. 2018b). Anarchist\ncritics, such as Roy Childs (1969 [1994]) and Murray Rothbard (1978),\nhave argued that a territorial monopoly on law and force (government)\nis not necessary, because people can establish a just and effective\nlegal system in a competitive market of security providers (see Long\nand Machan 2009). The Law Merchant, a body of law established and\nenforced in private courts by the merchants of various countries,\nillustrates the possibility of an effective voluntary legal\nsystem. Further, a government is incompatible with Rand’s own\nprinciple of the non-initiation of force, a principle she regards as\nthe linchpin of a moral society (Long 2013; cf. Cox 2013a and\n2013b). \nThe trader principle states that a voluntary, mutually beneficial\nexchange between independent equals is the only basis for a mutually\nrespectful and rational relationship (1961b: 31). It is also the only\nbasis for a peaceful relationship among countries: “the trader\nand the warrior have been fundamental antagonists throughout\nhistory” (1966a: 38). \nThe trader principle applies to emotional relationships as well. To\nlove or admire someone is to “pay” him for the pleasure\none derives from his virtues (1961b: 31)—or, Rand might say in\nthe case of love for a small child, from his personality. It would\nseem, however, that the trade between parent and child is unequal,\ngiven that the child receives both pleasure and material support from\nthe parent. And it is unclear how the trader principle applies at all\nwhen a severe disability renders a beloved child or spouse a source of\npain rather than pleasure. \nIf feminism is the view that women are, and ought to be recognized as,\nmen’s intellectual, moral, sexual, and political equals, then\nthe Objectivist philosophy of human nature is inherently feminist,\nsince it applies equally to all human beings, regardless of gender (or\nrace) (N. Branden 1999). Decades before it was considered acceptable\nfor women to lack “maternal instincts” or pursue careers,\nRand created heroines who lack the first and pursue the second, free\nof guilt or\n self-doubt.[11]\n Kira (We the Living) wants to be an engineer, and Dagny\n(Atlas Shrugged) runs Taggart Transcontinental, the largest\nand most successful transcontinental railroad in the country. None of\nRand’s heroines sacrifices her interests, intellect, or\nprinciples for the man or men in her life. One literary critic argues\nthat Dagny is the first, and perhaps only, epic heroine in Western\nliterature because of the grandness of her vision, her courage and\nintegrity, her unusual abilities, and her national importance\n(Michalson 1999). Rand’s depiction of her heroines’\nenjoyment of sex and their freedom from all merely conventional norms\nabout sex anticipates the sexual liberation movement of the\n20th century by at least 30 years. In all three novels, it\nis the heroine who has the power to choose which of the men who love,\nadmire, and desire her (and only her) she will have. Rand was also an\nardent champion of a woman’s right to control her own\nreproductive choices (1968a, 1981). \nHer relationship to the feminist movement, however, was more complex.\nAlthough she praised Betty Friedan’s The Feminine\nMystique, mainstream feminism’s collectivism and emphasis\non women as victims later led her to reject feminism as such. Many\ntheorists argue that Rand’s work, especially Atlas\nShrugged, upholds important feminist ideals, even as it succumbs\nto some anti-feminist tendencies that contradict her individualistic\nethics (e.g., Gladstein 1978, 1999; B. Branden 1999; Presley 1999;\nSheaffer 1999; Taylor 1999). Many others regard her and her work as\nplainly anti-feminist, with Susan Brownmiller even calling her\n“a traitor to her own sex” (Brownmiller 1975). One\ncriticism takes aim at the individualism of Rand’s ethics and\npolitics, which rejects any special government help for women or\ndiscrimination against men (e.g., Harrison 1978). Another objects that\nRand has internalized a masculine conception of human nature and\nvirtue, and then created her ideal woman in light of this conception\n(Brownmiller 1975; Glennon 1979). This may be responsible for\nRand’s puzzling (and offensive) view that the essence of\nfemininity is to hero-worship (not men, but) masculinity, while\ninsisting (as her novels depict) that women and men are inherently\nequal and that the ideal romantic relationship is between moral and\nintellectual equals (1968b; cf. Brown 1999). At least as offensive to\nmany are the violent sex scenes in her novels, especially the infamous\nscene in The Fountainhead that many regard as rape, where\nHoward Roark has sex with Dominique in spite of her resistance. \nThose who reject the charge of rape argue that in the 1940s and 50s,\nwhen Rand wrote her novels, it would have been seen as rough sex\nrather than non-consensual sex (McElroy 1999; Sheaffer 1999). That\nRand herself thought of this scene as consensual is shown a few pages\nlater, when she writes: “They had been united in an\nunderstanding beyond the violence, beyond the deliberate obscenity of\nhis action” (1943: 218). And in letters to disturbed readers in\n1946 and 1965, Rand denied that the scene is “actual rape”\nwhich, she stated, is “a dreadful crime”, a “vicious\naction and a violation of a woman’s rights” (Rand 1995a).\nOn the other hand, she also depicts Dominique exultantly telling\nherself that she’s been raped. McElroy wonders if having her\nheroine call it rape is just another instance of Rand’s desire\nto provoke and shock the reader (McElroy 1999), as when she uses\n“selfishness” to mean “rational\nself-interest”. \nRand holds that our actions need guidance by a vision of the\nfundamental nature of the universe and of the efficacy of human\nthought and activity—a vision that can be grasped directly\nrather than requiring the conscious repetition of long chains of\nabstract reasoning. The chief function of art is to meet this\npsychological need by expressing abstract conceptual values and\nmetaphysical truths in concrete perceptible form. Art, according to\nRand, constitutes a selective, stylized re-creation of reality, with\nthe principle of selection being the artist’s “sense of\nlife”, a set of implicit “metaphysical\nvalue-judgments”, i.e., judgments about what is fundamentally\nsignificant about the world and our place in it. (There is controversy\namong Rand scholars as to whether what is re-created in art is certain\nelements of reality or reality as a whole, i.e., a\n“microcosm”, as well as how and whether the concept of\nre-creation applies to apparently non-representational forms of art:\nTorres and Kamhi 2000; Bissell 2004.) Both the artist’s creative\nwork and the audience’s emotional responses to it are driven by\ntheir senses of life, that is, the worldviews they have “formed\nby a process of emotional generalization … a subconscious\ncounterpart of a process of abstraction” (1966b: 27). The role\nof art in sustaining us psychologically by providing a concretization\nof our most fundamental values is a frequent theme in Rand’s\nfiction as well, especially The\n Fountainhead.[12] \nWhile art can be used to convey information or to advocate a position,\nsuch functions are secondary to its chief task: providing an object\nwhose mere contemplation brings spiritual fulfillment. Hence Rand does\nnot regard her own novels primarily as vehicles for her philosophy,\nthough of course they are that inter alia. Given her own\nworldview, Rand favors literature with a strong plot as a way of\nexpressing purposeful human action in a world of causal regularity,\nand stories involving value-conflicts as a way of expressing the\nimportance of free choice; hence her preference for romantic (as\nopposed to, e.g., naturalistic) literature. But Rand holds that it is\npossible to evaluate an artwork’s aesthetic value simply in\nterms of its success in conveying a concretization of the\nartist’s sense of life, whether or not one shares the values and\njudgments so conveyed.","contact.mail":"longrob@auburn.edu","contact.domain":"auburn.edu"}]
