It is the first or second leading\ncause of death before age 70 in ninety-one countries, as of 2015.\nAccording to the International Agency for Research on Cancer,\n“there will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases and\n9.6 million cancer deaths in 2018,” and cancer is expected to be\nthe “leading cause of death in every country of the world in the\n21st century” (Bray, et al. 2018).  While overall cancer\nmortality has declined in the U.S. annually since 2005, progress has\nbeen slow in some cases, and mortality is rising in others.  In\nparticular, “death rates rose from 2010 to 2014 by almost 3% per\nyear for liver cancer and by about 2% per year for uterine\ncancer,” and, “pancreatic cancer death rates continued to\nincrease slightly (by 0.3% per year) in men” (Siegel, et al.\n2017). Perhaps not surprisingly, then, cancer is a central topic of\nbiomedical research, drawing millions of federal dollars annually. In\n2019, the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) will allocate $5.74\nbillion in federal dollars, a $79 million increase over 2018 (NCI,\n2019—see the Other Internet Resources).  A search for the term\n“cancer” in PubMed returns over three million hits.\n\n\n\nDespite this, cancer—and scientific research on cancer—has\nreceived relatively little attention from philosophers of\nscience. However, this is starting to change, as cancer, and\nscientific research on cancer, raises a variety of compelling\nphilosophical questions. This entry will focus on four topics, which\nphilosophers of science have begun to explore and debate.\n\n\n\nFirst, scientific classifications of cancer have as yet failed to\nyield a unified taxonomy. There is a diversity of classificatory\nschemes for cancer, and while some are hierarchical, others appear to\nbe “cross-cutting,” or non-nested. Initially, researchers\ninvestigating cancer genomics seemed to think such issues might be\nresolved by molecular “subtyping”. However, genomic\nsequencing and its sequelae—transcriptomics, proteomics,\nepigenomics, etc.—have, if anything, complicated cancer\nclassification. This literature thus raises a variety of questions\nabout the nature of the disease and disease classification: Are there\nsome classifications that are more useful, or better than others? What\nmakes a classification a good one? What does it mean to track more or\nless “natural” distinctions in the context of disease? Is\nsuch talk of the “naturalness” of disease categories\nsimply confused? The problem of cancer classification is complicated\nby the fact that cancer progression is a process with a complex\nnatural history. Thus, cancer serves as a challenging case for disease\nclassification, and also for demarcating disease from health, raising\nintriguing questions about the potential role(s) of precautionary\nvalues in cancer diagnosis.\n\n\n\nSecond, philosophers of science have historically taken the aim of\nscience to be arriving at true theories. However, scientists studying\ncancer come from a variety of disciplines, with different scientific\nas well as practical aims. Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that\nhistorians and philosophers of science do not seem to agree on how\nbest to characterize the aim and structure of cancer research; it is\nfar from clear whether the appropriate characterization of the aim is\narriving at true theories, or even whether the proper units of\nanalysis are “theories”, or instead, “models”,\n“explanatory frameworks”, “research programs”,\n“paradigms”, or perhaps, “experimental\ntraditions”. With the rise of “big data”\nscience—such as the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (or\nTCGA)—and “systems” approaches to the study of\ndisease, both philosophers and historians of science are rethinking\nhow best to describe and explain these distinctive kinds of scientific\ninquiry.\n\n\n\nThird, cancer is in part a byproduct of our developmental and life\nhistory, as well as our evolutionary history. Cancer progression\ncan be compared to a reversion of development, or, to the evolution of\nmulticellularity. Thus, cancer raises intriguing questions about how\nwe conceive of “functions”, “development”, and\nthe role of our evolutionary history and particularly, selective\ntrade-offs, in vulnerability to disease. \n\n\n\nLast but not least, cancer research provides a case study for\nconsideration of the roles of values at the science-policy interface.\nEpidemiological and toxicological research on cancer’s causes\ninforms toxics law and regulatory policy, which raises a variety of\nquestions about the nature of evidence and inductive risk in such\ncontexts. Cancer research also provides a test case for debates about\nthe challenges facing translational medicine and precision medicine.\nMoreover, the complexity of cancer causation provides an opportunity\nand a challenge for those who take data and theoretical integration to\nbe an ideal for science. With so many, and such diverse types of\ncancer research, integration presents many challenges. Indeed, this is\none of the many reasons why translating “basic” science\ninto the clinic can be enormously difficult.\n\n\nWhat is cancer? Is cancer one disease, or many? If many, how many\ncancers are there? One might think that such questions are merely\nempirical. However, it turns out that defining and classifying cancer\nis contested, for at least two reasons. First, there is little\nagreement on how to classify disease, more generally. Second, cancer\nitself poses a variety of challenges—both in terms of its\nintrinsic heterogeneity, and in light of its variable natural history.\nIn section 1.1, we will consider challenges facing cancer\nclassification in light of cancer’s intrinsic heterogeneity, and\nin section 1.2, we will consider challenges facing cancer\nclassification in light of its variable natural history. \n\nPrima facie, what distinguishes diseases are typical symptoms, disease\ncourse, and a common cause. The last criterion—common\ncause—is inherited from a model of disease classifications that\ngrew in part out of the successes of the germ theory of disease\n(Carter 2003). Following Koch’s postulates (1884), what enables\none to distinguish diseases is the ability to isolate a causal agent\nas present in each and every case of characteristic symptoms.\nUnfortunately, such a model of disease is not terribly helpful for\ncancer. Cancer can be present without clinically detectable symptoms,\nhas variable disease course, and is a “multifactorial”\ndisease—there are many causes of cancer. It is rather difficult\nto pick out a “causal bottleneck” uniquely necessary for\ncancer, let alone each cancer type and subtype. While cancers are\ntypically classified by their cell-of-origin—or the tissue, or\norgan, and cell-type where they originated (e.g., squamous cell\ncarcinoma of the skin or ovaries), it turns out that cancers can\ncontain mixes of different cells of origin, and cancers arising in the\nsame cells or tissues can have very different features. Moreover,\ncancers with many of the same features (at least initially), may\nevolve in different ways, and have different vulnerability to\ntreatment (Marusyk, et al. 2012). How, then, are we to classify such\npoorly behaving kinds? \n\nClassifications of cancer have largely been in service of diagnosis,\nprognosis, and treatment decisions. Oncologists, surgeons and\npathologists typically classify cancer types and subtypes, in light of\norgan and tissue type of origin (such as leukemia, or glioma), broadly\nshared signs and symptoms, disease course, gross histopathology (size,\nshape and rate of division of cells), and “biomarkers”\n(e.g., estrogen sensitivity, genetic profile). Solid tumors (of the\nlung, for instance) may be classified as either “benign,”\nor “malignant,” and malignant cancers can present at\ndifferent “stages” and have different “grades.”\nPathologists use various measures (e.g., size, extent of lymphatic\ninvolvement, number of metastases, number of lymphocytes (white blood\ncells)) to estimate stage of progression of the disease.\n“Grade” is a term used to classify solid tumors in light of\nother measures (e.g., degree of “dedifferentiation” of\ncells in a tumor—or loss of characteristics typical of a\nbreast, prostate, or colon cells and tissue) and is taken to indicate\nlikely disease course. Decisions about staging criteria are\nconventionally agreed upon by specialists in oncology and pathology,\nthough informed by the best available evidence. Early stage disease can\nbe very difficult to classify, and thus also to know whether (or how)\ntreat. And, some cancers seem particularly recalcitrant to treatment.\nThis led researchers to ask: Are there distinctive genetic or molecular\n“signatures” of each cancer that can help us estimate risk\nof progression, or chances of recurrence, as well as predict responses\nto treatment? Perhaps these molecular signatures are the key to a\nnatural taxonomy of cancer types and subtypes? \n\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, a federally funded U.S.\nresearch program, supported jointly by the National Cancer Institute\n(NCI) and National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), sought to\ncharacterize the genomic features of each cancer type and subtype,\nresulting in thirty-three “marker” papers, laying out\nmolecular features of each cancer type, often yielding novel\nsubclassifications of each type. For example, in 2016, a working group\naffiliated with TCGA published “Comprehensive Pan-Genomic\nCharacterization of Adrenocortical Carcinoma,” which identified\nthree subtypes of adrenocortical carcinoma, and in 2015, another\nworking group published “Comprehensive Genomic Characterization\nof Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas,” which identified\nspecific mutations associated with human-papillomavirus-associated\nversus smoking-related head and neck cancers. While TCGA did result in\na more comprehensive understanding of cancer biology, it also raised\nmany questions. One particular challenge has been determining which\nmutations to which genes are the “drivers” of cancer, or\nwhich ones enable cancer cells to “succeed” in an\nenvironment that would (ordinarily) prevent their growth. Cancer\ngenomes have many mutations, so a central puzzle has been determining\nwhich among the many changes to cancer genomes are causally relevant\nto cancer progression. Solving this puzzle has been difficult, because\ncancers are far more heterogeneous than they initially\nanticipated. Or, perhaps it is better to say: sorting the\n“signal” from the noise has proven more difficult than\nanticipated, as Meyerson, et al. (2010) explains, paraphrasing\nTolstoi: \n\n… normal human genomes are all alike, but every cancer genome\nis abnormal in its own way. Specifically, cancer genomes vary\nconsiderably in their mutation frequency,… in global copy\nnumber or ploidy, and in genome structure… (Meyerson,\net al. 2010) \n\nIn other words, there are very different rates, numbers and types of\nmutations across and within different cancer types and subtypes. Which\nones matter, how, and how much, in different cancer types and\nsubtypes, and indeed, over the course of cancer progression, is a\ndifficult puzzle to solve. Complicating this further, a cancer may\ncontain several subpopulations of cells (or, multiple evolving\nlineages), with different numbers and types of mutations within each\nlineage. That is, cancers have varying types and degrees of\n“intratumor heterogeneity.” So, samples of a tumor taken\nwhen cancer is first diagnosed may be representative of only one\nsubpopulation of an early stage of a dynamic process. Such samples may\nnot be representative of the genomic changes of greatest relevance to\ntreatment-resistant late stage disease. Yet, it is late-stage disease\nthat we need better tools to more effectively intervene upon; most\ncancers—if caught early—can be treated relatively\neffectively. \n\nAll this would be challenging enough as it is, but there is a yet\nfurther challenge to cancer classification. Cancers arising in the\nsame tissue or organ can be more genetically dissimilar than cancers\narising in different tissues or organs. Or, “cell-of-origin\ninfluences, but does not fully determine, tumor classification”\n(Hoadley, et al. 2014, 2018). Genomic information, far from providing\na way to sort all cancers into a Linnean hierarchy, instead yields\nwhat philosophers have called cross-cutting classifications (Khalidi,\n1998). One might think genetic profile should trump tissue or cell of\norigin for purposes of classification. But it turns out that where a\ncancer arises in the body is rather important to know. Characteristics\nof the tissues and organs in which a cancer arises shape the course of\ndisease in a complex fashion (Öhlund, et al. 2017; Fessler, et\nal. 2016).  Moreover, the rise of epigenomics, proteomics, and\ntranscriptomics, and “regulomics” generates further\nchallenges with classification, suggesting genomic information needs\nto be supplemented. For instance, it turns out changes in microRNA in\ncancer cells—non-coding RNA, which affects the expression of\ngenes—can affect cancer initiation, progression, and responses\nto drugs (Hrovatin, et al. 2018). This is just one of several\n“extra-genomic” factors that play an important role in\ncancer causation and thus, presumably, ought to play at least a\npartial role in informing cancer taxonomy. \n\nThis does not exhaust all factors of causal relevance to cancer onset,\nand thus also (at least potentially) classification. Family history\nand inherited (as opposed to somatic) mutations, life history\n(e.g. parity, or number of children, and age at first birth),\nenvironmental exposures, and histories of infection, inflammation, and\nimmune response, contribute differentially to cancer’s age of\nonset, rate of progression, histopathology, and response to treatment.\nFor instance, infectious agents (e.g., HPV- or HCV-) are associated\nwith cervical and liver cancers, and some proportion of esophageal\ncancers (Cancer Genome Atlas, 2015). Cancers of the prostate and\nbreast are associated with hormonal environments, which are in turn\naffected by parity (number of\npregnancies). “Pregnancy-associated” breast cancers are\ncancers that arise during or shortly after pregnancy (see, e.g.,\nSchedin 2006). The “same” cancer in the same tissue or\norgan can be classified as either “somatic,” or\n“familial”—due in part to whether the patient\npossesses inherited mutations, such as those with Li Fraumeni\nsyndrome.  Smoking associated lung cancers and non-smoking associated\nlung cancers are distinct genetically, epigenetically, and\nphenotypically (i.e., in terms of both gross pathology, and course of\nprogression, as well as response to treatment). Which of these several\ncausal factors ought to figure centrally in classification? Depending\nupon how fine-grained a characterization of the causal basis of cancer\none adopts, there could be hundreds or thousands of cancer types and\nsubtypes. It’s far from clear whether there is one obvious\nchoice of causal basis that best reflects anything like a\n“natural” division of type and subtypes. Indeed, this case\nraises the larger question of whether one can or should expect a\nunivocal classification of multifactorial disease, or indeed, of\ndisease more generally. Are diseases, such as cancer,\n“natural” kinds? Or, are they simply ways of carving up\nthe world that we happen to find useful? Is the\n‘naturalness’ of a classification in science a matter of\ndegree? \n\nSeveral philosophers have weighed in on the matter of the nature of\ndisease and disease classification (see, e.g., Ereshefsky, et al. 2015;\nLange 2007; Broadbent 2009 and 2015; Williams 2011; Khalidi 2013;\nSorenson 2011). The questions these authors are addressing are both\nepistemic—what warrants choice of criteria of classification of\ndisease—and metaphysical—given diseases like cancer lack\n“essential” properties, is it correct to think of disease\n“kinds” as “natural”? \n\nLange (2007) for instance, argues that, “a disease is a natural\nkind of incapacity that features in interesting function-analytic\nexplanations of other unhealthful incapacities”(Lange, 2007,\n266). Cancer is not a “natural kind,” in his view, because\nthe “typical patterns of disruption of cell birth and\ndeath” characteristic of cancer are multiply\nrealized. Categories like “breast cancer” or “lung\ncancer” seem to be increasingly replaced in modern medicine by\nappeal to molecular subtypes. Molecular subtypes of cancer are not,\nhowever, “natural kinds of incapacity,” on Lange’s\nview, and so are not distinct diseases. Indeed, many “disease\nkinds” lack unifying “function-analytic”\nexplanations. Thus, modern medicine has, in a sense, led to the\n“end of diseases” as natural kinds. In a similar vein, but\nfor very different reasons, Sorenson (2011) argues that diseases are\n“para-natural” kinds.  Insofar as diseases are\n“deficiencies,” or “departures from the norm,”\nthey lack the “integrity” or “internal nature”\ncharacteristic of natural kinds. Diseases are\n“reflections” of natural kinds of process. They\n“inherit the lawfulness and projectability of the natural kinds\nthat shape them.” In other words, both Lange and Sorenson seem\nsimilarly skeptical that diseases are natural kinds. \n\nIn contrast, while Broadbent (2009, 2015), Williams (2011), and\nKhalidi (2013) agree that diseases lack essential properties, they\nclaim that disease classifications in light of distinctive causes, or\ntypes of cause, either pick out distinctive “deviations from\nnormal functional ability,” or (in Khalidi's case) homeostatic\nproperty cluster kinds. For instance, Broadbent’s (2009, 2015)\n“contrastive” model of disease classification roughly\ntakes diseases to be distinct in light of distinctive causes. Where\nthere is a difference in at least one of a set of causes shared by\n“controls” and “cases” (where cases are\nidentified in light of “parts and processes deviating\n(negatively) from normal functional ability”), we have a\ndistinct disease. Broadbent takes this account to explain why, for\ninstance, “cervical cancer is a disease, but HPV-itis is\nnot.” Though, it’s not clear that HPV-itis is not properly\nregarded as a legitimate disease category; or, at least, this case\nraises an interesting question as to whether potential, rather than\novert, dysfunction is more central to disease designation. In public\nhealth contexts, whether a strain of HPV causes cancer or not is not\nas important as deploying interventions that limit the spread of HPV\nmore generally. Strains of HPV that do not currently cause cancer\ncould well evolve the capacity to do so. So, perhaps from a public\nhealth perspective, “HPV-itis” is a perfectly legitimate\ndisease category. That is, from a preventive medicine perspective,\nwhat matters is that a disease category is a good one for predicting\nand intervening, even where functional disruption does not always (or\neven most of the time) eventuate. Which choice of classification we\nought to make in demarcating disease types, in other words, might\ndepend on not only on which contrast we are interested in explaining\nretrospectively, but also which kind of intervention we wish to\npromote prospectively. \n\nKhalidi (2013) argues that cancer might be a homeostatic property\ncluster kind. Khalidi argues that cancer is driven by\n“homeostatic” mechanisms—namely, mutations to\n“caretaker” genes, or genes that play a\n“gatekeeping” role in preventing or permitting the\nemergence of a tumor. Acquisition of mutations to specific\n“caretaker” genes, on this view, serve a function akin to\nBoyd’s (1999) “homeostatic mechanisms,” in that they\npermit the further acquisition of “hallmark” properties of\ncancer cells. Khalidi is drawing upon a very common view of cancer,\narticulated by two famous cancer researchers, Hanahan and Weinberg\n(2000, 2011). They identify what they take to be the\n“hallmarks” of cancer: “a small number of molecular,\nbiochemical, and cellular traits—acquired\ncapabilities—shared by most and perhaps all types of human\ncancer.” They identified these “six essential alterations\nin cell physiology that collectively dictate malignant growth”\nas: self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth\nsignals, evasion of apoptosis (cell death), sustained angiogenesis (the\nability to develop a blood supply), tissue invasion and metastasis\n(Hanahan, et al. 2000, 57). By way of example of a caretaker,\nTP53 is called a tumor suppressor, because it carries the\nfunction of sensing and responding to signals associated with cell\ndamage, typically inducing apoptosis, or cell death. It is one of the\nonly genes mutated in a majority of cancers sequenced (Bailey, et al.\n2018), and Weinberg (2013) characterizes it as “master guardian\nand executioner,” in that it prevents further mutations by\ninducing cell death where there are signs of trouble. On\nKhalidi’s view, one ought to understand disruption of these very\nspecific capacities as a “homeostatic mechanism” for\ncancer. \n\nAt first blush, this seems a vivid case of a homeostatic property\ncluster kind. However, demarcating mechanisms is far from\nstraightforward. Where we take a mechanism to begin and end is in\nlarge part a pragmatic matter (Craver 2009); so, depending upon how we\ncarve up the “homeostatic mechanisms for” cancer, we can\nyield many or few cancer subtypes. As perhaps may have been expected,\nHanahan and Weinberg’s initial picture has been complicated\nsince 2001. In 2011, Hanahan and Weinberg updated their hallmarks to\ninclude four more: “genome instability, which generates the\ngenetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation,\nwhich fosters multiple hallmark functions… reprogramming of\nenergy metabolism, and evading immune destruction.” And,\n“In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension\nof complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly\nnormal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by\ncreating the tumor microenvironment” (2011, 646). In other\nwords, hallmarks of cancer appear to no longer involve all and only\nintrinsic properties of cancer cells, but also dynamic interactions\nbetween cancer cells and the immune system and extra-tumor\nenvironment. This may not be such a serious challenge to\nKhalidi’s view that caretaker mutation are mechanisms for\ncancer; one could, arguably, just expand the mechanisms for\nhomeostasis to the tumor microenvironment. However, such a strategy is\ncomplicated by the context-sensitivity of mechanism activation. Many\ncells on the surface of the skin as we age possess as many mutations\nto “caretaker” genes as those in a breast tumor, but most\nsuch skin cells are shed (Martincorena, et al. 2015). The\n“same” mechanisms may well lead to harm in one context,\nand be entirely harmless in another. \n\nThe larger concern cases like this raise is whether there is one way\nto privilege choice of causal basis for classifying diseases like\ncancer. Different choice of temporal or spatial scale, or more or less\nfine-grained characterization of causal processes, might yield\nmultiple, overlapping disease classifications.  While some may be\nwilling to bite this bullet, and indeed, endorse pluralism and\nnon-hierarchical classifications (see, e.g., Khalidi 1998, 2013),\nothers might be concerned that this would yield too permissive an\narray of disease types. More generally, whether and how scientific\nresearchers and clinicians are likely to to converge on a common\nclassification for cancer raises some interesting puzzles about the\naims and methods of classification in the biomedical sciences more\ngenerally. That genomic features of cancer are unlikely to\nunproblematically yield a natural taxonomy suggests that a reductive\npicture of disease classification is more generally implausible.  It\nseems that classifications of disease like cancer form a kind of\n‘hybrid’—they are intended to capture natural\nregularities and their causes, but also to be of use for a wide array\nof agents with different purposes. It’s unclear whether all\nthese purposes can be served by one univocal method or set of\nclassificatory criteria. \n\nOne further complication surrounding classification in the case of\ncancer, is that cancers have variable disease course (Foulds 1958;\nCairns 1975; Lynch 2007; Bertolaso & Dupré 2018). Not all\ncancers progress uniformly to metastasis and death; some growths\nprogress slowly or not at all. Some very common cancers (in the\nprostate and thyroid) are either slow growing, or tend to remain\n“indolent” (Esserman, et al. 2013; Siegel, et al.\n2017). There is some disagreement in the medical community about how\nto characterize such cases; it’s unclear in many cases whether\nthey are best viewed as very slow growing precancerous lesions, or\nperhaps ought not be characterized as “cancer” at\nall. Such cases raise a host of practical questions about the merits\nof screening, and the risk of overdiagnosis—the diagnosis of\ndisease that might never have progressed in the lifetime of the\npatient (see, e.g., Walker & Rogers 2016; Hofman 2017; Esserman,\net al. 2013; Welch & Black 2010), but they also raise interesting\nphilosophical questions about the nature of disease. \n\nSome philosophers (Schwartz 2014), drawing upon the biostatistical\ntheory of disease as departure from age and sex-typical function\n(Boorse 1977), argue that we ought to classify such early stage\ncancers as risk factors, rather than disease. Such growths are not\ndisease, on this view, because they are not atypical and do not as yet\nimpair function—in fact as many as one half of men over 60 have\nsome lesions the prostate (Welch & Black 2010). Reclassification of\nsuch cancers as mere risk factors, it’s hoped, will prevent\noverdiagnosis and overtreatment. Other philosophers less sympathetic to\nthe biostatistical approach (e.g., Reid 2016) argue that this approach\nfails to acknowledge how the practice of diagnosis is itself a sort of\nrisk-benefit calculation, informed in part by our knowledge of the\nprevalence of early stage growths like DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ),\nor indolent prostate disease, and in part by more or less precautionary\nvalues. As we’ve learned how common such indolent diseases are,\nwith the growing realization that many such growths do not progress, it\nseems that they fall into some further (and less well-defined)\ncategory. It seems this debate is not only a scientific or empirical\none, but also a normative one; much like debates about PTSD or obesity,\nthere are normative dimensions to how we define and classify disease.\nLabeling can have both positive and negative consequences for patients,\nclinicians, insurers, not to mention developers and producers of\nscreening, medical device, and pharmaceuticals (Ereshefsky 2009).\nOverdiagnosis of early stage disease can lead to serious harms; not\nleast, treating a “cancer” that may or may not progress in\nthe lifetime of a patient is costly and harmful to quality of life. \n\nOne hope driving the precision medicine research program is that the\nidentification of biomarkers of aggressive disease will resolve these\nambiguities with respect to early stage disease, as well as identify\ntargets of effective treatment (see, e.g., Collins, et al. 2005).\nHowever, as we have seen, interpreting genomic data has been far from\nstraightforward, and classifying cancer types and subtypes by appeal to\ngenomic information alone can lead to a loss of important information.\nWhile genomic and molecular data is no doubt useful, it is not\nnecessarily decisive. \n\nIn sum, much like genes and species, diseases like cancer lack\nessences, are heterogeneous, blur together at the edges, are caused in\nmany different ways, and have variable dynamics. Perhaps inconsistent\nclassifications are simply to be expected in such cases. That this is\nso does not (necessarily) show that we ought to give up on realism\nabout disease kinds; indeed, perhaps we ought to endorse\n“promiscuous realism” (Dupré 1996). As knowledge\nhas grown, and practical interests shift, on this view, classifications\ncan multiply and even cross-classify the same kinds. This is nothing to\nfear, so long as the kinds we countenance do the predictive or\nexplanatory work intended for them, in the context intended. Others\nhave a somewhat less permissive view, however, arguing that there need\nto be some empirical constraints or other on classification of\n“scientific kinds,” whether or not these categories count\nas examples of “natural” kinds (Slater 2014; Ereshefsky,\net al. 2015). For instance, Ereshefsky, et al. (2015)\nargue that all and only categories that serve the needs of\n“progressive” research programs are legitimate. \n\nGiven the complex causal pathways and heterogeneity of cancer,\nperhaps it is not surprising that, as Bertolaso (2016) argues, the\nhistory of attempts to identify defining features of cancer, let alone\narrive at a unified theory, have floundered. Either cancer is defined\nso vaguely as to include non-pathological states, or focused so\nnarrowly on a specific class of causes as to rule out cases that might\notherwise be included. Among the many definitions she canvases are:\n“abnormal proliferation,” “unregulated growth,”\n“a disease of cell differentiation rather than\nmultiplication,” “the result of destruction of tissue\narchitecture,” “a systems biology disease,”\n“blocked ontogeny,” a disease of “suppressed (sic)\nimmune function,” a “metabolic” and of course, a\n“genomic” disease. Such a variety of definitions is,\nBertolaso argued, due to the fact that cancer has many causes, and many\neffects; moreover, it involves many different types of dysregulation,\nat a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Suffice it to say, it is\nno small challenge to identify defining features of cancer, let alone\narriving at a unified “theory” of disease etiology. \n\nOne might well ask, however, whether the lack of a unified theory of\ncancer is a cause for concern? Is this a sign of immature science?\nKincaid has argued to the contrary (2008), “biomedical science\ncan make significant progress without precise definitions of disease,\nwithout full-fledged theories of disease and of normal biological\nfunctioning, and without disease entities being natural\nkinds” (p. 368). Pointing out how tumor microenvironment shapes\nhow cancer cells behave as they do, Kincaid argues that “There is\nno clear definition of what constitutes a cancerous cell in terms of\nnecessary and sufficient conditions. However, no one thinks that cancer\nresearch should stop until we get this definition settled, or that\ncreating linguistic uniformity is important for understanding the\nscience. The science certainly makes progress nonetheless…\nLikewise, there is no parsimonious theory of the disease and the normal\nfunctioning from which it is a deviation. Instead, we have piecemeal\ncausal explanations” (p. 373). Kincaid is correct. Much of cancer\nresearch is piecemeal in character, offering partial and locally\nconstrained characterizations of the loss or promotion of some\nparticular activity of a cell associated with this or that mutation\ntypical of cancer cells. Whether we require a unified theory of cancer\nremains an open question. Or, at least, the question of what function\nsuch a unified theory might serve is a matter of some debate. This is\nreflected in the fact that the research program seeking to identify\ngenetic mechanisms associated with cell birth and death has received so\nmany different names: the “oncogene paradigm,” (Bishop\n1995; Morange 1997) “vision,” (Morange 1997),\n“theory,” (Sonnenschein & Soto 2008),\n“model” (Temin 1974; Vogelstein & Kinzler 1993),\n“theory-method package” (Fujimura 1988, 1992), and\nrecently, “framework” (Blassime, et al. 2013). \n\nOne suggestion that seems plausible is that a better way of framing\nthe project of cancer research involves commitment to an\n“explanatory framework.” For instance, Blassimie, et al.\n(2013) characterize the search for oncogenes as an “explanatory\nframework”: “causal patterns, schemata (in the sense of\nDarden 2002), intuitions, hypotheses, evidential standards and various\nbits of evidence and data coming from different experimental settings\nand instrumental devices,” which “establish selective and\nlocal criteria of causal relevance that drive the search for,\ncharacterization and use of biological mechanisms.” Rather than\nconsisting of sets of laws or general principles, such frameworks help\ngenerate strategies in the search for causes, and narrow the field of\ninquiry. Blassime, et al. argue that “explanatory frameworks\nallow for changes of scientific perspective on the causal relevance of\nmechanisms without necessarily fully replacing previous explanatory\nframeworks” (p. 375). Explanatory frameworks, in other words, can\n“coexist” or be “gradually displaced,” rather\nthan stand in mutually exclusive relations with one another. As new\nquestions arose, and new information was discovered, this explanatory\nframework became elaborated; depending upon how permissive or\nrestrictive our characterization of this framework, it need not be\nviewed as at odds with, for instance, attention to the tissue\nmicroenvironment in cancer. This sort of multifaceted approach is\nperhaps what one ought to expect for such a heterogeneous disease,\nwhere causes and effects can be described at very different temporal\nand spatial scales. Much like other complex, multifactorial diseases,\ncancer is not a single phenomenon, but a heterogeneous class of\ndisease processes, with few definitive properties or unique\ncauses. This makes not only classification, but also explanation,\nenormously difficult, as we will see below. \n\nWhat does it mean to explain cancer? The question is ambiguous, and\nfraught. For, by “cancer” one could have several targets\nof explanation in mind: the transformation of a cell into a\n“cancer cell,” the (general) process of carcinogenesis,\nthe process of invasion and metastasis in solid tumors, the emergence\nand roles of intratumor heterogeneity, differential rates of incidence\nof different cancer types, patterns of cancer incidence or mortality\nin different environments, socioeconomic groups, races, ages, or\nsexes. Each of these explanatory targets arguably calls for quite\ndifferent kinds of explanation and not only different\nexplanatory information. Cancer scientists make appeals to\ngeneralizations of wide scope, for instance, and will also offer\ndetailed, specific mechanistic explanations of specific outcomes. The\nfact that these explanations are different in kind may (in part)\nexplain why there appears to be such a variety of views amongst\nphilosophers concerning the aim and character of explanation and\nprogress in cancer research. There is, of course, a long history of\ndebate among philosophers of biology concerning norms of\nexplanation. It’s still hotly debated whether, for instance, all\nexplanations in the biological sciences must identify causes, or\nmechanisms, or whether “mathematical” or\n“equilibrium” explanations are distinct in kind, and how\n“network” models or “systems theoretical”\nexplanations are distinct from other kinds of explanation, are all\nlive debates (See the entries on\n  scientific explanation and\n  philosophy of systems and synthetic biology). \nHowever,\nthere is also a history of dispute amongst cancer scientists about\nboth competing research agendas and explanatory strategies. \n\nAs mentioned above, for most of the last twenty or so years of the\n20th Century and the first decades of the 21st,\nthe central concern of the majority of cancer researchers seems to\nhave been identification of mechanisms at the cell and molecular level\nthat regulate cell birth and death. Two characteristic features of\ncancer cells are their uncontrolled growth, and failure to undergo\ncell death.  This is often accomplished via changes to the\n“cellular machinery,” or mutations and associated\ndisruption of pathways associated with regulation of cell division or\ncell death (Hanahan & Weinberg 2001). So, it is natural to assume\nthat explaining cancer requires identifying the chromosomal\nalterations, mutations, and epigenetic changes to cells that give them\ndistinctive capacities of a cancer cell, as well as describe the ways\nin which these mutations systematically yield these effects. This\nframework for explaining cancer has been characterized as\n“somatic mutation theory,” insofar as cancer is viewed as\na product of a series of mutations to cells during somatic cell\ndivision. Onset of cancer, on this view, may be accelerated either by\ninheritance of “oncogenes” or “tumor\nsuppressors,” or by damage to DNA, for instance, due to smoking\nor UV radiation. \n\nThis picture of cancer was pieced together over decades from various\nsources of evidence—from Virchow’s observations of\nchromosomal abnormalities in cancer cells, to epidemiological patterns\nof incidence in cancer, to the discovery of the “src”\ngene—one of the first mutations found to be associated with\ncancer.  This vision of cancer as the product of oncogenes replaced a\n“regulatory” view of cancer, according to which cancer was\na “breakdown in normal constraints on growth” (for a\nhistory, see, e.g., Morange 1993, 1997, 2003). Not coincidentally,\nthe “oncogene paradigm” arose at the same time that some\nof the first bioengineering technologies, which enabled early cancer\nresearchers to use the techniques of molecular biology to study\nidentify genes associated with cancer progression (Fujimura 1987).\nWhile this is a reductionist research program, in the sense that the\naim is to decompose the system of interest and understand the parts in\noperation, not all early advocates of the multistage theory were cell\nand molecular biologists. Two of the first advocates of a multi-stage\ntheory of carcinogenesis—Armitage and Doll—found that\ncurves of average lifetime incidence of lung cancer in smokers\nappeared to have the same shape as that of nonsmokers, simply shifted\nto earlier ages. This suggested that cancer could arise from a\nrate-limited series of insults acquired over the life course. Since\nthe 1980s, hundreds of genes have been identified, mutations to which\nare associated with the hallmarks of cancer. Carcinogenesis, on this\nview, results from damage to DNA, or errors in the process of cell\ndivision, as well as either endogenous factors (various hormonal or\nother factors that promote cell growth), or exogenous factors\n(infection, and inflammation), which over time can lead to\ndysregulated cell growth. \n\nIn one paradigmatic example, Vogelstein and his group collected\ntissue samples (premalignant polyps) from patients with a familial or\ninherited form of bowel cancer (FAP, or familial adenomatous\npolyposis). They discovered that mutations to genes associated with\nvarious cancers accumulated in series of steps, what has been called\nthe “Vogelstein cascade.” The study of familial or strongly\ninherited forms of cancer (cancers that appear at relatively young\nages, and occur in families) has enabled the identification of several\ngenes, mutations to which (whether inherited or acquired during somatic\ncell division) play a role in cancer: APC, RB, and p53 (associated with\nfamilial adenomatous polyposis, retinoblastoma, and Li Fraumeni\nsyndrome, respectively). \n\nThis picture of explaining cancer might be expected to resonate\nquite well with the picture of scientific explanation advocated by what\nhas been called the “new mechanists.” According to this\nview, one of the central aims of biological scientists is the\nidentification of mechanisms. The biological sciences, on this view,\nare unique in their focus on mechanisms, rather than laws or general\nprinciples, of the sort (typically imagined) to be central to the\nphysical sciences. A mechanistic explanation identifies parts and\nprocesses that typically yield specific outcomes of interest (Machamer,\net al. 2000). If we wish to understand regulation of apoptosis (cell\ndeath), for instance, we might identify particular genes and proteins\nthat play an important role in cell senescence, and determine how their\nactivity and organization yield (or fail to yield) a given outcome.\nThis mechanistic picture of the aims and character of explanation in\nthe biological sciences seems prima facie to characterize current\ncancer research quite well, or at least the past 25 years of this\nresearch. \n\nHowever, several philosophers have argued that this picture fails to\ncapture the diverse explanatory strategies carried out by cancer\nscientists, at least currently. For instance, some have argued that\nthis fails to take into consideration more “organicist” or\n“holistic” views of cancer causation, which they contrast\nwith a “reductionist” approach in cancer research\n(Bertolaso 2009). Some also argue that apparently competing\nperspectives can be fruitfully integrated (Bertolaso 2011; Marcum\n2005; Malaterre 2007). \n\nEven advocates of the mechanistic perspective have argued that it\nneeds to be amended to accommodate the complex causal processes\ninvolved in cancer’s etiology. For instance, according to Bechtel\n(forthcoming), a linear picture of mechanisms for cancer leaves out an\nimportant dimension. He characterizes the mechanisms associated with\napoptosis, for instance, as made up of two types: “primary”\nand “control” mechanisms. Failure to respond to signals\npromoting apoptosis in cancer may be a result of disruption in either\none (or both) such mechanisms. Advocates of the mechanistic perspective\nhave failed, Bechtel argues, to attend to the complex negative feedback\nprocesses of control and constraint affecting primary mechanisms. As\nevidence of the significance of such control mechanisms, he points out\nhow cancer researchers utilize novel methods, such as network analysis\nto identify regulatory networks or feedback loops, associated with\nspecific functions. Bechtel’s distinction between\n“primary” and “control” mechanism raises some\ninteresting questions about the organization of causal pathways in\ncancer. Whether such pathways are, for instance, relatively fixed or\nstatic in organization, is an open question. Moreover, the category of\n“controller” versus “primary” mechanism itself\nmay be relatively fluid, or context dependent. The “same”\nmechanism in a different environment might exert different controls,\nand, control mechanisms may themselves be viewed as primary, given\none’s characterization of the function that is the subject of\ninquiry.  \n\nSome critics of the somatic mutation theory and its associated search\nfor mechanisms of cancer at the cell and molecular level are far more\nradical in their ambitions. In the late 1990s, and early 2000s, two\nresearchers proposed what they took to be an alternative theory or\n“paradigm” to the “somatic mutation theory”\n(SMT), namely, the Tissue Organization Field Theory (or, TOFT) (Soto\n& Sonnenschein 2000). Soto and Sonnenschein object not only to\nreductionist methodology, but reductionist assumptions about the\ncauses of cancer. That is, their concern is not only with experimental\napproaches that focus on dysregulated growth of cancer cells in cell\nculture, but also with the claims regarding the role of mutations in\ncancer. In their view, cancers are not the result of mutations, but\ninstead “alterations in the communication among cells and\ntissues that affect tissue architecture” (2013, p. 90). On this\nview, mutations do not lead the way—or, directly affect these\nsignaling pathways—but follow upon disruptions to tissue\norganization. It is these alterations of patterns of interaction\nbetween cells that leads to “downward causation effects”\non cells and cellular components, inducing aneuploidy and mutations\n(Soto & Sonnenschein 2006; Sonnenschein & Soto 2008). Arguments\nsuch as this one raise several interesting philosophical\nquestions. First, Soto and Sonnenschein are skeptical of the\nscientific methodology supporting SMT. They bring attention to some\ninteresting broader questions as to when are we warranted in inferring\nfrom cell culture or model organism work to general claims about\ncancer etiology. \n\nGiven that the development of cancer is an immensely complex causal\nprocess that cannot be observed directly, many scientific claims about\ncancer’s causes are based on indirect inference, using model\norganisms or cells in culture. For instance, tumors are grown in nude\nmice using xenotransplantation, or, tumors are observed to grow in\nmice in which “driver genes” are “knocked\nout.” Soto and Sonnenschein have argued that the artificial\nexperimental circumstances that have enabled or promoted the study of\ncancer “genes” render judgments about their causal\nefficacy suspect; in principle, they claim, it’s consistent with\nthese experiments to suggest that these mutations are mere effects of\nthe true causes of carcinogenesis. Whether or not one agrees with\ntheir conclusions about TOFT v. SMT, they do raise methodological\nquestions worth exploring about the scope and limitations of model\norganism work. Germain (2013) points out that cancer in these\nxenotransplantation experiments are “highly artificial”\ncontexts, and echoes concerns of researchers that the use of\nimmunodeficient mice to study cancer stem cells, for instance, may or\nmay not warrant the conclusions they claim to\nestablish. Xenotransplantation, for instance, has been used to\narticulate and test hypotheses about “intrinsic\ntumorigenicity” of some cells, particularly cells expressing a\nparticular antigen, ABCB5+, which were then designated “cancer\nstem cells” in light of their capacity to form tumors in nude\nmice (Germain, 2013, p. 9). The problem with using these tools,\nhowever, is that the matter of when and whether a cell is\n“tumorigenic” varies across different backgrounds—in\nimmune deficient mice, lacking a particular receptor (interleukin-2\ngamma receptor, or Il2rg), tumors will grow, but not in mice with such\na receptor. Which experimental context is relevant to understanding\nhow and why cancer is caused by “stem cells,” thus depends\nupon which causes we wish to isolate, and how. As Germain points\nout, \n\nA second question that Soto and Sonnenschein's work raises is whether\n“downward causation” is at work in cancer. Several\nphilosophers have weighed in on this question (Malaterre 2011;\nBertolaso 2016; Green 2019).  Malaterre (2011) argues that advocates\nof TOFT need not commit to non-reductive physicalism, or emergent\nproperties. Instead, he argues, Soto and Sonnenschein are drawing\nattention to dynamic relationships between variables that supervene\nover molecular and cellular activities, and a “higher\nlevel,” or less granular explanation of cancer etiology may be\npreferred in some contexts, both for pragmatic and epistemic\nreasons. Malaterre makes appeal to Woodward’s (2010) argument\nthat choice of causal variables often involves appeal to something\nlike a notion of “proportionality,” such that, depending\non the target of inquiry, we may be “led to the incorporation of\nmore fine-grained detail in the specification of causes […] or\ntoward specifications that abstract away from such detail”\n(2010, 299). \n\nSoto and Sonnenschein would likely reject this analysis, insofar as\ntheir argument was not simply that tissue organization is deserving of\nour attention, for pragmatic reasons, but “that carcinogenesis\nresulted from the disruption of the reciprocal interactions between\nstroma and epithelium.” Or more precisely, “the cancer\nphenotype is an emergent phenomenon occurring at the tissue level of\norganization” (2006, p. 371). What evidence is offered up for this\nkind of causal relationship? There are three sources of evidence that\nSoto and Sonnenschein have emphasized as of relevance to their defense\nof “organicism” and TOFT: \n\nAll of these phenomena are taken as evidence that there are features\nof the tissue microenvironment that affect either the induction of or\nprogression of cancer, and such features are not reducible to, or\nexplainable in terms of properties or processes at or below the cell\nand molecular level. Further, Soto and Sonnenschein claim that the\nsomatic mutation theory cannot account for these observations, and that\nthey can only be accommodated on a view that takes that tissue\narchitecture itself as causally relevant to the progression of disease,\nwhich is described in this case as downward causation. \n\nDo such cases genuinely count as downward causation in, for\ninstance, Kim’s (1999) sense? After all, strictly speaking, the\nidea that causation is synchronic across the whole and part of the same\nentity seems contradictory. Soto and Sonnenschein accept this\ncriticism, and propose that the kind of causation they are invoking is\nnot synchronic, but “diachronic emergence”: \n“cellular and tissue events occurring before the expression of a\nparticular set of genes takes place may act downwardly modifying the\nexpression of these genes at a later time” (Soto, et al. 2008,\n271). \n\nThis, however, seems to be not as radical a metaphysical thesis as\ntalk of downward causation may initially suggest. Indeed, Soto and\nSonnenschein seem to simply refer to a form of constraint. Green\n(2019) takes “downward causation” to mean just this:\n“the role of solid-state tissue properties in tumor progression\ncan be interpreted as a form of downward causation, understood as\nconstraining relations between tissue-scale and micro-scale\nvariables” (p. 1). She notes that while this suggestion is\n“a ‘weaker’ form of downwards causation than the one\nKim (2000) and others oppose,” and so departs from standard use\nof the expression (at least among philosophers of mind), the advantage\nof this weaker notion that it better captures what scientists have in\nmind when arguing for the “necessity of higher-scale features\nfor the realization and understanding of biological phenomena.”\nSimilarly, Bertolaso (2016) argues that: \n\nShe characterizes this as an instance of synchronic reflexive\nemergence—“a different mode of causation. In such a mode,\neffects are not expressed in terms of a progression of events, but of\nmaintenance of states at different levels of biological\norganization” (Bertolaso 2016, p. 95). \n\nIt seems that each of these authors is pointing to an important role\nfor structural organization in the maintenance of homeostasis as\nplaying an important role in carcinogenesis. Indeed, evidence provided\nby Bissell’s lab (Weaver, et al. 1997, 2002) seems to indicate\nthat structural features of the extracellular matrix somehow either\nprevent the emergence of disease, or can accelerate it.  It seems such\nexamples do not point to “downward causation,” but instead\nsuggest that we need to expand our understanding of the causes of\ncancer to include maintenance of tissue integrity. That is, the case\nof cancer seems to require a richer, more integrative and\ninterdisciplinary approach to investigating cancer. \n\nAnother major research program that in some ways challenges a\nmechanistic picture of cancer (or at least some (Laplane, 2016) see as\nopposed to the “classical view” of cancer) is the\n“cancer stem cell” theory (CSC).  However, the idea of\ncancer stem cells has been somewhat controversial, in part due to the\nexperimental models used to establish and identify cancer stem\ncells. Fagan (2016) characterizes the notion of a cancer stem cell, as\nwell as the current state of the field, succinctly as follows. \n\nThe cancer stem cell theory in part is descended from the view that\ncancers are in several ways akin to ordinary tissue (though distorted),\ncontaining a mixture of proliferating stem cells and their more\ndifferentiated products. This view played an important role in cancer\nresearch in the 1960s and 1970s, and is sometimes called the \n“developmental” theory of cancer, in light of the fact that\nit takes cancer to be a disease of “development,” or\ncellular differentiation in particular (Pierce & Speers 1988, Morange\n2015, Laplane 2016). This model of cancer etiology was revived in the 90s,\nwhen Lapidot, Bonnet, and Dick identified “leukemic stem\ncells” (Lapidot, et al. 1994, Bonnet and Dick 1997), and was\nexpanded upon in the early 2000s with the identification of an\nanalogous cell population in breast cancer, suggesting that CSCs are a\ngeneral feature of all cancers (Al-Hajj, et al. 2003).  \n\nThe notion that there are subpopulations of cells within a tumor that\nplay a distinctive role—either in initiating a cancer, or in\nseeding new cancers, has been influential in current research,\nsuggesting new avenues for both treatment and prevention. Historically\nthe cancer stem cell theory (CSC) was framed in opposition to the\nsomatic mutation theory (e.g. Reya, et al. 2001; Wicha, et al. 2006;\nShipitsin, et al. 2007). Laplane (2016) has argued that the cancer stem\ncell theory (CSC) has various advantages over the alternative, which\nshe calls the “classical” theory. Laplane takes the\nfollowing to be the four fundamental theses of CSC theory: \n\nThe first two claims concern the concept of a stem cell; the latter\ntwo claims concern carcinogenesis itself: how cancer\narises. It’s the latter two theses that Laplane takes to be in\ntension with the “classical” theory. Laplane argues that\nCSC theory is more “parsimonious”, because it\n“explains cancer development, propagation and relapse”\nfrom a “limited number of hypotheses” (Laplane 2016,\n28). In contrast, the classical view neither predicts nor explains\ncancer heterogeneity, or relapse, but must invoke special\n(“additional” or “ad hoc” theories) to explain\nthem, in particular, evolutionary processes.  Moreover, the CSC theory\nhas the advantage that it “connects basic research and\nintervention by suggesting new therapeutic strategy” (Laplane\n2016, 28) \n\nFagan (2016) argues, to the contrary, that on a\n“model-based” approach, it’s not clear that these two\ntheories are inconsistent. Indeed, Laplane (2017) has more recently\npointed out how the CSC can serve to supplement the evolutionary\nperspective. The presence and number of cancer stem cells can, it has\nbeen suggested, affect the rate and nature of evolutionary change in a\npopulation of cancer cells. Essentially, if all cells in a tumor are\ndescended from one or a few cancer stem cells, this restricts\npopulation size, and thus suggests that to a large extent cancer\nprogression is driven by drift, rather than selection. Rather than see\nthe two theories as mutually exclusive, in other words, we might see\nthe two as complementary, in the process of integration, or overlapping\nmodels. \n\nAll this discussion of the role and nature of cancer stem cells,\nhowever, is complicated by the fact that there is a great deal of\ndispute around what counts as a cancer stem cell. Both Laplane and\nFagan draw attention to the fact that the concept of cancer stem\ncell is multiply ambiguous, in at least the following ways: \n\nWhat’s clear is that some populations of cells in a tumor appear\nto have “stemness” properties—the ability to renew\noneself. What is less clear is whether these capacities are context\nsensitive, and how and by which cells they may be acquired. The\nplasticity of many types of cancer cells suggests that they may\nacquire a stemness phenotype, and even shift back to non-stem\nphenotype. Given this, it appears that the CSC is just one of a\ncontinuum of general views, some of which take only specific types of\ncells to be precursors to cancer and others which grant that many\ndifferent types of cells have the potential to develop such\nproperties. That is, the real question at issue is whether the cells\nthat initiate a tumor are in some way distinctive or require\ndistinctive precursors, and how properties of stemness are\nacquired. Whether stemness is intrinsic or acquirable, niche-dependent\nor independent, moreover, will drastically change the therapeutic\nstrategy. The CSC model (the idea that CSC are at the origin of cancer\ndevelopment, resistance to treatment, and relapse) might be true and\nyet CSC-targeting strategy might fail. Indeed, what kind of property\n“stemness” is may vary across cancers, and even over time\nwithin a cancer (Laplane and Solary 2019). \n\nIn sum, there appear to remain several open questions about the\nnature of cancer stem cells, and more generally, how to best intervene upon\ncancer to successfully eradicate the disease. According to the model of\nthe disease inherited from the latter third of the 20th\nCentury, somatic mutations, acquired over a lifetime, to the\nacquisition of cancer’s “hallmarks.” So, the best\nstrategy for intervention may be targeting specific pathways associated\nwith these hallmarks. In contrast, according to the Tissue Organization\nField Theory (TOFT), changes in tissue organization yield\ncarcinogenesis. Thus, the best strategy for intervention might be\nfinding ways to intervene in the tissue microenvironment, so as to\ncreate an environment less hospitable to the growth of cancer cells.\nAccording to the cancer stem cell theory, cancer arises in cells that\nhave distinctive properties: continuous renewal, and indefinite growth,\npermitting the emergence of new disease. On this view, eradicating\nthese stem cells seems essential to cancer treatment. Philosophical\nwork on cancer causation and explanation can better illuminate the\ncompeting presuppositions of different approaches, clarify their\ncommitments, and offer insights into fruitful integration of new data.\nIt is already clear that philosophical discussions of ambiguities in\nhow we define and measure stemness is essential to understanding how\nbest to prevent recurrence and treat the disease (Clevers 2016). \n\nPhilosophical discussions of how and why TOFT and CSC challenge a\nsimple reductionist picture of cancer etiology are only two of several\nexamples. Other philosophers have described (or critiqued)\nevolutionary explanations of cancer (especially models of multilevel\nselection) (Germain 2012a; Lean and Plutynski 2016; Germain and\nLaplane 2017; Plutynski, 2018). Still others emphasize systems\nbiology-based approaches to cancer (Bertolaso 2016; Plutynski &\nBertolaso 2018), or the important role of a developmental perspective\n(Laplane 2016, 2018; Fagan 2017). Others still emphasize how one might\nmodel cancer as an infectious disease (Liu, et al. 2017), and or an\nevolutionary-developmental process (Liu 2018). What all these\nphilosophers seem to emphasize is that the study of mechanisms\nassociated with cancer at the cell and molecular level requires\nsupplementation to better predict and explain the origin of the\ndisease, and design effective therapies. In addition, Pradeu\n(forthcoming) has recently pointed out how the immune system plays an\napparently “paradoxical” dual role in cancer, both acting\nto prevent and promote cancer. This raises interesting questions about\nthe function of the immune system, as well as the appropriate way of\nunderstanding “organism,” “self” and\n“non-self” in biological contexts. There remain\ninteresting questions about how to integrate various perspectives on\nthis complex disease. \n\nDobzhansky (1973) wrote that “nothing in biology makes sense\nexcept in light of evolution.” Can evolutionary thinking shed\nlight on cancer? After all, cancer is ordinarily understood to be a\ncase of failure of otherwise functional controls on cell birth and\ndeath. At first pass, this view seems fundamentally at odds with\ntaking an evolutionary perspective on cancer. For, how can something\nthat is an exemplary case of “dysfunction” count as an\nevolutionary process or product of adaptive evolution? Moreover, how\nought we to square this picture of cancer with the fact that cancer\ncells seem to co-opt developmental processes—i.e., the process\nof “de-differentiation” typical of early embryonic cells?\nIs cancer a byproduct of development? Finally, cancer seems to\nincrease in incidence as we age. Is cancer simply a byproduct of\naging?  Relatedly, if—as some argue—aging itself is\nselected for (a contested question!), is cancer in some sense\n“adaptive”? All these perspectives on cancer require us to\nperhaps rethink the nature of function and dysfunction, or at least\nbetter understand how there are trade-offs in fitness at different\ntemporal and spatial scales over the course of our life and\nevolutionary history. The best perspective to take on this may be a\n“multilevel” evolutionary perspective—i.e.,\nthinking of evolution by natural selection as operating at different\ntemporal and spatial scales, both sequentially, and in some cases,\nsimultaneously, sometimes yielding unfortunate “cross-level\nbyproducts” of selection at one temporal and spatial scale, for\nentities or processes at other temporal or spatial scales (cf. Okasha\n2007). \n\nFirst, it is relatively uncontroversial that understanding a\nspecies’ evolutionary history, and the selective trade-offs they\nface over the course of their life history, can inform our\nunderstanding of how and why they are more or less vulnerable to\ndisease. For instance, some species are more vulnerable to cancer than\nothers. Why? Comparative biology—the comparison of different\nspecies—may help us identify mechanisms associated with disease\nvulnerability, onset and progression, when they arose, where and why\nthey are shared, as well as how they have diverged (Aktipis, et al.\n2015). Comparing and contrasting how development, immunity, and other\nmechanisms of suppression of cancer across species can help cancer\nresearchers identify targets of opportunity for either treatment or\nprevention of cancer. In addition, we can look to unique features of\nour own evolutionary history in order to explain patterns of disease\nincidence, suggesting selective “mismatches” with our\nancestral environment, a kind of “byproduct” explanations\nof our vulnerability to diseases. This enterprise is broadly\ncharacterized as “evolutionary medicine” (Crespi, et\nal. 2005; Gluckman, et al. 2009; Stearns & Koella 2008; Sun, et\nal. 2014). \n\nWhile the broad principles behind evolutionary medicine are\nrelatively uncontroversial—we all are evolved organisms after\nall—philosophers of biology have been skeptical of particular\nclaims about how our evolutionary history has shaped our vulnerability\nto disease. Some such claims have been particularly contentious, either\nbecause the nature of the disease itself is not well characterized\n(especially mental illness, for instance), or evidence in support of\nevolutionary “mismatch” with our ancestral environment is\nboth scant and disputed. Particularly where alternative explanations\nmay well involve attributing responsibility to, e.g., pollutants, or\nchoices in lifestyle that are politically or socially sensitive,\nphilosophers of science have been particularly skeptical. Some have\nargued that many arguments in evolutionary medicine make\n“adaptationist” assumptions, i.e., assumptions that a given\ntrait is adaptive, or selectively advantageous, founded on at best\n“just so” stories (Valles 2011; see also Murphy 2006). \n\nOf course, there are better and worse such arguments; the best\narguments consider not only the widest array of evidence, but also\ntrade offs in fitness, as well as the role of constraints arising out\nof development and life history. For instance, traits adaptive early in\nlife may yield fitness costs later in life. A vivid example of a\ntrade-off in fitness is androgenic hormones; such hormones predispose\nmen to higher prostate cancer risk, but they may also yield an\nadvantage early in life, in terms of increasing sperm production,\nrelative growth and size at sexual maturity, and thus (potentially)\naccess to mates and resources. Some defenders of evolutionary\nperspectives on medicine claim that high prostate cancer risk in taller\nmen may thus be a case of a “mismatch” between our\nancestral and current contexts (see, e.g., Summers, et al. 2008 for\ndiscussion). Presumably, philosophers are likely to contest such\narguments on a variety of grounds—either speculative\nassumptions about the adaptive advantage of size or early age of sexual\nmaturity in our evolutionary past, or concerns about how or how much\nvariability in hormones contributes either to body size or cancer risk.\nThough, this provides an interesting case study for considering how\nhypotheses about the role of sex and age in disease risk are tested, an\narea of growing interest. \n\n“Mismatch” hypotheses suggest that traits that may have\nbeen adaptive in the past leave us vulnerable to disease in our current\nenvironment. For instance, many advocates of evolutionary medicine have\nargued that the high correlation between nulliparity and cancer risk\nmight be explained by our evolutionary history. The argument is that\nwomen in the evolutionary past were pregnant for much of their lives,\nstarting at an earlier age; breast development and differentiation was\nthus adapted to a lifetime of frequent pregnancy and nursing. Delaying\nor avoiding pregnancy changes the developmental processes typical for\nour species, and might expose women to more cycles of estrogen, which\ncould increase breast cancer risk. Of course, such hypotheses are\ncontentious; there is always the potential for confounding causes (in\nthis case, of increased cancer risk due to a variety of risk factors at\nwork in modern society) (Greaves 2000). Nonetheless, it has been\nknown for centuries that nulliparity (not having children) raises\nbreast cancer risk, and since at least the 1970s, it’s been\nwidely known (at least in the cancer research community) that the more\nchildren one has, starting at a younger age, the lower the risk of\nbreast cancer. In a 1970 case-control study conducted at eight\ndifferent locations around the globe, a WHO group led by McMahon et\nal., estimated that “breast cancer risk for women having their\nfirst birth under the age of 20 years is about half that for\nnulliparous women,” and that “women having their first\nchild when aged under 18 years have only about one-third the breast\ncancer risk of those whose first birth is delayed until the age of 35\nyears or more.” Evolutionary “byproduct” explanations\nappeal to our evolutionary history to explain this observation. \n\nAnother type of “byproduct” explanation of\ncancer—though one that appeals to a much more distant event in\nour evolutionary history—is that cancer is a product of the\nemergence of multicellularity. At one point in the very distant past,\nsingle celled organisms formed collectives that cooperate; these\ncollectives eventually became multicellular organisms. Any collective\nof cells, especially collectives whose survival and reproductive\nsuccess depends on functional organization, are potentially vulnerable\nto breakdown in cooperative organization. On this view, then, cancer\nis a product of breakdown in mechanisms that permitted the emergence\nof multicellularity—the mechanisms that protect us from\n“revolt from within” are not error-free, and over time\nwill fail. According to Greaves and others (Greaves, et al. 2012;\nMerlo, et al. 2006) the evolutionary picture of cancer dovetails\nnicely with the somatic mutation theory; somatic cells divide and\nacquire mutations during our lifetimes; some of these mutations\ninvolve failures in regulatory pathways that ordinarily\n“enforce” functional organization, and thus\ncooperation. In this way, an evolutionary\nperspective—understanding how evolution of multicellularity\nrequired the emergence of cooperative organization—is essential\nto understanding cancer. Moreover, on this view, cancer itself may be\nviewed as an evolutionary process—the emergence of adaptive\nfeatures of cancer cells, where these “adaptations” enable\nshort term “fitness,” or relative success at survival and\nreproduction. Several scientists have developed theoretical models of\nthis process, linking it to empirical data, e.g., on the emergence of\nchemotherapy resistance (Frank 2007; Wodarz & Komarova 2015). \n\nOn this view, cancer is a both a process and byproduct of\nmulti-level selection, where selection may be understood as operating\nat several levels of biological organization simultaneously, or\nsequentially (Damuth, et al. 1988; Lean, et al. 2016). That is,\ncancer cells may bear adaptations, and, they are also evolutionary\nbyproducts of selective processes at other level of organization. It\nappears that cancer cells co-opt or hijack otherwise adaptive features\nof organisms. Signaling pathways that are ordinarily in service of\nadaptive functions in early stages of development or wound healing are\nreactivated in (some) cancer cells, in service of the transition to\nmetastasis. This is a classic example of a cross-level selective\nbyproduct (Okasha 2005, 2006). Traits advantageous at one level in the\norganization of multicellular organisms may be coopted by component\nparts. Some of the capacities that invasive cancer cells acquire (the\ncapacity to invade and metastasize) are in fact due to a change in\nphenotype from epithelial to mesenchymal type cells, and losing\nadhesive properties enables such cells to invade the lymph and blood\nsystem. Lean and Plutynski (2016) have argued that cancer may in some\nways parallel the patterns of emergence of multicellularity as\ncharacterized by Damuth and Heisler (1988), shifting over the course of\nemergence of disease from a simple selective process between individual\ncells to several kinds of multilevel selective process (MLS1 to MLS2).\nCritics contest that the process of metastasis only weakly mimics MLS2,\nhowever (Germain, et al. 2017). \n\nTo be sure, there are both analogies and disanalogies between\nevolution in whole organisms, and the evolving population of cancer\ncells in a tumor (Germain 2012). However, thinking of cancer as a\ndynamic, evolutionary process, has great potential for applications in\ncancer treatment, and perhaps also, in prevention. For instance, some\nhave suggested that we might give young girls drugs or nutritional\nsupplements that remodel the breast in ways akin to pregnancy, as a way\nto prevent the emergence of breast cancer (Katz, et al. 2015). Others\nsuggest that modeling the evolution of multi-drug resistance may help\nprevent one of the major causes of cancer mortality. Drugs can be more\nor less effective in different patients, and lose their effectiveness\nover time. An evolutionary perspective on cancer may shed light on how\ndrug resistance comes about, in patients with more or less intratumor\nheterogeneity (Greaves 2000, 2007; Frank & Nowak 2004; Merlo, et\nal. 2006; Greaves and Maley, 2010).  \n\nA third type of byproduct explanation for cancer is the view that\ncancer is a disease of aging—that is, cancer incidence by and\nlarge increases as we age, perhaps in part as a byproduct of\nbreakdowns in mechanisms associated with immune response and tissue\nintegrity.  This claim raises some broader questions about how we\nassess function and dysfunction, or how we assess function at\ndifferent temporal and spatial scales of analysis, as well as how we\nunderstand the role of the immune system and the integrity of the\norganism as an individual.  Indeed, all evolutionary and byproduct\nexplanations of cancer raise similar philosophical questions about\nhypothesis testing, as well as definitions of “function”\nand “individuality,” both at the individual and group\nlevel, and over the course of one’s life history. On the\nevolutionary view of cancer, for instance, cancer cells are in some\nsense highly adaptive (Hausman 2011; Germain 2012; Godfrey-Smith\n2009). One relatively controversial view of aging, first proposed by\nAugust Weisman, is that aging has the evolutionary\nadvantage—effectively clearing the way for the young. If indeed\ncancer is a necessary byproduct of aging, and aging is selected for,\nthen on one view, cancer may be thought of as adaptive.  Such a view\nraises a variety of questions about evidence and adaptationist\nexplanations (see SEP entry on “Adaptation”).  They also\nraise questions about the merits of group versus individual level\nselection hypotheses. Moreover, the dual role of the immune system in\nboth preventing—and paradoxically, in some cases, promoting\ncancer—raises interesting questions about the nature of\nbiological individuality, as well as how we define\n“immunity” an the role of the immune system in setting out\nthe boundaries of the organism. (For a vivid discussion, see, e.g.,\n(Okasha 2006; Godfrey-Smith 2009; Bouchard & Huneman 2013; Clarke\n2011, 2013; Love & Brigandt 2017; Bueno, et al. 2019; Pradeu 2012,\n2013, 2016, 2019). \n\nThere are several ways in which biomedical and public health\nresearch on cancer intersects with debates about the proper role of\nvalues in science. First, epidemiological and toxicological research is\nused in support of regulatory policy and toxic tort law. Decisions\nabout when and what is “carcinogenic” have significant\npublic health import, and thus raise a variety of philosophical\nquestions about evidence, values risk, and precaution (Mayo, et al.\n1994; Cranor 1993, 2006, 2011, 2018). \n\nEvidence for such claims is often indirect, and underdetermination is\nrife. In tests of carcinogenicity, there is a choice of levels of\nsignificance, and even optimally done epidemiological studies, or\ntoxicological studies, for instance, at best lend high probability to\nclaims about health risk. In such contexts, there is “inductive\nrisk”, or the risk of error either in over- or under-estimation\nof actual risk of cancer, and thus, room for values to play a role.\nSeveral philosophers of science have weighed in on this matter of when\nand whether values ought to play a role in such contexts, as well as\nwhich values, in particular precautionary judgments that may have\nimport for policy or law (see, e.g., Mayo 1988; Douglas 2000, 2009;\nBrown 2013; Steel 2007, 2010, 2015; Elliott 2011; Shrader-Frechette\n1993, 1994, 2002, 2004; and Mitchell 2009). As one might imagine,\nthere is also a substantive history of debate among epidemiologists,\npublic health scientists, scholars of the law, around when we have\ngood reason to claim that X or Y is carcinogenic, or what counts as\ngood or “good enough” evidence, going back to the dispute\nbetween Doll and Hill and their detractors, regarding the causal link\nbetween smoking and lung cancer (Hill, 1965). For a compelling history\nof this literature, see, e.g., Proctor (1995), or more recently,\nOreskes, et al. (2011). Problems of underdetermination are no less\nrife in the context of assessments of “effectiveness” of\ncancer screening and prevention (see, e.g., Solomon 2015; Stegenga\n2017; Plutynski 2017. (For a discussion, see the entry on\n  philosophy of medicine.) \n\nSecond, much of basic cancer research—e.g., research on the\ncell and molecular bases of the disease—is supported by federal\nfunds, which often are allocated in the hopes that such research will\n(eventually) yield better health outcomes. Yet, the relationship\nbetween “bench and bedside” is, by all accounts, extremely\nindirect, and shaped by many factors outside of the merits of the\nscience itself. So, it’s unclear whether and how\n“basic” cancer science ought to be evaluated in light of\nwhether or how it leads to better health outcomes. However, this is\nhard to avoid, particularly when so many lives depend upon a research\nprogram’s promised outcomes. \n\nThis whole matter is complicated by the fact that the study of cancer\nis itself big business. Indeed, some compare cancer research and\nmedicine to a “medical industrial complex.” Cancer\npharmaceuticals, medical devices, and cancer research more generally,\nare major drivers of the economy. On the one hand, given the loss of\nlife due to cancer, one could argue that the time and energy devoted\nto cancer care and research is proportional to the threat. Löwy\n(1996) in her Between Bench and Bedside characterizes this as\nthe “white” (optimistic) reading of the situation.\nArguably, however, many other diseases, often those more prevalent in\n“developing” parts of the world, cause far more extensive\nloss of life. As Reiss and Kitcher (2009) and Reiss (2009) have\nargued, from a “Millian” perspective, we ought to be\nexpending our resources on those diseases that proportionally cause\nthe greatest loss of life, and so, at least from a strictly maximizing\nutilitarian perspective, these diseases have a greater claim on our\ninvestments.  The vast funds invested in cancer research—at\nleast during the past 25 years or so—have done very little to\nshift mortality rates. This leads to what Löwy might call the\npessimistic answer to this question. According to one line of\nthinking, the centrality of cancer in biomedical research is a product\nof several historical, economic, institutional, and social forces in\ncombination, some of which are self-perpetuating (Proctor 1995;\nFujimura 1996; Clarke & Fujimura 2014). Ever since Nixon’s\n1971 call for a “war” on cancer, advertised implications\nfor cancer treatment or prevention have been used to bolster much of\nbasic research into genetics, genomics, and cell and molecular\nbiology, fostering investment in biotechnology. Some have argued that\nthis has led to an unduly excessive, or disproportionate fear of\ncancer as a disease, an excess of anxiety, and perhaps also\nunnecessary or unwarranted use of medical screening and testing\n(Aronowitz 2007, 2009, 2015). \n\nOn the other hand, cancer research has led to important innovations\nin science and medicine with impacts much wider than cancer itself.\nMoreover, particularly in the U.S., regulations on research by, e.g.,\nthe FDA on the design and conduct of clinical trials for approval of\ndrugs, for instance, may in part be slowing research and leading to\nexcessive costs. Some argue that we ought to lift restrictions on such\ntests for novel and more “precise” (or targeted) drugs that\nmight benefit very few. Such matters are of course intertwined with\nlarger debates among both clinician-researchers and philosophers of\nmedicine around when and whether we have sufficient evidence to claim\nthat, e.g., this or that mode of intervention is effective. In part,\nsuch debates are shaped by the economic costs of large clinical trials,\nand in part, by epistemic issues around what and how we can and should\nmeasure, in making claims to “effective” intervention\n(Ashcroft 2002; Cartwright 2011; Howick 2011; Stegenga 2015; Teira\n2011; Teira, et al. 2015; González-Moreno, et al. 2015;\nDeaton, et al. 2018). \n\nOne area where such questions are particularly fraught is\n“precision” medicine; Obama’s Reinvestment act\nbudgeted a significant component toward cancer genomics, with the idea\nthat a more fine grained analysis of the molecular and genomic\nfeatures of cancer would promote more effective prediction and control\nof cancer risk, enable detection of cancers at much earlier stages,\nand less debilitating, more targeted treatments. With better\ntechnologies and more fine-tuned risk information, the practice of\nmedicine has been shifting from diagnosis (and treatment) of disease,\nto constant surveillance and intervention on disease risk, as well as\nhigher rates of overdiagnosis and overtreatment (diagnosis and\ntreatment for a proto-disease state that may never have progressed in\nthe lifetime of a patient) (Welch, et al. 2011; Esserman, et al.\n2014). Moreover, one concern some have raised about precision oncology\nis that it has been less successful than hoped or advertised (Prasad\n& Gale 2016, Prasad, et al. 2016).  Such skepticism should raise\ngenuine concerns—especially given the hopes of patients and\nfamilies hanging upon the promises of such treatments, and the overall\ncosts of both cancer care, and precision medicine research. In sum,\ncurrent practices of cancer research, screening and treatment raise a\nnumber of questions: How ought we to allocate research funds in cancer\nresearch? How is investment in precision medicine likely to yield the\nbenefits promised? When is medical intervention on disease risk\n(rather than disease itself) unduly excessive? What exactly does it\nmean to speak of effective medical intervention? Is overdiagnosis and\novertreatment a serious harm, or is it simply an inevitable byproduct\nof an otherwise effective strategy—treating disease risk? How\nought clinicians to communicate about risk and benefit of novel\ntargeted interventions to patients, especially where there are gray\nareas of benefit and harm?  Are the (frequently) excessive costs of,\nand inequitable access to, cancer care, matters of justice? \n\nCancer research—and especially the hope and hype surrounding\nprecision medicine—provides a focused lens through which to\nconsider problems central to critical examination of the concepts and\nmethods of the biomedical sciences. That is, cancer and the scientific\nstudy of cancer illustrate challenges facing disease classification,\nfuzzy borders between disease versus health, the problems with genetic\nessentialism, the ever-present reference class problem and ever\npromised solutions, as well as specific ways in which\nunderdetermination of evidence in biomedicine shapes matters of\njustice in public health. Moreover, it provides a case study in how\nmatters of evidence, disease status, and questions of values and\njustice are deeply intertwined.","contact.mail":"aplutyns@wustl.edu","contact.domain":"wustl.edu"}]
