Let us say that one has\ninferential or nonfoundational knowledge that p when\none’s knowledge that p depends on one’s knowledge\nof some other proposition(s) from which one can legitimately infer\np; and one has foundational or noninferential knowledge that\np when one’s knowledge that p does not depend\non any other knowledge one has in this way. According to\nfoundationalism regarding knowledge, we have some foundational\nknowledge, and any nonfoundational or inferential knowledge that we\nhave depends, ultimately, on this foundational knowledge. What\ndistinguishes classical foundationalism (or at least a prominent\nversion of classical foundationalism) about knowledge is the\ninsistence that all foundational knowledge is knowledge by\nacquaintance. \n\n\nHistorically, the distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and\nknowledge by description is made between two kinds of\nknowledge. However, after a brief discussion of\nRussell’s presentation of the distinction, we follow the\ncontemporary literature in focusing more on the role of acquaintance\nin securing justified or rational belief. (See the\nentry on\n epistemology\n for more on the relation between knowledge and justification.) This\nis important both because doing so can illuminate the role that\nacquaintance plays in securing knowledge (which arguably requires\njustified belief) and because we may be interested in its role as a\nsource of justification even when we fall short of knowledge. Let us\nsay that one has an inferentially justified belief that p\nwhen one’s belief that p depends for its justification\non justified belief in some other proposition(s) from which one can\nlegitimately infer p; and one has a foundationally or\nnoninferentially justified belief that p when one’s\nbelief that p is justified but does not depend on any other\nbeliefs for its justification. According to foundationalism regarding\njustification, we have some foundationally justified beliefs, and all\nother justified beliefs must depend for their justification on\nfoundationally justified beliefs. Classical versions of\nfoundationalism about justification hold that foundational beliefs are\njustified by acquaintance. (See the entry on\n foundationalist theories of epistemic justification\n for more on foundationalism.) As we shall see, proponents of\nclassical foundationalism typically ascribe other important\nphilosophical roles to acquaintance.\n\nTo get clear on the distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and\nknowledge by description, let us briefly examine how its originator,\nBertrand Russell, characterized it (see Russell 1910–11 and\n1912: Ch. 5). First, what is meant by “acquaintance” and\n“description”?  \nWe shall say that we have acquaintance with anything of which\nwe are directly aware, without the intermediary of any process of\ninference or any knowledge of truths. (Russell 1912: 78) \nI say that I am acquainted with an object when I have a\ndirect cognitive relation to that object, i.e., when I am directly\naware of the object itself. When I speak of a cognitive relation here,\nI do not mean the sort of relation which constitutes judgment, but the\nsort which constitutes presentation. In fact, I think the relation of\nsubject and object which I call acquaintance is simply the converse of\nthe relation of object and subject which constitutes presentation.\nThat is, to say that S has acquaintance with O is\nessentially the same thing as to say that O is presented to\nS. (Russell 1910/11: 108) \nRussell thus characterizes acquaintance as a relation of direct\nawareness, a relation in which, as Russell and some others have\nput it, something is “presented” or simply\n“given” to the subject (see e.g., Lewis 1929 and 1946;\nMoser 1989: 80ff.; Fales 1996.) Various positions can accept some sort\nof distinction between direct and indirect “awareness”:\nroughly, an awareness of X is indirect if it depends on\nawareness of something else, and direct otherwise. But this\ncharacterization of the distinction leaves open what counts as direct\nawareness.  \nWhat distinguishes acquaintance is, minimally, the following two\nclosely related features. First, it is a nonjudgmental and\nnonconceptual form of awareness. Judgments, thoughts and concepts are\nessentially intentional or representational in nature, i.e.,\nthey are about or represent other things.\nAcquaintance with something does not consist in forming any judgment\nor thought about it, or in having any concept or representation of it.\n(In the second passage above Russell does characterize it as a special\n“cognitive” relation, but one must immediately wonder what\nthis means given that he explicitly denies that it is judgmental in\nnature.) Second, it is a form of awareness constituting a real,\ngenuine relation, a relation that cannot obtain without its\nrelata (the things or items related). One cannot be\nacquainted with something that does not exist. Acquaintance is thus\nlike the relation of kicking or throwing, for one cannot kick or throw\nwithout there being something that is kicked or thrown—something\nthat is the object of the kicking or throwing. (Of course, these are\nnot forms of awareness!) In contrast, judgments and concepts\nmay represent or be about things that don’t exist. Philosophers\nsometimes refer to this second feature by saying that acquaintance is\n“infallible”. However, this term is most often used to\nrefer to a property of beliefs: roughly, a belief is\ninfallible if it is immune to error or is guaranteed to be true. Given\nthe first feature above, being acquainted with something is not to be\nunderstood in terms of having a belief or judgment about it, not even\nan infallible one. \nBy a “description” Russell means any phrase of the form\n“a so-and-so” (an “ambiguous” or\n“indefinite” description) or “the so-and-so”\n(a “definite” description), though he focuses on the\nlatter in his discussion of knowledge by description. Russell’s\ndefinition of knowledge by description builds naturally on this: To\nknow some thing or object by a definite description is to know that it\nis the so-and-so or that the so-and-so exists, i.e., that there is\nexactly one object that is so-and-so (Russell 1912: 82–3). On\nRussell’s view, proper nouns, and most common words, are really\ndisguised descriptions (1912: 84–5). We might claim to know who\nJack the Ripper was, that he was a vicious human being, and so on, but\nwe can only think of and know the individual about whom the claim is\nmade through a description of that individual—Jack the Ripper is\nthat person (whoever he was) who committed certain atrocities in\nLondon in 1888. We have no “first hand” knowledge of the\nperson about whom our judgment is made—we don’t even have\n“first hand” knowledge that only one individual committed\nthe murders or, for that matter, that the murders took place. Put\nanother way, we are not directly acquainted with either the crimes or\nthe perpetrator of those crimes since he is long dead and we have\nsurely never met him. \nTalk of descriptions naturally suggests the use of language,\nand as we have just seen, Russell himself often characterizes\ndescriptions in linguistic terms, e.g., as phrases having\nsuch-and-such a form. However, for Russell, description does not\nessentially involve the use of words or phrases of a language; it\ninvolves the use or application of concepts. To know\nsomething “by description” does not require the use of\nlanguage or linguistic terms, but it does require the use or\napplication of concepts. \nThe example of Jack the Ripper just given, and many of Russell’s\nexamples, are at best misleading. They trade on that commonplace\ndistinction between things we know “first hand” and things\nwe have only heard about or read about—the things that have been\ndescribed to us. \nBut our commonsense way of making the distinction soon goes by the\nwayside. Most philosophers wedded to some notion of acquaintance end\nup rejecting the idea that we have acquaintance even with bread-box\nsized objects, immediately before us, under ideal conditions of\nperception. The test to determine with what we are acquainted is often\nreminiscent of the method Descartes recommended for finding secure\nfoundations of knowledge—the method of doubt (see Russell 1912:\n74; Price 1932: 3). If you are considering whether you are acquainted\nwith something, ask yourself whether you can conceive of being in this\nvery state when the putative object does not exist. If you can, you\nshould reject the suggestion that you are directly acquainted with the\nitem in question. Based on possibilities of error about physical\nobjects from illusion, hallucination and dreams, it seemed to most\nthat we could rule out acquaintance with physical objects, future\nevents, other minds, and facts that involve any of these as\nconstituents. Consider, for example, physical objects. It seems that\nthe evidence that my experiences give me right now for supposing that\nthere is a computer before me is perfectly consistent with the\nhypothesis that I am now having a vivid dream or a vivid\nhallucination. If this is right, then the experiential evidence I\npossess cannot be the computer or any of its constituents. Neither the\ncomputer, nor any of its constituents, need be present in that vivid\ndream or hallucination. Even when our evidence for the presence of\nphysical objects seems as good as we can get, then, we are not\nacquainted with physical objects or their constituents. (However, some\nhave recently defended the view that we can be acquainted with\nphysical objects in perception. See, for example, Johnston 2004.)\nTraditionally, acquaintance theorists have taken the most promising\ncandidates for entities with which we can be acquainted to be\nconscious states of mind (e.g., an experience of pain, a sensation of\nred) and their properties (e.g., painfulness, redness). Russell and\nmany other acquaintance theorists also take themselves to be\nacquainted with facts, i.e., with something’s having\nsome property—at least mental facts (e.g., my being in pain, my\ndesiring food, my experiencing red).  \nWhat about the possibility of acquaintance with ourselves? Can an\nindividual be directly acquainted with him or herself? Russell takes\nthe question of whether we are ever acquainted with the self to be a\ndifficult one. He says that acquaintance with the self is “hard\nto disentangle from other things,” but tentatively concludes\nthat “it is probable, though not certain, that we have\nacquaintance with Self” (1912: 78–81.) However, he later\ndenies that we have acquaintance with the self (see Russell 1914: part\nIII). In a recent paper, Duncan (2015) uses the method of doubt, or\nsomething very much like it, to argue that we are acquainted with\nourselves. \nLet us now return to the primary question of this section: how should\nwe understand the distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and\nknowledge by description? When philosophers speak of\nknowledge they typically mean to be discussing knowledge of\ntruths or propositional knowledge, knowledge that involves a belief or\njudgment in some true claim or proposition. As introduced by Russell,\nthe distinction sometimes seems to be that between noninferential or\nfoundational knowledge on the one hand, and inferential or\nnonfoundational knowledge on the other. Roughly, one has\nnonfoundational or inferential knowledge that p when\none’s knowledge that p depends on one’s knowledge\nof some other proposition(s) from which one can legitimately infer\np; and one has foundational or noninfrential knowledge that\np when one’s knowledge that p does not depend\non any other knowledge one has. Knowledge by acquaintance is\nfoundational knowledge because it depends on one’s acquaintance\nwith the object itself, or with properties of or facts about the\nobject, and not on any further knowledge of truths. Knowledge by\ndescription, in contrast, always depends on some further knowledge of\ntruths for support; as Russell puts it, knowledge by description\n“always involves…some knowledge of truths as its\nsource and ground” (1912: 72–3, emphasis added). \nThis seems to be a natural and relatively straightforward way of\ndrawing the distinction. However, there may seem to be a problem with\nthis way of drawing the distinction, at least as an interpretation of\nRussell, for he denies that knowledge by acquaintance is knowledge of\ntruths: \nKnowledge of things, when it is of the kind we call knowledge by\nacquaintance, is essentially simpler than any knowledge of\ntruths, and logically independent of knowledge of truths, though it\nwould be rash to assume that human beings ever, in fact, have\nacquaintance with things without at the same time knowing some truth\nabout them. (Russell 1912: 72) \nWe have already seen that for Russell acquaintance is nonjudgmental or\nnonpropositional; to be acquainted with something is to be aware\nof it in a way that does not essentially involve being aware\nthat it is so-and-so. Russell seems to be extending this to\nknowledge by acquaintance: it is knowledge of something, and\nlogically independent of knowledge that something is\nso-and-so. Nor is this usage of the term ‘knowledge’ and\nits cognates strange: we do indeed talk about knowing people and\ncities. This might suggest that we should draw the distinction between\nknowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description not as one\nbetween foundational and nonfoundational knowledge of truths, but as\none between knowledge of truths and knowledge of something other than\ntruths. Indeed, as we have seen, Russell at one point defines\nknowledge of something by description simply as knowledge that it is\nso-and-so, not foundational knowledge that it is so-and-so\n(1912: 84–5). But then, what more than acquaintance is\ninvolved in knowledge by acquaintance? It is difficult to\nfind an answer from Russell. \nIt is tempting to suppose that Russell equivocates between the\nrelation of acquaintance and the special kind of knowledge of truth\n(foundational knowledge) whose sole source is acquaintance. That we\nordinarily talk about knowing things and people might encourage this\nequivocation. Moreover, perhaps the fact that acquaintance is a form\nof awareness of the most direct, most secure kind, and is fundamental\nto all knowledge of truths, led Russell to think it deserves to be\ncalled “knowledge” of the thing in question. The issue\nhere is largely terminological. In order to guard against confusing\nacquaintance on the one hand with foundational knowledge\nof truths acquired by acquaintance on the other, and facilitate\nan examination of the relation between them, we should be more careful\nthan Russell and restrict knowledge by acquaintance\nto foundational knowledge of truths. By contrast, one can\nhave acquaintance with items that are not truths, items that\ncannot be said to be true or false. Knowledge by description, on the\nother hand, is nonfoundational knowledge of truths; it “always\ninvolves…some knowledge of truths as its source and\nground” (Russell 1912: 72–3). We adopt this usage in what\nfollows.  \nFor classical foundationalists like Russell, all knowledge of truths\nultimately depends on foundational knowledge of truths acquired by\nacquaintance. But how exactly does acquaintance contribute to this\nknowledge of truths? If acquaintance is nothing like a judgment or\nbelief, and if the items with which we are acquainted are themselves\nneither true nor false, how do we get any knowledge of truths\nout of acquaintance? We turn to this question in\n section 3. \nFirst, however, let us briefly discuss contemporary views regarding\nthe nature and objects of acquaintance. \nWe said above that what distinguishes the classical, Russellian notion\nof acquaintance is, minimally, that (i) it is a non-intentional form\nof awareness: acquaintance with something does not consist in forming\nany judgment or thought about it, or applying any concepts to it; and\n(ii) it is real relation requiring the existence of its\nrelata; one cannot be acquainted with some thing, property or\nfact that does not exist. Let us use the label “acquaintance\ntheory” broadly to stand for any view, in the philosophy of mind\nor epistemology, in which acquaintance so understood plays a central\nrole. There has been a resurgence of interest in acquaintance theory\nin the last 25 years or so. Contemporary proponents include BonJour\n(2001, 2003), Chalmers (2010), Fales (1996), Fumerton (1995, 2001,\n2016), Gertler (2001, 2011, 2012), Hasan (2011, 2013), McGrew (1995,\n1999), Moser (1989), Stoutenburg (forthcoming), and Taylor (2013). As\nwe shall see, some of these philosophers depart from Russell in\nsignificant ways. However, like him, they are all committed to the\nexistence and philosophical significance of a direct, nonjudgmental\nform of awareness (indeed, many of them call it\n“acquaintance”) and this warrants treating them all as\n“acquaintance theorists.” Most of them also explicitly\nendorse classical foundationalism: like Russell, they hold that all\nknowledge or justified belief ultimately depends on a foundation of\nknowledge or justified belief acquired by acquaintance. There are\nconsistent ways to accept acquaintance theory without accepting\nclassical foundationalism. For example, some might agree that we do\nhave some knowledge by acquaintance and appeal to such knowledge in\nthe dualism debate in the philosophy of mind (see the entry on\n qualia: the knowledge argument),\n without endorsing the claim that all knowledge or justified belief\nmust depend, ultimately, on acquaintance. However, unless otherwise\nindicated, we use “acquaintance theory” and\n“classical foundationalism” interchangeably. \nAcquaintance is typically taken to be simple and thus indefinable. The\nphilosophers for whom acquaintance plays a critical philosophical role\nare usually unapologetic about their inability to define the concept\n(e.g., Fumerton 1995: 76–7). They will quite plausibly argue\nthat analysis requires conceptual “atoms”—simple\nideas out of which other ideas are built. The concept of acquaintance,\nfor them, is arguably the most fundamental concept on which all\nepistemology, and perhaps all philosophy of mind, is built. Still, one\nphilosopher’s conceptual atom is another’s complete\nmystery, and unless one can convince oneself that one understands what\nacquaintance is, one will not be able to understand views that invoke\nit. \nTo be sure, one can use metaphors of one sort or another to explain\nthe concept, but the metaphors are as likely to be misleading as\nhelpful. The pain one feels, one might say, is “before”\nthe mind. There is nothing “between” one and the pain one\nfeels. But these are spatial metaphors and the relation between\none’s self and that with which one is acquainted is not really\nall that much like a spatial relation. Even if there is no object\nbetween a chair and a table, the space between them is composed of\nother spaces, and in virtue of this we can compare different spaces or\ndistances quantitatively; in contrast, acquaintance with something is\nnot composed of further relations, and so different relations of\nacquaintance cannot be compared quantitatively in a parallel way. One\ncan add that acquaintance is a non-intentional or nonjudgmental form\nof awareness, and that one cannot be aware of something in this way\nwithout its existing, but the concept of awareness remains unanalyzed,\nand these conditions merely assert that, and shed no light on why,\nacquaintance has these features. \nIf the usual view is correct and acquaintance is simple and\nunanalyzable, nevertheless, perhaps one can point to it by describing\nit in some revealing way that is unique to it. Unfortunately, the\nattempt at pointing involves controversial presuppositions. But\nimagine the following sort of familiar case. One is in pain but as one\nengages in an interesting conversation, one doesn’t notice the\npain for a while. After the conversation ends, one is again aware of\nthe pain. There are two possibilities. One is that the pain\ntemporarily ceased. The other is that the pain continued, but that the\nsubject was temporarily unaware of it. On the supposition that the\nlatter makes sense, acquaintance is that relation the subject had to\npain before the conversation, the relation that ceased during the\nconversation, and that began again shortly thereafter.  \nThe acquaintance theory is controversial, the idea that some things\ncan simply be “given” to the subject has often been\ndenounced as a “myth” (Sellars 1963), and those committed\nto acquaintance disagree about its nature and its objects. All this\nmay seem to be a source of embarrassment for the acquaintance\ntheorist, for how could doubts and disagreements arise regarding what\nis supposed to be immediately and transparently present to\nconsciousness? But there is no need for embarrassment. For the\nproponent of acquaintance or the given, the lesson of these doubts and\ndisagreements is that from the fact that something is given it does\nnot follow that everything about the nature of the given or its\nepistemic role is itself given; “profound puzzles can arise, and\nlegitimately demand solution, even in connection with that which is\nindubitable” (Fales 1996: 2). (For some elaboration on the\nacquaintance theorist’s response to the existence of such doubts\nand disagreements, see the\n concluding remarks.) \nSome acquaintance theorists seem to disagree about the nature of\nacquaintance. Fumerton regards acquaintance as a sui generis\nrelation; it “cannot be informatively subsumed under a\ngenus, and…cannot be analyzed into any less problematic\nconcepts” (1995: 76). It is an irreducible relation that can\nhold between a self and some object, state, property, or fact. Like\nFumerton and other acquaintance theorists, BonJour agrees that there\nis a form of awareness that is nonjudgmental and that is\n“infallible” in the sense that it requires the existence\nof its object; and like other classical foundationalists, he takes all\njustified beliefs (or at least all justified empirical beliefs) to\ndepend, ultimately, on this form of awareness. Unlike Fumerton\nhowever, BonJour (2003) takes this awareness to be a\n“built-in” or intrinsic to conscious or experiential\nstates. On this view, awareness is not a relation between the self and\nsomething else, but is an intrinsic feature of the mental state\nitself, though one that is still relational in the sense that it is\ndirected at something; and what one is aware of is just the specific\ncharacter or content of that state of awareness. So, while Fumerton\ntakes the fundamental awareness or acquaintance to be a relation,\nBonJour takes it to be an intrinsic feature of all experiences or\nconscious states. Awareness or acquaintance is perhaps most naturally\nthought of as a relation between a self and something else: we\ntypically talk of people, animals, persons, selves, minds,\netc. being aware of things, states, properties, or\nfacts. However, a view that regards the most fundamental sort of\nawareness as an intrinsic property of certain mental states might\nstill be able to make sense of such talk: to say that I am directly\naware of X is just to say that I am in a state with\n“built-in” awareness of X. \nBonJour’s view is similar to the view that conscious states are\nself-representational in that the awareness of some content or feature\nof the state is itself part of that state, but it is important not to\noverstate the similarity. For BonJour, conscious states are in a\nsense, as Chisholm might put it, self-presenting, but they\nare not self-representing. BonJour denies that direct\nawareness of something is intentional or representational, or that it\nessentially involves a thought about or representation of it.\nAgain, like all acquaintance theorists, he takes the sort of awareness\nunderlying all foundationally justified belief to be unmediated by any\nbelief or representation, and to guarantee the existence of its\nobject: one cannot be directly aware of something that does not exist.\n \nBonJour’s view of acquaintance seems to explain why, as\nproponents of the acquaintance approach tend to hold, one cannot be\nacquainted with external world objects or external world facts\n(BonJour 2001: 31). If acquaintance is a “built-in”\nfeature of conscious states in virtue of which one can be aware only\nof intrinsic features of that very state, then on the plausible\nassumption that ordinary physical objects and their intrinsic features\nare not intrinsic features of mental states, one cannot have\nacquaintance with such objects or their features. On the other hand,\nFumerton’s relational view of acquaintance, like the traditional\nRussellian view, seems to allow for the possibility of acquaintance\nwith abstract entities such as universals, which some acquaintance\ntheorists appeal to in order to make sense of the possibility of\nthought and a priori knowledge\n (see section 4).\n There is room for more work here in investigating the nature of\nacquaintance and its implications. \nIt’s also worth noting that although talk of acquaintance often\nbrings sense-datum theory to mind, there is nothing about the\ncommitment to acquaintance itself that entails such a commitment.\nAccording to sense datum theory, whenever one has a sensory experience\nas of some object having some property F, there is some object\npresent that has the property F. For example, if I have a\nsensory experience as of a green triangle, then there is something\npresent that is green and triangular. And since I could have this\nsensory experience even while hallucinating (at least according to\nsense datum theorists), this object that is green and triangular is\nnot a physical object. In contrast to the sense datum theorist who\ntreats the sensed property F as a feature of some object of\nwhich the subject is aware, the adverbialist or advocate of the theory\nof appearing treats it as a way of sensing or experiencing. To dance a\nwaltz is not to do something or perform some act, viz., dancing, that\ntakes something else, a waltz, as its object, but is rather a way or\nmanner of dancing—dancing waltzily; similarly, to experience or\nhave an appearance of green is not to have an act of awareness that\ntakes a green object as its target, but is rather a way of\nexperiencing or being appeared to—“experiencing\ngreenly”, or “being appeared to greenly.” The\nacquaintance approach is compatible with adverbialism regarding sense\nexperience; one might be acquainted with experiential states, and with\none’s experiencing greenly, as opposed to being acquainted with\nsome green object, and with its being green. (See, for example,\nFumerton 1985: 94–5; McGrew 1995: 93–4; and Chalmers 2010:\n291.) Alternatively, some acquaintance theorists take perceptual or\nsensory experience to involve acquaintance with universals,\nand hope thereby to avoid problems with both the sense datum theory\nand the adverbial theory. For an interesting defense of this view, see\nForrest (2005). (For more on sense datum theory and adverbialism, see\nthe entry on\n the problem of perception.) \nAs we have seen, the familiar experience of temporarily failing to\nnotice one’s pain while engrossed in conversation serves as a\npotential illustration of acquaintance. In at least some such cases,\nthe pain does not disappear entirely, even though one no longer\nnotices it. Some may be inclined to deny that one can have a pain\nwithout being in some way aware or conscious of the pain. (BonJour\n2003 seems to hold this view. See also, Chalmers 2010: 291.) But it\ndoes seem that the sort of case Fumerton describes is a genuinely\npossible, indeed frequent, occurrence, and that the act of noticing\none’s pain is not a mere predication of one concept to another\n(e.g., predication of the concept pain to the concept\npresent experience), but an act of fixing one’s mental\ngaze, so to speak, on some particular feature or aspect of one’s\nexperience. A relation of acquaintance seems to provide just what is\nneeded here: if acquaintance is a relation that one can stand in to\none’s experience or to some feature of the experience, that\nwould account for the possibility of having an experience of\nsomething, like a pain or some other sensation, temporarily failing to\nnotice it, and then noticing it again. Can BonJour’s account\nhandle such cases as well? BonJour does qualify the awareness required\nfor justification in a particular way that may help him to make sense\nof such cases. I can be conscious of or directly aware of a great many\nfeatures simultaneously, but can attend to only a few\nfeatures at any one time. For BonJour, attention is not entirely\nseparate from the built-in awareness, but is “built upon it via\nwhat might be described as a selective focus” (2003: 192). So,\nwhile I cannot be in pain without being conscious of or aware of the\npain, I can be in pain without attending specifically or selectively\nto the pain. Gertler (2001) presents an account of the justification\nof introspective beliefs that takes attention as a primitive, direct\nawareness. Though the connection to acquaintance is not explicit\nthere, in more recent work Gertler defends the same view as an\n“acquaintance approach” to introspective knowledge, so\ncalled because it is inspired by Russell’s theory of\nacquaintance (2011, 2012). She seems to regard demonstrative attention\n(the sort of attention that makes possible introspective judgments\nwith demonstrative content, e.g., “I am experiencing\nthis property”) as made possible by acquaintance\n(2012). Taylor (2013) discusses a number of phenomenological and\ntheoretical advantages to identifying acquaintance with attentive\nawareness. \nTo summarize, there is a great deal of agreement among philosophers\nwho adopt the acquaintance approach: they all take there to be an\nepistemically fundamental awareness that is unmediated and\nnonconceptual, a form of awareness that secures the existence of its\nobject. There seems to be some disagreement regarding the nature of\nacquaintance, e.g., whether it is fundamentally a relation between the\nself and the target of awareness, or an intrinsic,\n“built-in” aspect or feature of some mental states; and\nwhether it consists in attention. There may also be some disagreement\nregarding the possible objects or targets of acquaintance. And, as we\nshall see below, there is also some disagreement regarding the proper\nanalysis of noninferential knowledge or justified belief, and how\nacquaintance figures in that analysis. \nFoundationalism regarding justification is often motivated by some\nversion of the regress argument. (Foundationalism regarding knowledge\ncan be motivated by a parallel version of the regress argument, put in\nterms of knowledge rather than justification.) The argument goes\nroughly as follows. By definition, any belief B that is an\ninstance of nonfoundational or inferential justification must depend\non some inference or inferential relation to other beliefs. It seems\nthat this dependence on other beliefs must take one of four forms: (i)\nthe belief depends inferentially on other beliefs, and the latter\nbeliefs on yet other beliefs, to infinity; (ii) the inference\neventually loops back to belief B, so that B depends on\nitself for its justification; (iii) the belief ultimately depends on\nother beliefs that are not themselves justified; or (iv) the belief\nultimately depends on a foundationally justified belief: a belief that\nis justified but that does not depend on other beliefs for its\njustification. The foundationalist argues that each of the\nalternatives to (iv) is seriously problematic: (i) An infinite regress\nis vicious, and even if it isn’t, this is no help for finite\nminds like our own. (ii) Circular reasoning is vicious; one cannot\ndepend, even in part, on a belief that p in order to justify\nbelieving that p. (iii) One cannot generate justification by\nrelying on unjustified beliefs (“garbage in, garbage\nout!”). So that leaves (iv): if any of our beliefs are\njustified, then they must either be foundationally justified or\ndepend, ultimately, on foundational beliefs for their\njustification. \nSome worry that (iv) is no better, and possibly worse, than the\nalternatives: how could a belief be justified, or be an instance of\nknowledge, without depending on other beliefs? The acquaintance\ntheorists seems to have an answer: acquaintance with facts is designed\nto end the potentially vicious regress of justification. But how\nexactly do we get noninferential knowledge or justified belief out of\nacquaintance? An acquaintance theorist who accepts the correspondence\ntheory of truth can provide a relatively straightforward answer. On\nwhat is surely the classical conception of truth, truth consists in\ncorrespondence between the truth bearer (the proposition, thought, or\nbelief) and the representation-independent fact to which that truth\nbearer corresponds (see the entry on\n the correspondence theory of truth).\n The question of what constitute the primary bearers of truth value is\na matter of enormous controversy. Suppose, though, for this discussion\nthat it is a thought that is the primary bearer of truth value\n(sentences are derivatively true or false when they express thoughts\nthat are true or false). \nOn a simple version of this view (perhaps too simple to have any\ncontemporary proponents, but an instructive place to start), we have\nnoninferential or foundational knowledge that P if and only\nif we have the thought that P while we are directly\nacquainted with the fact that P—i.e., a truth-maker of\nthe thought that P. So if I am the kind of being who has the\nconceptual sophistication to form thoughts, and I have the thought\nthat I am in pain while I am acquainted with the fact that I am in\npain, I have the most secure and basic sort of knowledge of truth. \nWe said earlier that acquaintance is not itself judgmental or\npropositional, and so does not have truth value—it is a form of\nawareness of something, not awareness that something\nis so-and-so. However, this leaves open the possibility that the\nobject or target of acquaintance—that with which one is\nacquainted—be propositional or have truth value. If I am\nacquainted with the proposition or thought that I am in pain then I am\nacquainted with something that has truth value, even though\nacquaintance itself is not to be understood as propositional in\nnature. The simple view we are considering might hold that one has\nfoundational knowledge that one is in pain if, in addition to being\nacquainted with one’s being in pain, one is also acquainted with\nthe thought or proposition that one is in pain.  \nThis view of how we get from acquaintance to noninferential knowledge\nor justified belief is problematic, however. First, the account seems\ntoo weak, for acquaintance with a fact that corresponds to a thought\nis not sufficient for justification, let alone knowledge.\nSuppose that I am aware of the fact of there being a decagon in my\nvisual field. Suppose that I also believe that there is a decagon\nin my visual field, but my belief is little more than a lucky guess,\nor that I only believe this because I think there always is a decagon in my visual field. Intuitively, the belief is not justified.\nSecond, the account seems too strong, for the requirement that\none’s thought correspond to reality rules out the possibility of\nfalse noninferentially justified belief. The resulting\ninfallibilism regarding foundational belief is a prima facie\nimplausible requirement, and arguably has radically skeptical\nconsequences. This second problem will be taken up later, in\n section 6. \nContemporary acquaintance theorists have defended more sophisticated\nversions of the view. In response to the first problem, the\nacquaintance theorist can agree that in order to be justified it is\nnot enough that the subject be acquainted with a fact that happens to\ncorrespond to what is believed. It will be useful to divide the\nresponses into two broad camps, introduced in the next two\nsub-sections: those that require, in addition to acquaintance with\nsome fact, some sort of awareness of the correspondence between the\nthought and what it is about (or perhaps awareness of some other\nepistemically relevant relation—see the end of\n section 6),\n and those that require that the beliefs involve demonstrative or\nphenomenal concepts.  \nWhy is acquaintance with a fact that corresponds to one’s\nthought not sufficient for justification? Consider the example\nmentioned above. I can be directly aware of there being a decagon\nin my visual field, believe that there is a decagon in my visual\nfield, and yet I might fail to be justified if I believe this not\nbecause I am unaware of there being a decagon in my visual field,\nbut because my belief was little more than a guess, or because I\nbelieve (without justification) that there are always decagons in\nmy visual field. This might suggest that the acquaintance theorist\nneed only add some condition to the effect that the subject must\nbelieve that p because she is aware of a corresponding fact.\nMost acquaintance theorists will not be entirely happy with this\nsuggestion. Acquaintance theorists are paradigm internalists about\njustification: they typically accept the internalist thesis that one\ncan be justified in believing that p only if one has a reason\nor evidence in favor of p’s truth, something in virtue\nof which the truth of p is not a mere accident from his or\nher perspective; externalists deny this thesis (see the entry on\n internalist vs. externalist conceptions of epistemic justification).\n Acquaintance theorists are therefore likely to insist that awareness\nof the fact that p cannot provide justification for believing\nthat p unless the subject is in some way also aware of the\nrelevance of that fact to the truth of p. This awareness of\nthe relevance of some fact to the truth of p might be\naccepted as part of\n the epistemic basing relation,\n and for this reason necessary for “doxastic\njustification”: in order for S to be justified in\nbelieving that p on the basis of some ground or evidence\ne, S must be aware of the relevance of e to\np’s truth, and believe that p directly because\nof this awareness. Alternatively, the awareness of the relevance of\nsome fact to the truth of p might be taken as a condition for\neven “propositional justification”: in order for S\nto have or possess noninferential justification for believing that\np (even if S does not believe that p, or\ndoes not properly base the belief on that justification), S\nmust not only be acquainted with some fact that is relevant to the\ntruth of p, but must also be aware, in some way, of the\nrelevance of that fact to the truth of p. Moser (1989:\n141–5) seems to endorse a view of the former sort, while\nFumerton (1995) endorses the latter. (While the distinction between\npropositional and doxastic justification is important, to simplify\ndiscussion, we do not distinguish carefully between these below.) \nAccording to Fumerton, a belief that p is noninferentially\njustified if and only if the subject is acquainted with the thought\nthat p, acquainted with a corresponding fact, and acquainted\nwith the correspondence between the thought that p and that\ncorresponding fact. (Fumerton qualifies the analysis to accommodate\nfalse noninferentially justified beliefs, but let us ignore this for\nthe moment.) Suppose that I am acquainted with my having a headache,\nacquainted with the thought that I have a headache, and acquainted\nwith the correspondence between the thought that I have a headache and\nmy having a headache. When this happens, everything constitutive of\nthe thought’s being true is there directly before my mind.\nEpistemically speaking, it doesn’t get any better than this. \nBonJour’s account of noninferentially justified belief similarly\nrequires not only direct awareness of some fact, but also a\n“direct recognition” of the “fit”\nbetween that fact and the conceptual description embodied in the\nbelief (BonJour 2003: 73–4). Both Fumerton and BonJour thus\nrequire some sort of awareness or grasp of the correspondence between\na thought and what it is about. However, while Fumerton’s\nacquaintance with correspondence is acquaintance with a fact and not a\njudgment that a proposition is true, BonJour seems to understand the\n“recognition” of fit or correspondence as judgmental or\npropositional—something like a judgment to the effect that the\nconceptual description embodied in the belief fits or correctly\ndescribes one’s experience. This naturally leads to the\nquestion, must this judgment of fit itself be justified? And if so,\nwhat justifies it? BonJour insists (2003: 65 and 193) that while the\njudgment of fit requires justification, its justification depends on\none’s direct awareness of the propositional content believed and\na direct awareness of the relevant experiential feature, and that\nthere is no need for any further awareness, judgmental or otherwise.\nThis response seems problematic, however, for we now have at least one\nsort of belief or judgment, the higher-order judgment of fit itself,\nthat is noninferentially justified without there being any awareness\nor recognition that its propositional content fits the facts.\nIf a judgment of fit is required for the first-order belief,\nshouldn’t the same be required for the judgment of fit itself?\nBut if it is required then we are off on a regress of judgments of\nfit, with no foundation in sight. This suggests, in line with\nFumerton’s view, that if some awareness of fit or correspondence\nis required, then it must at the most fundamental level be a\nnonconceptual and nonpropositional awareness of fit or correspondence.\n \nNot all acquaintance theorists require acquaintance with the\ncorrespondence (or some other epistemically relevant relation) between\nsome thought or proposition and a distinct fact for one to have\nknowledge by acquaintance. Rather than require a further act of\nawareness, some acquaintance theorists add constraints to the nature\nof the foundational belief or the manner in which it is formed so that\nacquaintance with some mental state or mental feature provides part of\nthe content of the belief itself, and does so in such a way as to\nguarantee the truth of the belief. For example, according to McGrew\n(1995, 1999), for any object of acquaintance or direct awareness, it\nis possible to form a belief in which a demonstrative concept refers\ndirectly to it. By virtue of my acquaintance with a painful\nexperience, I believe directly of it that it exists, or that the\nproperty (painfulness) is instantiated. We could express the belief\nroughly by saying “I am experiencing this”\n(McGrew 1995, 1999), or “this is instantiated (in me,\nnow)” (Gertler 2012). For this kind of belief (unlike\nmost other beliefs regarding contingent facts), to genuinely\nunderstand or grasp the content of the belief is to grasp its\ntruth.  \nIt is important to see how this is different from the standard view of\ndemonstrative concepts. On the standard view, a demonstrative concept\nis something like an indexical (see the entry on\n indexicals).\n Consider indexical concepts like I, here, and now.\nThe reference of these concepts is fixed by the context, by the\nspeaker or thinker’s identity, location, and time. On the\nstandard view, the content of a token indexical concept is\nconstituted by or essentially tied to the actual referent, much as the\ncontent of the concept water is constituted by or essentially\ntied to the actual referent in the environment (at least according to\ncontent-externalism about natural-kind concepts). The standard view of\ndemonstratives is similar. The actual referent of a token\ndemonstrative concept is taken to constitute or be essential to its\ncontent, but unlike the indexical concepts just discussed, the\nreference of a demonstrative is not fixed automatically by the\nspeaker’s identity, location and time; something else is needed\nto fix the reference. Different views of the reference-fixing factor\nhave been proposed, with the main suggestions being that reference is\nfixed by one or more of the following: a demonstration,\nunderstood as an act of pointing or gesturing or some similar\nbehavior; an intention to point or refer to an object of a\ncertain kind, or an object satisfying some description; or some\nappropriate causal or spatial relation (e.g., between the\nagent’s pointing or utterance and some item in the environment).\nWhat is important for our purposes is that none of these views take\nthe reference-fixing to be done purely by acquaintance or direct\nawareness. On McGrew’s view, the reference is fixed by\ndirect awareness, and not by acts of pointing or gesturing,\nby the subject’s intentions to refer to a certain sort of thing,\nor by causal relations.  \nMcGrew is not alone in holding that experiential or phenomenal\nfeatures can, by virtue of our direct awareness of them, constitute\nthe content of a special class of concepts. Gertler (2001, 2011,\n2012), Chalmers (2003, 2010), and Nida-Rümelin (2004) defend\nviews very much in the same spirit. Gertler (2001) distinguishes\nbetween ordinary demonstratives, which typically involve an intention\nto pick out an entity that satisfies some description, and a\npure demonstrative, which picks out its referent solely by a\nfundamental act of attention or acquaintance. Chalmers (2003, 2010)\ndefends a similar view according to which some noninferential beliefs\nare justified by virtue of involving a “direct phenomenal\nconcept,” a concept whose content is constituted by a\nphenomenal quality with which one is acquainted. The view is supported\nby considering Frank Jackson’s (1982) hypothetical case of Mary,\nwho has learned all of the physical facts about color but has never\nhad a visual experience in color until one day she experiences red.\nJackson argues there that Mary thereby learns some new information;\nshe acquires some new knowledge. And since Mary already knows all the\nphysical facts about color, this new item of knowledge must, Jackson\nargues, be of a non-physical fact. Chalmers (2010) and\nNida-Rümelin (2004) argue that it is difficult to make sense of\nthe epistemic progress of subjects like Jackson’s Mary unless we\naccept that there is a core phenomenal concept whose content is\nconstituted by an underlying phenomenal or experiential quality with\nwhich the subject is acquainted. Chalmers (2004) relies on the\nacquaintance approach to phenomenal concepts to defend the knowledge\nargument for dualism—i.e., the claim that Mary acquires new\nknowledge, and that this must be knowledge of a non-physical\nfact. (He notes (2003: 227) that demonstratives are naturally\nused to express direct phenomenal concepts (e.g., “I am\nexperiencing this quality”), and that there may be a\nsense in which a direct phenomenal concept is a\n“demonstrative” concept, but he avoids such a label at\nleast in part because of the danger of confusing direct phenomenal\nconcepts with demonstrative ones as usually understood.) It is worth\nnoting that, in contrast, some philosophers appeal to knowledge by\nacquaintance to make sense of Mary’s new knowledge in order to\noppose, rather than to support, the success of the knowledge argument\nfor a dualistic conclusion (e.g., Conee 1994 and Balog 2012).  \nMcGrew endorses classical foundationalism, taking all our empirical\nknowledge to rest on a foundation of knowledge that is had by\nacquaintance or direct awareness, and in particular on demonstrative\nbeliefs. While Chalmers and Gertler seem somewhat sympathetic to\nclassical foundationalism, they have been concerned primarily to\ndefend the claim that at least some introspective beliefs or beliefs\nregarding one’s own phenomenal states constitute the most secure\nsort of empirical, noninferential knowledge or justified belief, and\nthat these beliefs owe their privileged epistemic status to\nacquaintance. Thus, Gertler (2012) endorses the acquaintance approach\nfor a limited class of introspective judgments, and leaves it open\nwhether there could be other sources of noninferential\njustification. \nSome worry that the demonstrative strategy yields beliefs with very\nlittle content (Sosa 2003b). If, however, we keep in mind that the\ncontent of the belief is secured by the subject’s direct\nawareness of the phenomenal features themselves then it is unclear why\nthe content can’t be as rich as the features attended to. A more\nserious worry in the vicinity is that, insofar as a demonstrative\nconcept is only possessed by the subject for as long as the\nparticular experience or property instance is given or presented, we\nhave no account of how concepts that the subject can possess over time\nas experiences change can be applied directly to experience. Even if\npurely demonstrative beliefs have an important role to play at the\nfoundations, many classical foundationalists will want to allow that\nsome concepts that we already possess can be compared directly to\nexperience to yield foundational knowledge. Unless some foundational\nbeliefs involve such enduring concepts, concepts whose connections to\nother concepts we have had the opportunity to grasp, it will be\ndifficult to see how these foundations could support various other\nbeliefs that are intuitively justified. To accommodate such\nfoundations, Chalmers (2003) suggests that subjects might retain\nknowledge of what an experience is like even after the experience is\nlong gone, by acquiring what he calls a standing phenomenal\nconcept. Standing phenomenal concepts are still very much like direct\nphenomenal concepts in that the content is essentially tied to\nphenomenal properties. While Chalmers does not say exactly what\ndetermines the content of such concepts, he finds it \nplausible that their content is determined by some combination of (1)\nnon-sensory phenomenal states of a cognitive sort, which bear a\nrelevant relation to the original phenomenal quality in\nquestion—e.g., a faint Humean phenomenal ‘idea’ that\nis relevantly related to the original ‘impression’; (2)\ndispositions to have such states; and (3) dispositions to recognize\ninstances of the phenomenal quality in question. (2003: 239) \nSo far we have been talking primarily about the role of acquaintance\nin securing a special kind of knowledge. There is, however, another\ncrucial role acquaintance has been thought to play. For philosophers\nlike Russell, acquaintance secures not only the objects of knowledge\nbut the objects of thought itself; it explains not only how knowledge\nis possible, but also how thought is possible. This is so not just for\na special class of thoughts about experiences or experiential\nqualities as some hold (see\n section 3.2,\n on demonstrative and phenomenal concepts), but for thought in\ngeneral. The idea actually goes back to the empiricists who claimed\nthat all simple ideas have their source in experience. When refined\nthe suggestion probably amounted to the view that all simple ideas are\nderived from objects or properties with which we are acquainted or of\nwhich we are directly aware. On Russell’s version of the view,\nwhenever you form a thought, the components of that thought are items\nwith which you are acquainted: \nEvery proposition which we can understand must be composed\nwholly of constituents with which we are acquainted.\n(1912: Ch. 5)  \nYou can, to be sure, think of Jack the Ripper, but the thought when\nanalyzed is broken down into constituents each of which is something\nwe can apprehend directly. The name “Jack the Ripper” gets\nreduced to a description embedded in a quantified statement. The\nthought that Jack the Ripper is vicious just is the thought\nthat there exists one and only one individual who has certain\nproperties—e.g., who is the most famous 19th Century\nmurderer—and who also has the property of being\nvicious. Russell has always struggled with the question of how to view\nour understanding of the quantifier—expressions of quantity such\nas ‘a’ or ‘the’—but it is clear that he\nbelieved that we have the capacity to entertain in thought (directly)\nthe properties (universals) picked out by predicate expressions. If\nhaving a thought essentially involves acquaintance with universals,\nthen it ceases to be a mystery how thought can represent the world,\nsince the world partly consists in instances or exemplifications of\nuniversals; and if a thought involves acquaintance with universals\nthat happen to be instantiated or exemplified by some object of\nacquaintance, then it makes sense that one can, at least in some\ncases, directly compare and become acquainted with the correspondence\nor fit between the two.  \nThe acquaintance theorist is in a position to offer a different gloss\non the traditional distinction between\n a priori knowledge\n of necessary truth and a posteriori or empirical knowledge\nof contingent truth. On the classical acquaintance theory, knowledge\nof both truths has the same source—acquaintance with facts. The\ndistinction lies with the objects of acquaintance. When I am\nacquainted with my being in pain, that can give me knowledge of the\ncontingent truth that I’m in pain. When I am acquainted with the\nproperty of being red, the property of being yellow and the relation\nof being darker than holding between them, that can give me knowledge\nof the necessary truth that red is darker than yellow. When I am\nacquainted with being triangular and being trilateral and the relation\nof inclusion holding between them, that can give me knowledge of the\nnecessary truth that triangles are trilateral. When I am acquainted\nwith being a circle, and having corners, and the relation of exclusion\nbetween them, that can give me knowledge of the necessary truth that\ncircles have no corners. For similar views of the nature of thought\nand the a priori, see Bealer (1982: Ch. 8, especially\n187–90) and BonJour (1998: Ch. 6).  \nAn acquaintance theorist aiming to provide a general account of\nknowledge owes us an account not only of noninferential knowledge, but\nalso of inferential knowledge. How can we get at least reasonable or\njustified belief when we are not directly acquainted with the truth\nmakers of those beliefs, the facts that make the beliefs true? Again,\nwe stress that the question we are concerned with here is not how we\ncan get knowledge of truths in contrast to knowledge of something\nother than a truth. We have already suggested that knowledge by\nacquaintance should be thought of as knowledge of a truth made\npossible by acquaintance with the truth maker. The question, rather,\nconcerns how we can get knowledge of a truth when we are not\nacquainted with the truth maker. For the classical acquaintance\ntheorist, that question, in turn, reduces to the question of how we\ncan acquire knowledge through inference. \nThere are at least two possible answers the acquaintance theorist\nmight give. A view we might call inferential externalism suggests that\nto acquire inferential knowledge that Q by inferring\nQ from P it is enough that P makes highly\nprobable Q. The relation of making probable, itself, can be\ninterpreted in many different ways. A detailed discussion of\ninterpretations of probability would take us too far afield, so let us\nbe content with a few very brief remarks (see the entry on\n interpretations of probability).\n One might try to understand probability in terms of frequency.\nRoughly the idea is that P makes Q probable when\nP and Q form a pair of propositions of a certain\nkind, where usually when the first member of a pair of propositions of\nthat sort is true then so is the second. Alternatively, some\nphilosophers would follow Keynes (1921) and argue that there are\nrelations of making probable that hold between propositions analogous\n(in some ways) to the relation of entailment that holds between\npropositions. On this view, when P makes probable Q,\nit is a necessary truth that P makes probable Q\n(though that necessary truth is perfectly consistent with the fact\nthat the conjunction of P and X might not make\nprobable Q). \nMost classical foundationalists at least implicitly rejected the idea\nthat the mere obtaining of a probability relation between one’s\nnoninferential evidence that P and the proposition Q\none infers from that evidence is sufficient to acquire inferential\njustification or inferential knowledge. Rather, they insisted, one\nmust be aware of or have access to the probabilistic connection that\nobtains between one’s premises and one’s conclusion.\nDirect acquaintance with facts was proposed to end a potentially\nvicious regress of justification\n (see section 3),\n but now the regress looms again in connection with knowledge of\nprobabilistic connections. How can one get knowledge of probabilistic\nconnections between premises and conclusions? If one infers the\nexistence of the probabilistic connections from the truth of some\nother different proposition F, then one not only needs\njustification for believing F, but, one needs justification\nfor believing that F does indeed make probable that the\nprobabilistic connection holds! The problem here is essentially the\none that has been pointed out by Lewis Carroll (1895), though he\napplied the problem to deductive inference. BonJour (2005) cites this\nproblem as a reason for taking a direct, nonpropositional grasp of\nlogical relations as crucial to inferential justification, at least\nfor deductive inferences; similarly, Fumerton (2015) argues that, to\nhalt the regress, the internalist should require a direct awareness of\nrelations of making probable between propositions. But are we aware of\nsuch relations? The problem seems hopeless if one understands\nprobability in terms of frequency, for we do not seem to have any\ndirect access to such complex, contingent facts as the ratio that one\nproposition is true relative to another (logically independent) one.\nThat seems to be the sort of thing one can only know by extensive\nobservation, data gathering, or empirical research, and the question\nof how we know that some observation makes probable our judgment of\nprobability arises all over again. But if one can convince oneself\nthat there are real logical relations of making probable holding\nbetween propositions, then perhaps the acquaintance theorist can\nsecure the required knowledge of those connections once again through\nacquaintance. Ramsey (1926) famously objected that we do not seem to\nperceive such relations of making probable, but Hasan (2017) argues\nthat these objections are weak, and that there are good reasons to\nthink we can be directly aware of such relations. This version of the\nacquaintance theory relies critically on the fundamental concept of\nacquaintance in understanding both noninferential and inferential\nknowledge. Noninferential knowledge is secured by direct acquaintance\nwith truth makers. Inferential knowledge is secured by direct\nacquaintance with logical and probabilistic connections between known\npropositions and other propositions. \nAn acquaintance theory of justification that requires acquaintance\nwith a proposition’s truth maker in order for the subject to be\njustified in believing the proposition may seem to require too much.\nThe requirement rules out the possibility of false\nnoninferentially justified belief, and the problem is that there seem\nto be plausible examples of such beliefs. Suppose that I am\nexperiencing what seems to be a marginal or border-line case of pain,\nand that I believe it is an experience of pain. But suppose that, as\nit turns out, my belief is false; the experience is not a pain but,\nsay, a painless itch. Prima facie, it is plausible that the\nbelief has some degree (perhaps not very much) of justification, the\nsame or very close to the degree of justification I might have in the\n“good” case in which I correctly believe that I\nam experiencing pain on the basis of an experience of marginal pain.\nOther cases might involve mistaking hot and cold, mistaking shades of\nphenomenal color, mistaking the number of speckles in a region of\none’s visual field, and mistaking the content of one’s own\nthoughts. Moreover, even when we restrict our attention to\ntrue noninferentially justified beliefs, it seems plausible\nthat the degree of justification can vary, and we need some way of\naccounting for this. Suppose, for example, that I really am\nexperiencing a marginal case of pain. It is plausible to think that my\nbelief that I am experiencing pain, while true, is not as justified as\nthe belief would be if I were in searing pain.  \nMcGrew (1995, 1999) argues that a kind of certainty or infallibility\n(in his terms, “incorrigibility”) is a necessary feature\nof empirical foundational beliefs: a belief that P is\nempirically foundational only if being justified in believing that\nP guarantees its truth. He defends the view that such\nfoundations are available and that they are adequate to yield\nknowledge of the external world. Other classical foundationalists want\nto allow for the possibility of false foundational beliefs.\n(See Fumerton 1995: 77; BonJour 2003: 73–74; and Fales 1996:\n174–80. For a critique of acquaintance theorists’ attempts\nto accommodate fallibility at the foundations, see Huemer 2007, Poston\n2010, and Tucker 2016. For replies to some of these critiques, see\nFumerton 2010 and 2016, Hasan 2013, and Stoutenburg (forthcoming).\nStoutenburg nevertheless motivates infalliblism, and provides an\naccount of how propositions that moderate foundationalists regard as\nbasic derive their justification from infallibly known\npropositions.) \nIntuitively, we may want to allow that one be justified to some degree\nif the fact with which one is actually acquainted corresponds to a\nproposition that is very similar to the proposition believed (Fumerton\n1995: 77). This might suggest the following principle:  \nOne apparent problem with this suggestion is that the satisfaction of\nthe antecedent does not seem to give the subject a reason to think the\nbelief is true. The problem is clear if we assume, as acquaintance\ntheorists generally do, that a belief can be justified for a subject\nonly if the proposition believed is made probable by the\nsubject’s evidence, or by that with which the subject is\nacquainted. The mere fact that I experience one of these shades fails\nto make probable, indeed, rules out, that I experience the other, and\nso gives me no justification for believing that I experience the\nother. Here’s a second attempt: \nThe problem with this suggestion is that acquaintance or direct\nawareness doesn’t seem to be doing the crucial epistemic work.\nIf the principle is true, why not hold some version of\n“phenomenal conservativism” in epistemology, the position\nthat a propositional awareness—a seeming that x is\nG or an inclination to believe that x is\nG—is a source of defeasible justification for believing\nthat x is G? If so, then the acquaintance or direct\nawareness requirement should be dropped from (2) and there would still\nbe the justification. Here is perhaps a more promising strategy: \nWe get different versions of the acquaintance approach to fallible\nbeliefs depending on what is required for something to “make\nprobable for one”. Acquaintance theorists with strong\ninternalist inclinations are likely to insist that awareness of the\nfact that p cannot justify one in believing that p\nunless the subject is in some way also aware of the fact’s\nmaking it probable that p. \nReflection on some examples suggests the following problem with this\nprinciple. An experience’s being a mere itch does not make it\nprobable that it is a pain, for its being a mere itch rules out its\nbeing a pain; and an experience’s being indeterminately either\nan itch or a pain does not make it probable that it is a pain, for it\nmight just as probably be an itch. Or suppose that I am directly aware\nof a phenomenally red patch in my visual field, and on the basis of\nthis I form the false belief that it is, say, pink; or that I am\ndirectly aware of a determinate shade red1, but I form the\nfalse belief that the patch is red2. Again, principle (3)\ndoes not apply: something’s being red cannot make it probable\nthat it is pink, for there are many other shades of red;\nsomething’s being red1 cannot make it probable that\nit is red2, for being one determinate shade rules out being\nthe other. (See Huemer 2007 for an argument against (2) and (3) along\nthese lines, though one that employs some different examples.) \nThe problem, however, might not be with principle (3) itself but with\nthe sorts of features focused on (see Hasan 2013: section 3). There\nmay be other features involved in such apparent cases of fallible\nfoundational justification that do make probable the proposition\nbelieved. For example, consider the following principle, which is a\nspecific version of (3):  \nTucker (2016) presents a dilemma for this proposal: Either the\nrelevant making probable relation is contingent, or it is necessary.\nIf it is contingent, then the justification will be inferential, and\nso the principle can’t account for misleading noninferential\njustification. If it is necessary, then (like (2)), the principle has\ntoo much in common with phenomenal conservatism to be attractive from\nthe point of view of classical foundationalism. A plausible reply\nwould grasp the second horn: Unlike (2), this does not threaten to\ncollapse to conservatism, since it still requires acquaintance with\nsomething epistemically relevant to the target\nproposition—acquaintance with a probability maker (and perhaps\nalso, for those with strong internalist inclinations, acquaintance\nwith the relation of making probable). If the view still has something\nin common with phenomenal conservatism, that might be a point in its\nfavor: it can help capture what the phenomenal conservatism seems to\nget right without accepting it. \nMoser (1989) seems to accept a view along these lines, though he would\nput the fundamental principle in explanatory terms, roughly as\nfollows: \nSo, for example, if one is directly aware of the appearance of a blue\nbook, and such an appearance is best explained for one by the presence\nof an actual blue book, then one has some justification for believing\nthat a blue book is present. For Moser, physical object\nappearances may be given even though physical objects cannot,\nand these appearances may justify beliefs about physical objects\nwithout requiring beliefs about appearances. Though Moser does not\ndiscuss this explicitly, perhaps beliefs regarding our own experiences\ncan be justified in a similar way. If an appearance of pain can be\ngiven to me despite the fact that I am not in pain, and the appearance\nmakes probable or is best explained by the fact that I am actually\nexperiencing pain, then perhaps I have some justification for\nbelieving that I am in pain. Moser thus aims to defend a form of\nfoundationalism that is classical in its commitment to acquaintance or\nthe given, and yet “moderate” not only in holding that\nsome noninferentially justified beliefs can be false, but also that\nsome external world beliefs can be noninferentially justified. A great\ndeal depends, of course, on whether a plausible account of these\nseemings or appearances can be given, and whether a strong enough case\ncan be made for the claim that the truth of the relevant propositions\ndo best explain the appearances (see Moser 1989: 158–165, for a\ndefense of the latter for external-world beliefs).  \nOthers who accept something along the lines of (3) or (4) seem to\nfocus on different features. According to Fales (1996: 175), while\nsomething’s being given to one is not a matter of degree, the\n“transparency” of the given is a matter of degree, and can\nitself be given. When one is thinking that some given experience or\nitem x is G, and one is directly aware of the uncertain\nor not-fully-transparent character of one’s awareness, this can\nmake it merely probable for one that x is G. Fumerton\n(2016: 242) appeals to the controversial idea that correspondence can\ncome in degrees. For example, one can be aware of a shade of color\nthat is closer to the orange part of the color continuum but still\ncorresponds relatively well to the thought that it is red; as the\ncorrespondence gets weaker, the justification one has for the belief\nalso gets weaker. \nAccommodating fallible foundations complicates some aspects of the\ntraditional view introduced above. First, it no longer seems that\nRussell and Price’s criterion that is reminiscent of the method\nof doubt is a very good method for determining what one is acquainted\nwith, for there will be some objects of acquaintance that are\nsusceptible to some degree of doubt. However, the method of doubt\nmight remain useful as a guide to the sort of thing with\nwhich one can be acquainted: for any physical object, I can conceive\nof a case in which any justification I have for believing that it\nexists is just as it is now, and yet there is no such object, and\nnothing remotely like it, in my vicinity. Second, we said above that\nnoninferential knowledge is secured by acquaintance with truth makers,\nwhile inferential knowledge is secured by acquaintance with logical\nand probabilistic connections between the propositions known and what\none infers from those propositions. One natural way for the\nacquaintance theorist to accommodate fallible foundations is to say\nthat p is noninferentially justified for one only if one is\ndirectly aware of some fact that either makes true or\nmakes probable for one that p; if the subject’s\njustification for believing that p depends on one’s\njustification for some other proposition(s) then the\njustification is inferential. \nThose who do find it plausible that they can be directly aware of\nrelations of correspondence between propositions and facts, and who\naccept some internalist requirement to the effect that one must be\naware of the relevance of some fact to the truth of a proposition in\norder for that proposition to be justified for one, may be inclined to\ngo a bit further and accept the possibility of acquaintance with other\nlogical or probabilistic relations between propositional and\nnonpropositional items. As we saw above in discussing inferential\nknowledge, some acquaintance theorists already accept that we can have\nacquaintance with entailment relations and, more controversially,\nepistemic probability relations between propositions. If we can be\naware of similar relations, at the foundational level, between some\npropositions and facts with which we are acquainted, this might\nsignificantly extend the sorts of foundational beliefs satisfying\nstrong internalist requirements. To give just a few simple examples,\nsuppose that I am directly aware of a red triangle in my visual field,\nand also aware of a relation of logical exclusion or incompatibility\n(or, if you like, non-correspondence) between the figure’s being\na red triangle and the proposition that it is green, that it is a\ncircle, or that it has five sides. If acquaintance with correspondence\nis a source of noninferential justification, then perhaps acquaintance\nwith these relations of incompatibility can be a source of\nnoninferential justification for disbelieving these propositions, or\nfor believing their negations—believing that the figure is not\ngreen, that it is not a circle, and that it is not five-sided\nrespectively. According to Moser (1989), we can also be directly aware\nof probabilistic or explanatory relations between propositions and\nnonpropositional items—e.g., between the proposition that there\nis a blue book here, and the given appearance of a blue book (though,\nas already mentioned in\n section 3.1,\n he seems to take this as a requirement for doxastic as opposed to\npropositional justification). \nMany objections and concerns have been raised against the acquaintance\napproach. We here discuss three main ones: the Sellarsian Dilemma,\nSosa’s problem of the speckled hen, and the threat of\nskepticism. \nIn developing the view, we have already responded to one of its most\ncommon criticisms. As was noted above, it has been argued (most\nfamously by Sellars 1963) that even if there were such a thing as\nacquaintance with individuals, properties, or facts, that relation\nwouldn’t give one knowledge of truths. The observation\nis correct (since acquaintance with something does not amount to a\njudgment, let alone a true judgment, about it), but it is irrelevant\nto the more sophisticated view according to which the acquaintance\nwith the relevant fact is only a constituent of the ground of\npropositional knowledge. As we have seen\n (section 3),\n acquaintance theorists typically add conditions that make the fact\nwith which one is acquainted directly relevant to the truth of some\nthought or belief—e.g., by requiring awareness of the\ncorrespondence or fit (or perhaps some other relation) between the\nthought and the fact, or by requiring that the fact constitute part of\nthe content of the belief. \nThese sophisticated views also seem capable of handling a closely\nrelated, influential objection. Inspired by Sellars, BonJour (1978,\n1985) presented the following dilemma for any foundationalist view\nthat takes one’s justification to consist in or depend\nessentially on some sort of awareness, acquaintance, or apprehension.\n(See also, Sellars 1963: Part I, 1975; Davidson 1983; McDowell 1994;\nand Williams 2005.) Is the awareness or acquaintance that is the\nalleged source of noninferential justification propositional or\nconceptual? That is, does it involve the acceptance of a proposition\nor thought, or at least the categorization of some sensory item or the\napplication of some concept to experience? If, on the one hand, the\nacquaintance or awareness is propositional or conceptual in this way,\nthen while such acts or episodes of awareness seem capable, in\nprinciple, of justifying other beliefs, they would surely need to be\njustified themselves. The episode of awareness would involve something\nlike the acceptance of a proposition, and such an attitude clearly\nneeds justification if it is to justify anything else. But then, the\nallegedly foundational belief is not foundational after all. If, on\nthe other hand, we can regard direct awareness as nonpropositional and\nnonconceptual, then while these acts or states of awareness do not\nrequire or even admit of justification—for simply being aware of\nsomething is a mental state that is clearly neither justified nor\nunjustified—they also don’t seem capable on their own of\nproviding a reason or justification for propositional items like\nbeliefs. Therefore, the classical foundationalist’s acquaintance\nor direct awareness cannot serve as a foundational source of knowledge\nor justified belief. \nMost sophisticated versions of classical foundationalism are perhaps\nbest understood as grasping the nonpropositional horn of the dilemma,\nsince acquaintance is a nonpropositional form of awareness. Fumerton\n(1995: 75) replies that while acquaintance itself is nonpropositional,\nthat does not rule out that propositions or thoughts are objects of\nacquaintance or constituents of objects of acquaintance, and if one is\nacquainted with a relation of correspondence between a thought and a\nfact, that would seem to provide all the justification one could need\nor want. As we have seen, BonJour (2003) gives a similar reply that\nappeals to direct awareness of some fact and a direct recognition of\nthe fit between the fact and the proposition believed. He regards this\nrecognition as judgmental or propositional, and that may lead some to\npush the propositional horn again: we need something further to\njustify the judgment of fit, and so the regress of justification has\nnot yet come to an end. (For a response, see BonJour 2003: 193. For\nsome critical discussion, see Bergmann 2006: Ch. 2.) McGrew, Chalmers,\nand others who adopt the demonstrative or phenomenal concept strategy\nmight reply that at least in the case of demonstratively formed\nbeliefs the relevance of the truth maker to the proposition believed\nis transparent and guaranteed by the manner in which the belief is\nformed: acquaintance simply picks out some feature of experience and\ntakes it up into the content of a belief or judgment that asserts that\nthe feature exists or is instantiated. \nRecently, Sosa (2003a,b), Poston (2007) and Markie (2009) have raised\nthe problem of the speckled hen in objection to the acquaintance\ntheorist’s conception of noninferential justification. The\nspeckled hen presents an appearance of, say, 48 speckles. One is, they\nassume, directly acquainted with one’s visual field replete with\nthe 48 speckles. Yet unless one has counted the speckles, one is\nunlikely to have justification for believing that one’s visual\nfield contains the 48 speckles. Even if one guesses correctly the\nnumber of speckles in the field, one’s guess hardly counts as a\njustified belief. Direct acquaintance with truthmakers for one’s\nbelief is, then, clearly not sufficient for noninferential\njustification. \nThere are a number of responses available to the acquaintance theorist\n(see BonJour 2003 and Fumerton 2005). It need not be part of the\nacquaintance theorist’s view that in being directly acquainted\nwith an experience one is directly acquainted with all aspects of the\nexperience. One might be directly acquainted with the fact that one is\nbeing appeared to many-speckledly without being acquainted with the\nfact that one is appeared to 48-speckledly. Think, for example, about\nhow you can be aware of a car’s having a dark color without\nbeing aware of its having a determinate shade. Some may deny that\ncases like the latter are clearly possible, for is one not aware of\nthe specific shade as well, even if one does not have a term or\nconcept for it? Indeed, as we have seen, some acquaintance theorists\nhold that one is acquainted with or directly aware of all intrinsic\nsensory or phenomenal features of one’s experience, including\nspecific shades of color. However, they require in addition that the\nsubject attend to the relevant feature or fact, and so they\nare still able to distinguish between a selective, attentive awareness\nand a more minimal consciousness or peripheral awareness. They may\nattempt in this way to accommodate the intuition that we are conscious\nof or aware of a great deal more than we attend to or notice, while\ninsisting that this attention or noticing is a nonjudgmental awareness\nthat secures its object—a form of acquaintance in our sense.\n(See for example, BonJour 2003: 192 and Chalmers 2010: 88, n. 5. See\n section 2\n above for some elaboration.) On this view, one might attend to\none’s being appeared to many-speckledly without attending to\none’s being appeared to 48-speckledly.  \nOne might also respond that even if one is acquainted with one’s\nbeing appeared to 48-speckledly, one might fail either to have the\nright sort of thought or fail to be directly aware of a correspondence\nrelation holding between this fact and the corresponding thought. It\nmay be that we do not have the simple concepts for such properties,\nand so cannot compare them directly with the contents of experience.\nPerhaps, when one thinks of something’s having 48 speckles, one\ncan think of it, as Russell might say, only by\ndescription (e.g., that number that is picked out by the\nnumeral ‘48’, or by some other description) such that\none’s having the thought does not involve acquaintance with the\nproperty of being 48-speckled. A Russellian about the nature of\nthoughts\n (see section 4)\n might say that we cannot be directly aware of the property\n(universal) of being 48-speckled, and so cannot compare that property\ndirectly with what is experienced. Alternatively, some might say that\nwhile we have phenomenal concepts for color and perhaps some basic\nshapes and numbers, we (most of us anyway) lack the phenomenal concept\nof being 48-speckled (Feldman 2004). On such a view, if my thought\nthat I am appeared to 48-speckledly does not involve such Russellian\nor phenomenal concepts, but rather involves descriptive or complex\ncontents, then it is no surprise that I am not foundationally\njustified in believing that I am appeared to 48-speckledly.  \nAs long as one has an account of why one of the conditions for\nnoninferential justification fails, one is in a position to respond to\nthe objection. \nAlthough it is not always offered explicitly as an argument, many no\ndoubt reject the acquaintance theorist’s account of both\nnoninferential and inferential knowledge out of fear that the account\nwill inevitably lead to a radical skepticism. If knowledge by\nacquaintance is restricted to belief in propositions where one’s\nepistemic situation precludes the possibility of error, critics might\nwell be right in suggesting that we have a tiny body of knowledge\nsecured by direct acquaintance. The rest of what we know or\njustifiably believe must be secured by inference, and the fear is that\nwe simply don’t have anything like the inferential resources to\nget from such a narrow base to commonsense beliefs about the world\naround us. Even if we allow for some fallible foundational beliefs, as\nmany contemporary acquaintance theorists do (see\n section 6),\n one might still worry that the class of facts with which we are\nacquainted do not constitute a very impressive base. How legitimate\nthat fear is depends very much on the analysis of inferential\nknowledge one accepts. If one requires access to probabilistic or\nexplanatory connections as a condition for inferential knowledge, then\nunless one can be acquainted with such connections holding between\npropositions, skepticism does, indeed, loom on the horizon. A number\nof acquaintance theorists are more optimistic, however, that\nskepticism regarding the external world can be avoided (see McGrew\n1995; Moser 1989; BonJour 2003; and Hasan 2018). \nEven should it be true that the classical foundationalist has a view\nthat invites skepticism, it should, perhaps, be an open question as to\nwhether that constitutes a legitimate objection to the view. Classical\nfoundationalists are likely to deny that skeptical implications of a\ntheory of justification generally or automatically discredit it. Even\nif we don’t have good grounds for many of our beliefs, including\nbeliefs regarding the external world, it may be that we need good\ngrounds to be justified and we do not have them. The skeptical\nimplication may be correct rather than objectionable.  \nMany honestly claim that they are not sure what acquaintance is. If\nasked what reason they have for thinking that there is such a thing as\nacquaintance, some acquaintance theorists would reply that they are\nacquainted with their being acquainted with things, or directly aware\nof their being directly aware (Russell 1912: Ch. 5; Fumerton 1995:\n77). Moser provides a useful analogy: \nCompare the parallel situation where one is so absorbed in what is\nhappening on the movie screen that one is completely unaware of\none’s watching a movie. (1989: 78) \nBecoming aware of one’s watching a movie is analogous to\nbecoming acquainted with one’s being acquainted with pain, or\nbecoming acquainted with one’s being acquainted with a shade of\nred. However, if the analogy is apt, the opponent might see it as a\nreason to doubt that the acquaintance relation is really there, for\nonce we reflect on whether we are watching a movie it is almost always\neasy to determine whether we are, but the opponent has no easy time\nfinding any such relation as acquaintance or direct awareness. Of\ncourse, the movie analogy is just that—an analogy. As already\ndiscussed in\n section 2,\n from the acquaintance theorist’s perspective, such analogies\nand metaphors are bound to be misleading in some respects. It might be\nmore fruitful to direct one’s attention to it by describing it\nin some (hopefully) revealing way, as we did in\n section 2:\n acquaintance is that relation the subject had to pain before being\nengrossed in the conversation, the relation that ceased during the\nconversation, and that began again shortly thereafter.  \nMany do find it intuitive and prima facie plausible that they\nare acquainted with or directly aware of at least experiential states\nand their features, and that this direct awareness is a fundamental\nsource of knowledge. Still, some will claim not to find such a\nrelation. It’s not clear how damaging this is to the proponents\nof acquaintance. The fact that doubts and disagreements can arise\nregarding acquaintance or the given should not be too puzzling since\nnot everything about the nature of the given is itself given, and, as\nDescartes observed long ago, one can easily raise doubts regarding\nwhat one can see most clearly and distinctly, at least while one is\nnot attending directly to the appropriate ground or insight. To be\nclear, this is not to say that those who doubt the existence of\nacquaintance must not be trying to attend to it, or even that they are\nsomehow unable to find it; it would be more appropriate to say that\nthey don’t realize that it is acquaintance that they have found,\nor that this realization is fleeting, unstable, or easy to dismiss as\nmerely apparent. Some opponents may actually accept that something\nlike acquaintance exists but doubt that it can provide much, if any,\njustification for our beliefs; in denying that they have found\nanything like acquaintance, it may be that they mean only to deny that\nthey have found a relation of acquaintance that can make a\nsignificant difference to the epistemic justification of our\nbeliefs.  \nBut what of those who deny that they ever find anything like a\nrelation of acquaintance when they introspect or go looking for it?\nShouldn’t such denials raise serious doubts regarding\nacquaintance? To determine the impact of such denials on the\nacquaintance theory, it will help to reflect more carefully on how we\nshould understand them. If we understand the opponents as claiming\nthat they are not directly aware of being directly aware of anything,\nor that they are not acquainted with being acquainted with anything,\nthen they would be presupposing the existence of that which they claim\nnot to find. It seems that we ought, instead, to take them as claiming\nthat they simply do not understand what acquaintance is, or what the\nacquaintance theorist means by ‘acquaintance,’ even after\nattempting to follow the acquaintance theorist’s attempts to\nlead us to grasp or understand it. Dialectically, there seems to be no\nway for the acquaintance theorist to reject this opposing position\nwithout begging the question. However, this does not show that the\nacquaintance theory is false or unjustified. Objections to the very\nintelligibility of critical philosophical concepts (concepts of self,\nuniversals, causation, free will, matter, etc.) are hardly rare in\nphilosophy, and philosophers do not abandon their positions in the\nface of such disagreements. The fact of disagreement between\nphilosophers on fundamental matters may lead to difficulties.\nDisagreement between those who seem to be our intellectual peers or\nequals may suggest that we should lower our confidence in our own\nviews, perhaps even drastically lower our confidence. But these are\nnot difficulties that only the acquaintance theory confronts. So, to\nthe extent that there is an objection or problem with the fact that\nsome deny that there is such a thing as acquaintance, a similar\nproblem seems to afflict most any other philosophical theory.  \nThe acquaintance theorists are aware that their claim to being\nacquainted with acquaintance is unlikely to be of much help to those\nwho claim not to understand what acquaintance is, and may point out\nthat there are other, dialectical considerations in favor of their\nview (see Fumerton 1995: 77; Chalmers 2010: 287; and Taylor 2015). We\nend by summarizing a number of such considerations. While these\nconsiderations are controversial, they suggest that acquaintance\ntheories deserve more serious attention than they have recently\nreceived. Most of these have already been covered above. First,\nacquaintance theorists have defended sophisticated accounts of\nnoninferentially justified belief, and offered responses to classical\narguments against the possibility of such beliefs, like the Sellarsian\ndilemma. Second, a view that accepts the possibility of acquaintance\nwith universals seems able to explain not only how knowledge is\npossible, but also how thought itself is possible, and how a thought\ncan be about something else. Third, the acquaintance theorist\nwho accepts acquaintance with complex universals is in a position to\nprovide an account of our knowledge of necessary truths. Fourth, those\nwho accept acquaintance with logical or probability relations between\npropositions can give a unified treatment of foundational and\nnonfoundational knowledge—a unified treatment of knowledge by\nacquaintance and knowledge by description—and are not as\nvulnerable to the threat of skepticism. Fifth, the sophisticated\nacquaintance theory seems to accommodate two constraints on epistemic\njustification that many find intuitive (though not everyone accepts;\nmany accounts end up rejecting one or the other): justification is\ntruth-conducive, since it requires acquaintance with facts\nthat make true (or at least make probable) our beliefs; and\njustification is internal in the sense that the subject has a\nsecure perspective on the truth, or possesses a kind of assurance of\nthe truth (or probability) via acquaintance with truth-making and\nprobability-making relations. \nOpponents of the theory may seek acquaintance with such relations or\nentities without finding it, or at least, without realizing that it is\nacquaintance that they have found. While acquaintance theorists are\nlikely to take phenomenological considerations seriously, they may\nplausibly argue, first, that it is far from obvious that we are\nnot acquainted with such entities as those just mentioned\n(indeed, many have found it difficult to deny that we can sometimes,\nin very simple cases at least, just “see” the entailment\nrelation between propositions), and second, that the fact that other\nphilosophers disagree about this does not raise a problem specific to\nthe acquaintance theory. Moreover, the significant theoretical\nadvantages gained may more than compensate for any lack of\nphenomenological obviousness.  \nTo summarize: Russell’s distinction between knowledge by\nacquaintance and knowledge by description is arguably best understood\nas a distinction between foundational knowledge of truths acquired by\nacquaintance and nonfoundational knowledge of truths that depend,\nultimately, on foundational knowledge. Acquaintance is a direct,\nnonjudgmental and nonconceptual form of awareness that he took to be\ncrucial for both forms of knowledge. Following Russell, some appeal to\nacquaintance with particular facts to account for the possibility of\nfoundational empirical knowledge; some appeal to acquaintance with\nuniversals to account for the possibility of thought itself; some\nappeal to acquaintance with complex universals to account of the\npossibility of foundational a priori knowledge; and some\nappeal to acquaintance with logical and probabilistic relations to\naccount for the possibility of nonfoundational knowledge or\n“knowledge by description.” Thus, for Russell and many\nother acquaintance theorists, even “knowledge by\ndescription” depends on acquaintance, and in more than one way.\nRecently, more sophisticated forms of the acquaintance theory have\nbeen developed, and responses to central objections offered. Moreover,\nsome philosophers of mind have appealed to acquaintance to either\ndefend, or critique, the knowledge argument for dualism. In light of\nall this, one can expect the relation of acquaintance and the\ndistinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by\ndescription to remain at the center of a number of debates in\nepistemology and the philosophy of mind.
