Until Darwin, the best explanation for these three\nfeatures of the biological was the conclusion of the “argument\nfrom design.” Darwin’s theory of natural selection\nprovides an explanation of all three of these features of the\nbiological realm without adverting to some mysterious designing\nentity, by explaining the process of “the survival of the\nfittest.” But this explanation’s success turns on the\nmeaning of its central explanatory concept,\n‘fitness’. Moreover, since Darwinian theory provides the\nresources for a purely causal account of teleology, wherever it is\nmanifested, its reliance on the concept of ‘fitness’ makes\nit imperative that conceptual problems threatening the explanatory\nlegitimacy of this notion be solved.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe leading idea of Darwin’s theory of natural selection is\noften expressed in terms first coined by Herbert Spencer as the claim\nthat among competing organisms the fittest survive (1864, 144). If\nthere is random variation among the traits of organisms, and if some\nvariant traits fortuitously confer advantages on the organisms that\nbear them, i.e., enhance their fitness, then those organisms will live\nto have more offspring, which in turn will bear the advantageous\ntraits. Whence descent with adaptive modification, i.e.,\nevolution. Evolution by random heritable variation and natural\nselection will explain ever increasing adaptation to given\nenvironments, increasing diversity in the occupation of new\nenvironments, and the complexity of organisms and their parts as their\nlineages adapt to one another and to their environments. \n\nBut what is fitness and how can one tell when a trait enhances\nfitness, or more to the point, when one organism is fitter than\nanother? Opponents of the theory of natural selection have long\nclaimed that the theory is so treated by its proponents as to define\nfitness in terms of rates of reproduction, thus condemning the\nprinciple of the survival of the fittest to triviality: the claim that\nthose organisms with higher rates of reproduction leave more offspring\nis an empty, unfalsifiable tautology bereft of explanatory power. In\nthe century and a half since the publication of On the Origin of\nSpecies biologists have all too often reinforced this objection\nby actually so defining fitness. For example, C.H. Waddington writes,\nin Towards a Theoretical Biology (1968, 19), that the fittest\nindividuals are those that are “most effective in leaving\ngametes to the next generation.” It appears therefore that\nevolutionary theory requires a definition of fitness that will protect\nit from the charges of tautology, triviality, unfalsifiabilty, and\nconsequent explanatory infirmity. If no such definition is in fact\nforthcoming, then what is required by the theory’s adherents is\nan alternative account of its structure and content or its role in the\nresearch program of biology.  \n\nIn an intuitive sense, ‘fitness’ can refer to the\ncorrespondence between the shape of an object and an empty volume it is\nplaced in: a square peg fits into a square hole. In a more abstract\nfashion, one might refer to the properties of an entity and how they\ncorrespond to the constraints of its context. In a biological setting\none could focus on an organism’s traits and how they correspond\nto various aspects of the environment the organism is living\nin. Following biological usage, call this concept ‘ecological\nfitness’. (It has also been called ‘vernacular\nfitness,’ cf. Matthen and Ariew 2002.) The\n‘vernacular’ definition is fraught with\ndifficulties. Suppose, following Dennett (1995) we characterize the\nrelation ‘\\(x\\) is fitter than \\(y\\)’ as follows: \n\nOne may ask, What are these design problems? How many of them are\nthere? Is there any way of measuring the degree to which \\(x\\)\nexceeds \\(y\\) in their solution? Answers to these questions\nsimply reinforce the threat of tautology that faces the theory. To\nbegin with the notion of “design problems” is vague and\nmetaphorical; or, if treated literally, design problems will all be\nones relative to the overarching objective of leaving more\ndescendants. Thus the definition may simply hide the original problem\nof distinguishing fitness from reproductive rates, instead of solving\nit. \n\nSecond, the number of design problems is equal to the number of\ndistinct environmental features that affect survival, and of course\nreproduction, and this number is probably uncountable. Accordingly,\nprima facie, the proposed definition provides no hope of cardinal or\neven ordinal measurement that would enable us to predict or explain\nquantitatively differences in rates of reproduction, and the\nevolutionary processes that depend on these rates. Moreover,\necological fitness accounts may not have provided a satisfactory story\nabout how to carve up the relevant reference environment that is\nsupposed to have an impact on the survival of said organisms (Abrams\n2009). It is no wonder that biologists, sensible of the importance of\npredictive precision and explanatory testability, have had little\ntruck with ecological fitness and have defined ‘\\(x\\) is\nfitter than \\(y\\)’ in terms of quantitatively measurable\nreproductive rates. This tendency of course simply adds force to the\noriginal argument. If the only way to make fitness differences\nscientifically tractable is to trivialize the theory, so much the\nworse for the theory.  \n\nSome philosophers (notably Sober, 2013) have argued that\nevolutionary fitness is a property of populations and not of\nindividual organisms, or alternatively that fitness is a property of\ntraits and not of the individuals that possess them. Individual\nfitness values are, they argue, empirically inaccessible and\npredictively useless. If trait fitness is defined in terms of the\naverage fitness value of individuals bearing the trait, then it will\nturn out that there are individual fitnesses and individual fitness\ndifferences, even if it is the case that evolutionary\nbiologists’ interests are confined to trait fitnesses. This\nclaim has been challenged (cf. Pence and Ramsey 2014): sometimes\nbiologists estimate trait fitnesses by studying individual fitnesses\n(Endler 1986).  \n\nIt has also been held that trait fitness and fitness difference are\nboth something more than and different from the average of individual\nfitnesses and fitness differences. On this view trait fitness is a\nproperty of populations and in part of their population structure,\nthat is, the ways in which traits are distributed in the\npopulation. An example (to be explored further below) is reflected in\ncases where the fitness of a trait depends not just on its incidence\nin a population, but also on its variance within. A trait’s\nvariance in a population cannot be reflected in individual fitness\nany more than the entropy of a volume of gas can be reflected in the\nproperties of any of the individual molecules that compose it and\ncontribute to its entropy. This suggests that trait fitness is not\nreducible to, definable in terms of, or even entirely supervenient on\nthe relationship between individuals (e.g., organisms) and their\nenvironments.  \n\nThe disagreement about whether fitness is a property of biological\nindividuals (genes, genotypes, organisms, families, populations and\nother groups or even species) as opposed to a property of traits of\nthese individuals, has made significant another debate about the\nexplanatory role of fitness in the theory of natural selection. Among\nthose who endorse trait fitness (differences), and not individual\nfitness (differences), as a fundamental explanatory factor in natural\nselection, there is a dispute about whether its explanatory role\nreflects its causal force, or whether trait fitness is a purely\nstatistical concept employed in the theory of natural selection to\nmake demographic predictions about future trait distributions, without\nentering into any causal nexus among the objects so to speak. Thus,\nMatthen and Ariew (2002, 56) write, “Unlike vernacular\n[individual] fitness, predictive [trait] fitness is not a cause of\nselection, or of evolution for that matter…. [P]redictive\nfitness is a measure of evolutionary change not a cause.” This\nview confers an obligation on those who embrace it to explain how the\ntheory of natural selection can provide contingent explanations\nwithout trading in causal relations among its explanatory\nvariables.  \n\nAmong philosophers of biology there has been a wide consensus that\nthe solution to problem of defining individual ‘fitness’\nis given by treating it as a probabilistic disposition. As such it\ncausally intervenes between the relationship of environments to\norganisms that cause it, and the actual rates of reproduction that are\nits effects. Thus, fitness turns out to be a\n“garden-variety” dispositional concept like\n‘magnetic’ or ‘fragile’. These properties, and\nall dispositions are distinguished both from the actual behaviour to\nwhich they give rise—e.g., attracting iron filing or breaking in\nthe case of magnetism or fragility; some items are magnetic and others\nfragile without ever actually attracting iron filings or\nbreaking. Similarly, an organism can have a probabilistic disposition\nto have \\(n\\) offspring and yet “unluckily” never actually\nreproduce. \n\nDispositional concepts such as ‘magnetic’ have explanatory\npower even though they are defined in terms of causes and effects from\nwhich they are nevertheless distinct, and are realized by the\nmolecular properties of matter on which they supervene. The fact that\nfitness is a probabilistic disposition makes for no\nspecial difficulty on this analysis. The charge of tautology against\nthe theory thus rests on the mistaken demand that an explanatory\nvariable must always be defined in terms distinct from its causes and\neffects. This is a demand shown to be unreasonable by the failed\nLogical Positivists’ attempts to give the empirical meanings of\ntheoretical terms independent of their explanatory roles. \n\nMutatis mutandis the same will apply to comparative fitness\ndifferences. These will be dispositions supervening on the complex of\nrelations between organisms’ and environments’ manifest\nproperties (Rosenberg 1978), and will give rise to differential\nreproductive rates. Thus, definitions such as the following were\nadvanced by proponents of this approach (Beatty and Mills 1979,\nBrandon 1978): \n\nOf course, if fitness is a probabilistic propensity, then the fitter\namong competing organisms will not always leave more offspring, and\nthe theory of natural selection will have to be understood as making\nthe claim that (probabilistic) fitness differences result in\nreproductive differences not invariably but only with some\nprobability. With the inclusion of such propensities, the tautological\nnature of the explanation is dissolved since there is no deterministic\npath between the propensity to leave more offspring and the actual\nreproductive rates. But putting aside the tautology issue, there is\nalso a scientific reason for favoring propensity approaches: since the\ntheory of natural selection allows for drift, this qualification on\nits claims will be a welcome one. \n\nThe question arises however of what sort of a probabilistic propensity\nthe definition invokes. One candidate that has not found much favour\namong philosophers is that the probability invoked by the definition\nis long run relative frequency. To begin with owing to periods of\nenvironmental and genetic instability actual frequencies may vary\nrapidly while still approaching their long run relative frequencies\n(conditional on the counterfactual assumption that environment and\ngenes had been stable). This makes it difficult to confirm measures of\nfitness so defined. Moreover, treating single case probabilities as\nlong run relative frequencies is a long-standing objection. In the\nbiological case it is particularly serious owing to the role of small\nnumbers (e.g., founder effects) in evolution. Finally, if long run\nrelative frequencies reflect dispositions of organisms or populations\nto leave descendants, the question arises whether these dispositions\nare grounded on some occurrent properties or not. If not then long run\nrelative frequencies turn out to be or immediately give way to\nobjective chances. (See Earman 1985, 149.) \n\nSome philosophers have argued that fitnesses are precisely such\nobjective chances. Brandon and Carson (1996) held that here, as in\nquantum mechanics, we find a brute unanalyzable probabilistic\ndispositional property of a particular item, which generates the long\nrun relative frequencies. It is indeed the case that among\nphilosophers of quantum mechanics some hold that probabilistic\npropensities can explain actual frequencies [cf. Railton 1978, 216],\nand some hold that they do so via a detour into long run relative\nfrequencies. But few are comfortable with such arguments and adopt\nthem only because, at the level of the quantum mechanical\nprobabilistic propensities are indispensable and irreducible\n[cf. Lewis, 1984]. Proponents of probabilistic propensities in biology\nmay envision two possibilities here. One is that probabilistic\npropensities at the levels of phenomena that constitute the biological\nare the result of quantum probabilities “percolating up”\nin Sober (1984) and Brandon’s and Carson’s (1996) phrase; the second\nis that there are brute unexplainable probabilistic propensities at\nthe level of fitness differences (Brandon and Carson 1996). No one\ndoubts the potential biological significance of quantum\npercolation. It may well be an important source of mutation\n[cf. Stamos 1999 for a discussion]. But the claim that it has\na significant role in most fitness differences is\nnot supported by any independent evidence [cf. Millstein 2000 and\nGlymour 2001 for a discussion]. The claim that there are brute\nprobabilistic propensities at the level of organismal fitness\ndifferences is only slightly more tenable. No one has adduced any\nevidence that, for instance, the probabilistic generalizations about\nthe behaviour of animals that ethology and behavioural biology\nprovide, are irreducibly probabilistic, instead of simply expressions\nof the current state of our knowledge and ignorance of the causes and\nconditions of the behaviour in question. \n\nRosenberg and Kaplan [2005] advance an alternative account of the\nnature and source of objective chances in Darwinian processes, arguing\nthat they are not quantum mechanical in origin but are identical to\nthe objective chances that operate in the processes described by the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. Of course this suggestion trades one\nproblem for another, since the source of thermodynamic chances is a\nvexed question in the philosophy of physics. \n\nThere is however a much more serious issue facing the propensity\ndefinition of fitness: it has long been held to be difficult to pin\ndown the specific mathematical expression of the probabilistic\npropensity that is supposed to constitute fitness altogether. The\ndifficulty reflects features of natural selection that we must\naccommodate. Failure to deal with these difficulties leads inexorably\nto the conclusion that far from providing the theoretical meaning of\nfitness, the probabilistic propensity “definition” is a\nset of an indefinitely large number of\noperational measures of fitness; moreover,\nidentifying these measures often turns on assuming as understood just\nwhat the theory of natural selection sets out to explain. And if this\nis so, the probabilistic propensity definition will not defuse the\nthreat of triviality facing the theory of natural selection. We review\nhere the research program of delivering a propensity definition of\nfitness that has sought to deal with these difficulties.  \n\nThe first thing to notice about the “definition” \n\nis that it is of course often falsified. That is, there are many\ncircumstances in which the organism of greater fitness has the\npropensity to leave fewer immediate offspring than the organism of\nlower fitness; as when for example, the larger number of a bird’s\nchick all die owing to the equal division of a quantity of food which\nwould have kept a smaller number viable. More generally, as Gillespie\n(1977) has shown, the temporal and/or spatial variance in number of\noffspring may also have an important selective effect. Take a simple\nexample from Brandon (1990). If organism \\(a\\) has 2 offspring\neach year, and organism \\(b\\) has 1 offspring in odd numbered\nyears and 3 in even numbered ones, then, ceteris paribus,\nafter ten generations there will be 512 descendants of \\(a\\) and\n243 descendants of \\(b\\). The same holds if \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) are populations, and \\(b\\)’s offspring vary between 1\nand 3 depending on location instead of period.  \n\nAccordingly, we need to change the “definition” to\naccommodate the effects of variance: \n\nIt is also the case that in some biologically actual\ncircumstances—for example, in circumstances in which mean\nfitnesses are low, increased variance is sometimes selected for\n(Ekbohm, Fagerstrom, and Agren 1979). As Beatty and Finsen (1987)\nfurther showed, our “definition” will also have to\naccommodate “skew” along with offspring numbers and\nvariance. Skew “appears” when one of the\n“tails” of the distribution contains more observations and\nthe median is therefore shifted away from the normal. Our\n“definition” of fitness must take these conditions into\naccount on pain of falsity. One simple way to do so is to add a\nceteris paribus clause to the definition. But the question\nmust then be raised of how many different exceptions to the original\ndefiniens need to be accommodated.  If the circumstances\nunder which greater offspring numbers do not make for greater fitness\nare indefinitely many, then this “definition” will be\nunsatisfactory.  \n\nSome proponents of the propensity definition recognize this difficulty\nand are prepared to accept that at most a “schematic”\ndefinition can be provided. Thus Brandon writes (1990, 20):  \n\nHere \\(Q_i^{OE}\\) are a range of possible offspring numbers in\ngeneration \\(i\\), \\(P(Q_i^{OE})\\) is the probabilistic propensity to\nleave \\(Q_i^{OE}\\) in generation \\(i\\), and most important \\(f(E,\n\\sigma^2)\\) is “some function of the variance in offspring\nnumbers for a given type, \\(\\sigma^2\\), and of the pattern of\nvariation” (1990, 20). Brandon means “some function or\nother, we know not what in advance of examining the case.”\nMoreover, we will have to add to variance other factors that determine\nthe function, such as Beatty and Finsen’s skew, or the\nconditions which Ekbohm, Fagerstrom, and Agren identify as making\nhigher variance adaptive, etc. Thus, the final term in Brandon’s\ndefinition will have to be expanded to \\(f(E,\\sigma^2,\\ldots)\\), where\nthe ellipsis indicate the additional statistical factors which\nsometimes combine with or cancel the variance to determine fitness\nlevels. \n\nBut how many such factors are there, and when do they play a non-zero\nrole in fitness? The answer is that the number of such factors is\nprobably indefinitely large. The reason for this is given by the facts\nabout natural selection as Darwin and his successors uncovered\nthem. The fact about selection which fates our\n“definition” either to being forever schematic or\nincomplete is the “arms-race” strategic character of\nevolutionary interaction. Since every strategy for enhancing\nreproductive fitness (including how many offspring to have in a given\nenvironment) calls forth a counter-strategy among competing organisms\n(which may undercut the initial reproductive strategy), the number of\nconditions covered by our ceteris paribus clause, or\nequivalently the number of places in the function\n\\(f(E,\\sigma^2,\\ldots)\\) is equal to the number of strategies and\ncounter-strategies of reproduction available in an\nenvironment. Brandon writes, “in the above definition of\n\\(A^*(O,E)\\), the function \\(f(E,\\sigma^2)\\) is a dummy function in\nthe sense that the form can be specified only after the details of the\nselection scenario have been specified” (20). But, besides the\nfact Brandon admits, that the function \\(f\\) will differ for different\n\\(O\\) and \\(E\\), \\(f\\) will have to be expanded to accommodate an\nindefinite number of further statistical terms beyond\nvariance. Schematically, it will take the form\n\\(f(E,\\sigma^2,\\ldots)\\). Again, adapting Brandon’s notation,\nnone of the members of the set which express his multiply generic\n“definition” of “adaptedness” or\n“expected fitness”, \n\\(\\{\\Sigma P(Q_i^{OE})Q_i^{OE} - f_1(E,\\sigma^2, \\ldots)\\), \n\\(\\Sigma P(Q_i^{OE})Q_i^{OE} - f_2(E,\\sigma^2, \\ldots)\\), \n\\(\\Sigma P(Q_i^{OE})Q_i^{OE} - f_3(E,\\sigma^2, \\ldots)\\), \n\\(\\ldots\\}\\),  \nis in fact a definition of either term. It is the set of operational\nmeasurements of the property of comparative fitness.  \n\nPhilosophers dissatisfied with this conclusion have continued to\nsearch for a propensity definition of fitness that is\ncounterexample-free and not schematic or generic in Brandon’s\nsense. A promising candidate is due to Pence and Ramsey (2013). A\nbrief account is given here.  \n\nConsider all the possible daughter lineages or lines of descent from\nsome individual, \\(o\\). Call each of the possible lineages \\(\\omega\\)\nand the set of them \\(\\Omega\\). For each lineage \\(\\omega_i\\) the\nprobability that \\(o\\)’s actual daughter population is\n\\(\\omega_i\\) will be \\(Pr(\\omega_i)\\). \\(F\\), the fitness of \\(o\\),\nwill not be given by weighted sums of possible daughter populations at\na specific generation in the future, but rather by this value over the\nlong run, as the number of generations increases without limit.  The\ndefinition of individual fitness, \\(F\\), is then given by the\nfollowing equation (Pence and Ramsey 2013, 862; equation (4)):\n \n\n(where \\(\\phi(\\omega ,t)\\) is a function that gives the size of a\ndaughter population at some future time \\(t\\)).  Of course if every\npossible daughter lineage becomes extinct eventually then in the limit\n\\(F = 0\\), and if some populations fluctuate wildly, \\(F\\) may not\nconverge to a stable value in the limit either. But there are\nconditions under which the limit as the number of generations goes to\ninfinity is guaranteed to exist and under which \\(F\\) is well-defined\n(see Pence and Ramsey 2013, 862). \n\nThis equation is also subject to some further conditions Pence and Ramsey\nargue are biologically reasonable, for example that selection is\ndensity dependent, that there is an extinction threshold of some\npopulation size below which extinction obtains, and most important\nthat the population dynamics are non-chaotic. Pence and Ramsey show\nhow their definition avoids all of the problems discussed above, as\nwell as some other counterexamples to previous proposals, owing to its\nincorporating and combining all possible daughter populations over\nindefinitely many reproductive generations. They also show that a\ngeneral version of the same equation has been independently derived by\nmathematical biologists, and they argue that so defined, fitness has a\nsubstantial role to play in biology, especially the field of\n“adaptive dynamics”. They show how standard operation\nfitness measures biologists employ can be derived from the definition,\nincluding the simple geometric and arithmetic means, along with their\nhigher moments (variance, skew, etc.) when multi-generational effects\nare present. Thus, for example, Pence and Ramsey’s proposal has\nthe result that an organism with a probability of reproducing one\noffspring per generation equal to 1 will be fitter than an organism\nwith a .5 probability of 0 offspring and a .5 probability of 2\noffspring, since the second organism’s possible lines of descent\nwill all have a probability of extinction that approaches 1 as time\napproaches infinity.  \n\nSuppose that the Pence and Ramsey proposal adequately deals with the\ncounter-example problems that confronted earlier probabilistic\npropensity definitions of fitness. The question of whether this\ndefinition is adequate for trait fitness as well as for individual\nfitness and fitness differences remains. To begin with there is matter\nof whether the definition merely provides units in which to measure\nfitness the way that plainly operational definitions do, by contrast\nwith definitions of dispositions in terms of their occurrent\nbases. The supervenience of fitness on a vast and heterogeneous base\nmakes such a reductive definition impossible and as we have seen the\necological characterization in terms of “design problems”\nhas its limits as well. Moreover, some have argued that the propensity\ndefinition is at most only a component of the meaning of trait\nfitness. As noted above, some philosophers (e.g., Ariew and Ernst\n(2007, 296)) argue that trait fitness is often a matter of population\nsize and structure and conditions of genetic heritability, and these\nfactors are “extrinsic to the causal properties of the\nindividual” in its local environment. From this conclusion it\nseems an easy matter to infer that as it functions in the theory of\nnatural selection, trait fitness may not be causal force at all. It\nmay, after all, be a “book-keeping” notion, one which\nallows us to make predictive inferences without having any\n“biological reality”. \n\nThe Pence-Ramsey proposal holds out the prospect of dealing with a\nserious difficulty that long daunted the probabilistic propensity\ndefinition of fitness. For the counterexamples it deals with made\nimpossible any attempt to turn a generic probabilistic schema for\nfitness into a complete general definition that is both applicable and\nadequate to the task of vindicating the truth of the principle of\nnatural selection (PNS): \n\nNote that if we cannot give anything more than a generic schema for\n‘\\(x\\) is fitter than \\(y\\)’, then the PNS cannot be\nexpressed as a synthetic proposition with a truth-value and so cannot\nfigure as a general law. These problems had suggested to some\nphilosophers that we need to rethink the cognitive status of the\ntheory of natural selection altogether.  \n\nBrandon, for example, has argued that the theory of natural selection\nshould not be viewed as a body of general laws, but as the\nprescription for a research program. As such its central claims need\nnot meet standards of testability, and fitness need not be defined in\nterms that assure the nontriviality, testability, and direct\nexplanatory power of the theory of natural selection. In that sense,\nBrandon makes common cause with the later Popper. Popper originally\nargued the claim that the theory of natural selection was\nunfalsifiable pseudoscience. Later he came to hold that theory of\nnatural selection was a scientifically respectable but nevertheless\nuntestable organizing principle for biological science (Brandon 1990,\n139–140). \n\nOn this view, in each particular selective scenario a different\nspecification of the schematic propensity definition of fitness\nfigures in the antecedent of a different and highly restricted\nprinciple of natural selection that is applicable only in that\nscenario. Properly restricted to the right function and the right set\nof statistical features of its reproductive rate for a given\nenvironment, this version will be a highly specific claim about\nnatural selection for the given population in the given\nenvironment. \n\nThe notion that there is a very large family of principles of natural\nselection, each with a restricted range of application, will be\nattractive to those biologists uncomfortable with a single principle\nor law of natural selection, and to those philosophers of science who\ntreat the theory of natural selection as a class of models. On the\n“semantic approach” to the theory of natural selection,\neach of the substitution instances of the schematic principle of\nnatural selection generated by a particular specification of the\npropensity definition of fitness is treated as a definition of a\ndifferent Darwinian system of population change over time. See Lloyd\n1994, Beatty 1981, and Thompson 1989 for exposition of this\nposition. The evolutionary biologist’s task is to identify which\ndefinition is instantiated by a population in an environment.  \n\nFor every such definition instantiated by a population, there is the\nsynthetic truth that the members of the population, or all of its\nsubpopulations, instantiate the definition, and the further broader\ntruth that many populations of otherwise diverse species instantiate a\nsmall sub-set of the models, and the yet broader truth that all\npopulations instantiate one of this set of really quite similar\nmodels. Presumably, all these statements of varying degrees of\ngenerality need explanation. Consequently, those who resist the\n“semantic interpretation” of theories argue that we might\nas well treat each as a substitution instance of the principle of\nnatural selection generated by a different probabilistic propensity\nmeasure of fitness as a distinct empirical generalization to begin\nwith instead of a model-theoretic definition. But, one will want to\nask, does this set of generalizations with similar antecedents and\nidentical consequents have something in common, which in turn explains\nand unifies them, or are they the fundamental principles of the theory\nof natural selection? The question is obviously rhetorical. For each\nof the members of the set of functions that turn the definition-schema\nfor fitness into a complete property is a measurement of the fitness\nof some actual or potential individuals or populations. Each is a\nmeasurement appropriate to its particular environmental circumstances,\na measurement inappropriate for the same or different individuals at\ndifferent locations or times in the same environment. \n\nOne alternative is to allow that the PNS is a necessary truth but\ncontinue to hold that it has explanatory content, and can figure in\ncausal explanations of evolutionary outcomes. This is a view advanced\nby Sober (see Sober 2002) and examined in Lange and Rosenberg\n(2011). As we shall see in the next section, another possibility is to\nrelativize reproductive rates in favor of another universal measure of\nfitness.  \n\nIn previous sections, we remarked on the difficulty of identifying the\nprecise propensity that could, according to some, ground fitness\nascriptions. Moreover, it is often difficult to isolate the\npopulations where the evolutionary change is occurring. This is in\npart an operational problem, but for many biological systems, this\ndifficulty may in fact reveal a deeper ontological issue. Thinking\nabout fitness in reproductive terms depends on the possibility of\nidentifying offspring (or successive replicators) and populations of\nthem. For most Metazoans, this appears to be relatively\nstraightforward. But how are we to treat the evolution of colonies,\nclonal organisms and symbionts (and hypothetically ecosystems)? Many\nphilosophers have argued that our philosophy of biology’s usual\nbestiary does not reflect some of the complex organisation actually to\nbe found in nature (J. Wilson 1999, D.S. Wilson and Sober 1989,\nGodfrey-Smith 2009, O’Malley and Dupré 2007, Bouchard and\nHuneman 2013) For many biological systems, organismal boundaries seem\narbitrary ways to carve up the biological world. Those boundaries may\nmerely reflect an impoverished way of thinking about biological\nindividuality (Pradeu 2012, Haber 2013). Many biological individuals\nare in fact complex arrangements of other individuals. When these\nindividuals belong to a single species (ex. some eusocial insects) a\ngene selectionist view according to which fitness is understood as the\ndifferential reproductive success of alleles may be available. But in\nthe case of multi-species communities (e.g., fungus-termite colonies),\nallelic success will not track evolutionary change since some of the\nadaptations are not fully biotic (Bouchard 2009). Moreover, it has\nbeen argued (Turner 2004, Bouchard 2004, 2008) that some individuals\nthat are adapting are not reproducing at all.  \n\nBiological individuality is much more varied and heterogeneous than\npreviously believed and this additional complexity puts pressure on\nthe notion that reproductive success can act as a ‘universal\ncurrency’ of fitness. The difficulties of establishing\nreproductive success for some clonal organisms, for collectives of\norganisms and for multi-species assemblages has led some biologists\nand philosophers to entertain alternative concepts of fitness. Leigh\nVan Valen, in his attempts to develop a theory of evolution that would\nallow for the evolution of whole communities (Van Valen 1975, 1989,\n1991), suggested that fitness as energy control could explain the\nevolution of a broader range of biological systems. “Rather than\nsaying that natural selection is expected differential reproduction,\nwe should say that it is expected differential expansion” (Van\nValen 1989, 7). By ‘expansion’ Van Valen doesn’t\nmean expansion in physical space (although that may occur) but\nexpansion in resource or energy space. In this approach, energy is\nseen as the ‘universal currency’: a fitter community is\none that controls more energy than another community. For\n‘simpler’ biological systems such as sexual species with\ndiscrete generations, increased reproductive success is a good proxy\nfor increased energy success and therefore previous measurements and\nmodels of reproductive output remain useful but their explanatory\nexhaustiveness is relativized. Although energy can seem to be a\nuniversal measure of fitness that could apply to the all the varied\ntypes of biological individuals that can emerge, it’s not clear\nthat Van Valen’s approach can be as universal as desired since\nit has difficulty explaining increases in efficiency in energy control\n(see Bouchard 2004 chap 3 for analysis). This has motivated Bouchard\n(2004, 2008, 2011) to argue for an account of evolution focusing on\ndifferential persistence (reminiscent of Thoday 1953). Bouchard (2004,\n2008, 2011) argues that Persistence Through Time of a lineage is the\nproperty maximized by evolution by natural selection: maximization of\nrelative reproductive success or maximization of energy control are\nonly two dominant strategies for persistence increase (see Bourrat\n2014 and Doolittle 2014 for related approaches). In this approach\n(lineage) \\(X\\)is fitter than (lineage) \\(Y\\) if \\(X\\)has a higher\npropensity to persist for \\(Z\\) amount of time than \\(Y\\). Some of the\nproblems of propensities remain, but we gain a way to assess\necological fitness (probability of persistence) in a way that can be\nindependent of reproductive success. Persistence is the overarching\ndesign-problem. Increased reproductive potential is but one powerful\nway to increase one’s potential to persist.  \n\nThe question of how to define biological individuality is an\nontological question about what individuals can evolve in response to\nnatural selection. Many biological systems differ in form and in\nfunction from our garden variety Metazoans. How are we to understand\nthe evolution of symbiotic communities involving bacteria with lateral\ngene transfer? How are we to make sense of the complex traits of\neusocial insects? Not all these emergent individuals qua individuals\nreplicate. Whether it’s by focusing on energy or persistence (or\nsome other account) a complete understanding of fitness should reflect\nthat fact—or accept that it cannot alone account for some\nadaptive change in the biological world.  \n\nThe difficulties that face both the subjective probability view of\nfitness and the probabilistic propensity definitions of fitness are\nserious enough to make the notion of “ecological fitness”\nworth revisiting. Recall that on this view ‘\\(a\\) is fitter than\n\\(b\\) in \\(E\\)’ is defined as ‘\\(a\\)’s traits result\nin its solving the design problems set by \\(E\\) more fully than\n\\(b\\)’s traits.’ The terms in which this definition is\ncouched are certainly in as much need of clarification as is\n‘fitness’. It is cold philosophical comfort to point out\nthat definitions have to stop somewhere, that the definition of a\ntheoretical term must be distinct from the operational measure of the\nproperty it names, and that testability is not a matter of theory\nmeeting data one proposition at a time. In consequence none of these\nconsiderations have convinced philosophers of biology to accept the\ndesign problem definition, and to give up the project of defining\nfitness by reference to its effects in reproduction. Nevertheless,\nthere does appear to be important biological work that the ecological\nfitness concept can do, and which no definition of fitness in terms of\ndifferential reproductive rates—actual, expected, or\ndispositional—can do. \n\nTo see what these tasks are, consider the question, How do we decide\nwhether a divergence from a long run relative frequency prediction\nabout fitness differences is a matter of drift, a disconfirmation of\nthe hypothesis of natural selection, or a reflection of a\nmismeasurement of fitness differences to begin with? Suppose we\nmeasure the fitness differences between population \\(a\\) and\npopulation \\(b\\) to be in the ratio of 7:3 (e.g., \\(w_a = 1\\), \\(w_b =\n.428\\)) and suppose further that in some generation, the actual\noffspring ratio is 5:5. There are four alternatives: (a) the fitness\nmeasure of 7:3 is right but there was drift—i.e., the initial\nconditions at this generation are unrepresentative of those which\nobtain in all relevant generations; (b) the fitness measure of 7:3 was\nincorrect and there was no drift; (c) both drift and wrong fitness\nmeasure or (d) the principle of natural selection is\ndisconfirmed. Ignoring the fourth alternative, how do we discriminate\namong the first three of these? \n\nIn the absence of information about the initial conditions of the\ndivergence, there is only one way empirically to choose between\nalternatives (a)–(c). This way requires that there are\necological fitness differences, and that we can detect them. Suppose\nthat fitness differences were matters of probabilistic differential\nreproductive success (no matter what interpretation of probability is\nadopted). Then the only access to fitness differences is via\npopulation censuses in previous generations (since these form the\nbases of the probabilities). Suppose that this census does indeed show\na 7:3 ratio between as and bs in the recent past. In order to exclude\nthe absence of fitness differences instead of drift, as the source of\nthe current generation’s 5:5 outcome, we need to be able to\nestablish that the 7:3 differences in previous populations were not\nthemselves the result of drift. But this is the first step in a\nregress, since we began with the problem of discriminating drift from\nmismeasures of fitness. To solve the initial problem, we now have to\nassure ourselves that the 7:3 ratios in the past were not the result\nof drift. Whence the regress. Of course the problem does not arise\nif we have access to fitness differences independently of previous\npopulation censuses. And this access we have, at least in\nprinciple, if fitness is a matter of differences in the solution of\nidentifiable design problems, that is, if there is such a thing as\necological fitness and it is (fallibly) measured by probabilistic\npropensities to leave offspring. \n\nOnce we have access to ecological fitness differences, we can, at\nleast in principle, decide whether the divergence from predicted\nlong-run relative frequencies, especially where small populations are\nconcerned, is a matter of drift or reflects our ignorance either of\necological fitness differences or the unrepresentativeness of the\ninitial conditions of individual births, deaths, and\nreproductions. \n\nThis result also has important implications for the interpretation of\nthe theory of natural selection as one wholly about populations, and\nnot also about individual fitness differences, discussed above\n(individual versus trait fitness). Note that the problem of\ndistinguishing drift from selection in ensembles—i.e., large\npopulations—has the same character, and is in principle\nsusceptible to the same solution as the problem of drift makes for\nevolution among lineages with small numbers of individual members. We\ncan distinguish drift from selection in ensembles as well, if\nwe accept that there is such epistemic access to ecological fitness\ndifferences and to the initial conditions of births, deaths and\nreproductions, taken one at a time, and we accept that these\nindividual-differences aggregate into ensemble-differences. \n\nBecause populations no matter how large are always finite in size,\nthere is always some drift which needs to be distinguished from\nfitness differences. Thus even in population biology there is in the\nend no substitute for ecological fitness and no way to dispense with\nits services to the theory of natural selection. And since ecological\nfitness is ultimately a relationship between organisms (or\nindividuals) taken two at a time, the theory is as much a set of\nclaims about individuals as it is about populations. \n\nThis line of reasoning highlights the next phase of the debate. From a\ndiscussion about fitness, the debate has evolved into a general debate\nconcerning the nature of natural selection and drift. A number of\nalternative views have emerged in thinking about these topics. Some\n(e.g., Walsh, Lewens, Ariew, and Matthen) think about natural\nselection solely as population wide patterns caused by non selective\nprocesses: this view deprives fitness of any causal or explanatory\npower. Others (e.g., Millstein and Stephens) see fitness and natural\nselection as a cause, operating at the population level, to bring\nabout the differential reproduction rates. Finally others argue that,\nif it is to play an explanatory role in our theory, fitness has to be\nan individual and causal concept. As these debates suggest, far from\nbeing merely a 19th century slogan, understanding the\nmeaning of the “survival of the fittest” is of\nphilosophical and biological urgency.","contact.mail":"alexrose@duke.edu","contact.domain":"duke.edu"},{"date.published":"2002-12-09","date.changed":"2015-09-18","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fitness/","author1":"Alexander Rosenberg","author1.info":"http://www.duke.edu/~alexrose/","author2.info":"http://www.mapageweb.umontreal.ca/bouchaf/","entry":"fitness","body.text":"\n\n \n\nThe diversity, complexity, and adaptation of the biological realm\nis evident. Until Darwin, the best explanation for these three\nfeatures of the biological was the conclusion of the “argument\nfrom design.” Darwin’s theory of natural selection\nprovides an explanation of all three of these features of the\nbiological realm without adverting to some mysterious designing\nentity, by explaining the process of “the survival of the\nfittest.” But this explanation’s success turns on the\nmeaning of its central explanatory concept,\n‘fitness’. Moreover, since Darwinian theory provides the\nresources for a purely causal account of teleology, wherever it is\nmanifested, its reliance on the concept of ‘fitness’ makes\nit imperative that conceptual problems threatening the explanatory\nlegitimacy of this notion be solved.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe leading idea of Darwin’s theory of natural selection is\noften expressed in terms first coined by Herbert Spencer as the claim\nthat among competing organisms the fittest survive (1864, 144). If\nthere is random variation among the traits of organisms, and if some\nvariant traits fortuitously confer advantages on the organisms that\nbear them, i.e., enhance their fitness, then those organisms will live\nto have more offspring, which in turn will bear the advantageous\ntraits. Whence descent with adaptive modification, i.e.,\nevolution. Evolution by random heritable variation and natural\nselection will explain ever increasing adaptation to given\nenvironments, increasing diversity in the occupation of new\nenvironments, and the complexity of organisms and their parts as their\nlineages adapt to one another and to their environments. \n\nBut what is fitness and how can one tell when a trait enhances\nfitness, or more to the point, when one organism is fitter than\nanother? Opponents of the theory of natural selection have long\nclaimed that the theory is so treated by its proponents as to define\nfitness in terms of rates of reproduction, thus condemning the\nprinciple of the survival of the fittest to triviality: the claim that\nthose organisms with higher rates of reproduction leave more offspring\nis an empty, unfalsifiable tautology bereft of explanatory power. In\nthe century and a half since the publication of On the Origin of\nSpecies biologists have all too often reinforced this objection\nby actually so defining fitness. For example, C.H. Waddington writes,\nin Towards a Theoretical Biology (1968, 19), that the fittest\nindividuals are those that are “most effective in leaving\ngametes to the next generation.” It appears therefore that\nevolutionary theory requires a definition of fitness that will protect\nit from the charges of tautology, triviality, unfalsifiabilty, and\nconsequent explanatory infirmity. If no such definition is in fact\nforthcoming, then what is required by the theory’s adherents is\nan alternative account of its structure and content or its role in the\nresearch program of biology.  \n\nIn an intuitive sense, ‘fitness’ can refer to the\ncorrespondence between the shape of an object and an empty volume it is\nplaced in: a square peg fits into a square hole. In a more abstract\nfashion, one might refer to the properties of an entity and how they\ncorrespond to the constraints of its context. In a biological setting\none could focus on an organism’s traits and how they correspond\nto various aspects of the environment the organism is living\nin. Following biological usage, call this concept ‘ecological\nfitness’. (It has also been called ‘vernacular\nfitness,’ cf. Matthen and Ariew 2002.) The\n‘vernacular’ definition is fraught with\ndifficulties. Suppose, following Dennett (1995) we characterize the\nrelation ‘\\(x\\) is fitter than \\(y\\)’ as follows: \n\nOne may ask, What are these design problems? How many of them are\nthere? Is there any way of measuring the degree to which \\(x\\)\nexceeds \\(y\\) in their solution? Answers to these questions\nsimply reinforce the threat of tautology that faces the theory. To\nbegin with the notion of “design problems” is vague and\nmetaphorical; or, if treated literally, design problems will all be\nones relative to the overarching objective of leaving more\ndescendants. Thus the definition may simply hide the original problem\nof distinguishing fitness from reproductive rates, instead of solving\nit. \n\nSecond, the number of design problems is equal to the number of\ndistinct environmental features that affect survival, and of course\nreproduction, and this number is probably uncountable. Accordingly,\nprima facie, the proposed definition provides no hope of cardinal or\neven ordinal measurement that would enable us to predict or explain\nquantitatively differences in rates of reproduction, and the\nevolutionary processes that depend on these rates. Moreover,\necological fitness accounts may not have provided a satisfactory story\nabout how to carve up the relevant reference environment that is\nsupposed to have an impact on the survival of said organisms (Abrams\n2009). It is no wonder that biologists, sensible of the importance of\npredictive precision and explanatory testability, have had little\ntruck with ecological fitness and have defined ‘\\(x\\) is\nfitter than \\(y\\)’ in terms of quantitatively measurable\nreproductive rates. This tendency of course simply adds force to the\noriginal argument. If the only way to make fitness differences\nscientifically tractable is to trivialize the theory, so much the\nworse for the theory.  \n\nSome philosophers (notably Sober, 2013) have argued that\nevolutionary fitness is a property of populations and not of\nindividual organisms, or alternatively that fitness is a property of\ntraits and not of the individuals that possess them. Individual\nfitness values are, they argue, empirically inaccessible and\npredictively useless. If trait fitness is defined in terms of the\naverage fitness value of individuals bearing the trait, then it will\nturn out that there are individual fitnesses and individual fitness\ndifferences, even if it is the case that evolutionary\nbiologists’ interests are confined to trait fitnesses. This\nclaim has been challenged (cf. Pence and Ramsey 2014): sometimes\nbiologists estimate trait fitnesses by studying individual fitnesses\n(Endler 1986).  \n\nIt has also been held that trait fitness and fitness difference are\nboth something more than and different from the average of individual\nfitnesses and fitness differences. On this view trait fitness is a\nproperty of populations and in part of their population structure,\nthat is, the ways in which traits are distributed in the\npopulation. An example (to be explored further below) is reflected in\ncases where the fitness of a trait depends not just on its incidence\nin a population, but also on its variance within. A trait’s\nvariance in a population cannot be reflected in individual fitness\nany more than the entropy of a volume of gas can be reflected in the\nproperties of any of the individual molecules that compose it and\ncontribute to its entropy. This suggests that trait fitness is not\nreducible to, definable in terms of, or even entirely supervenient on\nthe relationship between individuals (e.g., organisms) and their\nenvironments.  \n\nThe disagreement about whether fitness is a property of biological\nindividuals (genes, genotypes, organisms, families, populations and\nother groups or even species) as opposed to a property of traits of\nthese individuals, has made significant another debate about the\nexplanatory role of fitness in the theory of natural selection. Among\nthose who endorse trait fitness (differences), and not individual\nfitness (differences), as a fundamental explanatory factor in natural\nselection, there is a dispute about whether its explanatory role\nreflects its causal force, or whether trait fitness is a purely\nstatistical concept employed in the theory of natural selection to\nmake demographic predictions about future trait distributions, without\nentering into any causal nexus among the objects so to speak. Thus,\nMatthen and Ariew (2002, 56) write, “Unlike vernacular\n[individual] fitness, predictive [trait] fitness is not a cause of\nselection, or of evolution for that matter…. [P]redictive\nfitness is a measure of evolutionary change not a cause.” This\nview confers an obligation on those who embrace it to explain how the\ntheory of natural selection can provide contingent explanations\nwithout trading in causal relations among its explanatory\nvariables.  \n\nAmong philosophers of biology there has been a wide consensus that\nthe solution to problem of defining individual ‘fitness’\nis given by treating it as a probabilistic disposition. As such it\ncausally intervenes between the relationship of environments to\norganisms that cause it, and the actual rates of reproduction that are\nits effects. Thus, fitness turns out to be a\n“garden-variety” dispositional concept like\n‘magnetic’ or ‘fragile’. These properties, and\nall dispositions are distinguished both from the actual behaviour to\nwhich they give rise—e.g., attracting iron filing or breaking in\nthe case of magnetism or fragility; some items are magnetic and others\nfragile without ever actually attracting iron filings or\nbreaking. Similarly, an organism can have a probabilistic disposition\nto have \\(n\\) offspring and yet “unluckily” never actually\nreproduce. \n\nDispositional concepts such as ‘magnetic’ have explanatory\npower even though they are defined in terms of causes and effects from\nwhich they are nevertheless distinct, and are realized by the\nmolecular properties of matter on which they supervene. The fact that\nfitness is a probabilistic disposition makes for no\nspecial difficulty on this analysis. The charge of tautology against\nthe theory thus rests on the mistaken demand that an explanatory\nvariable must always be defined in terms distinct from its causes and\neffects. This is a demand shown to be unreasonable by the failed\nLogical Positivists’ attempts to give the empirical meanings of\ntheoretical terms independent of their explanatory roles. \n\nMutatis mutandis the same will apply to comparative fitness\ndifferences. These will be dispositions supervening on the complex of\nrelations between organisms’ and environments’ manifest\nproperties (Rosenberg 1978), and will give rise to differential\nreproductive rates. Thus, definitions such as the following were\nadvanced by proponents of this approach (Beatty and Mills 1979,\nBrandon 1978): \n\nOf course, if fitness is a probabilistic propensity, then the fitter\namong competing organisms will not always leave more offspring, and\nthe theory of natural selection will have to be understood as making\nthe claim that (probabilistic) fitness differences result in\nreproductive differences not invariably but only with some\nprobability. With the inclusion of such propensities, the tautological\nnature of the explanation is dissolved since there is no deterministic\npath between the propensity to leave more offspring and the actual\nreproductive rates. But putting aside the tautology issue, there is\nalso a scientific reason for favoring propensity approaches: since the\ntheory of natural selection allows for drift, this qualification on\nits claims will be a welcome one. \n\nThe question arises however of what sort of a probabilistic propensity\nthe definition invokes. One candidate that has not found much favour\namong philosophers is that the probability invoked by the definition\nis long run relative frequency. To begin with owing to periods of\nenvironmental and genetic instability actual frequencies may vary\nrapidly while still approaching their long run relative frequencies\n(conditional on the counterfactual assumption that environment and\ngenes had been stable). This makes it difficult to confirm measures of\nfitness so defined. Moreover, treating single case probabilities as\nlong run relative frequencies is a long-standing objection. In the\nbiological case it is particularly serious owing to the role of small\nnumbers (e.g., founder effects) in evolution. Finally, if long run\nrelative frequencies reflect dispositions of organisms or populations\nto leave descendants, the question arises whether these dispositions\nare grounded on some occurrent properties or not. If not then long run\nrelative frequencies turn out to be or immediately give way to\nobjective chances. (See Earman 1985, 149.) \n\nSome philosophers have argued that fitnesses are precisely such\nobjective chances. Brandon and Carson (1996) held that here, as in\nquantum mechanics, we find a brute unanalyzable probabilistic\ndispositional property of a particular item, which generates the long\nrun relative frequencies. It is indeed the case that among\nphilosophers of quantum mechanics some hold that probabilistic\npropensities can explain actual frequencies [cf. Railton 1978, 216],\nand some hold that they do so via a detour into long run relative\nfrequencies. But few are comfortable with such arguments and adopt\nthem only because, at the level of the quantum mechanical\nprobabilistic propensities are indispensable and irreducible\n[cf. Lewis, 1984]. Proponents of probabilistic propensities in biology\nmay envision two possibilities here. One is that probabilistic\npropensities at the levels of phenomena that constitute the biological\nare the result of quantum probabilities “percolating up”\nin Sober (1984) and Brandon’s and Carson’s (1996) phrase; the second\nis that there are brute unexplainable probabilistic propensities at\nthe level of fitness differences (Brandon and Carson 1996). No one\ndoubts the potential biological significance of quantum\npercolation. It may well be an important source of mutation\n[cf. Stamos 1999 for a discussion]. But the claim that it has\na significant role in most fitness differences is\nnot supported by any independent evidence [cf. Millstein 2000 and\nGlymour 2001 for a discussion]. The claim that there are brute\nprobabilistic propensities at the level of organismal fitness\ndifferences is only slightly more tenable. No one has adduced any\nevidence that, for instance, the probabilistic generalizations about\nthe behaviour of animals that ethology and behavioural biology\nprovide, are irreducibly probabilistic, instead of simply expressions\nof the current state of our knowledge and ignorance of the causes and\nconditions of the behaviour in question. \n\nRosenberg and Kaplan [2005] advance an alternative account of the\nnature and source of objective chances in Darwinian processes, arguing\nthat they are not quantum mechanical in origin but are identical to\nthe objective chances that operate in the processes described by the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. Of course this suggestion trades one\nproblem for another, since the source of thermodynamic chances is a\nvexed question in the philosophy of physics. \n\nThere is however a much more serious issue facing the propensity\ndefinition of fitness: it has long been held to be difficult to pin\ndown the specific mathematical expression of the probabilistic\npropensity that is supposed to constitute fitness altogether. The\ndifficulty reflects features of natural selection that we must\naccommodate. Failure to deal with these difficulties leads inexorably\nto the conclusion that far from providing the theoretical meaning of\nfitness, the probabilistic propensity “definition” is a\nset of an indefinitely large number of\noperational measures of fitness; moreover,\nidentifying these measures often turns on assuming as understood just\nwhat the theory of natural selection sets out to explain. And if this\nis so, the probabilistic propensity definition will not defuse the\nthreat of triviality facing the theory of natural selection. We review\nhere the research program of delivering a propensity definition of\nfitness that has sought to deal with these difficulties.  \n\nThe first thing to notice about the “definition” \n\nis that it is of course often falsified. That is, there are many\ncircumstances in which the organism of greater fitness has the\npropensity to leave fewer immediate offspring than the organism of\nlower fitness; as when for example, the larger number of a bird’s\nchick all die owing to the equal division of a quantity of food which\nwould have kept a smaller number viable. More generally, as Gillespie\n(1977) has shown, the temporal and/or spatial variance in number of\noffspring may also have an important selective effect. Take a simple\nexample from Brandon (1990). If organism \\(a\\) has 2 offspring\neach year, and organism \\(b\\) has 1 offspring in odd numbered\nyears and 3 in even numbered ones, then, ceteris paribus,\nafter ten generations there will be 512 descendants of \\(a\\) and\n243 descendants of \\(b\\). The same holds if \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) are populations, and \\(b\\)’s offspring vary between 1\nand 3 depending on location instead of period.  \n\nAccordingly, we need to change the “definition” to\naccommodate the effects of variance: \n\nIt is also the case that in some biologically actual\ncircumstances—for example, in circumstances in which mean\nfitnesses are low, increased variance is sometimes selected for\n(Ekbohm, Fagerstrom, and Agren 1979). As Beatty and Finsen (1987)\nfurther showed, our “definition” will also have to\naccommodate “skew” along with offspring numbers and\nvariance. Skew “appears” when one of the\n“tails” of the distribution contains more observations and\nthe median is therefore shifted away from the normal. Our\n“definition” of fitness must take these conditions into\naccount on pain of falsity. One simple way to do so is to add a\nceteris paribus clause to the definition. But the question\nmust then be raised of how many different exceptions to the original\ndefiniens need to be accommodated.  If the circumstances\nunder which greater offspring numbers do not make for greater fitness\nare indefinitely many, then this “definition” will be\nunsatisfactory.  \n\nSome proponents of the propensity definition recognize this difficulty\nand are prepared to accept that at most a “schematic”\ndefinition can be provided. Thus Brandon writes (1990, 20):  \n\nHere \\(Q_i^{OE}\\) are a range of possible offspring numbers in\ngeneration \\(i\\), \\(P(Q_i^{OE})\\) is the probabilistic propensity to\nleave \\(Q_i^{OE}\\) in generation \\(i\\), and most important \\(f(E,\n\\sigma^2)\\) is “some function of the variance in offspring\nnumbers for a given type, \\(\\sigma^2\\), and of the pattern of\nvariation” (1990, 20). Brandon means “some function or\nother, we know not what in advance of examining the case.”\nMoreover, we will have to add to variance other factors that determine\nthe function, such as Beatty and Finsen’s skew, or the\nconditions which Ekbohm, Fagerstrom, and Agren identify as making\nhigher variance adaptive, etc. Thus, the final term in Brandon’s\ndefinition will have to be expanded to \\(f(E,\\sigma^2,\\ldots)\\), where\nthe ellipsis indicate the additional statistical factors which\nsometimes combine with or cancel the variance to determine fitness\nlevels. \n\nBut how many such factors are there, and when do they play a non-zero\nrole in fitness? The answer is that the number of such factors is\nprobably indefinitely large. The reason for this is given by the facts\nabout natural selection as Darwin and his successors uncovered\nthem. The fact about selection which fates our\n“definition” either to being forever schematic or\nincomplete is the “arms-race” strategic character of\nevolutionary interaction. Since every strategy for enhancing\nreproductive fitness (including how many offspring to have in a given\nenvironment) calls forth a counter-strategy among competing organisms\n(which may undercut the initial reproductive strategy), the number of\nconditions covered by our ceteris paribus clause, or\nequivalently the number of places in the function\n\\(f(E,\\sigma^2,\\ldots)\\) is equal to the number of strategies and\ncounter-strategies of reproduction available in an\nenvironment. Brandon writes, “in the above definition of\n\\(A^*(O,E)\\), the function \\(f(E,\\sigma^2)\\) is a dummy function in\nthe sense that the form can be specified only after the details of the\nselection scenario have been specified” (20). But, besides the\nfact Brandon admits, that the function \\(f\\) will differ for different\n\\(O\\) and \\(E\\), \\(f\\) will have to be expanded to accommodate an\nindefinite number of further statistical terms beyond\nvariance. Schematically, it will take the form\n\\(f(E,\\sigma^2,\\ldots)\\). Again, adapting Brandon’s notation,\nnone of the members of the set which express his multiply generic\n“definition” of “adaptedness” or\n“expected fitness”, \n\\(\\{\\Sigma P(Q_i^{OE})Q_i^{OE} - f_1(E,\\sigma^2, \\ldots)\\), \n\\(\\Sigma P(Q_i^{OE})Q_i^{OE} - f_2(E,\\sigma^2, \\ldots)\\), \n\\(\\Sigma P(Q_i^{OE})Q_i^{OE} - f_3(E,\\sigma^2, \\ldots)\\), \n\\(\\ldots\\}\\),  \nis in fact a definition of either term. It is the set of operational\nmeasurements of the property of comparative fitness.  \n\nPhilosophers dissatisfied with this conclusion have continued to\nsearch for a propensity definition of fitness that is\ncounterexample-free and not schematic or generic in Brandon’s\nsense. A promising candidate is due to Pence and Ramsey (2013). A\nbrief account is given here.  \n\nConsider all the possible daughter lineages or lines of descent from\nsome individual, \\(o\\). Call each of the possible lineages \\(\\omega\\)\nand the set of them \\(\\Omega\\). For each lineage \\(\\omega_i\\) the\nprobability that \\(o\\)’s actual daughter population is\n\\(\\omega_i\\) will be \\(Pr(\\omega_i)\\). \\(F\\), the fitness of \\(o\\),\nwill not be given by weighted sums of possible daughter populations at\na specific generation in the future, but rather by this value over the\nlong run, as the number of generations increases without limit.  The\ndefinition of individual fitness, \\(F\\), is then given by the\nfollowing equation (Pence and Ramsey 2013, 862; equation (4)):\n \n\n(where \\(\\phi(\\omega ,t)\\) is a function that gives the size of a\ndaughter population at some future time \\(t\\)).  Of course if every\npossible daughter lineage becomes extinct eventually then in the limit\n\\(F = 0\\), and if some populations fluctuate wildly, \\(F\\) may not\nconverge to a stable value in the limit either. But there are\nconditions under which the limit as the number of generations goes to\ninfinity is guaranteed to exist and under which \\(F\\) is well-defined\n(see Pence and Ramsey 2013, 862). \n\nThis equation is also subject to some further conditions Pence and Ramsey\nargue are biologically reasonable, for example that selection is\ndensity dependent, that there is an extinction threshold of some\npopulation size below which extinction obtains, and most important\nthat the population dynamics are non-chaotic. Pence and Ramsey show\nhow their definition avoids all of the problems discussed above, as\nwell as some other counterexamples to previous proposals, owing to its\nincorporating and combining all possible daughter populations over\nindefinitely many reproductive generations. They also show that a\ngeneral version of the same equation has been independently derived by\nmathematical biologists, and they argue that so defined, fitness has a\nsubstantial role to play in biology, especially the field of\n“adaptive dynamics”. They show how standard operation\nfitness measures biologists employ can be derived from the definition,\nincluding the simple geometric and arithmetic means, along with their\nhigher moments (variance, skew, etc.) when multi-generational effects\nare present. Thus, for example, Pence and Ramsey’s proposal has\nthe result that an organism with a probability of reproducing one\noffspring per generation equal to 1 will be fitter than an organism\nwith a .5 probability of 0 offspring and a .5 probability of 2\noffspring, since the second organism’s possible lines of descent\nwill all have a probability of extinction that approaches 1 as time\napproaches infinity.  \n\nSuppose that the Pence and Ramsey proposal adequately deals with the\ncounter-example problems that confronted earlier probabilistic\npropensity definitions of fitness. The question of whether this\ndefinition is adequate for trait fitness as well as for individual\nfitness and fitness differences remains. To begin with there is matter\nof whether the definition merely provides units in which to measure\nfitness the way that plainly operational definitions do, by contrast\nwith definitions of dispositions in terms of their occurrent\nbases. The supervenience of fitness on a vast and heterogeneous base\nmakes such a reductive definition impossible and as we have seen the\necological characterization in terms of “design problems”\nhas its limits as well. Moreover, some have argued that the propensity\ndefinition is at most only a component of the meaning of trait\nfitness. As noted above, some philosophers (e.g., Ariew and Ernst\n(2007, 296)) argue that trait fitness is often a matter of population\nsize and structure and conditions of genetic heritability, and these\nfactors are “extrinsic to the causal properties of the\nindividual” in its local environment. From this conclusion it\nseems an easy matter to infer that as it functions in the theory of\nnatural selection, trait fitness may not be causal force at all. It\nmay, after all, be a “book-keeping” notion, one which\nallows us to make predictive inferences without having any\n“biological reality”. \n\nThe Pence-Ramsey proposal holds out the prospect of dealing with a\nserious difficulty that long daunted the probabilistic propensity\ndefinition of fitness. For the counterexamples it deals with made\nimpossible any attempt to turn a generic probabilistic schema for\nfitness into a complete general definition that is both applicable and\nadequate to the task of vindicating the truth of the principle of\nnatural selection (PNS): \n\nNote that if we cannot give anything more than a generic schema for\n‘\\(x\\) is fitter than \\(y\\)’, then the PNS cannot be\nexpressed as a synthetic proposition with a truth-value and so cannot\nfigure as a general law. These problems had suggested to some\nphilosophers that we need to rethink the cognitive status of the\ntheory of natural selection altogether.  \n\nBrandon, for example, has argued that the theory of natural selection\nshould not be viewed as a body of general laws, but as the\nprescription for a research program. As such its central claims need\nnot meet standards of testability, and fitness need not be defined in\nterms that assure the nontriviality, testability, and direct\nexplanatory power of the theory of natural selection. In that sense,\nBrandon makes common cause with the later Popper. Popper originally\nargued the claim that the theory of natural selection was\nunfalsifiable pseudoscience. Later he came to hold that theory of\nnatural selection was a scientifically respectable but nevertheless\nuntestable organizing principle for biological science (Brandon 1990,\n139–140). \n\nOn this view, in each particular selective scenario a different\nspecification of the schematic propensity definition of fitness\nfigures in the antecedent of a different and highly restricted\nprinciple of natural selection that is applicable only in that\nscenario. Properly restricted to the right function and the right set\nof statistical features of its reproductive rate for a given\nenvironment, this version will be a highly specific claim about\nnatural selection for the given population in the given\nenvironment. \n\nThe notion that there is a very large family of principles of natural\nselection, each with a restricted range of application, will be\nattractive to those biologists uncomfortable with a single principle\nor law of natural selection, and to those philosophers of science who\ntreat the theory of natural selection as a class of models. On the\n“semantic approach” to the theory of natural selection,\neach of the substitution instances of the schematic principle of\nnatural selection generated by a particular specification of the\npropensity definition of fitness is treated as a definition of a\ndifferent Darwinian system of population change over time. See Lloyd\n1994, Beatty 1981, and Thompson 1989 for exposition of this\nposition. The evolutionary biologist’s task is to identify which\ndefinition is instantiated by a population in an environment.  \n\nFor every such definition instantiated by a population, there is the\nsynthetic truth that the members of the population, or all of its\nsubpopulations, instantiate the definition, and the further broader\ntruth that many populations of otherwise diverse species instantiate a\nsmall sub-set of the models, and the yet broader truth that all\npopulations instantiate one of this set of really quite similar\nmodels. Presumably, all these statements of varying degrees of\ngenerality need explanation. Consequently, those who resist the\n“semantic interpretation” of theories argue that we might\nas well treat each as a substitution instance of the principle of\nnatural selection generated by a different probabilistic propensity\nmeasure of fitness as a distinct empirical generalization to begin\nwith instead of a model-theoretic definition. But, one will want to\nask, does this set of generalizations with similar antecedents and\nidentical consequents have something in common, which in turn explains\nand unifies them, or are they the fundamental principles of the theory\nof natural selection? The question is obviously rhetorical. For each\nof the members of the set of functions that turn the definition-schema\nfor fitness into a complete property is a measurement of the fitness\nof some actual or potential individuals or populations. Each is a\nmeasurement appropriate to its particular environmental circumstances,\na measurement inappropriate for the same or different individuals at\ndifferent locations or times in the same environment. \n\nOne alternative is to allow that the PNS is a necessary truth but\ncontinue to hold that it has explanatory content, and can figure in\ncausal explanations of evolutionary outcomes. This is a view advanced\nby Sober (see Sober 2002) and examined in Lange and Rosenberg\n(2011). As we shall see in the next section, another possibility is to\nrelativize reproductive rates in favor of another universal measure of\nfitness.  \n\nIn previous sections, we remarked on the difficulty of identifying the\nprecise propensity that could, according to some, ground fitness\nascriptions. Moreover, it is often difficult to isolate the\npopulations where the evolutionary change is occurring. This is in\npart an operational problem, but for many biological systems, this\ndifficulty may in fact reveal a deeper ontological issue. Thinking\nabout fitness in reproductive terms depends on the possibility of\nidentifying offspring (or successive replicators) and populations of\nthem. For most Metazoans, this appears to be relatively\nstraightforward. But how are we to treat the evolution of colonies,\nclonal organisms and symbionts (and hypothetically ecosystems)? Many\nphilosophers have argued that our philosophy of biology’s usual\nbestiary does not reflect some of the complex organisation actually to\nbe found in nature (J. Wilson 1999, D.S. Wilson and Sober 1989,\nGodfrey-Smith 2009, O’Malley and Dupré 2007, Bouchard and\nHuneman 2013) For many biological systems, organismal boundaries seem\narbitrary ways to carve up the biological world. Those boundaries may\nmerely reflect an impoverished way of thinking about biological\nindividuality (Pradeu 2012, Haber 2013). Many biological individuals\nare in fact complex arrangements of other individuals. When these\nindividuals belong to a single species (ex. some eusocial insects) a\ngene selectionist view according to which fitness is understood as the\ndifferential reproductive success of alleles may be available. But in\nthe case of multi-species communities (e.g., fungus-termite colonies),\nallelic success will not track evolutionary change since some of the\nadaptations are not fully biotic (Bouchard 2009). Moreover, it has\nbeen argued (Turner 2004, Bouchard 2004, 2008) that some individuals\nthat are adapting are not reproducing at all.  \n\nBiological individuality is much more varied and heterogeneous than\npreviously believed and this additional complexity puts pressure on\nthe notion that reproductive success can act as a ‘universal\ncurrency’ of fitness. The difficulties of establishing\nreproductive success for some clonal organisms, for collectives of\norganisms and for multi-species assemblages has led some biologists\nand philosophers to entertain alternative concepts of fitness. Leigh\nVan Valen, in his attempts to develop a theory of evolution that would\nallow for the evolution of whole communities (Van Valen 1975, 1989,\n1991), suggested that fitness as energy control could explain the\nevolution of a broader range of biological systems. “Rather than\nsaying that natural selection is expected differential reproduction,\nwe should say that it is expected differential expansion” (Van\nValen 1989, 7). By ‘expansion’ Van Valen doesn’t\nmean expansion in physical space (although that may occur) but\nexpansion in resource or energy space. In this approach, energy is\nseen as the ‘universal currency’: a fitter community is\none that controls more energy than another community. For\n‘simpler’ biological systems such as sexual species with\ndiscrete generations, increased reproductive success is a good proxy\nfor increased energy success and therefore previous measurements and\nmodels of reproductive output remain useful but their explanatory\nexhaustiveness is relativized. Although energy can seem to be a\nuniversal measure of fitness that could apply to the all the varied\ntypes of biological individuals that can emerge, it’s not clear\nthat Van Valen’s approach can be as universal as desired since\nit has difficulty explaining increases in efficiency in energy control\n(see Bouchard 2004 chap 3 for analysis). This has motivated Bouchard\n(2004, 2008, 2011) to argue for an account of evolution focusing on\ndifferential persistence (reminiscent of Thoday 1953). Bouchard (2004,\n2008, 2011) argues that Persistence Through Time of a lineage is the\nproperty maximized by evolution by natural selection: maximization of\nrelative reproductive success or maximization of energy control are\nonly two dominant strategies for persistence increase (see Bourrat\n2014 and Doolittle 2014 for related approaches). In this approach\n(lineage) \\(X\\)is fitter than (lineage) \\(Y\\) if \\(X\\)has a higher\npropensity to persist for \\(Z\\) amount of time than \\(Y\\). Some of the\nproblems of propensities remain, but we gain a way to assess\necological fitness (probability of persistence) in a way that can be\nindependent of reproductive success. Persistence is the overarching\ndesign-problem. Increased reproductive potential is but one powerful\nway to increase one’s potential to persist.  \n\nThe question of how to define biological individuality is an\nontological question about what individuals can evolve in response to\nnatural selection. Many biological systems differ in form and in\nfunction from our garden variety Metazoans. How are we to understand\nthe evolution of symbiotic communities involving bacteria with lateral\ngene transfer? How are we to make sense of the complex traits of\neusocial insects? Not all these emergent individuals qua individuals\nreplicate. Whether it’s by focusing on energy or persistence (or\nsome other account) a complete understanding of fitness should reflect\nthat fact—or accept that it cannot alone account for some\nadaptive change in the biological world.  \n\nThe difficulties that face both the subjective probability view of\nfitness and the probabilistic propensity definitions of fitness are\nserious enough to make the notion of “ecological fitness”\nworth revisiting. Recall that on this view ‘\\(a\\) is fitter than\n\\(b\\) in \\(E\\)’ is defined as ‘\\(a\\)’s traits result\nin its solving the design problems set by \\(E\\) more fully than\n\\(b\\)’s traits.’ The terms in which this definition is\ncouched are certainly in as much need of clarification as is\n‘fitness’. It is cold philosophical comfort to point out\nthat definitions have to stop somewhere, that the definition of a\ntheoretical term must be distinct from the operational measure of the\nproperty it names, and that testability is not a matter of theory\nmeeting data one proposition at a time. In consequence none of these\nconsiderations have convinced philosophers of biology to accept the\ndesign problem definition, and to give up the project of defining\nfitness by reference to its effects in reproduction. Nevertheless,\nthere does appear to be important biological work that the ecological\nfitness concept can do, and which no definition of fitness in terms of\ndifferential reproductive rates—actual, expected, or\ndispositional—can do. \n\nTo see what these tasks are, consider the question, How do we decide\nwhether a divergence from a long run relative frequency prediction\nabout fitness differences is a matter of drift, a disconfirmation of\nthe hypothesis of natural selection, or a reflection of a\nmismeasurement of fitness differences to begin with? Suppose we\nmeasure the fitness differences between population \\(a\\) and\npopulation \\(b\\) to be in the ratio of 7:3 (e.g., \\(w_a = 1\\), \\(w_b =\n.428\\)) and suppose further that in some generation, the actual\noffspring ratio is 5:5. There are four alternatives: (a) the fitness\nmeasure of 7:3 is right but there was drift—i.e., the initial\nconditions at this generation are unrepresentative of those which\nobtain in all relevant generations; (b) the fitness measure of 7:3 was\nincorrect and there was no drift; (c) both drift and wrong fitness\nmeasure or (d) the principle of natural selection is\ndisconfirmed. Ignoring the fourth alternative, how do we discriminate\namong the first three of these? \n\nIn the absence of information about the initial conditions of the\ndivergence, there is only one way empirically to choose between\nalternatives (a)–(c). This way requires that there are\necological fitness differences, and that we can detect them. Suppose\nthat fitness differences were matters of probabilistic differential\nreproductive success (no matter what interpretation of probability is\nadopted). Then the only access to fitness differences is via\npopulation censuses in previous generations (since these form the\nbases of the probabilities). Suppose that this census does indeed show\na 7:3 ratio between as and bs in the recent past. In order to exclude\nthe absence of fitness differences instead of drift, as the source of\nthe current generation’s 5:5 outcome, we need to be able to\nestablish that the 7:3 differences in previous populations were not\nthemselves the result of drift. But this is the first step in a\nregress, since we began with the problem of discriminating drift from\nmismeasures of fitness. To solve the initial problem, we now have to\nassure ourselves that the 7:3 ratios in the past were not the result\nof drift. Whence the regress. Of course the problem does not arise\nif we have access to fitness differences independently of previous\npopulation censuses. And this access we have, at least in\nprinciple, if fitness is a matter of differences in the solution of\nidentifiable design problems, that is, if there is such a thing as\necological fitness and it is (fallibly) measured by probabilistic\npropensities to leave offspring. \n\nOnce we have access to ecological fitness differences, we can, at\nleast in principle, decide whether the divergence from predicted\nlong-run relative frequencies, especially where small populations are\nconcerned, is a matter of drift or reflects our ignorance either of\necological fitness differences or the unrepresentativeness of the\ninitial conditions of individual births, deaths, and\nreproductions. \n\nThis result also has important implications for the interpretation of\nthe theory of natural selection as one wholly about populations, and\nnot also about individual fitness differences, discussed above\n(individual versus trait fitness). Note that the problem of\ndistinguishing drift from selection in ensembles—i.e., large\npopulations—has the same character, and is in principle\nsusceptible to the same solution as the problem of drift makes for\nevolution among lineages with small numbers of individual members. We\ncan distinguish drift from selection in ensembles as well, if\nwe accept that there is such epistemic access to ecological fitness\ndifferences and to the initial conditions of births, deaths and\nreproductions, taken one at a time, and we accept that these\nindividual-differences aggregate into ensemble-differences. \n\nBecause populations no matter how large are always finite in size,\nthere is always some drift which needs to be distinguished from\nfitness differences. Thus even in population biology there is in the\nend no substitute for ecological fitness and no way to dispense with\nits services to the theory of natural selection. And since ecological\nfitness is ultimately a relationship between organisms (or\nindividuals) taken two at a time, the theory is as much a set of\nclaims about individuals as it is about populations. \n\nThis line of reasoning highlights the next phase of the debate. From a\ndiscussion about fitness, the debate has evolved into a general debate\nconcerning the nature of natural selection and drift. A number of\nalternative views have emerged in thinking about these topics. Some\n(e.g., Walsh, Lewens, Ariew, and Matthen) think about natural\nselection solely as population wide patterns caused by non selective\nprocesses: this view deprives fitness of any causal or explanatory\npower. Others (e.g., Millstein and Stephens) see fitness and natural\nselection as a cause, operating at the population level, to bring\nabout the differential reproduction rates. Finally others argue that,\nif it is to play an explanatory role in our theory, fitness has to be\nan individual and causal concept. As these debates suggest, far from\nbeing merely a 19th century slogan, understanding the\nmeaning of the “survival of the fittest” is of\nphilosophical and biological urgency.","contact.mail":"f.bouchard@umontreal.ca","contact.domain":"umontreal.ca"}]
