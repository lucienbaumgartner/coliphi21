In Kant’s conception, an argument of this kind begins\nwith a compelling premise about our thought, experience, or knowledge,\nand then reasons to a conclusion that is a substantive and unobvious\npresupposition and necessary condition of this premise. The crucial\nsteps in this reasoning are claims to the effect that a subconclusion\nor conclusion is a presupposition and necessary condition of a\npremise. Such a necessary condition might be a logically necessary\ncondition, but often in Kant’s transcendental arguments the\ncondition is necessary in the sense that it is the only possible\nexplanation for the premise, whereupon the necessity might be weaker\nthan logical. Typically, this reasoning is intended to be a\npriori in some sense, either strict (Smit 1999) or more relaxed\n(Philip Kitcher 1981, Pereboom 1990). The conclusion of the argument\nis often directed against skepticism of some sort. For example,\nKant’s Transcendental Deduction targets Humean skepticism about\nthe applicability of a priori metaphysical concepts, and his\nRefutation of Idealism takes aim at skepticism about external\nobjects. These two transcendental arguments are found in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), but such arguments\nare found throughout Kant’s writings, for example in\nthe Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785), in\nthe Critique of Practical Reason (1788), in the Critique\nof the Power of Judgment (1790), and in the Opus\nPosthumum (1804; Förster 1989). This article focuses on the\nTranscendental Deduction, the Refutation of Idealism, and more recent\ntranscendental arguments that are inspired by Kant’s work.\n\n\nThe Transcendental Deduction (A84–130, B116–169) is Kant’s\nattempt to demonstrate against empiricist psychological theory that\ncertain a priori concepts correctly apply to objects featured\nin our experience. Dieter Henrich (1989) points out that Kant’s use of\n‘Deduktion’ redeploys German legal vocabulary; in\nHoly Roman Empire Law, ‘Deduktion’ signifies an\nargument intended to yield a historical justification for the\nlegitimacy of a property claim. In Kant’s derivative epistemological\nsense, a deduction is an argument that aims to justify the use of a\nconcept, one that demonstrates that the concept correctly applies to\nobjects. For Kant a concept is a priori just in case its\nsource is the understanding of the subject and not sensory experience\n(A80/B106; Strawson 1966: 86). The specific a priori concepts\nwhose applicability to objects of experience Kant aims to vindicate in\nthe Transcendental Deduction are given in his Table of Categories\n(A80/B106); they are Unity, Plurality, and Totality (the Categories of\nQuantity); Reality, Negation, and Limitation (the Categories of\nQuality); Inherence and Subsistence, Causality and Dependence, and\nCommunity (the Categories of Relation), and Possibility-Impossibility,\nExistence-Nonexistence, Necessity-Contingency (the Categories of\nModality). \nDavid Hume in effect denies that a deduction can be provided for a\nnumber of metaphysical concepts – ideas, in his\nterminology – including the ideas of personal identity, of\nidentity over time more generally, of the self as a subject distinct\nfrom its perceptions, and of causal power or force (1739, 1748). In\nHume’s view, a concept can only be validated by finding a sensory\nexperience, that is, an impression, in particular the one\nthat is the ‘original’ of that idea, which must resemble\nthat idea. But because, for example, any attempt to find an impression\nof causal power turns out to be fruitless, Hume concludes that this\nidea does not legitimately apply (1748: §7). In Kant’s\nterminology, Hume is determining whether one might provide\nan empirical deduction of the concept of causal power\n(A85/B117), and from the failure of the attempt to do so, he concludes\nthat this concept lacks objective validity, that is, it does\nnot apply to the objects of our experience. \nHume’s position on the deducibility of a priori\nmetaphysical concepts is Kant’s quarry in the Transcendental\nDeduction. But Kant concurs with Hume’s proposal that no\nempirical deduction can be supplied for such concepts. Instead, he\nsets out to provide a different sort of justification for their use,\none that is transcendental rather than empirical. Such a\ntranscendental deduction begins with a premise about any possible\nhuman experience, a premise to which reasonable participants in the\ndebate can be expected initially to agree, and then contends that a\npresupposition and necessary condition of the truth of that premise is\nthe applicability of the a priori concepts in question to the\nobjects of experience. Kant’s Transcendental Deduction features\na number of component transcendental arguments. Each begins with a\npremise either about the self-attributability of mental\nitems, apperception, or else a premise about the necessity\nand universality of some feature of our experience of\nobjects. Kant’ strategy is to establish a theory of mental\nprocessing, synthesis, by arguing that its truth is a\nnecessary condition for the truth of such a premise, and then to show\nthat the a priori concepts at issue – the categories\n– have an essential role in this sort of mental processing. On a\nmetaphysical idealist interpretation of his position, the objects of\nexperience result from this mental processing, and it is due to the\nrole that the categories have in this processing that they correctly\napply to objects. In the Transcendental Deduction Kant would thus\nintend to secure a normative claim, that the categories correctly\napply to the objects of our experience, by establishing a\npsychological theory (Henrich 1989; Patricia Kitcher 1990: 2–29;\nfor information on related argumentative strategies in Kant’s\nhistorical context, see Kuehn 1997 and Dyck 2011). The Transcendental\nDeduction presents general considerations supporting the applicability\nof all the categories to the objects of our experience; it does not\nconcentrate on the applicability of specific categories.  This more\nfocused task is taken up in various sections of the Analytic of\nPrinciples (A130–235/B169–287). \nIn the Metaphysical Deduction (A66–83, B92–116)\nKant intends to derive the categories from the specific modes or forms\nof any human thought about the world, the logical forms of\njudgment. The Metaphysical Deduction has an essential role to\nplay in the Transcendental Deduction, and we will discuss this\nargument at an appropriate juncture (when we reach §19 of the\nB-Deduction). \nFor Kant, the most significant rival theory of mental processing is\nthat of his target, Hume. Hume concurs that a theory of experience\nrequires an account of the processing of mental items, but he denies\nthat such an account demands a priori concepts or issues in\ntheir legitimate applicability to experience. According to his theory,\nassociationism, our mental repertoire consists solely of\nperceptions, all of which are sensory items – the more vivid\nimpressions, which constitute sensory experience, and their less vivid\ncopies, the ideas, which function in imagination, memory, reasoning,\nand conceptualization (1748, §§2, 3). Association is the\nprocess by which these perceptions are related and ordered. A\nsignature feature of association on Hume’s view is that it requires no\nresources distinct from the perceptions themselves. How perceptions\nare ordered is solely a function of what perceptions alone can\nprovide. Significantly, a subject not constituted solely of\nperceptions has no role in Hume’s theory; the Humean subject is just a\ncollection of perceptions (1739: I, IV, vi).  These last two features\nin particular make Humean associationism a highly economical theory,\nwhich provides it with an initial advantage over Kant’s more complex\nview. However, Kant contends that associationism cannot account for\nthe facts to which the premises of the Transcendental Deduction\nappeal, and that synthesis by a priori concepts, that is, the\ncategories, is required in addition. \nKant characterizes synthesis as “the act of putting\ndifferent representations together, and grasping what is manifold in\nthem in one cognition” (A77/B103); it is a process that “gathers the\nelements for cognition, and unites them to form a certain content”\n(A78/B103). Synthesis takes multiple representations – in\nKant’s terminology, a ‘manifold’ – and connects them\nwith one another to produce a single further representation with\ncognitive content (Patricia Kitcher 1990, 2011). This process employs\nconcepts as modes or ways of ordering representations. A claim critical\nto the Transcendental Deduction is that it is the categories by means\nof which manifolds of our representations are synthesized. Since the\nunderstanding of the subject is the source of the categories, and also\na faculty that yields synthesis, the subject plays a crucial role in\nmental processing. It is important for Kant’s view on mental\nprocessing that this subject is distinct from its representations, and\nthis is another respect in which it differs from Hume’s\ntheory. \nThis discussion will focus on the Transcendental Deduction in the\nsecond edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787) – the \nB-Deduction – thoroughly rewritten and rethought\nrelative to the A-Deduction of the first edition (1781). On\nmy reading, in §§16–20 of the B-Deduction Kant employs\na two-pronged strategy for defeating associationism and establishing\nsynthesis. The first, contained in §§15–16, is\ndesigned to show that association cannot account for an aspect of\none’s consciousness of one’s self that Kant refers to as  the\nconsciousness of its unity, and that synthesis is required to\nprovide this explanation. This type of argument he calls\nan argument from above, signifying that it begins with a\npremise about self-consciousness.  Correlatively, in\n§§17–20 we find an argument from below, by\nwhich Kant intends to establish that synthesis by means of the\ncategories is needed as a necessary condition of how we represent\nobjects (the above/below terminology is derived from A119; for\nrelevant historical background, see Carl 1989, 1992). On several other\nreadings, as we shall see, the B-Deduction is a more unified\nargument. There are reasons to accept and reasons to resist\ninterpretations of this kind. \nThe argument from above in §16 can be divided into two\nstages. The goal of the first is to establish the various components\nof the principle of the necessary unity of apperception. The\nsecond stage aims to show that synthesis is a necessary condition for\nthe aforementioned aspect of self-consciousness, which this principle\nhighlights. Apperception is the apprehension of a mental\nstate – a representation, in Kant’s terminology – as one’s\nown; one might characterize it as the self-ascription or\nself-attribution of a mental state (Strawson 1966: 93–4). In\nKant’s conception, my apperception has\nnecessary unity since all of my representations\nmust be grounded “in pure apperception, that is, in the\nthoroughgoing identity of the self in all possible\nrepresentations” (B131–2, emphasis mine). By this he means\nthat: \n\nOne might note three aspects of the meaning of this principle.  First,\nas pointed out earlier, Kant maintains that the apperceiving subject\nis not itself a collection of representations. Kant affirms that I\nhave no inner intuition of the subject (e.g. B157), and this claim\nwould conflict with the subject’s being a collection of\nrepresentations, since he holds that I can intuit my representations\nby inner sense (e.g. A33/B49). Also, in §16 Kant remarks:\n“through the ‘I’, as simple representation, nothing\nmanifold is given; only in intuition, which is distinct from the\n‘I’, can a manifold be given” (B135). If he believed\nthe apperceiving subject to be a collection of representations, it\nwould be surprising for him to deny that anything manifold is given\nthrough my representation of it.  Second, my ability to attribute\nrepresentations to myself as subject of them is pure, as\nopposed to empirical apperception. This means that I have\nthis ability not in virtue of Humean inner perception, or Kantian\ninner intuition, but rather independently of any such empirical\nfaculties. However, Kant repeatedly affirms that the purity of this\napperception does not imply that the subject to which one’s\nrepresentations can be attributed is intuited – represented as\nan object – in a purely rational or a priori way (e.g.,\nB406–9). Third, Kant states that pure apperception\nis original, and the explication he provides is that\n“it is that self-consciousness which, while generating the\nrepresentation ‘I think’ … cannot itself be\naccompanied by any further representation” (B132). I cannot have\nan intuition or any other type of representation of myself as\napperceiving subject other than by way of ‘I\nthink…’-type thoughts, and hence these thoughts are the\noriginal representations of this subject (e.g., A350). At the same\ntime, by virtue of my capacity for apperception, I can have a kind of\npropositional grasp of the apperceiving subject; Kant affirms that in\napperception, I am conscious that I exist as subject\n(B157). (For recent extensive discussions of Kant on self-knowledge,\nsee Rosefeldt 2000, Kitcher 2011, and Longuenesse 2017; cf. Howell\n2001.) \nKant initiates the first stage of the argument in §16 by\nclaiming: \n\nOn one interpretation, the sense in which a representation would be\nimpossible or nothing to me if it could not accompanied with the\n‘I think’ is simply that I could not then become conscious\nof it (Guyer 1987: 139–44). It is credible that for any\nrepresentation of which I am conscious, I can attribute it to\nmyself as subject, assuming my mental faculties are in working order,\nand if no controversial account of the nature of the subject is\npresupposed. However, the claim that I can become conscious of\neach of my representations, and that it is therefore possible\nfor me attribute each of them to myself as their subject, is likely\nfalse. Plausibly, some of my representations are so thoroughly\nsubconscious that I cannot attribute them to myself, while they are\nnevertheless mine due to the causal relations they bear to other\nrepresentations and to actions that are paradigmatically\nmine. Fortunately, however, the premise that each of my\nrepresentations is such that I can attribute it to myself is not\ncrucial for the argument from above. Rather, the premise Kant\nultimately singles out is less committed, and focuses more\nspecifically on the identity or sameness of the subject of different\nself-attributions, and my being conscious of this identity. \nA number of interpreters, including Robert Howell (1992) and James van\nCleve (1999), maintain that the argument of §16 requires a premise\naffirming the possibility of my being simultaneously conscious\nof the multiple elements of my representations, and that the implausibility\nof this premise jeopardizes the soundness of the argument.\nHowell’s specific objection is that Kant does not\nestablish the following crucial premise: \n\n(S) asserts that all of the individual elements of the selected\nintuition are such that the subject is or can become conscious of them\nsimultaneously. In Howell’s interpretation, only if the elements of an\nintuition together and at the same time are accompanied by the\nsame I think will it be plausible that the subject must\nsynthesize these elements (Howell 1992: 162). On van Cleve’s reading,\nit is required that for any intuition that I have, I actually become\nsimultaneously conscious of its elements. If this co-consciousness\nwere just merely possible, Kant could only conclude is that the\nresulting representation is only possibly subject to the categories\n(van Cleve 1999: 84). On an interpretation of this type, the mechanism\nof the argument of §16 is to adduce a kind of unity or\ncombination that my representations actually exhibit, and then to\nargue that this unity requires synthesis by means of the categories as\na condition or for its explanation. Kant is thus read as contending\nthat actual co-consciousness is a type of unity that demands synthesis\nby means of the categories, and that any variety of unity short of\nco-consciousness will be inadequate to establishing this objective of\nthe Deduction. \n\nHowell points out that (S) contrasts with a weaker claim: \n\nwhich allows that the individual elements of the intuition are such\nthat the subject can only become conscious of each separately, perhaps\nin turn. He contends, however, that the unity expressed by (W) is\ninsufficient to generate this need for synthesis. If I am merely\n(possibly or actually) serially conscious of the elements of an\nintuition, it won’t be required that I synthesize them into a unified\nintuition. Howell goes on to argue that while (W) is credible, Kant\ncannot in fact establish (S); it is implausible that such\nco-consciousness for any arbitrary intuition is actual or even\ngenuinely possible for us. Consequently, the soundness of this\nargument, and the overall argument of the B-Deduction is\nimperiled. \nHowever, it may be that only the weaker premise (W) is required for the\nsuccess of the argument of §16. First, although the\nco-consciousness premise (S) might be suggested in §16 by\nthe following text: \n\nthat claim is not uncontroversially made here. For by the assertion\nthat I “am conscious of the synthesis of them,” i.e., of\nthese representations, Kant may mean only that I am conscious that\nthey stand in a certain intimate relation to one another, for\ninstance, that that they are integrated with each other in a way\ndistinct from how mine are integrated with yours, which does not\nrequire co-consciousness (Pereboom 1995). \nMoreover, it might well be that the argument of §16 features a\nsubtlety that obviates the need for actual co-consciousness. The text\nindicates that the argument crucially turns on the claim that\nonly a priori synthesis – that is, synthesis by a\npriori concepts – can explain how I might represent the\nidentity of my apperceptive consciousness (B133) or how I\nmight represent the identity of the apperceiving subject (B135)\nfor different elements of the manifold of intuition to which I can\nattach the I think. The inadequacy Kant claims for\n“empirical consciousness,” that is, for consciousness\naccording to Humean psychological theory, is that “it is in\nitself dispersed (an sich zerstreut) and without relation to\nthe identity of the subject (und ohne Beziehung auf die\nIdentität des Subjects)” (B133). One implication of\nthis passage is that Hume’s theory does not have the resources needed\nto explain how I can self-attribute various of my representations or\ntheir elements to a subject that is both conscious of them and the\nsame subject for each act of their self-attribution. This objection\ndoes not beg the question in Kant’s dispute with Hume, since it\nassumes only a claim that uncommitted and reasonable participants in\nthis discussion would not want to initially deny, that the conscious\nsubject of these apperceptive self-attributions is the same. Hume’s\ntheory lacks the resources to account for this identity. Hume himself\nprovides no account of apperception, but possibilities for a Humean\naccount are that apperceptive consciousness amounts to perceptions\nthat are intrinsically self-conscious, or else consists in perceptions\nof perceptions.  But intrinsically self-conscious perceptions would be\ndistinct from one another, as would perceptions of perceptions; and\nthus they too would be “dispersed” (B133), and share no\ncommon element. Hume might propose to explain our sense of the\nidentity of the conscious subject of different self-attributions by\nthe intrinsically self-conscious perceptions or the perceptions of\nperceptions being components of a single causally coherent\nbundle. However, this bundle would not itself be conscious of\nperceptions. Consciousness of perceptions would instead be an\nintrinsic feature of an individual self-conscious perception or a\nfeature of individual perceptions of a perception. In Kant’s\nconception, by contrast, accounting for our sense of the identity of\nthe conscious subject of different self-attributions requires that\nthis subject be distinct from its representations. \nThe second stage of the argument of §16 highlights another\nimplication of the claim that “the empirical consciousness,\nwhich accompanies different representations, is\ndispersed and without relation to the identity of the subject” (B133):\nthat Hume’s theory lacks the resources to account for my\nrepresentation-relation to the identity of the subject; that\nis, this view cannot explain how I can “represent to myself\nthe identity of the consciousness in [i.e.  throughout] these\nrepresentations” (B133) (for an opposing view see Dickerson\n2004: 95–8). We might imagine several kinds of explanation for my\nrepresentation of this identity. One candidate is that inner sense\nallows me to represent this identity: the way I represent the sameness\nof the subject is akin to how I commonly represent the identity over\ntime of ordinary objects – by a cognitive sensitivity to\nsimilarities among the intrinsic properties represented. However, Kant\nand Hume concur that this is not how I might represent the identity of\nthe apperceiving subject, since they agree that by inner sense I\ncannot represent any intrinsic properties of such a subject. A second\nkind of explanation, which Kant endorses, is that I have an indirect\nway of representing this identity. This representation must instead\ndepend on my apprehending a feature of my representations (or elements\nof them) (Allison 1983: 142–4; Guyer 1977: 267, 1987:\n133–39; Patricia Kitcher 2011: 147). The appropriate feature is a\ntype of unity or ordering of these states. The idea is that if the\nrepresentations I can attribute to myself possess a unity of the right\nkind, and if I apprehend or am cognitively sensitive to this unity,\nthen I will be able to represent the apperceiving subject of any one\nof them as identical with that of any other. \nThus my representation of the identity of the subject comes about “only\nin so far as I conjoin one representation with another, and am\nconscious of the synthesis of them” (B133). This consciousness is\nprofitably interpreted as conscious awareness not of the act or process\nof synthesis itself, but rather of the unity that is its outcome\n(Strawson 1966: 94–6; Dicker 2004: 133–4)). What sort of unity must I\nconsciously recognize among my representations that would account for\nmy representation of this identity? Note that it is not plausibly\nco-consciousness, for I represent the subject as identical for\nself-attributed representations that are not co-conscious, so actual\nco-consciousness could not explain generally how I represent this sort\nof identity. A credible alternative is that the unity consists in\ncertain intimate ways in which representations in a single subject are\ntypically related. Arguably, the essential feature of this unity is\nthat a single subject’s representations be inferentially and causally\nintegrated to a high degree, and in this respect they are unified in a\nway in which representations possessed by discrete subjects are not.\nAlternatively, several commentators have argued that\nthe relevant unity might be a temporal order among my representations,\nthereby linking the B-Deduction with the arguments of the Second\nAnalogy and the Refutation of Idealism (Guyer 1977: 267; Dicker 2004:\n137–44). A concern about this route is that a cognitive sensitivity to\nthe time-ordering of representations does not obviously facilitate our\nrepresenting them as belonging to a single subject (Brueckner 1984:\n199–208). By contrast, when mental states fail to exhibit inferential\nand causal integration, as in the case of multiple-personality\ndisorder, we have a tendency to posit multiple subjects, while we do\nnot do so when such integration is present. \nIn Kant’s view, the candidates for explaining how this kind of unity\ncomes to be, or, less ambitiously, for explaining my ability to\nrecognize this sort of unity, are association and synthesis. At this\npoint he appears to suppose that because Hume’s psychological theory\nhas already been ruled out, synthesis is the only remaining option. So\nfor me to represent the identity of the subject of different\nself-attributions, I must generate or at least recognize the right\nsort of unity among these representations, and synthesis must be\ninvoked to account for this unity. Thus Kant contends that this\ncombination “is an affair of the understanding alone, which\nitself is nothing but the faculty of combining a\npriori” (B134–5. Since the understanding provides\nconcepts for synthesis, and because for synthesis to be a\npriori is, at least in part, for it to employ a priori\nconcepts, Kant is contending here that synthesis by means of a\npriori concepts is required to account for the unity in\nquestion. Here is an austere representation of the structure of the argument\nso far: \nPremise (1) is intended as a claim the skeptic about the legitimate\napplicability of a priori concepts will at least initially\naccept. The crucial necessary conditions, expressed by (3) and (7),\nare necessary conditions of only possible explanation. However, Paul\nGuyer forcefully argues that establishing the need for synthesis by\nmeans of a priori concepts would require ruling out the\nalternative explanation that empirical information and concepts\nderived from it is sufficient to account for the recognition of the\nunity at issue (Guyer 1987:146–7). And in his view it remains\nopen, given what Kant has shown, that this recognition requires only\nawareness of information derived from inner sense or introspective\nexperience. Kant does not attempt at this point in the argument to\nrule out such a rival empiricist hypothesis, but he arguably would\nneed to do so to establish the need for a priori\nsynthesis. To advance his claims, one might appeal to features of this\nunity that would render such an empiricist account inadequate. As we\nshall see, Kant employs this tactic in the next phase of the argument,\nwhich introduces his account of our representations of objects. \nAccording to one widespread reading of the B-Deduction,\n§§15–20 comprise a an argument whose only assumption\nis the premise about self-consciousness that Kant defends in §16.\nStrawson, for example, is a proponent of such an interpretation\n(1966), as are Robert Paul Wolff (1963), Jonathan Bennett (1966),\nHenry Allison (1983), Edwin McCann (1985), and Dennis Schulting\n(2012a). Demonstrating that we represent objects or an objective world\nhas a key role in most versions of this reading. On Strawson’s\ninterpretation, for instance, “the fact that my experience is of\na unified objective world is a necessary consequence of the fact that\nonly under this condition could I be conscious of my diverse\nexperiences as one and all my own” (1966: 94). Some interpreters\ndissent; Karl Ameriks, for example, contends that Strawson’s\nconception of the Deduction is motivated by a desire to see it as\nshowing that the skeptic about the external world is mistaken, while\nin fact refuting this sort of skeptic is not one of Kant’s aims\nfor this argument (Ameriks 1978; also Allais 2011, 2015). Patricia\nKitcher (2011: 115–18) argues against the single premise about\nself-consciousness interpretation on historical and textual\ngrounds. \n\nAn uncontroversial role of §17 is to provide a characterization\nof an object, or more to the point, of a representation of an object,\nthat facilitates a challenge to Humean associationism. Kant’s\nproposal is that an object is “that in the concept of which a\nmanifold of a given intuition is united” (B137). Here\n‘object’ should be read in the broad sense\nof objective feature of reality – a feature whose\nexistence and nature is independent of how it is perceived (B 142;\nBird 1962/1973 130–31; Strawson 1966: 98–104; Guyer 1987:\n11–24). Allison is a proponent of the view that §17 contain\nnot only this challenge to Hume, but also an attempt to demonstrate\nthat we represent objects on the basis of the conclusions about\nself-consciousness established in §16. This interpretation is a\ncomponent of Allison’s broader vision of the B-Deduction,\naccording to which Kant demonstrates that the unity of apperception\nentails that we represent objects, and, conversely, that our\nrepresenting objects entails the necessary unity of apperception\n(Allison 1983: 144ff; 2015: 352–55) Indeed, the crucial claim\nfor Allison’s interpretation is that the unity of apperception\nis not only a necessary but also sufficient condition for our\nrepresenting of objects. This he calls the reciprocity\nthesis. Other commentators, including Richard Aquila (1989: 159),\nHowell (1992: 227–8) and Schulting (2012a) agree that the\nB-Deduction features the reciprocity thesis and an attempt to\nestablish its truth, while Ameriks (1978) disagrees. On an account of\nthe sort Ameriks favors, the unity of apperception, and more exactly,\nthe synthesis that explains our consciousness of the identity of the\nsubject, is only a necessary condition for the representation of\nobjects (cf. Allais 2011). \n\nAllison’s interpretation is attractive particularly because it\npromises leverage against the skeptic who denies that we represent\nobjects, and also because this leverage is generated by premises about\nself-consciousness that this skeptic is likely to\naccept. Nevertheless, there are textual and charitable reasons to\nresist this reading (Ameriks 1978, Pereboom 1995; Patricia Kitcher\n2011: 115–60; Vinci 2014: 193–94). First of all, in\n§§18–20 Kant makes significant assumptions about\nfeatures of our representations of objects that exceed anything that\nhe has argued for in §17 or earlier. In particular, §18 he\nassumes that our representations of objects manifest a certain kind of\nnecessity and universality, and this he does not purport to establish\nin §17 or earlier. Moreover, in the summary of the preceding\nsteps of the B-Deduction in §20 Kant does not include premises\nfrom §§15–16. What we actually encounter in §20\nindicates that Kant intends §§17–20, with some help\nfrom §13, to constitute a single, self-contained argument that\ndoes not depend on the conclusions about self-consciousness developed\nin §§15–16. \nOn Allison’s conception, the argument from the unity of\napperception (or, equivalently, from the unity of consciousness) for\nour representing objects occurs in the following passage: \n\nAllison himself presents a problem for his interpretation of this\npassage. He contends, first of all, that the reciprocity thesis is\nencapsulated in this sentence: \n\nand that Kant presents (1) as a direct consequence of the premise\nthat \n\nAllison points out that on this reading Kant’s reasoning appears to\ninvolve a non sequitur, since (2) supports only Kant’s having\nin mind that the unity of consciousness is a necessary condition for\nthe representation of an object, and not for its also being a\nsufficient condition. Howell raises a similar concern: “In\n§17 Kant simply does not make this inference clear, and an air of\nblatant fallacy hovers over this part of his reasoning” (Howell\n1992: 228; for an opposing view see Keller 1998: 80). But Ameriks\nargues that the B-Deduction should not be interpreted as providing an\nargument for the sufficiency claim, and a respectable case can be made\nfor his reading (Ameriks 1978; Pereboom 1995; Patricia Kitcher 2011:\n115–60). \n\nAllison and Howell both argue that (1) should be read as a statement\nof the sufficiency claim. Now in (A) Kant contends that cognitions of\nobjects consist in a determinate relation of representations to\nobjects, and as (1) indicates, this relation is constituted or produced\nby a synthesis that essentially involves the unity of consciousness.\nHowever, (1) does not indicate that the synthesis that involves unity\nof consciousness cannot occur without its resulting in a relation\nof a representation to an object. By analogy, the smelting and molding\nof steel are processes that constitute or produce steel girders,\nbut from this one should not conclude that the processes of\nsmelting and molding steel cannot take place without the production of\nsteel girders. Just as producing steel girders also requires molds of\nparticular shapes, so producing representations of objects might\nrequire, in addition to the synthesis that involves the unity of\nconsciousness, particular concepts of objects. \nIf the sufficiency claim, and with it the reciprocity thesis, is\ndenied, we need an alternative account of how §17 functions in\nthe overall argument of the B-Deduction. It may be that the role of\nthis section is largely to provide a characterization of an object\nthat has a key role in the ensuing challenge to Humean associationism, and\nthereby initiates an argument from below. Kant’s proposal is that an\nobject is “that in the concept of which a manifold of a given\nintuition is united” (B137). The subsequent claim is that the\nunification of a manifold requires synthesis; immediately following\nthe characterization of an object he states that “all\nunification of representations demands unity of consciousness in the\nsynthesis of them” (B137). It seems consistent with these texts\nthat Kant’s characterization of an object is designed just to present\nhis anti-Humean theory of the mental processing required for\nrepresenting objects, and that the subsequent claim for the need for\nsynthesis does not express a view he expects us to accept without\nfurther argument, but rather one he aims to confirm in\n§§18–20. If this argument succeeds, it will turn out\nthat the a priori synthesis required to account for the\nfeatures of our representations of objects Kant singles out is the\nsame process that yields my consciousness of the identity of myself as\nsubject of different self-attributions.  \nIn §18 Kant draws our attention to certain features of our\nrepresentations of objects that, in his view, will serve to defeat\nassociationism and establish a priori synthesis: \n\nFor Kant, a defining feature of our representations of objects is\ntheir objective validity. For a representation to be objectively valid\nit must be a representation of an objective feature of reality, that\nis, a feature whose existence and nature is independent of how it is\nperceived (Guyer 1987:11–24). In this argument, it appears that\nKant just assumes that the representations that make up experience are\nobjectively valid. He then aims to establish that association is\ninadequate because it can yield only representations that are not\nobjectively valid.  In the above passage, Kant contends that our\nobjectively valid representations must in a sense be necessary and\nuniversal. However, the empirical unity of consciousness, which\ninvolves an ordering of representations achieved by association, can\nonly be non-universal, contingent, and hence merely subjectively\nvalid, by contrast with the transcendental unity of apperception,\nwhich involves an ordering that is universal and necessary, and is\ntherefore objectively valid. In Kant’s conception, it is the fact that\nthe transcendental unity of apperception is generated by a\npriori synthesis that allows it to yield an ordering that is\nuniversal, necessary, and objectively valid. (Ameriks 1978, Pereboom\n1995, Patricia Kitcher 2011: 115–60; Allais 2011, 2015; Vinci 2014). On\nLucy Allais’s proposal, empirically we are acquainted with objects,\nbut absent a priori synthesis, empirical representations would be of\nobjects that are indeterminate with respect to multiple possible ways\nof conceptualizing and individuating them. Only with a priori\nsynthesis is the representation of determinate objects possible. The\nconcept of cause has a key role here, since determinacy is\nparadigmatically a function of represented causal unity of objects\n(Allais 2015: 275–85; cf. Beck 1978; Vinci 2014: 134–44). This\ndeterminacy, by virtue of a shared scheme of a priori concepts, yields\nthe universality and necessity Kant has in mind. \n\nTo illustrate and support these claims, Kant invokes examples of the\nordering of phenomena in time that also have the key role in the\ndiscussion of the Second Analogy (cf. Guyer 1987: 87–90; Dicker\n2004: 137–44). There Kant argues that our representations,\nconsidered independently of their content, are always successive.  For\nexample, when I view the front, sides, and back of the house when\nwalking around it, and when I watch a boat float downstream, my\nrepresentations of the individual parts and states occur\nsuccessively. The content of these successive representations,\nhowever, can be represented as either determinately and objectively\nsuccessive or as determinately and objectively simultaneous. And as it\nin fact turns out, despite the representations in each of these\nsequences being subjectively successive, we represent the parts of the\nhouse as objectively simultaneous, and the positions of the boat as\nobjectively successive. How might we account for this difference in\nobjectivity despite the similarity in subjectivity? (Melnick 1973:\n89) \n\nThe important clue for answering this question is that these\nrepresentations of objective simultaneity and succession are universal\nand necessary. It is the universality and necessity of our representing\nthe parts of the house as simultaneous that accounts for our\nrepresenting them as objectively simultaneous, and the universality and\nnecessity of our representing the positions of the boat as successive\nthat accounts for our representing them as objectively successive.\nAssociation is inadequate for accounting for this objectivity because\nit is incapable of yielding such universality and necessity, a defect\nnot shared by synthesis. \n\nA first approximation of the import of ‘universal’ in the house\nexample is: \n\nThe addition of necessity has the following effect on (U): \n\nThis claim would be resisted by Hume if the necessity were specified\nas ranging over all possible circumstances, for Hume’s theory\nwould allow for the possibility of a deviant ordering in unusual\nempirical conditions. But (U-N, first pass) can be reformulated more\nprecisely as \n\nKant’s view is that given only the resources of association, the truth\nof (U-N) cannot be explained. The reason is “whether I can\nbecome empirically conscious of the manifold as simultaneous or as\nsuccessive depends on circumstances or empirical conditions,”\nand so “the empirical unity of consciousness, through\nassociation of representations, itself concerns an appearance, and is\nwholly contingent” (B139–40). Association cannot explain\nthe truth of (U-N), for given only the resources of association, the\nparts of the house will not necessarily or universally be represented\nas objectively simultaneous even supposing only normal empirical\nconditions. Kant asks us to consider an activity, word association,\nwhich functions as a paradigm for association. Word association,\nfamiliarly, does not yield universal and necessary patterns;\n“one person connects the representation of a certain word with\none thing, the other [person] with another thing…”\n(B140). Hume’s own paradigm for association in is the relations among\nparts of a conversation (1748: §3). In such conversations, people\nmake different associations in the same circumstances. Kant’s point is\nthat if the very paradigms for association fail to exhibit the sort of\nnecessity and universality at issue, then the hypothesis that\nassociation is powerful enough to yield such an ordering of\nrepresentations – wherever we find it – is ruled\nout. (Pereboom 1995; Dickerson 2004: 170–77; for an account of a\nmore general relationship in Kant between universality and necessity\non the one hand and apriority on the other, see Smit 2009). Here we should see Kant as advancing his claim for the\napplicability of the categories by ruling out association as an\nexplanation for (U-N). The structure of this (part of the) argument\ncan be represented as follows: We can expand (15) to explicitly note the link to the argument from above: To this we can add the final moves, which are explained in the\nsubsequent sections of the B-Deduction: \nThe key necessary conditions, expressed by (12) and (14), like those\nof the argument from above, are necessary conditions of only possible\nexplanation. \n\nGuyer objects that at various places in the Transcendental Deduction\nKant illegitimately assumes knowledge of necessity, and perhaps this\nargument falls to such a concern (Guyer 1987: 146–7). While this\nconcern has the potential of weakening Kant’s argument, perhaps\nHume would not deny the necessity under consideration at this point in\nthe argument. Hume does maintain that it is in some sense impossible,\ngiven an experience of constant conjunction, that the mind not be\ncarried from an impression of the first conjunct to an idea of the\nnext: \n\nThus Hume himself contends that given certain specific empirical\ncircumstances, a particular type of ordering of perceptions in a sense\nnecessarily comes about. \nA further concern of Guyer’s is that Kant assumes without defense that\nall knowledge of necessity is grounded in a priori concepts. But, in\nresponse, perhaps we need not interpret Kant as arguing directly from\n(U-N) to the claim that the categories correctly apply to objects in\nour experience. Rather, we might see him as advancing his claim for\nthe applicability of the categories by ruling out association as an\nexplanation for (U-N). This transition can be divided into three\nsteps: \n\nThe challenge Kant issues is to explain why, under normal\nconditions, the ordering in question is universal and necessary. Part\nof the best explanation, he believes, is (a), that we must have a\nfaculty for ordering the representations. Hume might agree with this\nconclusion, supposing a sufficiently thin conception of\n‘faculty’. Yet he would deny (b), that this faculty\ndoes not consist solely of sensory items. Kant argues that the\nHumean proposal for a faculty that consists solely of sensory items,\nthe faculty of association, cannot account for the truth of\npropositions such as (U-N), for the very paradigms of association, such\nas word association, and the association of topics in a conversation,\ndo not exhibit the requisite universality and necessity. The\nalternative that can account for the truth of propositions such as\n(U-N) involves affirming (c), that the faculty in question must be one\nthat employs the categories. \n\nThe associationist might counter that sensory experience is\nsufficiently uniform for association to produce the universalities and\nnecessities at issue. Perhaps Kant is too quick to conclude that the\nargument from universality and necessity is decisive, for in addition,\nassociationist objections of this sort must be answered – as\ncontemporary critical discussions of proposals for innate concepts indicate\n(Pereboom 1995: 31–3). But this does not detract from the \nanti-associationist force provided by the sorts of universalities and\nnecessities Kant has in mind, and this fact is recognized by the\ncontemporary discussion. \nIn §§19–20, Kant contends that the vehicle that brings\nabout the synthesis at issue is judgment, and that this vehicle\nemploys certain forms of judgment, which are in turn intimately\nrelated to the twelve categories. By connecting synthesis to judgment\nin this way, and the forms of judgment to the categories, Kant aims to\nshow that we must employ the categories in the synthesis of our\nexperience of objects. \nIn §19, Kant argues that there must be a certain way in which each\nof my representations is unified in the subject, and he identifies this\nway with judgment: “I find that a judgment is nothing but the manner in\nwhich given cognitions are brought to the objective unity of\napperception” (B141). Judgment, Kant proposes, is objectively rather\nthan subjectively valid, and hence exhibits the type of universality\nand necessity that characterizes objective validity (B142). He then\nclaims that without synthesis and judgment as its vehicle, an ordering\nof representations might reflect what appears to be the case, but it\nwould not explain how we make distinctions between objective valid\nphenomena (i.e., objects) and the subjective states they induce. \nIn §20, Kant ties this notion of judgment to the twelve forms of\njudgment presented in the Metaphysical Deduction (A70/B95), and he then\nconnects these forms of judgment to the twelve categories\n(A76–83/B102–9). The claim has often been made that the links Kant\nspecifies between synthesis and judgment, judgment and the forms of\njudgment, the forms of judgment and the categories are not sufficiently\nsupported. Guyer, for example, argues that Kant has not adequately\nestablished the last of these connections, that although Kant claims\nthat the categories are simply the forms of judgment as they are\nemployed in the synthesis of representations in an intuition\n(A79/B104–A80/B105, B143), he has failed to make this claim plausible\n(Guyer 1987: 94–102). It is fair to say that these concerns have merit.\nKant’s assertions about these ties remain more obscure than the\npreceding part of the Transcendental Deduction, and it continues to be\na serious challenge for interpreters to clarify and vindicate them. \nBéatrice Longuenesse (1998), in her interpretation of the\nMetaphysical Deduction, takes up this challenge. In her view, the\nfaculty at issue in the production and use of concepts, the\nunderstanding, is the power to judge (Vermögen zu\nUrteilen), which is ultimately a disposition or a conatus\nto make judgments and to shape how we are affected so that we can make\nthem (Longuenesse 1998: 208, 394). The logical forms of judgment are in\nessence the forms of combination of concepts in judgments. One such\nform is the categorical, which is the form of subject-predicate\njudgments; another is the hypothetical, the form of conditional\njudgments. Kant contends that the logical form of a judgment is what\nmakes it capable of truth or falsity, for by means of such a form a\njudgment can constitute a relation of a subject’s representations\nto an objective feature of reality (Longuenesse 2000, 93–4). For\ninstance, by its categorical form, the judgment ‘the boat is\nmoving’ can constitute the relation of my representations of a\nboat and of motion to an objectively existing boat in motion, and as a\nresult this judgment can be true or false. \nOne role of the logical forms of judgment is in the process of\nanalysis, by which the objects we intuit are subsumed under concepts.\nWhat results from this process is a judgment that expresses what Kant\ncalls an analytic unity – paradigmatically, the unity in\nthe subsumption of several intuited objects under a single concept. But\na logical form of judgment can also function in a different role: in\nthe synthesis of a manifold of an intuition. The result in this case is\na synthetic unity, the unity of a synthesized multiplicity of\nrepresentations in a single intuition. The understanding, as the power\nto judge, functions in each of these two roles; “the same\nfunction that gives unity to concepts in judgment, also gives unity to\nthe mere synthesis of representations in intuition” (A79/B104–5).\nIn its synthetic role, the understanding adds content to the forms of judgment: \n\nThe addition of such transcendental content turns the form of judgment\ninto a category. This content is a feature of the forms of intuition,\nspace and time, which are called upon when the power to judge sets out\nto unify a manifold of intuition (B128–9).  The \ncategories – more precisely, the versions of the categories that are\nschematized for our way of cognizing (A137/B176ff) – are thus\ngenerated from the forms of judgment in the process of synthesizing\nintuitions by the addition of spatial and temporal content. For\nexample, generated from the categorical form of judgment by the\naddition of such content is the category of substance, and generated\nfrom the hypothetical form of judgment in this way is the category of\ncause. (For beings possessing the power of understanding but with\ndifferent forms of intuition, the categories would be schematized\ndifferently from ours.) \nIn §20 Kant, draws a conclusion from the considerations he has so\nfar advanced: “Consequently, the manifold in a given intuition is\nnecessarily subject to the categories” (B143). One might think that\nthis is precisely what Kant intended to establish in the Transcendental\nDeduction, and thus that the argument is brought to an end in §20.\nHowever, in §21 he indicates that the Deduction is not yet\ncomplete: “Thus in the above proposition a beginning is made of a\ndeduction of the pure concepts of understanding” (B144). Kant\ngoes on to explain: \n\nHere a perennial interpretive question arises: how should we\nconstrue the argument we find in §26, together with material from\n§24, which is sometimes designated as the second step of the\nB-Deduction? \nOne position on this interpretive issue is advanced by Erich Adickes\n(1889: 139–4) and H. G. Paton (1936: v. 1, 501), who argue that while\nthe material that precedes §21 constitutes an objective\ndeduction, material in §24 and §26 comprise a\nsubjective deduction. This distinction has its source in the\nPreface to the A edition: \n\nHenrich (1968–69) rejects the Adickes/Paton proposal for the\nreason that in §21 Kant states that the demonstration of the\nvalidity of the categories is completed only in §26, and the\npassage from the A-Preface indicates that this is a task for the\nobjective deduction. In defense of Adickes and Paton, in §20 Kant\nclaims to have established that the categories apply to the manifold\nin any one given intuition, and affirms that he will now show that\ncategories apply to any object presented to the senses. In view of the\naim of the objective deduction, this move would seem to require only a\nstraightforward and trivial application of the result of §20 to\nany empirical intuition we might have (Dickerson 2004:\n195–96). So, on a charitable interpretation of Kant’s agenda,\nshowing that the categories apply to any object presented to the\nsenses plausibly involves considerations beyond the scope of the\nobjective deduction. \nHenrich points out that although in the B-Deduction Kant sought to\navoid the problems of a subjective deduction, this “does not\nmean that he neglected the demand for an explanation of the\npossibility of relating the categories to intuitions.” However,\nby Kant’s account, a subjective deduction features not only an\nexamination of cognitive faculties, but also an investigation of\n“the possibility of the pure understanding,” which would\ninclude an investigation of how the categories are related to\nempirical intuition and to the objects presented to us in such\nintuition. This is precisely the type of inquiry that we encounter in\n§24 and §26 – and Henrich agrees. Thus, in the last\nanalysis, it seems that the views of Henrich, Paton, and Adickes can\nbe reconciled: they concur that the second step aims to show how it is\nthat the categories are related to objects of experience – in\nsuch a way as to show how the categories correctly apply to\nthem. Moreover, this common ground yields a satisfying interpretation\nof the specifics of the text. In §26 Kant contends that our\nintuitive representations of space and time, since they themselves\ncontain a manifold, must also be synthesized by means of the\ncategories. And now, because all objects that can be presented to us\nin intuition are given to us in space and time, our representations of\nthese objects will also be synthesized by the categories. Kant thus\nprovides an explanation of how the categories apply to all the objects\nthat can be presented to the senses, or in experience, by way of the\nmanner in which these objects are given to us (cf. Longuenesse 1998:\n211–33; Keller 1998: 88–94; Dickerson 2004: 196–201;\nPollok 2008; Vinci 2014: 197–229).\n \nThe text of the second step gives rise to a number of general\nimportant interpretive issues for Kant’s overall position. One\nsuch issue, raised by the complex footnote at B160–61, is\nwhether Kant countenances a kind of unity in our representations which\nis not a result of synthesis by a priori concepts, but is\ninstead an upshot of the forms of intuition (McLear 2015) or of the\nproductive imagination independently of the categories (Heidegger\n1929/1997; cf., Longuenesse 1998). What one concludes about the\nfootnote has implications for whether Kant is a conceptualist or a\nnonconceptualist about intuitions or our representations of objects\n(Hanna 2008, 2011, Grüne 2011, Schulting 2012b, McLear\n2015). Robert Hanna (2011) argues that the possibility of\nnonconceptual intuition results in a gap in the argument of the\nB-Deduction, since this would allow for intuitions to which the\ncategories do not apply. Stefanie Grüne (2011) and Schulting\n(2012b) oppose this line of reasoning. \nChristian Onof and Schulting (2015), moderate nonconceptualists,\ncontend that there is a unity, which they call unicity, of space that\nprecedes the understanding and synthesis: it consists in the\nsingularity and infinity of space, and dependence of the parts on the\nwhole of space. It’s for this unicity to be grasped by the\nunderstanding that synthesis is required. Onof and Schulting also\nargue that their interpretation makes sense of the need for the second\nstep. On their view, whether the unicity of space is subject to the\ncategories is a substantive issue, and Allison (2015, 413) also\nendorses this claim.  \n\nIn the transcendental argument of the Refutation of Idealism,\nKant’s target is not Humean skepticism about the applicability of\na priori concepts, but rather Cartesian skepticism about the external\nworld. This argument was added by Kant to the second edition of the\nCritique of Pure Reason (B274–279, with a change\nsuggested in the Preface to B, Bxxxix–Bxli), and subsequently\nembellished and reworked in a series of Reflections (Guyer 1987:\n279–316). More specifically, Kant intends to refute what he\ncalls problematic idealism, according to which the existence of\nobjects outside us in space is “doubtful and\nindemonstrable” (B274). His strategy is to derive the claim that\nsuch objects exist from my awareness that my representations have a\nspecific temporal order. At the present time I am aware of the\nspecific temporal order of many of my past experiences, an awareness\nproduced by memory.  But what is it about what I remember that allows\nme to determine the temporal order of my experiences? There must be\nsomething by reference to which I can correlate the remembered\nexperiences that allows me to determine their temporal order. But\nfirst, I have no conscious states that can play this role. Further,\nthis reference cannot be time itself, for “time by itself is not\nperceived;” Kant argues for this claim in the First Analogy\n(B224–5). As Guyer puts it, it is not as if the content of\nmemories of individual events are manifestly indexed to specific times,\nas sportscasts and videotapes often are (Guyer 1987:\n244). Kant contends that the only other candidate for this reference\nis something outside of me in space, and it must be something\n(relatively) permanent (cf. First Analogy, B224–5). Perhaps this\nclaim is made plausible by how we often actually determine the times\nat which our experiences occur. We use observations of sun’s\npositions, or of a clock that indicates time by way of the period of a\npendulum, or by the period of the vibration of a cesium atom. Kant’s\nargument can be seen as exploiting this fact, together with the\nobservation that there is no similar periodic process in human\nconscious experience considered independently of any spatial objects\nit might represent, and that we lack any awareness of time by itself,\nto show we must perceive objects outside us in space by reference to\nwhich we can determine the temporal order of our past experiences. \nGeorge Dicker provides a compelling initial representation of Kant’s\nargument (Dicker 2004, 2008): \n\nSeveral points of interpretation should be noted. First, it is\ngenerally agreed that the notion of awareness in Premise (1) should be\ninterpreted as a success notion, i.e., that to be aware that I have\nexperiences that occur in a specific temporal order is to correctly\ndetermine that they occur in this order (Allison 1983: 290ff, Guyer\n1987: 293ff, Dicker 2004, 195ff., 2008; Chignell 2010). Second, most\ncommentators concur that the experiences at issue are my past\nexperiences. Guyer suggests that the argument might be extended to\ncombinations of my past and my present experience, but Dicker objects\nthat the fact that past experiences occurred before the present one is\ndirectly knowable by introspection, and so doesn’t require the\nexternal reference (Guyer 1987; Dicker 2004: 195ff.).  Third, Jonathan\nBennett points out that we have single memories whose content spans an\nappreciable length of time that allow us to determine the order of\npast mental states . When one remembers hearing a certain word, one\ncan accurately determine by the content of a single memory that\ncertain phoneme-experiences occurred prior to other\nphoneme-experiences – for example, that one heard\n‘mad’ and not ‘dam’ (Bennett 1966:\n228–9).  Dicker (2004: 201–2) remarks that we may be able\nto determine accurately the order some of our past states by means of\nsuch memories, but we cannot ascertain the order of most of our past\nexperiences in this way. He therefore advocates a restriction of the\nargument to the experiences we can correctly order but not in the way\nBennett adduces.  Fourth, many commentators have noted that we might\nhave perceived time directly. Guyer, as we just saw, suggests that all\nof our conscious experiences might have featured a time clock, much\nlike a television sportscast or a video camera (1987: 244;\ncf. Strawson 1966). But as Dicker points out, in actual fact our\nexperience does not have any such feature, and he is content for\nPremise (4), that time itself cannot serve as the reference whereby I\ncorrectly determine the temporal order of my past experiences, to\nstate a merely contingent fact about us (2004, 2008). Chignell (2010)\nexpresses a concern about interpretations of the Refutation in which\nit is merely a contingent fact about us that the alternative methods\nfor determining the temporal order of my past experiences are\nunavailable, for then the conclusion, that we perceive objects in\nspace, would inherit such mere contingency, which he argues to be at\nodds with Kant’s hopes for the Refutation. Fifth, commentators differ\non the relation that must obtain between the objects in space and the\nexperiences whose temporal order we can correctly determine. Guyer\nargues that the relation must be causal, since “the states of\nthe self are judged to have a unique order just insofar as they are\njudged to be caused… by the successive states of enduring\nobjects” (Guyer 1987: 309; cf.  Dicker 2004: 200, 2008). By\ncontrast, in Allison’s view we require the temporal order of objects\nin space only as a backdrop against which to determine the temporal\norder of our experiences; “an enduring, perceivable object (or\nobjects) is required to provide a frame of reference by means of which\nthe succession, coexistence, and duration of appearances in a common\ntime can be determined” (Allison 1983: 201). If the object in\nspace that provides the reference is the sun, for example, the states\nof the sun don’t need to cause my experiences for me to determine\ntheir temporal order by means of those states. \nThree of the most pressing problems that have been raised for the\nRefutation are the following. First, a skeptic might well reject\nPremise (1) on the ground of a general skepticism about memory\n(Allison 1983: 306–7). Bertrand Russell, for example, suggests\nthat for all I know I was born five minutes ago (Russell 1912). On\nthis skeptical hypothesis, I would be mistaken in my belief that I had\nexperiences A, B, and C which occurred more than five minutes ago,\nfirst A, then B, and lastly C. Plausibly, a skeptic who claimed that\nwe lack adequate justification for a belief that external objects\nexist would likely also be disposed to claim that I lack justification\nfor my belief that I had experiences that occurred in the past in that\nspecific temporal order. Thus Kant’s supposition that Premise (1)\nyields leverage against an external-world skeptic is mistaken\n(cf. Dicker 2008, Chignell 2010). \n\nSecond, consider the claim that my mental states (or the mental\nsubject itself) are as suited as objects in space to function as a\nreference whereby I can correctly judge the temporal order of my past\nexperiences. Suppose I had available as such a reference only the mere\nmental appearance of a digital clock in one corner of my field of\nconsciousness. This would not clearly be less effective than an actual\nclock in space. To this one might reply, with Dicker, that there are no\nactual mental states that are adequate to serve as such a reference.\nHowever, and this is the deeper worry, on Berkeley’s idealist view\naccording to which the esse (to be) of objects in space is\ntheir percipi (to be perceived), any spatial objects would be\nnothing more than mental states of some subject, or aspects of those\nstates, but Berkeleyan spatial perceptions would be as adequate a\nreference by which to determine the temporal order of my past\nexperiences as perceptions of spatial objects that are in some sense\ndistinct from my mental states (cf. Allison 1983: 300–1; Vogel 1993;\nChignell 2010). \n\nThird, one might contend that Kant’s Refutation demonstrates\nthat the reference in question must be (relatively) permanent, and that there is\nnothing in the Berkeleyan spatial realm that satisfies this\nrequirement. However, to this one might respond that the reference\nby which I determine the temporal order of my past experiences need not\nbe permanent in a way that cannot be satisfied by Berkeleyan spatial\nobjects. If in the corner of my field of consciousness featured\ndistinct momentary flashes, every second, indicating the date and time\nto the second, I would be able to determine the temporal order of my\npast experiences by their means (cf., van Cleve, reported in Dicker\n2004: 207). \n\nA note on the second of these concerns: Several commentators have\nargued that Kant’s Refutation of Idealism is meant to undermine any\nmetaphysical sort of idealism, including metaphysical idealisms that\nhave been attributed to Kant (Guyer 1987: 317–29). But while\nthis reading has interesting support, one should hesitate to endorse\nit solely on the ground that Kant maintains that spatial objects are\ndistinct from the states of the perceiver. On a plausible metaphysical\ninterpretation of Kant’s idealism, the esse of objects in\nspace is not their percipi, since Kant’s spatial objects, by\ncontrast with Berkeley’s, are recognition-transcendent. In Berkeley’s\nposition, a subject’s perception of an oar in the water as crooked is\nnot a misperception, for “what he immediately perceives by sight\nis not in error, and so far he is in the right,” and it is\nmisleading only because it is apt to give rise to mistaken inferences\n(Berkeley 1713: Third Dialogue); while for Kant this perception is in\nerror. In Kant’s view, the oar is recognition-transcendent by virtue\nof the Second Postulate’s provision that the actuality of such objects\nis determined causally: \n\nThe actual is that which conforms to the system of empirical causal\nlaws (A225/B272ff.), and because the crookedness of the oar does not so\nconform, it is not actual. How the Second Postulate rules out the\nexistence of the apparent spatial objects of dreams and hallucinations\nis spelled out in the third note to the Refutation of Idealism: \n\nThe objects of dreams and hallucinations don’t meet the criterion of\nactuality of the Second Postulate, that is, according with the laws of\ncausality. Thus while in Berkeley’s view the esse of spatial\nthings consists in their being perceived by the senses, for Kant they\nare the objects of the correct causal/scientific account of the\ncontents of our outer experience. This causal criterion allows that a\nspatial object, or, more precisely, the matter from which it is\nconstituted, is (at least relatively) permanent – which would\nseem ruled out in Berkeley’s position, since the spatial object does\nnot last any longer than the idea does. (Berkeley does say that the\nideas of what “are called real things” differ from\n“those excited in the imagination” by “being less\nregular, vivid, and constant” (Berkeley\n1710, Principles Part I, 33), but for him this difference\ndoes not challenge or undermine the claim that the esse of a\nphysical object is its percipi.) None of this forces a\nmetaphysical realist as opposed to an idealist reading of Kant. \n\nYet at the same time, according to the second concern, the Refutation\nis inadequate even if its ambition is restricted to demonstrating the\nexistence of merely metaphysically ideal but nonetheless\nrecognition-transcendent objects outside us in space. For granting\nthat the Refutation establishes that for me to determine the temporal\norder of my past experiences I must perceive objects in space, it\nfails to show that I need to perceive spatial objects any more\nrealistic than the Berkeleyan ones. More generally, the worry is that\nBerkeleyan version of idealism has the resources to yield as adequate a\nreference for me to determine the temporal order of my past\nexperiences as any rival position Kant is plausibly interpreted as\nendorsing, and that for this reason the Refutation falls short of its\naim.\n \nKant-inspired transcendental arguments against skepticism about the\nexternal world were developed with vigor in the mid-twentieth century,\nnotably by P. F. Strawson, most famously in his Kantian reflections in\nThe Bounds of Sense (1966). These arguments are often\nreinterpretations of, or at least inspired by, Kant’s\nTranscendental Deduction and his Refutation of Idealism. Some are more\nambitious than Kant’s would seem to be, insofar as they attempt\nto refute some variety of skepticism by showing that there is an\nessential commitment of the skeptical position for which the falsity of\nthat position is a necessary condition (Nagel 1997: 60ff.).\nStrawson’s most famous transcendental argument (1966: 97–104) is\nmodeled on the Transcendental Deduction, but explicitly without a\ncommitment to synthesis or any other aspect of Kant’s\ntranscendental psychology. His target is a purely sense-datum\nexperience, which does not feature objects, “conceived of as\ndistinct from any particular states of awareness of them,” that\nis, a Berkeleyan experience of spatial objects whose esse is\npercipi (1966: 98). The core of the argument is as follows.\nFrom the premise that every (human) experience is such that it is\npossible for its subject to become aware of it and ascribe it to\nherself, we can infer that in every experience the subject must be\ncapable of distinguishing a recognitional component not wholly absorbed\nby, and thus distinct from, the item recognized (1966: 100). From this\nwe can infer that the subject must conceptualize her experiences in\nsuch a way so as to contain the basis for a distinction between a\nsubjective component – how the experienced item seems to the subject,\nand an objective component – how the item actually is. Strawson\nspecifies that “collectively,” this comes to “the\ndistinction between the subjective order and arrangement of a series of\nsuch experiences on the one hand, and the objective order and\narrangement of the items of which they are the experiences on the\nother” (1966: 101). Conceptualizing experience as involving an\nobjective order and arrangement of items amounts to making objectively\nvalid judgments about it, which, in turn, implies that experience must\nconsist of a rule-governed connectedness of representations (1966: 98).\nSummarizing, from a premise about self-consciousness, we can infer that\nthe subject must conceptualize her experience so as to feature a\ndistinction between “the subjective route of his experience and\nthe objective world through which it is a route,” where the\nexperience of the objective world consists in a rule-governed order of\nrepresentations (1966: 105). \n\nBarry Stroud, in his 1968 article “Transcendental\nArguments,” issued a formidable challenge to the enterprise of\ndefeating the external-world skeptic by transcendental arguments of\nthis sort (Stroud 1968). There Stroud contends that such transcendental\narguments are undermined by a problem which can be stated quite\ngenerally. These arguments feature reasoning from some aspect of\nexperience or knowledge to the claim that the contested feature of the\nexternal world in fact exists. In each case the existence of\nthe external feature will not be a necessary condition of the aspect of\nexperience or knowledge in question, for a belief about the\nexternal feature would always suffice. Although the claim about\nexistence of the aspect of the external world could be secured if\ncertain kinds of verificationism or idealism were presupposed, these\nviews are highly controversial. Besides, one could make as much of an\ninroad against the skeptic armed with the verificationism or idealism\nalone, without adducing the transcendental argument at all (cf.\nBrueckner 1983, 1984). \n\nAlthough Strawson’s transcendental argument in The Bounds of\nSense is not a specific target in Stroud’s (1968), Anthony\nBrueckner suggests that it is susceptible to the line of criticism\nthat Stroud develops (Brueckner 1983: 557–8). For, arguably,\nStrawson can only conclude that experience must be conceptualized in a\ncertain way, such as to allow the subject to make the distinction\nbetween an objective world and her subjective path through it. This is\nnot a conclusion about how a mind-independent world must be, but only\nabout how it must be thought. (Alternatively, Strawson might be read\nas drawing only a conclusion about how experience must be\nconceptualized, which would render the transcendental argument as one\nof a more modest variety (see below)). \nRecent developments of transcendental arguments reflect a struggle to\naccommodate Stroud’s criticism, and often chastened expectations\nabout what such arguments might establish by way of refuting\nskepticism. One more modest sort of transcendental argument begins with\na premise about experience or knowledge that is acceptable to the\nskeptic in question, and then proceeds not to the existence of some\naspect of the external world, but in accord with Stroud’s\ncriticism, to a belief in the existence of some aspect of the external\nworld. Stroud himself advocates a strategy of this sort (Stroud 1994,\n1999), as does Robert Stern (1999). The kind proposed by Stroud begins\nwith the premise that we think of the world as being independent of us,\nand it concludes, as a necessary condition of this premise, that we must\nthink of it as containing enduring particulars. Such an argument does\nnot claim that as a necessary condition of this premise there must\nexist such particulars. It contends only for “a connection solely\nwithin our thought: if we think in certain ways, we must think in\ncertain other ways” (Stern 1999: 165). A belief or thought to\nwhich one reasons in this way would, in Stroud’s conception, have\na certain indispensability, “because no belief that must\nbe present in any conception or any set of beliefs about an independent\nworld could be abandoned consistently with our conception of the world\nat all,” and it would be invulnerable “in the\nspecial sense that it could not be found to be false consistently with\nits being found to be held by people” (Stern 1999: 166). \nStern advances a conception of this kind of argument on which it\naddresses a skeptic who questions whether certain beliefs cohere with\nothers in one’s set, as opposed to a skeptic who questions whether\ncertain beliefs are true (Stern 1999). A modest transcendental\nargument would then aim to show that a belief whose coherence with the\nother beliefs is challenged so coheres after all. The requisite\ncoherence might be demonstrated by showing that the belief in question\nis actually a necessary condition of a belief that is indispensable\n(in some coherentist sense) to one’s set. Mark Sacks (1999) objects\nthat if at the same time one were to admit that the belief might not\nbe true, one’s sense that one is justified in holding the belief would\nbe undermined. This worry is a serious one. Sacks argues that it\narises because of a tension between the coherentist theory of\njustification and the realist correspondence theory of truth that the\nexternal world skeptic presupposes. One might respond, he points out,\nby accepting a coherence theory of truth as well, but this would be to\nadopt a version of idealism. Moreover, it seems that Sacks’s proposal\nwould not solve the problem, for the reason that even if one accepted\na coherence theory of truth, one would still have to admit that for\nspecific instances of a belief one might be mistaken, even if one\nmaintained that one was justified in holding that belief on grounds of\ncoherence. \nAn important criticism of Stroud’s proposed sort of modest\ntranscendental argument is raised by Brueckner (1996). Brueckner\naddresses the fit between the claim that certain non-skeptical beliefs\nare invulnerable in Stroud’s sense, and the admission that they\nmight not be true. More precisely, he challenges the claim that one can\nsimultaneously affirm the following two principles, each gleaned from\nStroud (1994): \n\nand \n\nBrueckner divides (SK) into \n\nand \n\nStroud argues, in effect, that given CT we cannot believe that (i) and\n(ii) are true, but nonetheless, we can believe that (i) and (ii) are\nlogically compossible given CT. Brueckner argues that using similar\nreasoning, given CT we cannot conceive of a possible world in which\nboth (i) and (ii) hold, and this fact undermines Stroud’s claim.  To\nconceive of a world W in which (i) is true is to conceive of a world\nin which we (in the actual world) attribute beliefs about\nmind-independent objects to counterfactual versions of us (CVs) in W.\nBut given CT, we must now also conceive of W as featuring\nmind-independent objects with which these CVs interact. Consider the\nCVs’ belief that there exist mind-independent objects – a \nbelief they share with us. This belief of theirs will be true. And\nthus in W (ii) will be false. Hence we have not conceived of a world\nin which given CT, SK is nevertheless true, and indeed, we will not be\nable to conceive of such a world. But our not being able to conceive\nof a possible world in which given CT, SK is true, constitutes strong\nevidence against the claim that SK is logically possible given CT\n(1996: 274–75). Brueckner does not think that this argument\ndemonstrates that it is inconsistent to accept CT and assert that SK\nis logically possible, but that there will be no evidence of the usual\nkind for this claim – evidence from conceivability. Thus given\nthe transcendental argument he advances, Stroud will be pushed in the\ndirection of the immodest conclusion that it is not possible for us to\nbe mistaken in our belief that there exist mind-independent\nobjects. \nFrom this one might be tempted to conclude that despite his critique of\n1968, Stroud, with Brueckner’s assistance, has found a\ntranscendental argument that does in fact establish a conclusion about\nthe external world. However, so far nothing has been said to turn back\nStroud’s 1968 critique, and it seems much more likely that the\nargument Stroud now advances can at best conclude with a version of CT\nin which the term “independent” must be read in a\ntranscendentally ideal sense – in which, for example, the nature of\ncertain physical objects is determined by our best scientific theories\nabout them, and our sensory experiences can be in error about these\nobjects. And if this is so, then the argument would secure a belief\nabout the external world only on the presupposition of metaphysical\nidealism, and this is one of the ways in which anti-skeptical\ntranscendental arguments might be doomed according to Stroud’s\n1968 critique. \n\nDespite these sorts of challenges, the aspiration to forge transcendental\narguments with considerable anti-skeptical force has not waned.\nQassim Cassam (1999), Sacks (2000), and Stern (2000), for\nexample, have developed creative and nuanced versions\nof transcendental arguments designed to negotiate the type of problem\nStroud has pressed. \n\nKant ethical writings (1785, 1788) feature several widely and\nintensely discussed transcendental arguments (see the\nentry Kant’s moral philosophy). \nAs in metaphysics and epistemology, in recent times\nanti-skeptical transcendental arguments have also been developed in\nthe practical sphere.\n \nOne of P. F. Strawson’s most influential works is his essay on moral\nresponsibility, “Freedom and Resentment” (Strawson 1962). The\nreasoning in this article has not traditionally been interpreted as a\ntranscendental argument, but recently Justin Coates has made a strong\ncase for such a reading (Coates 2016; cf. Pereboom 2016). In Coates’s\naccount, the argument begins with the premise to which the moral\nresponsibility skeptic would agree, that meaningful adult\ninterpersonal relationships are possible for us. It continues by\npointing out that relationships of this sort require that the\nparticipants show each other good will and respect, and that they be\njustified in expecting this of one another. Expectations for good will\nand respect in turn require susceptibility to the reactive attitudes,\nsuch as moral resentment, indignation, and gratitude, and in\nparticular, justified expectations for good will and respect\npresuppose that the participants are apt recipients of these reactive\nattitudes. But to be an apt target of the reactive attitudes is just\nwhat it is to be a morally responsible agent. Consequently, that we\nare morally responsible agents is a necessary condition of the\npossibility for us of meaningful adult interpersonal\nrelationships. \nNote that not all the connections among the steps of the argument are\nplausibly instances of appeals to logical or even metaphysical\nnecessary conditions. True, some are: if being an apt target of the\nreactive attitudes is what it is to be a morally responsible agent,\nthe necessary connection invoked would be conceptual or\nmetaphysical. But if expectations for good will and respect do require\nsusceptibility to the reactive attitudes, this would be plausibly a\ncase of nomological necessitation, where the relevant laws are\npsychological. But given the sort of skepticism targeted, nomological\nnecessitation is not too weak a connection; it is not called into\nquestion by the arguments of the moral responsibility skeptic. \nCritics have in effect taken issue with a number of steps of this\nargument, for example that expectations for good will and respect\nrequire susceptibility to the reactive attitudes, and that justified\nexpectations for good will and respect presuppose that the\nparticipants are apt recipients of the reactive attitudes. Perhaps\nhuman relationships do not require susceptibility to moral resentment\nand indignation, but only to the nonreactive attitudes of moral\nconcern, disappointment and sorrow (Pereboom 2014). Another avenue of\ncriticism involves separating moral responsibility from being an apt\ntarget of the reactive attitudes. It may be that a forward-looking,\nthat is, what Strawson calls an ‘optimistic’ notion of responsibility,\nis all that’s required for good relationships, and it is not\ncharacterized by being an apt target of the reactive attitudes. But\nthese criticisms are controversial, and Strawson’s argument is widely\naccepted and acclaimed. \nAnother prominent transcendental argument in the practical sphere is\nthe sort Christine Korsgaard (1996) develops for Kantian claim that we\nmust value ourselves as rational agents. Here is Robert Stern’s (2017)\nrepresentation of one argument of this sort. The initial premise\nconcerns rational choice, and crucially features the notion of an\nagent’s practical identity, the distinctive nature of a person as an\nagent, which may include, for example, being a parent or a philosophy\nprofessor: \nStern (2017) explains this argument as follows. To act is to do or\nchoose something for a reason. However, an agent has reasons to act\nonly because of her practical identity; she does not have reasons to\nact independently of that identity. But a practical identity can yield\nsuch a reason only if she regards that identity as valuable. Merely\nbeing a parent gives one no reason to care for one’s children. Rather,\nvaluing one’s parenthood has this force. At the same time, an agent\ncannot regard a particular practical identity as valuable in itself;\nKorsgaard argues that this sort of realism about value is\nimplausible. The only remaining explanation is that she regards it as\nvaluable because of the contribution it makes to providing her with\nreasons and values by which to live. But then she must believe that it\nmatters that her life has the sort of rational structure that having\nsuch identities provides. However, to see that as mattering, she must\nregard leading a rationally structured life as valuable. Then, in\nconclusion, to regard leading such a life as valuable, an agent must\nsee her rational nature as valuable.  \n\nThe legacy of the arguments such as the Transcendental Deduction and\nthe Refutation of Idealism includes not only Kant’s actual\nsuccesses, but also a number of influential philosophical strategies:\nthe now-standard tactic of arguing for concepts whose\nsource is in the mind from universal and necessary features of\nexperience; the idea of drawing significant philosophical conclusions\nfrom premises about self-consciousness alone; and the notion of a\ntranscendental argument, which from an uncontroversial premise about\nour thought, knowledge or experience, reasons to a substantive and\nunobvious presupposition and necessary condition of this claim.","contact.mail":"dp346@cornell.edu","contact.domain":"cornell.edu"}]
