Dilthey is best known for the way he distinguished\nbetween the natural and human sciences. He defined the human sciences\nbroadly to include both the humanities and the social sciences.\nWhereas the main task of the natural sciences as Dilthey found them\nwas to arrive at law-based causal explanations, he projected the core\ntask of the human sciences to be that of providing an understanding of\nthe organizational structures and dynamic forces of human and\nhistorical life. It will be shown that this distinction is not so\nsharp as to rule out causal explanations in particular human sciences\nsuch as psychology, political theory, and economics; it mostly\ndelimits the scope of explanations in these fields. Dilthey’s\naim was to expand Kant’s primarily nature-oriented Critique\nof Pure Reason into a Critique of Historical Reason that\ncan also do justice to the social and cultural dimensions of human\nexperience. Understanding the meaning of human historical events\nrequires being able to organize them in their proper contexts and to\narticulate the structural uniformities that can be found in this way.\nDilthey’s reflections on the human sciences, historical\ncontextualization, and hermeneutics influenced many subsequent\nthinkers such as Husserl, Heidegger, Cassirer, Gadamer and Ricoeur.\nRecently, there has been some attention given to the ways in which\nDilthey’s empirical approach to experience influenced Carnap in\nhis early attempts to overcome metaphysics in favor of more analytical\nmethods.\n\nWilhelm Dilthey was born in Biebrich on the Rhine in 1833, two years\nafter Hegel had died. Dilthey’s ambivalent attitude towards\nHegel can provide some initial clues about his own philosophical\napproach. He admired Hegel’s recognition of the historical\ndimension of philosophical thought, but rejected the speculative and\nmetaphysical ways he developed this relation. Like the Neo-Kantians,\nDilthey proposed a return to the more focused viewpoint of Kant, but\nnot without also taking account of the higher emancipatory aspirations\nand broader perspectives of later thinkers such as Fichte, Herder, and\nHegel. \nDilthey characterized his own expansive view of philosophy as one of\nestablishing integral relations to all the theoretical disciplines and\nhistorical practices that attempt to make sense of the world. Instead\nof demarcating the boundaries that set philosophy apart from other\nways of engaging life, Dilthey conceives its critical task as\narticulating the overall structures that define the human spirit in\ngeneral. Relatively early in his career, philosophy is defined as\n“an experiential science of spiritual phenomena” that\nseeks to “cognize the laws governing social, intellectual and\nmoral phenomena” (1867/GS.V, 27). Philosophy should aim to\npreserve the scope that idealists such as Fichte, Schelling and Hegel\nhad given it, but it must do so by recapturing the Kantian rigor that\nhad been lost and by proceeding empirically. \nThese goals, as formulated in the inaugural lecture that Dilthey gave\nin 1867 on assuming his first professorship in Basel, were already\nprefigured in his early journals. Thus in 1859 Dilthey wrote that a\nnew Critique of Reason must proceed on the basis of the psychological\nlaws and impulses from which art, religion and science all derive. All\nintellectual systems are mere crystallizations of more generic\nschemata rooted in life (JD, 80). \nThe early Dilthey conceived his goal as a broadening of the critical\nproject that would ground the human sciences as Kant had grounded the\nnatural sciences. His hope then was that the human sciences would be\nable to arrive at lawful explanations just like the natural sciences.\nUp until at least 1887, when he published his Poetics,\nDilthey was confident that inner explanations of human creativity\ncould be arrived at. He himself formulated three laws of the\nimaginative metamorphosis to account for the uplifting effect that\npoets can have on us. Dilthey summarizes them as the laws of\nexclusion, intensification, and completion. Even in ordinary\nexperience images are transformed by excluding what is no longer of\ninterest and intensifying what remains based on our present interests.\nBut what distinguishes poetic imagery is that it is also completed by\nthe overall life-concerns of a powerful psyche.  \nThrough his efforts to work out a kind of gestaltist\npsychology that could frame this third law of imaginative completion,\nDilthey came to modify some of his basic assumptions. He came to\nrealize that the overall psychic nexus of an individual was not a\nsufficient contextual frame to explain human experience. Our\nexperience can only be understood by describing it as it as a\ncontinuum that is gradually acquired over time. What he calls the\n“acquired psychic nexus” is itself historically embedded\nin a social world. This means that our access to history is much more\ndirect than our access to nature. We feel ourselves as part of history\nwhereas nature has come to increasingly stand apart from us. Although\nDilthey is still willing to accept that objects of outer experience\nare phenomenal, he no longer accepts the Kantian thesis that the\ncontents of inner experience are phenomenal as well. Inner experience\nis reconceived as lived experience (Erlebnis) that is real\nand the time that relates us to history is not merely the ideal form\nthat Kant had exposited for nature. \nThis second phase of Dilthey’s thought is characterized by a\nstress on the reality of lived experience and on the immediate\nunderstanding of human life that this makes possible. It is in the\n“Ideas for a Descriptive and Analytic Psychology” of 1894\nthat Dilthey works out his explanation-understanding distinction.\n“We explain through purely intellectual processes, but we\nunderstand through the cooperation of all the powers of the mind\nactivated by apprehension” (1894/SW.II, 147). The human sciences\nwill henceforth be conceived as primarily concerned with understanding\nthe meaning of human action and interaction. Also central to this\nsecond phase of Dilthey’s thought is the essay “The Origin\nof Our Belief in the Reality of the External World and Its\nJustification” of 1890. Our initial access to the external world\nis not inferential, but is felt as resistance to the will. The world\nof lived experience is not merely a theoretical representation, but is\ndirectly present to us as embodying values that are relevant to our\npurposes. The stress on feeling and immediacy in this second phase\namounts to a rejection of Hegel’s dialectical approach. \nIf the first phase was characterized by a search for inner\nexplanations and the second phase by direct understanding, the third\nphase can be characterized by the need for interpretation. This final\nphase can be said to span the last decade of Dilthey’s life\nuntil his death in 1911. It begins with the realization in the essay\n“The Rise of Hermeneutics” of 1900 that the inner\nintelligibility of lived experience does not yet constitute full\nunderstanding. Self-understanding must also be mediated from without.\nThe way we express ourselves, whether in communication or in action,\nis a crucial intermediary in defining ourselves. Understanding can\nonly be reliable if it proceeds through the interpretation of human\nobjectifications. Thus we properly understand ourselves not through\nintrospection but through historical contextualization. It is in this\nlast phase of his thought that Dilthey, who now occupied the chair\nthat Hegel had once held in Berlin, revives his predecessor’s\ntheory of objective spirit as the medium relating us to the past. In\n1906 Dilthey published a seminal work on the young Hegel –\nDie Jugendgeschichte Hegels – that made use of recently\ndiscovered theological and political fragments. These unknown early\nfragments disclosed Hegel’s historical geniality before it\nbecame constrained by the dialectical systematization that Dilthey had\nalways objected to. Dilthey’s student Herman Nohl was helpful in\ndeciphering some of these fragments and went on to publish them. Nohl\nalso edited a volume of Dilthey’s writings on the history of\nGerman Idealism going back to Kant, Beck and Fichte and leading up to\nsuch contemporaries of Hegel as Schelling, Schleiermacher,\nSchopenhauer and Fries. \nDilthey followed family tradition by starting his university studies\nat Heidelberg in theology. There he was also introduced to the\nphilosophical systems of the idealists by Kuno Fischer. Because\nFischer was accused of being a pantheist, his right to teach was\nwithdrawn in 1853. Dilthey then moved to the University of Berlin,\nwhere he came under the influence of two of Friedrich\nSchleiermacher’s students, Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg and\nAugust Boeckh. Increasingly, Schleiermacher became the focus of\nDilthey’s interests. In 1859 he was asked to complete the\nediting of Schleiermacher’s letters. That year the\nSchleiermacher Society also organized an essay competition.\nDilthey’s submission entitled “Schleiermacher’s\nHermeneutical System in Relation to Earlier Protestant\nHermeneutics” (1860, SW.IV, 33–227), was awarded the first\nprize and led to a second commission, namely, to write\nSchleiermacher’s biography. The first volume of this biography\nwas published in 1870. It places Schleiermacher not only in his\ntheological setting but also in the context of the literary and\nphilosophical movements astir in Berlin from 1796 to 1807. The work\ndisplays Dilthey’s own expanding interests in aesthetical and\nphilosophical issues. He also wrote his dissertation on\nSchleiermacher’s ethics. \nAs a theology student, Dilthey had begun a study of many early\nformulations of the Christian worldview, which though never completed,\ncontinued to influence his subsequent writings. In 1860 Dilthey writes\nthat  \nit is my calling to apprehend the innermost nature of religious life\nin history and to bring this to the attention of our times which are\nmoved exclusively by matters of state and science. (JD, 140)  \nThis means looking for religiosity not so much in its institutional\npractices and its theological doctrines as in the recesses of human\nexperience. In a similar vein, he asserts that it is necessary to\nrecover the “religious-philosophical worldview that is buried\nunder the ruins of our theology and philosophy” (JD, 140). \nDilthey conceives religious experience as an extension of\nSchleiermacher’s feeling of absolute dependence. It is a total\nexperience that interweaves a feeling of dependence with an awareness\nof a capacity to uplift ourselves. Religious experience is regarded as\nan enduring background and accompaniment of human intellectual life.\nReligion has manifested itself in many forms such as mythical\nrepresentations, mystical ideas of revelation and human redemption,\ntheological doctrines, and metaphysical theories. Because of its\nemphasis on meteorological events (1883/ SW I, 450), Dilthey saw myth\nas a primitive scientific theory that compromised the genuine\nreligiosity of mystical feelings. \nLater as he reflected on the nature of worldviews, Dilthey would\noccasionally return to the problem of religion. What distinguishes the\nreligious worldview from artistic and philosophical worldviews is that\nit relates the visible to what is invisible, life to our awareness of\ndeath. In a striking late passage, Dilthey writes that when life is\nexperienced religiously and  \naccording to its true nature—full of hardships and a singular\nblend of suffering and happiness throughout—<we are>\npointed to something strange and unfamiliar, as if it were coming from\ninvisible sources, something <pressing in> on life from outside,\nyet coming from its own depths. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 285) \nThe same non-transcendent perspective on religion is to be found in\nDilthey’s last essay, written during the final days of his life\nin 1911 while he was on vacation in the Dolomites. This essay on\n“The Problem of Religion” points to the fact that the\nEnlightenment has made it increasingly difficult to acknowledge the\nmystical aspects of religious experience. Enlightenment thinkers\nregarded mystical experience as irrational. But according to Dilthey,\nSchleiermacher was able to avoid this charge of irrationalism by\nrelating core aspects of religious experience to the insights of\ntranscendental philosophy. Instead of interpreting the mystical\nfeeling of communion as an esoteric union with a transcendent God,\nSchleiermacher explicates it as a general awareness that is attuned to\nthe invisible coherence of things down here (1911/SW.VI,304–05).\nHe gives a transcendental reading of what is intuited and felt in the\nreligious mood by transforming it into a creative life-principle.\nWhereas traditionally mysticism tended to devalue our life in this\nworld, Schleiermacher’s mysticism is seen as affirming it. \nDilthey’s first major theoretical work is the Introduction\nto the Human Sciences of 1883. The human sciences\n(Geisteswissenschaften) encompass both the humanities and the\nsocial sciences. They range from disciplines like philology, literary\nand cultural studies, religion and psychology, to political science\nand economics. Dilthey insists that the human sciences be related not\nby some logical construct on the order of August Comte or J.S. Mill,\nbut by means of reflective considerations that take their historical\ngenesis into account. Dilthey writes that  \nthe human sciences as they exist and as they are practiced according\nto the reason of things that were active in their history …\ncontain three classes of assertions. (1883/SW.I, 78)  \nThese are 1) descriptive and historical statements, 2) theoretical\ngeneralizations about partial contents and 3) evaluative judgments and\npractical rules. The human sciences are more obviously normative in\nnature than the natural sciences for which formal norms related to\nobjective inquiry suffice. The fact that the human sciences are forced\nto confront substantive normative issues puts a limit on the kind of\ntheoretical regularities that can be established in the human\nsciences. Given the core role that human beings play in the\nsocio-historical world, the understanding of individuality is as\nimportant in the human sciences as are the explanations to be found\nthrough generalizations. \nBut the human science of psychology that deals with individual human\nbeings cannot examine them apart from interactions with society.\n“Man as a fact prior to history and society is a fiction”\n(1883/SW.I, 83). This means that psychology can be a foundational\nhuman science only if it is conceived as being primarily descriptive.\nPsychological explanations may still be possible, but only by starting\nwith a non-hypothetical base that describes how our experience\nassimilates social and cultural features. Many human character traits\nare not purely psychological. Thus when we speak of a person as\nthrifty we are combining economic and psychological features. \nIndividual human beings are important for the understanding of\nhistory, but instead of making them the monadic building blocks of\nhistory, they are to be considered as points of intersection of many\nforces. Only a multidisciplinary approach to human history can do it\njustice. Qua conscious living beings, individuals are the\ncarriers of history, but they are just as much the products of\nhistory. Individuals are not self-sufficient atoms. But neither are\nthey to be regarded as swallowed up by encompassing communities like\nnations or peoples. Concepts that posit the soul of a people\n“are no more usable in history than is the concept of life-force\nin physiology” (1883/SW.I, 92). Suspicion of those who posit\noverriding self-sufficient entities like nations and peoples led\nDilthey to distance himself from the nationalism of his contemporary\nHeinrich von Treitschke and to ally himself with a political reformism\nreminiscent of Kant and Wilhelm von Humboldt. \nDilthey conceives of most of the human sciences as analyzing human\ninteractions at a level that can mediate between individual initiative\nand communal tradition. These sciences deal with what he calls\n“cultural systems” and “external organizations of\nsociety”. Cultural systems are associations that individuals\njoin voluntarily for certain purposes that they can only achieve\nthrough cooperation. These systems are cultural in the widest possible\nsense and include all aspects of our social life. They can be\npolitical, economic, artistic, scientific or religious in nature and\nare not normally bound by national or other overarching interests.\nExternal organizations of society by contrast are those more\ncontrolling institutional structures like a family and a state that we\nare born into. Here “enduring causes bind the wills of many into\na single whole” (1883/SW.I, 94) within which relations of power,\ndependence and property can be established. It is important to\ncross-reference cultural systems and institutional organizations.\nEnlightenment thinkers had focused on cultural systems such as\nscientific academies and their potential universal scope while\noverlooking how most educational institutions are controlled by local\nauthorities. Although Dilthey received his training from members of\nthe Historical School, he recognized that many of them had been\nequally one-sided by stressing the distinctive institutional\norganizations that separate different peoples while ignoring the role\nof generalizations made possible through the analysis of cultural\nsystems. \nDilthey aims to combine these two approaches to liberalize the\nhistoricist perspective and give it a methodological rigor. To\nunderstand the role of the law in historical life we must consider it\nboth as a cultural system that frames legal issues in universal terms\nand as an external organization of society that examines them in terms\nof the positive laws of particular institutions. The Historical School\nwas wrong to regard individuals as completely subordinate to the bonds\nof family and state and to think that the positive laws of\ninstitutions define the full reality of life. The authority of the\nstate “encompasses only a certain portion … of the\ncollective power of the populace” and even when state power\nexerts a certain preponderance it can do so only “through the\ncooperation of psychological impulses” (1883/SW.I, 132). \nIn the preface to the Introduction to the Human Sciences,\nDilthey refers to his project as a Critique of Historical Reason. We\ncan now see that this is first of all a critique of the metaphysical\nthesis that there can be an overarching “universal explanatory\nframework for all historical facts” (1883/SW.I, 141). If\nuniversal explanations are to be possible for history as well as for\nnature, then we must recognize that they are only possible for\ncorrelating partial contents of reality. The reason that the natural\nsciences have been so successful in discovering causal laws of nature\nis that they abstract from the full scope of the external world.  \nThe conditions sought by the mechanistic explanation\nof nature explain only part of the contents of external\nreality. This intelligible world of atoms, ether, vibrations, is\nonly a calculated and highly artificial abstraction from what is given\nin outer and lived experience. (1883/SW.I, 203)  \nThe human sciences cannot similarly construct an abstract phenomenal\nworld that focuses on physical and chemical processes and appeals to\nhypothetical atomic or even subatomic elements. It is incumbent on the\nhuman sciences to deal with the more complex networks of the\nhistorical world and the actual givens of human beings. Explanations\nthat are adequate for the historical world will require an analysis of\nthe multiple partial contents that are relevant in a particular\ncontext. According to Dilthey the human sciences must replace the\nabstract methodology of the natural sciences with an analytic\ncounterpart.  \nAbstraction is distinguished from analysis in that the former singles\nout one fact and disregards the others, whereas the latter\nseeks to apprehend the majority of the facts that make up the factors\nof a complex whole. (ca. 1880–1893/SW.I, 433)  \nThe more facts that explanations seek to correlate, the more limited\ntheir scope must be. Thus the laws to be discovered in the human\nsciences will apply not to history in general, but only to specific\ncultural systems or institutional organizations. It may be possible to\narrive at causal laws of economic growth, of scientific progress or of\nliterary development, but not at overarching historical laws of human\nprogress. \nSo far Dilthey has argued for a relative independence of the human\nsciences vis-à-vis the better established natural\nsciences. However, from the transcendental perspective that considers\nthe conditions our consciousness brings to experience, the human\nsciences must claim a reflective priority. The realization that the\nhuman sciences not only ascertain what is—as do the natural\nsciences—but also make value judgments, establish goals and\nprescribe rules, discloses that they are much more directly related to\nthe full reality of lived experience. The Kantian I-think that is the\nbasis of the conceptual cognition (Erkenntnis) of the natural\nsciences really derives from a direct knowing (Wissen) rooted\nin Dilthey’s more inclusive thinking-feeling-willing of lived\nexperience (see 1883/SW.I, 228, and ca. 1880–93/SW.I,\n263–68). The natural sciences merely construct a phenomenal or\nideal world that abstracts from the real nexus of lived experience.\nThe world that is formed by the human sciences is the\nhistorical-social reality in which human beings participate. It is a\nreal world that is directly possessed or present in what Dilthey calls\nInnewerden. This term has sometimes been translated as\n“inner awareness,” but is is better to translate it as\n“reflexive awareness” to indicate how things are\nthere-for-us. Reflexive awareness is a pre-reflective, indexical mode\nof consciousness that “does not place a content over against the\nsubject of consciousness (it does not re-present it)” (ca.\n1880–93/SW.I, 253). It is the direct know-how that reality is\npresent-for-me prior to any of the reflective act-content,\ninner-outer, or subject-object distinctions that characterize the\nrepresentational world of conceptual cognition. \nThe human sciences must hold on to the original presence of this\ndirectly known reality even as they proceed to use the intellectual\ntools of conceptual cognition in their analysis of partial contents.\nThe way the historical world is represented and analyzed must in some\nway still reflect the way history has been lived. The final\nunderstanding (Verstehen) aimed at by Dilthey’s human\nsciences must draw on all our capacities and is to be distinguished\nfrom the mere intellectual and abstract understanding\n(Verstand) of Kant’s natural sciences.  \nIn attempting to convey the richness and depth of lived experience,\nthe human sciences must also consider the contribution of the arts.\nAesthetics constitutes an important cultural system in that it can\nprovide a sense of how the arts can contribute to human understanding\nin general. Dilthey’s Poetics of 1887 represents an\neffort to develop certain psychological concepts to explicate the\nworkings of the poetic imagination. Even in ordinary life, the images\nwe extract from experience are subject to metamorphosis. With time all\nour images are transformed, for “the same image can no more\nreturn than the same leaf can grow back on a tree the following\nspring” (1887/SW.V, 102). The first law of metamorphosis\ninvolves the exclusion of those constituents of images that are not\nvaluable to us. Not every apprehended constituent is worth\nremembering. According to Dilthey we do not just passively absorb\nevery impression that comes our way. We filter out what is not worth\nperceiving by a process of apperception. This apperception is guided\nby what is called an “acquired nexus of psychic life”.\nBecause this gradually acquired nexus differs for each subject, the\nprocess of exclusion never has the same outcome. \nSome of what has not been excluded by the first law of imaginative\nmetamorphosis can then become the focus of special attention.\nAccording to Dilthey’s second law of imaginative metamorphosis\n“Images are transformed when they expand or contract, when the\nintensity of the sensations of which they are composed is increased or\ndecreased” (1887/SW.V, 102). Such a change in intensity can\napply to either the reproductive imagination of ordinary memory or the\nproductive imagination of poets or novelists. In the former case of\nmemory an increase of intensity tends to be as much a function of a\npresent practical interest as of acquired experience. In the latter\ncase of the imagination of poets an increase of intensity is more\nlikely to be primarily regulated by their overall acquired psychic\nnexus. What distinguishes the imagination of great poets according to\nDilthey is their capacity to ignore the constant distractions and\nmundane interests of daily life. Only they can unfold imagery in a way\nthat reflects our overall human values. \nThe third law of imaginative metamorphosis involves their completion,\nby which Dilthey means a process “by which something outer is\nenlivened by something inner or something inner is made visible and\nintuitable by something outer” (1887/SW.V, 104). In completion\nthere is an interpenetration between inner feeling and outer\nperception so that the very nucleus of an image can symbolize the\noverall acquired psychic nexus. Dilthey writes,  \nOnly when the whole acquired psychic nexus becomes active can\nimages be transformed on the basis of it: innumerable,\nimmeasurable, almost imperceptible changes occur in their\nnucleus. And in this way, the completion of the particular originates\nfrom the fullness of psychic life. (1887/SW.V, 104) \nThis last law of imaginative completion applies only to artists and\nallows them to articulate the essential meaning of\nlife-situations—through them we come to see what is typical in\nlife. These laws of metamorphosis are conceived as explanative to the\nextent that they appeal to an overall acquired psychic nexus as their\nultimate context. But a more comprehensive descriptive account shows\nthese laws to be rather schematic and unable to capture all the\nqualitative changes that result for our understanding of the world\nmore generally. And for that reason Dilthey backs away from pure\npsychological explanations after 1887. In the essay “Three\nEpochs of Modern Aesthetics” of 1892 he redescribes imaginative\nmetamorphosis more structurally. A portrait painter is said to order\nthe structure of what is objectively perceived  \naround one especially noticeable point, which I will call the\naesthetic point of impression. Every carefully observed face is\nunderstood on the basis of such a dominant impression …. On the\nbasis of this impression and repeated memory, indifferent features are\nexcluded, while telling features are stressed and refractory ones\nde-emphasized. The remaining whole is unified ever more decisively.\n(1892/SW.V, 217)  \nNow exclusion, intensification and unifying completion are understood\nas part of a process of articulating the structure of our experience\nof reality. \nThis new, more descriptive structural approach is inaugurated in the\nessay “The Origin of Our Belief in the Reality of the External\nWorld and Its Justification” of 1890. Here Dilthey writes that\nthe structure of all psychic life consists of impressions\n“evoking purposive reactions in the system of our drives and the\nfeelings connected with them” (1890a/SW.II, 14). Rather than\nbasing our initial sense of an external world on theoretical\ninferences from effects to causes, he roots it in a felt resistance to\nthe will. But resistance must be internalized as a restraint of a\nvolitional intention for it to signify the existence of something\nindependent. Thus Dilthey is not merely replacing a representational\nphenomenalism with a direct perceptual realism. Each perceptual\nprocess has “an inner side” that involves “an energy\nand affective tone deriving from inner strivings that connect it to\nour own life” (1890a/SW.II, 14). All aspects of our own life are\nbrought into play as we respond to the world. \nIn 1894 Dilthey published his “Ideas for a Descriptive and\nAnalytic Psychology” and established how it differs from\ntraditional explanative psychologies. He admits that even a\ndescriptive psychology will seek to explicate the causal relationships\nof life, but that it must differ from explanative psychology by not\ntrying to “derive a comprehensive and transparent cognition of\npsychological phenomena from a limited number of univocally determined\nelements” (1894/SW.II, 116). Unlike the associationists, Dilthey\nwill not posit simple, stable impressions that are then combined into\nmore complex ideas. They introduce unnecessary hypothetical elements\ninto the foundation of psychology.  \nIn psychology it is precisely the connectedness that is originally and\ncontinually given in lived experience: life presents itself everywhere\nonly as a continuum or nexus. (1894/SW.II, 119–20)  \nIt is the task of a descriptive and analytic psychology to explicate\nhow different processes converge in the nexus of consciousness. This\nnexus is lived and must be distinguished from the overall acquired\npsychic nexus discussed earlier. The lived nexus is available to\nreflexive awareness and can be described as itself an ongoing process.\nAnalysis then shows this process to have a rather uniform\ncross-sectional structure. Almost every momentary state of\nconsciousness can be seen “to simultaneously contain some kind\nof representing, feeling, and willing” (1894/SW.II, 173). \nIf we were merely representational beings, the conditions of psychic\nlife would be merely causal. But we at the same time estimate the\nvalue of what we represent through feeling.  \nOnce external conditions evoke a sense of pressure or intensification\nin the sphere of feeling, a striving comes about to either maintain or\nto modify a given state. (1894/SW.II, 177)  \nThe interest of feeling that attaches to aspects of what is\nexperienced allows us to value them as either favorable or unfavorable\nto our existence and sets the stage for the will to possibly act on\ntheir basis. \nTo the extent that the parts [of the experiential nexus] are connected\nstructurally so as to link the satisfaction of the drives and\nhappiness and to reject suffering, we call this nexus purposive. It is\nsolely in psychic structure that the character of purposiveness is\noriginally given, and when we attribute this to an organism or to the\nworld, this concept is only transferred from inner lived experience.\nEvery relation of parts to a whole attains the character of\npurposiveness from the value that is realized in it. This value is\nexperienced only in the life of feelings and drives. (1894/SW.II,\n178) \nPsychic life is not constructed synthetically from discrete elements,\nbut is always already a continuum that is constantly differentiating\nitself from within. By describing and analyzing this continuum Dilthey\nbrings out the breadth and depth of its scope and articulates it as a\nstructural nexus. And as he considers the temporal development of this\nnexus, he further defines its purposiveness. Although the cognitive\nand volitional subsystems of mental life may posit external ends, the\naffective and overall psychic nexus displays what Kant called a\npurposiveness without a determinant purpose. The overall acquired\npsychic nexus exhibits a teleology that does not posit any final\ntelos to which all previous stages are to be subsumed. The\npurposiveness of mental life is immanent and adaptive rather than\nexternal and predetermined. Each stage of our life can be understood\nas an epoch with its distinctive value. \nA further task of Dilthey’s descriptive and analytic psychology\nis to show how the development of the psychic nexus produces the\nindividuation of human life. Individuality is not conceived in terms\nof unique qualities that we are endowed with, but as something that\neach of us acquires historically. It is embodied in what was referred\nto earlier as a subject’s acquired psychic nexus and is only\ngradually articulated. Even when people share the same qualities their\nrelative intensity will differ. Sometimes qualities are present to\nsuch a small extent as to be, in effect, unnoticeable. Prominent\nqualities, however, tend to reinforce certain related qualities and\nsuppress others. Each individual can thus be understood as a\nstructural configuration of a set of dominant qualities in tension\nwith some subordinate qualities. This tension may be unresolved for a\nlong time until finally some articulation or Gestalt is\nreached that defines a person’s character. Dilthey gives the\nexample of strong ambition leading someone to gradually overcome\nshyness in public. Once a person recognizes that low self-confidence\nwhen speaking in public stands in the way of an important goal being\nfulfilled, that person can begin to cultivate the requisite\nqualities. \nThe initial response to Dilthey’s descriptive psychology was\nmixed. Hermann Ebbinghaus wrote an extended review which claimed that\nDilthey still relies on hypotheses and that the differences between\nexplanative and descriptive psychologies are minimal. Dilthey defended\nhis position by showing that he never meant to banish explanative\nhypotheses from psychology altogether, merely from its descriptive\nfoundations. Husserl later expressed his regret that the Ebbinghaus\nreview deflected him from reading this “genial”\nanticipation of phenomenology until much later. \nAnother kind of criticism came from the Neo-Kantians, most of whom\nwanted to completely divorce philosophy from psychology. In 1894 the\nBaden School Neo-Kantian Wilhelm Windelband delivered a lecture in\nwhich he claimed that psychology has no real relevance for the\nhistorical sciences and should be considered a natural science rather\nthan a human science. Windelband sees psychology as searching for laws\njust as the natural sciences do and historical studies as interested\nin unique patterns. Thus he proposed that the natural sciences are\nnomothetic and the historical or cultural sciences ideographic.\nDilthey in turn rejected Windelband’s distinction by showing\nthat many natural sciences have ideographic elements and many human\nsciences such as linguistics and economics have nomothetic aims.\nMoreover, Dilthey argued that the description of singular historical\ndata only becomes meaningful if understood in the framework of\nregularities: “What is most characteristic of the systematic\nhuman sciences is the connection of the general and the\nindividual ” (1895–6/SW.II, 227). Not only is it the\ncase that universal considerations are as important as ideographic\nspecificity, but also the understanding of individuality is not\npossible without reference to some broader context. \nThe final phase of Dilthey’s philosophy can be said to begin at\nthe turn of the twentieth century with his essay “The Rise of\nHermeneutics”. Whereas the early prize-essay on\nSchleiermacher’s hermeneutics had been more focused on textual\nand theological interpretation, the new essay makes hermeneutics a\nconnecting link between philosophy and history. Dilthey argues that\nthe study of history can be reliable only if it is possible to raise\nthe understanding of what is singular to the level of universal\nvalidity. Here he also comes to the realization that  \nthe inner experience through which I obtain reflexive awareness of my\nown condition can never by itself bring me to a consciousness of my\nown individuality. I experience the latter only through a comparison\nof myself with others. (1900/SW.IV, 236)  \nOthers cannot be assumed to be mere extensions of myself. They are\naccessible to me only from the outside. It is the task of\nunderstanding to confer “an inside” to what is first given\nas “a complex of external sensory signs” (1900/SW.IV,\n236). \nWhereas up to then the intelligibility of lived experience had been\nassumed to provide us an understanding of ourselves, now Dilthey\nasserts that we can understand ourselves only by means of our\nobjectifications. The understanding of self requires me to approach\nmyself as others do, that is, from the outside to the inside.  \nThe process of understanding, insofar as it is determined by common\nconditions and epistemological means, must everywhere have the same\ncharacteristics. (1900/SW.IV, 237)  \nTo the extent that rules can guide the understanding of the\nobjectifications of life they make possible a theory of\ninterpretation. Hermeneutics is the theory of interpretation that\nrelates to all human objectifications—that is, not only speech\nand writing, but also visual artistic expressions, more casual\nphysical gestures as well as observable actions or deeds. \nThis new hermeneutic perspective that approaches the inside from the\noutside also alters Dilthey’s conception of psychic structure.\nIn the first of three “Studies Toward the Foundation of the\nHuman Sciences” dating from 1904–9, Dilthey considers what\nlinguistic expressions can teach us about the intentionality of\nconsciousness. No longer merely explicating the breadth of psychic\nlife through the interweavings of acts of cognition, feeling and\nwilling, Dilthey uses expressions such as “I am worried about\nsomething” to disclose the referential structure of a lived\nexperience. Psychic acts have contents that are related to the objects\nof the world by means of what Dilthey calls attitudinal stances. These\njudgmental attitudes toward the world are  \nindefinite in number. Asking, believing, presuming, claiming, taking\npleasure in, approving, liking and its opposite, wishing, desiring,\nand willing are such modifications of the psychic attitude.\n(1904–9/SW.III, 43)  \nThese attitudinal and judgmental stances are not just cognitive, but\npre-delineate something more encompassing, which can be called\n“reflective knowledge” to distinguish it from the direct\nknowing of lived experience and reflexive awareness. This judgmental\nreflective knowledge (Wissen) adds to the conceptual\ncognition (Erkenntnis) of reality a “positing of\nvalues” and “the determination of purposes and the\nestablishment of rules.” (1904–9/SW.III, 25) \nWhile the kind of epistemology (Erkenntnistheorie)\nestablished by Kant and others suffices for the natural sciences, the\nhuman sciences require a more full-blooded theory of knowledge\n(Theorie des Wissens). Knowledge is to be\n“distinguished from a mere representation, presumption,\nquestion, or assumption by the fact that a content appears here with a\nsense of objective necessity” (1904–9/SW.III,\n27–28). This objective necessity is to be located in the\nevidentness that accompanies thinking that is properly executed and\nreaches its goal whether through the self-given reality of lived\nexperience or the “givenness that binds us to an outer\nperception” (1904–9/SW.III, 28). \nFor the human sciences, things in the world are not merely cognitively\napprehended as phenomenal objects, but known as real for our\nlife-concerns (Lebensbezüge). Thinking of the unfinished\nmanuscripts in his office, Dilthey writes in the Second Study Toward\nthe Foundation of the Human Sciences: \nEvery attempt to characterize a lived experience leads beyond it to\nother structurally related experiences that ground it. This involves\nnot just an observational process of willful attention, but also an\ninvoluntary “being-pulled-along by the state of affairs\nitself” (1904–9/SW.III, 51) to other constituent parts of\nthe nexus of human knowledge. \nSome of these refinements incorporated into Dilthey’s\ndescriptive program were inspired by reading Husserl’s\nLogical Investigations (1900–01). Dilthey specifically\nfollows Husserl in his account of how language contributes to\n“significative apprehension” (1904–9/SW.III, 60). In\nreading words we do not represent them as mere sets of letters but\nfulfill their meaning by representing their objects. There is a\ntriadic structural relation between the intuitive content of a\nlinguistic expression, an act that gives it meaning, and the object\nthat embodies that meaning as what is expressed. But whereas\nHusserl’s phenomenology focused in the conceptual structures of\nobjective apprehension, Dilthey gives equal attention to the felt\nstructures of what he calls “objective having”\n(1904–9/SW.III, 66). In objective apprehension we progress from\nattitude to objects, in objective having we regress from objects to\nattitude. This regressive turn from the outside to the inside is\nbrought to bear on how feelings are to be interpreted. “ Whether\nwe feel our own state or some object, it involves only a state of\nbeing as a kind of attitude…. The way this state of being\ndepends on outer objects or on the state of the subject is obscured\nthrough an inverse attitude that loses itself in the depth of the\nsubject” (1904–9/SW.III, 69). Instead of regarding\nfeelings merely as subjective states such as pleasure or displeasure,\nthey can be interpreted as attitudes that assess what is given in\nconsciousness as either furthering or diminishing one’s state of\nbeing in the world. Feelings can be added to our earlier list of\nattitudes. \nFeelings as attitudes allow us to evaluate the world. Our values\nexpress adjudicative attitudes based on feeling. Although the setting\nof purposes is grounded in the lived experience of values, the life of\nfeelings has an immanent teleology that does not require it to go over\ninto the desire to act. The structural nexus of willing is thus\ndifferent from that of feeling. There are many feelings that evoke\nfurther feelings rather than the impulse to do something in response\nto them. A feeling of suffering can for instance elicit a kind of\nself-pity that spreads the suffering and elicits a\n“distinctively mellow” (1904–9/SW.III, 76) mood that\nimmobilizes. \nThe final general attitude relevant to the structural nexus of\nknowledge is that of willing. In the lived experiences of willing\n“we possess a reflexive awareness of an intention to realize a\nstate of affairs” (1904–9/SW.III, 82). If we call this\nstate of affairs to be realized a “purpose” then what is\nexpected from this purpose is a satisfaction of some kind. \nDilthey’s most important work is The Formation\n(Aufbau) of the Historical World in the Human Sciences\nof 1910. Here Dilthey applies the same kind of structural analysis\nthat we saw him develop for lived experience to the understanding of\nhistory. The human sciences give form to the historical world by\nanalyzing the structural systems in terms of which human beings\nparticipate in history. In the Introduction to the Human\nSciences Dilthey had conceived the psychic nexus, cultural\nsystems and external organizations of society as purposive systems.\nNow a more neutral covering concept is used to capture all the ways\nthe forces of life can converge. This is the concept of the\n“productive nexus or system”\n(Wirkungszusammenhang). Now the efficacy of life and of the\nhistorical world is to be understood in terms of productivity before\nany causal or teleological analysis is applied. The carriers of\nhistory, whether they be individuals, cultures, institutions, or\ncommunities, are productive systems capable of producing value,\nmeaning, and, in some cases, realizing purposes. Each is to be\nconsidered structurally as centered in itself. \nIndividuals can be studied as psychic productive systems inherently\nrelated to each other as well as to more inclusive productive systems\nthat are also at work in history. These larger productive systems come\nabout because of the need for communication, interaction, and\ncooperation among individuals. But they can also take on a life of\ntheir own and survive the individuals that formed and shaped them.\nDilthey’s category of Wirkung or productivity is at the\nroot of Gadamer’s theory of the productive history\n(Wirkungsgeschichte) of works of art that grants them new\nmeanings over time that exceed those intended by their creators. In\nthe Introduction to the Human Sciences, Dilthey had been\nunwilling to consider purposive social systems as subjects or carriers\nof history. In The Formation of the Historical World in the Human\nSciences, he qualifies his opposition to the idea of a\ntranspersonal subject such as the soul of a people by de-reifying it\nas the spirit of a people that is to be considered as a logical rather\nthan a real subject. It is possible to regard cooperative productive\nsystems as logical subjects that transcend individuals without\npositing them as super-empirical real subjects. \nDespite this increased importance granted to more encompassing\ncultural systems and organizations of society, Dilthey continues to\ninsist that the individuals participating in them are never completely\nsubmerged by them. This is because any such productive system only\nengages some aspects of an individual. Moreover, the individuals\nactive in a cultural system often put their stamp on its mode of\nproductivity so that not just the rationally agreed upon function of\nthe system is achieved. Summing up these two points, Dilthey discerns\na difficulty in conceptualizing the sciences of these cultural systems\nin terms of the idea of purposes alone: \nIndividuals give only part of themselves to these more inclusive\nsystems, yet they can express their whole being through this part. No\ncultural system will embody merely the purposes it was meant to\nfulfill. That is why it is crucial to reconceive purposive systems as\nproductive systems. A productive nexus or system may be purposive in a\ngeneral sense without fulfilling a determinate purpose. It is to be\nunderstood more generally as producing objectifications that express\nhuman values as well as purposes—leaving open the extent to\nwhich specific goals are achieved. The important thing is how human\nvalues and purposes are expressed in productive systems and how their\nmeaning is to be understood. \nAs in the essay “The Rise of Hermeneutics”, understanding\nwas said to involve a process of referring back from outer sensory\nphenomena to a reality that involves inner processes. But now in\nThe Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences\nDilthey recognizes that this inner reality need not be psychological\nin nature. He uses the example of how the statutes of a state express\nthe common will of a community. The inner content of the laws on the\nbooks is a legal meaning-formation. The expressions we read in law\nbooks articulate an inner relation among legal imperatives. What is\nexpressed in these laws is not the mental states of individual\nlegislators, but a general way of regulating human relations. Dilthey\nmakes the same claim for individual poetic creations. What is\nexpressed in a drama is  \nnot the inner processes in the poet; it is rather a nexus created in\nthem but separable from them. The nexus of a drama consists in a\ndistinctive relation of material, poetic mood, motif, plot, and means\nof presentation. (1910/SW.III, 107) \nThe interpretation of history must deal with all manifestations of\nlife, not merely expressions that are intended to communicate a state\nof mind. In the section entitled “The Understanding of Other\nPersons and Their Manifestations of Life”, Dilthey distinguishes\nthree classes of life-manifestations. The first class consists of\nconcepts, judgments and larger thought-formations. They are intended\nto communicate states of affairs, not states of mind. Thus the\nproposition “two plus two equals four” means the same in\nall contexts and says nothing about the person uttering it. Actions\nform a second class of manifestations of life. Actions as such are not\nmeant to communicate anything, but they often do reveal something\nabout the intentions of the actor. Thus if someone picks up a hammer\nnearby some nails and wooden boards, it is legitimate to assume that\nhe or she wants to assemble the boards into some artifact. If this\noccurs in a large workshop, it is also plausible to think the person\nis a carpenter. This might also tell us something about the\nperson’s livelihood, but not much more. There is a third class\nof life-manifestations that Dilthey calls “expressions of lived\nexperience” and which disclose more about the individual\nuttering them. Expressions of lived experience can range from\nemotional exclamations and gestures to personal self-descriptions and\nreflections to works of art. Often these expressions are more\nrevealing than was intended: \nA work of art is often more disclosive of human life in general than\nof the specific life of the artist. It may disclose something about\nthe state of mind or the attitude of the artist, but a work of art\nwill only be great if its “spiritual content is liberated from\nits creator” (ca. 1910/SW.III, 228). \nAfter having analyzed these three kinds of manifestations of life,\nwhich can be called theoretical, practical and disclosive\nrespectively, Dilthey proceeds to distinguish various modes of\nunderstanding them. Elementary understanding goes back to the\nassociative relation that normally exists between an expression and\nwhat is expressed in it. It assimilates the meanings that are commonly\nattached to expressions in the community that we grow up in. Dilthey\nadapts Hegel’s idea of “objective spirit” to account\nfor this commonality of meaning. Now objective spirit logically\nencompasses “the manifold forms in which a commonality existing\namong individuals has objectified itself in the world of the\nsenses”, allowing the past to become “a continuously\nenduring present for us” (ca. 1910/SW.III, 229). Whereas Hegel\nrestricted objective spirit to the legal, economic and political\naspects of historical life, Dilthey expands the concept to include not\nonly the sciences, but also the triad of art, religion and philosophy\nthat Hegel had assigned to absolute spirit. But most of all, objective\nspirit embodies the everyday, mundane aspects of life that we grow up\nwith. \nThis common background suffices for the elementary understanding of\neveryday life. But whenever the common meaning of life-manifestations\nis called into question for some reason, higher understanding becomes\nnecessary. This can occur because of an apparent inconsistency among\nvarious claims being made, or because an ambiguity that needs to be\nresolved. In each case we discern an unexpected complexity that\nrequires us to shift our frame of reference. Higher understanding\ncannot continue to rely on the common meanings of an expression that\nderive from a shared local background between speaker and listener,\nwriter and reader. Higher understanding must replace the sphere of\ncommonality, where inference by analogy suffices, with that of\nuniversality, where inductive inference must take over. Here the human\nsciences become relevant by offering the appropriate universal\ndisciplinary contexts that can help to deal with uncertainties of\ninterpretation. These universal systematic contexts can be social or\npolitical, economic or cultural, secular or religious. When\nexpressions can be determined to be functioning in a specific\ndisciplinary context then ambiguities tend to disappear. Literary\nscholars may be able to clarify a puzzling poetic passage by showing\nit to contain a literary allusion to a classical work with a foreign\nvocabulary. Or they can perhaps clarify it by seeing it as a way of\naccommodating certain technical demands of the genre as such. These\ncases of higher understanding establish a larger context of\nreference. \nHowever, higher understanding can also focus on more specific contexts\nrelated to a work or its author. The consideration of such contexts\nshould come only at the conclusion of the interpretive process and\nrepresents a shift from exploring the relation “of expression to\nwhat is expressed” toward the relation “of what has been\nproduced to productivity” (ca. 1910/SW.III, 233). Here we move\nfrom meaning relationships to something like a productive relationship\nto which knowledge about the authors becomes relevant. But the first\nrecourse here is to consult more of the products of the author. How\ndoes a sentence fit into a paragraph, a chapter, a whole work, or a\ncorpus as a whole? Only if these contexts fail to resolve the problem\nmay we consider psychological claims about the author. The\nunderstanding of the individuality of an author should only bring in\npsychological factors as a last resort. Dilthey writes  \nwe understand individuals by means of their affinities, their\ncommonalities. This process presupposes the connection between the\nuniversally human and individuation. On the basis of what is\nuniversal, we can see individuation extended to the manifoldness of\nhuman existence. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 233) \nHowever, the highest form of understanding is not the reconstruction\nof the individuality of the author. It involves something that has\nbeen confused with reconstruction, but is distinct. What Dilthey\npoints to is a process of re-creation or re-experiencing, which he\ncontrasts with understanding as such:  \nUnderstanding as such is an operation running inverse to the course of\nproduction. But a fully sympathetic reliving requires that\nunderstanding go forward with the line of the events themselves. (ca.\n1910/SW.III, 235) \nRe-experiencing develops understanding by completing the hermeneutical\ncircle. If understanding goes “back” to the overall\ncontext, re-experiencing goes “forward” by following out\nthe parts that give focus to the whole. A re-experiencing is not an\nactual re-construction but produces a better understanding that\nrefines the original. This is made clear by the following example:\n \nA lyrical poem makes possible, through the sequence of its verses, the\nre-experiencing of a nexus of lived experience—not the real one\nthat stimulated the poet, but the one that, on its basis, the poet\nplaces in the mouth of an ideal person. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 235) \nWhereas the arts can expand the horizon of our lived experience by\nmeans of the ideal and imaginary means of fiction, history must do so\nby a process of structural articulation. The task of the human\nsciences is to analyze the productive nexus of history as it exhibits\nitself in stable formations or systematic structures. The productive\nnexus of history differs from the causal nexus of nature in producing\nvalues and arriving at purposes. \nEach such socio-cultural system can be regarded as being centered\nwithin itself on the basis of some function, whether it be economic,\nscientific, political, artistic or religious. The structures to be\nanalyzed here provide various cross-sections of what takes place in\nhistory. But there are also more composite and enduring\nsocio-historical contexts that we can delineate such as nation-states\nand historical periods. \nA nation-state is a composite institutional organization that contains\nand shapes many socio-cultural productive systems which then generate\ncertain commonalities. When socio-cultural systems transcending the\nscope of a nation come into contact with local productive systems,\nthey also begin to assume commonalities distinctive of that nation. In\nthe individual members of a nation-state these commonalities can\nproduce a sense of solidarity. But Dilthey also warns of excesses in\nthat regard when he notes that many Germans are “placing the\nhighest value ... not in the serene world-view of the Greeks, not in\nthe intellectually delimited consideration of purpose of the Romans,\nbut in the raw exertion of power without any limit”\n(1910/SW.III, 196). \nNation-states are regionally defined historical wholes, but we can\nalso delineate temporal composite wholes such as historical phases.\nWhat characterizes a generation according to Dilthey is the\ncrystallization of a movement sparked by the maturation of a certain\nage group. An epoch is more impersonal and large-scale. It marks a\npervasive “permeating tendency” (1910/SW.III, 198). Each\nepoch defines a life-horizon by which people orient their life.\n“Such a horizon places life, life-concerns, life-experience, and\nthought-formation in a certain proportion” (1910/SW.III, 198),\nwhich tends to restrain the way individuals can modify their outlooks.\nBut an epoch is only an overall tendency that encompasses opposing\nforces. In fact, a new epoch will often be sparked by the\ndissatisfactions produced by any force that becomes too dominant and\ncomplacent. \nThe structural analysis of history in terms of cultural systems and\nthe external organizations of society can be guided by the various\nhuman sciences. But a reflective mode of judgment is needed when\nhistorians try to make sense of the more composite structures of\nnation-states and epochs. History is both a judgmental art concerned\nwith meaning and a science concerned with objective truth. Only\nhistorical reflection can create the right balance that will transform\nthe conceptual cognition of the human sciences into adequate\nhistorical knowledge. \nThis shift to historical knowledge is the main theme of the notes (ca.\n1910) for a second volume of The Formation of the Historical World\nin the Human Sciences (1910) which were published posthumously in\n1927 as Drafts for a Critique of Historical Reason. Here\nDilthey analyzes the categories of life that are relevant to\nhistorical knowledge. He distinguishes between formal and real\ncategories. Formal categories stem from elementary logical operations\nthat are at work in all apprehension: they include the processes of\ncomparing, noting sameness, differentiating and relating. Although\nsuch elementary operations are prediscursive, they provide the basis\nfor discursive thought. The prediscursive noting of sameness prepares\nthe way for the unifying concepts of discursive thought and the\nprocess of relating provides the basis for synthetic procedures. These\nprediscursive and discursive modes of thought account for the formal\ncategories of unity, plurality, identity, difference, degree and\nrelation that are shared by the natural and human sciences. \nBut the real categories are not the same in the natural and human\nsciences. Whereas time is an ideal abstract form for the natural\nsciences, for the human sciences it has a qualitative content. It is\nexperienced as advancing into the future and “always contains\nthe memory of what has just been present” (ca. 1910/SW.III,\n216). The relation between the past and the present becomes the source\nfor the category of meaning which is Dilthey’s main historical\ncategory. The present never merely is in the sense of being\nobservable and it can be understood meaningfully only to the extent\nthat the past asserts its presence in it. When the present is\nlived, “the positive or negative value of the realities that\nfill it are experienced through feeling. And when we face the future,\nthe category of purpose arises through a projective attitude”\n(ca. 1910/SW.III, 222). Meaning, value, and purpose are the three\ncentral categories of the human sciences and each relates to time in\nits own way. What is valued by feeling focuses on the momentary\npresent, but for the will everything in the present tends to be\nsubordinated to some future purpose. Only the category of meaning can\nexpand the present into a presence that includes the past and\novercomes the mere juxtaposition or subordination of the various\naspects of life to each other. The understanding of meaning involves\nthe encompassing sense of reflective knowledge that attempts to relate\ncognition to evaluation and the setting of goals. \nDilthey’s distinction between the natural and human sciences is\nnot a metaphysical distinction. For that reason he does not create a\ndualism between nature as the domain of causality and history as the\ndomain of freedom. There are many determining forces at work in\nhistory because it cannot be divorced from natural conditions. But to\nunderstand how individuals participate in history we must replace the\npurely external relation of cause and effect with the integral\nrelation of “agency and suffering, of action and reaction”\n(ca. 1910/SW.III, 219). \nThe doing and undergoing that characterizes human involvement in\nhistory can be brought home most forcefully in autobiography.  \nHere a life-course stands as an external phenomenon from which\nunderstanding seeks to discover what produced it within a particular\nenvironment. The person who understands it is the same as the one who\ncreated it. This results in a special intimacy of understanding. (ca.\n1910/SW.III, 221)  \nAutobiography begins with what memory has selected as significant\nlife-moments, which reflection then gives a certain coherence. Thereby\nthe initial tasks of “explicating a historical nexus are already\nhalf solved by life itself” (ca. 1910/SW.III, 221). \nBut the fact that history derives a special intimacy through the\ncapacity for autobiography does not mean that we should be content to\nunderstand history through individuals alone. This also becomes\nevident in relation to Dilthey’s own work as a biographer of\nSchleiermacher. It became ever more clear to Dilthey that his\nbiography could not solve its task of understanding the life of\nSchleiermacher without considering the intellectual life of Berlin in\nwhich he participated. A biography is likely to bring more contextual\ndetermining factors into play than an autobiography, but the\nbiographer must remain open to the interplay of these influences and\nindividual initiative. Dilthey writes that an individual  \ndoes not face a limitless play of forces in the historical world: he\ndwells in the sphere of the state, religion, or science—in\nbrief, in a distinctive life-system or in a constellation of them. The\ninner structure of such a constellation draws the individual into it,\nshapes him, and determines the direction of his productivity.\nHistorical achievements stem from the possibilities inherent in the\ninner structure of a historical moment. (ca. 1910/SW.III,\n266–67)  \nIndividuals worthy of a biography are those who have seized those\nmomentary possibilities. \nWhen turning to the nexus of universal history, we move further beyond\nthe individual life-courses focused on by autobiography and biography.\nAlthough universal-historical understanding cannot ignore the results\nof autobiography and biography, it will focus more on the history of\nnations, cultural systems, and the external organizations of society.\n \nEach of these histories has its own center to which the processes are\nrelated and consequently the values, purposes, and significance that\nresult from this relationship. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 291) \nAnthropological reflection expects history to teach what life is and\nyet history is dependent on life as lived. There is a hermeneutical\ncircularity here that could be escaped “if unconditioned norms,\npurposes, or values [could] set the standard for contemplating an\napprehending history” (ca. 1910/SW.III, 281). Unlike his\nNeo-Kantian contemporaries such as Hermann Cohen and Heinrich Rickert,\nDilthey is not willing to accept unconditional values that transcend\nlife. The spiritual nexus of history “is that of life itself\ninsofar as life produces connectedness under the conditions of its\nnatural environment” (ca. 1910/SW.III, 280). Life is the\nultimate context behind which we cannot go. It is the horizon of\nproductivity which encompasses the organic and the mental, but cannot\nbe defined by either. Since “life is intimately related to\ntemporal fulfillment” (ca. 1910/SW.III, 249), historicity is\npart of its essence. Consequently, the objective validity that is to\nbe attached to any value cannot be separated from our temporal\nengagement with life. Values are not simply given or imposed from on\nhigh, but are produced as part of the human process of explicating the\nmeaning of history. In light of Dilthey’s skepticism about\ntranscendent unconditional values, it may seem surprising that he\npresented an ethical system that expects human beings to make\nunconditional commitments that are self-binding. \nIn 1890 Dilthey offered a lecture course at the University of Berlin\nthat was posthumously published with the title System of\nEthics (1890b). Here Dilthey sets himself the task of developing\na “psycho-ethical” approach that is rooted in\n“anthropological-historical analysis” (1890b/SW.VI,104).\nWhereas traditional psychology has analyzed feelings mainly as\nresponses to sense impressions that come from without, a\npsycho-ethical understanding of the feelings that can motivate us to\nact must be rooted in anthropological analysis of our inner drives,\ninstincts and desires. Instead of focusing on the intellectual\nprocesses whereby human beings adapt to their surroundings, Dilthey\nargues that most of our responses are basically emotive and\nvolitional. The feelings that measure the effect the world has on us\nare not just the subjective aspect of our representations of the\nworld. These feelings are rooted in certain drives among which a sense\nof group solidarity is central (1890b/SW.VI,104). \nThis solidarity encompasses a fellow-feeling\n(Mitgefühl)(1890b/SW.VI,104–05) that goes deeper\nthan the sympathy of the British moralists. Dilthey regards sympathy\nas a feeling “transferred from one living being to\nanother” (1890b/SW.VI,89). Sympathy, compassion, and pity are\nmodes of “suffering with” (Mitleid) that are\nderivative because they affect us from the outside. They involve an\nexternal “conjoint movement” (Mitbewegung) with\nothers (1890b/SW.VI,89). Dilthey considers these psychological forms\nof sympathy or empathy (Mitempfindung) to be superficial\ncompared to the more basic anthropological fellow-feeling of\nsolidarity that produces an “inner relationship”\n(1890b/SW.VI,104)– with others. \nThe extent to which we are motivated by a sense of solidarity is a\nfunction of the sphere of commonality of objective spirit that we grow\nup in. Our anthropological sense of solidarity and its fellow-feeling\nprovides a more positive incentive for sociability than Hume’s\nsympathy and Schopenhauer’s compassion. But even the fellowship\nof solidarity is a mere natural incentive which does not become\nethical until it is transformed into a more active or participatory\nincentive of benevolence (1890b/GS.X, 70). \nAs he develops his anthropologically based approach to ethics, Dilthey\nleads up to three main ethical incentives. One of them is the\nbenevolence (Wohlwollen) that we just related to human\nsolidarity. The other two incentives are to strive for what is right\n(Rechtschaffenheit) and to perfect oneself in a socially\nlegitimate manner (Vollkommenheit). These three ethical\nincentives had already been predelineated as moral principles in\nDilthey’s Habilitationsschrift of 1864 entitled\n“Versuch einer Analyse des moralischen Bewußtseins”\n(see 1864/GS.VI, 26–27). In fact, the concluding section THREE\n12 of the System of Ethics is taken almost exclusively from\nthis earlier work, where the ethical incentives were formulated as\nthree moral oughts. This raises the question how it is possible to\nmove from anthropologically derived ethical incentives that are a\nposteriori to ultimately arrive at moral oughts that are a\npriori. There is a crucial subsection THREE 9.3 that prepares us\nfor this transition. It is entitled “The Feeling of Duty and\nJustice, the Consciousness of the Commitment that Inheres in the Duty\nto Do What is Right or Just  .” Here Dilthey is quite\nexplicit that the commitment to do what is right demands a\nconsciousness that cannot be conceived as a mere instinctive inner\nbond with others rooted in our sense of solidarity. The commitment to\ndo what is right must now come from within on the basis of\n“respect for others as ends in themselves” (1890b/SW.VI,\n128). The mere life-value of group solidarity is elevated to the\nspiritual value of respect for all others as individual\nends-in-themselves. Having replaced Humean sympathy with benevolence,\nDilthey now engages Kantian duty as part of his analysis of moral\nself-reflection. But instead of appealing to respect for the law to\njustify doing what is right, Dilthey derives moral duty from a\ncommitment that is based on both a “fidelity to oneself and\nrespect for the self-worth of other persons” (1890b/SW.VI,128).\nThe sense of obligation (Verbindlichkeit) that comes with\nthis commitment (Bindung) involves a recognition of a\nreciprocal human connectedness rather than a one-sided dependence on a\nhigher law. \nFormally Dilthey moves even closer to Kant at the end of the lectures\nby acknowledging that ultimately we must make “moral\njudgments” that are “unconditional” and\n“synthetic a priori” (1890b/GS.X, 108). Although\nDilthey had rejected the possibility of synthetic a priori\ntheoretical judgments for outer experience, he is now willing to speak\nof synthetic a priori practical judgments for inner\nexperience. Had Dilthey published his 1890 lectures himself he would\nprobably have tempered the language that was imported from his early\nessay. But he clearly still thinks that morality requires judgmental\nassent to oughts that are unconditionally self-binding. \nThe normative implications of anthropological reflection about life\nand history also led Dilthey to address the value of worldviews. Just\nas the nature of universal history forces us to conceive of history as\nmore than a human science, so worldviews are more broadly based\nattempts at acquiring a unified perspective on life. The sciences are\nby their nature partial and cannot provide a comprehensive worldview.\nA worldview attempts to provide not only a cognitive picture of the\nworld, but also an estimation of what in life is valuable and worth\npreserving, and finally how we can strive to improve reality.\nWorldviews have been developed in literary, religious and\nphilosophical works. Philosophers have produced metaphysical\nformulations of worldviews that attempt to give them a universal\nconceptual determinacy. Dilthey analyzes three recurrent types of such\nmetaphysical formulations: naturalism, the idealism of freedom, and\nobjective idealism. The naturalism of Democritus, Hobbes and others\nderives everything from what can be cognized and is pluralistic in\nstructure; idealism of freedom as found in Plato, Kant, and others\ninsists on the sovereignty of the will and is dualistic; objective\nidealism as found in Heraclitus, Leibniz and Hegel affirms reality as\nthe embodiment of a harmonious set of values and can be considered\nmonistic. The three types of metaphysical worldviews are\nincommensurable in that each sets its priorities differently. Dilthey\nfinds naturalism too reductive; his ethical views incline him toward\nthe idealism of freedom; aesthetically he felt attracted towards\nobjective idealism. No metaphysical formulation can have more than\nrelative validity because it attempts to arrive at a totalization that\ntranscends experience. Literary and poetic expressions of worldviews\ntend to be more successful because they do not claim to be totalizing.\nAll that is humanly possible is to probe reality on the basis of\nlife-experience and to settle for more limited philosophical insights\ninformed by historical understanding. Ultimately, our reflective\nunderstanding of life and history must remain\ndeterminate-indeterminate. \nWe can see certain parallels with Dilthey’s attempt to replace\nmetaphysical systems with more informal life-based\n“meta-physical reflection” or worldviews in the young\nRudolf Carnap, who studied in Jena with Dilthey’s student Herman\nNohl before moving to Vienna. Carnap’s paper “The\nElimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language”\nrefers to Dilthey and his students as positive counterexamples to\nvarieties of meaningless metaphysical systems as found in Fichte,\nHegel and Heidegger. Another essay by Carnap entitled\n“Metaphysics as Expression of an Attitude to Life”\nacknowledges the importance of Dilthey’s notion of\n“Lebensgefuehl.” Carnap’s analogue for\nDilthey’s “Weltanschauung” is\n“Weltauffassung.” Carnap also incorporated a more\nor less Diltheyan conception of the human sciences in his Der\nlogische Aufbau der Welt of 1928. Carnap refers to\nDilthey’s Introduction to the Human Sciences, but\nreplaces its language of “facts of consciousness” with\nthat of “elementary experiences.” He does not refer to\nDilthey’s last main work Der Aufbau der geschichtlichen Welt\nin den Geisteswissenschaften, but he did read Hans Freyer’s\nTheorie des objektiven Geistes, a work heavily influenced by\nDilthey’s Aufbau and its reinterpretation of objective\nspirit as the medium of intersubjective communication. Carnap writes\nin his own Aufbau:  \nonly the more recent history of philosophy (since Dilthey) has called\nattention to the methodological and object-theoretical distinctness of\nthe domain of the human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften).\n(Carnap 1928: 23)  \nCarnap acknowledges the independent nature of spiritual\n(geistigen) or intersubjective objects such as political\nstates and social customs. They differ from psychical and physical\nobjects in that they can “survive” even as the original\nsubjects that generated them “perish and other subjects take\ntheir place” (Carnap 1928: 23). It is not clear why\nDilthey’s reflective analysis of the distinctive methods of the\nvarious sciences and his empirical approach to lived experience did\nnot earn him more serious consideration by the Vienna Circle as a\nwhole and other analytically oriented philosophers. But what is\nevident is that his theory of understanding (Verstehen) came\nto be widely misinterpreted as a kind of empathy. Although Dilthey had\nsharply differentiated between understanding as a judgmental process\nand empathy as a mere feeling, Carnap suggested that the understanding\nof others is an intuitive act that involves a measure of empathy, but\nwhich can be cognitively vetted in part through the analysis of\nobjective manifestations ranging from gestures, linguistic expressions\nto practical actions (Carnap 1928: 55, 143). This suggestion by Carnap\nmay have negatively influenced subsequent discussions of\nDilthey’s theory of Verstehen by analytic philosophers,\nleading Theodor Abel, Ernest Nagel, and Arthur Danto to go even\nfurther by reducing it to “empathic identification.” Later\nDanto recognized that this is not the case and acknowledged that\n“Verstehen is a very brilliant notion, utterly\nmisconceived heretofore by crass philosophical critics, myself\nincluded” (Danto 1970: 215). Verstehen is not some\nimmediate projection of ourselves into others, but stands for a\ndeliberate process that finds the proper context to relate others and\ntheir objectifications to what is already familiar to us. It is a\nreflective mode of inquiry that provides the framework for more\nspecific explanations, whether causal or rational.","contact.mail":"philrm@emory.edu","contact.domain":"emory.edu"}]
