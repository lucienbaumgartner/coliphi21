Aristotle says that without the\nprinciple of non-contradiction we could not know anything that we do\nknow. Presumably, we could not demarcate the subject matter of any of\nthe special sciences, for example, biology or mathematics, and we\nwould not be able to distinguish between what something is, for\nexample a human being or a rabbit, and what it is like, for example\npale or white. Aristotle’s own distinction between essence and\naccident would be impossible to draw, and the inability to draw\ndistinctions in general would make rational discussion\nimpossible. According to Aristotle, the principle of non-contradiction\nis a principle of scientific inquiry, reasoning and communication that\nwe cannot do without.\n\n\n\nAristotle’s main and most famous discussion of the principle of\nnon-contradiction occurs in Metaphysics IV (Gamma) 3–6,\nespecially 4. There are also snippets of discussion about the\nprinciple of non-contradiction early in the corpus, for example in\nDe Interpretatione, and there is the obscure chapter 11 of\nPosterior Analytics I, but none of these rival Aristotle’s\ntreatment of the principle of non-contradiction in\nMetaphysics IV. The discussion below mostly concerns the main\ninterpretative and philosophical issues that arise from reading\nMetaphysics IV 3–6.\n\n\n\nAristotle’s discussion of the principle of non-contradiction also\nraises thorny issues in many areas of modern philosophy, for example,\nquestions about what we are committed to by our beliefs, the\nrelationship between language, thought and the world, and the status\nof transcendental arguments. Arguments from conflicting appearances\nhave proved remarkably long-lived, and debates about skepticism,\nrealism and anti-realism continue to this day.  \n\n\n\nThere are arguably three versions of the principle of\nnon-contradiction to be found in Aristotle: an ontological, a doxastic\nand a semantic version. The first version concerns things that exist\nin the world, the second is about what we can believe, and the third\nrelates to assertion and truth. The first version (hereafter, simply\nPNC) is usually taken to be the main version of the principle and it\nruns as follows: “It is impossible for the same thing to belong\nand not to belong at the same time to the same thing and in the same\nrespect” (with the appropriate qualifications) (Metaph\nIV 3 1005b19–20). The following are some of those\nqualifications: The “same thing” that belongs must be one\nand the same thing and it must be the actual thing and not merely its\nlinguistic expression. For example, it is possible for someone to be a\npitcher and not a pitcher where “pitcher” in the first\ninstance refers to a baseball player and in the second to a jug that\ncan hold beer. Also, while it is possible for x to be\nactually F and potentially not F, it is impossible\nfor something to be actually F and actually not F.\nA table can be actually red and potentially not red, but not actually\nred and actually not red at the same time. \n\nThe second version is as follows: “It is impossible to hold\n(suppose) the same thing to be and not to be (Metaph IV 3\n1005b24 cf.1005b29–30).” Although this version is\nambiguous as it stands, it is best understood as the claim that it is\nimpossible to hold the same thing to be F and not to be\nF &c. \n\nAs a descriptive account of human psychology, this may seem\nimplausible. People surely have inconsistent beliefs; indeed, most of\nus have many inconsistent beliefs.  This is especially true if we take\ninto account the consequences of our beliefs. Must one, though,\nbelieve the consequences of one’s beliefs? These remain difficult\nissues in modern philosophy of language and epistemology.  Can one\nknowingly believe an outright contradiction? Heraclitus, for instance,\nseems to say contradictory things.\nHere, Aristotle might retort, and he does so retort with respect to\nHeraclitus, that people can utter such words, but cannot really\nbelieve what they are saying (Metaph IV 3\n1005b23–26). \n\nAn alternate way of understanding the second formulation is to treat\nit not as a descriptive claim about human psychology, but as a\nnormative claim, a claim about what it is rational to believe. On\nthis view, it is not that one cannot believe that x is\nF and not F &c, but that one cannot rationally\ndo so. \n\nIt is not completely clear how Aristotle understands the second\nformulation. At the end of Metaphysics IV 3, Aristotle gives\na bad argument that the doxastic version rests on the ontological\nversion, confusing belief that not p with not having the\nbelief that p. \n\nThere is a further problem with this second formulation. We need to\ndistinguish the possibility of believing that x is F\nand not F in a particular case from the possibility of\ndisbelieving the first version of PNC in its full generality. \n\nThe third version is that “opposite assertions cannot be true at\nthe same time” (Metaph IV 6 1011b13–20). As it\nstands, this version is neutral about the internal structure of the\nassertion, but Aristotle assumes that any assertion involves\npredicating one thing of another. As with the second formulation, one\nmight give a psychologistic interpretation, relating to what people\nactually do affirm and deny, but the idea that opposite assertions\ncannot be true at the same time suggests that this third version is better\ninterpreted as a variant of the first formulation. \n\nWhich version Aristotle intends to establish is a matter of\ncontroversy. He could be establishing the second version on the basis\nof the first, or the first version on the basis of the second, or just\nthe second version. \n\nAristotle says that PNC is one of the common axioms, axioms common to\nall the special sciences. It has no specific subject matter, but\napplies to everything that is. It is a first principle and also the\nfirmest principle of all. Like modus ponens, as Lewis Carroll\nmemorably showed, PNC does not function as a premise in any argument.\nUnlike modus ponens, PNC is not a rule of inference.\nAristotle says that it is a principle which “is necessary for\nanyone to have who knows any of the things that are”\n(Metaph IV 3 1005b15). It is no mere hypothesis. \n\nAristotle explains that, given its peculiar status as the firmest\nfirst principle, PNC is not susceptible to demonstration. A\ndemonstration is a deductive argument, the conclusion of which is\ndeduced from firmer, prior premises. It follows that if PNC could be\ndeduced from another premise, then that premise would have to be a\nfirmer and prior principle, with the result that PNC could not have\nbeen the firmest first principle.  Aristotle also says that if PNC\ncould be demonstrated, then everything would be subject to\ndemonstration, which would lead to an infinite regress. Therefore\ndemonstration is ruled out, and one must be wary of reconstructions of\nAristotle’s discussion in terms of ordinary deductive\narguments. Anyone asking for a deductive argument for PNC, as\nAristotle points out, is missing the point, or, rather, is asking for\nsomething that is impossible without using PNC. You cannot engage in\nargument unless you rely on PNC. Anyone who claims to reject PNC\n“for the sake of argument” is similarly misguided. \n\nGiven the impossibility of deducing PNC from anything else, one might\nexpect Aristotle to explain the peculiar status of PNC by comparing it\nwith other logical principles that might be rivals for the title of\nthe firmest first principle, for example his version of the law of\nexcluded middle—for any x and for any F, it is\nnecessary either to assert F of x or to deny\nF of x. Instead, Aristotle defies others to find a\nprior principle (Metaph IV 4 1006a10–11). For modern\nphilosophers, it is still an interesting question whether PNC is prior\nto other principles of logic, or, indeed, to the notions of truth,\nreference and identity. PNC assumes the notion of identity: It is\nimpossible for (one and) the same thing to belong and not to\nbelong to (one and) the same thing at (one and)\nthe same time &c. PNC is presupposed by Leibniz’s law,\nwhich states that if\nx and y are discernible (if one has a property that\nthe other lacks), then x is not identical with\ny. \n\nAlthough PNC is not subject to demonstration, it is subject to\n“elenctic refutation” according to Aristotle. The\n“elenchus” refers to the Socratic method of argument.\nWhen Socrates uses the elenchus, he gets his opponent to refute\nhimself out of his own mouth. The opponent makes a proposal that is\nshown to conflict with other claims to which he agrees. To be\nconsistent, the opponent must give up one of these claims, and he\nusually abandons the original proposal. This is the method of\nreductio ad absurdum familiar to ancient Greek geometers and\nmodern formal logicians and mathematicians. \n\nThe idea of using an elenchus is at first sight very puzzling. The\nperson claiming to reject PNC is not being consistent and apparently\ndoes not want to be. Aristotle is not trying to catch the opponent in\na formal contradiction. The opponent purportedly does not care about\nthat, and it would be begging the question. Instead, Aristotle’s trick\nis to draw the opponent into saying something, without making a\ncomplete statement, that shows that he does accept that x is\nF and is not at the same time not F, in spite of the\nwords he previously said. In other words, Aristotle needs to show that\nhis opponent is committed to at least one thing that is not\ncontradictory. The Socratic\nmethod is turned on its head. \n\nIt has long been noted that Aristotle is here assuming that his\nopponent takes the very strong position that for any x and\nfor any F, it is possible for F to belong and not to\nbelong to x at the same time in the same respect &c.\nLater he says that he is glad to have stamped out the view according\nto which we do not have anything definite in our thinking\n(Metaph IV 4 1009a3–5). \n\nAristotle’s “elenctic refutation” has been fruitfully\ncompared to a Kantian transcendental argument. Transcendental\narguments generally run as follows: If certain aspects of experience\nor thinking are possible, the world must be a certain way. Since\nthese aspects of experience or thinking do exist, the world\nis a certain way. These aspects of our experience or\nthinking presuppose that the world is a certain way. That the world\nis a certain way explains these aspects of our experience or\nthinking and not the other way round. On this interpretation,\nAristotle would be arguing that the world conforms to PNC, or that PNC\nis true, because it is presupposed by and explains the opponent’s\nability to say something significant. \n\nTranscendental arguments are controversial. One controversy surrounds\nthe precise content of their conclusions and what exactly is\npresupposed. Should one conclude that the world must be a certain way\nor merely that we have to think that it is a certain way, in order to\nhave the experience and thoughts at issue? The modern debate finds\nits counterpart in debate among scholars about what Aristotle is\naiming to do in his elenctic discussion. There are two main\npossibilities. Aristotle may be aiming to show that the ontological\nversion of the principle of non-contradiction is true, or he may be\naiming to show merely that it cannot be disbelieved. \n\nAristotle challenges the opponent to signify some one thing both to\nhimself and to another, for example, “human being”.\nAristotle explains that the word chosen by the opponent can have\nseveral meanings, provided one definition can be assigned to each and\neach definition is assigned a different word. Aristotle says that the\nword may not have infinitely many meanings. Perhaps this is because\notherwise the opponent can keep on saying that we have not yet reached\nthe meaning she has in mind, or perhaps Aristotle envisages infinitely\nbranching meanings, so that we will never arrive at anything\ndefinite. \n\nAristotle next draws a distinction between “signifying”\nand “signifying about”. The opponent needs to do both and\nnot merely signify about. One can signify about something by saying\n“pale (thing)”, but that does not tell you what you are\nsignifying, e.g., a human being. “Human being” both\nsignifies about and signifies a human being. If “human\nbeing” means something definite, for example, “two-footed\nanimal” (Aristotle’s dummy definition), then, Aristotle\nconcludes, it is impossible that the same thing be a human being and\nnot be a human being. (For a parallel discussion, see Posterior\nAnalytics I 22.) \n\nOn such an account, Aristotle is showing the opponent that if she\nwants to reject PNC she must pick out the same object and say that\ncontradictory predicates apply, but if she does not mean anything\ndefinite by “human being”, for example, then she will be\nunable to pick out a subject of predication, for example, a human\nbeing, and say that contradictory predicates apply. Saying that an\nindividual human being is a human being and not a human being, where\nthe first means “two-footed animal” and the latter means\nsomething different is not to reject PNC. That is why the opponent\nmust pick a particular word with a definite meaning. \n\nOn an alternative account, Aristotle is merely talking about kinds.\n“Pale (thing)” does not signify a kind, whereas\n“human being” does. Signifying one thing does not involve\nsignifying an individual who is a member of a kind, but simply one\nkind. \n\nThe details of the argument are controversial. Is it meant to be\ngeneralizable across the board so that it would work for things that\nare not substances, for example, qualities like redness? Aristotle\nelsewhere says that the sweet is necessarily so (Metaph IV 5\n1010b24–6). Must the opponent say something that names a natural\nkind? What if the opponent says “animal”, naming a genus\nrather than a species? What if the opponent says\n“goatstag”, something that does not exist? Does the\ndistinction between “signifying” and “signifying\nabout” necessarily lead to subjects that are individuals (for\nexample, individual human beings or horses) and their properties?\nHere, we run into the issue of Aristotelian essentialism. \n\nAristotelian essentialism is the view that there exist what modern\nphilosophers would treat as natural kinds, for example, human beings,\nhorses and acanthus plants. Individuals belonging to these kinds have\nessential natures that are definable. These individuals cannot\nsurvive a change in essence, but they can survive a change in their\naccidental properties. There is a difference between dying and dyeing\none’s hair. When a human being ceases to be a human being, she dies.\nBy contrast, when her hair is dyed a different color, she survives.\nIn an earlier work, Aristotle distinguishes essence, for example the\nnecessary property of being rational for a human being, from accident,\nfor example, being asleep, and from distinctive properties, those\nnecessary properties that are explained by rationality but are not\npart of the human essence, for example, the capacity to learn a\nlanguage (Topics I 5). It is a puzzling feature of the\nargument of Metaphysics IV 4 that distinctive properties are\nnot explicitly mentioned. \n\nAristotle says that those who refuse to take up the challenge to\nsignify one thing “do away with substance and essence. For they\nmust say that all attributes are accidents, and that there is no such\nthing as ‘being essentially a human being’ or ‘an\nanimal’” (Metaph IV 4 1007a20–23).\nAccording to Aristotle, then, those who claim to reject PNC are\nrejecting Aristotelian essentialism. Aristotle connects “merely\nsignifying about” with denoting an accident, and\n“signifying” with denoting the bearer of an accident, the\nbearer being a substance. If the opponent refuses to\n“signify”, she is left with accidents. \n\nNext, Aristotle tries to put Humpty Dumpty together again: Accidents\ncannot be predicated of accidents, but they must be predicated of\nsomething. For example, if there are accidents such as the musical or\nthe pale, these cannot be predicated of one another, so they need a\nsubject with an essential nature to be predicated of, for example,\nSocrates, a human being. While Socrates is pale and musical, the pale\nis not musical, nor the musical pale, unless all this means is that\nSocrates is pale and musical. Nor does a collection of\naccidents—the pale, the musical and so on—add up to one\nsubject like Socrates. Nor does it tell us what Socrates is, a human\nbeing. Accidents need subjects and subjects that are substances and\nhave an essential nature, and, if that is the case, essentialism is\nreinstated and PNC applies after all. \n\nAccording to Aristotle, if the opponent refuses to speak, he is no\nbetter off than a vegetable. While this may seem to be merely\nill-tempered abuse, it has a serious side. If the opponent rejects\nPNC and essentialism, then he cannot explain why he is not a\nvegetable. Aristotelian essentialism, if correct, applies to oneself\nas well as to other things in the world. At first sight, it is not\nclear why the PNC-opponent is left with a picture of anything. But\nperhaps that is Aristotle’s point. Aristotle gives the PNC-opponent a\nworld in which accidents can be linked up in any way he likes.\nAnything goes in such a world, or nothing goes, depending on his\ntaste. Alternatively, as Aristotle puts it, “all things will be\none” (Metaph IV 4 1007a19). \n\nAristotle is arguing that the rejection of PNC leads to the rejection\nof Aristotelian essentialism, and the acceptance of Aristotelian\nessentialism leads to the acceptance of PNC. A controversial question\nis whether Aristotle is also arguing that the acceptance of PNC\nnecessarily goes hand in hand with the acceptance of Aristotelian\nessentialism. If Aristotle is claiming that to signify something is\nto signify a bearer that has an essential nature, this would lead to\nthe acceptance of both PNC and some form of essentialism. The\nargument itself does not rule out Platonic forms as the bearers, or\nmomentary objects, or numbers. Nevertheless, the argument could be\nsupplemented by Aristotle’s arguments elsewhere against Platonic\nforms, and his distinctions between different types of change in the\nworld. \n\nAristotle notes that even if the opponent fails to speak, she must\nstill act, and if she acts in a certain way, that shows that she\nthinks that things in the world are one way rather than another, and\nthat some courses of action are better than others. That is why\npeople do not walk into wells or over precipices, and it shows that\npeople think it better not to walk into a well or over a precipice\nthan to do so. Their actions show that they have beliefs that conform\nto PNC. \n\nIn response to Aristotle, one might wonder whether it is possible to\nact merely as if one has certain beliefs, without having\nthem. In Hellenistic philosophy, the question arises whether the\nskeptic can live his skepticism, and in modern philosophy the parallel\nquestion arises whether moral anti-realists can act on their theory.\nIf the answer is yes, then all Aristotle will have shown is that we do\nact as if we are committed to PNC, an answer that falls short\nof Aristotle’s aim in Metaphysics IV 4, whether this is\ninterpreted as to show that PNC is true or to show that PNC is\nindubitable. \n\nOn this view, we are left with a skeptical Humean or pragmatic\naccount. Aristotle’s account would be parallel to Hume’s skeptical\nsolution to the problem of induction: We just do proceed as if\ninduction is correct, even though we lack any justification for so\ndoing. Or compare Wittgenstein: “..the end is not an unfounded\npresupposition—It is an unfounded way of acting.” (On\nCertainty, Section 110). \n\nIs such a view coherent? Here it is appropriate to ask the skeptic\nwhat kind of justification she is seeking. The question returns us to\nthe problem of PNC being a first principle for which there is no\nordinary proof. Is it possible to act as if one has certain\nbeliefs even though one does not? Here the skeptic owes the\nnon-skeptic some account of “as-if belief” that differs\nfrom actual belief. If this is to act following “how things\nappear to one”, Aristotle is justified in asking whether they\ncan even appear to be F and not F to the same human\nbeing at the same time. “As-if belief” may commit one to\nPNC just as much as actual belief does. \n\n Action is the place where our beliefs collide with the world. If the\nskeptic is skeptical about beliefs, it is not clear that she can\naccept that there are actions, as opposed to reflexes and\nother involuntary movements. Such a PNC-opponent would become a\nrobot, not just a vegetable. \n\nAt the end of chapter 4, Aristotle says that however much things\n“are so and not so”, there “is a more and a less in\nthe nature of things”, for someone who thinks that four things\nare five is less wrong than someone who thinks that they are a\nthousand, and so there must be some truth to which the more true is\nnearer. He adds that even if there is not some truth to which the\nmore true is nearer, “still there is already something firmer\nand liker the truth, and we shall have got rid of the unqualified\ndoctrine which would prevent us from having anything definite in our\nthought” (Metaph IV 4 1009a2–5). He first points\nout that we can make comparative judgments, even if we do not make\nabsolute judgments, and that comparative judgments presuppose some\nabsolute standard. But even if there is no absolute standard,\nsomething truth-like is presupposed and so we will not be prevented\nfrom having anything definite in our thought. \n\nOne might wonder how much of a concession these points are to\nAristotle’s opponent. A modern scientific realist would insist that\nour views merely approximate the truth. But would it be enough that\nthere be something “liker the truth”? It would be\ninteresting to work out the implications of these ideas for\nAristotle’s essentialism. Would Aristotle be sympathetic to\n“fuzzy essentialism” or “fuzzy realism”? How\nmuch vagueness can Aristotelian realism allow? These are issues about\nrealism that later Hellenistic philosophers and modern philosophers\nconsider in more detail. \n\nIn chapter 5, Aristotle distinguishes two types of opponent, those who\nclaim to reject PNC for the sake of argument, and those Pre-Socratics\nwho are genuinely perplexed. He now addresses the second type.\nAnaxagoras and Democritus are led to say that contradictions are true\nat the same time, because they are confused by change. They see\ncontraries coming into existence out of the same thing, and infer that\nthe same thing must have had contrary properties. Aristotle\nintroduces his distinction between the potential and the actual to\ndispel their confusion. An object can be potentially F and\npotentially not F, but it cannot be actually F and\nactually not F at the same time. \n\nOther philosophers are led by the argument from conflicting\nappearances to accept conclusions that violate PNC or lead to general\nscepticism. Aristotle presents the argument as follows: \n\nIn response to this argument, Aristotle concedes most of the first\npremise. He agrees that things do appear different to different\nmembers of different species, to different members of the same\nspecies, and even to the same individual, although he denies that the\nsame thing can appear differently to the same sense of the same\nindividual at the same time (Metaph IV 5 1010b18). \n\nUnlike modern philosophers, Aristotle does not attack the inference\nfrom premises 1 and 2 to the conclusions in 3. Instead, he attacks\npremise 2. If the attack is successful, he will have knocked down all\nthree conclusions at the same time. Aristotle’s attack on premise 2\ndoes not rest on accepting a majority verdict. Aristotle appears to\naccept his opponents’ argument that, in cases like 1a, where things\nappear different to different members of the same species, majority\ndecision is not an appropriate criterion for truth, because if the\nmajority were ill or mad, the minority would be thought to be in that\ncondition. He argues instead that people are not really confused as\nto whether magnitudes and colors are such as appear to those at a\ndistance or those nearby, or whether what appears to the weak or\nstrong is heavier or whether what appears to one asleep or awake is\ntrue. Once awake, a person in Libya is not confused about whether his\ndreams of Athens or his waking experiences are true; he does not start\nout for the odeon. Therefore, according to Aristotle, people do not\nreally find it unclear which appearances to take as true. \n\nAristotle extends his discussion to opinions, arguing that not all\nopinions are equally authoritative. Aristotle points out that when it\ncomes to questions about our future health, the opinion of the\nphysician is not on a par with a lay person. Nor are our senses\nequally authoritative on the same subject matter. Each sense is\nauthoritative about its own special objects. For example, sight, and\nnot taste, is the authority on color, but taste, and not sight, is the\nauthority on flavor (Metaph IV 5 1010b11–17).\nAccording to Aristotle, then, it is far from unclear which\nappearances, or whose opinions, are to be trusted in cases of\nconflict. Those who profess to deny this, show, by their own actions,\npresumably by trusting only their waking appearances when they are\nawake, and by consulting a physician when they are ill and so on, that\nthey believe quite the reverse. Therefore, according to Aristotle,\nthe second premise of the argument from conflicting appearances is\nfalse, and so the argument fails. \n\nAristotle has not had the last word. The skeptics of Hellenistic\ntimes made much of arguments from conflicting appearances, and modern\nphilosophers continue to discuss their efficacy, especially in the\nfield of ethics. \n\nAt the beginning of Metaphysics IV 5, Aristotle says that PNC\nstands and falls with the doctrine of Protagoras, that each individual\nhuman being is the measure of all things. In his Theaetetus\n151–183, Plato argues that Theaetetus, who holds that knowledge\nis nothing but perception, is committed to Protagoras’s view via an\nargument from conflicting appearances. If the wind appears cold to\nyou but hot to me and knowledge is nothing but perception, then we\nmust both be correct, as Protagoras says. \n\nPlato goes on to argue that Protagoras is committed to the view that\nnothing is anything in itself (otherwise one might be wrong about how\nit really is) and to a “secret” Heraclitean doctrine of\nflux. In order to accommodate more and more conflicting appearances,\nand to avoid violating PNC, more and more flux is needed, until we\nreach a radical version of Heraclitus’s doctrine according to which\neverything is “so and not so” (Tht 183), with\naccompanying difficulties for ordinary language. The extended\nargument also contains a mini-argument, a\n“self-refutation”, where Plato draws the\n“exquisite” conclusion that Protagoras refutes himself if\nhe agrees that other people disagree with his own view (Tht\n171A-D). If they are right, then he must be wrong! \n\nThe details of Plato’s argument, the fairness and the success of his\nstrategy against Theaetetus and Protagoras are matters of some\ncontroversy.  A recent point of contention is whether Plato’s\nProtagoras is committed to a view of “relative truth”\ninstead of flux, and how far Aristotle’s Protagoras is similar.  What\nis less controversial is that elements of Plato’s discussion\nre-surface in Aristotle’s Metaphysics IV.  Aristotle’s\nopponents are said to believe that knowledge is perception because\nthey think that what they perceive is all that exists, and they are\nalso said to be impressed by arguments from conflicting\nappearances. The thesis that knowledge is perception and an argument\nfrom conflicting appearances lead to Protagoras’s view in Plato’s\nTheaetetus. In Metaphysics IV 5, Aristotle agrees\nwith Plato that Protagoras’s view and the suggestion that everything\nis “so and not so” (an expression echoed by Aristotle\nearlier at Metaph IV 4 1006a30–31) go hand in hand.\nThe Protagoras of Plato’s Theaetetus and the PNC-opponent in\nMetaphysics IV 4 are said to be committed to the thesis that\nnothing is anything in itself, understood by Aristotle to mean that\neverything is accidental. \n\nWhile Aristotle does not saddle Heraclitus himself with the rejection\nof PNC, he notes that Heraclitus’s followers thought that there is so\nmuch change in the world that it is impossible to say anything true,\nand so Cratylus, one of their number, was reduced to wagging his\nfinger. Cratylus was mistaken, according to Aristotle, because there\nis no radical flux. When things change, something persists, and even\nif the quantity of a thing is not constant, we know each thing by what\nsort of thing it is. Presumably, even if its water is constantly\nflowing, we can still identify a river. Aristotle points out that if\nthere were radical flux, this would be tantamount to everything being\nat rest, so the idea of radical flux is contradictory. \n\nOne way to think of Aristotle’s strategy in Metaphysics\nIV is as the reverse of Plato’s. If the PNC-opponent says\nsomething significant, for example, the beginning of\nProtagoras’s doctrine of the measure, “human being”,\nthen she is committed to denying the thesis that nothing is anything\nin itself, and to accepting a non-Protagorean view. On this\ninterpretation of Aristotle’s strategy, at least two puzzling\nfeatures in Aristotle’s discussion are resolved, why he appears\nto be addressing someone who claims the contrary, and not the\ncontradictory of PNC, and how Aristotle can argue from the second\nversion of the principle of non-contradiction to the first. Since\nPlato’s Protagorean is forced to reject PNC across the board,\nAristotle’s Protagorean PNC-skeptic would be an opponent who\nclaims the contrary, not merely the contradictory, of PNC. In\naddition, a Protagorean PNC-skeptic, who accepts that “as things\nappear to one, so they are” would have to be impressed by an\nargument that shows that things cannot appear to him in a way that\nwould violate PNC. On his own view, showing that PNC is indubitable\nwould also show that it is true. \n\nAt this point, one might wonder if Protagoras can turn the tables on\nAristotle. Certainly, to a Protagorean, showing that PNC is\nindubitable would show that it is true, but it also assumes his own\nview, that how things appear is how they are! Does Aristotle or\nProtagoras win? The same can be asked of the “exquisite”\nargument of Plato’s Theaetetus. Is Protagoras’s\nview refuted or confirmed? The Stoic Chrysippus apparently wrote a\nwhole book, now lost, on such table-turning arguments. \n\nA further question surrounds the formulation of Protagoras’s own\nview.  In Metaphysics IV 6, Aristotle explains how a\nProtagorean PNC-skeptic ought to present his view so as to avoid\nviolating PNC: “those who seek to be compelled by argument, and\nat the same time demand to be called to account for their views, must\nguard themselves by saying that the truth is not that what appears\nexists, but that what appears exists for him to whom it appears, and\nwhen, and to the senses to which, and under the conditions under which\nit appears.” Otherwise, they will find themselves contradicting\nthemselves (Metaph IV 6 1011a20–25). However, Aristotle\nstill finds fault with this view because it makes everything relative\nto perception, including the perceiver. Not everything can be relative\nto perception, according to Aristotle. As he explains at the end of\nthe previous chapter, there is something beyond perception that causes\nthe perception and is prior. Aristotle uses his discussion of PNC and\nProtagoras to stake out a realist position. \n\nAt the end of chapter 6, Aristotle concludes, “Let this, then\nsuffice to show (1) that the firmest belief is that opposite\nassertions are not true at the same time, (2) what happens to those\nwho speak in this way and (3) why people do speak in this way”\n(Metaph IV 6 1011b13–15). \n\nOn the first point, as we saw, it is controversial whether\nAristotle’s conclusion that the firmest belief is a belief in\nPNC carries with it the presupposition that PNC is true, a\npresupposition that is needed for his own project of first\nphilosophy. On the third point, Aristotle discusses views about\nperception and change that lead people to say that they reject PNC. On\nthe second point, Aristotle shows that those who say that\nthey reject PNC do not really do so, or, if they do, they will be\ngiving up intelligible discourse and action, and—one might\nadd—they will be living in a world of mere sophistry and\npower. It is controversial how much of an essentialist or indeed\nrealist view one must accept if one accepts PNC, but it is clear that\nPNC is essential for the project of an Aristotelian science. Without\nit, Aristotle notes, beginners in philosophy who are interested in the\ntruth would be off on a wild goose chase (Metaph IV 5\n1009b36–8). Acceptance of PNC, then, may also have ethical and\npolitical implications. \n\nAristotle’s account of the PNC has been challenged anew by\nmodern-day dialetheists, who hold that there are some true\ncontradictions, and that Aristotle’s discussion fails to show\notherwise. One approach is to argue that some of Aristotle’s\ndiscussion of PNC begs the question in favor of PNC. (Of course,\nAristotle would agree that any argument in favor of PNC must beg the\nquestion.) Another approach is for dialetheists to refuse to let the\nAristotelian reformulate their supposed counterexamples to PNC by\nadding qualifications so that these supposed counterexamples do not\nviolate PNC after all. The Aristotelian can counter that without those\nqualifications the dialetheist has not said anything meaningful at\nall.  Finally, the dialetheist may ask how Aristotle would deal with\nthe liar’s paradoxical sentence “I am lying”. Why is\nthis not both true and false at the same time as the dialetheist\ncontends?  Besides dialetheists, some modern logicians, who need not be\ndialetheists, think that logic can be paraconsistent, i.e., that,\ncontrary to classical logic, one contradiction need not lead to an\nexplosion where anything goes.  While Aristotle is obviously not a\ndialetheist, it is not clear where he stands on the issue of\nparaconsistency in Metaph IV. Although Aristotle does claim\nthat if his opponent rejects PNC across the board, she is committed to\na world in which anything goes, he never argues that if (per\nimpossibile) his opponent is committed to one contradiction, she\nis committed to anything, and he even considers that the opponent’s\nview might apply to some statements but not to others (Metaph\nIV 4 1008a10–12). However one understands these passages, in\nthe Prior Analytics, Aristotle does commit himself to the\nview that syllogistic is paraconsistent (APr.  II 15\n64a15).  \nThis is an intriguing and relatively neglected text.  At first sight\nit looks as if Aristotle is presenting a valid argument that includes\ncontradictions as some of the premises, which would be surprising\ngiven his account of PNC in Metaphysics IV.  However, the\ntext is even more obscure than usual. \nThere are two basic interpretations.  According to one interpretation,\nAristotle does indeed include contradictions, but these are idle and\nplay no real logical role in the argument he presents.  According to\nthe other interpretation, following Aquinas’s commentary\n(lecture 20), Aristotle is not claiming that Callias both is and is\nnot Callias or that he is and is not a human being, for example, but\nthat the term “animal”covers Callias and those who are not\nCallias and not human beings, as Aristotle himself explains when he\nsays that the major term (“animal”) is more extensive than\nthe middle term (“human”).  (In the syllogism\nAll As are Bs; All Bs are Cs; therefore\nAll As are Cs, “A” is the major term and\n“B” is the middle term.) \nThere are difficulties with both interpretations.  Aristotle starts by\nsaying that no demonstration assumes PNC unless it concludes\nthat x is F and not not-F.  According to the\nfirst interpretation, Aristotle’s explanation about the major and\nmiddle term is unnecessary.  However, according to the second\ninterpretation, the relationship between Aristotle’s main point and\nhis comments about PNC is obscure.  The text invites further\nelucidation.","contact.mail":"plgottli@wisc.edu","contact.domain":"wisc.edu"}]
