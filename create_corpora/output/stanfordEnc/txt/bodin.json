There are two reasons why Bodin remains both\nfascinating and enigmatic: on the one hand, aspects of his life remain\nshrouded in legend; on the other, misunderstandings about his thought\nand political positions have engendered contradictions and\ndiscrepancies amongst historians which have been attributed mistakenly\nto Bodin himself. His most significant work, The Six Books of the\nCommonwealth (Les Six livres de la République,\n1576), represents the sum total of legal and political thought of the\nFrench Renaissance. His Method for the Easy Comprehension of\nHistory (Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem,\n1566) is at the pinnacle of early-modern, European humanism’s Ars\nhistorica. Finally, his work — if he was genuinely really\nthe author — Colloquium of the Seven about Secrets of the\nSublime (Colloquium Heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis\nabditis, 1683), which was published posthumously, provides clues\nabout his own religious views.  Bodin’s spiritual beliefs did not\ncoincide with any official religion of his day, but instead resembled\na form of natural religion.\n\n\n In this entry, we cite Bodin’s original works and their translations\nby using abbreviations.  These abbreviations are defined in the first\ntwo subsections of the Bibliography.  For example, Methodus\nwill refer to the original work in Latin (Methodus ad facilem\nhistoriarum cognitionem), while [Re] will refer to the\nB. Reynolds 1945 translation of Methodus into English and\n[Me] will refer to the P. Mesnard’s entire 1951 volume of French\ntranslations.\n\nJean Bodin was born near Angers between June 1529 and June 1530 to\nGuillaume Bodin, a wealthy “master tailor,” and Catherine\nDutertre. Bodin studied in his hometown and while still young, took\nthe habit of the Carmelites and lived in the monastery of\nNotre-Dames-des-Carmes. In 1545 he traveled to Paris with some of his\nreligious brothers to study philosophy under the tutelage of the\nCarmelite Guillaume Prévost. The two years Bodin spent in\ncapital city were rich in intellectual and spiritual\nexperiences. In 1550 he\nstudied at the respected law faculty of the University of Toulouse\nunder the direction of Arnaud du Ferrier.  At the end of his studies in Toulouse, Bodin became the scientific\neditor for the Latin translation (Oppiani De venatione, 1555)\nfrom the Greek of Oppian of Apamea’s third-century treatise on\nhunting.  In this work Bodin included a warm dedication to his\nprotector, Gabriel Bouvery, Bishop of Angers. In 1559, he published in Latin an\nAddress to the Senate and People of Toulouse on the Education of\nYouth in the Commonwealth (Oratio de instituenda in republica\njuventute ad senatum populumque Tolosatem, 1559).  Here Bodin\npraises humanism and calls for it to be taught in the public schools.\nAccording to Bodin, if humanism were included in the cultural\neducation the youth received, the political and religious harmony of\nthe State would be strengthened (Oratio 25): \n One education for all citizens and one religion for all the faithful\nwere Bodin’s conditions for civil agreement and cooperation within a\nState. Cultural and religious diversity were to be avoided. These\nideas remained important themes throughout his life. In 1560 Bodin returned to Paris where he was received by the\nParlement as “Counsel to the king.” In 1562 he signed the\noath of Catholicity that was required by the Chapter of Notre Dame of\nParis as of November 15, 1561. At the beginning of the civil wars,\nBodin wrote a letter to Jean Bautru of Matras, a counselor in the\nParlement of Paris who was also attracted to evangelical ideas. In the\nletter, Bodin believed that the “true faith” was the cause of the\ncivil conflict that afflicted France. Nevertheless he added that there\nwas no better proof of Christianity’s truth than that “human\nforces conspire against it. If religion can be considered as the\ngrounds and cause of wars, then those wars may be like a caring doctor\nwho cannot heal a deep-seated disease without causing great pain or\nprovoking much moaning from the patient.” Thus, Constantine\nstruggled against the tyrants for the “Christian\nreligion,” and before him Moses and Judas Macchabee fought\nagainst superstition (Lettre Bautru, [Ro] 79–80).  Bodin’s\nopinion on this subject is contained in a brief document in which he\nis less concerned to discuss the causes of the current war than he is\nto describe the distinguishing characteristics of his faith.  The\nsages of antiquity and the Christian era, he recalls, all\ndistinguished themselves through their high morals and piety. In 1566 Bodin published Method for the Easy Comprehension\nof History (Methodus).  In this work Bodin developed\nhis conception of universal, historical knowledge.  Not only did\nhistorical and juridical knowledge enable the proper management and\ngovernment of the State, but also rendered the State’s forms and\nchanges (conversiones) intelligible. Bodin continually surprises readers with the wide range of his\nknowledge. For example in his Response to the Paradoxes of\nMonsieur de Malestroit (Response, 1568), he explains\nhis views on economic and financial matters. His theses on free trade,\nthe benefits of exportation, and the error of establishing the value\nof money through royal decree regardless of the laws of the market,\nwere unexpected by his contemporaries. His reputation grew along with\nhis interest in public life and the problems of the realm. Also in\n1568, he attended the Estates of Narbonne, possibly as an envoy for\nthe central government. In 1570, he became the gruyer and\nprosecutor for the king in a commission for the forests of\nNormandy. During a debate on the ancient, royal right to collect\ntithes on the sale of forests, Bodin opposed the tithes and the\nsale. He considered both as forms of alienation; the king was only a\ncommon user of forests that actually belonged to the people. King\nCharles IX ignored Bodin’s objections and issued an edict in 1571\nalienating his rights. Regardless of this tension with the king, Bodin\nbecame the “master of petitions” and counselor to the\nking’s youngest brother, François-Hercule, who was then the\nDuke of Alençon. On August 8, 1573, Bodin was in Metz as a\nmember of the delegation that received the ambassadors of Poland, who\ncame to offer their country’s crown to the king’s brother Henry, Duke\nof Anjou. The Bishop and Duke of Langres, Charles des Cars, welcomed\nthe ambassadors in a speech delivered in Latin. Bodin immediately\ntranslated the speech into French (La Harangue, 1573). On\nthis occasion, Bodin contacted the negotiators who favored Henry’s\nelection to the Polish throne, including the Bishop of Valence, Jean\nde Monluc, and the State Counselor, Guy Du Faur de Pibrac.  Bodin had\nknown de Pibrac for many years, and Bodin later dedicated his\nCommonwealth to him. These contacts favored Bodin’s entry\ninto the court of Henry, King of Poland, who also became King of\nFrance in 1574. In the meantime, Bodin’s social situation improved\nthanks to his marriage to Françoise Trouilliart on February 25,\n1576. After the marriage, he succeeded his recently deceased\nbrother-in-law, Nicolas Trouilliart to the position of the king’s\nprosecutor at the présidial of Laon.  \n The year 1576 was central in Bodin’s life; in that year he published\nhis Six Books of the Commonwealth\n(République). In this monumental work Bodin tries to\nrestore the institutional bases of the French kingdom, which the\non-going war threatened to undermine on account of, among other\nthings, the Reformers’ doctrine concerning tyranny and tyrannicide.\nFor example, Bodin writes (République I, 8)\nabout certain authors of slander and treatises: \n  In describing these doctrines as “absurd and\nincompatible,” Bodin levels a harsh critique and lays the basis\nfor his response in his Six Books of the Commonwealth. Bodin\nsupported the right of resistance in general, but he opposed the right\n“to take up arms.” Armed resistance was a tactic that the\n“Huguenots” claimed as a right, especially after the\nravages of the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre. But 1576 was equally\nimportant in the history of France: after the king issued the Edict of\nBeaulieu (Paix de Monsieur) on May 6 and convened the Estates General\nin Blois, the wars of religion briefly subsided. In the royal edict,\nnext to the words “those followers of the so-called Reformed\nReligion,” a distinction is made between “United”\nCatholics or the “Union of Catholics,” and the\n“associated” Catholics. The associated Catholics comprised\nthe Duke of Montmorency and other supporters of\nFrançois-Hercule, the current Duke of Anjou and Alençon,\nas well as the Catholics who had signed the Act of\nAssociation in 1575 with a party of moderate\n Huguenots.[4] \n The United Catholics was an association of Catholic nobles that allied\nwith Duke Henry of Guise, advocated the reunification of the faith,\nand strove towards religious concord in\nFrance.[5] Leagues\nand associations formed on both sides of the religious and political\nspectrum until France became more and more divided. At the same time, Bodin’s authority as an expert in affairs of\nState was growing. By the end of November 1576, he was received at\ncourt and sometimes dined with the king in order to discuss the most\ncurrent events. Elected as the deputy of Vermandois, Bodin was sent\nofficially to the Estates General of Blois. He recorded the\nproceedings of the meeting in his journal (Recueil, 1577).\nAfter attaining the presidency of the deputies of the Third Estate,\nBodin revealed his unbending support for the interests of the\n“people.” Beginning with the meetings held in the middle\nof February 1577 in Blois, he refused to compromise with the clergy\nand nobility who desired to review the Cahiers des\nÉtats in order to render the Third Estate the\nminority. Bodin’s haughty remarks jeopardized his position in the eyes\nof the king. Moreover he was firmly opposed to two royal petitions for\nsubsidies as well as the perpetual alienation of crown territory,\nwhich he considered the “property of the people.” This\nresistance to royal power in matters of financial politics went hand\nin hand with his resistance in matters of religious politics. Bodin\nwanted to see an end to the religious wars. Totally convinced of the\nneed for religious concord in order to facilitate political\nunification, he was willing to accept temporary measures of toleration\nuntil religious reunification could be achieved through the meeting of\n“a national or general council to resolve matters of\nreligion” which was slated to be held “two years\nlater.” In opposition to propositions made by Versoris (Pierre\nLe Tourneur), a fierce member of the League who supported violent\nmeans, Bodin was in agreement with the majority of the Third Estate\nwhose deputies concluded that “the majority of voices will\nimplore the king by written request, to unite his subjects in a\nCatholic, apostolic, and Roman religion by all holy and legitimate\nmeans without war.” Here, in two lines, was the essence of\nBodin’s program of concord—not permanent religious\ntolerance. In the meantime, on January 6, 1577, Henry III had revoked\nthe recent Edict of Beaulieu, and declared that he would no longer\ntolerate the “so-called Reformed religion” in his realm.\nInstead he would allow only the Catholic religion in France. At the\nsame time, he took charge of the League or the Catholic Union. The tensions with the sovereign did not advance Bodin’s career. He\nhad to content himself for the time being as the royal prosecutor at\nthe présidial of Laon, where he planned to retire. His\nstudies and intellectual work increased and in 1578 he published\nExposition of Universal Law (Juris), a small\nmethodic textbook in which his theory of universal rights completes\nhis vision of universal history that he had developed earlier in the\nMethod. His work on judicial and historical research received\nnot only praise, but also criticism, often harsh, which malicious\nreaders heaped on him. For example, Michel of La Serre published a\nRemonstrance au Roi sur les pernicieux discours contenus au livre\nde la République de Bodin in 1579 that accused Bodin of\nattempting to diminish the sovereignty of the king and of defending,\nwithout being explicit, the Huguenots. This was exactly the opposite\nof what Bodin was trying to accomplish in his published works. On the\nother hand, the second accusation—the secretive membership in\nthe Reformed religion—has found favor today amongst some modern\nbiographers who attribute this membership to Bodin as a badge of\nhonor.  Bodin, knowing well that these two accusations were unfounded\ndid not deem it necessary to respond to his slanderer, le sieur de\nLa Serre, who in the meantime had been imprisoned on orders of\nthe king. But serious and reasoned opposition to Bodin’s work was also\nnot lacking. Professor Andreas Franckenberger did not accept the\narguments that Bodin leveled against the ideas of Sleidan and\nMelanchthon concerning the Old Testament book of \nDaniel.[6] \nThey had posited that\naccording to Daniel’s theory of the “four monarchies” the\nmonarchy following Holy Roman Empire was destined to rule the\nworld. Pierre de l’Hostal disputed Bodin’s effort to reduce, through\nmathematic formulae, the number of government \ntypes.[7] \nAs for Bodin’s friend,\nthe medical doctor Augier Ferrier of Toulouse, he also challenged the\nnumerology with which Bodin attempted to forecast governmental\nchange.[8] In\nresponse to Ferrier and other detractors, Bodin took up the pen not\nonly to defend himself but also to attack his critics in his work\nDefense of Jean Bodin by René Herpin\n(Apologie, 1581).\n Bodin’s critics became more serious and dangerous with regard to\nhis On the Demon-mania of Witches that was published in 1581\n(Démonomanie). In his letter of dedication (December\n20, 1579) to Christophle de Thou, the first president of the Parlement\nof Paris, Bodin explains why he write the work and the meaning of its\ntitle. First, he hoped to denounce the mania, the spiritual errors,\nand distraction, as well as the “fury” that sorcerers\npossess as they “chase after the devil.” He wrote this\ntreaty with two purposes in mind: on the one hand, “to use it as\na warning to all who will see him [the devil],” and on the other\nhand, “to alert readers that there is no crime that could be\nmore atrocious or deserve more serious punishment.” Bodin wished\nto speak out against those who “try by all means to rescue the\nsorcerers through printed books.” He reminded all that\n“Satan has men in his grasp who write, publish, and speak\nclaiming that nothing that is said about sorcerers is true.” It\nwas essential to provide the tools to magistrates and judges, who were\nconfronted by the accused sorcerers, in order to face this formidable\nproblem. The work was bold and perilous for its author. Many wondered\nif Bodin, so curious about this topic, such an expert, so convinced of\nthe devil’s existence, may not himself have been involved with\nwitchcraft. These suspicions alarmed the authorities, and on June 3,\n1587, the general prosecutor to the Parlement of Paris ordered the\ngeneral lieutenant of the baillage of Laon to proceed with a search of\nBodin’s home, on suspicion of witchcraft. This inspection brought no\nresults due to the intervention of eight prominent citizens and two\npriests who registered their support of Bodin. In the 1580s, Bodin’s diplomatic responsibilities were reduced at\nthe same time that the prestige of the Duke of Alençon and\nAnjou, whom Bodin had accompanied on a voyage to England and Flanders,\ndiminished. After the Duke’s unsuccessful attempt to seize Antwerp,\nBodin wrote to his brother-in-law, Nicolaus Trouilliart, on January\n22, 1583 and explained his useless efforts to dissuade the duke from\nsuch an undertaking. The death of Duke François-Hercule, the\nyoungest brother of the king, raised dynastic problems: the\npresumptive heir, Henry of Navarre, was the leader of the Huguenots,\nand he was related to Henri III to the 22nd degree. Facing\nthe eventuality of a “heretic” king, the League took the\nupper hand, and the Catholics strengthened their Holy Union. The\n“perpetual and irrevocable” Edict of Paris (called the\nPeace of Nemour) on July 7, 1585 prohibited the exercise of the\nreformed cult, and effectively revoked the Edict of Poitiers of the\nSeptember 17, 1577 (also “perpetual and irrevocable”),\nwhich had conceded a slight, provisory measure of tolerance. The edict\nof 1585 was confirmed by the Edict of Rouen of July 1588 and was\nmoreover defined as the “inviolable and fundamental law.”\nIn other words, religious concord, in this case “forced”\nconcord, represented the highest priority for the lawmakers. There are\ntwo sorts of religious edicts that alternate during the wars: edicts\nof pacification and provisional tolerance, and edicts of concord and\nunion.  In the “edicts of pacification,” which Bodin\nbelieved were the best means to avoid war, temporary tolerance takes\nprecedence while final peace is delayed until a time when “God\nwill grant us the grace to unite the nation in the same fold.”\n“Edicts of Union” or “Uniformity” (this was\nthe word preferred by the Kings of England in their Acts of\nUniformity) imposed peace through force and thereby implied that\nwar could begin again. The Estates General of Blois sanctioned, on\nOctober 18, 1588, The Edict of Rouen as “the fundamental and\nirrevocable law of this kingdom.” The crisis reached its peak\nduring a quick succession of events that shook the kingdom.  First, on\nDecember 23 and 24, 1588, the leader of the Catholics, Henry of\nLorraine [third Duke of Guise], and his younger brother, Louis de\nLorraine, Cardinal of Guise and Archbishop of Reims, were assassinated\non the orders Henry III. Second, in January 1589, the Parlement of\nParis denounced this “massacre,” and the theology faculty\nof the Sorbonne freed subjects from their oath of faithfulness and\nobedience to the king.  Finally on August 1, 1589, Jacques\nClément, believing that he was killing a tyrant, assassinated\nthe king. On August 4, 1589, Henry of Navarre claimed that he was\nwilling to “be instructed” in order to return to the\nCatholic faith. The reality was such that, while the parties fought to\nclaim the throne, the kingdom was without a king and the royalist\nparty, which included Bodin, without a leader. During this period,\nBodin, as a public figure, as the man responsible for the city of\nLaon, as a well-known authority on constitutional rights, and as a\nprivate citizen, was obligated to define publicly his political\npositions. The Letter by Jean Bodin in which he discuss the reasons why he\nbecame a member of the League (Lettre Bodin), of January\n20, 1590, published in Paris, Lyons, Toulouse, and Brussels, is\nclearly a masterpiece of political analysis once it is properly framed\nwithin its historical context. The work continues to be discussed and\ndisparaged by historians and biographers of Bodin. Bodin explains why\n“the inhabitants or most of them” of Laon, including\nhimself, became members of the “League.” Three factors\nplayed a role: first, article 9 of the 1588 Edict of the Union order\nall subjects to “join the current union” under the threat\nof being judged guilty of\nlèse majesté; second was the fear that\n“a regiment of Captain Bourg” would loot the town; third,\nassassination attempts had been launched against him [Bodin], from\nwhich he had barely escaped.  Some would say that Bodin was forced to\nchange his political position, but this is not the case; rather, great\nchanges had occurred in the historical reality.  Many, but not\nall, of the royalists (“regalists”) found themselves\nwithout a king or a party, turned toward the League as the group with\nthe most similar agenda—the program of concord. In effect, the\nroyalists and the League had had similar views regarding concord, the\nsurvival of political institutions, and the Gallic State. They\ndisagreed however about the means to achieve their objectives, most\nnotably how quickly to go to war against the Huguenots, the excessive\npower of the Duke de Guise (which diminished the authority of the\nking) and the interference of the pope and Spain. On these points\nBodin, as a loyal officer of the king, kept his distance from the\nLeague. At that time the changes were so distressing that Bodin\nbelieved it was necessary to explain publicly the new circumstances in\nwhich France and the French found themselves. Only with these new\ncircumstances in mind should Bodin’s response be evaluated. He himself\ndid not question the changes because all that mattered for him was\nthat he continued to serve the people whose well-being was “the\nsupreme law.” Bodin’s continuing loyal service reveals his\nposition. He had considered all of the matters carefully because he\nbelieved he would face “the judgment of God,” concerning\nhis own actions as well as those of France. If the town should fall\n“into the hands of enemy [clearly the Huguenots],” Bodin\nwrote that he would worry neither for his life nor his goods,\n“as long as I [he] could serve the public.”  Examining the general situation of the warring factions, Bodin\nexpresses himself frankly.  He knew how to judge one of the most\ncomplex moments in French history clearly and without partisanship. By\nanalyzing how he reaches his opinions, we can better understand his\nideas. The prospects for a peace agreement were small because\n“the leaders and the partisans were, whether in the State or the\nChurch, at odds in their morals, behavior, and inclinations. They\nabsolutely cannot agree by speaking together.” Besides, the two\nparties were powerful internally and externally.  The Maréchaux\nof France, the main officers of the crown, the second estate of the\nnobility all of the Huguenots, “politiques” and atheists\nand nearly all of the princes of the blood belonged to the party of\nthe King of Navarre. Thus, in Bodin’s view, the “politiques and\natheists” were linked to the reformed, which he considered the\nenemy. Outside of the kingdom, they were even more powerful and\ncounted in their alliance: England, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, the\nfour Swiss cantons, and the Protestant princes of Germany. Addressing\nthe party of the Holy Union, Bodin eulogized its leader, the Duke of\nMayenne [Charles of Lorraine, the third son of Duke François de\nGuise and brother of the deceased Duke Henry], “whom it seems\nthat God has appointed to be the Protector of Religion and the\nState.” In this circumstance, “this good leader, in\naddition to the public interest, can rightly pursue vengeance for his\ntwo brothers.  Unfortunately he received bad advice from those who\ntoday carry arms and who belong to the opposing party.” This\nclause reveals much about Bodin’s opinion regarding the assassination\nof the Guises by Henry III, whom, Bodin believed, had been ill advised\nby the Huguenots. The Catholic party was strong in France, having on\nits side all of the clergy, all of the capital cities (except for\nBordeaux), nearly all of the provinces, and 150 “good\ntowns.” Abroad, the Catholics could call on the assistance of\nthe “Pope and the Holy See, Chief of the Union,” the\nemperor and Catholic King “whom we can call, without flattery,\nthe greatest prince carrying the title of king in Christendom over the\npast 150 years.” This list does not count other Catholic powers\nincluding the Dukes of Savoy, Florence, Ferrara, and Mantua, the\nCatholic Princes of Germany, and the three Elector Archbishops. As far\nas the right of succession, according to his calculations, forecasts,\nthe study of numbers, and degrees of relationship (to the thirteenth\ndegree for the Cardinal of Bourbon, Charles, brother of Antoine of\nBourbon—King of Navarre, father of Henry—and to the\nfourteenth degree for the present King of Navarre, Henry) Bodin had no\ndoubt that the Cardinal of Bourbon had a better claim than the King of\nNavarre.  “Therefore, the King of Navarre, however good and\nclever the advice he may have, is, in my judgment, ill-advised when he\ndoes not recognize Monseigneur the Cardinal of Bourbon as king.”\nHad he been better advised, Henry should have freed his uncle, whom he\nwas keeping in captivity, and allowed him to govern until succeeding\nhim.  Therefore, “he should stop this belligerence and contract\nan alliance with the House of Lorraine, by freeing the innocent Duke\nof Guise, [Charles of Lorraine, fourth Duke of Guise and eldest son of\nthe deceased] and the Duke of Elbeuf, [Charles of Lorraine, count of\nHarcourt] who is being punished unjustly.” Bodin demonstrates\nhis political acumen here not so much concerning the forecasts he\nmakes based on numerology ( he repeats “I foresee,” three\nor four times) but for the recommendations he makes to the King of\nNavarre before ascending the throne. First he writes that the King of\nNavarre should be reconciled with the Catholic Church, which Navarre\nhad already announced. Second, he should give the throne to his uncle,\nCharles de Bourbon, which given that Charles was sixty-seven at the\ntime and died in May 1590, would have been a temporary arrangement.\nHenry did not do this.  Third, he should have sought an agreement\nbetween the Lorraines or the Guises and the other Catholic princes.\nNavarre does this before and after he is crowned Henry IV. These\nrecommendations prove Bodin’s clear political judgment.  Here we see a relatively little-known side to Bodin which\nnevertheless is consistent with the principles he had outlined in his\nSix Books of the Commonwealth. His advice is perceptive and\nobjective; however, historians have glossed over this fact in order to\ndepict Bodin as a man who should have been ashamed of joining the Holy\nUnion. Yet Bodin was secure in his judgment, when he wrote \n(Lettre Bodin):\n  The victory of the Union would assure religious concord and the\nre-establishment of the institutions of the kingdom. This was Bodin’s\nwish and this is precisely what the Catholic and “very Christian\nKing,” Henry IV, later brought to fruition through the Edict of\nNantes of 1598. Nowadays, the generally accepted opinion that regards\nthe Edict of Nantes as a “perpetual and irrevocable” law\nof permanent tolerance (or coexistence of two religions) is erroneous.\nThis judicial measure was intended to restore the social and political\ncohesion of the realm in the short term.  In the long term it was\naimed at religious reunification in the one sole faith—that of\nthe king.  That is why the Edict was defined as a “law of\nconcord,” through temporary tolerance. This was the\nauthoritative judgment of Pierre de Beloy, the sole contemporary\njurist and commentator of the\n Edict.[9]\n Bodin did not live to see it. He died of the plague between June and\nSeptember 1596, after having declared in his testament that he wished\nto be buried in the church of the Franciscans of Laon. In his last years, Bodin occupied himself with two projects. The\nfirst, Colloquium of the Seven about Secrets of the Sublime,\nconcerned the essence of religion.  If indeed it was from Bodin’s hand\n(and its attribution to him has as many partisans as it has its\ncritics, as we shall see), it would have been written in these final\nyears of his life. The work would be published long after his death\n(Heptaplomeres, 1683). The other, Theater of Universal\nNature (Theatrum, 1596), dealt with natural philosophy.\nHe had just enough time to add a dedicatory letter to Jacques Mitte,\nCount of Miolins on March 1, 1596.  When he began his research, Bodin was drawn to analysis and\nsystematics as methods for organizing knowledge. In titling his work\n“Method”, he gave a new and definitive meaning to a word\nwhich previous authors had used to signify both “division”\nand “ratio” or “the procedure” for\nlearning a\n discipline.[10] \n In Method, Bodin encourages his readers to use analysis,\nwhich he calls “that pre-eminent guide to the teaching of the\narts […] in order that understanding of history\n(historiarum scientia) shall be complete and facile”\n(Methodus, [Re] 20; Latin [Me] 116).  According to Bodin, it\nis through analysis that one is able to divide universals into parts,\nand to divide each part into subsections without losing the coherence\nof the whole. Therefore synthesis, he states, is no longer necessary\nbecause the individual episodes of nearly all historical accounts are\nalready well adapted to each other, and the best historians\nhave carefully reconstructed these partial and regional accounts into\nthe tableau of universal history. Bodin writes (Methodus [Me]\n116): \n Bodin ascribes a unique role to political\nknowledge, thereby distinguishing his writings from many similar\ntreatments of the ars historica which were published at the\nend of the fifteenth\n century.[11] \n The masterpieces of this genre were produced in Italy such as\nFrancesco Patrizi, Della historia dialoghi dece, 1560; and in\nFrance by François Bauduin, De institutione historiae\nuniversae et ejus cum jurisprudentia conjunctione, Paris\n1561. Although he does not cite Bauduin, Bodin was indebted to this\nFrench author who was the first to describe in a scientific manner the\nmultiple connections between law and universal history. The chapter\nheadings include:  For Bodin, methodologies were visual representations of systems of\nknowledge.  He makes this point in his work Exposition, where\nhe states that the concept of “division,” which Plato had\ncalled divine, is the “universal rule of the sciences” (See also\nJuris, 1578).  If history is divided into divine history,\nnatural history, and human history, then law can be divided into\nnatural law, human law, the laws of nations, public law, and civil\nlaw. From there, Bodin briefly describes and defines legal matters\nincluding: contracts, crimes, property, obligation, authority,\njurisdiction, etc. Here more than in the Method, the reader\nsees Bodin’s pedagogical preoccupation with brevity and\nconciseness. The work is also illustrated with a number of schematic\ntables. In the private sphere, Bodin demonstrated his talent for\nteaching in A Letter to his Nephew\n(Épître, 1585), and in the short Advice on\nthe Education of a Prince (Conseil, 1574–1586),\nwhich had limited circulation. During his youth, Bodin received a Catholic education and he\nremained loyal to the Church until his death. Demonstrating his\nreligious convictions, in a testament from June 7, 1596, he requested\nto be buried in a Catholic Church. Nevertheless, during his middle\nyears, he was critical of the church hierarchy and occasionally\nexpressed antipapal sentiments. On the basis of this evidence, his\nbiographers have quickly labeled him a Protestant. Yet in his\nLettre à Jean Bautru des Matras, a text based on his\nyouthful religious ideas, it is clear that Bodin was not a pure\nProtestant, but rather a critic of the Roman Catholic clergy, its\nhierarchy, and some of its doubtful religious practices.  Bodin was a\nfervent believer in the “true religion” which he\nconsidered “nothing other than looking to God with a purified\n spirit.”[13] \n These words reveal less a reformed Calvinist than an adherent of a\nbelief system, whose orthodoxy was unclear, but which could be\ndescribed as natural religion. Bodin possessed an expansive view of\nreligion and a sincere belief in an all-powerful God. If he did agree\nwith some Protestants who criticized the traditional Catholic\nteachings on such matters as the “veneration of images of the\nsaints, the adoration of the Eucharist, and the belief in the fires of\npurgatory,” Bodin did not hold God responsible for these errors\nas certain sects did (e.g., the Epicureans, although the allusion is\nnot clear). \n In this letter Bodin refrained from all commentary on the doctrine of\nthe sacraments and dogma. Instead he considered the religion of\nChrist, to which he himself belonged (mea vel potius Christi\nreligio), as accessible to all men of good will. This included\nthe luminaries of the ancient world, most notably the Platonists, whom\nBodin considered “close to being Christians.” His words,\nalthough far from being those of an adherent of the Reformation, are\nno less those of a critic of the papal curia an advocate of reform\nwithin the Catholic Church who was calling for a return to the\nessential, pure message of the Gospels. On the other hand, amongst\nfervent Catholics, Bodin’s views on the freedom of\n conscience[14] \n caused him to be suspect, even though his opinions on the freedom of\nthe conscience was distinct from his theory of religious tolerance\n(the first was a matter for the private individual, the second for\ncivil and public life).  According to one contemporary in Bodin’s city\nof Laon, Antoine Richart, Bodin was “a politique and a dangerous\nCatholic” (Richart 1869, 68; cited in Chauviré 1914, 80).  A\nlater writer, Traiano Boccalini, labeled Bodin a “notorious\natheist” because he had recommended the “the freedom of\nconscience” (Boccalini 1618, I, 64, p. 195).\n The Heptaplomeres, written around 1593, appeared\nposthumously (Kiel, 1683). Here the author gives us evidence of his\nreligious beliefs (presuming, for the moment, that Bodin was, in fact,\nthe author). The seven speakers in the work represent as many\ndifferent religions, confessions, and philosophical schools of\nthought: Coroni, Catholicism; Salomon, Judaism; Senamy, Skepticism;\nOctavus, a renegade turned Muslim; Friedrich, Lutheranism; Curtius,\nCalvinism; and Toralbe, natural religion. Toralbe often, but not\nalways, seems to represent the author’s personal beliefs. Despite\ntheir diversity, the seven agree with the prohibition against publicly\ndisputing the fundamentals of religion since “all matters that\nare disputed are immediately called into doubt.” They also agree\nthat the freedom of conscience should be respected, because “one\nshould not be constrained in matters of religion, and beliefs should\nbe voluntarily embraced, not imposed” as Tertullian stated.  On\nthe other hand, the speakers differ on the freedom of worship. Even\nCurtius, the Calvinist, admits that “the desire to allow several\nreligions to practice openly in the same city seems to me to be one of\nthe most problematic issues in the world.” Although the author\ndeliberately leaves this discussion open and without a definite\nconclusion, the dialogue hinges on the thoughts of Toralbe who states\nthat “the laws of Nature and natural religion, which nature\ninspires in the heart, are sufficient for salvation.” The\ntheologian Johann Diecmann refuted Bodin’s Heptaplomeres in\nhis thesis, De naturalismo tum aliorum, tum maxime\nJ. Bodini (Diecmann 1683). But beginning with Leibniz, the\nHeptaplomeres has not ceased to attract the attention of\nscholars on account of its outstanding erudition and the depth of the\nquestions it addresses. His antipapal sentiments, interspersed throughout his writings,\nhave provided historians with evidence to label Bodin a\nProtestant. Nevertheless, his criticisms of the Catholic Church should\nnot be taken as signs of Bodin’s adherence to the Reformed creed since\nthe same views were expressed by a number of important jurists,\ntheologians, and writers of the period; many of whom held an active\ninterest in the new evangelical ideas. Some would later return to\ntraditional Christianity. Their Catholicism may not have conformed to\nthe orthodoxy of Rome, but it was similar to the reformist program of\nthe Erasmian School (see, for example, the cases of Charles Du Moulin,\nFrançois Bauduin, Claude d’Espence, George Cassander, Jean de\nMonluc, and others). Moreover, Bodin’s attacks on the papal curia did\nnot escape the scrutiny of the ecclesiastical authorities. The\nofficial censure of the Church placed the Methodus (1583,\n1591), République (1591), Démonomanie\n(1594), and the Theatrum (1628), on the Index of prohibited\nbooks. Bodin’s major work, the Six Books of the Commonwealth, is\na treatment of “political science,” a term which Bodin\njustly claimed he has coined.  The books are titled: \n  Bodin’s primary contribution to political science of his day is his\ndefinition of sovereignty.  Sovereignty, he contends, has an impact\nupon both the internal affairs of the State (such as in its exercise\nof full political power) as well as its external affairs (such as in\nits conduct of war and international relations). “Majesty or\nsovereignty is the most high, absolute, and perpetual power over the\ncitizens and subjects in a Commonwealth, which the Latins call\nMajestas” (République, I, 8 [Mc] 84). Bodin’s\ndiscussion of tyrannicide is consistent with his political theory. For\ninstance, while he states that there are instances when tyrannicide is\njustified (for example against tyrannical usurpers), killing a prince\npresumed to be a tyrant is forbidden if “the prince is an\nabsolute sovereign.” Bodin explains (République\nII, 5):  \n\nBodin paid particular attention to differentiating between the forms\nof State and the forms of government.  For instance he defined a\nmonarchy as the rule of one; aristocracy as the rule of a few; and\ndemocracy as the rule by all people. Yet monarchies might still be\ndemocracies according to Bodin, if the prince allows all of the people\nto have access to magistracies and State offices without regard for\nnobility, wealth, or virtue. Otherwise, a monarchy can be a form of\naristocracy if the prince bestows State responsibilities only to the\nmost noble, the richest, or the most virtuous. The same observations\nhold true for aristocratic and popular regimes.  \n\nThe distinctions between the forms of State and the forms of\ngovernment are essential for understanding the differences between\nroyal monarchies, despotic monarchies, and tyrannical monarchies. The\nlast two are easily confused.  Bodin writes\n(République II, 2):  \n\nThe difference between despotism and tyranny is crucial.  Despotism\nis legitimate and sometimes legal.  Tyranny, on the other hand, is\nalways illegitimate, illegal, and contrary to natural and divine laws.\nTherefore Bodin demonstrates that he is in process of constructing his\ntheory of sovereignty not that of despotism. The same can be observed\nconcerning absolute monarchies. When Bodin used the adjective\n“absolute” to define a sovereign, he did so as a Romanist,\nand as an historian of Roman law for whom the word absolutus\nwas linked to legibus solutus—the prerogative of the\none who is sovereign. One must pay close attention to Bodin’s writing\nto understand his concept of “absolute.” For Bodin a\nsovereign is “not bound” (absolutus) by the civil\nor positive laws which he or his predecessors had\npromulgated. Nevertheless a sovereign is always bound to natural and\ndivine law.  Sovereignty, according to Bodin, is as supreme as one\nwishes, but is also limited by natural and divine law.  The Kings of\nFrance were glorious because their sovereignty was limited by divine\nand natural law (cf. Methodus, [Me] 208–209).  Unfortunately,\nwith the introduction of the word “absolutism” in the\nnineteenth century, historians of political philosophy began to\nconsider Bodin as a theoretician of absolutism. This is a tendency\nthat continues even today.  In so doing, some historians have ascribed\na doctrine to Bodin that was foreign to him. Instead Bodin\nsystematized and defined a theory of sovereignty. But this problem\nof historical interpretation depends on the methodology and on the\nsynchronic and diachronic perspective: when historians do not compare\nBodin to Machiavelli, they study often Bodin in comparison to those\nwho came after him: Grotius, Althusius, Locke, and particularly\nHobbes, Montesquieu and Rousseau. Nothing should stop the historian\nfrom making such comparisons as long as it is not his or her sole\nmethod of analysis. As all historians understand, in order to fully\nand accurately understand an author, it is necessary to place his work\nsquarely within the context and debates of his historical\nperiod. Therefore one should judge and interpret Bodin based on the\nworks, sources, and documents current in his century rather than on\nthose that would appear in the future. In 1566, M. de Malestroict, master of accounts on the making of\nmoney, published his work, Paradoxes, to demonstrate that\ncontrary to popular opinion in France, real prices had not risen over\nthe past three centuries.  In other words, the value of money had\nremained proportional to the amount of gold and silver it\ncontained. For example, concerning inflation, Malestroict posited that\nalthough the price of land and property may have increased since the\nreign of St. Louis IX, inflation was not the culprit.  Instead he\nbelieved that it was the decreasing amount of gold and silver which\nthe money contained that caused prices to rise. Malestroict was\nconvinced, following the opinions of the time, that gold and silver\nwere representative values that were not influenced by the\nfluctuations of world markets.  Also, while the price of various items\nmight increase, the items were worth a constant amount of gold or\nsilver which did not fluctuate. Because wealth is judged by the\nquantity of money, “the metals are the true and fair judges of\nmarket value or the price of items.” Bodin refuted this argument and concentrated on the question of the\nabundance of gold and silver which he considered the principal and\nsingular cause for the high prices of his era. “Previously no\none had offered such an argument,” he says. In this matter he\nadded two other secondary causes for high prices: the monopolies of\nmerchants and craftsmen, who gathered in guilds and confraternities to\nestablish the price of goods according to their own whims, as well as\nthe scarcity of luxury goods. According to Bodin, war was another\ncause of rising prices: it creates shortages and therefore causes\ngoods to become more expensive.  Bodin posited that the solution to\nthis lay in ending conflicts, since then the parties could occupy\nthemselves with trade amongst themselves rather than waging war. In\nhis opinion on the relationship between money and the price of goods,\nBodin advocated an exchange, “which must be honest and free for\nthe wealth and the grandeur of the realm.” He was opposed to the\ndominant opinion of his day, which was that of Malestroict, and which\nheld that the solution to inflation was to attribute legal values to\nmoney by royal edict. For Bodin, the price of gold and silver should\nbe set by the laws of the market, in other words by supply and\ndemand. Hoping to advance these new ideas, Bodin was worried for\npeople overwhelmed by inflation.  According to Bodin a ruler\n“who changes the price of gold and silver ruins his people,\ncountry and himself.” His treatment of demonism is written as an antidote to the outbreak\nof sorcery. This contagion was spreading at an alarming rate, thanks\nalso to the society’s growing yet harmful indifference. Bodin trained\nhis sights on Johann Wier (or Weyer; Piscinarius) the former servant\nof the famous master of occult Cornelius Agrippa and tutor to the\nchildren of Jeanne d’Albret (mother of Henry of Navarre, the future\nHenry IV). The work is divided into four books. The first introduces\nthe reader to his basic ideas: the definition of a sorcerer; the\nassociation of demons with men; the difference between good and bad\nspirits; the human and divine means of understanding the mysteries of\nthe occult, and the illicit means for influencing human events. The\nsecond book initiates the reader to magic in general and to silent and\nspoken invocations of evil spirits. Then he comes to the most debated\nquestions, are those who renounce God bodily possessed by demons?\nWhat is lycanthropy?  Can one change humans into animals?  Can\nsorcerers cause illness, sterility, hail, storms, the death of men and\nanimals?  Book III proposes licit remedies against charms and\nincantations, and considers whether it is true that sorcerers have the\npower to heal. Here Bodin also addresses whether sorcerers have the\nability to influence the finding of favor with the powerful, beauty,\nhonors, riches, knowledge, and fertility.  He discusses illicit means\nto prevent and heal evil spells, and the method for driving out evil\nspirits. The fourth book concludes the work by tackling the issues of\nmagical practice and most importantly, the inquisition of\nsorcerers. He examines the methods for proceeding against them, the\nproof required, and the penalties to be inflicted. In most cases Bodin\nrecommends the death penalty by burning. In the last years of his life Bodin dedicated himself ambitiously\nto his work, with which he hoped to penetrate the secrets of the\nuniverse. His Theater of Universal Nature (Theatrum)\nis a treatment of the science of nature, or natural philosophy.\nAccording to the title, the work addresses “in five books the\nefficient and final causes of all things of the world.” It is a\nwell-organized encyclopedia of universal knowledge in the form of a\ndialogue between Theorus, a curious theoretician who observers the\nworld and Mystagogus, a master and guide.  The first book examines the\nprincipals of nature and the origin and decline of the world. The\nsecond book addresses the natural elements of meteors, of rocks,\nmetals and fossils.  The third books explores types of animals; the\nfourth addresses the spirit, and the fifth book concerns the number,\nmovement, and grandeur of the heavens respectively. This is an example\nof those works of natural philosophy, which wished to be exhaustive,\nand were typical of the Renaissance. The accusations of naturalism and\natheism, which his Colloquium of the Seven About the Secrets of\nthe Sublime (Heptaplomeres) had provoked, were only\nreignited and expanded by the Theatrum, regardless of the\nfact that he repeatedly refers to an all-powerful creator who admires\nthe “order” in all things. Biographies have attributed religious, political, and philosophical\ndoctrines to Bodin that he may have held. These historians have even\nused the word “conversion”—a strong word in the\nsixteenth century—to make their point. Rose writes of Bodin’s\n“conversion to Judaism”; Moreau-Reibel and Rose of his\n“conversion to the League,” which according to Rose is an\n“act of apostasy” too. Bayle, Naef and Bouchez describe\nhis “conversion to Protestantism,” and Franklin of his\n“conversion to absolutism.” Likewise Bayle and Quaglioni\ndescribe Bodin’s tendency towards religious dissimulation or\nnicodemism. Within the confines of a biography, we are limited to\naddress only the most important aspects of Bodin’s character as a\npolitical actor including his adhesion to the League and his\nabandonment of the “politiques.” Concerning the first\npoint, his adhesion to the League, we have examined the Bodin’s\nposition based on his own writings. The second point, Bodin’s\nrelationship to the “politiques,” is based on suppositions\nwhich have become nearly a tradition in Bodin scholarship, and has\nbeen perpetuated and reinforced by generation after generation of\nhistorians. Unfortunately these historians have not sought sources on\nwhich to base this claim. In fact, there are no sources that support\nthis argument. Indeed, Bodin never said that he was a\n“politique.” Briefly addressing the heart of the matter,\nhistorians have sought to make Bodin a convinced partisan of religious\ntolerance. During Bodin’s lifetime however, religious tolerance,\ndefined as civil tolerance and a legal admission of confessional\ndiversity within a country or city, was not the ideal it would later\nbecome after the eighteenth century. In the sixteenth\ncentury, it was men like Sébastian Castellion who extolled the\nco-existence of many religions, with which the reformed camp\ndisagreed. The struggle of the Huguenots from the beginning of the\ncivil wars, was to convert the king and realm to the true religion.\nTolerance was not an ideal since one cannot tolerate what one cannot\npossibly accept. For example how could one allow Christ to coexist\nwith Belial, or a false religion to coexist with the one and only true\nreligion?  No further proof of this conviction is needed than the\nfierce struggle both Calvin and Beza waged against Castellion. This\nexample causes one to ask the question: if Castellion supported\nfreedom of religion, why did the leaders of the Reformation, who\nprofessed the same desire, denounce him so fervently?  Because, in the\nreality, the French Reformers did not want freedom of religion which\ncould have “opened the door to all manner of sects and\nheresies,” as Calvin said. At the beginning of the wars of\nreligion, they wanted to obtain the recognition of the reformed\nreligion as the sole religion in the realm. Yet, after thirty-six\nyears of war, and after the conversion of Henry of Navarre, they\nunderstood that their project was too ambitious and had to be\nlimited. Only through true religious tolerance could they convert the\nremainder of the kingdom at a later time.  The unity of faith, and\nCalvinist religious concord were the ideal of Reformers\ntoo. Concerning the “politiques,” we only have\ndescriptions of them from their adversaries who considered them\natheists and heathens. For instance they were accused of having no\nreligion because they were inclined to admit the definitive\ncoexistence of different forms of worship in the interest of civil\npeace. Nevertheless, why have modern historians, placed men, who they\nconsidered the “most liberal and sympathetic,” such as\nBodin, Etienne Pasquier, Duplessis-Mornay, Pierre de Beloy and many\nothers in the party of the “politiques.” These historians\nhave projected their modern ideals of tolerance, religious freedom,\npluralism, and diversity on to the period of the Wars of\nReligion. Thus these scholars believed they had done a great service\nto the men of the past by presenting them as forerunners of the later\nvalues.  But, as we have seen, Bodin viewed confessional concord as\nthe means capable of returning religious, civil and political unity to\nthe kingdom. It should be recalled however that the problem was not\nthat of “liberty of conscience,” which the French\ngovernment had already guaranteed by edicts in 1563, but the liberty\nto worship. The freedom to worship is also at the heart of the\nquestion of tolerance. When Bodin and many of his contemporaries\nthought about tolerance, it was only as provisional tolerance with the\nhope of achieving civil peace and religious reunification in the\nfuture. For Bodin, concord was essential since it formed the\nfoundation of sovereignty and was necessary for the full exercise of\npower.  To be fair to Bodin, the offenses poured out against him by his\nmalicious contemporaries at the time of his adhesion to the League\nshould be analyzed and understood historically. The same goes for the\naccusations of treason, turn-coating, trickery, opportunism,\n“the charge of his reversal of his belief on religious\ntolerance,” “his slipperiness and lack of principle in\njoining the League,” all of which we find today in his\nbiographies. Bodin’s program of concord and unity was in opposition to\npermanent tolerance and established diversity in juridical, political,\nand theological questions, as we already seen.  (1) A Judaising Catholic. Did Bodin’s passion for studying Judaic\ntexts arise principally from the influence of his Jewish mother? The\ntrail is a false one since his mother was not Jewish.  (2) Another\nfalse trail concerns how he had miraculously escaped the\nSt. Bartholomew massacre in Paris by seeking refuge with Christophle\nde Thou, the president of the Parlement of Paris — the story being\n“late and unverifiable”according to Jacquelin Boucher\n(1983). Paul Collinet, who maintained initially that Bodin was not in\nParis but in the county of Rethelois at the time (Collinet 1908,\n752), later revised his ideas: he had confused J. Bodin de Saint-Amand\n(our J. Bodin) with another, J. B. de Montguichet (Collinet\n1910). This was in accordance with the study of Paul Cornu (Cornu\n1907) about “two J. Bodins”.  Nevertheless, Cornu himself\ncannot say where our Bodin was at that\n time.[15]\n In fact, we know nothing for certain about Bodin on the famous night\nof August 24, 1572, nor is it not a matter of central historical\nimportance.  (3) Belief in Witchcraft. Bodin, like the majority of\npeople in the sixteenth century, believed in the devil and the power\nof Satan. These beliefs made his biographers, especially those of the\nnineteenth century, uneasy. They felt that such\nsuperstitions tarnished Bodin’s image.  Baudrillart criticized Bodin’s\nwork Demonomanie and wrote that “Absurd fanaticism,\nridiculous and obnoxious should be written in the margins of each page\nof this unfortunate book” (Baudrillart 1853, 184, 188–189).\nSuch vain preoccupations and a lack historical sense are two faults,\namong others, that distort the historical analysis of Bodin by those\nwho wish to make him a man of their time rather than allowing\nhim to be a man of his day. Some recent studies of the Heptaplomeres have tended to\ncast some doubt on Bodin’s authorship of this work. Even if the issue\nof his authorship has not been decisively resolved, one of the\nsecondary but beneficial consequences of these studies is that they\nhave increased our understanding of the on sources which the author of\nthis anonymous text drew — including not only\nthe Daemonomania as well as the other works by Bodin, but\nalso the writings of Johan Wier (1515–1588; Wier 1579).  The\nmost important studies questioninig Bodin’s authorship of the treatise\nare those by Karl F. Faltenbacher (2002, 2009) and David Wootton\n(2002), Jean Céard (2009) and Isabelle Pantin\n(2009). Refutations of this thesis, on the other hand, have been\npublished by Jean Letrouit (1995), Andrea Suggi (2005, 2006, 2007) and\nNoel Malcom (2006). Sometimes historical research progresses by leaps and bounds\ninstead of a gradual and steady evolution. Thanks to new research\n(Fontana 2009) we are now in a position to settle on certain issues in\nBodin’s life that have remained matters of conjecture until quite\nrecently, such as his supposed visit to Geneva in 1552 (on which, see\nbelow).  Biographers have been faced with a series of problems\nbecause, throughout his life, he was regularly confused with other\nindividuals also called Jean Bodin, not least within his own family:\nhe was the fourth of seven children, the second of whome was also\ncalled Jean (Levron 1950, 14). For this reason, he has often been\nassigned roles by historians which he may not have played.  He has\nbeen conflated, for instance, with a certain Jean Bodin arrested in\ntwo trials for heresy in Paris, one in 1547 and the other in 1548\n(Weiss 1889, 17–8; Naef; Droz; but see Levron 1948).  He has\nalso been confused with Jean Bodin de La Bodinière or\nMontguichet who, like our Jean Bodin, was an Angevin and a\ncommissioner for the reformation of forests in Normandy, as well as a\nmember of the household of the duke d’Alençon\n(cf. Chauviré, 33–4; Cornu 1907, 109–111 ; Holt 1986,\n41).  Among the avocats of the Parlement of Paris who swore\nan oath to uphold Catholism in 1562, there were two Jean Bodins, one\nof whom was ours (Delachenal 1885, 405–6).  Someone called Jean Bodin\nwas arrested at the priory of Saint-Denis-de-la-Chatre, rue\nSaint-Barthélemy in Paris on March 6, 1569, accused of being of\nthe new opinion’.  He was released on August 23, 1570 following the\nedict of pacification of Saint-Germain (Weiss 1923, 87-9; Droz 1948,\n79; Boucher 1983).  But this cannot be our Jean Bodin (De Caprariis\n1959, 325).  None of the various Jean Bodins of whom we have knowledge\naround 1569 — the student at Angers, the priest at Bourgueil in\nthe parish of Saint-Aubin du Pavoil near Segré, or the merchant\nat St-Maurice — correspond to the Jean Bodin in whom we are\ninterested (Levron 1948, 73–4).  Nor ashould we identify Jean Bodin\nthe philosopher with his various namesakes (Couzinet 1996, 240) who\nwere implicated in the trial of La Môle and Coconnas in 1574\n(Holt 1986, 41) or accompanied Brisson on a mission in 1581\n(Moreau-Reibel 1933, 258), or got mixed up in the Champvallon affair\nof the following year (Radouant 1970, 45) or were suspected of having\nparticipated in the Babington Plot against Elizabeth I of England\n(Rose 1980, 215–6). Equally, there is no tangible or demonstrable proof to support the\nsupposed Protestant leanings of Bodin.  Roger Chauviré (1914,\n24) speculated, on the basis of his hypothetical stay in Geneva in\n1552, that he had perhaps converted to the new faith.  This particular\nsupposition is linked to another, more general one, that Bodin had a\ntruly reformed religiosity, coexisting with his other judaising\ntendencies and inclinations towards natural religion. This is why\nthere is a persistent tendency among certain historians to perceive\nhim as a dissimulating Protestant and ‘Nicodemite’.\nFollowing Naef and Droz, they believe that Bodin can be identified\nwith ‘Jehan Bodin de Sainct-Amand diocese de Bourges’\n(following Bordier, who, however, provides no references to Jean\nBodin, author of the Republic) who spent time in Geneva in\n1552, asking to be received as inhabitant there, who married\nTyphène Renault and had an argument with Jérôme\nBolsec (Naef and Droz, 83) and who even became a minister of the Holy\nWord (Weiss, contradicted by Naef, 153; but see Droz, 83).  All these\nhypotheses, however, have been undermined now that Letizia Fontana\n(2009) has demonstrated that the Jean Bodin who was present in Geneva\nin 1552 cannot possibly have been the philosopher. That said, it still\nremains possible that Bodin occasionally felt sympathy, on the\nreligious grounds, towards Protestantism and Protestants in general,\nthough this stopped short of adherence to the confession of the\nReformed faith.  Such an attitude could often be found among moderate\nCatholics, men of letters, jurists, writers and even theologians and\nwas not in conflict with Bodin’s severely negative assessment —\non a purely political level — of the Huguenots as a result of\ntheir raising arms against their sovereign. \nIn 2013 two important Bodin editions appeared. Sara \nMiglietti published her doctoral dissertation (Scuola Normale\nSuperiore, Pisa): Jean Bodin, Methodus ad facilem historiarum\ncongnitione, edizione, introduzione e commento di S. Miglietti,\nPisa: Edizioni della Normale, with an accompanying Italian translation.\nIn addition, Mario Turchetti published a critical edition of the first\nbook of the French text of La République with a\nparallel Latin edition of  De \nRepublica, translated by Bodin and published in 1586 (see\nCotroneo 2014 ‘Il ritorno di Bodin’); N. de Araujo is\nresponsible for the text, and the preface is by Q. Skinner. This\nvolume, the first of a projected six volume edition, is now available\nonline from\nClassiques Garnier. \nIts publication was the occasion for an international conference at\nthe University of Fribourg (4–5 October 2013); and another is\nplanned for 5 March 2015, organized by the Universities of Paris-IV\nSorbonne (Denis Crouzet) and Paris-VI Descartes (Yves Charles\nZarka). \nAn international conference was held in Oxford in June 2014 (St\nAnne’s College): ‘Community, Government and Territoriality in the\nPolitical Thought of Jean Bodin’, organised by Sophie Nicholls\nand Anne Becker. \nThe Reception of Bodin, edited by Howell A.  Lloyd, was\npublished in Leiden by Brill in 2013. The volume presents the\nsixteenth-century jurist as a “prismatic agent” through\nwhose works a vast inherited juridical, philosophical, religious,\npolitical and anthropological fabric of learning of the West was\ndisseminated in a revitalised form into world ripe for modernity. \n\nAt Tufts University (Boston, USA), a ‘Bodin Project’ has\nnow been launched by Ioannis Evrigenis, the aim of which is to make\navailable online the French, Latin and English (Six Bookes of a\nCommonweale in Richard Knolly’s 1606 translation) texts of Bodin’s\nRepublic. The digitized editions produced by the ‘Bodin\nProject’ will, in due course, become part of the vast range of\nworks consultable online from the \n (Perseus Digital Library). \nAnother \n Bodin Project\n was originally based at the\nUniversity of Hull and is now based at Harvard. \n\nThe ‘Bodin Sources Project’, directed by Professor Kenneth\nD. McRae, aims to list the sources mentioned in five of Bodin’s major\nworks – Methodus, République,\nDémonomanie, Theatrum and the commentary on\nOppian – in machine-readable form. For further information,\ncontact: K. D. McRae, Department of Political Science, Carleton\nUniversity, 1125 Colonel by Drive, Ottawa ON K1S 5B6 Canada. \nThe hectic pace of Bodin studies has not let up in recent years; for\nbrevity’s sake, however, only the most important contributions\nwill be singled out here. Anna Di Bello (2014) traces in detail the\nway in which the Latin translation of La République\nwas made, providing a new understanding of Bodin’s elaboration\nof his masterpiece. The parallels between the French and Latin\nversions, the collation of the two texts, and the comparisons between\nthem provide the opportunity to evaluate Bodin’s preoccupations\nat two distinct moments in time.  Those preoccupations include his\nconceptions of the State and the optimal structure for the realization\nof a polity which, beyond the good ordering and right administration\nof society, ensures the exercise of a sovereignty that preserves\n‘harmonic justice’ in a royal monarchy such as\nFrance. Daniel Lee (2016) explores the Roman Law sources that underlie\nthe emergence, and rise to prominence, of the theory of popular\nsovereignty in the early modern period. In two chapters, he seeks to\nundermine the traditional idea that Bodin is an\n‘absolutist’ and tries to present him in a more authentic\nlight.  Howell A. Lloyd (2017) reconstructs the intellectual biography\nof Bodin in a novel way. Finally, Turchetti (2018) examines the\ndistinction between despotism and tyranny, which was essential to\nBodin as the juridico-political foundation of the right of resistance,\nbut which was progressively forgotten in later centuries. \nDespite this welcome resurgence of interest in Bodin, a remaining\ndeisderatum is a new English translation of Bodin’s\nRepublic, one which meets the needs of twenty-first-century\nresearchers.","contact.mail":"mario.turchetti@unifr.ch","contact.domain":"unifr.ch"}]
