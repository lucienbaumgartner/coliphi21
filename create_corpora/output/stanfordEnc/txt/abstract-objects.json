The distinction is\nsupposed to be of fundamental significance for metaphysics and\nepistemology. This article surveys a number of recent attempts to say\nhow it should be drawn.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe abstract/concrete distinction has a curious status in\ncontemporary philosophy. It is widely agreed that the distinction is of\nfundamental importance. And yet there is no standard account of how it\nshould be drawn. There is a great deal of agreement about how to\nclassify certain paradigm cases. Thus it is universally acknowledged\nthat numbers and the other objects of pure mathematics are abstract (if\nthey exist), whereas rocks and trees and human beings are concrete.\nSome clear cases of abstracta are classes, propositions, concepts,\nthe letter ‘A’, and Dante’s Inferno. Some clear\ncases of concreta are stars, protons, electromagnetic fields, the\nchalk tokens of the letter ‘A’ written on a certain \nblackboard, and James Joyce’s copy of Dante’s Inferno. \n\nThe challenge is to say what underlies this dichotomy, either by\ndefining the terms explicitly, or by embedding them in a theory that\nmakes their connections to other important categories more explicit. In\nthe absence of such an account, the philosophical significance of the\ncontrast remains uncertain. We may know how to classify things as\nabstract or concrete by appeal to intuition. But in the absence of\ntheoretical articulation, it will be hard to know what (if anything)\nhangs on the classification. \n\nIt should be stressed that there need not be one single\n“correct” way of explaining the abstract/concrete\ndistinction. Any plausible account will classify the paradigm\ncases in the standard way, and any interesting account will draw a\nclear and philosophically significant line in the domain of objects.\nYet there may be many equally interesting ways of accomplishing\nthese two goals, and if we find ourselves with two or more accounts\nthat do the job rather well, there will be no point in asking which\ncorresponds to the real abstract/concrete\ndistinction. This illustrates a general point: when\ntechnical terminology is introduced in philosophy by means of examples\nbut without explicit definition or theoretical elaboration, the\nresulting vocabulary is often vague or indeterminate in\nreference. In such cases, it is normally pointless to seek a\nsingle correct account. A philosopher may find himself asking\nquestions like, ‘What \\(is\\) idealism?’ or ‘What\n\\(is\\) a substance?’ and treating these questions as\ndifficult questions about the underlying nature of a certain\ndeterminate philosophical category. A better approach is to\nrecognize that in many cases of this sort, we simply have not made up\nour minds about how the term is to be understood, and that what we seek\nis not a precise account of what this term already means, but rather a\nproposal for how it might fruitfully be used in the\nfuture. Anyone who believes that something in the vicinity of the\nabstract/concrete distinction matters for philosophy would be well\nadvised to approach the project of explaining the distinction with this\nin mind. \n\nThe contemporary distinction between abstract and concrete is not an\nancient one. Indeed, there is a strong case for the view that despite\noccasional anticipations, it played no significant role in philosophy\nbefore the 20th century. The modern distinction bears some\nresemblance to Plato’s distinction between Forms and\nSensibles. But Plato’s Forms were supposed to be causes par\nexcellence, whereas abstract objects are generally supposed to be\ncausally inert in every sense. The original\n‘abstract’/‘concrete’ distinction was a\ndistinction among words or terms. Traditional grammar distinguishes\nthe abstract noun ‘whiteness’ from the concrete noun\n‘white’ without implying that this linguistic contrast\ncorresponds to a metaphysical distinction in what these words stand\nfor. In the 17th century this grammatical distinction was\ntransposed to the domain of ideas. Locke speaks of the general idea of\na triangle which is “neither Oblique nor Rectangle, neither\nEquilateral, Equicrural nor Scalenon [Scalene]; but all and none of\nthese at once,” remarking that even this idea is not among the\nmost “abstract, comprehensive and difficult” (Essay\nIV.vii.9). Locke’s conception of an abstract idea as one that is\nformed from concrete ideas by the omission of distinguishing detail\nwas immediately rejected by Berkeley and then by Hume. But even for\nLocke there was no suggestion that the distinction between abstract\nideas and concrete or particular ideas corresponds to a distinction\namong objects. “It is plain, …” Locke\nwrites, “that General and Universal, belong not to the real\nexistence of things; but are Inventions and Creatures of the\nUnderstanding, made by it for its own use, and concern only signs,\nwhether Words or Ideas” (III.iii.11). \n\nThe abstract/concrete distinction in its modern form is meant to\nmark a line in the domain of objects or entities. So conceived, the\ndistinction becomes a central focus for philosophical discussion only\nin the 20th century. The origins of this development are\nobscure, but one crucial factor appears to have been the breakdown of\nthe allegedly exhaustive distinction between the mental and the\nmaterial that had formed the main division for ontologically minded\nphilosophers since Descartes. One signal event in this development is\nFrege’s insistence that the objectivity and aprioricity of the truths\nof mathematics entail that numbers are neither material beings nor\nideas in the mind. If numbers were material things (or properties of\nmaterial things), the laws of arithmetic would have the status of\nempirical generalizations. If numbers were ideas in the mind, then the\nsame difficulty would arise, as would countless others. (Whose mind\ncontains the number 17? Is there one 17 in your mind and another in\nmine? In that case, the appearance of a common mathematical subject\nmatter is an illusion.) In The Foundations of Arithmetic\n(1884), Frege concludes that numbers are neither external\n‘concrete’ things nor mental entities of any sort. Later,\nin his essay “The Thought” (Frege 1918), he claims the same status for\nthe items he calls thoughts—the senses of declarative\nsentences—and also, by implication, for their constituents, the\nsenses of subsentential expressions. Frege does not say that senses are\n‘abstract’. He says that they belong to a ‘third realm’ distinct both\nfrom the sensible external world and from the internal world of\nconsciousness. Similar claims had been made by Bolzano (1837), and\nlater by Brentano (1874) and his pupils, including Meinong and Husserl.\nThe common theme in these developments is the felt need in semantics\nand psychology as well as in mathematics for a class of objective\n(i.e., non-mental) supersensible entities. As this new ‘realism’ was\nabsorbed into English speaking philosophy, the traditional term\n‘abstract’ was enlisted to apply to the denizens of this ‘third\nrealm’. \n\nPhilosophers who affirm the existence of abstract objects are sometimes\ncalled platonists; those who deny their existence are\nsometimes called nominalists.\nThis terminology is lamentable, since these words have\nestablished senses in the history of philosophy, where they denote\npositions that have little to do with the modern notion of an abstract\nobject. However, the contemporary senses of these terms are\nnow established, and so the reader should be aware of them. (In\nAnglophone philosophy, the most important source for this\nterminological innovation is Quine. See especially Goodman and Quine\n1947.) In this connection, it is essential to bear in mind that modern\nplatonists (with a small ‘p’) need not accept any of the\ndistinctive metaphysical and epistemological doctrines of Plato, just\nas modern nominalists need not accept the distinctive doctrines of the\nmedieval nominalists. Insofar as these terms are useful in\na contemporary setting, they stand for thin doctrines:\nplatonism is the thesis that there is at least one abstract object;\nnominalism is the thesis that the number of abstract objects is exactly\nzero (Field 1980). The details of this dispute are\ndiscussed in the article on nominalism in metaphysics. (See also the entry on \n platonism in metaphysics.)\nThe aim of the present article is not to describe the case for or\nagainst the existence of abstract objects, but rather to say what an\nabstract object would be if such things existed. \n\nFrege’s way of drawing the abstract/concrete distinction is an\ninstance of what Lewis (1986a) calls the Way of\nNegation, according to which abstract objects are defined as\nthose which lack certain features possessed by paradigmatic\nconcrete objects. Nearly every explicit characterization in\nthe literature follows this model. Let us review some of the\noptions. \n\nAccording to the account implicit in Frege’s writings, \nAn object is abstract if and only if it is both non-mental and\nnon-sensible. \n\nHere the first challenge is to say what it means for a thing to be\n‘non-mental’, or as we more commonly say,\n‘mind-independent’. The simplest approach is to\nsay that a thing depends on the mind when it would not (or could not)\nhave existed if minds had not existed. But this entails that\ntables and chairs are mind-dependent, and that is not what philosophers\nwho employ this notion have in mind. To call an object\n‘mind-dependent’ in a metaphysical context is to suggest\nthat it somehow owes its existence to mental activity, but not in the\nboring ‘causal’ sense in which ordinary artifacts owe their\nexistence to the mind. What can this mean? One promising\napproach is to say that an object should be reckoned mind-dependent\nwhen, by its very nature, it exists at a time if and only if it\nis the object or content of some mental state or process at that\ntime. This counts tables and chairs as\nmind-independent, since they might survive the annihilation of thinking\nthings. But it counts paradigmatically mental items, like the\npurple afterimage of which I am now aware, as mind-dependent, since it\npresumably lies in the nature of such items to be objects of conscious\nawareness whenever they exist. However, it is not clear\nthat this account captures the full force of the intended notion.\nConsider, for example, the mereological fusion of my afterimage and\nyour headache. This is surely a mental entity if anything\nis. But it is not necessarily the object of a mental state. (The\nfusion can exist even if no one is thinking about\n\\(it\\).) A more generous conception would allow for\nmind-dependent objects that exist at a time in virtue of mental activity\nat that time, even if the object is not the object of any single mental\nstate or act. The fusion of my afterimage plus your headache\nis mind-dependent in the second sense but not the first.\nThat is a reason to prefer the second account of mind-dependence. \n\nIf we understand the notion of mind-dependence in this way, it is a\nmistake to insist that abstract objects be mind-independent. To strike\na theme that will recur, it is widely supposed that sets and classes\nare abstract entities—even the\nimpure sets whose urelements are concrete objects. Any\naccount of the abstract/concrete distinction that places set-theoretic\nconstructions like \\(\\{\\)Alfred, \\(\\{\\)Betty, \\(\\{\\)Charlie,\nDeborah\\(\\}\\}\\}\\) on the concrete side of the line will be seriously\nat odds with standard usage. With this in mind, consider the set whose\nsole members are my afterimage and your headache, or some more complex\nset-theoretic object based on these items. If we suppose, as is\nplausible, that an impure set exists at a time only when its members\nexist at that time, this will be a mind-dependent entity in the\ngenerous sense. But it is also presumably an abstract entity. \n\n A\nsimilar problem arises for so-called abstract\nartifacts, like Jane Austen’s novels and the characters\nthat inhabit them. Some philosophers regard such items as\neternally existing abstract entities that worldly authors merely\n‘describe’ or ‘encode’ but do not\ncreate. But of course the commonsensical view is that\nAusten created Pride and Prejudice and Elizabeth Bennett, and\nthere is no good reason to deny this (Thomasson 1999; cf. Sainsbury\n2009). \n\nIf we take this commonsensical approach, there will be a clear sense\nin which these items depend for their existence on Austen’s\nmental activity, and perhaps on the mental activity of subsequent\nreaders. These items may not count as mind-dependent in either of the\nsenses canvassed above, since Pride and Prejudice can\npresumably exist at a time even if no one happens to be thinking at\nthat time. (If the world took a brief collective nap,\nPride and Prejudice would not pop out of existence.) But\nthey are obviously mind-dependent in some not-merely-causal\nsense. And yet they are still presumably abstract objects.\nFor these reasons, it is probably a mistake to insist that abstract\nobjects be mind-independent. (For more on mind-dependence,\nsee Rosen 1994.) \n\nFrege’s proposal in its original form also fails for other\nreasons. Quarks and electrons are neither sensible nor\nmind-dependent. And yet they are not abstract objects. A\nbetter version of Frege’s proposal would hold that: \n\nAn object is abstract if and only if it is both non-physical and\nnon-mental. \n\nThis approach may well draw an important line; but it inherits the\nfamiliar problem of saying what it is for a thing to be a\nphysical object (Crane and Mellor 1990). For discussion,\nsee the entry on physicalism. \n\nContemporary purveyors of the Way of Negation typically amend\nFrege’s criterion by requiring that abstract objects be\nnon-spatial, causally inefficacious,\nor both. Indeed, if any characterization of the abstract deserves\nto be regarded as the standard one, it is this: \nAn object is abstract if and only if it is non-spatial and causally\ninefficacious. \n\nThis standard account nonetheless presents a number of\nperplexities. \n\nConsider first the requirement that abstract objects be non-spatial (or\nnon-spatiotemporal). Some of the paradigms of abstractness\nare non-spatial in a straightforward sense. It makes no\nsense to ask where the cosine function was last Tuesday. Or if it\nmakes sense to ask, the only sensible answer is that it was\nnowhere. Similarly, it makes no good sense to ask when the\nPythagorean Theorem came to be. Or if it does make sense to ask,\nthe only sensible answer is that it has always existed, or perhaps\nthat it does not exist ‘in time’ at all. These\nparadigmatic ‘pure abstracta’ have no non-trivial spatial\nor temporal properties. They have no spatial location, and they\nexist nowhere in particular in time. \n\nHowever, some abstract objects appear to stand in a more interesting\nrelation to space. Consider the game of chess, for example. Some\nphilosophers will say that chess is like a mathematical object,\nexisting nowhere and ‘no when’—either eternally or\noutside of time altogether. But that is not the most natural view. The\nnatural view is that chess was invented at a certain time and place\n(though it may be hard to say exactly where or when); that before it\nwas invented it did not exist at all; that it was imported from India\ninto Persia in the 7th century; that it has changed over\nthe years, and so on. The only reason to resist this natural account\nis the thought that since chess is clearly an abstract\nobject—it’s not a physical object, after all!—and since\nabstract objects do not exist in space and time—by\ndefinition!—chess must resemble the cosine function in its\nrelation to space and time. And yet one might with equal justice\nregard the case of chess and other abstract artifacts as\ncounterexamples to the hasty view that abstract objects possess only\ntrivial spatial and temporal properties. \n\nShould we then abandon the non-spatiotemporality criterion? Not\nnecessarily. Even if there is a sense in which some abstract\nentities possess non-trivial spatiotemporal properties, it might still\nbe said that concrete entities exist in spacetime in a distinctive\nway. If we had an account of this distinctive\nmanner of spatiotemporal existence characteristic of concrete\nobjects, we could say: An object is abstract (if and) only if it\nfails to exist in spacetime in that way. \n\nOne way to implement this approach is to note that paradigmatic\nconcrete objects tend to occupy a relatively determinate spatial volume\nat each time at which they exist, or a determinate volume of spacetime\nover the course of their existence. It makes sense to ask of such\nan object, ‘Where is it now, and how much space does it\noccupy?’ even if the answer must sometimes be somewhat\nvague. By contrast, even if the game of chess is somehow\n‘implicated’ in space and time, it makes no sense to ask\nhow much space it now occupies. (To the extent that this does\nmake sense, the only sensible answer is that it occupies no space at\nall, which is not to say that it occupies a spatial\npoint.) And so it might be said: \nAn object is abstract (if and) only if it fails to occupy anything like\na determinate region of space (or spacetime). \n\nThis promising idea raises several questions. First, it is\nconceivable that certain items that are standardly regarded as abstract\nmight nonetheless occupy determinate volumes of space and\ntime. Consider, for example, the various sets composed from\nPeter and Paul: \\(\\{\\)Peter, Paul\\(\\}, \\{\\)Peter, \\(\\{\\)Peter, \\(\\{\\{\\)Paul\\(\\}\\}\\}\\}\\),\netc. We don’t normally ask where such things are, or how\nmuch space they occupy. And indeed many philosophers will\nsay that the question makes no sense, or that the answer is a\ndismissive ‘nowhere, none’. But this answer is\nnot forced upon us by anything in set theory or\nmetaphysics. Even if we grant that pure sets stand\nin only the most trivial relations to space, it is open to us to hold,\nas some philosophers have done, that impure sets exist where and when\ntheir members do (Lewis 1986a). It is not unnatural to say\nthat a set of books is located on a certain shelf in the library,\nand indeed, there are some theoretical reasons for wanting to say this\n(Maddy 1990). On a view of this sort, we face a choice: we\ncan say that since impure sets exist in space, they are not abstract\nobjects after all; or we can say that since impure sets are abstract,\nit was a mistake to suppose that abstract objects cannot occupy\nspace. \n\nOne way to finesse this difficulty would be to note that even if impure\nsets occupy space, they do so in a derivative manner. The set\n\\(\\{\\)Peter, Paul\\(\\}\\) occupies a location in virtue of the fact that its concrete\nelements, Peter and Paul, together occupy that location. The set\ndoes not occupy the location in its own right.\nWith that in mind, it might be said that: \nAn object is abstract (if and) only if it either fails to occupy space\nat all, or does so only in virtue of the fact some other\nitems—in this case, its urelements—occupy that region. \n\nBut of course Peter himself occupies a region in virtue of the fact\nthat his parts—his head, hands, etc.—together\noccupy that region. So a better version of the proposal would\nsay: \nAn object is abstract (if and) only if it either fails to occupy space\nat all, or does so of the fact that some other items that are not\namong its parts occupy that region. \n\nThis approach appears to classify the cases fairly well, but it is\nsomewhat artificial. Moreover it raises a number of\nquestions. What are we to say about the statue that occupies a\nregion of space, not because its parts are arrayed in space,\nbut rather because its constituting matter occupies that\nregion? And what about the unobserved electron, which according to some\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics does not really occupy a\nregion of space at all, but rather stands in some more exotic relation\nto the spacetime it inhabits? Suffice it to say that a\nphilosopher who regards ‘non-spatiality’ as a mark of the\nabstract, but who allows that some abstract objects may have\nnon-trivial spatial properties, owes us an account of the\ndistinctive relation to space and spacetime that sets\nparadigmatic concreta apart. \n\nPerhaps the most important question about the\n‘non-spatiality’ criterion concerns the classification of\nthe parts of space itself. Let us suppose that space or spacetime\nexists, not just as an object of pure mathematics, but as the arena in\nwhich physical objects and events are somehow arrayed. Physical\nobjects are located ‘in’ or ‘at’ regions of\nspace, and so count as concrete according to the non-spatiality\ncriterion. But what about the points and regions of space\nitself? There has been some debate about whether a commitment to\nspacetime substantivalism is consistent with the nominalist’s\nrejection of abstract entities (Field 1980, 1989; Malament\n1982). If we define the abstract as the\n‘non-spatial’, this debate reduces to the question whether\nspace itself is to be reckoned ‘spatial’. But surely\nthat is a verbal question. We can extend existing usage so as to\nallow that points and regions of space are located ‘at’\nthemselves—or not, according to taste. The philosopher\nwho thinks that there is a serious question about whether the parts of\nspace count as concrete would thus do well to characterize the\nabstract/concrete distinction in other terms. \n\nAccording to the most widely accepted versions of the Way of\nNegation: \nAn object is abstract (if and) only if it is causally\ninefficacious. \nConcrete objects, whether mental or physical, have causal powers;\nnumbers and functions and the rest make nothing happen. There is no\nsuch thing as causal commerce with the game of chess itself (as\ndistinct from its concrete instances). And even if impure sets do in\nsome sense exist in space, it is easy enough to believe that they make\nno distinctive causal contribution to what transpires. Peter\nand Paul may have effects individually. They may even have effects\ntogether that neither has on his own. But these joint effects are\nnaturally construed as effects of two concrete objects acting jointly,\nor perhaps as effects of their mereological aggregate (itself a\nparadigm concretum), rather than as effects of some set-theoretic\nconstruction. Suppose Peter and Paul together tip a balance. If we\nentertain the possibility that this event is caused by a set, we shall\nhave to ask which set caused it: the set containing just Peter and\nPaul? Some more elaborate construction based on them? Or is it perhaps\nthe set containing the molecules that compose Peter and Paul? This\nproliferation of possible answers suggests that it was a mistake to\ncredit sets with causal powers in the first place. This is good news\nfor those who wish to say that all sets are abstract. \n\n(Note, however, that some writers identify ordinary physical\nevents—causally efficacious items par excellence—with\nsets. For David Lewis, for example, an event like the fall of Rome is\nan ordered pair whose first member is a region of spacetime, and whose\nsecond member is a set of such regions (Lewis 1986b). On this\naccount, it would be disastrous to say both that impure sets are\nabstract objects, and that abstract objects are non-causal.) \n\nThe idea that causal inefficacy constitutes a sufficient\ncondition for abstractness is somewhat at odds with standard\nusage. Some philosophers believe in ‘epiphenomenal\nqualia’: objects of conscious awareness (sense data), or\nqualitative conscious states that may be caused by physical processes\nin the brain, but which have no downstream causal consequences of their\nown (Jackson 1982; Chalmers 1996). These items are causally\ninefficacious if they exist, but they are not normally regarded as\nabstract. The proponent of the causal inefficacy criterion\nmight respond by insisting that abstract objects are distinctively\nneither causes nor effects. But this is\nperilous. Abstract artifacts like Jane Austen’s novels (as\nwe normally conceive them) come into being as a result of\nhuman activity. The same goes for impure sets, which come into\nbeing when their concrete urelements are created. These items are\nclearly effects in some good sense; yet they remain abstract\nif they exist at all. It is unclear how the proponent of the strong\nversion of the causal inefficacy criterion (which views causal\ninefficacy as both necessary and sufficient for abstractness) might\nbest respond to this problem. \n\nApart from this worry, there are no decisive intuitive\ncounterexamples to this account of the abstract/concrete distinction.\nThe chief difficulty—and it is hardly decisive—is rather\nconceptual. It is widely maintained that causation, strictly\nspeaking, is a relation among events or states of affairs. If we\nsay that the rock—an object—caused the window to break,\nwhat we mean is that some event or state (or fact or condition)\ninvolving the rock caused the break. If the rock itself is\na cause, it is a cause in some derivative sense. But this derivative\nsense has proved elusive. The rock’s hitting the window is an event in\nwhich the rock ‘participates’ in a certain way, and it is because the\nrock participates in events in this way that we credit the rock itself\nwith causal efficacy. But what is it for an object to\nparticipate in an event? Suppose John is thinking about the\nPythagorean Theorem and you ask him to say what’s on his mind. His\nresponse is an event—the utterance of a sentence; and one\nof its causes is the event of John’s thinking about the theorem. Does\nthe Pythagorean Theorem ‘participate’ in this event? There is surely\nsome sense in which it does. The event consists in John’s\ncoming to stand in a certain relation to the theorem, just as the\nrock’s hitting the window consists in the rock’s coming to stand in a\ncertain relation to the glass. But we do not credit the Pythagorean\nTheorem with causal efficacy simply because it participates in this\nsense in an event which is a cause. The challenge is therefore to\ncharacterize the distinctive manner of ‘participation in the causal\norder’ that distinguishes the concrete entities. This problem has\nreceived relatively little attention. There is no reason to believe\nthat it cannot be solved. But in the absence of a solution, this\nstandard version of the Way of Negation must be reckoned a work in\nprogress. \n\nIn addition to the Way of Negation, Lewis identifies three main\nstrategies for explaining the abstract/concrete distinction. According\nto the Way of Example, it suffices to list paradigm\ncases of abstract and concrete entities in the hope that the sense of\nthe distinction will somehow emerge. If the distinction were primitive\nand unanalyzable, this might be the only way to explain it. But as we\nhave remarked, this approach is bound to call the interest of the\ndistinction into question. The abstract/concrete distinction matters\nbecause abstract objects as a class appear to present certain general\nproblems in epistemology and the philosophy of language. It is supposed\nto be unclear how we come by our knowledge of abstract objects in a\nsense in which it is not unclear how we come by our knowledge of\nconcrete objects (Benacerraf 1973). It is supposed to be unclear how we\nmanage to refer determinately to abstract entities in a sense in which\nit is not unclear how we manage to refer determinately to other things\n(Benacerraf 1973, Hodes 1984). But if these are genuine problems, there\nmust be some account of why abstract objects as such should be\nespecially problematic in these ways. It is hard to believe that it is\nsimply their primitive abstractness that makes the difference. It is\nmuch easier to believe that it is their non-spatiality or their causal\ninefficacy or something of the sort. It is not out of the question that\nthe abstract/concrete distinction is fundamental, and that the Way of\nExample is the best we can do by way of elucidation. But if so, it is\nquite unclear why the distinction should make a difference. \n\nAccording to the Way of Conflation, the\nabstract/concrete distinction is to be identified with one or another\nmetaphysical distinction already familiar under another name: as it\nmight be, the distinction between sets and individuals, or the\ndistinction between universals and particulars. There is no doubt that\nsome authors have used the terms in this way. (Thus Quine 1953 uses\n‘abstract entity’ and ‘universal’\ninterchangeably.) This sort of conflation is however rare in\nrecent philosophy. \n\nThe most important alternative to the Way of Negation is what Lewis\ncalls the Way of Abstraction. According to a longstanding\ntradition in philosophical psychology, abstraction is a distinctive\nmental process in which new ideas or conceptions are formed by\nconsidering several objects or ideas and omitting the features that\ndistinguish them. For example, if one is given a range of white things\nof varying shapes and sizes; one ignores or ‘abstracts\nfrom’ the respects in which they differ, and thereby attains the\nabstract idea of whiteness. Nothing in this tradition requires that\nideas formed in this way represent or correspond to a distinctive kind\nof object. But it might be maintained that the distinction between\nabstract and concrete objects should be explained by reference to the\npsychological process of abstraction or something like it. The\nsimplest version of this strategy would be to say that an object is\nabstract if it is (or might be) the referent of an abstract idea,\ni.e., an idea formed by abstraction. \n\nSo conceived, the Way of Abstraction is wedded to an outmoded\nphilosophy of mind. But a related approach has gained considerable\ncurrency in recent years. Crispin Wright (1983) and Bob Hale (1987)\nhave developed an account of abstract objects that takes leave from\ncertain suggestive remarks in Frege (1884). Frege notes (in effect)\nthat many of the singular terms that appear to refer to abstract\nentities are formed by means of functional expressions. We speak of\nthe shape of a building, the direction of a line,\nthe number of books on the shelf. Of course many singular\nterms formed by means of functional expressions denote ordinary\nconcrete objects: ‘the father of Plato’, ‘the capital of France’. But\nthe functional terms that pick out abstract entities are distinctive in\nthe following respect: Where ‘\\(f(a)\\)’ is\nsuch an expression, there is typically an equation of the form \n\nwhere \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation. (An equivalence\nrelation is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.)\nFor example: \nThe direction of \\(a =\\) the direction of \\(b\\) if and\nonly if \\(a\\) is parallel to \\(b\\). \nThe number of \\(F\\)s = the number of \\(G\\)s if and only if\nthere are just as many \\(F\\)s as \\(G\\)s. \nMoreover, these equations (or abstraction principles) appear\nto have a special semantic status. While they are not strictly\nspeaking definitions of the functional expression that occurs\non the left hand side, they would appear to hold in virtue of the\nmeaning of that expression. To understand the term\n‘direction’ is (in part) to know that ‘the direction\nof \\(a\\)’ and ‘the direction of \\(b\\)’ refer to the\nsame entity if and only if the lines \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are\nparallel. Moreover, the equivalence relation that appears on the right\nhand side of the equation would appear to be semantically and perhaps\nepistemologically prior to the functional expression on the left\n(Noonan 1978). Mastery of the concept of a direction presupposes\nmastery of the concept of parallelism, but not vice versa. \n\nThe availability of abstraction principles meeting these conditions\nmay be exploited to yield an account of the distinction between\nabstract and concrete objects. When ‘\\(f\\)’ is a\nfunctional expression governed by an abstraction principle, there will\nbe a corresponding kind \\(K_f\\) such that: \n\nFor example, \\(x\\) is a cardinal number if and only if for some concept\n\\(F, x =\\) the number of \\(Fs\\). The simplest version of this approach to the\nWay of Abstraction is then to say that \n\\(x\\) is an abstract object if (and only if) \\(x\\) is an\ninstance of some kind \\(K_f\\)\nwhose associated functional expression ‘\\(f\\)’ is\ngoverned by a suitable abstraction principle. \n\nThe strong version of this account—which purports to\nidentify a necessary condition for abstractness—is\nseriously at odds with standard usage. As we have noted, pure sets are\nparadigmatic abstract objects. But it is not clear that they satisfy\nthe proposed criterion. According to naïve set theory, the\nfunctional expression ‘set of’ is indeed characterized by a\nputative abstraction principle. \n The set of \\(F\\)s = the set of \\(G\\)s\nif and only if, for all \\(x, (x\\) is \\(F\\) if and\nonly if \\(x\\) is \\(G)\\). \n\nBut this principle is inconsistent, and so fails to characterize an\ninteresting concept. In contemporary mathematics, the concept of a set\nis not introduced by abstraction. It remains an open question whether\nsomething like the mathematical concept of a set can be characterized\nby a suitably restricted abstraction principle. (See Burgess 2005 for a\nsurvey of recent efforts in this direction.) Even if such a principle\nis available, however, it is unlikely that the epistemological priority\ncondition will be satisfied. (That is, it is unlikely that mastery of\nthe concept of set will presuppose mastery of the equivalence relation\nthat figures on the right hand side.) It is therefore uncertain whether\nthe Way of Abstraction so understood will classify the objects of pure\nset theory as abstract entities (as it presumably must). \n\n Similarly, as Dummett (1973) has noted, in many\ncases the standard names for paradigmatically abstract objects do not\nassume the functional form to which the definition adverts. Chess is an\nabstract entity. But we do not understand the word ‘chess’ as\nsynonymous with an expression of the form ‘\\(f(x)\\)’\nwhere ‘\\(f\\)’ is governed by an abstraction principle. Similar\nremarks would seem to apply to such things as the English language,\nsocial justice, architecture, and Charlie Parker’s style. If so,\nthe abstractionist approach does not provide a necessary\ncondition for abstractness as that notion is standardly understood. \n\nMore importantly, there is some reason to believe that it fails to\nsupply a sufficient condition. A mereological fusion of\nconcrete objects is itself a concrete object. But the concept of a\nmereological fusion is governed by what appears to be an abstraction\nprinciple: \n\nThe fusion of the \\(F\\)s = the fusion of the \\(G\\)s if and\nonly if the \\(F\\)s and \\(G\\)s cover one another, \n\nwhere the \\(F\\)s cover the \\(G\\)s if and only if every part of every\n\\(G\\) has a part in common with an \\(F\\). Similarly, suppose a train\nis a maximal string of railroad carriages, all of which are connected\nto one another. We may define a functional expression, ‘the\ntrain of \\(x\\)’, by means of an ‘abstraction’\nprinciple: The train of \\(x =\\) the train of \\(y\\) iff (if and only\nif) \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are connected carriages. We may then say that\n\\(x\\) is a train iff for some carriage \\(y\\), \\(x\\) is the train of\n\\(y\\). The simple account thus yields the consequence that trains are\nto be reckoned abstract entities. \n\nIt is unclear whether these objections apply to the more\nsophisticated abstractionist proposals of Wright and Hale, but one\nfeature of the simple account sketched above clearly does apply to\nthese proposals and may serve as the basis for an objection to this\nversion of the Way of Abstraction. The neo-Fregean approach seeks\nto explain the abstract/concrete distinction in semantic\nterms: We said that an abstract object is an object that falls in the\nrange of a functional expression governed by an abstraction principle,\nwhere ‘\\(f\\)’ is governed by an abstraction\nprinciple when that principle holds in virtue of the meaning\nof ‘\\(f\\)’. This notion of a statement’s\nholding in virtue of the meaning of a word is notoriously\nproblematic (see the entry on the \n analytic-synthetic distinction).\nBut even if this notion makes sense, one may still complain: The\nabstract/concrete distinction is supposed to be a metaphysical\ndistinction; abstract objects are supposed to differ from other objects\nin some important ontological respect. It should be possible,\nthen, to draw the distinction directly in metaphysical terms: to say\nwhat it is in the objects themselves that makes some things\nabstract and others concrete. As Lewis writes, in response to a related\nproposal by Dummett: \n\n Even if this … way\nsucceeds in drawing a border, as for all I know it may, it tells us\nnothing about how the entities on opposite sides of that border differ\nin their nature. It is like saying that snakes are the animals that we\ninstinctively most fear—maybe so, but it tells us\nnothing about the nature of snakes. (Lewis 1986a: 82) \n\nThe challenge is to produce a non-semantic version of the\nabstractionist criterion that specifies directly, in metaphysical\nterms, what the objects whose canonical names are governed by\nabstraction principles all have in common. \n\nOne response to this difficulty is to transpose the abstractionist\nproposal into more metaphysical key. We begin with the idea that each\nFregean number is, by its very nature, the number of some Fregean\nconcept, just as each Fregean direction is, by its very\nnature, at least potentially the direction of some concrete line.  In\neach case, the abstract object is essentially the value of an\nabstraction function for a certain class of arguments. This is not a\nclaim about the meanings of linguistic expressions. It is a claim\nabout the essences or natures of the objects themselves. (For the\nrelevant notion of essence, see Fine 1994). So for example, the\nFregean number two (if there is such a thing) is, essentially, by its\nvery nature, the number that belongs to a concept \\(F\\) if and only if\nthere are exactly two \\(F\\)s. More generally, for each Fregean\nabstract object \\(x\\), there is an abstraction function \\(f\\), such\nthat \\(x\\) is essentially the value of \\(f\\) for every argument of a\ncertain kind. \n\nAbstraction functions have two key features. First, for each\nabstraction function \\(f\\) there is an equivalence relation \\(R\\) such that it\nlies in the nature of \\(f\\) that \\(f(x) = f(y)\\) iff Rxy.\nIntuitively, we are to think that \\(R\\) is metaphysically prior to \\(f\\), and\nthat the abstraction function \\(f\\) is defined (in whole or in\npart) by this biconditional. Second, each abstraction\nfunction is a generating function: its values are essentially\nvalues of that function. Many functions are not generating\nfunctions. Paris is the capital of France, but it is not\nessentially a capital. The number of solar planets, by\ncontrast, is essentially a number. The notion of an\nabstraction function may be defined in terms of these two features: \n\nWe may then say that \n\n \\(x\\)\nis an abstraction if and only if, for some abstraction\nfunction \\(f\\), there is or could be an object \\(y\\) such that \\(x = f(y)\\) And \n \\(x\\)\nis an abstract object if (and only if) \\(x\\) is an abstraction. \n\nThis account tells us a great deal about the distinctive natures of\nthese broadly Fregean abstract objects. It tells us that\neach is, by its very nature, the value of a special sort of function,\none whose nature is specified in a simple way in terms of an associated\nequivalence relation. It is worth stressing, however, that\nit does not supply much metaphysical information about these\nitems. It doesn’t tell us whether they are located in space, whether\nthey can stand in causal relations, and so on. It is an\nopen question whether this somewhat unfamiliar version of the\nabstract/concrete distinction lines up with any of the more\nconventional ways of drawing the distinction outlined above. \n\nPutnam (1975) makes the case for abstract objects on scientific\ngrounds. Field (1980, 1989) makes the case against abstract\nobjects. Bealer (1993) and Tennant (1997) present a priori\narguments for the necessary existence of abstract entities. Balaguer\n(1998) argues that none of the arguments for or against the existence\nof abstract objects is compelling, and that there is no fact of the\nmatter as to whether abstract things exist. The dispute over the\nexistence of abstracta is reviewed in Burgess and Rosen (1997). Fine\n(2002) is a systematic study of abstraction principles in the\nfoundations of mathematics. A general theory of abstract objects is\ndeveloped axiomatically in Zalta (1983; 2016 in Other Internet\nResources).  Wetzel (2009) examines the type-token distinction, argues\nthat types are abstract objects while the tokens of those types are\ntheir concrete instances, and shows how difficult it is to paraphrase\naway the many references to types that occur in the sciences and\nnatural language. (See the entry on \n types and tokens.) \nMoltmann (2013) investigates the extent to which abstract objects are\nneeded when developing a semantics of natural language. "}]
