Whereas his mathematical works and\npoetry have been the subject of much discussion, his recently edited\nand published philosophical works have remained a largely neglected\narea of study. In what follows, we shall review and comment on the\nsalient features of Khayyam’s poetry and philosophy, their\nrelationship with one another, and Khayyam’s pioneering views on\nmathematics.\n\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Umar Khayyam’s significance in the annals\nof Islamic intellectual tradition is due to, his\nRubā‘iyyāt (quatrains) and his scientific works,\nespecially those in the field of mathematics. The latter have always\nbeen overshadowed by his poetry. In recent years, critical\neditions of the philosophical works of Khayyam have been published\nwhich not only provide us with an insight into his philosophical\nthought but also provide a context for a more philosophical\ninterpretation of the Rubā‘iyyāt.\n\n\n\nIn his Rubā‘iyyāt, Khayyam challenged\nreligious doctrines, alluded to the hypocrisy of the clergy, cast\ndoubt on almost every facet of religious belief, and appears to have\nadvocated a type of humanism. It is no wonder that some referred to\nhim as the “Eastern Voltaire” (Dole 1901, 81). This\nWestern image, solidified by the Victorian sense of the exotic,\nromantic, and often erotic notions attached to the East, was echoed\nthrough the rendition of the Rubā‘iyyāt by\nEdward FitzGerald in the 19th century.\n\nAbu'l Fatḥ Umar ibn Ibrāhīm\nKhayyām, commonly known as Umar Khayyām, is almost certainly\nthe best known Iranian poet-scientist in the West. He was born in the\ndistrict of Shādyakh of Nayshābūr (originally\n“Nayshāpūr”) in the province of\nKhorāsān sometime around 439 AH/1048\n CE,1\nand died there between 515 and 520 AH/1124 and 1129\n CE.2\nConsidering the word “Khayyām,” means\n“tent maker,” it is likely that his father\nIbrāhīm or forefathers were tent makers. Khayyām is said\nto have been quiet, reserved, and humble. His reluctance to accept\nstudents drew criticism from opponents, who claimed that he was\nimpatient, bad tempered, and uninterested in sharing his knowledge.\nGiven the radical nature of his views in the\nRubā‘iyyāt, he may merely have wished to remain\nintellectually inconspicuous. \nThe secrets which my book of love has bred, Cannot be told for\nfear of loss of head; Since none is fit to learn, or cares to\nknow, ‘Tis better all my thoughts remain\nunsaid. (Rubā‘iyyāt, Tirtha 1941 p. 266.) Khayyam’s reference to Ibn Sīnā\nas “his teacher” has led some to speculate that he actually\nstudied with Ibn Sīnā. Although this is incorrect, several\ntraditional biographers indicate that Umar Khayyam may have\nstudied with Bahmanyār, an outstanding student of Ibn\nSīnā.3 \n\n       Following a number of journeys to Herat,\nRay, and Iṣfahān (the latter being the capital of the\nSeljuqs) in search of libraries and in pursuit of astronomical\ncalculations, Khayyam’s declining health caused him to\nreturn to Nayshābūr, where he died in the district of\nShādyākh.    \n\nKhayyam wrote little, but his works—some fourteen\ntreatises identified to date—were remarkable. They can be\ncategorized primarily in three genres: mathematics, philosophy, and\npoetry. His philosophical works which have been edited and published\nrecently are: \n\nExcept the first work mentioned above which is a free translation\nand commentary on a discourse by Ibn Sīnā, the other six\nphilosophical treatises represent Khayyam’s own independent\nphilosophical views. It is noteworthy that\nKhayyam’s philosophical treatises were written in the\nPeripatetic tradition at a time when philosophy in general and\nrationalism in particular was under attack by orthodox Muslim\njurists—so much that Khayyam had to defend himself against\nthe charge of “being a philosopher.” \n “A philosopher I am,” my enemies falsely say,\n But God knows I am not what they say;\n While in this sorrow-laden nook, I reside\n   Need to know who I am, and why Here stay. (translation\nby the author.) \n\nIn “On Being and Necessity”, Khayyam defines\n“philosophy” along the Peripatetic line: “The\nessential and real issues that are discussed in philosophy are three,\n[first], ‘is it?’…second, ‘what is\nit?’…third, ‘why is it?’” (Mālik\n(ed.), 335). While these are standard Aristotelian questions,\nfor Khayyam they have a wider range of philosophical implications,\nespecially with regard to the following topics:  \n\nIn accordance with Peripatetic tradition, Umar Khayyam refers\nto God as the “Necessary Being” and offers\nseveral\n cosmological,5\nteleological, and ontological\n(Risālah fi'l-wujūd, 112) arguments for\nHis existence. Khayyam discusses issues such as necessity,\ncausality, and the impossibility of a chain of causes and effects\ncontinuing ad infinitum. Among other topics pertaining to God which\nKhayyam discusses are God’s knowledge of universals and\nparticulars and the complex nature of Divine essence. \n\nFor Khayyam, the most complex philosophical problem is to\naccount for the gradation of beings and the manner in which they are\nranked in terms of their nobility.   In “On Being and Necessity”,\nKhayyam asserts: \nWhat remains from among the most important and difficult\nproblems\n[to solve] is the difference among the order of\nexistents…. Perhaps I, and my teacher, the master of all\nwho have proceeded before him, Avicenna, have thoughtfully reflected\nupon this problem and to the extent that it is satisfactory to our\nintellects, we have understood it.6 \nIn his treatise “On the Knowledge of the Universal Principles of\nExistence,” (Risālah dar ‘ilm kulliyāt-i\nwujūd, in Malik, 381) as well as a number of his other\nworks, Khayyam adopts the Neoplatonic scheme of emanation and\noffers an analysis of a number of traditional philosophical themes\nwithin this context. \n\nKhayyam has been accused of believing in the\ntransmigration of the soul and even corporeal resurrection in this\nworld. This is partially due to some of the inauthentic\nRubā‘iyyāt that have been attributed to him.        Khayyam’s\nphilosophical treatises indicate that he did believe in life after\ndeath, and in this regard his views were in line with traditional\nIslamic eschatological doctrine. Khayyam the poet, however, plays\nwith the notion of life after death in a variety of ways. First, he\ncasts doubt on the very existence of a life beyond our earthly\nexistence; second, he says that based on our very experience in this\nworld, all things seem to perish and not return. Some of his poems play\nwith the idea of the transmigration of the soul (taṇāsukh).\nThis is more symbolic than actual; in numerous poems he tells us that\nwe turn to dust and it is from our dust that other living beings rise.\nKhayyam’s comments regarding the possibility of life\nafter death may well have been an indirect criticism of the orthodox\njurists who spoke of the intricacies of heaven and hell with\ncertainty.7 \n\nThe problem of theodicy, which Khayyam handles both\nphilosophically and poetically, is one of the most prevalent themes in\nhis quatrains, yet his approach differs in each medium. It is an\nirony that while in his philosophy Khayyam offers a rational\nexplanation for the existence of evil, in his\nRubā‘iyyāt he strongly condemns the presence of evil\nand finds no acceptable justification for its presence. One may argue\nthat such an inconsistency bears witness to the fact that the\nphilosophical treatises and the Rubā‘iyyāt are not\nauthored by the same person. While this remains a possibility, it is\nalso reasonable that these seemingly contradictory works might belong\nto the same person. The discrepancy speaks to the human condition that\ndespite our rationalization of the problem of evil, on a practical and\nemotional level we remain fundamentally bewildered by the unnecessary\npresence of so much pain and suffering. \n\nQāḍī Abū Naṣr, a statesman and\nscholar from Shirāz, posed the following question to Khayyam: \nIt is therefore necessary that the Necessary Being be the cause\nof the emergence of evil, opposition and corruption in the world.\nThis is not worthy of Divine status. So how can we resolve\nthis problem and the conflict so evil will not be attributed to the\nNecessary Being? (Ḍarurat al-taḍād\nfi'l-‘ālam wa'l-jabr\nwa'l-baqā’, Malik) \n In his work “On the\nNecessity of Contradiction in the World and Determinism and\nSubsistence,” Khayyam offers three arguments to exonerate God from\nbeing the origin of evil by identifying evil with non-existence or\nabsence. God, Khayyam argues, has created the essences of\nall the contingent beings, which are good in and of themselves since\nany being, ontologically speaking, is better than \n non-being.8\nEvil therefore represents an absence, a non-being for\nwhich God cannot be blamed. \n\nBoth his Western and Eastern expositors consider Khayyam\nto be a determinist (jabrī). However, his views on the\nsubject matter are far more complex, as he demonstrates in On Being and\nNecessity, a work devoted almost entirely to the issue. It is\nnoteworthy that instead of the traditional use of the term\n“determinism” (jabr), Khayyam uses the concept of\nnecessity (taklīf) to denote determinism or predestination.\nIn his work “On the Necessity of Contradiction in the World, and\nDeterminism and Subsistence,” Khayyam indicates that determinism is\nclose to his philosophical perspective provided it is not taken to its\nextreme:  \nAs to the question of his Highness [Qāḍī\nNasawī] concerning which of the two\ngroups (determinists or free will) are closer to truth I say\ninitially\nand in the first sight, perhaps the determinists are closer to\ntruth provided we do not enter into their nonsensical and absurd\n[claims] for\nthose are far from truth. (Ḍarūrat\nal-taḍād fi'l-‘ālam wa'l-jabr\nwa'l-baqā‘, 169 ) \n\nKhayyam identifies three types of determinism: \n\nBy “Universal-cosmic determinism” Khayyam means we\nhave been thrown into this world by accident, which creates in us a\nsense of bewilderment and existential anxiety. Khayyam\nexpresses this when he says: \nWith Earth’s first Clay They did the Last Man knead, And there of\nthe Last Harvest sow'd the Seed: And the first Morning of\nCreation wrote What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall\nread. (Rubā‘iyyāt, FitzGerald 1859, p. 41) \n\nIn the cosmic and universal sense, our presence in this world and\nour entry and exit is predetermined, a condition that Khayyam\nbemoans throughout his Rubā‘iyyāt. \n\nThe second sense of determinism is Socio-economic, which is rarely\naddressed by Muslim philosophers. Khayyam observed: God created the human species such that it is not possible for\nit to survive and reach perfection unless it is through reciprocity,\nassistance, and help. Until food, clothes, and a home that are\nthe essentials of life are not prepared, the possibility of the\nattainment of perfection does not exist. (Ḍarūrat\nal-taḍād fi'l-‘ālam wa'l-jabr\nwa'l-baqā‘, 143).  \n\n       Finally there is “ontological\ndeterminism,” which relies on a Neoplatonic scheme of emanation\nwhich Khayyam considers to be “among the most significant\nand complex of all questions,” since “the order of the\nworld is in accordance to how the wisdom of God decreed it”\n(Fi'l- kawn wa'l-taklīf, 145). He continues,\n“Necessity is a command which is issued from God Most High, so\npeople may attain those perfections that lead them to happiness”\n(Fi'l- kawn wa'l-taklīf, 143). This Greek concept of\nhappiness, restated by Fārābī as “For every being\nis made to achieve the ultimate perfection it is susceptible of\nachieving according to its specific place in the order of being,”\n(Al-Fārābī 1973, 224 ) implies that at least our\nontological status is pre-determined. \n\nIn a complex discussion, Khayyam presents his views on the\nrelationship between the subject, predicate, and attributes using a\nmixture of original insight and Aristotelian precedent. Dividing the\nattributes into two parts, essential and accidental, he discusses\nessential and accidental attributes and their subdivisions such as\nabstract (i‘tibārī) and existential\n(wujūdī) (Risālah fi'l-wujūd,\n102). Continuing the argument in “The Necessity of\nContradiction, Determinism, and Subsistence”\n(Ḍarūrat al-taḍād fi'l-‘ālam\nwa'l-jabr wa'l-baqā‘, 164), Khayyam proposes that\nconceiving essential attributes necessitates the presence of a priori\n(badawī) concepts such as “animality which is an\nessential attribute of man.”\n \n\nKhayyam’s ontological views can be formulated in\nthe following ways:9 \n\nKhayyam in Risālah fi'l-wujūd writes that\n“existence is abstract (secondary) (i‘tibārī) by way of\nemanation.” In addition, section seventeen of this\ntreatise, entitled “Existence is an Added Concept to\nEssence” states, “The traces of existence can be found in\nall things such as accidents and there is no doubt that existence is a\nconcept added to essence, that is intelligible (Ḍarūrat\nal-taḍād fi'l-‘ālam wa'l-jabr\nwa'l-baqā‘, 111). Clearly Khayyam supports the\nprincipality of essence. By relying on reductio ad absurdum, he\nconcludes that if essence were to be secondary, it would have to exist\nprior to itself, which is impossible. Khayyam states\n“essence is primary and nothing else,” because\n“essence was non-existent and then became existent.” He\ngoes on to argue “essence does not need existence [to exist] and\n[its existence] is not in relation to an existent since [if] essence\nprior to existing was non-existing (ma‛dūm), then how can\nsomething need something else [in order to exist] prior to its\nexistence?” (Ḍarūrat al-taḍād\nfi'l-‘ālam wa'l-jabr\nwa'l-baqā‘, 125). \n\nThis may lead the reader to believe that Khayyam was the\nfirst Muslim philosopher to support the theory of the principality of\nessence, but a more careful reading reveals an interesting twist:\nnamely, that Khayyam’s understanding of how essences came to\nbe casts doubt on his belief in the principality of essence. Towards\nthe end of the Risālah fi'l-wujūd he uses the\nNeoplatonic scheme of emanation to explain the origin of essences and\nstates: “Therefore, it became clear that all\nsubstances\n (dhāt)10\nand essences (māhiyyah) emanate\nfrom the essence of the First Exalted Origin, in an orderly fashion,\nmay glory be upon Him.” The traditional Neoplatonic scheme,\nat least in Ibn Sīnā’s version, clearly considers this\nsuccession to be existential, whereby levels of existence emanate from\nthe One. Khayyam replaces essence with existence here and\nthe question is whether he equates them and thereby deviates from his\nteacher Ibn Sīnā. Khayyam furthermore explains that\n“they [essences] are all good in themselves and there is no evil\nin them in any form or fashion” (Ḍarūrat\nal-taḍād fi'l-‘ālam wa'l-jabr\nwa'l-baqā‘, 130). This deviates from the standard\ndefinitions of an essence and is much closer to Plato’s forms\nthan the traditional notion of māhiyyah. \n\n       It appears that Khayyam equates\nexistence and essence as having emanated from God in an orderly\nfashion, but there is no explanation of how essence becomes primary and\nexistence secondary. In fact, if existence did not exist how\ncould essences come to be? They would have to come to be without\nBeing-be there to receive them, as it were. Either essence or existence\nemanated from God separately, in which case their priority and\nposterity are not essential as is the relationship between father and\nson, or their priority is accidental. The latter is not the type\nof priority that Khayyam has in mind; if essence is to be\nessentially prior to existence, they both could not have been emanated\nfrom God and one should be a byproduct of the other, i.e., an\nontological level of reality.      \n\nIn another work, The Brightening of the Intellect on the\nSubject of Universal\n Knowledge,11\nKhayyam\noffers three reasons why existence is not added to essence and\ntherefore is primary. A summary of his reasons is as follows: \n\nTo refute the primacy of essence over existence, Khayyam\noffers an argument based on the relationship between subject and\npredicate. He argues that “Existence exists and does not\nneed another existence;” (Risālah fi'l-wujūd)\nbut, cognizant of the counterargument, he also states that one may\nobject by saying that the same argument holds true with regard to\nessence. So one can say, “A man is a man through man-ness and\nman-ness does not need another man-ness to be man-ness”\n(Risālah fi'l-wujūd). \n\nAlthough the distinction between the principality of\nwujūd (aṣālat al-wujūd)\nand the principality of māhiyyah (aṣālat\nal-māhiyyah) can be found among early Muslim philosophers, the\nsubject matter became particularly significant in later Islamic\nphilosophy, especially through the School of Iṣfahān and the\nwork of its most outstanding figure, Mullā Ṣadrā.\nThis is important for our discussion since Umar Khayyam may\nsimply have presented the arguments for and against the priority and\nposterity of essence and existence without attaching much significance\nto their philosophical consequences, as was the case in later Islamic\nphilosophy. \n\nKhayyam’s philosophical works are the least studied\naspects of his thought, and were not even available in published form\nuntil a few years ago. They permit a fresh look at overall\nKhayyamian thought and prove indispensable to an understanding of\nhis Rubā‘iyyāt. In his philosophical works,\nKhayyam writes as a Muslim philosopher and treats a variety of\ntraditional philosophical problems; but in his\nRubā‘iyyāt, our Muslim philosopher morphs into an\nagnostic Epicurean. A detailed study of Khayyam’s\nphilosophical works reveals several explanations for this dichotomy,\nthe most likely of which is the conflict between pure and practical\nreasoning. Whereas such questions as theodicy, the existence of\nGod, soul and the possibility of life after death may be argued for\nphilosophically, such arguments hardly seem relevant to the human\ncondition given our daily share of suffering. \n\nIt is in light of the distinction between “is” and\n“ought,” the “ideal” and the\n“actual,” that discrepancies between Khayyam’s\nRubā‘iyyāt and his philosophical views should be\nunderstood. Khayyam’s Rubā‘iyyāt are\nthe works of a sober philosopher and not that of a hedonistic poet.\nWhereas Khayyam the philosopher-mathematician justifies\ntheism based on the existing order in the universe, Khayyam the\npoet, for whom suffering in the world remains insoluble, sees very\nlittle evidence to support theism or any type of eschatological\ndoctrine. \nHere with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough, A Flask of Wine, a\nBook of Verse—and Thou Beside me singing in the\nWilderness—And Wilderness is Paradise\nenow. (Rubā‘iyyāt, FitzGerald 1859, 30) \n\nAlthough Umar Khayyam’s Rubā‘iyyāt have\nbeen admired in the Persian speaking world for many centuries, they\nhave only been known in the West since the mid 19th century, when\nEdward FitzGerald rendered the Rubā‘iyyāt into\nEnglish. \n\nThe word Ruba‘ī\n(plural: Rubā‘iyyāt), meaning\n“quatrain,” comes from the word al-Rabi‘,\nthe number four in Arabic. It refers to a poetic form which consists\nof a four-lined stanza and two hemistiches for a total of four parts.\nAlso known as tarānah (snatch)\nor dobaītī (two-liner), its short and simple form\nprovides a type of “poetic punch line.” \n\nThe overwhelming majority of the literary works on the\nRubā‘iyyāt have been devoted to the monumental task of\ndetermining the authentic Rubā‘iyyāt from the\ninauthentic ones. In our current discussion, we shall bypass that\ncontroversy and rely on the most authoritative\nRubā‘iyyāt in order to provide a commentary on\nKhayyam’s critique of the fundamental tenets of religion.\nThe salient feature of his critique address the following: \n\nThe Rubā‘iyyāt’s overarching theme is the\ntemporality of human existence and the suffering that one endures\nduring a seemingly senseless existence. Clearly, such a view based on\nhis observation of the world around him is in sharp contrast with the\nIslamic view presented in the Quran: “I (Allah) have not created\nthe celestial bodies and the earth in vain.” (Quran, 38:27 )\nUmar Khayyam was caught between the rationalistic tradition\nof the Peripatetics deeply entrenched in the Islamic religious universe\nand his own failure to find any meaning or purpose in human existence\non a more immediate and experiential level. Khayyam the poet\ncriticizes the meaninglessness of life whereas Khayyam the\nphilosopher remains loyal to the Islamic Peripatetic tradition which\nadheres to a theocentric world view. \n\nUsing the imagery of a kuzah (“jug”) and clay throughout\nthe Rubā‘iyyāt, Khayyam alludes to the temporality\nof life and its senselessness: \nI saw the potter in the market yesterday\nPounding and pounding upon a piece of clay\n“Behold,” said the clay to the potter\nTreat me gently for once like you, now I am clay (translation by the\nauthor.) \n\nKhayyam fails to see a profound meaning in human existence; his\nexistential anxiety is compounded by the fact that we are subject to\nour daily share of suffering, a concept that runs contrary to that of\nthe all merciful and compassionate God of Islam. \n\nThe problem of suffering has an ominous presence in the\nRubā‘iyyāt, which contains both Epicurean and Stoic\nthemes. On theodicy, Khayyam remarks: \nIn what life yields in this Two-door monastery\nYour share in the pain of heart and death will tarry\nThe one who does not bear a child is happy\nAnd he not born of a mother, merry (translation by the author.) \nAnd also: \nLife is dark and maze-like, it is\nSuffering cast upon us and comfort in abyss\nPraise the Lord for all the means of evil\nAsk none other than He for malice (translation by the author.) \n\nIt is an irony that while Khayyam complains about theodicy and\nhuman suffering throughout his Rubā‘iyyāt, in his\nphilosophical works he offers a treatise almost entirely devoted to a\nphilosophical justification of the problem of evil. It is noteworthy\nthat theodicy as a theological and philosophical problem in Islam never\nreceived the attention it did in Western intellectual tradition. In\nearly Islamic history theodicy was briefly discussed by a number of\ntheologians, but the subject matter was soon dropped, partially because\nthe orthodox theologians saw it as questioning God’s wisdom.\n \n\nFor Khayyam the poet, traditional metaphysics, or what he calls\n“the tale of the seventy-two nations,” is merely a flight\nof fancy for the human condition, which he describes as a\n“sorrow laden nest.” The art of living in the\npresent, a theme dealt with in Sufi literature, is a type of wisdom\nthat must be acquired, since living for the hereafter and heavenly\nrewards is conventional wisdom more suitable for the masses. \nOn this Khayyam asserts: \nToday is thine to spend, but not to-morrow,\nCounting on morrow breedeth naught but sorrow;\nOh! Squander not this breath that heaven hath lent thee,\nNor make too sure another breath to borrow (Whinfield 2001,\n30; modified by the author.) \n\nAnd also \nWhat matters if I feast, or have to fast?\nWhat if my days in joy or grief are cast?\nFill me with Thee, O Guide! I cannot ken\nIf breath I draw returns or fails at last. (Whinfield 2001, 144) Khayyam’s emphasis on living in the\npresent, or as Sufi’s say “Sufi is the Son of time,”\nalong with his use of other Sufi metaphors such as wine, intoxication\nand love making, have been interpreted by some scholars as merely\nmystical\n allegories.12\nAlthough a mystical\ninterpretation of the Rubā‘iyyāt has been\nadvocated by some, it remains the view of a minority of scholars. \n\nThe complexity of the world according to Khayyam the\nmathematician-astronomer necessitates the existence of a creator and\nsustainer of the universe; and yet on a more immediate and existential\nlevel, he finds no reason or meaning for human existence. This leads to\nthe theme of doubt and bewilderment, since reason necessitates that\nevery design should have a designer—and yet one fails to find a\ndesigner or a purpose for the very existence of the design.  \nHumans, Khayyam tells us, are thrown into an existence they\ncannot make sense of: \nThe sphere upon which mortals come and go,\nHas no end nor beginning that we know;\nAnd none there is to tell us in plain truth:\nWhence do we come and whither do we go. (Whinfield 2001, 132) \n\nThe inconsistency between a seemingly senseless existence and a\ncomplex and orderly world leads to existential and philosophical doubt\nand bewilderment. The tension between Khayyam’s\nphilosophical writings in which he embraces the Islamic Peripatetic\nphilosophical tradition, and his Rubā‘iyyāt where he\nexpresses his profound skepticism, stems from this paradox. In his\nRubā‘iyyāt Khayyam embraces humanism and\nagnosticism, leaving the individual disoriented, anxious and\nbewildered; whereas in his philosophical writings he operates within a\ntheistic world where all things are as they should be. Lack of\ncertainty with regard to religious truth leaves the individual in an\nepistemologically suspended state where one has to live in the here and\nnow irrespective of the question of truth. \nSince neither truth nor certitude is at hand\nDo not waste your life in doubt for a fairyland\nO let us not refuse the goblet of wine\nFor, sober or drunken, in ignorance we stand (translation by the\nauthor.) \n\nThe Rubā‘iyyāt casts doubt on Islamic eschatological\nand soteriological views. Once again the tension between\nKhayyam’s poetic and philosophical modes of thought\nsurfaces; experientially there is evidence to conclude that death is\nthe end.  \nBehind the curtain none has found his way\nNone came to know the secret as we could say\nAnd each repeats the dirge his fancy taught\nWhich has no sense-but never ends the lay (Whinfield 2001,\n229) \n\nIn the Rubā‘iyyāt, Khayyam portrays the\nuniverse as a beautiful ode which reads\n“from dust we come and to dust we return,” and\n“every brick is made from the skull of a man.” While\nKhayyam does not explicitly deny the existence of life after\ndeath, perhaps for political reasons and fear of being labeled a\nheretic, there are subtle references throughout his\nRubā‘iyyāt that the hereafter should be taken\nwith a grain of salt. In contrast, in his philosophical writings we see\nhim argue for the incorporeality of the soul, which paves the path for\nthe existence of life after death. The irreconcilable conflict\nbetween Khayyam’s observation that death is the inevitable\nend for all beings, and his philosophical reflections in favor of the\npossibility of the existence of life after death, remains an insoluble\nriddle. \n\nKhayyam is known as a determinist in both the East and the\nWest, and deterministic themes can be seen in much of the\nRubā‘iyyāt. But if we read his\nRubā‘iyyāt together with his philosophical writings,\nthe picture that emerges may be more rightly called “soft\ndeterminism.”   One of Khayyam’s best known\nquatrains in which determinism is clearly conveyed asserts: \nThe Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, Moves on: nor all\nyour Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,\nNor all your Tears wash out a Word of it\n(Rubā‘iyyāt, FitzGerald 1859, p. 20) \n\nIn his philosophical treatise “On the Necessity of Contradiction\nin the World, and Determinism and Subsistence” Khayyam adheres\nto three types of determinism. On a universal or cosmic level, our\nbirth is determined in the sense that we had no choice in this matter.\nOntologically speaking, our essence and our place on the overall\nhierarchy of beings appears also to be predetermined. However, the\nthird category of determinism, socio-political determinism, is manmade\nand thus changeable. \nAt first they brought me perplexed in this way\nAmazement still enhances day by day\nWe all alike are tasked to go but Oh!\nWhy are we brought and sent? This none can say. (Rubā‘iyyāt, Tirtha 1941,\n18) \n\nThus a reading of the Rubā‘iyyāt in conjunction with\nKhayyam’s philosophical reflections brings forward a more\nsophisticated view of free will and determinism indicating that\nKhayyam believed in free will within a form of cosmic determinism.\n \nKhayyam uses the concept of “wine and intoxication”\nthroughout his\nRubā‘iyyāt in three distinct ways: \n\nThe pedestrian use of wine in the Rubā‘iyyāt, devoid\nof any intellectual significance, emphasizes the need to forget our\ndaily suffering. The mystical allusions to wine pertain to a type of\nintoxication which stands opposed to discursive thought. The\nesoteric use of wine and drinking, which has a long history in Persian\nSufi literature, refers to the state of ecstasy in which one is\nintoxicated with Divine love. Those supporting the Sufi interpretation\nof Rubā‘iyyāt rely on this literary genre. While\nKhayyam was not a Sufi in the traditional sense of the word, he\nincludes the mystical use of wine among his allusions. \n\nKhayyam’s use of wine in the profound sense in his\nRubā‘iyyāt is a type of Sophia that provides a sage\nwith philosophical wisdom, allowing one to come to terms with the\ntemporality of life and to live in the here and now. \nThose imprisoned by the intellect’s need to decipher\nHumbled; knowing being from non-being, they proffer\nSeek ignorance and drink the juice of the grape\nThose fools acting as wise, scoffer. (modified by the author) \n\nKhirad (wisdom) is the type of wisdom that brings about a\nrapprochement between the poetic and discursive modes of thought, one\nthat sees the fundamental irony in what appears to be a senseless human\nexistence within an orderly and complex physical universe. For\nKhayyam the mathematician-astronomer, the universe cannot be the\nresult of a random chance; on the other hand, Khayyam the poet\nfails to find any purpose for human existence in this orderly\nuniverse. \nAs Spring and Fall make their appointed turn,\nThe leaves of life one aft another turn;\nDrink wine and brood not—as the Sage has said:\n“Life’s cares are poison, wine the cure in turn.”\n(Sa‘idī 1994, 58 ) \n\nIn several respects Khayyam’s mathematical writings are\nsimilar to his texts in other genres: they are relatively few in\nnumber, but deal with well-chosen topics and carry deep implications.\nSome of his mathematics relates in passing to philosophical matters (in\nparticular, reasoning from postulates and definitions), but his most\nsignificant work deals with issues internal to mathematics and in\nparticular the boundary between geometry and algebra. Khayyam seems to have been attracted to cubic\nequations originally through his consideration of the following\ngeometric problem: in a quadrant of a circle, drop a perpendicular from\nsome point on the circumference to one of the radii so that the ratio\nof the perpendicular to the radius is equal to the ratio of the two\nparts of the radius on which the perpendicular falls. In a short,\nuntitled treatise, Khayyam leads us from one case of this problem\nto the equation \n x3 + 200x = 20x2 + 2000.13\nAn\napproximation to the solution of this equation is not difficult to\nfind, but Khayyam also generates a direct geometric solution: he\nuses the numbers in the equation to determine intersecting curves of\ntwo conic sections (a circle and a hyperbola), and demonstrates that\nthe solution x is equal to the length of a particular line segment in\nthe diagram. Solving algebraic problems using geometric tools was not new; in\nthe case of quadratic equations methods like this date back at least\nas far as the Greeks and probably to the Babylonians.  Predecessors\nsuch as al-Khwārizmī (early 9th century) and\nThābit ibn Qurra (836–901 CE) already had solved quadratic\nequations using the straightedge and compass geometry of\nEuclid’s Elements.  Since negative numbers had not yet been\nconceived, Muslim mathematicians needed to solve several different\ntypes of quadratic equations: for\ninstance, x2 = mx + n\nwas fundamentally different from\nx2 + mx = n. For\ncubics, there are fourteen distinction types of equation to be\nsolved. In his “Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of\nAlgebra”14\nKhayyam notes that four of these fourteen have been solved and says\nthat al-Khāzin (d. 961/971) was one of the authors, having solved\na problem from Archimedes' treatise On the Sphere and\nCylinder that al-Māhānī (fl.  ca. 860) had\npreviously converted into a cubic. \n\nIn the Algebra, Khayyam sets out to deal systematically with\nall fourteen types of cubic equations. He solves each one in sequence\nagain through the use of intersecting conic sections. In an algebra\nwhere powers of x corresponded to geometrical dimensions, the solution\nof cubic equations was the apex of the discipline. Nevertheless, even here Khayyam was able to advance algebra by considering its unknowns as dimension-free abstractions of continuous quantities.15 Khayyam also\nconsiders circumstances under which certain cubic equations have more\nthan one solution. Although he does not handle this topic perfectly,\nhis effort nevertheless stood out from previous efforts. \n\nA geometric solution to a cubic equation may seem peculiar to modern\neyes, but the study of cubic equations (and indeed much of medieval\nalgebra) was motivated by geometric problems. Khayyam was\nnevertheless explicitly aware that the arithmetic problem of the cubic\nremained to be solved. He never produced such a solution; nor did\nanyone else until Gerolamo Cardano in the mid-16th century. The process of reasoning from postulates and\ndefinitions has been basic to mathematics at least since the time of\nEuclid. Islamic geometers were well versed in this art, but also spent\nsome effort examining the logical foundations of the method. They were\nunafraid to revise and improve upon Euclid’s starting points, and\nthey rebuilt the Elements from the ground up in several ways.\nKhayyam’s Explanation of the Difficulties in the Postulates\nof\n Euclid16\ndeals with the two most important\nissues in this context, the parallel postulate and the definition of\nequality of ratios. \n\nEuclid’s fifth “parallel” postulate states that if\na line falls on two given lines such that the two interior angles add\nup to less than two right angles, then the given lines must meet on\nthat side. This statement is equivalent to several more easily\nunderstood assertions, such as: there is exactly one parallel to a\ngiven line that passes through a given point; or, the angles of a\ntriangle add up to two right angles. It has been known since the 19th\ncentury that there are non-Euclidean geometries that violate these\nproperties; indeed, it is not yet known whether the space in which we\nlive satisfies them. The parallel postulate, however, was not subject\nto doubt at Khayyam’s time, so it is more appropriate to\nthink of Islamic efforts in this area as part of the tradition of\nimproving upon Euclid rather than as the origin of non-Euclidean\ngeometry. Khayyam’s reconstruction of Euclid is one of the\nbetter ones: he does not try to prove the parallel postulate. Rather,\nhe replaces it with two statements, which he attributes to Aristotle,\nthat are both simpler and more self-evident: two lines that converge\nmust intersect, and two lines that converge can never diverge in the\ndirection of convergence. Khayyam then replaces Euclid’s\n29th proposition, the first in which the parallel postulate is used,\nwith a new sequence of eight propositions. Khayyam’s\ninsertion amounts to determining that the so-called Saccheri\nquadrilateral (one with two altitudes equal in length, both emerging at\nright angles from a base) is in fact a rectangle. Khayyam believed\nhis approach to be an improvement on that of his predecessor Ibn\nal-Haytham because his method does not rely on the concept of motion,\nwhich should be excluded from geometry. Apparently Naṣīr\nal-Dīn al-Ṭūsī agreed, since he followed\nKhayyam’s path a century or two later. \n\nBook II of Explanation of the Difficulties in the Postulates of\nEuclid takes up the question of the proper definition of\nratio. This is an obscure topic to the modern reader, but it was\nfundamental to Greek and medieval mathematics. If the quantities\njoined in a ratio are whole numbers, then the definition of their\nratio poses no difficulty. If the quantities are geometric magnitudes,\nthe situation is more complex because the two line segments might be\nincommensurable (in modern terms, their ratio corresponds to an\nirrational number). Euclid, following Eudoxus, asserts\nthat A/B = C/D when, for\nany magnitudes x and y, the magnitudes xA\nand xC are both (i) greater than, (ii) equal to, or (iii)\nless than, the magnitudes yB and yD\nrespectively. There is little wonder that Khayyam and others were\nunhappy with this definition, for while it is clearly true, it does\nnot get at the heart of what it means for ratios to be equal. \n\nAn alternate approach, which may have existed in ancient Greece but is\nonly known for certain to have existed from the 9th century\nCE, is the “anthyphairetic” definition (Hogendijk 2002\n). The Euclidean algorithm is an iterative process that is used to\nfind the greatest common divisor of a pair of numbers. It may be\napplied equally well to find the greatest common measure of two\ngeometric magnitudes, but the algorithm will never terminate if the\nratio between the two magnitudes is irrational. A sequence of\ndivisions within the algorithm results in a “continued\nfraction” that corresponds to the ratio between the original two\nquantities. Khayyam, following several earlier Islamic mathematicians,\ndefines the equality of A/B and\nC/D according to whether their continued fractions are equal. \n\nOne may wonder why the proponents of the anthyphairetic definition\nfelt that it was more natural than Euclid’s approach. There is no\ndoubt, however, that it was preferred; Khayyam even refers to the\nanthyphairetic definition as the “true” nature of\nproportionality. Part of the explanation might be simply that the\nEuclidean algorithm applied to geometric quantities was much more\nfamiliar to medieval mathematicians than to us. It has also been\nsuggested that Khayyam’s preference is due to the fact that\nthe anthyphairetic definition allows a ratio to be considered on its\nown, rather than always in equality to some other ratio.\nKhayyam’s achievement in this topic was not to invent a new\ndefinition, but rather to demonstrate that each of the existing\ndefinitions logically implies the other. Thus Islamic mathematicians\ncould continue to use ratio theorems from the Elements without having\nto prove them again according to the anthyphairetic definition. \n\nBook III continues the discussion of ratios; Khayyam sets\nhimself the task of demonstrating the seemingly innocuous proposition\nA/C = (A/B) (B/C),\na fact which is used in the Elements but never proved. During this\nprocess he sets an arbitrary fixed magnitude to serve as a unit, to\nwhich he relates all other magnitudes of the same kind. This allows\nKhayyam to incorporate both numbers and geometric magnitudes\nwithin the same system. Thus Khayyam thinks of irrational\nmagnitudes as numbers themselves, which effectively defines the set of\n“real numbers” that we take for granted today. This step\nwas one of the most significant changes of conception to occur between\nancient Greek and modern mathematics. \n\nWe know that Khayyam wrote a treatise, now lost, called\nProblems of Arithmetic involving the determination of n-th roots\n(Youschkevitch and Rosenfeld 1973 ). In his Algebra Khayyam\nwrites that methods for calculating square and cube roots come from\nIndia, and that he has extended them to the determination of roots of\nany order. Even more interestingly, he says that he has demonstrated\nthe validity of his methods using proofs that “are purely\narithmetic, founded on the arithmetic of the Elements.” If both\nof these statements are true, then it is hard to avoid the conclusion\nthat Khayyam had within his power the binomial theorem \n(a + b)n = an + nan−1b + … + bn, which would be the earliest appearance of\nthis important result in medieval Islam. \n\nKhayyam moved to Isfahan in 1074 to help establish a new\nobservatory under the patronage of Malikshah, the Seljuk sultan, and\nhis vizier, Nizam al-Mulk. There is little doubt that\nKhayyam played a major role in the creation of the Malikī\ncalendar, the observatory’s most significant project. In addition\nto the calendar, the Isfahan observatory produced the Zīj\nMalikshah (of which only a fragment of its star catalogue survives); it\nseems to have been one of the more important astronomical\nhandbooks. \n\nSeveral treatises on other scientific topics are also attributed to\nKhayyam: a work on music theory that uses ratios to deal with\nmusical intervals, another on weights and balances, and another on a\nmathematical problem in metallurgy. All of his texts seem to have been\ntaken seriously. \n\nThe earliest extant translation of\nthe Rubā‘iyyāt was produced by Thomas Hyde in\nthe 1760s when his translation of a single quatrain appeared in\nthe Veterum Persarum et Parthorum et Medorum Religionis. It\nwas not until the 19th century, however, that the Western\nworld and literary circles discovered Umar Khayyam in all his\nrichness. \n\nThe voyage of the Rubā‘iyyāt to the West\nbegan when Sir Gore Ouseley, the British ambassador to Iran, presented\nhis collection to the Bodleian Library at Oxford University upon his\nreturn to England. In the 1840s Professor Edward Byles Cowell of\nOxford University discovered a copy of the Ruba‘iyyat\nof Khayyam and translated several of\nthe Rubā‘iyyāt. Amazed by their profundity,\nhe shared them with Edward FitzGerald, who took an immediate interest\nand published the first edition of his own translation in 1859. Four\nversions of FitzGerald’s\nRubā‘iyyāt were published over his lifetime as new\nquatrains were discovered. Realizing the free nature of his work in his\nfirst translation, FitzGerald chose the word rendered to appear on the\ntitle page in later editions instead of\n“translation” (Lange 1968).  \n\nWhile the connection between the Pre-Raphaelites and Umar\nKhayyam should not be exaggerated, the relationship that Algernon\nCharles Swinburne, George Meredith, and Dante G. Rossetti shared with\nEdward FitzGerald and their mutual admiration of Khayyam cannot be\nignored. The salient themes of the Rubā‘iyyāt became\npopular among the Pre-Raphaelites and their circle (Lange 1968).\nKhayyam’s popularity led to the formation of the “Omar\nKhayyām Club of London” (Conway 1893, 305) in 1892, which\nattracted a number of literary figures and intellectuals. The success\nof the Club soon led to the simultaneous formation of the Omar\nKhayyām Clubs of Germany and America. \n\nIn America, Umar Khayyam was well received in the New England area\nwhere his poetry was propagated by the official members of the Omar\nKhayyām Club of America. The academic community discovered\nKhayyam’s mathematical writings and poetry in the 1880s, when his\nscholarly articles and translations of his works were published. Some,\nsuch as William Edward Story, praised Umar as a mathematician and\ncompared his views with those of Johannes Kepler, Gottfried Wilhelm\nLeibniz, and Isaac Newton, while others drew their inspiration from\nhis literary tradition and called themselves “Umarians.”\nThis new literary movement soon attracted such figures as Mark Twain,\nwho composed forty-five burlesque versions of FitzGerald’s quatrains\nand integrated them with two of FitzGerald’s stanzas\nentitled AGE-A Ruba‘iyat (Twain, 1983, 14). The\nmovement also drew the attention of T.S. Eliot’s grandfather William\nGreenleaf Eliot (1811–1887), two of T.S. Eliot’s cousins, and\nT.S. Eliot himself. Umar Khayyam’s Rubā‘iyyāt\nseems to have elicited two distinct responses among many of his\nfollowers in general and the Eliot family in particular: admiration\nfor a rational theology on the one hand, and concern with the rise of\nskepticism and moral decay in America on the other. \n\nAmong other figures influenced by\nthe Rubā‘iyyāt of Umar Khayyam were certain\nmembers of the New England School of Transcendentalism, including\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David\nThoreau (Aminrazavi 2013; for a complete discussion on Umar Khayyam in\nthe West see Aminrazavi 2007, 204–278). \n\nIn the foregoing discussion, we have seen that Umar Khayyam\nwas a philosopher-sage (ḥakīm) and a spiritual-pragmatist\nwhose Rubā‘iyyāt should be seen as a philosophical\ncommentary on the human condition. The salient features of Umar\nKhayyam’s pioneering work in various branches of mathematics\nwere also discussed. Khayyam’s mathematical genius not\nonly produced the most accurate calendar to date, but the issues he\ntreated remained pertinent up until the modern period.\n \n\nFor Khayyam, there are two discourses, each of which pertains\nto one dimension of human existence: philosophical and poetic.\nPhilosophically, Khayyam was the last Peripatetic in the Persian\nspeaking world before philosophical thinking eclipsed the Eastern part\nof the Islamic world for several centuries. Khayyam defended\nrationalism against the rise of orthodoxy and made an attempt to revive\nthe spirit of rationalism which was so prevalent in the first four\ncenturies in Islam. Poetically, Khayyam represents a voice of\nprotest against what he regards to be a fundamentally unjust world.\nMany people found in him a voice they needed to hear, and\ncenturies after he had died his works became a venue for those who were\nexperiencing the same trials and tribulations as Khayyam had.\n","contact.mail":"maminraz@umw.edu","contact.domain":"umw.edu"},{"date.published":"2011-09-06","date.changed":"2017-02-10","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/umar-khayyam/","author1":"Mehdi Aminrazavi","author2":"Glen Van Brummelen","author1.info":"http://www.umw.edu/directory/employee/mehdi-aminrazavi/","entry":"umar-khayyam","body.text":"\n\n\n\nOf knowledge naught remained I did not know,\nOf secrets, scarcely any, high or low;\nAll day and night for three score and twelve years,\nI pondered, just to learn that naught I know.(Rubā‘iyyāt, Sa‘idī\n1991, p. 125)\n\n\n\n\n\nUmar Khayyam was a polymath, scientist, philosopher, and poet of\nthe 11th century CE. Whereas his mathematical works and\npoetry have been the subject of much discussion, his recently edited\nand published philosophical works have remained a largely neglected\narea of study. In what follows, we shall review and comment on the\nsalient features of Khayyam’s poetry and philosophy, their\nrelationship with one another, and Khayyam’s pioneering views on\nmathematics.\n\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Umar Khayyam’s significance in the annals\nof Islamic intellectual tradition is due to, his\nRubā‘iyyāt (quatrains) and his scientific works,\nespecially those in the field of mathematics. The latter have always\nbeen overshadowed by his poetry. In recent years, critical\neditions of the philosophical works of Khayyam have been published\nwhich not only provide us with an insight into his philosophical\nthought but also provide a context for a more philosophical\ninterpretation of the Rubā‘iyyāt.\n\n\n\nIn his Rubā‘iyyāt, Khayyam challenged\nreligious doctrines, alluded to the hypocrisy of the clergy, cast\ndoubt on almost every facet of religious belief, and appears to have\nadvocated a type of humanism. It is no wonder that some referred to\nhim as the “Eastern Voltaire” (Dole 1901, 81). This\nWestern image, solidified by the Victorian sense of the exotic,\nromantic, and often erotic notions attached to the East, was echoed\nthrough the rendition of the Rubā‘iyyāt by\nEdward FitzGerald in the 19th century.\n\nAbu'l Fatḥ Umar ibn Ibrāhīm\nKhayyām, commonly known as Umar Khayyām, is almost certainly\nthe best known Iranian poet-scientist in the West. He was born in the\ndistrict of Shādyakh of Nayshābūr (originally\n“Nayshāpūr”) in the province of\nKhorāsān sometime around 439 AH/1048\n CE,1\nand died there between 515 and 520 AH/1124 and 1129\n CE.2\nConsidering the word “Khayyām,” means\n“tent maker,” it is likely that his father\nIbrāhīm or forefathers were tent makers. Khayyām is said\nto have been quiet, reserved, and humble. His reluctance to accept\nstudents drew criticism from opponents, who claimed that he was\nimpatient, bad tempered, and uninterested in sharing his knowledge.\nGiven the radical nature of his views in the\nRubā‘iyyāt, he may merely have wished to remain\nintellectually inconspicuous. \nThe secrets which my book of love has bred, Cannot be told for\nfear of loss of head; Since none is fit to learn, or cares to\nknow, ‘Tis better all my thoughts remain\nunsaid. (Rubā‘iyyāt, Tirtha 1941 p. 266.) Khayyam’s reference to Ibn Sīnā\nas “his teacher” has led some to speculate that he actually\nstudied with Ibn Sīnā. Although this is incorrect, several\ntraditional biographers indicate that Umar Khayyam may have\nstudied with Bahmanyār, an outstanding student of Ibn\nSīnā.3 \n\n       Following a number of journeys to Herat,\nRay, and Iṣfahān (the latter being the capital of the\nSeljuqs) in search of libraries and in pursuit of astronomical\ncalculations, Khayyam’s declining health caused him to\nreturn to Nayshābūr, where he died in the district of\nShādyākh.    \n\nKhayyam wrote little, but his works—some fourteen\ntreatises identified to date—were remarkable. They can be\ncategorized primarily in three genres: mathematics, philosophy, and\npoetry. His philosophical works which have been edited and published\nrecently are: \n\nExcept the first work mentioned above which is a free translation\nand commentary on a discourse by Ibn Sīnā, the other six\nphilosophical treatises represent Khayyam’s own independent\nphilosophical views. It is noteworthy that\nKhayyam’s philosophical treatises were written in the\nPeripatetic tradition at a time when philosophy in general and\nrationalism in particular was under attack by orthodox Muslim\njurists—so much that Khayyam had to defend himself against\nthe charge of “being a philosopher.” \n “A philosopher I am,” my enemies falsely say,\n But God knows I am not what they say;\n While in this sorrow-laden nook, I reside\n   Need to know who I am, and why Here stay. (translation\nby the author.) \n\nIn “On Being and Necessity”, Khayyam defines\n“philosophy” along the Peripatetic line: “The\nessential and real issues that are discussed in philosophy are three,\n[first], ‘is it?’…second, ‘what is\nit?’…third, ‘why is it?’” (Mālik\n(ed.), 335). While these are standard Aristotelian questions,\nfor Khayyam they have a wider range of philosophical implications,\nespecially with regard to the following topics:  \n\nIn accordance with Peripatetic tradition, Umar Khayyam refers\nto God as the “Necessary Being” and offers\nseveral\n cosmological,5\nteleological, and ontological\n(Risālah fi'l-wujūd, 112) arguments for\nHis existence. Khayyam discusses issues such as necessity,\ncausality, and the impossibility of a chain of causes and effects\ncontinuing ad infinitum. Among other topics pertaining to God which\nKhayyam discusses are God’s knowledge of universals and\nparticulars and the complex nature of Divine essence. \n\nFor Khayyam, the most complex philosophical problem is to\naccount for the gradation of beings and the manner in which they are\nranked in terms of their nobility.   In “On Being and Necessity”,\nKhayyam asserts: \nWhat remains from among the most important and difficult\nproblems\n[to solve] is the difference among the order of\nexistents…. Perhaps I, and my teacher, the master of all\nwho have proceeded before him, Avicenna, have thoughtfully reflected\nupon this problem and to the extent that it is satisfactory to our\nintellects, we have understood it.6 \nIn his treatise “On the Knowledge of the Universal Principles of\nExistence,” (Risālah dar ‘ilm kulliyāt-i\nwujūd, in Malik, 381) as well as a number of his other\nworks, Khayyam adopts the Neoplatonic scheme of emanation and\noffers an analysis of a number of traditional philosophical themes\nwithin this context. \n\nKhayyam has been accused of believing in the\ntransmigration of the soul and even corporeal resurrection in this\nworld. This is partially due to some of the inauthentic\nRubā‘iyyāt that have been attributed to him.        Khayyam’s\nphilosophical treatises indicate that he did believe in life after\ndeath, and in this regard his views were in line with traditional\nIslamic eschatological doctrine. Khayyam the poet, however, plays\nwith the notion of life after death in a variety of ways. First, he\ncasts doubt on the very existence of a life beyond our earthly\nexistence; second, he says that based on our very experience in this\nworld, all things seem to perish and not return. Some of his poems play\nwith the idea of the transmigration of the soul (taṇāsukh).\nThis is more symbolic than actual; in numerous poems he tells us that\nwe turn to dust and it is from our dust that other living beings rise.\nKhayyam’s comments regarding the possibility of life\nafter death may well have been an indirect criticism of the orthodox\njurists who spoke of the intricacies of heaven and hell with\ncertainty.7 \n\nThe problem of theodicy, which Khayyam handles both\nphilosophically and poetically, is one of the most prevalent themes in\nhis quatrains, yet his approach differs in each medium. It is an\nirony that while in his philosophy Khayyam offers a rational\nexplanation for the existence of evil, in his\nRubā‘iyyāt he strongly condemns the presence of evil\nand finds no acceptable justification for its presence. One may argue\nthat such an inconsistency bears witness to the fact that the\nphilosophical treatises and the Rubā‘iyyāt are not\nauthored by the same person. While this remains a possibility, it is\nalso reasonable that these seemingly contradictory works might belong\nto the same person. The discrepancy speaks to the human condition that\ndespite our rationalization of the problem of evil, on a practical and\nemotional level we remain fundamentally bewildered by the unnecessary\npresence of so much pain and suffering. \n\nQāḍī Abū Naṣr, a statesman and\nscholar from Shirāz, posed the following question to Khayyam: \nIt is therefore necessary that the Necessary Being be the cause\nof the emergence of evil, opposition and corruption in the world.\nThis is not worthy of Divine status. So how can we resolve\nthis problem and the conflict so evil will not be attributed to the\nNecessary Being? (Ḍarurat al-taḍād\nfi'l-‘ālam wa'l-jabr\nwa'l-baqā’, Malik) \n In his work “On the\nNecessity of Contradiction in the World and Determinism and\nSubsistence,” Khayyam offers three arguments to exonerate God from\nbeing the origin of evil by identifying evil with non-existence or\nabsence. God, Khayyam argues, has created the essences of\nall the contingent beings, which are good in and of themselves since\nany being, ontologically speaking, is better than \n non-being.8\nEvil therefore represents an absence, a non-being for\nwhich God cannot be blamed. \n\nBoth his Western and Eastern expositors consider Khayyam\nto be a determinist (jabrī). However, his views on the\nsubject matter are far more complex, as he demonstrates in On Being and\nNecessity, a work devoted almost entirely to the issue. It is\nnoteworthy that instead of the traditional use of the term\n“determinism” (jabr), Khayyam uses the concept of\nnecessity (taklīf) to denote determinism or predestination.\nIn his work “On the Necessity of Contradiction in the World, and\nDeterminism and Subsistence,” Khayyam indicates that determinism is\nclose to his philosophical perspective provided it is not taken to its\nextreme:  \nAs to the question of his Highness [Qāḍī\nNasawī] concerning which of the two\ngroups (determinists or free will) are closer to truth I say\ninitially\nand in the first sight, perhaps the determinists are closer to\ntruth provided we do not enter into their nonsensical and absurd\n[claims] for\nthose are far from truth. (Ḍarūrat\nal-taḍād fi'l-‘ālam wa'l-jabr\nwa'l-baqā‘, 169 ) \n\nKhayyam identifies three types of determinism: \n\nBy “Universal-cosmic determinism” Khayyam means we\nhave been thrown into this world by accident, which creates in us a\nsense of bewilderment and existential anxiety. Khayyam\nexpresses this when he says: \nWith Earth’s first Clay They did the Last Man knead, And there of\nthe Last Harvest sow'd the Seed: And the first Morning of\nCreation wrote What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall\nread. (Rubā‘iyyāt, FitzGerald 1859, p. 41) \n\nIn the cosmic and universal sense, our presence in this world and\nour entry and exit is predetermined, a condition that Khayyam\nbemoans throughout his Rubā‘iyyāt. \n\nThe second sense of determinism is Socio-economic, which is rarely\naddressed by Muslim philosophers. Khayyam observed: God created the human species such that it is not possible for\nit to survive and reach perfection unless it is through reciprocity,\nassistance, and help. Until food, clothes, and a home that are\nthe essentials of life are not prepared, the possibility of the\nattainment of perfection does not exist. (Ḍarūrat\nal-taḍād fi'l-‘ālam wa'l-jabr\nwa'l-baqā‘, 143).  \n\n       Finally there is “ontological\ndeterminism,” which relies on a Neoplatonic scheme of emanation\nwhich Khayyam considers to be “among the most significant\nand complex of all questions,” since “the order of the\nworld is in accordance to how the wisdom of God decreed it”\n(Fi'l- kawn wa'l-taklīf, 145). He continues,\n“Necessity is a command which is issued from God Most High, so\npeople may attain those perfections that lead them to happiness”\n(Fi'l- kawn wa'l-taklīf, 143). This Greek concept of\nhappiness, restated by Fārābī as “For every being\nis made to achieve the ultimate perfection it is susceptible of\nachieving according to its specific place in the order of being,”\n(Al-Fārābī 1973, 224 ) implies that at least our\nontological status is pre-determined. \n\nIn a complex discussion, Khayyam presents his views on the\nrelationship between the subject, predicate, and attributes using a\nmixture of original insight and Aristotelian precedent. Dividing the\nattributes into two parts, essential and accidental, he discusses\nessential and accidental attributes and their subdivisions such as\nabstract (i‘tibārī) and existential\n(wujūdī) (Risālah fi'l-wujūd,\n102). Continuing the argument in “The Necessity of\nContradiction, Determinism, and Subsistence”\n(Ḍarūrat al-taḍād fi'l-‘ālam\nwa'l-jabr wa'l-baqā‘, 164), Khayyam proposes that\nconceiving essential attributes necessitates the presence of a priori\n(badawī) concepts such as “animality which is an\nessential attribute of man.”\n \n\nKhayyam’s ontological views can be formulated in\nthe following ways:9 \n\nKhayyam in Risālah fi'l-wujūd writes that\n“existence is abstract (secondary) (i‘tibārī) by way of\nemanation.” In addition, section seventeen of this\ntreatise, entitled “Existence is an Added Concept to\nEssence” states, “The traces of existence can be found in\nall things such as accidents and there is no doubt that existence is a\nconcept added to essence, that is intelligible (Ḍarūrat\nal-taḍād fi'l-‘ālam wa'l-jabr\nwa'l-baqā‘, 111). Clearly Khayyam supports the\nprincipality of essence. By relying on reductio ad absurdum, he\nconcludes that if essence were to be secondary, it would have to exist\nprior to itself, which is impossible. Khayyam states\n“essence is primary and nothing else,” because\n“essence was non-existent and then became existent.” He\ngoes on to argue “essence does not need existence [to exist] and\n[its existence] is not in relation to an existent since [if] essence\nprior to existing was non-existing (ma‛dūm), then how can\nsomething need something else [in order to exist] prior to its\nexistence?” (Ḍarūrat al-taḍād\nfi'l-‘ālam wa'l-jabr\nwa'l-baqā‘, 125). \n\nThis may lead the reader to believe that Khayyam was the\nfirst Muslim philosopher to support the theory of the principality of\nessence, but a more careful reading reveals an interesting twist:\nnamely, that Khayyam’s understanding of how essences came to\nbe casts doubt on his belief in the principality of essence. Towards\nthe end of the Risālah fi'l-wujūd he uses the\nNeoplatonic scheme of emanation to explain the origin of essences and\nstates: “Therefore, it became clear that all\nsubstances\n (dhāt)10\nand essences (māhiyyah) emanate\nfrom the essence of the First Exalted Origin, in an orderly fashion,\nmay glory be upon Him.” The traditional Neoplatonic scheme,\nat least in Ibn Sīnā’s version, clearly considers this\nsuccession to be existential, whereby levels of existence emanate from\nthe One. Khayyam replaces essence with existence here and\nthe question is whether he equates them and thereby deviates from his\nteacher Ibn Sīnā. Khayyam furthermore explains that\n“they [essences] are all good in themselves and there is no evil\nin them in any form or fashion” (Ḍarūrat\nal-taḍād fi'l-‘ālam wa'l-jabr\nwa'l-baqā‘, 130). This deviates from the standard\ndefinitions of an essence and is much closer to Plato’s forms\nthan the traditional notion of māhiyyah. \n\n       It appears that Khayyam equates\nexistence and essence as having emanated from God in an orderly\nfashion, but there is no explanation of how essence becomes primary and\nexistence secondary. In fact, if existence did not exist how\ncould essences come to be? They would have to come to be without\nBeing-be there to receive them, as it were. Either essence or existence\nemanated from God separately, in which case their priority and\nposterity are not essential as is the relationship between father and\nson, or their priority is accidental. The latter is not the type\nof priority that Khayyam has in mind; if essence is to be\nessentially prior to existence, they both could not have been emanated\nfrom God and one should be a byproduct of the other, i.e., an\nontological level of reality.      \n\nIn another work, The Brightening of the Intellect on the\nSubject of Universal\n Knowledge,11\nKhayyam\noffers three reasons why existence is not added to essence and\ntherefore is primary. A summary of his reasons is as follows: \n\nTo refute the primacy of essence over existence, Khayyam\noffers an argument based on the relationship between subject and\npredicate. He argues that “Existence exists and does not\nneed another existence;” (Risālah fi'l-wujūd)\nbut, cognizant of the counterargument, he also states that one may\nobject by saying that the same argument holds true with regard to\nessence. So one can say, “A man is a man through man-ness and\nman-ness does not need another man-ness to be man-ness”\n(Risālah fi'l-wujūd). \n\nAlthough the distinction between the principality of\nwujūd (aṣālat al-wujūd)\nand the principality of māhiyyah (aṣālat\nal-māhiyyah) can be found among early Muslim philosophers, the\nsubject matter became particularly significant in later Islamic\nphilosophy, especially through the School of Iṣfahān and the\nwork of its most outstanding figure, Mullā Ṣadrā.\nThis is important for our discussion since Umar Khayyam may\nsimply have presented the arguments for and against the priority and\nposterity of essence and existence without attaching much significance\nto their philosophical consequences, as was the case in later Islamic\nphilosophy. \n\nKhayyam’s philosophical works are the least studied\naspects of his thought, and were not even available in published form\nuntil a few years ago. They permit a fresh look at overall\nKhayyamian thought and prove indispensable to an understanding of\nhis Rubā‘iyyāt. In his philosophical works,\nKhayyam writes as a Muslim philosopher and treats a variety of\ntraditional philosophical problems; but in his\nRubā‘iyyāt, our Muslim philosopher morphs into an\nagnostic Epicurean. A detailed study of Khayyam’s\nphilosophical works reveals several explanations for this dichotomy,\nthe most likely of which is the conflict between pure and practical\nreasoning. Whereas such questions as theodicy, the existence of\nGod, soul and the possibility of life after death may be argued for\nphilosophically, such arguments hardly seem relevant to the human\ncondition given our daily share of suffering. \n\nIt is in light of the distinction between “is” and\n“ought,” the “ideal” and the\n“actual,” that discrepancies between Khayyam’s\nRubā‘iyyāt and his philosophical views should be\nunderstood. Khayyam’s Rubā‘iyyāt are\nthe works of a sober philosopher and not that of a hedonistic poet.\nWhereas Khayyam the philosopher-mathematician justifies\ntheism based on the existing order in the universe, Khayyam the\npoet, for whom suffering in the world remains insoluble, sees very\nlittle evidence to support theism or any type of eschatological\ndoctrine. \nHere with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough, A Flask of Wine, a\nBook of Verse—and Thou Beside me singing in the\nWilderness—And Wilderness is Paradise\nenow. (Rubā‘iyyāt, FitzGerald 1859, 30) \n\nAlthough Umar Khayyam’s Rubā‘iyyāt have\nbeen admired in the Persian speaking world for many centuries, they\nhave only been known in the West since the mid 19th century, when\nEdward FitzGerald rendered the Rubā‘iyyāt into\nEnglish. \n\nThe word Ruba‘ī\n(plural: Rubā‘iyyāt), meaning\n“quatrain,” comes from the word al-Rabi‘,\nthe number four in Arabic. It refers to a poetic form which consists\nof a four-lined stanza and two hemistiches for a total of four parts.\nAlso known as tarānah (snatch)\nor dobaītī (two-liner), its short and simple form\nprovides a type of “poetic punch line.” \n\nThe overwhelming majority of the literary works on the\nRubā‘iyyāt have been devoted to the monumental task of\ndetermining the authentic Rubā‘iyyāt from the\ninauthentic ones. In our current discussion, we shall bypass that\ncontroversy and rely on the most authoritative\nRubā‘iyyāt in order to provide a commentary on\nKhayyam’s critique of the fundamental tenets of religion.\nThe salient feature of his critique address the following: \n\nThe Rubā‘iyyāt’s overarching theme is the\ntemporality of human existence and the suffering that one endures\nduring a seemingly senseless existence. Clearly, such a view based on\nhis observation of the world around him is in sharp contrast with the\nIslamic view presented in the Quran: “I (Allah) have not created\nthe celestial bodies and the earth in vain.” (Quran, 38:27 )\nUmar Khayyam was caught between the rationalistic tradition\nof the Peripatetics deeply entrenched in the Islamic religious universe\nand his own failure to find any meaning or purpose in human existence\non a more immediate and experiential level. Khayyam the poet\ncriticizes the meaninglessness of life whereas Khayyam the\nphilosopher remains loyal to the Islamic Peripatetic tradition which\nadheres to a theocentric world view. \n\nUsing the imagery of a kuzah (“jug”) and clay throughout\nthe Rubā‘iyyāt, Khayyam alludes to the temporality\nof life and its senselessness: \nI saw the potter in the market yesterday\nPounding and pounding upon a piece of clay\n“Behold,” said the clay to the potter\nTreat me gently for once like you, now I am clay (translation by the\nauthor.) \n\nKhayyam fails to see a profound meaning in human existence; his\nexistential anxiety is compounded by the fact that we are subject to\nour daily share of suffering, a concept that runs contrary to that of\nthe all merciful and compassionate God of Islam. \n\nThe problem of suffering has an ominous presence in the\nRubā‘iyyāt, which contains both Epicurean and Stoic\nthemes. On theodicy, Khayyam remarks: \nIn what life yields in this Two-door monastery\nYour share in the pain of heart and death will tarry\nThe one who does not bear a child is happy\nAnd he not born of a mother, merry (translation by the author.) \nAnd also: \nLife is dark and maze-like, it is\nSuffering cast upon us and comfort in abyss\nPraise the Lord for all the means of evil\nAsk none other than He for malice (translation by the author.) \n\nIt is an irony that while Khayyam complains about theodicy and\nhuman suffering throughout his Rubā‘iyyāt, in his\nphilosophical works he offers a treatise almost entirely devoted to a\nphilosophical justification of the problem of evil. It is noteworthy\nthat theodicy as a theological and philosophical problem in Islam never\nreceived the attention it did in Western intellectual tradition. In\nearly Islamic history theodicy was briefly discussed by a number of\ntheologians, but the subject matter was soon dropped, partially because\nthe orthodox theologians saw it as questioning God’s wisdom.\n \n\nFor Khayyam the poet, traditional metaphysics, or what he calls\n“the tale of the seventy-two nations,” is merely a flight\nof fancy for the human condition, which he describes as a\n“sorrow laden nest.” The art of living in the\npresent, a theme dealt with in Sufi literature, is a type of wisdom\nthat must be acquired, since living for the hereafter and heavenly\nrewards is conventional wisdom more suitable for the masses. \nOn this Khayyam asserts: \nToday is thine to spend, but not to-morrow,\nCounting on morrow breedeth naught but sorrow;\nOh! Squander not this breath that heaven hath lent thee,\nNor make too sure another breath to borrow (Whinfield 2001,\n30; modified by the author.) \n\nAnd also \nWhat matters if I feast, or have to fast?\nWhat if my days in joy or grief are cast?\nFill me with Thee, O Guide! I cannot ken\nIf breath I draw returns or fails at last. (Whinfield 2001, 144) Khayyam’s emphasis on living in the\npresent, or as Sufi’s say “Sufi is the Son of time,”\nalong with his use of other Sufi metaphors such as wine, intoxication\nand love making, have been interpreted by some scholars as merely\nmystical\n allegories.12\nAlthough a mystical\ninterpretation of the Rubā‘iyyāt has been\nadvocated by some, it remains the view of a minority of scholars. \n\nThe complexity of the world according to Khayyam the\nmathematician-astronomer necessitates the existence of a creator and\nsustainer of the universe; and yet on a more immediate and existential\nlevel, he finds no reason or meaning for human existence. This leads to\nthe theme of doubt and bewilderment, since reason necessitates that\nevery design should have a designer—and yet one fails to find a\ndesigner or a purpose for the very existence of the design.  \nHumans, Khayyam tells us, are thrown into an existence they\ncannot make sense of: \nThe sphere upon which mortals come and go,\nHas no end nor beginning that we know;\nAnd none there is to tell us in plain truth:\nWhence do we come and whither do we go. (Whinfield 2001, 132) \n\nThe inconsistency between a seemingly senseless existence and a\ncomplex and orderly world leads to existential and philosophical doubt\nand bewilderment. The tension between Khayyam’s\nphilosophical writings in which he embraces the Islamic Peripatetic\nphilosophical tradition, and his Rubā‘iyyāt where he\nexpresses his profound skepticism, stems from this paradox. In his\nRubā‘iyyāt Khayyam embraces humanism and\nagnosticism, leaving the individual disoriented, anxious and\nbewildered; whereas in his philosophical writings he operates within a\ntheistic world where all things are as they should be. Lack of\ncertainty with regard to religious truth leaves the individual in an\nepistemologically suspended state where one has to live in the here and\nnow irrespective of the question of truth. \nSince neither truth nor certitude is at hand\nDo not waste your life in doubt for a fairyland\nO let us not refuse the goblet of wine\nFor, sober or drunken, in ignorance we stand (translation by the\nauthor.) \n\nThe Rubā‘iyyāt casts doubt on Islamic eschatological\nand soteriological views. Once again the tension between\nKhayyam’s poetic and philosophical modes of thought\nsurfaces; experientially there is evidence to conclude that death is\nthe end.  \nBehind the curtain none has found his way\nNone came to know the secret as we could say\nAnd each repeats the dirge his fancy taught\nWhich has no sense-but never ends the lay (Whinfield 2001,\n229) \n\nIn the Rubā‘iyyāt, Khayyam portrays the\nuniverse as a beautiful ode which reads\n“from dust we come and to dust we return,” and\n“every brick is made from the skull of a man.” While\nKhayyam does not explicitly deny the existence of life after\ndeath, perhaps for political reasons and fear of being labeled a\nheretic, there are subtle references throughout his\nRubā‘iyyāt that the hereafter should be taken\nwith a grain of salt. In contrast, in his philosophical writings we see\nhim argue for the incorporeality of the soul, which paves the path for\nthe existence of life after death. The irreconcilable conflict\nbetween Khayyam’s observation that death is the inevitable\nend for all beings, and his philosophical reflections in favor of the\npossibility of the existence of life after death, remains an insoluble\nriddle. \n\nKhayyam is known as a determinist in both the East and the\nWest, and deterministic themes can be seen in much of the\nRubā‘iyyāt. But if we read his\nRubā‘iyyāt together with his philosophical writings,\nthe picture that emerges may be more rightly called “soft\ndeterminism.”   One of Khayyam’s best known\nquatrains in which determinism is clearly conveyed asserts: \nThe Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, Moves on: nor all\nyour Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,\nNor all your Tears wash out a Word of it\n(Rubā‘iyyāt, FitzGerald 1859, p. 20) \n\nIn his philosophical treatise “On the Necessity of Contradiction\nin the World, and Determinism and Subsistence” Khayyam adheres\nto three types of determinism. On a universal or cosmic level, our\nbirth is determined in the sense that we had no choice in this matter.\nOntologically speaking, our essence and our place on the overall\nhierarchy of beings appears also to be predetermined. However, the\nthird category of determinism, socio-political determinism, is manmade\nand thus changeable. \nAt first they brought me perplexed in this way\nAmazement still enhances day by day\nWe all alike are tasked to go but Oh!\nWhy are we brought and sent? This none can say. (Rubā‘iyyāt, Tirtha 1941,\n18) \n\nThus a reading of the Rubā‘iyyāt in conjunction with\nKhayyam’s philosophical reflections brings forward a more\nsophisticated view of free will and determinism indicating that\nKhayyam believed in free will within a form of cosmic determinism.\n \nKhayyam uses the concept of “wine and intoxication”\nthroughout his\nRubā‘iyyāt in three distinct ways: \n\nThe pedestrian use of wine in the Rubā‘iyyāt, devoid\nof any intellectual significance, emphasizes the need to forget our\ndaily suffering. The mystical allusions to wine pertain to a type of\nintoxication which stands opposed to discursive thought. The\nesoteric use of wine and drinking, which has a long history in Persian\nSufi literature, refers to the state of ecstasy in which one is\nintoxicated with Divine love. Those supporting the Sufi interpretation\nof Rubā‘iyyāt rely on this literary genre. While\nKhayyam was not a Sufi in the traditional sense of the word, he\nincludes the mystical use of wine among his allusions. \n\nKhayyam’s use of wine in the profound sense in his\nRubā‘iyyāt is a type of Sophia that provides a sage\nwith philosophical wisdom, allowing one to come to terms with the\ntemporality of life and to live in the here and now. \nThose imprisoned by the intellect’s need to decipher\nHumbled; knowing being from non-being, they proffer\nSeek ignorance and drink the juice of the grape\nThose fools acting as wise, scoffer. (modified by the author) \n\nKhirad (wisdom) is the type of wisdom that brings about a\nrapprochement between the poetic and discursive modes of thought, one\nthat sees the fundamental irony in what appears to be a senseless human\nexistence within an orderly and complex physical universe. For\nKhayyam the mathematician-astronomer, the universe cannot be the\nresult of a random chance; on the other hand, Khayyam the poet\nfails to find any purpose for human existence in this orderly\nuniverse. \nAs Spring and Fall make their appointed turn,\nThe leaves of life one aft another turn;\nDrink wine and brood not—as the Sage has said:\n“Life’s cares are poison, wine the cure in turn.”\n(Sa‘idī 1994, 58 ) \n\nIn several respects Khayyam’s mathematical writings are\nsimilar to his texts in other genres: they are relatively few in\nnumber, but deal with well-chosen topics and carry deep implications.\nSome of his mathematics relates in passing to philosophical matters (in\nparticular, reasoning from postulates and definitions), but his most\nsignificant work deals with issues internal to mathematics and in\nparticular the boundary between geometry and algebra. Khayyam seems to have been attracted to cubic\nequations originally through his consideration of the following\ngeometric problem: in a quadrant of a circle, drop a perpendicular from\nsome point on the circumference to one of the radii so that the ratio\nof the perpendicular to the radius is equal to the ratio of the two\nparts of the radius on which the perpendicular falls. In a short,\nuntitled treatise, Khayyam leads us from one case of this problem\nto the equation \n x3 + 200x = 20x2 + 2000.13\nAn\napproximation to the solution of this equation is not difficult to\nfind, but Khayyam also generates a direct geometric solution: he\nuses the numbers in the equation to determine intersecting curves of\ntwo conic sections (a circle and a hyperbola), and demonstrates that\nthe solution x is equal to the length of a particular line segment in\nthe diagram. Solving algebraic problems using geometric tools was not new; in\nthe case of quadratic equations methods like this date back at least\nas far as the Greeks and probably to the Babylonians.  Predecessors\nsuch as al-Khwārizmī (early 9th century) and\nThābit ibn Qurra (836–901 CE) already had solved quadratic\nequations using the straightedge and compass geometry of\nEuclid’s Elements.  Since negative numbers had not yet been\nconceived, Muslim mathematicians needed to solve several different\ntypes of quadratic equations: for\ninstance, x2 = mx + n\nwas fundamentally different from\nx2 + mx = n. For\ncubics, there are fourteen distinction types of equation to be\nsolved. In his “Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of\nAlgebra”14\nKhayyam notes that four of these fourteen have been solved and says\nthat al-Khāzin (d. 961/971) was one of the authors, having solved\na problem from Archimedes' treatise On the Sphere and\nCylinder that al-Māhānī (fl.  ca. 860) had\npreviously converted into a cubic. \n\nIn the Algebra, Khayyam sets out to deal systematically with\nall fourteen types of cubic equations. He solves each one in sequence\nagain through the use of intersecting conic sections. In an algebra\nwhere powers of x corresponded to geometrical dimensions, the solution\nof cubic equations was the apex of the discipline. Nevertheless, even here Khayyam was able to advance algebra by considering its unknowns as dimension-free abstractions of continuous quantities.15 Khayyam also\nconsiders circumstances under which certain cubic equations have more\nthan one solution. Although he does not handle this topic perfectly,\nhis effort nevertheless stood out from previous efforts. \n\nA geometric solution to a cubic equation may seem peculiar to modern\neyes, but the study of cubic equations (and indeed much of medieval\nalgebra) was motivated by geometric problems. Khayyam was\nnevertheless explicitly aware that the arithmetic problem of the cubic\nremained to be solved. He never produced such a solution; nor did\nanyone else until Gerolamo Cardano in the mid-16th century. The process of reasoning from postulates and\ndefinitions has been basic to mathematics at least since the time of\nEuclid. Islamic geometers were well versed in this art, but also spent\nsome effort examining the logical foundations of the method. They were\nunafraid to revise and improve upon Euclid’s starting points, and\nthey rebuilt the Elements from the ground up in several ways.\nKhayyam’s Explanation of the Difficulties in the Postulates\nof\n Euclid16\ndeals with the two most important\nissues in this context, the parallel postulate and the definition of\nequality of ratios. \n\nEuclid’s fifth “parallel” postulate states that if\na line falls on two given lines such that the two interior angles add\nup to less than two right angles, then the given lines must meet on\nthat side. This statement is equivalent to several more easily\nunderstood assertions, such as: there is exactly one parallel to a\ngiven line that passes through a given point; or, the angles of a\ntriangle add up to two right angles. It has been known since the 19th\ncentury that there are non-Euclidean geometries that violate these\nproperties; indeed, it is not yet known whether the space in which we\nlive satisfies them. The parallel postulate, however, was not subject\nto doubt at Khayyam’s time, so it is more appropriate to\nthink of Islamic efforts in this area as part of the tradition of\nimproving upon Euclid rather than as the origin of non-Euclidean\ngeometry. Khayyam’s reconstruction of Euclid is one of the\nbetter ones: he does not try to prove the parallel postulate. Rather,\nhe replaces it with two statements, which he attributes to Aristotle,\nthat are both simpler and more self-evident: two lines that converge\nmust intersect, and two lines that converge can never diverge in the\ndirection of convergence. Khayyam then replaces Euclid’s\n29th proposition, the first in which the parallel postulate is used,\nwith a new sequence of eight propositions. Khayyam’s\ninsertion amounts to determining that the so-called Saccheri\nquadrilateral (one with two altitudes equal in length, both emerging at\nright angles from a base) is in fact a rectangle. Khayyam believed\nhis approach to be an improvement on that of his predecessor Ibn\nal-Haytham because his method does not rely on the concept of motion,\nwhich should be excluded from geometry. Apparently Naṣīr\nal-Dīn al-Ṭūsī agreed, since he followed\nKhayyam’s path a century or two later. \n\nBook II of Explanation of the Difficulties in the Postulates of\nEuclid takes up the question of the proper definition of\nratio. This is an obscure topic to the modern reader, but it was\nfundamental to Greek and medieval mathematics. If the quantities\njoined in a ratio are whole numbers, then the definition of their\nratio poses no difficulty. If the quantities are geometric magnitudes,\nthe situation is more complex because the two line segments might be\nincommensurable (in modern terms, their ratio corresponds to an\nirrational number). Euclid, following Eudoxus, asserts\nthat A/B = C/D when, for\nany magnitudes x and y, the magnitudes xA\nand xC are both (i) greater than, (ii) equal to, or (iii)\nless than, the magnitudes yB and yD\nrespectively. There is little wonder that Khayyam and others were\nunhappy with this definition, for while it is clearly true, it does\nnot get at the heart of what it means for ratios to be equal. \n\nAn alternate approach, which may have existed in ancient Greece but is\nonly known for certain to have existed from the 9th century\nCE, is the “anthyphairetic” definition (Hogendijk 2002\n). The Euclidean algorithm is an iterative process that is used to\nfind the greatest common divisor of a pair of numbers. It may be\napplied equally well to find the greatest common measure of two\ngeometric magnitudes, but the algorithm will never terminate if the\nratio between the two magnitudes is irrational. A sequence of\ndivisions within the algorithm results in a “continued\nfraction” that corresponds to the ratio between the original two\nquantities. Khayyam, following several earlier Islamic mathematicians,\ndefines the equality of A/B and\nC/D according to whether their continued fractions are equal. \n\nOne may wonder why the proponents of the anthyphairetic definition\nfelt that it was more natural than Euclid’s approach. There is no\ndoubt, however, that it was preferred; Khayyam even refers to the\nanthyphairetic definition as the “true” nature of\nproportionality. Part of the explanation might be simply that the\nEuclidean algorithm applied to geometric quantities was much more\nfamiliar to medieval mathematicians than to us. It has also been\nsuggested that Khayyam’s preference is due to the fact that\nthe anthyphairetic definition allows a ratio to be considered on its\nown, rather than always in equality to some other ratio.\nKhayyam’s achievement in this topic was not to invent a new\ndefinition, but rather to demonstrate that each of the existing\ndefinitions logically implies the other. Thus Islamic mathematicians\ncould continue to use ratio theorems from the Elements without having\nto prove them again according to the anthyphairetic definition. \n\nBook III continues the discussion of ratios; Khayyam sets\nhimself the task of demonstrating the seemingly innocuous proposition\nA/C = (A/B) (B/C),\na fact which is used in the Elements but never proved. During this\nprocess he sets an arbitrary fixed magnitude to serve as a unit, to\nwhich he relates all other magnitudes of the same kind. This allows\nKhayyam to incorporate both numbers and geometric magnitudes\nwithin the same system. Thus Khayyam thinks of irrational\nmagnitudes as numbers themselves, which effectively defines the set of\n“real numbers” that we take for granted today. This step\nwas one of the most significant changes of conception to occur between\nancient Greek and modern mathematics. \n\nWe know that Khayyam wrote a treatise, now lost, called\nProblems of Arithmetic involving the determination of n-th roots\n(Youschkevitch and Rosenfeld 1973 ). In his Algebra Khayyam\nwrites that methods for calculating square and cube roots come from\nIndia, and that he has extended them to the determination of roots of\nany order. Even more interestingly, he says that he has demonstrated\nthe validity of his methods using proofs that “are purely\narithmetic, founded on the arithmetic of the Elements.” If both\nof these statements are true, then it is hard to avoid the conclusion\nthat Khayyam had within his power the binomial theorem \n(a + b)n = an + nan−1b + … + bn, which would be the earliest appearance of\nthis important result in medieval Islam. \n\nKhayyam moved to Isfahan in 1074 to help establish a new\nobservatory under the patronage of Malikshah, the Seljuk sultan, and\nhis vizier, Nizam al-Mulk. There is little doubt that\nKhayyam played a major role in the creation of the Malikī\ncalendar, the observatory’s most significant project. In addition\nto the calendar, the Isfahan observatory produced the Zīj\nMalikshah (of which only a fragment of its star catalogue survives); it\nseems to have been one of the more important astronomical\nhandbooks. \n\nSeveral treatises on other scientific topics are also attributed to\nKhayyam: a work on music theory that uses ratios to deal with\nmusical intervals, another on weights and balances, and another on a\nmathematical problem in metallurgy. All of his texts seem to have been\ntaken seriously. \n\nThe earliest extant translation of\nthe Rubā‘iyyāt was produced by Thomas Hyde in\nthe 1760s when his translation of a single quatrain appeared in\nthe Veterum Persarum et Parthorum et Medorum Religionis. It\nwas not until the 19th century, however, that the Western\nworld and literary circles discovered Umar Khayyam in all his\nrichness. \n\nThe voyage of the Rubā‘iyyāt to the West\nbegan when Sir Gore Ouseley, the British ambassador to Iran, presented\nhis collection to the Bodleian Library at Oxford University upon his\nreturn to England. In the 1840s Professor Edward Byles Cowell of\nOxford University discovered a copy of the Ruba‘iyyat\nof Khayyam and translated several of\nthe Rubā‘iyyāt. Amazed by their profundity,\nhe shared them with Edward FitzGerald, who took an immediate interest\nand published the first edition of his own translation in 1859. Four\nversions of FitzGerald’s\nRubā‘iyyāt were published over his lifetime as new\nquatrains were discovered. Realizing the free nature of his work in his\nfirst translation, FitzGerald chose the word rendered to appear on the\ntitle page in later editions instead of\n“translation” (Lange 1968).  \n\nWhile the connection between the Pre-Raphaelites and Umar\nKhayyam should not be exaggerated, the relationship that Algernon\nCharles Swinburne, George Meredith, and Dante G. Rossetti shared with\nEdward FitzGerald and their mutual admiration of Khayyam cannot be\nignored. The salient themes of the Rubā‘iyyāt became\npopular among the Pre-Raphaelites and their circle (Lange 1968).\nKhayyam’s popularity led to the formation of the “Omar\nKhayyām Club of London” (Conway 1893, 305) in 1892, which\nattracted a number of literary figures and intellectuals. The success\nof the Club soon led to the simultaneous formation of the Omar\nKhayyām Clubs of Germany and America. \n\nIn America, Umar Khayyam was well received in the New England area\nwhere his poetry was propagated by the official members of the Omar\nKhayyām Club of America. The academic community discovered\nKhayyam’s mathematical writings and poetry in the 1880s, when his\nscholarly articles and translations of his works were published. Some,\nsuch as William Edward Story, praised Umar as a mathematician and\ncompared his views with those of Johannes Kepler, Gottfried Wilhelm\nLeibniz, and Isaac Newton, while others drew their inspiration from\nhis literary tradition and called themselves “Umarians.”\nThis new literary movement soon attracted such figures as Mark Twain,\nwho composed forty-five burlesque versions of FitzGerald’s quatrains\nand integrated them with two of FitzGerald’s stanzas\nentitled AGE-A Ruba‘iyat (Twain, 1983, 14). The\nmovement also drew the attention of T.S. Eliot’s grandfather William\nGreenleaf Eliot (1811–1887), two of T.S. Eliot’s cousins, and\nT.S. Eliot himself. Umar Khayyam’s Rubā‘iyyāt\nseems to have elicited two distinct responses among many of his\nfollowers in general and the Eliot family in particular: admiration\nfor a rational theology on the one hand, and concern with the rise of\nskepticism and moral decay in America on the other. \n\nAmong other figures influenced by\nthe Rubā‘iyyāt of Umar Khayyam were certain\nmembers of the New England School of Transcendentalism, including\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David\nThoreau (Aminrazavi 2013; for a complete discussion on Umar Khayyam in\nthe West see Aminrazavi 2007, 204–278). \n\nIn the foregoing discussion, we have seen that Umar Khayyam\nwas a philosopher-sage (ḥakīm) and a spiritual-pragmatist\nwhose Rubā‘iyyāt should be seen as a philosophical\ncommentary on the human condition. The salient features of Umar\nKhayyam’s pioneering work in various branches of mathematics\nwere also discussed. Khayyam’s mathematical genius not\nonly produced the most accurate calendar to date, but the issues he\ntreated remained pertinent up until the modern period.\n \n\nFor Khayyam, there are two discourses, each of which pertains\nto one dimension of human existence: philosophical and poetic.\nPhilosophically, Khayyam was the last Peripatetic in the Persian\nspeaking world before philosophical thinking eclipsed the Eastern part\nof the Islamic world for several centuries. Khayyam defended\nrationalism against the rise of orthodoxy and made an attempt to revive\nthe spirit of rationalism which was so prevalent in the first four\ncenturies in Islam. Poetically, Khayyam represents a voice of\nprotest against what he regards to be a fundamentally unjust world.\nMany people found in him a voice they needed to hear, and\ncenturies after he had died his works became a venue for those who were\nexperiencing the same trials and tribulations as Khayyam had.\n","contact.mail":"gvb@questu.ca","contact.domain":"questu.ca"}]
