It may, initially, be identified as the one that emphasizes\nthe virtues, or moral character, in contrast to the approach that\nemphasizes duties or rules (deontology) or that emphasizes the\nconsequences of actions (consequentialism). Suppose it is obvious that\nsomeone in need should be helped. A utilitarian will point to the fact\nthat the consequences of doing so will maximize well-being, a\ndeontologist to the fact that, in doing so the agent will be acting in\naccordance with a moral rule such as “Do unto others as you\nwould be done by” and a virtue ethicist to the fact that helping\nthe person would be charitable or benevolent.\n\n\nThis is not to say that only virtue ethicists attend to virtues, any\nmore than it is to say that only consequentialists attend to\nconsequences or only deontologists to rules. Each of the\nabove-mentioned approaches can make room for virtues, consequences,\nand rules. Indeed, any plausible normative ethical theory\nwill have something to say about all three. What distinguishes virtue\nethics from consequentialism or deontology is the centrality of virtue\nwithin the theory (Watson 1990; Kawall 2009). Whereas\nconsequentialists will define virtues as traits that yield good\nconsequences and deontologists will define them as traits possessed by\nthose who reliably fulfil their duties, virtue ethicists will resist\nthe attempt to define virtues in terms of some other concept that is\ntaken to be more fundamental. Rather, virtues and vices will be\nfoundational for virtue ethical theories and other normative notions\nwill be grounded in them.\n\n\nWe begin by discussing two concepts that are central to all forms of\nvirtue ethics, namely, virtue and practical wisdom. Then we note some\nof the features that distinguish different virtue ethical theories\nfrom one another before turning to objections that have been raised\nagainst virtue ethics and responses offered on its behalf. We conclude\nwith a look at some of the directions in which future research might\ndevelop.\n\nIn the West, virtue ethics’ founding fathers are Plato and\nAristotle, and in the East it can be traced back to Mencius and\nConfucius. It persisted as the dominant approach in Western moral\nphilosophy until at least the Enlightenment, suffered a momentary\neclipse during the nineteenth century, but re-emerged in\nAnglo-American philosophy in the late 1950s. It was heralded by\nAnscombe’s famous article “Modern Moral Philosophy”\n(Anscombe 1958) which crystallized an increasing dissatisfaction with\nthe forms of deontology and utilitarianism then prevailing. Neither of\nthem, at that time, paid attention to a number of topics that had\nalways figured in the virtue ethics tradition—virtues and vices,\nmotives and moral character, moral education, moral wisdom or\ndiscernment, friendship and family relationships, a deep concept of\nhappiness, the role of the emotions in our moral life and the\nfundamentally important questions of what sorts of persons we should\nbe and how we should live. \nIts re-emergence had an invigorating effect on the other two\napproaches, many of whose proponents then began to address these\ntopics in the terms of their favoured theory. (One consequence of this\nhas been that it is now necessary to distinguish “virtue\nethics” (the third approach) from “virtue theory”, a\nterm which includes accounts of virtue within the other approaches.)\nInterest in Kant’s virtue theory has redirected\nphilosophers’ attention to Kant’s long neglected\nDoctrine of Virtue, and utilitarians have developed\nconsequentialist virtue theories (Driver 2001; Hurka 2001). It has\nalso generated virtue ethical readings of philosophers other than\nPlato and Aristotle, such as Martineau, Hume and Nietzsche, and\nthereby different forms of virtue ethics have developed (Slote 2001;\nSwanton 2003, 2011a). \nAlthough modern virtue ethics does not have to take a\n“neo-Aristotelian” or eudaimonist form (see section 2),\nalmost any modern version still shows that its roots are in ancient\nGreek philosophy by the employment of three concepts derived from it.\nThese are arête (excellence or virtue),\nphronesis (practical or moral wisdom) and eudaimonia\n(usually translated as happiness or flourishing). (See Annas 2011 for\na short, clear, and authoritative account of all three.) We discuss\nthe first two in the remainder of this section. Eudaimonia is\ndiscussed in connection with eudaimonist versions of virtue ethics in\nthe next.  \nA virtue is an excellent trait of character. It is a disposition, well\nentrenched in its possessor—something that, as we say, goes all\nthe way down, unlike a habit such as being a tea-drinker—to\nnotice, expect, value, feel, desire, choose, act, and react in certain\ncharacteristic ways. To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of\nperson with a certain complex mindset. A significant aspect of this\nmindset is the wholehearted acceptance of a distinctive range of\nconsiderations as reasons for action. An honest person cannot be\nidentified simply as one who, for example, practices honest dealing\nand does not cheat. If such actions are done merely because the agent\nthinks that honesty is the best policy, or because they fear being\ncaught out, rather than through recognising “To do otherwise\nwould be dishonest” as the relevant reason, they are not the\nactions of an honest person. An honest person cannot be identified\nsimply as one who, for example, tells the truth because it is\nthe truth, for one can have the virtue of honesty without being\ntactless or indiscreet. The honest person recognises “That would\nbe a lie” as a strong (though perhaps not overriding) reason for\nnot making certain statements in certain circumstances, and gives due,\nbut not overriding, weight to “That would be the truth” as\na reason for making them.  \nAn honest person’s reasons and choices with respect to honest\nand dishonest actions reflect her views about honesty, truth, and\ndeception—but of course such views manifest themselves with\nrespect to other actions, and to emotional reactions as well. Valuing\nhonesty as she does, she chooses, where possible to work with honest\npeople, to have honest friends, to bring up her children to be honest.\nShe disapproves of, dislikes, deplores dishonesty, is not amused by\ncertain tales of chicanery, despises or pities those who succeed\nthrough deception rather than thinking they have been clever, is\nunsurprised, or pleased (as appropriate) when honesty triumphs, is\nshocked or distressed when those near and dear to her do what is\ndishonest and so on. Given that a virtue is such a multi-track\ndisposition, it would obviously be reckless to attribute one to an\nagent on the basis of a single observed action or even a series of\nsimilar actions, especially if you don’t know the agent’s\nreasons for doing as she did (Sreenivasan 2002). \nPossessing a virtue is a matter of degree. To possess such a\ndisposition fully is to possess full or perfect virtue, which is rare,\nand there are a number of ways of falling short of this ideal\n(Athanassoulis 2000). Most people who can truly be described as fairly\nvirtuous, and certainly markedly better than those who can truly be\ndescribed as dishonest, self-centred and greedy, still have their\nblind spots—little areas where they do not act for the reasons\none would expect. So someone honest or kind in most situations, and\nnotably so in demanding ones, may nevertheless be trivially tainted by\nsnobbery, inclined to be disingenuous about their forebears and less\nthan kind to strangers with the wrong accent. \nFurther, it is not easy to get one’s emotions in harmony with\none’s rational recognition of certain reasons for action. I may\nbe honest enough to recognise that I must own up to a mistake because\nit would be dishonest not to do so without my acceptance being so\nwholehearted that I can own up easily, with no inner conflict.\nFollowing (and adapting) Aristotle, virtue ethicists draw a\ndistinction between full or perfect virtue and\n“continence”, or strength of will. The fully virtuous do\nwhat they should without a struggle against contrary desires; the\ncontinent have to control a desire or temptation to do otherwise. \nDescribing the continent as “falling short” of perfect\nvirtue appears to go against the intuition that there is something\nparticularly admirable about people who manage to act well when it is\nespecially hard for them to do so, but the plausibility of this\ndepends on exactly what “makes it hard” (Foot 1978:\n11–14). If it is the circumstances in which the agent\nacts—say that she is very poor when she sees someone drop a full\npurse or that she is in deep grief when someone visits seeking\nhelp—then indeed it is particularly admirable of her to restore\nthe purse or give the help when it is hard for her to do so. But if\nwhat makes it hard is an imperfection in her character—the\ntemptation to keep what is not hers, or a callous indifference to the\nsuffering of others—then it is not.  \nAnother way in which one can easily fall short of full virtue is\nthrough lacking phronesis—moral or practical\nwisdom. \nThe concept of a virtue is the concept of something that makes its\npossessor good: a virtuous person is a morally good, excellent or\nadmirable person who acts and feels as she should. These are commonly\naccepted truisms. But it is equally common, in relation to particular\n(putative) examples of virtues to give these truisms up. We may say of\nsomeone that he is generous or honest “to a fault”. It is\ncommonly asserted that someone’s compassion might lead them to\nact wrongly, to tell a lie they should not have told, for example, in\ntheir desire to prevent someone else’s hurt feelings. It is also\nsaid that courage, in a desperado, enables him to do far more wicked\nthings than he would have been able to do if he were timid. So it\nwould appear that generosity, honesty, compassion and courage despite\nbeing virtues, are sometimes faults. Someone who is generous, honest,\ncompassionate, and courageous might not be a morally good\nperson—or, if it is still held to be a truism that they are,\nthen morally good people may be led by what makes them morally good to\nact wrongly! How have we arrived at such an odd conclusion? \nThe answer lies in too ready an acceptance of ordinary usage, which\npermits a fairly wide-ranging application of many of the virtue terms,\ncombined, perhaps, with a modern readiness to suppose that the\nvirtuous agent is motivated by emotion or inclination, not by rational\nchoice. If one thinks of generosity or honesty as the\ndisposition to be moved to action by generous or honest impulses such\nas the desire to give or to speak the truth, if one thinks of\ncompassion as the disposition to be moved by the sufferings of others\nand to act on that emotion, if one thinks of courage as mere\nfearlessness or the willingness to face danger, then it will indeed\nseem obvious that these are all dispositions that can lead to their\npossessor’s acting wrongly. But it is also obvious, as soon as\nit is stated, that these are dispositions that can be possessed by\nchildren, and although children thus endowed (bar the\n“courageous” disposition) would undoubtedly be very nice\nchildren, we would not say that they were morally virtuous or\nadmirable people. The ordinary usage, or the reliance on motivation by\ninclination, gives us what Aristotle calls “natural\nvirtue”—a proto version of full virtue awaiting perfection\nby phronesis or practical wisdom. \nAristotle makes a number of specific remarks about phronesis\nthat are the subject of much scholarly debate, but the (related)\nmodern concept is best understood by thinking of what the virtuous\nmorally mature adult has that nice children, including nice\nadolescents, lack. Both the virtuous adult and the nice child have\ngood intentions, but the child is much more prone to mess things up\nbecause he is ignorant of what he needs to know in order to do what he\nintends. A virtuous adult is not, of course, infallible and may also,\non occasion, fail to do what she intended to do through lack of\nknowledge, but only on those occasions on which the lack of knowledge\nis not culpable. So, for example, children and adolescents often harm\nthose they intend to benefit either because they do not know how to\nset about securing the benefit or because their understanding of what\nis beneficial and harmful is limited and often mistaken. Such\nignorance in small children is rarely, if ever culpable. Adults, on\nthe other hand, are culpable if they mess things up by being\nthoughtless, insensitive, reckless, impulsive, shortsighted, and by\nassuming that what suits them will suit everyone instead of taking a\nmore objective viewpoint. They are also culpable if their\nunderstanding of what is beneficial and harmful is mistaken. It is\npart of practical wisdom to know how to secure real benefits\neffectively; those who have practical wisdom will not make the mistake\nof concealing the hurtful truth from the person who really needs to\nknow it in the belief that they are benefiting him. \nQuite generally, given that good intentions are intentions to act well\nor “do the right thing”, we may say that practical wisdom\nis the knowledge or understanding that enables its possessor, unlike\nthe nice adolescents, to do just that, in any given situation. The\ndetailed specification of what is involved in such knowledge or\nunderstanding has not yet appeared in the literature, but some aspects\nof it are becoming well known. Even many deontologists now stress the\npoint that their action-guiding rules cannot, reliably, be applied\nwithout practical wisdom, because correct application requires\nsituational appreciation—the capacity to recognise, in any\nparticular situation, those features of it that are morally salient.\nThis brings out two aspects of practical wisdom. \nOne is that it characteristically comes only with experience of life.\nAmongst the morally relevant features of a situation may be the likely\nconsequences, for the people involved, of a certain action, and this\nis something that adolescents are notoriously clueless about precisely\nbecause they are inexperienced. It is part of practical wisdom to be\nwise about human beings and human life. (It should go without saying\nthat the virtuous are mindful of the consequences of possible actions.\nHow could they fail to be reckless, thoughtless and short-sighted if\nthey were not?) \nThe second is the practically wise agent’s capacity to recognise\nsome features of a situation as more important than others, or indeed,\nin that situation, as the only relevant ones. The wise do not see\nthings in the same way as the nice adolescents who, with their\nunder-developed virtues, still tend to see the personally\ndisadvantageous nature of a certain action as competing in importance\nwith its honesty or benevolence or justice.  \nThese aspects coalesce in the description of the practically wise as\nthose who understand what is truly worthwhile, truly important, and\nthereby truly advantageous in life, who know, in short, how to live\nwell.  \nWhile all forms of virtue ethics agree that virtue is central and\npractical wisdom required, they differ in how they combine these and\nother concepts to illuminate what we should do in particular contexts\nand how we should live our lives as a whole. In what follows we sketch\nfour distinct forms taken by contemporary virtue ethics, namely, a)\neudaimonist virtue ethics, b) agent-based and exemplarist virtue\nethics, c) target-centered virtue ethics, and d) Platonistic virtue\nethics. \nThe distinctive feature of eudaimonist versions of virtue ethics is\nthat they define virtues in terms of their relationship to\neudaimonia. A virtue is a trait that contributes to or is a\nconstituent of eudaimonia and we ought to develop virtues,\nthe eudaimonist claims, precisely because they contribute to\neudaimonia. \nThe concept of eudaimonia, a key term in ancient Greek moral\nphilosophy, is standardly translated as “happiness” or\n“flourishing” and occasionally as\n“well-being.” Each translation has its disadvantages. The\ntrouble with “flourishing” is that animals and even plants\ncan flourish but eudaimonia is possible only for rational\nbeings. The trouble with “happiness” is that in ordinary\nconversation it connotes something subjectively determined. It is for\nme, not for you, to pronounce on whether I am happy. If I think I am\nhappy then I am—it is not something I can be wrong about\n(barring advanced cases of self-deception). Contrast my being healthy\nor flourishing. Here we have no difficulty in recognizing that I might\nthink I was healthy, either physically or psychologically, or think\nthat I was flourishing but be wrong. In this respect,\n“flourishing” is a better translation than\n“happiness”. It is all too easy to be mistaken about\nwhether one’s life is eudaimon (the adjective from\neudaimonia) not simply because it is easy to deceive oneself,\nbut because it is easy to have a mistaken conception of\neudaimonia, or of what it is to live well as a human being,\nbelieving it to consist largely in physical pleasure or luxury for\nexample. \nEudaimonia is, avowedly, a moralized or value-laden concept\nof happiness, something like “true” or “real”\nhappiness or “the sort of happiness worth seeking or\nhaving.” It is thereby the sort of concept about which there can\nbe substantial disagreement between people with different views about\nhuman life that cannot be resolved by appeal to some external standard\non which, despite their different views, the parties to the\ndisagreement concur (Hursthouse 1999: 188–189). \nMost versions of virtue ethics agree that living a life in accordance\nwith virtue is necessary for eudaimonia. This supreme good is\nnot conceived of as an independently defined state (made up of, say, a\nlist of non-moral goods that does not include virtuous activity) which\nexercise of the virtues might be thought to promote. It is, within\nvirtue ethics, already conceived of as something of which virtuous\nactivity is at least partially constitutive (Kraut 1989). Thereby\nvirtue ethicists claim that a human life devoted to physical pleasure\nor the acquisition of wealth is not eudaimon, but a wasted\nlife. \nBut although all standard versions of virtue ethics insist on that\nconceptual link between virtue and eudaimonia,\nfurther links are matters of dispute and generate different versions.\nFor Aristotle, virtue is necessary but not sufficient—what is\nalso needed are external goods which are a matter of luck. For Plato\nand the Stoics, virtue is both necessary and sufficient for\neudaimonia (Annas 1993). \nAccording to eudaimonist virtue ethics, the good life is the\neudaimon life, and the virtues are what enable a human being\nto be eudaimon because the virtues just are those character\ntraits that benefit their possessor in that way, barring bad luck. So\nthere is a link between eudaimonia and what confers virtue\nstatus on a character trait. (For a discussion of the differences\nbetween eudaimonists see Baril 2014. For recent defenses of\neudaimonism see Annas 2011; LeBar 2013b; Badhwar 2014; and Bloomfield\n2014.) \nRather than deriving the normativity of virtue from the value of\neudaimonia, agent-based virtue ethicists argue that other\nforms of normativity—including the value of\neudaimonia—are traced back to and ultimately explained\nin terms of the motivational and dispositional qualities of agents.\n \nIt is unclear how many other forms of normativity must be explained in\nterms of the qualities of agents in order for a theory to count as\nagent-based. The two best-known agent-based theorists, Michael Slote\nand Linda Zagzebski, trace a wide range of normative qualities back to\nthe qualities of agents. For example, Slote defines rightness and\nwrongness in terms of agents’ motivations: “[A]gent-based\nvirtue ethics … understands rightness in terms of good\nmotivations and wrongness in terms of the having of bad (or\ninsufficiently good) motives” (2001: 14). Similarly, he explains\nthe goodness of an action, the value of eudaimonia, the\njustice of a law or social institution, and the normativity of\npractical rationality in terms of the motivational and dispositional\nqualities of agents (2001: 99–100, 154, 2000). Zagzebski\nlikewise defines right and wrong actions by reference to the emotions,\nmotives, and dispositions of virtuous and vicious agents. For example,\n“A wrong act = an act that the phronimos\ncharacteristically would not do, and he would feel guilty if he did =\nan act such that it is not the case that he might do it = an act that\nexpresses a vice = an act that is against a requirement of virtue (the\nvirtuous self)” (Zagzebski 2004: 160). Her definitions of\nduties, good and bad ends, and good and bad states of affairs are\nsimilarly grounded in the motivational and dispositional states of\nexemplary agents (1998, 2004, 2010).  \nHowever, there could also be less ambitious agent-based approaches to\nvirtue ethics (see Slote 1997). At the very least, an agent-based\napproach must be committed to explaining what one should do by\nreference to the motivational and dispositional states of agents. But\nthis is not yet a sufficient condition for counting as an agent-based\napproach, since the same condition will be met by every\nvirtue ethical account. For a theory to count as an agent-based form\nof virtue ethics it must also be the case that the normative\nproperties of motivations and dispositions cannot be explained in\nterms of the normative properties of something else (such as\neudaimonia or states of affairs) which is taken to be more\nfundamental.  \nBeyond this basic commitment, there is room for agent-based theories\nto be developed in a number of different directions. The most\nimportant distinguishing factor has to do with how motivations and\ndispositions are taken to matter for the purposes of explaining other\nnormative qualities. For Slote what matters are this particular\nagent’s actual motives and dispositions. The goodness of\naction A, for example, is derived from the agent’s motives when\nshe performs A. If those motives are good then the action is good, if\nnot then not. On Zagzebski’s account, by contrast, a good or\nbad, right or wrong action is defined not by this agent’s actual\nmotives but rather by whether this is the sort of action a virtuously\nmotivated agent would perform (Zagzebski 2004: 160). Appeal to the\nvirtuous agent’s hypothetical motives and dispositions\nenables Zagzebski to distinguish between performing the right action\nand doing so for the right reasons (a distinction that, as Brady\n(2004) observes, Slote has trouble drawing). \nAnother point on which agent-based forms of virtue ethics might differ\nconcerns how one identifies virtuous motivations and dispositions.\nAccording to Zagzebski’s exemplarist account, “We do not\nhave criteria for goodness in advance of identifying the exemplars of\ngoodness” (Zagzebski 2004: 41). As we observe the people around\nus, we find ourselves wanting to be like some of them (in at least\nsome respects) and not wanting to be like others. The former provide\nus with positive exemplars and the latter with negative ones. Our\nunderstanding of better and worse motivations and virtuous and vicious\ndispositions is grounded in these primitive responses to exemplars\n(2004: 53). This is not to say that every time we act we stop and ask\nourselves what one of our exemplars would do in this situations. Our\nmoral concepts become more refined over time as we encounter a wider\nvariety of exemplars and begin to draw systematic connections between\nthem, noting what they have in common, how they differ, and which of\nthese commonalities and differences matter, morally speaking.\nRecognizable motivational profiles emerge and come to be labeled as\nvirtues or vices, and these, in turn, shape our understanding of the\nobligations we have and the ends we should pursue. However, even\nthough the systematising of moral thought can travel a long way from\nour starting point, according to the exemplarist it never reaches a\nstage where reference to exemplars is replaced by the recognition of\nsomething more fundamental. At the end of the day, according to the\nexemplarist, our moral system still rests on our basic propensity to\ntake a liking (or disliking) to exemplars. Nevertheless, one could be\nan agent-based theorist without advancing the exemplarist’s\naccount of the origins or reference conditions for judgments of good\nand bad, virtuous and vicious. \nThe touchstone for eudaimonist virtue ethicists is a flourishing human\nlife. For agent-based virtue ethicists it is an exemplary\nagent’s motivations. The target-centered view developed by\nChristine Swanton (2003), by contrast, begins with our existing\nconceptions of the virtues. We already have a passable idea of which\ntraits are virtues and what they involve. Of course, this untutored\nunderstanding can be clarified and improved, and it is one of the\ntasks of the virtue ethicist to help us do precisely that. But rather\nthan stripping things back to something as basic as the motivations we\nwant to imitate or building it up to something as elaborate as an\nentire flourishing life, the target-centered view begins where most\nethics students find themselves, namely, with the idea that\ngenerosity, courage, self-discipline, compassion, and the like get a\ntick of approval. It then examines what these traits involve. \nA complete account of virtue will map out 1) its field, 2)\nits mode of responsiveness, 3) its basis of moral\nacknowledgment, and 4) its target. Different virtues are\nconcerned with different fields. Courage, for example, is\nconcerned with what might harm us, whereas generosity is concerned\nwith the sharing of time, talent, and property. The basis of\nacknowledgment of a virtue is the feature within the virtue’s\nfield to which it responds. To continue with our previous examples,\ngenerosity is attentive to the benefits that others might enjoy\nthrough one’s agency, and courage responds to threats to value,\nstatus, or the bonds that exist between oneself and particular others,\nand the fear such threats might generate. A virtue’s\nmode has to do with how it responds to the bases of\nacknowledgment within its field. Generosity promotes a good,\nnamely, another’s benefit, whereas courage defends a\nvalue, bond, or status. Finally, a virtue’s target is\nthat at which it is aimed. Courage aims to control fear and handle\ndanger, while generosity aims to share time, talents, or possessions\nwith others in ways that benefit them. \nA virtue, on a target-centered account, “is a\ndisposition to respond to, or acknowledge, items within its field or\nfields in an excellent or good enough way” (Swanton 2003: 19). A\nvirtuous act is an act that hits the target of a virtue,\nwhich is to say that it succeeds in responding to items in its field\nin the specified way (233). Providing a target-centered definition of\na right action requires us to move beyond the analysis of a\nsingle virtue and the actions that follow from it. This is because a\nsingle action context may involve a number of different, overlapping\nfields. Determination might lead me to persist in trying to complete a\ndifficult task even if doing so requires a singleness of purpose. But\nlove for my family might make a different use of my time and\nattention. In order to define right action a target-centered view must\nexplain how we handle different virtues’ conflicting claims on\nour resources. There are at least three different ways to address this\nchallenge. A perfectionist target-centered account would\nstipulate, “An act is right if and only if it is overall\nvirtuous, and that entails that it is the, or a, best action possible\nin the circumstances” (239–240). A more\npermissive target-centered account would not identify\n‘right’ with ‘best’, but would allow an action\nto count as right provided “it is good enough even if not the\n(or a) best action” (240). A minimalist target-centered\naccount would not even require an action to be good in order to be\nright. On such a view, “An act is right if and only if it is not\noverall vicious” (240). (For further discussion of\ntarget-centered virtue ethics see Van Zyl 2014; and Smith 2016). \nThe fourth form a virtue ethic might adopt takes its inspiration from\nPlato. The Socrates of Plato’s dialogues devotes a great deal of\ntime to asking his fellow Athenians to explain the nature of virtues\nlike justice, courage, piety, and wisdom. So it is clear that Plato\ncounts as a virtue theorist. But it is a matter of some debate whether\nhe should be read as a virtue ethicist (White 2015). What is not open\nto debate is whether Plato has had an important influence on the\ncontemporary revival of interest in virtue ethics. A number of those\nwho have contributed to the revival have done so as Plato scholars\n(e.g., Prior 1991; Kamtekar 1998; Annas 1999; and Reshotko 2006).\nHowever, often they have ended up championing a eudaimonist version of\nvirtue ethics (see Prior 2001 and Annas 2011), rather than a version\nthat would warrant a separate classification. Nevertheless, there are\ntwo variants that call for distinct treatment. \nTimothy Chappell takes the defining feature of Platonistic virtue\nethics to be that “Good agency in the truest and fullest sense\npresupposes the contemplation of the Form of the Good” (2014).\nChappell follows Iris Murdoch in arguing that “In the moral life\nthe enemy is the fat relentless ego” (Murdoch 1971: 51).\nConstantly attending to our needs, our desires, our passions, and our\nthoughts skews our perspective on what the world is actually like and\nblinds us to the goods around us. Contemplating the goodness of\nsomething we encounter—which is to say, carefully attending to\nit “for its own sake, in order to understand it” (Chappell\n2014: 300)—breaks this natural tendency by drawing our attention\naway from ourselves. Contemplating such goodness with regularity makes\nroom for new habits of thought that focus more readily and more\nhonestly on things other than the self. It alters the quality of our\nconsciousness. And “anything which alters consciousness in the\ndirection of unselfishness, objectivity, and realism is to be\nconnected with virtue” (Murdoch 1971: 82). The virtues get\ndefined, then, in terms of qualities that help one “pierce the\nveil of selfish consciousness and join the world as it really\nis” (91). And good agency is defined by the possession and\nexercise of such virtues. Within Chappell’s and Murdoch’s\nframework, then, not all normative properties get defined in terms of\nvirtue. Goodness, in particular, is not so defined. But the kind of\ngoodness which is possible for creatures like us is defined by virtue,\nand any answer to the question of what one should do or how one should\nlive will appeal to the virtues. \nAnother Platonistic variant of virtue ethics is exemplified by Robert\nMerrihew Adams. Unlike Murdoch and Chappell, his starting point is not\na set of claims about our consciousness of goodness. Rather, he begins\nwith an account of the metaphysics of goodness. Like Murdoch and\nothers influenced by Platonism, Adams’s account of goodness is\nbuilt around a conception of a supremely perfect good. And like\nAugustine, Adams takes that perfect good to be God. God is both the\nexemplification and the source of all goodness. Other things are good,\nhe suggests, to the extent that they resemble God (Adams 1999). \nThe resemblance requirement identifies a necessary condition for being\ngood, but it does not yet give us a sufficient condition. This is\nbecause there are ways in which finite creatures might resemble God\nthat would not be suitable to the type of creature they are. For\nexample, if God were all-knowing, then the belief, “I am\nall-knowing,” would be a suitable belief for God to have. In\nGod, such a belief—because true—would be part of\nGod’s perfection. However, as neither you nor I are all-knowing,\nthe belief, “I am all-knowing,” in one of us would not be\ngood. To rule out such cases we need to introduce another factor. That\nfactor is the fitting response to goodness, which Adams suggests is\nlove. Adams uses love to weed out problematic resemblances:\n“being excellent in the way that a finite thing can be consists\nin resembling God in a way that could serve God as a reason for loving\nthe thing” (Adams 1999: 36). \nVirtues come into the account as one of the ways in which some things\n(namely, persons) could resemble God. “[M]ost of the excellences\nthat are most important to us, and of whose value we are most\nconfident, are excellences of persons or of qualities or actions or\nworks or lives or stories of persons” (1999: 42). This is one of\nthe reasons Adams offers for conceiving of the ideal of perfection as\na personal God, rather than an impersonal form of the Good. Many of\nthe excellences of persons of which we are most confident are virtues\nsuch as love, wisdom, justice, patience, and generosity. And within\nmany theistic traditions, including Adams’s own Christian\ntradition, such virtues are commonly attributed to divine agents. \nA Platonistic account like the one Adams puts forward in Finite\nand Infinite Goods clearly does not derive all other normative\nproperties from the virtues (for a discussion of the relationship\nbetween this view and the one he puts forward in A Theory of\nVirtue (2006) see Pettigrove 2014). Goodness provides the\nnormative foundation. Virtues are not built on that foundation;\nrather, as one of the varieties of goodness of whose value we are most\nconfident, virtues form part of the foundation. Obligations, by\ncontrast, come into the account at a different level. Moral\nobligations, Adams argues, are determined by the expectations and\ndemands that “arise in a relationship or system of relationships\nthat is good or valuable” (1999: 244). Other things being equal,\nthe more virtuous the parties to the relationship, the more binding\nthe obligation. Thus, within Adams’s account, the good (which\nincludes virtue) is prior to the right. However, once good\nrelationships have given rise to obligations, those obligations take\non a life of their own. Their bindingness is not traced directly to\nconsiderations of goodness. Rather, they are determined by the\nexpectations of the parties and the demands of the relationship. \nA number of objections have been raised against virtue ethics, some of\nwhich bear more directly on one form of virtue ethics than on others.\nIn this section we consider eight objections, namely, the a)\napplication, b) adequacy, c) relativism, d) conflict, e)\nself-effacement, f) justification, g) egoism, and h) situationist\nproblems.  \na) In the early days of virtue ethics’ revival, the approach was\nassociated with an “anti-codifiability” thesis about\nethics, directed against the prevailing pretensions of normative\ntheory. At the time, utilitarians and deontologists commonly (though\nnot universally) held that the task of ethical theory was to come up\nwith a code consisting of universal rules or principles (possibly only\none, as in the case of act-utilitarianism) which would have two\nsignificant features: i) the rule(s) would amount to a decision\nprocedure for determining what the right action was in any particular\ncase; ii) the rule(s) would be stated in such terms that any\nnon-virtuous person could understand and apply it (them) correctly.\n \nVirtue ethicists maintained, contrary to these two claims, that it was\nquite unrealistic to imagine that there could be such a code (see, in\nparticular, McDowell 1979). The results of attempts to produce and\nemploy such a code, in the heady days of the 1960s and 1970s, when\nmedical and then bioethics boomed and bloomed, tended to support the\nvirtue ethicists’ claim. More and more utilitarians and\ndeontologists found themselves agreed on their general rules but on\nopposite sides of the controversial moral issues in contemporary\ndiscussion. It came to be recognised that moral sensitivity,\nperception, imagination, and judgement informed by\nexperience—phronesis in short—is needed to apply\nrules or principles correctly. Hence many (though by no means all)\nutilitarians and deontologists have explicitly abandoned (ii) and much\nless emphasis is placed on (i). \nNevertheless, the complaint that virtue ethics does not produce\ncodifiable principles is still a commonly voiced criticism of the\napproach, expressed as the objection that it is, in principle, unable\nto provide action-guidance. \nInitially, the objection was based on a misunderstanding. Blinkered by\nslogans that described virtue ethics as “concerned with Being\nrather than Doing”, as addressing “What sort of person\nshould I be?” but not “What should I do?” as being\n“agent-centered rather than act-centered”, its critics\nmaintained that it was unable to provide action-guidance and hence,\nrather than being a normative rival to utilitarian and deontological\nethics, could claim to be no more than a valuable supplement to them.\nThe rather odd idea was that all virtue ethics could offer was\n“Identify a moral exemplar and do what he would do” as\nthough the raped fifteen-year-old trying to decide whether or not to\nhave an abortion was supposed to ask herself “Would Socrates\nhave had an abortion if he were in my circumstances?” \nBut the objection failed to take note of Anscombe’s hint that a\ngreat deal of specific action guidance could be found in rules\nemploying the virtue and vice terms (“v-rules”) such as\n“Do what is honest/charitable; do not do what is\ndishonest/uncharitable” (Hursthouse 1999). (It is a noteworthy\nfeature of our virtue and vice vocabulary that, although our list of\ngenerally recognised virtue terms is comparatively short, our list of\nvice terms is remarkably, and usefully, long, far exceeding anything\nthat anyone who thinks in terms of standard deontological rules has\never come up with. Much invaluable action guidance comes from avoiding\ncourses of action that would be irresponsible, feckless, lazy,\ninconsiderate, uncooperative, harsh, intolerant, selfish, mercenary,\nindiscreet, tactless, arrogant, unsympathetic, cold, incautious,\nunenterprising, pusillanimous, feeble, presumptuous, rude,\nhypocritical, self-indulgent, materialistic, grasping, short-sighted,\nvindictive, calculating, ungrateful, grudging, brutal, profligate,\ndisloyal, and on and on.) \n(b) A closely related objection has to do with whether virtue ethics\ncan provide an adequate account of right action. This worry can take\ntwo forms. (i) One might think a virtue ethical account of right\naction is extensionally inadequate. It is possible to perform a right\naction without being virtuous and a virtuous person can occasionally\nperform the wrong action without that calling her virtue into\nquestion. If virtue is neither necessary nor sufficient for right\naction, one might wonder whether the relationship between\nrightness/wrongness and virtue/vice is close enough for the former to\nbe identified in terms of the latter. (ii) Alternatively, even if one\nthought it possible to produce a virtue ethical account that picked\nout all (and only) right actions, one might still think that at least\nin some cases virtue is not what explains rightness (Adams\n2006:6–8). \nSome virtue ethicists respond to the adequacy objection by rejecting\nthe assumption that virtue ethics ought to be in the business of\nproviding an account of right action in the first place. Following in\nthe footsteps of Anscombe (1958) and MacIntyre (1985), Talbot Brewer\n(2009) argues that to work with the categories of rightness and\nwrongness is already to get off on the wrong foot. Contemporary\nconceptions of right and wrong action, built as they are around a\nnotion of moral duty that presupposes a framework of divine (or moral)\nlaw or around a conception of obligation that is defined in contrast\nto self-interest, carry baggage the virtue ethicist is better off\nwithout. Virtue ethics can address the questions of how one should\nlive, what kind of person one should become, and even what one should\ndo without that committing it to providing an account of ‘right\naction’. One might choose, instead, to work with aretaic\nconcepts (defined in terms of virtues and vices) and axiological\nconcepts (defined in terms of good and bad, better and worse) and\nleave out deontic notions (like right/wrong action, duty, and\nobligation) altogether. \nOther virtue ethicists wish to retain the concept of right action but\nnote that in the current philosophical discussion a number of distinct\nqualities march under that banner. In some contexts, ‘right\naction’ identifies the best action an agent might perform in the\ncircumstances. In others, it designates an action that is commendable\n(even if not the best possible). In still others, it picks out actions\nthat are not blameworthy (even if not commendable). A virtue ethicist\nmight choose to define one of these—for example, the best\naction—in terms of virtues and vices, but appeal to other\nnormative concepts—such as legitimate expectations—when\ndefining other conceptions of right action. \nAs we observed in section 2, a virtue ethical account need not attempt\nto reduce all other normative concepts to virtues and vices.\nWhat is required is simply (i) that virtue is not reduced to\nsome other normative concept that is taken to be more fundamental and\n(ii) that some other normative concepts are explained in\nterms of virtue and vice. This takes the sting out of the adequacy\nobjection, which is most compelling against versions of virtue ethics\nthat attempt to define all of the senses of ‘right action’\nin terms of virtues. Appealing to virtues and vices makes it\nmuch easier to achieve extensional adequacy. Making room for normative\nconcepts that are not taken to be reducible to virtue and vice\nconcepts makes it even easier to generate a theory that is both\nextensionally and explanatorily adequate. Whether one needs other\nconcepts and, if so, how many, is still a matter of debate among\nvirtue ethicists, as is the question of whether virtue ethics even\nought to be offering an account of right action. Either way virtue\nethicists have resources available to them to address the adequacy\nobjection. \nInsofar as the different versions of virtue ethics all retain an\nemphasis on the virtues, they are open to the familiar problem of (c)\nthe charge of cultural relativity. Is it not the case that different\ncultures embody different virtues, (MacIntyre 1985) and hence that the\nv-rules will pick out actions as right or wrong only relative to a\nparticular culture? Different replies have been made to this charge.\nOne—the tu quoque, or “partners in crime”\nresponse—exhibits a quite familiar pattern in virtue\nethicists’ defensive strategy (Solomon 1988). They admit that,\nfor them, cultural relativism is a challenge, but point out\nthat it is just as much a problem for the other two approaches. The\n(putative) cultural variation in character traits regarded as virtues\nis no greater—indeed markedly less—than the cultural\nvariation in rules of conduct, and different cultures have different\nideas about what constitutes happiness or welfare. That cultural\nrelativity should be a problem common to all three approaches is\nhardly surprising. It is related, after all, to the\n“justification problem”\n (see below)\n the quite general metaethical problem of justifying one’s moral\nbeliefs to those who disagree, whether they be moral sceptics,\npluralists or from another culture. \nA bolder strategy involves claiming that virtue ethics has less\ndifficulty with cultural relativity than the other two approaches.\nMuch cultural disagreement arises, it may be claimed, from local\nunderstandings of the virtues, but the virtues themselves are not\nrelative to culture (Nussbaum 1993). \nAnother objection to which the tu quoque response is\npartially appropriate is (d) “the conflict problem.” What\ndoes virtue ethics have to say about dilemmas—cases in which,\napparently, the requirements of different virtues conflict because\nthey point in opposed directions? Charity prompts me to kill the\nperson who would be better off dead, but justice forbids it. Honesty\npoints to telling the hurtful truth, kindness and compassion to\nremaining silent or even lying. What shall I do? Of course, the same\nsorts of dilemmas are generated by conflicts between deontological\nrules. Deontology and virtue ethics share the conflict problem (and\nare happy to take it on board rather than follow some of the\nutilitarians in their consequentialist resolutions of such dilemmas)\nand in fact their strategies for responding to it are parallel. Both\naim to resolve a number of dilemmas by arguing that the conflict is\nmerely apparent; a discriminating understanding of the virtues or\nrules in question, possessed only by those with practical wisdom, will\nperceive that, in this particular case, the virtues do not make\nopposing demands or that one rule outranks another, or has a certain\nexception clause built into it. Whether this is all there is to it\ndepends on whether there are any irresolvable dilemmas. If there are,\nproponents of either normative approach may point out reasonably that\nit could only be a mistake to offer a resolution of what is, ex\nhypothesi, irresolvable. \nAnother problem arguably shared by all three approaches is (e), that\nof being self-effacing. An ethical theory is self-effacing if,\nroughly, whatever it claims justifies a particular action, or makes it\nright, had better not be the agent’s motive for doing it.\nMichael Stocker (1976) originally introduced it as a problem for\ndeontology and consequentialism. He pointed out that the agent who,\nrightly, visits a friend in hospital will rather lessen the impact of\nhis visit on her if he tells her either that he is doing it because it\nis his duty or because he thought it would maximize the general\nhappiness. But as Simon Keller observes, she won’t be any better\npleased if he tells her that he is visiting her because it is what a\nvirtuous agent would do, so virtue ethics would appear to have the\nproblem too (Keller 2007). However, virtue ethics’ defenders\nhave argued that not all forms of virtue ethics are subject to this\nobjection (Pettigrove 2011) and those that are are not seriously\nundermined by the problem (Martinez 2011). \nAnother problem for virtue ethics, which is shared by both\nutilitarianism and deontology, is (f)\n “the justification problem.”\n Abstractly conceived, this is the problem of how we justify or ground\nour ethical beliefs, an issue that is hotly debated at the level of\nmetaethics. In its particular versions, for deontology there is the\nquestion of how to justify its claims that certain moral rules are the\ncorrect ones, and for utilitarianism of how to justify its claim that\nall that really matters morally are consequences for happiness or\nwell-being. For virtue ethics, the problem concerns the question of\nwhich character traits are the virtues. \nIn the metaethical debate, there is widespread disagreement about the\npossibility of providing an external foundation for\nethics—“external” in the sense of being external to\nethical beliefs—and the same disagreement is found amongst\ndeontologists and utilitarians. Some believe that their normative\nethics can be placed on a secure basis, resistant to any form of\nscepticism, such as what anyone rationally desires, or would accept or\nagree on, regardless of their ethical outlook; others that it\ncannot. \nVirtue ethicists have eschewed any attempt to ground virtue ethics in\nan external foundation while continuing to maintain that their claims\ncan be validated. Some follow a form of Rawls’s coherentist\napproach (Slote 2001; Swanton 2003); neo-Aristotelians a form of\nethical naturalism. \nA misunderstanding of eudaimonia as an unmoralized concept\nleads some critics to suppose that the neo-Aristotelians are\nattempting to ground their claims in a scientific account of human\nnature and what counts, for a human being, as flourishing. Others\nassume that, if this is not what they are doing, they cannot be\nvalidating their claims that, for example, justice, charity, courage,\nand generosity are virtues. Either they are illegitimately helping\nthemselves to Aristotle’s discredited natural teleology\n(Williams 1985) or producing mere rationalizations of their own\npersonal or culturally inculcated values. But McDowell, Foot,\nMacIntyre and Hursthouse have all outlined versions of a third way\nbetween these two extremes. Eudaimonia in virtue ethics, is\nindeed a moralized concept, but it is not only that. Claims about what\nconstitutes flourishing for human beings no more float free of\nscientific facts about what human beings are like than ethological\nclaims about what constitutes flourishing for elephants. In both\ncases, the truth of the claims depends in part on what kind\nof animal they are and what capacities, desires and interests the\nhumans or elephants have. \nThe best available science today (including evolutionary theory and\npsychology) supports rather than undermines the ancient Greek\nassumption that we are social animals, like elephants and wolves and\nunlike polar bears. No rationalizing explanation in terms of anything\nlike a social contract is needed to explain why we choose to live\ntogether, subjugating our egoistic desires in order to secure the\nadvantages of co-operation. Like other social animals, our natural\nimpulses are not solely directed towards our own pleasures and\npreservation, but include altruistic and cooperative ones. \nThis basic fact about us should make more comprehensible the claim\nthat the virtues are at least partially constitutive of human\nflourishing and also undercut the objection that virtue ethics is, in\nsome sense, egoistic. \n(g) The egoism objection has a number of sources. One is a simple\nconfusion. Once it is understood that the fully virtuous agent\ncharacteristically does what she should without inner conflict, it is\ntriumphantly asserted that “she is only doing what she\nwants to do and hence is being selfish.” So when the\ngenerous person gives gladly, as the generous are wont to do, it turns\nout she is not generous and unselfish after all, or at least not as\ngenerous as the one who greedily wants to hang on to everything she\nhas but forces herself to give because she thinks she should! A\nrelated version ascribes bizarre reasons to the virtuous agent,\nunjustifiably assuming that she acts as she does because she\nbelieves that acting thus on this occasion will help her to achieve\neudaimonia. But “the virtuous agent” is just\n“the agent with the virtues” and it is part of our\nordinary understanding of the virtue terms that each carries with it\nits own typical range of reasons for acting. The virtuous agent acts\nas she does because she believes that someone’s suffering will\nbe averted, or someone benefited, or the truth established, or a debt\nrepaid, or … thereby. \nIt is the exercise of the virtues during one’s life that is held\nto be at least partially constitutive of eudaimonia, and this\nis consistent with recognising that bad luck may land the virtuous\nagent in circumstances that require her to give up her life. Given the\nsorts of considerations that courageous, honest, loyal, charitable\npeople wholeheartedly recognise as reasons for action, they may find\nthemselves compelled to face danger for a worthwhile end, to speak out\nin someone’s defence, or refuse to reveal the names of their\ncomrades, even when they know that this will inevitably lead to their\nexecution, to share their last crust and face starvation. On the view\nthat the exercise of the virtues is necessary but not sufficient for\neudaimonia, such cases are described as those in which the\nvirtuous agent sees that, as things have unfortunately turned out,\neudaimonia is not possible for them (Foot 2001, 95). On the\nStoical view that it is both necessary and sufficient, a\neudaimon life is a life that has been successfully lived\n(where “success” of course is not to be understood in a\nmaterialistic way) and such people die knowing not only that they have\nmade a success of their lives but that they have also brought their\nlives to a markedly successful completion. Either way, such heroic\nacts can hardly be regarded as egoistic. \nA lingering suggestion of egoism may be found in the misconceived\ndistinction between so-called “self-regarding” and\n“other-regarding” virtues. Those who have been insulated\nfrom the ancient tradition tend to regard justice and benevolence as\nreal virtues, which benefit others but not their possessor, and\nprudence, fortitude and providence (the virtue whose opposite is\n“improvidence” or being a spendthrift) as not real virtues\nat all because they benefit only their possessor. This is a mistake on\ntwo counts. Firstly, justice and benevolence do, in general, benefit\ntheir possessors, since without them eudaimonia is not\npossible. Secondly, given that we live together, as social animals,\nthe “self-regarding” virtues do benefit others—those\nwho lack them are a great drain on, and sometimes grief to, those who\nare close to them (as parents with improvident or imprudent adult\noffspring know only too well). \nThe most recent objection (h) to virtue ethics claims that work in\n“situationist” social psychology shows that there are no\nsuch things as character traits and thereby no such things as virtues\nfor virtue ethics to be about (Doris 1998; Harman 1999). In reply,\nsome virtue ethicists have argued that the social psychologists’\nstudies are irrelevant to the multi-track disposition (see above) that\na virtue is supposed to be (Sreenivasan 2002; Kamtekar 2004). Mindful\nof just how multi-track it is, they agree that it would be reckless in\nthe extreme to ascribe a demanding virtue such as charity to people of\nwhom they know no more than that they have exhibited conventional\ndecency; this would indeed be “a fundamental attribution\nerror.” Others have worked to develop alternative, empirically\ngrounded conceptions of character traits (Snow 2010; Miller 2013 and\n2014; however see Upton 2016 for objections to Miller). There have\nbeen other responses as well (summarized helpfully in Prinz 2009 and\nMiller 2014). Notable among these is a response by Adams (2006,\nechoing Merritt 2000) who steers a middle road between “no\ncharacter traits at all” and the exacting standard of the\nAristotelian conception of virtue which, because of its emphasis on\nphronesis, requires a high level of character integration. On his\nconception, character traits may be “frail and\nfragmentary” but still virtues, and not uncommon. But giving up\nthe idea that practical wisdom is the heart of all the virtues, as\nAdams has to do, is a substantial sacrifice, as Russell (2009) and\nKamtekar (2010) argue. \nEven though the “situationist challenge” has left\ntraditional virtue ethicists unmoved, it has generated a healthy\nengagement with empirical psychological literature, which has also\nbeen fuelled by the growing literature on Foot’s Natural\nGoodness and, quite independently, an upsurge of interest in\ncharacter education (see below). \nOver the past thirty-five years most of those contributing to the\nrevival of virtue ethics have worked within a neo-Aristotelian,\neudaimonist framework. However, as noted in section 2, other forms of\nvirtue ethics have begun to emerge. Theorists have begun to turn to\nphilosophers like Hutcheson, Hume, Nietzsche, Martineau, and Heidegger\nfor resources they might use to develop alternatives (see Russell\n2006; Swanton 2013 and 2015; Taylor 2015; and Harcourt 2015). Others\nhave turned their attention eastward, exploring Confucian, Buddhist,\nand Hindu traditions (Yu 2007; Slingerland 2011; Finnigan and Tanaka\n2011; McRae 2012; Angle and Slote 2013; Davis 2014; Flanagan 2015;\nPerrett and Pettigrove 2015; and Sim 2015). These explorations promise\nto open up new avenues for the development of virtue ethics. \nAlthough virtue ethics has grown remarkably in the last thirty-five\nyears, it is still very much in the minority, particularly in the area\nof applied ethics. Many editors of big textbook collections on\n“moral problems” or “applied ethics” now try\nto include articles representative of each of the three normative\napproaches but are often unable to find a virtue ethics article\naddressing a particular issue. This is sometimes, no doubt, because\n“the” issue has been set up as a\ndeontologicial/utilitarian debate, but it is often simply because no\nvirtue ethicist has yet written on the topic. However, the last decade\nhas seen an increase in the amount of attention applied virtue ethics\nhas received (Walker and Ivanhoe 2007; Hartman 2013; Austin 2014; Van\nHooft 2014; and Annas 2015). This area can certainly be expected to\ngrow in the future, and it looks as though applying virtue ethics in\nthe field of environmental ethics may prove particularly fruitful\n(Sandler 2007; Hursthouse 2007, 2011; Zwolinski and Schmidtz 2013;\nCafaro 2015). \nWhether virtue ethics can be expected to grow into “virtue\npolitics”—i.e. to extend from moral philosophy into\npolitical philosophy—is not so clear. Gisela Striker (2006) has\nargued that Aristotle’s ethics cannot be understood adequately\nwithout attending to its place in his politics. That suggests that at\nleast those virtue ethicists who take their inspiration from Aristotle\nshould have resources to offer for the development of virtue politics.\nBut, while Plato and Aristotle can be great inspirations as far as\nvirtue ethics is concerned, neither, on the face of it, are attractive\nsources of insight where politics is concerned. However, recent work\nsuggests that Aristotelian ideas can, after all, generate a\nsatisfyingly liberal political philosophy (Nussbaum 2006; LeBar\n2013a). Moreover, as noted above, virtue ethics does not have to be\nneo-Aristotelian. It may be that the virtue ethics of Hutcheson and\nHume can be naturally extended into a modern political philosophy\n(Hursthouse 1990–91; Slote 1993). \nFollowing Plato and Aristotle, modern virtue ethics has always\nemphasised the importance of moral education, not as the inculcation\nof rules but as the training of character. There is now a growing\nmovement towards virtues education, amongst both academics (Carr 1999;\nAthanassoulis 2014; Curren 2015) and teachers in the classroom. One\nexciting thing about research in this area is its engagement with\nother academic disciplines, including psychology, educational theory,\nand theology (see Cline 2015; and Snow 2015). \nFinally, one of the more productive developments of virtue ethics has\ncome through the study of particular virtues and vices. There are now\na number of careful studies of the cardinal virtues and capital vices\n(Pieper 1966; Taylor 2006; Curzer 2012; Timpe and Boyd 2014). Others\nhave explored less widely discussed virtues or vices, such as\ncivility, decency, truthfulness, ambition, and meekness (Calhoun 2000;\nKekes 2002; Williams 2002; and Pettigrove 2007 and 2012). One of the\nquestions these studies raise is “How many virtues are\nthere?” A second is, “How are these virtues related to one\nanother?” Some virtue ethicists have been happy to work on the\nassumption that there is no principled reason for limiting the number\nof virtues and plenty of reason for positing a plurality of them\n(Swanton 2003; Battaly 2015). Others have been concerned that such an\nopen-handed approach to the virtues will make it difficult for virtue\nethicists to come up with an adequate account of right action or deal\nwith the conflict problem discussed above. Dan Russell has proposed\ncardinality and a version of the unity thesis as a solution to what he\ncalls “the enumeration problem” (the problem of too many\nvirtues). The apparent proliferation of virtues can be significantly\nreduced if we group virtues together with some being cardinal and\nothers subordinate extensions of those cardinal virtues. Possible\nconflicts between the remaining virtues can then be managed if they\nare tied together in some way as part of a unified whole (Russell\n2009). This highlights two important avenues for future research, one\nof which explores individual virtues and the other of which analyses\nhow they might be related to one another.

It may, initially, be identified as the one that emphasizes\nthe virtues, or moral character, in contrast to the approach that\nemphasizes duties or rules (deontology) or that emphasizes the\nconsequences of actions (consequentialism). Suppose it is obvious that\nsomeone in need should be helped. A utilitarian will point to the fact\nthat the consequences of doing so will maximize well-being, a\ndeontologist to the fact that, in doing so the agent will be acting in\naccordance with a moral rule such as “Do unto others as you\nwould be done by” and a virtue ethicist to the fact that helping\nthe person would be charitable or benevolent.\n\n\nThis is not to say that only virtue ethicists attend to virtues, any\nmore than it is to say that only consequentialists attend to\nconsequences or only deontologists to rules. Each of the\nabove-mentioned approaches can make room for virtues, consequences,\nand rules. Indeed, any plausible normative ethical theory\nwill have something to say about all three. What distinguishes virtue\nethics from consequentialism or deontology is the centrality of virtue\nwithin the theory (Watson 1990; Kawall 2009). Whereas\nconsequentialists will define virtues as traits that yield good\nconsequences and deontologists will define them as traits possessed by\nthose who reliably fulfil their duties, virtue ethicists will resist\nthe attempt to define virtues in terms of some other concept that is\ntaken to be more fundamental. Rather, virtues and vices will be\nfoundational for virtue ethical theories and other normative notions\nwill be grounded in them.\n\n\nWe begin by discussing two concepts that are central to all forms of\nvirtue ethics, namely, virtue and practical wisdom. Then we note some\nof the features that distinguish different virtue ethical theories\nfrom one another before turning to objections that have been raised\nagainst virtue ethics and responses offered on its behalf. We conclude\nwith a look at some of the directions in which future research might\ndevelop.\n\nIn the West, virtue ethics’ founding fathers are Plato and\nAristotle, and in the East it can be traced back to Mencius and\nConfucius. It persisted as the dominant approach in Western moral\nphilosophy until at least the Enlightenment, suffered a momentary\neclipse during the nineteenth century, but re-emerged in\nAnglo-American philosophy in the late 1950s. It was heralded by\nAnscombe’s famous article “Modern Moral Philosophy”\n(Anscombe 1958) which crystallized an increasing dissatisfaction with\nthe forms of deontology and utilitarianism then prevailing. Neither of\nthem, at that time, paid attention to a number of topics that had\nalways figured in the virtue ethics tradition—virtues and vices,\nmotives and moral character, moral education, moral wisdom or\ndiscernment, friendship and family relationships, a deep concept of\nhappiness, the role of the emotions in our moral life and the\nfundamentally important questions of what sorts of persons we should\nbe and how we should live. \nIts re-emergence had an invigorating effect on the other two\napproaches, many of whose proponents then began to address these\ntopics in the terms of their favoured theory. (One consequence of this\nhas been that it is now necessary to distinguish “virtue\nethics” (the third approach) from “virtue theory”, a\nterm which includes accounts of virtue within the other approaches.)\nInterest in Kant’s virtue theory has redirected\nphilosophers’ attention to Kant’s long neglected\nDoctrine of Virtue, and utilitarians have developed\nconsequentialist virtue theories (Driver 2001; Hurka 2001). It has\nalso generated virtue ethical readings of philosophers other than\nPlato and Aristotle, such as Martineau, Hume and Nietzsche, and\nthereby different forms of virtue ethics have developed (Slote 2001;\nSwanton 2003, 2011a). \nAlthough modern virtue ethics does not have to take a\n“neo-Aristotelian” or eudaimonist form (see section 2),\nalmost any modern version still shows that its roots are in ancient\nGreek philosophy by the employment of three concepts derived from it.\nThese are arête (excellence or virtue),\nphronesis (practical or moral wisdom) and eudaimonia\n(usually translated as happiness or flourishing). (See Annas 2011 for\na short, clear, and authoritative account of all three.) We discuss\nthe first two in the remainder of this section. Eudaimonia is\ndiscussed in connection with eudaimonist versions of virtue ethics in\nthe next.  \nA virtue is an excellent trait of character. It is a disposition, well\nentrenched in its possessor—something that, as we say, goes all\nthe way down, unlike a habit such as being a tea-drinker—to\nnotice, expect, value, feel, desire, choose, act, and react in certain\ncharacteristic ways. To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of\nperson with a certain complex mindset. A significant aspect of this\nmindset is the wholehearted acceptance of a distinctive range of\nconsiderations as reasons for action. An honest person cannot be\nidentified simply as one who, for example, practices honest dealing\nand does not cheat. If such actions are done merely because the agent\nthinks that honesty is the best policy, or because they fear being\ncaught out, rather than through recognising “To do otherwise\nwould be dishonest” as the relevant reason, they are not the\nactions of an honest person. An honest person cannot be identified\nsimply as one who, for example, tells the truth because it is\nthe truth, for one can have the virtue of honesty without being\ntactless or indiscreet. The honest person recognises “That would\nbe a lie” as a strong (though perhaps not overriding) reason for\nnot making certain statements in certain circumstances, and gives due,\nbut not overriding, weight to “That would be the truth” as\na reason for making them.  \nAn honest person’s reasons and choices with respect to honest\nand dishonest actions reflect her views about honesty, truth, and\ndeception—but of course such views manifest themselves with\nrespect to other actions, and to emotional reactions as well. Valuing\nhonesty as she does, she chooses, where possible to work with honest\npeople, to have honest friends, to bring up her children to be honest.\nShe disapproves of, dislikes, deplores dishonesty, is not amused by\ncertain tales of chicanery, despises or pities those who succeed\nthrough deception rather than thinking they have been clever, is\nunsurprised, or pleased (as appropriate) when honesty triumphs, is\nshocked or distressed when those near and dear to her do what is\ndishonest and so on. Given that a virtue is such a multi-track\ndisposition, it would obviously be reckless to attribute one to an\nagent on the basis of a single observed action or even a series of\nsimilar actions, especially if you don’t know the agent’s\nreasons for doing as she did (Sreenivasan 2002). \nPossessing a virtue is a matter of degree. To possess such a\ndisposition fully is to possess full or perfect virtue, which is rare,\nand there are a number of ways of falling short of this ideal\n(Athanassoulis 2000). Most people who can truly be described as fairly\nvirtuous, and certainly markedly better than those who can truly be\ndescribed as dishonest, self-centred and greedy, still have their\nblind spots—little areas where they do not act for the reasons\none would expect. So someone honest or kind in most situations, and\nnotably so in demanding ones, may nevertheless be trivially tainted by\nsnobbery, inclined to be disingenuous about their forebears and less\nthan kind to strangers with the wrong accent. \nFurther, it is not easy to get one’s emotions in harmony with\none’s rational recognition of certain reasons for action. I may\nbe honest enough to recognise that I must own up to a mistake because\nit would be dishonest not to do so without my acceptance being so\nwholehearted that I can own up easily, with no inner conflict.\nFollowing (and adapting) Aristotle, virtue ethicists draw a\ndistinction between full or perfect virtue and\n“continence”, or strength of will. The fully virtuous do\nwhat they should without a struggle against contrary desires; the\ncontinent have to control a desire or temptation to do otherwise. \nDescribing the continent as “falling short” of perfect\nvirtue appears to go against the intuition that there is something\nparticularly admirable about people who manage to act well when it is\nespecially hard for them to do so, but the plausibility of this\ndepends on exactly what “makes it hard” (Foot 1978:\n11–14). If it is the circumstances in which the agent\nacts—say that she is very poor when she sees someone drop a full\npurse or that she is in deep grief when someone visits seeking\nhelp—then indeed it is particularly admirable of her to restore\nthe purse or give the help when it is hard for her to do so. But if\nwhat makes it hard is an imperfection in her character—the\ntemptation to keep what is not hers, or a callous indifference to the\nsuffering of others—then it is not.  \nAnother way in which one can easily fall short of full virtue is\nthrough lacking phronesis—moral or practical\nwisdom. \nThe concept of a virtue is the concept of something that makes its\npossessor good: a virtuous person is a morally good, excellent or\nadmirable person who acts and feels as she should. These are commonly\naccepted truisms. But it is equally common, in relation to particular\n(putative) examples of virtues to give these truisms up. We may say of\nsomeone that he is generous or honest “to a fault”. It is\ncommonly asserted that someone’s compassion might lead them to\nact wrongly, to tell a lie they should not have told, for example, in\ntheir desire to prevent someone else’s hurt feelings. It is also\nsaid that courage, in a desperado, enables him to do far more wicked\nthings than he would have been able to do if he were timid. So it\nwould appear that generosity, honesty, compassion and courage despite\nbeing virtues, are sometimes faults. Someone who is generous, honest,\ncompassionate, and courageous might not be a morally good\nperson—or, if it is still held to be a truism that they are,\nthen morally good people may be led by what makes them morally good to\nact wrongly! How have we arrived at such an odd conclusion? \nThe answer lies in too ready an acceptance of ordinary usage, which\npermits a fairly wide-ranging application of many of the virtue terms,\ncombined, perhaps, with a modern readiness to suppose that the\nvirtuous agent is motivated by emotion or inclination, not by rational\nchoice. If one thinks of generosity or honesty as the\ndisposition to be moved to action by generous or honest impulses such\nas the desire to give or to speak the truth, if one thinks of\ncompassion as the disposition to be moved by the sufferings of others\nand to act on that emotion, if one thinks of courage as mere\nfearlessness or the willingness to face danger, then it will indeed\nseem obvious that these are all dispositions that can lead to their\npossessor’s acting wrongly. But it is also obvious, as soon as\nit is stated, that these are dispositions that can be possessed by\nchildren, and although children thus endowed (bar the\n“courageous” disposition) would undoubtedly be very nice\nchildren, we would not say that they were morally virtuous or\nadmirable people. The ordinary usage, or the reliance on motivation by\ninclination, gives us what Aristotle calls “natural\nvirtue”—a proto version of full virtue awaiting perfection\nby phronesis or practical wisdom. \nAristotle makes a number of specific remarks about phronesis\nthat are the subject of much scholarly debate, but the (related)\nmodern concept is best understood by thinking of what the virtuous\nmorally mature adult has that nice children, including nice\nadolescents, lack. Both the virtuous adult and the nice child have\ngood intentions, but the child is much more prone to mess things up\nbecause he is ignorant of what he needs to know in order to do what he\nintends. A virtuous adult is not, of course, infallible and may also,\non occasion, fail to do what she intended to do through lack of\nknowledge, but only on those occasions on which the lack of knowledge\nis not culpable. So, for example, children and adolescents often harm\nthose they intend to benefit either because they do not know how to\nset about securing the benefit or because their understanding of what\nis beneficial and harmful is limited and often mistaken. Such\nignorance in small children is rarely, if ever culpable. Adults, on\nthe other hand, are culpable if they mess things up by being\nthoughtless, insensitive, reckless, impulsive, shortsighted, and by\nassuming that what suits them will suit everyone instead of taking a\nmore objective viewpoint. They are also culpable if their\nunderstanding of what is beneficial and harmful is mistaken. It is\npart of practical wisdom to know how to secure real benefits\neffectively; those who have practical wisdom will not make the mistake\nof concealing the hurtful truth from the person who really needs to\nknow it in the belief that they are benefiting him. \nQuite generally, given that good intentions are intentions to act well\nor “do the right thing”, we may say that practical wisdom\nis the knowledge or understanding that enables its possessor, unlike\nthe nice adolescents, to do just that, in any given situation. The\ndetailed specification of what is involved in such knowledge or\nunderstanding has not yet appeared in the literature, but some aspects\nof it are becoming well known. Even many deontologists now stress the\npoint that their action-guiding rules cannot, reliably, be applied\nwithout practical wisdom, because correct application requires\nsituational appreciation—the capacity to recognise, in any\nparticular situation, those features of it that are morally salient.\nThis brings out two aspects of practical wisdom. \nOne is that it characteristically comes only with experience of life.\nAmongst the morally relevant features of a situation may be the likely\nconsequences, for the people involved, of a certain action, and this\nis something that adolescents are notoriously clueless about precisely\nbecause they are inexperienced. It is part of practical wisdom to be\nwise about human beings and human life. (It should go without saying\nthat the virtuous are mindful of the consequences of possible actions.\nHow could they fail to be reckless, thoughtless and short-sighted if\nthey were not?) \nThe second is the practically wise agent’s capacity to recognise\nsome features of a situation as more important than others, or indeed,\nin that situation, as the only relevant ones. The wise do not see\nthings in the same way as the nice adolescents who, with their\nunder-developed virtues, still tend to see the personally\ndisadvantageous nature of a certain action as competing in importance\nwith its honesty or benevolence or justice.  \nThese aspects coalesce in the description of the practically wise as\nthose who understand what is truly worthwhile, truly important, and\nthereby truly advantageous in life, who know, in short, how to live\nwell.  \nWhile all forms of virtue ethics agree that virtue is central and\npractical wisdom required, they differ in how they combine these and\nother concepts to illuminate what we should do in particular contexts\nand how we should live our lives as a whole. In what follows we sketch\nfour distinct forms taken by contemporary virtue ethics, namely, a)\neudaimonist virtue ethics, b) agent-based and exemplarist virtue\nethics, c) target-centered virtue ethics, and d) Platonistic virtue\nethics. \nThe distinctive feature of eudaimonist versions of virtue ethics is\nthat they define virtues in terms of their relationship to\neudaimonia. A virtue is a trait that contributes to or is a\nconstituent of eudaimonia and we ought to develop virtues,\nthe eudaimonist claims, precisely because they contribute to\neudaimonia. \nThe concept of eudaimonia, a key term in ancient Greek moral\nphilosophy, is standardly translated as “happiness” or\n“flourishing” and occasionally as\n“well-being.” Each translation has its disadvantages. The\ntrouble with “flourishing” is that animals and even plants\ncan flourish but eudaimonia is possible only for rational\nbeings. The trouble with “happiness” is that in ordinary\nconversation it connotes something subjectively determined. It is for\nme, not for you, to pronounce on whether I am happy. If I think I am\nhappy then I am—it is not something I can be wrong about\n(barring advanced cases of self-deception). Contrast my being healthy\nor flourishing. Here we have no difficulty in recognizing that I might\nthink I was healthy, either physically or psychologically, or think\nthat I was flourishing but be wrong. In this respect,\n“flourishing” is a better translation than\n“happiness”. It is all too easy to be mistaken about\nwhether one’s life is eudaimon (the adjective from\neudaimonia) not simply because it is easy to deceive oneself,\nbut because it is easy to have a mistaken conception of\neudaimonia, or of what it is to live well as a human being,\nbelieving it to consist largely in physical pleasure or luxury for\nexample. \nEudaimonia is, avowedly, a moralized or value-laden concept\nof happiness, something like “true” or “real”\nhappiness or “the sort of happiness worth seeking or\nhaving.” It is thereby the sort of concept about which there can\nbe substantial disagreement between people with different views about\nhuman life that cannot be resolved by appeal to some external standard\non which, despite their different views, the parties to the\ndisagreement concur (Hursthouse 1999: 188–189). \nMost versions of virtue ethics agree that living a life in accordance\nwith virtue is necessary for eudaimonia. This supreme good is\nnot conceived of as an independently defined state (made up of, say, a\nlist of non-moral goods that does not include virtuous activity) which\nexercise of the virtues might be thought to promote. It is, within\nvirtue ethics, already conceived of as something of which virtuous\nactivity is at least partially constitutive (Kraut 1989). Thereby\nvirtue ethicists claim that a human life devoted to physical pleasure\nor the acquisition of wealth is not eudaimon, but a wasted\nlife. \nBut although all standard versions of virtue ethics insist on that\nconceptual link between virtue and eudaimonia,\nfurther links are matters of dispute and generate different versions.\nFor Aristotle, virtue is necessary but not sufficient—what is\nalso needed are external goods which are a matter of luck. For Plato\nand the Stoics, virtue is both necessary and sufficient for\neudaimonia (Annas 1993). \nAccording to eudaimonist virtue ethics, the good life is the\neudaimon life, and the virtues are what enable a human being\nto be eudaimon because the virtues just are those character\ntraits that benefit their possessor in that way, barring bad luck. So\nthere is a link between eudaimonia and what confers virtue\nstatus on a character trait. (For a discussion of the differences\nbetween eudaimonists see Baril 2014. For recent defenses of\neudaimonism see Annas 2011; LeBar 2013b; Badhwar 2014; and Bloomfield\n2014.) \nRather than deriving the normativity of virtue from the value of\neudaimonia, agent-based virtue ethicists argue that other\nforms of normativity—including the value of\neudaimonia—are traced back to and ultimately explained\nin terms of the motivational and dispositional qualities of agents.\n \nIt is unclear how many other forms of normativity must be explained in\nterms of the qualities of agents in order for a theory to count as\nagent-based. The two best-known agent-based theorists, Michael Slote\nand Linda Zagzebski, trace a wide range of normative qualities back to\nthe qualities of agents. For example, Slote defines rightness and\nwrongness in terms of agents’ motivations: “[A]gent-based\nvirtue ethics … understands rightness in terms of good\nmotivations and wrongness in terms of the having of bad (or\ninsufficiently good) motives” (2001: 14). Similarly, he explains\nthe goodness of an action, the value of eudaimonia, the\njustice of a law or social institution, and the normativity of\npractical rationality in terms of the motivational and dispositional\nqualities of agents (2001: 99–100, 154, 2000). Zagzebski\nlikewise defines right and wrong actions by reference to the emotions,\nmotives, and dispositions of virtuous and vicious agents. For example,\n“A wrong act = an act that the phronimos\ncharacteristically would not do, and he would feel guilty if he did =\nan act such that it is not the case that he might do it = an act that\nexpresses a vice = an act that is against a requirement of virtue (the\nvirtuous self)” (Zagzebski 2004: 160). Her definitions of\nduties, good and bad ends, and good and bad states of affairs are\nsimilarly grounded in the motivational and dispositional states of\nexemplary agents (1998, 2004, 2010).  \nHowever, there could also be less ambitious agent-based approaches to\nvirtue ethics (see Slote 1997). At the very least, an agent-based\napproach must be committed to explaining what one should do by\nreference to the motivational and dispositional states of agents. But\nthis is not yet a sufficient condition for counting as an agent-based\napproach, since the same condition will be met by every\nvirtue ethical account. For a theory to count as an agent-based form\nof virtue ethics it must also be the case that the normative\nproperties of motivations and dispositions cannot be explained in\nterms of the normative properties of something else (such as\neudaimonia or states of affairs) which is taken to be more\nfundamental.  \nBeyond this basic commitment, there is room for agent-based theories\nto be developed in a number of different directions. The most\nimportant distinguishing factor has to do with how motivations and\ndispositions are taken to matter for the purposes of explaining other\nnormative qualities. For Slote what matters are this particular\nagent’s actual motives and dispositions. The goodness of\naction A, for example, is derived from the agent’s motives when\nshe performs A. If those motives are good then the action is good, if\nnot then not. On Zagzebski’s account, by contrast, a good or\nbad, right or wrong action is defined not by this agent’s actual\nmotives but rather by whether this is the sort of action a virtuously\nmotivated agent would perform (Zagzebski 2004: 160). Appeal to the\nvirtuous agent’s hypothetical motives and dispositions\nenables Zagzebski to distinguish between performing the right action\nand doing so for the right reasons (a distinction that, as Brady\n(2004) observes, Slote has trouble drawing). \nAnother point on which agent-based forms of virtue ethics might differ\nconcerns how one identifies virtuous motivations and dispositions.\nAccording to Zagzebski’s exemplarist account, “We do not\nhave criteria for goodness in advance of identifying the exemplars of\ngoodness” (Zagzebski 2004: 41). As we observe the people around\nus, we find ourselves wanting to be like some of them (in at least\nsome respects) and not wanting to be like others. The former provide\nus with positive exemplars and the latter with negative ones. Our\nunderstanding of better and worse motivations and virtuous and vicious\ndispositions is grounded in these primitive responses to exemplars\n(2004: 53). This is not to say that every time we act we stop and ask\nourselves what one of our exemplars would do in this situations. Our\nmoral concepts become more refined over time as we encounter a wider\nvariety of exemplars and begin to draw systematic connections between\nthem, noting what they have in common, how they differ, and which of\nthese commonalities and differences matter, morally speaking.\nRecognizable motivational profiles emerge and come to be labeled as\nvirtues or vices, and these, in turn, shape our understanding of the\nobligations we have and the ends we should pursue. However, even\nthough the systematising of moral thought can travel a long way from\nour starting point, according to the exemplarist it never reaches a\nstage where reference to exemplars is replaced by the recognition of\nsomething more fundamental. At the end of the day, according to the\nexemplarist, our moral system still rests on our basic propensity to\ntake a liking (or disliking) to exemplars. Nevertheless, one could be\nan agent-based theorist without advancing the exemplarist’s\naccount of the origins or reference conditions for judgments of good\nand bad, virtuous and vicious. \nThe touchstone for eudaimonist virtue ethicists is a flourishing human\nlife. For agent-based virtue ethicists it is an exemplary\nagent’s motivations. The target-centered view developed by\nChristine Swanton (2003), by contrast, begins with our existing\nconceptions of the virtues. We already have a passable idea of which\ntraits are virtues and what they involve. Of course, this untutored\nunderstanding can be clarified and improved, and it is one of the\ntasks of the virtue ethicist to help us do precisely that. But rather\nthan stripping things back to something as basic as the motivations we\nwant to imitate or building it up to something as elaborate as an\nentire flourishing life, the target-centered view begins where most\nethics students find themselves, namely, with the idea that\ngenerosity, courage, self-discipline, compassion, and the like get a\ntick of approval. It then examines what these traits involve. \nA complete account of virtue will map out 1) its field, 2)\nits mode of responsiveness, 3) its basis of moral\nacknowledgment, and 4) its target. Different virtues are\nconcerned with different fields. Courage, for example, is\nconcerned with what might harm us, whereas generosity is concerned\nwith the sharing of time, talent, and property. The basis of\nacknowledgment of a virtue is the feature within the virtue’s\nfield to which it responds. To continue with our previous examples,\ngenerosity is attentive to the benefits that others might enjoy\nthrough one’s agency, and courage responds to threats to value,\nstatus, or the bonds that exist between oneself and particular others,\nand the fear such threats might generate. A virtue’s\nmode has to do with how it responds to the bases of\nacknowledgment within its field. Generosity promotes a good,\nnamely, another’s benefit, whereas courage defends a\nvalue, bond, or status. Finally, a virtue’s target is\nthat at which it is aimed. Courage aims to control fear and handle\ndanger, while generosity aims to share time, talents, or possessions\nwith others in ways that benefit them. \nA virtue, on a target-centered account, “is a\ndisposition to respond to, or acknowledge, items within its field or\nfields in an excellent or good enough way” (Swanton 2003: 19). A\nvirtuous act is an act that hits the target of a virtue,\nwhich is to say that it succeeds in responding to items in its field\nin the specified way (233). Providing a target-centered definition of\na right action requires us to move beyond the analysis of a\nsingle virtue and the actions that follow from it. This is because a\nsingle action context may involve a number of different, overlapping\nfields. Determination might lead me to persist in trying to complete a\ndifficult task even if doing so requires a singleness of purpose. But\nlove for my family might make a different use of my time and\nattention. In order to define right action a target-centered view must\nexplain how we handle different virtues’ conflicting claims on\nour resources. There are at least three different ways to address this\nchallenge. A perfectionist target-centered account would\nstipulate, “An act is right if and only if it is overall\nvirtuous, and that entails that it is the, or a, best action possible\nin the circumstances” (239–240). A more\npermissive target-centered account would not identify\n‘right’ with ‘best’, but would allow an action\nto count as right provided “it is good enough even if not the\n(or a) best action” (240). A minimalist target-centered\naccount would not even require an action to be good in order to be\nright. On such a view, “An act is right if and only if it is not\noverall vicious” (240). (For further discussion of\ntarget-centered virtue ethics see Van Zyl 2014; and Smith 2016). \nThe fourth form a virtue ethic might adopt takes its inspiration from\nPlato. The Socrates of Plato’s dialogues devotes a great deal of\ntime to asking his fellow Athenians to explain the nature of virtues\nlike justice, courage, piety, and wisdom. So it is clear that Plato\ncounts as a virtue theorist. But it is a matter of some debate whether\nhe should be read as a virtue ethicist (White 2015). What is not open\nto debate is whether Plato has had an important influence on the\ncontemporary revival of interest in virtue ethics. A number of those\nwho have contributed to the revival have done so as Plato scholars\n(e.g., Prior 1991; Kamtekar 1998; Annas 1999; and Reshotko 2006).\nHowever, often they have ended up championing a eudaimonist version of\nvirtue ethics (see Prior 2001 and Annas 2011), rather than a version\nthat would warrant a separate classification. Nevertheless, there are\ntwo variants that call for distinct treatment. \nTimothy Chappell takes the defining feature of Platonistic virtue\nethics to be that “Good agency in the truest and fullest sense\npresupposes the contemplation of the Form of the Good” (2014).\nChappell follows Iris Murdoch in arguing that “In the moral life\nthe enemy is the fat relentless ego” (Murdoch 1971: 51).\nConstantly attending to our needs, our desires, our passions, and our\nthoughts skews our perspective on what the world is actually like and\nblinds us to the goods around us. Contemplating the goodness of\nsomething we encounter—which is to say, carefully attending to\nit “for its own sake, in order to understand it” (Chappell\n2014: 300)—breaks this natural tendency by drawing our attention\naway from ourselves. Contemplating such goodness with regularity makes\nroom for new habits of thought that focus more readily and more\nhonestly on things other than the self. It alters the quality of our\nconsciousness. And “anything which alters consciousness in the\ndirection of unselfishness, objectivity, and realism is to be\nconnected with virtue” (Murdoch 1971: 82). The virtues get\ndefined, then, in terms of qualities that help one “pierce the\nveil of selfish consciousness and join the world as it really\nis” (91). And good agency is defined by the possession and\nexercise of such virtues. Within Chappell’s and Murdoch’s\nframework, then, not all normative properties get defined in terms of\nvirtue. Goodness, in particular, is not so defined. But the kind of\ngoodness which is possible for creatures like us is defined by virtue,\nand any answer to the question of what one should do or how one should\nlive will appeal to the virtues. \nAnother Platonistic variant of virtue ethics is exemplified by Robert\nMerrihew Adams. Unlike Murdoch and Chappell, his starting point is not\na set of claims about our consciousness of goodness. Rather, he begins\nwith an account of the metaphysics of goodness. Like Murdoch and\nothers influenced by Platonism, Adams’s account of goodness is\nbuilt around a conception of a supremely perfect good. And like\nAugustine, Adams takes that perfect good to be God. God is both the\nexemplification and the source of all goodness. Other things are good,\nhe suggests, to the extent that they resemble God (Adams 1999). \nThe resemblance requirement identifies a necessary condition for being\ngood, but it does not yet give us a sufficient condition. This is\nbecause there are ways in which finite creatures might resemble God\nthat would not be suitable to the type of creature they are. For\nexample, if God were all-knowing, then the belief, “I am\nall-knowing,” would be a suitable belief for God to have. In\nGod, such a belief—because true—would be part of\nGod’s perfection. However, as neither you nor I are all-knowing,\nthe belief, “I am all-knowing,” in one of us would not be\ngood. To rule out such cases we need to introduce another factor. That\nfactor is the fitting response to goodness, which Adams suggests is\nlove. Adams uses love to weed out problematic resemblances:\n“being excellent in the way that a finite thing can be consists\nin resembling God in a way that could serve God as a reason for loving\nthe thing” (Adams 1999: 36). \nVirtues come into the account as one of the ways in which some things\n(namely, persons) could resemble God. “[M]ost of the excellences\nthat are most important to us, and of whose value we are most\nconfident, are excellences of persons or of qualities or actions or\nworks or lives or stories of persons” (1999: 42). This is one of\nthe reasons Adams offers for conceiving of the ideal of perfection as\na personal God, rather than an impersonal form of the Good. Many of\nthe excellences of persons of which we are most confident are virtues\nsuch as love, wisdom, justice, patience, and generosity. And within\nmany theistic traditions, including Adams’s own Christian\ntradition, such virtues are commonly attributed to divine agents. \nA Platonistic account like the one Adams puts forward in Finite\nand Infinite Goods clearly does not derive all other normative\nproperties from the virtues (for a discussion of the relationship\nbetween this view and the one he puts forward in A Theory of\nVirtue (2006) see Pettigrove 2014). Goodness provides the\nnormative foundation. Virtues are not built on that foundation;\nrather, as one of the varieties of goodness of whose value we are most\nconfident, virtues form part of the foundation. Obligations, by\ncontrast, come into the account at a different level. Moral\nobligations, Adams argues, are determined by the expectations and\ndemands that “arise in a relationship or system of relationships\nthat is good or valuable” (1999: 244). Other things being equal,\nthe more virtuous the parties to the relationship, the more binding\nthe obligation. Thus, within Adams’s account, the good (which\nincludes virtue) is prior to the right. However, once good\nrelationships have given rise to obligations, those obligations take\non a life of their own. Their bindingness is not traced directly to\nconsiderations of goodness. Rather, they are determined by the\nexpectations of the parties and the demands of the relationship. \nA number of objections have been raised against virtue ethics, some of\nwhich bear more directly on one form of virtue ethics than on others.\nIn this section we consider eight objections, namely, the a)\napplication, b) adequacy, c) relativism, d) conflict, e)\nself-effacement, f) justification, g) egoism, and h) situationist\nproblems.  \na) In the early days of virtue ethics’ revival, the approach was\nassociated with an “anti-codifiability” thesis about\nethics, directed against the prevailing pretensions of normative\ntheory. At the time, utilitarians and deontologists commonly (though\nnot universally) held that the task of ethical theory was to come up\nwith a code consisting of universal rules or principles (possibly only\none, as in the case of act-utilitarianism) which would have two\nsignificant features: i) the rule(s) would amount to a decision\nprocedure for determining what the right action was in any particular\ncase; ii) the rule(s) would be stated in such terms that any\nnon-virtuous person could understand and apply it (them) correctly.\n \nVirtue ethicists maintained, contrary to these two claims, that it was\nquite unrealistic to imagine that there could be such a code (see, in\nparticular, McDowell 1979). The results of attempts to produce and\nemploy such a code, in the heady days of the 1960s and 1970s, when\nmedical and then bioethics boomed and bloomed, tended to support the\nvirtue ethicists’ claim. More and more utilitarians and\ndeontologists found themselves agreed on their general rules but on\nopposite sides of the controversial moral issues in contemporary\ndiscussion. It came to be recognised that moral sensitivity,\nperception, imagination, and judgement informed by\nexperience—phronesis in short—is needed to apply\nrules or principles correctly. Hence many (though by no means all)\nutilitarians and deontologists have explicitly abandoned (ii) and much\nless emphasis is placed on (i). \nNevertheless, the complaint that virtue ethics does not produce\ncodifiable principles is still a commonly voiced criticism of the\napproach, expressed as the objection that it is, in principle, unable\nto provide action-guidance. \nInitially, the objection was based on a misunderstanding. Blinkered by\nslogans that described virtue ethics as “concerned with Being\nrather than Doing”, as addressing “What sort of person\nshould I be?” but not “What should I do?” as being\n“agent-centered rather than act-centered”, its critics\nmaintained that it was unable to provide action-guidance and hence,\nrather than being a normative rival to utilitarian and deontological\nethics, could claim to be no more than a valuable supplement to them.\nThe rather odd idea was that all virtue ethics could offer was\n“Identify a moral exemplar and do what he would do” as\nthough the raped fifteen-year-old trying to decide whether or not to\nhave an abortion was supposed to ask herself “Would Socrates\nhave had an abortion if he were in my circumstances?” \nBut the objection failed to take note of Anscombe’s hint that a\ngreat deal of specific action guidance could be found in rules\nemploying the virtue and vice terms (“v-rules”) such as\n“Do what is honest/charitable; do not do what is\ndishonest/uncharitable” (Hursthouse 1999). (It is a noteworthy\nfeature of our virtue and vice vocabulary that, although our list of\ngenerally recognised virtue terms is comparatively short, our list of\nvice terms is remarkably, and usefully, long, far exceeding anything\nthat anyone who thinks in terms of standard deontological rules has\never come up with. Much invaluable action guidance comes from avoiding\ncourses of action that would be irresponsible, feckless, lazy,\ninconsiderate, uncooperative, harsh, intolerant, selfish, mercenary,\nindiscreet, tactless, arrogant, unsympathetic, cold, incautious,\nunenterprising, pusillanimous, feeble, presumptuous, rude,\nhypocritical, self-indulgent, materialistic, grasping, short-sighted,\nvindictive, calculating, ungrateful, grudging, brutal, profligate,\ndisloyal, and on and on.) \n(b) A closely related objection has to do with whether virtue ethics\ncan provide an adequate account of right action. This worry can take\ntwo forms. (i) One might think a virtue ethical account of right\naction is extensionally inadequate. It is possible to perform a right\naction without being virtuous and a virtuous person can occasionally\nperform the wrong action without that calling her virtue into\nquestion. If virtue is neither necessary nor sufficient for right\naction, one might wonder whether the relationship between\nrightness/wrongness and virtue/vice is close enough for the former to\nbe identified in terms of the latter. (ii) Alternatively, even if one\nthought it possible to produce a virtue ethical account that picked\nout all (and only) right actions, one might still think that at least\nin some cases virtue is not what explains rightness (Adams\n2006:6–8). \nSome virtue ethicists respond to the adequacy objection by rejecting\nthe assumption that virtue ethics ought to be in the business of\nproviding an account of right action in the first place. Following in\nthe footsteps of Anscombe (1958) and MacIntyre (1985), Talbot Brewer\n(2009) argues that to work with the categories of rightness and\nwrongness is already to get off on the wrong foot. Contemporary\nconceptions of right and wrong action, built as they are around a\nnotion of moral duty that presupposes a framework of divine (or moral)\nlaw or around a conception of obligation that is defined in contrast\nto self-interest, carry baggage the virtue ethicist is better off\nwithout. Virtue ethics can address the questions of how one should\nlive, what kind of person one should become, and even what one should\ndo without that committing it to providing an account of ‘right\naction’. One might choose, instead, to work with aretaic\nconcepts (defined in terms of virtues and vices) and axiological\nconcepts (defined in terms of good and bad, better and worse) and\nleave out deontic notions (like right/wrong action, duty, and\nobligation) altogether. \nOther virtue ethicists wish to retain the concept of right action but\nnote that in the current philosophical discussion a number of distinct\nqualities march under that banner. In some contexts, ‘right\naction’ identifies the best action an agent might perform in the\ncircumstances. In others, it designates an action that is commendable\n(even if not the best possible). In still others, it picks out actions\nthat are not blameworthy (even if not commendable). A virtue ethicist\nmight choose to define one of these—for example, the best\naction—in terms of virtues and vices, but appeal to other\nnormative concepts—such as legitimate expectations—when\ndefining other conceptions of right action. \nAs we observed in section 2, a virtue ethical account need not attempt\nto reduce all other normative concepts to virtues and vices.\nWhat is required is simply (i) that virtue is not reduced to\nsome other normative concept that is taken to be more fundamental and\n(ii) that some other normative concepts are explained in\nterms of virtue and vice. This takes the sting out of the adequacy\nobjection, which is most compelling against versions of virtue ethics\nthat attempt to define all of the senses of ‘right action’\nin terms of virtues. Appealing to virtues and vices makes it\nmuch easier to achieve extensional adequacy. Making room for normative\nconcepts that are not taken to be reducible to virtue and vice\nconcepts makes it even easier to generate a theory that is both\nextensionally and explanatorily adequate. Whether one needs other\nconcepts and, if so, how many, is still a matter of debate among\nvirtue ethicists, as is the question of whether virtue ethics even\nought to be offering an account of right action. Either way virtue\nethicists have resources available to them to address the adequacy\nobjection. \nInsofar as the different versions of virtue ethics all retain an\nemphasis on the virtues, they are open to the familiar problem of (c)\nthe charge of cultural relativity. Is it not the case that different\ncultures embody different virtues, (MacIntyre 1985) and hence that the\nv-rules will pick out actions as right or wrong only relative to a\nparticular culture? Different replies have been made to this charge.\nOne—the tu quoque, or “partners in crime”\nresponse—exhibits a quite familiar pattern in virtue\nethicists’ defensive strategy (Solomon 1988). They admit that,\nfor them, cultural relativism is a challenge, but point out\nthat it is just as much a problem for the other two approaches. The\n(putative) cultural variation in character traits regarded as virtues\nis no greater—indeed markedly less—than the cultural\nvariation in rules of conduct, and different cultures have different\nideas about what constitutes happiness or welfare. That cultural\nrelativity should be a problem common to all three approaches is\nhardly surprising. It is related, after all, to the\n“justification problem”\n (see below)\n the quite general metaethical problem of justifying one’s moral\nbeliefs to those who disagree, whether they be moral sceptics,\npluralists or from another culture. \nA bolder strategy involves claiming that virtue ethics has less\ndifficulty with cultural relativity than the other two approaches.\nMuch cultural disagreement arises, it may be claimed, from local\nunderstandings of the virtues, but the virtues themselves are not\nrelative to culture (Nussbaum 1993). \nAnother objection to which the tu quoque response is\npartially appropriate is (d) “the conflict problem.” What\ndoes virtue ethics have to say about dilemmas—cases in which,\napparently, the requirements of different virtues conflict because\nthey point in opposed directions? Charity prompts me to kill the\nperson who would be better off dead, but justice forbids it. Honesty\npoints to telling the hurtful truth, kindness and compassion to\nremaining silent or even lying. What shall I do? Of course, the same\nsorts of dilemmas are generated by conflicts between deontological\nrules. Deontology and virtue ethics share the conflict problem (and\nare happy to take it on board rather than follow some of the\nutilitarians in their consequentialist resolutions of such dilemmas)\nand in fact their strategies for responding to it are parallel. Both\naim to resolve a number of dilemmas by arguing that the conflict is\nmerely apparent; a discriminating understanding of the virtues or\nrules in question, possessed only by those with practical wisdom, will\nperceive that, in this particular case, the virtues do not make\nopposing demands or that one rule outranks another, or has a certain\nexception clause built into it. Whether this is all there is to it\ndepends on whether there are any irresolvable dilemmas. If there are,\nproponents of either normative approach may point out reasonably that\nit could only be a mistake to offer a resolution of what is, ex\nhypothesi, irresolvable. \nAnother problem arguably shared by all three approaches is (e), that\nof being self-effacing. An ethical theory is self-effacing if,\nroughly, whatever it claims justifies a particular action, or makes it\nright, had better not be the agent’s motive for doing it.\nMichael Stocker (1976) originally introduced it as a problem for\ndeontology and consequentialism. He pointed out that the agent who,\nrightly, visits a friend in hospital will rather lessen the impact of\nhis visit on her if he tells her either that he is doing it because it\nis his duty or because he thought it would maximize the general\nhappiness. But as Simon Keller observes, she won’t be any better\npleased if he tells her that he is visiting her because it is what a\nvirtuous agent would do, so virtue ethics would appear to have the\nproblem too (Keller 2007). However, virtue ethics’ defenders\nhave argued that not all forms of virtue ethics are subject to this\nobjection (Pettigrove 2011) and those that are are not seriously\nundermined by the problem (Martinez 2011). \nAnother problem for virtue ethics, which is shared by both\nutilitarianism and deontology, is (f)\n “the justification problem.”\n Abstractly conceived, this is the problem of how we justify or ground\nour ethical beliefs, an issue that is hotly debated at the level of\nmetaethics. In its particular versions, for deontology there is the\nquestion of how to justify its claims that certain moral rules are the\ncorrect ones, and for utilitarianism of how to justify its claim that\nall that really matters morally are consequences for happiness or\nwell-being. For virtue ethics, the problem concerns the question of\nwhich character traits are the virtues. \nIn the metaethical debate, there is widespread disagreement about the\npossibility of providing an external foundation for\nethics—“external” in the sense of being external to\nethical beliefs—and the same disagreement is found amongst\ndeontologists and utilitarians. Some believe that their normative\nethics can be placed on a secure basis, resistant to any form of\nscepticism, such as what anyone rationally desires, or would accept or\nagree on, regardless of their ethical outlook; others that it\ncannot. \nVirtue ethicists have eschewed any attempt to ground virtue ethics in\nan external foundation while continuing to maintain that their claims\ncan be validated. Some follow a form of Rawls’s coherentist\napproach (Slote 2001; Swanton 2003); neo-Aristotelians a form of\nethical naturalism. \nA misunderstanding of eudaimonia as an unmoralized concept\nleads some critics to suppose that the neo-Aristotelians are\nattempting to ground their claims in a scientific account of human\nnature and what counts, for a human being, as flourishing. Others\nassume that, if this is not what they are doing, they cannot be\nvalidating their claims that, for example, justice, charity, courage,\nand generosity are virtues. Either they are illegitimately helping\nthemselves to Aristotle’s discredited natural teleology\n(Williams 1985) or producing mere rationalizations of their own\npersonal or culturally inculcated values. But McDowell, Foot,\nMacIntyre and Hursthouse have all outlined versions of a third way\nbetween these two extremes. Eudaimonia in virtue ethics, is\nindeed a moralized concept, but it is not only that. Claims about what\nconstitutes flourishing for human beings no more float free of\nscientific facts about what human beings are like than ethological\nclaims about what constitutes flourishing for elephants. In both\ncases, the truth of the claims depends in part on what kind\nof animal they are and what capacities, desires and interests the\nhumans or elephants have. \nThe best available science today (including evolutionary theory and\npsychology) supports rather than undermines the ancient Greek\nassumption that we are social animals, like elephants and wolves and\nunlike polar bears. No rationalizing explanation in terms of anything\nlike a social contract is needed to explain why we choose to live\ntogether, subjugating our egoistic desires in order to secure the\nadvantages of co-operation. Like other social animals, our natural\nimpulses are not solely directed towards our own pleasures and\npreservation, but include altruistic and cooperative ones. \nThis basic fact about us should make more comprehensible the claim\nthat the virtues are at least partially constitutive of human\nflourishing and also undercut the objection that virtue ethics is, in\nsome sense, egoistic. \n(g) The egoism objection has a number of sources. One is a simple\nconfusion. Once it is understood that the fully virtuous agent\ncharacteristically does what she should without inner conflict, it is\ntriumphantly asserted that “she is only doing what she\nwants to do and hence is being selfish.” So when the\ngenerous person gives gladly, as the generous are wont to do, it turns\nout she is not generous and unselfish after all, or at least not as\ngenerous as the one who greedily wants to hang on to everything she\nhas but forces herself to give because she thinks she should! A\nrelated version ascribes bizarre reasons to the virtuous agent,\nunjustifiably assuming that she acts as she does because she\nbelieves that acting thus on this occasion will help her to achieve\neudaimonia. But “the virtuous agent” is just\n“the agent with the virtues” and it is part of our\nordinary understanding of the virtue terms that each carries with it\nits own typical range of reasons for acting. The virtuous agent acts\nas she does because she believes that someone’s suffering will\nbe averted, or someone benefited, or the truth established, or a debt\nrepaid, or … thereby. \nIt is the exercise of the virtues during one’s life that is held\nto be at least partially constitutive of eudaimonia, and this\nis consistent with recognising that bad luck may land the virtuous\nagent in circumstances that require her to give up her life. Given the\nsorts of considerations that courageous, honest, loyal, charitable\npeople wholeheartedly recognise as reasons for action, they may find\nthemselves compelled to face danger for a worthwhile end, to speak out\nin someone’s defence, or refuse to reveal the names of their\ncomrades, even when they know that this will inevitably lead to their\nexecution, to share their last crust and face starvation. On the view\nthat the exercise of the virtues is necessary but not sufficient for\neudaimonia, such cases are described as those in which the\nvirtuous agent sees that, as things have unfortunately turned out,\neudaimonia is not possible for them (Foot 2001, 95). On the\nStoical view that it is both necessary and sufficient, a\neudaimon life is a life that has been successfully lived\n(where “success” of course is not to be understood in a\nmaterialistic way) and such people die knowing not only that they have\nmade a success of their lives but that they have also brought their\nlives to a markedly successful completion. Either way, such heroic\nacts can hardly be regarded as egoistic. \nA lingering suggestion of egoism may be found in the misconceived\ndistinction between so-called “self-regarding” and\n“other-regarding” virtues. Those who have been insulated\nfrom the ancient tradition tend to regard justice and benevolence as\nreal virtues, which benefit others but not their possessor, and\nprudence, fortitude and providence (the virtue whose opposite is\n“improvidence” or being a spendthrift) as not real virtues\nat all because they benefit only their possessor. This is a mistake on\ntwo counts. Firstly, justice and benevolence do, in general, benefit\ntheir possessors, since without them eudaimonia is not\npossible. Secondly, given that we live together, as social animals,\nthe “self-regarding” virtues do benefit others—those\nwho lack them are a great drain on, and sometimes grief to, those who\nare close to them (as parents with improvident or imprudent adult\noffspring know only too well). \nThe most recent objection (h) to virtue ethics claims that work in\n“situationist” social psychology shows that there are no\nsuch things as character traits and thereby no such things as virtues\nfor virtue ethics to be about (Doris 1998; Harman 1999). In reply,\nsome virtue ethicists have argued that the social psychologists’\nstudies are irrelevant to the multi-track disposition (see above) that\na virtue is supposed to be (Sreenivasan 2002; Kamtekar 2004). Mindful\nof just how multi-track it is, they agree that it would be reckless in\nthe extreme to ascribe a demanding virtue such as charity to people of\nwhom they know no more than that they have exhibited conventional\ndecency; this would indeed be “a fundamental attribution\nerror.” Others have worked to develop alternative, empirically\ngrounded conceptions of character traits (Snow 2010; Miller 2013 and\n2014; however see Upton 2016 for objections to Miller). There have\nbeen other responses as well (summarized helpfully in Prinz 2009 and\nMiller 2014). Notable among these is a response by Adams (2006,\nechoing Merritt 2000) who steers a middle road between “no\ncharacter traits at all” and the exacting standard of the\nAristotelian conception of virtue which, because of its emphasis on\nphronesis, requires a high level of character integration. On his\nconception, character traits may be “frail and\nfragmentary” but still virtues, and not uncommon. But giving up\nthe idea that practical wisdom is the heart of all the virtues, as\nAdams has to do, is a substantial sacrifice, as Russell (2009) and\nKamtekar (2010) argue. \nEven though the “situationist challenge” has left\ntraditional virtue ethicists unmoved, it has generated a healthy\nengagement with empirical psychological literature, which has also\nbeen fuelled by the growing literature on Foot’s Natural\nGoodness and, quite independently, an upsurge of interest in\ncharacter education (see below). \nOver the past thirty-five years most of those contributing to the\nrevival of virtue ethics have worked within a neo-Aristotelian,\neudaimonist framework. However, as noted in section 2, other forms of\nvirtue ethics have begun to emerge. Theorists have begun to turn to\nphilosophers like Hutcheson, Hume, Nietzsche, Martineau, and Heidegger\nfor resources they might use to develop alternatives (see Russell\n2006; Swanton 2013 and 2015; Taylor 2015; and Harcourt 2015). Others\nhave turned their attention eastward, exploring Confucian, Buddhist,\nand Hindu traditions (Yu 2007; Slingerland 2011; Finnigan and Tanaka\n2011; McRae 2012; Angle and Slote 2013; Davis 2014; Flanagan 2015;\nPerrett and Pettigrove 2015; and Sim 2015). These explorations promise\nto open up new avenues for the development of virtue ethics. \nAlthough virtue ethics has grown remarkably in the last thirty-five\nyears, it is still very much in the minority, particularly in the area\nof applied ethics. Many editors of big textbook collections on\n“moral problems” or “applied ethics” now try\nto include articles representative of each of the three normative\napproaches but are often unable to find a virtue ethics article\naddressing a particular issue. This is sometimes, no doubt, because\n“the” issue has been set up as a\ndeontologicial/utilitarian debate, but it is often simply because no\nvirtue ethicist has yet written on the topic. However, the last decade\nhas seen an increase in the amount of attention applied virtue ethics\nhas received (Walker and Ivanhoe 2007; Hartman 2013; Austin 2014; Van\nHooft 2014; and Annas 2015). This area can certainly be expected to\ngrow in the future, and it looks as though applying virtue ethics in\nthe field of environmental ethics may prove particularly fruitful\n(Sandler 2007; Hursthouse 2007, 2011; Zwolinski and Schmidtz 2013;\nCafaro 2015). \nWhether virtue ethics can be expected to grow into “virtue\npolitics”—i.e. to extend from moral philosophy into\npolitical philosophy—is not so clear. Gisela Striker (2006) has\nargued that Aristotle’s ethics cannot be understood adequately\nwithout attending to its place in his politics. That suggests that at\nleast those virtue ethicists who take their inspiration from Aristotle\nshould have resources to offer for the development of virtue politics.\nBut, while Plato and Aristotle can be great inspirations as far as\nvirtue ethics is concerned, neither, on the face of it, are attractive\nsources of insight where politics is concerned. However, recent work\nsuggests that Aristotelian ideas can, after all, generate a\nsatisfyingly liberal political philosophy (Nussbaum 2006; LeBar\n2013a). Moreover, as noted above, virtue ethics does not have to be\nneo-Aristotelian. It may be that the virtue ethics of Hutcheson and\nHume can be naturally extended into a modern political philosophy\n(Hursthouse 1990–91; Slote 1993). \nFollowing Plato and Aristotle, modern virtue ethics has always\nemphasised the importance of moral education, not as the inculcation\nof rules but as the training of character. There is now a growing\nmovement towards virtues education, amongst both academics (Carr 1999;\nAthanassoulis 2014; Curren 2015) and teachers in the classroom. One\nexciting thing about research in this area is its engagement with\nother academic disciplines, including psychology, educational theory,\nand theology (see Cline 2015; and Snow 2015). \nFinally, one of the more productive developments of virtue ethics has\ncome through the study of particular virtues and vices. There are now\na number of careful studies of the cardinal virtues and capital vices\n(Pieper 1966; Taylor 2006; Curzer 2012; Timpe and Boyd 2014). Others\nhave explored less widely discussed virtues or vices, such as\ncivility, decency, truthfulness, ambition, and meekness (Calhoun 2000;\nKekes 2002; Williams 2002; and Pettigrove 2007 and 2012). One of the\nquestions these studies raise is “How many virtues are\nthere?” A second is, “How are these virtues related to one\nanother?” Some virtue ethicists have been happy to work on the\nassumption that there is no principled reason for limiting the number\nof virtues and plenty of reason for positing a plurality of them\n(Swanton 2003; Battaly 2015). Others have been concerned that such an\nopen-handed approach to the virtues will make it difficult for virtue\nethicists to come up with an adequate account of right action or deal\nwith the conflict problem discussed above. Dan Russell has proposed\ncardinality and a version of the unity thesis as a solution to what he\ncalls “the enumeration problem” (the problem of too many\nvirtues). The apparent proliferation of virtues can be significantly\nreduced if we group virtues together with some being cardinal and\nothers subordinate extensions of those cardinal virtues. Possible\nconflicts between the remaining virtues can then be managed if they\nare tied together in some way as part of a unified whole (Russell\n2009). This highlights two important avenues for future research, one\nof which explores individual virtues and the other of which analyses\nhow they might be related to one another.
