Singer","entry":"galen","body.text":"\n\n\nGalen (Galēnos, 129–c. 200 CE) was primarily a medical\nauthor, but had a deep engagement with and influence on the\nphilosophical debates of his time. He wrote many works of logic and\nethics, and also addressed those and other philosophical\nquestions—especially of epistemology, causation in the natural\nworld, and philosophy of mind—in his medical-scientific\nwritings. His medical, and in some contexts his philosophical, work\nhad enormous influence throughout the medieval period and even later,\nboth in Europe and (through Arabo-Islamic transmission) beyond.\nLargely ignored by the intellectual world, including philosophers,\nsince the Scientific Revolution, he has recently attracted\nconsiderable scholarly attention, especially for his work on\nscientific knowledge, his contribution to logic, and his discussions\nof ethics, moral psychology and the mind-body problem.\n\n\nGalen was one of the most prolific intellectuals of western antiquity,\nhis works extending to 21 volumes of roughly 1000 pages each in the\nstandard Greek edition (with a few additional works surviving only in\nArabic, Syriac, Hebrew or Latin translations)—a total of more\nthan 4 million words. While most of his scientific and medical\nwritings survive, many of his specialist works of philosophy do not.\nHe is an extremely adversarial author, a vigorous participant in the\nhighly rhetorical and learned competitive intellectual culture of\nsecond-century-CE Rome (the so-called “Second Sophistic”);\nand he is extremely prone to digression. He often expresses his own\nviews through the twin media of polemic against his opponents and\ntextual interpretation and commentary on his intellectual heroes\n(especially Plato and Hippocrates). And, in spite of his profound\nknowledge of the Greek philosophical tradition and\n“classic” philosophical texts and his engagement with\nphilosophical terminology and modes of argument, he does not define\nhimself as a philosopher, often expressing hostility towards\n“school” practitioners of philosophy.\n\n\nThe above very brief introduction to the study of “Galen the\nphilosopher” may also serve as a preliminary warning of the\npeculiar challenges that any such study faces: the vast body of texts,\nmany both diffuse in structure and unexamined by modern scholarship;\nthe wide range of genres (most not primarily philosophical),\ndialectical contexts and rhetorical arguments from which his\nphilosophical views must be reconstructed; his eclectic and\ndecontextualized use of philosophical terminology for his own\npurposes; certain specific losses amongst his specialist treatises of\nphilosophy.\n\nGalen was born into the intellectual and social elite of the\nculturally Greek city of Pergamon (near the northwest coast of Roman\nAsia, in present-day Turkey) in 129 CE, the son of an architect. He\nlays great stress on his own early education in mathematics and\ngeometry, and on his passion for logic (Lib. Prop. 14/11;\nAff. Pecc. Dig. I.8), seeing these disciplines as providing a\nmodel of secure proof lacking from the philosophical debates of the\npost-Hellenistic schools which were dominant in his day. From the age\nof fourteen, however, he also acquired a significant education in\nphilosophy. This involved attendance at the (closely text-based)\nlecture courses of professors of one or more of the four established\nphilosophical schools: Platonist, Aristotelian, Stoic, Epicurean;\nindeed, Galen mentions an adherent of each as part of his early\neducation. From the age of sixteen he also commenced his medical\nstudies, although study of philosophy continued concurrently. After\nhis father’s death in 149 he undertook an educational journey of\nseveral years, involving periods in Smyrna, Corinth and Alexandria, to\nstudy with the foremost medical teachers of the time. This study also\ninvolved a strong textual element, and—alongside actual anatomy\n(for which Alexandria remained a major centre, although dissection at\nthis period was restricted to non-human animals)—Galen acquired\nan in-depth knowledge of the medical, as well as the philosophical,\nwritings of his predecessors. \nIn 157 he returned to his home city, taking up an official post as\ndoctor to the gladiators, before moving to Rome in the early 160s,\nwhere—after one more brief period back in Pergamon—he\nsettled permanently. At Rome Galen seems to have developed his status\nvery quickly amongst the socio-intellectual elite—which\nsignificantly included devotees of philosophy, in particular\nAristotelians (Singer 2014). Galen quickly shone as a self-publicizing\nmedical practitioner; he also gave public lectures and anatomical\ndemonstrations in a highly competitive intellectual environment (see\nPraen.; Barton 1994; Mattern 2008; Von Staden 1995, 1997).\nMuch of his anatomical work, as well as the inception of two great\nworks central to the establishment of his reputation, The Function\nof the Parts of the Body (UP) and The Doctrines of\nHippocrates and Plato (PHP), belongs to this early\nperiod. The former text aims to establish the purposive, indeed\ndivine, construction, understood in relation to its particular\nfunction (chreia), of every anatomical feature of the body\n(see further\n section 5\n below), and explicitly models itself on Aristotelian biological work.\nThe latter constitutes both an exposition of Platonic tripartite\npsychology, with a vigorous polemic against the Stoic monist\nalternative, and a synthesis of this Platonic view with Galen’s\nphysiology of brain, heart and liver (see further below,\n section 7);\n it contains an account of the famous experiment whereby the function\nof the brain (in Galen’s terms, the fact that it is the seat of\nthe “leading-part” of the soul) is demonstrated by\nligation of the spinal cord of a live pig. \nAdopted as court physician by the emperor Marcus Aurelius (who ruled\n161–180), then co-reigning with Lucius Verus, Galen was also\nfortunate to be spared a lengthy military campaign with the two\nemperors in central Europe; to this period (169–76), indeed, he\nascribes the writing-up of a large number of his major works in\nscientific and medical theory.  \nGalen’s court career apparently continued through the reigns of\nMarcus’ successors, Commodus (180–92) and Septimius\nSeverus (193–211); this later phase of his career includes some\nof his major medical works, in particular: the magnum opus The\nMethod of Healing (MM); and much of his extremely\nvoluminous series of writings on drugs, and equally voluminous body of\ncommentaries on Hippocrates (together constituting nearly half his\nextant output). Galen lived through both Commodus’ notorious\nreign of terror and a disastrous fire, in 192, in which he lost a\nsubstantial personal library: both experiences are described in the\nrecently-discovered ethical work, Avoiding Distress\n(Ind.), which also adds to our knowledge of his extraordinary\nscholarly activity (including not least his work on the Aristotelian\ntradition). It is possible, but not certain, that Galen’s extant\nethical writings should also be dated to this later phase of his life\n(after 192). Towards the end of his life, certainly, he wrote a\n“philosophical testament”, My Own Doctrines\n(Prop. Plac.), which gives a concise but important insight\ninto his attitudes to a range of philosophical questions (see below,\n §3.4). \nGalen amassed a considerable fortune, including a second home in\nCampania; he must have had considerable intellectual influence on\nmedical life at Rome, although such influence is not attested until a\nconsiderably later period. The traditional date of his death is around\n200, but some later sources suggest that he was still alive more than\nten years after this. \nWe may identify three central roles of philosophy in Galen’s\nwork. One, to which he himself gives particular prominence, is the\ntheory of demonstration: this underlies explanations and accounts in\nthe natural world, enables the person trained in it to distinguish\nsecure from merely probable or downright fallacious arguments, and\nguarantees the reliability of propositions arrived at through its\ncorrect application. A second is that Galen’s scientific and\nmedical accounts themselves—of the theory of physical elements,\nfor example, or of causation and change—engage with existing\nphilosophical debates (e.g., between continuum theorists and atomists,\nor between teleologists and mechanists); and that he here relies\nstrongly on philosophical explanatory categories (e.g.,\ntelos, the form-matter distinction). Philosophical\ntechnical language and argumentation are also to the fore in\nspecifically medical realms, such as the theory of\nhealth or the classification of types of pulse: here too we find a\nconstant drive towards definition and linguistic disambiguation,\nhighly complex schemes of subdivision, and the employment of\nphilosophical vocabulary (e.g., ousia, eidos,\nsumbebēkos). \nThirdly, there are those areas of philosophy which are not of direct\nimportance to scientific or medical knowledge, but constitute separate\nintellectual domains, in which Galen nevertheless wishes to make a\ndistinctive contribution. Particularly relevant here is the domain of\nethics; one may regard some of his efforts in logic and linguistic\nstudies in the same light. \nThe area of “psychology” or philosophy of mind, meanwhile,\nin a sense comes under both the second and the third heading:\nGalen’s discussions of mind or soul (psychē) are\nsituated in a complex relationship both with the philosophical,\nespecially Platonic, tradition and with Galen’s medical and\nphysiological theories. \nThe role of philosophy in Galen will be better understood through a\nconsideration of the order of his own books which the author suggests\n(Lib. Prop. and in Ord. Lib. Prop.) to the aspiring\ndoctor: a sort of ideal curriculum of study which at the same time\nimplies an “order of knowledge”, a conceptual relationship\nbetween different intellectual areas. \nFirst comes demonstration. Knowledge of demonstration is necessary for\nreliable scientific knowledge and for the discernment of fallacious\narguments. But interestingly Galen here envisages two\npossible pathways for this first phase of the curriculum. For one who\naspires to true knowledge, a thorough understanding of Galen’s\nlogical magnum opus, Demonstration, is essential. But there\nis a more practical compromise: the less logically ambitious or adept\nmay—taking as his starting-point the “introductory”\nmethodological work, SI—proceed to the next stage\nwithout that thorough grounding. Some logical training is\nenvisaged here too; but Galen is interestingly optimistic about the\nability of the non-philosophical layperson to arrive at the truth on\nthe basis of common conceptions and a basic ability to follow\narguments (such ability being contrasted with the tendency of\nsectarian philosophers to create or succumb to sophistic fallacies);\nkey here is that the person in question should have acquired a solid\neducation in the traditional Greek “fundamentals”, which\ninvolved mathematics and logic. But this latter person\nwill—following a Platonic distinction—only be able to\naspire to correct opinion, not to secure knowledge. \nThe next stage is represented by anatomy, which is in turn followed by\nthe study of the function (chreia), capacities\n(dunameis) and activities of the parts which anatomy reveals.\nCapacities both “of nature” (phusikai) and\n“of the soul” (psuchikai) are considered here:\nthe important work Nat. Fac. is especially relevant to the\nformer, PHP and The Motion of Muscles (Mot. Musc.) to the\nlatter; study of UP should follow here too. \nGalen then proceeds—under the heading “necessary to read\nbefore the The Method of Healing”—to take a new\nstarting-point, in physical theory. Study of the fundamental elements\nof the cosmos and biological world (discussed in Hipp. Elem.)\nshould be followed by their study in the specifically animal, and\nhuman, context (in Temp.—a major and very influential\nwork of Galenic theory). From this point there is again a dual\npathway: the third book of Temp., with its discussion of the\nnature of change brought about by drugs, may lead into specialist\npharmacological study; alternatively, this may be bypassed in favour\nof a series of works on health and disease in the human body, which in\nturn lead into works on clinical practice, and on diagnostic and\nprognostic procedures. \nGalen thus envisages an intellectual progress from the study of the\nabstract and fundamental to the particular and individual, and\nrecommends that (at least ideally) a secure knowledge of demonstration\nshould underlie the whole paedagogic procedure. In clinical and\ndiagnostic/prognostic contexts, however, knowledge will be stochastic\nand “for the most part”, not secure and certain as in the context of the\npropositions provided by demonstrations. \nThere are then also works and areas of enquiry which stand outside\nthis curriculum, and which Galen lists under separate headings. Such,\nin particular, are the works of ethics; Galen lists more than 25, of\nwhich only two (Aff. Pecc. Dig. and Ind.) survive in\nfull, although PHP also contains much relevant material.\n(Some of the titles are tantalizing, in terms of what we have lost\nfrom Galen’s ethics: What Follows from Each Chosen Aim in\nLife; The Epicureans; Against Favorinus’\nAttack on Socrates.) \nAlso outside the main curriculum is a huge body of works on logic and\nlinguistic matters—again, nearly all lost. The titles testify to\nan exceptional engagement, not only with logical and methodological\nquestions, but also with specific texts of “the ancients”\nin logic: those of Aristotle and his school, especially, but also\nthose of the Stoics; and there were texts devoted to Plato’s\nargumentation. \nCentral to Galen’s notion of scientific knowledge and method is\nthe theory of demonstration. We shall therefore begin our discussion\nof Galen’s epistemology with a consideration of his theory and\npractice of demonstration, before proceeding to consider other aspects\nof his views on scientific method, and, finally, his views on the\nnature, limits and purpose of human knowledge more generally. \nWe shall best understand Galen’s notion of demonstration in\nrelation to scientific knowledge by considering some examples of what\nhe presents as demonstrative in actual argumentative contexts; but\nfirst let us consider the key theoretical features. (See Barnes 1991;\nHankinson 1991 and 2008a; Havrda 2015; Morison 2008; Tieleman 1996,\nCh. 1.) Galen believes that the highest-level, most reliable kind of\nknowledge (epistēmē) is arrived at through\n“scientific demonstration” (epistēmonikē\napodeixis). A key criterion for Galen is that the premisses\nemployed for a demonstration in relation to a subject, f, must\nbe “taken from the essence itself” of f (e.g.,\nPHP II.2, 108; Temp. II.2, 53). Here, the\nAristotelian term “essence” (ousia) is closely\nrelated to the notion of definition: the requirement is that when\nattempting a demonstration, any premiss one puts forward which\npurports to have general validity in relation to fs must be a\nproposition which relates to what fs in their fundamental\nnature or definition are, not one about fs’\nincidental features (let alone—a recurrent concern—one\nbased on some misunderstanding due to a homonymous usage of the term\n“f”). Further, the premisses for an\nepistēmonikē apodeixis must be propositions the truth of\nwhich is evident, either to reason or to sense-perception. \nFollowing Aristotelian logic, moreover, Galen is committed to the\nproject of presenting such demonstrations in syllogistic form. \nA central example of Galenic demonstration is the extended proof of\nthe location of the parts or principles of the soul, in PHP.\nThese are three: the rational (logistikon) or leading-part\n(hēgemonikon), located, Galen argues, in the brain; the\n“spirited” (thumoeides), located in the heart;\nand the desiderative (epithumētikon), located in the liver.\nGalen claims that the proof that the hēgemonikon resides in\nthe brain (and not, as in particular the Stoics think, the heart)\nadmits of scientific demonstration. \nIn a passage late in the work (VIII.1, 484–6), summing up its\ncentral argument, the demonstration is formulated in the following\nsyllogism: \nwhere the source of the nerves is, there is the hēgemonikon\n\nbut the source of the nerves is in the brain\n\nthe hēgemonikon, then, is in the brain.  \nThis formulation indicates not only Galen’s commitment to the\ndemonstrative-syllogistic method of presentation, but also some of its\nproblems. First, if we consider this syllogism in the light of the\nconceptual features outlined above, we would expect the first premiss\nto be, or to arise from, a proposition evident to reason; that is to\nsay, this premiss should be either self-evident or follow directly\nfrom the accepted nature, or definition, of hēgemonikon. The\nsecond premiss, then, contributes the results of some empirical\nobservation—something evident to sense-perception. The\nconclusion will follow inescapably from the conjunction of the two.\nBut can the first premiss here be regarded as definitional or analytic\nin the required sense? The nerves are not, surely, part of an accepted\ndefinition or common conception of what the hēgemonikon is\nin its very nature—or at least, could only become so after a\nconsiderable length of argument, itself involving empirical inputs and\nvarious forms of reasoning (for example from plausibility and from\nanalogy). Nor could one say, conversely, that the statement is evident\nto the senses: that would be to conflate a statement of empirical\ninformation with a statement derived in abstract terms from one of our\nfundamental conceptions (the nature of the hēgemonikon), as\nwell as to trespass on the domain of the second premiss in this\nparticular syllogism, for it is this that contains the result of the\nanatomical and physiological observations in animals. \nIn fact, Galen’s view of the definition, or fundamental\nconception, of the hēgemonikon is given much earlier in the\nwork: it is “the source of perception and of voluntary\nmotion” (PHP II.3, 110, also VII.1, 430). It is on this\nconception, which Galen takes to be universally agreed, even by his\nopponents, that the greater part of the argument against those\n(cardiocentric, monist) opponents and in favour of Galen’s\n(encephalocentric, tripartite) theory depends: cardiocentrism is shown\nto be wrong on the basis of that agreed conception. Thus,\nGalen’s demonstration in PHP proceeds largely by taking\nthe universally agreed conception of a term (hēgemonikon),\nand showing that a particular factual proposition about that\nterm—namely, that the hēgemonikon is in the\nbrain—follows from that conception, in conjunction with further\nevidence (partly empirical evidence, partly further agreed\nconceptions). The process of reasoning from that universally agreed\nperception to the cast-iron syllogism with which Galen presents us at\nthe culmination of the argument, however, is a complex one, much less\nclearly accessible to representation in formal logical terms. The\nrelative role of “starting-points taken directly from the\nousia of the subject” and empirical observations or\nfurther evidence seems much more complex than the theoretical\nsyllogistic framing of them would allow. \nThis point leads us to some further consideration of the nature of the\n“evident” starting-points. Allowing that Galen is\njustified in his reliance on empirical evidence, things evident to the\nsenses (see further below on his anti-Skeptical arguments), we still\nneed to analyse further what propositions may count as evident to\nreason. Relevant here is his own classification, already mentioned, of\ndifferent grades of argument on the basis of different kinds of\npremiss. In language indebted to Aristotle (in particular to his\nSophistical Refutations and Topics) and the\nAristotelian tradition, though in its precise formulation apparently\nunique to Galen, he lists four: epistemonic, dialectical, rhetorical\nand sophistic (PHP II.3, 110–12; II.8, 156–8).\nThis last type, which relies on ambiguity or linguistic confusion,\nneed not detain us further. The first type corresponds to the category\nwhich we have already considered, that of “proceeding directly\nfrom the ousia itself of the subject under enquiry”.\nDialectical premisses are ones which do not proceed thus directly\nfrom the ousia of the subject, but which may nonetheless be\nuseful for the training of the young, for refuting sophists, for\nleading to discoveries or for producing aporia. Rhetorical\npremisses derive from generally accepted (endoxa) or everyday\nexamples or inductions, or from the evidence of witnesses (which may\ninclude laypersons, poets or philosophers). \nMoreover, there are propositions which Galen firmly believes, and\nwhich indeed are central to his physiological system, which he does\nnot claim to be able to establish on the basis of epistemonic\npremisses; these “do not have such an evident\ndemonstration” as the former (PHP VI.3, 373; cf.\nVIII.1, 486–8), yet it seems in these cases that the lower-grade\ndemonstration is regarded as adequate. Such, in particular, are the\nproofs of the location of the remaining two parts of the soul, the\nspirited (in the heart) and the desiderative (in the liver). The proof\nof the location of the rational in the brain—which famously\ninvolves vivisectional experiments on animals, showing their loss of\nspeech and mobility when the spinal cord is ligated—Galen takes\nto be epistemonic. The propositions that the heart is in the seat of\nthe spirited, meanwhile, and that the liver is the seat of the\ndesiderative, rely on premisses which are not based directly on the\nousia of the subject, but rather (again using Aristotelian\nterminology), on its “specific properties”\n(sumbebēkota idiai). What this means in effect is that Galen\nmust here rely on proofs from plausibility and analogy: for example,\nthat the heart is the seat of the spirited part of the soul (related\nto responses of anger and indignation) gains plausibility from the\nfact that one observes perturbations of the heart in certain particular\nexcited states of mind; that the liver is the seat of the desiderative\n(which may be equated with the nutrititive and reproductive) is\nsupported by the proposition that it is the source of the veins, and\nthis proposition in turn relies on an analogy with plants: the bigger\n(trunk) is the source of the smaller (branches). \nYet how clear-cut is the distinction between the first and the second,\nor even between the first and the third, categories of premiss? To put\nit another way: might not a proposition which Galen defines as\nproceeding directly from the essence of the subject, that is to say,\npresumably, as evident to reason, from a different perspective be\ndefined as dialectical or indeed rhetorical? To take Galen’s\nclearest specific example in PHP, that the\nhēgemonikon is the source of perception and voluntary\nmotion, the only explicit grounds given for accepting it are\nthat it is accepted universally, even by Galen’s opponents\n(II.3, 110). This, one might think, would put it in the category of\nendoxon; or at least, it is difficult to see on what grounds\nGalen might be able to advance the distinction between endoxic\npropositions and irrefutably self-evident ones. To put it simply, at a\ncertain point arguments from consensus seem to be involved in the\njustification of propositions as “evident to reason”. \nThere are parallel problems for the role of demonstration in another\nimportant Galenic area, that of fundamental physical theory. Galen\nwishes to present his view as having been “demonstrated”,\nespecially by the text of Elements According to Hippocrates\n(Hipp. Elem.), and indeed the first part of that work is an\nattempt to establish a rigorous logical method for the foundation of\nthe theory. The problem is that this form of clear logical\nargumentation takes us only as far as the refutation of Atomism (as\nGalen understands it); that is, it is a proof of the plurality of\ntypes of fundamental component of the universe. When he moves from\nthat argument against Atomism/Monism, or for pluralism in general, to\nthe argument for the specific number and nature of the elements of his\nown theory, however, the argument is much less straightforward. Again,\nthat he takes his theory, at least in its essentials, to be not only\ntrue but deducible from evident facts and/or common conceptions, seems\nclear; but the precise nature and status of the arguments—and\nindeed of Galen’s claims for them, see further\n §3.4—are\n much less so. \nWe have considered Galen’s views on the establishment of secure\ntheoretical knowledge about the natural world. We turn to his views on\nscientific method in the more specifically medical context. Galen\nnames three medical “sects”, in relation to which he\npositions his own methodology: the Dogmatists or Rationalists\n(dogmatikoi, logikoi), the Empiricists\n(empeirikoi) and the Methodists (methodikoi); and he\nexplores the differences between them especially in SI. In\nfact, only the latter two names correspond to self-styled groupings\nwith explicit school doctrines; the term Rationalist or Dogmatist,\nmeanwhile, is a catch-all referring to any doctor who functions with a\n(non-Methodist) theory regarding the internal workings of the body.\n(See Walzer and Frede 1985, introduction; Hankinson 1991 and 2008a.)\nThe Methodists are a specific, theoretically minimalist sect, who\nconceptualize the pathology of the body in terms of two basic\n“commonalities” (koinotētes), consisting in\nincreased fluidity or increased restriction through the pathways\n(poroi) of the body; the Empiricists avoid any statement\nabout physiology, their treatments being based on an inductive\nprocedure (but with no theoretical commitment) from similarity with\npast cases, the “transition from the similar”\n(metabasis tou homoiou); a Dogmatist may be any\n(non-Methodist) physician with a theory about the internal workings of\nthe body and about disease aetiology. \nGalen’s greatest hostility is towards Methodists: their theory\nis simply wrong. The extremity of Galen’s reaction here seems in\npart related to their very simplicity. For Galen, medicine is a large\nand complex art requiring years of training in both logical and\nclinical disciplines; the Methodists (possibly a consciously\nanti-intellectual movement representing a non-elite group in society)\nprovocatively claimed that the art could be taught in six months;\ntheir minimalist theoretical framework hugely reduces the range of\nboth empirical inputs and theoretical distinctions that can be\nconsidered relevant. \nGalen believes that the Empiricist position, avoiding any statement\nabout unseen entities and basing itself entirely on experience\n(empeiria, peira), will lead to the correct\ntherapeutic result in many cases. Faced with a choice between being a\npure Empiricist and adopting an erroneous theory, one should\ninfinitely prefer the former. However, Galen’s view remains that\ntheoretical knowledge of the internal workings of the body is\npossible—that is, one can deduce facts about the non-evident\n(adēla) on the basis of one’s observations. Further,\nthis knowledge of the workings of the body, its phusis, gives\none an understanding of pathology—in particular, a\ndifferentiated pathology based on a knowledge of the different\ninternal parts and the different forms diseases may take in them, despite\nsuperficially similar symptoms—which will in some cases enable\none to make the right diagnosis, and therefore prescribe the correct\ntreatment, where the Empiricist would not. \nGalen is committed to the possibility of secure knowledge of the\nphysical world. In Opt. Doc., in response to contemporary\nGreek epistemological debates, he rejects Skeptical arguments that\nencourage us to doubt one’s natural evaluative faculty\n(kritērion), or to advance arguments on both sides of any\nargument in order to reach suspension of judgement; he also attacks\nthe Stoic terminology of the “apprehensive” or\n“kataleptic” (katalēptikē) impression, a kind\nof cognitive experience which is so clear as to be self-guaranteeing.\n(But he seems to regard the distinction between\n“kataleptic” and his preferred term, “securely\nknowable”, as purely verbal, rather than of philosophical\ninterest. Relatedly, he mentions, but does not seem to feel a serious\nphilosophical challenge from, the Skeptical objection that one may\nbelieve one has a reliable perception also in dreams or in mentally\nderanged states.) \nGalen is exercised to assert the reliability of one’s\nfundamental intuitions and sense-perceptions (what is trustworthy in\nitself, ex heautou pista), on the one hand, while giving an\nexplanation of human disagreement on matters of fact and theory, on\nthe other. His view is that while we are endowed with a naturally\nreliable evaluative faculty (kritērion), there is a right\nand a wrong way of training this; the former will, in particular,\nenable one to distinguish true from false arguments. (Training of the\nindividual faculties of sense perception—for example,\ntouch—is also of great importance, especially for the aspiring\ndoctor.) Galen uses an analogy with other specialist skills\n(technai): a music teacher or gymnastic trainer, equally,\nrelies on the pupil’s trust in his own natural\nkritērion, but this does not mean that performance will be\nerror-free. Rather, teaching in these contexts—as in that of\nlogical argument and knowledge acquisition—is a constant process\nof supervision and correction of errors. \nGalen also theorizes in an original way the relationship between\nempirical inputs and the conceptual framework within which they are\nassessed; in particular, with his concept of “qualified\nexperience” (diōrismenē peira; see van der Eijk 1997)\nhe asserts that empirical data can only lead to the truth in the\ncontext of a theoretical framework arrived at through reason. \nAbove, we considered the role of logical demonstration. We should\nconsider further the role of mathematics and geometry: Galen looks to\nthese as providing a model of the possibility of certain knowledge,\nand a refutation of Skepticism. He recommends a training in these\ndisciplines, where “the fact itself bears witness of its truth,\nonce discovered”—i.e., where one cannot doubt the\nrightness of the solution one has reached—for anyone interested\nin truth-giving enquiry (Aff. Pecc. Dig. II.3, 290–2;\nII.4–5, 299–305). A key example is that of the building of\na sundial: if one has done it correctly, the facts\nthemselves—e.g., that the sun hits the first line at daybreak\nand the last at dusk—confirm that. \nSo, Galen is optimistic about the attainability of reliable knowledge.\nYet the examples of mathematics and geometry at the same time point to\nthe most obvious challenge to this epistemological optimism. For,\nsurely, the gulf between the level of certainty available in those areas\nand that and that possible in the study of the biological world, let\nalone in the medical examination of individual cases, is an enormous\none. \nGalen seems remarkably confident about the possibility of secure\nknowledge, even in areas where he is able to produce little that looks\nlike a “demonstration”: to the above case of element\ntheory we might add, for example, the confident classification of\npathological states and their signs or, indeed, the quantificatory\naccount of drugs and their dosages in the pharmacological work. In all\nsuch cases, it seems, a method proceeding from reliable empirical\nstarting-points and applying sound logical method (and where relevant\ntraining the perceptual senses) may lead to secure knowledge. \nOn the other hand, in clinical practice we make the transition from\npropositions of universal validity—the sort which Galen believes\nhimself able to arrive at in the way seen above, through the\napplication of logical method on the basis of evident\nstarting-points—to the particular case; and Galen problematizes\nthis difference between general or universal (katholou) and\nindividual or particular (idion) (Chiaradonna 2013, van der\nEijk 2008). Each individual case is different; moreover, the existence\nis acknowledged of empirical experiences which are not expressible in\nwords (Dig. Puls. III.3, 914). This suggests a conclusion of\nconsiderable epistemological interest, namely that there are\nindividual phenomena which cannot be fully incorporated in the\nuniversal scientific account. \nCentral to the understanding of clinical practice, too, is that we are\nhere dealing with a system of symptoms or signs; and inference from\nsigns cannot give one the same kind of secure knowledge that is\navailable for propositions arrived at through demonstration. Galen\nhere engages in what was already a complex and sophisticated area of\ndiscussion, drawing on both Hippocratic texts (e.g., in the discussion\nof signs in his commentary on the Hippocratic Prognosticon)\nand debates in Hellenistic philosophy and medicine (Allen 2001,\nHankinson 2008a, van der Eijk 2008). As we have seen Galen, unlike the\nEmpiricists, believes that the observation of bodily signs—a\ncomplex range, for the ancient doctor—enables the expert to make\ninferences about the underlying bodily state and causal conditions.\nThe term endeixis here refers to the “indication”\nthat the observed body gives, both of what has caused its present\nstate, and of the appropriate treatment. \nGalen remains confident about epistemic success in this area too; yet\nit is important to make the appropriate distinctions in relation to\ncertainty and demonstrability. \nGalen claims that in his youth—partly in response to the\nconfusion caused by mutually contradictory philosophical sects, all\nclaiming certainty on unprovable issues—he nearly succumbed to\nthe lures of Skepticism (Lib. Prop. 14/11, 18). The above\npossibility of certainty, as provided by mathematics and geometry, is\nwhat saved him. But an understanding of the limits of human knowledge\nis as important as the project of acquiring it in those areas where\nthat is possible. Galen is scathing about those who commit themselves\nrashly on insufficient evidence, and about philosophers who debate\npropositions on which demonstrative knowledge is impossible (such as\nthe existence and nature of the void outside the cosmos) (Aff.\nPecc. Dig. II.6–7, 308–13). Here, one criterion to\nwhich he appeals in refusing to make pronouncements on certain\nquestions is their lack of relevance to “medicine or\nethical/practical philosophy” (e.g., Prop. Plac. 15,\n120; PHP IX.9, 600). \nYet the value of knowledge is not justified purely in pragmatic terms.\nIn Prop. Plac., Galen puts forward a more subtle, tripartite\ndivision of areas of knowledge: (1) matters on which he claims that it\nis possible to have, and that he has, certain knowledge; (2) matters\non which he claims no knowledge; and (3) matters on which he claims\nonly to be able to advance to the “plausible”, but where\nthe attempt to gain knowledge is still worthwhile, even though they\nare not of direct practical value (Prop. Plac. 14,\n114–17). This last category is in a sense the most interesting\nand Galenically distinctive. Such knowledge, he suggests, “would\nadorn the art, if knowledge could be obtained”; he seems here to\nassociate this category with element theory. If so, this\nacknowledgement of a limitation on certainty will affect our view of\nGalen’s “demonstrations” in this area\n (§3.1\n above). Perhaps, although it is not apparent from his\ndedicated—and highly polemical—discussions in Hipp.\nElem. and in HNH, this is after all an area where he\nadmits to something less than scientific certainty, at least in\ndetail. \nOne area in which Galen openly asserts his ignorance is that of the\n“substance/essence (ousia) of the soul”: is it a\nnon-bodily substance, as Plato thought, or composed of physical\nelements? (See further\n §6.4\n on ousia and §7 on soul-theory.) In spite of some strong\napparently physicalist statements in this area, Galen consistently\nthroughout the corpus denies that he knows the answer to this question\n(Donini 2008; Singer 2013: 32–33 and Ch. 4). The case is similar\nin response to the question, how information is transmitted into the\nembryo in the process of conception and foetal development. That one\nneeds to invoke some form of “intelligent design” is, to\nGalen, absolutely clear. But precisely who or what is responsible?\nHow does the infant acquire, from birth or even before, the\nability to perform all its innate functions? In an interestingly\nopen-ended discussion in Foet. Form. (6, 196–201),\nGalen ends with a genuine aporia: all existing options within\nthe tradition—the Platonic “world soul” extending\nthroughout matter, the presence of a rational soul in a pre-rational\nanimal, a plurality of souls for each individual muscle\nfunction—have consequences which make them unattractive; but he\ndoes not himself claim to have the answer. \nWe are left with a challenging and distinctive epistemological\nposition, explicitly asserting the limitations to human knowledge in\ncertain metaphysical or higher-level physical areas of enquiry, but\nanti-Skeptic and committed to the fundamental knowability of the\nphysical world, as well as to the value of the quest for knowledge in\nareas where reasoning on the basis of clear empirical observation\nand/or truths evident to reason makes that possible. \nGalen explicitly states that, using theoretical reasoning in\nconjunction with empirical evidence, progress in knowledge is\npossible. At the same time—a perception typical within\nGraeco-Roman culture—he regards the pathway from the\n“ancients”, in particular Hippocrates, to the moderns as\nin general a downward one, and “more recent”, in relation\nto medical or scientific authors, is usually a term of disapprobation.\nHe does, however, claim that progress in relation to the ancients is\npossible, and indeed that he has achieved it, in two chief senses. One\nis that, for example in anatomy, he has made certain specific\ndiscoveries unknown to his predecessors; the other, more substantial\nin his presentation, is the project of giving solid demonstrative form\nto propositions which (according to Galen) were known to the ancients,\nbut either stated by them without demonstration, or actually omitted\nfrom their writings (Opt. Med. 4, 34; Hankinson 1994a). \nIt is important to consider the historically specific attitude to\nauthority—to “the ancients”—which is in play\nhere. As we have seen, Galen apparently regards certain propositions\nas evident to reason which we might rather think are\n“endoxic”, or indeed simply well established in\ntraditional thought. More specifically, Galen has an enormous explicit\nadmiration for certain authors already regarded as classical in his\ntime, most especially Hippocrates and Plato, and devotes lengthy texts\nto their exegesis. He is both influenced by previous authors and\nexercised to present his own views as consistent with a body of\ntraditional thought. But his latter process is not a straightforward\nor uncritical one: different sets of authors are lined up as authority\nin different contexts; and authors highly respected in certain\ncontexts become the object of fierce criticism in others. (On these\nissues see Lloyd 1988; Singer 1996 and 2013, Ch. 4; Vegetti 1999; Von\nStaden 2009.) Galen explicitly states that he does not rely on\nHippocrates, “as others do”, uncritically or\nreverentially, but rather quotes him because he sees “that his\ndemonstrations are secure” (QAM 9, 399–400). So,\ntoo, with Plato: although agreeing with much of Platonic doctrine as\nhe understands it, and in a sense appearing to present himself\n“tribally” as a Platonist, Galen is quite capable of\ndisagreeing with Plato on points of detail. \nYet the very fact that Galen’s major treatise on\npsycho-physiology, PHP, is formally presented as a\nreconciliation of Hippocrates’ and Plato’s views is\ntelling—as indeed is the huge volume of exegetical work on\nHippocrates, and on Aristotelian logic. In practice, arguments from\nauthority have considerable value for Galen, at least as a persuasive\ntool, in spite of his explicit denials of that authority status; and there are\nprobably cultural reasons for his devotion to Plato and Hippocrates in\nparticular. However, his claim not to be a slavish sectarian is borne\nout; and no one—not Aristotle, not Plato, not even\nHippocrates—is exempt from criticism in particular contexts.\n \nWe have devoted considerable attention to the importance of logic for\nGalen in relation to the theory of demonstration and early\nintellectual training. Some account should also be given of his\ncontribution to the broader theoretical study of logic,\nbecause—although not of similar relevance to epistemology or the\ntheory of science—this contribution is, at least arguably, of\nconsiderable historical importance. \nCertain caveats must be given at the outset. Galen’s most\nimportant work in this area, Demonstration is lost to us\nexcept for fragments (though a shorter work, the important\nIntroduction to Logic (Inst. Log.), does survive); and the precise nature of\nGalen’s innovations, and final views, is a matter of debate\namongst experts (for an overview, as well as an account of different\nviews, see Morison 2008). In an area of great technical complexity and\ninterpretive difficulty, we can here attempt no more than the briefest\nsummary of the main issues and points of discussion. These may be\nsaid, broadly, to revolve around the questions of the nature and\nextent of the originality of Galen’s contribution, and of the\nway in which he draws upon the work of both Aristotle and the\nStoics. \nGalen’s commentary on Aristotle (in a way consistent with the\napproach considered in\n §3.5)\n involves not just explication but also addition. He claims that in\nhis commentary on the Categories (again, unfortunately lost)\nhe added an eleventh category to Aristotle’s ten: that of\n“composition”. In the context of Aristotelian syllogistic\nlogic, meanwhile, there is some suggestion that he felt it necessary\nto posit a fourth figure in addition to the Aristotelian three. In\nfact, there seems considerable doubt concerning both the value of such\na fourth figure and Galen’s authorship of it (Morison 2008:\n85–91); a preferable interpretation may be that references to\nthis “fourth syllogism” are not to a new categorization\nwithin the system of Aristotle’s simple syllogisms, but rather\n(more interestingly) to an original attempt at the analysis of\ncompound syllogisms, which Galen apparently carried out with specific\nreference to certain arguments in Plato. \nNo less interpretively challenging is the material concerning the\nother main areas of Galen’s contribution, those relating to\nhypothetical logic and to the “relational syllogism”. The\nsubject again resists non-specialist summary; but it seems\nuncontroversial, at least, (a) that Galen engages in detail with Stoic\nhypothetical syllogistic; (b) that he attacks the Stoics for\nparticular aspects of their use of it; and (c) that this attack is in\nsome way related to his own insistence on the priority of\n“things” over “expressions” (a motto which\nruns through much of Galen’s other work, too, in the context of\ndiscussions of language). A final area of complexity and doubt\nconcerns the relational syllogism, the introduction of which Galen\nclaims as his innovation at Inst. Log. 16.\nWhat seems clear is that Galen brought this new type of syllogism\nforward in response to what he perceived as inadequacies in both\nAristotelian and Stoic logic; also that he believed it to be of\nparticular relevance for proofs in geometry and mathematics. An\nexample of a relational syllogism—from which such relevance is\nindeed clear—is: \nTheo has twice as many possessions as Dio;\n\nbut Philo has twice as many possessions as Theo;\n\ntherefore, Philo has four times as many possessions as Dio. \n(One puzzling feature of relational syllogisms as presented by Galen\nis that he apparently sometimes does and sometimes does not mention\nthe relevant axiom on which the syllogism depends, as part of the\nsyllogism.) \nExperts have found Galen’s theoretical contribution to logic not\nonly interpretively problematic, but also ultimately frustrating in\nits failure both to give a clear and consistent account of itself and\nto fulfil its ambition systematically to provide what is missing in\nthe pre-existing tradition. What does seem clear is that Galen made a\ndistinctive and in some ways influential and challenging contribution\nin this area, responding in an original way to both the Aristotelian\nand the Stoic logical tradition; and that even in the most abstract\nrealm of logical analysis he retained a concern for the practical\nvalue of logic and its relatedness to things. \nIn strongly Aristotelian terms, Galen insists on the importance of\nidentifying the teleological cause, the “for the sake of the\nbetter”, in accounts of the natural world, especially those\nwhich involve animals and human beings; he also seems strongly\nindebted to Aristotle in his presentation of material causation,\nspecifically of the four-quality or four-element theory which is\ncentral to his accounts of change in the natural world, the biological\nworld in particular. These two types of causal account run through the\nGalenic corpus, receiving different formulations in different\ncontexts; in\n §5.2\n below we shall consider them in more detail, and the nature of their\nrelationship with each other and with other causal schemes. First, we\nshall consider the comparatively smaller topic of Galen’s own\nexplicit discussions of causal schemes and causal terminology. \nGalen’s causal accounts bear very clear echoes of Aristotle,\nboth linguistically and in the fundamental approach to causal\nexplanations in the natural world. At the same time, where Galen gives\nan explicit listing of the number of different causes that may be used\nin such explanations, he refers explicitly to Plato and seems indebted\nto the Platonic tradition. In a passage of UP—the work\nwhich has the strongest Aristotelian echoes in this teleological\nsense—he gives a list of five causes, which seems closely\nrelated to one attested elsewhere in Platonist writing: final,\nefficient, material, instrumental, formal (UP VI.12; see\nHankinson 1994b and 1998). On the other hand, the list comes in a\ndialectical context, and Galen is certainly not in general concerned\nto give accounts which mention all five. Of those in this\n“official” list, it is the teleological and material that\nrecur and are of most significance elsewhere. One might ask about the\nrole of the two other “Aristotelian” causes, the formal\nand the efficient. Explicitly, Galen has little role for the latter\n(although it is mentioned in an account of the demiurge’s\nconstruction of the body; see further below). As for the formal:\ncertainly, forms (eidē) are of great importance in\nGalen’s biology, where an account of both form and matter is\nnecessary in the description of animals and their development. Forms,\nindeed, have a close conceptual relationship with the teleological\ncause, as the way in which design or structure enters the physical\nworld; at the same time, their relationship with matter and in\nparticular with the concept of mixture is difficult to extricate (see\nfurther\n §6). \nGalen also makes use of a further set of causal categories, which are\nderived partly from the Stoic philosophical and partly from the\nmedical tradition. Of particular importance—especially in\nmedical contexts—are the concepts of “antecedent”\n(prokatarktikai) and “preceding”\n(proēgoumenai) causes; the further category of\n“containing” or “cohesive”\n(sunektikai) causes is also discussed. (Galen devoted two\nworks explicitly to these causal concepts, CP and\nCC; see further Hankinson 1994b, 2008a.) While rejecting the\nspecific Stoic theory to which this last category belongs, namely that\nobjects require this type of cause as explanation of their\npersistence, Galen employs the concept to a limited extent, allowing\nthat something productive of a particular effect, and co-temporal with\nthat effect, may be considered its “containing cause”. \nThe other two categories are of more significance. They help, for\nexample, to explain how certain things may be called\n“causes” even though they do not always bring about the\neffect in question. Antecedent causes are conditions which raise the\nlikelihood of an outcome in a body (say, the occurrence of a disease);\nthese are typically external conditions, for example extreme ambient\nheat or moisture. But the presence of such causes does not guarantee\nthe outcome; this will depend on internal differences in the\nconstitution of the bodies in question, and in particular a preceding\ncause will be required to trigger the outcome. Again, Galen uses this\nframework in an epistemologically optimistic way, highlighting the\nability of the expert to predict or correctly analyse such an outcome,\ngiven sufficient understanding of all the relevant causal\nfeatures. \nThere is a strong emphasis on teleology in nature, and on the\ninadequacy of causal accounts that omit this. The major context for\nthis is UP, a text explicitly inspired by Aristotle. In this\n17-volume magnum opus, Galen goes through the parts of the body one by\none, in each case giving an account which justifies the proposition of\nthe purposive nature of the construction. Taking Aristotle’s\napproach (especially that of Parts of Animals), and the motto\n“Nature does nothing in vain”, as starting-points, he is\nconcerned to prove the perfect, providential nature of the\nconstruction of parts for the benefit of the animal, especially in the\ncontext of humans. Important, from the outset, is to insist upon the\ncorrect direction of causation: we have hands, etc., because we are\nintelligent (the view he attributes to Aristotle), not the other way\nround (the view he attributes to Anaxagoras) (UP I.3,\n69–70). \nAs so often in Galen, the polemical aim is of major importance for the\nformulation of the argument. The recurrent target is that group of\nthinkers who deny intelligence or purpose as an explanans, and omit it\nfrom their causal accounts. Here Galen lumps together: a variety of\nancient Atomist theorists; the followers of the Hellenistic medical\nauthor Erasistratus; and those of the more recent Asclepiades of\nBithynia. All are accused of giving accounts which omit intelligence\nin the relevant sense, relying entirely on either spontaneous motions\nof bodies or mechanistic explanations of biological processes to\nexplain the formation and maintenance of the complex processes of the\nhuman body. \nThere are further, distinctive features of the teleological account in\nUP. One is that—in a highly intriguing and\nindividualistic discussion which however is not developed in any\ndetail (UP XI.14)—Galen introduces the notion of the\naesthetic alongside that of function. Some features of the human body\nare to be explained not just in terms of its being better for\nthem to be so, but in terms of their making the body more\nbeautiful. (Examples are the male foreskin and the buttocks,\nboth of which hide what would otherwise be unsightly, and the beard in\nmen.) \nThe same chapter is also interesting for the explicit contrast it\nmakes between intelligent design as Galen, in the post-Platonic Greek\ntradition, understands it, and intelligent design as understood in the\nJewish tradition. Here Galen famously contrasts his (Platonic) view\nwith what he describes as that of the “Mosaic philosophy”,\nthe creation ex nihilo in which God’s will is the only\nrelevant cause to which there is no limitation. \nFor Galen, the purpose of the divine Craftsman is, certainly, the most\nimportant cause, but the material cause must also be mentioned in a\nfull account: matter represents the building-blocks used to realize\nthe design, and in a sense provides a limitation to it. This\ninteraction between design and material—and the assertion of the\nfinal cause in opposition to those who deny it—are the central\nfeatures of Galen’s account. In the (strikingly anthropomorphic)\naccount of the Craftsman’s construction of the human body at\nUP VI.13, however, Galen does indeed incorporate the five\ncauses listed above. The Craftsman constructs the organs of the body\nas they are “because it is better so”, thus also bringing\nabout the best possible “form”: this covers both final and\nformal causes. We must then see how he employs both\n“instruments” and “matter” to do so: this will\ntake account of both instrumental and material causes. and although\nthe distinction between these too may seem somewhat fluid, it it is\nfurther clarified that we should understand the wet and the dry as\nproviding the material cause, while the hot and the cold are the\n“active instruments” which the Craftsman uses to shape\nthese. This corresponds to the Aristotelian distinction between the\nactive and the passive pair amongst the fundamental elements (see\nbelow,\n §6.1).\n In summarizing the five causes at the end of this passage, Galen uses\nthe phrase “from the Craftsman” instead of\n“efficient”. \nGalen explicitly characterizes UP as a hymn to the divine\ncreator (XVII.2–3, 732–33). This, of course, is not\nreligion in any conventional sense: rather, it is the fact that one\nhas gained detailed, in-depth knowledge, both of anatomy and of the\nchreia of the parts revealed in anatomy—that is, of the\nclose, detailed relationship between their their structure and their\nfunctional purpose—that enables one to celebrate the creator\nappropriately. \nThe question arises, both within the teleological analysis of\nUP, and much more broadly throughout the Galenic corpus, of\nthe relationship between the different causes. Some scholars have seen\na tension between teleology and material causation in Galen (and some\neven believed that they could identify a chronological development,\nfrom the “early” position of UP, with its clear\nAristotelian “instrumentalism”, to the apparent\nphysicalism or materialism of the “late”\nQAM—on which see\n §7\n below). (For exploration of the issues see Singer 1997b.) \nTo put it at its weakest, we may say that there are discussions of\nbiological phenomena in which the teleological account appears to\nrecede and an account in material terms seems to be all that is\nthought relevant. But it seems possible to go further.\nWhereas—at the risk of simplifying a highly complex\ntopic—interpretations of Aristotle would tend to stress the\nco-existence and co-operation of the different causes, or at least of\nthe material and the final and/or formal, in causal accounts in the\nnatural world, certain Galenic passages seem to suggest (while making\nspecific reference to Aristotle) that different types of causal\naccount may be applicable at different levels within the natural or\nbiological world. Considering, in the context of this discussion of\nbodily mixture, what constitutes perfection in a human being, Galen\nstates:  \nthe man … must not just be at the median of moisture and\ndryness, but must also have the best possible construction\n[or “shaping”:\ndiaplasis]—something which is perhaps a consequence of\nthat good balance of the four elements, but may have some higher cause\nof a more divine nature (Temp. I.9, 229);  \nlater, he attacks  \nthe failure to regard the natural cause of our construction as a\ncraftsmanlike power, whereby the parts are formed in a way suited to\nthe characters of our souls,  \nand goes on to claim that Aristotle raised a doubt as to whether this\ncraftsmanlike power  \nshould be attributed to some more divine cause, rather than just to\nhot, cold, dry, and wet (Temp. II.6, 261). \nIt seems that material causation is adequate in some areas, while\ndesign-based causation needs to be invoked at a higher level, in\nparticular when one needs to explain animal and in particular human\nstructures and their operations. \nWhereas one might think (on Aristotelian grounds) that an account in\nterms of the elements should be one that would simultaneously\ninvolve a material and a formal or final account, that is, that they\npick out different aspects of the reality, matter always requiring a\ncertain sort of organization, which corresponds to the formal or final\naccount—and, further, such a perception is arguably borne out by\nQAM, with its suggested equation of bodily mixture with\neidos, implying that formal account will includes material\nelements in an appropriate way (see\n §7.2\n below)—the above-cited texts seem to suggest that there is a\nhigher-level cause which is added to the material cause in certain\ncontexts, in particular, those that involve organic and higher-level\nstructures. \nRelatedly, Galen at times makes a distinction between bodily features\nwhich were intended as part of the primary design or rationale\n(kata prōton logon) and those which follow by necessity,\nthrough physical causation, as a by-product of that design\n(Temp. II.5, 253; cf. UP XI.14, 534–36 on how\nprovidential design takes account of necessary physical consequences).\nAgain, the result of such an analysis would seem to be that not all\nfeatures of an animal can be equally part of a teleological account,\nor not part of it in the same sense. Certain things seem to happen\nspontaneously, or to follow unavoidably from the purposive cause,\nthough not themselves intended. \nThis leads us to a broader question. To what extent can lower-level,\nelemental, descriptions constitute full accounts of higher-level\nphenomena in the body? Two examples might be used to highlight the\nquestion: would a sufficiently full account of the nature of the\nmixture of the brain be an exhaustive account of what is happening in\nthe psychē? And could a sufficiently full account of the\nbalance of qualities—the most basic physical level—in a\nhuman body constitute an exhaustive account also (i) of its\nhigher-level constituents, (ii) of the inception and (iii) of the\nnature of the diseases that befall the animal in that state, e.g., of\na particular fever, or other disease state? \nWe shall return to the former question under\n §7.2.\n The answer to the latter is complex, partly because of tendency for\ndifferent conceptual areas to be discussed separately (e.g., the\naccounts of the composition and “mixture”\n(krasis) of the human body, though it includes an account of\n“bad-mixtures” (duskrasiai), is separate from\nthat of fevers, or of melancholy). \nBut the three subsections of this question may yield somewhat\ndifferent answers. (i) Galen clearly distinguishes three levels of\nbodily analysis: qualities/elements, humours and homoeomerous or\nuniform parts and organs. (Humours, such as blood or bile, are in a\nsense uniform, although in a more detailed distinction of levels, they\nconstitute a further layer, between elements and uniform parts, see\nHipp. Elem. 8, 126–7.) Here, too, Galen is heavily\nindebted to Aristotle (in particular to book II of the Parts of\nAnimals). A formulation which Galen uses in relation to this\nthree-level analysis is that the organic parts arise from the\n“composition, amount, magnitude and shaping” of the\nuniform parts, which in turn depend on a correct balance of the\nelements hot, cold, wet and dry (San. Tu. I.1, 3). It seems\nclear, although it is not always explicitly stated, that analysis at\nthe organic level should, in principle, involve the teleological\ncause; as we have seen, this may not always be the case of analysis at\nlower levels, though Galen is exercised by the problem of how\nbiological substances or low-level organisms contain within them the\nprinciples which bring about the relevant teleological or functional\naims (see further\n §6.2). \nIn the pathological area it seems more difficult to see the relevance\nof the teleological cause. (ii) Galen does seems to think that a\nsufficiently full account of the internal and external low-level\nconditions should be fully predictive of the disease outcome (this,\nthen, will be a question of understanding in sufficient detail the\npredisposing and antecedent causes). (iii) Certainly fevers are hot\ndiseases and, moreover, their individual differences—as well as\nthe treatment indicated—are to a considerable extent explicable\nin terms of the terminology of the fundamental qualities. Yet once\nthey take hold, they function according to a complex rationale (Galen\nsometimes uses the term idea, “form” or\n“structure”, related to the Aristotelian term for form,\neidos, in reference to such disease entities) and appear to\nhave their own causal powers; the best interpretation of the Galenic\npicture may, however, well be that such powers would in theory (via\nsome complex hypothetical account which Galen understandably does not\nfeel the need to consider) be fully explicable in terms of the states\nand interactions of fundamental qualities. \nIt is worth pursuing this line of enquiry a little further, in\nrelation to Galen’s account of primary and secondary properties\nand of emergent properties. On the one hand, all properties\ndiscernible by the senses can be understood on the basis of the\nprimary qualities that exist at the elemental level. On the other, it\nis an essential part of Galen’s theory of the composition of\nliving bodies from elements that there are qualitatively different\nproperties at higher levels—that there are, in our terms,\nemergent properties. The fact that we experience pain and sensation,\nwhereas elemental bodies do not, shows that there has been a\nfundamental transformation in their nature, in the process of the\ncomposition of higher-level bodies from lower-level ones. In\nprinciple, then, we might think, the fact that hot, cold, wet and dry\nare the relevant explanatory terms at the lowest level would not\nnecessarily mean that they are helpful terms at the highest\nlevel—that of everyday experience. After all, we talk in\nperceptual terms of substances being sharp, acidic, bitter,\netc.—and indeed Galen talks in such terms—without in each\ncase finding it important to give the causal explanation of those\nsecondary properties in elemental terms. More than that: we might\nexpect it to be the case that the use of these elemental terms was\nsimply not helpful or relevant, precisely because of the Galenic\ntheorization, just noted, of higher-level or secondary qualities as\ndifferent in their nature from those elemental ones. \nYet what is striking is that in spite of that theoretical apparatus,\nwhich would in principle mean that one might abandon talk in terms of\nhot, cold, wet and dry at higher levels of explanation—in\nparticular, in the advanced medical realm of disease description and\ntreatment—precisely these terms remain the central ones. Other\ndescriptive and experiential terms are used, of course; but what is\nremarkable is that, precisely in that area where Galen makes his most\nelaborate attempt to classify substances according to their properties\nand effects, namely in his extremely lengthy accounts of\ndrugs—accounts which include, one should add, a significant\nelement of quantificatory analysis—the “scientific”\nterms of description remain precisely these: hot, cold, wet and dry.\n \nWe have already considered Galen’s physical analysis in the\nbroader context of his causal theory, as well as in relation to his\nnotions of demonstration. This section will give some further detail\non that physical theory, considering further aspects of Galen’s\naccount of change in the physical and biological world, as well as the\nrelevance of the concepts of form and matter, of substance, and of\npowers. \nFor Galen the fundamental constituents or elements\n(stoicheia) of physical bodies are the hot, the cold, the wet\nand the dry. It is also legitimate to state that the elements are\nfire, air, water and earth; this alternative choice Galen tends to\npresent as philosophically unimportant: it is just a question of\nwhether one prefers to talk in terms of qualities\n(poiotētes, i.e., the hot, etc.) or of bodies\n(sōmata, i.e., fire, etc.). \nAlthough he describes this difference as largely one of presentation,\nthe alternative formulation in terms of the cosmic elements (fire,\nearth, air, water) is important for Galen, because it is central to\nhis argument that the only coherent way in which a theory of elements\nin the body can be understood is in terms of the extremes of\nqualities; and, further, that (since, e.g., the extreme of hot is\nfire) such an understanding automatically entails the equivalence of\nthose elements in the body with the elements outside the body, in the\ncosmos: fire, earth, air and water. \nIn fact, there is some complexity in Galen’s precise view of\nelements, and in particular as to the relationship of fire, air,\nearth, water (which henceforward, for convenience, I shall term\n“element-bodies”) with hot, cold, wet, dry (henceforward,\n“element-qualities”). Although at times he uses the term\nstoicheia for both element-bodies and element-qualities, in\nhis most detailed account, in HNH (I.3; cf. Hipp.\nElem. 6, esp. 112–16), he clarifies that properly speaking\nthe former are elements, stoicheia, in the sense that they\ncannot be physically separated into anything else, but that they are\nfurther conceptually divisible into different\n“principles” (archai): specifically, each of the\nelement-bodies (stoicheia) must be understood as the outcome\nof the reception into a substrate, quality-less matter, of the extreme\nof a particular quality (that is, the element-qualities).\nGalen’s element theory seems in many respects closely modelled\non Aristotle’s; but at this point he adopts terminology\n(quality-less matter = apoios hulē) which is Stoic in\norigin; the presence of an analogous concept is much less clear in\nAristotle. Moreover, the precise relationship between specific\nelement-bodies and specific element-qualities is somewhat confusing,\nboth in terms of Galen’s explicit discussions of it and in terms\nof the relationship of his model to the Aristotelian and Stoic\nones. \nTo summarize in an interpretively difficult area: Stoic theory has each\nelement-body corresponding to the extreme of one\nelement-quality (fire to the hot, etc.); Galen not only seems at times\nto highlight such one-to-one correspondences, focussing on the\nelement-bodies as instantiating the element-qualities in their\n“uncombined and unmixed” states; such associations also\nseem epistemologically or heuristically crucial for the establishment\nof certain features of the human body and their relationship with the\nexternal world: the theoretical extreme of hot automatically leads one\nto the concept of fire, for example. On the other hand, it seems clear\nfrom certain passages in Hipp. Elem. and HNH that\nGalen remains committed to the Aristotelian view (as outlined in\nDe generatione et corruptione), whereby each element-body\narises from a pairing of element-qualities (though he does\nnot seem to follow the Aristotelian doctrine that one element-quality\nis dominant in each of these pairings, rather describing each\nas present in extreme form). \nFinally, in relation to Galen’s element theory, one should\nconsider the distinction between the more active and the more passive\nelements. This (again Aristotelian) distinction seems not, in general,\nto be a feature of the Galenic elements; yet it does play a role in\nthe account of the purposive construction of the body, whereby the hot\nand the cold function as instruments, the dry and the wet as mere\nmaterial, for the Craftsman (see above,\n §5.2). \nIn the description of higher-level bodies—that of animals, in\nparticular—one must invoke the concept of their form\n(eidos). Again we have a Galenic version of an Aristotelian\nconcept, with form understood as opposed to matter, on the one hand,\nand to the broader classificatory category, genos, on the\nother. \nForm, we have seen, is a structural concept which for Galen is closely\nrelated to the notion of design and teleological explanation: a\nsuccessful account of how the structure of a body is “for the\nbetter” will simultaneously involve an account of its form,\ni.e., of the particular way in which matter is purposefully structured\nwithin that body. \nThe precise way in which form relates to matter, however, is complex\nand resists easy summation. We might rather point to a few contexts in\nwhich Galen invokes form in physical explanations. In embryology, form\nrepresents the component of design (in modern terms, of information)\nwhich is transmitted to the embryo from the parents, as opposed to the\nmatter out of which it is constructed. It thus becomes an explicit\nquestion (problematized in different ways both in the early text\nSem. and in the late one Foet. Form.), how\nthe form is present in the matter, and what is the nature of the\nprocess of interaction. In the former text, for example, the process\ncrucially involves the interaction of pneuma (breath,\ncontaining the formal element) and blood (containing the appropriate\nmatter); and a distinction is made between ousia (in the\nmaterial sense) and the power that moves and shapes it. \nIn the account of the different physical composition of different\nanimals and human beings in Temp., meanwhile, eidos\nis the term used to refer to different species—each of which has\nits own different internal organization and range of typical\nqualities. This has a particular importance for accurate physical\ndescription, especially of the kind relevant for the doctor: it is by\nreference to this eidos that we meaningfully apply adjectives\nsuch as hot or cold to a body. It is not relevant whether they are hot\nor cold in some abstract sense, in relation to the whole cosmos, nor\nwhether they possess those properties by comparison with members of a\ndifferent eidos. The assessment of those qualities must be\ncarried out in relation to a theoretical midpoint specific to that\ncreature’s eidos, which will have its own possible\nrange of mixtures, as well as its own optimal mixture. Mixtures\nthemselves can be classified according to their eidos; and\nthis same classificatory terminology (we might here use a term like\n“types”) may be applied also to such other theoretical items as diseases. And\nin QAM (see below,\n §7.2)\n it is stated, with Aristotelian authority (or perhaps rather: the\nview is attributed to the school of Aristotle), that form, in the\ncontext of a certain level of biological analysis, means the same as\nmixture; and that this level of biological analysis is that relevant\nto the soul itself. \nThe coming-to-be of different physical substances in the world, as\nwell as their various properties, is explained through the concept of\nmixture (krasis). Every physical thing in the world, in\nparticular the biological world, is composed from mixtures of the\nfundamental elements; they are thus appropriately described in terms\nof the predominance of one or more qualities (hot, cold, etc.) within\nthe mixture. Galen holds that higher-level properties come about\nthrough the alteration that may take place in this process of mixture;\nat the same time, the fundamental, low-level properties—hot,\ncold, wet and dry—which predominate in a given body remain\npowerful explanantia of its nature, at the macroscopic, perceptible\nlevel too; and this applies, for example, both to human bodies and to\nthe various things they may eat and drink, including both food\nsubstances and drugs. \nWe should say a little more about the nature of mixture and change. As\nin many areas, Galen here tries to avoid some particular intricate and\nunanswerable metaphysical debates, while insisting on certain fixed\npoints. One of the latter, as we have seen, is the four-element\ntheory; another is the understanding of the physical world as a\ncontinuum, rather than as some set of bodies interspersed with void.\nAs to the nature of the change that takes place in mixture:\nkrasis must be understood to be a process in which the\nelements involved undergo some fundamental change; it is not a mere\nplacing alongside each other of tiny quanta of different substances\n(as might happen in mixing two powders), whereby those substances\nthemselves remain in principle capable of being separated, and retain\ntheir original properties. What happens, rather, is that a new\nsubstance arises with distinct properties, and the smallest imaginable\nquantum of this new substance would have those distinct properties,\nnot those of the elements from which it was mixed. \nHere Galen again draws on Stoic terminology, and talks of the\n“total mixture” (krasis di’ holōn). In\nStoic theory, this “total mixture” involves the notion\nthat the two bodies mixed in this particular way co-inhabit one space.\nGalen does not commit himself on the precise metaphysical description,\nbut seems to prefer the formulation that the qualities\n(poiotētes) undergo total mixture while the bodies do\nnot. \nThis, then, is Galen’s account of how a new type of substance\ncomes about through the combination of two other substances. And here\nhe makes the distinction between the kind of change where a substance\naffects another in just one or other of its qualities—heating\nit, for example, or heating it and drying it—and another,\nobserved particularly in the assimilation of food, which involves\nchange in respect of the whole substance (kath’\nholēn tēn ousian, and similar expressions); the distinction is\nelaborated in Temp. (III.1, 270; III.4, 277; cf. Hipp.\nElem. 9, 132–9), as well as in Galen’s theoretical\nwork on the action of drugs, SMT, III.4); at Prop.\nPlac. (9, 84–7), he talks of the “specificity”\nor “specific quality” (idiotēs) of the substance\nconsidered as a whole. This specific quality, apparently, inheres in\nthe substance, as something separate from its components; we might say that Galen here comes\nclose to articulating a notion of emergent properties: such an\nidiotēs marks the substance out as qualitatively distinct\nfrom the substances that went into its composition. \nThis leads us to a more focussed discussion of the notion of\nsubstance, ousia, and also the role in Galen’s\nexplanations of powers or capacities (dunameis). The\ndiscussion of ousia in Galen is complex, because he uses the\nterm both to refer to material stuffs of various kinds (as in the\neveryday contemporary English usage of the term\n“substance”, and in an Aristotelian metaphysical sense, to\nrefer to something’s essence, what it defintionally is (see\nabove,\n §3.1).\n Thus, ousia is used as synonymous with matter\n(hulē), and contrasted with form, in the embryological\ntreatise Sem.; but the question, “what is the\nousia of the soul?” admits of non-materialist as well\nas materialist answers. \nWhile the question of Galen’s conception of ousia is\ncomplex and under-researched, involving a huge number of potentially\nrelevant texts, one line of interpretation that seems plausible is\nthat this very homonymy is in fact significant for Galen’s\nmetaphyics: that is to say, that although the Aristotelian sense of\nousia is in principle distinct from the\n“everyday”, material one, there may be a tendency in Galen\nto elide the two usages, to conceive the answer to the question of\nsomething’s ousia in physical terms. \nIn either case, different ousiai are items that are\ndefinitionally different, different types of thing, not just\nqualitatively different versions or sub-categories of one thing. A\nrelevant example is that of the three parts of the Platonic tripartite\nsoul. Although typically referred to as different capacities\n(dunameis), it is more correct to state that they are three\ndifferent substances (ousiai)—partly because, in fact,\neach one of them itself has a number of capacities (PHP VI.3,\n374–5; cf. QAM 2, 377 and 4, 386). And, as we have\nseen, the notion of a change “in the whole substance” as\nopposed to a mere change in qualities is an important one in\nGalen’s physics; this gives an account of one type of\nthing’s turning into another. \nSo, a substance has capacities. This is important for Galen because it\nprovides him with a way of formulating his natural philosophy in\nopposition to either Atomism (random motions of bodies which are\nthemselves indistinguishable in their properties) or mechanism, in\nparticular the view attributed to Erasistratus that all processes in\nthe body can be causally reduced to the mechanical principle of\nhorror vacui (pros to kenoumenon akolouthia)—a\nview attacked at length in Nat. Fac. \nRather, Galen insists, bodies (or substances) in the natural world\nhave distinct capacities; in particular, there are four such\ncapacities shared by all plant and animal bodies, the actions of which\naccount for biological functions such as nutrition in a way which\nAtomist or mechanist views cannot. These capacities are: attractive,\nretentive, alterative, expulsive (e.g., Nat. Fac.\nIII.4–8; UP IV.7; Temp. III.1,\n269–70). \nAgain, we may think in terms of emergent properties: how these natural\ncapacities come about is not something that Galen is able to explain\nin detail, but they are properties of higher-level bodies which are\nnot present in the elements, and must somehow arise in the former\nthrough the process of composition from the latter. (These latter also\nhave capacities, but fundamental ones: fire has the capacity of\nheating, water of moistening, etc.) It is noteworthy that in a passage\nalready cited (Prop. Plac. 9, 84–7) the\n“internal management” (dioikein) of the parts\naccording to the natural capacities is closely related to this notion\nof activities or functions belonging to a part of the body “in\nvirtue of its whole substance”. \nGalenic explanations in terms of capacities risk appearing circular;\nindeed, their post-Galenic descendants were famously mocked as such by\nMolière. Galen in fact admits openly that the statement that a\nsubstance or body “has an f-ic capacity” does not\nadd anything to the statement that that substance or body “is\ncapable of f-ing” (QAM 2, 377), even adding that\n“we use the term ‘capacity’ when we do not know the\nsubstance (ousia!) of the active cause” (Nat.\nFac. I.4). \nThe statement that bodies have capacities, then, can be understood\nsimply as the acknowledgement of the existence of tendencies to\nperform specific activities of functional relevance for the organism.\nFor Galen, of course, this acknowledgement is intimately linked with\nthe assertion of purposive design and the denial that Atomism or\nmechanism could ever give a satisfactory account of such\nproperties. \nWe can, however, go a little further, and state that there are points,\nat least, where Galen attempts to give some more concrete account of\nwhat a capacity is or how it works. At Praes. Puls. II.9,\n305–6, he states that “the substance (ousia) of a\ncapacity is nothing other than a certain mixture”. And we might\nrelate that formulation to the central, if not definitional, role\ngiven to mixture in the account of the soul’s capacities (see\n §7.2). \nGalen’s work on the “soul” (psychē) is\namongst the most interesting aspects of his philosophical-medical\noutput, and has attracted considerable scholarly attention in the last\n40 years (see esp. Gill 2010, Singer 2013, with extensive further\nbibliography); at the same time it is an area beset with interpretive\ncomplexities. Galen’s moral psychology, or philosophy of mind,\nbases itself strongly on Plato, while also attempting to do justice to\nthe contemporary state of knowledge in anatomy and physiology, and\nalso taking on much from both philosophical and medical traditions\nwhich tie the psychē and its pathology closely to a theory\nof elements or humours, classifying or conceptualizing its pathology\nin terms of physical imbalances of the body (especially of the\nbrain). \nThese complexities, and difficulties of interpretation, have led some\nto talk of the uneasy co-existence of different “models of the\nsoul” in Galen (see Manuli 1986, 1988; Singer 2013:\n18–33). Certainly, any study of Galen’s theoretical\naccounts of the soul must involve an analysis of many different texts,\nboth those specifically devoted to the theory of the psychē,\nand ones which touch on it in a wide range of different contexts\n(physiological, pathological, dietetic, pharmacological); it must also take account of the fact that these\ntexts belong to quite different technical genres and draw upon a\nvariety of traditions, intellectual approaches and specialist concepts\nand vocabularies; and of the fact that the focus of the argument is radically\ndifferent in some of these different contexts. Again, in any attempt\nto summarize Galen’s “philosophy of mind”, the\ncaution should be made that his primary motivation and intellectual\nconcern throughout nearly all these texts are those of the practising\nphysician, not those of the theoretical philosopher. \nGalen is strongly Platonist in central areas of his thought; this\napplies in particular to his moral psychology, where he adopts the\nPlatonic division of the soul into rational and non-rational parts,\nthe latter being further divided into the spirited\n(thumoeides) and the desiderative (epithumētikon).\nThis fundamental rational/non-rational distinction, and the further\none between the two non-rational parts, are for Galen essential to a\ncorrect conceptualization of the soul and its internal workings, and\nin particular to a correct approach to ethics (see further\n §8\n below). \nYet Platonic tripartition is also central to Galen’s physiology\nof the whole body. The three parts—rational, spirited,\ndesiderative—correspond to and are located in, respectively, the\nbrain, the heart and the liver. These are the central organs in\nGalen’s physiology, responsible respectively for: rational\nthought, perception and voluntary motion; involuntary motions\n(especially pulse and respiration) necessary to the maintenance of\nlife; and blood-production and nutrition. Galen’s adaptation of\nthe Platonic tripartite soul theory is strikingly original and\nintellectually ambitious. (He finds explicit textual justification for\nthese bodily locations of the soul parts in a passage from\nPlato’s Timaeus—although that text is primarily\nconcerned to give an ethically normative account of the internal\nbalance of the soul, not to advance a serious or detailed\nphysiology.) \nWe might thus think that, according to this scheme, the\npsychē properly belongs within just one part of the\n“tripartite soul”, that located in the brain; and indeed\nGalen does also (especially in anatomical-physiological contexts) use\npsychē and its cognates in this narrower sense to refer to\nthe brain and its functions. \nThere may seem to be a problematic relationship between the tripartite\nsoul as it is discussed in Galen’s specific ethical works, in\nparticular Aff. Pecc. Dig., and this physiological conception\n(e.g., in PHP). The former ethical discussions give no\nsignificant account of a bodily aspect to psychic function, while in\nthe latter context certain features central to that ethical account\nare absent or recede. The internal interrelation of the parts, so\nessential to the ethical account (see below) is not only absent from\nthe physiological account; it is quite difficult to see how it could\nbe mapped onto it. \nThe Greek psychē is a broader concept than can be equated\nwith either “mind” or “soul”: it is the vital\nprinciple—that the presence of which accounts for life in the\nbody—as well as more specifically the locus of thought\nand moral activity. All vital activities, in this sense, can be\ndefined as “of the psychē”, which is thus\nresponsible for both (in our terms) mental and physical function. The\nhēgemonikon is responsible for intellectual activity and\nmemory, for voluntary motion and for perception; and each of these is\nalso to be understood in terms of brain and/or nerve function. It is\ntempting, in view of the correlations that Galen explores, both\nbetween the functioning of the rational soul and states of the brain,\nand between emotional disturbances and states or activities of the\nheart and blood, to see him as advancing either some form of dual\naspect theory or, indeed, a mind-body identity theory. It seems clear,\nhowever, that Galen does not in any clear or consistent way elaborate\nsuch a clear or unified scheme (see further\n §7.2). \nIt is important to understand the anatomical-medical, as opposed to\nnarrowly philosophical, background here. Galen’s theory is\nheavily influenced by the work of the Hellenistic medical authors\nHerophilus and Erasistratus (third century BCE). This crucially\nincluded the discovery of the nervous system, as well as some detailed\nknowledge and theorization of the anatomy and functions of the brain\n(all, of course, quite unknown to Plato, with whose theory Galen\nattempts to harmonize them); see von Staden 2000. Galen’s\nconception of brain, heart and liver as “sources”\n(archai) of the three Platonic parts of the soul is\ninextricably linked with his anatomical understanding of the three\nsets of channels (nerves, arteries, veins) through which they\noperate. \nIt is also significant that Galen equates Plato’s\nlogistikon (“rational”) with the\nhēgemonikon (“leading-part”): the concepts are\n(in origin at least) distinct and derive from different conceptions of\nthe soul. The latter is a Stoic term, although probably also\nprominent in the Hellenistic medical authors just mentioned: it is the\nnotion of a single “command centre” for the soul, which\ncommunicates to the rest of the body, both receiving the information\nof the different sense organs and giving the command (in Stoic\nlanguage, the assent) for voluntary actions. Such a single command\ncentre is not (at least explicitly) present in Plato; similarly,\nsuch a physically centralized psychic concept is at best vaguely\npresent in Aristotle. \nGalen is centrally concerned to refute the Stoic view of the\nhēgemonikon as located in the heart, as against the\nPlatonic-Galenic view of its location in the brain. In the process,\nwhile asserting his allegiance to Platonic thought on the soul, it is\nat least arguable that he adopts a unitary view of the soul and its\n“command centre” which is conceptually much closer to the\nStoic one (on this point see Gill 2010). \nYet it is not quite as simple as that. The physical location of the\nother two Platonic soul-parts, spirited and desiderative\n(respectively, heart and liver) are important in\nGalen’s theory of the psychē—and not just of the\npsychē understood as responsible for vital functions. Galen\nis not able to make the same close connection, at least\ndemonstratively (see\n §3.1),\n between these other two bodily locations and their psychological\nfunctions as he is for that of the brain; nevertheless, the fact that\nthe thumoeides—a range of emotional reactions related\nto anger, indignation, shame, pride, anxiety, fear—is located in\nthe heart is shown by a number of examples, both from everyday\nexperience and from traditional thought. \nGalen exemplifies and expounds this view at length in his refutation\nof Chrysippus in PHP II and III; such relationships between\nphysical states and mental ones are also explored in a range of\nmedical texts too (see Singer forthcoming). Galen makes (interestingly\nprecise) attempts at identifying physical correlates for a range of\npsychological or emotional states, in terms of the precise actions and\nstates of heart or blood; yet the texts in question are unclear on the\nprecise nature of the causal (or identity) relationship. Relevant here\ntoo are the medical discussions in which it is clearly implied that\ncertain types of physical state—e.g., excess of melancholic\nhumours—are causative, if not constitutive, of certain mental\nstates. \nThe strongest case for a mind-body identity theory in Galen, however,\nis provided by the discussion of the relationship between rational\nsoul and physical features of the brain, especially in QAM.\nThe central aim of that work is to demonstrate the extent of the\ninfluence of the body, specifically bodily mixture, on the soul; this\nGalen does with examples from medicine (e.g., mental derangements with\nphysical causes) as well as everyday experience (drunkenness, effects\nof physical environment). How, he asks, could a soul which is not\ncorporeal be be affected by such physical factors, and indeed be\ncaused to leave the body as a result of certain physical conditions\n(QAM 3, 381)? In a number of passages, he suggests not just\nthe dependence of the soul on bodily mixture, but the identity of the\ntwo: \nOn this basis, some have taken mind-body identity as representing\nGalen’s final position. A consideration of all the relevant\nevidence, however, leads to a less clear-cut picture. The apparently\nclearest identity statements ((a) and (d) above) come in dialectical\ncontexts; it is at least arguable that Galen is here asserting the\nidentity position not as his own but as the correct\nAristotelian conclusion, on the basis of their equation of\nsoul with form. (It should also be mentioned that the passages in\nquestion are not free from textual and interpretive problems.)\nPassages (b) and (c), meanwhile, clearly affirm the identity of the\nmortal parts of the soul with bodily mixtures. Now, this\ncertainly includes the non-rational parts; but, within this same text,\neven after (d), Galen leaves open the Platonic possibility that the\n(rational) soul is a non-bodily substance. As we have seen\n (§3.4),\n such indeterminacy is consistent with his explicit statements of\nignorance—including in texts later than QAM—on\nthis very question, the “substance of the soul”. (Those\nother statements do not in fact specify that it is only the\nrational soul that is at issue; but, as we have seen, Galen\nmay (somewhat confusingly) use “psychē” with\nthat narrower reference.) Other relevant evidence is the lack of\nclarity, in the medical texts mentioned above, as to the causal\nrelation between mental events and physical correlates; and that some\nkind of interactionist picture seems implied by statements about the\nmutually beneficial relationship of soul and body and of their\nrespective training (especially in San. Tu., e.g., I.8,\n19–21). \nQAM also contains a striking statement of the problem of\nphysical determinism versus moral responsibility: how can someone\nproperly be praised or blamed for character qualities, when these are\nderived not “from himself” but from bodily mixture?\n(QAM 11, 405). This historically distinctive formulation\nseems to rely on a definite and uncompromising physicalist view;\nagain, however, the statement in this form is unique within the\nGalenic corpus. \nAny attempt to summarize Galen’s philosophy in this area risks\nfailing to do justice to his own plurality of formulations. Two\nthings, at least, are uncontentious: that he makes a strong statement\nof the extent to which mental capacities are physically conditioned;\nand that he explores the subject in an empirically and physiologically\ninformed manner unique within Graeco-Roman thought. \nGalen’s theoretical ethics is closely related to his Platonist\nconception of the soul. Central is the view that rational and\nnon-rational psychic capacities must be treated separately, both in\nterms of early discipline and education and in terms of our\nconceptualization and treatment of their pathologies.\nVirtues—although a full or systematic account of these is\nelusive—may be understood, Platonically, as consisting in the\nproper functioning of each soul part, and in the proper internal\nrelationship of the parts within the whole. The non-rational\n(alogon), if not subject to the discipline of the rational,\nwill lead the soul into pathos (“affection” or\n“passion”), causing actions of uncontrolled greed,\nlustfulness or anger. This part is not accessible to rational\ndiscourse, but must rather be subjected to a process of training and\nhabituation which will make its appetites appropriate. Within the\nnon-rational, however, there is the further division into desiderative\n(epithumētikon) and spirited (thumoeides); although\nnon-rational (and in undisciplined cases the cause of uncontrolled\nrage), the latter also has an instinctive reaction of indignation\nagainst wrongdoing and shameful behaviour, and can so be made the ally\nof the rational in carrying out the discipline of the desiderative\npart. (This complex relationship within the tripartite soul\nenables—for Galen as for Plato—an account of how certain\nnon-rational drives, in particular reactions of shame and indignation,\nmay be in conflict with other non-rational drives, e.g., lust or\ngreed.) \nIn Aff. Pecc. Dig., Ind. and Mor., Galen\nstrongly suggests—in a way consistent with Platonic and\nAristotelian perceptions—that early habituation and discipline,\nas well as the right natural endowments, are crucial to the production\nof this appropriate level of desires and right relationship between\nrational and non-rational drives within the soul. (There are also\nquite close Platonic echoes in his commitment to various forms of\nearly mathematical and musical training.) At the same time, he\ndescribes in some detail, especially in Aff. Pecc. Dig. I, a\nprocess of moral self-discipline, involving elements of\n“cognitive therapy”, which may assist even the mature\nperson prone to pathos and to distress to remedy his or her\nfaults. The texts stand within a tradition of works on ethical therapy\nand self-improvement, exemplified by such authors as Plutarch, Marcus\nAurelius, Epictetus and Seneca; they offer a range of practical\napproaches: daily self-monitoring; adjustment of one’s\nexpectations; the co-option of a neutral observer to give an objective\nassessment of the level of one’s faults and of one’s\nprogress. \nThe focus is on the reduction or elimination of one’s\npathē; here, in spite of the Platonist psychological\nframework, Galen is engaging in a discourse developed especially by\nStoic authors, and to some extent adopting their technical language.\nThis observation leads us on to some further consideration of\nGalen’s views and their relationship with the contemporary\nethical discourse. \nA standard point of school conflict in the ethical discourse of\nGalen’s time was that between the Stoic insistence on the need\nfor total eradication of the affections (related to the\ndoctrinal position that any giving-in to pathos is in fact a\nform of madness) and the Platonic-Aristotelian advocacy of a\n“moderate level of affectedness” (metriopatheia).\nIt is perhaps significant that this technical term, employed by\nGalen’s “Middle Platonist” contemporaries, does not\nappear in his own extant ethics; and indeed, much of the discourse of\nboth Aff. Pecc. Dig. and Ind. seems consistent with\nthe aim of eradication of the pathē. On the other\nhand, Galen comes down against the necessity of total eradication,\nespecially in Ind.; here, explicitly engaging with this\nethical question, Galen denies that he could be happy inside the Bull\nof Phalaris (a notorious instrument of torture as well as a stock\nEpicurean philosophical example), and takes issue with the Stoic\nMusonius for his reported welcoming of adversity. \nOn the one hand, Galen imposes very high standards in this area,\nclaiming himself to have been “completely undistressed” by\nthe fire in which he lost a huge number of valuables, including a\nmajor part of his own writings; in another sense, he manifests a\nrealistic and down-to-earth approach, asserting that freedom from\ndistress is possible so long as certain basic human needs are met. He\nacknowledges that certain circumstances might deprive him of his moral\nequilibrium—exile, for example, or injustice visited upon a\nfriend—and hopes not to encounter those. \nThere is a broader point about pathos: in Aristotle the term\nis ethically neutral, referring to emotive or non-rational experience\nquite generally; thus, in the Nicomachean Ethics, virtues may\nbe understood as involving a mean, between an excessive and an\ninadequate emotive response. Both the Aristotelian picture and the\nterm metriopatheia entail an understanding of pathos\nas not in itself negative; Galen’s understanding of\npathos, in the ethical context, seems rather in accord with\nthe Stoic conception: it is in its nature undesirable, to be reduced\nor eliminated as far as possible—even if he does not follow the\nStoics in asserting the necessity, or indeed practicability, of its\ncomplete eradication. \nAgainst this, however, it should be observed that Galen adopts an\nAristotelian-type mean theory in relation to physical\nexcellence; that he suggests, e.g., in QAM, that physical\nstates of good balance will accord with good ethical states, and that\nin at least one passage, in Temp. he invokes something like\nan Aristotelian mean theory in talking of this correspondence between\nphysical and ethical good balance: the soul of the well-balanced man\nwill “be at an exact balance between boldness and cowardice,\nhesitation and rashness, pity and envy” (Temp. II.1,\n233). \nGalen’s approach to the pathē is not systematic, nor\naimed at giving a detailed classification, as were some Stoic\napproaches; however, he does share with the Stoics some classificatory\ntendencies. He identifies what seems to be an over-arching category of\npathos, that of distress (lupē). Distress has\nrelevance to a whole range of individual pathē: grief at\nloss, envy of another’s greater success or wealth, annoyance at\na servant’s careless behaviour, all may be considered either as\ninstances of distress or as giving rise to distress. The ethical\nproject of controlling the pathē can thus to a large extent,\nit seems, be understood as the project of avoidance of distress.\n“Freedom from distress” (alupia)—the title\nof a recently-discovered work which discusses personal experiences and\napproaches to the problem in vivid detail (Ind.)—thus\nbegins to look quite similar to the Stoic aim of\n“unaffectedness” (apatheia). Such unaffectedness\n- with the caveats already made as to its achievability in all\ncases—does indeed seem to be a part of Galen’s ethical\nproject. The desire to free oneself from distress, it is also\nsuggested, may provide a practical starting-point for the\nethical project, for the simple reason that no one actually wishes to\nlive with distress (whereas people may be happy to live with vices\nwhich do not immediately cause this negative experience). \nGalen’s main extant ethical work, Aff. Pecc. Dig.,\nexplicitly addresses itself to the correction of both affections\n(pathē) and errors (hamartēmata)—that is to\nsay, to the shortcomings of both the non-rational and the rational\npart of the soul. Galen is clear that the domain of ethics covers the\nidentification and correction of both; yet in the latter\narea—that of ethical errors of reason—his discussion is\nmuch less clear. He prefers to focus on intellectual error and\ninadequate intellectual training more broadly, in a way which seems\nmore relevant to the discovery of scientific than to that of ethical\ntruth. Relatedly, it is difficult to find in Galen a clear answer to\nthe question of the goal of life, or ultimate good for human beings.\nWhat seems clear is that although he regards freedom from\ndistress—a condition which may seem very similar to Epicurean\n“untroubledness” (ataraxia) or Stoic\n“unaffectedness”—as a highly desirable state, this\nis at best a precondition for the good life, not constitutive of it.\nGalen is committed to the notion that human beings have a\n“higher” good than that implied in the Epicurean ideal;\nand it seems (though there are textual problems in the passages where\nhe comes closest to addressing the question) that the good may be\nformulated (a) in terms of an approach to the divine, and/or (b) in\nterms of the human being’s fulfilment of his or her proper\ncapacities through appropriate activity of body and soul. \nGalen draws on diverse elements in the philosophical tradition, most\nspecifically the Platonic tripartite soul and the Stoic\npathē, to advance his own distinctive ethical position,\nwhich consists of two conceptually separate (though mutually\nreinforcing) elements. First, one’s non-rational drives must be\nsubjected to appropriate discipline—a discipline which, without\nthe unrealistic aim of total eradication of the pathē,\nnonetheless imposes high normative standards. Secondly, the rational\npart of the soul must be properly educated, and must fulfil its\nfunction appropriately; although a clear definition of the “aim\nof life” corresponding to the good of this rational part of the\nsoul is absent (at least from the extant texts), it is at least\nstrongly implied that scientific or intellectual enquiry constitutes\nthe most appropriate, or highest, realm for this fulfilment of its\nfunction. \nThat Galen is some kind of theist is clear. His philosophical theology\nis seen especially in texts such as UP and Foet.\nForm., where he argues that the manifest suitedness of biological\norganisms and individual structures—especially those observed in\nanatomy—to their functions clearly proves their organization by\nsome extraordinary, even divine, intelligence. In line with his\nepistemic caution, however (see\n §3.4\n above), he is not able to be specific about the nature or identity of\nthis divine intelligence. The key feature of Galen’s theology is\nthe role it plays in teleological explanation (although, as we have\nseen, the teleological account is at times presented in quite\nstrikingly anthropomorphic terms). \nYet there are traces of a more specific theological philosophy. The\nview of the heavenly bodies as intelligent appears both in\nQAM and in UP; and although it is presented in\nsomewhat vague terms, it motivates specific philosophical arguments.\nThe heavenly world is transcendently good and superior; yet it has an\ninfluence—at some remove—on our lower world. (The way in\nwhich the heavenly bodies affect our world includes astrological\ninfluence; although this is not a major part of Galen’s thought,\nthe existence of such influence is explicitly asserted, for example in\nDi. Dec.) Consideration of the relationship between the\nheavenly realm and our everyday world leads to two specific types of\nconclusion: one, that our consciousness of the operation of a higher\nintelligence in this lower world should make us aware how much more\nadmirable and perfect must be its operation in that higher one\n(UP XVII.1, 730); two, that there is a problem in imagining\nhow the highest intelligence could “stoop” to affect the\noperations of the lowest level of biological organisms (Foet.\nForm. 6, 201). \nAgain there is the distinction to be made between the essentials about\nwhich Galen is certain—here, that there is a purposive\nintelligence manifest throughout the universe—and the specifics,\nspeculation about which may lead ultimately to aporia. \nGalen also claims to have had personal experience of the interventions\nof specific gods within the Greek polytheistic world (most notably of\nAsclepius, the god of medicine). If it seems difficult to reconcile\nsuch a conventional, anthropomorphic manifestation of religion with\nthe philosophical view of God as a teleological cause or as immanent\nNature, it should perhaps be said that such a co-existence of abstract\ntheology with traditional individual gods is by no means confined to\nGalen, amongst Graeco-Roman philosophical writers (one could mention\nboth Plato and Epictetus in this context). In any case, it is to the\ndivine intelligence manifest throughout the universe, rather than to\nany individual god, that Galen constantly returns; it is this\nintelligence which is the object of his religious—and by the\nsame token of his intellectual, indeed his\nscientific—fervour.","contact.mail":"pn_singer@yahoo.co.uk","contact.domain":"yahoo.co.uk"}]
