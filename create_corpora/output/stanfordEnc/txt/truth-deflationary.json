For \nexample, to say that ‘snow is white’ is true, or that it \nis true that snow is white, is equivalent to saying simply that snow \nis white, and this, according to the deflationary theory, is all that\ncan be said significantly about the truth of ‘snow is \nwhite’.\n\n\n\nThere are many implications of a theory of this sort for \nphilosophical debate about the nature of truth. Philosophers often \nmake suggestions like the following: truth consists in correspondence\nto the facts; truth consists in coherence with a set of beliefs or \npropositions; truth is the ideal outcome of rational inquiry. \nAccording to the deflationist, however, such suggestions are \nmistaken, and, moreover, they all share a common mistake. The common \nmistake is to assume that truth has a nature of the kind \nthat philosophers might find out about and develop theories of. For \nthe deflationist, truth has no nature beyond what is captured in \nordinary claims such as that ‘snow is white’ is true just\nin case snow is white. Philosophers looking for the nature of truth \nare bound to be frustrated, the deflationist says, because they are \nlooking for something that isn't there.\n\n\n\nThe deflationary theory has gone by many different names, including \nat least the following: the redundancy theory, the disappearance \ntheory, the no-truth theory, the disquotational theory, and the \nminimalist theory. There is no terminological consensus about how to \nuse these labels: sometimes they are used interchangeably; sometimes \nthey are used to mark distinctions between different versions of the \nsame general view. Here we will use ‘deflationism’, and \n‘the deflationary theory of truth’ to denote the general \nview we want to discuss, and reserve other names for specific versions\nof that view.\n\n\n\nThe deflationary theory has been one of the most popular approaches \nto truth in the twentieth century, having received explicit defense \nby Frege, Ramsey, Ayer, and Quine, as well as sympathetic treatment \nfrom many others. (According to Dummett 1959, the view originates \nwith Frege.) The following passages all contain recognizable versions\nof the doctrine, though they differ on points of detail.  It is worthy of notice that the sentence ‘I smell the\nscent of violets’ has the same content as the sentence ‘it\nis true that I smell the scent of violets’. So it seems, then,\nthat nothing is added to the thought by my ascribing to it the property\nof truth. (Frege 1918)  Truth and falsity are ascribed primarily to propositions. The \nproposition to which they are ascribed may be either explicitly given\nor described. Suppose first that it is explicitly given; then it is \nevident that ‘It is true that Caesar was murdered’ means \nno more than that Caesar was murdered, and ‘It is false that \nCaesar was murdered’ means no more than Caesar was not \nmurdered. They are phrases which we sometimes use for emphasis or \nstylistic reasons, or to indicate the position occupied by the \nstatement in our argument….In the second case in which the \nproposition is described and not given explicitly we have perhaps \nmore of a problem, for we get statements from which we cannot in \nordinary language eliminate the words ‘true’ or \n‘false’. Thus if I say ‘He is always right’, \nI mean that the propositions he asserts are always true, and there \ndoes not seem to be any way of expressing this without using the word\n‘true’. But suppose we put it thus ‘For all \np, if he asserts p, p is true’, then\nwe see that the propositional function p is true is simply \nthe same as p, as e.g. its value ‘Caesar was murdered \nis true’ is the same as ‘Caesar was murdered’. \n(Ramsey 1927) …it is evident that a sentence of the form \"p is \ntrue\" or \"it is true that p\" the reference to truth never \nadds anything to the sense. If I say that it is true that Shakespeare\nwrote Hamlet, or that the proposition \"Shakespeare wrote \nHamlet\" is true, I am saying no more than that Shakespeare \nwrote Hamlet. Similarly, if I say that it is false that \nShakespeare wrote the Iliad, I am saying no more than that \nShakespeare did not write the Iliad. And this shows that the\nwords ‘true’ and ‘false’ are not used to \nstand for anything, but function in the sentence merely as assertion \nand negation signs. That is to say, truth and falsehood are not \ngenuine concepts. Consequently there can be no logical problem \nconcerning the nature of truth. (Ayer 1935). \nThe truth predicate is a reminder that, despite a\ntechnical ascent to talk of sentences, our eye is on the world. This\ncancellatory force of the truth predicate is explicit in Tarski's\nparadigm: Quotation marks make all the difference between talking about words \nand talking about snow. The quotation is a name of a sentence that \ncontains a name, namely ‘snow’, of snow. By calling the \nsentence true, we call snow white. The truth predicate is a device \nfor disquotation. (Quine 1970). \n\nIn addition to being popular historically, the deflationary theory has\nbeen the focus of much recent work. Perhaps its most vociferous\ncontemporary defenders are Hartry Field and Paul Horwich.  \n\nOne reason for the popularity of deflationism is its \nanti-metaphysical stance. Deflationism seems to deflate a grand \nmetaphysical puzzle, a puzzle about the nature of truth, and much of \nmodern philosophy is marked by a profound scepticism of metaphysics. \nAnother reason for the popularity of deflationism concerns the fact \nthat truth is a semantic notion, and therefore takes its place along \nwith other semantic notions, such as reference, meaning, and content.\nMany philosophers are concerned with trying to understand these \nsemantic notions. The deflationary theory is attractive since it \nsuggests that, at least in the case of truth, there is less to be \npuzzled about here than one might expect. \n\nPerhaps because of the widespread interest in deflationism, the \ntheory has received many different formulations. The result is that \nthere is not so much a deflationary theory of truth as many.\nIn recent times, however, the deflationary theory has most often been\npresented with the help of a schema, which is sometimes called \nthe equivalence schema: \n\nIn this schema angle brackets indicate an appropriate name-forming \ndevice, e.g. quotation marks or ‘the proposition that \n…’, and occurrences of ‘p’ are \nreplaced with sentences to yield instances of the schema. With the \nhelp of (ES), we can formulate deflationism as the view, roughly, \nthat the instances of this schema capture everything significant that\ncan be said about truth. Theories which depart from deflationism deny\nthat the equivalence schema tells us the whole truth about truth. \nSince such theories add to the equivalence schema, they are often \ncalled inflationary theories of truth. (The equivalence schema is \nassociated with Alfred Tarski (1944, 1958), but it is far from \nobvious that Tarski was any sort of deflationist. We will largely set\nTarski aside here.)  \n\nFormulated in this way, deflationism does not give an \nexplicit definition of truth, for (ES) is not a definition \nof anything. Indeed, some deflationists (most notably Horwich 1998b) \ndo not provide an explicit definition of truth at all. Instead, they \nprovide an explicit definition of having the concept of truth. To be \nmore precise, the suggestion is that someone has the concept of truth\njust in case he or she is disposed to accept all (noncontroversial) \ninstances of the equivalence schema, i.e., every sentence of the form\n‘<p> is true if and only if p’ \nthat is not paradoxical or in some other way deviant. Of course, such\ndeflationists may think that, in saying something about what it is to\nhave the concept of truth, they have told us what the concept of \ntruth is. But the latter is a by-product of the former; for this \nreason, we can say that these deflationists are proposing an implicit\ndefinition of the concept of truth.  \n\nAre there versions of deflationism, or positions allied to \ndeflationism, which do not employ the equivalence schema or some \nsimilar device? Yes, but we shall mention them here only to set them \naside. One such view — which may be called \nexpressivism — is the analogue of emotivism in ethics.\n(This view of truth is often associated with Strawson 1950, though \nthe attribution is a difficult one.) According to emotivism, at least\nin one of its most traditional forms, utterances of the form \n‘torture is wrong’ do not, despite appearances, predicate\n‘is wrong’ of torture; rather utterances of \n‘torture is wrong’ merely indicate a negative attitude on\nthe part of the speaker toward torture. Expressivism is the parallel \nposition about truth. According to expressivism, utterances of the \nform ‘S is true’ do not, despite appearances, \npredicate ‘is true’ of S; rather \n‘S is true’ merely indicates preparedness on the\npart of the speaker to assert S. \n\nAnother such view is the prosentential theory of truth \nadvanced by Dorothy Grover (see Grover, Camp and Belnap 1973, and \nGrover 1992) . According to this theory, sentences formed with the \npredicate ‘is true’ are prosentences, where a \nprosentence is a device for achieving anaphoric cross-reference to \nsentences uttered previously in a conversation, just as pronouns are \ndevices for achieving anaphoric cross-reference to names uttered \npreviously in a conversation. According to the prosentential theory, \nfor example, just as in \n\nwe interpret ‘she’ as a pronoun anaphorically dependent on\n‘Mary’, so too in  \n\nwe interpret ‘That is true’ as a prosentence anaphorically\ndependent on ‘Snow is white’.  \n\nExpressivism and the prosentential theory are close cousins of \ndeflationism, and, in some uses of the term, might reasonably be \ncalled deflationary. However, they are also sufficiently different \nfrom those versions of deflationism that utilize the equivalence \nschema to be set aside here. The important difference between \nexpressivism and the prosentential theory on the one hand, and \ndeflationism as we are understanding it on the other, concerns the \nlogical structure of sentences such as ‘S is \ntrue’. For the deflationist, the structure of such sentences is\nvery straightforward: ‘S is true’ \npredicates the property expressed by ‘is true’ of the \nthing denoted by ‘S’. We might express this by \nsaying that, according to deflationism, ‘S is \ntrue’ says of S that it is true, just as \n‘apples are red’ says, of apples, that they are \nred or ‘John sleeps’ says, of John, that he \nsleeps. Both expressivism and the prosentential theory deny this, \nthough for different reasons. According to expressivism, \n‘S is true’ is properly interpreted not even of \nsubject-predicate form; rather it has the structure ‘Hooray to \nS’. Obviously, therefore, it does not say, of\nS, that it is true. According to prosententialism, by \ncontrast, while ‘S is true’ has a \nsubject-predicate structure, it would still be mistaken to interpret \nit as being about S. For consider: according to the \nprosentential theory, ‘S is true’ is a \nprosentence which stands in for the sentence denoted by S \njust as ‘she’ in (1) is a pronoun which stands in for the\nname ‘Mary’. But we do not say that ‘she’ in \n(1) is about the name ‘Mary’; similarly, \naccording to the prosentential theory, we should not say that \n‘S is true’ is about S. To suppose \notherwise would be to misconstrue the nature of anaphora. \n\nDifferent interpretations of the equivalence schema yield different \nversions of deflationism.  \n\nOne important question concerns the issue of what instances of the \nequivalence schema are assumed to be about (equivalently: to what the\nnames in instances of the equivalence schema are assumed to refer). \nAccording to one view, instances of the equivalence schema are about \nsentences, where a name for a sentence can be formulated simply by \nquoting the sentence — thus \"‘Brutus killed \nCaesar’\" is a name for ‘Brutus killed Caesar’. In \nother words, for those who hold what might be called a \nsententialist version of deflationism the equivalence schema\nhas instances like (3): \n\nTo make this explicit, we might say that, according to sententialism,\nthe equivalence schema is (ES-sent):  \n\nNotice that in this schema, the angle-brackets of (ES) have been \nreplaced by quotation marks. \n\nAccording to those who hold what might be called a \npropositionalist version of deflationism, by contrast, \ninstances of the equivalence schema are about propositions, where \nnames of propositions are, or can be taken to be, expressions of the \nform ‘the proposition that p’ — thus, \n‘the proposition that Brutus killed Caesar’ is a name for\nthe proposition that Brutus killed Caesar. For the propositionalist, \nin other words, instances of the equivalence schema are properly \ninterpreted not as being about sentences but about propositions, \ni.e., more like (4) than (3):  \n\nTo make this explicit, we might say that, according to \npropositionalism, the equivalence schema is (ES-prop):  \n\nTo interpret the equivalence schema as (ES-sent) rather than \n(ES-prop), or vice versa, is to yield a different deflationary theory\nof truth. Hence sententialism and propositionalism are different \nversions of deflationism. (There are also some further ways to \ninterpret the equivalence schema, but we shall set them aside here.)  \n\nThe other dimension along which deflationary theories vary concerns \nthe nature of the equivalence that the theories interpret instances \nof the equivalence schema as asserting. On one view, the right hand \nside and the left hand side of such instances are analytically \nequivalent. Thus, for sententialists, (3) asserts that, \n\"‘Brutus killed Caesar’ is true\" means the same as \n‘Brutus killed Caesar’; while for propositionalists (4) \nasserts that ‘the proposition that Brutus killed Caesar is \ntrue’ means the same as ‘Brutus killed Caesar’. A \nsecond view is that the right hand side and the left hand side of \nclaims such as (3) and (4) are only materially equivalent; this view \ninterprets the ‘if and only if’ in both (3) and (4) as \nthe biconditional of classical logic. And a third view is that claims\nsuch as (3) and (4) assert a necessary equivalence between their \nright hand sides and their left hand sides; that is, both (3) and (4)\nare to be interpreted as material biconditionals that hold of \nnecessity. \n\nThis tripartite distinction between analytic, necessary, and material\nequivalence, when combined with the distinction between sententialism\nand propositionalism, yields six different versions of deflationism: \n\nIt is this variegated nature of deflationism that to a large extent \ndictates the many names that have been used for the theory. The \nlabels ‘redundancy theory’, ‘disappearance \ntheory’ and ‘no-truth theory’ have been used mainly\nto apply to analytic versions of deflationism: positions \nA or B. The label \n‘disquotational theory’ tends to apply to sententialist \nversions, and in fact to material sentential deflationism: position \nC. The label ‘minimalist theory’ is a \nlabel used recently by Paul Horwich (1998b) to apply to necessary \nversions, and in fact to necessary propositional deflationism: \nposition F. It will not be important for us to \nexamine all of these versions of deflationism in detail; to a large \nextent philosophers prefer one or other versions of these views on \nthe basis of views from other parts of philosophy, views about the \nphilosophy of language and metaphysics. However, it will be \nconvenient here to settle on one version of the view. We will \ntherefore follow Horwich in concentrating mainly on position \nF. Horwich calls this view ‘minimalism’,\nbut we will continue simply with ‘deflationism’. \n\nThe deflationist idea that the equivalence schema (ES-prop) provides \nan implicit definition of the concept of truth suggests that truth \nis, as the label ‘redundancy theory’ suggests, a \nredundant concept, a concept that we could do without. On the \ncontrary, however, advocates of the deflationary theory (particularly\nthose influenced by Ramsey) are at pains to point out that anyone who\nhas the concept of truth in this sense is in possession of a very \nuseful concept indeed; in particular, anyone who has this concept is \nin a position to form generalizations that would otherwise require \nlogical devices of infinite conjunction.  \n\nSuppose, for example, that Jones for whatever reason decides that \nSmith is an infallible guide to the nature of reality. We might then \nsay that Jones believes everything Smith says. To say this much, \nhowever, is not to capture the content of Jones's belief. In order to\ndo that we need some way of expressing an infinite conjunction of \nsomething like the following form: \n\nThe equivalence schema (ES-prop) allows us to capture this infinite\nconjunction. For, on the basis of the schema, we can reformulate the\ninfinite conjunction as:  \n\nIn turn, this reformulated infinite conjunction can be expressed as a\nstatement whose universal quantifier ranges over propositions:  \n\nOr, to put the same thing more colloquially:  \n\nThis statement give us the content of Jones's belief. And the \nimportant point for deflationists is that we could not have stated \nthe content of this belief unless we had the concept of truth as \ndescribed by the deflationary theory. In fact, for most \ndeflationists, it is this feature of the concept of truth — its\nrole in the formation of generalizations — that explains why we\nhave a concept of truth at all. This is, as it is often put, the \nraison d'être of the concept of truth. \n\nGiven deflationists place such heavy emphasis on the role of the \nconcept of truth in expressing generalizations, it is ironic that \nsome versions of deflationism have been criticized for being \nconstitutionally incapable of accounting for generalizations about \ntruth (Gupta 1993, Halbach 1999, Soames 1999, Armour-Garb \n2004). For example, theories that implicitly define truth using only \nthe instances of (ES-prop) do not allow us to derive a generalization\nlike (Conjunction).  \n\nSince the instances of (ES-prop) are a collection of particular \npropositions and (Conjunction) is a universal generalization, it is \nnot possible to derive (Conjunction) from the instances of (ES-prop).\nYet it is plausible that a theory of truth should allow us to derive \ngeneral truths about truth, like (Conjunction). This suggests that \ndeflationary theories of truth formulated using only the instances of\n(ES-prop) are inadequate.  \n\nIt is for this reason that some deflationists use a version of (Gen) \nto formulate their theory of truth.  \n\nThere are two things to notice about (Gen). First, unlike (ES-prop) \nit is not a schema, but a universally quantified formula. For this \nreason, it is possible to derive (Conjunction) from it. That (Gen) is\nuniversally quantified also means it can be used as an explicit \ndefinition of truth. So although deflationists often only implicitly \ndefine truth, it is possible for a deflationist to offer an explicit \ndefinition. Thus we have another dimension along which deflationary \ntheories can vary.  \n\nSecond, the existential quantifier in (Gen) must be a higher-order \nquantifier that quantifies into sentential position. Wolfgang \nKünne (2003) takes the existential quantifier to be an objectual\n(domain and values) quantifier ranging over propositions. A different\napproach would be to take the existential quantifier as a \nsubstitutional quantifier where the substitution class consists of \nsentences. Christopher Hill (2002) offers a further, idiosyncratic, \nalternative and treats the existential quantifier as a substitutional\nquantifier whose substitution class is the set of all propositions. \nHowever, all these approaches have drawn criticism on the grounds \nthat the use of higher-order quantifiers to define truth is circular \n(Platts 1980, Horwich 1998b, McGrath 2000), and may get the extension\nof the concept of truth wrong (Sosa 1993). Unfortunately, we cannot \nassess these criticisms here. We shall continue to concentrate mainly\non those versions of deflationism formulated using instances of \n(ES-prop).  \n\nAn alternative deflationist approach to the generalization problem is\nto attempt to show that, despite appearances, theories that only \nappeal to the instances of (ES-prop) nevertheless do have the \nresources to derive the problematic generalizations. Field (1994a), \nfor example, suggests that we allow reasoning with schemas and \nproposes rules that would allow the derivation of generalizations. \nHorwich (1998b) suggests a more informal approach according to which \nwe are justified in deriving (Conjunction) since an informal \ninspection of a derivation of some instance of (Conjunction) shows us\nthat we could derive any instance of it.  \n\nIt is commonly said that, according to the deflationary theory, truth\nis not a property and therefore that, according to the theory, if a \nproposition is true, it is mistaken to say that the proposition has a\nproperty, the property of being true. There is something right and \nsomething wrong about this view, and to see what is wrong and right \nabout it will help us to understand the deflationary theory.  \n\nConsider the two true propositions (5) and (6): \n\n(6) The earth revolves around the sun. \n\nDo these propositions share a property of being true? Well, in one \nsense of course they do: since they are both true, we can say that \nthere both have the property of being true. In this sense, the \ndeflationary theory is not denying that truth is a property: truth is\nthe property that all true propositions have.  \n\nOn the other hand, when we say that two things share a property \nF, we often mean more than simply that they are both \nF; we mean in addition that there is intuitively a common \nexplanation as to why they are both F. It is in this second \nsense in which deflationists are denying that truth is a property. \nThus, in the case of our example, what explains the truth of (5) is \nthat Caracas is the capital of Venezuela; and what explains this is \nthe political history of Venezuela. On the other hand, what explains \nthe truth of (6) is that the earth revolves around the sun; and what \nexplains this is the nature of the solar system. The nature of the \nsolar system, however, has nothing to do with the political history \nof Venezuela (or if it does the connections are completely \naccidental!) and to that extent there is no shared explanation as to \nwhy (5) and (6) are both true. Therefore, in this stronger sense, \nthey have no property in common. \n\nIt will help to bring out the contrast being invoked here if we \nconsider two properties that have nothing to do with truth, the \nproperty of being, i.e. the property of having existence, and the \nproperty of being a mammal. Consider Hillary Rodham Clinton and the \nGreat Wall of China. Do these objects have the property of existence?\nWell, in one sense, they do: they both exist so they both have the \nproperty of existence. On the other hand, however, there is no common\nexplanation as to why they both exist. What explains the existence of\nthe Great Wall is the architectural and defense policies of classical\nChina; what explains the existence of Hillary Rodham Clinton is Mr \nand Mrs Rodham. We might then say that existence is not a property \nand mean by this that it does not follow from the fact that two \nthings exist that there is a common explanation as to why they exist.\nBut now compare the property of existence with the property of being \na mammal. If two things are mammals, they have the property of being \na mammal, but in addition there is some common explanation as to why \nthey are both mammals — both are descended from the same family\nof creatures, say. According to deflationism, the property of being \ntrue is more like the property of existence than it is like the \nproperty of being a mammal. \n\nDepending on one's views about what it takes to be a property, then, \none might be tempted to say here that being true is not a property, \nbecause it is not like being a mammal. But in fact most contemporary \ndeflationists, pursuing the analogy between truth and existence, \ndescribe truth as a logical property (for example, Field 1992: 322; \nHorwich 1998a: 37; Künne 2003: 91). \n\nTruth and falsity are a package deal. It would be hard to imagine \nsomeone having the concept of truth without also having the concept \nof falsity. One obvious question to ask the proponent of the \ndeflationary theory of truth, then, is how the theory is to be \nextended to falsity.  \n\nA natural account of the concept of falsity defines it in terms of \nthe concept of truth. Thus, someone has the concept of falsehood just\nin case they accept instances of the schema: \n\nA second, and initially slightly different, account of falsity \ndefines it directly in terms of negation. According to this view, \nsomeone has the concept of falsity just in case they accept instances\nof the schema:  \n\nMany deflationists suppose that that (F-prop) and (F-prop*) in fact \nimplicitly define the same concept of falsity (cf Horwich 1994). The \nkey idea here is that there seems no reason to distinguish being \ntrue from being the case. If there is no distinction \nbetween being true and being the case, presumably there is also no \ndistinction between ‘It is not the case that p’ \nand ‘It is not true that p’. In addition, \nhowever, ‘It is not true that p’ is plausibly \nsynonymous with ‘the proposition that p is not \ntrue’; and this means that (F-prop) and (F-prop*) are \nequivalent. As we will shortly see, this account of falsity, though \ncertainly a natural one, leaves the deflationary theory open to an \nimportant objection concerning truth-value gaps.  \n\nOur concern to this point has been only with what the deflationary \ntheory is. In the remainder of this article, we consider six \nobjections. These are by no means the only objections that have been \nadvanced against deflationism — Horwich (1998b) considers \nthirty-nine different objections! — but they do seem \nparticularly obvious and important.  \n\nWe noted earlier that deflationism can be presented in either a \nsententialist version or a propositionalist version. Some \nphilosophers have suggested, however, that the choice between these \ntwo versions constitutes a dilemma for deflationism (Jackson, Oppy \nand Smith 1994). The objection is that if deflationism is construed \nin accordance with propositionalism, then it is trivial, but if it is\nconstrued in accordance with sententialism it is false. To illustrate\nthe dilemma, consider the following claim:  \n\nNow, does snow is white refer to a sentence or a \nproposition? If, on the one hand, we take (7) to be about a sentence,\nthen, assuming (7) can be interpreted as making a necessary claim, \n(7) is false. On the face of it, after all, it takes a lot more than \nsnow's being white for it to be the case that ‘snow is \nwhite’ is true. In order that ‘snow is white’ be \ntrue, it must be the case not only that snow is white, it must in \naddition be the case that ‘snow is white’ means \nthat snow is white. But this is a fact about language that (7) \nignores. On the other hand, suppose we take snow is white to\ndenote a proposition; in particular, suppose we take it to denote the\nproposition that snow is white. Then the theory looks to be trivial, \nsince the proposition that snow is white is defined as being true \njust in case snow is white. In short, the deflationist is faced with \na dilemma: take deflationism to be a theory of sentences and it is \nfalse; take it to be a theory of propositions, on the other hand, and\nit is trivial.  \n\nOf the two horns of this dilemma, it might seem that the best \nstrategy for deflationists is to remain with the propositionalist \nversion of their doctrine and accept its triviality. A trivial \ndoctrine, after all, at least has the advantage of being true. \nMoreover, the charge of triviality is something that deflationists \nmight well be expected to wear as a badge of honor: since \ndeflationists are advocating their theory as following from mundane \nfacts about which everyone can agree, it is no wonder that the theory\nthey advocate is trivial. \n\nHowever, there are a number of reasons why deflationists have \ntypically not endorsed this option. First, the triviality at issue \nhere does not have its source in the concept of truth, but rather in \nthe concept of a proposition. Second, a trivial version of \ndeflationism says nothing about the theory of meaning, where by \n‘theory of meaning’ we mean an account of the connections\nbetween sentences of natural language and the propositions they \nexpress. After all, if deflationists are attending only to \npropositions, they are evidently not attending to the \nrelation between sentences and propositions. Of course, one might \npoint out that other theories of truth are also silent on the theory \nof meaning — why then can deflationism not be? However, the \nfact is that many deflationists present their doctrine as a central \npart of a much bigger philosophical project, viz., to provide a \ndeflationary account of all the semantic notions, that is, notions \nsuch as truth, reference, and meaning. The problem for deflationists \nwho grasp the second horn of the dilemma is that they must admit that\nthere is no way to complete this project: the deflationary theory of \ntruth can only be maintained by remaining silent about the theory of \nmeaning. And this means that deflationism should be understood as a \nmuch more modest project than it is often taken to be. \n\nThe other possible response to this dilemma is to accept that \ndeflationism applies inter alia to sentences, but to argue that the \nsentences to which it applies must be interpreted sentences,\ni.e., sentences which have meaning. Of course, if the sentences to \nwhich deflationism applies are interpreted sentences, then there will\nbe no force to the objection that deflationism is ignoring the fact \nthat sentences have meaning. Deflationism, on this interpretation, is\nnot so much ignoring this fact as assuming it. \n\nOn either plausible response to the dilemma, then, the deflationist \nmakes use of the notion of meaning to explain truth. This fact has \nled a number of philosophers to argue that, on pain of circularity, \ndeflationism cannot be combined with theories of meaning that make \nuse of the notion of truth to explain meaning — in particular, \nthat deflationism is incompatible with truth-conditional theories of \nmeaning (e.g. Dummett 1959, Davidson 1990, Horwich 1998b, Kalderon \n1999, Collins 2002). Other philosophers have also suggested that \ndeflationism is incompatible with truth-conditional theories of \nmeaning on the grounds that granting truth any kind of \nexplanatory role is inconsistent with deflationism (Davidson 1990, \nField 1986, 1994).  \n\nIf deflationism is inconsistent with truth-conditional theories of \nmeaning, this is not obviously an objection to deflationism.\nAfter all, there are alternative theories of meaning available: both \nPaul Horwich and Hartry Field have in different ways defended a \nversion of a use theory of meaning (see Field 1994a, Horwich 1998a). \nThere is, however, a lot of work to be done before a use theory can \nbe regarded as a successful theory of meaning.  \n\nWhat about the claim that deflationism is inconsistent with\ntruth-conditional theories of meaning? As William G. Lycan notes\n(Bar-On et al 2005), the charges of circularity in the literature have\nbeen impressionistic and so remain difficult to evaluate.  Moreover,\non the surface at least, the circularity charge would seem to show\nthat even inflationism about truth is inconsistent with\ntruth-conditional theories of meaning, since all theories of truth\nwill have to take meaning for granted in some sense — for\nexample, in deciding which sentences are truth-apt (For criticisms of\nthe circularity charge, see Gupta 1993, Horisk 2008, Lance 1997,\nWilliams 1999.)  \n\nOn the other hand, worries about the explanatory role truth plays in \ntruth-conditional theories of meaning can only be evaluated if we \nknow, first, what sort of explanatory role truth plays in such \ntheories, and, second, what sort of explanatory roles are ruled out \nby deflationism. It seems clear, for example, that if the concept of \ntruth is only employed in truth-conditional theories of meaning as a \ndevice of generalization, there is no inconsistency with deflationary\ntheories of truth. But does truth have only this role in \ntruth-conditional theories of meaning? The compatibility of \ndeflationism about truth and truth-conditional theories of meaning \nseems to us an important and unanswered question. (For recent \ndiscussion, see Williams 1999, Bar-On et al 2005, Collins 2002, Gupta\nand Martinez-Fernandez 2005, Horisk 2007 and Field 2005.)  \n\nIt is often said that what is most obvious about truth is that truth \nconsists in correspondence to the facts — for example, that the\ntruth of the proposition that the earth revolves around the sun \nconsists in its correspondence to the fact that the earth revolves \naround the sun. The so-called correspondence theory of truth is built\naround this intuition, and tries to explain the notion of truth by \nappeal to the notions of correspondence and fact. Even if one does \nnot build one's theory of truth around this intuition \nhowever, many philosophers regard it as a condition of adequacy on \nany theory of truth that the theory accommodates the correspondence \nintuition.  \n\nIt is often objected to deflationism, however, that the doctrine has \nparticular trouble meeting this adequacy condition. One way to bring \nout the problem here is by focusing on a particular articulation of \nthe correspondence intuition, an articulation favoured by \ndeflationists themselves (Horwich 1998b). According to this way of \nspelling it out, the intuition that a certain sentence or proposition\n‘corresponds to the facts’ is the intuition that the \nsentence or proposition is true because of a certain way the\nworld is; that is, the truth of the proposition is explained\nby some contingent fact which is usually external to the proposition \nitself. We might express this by saying that someone who endorses the\ncorrespondence intuition so understood would endorse: \n\nNow, the problem with (8) is that, when we combine it with the\ndeflationary theory-or at least with a necessary version of that\ntheory-we can derive something that is plainly false. Someone who holds\na necessary version of deflationism would clearly be committed to the\nnecessary truth of:  \n\nAnd, since (9) is a necessary truth, it is very plausible to suppose\nthat (8) and (9) together entail:  \n\nUnfortunately, however, (10) is false. The reason is that the relation\nreported by ‘because’ in (8) and (10) is a causal or\nexplanatory relation, and such relations must obtain between distinct\nrelata. But the relata in (10) are (obviously) not distinct. Hence (10)\nis false. But this means that the conjunction of (8) and (9) must be\nfalse, and that deflationism is inconsistent with the correspondence\nintuition. To borrow a phrase of Mark Johnston's — who mounts a\nsimilar argument in a different context — we might put the point\ndifferently by saying that, if deflationism is true, then what seems to\nbe a perfectly good explanation in (8) goes missing; if\ndeflationism is true, after all, then (8) is equivalent to (10), and\n(10) is not an explanation of anything.  \n\nHow might a deflationist respond to this objection? One response is \nto provide a different articulation of the correspondence intuition. \nFor example, one might point out that the connection between the \nproposition that snow is white and snow's being white is not a \ncontingent connection, and suggest that this rules out (8) as a \nsuccessful articulation of the correspondence intuition. That \nintuition (one might continue) is more plausibly given voice by (8*): \n\nHowever, when (8*) is conjoined with (9), one cannot derive the\nproblematic (10), and thus, one might think, the objection from\ncorrespondence might be avoided. Now certainly this is a possible\nsuggestion; the problem with it, however, is that a deflationist who\nthinks that (8*) is true is most plausibly construed as holding a\nsententialist, rather than a propositionalist, version of deflationism.\nA sententialist version of deflationism, on the other hand, will in\nturn supply a version of (9), viz.:  \n\nwhich, at least it is interpreted as a necessary truth, will conspire\nwith (8*) to yield (10). And we are back where we started.  \n\nAnother response would be to object that ‘because’ \ncreates an opaque context — that is, the kind of context within \nwhich one cannot substitute co-referring expressions and preserve \ntruth. If ‘because’ creates an opaque context, then it \nwould be illegitimate to suppose that (8) and (9) entail (10). This \ntoo is a possibility; however, it is not clear that \n‘because’ creates opaque context of the right kind. In \ngeneral we can distinguish two kinds of opaque context: intensional \ncontexts, which allow the substitution of necessarily co-referring \nexpressions but not contingently co-referring expressions; and \nhyper-intensional contexts, which do not even allow the substitution \nof necessarily co-referring expressions. If the inference from (8) \nand (9) to (10) is to be successfully blocked, it is necessary that \n‘because’ creates a hyper-intensional context. However, \nit is open to a friend of the correspondence objection to argue that,\nwhile ‘because’ creates an intensional context, it does \nnot create a hyper-intensional context. \n\nA final, and most radical, response would be to reject the \ncorrespondence intuition outright. This response is not in fact as \ndrastic as it sounds. In particular, the deflationist does not have \nto say that someone who says ‘the proposition that snow is \nwhite corresponds to the facts’ is speaking falsely. \nDeflationists would do better to say that such a person is simply \nusing a picturesque or ornate way of saying that the proposition is \ntrue, where truth is understood in accordance with the deflationary \ntheory. Indeed, the deflationist can even agree that for certain \nrhetorical or conversational purposes, it might be more effective to \nuse the ‘correspondence to the facts’ talk. Nevertheless,\nit is important to see that this response does involve a burden, \nsince it involves rejecting a condition of adequacy that many regard \nas binding on a theory of truth \n\nPhilosophy of language has isolated a class of propositions that are \nsupposed to fail of truth-value. According to some moral \nphilosophers, for example, moral propositions — such as the \ninjunction that one ought to return people's phone calls — are \nneither true nor false. The same thing is true, according to some \nphilosophers of language, about propositions which presuppose the \nexistence of something which does not in fact exist — such as \nthe claim that the present King of France is bald; about propositions\nthat are vague — such as the proposition that wall hangings are\nfurniture; and about propositions that are paradoxical, such as those\nthat arise in connection with the liar paradox. Let us call this \nthesis the gap, since it finds a gap in the class of propositions \nbetween those that are true and those that are false.  \n\nThe deflationary theory of truth is inconsistent with there being a \ngap in the class of propositions, and this has been thought by many \nto be an objection to the theory. The reason for the inconsistency is\nvery simple, and flows directly from the deflationist theory of \nfalsity that we considered earlier. Suppose, for reductio, that the \ngap is correct and thus that there is a proposition Q which \nlacks a truth-value. Obviously, since Q lacks a truth-value,\nit is not the case that it is true or false. But now consider the \nequivalence schema (F-prop): \n\nIt is clear from (F-prop) that if it is not the case that Q \nis true or false, then it is not the case that Q is true or \nnot true. But that is a contradiction: it must be the case that \nQ is true or not true. We have been led to this \ncontradiction by accepting the following: the claims that all the \ninstances of (ES-prop) and (F-prop) are true, the gap, and classical \nlogic. Clearly, then, we must give up one of these things. But which?\nAnd which can we give up consistently with deflationism?  \n\nOne strategy that is obviously consistent with deflationism is the \nrejection of classical logic (perhaps rejecting or restricting the \nlaw of excluded middle, for example). We shall largely ignore this \napproach here. Another strategy would be to restrict (ES-prop), so \nthat it is not asserted that all instances of (ES-prop) are true \n(Horwich 1998b). However, there are reasons to be suspicious of such \na restriction. To see this, consider the following two propositions:  \n\nBoth (11) and (12) are generalizations we express with the help of \nthe truth predicate. And yet both seem to require the truth of all \ninstances of (ES-prop). In particular, we may use (12) as a way of \nacknowledging our agreement with everything the Pope said, even if \nsome of the propositions he asserted were moral propositions. This \nsuggests that we need to use a notion of truth according to which \ninstances of (ES-prop) hold even for moral statements, and even if \nthey are neither true nor false. \n\nA third strategy modifies deflationism by jettisoning the account of \nfalsity that the deflationist offers, while hanging on to the account\nof truth. This strategy is a fairly desperate one, however. To begin \nwith, if we give up the account of falsehood, it is not clear that we\nhave an account of truth. Truth and falsehood are, as we have said, a\npackage deal. Moreover, the deflationary theories of falsity that we \nconsidered are motivated in large part by classical logic. \nPresumably, it would be desirable to maintain classical logic if at \nall possible, and this means that we should maintain the deflationist\naccount of falsity. Finally, one can generate a problem for the gap \neven if we operate without falsity, and only with truth (Rescher \n1969). Suppose, again for reductio, that there is a proposition \nQ that is neither true nor false. Now, if Q is \nneither true nor false, then the proposition that Q is true \nwill be false. But this means that for at least one instance of the \nequivalence schema, one side of the biconditional will be false, and \nthe other side will be neither true nor false. On all logics that \ninvolve truth-value gaps, however, such a biconditional will be \ncounted either as false or else as neither true nor false. Either \nway, the result is that the equivalence schema is not true in all \ninstances. \n\nA fourth strategy argues that the gap, as we have presented it, is \nmalformed. According to this strategy, one should not respond to the \nphenomena that prompt the gap by suggesting that certain propositions\nlack truth values; one should rather suggest that certain declarative\nsentences lack truth values, i.e., because they fail to express \npropositions at all. Thus, if we take presupposition failure as our \nexample, the suggestion is that instead of supposing that the \nproposition that the present King of France is bald does not\nhave a truth value if the King of France does not exist, one should \nrather suppose that the sentence ‘the present King of France is\nbald’ does not express a proposition, and therefore fails to \nhave a truth value. This kind of approach removes any conflict \nbetween the gap and deflationism. The gap says, or implies, that \ncertain sentences fail to express propositions; deflationism says, or\nimplies, that if those sentences did express propositions, \nthey would have truth values. But there is clearly no contradiction \nin supposing, on the one hand, that a certain sentence fails to \nexpress a proposition and, on the other, that if it did, it would \nhave a truth value. \n\nThis strategy for dealing with the gap returns us to the problems we \nmentioned earlier concerning which theories of meaning are compatible\nwith deflationism. For example, some have argued that deflationism is\nincompatible with truth-conditional theories of meaning and so cannot\naccept that some declarative sentences do not have truth-conditions \nor express propositions (e.g. Field 1994a, Armour-Garb 2001). Even if\nthis is true, however, the deflationist can maintain that only \nmeaningful declarative sentences have truth-conditions or \nexpress a proposition and that a use theory of meaning will \ndistinguish the meaningful sentences from the meaningless. Still, it \nis unclear whether any use theory of meaning can make the appropriate\ndistinctions — for example, whether it can distinguish \n‘The present King of France is bald’ from ‘The \npresent Prime Minister of Australia is bald’.  \n\nA fifth strategy is to reject the gap entirely, and to simply agree \nthat there is no gap that divides either propositions or sentences. \nThis may initially seem to be an overreaction to the inconsistency of\ndeflationism and the gap; however, what lies behind this strategy is \nthe thought that it is not clear that the various phenomena that \nmotivate the gap ought to be regarded as phenomena which involve \nfailure of truth value, whether of sentences or propositions. In the \ncase of presupposition failure, for example, it is not clear that the\nproblem is best explained by a failure of certain sentences to have \ntruth values, or by the presence of conventional or conversational \nimplicatures that govern utterances of those sentences. The \npossibility of a broadly pragmatic account of the phenomena suggests \nthat one might accommodate the intuitions behind the gap without \nsupposing that there is a gap in the class of propositions (for an \nexample, see Stalnaker 1975). Similarly, in the case of vague \npropositions, one might adopt epistemicism: the position that vague \nwords like ‘bald’ in fact have precise extensions, but \nthat we can never know what these precise extensions are (see \nWilliamson 1994, Horwich 1998b). Like the previous strategy, however,\nmore work is required to show that this approach is able to account \nfor the various linguistic phenomena that prompt the gap. \n\nA final strategy for dealing with the gap takes seriously the \ndeflationist idea that attributions of truth to a proposition have \nthe same semantic value as the propositions to which truth is \nattributed. So far we have assumed that attributions of truth to the \nproposition Q, where Q lacks a truth value, are \nfalse. However, an alternative approach is to suppose that if \nQ lacks a truth value, then both the proposition that \nQ is true and the proposition that Q is false lack \ntruth values too. This allows us to accept that the instances of \n(ES-prop) involving propositions that lack truth value are true, \nsince the two sides of the biconditional will have the same semantic \nvalue. Of course, if we accept the law of excluded middle — \nthat is, we accept that either Q or not-Q — \nthen we must also accept that either Q is true or \nnot-Q is true. Given that, by hypothesis, Q lacks a\ntruth value, this may seem odd. In particular, it is unclear how we \ncan express the fact that Q lacks a truth value. For we \ncannot describe this case by saying that Q is neither true \nnor false.  \n\nTo avoid this consequence, we may wish to distinguish two notions of \ntruth at this point. One notion of truth, call it the weak notion \n(Yablo 1985, Field 1994b), is implicitly defined by the instances of \n(weak-ES), all of which are asserted to hold. \n\nBecause all instances of (weak-ES) are true, it is the weak notion \nthat is required to express (11). \n\nIn short, weak truth is such that attributions of weak truth to a \ntruth-bearer have the same semantic value as the truth-bearer itself.\nIn contrast, a strong notion of truth will not make all instances of \n(strong-ES) hold. \n\nIn particular, propositions that lack truth value will falsify \n(strong-ES). This strong notion of truth appears to be required if we\nwish to say that it is neither true that Q nor true that \nnot-Q. For these sorts of reasons, some have suggested that \nordinary truth-talk vacillates between using a weak and a strong \nnotion of truth (see Field 1994b, McGee 2005). If this is right, then\nperhaps deflationists can focus on the weak notion of truth as \nprimary, and try to define up a strong notion of truth from it and \nadditional resources consistent with their position (see Field 1994b \nfor an attempt).  \n\nThere are, then, a number of strategies for dealing with the gap that\nare prima facie compatible with deflationism. However, in each case \nthere are reasons to worry about either the plausibility of the \nstrategy, or about whether, on closer inspection, deflationism will \nturn out to be inconsistent with the strategy. \n\nOne of the major tasks of philosophical logic in the twentieth \ncentury has been to provide a theory of truth that can deal with the \nancient problem of the liar paradox. Consider the following \nproposition. \n\nIf we accept the relevant instance of (ES-prop) for The Liar, and \nclassical logic, then contradiction quickly follows. Moreover, since \nderiving this contradiction does not rely on the supposition that \nsome proposition is neither true nor false, appealing to a weak \nnotion of truth will not help with this problem. Indeed, since the \nweak notion of truth implies that all instances of (ES-prop) are \ntrue, it is precisely this notion of truth that allows the \ncontradiction to be derived. A stronger notion of truth that \nrestricted (ES-prop) in certain ways might be able to avoid the liar \nparadox.  \n\nPartly for this reason, a number of philosophers have recently argued\nthat The Liar poses a special problem for deflationary theories of\ntruth (see Beall and Armour-Garb (eds.) 2005). That is, since it is\nunclear whether deflationists can appeal to a strong notion of truth,\nthey seem to be at a special disadvantage in dealing with the liar\nparadox. Moreover, it has been argued that one particular way of\nmotivating a restriction of (ES-prop) is incompatible with\ndeflationism: namely, that paradoxical sentences like The Liar are\nmeaningless, or do not express propositions. (Armour-Garb 2001; but\nsee Beall 2001 for a contrary view.)  \n\nHowever, as we mentioned above, not all deflationary theories are \ncommitted to the truth of all instances of (ES-prop). Horwich's \nminimal theory of truth, for example, only consists of all the \nnon-pathological instances of (ES-prop). One possible deflationist \nresponse to The Liar, then, is to simply bar the problematic \ninstances of (ES-prop) from the theory of truth. There are several \nproblems with this strategy. For one, by making this ad hoc manoeuvre\nwe lose the ability to explain why the pathological instances of \n(ES-prop) are pathological. After all, it is surely something about \nthe concept of truth, and in particular the role of the relevant \ninstances of (ES-prop), that explains why the liar paradox arises \n(Soames 1999, Gupta 2006). Another problem is that it is very \ndifficult, if not impossible, to spell out in advance which instances\nof (ES-prop) are paradoxical (Kripke 1975, McGee 1992, Yablo 1993). A\nfinal problem is that it appears we need to assume that the \nparadoxical instances of (ES-prop) are true if we are to assert (11) \n(Armour-Garb 2004, Gupta 2006). \n\nThese problems facing accounts that merely restrict the instances of \nthe equivalence schema suggest an alternative deflationist response \nto the liar. For both the fact that The Liar's instance of (ES-prop) \nis required to explain its (The Liar's) pathology, and the fact that \nwe need The Liar's instance of (ES-prop) to assert (11), give us good\nreason to suppose that even the paradoxical instances of (ES-prop) \nare true. Moreover, these reasons hold whether we are deflationists \nor inflationists. If this is right, then, since the paradox is \ngenerated merely from the relevant instance of (ES-prop) by classical\nlogic, The Liar poses no special problem for deflationists \n(Gupta 2006). And since everyone's problem is no one's, the liar \nparadox cannot be used against deflationists. This defence of \ndeflationism can be bolstered by noting that, like inflationists, \ndeflationists can try to deal with the liar paradox by modifying \nclassical logic (Field 2003), by adopting epistemicism (Restall \n2006), or by adopting a revision theory (Gupta and Belnap 1993). (See\nalso Maudlin 2004.)  \n\nHowever, there is a further line of argument that suggests there is a\nspecial problem for deflationists in this vicinity. The ideal theory \nof truth will be both consistent (e.g. avoids the liar paradox) and \nadequate (e.g. allows us to derive all the essential laws of truth, \nlike (11)). Yet it has been recently argued that even if \ndeflationists can give a consistent theory of truth, they cannot \nprovide an adequate theory. The argument for this conclusion turns on\nthe notion of a conservative extension of a theory. Informally, a \nconservative extension of a theory is one that does not allow us to \nprove any sentences that couldn't be proved from the original, \nunextended theory. More formally, and applied to theories of truth, a\ntruth theory, Tr is conservative over some theory \nT formulated in language L if and only if for every\nsentence φ of L in which the truth predicate doesn't\noccur, if Tr ∪ L  ⊢ \nφ, then L  ⊢  φ. As is well known,\ncertain truth theories are conservative over arithmetic —\ne.g. theories that implicitly define truth using only the instances of\n(ES-prop) — and certain truth theories are not —\ne.g. Tarski's compositional theory (Tarski 1944).  Specifically, the\naddition of certain truth theories allows us to prove that arithmetic\nis consistent, something we famously can't do if we are confined to\narithmetic itself.  \n\nNow, it has recently been argued (a) that conservative truth theories\nare inadequate and (b) deflationists are committed to conservative \ntruth theories (Shapiro 1998, Ketland 1999). The details of the \narguments for (a) are complicated and we will pass over them here \n(but see Field 1999 for criticism). To get a flavour of the arguments\nfor (b), consider Shapiro's rhetorical question: ‘How thin can \nthe notion of arithmetic truth be, if by invoking it we can learn \nmore about the natural numbers?’ Shapiro is surely right to \npress deflationists on their frequent claims that truth is 'thin' or \n'insubstantial'. It might also be a worry for deflationists if any \nadequate truth theory allowed us to derive non-logical truths, given \nthe common deflationist assertion that truth is a logical property. \nOn the other hand, deflationists themselves insist that truth is an \nexpressively useful device, and so they cannot be faulted merely for \npromoting a theory of truth that allows us to say more about matters \nnot involving truth. Whether there is more of a worry for \ndeflationists in the non-conservativeness of certain truth-theories \ndepends on subtle questions about what sort of axioms count as \nessential laws of truth and whether all conservative truth theories \nare inadequate (Shapiro 1998, Field 1999, Ketland 1999). Perhaps most\nimportantly, though, the debate over conservativeness highlights how \nunclear we are about the commitments of deflationism.  \n\nIt is commonly said that our beliefs and assertions aim at truth. The\nidea here, of course, is not that our beliefs and assertions are \nalways true in a statistical sense, or even that they are mostly \ntrue. The idea is rather that truth is a norm of assertion. \nThis fact about assertion and truth has often been seen to suggest \nthat deflationism must be false. However, the felt contradiction \nbetween normativity and deflationism is difficult to make precise.  \n\nThe first thing to say is that there is certainly a sense in which \ndeflationism is not inconsistent with the idea that truth is a norm \nof assertion. To illustrate this, notice that we can obtain an \nintuitive understanding of the content of this idea without \nmentioning truth at all, so long as we focus on a particular case. \nSuppose for whatever reason that Mary sincerely believes that snow is\ngreen, has good evidence for this belief, and on the basis of this \nbelief and evidence asserts that snow is green. We might say that \nthere is a norm of assertion which implies that Mary is in this case \nopen to criticism. After all, since snow is evidently not green, \nthere must be something incorrect or defective \nabout Mary's assertion that it is. It is this incorrection or \ndefectiveness that the idea that truth is a norm of assertion is \ntrying to capture. \n\nBut now let us see if we can give a general statement of the norm \nthat lies behind this particular case. The problem of providing a \ngeneral statement seems to be difficult, and for reasons that by now \nshould be familiar. To state the norm in general we would need to be \nable to do something we cannot really do, namely, to complete an \ninfinite conjunction of something like the following form: \n\nGiven the equivalence schema (F-prop*) provided by the deflationary\ntheory of falsity, however, this infinite conjunction can be\nreformulated as:  \n\nIn turn, this reformulated infinite conjunction can be reformulated as\na statement whose universal quantifier ranges over propositions:  \n\nOr, to put it as some philosophers might:  \n\nFor after all, if truth is a norm of assertion, then, if you assert\nsomething false, you are open to criticism. In short, then,\ndeflationists are certainly not denying that truth is a norm of\nassertion; on the contrary, the concept of truth is required to state\nthat very generalization.  \n\nIf the problem of normativity is not the straightforward one that \ndeflationists cannot account for the idea that truth is a norm of \nassertion, what is the problem? Crispin Wright argues that the \nproblem is not so much that deflationists cannot account for \nnormativity; rather, he suggests that the problem is twofold: first, \nthat any theory of truth that does account for normativity \nis ipso facto not a deflationary theory properly so-called, \nand second, that any theory of truth which employs the equivalence \nschemas can account for normativity (Wright 1992; and see Price 1998 \nfor discussion). The result is that, since most contemporary \nvarieties of deflationism evidently employ the equivalence schemas, \nmost contemporary varieties of deflationism are not varieties of \ndeflationism properly so-called. \n\nWright's objection from normativity is a difficult one to assess. For\none thing, it is difficult to find Wright's reason for supposing that\nthe equivalence schemas play such a central role in the explanation \nof normativity. As we have seen, the equivalence schemas are crucial \nin providing a general statement of the idea that truth is a norm of \nassertion, but there seems for all that no internal connection \nbetween truth and the norm in question, and thus no internal\nconnection between the equivalence schemas and that norm (cf. Price \n1998). Nor is it clear what role normativity plays in the distinction\nbetween an inflationary and a deflationary theory of truth. Certainly\nit is not good enough to simply define deflationism so that \nany deflationary theory cannot account for normativity. Of course, it\nis a consequence of a definition of this sort that a theory of truth \nis either inflationary or false; but then again, no deflationist will\naccept the definition. \n\nWhatever one thinks of the details of Wright's objection, however, it\ndoes have far-reaching consequences for deflationism about truth.\nWhat the objection forces us to consider is the possibility that there\nis no very clear distinction between an inflationary and a\ndeflationary theory of truth. Indeed, this possibility — that\nthere is no clear inflationary/deflationary distinction — is the\ntopic of the final objection to deflationism that we will discuss. \n\nThe final objection begins by drawing attention to a little known\ndoctrine about truth that G.E. Moore held at the beginning of the\ncentury. Richard Cartwright describes the view as follows: “a\ntrue proposition is one that has a certain simple unanalyzable\nproperty, and a false proposition is one that lacks the\nproperty” (1987, p. 73).  This doctrine about truth is, of\ncourse, to be understood as the analogue for truth of the doctrine\nthat Moore held about good, namely that good is a simple, unanalyzable\nquality.  \n\nThe problem that this Moorean view about truth presents for the \ndeflationary theory might best be expressed in the form of a \nquestion: what is the difference between the Moorean view and \ndeflationism? Of course, there is a sense in which the flavour of the\nMoorean view is very different from the flavour of the deflationist \ntheory about truth. After all, what could be more inflationary than \nthinking that truth is a property of a proposition that is \nunanalyzable? Certainly Moore's view about good has been viewed in \nthis light. However, the fact that one view has a different flavour \nfrom another does not mean that, at bottom, they are not the same \nview. One might perhaps suggest that, according to the deflationary \ntheory, the concept of truth has an important logical role, i.e., to \ncapture generalizations. However, this doesn't really answer our \nquestion. For one thing, it isn't clear that Moore's notion might not\nalso capture generalizations. For another, the idea that the \ndeflationary concept of truth plays an important logical role doesn't\ndistinguish the metaphysics of deflationism from the metaphysics of \nthe Moorean view; and it is the metaphysics of the matter that the \npresent objection really brings into focus. Alternatively, one might \nsuggest that the distinction between truth according to deflationism \nand truth according to Moore's view is the distinction between having\na simple unanalyzable nature, and not having a nature at all. \nHowever, what is that distinction? It is certainly not obvious that \nthere is any distinction between having a nature about which nothing \ncan be said and having no nature at all. \n\nThe problem is particularly acute in light of the fact that \ndeflationism has often been discussed in the context of various \nclaims about reductionism. In many discussions of deflationism, for \nexample, the opponent is assumed to be a particular version of a \ncorrespondence theory that attempts to reduce the correspondence \nrelation to certain relations of causation (Field 1986 is a good \nexample). However, it should be noted that this kind of view is also \nopposed to the kind of position that takes semantic facts-such as a \nproposition's being true-as primitive (Field 1972 is a good example).\nAnd the problem that we are considering for deflationism is that \nthese two views are not simply identical in being opposed to the kind\nof view that explains correspondence in terms of causation: it is \nthat they are identical simpliciter. The suggestion, in \nshort, is that deflationism is identical to what initially seems to \nbe its complete opposite, Moorean inflationism. \n\nThe decision to be an inflationist or a deflationist about truth has\nbeen called “the biggest decision a theorist of truth must\nmake” (Boghossian 1990). Certainly this is true at an intuitive\nlevel. But it is sobering also to realize that it is not exactly clear\nwhat this decision amounts to when subjected to philosophical\nscrutiny. And this suggests that there is still a lot of work to be\ndone before we can arrive at a final evaluation of the deflationary\ntheory of truth."}]
