Although he remained outside\n‘professional’ philosophical circles, in that he never held\na University post, he was respected in his time for his scholarship and\nbreadth of learning. His writings were notorious even in his own time\nfor the challenges they threw down to the reader. These challenges to\ninterpretation and understanding are only heightened today.\n\n\n\nNevertheless an increasing number of scholars from philosophy,\ntheology, aesthetics and German studies are finding his ideas and\ninsights of value to contemporary concerns. His central preoccupations\nare still pertinent: language, knowledge, the nature of the human\nperson, sexuality and gender and the relationship of humanity to God.\nMeanwhile, his views, which in many respects anticipate later\nchallenges to the Enlightenment project and to modernity, are still\nrelevant and even provocative.\n\n\n\nJohann Georg Hamann was born in Königsberg in 1730, the son of\na midwife and a barber-surgeon. He began study in philosophy and\ntheology at the age of 16, changed to law but mainly read literature,\nphilology, and rhetoric, but also mathematics and science. He left\nuniversity without completing his studies and became the governor to a\nwealthy family on a Baltic estate. During this time he continued his\nextraordinarily broad reading and private research. He took up a job in\nthe family firm of a friend from his Königsberg days, Christoph\nBerens, and was sent on an obscure mission to London, in which he\nevidently failed. He then led a high life until he ran out of friends,\nmoney and support. In a garret, depressed and impoverished, he read the\nBible cover to cover and experienced a religious conversion. \n\nHe returned to the House of Berens in Riga, where they evidently\nforgave him his failure. He fell in love with Christoph Berens' sister,\nKatharina, but was refused permission to marry her by his friend, on\nthe grounds of his religious conversion; Berens was an enthusiastic\nfollower of the Enlightenment and was nauseated by the more pious\nmanifestations of Hamann's new-found religiosity. Smarting from this\nblow and its motivations, Hamann returned to his father's house in\nKönigsberg, where he lived for the rest of his life until his\nfinal months. \n\nIn Königsberg, he never held an official academic post, nor an\necclesiastical one; this may in part have been due to his pronounced\nspeech impediment, which inhibited him from either lecturing or\npreaching. Eventually, through the intercession of his acquaintance,\nImmanuel Kant, he found employment as a low-level civil servant working\nin the tax office of Frederick the Great; a ruler Hamann in fact\ndespised. Nevertheless his principal activity was as an editor and a\nwriter; he was considered one of the most widely-read scholars of his\ntime (greatly aided by his fluency in many languages), as well as a\nnotorious author. During this time, despite his committed Christianity,\nhe lived with a woman whom he never married but to whom he remained\ndevoted and faithful, having four children on whom he doted, and who\noccasionally feature in his writings (principally as unruly\ndistractions to the author's scholarship). \n\nAt the end of his life he accepted an invitation to Münster\nfrom one of his admirers, Princess Gallitzin. He died in Münster\nin 1788. \n\nHamann had a profound influence on the German ‘Storm and\nStress’ movement, and on other contemporaries such as Herder and\nJacobi; he impressed Hegel and Goethe (who called him the brightest\nhead of his time) and was a major influence on Kierkegaard. His\ninfluence continued on twentieth century German thinkers, particularly\nthose interested in language. His popularity has increased dramatically\nin the last few decades amongst philosophers, theologians, and German\nstudies scholars around the world. \n\nHamann's writings are all short; he was not given to extensive\ntreatises. They are also usually motivated by something very specific:\nsomeone else's publication, or particular circumstances and events.\nWhen responding to these, he presupposes considerable knowledge on the\npart of the reader; typically his responses to the work of others\ninvolves adoption of their terminology and style, blending into mimicry\nand parody as a rhetorical and argumentative device. Moreover, woven\ninto these writings is an extraordinary breadth and quantity of\ncitations and allusions; and by no means are these all clear and\nobvious. Thus, when he chooses, his essays are a tapestry of\nmulticolored threads of the ideas, language, and imagery of thinkers,\nbe they ancient, biblical, or contemporary. These are woven across a\nwoof of a love of irony, which as ever adds a layer of interpretative\ncomplexity. \n\nHamann's writings also frequently appear under the name of various\nfanciful characters: Aristobolus, the Knight of the Rose-Cross, the\nSibyl, Adelgunde. It cannot be assumed that such characters faithfully\nrepresent Hamann's own views; The opinions of Aristobolus, for example,\nare a device to deconstruct and drive to absurdity a number of views\nwhich Hamann opposes. \n\nThese factors combine to make Hamann's writings notoriously\ndifficult to understand and interpret. Goethe observed that when\nreading Hamann, “one must completely rule out what one normally\nmeans by understanding” [Goethe, 550]. Even if one has – or\npainfully acquires, or borrows from other current scholars – the\nbreadth of reference to understand the source of an allusion or\ncitation, it is not always clear what the citation is doing there, and\nwhat Hamann means to suggest by referring to it. He delighted in\nsporting with his reader; preferring to present a balled fist and leave\nit to the reader to unroll it into a flat hand (to borrow one of his\nown images; cf. the end of the “Metacritique of the Purism of\nReason”, 1780). \n\nThis impenetrability has been taken by some to signify an incapacity\nfor clear expression on Hamann's part. Hegel remarked: “The French\nhave a saying: Le stile c'est l'homme meme (‘The style\nis the man himself’); Hamann's writings do not have a\nparticular style but rather are style through and through”\n[Hegel, 209]. Others, however, have pointed to the clarity and\nconcision of his letters, in contrast to the puzzling style he uses to\naddress the public. They suggest that Hamann's challenging style forms\nare an important part of Hamann's hermeneutics and his understanding\nof the relationship between the writer and reader: two halves of a\nwhole who must relate themselves to one another and unite for a common\ngoal (“Reader and Critic”, 1762). The reader cannot be\npassive and must work to reconstruct Hamann's meaning. As Hamann\nobserved, “A writer who is in a hurry to be understood today or\ntomorrow runs the danger of being misunderstood the day after\ntomorrow.” \n\nConsequently, Hamann is highly susceptible to misinterpretation. For\nexample, one can find in recent English-language treatments the\nunderstanding of Hamann as an ‘irrationalist’, and one who\nsimply opposed the Enlightenment with all his might; this however is\nnot supported by the majority of Hamann scholars and is seen as a\nfailure to understand the complexity of his thinking. \n\nHis principal writings include: Biblische Betrachtungen\n[Biblical Reflections], Gedanken über meinen Lebenslauf\n[Thoughts on the Course of my Life], Brocken [Fragments],\nSokratische Denkwürdigkeiten [Socratic Memorabilia],\nWolken [Clouds], Kreuzzüge des Philologen\n[Crusades of the Philologian], a collection of essays including\nAesthetica in Nuce, Versuch über eine akademische Frage\n[Essay on an academic question], and Kleeblatt Hellenistischer\nBriefe [Cloverleaf of Hellenistic Letters]; Schriftsteller und\nKunstrichter [Author and Critic], Leser und Kunstrichter\n[Reader and Critic], Fünf Hirtenbriefe [Five Pastoral\nLetters], Des Ritters von Rosencreuz letzte Willensmeynung\nüber den göttlichen und menschlichen Urprung der Sprache\n[The Knight of the Rose-Cross' Last Will and Testament on the divine\nand human origin of language], Philologische Einfälle und\nZweifel [Philological Ideas and Doubts], Hierophantische\nBriefe [Hierophantic Letters], Versuch einer Sibylle über\ndie Ehe [Essay of a Sibyl on Marriage], Konxompax, Metakritik\nüber den Purismum der Vernunft [Metacritique of the Purism of\nReason], Golgotha und Scheblimini [Golgotha and Scheblimini],\nFliegender Brief [Flying Letter]. \n\nAt the end of his life, Hamann chose to designate his authorship as\n“Metacritique”, a word he coined for his engagement with\nKant's Critique of Pure Reason. Instead of creating a\nsystematic theology, or an epistemology, he seems to have seen his\nwork as one that examines the foundations and nature of philosophical\nand theological critique itself. Rather like the late Wittgenstein,\nhis work was deconstructive; he belongs in the camp of philosophers\nwhom Richard Rorty has described as “edifying and\ntherapeutic” rather than “constructive and\nsystematic” (Rorty, 5–6). He brings to any issue in philosophy\nnot a constructive account, but an approach, a set of convictions,\nsomething akin to ethical principles.  He anticipated Rorty's emphasis\non the curative aspects of this task; at the end of his life, he\nwanted his collected works to be published under the title\n“Curative Baths” (“Saalbadereyen”\n— a reference to healing practices of the time and an allusion\nto his father's profession.)  Each volume was to be called a\n‘Tub’. This project was sadly never realized, not even\nunder a more conventional title. \n\nOne abiding characteristic of Hamann's many responses to the\nphilosophy of his time, therefore, is this ‘metacritical’\ninstinct: not to construct a rival account, but to go for the jugular;\nnot to set up a rival critique, but to insist that critique itself must\nbe subject to meta-critique, which concerns itself with the issues that\nmust be attended to in relation to the act of philosophical reflection\nitself. It consists of attention to the fundamental stance or position\non issues or insights that must underlie any work on philosophy or\ntheology. According to Hamann, often “the difficulties lie in\nwomb of the concepts” (N III, 31, 21). Hamann's writing therefore\nis not so much ‘unsystematic’ as is sometimes said, but\n‘presystematic’. He addresses issues that must be\nrecognized in any self-critical reflection, matters that must be\npresuppositions for any system. Thus one of the most salient features\nof his “Metacritique of the Purism of Reason”, his\nunpublished response to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, was to\nfocus on the question of language. Through a tissue of imagery, he\nsuggests that a proper view of language implies that the alleged\n‘purity’ of a priori reason is untenable. \n\nThese metacritical issues, for Hamann, principally include language,\nknowledge, and the nature of the human person. Hamann also, most\nurgently and most controversially (then as now), did not believe that\nany of these issues can be answered outside a theological perspective;\nthat is, without reference to God as humanity's creator and dialogue\npartner. \n\nA second feature of Hamann's approach is a tendency which Goethe saw\nas holism. This is perhaps not the best way to describe Hamann's\ninsight, as Hamann characteristically emphasised the brokenness of\nhuman experience, and fragmentariness of human knowledge: “Gaps\nand lacks … is the highest and deepest knowledge of human\nnature, through which we must climb our way up to the ideal —\nideas and doubts — the summum bonum of our\nreason” (ZH 3, 34:33–35). Hamann essentially disliked attempts\nto isolate the phenomenon under consideration from other aspects with\nwhich he felt it to be intimately connected; this precludes a deep and\ntrue understanding of our existence. Taken as far as he did, this\nmeans that philosophy of language must include a discussion of God,\nand a discussion of God must make reference to sexuality and vice\nversa. \n\nThus in “Essay of a Sibyl on Marriage”, which he takes\nas an opportunity to write about sex, a proper understanding of human\nsexuality and erotic enjoyment cannot be understood without seeing\nhumanity as the creature of God, made in God's image. He plays with the\nChristian idea of God as a Trinity to depict a trinity of woman-man-God\nin the moment of lovemaking; and reworks the account of the creation of\nAdam in Genesis to describe the act of coitus itself. The woman on\nperceiving her lover in his excitement sees ‘that rib’ and\ncries out in enthusiastic appropriation, ‘That is bone of my bone\nand flesh of my flesh!’ The man then ‘fills the hole of the\nplace with flesh’ (as Genesis describes God doing with Adam after\nthe creation of Eve). In doing so the lover also acknowledges that the\norigin of a man is in woman's body: the ‘Sibyl’ describes\nthis moment of lovemaking as “he entered in whence he once came\nforth.” Indeed, as Christ was born of a woman, the salvation of\nhumanity proceeds from a woman's sexual body; the vagina is also\ndescribed as the place that the Saviour came forth as the body's healer\n(the German language permits Hamann here to pun on ‘healer’\nand ‘saviour’). This inclination to combine topics more\noften kept separate (such as ‘the concept of God’ and\n‘having sex’) is salient throughout his work. \n\nHamann's tool for conceiving the interrelation of these dimensions\nof human life increasingly was the Principle of the Union of Opposites.\nHe writes approvingly of this principle to his friends; particularly\nafter his encounter with Kant's new epistemology, claiming to value it\nmore than the principles of contradiction and of sufficient reason, and\nindeed more than the whole Kantian Critique (ZH 5, 327:12ff; ZH 4,\n462:7–8). Contradictions and apparent oppositions fill our\nexperience: \n\nFar from being a pre-condition for truth, the absence of\ncontradiction is in Hamann's eyes a pre-condition for dogmatism.\nKnowledge must not proceed on the basis of unanimity and the absence of\ncontradiction, but must proceed through the dialogue and relation of\nthese different voices. (Hamann does not think in terms of Hegel's\nlater dialectical synthesis.) When Hamann speaks of\n‘opposition’ and contradictions, however, he does so in an\nironic tone; for it is clearly his conviction that there is a\nfundamental unity in things, and the oppositions and contradictions\nthat we perceive are chiefly of our own making. He insists that his\nperception is ‘without Manichaeism’ (ZH 5, 327:16–17). Body\nand mind, senses and reason, reason and passion are not truly opposed.\nThese are contrasting elements of the same unified — unified but\nnot homogenous — reality. Hamann tries to steer a course between\nScylla and Charybdis: between the dogmatic, even tyrannical\nextermination of opposition and contradiction; and the elimination of\ncontradiction through a false synthesis or fusion achieved by an\napparent acceptance of antithetical realities. \n\nThe Principle of the Union of Opposites as a tactical tool,\ntherefore, does not imply that Hamann sees the world in terms of\ndivisions and dualism. It is his strategy for coping with the schematic\nantitheses abundant in Enlightenment philosophy. \n\nHamann used the notion of ‘Prosopopoeia’, or\npersonification, as an image of what can happen in philosophical\nreflection. In a medieval morality or mystery play, the experience of\nbeing chaste or being lustful is transformed from a way of acting or\nfeeling into a dramatic character who then speaks and acts as a\npersonification of that quality. So too in philosophy, Hamann suggests.\nThe philosopher distinguishes differing aspects in the phenomenon under\nscrutiny and exaggerates their difference. These aspects are ennobled\ninto faculties, and through ‘prosopopoeia’ are hypostasized\ninto entities. Thus in the act of reflecting on something,\n‘reasoning’ is distinguished from ‘feeling’,\nand turned from a verb or gerund into a noun —\n‘reason’—which is then named as a constituent of our\nbeing. Reason then becomes a thing to which we can ascribe properties.\n(This shows perhaps a streak bordering on nominalism in Hamann.) \n\nThe best example of this, and of Hamann's response, is his treatment\nof the word ‘reason’. Since he handles it with a kind of\nskepticism or even distaste, he is often called an\n‘irrationalist’. It is clear however that Hamann puts a\nhigh value on certain ways of being reasonable and of reasoning\nactivity. “Without language we would have no reason,\nwithout reason no religion, and without these three essential aspects\nof our nature, neither mind [Geist] nor bond of\nsociety” (N III, 231, 10–12). \n\nHamann's treatment of reason instead is a deconstruction, both of\nthe prosopopoeic use of the word and the Enlightenment valuation of it.\nThere is no such thing as reason — there is only reasoning.\nReasoning, as something we do, is as fallible as we are, and as such is\nsubject to our position in history, or own personality, or the\ncircumstances of the moment. ‘It’ is therefore not a\nuniversal, healthy and infallible ‘faculty’ as Hamann's\nEnlightenment contemporaries often maintained: \nHamann is sometimes portrayed simply as an opponent of “the\nEnlightenment”. This presupposes of course that “the\nEnlightenment” constitutes a unified stance on a number of\nphilosophical issues, an assumption which is questionable. The\nmajority of Hamann scholars today see his position in a more complex\nway. Hamann opposed many of the popular convictions of his\ntime. However, Hamann fought his contemporaries on many fronts;\ntherefore there were often areas of considerable agreement with some\nof his opponents. One example would be the way that he deployed Hume\nas a weapon against Enlightenment rationalism, not least against Kant\n(although Hamann was the one who introduced Kant to Hume's writings in\nthe first place). Although Hamann, as a Christian, had profound\ndisagreements with Hume's thought in its atheistic aspects,\nnevertheless he used Humean skepticism in his own deconstructive\nwritings. Hume's doubts about the reliability and self-sufficiency of\nreason were grist to Hamann's mill. Hume's insistence that\n“belief” underlies much of our thinking and reasoning was\nadopted and deployed by Hamann, often with a linguistic sleight of\nhand. By using the word “Glaube” (which in German\nincludes both “belief” in an epistemic sense and\n“faith” in a religious sense), Hamann could assert that\n“faith”, not rational grounds, underlies his\ncontemporaries' high valuation of reason. Thus even the\nenthusiastic advocates of impartiality and “reason”, who\nare also skeptics about “blind faith”, have ultimately\nonly faith as the ground for their convictions. \n\nJudging from letters late in his life, Hamann preferred to be seen as\na “metacritic” of the Enlightenment. His dissatisfactions\nwith what he viewed as a certain Enlightenment program began early,\nfollowing his conversion to Christianity; and his challenge could be\nseen not as a blunt, unreasoning opposition to rationality, but as a\ndeeper (and more disruptive) challenge to what rationality and\nEnlightenment actually consist in. Often these are seen in his\nresonses to his friend Immanuel Kant. An early challenge came in his\nfirst public essay, “Socratic Memorabilia” (1759), which\nwas dedicated to Kant and their mutual friend Christoph Berens. Kant\nand Berens had sought to cast him as a campaigner on behalf of the\nEnlightenment. In the essay he portrays Socrates, the hero of the\nEnlightenment, as a Christ-figure rather than a champion of secular\nreason. Hamann's abreaction to what he viewed as a misguided\ndeification and purification of reason reaches a climax in 1784, in\nhis unpublished response to Kant — “Metacritique of the\nPurism of Reason” (1984) and in an inflamed private letter to\nChristian Jacob Kraus in the same year. This letter takes issue with\nKant's famous essay “An Answer to the Question: What is\nEnlightenment?” (1984). Here he argues that what Kant describes\nas the intellectual “self-incurred minority” (minority in\nthe sense of being a minor, immaturity, tutelage) of the general\npublic, an (alleged) need to be told what to think, is not\nself-imposed. Rather, it is imposed, Hamann suggests, on the one hand\nby a politically authoritarian regime hostile to dissent and political\nfree-thinking, while encouraging religious free-thinking; and on the\nother hand by professional experts: the “prattle and reasoning\nof those emancipated immature ones, who set themselves up as\nguardians”. “True enlightenment,” Hamann concludes\nsarcastically, “consists in an emergence of the immature person\nfrom a supremely self-incurred guardianship.”  \n\nLanguage is one of Hamann's most abiding philosophical concerns.\nFrom the beginning of his work, Hamann championed the priority which\nexpression and communication, passion and symbol possess over\nabstraction, analysis and logic in matters of language. Neither logic\nnor even representation (in Rorty's sense) possesses the rights of the\nfirst-born. Representation is secondary and derivative rather than the\nwhole function of language. Symbolism, imagery, metaphor have primacy;\n“Poetry is the mother-tongue of the human race” (N II,\n197). To think that language is essentially a passive system of signs\nfor communicating thoughts is to deal a deathblow to true language. \n\nFor all Hamann's emphasis in his earlier writings on passion and\nemotion, he does not equate language with emotional expression. This\nbecame clear in his engagement with the writing of his younger friend\nHerder on the origin of language. Language has a mediating relationship\nbetween our reflection, one another, and our world; and as it is not\nsimply the cries of emotion of an animal, so too it is not a smothering\ncurtain between us and the rest of reality. Language also has a\nmediating role between God and us. Hamann's answer to a debate of his\ntime, the origin of language — divine or human?—is that its\norigin is found in the relationship between God and humanity. Typically\nhe has the ‘Knight of the Rose-Cross’ express this in the\nform of a ‘myth’, rather than attempting to work out such a\nclaim logically and systematically. Rewriting the story of the Garden\nof Eden, he describes this paradise as: \n\nThis makes the origin of language as easy and natural as child's\nplay. \n\nBy the end of his life, because of his engagement with Kant, the\nmost urgent question among the relationships that constitute language\nis the relationship of language to thinking or ‘reason’. In\nhis view, the central question of Kant's first Critique, the\nvery possibility of a priori knowledge and of pure reason,\ndepends on the nature of language. In a passage full of subtle\nallusions to Kantian passages and terms, he writes: \n\nLanguage is forced to take part in the ‘purification of\nphilosophy’, as he describes it in his Metacritique of Kant: the\nattempt to expunge experience and tradition from rational reflection.\nLanguage itself is the final victim in this threefold\n‘purification’. It is for this reason however that language\ncan constitute the cure for philosophy. Language is the embodiment of\nexperience and tradition; as long as the ability to think rests on\nlanguage, neither ‘reason’ nor ‘philosophy’ can\nbe pure of the empirical, of experience, and of the experience of the\nothers to whom we relate. It itself, for Hamann, embodies a relation:\nit itself is a ‘union of opposites’, of the aesthetic and\nthe logical, the bodily and the intellectual; it unites the divisions\nKant's Critique creates. \n\nFor Hamann, in contrast to Kant, the question is therefore not so\nmuch ‘what is reason?’ as ‘what is language?’,\nas he writes in a letter. This is the ground of the paralogisms and\nantinomies that Kant raises in his Critique. Sharing Hume's empiricism\nand Berkeley's suspicion of universals and abstract terms, he\nconcludes: “Hence it happens that one takes words for\nconcepts, and concepts for the things\nthemselves” (ZH 5, 264:34–265:1).  Language then has a\nfundamental role to play in unmasking the philosopher's tendency to\n‘prosopopoeia’. The relation of language to reason he\ncertainly did not feel had solved, however, as he wrote to a\nfriend: \n\nFor Hamann, knowledge is inseparable from self-knowledge, and\nself-knowledge inseparable from knowledge of the other. We are visible,\nas in a mirror, in each other; “God and my neighbor are therefore\na part of my self-knowledge, my self-love” (N I, 302:16-23). He\nwrites in a letter: “Self knowledge begins with the neighbor, the\nmirror, and just the same with true self-love; that goes from the\nmirror to the matter” (ZH 6, 281:16–17). Sometimes this\nexploration of self-knowledge through interpersonal intimacy takes a\nsexual form, as in the Sibyl's Essay on Marriage (already\ndiscussed). \n\nAll forms of knowledge, of learning and development even of the most\nnatural functions, require the help of another. (The ‘Knight of\nthe Rose Cross’, while jesting with Hume, tells us ironically\nthat even eating and drinking, and indeed excretion, are not\ninstinctual or innate but require teaching.) (N III, 28:26–28; N III,\n29:7–10) This is conceived not only in such immediately interpersonal\nways, but also more widely in the context of the community. The\nindispensability of ‘the other’ for knowledge is also the\nreason that Hamann gives the importance he does to tradition in the\nformation of knowledge. “Our reason arises, at the very least,\nfrom this twofold lesson of sensuous revelations and human\ntestimonies” (N III 29:28–30). Years before Kant's first\nCritique, Hamann attempts to relate the senses and the\nunderstanding and their roles in knowledge, using a characteristically\nconcrete metaphor: the senses are like the stomach, the understanding\nlike blood vessels. Not only do the blood vessels need the stomach to\nreceive the nourishment that they distribute; the stomach also needs\nthe blood vessels to function. This insistence on the mutual dependency\nand interrelation of sense experience and understanding (as opposed to\nmany Enlightenment views that plumped for either reason or the senses\nas the dominant party) was refined in his engagement with Kant's\ncritique. Throughout his life, he was neither materialist, purely\nempiricist or positivist, nor idealist, rationalist or intellectualist\nin his epistemology. Rather, he is firmly against dividing knowledge or\nways of knowing into different kinds. “The philosophers have\nalways given truth a bill of divorce, by separating what nature has\njoined together and vice versa” (N III, 40: 3–5). With Kant's\ncritique, the problem becomes still more urgent; Kant's treatment of\nthe issue is a “violent, unwarranted, obstinate divorce of what\nnature has joined together”. Revising Kant's metaphor of\nsensibility and understanding as two stems of human knowledge, he\nsuggests we see knowledge as a single stem with two roots. Thus he\nrejects the division of what can be known a priori from what\ncan be known a posteriori, and many of the consequences of such a\nstance. Here again he reaches for the ‘Principle of the Union of\nOpposites’ in his deployment of imagery to suggest a different\napproach. The relation of the senses and understanding is a\n‘hypostatic union’, a ‘communicatio\nidiomatum’ (phrases borrowed from Christian theological\ndiscussion of how the two natures of divine and human are united in\nChrist). This mysterious union can only be revealed and understood by\n‘ordinary language’. (In suggesting that the problems in\nphilosophy can be cured by attending to ‘ordinary\nlanguage’, he clearly anticipates the late Wittgenstein). \n\nIn this engagement with Kant, Hamann returns and deepens the lesson\nhe had learnt much earlier in his reading of Hume: that belief or faith\nis an essential precursor for knowledge. Everything is dependent or\ngrounded on faith; there is no privileged position for any kind or form\nof knowledge (a priori, scientific, etc.) In Hamann's epistemology, the\nhard division between ‘knowledge’ and ‘belief’\nor ‘faith’ becomes eroded. Both knowledge and faith rest on\na foundation of trust; neither rest on a foundation of indubitability.\n“Every philosophy consists of certain and uncertain knowledge, of\nidealism and realism, of sensuousness and deductions. Why should only\nthe uncertain be called belief? What then are—rational\ngrounds?” (ZH 7, 165:33–37) ‘Sensuousness’\ntranslates Sinnlichkeit (Kant's ‘sensibility’).\nBelief and reason both need each other; idealism and realism are a\nfantasized opposition, of which the authentic use of reason knows\nnothing. The unity that lies in the nature of things should lie at the\nfoundation of all our concepts and reflection (ZH 7, 165:7–17). \n\nFrom his ‘debut’ work, Socratic Memorabilia,\nHamann began to promulgate a particular view of what it means to\nunderstand something. From the beginning of that essay he emphasized\nthe importance of passion and commitment in interpretation; undermining\nthe more conventional assumption that objectivity and detachment are\nprerequisites of philosophical reflection and understanding. In\nAesthetica in Nuce, wearing the authorial mask of the\n‘kabbalistic philologian’, he provocatively maintained that\ninitiation into orgies were necessary before the interpreter could\nsafely begin the hermeneutical act. The idea that one must rid oneself\nof presuppositions, prejudices, and predilections in order to do\njustice to the subject matter he characterizes as ‘monastic\nrules’—i.e. an excessive asceticism and abstinence. He goes\nso far as to compare such individuals to self-castrating eunuchs (N\nII, 207:10–20). \n\nHamann's skepticism about neutrality and objectivity does not make\nhim a ‘subjectivist’, however. The stance and disposition\nof the interpreter is integral, helpful, indeed, indispensable and must\nbe acknowledged; but limitless subjectivity arouses Hamann's scorn.\nThose who ‘flood the text’ with glosses and marginalia,\n“dreaming up one's own inspiration and interpretation,”\nHamann likens to the blind leading the blind (N II, 208:3ff). \n\nThe constraints which Hamann places on the interpreter's\nsubjectivity are not those usually advocated, therefore: an avoidance\nof prejudice and pre-conceptions; an amnesia for one's own history,\ntradition and culture; an obedience to exegetical rules. The first\nrestraint on subjective distortion is the interpreter's own common\nsense; the last is the reaction of the text itself: “what are you\ntrying to make of me?” The interpreter's freedom is inextricable\nfrom the interpreter's respect and responsibility, in Hamann's\nview. \n\nThe responsible interpreter is conscious of standing within\nsomething larger than oneself: a tradition. The wise interpreter is a\nkabbalist, one who interprets an ancient text, and a\nrhapsodist—the original meaning of the latter being one who\nstitches something together from pre-existing materials. (In Ancient\nGreece the ‘rhapsodist’ was one who recited poems cobbled\ntogether from prior sources, usually bits of Homer.) In creating\ninterpretations, the interpreter enjoys the freedom to create anew, as\nHamann created his characteristic prose from pre-existing texts, while\ncreating a new meaningful piece. Hamann's use of this genre itself\nmakes the point: the demand that only one meaning may exist for a text\narises from an impoverished notion of meaning and creativity; one that\nmisunderstands the nature of composition and the nature of\ninterpretation alike. \n\nHamann's rejected both exegetical ‘materialism’ and\n‘idealism’, as he called them — literalism and\nexcessive flights of fancy. In thus insisting on the integrity of\n‘the letter and the spirit’, he means to preserve\nthe place of author, text and reader alike. Both meaning and\ninterpretation rest in a three-way relationship. \n\nFor Hamann, the depth and meaning of a text go beyond the author's\nown contribution, and are the responsibility of the interpreter:\n“Few authors understand themselves, and a proper reader must not\nonly understand his author but also be able to see beyond\nhim” (ZH 6, 22:10–12). And yet this recognition that the\nauthor's opinions and intentions do not exhaust the possibilities of\nthe text does not annihilate the place of the author. At the very\nleast, the ‘beyond’ of the text includes a territory which,\nif unknown to the author, is not unrelated: that is, the author's own\nunconscious workings and meanings. It is not accidental that Hamann\nobserves not that few authors understand their own\ntext, but that few authors understand themselves.\nThis suggests a picture of creation in which more of the author is\nexpressed in a text and entrusted to the interpreter than the author's\nconscious intentions and opinions. This in turn suggests a picture of\ninterpretation—of “understanding one's hero” as\nHamann put it when writing about Socrates—in which greater\nsensitivity, insight, and fidelity is demanded of the interpreter than\nwould otherwise be the case. Above all, the interpreter must have the\ncourage to be a kabbalist; that is, to say more than the text does, not\nto express oneself but to say what the author left unsaid. The fruits\nof such faithful creativity may be impossible to ‘justify’\nor ‘verify’ to the demands of the objectivist, however. \n\nFundamentally, for Hamann hermeneutics consists in perceiving the\nunderlying relationship beneath the phenomenon in question; at the\nleast, of course, the relationship between the author and the\ninterpreter which requires such fidelity. Given Hamann's religious\nviews, this at once introduces a theological dimension. Ultimately,\nthis means that for Hamann proper hermeneutics rests on one thing:\nperceiving God revealed within the phenomenon, whether that be nature\nor history (cf. Socratic Memorabilia and Aesthetica in\nNuce for examples). Even the interpretation of ourselves is a\nrevelation of God; a recognition of whose image solves all the most\ncomplicated knots and riddles of our nature (N II, 206:32–207:2;\n198:3–5). \n\nThe topics examined so far all have their anthropological\nimplications. Hamann's critique of the socio-political implications of\nKant's vision of ‘enlightenment’ rests on a conviction\nabout our social and political destiny. Hamann sees our socio-political\nvocation as consisting firstly in ‘criticism’ (or\n‘critique’)—recognizing and appropriating, or hating\nand rejecting, the true vs. the false, good vs. evil, beautiful vs.\nugly; and secondly in ‘politics’, which is increasing or\nreducing them. This is not the prerogative of the ruler; every one is\nat once their own ‘king’, their own\n‘legislator’; but also the ‘first-born of their\nsubjects’. It is our “republican privilege” to\ncontribute to this destiny, “the critical and magisterial office\nof a political animal” (N III, 38–39). \n\nThe concepts of knowledge and language and their many facets also\nimply a particular anthropology: the diversity yet integration of the\nhuman being. For Hamann, the truest picture of humanity is of diversity\nin unity; a number of different, often contrasting aspects and features\ntogether composing the human person. Hamann consequently did not\nconfine his attention to epistemology and reason when considering what\nhuman beings are, and passion, the thirst for vengeance, and sexual\necstasy form a part of his picture as well. (In response to the\nEnlightenment aesthetic of art as the imitation of ‘beautiful\nnature’, Hamann's ironic observation was: “The thirst for\nvengeance was the beautiful nature which Homer imitated” (ZH 2,\n157:12).) \n\nThe theme of interdependence between human beings, which was\nemphasized in his epistemology, also has its roots in his understanding\nof what it is to be human. We are not self-sufficient; but for Hamann,\neven our lacks and failings have a positive thrust, this signifier of\ndependency making us all the more suited for the enjoyment of nature\nand one another. \n\nIf there is a fundamental key to his thinking on humanity, it is the\nidea that the human being is the image of God. This is admittedly more\ntheological than philosophical, but is essential for understanding\nHamann's philosophical anthropology. Hamann's treatment of this\nperennial theme is hardly conventional in the history of Christian\nthinking. While the experience of sinfulness and wickedness is a\npowerful theme, particularly in his earlier, post-conversion writing,\nthe fundamental thrust of his thinking is the easy exchange between the\nhuman and the divine. In this exchange, language is “the sign,\nsymbol and pledge of a new, mysterious, inexpressible but all the more\nintimate union, participation and community of divine energies and\nideas” (N III, 32:21–24). Despite his reputation for being an\nirrationalist, reasoning too relates us to God; God, nature and reason\nare described as having the same relation as light, the eye and what we\nsee, or as author, text and reader (ZH 5, 272:14–16). \n\nOne must also remember that Hamann confessed that he could not\nconceive of a Creative Spirit without genitalia; indeed, he was quite\nhappy to assert that the genitals are the unique bond between creature\nand Creator. So sexuality in divine-human relations has two aspects.\nFirst, as paradigm of creativity, it is the way in which our\nGod-likeness can most strikingly be seen. Secondly, as the point of the\nmost profound unity, it is the locus for our union both with another\nhuman being and with the divine. Provocatively, Hamann sees original\nsin and its rebellion as embodied not in sexuality, but in reason.\nOverweening reason is our attempt to be like God; meanwhile, prudery is\nthe rejection of God's image, while trying to be like God in the wrong\nsense (bodilessness). (See Essay of a Sibyl on Marriage and Konxompax.)\nOne should therefore distinguish ‘likeness to God’ from\n‘being equal to God’. In the Sibyl's essay, the male\nversion of grasping at equality with God (cf. Phil. 2:6) is the attempt\nto be self-sufficient, to be the God of monotheism: the sole ruler, who\npossesses self-existence. Instead, the encounter with the opposite sex\nshould engender in the man an attitude of profound respect towards the\nwoman's body, as the source of his own existence, from his mother. As\nthe source of his own joy, lovemaking also is an acknowledgement of his\nown dependence, his lack of self-sufficiency and autonomy. But this\ndependence on another paradoxically is the Godlikeness of the Creator,\nthe father, the one who humbles himself in self-giving (a favourite\nHamannian theme in his discussion of God). Meanwhile, the woman's\ntemptation is to an artificial innocence; a secret envy of God's\nincorporeality and impassibility. The defence of one's virginity is\nanother cryptic attempt at self-sufficiency. Instead, the woman must\nbrave the ‘tongues of fire’ in a ‘sacrifical offering\nof innocence’, in order to realize her Godlikeness; which is not\nto be found in bodilessness and the absence of passion, but in\npassionate creativity; in the willingness to be incarnate. Thus, if\nhuman beings are in the image of God, it is a trinitarian image of God,\na mutual relation of love of ‘Father’, ‘Son’\nand ‘Spirit’; found in creating, in saving, and in tongues\nof fire.","contact.mail":"ggd@lokahi.org.uk","contact.domain":"lokahi.org.uk"}]
