Like other long-established cultures the world over, the\nAkan have developed a rich conceptual system complete with\nmetaphysical, moral, and epistemological aspects. Of particular\ninterest is the Akan conception of persons, a conception that\ninforms a variety of social institutions, practices, and judgments\nabout personal identity, moral responsibility, and the proper\nrelationship both among individuals and between individuals and\ncommunity.\n\n\n\nThis overview presents the Akan conception of persons as seen by two\nmajor contemporary Akan philosophers, Kwasi Wiredu and Kwame\nGyekye. These scholars present two very different accounts of the\nconcept, particularly with respect to the relationship between social\nrecognition and innate characteristics to personhood. Examining the\nAkan conception of personhood from these two different perspectives\nhighlights both the richness of the conception as well as the myriad\nways in which the resulting conception contrasts with Western\nconceptions. Among those contrasts are four on which we focus below:\n(1) the continuous nature of personhood, (2) the means by which\nindividuals achieve full personhood, and the implications of this\nconception of personhood for (3) the relationship between individuals\nand the community and (4) the Akan understanding of responsibility and\nfreedom.\n\n\n\nThe debate between Wiredu and Gyekye provides insights regarding not\njust the substance of the conception of personhood, but also the way\nempirical evidence can be used to inform philosophical analysis. In\nthis particular case, the Akan view of personhood has, like many other\nmetaphysical and moral conceptions, far-reaching effects on social\npractices and institutions. Using facts about these practices and\ninstitutions to reconstruct a conception of personhood underscores\nanother important general theme in African philosophy: the practical\nimplications of philosophical principles on everyday life. For the\nAkan, judgments about personhood are not matter of merely academic\ninterest, but play an important role in shaping and supporting their\nhighly communal social structure. To the extent that the Akan notion\naccommodates a common humanity as an innate source of value, it\nsupports moral equality. At the same time, its emphasis on the social\nbases of personhood helps firmly to embed trust, cooperation, and\nresponsibility to the community in cultural practices. The Akan\nphilosophy of persons thus represents an attempt to resolve questions\nof identity, freedom, and morality in favor of a communalistic way of\nlife that has evolved as a rational adaptation to the exigencies of\nsurvival under harsh conditions.\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to express the essence of the Akan concept of persons,\nKwasi Wiredu refers to former Zambian President Kaunda's praise\nof former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as “truly a\nperson.” The concept of person to which Kaunda referred has a\nparticular significance within the African cultural context. As Kaunda\nexplains, “personhood is not an automatic quality of the human\nindividual; it is something to be achieved, the higher the\nachievement, the higher the credit” (Wiredu 1992, 104).  The\nview of personhood as a matter of degrees, as exemplified in\nKaunda's remark, is also a defining characteristic of the Akan\nnotion of personhood. \n\nThe Akan word onipa is an ambiguous term, sometimes referring\nto a member of a biological species and sometimes referring instead to\na human who has attained a special kind of social status (Wiredu\n1992).  According to Wiredu, this dual meaning reflects an important\nconceptual distinction between a human—a biological\nentity—and a person—an entity with special moral\nand metaphysical qualities. Status as a human is not susceptible to\ndegrees, nor is such status conferred on an individual as a\n‘reward’ for her efforts. One is either a human or one is\nnot—there is no such thing as becoming a human. In\ncontrast, personhood is something for a human to become to different\ndegrees through individual achievement. An individual's human\n status, then, is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for\n personhood.[1] \n\nUnder this interpretation, the ‘payoff’ for attaining\nhigher degrees of personhood is directly related to rights and\nprivileges that can make a significant difference between success\n and\n failure.[2]\n The more\nrights and privileges an individual enjoys, the more social capital\nthat individual acquires (in the form of access to lineal networks and\nthe resources they control). A person—taken in its fullest\nsense—is therefore an individual who, through mature reflection\nand action, has both flourished economically and succeeded in meeting\nher (often weighty) responsibilities to her family and community. \n\nThe distinctive qualities of this concept of persons (as interpreted by\nWiredu) are brought out when contrasted to the analysis of another\nleading African philosopher, Kwame Gyekye, who takes issue with this\ngraduated conception of person. Gyekye specifically objects to the role\nthat social status plays in Wiredu's view of personhood, arguing\nthat that is inconsistent with the natural or innate moral equality of\npersons derived from their common humanity. That is, we are human\npersons before we are anything else and it is the human person that\nmatters from the moral point of view. Not surprisingly, Gyekye quotes\nKant's categorical imperative approvingly when arguing that human\npersons are, as members of the ‘kingdom of ends,’ equal\nindependent of their empirical or accidental characteristics (be they\nsocial or even genetic qualities. \n\nAccording to Gyekye, it is our essentially human capacity for\nreason—not other fortuitous or accidental predicates—that\nserves as the basis for moral worth. In this respect, one cannot point\nto such accidental characteristics as height, gender, age, marital\nstatus, or social class as basis for personhood: \n\nGyekye is quick to note that there are some Akan expressions and\njudgments about the life and conduct of people that appear to give the\nimpression that personhood is something that is acquired or bestowed\nupon one in virtue of taken responsibility in the community. For\nexample, Onnye ‘nipa is a moral judgmental expression\nused among the Akan to describe someone who appears in his conduct to\nbe wicked, bad, and ungenerous to others. In fact, a person of high\nmoral standards or conduct would be described approvingly as oye\nonipa paa—literally, she is a real (human) person. In\ncontrast, an individual who fails in his striving in the Akan community\nmay be judged as onipa hun, which literally means\n“useless person,” an opprobrious expression. \n\nAccording to Gyekye, however, these locutions should not be taken\nliterally, but instead merely to reflect “status, habits, and\npersonality or character traits” that one acquires over the\ncourse of the one's life, not personhood (Wiredu & Gyekye\n1992, 108).  For Gyekye, personhood is prior to and independent of\nsuch acquisitions. To conceive of personhood as a continuous property\ncapable of degrees is to confuse conventional notions of\nstatus—a highly variable quantity—with the notion of\npersonhood, a constant for all human persons. \n\nThe relationship between Wiredu's and Gyekye's analyses of\npersonhood is brought out more clearly by considering the status of\ninfants, vis-a-vis personhood. Akan linguistic conventions distinguish\ninfants from full persons on the basis of their lacking intellectual\nand moral maturity. This aspect reflects the continuous character of\npersonhood stressed by Wiredu. Yet the infant (or onipa) is\nalso accorded a baseline level of respect by virtue of her possessing\nthe okra. In that respect, an infant is entitled to the\nrespect due to any other human, regardless of age, or\n capability. (Wiredu & Gyekye 1992) \n\nAs interpreted by Wiredu, these conventions clearly indicate that\ncertain kinds of achievements—be they moral, intellectual, or\nsocial—are, for the Akan, constitutive of personhood,\nnot merely indicators of such status. But at the same time, Wiredu\ntakes those conventions to indicate the importance of the\ninfant's status as a human, since it entitles the\ninfant—and, for that matter, all other humans—to a minimum\nlevel of respect. The significance of humanity, he argues, is that it\nis a necessary (albeit not a sufficient) condition for personhood. From\nWiredu's perspective, possession of the okra confers one\ncondition of self-respect, not self-respect itself. To acquire\nself-respect itself, one must build upon that basis to achieve greater\ndegrees of moral agency, and in so doing, achieving greater degrees of\npersonhood. \n\nThe difference in status between those possessing merely the\nokra and those who have achieved a higher degree of personhood\ncan be thought of in terms of the difference between the quality of\nmoral agency and degrees of moral responsibility.\nAmong the Akan, phrases like onye’ nipa (“he is\nnot a person”) or onipa hun (“useless\nperson”) indicate that an individual is a moral agent, one that\nis equal to all others with respect to having the potential for full\npersonhood—albeit a potential that the individual has not\nrealized. In fact, to pass a judgment that someone is an\nonye’ nipa is a way of respecting the person as a moral\nagent; not holding an adult responsible in this way would be tantamount\nto failing to respect their moral agency. \n\nThe two levels of personhood (one discrete, the other continuous)\nposited by Wiredu allows him to account for much of the social and\nlinguistic data while also satisfying many of the moral intuitions\nunderlying Gyekye's own purely discrete interpretation. Think\nagain, for example, about the concept of a human being. As explicated\nby Wiredu, what makes an entity a human being is simply his or her\npossession of the okra. This can be translated into\nGyekye's Kantian parlance as the claim that one's status as\nnot just a human being but as a moral agent rests solely on one's\ncapacity for reason. The normative implication of possession of the\nokra or the capacity for rationality is that the entity is\nentitled to an irreducible respect matched by irreducible\nrights—like the negative right not to be killed unjustly, or the\npositive right to be given what is needed to sustain life. The social\nbases of personhood supplement this minimum level of inherent\nrespect. In this wise one can say that all persons are human\nbeings but not all human beings are persons. At bottom, all human\nbeings are potential moral agents. This is a status (capacity for\nrationality and morality) that a colt cannot be accorded because even a\nhorse cannot become a moral agent. An infant can. \n\nThe implications of the two-tiered view of personhood presented by\nWiredu are nicely illustrated by Akan practices following the death of\nan infant. Despite the obviously tragic circumstances of such a death,\nno funeral ceremonies are permitted in Akan society for infants.\nAccording to Wiredu, the reason for this naturally follows from the\nminimal level of personhood achieved by infants: It isn't that\ninfants are not valued or cherished by the Akan; rather, it is that\nthey are just not the kind of individual for whom such a ceremony is\nappropriate. The Akan funeral is a form of send-off for the departing\nsoul on the journey to the ancestral world—a journey for which a\nchild does not qualify because she hasn't attained personhood.\nThus, the death of a child is not a time for mourning. Instead, parents\nare expected to behave normally and cheerfully. \n\nThe different treatment accorded to deceased adults and children is a\nmanifestation of what we can refer to as the Akan theory of selective\nreincarnation, a view that postulates that otherwise deserving humans\nwho have failed to fulfill their potential for achieving a higher\ndegree of personhood a second chance in the\n world.[3]\n For the Akan, those who die in\ninfancy are obvious candidates for this form of reincarnation, since\nthey have failed to make good on their potential but not through any\nlack of effort on their part. In that respect they are what Wiredu\ncalls ‘limbo people,’ humans with an untapped potential for\nfull personhood and the opportunity to return to life to make good on\nthat potential. \n\nOn its face, the theory of selective reincarnation may appear to be\nnothing more than a curious feature of Akan cosmology. As presented by\nWiredu, however, it is part of a general process of making moral\nagents. Appreciating the role of selective reincarnation among the Akan\nthus requires acknowledging the whole process by which morally\nresponsible agents come to be, as well as how individuals become\nmotivated to be moral. Critical to this appreciation is the\nunderstanding that the entity underlying this process exists beyond the\nlife of a physical human being. The okra that forms the\n‘core’ of the human being (and the returns through the\nprocess of selective reincarnation) precedes one's life as a\nhuman and constitutes one end of this process. At the other end\nis the Akan ancestor, the culmination of the process of becoming a\nperson whose memory serves as a moral exemplar to the living that\nguides the moral journey of the Akan. Those who become ancestors are\nthose who, through their imagination, intelligence, and empathetic\nidentification with their fellow human beings, excel not in spite of\nbut because of all the challenges that are put before them. After\nhaving lived a full life, they obtain their ‘ticket’ (to\nuse Wiredu's imagery) to the ancestral world and are reincarnated\ninto service-ancestors. \n\nGyekye rejects this explanation, along with Wiredu's analysis of\nAkan personhood. He argues instead that any such explanation of Akan\nsocial and linguistic conventions must presume the personhood of even\nthe youngest human: \n\nFor Gyekye, then, differences with respect to personhood cannot\naccount for the difference in how the Akan deal with the death of\ninfants and adults. He prefers instead to account for these differences\nin terms of the utilitarian value of cultural practices such as the\ndifferent treatment of the deaths of infants and adults. The most\nobvious reason for the difference, according to Gyekye, is that the\nsize and magnitude of death celebration depends on the social status of\nthe deceased\n individual.[4]\n The death of a wealthy and well-connected\nperson will naturally call for a more elaborate ceremony than the death\nof a newborn, quite independently of their status as persons. \n\nThis is not to say that Gyekye denies the role that the idea\nof reincarnation plays for the Akan in the formation of persons. For\nhim, however, the idea of reincarnation (and of the graduated concept\nof personhood) is less a factual account of personhood than a moral\nnarrative, such as the ones postulated by Aquinas, Kant, Bentham, and\nJohn Stuart Mill to explain and justify moral precepts. The central\nnarratives of Western moral philosophy (such as the social contract)\nprovide vivid images that motivate individuals to act in certain ways.\nIn the same way, the Akan narratives of reincarnation and personhood\nserve to reinforce socially valuable traits and practices such as\ncooperation and industriousness. \n\nFrom this perspective, the sage Akan elders who insure death\ncelebrations for full persons grasp what a casual onlooker might often\noverlook—namely, that the most important effects of a death\ncelebration are on the onlookers, rather than the deceased. What might\nbe called the expressive content of public action—the message to\nthe Akan community conveyed by the ritual and symbolic performance, the\npublic utterances of the Akan leaders—is the most important\neffect of such ceremonies. These ceremonies are a powerful symbolic\nmechanism for both expressing and shaping the values and beliefs of the\nAkan people. Thus, the Akan may abstain from mourning a rapist or a\nmurderer to express their collective abhorrence of the offending\nact. \n\nThe criteria for achieving personhood in Akan society are based on two\nkinds of considerations. The first is the natural fact that we tend to\ncare for our kin and feel responsible for those with whom we are in\nclose reciprocal relationships. The second is that societies need some\nway to encourage and support members' feelings of empathy for\nthose beyond their families. \n\nAccording to Wiredu, in Akan society marriage and procreation are a\nnecessary, but not a sufficient condition of personhood. It is\nimportant that an individual's household be administered by a\njoint equal partnership of spouses and that the children are healthy\nand well nourished. If an individual were to take responsibility for\nthe upbringing of distant relatives or were to shoulder the burden of\nrearing non-relatives and allow his household to become a magnet for\nrelatives and extended family, then such an individual will score very\nhigh in personhood, as indicated by references to him as oye\n‘nipa, meaning, he is “a real person” indeed.\nAccording to Wiredu, \n\nIndividuals failing to meet these standards attract opprobrium.\nOther members of Akan society will point to them and say\nonnye’ nipa (“he is not a real person”). As\na literal rendition from the Akan language, this expression could\nsimply mean that the person is not doing her part. \n\nCriteria pertaining to one's relationship to those in the\ncommunity beyond one's immediate family include being an active\nand unstinted participant in community projects (such as building\nbridges, constructing roads, and cleaning public spaces, as well as\nattending to the death, burial and mourning of a deceased member of the\ncommunity). Along with activity in community projects is involvement in\ncivic rituals (such as fellowship associations, rotating credit groups,\nextended family gatherings, secret societies, hunting groups, village\nwatch groups, and civil militia groups) that have face-to-face\nmeetings. Requiring participation in these practices, in effect, solves\nwhat economists refer to as “free rider” problems by\nallowing information about each person's efforts and\ncontributions to spread quickly through the community. Everyone takes\nmental note of those missing from such events and repeated\nfoot-dragging during community work is rebuked. Although the emphasis\nis on negative scoring, when individuals score very high they receive\ncommunity titles that, on their death, bestows upon them special honors\nfrom other members. These departed individuals are treated as living on\nin a social sense, reincarnated in the ancestral world where they\ncontinue to guard the living. While there is no limit to how high one\ncan rise on the scale that indicates degrees of personhood achieved,\nthere is a limit to how far one can fall. \n\nAn adult ‘do little’ might descend to the level of simply a\nhuman with only the basic dignity and the unconditional rights inherent\nin that status. The fall ends there, because all individuals possess an\nokra which sets a lower bounds on how far they may descend on\nthe scale of personhood. In this sense all humans have moral value that\nentitles them to basic dignity and unconditional rights whether they\nhave attained personhood or not. \n\nWiredu's critics have argued that he fails to recognize that\nindividuals have their own wills and can, at least to some degree,\nchoose their own goals. His position seems to endorse a form of\n‘tyranny’ of the community over the individual. Gyekye\ninsists that this is wrong—both descriptively and normatively\n(Wiredu & Gyekye 1992, 105 note 20).  He agrees that “the\nwhole gamut of values and practices in which the individual is\nnecessarily embedded is a creation of cultural community and is part\nof his history” and that this indicates a close relationship\nbetween the communal structure and individual's goals (Wiredu\n& Gyekye 1992, 112 note 20).  Yet this close relationship hardly\nimplies that the communal structure is the only factor the individual\nis required to consider in analyzing these goals.  According to\nGyekye, \n\nBy reserving for individuals at least the potential for responding to\nor rejecting the communal consensus, Gyekye locates a source of\nidentity that is in some meaningful way independent of any particular\nsociety. This is a self that can “participate in the\n determination or definition of its own \n identity.”[5]\n (Wiredu & Gyekye 1992, 112). \n\nGyekye correctly recognizes that the possibility of self-criticism\nrequires that one be able to distance oneself from one's own community\nor circumstances: However, it is not clear that this is a particularly\nserious problem for Wiredu's account, for even Wiredu allows that\nindividuals can critically assess their communal values. It is, after\nall, this ability to look at one's culture with new (and critical)\neyes that makes moral reformers (of which there have been many among\nthe Akan) possible. These moral reformers may stand against the\ncommunal values but the ones that may make an impact and be selected\nfor reincarnation as an ancestor is one that give reasons to\nreject or revise values that persuade the community. Understood in\nthis way, moral reformers not only have a place in Akan society, but\nqualify as persons with secured ‘tickets’ to the ancestral\nworld. \n\nAn important condition for achieving personhood is that the agent has\nthe ability to act on the basis of rational reflection. Wiredu\nindicates what is meant by “damaged personhood” by\npointing out that an Akan adult of unpredictable behavior will bring\nthe judgment that “so-and-so is not a person (onye\n‘onipa),” (Wiredu 1992, 108) a comment that leaves\nopen for further investigation whether the damage was done by\npsychological or environmental factors, or by brute bad\nluck. “The problem in Akan is ‘when is an individual\nresponsible?’ And the answer in this brief account of the Akan\napproach to deviant conduct is that an individual is responsible to\nthe extent that his conduct can be modified through rational\npersuasion or moral correction” (Wiredu 1992, 108–09).\nWiredu concludes that once the cause of the unpredictable behavior is\ndetermined, irresponsibility may change into nonresponsibility, for in\nthe Akan philosophy of person, where there is free will there is\nresponsibility. \n\nSince there is a merit component to personhood, it is relevant to talk\nof the distribution of the opportunity of achieving personhood\nso as to secure respect over and above the threshold respect that is\ndue to human beings in virtue of their status as human beings. Goods\nlike positions of prestige that are conferred to individuals who have\nachieved personhood are limited by their very nature, but given\nequality of opportunity, no person should be denied from the outset the\nchance to secure those goods. Here, then, is a tension, for what does\nthe society do to those who are born handicapped or crippled in such a\nway that they are not in the position to achieve personhood in ways\nthat able bodied people can? What happened to Shijuruh born in a family\nof thieves and in a neighborhood full of burglers? Surely, Shijuruh did\nnot choose to be born in that family much less in the neighborhood and\nthis may affect his performance in an attempt to achieve personhood. In\nother words how does one account for equality in unequal\ncircumstances? \n\nThe answer provided by the Akan, according to Wiredu's\ninterpretation, is to conceive of the status required for personhood as\ndefined relative to an adult individual's starting position or\ninitial capacity. Wiredu explains that, for example, an adult who\nbehaves erratically or in an immature manner would be presumed to have\nfailed to be a full\n person.[6]\n Such a presumption, however, is\nmerely a presumption, an inference drawn from the superficial\nqualities of the individual's action relative to what could be\nexpected of the average individual. If the individual changes his or\nher behavior, that inference may be revised. If, however, the behavior\npersists, the individual's family members may summon an\nexpert—a geomancer—capable of determining if he or she is\nacting out of free will. \n\nProvided that the behavior is found not to be deliberate or that she is\nnot acting from her free will, the community will gather and it will be\nsaid of her a message of this tenure: “It is not her eyes, it is\nnot her head, it is not her mind,” i.e., she is not responsible\nfor her erratic actions. In making this judgment, the community will be\nchanging irresponsibility to non-responsibility. This is the way the Akan\nhas for equalizing background conditions of individuals in their\nattempt at dealing with the difficulties of equality in unequal\ncircumstances. It is against this background that we can begin to make\nsense of Wiredu's claim that freewill and responsibility are two\nsides of the same coin among the Akan. \n\nMany commentators agree with Gyekye that the essential ingredient of a\nhuman is what the Akan refers to as okra.  There is, however,\nsome disagreement over the nature of okra. According to\nGyekye, \n\nWhile Gyekye maintains that okra can be accurately rendered\ninto English as ‘soul,’ Wiredu insists upon drawing a\nsomewhat more subtle distinction between these concepts. For Wiredu\nokra is “that whose presence in the body means life and\nwhose absence means death and which also received the\nindividual's destiny from God” (Wiredu 1983, 119).  Of\npivotal importance to their disagreement is the normative implication\nof the presence of okra. The normative implication is that\nokra bestows on its possessors basic irreducible respect\nmatched by basic irreducible human rights. \n\nLike Wiredu, Gyekye recognizes that there are standards for which\nindividual persons aim that have an important role in how people think\nof themselves and their place in society. Unlike Wiredu, however,\nGyekye denies that facts about a person's ambitions or goals add\nor subtract from that individual's status as a person, \n\nInstead, then, of treating persons as a kind of individual that\nadmits of degrees, Gyekye employs criteria of personhood that are quite\nindependent of individual aims and actions. He maintains that, while\npersons may differ with respect to how they are treated in a community,\nthis difference is a matter of the social status accorded each, not\nfacts about their status as persons.  \n\nPersonhood defined in terms of social achievement and personal\nrelationships aptly serve to establish those networks conducive to\ncreating the flow of information and obligation necessary for the\npromotion of communal trust. So conceived, the Akan notion of\npersonhood helps to support social cooperation and provides a\nframework superbly suited to resolving collective action problems. The\nAkan have fashioned a means of motivating individuals to contribute to\nthe social good while still insuring that the moral value of even the\nmost unproductive individual is retained. For the Akan, personhood is\nthe reward for contributing to the community and the basis of the\nindividual's moral worth is located in an independent source—a\ncommon humanity.","contact.mail":"ajume.wingo@colorado.edu","contact.domain":"colorado.edu"}]
