These range from\nPaleolithic cave painting to postmodern poetry, and from the problem\nof how music can convey emotion to that of the metaphysical status of\nfictional characters. Until recently, however, philosophical interest\nin conceptual art, or conceptualism, has been notably sparse. Why?\nAfter all, both philosophy and the myriad kinds and styles of art\nand art-making that fall under the conceptual tradition all have one\nthing in common: they are both intended to make you think and ask\npressing questions. What are those questions and how do we go about\nanswering them?\n\n\n\nFew artistic movements have attracted so much controversy and debate\nas conceptual art. By its nature, conceptual art has a tendency to\nprovoke intense and perhaps even extreme reactions in its\naudiences. While some people find conceptual art very refreshing and\nrelevant, many others consider it shocking, distasteful, and\nconspicuously lacking in craftsmanship. Some even simply deny that it\nis art at all.  Conceptual art, it seems, is something that we either\nlove or hate.  This divisive character is, however, far from accidental. Most\nconceptual art actively sets out to be controversial in so far as it\nseeks to challenge and probe us about what we tend to take as given in\nthe domain of art. In fact, this capacity to evoke argument and debate\nlies at the very heart of what conceptual art sets out to do, namely\nto make us question our assumptions not only about what may properly\nqualify as art and what the function of the artist should be, but also\nabout what our role as spectators should involve. It should come as no\nsurprise, then, that conceptual art can cause frustration or vexation\n– to raise difficult and sometimes even annoying questions is\nprecisely what conceptual art in general aspires to do. In reacting\nstrongly to conceptual art we are, in some important sense, playing\nright into its hands. \n\nThe first difficulty that a philosophical investigation of conceptual\nart encounters has to do with identifying the object of examination, or\nat least the category of objects under scrutiny. In the words of\nthe art historian Paul Wood, \n\nOn a strict historical reading, the expression ‘conceptual\nart’ refers to the artistic movement that reached its pinnacle\nbetween 1966 and 1972 (Lippard\n 1973).[1]\n Among its most famous adherents at its\nearly stage we find artists such as Joseph Kosuth, Robert Morris,\nJoseph Beuys, Adrian Piper, to name but a few. What unites the\nconceptual art of this period is the absorption of the lessons learnt\nfrom other twentieth-century art movements such as Dadaism,\nSurrealism, Suprematism, Abstract Expressionism and the Fluxus group,\ntogether with the ambition once and for all to ‘free’\nart of the Modernist paradigm. Most importantly, perhaps, conceptual\nart of the 1960s and 70s sought to overcome a backdrop against which\nart’s principal aim is to produce something beautiful or aesthetically\npleasing. Art, early conceptual artists held, is redundant if it does\nnot make us think. In their belief that most artistic institutions\nwere not conducive to reflection but merely promoted a conservative and even consumerist\nconception of art and artists, conceptual artists in the mid-1960s to\nthe early 1970s instead tried to encourage a revisionary understanding\nof art, the artist, and artistic experience. \n\nWhile conceptual art in its purest form might arguably be limited to\nworks produced during these five or six years nearly half a century\nago, it seems overly narrow – certainly from a philosophical\nperspective – to limit our inquiry to works produced during that\nperiod alone. For although the work created during that time might\ngenerally be conceived as more directly anti-establishment and\nanti-consumerist than later conceptual art, the spirit of early\nconceptual art seems to have carried on relatively undiluted into the\nvery late twentieth and twenty-first centuries, as witnessed by pieces\nsuch as Tracey Emin’s Unmade Bed, Damian Hirst’s The\nPhysical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living, Ai Weiwei’s Surveillance Camera, and Jake and Dinos Chapman’s Chapman Family Collection. \n\nThe highly individualised character of the intellectual exploration\nthat conceptual art urges us to engage in has always been such that\nany attempt to pinpoint a specific common denominator other than this\ngeneral vision and approach to art, art-making and society at large\ninvariably fails to catch its very essence. The means of artistic\nexpression, we are told, are infinite and the topics available for\nquestioning and discussion are limitless. It belongs to the very\nnature of conceptual art, then, to be – like Lewis’ Cheshire cat\n– elusive and slippery. Conceptual artists, be it Joseph Beuys\nor Marina Abramovic, pursue artistic originality and representation in\nevery possible way. For that reason, one might find oneself\nobliged to replace the slightly lofty cliché according to which\nthere are as many definitions of conceptual art as there are\nconceptual artists, with an even more extreme version of the claim,\nnamely, that there are as many definitions of conceptual art as there\nare conceptual artworks. \n\nNevertheless, in the midst of this deliberately produced uncertainty\nabout the nature of conceptual art, a handful of characteristics and\ngeneral aims do seem to recur, and although they should not be seen as\ncriteria for conceptual art strictly speaking, they may be considered\ntenets fundamental to (most) conceptual art. \n\nFirst and foremost, conceptual art challenges our intuitions\nconcerning the limits of what may count as art and what it is an artist\ndoes. It does so,\non the one hand, by postulating ever more complex objects as candidates\nfor the status of ‘artwork’, and, on the other hand, by\ndistancing the task of the artist from the actual making and\nmanipulating of the artistic material. \n\nA characteristic way in which conceptual art explores the boundaries\nof the artwork is by a process of questioning where the realm of the\nartistic ends and that of utility begins. Continuing the tradition of\nMarcel Duchamp’s readymades such as Fountain, or\nBottlerack, it sets out to overthrow our traditional\nconceptions of what an art object should be made of and what it should\nlook like. The artwork is a process rather than a\nmaterial thing, and as such it is no longer something that\ncan be grasped merely by seeing, hearing or touching the end product\nof that process. The notion of agency in art-making is thus\nparticularly emphasised. In many cases, the ‘art-making’\nand the ‘artwork’ come together, because what is sought is\nan identification of the notion of the work of art with the conceptual\nactivity of the artist. Conceptual art, politicised and influenced by\nevents such as the ‘May Days’ in Paris (1968), the\n‘Hot Autumn’ in Italy (1969), the Vietnam War, and the\nrise of feminism, promotes a rapprochement between art-making\nand criticism – both artistic and social – by raising\nquestions about the products of artistic activities and the very\npurpose of art. To use the words of Joseph Kosuth, it ‘annexes\nthe functions of the critic, and makes a middle-man\nunnecessary.’ (Guercio 1999, 39). \n\nAs a direct result of its examination of what may properly qualify as\nart, and of the markedly broad conception of what may constitute an\nart object resulting from this examination, conceptual art tends\nto reject traditional artistic media such as conventional painting or\nsculpture. Instead, it has found itself drawn to alternative means of\nexpression, including performances, photography, films, videos,\nevents, bodies, new ready-mades and new mixed media. In a nutshell\nnothing can be ruled out in principle for use as possible artistic\nmedia, as can be seen, for example, in Richard Long’s photograph of a\nline made in the grass by\n walking[2],\n Bruce Nauman’s nine minute film of the artist himself playing one note\non a violin whilst walking around in his\n studio[3], \n Janine Antoni’s use of chocolate and soap, Marina\nAbramovic’s display of an array of everyday objects, including\nknives, torches and feathers, which the audience is invited to apply\ndirectly on to the artist’s body, and Piero Manzoni’s act\nof signing a woman’s\n arm[4]. \n\nThe most fundamentally revisionary feature of conceptual art is the\nway in which it proclaims itself to be an art of the mind rather than\nthe senses: it rejects traditional artistic media because it locates\nthe artwork at the level of ideas rather than that of\nobjects. Because creative process tends to be given more\nweight than physical material, and because art should be about\nintellectual inquiry and reflection rather than beauty and aesthetic\npleasure (as traditionally conceived), the identity of the work of art\nis said to lie in the idea at the heart of the piece in question. In\nthe words of Kosuth, ‘[t]he actual works of art are ideas’\n(Lippard 1973, 25). For conceptual art, ‘the idea or concept is\nthe most important aspect of the work’ (LeWitt 1967, 166). Art\nis ‘de-materialised’, and in this sense held to be prior\nto its materialisation in any given object.  \n\nThe claim that the conceptual artwork is to be identified with\nan idea that may be seen to underlie it has far-reaching\nramifications. It not only affects the ontology of the conceptual\nartwork but also profoundly alters the role of the artist by casting\nher in the role of thinker rather than object-maker. Moreover, it\ncalls for a thorough review of the way in which we perceive, engage and\nappreciate artworks. Further still, it links art so intimately to\nideas and concepts that even a principled distinction between the\ndomain of art and the realm of thought seems difficult to\npreserve.\n\n \n\nFor all these reasons, the kind of representation employed in\nconceptual artworks is best described in terms of the transmission of\nideas. In conceptual art, the representation at work can generally be\nseen as semantic rather than illustrative.  That is\nto say, it sets out to have and convey a specific meaning rather than\nto depict a scene, person or event. Even in cases where a work makes\nuse of illustrative representation, conceptual art is still putting\nthat representation to a distinctively semantic use, in the sense of\nthere being an intention to represent something one cannot see with\nthe naked eye. Accordingly, the conceptual artist’s task is to\ncontemplate and formulate this meaning – to be a\n‘meaning-maker’. \n\nThe philosophical concerns raised by conceptual art can be divided\ninto two main categories. First, there are specific questions to do\nwith conceptual art itself, and the claims which underpin the project\nthat drives it. Philosophical investigations might thus be called for\nnot only in relation to the internal consistency and coherence of the\nproject and its set goals, but also with regards to the particular\ntenets outlined above. For example, what does it mean to say that\nevery single thing, person or event is a possible candidate for an\nartistic medium and does that suggestion not render the category of\nart, as we know it, redundant?  \n\nSecond, conceptual art poses philosophical problems from a wider\nperspective, in so far as one might expect philosophy to provide us\nwith unitary accounts of the nature of art, the role of the artist, and\nartistic experience. In many important respects, conceptual art\nsits very uncomfortably with other, often more traditional artforms and\nartworks, and this tension highlights a pressing issue for anyone\ninterested in the possibility of a universal theory of art. For\nif there is to be one rule for conceptual art and another for all\nother kinds of art, are there still good grounds for thinking of\nconceptual art as a kind of art? Moreover, could not every\nparticular kind of artform or artwork demand a separate theory of art,\nartist and artistic experience?  If we are to sidestep such an intrinsic division between\nconceptual art on the one hand, and other kinds of art on the other,\nthen theories concerned mainly with art that is not conceptual will\nhave to make many significant concessions in order to incorporate the\nproblematic case that conceptual artworks present. At the very least,\na compromise will have to be reached concerning what we mean by the\nterm ‘artwork’. \n\nOne of the over-riding concerns that beset the philosophy of conceptual\nart is thus whether and, if so, why one should actively pursue unified\naccounts in the philosophy of art. Whether one comes out of that\ninvestigation embracing a broader – albeit perhaps vaguer –\nset of concepts and tools than one started off with, or whether one\nconsiders oneself forced to abandon any hope of anything but very\nspecific theories of art, artist, and artistic experience, conceptual\nart obliges us to think about where we stand on these issues. \n\nPhilosophizing about conceptual art is, then, not merely philosophizing\nabout one specific artform. It is philosophizing about the most\nrevisionary kind of art, one that sees its own task as being profoundly\nphilosophical in nature. Let us now turn to five more specific\nphilosophical themes that conceptual art urges us to\nconsider. \n\nThe problem of defining art is by no means a problem for conceptual\nart alone. Two principal difficulties immediately arise in the context\nof any attempt to form a definition. First, the category of art is\nparticularly heterogeneous. Simply put, there seems to be an infinite\nvariety of things, or kinds of thing, that need to fall under its\njurisdiction. Second, there is great variety of opinion on what any\nputative definition of art should actually consist of.  \n\nOn the standard conception, a definition is something\nthat provides us with necessary and sufficient conditions for some\nthing x to be F, so that, for example, it is a necessary and\nsufficient condition for a number to be an even number that it is (i)\nan integer and (ii) divisible by two. Accordingly, a\ndefinition of art must be capable of outlining a clear set of\nconditions that must be satisfied. \n\nThere have been no shortages of attempts to define art in this\nmanner. Most prominently perhaps, it has been suggested that art ought\nto be defined in terms of its aesthetic character, so that, roughly,\nx is an artwork if and only if x gives rise to an\naesthetic experience (e.g., Beardsley 1958).  Notwithstanding the\ndifficulties that this particular suggestion entails (we shall return\nto this in §3.3), the advent of a kind of art that is as\nprofoundly revisionary and difficult to classify as conceptual art\nrenders the attempt to provide a general definition applicable to\nall art particularly complex. It is no coincidence, then,\nthat a neo-Wittgensteinian approach came to dominate the philosophy of\nart in the late 1950s and 1960s. Drawing support from\nanti-essentialist theories of language, it was suggested that art was\nnumbered among the various concepts that are, by their very nature,\n‘essentially contested’ (Gallie 1948; see also Weitz\n1956).  That is to say, some concepts – such as that pertaining\nto sports, for example– simply do not allow for definitions in\nterms of necessary and sufficient conditions, and art is best as\nunderstood as one of them. In the words of Morris Weitz, art may\nbe \n\nThe act of proposing a definition of art thus becomes a less stringent\nexercise of conceptual analysis. The alternative method proposed by\nneo-Wittgensteinians such as Weitz in attempting to identify art and\nexplain how we are to distinguish it from non-art is the notion of\nfamily resemblance (see Wittgenstein 1953, §66–71).\nFaced with the question ‘Is X an artwork?’, what\nwe should do is try to detect strands of resemblance with paradigmatic\ninstances of an artwork. If some significant resemblance to such a\nparadigmatic case is observed, we can rightly call the object of our\nscrutiny a work of art. \n\nThe proposal, though interesting, is not without its own\ndifficulties. One problem that immediately arises relates to the idea\nof resemblance itself, and the way it rapidly expands in such a way as\nto render it close to useless. This is for the simple reason that\nwe can always find some way in which some given thing may be\nsaid to resemble any other given thing. This kind of openness, it is\nimportant to note, is not something that fits in with the\nprogramme of conceptual art. Whilst conceptual art does hold that any\nkind of object could be a work of art, it is not\nsaying that every object is a work of art. Far from it. Much\nconceptual art, in exploring the boundaries between the realms of the\nartistic and that of function and utility, is perceptually\nindistinguishable from non-art, such as Andy Warhol’s Brillo\nBoxes. In that sense, conceptual art presents a particularly\ndifficult case for the neo-Wittgensteinian method of\nidentification. After all, the only way in which Warhol’s Brillo Boxes\ndoes not resemble any other stack of Brillo Boxes is the\nsense in which the former is a work of art and the latter is not. The\nnotion of resemblance is clearly of little use here. \n\nPicking up on this concern, Arthur Danto has famously suggested that\nit is in fact a non-manifest relation that makes something an artwork\nrather than an observable property (Danto 1981). That is to say,\nartworks acquire that status in virtue of their relations to the\nhistorical and social setting constituted by the practices and\nconventions of art, our artistic heritage, the intentions of artists,\nand so on — the ‘artworld’ (see also Dickie\n1974).The general idea here is that artworks are generated within a\nsocial and artistic context, and so being an artwork is a function of\ncertain social relations. Conceptual art reinforces the idea that art\nand non-art can be perceptually indistinguishable and so cannot be\nmarked off from each other by ‘exhibited’ properties\n alone.[5] \n\nSetting aside the details of such an account, one of the things\nconceptual art has helped philosophers to grasp more fully is that any\nsuccessful general definition, or indeed principled theory of the\nidentification of art, will need to have the non-manifest properties\nof artworks at its centre. It is the meaning that the artist infuses\ninto the work and the meaning that we as audience stand to gain from\nit that contains the key to its status as art (more on this in\n§3.4). To use the example of Warhol’s Brillo Boxes\nagain, the work of the conceptual artist seems primarily to be the\nwork of imbuing objects with a particular kind of meaning.  A more promising line of enquiry has been developed by David\nDavies. Taking his cue from the problems posed by conceptual art,\nDavies argues that a unified definition of art can only be found if we\nthink of art primarily in terms of the creative process or series of\nactions resulting in a material thing or other ‘focus of\nappreciation’. In that sense, the artwork is primiarly\nidentified with the intentional acts through which it comes into being\nrather than with the end-product of that process (Davies 2004). Art,\non this view, is better understood as a kind of performance than as a\nmanifest object. By shifting the focus of our attention in this way,\nwe can overcome many of the difficulties associated with defining art,\nmost notably that of its heterogeneity. It may be, then, that the most\nenduring lesson to be learnt from conceptual art with regards to the\ndefinition of art is not so much that a conceptual analysis of art is\ncompletely unattainable, as that we simply have been looking in the\nwrong place.  The claim that conceptual art is to be identified less with a\nperceivable object than with the meaning or idea it aims to convey,\ngives rise to a host of complex ontological questions. The rejection\nof traditional artistic media, together with the de-materialisation of\nthe art object, forces us to reconsider what seemed to be relatively\nuncomplicated aspects of artistic experience. The answers to questions\nsuch as ‘Is there in fact any one thing (or set of things) that\nwe must perceive in artistic appreciation?’, and ‘Is it a\nnecessary condition for the existence of an artwork that it have a\nmedium?’ suddenly become a good deal less obvious.  \n\nIn the first instance, conceptual art drives us to review the common\nassumption that appropriate appreciation and engagement with an artwork\nmust involve a direct first-hand experience of that piece itself.\nThe idea here, to use Frank Sibley’s words, is that \n\nThe assumption in question is, then, that although we seem to gain\nsomething from looking at, for example, a postcard or poster of\nLeonardo da Vinci’s La Gioconda or Élisabeth\nVigée Le Brun’s Self-Portrait in a Straw Hat , a\ngenuine judgement about its artistic character necessitates one’s own\nun-mediated perceptual experience of it. But – and herein lies\nthe crux of the problem for conceptual art – what if there is\nnothing for us to get a first-hand perceptual experience of? In the\ncase of Walter De Maria’s\nVertical Earth Kilometer\n (1977)[6],\n a kilometre-long metal shaft plunged into\nthe surface of the earth so that only the very top is visible,\nfirst-hand perceptual experience is simply not something that can be\nhad. More pertinently, what does it even mean to have a perceptual\nengagement with an artwork that claims, basically, to be an idea?\n \n\nPerhaps the most pressing question, however, has to do with\nthe extent to which we are to take conceptual art’s claim of\nde-materialisation seriously. Does the de-materialisation of such\nart not suggest that there is not only a rejection of traditional\nartistic media in conceptual art, but an outright refutation of\nartistic media in general? One possible way of making sense of this idea\nis with a distinction outlined\nby Davies, namely that between physical medium and vehicular\nmedium (Davies 2004). Crucially, a vehicular medium is said to\nincorporate not only physical objects (such as paintings and\nsculptures, say) but also actions, events, and generally more complex\nentities. In\nDavies’ words, ‘[t]he product of an artist’s\nmanipulation of a vehicular medium will then be the vehicle\nwhereby a particular artistic statement is articulated… The\nvehicle may, as in the case of Picasso’s Guernica, be a\nphysical object, or, as in the case of Coleridge’s Kubla\nKahn, a linguistic structure-type, or, as arguably in the case of\nDuchamp’s Fountain, an action of a particular\nkind.’ (Davies 2004, 59). Adhering to this vehicular\nmedium in art, may then at least equip philosophers with a notion that\ncan deflate the concern of whether conceptual art, by rejecting\nphysical media, denies the need for all artistic media.\n \n\nClearly, conceptual art is not the first kind of art to raise\nontological concerns of this kind. After all, music and literary art,\nbe it traditional or avant-garde, hardly present\nstraightforward cases either. The question of what exactly\nconstitutes, say, a novel or a musical work have been widely discussed\nfor some time (e.g. Davies 2001; Ingarden 1973; Wollheim 1980)\nBuilding on the suggestion that artworks such as musical pieces and\nliterary works are best understood in terms of universals or\n‘types’, one view that has been widely discussed in the\nlast two decades or so is based on the idea that not only musical and\nliterary artworks, but all artworks, are types. More\nspecifically, they are to be conceived of as ‘event- or\naction-types’ (Currie 1988). According to this theory, the\nartwork is thus not the material thing itself but, rather, the way in\nwhich the artist arrived at the underlying structure shared by all\ninstances or performances of that work.  \n\nWhilst the general approach fostered by both Currie and Davies is\nclearly congenial to some aspects of conceptual art, it might\nnevertheless still be the case that further work needs to be done if\nthe view that artworks are basically event- or action-types is to\naccommodate all art in the conceptual tradition. Further questions\ninclude what role, if any, is played by the (set of) material thing(s)\nthat many conceptual artists undeniably do present us\nwith. What, in other words, are we to make of the object (be it a\nhuman body or a video-recording) that is supposed to transmit the idea\nwhich, in turn, is said to be the genuine artwork? A good\nphilosophical explanation needs to be given as to how the material\nthing that is regularly presented to the audience is, in fact,\nrelevant to the artwork itself. Is the vehicular medium constitutive\nof the artwork, and if so, how exactly does that square with the claim\nof de-materialisation?  \n\nUnderlying the claim that we need to have a direct experiential\nencounter with an artwork in order to appreciate it appropriately is\nthe fact that some of the properties that bear on the value of a\nwork can only be grasped in this way.\nThe properties in question here are generally aesthetic\nproperties, and the assumption motivating the experiential requirement\nis that the appreciation of artworks necessarily involves an aesthetic\nelement (i.e. not necessarily beauty per se, but something\naesthetically pleasing or rewarding).  \n\nHowever, one of the most distinguishing features of conceptual art,\nsetting out as it does to replace illustrative representation with\nsemantic representation, is that it does not prioritise aesthetic\nexperience in a traditional sense.  Conceptual art is intended as an\nart of the mind: it generally appeals to matters of the intellect and\nemphasises art’s cognitive rather than aesthetic\nvalue. In the words of Timothy Binkley, traditional aesthetics is\npreoccupied ‘with perceptual entities’ and this\n‘leads aesthetics to extol and examine the “work of\nart”, while averting its attention almost entirely from the\nmyriad other aspects of that complex cultural activity we call\n“art” ’ (Binkley 1977, 271). \n\nWe can now see that the experiential requirement may well fail to have\nany bite with regards to conceptual artworks because the artist’s aim\ndoes not necessarily involve conferring to the work of art properties\nthat must be experienced directly in order to be grasped and fully\nappreciated. If there is to be any kind of first-hand experiential\nrequirement for the appropriate appreciation of conceptual artworks,\nit will perhaps be of a kind that focuses on an imaginative engagement\nwith the idea central to the artwork rather than a perceptual\nexperience of its aesthetic properties (see Schellekens 2007) \n\nThe main philosophical question highlighted by conceptual art in\nthis context, then, is the following: ‘Does art really need to be\naesthetic, and, if so, in what sense?’. In Binkley’s opinion, and in support of\nconceptual art, one does not necessarily have to think of art in terms\nof aesthetic value –whilst a lot of ‘art has chosen to\narticulate in the medium of an aesthetic space’, there is\n‘no a priori reason why art must confine itself to the creation\nof aesthetic objects. It might opt for articulation in a semantic space\ninstead of an aesthetic one so that artistic meaning is not embodied in\na physical object or event’ (Binkley 1977, 273).  \n\nHowever, not everyone has endorsed such a liberal view about the\nseparation between the aesthetic and the\n artistic[7]. \nIf art does not aim at having aesthetic value, what, one might argue,\nwill set it apart from non-art? Which view one decides to favour on\nthis point may well end up being an issue about definition. If one\nwishes to define art in terms of aesthetic experience, the question\nfinds a clear-cut answer, namely that conceptual art simply cannot be\nconsidered a kind of art.  The down-side of that position is, however,\na whole set of difficult concerns to do with things, such as nature or\npersons, that hardly qualify as art even though they invite aesthetic\nexperiences. If one is impressed by these worries and cannot see any\ndecisive philosophical reason to uphold the aesthetic view, there is\nlittle, if anything, to block a conception of art which is not\nnecessarily aesthetic. One may, then, think of aesthetic value as\none kind of artistic value that, alongside with moral,\nreligious, political, historical and financial value, some artworks\nhave and others do\n not.[8] \n\nNow, even if it is granted that art need not be aesthetic, it is still\npossible to hold that conceptual art does not qualify as good\nart because it does not (aim to) yield aesthetic experiences.  But\nwhile this may be a viable position to hold in relation to the project\nof conceptual art in general, it cannot be used to attack conceptual\nart on its own grounds. Saying, for example, of Michael Craig-Martin’s\nAn Oak Tree that one cannot consider it a great work of art\nbecause it fails to give rise to a distinctively aesthetic kind of\npleasure does not actually undermine the project. Conceptual art, as\nwe now know, is more about conveying meaning through a vehicular\nmedium than about furnishing its audiences with experiences of, say,\nbeauty. Any attack on this fundamental feature of conceptual art\ntargets not so much an individual work of art but rather finds fault\nwith the artistic tradition itself.  At the most basic level of inquiry, two queries arise about\ninterpretation in art: (i) what ‘tools’ do we use to\ninterpret artworks?, and (ii) what is it we do when we interpret\nartworks? In the case of conceptual art, a satisfactory answer to (i)\nwill most probably appeal to elements such as the narrative aids\nprovided by artists or curators (e.g. catalogues, titles, exhibited\nexplanations, labels, etc.); the appropriate mode of perception\n(i.e. looking or listening); and what we know about the artwork’s and\nartist’s social, historical, political or artistic context.  Depending\non the ontological status of the particular piece (if it is, say, a\nready-made or a performance), these elements can be combined in\ndifferent ways to explain our interpretative habits and\npractices.   In addressing (ii) we will most likely need to refer to the\nvarious mental abilities we put to use in such interpretative\nexercises (e.g. imagination, empathy); and also to ask precisely what\nthe target of our interpretation is. This latter task is not as\nunproblematic as it may seem, for it is not always clear whether it is\nthe object itself that should be under scrutiny, the object’s\nperceptual properties (and, if so, which), the idea at the heart of\nthe work, or the artist’s intentions in making the piece. It seems\nunlikely that the question will find an adequate answer until we find\nan acceptable solution to the problem mentioned above, namely\n‘Is the vehicular medium a constitutive part of the conceptual\nartwork or not, and if so how?’.  \n\nTwo further philosophical questions about the notion of artistic\ninterpretation take on a particularly complex dimension in relation to\nconceptual art. First, exactly what information is relevant in\nartistic interpretation? And, more importantly, to what extent should\nthe artist’s intention be allowed to determine the\nappropriate interpretation? Views differ widely on this topic. In\ntheir article, ‘The Intentional Fallacy’, Wimsatt and\nBeardsley famously argue in relation to the literary arts that the\nonly kind of evidence that is relevant to interpretation is that which\nis internal to the work in question.  (Wimsatt & Beardsley\n1946). An artist’s intention or design is of no interpretative\nsignificance. Obviously, this position seems difficult to defend in\nthe case of conceptual art: when we are dealing with pieces such as\nWarhol’s Brillo Boxes, where the internal evidence is clearly\ninsufficient to discern that it is an artwork in the first place, it\nseems that we need to know that Warhol intended the boxes to be viewed\nqua art, at the very least.  \n\nNow, even if we do wish to defend the view that the artist’s intention\nneeds to be taken into account somehow in the interpretation of\nconceptual art, further questions still require our attention\nhere. Most centrally, should the artist’s intention always be\nconsidered the decisive factor in interpretation and\nmust it always be involved? Generally speaking, there are two\nmain strands of intentionalist positions available. On the one hand,\nthere is an approach which holds that the artist’s intention\ndetermines an artwork’s meaning, and thus cannot be overlooked –\nor indeed superseded – in artistic interpretation (e.g., Carroll\n1992).  On the other hand, there is a view that the interpreter ought\nto construct the best hypothesis concerning the artist’s actual\nintention with the help of, say, the text and biographical notes, and\nthat this hypothesis confers meaning on the work in question (e.g.,\nLevinson 1992).\n  \n\nAt least at a first glance, it may seem that conceptual art presents a\nstronger case for the first approach to interpretation, since the\nartist’s intention is all we have to go by, quite literally, in works\nsuch as Robert Barry’s simple statement entitled All the Things I\nKnow But of which I am Not at the Moment Thinking (1969) (see,\ne.g., Maes 2010 and Gover 2012). Nevertheless, the question cannot be\nsettled quite so easily, for many conceptual artists make a point of\nputting all the interpretative onus on the spectator.  How often are\nwe told, after all, that a specific artwork’s meaning rests entirely\nin our hands; that ‘it means whatever you want it to\nmean’?   This leads us to the second question that is especially pertinent\nfor a kind of art that sets out to convey an idea or meaning, namely\nwhether there can be more than one correct or appropriate\ninterpretation of an artwork. Again, several theories present\nthemselves as eligible candidates in relation to this problem. One\nsuggestion has centred around the idea that there can be a\nmultiplicity of appropriate or correct divergent interpretations of\none and the same artwork which cannot be reduced to one underlying\ninterpretation or ranked in relation to each other (e.g., Margolis\n1991; Goldman 1990).  In opposition to this view, however, another\napproach has it that there is in fact always a single best\ninterpretation which is better than any other (e.g., Beardsley 1970).\nThe aim of artistic interpretation is, then, in Matthew Kieran’s\nwords, ‘restricted to discovering the one true meaning of an\nartwork.’ (Kieran 1996, 239). Whilst conceptual art certainly\nseems to rest on something like the interpretative plurality of the\nfirst view, it is not obvious how a kind of art that presents itself\nas an idea can, in reality, accommodate such indeterminacy. \n\nThere are good reasons to believe that of all the questions conceptual\nart gives rise to, interpretation is the most problematic from an\ninternal point of view. The conundrum can be put in the following\nterms. If the conceptual work is the idea, it seems reasonable to\nassume that artistic interpretation will consist primarily in coming\nto understand that idea (which is conceded by the artist to the\nartwork considered as such). In other words, if we take conceptual\nart’s de-materialisation claim seriously, we are left with a notion of\ninterpretation which is relatively constrained to the artist’s\nintention and to the claim that that intention determines the\nappropriate or correct interpretation for that particular work.  \n\nAs we have seen, though, we are often encouraged by conceptual artists to\ntake the interpretative exercise into our own hands, so to speak, and\nnot be shy to use features about ourselves and our own lives as\ninterpretive tools. We are, in other words, asked to combine the\nidea of art as idea with the claim that we can, as spectators, convey\nan entirely new and fresh interpretation onto an artwork that is\nnothing but an idea which, by definition, needs to be about or\nconcerned with something. So, if the idea is the art, then how\ncan my idiosyncratic interpretation of that idea be anywhere near\nvalid? It seems, then that in order to be coherent, conceptual\nart must give up either the claim that the actual artwork is nothing\nother than the idea, or the claim that the interpretative onus lies on\nthe viewer. \n\nIn seeking to convey a semantic representation through a vehicular\nmedium, conceptual art arguably aims to have cognitive – rather\nthan aesthetic – value. By cognitive value, what is meant\nis simply the value an artwork may have in virtue of enhancing or\nincreasing our understanding of some topic, notion or\nevent. Interestingly, conceptual art seems to assume that the\naesthetic detracts from or divests art of its possible cognitive value\nin such a way as to render the two kinds of value close to\nmutually exclusive (Schellekens 2007). \n\nThe attempt to separate the aesthetic from the cognitive is far from a\nrecent investigative endeavour in philosophical circles. In the\nvery first section of Kant’s Critique of the Power of\nJudgement, a clear-cut distinction is outlined between aesthetic\nand cognitive (or ‘logical’) judgements. However, few\nartistic movements have pressed these questions about the division\nbetween aesthetic value on the one hand, and cognitive value on the\nother, as scrupulously and explicitly as conceptual art. In fact,\nconceptual art makes things very difficult for itself by holding that\nthe only kind of artistic value that is entirely legitimate is\ncognitive value.  \n\nClearly, conceptual art is not the only kind of art that may have\ncognitive value – many other artforms aim to have cognitive\nvalue in addition to aesthetic value – and most of us\nwould agree that part of why we find art rewarding is precisely\nbecause it often yields some kind of understanding. That is to say,\nwe read novels, look at paintings and listen to music not only because\nof the pleasure it may afford, but also because it tends to make us\nricher human beings, better able to make sense of the world around\nus.  \n\nUncontroversial as this claim may seem, some philosophers have denied\nthat art should either have or seek to have cognitive value. Most\nfamously perhaps, expressivists such as Clive Bell and Roger Fry held\nthat art should only seek to express and arouse emotions (Bell\n1914; Fry 1920). More recently, James Young has defended a view\nwhereby avant-garde art, like conceptual art, cannot yield any\nsignificant knowledge or understanding (Young 2001, 77).\n \n\nYoung’s argument focuses on the notion of exemplification which\nhe locates at the heart of the only kind of semantic representation and\ncognitive value that can be ascribed to artworks such as conceptual\nones. Exemplification is a form of reference to properties by\nmeans of a sample (or exemplar). An exemplar ‘stands for\nsome property by [non-metaphorically, literally] possessing the\nproperty’ (Young 2001, 72). In the case of conceptual art,\na work then exemplifies an idea or concept. So, for example, Tom\nMarioni’s The Act of Drinking Beer with One’s Friends\nis the Highest Form of Art\n (1970)[9]\n – a piece involving the artist and his\nfriends drinking beer together – is an exemplar of the idea at\nthe heart of the work, namely that drinking beer with one’s\nfriends is the highest art-form of all. This is the work’s\nstatement. However, as Young points out, it doesn’t follow\nfrom the fact that something expresses a statement or has meaning that\nit has significant cognitive value. In an nutshell, Young’s\nclaim is that all things considered, the kind of statement that\nconceptual artworks and their ilk are really able to make \nare merely truisms. If conceptual art yields cognitive \nvalue, that is to say, it tends to be so\ntrivial that it barely deserves the name.  \n\nThe argument puts a finger on an experience shared by many spectators\nof conceptual art who feel conned or deceived by it. Not only are\nconceptual artworks not beautiful, one might object, they don’t even\ntell us anything over and beyond banal clichés. What,\nthen, is conceptual art really good for?  \n\nIf there is to be a way out of this difficulty, we will have to take\nthe bull by the horns and discuss exactly what (kind of) understanding one\nmay gain from it. This answer will have to be cashed out in terms\nof two concerns: one about the content of the knowledge, and\nanother about the kind of knowledge in question. First,\nknowledge yielded by art can be about the artwork – not only the\ntechniques employed, the work’s history and tradition, and so on,\nbut also the meaning and thoughts that the work conveys. Second,\nart can yield either propositional knowledge or knowledge by\nacquaintance. Whereas the first consists of knowledge given to us\nin terms of propositions and can either be concerned with the artwork\nitself (e.g. knowledge ‘that it represents the Emperor\nMaximilan’s  execution’)  or a reality beyond that work (e.g.\nknowledge ‘that horrible things are often done in the name of\npolitical revolutions’), the second kind of knowledge has the potential to enable one\nto imagine what it would be like to be in a certain position or\nsituation, to empathize, to come very close to experiencing what it\nwould be like to have that kind of experience first-hand (e.g. what it\nis like to witness the execution of a dishonoured Emperor).  \n\nThe notions of knowledge and cognitive value, whilst at the very heart\nof the conceptual project, raise a manifold of important questions that\nrequire solid and cogent philosophical answers. Perhaps\nexemplification can still serve an epistemological purpose by inviting\nus to engage with the issues raised by a work of art in a richer and\nmore imaginative way; in a way that makes us think about questions of\nphilosophical interest in particular way – a way that\npropositions alone cannot do? Perhaps the key to conceptual\nart’s value lies in a more challenging intellectual relationship\nwith the work, a genuine engagement with the idea in question.\nExploring this avenue may yet help us see what kind of non-trivial\ncognitive value conceptual art is capable of yielding. \n\nMany more questions centred around these five philosophical themes\nremain to be examined in relation to conceptual art. With regards\nto concerns about defining art, we need to address the increasing\nnumber of worries to do with exactly how we are to distinguish art from\nnon-art, and indeed whether there really is a distinction (if only\nconceptual) to be drawn here. That is to say, if conceptual art\nis at times not only perceptually indistinguishable from non-art but it\nis also the case that everything is alleged to be (part of) a potential\nartwork, perhaps the inevitable outcome is that there simply cannot be\na principled distinction between art and non-art. So, does the\nconceptual project lead to the end of the category of art as\nsuch?  \n\nFrom the ontological perspective, this set of concerns acquires an\neven more aggressive flavour: if art should be all about putting\nforward ideas and making statements, why, one might wonder, do we need\nthe conceptual artwork at all? Can we not merely ask the same\nquestions and make the same statements directly?  \n\nIn addition to these questions, the host of issues that have been\nraised about interpretation, intention, appreciation and the way they\nare (or should be) related have not yet been silenced. For art\nthat is as discourse-dependent as most conceptual art is, it is not\nalways clear whether there is anything more to interpreting conceptual\nart than just being told what the idea in question is. And if so,\ncan we still call this interpretation?  \n\nFinally, what are we to make of the relation between aesthetic and\ncognitive value in conceptual art – should they be considered as\nin opposition or even as mutually exclusive? If the only kind of\nvalue that is of genuine artistic importance is cognitive value, it will be\ndifficult to avoid the definitional and ontological concerns mentioned\nabove. Also, it will call for a deeply revisionary conception of\nart, one fundamentally hostile to the very notions we are probably most\nused to associating with art, namely beauty and aesthetic pleasure.\n \n\nCentral to the philosophy of conceptual art is thus the provocative\nspirit of the project under investigation – conceptual art throws\ndown the gauntlet by challenging us to reconsider every aspect of\nartistic experience, and it may well be up to philosophy to pick it up\nand address some of the questions conceptual art makes its business to\nraise. Conceptual art actively aims to be thought-provoking,\nstimulating and inspiring, and if only for that reason, philosophers\ninterested in art should not pass it by unaffected.","contact.mail":"Elisabeth.schellekens@filosofi.uu.se","contact.domain":"filosofi.uu.se"}]
