Feminist philosophy of biology deploys feminist\nphilosophical methods to examine the categories of sex and gender (sex\nand gender will be explained below) and its focus can range from\nconsiderations of particular biological knowledge claims to\nconsiderations of foundational concepts and methodologies in biology,\nthe philosophy of biology, and the philosophy of science. In\ndoing so, feminist philosophers of biology often show that the\nphilosophical investigations of a particular science are intertwined\nwith both ethics and politics.\n\n\n\nThis entry is divided into five sections. The introductory\nsection discusses some of the challenges of defining feminist\nphilosophy of biology and highlights areas of commonality with\nnon-feminist philosophy of biology. The second section explores the\nvariety of motivations and epistemic perspectives found within feminist\nphilosophy of biology. The third section considers, in some\ndepth, two central examples of feminist analysis of biological\nresearch: a) sexual selection and b) sociobiology and evolutionary\npsychology of sex and gender. In section four I discuss feminist\nanalyses of some foundational concepts within philosophy of biology and\nphilosophy of science more generally, such as biological determinism\nand reductionism. Many of these foundational concepts are\nconsidered by both feminist and non-feminist philosophers of\nbiology. The entry concludes with a discussion of opportunities\nfor further research in feminist philosophy of biology.\n\n\n\nFeminist philosophy of biology bears much in common with\nnon-feminist philosophy of biology. Non-feminist philosophy of\nbiology is highly interdisciplinary and has unclear disciplinary\nboundaries. Major contributors include scientists as well as\nphilosophers. There are two general and often closely related\napproaches to the practice of philosophy of biology. First, philosophy\nof biology uses philosophical methods to address topics of central\nimportance in the biological sciences, such as natural selection,\nfitness, adaptation, and the nature of genes. Second, philosophy\nof biology addresses central topics in the philosophy of science, such\nas reductionism, laws of nature, and theory change, from the\nperspective of the biological sciences instead of physics as is more\ntraditional in philosophy of science. Philosophy of biology is\noften informed by a naturalistic approach, meaning that the work is\nclosely tied to the actual history and practice of the science in\nquestion. It is not uncommon for philosophers of biology, at\nleast at some point during their careers, to become significantly\ninvolved with the science itself, either in terms of conducting\nbiological research or collaborating with biologists on research or\npedagogical projects. \n\nThe boundaries of feminist philosophy of biology are similarly\nunclear. It is not clear whether the authors cited in this entry would\nprimarily label themselves as philosophers of biology or science\nstudies scholars or scientists. Not surprisingly, the two general\napproaches to philosophy of biology are also advanced in feminist\nphilosophy of biology. First, many feminist philosophers of\nbiology are concerned with biological concepts and knowledge claims\nregarding sex and gender \n(see the entry on feminist perspectives on sex and gender), \nas well as the influence of gender values on\nbiological research. Sex refers to biological differences between males\nand females. Gender refers to the meanings that humans make of these\nbiological differences, and the individual and social aspects of\nmasculinity and femininity. Since it is with our bodies that we\nact, and since psychological and social causes can affect our bodies,\nthere is much debate about the relationships between sex and gender. By\n‘male’ and ‘female’ I am referring to the sex\nof human and non-human organisms and by ‘men’ and\n‘women’ I am referring to the gender of humans. Feminist\nanalysis is often performed as a control (in a sense to be explained\nbelow) to test for the unrecognized influence of gender values on the\nproduction of knowledge, in existing knowledge claims, and in the\nchoices of research projects. These gender values can include\nsexism (devaluation, in practice primarily of women, based on\ntraditional stereotypes of gender roles) and androcentrism (a focus on\nmen or males and the neglect or exclusion of women or females).\nAs I will explain in more detail below, feminist investigations\nof the relationships between gender values, and the practices and\nproducts of the biological sciences, can take place in a range of\nepistemological projects. Some projects focus on removing gender\nbias, and others focus on developing an understanding of the role of\nsocial values, including gender values, in biological research. \n\nSecond, feminist philosophy of biology considers the gendered nature\nof foundational concepts in biology, philosophy of biology and\nphilosophy of science, such as reductionism (see section 4.2),\ndeterminism (see section 4.1) and the nature of objectivity (see the\nentry on feminist epistemology and philosophy of science).\nAs I will discuss below, some feminist philosophers of biology contend\nthat gendered social values are not only intertwined with particular\ntheories or knowledge claims, but can also support and be supported by\nthese foundational concepts (Fehr 2004, Longino 1990). Since\nthese concepts are of central concern in non-feminist philosophy of\nbiology and philosophy of science more generally, there is ample\nopportunity for feminist and non-feminist philosophy of biology to\nbecome more closely related. There is also significant\nfeminist work regarding scientific objectivity that is at least\npartially motivated by the presence and power of unacknowledged\ngendered assumptions, including androcentrism and sexism, in biological\nsciences ranging from genetics and cell biology, to sociobiology (for\nexample Keller 1985, Longino 1990, 2002, Haraway 1989, Harding\n1986). \n\nWork in feminist philosophy of biology can be motivated by a number\nof, often interrelated, goals including countering biological arguments\nsupporting women's oppression, revealing and analyzing the role\nof gender values in the production of biological knowledge, and\nfacilitating the production of maximally accurate accounts of female\nbiology and gendered topics of study in the biological\nsciences. \n\nThe science of biology is of importance to many feminists because\nwomen's biology has been used to rationalize women's oppression. There\nis a wide range of biological arguments supporting the oppression of\nwomen. Take for example Edward H.  Clarke's nineteenth century\nargument that intensive study would physically harm women by diverting\nenergy from their uterus to their brain. He claimed that higher\neducation would result in women with “monstrous brains and puny\nbodies … [and] abnormally weak digestion” (Clarke 1874,\n41). This argument regarding women's inferiority has been a focus of\nfeminist philosophy of biology (see for example Hubbard\n1990). Similarly, evolutionary arguments that can provide foundational\nsupport for sexist or oppressive practices, for example, arguments for\nthe adaptive nature of violence against women (see Palmer and\nThornhill (2000) for a readable account of this research program),\nhave drawn intensive feminist scrutiny (for example see papers in\nTravis 2003a). Harvard past-president Lawrence Summers was not the\nfirst or only person to use biological arguments about the different\ndistributions of intelligence among men and women to justify the\nabsence of women from positions of social power and from higher\npowered careers (Wilson 1978, Summers 2005—see the Other\nInternet Resources). Here also, there is a significant feminist\nresponse (Bleier 1984, Fausto-Sterling 1992, Fehr 2008). \n\nFeminists have pointed out that much of the political power of these\nsorts of biological arguments arises from problematic assumptions of\ndeterminism (see section 4.1), or in other words, assumptions of a\nclose connection between women's biology, in terms of genes,\nhormones, and physiology, and women's psychological attributes\nand social positions. The general notion is that\nbiology, as opposed to culture, is static and fixed. As a result\nsome contend that any political activity designed to change or improve\nwomen's condition is trying to create an ‘unnatural’\nsystem that is doomed to fail. This position, while common\nin nineteenth and early twentieth century biology, can still be found\nin the work of some contemporary biologists, including some early and\ninfluential work in sociobiology (Wilson 1978). As a result\nfeminists have been strongly motivated to analyze particular claims\nabout female biology, to interrogate the assumption that genetic or\nbiological nature implies fixity, and to reveal the wide range of\ninteracting biological and social causes of women's phenotypes,\nincluding their psychological attributes and social positions. In\nsection four I will discuss biological determinism in more detail. \n\nFeminist philosophy of biology is also driven by epistemic\nmotivations. For example, feminists such as Ruth Bleier (1984)\nand Anne Fausto-Sterling (1985/1992) reveal that sexist and\nandrocentric biases can be found in the biological knowledge produced\naccording to biological science's contemporary best practices or\naccepted epistemic standards. This can drive more general\nquestions about the role that values in general, and gender values in\nparticular, play in the production of scientific or biological\nknowledge (Longino 1990, 2002; Richardson 2008). \n\nFinally, much feminist philosophy of biology is also very concerned\nwith getting the biology right. Many feminist philosophers of\nbiology were initially trained as scientists and are interested not\njust in critiquing, but also in improving the practice of science as it\nrelates to sex and gender. Along similar lines, feminist\nphilosophers have also documented the impact of feminism on improving\nthe practices of the biological sciences themselves. For example,\nDonna Haraway's book Primate Visions (1989) documents\nthe influence that the incorporation of feminist women in primatology\nhad on the study of primate behavior and animal behavior more\ngenerally. Haraway shows that feminist primatologist Jeanne\nAltmann, instigated a quiet but powerful methodological revolution. In\none of the most cited papers in the study of animal behavior,\n“Observational study of behavior: Sampling methods” (1974),\nAltmann evaluated a range of sampling methods and in doing so developed\na method, focal-animal sampling, that undermined previous research\ngenerating sexist accounts of leadership and control, and enabled\nresearch on female primates and on novel topics such as mothering.\nAltmann, troubled by the androcentric focus in primatology and\nless than rigorous methodologies, brought her perspectives as a woman,\na feminist, a mother, and a mathematically trained scientist to bear on\nimproving research methods. Focal animal sampling provides an\neffective method for studying the social behavior of female primates\nand has become an important approach in animal behavior research in\ngeneral. Haraway's description of Altmann's\ncontributions to primatology and animal behavior provides an example of\nthe positive impact of feminism and feminist scientists on the\npractices and products of scientific research. \n\nMotivations to conduct research in feminist philosophy of biology\ninclude the drive to challenge biological justifications for\nwomen's oppression, interrogate the epistemic function of gender\nvalues in scientific practice, and improve the practices and products\nof biological research on sex and gender. \n\nGetting the biology ‘right’ can mean different things\nand there is a range of epistemological positions or objectives held by\nfeminist philosophers of biology. These objectives include (1)\nrevealing gender bias in biological accounts of sex and gender, (2)\nanalyzing science as a social, value-laden practice and (3) exploring\nhow the social and material situation of biologists affects knowledge\nproduction. \n\nBias. The largest body of work in feminist philosophy of\nbiology concerns revealing and eliminating sexist and androcentric\nbias. Central and early work in the field documented the presence of\nassumptions of female passivity and male activity in a wide range of\nbiological accounts of sex and gender. Examples include critique of\nresearch on sex determination (Birke 1986, Bleier 1984), fertilization\n(Martin 1991), human evolution (Bleier 1984, Fausto-Sterling\n1985/1992, Hubbard 1990) and the discipline of primatology (Hrdy 1986,\n1997, and Haraway 1989). More recently, Elisabeth Lloyd (1993, 2005)\nhas studied biological explanations of women's orgasm. She\ndemonstrates that these accounts often rely on two false assumptions,\nassumptions that involve (1) presupposing that these explanations need to\nbe based on natural selection and (2) presupposing a tight link\nbetween women's sexuality and reproduction. Feminist research on\nsexist bias in biology focuses on eliminating myths of female biology\nthat are colored by contemporary social values and facilitating the\nproduction of biological research that more accurately reveals the\nfacts about sex and gender. In this sense a feminist perspective is\nseen as a sort of control, with the goal of removing gender bias,\ni.e., sexist and androcentric social values, from scientific\nresearch. For example, The Biology and Gender Study Group (1988,\n61–62) write that, \nWe have come to look at feminist critique as we would any other\nexperimental control. Whenever one performs an experiment, one\nsets up all the controls one can think of in order to make as certain\nas possible that the result obtained does not come from any other\nsource. One asks oneself what assumptions one is making. Have I\nassumed the temperature to be constant? Have I assumed that the pH\ndoesn't change over the time of the reaction? Feminist critique\nasks if there may be some assumptions that we haven't checked\nconcerning gender bias. In this way feminist critique should be\npart of normative science. Like any control, it seeks to provide\ncritical rigor, and to ignore this critique is to ignore a possible\nsource of error. \n\nThe Biology and Gender Study Group (BGSG) point out that old models\nof sex determination simply assumed that female developmental patterns\nwere neutral and passive, while male developmental patterns required\nsome sort of active switch to initiate their development (1988).\nThe BGSG refer with approval to the 1980's work of Eva Eicher and\nLinda Washburn, who created a developmental model that did not make the\nsexist assumption of female passivity and was based on genetic\nevidence. In this model both male and female development had\npassive and active components. Further, Eicher and Washburn demonstrate\nthat although there had been significant research on testes\ndetermination, there had been practically no work on ovary\ndetermination. As a result of this androcentrism, claims about\nthe passivity of female sexual development were made in the absence of\nevidence. The BGSG sees Eicher and Washburn as an example of a\nfeminist-influenced critique of cell and molecular biology because they\ncontrolled for gender bias. This allowed them to be “open to\ndifferent interpretations of one's data” and gave them\n“the ability to ask questions that would not have occurred within\nthe traditional context” (68). \n\nA focus on bias is only one of several epistemic approaches within\nfeminist philosophy of biology. Sarah Richardson (2010), while\npointing out the value of case studies of gender bias, is critical of\ntendencies to focus solely on revealing and removing bias. She\npoints out that there is institutional pressure to work on bias:\n“within philosophy of science as a whole, the most central and\nwidely-accepted philosophical question related to gender in science is\nthe issue of gender bias in science.” Richardson argues that\nbecause it is customary in the philosophy of science to see good\nscience as value neutral, analyses of bias fall clearly within a\ntraditional philosophical approach. However, even in the face of\nthese professional incentives, she argues that a primary or sole focus\non bias is a limiting epistemic position. It is limited because\nit fails to take into account feminist work, in epistemology and\nphilosophy of science, that considers how values, including\ngender values, not only limit but also facilitate knowledge\nproduction. Such an account complicates the traditional view that\nvalues should be identified solely in order to guard against their\nimpact and leads to a second epistemic perspective, analyses of science\nas a social value-laden practice. \n\nScience as a social value-laden practice. Helen\nLongino has developed an influential social account of scientific\nknowledge production, critical contextual empiricism (1990,\n2002). Her development of this view is informed by her early work\nwith Ruth Doell (1983) on a case study of biological models of the role\nof hormones in the development of sexual behavior. Longino points out\nthat there is an inferential gap between a theory and the evidence\nresearchers use to assess that theory. Longino argues that researchers\nclose the gap between evidence and theories with background assumptions\nof which they may not be aware. Background assumptions include\nboth epistemic and contextual values, and contextual values can include\ngendered social values. She argues that scientific communities maximize\nobjectivity and justification when they (1) include members who differ\nfrom one another in terms of the background assumptions they hold and\n(2) take dissenting views seriously. Critical discourse among\nthose who hold assumptions that differ from one another improves\njustification or objectivity because it can facilitate researchers\nbecoming aware of and critically evaluating the background assumptions\n(including those that are sexist and androcentric) that inform their\nresearch practices. Communities can then decide whether or not\nthose assumptions are acceptable given their research goals. Using\nexamples including sex differences in human evolution, behavioral\nendocrinology and neurobiology, Longino demonstrates that gendered\nassumptions structure a range of research programs in biology.\nShe writes “The long standing devaluation of women's voices\nand those of members of racial minorities means that such [racist and\nsexist] assumptions have been protected from critical scrutiny”\n(1990, 78–79). The implication is that these racist and sexist\nassumptions, had they received critical scrutiny, would have been\ndeemed unacceptable. \n\nSituated knowledge. Donna Haraway coined the term\n‘situated knowledge’, this view has become very influential\nin academic feminism, including feminist epistemology. In her\nbook Primate Visions (1989) she explores the ways that\nprimatology constructs political narratives about the categories of\nnature, gender, and race, and the ways that those categories are\nintegrated with particular perspectives situated in social and material\nlocations. She also reveals the ways that feminist primatologists\nhave turned primatology into what some call a feminist science. \n\nIn Haraway's account of situated knowledge, the knowing\nsubject, including the biologist, is embodied, meaning that one has a\nparticular material and social location (for example one's\nlocation can include being a woman, feminist, scientist, Anglo\nAmerican, heterosexual,…). As a result Haraway argues that\nit is illusory to think that there is an impartial view from\nnowhere. Because of particularities of material and social\nlocation, the perspective(s) from which we know and the knowledge we\nproduce are partial. According to Haraway, objectivity involves\nnot only describing the world as faithfully as one can, but also\nacknowledging the particularities of one's perspective and being\nresponsible for the partial perspective (chosen from the multitude of\nfeatures of our location) that we employ. Haraway argues\nthat there is a multitude of ways for dividing the world into objects\nand categories. One's perspective does not just influence\none's interests, the questions one asks and the methods, theories\nand strategies that one uses to answer those questions; it also\ninfluences one's ontology, in terms of the objects and kinds of\nthings that one investigates. The job of achieving objectivity then\nbecomes one of negotiating or translating what we know across different\nsubject locations, which can include different political, epistemic and\nontological commitments. \n\nHaraway's account of feminist primatologists shows not only\nthat a partial (as opposed to impartial) feminist perspective was\nproductive in terms of asking new questions, of illuminating new\nobjects and categories of objects, and developing new theories.\nIt also shows that what, at the time, were more mainstream perspectives\nwere, as all viewpoints, also partial. If those more mainstream\nviews seemed impartial, it was because those who held them had long\npossessed institutional and social power such that they did not need to\nconsider the alternatives and because the discipline had previously\nexcluded many who held different partial perspectives. \n\nWe can see situated knowledge in Jeanne Altmann's working from\nthe perspective of a woman, a mother, and a feminist to develop\nmethodologies that allowed for the systematic study of the often\nlow-drama interactions among female primates and between mothers and\ntheir offspring, which were previously not salient to\nresearchers. Another example from Primate Visions (1989)\nis Adrienne Zihlman's critique of associations of sexual\ndimorphism with, usually male, dominance. Zihlman, who is best known\nfor her development, with Nancy Tanner, of Woman the Gatherer theory of\nearly human evolution, consciously developed a feminist stance toward\ngender and science. Zihlman argued that sexual dimorphism was not\na unitary phenomenon. Different species can be sexually dimorphic\nnot only to different degrees, but in different ways, including bone\nlength and structure, tendencies to build muscle or fat tissue, and/or\ncanine size. These different kinds of sexual dimorphism can be\nrelated to differences in aggressive capacities and differences in\nforaging strategies, both of which had been associated with\nevolutionary accounts of gender differences. Zihlman's\nstance as a feminist scientist allowed her to focus on heterogeneity\nand complexity, which made generalizations about sexual dimorphism\nhighly problematic and undermined associations of general sexual\ndimorphism with male dominance. \n\nAs discussed in this section, epistemic perspectives in feminist\nphilosophy of biology range across work on gender bias, considerations\nof biology a social and value-laden practice, and Haraway's\ndevelopment and use of the idea of situated knowledge. \n\nThis section focuses on two areas of biological research that have\nreceived extensive feminist analysis, sexual selection theory, and\nsociobiology and evolutionary psychology. \n\nFeminist interventions regarding evolutionary models of sexual\nselection are important for at least two reasons. First, the role\nof female organisms in evolution was generally neglected or\nmisrepresented by biologists until the later part of the\n20th century. Second, these models provide theoretical\nfoundations for many biological accounts of human nature that support\nsexist and androcentric stereotypes, in particular accounts that\nportray women as passive and coy, and men as active and\npromiscuous. \n\nEvolution by natural selection happens when there are heritable\ndifferences among types of organisms in a population and, as a result\nof these differences, some types leave more offspring than\nothers. This leads to changes in the frequencies of those\ndifferent types of organisms in a population. Darwin described\nsexual selection in terms of “the advantage which certain\nindividuals have over other individuals of the same sex and species, in\nexclusive relation to reproduction (1871, vol. 1 256). In other\nwords, this advantage need not be one of physiological or mechanical\nefficiency or longevity, but rather concerns increasing reproductive\npotential. Darwin notes two kinds of sexual selection: male-male\ncompetition and female choice. This twofold characterization of\nsexual selection remains standard in current biological literature\nranging from academic publications to textbooks to the popular\npress. Darwin writes that “the male is generally eager to\npair with any female” whereas females tend to choose the most\nattractive partner (1859, 70; 1871, 582). Darwin considered the\ncompetition among males “for the possession of the other\nsex” to result in the improvement of sensory and locomotory\nfeatures and the development of strong passions. \n\nThis theme is carried through in his discussion in Sexual\nSelection in Relation to Man, in which hunting, defense of self\nand community, and competition for mates result in the development of\nmen's “observation, reason, invention and\nimagination.” Women obtain these traits because they inherit them\nfrom their fathers. Darwin writes that “It is, indeed, fortunate\nthat the law of the equal transmission of characters to both sexes\nprevails with mammals; otherwise it is probable that man would have\nbecome as superior in mental endowment to women, as the peacock is in\nornamental plumage to the peahen” (Darwin, 1871, 565). Whereas\nDarwin believed that male-male competition was generally thought to\nimprove the species, female choice resulted in the development of\nbeauty without utility: “a great number of male animals…\nhave been rendered beautiful for beauty's sake” (Darwin\n1859, 371); “the most refined beauty may serve as a charm for the\nfemale, and for no other purpose” (1871, vol. 2 92). In this\nview, the expensive and dangerous displays of the peacock are the\nresult of the preference of females for males with the most beautiful\ndisplay. It is worth noting that Darwin developed his notions of\nfemale choice to account for traits that seemed to be maladaptive from\nthe perspective of natural selection alone. \n\nSeveral feminist scholars, most especially Ruth Hubbard (1990), have\nclearly pointed out the close parallels of Darwin's account of\neager males competing with one another for access to reticent and\nchoosy females with Victorian gender values (see also, Fausto-Sterling\n1985/1992). It is also noted that the activity of choice Darwin\nascribed to females is caused by a female preoccupation with beauty and\nas such often has negative consequences for both male survival and the\nspecies itself. Nonetheless, feminists have revealed that Darwin\nwas exceptional for theorizing that female choice had any evolutionary\nconsequences at all. For example, as Helena Cronin (1991) points\nout, Darwin's contemporaries, especially Alfred Russell Wallace,\n(1) were skeptical that females had an aesthetic sense, (2) believed\nthat if they did have one, it was unlikely to be stable enough to\nresult in evolutionary change, (3) believed that female choice, if it\ndid exist, would be swamped out by natural selection, and finally (4)\nbelieved that the excessive male displays were likely the result of the\nexcess vigor possessed by male animals and not female choice.\nDarwin's theories of sexual selection and especially of female\nchoice languished for nearly a century. \n\nContemporary thought regarding sexual selection is heavily\ninfluenced by the work of biologists Angus Bateman and Robert\nTrivers. Bateman (1948) hypothesized that variance in\nreproductive success would be greater among males than among females.\nFemale reproduction is limited by the number of eggs a female produces\nand during a single reproductive cycle a female uses the sperm from one\nor a small number of copulations. According to Bateman's view,\nonce the female has garnered the sperm needed to fertilize her eggs,\nshe does not benefit from further mating. As a result a female ought to\nbe picky about who she mates with and since, according to the theory,\nsperm is never in short supply, all females are assumed to produce\nabout the same number of offspring. Male reproduction, on the other\nhand, is limited by the number of females that a male can\ninseminate. A male gains benefits from inseminating as many\nfemales as possible. This results in competition among males for access\nto females, with some males mating with many females and some males\nmating with few or no females. Bateman conducted an experiment\nwith fruit flies in which he found higher variance in male reproductive\nsuccess than female reproductive success. \n\nTrivers (1972) added considerations of parental care to\nBateman's argument. Trivers argues that females generally\ninvest more than males in reproduction, not only in terms of creating\nlarge eggs, but also in the development and care of offspring. As\na result, females ought to be even choosier regarding mates and become\nan even more limited resource for males. Again, it follows that males\nare motivated to mate with as many females as possible and females are\nmotivated to resist male advances in the hope of choosing the best mate\npossible. This is correlated with and reinforces stereotypes of\nmales as active, promiscuous, and competitive, and females as passive,\ncoy, and nurturing. The rhetoric of the coy female and the promiscuous\nmale is decreasing but is still common among many accounts of sexual\nselection. \n\nFeminist philosophers of biology are deeply concerned about the\nwholesale application of this model of sexual selection without\nempirically testing its underlying assumptions and investigating the\nrelationship between the underlying foundations of the model and\ncultural assumptions regarding gender. Whether or not it is\nintended to do so by researchers in the field, this model can offer\nsupport to current gender inequities. As Hubbard (1990, 110) points\nout, “from the seemingly innocent asymmetries between eggs and\nsperm flow such major social consequences as female fidelity, male\npromiscuity, women's disproportional contribution to the care of\nchildren, and the unequal distribution of labour by sex.” This\nmodel also provides a basis for arguments that rape is an evolved\nreproductive strategy among human males (Thornhill and Palmer\n2000). And E. O. Wilson (1978, 103) proposes that because of\narguments based on this model “even with identical education for\nmen and women and equal access to all professions, men are likely to\nmaintain disproportionate representation in political life, business,\nand science.” \n\nThe traditional theoretical perspective on sexual selection\ndescribed above is an elegant model. However, it relies on several\nassumptions in order to be applicable to actual cases. Hrdy\n(1986) has described three broad categories of assumptions needed to\nsuccessfully apply this model to real situations. The first\nassumption is that male investment in the production of offspring\nis small relative to female investment. Ruth Hubbard\n(1990) points out that the challenge here is determining the\nappropriate way to characterize and measure investment. Eggs are\nlarger than sperm. So, if one simply considers gamete size, male\ninvestment is smaller. However, males do not use a microscopic\neyedropper to dispense one sperm at a time. Hubbard questions\nwhether investment ought to be measured at the level of the individual\ngamete. When one includes the total amount of energy and resources that\nare need to produce sperm and semen, the energy required to develop and\nmaintain secondary sexual characteristics (differences between the\nsexes that are not directly linked to the reproductive system), the\ncosts of male-male competition, the costs that males of many species\ninvest in defending a territory, and the effort that the males of some\nspecies put into parental care, male costs may turn out to be higher\nthan researchers have historically expected. These male costs may\nbe further increased if one measures them over an individual's\nlifetime as opposed to a single reproductive event. It is\nimportant for researchers to justify their characterization of what\ncounts as investment. \n\nThe second assumption is that there is greater variance in male\nthan female reproductive success. While this is the case for\nmany species, (for example, Bateman's fruit flies), it is an\nempirical matter whether or not this applies to other species. In\nsome species, variance in female reproductive success is higher than\nhas been assumed and in some species, variance in male reproductive\nsuccess is lower than is often assumed. Hrdy (1981/1999, 1986)\npoints out that there has been a lack of attention to ways that a\nfemale can end investment in a particular reproductive attempt, for\nexample, female birds abandoning nests or spontaneous abortion among\nsome species of mammals. Attention also needs to be paid to the\neffects of a female's physiological condition and social status\non her reproductive output. Hrdy demonstrates that female\nprimates have an impressive array of active strategies that they employ\nto control their own reproduction. For example, competition and\nsystems of social alliances among female primates can lead to\nunexpected variance in female reproductive success. Hubbard\n(1990) allows that theoretically there could be greater variance in\nreproductive success among men than among women, but claims that\ngenerally most societies have the same number of men and women\nproducing children and do not operate using a few\n“super-studs.” Hubbard points out that it remains to\nbe demonstrated that weaker men, however one would measure this\ncharacteristic, have fewer children than powerful men and that women\ntend to have similar numbers of children. \n\nThe final assumption is that the only evolutionary benefit of\nsex for females is fertilization. As Sterelny and Griffiths\n(1999) report, the power of the model decreases as the gap between sex\nand reproduction increases. Hrdy (1986), focusing on primatology,\npoints out that once the notion of female promiscuity and the idea that\nthere can be more reasons for mating than simply gathering sperm from\none high quality male, were considered, several new hypotheses\nregarding the benefits of female promiscuity emerged. Some of\nthese hypotheses are still linked to reproduction, although the picture\nis more complicated than issues of female choice and male\ncompetition. For example, the diverse paternity hypothesis\npredicts that in unpredictable and changing environments a\nfemale's lifetime reproductive success can be improved by\nproducing offspring with different fathers. Other hypotheses are\nnot directly related to reproduction. Examples include the\nhypothesis that multiple matings and orgasms are physiologically\nbeneficial to females and the hypothesis that females have sex with\nsubordinate males to stop these males from leaving the social\ngroup. Hrdy writes that “all but one of these\nhypotheses…were arrived at by considering the world from a\nfemale's point of view” (127). She points\nout that when this change in perspective was happening, primarily in\nthe 1970's, there was an increase in the proportion of women\nprimatologists and that these women were paying attention to female\nprimates. She doubts that it is just chance that led women\nscientists to look at female behaviors, writing in 1986 that “it\nis disconcerting to note that primatologists are beginning to find\npolitically motivated females and nurturing males at roughly the same\ntime that a woman runs for vice president of the United States and Garry\nTrudeau starts to poke fun at ‘caring males’ in his\ncartoons (137).” \n\nMore recent research on sexual selection has embraced a wider range\nof perspectives. In particular there is a growing body of\nfeminist research on topics such as male mate choice, female-female\ncompetition, and the active female role in evolutionary reproductive\nconflicts between the sexes (see Hrdy 1999 and Gowaty 1992, 1997,\n2004). Joan Roughgarden offers an alternative to sexual\nselection, social selection theory, that focuses on the direct\necological benefits of social behavior, including animal mating\nbehavior (2004, 2009). These ecological benefits refer to the\nways that social interactions can improve the number of offspring that\nan individual can raise. This theory can account for the\nempirical evidence that has been used to support sexual\nselection. It does not treat same sex sexuality as anomalous\nbecause these social interactions can provide ecological benefits that\nsupport reproductive success. This theory is the subject of\nlively debate. Sexual selection theory is an active field of research,\nin which there is lots of opportunity for further feminist\nanalyses. \n\nBroadly speaking, sociobiology, which arises out of work in\npopulation genetics, population ecology and ethology, is the\nevolutionary study of human and non-human social behavior.\nSociobiologists postulate that some behaviors are traits, just like\nheight or hair color, that are subject to evolution by natural\nselection. Ideally, to show that a behavior is an evolutionary\nadaptation, researchers must demonstrate that (1) the behavior is\nheritable, (2) there is or was behavioral variability among individuals\nin a population, and (3) that differential reproduction, caused by the\npresence of the behavior in question, led to an increase in the\nfrequency of individuals tending to exhibit that behavior in a\npopulation. Since researchers cannot go back in time to directly\nobserve the evolution of current behaviors, they most often rely on\nindirect evidence. Sociobiology is most often associated with E.O.\nWilson, either his more general work exemplified in his book\nSociobiology a New Synthesis (1975) or On Human\nNature (1978), which focuses on human sociobiology. There is\nfeminist work in sociobiology such as Sarah Hrdy's work on\nmother-infant relations (1981/1999, 1986). \n\nEvolutionary psychology is sometimes described as\npsychology that is informed by evolutionary theory and sometimes\ndescribed as the latest version of sociobiology. Evolutionary\npsychology differs from sociobiology in several respects. Instead\nof looking for adaptive explanations for particular behaviors,\nevolutionary psychologists develop adaptive hypotheses for\npsychological mechanisms that generate behaviors and tend to assume a\nmodular theory of mind. Whereas there is incredible diversity of\nhuman behavior, many evolutionary psychologists postulate a smaller\nnumber of mechanisms or modules that are responsible for a range of\nbehaviors. Much work in evolutionary psychology relies on\nevolutionary theoretical foundations and psychological empirical\nmethods. Major themes in evolutionary psychological research\ninclude studies of social exchange (Cosmides 1989, Cosmides and Tooby\n1992, Tooby and Cosmides (1992), family dynamics and conflict\n(including violence against stepchildren (Daly and Wilson 2005) and\nwives (Wilson and Daly 1998)), and human mate choice and sexual\njealousy (Buss 2003, 2005). \n\nSociobiology and evolutionary psychology are prominent in popular\nbooks (ex. Wilson 1978, Buss 1994/2003, 2005) and can be found in\npopular media ranging from Business Week (Dotinga 2010) to\nWebMD (Denoon—see the Other Internet Resources). There are two\nmajor feminist concerns with much sociobiological and evolutionary\npsychological research on sex and gender. First the research presents\na picture of human nature that exhibits androcentric, sexist, and\ncapitalist social values. Feminist philosophers of biology have been\nmotivated to carefully analyze this research and have found\nsignificant methodological problems. They have found several areas in\nwhich implicit and unacknowledged social values have influenced this\nresearch and have confounded our understanding of gender and\nbehavior. For example, Thornhill and Palmer in their book, A\nNatural History of Rape (2000), argue that rape is either a\nby-product of male adaptations to desire multiple sexual partners, or\nan evolutionary adaptation itself. In the adaptation view, rape is a\nfacultative reproductive strategy, meaning that rape is the result of\nnatural selection favoring men who commit rape when its evolutionary\nbenefits in terms of producing offspring outweigh its evolutionary\ncosts (such as decreases in the number of offspring produced because\nof injury or punishment). \n\nThere is a significant feminist response to this research (see\nespecially Travis 2003 edited volume). For example,\nElisabeth Lloyd (2003) reveals gaps and unjustified assumptions in\nThornhill and Palmer's evolutionary arguments. She points\nout that Thornhill and Palmer's view is problematically\nadaptationist, meaning that it exhibits an unjustified commitment to\nnatural selection over other kinds of explanation (see Gould and\nLewontin 1979 for the main explanation of, and argument against,\nadaptationism (see the entry on adaptationism), Further,\nLloyd shows that they fail to demonstrate that the behavior in question\nis heritable or that it is the product of natural selection.\nFinally, Lloyd points out that Thornhill and Palmer make the\nunjustified assumption that rape is a unitary phenomenon in the face of\nthe “striking disunity among the various acts that are classed as\nrape” (240). \n\nEmily Martin (2003) also points out that Thornhill and Palmer make\nproblematic assumptions in their definition of ‘rape’. She\nargues that they falsely assume that rape is a static trait not only\nacross cultures, but across species, that they fail to see that\ncharacterizing a behavior as rape requires a culturally specific notion\nof consent and that cultural meanings of rape have changed over\ntime. (See the entry on \nfeminist perspectives on rape for\na more detailed discussion of issues of consent. There remains an\nopportunity for feminist philosophy of biology concerning rape to be\nfurther integrated with feminist literature concerning rape.) Martin\npoints out a second category of assumptions in Thornhill and\nPalmer's work regarding individualism, competition, and\naggression, arising out of evolutionary theory itself. She points\nout the influence of Malthus' work on overpopulation and scarcity\nof resources and of Adam Smith's economics on Darwin's\nformulation of natural selection. She argues that evolutionary\nexplanations tend to be based on notions of individual competition\nunder conditions of scarcity, which are historically and culturally\nspecific and need not hold. She writes, “As Thornhill and\nPalmer, as well as most who espouse the tenets of sociobiology, see the\nworld, it is make up of highly individualized agents bent on maximizing\ntheir own advantage, defined as increasing their genetic stake in the\nnext generation. Any means to that end, however ruthless, violent\nor aggressive, will be looked for and justified as necessary to\nincreasing fitness, so defined” (375). \n\nA second category of feminist concern regarding much research in\nsociobiology and evolutionary psychology involves problematic\nassumptions of a coarse causal connection between genes and\nbehavior. These assumptions, coupled with the assertion that\nhuman behaviors are the result of natural selection, makes it seem as\nthough, as Ruth Bleier (1984, 15) puts it, “we had best resign\nourselves to the more unsavory aspects of human behavior.”\nThe worry is that these studies of the evolution of human behavior\ncast behaviors such as violence against women, wives, and children,\nand the sexual division of labor as biologically determined, hence\nmaking attempts at social change seem futile. \n\nFor example, sociobiologist, David Barash writes, “There is\ngood reason to believe that we are (genetically) primed to be much less\nsexually egalitarian than we appear to be” (1979, 47) and\n“Because men maximize their fitness differently from women, it is\nperfectly good biology that business and professions taste sweeter to\nthem, while home and child care taste sweeter to women” (1979,\n114). When it comes to sex, sociobiologist E.O. Wilson writes,\n“It pays for males to be aggressive, hasty, fickle and\nundiscriminating. In theory it is more profitable for females to\nbe coy, to hold back until they can identify males with the best\ngenes… Human beings obey this biological principle\nfaithfully” (1978, 125). \n\nEvolutionary psychologists tend to argue that the mechanisms that\nproduce behaviors (modules), rather than the behaviors themselves, are\nadaptations. This allows them to introduce flexibility in the\nexpression of behaviors, because some of these mechanisms may be\ntriggered by specific environmental conditions that might not be\npresent. In the example of the evolution of rape discussed above,\nthe argument is not that all men rape, but rather that rape is adaptive\nin environments where its evolutionary benefits outweigh the\ncosts. However, note that the claim is still that rape is a\nuniversal, cross-cultural adaptation, a mechanism ready and waiting to\nbe triggered by the right environmental conditions. \n\nFeminist and non-feminist philosophers of biology have identified a\nrange of problems common among much research in sociobiology and\nevolutionary psychology. (The list below is primarily drawn from\nBleier 1984; see also Anne Fausto-Sterling 1997a, b, 2000; Kitcher 1985\nand Sterelny and Griffiths 1999 offer a good overview and introduction\nto the non-feminist literature.) These problems include kinds of bias\nas well as methodological challenges. \n\nAndrocentrism. Historically female primates were\nstudied only in their interactions with males or with infants.\nWomen primatologists (see Haraway 1989) and sociobiologists (Hrdy 1986)\nwho carefully observed females, as well as other members of primate\ngroups, discovered new information that overthrew previously held\nbeliefs regarding dominance hierarchies, mate selection, and\nfemale-female competition by focusing on female-female\ninteractions. \n\nEthnocentrism. Much research on human behavior focuses on\nidentifying and explaining behavioral traits that are universal among\nhumans and have a cross-cultural meaning. For example, Buss\nargues that love is cross-cultural (1994/2003) and Wilson and Daly that\nmarriage is cross-cultural (1992). However, human beings live in a wide\nvariety of cultural and environmental contexts. John Dupré\nwrites \nAnthropologists describe systems of marriage that are monogamous,\npolygamous, occasionally polyandrous, hypergamous or hypogamous (women\nmarrying up or down although equal status is said to be the commonest\ncase), between people of the same sex, and is some cases as not\ninvolving sexual relations at all (2001, 59).\n \n\nThis makes it difficult to imagine what the cross-cultural universal\ncould be. It also makes it very easy to make false assumptions\nabout the nature of such a phenomenon based on a particular cultural\nperspective. \n\nAnthropocentrism. There is room for unrecognized or\nimplicit social values to enter into research when researchers make\ncomparisons among species. It is easy to create circular\narguments when researchers use loaded terms, defined in the context of\nparticular human language and culture, to describe animal behavior and\nthen use those descriptions to argue that human behaviors are innate\nbecause they are found in animals. For example, it is common to\nrefer to ‘harems’ and ‘prostitution’ when\ndescribing the behavior of non-human primates. There is an\nextensive literature on the evolution of rape, with rape being\n‘observed’ in flowers, scorpion flies, some species of fish\nand ducks, and then these observations are used to draw conclusions\nabout the biological nature of rape in humans. An obvious problem\nis that rape in humans is defined as sex in the absence of consent or\nthat is against the victim's will. The same notion of\nconsent or will in flowers, flies, fish, and ducks is absent. \n\nLack of attention to limitations inherent in studying\nhumans. Human behavior is a fraught area of study. On one\nhand it is seductive because there is a deep interest in trying to\nunderstand why we behave as we do. One the other hand, if\nresearchers are trying to understand social behavior in general, there\nis little to recommend human beings as experimental subjects.\nFirst, it is unethical to perform the necessary controlled experiments\non humans. Furthermore, such experiments are impractical because we\nlive too long for researchers to conveniently follow the development\nand evolutionary consequences of particular behavioral traits and\ntendencies. In addition, a common evolutionary investigative\ntechnique is to compare traits among closely related species. However\nas Sterelny and Griffiths (1999) point out, human beings are\nevolutionary orphans. Even though there are several species of\nnon-human primates that are extensively studied, they are simply not as\nnumerous, nor do they form as closely a related group of species with\nhumans, as can be found in, for example, groups of social ant or bee\nspecies. Finally, human behavior is complicated by intentionality,\nlanguage and culture, which make comparisons between human and\nnon-human animals challenging. For example, refer back\nMartin's (2003) critique of evolutionary explanations of\nrape. The notion of consent means something very different in a\nhuman as opposed to an animal context. As a result of limitations\ninherent to studying the evolution of human behavior, it is more\nchallenging to draw conclusions about human behavior than about the\nbehavior of many other groups of animals, and conclusions about human\nbeings might need to be more tentative than conclusions about other\norganisms. \n\nLack of attention to changing environments. There is a lack\nof good information about the environment, including the social\nenvironment, in which humans evolved. We know that there are\ndifferences among the environments in which people currently live and\nbetween current environments and early human environments. Postulating\nevolutionary adaptations only makes sense in reference to a particular\nenvironment because adaptations are responses to particular\nenvironmental challenges. A behavior may be an adaptation to a past\nenvironment and not benefit individuals in a current environment.\nAlternatively, a behavior may benefit an individual without being the\nresult of natural selection for that benefit. As a result, conclusions\ndrawn about the evolution of human behavior need to be\ntentative. \n\nAdaptationism (Failure to adequately consider causes of\nevolution other than natural selection). Causes of evolution other\nthan natural selection must be tested. For example, even if there\nare behaviors that are correlated with specific genes it does not\nfollow that the behavior is the result of natural selection and hence\nis an adaptation. Genes commonly have multiple effects and it is\npossible for natural selection to select for only one of those\neffects. In this case the other effect will increase in frequency\nin the population even though it is not selected for. A similar\ncase can occur when two genes are linked on the same chromosome.\nIn this way a behavior may be very common not because it confers an\nevolutionary advantage, but because it is associated with a different\nbeneficial trait. Other causes of evolution include random drift,\nmutation, and immigration of individuals between\npopulations. Recall that Elisabeth Lloyd (2003) identified\nadaptationism as a problem with Thornhill and Palmer's arguments\nabout the evolution of rape. \n\nLack of clear definitions of behavior. Behavioral traits\nneed to be clearly defined. For example, it is postulated that\nmales are naturally more aggressive than females. What counts as\naggression is unclear. Is it going to war, or punching another\nindividual, or having very active adrenal function? The\nappropriate grain of analysis is not clear. If one lives in a\nculture in which males are considered more aggressive than females,\nthen one may notice the higher proportion of men rather than women who\ncommit violent crimes and not notice cases of females fighting to\ndefend their offspring or competing with each other for\nresources. The issue of defining traits is not only a matter of\nclarity. Ontology is at stake because for evolutionary hypotheses\nto explain what exists in the world, our definitions must divide up the\nworld into traits that are passed from generation to generation and on\nwhich natural selection can act. \n\nProblematic choice of comparison species. The data\none can gather and the conclusions one can draw about human behavioral\nevolution from non-human primates are highly dependent on the primate\nspecies to which one attends. For example, in mid-20th century\nprimatology researchers chose species for study, such as savanna\nbaboons, which had social structures that seemed similar to\nhumans. In the 1970's feminist primatologists were\ninstrumental in convincing the scientific community that chimpanzees\nwere a more appropriate species for modeling key transitions in human\nevolution. This switch in model organism was supported by\nmolecular phylogenetic, comparative anatomical, and paleontological\ndata, but it was also a strategic feminist move, as chimpanzees are\nmatrifocal creatures with complex social lives. This facilitated\na research focus on mothering, which was consistent with the focus on\nmaternal thinking and social motherhood in that period of western\nfeminism (Haraway 1989). There are at least two kinds of\nrecommendations that arise here. First, if one is focusing on\nremoving bias, then one should take care not to falsely generalize\nacross the diversity that can be found among primate species (Hrdy\n1986). Second, one needs to take responsibility for one's\nchoice of model organism, because it will have an impact on the kinds\nof knowledge that one can produce (Haraway 1989). \n\nEvolutionary research regarding human behavior is especially\ndifficult to do well. It is very easy to take an aspect of human\nsocial behavior that seems universal to a particular group of\nresearchers, for example male aggression, and create a compelling but\nunsupported story about why that behavior enhances the survival and\nreproduction of individuals exhibiting it and hence\n‘explains’ why it is currently\n‘universal.’ In particular, there is little analysis\nof just what it is that makes these stories seem compelling or even\ncommonsensical. It is important to note that these just-so\nstories predominantly support the social status quo and traditional\nWestern, capitalist, patriarchal ‘virtues’ ranging from a\ntendency to be entrepreneurial and the inevitability of hierarchical\nsocial arrangements, to the naturalness of male promiscuity and\nviolence against women. Although some feminists are very pessimistic\nabout the possibility of conducting non-sexist research on the\nevolution of human behavior, there is not a general view within\nfeminist philosophy of biology that all sociobiological research is\nproblematic. In fact, some feminist critics and scientists use\nnon-sexist sociobiological research on non-human animals (for example\nthe work of Sarah Hrdy) to critique problematic evolutionary accounts of gendered\nbehavior. \n\nSexual selection and evolutionary accounts of behavior that relate\nto sex and gender are examples of two areas of science that have been\ntreated to extensive analysis by feminist philosophers of\nbiology. This entry now turns to common themes in feminist\nphilosophy of biology. \n\nAs previously stated, biological or genetic determinism is the view\nthat individual, low-level and often genetic factors are the primary\ncauses of biological phenomena. Feminists are concerned with\ndeterminism because it has been used to argue that political change is\nfutile because sex and gender at the individual and social level are\ncaused by a static, biological human nature. Feminists have\ncriticized biological or genetic determinism in a number of biological\ndisciplines. Within genetics and molecular biology researchers\nsuch as Evelyn Fox Keller (2000), Bonnie Spanier (1995) Ruth Hubbard\n(1990) and Anne Fausto-Sterling (1992) have pointed out the logical and\nempirical distance between an organism having a particular genotype and\nexpressing a particular phenotype, including behaviors. Non-feminist\nphilosophers of biology have also developed criticisms of biological\ndeterminism (an influential example is Richard Lewontin's book\nBiology as Ideology 1992). \n\nFor example, the causal relationship between genes and the\nparticular proteins that result in phenotypes is called the Central\nDogma. According to the Central Dogma, information flows from DNA to\nRNA to protein, and not in the other direction. DNA\nspecifies messenger RNA in a process called transcription.\nMessenger RNA plays a role in specifying the amino acid sequence of a\nprotein which is the fundamental structure of an organism's\nphenotype. Feminist and non-feminist philosophers of biology,\nalong with many biologists, have pointed out that this causal chain is\nextremely complicated and that a particular genotype can result in\ndifferent phenotypes in different contexts. There are gene regulation\nmechanisms that turn genes on and off, and control the rate of\ntranscription. There are hereditary mechanisms whereby once a\nportion of DNA is rendered inactive in a cell it remains inactive in\nall of that cell's descendents. The cellular environment\naffects what DNA is transcribed and the fate of particular DNA\ntranscripts. A sequence of DNA does not uniquely specify a\nparticular protein. The machinery of the cell processes the RNA\ntranscript. During this processing different portions of an RNA\nstrand can be spliced out resulting in a different end products, which\nmeans that same DNA sequence can result in different proteins and\ndifferent phenotypic traits. The nature of the relationship\nbetween a sequence of DNA and the traits of an organism is\ncomplicated. Although genes make a difference in an\norganism's phenotype, they are not the sole causes determining\nthat phenotype. Simple pictures of genetic determinism are not\nsupported by molecular biology. \n\nFeminist and non-feminist philosophers of biology have made it clear\nthat even if a trait is the result of evolution by natural selection,\nor in other words is an adaptation, it does not follow that the trait\nis uniformly expressed in a population or static in an individual over\ntime. Some adaptive traits are almost always present and others\nrequire very specific environmental conditions in order to\ndevelop. One could have the genetic correlate of a trait and that\ntrait could be the result of natural selection, and yet changing the\nenvironment could eliminate the expression of that trait. Some traits\nare adaptations to past environmental conditions and are not beneficial\nto organisms in current conditions. Some traits are present and\nvery beneficial, and yet are not the result of natural selection and\nhence are not adaptations. Simple pictures of biological determinism\nare thus not supported by evolutionary biology (for example see Keller\n2000). \n\nAnother aspect of biology that has been used to support determinist\narguments involves differences in male and female brains, and the\neffects of sex hormones on the expression of behavioral traits.\nFeminist responses in these areas primarily consist of careful analysis\nof studies used to support these determinist arguments. For\nexample, Bleier (1984) points out the futility of separating nature\nfrom nurture, or in other words the structural and hormonal aspects of\nbrain development, from social learning and environmental influences on\nbrain development. She points out that the fetal and postnatal\ndevelopment of the brain is highly influenced by environmental inputs,\nthe human brain exhibits high levels of developmental plasticity, is\nsensitive to experience, and finally that humans are very good at\nlearning. It is very difficult to determine whether or not\nsexually dichotomized behaviors, which may be correlated with genetic,\nhormonal or brain differences, are fixed or changeable. \n\nFeminist philosophers of biology, such as Bleier (1984) and\nFausto-Sterling (1992), reveal a series of problems with studies that\npurport to find sex differences in brain anatomy, brain lateralization,\nand hormones that are correlated with gender differences in behavioral\ntraits and abilities. These critiques include pointing out that\n(1) for most of the behavioral traits in question there is more overlap\nthan difference among populations of men and women, (2) these studies\nare often based on limited data and insufficient sample sizes, (3)\nthese studies often involve unwarranted extrapolation from rodent\nmodels to humans, (4) there are problems with the biological conversion\nof androgens to estrogens in the body that make it difficult to\ninterpret in vivo experiments, and finally (5) there is also a\ntendency to discount social causes of putative differences between the\nsexes (see also Fehr 2004). \n\nFeminist analyses of reductionism in biology concern the tendency to\nemploy methods that look for causes and explanations at low levels of\nbiological organization and within the system being studied. This\ncan lead researchers to ignore or undervalue the context in which a\nphenomenon is found, and hence to value genetic and physiological over\nsocial causes, and organismal over environmental factors. This\nview enables arguments for biological determinism, because it supports\nthe idea that the most important causes for a phenomenon, including\nhuman behavior and social organization, are within a person and at the\ngenetic level (Fehr 2004). Within a reductionist framework causes\nbased on environmental influences such as learning and social\nstructures are undervalued. \n\nFor example, feminists have scrutinized reductionism with regard to\nthe role of hormones in developmental biology in one of the most\nubiquitous model organisms, rats (Birke 1986, Longino and Doell 1983,\nLongino 1990). In an early model of this system, which Longino\nand Doell called the linear-hormonal model, prenatal and\nperinatal hormone levels are assumed to be the basis for behavioral sex\ndifferences. The assumption was that a gene on the Y chromosome\ntriggers the development of testes, and that the hormones released by\nthese brand new testes affect the structure of the rodent brain during\na critical developmental period. The presence of testes and the\nhormones that they produce were assumed to cause the male brain to\ndevelop such that the male performs ‘stereotypical’ male\nsexual behavior; in the absence of testes and the hormones that they\nproduce the female brain to develops in such a way as to cause the\nfemale to perform ‘stereotypical’ female behavior.\nLongino points out that in this explanatory model it is assumed that\nthere is a “unidirectional and irreversible sequence of\n(biochemical) events” (Longino 1990, 135). \nBirke writes of this early model: \n\nThis is a powerful model because it fits within a reductive\nframework (Fehr 2004). Genes cause anatomical differences, which cause\nhormonal differences, which cause brain differences, which cause\nbehavioral differences. Birke argues that the relationship\nbetween hormones and behavior is much more complicated than this tidy\nreductionist picture implies. She advocates an interactionist\nmodel instead of the linear-hormonal model. She points out\nthat research is beginning to embrace a much more complex picture of\nthe causes of sexual behavior, a picture that involves interactions\namong the mother, the fetus, the physiological and social environment\nas well as the genes, the internal anatomy and the brain structure of\nthe developing fetus. In this model, before birth the pups are\ninfluenced by factors such as the sex of other members of the litter,\nthe mother's environment, and the mother's hormonal\nstates. Birke writes, “Even before birth… it is\ndifficult to separate the individual pup and its hormones from a\nnetwork of complex processes” (Birke 1986, 97). After birth,\nfactors such as the pup's own hormones, maternal care (which is\ndifferential depending on the sex of the pup), the physical environment\nand the other pups influence adult sexual behavior. When the pup\nbecomes an adult, factors in its physical and social environment as\nwell as its hormonal states and its own behavior influence its sexual\nbehavior. The interactionist model does not ignore low level causes,\nsuch as genes or hormones, it simply refuses to privilege them over\nwhat may be thought of as higher level environmental and social causes\nof behavior.  \n\nIn this case, feminist analysis shows that uncritically embracing a\nreductive model overlooks other higher-level and environmental causes\nof behavior, and was involved in generating an alternative model that\nwas empirically testable. It is an example of both the critical\nand the constructive sides of feminist philosophy of biology.\nCritiques of reductionism are also common in non-feminist philosophy of\nbiology starting with the work of David Hull (1972,1974) (see the entry\non reductionism in biology for a thorough review). \n\nThere is significant feminist work on the role of gender-laden\nlanguage, and in particular of metaphor, in biology. Evelyn Fox\nKeller has done significant work on “Master Molecule”\ncharacterizations of DNA (1983, 1985). She has also argued that\ncultural norms enter into evolutionary biology, particularly\nmathematical ecology, due to a slippage between technical and\ncolloquial uses of the word “competition,” and that the\nlanguage of reproductive autonomy supports a bias towards individualism\nin biology (Keller 1992b). Emily Martin (1991) and the\nBiology and Gender Study Group (1988) both have shown that romantic\nmetaphors play a confounding role in biological descriptions of\nfertilization. In some cases, supporting false assumptions of\nfemale passivity, the egg is cast in the role of Sleeping Beauty that\nis awakened by the valiant sperm, which struggled to beat out its\nrivals and awaken the egg. In stories that acknowledge the\nactivity of the egg, it is cast in the role of femme fatale, snagging\nthe hapless sperm and dragging it into its clutches. Both sets of\nstories cohere with female stereotypes and neither of them clearly\ndescribes the reciprocal interactions between the egg and the sperm\nduring reproduction.  \n\nThere is strong support for several aspects of pluralism in feminist\nphilosophy of biology. This pluralism arises out of attention to\nthe complexity and heterogeneity of biological phenomena and the\ndifferent social and epistemic contexts in which research is\nconducted. It tends to focus on the multitude of ways that\nobjects and categories can be constructed and the differences among the\npartial perspectives of biologists who are differently situated (for\nexample those taking a feminist as opposed to a non-feminist\nperspective on their research) (Haraway 1988). This can result in\na willingness to see multiple explanations for the same phenomena as a\nvirtue that arises from attending to these ontological and/or epistemic\npossibilities (Longino 2002, Fehr 2004). For example, feminists\nhave critiqued “man-the-hunter” theories of human evolution\nbecause they focus on a single cause, hunting, of a complex and varied\nevolutionary history (Bleier 1984). They point out that while\nhunting played a role, gathering was likely the primary source of\nnutrition, and that the reciprocal interaction of many factors, such as\nthe development of language and culture, likely played important roles\nin the evolution of human beings.  \n\nFeminists have also been critical of tendencies to view nature in\nterms of sexualized dichotomies. This is evidenced in Anne\nFausto-Sterling's research on sexuality and intersexed\nindividuals (2000). She shows that biology and medicine,\nliterally, surgically construct intersexed individuals to fit more\nclosely into either one gender or the other. Feminist\nphilosophers of biology have been particularly vigilant in pointing out\nthe problems with the association of sexual dichotomies with male\nactivity and female passivity. This is supported by analyses,\ndiscussed above, of how the narrative of the sleeping egg being\nawakened by the sperm distorted our understanding of\nfertilization. There has also been work along these\nlines in analyses of developmental biology in which it is assumed that\nembryos develop along a female path by default unless a gene of the Y\nchromosome switches on the male pattern of development (Gilbert and\nRader 2001, Richardson 2008). Finally, there is significant\nnon-feminist work on pluralism in the philosophy of biology (for\nexample Dupré 1993, Kellert et al 2006, Fehr 2006). \n\nThere are at least three areas in which feminist philosophy of\nbiology can be fruitfully developed. First, it is striking that\nthere are many topics that feminist and non-feminist philosophers of\nbiology both address, but there is often a paucity of interactions\nbetween these two bodies of literature. For example, reductionism\nis a central area of investigation in both fields, and in both fields\nthere is generally an anti-reductionist consensus, yet feminist and\nnon-feminist philosophers of biology rarely cite each others'\nwork (for an exception see Dupré 2001). There is a wide range of\nanti-reductionist arguments on which feminists could draw and\nnon-feminists can be aided by careful considerations of the social and\npolitical impact of reductionism. More interaction between these\ngroups of scholars could be mutually beneficial.  \n\nSecond, there is room for further integrating feminist philosophy of\nbiology with feminist epistemology and philosophy of science.\nFeminist philosophy of biology includes a vast body of literature\ndocumenting the impact of sexism and androcentrism in both the practice\nof biology and the knowledge produced by biologists. There are\nsignificant opportunities to further develop this work in light of\nadvances in feminist and social epistemology. For example, it\nwould be interesting to consider many of the feminist criticisms of\ngender bias in biology from the perspective of social accounts of\nknowledge production or using Haraway's notion of situated\nknowledges. \n\nFinally, there are opportunities to develop feminist analyses on a\nwide range of topics in the biological sciences. These include\nmore contemporary scientific research on topics covered by classic\nworks in feminist philosophy of biology. For example Anne\nFausto-Sterling (1992) and Ruth Bleier (1984) critiqued research on\nsexual selection, and related work in sociobiology and evolutionary\npsychology, for focusing on individual sperm as a unit for determining\nthe male contribution to reproduction. Since then biological research\non sexual selection and Darwinian feminist approaches to sociobiology\nand evolutionary ecology (although little in evolutionary psychology)\nhave addressed this issue. There are opportunities for feminist\nphilosophers of biology to engage this shift in scientific research\nfocus. Opportunities also exist for feminist philosophy of\nbiology to analyze other topics and groups of researchers in the\nbiological sciences, including Darwinian feminist research on life\nhistory strategies and the evolution of male and female reproductive\nstrategies. Finally there are opportunities to develop feminist\nanalyses of topics that are relatively new such as research on genomics\nas it relates to gender (see the work Evelyn Fox Keller 2000).\nIn all of these areas of investigation there is room to ask questions\nabout the efficacy of the relevant scientific practices at producing\nmaximally accurate representations of gender as well as epistemic\nquestions rooted in recent work in feminist epistemology.","contact.mail":"carla.fehr@uwaterloo.ca","contact.domain":"uwaterloo.ca"}]
