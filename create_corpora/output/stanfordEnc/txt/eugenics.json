Its literal meaning—good\nbirth—suggests a suitable goal for all prospective parents, yet\nits historical connotations tie it to the selective breeding programs,\nhorrifying concentration camps, medical experiments, and mass\nexterminations promoted by Germany's Nazi regime in World War II.\nUndoubtedly, we have an obligation never to forget the Holocaust, or\nto allow history to repeat itself. Yet intuitively we have some moral\nobligation to promote good births—to have, in the most literal\nsense, eugenic aims. Indeed, if parents are encouraged to provide the\nbest environment for their children (good nutrition, education, health\ncare, a loving family situation, etc.), why not also encourage them to\nensure their children have good genes? If we have some moral\nobligation to secure the well-being of our future children (a question\nexplored extensively in the literature on the non-identity problem;\nsee the entry on the\n nonidentity problem),\n different questions come into focus: how far do such\nobligations extend, what justifies them, and can related contemporary\npractices be distinguished, in their aims, forms, justifications, and\nlikely consequences, from the clearly morally impermissible eugenic\nprograms of the past?\n\n\n\nPhilosophers have recently begun to explore the possibility of\n“liberal” as opposed to “authoritative”\neugenics (Agar 2004). Liberal eugenics would be based upon individual\nfree choice, pluralist values, and up-to-date scientific understanding\nof genetics and epigenetics. Furthermore, advocates of liberal\neugenics aim to be sensitive to the effects of problematic but deeply\nentrenched social problems (e.g., racism, sexism, heterosexism) on\nindividual choice. Authoritative eugenics programs, in contrast, were\ncoercive state programs designed to promote social goods, and were\nbased on problematic assumptions about hereditability. Liberal\neugenicists point to significant developments in our understanding of\ngenetics to help distinguish contemporary liberal eugenics from its\nproblematic predecessors. Indeed, scientific advances of the last\nseveral decades—years that include the advent of in vitro\nfertilization, the funding and completion of the Human Genome Project,\ncreation of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), and\nexpansions of pre-implantation screening and prenatal testing\npanels—provide not only more precise understandings of genes and\ntheir role in shaping phenotypes and gene-environment interactions,\nbut also a multitude of possibilities for intervention in the process\nof reproduction. How ought we to use this new knowledge and capacity?\nThis entry offers a short history of the eugenics movement, a survey\nof arguments that attempt to define and defend liberal eugenics, and\ncoverage of a variety of critiques of those arguments.\n\n\n\nAlthough philosophers have contemplated the meaning and value of\neugenics at least since Plato recommended a state-run program of\nmating intended to strengthen the guardian class in\nhis Republic, the modern version of eugenics had its start\nwith the 19th century cousin of Charles Darwin, British\nscientist Francis Galton (1883). Galton was interested in\n“improving human stock” through scientific management of\nmating; his explicit goal was to create better humans. His ideas were\ntaken up widely in the early part of the 20th century by\nseemingly well-intended scientists and policy makers, particularly in\nthe United States, Britain, and the Scandinavian countries. Notable\neugenicists included Alexander Graham Bell and Margaret Sanger. (For\nan excellent history of eugenics, see Kevles 1985.) \n\nEugenicists had two-fold aims: to encourage people of good health to\nreproduce together to create good births (what is known as\n“positive” eugenics), and to end certain diseases and\ndisabilities by discouraging or preventing others from reproducing\n(what is known as “negative” eugenics). In the United\nStates, programs to encourage positive eugenics involved the creation\nof “Fitter Family Fairs” in which families competed for\nprizes at local county fairs, much in the way that livestock is judged\nfor conformation and physical dexterity (Stern 2002). Negative\neugenics took the form of encouraged or forced sterilizations of men\nand women deemed unfit to reproduce (in the language of the day, this\nincluded individuals who were “poor, mentally insane,\nfeeble-minded, idiots, drunken” and more). At the time, many\neugenicists seemed to assume that social and behavioral conditions,\nsuch as poverty, vagrancy or prostitution, would be passed from parent\nto child, inherited as traits rather than shared as common social\nsituations. (For an interesting discussion of the relevant social\nmoral epistemology, see Buchanan 2007.)  \n\nRacist, sexist, and classist assumptions pervaded the discourse.\nAlarm calls were raised about the lower birth rates among white\nProtestant Americans compared to the large immigrant Catholic\npopulations of Italian and Irish descent. German scientists and\npolicymakers visited the United States to learn from their methods,\nand when the Nazis came to power in Germany, they began eugenic\npolicies of their own. Early German policies called for involuntary\neuthanasia of people in institutions whose physical or mental\nillnesses were considered incurable. Such individuals were considered\nto have “lives unworthy of life” (lebensunwertes\nLeben). The Nazis also encouraged selective breeding for Aryan\ntraits (e.g., athletic, blond and blue-eyed). This policy quickly\nexpanded to include bans on marriage between particular groups, forced\nsterilization, and then internment in concentration camps for\nindividuals belonging to groups deemed inferior (i.e., people who were\ndisabled, homosexual, diagnosed with psychiatric conditions,\ncommunists, considered to be Roma/gypsies, and/or Jewish). The\npurported aim was to promote the “health” of the German\npopulation by controlling those who were “unhealthy.”\nPrisoners faced extremely hard labor, medical experimentation that was\ntorturous and designed to test the limits of the human body (Lifton\n1986) and daily degradation and abuse.  Eventually, Nazis escalated\ntheir eugenic program to the “final solution” of death\ncamps, ultimately killing more than six million Jewish people in the\nname of promoting Germany's health. \n\nFollowing the end of WWII, the term “eugenic” was so\nclosely associated with the horrific programs of Nazi Germany that\neugenics societies across the world changed their names (e.g., the\nAmerican Eugenics Society became the Society for the Study of Social\nBiology) and tempered their aims. Yet many of the same practices and\nbeliefs continued under a different guise. Involuntary eugenic\nsterilizations of “feeble-minded” women in a variety of\nstates didn't officially end until the 1970s, and may continue covertly in some state institutions. California had the highest rate of\ninvoluntary sterilizations, which were widely performed on prison\ninmates, people in mental institutions, and women considered to be bad\nmothers. Such sterilizations were motivated by both perceived\nindividual and social goods, but had deep-seated prejudice as well as\nscientific inaccuracies built into their assumptions (Stern 2005).\nConcepts of “feeble-mindedness” were historically\nentangled in deeply problematic ways with ideas of race, class and\ngender (Stubblefield 2007). \n\nLater, attempts to promote positive eugenics were renewed with the\ncreation of the Repository for Germinal Choice, a sperm bank created\nin 1978 with the idea of collecting sperm from Nobel laureates, others\ndeemed “geniuses” and Olympic level athletes. Given the\navailability of in vitro fertilization, women could now\nchoose to reproduce with men presumed to have high-quality genes,\nwithout needing to form relationships with them. Although most Nobel\nprizewinners proved reluctant to donate to the sperm bank, the general\nidea took off. Even today, print and online ads in college newspapers\nregularly request sperm or eggs from donors who meet certain\nqualifications for health, intelligence, athleticism and/or\nattractiveness. Individuals or couples who require gamete donation to\nreproduce can shop around for a donor who meets their criteria. \n\nThe widespread practice of prenatal genetic testing (traditionally\nthrough chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis in the second\ntrimester of pregnancy, but now more routinely done through\nnon-invasive blood tests in the first trimester, at least as a first\nscreen), similarly presents the opportunity for individuals or couples\nto identify genes or genetic markers for traits they prefer for their\nfetuses not to have. If prenatal testing identifies an undesired gene,\nprospective parents may choose to continue the pregnancy, or to abort\nthe fetus, often with the plan to later attempt a new pregnancy.\nStudies suggest that in the United States, 90% of\n“positive” diagnoses from prenatal testing result in\nabortion (Rothschild 2005). With the advent of pre-implantation\ngenetic diagnosis, prospective parents can choose to use in\nvitro fertilization, and then test early cells of the created\nembryos to identify embryos with genes they prefer, or prefer to\navoid. In this way, they avoid the potential need for abortion by\nchoosing to implant only embryos that contain the desired genes. The\naim of this practice certainly appears eugenic, though without an\nobviously coercive structure, and for the benefit of the individual\nfamily. The profession of genetic counseling, started in the 1990s,\nprovides prospective parents with detailed information about the\nmeaning of the tests, and the opportunity for discussion of test\nresults. In part due to concerns about eugenic overtones, genetic\ncounseling is built on a policy of “non-directiveness” to\nensure that the reproductive autonomy of prospective parents is\nrespected. That tenet of genetic counseling has been challenged by\nscholars who argue that we ought to balance parental autonomy with the\nchild's future autonomy (see, e.g., Davis 2010). \n\nFinally, advances in genetic technology suggest the possibility that\nour ability to test for (if not manipulate directly) a much larger\narray of genes and genetic markers related to a wide variety of\ndiseases and traits may be on the near horizon. Prenatal testing\npanels currently include attention to conditions such as Trisomy 13,\nTrisomy 18, Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome), Tay-Sachs, and more. Yet we\nallow adults to be tested for genetic markers linked to late onset\ndisorders such as breast cancer, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's\ndisease. Should such genetic tests be available on prenatal testing\npanels if parents request them? Or for all prospective parents who\nrequest prenatal testing? What about other additions that might be of\ninterest to particular parents, even if the genetic linkages to the\nparticular traits are less direct or even only mildly predictive:\ndiabetes, obesity, homosexuality, or psychiatric conditions such as\nbipolar disorder or schizophrenia? (Informative discussions of the\nexpansion of genetic testing can be found in Davis 2010 and Botkin\n2003.) Deciding how to deal with the vast array of potentially\ngenetically-linked markers—as a society, and potentially as\nindividual prospective parents—is a monumental task that\nrequires clarity about the benefits and drawbacks of testing, and\nrequires us to revisit the meaning of eugenics, and the problems\nassociated with it. \n\nA much simpler and more clearly linked trait of interest is\nchromosomal sex. In the United States, parents can choose to find out\ntheir fetus's chromosomal sex via amniocentesis, or through an\nincreasing number of early first trimester blood tests. In the U.K.,\nby contrast, parents typically do not learn the sex of their fetus\nuntil birth, a policy put in place by the Human Fertility and\nEmbryology Authority (HFEA) with the aim of avoiding sex\ndiscrimination and shoring up the line between genetic intervention\nfor disease and non-disease traits. One of the concerns raised by\ncritics of sex selection is what Mary Ann Warren deemed gendercide, in\nher book of the same name (Warren 1985). Indeed, evidence from around\nthe world suggests a relatively strong bias in favor of male children\n(South Korea is now an exception), or at least male children first\n(Davis 2010). China and India, countries where cultural norms and\npractices still decidedly favor men, are facing significant sex ratio\nimbalances as a result of the use of technologies (and non-technical\npractices such as infanticide) to select against girls (for a\ndiscussion, see Davis 2010: Chapter 5). In response to concerns about\nsex ratios and underlying sexism, the American Congress of\nObstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recommended a policy of\nonly allowing sex selective interventions to be used to avoid\nsex-linked diseases, or for “family balancing” purposes\n(e.g., only for the second child in a family)(ACOG 2007). Concerns\nabout the uses of sex selective technologies against a background of\nunjust sexism (see Bayles 1984; Rogers et al. 2007) illustrate the\ndifficulties of arguing straightforwardly for unfettered reproductive\nchoice about the traits of children. \n\nAs this short history should make clear, past, state-run, involuntary\neugenic endeavors have been unjust and socially disastrous.  Yet\ncertain practices that have eugenic features continue today, albeit\nframed differently. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic\ndiagnosis, for instance, are understood to enhance patient choice and\nexpand prenatal knowledge, even as they are clearly used by\nprospective parents to determine which individuals should come into\nexistence.  Should they be considered eugenic practices? Is that\nnecessarily morally troubling? As technological advances push us to\nfigure out how many more, if any, kinds of genes and genetic markers\nwe ought to be able to test for or choose prenatally, we may need to\nreassess our current practices to explore their justifications, and\nsort through the ways in which they are eugenic and potentially\nmorally troubling.\n  \n\nAdvocates of liberal eugenics intend to distinguish it from troubling\nhistorical predecessors by highlighting four main differences. First,\nit is individual in nature rather than state-sponsored. The\nintended benefit of any eugenic intervention is individual/private\nwelfare (that of the child-to-be, or of the family), rather than the\nwelfare of the state as a whole. Second, it is premised on\nindividual liberty, the freedom of parents to choose\naccording to their own values and conceptions of the good life. The\nstate does not mandate contraception, sterilization, prenatal testing,\nabortion, or any other form of eugenic intervention (note: there are\npotential exceptions in which judges or states have offered long-term\ncontraception such as Norplant as a condition of probation related to\na criminal offense or for the continued provision of welfare, see\ne.g., Dresser 1996). Rather, it allows individuals to choose among a\nrange of alternatives. Third, it presumes value pluralism,\nrecognizing that individual parents will often desire different things\nfor their offspring. This means allowing others to choose in ways that\nwe ourselves would not, in the interest of preserving a liberal\nsociety that is neutral about particular conceptions of the good. The\naim of a liberal eugenic program is to expand reproductive\nchoices for individuals, in contrast to the historical eugenic\nprograms that clearly cut off reproductive options for many. (That\nsaid, even liberal eugenics advocates typically presume\nthat some limits would need to be in place, to ensure that\nprospective parents could not act in ways clearly contrary to the\ninterests of their future children, or in ways that seem clearly\nvicious; how and where those limits would be set are intensely\ncontroversial, as will be discussed below.) Finally, advocates of\nliberal eugenics highlight the difference between the kind and quality\nof the science underlying the reproductive policies. Past eugenic\nprograms relied on views of race, intelligence, and genetics that\nwere, from our current perspective, “hopelessly wrong”\n(Agar 2004: 7). A cursory summary of these kinds of distinctions\nbetween old and “new” eugenics can be found in Caplan\n2004, and the same collection of distinctions underlies most liberal\nor “new” eugenic arguments.  \n\nMany theorists argue in favor of permitting parents to make choices\nabout their children's genetics, while explicitly arguing against any\nobligation to improve or enhance their children. Such arguments run\nthe gamut from a completely laissez-faire market system—or\n“genetic supermarket”—of the sort considered by\nRobert Nozick (1974: 315) to a more highly regulated system, with\ncontrols to protect the well-being of future children as well as\nsocially valued goods (e.g., rough equality, efforts to eliminate\ndiscrimination) that might be put at risk in a completely free market\nenvironment. Common to these arguments is a presumption that treatment\nof disease may be obligatory, while enhancement is not. (For an\nexcellent discussion of this distinction and its problems, see Parens\n1998a.) \n\nLiberal eugenics arguments often start by recognizing the value of\ntreatment of disease. Disease, typically defined as a negative\ndeparture from species typical functioning (Boorse 1975; Daniels\n1994), can interfere with an individual's participation in society\nand/or individual flourishing. Buchanan et al. (2000) link disease to\na reduction of opportunity, and so argue that provision of medical\ntreatment for disease is a way for the state to promote equality of\nopportunity. Parents are obliged to ensure that their children get\nmedical treatment for disease, and can be charged with negligence if\nthey fail to do so. Only diseases that result in relatively small\nnegative effects on participation (e.g., mild asthma) or where the\noverall benefits of treatment are still somewhat uncertain (e.g., some\ncancer treatments) can go untreated. Parents whose conceptions of the\ngood life do not include medical treatment for disease—as in\nsome religious communities—are not allowed to impose this view\non their children, because the children deserve the opportunity to\nchoose to adopt those views or not when they are adults.  Mandatory\nlife-saving treatment of their childhood diseases helps to ensure that\nthey survive to make such decisions as adults (Feinberg 1980). This\nrequirement has been the subject of some debate (see, e.g., DesAutels,\nBattin and May 1999). \n\nBuchanan et al. (2000) note that as technology advances, theories of\njustice need no longer consider “natural inequalities” to\nbe given, or outside the scope of distribution. If equality of\nopportunity is one of the aims of a society, then, provision of\ncertain forms of genetic intervention—including interventions\nthat determine who will be brought into existence—may\nbecome owed to future people. If parents can decide between\nimplanting an embryo that carries a genetic marker associated with a\nserious disease— e.g., Tay Sachs—or an embryo without that\nmarker, they would be obliged to choose the latter, in the name of\npromoting the health and well-being of the future child (impersonally,\nperhaps, given the non-identity problem). To be clear, though, they do\nnot suggest that all prospective parents would be obliged to seek\nreproductive counseling and use in vitro fertilization in\norder to fulfill their parenting or impersonal duties. Such a\nrequirement would be overly demanding on parents and an infringement\non their procreative liberty, and would be unlikely to succeed in any\ncase, given the prohibitive costs and relatively low success rates of\nIVF treatment. Most liberal eugenics advocates (Agar 2004; Glover\n2006; Green 2007) move from a commonly accepted position of the\nrequirement to treat serious diseases in children, to a requirement\nfor people using genetic interventions (e.g., pre-implantation genetic\ndiagnosis or perhaps one day technology to create “designer\nbabies”) in reproduction to use them in ways that avoid serious\ndiseases.  The obligation doesn't extend to mandates on prenatal\ntesting or abortion to avoid giving birth to a child with a serious\ndisease, because of considerations related to women's rights to their\nbodies and religious freedom. \n\nTreatments for disease aside, liberal eugenics advocates recognize\nthat many prospective parents may be interested in enhancing their\nchildren. Why settle for the likelihood of normal functioning if one\ncould safely engineer improvements in functioning? At least two\nreasons lead most such theorists to stop short of advocating a moral\nobligation to enhance. First, there is the difficulty of determining\njust what counts as an improvement (beyond addressing serious\ndisease). Second, many see value in diversity and in allowing many\nMillian “experiments in living” to take place. For\ninstance, Agar (2004) questions whether it is obviously better for a\nchild to be highly intelligent (roughly approximated by a likely IQ of\n160). Might some parents reasonably choose a more moderate level of\nintelligence for a child, presuming he will have greater social\nopportunities in the latter case? Perhaps the overall freedom of the\nchild of moderate intelligence will be greater than that of the child\nwith high intelligence, even though on that one dimension his\ncapacities are comparatively lower. Erik Parens' provocatively titled\nessay—“Is Better Always Good?” (Parens\n1998a)—suggests we may have reason to question the general\nnotion that adding more of a capacity is good. The chapters in Parens'\nedited volume Enhancing Human Traits (Parens 1998b) point to\na variety of ways the enhancement project might be misled by a\nseemingly valuable target that ends up producing negative effects or\nundermining other values we cherish. Additionally, even if many people\nagree on the value of an enhancement and it becomes so common that\npractically its possession is required for equal participation in\nsociety, we might want to resist the temptation to make that\nintervention obligatory. For example, Agar (2004: 85)\nsuggests this might happen with the trait “being somewhat\nhappier than is now normal” if treatment tied to 5-HTTLPR, a\ngenetic marker associated with upbeat temperament, became common. The\nnow-typical temperament is not a disease, but a mere variety within\nthe capacious normal range of functioning, and would likely remain so\neven in a future society of 5-HTTLPR-enhanced\npeople. A liberal eugenics cannot mandate any one view of the\ngood life for its citizens. \n\nStill, even mere permissibility to use genetic enhancements raises\nsignificant moral concerns. Critics fear obsessively focused\nprospective parents who design their children in ways that are\noverbearing or narrowly focused on a particular goal of the parents\n(Kass 2003; Sandel 2007). To avoid this problem, liberal eugenics\nadvocates propose various limits on genetic interventions for\nenhancement purposes. There is widespread agreement that interventions\nshould not harm the future child (by creating a life so miserable as\nto be not worth living, as might be the subject of a wrongful life\nsuit).  Beyond that, variations include, for instance: (1) only\nenhancements that will benefit the future children no matter what life\nplan they decide to pursue and that do not reinforce problematic\nsocial norms (Agar 2004), or (2) only enhancements that preserve a\nchild's right to an open future (Davis\n2010), or (3) only\nenhancements that preserve open futures and protect some central core\nof our human nature (Glover 2006), or (4) only enhancements that\nrational people will agree can be understood to be in the best\ninterest of the child (Green 2007). \n\nHow might one harm a child through choosing genetic traits? Perhaps by\nselecting for traits that clearly cause significant suffering and a\ntypically short life span (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease, Lesch-Nyan\nsyndrome). Such a requirement may seem a bit unnecessary, given that\nmost parents do not intentionally desire painful states for their\nchildren, and would not seek to engineer them in this way. Also,\nrelatively few genetic conditions will be so inherently debilitating\nas to make life obviously miserable, to the extent that one could not\nsay that life is, on balance, a benefit. \n\nThe more contentious territory has to do with choosing between lives\nthat would be worth living, but have different features. How might we\nensure a child's capacity to choose from a variety of life plans, or\nthe right to an open future? Davis argues that “parents ought\nnot deliberately to substantively constrain the ability of their\nchildren to make a wide variety of life choices when they become\nadults” (Davis 2010: 84). In other words, if they use\ngenetic interventions in reproduction, they must not use them to\nnarrow the range of options their child will likely have. So parents'\nchoices must not substantively diminish the future options for their\nchildren, though they might in some way alter the range or nature of\nthose futures possibilities. For Agar, the phrasing is slightly\ndifferent: parents must not “infringe on a child's ability to\nchoose a life plan and to successfully pursue it” (2004:\n102). He employs Sen's capabilities approach, identifying various\nimportant human capabilities that individuals ought to have, and can\nthen decide whether or not to exercise as they pursue their chosen\nlife plans. \n\nDavis and Agar both point to deafness as a useful case for\nclarification. If hearing is a core human capacity, or even if it is\nsimply necessary for a wide variety of life plans, then engineering a\nchild to be deaf will limit that child's future options. This is not,\nof course, to say that deaf individuals cannot live rewarding lives in\nwhich they flourish. Indeed, Agar recognizes that in some\ncircumstances, lacking a capacity like hearing will only lead to a\nsmall difference in relative freedom, and if so, then we might not\nhave a “general requirement to replace genetic arrangements\nlinked with deafness” (2004: 105). On his view, prospective\nparents could engineer a child to be hearing because it would increase\nher real freedom, but could not engineer a child to be deaf, though\nthey might be permitted to leave a deaf fetus/child deaf. Weighing in\non the now widely analyzed case of two Deaf (the capital\n“D” marks membership in the linguistic-cultural group of\nthe Deaf; a small “d” only signifies the physical state of\nthe body) women who sought out a deaf sperm donor in hopes of having a\ndeaf child (Spriggs 2002; Mundy 2002), Agar argues that they reduced\ntheir child's real freedom by attempting to ensure that he would be\ndeaf. (One might still wonder whether their method of reproducing\nshould even count as an enhancement technology for Agar, given that\nhad one of the women simply partnered with the deaf man, the genetic\ndeafness of their child would not be an issue of engineering.) Davis,\ntoo, acknowledges the claims of Deaf culture, and the reasons parents\nmight prefer to have a child more like themselves, but argues that\ndeliberately trying to conceive a child who will have relatively\nlimited options—limited, in her view, not just due to enduring\ndiscrimination and social constraints, but also to bodily\ndeficits—is morally impermissible. \n\nA somewhat different argument is offered by Green (2007), who rejects\nthe “right to an open future” language, in part because he\nthinks parents must be allowed to do things that are more for their\nown interests than for the sake of their children, even when doing so\naffects how the children develop. He argues that parents are allowed\nto  mold the child's nature in directions shaped by the\nparents' own hopes for their child, including the use of gene\nmodification… [W]ithin limits, parents have the right to impose\ntheir dreams on a child. (2007: 127) \nFollowing William Ruddick, he thinks of parents as both guardians and\ngardeners (2007: 125)—protecting their children so that they can\ngrow as they will, but also shaping how they grow in line\nwith the parents' hopes. Because he thinks “parental love almost\nalways prevails” (2007: 114)—when we are faced with the\nactual child of ours, we will (typically) love it, regardless of its\ntraits—he finds it morally acceptable that parents might want to\nchoose traits for their children that do not strictly speaking\npreserve an open future. If parents want a child with a good shot at\nan athletic career, for instance, why not allow them to engineer for\nathleticism or great vision? Doing so might narrow other life\nopportunities, but not to the extent that the child couldn't choose\nhow his life goes. His future would still be open enough. \n\nGreen emphasizes parental reproductive autonomy, and the continuum\nbetween shaping the future possibilities for our existing children\nthrough parental values, education, religion, and more, and doing so\nthrough genetic interventions. Although he acknowledges the\npossibility that   subtle types of pressure that the\ncritics fear—coercion from non-governmental actors and\nself-coercion as parents race to keep up with the Joneses—could\nhappen, (2007: 164) \nhe dismisses these worries as overstated, and not significantly\ndifferent from pressures we already experience and apparently find\nacceptable. Green's central recommendation, then, is that genetic\ninterventions should be aimed at what is reasonably in the\nchild's best interests (2007: 216), recognizing that the parents' own\ninterests are also relevant. By “reasonably” he means\nthat   it is not enough for parents to think that\nsomething is in their child's best interests; their judgment must\naccord with that of most other informed members of society; (2007:\n216) \nonce that condition is satisfied, parents would be permitted to\nchoose, according to their own tastes and preferences, within a wide\nrange of options of relatively “all-purpose” traits (2007:\n218). Just who the “informed” members of society are, is\nof course, a matter of some contention (for discussion, see Hayry\n2010). \n\nChildren's future options can, of course, be limited due to the makeup\nof their bodies, or to the unwelcoming or oppressive social situations\ninto which they are born, or both. Given the history of eugenics, most\nliberal eugenics advocates recognize the need to attend carefully to\nunjust social circumstances and to control for existing bias. For\ninstance, if we could change a child's future sexuality through\ngenetic intervention, it might appear that we should permit parents to\nengineer in either direction, because heterosexuality and\nhomosexuality both permit the successful pursuit of a wide variety of\nlife plans. But if we attend to current social situations, we will\nrecognize that homophobia is still common in many quarters, despite\nadvances in anti-discrimination legislation and improvements in at\nleast some conscious attitudes, and people who identify as homosexual\nare more likely to experience social ostracism, bullying, and physical\nassault. As such, engineering a homosexual child might appear to\ndecrease a child's future options in this society. Thus, if\nwe take the social situation into account, we would only allow\nengineering to create heterosexual children. Yet doing so would\n“end up colluding with prejudice, worsening its effects”\n(Agar 2004: 109–110). \n\nGiven existing social norms—even those that are unjust—one\nmight worry that a “free market” approach to genetic\nenhancement of future children would result in pressure toward\nhomogeneity. Parents who are free to choose characteristics for their\noffspring may be inclined to choose similarly, either because they\nagree (perhaps wrongly) that those characteristics are better, or\nbecause they worry their child will be at a substantial disadvantage\nrelative to other children if they choose what is unpopular (or simply\nfail to intervene to ensure what is popular). If so, societal\npressures on parental choices will have effects similar to policies\nenforced by a state—homogeneity of traits selected across the\npopulation. In this case, it appears that enhancement technologies\n“will grant racism and homophobia an unprecedented\nefficacy” (Agar 2004: 148) and as such, “concern for\nprospective welfare may result in genocide by stealth” (2004:\n149). Davis (2010) shares this kind of concern, but focuses more on\nsex selection than selection in respect to sexual orientation. \n\nOne way to address this problem is to note that some characteristics\nwill only be harmful to the individual in a morally defective social\nenvironment, while others will be harmful regardless of the\nenvironment (e.g., for Agar, this gets to the difference between\ngenetic markers linked to homosexuality and deafness, respectively,\n2004: 151). In the first case, we seem to misdiagnose the problem if\nwe think altering the genome will help address it. What we need to do\ninstead is change attitudes and social practices. In the second case,\nhowever, he argues that the condition itself (deafness) limits options\nfor the child, even if we can recognize some of the disadvantages of\nthe condition to be social. \n\nWe might nevertheless think it could be permissible to use genetic\nengineering to address social problems, if the genetic interventions\nare at hand and would reduce some suffering, and the social solutions\nare distant and rather unlikely. For instance, Agar acknowledges that\nit would be preferable to eliminate racism (2004: 155), but given how\nentrenched it is in many societies, he considers whether we might want\nto allow some genetic interventions (e.g., engineering lighter skin\ntone) that could help individuals avoid suffering from it. Ultimately,\nhowever, he claims that we should not allow this kind of genetic\nengineering—not simply because it seems to collude with a\nmorally defective social environment, but because\nit reinforces and perhaps exacerbates that\nenvironment (it undermines work toward changing the morally defective\nsocial environment) (2004: 156–157).  \n\nGreen also recommends against interventions that would reinforce or\nincrease unjust inequality and discrimination, economic inequality, or\nracism (2007: 216–226), but he does so with some reservations.\nParents understandably might want to reduce social burdens on their\nchildren through genetic interventions, and if we make doing so\nillegal, they will likely go elsewhere or underground to get what they\nwant. He also—optimistically—suggests that stereotypes and\nfashions ebb and flow, and may be self-corrective (2007: 227). \n\nSome advocates of liberal eugenics more carefully explore the\npossibility that our current social norms might be “morally\ndefective” in respect to disability. For instance, Glover\ndefends the permissibility of parental choice within some limits, but\nhe investigates just what counts as a disability. He proposes that a\ndisability involves a functional limitation that “impairs the\ncapacity for human flourishing” (2006: 9), either by itself or\nin conjunction with social disadvantage. Thus, although racism results\nin social disadvantage, having dark skin is not itself a disability,\nbecause it has no associated functional limitation. Some conditions\npreviously considered disabilities—e.g.,\nachondroplasia—need not be disabilities at all, according to\nthis view (for more on achondroplasia, see Miller 2006 and Davis\n2010).  Glover understands “functional limitations” as a\ncontrast to normal human functioning, a species-based notion that\nitself involves significant degrees of variation and the matter of\nsetting (rather than discovering) boundaries. As such,\n“normal” is not purely statistical, but also partly\nnormative (see also Buchanan et al. 2000). Glover recognizes the\nconceptual messiness of “normal functioning” but still\nprefers it to alternatives. If an individual prefers a bodily state\nthat might otherwise count as a functional limitation (his example is\nAsperger's syndrome), then it isn't a disability for her\n(2006: 14); it doesn't affect her flourishing. He is much less\nsanguine about blindness and deafness. Both conditions, he suggests,\nconfer significant functional limitations, and although\nthey can certainly allow individuals to have lives of great\nworth and flourishing—he explores conflicting first person\naccounts about going blind and gaining sight to explore the positive\nsides of the conditions and the negative side of normalizing (2006:\n15–22)—he concludes that they are nonetheless disabilities\nthat confer clear disadvantages (related to navigation, safety,\netc.). As such, they can be understood to be disabilities that are\nunderstandably acceptable to some, but that ought not be chosen for\nfuture children. Such future children, like their parents, might be\nable to flourish with the condition, but engineering it means\nintentionally impairing at least some capacities commonly relevant to\nflourishing. Interestingly, Glover concludes that the Deaf lesbian\ncouple who sought a deaf sperm donor did nothing wrong in conceiving\ntheir deaf child (the child cannot be harmed by his clearly worthwhile\nexistence), but he argues they would be wrong in not giving him a\ncochlear implant if the technology were perfected (2006:\n26). Glover's attention to the difficulty of defining disability is\nhelpful, and he emphasizes the importance of taking seriously the\nperspectives of people who have lived with the disabilities in\nquestion. Such first person accounts are, however, but one source of\ninformation about the relative value of the condition in question. \n\nA different sort of societal harm that might follow from the\npermissibility of genetic enhancement is increasing polarization\nbetween people who have the finances to afford genetic enhancements,\nand those who do not. The wealthy already have advantages; if we allow\nthem to give their children genetic enhancements—such that they\nare smarter, faster, stronger, and with less need to sleep,\netc.—they will be ever more competitive, and liable to increase\nthe divide between rich and poor. (Lee Silver explores this dystopian\npossibility with the GenRich and the Naturals in his Remaking\nEden, 1997.) One way to avoid the problem would be to attempt to\nmake genetic enhancements available to all, at least for enhancements\nthat offer significant advantages (Buchanan 2011). Traits that only\noffer positional advantages—being taller than, perhaps faster\nthan—would then be self-defeating (Buchanan et al. 2000) if\navailable to all, and the allure might fade. Other\ntraits—perhaps enhanced concentration, memory, or\nimmunity—might be advantageous regardless of how many people\nhave them. Providing funding to improve accessibility would then be\nnecessary in order to ensure fairness. Many proponents of liberal\neugenics treat the threat of polarization as a relatively minor\nconcern. For example, Green (2007) notes that all innovations have a\nperiod of diffusion, during which early adopters pay higher prices and\ntake some risks for the potential of leading the way forward, and\nthen, if the technology is successful, prices drop and the wider\npublic gains access through the market. In Beyond Humanity,\nBuchanan compares genetic intervention to literacy, numeracy and\nagriculture: these innovations were only available to a few at the\nstart, but that does not take away from their great benefits to\nhumanity.  \n\nIn addition to considering concerns about social effects of genetic\nenhancement related to homogeneity and polarization, Glover also looks\nat whether we need to resist some forms of genetic enhancement in\norder to defend a “central core of human nature” (2006:\n81). What might that be? Not simply all the functional states we\ncurrently have—those could well change over time, perhaps for\nthe better.  Indeed, some advocates of liberal eugenics are\nparticularly attentive to the “status quo bias” (Green\n2007; Bostrom and Ord 2006) and likely unjustifiable intuitions that\nour present nature is worth preserving (Buchanan 2011). Nonetheless,\nGlover proposes two potential features of great value in our current\nnature: our capacity to rein in our violent and destructive\ntendencies, and our capacity to aim for a good life (for Glover, this\nis about a balance between happiness and flourishing). These are very\ntentatively offered, with many qualifications about possible linkages\nto other traits of value, and the likelihood that we might be more\nsuccessful in securing containment through non-genetic means. Still,\nthe suggestion is that if parents might be tempted to select for\ngenetic markers linked to, for instance, extreme selfishness or\nemotional coldness, in an attempt to have their child succeed in\ngaining power and riches, doing so would seem to endanger parts of our\nnature that we can widely agree are deeply valuable for society as a\nwhole. Therefore, on Glover's view, even a liberal eugenics should\nexclude such choices. \n\nIn sum, theorists who argue for the permissibility of genetic\nenhancement emphasize the need to protect the future child's options,\nso long as doing so does not reinforce unjust social prejudices or\nthreaten deeply held core values. At the same time, they seek to\npreserve parental reproductive autonomy, and to expand rather than\nreduce parental options. One problem with this thesis, to be explored\nmore in depth below in the section on critiques, is the appropriate\nscope of its central claims. Some critics (e.g., Asch 2000; Saxton\n2000; Sparrow 2005), for instance, suggest that it fails to recognize\nthat many of the presumptions about social prejudice could be extended\nto prejudice against people with disabilities, many of whom live\nrelatively well with traits or characteristics that genetic enhancers\nmay well desire to eliminate or attempt to improve upon. If we ought\nnot collude with and exacerbate the social prejudices of sexism and\nracism through our reproductive genetic choices, why is doing the same\nfor ableist norms permissible? The cynical critic might wonder if\nthere are, in fact, any traits that will meet the criteria for being\nrelatively all-purpose enhancements (Sparrow 2011b; Trommelmans\n2006). Other critics express concern about the meaning and value of\nrelative freedom, particularly when identifying what counts\nas a decrease in freedom seems to depend significantly on the\npositioning and values of the particular prospective parent or\ncultural community (Sparrow 2005). When one parent insists that\ngetting rid of a trait will increase her child's relative freedom and\nthe group of people who live with that trait point to the ways that\nthe choice contributes to and reinforces social prejudice against\ntheir group (Lane and Grodin 1997; Saxton 2000; Asch 2000), how are we\nto proceed with the regulation of “liberal” eugenics? \n\nAgar forthrightly declares,  I have argued that the addition of the word\n“liberal” to “eugenics” transforms an evil\ndoctrine into a morally acceptable one. (2004: 135) \nFor him, that single word changes the fundamental assumptions about\nhow and why genetic interventions are pursued. Liberal states remain\nneutral about what constitutes the good life, but impose certain\nrestrictions (laws, policies) and offer education or aid (public\nhealth campaigns, food stamps) in the name of ensuring that citizens\nare safe, relatively stable, and have equal opportunity to pursue\ntheir goals.  But critics point out the many ways that a collection of\nindividual choices, pressured by unjust social norms and assumptions,\nmay lead to results not wholly unlike those of historical eugenics\nprograms (Duster 1990). They fear that regulations put in place by\nadvocates—whether in the form of laws, restrictions of the use\nof federal or state funds, or mere recommendations or guidelines from\nmedical societies—will not be sufficient to avoid the negative\nconsequences of eugenic enhancement. Green optimistically suggests, in\nthe final line of his book, “By moving responsibly into this\nemerging era of genetic choice, we can incorporate gene technology\ninto the ongoing human adventure” (2007: 230). Groups who have\nexperienced significant discrimination over many generations will\nunderstandably reject such optimism. Such groups have more to fear,\nhowever, from those who do not merely argue for permission to enhance,\nbut for an obligation to do so. \n\nOther advocates of liberal eugenics (e.g., Harris 2000, 2007;\nSavulescu 2001; Kahane and Savulescu 2008) recognize the potential\nbenefits of genetic enhancement, and forthrightly argue in favor of\nmoral obligations to pursue them. Some such enhancements might be\nrelatively minor, while others might be radical enough to eventually\ncreate a new species (Glover 2006). These arguments for the obligation\nto enhance tend to arise in the context of consequential moral\nreasoning, but with a libertarian qualification. According to early\nwork by Savulescu, for instance, parents have an obligation to produce\nthe best children possible, but the state need not (indeed, should\nnot) legally coerce them to do so (Savulescu 2001). To the contrary,\nthe state must balance the benefits of potential enforcement against\nits existing obligations to protect reproductive liberties.\nNonetheless, the state might have good reason to encourage parents to\ntake such action, through education and persuasive campaigns (not\nunlike anti-smoking campaigns). On this stronger view, others, too,\nwould be right to express disapproval:  Egregious procreative choices deserve our disapproval\njust like other failures to meet one's obligations, such as failure to\nprotect the welfare of one's children. (Kahane and Savulescu 2008:\n278) \nA similar position is advocated by Harris (2007). Although the\narguments are about a moral obligation to enhance, the\nauthors recognize that other competing priorities (e.g., autonomy of\nparents, welfare of other siblings, harm to others) could potentially\ntrump this obligation. \n\nSavulescu's early paper on the obligation to intervene genetically\nargued for a seemingly perfectionist stance—if we decide to\nreproduce, we are morally obligated to have the best children we, as\nparents, can have. His Principle of Procreative Beneficence (PPB)\nholds that   couples (or single reproducers) should select the\nchild, of the possible children they could have, who is expected to\nhave the best life, or at least as good a life as the others, based on\nthe relevant available information. (2001: 415)  \nThis obligation can't be owed to any particular child (given the\nnon-identity problem), but is an impersonal obligation, to make the\nworld a better place. If parents are using pre-implantation genetic\ndiagnosis, they should always choose the embryo with the best chances\nat the best life. If our best genetic information suggests that one\nembryo has a chance of mild asthma, and the other does not, and they\nare alike in other respects, Savulescu claims it is obvious that the\nparents should choose the embryo not inclined to asthma. He also\noffers a much longer list of traits that may have genetic markers,\nincluding bipolar disorder, alcoholism, aggression and criminal\nbehavior, memory and intelligence, neuroticism, and maternal behavior\n(2001: 417). Why?  Even if these are not all disease-genes, they are\nlinked to conditions that can positively or negatively influence how a\nlife will go.  Savulescu imagines that the rational parent could make\nno other decision but to avoid the negative linkages and promote the\npositive ones, where possible. \n\nDeciding which traits are positive, and of those, which are better\nthan others, is a task that will not be simple. “The most\nadvantaged child” is inherently comparative. Critics point to\nthe difficulty of ranking the expected well-being of future possible\nlives, given 1) disagreement about what is positive and negative (and\nthe need to contextualize that in a particular environmental and\nfamily situation), and 2) the reality that most embryos will have a\ncomplex mixture of positive and negative traits making meaningful\npairwise comparisons very difficult (de Melo Martin 2004; Parker\n2007). Kahane and Savulescu reply that we do this kind of ranking all\nthe time, and that it needn't rely on a single vision of what a\nperfect child would be.  [A]iming at the best is compatible with thinking that\nthe concept of the most advantaged life is plural and open-ended. If\ndifferent forms of life are equally good, or if the amount of\nwell-being realized in each is incomparable, then parents can\nreasonably choose either option. But there are plenty of cases where\nwe can rank the goodness of lives. We do so in numerous moral\ndecisions in everyday life, especially in bringing up and educating\nour children. (Kahane and Savulescu 2008: 279) \nWhile this response suggests some greater flexibility in their view\nthan might be apparent from the language of PPB, they do not always\nseem consistent in advocating for this flexibility. How will\nwe know when different forms of life are equally good or when\nthe associated well-being is incomparable? The fact that some cases\nwill be very clear can be handled by the regulatory structure of a\nphilosophical position that sets a relatively low bar; the space\nbetween ruling out selection for traits that clearly cause pain and\nsuffering, for instance, and demanding those that create the\n“best”, is vast. \n\nRather than giving a substantive account of well-being (and offering a\nprima facie list of rankings), Kahane and Savulescu imply only that we\nwill be able to find an agreeable one. They offer simple examples to\nillustrate their view. Mild asthma, though only a minor impediment to\nwell-being, is nonetheless not acceptable to choose if we have the\ninformation, and an alternative without the mild asthma. Deafness is\nclearly a detriment to well-being—at least in this\nsociety—and so should not be selected. They are careful to add\nthat their view can appreciate deafness, and recognize that it is\nclearly compatible with a good, even flourishing life. But a\nlife without asthma or deafness, they submit, would clearly be better.\nOur obligation is to produce the best, not just a life compatible with\nflourishing. So they see the need for two steps: finding a reasonable\ntheoretical model of well-being, and then investigating whether a\nparticular trait or condition is, on balance, a detriment to overall\nwell-being on that view (2008: 288). \n\nDespite their confidence, we have reason to think there will be\nsignificant disagreement in both steps. A theory of well-being that is\nacceptable to most might be so abstract as to not offer significant\nhelp, and then the matter of determining how traits or conditions in\nquestion are related to expected well-being—such that we can do\na comparison and select the best—will be even more difficult\n(Parker 2007). Parents who see value in a wide variety of ways of\nbeing in the world—both for the individual, and for society as a\nwhole—may welcome children who have traits that are not\nstandardly considered advantageous. (Consider positive accounts about\nraising children with Down syndrome, Berube 1998 and Estreich 2011,\nand even profound cognitive and physical disability, Kittay 1999).\nWelcoming such children who are “naturally” produced might\nbe different from engineering them to be so, but Kahane and Savulescu\ngo a step further. They admit that women need not undergo IVF\ntreatment just for relatively negligible improvements in the life\nprospects of their future children, but   we believe that PB instructs women to seriously\nconsider IVF if natural reproduction is likely to lead to a child with\na condition that is expected to reduce well-being significantly, even\nif that condition is not a disease. This is clearest if natural\nreproduction is likely to result in a child disposed to, say, clinical\ndepression or autism. But we believe that reproducers also have strong\nreasons to seek to prevent even an innate tendency to negative affect,\nor the severe impairment in social skills associated with Asperger's\nsyndrome. (2008: 281) \nThe moral obligation to produce the best child one can, then, can\ninclude an obligation to take on the risks and impositions of\nIVF. \n\nOne worry regarding the obligation to produce the best\nchild—particularly the best child in a particular\nsociety—is that unjust societal norms will then exert their\nforce even more strongly. The “most advantaged” child in a\nsexist society is likely to be a boy. If the society is also racist\nand homophobic, that boy will be light skinned and heterosexual (see\nSparrow 2011a). Interestingly, Kahane and Savulescu stand by\nPPB—there is a moral obligation to produce the best\nchild, who would, in this case, be a light-skinned heterosexual\nboy—but they note that we have other moral reasons that outweigh\nthe moral reasons offered by PPB in this case.   Parents shouldn't choose the fair skinned child\nbecause of the expected prejudice. It's better to change pernicious\nattitudes than to reinforce them through capitulation. (2008:\n290) \n\nHow would we change the attitudes? Perhaps by education and\nanti-discrimination laws for existing people. For Kahane and\nSavulescu, it doesn't make sense to restrict access to genetic\ninterventions regarding sex, sexuality or skin color, in order to\nensure no such capitulation to these unjust norms. In his earlier\npaper, Savulescu (2001) notes that in a sexist society, we have to\naddress the unfair treatment of women, but it doesn't make sense to do\nthat through regulation of reproductive decision-making.   Reproduction should not become an instrument of social\nchange, at least not mediated or motivated at a social level. This\nalso illustrates why Procreative Beneficence is different to\neugenics. Eugenics is selective breeding to produce a better\npopulation. A public interest justification for interfering in\nreproduction is different from Procreative Beneficence, which aims at\nproducing the best child, of the possible children, a couple could\nhave. That is an essentially private enterprise. (2001:\n424) \n\nBuchanan (2011) is broadly optimistic about biomedical enhancement\ntechnologies—seeing them as not significantly unlike other\nenhancing societal innovations, such as literacy, numeracy and\nagriculture— and argues in favor of funding research and\ndevelopment into a broad array of enhancements. While he mainly argues\nagainst conservative critics of bioenhancement (e.g,. Kass 2003;\nSandel 2007; Fukuyama 2003), he also considers the likelihood of a\nshift from individual to social justifications of enhancement\ninterventions. If biomedical enhancements that improve individual\nwell-being become available, governments may rightly be interested in\nfunding enhancements and perhaps even making them mandatory (2011:\n128), because doing so will be socially good: good for economic growth\nto avoid problems of illiteracy, sickness, etc. that can accompany,\nfor instance, lower intelligence and merely typical immune systems.\nBuchanan recommends the creation of a Global Institute for Justice in\nInnovation (2011: 255) in order to ensure that such benefits would be\nmade more widely available, given that some individuals and\ngovernments would not otherwise be able to afford them. He recognizes\nthat the social justification for enhancement, with the possibility of\nmandatory participation, starts to sound surprisingly like past\neugenic policies, but he seems to think they are different, at least\nin part because individuals should benefit as well. Indeed, he\nexplicitly states  To justify encouraging or even requiring biomedical\nenhancements, governments wouldn't have to resurrect the bad science\nand bizarre master-race theories that warped eugenic thinking.  They\nwould only have to appeal to the same reasons we all invoke when we\njustify public education, health insurance, public health measures\nlike vaccination, and policies designed to help American business be\nmore competitive in a global economy. (2011: 124) \nIf we think it makes sense to support these programs, the implication\nis that we ought to support genetic enhancements as well. The result\nmight be mandatory enhancement for your own good—and that of\nsociety. \n\nOther theorists likewise offer social benefit justifications for\ngenetic enhancement. Elster (2011) advocates a principle of general\nprocreative beneficence, changing the last part of Savulescu's PPB to\nan obligation to produce the best child, of those possible,\n“whose life will maximize the expected overall value in the\nworld.” (2011: 483). Rather than focus on individual welfare, he\nrecommends a system of obligations that starts from general social\ngoods. Parents considering reproduction are then bound by a maximizing\nduty to the world. \n\nAlthough Savulescu highlights the well-being of the individual in his\nwork on PPB, in more recent work, the obligation to produce the best\nseems to have shifted from an obligation to improve the world by\nprivately producing the best individuals, to an obligation to improve\nthe world by producing individuals who will help to solve social\nproblems. For instance, he argues with Persson (Persson and Savulescu\n2012) that we are obligated to fund and explore moral\nbioenhancement (2012: 2)—the idea that we could genetically\nor pharmacologically enhance our moral motivation, to reduce\nselfishness and aggression, and increase our sense of fairness,\naltruism, and our willingness to cooperate (see also Douglas\n2008). Given the massive threats to human well-being presented by\nglobal climate change and the abundance of weapons of mass\ndestruction—and the fact that solutions to these large scale\nproblems will require collective action to prevent future\nproblems—Persson and Savulescu claim that traditional methods of\nmoral change (e.g., education, public campaigns) will be unlikely to\nbe effective. If we care to save the planet—and we\nshould—then we are obligated to invest in moral bioenhancement\nresearch, and presumably ensure that if successful, it gets wide\nuptake (Persson and Savulescu 2012). Buchanan (2011) is sympathetic,\nnoting that critics who worry about whether we will use this\ntechnology wisely may be short-sighted:   [I]f you think we should avoid enhancements because\nyou think our present character is so flawed that we are bound to\nmisuse them, you're assuming that our character is fixed. It may not\nbe. (2011: 171) \nThis suggestion about moral bioenhancement has sparked\ncriticism focused on threats to human freedom (Harris 2011; Simkulet\n2013), the meaning of being virtuous (Kabasenche 2013), and the\ncomplexity of human moral psychology (Zarpentine 2011). \n\nCritics of the argument regarding moral obligations to enhance are\nhighly skeptical of the claim that such arguments can escape the\ncharge of being problematically eugenic. Bennett (2008) notes:   [F]or all this well-meaning talk of liberalism and\nfreedom, an obligation to bring to birth the best children possible\narguably entails very “unliberal” notions and\nconsequences. I argue that this obligation can only be established by\nplacing a lower moral value on those with disabilities or otherwise\nimpaired lives and, if accepted, this obligation, produces a strong\nargument in favour not only of infringing individual reproductive\nautonomy but also of introducing eugenic policies. (2008:\n270)  \nSparrow (2011a) is also sharply critical:  Only through a very particular and not especially\nplausible negotiation of the uneasy relationship between their moral\ntheory and their policy prescriptions can Harris and Savulescu obscure\nthe fact that the gap between the new and the old eugenics is not that\nlarge at all…[with] implications that most people would find\nprofoundly unattractive. (2011a: 33) \nKoch (2011) highlights similarities to past eugenic policies and\naccuses the central theorists of hubris—even a “huckster's\npromise” (p. 199)—in presuming not only that we will be\nable to engineer complex traits like intelligence, but that they can\nknow the appropriate regulatory limits and speak for all parents. The\ntitle of Persson and Savulescu's book—Unfit for Life\n(2012)—combined with its thesis regarding the need for tightened\ncontrols on liberal societies in order to preserve human security,\nmakes unavoidable comparisons to the Nazi idea of lives unworthy of\nlife. (For a chilling review of Savulescu's recent work, see\nMunsterhjelm 2011.) \n\nCriticisms of the trend toward advocating liberal\neugenics—whether regarding permission or obligation—come\nfrom a variety of corners. Disability rights advocates highlight the\nproblematic conceptions of disability that underlie many of the\narguments as well as the negative effects liberal eugenics is likely\nto have on existing people with disabilities (Asch 1999; Saxton 2000;\nAmundson 2005). Other theorists—attentive to the pervasive\nunjust discrimination in respect to sexism, racism, classism, and\nheterosexism—emphasize the broadly negative consequences of\npromoting or allowing liberal eugenics policies, given the aggregation\nof many individual choices, and the slippery slope to an older style\nof coercive eugenics (Duster 1990; De Melo Martin 2004; Sparrow\n2011a).  Some highlight potential damage to the parent-child\nrelationship in a world where particular features of children are\nchosen, fearing both a loss of openness to the unbidden and of\nunconditional love (Sandel 2007). When parents attempt to design their\nchildren, critics argue, they demonstrate a lack of humility in the\nface of nature, and more specifically, an attempt to control where\nthey should instead appreciate novelty (Kass 2003).  \n\nThe disability right critique of the “new” eugenics takes\non current practices such as prenatal testing and selective abortion,\nas well as futuristic options such as enhancement and design.\n  \n\nIn what is known as the expressivist argument, disability\ntheorists have argued that prenatal testing followed by selective\nabortion sends a negative message—“It is better not to\nexist than to have a disability” (Saxton 2000), “We do not\nwant any more like you” (Wendell\n1996)—to\nexisting people with disabilities, particularly those living with\ndisabilities for which testing is routinely done. The negative message\nis harmful and might be considered a form of discrimination. The\nexpressivist argument is often defended by theorists who are staunchly\npro-choice about abortion; they typically defend a woman's legal right\nto choose abortion for any reason, but present a moral argument\nagainst particular reasons for abortion. In making this distinction,\nthey rely on the “any/particular” distinction proposed by\nAsch (2000); a woman who does not want any child because she\nis not ready to be a mother is different from one who is eager to be a\nmother but then rejects this particular fetus, based on prenatal\ntesting. A different version of the expressivist argument looks beyond\nthe individual act of testing to focus on the social offer of\nprenatal testing, particularly in a society where it has become\nroutinized, to consider the negative evaluation it expresses about the\nlives of existing people with disabilities (Press 2000). \n\nObjections have been raised regarding the meaning of such\n“expressions” (see, for instance, Buchanan 1996; Nelson\n2000), and the necessity of the message (Baily\n2000; McMahan\n2005), as well as the relative moral significance of the message even\nif it is negative and expressed (Edwards 2004). Many theorists\nemphasize that one can value the person with a disability, while\ndevaluing the disability (Savulescu 2001; Glover 2006; McMahan\n2005). Glover, for instance, is careful to note that we should be very\nclear about expressing support for existing people with disabilities\neven as we seek prenatal testing or other genetic interventions:   [W]e need to send a clear signal that we do not have\nthe ugly attitudes about disability. It is important to show that what\nwe care about is our children's flourishing: that this, and not\nshrinking from certain kinds of people, or some horrible project of\ncleansing the world of them, is what motivates us. To think that a\nparticular disability makes someone's life less good is not one of the\nugly attitudes. It does not mean that the person who has it is of any\nless value, or is less deserving of respect, than anyone else. (2006:\n35) \nThat distinction however, can be difficult to accept for individuals\nwho experience their disability as a central part of their identity\n(for discussion, see Wendell 1996; Saxton 2000; Edwards 2004). Furthermore, as Holm\n(2007) notes, even if we could conceptually separate prenatal testing\nfrom the disrespectful and discriminatory messages about people with\ndisabilities, that doesn't mean they aren't deeply intertwined in the\ncurrent practice. \n\nSome disability rights advocates reject the expressivist argument, and\nare more concerned with the fairness and completeness of the\ninformation provided in the context of prenatal testing than in the\npractice as a whole (Shakespeare 2006). On that note, Klein\n(2011) finds\nevidence of “a disregard for disability experience and sustained\nignorance of disability issues” in the attitudes, practices,\neducation and research of professionals involved in administering\nprenatal testing. In sum, the expressivist argument highlights the\nways in which prenatal testing feels threatening to people with\ndisabilities and their allies/advocates. As Parens and Asch point\nout,   If one thinks for even a moment about the history of\nour society's treatment of people with disabilities, it is not\ndifficult to appreciate why people identified with the disability\nrights movement might regard such testing as dangerous. …\nliving with disabling traits need not be detrimental either to an\nindividual's prospects of leading a worthwhile life, or to the\nfamilies in which they grow up, or to society at large. (2000:\n4) \nThe expressivist argument applies equally to the use of\npre-implantation diagnosis, and similar concerns about misperceptions\nregarding potential quality of life for people with disabilities or\nnon-typical modes of functioning apply to the quest for enhancement\ntechnologies as well. \nPart of what concerns disability rights advocates is the questionable\nrelation between the existence of certain impairments or bodily\nanomalies and the availability of equality of opportunity or\nwell-being (Silvers, Wasserman, and Mahowald 1998; Amundson 2005; Asch\nand Wasserman 2005) that seems to be a common presumption in liberal\neugenics theories. Broadly, they worry that many theorists are\nrelatively uninformed about the life experiences of people with\ndisabilities, or unfairly dismissive of their claims (Amundson 2005;\nGoering 2008), and thus rely on an overly negative evaluation of their\nquality of life. As such, efforts to promote “good birth”\nundervalue existing people with disabilities. Additionally, advocates\nof liberal eugenics, it is argued, allow one trait to stand in for all\nof what a potential person can be (Asch and Wasserman 2005), and\nunderestimate the value of human diversity that includes non-standard\nmodes of human functioning linked to disability (Silvers 1998), and\nthe possibility of “gains” made possible through living\nwith disability (Garland-Thomson 2012). (For more discussion, see SEP entries\non disability: definitions, models, experience;\n\nand feminist perspectives on disability.) \n\nOther critics point to potentially troubling assumptions in the\ntheoretical framework of liberal eugenics. Bennett, for instance,\nlooks at whether an appeal to impersonal or non-person-affecting harm\ncan get us out of the non-identity problem without resorting to\ntroubling social justifications for a purportedly individualistic\neugenics. She claims,   What this obligation [for PPB] is built on is an idea\nof making the world a better place than it could otherwise have been,\nnot in terms of any individual person's welfare, but in terms of\ncreating the greatest total score for what is regarded as the goods of\nlife. If a project is not interested in the welfare of particular\npeople but in creating what those proposing this project believe is\nthe best world possible, then this is exactly what eugenics\nis—promoting social and not personal goods. (Bennett 2008:\n272) \nSo, even though advocates of procreative beneficence claim to value\npeople equally (while acknowledging that their lives can go better or\nworse), this does not square with the idea of some worlds\nbeing morally preferable simply because they do not contain\neven mild disabilities. \n\nSparrow (2011a) targets the arguments for an obligation to enhance by\npointing to the “profound tension” between their\nconsequential justifications and assurances about the preservation of\nreproductive liberties. For example, he highlights the fact that in\norder to get out of the problem of colluding with unjust social\nnorms—which he does by admitting that in certain cases parents\nought not choose the “best” child for their social\nenvironment, given sexism, racism, etc.—Savulescu must revert to\nattending to social consequences, rather than individual welfare.\nLiberal eugenics is supposed to be about promoting individual\nwell-being.   As soon as we begin sacrificing the well-being of\nindividuals for the sake of social goals, such as diversity, we are\nfirmly back in the territory of old eugenics. (2011a:\n35–36) \nSparrow also questions the justification for the assumption that\nparents ought to have the best child they could have. If we\nare morally obligated to produce the best, and if any embryos we can\nproduce are not likely to rank very high relative to those of others,\nwouldn't there also be an obligation to use a donated embryo (or a\nclone of the embryo that is the best) (Sparrow\n2011a)? To be fair, Savulescu argues that other moral reasons can\ntrump the PPB, and some degree of reproductive autonomy will surely\nfit there. Sparrow limits his criticism to what we are apparently\nmorally obligated to do under the PPB, pointing to the odd\nconsequences of the maximizing feature of the principle. Finally,\nSparrow suggests that even if advocates of an obligation to\nenhance—like Savulescu and Harris—deny any requirement for\nthe government to coerce individuals to participate in genetic\ninterventions for the sake of enhancement, governments might be\nobligated to implement policies that are not strictly coercive, e.g.,\nsystems of incentives and targeted health campaigns. Doing so would be\na form of state-sponsored control—even if only through\nnon-coercive pressure—of reproduction, and thus much more like\ntroubling old-style eugenics.  \n\nA further concern about the general framing of the “best\nchild” obligation regards the possibility of creating a clear\nranked list of traits. To identify the best possible child with the\nbest possible chance at life one must not simply have a general view\nof traits that can make life go well or poorly. Rather, one must be\nable to rank collections of such traits in relation to their\ncapacity to bring about the best possible life. The limited\ninformation we get from prenatal testing or preimplantation diagnosis\ncould incline parents toward particular choices, but would be\nunderdetermining for identifying the best possible\nchild. Parker notes that   [C]omplex concepts, such as those of the good life,\nthe best life, and human flourishing, are not reducible to simple\nelements or constituent parts which might be identified through the\ntesting of embryos. (Parker 2007: 281) \nFurther, given the diversity of preferences for different combinations\nof traits and beliefs about how they relate to the likelihood of a\ngood life—given differing conceptions of the good life—it\nis difficult to envision how rationality could point us to only one\nbest possible child. Even if many circumstances produce a variety of\nequally good possible options, as Savulescu suggests, identifying what\nmakes that set of options equally good is not clear. Parker takes this\nobjection to show that while parents might have an obligation to\nconsider whether a child they bring into existence will have a\nreasonable chance at a good life, it does not require them to produce\nthe best possible child. \n\nA third variety of critic highlights what might be called the\ntroubling aggregate effect of individual choices, particularly when\nthey are often ill-informed or relatively biased (De Melo Martin 2004;\nGoering 2000). Such theorists need not be against all forms of\nenhancement, but they emphasize the need for strict regulation given\nthe deeply entrenched social injustices that pervade many societies,\nand that would typically inform individual free choices. Tremain\n(2006) discusses this effect in relation to disability. Russell (2010)\nargues that taking race to be a morally neutral feature (as Harris\ndoes) is only a “veiled attempt” to distinguish\ncontemporary from historical eugenics practices. Perhaps race should\nbe morally neutral, but it is not commonly treated as such, and\nopening up “choice” for people who harbor explicit or\nimplicit biases related to race allows for those biases to shape the\nnext generation.  Oliver (2010) likewise highlights the trick of\nlabeling gender a morally neutral category in a world filled with\nsexism, and also rightly emphasizes the levels of surveillance and\ncontrol over women that are likely to follow the implementation of\nliberal eugenics. The unintended negative effects on pregnant women of\nincreased attention to prenatal testing and surveillance of pregnancy\ngenerally are explored in Katz Rothman (1986), Rapp (1999), and Kukla\n(2008), but tend not to be widely discussed by liberal eugenics\nadvocates (see Oliver 2010).  (See also SEP entry\non pregnancy, birth and medicine.) \n\nSparrow (2011b) suggests that the advocate of liberal eugenics faces a\ndilemma: if parents should be the ones determining future well-being\nof children, then they will likely choose in ways that a) some\nliberals find counter-intuitive, as with Deaf kids, and b) may,\nthrough market pressures and social norms, lead to homogeneity from\n“tyranny of the majority” (2011b: 515); if, however,\nparents should not have this leeway, then we end up putting decisions\nabout enhancements in the hands of the state, and then\n“new” eugenics looks a lot like old eugenics, with all its\nattendant concerns. While most advocates of liberal eugenics express\nconcern about the problem of aggregate effects of individual choices,\nthey often end up seeming to dismiss them (Green 2007), presuming that\neducation or other modes of dealing with the problems will be\nsufficient (Savulescu 2001), or just adding a qualification about the\nneed to avoid reinforcing unjust social norms (Agar 2004), without\nfully exploring the difficulty of doing so. \n\nStill other critics (Sandel 2007; Kass 2003) highlight the ways in\nwhich the motivations for the enhancement project express hubris, a\n“drive to mastery” (Sandel 2007: 27) that, left unchecked,\nthreatens to alter the nature and meaning of parent-child\nrelationships, from openness to the “unbidden” and\nunconditional love to design and manufacture (Kass 2003). As Sandel\nputs it, “the deepest moral objection to enhancement lies less\nin the perfection it seeks, than in the human disposition it expresses\nand promotes” (2007: 46). \n\nThe problem with a drive to mastery, for Sandel, is that we think we\ncan (and should) control everything, and in so doing, we fail to\nappreciate the “gifted character of human powers and\nachievements” (2007: 29). To appreciate our giftedness, he says,\nwe must understand that our abilities are not “wholly of our own\ndoing, nor even fully ours” (2007: 27). We recognize, in other\nwords, how indebted we are to good luck, and how we and others may be\nunfortunate, rather than simply irresponsible. In so doing, we remain\nhumble, and we build solidarity with other people through recognition\nof our shared situation. If we lose that appreciation for giftedness,\nas he thinks we will by employing enhancement technologies that create\nprecise expectations about how our children will be, we may lose\nimportant human goods (humility, reasonable responsibility,\nsolidarity). Even though we might undertake enhancement for the\nbenefit of our offspring, in so doing, we make them into creatures who\nmust be indebted to us for their gifts, and for whom our love may be\nconditional on fulfilling our intentions. Sandel recognizes that many\nparents already exert excessive influence on their children's lives,\nand may fail to love them unconditionally, but he worries that genetic\nenhancement technologies will only exasperate that tendency. If a\nparent designs a child to be a certain way, her investment will\nincrease her demands. In a similar vein, Kass notes that parental\nhopes will become parental expectations if we allow the designing of\nchildren (Kass 2003). The concern about parental expectations,\nprenatal testing, and how choice might affect the unconditional love\nwe envision for parents is also explored by disability scholars\n(Kittay and Kittay 2000; Asch and Wasserman 2005).  One difficulty with these arguments is that much of what we\nattempt to do in medicine to create treatments for disease could\nitself fit under a “drive to mastery” and might likewise\nquestion our commitment to being “open to the unbidden”\n(see Buchanan 2011). Also, if the point is simply that we must be\nattentive to our inclinations to hubris—we might get carried\naway in thinking we can enhance appropriately—then we could heed\nthat warning without rejecting the enhancement project entirely. Other\ncritics simply deny the value of humility (Glover 2006: 113). \n\nKamm (2005) dismisses Sandel's worries about mastery and openness to\nthe unbidden, but she raises a different kind of worry about the\nenhancement project (one related to the worry about aggregate effects\nof individual choice). Her fear is that we may “lack\nimagination” to see how a variety of traits (and different\ncombinations of traits) can create goods we have yet to envision or\nexperience.   [W]hen creatures of limited imagination do not design\nthemselves and others, they are likely to extend the range of their\nappreciation of goods because the range of goods is likely to be\nlarger. A parent who might have designed his child to have the good\ntrait of composing classical music, could not have conceived that it\nwould be good to have a child who turns out to be one of the Beatles.\n(To have conceived it, would have involved creating the style before\nthe Beatles did.) …[T]oo much control will limit the number and\ncombination of goods from what is possible. (Kamm 2005:\n14) \n Figuring out how to heed these warnings based on hubris and\n mastery—what they mean for the enhancement project—is not\n at all clear. \n\nAnother worry linked to the desire for control comes from Habermas\n(2003) who grounds his arguments in a deontological framework. He\nargues that by engineering our children in very specific\nways—beyond the treatment of disease—we may undermine\ntheir capacity for self-definition, their sense of being responsible\nfor themselves (in respect to creating their own identities), and\ntheir freedom (2003: 12–13). He claims that it is not genetic\nengineering per se that is the problem, but rather the   mode and scope of its use….[and] moreover\nthe attitude in which interventions in the genetic makeup of\nmembers of our moral community are carried out that provides the\nstandards for an assessment of their admissibility. (2003:\n43) \nIn this case, the wrong attitude is one that is not attentive to\nlikely second person consent to the changes—would the child have\ngranted approval for the selected traits? For Habermas, what matters\nis the attitude of appreciating the need for the future person's\npresumed consent, rather than the idea of making the change merely\naccording to parental preferences.  Further, he worries that parents\nwho engineer their children will have expectations of their children\n“without, however, providing the addressee [the child] with an\nopportunity to take a revisionist stand” (2003:\n51). Why not?   The genetic program is a mute, and in a sense,\nunanswerable fact; for unlike persons born naturally, someone who is\nat odds with genetically fixed intentions is barred from developing,\nin the course of a reflectively appropriated and deliberately\ncontinued life history, an attitude toward her talents (and handicaps)\nwhich implies a revised self-understanding and allows for\na productive response to the initial situation. (2003:\n62) \nThe basis for this claim seems to rest on a distinction between\n“the grown and the made” p. 52—being created to be a\nparticular way is being made, and so objectified, a product\nof the parents. Being grown, by contrast, recognizes the individual\nsubjectivity of the new person, who is equal to her parents and not\ndefined by them. This objection shares much with Kass's concerns about\ngenetic despotism—control of one generation by the previous one\n(2003). \n\nAs many critics (Buchanan 2011; Glover 2006; Green 2007) point out,\nthough, it is unclear why the genetically designed child could\nnot be revisionist in her response to her parents. Designing\na child to have features that make, for example, an athletic career\npossible (even likely) is not the same as ensuring such a career, or\neven an athletic body. Parenting would not lose its challenges simply\nbecause of the origins of the features of the child in question.\nHowever, perhaps there are some morally relevant differences in the\nmeans parents take to try to shape their children, such that the\nlonger iterative process of educating a child enforces a kind of\ncommunicative engagement that simply cannot be part of engineering an\nembryo, and that negatively affects the parent-child relationship\n(Malmqvist 2011).  Of course, as Hayry notes, deciding not to\nenhance a child is also a decision that would seem to require consent\nfrom the future child, and we surely do not want to insist that the\nonly way to respect future generations is not to produce them at all\n(Hayry 2010: 42).","contact.mail":"sgoering@uw.edu","contact.domain":"uw.edu"}]
