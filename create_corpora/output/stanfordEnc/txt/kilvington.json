Along with Walter Burley and Thomas Bradwardine, he\nrepresented the first academic generation of the school of Oxford\nCalculators. Although he brought new ideas and methods into logic,\nnatural philosophy, and theology, and influenced his contemporaries\nand followers, he has been little studied until recently.\n\nRichard Kilvington (we know almost seventy different spellings of his\nname) was born at the beginning of the fourteenth century in the\nvillage of Kilvington, Yorkshire. He was the son of a priest from the\ndiocese of York. He studied at Oxford, where he became Master of Arts\n(1324/25) then Doctor of Theology (ca. 1335) (for bibliographical\ndetails, see Kretzmann and Kretzmann 1990b, Jung-Palczewska 2000b).\nHis academic career was followed by a diplomatic and an ecclesiastical\none, working in the service of Edward III and taking part in\ndiplomatic missions. His career culminated in his appointment as Dean\nof St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. Along with Richard Fitzralph,\nKilvington was involved in the battle against the mendicant friars, an\nargument that continued almost until his death in 1361. \nOther than a few sermons, all of Kilvington’s known works stem\nfrom his lectures at Oxford. None is written in the usual commentary\nfashion, following the order of books in the respective works of\nAristotle. In accordance with the fourteenth-century Oxford practice,\nthe number of topics discussed was reduced to certain central issues,\nwhich were fully developed with no more than ten questions in each\nset. The reduction in the range of topics is counterbalanced by deeper\nanalysis in the questions chosen for treatment. Some of\nKilvington’s questions cover fifteen folios, which in a modern\nedition yield about 120 pages. His philosophical works, the\nSophismata and Quaestiones super De generatione et\ncorruptione, composed before 1325, came from his lectures as a\nBachelor of Arts; the Quaestiones super Physicam (1325/26)\nand Quaestiones super Libros Ethicorum (1326/32) date from\nhis time as an Arts Master; after he advanced to the Faculty of\nTheology, he produced ten questions on Peter Lombard’s\nSentences, composed before 1334. Of these works, only the\nSophismata has been edited, translated, and studied in full\n(see Kretzmann and Kretzmann 1990a-b; for the titles of other\nquestions and their manuscripts, see Jung-Palczewska 2000b). \nLike many other English thinkers, Kilvington was a leader in three\nmain disciplines: terminist logic, mathematical physics, and the new\ntheology. Methods and insights developed in the first two disciplines\nwere used in the third. The application of the terminist logic and the\nrefutation of the Aristotelian prohibition against metabasis\nresulted in Kilvington’s broad use of logic and mathematics in\nall branches of scientific inquiry to emphasize certitude in knowledge\nand bring into play four types of measurement. The predominant form of\nmeasurement by limit, i.e., by the beginning and ending of successive\nor permanent things (incipit/desinit), by the first and last\ninstants of the beginning and ending of continuous processes (de\nprimo et ultimo instanti), and by the intrinsic and extrinsic\nlimits of capacities of passive and active potencies (de maximo et\nminimo), does not appear to be straightforwardly mathematical,\nthough it raises mathematical considerations insofar as it prescribes\nmeasure for natural processes. The second type of measurement, by\nlatitude of forms, describes processes in which accidental forms or\nqualities are intensified or diminished in terms of the distribution\nof natural qualities such as heat or whiteness or moral qualities such\nas love, grace, sin, will, or desire. In his measurement of the\nintension and remission of forms, Kilvington is interested in\ndetermining how the highest degree of a quality can be introduced into\na subject already possessing the same quality to a certain degree by\nundergoing an alteration, and consequently in establishing the\npossibility of a most intense or diminished degree of, e.g., heat and\ncold, or virtue and vice. The third type of measurement, the strictly\nmathematical, employs a new calculus of compounding ratios to measure\nspeed in local motion or speed in the distribution of love. Finally,\nthe fourth type of measurement describes a ‘rule’\npermitting the comparison of infinities, treated as infinite sets\ncontaining infinite subsets, and determining which of them is equal,\nless, or greater. \nKilvington employs all types of measurement to describe events both\nreal and imaginable. Having adopted Ockham’s ontological\nminimalism, Kilvington claims that absolutes, i.e., substances and\nqualities, are the only subjects that can be changed. Therefore, no\nterm used to describe change, such as motion, time,\nlatitude, and degree has any representation in\nreality. Thus, he contrasts things that are really distinct with\nthings distinguishable only in reason, i.e., in the imagination.\nImaginary cases are descriptions of hypothetical situations. The\nelements of the description and not the situation itself are, in fact,\nof primary concern for Kilvington. He is interested in the coherence\nof a theory that describes all imaginable cases and not in one that\ndescribes only observable phenomena; to be imaginable means to be\npossible, i.e., not to generate a contradiction. Everything imaginable\nmust be logically possible within a natural framework. Therefore,\nalthough we can imagine a void and formulate rules of motion in it, we\ncan only say that a void might have existed if created by God’s\nabsolute power, though it does not actually exist anywhere in the\nuniverse. \nThere are four levels in Kilvington’s secundum\nimaginationem analyses. These levels may be classified according\nto their increasing abstraction and decreasing probability. On the\nfirst level, there are imaginary cases which are potentially\nobservable and which might occur in nature, such as Socrates’\nbecoming white. On the second level are imaginary cases which cannot\nbe observed, even though they belong to the natural order. These cases\nillustrate the necessary consequences of the application of rules\nproperly describing natural phenomena—the best example being\nEarth’s rectilinear motion, which is caused by its desire to\nunite the center of gravity with its own center. On the third level\nare cases not observable but theoretically possible, such as reaching\ninfinite speed in an instant. The fourth level concerns cases that are\nonly theoretically possible. Kilvington uses the last two groups of\nimaginable, i.e., hypothetical cases to reveal inconsistencies in\nreceived theories, especially from Aristotle, demonstrating\nmathematically the paradoxes that arise from Aristotle’s laws of\nmotion. If hypothetical cases do not involve contradiction, there is\nno reason to reject them or exclude them from the realm of\nspeculation. \nKilvington’s secundum imaginationem analyses go\ntogether with his ceteris paribus method: he assumes that all\ncircumstances in the case being considered are the same, and that only\none factor, which changes during the process, causes changes in the\nresults. \nKilvington’s Sophismata, written before 1325, is his\nonly logical work. A sophisma or sophism is neither a\nstandard paradox of disputation nor a sophistical argument but a\nstatement the truth of which is in question. The first sophism\nKilvington discusses typifies the basic structure: a statement of the\nsophism sentence followed by a case or hypothesis, arguments for and\nagainst the sophism sentence, the resolution of the sophism sentence\nand reply to the arguments on the opposing side, ending with an\nintroduction to the next sophism sentence. \nKilvington’s sophisms are meant to be of logical interest, but\nthey also pose important questions in physics or natural philosophy.\nIn constructing his sophisms, Kilvington sometimes makes use of\nobservable physical motion and at other times appeals to imaginable\ncases that have no reference to outside reality. Although the latter\ncases are impossible physically, they are theoretically possible,\ni.e., they do not involve a formal contradiction. At one point he\nwrites: \nEven though the hypothesis supposed there is impossible in\nfact…it is nevertheless possible per se; and for purposes of\nthe sophism, that is enough. \n[unde licet casus idem positus sit impossibilis de\nfacto…tamen per se possibilis est; et hoc sufficit pro\nsophismate] (S29: 69; tr. Kretzmann and Kretzmann 1990b:\n249). \nThe first eleven sophisms deal with the process of whitening, in which\nthe motion of alteration is conceived as a successive entity\nextrinsically limited at its beginning and end. There is no first\ninstant of alteration, claims Kilvington, but only a last instant\nbefore the alteration begins; likewise, there is no last instant of\nalteration, but only the first instant at which the final degree has\nbeen introduced. There is no minimum degree of whiteness or speed\ngained in motion, but rather smaller and smaller degrees ad infinitum\ndown to zero, since the qualities change continuously. Integers are\npotentially infinite because one can always find a higher integer, but\nnot actually infinite since there is no single infinite number. In\nKilvington’s view, since any continuity—e.g., time, space,\nmotion, heat, whiteness—is infinitely divisible, it can be\nspoken of quantitatively and measured in terms of infinite sets of\nintegers. The subjects of sophisms 29–44 reveal\nKilvington’s special interest in local motion with respect to\ncauses, i.e., active and passive potencies, and effects, i.e., time,\ndistance traversed, and speed in motion. He considers both uniform and\ndifform motion caused by voluntary agents and points out the\nquestionable measure of instantaneous speed through the comparison of\nspeed in uniform and accelerated motion (see Kretzmann 1982) \nThe last four sophisms are ostensibly connected with epistemology and\nthe logic of knowledge, i.e., sentences on knowing and doubting\ninvolving intentional contexts, such as S45: “You know this to\nbe everything that is this”. The most interesting among them is\nS47, “You know that the king is seated”, where Kilvington\ncalls some rules of obligational disputation into question (see\nKretzmann and Kretzmann 1990: 330—47; d’Ors 1991). In the\nopinion of Stump, “what Kilvington has done in his work on S47,\nby his change in the rule for irrelevant propositions, is to shift the\nwhole purpose of obligations” (Stump 1982: 332). \nAlthough, Kilvington does not enjoy the reputation in natural\nphilosophy that he does in logic, recent research reveal that his\nquestions on Aristotle’s De generatione et corruptione\nand Physics inspired Thomas Bradwardine’s theory of\nmotion and his famous rule of velocities in motion (see\nJung-[Palczewska] 2000b; Jung 2002a; 2002b). Both works stemmed from\nlectures Kilvington delivered in the Arts Faculty before 1328, i.e.,\nbefore Bradwardine’s treatise On the Proportion or\nProportions of Velocities in Motions. \nLike most medieval natural philosophers, Kilvington accepts\nAristotle’s general rules of motion: \nWhile accepting substance and quality as the only two absolute\nrealities, Kilvington states that the reality of motion is limited to\nwhat is in motion: the places, qualities, and quantities it\nsuccessively acquires. Consequently, he is more interested in\nmeasuring local motion in terms of the actions of the causes of\nmotion, the distance traversed, and the time consumed, than in the\nintensity of speed. In his commentaries on De generatione et\ncorruptione and the Physics, Kilvington tries to\nformulate the differences between generation, alteration, and\naugmentation; determine rules for actions that are causes of change;\nfind rules for the division of different types of continua;\nand find a mathematically coherent rule of motion. He considers the\nproblem of the motion of two angels with regard to its causes and\neffects in several ways: how is their power to be bounded if it is\nactive or passive? Is it subject to weakening? Is it mutable or\nimmutable? How do we determine the boundaries of an active potency if\na body moves in a medium that is uniformly resistant or not uniformly\nresistant? \nKilvington’s discussion of the measure of motion with respect to\ncauses, or what we would call his ‘dynamic’ analysis, has\na physical aspect involving relations between forces and resistances,\nand a mathematical aspect, involving concepts of continuity and\nlimits. The mathematical character of Kilvington’s theory can be\nseen in his use of two kinds of limit for continuous sequences: an\nintrinsic boundary (when an element is a member of the sequence of\nelements it bounds: maximum quod sic, minimum quod sic) and\nan extrinsic boundary (when an element which serves as a boundary\nstands outside the range of elements which it bounds: maximum quod\nnon, minimum quod non). Although he did not formulate strict\nrules about the different types of division of continua, his\n‘study cases’ reveal that he approved the following\nconditions for the existence of limits: \nAccording to Aristotle (Physics VIII), motion occurs only if\nthe ratio of acting capacity (a force F) to passive capacity (a\nresistance R) is a ratio of major inequality, i.e., when it is\ngreater than 1. Kilvington affirms that every excess of force over\nresistance suffices for motion; thus, whenever force is greater than\nresistance, there is motion. This assumes that force (an active\ncapacity) is bounded by a minimum upon which it cannot act\n(minimum quod non), i.e., by the resistance that is equal to\nit. For a passive capacity of resistance, Kilvington accepts the\nminimum quod sic limit “with respect to\ncircumstances”; he agrees with Aristotle and claims that to\nestablish a passive limit for Socrates’ capacity of vision, we\nshould point to the smallest thing he can see. However, it is not only\nthat we cannot see a small thing, like a grain, but also a large one,\nsuch as a cathedral, if we are close to it. Therefore, passive\ncapacity cannot be described by a minimum quod non limit in\neach case. \nIt seems that Kilvington’s belief in the potential power of\nmathematics also allowed him to formulate a new rule of motion. He\nagrees that the proper way of measuring the speed of motion is to\ndescribe its variations by a double ratio of force (F) and\nresistance (R) as defined by Euclid. Speed of motion thus\nvaries arithmetically whereas the proportion of force to resistance\ndetermining these speeds varies geometrically. Thus, when the\nproportion of force to resistance is squared, the speed will be\ndoubled. Kilvington is aware that the proper understanding of\nEuclid’s definition necessitates a new interpretation of\nAristotle’s rules of motion and concludes that when he is\ntalking about a power moving half of a mobile, Aristotle means\nprecisely the subdouble ratio of F to R, but when he is\ntalking about power moving a mobile twice as heavy, he means the\nsquare of the ratio of F to R. Kilvington’s\nfunction provided values of the ratio of F to R greater\nthat 1:1 for any speed down to zero, since any root of a ratio greater\nthat 1:1 is always a ratio greater that 1:1. He thereby avoids a\nserious weakness in Aristotle’s theory, which cannot explain the\nmathematical relationship of F to R in very slow\nmotion. \nKilvington applies his new rule of motion to describe both natural and\nviolent motion, such as the uniform and difform motions of mixed\nbodies and the motion of simple bodies both in a medium and in a\nvacuum. Reading Kilvington, we must keep in mind that temporal motion\nis possible only if there is some resistance playing the role of a\nvirtus impeditiva. The simplest example is the violent and\nnatural motion of a mixed body in a medium, when the acting power has\nto overcome the external resistance of the medium as well as the\ninternal resistance of an element being moved away from its natural\nplace. The local motion of a simple body in a medium is not\nproblematic either, since it can be explained by its natural desire to\nattain the natural place determined by its heaviness or lightness and\nthe external resistance. Nor does Kilvington have a problem with\nexplaining the natural motion of a mixed body in a vacuum, which is\ncaused by the relative levity and gravity of its elements. Since there\nis no external resistance in a void, only internal resistance can\npermit motion in time. Kilvington here seems to follow Ockham, who\nargued that if a void existed, it would be a place. Since place in the\nAristotelian sense is something natural that has essential qualities,\nit determines the natural motion of elementary bodies and, moreover,\ntheir inclination to remain at rest in their natural place.\nAccordingly, one could imagine a void in four natural spheres, which\nalthough empty preserve the proper qualities characteristic of the\nnatural places of earth, water, air, and fire. Hence, the temporal\nmotion of a mixed body in such a void is the result of the natural\ninclination of heavy or light elements to move to their natural\nplaces. The heaviness and lightness play the roles of force and\nresistance, respectively. Although there would be no external\nresistance in a vacuum, the motion of a mixed body could occur without\nany difficulty. \nKilvington’s most perplexing explanation concerns temporal\nmotion of a simple body in a vacuum. In the opinion of Averroes, a\nsimple body such as a piece of earth has an elementary form, prime\nmatter, and different quantitative parts because it can be divided\ninto parts. Because form cannot resist matter, no resistance can come\nfrom its qualitative parts. But there can be resistance from its\nquantitative parts resisting one another. Kilvington maintains that\nthe temporal motion of a simple body in a vacuum is made possible by\nthe internal resistance that results when the peripheral parts of a\nsimple body offer resistance to the central parts because each part is\nseeking the center. Such an internal resistance produces motion and\ndoes not impede it; nevertheless, it guarantees temporal motion.\nConsequently, if a vacuum existed, the natural motion of a simple body\nwould be possible. Moreover, the speed of such a motion would be the\nfastest, since there is no resistance to be overcome. \nIn the dynamic aspect of motion, when the speed is proportional to the\nF to R ratio, one only determines its value in an\ninstant. Like all later Calculators, Kilvington does not consider\nspeed to be a quality, so there is no real, existential referent for\ninstantaneous speed. Therefore, speed has to be measured by distances,\nlatitudes of quality (formal distance), or quantities traversed, and\nsuch traversals take time unless the speed is infinite. In order to\ncharacterize changes in the speed of motion, one must analyze the\nproblem of local motion in its kinematic aspect. Kilvington’s\ndiscussion of the measure of motion with respect to its effect\nconcentrates on measuring motion by such quantities as distance\ntraversed and time. His attempt to understand the effect of motion as\ncaused by smaller and greater resistances brings him to a distinction,\nalso made by Bradwardine, between the rarity and density of a medium,\nwhich causes motion to be fast or slow, and its extent, determining a\nlonger or shorter time consumed in motion. Kilvington correctly\nrecognizes that to measure the speed of a uniform motion that lasts\nsome time, it is enough to establish relations between time and\ndistance traversed. In his opinion, the same distances traversed in\nequal intervals of time characterize uniform motion. Accelerated\nmotion is described by the same distance traversed in a shorter\ninterval of time, and decelerated motion is characterized by the same\ndistance traversed in a longer time. It is also possible to describe\ndifform motion by, for example, unequal distances traversed in unequal\nintervals of time. \nAlthough Kilvington never abandoned Aristotelian physics, he\nfrequently goes beyond Aristotle’s theories in order to resolve\nthe paradoxes resulting from his laws, creating the impression that\nbehind the facade of Aristotelian principles and terms, Kilvington is\nan Ockhamist. Despite the fact that Kilvington never explicitly\nmentions Ockham, it is beyond doubt that he not only knew the opinions\nof the Venerable Inceptor but also accepted them as a natural way of\nunderstanding the works of the Philosopher. \nThe third Aristotelian work on which Richard Kilvington commented\nduring his regency in the Arts Faculty was the Nicomachean\nEthics. The commentary on the second and tenth books of the\nEthics takes a form of ten questions, which deal only with\nselected issues that were the subjects of Kilvington’s lectures\nat Oxford: e.g., creating and destroying moral virtue, free acts of\nvolition, the behavior of honest people and the delight taken in their\nactions (or conversely, the punishment of those who act evilly), and\nquestions concerning particular virtues such as courage, generosity,\nmagnanimity, justice, and prudence. As Michałowska has shown,\nKilvington uses terminist logic and mathematical physics to solve\nethical problems (see Michałowska 2011, 2016). Michałowska\nalso shows that, just as he did in his questions on the\nPhysics, Kilvington follows Ockham’s minimalist ontology\nby treating ethical qualities—i.e., vices and virtues, cognition\nand wisdom, good and evil—as volition-like objects, calling them\nthe res. Being real things and not merely mental concepts, they\ncan be measured by addition, subtraction, and division into parts, for\nthey undergo change via increase or decrease and so have varying\ndegrees of intensity. Such changes—e.g., undergoing punishment\nfor an evil act—cannot be instantaneous and must happen in time.\nEach change is the result of overcoming resistance by an acting power.\nIn the case of moral acts, the changes do not produce any external\neffects but internal modification in terms of the intensity of virtues\nand vices. When a vice acts upon a virtue, it causes its continuous\nchange, and so a man’s courage can vary in intensity. Virtues\nand vices are opposed in Kilvington’s physical theory, so it is\nimpossible for a man to be vicious and virtuous at the same time,\nalthough it is possible for him to be generous at one time, miserly at\nanother.  \nThe increase or decrease of a moral quality is either an effect of the\nimpact of the opposite quality (or a change in the degree of intensity\nof the same quality), or else the result of human external acts. For\nexample, frequent generous actions towards others leads to an increase\nof generosity. Performing morally good actions intensifies the\nvirtues, whereas the constant practice of evil diminishes them.\nVirtues and vices can be described in terms of different degrees of\nintensity, so one can say that a man can be more or less generous\nduring his lifetime. And just like physical qualities, Kilvington\nstates that the intensity of a moral quality has only an extrinsic\nlimit, so that one cannot perfect one’s virtue infinitely.  \nVirtues and vices have absolute or relative character, and can be\npossessed absolutely (simpliciter) or in a certain respect\n(secundum quid). There are highest—i.e., most\nperfect—degrees of intensity of our moral virtues, but there are\nno absolutely greatest degrees, like Platonic ideas. In\nKilvington’s opinion, a man is never absolutely generous or\nvirtuous. The ultimate perfection, i.e., the highest degree of moral\nvirtue, is the product of a man’s natural dispositions,\nsocializations, and moral acts. But since people relevantly differ,\neach of us is virtuous in our own way. So too, the highest degree of\nmoral virtue is unique in each of us. In Kilvington’s opinion,\nif a man is prudent in the highest degree, he must have all other\nvirtues in the highest degree as well (see Michałowska 2011,\n488–92).  \nFor Kilvington, prudence is one of the primary virtues. It is a habit,\nwhich cooperates with right reason (recta ratio) in the process\nof making good or bad decisions. Even though Ockham is not mentioned\nby name, his theory of the relation between prudence and moral\nknowledge is present in Kilvington’s discussion. Ockham\ndistinguishes two types of moral knowledge. The first, which concerns\nuniversal truths, is gained through learning; the second, which\nconcerns particular statements and particular situations, is gained\nthrough experience. Prudence is understood in two ways: as knowledge\nabout singular propositions and as universal practical knowledge. In\nhis opinion, both types of prudence are gained only through\nexperience, the former concerning singular statements and the latter\nuniversal practical statements. The former is properly called\nprudence, whereas the latter is commonly known as prudence. In\nOckham’s view, the first kind of knowledge—i.e., of\nuniversal truths—must be distinguished from prudence concerning\nsingular statements. The second type of knowledge, however, is the\nsame as prudence, since it is also gained through experience\n(Quaestiones q.6, a.10). Kilvington identifies two kinds of\nmoral knowledge. The first is called scientia necessaria, which\nis composed of general statements and refers to universal truth. The\nother is called scientia ad utrumlibet, which comprises\nparticular statements. The scientia necessaria, achieved by\nmeans of deduction, is not sufficient to make good moral decisions and\nso it must be complemented by a reference to scientia ad\nutrumlibet, achieved by experience (see Michałowska 2016,\n13). Gaining knowledge through experience is an indispensable part\nbecoming prudent. Kilvington states that a man can err with regard to\na moral choice even though he possesses certain and complete knowledge\nabout universal moral truths; a skilled logician is not necessarily a\nmoral person. To make good moral decisions, one needs a\nfully-developed prudence, which is the same as scientia ad\nutrumlibet. Kilvington claims that a man who possesses moral\nknowledge is not automatically prudent, but a prudent man is always\nwise (see Michałowska/Jung 2010, 109–111).  \nGood choices are possible only when the will is supported by prudence.\nThe problem of free will and free choice is fully elaborated in\nKilvington’s Ethics, where he presents his\ntheory—what Michałowska calls a “dynamic\nvoluntarism”. Kilvington distinguishes three types of human\nvolitional acts: willing, nilling, and not-willing. Willing always\nwills, and can never be passive or in potency. Even when the will\nwants nothing (velle nihil), it is willing, and so it cannot\nrest and is always determined to an act of willing. Here Kilvington\nseems to be directly influenced by Scotus, who claims that the will\ncannot be suspended (Ord. I d.1). The will is absolutely free\nin its acts of willing, and the free will of volition is the primary\nprinciple in the genus of contingent propositions. Since the will is\nactive all the time, it must decide between its three acts of volition\n(velle volitionem), nolition (velle nolitionem), or\nnon-velle. With regard to its own internal acts, the will is\nabsolutely free. With regard to its external acts, however, it chooses\nbetween wanting something (velle aliquid) and not wanting\nsomething (nolle aliquid). In these cases, the will is also\nabsolutely free to make such a choice.  \nFor Kilvington it is obvious that prudence plays an essential role in\nproducing good moral acts. When the habit of prudence is not fully\ndeveloped, the will is indecisive. Repeated good moral decisions makes\nit hesitate (non-velle) less, so that the agent is able to\nreach a decision in any context, whether affirmatively velle or\nnegatively nolle. Supported by fully developed prudence, the\nwill makes proper and good moral choices more easily or even\neffortlessly (see Michałowska 2016, 14). Kilvington, however, is\nof the opinion that most of us rarely make good moral decisions\nbecause we often remain in doubt, stuck in the state of\nnon-velle.  \nIn theology, Kilvington applied the new methods of terminist logic and\nmathematical physics to typical fourteenth-century topics such as\nhuman and divine love, fruition, human will and freedom, God’s\nabsolute and ordained power, and divine knowledge of future\ncontingents. Nothing is considered separately from the Creator;\ntherefore, Kilvington relates each human action to God. \nKilvington accepts Scotus’s distinction (Ord. I, d. 44,\nq. u.) between the absolute and ordained power of God. The established\norder of nature is the result of God’s ordained power, but God\ncan also act against this order by his absolute power: \nGod’s power is called ordained insofar as it is a principle for\ndoing something in conformity with a right law with regard to the\nestablished order. God’s power is called absolute insofar as it\nexceeds God’s ordained power, because thanks to it he can act\nagainst the established order. The jurists commonly use the terms\nde facto and de iure, e.g., they say that a king can\ndo de facto anything that is not in accord with ordained\nlaw. \nAlthough Scotus never explicitly says that God’s ordained and\nabsolute power can be considered separately, that is how Kilvington\ninterprets him, as he proceeds to claim that \nThe world’s annihilation would not be less just than its\ncontinued existence, since God’s justice stems from his essence,\nwhich, like his power, is absolute and ordained. There are also\nactual, ‘dependent’ (secundum quid)\ninfinities created by God, such as the intensively infinite capacity\nof the human soul to love, to experience joy, and to suffer. \nLike Scotus, Kilvington is convinced that potentia dei\nabsoluta is a power that really is or can be actualized by God.\nMiracles would be examples of God acting against the natural order.\nIndividual situations also show that God can deviate from laws\nestablished in the natural order, reflecting God’s particular\njudgment. But in his Sentences commentary, there are also\nmany places where Kilvington follows the Ockhamist conception of\nabsolute power in terms of logical possibility, i.e., hypothetical\nsituations that have never become actual. Nevertheless, Kilvington\ncriticizes Ockham (Tractatus contra Benedictum III, 3) when\nhe analyzes hypothetical, imaginary cases (potentia dei\nabsoluta) ruled by logic alone, in which the only principle that\nmust be followed is that of non-contradiction. \nKilvington’s theory of potentia dei absoluta et\nordinata serves to underline the contingency of creation and the\nfreedom of divine will. Here Kilvington abridges Scotus’s\nopinions (Lectura I, dist. 39) and reorders his arguments,\ntaking into account only those most useful for his own theory.\nKilvington formulates nine conclusions in order to ‘save the\nphenomena’ and emphasize God’s absolute freedom of choice.\nHe claims that God’s knowledge, existence, and will are the same\nas God’s essence. However, with regard to God’s absolute\nknowledge, assertoric statements about the past and present and\ncontingent statements about the future have the same certitude since\nthey are absolutely necessary, whereas with regard to the God’s\nordained knowledge, they have only ordained necessity. Everything\nrevealed absolutely by God happens necessarily with absolute\nnecessity, because otherwise he could make himself incapable of\npicking up a stick, and this is a contradiction. Everything revealed\nby God’s ordained power—e.g., articles of\nfaith—depends on God’s will and could be changed. Once\nrevealed, however, they would have ordained necessity, and so they\nwould form a new law. Everything that does not depend on God’s\nfree will comes with ordained necessity, but nothing that depends on\nGod’s free choice is absolutely revealed by God’s ordained\npower. If something is revealed absolutely, it is absolutely credible,\nbecause such a revelation derives from ordained necessity. If\nsomething is revealed under conditions, it is certain only with regard\nto those conditions. \nKilvington’s affinity to Scotus may also be seen in his\nconception of future contingents. He is in agreement with Scotus\n(Lectura I, dist. 39, qq. 1–5) in saying that only an\ninstant in time is present since only ‘now’ exists.\nTherefore, Aquinas’s analogy to God sitting at the center of a\ncircle and being present with all time fails, whereas Scotus’s\nconcept of a radius sweeping out the circumference of the circle is\ncorrect, since the entire circle does not exist all at once.\nConsequently, ‘now’ moves from past to future like a point\non the circumference of a circle. Kilvington, like Scotus, also\nrejects the view that God knows future contingents via Ideas because\nIdeas necessarily represent what they represent, as in the sentence,\n“Socrates is Artus”, where it is said that Socrates is\nArtus. Although Kilvington does not explain his position clearly, it\nseems that he takes for granted Scotus’s explanation. Scotus\nsays that perhaps Ideas could represent simple or complexes terms\nnecessarily, although, as Chris Schabel puts it: \nKilvington is also in agreement with Scotus when he says that\nsecondary causes cannot originate any contingency because of the\nnecessity in a chain of causes. Therefore, a contingency observed in\nthe action of secondary causes must be routed to the first cause,\nwhich is God. To know contingents, God first has to choose one of two\ncontrary statements, since otherwise, i.e., when God had an act of\nknowledge before his act of will, he would have had only necessary\nordained knowledge about natural order, which he already established,\nand he would not know contingents. Consequently, God would have only\npartial knowledge about one side of a contradiction (i.e., he would\nknow only one of two contradictory statements, e.g., “Antichrist\nwill be” or “Antichrist will not be”), and his will\nwould not be absolutely free. Therefore, contingency must be placed in\nGod’s will and not in God’s intellect. Again following\nScotus, Kilvington claims that at the same instant in which the divine\nwill wills A, it is able not to will A. Like Ockham,\nKilvington accepts Scotus’s synchronic contingency. Again, as\nChris Schabel writes: \nTo save God’s absolute free will and at the same time to avoid\nthe prospect of mutability in God’s decision-making, Kilvington\nasserts that by his absolute power God can make himself not to will\nA, while A is what God, by his ordained power, wills in\nthat particular instant, and this happens in eternity. This argument\nproves that there is no change in God’s will. In the opinion of\nKilvington, future contingent events are such because God knows that\nthey are future contingent and not vice versa. God’s accepting\n(beneplacitum) will, with respect to future contingents, is\nnaturally prior to God’s knowledge, because the following\nconsequence is true, “God wants A to happen; therefore,\nGod knows it will happen,” whereas this is false, “God\nknows it will happen (viz., that Socrates will sin); therefore, he\nwants him to sin”. \nIn Kilvington’s commentary on Sentences, the opinions\nof both Scotus and Ockham are much in evidence, as in\nKilvington’s other works. However, while Scotus is often cited\nby name, Ockham remains in the background. Still, knowledge of both\nScotus and Ockham is crucial to understanding Kilvington’s\nthought, as his own contributions are often the result of blending\nthese two strands of fourteenth-century Franciscan theology. A good\nexample is the concept of God’s absolute and ordained powers,\nwhich serves Kilvington to prove that unequal infinities are present\nnot only in God but also in the created world. \nBesides the particular topics he discussed, Kilvington’s\nextensive use of sophisma argumentation, his mathematization\nof ethics and theology, and his frequent use of hypothetical\n(secundum imaginationem) cases, place his thought in the\nmainstream of fourteenth-century English philosophy and theology. His\nteachings on logic were influential both in England and on the\nContinent. Richard Billingham, Roger Rosetus, William Heytesbury, Adam\nWodeham, Richard Swineshead were among the English scholars who\nbenefited from Kilvington’s Sophsimata. His\nQuaestiones super De generatione et corruptione was quoted by\nRichard Fitzralph, Adam Wodeham, and Blasius of Parma, and his\nQuaestiones super Physicam was familiar to the next\ngeneration of Oxford Calculators, John Dumbleton and Roger Swineshead\n(who also may have influenced Parisian masters such as Nicolas Oresme\nand John Buridan). But Thomas Bradwardine was perhaps the most famous\nstudent of Kilvington’s theory of motion. In his renowned\ntreatise On the Ratios of Velocities in Motions, Bradwardine\nincluded most of Kilvington’s arguments for a new function\ndescribing the relation of motive power and resistance.\nKilvington’s views on future contingents were discussed by\nmasters at the University of Vienna in the first decade of the\nfifteenth century such as Nicholas of Dinkelsbühl, John Berwart\nof Villingen, Peter of Pulkau, and the Carmelite Arnold of Seehausen.\nHis questions on the Ethics and the Sentences\nenjoyed a reputation not only in Oxford but also Paris and were\nfrequently quoted by Adam Junior, John of Mirecourt, Johanes de Burgo,\nand Thomas of Krakow (see Jung-[Palczewska] 2000b).","contact.mail":"ejung@uni.lodz.pl","contact.domain":"uni.lodz.pl"}]
