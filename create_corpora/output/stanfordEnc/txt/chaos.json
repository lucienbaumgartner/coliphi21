The so-called butterfly effect has become one of\nthe most popular images of chaos. The idea is that the flapping of a\nbutterfly’s wings in Argentina could cause a tornado in Texas three\nweeks later. By contrast, in an identical copy of the world sans the\nArgentinian butterfly, no such storm would have arisen in Texas. The\nmathematical version of this property is known as sensitive\ndependence. However, it turns out that sensitive dependence is\nsomewhat old news, so some of the implications flowing from it are\nperhaps not such “big news” after all. Still, chaos\nstudies have highlighted these implications in fresh ways and led to\nthinking about other implications as well.\n\n\n\n In addition to exhibiting sensitive dependence, chaotic systems\npossess two other properties: they are deterministic and nonlinear\n(Smith 2007). This entry discusses systems exhibiting these three\nproperties and what their philosophical implications might be for\ntheories and theoretical understanding, confirmation, explanation,\nrealism, determinism, free will and consciousness, and human and\ndivine action.\n\n\n\n The mathematical phenomenon of chaos is studied in sciences as\ndiverse as astronomy, meteorology, population biology, economics and\nsocial psychology. While there are few (if any) causal mechanisms such\ndiverse disciplines have in common, the phenomenological behavior of\nchaos—e.g., sensitivity to the tiniest changes in initial\nconditions or seemingly random and unpredictable behavior that\nnevertheless follows precise rules—appears in many of the models\nin these disciplines. Observing similar chaotic behavior in such\ndiverse fields certainly presents a challenge to our understanding of\nchaos as a phenomenon.  Arguably, one can say that Aristotle was already aware of\nsomething similar to what we now call sensitive dependence. Writing\nabout methodology and epistemology, he observed that “the least\ninitial deviation from the truth is multiplied later a\nthousandfold” (Aristotle OTH, 271b8). Nevertheless, thinking\nabout how small disturbances might grow explosively to produce\nsubstantial effects on a physical system’s behavior became a\nphenomenon of ever intensifying investigation beginning with a famous\npaper by Edward Lorenz (1963.) He noted that a particular\nmeteorological model could exhibit exquisitely sensitive dependence on\nsmall changes in initial conditions. French mathematician Jacques\nHadamard had already developed the framework for partial differential\nequations exhibiting both continuous and discontinuous dependence on\ninitial conditions by 1922. Any equations exhibiting sensitive but\ncontinuous dependence are well-posed problems under his framework;\nhowever, he raised the possibility that any solution to equations for\na physical system exhibiting such sensitive dependence could indicate\nthat the target system obeyed no laws (Hadamard 1922, p. 38). Lorenz’s\npioneering work demonstrated that such sensitive dependence was not a\nmatter of mathematical misdescription; rather, there was something\ninteresting in the mathematical model exhibiting chaos. Moreover,\nLorenz’s and subsequent work indicated that there seemed to be no\nissue of the law-likeness of target systems whose models exhibited\nsensitive dependence.  \nThough some other scientists and mathematicians prior to Lorenz had\nexamined such phenomena, these were basically isolated investigations\nnever producing a recognizable, sustained field of inquiry as happened\nafter the publication of Lorenz’s seminal paper. Sensitive dependence\non initial conditions (SDIC) for some systems had already been\nidentified by James Clerk Maxwell (1876, p. 13). He described\nsuch phenomena as being cases where the “physical axiom”\nthat from like antecedents flow like consequences is violated. Like\nothers Maxwell recognized this kind of behavior could be found in\nsystems with a sufficiently large number of variables (possessing a\nsufficient level of complexity in this numerical sense). But he also\nargued that such sensitive dependence could happen the case of two\nspheres colliding (1860). Henri Poincaré (1913), on the other\nhand, later recognized that this same kind of behavior could be\nrealized in systems with a small number of variables (simple systems\nexhibiting very complicated behavior). Pierre Duhem, relying on work\nby Hadamard and Poincaré, further articulated the practical\nconsequences of SDIC for the scientist interested in deducing\nmathematically precise consequences from mathematical models (1982,\npp. 138–142).\n \n\n Poincaré discussed examples that, in hindsight, we can view as\nraising doubts about taking explosive growth of small effects to be a\nsufficient condition for defining chaos. First, consider a perfectly\nsymmetric cone precisely balanced on its tip with only the force of\ngravity acting on it. In the absence of any impressed forces, the cone\nwould maintain this unstable equilibrium forever. It is unstable\nbecause the smallest nudge, from an air molecule, say, will cause the cone to\ntip over, but it could tip over in any direction due to the slight\ndifferences in various perturbations arising from suffering different\ncollisions with different molecules. Here, variations in the slightest\ncauses issue forth in dramatically different effects (a violation of\nMaxwell’s physical axiom). If we were to plot the tipping over\nof the unstable cone, we would see that from a small ball of starting\nconditions, a number of different trajectories issuing forth from this\nball would quickly diverge from each other.  \n\nThe concept of nearby trajectories diverging or growing away from each\nother plays an important role in discussions of chaos. Three useful\nbenchmarks for characterizing trajectory divergence are linear,\nexponential and geometric growth rates. Linear growth can be\nrepresented by the simple expression \\(y = ax+b\\), where \\(a\\) is an\narbitrary positive constant and \\(b\\) is an arbitrary constant. A\nspecial case of linear growth is illustrated by stacking pennies on a\ncheckerboard \\((a = 1\\), \\(b = 0)\\). If we use the rule of placing one\npenny on the first square, two pennies on the second square, three\npennies on the third square, and so forth, we will end up with 64\npennies stacked on the last square. The total number of pennies on the\ncheckerboard will be 2080. Exponential growth can be\nrepresented by the expression \\(y = n_{0}e^{ax}\\), where \\(n_{0}\\) is\nsome initial quantity (say the initial number of pennies to be\nstacked) and \\(a\\) is an arbitrary positive constant. \\((n_{0}\\) is\ncalled ‘initial’ because when \\(x = 0\\) (the\n‘initial time’), we get \\(y = n_{0}\\).) Going back to our\npenny stacking analogy \\((a = 1)\\), we again start with placing 1\npenny on the first square, but now about 2.7 pennies are stacked on\nthe second square, about 7.4 pennies on the third square, and so\nforth, and we finally end up with about \\(6.2 \\times 10^{27}\\) pennies\nstaked on the last square! Clearly, exponential growth outpaces linear\nvery rapidly. Finally, we have\ngeometric growth, which can be represented by the expression\n\\(y = a^{bx}\\), where \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) are arbitrary positive constants. Note that in the case\n\\(a = e\\) and \\(b = 1\\), we\nrecover the exponential \n case.[1] \n\nMany authors consider an important mark of chaos to be trajectories\nissuing from nearby points diverging from one another exponentially\nquickly. However, it is also possible for trajectory divergence to be\nfaster than exponential. Take Poincaré’s example of a molecule\nin a gas of \\(N\\) molecules. If this molecule suffered the\nslightest of deviations from its initial starting point and you\ncompared the molecule’s trajectories from these two slightly different\nstarting points, the resulting trajectories would diverge at a\ngeometric rate, to the \\(n\\)th power, due to\nthe \\(n\\) subsequent collisions, each being different than what\nit would have been had there been no slight change in the initial\ncondition. \n\nA third example discussed by Poincaré is of a man walking on a\nstreet on his way to his business. He starts out at a particular\ntime. Meanwhile unknown to him, there is a tiler working on the roof\nof a building on the same street. The tiler accidentally drops a tile,\nkilling the business man. Had the business man started out at a\nslightly earlier or later time, the outcome of his trajectory would\nhave been vastly different! \n Many intuitively think that the example of the business man is\nqualitatively different from Poincaré’s other two examples and\nhas nothing to do with chaos at all. However, the cone unstably\nbalanced on its tip that begins to fall also is not a chaotic system\nas it has no other identifying features usually picked out as\nbelonging to chaotic dynamics, such as nonlinear behavior (see\nbelow). Furthermore, it only has one unstable point—the\ntip—whereas chaos usually requires instability at nearly all\npoints in a region (see below). To be able to identify systems as\nchaotic or not, we need a definition or a list of distinguishing\ncharacteristics. But coming up with a workable, broadly applicable\ndefinition of chaos has been problematic.\n \n To begin, chaos is typically understood as a mathematical property of\na dynamical system. A dynamical system is a deterministic\nmathematical model, where time can be either a continuous or a\ndiscrete variable. Such models may be studied as mathematical objects\nor may be used to describe a target system (some kind of physical,\nbiological or economic system, say). I will return to the question of\nusing mathematical models to represent actual-world systems throughout\nthis article. \nFor our purposes, we will consider a mathematical model to be\ndeterministic if it exhibits unique evolution:\n \n (Unique Evolution) \n A given state of a model\n is always followed by the same history of state transitions.\n \n A simple example of a dynamical system would be the equations\ndescribing the motion of a pendulum. The equations of a dynamical\nsystem are often referred to as dynamical or evolution equations\ndescribing the change in time of variables taken to adequately\ndescribe the target system (e.g., the velocity as a function of time\nfor a pendulum). A complete specification of the initial state of such\nequations is referred to as the initial conditions for the model,\nwhile a characterization of the boundaries for the model domain are\nknown as the boundary conditions. An example of a dynamical system\nwith a boundary condition would be the equation modeling the flight of\na rubber ball fired at a wall by a small cannon. The boundary\ncondition might be that the wall absorbs no kinetic energy (energy of\nmotion) so that the ball is reflected off the wall with no loss of\nenergy. The initial conditions would be the position and velocity of\nthe ball as it left the mouth of the cannon. The dynamical system\nwould then describe the flight of the ball to and from the wall.  \n Although some popularized discussions of chaos have claimed that it\ninvalidates determinism, there is nothing inconsistent about systems\nhaving the property of unique evolution while exhibiting chaotic\nbehavior (much of the confusion over determinism derives from equating\ndeterminism with predictability—see below). While it is true that\napparent randomness can be generated if the state space (see below)\none uses to analyze chaotic behavior is coarse-grained, this produces\nonly an epistemic form of nondeterminism. The underlying equations are\nstill fully deterministic. If there is a breakdown of determinism in\nchaotic systems, that can only occur if there is some kind of\nindeterminism introduced such that the property of unique evolution is\nrendered false (e.g., §4 below).\n \n The dynamical systems of interest in chaos studies are\nnonlinear, such as the Lorenz model equations for convection\nin fluids:\n \n A dynamical system is characterized as linear or nonlinear depending\non the nature of the equations of motion describing the target system.\nConsider a differential equation system, such as\n\\(d\\bx/dt = \\bF\\bx\\)\nfor a set of variables \\(\\bx = x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\).\nThese variables might represent positions,\nmomenta, chemical concentration or other key features of the target\nsystem, and the system of equations tells us how these key variables\nchange with time. Suppose that\n\\(\\bx_{1}(t)\\) and\n\\(\\bx_{2}(t)\\) are solutions of\nthe equation system\n\\(d\\bx/dt = \\bF\\bx\\). \nIf the system of equations is linear, it can easily be shown that\n\\(\\bx_{3}(t) = a\\bx_{1}(t)+ b\\bx_{2}(t)\\) is\nalso a solution, where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are constants. This\nis known as the principle of linear superposition. So if the\nmatrix of coefficients \\(\\bF\\) does not contain\nany of the variables \\(\\bx\\) or functions of them,\nthen the principle of linear superposition holds. If the principle of\nlinear superposition holds, then, roughly, a system behaves linearly:\nAny multiplicative change in a variable, by a factor \\(\\alpha\\) say,\nimplies a multiplicative or proportional change of its output by\n\\(\\alpha\\). For example, if you start with your stereo at low volume and\nturn the volume control one unit, the volume increases by one unit. If\nyou now turn the control two units, the volume increases two\nunits. This is an example of a linear response. In a nonlinear system,\nsuch as (Lorenz), linear superposition fails and a system need not\nchange proportionally to the change in a variable. If you turn your\nvolume control too far, the volume may not only increase more than the\nnumber of units of the turn, but whistles and various other\ndistortions occur in the sound. These are examples of a nonlinear\nresponse.  \nMuch of the modeling of physical systems takes place in what is\ncalled state space, an abstract mathematical space of points\nwhere each point represents a possible state of the system. An\ninstantaneous state is taken to be characterized by the instantaneous\nvalues of the variables considered crucial for a complete description\nof the state. One advantage of working in state space is that it often\nallows us to study useful geometric properties of the trajectories of the\ntarget system without knowing the exact solutions to the dynamical\nequations. When the state of the system is fully characterized by\nposition and momentum variables, the resulting space is often called\nphase space. A model can be studied in state space by\nfollowing its trajectory from the initial state to some chosen final\nstate. The evolution equations govern the path—the history of\nstate transitions—of the system in state space.\n \n\nHowever, note that some crucial assumptions are being made here. We\nare assuming, for instance, that a state of a system is characterized\nby the values of the crucial variables and that a physical state\ncorresponds via these values to a point in state space. These\nassumptions allow us to develop mathematical models for the evolution\nof these points in state space and such models are taken to represent\n(perhaps through an isomorphism or some more complicated relation) the\nphysical systems of interest. In other words, we assume that our\nmathematical models are faithful representations of physical systems\nand that the state spaces employed faithfully represent the space of\nactual possibilities of target systems. This package of assumptions is\nknown as the faithful model assumption (e.g., Bishop\n2005), and, in its idealized limit—the perfect model\nscenario—it can license the (perhaps sloppy) slide between\nmodel talk and system talk (i.e., whatever is true of the model is\nalso true of the target system and vice versa). In the context of\nnonlinear models, faithfulness appears to be inadequate \n (§3). \n The question of defining chaos is basically the question what makes a\ndynamical system such as (1) chaotic rather than nonchaotic. But this\nturns out to be a hard question to answer! Stephen Kellert defines\nchaos theory as “the qualitative study of unstable aperiodic\nbehavior in deterministic nonlinear dynamical systems” (1993,\np. 2). This definition restricts chaos to being a property of\nnonlinear dynamical systems (although in his (1993), Kellert is\nsometimes ambiguous as to whether chaos is only a behavior of\nmathematical models or of actual-world systems). That is, chaos is\nchiefly a property of particular types of mathematical\nmodels. Furthermore, Kellert’s definition picks out two key features\nthat are simultaneously present: instability and\naperiodicity. Unstable systems are those exhibiting SDIC. Aperiodic\nbehavior means that the system variables never repeat any values in\nany regular fashion. I take it that the “theory” part of\nhis definition has much to do with the “qualitative study”\nof such systems, so let’s leave that part for\n §2. \n Chaos, then, appears to be unstable aperiodic behavior in nonlinear\ndynamical systems.  \nThis definition is both qualitative and restrictive. It is\nqualitative in that there are no mathematically precise criteria given\nfor the unstable and aperiodic nature of the behavior in question,\nalthough there are some ways of characterizing these aspects (the\nnotions of dynamical system and nonlinearity have precise mathematical\nmeanings). Of course can one add mathematically precise definitions of\ninstability and aperiodicity, but this precision may not actually lead\nto useful improvements in the definition (see below).\n \nThe definition is restrictive in that it limits chaos to be a\nproperty of mathematical models, so the import for actual physical\nsystems becomes tenuous. At this point we must invoke the faithful\nmodel assumption—namely, that our mathematical models and their\nstate spaces have a close correspondence to target systems and their\npossible behaviors—to forge a link between this definition and\nchaos in actual systems. Immediately we face two related questions here:\n \n Furthermore, Kellert’s definition may also be too broad to pick out\nonly chaotic behaviors. For instance, take the iterative map\n\\(x_{n + 1} = cx_{n}\\).\nThis map obviously exhibits only orbits that are unstable and\naperiodic. For instance, choosing the values \\(c = 1.1\\) and\n\\(x_{0} = .5\\), successive iterations will\ncontinue to increase and never return near the original value of\n\\(x_{0}\\). So Kellert’s definition would\nclassify this map as chaotic, but the map does not have any other\nproperties qualifying it as chaotic. This suggests Kellert’s\ndefinition of chaos would pick out a much broader set of behaviors\nthan what is normally accepted as chaotic.  \n Part of Robert Batterman’s (1993) discusses problematic definitions\nof chaos, namely, those that focus on notions of\nunpredictability. This certainly is neither necessary nor sufficient\nto distinguish chaos from sheer random behavior. Batterman does not\nactually specify an alternative definition of chaos. He suggests that\nexponential instability—the exponential divergence of two\ntrajectories issuing forth from neighboring initial\nconditions (taken by many as the defining feature of SDIC)—is a\nnecessary condition, but leaves it open as to whether it is\nsufficient.  Figure 1: The Lorenz Attractor\n \n However, what does appear to pass as a crucial feature of chaos for\nBatterman—a definition if you will—is the presence of a\nkind of “stretching and folding” mechanism in the dynamics\n(see the discussion on p. 49 and figure 5 of his\nessay). Basically such a mechanism will cause some trajectories to\nconverge rapidly while causing other trajectories to diverge\nrapidly. Such a mechanism would tend to cause trajectories issuing\nfrom various points in some small neighborhood of state space to mix\nand separate in rather dramatic ways. For instance, some initially\nneighboring trajectories on the Lorenz attractor (Figure 1) become\nseparated, where some end up on one wing while others end up on the\nother wing rather rapidly. This stretching and folding is part of what leads to\ndefinitions of the distance between trajectories in state space as\nincreasing (diverging) on average.  \nThe presence of such a mechanism in the dynamics, Batterman\nbelieves, is a necessary condition for chaos. As such, this defining\ncharacteristic could be applied to both mathematical models and\nactual-world systems, though the identification of such mechanisms in\ntarget systems may be rather tricky.\n \nLet us start with the property of SDIC and distinguish weak and strong\nforms of sensitive dependence (somewhat following Smith 1998). Weak\nsensitive dependence can be characterized as follows. Consider the\npropagator, \\(\\bJ(\\bx(t))\\),\na function that evolves\ntrajectories \\(\\bx(t)\\) in time (an\nexample of a propagator is given in\nthe Appendix). Let \\(\\bx(0)\\)\nand \\(\\by(0)\\) be initial conditions for two\ndifferent trajectories. Then, weak sensitive dependence can be defined\nas\n \n (WSD) A system characterized\n by \\(\\bJ(\\bx(t))\\)\n has the property of weak sensitive dependence on its initial\n conditions if and only if\n \\(\\exists \\varepsilon \\gt 0\\) \\(\\forall \\bx(0)\\) \\(\\forall \\delta \\gt 0\\)\n \\(\\exists t\\gt 0\\) \\(\\exists \\by(0)\\), \\(\\abs{\\bx(0) - \\by(0)} \\lt \\delta\\) and \n \\(\\abs{\\bJ(\\bx(t)) - \\bJ(\\by(t))} \\gt \\varepsilon.\\)\n \n\nThe essential idea is that the propagator acts so that no matter how close together\n\\(\\bx(0)\\) and\n\\(\\by(0)\\) are the\ntrajectory initiating from \\(\\by(0)\\) will\neventually diverge by \\(\\varepsilon\\) from the trajectory initiating from\n\\(\\bx(0)\\). However, WSD does not specify the rate\nof divergence (it is compatible with linear rates of divergence) nor\ndoes it specify how many points surrounding\n\\(\\bx(0)\\) will give rise to diverging\ntrajectories (it could be a set of any measure, e.g.,\nzero).  \nOn the other hand, chaos is usually characterized by a strong form\nof sensitive dependence:\n \n(SD) \n \\(\\exists \\lambda\\) such that for almost all points \\(\\bx(0)\\), \n \\(\\forall \\delta \\gt 0\\) \\(\\exists t\\gt 0\\) such that\n for almost all points \\(\\by(0)\\) in a small\nneighborhood \\((\\delta)\\) around\n\\(\\bx(0)\\), \\(\\abs{\\bx(0) - \\by(0)}\\lt \\delta\\) and\n\\(\\abs{\\bJ(\\bx(t)) - \\bJ(\\by(t))} \\approx \n\\abs{\\bJ(\\bx(0)) - \\bJ(\\by(0))}e^{\\lambda t}\\),\n \nwhere the “almost all” caveat is understood as applying\nfor all points in state space except a set of measure zero. Here,\n\\(\\lambda\\) is interpreted as the largest global Lyapunov exponent (see\nthe \n Appendix)\n and is taken to represent the\naverage rate of divergence of neighboring trajectories issuing forth\nfrom some small neighborhood\n centered around \\(\\bx(0)\\). Exponential\ngrowth is implied if \\(\\lambda \\gt 0\\) (convergence if \\(\\lambda \\lt 0)\\).\nIn general, such growth cannot go on forever. If the system is bounded\nin space and in momentum, there will be limits as to how far nearby\ntrajectories can diverge from one\nanother. \n\nNote that according to SD, Poincaré’s first two examples\nwould fail to qualify as characterizing a chaotic system (the first\none exhibits an entire range of growth rates from zero to larger than\nexponential, while the second one exhibits growth larger than\nexponential). On the other hand, these examples do satisfy WSD.  \n One strategy for devising a definition for chaos is to begin with\ndiscrete maps and then generalize to the continuous case. For example,\nif one begins with a continuous system, by using a Poincaré\nsurface of section—roughly, a two-dimensional plane is defined\nand one plots the intersections of trajectories with this\nplane—a discrete map can be generated. If the original\ncontinuous system exhibits chaotic behavior, then the discrete map\ngenerated by the surface of section will also be chaotic because the\nsurface of section will have the same topological properties as the\ncontinuous system. Robert Devaney’s influential definition of chaos\n(1989) was proposed in this fashion.   Let \\(f\\) be a function defined on some state space \\(S\\). In the\ncontinuous case, \\(f\\) would vary continuously on \\(S\\) and we might\nhave a differential equation specifying how \\(f\\) varies. In the\ndiscrete case, \\(f\\) can be thought of as a mapping that can be\niterated or reapplied a number of times. To indicate this, we can\nwrite \\(f^{n}(x)\\), meaning \\(f\\) is applied iteratively \\(n\\)\ntimes. For instance, \\(f^{3}(x)\\) would indicate \\(f\\) has been\napplied three times, thus \\(f^{3}(x) = f(f(f(x)))\\) (Robert\nMay’s classic 1976 review article has a nice discussion of this\nfor the logistic map, \\(x_{n + 1} = rx_{n}(1 - x_{n})\\), which\narises in modeling the dynamics of predator-prey relations, for\ninstance.). Furthermore, let \\(K\\) be a subset of \\(S\\).  Then\n\\(f(K)\\) represents \\(f\\) applied to the set of points \\(K\\), that is,\n\\(f\\) maps the set \\(K\\) into \\(f(K)\\). If \\(f(K) = K\\), then \\(K\\) is\nan invariant set under \\(f\\).  \nNow Devaney’s definition of chaos can be stated as follows:\n \n (Chaos\\(_{d})\\) \n A continuous map \\(f\\) is chaotic\n\tif \\(f\\) has an invariant set \\(K\\subseteq S\\)\n\tsuch that \nTopological transitivity is the following notion: consider open sets\n\\(U\\) and \\(V\\) around the points \\(u\\) and \\(v\\)\nrespectively. Regardless how small \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are, some\ntrajectory initiating from \\(U\\) eventually visits \\(V\\).\nThis condition roughly guarantees that trajectories starting from\npoints in \\(U\\) will eventually fill \\(S\\) densely. Taken\ntogether, these three conditions represent an attempt to precisely\ncharacterize the kind of irregular, aperiodic behavior we expect\nchaotic systems to exhibit.\n \nDevaney’s definition has the virtues of being precise and\ncompact. However, objections have been raised against it. Since the\ntime he proposed his definition, it has been shown that (2) and (3)\nimply (1) if the set \\(K\\) has an infinite number of elements\n(see Banks et al. 1992), although this result does not hold for sets\nwith finite elements. More to the point, the definition seems\ncounterintuitive in that it emphasizes periodic orbits rather than\naperiodicity, but the latter seems a much better characterization of\nchaos. After all, it is precisely the lack of periodicity that is\ncharacteristic of chaos. To be fair to Devany, however, he casts his\ndefinition in terms of unstable periodic points, the kind of points\nwhere trajectories issuing forth from neighboring points would exhibit\nWSD. If the set of unstable periodic points is dense in \\(K\\),\nthen we have a guarantee that the kinds of aperiodic orbits\ncharacteristic of chaos will be abundant. Some have argued that (2) is\nnot even necessary for characterizing chaos (e.g., Robinson 1995,\npp. 83–4). Furthermore, nothing in Devaney’s\ndefinition hints at the stretching and folding of trajectories, which\nappears to be a necessary condition for chaos from a qualitative\nperspective. Peter Smith (1998, pp. 176–7) suggests that\nChaos\\(_{d}\\) is, perhaps, a consequence rather than a mark of\nchaos.\n \nAnother possibility for capturing the concept of the folding and\nstretching of trajectories so characteristic of chaotic dynamics is the\nfollowing:\n \n (Chaos\\(_{h})\\) \n A discrete\n map \\(f\\) is chaotic if, for some iteration\n \\(n \\ge 1\\), it maps the unit interval\n \\(I\\) into a horseshoe (see Figure 2). \n Figure 2: The Smale Horseshoe \n\nTo construct the Smale horseshoe map (Figure 2), start with the unit\nsquare (indicated in yellow). First, stretch it in the \\(y\\)\ndirection by more than a factor of two. Then compress it in\nthe \\(x\\) direction by more than a factor of two. Now, fold the\nresulting rectangle and lay it back onto the square so that the\nconstruction overlaps and leaves the middle and vertical edges of the\ninitial unit square uncovered. Repeating these stretching and folding\noperations leads to the Samale attractor. \nThis definition has at least two virtues. First, it can be proven\nthat Chaos\\(_{h}\\) implies Chaos\\(_{d}\\). Second, it yields\nexponential divergence, so we get SD, which is what many people expect\nfor chaotic systems. However, it has a significant disadvantage in\nthat it cannot be applied to invertible maps, the kinds of maps\ncharacteristic of many systems exhibiting Hamiltonian chaos. A\nHamiltonian system is one where the total kinetic energy plus\npotential energy is conserved; in contrast, dissipative systems lose\nenergy through some dissipative mechanism such as friction or\nviscosity. Hamiltonian chaos, then, is chaotic behavior in a\nHamiltonian system. \n\nOther possible definitions have been suggested in the literature.\nFor instance (Smith 1998, pp. 181–2), \n (Chaos\\(_{te})\\) \n A discrete map is chaotic just in case it\nexhibits topological entropy: Let \\(f\\) be a discrete\nmap and \\(\\{W_{i}\\}\\) be a partition of a bounded\nregion \\(W\\) containing a probability measure which is invariant\nunder \\(f\\). Then the topological entropy of \\(f\\) is\ndefined as \n\\(h_{T}(f) = \\sup_{\\{W_i\\}h(f,\\{W_i\\})}\\), \nwhere sup is the supremum of the set \\(\\{W_{i}\\}\\).\n  Roughly, given the points in a neighborhood \\(N\\) around\n\\(\\bx(0)\\) less than \\(\\varepsilon\\) away from each\nother, after \\(n\\) iterates of \\(f\\) the trajectories\ninitiating from the points in \\(N\\) will differ by \\(\\varepsilon\\) or\ngreater, where more and more trajectories will differ by at least\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) as \\(n\\) increases. In the case of one-dimensional\nmaps, however, it can be shown that Chaos\\(_{h}\\) implies\nChaos\\(_{te}\\). So this does not look to be a basic definition,\nthough it is often more useful for proving theorems relative to the\nother definitions.  \nAnother candidate, often found in the physics literature, is\n \n (Chaos\\(_{\\lambda})\\) \n A discrete map\n is chaotic if it has a positive global Lyapunov exponent.\n \nThe meaning of positivity here is that a global Lyapunov exponent is\npositive for almost all points in the specified set \\(S\\). This\ndefinition certainly is directly connected to SD and is one physicists\noften use to characterize systems as chaotic. Furthermore, it offers\npractical advantages when it comes to calculations and can often be\n“straightforwardly” related to experimental data in the\nsense of examining data sets generated from physical systems for\nglobal Lyapunov \n exponents.[2]  \n\nOne might think that SD, Chaos\\(_{te}\\) or\nChaos\\(_{\\lambda}\\) could be sufficient for defining chaos, but\nthese characterizations run into problems from simple counterexamples.\nFor instance, consider a discrete dynamical system with\n\\(S = [0, \\infty)\\), the absolute value as a metric\n(i.e., as the function that defines the distance between two points)\non \\(\\mathbf{R}\\), and a mapping \\(f: [(0, \\infty) \\rightarrow [0,\\infty)\\),\n\\(f(x) = cx\\), where \\(c \\gt 1\\).\nIn this dynamical system, all neighboring trajectories diverge\nexponentially fast, but all accelerate off to infinity. However,\nchaotic dynamics is usually characterized as being confined to some\nattractor—a strange attractor (see sec. 5.1 below) in the case\nof dissipative systems, the energy surface in the case of Hamiltonian\nsystems. This confinement need not be due to physical walls of some\ncontainer. If, in the case of Hamiltonian chaos, the dynamics is\nconfined to an energy surface (by the action of a force like gravity),\nthis surface could be spatially unbounded. So at the very least some\nadditional conditions are needed (e.g., that guarantee trajectories in\nstate space are dense).  \nIn much physics and philosophy literature, something like the\nfollowing set of conditions seems to be assumed as adequately defining\nchaos:\n \nOf these three features, (c) is often taken to be crucial to defining\nSDIC and is often suspected as being related to the other two. That\nis to say, exponential growth in the separation of neighboring\ntrajectories characterized by \\(\\lambda\\) is taken to be a property of a\nparticular kind of dynamics that can only exist in nonlinear systems\nand models.  \nThough the favored approaches to defining chaos involve global\nLyapunov exponents, there are problems with this way of defining SDIC\n(and, hence, characterizing chaos). First, the definition of global\nLyapunov exponents involves the infinite time limit (see\nthe\n Appendix),\n so, strictly speaking, \\(\\lambda\\) only characterizes growth in\nuncertainties as \\(t\\) increases without bounds, not for any\nfinite \\(t\\). So the combination \\(\\exists \\lambda\\) and\n\\(\\exists t\\gt 0\\) in SD is inconsistent. At best, SD can only\nhold for the large time limit and this implies that chaos as a\nphenomenon can only arise in this limit, contrary to what we take to\nbe our best evidence. Furthermore, neither our models nor physical\nsystems run for infinite time, but an infinitely long time is required\nto verify the presumed exponential divergence of trajectories issuing\nfrom infinitesimally close points in state space.   On might try to get around these problems by invoking the standard\nphysicist’s assumption that an infinite-time limit can be used to\neffectively represent some large but finite elapsed time.\nHowever, one reason to doubt this assumption in the context of chaos\nis that the calculation of finite-time Lyapunov exponents do not\nusually lead to on-average exponential growth as characterized by\nglobal Lyapunov exponents (e.g., Smith, Ziehmann and Fraedrich\n1999). In general, for finite times the propagator varies from point to point\nin state space (i.e., it is a function of the position\n\\(\\bx(t)\\) in state space and only approaches a\nconstant in the infinite time limit), implying that the local\nfinite-time Lyapunov exponents vary from point to point. Therefore,\ntrajectories diverge and converge from each other at various rates as\nthey evolve in time—the uncertainty does not vary uniformly in\nthe chaotic region of state space (Smith, Ziehmann and Fraedrich 1999;\nSmith 2000). This is in contrast to global Lyapunov exponents which\nare on-average global measures of trajectory divergence and which\nimply that uncertainty grows uniformly (for \\(\\lambda \\gt 0)\\), but such\nuniform growth rarely occurs outside a few simple mathematical\nmodels. For instance, the Lorenz, Moore-Spiegel, Rössler, Henon\nand Ikeda attractors all possess regions dominated by decreasing\nuncertainties in time, where uncertainties associated with different\ntrajectories issuing forth from some small neighborhood shrink for the\namount of time trajectories remain within such regions (e.g., Smith,\nZiehmann and Fraedrich 1999, pp. 2870–9; Ziehmann, Smith\nand Kurths 2000, pp. 273–83). Hence, on-average exponential\ngrowth in trajectory divergence is not guaranteed for chaotic\ndynamics. Linear stability analysis can indicate when nonlinearities\ncan be expected to dominate the dynamics, and local finite-time\nLyapunov exponents can indicate regions on an attractor where these\nnonlinearities will cause all uncertainties to\ndecrease—cause trajectories to converge rather than\ndiverge—so long as trajectories remain in those regions.  \nTo summarize, the folklore that trajectories issuing forth from\nneighboring points will diverge on-average exponentially\nin a chaotic region of state space is false in any sense other than for\ninfinitesimal uncertainties in the infinite time limit for simple mathematical models.\n \nThe second problem with the standard account is that there simply is\nno implication that finite uncertainties will exhibit an on-average\ngrowth rate characterized by any Lyapunov exponents, local or global.\nFor example, the linearized dynamics used to derive global Lyapunov\nexponents presupposes infinitesimal uncertainties\n (Appendix (A1)–(A5)). \n But when uncertainties are finite, such dynamics do not apply and no\nvalid conclusions can be drawn about the dynamics of finite\nuncertainties from the dynamics of infinitesimal uncertainties.\nCertainly infinitesimal uncertainties never become finite in finite\ntime (barring super exponential growth). Even if infinitesimal\nuncertainties became finite after a finite time, that would presuppose\nthe dynamics is unconfined, whereas the interesting features of\nnonlinear dynamics usually take place in subregions of state space.\nPresupposing an unconfined dynamics would be inconsistent with the\nfeatures we are typically trying to capture.  \nCan the on average exponential growth rate characterizing SD ever be\nattributed legitimately to diverging trajectories if their separation\nis no longer infinitesimal? Examining simple models (e.g., the\nBaker’s transformation) might seem to indicate yes. However,\nanswering this question requires some care for more complex systems\nlike the Lorenz or Moore-Spiegel attractors. It may turn out that the\nrate of divergence in the finite separation between two nearby\ntrajectories in a chaotic region changes character numerous times over\nthe course of their winding around in state space, sometimes faster,\nsometimes slower than that calculated from global Lyapunov exponents,\nsometimes contracting, sometimes diverging (Smith, Ziehmann and\nFraedrich 1999; Ziehmann, Smith and Kurths 2000). But in the long run,\nsome of these trajectories could effectively diverge as\nif there was on-average exponential growth in uncertainties as\ncharacterized by global Lyapunov exponents. However, it is conjectured\nthat the set of initial points in the state space exhibiting this\nbehavior is a set of measure zero, meaning, in this context, that\nalthough there are an infinite number of points exhibiting this\nbehavior, this set represents zero percent of the number of points\ncomposing the attractor. The details of the kinds of divergence\n(convergence) neighboring trajectories undergo turn on the detailed\nstructure of the dynamics (i.e., it is determined point-by-point by\nlocal growth and convergence of finite uncertainties and not by any\nLyapunov exponents).\n \nBut as a practical matter, all finite uncertainties saturate at the\ndiameter of the attractor. This is to say, that the uncertainty reaches\nsome maximum amount of spreading after a finite time and is not well\nquantified by global measures derived from Lyapunov exponents (e.g.,\nLorenz 1965). So the folklore—that on-average exponential\ndivergence of trajectories characterizes chaotic dynamics—is\nmisleading for nonlinear models and systems, in particular the ones we\nwant to label as chaotic. Therefore, drawing an inference from the\npresence of positive global Lyapunov exponents to the existence of\non-average exponentially diverging trajectories is invalid. This has\nimplications for defining chaos because exponential growth\nparametrized by global Lyapunov exponents turns out not to be an\nappropriate measure. Hence, SD or Chaos\\(_{\\lambda}\\) turn out to\nbe misleading definitions of chaos.\n \nFinally, I want to briefly draw attention to the observer-dependent\nnature of global Lyapunov exponents in the special theory of\nrelativity. As has been recently demonstrated (Zheng, Misra and\nAtmanspacher 2003), global Lyapunov exponents change in magnitude under\nLorentz transformations, though not in sign—e.g., positive\nLyapunov exponents are always positive under Lorentz transformations.\nMoreover, under Rindler transformations, global Lyapunov exponents are\nnot invariant so that a system characterized as chaotic under SD or\nChaos\\(_{\\lambda}\\) for an accelerated Rindler observer turns out\nto be nonchaotic for an inertial Minkowski observer and any system that\nis chaotic for a an inertial Minkowski observer is nonchaotic for an\naccelerated Rindler observer. So along with the simultaneity subtleties\nraised for observers by Einstein’s theory of special relativity\n (see the entry on\n conventionality of simultaneity),\n chaos, at least under SD or Chaos\\(_{\\lambda}\\), turns out to\nalso have observer-dependent features for pairs of observers in\ndifferent reference frames. What these features mean for our\nunderstanding of the phenomenon of chaos remains largely unexplored.  \nThere is no consensus regarding a precise definition of chaotic\nbehavior among mathematicians and physicists, although physicists often\nprefer Chaos\\(_{h}\\) or Chaos\\(_{\\lambda}\\). The latter\ndefinitions, however, are trivially false for finite uncertainties in\nreal systems and of limited applicability for mathematical models. It\nalso appears to be the case that there is no one “right” or\n“correct” definition, but that varying definitions have\nvarying strengths and weaknesses regarding tradeoffs on generality,\ntheorem-generation, calculation ease and so forth. The best candidates\nfor necessary conditions for chaos still appear to be (1) WSD, which is\nrather weak, or (2) the presence of stretching and folding mechanisms\n(“pulls trajectories apart” in one dimension while\n“compressing them” in another).\n \nThe other worry is that the definitions we have been considering may\nonly hold for our mathematical models, but may not be applicable to actual\ntarget systems. The formal definitions seek to fully characterize\nchaotic behavior in mathematical models, but we are also interested in\ncapturing chaotic behavior in physical and biological systems as well.\nPhenomenologically, the kinds of chaotic behaviors we see in actual-world\nsystems exhibit features such as SDIC, aperiodicity, unpredictability,\ninstability under small perturbations and apparent randomness. However, given\nthat target systems run for only a finite amount of time and that the\nuncertainties are always larger than infinitesimal, such systems\nviolate the assumptions necessary for deriving SD. In other words, even\nif we have good statistical measures that yield on average exponential\ngrowth in uncertainties for a physical data set, what guarantee do we\nhave that this corresponds with the exponential growth of SD? After\nall, any growth in uncertainties (alternatively, any growth in distance\nbetween neighboring trajectories) can be fitted with an exponential. If\nthere is no physical significance to global Lyapunov exponents (because\nthey only apply to infinitesimal uncertainties), then one is free to\nchoose any parameter to fit an exponential for the growth in\nuncertainties.\n \nSo where does this leave us regarding a definition of chaos? Are all\nour attempts at definitions inadequate? Is there only one definition\nfor chaos, and if so, is it only a mathematical property or also a\nphysical one? Do we, perhaps, need multiple definitions (some of which\nare nonequivalent) to adequately characterize such complex and intricate\nbehavior? Is it reasonable to expect that the phenomenological features\nof chaos of interest to physicists and applied mathematicians can be\ncaptured in precise mathematical definitions given that there may be\nirreducible vagueness in the characterization of these features? From a\nphysical point of view, isn’t a phenomenological characterization\nsufficient for the purpose of identifying and exploring the underlying\nmechanisms responsible for the stretching and folding of trajectories?\nThe answers to these questions largely lie in our purposes for the\nkinds of inquiry in which we are engaged (e.g., proving rigorous\nmathematical theorems vs. detecting chaotic behavior in physical data\nvs. designing systems to control such behavior).\n \nSitting in the background for all of these discussions is\nnonlinearity. Chaos only exists in nonlinear systems (at least for\nclassical macroscopic systems; see sec. 6 for subtitles regarding\nquantum chaos). Nonlinearity appears to be a necessary condition for\nthe stretching and folding mechanisms, so would seem to be a necessary\ncondition for chaotic behavior. However, there is an alternative way\nto characterize the systems in which such stretching and folding takes\nplace: nonseparability.\n \nAs discussed in Section 1.2.2, linear systems always obey the principle\nof linear superposition. This implies that the Hamiltonians for such\nsystems are always separable. A separable Hamiltonian can always be\ntransformed into a sum of separate Hamiltonians with one element in\nthe sum corresponding to each subsystem. In effect, a separable system\nis one where the interactions among subsystems can be transformed away\nleaving the subsystems independent of each other. The whole is the sum\nof the parts, as it were. Chaos is impossible for separable\nHamiltonians. For a nonlinear systems, by contrast, Hamiltonians are\nnever separable. There are no transformation techniques that can turn\na nonseparable Hamiltonian into the sum of separate Hamiltonians. In\nother words, the interactions in a nonlinear system cannot be\ndecomposed into individual independent subsystems, nor can the whole\nsystem and its environment be ignored (Bishop 2010a). Nonseparable\nclassical systems are the kinds of systems where chaotic behavior can\nmanifest itself. So alternatively one could say that nonseparability\nof a Hamiltonian is a necessary condition for stretching and folding\nmechanisms and, hence, for chaos (e.g., Kronz 1998).\n \nOne often finds references in the literature to “chaos\ntheory.” For instance, Kellert characterizes chaos theory as\n“the qualitative study of unstable aperiodic behavior in\ndeterministic nonlinear systems” (Kellert 1993, p. 2). In what\nsense is chaos a theory? Is it a theory in the same sense that\nelectrodynamics or quantum mechanics are theories?\n \nAnswering such questions is difficult if for no other reason than that\nthere is no consensus about what a theory is. Scientists often treat\ntheories as systematic bodies of knowledge that provide explanations\nand predictions for actual-world phenomena. But trying to get more\nspecific or precise than this generates significant differences for\nhow to conceptualize theories. Options here range from the axiomatic\nor syntactic view of the logical positivists and empiricists (see\n Vienna Circle)\n to the semantic or model-theoretic view\n(see\n models in science),\n to Kuhnian (see\n Thomas Kuhn) \n and less rigorous conceptions of theories. The axiomatic view of\ntheories appears to be inapplicable to chaos. There are no\naxioms—no laws—no deductive structures, no linking of\nobservational statements to theoretical statements whatsoever in the\nliterature on chaotic dynamics.  \nKellert’s (1993) focus on chaos models is suggestive of the\nsemantic view of theories, and many texts and articles on chaos focus\non models (e.g., logistic map, Henon map, Lorenz attractor). Briefly,\non the semantic view, a theory is characterized by (1) some set of\nmodels and (2) the hypotheses linking these models with idealized\nphysical systems. The mathematical models discussed in the literature\nare concrete and fairly well understood, but what about the hypotheses\nlinking chaos models with idealized physical systems? In the chaos\nliterature, there is a great deal of discussion of various robust or\nuniversal patterns and the kinds of predictions that can and cannot be\nmade using chaotic models. Moreover, there is a lot of emphasis on\nqualitative predictions, geometric “mechanisms” and\npatterns, but this all comes up short of spelling out hypotheses\nlinking chaos models with idealized physical systems.\n \nOne possibility is to look for hypotheses about how such models are\ndeployed when studying actual physical systems. Chaos models seem to be\ndeployed to ascertain various kinds of information about bifurcation\npoints, period doubling sequences, the onset of chaotic dynamics, strange\nattractors and other denizens of the chaos zoo of behaviors. The\nhypotheses connecting chaos models to physical systems would have to be\nfilled in if we are to employ the semantic conception fully. I take it\nthese would be hypotheses about, for example, how strange attractors\nreconstructed from physical data relate to the physical system from\nwhich the data were originally recorded. Or about how a\none-dimensional map for a particular full nonlinear model (idealized\nphysical system) developed using, say, Poincaré surface of\nsection techniques, relates to the target system being modeled.\n \nSuch an approach does seem consistent with the semantic view as\nillustrated with classical mechanics. There we have various models\nsuch as the harmonic oscillator and hypotheses about how these models\napply to idealized physical systems, including specifications of\nspring constants and their identification with mathematical terms in a\nmodel, small oscillation limits, and so forth. But in classical mechanics there\nis a clear association between the models of a theory and the state\nspaces definable over the variables of those models, with a further\nhypothesis about the relationship between the model state space and\nthat of the physical system being modeled (the faithful model\nassumption,\n§1.2.3).\n One can translate between the state spaces and the models and, in the\ncase of classical mechanics, can read the laws off as well (e.g.,\nNewton’s laws of motion are encoded in the possibilities allowed in\nthe state spaces of classical mechanics).  \nUnfortunately, the connection between state spaces, chaotic models\nand laws is less clear. Indeed, there currently are no good candidates for laws\nof chaos over and above the laws of classical mechanics, and some, such as\nKellert, explicitly deny that chaos modeling is getting at laws at all\n(1993, ch. 4). Furthermore, the relationship between the state\nspaces of chaotic models and the spaces of idealized physical systems\nis quite delicate, which seems to be a dissimilarity between classical\nmechanics and “chaos theory.” In the former case, we seem\nto be able to translate between models and state\nspaces.[3] In the\nlatter, we can derive a state space for chaotic models from the full\nnonlinear model, but we cannot reverse the process and get back to the\nnonlinear model state space from that of the chaotic model. One might\nexpect the hypotheses connecting chaos models with idealized physical\nsystems to piggy back on the hypotheses connecting classical mechanics\nmodels with their corresponding idealized physical systems. But it is\nneither clear how this would work in the case of nonlinear systems in\nclassical mechanics, nor how this would work for chaotic models in\nbiology, economics and other \ndisciplines.[4] \nAdditionally, there is another potential problem that arises from\nthinking about the faithful model assumption, namely what is the\nrelationship or mapping between model and target system? Is it\none-to-one as we standardly assume? Or is it a one-to-many relation\n(several different nonlinear models of the same target system or,\npotentially, vice versa) or a many-to-many\n relationship?[5] For many\nclassical mechanics problems—namely, where linear models or\nforce functions are used in Newton’s second law—the\nmapping or translation between model and target system appears to be\nstraightforwardly one-to-one. However, in nonlinear contexts, where one\nmight be constructing a model from a data set generated by observing a\nsystem, there are potentially many nonlinear models that can be\nconstructed, where each model is as empirically adequate to the system\nbehavior as any other. Is there really only one unique model for each\ntarget system and we simply do not know which is the\n“true” one (say, because of underdeterminiation\nproblems—see\n scientific realism)?\n Or is there really no one-to-one relationship between\nour mathematical models and target systems?\n \nMoreover, an important feature of the semantic view is that models\nare only intended to capture the crucial features of target systems\nand always involve various forms of abstraction and idealization (see\n models in science).\n These caveats are potentially deadly in the context of nonlinear\ndynamics. Any errors in our models for such systems, no matter how\naccurate our initial data, will lead to errors in predicting actual\nsystems as these errors will grow (perhaps rapidly) with time. This\nbrings out one of the problems with the faithful model assumption that\nis hidden, so to speak, in the context of linear systems. In the\nlatter context, models can be erroneous by leaving out\n“negligible” factors and, at least for reasonable times,\nour model predictions do not differ significantly with the target\nsystems we are modeling (wait long enough, however, and such\npredictions will differ significantly). In nonlinear contexts, by\ncontrast, it is not so clear there are any “negligible” factors. Even the\nsmallest omission in a nonlinear model can lead to disastrous effects\nbecause the differences these terms would have made versus their\nabsence potentially can be rapidly amplified as the model evolves (see\n §3).\n \nAnother possibility is to drop hypotheses connecting models with\ntarget systems and simply focus on the defining models of the semantic\nview of theories. This is very much the spirit of the mathematical\ntheory of dynamical systems. There the focus is on models and their\nrelations, but there is no emphasis on hypotheses connecting these\nmodels with actual systems, idealized or otherwise. Unfortunately,\nthis would mean that chaos theory would be only a mathematical theory\nand not a physical one.\n \nBoth the syntactic and semantic views of theories focus on the\nformal structure of theoretical bodies, and their “fit”\nwith theorizing about chaotic dynamics seems quite problematic. In\ncontrast, perhaps one should conceive of chaos theory in a more\ninformal or paradigmatic way, say along the lines of Kuhn’s (1996) analysis of\nscientific paradigms. There is no emphasis on the precise structure of\nscientific theories in Kuhn’s picture of science. Rather,\ntheories are cohesive, systematic bodies of knowledge defined mainly by\nthe roles they play in normal science practice within a dominant\nparadigm. There is a very strong sense in literature about chaos that a\n“new paradigm” has emerged out of chaos research with its\nemphasis on unstable rather than stable behavior, on dynamical\npatterns rather than on mechanisms, on universal features (e.g.,\nFeigenbaum’s number) rather than laws, and on qualitative\nunderstanding rather than on precise prediction. Whether or not chaotic\ndynamics represents a genuine scientific paradigm, the use of the term\n‘chaos theory’ in much of the scientific and philosophical\nliterature has the definite flavor of characterizing and understanding\ncomplex behavior rather than an emphasis on the formal structure of\nprinciples and hypotheses.\n \nGiven a target system to be modeled, and invoking the faithful model\nassumption, there are two basic approaches to model confirmation\ndiscussed in the philosophical literature on modeling following a\nstrategy known as piecemeal improvement (I will ignore bootstrapping\napproaches as they suffer similar problems, but only complicate the\ndiscussion). These piecemeal strategies are also found in the work of\nscientists modeling actual-world systems and represent competing\napproaches vying for government funding (for an early discussion, see\nThompson 1957).\n \nThe first basic approach is to focus on successive refinements to\nthe accuracy of the initial data used by the model while keeping the\nmodel itself fixed (e.g., Laymon 1989, p. 359). The idea here is that\nif a model is faithful in reproducing the behavior of the target system\nto some degree, refining the precision of the initial data fed to the\nmodel will lead to its behavior monotonically converging to the target\nsystem’s behavior. This is to say that as the uncertainty in the\ninitial data is reduced, a faithful model’s behavior is expected\nto converge to the target system’s behavior. The import of the\nfaithful model assumption is that if one were to plot the trajectory of\nthe target system in an appropriate state space, the model trajectory\nin the same state space would monotonically become more like the system\ntrajectory on some measure as the data is refined (I will ignore\ndifficulties regarding appropriate measures for discerning similarity\nin trajectories; see Smith 2000).\n \nThe second basic approach is to focus on successive refinements of\nthe model while keeping the initial data fixed (e.g., Wimsatt 1987).\nThe idea here is that if a model is faithful in reproducing the\nbehavior of the target system, refining the model will produce an even\nbetter fit with the target system’s behavior. This is to say that\nif a model is faithful, successive improvements will lead to its\nbehavior monotonically converging to the target system’s\nbehavior. Again, the import of the faithful model assumption is that if\none were to plot the trajectory of the target system in an appropriate\nstate space, the model trajectory in the same state space would\nmonotonically become more like the system trajectory as the model is\nmade more realistic.\n \nWhat both of these basic approaches have in common is that piecemeal\nmonotonic convergence of model behavior to target system behavior is a\nmark for confirmation of the model (Koperski 1998). By either improving\nthe quality of the initial data or improving the quality of the model,\nthe model in question reproduces the target system’s behavior\nmonotonically better and yields predictions of the future states of the\ntarget system that show monotonically less deviation with respect to\nthe behavior of the target system. In this sense, monotonic convergence\nto the behavior of the target system is a key criterion for whether the\nmodel is confirmed. If monotonic convergence to the target system\nbehavior is not found by pursuing either of these basic approaches,\nthen the model is considered to be disconfirmed.\n \nFor linear models it is easy to see the intuitive appeal of such\npiecemeal strategies. After all, for linear systems of equations a\nsmall change in the magnitude of a variable is guaranteed to yield a\nproportional change in the output of the model. So by making piecemeal\nrefinements to the initial data or to the linear model only\nproportional changes in model output are expected. If the linear model\nis faithful, then making small improvements “in the right\ndirection” in either the initial data or the model itself can be\ntracked by improved model performance. The qualifier “in the\nright direction,” drawing upon the faithful model assumption,\nmeans that the data quality really is increased or that the model\nreally is more realistic (captures more features of the target system\nin an increasingly accurate way), and is signified by the model’s\nmonotonically improved performance with respect to the target\nsystem.\n \nHowever, both of these basic approaches to confirming models\nencounter serious difficulties when applied to nonlinear models, where\nthe principle of linear superposition no longer holds. In the first\napproach, successive small refinements in the initial data used by\nnonlinear models is not guaranteed to lead to any convergence between\nmodel behavior and target system behavior. Any small refinements in\ninitial data can lead to non-proportional changes in model behavior\nrendering this piecemeal convergence strategy ineffective as a means\nfor confirming the model. A refinement of the quality of the data\n“in the right direction” is not guaranteed to lead to a\nnonlinear model monotonically improving in capturing the target\nsystem’s behavior. The small refinement in data quality may very\nwell lead to the model behavior diverging away from the\nsystem’s\n behavior.[6] \nIn the second approach, keeping the data fixed but making successive\nrefinements in nonlinear models is also not guaranteed to lead to any\nconvergence between model behavior and target system behavior. With the\nloss of linear superposition, any small changes in the model can lead\nto non-proportional changes in model behavior again rendering the\nconvergence strategy ineffective as a means for confirming the model.\nEven if a small refinement to the model is made “in the right\ndirection,” there is no guarantee that the nonlinear model will\nmonotonically improve in capturing the target system’s behavior.\nThe small refinement in the model may very well lead to the model\nbehavior diverging away from the system’s behavior.\n \nSo whereas for linear models piecemeal strategies might be expected\nto lead to better confirmed models (presuming the target system\nexhibits only stable linear behavior), no such expectation is justified\nfor nonlinear models deployed in the characterization of nonlinear\ntarget systems. Even for a faithful nonlinear model, the smallest\nchanges in either the initial data or the model itself may result in\nnon-proportional changes in model output, an output that is not\nguaranteed to “move in the right direction” even if the\nsmall changes are made “in the right direction” (of course,\nthis lack of guarantee of monotonic improvement also raises questions\nabout what “in the right direction” means, but I will\nignore these difficulties here).\n \n Intuitively, piecemeal convergence strategies look to be dependent\non the perfect model scenario. Given a perfect model, refining the\nquality of the data should lead to monotonic convergence of the model\nbehavior to the target system’s behavior, but even this expectation is\nnot always justifiable for perfect models (cf. Judd and Smith 2001;\nSmith 2003). On the other hand, given good data, perfecting a model\nintuitively should also lead to monotonic convergence of the model\nbehavior to the target system’s behavior. By making small changes to a\nnonlinear model, hopefully based on improved understanding of relevant\nfeatures of the target system (e.g., the physics of weather systems or\nthe structures of economies), there is no guarantee that such changes\nwill produce monotonic improvement in the model’s performance with\nrespect to the target system’s behavior. The loss of linear\nsuperposition, then, leads to a similar lack of guarantee of a\ncontinuous path of improvement as the lack of guarantee of piecemeal\nconfirmation. And without such a guaranteed path of improvement, there\nis no guarantee that a faithful nonlinear model can be perfected by piecemeal means.\n \nOf course, we do not have perfect models. But even if we did, they are\nunlikely to live up to our intuitions about them (Judd and Smith 2001;\nJudd and Smith 2004). For example, no matter how many observations of\na system are made, there still will be a set of trajectories in the\nmodel state space that are indistinguishable from the actual\ntrajectory of the target system. Indeed, even for infinite past\nobservations, we cannot eliminate the uncertainty in the epistemic\nstates given some unknown ontological state of the target system. One\nimportant reason for this difficulty follows from the faithful model\nassumption. Suppose the nonlinear model state space is a faithful\nrepresentation of the possibilities lying in the physical space of the\ntarget system. No matter how fine-grained we make our model state\nspace, it will still be the case that there are many different states\nof the actual target system (ontological states) that are mappable\ninto the same state of the model state space (epistemic states). This\nmeans that there will always be many more target system states than\nthere are model states for any computational models since the\nequations have to be discretized. In principle, in those cases where\nwe can develop a fully analytical model, we could get an exact match\nbetween the number of possible model states and the number of target\nsystem states. However, such analytical models are rare in complexity\nstudies (many of the analytical models are toy models, like the\nbaker’s map, which, while illustrative of techniques, are\nmisleading when it comes to metaphysical and ontological conclusions\ndue to their simplicity).\n \nTherefore, whether there is a perfect model or not for a target\nsystem, there is no guarantee of monotonic improvement with respect to\nthe target system’s behavior. Traditional piecemeal confirmation\nstrategies fail. This is the upshot of the failure of the principle of\nlinear superposition. No matter how faithful the model, no guarantee\nof piecemeal monotonic improvement of a nonlinear model’s behavior\nwith respect to the target system can be made (of course, if one waits\nfor long enough times piecemeal confirmation strategies will also fail\nfor linear systems). Furthermore, problems with these confirmation\nstrategies will arise whether one is seeking to model point-valued\ntrajectories in state space or one is using probability densities\ndefined on state space.\n \nOne possible response to the piecemeal confirmation problems\ndiscussed here is to turn to a Bayesian framework for confirmation, but\nsimilar problems arise here for nonlinear models. Given that there are\nno perfect models in the model class to which we would apply a Bayesian\nscheme and given the fact that imperfect models will fail to reproduce\nor predict target system behavior over time scales that may be short\ncompared to our interests, there again is no guarantee that monotonic\nimprovement can be achieved for our nonlinear models (I leave aside the\nproblem that having no perfect model in our model class renders many\nBayesian confirmation schemes ill-defined).\n \nFor nonlinear models, faithfulness can fail and piecemeal\nperfectibility cannot be guaranteed, raising questions about\nscientific modeling practices and our understanding of them. However,\nthe implications of the loss of linear superposition reach father than\nthis. Policy assessment often utilizes model forecasts and if the\nmodels and systems lying at the core of policy deliberations are\nnonlinear, then policy assessment will be affected by the same lack of\nguarantee as model confirmation. Suppose administrators are using a\nnonlinear model in the formulation of economic policies designed to\nkeep GDP ever increasing while minimizing unemployment (among\nachieving other socio-economic goals). While it is true that there\nwill be some uncertainty generated by running the model several times\nover slightly different data sets, assume that policies taking these\nuncertainties into account to some degree can be fashioned. Once in\nplace, the policies need assessment regarding their effectiveness and\npotential adverse effects, but such assessment will not involve merely\nlooking at monthly or quarterly reports on GDP and employment data to\nsee if targets are being met. The nonlinear economic model driving the\npolicy decisions will need to be rerun to check if trends are indeed\nmoving “in the right direction” with respect to the\nearlier forecasts. But, of course, data for the model now has changed\nand there is no guarantee that the model will produce a forecast with\nthis new data that fits well with the old forecasts used to craft the\noriginal policies. Nor is there a guarantee of any fit between the new\nruns of the nonlinear model and the economic data being gathered as\npart of ongoing monitoring of the economic policies. How, then, are\npolicy makers to make reliable assessments of policies? The same\nproblem—that small changes in data or model in nonlinear\ncontexts are not guaranteed to yield proportionate model outputs or\nmonotonically improved model performance—also plagues policy\nassessment using nonlinear models. Such problems remain largely\nunexplored.\n \nOne of the exciting features of SDIC is that there is no lower limit\non just how small some change or perturbation can be—the\nsmallest of effects will eventually be amplified up affecting the\nbehavior of any system exhibiting SDIC. A number of authors have\nargued that chaos through SDIC opens a door for quantum mechanics to\n“infect” chaotic classical mechanics systems (e.g.,\nHobbs 1991; Barone et al. 1993; Kellert 1993; Bishop 2008). [7] \nThe essential point is that the nature of\nparticular kinds of nonlinear dynamics—those which exhibit\nstretching and folding (confinement) of trajectories, where there are\nno trajectory crossings, and which exhibit aperiodic\norbits—apparently open the door for quantum effects to change\nthe behavior of chaotic macroscopic systems. The central argument runs\nas follows and is known as the sensitive dependence argument (SD\nargument for short):\n \nPremise (A) makes clear that SD is the operative definition for\ncharacterizing chaotic behavior in this argument, invoking exponential\ngrowth characterized by the largest global Lyapunov exponent. Premise\n(B) expresses the precision limit for the state of minimum uncertainty\nfor momentum and position pairs in an \\(N\\)-dimensional quantum\nsystem (note, the exponent is \\(2N\\) in the case of uncorrelated\nelectrons).[8] The\nconclusion of the argument in the form given here is actually stronger\nthan that quantum mechanics can influence a macroscopic system\nexhibiting SDIC; determinism fails for such systems because of such\ninfluences. Briefly, the reasoning runs as follows. Because of SDIC,\nnonlinear chaotic systems whose initial states can be located only\nwithin a small neighborhood \\(\\varepsilon\\) of state space will have future\nstates that can be located only within a much larger patch\n\\(\\delta\\). For example, two isomorphic nonlinear systems of classical\nmechanics exhibiting SDIC, whose initial states are localized within\n\\(\\varepsilon\\), will have future states that can be localized only within\n\\(\\delta\\). Since quantum mechanics sets a lower bound on the size of the\npatch of initial conditions, unique evolution must fail for nonlinear\nchaotic systems.\n \nThe SD argument does not go through as smoothly as some of its\nadvocates have thought, however. There are difficult issues regarding\nthe appropriate version of quantum mechanics (e.g., von\nNeumann, Bohmian or decoherence theories; see entries\nunder\n quantum mechanics),\n the nature of quantum measurement theory (collapse vs. non-collapse\ntheories; see the section on the measurement problem in \nthe entry on \n philosophical issues in quantum theory),\nand the selection of the initial state characterizing the system that\nmust be resolved before one can say clearly whether or not unique\nevolution is violated. For instance, just because\nquantum effects might influence macroscopic chaotic systems doesn’t\nguarantee that determinism fails for such systems. Whether quantum\ninteractions with nonlinear macroscopic systems exhibiting SDIC\ncontribute indeterministically to the outcomes of such\nsystems depends on the currently undecidable question of indeterminism\nin quantum mechanics and the measurement problem as well as on how one\nchooses to the system-measurement apparatus cut (Bishop 2008).  \nTo expand on one issue, there is a serious open question as to whether\nthe indeterminism in quantum mechanics is simply the result of\nignorance due to epistemic limitations or if it is an ontological\nfeature of the quantum world. Suppose that quantum mechanics is\nultimately deterministic, but that there is some additional factor, a\nhidden variable as it is often called, such that if this variable were\navailable to us, our description of quantum systems would be fully\ndeterministic. Another possibility is that there is an interaction\nwith the broader environment that accounts for how the probabilities\nin quantum mechanics arise (physicists call this approach\n“decoherence”). Under either of these possibilities, we\nwould interpret the indeterminism observed in quantum mechanics as an\nexpression of our ignorance, and, hence, indeterminism would not be a\nfundamental feature of the quantum domain. It would be merely\nepistemic in nature due to our lack of knowledge or access to\nquantum systems. So if the indeterminism in QM is not ontologically\ngenuine, then whatever contribution quantum effects make to macroscopic\nsystems exhibiting SDIC would not violate unique evolution. In\ncontrast, suppose it is the case that quantum mechanics is genuinely\nindeterministic; that is, all the relevant factors of quantum systems\ndo not fully determine their behavior at any given moment. Then the\npossibility exists that not all physical systems traditionally thought\nto be in the domain of classical mechanics can be described using\nstrictly deterministic models, leading to the need to approach the\nmodeling of such nonlinear systems differently.\n \nMoreover, the possible constraints of nonlinear classical mechanics\nsystems on the amplification of quantum effects must be considered on\na case-by-case basis. For instance, damping due to friction can place\nconstraints on how quickly amplification of quantum effects can take\nplace before they are completely washed out (Bishop 2008). And\none has to investigate the local finite-time dynamics for each system\nbecause these may not yield any on-average growth in uncertainties\n(e.g., Smith, Ziehmann, Fraedrich 1999).\n \nIn summary, there is no abstract, a priori reasoning establishing\nthe truth of the SD argument; the argument can only be demonstrated on a\ncase-by-case basis. Perhaps detailed examination of several cases would\nenable us to make some generalizations about how wide spread the\npossibilities for the amplification of quantum effects are.\n \nTwo traditional topics in philosophy of science are realism and\nexplanation. Although not well explored in the context of chaos, there\nare interesting questions regarding both topics deserving of\nfurther exploration.\n \nChaos raises a number of questions about scientific realism (see\nscientific realism)\n only some of which will be touched on here. First and foremost,\nscientific realism is usually formulated as a thesis about the status\nof unobservable terms in scientific theories and their relationship to\nentities, events and processes in the actual world. In other words,\ntheories make various claims about features of the world and these\nclaims are at least approximately true. But as we saw in\n §2,\n there are serious questions about formulating a theory of chaos, let\nalone determining how this theory fares under scientific realism. It\nseems more reasonable, then, to discuss some less ambitious realist\nquestions regarding chaos: Is chaos an actual phenomenon? Do the various\ndenizens of chaos, like fractals, actually exist?  \nThis leads us back to the faithful model assumption\n (§1.2.3).\n Recall this assumption maintains that our model equations faithfully\ncapture target system behavior and that the model state space\nfaithfully represents the actual possibilities of the target\nsystem. Is the sense of faithfulness here that of actual\ncorrespondence between mathematical models and features of actual\nsystems? Or can faithfulness be understood in terms of empirical\nadequacy alone, a primarily instrumentalist construal of faithfulness?\nIs a realist construal of faithfulness threatened by the mapping\nbetween models and systems potentially being one-to-many or\nmany-to-many?  \nA related question is whether or not our mathematical models are\nsimulating target systems or merely mimicking their behavior. To be\nsimulating a system suggests that there is some actual correspondence\nbetween the model and the target system it is designed to capture. On\nthe other hand, if a mathematical model is merely mimicking the\nbehavior of a target system, there is no guarantee that the model has\nany genuine correspondence to the actual properties of the target\nsystem. The model merely imitates behavior. These issues become crucial\nfor modern techniques of building nonlinear dynamical models from large\ntime series data sets (e.g., Smith 1992), for example the sunspot\nrecord or the daily closing value of a particular stock for some\nspecific period of time. In such cases, after performing some tests on\nthe data set, the modeler sets to work constructing a mathematical\nmodel that reproduces the time series as its output. Do such models\nonly mimic behavior of target systems? Where does realism come into the\npicture?\n \nA further question regarding chaos and realism is the following: Is\nchaos only a feature of our mathematical models or is it a genuine\nfeature of actual systems in our world? This question is well\nillustrated by a peculiar geometric structure of dissipative chaotic\nmodels called a strange attractor, which can form based upon\nthe stretching and folding of trajectories in state space. Strange\nattractors normally only occupy a subregion of state space, but once a\ntrajectory wanders close enough to the attractor, it is caught near the\nsurface of the attractor for the rest of its future.\n \nOne of the characteristic features of strange attractors is that\nthey posses self-similar structure. Magnify any small\nportion of the attractor and you would find that the magnified portion\nwould look identical to the regular-sized region. Magnify\nthe magnified region and you would see the identical structure repeated\nagain. Continuous repetition of this process would yield the same\nresults. The self-similar structure is repeated on arbitrarily\nsmall scales. An important geometric implication of\nself-similarity is that there is no inherent size scale so\nthat we can take as large a magnification of as small a region of the\nattractor as we want and a statistically similarly structure will be\nrepeated (Hilborn 1994, p. 56). In other words, strange attractors for\nchaotic models have an infinite number of layers of repetitive\nstructure. This type of structure allows trajectories to remain\nwithin a bounded region of state space by folding and intertwining with\none another without ever intersecting or repeating themselves\nexactly.\n \nStrange attractors also are often characterized as possess noninteger\nor fractal dimension (though not all strange attractors have\nsuch dimensionality). The type of dimensionality we usually meet in\nphysics as well as in everyday experience is characterized by\nintegers. A point has dimension zero; a line has dimension one; a\nsquare has dimension two; a cube has dimension three and so on. As a\ngeneralization of our intuitions regarding dimensionality, consider a\nlarge square. Suppose we fill this large square with smaller squares\neach having an edge length of \\(\\varepsilon\\). The number of small squares\nneeded to completely fill the space inside the large square\nis \\(N(\\varepsilon)\\). Now repeat this process of filling the large\nsquare with small squares, but each time let the length \\(\\varepsilon\\) get\nsmaller and smaller. In the limit as \\(\\varepsilon\\) approached zero, we\nwould find that the ratio\n\\(\\ln N(\\varepsilon)/\\ln(1 / \\varepsilon)\\) equals two\njust as we would expect for a 2-dimensional square. You can imagine\nthe same exercise of filling a large 3-dimensional cube (a room, say)\nwith smaller cubes and in the limit of \\(\\varepsilon\\) approaching zero, we\nwould arrive at a dimension of three.\n \nWhen we apply this generalization of dimensionality to the geometric\nstructure of strange attractors, we often find noninteger\ndimensionality. Roughly this means that if we try to apply the same\nprocedure of “filling” the structure formed by the strange\nattractor with small squares or cubes, in the limit as \\(\\varepsilon\\)\napproaches zero the result is noninteger. Whether one is examining a\nset of nonlinear mathematical equations or analyzing the time series\ndata from an experiment, the presence of self-similarity or noninteger\ndimension are indications that the chaotic behavior of the system\nunder study is dissipative (nonconservative, doesn’t conserve energy)\nrather than Hamiltonian (does conservative energy).\n \nAlthough there is no universally accepted definition for strange\nattractors or fractal dimension among mathematicians, the more serious\nquestion is whether strange attractors and fractal dimensions are\nproperties of our models only or also of actual-world systems. For\ninstance, empirical investigations of a number of actual-world systems\nindicate that there is no infinitely repeating self-similar structure\nlike that of strange attractors (Avnir, et al. 1998; see also\nShenker 1994). At most, one finds self-similar structure repeated on\ntwo or three spatial scales in the reconstructed state space and that\nis it. This appears to be more like a prefractal, where\nself-similar structure exists on only a finite number of length\nscales. That is to say, prefractals repeat their structure under\nmagnification only a finite number of times rather than infinitely as\nin the case of a fractal. So this seems to indicate that there are no\ngenuine strange attractors with fractal dimension in actual systems, but\npossibly only attractors having prefractal geometries with\nself-similarity on a limited number of spatial scales.\n \nOn the other hand, the dissipative chaotic models used to\ncharacterize some actual-world systems all exhibit strange attractors\nwith fractal geometries. So it looks like fractal geometries in chaotic\nmodel state spaces bear no relationship to the pre-fractal features of\nactual-world systems. In other words, these fractal features of many of\nour models are clearly false of the target systems though the models\nthemselves may still be useful for helping scientists locate interesting\ndynamics of target systems characterized by prefractal properties.\nScientific realism and usefulness look to part ways here. At least many\nof the strange attractors of our models play the role of useful\nfictions.\n \n There are caveats to this line of thinking, however. First, the\nprefractal character of the analyzed data sets (e.g. by\nAvnir, et al. 1998) could be an artifact of the way data is\nmassaged before it is analyzed or due to the analog-to-digital\nconversion that must take place before data analysis can\nbegin. Reducing real number valued data to a finite string of would destroy\nfractal structure. If so, the infinitely self-similar structures of\nfractals in our models might not be such a bad approximation after\nall.  \nA different reason, though, to suspect that physical systems cannot\nhave such self-repeating structures “all the way down” is\nthat at some point the classical world gives way to the quantum world,\nwhere things change so drastically that there cannot be a strange\nattractor because the state space changes. Hence, we are applying a\nmodel carrying a tremendous amount of excess, fictitious structure to\nunderstand features of physical systems. This looks like a problem\nbecause one of the key structures playing a crucial role in chaos\nexplanations—the infinitely intricate structure of the strange\nattractor—would then be absent from the corresponding physical system.\n \nAccording to Peter Smith (1998, ch. 3), one might be justified in\nemploying obviously false chaos models because the infinitely\nintricate structure of strange attractors (1) is the result of\nrelatively simple stretching and folding mechanisms and (2) many of\nthe points in state space of interest are invariant under this\nstretching and folding mechanism. These features represent kinds of\nsimplicity that can be had at the (perhaps exorbitant!) cost of\nfictitious infinite structure. The strange attractor exhibits this\nstructure and the attractor is a sign of some stretching and folding\nprocess. The infinite structure is merely geometric extra baggage, but\nthe robust properties like period-doubling sequences, onset of chaos,\nand so forth are real enough. This has the definite flavor of being\nantirealist about some key elements of explanation in chaos\n (§5.2)\n and has been criticized as such (Koperski 2001).\n \nInstead of trying to squeeze chaos into scientific realism’s\nmold, then, perhaps it is better to turn to an alternative account of\nrealism, structural realism.\n Roughly, the\nidea is that realism in scientific practices hinges on the structural\nrelations of phenomena. So structural realism tends to focus on the\ncausal structures in well-confirmed scientific hypotheses and theories.\nThe kinds of universal structural features identified in chaotic\nphenomena in realms as diverse as physics, biology and economics is\nvery suggestive of some form of structural realism and, indeed, look to\nplay key roles in chaos explanations (see below). Though, again, there\nare significant worries that infinitely repeating self-similar\nstructure might not be realized in physical systems. On a structural\napproach to realism regarding chaos models, one faces the difficulty\nthat strange attractors are at best too gross an approximation to the\nstructure of physical attractors and at worst terribly misleading.\n \nPerhaps other kinds of geometric structures associated with chaos\nwould qualify on a structural realist view. After all, it also seems to\nbe the case that realism for chaos models has more to do with\nprocesses—namely stretching and folding mechanisms at work in\ntarget systems. But here the connection with realism and chaos models\nwould come indirectly via an appeal to the causal processes at work in\nthe full nonlinear models taken to represent physical systems. Perhaps\nthe fractal character of strange attractors is an artifact introduced\nthrough the various idealizations and approximations used to derive\nsuch chaotic models. If so, then perhaps there is another way to arrive\nat more realistic chaos models that have prefractal attractors.\n \nChaos has been invoked as an explanation for, or as contributing\nsubstantially to explanations of, actual-world behaviors. Some examples\nare epileptic seizures, heart fibrillation, neural processes, chemical\nreactions, weather, industrial control processes and even forms of\nmessage encryption. Aside from irregular behavior of actual-world\nsystems, chaos is also invoked to explain features such as the actual\ntrajectories exhibited in a given state space or the sojourn times of\ntrajectories in particular regions of state space. But what, exactly,\nis the role chaos plays in these various explanations? More succinctly,\nwhat are chaos explanations?\n \nThe nature of scientific explanation (see the entry on \n scientific explanation)\n in the literature on chaos is thoroughly under-discussed to put\nit mildly. Traditional accounts for scientific explanation such as\ncovering-law, causal mechanical and unification models all present\nvarious kinds of drawbacks when applied to chaotic phenomena. For\ninstance, if there are no universal laws lying at the heart of chaos\nexplanations—and it does not seem credible that such laws could\nreally play a role in chaos explanations—covering-law models do\nnot look promising as candidates for chaos explanations.\n \nRoughly speaking, the causal-mechanical model of explanation\nmaintains that science provides understanding of diverse facts and\nevents by showing how these fit into the causal structure of the world.\nIf chaos is a behavior exhibited by nonlinear systems (mathematical and\nphysical), then it seems reasonable to think that there might be some\nmechanisms or processes standing behind this behavior. After all, chaos\nis typically understood to be a property of the dynamics of such\nsystems, and dynamics often reflects the processes at work\nand their interactions. The links between causal mechanisms and\nbehaviors in the causal-mechanical model are supposed to be reliable\nlinks along the following lines: If mechanism \\(C\\) is present, behavior\n\\(B\\) typically follows. In this sense, chaos explanations,\nunderstood on the causal-mechanical model, are envisioned as providing\nreliable connections between mechanisms and the chaotic behavior\nexhibited by systems containing such mechanisms.\n \nOn the other hand, the basic idea of unification accounts of\nexplanation is that science provides understanding of diverse facts and\nevents by showing how these may be unified by a much smaller set of\nfactors (e.g., laws or causes). Perhaps one can argue\nthat chaos is a domain or set of a limited number of patterns and tools\nfor explaining/understanding a set of characteristic behaviors found in\ndiverse phenomena spread across physics, chemistry, biology, economics,\nsocial psychology, and so forth. In this sense the set of patterns or\nstructures (e.g., “stretching and folding”) might make up\nthe explanatory store unifying our understanding of all the diverse\nphenomena behaving chaotically.\n \nBoth causal and unification accounts, as typically conceived, assume\nthat theories are in place and that the models of those theories play\nsome role in explanation. In causal accounts, causal processes are key\ncomponents of the models. In unification accounts, laws might be the\nultimate explanatory factors, but we often connect laws with physical\nsystems via models. To be explanatory, however, such accounts must make\nthe faithful model assumption; namely, that our models (and their state\nspaces) are faithful in what they say about actual systems.\n \nRecall that SD—exponential divergence of neighboring\ntrajectories—is taken by many to be a necessary condition for\nchaos. As we saw in\n §3,\n it is not straightforward to confirm when we have a\nmodel serving as a good explanation because, for instance, the\nslightest refinement of initial conditions can lead to wildly\ndiffering behavior. So on many standard approaches to confirmation and\nmodels, it would be difficult to say when we had a good\nexplanation. Even if we push the faithful model assumption to its\nextreme limit—i.e., assuming the model is perfect—we run\ninto tricky questions regarding confirmation since there are too many\nstates indistinguishable from the actual state of the system yielding\nempirically indistinguishable trajectories in the model state space\n(Judd and Smith 2001).  \nPerhaps with chaos explanation we should either search for a process\nyielding the “stretching and folding” in the dynamics\n(causal form of explanation) or we should search for the common\nproperties such behavior exhibits (unification form of explanation)\nunderlying the behavior of the nonlinear systems of interest. In other\nwords, we want to be able to understand why systems exhibit SDIC,\naperiodicity, randomness, and so forth. But these are the properties\ncharacterizing chaotic behavior, so the unification account of\nexplanation sounds like it may ultimately involve appealing to the\nproperties in need of explanation.\n \nThe explanatory picture becomes more complicated by shifting away\nfrom SD as characterized by a positive global Lyapunov exponent and\nsettling for what may be more realistic, namely the effects of\ndivergence/contraction characterized by finite-time Lyapunov exponents.\nHowever, even in this case, it appears that the properties to which one\nappeals on a unification account pick out the patterns of chaos that we\nwant to understand: How do these properties arise? It seems that\nunification accounts are still at a disadvantage in characterizing\nchaos explanations.\n \nSuppose we appealed to strange attractors in our models or in state\nspace reconstruction techniques. Would this be evidence that there is\na strange attractor in the target system’s behavior? Modulo\nworries raised in\n §5.1,\n even if the presence of a strange attractor in the state space was\nboth a necessary and sufficient condition for the model being chaotic,\nthis would not amount to an explanation of chaotic behavior in the\ntarget system. First, the strange attractor is an object in state\nspace, which is not the same as saying that the actual system behaves\nas if there is a strange attractor in the physical space of its\nactivity. A trajectory in a state space is a way of gaining useful\ninformation about the target system (via the faithful model\nassumption), but it is different from trajectories developed by\nlooking at how an actual system’s properties change with respect to time. Just\nbecause a trajectory of a system in state space is spiraling ever\ncloser to the strange attractor does not imply that the target\nsystem’s behavior in physical space is somehow approaching that\nattractor (except possibly under the perfect model scenario). Second,\nbut related, the presence of a strange attractor would only be a mark\nof chaos, not an explanation for why chaotic properties are being\nexhibited by a system. It seems we still need to appeal to processes\nand interactions causing the dynamics to have the characteristic\nproperties we associate with chaos.  \nAt this point, a question implied at the end of the previous\nsubsection arises, namely what is effecting the unification in chaos\nexplanations? Unification models of explanation typically posit an\nexplanatory store of a relatively small number of laws or mechanisms\nthat serve to explain or unify a diverse set of phenomena. A standard\nexample is that of Newtonian mechanics providing a small set of\nprinciples that could serve to explain phenomena as diverse as projectile\nmotions, falling bodies, tides, planetary orbits and pendula. In this\nway, we say that Newtonian mechanics unified a diverse set of phenomena\nby showing that they all were governed by a small set of physical\nprinciples. Now, if a unification construal of chaos explanations only\nfocuses on the mathematical similarities in behaviors of diverse\nphenomena (e.g., period doubling route to chaos or SDIC), then one can\nlegitimately question whether the relevant sense of unification is in\nplay in chaos explanations. The “explanatory store” of\nchaos explanations is indeed a small set of mathematical and\ngeometrical features, but is this the wrong store (compare with the\nphysical principles of Newtonian mechanics)? However, if unification is\nsupposed to be achieved through underlying mechanisms producing these\nmathematical and geometrical features, then the explanatory store\nappears to be very large and heterogeneous—the mechanisms in\nphysics are different from those in biology, are different from those\nin ecology, are different from those in economics are different from\nthose in social psychology…Once again, the causal-mechanical model\nappears to make more sense for characterizing the nature of chaos\nexplanations.\n \nIf this were all there was to the story of chaos explanations, then\na causal account of explanation looks more promising. But it would also\nbe the case that there is nothing special about such explanations:\nThere are processes and interactions that cause the dynamics to have\nchaotic properties. But Stephen Kellert (1993, ch. 4) maintains that\nthere is something new about chaotic dynamics, forcing us to rethink\nexplanation when it comes to chaos models. His proposal for chaos\nexplanations as yielding qualitative understanding of system behavior\nsuggests that causal accounts, at least, do not fit well with what is\ngoing on in chaos research.\n \nKellert first focuses on one of the key intuitions driving many\nviews in debates on scientific explanation: Namely, that the sciences\nprovide understanding or insight into phenomena. Chaos explanations,\naccording to Kellert, achieve understanding by constructing,\nelaborating and applying simple dynamical models. He gives three points\nof contrast between this approach to understanding and what he takes to\nbe the standard approach to understanding in the sciences. The first is\nthat chaos explanations involve models that are holistic\nrather than microreductionist. Models of the latter type seek to break\nsystems down into their constituent parts and look for law-like\nrelations among the parts. In contrast, many of the mathematical tools\nof chaotic dynamics are holistic in that they extract or reveal\ninformation about the behavior of the model system as a whole not\nreadily apparent from the nonlinear equations of the model themselves.\nMethods such as state space reconstruction and sections-of-surface can\nreveal information implicit in the nonlinear equations. Developing one-\nand two-dimensional maps from the model equations can also provide this\nkind of information directly, and are much simpler than the full model\nequations.\n \nWhereas the first point of contrast is drawn from the practice of\nphysics, the second is logical. After reducing the system to its\nparts, the next step in the standard approach to understanding,\naccording to Kellert, is to construct a “deductive scheme, which\nyields a rigorous proof of the necessity (or expectability) of the\nsituation at hand” (1993, p. 91). What Kellert is\nreferring to, here, is the deductive-nomological account of\nexplanation (see Section 2 of the entry on\n scientific explanation,\non the DN model). The approach in chaotic dynamics makes\nno use of deductive inferences. Specifically, instead of looking at\nbasic principles, propositions, and so on, and making deductive\ninferences, chaos explanations appeal to computer simulations because\nof the difficulty or even impossibility of deducing the chaotic\nbehavior of the system from the model equations (e.g., no proof of SD\nfor the Lorenz model based on the governing equations).\n \nThe third point of contrast is historical. In contexts where linear\nsuperposition holds, a full specification of the instantaneous state\nplus the equations of motion yield all the information about the\nsystem there is to know (e.g., pendulum and projectile\nmotion). Although a full specification of such states is impossible,\nvery small errors in specifying such states lead to very small\ndeviations between model and target system behaviors, at least for\nshort times and good models. By contrast, in nonlinear contexts, where\nlinear superposition fails, a full specification of an instantaneous\nstate of the system plus the equations of motion does not yield all\nthe information there is about the system, for example, if there are\nmemory effects (hysteresis), or the act of measurements introducing\ndisturbances that SDIC can amplify. In the former case, we also need to know the\nhistory of the system as well (whether it started out below the\ncritical point or above the critical point, say). So chaos\nexplanations must also take model histories into account.\n \nWhat kind of understanding is achieved in chaos explanations?\nKellert argues we get (1) predictions of qualitative behavior rather\nthan quantitative detail, (2) geometric mechanisms rather than causal\nprocesses, and (3) patterns rather than law-like necessity.\n \nRegarding (1), detailed predictions regarding individual\ntrajectories fail rather rapidly for chaotic models when there is any\nerror in specification of the initial state. So, says Kellert, instead\nwe predict global behaviors of models and have an account of limited\npredictability in chaotic models. But many of these behaviors can be\nprecisely predicted (e.g., control parameter\n values[9]\n at which various bifurcations occur, the onset of chaos, the return\nof n-periodic orbits). (1) amounts to important, but limited\ninsight. On this view we are able to predict when to expect\nqualitative features of the nonlinear dynamics to undergo a sudden\nchange, but chaos models do not yield precise values of system\nvariables. We get the latter values by running full-blow computer\nsimulations on the full nonlinear model equations, provided the\ndegrees of freedom are reasonable. In this sense, chaos explanations\nare complimentary to the full model simulation because the former can\ntell us when/where to expect dynamical changes such as the onset of\ncomplicated dynamics in the latter.  \nRegarding (2), chaos explanation is not a species of causal\nexplanation. That is to say, chaos explanations do not focus on or\nreveal processes and interactions giving rise to the dynamics; rather,\nthey reveal large-scale geometric features of the dynamics. Kellert\nargues the kinds of mechanisms on which chaos explanations focus are\nnot causal, but geometric. Part of the reason why he puts things this\nway is that he views typical causal accounts of explanation as\noperating in a reductive mode: trace the individual causal processes\nand their interactions to understand the behavior of the system. But\nchaos explanations, according to Kellert, eschew this approach,\nfocusing instead on the behavior of systems as wholes. Indeed, chaos\nexplanations tend to group models and systems together as exhibiting\nsimilar patterns of behavior without regard for their underlying causal\ndifferences. Causal processes are ignored; instead, universal patterns\nof behavior are the focus. And it is the qualitative information about\nthe geometric features of the model that are key to chaos explanations\nfor Kellert.\n \nRegarding (3), if scientific understanding is only to be achieved\nvia appeal to universal laws expressing nomic necessity—still a\nstrong intuition among many philosophers—then chaos explanations\ndefinitely do not measure up. Chaos explanations do not rely on nomic\nconsiderations at all; rather, they rely on patterns of behavior and\nvarious properties characterizing this behavior. In brief, chaos\nstudies search for patterns rather than laws.\n \nBut suppose we change the notion of laws from universal statements of\nnomic necessity to phenomenological regularities (e.g., Cartwright\n1999; Dupré 1993)? Could chaos explanations then be understood\nas a search for such phenomenological laws at the level of wholes?\nAfter all, chaos as a field is not proposing any revisions to physical\nlaws the way relativity and quantum mechanics did. Rather, if it is\nproposing anything, it is new levels of analysis and techniques for\nthis analysis. Perhaps it is at the level of wholes that interesting\nphenomenological regularities exist that cannot be probed by\nmicroreductionist approaches. But this feature, at least on first\nblush, may not count against the microreductionist in anything other\nthan an epistemological sense, that is, holistic methodologies are\nmore effective for answering some questions chaos raises.\n \nThis dynamical understanding, as Kellert denotes it,\nachieved by chaos models would suggest that typical causal accounts of\nexplanation are aimed at a different level of understanding. In other\nwords, causal accounts look much more consonant with studying the full\nnonlinear model. Chaos explanation, by contrast, pursues understanding\nby using reduced equations derived through various techniques, though\nstill based on the full nonlinear equations. This way of\nviewing things suggests that there is a kind of unification going on in\nchaos explanation after all. A set of behavior patterns serves as the\nexplanatory or unificatory features bringing together the appearance of\nsimilar features across a very diverse set of phenomena and disciplines\n(note: Kellert does not discuss unification accounts). This, in turn,\nsuggests a further possibility: A causal account of explanation is more\nappropriate at the level of the full model, while a unification account\nperhaps is more appropriate at the level of the chaotic model. The\napproaches would be complementary rather than competing.\n \nFurthermore, the claim is that study of such chaotic models can give\nus understanding of the behavior in corresponding actual-world systems.\nNot because the model trajectories are isomorphic to the system\ntrajectories; rather, because there is a topological or geometric\nsimilarity or correspondence between the models and the systems being\nmodeled. This is a different version of the faithful model assumption\nin that now the topological/geometric features of target systems are\ntaken to be faithfully represented by our chaotic models.\n \nIn contrast to Kellert, Peter Smith makes it clear that he thinks\nthere is nothing particularly special about chaos explanations in\ncomparison with explanation in mathematical physics in general (1998,\nch. 7). Perhaps it simply is the case that mathematical physics\nexplanations are not well captured by philosophical accounts of\nexplanation and this mismatch—peculiarly highlighted in a catchy\nfield such as chaos—could provide some of the reason for why\npeople have taken chaos explanations to pose radical challenges to\ntraditional philosophical accounts of explanation.\n \nIn particular, Smith takes issue with Kellert’s view that\nchaos explanations are, in the main, qualitative rather than\nquantitative. He points out that we can calculate Lyapunov exponents,\nbifurcation points as control parameters change, and even use chaos\nmodels be predict the values of evolving dynamical\nvariables—“individual trajectory picture”—at\nleast for some short time horizon. So perhaps there is more\nquantitative information to be gleaned from chaos models than Kellert\nlets on (this is particularly true if we turn to statistical methods of\nprediction). Furthermore, Smith argues that standard physics\nexplanations, along with quantitative results, always emphasize the\nqualitative features of models as well.\n \nWe might agree, then, that there is nothing particularly special or\nchallenging about chaos explanations relative to other kinds of\nexplanation in physics regarding qualitative/quantitative\nunderstanding. What does seem to be the case is that chaos\nmodels—and nonlinear dynamics models generally—make the\nextraction of usefulness quantitative information more difficult. What\nis exhibited by methodological approaches in chaos is not that\ndifferent from what happens in other areas of mathematical physics,\nwhere the mathematics is intractable and the physical insight comes with a struggle.\nMoreover, there is no guarantee that in the future we will not make\nsome kind of breakthrough placing chaos models on a much sounder first\nprinciples footing, so there does not seem to be much substance to\nthe claim that chaos explanations are different in kind from other\nmodes of explanation in mathematical physics.\n \nKellert’s discussion of “dynamic understanding”\nand Peter Smith’s critical remarks both overlap in their agreement that\nvarious robust or universal features of chaos are important for chaos\nstudies The idea of focusing on universal features such as patterns,\ncritical numbers, and so forth suggests that some form of unification\naccount of explanation is what is at work in chaos explanations: group\ntogether all examples of chaotic behavior via universal patterns and\nother features (e.g., period doubling sequences). There is disagreement\non the extent to which the methodologies of current chaos research\npresent any radically new challenges to the project of scientific\nexplanation.\n \nEven if there is not something radically new here regarding\nscientific explanation, the kind of understanding provided by chaos\nmodels is challenging to clarify. One problem is that this\n“dynamic understanding” appears to be descriptive only.\nThat is, Kellert seems to be saying we understand how chaos arises when\nwe can point to a period doubling sequence or to the presence of a\nstrange attractor, for instance. But this appears to be only providing\ndistinguishing marks for chaos rather than yielding genuine insight\ninto what lies behind the behavior, i.e., the cause of the\nbehavior. Kellert eschews causes regarding chaos explanations and there\nis a fairly straightforward reason for this: The simplified models of\nchaos appear to be just mathematics (e.g., one dimensional maps)\nbased on the original nonlinear equations. In other words, it\nlooks as if the causes have been squeezed out! So the question of\nwhether causal, unificationist or some other approach to scientific\nexplanation best captures chaos research remains open.\n \nMoreover, since all these simplified models use roughly the same\nmathematics, why should we think it is surprising that we see the same\npatterns arise over and over again in disparate models? After all, if\nall the traces of processes and interactions—the\ncauses—have been removed from chaos models, as Kellert suggests,\nwhy should it be surprising that chaos models in physics, biology,\neconomics and social psychology exhibit similar behavior? If it really\nboils down to the same mathematics in all the models, then what is it\nwe are actually coming to understand by using these models? On the\nother hand, perhaps chaos studies are uncovering universal patterns\nthat exist in the actual world, not just in mathematics. Identifying\nthese universal patterns is one thing, explaining them is another.\n \nQuantum chaos, or quantum chaology as it is better called, is the\nstudy of the relationship between chaos in the macroscopic or\nclassical domain and the quantum domain. The implications of chaos in\nclassical physics for quantum systems have received some intensely\nfocused study, with questions raised about the actual existence of\nchaos in the quantum domain and the viability of the correspondence\nprinciple between classical and quantum mechanics to name the most\nprovocative.\n \nBefore looking at these questions, there is the thorny problem of\ndefining quantum chaos. The difficulties in establishing an agreed\ndefinition of quantum chaos are actually more challenging than for\nclassical chaos (§1). Recall that there\nwere several subtleties involved in attempting to arrive at a\nconsensus definition of classical chaos. One important proposal for a\nnecessary condition is the presence of some form of stretching and\nfolding mechanism associated with a nonlinearity in the\nsystem. However, since Schrödinger’s equation is linear, quantum\nmechanics is a linear theory. This means that quantum states starting\nout initially close remain just as close (in Hilbert space norm)\nthroughout their evolution. So in contrast to chaos in classical\nphysics, there is no separation (exponential or otherwise) between\nquantum states under Schrödinger evolution. The best candidates\nfor a necessary condition for chaos appear to be missing from the\nquantum domain.\n \nInstead researchers study the quantization of classical chaotic\nsystems and these studies are known as quantum chaology: “the\nstudy of semiclassical, but nonclassical, phenomena characteristic of\nsystems whose classical counterparts exhibit chaos” (Berry 1989,\np. 335). It turns out that there are a number of remarkable behaviors\nexhibited by such quantized systems that are interesting in their own\nright. It is these behaviors that raise questions about what form\nchaotic dynamics might take in the quantum domain (if any) and the\nvalidity of the correspondence principle. Moreover, these studies\nreveal further evidence that the relationship between the quantum and\nclassical domains are subtle indeed.\n \nResearchers in quantum chaology have focused on universal\nstatistical properties that are independent of the quantum systems\nunder investigation. Furthermore, studies focus on so-called simple\nquantum systems (i.e., those that can be described by a finite number\nof parameters or finite amount of information). The kinds of\nstatistical properties studied in such systems include the statistics\nof energy levels and semi-classical structures of wave\nfunctions. These statistical properties are relevant for quantum state\ntransitions, ionization and other quantum phenomena found in atomic\nand nuclear physics, solid state physics of mesoscopic systems and even\nquantum information. Some typical systems studied are quantum\nbilliards (particles restricted to two-dimensional motions), the\nquantum kicked rotor, a single periodically driven spin and coupled\nspins. Often, iterated maps are used in investigating quantum chaos\njust as in classical chaos (§1.2.5\nabove).\n \nBilliards are a particularly well-studied family of models. Think of a\nperfectly flat billiard table and assume that the billiard balls\nbounce off the edges of the table elastically. Such a model table at\nthe macroscopic scale of our experience where the balls and edges are\ncharacterized by classical mechanics is called a classical\nbilliard. Lots of analytic results have been worked out for\nclassical billiards so this is makes billiards a very attractive model\nto study. A chaotic billiard is a classical billiard where the\nconditions lead to chaotic behavior of the balls. There is a wealth of\nresults for chaotic billiards, too. Such analytical and computational\nriches have made quantum versions of billiards workhorses for studying\nquantum chaology as will be seen below. One can produce quantum\nbilliards by using Schrödinger’s equation to describe\nparticles reflecting off the boundaries (where one specifies that the\nwave function for the particles is zero at a boundary), or one can\nstart with the equations describe a classical billiard and quantize\nthe observables (e.g., position and momentum) yielding quantized\nbilliards.\n \nTo organize the discussion, isolated systems, where the energy spectra\nare discrete, will be treated first followed by interacting systems,\nwhere energy spectra are continuous. Although whether the energy\nspectra are discrete or not is not crucial to quantum chaology,\nwhether a quantum system is isolated or not has been argued to be\npotentially important to whether chaos exists in the quantum realm.\n \nOne difference between classical chaotic dynamics and quantum dynamics\nis that the state space of the former supports fractal structure while\nthe state space of the latter does not. A second difference is that\nclassical chaotic dynamics has a continuous energy spectrum associated\nwith its motion. As previously noted, classical chaos is considered to\nbe a property of bounded macroscopic systems. In comparison, the\nquantum dynamics in bounded, isolated systems has a discrete energy\nspectrum associated with its motion. Moreover, phenomena such as SDIC\ncould only be possible in quantum systems that appropriately mirror\nclassical system behaviors. From semi-classical considerations, Berry\net al. (1979) showed that semi-classical quantum systems (see below\nfor how such systems are constructed) could be expected to mirror the\nbehavior of their corresponding classical systems only up to the\nEhrenfest time \\(t_{E}\\), of the order \\(\\ln(2\\pi/h)\\) secs, \nan estimate also known as the log time\nreflecting the exponential instability of classical chaotic\ntrajectories. In these semi-classical studies, \\(h/2\\pi\\) often is\ntreated as a parameter that is reduced in magnitude as the classical\ndomain is approached. On this view, the smaller \\(h/2\\pi\\), the\nmore “classical” the system’s behavior becomes. For\ninstance, assuming the value of Planck’s constant in KMS\nunits, \\(t_{E} \\sim 80\\) secs. As Planck’s constant\ndecreases, \\(t_{E}\\) grows. In nonchaotic\nclassical systems the orbits in state space are well isolated and\neverything well behaved for very long times. In contrast for bound\nchaotic systems the orbits start coalescing in increasing numbers on\nthe scale of\n\\(t_{E}\\), implying that the semi-classical\napproximation fails by \\(t_{E}\\). On the other\nhand, a Gaussian wave packet centered on a classical trajectory is\nthought to be able to shadow that trajectory up\nto \\(t_{E}\\) before becoming too spread out over\nthe energy surface since \\(t_{E}\\) is a measure\nof when quantum wave packets have spread too much to mimic classical\ntrajectories and the Ehrenfest theorem breaks down. So there are two\neffects at work in semi-classical systems over time: (1) the\ncoalescing of classical chaotic trajectories and (2) the spreading of\nquantum wave packets. Between the lack of nonlinearity in quantum\nmechanics and the latter two effects, things look rather bleak for\nfinding close quantum analogs of classical chaos.\n \nWhile \\(t_{E}\\) represents an important limit\nfor how long quantum state vectors can be expected to shadow classical\ntrajectories, there are interesting behaviors in the semi-classical\nquantum models corresponding to classical chaotic systems on longer\ntime scales. By performing some more detailed analysis, Tomsovic and\nHeller (1993) showed that comparing the full quantum solutions with\nsuitably chosen semi-classical solutions for some billiards problems\nprovided excellent agreement well\nafter \\(t_{E}\\) including fine details of the\nenergy spectra. For their techniques semi-classical mechanics remains\naccurate for modeling quantum systems up to a time that scales with\n\\((h/2\\pi)^{-1/2}\\).\n \nThe vast majority of these quantum chaology studies focus on three questions: \nThe first two questions focus on different directions of research,\nboth related to what is known as semi-classical mechanics. In the\nfirst, investigation starts with a classical chaotic system and seeks\nto quantize it to study its quantum behavior. To quantize a classical\nmodel, one replaces functions in the equations of motion with their\ncorresponding quantum operators. Here, there are various results\ndemonstrating that strongly ergodic classical billiards, when\nquantized, exhibit quantum ergodicity. But this is not the same as\nshowing that a classical chaotic system, when quantized, exhibits\nchaotic behavior. There are no examples of the latter due to the\nreasons listed at the beginning of this subsection. \nFurthermore, there are interesting numerical results on quantum\ninterference in quantized classical billiards (Casati 2005). Consider\na double slit with the source enclosed in a two-dimensional wave\nresonator with the shape of a classical billiard. Adjust the Gaussian\nwave packet’s initial average energy to be one 1600th of an excited\nstate of the quantized billiard and send it toward the double slit\nopening of the resonator. Let the slit width be three De Broglie\nwavelengths, and suppose that the wave packet is sharply peaked in\nmomentum so that its spatial spread, by the Heisenberg relations, is\nthe width of the resonator. If the shape of the resonator corresponds\nto a classical chaotic billiard, then there is almost no\nquantum interference. In the classical case, the multiply reflected\nwaves would become randomized in phase. On the other hand, if the\nshape of the resonator corresponds to a classical regular\nbilliard, then the well-known interference patterns emerge. So\ndepending on whether the classical billiard is chaotic or not\ndetermines whether the quantized quantum analogue exhibits\ninterference.\n \nThe second question starts with a quantum system that has some\nrelationship with a classical chaotic system via an appropriate\nsemi-classical limit. The classical-to-quantum direction often follows\nthe pioneering work of Martin Gutzweiller (1971) in quantizing the\nclassical chaotic system. The quantum-to-classical direction is much\nmore difficult and fraught with conceptual problems. Standard\napproaches, here, are to start with a quantum analogue to a classical\nchaotic system and then derive a semi-classical system that represents\nthe quantum system in some kind of classical limit (Berry 1987 and\n2001; Bokulich 2008). This work results in statistics of suitably\nnormalized energy levels for the semi-classical systems with universal\nfeatures. For classical systems that behave non-chaotically, the\nenergy levels of the semi-classical system approximate a Poisson\ndistribution, where small spacings dominate. In contrast when the\nclassical system behaves chaotically, the energy levels of the\nsemi-classical system take on a distribution originally derived by\nEugene Wigner (1951) to describe nuclear energy spectra (for\ndiscussion see Guhr et al. 1998). These latter distributions depend\nonly on some symmetry properties (e.g., the presence or absence of\ntime-reversal symmetry in the\n system).[11]\n Moreover, the presence of periodic orbits\nin the analog classical systems largely determine the properties of\nsemi-classical systems (Berry 1977).\n \nInterestingly, many classically chaotic models systems also display\nuniversal energy level fluctuations that are well described by\nWigner’s methods (Casati, Guarneri and Valz-Gris 1980; Bohigas,\nGiannoni and Schmit 1984). This has led to the quantum chaos\nconjecture: \n (Quantum Chaos Conjecture)  The short-range\n correlations in the energy spectra of semi-classical quantum systems which are\n strongly chaotic in the classical limit obey universal fluctuation\n laws based on ensembles of random matrices without free parameters.\n This conjecture is motivated by the accumulated evidence over the\ndecades that the energy spectra of very simple non-integrable\nclassically chaotic systems contain universal level fluctuations\ndescribed by random matrix theory. Given random matrix theory’s\nsuccessful application to nuclear spectra and these classical results,\nthe question of whether there were analog results for quantum systems\nwith chaotic systems as an appropriate limit seems reasonable. The\nconjecture basically means that the energy spectra for the semi-classical analogues of classical chaotic systems are structurally the same as those classical systems. This\nconjecture remains unproven, though it appears to hold for the case of\nclassical chaotic billiards and their semi-classical counterparts. Since this is a conjecture about semi-classical systems, this means that the structure of the energy spectra of semi-classical systems is strictly dependent on chaos in the corresponding classical systems  not on any chaotic behavior in quantum or semi-classical systems. \nOne can raise serious questions about these quantum-to-classical\nstudies, however. The semi-classical systems are derived using various\nasymptotic procedures (Berry 1987 and 2001), but these procedures do\nnot yield the actual classical systems that are supposed to be the\nlimiting cases of the quantum systems. More importantly, the actual\nkinds of limiting relations between the quantum and classical domains\nare different than are typically considered in semi-classical\napproaches (§6.3 below). The actual\nrelationship between the mathematical results and actual quantum and\nclassical physical systems is tenuous at best leaving us, again, with\nthe worry that chaos is an artifact of the mathematics\n(§5). One of the reasons the quantum\nchaos conjecture remains unproven likely is that inappropriate notions\nof “the classical limit” are being used. Even though the\nenergy level statistics for quantum billiards in the semi-classical\ncounterparts to classical billiard systems share universal properties,\nthe actual behavior of the trajectories in the two systems is\nsubstantially different (under Schrödinger evolution Hilbert \nspace vectors never diverge from one another).\n \nAnother fundamental problem is that classical chaos is a function of\nnonlinearities whereas Schrödinger’s equation describing quantum\nsystems is linear. Empirical investigation of quantum chaology, hence,\nusually focuses on externally driven quantum systems (see next\nsection) and scattering processes (e.g., quantum billiards). The focus\nin these studies is on the unpredictability of the time evolution of\nsuch systems and processes. Although unpredictability is a feature of\nclassical chaotic systems, there are many reasons why the time\nevolution of quantum systems may be as unpredictable (e.g., if\ncommuting observables undergo complicated dynamics). It is not clear\nthat unpredictability in externally driven quantum systems and\nscattering processes is due to any form of chaos.\n \nQuantum systems do sometimes exhibit bifurcations. For instance, rotating\nmolecules under some circumstances will undergo several consecutive\nqualitative changes that are interpreted as bifurcations\n(Zhilinskií 2001). Whether there is a series of bifurcations in\nsuch systems that could eventually lead to a transition to some form\nof quantum chaotic behavior is currently unknown.\n \nAt best, quantum chaology in isolated systems has produced results\nthat have interesting relationships with integrable and non-integrable\nclassical systems and some important experimental results (e.g.,\nBayfield and Koch 1974; Casati, Chirikov, Izrailev and Ford 1979;\nFishman, Grempel and Prange 1982; Casati, Chirikov and Shepelyanski\n1984; Berry 2001). These relationships are all statistical as\nindicated. One issue with studying isolated, closed quantum systems is\nthat the state spaces of these systems do not allow the formation of\nthe state-space structures typically associated with classical chaotic\nsystems. There are some exceptions discussed in the literature, but it\nis actually ambiguous if these are genuine cases of chaos. One example\ndiscussed in the literature is a quantum Hamiltonian operator for\nan \\(N\\)-dimensional torus:\n\\(\\bfrac{1}{2}(g_{k} n_{k} + n_{k} g_{k})\\),\nwhere \\(n_{k} = -i\\partial / \\partial \\theta_{k}, \\theta_{k}\\) \nis an angle variable, and \\(d\\theta_{i} /dt = g_{i}(\\theta_{k})\\)\nfor \\(i, k = 1, 2,3,..., N\\) (Chirikov,\nIzrailev and Shepelyanski 1988, p. 79). The probability density for\nmomentum grows exponentially fast, which seems to parallel SDIC for\ntrajectories in the classical case. Again, it is far from clear that\nthis is chaos; there is no principled reason for considering the\nexponential growth in some quantity as a mark of chaos (recall the\nexample in the first paragraph\nof §1.2.6 above).\n \nBuilding on the numerical results of the double-slit/billiard wave\nresonator described above, it may be possible to apply quantum\nchaology to the quantum measurement problem. Typically, models for\nquantum measurement describe the destruction of coherent quantum\nstates as an effect of external noise or the environment. These\nquantum chaology results could allow the development of a dynamical\ntheory of quantum decoherence due to the interaction between a\nclassical chaotic (or at least non-integrable) system and coherent\nquantum states producing the incoherent mixtures observed in\nmeasurement devices. These considerations lead us to interacting systems.\n \nThe failure to find the features of classical chaos in quantum systems\nis usually diagnosed as being due to the linear nature of\nSchrödinger’s equation (classical chaos appears to require\nnonlinearity as a necessary condition). And the evidence from isolated\nquantum systems substantiates this diagnosis as just discussed. What\nabout interacting quantum systems (which sometimes get called open\nquantum systems)? At first glance, one can argue that the linearity of\nSchrödinger’s equation implies that nearby quantum states\nwill always remain nearby as they evolve in time. However, some\nalternative possibilities for possible chaotic behavior have been\nproposed for interacting quantum systems.\n \nFred Kronz (1998, 2000) has argued that focusing on the\nseparable/nonseparable Hamiltonian distinction is more appropriate\nthan nonlinearity for the question of quantum chaos\n(1.2.7 Taking Stock above). Although\nSchrödinger’s equation is linear, there are many examples\nof nonseparable Hamiltonians in quantum mechanics. A prime example\nwould be the Hamiltonian describing an interaction between a\nmeasurement device and a quantum system. In such situations, the\nquantum system-measurement apparatus compound system can evolve from a\ntensor product state to a nonseparable entangled state represented by\nan irreducible superposition of tensor product states. A second\nubiquitous example would be the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\ncorrelations. Although many, such as Robert Hilborn (1994, 549–569),\nhave argued that the unitary evolution of quantum systems makes SDIC\nimpossible for quantum mechanics, these arguments do not take into\naccount that interacting quantum systems typically have nonseparable\nHamiltonians.\n \nFor interacting quantum systems, Schrödinger’s equation is no\nlonger valid and one typically turns to so-called master equations to\ndescribe evolution (Davies 1976). Such equations typically have\nnonseparable Hamiltonians. In general, the time evolution of the\ncomponents of such interacting systems is not unitary meaning that there is\nno formal prohibition against SDIC. Moreover, an important contrast between\nisolated and interacting quantum systems is that while the former have discrete\nenergy spectra, the latter have continuous spectra. A continuous\nenergy spectrum is characteristic of classical systems. Nevertheless,\nwork in interacting quantum systems largely has only uncovered the same kinds of\nuniversal statistical characteristics of energy spectra and\nfluctuations as found in isolated systems (e.g., Guhr,\nMüller-Groeling and Weidenmüller 1998; Ponomarenko, et\nal. 2008; Filikhin, Matinyan and Vlahovic 2011).\n \nIt is often the case that the quantum chaology literature uses a\nbroader notion of chaos as behavior that “cannot be described as\na superposition of independent one-dimensional motions”\n(Ponomarenko, et al. 2008, p. 357); in other words, a form of\ninseparability. Still, the chaology in interacting quantum systems looks to\nbe the same as in isolated systems: “Quantum mechanically, chaotic\nsystems are characterized by distinctive statistics of their energy\nlevels, which must comply with one of the Gaussian random ensembles,\nin contrast to the level statistics for the nonchaotic systems\ndescribed by the Poisson distribution” (Ponomarenko, et al.\n2008, p. 357). This is largely due to the fact that quantum chaology\nis closely tied to universal statistical patterns in quantum systems\nthat share some relationship with classical chaotic counterpart\nsystems.\n \nOne of the measures used to detect chaotic behavior in classical\nsystems is a positive Kolmogorov entropy, which can be related to\nLyapunov exponents (e.g., Atmanspacher and Scheingraber\n1987). Unfortunately, there are no appropriate analogous for Lyapunov\nexponents in quantum systems. There are alternative entropy measures\nthat could be used, for instance, the von Neumann or\nConnes-Narnhofer-Thirring entropies. However, there are currently many\nopen questions about which, if any, of these entropy measures is the\nappropriate quantum analog (likely they are each appropriate for\nparticular research purposes). Moreover, while these measures have a\nrelationship to the statistics of energy levels and states\ncharacteristic of quantum chaology, there currently are no other known\nfeatures of quantum systems that these measures could relate to\nchaotic behavior observed in classical trajectories.\n \nThere is an interesting physical model of a charged particle in a unit\nsquare with periodic boundary conditions with an external\nelectromagnetic field that occasionally gives it a kick (turns on and\noff). Mathematically this model is a generalization of the quantized\nArnold cat map (Arnold and Avez 1968; Weigert 1990; Weigert\n1993). Physically it represents a charged particle confined to an\nenergy surface shaped like a torus that receives kicks from an\nexternal field. The classical model has trajectories that exhibit the\nstretching and folding process that seems to be a necessary condition\nfor chaos, has positive Lyapunov exponents, and is algorithmically\ncomplex[12], one\nof the measures used to detect classical chaos. Its trajectories have\nmany of the marks of chaos. For the quantum model, the kick of the\nelectromagnetic field has the effect of mapping the quantum labels of\nstate vectors that are initially close together to labels which do not\nnecessarily ever come close again. This is somewhat reminiscent of the\ndivergence of classical chaotic trajectories except that it is the\nchange in the state labels that plays the role of the classical\ntrajectories. This leads to an absolutely continuous quasi-energy\nspectrum (the quasi-energy is defined as the set of numbers\nrepresenting the “energy” in the evolution operator acting on state\nvector labels). The expectation value of the particle position becomes\nunpredictable with respect to the initial state label after long times\nand one can show that the sequence of shifts of the quantum state\nlabels is algorithmically complex. Moreover, a “distance”\nbetween the labels can be defined that increases exponentially with\ntime.\n \nThis is the most convincing example in quantum chaology of behavior\nanalogous to classical chaos. However, there are issues that raise\nquestions about whether the behavior of the sequences of quantum state\nlabels is enough to qualify the system as chaotic. For one thing, the\nquantum chaos conjecture is inapplicable to this system due to the\ncontinuous spectrum of the quasi-energy. More importantly, as pointed\nabout above, exponential divergence is neither necessary nor\nsufficient to characterize a system as chaotic, and neither is\nalgorithmic complexity. There are many examples of systems that are\nalgorithmically complex but are not chaotic. Long randomly generated\nbit strings, no matter how they were obtained, are algorithmically\ncomplex but need not have any relationship to chaos. The behavior of\nthe quantum labels for the kicked particle is irregular to be sure,\nbut the actual temporal evolution of the state vectors is\nalgorithmically compressible, so not irregular in any way.\n \nThe kind of behavior observed in quantum chaology involves the\nstatistics of energy states in quantum systems that have some kind of\nrelationship to classical chaotic systems (e.g., by quantizing the\nlatter systems). Important features of classical chaos, such as SDIC\nand the period doubling route to chaos, appear to be absent from\nquantum systems. This situation has led to arguments that the\ncorrespondence principle between quantum and classical mechanics fails\nand that the former may be incomplete (Ford 1992).\n \nThe correspondence principle can be understood broadly to mean that as\na quantum system system is scaled up to macroscopic size, its behavior should become more like a classical system. Alternatively, the behavior of a quantum model should reproduce the behavior of macroscopic classical models in the limit of large quantum numbers. The correspondence principle is sometimes conceived as letting Planck’s constant\ngo to zero. Nevertheless,\nall these conceptions are terribly inadequate. Since \\(h\\) is a\nconstant of nature, it can never change value, much less go to\nzero. One always has to speak of relevant limits of ratios of the classical to\nquantum actions, for example, which always involve Planck’s\nconstant. Moreover, these limits are singular, meaning\nthat the smooth behavior of a quantity or pattern is disrupted, often\nby becoming infinite (Friedrichs 1955; Dingle 1973; Primas 1998). So\nthere is no straightforward sense in which quantum models become\nincreasingly similar to macroscopic systems as quantum numbers get\nlarge.\n \nJoseph Ford offers a different construal of the correspondence\nprinciple: “any two valid physical theories which have an\noverlap in their domains of validity must, to relevant accuracy, yield\nthe same predictions for physical observations.” In the case of\nquantum and Newtonian mechanics, this means that “quantum\nmechanics must, in general agree with the predictions of Newtonian\nmechanics when the systems under study are macroscopic” (1992,\np. 1087). Unfortunately, he gives no discussion of what “domains\nof validity” mean or in what sense quantum and Newtonian\nmechanics have some overlap in their domains of validity. What he\nclaims in his American Journal of Physics article is that\n“The very essence of correspondence lies in the notion that\nquantum mechanics can describe events in the macroscopic world without\nany limit taking. Were this not the case, then there would be no\noverlap in the quantal and classical regions of validity” (1992,\np. 1088). Sir Michael Berry is even more direct: “all\nsystems,” even our orbiting moon, “obey the laws of\nquantum mechanics” (Berry 2001, p. 42). The upshot for chaos is\nthat “if there is chaos (however defined) in the macroscopic\nworld, quantum mechanics must also exhibit precisely the same chaos,\nelse quantum mechanics is not as general a theory as popularly\nsupposed” (Ford 1992, p. 1088).\n \nAs seen above, classical chaotic behavior is not recovered in quantum\nchaology, and this leads to a dilemma: Either the correspondence\nprinciple is false or quantum mechanics is incomplete. Ford, as would\nmost physicists, rejects the first horn of the dilemma. Therefore, the\nproblem must lie with quantum mechanics: Its lack of chaos reveals\nsome incompleteness in the theory. Something is missing.\n \nThis dilemma is false, however. The way Ford (and to some degree Berry\namong others) describes things bespeaks a common misconception of the\nrelationship between the quantum and classical domains. Much as he\nmakes of the subtlety of limiting relations—and they are much\nmore subtle than he realizes—his discussion of the\ncorrespondence principle actually turns on an overly simple\nrelationship between the quantum and classical domains. That overly\nsimple relationship presupposes that quantum mechanics fully explains\nclassical phenomena, or, alternatively, that quantum mechanics reduces\nthe classical domain in an appropriate limit. Under such a\npresupposition, if classical chaos either does not exist in quantum\nmechanics or if the latter cannot explain or reproduce classical\nchaos, then it appears that there is some inadequacy with quantum\nmechanics.\n \nThe relationship between the quantum and classical domains is\nnontrivial. First, it does not involve a “classical\nlimit,” but a series of limits of the ratio of quantum\nobservables involving Planck’s constant and other physical\nobservables going to zero (e.g., relevant classical and quantum actions),\nor limits involving the separation of nuclear and electronic frames of\nmotion (in the case of chemistry) among others. All of these limits\ninvolve singular asymptotic series; hence, the relationship between\nquantum phenomena and classical phenomena is not one involving\nanything like bridge laws relating the two domains as Nagelian and\nother forms of reduction would require. There is a change in the\ncharacter of the states and observables going from the quantum to the\nclassical domains (Bishop, 2010b). The classical states and\nobservables are neither a function of nor straightforwardly\nrelated to intrinsic states and observables in quantum mechanics.\n \nSecond, even starting with the quantum domain, there are different\nclassical worlds that result from taking these various limits in\ndifferent orders. Since these limits correspond to different physical\ntransitions, changing the order of the limits changes the order of\nphysical transitions yielding physically inequivalent macroscopic\ndomains. Given the physical incompatibility among these different\nmacroscopic worlds, the actual physical transitions between the quantum\nand classical must occur in a particular order to recover the\nclassical domain of our experience.\n \nOf course, there is much discussion of the “approximately\nclassical” or “quasi-classical” trajectories for\nquantum systems that can be derived from semi-classical considerations\n(Berry 1987 and 2001). But such quasi-classical behavior is exhibited\nonly for limited times (except for overly idealized models) and under\nvery special initial conditions (Pauli 1933, p. 166) for ground\nstates only (excited energy eigenstates never show classical\nbehavior). Appeal to Ehrenfest’s theorem is of no help, here,\nbecause all this theorem guarantees for such very special, short-lived\ndynamics is that the usual physics practice of averaging the values of\nthe quantum-mechanical observables tends to wash out the errors or\ndifferences between the classical and quantum calculations for\ncontextually relevant situations and times. Moreover, the theorem is\nneither necessary nor sufficient for classical behavior. For instance,\napplying Ehrenfest’s theorem to a quantum harmonic oscillator\nyields average quantities for the position and momentum that track\nwith the classical quantities for some brief time. Yet, the quantum\noscillator’s discrete states yield thermodynamic properties very\ndifferent from a classical oscillator. So satisfying the theorem is\ninsufficient to guarantee classical behavior.\n \nThird, the emergence of our classical world is not merely a matter of\nenvironmental decoherence (e.g., Omnés 1994; Berry 2001;\nWallace 2012). For one thing, there is no context-free limit of\ninfinitely many degrees of freedom because this limit always has\nuncountably infinitely many physically inequivalent\nrepresentations. Moreover, it is simply false that an improper mixture\nof quantum states “allows one to interpret the state of the\n[quantum] system in terms of a classical probability\ndistribution,” such that “it is useful to regard\n‘mixed states’ as effectively classical,” so that\n“one can interpret the system described by [a nonpure density\noperator] in terms of a classical ‘mixture’ with the exact\nstate of the system unknown to the observer” (Zurek 1991,\n46–47). Impure quantum states can be interpreted as classical\nmixtures if and only if their components are described by\ndisjoint states. For a classical mixture of two pure states (e.g.,\nwater and oil), the pure states are disjoint if and only if there\nexists a classical observable such that the expectation values with\nrespect to these states are different. It is this disjointness that\nmakes it possible to distinguish states in a classical manner.\n \nIn summary, there is nothing in the quantum domain by itself that\ndetermines the character of the classical domain (though the former\nprovides some necessary conditions for the latter). Hence, classical\nchaos, along with many other classical features, is emergent in a more\ncomplex, subtle sense than Ford and others allow. The correspondence\nprinciple must reflect emergent classicality if it is to be a viable\nprinciple, which means that the implicit assumption of reductionism in\nFord’s discussions of quantum chaology should be abandoned. Once the\nreductionist assumption is removed, the disparity between quantum\nchaology and classical chaos no longer calls an appropriately\nformulated correspondence principle into question. This resolves the\nfirst horn of the dilemma.\n \nThe second horn of the dilemma likewise is resolved. There is no\nreason to suspect that there is some kind of inadequacy in quantum\nmechanics if features such as chaos are emergent in the classical\ndomain. Neither the generality nor the validity of quantum mechanics\nis in question. Nor does the complex, subtle emergent relationship\nbetween the quantum and classical domains imply that the two domains\nare nonoverlapping or disjoint. Rather, the overlap between the\nquantum and classical is partial and nontrivial. Quantum mechanics is\nuniversally applicable, but this in no way implies that it alone\nuniversally governs classical behavior. It contributes some of the\nnecessary conditions for classical properties and behaviors, but no\nsufficient conditions. One indicator of this is that\nclassical mechanics is formulated in terms of continuous trajectories\nof individual particles through spacetime, while quantum mechanics is\nformulated in terms of probabilities and wave functions. There are\ndeep conceptual differences between the classical and the\nquantum.[13]\nThis suggests that we should not expect individual continuous\ntrajectories to result from quantum mechanics in contextually\ninappropriate limits nor that quantum mechanics should exhibit the full\nrange of classical behaviors, contrary to Ford and others. Instead, we\nshould expect that quantum probabilities recover the classical\nprobabilities in the contextually appropriate situations and that\nthere should be some interesting relationships between quantum and\nclassical properties and behaviors. The interesting statistical\nregularities discovered in quantum chaology fit with this emergent,\nnontrival overlapping relationship nicely.\n \nThere have been some discussions regarding the wider implications of\nchaos for other domains of philosophical inquiry. Three of the more\nthought-provoking ones will be surveyed here.\n \nRecall that mathematically, chaos is a property of dynamical systems\nwhich are deterministic (§1.2.1). Since\nthe 18th century, the best models of and support for metaphysical\ndeterminism were thought to be the determinism of theories and models\nin physics. But this strategy is more problematic and subtle than has\nbeen typically realized (e.g., due to the difficulties with faithful\n models, §3.). So perhaps it is not so\nsurprising that some have argued that chaos reflects some form of\nindeterminism; hence, the world is not metaphysically\ndeterministic. Of course, chaotic systems are notorious for their\nunpredictability, and some such as Karl Popper (1950) have argued that\nunpredictability implies indeterminism. Yet this is to identify\ndeterminism (an ontological property) with predictability (an\nepistemic property).\n \nAn example of someone who has pushed the claim that chaotic behavior\nimplies that determinism fails for our word is physicist turned\nAnglican priest, John Polkinghorne: “The apparently\ndeterministic proves to be intrinsically unpredictable. It is\nsuggested that the natural interpretation of this exquisite\nsensitivity is to treat it, not merely as an epistemological barrier,\nbut as an indication of the ontological openness of the world of\ncomplex dynamical systems” (1989, p. 43). Giving a critical\nrealist reading of epistemology and ontology, Polkinghorne seeks to\nlink the epistemological barrier with an ontological failure of\ndeterminism because of ontological openness to influences not fully\naccounted for in our physics descriptions. Nevertheless, the\nmathematical properties of dynamical systems (e.g., their\ndeterministic character) present a serious problem with this line of\nreasoning. Determinism as unique evolution appears to be preserved in\nour mathematical models of chaos, which serve as our ontic\ndescriptions of chaotic\n systems.[14] \nWhat would it take to raise questions about the determinism of\nactual-world systems? For nonlinear dynamical systems, their presumed\nconnection with target systems is one place to start. Mathematical\nmodeling of actual-world systems requires distinctions between\nvariables and parameters as well as between systems and their\nboundaries. However, where linear superposition is lost such\ndistinctions become problematic (Bishop 2010a). This situation raises\nquestions about our epistemic access to systems and models in the\ninvestigation of complex systems, but also raises questions about\ninferring the supposed determinism of target systems based on these\nmodels. Moreover, if the system in question is nonlinear, then the\nfaithful model assumption (§1.2.3)\nraises difficulties for inferring the determinism of the target system\nfrom the deterministic character of the model.\n \nConsider the problem of the mapping between the model and the target\nsystem. There is no guarantee that this mapping is one-to-one even for\nthe most faithful model. The mapping may actually be a many-to-one\nrelation or a many-to-many relationship. A one-to-one relationship\nbetween a deterministic model and target system would make the\ninference from the deterministic character of our mathematical model\nto the deterministic character of the target system more\nsecure. However, a many-to-one mapping raises problems. One might\nthink this can be resolved by requiring the entire model class in a\nmany-to-one relation be deterministic. Such a requirement is\nnontrivial, though. For instance, it’s not uncommon for different\nmodeling groups to submit proposals for the same project, where some\npropose deterministic models and others propose nondeterministic\nmodels. Nonlinear models render any inferences from physics to\nmetaphysical determinism shaky at best.\n \nA number of authors have looked to quantum mechanics to help explain\nconsciousness and free will (e.g., Compton 1935; Eccles 1970; Penrose\n1991, 1994 and 1997; Beck and Eccles 1992; Stapp 1993; Kane 1996;\n quantum consciousness).\nStill it has been less clear to many that quantum mechanics is relevant\nto consciousness and free will. For example, an early objection to\nquantum effects influencing human volitions was offered by philosopher\nJ. J. C. Smart (1963, \n pp. 123–4).[15]\n Even if indeterminism was true at the quantum level, Smart argued\nthat the brain remains deterministic in its operations because quantum\nevents are insignificant by comparison. After all a single neuron is\nknown to be excited by on the order of a thousand molecules, each\nmolecule consisting of ten to twenty atoms. Quantum effects though\nsubstantial when focusing on single atoms are presumed negligible when\nfocusing on systems involving large numbers of molecules. So it looks\nlike quantum effects would be too insignificant in comparison to the\neffects of thousands of molecules to play any possible role in\nconsciousness or deliberation.  \nArguments such as Smart’s do not take into consideration the\npossibility for amplifying quantum effects through the interplay\nbetween SDIC at the level of the macroscopic world on the one hand\nand quantum effects on the other (see\n §4).\n SD arguments purport to demonstrate that chaos in classical systems\ncan amplify quantum fluctuations due to sensitivity to the smallest\nchanges in initial conditions. Along these lines suppose (somewhat\nsimplistically) the patterns of neural firings in the brain correspond\nto decision states. The idea is that chaos could amplify quantum\nevents causing a single neuron to fire that would not have fired\notherwise. If the brain (a macroscopic object) is also in a chaotic\ndynamical state, making it sensitive to small disturbances, this\nadditional neural firing, small as it is, would then be further\namplified to the point where the brain states would evolve differently\nthan if the neuron had not fired. In turn these altered neural firings\nand brain states would carry forward such quantum effects affecting\nthe outcomes of human choices.  \nThere are several objections to this line of argument. First, the\npresence of chaos in the brain and its operations is an empirical\nmatter that is hotly debated (Freeman and Skarda 1987; Freeman 1991,\n2000; Kaneko, Tsuda and Ikegami 1994 pp. 103–189;\nVandervert 1997; Diesmann, Gewaltig and Aertsen 1999; Lehnertz 2000;\nVan Orden, Holden and Turvey 2003 and 2005; Aihara 2008; Rajan, Abbott\nand Sompolinsky 2010). It should be pointed out, however, that these\ndiscussions typically assume SD or Chaos\\(_{\\lambda}\\) as the\ndefinition of chaos. All that is really needed for sensitivity to and\namplification of quantum effects in the brain is the loss of principle\nof superposition found in nonlinear systems. Second, these kinds of\nsensitivity arguments depend crucially on how quantum mechanics itself\nand measurements are interpreted as well as the status of\nindeterminism (§4). Third, although\nin the abstract sensitivity arguments seem to lead to the conclusion\nthat the smallest of effects can be amplified, applying such arguments\nto concrete physical systems shows that the amplification process may\nbe severely constrained. In the case of the brain, we\ncurrently do no know what constraints on amplification exist.  \nAn alternative possibility avoiding many of the difficulties exhibited\nin the chaos+quantum mechanics approach is suggested by the research\non far-from-equilibrium systems by Ilya Prigogine and his\nBrussels-Austin Group (Bishop 2004). Their work purports to offer\nreasons to search for a different type of indeterminism in both micro\nand macrophysical domains.\n \nConsider a system of particles. If the particles are distributed\nuniformly in position in a region of space, the system is\nsaid to be in thermodynamic equilibrium (e.g., cream uniformly\ndistributed throughout a cup of coffee). In contrast, if the system is\nfar-from-equilibrium (nonequilibrium) the particles are arranged so\nthat highly ordered structures might appear (e.g., a cube of ice floating in\ntea). The following properties characterize nonequilibrium statistical\nsystems: large number of particles, high degree of structure and order,\ncollective behavior, irreversibility, and emergent properties. The\nbrain possesses all these properties, so that the brain can be\nconsidered a nonequilibrium system (an equilibrium brain is a dead\nbrain!).\n \nLet me quickly sketch a simplified version of the approach to point\nout why the developments of the Brussels-Austin Group offer an\nalternative for investigating the connections between physics,\nconsciousness and free will. Conventional approaches in physics\ndescribe systems using particle trajectories as a fundamental\nexplanatory element of their models, meaning that the behavior of a\nmodel is derivable from the trajectories of the particles composing the\nmodel. The equations governing the motion of these particles are\nreversible with respect to time (they can be run backwards and forwards\nlike a film). When there are too many particles involved to make these\ntypes of calculations feasible (as in gases or liquids), coarse-grained\naveraging procedures are used to develop a statistical picture of how\nthe system behaves rather than focusing on the behavior of individual\nparticles.\n \nIn contrast the Brussels-Austin approach views nonequilibrium\nsystems in terms of nonlinear models whose fundamental explanatory\nelements are distributions; that is to say, the arrangements of the\nparticles are the fundamental explanatory elements and not the\nindividual particles and\n trajectories.[16]\n The equations governing the behavior of these distributions are\ngenerally irreversible with respect to time. In addition focusing\nexclusively on distribution functions opens the possibility that\nmacroscopic nonequilibrium models are irreducibly indeterministic, an\nindeterminism that has nothing to do with ignorance about the\nsystem. If so, this would mean probabilities are as much an\nontologically fundamental element of the macroscopic world as they are\nof the microscopic and are free of the interpretive difficulties found\nin conventional quantum mechanics.  \nOne important insight of the Brussels-Austin Group’s shift away from\ntrajectories to distributions as fundamental elements is that\nexplanation also shifts from a local context (set of particle\ntrajectories) to a global context (distribution of the entire set of\nparticles). Systems acting as a whole may produce collective effects\nthat are not reducible to a summation of the trajectories and\nsubelements composing the system (Bishop 2004 and 2012). The brain\nexhibits this type of collective behavior in many circumstances (Engel,\net al. 1997) and the work of Prigogine and his colleagues\ngives us another tool for trying to understand that\nbehavior. Moreover, nonlinear nonequilibrium models also exhibit SDIC,\nso there are a number of possibilities in such approaches for very\nrich dynamical description of brain operations and cognitive phenomena\n(e.g., Juarrero 1999; Chemero and Silberstein 2008). Though the\nBrussels-Austin approach to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics is\nstill speculative and contains some open technical questions, it\n offers an alternative for exploring the relationship between\nphysics, consciousness and free will as well as pointing to a new\npossible source for indeterminism to be explored in free will\ntheories.\n \nWhether approaches applying chaotic dynamics to understanding the\nnature of consciousness and free will represent genuine advances\nremains an open question. For example, if the world is deterministic,\nthen the invocation of SDIC in cognitive dynamics (e.g., Kane 1996)\nmay provide a sophisticated framework for exploring deliberative\nprocesses, but would not be sufficient for incompatibilist\nnotions of freedom. On the other hand, if indeterminism (quantum\nmechanical or otherwise) is operative in the brain, the challenge\nstill remains for indeterminists such Robert Kane (1996) to\ndemonstrate that agents can effectively harness such indeterminism by\nutilizing the exquisite sensitivity provided by nonlinear dynamics to\nground and explain free will. Questions about realism and explanation\nin chaotic dynamics\n (§5)\n are relevant here as well as the faithful model assumption.  \nThere has also been much recent work applying the perspective of\ndynamical systems to cognition and action, drawing explicitly on such\nproperties as attractors, bifurcations, SDIC and other denizens of the\nnonlinear zoo (e.g., van Gelder 1995; Kelso 1995; Port and van Gelder\n1995; Juarrero 1999; Tsuda 2001). The basic idea is to deploy the\nframework of nonlinear dynamics for interpreting neural and cognitive\nactivity as well as complex behavior. It is then hoped that patterns\nof neural, cognitive and human activity can be explained as the\nresults of nonlinear dynamical processes involving causal interactions\nand constraints at multiple levels (e.g., neurons, brains, bodies,\nphysical environments). Such approaches are highly suggestive, but\nalso face challenges. For instance, as mentioned in the previous\nsection, the nature of neural and cognitive dynamics is still much\ndisputed. Ultimately, it is an empirical matter whether these\ndynamics are largely nonlinear or not. Moreover, the explanatory power\nof dynamical systems approaches relative to rival computational\napproaches has been challenged (e.g., Clark 1998). Again, questions\nabout realism and explanation in chaotic dynamics\n (§5)\n are relevant here as well as the faithful model assumption.  \n Furthermore, Polkinghorne (among others), as previously noted, has\nproposed interpreting the randomness in macroscopic chaotic models and\nsystems as representing a genuine indeterminism rather than merely a\nmeasure of our ignorance (1991, pp. 34–48). The idea is\nthat such openness or indeterminism is not only important to the free\nwill and action that we experience (pp. 40–1), but also for\ndivine action in the world (e.g., Polkinghorne\n1989; §7.1). In essence the sensitivity to\nsmall changes exhibited by the systems and models studied in chaotic\ndynamics, complexity theory and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics\nis taken to represent an ontological opening in the physical order for\ndivine activity. However the sensitivity upon which Polkinghorne\nrelies would also be open to quantum influences whether deterministic\nor indeterministic. Furthermore, as mentioned previously in\nconnection with the Brussels-Austin program, much rides on whether a\nsource for indeterminism in chaotic behavior can be found. If\nPolkinghorne’s suggestion amounts to simply viewing the world as\nif chaos harbors indeterminism, then it seems that this\nsuggestion doesn’t yield the kind of divine action he\nseeks.  \nChaos and nonlinear dynamics are not only rich areas for scientific\ninvestigation, but also raise a number of interesting philosophical\nquestions. The majority of these questions, however, remain thoroughly\nunder studied by philosophers.\n","contact.mail":"Robert.C.Bishop@wheaton.edu","contact.domain":"wheaton.edu"}]
