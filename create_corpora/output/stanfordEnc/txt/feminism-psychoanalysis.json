In doing so, it\ndiscloses the ways in which our sense of self, and our political\nloyalties and attachments, are influenced by unconscious drives and\nordered by symbolic structures that are beyond the purview of\nindividual agency. It might appear at the outset that any\nalliance between feminism and psychoanalysis would have to be\ncoordinated on treacherous ground: in Sigmund Freud's\nlecture on “Femininity,” for instance, while discussing the\n“riddle of femininity” (Freud 1968 [1933], 116) or of\nsexual differentiation, Freud's rhetoric impeaches women as\n“the problem” (113) and excuses members of his audience\nfrom this indictment by offering the hope that they are “more\nmasculine than feminine” (117). Many feminists have been\nwary both of the biases contained in Freud's oratory and of the\novert content of his claims. This article will explain how and\nwhy feminist theory has, nonetheless, undertaken a serious reading of\nFreud and developed careful analyses of his fundamental concepts,\nworking out their limits, impasses, and possibilities.\n\n\n\nIn the same essay cited above, Freud writes that\n“psychoanalysis does not try to describe what a woman is—that\nwould be a task it could scarcely perform—but sets about enquiring\nhow she comes into being, how a woman develops out of a child with a\nbisexual disposition” (Freud 1968 [1933], 116). In using\nthe term ‘bisexual,’ Freud refers to a quality of the\nsexual instinct, not a relation to a sexual object (which would be\ndenoted by the term ‘inversion’); the bisexual child is one\nwho psychically is not yet either a man or a woman, whose instinctual\nlife functions prior to sexual difference. Freud here portrays\nfemininity as one trajectory of the Oedipal Complex and indicates that\nsexed identity is a fragile achievement rather than a natural given or\nessence. By circumscribing the terrain on which the\npsychoanalytic account of sexual difference moves, and by seeing\nunresolved, even unresolvable, riddles where others might see the work\nof nature or culture, Freud problematizes any causal, seamless, or\ndirect tie between sex, sexuality, and sexual difference.\nPsychoanalytic inquiry does not fit comfortably with, and even\nunsettles, biological theories of sex and sociological theories of\ngender, thus also complicating the sex/gender distinction as it has\noften been formulated in feminist debates. While sex and gender\nare sometimes construed in feminist theory in terms of the contrast\nbetween biology and culture, or nature and nurture, Freud's\ntheory, as discussed below, challenges these dualisms, developing an\naccount of the sexual drive that traverses the mental and the physical,\nand undergoes idiosyncratic vicissitudes rather than assuming a uniform\nanatomical or social shape. Whatever the hazards of Freud's\nwritings on women, then, his work explores in new ways the meaning and\npossibilities of sexed identity. Likewise, as I will argue below,\npsychoanalytic feminism interrupts many assumptions about what feminism\nis and the conceptual and material objects it theorizes, including\nespecially the very concept of woman. In unsettling our\nunderstanding of this concept, psychoanalysis also poses questions to\nfeminism about the value of difference and the quest for equality, and\nthe unresolved tensions between these divergent pursuits.\n\n\n\nWhile there is no doubt a vast ouvre of disparate positions\nthat might fall within the framework of psychoanalytic feminism, what\nis shared in common is a descent from, respect for, and some minimal\nborrowing of Freudian accounts of the unconscious, even while\ncriticizing and/or revising his theoretical apparatus. Any\nproperly psychoanalytic theory must at the least offer an account of\nthe unconscious and its bond with sexuality and, arguably, death.\nPrecisely this descent, however, has also provided a barrier to\nfeminist deployment since Freud is sometimes read, at least\nsuperficially, as proffering misogynist, and perhaps Procrustean,\nelaborations of psychic structuration, curtailing and diminishing the\ndiversity of individual women's experiences into a restricted and\nunvarying formula that will fit within its own theoretical\nparameters. Nevertheless, Freud's reflections and\nhypotheses concerning hysteria, the Oedipal Complex, female sexuality\nand femininity, and women's role in civilization, among other\nideas, have provided the volatile grounds, the sites of contention, for\nfeminist re-articulation. Before any of the multiple and\ndivergent articulations of psychoanalytic feminism can be discussed in\nmore detail, we must thus first establish their historical roots and\nthe conceptual terrain on which they arise. Since a great deal of\npsychoanalytic feminist theory is specifically concerned with revising\nthe Oedipal narrative of Freud, this article will devote particular\nattention to Freud's theories of the unconscious as they pertain\nto the Oedipal Complex.\n\n\n\nRooted in both clinical practice with patients and speculative\nattempts to apprehend and delineate foundational concepts,\nFreud's psychoanalysis aims to offer descriptions of psychical\nstructures that underlie and account for individual experience in the\nvariety of its empirical formations. Rather than the rationally\nself-interested individual presumed by liberal political theory or the\nself-contained and independent cogito presumed by Cartesian\nepistemology, Freud puts forward a divided subject, unknown to itself,\nan ‘I’ traversed by multiple agencies. According to\nKristeva, “Freud's discovery designated sexuality as the\nnexus between language and society, drives and the socio-symbolic\norder” (Kristeva 1984, 84). Freud's break-through\ninsight, in other words, is that sexual bonds initiate us into\nsubjectivity and civilization. \n\nFreud distinguishes human drives from instincts insofar as drives\n(unlike instincts) have no pre-given aim or object supplied by nature\nand follow no pre-set biological path. For those who inhabit a\nhuman world, drives might come to be attached to any number of aims or\nobjects, and felt through any number of bodily locales. Drives,\naccording to Freud, become specified in these ways through the\nmediation of ideas or representations. Human embodiment is thus imbued\nwith opaque meaning, and sexuality emerges from a kind of instinctual\ninadequacy that presents desire as a difficulty or problem, and propels\nits increasing complexification. \n\nThe core of Freud's claim about the impact of sexuality on\npsychic processes can be discerned starting with Freud's early works on\nhysteria, although a crucial transformation in his thinking must be\nclarified. In Studies in Hysteria (1895), written in\ncollaboration with Josef Breuer, Freud examines the phenomenon whereby\na symptom might exist in the absence of an organic lesion.\nHysteria is diagnosed when it is an idea or memory that makes one ill,\nwithout any physical disease being the cause. By definition,\nhysteria is ideogenic (caused by an idea), as it designates the process\nby which a troubling but repressed idea is converted into a bodily\nsymptom. Freud initially posits that hysterical symptoms arise as\na result of violent childhood seduction (what today would be called\nmolestation), a real trauma that is then retroactively set in motion by\na second, comparatively more mild, event, after a period of\nlatency. The ‘seduction hypothesis’ is an attempt to\nexplain the aetiology of hysteria (the origins of neurosis) by the\ntraumatic force of a premature sexual experience occurring in early\nchildhood, an external event that impinges upon the psychical apparatus\nbut whose memory is repressed, cut off from consciousness. The\nrepressed memory becomes somatized (enacted on the body and in bodily\nsymptoms) when a later event, usually occurring in puberty, catalyzes\nthe earlier memory traces. The talking cure is developed as a way\nto bring repressed memories forward and abreact or release them,\nre-binding the idea to its severed and dispersed affect (unrepressing\nit) and thereby dissolving the bodily symptom. \n\nIn the later Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality\n(1905), Freud contends, contrary to the earlier supposition that\nsexuality intervenes from the outside, that sexuality is a primordial\nand innate (if also inchoate) force of infantile life, arising from the\nbodily sensations that accompany the life processes. In the\ninterim between these two works, Freud had abandoned the seduction\nhypothesis and replaced it with the thesis of infantile sexuality and\nthe idea that symptoms are brought about via the conflicts and\nrepressions of unconscious fantasy. In other words, it is no\nlonger repressed memory that makes one ill and traumatic sexual violence no longer figures\nas the primary cause of symptoms. Instead of an actual past\nexperience, Freud posits fantasy as the determining factor of neurotic\nsymptoms. To understand the significance of this transition in\nhis thinking, we must grasp what Freud means by psychical reality and\nits distinction from material reality. In contrast to the\nhistorical, intersubjective domain of material reality, psychical\nreality is the vital domain of fantasy and intra-psychic life,\noperating independently of objective considerations of veracity.\nIn Freud's view, unconscious fantasies are not lies or\ndeceptions, but reveal a truth, not about the objective world, but\nabout the internal life of the subject, who one is and what one\nwants. It might be better to say that fantasies conceal this\ntruth, since conscious articulations of desire and identity will often\nlead us astray, expressing but distorting, manifesting but denying, the\nsubject's wishes. \n\nAs Freud documents in “Remembering, Repeating, and\nWorking-Through” (1914), the conjectural move from memory to\ndesire and from fact to fantasy is also a move from external scenes of\nseduction to internal psychical acts, from past events to present-day\nforces, and from passive submission to active maintenance of\ndiscord. Instead of an external event impinging upon a\nchild's undeveloped sexuality, the idea of infantile sexuality\npresupposes both an energetic drive force at work from earliest\nchildhood and an internal or intrapsychic dissension, a subject at odds\nwith its own desires. The thesis of infantile sexuality\nuniversalizes the event of trauma, locating its experience in the\ninstinctual excitations that overwhelm the psychical apparatus which is\nprematurely affected. In discarding the seduction hypothesis,\nFreud not only discovers the domain of fantasy and psychical reality,\nbut he also paves the way for considering the energetics of the libido,\nthe intrapsychic conflict that is intrinsic to human being, and the\nidea of responsibility for the dissonances of desire and the skirmishes\nthat shape a life and its patterns. While controversy has swirled\naround Freud's rejection of the seduction hypothesis, without the\nscandalous supposition of infantile sexuality there would be no\npsychoanalytic theory of the unconscious. Although some\nrevisionists have argued that Freud abandons his principles and betrays\nhis patients, in fact Freud never abjures the reality of sexual abuse\nor denies that some children are molested. Rather, the\ntransformation in his thinking concerns the aetiology of hysteria in a\ndiagnostic sense; neuroses are no longer said to originate in\n(presumably rare) childhood sexual violence, and thus they can be seen\nto pervade rather than oppose whatever might be considered normal\nsexual development. In discarding the idea of a primary or\nontological innocence of the psyche which is then violently imposed\nupon from the outside, Freud arrives at the fundamental premise of\npsychoanalytic thought. \n\nThe exemplar of this phantasmatic activity of the unconscious is the\nOedipal Complex. In Freud's later writings on femininity,\nincluding “Femininity” (1933), “Female\nSexuality” (1931), and “On the Psychological Consequences\nof the Anatomical Distinction between the Sexes” (1925), Freud\npostulates that the little girl's Oedipal Complex runs a\ndifferent course than the little boy's and holds a different\nrelation to castration anxiety. Crucially, Freud maintains that\nfemininity cannot be grasped from a biological or conventional\nperspective (Freud 1968 [1933], 114). Another way of putting this\nis that sexual difference is centrally concerned with psychical reality\nrather than material reality, with the realm of fantasy rather than\nnature or culture. The Oedipal story is the story of psychic\ndevelopment, the story of how we become subjects and in becoming\nsubjects, how we become sexually differentiated. \n\nThe boy and the girl start off, pre-Oedipally, in the same emotional\nplace, attached to the mother, and it is because of this shared\nstarting point that Freud claims the little girl is a little man; they\nare not yet distinct or sexually differentiated. It is for this\nreason as well that Freud maintains the idea of a single, masculine,\nlibido: the libido is not neutral in Freud's view since its\noriginal object is the mother and this desire for the mother is\nassociated by Freud with masculinity and activity, just as he\nassociates infant clitoral pleasure with phallic enjoyment. Still\nFreud acknowledges that in the libido's most primordial stages,\nthere can be no sexual distinction. It is not until children pass\nthrough the Oedipal Complex that they can properly be said to have a\ngenital organization since this is acquired through a relation to\ncastration and is the last stage in sexual development (following oral,\nanal, and phallic stages). Hence both children at infancy are\n‘little men,’ their desire construed through the terms of a\nsingle masculine libido. \n\nFreud seems genuinely puzzled by how femininity comes about:\ngiven the girl's prehistory of love and attachment to the mother,\nwhy would she switch allegiances to the father? And since, prior\nto genital organization, she too goes through a phallic (masturbatory)\nstage, why would she switch the site of bodily pleasure from the\nclitoris to the vagina? These are among the mysteries he means to\ndesignate when referring to the riddle of femininity. That he\nunderstands it to be a riddle also intimates that he understands sexual\nidentity not as a natural pre-given essence, rooted in anatomy, but\nrather as a form of individuation and differentiation realized through\ncomplex interaction between the bodily drives and familial others.\nThe boy's story is more seamless and continuous since he\nretains his phallic pleasure and, although he must displace the\nimmediate object of his desire (no longer the mother, but someone like\nher), can look forward to substitute objects. The boy's\nOedipal attachment to the mother follows uninterruptedly from a\npre-Oedipal attachment and it is brought to an end by the threat of\ncastration emanating from the father. At the conclusion of the\nOedipal Complex the boy identifies with the father, establishes a\nsuper-ego within, and abandons the immediate object of desire with the\npromise that he too will one day possess a similar object modeled on\nthe mother. But the girl's Oedipal Complex is necessarily\nmore complicated since it can only be instigated by a break from the\npre-Oedipal relation to the mother and is therefore a secondary\nformation. Freud postulates that it is the realization that the\nbeloved mother is castrated that prompts the little girl to turn her\nlove toward her father. For the girl, in other words, castration\ndoes not resolve the Oedipal Complex but leads her to enter it, and for\nthis reason Freud claims that it is never wholly brought to a\nconclusion or demolished, thus accounting, in his view, for\ngirls' weaker super-egos and lesser capacity for\nsublimation. The girl turns from her mother not in fear but in\ncontempt and because of envy for what the mother does not\npossess. The father represents for her neither a threat (she\nfinds herself already castrated) nor the prospect of a fulfilled desire\nin the future (the only replacement for the missing penis is a child of\nher own), as he does for the boy who can identify with him and hope to\neventually have what he has. The father's only promise is\nthus as a refuge from loss, represented by the mother who bears this\nloss and who is at fault for the girl's own. In the\ngirl's Oedipal scenario, the father, unlike the castrated mother,\nstands for the virile capacity of desire itself, which she herself\nlacks but might reclaim through another man's provision of the\nopportunity to have a child. In the trajectory of the\ngirl's Oedipal Complex, femininity is realized as the desire to\nbe the object of masculine desire. \n\nFreud's theories of sexuality and the unconscious implicate\nnot only individual psychology but also the constitution of social\nlife. Formed in ambivalent relation to others, sexuality and\nsexual identity permeate the bonds of civilization and ramify\nthroughout all social relations. In turning his attention to\nbroader cultural questions, Freud offers a story or myth of the origin\nof political structures that parallels and echoes his understanding of\nthe individual psyche. To understand the political import of the\nOedipal Complex, it will be helpful to place it more generally within\nthe scope of Freud's understanding of group psychology. In\nGroup Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (1921), Freud\ncontests any clear-cut opposition between group and individual\npsychology and alleges that human infancy is from the beginning\nimmersed in a world of others. Even in ostensibly individual\npsychology, there is always another involved, as model or object, as\nsite of identification or as object of love. Identification and\nlove, which form the core of identity, are already “social\nphenomena” and, inversely social relations are themselves\npremised on developments that occur in the family. It is thus\nmistaken to sever individual from group psychology as though they were\nnot by nature intermingled or to suppose that there is some kind of\nspecial social instinct separate from the drives that energize the\nindividual. Put another way, the individual subject is neither\nformed wholly independently in a kind of solitary interiority nor\nformed as merely an effect of exterior social forces. \n\nTotem and Taboo (1913) is Freud's attempt to explain\nthe origin of social life, the bonds that, on his account, hold\nmen together, on the basis of psychic phenomena. Freud\nenvisages a primitive pre-political sociality in which a primal horde\nof brothers is oppressed by a powerful father who claims for himself\nall the women, all the enjoyment, available in the community. The\nbrothers are deprived or exiled, and they are motivated to bond\ntogether to overthrow the father; they aim, that is, to kill the father\nand take for themselves his women, offenses that mirror, at a\ncollective level, the Oedipal desires of male children. In\nFreud's story, the father's murder results not in lawless\nfreedom and unlimited access to sexual objects (a fraternal civil war),\nbut rather in the creation of totems and taboos—the primal\nfather becomes a totemic figure, a revered ancestral object, and the\nbrother's actions in killing him and claiming his women are\nreconceived as the prohibited transgressions of murder and\nincest. The two blood taboos that are instituted as law, the\nprohibitions on incest and murder, thus have a common origin and emerge\nsimultaneously, and together they mandate the social processes of\nexogamy (marriage outside one's own kin) and totemism (communal\nbonds of affiliation established through the medium of a common\nancestor). Freud thereby allies political formation with the two primal\nwishes of children and the two crimes of Oedipus, predicating exogamy\non the incest taboo, and fraternal bonds on the sacralization of life\nand the prohibition on murder. Totemism and\nexogamy also entail fraternal equality: in order that no one take the\nplace of the father and assume his singular power, the brothers are\nequally constrained and equally respected, the distribution of women\nequally allotted. Depicting the creation of a stable society\ngrounded in law (though founded in violence), Freud's tale serves\nas a paradigm for not only rudimentary, but also enduring and\ncontemporary, political relations, which he views as rooted in\nunconscious drives but oriented toward achieving a stabilization or\nequilibrium of those drives at the communal level. In\nFreud's narrative, it is the father/son relationship that matters\nfor the establishment of this semi-stable political relation, a band of\nbrothers with equal rights. This lineage founds political order\nin murderous fraternity, with women as objects of exchange not\ncitizen-subjects. \n\nMoreover, in explaining the advent of lawful existence, Freud\nidentifies something recalcitrant, intractable in social\narrangements—a kind of self-assault (the super-ego) that links\npleasure with aggression, and thus that carries a potentially\ndestabilizing force. The sons' attitude toward the father is one of\nambivalence, hatred qualified by admiration, murder followed by guilt\nand remorse. The brothers commemorate this loss and maintain their\nbond with one another in the public ceremony of the totem meal where\ntogether they consume a common substance (the father's body\ntransubstantiated into the sacrificed totem), and thereby affirm their\nfellowship and mutual obligation. This confirmation of shared paternal\nsubstance and kinship, and the collective affect of love, loss, guilt,\nand mourning, maintains ties of identity. The law that emerges from\nthe father's murder ritualizes and enforces his edicts, forbidding\nmurder and incest in the public realm, and takes hold internally in\nthe superegoic 'no' of prohibition, producing a permanent sense of guilt\nthat drives civilization and renders it a perpetual\nsource of discontent. Women, however, appear not as subjects of the law but\nas objects of its exchange; moreover, given the indefinite\nprolongation of their Oedipal Complex, women will be more likely to be\nhostile to the edicts of civilization insofar as these infringe upon\nfamily life. \n\nThe relation between father and son is also contained, if concealed,\nin the account Freud offers in The Ego and the Id (1923) of\nhow the ego emerges. There Freud writes that identification is\n“the earliest expression of an emotional tie with another\nperson” (Freud 1968 [1923], 37), i.e., it is prior to\nobject-cathexes or relations of desire. The primordial libidinal,\nbut non-objectal, attachment is with the father of “personal\nprehistory” (Freud 1968 [1923], 37). The subsequent and recurring\nretreat from object-cathexis (investment of instinctual energy in an\nobject) to identification (withdrawal of that energy into the self), is\nthe primary mechanism of ego-formation, taking the lost object into\noneself. Since the ego is the “precipitate” of\nabandoned objects, it is configured through loss, in a melancholy\nreabsorption that incorporates via identification objects from which\nthe ego would otherwise be exiled. Just as the father retains\ndominance in political life after his death, so he dominates psychic\nlife even prior to the ego's formation. In Freudian theory,\nthe father's reign is pervasive, his sovereignty extended in\nevery domain. Freud's privileging of paternal and fraternal\nrelations provides the impetus for much of psychoanalytic feminism, as\nwill be discussed below. \n\nEven in Freud's circle, not all analysts agreed with\nFreud's assessment and there were debates concerning\nwomen's sexuality and the roles of castration and penis envy\ntherein, notably among Karl Abraham, Ernest Jones, Helene Deutsch, and\nKaren Horney. Horney in particular argued for an inherent\nfeminine disposition that is not merely a secondary formation premised\non castration and she took issue with the ostensible effects of penis\nenvy and women's supposed feelings of inferiority. As with\nsome later feminist criticisms of Freud, Horney attempted to retrieve\nfemale sexuality, and by extension a valid form of feminine existence,\nby appealing to a genuinely independent nature and holding culture\nculpable for women's subordinate status. By thus\nreasserting the primacy of biological and social forces, however,\nHorney disputes precisely the idea that is central to Freud's\nhypothesis and that marks psychoanalysis as a unique field of inquiry,\nthat of a distinctive psychical realm of representation that is\nunconscious. \nSomewhat later, Simone de Beauvoir addressed the discourse of\npsychoanalysis in The Second Sex (1989 [1949]), devoting an\nearly chapter to her distrust of “The Psychoanalytic Point of\nView” (Beauvoir 1989, 38–52). Like Horney, Beauvoir\ndenounces Freud's idea that there is but one, masculine, libido\nand no feminine libido with “its own original nature”\n(Beauvoir 1989, 39). Freud, in her view, takes for granted what\nhe needs to account for, namely the value placed on virility.\nBeauvoir takes Freud to task for not considering the social origins of\nmasculine and paternal power and privilege and deems his theory\ninadequate to account for woman's otherness. If women envy\nmen, she argues, it is because of the social power and privilege they\nenjoy, and not because of anatomical superiority. Unlike the\ndeterminisms and objectifications of human life offered by biological\nscience (which treats human beings as determinate objects in the\nnatural world and thus not as free or self-determining subjects with\nagency), but similar to the “economic monism” of historical\nmaterialism (Beauvoir 1989, 52), psychoanalysis is characterized by\nBeauvoir as “sexual monism” (Beauvoir 1989, 52): everything\nin its purview is interpreted through a single lens. Beauvoir\nindicates at the opening of the chapter that psychoanalysis offers a\nperspective which she does “not intend to criticize as a\nwhole” (Beauvoir 1989, 38), especially since it does understand\nthat “no factor becomes involved in the psychic life without\nhaving taken on human significance” (Beauvoir 1989, 38), but she\nquestions both its dogmatic reliance on determinate elements of\ndevelopment and its “embarrassing flexibility on a basis of rigid\nconcepts” (Beauvoir 1989, 38). Most seriously, in\nBeauvoir's view, psychoanalysis allots to women the same destiny\nof self-division and conflict between subjectivity and femininity that\nfollows from social dictates and biological norms. Psychoanalysis\npresents the characteristics of femininity and subjectivity as\ndivergent paths, incompatible with one another. Women might be\nable to be full persons, subjects with agency, but only at the expense\nof their femininity; or they can embark on the course of femininity, but\nonly by sacrificing their independence and agency. This either/or\nbetween the masculinization of subjectivity and the submission to\nfemininity retains the moral, political, and metaphysical opposition\nbetween free self-creation and corporeal incarceration that precludes\nthe possibility of being both a woman and a subject. \n\nBeauvoir alleges that psychoanalysis holds women to a fixed destiny,\na developmental and teleological life process, precisely insofar as it\ndefines subjects with reference to a past beyond their control.\n By assigning to women an essence or determinate\nidentity, the psychoanalytic reliance on sexual categories once again\nrenders woman as the other to a subject rather than a subject herself,\nand thereby denies her existential freedom. In Beauvoir's view,\nhowever, if women are not themselves subjects, but that in contrast\nwith which men's subjectivities are constituted, they are still\nfreely responsible for this situation, insofar as women collaborate in\nthis process by seeing themselves through the eyes of men, justifying\ntheir existence through their romantic relationships, and attempting to\nmirror men's being. By casting women's otherness as\nan effect not only of their social situation (with its power\nrelations), but also of their choices (and hence responsibility), Beauvoir\npreserves women's freedom, unlike the psychoanalytic discourse\nthat she claims rejects “the idea of choice and the correlated\nconcept of value” (Beauvoir 1989, 45). \n\nBeauvoir's misgivings about Freud's account of\nfemininity stem from two sources, a feminist suspicion that women, in\npsychoanalytic discourse, are understood on the basis of a masculine\nmodel, and an existentialist conviction that human\nbeings are self-defining, choosing themselves through their\nown actions. Following her existentialist convictions, Beauvoir\ninsists that even when women abdicate their freedom, they do so as\nagents responsible for their own destinies, not merely as passive\nvictims following a developmentally determined fate. Following\nher feminist convictions, Beauvoir recognizes that women's\nchoices may be constrained by powerful social and bodily forces, but\ninsists that women nonetheless bear ultimate responsibility for\nrealizing their own possibilities by emancipating themselves. Her\nreading of Freud is thus largely directed against the perceived\ndeterminism of psychoanalysis and less against the idea of an\nunconscious per se, although she does want to defend the notion of a\nunitary subject at the origin of choice, insisting that “psychic\nlife is not a mosaic, it is a single whole in every one of its aspects\nand we must respect that unity” (Beauvoir 1989, 44), a\nsupposition that certainly limits the affinities between existentialism\nand psychoanalysis. Nonetheless, Beauvoir's dispute with\nFreud appears to be less about whether constraint is part of our being\nin the world, and more about where that constraint is located:\npsychoanalysis locates constraint internally, in the constitution of\nthe psyche itself, not only in the situations of social life, whereas\nBeauvoir locates it externally, in the cultural forces that impact even\nthe most intimate sense of our own agency. Beauvoir thus claims\nthat her own interpretations of women's femininity will disclose\nwomen in their liberty, oriented freely by the future and not simply explained\nby a past. She thereby ratifies the promise of existentialism for\nfeminism. \n\nBeauvoir's own project of elucidating the paradoxical relation\nbetween femininity and subjectivity is nonetheless influenced by\npsychoanalytic concepts and appropriates its theoretical insights in\nvarious ways. The Second Sex highlights the practices by\nwhich women become women through their appropriation of bodily (sexual)\ndifference, as well as the manner in which a human being generally is\nlimited and compelled by bodily and unconscious forces. Indeed\nBeauvoir and Freud seem to agree that one is not born but becomes a\nwoman, i.e., that femininity involves some sort of (social or\npsychical) process rather than a biological or natural given.\nBoth are interested in the ‘how’ of this process, how one\nbecomes a woman, although, as discussed above, they disagree about what\nthis ‘how’ is. Moreover, in her articulation of\nwomen's ambivalent attitudes toward embodiment, sexuality, and\nmaternity, Beauvoir is clearly indebted to the attention psychoanalytic\npractice gives to listening to women's first person narratives,\ninterpreting the emotional impact of events that can not be easily\ncategorized, and heeding attachments that carry both affection and\nresentment. Like Freud, Beauvoir recognizes that we are embodied\nas sexual beings and that our bodies not only testify to our own\nfinitude and limits but also matter as sites of encounters with others,\nencounters that are multivalent—including loving connections\nand threatening defenses, moments of affirmation and of\ndissolution. Beauvoir refuses any political program that demands\nwe deny our bodily possibilities in order to be fully human and\nproclaims that bodies and bodily difference are integral to projects of\nselfhood, and not merely accidental contingencies of a rational and\ndisembodied mind. For Beauvoir, as for Freud, there is no such\nthing as a disembodied, non-sexed human being; any ideal of the human\napart from sexual identity or difference is an abstraction that can\nonly be affirmed on the basis of a mind/body dualism. Femininity\nfor her is not merely a mystification that imprisons women's\nsubjectivity (even if its social construal has had this effect).\nFinally, like Freud, Beauvoir is fully aware of the impact on children\nof their domestic situation, the way familial life resonates with\nmeaning that informs not only intimate relations but relations to the\nlarger world. \n\nBeauvoir's portrayal of living a feminine existence, of sexual\ndifference as an embodied situation, developed through a series of\nphenomenological descriptions, tries to understand how women have been\ncast as other in the drama of masculine subjectivity and doubts the\npremise that this is an historical event, occurring at some definitive\npoint in time. Beauvoir herself has often been (mis)read in a way\nanalogous to her (mis)reading of psychoanalysis, as proferring a\ndeterminate succession of experiences for women, rather than describing\nsocially extant processes. But The Second Sex depicts\nthe effects on women's character of inequitable social\narrangements; it neither proffers a normalized destiny for women nor\npresupposes a common metaphysical identity. \nEven so, in many ways Beauvoir's work is more easily aligned with\nthe sociologically oriented Anglo-American feminists than with Irigaray\nand Kristeva. \n\nIn considering the background of psychoanalytic feminism, a large\nportion of which is rooted in or aligned with what gets called French\nFeminism, the French context of psychoanalytic theory is also crucial,\nand in particular the work of Jacques Lacan. Lacan's work\nhas been both a powerful influence on, and an object of critique for,\nfeminist appropriations of psychoanalysis, and his ideas have been\ntaken up, transformed, and challenged by Luce Irigaray and Julia\nKristeva (both of whom are discussed below), among others.\nLacan's work is both praised for its de-biologization of Freud\nand pilloried for its phallocentrism. These two aspects are in\nfact imbricated, as both hinge on Lacan's elaboration of language\nas a symbolic order that precedes and makes possible human\nsubjectivity. In order to stay focused on the feminist deployment\nof the psychoanalytic theoretical apparatus, I will concentrate first\non Lacan's understanding of the intersection of language and law\nin the symbolic order, and then on his account of the ego's\nformation in the imaginary order. The imaginary and symbolic are\nmodes of representation that make the world and the self\nintelligible. The symbolic is Lacan's term for the way in\nwhich reality becomes intelligible and takes on meaning and\nsignificance, through words; the imaginary refers to the mode of\nintelligibility offered by images. The concordant and conflicting\nmediation of the world by images and words coordinates, or makes sense\nof, reality and instigates both subjectivity and social relations.\nAs with Freud, maternal and paternal figures are central to his\naccount of subjectivity. \n\nLacan characterizes his own work as fundamentally a return to Freud,\nalbeit one that brings the insights of structural linguistics,\nespecially Ferdinand de Saussure and Roman Jakobson, and structural\nanthropology, primarily Claude Levi-Strauss, into the domain of\npsychoanalysis. Even so, his returns are also revisions; he not\nonly retrieves but renovates Freud's central concepts.\nAccording to Lacan, Freud's theory of sexuality anticipates a\ntheory of signification that he could not yet elaborate. The\nanthropological and linguistic lineage of Lacan's thought is\ncentral to this conceptualization of a “symbolic\nuniverse.” Lacan explicitly endorses Levi-Strauss's\nconception of the transcendental law at the origin of human sociality\nas the incest taboo; he writes that “the fundamental or primary\nlaw, the one where culture begins in opposition to nature, is the law\nof the prohibition of incest” (Lacan 1992 [1986], 66–7).\nThe intrusion of language and law institutes a break with nature, one\nthat transfigures the world by imbuing it with meaning. Following\nthe logic of Totem and Taboo, social identities are\nconstituted on the basis of exclusions that establish kinship\nnetworks. These social bonds are maintained through mandates and\nprohibitions (what is required and what is forbidden), and in\nparticular through the mandate of exogamy (with its structures of\nexchange) which determines that “the Oedipus complex is both\nuniversal and contingent” (Lacan 1991b [1978], 33): paternal\nprohibition provides the conditions for human sociality without the\nprohibition itself being innate. Lacan thus accounts for the\ntransgenerational transmission of elementary structures of kinship\nwithout appealing to any natural necessity. Lacan takes this law\nof kinship (dictating desire and its limits) to be fundamentally\nco-terminous with the order of language since it is instituted through\na symbolic articulation. \n\nLacan calls the paternal prohibition (the incest taboo) the\n‘law of the father,’ and he develops the connection between\nlaw and language by way of a pun. In French Non (No) and\nNom (Name) sound alike. The no that prohibits (the\nfather's law) and the name that establishes authority (the\nfather's name or the proper name) are conferred\nsimultaneously. By submitting to the law of the father (his no\nand name) the child assumes a symbolic identity and place in the human\nuniverse of meaning, i.e., the child becomes a subject, bound by law\nand bearer of language. With this compliance, the child takes on\na life of desire and incompletion, pursuing lost objects with no firm\nground or fixed purpose, a lack of plenitude in being that Lacan\ndesignates as castration. \n\nAs discussed above in the section on Freud, Freud understands women\nto be ‘castrated,’ deprived of a penis, and men to live\nunder the threat of castration. Lacan complicates this\ntheoretical perspective by deeming all subjects, all speaking beings,\nto be castrated, by which he means deprived of the phallus, which is\nnot the same as the penis. While the penis is a biological organ,\nthe phallus is a signifier which invokes or points toward other\nsignifiers, or toward a system of signifiers. The moment of\ncastration is the primordial moment of loss, the fracturing of being by\nlanguage. With entry into the reign of law and language, subjects\nare cut off from the immediacy of bodily experience; relations to\nthings, and to oneself and others, are now mediated by words and\nrepresentations. The distinction between phallus and penis can be\nseen to carry forward Freud's own distinction between instinct\nand drive, since in each case the latter term indicates that the\nexperience of the body has meaning insofar as it takes place in the\nmedium of language and in a world of others. \n\nCastration takes place when the child recognizes lack in the mother\nand her maternal omnipotence is annulled. The mother, for the\nchild, ceases to be the all-powerful provider of every satisfaction as\nshe herself is a desiring being deprived of satisfaction. This\nconundrum of maternal desire points elsewhere, toward “the law\nintroduced by the father” (Lacan 2006 [1970], 582). The\npaternal prohibition intervenes to warn the child that s/he is not the\nanswer to the question of the mother's desire. Galvanized\nby the mother's lack, the law of the father (which need not be\nembodied in an actual person) takes the place of the desire of the\nmother, substitutes for it, occludes it. Indeed the paternal\nfunction, working through name and law, indicates a dead father, just\nas Freud understands in Totem and Taboo that the murdered\nfather, the precondition of law, is stronger than the living one.\nIn the Lacanian version of the Oedipal Complex, human beings achieve a\nsexual position by traversing the Oedipal Complex, i.e., by submitting\nto castration, also called the phallic function, and thereby entering\ninto signification. There is thus no sexual difference prior to\nrepresentation. \n\nHere we arrive at the phallocentrism, if not the patriarchalism, of\nLacan's thought, the central role of the phallus in his thinking\nabout subjectivity and sexual difference. According to Lacan, the\nphallus instates the signifier into the subject regardless of any\n“anatomical distinction between the sexes” (Lacan 2006\n[1970], 576). The phallus, in other words, is responsible for the\nchild's passage from immersion in perceptual immediacy to a\nrepresentational domain in which the world takes on meaning. It\nis this claim that de-biologizes Freud, since it articulates the\nfunction of the phallus apart from any particular bodily attributes.\nLacan insists that the phallus is a signifier, not an image or\nbodily organ, and that in relation to it all are castrated. The\nfather's No effectively says to the child ‘you are not the\nobject of the mother's desire’ or ‘you are not her\nphallus, the thing that fulfills her.’ As such, it also conveys\nthe message that the child too is lacking or desiring. Although Lacan\ndistinguishes between a ‘seeming to be’ which characterizes\nfemininity, in the attempt to be the phallus that one is not (to be the\nobject of desire), from a ‘seeming to have’ which\ncharacterizes masculinity in the attempt to have the phallus that one\ndoes not have (to possess the object of desire), he still maintains\nthat everyone is lacking the phallus in some way, either in the mode of\nnot being it or in the mode of not having it. Nonetheless, while Lacan\ncenters human experience not on the supposed biological fixity of\nanatomical distinctions, but on a representational economy, the phallus\nretains its associations with masculinity and remains the focal point\nof sexual identity. \n\nAs already discussed, Freud had theorized that there is only one\nlibido and it is masculine. In “The Signification of the\nPhallus,” Lacan explicitly addresses, and criticizes, the\nalternative view that there might be two libidos, which he satirizes as\na kind of sexual equality, the “equality of natural rights”\n(Lacan 2006 [1970], 577). This is the view I earlier mentioned as\nbelonging to Karen Horney who defends the idea of an inherent,\nunderived, biologically-based, nature of feminine sexuality.\nLacan also disparages the idea that the final stage of genital\nsexuality is directed toward the entire person in his or her\npersonhood, the achievement of a kind of tenderness toward the whole\nbeing of another (Lacan 2006 [1970], 580). Lacan disputes both of\nthese positions as normalizing and biologizing and claims that the\npsyche is not harmonized with nature in either of these ways. In\ncontrast to this fantasy of sexual complementarity, the idea that\nmen's and women's sexual interests converge, Freud, Lacan\nclaims, understood “the essential disturbance of human\nsexuality” (Lacan 2006 [1970], 575), that we are always lacking,\nalways in search of aims and objects, “the deviation of\nman's needs due to the fact that he speaks” (Lacan 2006\n[1970], 579), and that this discordance means also that there is no\nsymmetrical or harmonious sexual relation between well-integrated and\nself-realized men and women. \n\nThis symbolic dimension of human relations must be clearly\ndistinguished from the imaginary as the domain of the ego. The\nimaginary order is most fundamentally and plainly elucidated in\nLacan's essay “The Mirror Stage as Formative of the\nI Function as Revealed in Psychoanalytic Experience,”\nwhere he elaborates Freud's insights in The Ego and the\nId, taking up the idea that the ego is first and foremost a bodily\nego formed through the “projection of a surface” (Freud\n1968 [1923], 27), a visual representation of an external veneer or\nfaçade. Lacan concurs, writing that consciousness occurs\n“each time … there's a surface such that it can\nproduce what is called an image” (Lacan 1991b [1978],\n49). The mirror stage commences, pre-Oedipally, when the infant\nis around 6 months old. The infant at this age is literally\ninfans, without speech and moreover, without bodily\ncoordination or motor control. Born prematurely, at a point prior\nto any adequate capacity for self-care, the infant is wholly\ninstinctually inept. By identifying itself with an image, a\ncoherent unity that contrasts to its own fragmented and dispersed\nbodily existence, the infant forms a preliminary self, one animated by\nan illusion but an illusion that allows it to anticipate its own future\norganization. \n\nLacan's account of the mirror stage establishes the ego as\nfundamentally imaginary, formed through the infant's specular\ncaptivation with the unitary form presented in images of itself which\nit assumes as its own through identification. This perceptual\nimage of coherent bodily contours and boundaries is at odds with the\ninfant's motor incapacity and the “turbulent\nmovements” or fragmented drives that animate its own body and\nprocesses. The ego, with its illusion of self-mastery and\ncontainment, is formed through misrecognition, an anticipatory\nidentification with an idealized, stable, self-enclosed, citadel of\nself. This identification with an image of oneself sets up the\nego as rivalrous, narcissistic, and aggressive. While the act of\nmisrecognition becomes the basis for a sense of self or for\nself-consciousness, it is also an act of alienation, exclusion, or\nself-division; by erecting an imaginary ideal, representing oneself in\na perfected image, the self is also split and rendered unconscious to\nitself, cut off from the multiplicity of dispersed drives. \n\nFor Lacan, the ego is a “knot of imaginary servitude”\n(Lacan 2006 [1970], 80) and thus the site of the subject's\nstagnancy and inertia. The mirror stage also forms the basis of\nLacan's critique of ego psychology; whereas the latter takes\nstrengthening the ego to be the aim of analytic practice, Lacan takes\nthe aspirations of the ego to be a “lure” (Lacan 2006\n[1970], 78) of self-possession, an armor that rigidifies the subject\nand resists freedom and movement, a defensive structure that provides\nan alienating identity. With this theory of the ego, Lacan\npresents a subject at odds with itself, non-self-identical, in\n“primordial Discord” (Lacan 2006 [1970], 78), torn between\nunity and anarchy, organization and chaos, integration and\nfragmentation. The withdrawal of the self from itself proceeds\nfrom the reflexivity of representational practices of language.\nThe ego as object is trapped in oppositional relationships, including\nwith itself, and cannot therefore be equated with the subject as\nspeaking being who, in the use of words, signifiers that are\ndifferentially related to one another, is capable of more complex plays\nof presence and absence; language, unlike perception (I perceive an\nobject or I don't), can evoke simultaneously the presence and the\nabsence of the thing (I can represent objects that are not\npresent). \n\nWhile the advent of the symbolic order is tied to Oedipalization,\nand the imaginary order is tied to the pre-Oedipal period, it would be\nmistaken to think of the imaginary and symbolic in only developmental\nor chronological terms as they are also ongoing structures of\nexperience. Even in the seemingly dyadic relation between mother and\nchild, Lacan argues, a third term is always at work. Initially\nthis third term is simply a question, the question of the\nmother's desire, of what she wants, but already this question\ninterrupts or destabilizes the child's position, rents dyadic\nunity, even as the child takes itself to be this object of desire,\nsince it indicates in a preliminary way that the mother is lacking,\nthat she is not whole, entire, omnipotent. The question of\ndesire, in other words, means that the phallic mother of the imaginary\nis already the castrated mother of the symbolic, and that the imaginary\nunity of the ego, with its oppositional relations, is bound to be\nsublated into a symbolic relation of difference. \n\nIt is important, however, not to conflate the mother with the woman\nor maternity with femininity. Lacan famously declares that\n“there's no such thing as Woman, Woman with a capital\nW indicating the universal” (Lacan, 1998 [1975], 72), a\nmetaphysical concept with determinate and substantive content. In\nasserting that ‘The Woman’ does not exist, Lacan indicates\nthat something of the psyche escapes castration, limitation,\nsignification, and the demands of the law of the father. Symbolic\nand imaginary representations leave something out, hit their limit,\nproduce an impasse that presents a fracture or fissure in the symbolic\norder. While sexual difference is mediated by representation, it\ncannot be fully contained within its terms. \n\nThe idea that sexual difference is not biologically innate but\nestablished through language and law has led some feminists to conclude\nthat Lacan is on the side of social constructionism but this would be\nmistaken. Lacan is adamant that the choice between nature and\nculture is a false one, and that language is not a “social\nphenomenon” (Lacan 2006 [1970], 578). Language and law,\npersonified by the name of the father, are irreducible to social\npractices and processes and are in fact the condition of their\npossibility. While Lacan is criticized for constituting sexual\ndifference on the basis of the phallic function and subjectivity on the\nbasis of paternal authority, what the Lacanian project does provide for\nfeminism is not the idea of a malleable culture, susceptible to human\nmastery, as distinct from a fixed nature that escapes it, but the more\ndisconcerting idea that human mastery, of ourselves, of others, of\nnature and culture, is itself illusory. Rather than the promise\nof a rational progress toward greater and greater equality, respect for\nindividual difference, and universality, Lacan's insights, like\nFreud's, point toward the precariousness of identity and social\nbonds and to the instability of the drives that attach us to one\nanother. Subjectivity and sexuality are not natural adaptations\nbut deviations, detours, breaks from nature that undermine identity and\ndivide or limit any unity of self or community. In addition to\nthe distinctiveness of his method, focus, and insight, this willingness\nto grapple with the limits of self-mastery is one reason why Lacan has been taken\nas an innovative and amenable resource for some feminist theorists.\nIn exposing the inadequacies of social or empirical accounts of\nsexual difference, identity, and the power relations built upon them,\nLacan confronts the fundamental structures at the root of empirical\nsocio-historical circumstances. \n\nFrench Feminism is in many ways a misnomer since the authors thus\ncharacterized are rarely of French origin or nationality (although\nFrench is the predominant language of their writing) and not\nnecessarily overtly self-identified as feminist. The writers\naffiliated with French Feminism, including Luce Irigaray, Julia\nKristeva, Sarah Kofman, Catherine Clement, and Helene Cixous, among\nothers, variously ask about the relation between the maternal and the\nfeminine, doubt that we can say what a woman is, worry about\nFreud's lack of attention to mothers, play with writing style,\nwonder about feminine subjectivity, ask if women can be subjects or\ncitizens without adapting to masculine norms, impeach Lacan's\nphallocentrism, and suspect that access to language assimilates women\ninto neutralized brothers. Unlike Beauvoir, they are\nphilosophically and temperamentally more sympathetic to the split of\nsubjectivity detailed by psychoanalysis, the idea that I am not I, that\nself-division rather than self-identity is the fundamental feature of\nhuman existence, and therefore that the subject is not a unitary point\nof origin for choice. Like Beauvoir, they ask whether the\nstructures of femininity and the structures of subjectivity are\ncompatible, commensurable, reconcilable, and are vexed by the\napprehension that they are fundamentally at odds. While they aim\nto disentangle femininity from maternity, and provide a critique of\ntheir conflation, they also take seriously the significance of\nmaternity for women and for children of both sexes. Because they\nconcede the limits of socio-cultural explanations for women's\nlack of standing in the social contract, and take femininity and the\nfeminine body as points of departure for speech or writing, they have\noften been accused of essentialism. Below I focus on the work of\nIrigaray and Kristeva, examining how they engage with and transform the\nideas of Freud and Lacan, and how they articulate sexual difference as\nintegrally connected to the foundation, and disruption, of a symbolic\norder. \n\nIrigaray characterizes her own project as taking place in three\nstages: first, deconstructing the masculine subject; second,\nfiguring the possibility for a feminine subject; and third, construing\nan intersubjectivity that respects sexual difference (Irigaray 1995a,\n96). Sexual difference, in her view, is not a system of\ndomination to be overcome but a cultural process and practice to be\nachieved and nourished; the actual relations of domination and\nsubordination that characterize Western politics, society, history,\nliterature, language, and law, epitomize for Irigaray the reign of\nsexual indifference, the fraternal order of equal\nbrothers/citizens that is inattentive to the self-division of nature,\nits immanent sexual differentiation. Irigaray's writings\nimplicate Freud in this culture of sexual indifference, his work a\nsymptom of masculine metaphysics and its dream of self-identity and\nself-mastery. I will discuss Irigaray's understanding of\nsexual indifference further below, after first describing and\nelucidating her style of writing. \n\nIrigaray's writing style is often mimetic, an approach that she\nclaims has been “historically assigned to the\nfeminine” (Irigaray 1985b, 76) and therefore that she adopts\ndeliberately in order to “try to recover the place of her\nexploitation by discourse” (Irigaray 1985b, 76).\nIrigaray's writing does not proceed propositionally, laying down\ntheses and supporting arguments, nor is it formulated through\nconventionally linear explanations. This is not to say, of\ncourse, that she does not draw conclusions or that her writing is empty\nof insight. But these insights are reached by mirroring the text\nshe is reading, allowing it to play out its tensions and\ncontradictions, juxtaposing, transfiguring, and intensifying its crises\nand putting its parapraxes (its textual and conceptual slips of the\ntongue) on display. Her writing is driven by the vagaries of the\nauthor before her, and makes appear, or unmasks, the structuring forces\nof the text and its impasses and limits. This reading strategy\ngoes to work on the unconscious logic of a text, revealing the\nauthor's underlying fantasies and anxieties by amplifying and\nreflecting them, and thereby attempting to loosen the masculine hold on\nthe symbolic by conveying its unstated postulates and conversing from a\ndifferent perspective. Intently attentive to the signifer, to the words\nand silences of psychoanalytic texts, she aims to retrieve the bodily\nin language, something underlying symbolic processes of representation,\nand to invent a new language and imagine new forms. \n\nSpeculum of the Other Woman (her dissertation and the work\nthat got her exiled from the Lacanian school) includes “The\nBlind Spot of an Old Dream of Symmetry,” Irigaray's long\nessay on Freud's writings on femininity. Irigaray's\nessay on Freud begins by tackling head-on his articulation of the\nriddle of femininity (Irigaray 1985a, 13) in his lecture on\n“Femininity.” Here already we can recognize both\nIrigaray's unique style and her critical project, and the way\nthese two features of her writing are imbricated and entangled with one\nanother, propelling a distinctively mimetic method of reading,\nrepeating, and reproducing the text, mirroring Freud's speculative\ndiscourse but also transforming and sabotaging its terms. Her\ntext opens as Freud's does, with his words, and is comprised of\nlong quotations that follow the course of Freud's essay.\nInsofar as this appropriation might at first appear as the passive\nlistening of a dutiful daughter, Irigaray performs a kind of masquerade\nof femininity: receptive, submissive, obedient. But this\nperformance does not merely reiterate or reproduce; in exemplifying the\nways in which women have no language of their own, can only speak in or\nthrough the voice of the father, she is establishing the symbolic\nterrain upon which any critique must move while also subverting its\npresuppositions. Her own words are inserted as commentary,\nquestion, counterpoint, breaking open the Freudian text, usurping its\nprivileges, revealing its wounds. By engaging Freud in a\nconversation, she insists on her own status as a speaking subject, and\nnot merely an object of study in support of the expansion of a sexist\nscience. \n\nIrigaray's insistence on her own speech is especially crucial\ngiven Freud's reprimand to women: “you are yourselves\nthe problem” (Freud 1968 [1933], 113). Freud's lecture had\nventured to address the question of sexual difference, and had\nendeavored to complicate rather than simplify our perceptions and\ncertainties concerning its meaning and status. Irigaray, however,\nby retrieving and replaying Freud's voice, attempts to show that\nhe remains caught up in certainties and dogmatisms about sex, so that\nultimately his discourse is one of sexual indifference, as I\nwill discuss next. Freud is thus not the master of\nIrigaray's essay: his words do not so much determine her\ntrajectory as reveal their own (freely) associative character, his own\nunmastery, the egoic and identificatory fantasies that haunt his texts\non femininity. \n\nAccording to Irigaray, Freud's work is sexually indifferent\nbecause of its assumption of a kind of symmetry or harmony between\nmasculine and feminine identities and sexualities. With regard to\nsexual desire, Freud assumes that ‘normal’ women will\ndesire men and be desired by them and thus that each sex can fulfill\nthe longings of the other. With regard to sexual identity, Freud\nmodels the feminine Oedipal Complex on a masculine paradigm and origin,\nwith the feminine as its distorted copy. In both cases, Freud\ncontrives to understand women as the complementary other to men, an\nother modeled on the same. Irigaray considers this to be a monosexual,\nhomosocial economy governed by specular opposition or mirroring. It is\nthis sexual indifference that is referenced in the title of\nIrigaray's essay as “the old dream of\nsymmetry.” But, as also indicated by her title, Irigaray\nbelieves this dream is premised on a “blindspot.”\nFreud characterizes the girl's relation to the maternal figure as\nan “especially inexorable repression” (Freud 1968 [1931],\n226) and views the little girl as a little man; the mother/daughter\nrelation is not seen or apprehended by him. The crime here, in\nIrigaray's view, is matricide and the suppression of maternal\ngenealogies or lines of descent. The law of the father, the\npatrimonial order by which sons inherit the father's name by\nsubmitting to his prohibitions, privileging this name over the maternal\nbody, appropriates even birth to the father. The maternal lineage\nis suppressed. Irigaray argues that this means that a pre-Oedipal\nmother-daughter relationship has not been taken up by the signifying\norder; in fact that order retroactively denies that such a relation\never existed, since a daughter becomes a daughter properly, becomes\nfeminized or sexually differentiated (as a girl or woman), only post-Oedipally. In\nLacanian terms, Freud excludes the mother/daughter relation from the\nsymbolic order. Not only is the maternal connection lost or\nrepressed, but the ability to name or identify the loss as a loss is\nalso barred. Banished from memory, the loss of the mother cannot\nbe mourned. Irigaray claims that it is this genealogical\nasymmetry, with the father's name memorialized and the\nmother's body sacrificed to it, that sustains the legitimacy of\npatriarchy and propels the fantasy of a harmony of sexual difference,\nthe conviction that the sexes are reciprocal and complementary in their\nidentities and desires. \n\nSexual difference, in Irigaray's reading of Freud, is thus\nsubsumed under or derived from “the problematics of\nsameness” (Irigaray 1985a, 26) and oriented by the fantasy of\nauto-genesis, being one's own origin, an ideal of self-mastery\nthat is not threatened by any real difference. Freud's\naccount of sexuality presupposes that the sexual subject is male, and\neven that there are no women, only mothers or those destined to become\nmothers, that is that the meaning of being a woman is fully exhausted\nin the meaning of being a mother. In the psychical pre-history of\nthe little girl as elaborated in the idea that “the little girl\nis a little man” (Freud 1968 [1933], 118), she will not have been\na daughter. As little girls diverge from little boys, as they\ncease to be little men, they are expected to be appealing visual\nobjects, the mirror of men's desires, enabling men to represent\nthemselves, shore up their self-image with an adoring reflection.\nIrigaray sees in this account a masculine desire for women's\ndesire to be directed toward men. Women are expected to provide the\nmirror that supports men's projects, nurtures and nourishes their\nidentities, energizes their drive for mastery, by presenting themselves\nas an alter ego. This imaginary, specular, order is matricidal,\nfeeding on the blood of women, leaving unpaid its fundamental debt to\nthe mother, and abandoning the subjectivity of the daughter. By\nrepressing dependence on the maternal origin of life, the masculine is\nmarked as originary, that from which differentiation proceeds. What\nfunctions as a primal loss for boys/sons, the cause of their desire,\ncan only function as a gap in language, an absence of meaning for\ngirls/daughters, an exile from desire, language, and other women, an\nirretrievable void that cannot be recuperated in language because it is\ninstigated by language, by the entry into symbolic order called forth\nby the paternal prohibition of the father's no/name.\nIrigaray's concern is that for Freud, the mother is only a mirror\nand her relationship is always to a son; there are no mother/daughter\nrelations. Not only is Western culture premised on matricide,\nwhich she claims is more primordial than the patricide of Totem and\nTaboo, but this matricide is forgotten and the mother remains\nunmourned. \n\nRepressing any maternal genealogy, political life has been\npredicated on the lineage between fathers and sons and the bonds of\nbrotherhood, appropriating universality and citizenship to men and\nrendering women as objects of their desire and exchange. The\nexploitation of women is not merely a phenomenon that takes place\nwithin the social order, it is its very foundation and premise.\nIrigaray calls the fraternal order “hom(m)osexuality,”\nmeaning both that it is an order of the same (homo) and that it is the\norder of men (homme): the regime of sexual indifference ignores\nrelations among women, and especially between mothers and daughters,\nand situates women as the medium of men's alliances with one\nanother, as the buried support and energetic reserves of the body\npolitic. This forgetting of the mother supports vertical and horizontal\nrelations between men but leaves women unrepresented in language (as\nsubjects) and incapable of achieving representation in the body politic\n(as citizens). Irigaray's own project thus aims to criticize the\nhom(m)osexual order and its specular economy, to reinvigorate\nmother/daughter relations to make possible a feminine subjectivity, and\nto cultivate sexual difference in the political realm, in civil\nidentity. Developing the resources for transformation, i.e., for\nwomen to become citizens and subjects, entails disrupting the\ntransmission of power between men and rethinking the passage from\nnature to culture represented by the Oedipal Complex. This task\nrequires intervening in the symbolic and imaginary realms, creating a\nnew language that would not be severed from the body and ending the\ndivision of labor between love and law. \n\nThe structure of the representational economy, its association of\nsubjectivity with masculinity, precludes the convergence of being a\nwoman and being a speaking being. Although of course there are\nwords for women, these words constitute her only with reference to\nmasculinity, as a photographic negative of man, or in response to a\npatriarchal exertion of feminine norms and expectations. They\nsecure her in a masculine universe, they say in advance what she is,\nthey render her captive to an idea of feminine essence. By\ncontrast, Irigaray seeks to create a representation for women that\nwould not be a designation of what she is, defining her by and holding\nher to some concrete essence, but would allow her to exist on her own\nterms and speak for herself. Irigaray believes that this type of\nself-determination is barred by the exclusion of mother-daughter\ngenealogies, an exclusion that works to assign woman to a maternal\ndestiny (as mothers of men). Neither denotative nor expressive,\nneither speaking of woman (as though woman were a determinate object of\nstudy) nor speaking as one (as though the aim were to express an inner\nessence), Irigaray's writing establishes a reflexive relation to\nlanguage. By acquiescing, in her mimetic writing style, to the\ncultural expectation of feminine artifice, Irigaray stages her own\nexiled agency and thereby extends the possibilities for being a woman\nto include being not only an object in or reference of language but a\ntransformer of language. Without claiming to say what a woman\nreally is, to get right what the symbolic order gets wrong, she shows\nthat in speaking differently, the very meaning of being a woman (or\nbeing a man) can be transformed, so that sexual difference remains open\nto new possibilities. She thus does not so much refute Freud's\naccount of the Oedipal Complex and the little girl's purported\nmasculinity as re-present its primal crime against women, the Oedipal\nexclusion of maternal dependency, thereby altering the scene of its\nrepresentation. \n\nIrigaray also challenges the Lacanian idea of the law of the father\nand the phallic signifier, pillorying the way in which natural birth\nhas been assigned to maternity while cultural birth is assigned to\npaternity, equating the woman-mother with body and the man-father with\nlanguage and law, and relegating the bodily process of parturition\n(maternity) to mute nature while valorizing the symbolic process of\nlegitimation (paternity) as constitutive of civilization. Human\nsubjectivity has been masculinized, while human flesh is both feminized\nand animalized. Irigaray aims to provoke a legitimation crisis in\nthe paternal legacy and the name of the father that bestows on the\nchild a political and familial identity. \n\nThe erasure of sexual difference enables a metaphysics of substance\nin which sexual identity is a matter of fixed and pre-determined being,\nof underlying essences or common properties, rather than a form of\nbecoming and self-generation. Irigaray's genealogical\naccount of sexual difference resists both the idea of an invariant\nuniversal (and hence sexually neutral) human essence that subtends (and\nthereby expels) human multiplicity and the idea of sexual essences that\nconsist in self-enclosed identities between which there is an\nuncrossable divide. That is, she rejects the ontological\nassumptions of both universal equality and separatism, taking both to\nbe implicitly masculine and patriarchal, bound to a metaphysical\nessentialism that aims to capture diversity in first or final\nprinciples, or to subsume particulars under general concepts.\nChallenging the logic of the one and the many, Irigaray takes the\nself-division of nature, its being-two, as a model of autonomous\nself-development. When Irigaray says that human nature is two, she does\nnot mean that there are two fixed sexual substances, but that to be\nnatural is to be embodied, finite, divided, that the fundamental\ncharacter of nature is growth through differentiation. Human\nnature, in her view, is not disembodied or neutral; it is always\ndistinctively sexed or sexuate, a neologism for sexed, but not\nnecessarily erotic, bodily difference. Viewing the natural body\nas self-differentiating rather than self-identical, Irigaray also\narticulates distinctive capacities for generation corresponding to\ndiffering morphological possibilities (the possibilities of bodily\nform) that entail “different subjective configurations”\n(Irigaray 2001 [1994], 137).  \n\nIf human nature is two, and always divided, Irigaray argues, then\ncivil identity is also two and divided; the two of nature needs to be\nbrought into the two of culture. The one is an illusion of\npatriarchy, while the two threatens the phallocentric order and\nchallenges the supposition that universality must be singular.\nThe scandalous idea of a feminine subjectivity means that the universal\nmust be doubled. Doubling the universal does not, for Irigaray,\nmean merely replacing a neutral universality (something that holds true\nfor all human beings) with two wholly distinct and separate truths. A\nuniversal that has been doubled has also been split or divided from\nitself, no longer one, and Irigaray sees in this the possibility for\ncultivating sexual difference and overcoming a culture of sexual\nindifference that is dependent on the idea of the generic\nhuman. \n\nIf the other has always been formulated on the basis of the same, as\nmerely a specific difference from some underlying generic identity,\nthere has only been complementarity and opposition, there has never\nbeen an actual other subject, each with its own path of development.\nWomen have mirrored men's subjectivities, reflected their\negos back to them in an illusion of wholeness and unity, submitted to\nthe demand that they perform or masquerade femininity. Given this\ncriticism of the exploitation of otherness, and despite her criticism\nof a feminist politics of equality, Irigaray thus cannot be\nsimplistically aligned with the project of difference, if this means\nasserting features of women's biological or social specificity as\nessential and innately valuable attributes, since these Irigaray takes\nto be framed already and in advance by a patriarchal symbolic and\nimaginary order. Irigaray's affirmation of sexual\ndifference does not mean affirming the feminine traits that have been\nascribed to women, since these are actually, in her view, the traits of\nsexual indifference, defined only with reference to men. Sexual\ndifference has yet to appear and it is her task to bring it into\nbeing. \n\nBeing-two is counterposed to the metaphysical alteration between the\none and the many, with its incessant oscillation between the\nessentialism of a rigid identity and the laissez-faire contingency,\nindependent of any determining essence, of unlimited multiplicity and\natomistic individualism. It is on the basis of this being-two\nthat Irigaray attempts to build an ethics of sexual difference, a\npolitical relation between-two, with civil rights appropriate to\nsexuate identity, so that one's identity as a citizen is not cut\noff from the body, and law is not severed from nature. If sexual\ndifference is not simply an effect of oppression, then freedom does not\nmean freedom from sexed embodiment. While political neutrality\ncan only recognize disembodied subjects deprived of their bodily life,\nfor Irigaray, citizens are not abstractions. The doubled,\nnon-neutral, universal allows for distinctively feminine (and\ndistinctively masculine) subjects to be recognized\npolitically. \n\nSimilarly to Beauvoir, who ascertains that language and culture\nconstitute the subject as masculine, and the feminine as other to him,\nIrigaray maintains that inhabiting a feminine subjectivity is\nparadoxical in a fraternal social order. But, for Irigaray, both\nBeauvoir and Freud fail to address sexual difference insofar as they\nretain a singular notion of masculine subjectivity, Freud because he\npresumes the libido is always masculine, and Beauvoir because she\nreckons the aim of women's emancipation as equality with men (for\ninstance by concluding the Second Sex with a call to\nbrotherhood and seeming, arguably, to be calling for women to\nassimilate to masculine norms of selfhood). Irigaray rejects the\nproject of equality, since ‘equality’ can only ever mean\nequality to men, and proposes instead doubling the notion of\nsubjectivity in line with the subject's own self-division.\nThis might seem unnecessary, especially to equality-oriented feminists,\nsince of course, women can, at least in much of the liberal, democratic\nworld, be citizen-subjects, just like men. But Irigaray's\npoint is that women can have the rights of men only so long as they are\nlike men, i.e., insofar as they are brothers, subsumed into the neutral\nindividuality of the liberal social contract. This purportedly\nequal access to citizenship and subjectivity thus does not resolve the\nparadox, since it merely takes the side of subjectivity over that of\nfemininity, retaining the constitution of the feminine as lack, the\ninverted image of man, the other of the same, that which stands in the\nway of political agency and obstructs autonomy, and which thus must be\novercome in order to achieve self-determination. In the\nprevailing social contract, femininity and subjectivity remain\nopposed. \n\nIrigaray does not think she can say what a woman is or what\nfemininity is. Familial, social, and symbolic mechanisms of\nexchange have denied femininity its own images and language, fashioning\nwomen through men's language, images, and desires, and thereby\nproducing an apparent, but false, symmetry within a single, monotonous,\nlanguage. Against this homogeny, with its same and its other,\nIrigaray construes the production or work of sexual difference, sexual\ndifference as a relation between-two, to be the path toward liberating\nboth femininity and masculinity from their metaphysical and political\nconstraints by allowing them each to cultivate their own interdependent\nnatures. The idea of a between-two does not mean a singular path\nthat is shared by both, but rather indicates, in addition to the value\nof a specifically feminine sexual identity and a specifically masculine\nsexual identity, the ethical path of an intersubjective relationality\nthat allows them to appreciate and value one another. Since the\nbetween-two is premised on being-two (self-differentiated), it is in\nthe cultivation of this sexual difference that we will find the\npossibility of an ethical sexual relation, what Irigaray calls an\nethics of sexual difference. For Irigaray, then, contra Lacan,\nthere can be a sexual relation. Irigaray's undertaking thus\ninvolves not merely an assertion of difference against equality, nor\ncertainly a simple reversal; such stances take place on the basis of an\nalready existing symbolic order and imaginary relation and are\nthemselves what need to be interrogated. To find a language for\nfeminine sexuality and feminine subjectivity, we must go “back\nthrough the dominant discourse” (Irigaray 1985b, 119) with its\nmetaphysical assumptions of substance or essence, and its concept of\nidentity which adheres to the regime of sexual indifference. \n\nAlthough Irigaray often invokes the maternal as the source of life\nand subjectivity, she does not equate maternity with femininity or the\nmother with the woman. Among many others, Jessica Benjamin (whose\nwork will be discussed below) seems to share the mistaken view that\nIrigaray's theoretical project is premised upon valorizing\n“female genitals as a starting point for a different\ndesire” (Benjamin 1988, 276). No doubt this\n(mis)interpretation stems from Irigaray's difficult text\n“When Our Lips Speak Together.” But what Irigaray\nmeans by ‘speaking from the body’ is moving away from a\nsingular conception of origin and desire, and most especially the\norigin of desire. Her writing of women's bodies, like her\nretrieval of mother/daughter genealogies is a strategy of language and\nimagination, situating the body as fluid border, the site of the\noverflow of culture into nature and vice versa, rather than a\nself-enclosed egoic center. She is not an essentialist who views\nwomen's biology as their destiny. Instead she challenges\nthe nature/culture divide, and the either/or of biology or\ncivilization. \n\nWhile often grouped together in cursory overviews of so-called\nFrench Feminism, Irigaray and Kristeva have fundamentally disparate\nprojects (and locations in the academy), both with regard to their\ncritical analyses and with regard to their political enterprises.\nWhereas Irigaray was a student of Lacan who breaks with (even as she is\ninspired by) his teachings from her earliest work, Kristeva has a much\nmore ambiguous relationship to his school of thought and was never his\nstudent or attended his seminars. Their respective views can\nperhaps best be captured with respect to their attitude toward the\nsymbolic violence of castration (the Oedipal Complex) and the social\ncontract. As explained above, Irigaray envisions a sexuate\nculture that would overcome the Oedipal demands of a sacrificial\neconomy and restore feminine genealogies to the work of civilization.\nKristeva, by contrast, argues that there is no subjectivity\nbeyond sacrifice and does not believe Oedipus can or should be\novercome. Kristeva and Irigaray do not form a cohort and they do\nnot respond to each other's writings. But they both have\npsychoanalytic training and practices and both attend to the body and\nthe drives, taking up the theme of loss or exile of the mother's\nbody and the impact of matricide on social relations.\nKristeva even (echoing Irigaray) condemns humanism as “the\nfraternity of the same” (Kristeva 1998, 168) and, like Irigaray,\nshe plays with writing style, offering experimental, innovative,\nsometimes imagistic portraits of psychical moods, maternal practices,\nand artistic endeavors. \n\nKristeva's connection to feminist thought is also unsettled\nand volatile, although her focus on questions pertaining to language,\nfemininity, and the maternal body has made her work amenable to\nfeminist interest and development. In her essay\n“Women's Time,” she classifies the feminist movement\ninto three distinct times or generations, each with its own approach to\nand vision of justice. The first generation is universalist in\nprinciple and aspires to give women a place within history and the\nsocial contract; this generation takes equality as its mission and\nasserts women's identification with the dominant values of\nrationality. Kristeva aligns Beauvoir with this project of\npursuing access to universal subjectivity. The second generation\nis reactive, rejecting the idea of assimilation to values taken to be\nmasculine; this generation insists on feminine difference. While\nKristeva does not mention Irigaray, it seems clear that Kristeva would\nalign her with this strategy and the project of recognizing feminine\nspecificity. In Kristeva's view, the first generation is so\ncommitted to universal equality that it denies bodily difference, and\nthe second generation is so committed to difference that it refuses to\npartake of a history it deems to be masculine. The third\ngeneration follows neither the path of fixing identity nor the path of\nneutralizing difference in the medium of universality. Instead it\nembraces ambiguity and non-identity, respecting both the value of\nparticipating in historical time and the ineluctability of bodily\ndifference. The third generation recognizes that it is as\nembodied beings that we enter into the social contract and community\nwith others. \n\nSince Kristeva believes that there is no subjectivity and no\nsociality without the violence of the symbolic contract and the\nsplitting of subjectivity, the feminism that she proposes would not\ntake refuge from this violence either by standing outside history (as\nthe second generation does), or by denying women's bodies and\ndesires (as the first generation does). Taking seriously the\nintransigence of sexual difference, and the violent fractures within\nand of identity, Kristeva advocates feminist support for alienation\nthat would not pretend to reconcile the rupture\nbetween body and law (what Lacan calls castration) and would refuse the\nsolace of identity. Kristeva mentions the bodily experience of\npregnancy, an experience of being split, of being two in one, as\nmanifesting the instability of, and alterity within, identity. \n\nThis insistence on the fragility and precariousness of identity can\nbe grasped in the first instance by looking at Kristeva's\nunderstanding of the drives and language. Kristeva introduces the\nnotion of the semiotic as the affective dimension of language that\nfacilitates its energetic movement. The semiotic is the\nmateriality of language, its tonal and rhythmic qualities, its bodily\nforce. In Kristeva's account, the drives are not simply\nexcluded by language but also inscribed as an alien element within it.\nWhile more primitive than signification, the semiotic\nparticipates in signifying practices. \n\nKristeva's elaboration of the semiotic situates it at a point\nprior to the Lacanian imaginary, i.e., prior to the moment at which the\ninfant identifies with its own ego and distinguishes itself from an\nobject. Still in porous relation to another body, without clear\nborders or limits, the infant is propelled by the anarchic,\nheterogenous, rhythmic flow of drive energy “which has no thesis\nand no position” (Kristeva 1984, 26). Mobile and\nprovisional, moving through the body of the not-yet subject, the\nsemiotic is a chaotic force anterior to language, unlocalizable because\nit courses through an as yet undifferentiated materiality in which the\ninfantile body is not yet distinct from the maternal body.\nKristeva calls this stage pre-thetic since it is prior to the\nreign of propositions, judgments, positions, and theses, these being\nsubsequent possibilities that might arrest or seize a movement that\nalways exceeds them. Since the image is itself a kind of sign, a\nfirst representation, the advent of the imaginary demarcates the first\nthetic break, a break from nature and into the realm of convention.\nWhat Kristeva means by the thetic then includes both the imaginary (the\nmirror stage) and the symbolic (the Oedipal Complex) dimensions of\nLacan. Only with the advent of the thetic phase, the “threshold\nof language” (Kristeva 1984, 45), can there be said to be\nsignification proper along with negation as judgment. In thereby\naltering Lacan's understanding of the imaginary or mirror stage,\nshe attends to the pre-Oedipal mother/child relation in a way he does\nnot, while also elaborating on an underdeveloped theme in Freud's\nwork. \n\nFreud distinguishes between auto-erotism and primary narcissism,\nattributing to the latter a new psychical action. While\nauto-erotism precedes the formation of the ego and the individuation of\nthe self, primary narcissism only ensues with the preliminary\ndevelopment of egoic unity, when the ego is able to demarcate itself\nfrom the surrounding world and take itself for an object. The semiotic\ncorresponds to the diffuse drive energy of auto-erotism and Kristeva\ntakes up Freud's challenge to assess the psychical action of\nego-formation that enables primary narcissism, which she attributes to\na primary identification with the imaginary father. In Tales of\nLove, which jumps off from Freud's claim in The Ego and\nthe Id that identification with the father of individual\npre-history is prior to and more primary than object-cathexis, Kristeva\noffers an original account of the pre-Oedipal period, finding a\npaternal figure there. Since the bond of identification precedes\nany bond with objects, the imaginary father is what makes possible the\ninitial separation between ego and object, or rather proto-ego and\nproto-object. This father is not the first object, but the first\nidentification, making language and love possible, movement within and\namong a world of others. This identification, Kristeva\nhypothesizes, alters maternal space, interrupts it with something\nbeyond its borders. But it also indicates that there is a\npreliminary pre-thetic symbolic capacity at work in infantile\nlife. As the drives expel, detach, or isolate a proto-object, the\nspace of differentiation is supported by identification with the\nimaginary father, who holds it open. The imaginary father is here\nassociated with love (unlike the symbolic father who is associated with\nlaw), an invitation to language and subjectivity, to become a being who\ncan have relations with others. \n\nKristeva accepts Freud's insight that the thetic break, or the\nprohibitory break of the Oedipal Complex and the dead father, that\nfounds law and sociality is violent and murderous (Kristeva 1984,\n70). The capacity for representation transforms our perceptual\nuniverse, entailing that no bodily immediacy is possible, that all\nexperience will be mediated by significatory practices and filtered\nthrough the ego's organization. But although this rent in\nexperience is suffered by the signifying child as a loss to be mourned,\nit is also, Kristeva claims, a gift, the gift of a self that can\nnavigate language. With words and memories available, the child\ncan compensate for the loss of objects in perception (in the exemplary\ncase, learning to endure the mother's absence). On\nKristeva's view, “the structural violence of\nlanguage's irruption as the murder of soma, the transformation of\nthe body, the captation of drives” (Kristeva 1984, 75), is\npreceded by a loving father who makes possible the preliminary\nindividuation of the infant from the mother. Although symbolic\nviolence is integral to the maintenance of a social order, the promise\nof language on Kristeva's account is initially brought forward by\nlove, not by law. Unlike Irigaray, who wants to retrieve the\npre-Oedipal period in order to reclaim feminine genealogies, Kristeva\nwants only to redescribe it in order to reassess its import for\nindividuation and creative self-transformation. She takes\ninfantile matricide (separation from the mother) to be a necessary\ncondition of subjectivity and not a remnant of patriarchal\nviolence. \n\nStill, Kristeva charts differing arcs for the paternal and maternal\nrelationships in the constitution of subjectivity. The imaginary\nfather empowers a new psychic space premised on the distinction between\ninternal and external, self and other. The breaking in of the\nsignifier inaugurates individuation, the assumption of bodily form and\ncorporeal unity, and thereby entails loss of the maternal body.\nIn Kristeva's view, matricide, repression of the maternal body,\nis a necessary event on the way to subjectivity. The bodily\nexchange between mother and child can serve as a barrier to love,\nimprisoning the child in an overwhelming bond. The loving mother\nprovides the first approach to language and law by demonstrating love\nfor an object who is not the child, a third outside this dyad who makes\nthe dyadic relationship itself possible and releases the emotional\npressure of it. The loving father proffers a kind of promise,\neven as he disrupts fusion with the mother, allowing and encouraging\nthe child to represent itself. Kristeva's thought here\nfollows Lacan's idea that a mother whose only object of desire is\nher child will produce a child who cannot move beyond the psychosis of\nbeing the phallus for her. \n\nSignification and language are sites of sublimation, creative\nworkings out of the drives, but they can be stalled by abjection and\nmelancholia which are both preconditions for, but also limits to,\nsubjectification. Kristeva identifies abjection and melancholia\nas sites of psychical (and social) crisis rooted in narcissistic\ndisorder. In them, the tenuous processes of ego-formation risk\ncollapse; faced with difficulty clarifying the boundaries of the self,\nthe subject reverts to ambivalent aggressivity. While Kristeva\nunderstands narcissism to be a fundamental, if unstable, structure of\nthe psyche, abjection and melancholia are problematic relations to the\nmaternal body and its loss (or the malfunctioning of its loss). They\nare experiences of disintegration or dissolution of the ego without\nreorganization, but also of its rabid fortification. \n\nIn Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection, the abject is\ndescribed as neither inside nor outside, neither subject nor object,\nneither self nor other, troubling identity and order with the\ninstability of boundaries, borders, and limits. Kristeva offers\nthe examples of bodily fluids, sweat, blood, pus, milk, as non-objects\nthat are banished in the course of ego-formation. These\nnon-objects also include the mother's body; indeed the maternal\nbody is a privileged site of abjection, as it is that which must be\nexcluded in order for individuation and separation to take place, so\nthat one can distinguish self from other and establish a dyadic\n(imaginary) relation out of undifferentiated maternal space or the\nsemiotic chora, the pre-spatial relation of fluid (although\nnot entirely unregulated) drives. The abject can then also be\ncalled the primally repressed, primal because prior not only to the\nsecondary symbolic prohibition of the incest taboo or Oedipal Complex,\nbut also prior to the establishment of any identity. \n\nThe abject is horrifying, repellent, but also fascinating; it is\nstrange but familiar. The process of abjection is not merely a\nsymptom of phobia or borderline disorder, but a necessary and even\nrecurring ordeal in any subject's transition to identification\nwith the father and accession to language. It is the most archaic\nform of negativity, an exclusion or expulsion which functions by\nsecuring the borders of self, carving a space, marking a divide, out of\nwhich the ego can emerge. Kristeva calls it the violent attempt\n“to release the hold of maternal entity” (Kristeva\n1982, 13) or rather what will have been the mother, since this process\nestablishes the distinction between the maternal body and the infant in\nthe first place, making possible primary narcissism. The abject\nexposes the precariousness of the subject/object divide, the fragility\nof identity, the need to constitute oneself against the threat of, and\ndesire for, dissolution. \n\nAlthough this is not primarily Kristeva's concern, abjection\ncan also be understood as a social phenomenon, one with political\nimplications. The psychically primitive experience of egoic\ninstability can be propelled into the political realm, and be socially\naccentuated or reinforced. In abjection, subjects confront what\nthey must exclude or expel in order to maintain identity, that is, they\nconfront their own dependency, mortality, finitude, and\nmateriality. This strangeness experienced at the porous edges of\nidentity can rebound into troubling relations with others, including\nespecially with others who are perceived as lacking intelligible\nidentity, socially marginal, or refusing cultural assimilation.\nWhile Kristeva's own focus is less on what is abjected than\nthe process of abjection, that is, less on the expelled non-object than\non the violence of separation that brings objects (and others) into\nbeing, her work provides the theoretical underpinnings to ask questions\nabout who bears the burden of abjection, how and why some are figured\nas inhuman, animal, or alien. Her analysis of abjection exposes the\nways in which social life is dependent on jettisoning or containing\ndisorder and disruption, and managing the fear of contamination. \n\nThe confusion of borders, the ambivalent relation to maternal space\nat the outskirts of narcissism, also motivates melancholia. The\nidea of the maternal as the primally repressed recurs in Black\nSun: Depression and Melancholia, where Kristeva claims,\n“matricide is our vital necessity” (Kristeva 1989, 27), the\nfounding partition that facilitates the birth and growth of the\nego. Kristeva praises the child, the “intrepid\nwanderer” who “leaves the crib to meet the mother in the\nrealm of representations” (Kristeva 1989, 41). Maintaining\nthat the organization of the psyche is premised on loss, Kristeva also\nunderstands that the suffering entailed by loss can derail the\nformation of a self, that loss itself can become the dominant reality\nfor some who are unable to establish a secure relation to\nthemselves. While mourning, for Kristeva as for Freud, enables a\nsubject to, gradually and painfully, let go of loss by establishing a\nrelation in language to it, melancholia is a practice which enables the\nsubject to hold onto lost objects, most especially the mother or,\nbetter, the dead (or repressed) mother. The loving father\nfacilitates mourning and linguistic creativity; the deadening mother\ndisables self-creation. The generation of the ego out of\nexpulsion, the division of unity, is not simply a mournful moment, but\nalso potentially a joyous one, in which the advent of language, the\npromise of the father, offers reparation and life with a world of\nothers, so that words can provide the nourishment that the breast\npreviously had. The father makes it possible to fill the void\nwith language and the formation of signifying bonds. \n\nIn Kristeva's understanding of melancholic breakdown, the\nproblem is similar to the one discussed above in the section on\nIrigaray, namely that loss goes unnamed and unmourned but thereby stays\nunprocessed within, leaving the subject stagnant and inert.\nWomen, in Kristeva's view, suffer the loss of creativity, the\nincapacity for sublimation, more severely than men. Women's\naccess to language, and creative self-transformation, is more\nvulnerable to disturbance both because of the (previously discussed)\ninexorable repression of their pre-Oedipal relation to the mother and\nbecause they have greater difficulty establishing a primary\nidentification with the father. Whereas the loss of the archaic bond\nwith the maternal body is (potentially) sublated by men into the\nrhythms of language, for women it often becomes a dead space where once\nthere was life, filled only with loss and emptiness. Imprisoned\nby an undead, unmourned, mother, excluded from language or\nrepresentation, women are vulnerable to the devastations of symbolic\nsacrifice without recompense. \n\nPsychoanalysis is presented as a counter-depressant, as are art and\nwriting, able not only to keep the drives or semiotic forces moving\nthrough language but also to foster their revolutionary potential to\ntransgress symbolic limits and laws and to creatively rework self and\nsociety. Accessing the drives and rhythms that symbolic law and\norder typically repress, psychoanalytic practice, like the poetic text,\nrevitalizes or reactivates the semiotic chora, a connection to\nthe maternal body or to femininity. Such practices let loose the\ndisorganizing energies of the body, the pleasurable rupture of sense\nand nonsense. They take productive advantage of the dialectical\ndiscord between semiotic and symbolic and thus keep this discord\noriented toward dissent and protest rather than inner collapse. \n\nAlthough the semiotic resists the symbolic order, or cannot be\ncontained by it, the two are always entangled and imbricated in\nlanguage; drives both support and subvert the symbolic operation,\nbringing bodily rhythms and forces to signification, both impelling and\npulling apart its organization and stases. This disruptive\npotential of semiotic drives and rhythms is associated with negativity\nas a force of revolt, an excess, most archaically, the force of bodily\nexpulsion, but more generally the forces that continually spur the\ndissolution of one's own organization. Negativity maintains life,\nkeeps it going by circulating energy, rendering the subject always in\nprocess. Through its movement, the subject is not a rigid\nidentity, but always developing, reconfiguring itself through the\ninterplay of drives and language, in the tensions between body and\nmirror image and between mirror image and self. \nWhile Kristeva advocates for ‘poetic revolution,’ (meaning\nthe ongoing process of reconfiguring language and oneself by exploiting\nthe heterogeneities between semiotic and symbolic elements), she is\nsometimes read as a conservative thinker because of her commitment to\nmaintaining a symbolic order and social contract. The danger of a\ntoo strong or too weak symbolic order is that it encourages a return to\nabjection or melancholia, to the point prior to ego-formation, to a\ndissolution of the borders that maintain social life and creative\nsubjectivity, contributing to the ego's collapse into an empty\nabyssal void and discouraging semiotic creativity. Such a\nfragile, fragmented, disintegrating ego, always in search of objects to\nheal the rift of being, dreaming of a return to unity but suffering the\nnightmare of upheaval and collapse of identity, is especially\nsusceptible to the traumatic impact of encountering the stranger, the\nunfamiliar other or alien who provokes turmoil and who is repudiated in\na rebound to delirious narcissism and a reassertion of self-mastery and\nself-identity. The stranger disturbs boundaries, indicating the failure\nto fully eliminate the refuse of identity and purify oneself.\nKristeva sees in the ethics of psychoanalysis, premised on\nself-division, being strange to oneself, the possibility of\nestablishing an ethical relation to alterity, inviting it into our\npolitical bonds (and warding off the most virulent forms of\nabjection). Where Irigaray aims to introduce sexual difference\ninto the social contract and the domain of law and rights, Kristeva\nproposes that we introduce self-discord. \n\nThere are a number of Anglo-American (and Australian) feminist\ntheorists and scholars who read Lacan and laid the groundwork for the\npassage from French to English and from France to the US, Britain, and\nAustralia in the 1970's, 1980's, and early\n1990's. Among these are Juliet Mitchell (Psychoanalysis\nand Feminism), Teresa Brennan (The Interpretation of the\nFlesh: Freud and Femininity), Elizabeth Grosz (Jacques Lacan:\nA Feminist Introduction), Jane Gallop (Reading Lacan and\nThe Daughter's Seduction), and Jacqueline Rose\n(Sexuality in the Field of Vision). While writing in\nEnglish, these theorists take their bearings from the French Lacanian\napproach to psychoanalysis and can generally be classified in the field\nof what today gets called “Continental\nFeminism.” Responsible for revitalizing\npsychoanalysis for feminist thought and countering earlier feminist\ndismissals, they aim to reclaim Freud's central analyses for\nfeminist purposes. Juliet Mitchell, for instance, develops the\ninsight indispensable to any feminist reading, that\n“psychoanalysis is not a recommendation for a\npatriarchal society, but an analysis of one” (Mitchell\n1973, xiii). Mitchell and Rose are also the co-editors of\nFeminine Sexuality, a selection from Lacan's seminars,\nfor which both editors wrote influential introductions. \n\nThis section will address, however, not the Lacanian inspired\nfeminist appropriation of psychoanalysis in the English speaking world,\nbut the Anglo-American development of feminist psychoanalysis that has\ndescended from and is indebted to British object relations theory and\nits focus on the pre-Oedipal mother-child bond, especially the work of\nMelanie Klein and Donald Winnicott. Authors who work in this vein\ninclude Nancy Chodorow (The Reproduction of Mothering),\nDorothy Dinnerstein (The Mermaid and the Minotaur), and\nJessica Benjamin (Bonds of Love and Like Subjects, Love\nObjects). What distinguishes this Anglo-American tradition\nfrom the French-influenced one is its emphasis on pre-Oedipal sociality\nor intersubjectivity and its focus on the values of integration,\nharmony, and wholeness, as opposed to those of self-division and\nrespecting the alien within. \n\nThe remainder of this section will focus on the work of Benjamin as\nexemplary of the Anglo-American approach, and clarify its differences\nfrom and similarities with the French approach. Like Irigaray,\nBenjamin is perturbed by the psychoanalytic depiction of social life as\nthe world of men, developed on the basis of the father-son relation and\nits aggression, hostility, love, and mourning. Deploring this\n“struggle for power” (Benjamin 1988, 6) in\nwhich women are merely the triangulating object of desire, Benjamin\nargues that, in the formation of identity, subjects become bound by\nlove to oppressive social relations. She worries that\n“domination is anchored in the hearts of the dominated”\n(Benjamin 1988, 5), that women are erotically attached to patriarchal\npower, and she believes that psychoanalysis can help explain how and\nwhy this is so. Psychoanalysis thus offers to Benjamin insights\nnot only into the individual psyche but also into the organization,\nstructure, and distribution of political power and hierarchy. Her\naim is “to grasp the deep structure of gender as a binary\nopposition which is common to psychic and cultural\nrepresentations” (Benjamin 1988, 218). Unlike Kristeva and\nIrigaray, both of whom problematize the duality and comprehensiveness\nof the nature/culture distinction, and emphasize transformation of\nsymbolic bonds, Benjamin highlights the role of (contradictory)\ncultural stereotypes in bringing forth gender as we know and live it,\nand emphasizes the need for social transformation. \n\nTaking what she calls an eclectic approach, and eschewing\nmethodological orthodoxy with regard to Freudian metapsychology and the\ntheory of the instincts, Benjamin establishes her project on the basis\nof a two person relational perspective, with the other as a separate\nindependent subject. Rather than an undifferentiated unity\ngoverning early infantile life in the pre-Oedipal period, which would\nmake of the infant merely a “monadic energy system”\n(Benjamin 1988, 17), she maintains that a genuine duality and\nrelationality exists from the start and that the process of growth\nentails development within relationships rather than a development of\nthem. The infant, she postulates, is a fundamentally active and\nsocial creature, reaching out to the world and expressing a desire for\nrecognition. The knots of identity are formed via the interplay\nof this desire with the response of another who variously affirms or\ndefies the child. Benjamin claims that this emphasis on sociality\nand intersubjectivity is not intended to disregard the intrapsychic\nelements of subject formation, and in fact she argues for “the\ninteraction between the psyche and social life” (Benjamin 1988,\n5). She holds that the inner and the outer are not competitive\nbut complementary theoretical perspectives. Nonetheless, she does\nwant to situate identity generally, and gendered identity more\nspecifically, within the purview of the subject's multiple and\nambiguous social identifications. \n\nDomination, she argues, ensues from the failures of recognition\nbuilt into the political and social order, not merely failures that\ntake place at the personal or individual level in a single\nrelationship. Borrowing an initial insight from Foucault,\nBenjamin looks at the way power shapes and forms identities and\ndesires, producing gendered relations (Benjamin 1988, 4).\nBorrowing another insight from Hegel, Benjamin depicts the dialectic of\nrecognition in the struggle for identity as a “conflict between\nindependence and dependence” (Benjamin 1988, 33). In her\nview, however, the Hegelian tale, like the Freudian one, erroneously\nbegins with a “monadic, self-interested ego” (Benjamin\n1988, 33) and it thus concludes with the inevitability of breakdown and\ndomination. According to Benjamin, Winnicott resolves the\nHegelian and Freudian dilemma (Benjamin 1988, 38), the solitary egoism\nof the fight to the death, by reformulating the problem of recognition\nat the level of fantasy and distinguishing between internal and\nexternal worlds. The infant feels confident in asserting its\nindependence, and destroying its object in fantasy, so long as that\nobject is discovered to have a secure external existence in reality.\n In other words, the fantasy of destruction is\nappeased by its failure; the infant destroys internally but externally\nis relieved to still have an object to address and interact with.\nMore particularly, the infant destroys or separates from the mother\ninternally and in fantasy, but simultaneously retains a relation to her\nexternally and in reality. The good enough mother must foster\nthis relationship between two separate egos, neither allowing the child\nto succeed in destroying or dominating her, nor allowing herself to\nsquash the child's nascent attempts at self-assertion. The\nmother-child relation is then a kind of revised neo-Hegelian struggle\nfor power, retaining the aim of mutual recognition or respect, but\nrisking domination and rebellion. The violent conflicts within\nare not repressed but neutralized and pacified in the reality of\nintersubjective life that affirms and recognizes autonomy. \n\nAsking, as do Chodorow and Dinnerstein, about the genesis of\npatriarchal power, Benjamin concludes, as they also do, that a main\nsource or component lies in exclusive childrearing by women/mothers,\nwhich occasions the related risks of collapsing maternal authority into\nmere dominance, supporting the fantasy of maternal omnipotence,\ncentering potent ambivalence on the mother, and fostering rigid gender\nidentities and identifications. While the boy attains autonomy\nvia loving identification with the father and separation from the\nmother, the girl's relation to paternal power is complicated by\nits inaccessibility to her. If she seeks “liberation in the\nfather” (Benjamin 1988, 99), she connects her femininity to\nsubmission rather than agency, and attaches to masculinity as an\nidealized object of love (and as its love-object), conferring on it\nvalue while devaluing the mother, and creating a divide between\nfeminine sexuality and autonomous subjectivity. Benjamin argues,\nhowever, that the “protean impersonality” (Benjamin 1988,\n216) of male domination cannot be addressed by a critique that focuses\nsolely on the family and childcare and that power relations cannot be\novercome solely through a transformation in caretaking roles, although\nthe equation of women with motherhood is certainly one component of the\nproblem. If gendered identities are encouraged by social power\nrelations—masculinity is developed as a denial of dependency and\nassertion of independence, while femininity is developed in an\nidentification with nurturing and concession of autonomy—then\nreal transformation requires attention to social roles and\n“cultural representations” (Benjamin 1988, 217), since\n“the core feature of the gender system—promoting\nmasculinity as separation from and femininity as continuity with the\nprimary bond—is maintained even when mother and father\nparticipate equally in that bond” (Benjamin 1988, 217). In\nBenjamin's theoretical model, children are responsive not only to\ntheir social environment, but also to ideas with opaque meanings\n(mandates, expectations, prohibitions, exhortations, etc.) that are\noften covertly, indirectly, or unknowingly conveyed in parental\nlanguage and edicts. Gender equality thus requires that women be\nrecognized, by themselves and by men, as subjects in culture and that\nintersubjectivity itself be revalued. \n\nBenjamin's analysis can be distinguished from those of\nIrigaray and Kristeva precisely by the way in which it tends to\nconflate or collapse the distinction between representation and social\nroles. While Anglo-American psychoanalytic feminism theorizes gender as\nderived from or dependent on social (including familial) inequalities\nand power relations, and thus aims to reduce its psychic effects by\nredressing social and familial domination/subordination, French\nfeminism does not calibrate the psyche on socio-cultural relations but\non imaginary and symbolic representations. Benjamin's\npartitioning of intrapsychic life into internal and external relations,\nand her vision of intersubjective equilibrium is, in contrast to\nIrigaray and Kristeva's assertion of discord within and between\nsubjects, oriented by the conviction that social harmony is desirable\nand attainable. \n\nPsychoanalysis presents a critical and diagnostic project, not\nnecessarily a normative or liberatory one. In developing a theory\nof the drives and the non-rational forces that move and impel us, the\nidea that we are opaque rather than transparent to ourselves, incapable\nof complete self-knowledge or self-mastery, psychoanalytic theory also\nchallenges the rationalist, humanist ego and proposes that our ethical\ncharacters and political communities are not perfectable, exposing the\nprecariousness of both psychic and political identity. The\nunconscious cannot be assumed to be inherently either a transgressive\nor a conservative force, but an unreliable one, promoting revolt or\nrebellion sometimes, intransigence and rigid border preservation at other\ntimes.  \n\nAlthough they are in often uneasy alliance, the\npsychoanalytic account of the unconscious provides feminist theory with\nresources for both political and ontological inquiry.\nOntologically, psychoanalysis offers a distinctively psychical\nunderstanding of sexual difference, how we come to inhabit our bodies\nand our identities, and misinhabit them, an analysis reducible to\nneither social nor biological categories. Politically,\npsychoanalysis offers a depiction of the forces that impel us to\norganize, disorganize, and reorganize the bonds that hold us\ntogether. By offering insight into the formation of subjectivity\nand the animating fantasies of social life, psychoanalysis thus also\nfacilitates feminist analysis of the obdurate elements of patriarchal\nsocial relations, including the symbolic bonds and internal forces that\nundergird identity and attach sexed subjects to relations of dominance\nand subordination. Psychoanalytic feminist attention to the core\nconstituents of civilization, to the nuclei of sexual difference and\ncommunal affiliation, helps explain the perpetuation of masculine power\nand enables feminist theorists to articulate possible correctives,\nchallenges, routes of amelioration, or ethical interruptions that go to\nthe roots of political life and to its beyond and do not simply operate\non the given social terrain.","contact.mail":"zakinea@muohio.edu","contact.domain":"muohio.edu"}]
