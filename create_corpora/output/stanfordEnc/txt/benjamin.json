Primarily regarded as a\nliterary critic and essayist, the philosophical basis of\nBenjamin’s writings is increasingly acknowledged. They were a\ndecisive influence upon Theodor W. Adorno’s conception of\nphilosophy’s actuality or adequacy to the present (Adorno 1931).\nIn the 1930s, Benjamin’s efforts to develop a politically\noriented, materialist aesthetic theory proved an important stimulus\nfor both the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory and the Marxist poet\nand dramatist Bertolt Brecht.  \n\n\nThe delayed appearance of Benjamin’s collected writings has determined\nand sustained the Anglophone reception of his work. (A two-volume\nselection was published in German in 1955, with a full edition not\nappearing until 1972–89, and a 21-volume critical edition has been in production since 2008; English anthologies first appeared in\n1968 and 1978, and the four-volume Selected Writings between\n1996 and 2003.) Originally received in the context of literary\ntheory and aesthetics, only in the last decades of the 20th century did the philosophical depth and cultural breadth of Benjamin’s thought begin to be fully appreciated. Despite the voluminous size of the secondary literature\nthat it has produced, his work remains a continuing source of\nproductivity. An understanding of the intellectual context of his work\nhas contributed to the philosophical revival of Early German\nRomanticism. His philosophy of language has played a seminal role in translation theory. His essay on ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Its\nTechnical Reproducibility’ remains a major theoretical text for\nfilm theory. One-Way Street and the work arising from his\nunfinished research on nineteenth century Paris (The Arcades\nProject), provide a theoretical stimulus for cultural theory and\nphilosophical concepts of the modern. Benjamin’s messianic\nunderstanding of history has been an enduring source of theoretical\nfascination and frustration for a diverse range of philosophical\nthinkers, including Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben and, in a\ncritical context, Jürgen Habermas. The ‘Critique of\nViolence’ and ‘On the Concept of History’ are\nimportant sources for Derrida’s discussion of messianicity, which has\nbeen influential, along with Paul de Man’s discussion of allegory, for\nthe poststructuralist reception of Benjamin’s writings. Aspects of\nBenjamin’s thought have also been associated with a revival of\npolitical theology, although it is doubtful this reception is true to\nthe tendencies of Benjamin’s own political thought. More recently,\ninterest in Benjamin’s philosophy of education has been fueled by the\ntranslations of his Early Writings in 2011 and the\ntranscripts of his radio broadcasts for children (Radio\nBenjamin) in 2014.\n\nWalter Bendix Schoenflies Benjamin was born on July 15, 1892, the\neldest of three children in a prosperous Berlin family from an\nassimilated Jewish background. At the age of 13, after a prolonged\nperiod of sickness, Benjamin was sent to a progressive co-educational\nboarding school in Haubinda, Thuringia, where he formed an important\nintellectual kinship with the liberal educational reformer Gustav\nWyneken. On his return to Berlin, he began contributing to Der Anfang\n(‘The Beginning’), a journal dedicated to Wyneken’s\nprinciples on the spiritual purity of youth, articles which contain in\nembryonic form important ideas on experience and history that continue\nto occupy his mature thought. As a student at the universities of\nFreiburg im Breisgau and Berlin, Benjamin attended lectures by the\nneo-Kantian philosopher Heinrich Rickert and the sociologist Georg\nSimmel, whilst continuing to be actively involved in the growing Youth\nMovement. In 1914, however, Benjamin denounced his mentor and withdrew\nfrom the movement in response to a public lecture in which Wyneken\npraised the ethical experience that the outbreak of war afforded the\nyoung. In 1915 a friendship began between Benjamin and Gerhard (later\nGershom) Scholem, a fellow student at Berlin. This relationship would\nhave a lifelong influence upon Benjamin’s relation to Judaism and\nKabbalism, notably in his interpretations of Kafka in the early 1930s\nand in the messianic interpretation of the Paul Klee painting Angelus Novus in\nhis later theses ‘On the Concept of History’. Scholem would\nprove instrumental in establishing and, in part, shaping the legacy of\nBenjamin’s works after his death (Raz-Krakotzkin 2013).  \nBenjamin’s doctoral dissertation, ‘The Concept of Art Criticism\nin German Romanticism’, was awarded, summa cum laude, by\nthe University of Bern, Switzerland, in 1919. His celebrated essay on\nGoethe’s novella, The Elective Affinities, was begun shortly\nafter and put into practice the theory of art criticism developed in\nhis dissertation. Benjamin’s Habilitationsschrift on\nthe Origin of the German Mourning-Play (Ursprung des\ndeutschen Trauerspiels)—the thesis which would have enabled\nhim to become a professional academic—had, he feared, with the\ndeath of his intellectual ally, the Protestant theologian Florens\nChristian Rang, lost its “proper reader” (GB 3:16). In 1925, he was forced to withdraw his submission from the\nUniversity of Frankfurt am Main and with it the possibility of a\nfuture academic position. However, despite this academic\nfailure, an excerpt from the work appeared in a literary journal two\nyears later and the book was published the following year (1928),\nquickly receiving favourable attention in a number of well regarded\nnewspapers and periodicals in Germany and further afield (Brodersen\n1996, 154). In an ironic twist, Benjamin’s\nfailed Habilitation study became the subject of a seminar\ncourse taught at Frankfurt University in 1932–3 by Theodor\nWiesengrund (later Theodor W. Adorno). \nMuch of the writing for his thesis was completed in 1924 on the Italian\nisland of Capri, where Benjamin had retreated for financial reasons.\nThe stay would prove decisive, however, since it was here he met the\nBolshevik Latvian theatre producer Asja Lacis, with whom he begun an\nerotically frustrated but intellectually productive relationship.\n‘Naples’ was jointly written with Lacis in 1925, whilst One-Way Street,\na quasi-constructivist collection of fragments written between\n1923–1926 and dedicated to Lacis on its publication in 1928, and the\nunfinished Arcades Project,\nbegun in the late 1920s, both exhibit a modernist experimentation with\nform that can in part be attributed to Lacis’ influence. His\nMarxist turn towards historical materialism was compounded by his\nenthusiastic study of Georg Lukács’ History and Class Consciousness\nwhilst on Capri and a visit to Lacis in Soviet Moscow in the winter of\n1926–7. By the early 1930s Benjamin was closely involved in the plans\nfor a left-wing periodical to be entitled ‘Crisis and\nCritique’, in collaboration with Ernst Bloch, Sigfried Kracauer\nand, among others, the Marxist poet, playwright and theatre director\nBertolt Brecht (Wizisla 2009, 66–98). Benjamin had been introduced\nto Brecht by Lacis in 1929 and over the following decade developed a\nclose personal friendship, in which their literary and political\naffinities had been cemented under the difficult conditions of\npolitical exile. Benjamin undertook a series of studies of\nBrecht’s “epic theatre” and modelled the radio\nbroadcasts he wrote and presented during this period upon the\nlatter’s experiments in theatrical didacticism (Brodersen\n1996, 193). In 1933, Benjamin departed Nazi Germany for the last time,\nfollowing Adorno, Brecht and many other Jewish friends into an exile he\ndivided between Paris, Ibiza, San Remo and Brecht’s house near\nSvendborg, Denmark. \n\nDuring the 1930s the Institute for Social Research, by this point\nunder the directorship of Horkheimer and exiled from its base in the\nUniversity of Frankfurt, provided Benjamin with important\nopportunities for publishing as well as an increasingly necessary\nfinancial stipend.  Theodor W. Adorno, who had been introduced to\nBenjamin a decade earlier by a mutual friend, Siegfried Kracauer, was\ninstrumental in securing this support. An important consequence of\nthis dependence, however, was the editorial revisions to which key\nessays in which Benjamin developed his materialist theory of art were\nsubjected, such as ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical\nReproducibility’ and those on Baudelaire and Paris that grew out\nof The Arcades Project. With the outbreak of war in 1939, Benjamin was temporarily interned\nin the French “concentration camps” established for German\ncitizens. On his release a few months later he returned to Paris and\nthere continued his work in the Bibliothèque Nationale\non The Arcades Project.  The notes for his unfinished\nresearch were left in the safekeeping of librarian and friend, the\nwriter Georges Bataille, as Benjamin fled Paris before the advancing\nGerman army in the summer of 1940. The last few months of Benjamin’s\nlife reflect the precarious experience of countless other Jewish\nGermans in Vichy France: a flight to the border and preparations for\nemigration by legal or illegal means. Lacking the necessary exit visa\nfrom France, he joined a guided party that crossed the Pyrenees in an\nattempt to enter Spain as illegal refugees. Turned back by customs\nofficials, Benjamin took his life in the small, Spanish border town of\nPort Bou, on September 27, 1940.\n \n\nThe importance of Benjamin’s early unpublished fragments for an\nunderstanding his wider philosophical project has been emphasised by a\nnumber of scholars (Wolfharth 1992; Caygill 1998; Rrenban 2005).\nIndeed, without them it becomes difficult to understand the\nintellectual context and historical tradition out of which Benjamin is\nwriting and therefore nearly impossible to grasp the philosophical\nunderpinnings of his works. Of Benjamin’s earliest published\nwriting his attempt in the essay entitled ‘Experience’\n(‘Erfahrung’, 1913/1914) to distinguish an\nalternative and superior concept of experience provides a useful\nintroduction to a central and enduring preoccupation of his\nthought. Benjamin’s concern with delineating an immediate and\nmetaphysical experience of spirit is valuable in providing a thematic\ndescription of a conceptual opposition working throughout his\nthought. Filtered here through the cultural ideals of the Youth\nMovement, this contrasts the empty, spiritless [Geistlosen]\nand unartistic “experiences” accumulated over a life\nmerely lived-through [erlebt] with that privileged kind of\nexperience which is filled with spiritual content through its enduring\ncontact with the dreams of youth (SW 1, 3–6). The influence of\nNietzsche in these earlier texts is discernible (McFarland 2013),\nparticularly, in the importance the young Benjamin places upon\naesthetic experience in overcoming the embittered nihilism of\ncontemporary values (although he is unable to articulate this cultural\ntransformation here beyond a vague appeal to the canon of German\npoets: Schiller, Goethe, Hölderlin, and Stefan Georg). By 1918 the attempt at a more systematic and philosophically\nsophisticated understanding of a “higher concept of\nexperience” (SW 1, 102) within what Benjamin now calls “the\ncoming philosophy” is articulated in relation to Kant’s\ntranscendental idealism. Benjamin argues that the value of Platonic and\nKantian philosophy lies in its attempt to secure the scope and depth of\nknowledge through justification, exemplified in the way Kant conducts a\ncritical inquiry into the transcendental conditions of knowledge. But\nthis Kantian attempt to grasp a certain and timeless knowledge is in\nturn based upon an empirical concept of experience which is restricted,\nBenjamin argues, to that “naked, primitive, self evident”\nexperience of the Enlightenment, whose paradigm is Newtonian physics\n(SW 1, 101). Despite Kant’s introduction of a transcendental\nsubject, his system remains tied to a naïve empiricist\nunderstanding of experience, of the kind privileged in the positivist\nscientific tradition as the encounter between a distinct subject\n(conceived as a cognizing consciousness receiving sensible intuitions)\nand object (understood as a sensation-causing thing-in-itself). In contrast, the pre-Enlightenment concept of experience invested\nthe world with a deeper and more profound significance, because the\nCreation assumes a revelatory religious importance. This is apparent\nnot only in the deeply Christian world-view of mediaeval Europe, but\nsurvives in secularized form in Renaissance and Baroque humanism, and\nin “Counter-Enlightenment” thinkers such as J. G. Hamann,\nGoethe, and the Romantics. Benjamin suggests that the “great\ntransformation and correction which must be performed upon the concept\nof experience, oriented so one-sidedly along mathematical-mechanical\nlines, can be attained only by relating knowledge to language, as was\nattempted by Hamann during Kant’s lifetime” (SW 1, 107–8).\nIn the essay ‘On Language as Such and the Language of Man’\n(‘Über Sprache überhaupt und über die Sprache\ndes Menschen’, c. 1916), Benjamin offers a theological\nconception of language which draws on Hamann’s discussion of Creation\nas the physical imprint of the divine Word of God, to claim that there\n“is no event or thing in either animate or inanimate nature that\ndoes not in some way partake of language” (SW 1,\n62–3). This implies that all experience—including\nperception—is essentially linguistic, whilst all human language\n(including writing, typically associated with mere convention) is\ninherently expressive and creative.  Language is privileged as a model\nof experience in these early essays precisely because it undermines\nand transgresses the neat divisions and limitations operating in the\nKantian system, including that fundamental one that distinguishes\nbetween the subject and object of sensations. If both are\nconstitutively linguistic, language serves as a medium of experience\nthat binds the ostensible “subject” and\n“object” in a more profound, perhaps mystical,\nrelationship of underlying kinship. More generally, Hamann’s\nmetacritique provides Benjamin with a sense of the hypocrisy of the\nKantian separation of understanding and sensibility on the basis of an\nempty and purely formal notion of pure reason, which can itself only\nbe postulated according to the concrete, aesthetic content of\nlanguage. \nWhilst Benjamin is not interested in returning to the pre-critical\nproject of a rationalist deduction of experience, nor to a directly\nreligious conception of the world, he is interested in how the\nscientific concept of experience that Kant is utilising distorts the\nstructure of Kant’s philosophical system, and how this might be\ncorrected with the use of theological concepts. Epistemology must\naddress not only “the question of the certainty of knowledge that\nis lasting”, but also the neglected question of “the\nintegrity of an experience that is ephemeral” (SW 1, 100).\nBenjamin’s suggestion as to how this project might be formulated\nwithin the Kantian system is sketchy, but nonetheless indicates some of\nthe preoccupying concerns of his later writings. In general, it\ninvolves the expansion of the limited spatio-temporal forms and\nessentially causal-mechanistic categories of Kant’s philosophy\nthrough the integration of, for example, religious, historical,\nartistic, linguistic and psychological experiences. Benjamin’s\nenduring concern with the new, the outmoded and the heteronomous\nreflect this attempt to integrate more speculative phenomenological\npossibilities of experience into the remit of philosophical\nknowledge. It resists privileging any single discipline of knowledge,\npreserving a multiplicity that implicates truth in the problem of\naesthetic representation. This would lead Benjamin to attempt a radical\nrethinking of the philosophical concept of the Idea, away from its\ndualistic associations with a timeless and purely rational essence of\nthings. Benjamin also believes that a more speculative metaphysics would\nnecessitate the abolishment of the sharp distinction between Nature\nand Freedom—or causal mechanism and moral willing—in\nKant’s architectonic. Since it is a specific understanding of\n“dialectic” which mediates between these two spheres in\nKant’s critical system, this entails a speculative rethinking of the\nKantian dialectic. This suggests that new possibilities of syllogistic\nlogical relations might themselves be opened up, including what he\ncalls “a certain nonsynthesis of two concepts in another”\n(SW 1, 106; cf. Weber 2008, 48). The relation of nonsynthesis hinted\nat here can be seen to inform Benjamin’s understanding of the Idea as\na constellation of extremes in the Origin of the German\nMourning-Play and of the dialectical image in his mature\nwritings. In this sense, Benjamin’s metacritique of Kant represents an\nattempt to construct an alternative post-Kantian tradition to that of\nHegelian dialectics. It therefore required a new philosophy of\nhistory. Benjamin initially sought to develop these ideas in the context of\nKant’s philosophy of history, believing it was in this context that\nthe problems of the Kantian system could be fully exposed and\nchallenged (C, 98). A very early article, ‘The Life of\nStudents’ (‘Das Leben der Studenten’,\n1915), is useful for suggesting how these problems manifest themselves\nwithin the philosophy of history. It rejects a “a view of\nhistory that puts its faith in the infinite extent of time and thus\nconcerns itself only with the speed, or lack of it, with which people\nand epochs advance along the path of progress” and contrasts\nthis with a perspective “in which history appears to be\nconcentrated on a single focal point, like those that had\ntraditionally been found in the utopian images of the\nphilosophers” (SW 1, 37).  The latter, ‘messianic’\nview of history has a distinct intention and methodology: it aims to\ngrasp how elements of what Benjamin calls “the ultimate\ncondition” and “highest metaphysical state” of\nhistory—which we might call the historical Absolute—appear\nnot as the telos or end of history, but as an immanent state\nof perfection which has the potential to manifest itself in any\nparticular moment (SW 1, 37). He claims that the necessary recognition\nof such metaphysical condition requires an act of criticism\n[Kritik] (SW 1, 38). Benjamin had initially proposed Kant’s\nphilosophy of history as the topic of his doctoral dissertation, and\nwhile he felt it necessary to change this to the Early German\nRomantics’ philosophy of art, crucial features of the proposed project\nsurvive in the final work. Astute readers, he says, may still discern\nin it an “insight into the relationship of a truth to\nhistory” (C, 135–6). Specifically, the concept of art\ncriticism operating in Romantic aesthetics rests upon epistemological\npresuppositions that reveal the ‘messianic’ essence of\nRomanticism (SW 1, 116–7; n.3, 185). The messianic conjunction\nbetween the highest metaphysical state of history and the ephemerality\nof each particular moment is here seen as theoretically determining\nthe Romantic relationship between the artistic Absolute—or what\nBenjamin defines as the Idea of art—and each particular\nartwork. In his doctoral dissertation, Benjamin argues that the philosophical\nrelationship between the Idea of art and particular artworks posited in\nRomantic aesthetics must be understood in relation to Fichte’s\ntheory of reflection. This sought to ground the possibility of a\ncertain and immediate type of cognition without recourse to the\nproblematic notion of an intellectual intuition. For Fichte, reflection\nindicates the free activity of consciousness taking itself as its own\nobject of thought: its capacity for thinking of thinking. In doing so,\nthe initial form of thinking is transformed into its content. In such\nreflection, thought seems capable of immediately grasping itself as a\nthinking subject and therefore of possessing a certain kind of\nimmediate and foundational knowledge. Although Benjamin introduces a\nnumber of specific criticisms of Fichte’s philosophical position\nin his dissertation, he nonetheless values the Fichtean concept of\nreflection for providing the epistemological foundation of Friedrich\nSchlegel’s and Novalis’ understandings of the metaphysical\nfunction of art criticism. Some scholars have, however, questioned the\naccuracy of Benjamin’s interpretation of Fichte’s concept\nof reflection and the importance he accords to it in Romantic\nepistemology (Bullock 1987, 78–93; Menninghaus 2005, 29–44).  Unlike in Fichte, here immediacy and infinitude are not mutually\nexclusive aspects of cognition. The uniqueness of the Romantic concept\nof the Absolute resides in the fact that the Romantic conception of\ninfinitude regards it not as empty but “substantial and\nfilled” (SW 1, 129). Benjamin argued that the Romantics\nspecifically identified this structure of the Absolute with the Idea of\nart, and in particular with artistic form (SW 1, 135). Art criticism\nbecomes central to this concept of infinite fulfilment because, like\nthe epistemological relation between reflection and thought in Fichte,\ncriticism both consummates the finite and particular work by raising it\nto a higher level—in which the form of the work is transformed\ninto content as the object of criticism—and simultaneously\nconnects the work’s particular artistic form with the continuity\nand unity of absolute form in the Idea of art. Criticism is, for the\nRomantics, the continuation and ongoing completion of the particular\nwork through its infinite connection with other art works and works of\ncriticism. By conceiving the Idea of art as a ‘medium of\nreflection’, the early Romantics dissolve the Enlightenment\nworld-view of the positive sciences that Fichte inherited from Kant,\nand in doing so overcome the critical injunctions placed upon the\nexperience of the infinite (SW 1, 132; 131). This conception of a\nfulfilled infinity constitutes the messianism that Benjamin claims is\nessential to Early Romantic epistemology. In the version of the dissertation formally submitted to the\nuniversity, Benjamin concludes by identifying the Romantic theory of\nart criticism with ‘the consummation of the work’ (SW 1,\n177). The artwork provides the immanent criterion for critical\nreflection, which in turn completes the work by raising it into an\nautonomous and higher existence. This immanent criticism rejects both\nthe dogmatic imposition of external rules (such as those of classical\naesthetics) and the dissolution of aesthetic criteria (with the appeal\nto artistic genius). It provides, Benjamin thought, one of the\nfundamental legacies for a modern concept of art criticism. The version\ncirculated amongst friends and colleagues does not conclude with a\ncomplete affirmation of Romanticism, however, but contains a critical\nafterword that renders explicit the critical objections that Benjamin\nhad carefully inserted into the text. These suggest that the Romantic\ntheory of art, and by implication the structure of the Absolute it is\ngrounded upon, is problematically one-sided and incomplete with regard\nto (1) its formalism, (2) its positivity, and (3) its singularity.  Since the content of each, successive,\nlevel of reflection is supplied by the form of its object, the\ncriticism unfolds the germ of immanent criticizability contained in\neach particular artwork’s form. This formalism precludes any\nserious discussion of the artwork’s specific content. Conversely, anything immanently uncriticizable cannot constitute a\ntrue work of art. As a consequence, Romantic criticism is unable to\ndifferentiate between good or bad artworks, since its only criterion\nis whether a work is or is not art. Such criticism\nis entirely positive in its evaluation, and lacks the important\nnegative moment essential to judgement. Finally, Schlegel “committed the old error of confounding\n‘abstract and ‘universal’ when he believed he had to\nmake that [Absolute] ground [of art] into an individual”,\nBenjamin claims (SW 1, 166–7). He therefore gave a “false\ninterpretation” of the unity of all works when he conceived this\nas pertaining to some mystical, singular and transcendental work. The consequent need for what Benjamin presents as a Goethean\nmodification of Early German Romanticism is laid out in the afterword.\nThe relation between these criticisms of Romanticism and Goethe’s\nthought is suggested in the claim that, “Ultimately the mystical\nthesis that art itself is one work…stands in exact correlation with\nthe principle which asserts the indestructibility of works that are\npurified in irony” (SW 1, 167). With its mistaken emphasis on the\nsingularity of the Idea of art, Romantic fulfilment only coincides with\nthe infinity of the unconditioned, meaning that fulfilment is an\nessentially non-historical category of the infinite. Such criticism\ncannot be described as judgement, since all authentic judgement\ninvolves an essential negative moment of completion in\n“self-annihilation” (SW 1, 152). Consequently, because\n‘Romantic messianism is not at work in its full force’ here\n(SW 1, 168), the Romantics were increasingly forced to turn to the\n“accoutrements” of ethics, religion and politics to provide\nthe content required to complete their theory of art.  Goethe’s conception of aesthetic judgement and his principle\nof the ‘uncriticizability’ of great works provided Benjamin\nwith a way of thinking the necessary modification to the Early German\nRomantic Idea of art. His explication of the implicit metaphysical\nstructure of Goethe’s corresponding Ideal of art reveals the\ncontrasting features of his structure of the Absolute: as a sphere of\npure content, a medium of destructive refraction,\nand a plurality of discontinuous archetypes (Charles 2020, 53–67). Because finite, particular\nworks can never be romanticized into the unity of an individual\nAbsolute, they remains immanently incomplete and yet nonetheless\nincapable of higher consummation: a “torso”, dismembered in\nrelation to the whole, corpse-like in its deadness. In this context,\nthe true task of criticism becomes not the consummation of the living\nwork, but that destructive completion of the dying one. Benjamin’s essay on ‘Goethe’s Elective\nAffinities’ (1924–5) provides an exemplary piece of\nsuch criticism, whilst developing the concept further by situating it\nmore explicitly within the context of history. Here, criticism is\ncharged with the task of revealing what Benjamin calls the\n“truth content of a work of art”, which is intimately\nbound up with its “material content” at the beginning of\nthe work’s history (SW 1, 297). In contrast to mere\ncommentary—which proceeds no further than a consideration of\nthese now historically anachronistic features of its material\ncontent—the aim of criticism is the destruction of this outer\nlayer in order for the work’s inner truth content to be grasped. The\nfundamental philological error of commentary is merely to situate the\nwork in relation to the “lived experience\n[Erlebnis]” of its author’s biographical life\n(exemplified in Friedrich Gundolf’s 1916 biography\nof Goethe), instead of the broader medium of historical\nreception through which it has passed down to the contemporary\ncritic. Benjamin’s Romantic theory of immanent criticism insists that\nthe work must contain its own inner criterion, such that the critic\nproceeds from the work itself and not from the life of the author (SW\n1, 321). Beginning, therefore, with the odd and striking features of\nGoethe’s work that come to preoccupy later critics, Benjamin examines\nhow these are derived from techniques borrowed from the distinct form\nof the novella. This novella-like construction grants the Elective\nAffinities its strange, fable-like quality, which differentiates\nit from the naturalism of a typical novel. It is this mythical layer,\nas the real material content of the work, which expresses the presence\nof a pantheistic and “daemonic” attitude toward nature in\nGoethe’s work. Truth content, in contrast, is not to be sought in the conspicuous\nfeatures of the work’s technique, but in the unity of its\ndistinct form. The task of criticism is to make this truth content an\nobject of experience. It concerns itself not with the life or\nintentions of the artist, but with that semblance or appearance of life\nthat the work itself possesses by virtue of its mimetic capacity for\nrepresentation: its linguistic expressiveness, which is described as a\nverging and bordering on life (SW 1, 350). What is essential to art,\nhowever, and what distinguishes it from the semblance of nature, is the\n“expressionless [Ausdruckslose]”:\nthat critical violence within the work of art that “arrests this\nsemblance, spellbinds the movement, and interrupts the harmony”\n(SW 1, 340). “Only the expressionless completes the work” as\na work of art, Benjamin argues, and it does so by shattering the\nwork’s semblance of unity, the false appearance of totality\npertaining to it. Unlike the intensification of Romantic reflection,\nwhen this semblance itself becomes the object of a higher-level\nsemblance, a refractive dissonance is opened up. Drawing on\nHölderlin’s concept of the caesura to describe this moment,\nBenjamin calls it a “counter-rhythmic rupture” (SW 1, 341).\nIn focusing its efforts on representing this caesura, genuine criticism\nin turn deepens the refractive violence, performing a destructive or\nmortuary act of self-annihilation upon the work. Art, at the very limit of its mimetic capacity, draws attention to\nits construction and in doing so finds the resources to encapsulate a\ndeeper truth. It is against what Benjamin calls the Christian-mystical\ncertainty in future reconciliation (which Goethe inserts into the\nconclusion of the novella as an attempt to counter the mythical\nfatalism which holds sway elsewhere) that he instead endorses the\nparadoxical glimmer of hope identified with the image of a shooting\nstar which appears in Goethe’s novella (SW 1, 354–5). If the\nimage of the star retains its relationship to the symbolic here, it\ndoes so in accordance with Benjamin’s earlier description of the\nexpressionless as “the torso of a symbol” (SW 1, 340).\nHowever, it might be better to understand the significance of the\ncaesura here in the context of the theory of allegory. This is only\nproperly formulated in Benjamin’s next major work, his thesis on\nthe Origin of the German Mourning-Play (Ursprung des\ndeutschen Trauerspiels, 1928). \n ‘Mourning-play’ (Trauerspiel)\nis a term used to characterise a type of drama that emerges during the\nbaroque period of art history in the late 16th and early 17th century.\nThe principle examples discussed in Benjamin’s thesis come not\nfrom its great exponents, Pedro Calderón de la Barca and William\nShakespeare, but the German dramatists Martin Opitz, Andreas Gryphius,\nJohann Christian Hallmann, Daniel Caspar von Lohenstein, and August\nAdolf von Haugwitz. Their plays are characterised by a simplicity of\naction which is comparable to the classicism of earlier Renaissance\ntheatre, but also contain peculiarly baroque features. These include an\nexaggerated and violent bombast in their language (including a\nfigurative tendency towards linguistic contraction), an absence of\npsychological depth in its characters, a preponderance of and\ndependency upon theatrical props and machinery, and a crude emphasis on\nviolence, suffering and death (cf. Newman 2011; Ferber 2013). Leaving aside for now the methodological introduction (referred to\nin English as the ‘Epistemo-Critical Prologue’), the first\npart of Benjamin’s thesis is concerned with repudiating the dogmatic\nattempt by later critics to impose onto these plays the external\ncriteria of Aristotelian aesthetics, which are rooted in classical\ntragedy. Benjamin’s understanding of tragedy here (and his approach to\nthe mourning-play in general) is partially influenced by Friedrich\nNietzsche’s The Birth of Tragedy. Benjamin claims\nthat The Birth of Tragedy substantiates the critical insight\nthat the empathy of undirected modern feeling is unhelpful for properly\ngrasping ancient tragedy (OGT, 93).  Instead, Nietzsche undertook a\nmetaphysical inquiry into the essence of tragedy as a dialectical\ninterplay of the contrasting aesthetic impulses of Apollonian\nsemblance and Dionysian truth. This dialectic is central to Benjamin’s\nown philosophical investigations, particularly his claim—derived\nfrom his discussion of Goethe’s Elective\nAffinities—that an expressionless moment is constitutive of\nart, in which the limits of semblance are broached precisely in order\nto illuminate an artistic truth. But Benjamin is also critical of Nietzsche for restricting his\napproach to aesthetics, and therefore renouncing the understanding of\ntragedy in historical terms. Lacking a philosophy of history,\nNietzsche’s study was unable to situate the political and ethical\nsignificance of the metaphysical and mythical features it isolates\n(OGT, 93). Influenced by ideas from Franz Rosenzweig and Florens\nChristian Rang (Asman 1992), Benjamin presents tragedy as\nexpressing a perceived break between the prehistorical age of mythical\ngods and heroes and the emergence of a new ethical and political\ncommunity. The historical limitations of Nietzsche’s theory of\ntragedy become acute when it comes to the question of the possibility\nof a recuperation of the tragic form in modern theatre. Whilst\nNietzsche tends to simply denounce the weakness of modern drama against\nthe strength of the Greeks (excepting, in his early work, the operas of\nWagner), Benjamin is concerned with establishing whether the historical\nconditions of the tragic form are themselves a limit to its\ncontemporary efficacy.  In line with the principles of Romantic criticism discussed above,\nmourning-plays contain their own distinct form and should be criticised\naccording to their own immanently discovered standards. The\n“content [Gehalt]” and “\ntrue object” of the baroque mourning-play is not, as it is in\ntragedy, myth but rather historical life (OGT, 46). As with\nGoethe’s borrowing of the novella form, this content is in part\nderived from other aesthetic structures, principally the eschatological\nfocus of mediaeval Christian literature: the Passion-Plays,\nMystery-Plays and chronicles whose historiography portrayed “the\nwhole of the course of history, world history as salvation history” (OGT,\n65). But the Lutheran renunciation of the Catholic emphasis upon good\nworks, and the secularizing tendency implicit in the naturalistic legal\nand political philosophies of the 16th and 17th century (discussed in\nrelation to Carl Schmitt’s theory of sovereignty) resulted in the\nstripping bare of human value and significance from such history. This\ntense, antinomical combination of transcendence and immanence produces\nan uneasy hybrid, in which history—as a narrative of the human\nmarch towards redemption on the Day of Judgement—loses the\neschatological certainty of its redemptive conclusion, and becomes\nsecularized into a mere natural setting for the profane struggle over\npolitical power.  Benjamin’s reflections on sovereign violence in the 17th century\nmay be contrasted with his discussion of the revolutionary kind in his\nearlier ‘Critique of Violence’ (‘Zur Kritik der\nGewalt’, 1921), itself a response to Georges\nSorel’s Reflections on Violence (1908).  These texts have\nprovoked a number of responses in the context of political theology,\nmost notably from Carl Schmitt, Jacques Derrida and Giorgio\nAgamben. Schmitt responded directly to Benjamin’s essay in Hamlet\nor Hecuba (1956). Derrida’s section on the ‘Critique of\nViolence’ in his Force of Law: The Mystical Foundation of\nAuthority (1989) interrogates this evocation of a revolutionary\nkind of divine violence, a critical engagement which continues in\nDerrida’s discussion of the messianic in Spectres of Marx\n(1994) and ‘Marx and Sons’ (1999), and in relation to\nSchmitt in The Politics of Friendship (1994). These complex\nrelations between Benjamin, Schmitt, and Derrida have become the\nsubject of a number of studies, including Agamben’s State\nof Exception (2004) (Bredekamp 1999, 247–266; Liska 2009),\nalthough more careful studies have emphasized the clear divergences\nbetween Benjamin’s position and those of Derrida and of Schmitt (Tomba\n2009, 131–132; Averlar 2005, 79–106; Weber 2008,\n176–194). In this respect, it was not Schmitt’s political\ntheology but the reactionary vitalism of Ludwig Klages that proved a\nmore influential and enduring object of fascination for Benjamin (Fuld\n1981; McCole 1993, 178–180, 236–246; Wolin 1994,\nxxxi–xxxviii; Wohlfarth 2002, 65–109; Lebovic 2013,\n1–10, 79–110; Charles 2018, 52–62).  In the second part of his thesis, Benjamin employs the concept of\nallegory to expose the implicit eschatological structure of these\nworks. However, the first part utilises the distorting tension of this\nstructure to distinguish the specific and historically conspicuous\ntechnique of the German baroque mourning-play. This concludes by\nidentifying sorrow or mourning (Trauer)\nas the predominant mood inherent to its metaphysical structure, in\ncontrast to the suffering of tragedy. With the “total \nsecularization of the historical in the state of creation…History\npasses into the setting” to become natural history (OGT, 81),\nwhose attendant cognition is a melancholic contemplation of things\nwhich derives enigmatic satisfaction from its very recognition of their\ntransience and emptiness (OGT, 141). “For all wisdom of the\nmelancholic hearkens to the deep”, Benjamin claims:\n“it is won from immersion in the life of creaturely things, and\nnothing of the voice of revelation reaches it. Everything to do with Saturn\npoints into the depths of the earth…” (OGT, 157). To grasp how the form of these works are determined by their truth\ncontent requires a reconstruction of the baroque concept of the\nallegorical which structures its mood of melancholic contemplativeness.\nBenjamin’s claim is that a genuine understanding of the\nallegorical as it emerged in its highest form in the 17th century has\nbeen obscured by, on the one hand, the later Romantic aestheticizing of\nthe symbol and, on the other, by the tendency to conceive the\nallegorical negatively in its contrast with this devalued, aesthetic\nconcept. It is only by first recovering a genuine theological concept\nof the symbol, therefore, that we are able in turn to distinguish an\nauthentic concept of the allegorical. This it to be done by reasserting\nthe profound but paradoxical theological unity between the material and\nthe transcendental found in the symbolic. The fundamental distinction\nbetween theological concepts of symbol and the allegory will then be\nseen as concerning not their differing objects (Idea vs. abstract\nconcept), but the differing ways in which they signify, express or\nrepresent this object. Benjamin will conclude that this difference is,\nspecifically, a temporal one.  Drawing on undeveloped insights found in the work of the\nmythographers Georg Friedrich Creuzer and Johann Joseph von\nGörres, Benjamin points out how “the temporal measure for the experience of the symbol[Symbolerfahrung] is the mystical instant\n[Nu]” (OGT, 173). We must understand the temporality of\nthe allegorical, in contrast, as something dynamic, mobile, and\nfluid. This authentic concept of allegory arises in the 17th century\nbaroque as a response to the antithesis between mediaeval religiosity\nand Renaissance secularization discussed earlier. The spatialization\nof the temporal structure of eschatology in the allegorical\ncorresponds to the naturalization of the religious structure of\nhistory in the baroque: “Whereas in the symbol, with the\nsublimation of downfall, the transfigured countenance of nature reveals itself \nfleetingly in the light of salvation, in allegory\nthere lies before the eyes of the observer the facies hippocratica [lit. ‘Hippocratic face’\n= the sunken, hollow and pinched features exhibited by the dying] of history\nas petrified primal\nlandscape. History, in everything untimely, sorrowful, and miscarried that belongs to it from the beginning, is inscribed in a\nface—no, in a death’s head [Totenkopfe]”\n(OGT, 174). From the perspective of the allegorical, the instantaneous\ntransformation within the symbolic becomes a natural history slowed to\nsuch an extreme that every sign appears frozen and—seemingly\nloosened from every other relationship—arbitrary. The concrete\ncorporeality of the written script exemplifies this allegorical\nemphasis upon things. Allegory is not the conventional\nrepresentation of some expression, as misunderstood by later critics,\nbut an expression of convention [Ausdruck der\nKonvention] (OGT, 185). Allegorical expression includes as its\nobject this very conventionality of the historical, this appearance of\ninsignificance and indifference. That is, convention itself comes to\nbe signified or expressed. What Benjamin rediscovers in the\nallegorical is, then, something akin to the concept of the\nexpressionless, as the torso of a symbol, introduced in the essay on\nGoethe. Benjamin argues that this predominance of the allegorical\nviewpoint in the 17th century baroque finds it most dramatic\nexpression in the mourning-play, and that consequently the Idea of the\nmourning-play must be grasped via the allegorical.  The Erkenntniskritische Vorrede\nor ‘Epistemo-Critical Prologue’ to the work may be\nunderstood as having  two central functions: it provides a direct\nmethodological justification for the theory of criticism being utilised\nin the work, by way of a problematization of existing disciplinary\napproaches, and it implicitly recovers a concept of allegorical\nexperience which is delineated  in the second part of the thesis\nin terms amenable for modernity. At the level of methodology, Benjamin\nadvocates the necessity of a transdisciplinary approach (Osborne 2011, 24) to artworks,\ncapable of critically overcoming the epistemological and historical\nlimitations of the existing disciplines of the philosophy of art and\nthe history of art (specifically, literary history). This\ntransdisciplinary aspect of Benjamin’s thesis may partially\naccount for the difficulties in its reception at the University of\nFrankfurt, where the thesis was rejected by the departments of both\nphilosophy and literature. Much of the theoretical discussion in the\nPrologue is concerned with correcting the methodological one-sidedness\nof each existing approach by way of the positive features of the other.\nIn general, the philosophy of art correctly attends to the problem of\nessences, but remains hampered by its lack of any adequate historical\nconsideration. Conversely, the history of art is preoccupied with\nhistorical lineage but has no adequate concept of essence. Yet it is\nnot simply an amalgamation of aesthetics and history that is required,\nbut their radical rethinking in accordance with first a historical\nconcept of essence and second a philosophical concept of history.   Broadly speaking, Benjamin’s theory of Ideas transposes the\nphilosophical problem of metaphysical realism into the context of\naesthetics. That is, it asks about the reality of aesthetic genres such\nas ‘tragedy’ or of artistic epochs such as the\n‘Renaissance’ that classify a group of particular works\naccording to a set of common characteristics. The Prologue criticises\nexisting traditions of aesthetic nominalism for their inadequate\nresolution of the problem. The uncritical use of inductive methods\ndemonstrated by literary historians rejects the hypostatization of\nterms such as “Renaissance” on the grounds that it promotes\na false identity between similar empirical features, which obscures\ntheir diversity. This aversion to any realism of constitutive Ideas is\ngrounded on the positivist criterion of factual verification. A term\nlike the “Renaissance” is consequently utilised by them\nonly on the proviso that it is understood as merely an abstract general\nconcept. This quickly leads to scepticism, however, since its still\nfails to address the problematic criteria by which this general concept\nis initially picked out and abstracted from the multiplicity of\nparticulars or on what grounds these particulars are grouped together.\nConsequently, it fails to appreciate the necessity of the Platonic\npostulation of Ideas for the representation of essences: whilst\nconcepts seek to make the similar identical, Ideas are necessary to\neffect a dialectical synthesis between phenomenal extremes (OGT, 18–19).\nIn contrast, philosophers of art possess a concern with the essential\nthat ends up renouncing any notion of generic forms, on the grounds\nthat the singular originality of every single work entails the only\npossible essential genre must be the universal and individual one of\nart itself. The error—as Benjamin had previously charged the\nEarly German Romantics, discussed above—is to dissolve real and\nimportant aesthetic structures or forms into an undifferentiated unity\n(of art), which denies their irreducible multiplicity (OGT, 21–23).\n The theory of Ideas presented in the Prologue is truncated and\ndifficult to understand outside the context of Benjamin’s earlier\nworks, and the philosophical tradition that it engages with is further\nobscured in the first English translation. However, the critical aspects of\nBenjamin’s investigation advocate—against aesthetic\nversions of positivist empiricism—a metaphysical realism, and,\nagainst certain versions of philosophical idealism, a non-singular\nessentialism. That is, he does not restrict the possibility of\nmetaphysical reality only to actual empirical particulars and he\nadvocates the multiplicity and not singularity of the essence\n(understood, in Goethean terms, as a harmony and not a unity of truth).\nIn doing so, he must address that  ‘theological’\nparadox, mentioned in the discussion of symbol and allegory, of how the\ntranscendental/supersensuous appears immanently within the\nmaterial/sensuous. Benjamin is clear that the relation between Ideas\nand phenomenon is neither one of Aristotelian ‘containment’\nnor one of Kantian lawfulness or hypothesis. Ideas are not given to\nsome intellectual intuition, but they are capable of being sensuously\nrepresented. Such a sensuous representation of the truth remains the\ntask of philosophy. Benjamin’s theoretical elaboration proceeds by startling imagistic\nreconfigurations of pre-existing elements within the philosophical\ntradition. He offers a number of possibilities for thinking such Ideas\nin the Prologue, taken from the realm not only of philosophy but of\naesthetics, theology and science. The first is the Platonic Idea, here\ndivorced from its association with the scientific ascent to some\npurely rational, objective knowledge (such as appears in the account\nof dialectic in the Republic) and instead linked to the\ndiscussion of beautiful semblance in the Symposium (OGT,\n6). The second is that of the Adamic Name, as developed in his\nearlier theory of language. In this context, he comments that the\nEarly German Romantics were frustrated in their attempt to renew the\ntheory of Ideas because truth took on the character of reflective\nconsciousness for them, rather than that intentionless, linguistic\ncharacter in which things were subsumed under essential Names by\nAdam’s primal-interrogation [urvernehmen] (OGT, 15). Naming\nis the primal history [Urgeschicte] of signifying, indicating\na thing-like disinterest which contrasts with the directed, unifying\nintentionality of Husserlian phenomenology (OGT, 14). The third is\nthe Goethean Ideal, which is recalled here in the context of the\nFaustian “Mothers” and which implicitly gestures towards\nhis earlier discussions of Goethe (OGT, 11). Finally, and most famously,\nBenjamin compares the virtual objectivity of the Idea represented\nthrough the reconfiguring of actual phenomena to an astrological\nconstellation, which simultaneously groups together and is revealed by\nthe cluster of individual stars (OGT, 11). Truth is said to be “actualized in the round dance of presented Ideas [vergegenwärtigt\nim Reigen der dargestellen Ideen]” (OGT, 4). This concept of the constellation is taken up\ndirectly in Adorno’s inaugural lecture ‘The Actuality of\nPhilosophy’, where he speaks of ‘the manipulation of\nconceptual material by philosophy…of grouping and trial\narrangement, of constellation and construction’ (Adorno 1931,\n131). It comes to inform Benjamin’s philosophical practice in his\nmajor writings from this point onwards, from One-Way Street\n(1928), via the methodological demand for the construction of history\nand the attendant theory of the dialectical image in his work related\nto the “Arcades Project” in the 1930s, through to the\nconcept of history presented in his celebrated late essay, ‘On\nthe Concept of History’ (1940).  Benjamin’s concern to reincorporate the perspective of\nart’s temporal transformation demands an analogous\nradicalization. The “genetic and concrete classification”\n(OGT, 24) that Benedetto Croce called history (in order to distinguish\nit from that generalizing thought that abstracts away from change and\ndevelopment) must now be reconciled with Benjamin’s theory of\nIdeas. For the messianic philosophy of history that grounds\nBenjamin’s work problematizes existing formulations of the\nconcepts of history and historical origin. In line with his discussion\nof the Idea, the concept of historical origin should not be reduced to\nthe causality and actuality of the empirically factual, nor should it\nbe regarded as a purely logical and timeless essence. It is not\nmerely, Benjamin argues, “the coming-to-be of what has originated ” and cannot be recognized in “the naked, manifest existence of the factual” (OGT, 24). For the\n‘historical’ sequence that permits the Idea to be\nrepresented must include not only that of the actual phenomena of a\ngiven period, but also that of their subsequent development in the\nunderstanding of later epochs. An investigation of the essence of the\nGerman mourning-play, for example, cannot restrict itself to\ncontemporaneous events and actual plays as if these were\n‘facts’ settled and decided once and for all, but must\nalso investigate the changing understanding of this historical epoch\nand the varying reception of these plays, including the prior\nconditions of its own self-understanding. But nor is it a\n“purely logical” category, as if the Idea were some\nessence detached from and unrelated to history, to be grasped through\nan abstraction from all these particular historical developments (OGT,\n25). Origin [Ursprung] is therefore distinguished from a\nmerely genetic coming-into-being [Enstehung] and evolutionary\ndevelopment of ‘pure history’, to include the essential\ninner history of the “life of the works and forms” (OGT,\n24–6). The “science of the Origin” is a philosophical\nhistory, a history of the essential, whose contemplation enlists a\ndialectical perspective to grasp the form of the “original\nphenomenon”: as something subject to a process of becoming and\ndisappearing, and therefore only partial and incomplete.  Benjamin\nonce again resorts to an image: “The origin stands as eddy in the\nstream of becoming and vigorously draws the emerging material into its\nrhythm” (OGT, 24). Criticism\nattempts to virtually reassemble the fore- and after-history [Vor-\nund Nachgeschichte] of the phenomena into a historical\nconstellation, in which the Idea is represented and the phenomena\nredeemed. This is its messianic function in relation to the historical\nAbsolute.  The Prologue also seeks to rescue the allegorical experience\nrecognised in the mourning-plays for a modern theory of criticism.\nAllegorical contemplation aims at the ruination of things so that it\ncan, in its redemptive moment, construct [baun]\na new whole out of the elements of the old. The character of this\nconstruction distinguishes it from the creative invention of fantasy,\nsince it manipulates and rearranges pre-existing material. To leave an\nimprint or impression of this construction [Konstruktion]\nis one of its aims. This dual emphasis upon destruction and\nconstruction has led a number of scholars to see an anticipation of\nDerridean deconstruction in Benjamin’s work (Fischer 1996,\nSection 1: Modernity/Postmodernity; Weber 2008, 122–128), although it\nshould be noted that his consideration of the specific historicity of\nthis concept of criticism and his insistence of the immanent truth\ncontent of artworks remains resolutely modernist, and cannot be easily\nassimilated into any ‘postmodernist’ position (cf. Weigel\n1996, xiv). The underlying affinity between romanticism and the baroque\nlies in their shared modernist concern with correcting classicism in\nart and the quasi-mythical perspective of classicism in general (OGT,\n230; 185). The Prologue reflects upon this ‘modernity’ of\nthe baroque when it notes how the “Striking analogies to the current state of German literature have repeatedly given rise to …immersion in the Baroque” (OGT, 36). Although Benjamin is\nciting the similarities between Expressionism in modern literature and\nthe Mannerist exaggeration of the baroque, his own reconstruction of\nallegorical experience and its value for aesthetic theory is\nexperienced according to a historical conjunction between the baroque\npast and the modernity of Benjamin’s present: modernity both\nreveals and is revealed in the baroque.  The book on mourning-plays concluded Benjamin’s German “cycle\nof production” (C, 322). At the beginning of the 1920s\nBenjamin became immersed in what was planned as a large-scale study of\npolitical thought, of which only a few fragments and the ‘Critique of\nViolence’ remain (Steiner 2001, 61). As Uwe Steiner notes, while\nBenjamin’s political thought may be situated in the milieu of\nExpressionist Nietzsche-reception, the centrality that the realization\nof happiness occupies in his definition of politics as “the\nsatisfaction of unenhanced humanness” is constructed in direct\nopposition to Zarathustra’s tragic heroism (Steiner 2001, 49–50,\n61–62). This marks both a continuity with and a break from what Irving\nWohlfarth has called his earlier “politics of Youth” (Wohlfarth 1992,\n164), which drew heavily on a philosophy of history and culture\ninfluenced by Nietzsche’s Untimely Meditations. Benjamin\nremarked that his break from the Youth Movement did not constitute the\nabandonment of this earlier thought, however, but its submergence into\na ‘harder, purer, more invisible radicalism’ (C, 74). This in part\naccounts for what T. J. Clark describes as the “cryptic” character of\n- what Adorno termed (SW 4, 101-2) - the anthropological materialism\nof The Arcades Project, where, Clark comments, it is “as if\nsuch a politics were being actively aired and developed elsewhere”\n(Clark 2003, 45–46). \nA new cycle was initiated with One-Way Street\n(Einbahnstraße), written 1923–6, published 1928),\nwhose form and content puts into practice that speculative concept of\nexperience, with its allegorical immersion into the depths of things,\nwhich was theoretically articulated in the works considered above. The\ncity furnishes the sensuous, imagistic material for One-Way\nStreet, whilst the genres of the leaflet, placard and\nadvertisement provide the constructive principle by which it is\nrearranged as a constellation.  This formal methodology resembles the\ntechnological media of photography and film, as well as the\navant-garde practices of Russian Constructivism and French\nSurrealism. This entails what Adorno describes as a “philosophy\ndirected against philosophy” (Adorno 1955, 235) or what Howard\nCaygill calls a “philosophizing beyond philosophy”\n(Caygill 1989, 119). The presentation of contemporary capitalism as metropolitan\nmodernity in One-Way Street also marks the turning point in\nBenjamin’s writings, away from what he retrospectively called\n“an archaic form of philosophizing naively caught up in\nnature” (BA, 88) towards the development of “a political\nview of the past” (SW 2, 210). The theory of experience outlined\nin his early writings is enlisted for revolutionary ends. In the\nessay, ‘Surrealism: The Last Snapshot of the European\nIntelligentsia’ (1929), Surrealist experience provides an\nexample of a “profane illumination”, which in contrast to\nthe sacred and moralistic kind found in religion was guided by a\npolitical and a “materialistic, anthropological\ninspiration” (SW 2, 209). The latent energy residing in the most\ndestitute and outmoded of things is, through the construction of new\npolitical constellations, transformed into an intoxicating,\nrevolutionary experience (SW 2, 210). The possibility of such a\nprofane illumination of nineteenth century Paris, to be presented as\nthe origin of modernity, preoccupied the remaining decade of\nBenjamin’s life, and his research for the monumental and unfinished\n“Arcades Project” provides the material from which all his\nremaining work is constructed.\n The city was the seedbed of Benjamin’s ‘gothic’ Marxism\n(Cohen 1993); Paris its testing ground. All of Benjamin’s writings\nfrom the autumn of 1927 until his death in 1940 relate in one way or\nother to his great unfinished study ‘Paris—Capital of the\nNineteenth Century’, otherwise known as The Arcades\nProject (Das Passagen-Werk), after its founding image,\ntaken by Benjamin from the 1926 novel, Le Paysan de Paris, by\nthe French surrealist Louis Aragon. This was a book of which Benjamin\nwrote: “I could never read more than two or three pages in bed\nat night before my heart started to beat so strongly that I had to lay\nthe book aside.” (BA, 88) The arcades would become just one of\nfive or six archetypal images of the psychosocial space of\n19th-century Paris around which the project was organized—each\npaired with a particular, thematically representative individual. But\nit provided the model for the others, and its surrealist origin and\nliminal utopian impulse, neither quite inside nor out, established the\nwish-image and the dream-image—on the threshold of sleeping and\nwaking—at the heart of a work that was initially conceived as a\nkind of ‘dialectical fairytale’. (The figure with whom\n‘the arcades’ was paired was the utopian socialist Charles\nFourier.) All of Benjamin’s major essays of the 1930s derived their\nimpetus and orientation from his Arcades work, and served to defer its\ncompletion in the act of elaborating its elements.  This deferral was also, in part, the result of a process of\nmaturation—a kind of ripening—immanent to the work\nitself. The Arcades was a vast and ambitious project, not\nsimply in terms of the mass and breadth of its archival sources\n(sought out by Benjamin in the Bibliothèque Nationale in\nParis), but also—indeed, primarily—with respect to its\nphilosophical and historical intent, and the methodological and\nrepresentational challenges it posed. Its sprawling, yet minutely\ninvestigated historical object was to act as the point of entry into\nthe philosophically comprehended experience of metropolitan\ncapitalism—not some past experience, or the experience of a past\nphase of capitalist development, but the experience of the capitalist\nmetropolis in Benjamin’s own day—through the construction of a\nspecific series of relations between its elements ‘then’\nand ‘now’. The practice of research, conceptual\norganization and presentation that it involved was self-consciously\nconceived as a working model for a new, philosophically oriented,\nmaterialist historiography with political intent. Its final,\nfragmentary and ‘ruined’ status has come to stand not\nsimply as the sign of a failure of completion, but as a paradigm of a\nform of constitutive incompletion that is characteristic of all\nsystematically oriented knowledge under the conditions of\nmodernity. In this respect, in its very failure to be actualized, it\nconfirmed the fundamental historical and philosophical truth of\nBenjamin’s earlier analysis of the Romantic fragment—extending\nthe genre in a hitherto unimagined way. In the ebb and flow of its changing rhythms—additions,\nrevisions, reformulations and retrievals—Benjamin’s Arcades\nProject provides an extraordinary case study in the labour of\nconceptual construction via the configuration and reconfiguration of\narchival materials. The voluminous ‘Notes and Materials’\nthat make up the Arcades as it has come down to us remained\nunpublished until 1982, finally appearing in English only in 1999 (GS\nV; AP). Only since their publication has it been possible to get a\nclear sense of the overall trajectory of Benjamin’s thought during\nthis period—rendering redundant, or at least displacing, many of\nthe polemics associated with previous cycles of reception. The notes\nand materials are organized into twenty-six alphabetically designated\n‘convolutes’ (literally ‘bundles’) or folders,\nthematically defined by various objects (arcades, catacombs,\nbarricades, iron constructions, mirrors, modes of\nlighting…), topics (fashion, boredom, theory of\nknowledge, theory of progress, painting,\nconspiracies…), figures (the collector, the flaneur,\nthe automaton…), authors (Baudelaire, Fourier, Jung,\nMarx, Saint-Simon…) and their combinations. The project as a\nwhole received two ‘exposés’ or summaries, in 1935\nand 1939 (the second, in French). However, its scope and theoretical\nambition—nothing less than a philosophical construction of\n“the primal history of the nineteenth century” (BA,\n90)—joined with the circumstances of Benjamin’s life in exile\n(the constant need to earn money by writing and the uncertainty of a\npublisher for the project) to frustrate its realization. The only\nlengthy segment of completed text derives from the part devoted to\nBaudelaire (one of five parts in the 1939 exposé, cut down from\nsix in the initial 1935 version): the second of its three projected\nsections, ‘The Paris of the Second Empire in\nBaudelaire’—although even this was never published in\nBenjamin’s lifetime. However, the central chapter of this section,\n‘The Flaneur’, was revised and expanded (in part, in\nresponse to an exchange of letters with Adorno) into the essay\n‘Some Motifs in Baudelaire’, which was published in the\nInstitute’s journal, Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung\n(Journal for Social Research) in January 1940. A powerful\ncompressed draft of material corresponding to the final section, on\nthe commodity as a poetic object, exists as ‘Central Park’\n(SW 4, 161–199). As the project evolved, and in response to the\nbarriers to its realization, Baudelaire thus became increasingly\ncentral to Benjamin’s thinking.  (‘Convolute J’, on\nBaudelaire, is by far the longest of the convolutes.) Encouraged by\nHorkheimer, Benjamin planned to publish the material on Baudelaire as\na separate book, to be entitled, Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet\nin the Era of High Capitalism.  The development of this process,\nwhereby a primal history of the nineteenth century gradually morphed\ninto a book on Baudelaire and ‘high capitalism’, may be\nrepresented, diagrammatically, as follows. \n\nHowever, to reduce the project to its own, restricted de facto\ntrajectory, rich as it is, does too much violence to the historical and\nphilosophical framework it embodies, from which the material on\nBaudelaire gains its broader significance. The overarching historical\nframework is that of capitalist modernity as a ‘crisis of\nexperience’. (The two terms, capitalism and modernity, are\ninextricable for Benjamin in the context of 19th- and early\n20th-century Europe.) The founding problematic of Benjamin’s\nthought—the expansion of the Kantian concept of experience, to\ninfinity—is thus here provided with a concretely historical\ncontext, in which the notion of infinity/absoluteness becomes\nassociated with the concept of history itself. The problem: to\ndialectically redeem the concept of experience [Erfahrung]\nby finding an appropriate way of experiencing the crisis of experience\nitself. In classically ‘modern’ terms, the present is\ndefined as a time of crisis and transition, and philosophical\nexperience (truth) is associated with the glimpse within the present,\nvia the past, of a utopian political future that would bring history to\nan end. More immediately, the crisis is given political meaning by two\npossible resolutions: the one destructive; the other constructive/\nemancipatory—fascism and communism, respectively. In this\nrespect, for all his theoretical heterodoxy as a ‘Marxist’\nand his philosophical affinities with Adorno, Benjamin was in search\nof, and in solidarity with, new forms of collectivity connected to a\ncommunist future. Herein lay the basis of his friendship with Brecht.\nUnlike Brecht, however, he conceived them within the terms of a\nspeculative cultural history (Caygill 2004).  Within this framework, three distinct strands of work (discussed in\nthe next three sections) can be discerned: (1) investigation of the\ncrisis of experience via the ‘crisis of the arts’\n(SW  2, 212) through the interrelated terms\nof technology/technique\n[Technik], aura, reproducibility,\nand collectivity; (2) philosophical distillation of the\nformal structure of the experience of the new, and its historical and\npolitical contradictions, out of its social forms, and the examination\nof its relations to allegory and commodity-form; (3) construction of a\nnew historiography and a new philosophical concept of history. The\nfirst may be traced through a linked series of essays of which\n‘Surrealism: The Last Snapshot of the European\nIntelligentsia’ (1929), ‘Little History of\nPhotography’ (1931), ‘The Work of Art in the Age of its\nTechnical Reproducibility’ (1935–9) and ‘The\nStoryteller’ (1936) are the most important. The second is\nconcentrated in readings of Baudelaire and related texts by Nietzsche\nand Blanqui. (The focusing-in on these three thinkers is a focusing-in\non the relationship of capitalism to modernity in its purest,\nnihilistic form). The third is conjured from a reflective conjunction\nof Marx, Nietzsche and Surrealism. It takes methodological form in\n‘Convolute N [On the Theory of Knowledge, Theory of\nProgress]’ in The Arcades Project and achieved its\naccidentally definitive presentation in Benjamin’s most frequently\ncited, but still fiercely interpretatively disputed text (Caygill\n2004; Löwy 2005; Tiedemman 1989; Wohlfarth 1978): the\nfragments—known as theses—‘On the Concept of\nHistory’. That Benjamin approached the symptomatic significance of the\n‘crisis of the arts’ for the ‘crisis of\nexperience’ through the concept of Technik attests to\nthe fundamentally Marxist character of his conception of historical\ndevelopment. It is the development of the forces of production that is\nthe motor of history. However, Benjamin was no more orthodox a Marxist\nabout technology than he was with regard to the concept of progress,\nthe Marxist version of which the German Social Democratic Party (SPD)\ngrounded upon it (see Section 8, below). Not only did he recognize the\npotential for a “bloodbath” in a technology subjected to\n“the lust for profit” (SW  1, 487)—amply\ndemonstrated in the horrors of the First World War—but he came\nto distinguish between a ‘first’ and a\n‘second’, potentially liberatory technology, the latter\nmaking possible “a highly productive use of the human being’s\nself-alienation” (SW 3, 107; 113). It appears, in places, as the\nbasis for a kind of ‘technological cosmopolitics’ or\npolitics of a ‘new collective technoid body’ (Caygill\n2005, 225; Leslie 2000, 153, in Osborne 2005, II: 391). \nThe mastery of nature, so the imperialists teach, is the purpose of\nall technology [Technik]. But …technology is not the\nmastery of nature but of the relation between nature and\nhumanity. …In technology a physis is being organized\nthrough which mankind’s contact with the cosmos takes a new and\ndifferent form from that which it had in nations\n[Völkern] and families. (SW 1, 487, translation\namended) The collective is a body, too. And the physis that is\nbeing organized for it in technology can, through all its political\nand factual reality, only be produced in that image sphere to which\nprofane illumination initiates us. Only when in technology body and\nimage so interpenetrate that all revolutionary tension becomes bodily\ncollective innervation, and all the bodily innervations of the\ncollective become revolutionary discharge, has reality transcended\nitself to the extent demanded by the Communist Manifesto. (SW\n2, 217–8) These passages, from the concluding sections of One-Way Street\nand the ‘Surrealism’ essay, respectively, convey something\nof the ecstatic character of Benjamin’s political thought at the\noutset of the 1930s, in which technology appears on a political\nknife-edge between its possibilities as “a fetish of doom”\nand “a key to happiness” (SW 2, 321). Art—an art of\nthe masses—appears within this scenario as the educative\nmechanism through which the body of the collective can begin to\nappropriate its own technological potential. In his footnote to this passage from the second version of\n‘The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical\nReproducibility’ (‘Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner\ntechnischen Reproduzierbarkeit’, 1936), Benjamin refers us\nto the ‘phalansteries’, the “self-contained agrarian\ncollectives” of Fourier’s socialist utopia. In the Fourier\nconvolute of the Arcades Project, these are compared to the\ntwo main articles of Benjamin’s politics: “the idea of\nrevolution as an innervation of the technical organs of the\ncollective… and the idea of the ‘cracking open of natural\nteleology’” (AP, [W7, 4], 631). For Benjamin, art, in the\nform of film—the “unfolding <result> of all the\nforms of perception, the tempos and rhythms, which lie preformed in\ntoday’s machines”—thus harboured the possibility of\nbecoming a kind of rehearsal of the revolution. “[A]ll problems\nof contemporary art”, Benjamin insisted, “find their\ndefinitive formulation only in the context of film” (AP, [K3,\n3], 394). In this respect, it was the combination of the communist\npedagogy and constructive devices of Brecht’s epic theatre that marked\nit out for him as a theatre for the age of film (UB, 1–25;\nWizisla 2009). Benjamin’s writings on film are justly renowned for their twin\ntheses of the transformation of the concept of art by its\n‘technical reproducibility’ and the new possibilities for\ncollective experience this contains, in the wake of the historical\ndecline of the ‘aura’ of the work of art, a process that\nfilm is presented as definitively concluding. Much ink has been spilt\ndebating the thesis of the decline of the aura in Benjamin’s\nwork. On the one hand, with regard to some of his writings,\nBenjamin’s concept of aura has been accused of fostering a\nnostalgic, purely negative sense of modernity as loss—loss of\nunity both with nature and in community (A. Benjamin 1989). On the\nother hand, in the work on film, Benjamin appears to adopt an\naffirmative technological modernism, which celebrates the consequences\nof the decline. Adorno, for one, felt betrayed by the latter position.\nHe wrote to Benjamin on 18 March 1936: Brecht himself, meanwhile, was appalled by even the residually\nnegative function of the aura, recording his response in\nhis Workbook: “it is all mysticism mysticism, in a\nposture opposed to mysticism. … it is rather ghastly”\n(cited in Buck-Morss 1977, 149). Yet Adorno did not defend\n‘auratic art’ as such. (His defence of autonomous art was\ngrounded on the experience derived from following the\n‘autonomous’ technical development of laws of form.) Clearly, the concept of the aura plays a number of different roles\nin Benjamin’s writings, in his various attempts to grasp his\nhistorical present in terms of the possibilities for\n‘experience’ afforded by its new cultural forms; which he\nincreasingly came to identify (some say precipitously) with\nrevolutionary political potential. Yet Adorno was wrong to see a simple\nchange of position, rather than a complex series of inflections of what\nwas a generally consistent historical account. Benjamin had written\naffirmatively of “the emancipation of object from aura” as\nearly as 1931, in his ‘Little History of Photography’, in\nwhich he described Atget’s photographs as “suck[ing] the\naura out of reality like water from a sinking ship” (SW 2, 518).\nIt is here that we find the basic definition of aura: “A strange\nweave of space and time: the unique appearance or semblance of\ndistance, no matter how close it may be.” Importantly, the\nexamples given with this definition are from nature: mountains and a\nbranch observed “at rest on a summer’s noon … until\nthe moment or the hour become part of their appearance…”.\nThe ‘destruction’ of the aura by transience and\nreproducibility is judged “a salutary estrangement” (SW 2,\n518–9). Similarly, when ‘The Storyteller’ recounts\nthe “dying out of the art of storytelling” and “the\nincomparable aura that surrounds the storyteller”, it is\nnonetheless maintained: “nothing could be more fatuous than to\nwish to see it as merely a ‘symptom of decay’, let alone a\n‘modern symptom’. It is rather, only a concomitant of the\nsecular productive forces of history…” (SW 3, 146; 162).\n‘The Work of Art’ essay extends and enriches the earlier\naccount of photography’s technological transformation of\nperception (“the optical unconscious”) with reference to\nfilm. The difference resides in the insistent political dimension of\nthe later essay (after Hitler’s taking of power in 1933), and its\ndetermination to introduce concepts “that are completely useless\nfor the purposes of fascism” (SW 3, 102). The main problem with\nthe auratic (which is deemed historically residual, not eliminated,\nindeed is perhaps ineliminable [Didi-Huberman 2004]) was that, Benjamin\nbelieved, it was precisely “useful for fascism”. This\ncontext over-determines the essay throughout, with its almost Manichean\noppositions between ritual and politics, cult value and exhibition\nvalue. Quite apart from the intervening technological and social\ndevelopments, it makes it a very difficult text simply to\n‘use’ today. For some, however, it is precisely the\nconnection it draws between a certain kind of mass culture and fascism\nthat provides its continuing relevance (Buck-Morss 1992). \nBenjamin’s thinking of ‘the modern’ [die Moderne]\nis his most important theoretical contribution to the historical study\nof cultural forms. Frequently mistranslated in early English-language\neditions of his writings as ‘modernism’, and still often\nrendered as ‘modernity’ (although Benjamin tended to\nretain Baudelaire’s coinage, la modernité, when making\nthat reference), die Moderne designates both a formal\ntemporal structure and the diverse range of its historical\ninstances—past and present. Baudelaire is the main writer\nthrough whom Benjamin thought ‘the modern’; not as might\nbe expected, with reference to the canonical account\nof modernité in ‘The Painter of Modern\nLife’ (1859/60), but with regard to what Benjamin called the\n‘theory’ of the modern first set down in ‘The Salon\nof 1845’: “the advent of the true new (die Heraufkunft\ndes wahrhaft Neunen)” (SW 4, 45–6, translation\namended; GS 1.2, 580).  In Baudelaire’s ‘The Painter’ essay, modernité\nfamously denotes ‘the ephemeral, the fugitive, the\ncontingent’. It is associated with transitoriness as the\ngeneralized social instantiation of the temporality of the modern, in\nthe capitalist metropolis. In contrast to transitoriness as such,\nhowever, Benjamin was first and foremost (politically and\nphilosophically) interested in ‘the new’, in its\n‘advent’ or historical becoming, and in its quality as\nnewness or novelty (the newness of the new), in a way that was\nconceptually distinct from the conventional opposition of the\n‘modern’ to the ‘ancient’—which\nBaudelaire notoriously retained. As a result, Benjamin was consequently\nalso interested in what the German sociologist Max Weber would have\ncalled its ‘routinization’ (although Benjamin did not use\nthis vocabulary): the routinization accompanying the generalization of\nthe new as a mode of experience—in fashion and boredom, in\nparticular—and the formal structure of sameness involved in its\nrepetition. It is here that transitoriness enters the picture—as \na result of the generalization of novelty. Baudelaire\nself-consciously embraced modernity with ‘heroic effort’,\nattempting, like the painter of modern life, to ‘extract its epic\naspects’ and ‘distill the eternal from the\ntransitory’; Benjamin, on the other hand, sought to understand it\nin order to find a way out of what he called its ‘hell’. He\npicked up on the relationship of the transitory to the eternal in\nBaudelaire’s account of modernity, but first, he de-classicized\nthe notion of the ‘eternal’, refiguring it philosophically,\nand second, he rendered the relationship itself strictly dialectical:\nin the modern, it is transitoriness itself that is eternalized. Thus, Benjamin did not so much take over and update Baudelaire’s\nportrayal of modernity as read it ‘symptomatically’ (in\nLouis Althusser’s sense), or more precisely, allegorically, in order\nto uncover beneath it the experience of the transformation of\nhistorical time by the commodity form.  Baudelaire was able to\ngrasp this experience, according to Benjamin, through the\ncontradictory historical temporality that structured his work: at once\nresolutely modern yet, in its poetic form (lyric), already\nanachronistic. Benjamin similarly valued the disjunctive historical\ntemporality of Kafka’s fables: their status as parables after the\n‘end of storytelling’. But whereas Kafka was for Benjamin\n“the figure of a failure” (BS, 226)—the inevitable\nfailure of an attempt to translate the experience [Erlebnis]\nof modernity into the language of tradition\n(Judaism)—Baudelaire’s poetry was able to convey the intensity\nof the experience of modernity through the very tension between that\nexperience and his chosen, lyrical means; not merely negatively (like\nKafka), but via the way in which modernity transformed those means. In\nparticular, the lyric allowed Baudelaire to register the full effect\nof the temporality of the modern on the dissolution of subjectivity,\nand the fact that it consequently “takes a heroic constitution\nto live the modern [die Moderne]” (SW 4, 44,\ntranslation amended; GS 1.2, 577). The extraction of the metropolitan\n‘motifs’ for which Benjamin’s reading of Baudelaire is\njustly famous—the bohemian, the flaneur, the prostitute, the\ngambler, the ragpicker—are the figures via which this structure\nof experience appears. Primary within Baudelaire, they are nonetheless\nmethodologically secondary for Benjamin, as he explained to Adorno:\n“I only have to insert [them] in the appropriate place”\n(BA, 90). Baudelaire had found a method—what he called\n‘correspondences’—which reflectively incorporated\nthe anachronism of the lyric form into his work. Benjamin appropriated\nthis method, with its dissociated ‘ritual elements’ (SW 4,\n333), to read Baudelaire himself.  In the essay ‘Some Motifs in\nBaudelaire’, correspondences of temporal structure, experienced\nas ‘shock’, link the machine, the film, the crowd, and the\ngame of chance:  \nWhat determines the rhythm of production on a conveyor\nbelt is the same thing that underlies the rhythm of reception in the\nfilm. … The shock experience [Chockerlebnis] which the\npasser-by has in the crowd corresponds to the isolated\n‘experiences’ of the worker at his machine. … The\njolt in the movement of a machine is like the so-called coup in a game\nof chance…. (SW 4, 328–30) A single repetitive and dissociated formal temporal structure is\ndetected beneath the rich array of phenomenological forms presented in\nBaudelaire’s poetry: “the price for which the sensation of\nthe modern could be had: the disintegration of the aura in shock\nexperience”. (SW 4, 343, translation amended; GS 1.2, 653)  Furthermore, this interpretative key, the experience of shock, is\nitself understood through a series of theoretical correspondences\nwithin Benjamin’s own present; primarily, that between\nProust’s ‘involuntary memory’ and Freud’s\ntheory of consciousness. This theoretical correspondence is read in the\nlight of the ‘shell shock’ first diagnosed during the First\nWorld War, about which Benjamin had previously written in his\nreflections on Ernst Junger in his 1930 review essay, ‘Theories\nof German Fascism’ (SW 2, 312–321). The connection of the\nmodern to fascism does not appear solely through the thematic of the\nfalse restoration of the aura, but also within the process of its\ndisintegration by shock. (Structurally, the shock of the crowd is\n‘like’ shell shock.) Baudelaire is thus not merely the\nprivileged writer for the advent of the theory of the modern, but the\none in whose work the nineteenth century appears most clearly as the\nfore-life of the present. However, if it was through Baudelaire that\nBenjamin grasped the structure of the temporality of the\n‘modern’, it was through Nietzsche and Blanqui that he\nexplored its ambiguous historical meaning, via the way in which their\nphilosophies reflect the transformation of the new by the commodity\ninto the ‘ever selfsame’. “Just as in the seventeenth\ncentury it is allegory that becomes the canon of dialectical images, in\nthe nineteenth century it is novelty” (AP, 11):  “The\ncommodity has taken the place of the allegorical mode of\napprehension.” (SW 4, 188)  It is the fragment ‘Central Park’ that most clearly\nreveals the consequences of Benjamin’s reading of Baudelaire for his\nconcept of history: the modern completely transforms the possibilities\nfor the experience of history. On the one hand, it de-historicizes\nexperience, wresting it away from the temporal continuities of\ntradition. On the other hand, a messianic structure—an opening\nof history to something outside of time—reasserts itself within\nthe still life [nature mort] of modernity’s restless\nsameness. This is Benjamin’s famous ‘dialectics at a\nstandstill’ (Tiedemann, 1982). It transforms the historical\nnaturalism of the baroque, analyzed in the Origin of the German\nMourning-Play (Section 4, above), in a futural direction. In\nparticular, it involves a prioritization of the interruptive stasis of\nthe image over the continuity of temporal succession. In fact,\nBenjamin maintained: “The concept of historical time forms an\nantithesis to the idea of a temporal continuum” (SW 4, 407).]\n  Debate over Benjamin’s conception of history was for many years\npreoccupied with the question of whether it is essentially\n‘theological’ or ‘materialist’ in character\n(or how it could possibly be both at once), occasioned by the\nconjunction of Benjamin’s self-identification with historical\nmaterialism and his continued use of explicitly messianic motifs\n(Wolhfarth 1978; Tiedemann 1983–4). This was in large part the\npolemical legacy of the competing influence of three\nfriendships—with Gershom Scholem, Theodor W. Adorno and Bertolt\nBrecht—applied to the interpretation of Benjamin’s final text,\nthe fragments ‘On the Concept of History’\n(‘Über den Begriff der Geschichte’,\npopularly known as the ‘Theses on the Philosophy of\nHistory’). Scholem promoted a theological interpretation, Brecht\ninspired a materialist one, while Adorno attempted to forge some form\nof compatibility between the two. Yet the question is badly posed if\nit is framed within received concepts of ‘theology’ and\n‘materialism’ (the paradox becomes self-sustaining), since\nit was Benjamin’s aim radically to rethink the meaning of these ideas,\non the basis of a new philosophy of historical time. This new\nphilosophy of historical time is the ultimate goal of Benjamin’s later\nwritings. It appears most explicitly, under construction, in\n‘Convolute N’ of The Arcades Project, ‘On\nthe Theory of Knowledge, Theory of Progress’; it is applied to\nart history in the 1937 essay ‘Eduard Fuch, Collector and\nHistorian’; and is manifest in a condensed, rhetorically\npolitical and problematic form in ‘On the Concept of\nHistory’. It derives from a dual critique of the ‘vulgar\nnaturalism’ of historicism and the deferral of action\ninvolved in the associated Social Democratic concept\nof progress (Kittsteiner 1986).  It gives rise to a\nconception of historical intelligibility based on ‘literary\nmontage’ as the method of construction of ‘dialectical\nimages’ (AP, 460–1). And it culminates in a\nquasi-messianic conception of revolution as an\n‘interruption’ of history or an ‘arrest of\nhappening’: “Classless society is not the final goal of\nhistorical progress but its frequently miscarried, ultimately achieved\ninterruption” (SW 4, 402). Benjamin took as one of the main ‘methodological\nobjectives’ of his Arcades Project “to\ndemonstrate a historical materialism which has annihilated within\nitself the idea of progress”, taking as its “founding\nconcept… not progress but actualization”  (AP, [N2,\n2], 460). He had both philosophical and political reasons for\nthis. Philosophically, Benjamin saw the conventional idea of progress\nas projecting into the future a conception of time as\n‘homogenous’ and ‘empty’ epitomized by the\nattempt of Ranke’s historicism to represent the past “the way it\nreally was” (SW4, 395; 391). This is a conception of time based\non the temporal continuity of past, present and future,\n‘in’ which events occur and are understood as causally\nconnected. It is naturalistic in so far as it acknowledges no\nfundamental temporal-ontological distinction between past, present and\nfuture time; it has no sense of time as the ongoing production of\ntemporal differentiation. Time is differentiated solely by the\ndifferences between the events that occur within it. In particular, it\nfails to grasp that historical time (the time of human life) is\nconstituted through such immanent differentiations, via the\nexistential modes of memory, expectation and action. In this respect,\nthere are affinities between Benjamin’s philosophy of time and\nHeidegger’s (Caygill, 1994).  The political consequence of the temporal naturalism underlying the\nidea of ‘progress’ is conformism. For Benjamin,\nparadoxically, this applied in particular to the German Social\nDemocrats’ understanding of communism as an ideal, in the\nneo-Kantian ethical sense of the object of an ‘endless\ntask’:\n In other words, the concept of progress is demobilizing; and Marxism\nhad become infected by the ideology of progress. However, rather than\npositing an existential alternative, in the manner of Heidegger’s\n‘resolute decision’, Benjamin set out to construct novel\nconceptions of historical time and historical intelligibility based on\nthe relationship, not between the past and the present, but between the\n‘then’ and the ‘now’, as brought together in\nimages of the past. Each historically specific ‘now’ was\nunderstood to correspond to (in a Baudelairean sense), or to render\nlegible, a particular ‘then’.  The experimental method of montage, borrowed from surrealism, was to\nbe the means of production of historical intelligibility. Furthermore,\nthe ‘static’ temporality of the image was understood to\nconnect such an experience of historical meaning, directly, to a\nradical or ‘revolutionary’ concept of action, associated\nwith the idea of the present as crisis. The passage above continues: Such “perilous critical moments” are both immanent to\nthe temporality of modernity, at a structural level (the temporality of\ncrisis), and, in each particular case, contingent and conjuncturally\nspecific. In them, the past is understood “to bring the present\ninto a critical state”. However, this critical state is not a\ncrisis of the status quo, but rather of its destruction: the critical\nmoment is that in which “the status quo threatens to be\npreserved” (AP, [N10, 2], 474). Dialectical images counter the\nthreat of preservation (tradition) by virtue of the interruptive force\nthey are understood to impart to experience as a consequence of the\ninstantaneous temporality of the now, or what Benjamin famously called\nnow-time [Jetztzeit]:\n“The dialectical image is an image that emerges suddenly, in a\nflash” (AP, [N9, 7], 473). It is this image of the image as a\n‘flash’ [ein aufblitzendes]\nand the corresponding image of historical experience as the discharge\nof an explosive force—the explosive force of now-time, blasting\nopen ‘the continuum of history’—for which Benjamin\nis probably best known. The philosophy of historical time which these\nimages sum up was elaborated by him in two main contexts: the\ndevelopment of a new conception of cultural history and a political\ndiagnosis of the historical crisis of Europe at the outset of the\nSecond World War. Benjamin did not see culture as threatened by\n‘barbarism’, so much as itself being implicated in\nit: The concept of culture as the values of a heritage was for Benjamin\n‘fetishistic’: “Culture appears reified.” Only\nan understanding of “the crucial importance of reception…\nenables us to correct the process of reification which takes place in\na work of art” (SW 3, 267; 269). For Benjamin, however,\nreception—or what he called the ‘afterlife’\n[Nachleben] of the work—was not merely something that\nhappened to the work, externally; it was as constitutive of\nthe work itself as its ‘fore-life’ [Vorleben], or\nconditions of production—which are themselves rendered invisible\nby the idea of culture as value, and are themselves “involved in\na constant process of change” as the work itself changes. A\nmaterialist cultural history would restore to the experience of works\na sense of both of these changing sets of conditions (before and\nafter), and the conflicts between them, in an engagement\n“originary for every present”, since “[i]t is the\npresent that polarizes the event into fore- and\nafter-history”  (SW 3, 261–2; AP, [N7a, 8], 471). It\nis here, in an ontological rethinking of reception, that the\nphilosophical significance of Benjamin’s interest in technologies of\nreproduction lies. With these concepts of fore- and afterlife,\nBenjamin founded a new problematic for cultural study. Benjamin was interested in ‘culture’ not as an\nautonomous realm of values (“the independent values of aesthetic,\nscientific, ethical… and even religious achievements”),\nbut on the contrary, like the sociologist Georg Simmel, whose Philosophy of Money\nhe cities in this regard, as “elements in the development of\nhuman nature” (Simmel, quoted in AP, [N14, 3], 480). In this\nrespect, cultural study is situated within the field of a materialist\nphilosophy of history. And the philosophy of history insists on a\nconception of history as a whole. It is here than the messianic\nstructure of Benajmin’s concept of history confronts us as\nunavoidable; although not thereby necessarily\n‘theological’, since it is the transition of a conceptual\nstructure from one philosophical context into another that is at issue\n(Benjamin’s favorite surrealist method of\n‘decontextualization’ and ‘defamiliarization’),\nnot its meaning in its original theological context as such. In his\nsearch for a non-Hegelian, non-developmentalist conception of history\nas a whole, in ‘On the Concept of History’ Benjamin figured\nnow-time, quasi-messianically, alternatively as a ‘model’\nof messianic time and as “shot through with splinters of\nmessianic time.” In the context of a diagnosis of the European\ncrisis of 1939–40 as a world-historical crisis, the\n‘critical state of the present’ thus came, in this text, to\nacquire a theological-political tenor. “A revolutionary chance in\nthe fight for the oppressed past” is compared to “the sign\nof a messianic arrest of happening” (SW 4, 396–7). Benjamin\nwas aware that this rhetoric would lead to misunderstanding. But the\ncombination of perceived political urgency and isolation compelled him\nto extend his concept of history beyond the state of his philosophical\nresearch, experimentally, into an apparently definitive statement. It\nis as if Benjamin had hoped to overcome the aporia of action within his\nstill essentially hermeneutical philosophy (Osborne 1995) through the\nforce of language alone. Formally, however, ‘On the Concept of\nHistory’ should be read as a series of fragments, in the early\nRomantic sense. As such, it remains resolutely negative—and\nthereby importantly partial—in its evocation of the historical\nwhole, which is acknowledged as unpresentable. In this respect,\nBenjamin’s final text recalls his earliest major publication, the\n1919 thesis ‘The Concept of Art Criticism in German\nRomanticism’: as a gesture towards the philosophy of history\nneeded to complete a modified and ‘modernized’ version of\nthe early Romantic project.","contact.mail":"p.osborne@kingston.ac.uk","contact.domain":"kingston.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2011-01-18","date.changed":"2020-10-14","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/benjamin/","author1":"Peter Osborne","author1.info":"http://westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/charles-matthew/","entry":"benjamin","body.text":"\n\n\nWalter Benjamin’s importance as a philosopher and critical\ntheorist can be gauged by the diversity of his intellectual influence\nand the continuing productivity of his thought. Primarily regarded as a\nliterary critic and essayist, the philosophical basis of\nBenjamin’s writings is increasingly acknowledged. They were a\ndecisive influence upon Theodor W. Adorno’s conception of\nphilosophy’s actuality or adequacy to the present (Adorno 1931).\nIn the 1930s, Benjamin’s efforts to develop a politically\noriented, materialist aesthetic theory proved an important stimulus\nfor both the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory and the Marxist poet\nand dramatist Bertolt Brecht.  \n\n\nThe delayed appearance of Benjamin’s collected writings has determined\nand sustained the Anglophone reception of his work. (A two-volume\nselection was published in German in 1955, with a full edition not\nappearing until 1972–89, and a 21-volume critical edition has been in production since 2008; English anthologies first appeared in\n1968 and 1978, and the four-volume Selected Writings between\n1996 and 2003.) Originally received in the context of literary\ntheory and aesthetics, only in the last decades of the 20th century did the philosophical depth and cultural breadth of Benjamin’s thought begin to be fully appreciated. Despite the voluminous size of the secondary literature\nthat it has produced, his work remains a continuing source of\nproductivity. An understanding of the intellectual context of his work\nhas contributed to the philosophical revival of Early German\nRomanticism. His philosophy of language has played a seminal role in translation theory. His essay on ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Its\nTechnical Reproducibility’ remains a major theoretical text for\nfilm theory. One-Way Street and the work arising from his\nunfinished research on nineteenth century Paris (The Arcades\nProject), provide a theoretical stimulus for cultural theory and\nphilosophical concepts of the modern. Benjamin’s messianic\nunderstanding of history has been an enduring source of theoretical\nfascination and frustration for a diverse range of philosophical\nthinkers, including Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben and, in a\ncritical context, Jürgen Habermas. The ‘Critique of\nViolence’ and ‘On the Concept of History’ are\nimportant sources for Derrida’s discussion of messianicity, which has\nbeen influential, along with Paul de Man’s discussion of allegory, for\nthe poststructuralist reception of Benjamin’s writings. Aspects of\nBenjamin’s thought have also been associated with a revival of\npolitical theology, although it is doubtful this reception is true to\nthe tendencies of Benjamin’s own political thought. More recently,\ninterest in Benjamin’s philosophy of education has been fueled by the\ntranslations of his Early Writings in 2011 and the\ntranscripts of his radio broadcasts for children (Radio\nBenjamin) in 2014.\n\nWalter Bendix Schoenflies Benjamin was born on July 15, 1892, the\neldest of three children in a prosperous Berlin family from an\nassimilated Jewish background. At the age of 13, after a prolonged\nperiod of sickness, Benjamin was sent to a progressive co-educational\nboarding school in Haubinda, Thuringia, where he formed an important\nintellectual kinship with the liberal educational reformer Gustav\nWyneken. On his return to Berlin, he began contributing to Der Anfang\n(‘The Beginning’), a journal dedicated to Wyneken’s\nprinciples on the spiritual purity of youth, articles which contain in\nembryonic form important ideas on experience and history that continue\nto occupy his mature thought. As a student at the universities of\nFreiburg im Breisgau and Berlin, Benjamin attended lectures by the\nneo-Kantian philosopher Heinrich Rickert and the sociologist Georg\nSimmel, whilst continuing to be actively involved in the growing Youth\nMovement. In 1914, however, Benjamin denounced his mentor and withdrew\nfrom the movement in response to a public lecture in which Wyneken\npraised the ethical experience that the outbreak of war afforded the\nyoung. In 1915 a friendship began between Benjamin and Gerhard (later\nGershom) Scholem, a fellow student at Berlin. This relationship would\nhave a lifelong influence upon Benjamin’s relation to Judaism and\nKabbalism, notably in his interpretations of Kafka in the early 1930s\nand in the messianic interpretation of the Paul Klee painting Angelus Novus in\nhis later theses ‘On the Concept of History’. Scholem would\nprove instrumental in establishing and, in part, shaping the legacy of\nBenjamin’s works after his death (Raz-Krakotzkin 2013).  \nBenjamin’s doctoral dissertation, ‘The Concept of Art Criticism\nin German Romanticism’, was awarded, summa cum laude, by\nthe University of Bern, Switzerland, in 1919. His celebrated essay on\nGoethe’s novella, The Elective Affinities, was begun shortly\nafter and put into practice the theory of art criticism developed in\nhis dissertation. Benjamin’s Habilitationsschrift on\nthe Origin of the German Mourning-Play (Ursprung des\ndeutschen Trauerspiels)—the thesis which would have enabled\nhim to become a professional academic—had, he feared, with the\ndeath of his intellectual ally, the Protestant theologian Florens\nChristian Rang, lost its “proper reader” (GB 3:16). In 1925, he was forced to withdraw his submission from the\nUniversity of Frankfurt am Main and with it the possibility of a\nfuture academic position. However, despite this academic\nfailure, an excerpt from the work appeared in a literary journal two\nyears later and the book was published the following year (1928),\nquickly receiving favourable attention in a number of well regarded\nnewspapers and periodicals in Germany and further afield (Brodersen\n1996, 154). In an ironic twist, Benjamin’s\nfailed Habilitation study became the subject of a seminar\ncourse taught at Frankfurt University in 1932–3 by Theodor\nWiesengrund (later Theodor W. Adorno). \nMuch of the writing for his thesis was completed in 1924 on the Italian\nisland of Capri, where Benjamin had retreated for financial reasons.\nThe stay would prove decisive, however, since it was here he met the\nBolshevik Latvian theatre producer Asja Lacis, with whom he begun an\nerotically frustrated but intellectually productive relationship.\n‘Naples’ was jointly written with Lacis in 1925, whilst One-Way Street,\na quasi-constructivist collection of fragments written between\n1923–1926 and dedicated to Lacis on its publication in 1928, and the\nunfinished Arcades Project,\nbegun in the late 1920s, both exhibit a modernist experimentation with\nform that can in part be attributed to Lacis’ influence. His\nMarxist turn towards historical materialism was compounded by his\nenthusiastic study of Georg Lukács’ History and Class Consciousness\nwhilst on Capri and a visit to Lacis in Soviet Moscow in the winter of\n1926–7. By the early 1930s Benjamin was closely involved in the plans\nfor a left-wing periodical to be entitled ‘Crisis and\nCritique’, in collaboration with Ernst Bloch, Sigfried Kracauer\nand, among others, the Marxist poet, playwright and theatre director\nBertolt Brecht (Wizisla 2009, 66–98). Benjamin had been introduced\nto Brecht by Lacis in 1929 and over the following decade developed a\nclose personal friendship, in which their literary and political\naffinities had been cemented under the difficult conditions of\npolitical exile. Benjamin undertook a series of studies of\nBrecht’s “epic theatre” and modelled the radio\nbroadcasts he wrote and presented during this period upon the\nlatter’s experiments in theatrical didacticism (Brodersen\n1996, 193). In 1933, Benjamin departed Nazi Germany for the last time,\nfollowing Adorno, Brecht and many other Jewish friends into an exile he\ndivided between Paris, Ibiza, San Remo and Brecht’s house near\nSvendborg, Denmark. \n\nDuring the 1930s the Institute for Social Research, by this point\nunder the directorship of Horkheimer and exiled from its base in the\nUniversity of Frankfurt, provided Benjamin with important\nopportunities for publishing as well as an increasingly necessary\nfinancial stipend.  Theodor W. Adorno, who had been introduced to\nBenjamin a decade earlier by a mutual friend, Siegfried Kracauer, was\ninstrumental in securing this support. An important consequence of\nthis dependence, however, was the editorial revisions to which key\nessays in which Benjamin developed his materialist theory of art were\nsubjected, such as ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical\nReproducibility’ and those on Baudelaire and Paris that grew out\nof The Arcades Project. With the outbreak of war in 1939, Benjamin was temporarily interned\nin the French “concentration camps” established for German\ncitizens. On his release a few months later he returned to Paris and\nthere continued his work in the Bibliothèque Nationale\non The Arcades Project.  The notes for his unfinished\nresearch were left in the safekeeping of librarian and friend, the\nwriter Georges Bataille, as Benjamin fled Paris before the advancing\nGerman army in the summer of 1940. The last few months of Benjamin’s\nlife reflect the precarious experience of countless other Jewish\nGermans in Vichy France: a flight to the border and preparations for\nemigration by legal or illegal means. Lacking the necessary exit visa\nfrom France, he joined a guided party that crossed the Pyrenees in an\nattempt to enter Spain as illegal refugees. Turned back by customs\nofficials, Benjamin took his life in the small, Spanish border town of\nPort Bou, on September 27, 1940.\n \n\nThe importance of Benjamin’s early unpublished fragments for an\nunderstanding his wider philosophical project has been emphasised by a\nnumber of scholars (Wolfharth 1992; Caygill 1998; Rrenban 2005).\nIndeed, without them it becomes difficult to understand the\nintellectual context and historical tradition out of which Benjamin is\nwriting and therefore nearly impossible to grasp the philosophical\nunderpinnings of his works. Of Benjamin’s earliest published\nwriting his attempt in the essay entitled ‘Experience’\n(‘Erfahrung’, 1913/1914) to distinguish an\nalternative and superior concept of experience provides a useful\nintroduction to a central and enduring preoccupation of his\nthought. Benjamin’s concern with delineating an immediate and\nmetaphysical experience of spirit is valuable in providing a thematic\ndescription of a conceptual opposition working throughout his\nthought. Filtered here through the cultural ideals of the Youth\nMovement, this contrasts the empty, spiritless [Geistlosen]\nand unartistic “experiences” accumulated over a life\nmerely lived-through [erlebt] with that privileged kind of\nexperience which is filled with spiritual content through its enduring\ncontact with the dreams of youth (SW 1, 3–6). The influence of\nNietzsche in these earlier texts is discernible (McFarland 2013),\nparticularly, in the importance the young Benjamin places upon\naesthetic experience in overcoming the embittered nihilism of\ncontemporary values (although he is unable to articulate this cultural\ntransformation here beyond a vague appeal to the canon of German\npoets: Schiller, Goethe, Hölderlin, and Stefan Georg). By 1918 the attempt at a more systematic and philosophically\nsophisticated understanding of a “higher concept of\nexperience” (SW 1, 102) within what Benjamin now calls “the\ncoming philosophy” is articulated in relation to Kant’s\ntranscendental idealism. Benjamin argues that the value of Platonic and\nKantian philosophy lies in its attempt to secure the scope and depth of\nknowledge through justification, exemplified in the way Kant conducts a\ncritical inquiry into the transcendental conditions of knowledge. But\nthis Kantian attempt to grasp a certain and timeless knowledge is in\nturn based upon an empirical concept of experience which is restricted,\nBenjamin argues, to that “naked, primitive, self evident”\nexperience of the Enlightenment, whose paradigm is Newtonian physics\n(SW 1, 101). Despite Kant’s introduction of a transcendental\nsubject, his system remains tied to a naïve empiricist\nunderstanding of experience, of the kind privileged in the positivist\nscientific tradition as the encounter between a distinct subject\n(conceived as a cognizing consciousness receiving sensible intuitions)\nand object (understood as a sensation-causing thing-in-itself). In contrast, the pre-Enlightenment concept of experience invested\nthe world with a deeper and more profound significance, because the\nCreation assumes a revelatory religious importance. This is apparent\nnot only in the deeply Christian world-view of mediaeval Europe, but\nsurvives in secularized form in Renaissance and Baroque humanism, and\nin “Counter-Enlightenment” thinkers such as J. G. Hamann,\nGoethe, and the Romantics. Benjamin suggests that the “great\ntransformation and correction which must be performed upon the concept\nof experience, oriented so one-sidedly along mathematical-mechanical\nlines, can be attained only by relating knowledge to language, as was\nattempted by Hamann during Kant’s lifetime” (SW 1, 107–8).\nIn the essay ‘On Language as Such and the Language of Man’\n(‘Über Sprache überhaupt und über die Sprache\ndes Menschen’, c. 1916), Benjamin offers a theological\nconception of language which draws on Hamann’s discussion of Creation\nas the physical imprint of the divine Word of God, to claim that there\n“is no event or thing in either animate or inanimate nature that\ndoes not in some way partake of language” (SW 1,\n62–3). This implies that all experience—including\nperception—is essentially linguistic, whilst all human language\n(including writing, typically associated with mere convention) is\ninherently expressive and creative.  Language is privileged as a model\nof experience in these early essays precisely because it undermines\nand transgresses the neat divisions and limitations operating in the\nKantian system, including that fundamental one that distinguishes\nbetween the subject and object of sensations. If both are\nconstitutively linguistic, language serves as a medium of experience\nthat binds the ostensible “subject” and\n“object” in a more profound, perhaps mystical,\nrelationship of underlying kinship. More generally, Hamann’s\nmetacritique provides Benjamin with a sense of the hypocrisy of the\nKantian separation of understanding and sensibility on the basis of an\nempty and purely formal notion of pure reason, which can itself only\nbe postulated according to the concrete, aesthetic content of\nlanguage. \nWhilst Benjamin is not interested in returning to the pre-critical\nproject of a rationalist deduction of experience, nor to a directly\nreligious conception of the world, he is interested in how the\nscientific concept of experience that Kant is utilising distorts the\nstructure of Kant’s philosophical system, and how this might be\ncorrected with the use of theological concepts. Epistemology must\naddress not only “the question of the certainty of knowledge that\nis lasting”, but also the neglected question of “the\nintegrity of an experience that is ephemeral” (SW 1, 100).\nBenjamin’s suggestion as to how this project might be formulated\nwithin the Kantian system is sketchy, but nonetheless indicates some of\nthe preoccupying concerns of his later writings. In general, it\ninvolves the expansion of the limited spatio-temporal forms and\nessentially causal-mechanistic categories of Kant’s philosophy\nthrough the integration of, for example, religious, historical,\nartistic, linguistic and psychological experiences. Benjamin’s\nenduring concern with the new, the outmoded and the heteronomous\nreflect this attempt to integrate more speculative phenomenological\npossibilities of experience into the remit of philosophical\nknowledge. It resists privileging any single discipline of knowledge,\npreserving a multiplicity that implicates truth in the problem of\naesthetic representation. This would lead Benjamin to attempt a radical\nrethinking of the philosophical concept of the Idea, away from its\ndualistic associations with a timeless and purely rational essence of\nthings. Benjamin also believes that a more speculative metaphysics would\nnecessitate the abolishment of the sharp distinction between Nature\nand Freedom—or causal mechanism and moral willing—in\nKant’s architectonic. Since it is a specific understanding of\n“dialectic” which mediates between these two spheres in\nKant’s critical system, this entails a speculative rethinking of the\nKantian dialectic. This suggests that new possibilities of syllogistic\nlogical relations might themselves be opened up, including what he\ncalls “a certain nonsynthesis of two concepts in another”\n(SW 1, 106; cf. Weber 2008, 48). The relation of nonsynthesis hinted\nat here can be seen to inform Benjamin’s understanding of the Idea as\na constellation of extremes in the Origin of the German\nMourning-Play and of the dialectical image in his mature\nwritings. In this sense, Benjamin’s metacritique of Kant represents an\nattempt to construct an alternative post-Kantian tradition to that of\nHegelian dialectics. It therefore required a new philosophy of\nhistory. Benjamin initially sought to develop these ideas in the context of\nKant’s philosophy of history, believing it was in this context that\nthe problems of the Kantian system could be fully exposed and\nchallenged (C, 98). A very early article, ‘The Life of\nStudents’ (‘Das Leben der Studenten’,\n1915), is useful for suggesting how these problems manifest themselves\nwithin the philosophy of history. It rejects a “a view of\nhistory that puts its faith in the infinite extent of time and thus\nconcerns itself only with the speed, or lack of it, with which people\nand epochs advance along the path of progress” and contrasts\nthis with a perspective “in which history appears to be\nconcentrated on a single focal point, like those that had\ntraditionally been found in the utopian images of the\nphilosophers” (SW 1, 37).  The latter, ‘messianic’\nview of history has a distinct intention and methodology: it aims to\ngrasp how elements of what Benjamin calls “the ultimate\ncondition” and “highest metaphysical state” of\nhistory—which we might call the historical Absolute—appear\nnot as the telos or end of history, but as an immanent state\nof perfection which has the potential to manifest itself in any\nparticular moment (SW 1, 37). He claims that the necessary recognition\nof such metaphysical condition requires an act of criticism\n[Kritik] (SW 1, 38). Benjamin had initially proposed Kant’s\nphilosophy of history as the topic of his doctoral dissertation, and\nwhile he felt it necessary to change this to the Early German\nRomantics’ philosophy of art, crucial features of the proposed project\nsurvive in the final work. Astute readers, he says, may still discern\nin it an “insight into the relationship of a truth to\nhistory” (C, 135–6). Specifically, the concept of art\ncriticism operating in Romantic aesthetics rests upon epistemological\npresuppositions that reveal the ‘messianic’ essence of\nRomanticism (SW 1, 116–7; n.3, 185). The messianic conjunction\nbetween the highest metaphysical state of history and the ephemerality\nof each particular moment is here seen as theoretically determining\nthe Romantic relationship between the artistic Absolute—or what\nBenjamin defines as the Idea of art—and each particular\nartwork. In his doctoral dissertation, Benjamin argues that the philosophical\nrelationship between the Idea of art and particular artworks posited in\nRomantic aesthetics must be understood in relation to Fichte’s\ntheory of reflection. This sought to ground the possibility of a\ncertain and immediate type of cognition without recourse to the\nproblematic notion of an intellectual intuition. For Fichte, reflection\nindicates the free activity of consciousness taking itself as its own\nobject of thought: its capacity for thinking of thinking. In doing so,\nthe initial form of thinking is transformed into its content. In such\nreflection, thought seems capable of immediately grasping itself as a\nthinking subject and therefore of possessing a certain kind of\nimmediate and foundational knowledge. Although Benjamin introduces a\nnumber of specific criticisms of Fichte’s philosophical position\nin his dissertation, he nonetheless values the Fichtean concept of\nreflection for providing the epistemological foundation of Friedrich\nSchlegel’s and Novalis’ understandings of the metaphysical\nfunction of art criticism. Some scholars have, however, questioned the\naccuracy of Benjamin’s interpretation of Fichte’s concept\nof reflection and the importance he accords to it in Romantic\nepistemology (Bullock 1987, 78–93; Menninghaus 2005, 29–44).  Unlike in Fichte, here immediacy and infinitude are not mutually\nexclusive aspects of cognition. The uniqueness of the Romantic concept\nof the Absolute resides in the fact that the Romantic conception of\ninfinitude regards it not as empty but “substantial and\nfilled” (SW 1, 129). Benjamin argued that the Romantics\nspecifically identified this structure of the Absolute with the Idea of\nart, and in particular with artistic form (SW 1, 135). Art criticism\nbecomes central to this concept of infinite fulfilment because, like\nthe epistemological relation between reflection and thought in Fichte,\ncriticism both consummates the finite and particular work by raising it\nto a higher level—in which the form of the work is transformed\ninto content as the object of criticism—and simultaneously\nconnects the work’s particular artistic form with the continuity\nand unity of absolute form in the Idea of art. Criticism is, for the\nRomantics, the continuation and ongoing completion of the particular\nwork through its infinite connection with other art works and works of\ncriticism. By conceiving the Idea of art as a ‘medium of\nreflection’, the early Romantics dissolve the Enlightenment\nworld-view of the positive sciences that Fichte inherited from Kant,\nand in doing so overcome the critical injunctions placed upon the\nexperience of the infinite (SW 1, 132; 131). This conception of a\nfulfilled infinity constitutes the messianism that Benjamin claims is\nessential to Early Romantic epistemology. In the version of the dissertation formally submitted to the\nuniversity, Benjamin concludes by identifying the Romantic theory of\nart criticism with ‘the consummation of the work’ (SW 1,\n177). The artwork provides the immanent criterion for critical\nreflection, which in turn completes the work by raising it into an\nautonomous and higher existence. This immanent criticism rejects both\nthe dogmatic imposition of external rules (such as those of classical\naesthetics) and the dissolution of aesthetic criteria (with the appeal\nto artistic genius). It provides, Benjamin thought, one of the\nfundamental legacies for a modern concept of art criticism. The version\ncirculated amongst friends and colleagues does not conclude with a\ncomplete affirmation of Romanticism, however, but contains a critical\nafterword that renders explicit the critical objections that Benjamin\nhad carefully inserted into the text. These suggest that the Romantic\ntheory of art, and by implication the structure of the Absolute it is\ngrounded upon, is problematically one-sided and incomplete with regard\nto (1) its formalism, (2) its positivity, and (3) its singularity.  Since the content of each, successive,\nlevel of reflection is supplied by the form of its object, the\ncriticism unfolds the germ of immanent criticizability contained in\neach particular artwork’s form. This formalism precludes any\nserious discussion of the artwork’s specific content. Conversely, anything immanently uncriticizable cannot constitute a\ntrue work of art. As a consequence, Romantic criticism is unable to\ndifferentiate between good or bad artworks, since its only criterion\nis whether a work is or is not art. Such criticism\nis entirely positive in its evaluation, and lacks the important\nnegative moment essential to judgement. Finally, Schlegel “committed the old error of confounding\n‘abstract and ‘universal’ when he believed he had to\nmake that [Absolute] ground [of art] into an individual”,\nBenjamin claims (SW 1, 166–7). He therefore gave a “false\ninterpretation” of the unity of all works when he conceived this\nas pertaining to some mystical, singular and transcendental work. The consequent need for what Benjamin presents as a Goethean\nmodification of Early German Romanticism is laid out in the afterword.\nThe relation between these criticisms of Romanticism and Goethe’s\nthought is suggested in the claim that, “Ultimately the mystical\nthesis that art itself is one work…stands in exact correlation with\nthe principle which asserts the indestructibility of works that are\npurified in irony” (SW 1, 167). With its mistaken emphasis on the\nsingularity of the Idea of art, Romantic fulfilment only coincides with\nthe infinity of the unconditioned, meaning that fulfilment is an\nessentially non-historical category of the infinite. Such criticism\ncannot be described as judgement, since all authentic judgement\ninvolves an essential negative moment of completion in\n“self-annihilation” (SW 1, 152). Consequently, because\n‘Romantic messianism is not at work in its full force’ here\n(SW 1, 168), the Romantics were increasingly forced to turn to the\n“accoutrements” of ethics, religion and politics to provide\nthe content required to complete their theory of art.  Goethe’s conception of aesthetic judgement and his principle\nof the ‘uncriticizability’ of great works provided Benjamin\nwith a way of thinking the necessary modification to the Early German\nRomantic Idea of art. His explication of the implicit metaphysical\nstructure of Goethe’s corresponding Ideal of art reveals the\ncontrasting features of his structure of the Absolute: as a sphere of\npure content, a medium of destructive refraction,\nand a plurality of discontinuous archetypes (Charles 2020, 53–67). Because finite, particular\nworks can never be romanticized into the unity of an individual\nAbsolute, they remains immanently incomplete and yet nonetheless\nincapable of higher consummation: a “torso”, dismembered in\nrelation to the whole, corpse-like in its deadness. In this context,\nthe true task of criticism becomes not the consummation of the living\nwork, but that destructive completion of the dying one. Benjamin’s essay on ‘Goethe’s Elective\nAffinities’ (1924–5) provides an exemplary piece of\nsuch criticism, whilst developing the concept further by situating it\nmore explicitly within the context of history. Here, criticism is\ncharged with the task of revealing what Benjamin calls the\n“truth content of a work of art”, which is intimately\nbound up with its “material content” at the beginning of\nthe work’s history (SW 1, 297). In contrast to mere\ncommentary—which proceeds no further than a consideration of\nthese now historically anachronistic features of its material\ncontent—the aim of criticism is the destruction of this outer\nlayer in order for the work’s inner truth content to be grasped. The\nfundamental philological error of commentary is merely to situate the\nwork in relation to the “lived experience\n[Erlebnis]” of its author’s biographical life\n(exemplified in Friedrich Gundolf’s 1916 biography\nof Goethe), instead of the broader medium of historical\nreception through which it has passed down to the contemporary\ncritic. Benjamin’s Romantic theory of immanent criticism insists that\nthe work must contain its own inner criterion, such that the critic\nproceeds from the work itself and not from the life of the author (SW\n1, 321). Beginning, therefore, with the odd and striking features of\nGoethe’s work that come to preoccupy later critics, Benjamin examines\nhow these are derived from techniques borrowed from the distinct form\nof the novella. This novella-like construction grants the Elective\nAffinities its strange, fable-like quality, which differentiates\nit from the naturalism of a typical novel. It is this mythical layer,\nas the real material content of the work, which expresses the presence\nof a pantheistic and “daemonic” attitude toward nature in\nGoethe’s work. Truth content, in contrast, is not to be sought in the conspicuous\nfeatures of the work’s technique, but in the unity of its\ndistinct form. The task of criticism is to make this truth content an\nobject of experience. It concerns itself not with the life or\nintentions of the artist, but with that semblance or appearance of life\nthat the work itself possesses by virtue of its mimetic capacity for\nrepresentation: its linguistic expressiveness, which is described as a\nverging and bordering on life (SW 1, 350). What is essential to art,\nhowever, and what distinguishes it from the semblance of nature, is the\n“expressionless [Ausdruckslose]”:\nthat critical violence within the work of art that “arrests this\nsemblance, spellbinds the movement, and interrupts the harmony”\n(SW 1, 340). “Only the expressionless completes the work” as\na work of art, Benjamin argues, and it does so by shattering the\nwork’s semblance of unity, the false appearance of totality\npertaining to it. Unlike the intensification of Romantic reflection,\nwhen this semblance itself becomes the object of a higher-level\nsemblance, a refractive dissonance is opened up. Drawing on\nHölderlin’s concept of the caesura to describe this moment,\nBenjamin calls it a “counter-rhythmic rupture” (SW 1, 341).\nIn focusing its efforts on representing this caesura, genuine criticism\nin turn deepens the refractive violence, performing a destructive or\nmortuary act of self-annihilation upon the work. Art, at the very limit of its mimetic capacity, draws attention to\nits construction and in doing so finds the resources to encapsulate a\ndeeper truth. It is against what Benjamin calls the Christian-mystical\ncertainty in future reconciliation (which Goethe inserts into the\nconclusion of the novella as an attempt to counter the mythical\nfatalism which holds sway elsewhere) that he instead endorses the\nparadoxical glimmer of hope identified with the image of a shooting\nstar which appears in Goethe’s novella (SW 1, 354–5). If the\nimage of the star retains its relationship to the symbolic here, it\ndoes so in accordance with Benjamin’s earlier description of the\nexpressionless as “the torso of a symbol” (SW 1, 340).\nHowever, it might be better to understand the significance of the\ncaesura here in the context of the theory of allegory. This is only\nproperly formulated in Benjamin’s next major work, his thesis on\nthe Origin of the German Mourning-Play (Ursprung des\ndeutschen Trauerspiels, 1928). \n ‘Mourning-play’ (Trauerspiel)\nis a term used to characterise a type of drama that emerges during the\nbaroque period of art history in the late 16th and early 17th century.\nThe principle examples discussed in Benjamin’s thesis come not\nfrom its great exponents, Pedro Calderón de la Barca and William\nShakespeare, but the German dramatists Martin Opitz, Andreas Gryphius,\nJohann Christian Hallmann, Daniel Caspar von Lohenstein, and August\nAdolf von Haugwitz. Their plays are characterised by a simplicity of\naction which is comparable to the classicism of earlier Renaissance\ntheatre, but also contain peculiarly baroque features. These include an\nexaggerated and violent bombast in their language (including a\nfigurative tendency towards linguistic contraction), an absence of\npsychological depth in its characters, a preponderance of and\ndependency upon theatrical props and machinery, and a crude emphasis on\nviolence, suffering and death (cf. Newman 2011; Ferber 2013). Leaving aside for now the methodological introduction (referred to\nin English as the ‘Epistemo-Critical Prologue’), the first\npart of Benjamin’s thesis is concerned with repudiating the dogmatic\nattempt by later critics to impose onto these plays the external\ncriteria of Aristotelian aesthetics, which are rooted in classical\ntragedy. Benjamin’s understanding of tragedy here (and his approach to\nthe mourning-play in general) is partially influenced by Friedrich\nNietzsche’s The Birth of Tragedy. Benjamin claims\nthat The Birth of Tragedy substantiates the critical insight\nthat the empathy of undirected modern feeling is unhelpful for properly\ngrasping ancient tragedy (OGT, 93).  Instead, Nietzsche undertook a\nmetaphysical inquiry into the essence of tragedy as a dialectical\ninterplay of the contrasting aesthetic impulses of Apollonian\nsemblance and Dionysian truth. This dialectic is central to Benjamin’s\nown philosophical investigations, particularly his claim—derived\nfrom his discussion of Goethe’s Elective\nAffinities—that an expressionless moment is constitutive of\nart, in which the limits of semblance are broached precisely in order\nto illuminate an artistic truth. But Benjamin is also critical of Nietzsche for restricting his\napproach to aesthetics, and therefore renouncing the understanding of\ntragedy in historical terms. Lacking a philosophy of history,\nNietzsche’s study was unable to situate the political and ethical\nsignificance of the metaphysical and mythical features it isolates\n(OGT, 93). Influenced by ideas from Franz Rosenzweig and Florens\nChristian Rang (Asman 1992), Benjamin presents tragedy as\nexpressing a perceived break between the prehistorical age of mythical\ngods and heroes and the emergence of a new ethical and political\ncommunity. The historical limitations of Nietzsche’s theory of\ntragedy become acute when it comes to the question of the possibility\nof a recuperation of the tragic form in modern theatre. Whilst\nNietzsche tends to simply denounce the weakness of modern drama against\nthe strength of the Greeks (excepting, in his early work, the operas of\nWagner), Benjamin is concerned with establishing whether the historical\nconditions of the tragic form are themselves a limit to its\ncontemporary efficacy.  In line with the principles of Romantic criticism discussed above,\nmourning-plays contain their own distinct form and should be criticised\naccording to their own immanently discovered standards. The\n“content [Gehalt]” and “\ntrue object” of the baroque mourning-play is not, as it is in\ntragedy, myth but rather historical life (OGT, 46). As with\nGoethe’s borrowing of the novella form, this content is in part\nderived from other aesthetic structures, principally the eschatological\nfocus of mediaeval Christian literature: the Passion-Plays,\nMystery-Plays and chronicles whose historiography portrayed “the\nwhole of the course of history, world history as salvation history” (OGT,\n65). But the Lutheran renunciation of the Catholic emphasis upon good\nworks, and the secularizing tendency implicit in the naturalistic legal\nand political philosophies of the 16th and 17th century (discussed in\nrelation to Carl Schmitt’s theory of sovereignty) resulted in the\nstripping bare of human value and significance from such history. This\ntense, antinomical combination of transcendence and immanence produces\nan uneasy hybrid, in which history—as a narrative of the human\nmarch towards redemption on the Day of Judgement—loses the\neschatological certainty of its redemptive conclusion, and becomes\nsecularized into a mere natural setting for the profane struggle over\npolitical power.  Benjamin’s reflections on sovereign violence in the 17th century\nmay be contrasted with his discussion of the revolutionary kind in his\nearlier ‘Critique of Violence’ (‘Zur Kritik der\nGewalt’, 1921), itself a response to Georges\nSorel’s Reflections on Violence (1908).  These texts have\nprovoked a number of responses in the context of political theology,\nmost notably from Carl Schmitt, Jacques Derrida and Giorgio\nAgamben. Schmitt responded directly to Benjamin’s essay in Hamlet\nor Hecuba (1956). Derrida’s section on the ‘Critique of\nViolence’ in his Force of Law: The Mystical Foundation of\nAuthority (1989) interrogates this evocation of a revolutionary\nkind of divine violence, a critical engagement which continues in\nDerrida’s discussion of the messianic in Spectres of Marx\n(1994) and ‘Marx and Sons’ (1999), and in relation to\nSchmitt in The Politics of Friendship (1994). These complex\nrelations between Benjamin, Schmitt, and Derrida have become the\nsubject of a number of studies, including Agamben’s State\nof Exception (2004) (Bredekamp 1999, 247–266; Liska 2009),\nalthough more careful studies have emphasized the clear divergences\nbetween Benjamin’s position and those of Derrida and of Schmitt (Tomba\n2009, 131–132; Averlar 2005, 79–106; Weber 2008,\n176–194). In this respect, it was not Schmitt’s political\ntheology but the reactionary vitalism of Ludwig Klages that proved a\nmore influential and enduring object of fascination for Benjamin (Fuld\n1981; McCole 1993, 178–180, 236–246; Wolin 1994,\nxxxi–xxxviii; Wohlfarth 2002, 65–109; Lebovic 2013,\n1–10, 79–110; Charles 2018, 52–62).  In the second part of his thesis, Benjamin employs the concept of\nallegory to expose the implicit eschatological structure of these\nworks. However, the first part utilises the distorting tension of this\nstructure to distinguish the specific and historically conspicuous\ntechnique of the German baroque mourning-play. This concludes by\nidentifying sorrow or mourning (Trauer)\nas the predominant mood inherent to its metaphysical structure, in\ncontrast to the suffering of tragedy. With the “total \nsecularization of the historical in the state of creation…History\npasses into the setting” to become natural history (OGT, 81),\nwhose attendant cognition is a melancholic contemplation of things\nwhich derives enigmatic satisfaction from its very recognition of their\ntransience and emptiness (OGT, 141). “For all wisdom of the\nmelancholic hearkens to the deep”, Benjamin claims:\n“it is won from immersion in the life of creaturely things, and\nnothing of the voice of revelation reaches it. Everything to do with Saturn\npoints into the depths of the earth…” (OGT, 157). To grasp how the form of these works are determined by their truth\ncontent requires a reconstruction of the baroque concept of the\nallegorical which structures its mood of melancholic contemplativeness.\nBenjamin’s claim is that a genuine understanding of the\nallegorical as it emerged in its highest form in the 17th century has\nbeen obscured by, on the one hand, the later Romantic aestheticizing of\nthe symbol and, on the other, by the tendency to conceive the\nallegorical negatively in its contrast with this devalued, aesthetic\nconcept. It is only by first recovering a genuine theological concept\nof the symbol, therefore, that we are able in turn to distinguish an\nauthentic concept of the allegorical. This it to be done by reasserting\nthe profound but paradoxical theological unity between the material and\nthe transcendental found in the symbolic. The fundamental distinction\nbetween theological concepts of symbol and the allegory will then be\nseen as concerning not their differing objects (Idea vs. abstract\nconcept), but the differing ways in which they signify, express or\nrepresent this object. Benjamin will conclude that this difference is,\nspecifically, a temporal one.  Drawing on undeveloped insights found in the work of the\nmythographers Georg Friedrich Creuzer and Johann Joseph von\nGörres, Benjamin points out how “the temporal measure for the experience of the symbol[Symbolerfahrung] is the mystical instant\n[Nu]” (OGT, 173). We must understand the temporality of\nthe allegorical, in contrast, as something dynamic, mobile, and\nfluid. This authentic concept of allegory arises in the 17th century\nbaroque as a response to the antithesis between mediaeval religiosity\nand Renaissance secularization discussed earlier. The spatialization\nof the temporal structure of eschatology in the allegorical\ncorresponds to the naturalization of the religious structure of\nhistory in the baroque: “Whereas in the symbol, with the\nsublimation of downfall, the transfigured countenance of nature reveals itself \nfleetingly in the light of salvation, in allegory\nthere lies before the eyes of the observer the facies hippocratica [lit. ‘Hippocratic face’\n= the sunken, hollow and pinched features exhibited by the dying] of history\nas petrified primal\nlandscape. History, in everything untimely, sorrowful, and miscarried that belongs to it from the beginning, is inscribed in a\nface—no, in a death’s head [Totenkopfe]”\n(OGT, 174). From the perspective of the allegorical, the instantaneous\ntransformation within the symbolic becomes a natural history slowed to\nsuch an extreme that every sign appears frozen and—seemingly\nloosened from every other relationship—arbitrary. The concrete\ncorporeality of the written script exemplifies this allegorical\nemphasis upon things. Allegory is not the conventional\nrepresentation of some expression, as misunderstood by later critics,\nbut an expression of convention [Ausdruck der\nKonvention] (OGT, 185). Allegorical expression includes as its\nobject this very conventionality of the historical, this appearance of\ninsignificance and indifference. That is, convention itself comes to\nbe signified or expressed. What Benjamin rediscovers in the\nallegorical is, then, something akin to the concept of the\nexpressionless, as the torso of a symbol, introduced in the essay on\nGoethe. Benjamin argues that this predominance of the allegorical\nviewpoint in the 17th century baroque finds it most dramatic\nexpression in the mourning-play, and that consequently the Idea of the\nmourning-play must be grasped via the allegorical.  The Erkenntniskritische Vorrede\nor ‘Epistemo-Critical Prologue’ to the work may be\nunderstood as having  two central functions: it provides a direct\nmethodological justification for the theory of criticism being utilised\nin the work, by way of a problematization of existing disciplinary\napproaches, and it implicitly recovers a concept of allegorical\nexperience which is delineated  in the second part of the thesis\nin terms amenable for modernity. At the level of methodology, Benjamin\nadvocates the necessity of a transdisciplinary approach (Osborne 2011, 24) to artworks,\ncapable of critically overcoming the epistemological and historical\nlimitations of the existing disciplines of the philosophy of art and\nthe history of art (specifically, literary history). This\ntransdisciplinary aspect of Benjamin’s thesis may partially\naccount for the difficulties in its reception at the University of\nFrankfurt, where the thesis was rejected by the departments of both\nphilosophy and literature. Much of the theoretical discussion in the\nPrologue is concerned with correcting the methodological one-sidedness\nof each existing approach by way of the positive features of the other.\nIn general, the philosophy of art correctly attends to the problem of\nessences, but remains hampered by its lack of any adequate historical\nconsideration. Conversely, the history of art is preoccupied with\nhistorical lineage but has no adequate concept of essence. Yet it is\nnot simply an amalgamation of aesthetics and history that is required,\nbut their radical rethinking in accordance with first a historical\nconcept of essence and second a philosophical concept of history.   Broadly speaking, Benjamin’s theory of Ideas transposes the\nphilosophical problem of metaphysical realism into the context of\naesthetics. That is, it asks about the reality of aesthetic genres such\nas ‘tragedy’ or of artistic epochs such as the\n‘Renaissance’ that classify a group of particular works\naccording to a set of common characteristics. The Prologue criticises\nexisting traditions of aesthetic nominalism for their inadequate\nresolution of the problem. The uncritical use of inductive methods\ndemonstrated by literary historians rejects the hypostatization of\nterms such as “Renaissance” on the grounds that it promotes\na false identity between similar empirical features, which obscures\ntheir diversity. This aversion to any realism of constitutive Ideas is\ngrounded on the positivist criterion of factual verification. A term\nlike the “Renaissance” is consequently utilised by them\nonly on the proviso that it is understood as merely an abstract general\nconcept. This quickly leads to scepticism, however, since its still\nfails to address the problematic criteria by which this general concept\nis initially picked out and abstracted from the multiplicity of\nparticulars or on what grounds these particulars are grouped together.\nConsequently, it fails to appreciate the necessity of the Platonic\npostulation of Ideas for the representation of essences: whilst\nconcepts seek to make the similar identical, Ideas are necessary to\neffect a dialectical synthesis between phenomenal extremes (OGT, 18–19).\nIn contrast, philosophers of art possess a concern with the essential\nthat ends up renouncing any notion of generic forms, on the grounds\nthat the singular originality of every single work entails the only\npossible essential genre must be the universal and individual one of\nart itself. The error—as Benjamin had previously charged the\nEarly German Romantics, discussed above—is to dissolve real and\nimportant aesthetic structures or forms into an undifferentiated unity\n(of art), which denies their irreducible multiplicity (OGT, 21–23).\n The theory of Ideas presented in the Prologue is truncated and\ndifficult to understand outside the context of Benjamin’s earlier\nworks, and the philosophical tradition that it engages with is further\nobscured in the first English translation. However, the critical aspects of\nBenjamin’s investigation advocate—against aesthetic\nversions of positivist empiricism—a metaphysical realism, and,\nagainst certain versions of philosophical idealism, a non-singular\nessentialism. That is, he does not restrict the possibility of\nmetaphysical reality only to actual empirical particulars and he\nadvocates the multiplicity and not singularity of the essence\n(understood, in Goethean terms, as a harmony and not a unity of truth).\nIn doing so, he must address that  ‘theological’\nparadox, mentioned in the discussion of symbol and allegory, of how the\ntranscendental/supersensuous appears immanently within the\nmaterial/sensuous. Benjamin is clear that the relation between Ideas\nand phenomenon is neither one of Aristotelian ‘containment’\nnor one of Kantian lawfulness or hypothesis. Ideas are not given to\nsome intellectual intuition, but they are capable of being sensuously\nrepresented. Such a sensuous representation of the truth remains the\ntask of philosophy. Benjamin’s theoretical elaboration proceeds by startling imagistic\nreconfigurations of pre-existing elements within the philosophical\ntradition. He offers a number of possibilities for thinking such Ideas\nin the Prologue, taken from the realm not only of philosophy but of\naesthetics, theology and science. The first is the Platonic Idea, here\ndivorced from its association with the scientific ascent to some\npurely rational, objective knowledge (such as appears in the account\nof dialectic in the Republic) and instead linked to the\ndiscussion of beautiful semblance in the Symposium (OGT,\n6). The second is that of the Adamic Name, as developed in his\nearlier theory of language. In this context, he comments that the\nEarly German Romantics were frustrated in their attempt to renew the\ntheory of Ideas because truth took on the character of reflective\nconsciousness for them, rather than that intentionless, linguistic\ncharacter in which things were subsumed under essential Names by\nAdam’s primal-interrogation [urvernehmen] (OGT, 15). Naming\nis the primal history [Urgeschicte] of signifying, indicating\na thing-like disinterest which contrasts with the directed, unifying\nintentionality of Husserlian phenomenology (OGT, 14). The third is\nthe Goethean Ideal, which is recalled here in the context of the\nFaustian “Mothers” and which implicitly gestures towards\nhis earlier discussions of Goethe (OGT, 11). Finally, and most famously,\nBenjamin compares the virtual objectivity of the Idea represented\nthrough the reconfiguring of actual phenomena to an astrological\nconstellation, which simultaneously groups together and is revealed by\nthe cluster of individual stars (OGT, 11). Truth is said to be “actualized in the round dance of presented Ideas [vergegenwärtigt\nim Reigen der dargestellen Ideen]” (OGT, 4). This concept of the constellation is taken up\ndirectly in Adorno’s inaugural lecture ‘The Actuality of\nPhilosophy’, where he speaks of ‘the manipulation of\nconceptual material by philosophy…of grouping and trial\narrangement, of constellation and construction’ (Adorno 1931,\n131). It comes to inform Benjamin’s philosophical practice in his\nmajor writings from this point onwards, from One-Way Street\n(1928), via the methodological demand for the construction of history\nand the attendant theory of the dialectical image in his work related\nto the “Arcades Project” in the 1930s, through to the\nconcept of history presented in his celebrated late essay, ‘On\nthe Concept of History’ (1940).  Benjamin’s concern to reincorporate the perspective of\nart’s temporal transformation demands an analogous\nradicalization. The “genetic and concrete classification”\n(OGT, 24) that Benedetto Croce called history (in order to distinguish\nit from that generalizing thought that abstracts away from change and\ndevelopment) must now be reconciled with Benjamin’s theory of\nIdeas. For the messianic philosophy of history that grounds\nBenjamin’s work problematizes existing formulations of the\nconcepts of history and historical origin. In line with his discussion\nof the Idea, the concept of historical origin should not be reduced to\nthe causality and actuality of the empirically factual, nor should it\nbe regarded as a purely logical and timeless essence. It is not\nmerely, Benjamin argues, “the coming-to-be of what has originated ” and cannot be recognized in “the naked, manifest existence of the factual” (OGT, 24). For the\n‘historical’ sequence that permits the Idea to be\nrepresented must include not only that of the actual phenomena of a\ngiven period, but also that of their subsequent development in the\nunderstanding of later epochs. An investigation of the essence of the\nGerman mourning-play, for example, cannot restrict itself to\ncontemporaneous events and actual plays as if these were\n‘facts’ settled and decided once and for all, but must\nalso investigate the changing understanding of this historical epoch\nand the varying reception of these plays, including the prior\nconditions of its own self-understanding. But nor is it a\n“purely logical” category, as if the Idea were some\nessence detached from and unrelated to history, to be grasped through\nan abstraction from all these particular historical developments (OGT,\n25). Origin [Ursprung] is therefore distinguished from a\nmerely genetic coming-into-being [Enstehung] and evolutionary\ndevelopment of ‘pure history’, to include the essential\ninner history of the “life of the works and forms” (OGT,\n24–6). The “science of the Origin” is a philosophical\nhistory, a history of the essential, whose contemplation enlists a\ndialectical perspective to grasp the form of the “original\nphenomenon”: as something subject to a process of becoming and\ndisappearing, and therefore only partial and incomplete.  Benjamin\nonce again resorts to an image: “The origin stands as eddy in the\nstream of becoming and vigorously draws the emerging material into its\nrhythm” (OGT, 24). Criticism\nattempts to virtually reassemble the fore- and after-history [Vor-\nund Nachgeschichte] of the phenomena into a historical\nconstellation, in which the Idea is represented and the phenomena\nredeemed. This is its messianic function in relation to the historical\nAbsolute.  The Prologue also seeks to rescue the allegorical experience\nrecognised in the mourning-plays for a modern theory of criticism.\nAllegorical contemplation aims at the ruination of things so that it\ncan, in its redemptive moment, construct [baun]\na new whole out of the elements of the old. The character of this\nconstruction distinguishes it from the creative invention of fantasy,\nsince it manipulates and rearranges pre-existing material. To leave an\nimprint or impression of this construction [Konstruktion]\nis one of its aims. This dual emphasis upon destruction and\nconstruction has led a number of scholars to see an anticipation of\nDerridean deconstruction in Benjamin’s work (Fischer 1996,\nSection 1: Modernity/Postmodernity; Weber 2008, 122–128), although it\nshould be noted that his consideration of the specific historicity of\nthis concept of criticism and his insistence of the immanent truth\ncontent of artworks remains resolutely modernist, and cannot be easily\nassimilated into any ‘postmodernist’ position (cf. Weigel\n1996, xiv). The underlying affinity between romanticism and the baroque\nlies in their shared modernist concern with correcting classicism in\nart and the quasi-mythical perspective of classicism in general (OGT,\n230; 185). The Prologue reflects upon this ‘modernity’ of\nthe baroque when it notes how the “Striking analogies to the current state of German literature have repeatedly given rise to …immersion in the Baroque” (OGT, 36). Although Benjamin is\nciting the similarities between Expressionism in modern literature and\nthe Mannerist exaggeration of the baroque, his own reconstruction of\nallegorical experience and its value for aesthetic theory is\nexperienced according to a historical conjunction between the baroque\npast and the modernity of Benjamin’s present: modernity both\nreveals and is revealed in the baroque.  The book on mourning-plays concluded Benjamin’s German “cycle\nof production” (C, 322). At the beginning of the 1920s\nBenjamin became immersed in what was planned as a large-scale study of\npolitical thought, of which only a few fragments and the ‘Critique of\nViolence’ remain (Steiner 2001, 61). As Uwe Steiner notes, while\nBenjamin’s political thought may be situated in the milieu of\nExpressionist Nietzsche-reception, the centrality that the realization\nof happiness occupies in his definition of politics as “the\nsatisfaction of unenhanced humanness” is constructed in direct\nopposition to Zarathustra’s tragic heroism (Steiner 2001, 49–50,\n61–62). This marks both a continuity with and a break from what Irving\nWohlfarth has called his earlier “politics of Youth” (Wohlfarth 1992,\n164), which drew heavily on a philosophy of history and culture\ninfluenced by Nietzsche’s Untimely Meditations. Benjamin\nremarked that his break from the Youth Movement did not constitute the\nabandonment of this earlier thought, however, but its submergence into\na ‘harder, purer, more invisible radicalism’ (C, 74). This in part\naccounts for what T. J. Clark describes as the “cryptic” character of\n- what Adorno termed (SW 4, 101-2) - the anthropological materialism\nof The Arcades Project, where, Clark comments, it is “as if\nsuch a politics were being actively aired and developed elsewhere”\n(Clark 2003, 45–46). \nA new cycle was initiated with One-Way Street\n(Einbahnstraße), written 1923–6, published 1928),\nwhose form and content puts into practice that speculative concept of\nexperience, with its allegorical immersion into the depths of things,\nwhich was theoretically articulated in the works considered above. The\ncity furnishes the sensuous, imagistic material for One-Way\nStreet, whilst the genres of the leaflet, placard and\nadvertisement provide the constructive principle by which it is\nrearranged as a constellation.  This formal methodology resembles the\ntechnological media of photography and film, as well as the\navant-garde practices of Russian Constructivism and French\nSurrealism. This entails what Adorno describes as a “philosophy\ndirected against philosophy” (Adorno 1955, 235) or what Howard\nCaygill calls a “philosophizing beyond philosophy”\n(Caygill 1989, 119). The presentation of contemporary capitalism as metropolitan\nmodernity in One-Way Street also marks the turning point in\nBenjamin’s writings, away from what he retrospectively called\n“an archaic form of philosophizing naively caught up in\nnature” (BA, 88) towards the development of “a political\nview of the past” (SW 2, 210). The theory of experience outlined\nin his early writings is enlisted for revolutionary ends. In the\nessay, ‘Surrealism: The Last Snapshot of the European\nIntelligentsia’ (1929), Surrealist experience provides an\nexample of a “profane illumination”, which in contrast to\nthe sacred and moralistic kind found in religion was guided by a\npolitical and a “materialistic, anthropological\ninspiration” (SW 2, 209). The latent energy residing in the most\ndestitute and outmoded of things is, through the construction of new\npolitical constellations, transformed into an intoxicating,\nrevolutionary experience (SW 2, 210). The possibility of such a\nprofane illumination of nineteenth century Paris, to be presented as\nthe origin of modernity, preoccupied the remaining decade of\nBenjamin’s life, and his research for the monumental and unfinished\n“Arcades Project” provides the material from which all his\nremaining work is constructed.\n The city was the seedbed of Benjamin’s ‘gothic’ Marxism\n(Cohen 1993); Paris its testing ground. All of Benjamin’s writings\nfrom the autumn of 1927 until his death in 1940 relate in one way or\nother to his great unfinished study ‘Paris—Capital of the\nNineteenth Century’, otherwise known as The Arcades\nProject (Das Passagen-Werk), after its founding image,\ntaken by Benjamin from the 1926 novel, Le Paysan de Paris, by\nthe French surrealist Louis Aragon. This was a book of which Benjamin\nwrote: “I could never read more than two or three pages in bed\nat night before my heart started to beat so strongly that I had to lay\nthe book aside.” (BA, 88) The arcades would become just one of\nfive or six archetypal images of the psychosocial space of\n19th-century Paris around which the project was organized—each\npaired with a particular, thematically representative individual. But\nit provided the model for the others, and its surrealist origin and\nliminal utopian impulse, neither quite inside nor out, established the\nwish-image and the dream-image—on the threshold of sleeping and\nwaking—at the heart of a work that was initially conceived as a\nkind of ‘dialectical fairytale’. (The figure with whom\n‘the arcades’ was paired was the utopian socialist Charles\nFourier.) All of Benjamin’s major essays of the 1930s derived their\nimpetus and orientation from his Arcades work, and served to defer its\ncompletion in the act of elaborating its elements.  This deferral was also, in part, the result of a process of\nmaturation—a kind of ripening—immanent to the work\nitself. The Arcades was a vast and ambitious project, not\nsimply in terms of the mass and breadth of its archival sources\n(sought out by Benjamin in the Bibliothèque Nationale in\nParis), but also—indeed, primarily—with respect to its\nphilosophical and historical intent, and the methodological and\nrepresentational challenges it posed. Its sprawling, yet minutely\ninvestigated historical object was to act as the point of entry into\nthe philosophically comprehended experience of metropolitan\ncapitalism—not some past experience, or the experience of a past\nphase of capitalist development, but the experience of the capitalist\nmetropolis in Benjamin’s own day—through the construction of a\nspecific series of relations between its elements ‘then’\nand ‘now’. The practice of research, conceptual\norganization and presentation that it involved was self-consciously\nconceived as a working model for a new, philosophically oriented,\nmaterialist historiography with political intent. Its final,\nfragmentary and ‘ruined’ status has come to stand not\nsimply as the sign of a failure of completion, but as a paradigm of a\nform of constitutive incompletion that is characteristic of all\nsystematically oriented knowledge under the conditions of\nmodernity. In this respect, in its very failure to be actualized, it\nconfirmed the fundamental historical and philosophical truth of\nBenjamin’s earlier analysis of the Romantic fragment—extending\nthe genre in a hitherto unimagined way. In the ebb and flow of its changing rhythms—additions,\nrevisions, reformulations and retrievals—Benjamin’s Arcades\nProject provides an extraordinary case study in the labour of\nconceptual construction via the configuration and reconfiguration of\narchival materials. The voluminous ‘Notes and Materials’\nthat make up the Arcades as it has come down to us remained\nunpublished until 1982, finally appearing in English only in 1999 (GS\nV; AP). Only since their publication has it been possible to get a\nclear sense of the overall trajectory of Benjamin’s thought during\nthis period—rendering redundant, or at least displacing, many of\nthe polemics associated with previous cycles of reception. The notes\nand materials are organized into twenty-six alphabetically designated\n‘convolutes’ (literally ‘bundles’) or folders,\nthematically defined by various objects (arcades, catacombs,\nbarricades, iron constructions, mirrors, modes of\nlighting…), topics (fashion, boredom, theory of\nknowledge, theory of progress, painting,\nconspiracies…), figures (the collector, the flaneur,\nthe automaton…), authors (Baudelaire, Fourier, Jung,\nMarx, Saint-Simon…) and their combinations. The project as a\nwhole received two ‘exposés’ or summaries, in 1935\nand 1939 (the second, in French). However, its scope and theoretical\nambition—nothing less than a philosophical construction of\n“the primal history of the nineteenth century” (BA,\n90)—joined with the circumstances of Benjamin’s life in exile\n(the constant need to earn money by writing and the uncertainty of a\npublisher for the project) to frustrate its realization. The only\nlengthy segment of completed text derives from the part devoted to\nBaudelaire (one of five parts in the 1939 exposé, cut down from\nsix in the initial 1935 version): the second of its three projected\nsections, ‘The Paris of the Second Empire in\nBaudelaire’—although even this was never published in\nBenjamin’s lifetime. However, the central chapter of this section,\n‘The Flaneur’, was revised and expanded (in part, in\nresponse to an exchange of letters with Adorno) into the essay\n‘Some Motifs in Baudelaire’, which was published in the\nInstitute’s journal, Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung\n(Journal for Social Research) in January 1940. A powerful\ncompressed draft of material corresponding to the final section, on\nthe commodity as a poetic object, exists as ‘Central Park’\n(SW 4, 161–199). As the project evolved, and in response to the\nbarriers to its realization, Baudelaire thus became increasingly\ncentral to Benjamin’s thinking.  (‘Convolute J’, on\nBaudelaire, is by far the longest of the convolutes.) Encouraged by\nHorkheimer, Benjamin planned to publish the material on Baudelaire as\na separate book, to be entitled, Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet\nin the Era of High Capitalism.  The development of this process,\nwhereby a primal history of the nineteenth century gradually morphed\ninto a book on Baudelaire and ‘high capitalism’, may be\nrepresented, diagrammatically, as follows. \n\nHowever, to reduce the project to its own, restricted de facto\ntrajectory, rich as it is, does too much violence to the historical and\nphilosophical framework it embodies, from which the material on\nBaudelaire gains its broader significance. The overarching historical\nframework is that of capitalist modernity as a ‘crisis of\nexperience’. (The two terms, capitalism and modernity, are\ninextricable for Benjamin in the context of 19th- and early\n20th-century Europe.) The founding problematic of Benjamin’s\nthought—the expansion of the Kantian concept of experience, to\ninfinity—is thus here provided with a concretely historical\ncontext, in which the notion of infinity/absoluteness becomes\nassociated with the concept of history itself. The problem: to\ndialectically redeem the concept of experience [Erfahrung]\nby finding an appropriate way of experiencing the crisis of experience\nitself. In classically ‘modern’ terms, the present is\ndefined as a time of crisis and transition, and philosophical\nexperience (truth) is associated with the glimpse within the present,\nvia the past, of a utopian political future that would bring history to\nan end. More immediately, the crisis is given political meaning by two\npossible resolutions: the one destructive; the other constructive/\nemancipatory—fascism and communism, respectively. In this\nrespect, for all his theoretical heterodoxy as a ‘Marxist’\nand his philosophical affinities with Adorno, Benjamin was in search\nof, and in solidarity with, new forms of collectivity connected to a\ncommunist future. Herein lay the basis of his friendship with Brecht.\nUnlike Brecht, however, he conceived them within the terms of a\nspeculative cultural history (Caygill 2004).  Within this framework, three distinct strands of work (discussed in\nthe next three sections) can be discerned: (1) investigation of the\ncrisis of experience via the ‘crisis of the arts’\n(SW  2, 212) through the interrelated terms\nof technology/technique\n[Technik], aura, reproducibility,\nand collectivity; (2) philosophical distillation of the\nformal structure of the experience of the new, and its historical and\npolitical contradictions, out of its social forms, and the examination\nof its relations to allegory and commodity-form; (3) construction of a\nnew historiography and a new philosophical concept of history. The\nfirst may be traced through a linked series of essays of which\n‘Surrealism: The Last Snapshot of the European\nIntelligentsia’ (1929), ‘Little History of\nPhotography’ (1931), ‘The Work of Art in the Age of its\nTechnical Reproducibility’ (1935–9) and ‘The\nStoryteller’ (1936) are the most important. The second is\nconcentrated in readings of Baudelaire and related texts by Nietzsche\nand Blanqui. (The focusing-in on these three thinkers is a focusing-in\non the relationship of capitalism to modernity in its purest,\nnihilistic form). The third is conjured from a reflective conjunction\nof Marx, Nietzsche and Surrealism. It takes methodological form in\n‘Convolute N [On the Theory of Knowledge, Theory of\nProgress]’ in The Arcades Project and achieved its\naccidentally definitive presentation in Benjamin’s most frequently\ncited, but still fiercely interpretatively disputed text (Caygill\n2004; Löwy 2005; Tiedemman 1989; Wohlfarth 1978): the\nfragments—known as theses—‘On the Concept of\nHistory’. That Benjamin approached the symptomatic significance of the\n‘crisis of the arts’ for the ‘crisis of\nexperience’ through the concept of Technik attests to\nthe fundamentally Marxist character of his conception of historical\ndevelopment. It is the development of the forces of production that is\nthe motor of history. However, Benjamin was no more orthodox a Marxist\nabout technology than he was with regard to the concept of progress,\nthe Marxist version of which the German Social Democratic Party (SPD)\ngrounded upon it (see Section 8, below). Not only did he recognize the\npotential for a “bloodbath” in a technology subjected to\n“the lust for profit” (SW  1, 487)—amply\ndemonstrated in the horrors of the First World War—but he came\nto distinguish between a ‘first’ and a\n‘second’, potentially liberatory technology, the latter\nmaking possible “a highly productive use of the human being’s\nself-alienation” (SW 3, 107; 113). It appears, in places, as the\nbasis for a kind of ‘technological cosmopolitics’ or\npolitics of a ‘new collective technoid body’ (Caygill\n2005, 225; Leslie 2000, 153, in Osborne 2005, II: 391). \nThe mastery of nature, so the imperialists teach, is the purpose of\nall technology [Technik]. But …technology is not the\nmastery of nature but of the relation between nature and\nhumanity. …In technology a physis is being organized\nthrough which mankind’s contact with the cosmos takes a new and\ndifferent form from that which it had in nations\n[Völkern] and families. (SW 1, 487, translation\namended) The collective is a body, too. And the physis that is\nbeing organized for it in technology can, through all its political\nand factual reality, only be produced in that image sphere to which\nprofane illumination initiates us. Only when in technology body and\nimage so interpenetrate that all revolutionary tension becomes bodily\ncollective innervation, and all the bodily innervations of the\ncollective become revolutionary discharge, has reality transcended\nitself to the extent demanded by the Communist Manifesto. (SW\n2, 217–8) These passages, from the concluding sections of One-Way Street\nand the ‘Surrealism’ essay, respectively, convey something\nof the ecstatic character of Benjamin’s political thought at the\noutset of the 1930s, in which technology appears on a political\nknife-edge between its possibilities as “a fetish of doom”\nand “a key to happiness” (SW 2, 321). Art—an art of\nthe masses—appears within this scenario as the educative\nmechanism through which the body of the collective can begin to\nappropriate its own technological potential. In his footnote to this passage from the second version of\n‘The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical\nReproducibility’ (‘Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner\ntechnischen Reproduzierbarkeit’, 1936), Benjamin refers us\nto the ‘phalansteries’, the “self-contained agrarian\ncollectives” of Fourier’s socialist utopia. In the Fourier\nconvolute of the Arcades Project, these are compared to the\ntwo main articles of Benjamin’s politics: “the idea of\nrevolution as an innervation of the technical organs of the\ncollective… and the idea of the ‘cracking open of natural\nteleology’” (AP, [W7, 4], 631). For Benjamin, art, in the\nform of film—the “unfolding <result> of all the\nforms of perception, the tempos and rhythms, which lie preformed in\ntoday’s machines”—thus harboured the possibility of\nbecoming a kind of rehearsal of the revolution. “[A]ll problems\nof contemporary art”, Benjamin insisted, “find their\ndefinitive formulation only in the context of film” (AP, [K3,\n3], 394). In this respect, it was the combination of the communist\npedagogy and constructive devices of Brecht’s epic theatre that marked\nit out for him as a theatre for the age of film (UB, 1–25;\nWizisla 2009). Benjamin’s writings on film are justly renowned for their twin\ntheses of the transformation of the concept of art by its\n‘technical reproducibility’ and the new possibilities for\ncollective experience this contains, in the wake of the historical\ndecline of the ‘aura’ of the work of art, a process that\nfilm is presented as definitively concluding. Much ink has been spilt\ndebating the thesis of the decline of the aura in Benjamin’s\nwork. On the one hand, with regard to some of his writings,\nBenjamin’s concept of aura has been accused of fostering a\nnostalgic, purely negative sense of modernity as loss—loss of\nunity both with nature and in community (A. Benjamin 1989). On the\nother hand, in the work on film, Benjamin appears to adopt an\naffirmative technological modernism, which celebrates the consequences\nof the decline. Adorno, for one, felt betrayed by the latter position.\nHe wrote to Benjamin on 18 March 1936: Brecht himself, meanwhile, was appalled by even the residually\nnegative function of the aura, recording his response in\nhis Workbook: “it is all mysticism mysticism, in a\nposture opposed to mysticism. … it is rather ghastly”\n(cited in Buck-Morss 1977, 149). Yet Adorno did not defend\n‘auratic art’ as such. (His defence of autonomous art was\ngrounded on the experience derived from following the\n‘autonomous’ technical development of laws of form.) Clearly, the concept of the aura plays a number of different roles\nin Benjamin’s writings, in his various attempts to grasp his\nhistorical present in terms of the possibilities for\n‘experience’ afforded by its new cultural forms; which he\nincreasingly came to identify (some say precipitously) with\nrevolutionary political potential. Yet Adorno was wrong to see a simple\nchange of position, rather than a complex series of inflections of what\nwas a generally consistent historical account. Benjamin had written\naffirmatively of “the emancipation of object from aura” as\nearly as 1931, in his ‘Little History of Photography’, in\nwhich he described Atget’s photographs as “suck[ing] the\naura out of reality like water from a sinking ship” (SW 2, 518).\nIt is here that we find the basic definition of aura: “A strange\nweave of space and time: the unique appearance or semblance of\ndistance, no matter how close it may be.” Importantly, the\nexamples given with this definition are from nature: mountains and a\nbranch observed “at rest on a summer’s noon … until\nthe moment or the hour become part of their appearance…”.\nThe ‘destruction’ of the aura by transience and\nreproducibility is judged “a salutary estrangement” (SW 2,\n518–9). Similarly, when ‘The Storyteller’ recounts\nthe “dying out of the art of storytelling” and “the\nincomparable aura that surrounds the storyteller”, it is\nnonetheless maintained: “nothing could be more fatuous than to\nwish to see it as merely a ‘symptom of decay’, let alone a\n‘modern symptom’. It is rather, only a concomitant of the\nsecular productive forces of history…” (SW 3, 146; 162).\n‘The Work of Art’ essay extends and enriches the earlier\naccount of photography’s technological transformation of\nperception (“the optical unconscious”) with reference to\nfilm. The difference resides in the insistent political dimension of\nthe later essay (after Hitler’s taking of power in 1933), and its\ndetermination to introduce concepts “that are completely useless\nfor the purposes of fascism” (SW 3, 102). The main problem with\nthe auratic (which is deemed historically residual, not eliminated,\nindeed is perhaps ineliminable [Didi-Huberman 2004]) was that, Benjamin\nbelieved, it was precisely “useful for fascism”. This\ncontext over-determines the essay throughout, with its almost Manichean\noppositions between ritual and politics, cult value and exhibition\nvalue. Quite apart from the intervening technological and social\ndevelopments, it makes it a very difficult text simply to\n‘use’ today. For some, however, it is precisely the\nconnection it draws between a certain kind of mass culture and fascism\nthat provides its continuing relevance (Buck-Morss 1992). \nBenjamin’s thinking of ‘the modern’ [die Moderne]\nis his most important theoretical contribution to the historical study\nof cultural forms. Frequently mistranslated in early English-language\neditions of his writings as ‘modernism’, and still often\nrendered as ‘modernity’ (although Benjamin tended to\nretain Baudelaire’s coinage, la modernité, when making\nthat reference), die Moderne designates both a formal\ntemporal structure and the diverse range of its historical\ninstances—past and present. Baudelaire is the main writer\nthrough whom Benjamin thought ‘the modern’; not as might\nbe expected, with reference to the canonical account\nof modernité in ‘The Painter of Modern\nLife’ (1859/60), but with regard to what Benjamin called the\n‘theory’ of the modern first set down in ‘The Salon\nof 1845’: “the advent of the true new (die Heraufkunft\ndes wahrhaft Neunen)” (SW 4, 45–6, translation\namended; GS 1.2, 580).  In Baudelaire’s ‘The Painter’ essay, modernité\nfamously denotes ‘the ephemeral, the fugitive, the\ncontingent’. It is associated with transitoriness as the\ngeneralized social instantiation of the temporality of the modern, in\nthe capitalist metropolis. In contrast to transitoriness as such,\nhowever, Benjamin was first and foremost (politically and\nphilosophically) interested in ‘the new’, in its\n‘advent’ or historical becoming, and in its quality as\nnewness or novelty (the newness of the new), in a way that was\nconceptually distinct from the conventional opposition of the\n‘modern’ to the ‘ancient’—which\nBaudelaire notoriously retained. As a result, Benjamin was consequently\nalso interested in what the German sociologist Max Weber would have\ncalled its ‘routinization’ (although Benjamin did not use\nthis vocabulary): the routinization accompanying the generalization of\nthe new as a mode of experience—in fashion and boredom, in\nparticular—and the formal structure of sameness involved in its\nrepetition. It is here that transitoriness enters the picture—as \na result of the generalization of novelty. Baudelaire\nself-consciously embraced modernity with ‘heroic effort’,\nattempting, like the painter of modern life, to ‘extract its epic\naspects’ and ‘distill the eternal from the\ntransitory’; Benjamin, on the other hand, sought to understand it\nin order to find a way out of what he called its ‘hell’. He\npicked up on the relationship of the transitory to the eternal in\nBaudelaire’s account of modernity, but first, he de-classicized\nthe notion of the ‘eternal’, refiguring it philosophically,\nand second, he rendered the relationship itself strictly dialectical:\nin the modern, it is transitoriness itself that is eternalized. Thus, Benjamin did not so much take over and update Baudelaire’s\nportrayal of modernity as read it ‘symptomatically’ (in\nLouis Althusser’s sense), or more precisely, allegorically, in order\nto uncover beneath it the experience of the transformation of\nhistorical time by the commodity form.  Baudelaire was able to\ngrasp this experience, according to Benjamin, through the\ncontradictory historical temporality that structured his work: at once\nresolutely modern yet, in its poetic form (lyric), already\nanachronistic. Benjamin similarly valued the disjunctive historical\ntemporality of Kafka’s fables: their status as parables after the\n‘end of storytelling’. But whereas Kafka was for Benjamin\n“the figure of a failure” (BS, 226)—the inevitable\nfailure of an attempt to translate the experience [Erlebnis]\nof modernity into the language of tradition\n(Judaism)—Baudelaire’s poetry was able to convey the intensity\nof the experience of modernity through the very tension between that\nexperience and his chosen, lyrical means; not merely negatively (like\nKafka), but via the way in which modernity transformed those means. In\nparticular, the lyric allowed Baudelaire to register the full effect\nof the temporality of the modern on the dissolution of subjectivity,\nand the fact that it consequently “takes a heroic constitution\nto live the modern [die Moderne]” (SW 4, 44,\ntranslation amended; GS 1.2, 577). The extraction of the metropolitan\n‘motifs’ for which Benjamin’s reading of Baudelaire is\njustly famous—the bohemian, the flaneur, the prostitute, the\ngambler, the ragpicker—are the figures via which this structure\nof experience appears. Primary within Baudelaire, they are nonetheless\nmethodologically secondary for Benjamin, as he explained to Adorno:\n“I only have to insert [them] in the appropriate place”\n(BA, 90). Baudelaire had found a method—what he called\n‘correspondences’—which reflectively incorporated\nthe anachronism of the lyric form into his work. Benjamin appropriated\nthis method, with its dissociated ‘ritual elements’ (SW 4,\n333), to read Baudelaire himself.  In the essay ‘Some Motifs in\nBaudelaire’, correspondences of temporal structure, experienced\nas ‘shock’, link the machine, the film, the crowd, and the\ngame of chance:  \nWhat determines the rhythm of production on a conveyor\nbelt is the same thing that underlies the rhythm of reception in the\nfilm. … The shock experience [Chockerlebnis] which the\npasser-by has in the crowd corresponds to the isolated\n‘experiences’ of the worker at his machine. … The\njolt in the movement of a machine is like the so-called coup in a game\nof chance…. (SW 4, 328–30) A single repetitive and dissociated formal temporal structure is\ndetected beneath the rich array of phenomenological forms presented in\nBaudelaire’s poetry: “the price for which the sensation of\nthe modern could be had: the disintegration of the aura in shock\nexperience”. (SW 4, 343, translation amended; GS 1.2, 653)  Furthermore, this interpretative key, the experience of shock, is\nitself understood through a series of theoretical correspondences\nwithin Benjamin’s own present; primarily, that between\nProust’s ‘involuntary memory’ and Freud’s\ntheory of consciousness. This theoretical correspondence is read in the\nlight of the ‘shell shock’ first diagnosed during the First\nWorld War, about which Benjamin had previously written in his\nreflections on Ernst Junger in his 1930 review essay, ‘Theories\nof German Fascism’ (SW 2, 312–321). The connection of the\nmodern to fascism does not appear solely through the thematic of the\nfalse restoration of the aura, but also within the process of its\ndisintegration by shock. (Structurally, the shock of the crowd is\n‘like’ shell shock.) Baudelaire is thus not merely the\nprivileged writer for the advent of the theory of the modern, but the\none in whose work the nineteenth century appears most clearly as the\nfore-life of the present. However, if it was through Baudelaire that\nBenjamin grasped the structure of the temporality of the\n‘modern’, it was through Nietzsche and Blanqui that he\nexplored its ambiguous historical meaning, via the way in which their\nphilosophies reflect the transformation of the new by the commodity\ninto the ‘ever selfsame’. “Just as in the seventeenth\ncentury it is allegory that becomes the canon of dialectical images, in\nthe nineteenth century it is novelty” (AP, 11):  “The\ncommodity has taken the place of the allegorical mode of\napprehension.” (SW 4, 188)  It is the fragment ‘Central Park’ that most clearly\nreveals the consequences of Benjamin’s reading of Baudelaire for his\nconcept of history: the modern completely transforms the possibilities\nfor the experience of history. On the one hand, it de-historicizes\nexperience, wresting it away from the temporal continuities of\ntradition. On the other hand, a messianic structure—an opening\nof history to something outside of time—reasserts itself within\nthe still life [nature mort] of modernity’s restless\nsameness. This is Benjamin’s famous ‘dialectics at a\nstandstill’ (Tiedemann, 1982). It transforms the historical\nnaturalism of the baroque, analyzed in the Origin of the German\nMourning-Play (Section 4, above), in a futural direction. In\nparticular, it involves a prioritization of the interruptive stasis of\nthe image over the continuity of temporal succession. In fact,\nBenjamin maintained: “The concept of historical time forms an\nantithesis to the idea of a temporal continuum” (SW 4, 407).]\n  Debate over Benjamin’s conception of history was for many years\npreoccupied with the question of whether it is essentially\n‘theological’ or ‘materialist’ in character\n(or how it could possibly be both at once), occasioned by the\nconjunction of Benjamin’s self-identification with historical\nmaterialism and his continued use of explicitly messianic motifs\n(Wolhfarth 1978; Tiedemann 1983–4). This was in large part the\npolemical legacy of the competing influence of three\nfriendships—with Gershom Scholem, Theodor W. Adorno and Bertolt\nBrecht—applied to the interpretation of Benjamin’s final text,\nthe fragments ‘On the Concept of History’\n(‘Über den Begriff der Geschichte’,\npopularly known as the ‘Theses on the Philosophy of\nHistory’). Scholem promoted a theological interpretation, Brecht\ninspired a materialist one, while Adorno attempted to forge some form\nof compatibility between the two. Yet the question is badly posed if\nit is framed within received concepts of ‘theology’ and\n‘materialism’ (the paradox becomes self-sustaining), since\nit was Benjamin’s aim radically to rethink the meaning of these ideas,\non the basis of a new philosophy of historical time. This new\nphilosophy of historical time is the ultimate goal of Benjamin’s later\nwritings. It appears most explicitly, under construction, in\n‘Convolute N’ of The Arcades Project, ‘On\nthe Theory of Knowledge, Theory of Progress’; it is applied to\nart history in the 1937 essay ‘Eduard Fuch, Collector and\nHistorian’; and is manifest in a condensed, rhetorically\npolitical and problematic form in ‘On the Concept of\nHistory’. It derives from a dual critique of the ‘vulgar\nnaturalism’ of historicism and the deferral of action\ninvolved in the associated Social Democratic concept\nof progress (Kittsteiner 1986).  It gives rise to a\nconception of historical intelligibility based on ‘literary\nmontage’ as the method of construction of ‘dialectical\nimages’ (AP, 460–1). And it culminates in a\nquasi-messianic conception of revolution as an\n‘interruption’ of history or an ‘arrest of\nhappening’: “Classless society is not the final goal of\nhistorical progress but its frequently miscarried, ultimately achieved\ninterruption” (SW 4, 402). Benjamin took as one of the main ‘methodological\nobjectives’ of his Arcades Project “to\ndemonstrate a historical materialism which has annihilated within\nitself the idea of progress”, taking as its “founding\nconcept… not progress but actualization”  (AP, [N2,\n2], 460). He had both philosophical and political reasons for\nthis. Philosophically, Benjamin saw the conventional idea of progress\nas projecting into the future a conception of time as\n‘homogenous’ and ‘empty’ epitomized by the\nattempt of Ranke’s historicism to represent the past “the way it\nreally was” (SW4, 395; 391). This is a conception of time based\non the temporal continuity of past, present and future,\n‘in’ which events occur and are understood as causally\nconnected. It is naturalistic in so far as it acknowledges no\nfundamental temporal-ontological distinction between past, present and\nfuture time; it has no sense of time as the ongoing production of\ntemporal differentiation. Time is differentiated solely by the\ndifferences between the events that occur within it. In particular, it\nfails to grasp that historical time (the time of human life) is\nconstituted through such immanent differentiations, via the\nexistential modes of memory, expectation and action. In this respect,\nthere are affinities between Benjamin’s philosophy of time and\nHeidegger’s (Caygill, 1994).  The political consequence of the temporal naturalism underlying the\nidea of ‘progress’ is conformism. For Benjamin,\nparadoxically, this applied in particular to the German Social\nDemocrats’ understanding of communism as an ideal, in the\nneo-Kantian ethical sense of the object of an ‘endless\ntask’:\n In other words, the concept of progress is demobilizing; and Marxism\nhad become infected by the ideology of progress. However, rather than\npositing an existential alternative, in the manner of Heidegger’s\n‘resolute decision’, Benjamin set out to construct novel\nconceptions of historical time and historical intelligibility based on\nthe relationship, not between the past and the present, but between the\n‘then’ and the ‘now’, as brought together in\nimages of the past. Each historically specific ‘now’ was\nunderstood to correspond to (in a Baudelairean sense), or to render\nlegible, a particular ‘then’.  The experimental method of montage, borrowed from surrealism, was to\nbe the means of production of historical intelligibility. Furthermore,\nthe ‘static’ temporality of the image was understood to\nconnect such an experience of historical meaning, directly, to a\nradical or ‘revolutionary’ concept of action, associated\nwith the idea of the present as crisis. The passage above continues: Such “perilous critical moments” are both immanent to\nthe temporality of modernity, at a structural level (the temporality of\ncrisis), and, in each particular case, contingent and conjuncturally\nspecific. In them, the past is understood “to bring the present\ninto a critical state”. However, this critical state is not a\ncrisis of the status quo, but rather of its destruction: the critical\nmoment is that in which “the status quo threatens to be\npreserved” (AP, [N10, 2], 474). Dialectical images counter the\nthreat of preservation (tradition) by virtue of the interruptive force\nthey are understood to impart to experience as a consequence of the\ninstantaneous temporality of the now, or what Benjamin famously called\nnow-time [Jetztzeit]:\n“The dialectical image is an image that emerges suddenly, in a\nflash” (AP, [N9, 7], 473). It is this image of the image as a\n‘flash’ [ein aufblitzendes]\nand the corresponding image of historical experience as the discharge\nof an explosive force—the explosive force of now-time, blasting\nopen ‘the continuum of history’—for which Benjamin\nis probably best known. The philosophy of historical time which these\nimages sum up was elaborated by him in two main contexts: the\ndevelopment of a new conception of cultural history and a political\ndiagnosis of the historical crisis of Europe at the outset of the\nSecond World War. Benjamin did not see culture as threatened by\n‘barbarism’, so much as itself being implicated in\nit: The concept of culture as the values of a heritage was for Benjamin\n‘fetishistic’: “Culture appears reified.” Only\nan understanding of “the crucial importance of reception…\nenables us to correct the process of reification which takes place in\na work of art” (SW 3, 267; 269). For Benjamin, however,\nreception—or what he called the ‘afterlife’\n[Nachleben] of the work—was not merely something that\nhappened to the work, externally; it was as constitutive of\nthe work itself as its ‘fore-life’ [Vorleben], or\nconditions of production—which are themselves rendered invisible\nby the idea of culture as value, and are themselves “involved in\na constant process of change” as the work itself changes. A\nmaterialist cultural history would restore to the experience of works\na sense of both of these changing sets of conditions (before and\nafter), and the conflicts between them, in an engagement\n“originary for every present”, since “[i]t is the\npresent that polarizes the event into fore- and\nafter-history”  (SW 3, 261–2; AP, [N7a, 8], 471). It\nis here, in an ontological rethinking of reception, that the\nphilosophical significance of Benjamin’s interest in technologies of\nreproduction lies. With these concepts of fore- and afterlife,\nBenjamin founded a new problematic for cultural study. Benjamin was interested in ‘culture’ not as an\nautonomous realm of values (“the independent values of aesthetic,\nscientific, ethical… and even religious achievements”),\nbut on the contrary, like the sociologist Georg Simmel, whose Philosophy of Money\nhe cities in this regard, as “elements in the development of\nhuman nature” (Simmel, quoted in AP, [N14, 3], 480). In this\nrespect, cultural study is situated within the field of a materialist\nphilosophy of history. And the philosophy of history insists on a\nconception of history as a whole. It is here than the messianic\nstructure of Benajmin’s concept of history confronts us as\nunavoidable; although not thereby necessarily\n‘theological’, since it is the transition of a conceptual\nstructure from one philosophical context into another that is at issue\n(Benjamin’s favorite surrealist method of\n‘decontextualization’ and ‘defamiliarization’),\nnot its meaning in its original theological context as such. In his\nsearch for a non-Hegelian, non-developmentalist conception of history\nas a whole, in ‘On the Concept of History’ Benjamin figured\nnow-time, quasi-messianically, alternatively as a ‘model’\nof messianic time and as “shot through with splinters of\nmessianic time.” In the context of a diagnosis of the European\ncrisis of 1939–40 as a world-historical crisis, the\n‘critical state of the present’ thus came, in this text, to\nacquire a theological-political tenor. “A revolutionary chance in\nthe fight for the oppressed past” is compared to “the sign\nof a messianic arrest of happening” (SW 4, 396–7). Benjamin\nwas aware that this rhetoric would lead to misunderstanding. But the\ncombination of perceived political urgency and isolation compelled him\nto extend his concept of history beyond the state of his philosophical\nresearch, experimentally, into an apparently definitive statement. It\nis as if Benjamin had hoped to overcome the aporia of action within his\nstill essentially hermeneutical philosophy (Osborne 1995) through the\nforce of language alone. Formally, however, ‘On the Concept of\nHistory’ should be read as a series of fragments, in the early\nRomantic sense. As such, it remains resolutely negative—and\nthereby importantly partial—in its evocation of the historical\nwhole, which is acknowledged as unpresentable. In this respect,\nBenjamin’s final text recalls his earliest major publication, the\n1919 thesis ‘The Concept of Art Criticism in German\nRomanticism’: as a gesture towards the philosophy of history\nneeded to complete a modified and ‘modernized’ version of\nthe early Romantic project.","contact.mail":"m.charles1@westminster.ac.uk","contact.domain":"westminster.ac.uk"}]
