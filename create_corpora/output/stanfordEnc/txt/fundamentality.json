This metaphysical notion is related to the vernacular use of\n“fundamental”, but philosophers have also put forward\nvarious technical definitions of the notion. Among the most\ninfluential of these is the definition of absolute\nfundamentality in terms of ontological independence or\nungroundedness. Accordingly, the notion of fundamentality is\noften associated with these two other technical notions, covered under\n ontological dependence\n and\n metaphysical grounding\n in this encyclopedia.\n\n\nWhy are philosophers interested in fundamentality? One reason comes\nfrom a certain view of science. It is not uncommon to think that\nparticle physics has some special role in our inquiry into the\nstructure of reality. After all, every material entity is made up of\nfundamental particles. So, one might think that particle physics aims\nto describe the fundamental level of reality, which contains\nthe basic building blocks of nature. We can then employ the notion of\nrelative fundamentality, which enables us to express the\nhierarchical nature of reality disclosed by science, according to\nwhich the facts of biochemistry depend on the facts of elementary\nchemistry, which depend in turn on the allegedly fundamental facts of\nfundamental particle physics.\n\n\nThe thought that this priority ordering terminates at the fundamental\nlevel is often expressed with the notion of well-foundedness.\nThe view that reality is well-founded in the relevant sense is called\nmetaphysical foundationalism, in contrast with\nmetaphysical infinitism. A further option, which undermines\nthe priority ordering and suggests that dependence chains can form\nloops, is called metaphysical coherentism.\n\n\nWe can identify two key tasks for the notion of fundamentality. The\nfirst is to capture the idea that there is a foundation of being,\nwhich consists of independent entities. The second is to\ncapture the idea that the fundamental entities constitute a\ncomplete basis that all else depends on. These tasks are\nrelated. In fact, the first would seem to require the second, but not\nthe other way around. We will see that prioritizing one or the other\nof these tasks may result in different accounts of fundamentality. The\nsecond task may be applied to relative fundamentality and used to\nexpress the idea that there is a hierarchy of being whereby some\nentities are more fundamental than others, although strictly speaking\nthis hierarchical picture is independent of the notion of a complete\nbasis.\n\n\nThis entry will focus on the contemporary discussion, but many of the\nideas debated in the contemporary literature have been around for\nmillennia. We now have the tools to make these important ideas much\nmore precise. Relevant historical issues include ancient atomism\n(e.g., Leucippus and Democritus, see the separate entry on\n ancient atomism),\n Aristotle’s many discussions of priority (see, e.g., Peramatzis\n2011 and the articles in Sirkel & Tahko 2014), Aquinas’s\ndiscussion of the first cause (see the entry on the\n cosmological argument),\n and the\n principle of sufficient reason,\n as discussed by Spinoza and Leibniz, among others.\n\nThere are many senses in which a thing may be said to be\nfundamental—some technical, some relatively intuitive. A very\ncommon way to think about fundamentality is in terms of independence,\nwhereby for any notion of dependence D, an entity is\nD-fundamental if and only if it does not\ndependD on anything else (or on anything else that\ndoes not depend on it). This independence-based characterization of\nfundamentality will be discussed in sections\n 1.1\n and\n 1.2.\n There are also other ways to understand fundamentality; these include\nfundamentality as a complete description of reality\n (section 1.3)\n and as primitive\n (section 1.4).\n So, there are many ways to understand fundamentality and whether\nthere is any single idea of fundamentality that these different ways\nare trying to capture is a substantial issue. But even if there is no\nunified sense of fundamentality, one interesting question is whether\nthere are any fundamental entities, where “fundamental” is\nunderstood in one of the different ways that will be specified below.\nWe might also ask whether we need such entities, whether given\ntheories are committed to their existence, and what the role of\nfundamentalia is in explanation. Before we get started, a few\npreliminary issues need to be mentioned. \nFor present purposes, we are interested in the notion of a fundamental\nthing, or type of thing. The candidates for fundamentality\nmay include objects, such as electrons, but they may also include\nproperties, or facts. The choice regarding the relevant type of entity\nmay depend on one’s preferred account of fundamentality.\nHowever, there is often an acceptable translation between different\n views.[1]\n For instance, let’s say that we take the fact <electrons\nhave unit negative charge> to be fundamental. Someone who does not\nwish to ascribe fundamentality to facts (e.g., because they do not\nhave facts in their ontology), could understand this to be saying that\nthe property unit negative charge is fundamental and\ninstantiated in electrons. The translation here is from electrons\nhave unit negative charge to the fundamental property unit\nnegative charge that is instantiated in electrons (and only\nthem). So, the disagreement between those who consider fundamentality\nto concern facts and those who regard objects and properties as\nfundamentalia may not be as serious as it looks. \nWe should also distinguish between the fundamentality of entities\nbelonging to a certain ontological category and the fundamentality of\nthe ontological category itself. It is one thing to say that certain\nproperties are fundamental; another to say that the category\nproperty is a fundamental category. We are mostly concerned\nwith the former issue, but the debate about which ontological\ncategories are fundamental and how many such categories there are has\nbeen lively throughout the history of Western philosophy. For\ninstance, Aristotle may have thought that substances are the only\ncategory that is separate from and hence more fundamental\nthan other categories, such as the category universals (Aristotle\nPhysics 185a31–32; Metaphysics\n 1029a27–28).[2] \nSince one key task for the notion of fundamentality is to help us\narticulate the view that there is a hierarchical structure to\nreality, it is usually assumed that the dependence relation we are\ndealing with must be asymmetric. Typically, the relation\nwould also be considered transitive and irreflexive,\nhence producing a strict partial ordering. However, each of\nthese formal characteristics can in fact be questioned, albeit whether\nthis undermines the layered conception is up for debate (see Rabin\n 2018).[3] \nWe have noted that relative fundamentality is a very important notion,\nsince the second key task for fundamentality identified above concerns\nthe hierarchy of fundamentality. Moreover, relative fundamentality\ncould arguably be used to define absolute fundamentality (some entity\nx is absolutely fundamental if and only if it is not relatively\nfundamental to any entity y). In contrast, relative\nfundamentality cannot be defined in terms of absolute fundamentality,\nso there are reasons to think that we should focus on relative\nfundamentality, insofar as the notion makes sense. Given this, it is\nperhaps surprising that there are relatively few explicit accounts of\nrelative fundamentality in the literature so far, but we will refer to\nit where relevant (see Wilson 2012, 2016; Zylstra 2014; Koslicki 2015;\nBennett 2017: Ch. 6; deRosset 2017; Correia forthcoming). \nFinally, the notion of naturalness and the related notion of\nsparseness, familiar especially from Lewis’s work (see\nLewis 1986, 2009; Schaffer 2004; Dorr & Hawthorne 2013; McDaniel\n2013, 2017; Thompson 2016a) is sometimes connected with\nfundamentality. Sider’s (2011) influential notion of\nstructure is closely related to the notion of naturalness.\nPerfectly natural properties might seem to be good candidates for\nabsolutely fundamental entities. Naturalness is no doubt a close\ncousin of fundamentality, but there are some reasons to think that the\ntwo notions cannot do the same jobs (see Bennett 2017: Ch. 5.7). Most\nstrikingly, there may be perfectly natural entities that are dependent\nin ways that are clearly ruled out by many of the definitions of\nfundamentality that we will shortly\n consider.[4]\n For further discussion, see the supplement on\n the natural/non-natural distinction\n in the entry on\n David Lewis’s metaphysics. \nThe first definition of fundamentality to be considered may be labeled\nAbsolute Independence: \nWhat is included in D? We can give an open-ended list of\ncandidate relations: grounding, dependence between wholes and their\nparts (known as mereological or compositional dependence),\nrealization, existential dependence, essential dependence, and,\ncontroversially, even causal dependence (on the link to causation, see\nBernstein 2016; Koslicki 2016; Schaffer 2016b; Shaheen 2017). The list\nis open-ended partly because there is disagreement about what counts\nas a metaphysical dependence relation in the relevant sense and partly\nbecause there may be metaphysical dependence relations that we wish to\nrule out. A possible criterion (i.e., the “relevant\nsense”) to be included in the list is that the dependence\nrelations in question must have at least some features in common, such\nas, perhaps, transitivity. Furthermore, two philosophers may disagree,\nsay, about whether compositional dependence is a genuine metaphysical\ndependence relation. So, for these two philosophers,\n (AI)\n will produce a different definition of fundamentality, because the\nscope of D is different. We will not attempt to give a complete\nlist or to define all these different kinds of metaphysical\ndependence, but for further details on some of them, see the separate\nentries on\n ontological dependence\n and\n metaphysical grounding.[5] \nWhat is important is that\n (AI)\n is an attempt to define fundamentality in the most general terms\npossible, using a very broad notion of metaphysical dependence. There\nis, however, at least one kind of dependence that we will likely wish\nto exclude from D, namely, modal dependence. The\nreason for this is simple: nothing will be independent in the sense of\n(AI) if modal independence is required (cf. Wang 2016). This is\nevident if we consider some necessary existents, such as numbers\n(assuming that numbers exist necessarily), for it is necessarily the\ncase that the number 2 exists if Socrates does. Hence, the existence\nof Socrates necessitates the existence of the number 2. Moreover, the\nnumber 2 necessitates the existence of the number 3 and the other way\naround. This obviously generalizes, resulting in no entity whatsoever\nbeing “absolutely existentially modally free”, as Wang\n(2016) puts it. \nEven if we rule out modal dependence,\n (AI)\n is a very strong sense of fundamentality, probably much too strong.\nAccordingly, it may not be a very popular option. Indeed, it is\ndifficult to find a direct endorsement of (AI) in the literature. That\nbeing said, there are some potential if controversial candidates for\nabsolutely independent entities, such as God. Perhaps it is also\npossible to think of the universe as a whole as absolutely independent\nin this sense. This might reflect something like Georges\nLemaître’s theory of the “primeval atom” or\nthe “Cosmic Egg” hypothesis—an idea now better known\nas the Big Bang theory. Lemaître’s hypothesis was that the\nobserved expansion of the universe may have started from a single\npoint, the primeval atom, which would have contained the entire mass\nof the universe. Now, one may of course postulate that the primeval\natom itself could depend on something else, such as God, but this\nnevertheless gives us an entirely naturalistically motivated idea of\nabsolute independence. The metaphysical position that comes closest to\nthis idea would be a type of monism, perhaps motivated by\nconsiderations emerging from quantum holism (Calosi 2013; Ney 2015;\nIsmael & Schaffer forthcoming; and the entry on\n monism). \nWhy does fundamentality defined in terms of\n (AI)\n seem too strong? One major reason for this is that many things that\nwe might normally regard as fundamental turn out to be dependent on\nother things in one sense or another. For instance, let us suppose\nthat there is a mereologically fundamental level, that is, there are\nmereological atoms that do not have any proper parts. If mereological\ndependence runs from the wholes to their parts contra priority\nmonism of the type defended by Schaffer (2010a), these\nmereological atoms are clearly independent in a mereological\nsense and most philosophers would probably want to regard them as\nfundamental. But even if these mereological atoms are mereologically\nindependent, they could still metaphysically depend on other entities\nin another sense. \nConsider an example from physics. The Standard Model of particle\nphysics treats quarks as point-like particles that have no internal\nstructure; they are mereological atoms. But quarks do not exist\nindependently; they come in groups of two or three, such as in the\ncase of mesons, protons, and neutrons. So, you do not get freely\nexisting quarks, mereological atoms though they may be. There seems to\nbe at least a weak type of symmetric existential dependence\nbetween the three quarks that compose, say, a given proton. In other\nwords, the three quarks that compose a proton are symmetrically\ndependent on each other for their existence and perhaps even for their\nidentity or essence, though this is much more\ncontroversial (see the entry on\n ontological dependence\n for discussion on identity-dependence and essential dependence). \nIn more detail, the strong bond between quarks is known as quark\nconfinement and it is sometimes illustrated with the “bag\nmodel”. The idea is to think of a quark triplet as if it was\ninside a stretchy bag. If you then try to separate one of the quarks\nin the triplet, you’ll discover that the bag resists your\nefforts with an increasing force. The energy that would be required to\nisolate a quark from the triplet is far greater than the pair\nproduction energy of a quark-antiquark pair. So, what happens is that\nbefore the isolation could happen, the energy being directed to the\nprocess produces mesons—quark-antiquark pairs. Instead of\npulling apart a quark from a quark triplet you end up with a\nquark-antiquark pair (and the original quark triplet remains intact).\nHence, it appears that the quarks in a triplet are existentially\ndependent on each other. It is important to see that this dependence\namong the quarks may not be purely causal. If there were independently\nexisting quarks that sometimes get bagged together, then their mutual\ndependence would indeed seem to be merely causal. But given that we\nhave never observed independently existing quarks, it seems that the\nexistence of one quark necessitates the existence of another one. This\nis already enough for existential\n dependence.[6] \nIt turns out that many intuitive candidates for fundamentalia would\nnot be fundamental on the\n (AI)\n definition of fundamentality. One could, however, also consider\nallowing the fundamentalia to be symmetrically dependent on each other\n(see Priest\n 2018).[7] \nThere are two further issues to note. Firstly, as it is formulated,\n (AI)\n leaves open whether the fundamental entities can depend on\nthemselves, but this is an issue that the proponent of fundamentality\nshould ultimately address. In the case of (AI), the definition is\nextremely strong already, so it might be reasonable to leave room for\nself-dependent entities (as do Bliss & Priest 2018b). \nSecondly, there is an interesting class of entities that are\nfundamental according to\n (AI),\n but may cause trouble for other views about fundamentality. These\nentities are sometimes known as “idlers” (e.g., Lewis\n2009: 205; Bennett 2017: 123). For Lewis, idlers are fundamental\nproperties, which are instantiated in the actual world, but\n“play no active role in the workings of nature”. So,\nidlers are at least causally isolated. However, we can further\npostulate that “absolute idlers” are absolutely isolated:\nthey depend on nothing, and nothing, at least nothing concrete,\ndepends on them. Absolute idlers would thus be absolutely independent\nin the sense required by (AI). Whether there are any such absolute\nidlers is of course another question. If there are any absolute\nidlers, they are rather uninteresting entities—indeed, they are\npresumably completely beyond our ken given their isolation. Moreover,\nfor the idea of absolute idlers to have any plausibility, we would\nhave to restrict their isolation in such a way that they may\nparticipate in abstract constructions such as sets. \nThe second definition of fundamentality to be considered is much more\nversatile and weaker than\n (AI).\n We call it restricted independence. This produces a\nrelativized sense of fundamentality, where fundamentality is\nrelative to a certain variety or varieties of metaphysical dependence.\nOne should not confuse this with relative fundamentality,\nwhich concerns the priority ordering between two (non-fundamental)\nentities. So, restricted independence starts from the idea that for\neach metaphysical dependence relation there is a corresponding notion\nof fundamentality and we must relativize the notion of fundamentality\naccordingly: \n(RI) is restricted to concern only some specific kinds of metaphysical\ndependence, because it is plausible that some metaphysical dependence\nrelations, such as modal dependence (as we saw in\n section 1.1),\n would immediately rule out fundamental entities. Notice that (RI)\nstill includes the possibility of including several dependence\nrelations, but we can easily define a restricted sense of dependence\nfor each of \\(D_{1}\\), \\(D_{2}\\) … \\(D_{N}\\). We may also\ndefine a much weaker sense of restricted independence, call it\nsome-independence: \nHowever, even if (SI) does have some use, it is likely to be too weak\nto be of much use in defining fundamentality, as it will capture\nentities that are independent in radically different ways. \nWe have already discussed some kinds of metaphysical dependence that\n (RI)\n could apply to, such as grounding and mereological dependence. (RI)\nconcerns the subset of those metaphysical dependence relations that\nare considered relevant to fundamentality, so here two philosophers\ncould disagree about which dependence relations to include in that\nsubset. Variations of this conception of fundamentality can be found\nthroughout the literature and it is probably as close to a standard\nconception as we are likely to find (a few examples: Schaffer 2009:\n373; Dixon 2016: 442; Bennett 2017: 105; see also Tahko 2015: Ch. 6;\nBliss & Priest 2018b). There are, of course, many differences\nbetween the various accounts. Variations of (RI) are standard enough\nto have been picked up by most of those critical towards this\nconception of fundamentality as well (Bliss 2013: 413; Morganti 2015:\n559; Raven 2016:\n 608).[8] \nBoth\n (AI)\n and\n (RI)\n could be understood as putting forward the idea that fundamental\nreality needs a relational underpinning (on the notion of a\nrelational underpinning, compare Fine 2001: 25). In other words,\nwhatever fundamentality amounts to, it must be the case that one (or\nseveral) of the various relations of metaphysical dependence may be\nused to define fundamentality. But since (RI) leaves completely open\nwhich of the metaphysical dependence relations are in fact relevant to\nfundamentality, we should mention some examples. At one point in the\nearly 2000s, it may have been the case that most philosophers using\nthe notion of fundamentality had in mind what we might call\nmereological fundamentality whereby the relevant kind of\ndependence is mereological dependence (see especially Schaffer 2003).\nA concise definition of mereological dependence is offered by Kim:\n \nthe properties of a whole, or the fact that a whole instantiates a\ncertain property, may depend on the properties and relations had by\nits parts. (2010: 183; see also Markosian 2005; Thalos 2010, 2013)\n \nHowever, even though mereological dependence is still sometimes\nconsidered to be relevant to fundamentality, it is becoming less\ncommon to view it as the only relevant kind of dependence\n(Wilsch 2016; Bennett 2017: 8–9). Be that as it may, there is\ncertainly an esteemed history for this type of idea, given that\n(mereological) atomism of the type defended already by ancient\nphilosophers such as Leucippus and Democritus would appear to be an\ninstance of the view (see the separate entry on\n ancient atomism\n for details). \nIt is important to see that the thesis that some things are\nmereologically fundamental does not entail a commitment to atomism.\nHere it may be helpful to introduce the distinction between (priority)\npluralism and monism. We have already seen that a\nmonist might be attracted to a view about fundamentality where there\nis just one fundamental entity, such as the cosmos or universe as a\nwhole (Schaffer 2010a is a good exposition and defense of this\nSpinoza-inspired view; see also Newlands 2010). This view does not\ndirectly entail anything about the relative fundamentality relations\namong the non-fundamental, but it enables us to better understand that\nthe converse of mereological dependence, as Kim defines it, might\nhold: instead of wholes depending on their parts, the parts could\ndepend on the whole. This contrasts with the more familiar idea, often\nassociated with but not entailed by atomism, that mereological\ndependence must run from the larger to the smaller, mereological atoms\nbeing the fundamental entities. So, the choice concerning the\ndirection of the relevant dependence relation is often reflected by\nthe choice between priority pluralism and monism, although strictly\nspeaking these issues are independent (Miller 2009; Trogdon 2009;\nCotnoir 2013; Steinberg 2015; Tallant 2015). Two proponents of\n (RI),\n even if they agree on which proper subset of metaphysical dependence\nrelations is relevant to fundamentality, may disagree on the direction\nof the relevant dependence\n relation(s).[9] \nMoving on to a different subspecies of\n (RI),\n we see a clear link between grounding and fundamentality, where\ngrounding is understood as expressing a non-causal connection between\ntwo things. For example, a certain act might be considered evil\nbecause it causes harm. The “because” in this statement\ndoes not express a causal link; instead, it tells us what\ngrounds the evilness of the act. Similarly, one might think\nthat mental states hold in virtue of neurophysiological states or that\na substance is prior to its tropes. The notions of “in virtue\nof” and “prior to” in these cases may be understood\nin terms of grounding. What is likely to be the most common\ncontemporary understanding of (RI) is that the most important (if not\nthe only) relation of metaphysical dependence that is relevant to\nfundamentality is grounding. Note, however, that grounding as well\ncould be understood as a family of dependence relations (Trogdon\n2013). \nOn the grounding-based characterization of fundamentality, the\nfundamentalia are ungrounded entities: everything is either\nungrounded or ultimately grounded in the fundamental, ungrounded\nentities (Schaffer 2009: 353; Audi 2012: 710; Dasgupta 2014a: 536;\nRaven 2016: 613). For instance, Audi (2012: 710) explicitly\ndistinguishes between the explanatorily fundamental and the\ncompositionally fundamental where the first is associated\nwith grounding and the second with mereological dependence. As Audi\ncorrectly notes, one would think that often these two notions of\nfundamentality would overlap. But recall that we’ve just\nobserved that the converse of mereological dependence, running from\nthe smaller to the larger, could hold. For the priority monist, this\ndependence relation running from the smaller to the larger is\ngrounding, so it would also produce a different understanding of\nfundamentality. \nIf explanatory fundamentality and compositional fundamentality are\ngenuinely two different notions corresponding to two independent\nnotions of fundamentality, then\n (RI)\n does allow the overlap of explanatory and compositional\nfundamentality. But there could certainly be other considerations that\ncount against this. For instance, if (RI) is understood to mean that\nto be fundamental is just to be at the termination point of some\ndependence relation, then the debate between monism and pluralism\ncould just be a debate about the direction of compositional\nfundamentality, where compositional fundamentality terminates in the\nmereological atoms and its converse terminates in the whole cosmos. In\nother words, this could be understood as a debate about whether\nexplanatory fundamentality aligns with compositional fundamentality or\nits converse. Whichever way we go here, we would seem to end up\naligning some notions of fundamentality and misaligning others. \nAn important question arises: should we indeed postulate several\nindependent notions of fundamentality, relativized to each of the\nmetaphysical dependence relations, or should we aim to define only one\nsense of fundamentality, either to be defined in terms of just one\nrelation of metaphysical dependence or in terms of some privileged\nproper subset of these relations? \nGiven that there are good reasons to exclude some notions of\ndependence, such as modal dependence and perhaps causal dependence, it\nwould appear that there is an additional question about why only some\nnotions of dependence are such that we want to define a corresponding\nnotion of fundamentality for them. There is an obvious challenge for\nthe view that we should postulate several relativized notions of\nfundamentality. The challenge is simply that the notion of\nfundamentality would seem to do little in addition to the various\nrelativized notions of (in)dependence. Indeed, this is likely to cause\nconfusion, because the notion of fundamentality is sometimes used in\nthe literature without any mention of which relativized sense of\nindependence is in question. Moreover, since different types of\nmetaphysical dependence have different formal properties (e.g., some\nare strict partial orders, but some might be symmetric, reflexive or\nnon-transitive) and they can perhaps even run in different directions,\nit is difficult to see what could unify the different notions\nof fundamentality, i.e., the proper subset of those dependence\nrelations that we consider to be relevant for\n fundamentality.[10] \nThose who think that grounding is strongly unified often appeal to its\nformal properties (but for a different approach, see Trogdon 2018a).\nThese properties may be debated, but if grounding is strongly unified,\nthen one could hold that for a relation to count as grounding, it\nshould at least fit these properties. Relevant formal properties\ninclude the following: grounding is a strict partial order,\nnon-monotonic in the sense that we cannot add arbitrary\ngrounds and expect that grounding still holds (i.e., if A is\ngrounded in B, then it does not follow that A is\ngrounded in B and C), and it is thought that grounds\nmetaphysically necessitate what they ground (although see Leuenberger\n2014; Skiles 2015 against necessitation). In contrast, Bennett’s\nbuilding relations (see\n note 10)\n do not share all their formal properties. She holds that\nthey’re all antisymmetric and irreflexive, but not necessarily\ntransitive (Bennett 2017: 46). Another example of this type of\n“multi-dimensional” approach to fundamentality can be\nfound in Koslicki’s (2012, 2015, 2016)\n work.[11] \nIt’s important to see that on a multi-dimensional view whereby\nthe various dependence relations relevant to fundamentality might even\nrun in different directions, one must be very careful indeed to\nspecify which relativized notion of fundamentality one has in mind. If\nit turns out that some entity is independent in all the relativized\nsenses of independence relevant to fundamentality, then it would seem\nthat we are back to absolute independence\n (AI)\n (or independence “full stop”, as Bennett 2017: 106 calls\nit). \nHere we would do well to systematically distinguish between those\nproponents of\n (RI)\n who hold that only one metaphysical dependence relation, e.g.,\nmereological dependence or a strongly unified notion of grounding, is\nrelevant to fundamentality and those who think that a proper subset of\nthese relations is relevant to fundamentality. Sometimes the labels\nmonism and pluralism are used to distinguish between\nthe singular fundamentality view and the multi-dimensional view, but\nin the interest of clarity we should introduce different terms, as we\nhave already used these labels for another\n purpose.[12]\n So, let us use the labels (RI-one) and (RI-many) to distinguish\nbetween those who think that there is only one notion of\nfundamentality and those who think that there are several. Typically,\nthere is an easy translation between these views. Let us say that a\nproponent of (RI-one) thinks that only mereological dependence is\nrelevant to fundamentality. Well, a proponent of (RI-many), provided\nthat mereological dependence is one of the relations they consider\nrelevant to fundamentality, can simply translate the (RI-one) notion\nof fundamentality into their (RI-many) notion of mereological\nfundamentality. Hence the disagreement is that from the (RI-one) point\nof view, there is a single notion of fundamentality, and they would\nthink that (RI-many) mistakenly holds other notions of fundamentality\nto be genuine, whereas from the (RI-many) point of view, there are\nmany relativized notions of fundamentality, and (RI-one) mistakenly\npicks just one, or indeed none depending on whether the relevant\n(RI-one) relation is\n included.[13] \nWe conclude this section by posing a further question to all\nproponents of\n (RI):\n what is it that privileges the proper subset of metaphysical\ndependence relations that are relevant to fundamentality, be there one\nor many of them? What makes these dependence relations relevant for\nfundamentality? Given that one major task for the notion of\nfundamentality is often thought to be related to the idea of the\nhierarchical structure of reality, one potential starting point might\nbe to appeal to asymmetry and transitivity, but we have seen that\nthere may be relations of dependence that are relevant to\nfundamentality that fail to be transitive. At this point, it may be\nhelpful to move on to the third potential definition of\nfundamentality, as something along the lines of this definition is\noften used to characterize fundamentality defined in terms of (RI) as\nwell. \nThe conception of fundamentality to be considered in this section is\noften used to explicate the second key task for the notion of\nfundamentality, that of the fundamental entities acting as the basic\nbuilding blocks of reality. According to this approach, the\nfundamental entities determine everything else. By giving a complete\nlist of the fundamental entities, we can provide a minimal complete\ndescription of reality. So, we are now shifting our focus from that\nwhich everything else depends on to that which, as it were, supports\neverything else. This idea is often invoked to characterize\nfundamentality, but not necessarily to define it (Schaffer 2010a:\n39n14; Sider 2011: 16–18; Jenkins 2013: 212; Paul 2012: 221;\nTahko 2014: 263; Wilson 2014: 561; Raven 2016: 609; Bennett 2017:\n107ff.). The idea is that fundamentality can be understood in terms of\na complete minimal basis: \nThe idea of a “basis” can be interpreted in several ways.\nAn obvious candidate is to think of the basis as a set of entities. It\nis quite natural to formulate (CMB) in terms of a complete minimal\nset and we will continue to do so in what follows (and so does\nBennett 2017: 110). Another notion to be clarified in (CMB) is\n“determines”. This should be understood as a placeholder,\nwhich is meant to encompass the various ways in which fundamentalia\nmay give rise to higher-level phenomena. So, “determines”\ncould be replaced, e.g., by “grounds”,\n“realizes”, “composes”, or\n “builds”.[14]\n Importantly, this type of determination is supposed to be more than\nmere necessitation or supervenience, although the idea is closely\nrelated to traditional discussions of a minimal supervenience base\n(see Schaffer 2003; compare also with Schaffer’s notion of\n“generation” in Schaffer 2016b:\n 54).[15] \nThere are some preliminary issues to be specified before we can move\non to a more general discussion about\n (CMB). \nWe can now move on to some further\n issues.[18]\n One of these issues concerns how, exactly, we should interpret\n (CMB).\n We can find a common line of interpretation gestured at by Schaffer\n(2003: 509), Jenkins (2013: 212), Raven (2016: 609), and Tahko (2018)\nwhereby the complete minimal basis should be understood as giving a\ncomplete minimal description of reality. This may be compared to\nSchaffer’s “fundamental supervenience base”,\nJenkins’s “by appeal to which all the rest can be\nexplained”, Raven’s “ineliminability”, and\nTahko’s “ontological minimality”; see also Lewis\n(1986: 60). On this reading, less emphasis is put on the active role\nof the fundamentalia, the focus being instead on making sure to\ninclude a basis for everything in reality. \nOne consideration in favor of\n (RI)\n instead of\n (CMB)\n can be derived by considering a “flat world”, a world\nwhere everything is independent, either in the sense of\n (AI)\n or (RI), and nothing is built, to use Bennett’s notion (Bennett\n2017: 123–124). In a flat world, nothing determines anything\nelse in the sense of (CMB), since nothing depends on anything else. In\nthis case, everything is included in the unique minimally complete\nset. So, it won’t make a difference which definition of\nfundamentality we use here; we can say that everything is fundamental\nin the flat world both in the sense of (AI) or (RI) and in the sense\nof (CMB). That’s because the independent entities are in the\nunique minimally complete set due to their independence, not the other\nway around. Notice that for this to go through, the interpretation of\n(CMB) along the lines outlined in the previous paragraph is required,\ni.e., it’s not crucial that the fundamentalia do any\ndetermining. \nAnother possible reading (or additional commitment) of\n (CMB)\n could require that the fundamentalia must “actively”\ndetermine something in order to count among the fundamentalia. So,\nwhile (CMB) would seem to be vacuously true in a flat world, the\nproponent of this more “active” reading might disagree.\nDriven by the flat world example, one might then think that\n (AI)\n and\n (RI)\n are prior to (CMB). But remember that not all philosophers intend to\nuse (CMB) as a definition of fundamentality. (CMB) just expresses a\nconsequence of being fundamental. To address this worry, one might\nappeal to the fact that (CMB) is compatible with the idea that reality\nhas an irreducibly plural underpinning. That is, we should think of\n(CMB) as defining the plurality of the fundamental entities. On this\nview, a flat world—rather than being a world where everything is\nfundamental—would be a world where nothing is fundamental (or\nderivative), since nothing is “actively” determining\nanything. A world which contains no such structure would then turn out\nto be a world which contains no priority, hence no fundamentality (cf.\nWilson 2016: 199). \nA potentially more substantive reason to prefer\n (CMB)\n over\n (RI)\n is that it may be needed to account for cases such as\nmetaphysical coherentism, where loops of dependence are\npossible (see Bliss 2014, 2018; Barnes 2018; Morganti 2018; Nolan\n2018; and Thompson 2018). It should be emphasized that this view\nviolates asymmetry and hence drops the idea that the structure of\nreality is hierarchical. While this requires abandoning one of the key\ntasks that the notion of fundamentality is often thought to have, it\ndoes help in accommodating the idea that we should adopt a more\nholistic approach whereby entities can be mutually related and form\nloops or cycles. Sometimes an analogy from epistemology is offered, as\nthese loops of dependence could resemble a Quinean web of\nbelief, so that each entity depends on one or more other\nentities. Perhaps the most plausible example of the possibility of\nloops of dependence comes from\n ontic structural realism\n (OSR). (OSR) suggests that objects may be reduced to—or more\nmoderately, are ontologically on a par rather than prior\nto—relational structures. If (OSR) is true, we might have to\nrevise our views about what the fundamentalia could be, as they might\nbe relations rather than objects (for discussion on OSR and\nfundamentality, see Wolff 2012; McKenzie 2014; Morganti 2018; Tahko\n2018). What exactly happens to (CMB) on this type of view depends on\nthe details of the coherentist framework, but one possibility—on\na moderate understanding of (OSR)—is that the fundamentalia\nwould include mutually dependent relations and objects, which then\ndetermine everything else. Metaphysical coherentism remains one of the\nleast explored areas in contemporary literature, but future research\nmay solidify its position among the possible options. \nSimilarly, some forms of metaphysical infinitism, to be discussed in\nmore detail in\n section 4,\n could motivate\n (CMB)\n (Bliss 2013; Tahko 2014; Morganti 2014, 2018). On these views, it\ncould turn out that nothing is independent in the sense of\n (RI),\n but a sense of completeness could nevertheless be retained. \nAccording to primitivism about the fundamental, we cannot define\nfundamentality. But we may be able to characterize it, and it is to be\nexpected that\n (RI)\n and\n (CMB)\n are likely candidates in this regard. This type of view may be what\nFine (2001: 26) gestures towards, when he remarks that it is the\nworld’s intrinsic structure that is fundamental. One way to\ndevelop the idea is by defining absolute fundamentality in terms of\nrelative fundamentality and introducing a primitive notion of\n“Reality” as it is in itself (Fine 2001; see also Fine\n2009). Note however that Fine proposes this notion in connection to\nthe debate between realism and anti-realism, whereby\n“Reality” may be understood as objectivity. So, it is not\nentirely clear that we can understand fundamentality in terms of this\nnotion. \nMore generally, we may think that the absolute notion of fundamental\nreality is not in need of a relational underpinning (Fine\n2001; Wilson 2014: 561). This is in contrast to the various\ncomparative or relational notions of dependence that we have been\ndiscussing (see also Fine 2015). Note that primitivism must also be\ncontrasted with\n (CMB)\n insofar as it is understood as a definition of fundamentality, even\nthough it is not uncommon to see primitivist characterizations of\nfundamentality that resemble (CMB). For instance, a primitivist who\naccepts Fine’s notion of “Reality” would like to\ndistinguish between what is Real in itself and what may be true (i.e.,\nobjective) even if it does not concern the way that things are\nfundamentally. As Fine puts it,  \neven though two nations may be at war, we may deny that this is how\nthings really or fundamentally are because the entities in question,\nthe nations, and the relationship between them, are no part of Reality\nas it [is] in itself. (Fine 2001: 26) \nThe idea behind the primitivist view is actually very simple and it\nmay be prudent to try to capture it without the controversial notion\nof “Reality”. One way to do so would be to understand the\nentities in the fundamental base to be basic in the sense that they\nplay a role analogous to axioms in a theory, or that the fundamental\nentities are all that God had to bring about to make the world (Wilson\n2014: 560; 2016; see also Dorr 2005). We can find several occurrences\nof this type of heuristic in the literature on fundamentality, e.g.,\n \nThe primary is (as it were) all God would need to create. (Schaffer\n2009: 351) \nall God had to do when making the world was fix the qualitative facts;\n(Dasgupta 2014b: 14)  \nWe often explain the notion of fundamental reality in intuitive terms\nby saying that all God had to do in order to create the world was fix\nthe fundamental facts. (Glazier 2016: 35)  \nTo drive the idea home, consider the following passage from\nKripke: \nSuppose we imagine God creating the world; what does He need to do to\nmake the identity of heat and molecular motion obtain? Here it would\nseem that all He needs to do is to create the heat, that is, the\nmolecular motion itself. If the air molecules on this earth are\nsufficiently agitated, if there is a burning fire, then the earth will\nbe hot even if there are no observers to see it. God created light\n(and thus created streams of photons, according to present scientific\ndoctrine) before He created human and animal observers; and the same\npresumably holds for heat. How then does it appear to us that the\nidentity of molecular motion with heat is a substantive scientific\nfact, that the mere creation of molecular motion still leaves God with\nthe additional task of making molecular motion into heat? This feeling\nis indeed illusory, but what is a substantive task for the\nDeity is the task of making molecular motion felt as heat. To do this\nHe must create some sentient beings to insure that the molecular\nmotion produces the sensation S in them. Only after he has done\nthis will there be beings who can learn that the sentence “Heat\nis the motion of molecules” expresses an a posteriori\ntruth in precisely the same way that we do. (Kripke 1980: 153) \nNow, Kripke is of course not trying to put forward an account of\nfundamentality here, but rather to specify that the qualitative\nexperience of feeling heat is something additional to molecular\nmotion. The idea, however, is strikingly close to the primitivist\naccount of fundamentality, whereby the important thing is to find a\nsufficiently rich basis for everything in the world—this is of\ncourse reminiscent of\n (CMB),\n but here the heuristic is simply used to characterize fundamentality,\nnot to define it. \nSince the primitivist thinks that we cannot define fundamentality, one\nmight wonder how it is that she can decide on what the fundamental\nentities are. In other words, what is our epistemic access to issues\nconcerning fundamentality? A possible answer is that we proceed the\nsame way as we do with other primitives in metaphysics. That is, by\nasking how the view that x is fundamental fits in our overall\ntheory. How does it fare with regard to our other commitments? These\nare issues where theoretical virtues such as simplicity and\nexplanatory power might be employed (for a related discussion, see\nSchaffer 2014). However, this is not the place to tackle the\nadmittedly difficult epistemic questions surrounding metaphysical\ntheories in general, or the criteria that are to be employed in\ntheory-choice. The primitivist about fundamentality may have one more\nprimitive in their overall theory, and this, of course, calls for\njustification. But conceiving of the fundamental as primitive is no\nmore mysterious than conceiving of, say, naturalness or grounding as\nprimitive. This is not to say that postulating naturalness or\ngrounding as primitives wouldn’t also require some justification\nthough. \nThe primitivist about fundamentality does, however, face some\nchallenges that are specific to fundamentality. Some of these\nchallenges have been raised by Schaffer (2016a), targeting\nWilson’s proposal. A potentially helpful clarification from\nSchaffer is the following: there is something primitive in each of the\ntheories on offer, but the primitivist about fundamentality takes\nbeing-absolutely-fundamental as that primitive, whereas at\nleast certain proponents of the relative independence\n (RI)\n view (such as Schaffer himself and, e.g., Rosen 2010) take the\n“linking notion” of grounding,\nbeing-relatively-more-fundamental-than-and-linked-to, as the\nprimitive (Schaffer 2016a: 157). As Schaffer notes, one may also take\nboth to be primitive, as Fine perhaps does. Schaffer argues that while\nabsolute fundamentality can be quite easily defined in terms of\ngrounding, as we’ve seen with (RI), it may not be so easy to\ndefine grounding in terms of absolute fundamentality. \nThe core of the worry is this: if there is no fundamental level, then\nthere is no way to account for relative fundamentality, and hence one\nof the two key tasks for fundamentality would be lost. In contrast,\nthe friend of\n (RI)\n can still construct a priority ordering using her favorite notion of\ndependence, since no absolutely fundamental level is needed to get the\nordering started (Schaffer 2016a,\n 158).[19]\n How can the primitivist reply? \nOne possibility is to try fixing the direction of priority even in the\nabsence of an absolutely fundamental level (Wilson 2016: 196ff.).\nDrawing on a suggestion from Montero (2006: 179), Wilson proposes that\nanalogously to an infinite sequence of numbers such as 1/2, 1/3, 1/4\n… being still “bounded below” by zero, there could\nbe an infinite descent of fundamental entities that approaches a limit\nwhereby the limit acts as the fundamental level even though it is\nnever reached. Related ideas may be found elsewhere in the literature\n(Tahko 2014; Morganti 2015; Raven 2016). One difficulty with this\nproposal is that applying the notion of a limit assumes that we can\nassign a numerical measure to the descending entities that approach\nthis limit. So, we would need to be able to construct the hierarchical\nstructure of relative fundamentality in such a way that this numerical\nmeasure applies to it. Moreover, even if approaching a limit does not\nnecessarily need to be constructed numerically, the notion of a limit\nitself requires postulating the (fundamental) limit, in this case\nzero. While zero is not part of the sequence, it does seem to be part\nof the ontology. \nAnother possible strategy to address this challenge to primitivism is\nto argue that fixing the fundamental is not (always) enough to fix the\npriority ordering. Rather, we should pay close attention to the\nvarious dependence relations that interest us, such as the parthood\nrelation, and assess the nature of the non-fundamental entities that\nthese relations relate. Importantly, we might get different answers\ndepending on which view about these natures is correct (see Wilson\n2016: 200ff.). \nThis concludes our discussion of the different ways to understand\nabsolute fundamentality. We will now move on to discuss a variety of\nimportant views that are often expressed in terms of fundamentality,\nputting the notion into use. \nAs we noted in the very beginning of this entry, one of the two key\ntasks for the notion of fundamentality is to capture the idea that\nthere is a foundation of being and that everything else depends on the\nfundamental entities. This idea about fundamentality is often\nexpressed in terms of well-foundedness (Morganti 2009: 272;\nOrilia 2009: 333; Fine 2010: 100; Schaffer 2010a: 37; Bennett 2011a:\n30; Bliss 2013: 416; Trogdon 2013: 108; Tahko 2014: 260; Raven 2016:\n614; Bohn 2018; Jago 2018). But the notion of well-foundedness itself\nis sometimes used without much further qualification, and there are\nmany instances where another term is used instead for what is clearly\nthe same general idea (e.g., Lowe 1998: 158; R. Cameron 2008; Paseau\n2010; Rosen 2010). A common formulation of this general idea is as\nfollows: a priority/dependence chain is well-founded if and only if it\nterminates, i.e., has an end constituted by one or more\nentities that do not depend on any other entity. But not all the\nabove-mentioned authors would be happy with this particular\nformulation, and it turns out that sometimes philosophers may even\nhave talked past each other due to having slightly different\nformulations of well-foundedness in mind. Fortunately, the literature\nhas matured, and we now have a number of much more precise accounts of\nthe various potential formulations of well-foundedness (see especially\nDixon 2016; Rabin & Rabern 2016; Litland 2016b; Wigglesworth\n2018). \nLet’s start with the origin of the term\n“well-foundedness”. The term is familiar from mathematics,\nespecially set theory; no doubt it was adopted from set theory with\nthe hope of making the metaphysical idea more precise. A simple\nformulation of set-theoretic well-foundedness can be found in Cotnoir\nand Bacon (2012: 187):  \nAn order < on a domain is said to be wellfounded if every\nnonempty subset of that domain has a <-minimal element.  \nThe first thing to notice here is that well-foundedness is relativized\nto a giver order, a given relation of dependence, just like\n (RI)\n in\n section 1.2.\n So, strictly speaking, we ought to specify which relation we have in\nmind and consider the various complications that this introduces,\nwhich we discussed in\n section 1.\n However, much of the literature on well-foundedness (although not all\nof it) focuses on grounding, and for purposes of exposition it is\neasiest to focus on this literature, also assuming that grounding\nestablishes an absolute order of priority. \nThe set-theoretic formulation of well-foundedness is the sense in\nwhich, e.g., Fine (2010: 100) appears to use the notion. Applied to\nchains of grounding, the proposal is that well-foundedness would rule\nout infinite, non-terminating grounding chains and entail that\n“the grounds of any truth that is grounded will “bottom\nout” in truths that are ungrounded”. We can see slightly\ndifferent but equivalent formulations in Schaffer (2010a, 37), Bennett\n(2011a, 30), Trogdon (2013: 108), Tahko (2014: 260), Dixon (2016:\n452), and Jago\n (2018).[20]\n As Dixon (ibid.) puts it, the attraction of using the set-theoretic\nnotion of well-foundedness is that it is a straightforward application\nof the standard mathematical definition of a well-founded relation\n(this is also recognized by Morganti 2015: 556fn2). The only problem\nis that the standard understanding of well-foundedness may be too\nstrict for the task at hand. Many authors have considered weakened\nversions of the well-foundedness requirement, which may be more\nsuitable for expressing the desired limits on infinite grounding\nchains (R. Cameron 2008: 4; Trogdon 2013: 108; Leuenberger 2014:\n170–171). So, to summarize, it might at first seem intuitive to\ninterpret well-foundedness simply as a ban on infinite chains and\ncycles of grounding, in accordance with set-theoretic\nwell-foundedness. But this would seem to go against the intuition that\nthere are cases of infinite chaining which are acceptable for the\nfoundationalist metaphysician (R. Cameron 2008; Bliss 2013). This has\nrecently been made explicit by Dixon (2016) and Rabin & Rabern\n (2016).[21] \nTo get us started on the idea that foundationalist metaphysicians\ncould accept violations of well-foundedness, consider an important\nobservation by Bliss (2013: 416), which also comes up, e.g., in Rabin\n& Rabern (2016: 362). She distinguishes between finite and\nwell-founded grounding chains where a finite grounding chain not only\nterminates in something fundamental, but is also such that we can\nreach the fundamental entities in a finite number of steps from\nanywhere in the chain. According to this approach, a well-founded\ngrounding chain is indeed one that is grounded in something\nfundamental, but it may itself be infinitely long. So, on this\nterminology, finite grounding chains are always well-founded, but a\nwell-founded grounding chain could be infinite. But note that this\nalready violates set-theoretic well-foundedness as defined above. To\ndemonstrate this, consider an infinite chain of dependence \\(f <\n\\ldots d_{3} < d_{2} < d_{1}\\), where the chain of dependent\nentities \\(d_{n}\\) terminates in some minimal element f. Now,\nif we take a subset of that chain of dependence without the minimal\nelement f, then we are left with a chain that lacks a\n<-minimal element, hence violating the set-theoretic definition of\nwell-foundedness. \nTo get clearer on what is at issue here, let us introduce another\nnotion, being “bounded from below” or “having a\nlower bound”. We can say that an order < on a domain is\nbounded from below if any subset of that domain has a lower bound.\nMore precisely, a lower bound of a given set is any element that is\nmore minimal or equal to all of the elements of the set. For example,\n1, 2, and 3 are all lower bounds of the interval [3, 4, 5]. A lower\nbound of a set does not need to be an element of the set itself.\nConsequently, the chain \\(f < \\ldots d_{3} < d_{2} < d_{1}\\),\nis bounded from below. More generally, any finite chain is\nset-theoretically well-founded and bounded from below. We’ve\njust seen that some infinitely descending chains of dependence may be\nbounded from below yet fail to be set-theoretically well-founded. As\nRabin & Rabern (2016: 360) put it, an infinitely descending chain\nmay or may not have a “limit”, where limit is the greatest\nlower bound of a set. In the previous example, 3 is the greatest lower\nbound of the interval [3, 4, 5]. So, one might suggest that the\nrelevant sense of metaphysical well-foundedness is captured either by\nthis idea of being bounded from below or by having a limit, a greatest\nlower bound. But it turns out that even these may be too strong. This\nis the key insight in the recent work of Dixon and Rabin & Rabern.\nIf this is right, then we need to have a sense of a metaphysical\nfoundation that is not only compatible with infinite chains of\ndependence, but also with infinite chains that do not have a lower\nbound (i.e., “unbounded”\n chains).[22] \nIt might be helpful to present a somewhat simplified example of a case\nwhere well-foundedness and being bounded from below come apart. Let us\nuse a variation of Trogdon’s (2018b) reconstruction of an\nexample by Rabin & Rabern (2016: 361; this is an example of what\nDixon 2016: 448 calls a “fully pedestalled chain”).\nConsider a spherical region of space S, which we divide up in\nsuch a way that each of the proper sub-regions of S has a\nproper sub-region, and each of those sub-regions in turn has a proper\nsub-region. In principle, we can continue this process infinitely.\nNow, let us assume that each region of space derives its being in part\nfrom (or is partially grounded in) its sub-regions. Here we would seem\nto have an infinite regress where, to use the familiar phrase, being\nis forever deferred, never achieved. But suppose in addition that\nthere are spatial points and that these points are fundamental. Then\nwe might like to say that S and indeed each of its infinitely\nmany proper sub-regions fully derives its being from (or is fully\ngrounded in) spatial points. In this case, the infinite regress of the\nsub-regions would appear to be innocuous since each of them is after\nall fully accounted for by the fundamental spatial points. It is worth\nnoting that this example relies on overdetermination since the\nsub-regions are here thought to derive their being partially from\ntheir proper sub-regions and fully from the spatial points. Still, the\ncase for a sense of fundamentality that is compatible with at least\nsome kind of non-well-founded infinite descent or other seems to have\nbeen made sufficiently clear in recent work. Metaphysical\nfoundationalism does not seem to be properly captured by the idea of\nset-theoretic well-foundedness. So, what is it about? \nWe can find numerous formally precise attempts to capture the relevant\nsense of a metaphysical foundation in recent work. Dixon’s\n(2016: 446) preferred understanding (which he calls “full\nfoundations”) suggests that every non-fundamental fact is fully\ngrounded by some fundamental fact(s). Rabin & Rabern (2016: 363)\nattempt to capture the idea of a metaphysical foundation with the\nphrase “having a foundation”, whereby a grounding\nstructure has a foundation if and only if there is some set of facts\nthat (i) together ground all the derivative facts and (ii) are\nthemselves ungrounded. Raven suggests (2016: 612) that metaphysical\nfoundationalism could be understood in terms of\nineliminability (to be discussed in\n section 3).\n Tahko (2014: 263) tries to analyze metaphysical foundationalism in\nterms of an “ontological” sense of well-foundedness, which\nrequires that an ontologically well-founded chain terminates in a\nfundamental supervenience base. Trogdon (2018b) follows the recent\nsuggestions for a weaker understanding of metaphysical foundationalism\nand defines it as the view that, necessarily, any non-fundamental\nentity is fully grounded by fundamental entities. Even though the\nterminology varies, it’s quite clear that there are weaker\nsenses of metaphysical foundationalism than the one defined in terms\nof set-theoretic well-foundedness. We arrive at the following\ndefinition of metaphysical foundationalism: \nThis definition of metaphysical foundationalism is somewhat vague\nsince it attempts to capture the idea for all the different varieties\nof fundamentality that we have discussed, but it may be supplemented\nwith an appropriate restriction on the type of entities it concerns\n(e.g., facts) and the subscripts \\(D_{1}\\), \\(D_{2}\\) …\n\\(D_{N}\\) may be replaced with one’s preferred kind or kinds of\ndependence, exactly as with the schemas proposed in\n (AI)\n and\n (RI)\n in\n section 1.\n Furthermore, we need to understand “fully account for”\ncorrespondingly, for instance, in the case of grounding it should be\nparsed as “fully grounds” and in the case of compositional\ndependence it should be parsed as “fully composes” (albeit\nin some cases it may not be entirely clear that a full/partial\ndistinction properly applies). Now that we have a working notion of\nmetaphysical foundationalism, we may proceed to discuss arguments in\nfavor and against this view. \nMetaphysical foundationalism is the view that reality has a\nfoundation—that there is a “fundamental level”, in a\nsense that needs to be specified. The most common way to specify the\nidea of having a foundation is in terms of well-foundedness, but as we\nhave seen in\n section 2,\n set-theoretical well-foundedness may be too strong to capture\nmetaphysical foundationalism. Metaphysical foundationalism comes in a\nvariety of strengths, depending on how much the well-foundedness\nrequirement is weakened. It seems reasonable to say that until quite\nrecently metaphysical foundationalism was the default position (R.\nCameron 2008; Schaffer 2009; 2010a; Bennett 2011a). The relevant\nintuition is often captured with the much-cited phrase that without a\nfoundation, “a ground of being”, “[b]eing would be\ninfinitely deferred, never achieved” (Schaffer 2009: 376; 2010a,\n62). \nSometimes the foundationalist intuition is explicitly tied to\ncomposition (i.e., mereological dependence) and the (im)possibility of\ngunk, namely, the idea that everything has a proper part:\n“the anti-gunk worry is that composition could never have got\noff the ground” (R. Cameron 2008: 6). The worry is that complex\nobjects are not possible in gunky worlds, so given that there is\ncomposition, there must be a foundation. However, we’ve seen\nthat fundamentality need not be tied to compositional/mereological\ndependence. Moreover, others (McKenzie 2011; Bliss 2013; Tahko 2014;\nMorganti 2014, 2018; Bohn 2018; Trogdon 2018b) have been suspicious of\nthe driving intuition behind this sense of metaphysical\nfoundationalism, and now even some of those who have earlier defended\nmetaphysical foundationalism opt for agnosticism on the question\n(Bennett 2017: 120ff; Rosen 2010: 116). Indeed, there is, perhaps, now\na consensus that it is very difficult to come up with a proper\nargument in favor of metaphysical foundationalism, something that\nwould go beyond the just stated intuition. The idea has a status\ncloser to a type of metaphysical axiom or law as\nBohn (2018) puts it (see Morganti 2018 for a good overview). This\nconclusion seems even more warranted given that defining metaphysical\nfoundationalism simply in terms of set-theoretical well-foundedness\nturned out to be too strict. To establish a clearer sense of\nmetaphysical foundationalism which is in accordance with the most\nrecent literature, we shall understand “metaphysical\nfoundationalism” as it was defined in\n section 2\n (MF). \nCan we be clearer on the core idea of metaphysical foundationalism? If\nwe can, then perhaps potential arguments for the view would also be\nmore easily available. One interesting attempt to do so is\n Raven’s.[23]\n Raven’s version of metaphysical foundationalism relies on the\nnotions of “eliminability” and\n“ineliminability” whereby an entity is eliminable if\nreality is described no worse without mentioning it and ineliminable\nif reality cannot be completely described without mentioning it. This\nseems to come close to fundamentality characterized in terms of a\ncomplete minimal basis\n (CMB),\n discussed in\n section 1.3.\n To demonstrate this, let us take advantage of Raven’s own\nterminology (2016: 614–5). Ineliminable entities\n“persist” in some fact about them, whereas eliminables\n“disappear” from all facts about them. For an entity to\n“disappear” is for there to be a bound in the grounds of\nsome fact about it, a last occurrence of it after which the entity\nnever recurs. So, for an entity to persist is for some facts about it\nto be unbounded. Importantly, there are two ways to be unbounded:\nbeing ungrounded or having grounds but forever recurring. The first\ntype of persistence is the familiar sense of relative independence\n (RI)\n as defined in\n section 1.2.\n But the second type of persistence, where an entity forever recurs in\nthe chain of dependence, is\n novel.[24] \nA potentially helpful way to illustrate the options available to us\nand clarify the relationship between metaphysical foundationalism and\ninfinite descent is Morganti’s (2015: 562) “emergence\nmodel of being”. This model may be contrasted with the\n“transmission model”, which is, perhaps, what the\nmuch-quoted phrase from Schaffer that we led with reflects. According\nto the transmission model, the ungrounded entities are the\n“ground of being”. But the emergence model suggests that\nsomething may act as a foundation in the absence of ungrounded\nentities; the infinite “starts playing an active role, and\nprogress is made as the chain lengthens” (Morganti 2015: 562).\nThe emergence model draws inspiration from an analogy with\nepistemology where the “emergence of justification” from\nan infinite chain of reasons has recently been an area of active\nresearch (Klein 2007; Peijnenburg & Atkinson 2013). Thus, the core\nof the emergence model seems to be that there is no privileged\nfundamental level of reality that serves as the basis for being.\nInstead, we should understand being more holistically, as it were, and\nexplore the idea that it may emerge gradually. Let us call this\nemergentist infinitism. On the face of it, emergentist\ninfinitism looks like the denial of\n (MF)\n and hence metaphysical foundationalism. However, there is some room\nfor interpretation here, because the holistic model suggests that the\nwhole infinite chain could perhaps be considered to ground its\n“parts”. \nWe might compare this line of thinking to Leibniz’s\nprinciple of sufficient reason (PSR), which states that for\nevery entity that exists, there is an explanation or reason for its\nexistence (Della Rocca 2010; Guigon 2015; Dasgupta 2016; and the\nseparate entry on\n principle of sufficient reason).\n In the contemporary literature, we may compare (PSR) with the\ninheritance principle discussed in Schaffer (2016b) and Trogdon\n(2018b). An open question, although not one that we will pursue here,\nis whether emergentist infinitism is compatible with (PSR). \nTo conclude this section, it should be noted that not all the views\ndiscussed above have been put forward under the label of metaphysical\nfoundationalism. But once it is made clear that the foundationalist\nidea is not tied to the strong, set-theoretic sense of\nwell-foundedness, the requirement for a foundation is much weaker than\nit may once have seemed. If we broaden the scope of metaphysical\nfoundationalism accordingly, is there still an interesting sense of\nmetaphysical infinitism to be discussed? \nTo endorse metaphysical infinitism is to reject metaphysical\nfoundationalism\n (MF).\n But as we’ve seen, the sense of metaphysical foundationalism\ndefined at the end of\n section 2\n does not require accepting strong, set-theoretic well-foundedness,\nand hence it is compatible with at least some types of infinite\ndescent. Accordingly, metaphysical infinitism is a somewhat stronger\nview than it may first have seemed. \nUsing the technical notion of being bounded from below or having a\nlower bound introduced in\n section 2,\n we can start with the simple idea that, for a given notion of\ndependence, a chain has a lower bound only if there is an element that\nevery element in the chain depends on (Rabin & Rabern 2016: 366).\nAs we saw earlier, infinitely descending chains of dependence may have\na lower bound, that is, terminate in an independent element that may\nor may not be part of the chain itself, yet fail to be\nset-theoretically well-founded. But there is an even weaker condition\nthan having a lower bound that can satisfy\n (MF),\n namely, Rabin & Rabern’s (2016: 363) “having a\nfoundation” or Dixon’s (2016: 446) equivalent “full\nfoundations”. Both of these are based on the idea of having an\ninfinitely large foundation. An example of this type of foundation can\nbe constructed with the help of infinitary disjunctions, as both Rabin\n& Rabern and Dixon demonstrate (Litland 2016b discusses the\nproblems associated with this and constructs further examples). In\nsuch a case, (MF) is satisfied because every element depends on some\nindependent element, despite there being no lower bound. There is no\nlower bound because the chain does not terminate if the foundation is\ninfinitely large. In contrast, if the foundation is finite, then the\nthere is a lower bound and hence the weaker requirement of (MF) is\nalso entailed. In decreasing order of strength, we have the\nrequirement of set-theoretical well-foundedness, having a lower bound,\nand having a foundation or full foundations. We defined (MF) in terms\nof the weakest of these three requirements in\n section 2,\n but a proponent of metaphysical foundationalism may of course make a\nstronger requirement as well, such as having a lower bound. \nIn this section, we are interested in the possibility of the type of\nstrong metaphysical infinitism that denies all of the three\nrequirements. The denial of\n (MF)\n entails that there are at least some entities that are\nnon-fundamental yet do not depend for their being on any fundamental\nentity or entities. There may be several ways in which this could\nhappen, but the most extreme possibility is a type of infinite\ncomplexity whereby there is an infinite descent of different\nkinds of entities, each depending on entities further down the chain\nbut never terminating and never being “fully accounted\nfor”. We might think of this in terms of a violation of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason (PSR), at least if (PSR) is thought to\nrequire that we must reach an ultimate reason rather than just a\nreason at each layer below the previous one. Accordingly, infinite\ncomplexity entails a lack of structure with the type of explanatory\nimport that (PSR) requires. This type of view would be more radical\nthan the various, potentially innocuous types of infinite descent\noutlined so far. The view might strike many as implausible, at least\nwhen it comes to the actual\n world.[25] \nInfinite complexity is a strong version of metaphysical infinitism,\nbut what if, instead of infinite complexity, we had some kind of\ninfinite repetition? This type of idea has been discussed under the\nlabel of boring infinite descent (Schaffer 2003: 505, 510;\nTahko 2014). A boring or repetitive structure entails that somewhere\ndown the chain of dependence we stop encountering novel types of\nentities or novel structure. The boring part of the structure that\nrepeats infinitely could be of any length as long as it starts anew\neventually. A description of the repetitive part only needs to be\nsupplemented with an instruction to continue as before. For example:\n \nThe world stands on four elephants, the four elephants stand on a\nturtle, the turtle stands on two camels, the camels stand on four\nelephants, the four elephants stand on a turtle … and repeat ad\ninfinitum. (Tahko 2014: 261)  \nThe idea is that the boring structure, whatever shape it may take, can\nbe fully described in terms of the mentioned entities (or types of\nentities, and perhaps the “standing” relations between\nthem): four elephants, a turtle, and two camels. It has been suggested\nthat this produces a “minimal” description of reality, but\nit is debatable whether it satisfies\n (MF)\n or is a case of strong metaphysical infinitism (Raven 2016; Tahko\n2018). \nIt seems that this type of infinite descent is less radical than\ninfinite complexity, but some open questions remain. For instance, is\nthe type of infinite regress at hand innocuous or vicious? Can we\ncapture the difference between metaphysical foundationalism and\nmetaphysical infinitism in terms of the non-viciousness or viciousness\nof the regress (Nolan 2001; Bliss 2013)? We will leave these issues\nopen, but to improve on the toy example, we might briefly discuss a\nmore concrete case. Sometimes the Nobel Prize winner Hans\nDehmelt’s (1989) model is mentioned as a potential example\n(Schaffer 2003, Morganti 2014, Tahko 2014). Dehmelt speculated that\nthere could be a quark/lepton substructure beyond the known level of\nquarks, based on the model of the triton, the nucleus of\nhydrogen’s radioactive isotope tritium:  \nI propose to extend the triton substructure scheme to an infinite\nnumber of layers. Below the four layers listed above [up to\nsubquarks], they contain higher order \\(d_N\\) subquarks, with \\(N = 5\n\\rightarrow \\infty\\). In each layer the particles are not identical\nbut resemble each other in the same way as quarks and leptons do, with\nmasses varying as much as a factor 108. In an infinite regression to\nsimpler particles of ever increasing mass, they asymptotically\napproach Dirac point particles. (Dehmelt 1989: 8618)  \nUp to \\(N = 3\\), the level of electrons, Dehmelt’s model is\nmotivated by current physics, but it is speculative from \\(N = 4\\)\nonwards, where electron substructure is postulated. However,\nit’s not entirely clear whether Dehmelt’s model is a\ngenuine case of boring infinite descent, given that the regress\nappears to terminate in Dirac point\n particles.[26] \nA final argument to be considered in this section challenges the\n“transmission model”, whereby derivative entities derive\ntheir “being” from the fundamental entities. Bohn (2018:\n170) makes a helpful observation, aimed against the transmission model\n(applied to grounding):  \nGrounding is like a synchronic, static mathematical relation (like in\narithmetic), not like a diachronic, dynamic physical relation (like in\nthermodynamics, or action theory).  \nThe thought here is that the transmission model illegitimately assumes\na dynamical “starting point” to any grounding chain. If we\nabandon the transmission model and the dynamical view, we arrive at\nthe idea of indefinitely descending ground whereby all facts\nhave a ground and hence there are no fundamental facts (Bohn 2018).\nThis violates even the weakest of the three requirements that a\nmetaphysical foundationalist might impose, so it is a strict denial of\n (MF).\n Note, however, that this concerns only the precisification of (MF) in\nterms of grounding. So, this type of metaphysical infinitism targets\nthe conception of fundamentality as ungroundedness (as specified in\nterms of\n (RI)\n in\n section 1.2). \nIf\n (MF)\n does not require the transmission model, the choice between\nfoundationalism and infinitism is difficult. There is, perhaps, one\ntest case: the possibility of gunk (everything has a proper\npart), junk (everything is a proper part), and hunk\n(everything both is and has a proper part). There is an on-going\ndebate about the modal status of these scenarios, and one might appeal\nto their possibility in defense of indefinitely descending ground (as\nBohn 2018\n does).[27]\n However, these scenarios of course concern only the relation of\nproper parthood (mereological dependence), and hence even if\nmereological infinitism were coherent, there may be other notions of\ndependence for which the corresponding notion of infinitism is\nincoherent. \nThis concludes our discussion of metaphysical infinitism and\nfundamentality. This survey has focused on a subset of the growing\nliterature on fundamentality with the aim of clarifying the various\nterminological issues surrounding the key notions and identifying some\ncommon themes. The ideas behind these notions are old as are the\nintuitions associated with the various arguments that we’ve seen\nfor and against metaphysical foundationalism and infinitism. Recent\nhelpful efforts to systematize some of the central ideas, especially\nthat of well-foundedness, have made it much easier to have\nconstructive discussions about the topic of fundamentality. It can be\nexpected that further attempts to formulate arguments for and against\ndifferent strengths of metaphysical foundationalism and infinitism\nwill emerge in the near future.","contact.mail":"tuomas.tahko@bristol.ac.uk","contact.domain":"bristol.ac.uk"}]
