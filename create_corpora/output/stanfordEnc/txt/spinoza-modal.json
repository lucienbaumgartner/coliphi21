From\nSpinoza’s contemporaries to our own, readers of the Ethics\nhave denounced Spinoza’s views on modality as metaphysically confused\nat best, ethically nihilistic at\n worst.[1]\nHowever, expressing matters this way implies that there is a consensus\nabout Spinoza’s metaphysics of modality and that interpreters differ\nonly to the extent to which they distance themselves from his\noutrageous position. A cursory reading of certain passages\nof the Ethics supports the belief that, if Spinoza is clear\nanywhere, it is surely in his views of necessity and contingency. After\nall, this is the philosopher who claims that “in nature there is\nnothing contingent, but all things have been determined from the\nnecessity of the divine nature to exist and produce an effect in a\ncertain way” (Ip29) and that “things could have been\nproduced by God in no other way, and in no other order than they have\nbeen produced” (Ip33). Passages such as these suggest that\nSpinoza was a necessitarian, according to whom falsity and\nimpossibility are co-extensive. The actual world, we might now say, is\nthe only possible world. Events could not, in the strongest\nsense of that expression, have gone any differently than they in fact\nhave gone.\n\n\nAnd yet, such a picture of the interpretive landscape would be quite\nmisleading. Spinoza studies have seen a renaissance of interest in his\nviews on modality, spawning in recent years many articles and chapters\ndevoted to his modal views. From this boon of research and interest\n(relative to Spinoza studies), considerable disagreement has emerged\nabout Spinoza’s modal commitments. Much of this disagreement stems from\nlarger interpretive disagreements about Spinoza’s metaphysics. By examining Spinoza’s views on modality, we will also explore several\nof his most central metaphysical views.\n\n\nAfter a brief introduction, this entry begins with Spinoza’s\nviews on the distribution of modal properties (section 2). With respect to\nsubstances (2.1), Spinoza claims that every possible substance\nnecessarily exists. Spinoza’s argument for this conclusion is\npart of his larger argument for substance monism—the view that\nonly one substance exists, God. Spinoza’s view about the modal\nstatus of modes, his other main ontological category, is far\nmore controversial (2.2). Explaining this controversy leads into the\nheart of Spinoza’s metaphysics and involves his views on causation,\ninherence, God, ontological plenitude and the principle of sufficient\nreason. Although the question of whether Spinoza was a necessitarian is\nthe predominant topic of discussion in the recent secondary literature\non Spinoza’s modal views, Spinoza also sketches interesting\naccounts of the nature of modality (section 3) and the ground of modality (section 4)\nthat shed fresh light on his modal commitments. Though understudied by\nrecent interpreters, these topics were of interest to Spinoza’s\npeers and remain vibrant research questions in contemporary metaphysics\nof modality.\n\n\n\nSpinoza’s list of the basic types of existing things is\n exceedingly short: substances and modes\n (Ip4d).[2]\nSpinoza gives two extremely different, but equally striking accounts of\nhow many tokens exist under each of these two basic types. There is\nonly one existing substance, God, and there are infinitely many modes.\nWithout yet unpacking these claims, we might ask Spinoza, “But\ncould there have been more substances or fewer modes\nthan there in fact are?” Or, keeping the number of tokens fixed,\n“Could there have been a different substance or\ndifferent modes than the ones that in fact exist?”\nSurprisingly, Spinoza seems inclined to answer no to these questions.\nIf so, then Spinoza thinks the actual world is the only possible world.\nThis is the position of necessitarianism, a belief that few in\nthe history of Western philosophy have explicitly embraced. And for\ngood reason — on the face of it, necessaritianism is highly\ncounterintuitive. Surely the world could have gone slightly differently\nthan it has gone. Couldn’t the Allies have lost WWII? Couldn’t a leaf\nhave landed an eighth of a centimeter farther to the right than it in\nfact landed? Similarly, surely the world could have contained different\nindividuals in different numbers than it in fact contains. Couldn’t\nLeibniz have had a sister or not been born at all? \nSpinoza was aware of how deeply against the grain of common sense\nthe truth of necessitarianism would run. If he nonetheless believed in\nits truth, he must have thought he had very compelling reasons for\ndoing so. What might such reasons be? We will begin with substance\nnecessitarianism (2.1) and then turn to the necessity of modes (2.2).\nAlthough the case for interpreting Spinoza as a mode necessitarian is\nstrong, there are also Spinoza-friendly reasons for resisting such a\nreading. Seeing this tension will lead us into the middle of an\ninterpretive controversy that has ramifications for understanding many\nof Spinoza’s other central metaphysical views. (In section 2, we will\nundercover one possible way of reconciling Spinoza’s drive towards\nnecessitarianism with what might have been equally important reasons\nfor avoiding it.) \n\nIn the case of substances, Spinoza claims that every existing\nsubstance necessarily exists (Ip7d). No existing substance could have\nfailed to exist. He also claims that only one substance, namely God,\nactually exists and that only this one substance could have\nexisted (Ip14). Putting these claims together, Spinoza believes that\nevery possible substance necessarily exists. Since God is the only\npossible substance, it is impossible for any other substance besides\nGod to exist. \nSpinoza’s argument for these conclusions can be divided into two\nmajor stages: \n\nLet us consider Spinoza’s reasoning for each of these steps in turn,\nas doing so will help us understand some of Spinoza’s most important\nand basic metaphysical commitments. \nIn arguing for (1), Spinoza relies on two implicit and related\npremises. One is the\n principle of sufficient reason\n(PSR) and the other involves his account of\ncausation. Put roughly, the PSR states that every fact has a reason for\nobtaining; in slogan form, there are no brute facts. Most\nrelevantly for our purposes, if something existed for no reason at all,\nthe fact that it exists would be inexplicable, a violation for the PSR.\nAnd for parallel reasons, if something did not exist and there was no\nreason for its non-existence, the fact of its non-existence would also\nbe a violation of the PSR. As Spinoza puts it, “For each thing\nthere must be assigned a cause or reason, both for its existence [if it\nexists] and for its non-existence [if it does not exist]. For example,\nif a triangle exists, there must be a reason or cause why it exists;\nbut if it does not exist, there must also be a reason or cause which\nprevents it from existing, or which takes its existence away”\n(Ip11d). Thus, according to the PSR, there must be reasons why each\nexisting substance exists and also reasons why non-existing substances\ndo not exist. \nThe second implicit premise of Spinoza’s argument for the claim that\nall possible substances necessarily exist is that causes\nprovide (or just are) necessary and sufficient explanatory reasons. This\nidea appears in the previously quoted passage in which Spinoza claims\nthat citing a “cause or reason” suffices for explaining\nfacts about the existence and non-existence of a triangular object.\nApplied to the case of substance, the sufficient reason for why a\nsubstance exists is supplied by the causes of that substance. \nWhy does Spinoza think that an account of an object’s causes\nexplains that object’s existence? His most revealing answer traces back\nto the PSR as well. Because facts about the nature of causation are\nthemselves facts, by the PSR, facts about causation require\nexplanation. In a case in which x causes y, the PSR\ndemands an explanation of what it is in virtue of which the causal\nrelation between x and y obtains. Although one may\ntry to answer this question by appealing to other causes (say,\nz’s causing x to cause y), the PSR\nalso demands an account of what it is in virtue of which x and\ny are causally related, as opposed to being merely\nsequentially ordered (or an account of why mere sequential ordering is\nsufficient for causal relatedness). That is, the PSR applies not only\nto facts about existence, but also to facts about relations between\nexistents. (This point will be extremely important for correctly\nunderstanding Spinoza’s modal theory in section 2 below.) The PSR asks\nnot only for an explanation of the fact that x causes\ny in terms of prior first-order causes, but also for an\nexplanation of why there is a causal relation of dependence\nbetween x and y and why it is not some other kind of\nrelation. As it would not get us very far to answer by appealing to yet\nfurther first-order causal relations, the PSR is really asking us to\ngive an account of causation itself. Causation, if the PSR is true,\ncannot be a primitive metaphysical relation. So, to echo a question\nthat lingers today, just what is causation? (For more on the\ncontemporary discussion, see the entry on the\n metaphysics of causation.\nFor more on the PSR and causation, see Della Rocca (2010)). \nUnsurprisingly, Spinoza does not treat causation as a metaphysical\nprimitive. Instead, he provides an account of causation in terms of\nsomething else. In Id1, Spinoza defines self-causation (causa\nsui) as “that whose essence involves existence or\n[sive] that whose nature cannot be conceived except as\nexisting.” (Spinoza’s sive should not be read in a\ndisjunctive sense, nor is it usually stating a mere equivalence. What\nfollows the “or” is often a fuller account of what precedes\nit. Think of it as an “or better yet…”) Expanding\nhis definition to cover causation in general, Spinoza’s idea is that\ncausation is a matter of “involvement” or conceptual\nconnection. If x causes y, this fact obtains in\nvirtue of a conceptual connection between the concept of x and\nthe concept of\n y.[3]\nSpinoza frequently suggests that the conceiving through\nrelation is the paradigm of explanation (e.g., Iax5, IIp5, IIp7s). If\nso, then we can understand why Spinoza thinks causes serve as\nsufficient explanatory reasons for facts about existence. If causal\nrelations are conceptual relations, and if conceptual relations are\nparadigms of explanation, then to give an account of an object’s\nexistence in terms of its causes is to explain the fact that it exists\nin just the way the PSR demands. \nLet us apply this point to the case of substances. Spinoza reasons\nthat existing substances exist in virtue of having causes that bring\nabout and explain their existence, and non-existing substances do not\nexist in virtue of causes that prevent their existence and explain\ntheir non-existence (Ip14). According to Spinoza’s account of\ncausation, this means that existing substances exist in virtue of\nconceptual relations to whatever explains their existence, and,\nsimilarly, conceptual relations explain the non-existence of\nnon-existing substances. What causes or explains the existence or\nnon-existence of a substance? \nSpinoza argues that substances are conceptually, and hence causally,\nisolated from one another (Ip2–Ip5). He infers from this that\nsubstances cannot be caused to exist or be prevented from existing by\nany other substance (Ip6). But since all existing substances must\nnonetheless have causes and reasons for their existence, the fact that\na substance exists must be explained entirely by the substance itself.\nThat is, all existing substances must be self-caused and hence\nself-explained (Ip7). For parallel reasons, the non-existence of a\nnon-existing substance must be explained solely through facts about the\nnon-existing substance. Spinoza infers that the concepts of\nnon-existing substances must include the explanation for their own\nnon-existence. What about the concept of a non-existing substance could\nexplain that substance’s non-existence? Spinoza’s answer: a\nself-contradiction. Non-existing substances do not exist for the same\nreason that squared circles do not exist in Euclidean space: they are\nconceptually impossible (Ip11d). From the fact of non-existence plus\nthe PSR, Spinoza concludes that non-existing substances do not exist\nbecause it is impossible for them to exist. They cannot cause\nthemselves to exist because their very concepts contain a\ncontradiction, and facts about causation track facts about conceptual\ninvolvement and explanation. \nSo, returning to our opening questions, could there have been more\nsubstances than there in fact are? Spinoza’s answer is no, which means\nthat there are no merely possible substances. A substance\neither exists or its existence is impossible. Could an existing\nsubstance have failed to exist? Again, Spinoza’s answer is no, since\nthe only available explanatory basis for its possible non-existence\nwould be facts about the substance itself. But if an existing substance\nis completely causally isolated, what could bring about its\nnon-existence? Only itself, Spinoza answers, which would again amount\nto the concept of that substance containing an internal contradiction\nthat would prevent such a substance from existing in the first place\n(Ip7). Could an existing substance exist for a certain length of time\nand then go out of existence? Spinoza’s answer is again no, since that\nwould mean that an existing substance causes its own self-destruction,\na violation of Spinoza’s doctrine that “No thing can be destroyed\nexcept through an external cause” (IIIp4). In reaching all of\nthese conclusions, Spinoza relies on the self-explaining or\nself-causing nature of substances and the explanatory demands of the\nPSR. Spinoza concludes that for any existing substance, it could not\nhave failed to exist nor can it cease to exist. Hence, if a substance\nexists, it necessarily exists (Ip7d). On the other hand, if a substance\ndoes not exist, its existence is impossible. Combining these\nconclusions, we reach (1): every possible substance necessarily\nexists. \nHere is a sketch of the main steps of this argument: \n\nThe second major stage of Spinoza’s argument is to prove that God is\nthe only possible substance. I will not here rehearse all the details\nof Spinoza’s argument to this conclusion (for two recent discussions,\nsee Lin 2007 and Della Rocca 2001). Like his argument for (1),\nSpinoza’s argument for (2) relies on the PSR. Here is one possible\nsketch of Spinoza’s overall argument for (2): \n\nOf these steps, premise (16) is the one for which Spinoza offers the\nleast explicit justification: \nThe absurdity Spinoza points to is actually the putative\nabsurdity of the non-existence of a being according to whose\nconcept it is infinite and supremely perfect. But why accept that the concept of Spinoza’s God is internally\nconsistent? If Spinoza fails to justify this assumption, his\nontological argument would fall victim to Leibniz’s complaint that even\nif otherwise successful, (pre-Leibnizian) ontological arguments prove only a hypothetical truth: if God is a\npossible substance, then God necessarily exists. Spinoza’s argument,\nabsent a justification of (16), fails to establish the possibility of\nGod before asserting the necessity of God’s existence. \nEven worse, Spinoza faces an especially thorny problem in justifying\n(16). For his account of the concept of God in (15) relies on\ncommitments that even those friendly to theism, such as Descartes,\nwould surely reject. Spinoza defines God in Id6 as “a substance\nconsisting of an infinity of attributes, of which each one expresses an\neternal and infinite essence.” Spinoza claims in Ip9, without any\nexplicit argument, “The more reality or being each thing\n[unaquaeque res] has, the more attributes belong to it.”\nThis definition of God and the supporting principle in Ip9 were\ncontroversial even in Spinoza’s own day. According to Descartes, a\nsubstance cannot have more than one (principal)\nattribute.[5]\nTo say that the concept of God is the concept of a substance with\nmultiple (principal) attributes is, in fact, to appeal to an internally\ninconsistent concept. So, the objection runs, not only has Spinoza\nfailed to justify (16), but (15) is outright false. \nSpinoza’s defense of (15) would likely be to appeal to the\nself-containment of each attribute (Della Rocca 2001). Like substance,\neach attribute is a wholly self-contained and self-sufficient way of\nconceiving substance (Ip10). Given such rigid containment, Spinoza\nwould press, how could the fact that a substance has one attribute\npreclude that substance from having additional attributes? If there are\nno explanatory or conceptual relations between the attribute of thought\nand the attribute of extension, the fact that a substance is thinking\ncannot explain why that substance could not also be extended. The lack\nof a reason for excluding an attribute is part of Spinoza’s\nreason for including all possible attributes as attributes of\nGod. However, even if he can defend the rigid self-containment of\nattributes, he will also need a positive reason for including them all\ntogether as attributes of a single substance. \nThis brings us back to Ip9 and the other objectionable aspect of\n(16). Why should perfection or reality and strength of reason to exist\ncorrespond to possessing a greater number of attributes? Spinoza does\nnot offer any explicit defense of this correlation. The demonstration\nof Ip9 simply refers readers back to the definition of an attribute\n(see also Ep9). Here is one possible way Spinoza might motivate the\ncorrelation between number of attributes and perfection / reality for\nexisting. The principle in Ip9 may be that to the extent to which a\nsingle thing [unaquaeque res] can be expressed by a\ngreater number of attributes, to that extent it is more perfect, and\nhence is more real (IId6) and has greater reason for existing (Ip11s).\nSpinoza’s emphatic “unaquaeque” may point to the idea that\nperfection involves both unity and diversity. To the degree to\nwhich one and the same thing can sustain a greater variety of\nexpressions of it, to that extent it is more perfect. The maximal\nperfection and reality of God, on this account, is partly constituted\nby the fact that God’s self-identity is compatible with a plentitude of\nincommensurable expressions – infinitely many attributes –\nof it. This view of metaphysical perfection, one which tries to\nmaximize both identity and diversity, is very similar to Leibniz’s\naccount of perfection as harmony, a principle that Leibniz\nexplains as “diversity compensated by\nidentity.”[6]\nOn this reading, God’s metaphysical perfection for Spinoza is the\nperfection of Leibniz’s most harmonious world, the perfection of\nmaintaining both the one and the many (Newlands 2010a). \nWhether or not Spinoza fully succeeds defending the consistency of\nhis concept of God, the striking modal conclusion he draws from it is\nclear: “Except God, no substance can be or be conceived”\n(Ip14). This statement captures Spinoza’s substance monism and his\nsubstance necessitarianism: there is only one possible substance, God,\nand that substance necessarily exists. \n\nImmediately after wrapping up his proof for substance monism in\nIp14, Spinoza claims in the next proposition that “Whatever is,\nis in God, and nothing can be or be conceived without God”\n(Ip15). By the definition of a mode in Id5, Ip15 implies that\neverything that exists other than God is a mode or affection of God. To\nunderstand the import of this claim, it is important to understand what\na mode is and what is it for a mode to be in a substance, for\nSpinoza. \nA natural way to think about modes is as a certain kind of property.\nThe circular shape of the coin on the desk is a mode of that\ncoin. On this reading, being circular is a state of the coin, a\nparticularized way that the coin is. Spinoza’s claim that modes\nare “in” their substances also suggests that modes\ninhere in substances akin to the way that properties inhere in\nthings, and that modes are therefore predicable of substances as\nsubjects of predication. Circularity, we might say, inheres in the coin\nand the coin is circular. Of course, there is an extremely\nwide range of views about properties and property-bearers (see the\nentry on\n properties),\nso claiming that modes are akin to properties that\ninhere in substances will not answer all questions. But even putting\naside questions about inherence, property instantiation, and\npredication relations, it may seem like Spinoza has made a colossal\nblunder in Ip15. After all, how can a table or human being be anything\nlike a property? How can I inhere in something else? What\nsense would it make to say of something — a substance —\nthat it is Sam Newlandsish in the same sense in which I say of\nit that it is round? If there is such a thing as a “category\nmistake,” this may seem like an especially clear case of\n one.[7] \nIt would be disappointing if this objection simply assumed from the\noutset that (a) objects like tables and human beings are substances and\n(b) substances neither inhere in nor are predicable of other\nsubstances. Spinoza agrees with (b), but he has already argued\npace (a) that there can be only one substance. It would be\nunfair to grant him that conclusion in Ip14 and then insist upon\nreading Ip15 that other things still ought to have all the features of\nsubstances. (Of course, these intuitive concerns may well provide\nreasons to reconsider Spinoza’s arguments for Ip14.) \nInterpreters have tried to make sense of Spinoza’s identification of\neveryday objects with modes without presupposing the denial of his\nsubstance monism. One strategy would be to deny that Spinoza intends\nanything like property, inherence and predication by his identification\nof everyday objects with modes of God. On this interpretation,\nSpinoza’s claims about modes and “in” in Ip15 are really\njust claims about the causal dependence of all things on God\n(Curley 1969). Everyday objects inhere in God in the sense that they\ndepend causally on God. When Spinoza claims, “Whatever is, is in\nGod,” he really means only that everything is causally dependent\non God, a fantastically unremarkable claim in the 17th\ncentury. Indeed, as others have objected (Bennett 1991, Carriero 1995,\nMelamed 2009), this proposal makes Spinoza’s claim in Ip15 so\nunremarkable that it is hard to see why Spinoza went to such\nobfuscating lengths to phrase his ontology in terms of modes and\ninherence in the first place, since he had the categories of efficient\ncausation and dependent beings at his disposal. Why did Spinoza bother\nto talk about inherence and immanent causation at all? \nA different strategy (Carriero 1995) preserves the inherence link\nbetween modes and properties, but understands Spinoza’s modes as\nparticularized accidents or, in contemporary terms, tropes\n(see the entry on \n tropes).\nAccording to this reading, collections of particularized\nproperties constitute everyday objects for Spinoza. However, although\nsuch bundles of tropes inhere in substance, they are not predicable of\nsubstance. Hence, although I inhere in substance, it is not the case\nthat substance is Sam Newlandsish, whatever that may mean.\nWhereas the first interpretation explained inherence as nothing but\nefficient causation, this reading tries to keep causation and inherence\nintensionally (though perhaps not extensionally) distinct metaphysical\ndependence relations. \nAnother, more circuitous option begins with a functional account of\nmodes in Spinoza’s ontology. The function of modes, according to\npassages like Ip25c, is to provide ways of expressing or conceiving the\npower of substance. Perhaps Spinoza actually provides an\nanalysis of inherence in terms of this expressive or\nconceptual relation, similar to the way in which he provides an\nanalysis of causation in terms of conceptual connection. Consider, for\ninstance, Id3, in which Spinoza defines substance as that which is\n“[a] in itself and [b] is conceived through itself, that is, [c]\nthat whose concept does not require the concept of another thing from which\nit must be formed” (the brackets are mine). Instead of leaving\ninherence as an unprincipled primitive relation of metaphysical\ndependence (pace the PSR), one could read [c] as providing an\nanalysis of both [a] and [b]. One thing inheres in another in\nvirtue of being conceived through it, which, like causation, is a\nmatter of conceptual involvement. That everyday objects are modes\ninhering in and predicated of substance is extensionally and\nintensionally equivalent to everyday objects being conceived through\nsubstance. Whereas Curley’s interpretation took\ncausation to be Spinoza’s underlying account of\ninherence, this interpretation takes conceptual involvement to\nbe Spinoza’s underlying account of both inherence and causation\n(for a recent defense, see Newlands 2010a; for dissents, see DiPoppa 2013, Melamed\n2012 and Laerke 2011). \nAlthough I will not try to settle this debate here, different\ninterpretations of Spinoza’s ontology of modes will yield\nalternative accounts of his views on the necessity of modes. For\npurposes of ease and neutrality, I will frequently refer to modes as\n“objects,” which I intend to be a neutral placeholder for\n“whatever else exists besides substance.” \n\nEarlier, I noted that Spinoza thinks infinitely many non-substantial\nobjects exist: “From the necessity of the divine nature there\nmust follow infinitely many things in infinitely many ways, i.e.,\neverything which can fall under an infinite intellect” (Ip16).\nAlthough Spinoza means more by “infinite” than simply\n“exhaustive,” he clearly intends “exhaustive”\nas well. How many objects are there? “As many as there can be\ntogether” is Spinoza’s reply. That is, Spinoza endorses a\nprinciple of ontological plenitude (POP), according to which the\ngreatest number of compossible non-substantial objects actually exists.\nPart of Spinoza’s motivation for POP may derive from the PSR itself,\nsince if the actual world were sub-maximal, non-existing but\nintrinsically possible objects would have no reason for not existing,\nwhich would be a brute fact. Perhaps it would also be an undesirable\nbrute fact if (per impossibile) a maximal world with fewer\nobjects than the actual world existed; what would explain God’s\nrealization of a smaller maximal collection when a larger maximal\ncollection is possible (see Ip33s2)? In any case, Spinoza’s POP\nimplies that the number of existing objects is necessarily fixed. \nAlthough this is already quite a strong conclusion, it does not yet\nrise to the level of full-blown necessitarianism with respect to modes.\nThere are still at least three possible sources of contingency for the maximally\nfull world of modes, each of which would be compatible with POP. Alternative possibility 1 (AP1): There could have\nbeen a different collection of modes, equal in size to the actually\nexisting collection, but with entirely different members.\nAlternative possibility 2 (AP2): For some proper subset of\nthe collection of actually existing modes, there could have been \na different, equinumerous proper subset of modes instead. Alternative possibility 3 (AP3):\nOne or more of the actual modes could have had different\ncharacteristics than it in fact has. \nTo illustrate, let the collection of shirts hanging in my closet stand for the collection of modes. Suppose that my closet could not\ncontain more or fewer shirts than it currently contains— my\ncloset is as full as it can get and I’m the sort of person who could\nnever have fewer shirts than the most that can all fit in there\ntogether. Still, couldn’t I have had an entirely different but\nequinumerous collection of shirts (AP1)? Or, keeping some of the shirts fixed, couldn’t I have had a modest blue shirt instead of the\norange plaid shirt sitting there in the middle (AP2)? Or, keeping all the shirts in the closet fixed, couldn’t the orange plaid shirt have had\na single pocket instead of having the two pockets that it actually has\n(AP3)? \nIf any of these alternatives are genuine possibilities for Spinoza,\nthen he will not be committed to full-blown necessitarianism with\nrespect to modes. Necessitarianism requires not only the necessity of\nthe number of existents; it demands the necessity of each\nmember and the necessity of all of its characteristics. Hence, even\ngiven POP and Ip16, it remains an open question whether Spinoza wants\nto deny that there are any alternative possibilities for modes. Am I\nreally stuck with the exact shirts I’ve got, double-pocketed orange\nplaid and all? \nTo understand why Spinoza might be attracted to mode\nnecessitarianism, we need to consider a few additional details of his\nontology of modes. I have been lumping modes together into a single\nontological category: everything that is not a substance. But Spinoza\nsometimes distinguishes between two types of modes, infinite modes and\nfinite modes. Unfortunately, Spinoza gives only a very sparse account\nof infinite modes in the Ethics, and he makes very few\nexplicit textual references to them outside the\n Ethics.[8]\n When Georg Schuller wrote to Spinoza to ask him for examples of\nthese curious entities, Spinoza replied with obscure gems like\n“the face of the whole universe” and “absolutely infinite intellect” (Ep64). If\nthe best elucidation of an elaborate philosophical doctrine makes\nreference to “the face of the whole universe,” that may be a\ngood sign that the doctrine needs further development. Unfortunately\nfor Spinoza’s readers, infinite modes appear to do some\nsignificant work in his metaphysics, so they cannot simply be ignored\nif one wants to understand Spinoza’s modal commitments. \n\nThe most salient feature of infinite modes is that they are more\ndirectly related to substance than finite modes are. Spinoza claims\nthat infinite modes follow more or less directly from “the\nabsolute nature of any of God’s attributes,” whereas finite modes\ndo not follow from the absolute nature of God’s attributes\n(see Ip21–22 and Ip28d). According to some interpreters, understanding\nthis distinction is the key to understanding whether or not Spinoza was\na full-blown necessitarian. \nAt first glance, Spinoza’s picture seems clear enough. (I will\ncontinue to ignore the complicating role of attributes.) Some modes\nfollow directly from the absolute nature of substance. Interpreters\nfrequently call these immediate infinite modes (Ip21). Other\nmodes follow directly from those immediate infinite modes. These are\ncommonly called mediate infinite modes (Ip22). There is then a\ngap of some kind, and on the other side of the gap is the maximally\nfull collection of finite modes. Unlike the infinite modes, particular\nfinite modes do not follow, either directly or indirectly, from the\nabsolute nature of substance. \nThe distinction between infinite and finite modes is relevant for\nSpinoza’s views on modality because of what he says about the\nmodal status of infinite modes. Spinoza reasons that if an object\nnecessarily follows from something that necessarily exists, then that\nobject also necessarily exists (Ip21). This sounds similar to a\nfamiliar and widely accepted modal axiom: (□p & □(p\n→ q)) → □q. According to this reasoning, if\nGod necessarily exists, and if the existence of a mode follows\nnecessarily from the existence and nature of God, then that mode\nnecessarily exists too. Of course, we need not and should not interpret\nSpinoza’s following-from relation as the strict logical entailment of\ncontemporary modal logic. The main point is that necessity transfers\ndown the following-from chain, according to Spinoza. If x\nnecessarily exists and if y necessarily follows from\nx, then y necessarily exists too. For ease, I will\ncall this the modal transfer principle. (Later, we will try to\ngain a better understanding of exactly why Spinoza thinks the modal\ntransfer principle works.) \nNotice that both conjuncts of the modal transfer principle\nmust be satisfied for it to apply. That is, for the modal\ntransfer principle to apply to some y, it must be the case that both (i)\ny follows necessarily from x and (ii) x\nexists necessarily. Hence, if God exists necessarily and if the existence of Bruce Springsteen follows necessarily from God’s existence, then Springsteen exists necessarily too. Whatever differences there may be between a thing that exists necessarily in virtue of its own nature and a thing that exists necessarily in virtue of following from something else that exists necessarily, that distinction is wholly internal to necessity. Differences between external and\ninternal sources of necessity, a difference to which Spinoza sometimes\ndraws attention (Ip33s), does not entail differences in type\nof necessity or even strength of necessity, and Spinoza\nnowhere says that it does.  \nSpinoza’s modal transfer principle appeals to the relation of\nfollowing-from. To a contemporary reader, this might sound like a\nrelation of logical entailment, but Spinoza clearly understands it to\nbe some kind of causal relation (e.g., Ip16c, Ip28d). This means that\nSpinoza’s following-from relation shares the features of his\ncausal relations, including the fact that causal relations involve\nnecessary connections between relata (Iax3). That is, if y\nfollows from x, then y necessarily\nfollows from x. Furthermore, Spinoza claims that\nevery mode follows from something else (Ip16 and Ip36). Therefore, every mode necessarily follows from something else, in which case condition (i) of the modal transfer principle is satisfied for every mode. This does not yet entail necessitarianism, however, for we still need to determine whether condition (ii) is universally satisfied as well. Each mode necessarily follows from something else, but does what it follows from exist necessarily?  \nIn the case of existing infinite modes, Spinoza’s\nanswer is clearly yes. In Ip22, Spinoza claims that so-called “immediate” infinite\nmodes follow from something that exists necessarily, namely substance. Therefore, by the modal transfer\nprinciple, every existing immediate infinite mode exists necessarily. Furthermore, Spinoza claims that every so-called “mediate” infinite mode follows from something that exists necessarily (namely, an immediate infinite mode), so every mediate infinite mode exists necessarily as well (Ip23). In short, because there is a chain of necessary\ndependence stretching from substance to every existing infinite mode, every existing infinite mode exists necessarily. \nOnce again, even this strong modal conclusion is not equivalent to\nfull-blown necessitarianism regarding infinite modes. Even if every\nexisting infinite mode necessarily exists, could there have\nbeen other infinite modes as well? I am not aware of any texts in which\nSpinoza explicitly rules this out, but it is easy to imagine what he\nwould say. Non-actual infinite modes do not exist necessarily, or\nelse they would actually exist, on the plausible assumption that necessity entails actuality (□p → p). So,\nfor reductio, consider a non-actual possible world, w*, that contains\nSophia, one of these extra, non-actual infinite modes. What is the manner\nof Sophia’s dependence on substance? Spinoza’s discussion of\ninfinite modes suggests that Sophia must, by definition, follow from\nGod’s absolute nature (either immediately or mediately). If so, then\nSophia follows from the absolute nature of God in w*, on the assumption\nthat true definitions express necessary truths. But in that case, the\nmodal transfer principle will apply to Sophia in w*, in which\ncase Sophia’s existence is necessary. However, again assuming that necessity entails actuality, Sophia would not be a non-actual infinite mode after all, pace our initial assumption. QED. \nOf course, that reasoning relies on possible world semantics and\nsome loaded (though plausible) theses about relations between\npossible worlds. Perhaps Spinoza could reach a similar conclusion\nwithout recourse to all that. Spinoza could instead appeal back to his\nplentitude principle and its basis in the PSR. If there could have been\nmore infinite modes than there in fact are, these non-actual, merely possible modes must\nbe compossible with the collection of necessarily existing infinite\nmodes. (Another plausible assumption, expressed loosely: if something is not compossible\nwith what necessarily exists, then its existence is not possible.) But\nif there were non-actual infinite modes that were compossible with the collection\nof necessarily existing infinite modes, what\ncould explain their non-existence? Unless an answer can be given,\nSpinoza will infer falsity from a violation of the PSR. We again reach\nthe conclusion of necessitarianism with respect to every infinite mode.\nLike substance, every possible infinite mode necessarily exists.[9] \n\nInfinite modes exist necessarily because they follow necessarily from something that exists necessarily, namely God. What about finite things like furniture and people? This much seems clear: if a finite\nmode follows from an infinite mode or from substance itself, then by the modal transfer principle, it exists necessarily too. But does any finite mode follow from an infinite\nmode or from substance? This is where the\naforementioned “gap” between infinite and finite modes\nbecomes modally significant. Consider what Spinoza says in the lengthy and\nimportant demonstration of Ip28: \nWhatever has been determined to exist and produce an effect has been\nso determined by God (by Ip26 and Ip24c). But what is finite and has a\ndeterminate existence could not have been produced by the absolute\nnature of an attribute of God; for whatever follows from the absolute\nnature of an attribute of God is eternal and infinite (Ip21). It had,\ntherefore, to follow either from God or from an attribute of God\ninsofar as it is considered to be affected by some mode….But it\nalso could not follow from God, or from an attribute of God, insofar as\nit is affected by a mode which is eternal and infinite (by Ip22). It\nhad, therefore, to follow from or be determined to exist and produce an\neffect by God insofar as it is modified by a mode which is finite and\nhas a determinate existence…and in turn, this cause or\nmode…had also to be determined by another which is also finite\nand has a determinate existence; and again…and so always (by the\nsame reasoning) to infinity. \n\nOn a cursory reading of this passage, Spinoza seems to say that no\nfinite mode follows from either an infinite mode or from “the\nabsolute nature of an attribute of God,” lest that mode be\n“eternal and infinite,” pace the nature of finite\nmodes. If so, then perhaps Spinoza’s point in this passage is\nthat particular finite modes, like the desk, follow from only\nother particular finite modes, such as a pile of wood, which themselves\nfollow from only other finite modes, such as some trees, and so\n on.[10]\nIf so, then it appears that finite modes do not follow from anything that exists necessarily, in which case the modal transfer principle will not apply. Absent some other source of necessity for finite modes, it follows that Spinoza is not a necessitarian. \nSuppose, however, that the causal history of the desk is\ntraced all the way back to the very beginning of the world. Surely the starting\npoint of the universe — that from which all the subsequent objects and events necessarily follow — surely that initial mode\nfollows from God’s nature or from one of God’s infinite modes. Where else could it come from? If so, then by the modal transfer principle, the first finite mode will exist necessarily, and so everything that follows from it, including the desk, will exist necessarily too. \nSpinoza rejects this reasoning. In the quotation from Ip28\nabove, Spinoza explicitly denies that the series of finite modes has\nan initial starting point. Spinoza thinks that the series of finite objects extends backwards in time in an infinitely long causal chain that contains no\ninitial state. For every finite cause of\nthe desk, there will always be a temporally prior finite cause of that cause. And a prior\ncause of the cause of that cause. And so on, ad infinitum. \nAd nauseam as well? Spinoza has little sympathy with the\ntraditional monotheistic idea that God created the world ex\nnihilo. There is no true “in the beginning” style\ncosmogony, according to Spinoza. If our present universe can be traced\nback to the Big Bang, there had to be a state prior to\nthe Big Bang that caused the Big Bang, and a state prior to that, and\nso on. Is this infinite chain of finite causes intelligible? Prima facie,\nthere is no PSR violation. For every particular finite object, there is\na sufficient reason for its existence and characteristics in\nterms of its prior finite causes. Each finite object follows from and\nis thus explained by the prior state of the world, whose constituents\nare explained by a yet prior state, and so on. If that is all Spinoza\nintended to say about the modal status of finite things, then one could read\nhis fiery denials of contingency as defenses of\nmere causal determinism and not full-blown necessitarianism. \n\nAn important lesson from the previous section is that if there is a causal gap between finite modes and infinite modes, then Spinoza’s modal\ntransfer principle will not apply to finite modes, since condition (ii) will remain unsatisfied in each case. Finite things will be causally determined solely by other finite things, none of which exist necessarily. \nHowever tempting, this picture has trouble making sense of Spinoza’s\nrepeated claims that everything is caused by God (Ip25–26), a\nclaim Spinoza repeats in the very first sentence of Ip28d itself.\nSpinoza frequently emphasizes that God’s power or essence is the cause\nand explanation of everything that exists (Ip16, 17, 29s, 33,\nIAppendix). But how can everything follow from God’s power, if\nfinite modes follow only from other finite modes? Won’t the alleged gap\nbetween finite and infinite modes mean that finite things do not, after\nall, follow from God or substance? And won’t that violate one of the most\nbasic features of modes, namely their dependence, qua modes, on\nsubstance (Id5)? \nThis is a notoriously difficult question facing Spinoza’s\nmetaphysics, one that was raised by Leibniz just a year after Spinoza’s\ndeath (Leibniz 1969, 203). Sometimes this worry was historically expressed as whether\nSpinoza can “derive” the finite from the infinite, but it\nis not really a question of logical deduction (Hübner 2014). How can Spinoza believe\nboth that God is the cause of all things and that finite things follow\nonly from other finite things? \nOne possible response would appeal to the close relationship between\nfinite modes and the power of God. Finite modes have only other finite\nmodes for causes, but being caused by other finite modes is a way of\nbeing determined by God’s power, since finite modes just are limited\nexpressions of God’s power (Ip36d). The success of this response\ndepends on the relationship between God and God’s modes for\nSpinoza, an interpretive point that is heavily disputed. This reply\nwould not work, for instance, if the fundamental connection between\nsubstance and modes is purely causal. \nCurley has proposed a more elaborate and elegant solution for reconciling Ip28 and the claim that all modes follow from\nsubstance without positing any closer relationship between God and\nfinite modes. (This is understandable since Curley is the leading\nadvocate of the “causal only” interpretation of how modes\ndepend on substance.) Curley suggests that Spinoza’s finite modes are\nonly partially determined by other finite modes (Curley 1969).\nThey are also partially determined by infinite modes, which Curley\nunderstands to be general features of the world described by the laws\nof nature. The desk follows partly from infinite modes and partly from\nother particular finite modes. \nIn more contemporary terms, Curley’s proposal is that every state of\nthe world is determined by the laws of nature plus the prior state of\nthe world. The laws of nature and the antecedent state each contribute\nto bringing about the desk, but neither is sufficient on its own. This division of labor would allow Spinoza to overcome\nthe problem of the gap without violating Ip28. Particular finite modes\ndo follow partly from God’s nature, in virtue of following partly from\ninfinite modes – but only partly. They also follow partly from\nother finite modes. Admittedly, Spinoza does not say in Ip28 that\nfinite modes follow only partially from other finite modes, but\nneither does he explicitly say that finite modes follow\nentirely from other finite modes. \nIf Curley is correct, then because finite modes are only\npartially determined by infinite modes, the modal transfer\nprinciple will not apply to finite modes. (One assumption here is that condition (i) requires following from entirely.) This blocks necessitarianism,\nsince no finite mode would follow entirely from something that exists necessarily. Thus, Curley’s interpretation concludes, particular\nfinite modes do not exist necessarily, despite (partly) following from God’s nature. Hence full-blown necessitarianism with respect to\nfinite modes is false and AP1, AP2, and AP3 represent genuine alternative\npossibilities for Spinoza. This finds support in passages like IIax1:   Although the first half of that statement is thoroughly traditional, Spinoza’s claim that the order of Nature leaves the existence or non-existence of particular finite things undetermined seems to posit  genuine contingency in the world. (In IIp10d, Spinoza cites IIax1 and claims that it would be “absurd” to conclude that a particular person exists necessarily, though it is unclear whether the absurdity lies in the modal conclusion itself or in the reasoning about finite essences that would lead to the modal conclusion.) As for those passages in which Spinoza\nseems to profess full-blown necessitarianism (i.e., Ip16, 17, 29, 33,\nIAppendix), his appeals to necessity could be ambiguous between a strong form of determinism and full-blown necessitarianism. Yes, everything finite necessarily follows from something else, ad infinitum, and so is “necessary” in the sense of “being fully determined,” but nothing finite follows entirely from something that necessarily exists, and so no finite mode exists necessarily in the full-blown sense of that term.[11]\nImportantly, Curley defends Spinoza’s rejection of necessitarianism without positing\na complete causal gap between finite modes and God’s nature; finite modes do partly follow from God and God’s infinite modes. \nHowever, consider AP1 again, the possibility of an entirely\ndifferent collection of finite modes. According to Curley, because no member of the collection exists necessarily, the collection\nitself is not necessary. That is, God could have brought about\nan entirely different series of finite modes. If so, what explains why\nthis series of finite modes exists as opposed to one of the\nalternative possible series? (The question is not why God chose to\ncreate this series of modes rather than another possible series, a\nquestion that animated Leibniz. Spinoza denies that God has a will in\nthe traditional sense, and so talk about choosing one possible\nworld over another has no place in Spinoza’s system (Ip17s and IIp49c).\nNonetheless, the PSR demands a reason in virtue of which God realizes\nthis series of finite modes rather than another possible series.) \nEarlier, I suggested one possible answer: perhaps the PSR itself\nfavors maximal series over less-than-maximal\nseries. However, as Leibniz worried mightily, if the PSR itself favors\none series of things over all others, in what sense are the\nalternatives genuinely possible? Alternatively, if the PSR does not\nfavor one possible series over any other – suppose more than one\nmaximal series of Spinoza’s finite modes is possible – then\nwhat explains why this series rather than the others actually exists? \nI noted that Spinoza could explain why a particular finite mode exists by appealing\n(in part) to other particular finite modes, namely its actual causes. But Spinoza could not explain why this series, as opposed to some other series, exists by appealing to\nother particular existing modes. This would be akin to explaining why\nan entire series of causes exists by appealing to one of those very\ncauses. We aren’t asking why any particular mode exists, but why this\nwhole series, and not some other series, exists. Appealing to yet\nanother contingent fact appears to get us nowhere towards accounting for the\n entire set of contingent \n facts.[12] \nNor could Spinoza appeal to substance or infinite modes to\nexplain the entire series of finite modes, for two reasons. First, according to Curley’s own account, substance and its\ninfinite modes do not fully explain or cause any particular finite mode\n(by Ip28). But as there seems to be\nnothing to the collection of finite modes above and beyond the\nindividual members themselves, it is unclear how substance and its infinite modes could  fully explain or cause the entire series without\nfully causing or explaining any individual member. \nSecond, if the entire series of finite modes were caused by\nGod or something that necessarily followed from God, then the entire series\nwould exist necessarily after all (pace AP1). Remember that\ncausation, necessary connection, and following-from track each other,\naccording to Spinoza. So if the entire series of finite modes followed from something\nthat exists necessarily, then by the modal transfer principle,\nthe series itself would also exist necessarily. If so, then there would not \nreally be any alternative possible series to the series of actual finite\nmodes. Furthermore, it is hard to see how Spinoza could block the\ntransfer of necessity from the series of finite modes to\nthe individual members of that series, in which case both AP2 and AP3 would be ruled\nout as well. \nThis leaves us with an interpretive dilemma. On the one hand,\nCurley’s account respects both the demonstration of Ip28 and Spinoza’s frequent\nclaims that all modes follow from God’s nature. A consequence of his\naccount is that Spinoza is not a full-blown necessitarian. On the other\nhand, Curley’s Spinoza must reject very natural-sounding demands\nof the PSR. Spinoza would have to accept that there is no explanation\nwhy this entire series of finite modes exists rather than another\npossible series, a point Curley concedes (Curley and Walski, 1999). \nThat concession might seem like too high an interpretive price to pay,\nespecially since there is no independent reason to think\nSpinoza rejects the demands of the PSR when applied to the entire series\nof finite modes. It would be nice if Spinoza could accept an unrestricted version of the PSR and still preserve the claim in Ip28d that\nparticular finite modes do not follow from infinite modes or the\nabsolute nature of God without recreating the problematic gap. In the\nnext section, we’ll consider an attempt to do just that. A\nconsequence of this alternative reading will be that Spinoza endorses\nfull-blown necessitarianism. \n\nLet us return to Spinoza’s crucial claim about finite modes in\nIp28. He states that particular finite modes (a) do not follow from\n“the absolute nature of an attribute of God,” even though (b)\nthey follow from an attribute of God “insofar as it is\nconsidered to be affected by some mode.” (As a reminder: I will\ncontinue to drop the reference to attributes for ease of expression.)\nTwo questions immediately arise:  \nAccording to one prominent interpretation (Garrett 1991), to follow\nfrom the absolute nature of God is to follow in an\nunqualified, pervasive and permanent manner, as infinite modes do\n(Ip21–23). Spinoza denies that finite modes follow in that way.\nHowever, following from God’s nature in a more qualified way does\nnot imply that finite modes do not follow from God at all – to infer that\nwould be to reintroduce the problem of the gap. Rather, Garrett\ncontends, in Ip28 Spinoza denies only that any particular finite mode\nfollows from God’s absolute nature independently of its\nrelations to other finite objects. This leaves open the\npossibility that although no particular finite mode follows from the\nabsolute nature of God, the entire collection of finite modes as a\nwhole follows from the absolute nature of God or from an infinite mode\nof God. \nGarrett’s account presents a five-fold division of Spinoza’s\nexpression “following from God’s nature”: \nIf we apply Spinoza’s modal transfer principle to this division, the\nobjects described in [i] and [ii] exist necessarily. Similarly, the necessity of God’s nature in [iii] trickles down the\nfollowing-from relation, and so even though the series as a whole\nfollows only indirectly from God, its existence would nonetheless be necessary, as with mediate infinite modes. That is, the modal transfer principle ignores the more\nfine-grained distinction between direct and indirect following-from\n([i] vs. [ii]-[iii]). \nWhat about particular finite modes described in [iv]? On Garrett’s\nproposal, their existence too will be necessary, which commits Spinoza to full-blown necessitarianism. To see why, notice that the\ndifference between [iii] and [iv] is not a function of the presence or\nabsence of the following-from relation itself. The difference is\nbetween following from God’s absolute vs. non-absolute nature, whatever\nthat distinction amounts to. Once again, Spinoza’s modal transfer principle is indifferent to the difference between [iii] and [iv]. The principle is too coarse-grained to track the\nabsolute/non-absolute distinction; it just tracks the\nfollowing-from relation from a necessarily existing source. Since\nboth conditions of the principle are satisfied in [iv], necessity is transferred\nfrom the entire collection of finite modes to the individual members themselves. Thus,\nthe desk exists necessarily. If this is correct, Spinoza can consistently\nclaim that every finite mode exists necessarily and follows\nfrom God’s nature in some way, while still\nmaintaining that no particular modes follows directly or indirectly\nfrom the absolute nature of God. \nThe objects described in [v] do not follow from God’s\nnature at all, in which case the modal transfer principle will not be satisfied. Insofar as that is the only available source for their necessity, it follows that they do not exist necessarily. But what is\nthe difference between the objects described in [iv] and the objects\ndescribed in [v]? In one sense, nothing: they are the same finite\nmodes! That cannot be the full story, however, lest there be no\nexplanation why the modes in [iv] follow from the nature of God whereas\nthose very same modes in [v] do not. The only difference\nbetween [iv] and [v] is how a mode is considered\n in each case. (Although Garrett himself uses this “considered” claim, he does not say whether he thinks there are any true ways of considering objects corresponding to [v].) \nHence, if the desk is considered in relation to the entire series of\nfinite modes, it follows from God’s nature and exists necessarily. Considered independently of\nthat relation — if such can be done — the desk does not follow\nfrom God’s nature and does not exist necessarily. This gives rise to a more precise version of our earlier question:  And, since that difference\nalso generates a modal difference, we should also ask: \nAnswering these questions in the next section will drive us yet deeper into\nSpinoza’s modal metaphysics. First, however,\nGarrett’s account faces an independent worry (Curley and Walski\n1999, Huenemann 1999). Return to the relationship between [iii] and\n[iv]. There is supposed to be a significant difference between the\nmanner in which the collection of finite modes follows from God as\na whole and the manner by which any particular member of that\ncollection follows from God. However, if the entire collection of\nfinite modes follows indirectly from God’s absolute nature, won’t that\nentail that each individual member of the series also follows from\nGod’s absolute nature? Imagine trying to cover the collection of objects on my desk in coffee without making it the\ncase that each object on my desk is covered in coffee. This seems impossible, as there is\nnothing more to the collection of things on my desk being covered in\ncoffee than each and every thing on my desk being covered in coffee.\nEven worse, it is hard to see how the entire series of finite\nmodes could have the property following from God’s absolute\nnature if no member of the series has that property. \nThe most promising line of response denies that the series of finite\nmodes is nothing above and beyond its individual members.\nFollowing others, I have been describing the entirety of finite modes\nas a “series” or “collection,” a label that\nnaturally suggests that the properties of the entire collection will be\nposterior to and derivative from the properties of its individual\nmembers. Spinoza himself rarely refers to just the collection\nof finite modes with a single expression, though he sometimes includes\nthem in his locution “the order of nature” and he describes them as a “series” twice, both outside the Ethics (C I/41 and C I/307). Regardless of the terminology,\none might argue in a holist vein that the whole series is more than\njust the sum of its the members. Spinoza does sometimes suggest that\nwholes can be prior to their parts (Ep32, IIp13le7s), though other\ntimes he suggests that parts are always prior to wholes (Ip15). Whether\nthe series of finite modes is more holist or atomistic, and\nwhether, on a holist mereological account, one of the non-supervening properties\nof the whole series is following from God’s absolute nature, are\nstill open interpretive questions. The soundness of this reply will\nlikely turn on whether or not the collection of finite modes is itself\nan infinite mode, a point about which interpreters continue to\ndisagree. \n\nWe have now seen two competing accounts of Spinoza’s views about the\nmodal status of finite objects. Some argue that Spinoza endorses a strong form of determinism (since\nthe infinite modes or laws of nature are themselves necessary) that falls short of full-blown necessitarianism. On this reading, finite modes do not exist necessarily and there are alternative possibilities to the series of actual finite modes that God did not bring about.  Others have argued that\nSpinoza’s account of the relationship between God and finite modes\nreadily accommodates full-blown necessitarianism and that, given the large number of passages in which Spinoza appears to affirm\nnecessitarianism without qualification, there is strong evidence\nthat Spinoza intentionally endorsed full-blown necessitarianism. \nLike almost all discussions of Spinoza’s modal commitments,\nthis dispute focus on the distribution of modal\nproperties: which things exist necessarily? Far less attention has been\ngiven to Spinoza’s account of the nature of modality. In\nthis section, I will discuss whether Spinoza has an account of\nmodality itself, and if so, what light that account sheds on the dispute over his alleged necessitarianism. \nSpinoza is emphatic that modal ascriptions have reasons behind them:\n“A thing is called necessary either by reason of its essence or\nby reason of its cause” (Ip33s1). But we can raise a higher-order\nquestion: for what reason(s) do modal ascriptions work in the way that\nSpinoza claims they do? For ease, let us focus on modal\nproperties instead of modal ascriptions. The question is\nsimilar to the one raised earlier about causation. What explains\ncausation itself? Arguably, Spinoza’s answer is that causal\nrelations obtain in virtue of conceptual connections between causal\nrelata. A parallel question can be raised about modality itself. Do\nbasic modal properties obtain in virtue of other, non-modal properties or is\nmodality primitive for Spinoza? \nGiven Spinoza’s embrace of the PSR and his efforts to explain other\ndependence relations (such as causation and, perhaps, inherence), it\nwould be surprising and disappointing if modality got a free\nexplanatory pass. Of course, we probably should not expect Spinoza to\nhave anything like a full-blown theory of modality in the forms that\ncontemporary metaphysicians now provide (for an example, see the entry\non\n actualism).\nOnly in recent decades have philosophers come to\nappreciate how complex and rich the metaphysics of modality is, and\nSpinoza would be in good company if he says things that seem, by\ntoday’s standards, mostly underdeveloped. Nonetheless, he may have the\nbeginnings of an account that helps illuminate his other modal\ncommitments. \nA promising place to start is the modal status of God’s existence.\nIn Ip11, Spinoza claims that God necessarily exists. But what is it in\nvirtue of which God necessarily exists? This might sound like an odd\nquestion. Once explanations reach a necessarily existing object, are\nthere further in virtue of questions to be asked about that\nobject’s existence? More generally, when we reach necessity, haven’t we\n reached the end of \n explanations?[14]\nNot always: mathematics is full of\nasymmetrical dependence relations among necessarily true propositions.\nSimilarly, Spinoza thinks that substance causes and asymmetrically\nexplains necessarily existing infinite modes. Hence Spinoza must\nbelieve that dependence and explanation are more fine-grained relations\nthan modern logical entailment, since according to the\nlatter, every necessary proposition entails and is entailed by every\nother necessary proposition. \nSpinoza explains the necessity of God’s existence by appealing\nto God’s nature. This may sound like a non-answer, but it is not.\nSpinoza is not claiming that there are no explanatory grounds for God’s\nexistence; he is claiming that facts about God’s nature explain\nthe modality of God’s existence. What about God’s nature\nexplains God’s existence? In Ip7 and Ip11, Spinoza appeals to an\ninvolvement relation between the concept of God’s essence and the\nconcept of God’s existence. That is, God exists in virtue of the fact\nthat the concept of God involves the concept of existence. Spinoza also\nthinks that the conceptual involvement relation between God and\nexistence explains the fact that God necessarily exists. In\nIp19d, Spinoza writes, \nIn Ip7, Spinoza equates “pertaining to its nature to\nexist” with “essence necessarily involving existence”\nand “causing itself.” Self-causation in turn is explained\nin Id1 as a “nature that cannot be conceived except as\nexisting.” That is, what explains the necessity of God’s\nexistence is the fact that the very concept of God involves the concept\nof existence. He repeats these connections in Ip24d, “For that\nwhose nature involves existence (considered in itself) is its own\ncause, and exists only from the necessity of its nature.” In\nother words, Spinoza explains necessity in terms of conceptual\nconnections. Although Spinoza does not develop a richer account of\nconceptual relations that Leibniz will later achieve, his general idea\nseems to be that conceptual relations are the relations that explain\nand ground necessary connections. \nSpinoza makes similar appeals to conceptual relations when he\ninvokes geometrical examples to describe the necessity with which other\nthings follow from God: \nSpinoza later identifies this same geometrical relationship with the\nconceptual involvement relation (IIp49). What it is for things to\nfollow from God necessarily is for those things to be (asymmetrically)\nconceived through God, whose concept involves (the concept of)\nexistence. The necessity of God and the necessity of existing things\nare both explained by and grounded in conceptual relations. Spinoza\nmakes this connection emphatic in Ip35, “Whatever we conceive to\nbe in God’s power, necessarily exists.” \nConversely, contingency obtains in virtue of the lack of certain conceptual\nconnections. In the case of contingent existence, an object exists\ncontingently just in case its concept is neither connected to the\nconcept of existence nor to something else whose concept is connected\nto (the concept of) existence. Hence if a mode is conceived in such a\nway that it is not conceived in relation to something involving\nexistence, it will exist contingently and not necessarily (as per\nIax7). The point isn’t just that it would be conceived as\ncontingent. On this account, how a thing is conceived partly fixes its modal status. In explaining modal features in terms of an\ninvolvement relation between concepts, Spinoza provides an answer to (3) from the previous section and thereby identifies\nhimself with a long and distinguished tradition of philosophers who\nexplain modal facts by appeal to conceptual relations. \nThis account also explains why Spinoza is attracted to his modal\ntransfer principle in the first place. Recall that the modal transfer\nprinciple states that necessity transfers along following-from\nchains whose nodes include at least one necessarily existing thing. We saw earlier that Spinoza’s following-from relation is a causal relation and that causal relations are conceptual relations for Spinoza. But we just saw that necessity is also partly a function of conceptual relations.\nThus necessity transfers along following-from chains because both necessity and following-from are\ngrounded in the same relations of conceptual involvement. The underlying conceptual nature of modality, causation, and following-from explains why Spinoza’s modal transfer principle works. \nAnother upshot of all this is that modality is not a wholly extensional\naffair for Spinoza. The ways in which objects are conceived partly\ndetermines a thing’s modal status. In particular, whether a\nfinite mode exists necessarily or not depends in part on whether it\nis conceived through something whose concept involves existence. (For\nfurther discussion, see Newlands 2010b and Newlands 2017.) \n\nWith this analysis in hand, let us return to Garrett’s proposed\naccount of Spinoza’s necessitarianism. Garrett claims in [iv] that each particular mode, conceived in relation to all the other\nparticular modes, follows from God’s nature, and he concludes that therefore every finite mode exists necessarily. However, according to [v], the same finite mode conceived\nindependently of the relation to every other finite modes fails to\nfollow from God and so fails to exist necessarily. Spinoza’s conceptual account of modality explains why he thought modality works in this particular way. \nSuppose the entire collection of finite modes, considered as a\nwhole, follows from a necessarily existing infinite mode. Hence, the\nentire collection as a whole exists necessarily. In order for a\nparticular finite mode in that collection to exist necessarily, it\nmust be conceived as following from something\nthat exists necessarily. How can a finite mode be\nconceived as following from something that exists necessarily? The answer is clear: by being conceived in\nrelation to the whole collection. That is, when finite modes are\nconsidered in relation to all the other finite modes, the\nright conceptual connection obtains and Spinoza’s modal transfer\nprinciple is satisfied. This provides an answer to (2′) from the previous section. Whether a mode is considered in relation to the rest of the\nseries is relevant to its modal status because (a) modal facts are sensitive to the conceptual relations that the considering relation picks up on and (b) considering a particular finite mode in relation to the whole series of finite modes tracks the relevant conceptual connection that satisfies the modal transfer principle. \nOf course, not just any way of considering a finite mode will be\nrelevant for its modal status. Considered as “the largest piece\nof furniture in the office,” the desk does not exist necessarily. By Spinoza’s lights, the way of conceiving the desk needs to involve something\nthat follows from God’s nature if the desk is to exist necessarily.\nThis is why, if Garrett is correct, considering the desk in relation to the rest of the entire\nseries of finite objects is relevant for its modal\nstatus, whereas considering the desk in other, less causally relevant or\nmore isolated ways, is not.[15] \n\nIf particular finite things exist necessarily in virtue of being\nconsidered in relation to the whole series of finite things, two\nlingering questions remain:  That is, if modality is\nsensitive to ways of conceiving objects, does Spinoza think there are\nmultiple ways of conceiving finite modes, such that objects can have\ndifferent modal profiles depending on how they are conceived? \nWith the respect to (4), Spinoza’s answer is\nunfortunately negative. Spinoza sometimes describes the mental\ncorollary of these very inclusive and complete ways of conceiving objects in terms of\nadequacy, and he is very pessimistic about our ability to have\nadequate ideas of particular things (see especially IIp24–31, though he\nholds out more hope in Part Five). Spinoza even links our natural\ntendencies to represent objects independent of their infinitely extensive\ncausal networks with their contingency (IIp31c), just as the above\ninterpretation predicts. So while we can understand the metaphysical\nprinciples which guarantee the necessary existence of a finite thing insofar as it is conceived in relation to every other finite thing, we tend to adopt far more limited concepts of finite things, in virtue of which necessitarianism is false. Spinoza remains confident that there is a complete way of conceiving a particular finite object in relation to all others, but it is unlikely that we will ever\nbe able to psychologically grasp such complete and\nnecessitating concepts. Spinoza’s metaphysics here meets his psychology, and psychology wins.  \nThis is an unfortunately negative answer in the light of\nSpinoza’s ethical theory. As a systematic thinker, Spinoza thinks\nmetaphysical conclusions about modality have consequences for ethics.\nAlthough pursuing the relations between Spinoza’s metaphysics and\nethics are beyond the scope of this entry, Spinoza clearly thinks\nthat ethically relevant conclusions follow from his metaphysics of modality. For example, he writes in Vp6:   Spinoza thinks we morally improve by gaining power over our passive affects and\nbecoming more active (Vp4), so our inability to conceive finite things as related to everything else (and so as existing necessarily) means our prospects for moral perfection are quite dim. \nWith respect to (5), Spinoza suggests that there are\nmore and less complete ways of genuinely conceiving objects (see, for\ninstance, Ip24d and IVd3–4). Indeed, on the functional account of\nSpinoza’s ontology mentioned in section 2 above, finite modes just are incomplete ways of expressing or conceiving God. So unless\nSpinoza thinks there are no finite modes, he had better not think that expressive or conceptual incompleteness by itself entails falsity.\n [16] \nIf there are true but incomplete ways of conceiving objects, Spinoza\nwill occupy the interesting position of consistently affirming both\nnecessitarianism and its denial, relative to these different ways of\nconceiving objects. This pairing sounds like a contradiction until we\nappreciate the force of Spinoza’s conceptualist account of modality. If\nthe truth-value of modal predications is sensitive to ways of\nconceiving objects (as a modern day anti-essentialist might agree),\nand if Spinoza endorses a variety of modally salient ways of\nconceiving objects, then he can consistently affirm both the truth and\nfalsity of full-blown necessitarianism relative to different ways of\nconceiving finite objects. \nIf this is all correct (a very big “if”!), then Garrett\nand Curley’s modal conclusions are both right, though neither\ntells the complete modal story. Something less than full-blown\nnecessitarianism will be true in virtue of ways of conceiving objects\nthat do not include their relations to the entire, infinitely large and\ncomplex range of other particular things. At the same time, full-blown necessitarianism will  also be true in virtue of ways of conceiving finite things\nthat are maximally inclusive with respect to relations to the rest of\nthe world. This middle ground provides an answer to Curley’s otherwise\nworrisome objection to the necessitarian interpretation: “If each\nparticular feature of the universe, considered in itself, is\ncontingent, then their totality is also contingent” (Curley 1988,\n 49).[17]\nThis expansion of\ncontingency from the part to the whole would be true only if the shift\nin the ways finite things are conceived did not sometimes entail a shift in their modal status. Although this is a very widespread essentialist assumption\ntoday, it is a false one according to this reading of\nSpinoza’s modal theory. Just as necessitarianism at the most expansive\nconceptual level does not jeopardize contingency at narrower levels,\nso too contingency at narrower levels need not bleed into\nthe modal status of things conceived in the most expansive way. \n\nA final and underexplored topic in Spinoza’s modal metaphysics\nconcerns what we might call the ground of modality. There was\na lively dispute in the 17th century about the relationship\nbetween God and modality. Although there was a general consensus that\nmodal facts – like so much else – depend on God in some\nway or other, there was considerable disagreement over exactly how to\nunderstand that dependence. Monotheistic metaphysicians disagreed over\nboth (a) on what in God modal truths and modal truth-makers depend and\n(b) by what manner of dependence modal truths and modal-truth makers\ndepend on God. The first set of issues concerns the divine\nground of modality and the second concerns the grounding\nrelation that modality bears to its ground (for some recent\ndiscussions, see Chignell 2012 and Newlands 2013). \nSpinoza cannot accept two of the most prominent accounts proposed by\nhis contemporaries. According to Descartes, (a) modal truths and modal truth-makers depend on God’s\nvolitions and (b) the form of dependence is efficient causation. \nAccording to Leibniz, (a) modal truths and modal truth-makers depend\non God’s ideas and intellectual activities and (b) the form of\ndependence is ontological and does not involve efficient causation.\nHowever, Spinoza denies that God’s nature contains a will and\nintellect in the sense required for these accounts (Ip17s). \nNonetheless, Spinoza does think that all things depend on God\n(Ip15), and he points to an alternative account of how possibilities and\npossibilia might depend on God. He claims that non-existing modes are grounded in God’s actual attributes. “The ideas of\nsingular things, or of modes, that do not exist must be comprehended\nGod’s infinite idea in the same way as the formal essences of\nsingular things, or modes, are contained in God’s\nattributes” (IIp8). He unpacks the “comprehension” or containment\nof non-divine formal essences in conceptual terms: “Essences [of\nnon-existing things] are comprehended in another in such a way that\nthey can be conceived through it” (Ip8s2). This suggests that the\nessences of all things, including non-existing things, are conceptually\ncontained in God’s attributes. \nIn more general terms, Spinoza’s idea is that possibilities\nare grounded in God by being actually exemplified by God, a view that\nfits nicely with interpretations of Spinoza’s modes as things\nthat inhere in God (see section 1.3 above). Thus, it is possible for\nsomething to be thinking because God is actually a thinking thing\n(IIp1d). The grounding of possibility in actuality is a very attractive\nmetaphysical thesis in its own right, and Spinoza’s God has a\nsufficiently rich nature to ground all possibilities by actually\nexemplifying them all (Ip15 and Ip16). \nSpinoza’s account of the grounds of modality also presents an\ninteresting challenge to anyone attracted to the thesis that God grounds\npossibilities, but who wants to deny that God directly\nexemplifies every possibility (Newlands 2016). Those unhappy with Spinoza’s\nexpansive divine nature would need to explain how it is that God\ngrounds some possibilities, such as being extended, without actually\nbeing extended. One could follow Descartes in harkening back to the\nScholastic notion of “eminent” containment, but Spinoza\nreads that appeal as the name of the problem, not its solution. Leibniz\nwas sometimes attracted to the idea that every basic creaturely\npossibility is formed from God’s non-mental perfections, but he\nhas a very hard time explaining how every creaturely possibility can be\nconstructed out of the sparse set of traditional divine\nperfections. \nWithout reducing creaturely possibilities to God’s actual perfections (as idealists do with extension), Spinoza\npresents an alternative grounding thesis and a challenge. Let every\npossibility be grounded in God via actual exemplification, even if this\nrequires expanding the divine nature beyond its traditional boundaries.\nFor those unwilling to follow Spinoza on this expansion,\nSpinoza’s challenge is for proponents of nearby\nalternatives to provide a non-metaphorical explanation of how God\ngrounds certain basic possibilities without actually and directly exemplifying them.\nUntil such an account is given, Spinoza’s biting conclusion\noffers an unmet challenge: “But by what divine power could\n[extension or any property not exemplified by God] be created? They are\ncompletely ignorant of that. And this shows that they do not understand\nwhat they themselves say” (Ip15s). At the very least,\nSpinoza’s challenge highlights how his modal metaphysics extends\nbeyond the topic of necessitarianism and continues to invite wider\ninvestigation.","contact.mail":"snewlands@nd.edu","contact.domain":"nd.edu"}]
