The\npersonal, social, and political are often intertwined in Chinese\napproaches to the subject. Anyone who wants to draw from the range of\nimportant traditions of thought on this subject needs to look\nseriously at the Chinese tradition. The canonical texts of that\ntradition have been memorized by schoolchildren in Asian societies for\nhundreds of years, and at the same time have served as objects of\nsophisticated and rigorous analysis by scholars and theoreticians\nrooted in widely variant traditions and approaches. This article will\nintroduce ethical issues raised by some of the most influential texts\nin Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, Legalism, and Chinese Buddhism.\n\nIn the Analects 13.18, the Governor of She tells Confucius of\na Straight Body who reported his father to the authorities for\nstealing a sheep. Confucius (Kongzi, best known in the West under his\nlatinized name, lived in the 6th and 5th century\nB.C.E) replies that in his village, uprightness lies in fathers and\nsons covering up for each other. In the Euthyphro, Socrates\nencounters Euthyphro (whose name can be translated as “Straight\nthinker”), reputed for his religious knowledge and on his way to\nbring charges against his father for murder. The conversation between\nSocrates and Euthyphro leads to a theoretical inquiry in which various\nproposed answers as to piety’s ousia (essence) are\nprobed and ultimately found unsatisfactory, but in which no answer to\nthe piety or impiety of Euthyphro’s action is given. The\ncontrast between these two stories highlights one of the distinctive\nfeatures of Chinese ethics in general: its respect for the practical\nproblem. The practical problem discussed by Confucius and Socrates is\narguably a universal one: the conflict between loyalty owed to a\nfamily member and duty to uphold public justice within the larger\ncommunity. Confucius’s response is one dimension of a\ncharacteristically Chinese respect for the practical problem. The\nnature of the problem demands a practical response. However, another\ndimension of a reflective respect for the practical problem\nis to maintain a certain humility in the face of a really hard\nproblem. It is to be skeptical that highly abstract theories will\nprovide a response that is true to the complexities of that problem. A\ntradition exemplifying such respect will contain influential works\nthat will not pretend to have resolved recurring tensions within the\nmoral life such as those identified in the Analects and the\nEuthyphro. \nConfucius gives an immediate practical answer in 13.18, but the reader\nand commentators have been left to weave together the various remarks\nabout filiality (or as it is often called, “filial piety”)\nso as to present a rationale for that answer. These remarks quite\noften concern rather particular matters, as is the matter of turning\nin one’s father for stealing a sheep, and the implications for\nmore general issues are ambiguous. Do fathers and sons cover up for\neach other on all occasions, no matter how serious, and if there is a\ncover-up, is there also an attempt to compensate the victim of the\nwrongdoing? The particularity of these passages is tied up with the\nemphasis on praxis. What is sought and what is discussed is often the\nanswer to a particular practical problem, and the resulting\nparticularity of the remarks invites multiple interpretations. The\nsayings often are presented as emerging from conversations between\nConfucius and his students or various personages with official\npositions, or among Confucius’s students. One passage (11.22)\nportrays Confucius as having tailored his advice according to the\ncharacter of the particular student: he urges one student to ask\nfather and elder brother for advice before practicing something he has\nlearnt, while he urges the other to immediately practice; the reason\nis that the first has so much energy that he needs to be kept back,\nwhile the second is retiring and needs to be urged forward. With this\npassage in mind, we might then wonder whether the apparent tension\nbetween remarks made in connection with a concept is to be understood\nin terms of the differences between the individuals addressed or the\ncontext of the conversation. \nAll texts that have become canonical within a tradition, of course,\nare subject to multiple interpretations, but Chinese texts invite\nthem. They invite them by articulating themes that stay relatively\nclose to the pre-theoretical experience that gives rise to the\npractical problems of moral life (see Kupperman, 1999 on the role of\nexperience in Chinese philosophy). The pre-theoretical is not\nexperience that is a pure given or unconceptualized, nor is it\nnecessarily experience that is universal in its significance and\nintelligibility across different traditions of thought and culture.\nThis attention to pre-theoretical experience also leads to differences\nin format and discursive form: dialogues and stories are more suited\nfor appealing to and evoking the kind of pre-theoretical experience\nthat inspires parts of the text. By contrast, much Western philosophy\nhas gone with Plato in taking the route of increasing abstraction from\npre-theoretical experience. \nThe contrast is not meant to imply that Chinese philosophy fails to\ngive rise to theoretical reflection. Theoretical reflection of great\nsignificance arises in the Mozi, Mencius,\nHanfeizi, Xunzi, and Zhuangzi, but there is\nmore frequent interplay between the theorizing and references to\npre-theoretical experience. In Chinese texts there are suggestions for\ntheorizing about this experience, but the suggestions often indicate\nseveral different and fruitful directions for theorizing to go\nfurther. These directions may seem incompatible, and they may or may\nnot be so in the end, but the tensions between these directions are\nreal. The result is a fruitful ambiguity that poses a\nproblematic. Pre-theoretical experience poses a practical\nproblem. Apparently incompatible solutions to problems are partially\ntheorized in the text, but the apparent incompatibility is not\nremoved. Much of the value of these texts lies in their leaving the\ntensions in place with enough theory given to stimulate thinking\nwithin a certain broadly defined approach. There is more than enough\nfor the sophisticated theorist to try to interpret or to reconstruct a\nmore defined position as an extension of that broadly defined\napproach. At the same time, the problematic is partly framed with the\nlanguage of pre-theoretical experience in the form of dialogue and\nstory, making the texts accessible to a much broader range of readers\nthan is usually the case with philosophy texts. The following sections\npresent some of the major kinds of problematic that appear in the\nmajor schools of Chinese ethical thought. \nA common way to understand Confucian ethics is that it is a virtue\nethic. For some scholars this will be an obvious, uncontroversial\ntruth. For others, it is a misconstrual that imposes contentious\nWestern assumptions on Confucianism about what it is to be a person\nand what an ethics should be about. In light of this controversy, it\nis important to specify the sense in which it is relatively\nuncontroversial to claim that virtues constitute a major focus of\nattention in these texts. Virtues in the relevant sense are qualities\nor traits that persons could have and that are appropriate objects of\naspiration to realize. These virtues go into the conception of an\nideal of a kind of person that one aspires to be. Given this rather\nbroad sense of “virtue,” it is unobjectionable to say that\nConfucian texts discuss ethics primarily in terms of virtues and\ncorresponding ideals of the person. \nWhat makes the characterization of Confucianism as a virtue ethic\ncontroversial are more specific, narrower senses of\n“virtue” employed in Western philosophical theories.\nTiwald (2018) distinguishes between something like the broad sense of\nvirtue and a philosophical usage that confers on qualities or traits\nof character explanatory priority over right action and promoting good\nconsequences. Virtue ethics in this sense is a competitor to rule\ndeontological and consequentialist theories. There simply is not\nenough discussion in the Confucian texts, especially in the classical\nperiod, that is addressed to the kind of questions these Western\ntheories seek to answer. \nThere are other narrower senses of “virtue” that are\nclearly mischaracterizations when applied to Confucian ethics. Virtues\nmight be supposed to be qualities that people have or can have in\nisolation from others with whom they interact or from their\ncommunities, societies, or culture. Such atomistic virtues could make\nup ideals of the person that in turn can be specified or realized in\nsocial isolation. Further, virtues might be supposed to be\nidentifiable through generalizations that hold true in every case,\nsuch that the ways these traits are concretely manifested in conduct\ndo not vary across context or situation. Prominent and influential\ncritics of the “virtue” characterization of Confucian\nethics--Roger Ames (2011) and Robert Neville (2016)--seem to be\nsupposing that the term is loaded with such controversial\npresuppositions. \nAs will become clear in subsequent discussion here, one can employ\nvirtue language with the appropriate qualifiers and at the same time\nacknowledge much of what the critics claim as insights of Confucian\nethics: e.g., that the process of realizing the virtues\ncharacteristically takes place in relationship to others--those to\nwhom one has responsibilities as a son or daughter or mother or\nfather, for example--and that it can be part of one’s very\nidentity to be a particular person’s son or daughter, mother or\nfather. It is part of the Confucian vision of a life befitting human\nbeings that it is a life of relationships marked by mutual care and\nrespect, that one achieves fullest personhood that way. One achieves\nthis in a manner that is particular to one’s circumstances,\nincluding the particular others with whom one most interacts. None of\nthis is inconsistent with virtue characterizations in the broad sense\n(for an alternative role-ethic characterization of Confucian ethics\nthat incorporates these insights in a different way, see Ames, 2011).\n \nThe most frequently discussed ideal is that of the junzi. The\nChinese word originally meant “prince’s son,” but in\nthe Analects it refers to ethical nobility. The\nfirst English translations rendered it as “gentleman,” but\nAmes and Rosemont (1998) have usefully suggested “exemplary\nperson.” Among the traits connected to ethical nobility are\nfiliality, a respect for and dedication to the performance of\ntraditional ritual forms of conduct, and the ability to judge what the\nright thing to do is in the given situation. These traits are virtues\nin the sense that they are necessary for following the dao,\nthe way human beings ought to live their lives. As Yu (2007) points\nout, the dao plays the kind of role in ancient Chinese ethics\nthat is analogous to the role played by eudaimonia or\nflourishing, in ancient Greek ethics. The junzi is the\nethical exemplar with the virtues making it possible to follow the\ndao. \nBesides the concepts of dao and junzi, the concept\nof ren is a unifying theme in the Analects. Before\nConfucius’s time, the concept of ren referred to the\naristocracy of bloodlines, meaning something like the strong and\nhandsome appearance of an aristocrat. But in the Analects the\nconcept is of a moral excellence that anyone has the potential to\nachieve. Various translations have been given of ren. Many\ntranslations attempt to convey the idea of complete ethical virtue,\nconnoting a comprehensive state of ethical excellence. In a number of\nplaces in the Analects the ren person is treated as\nequivalent to the junzi, indicating that ren has the\nmeaning of complete or comprehensive moral excellence, lacking no\nparticular virtue but having them all. However, ren in some\nplaces in the Analects is treated as one virtue among others\nsuch as wisdom and courage. In the narrower sense of being one virtue\namong others, it is explained in 12.22 in terms of caring for others.\nIt is in light of these passages that other translators, such as D.C.\nLau, 1970a, use ‘benevolence’ to translate ren.\nHowever, others have tried to more explicitly convey the sense of\n‘ren’ in the comprehensive sense of\nall-encompassing moral virtue through use of the translation\n‘Good’ or ‘Goodness’ (see Waley, 1938, 1989;\nSlingerland, 2003). It is possible that the sense of ren as\nparticular virtue and the sense of comprehensive excellence are\nrelated in that attitudes such as care and respect for others may be a\npervasive aspect of different forms of moral excellence, e.g., such\nattitudes may be expressed in ritual performance, as discussed below,\nor in right or appropriate action according to the context. But this\nsuggestion is speculative, and because the very nature of ren\nremains so elusive, it shall be here referred to simply\nas‘ren’. \nWhy is the central virtue discussed in such an elusive fashion in the\nAnalects? The answer may lie in the role that pre-theoretical\nexperience plays in Chinese philosophy. Tan (2005) has pointed to the\nnumber and vividness of the persons in the Analects who serve\nas moral exemplars. She suggests that the text invites us to exercise\nour imaginations in envisioning what these people might have been like\nand what we ourselves might become in trying to emulate them. Use of\nthe imagination, she points out, draws our attention to the\nparticularities of virtue and engages our emotions and desires. Amy\nOlberding (2008, 2012) develops the notion of exemplarism into a\nConfucian epistemology, according to which we get much of our\nimportant knowledge by encountering the relevant objects or persons.\nUpon initial contact, we may have little general knowledge of the\nqualities that make them so compelling to us, but we are motivated to\nfurther investigate. Confucius treated as exemplars legendary figures\nfrom the early days of the Zhou dynasty, such as the Duke of Zhou and\nKings Wu and Wen. Confucius served as an exemplar to his students,\nperhaps of the virtue of ren, though he never claimed the\nvirtue for himself. Book Ten of the Analects displays what\nmight appear to be an obsessive concern with the way Confucius greeted\npersons in everyday life, e.g., if he saw they were dressed in\nmourning dress, he would take on a solemn appearance or lean forward\non the stanchion of his carriage. Such concern becomes much more\ncomprehensible if Confucius is being treated as an exemplar of virtue\nfrom which the students are trying to learn. The focus of Book Ten and\nelsewhere in the Analects also suggests that the primary\nlocus of virtue is to be found in how people treat each other in the\nfabric of everyday life and not in the dramatic moral dilemmas so much\ndiscussed in contemporary Western moral philosophy.  \nAnalects 1.15 likens the project of cultivating one’s\ncharacter to crafting something fine from raw material: cutting bone,\ncarving a piece of horn, polishing or grinding a piece of jade. The\nchapter also stresses the importance of li (the rites,\nritual) in this project. In the Analects ritual includes\nceremonies of ancestor worship, the burial of parents, and the rules\ngoverning respectful and appropriate behavior between parents and\nchildren. Later the word came to cover a broad range of customs and\npractices that spelled out courteous and respectful behavior of many\ndifferent kinds. Engaging in ritual, learning to perform it properly\nand with the right attitudes of respect while performing it, is to\nengage in a kind of cutting and carving and polishing and grinding of\nthe self. One of the most distinctive marks of Confucian ethics is the\ncentrality of ritual performance in the ethical cultivation of\ncharacter. For example, while Aristotelian habituation generally\ncorresponds to the Confucian cultivation of character, there\nis no comparable emphasis in Aristotle on the role of ritual\nperformance in this process of character transformation. Yet\nConfucians will say that any complete description of self-cultivation\nmust include a role for the culturally established customs that spell\nout what it means to express respect for another person in various\nsocial contexts. Just how that role is conceived in the\nAnalects is one of the central interpretive puzzles\nconcerning the Analects. The interpretive question of\nhow li is central to self-cultivation is posed in\nparticular about its relation to the chief virtue of ren. \nIn the Analects 3.3 the Master said, “A man who is not\nren—what has he to do with ritual?” The\nimplication is that ritual is a means of cultivating and expressing a\nren that is already there, at least in a raw or unrefined\nstate. This implication about the role of ritual is consistent with\npassages of the Analects in which Confucius shows flexibility\non the question of whether to follow established ritual practice. 9.3\nshows him accepting the contemporary practice of wearing a cheaper\nsilk ceremonial cap rather than the traditional linen cap. 9.3 also\nshows Confucius rejecting the contemporary practice of bowing after\none ascends the stairs leading up to the ruler’s dais, and\nmaintaining the traditional practice of bowing before one ascends the\nstairs. The implication is that the contemporary practice expresses\nthe wrong attitude toward the ruler—presumptuousness in assuming\npermission to ascend. 9.3 suggests that it is something like the right\nattitude that is cultivated and expressed by ritual. Kwong-loi Shun\n(1993) has called this kind of understanding of ritual the\n“instrumental” interpretation. \nHowever, in other places of the Analects, ritual seems to\ntake on a more central role in the achievement of ren.\nIndeed, it seems to be presented as the key. A very common\ntranslation of 12.1 has Confucius telling his favorite student Yan Hui\nthat “Restraining yourself and returning to the rites\nconstitutes ren. If for one day you managed to restrain\nyourself and return to the rites, in this way you could lead the\nentire world back to ren. The key to achieving ren\nlies within yourself—how could it come from others?”\n(translation from Slingerland, 2003, though see Li, 2007, for a\ndifferent translation of the word wei usually translated as\n‘constitutes’, with different implications for the\nquestion of the relation between li and ren). Such\npassages have given rise to the “definitionalist”\ninterpretation, as Shun calls it, which makes li definitive\nof the whole of ren. Obviously the instrumental and\ndefinitional interpretations cannot both be true. \nOne possibility for resolving this tension is to construe\nConfucius’ remarks as directed towards a particular student and\ninformed by his conception of what sort of advice that student needs\nto hear given his strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps Confucius believes\nthat Yan Hui should be focusing on disciplining himself through\nobserving the rites, but his advice should not be be taken as an\nintended generalization about the relationship between ren\nand li. Perhaps the remarks that suggest more of an\ninstrumentalist construal of the relationship are similarly context\nand audience bound. Such interpretation, of course, leaves open the\nquestion of what that relationship is, or indeed, whether Confucius\never had in mind a generalization about the relationship that informed\nhis remarks. \nSome have argued that such serious conflicts within the text\nconstitute reasons for thinking that the Analects is an\naccretive text, i.e., composed of layers added at different times by\ndifferent people with conflicting views. To some extent, viewing the\nAnalects as accretive is nothing new, but Bruce and A. Takeo\nBrooks (1998, 2000) have taken that view very far by identifying Book\n4 (and only part of it, for that matter) as the most reflective of the\nhistorical Kongzi’s views, and the other books as stemming from\nConfucius’s students and members of his family. The different\nbooks, and, sometimes, individual passages within the books, represent\ndifferent time periods, people, with different agendas who are\nresponding to different conditions, and often putting forward\nincompatible strands of Confucianism. The Brooks suggest that the\nparts of the Analects most directly associated with the\nhistorical Confucius and his disciples are the parts that feature\nren as the pre-eminent virtue and that de-emphasize the role\nof ritual. The parts that are due to another trend in Confucianism,\nheaded by Confucius’s descendants, are the parts that elevate\nritual as the key to ren. The Brooks’s theory of the\nAnalects has drawn appreciation and disagreement (e.g., see\nSlingerland, 2000 for both). It threatens to dislodge the assumption\nthat underlies the dominant mode of interpreting the\nAnalects, which is that the text, or most of it, reflects the\ncoherent thought of one person. \nOne response to this interpretive challenge is to acknowledge the real\npossibility that different sets of passages are the products of\ndifferent thinkers, but also to hold that these different people, even\nif they have different pragmatic and political agendas (a factor that\nthe Brooks tend to emphasize), might also have had different and\nphilosophically substantial perspectives on common problems. One of\nthose problems might indeed have been the relation between\nren and li, and at least part of the explanation of\nwhy different and potentially conflicting things are said about that\nrelation is that the relation is a difficult one to figure out and\nthat different thinkers addressing that common problem might\nreasonably have arrived at different things to say. Whether these\ndifferent things are ultimately irreconcilable remains an open\nquestion. One might take a constructive attitude to these differences,\nask what good philosophical reasons could motivate the different\napproaches, and ask whether there is a way of reconciling what all the\ngood reasons entail. \nKwong-loi Shun’s approach exemplifies such a reconciling\nstrategy. He holds that on the one hand, a particular set of ritual\nforms are the conventions that a community has evolved, and without\nsuch forms attitudes such as respect or reverence cannot be made\nintelligible or expressed (the truth behind the definitionalist\ninterpretation). In this sense, li constitutes ren\nwithin or for a given community. On the other hand, different\ncommunities may have different conventions that express respect or\nreverence, and moreover any given community may revise its conventions\nin piecemeal though not wholesale fashion (the truth behind the\ninstrumentalist interpretation). \nChenyang Li (2007) proposes a different approach based on a different\nreading of the word ‘wei’ used in 12.1 and often\ntranslated as ‘constitutes’ to render the crucial line,\n“Restraining yourself and returning to the rites constitutes\nren.” Li notes that a common meaning of the word is\n‘make’ or ‘result in.’ The relation between\nli and ren need not be construed as either\ndefinitional or constitutive, nor need it be construed as purely\ninstrumental. Li proposes that li functions something like a\ncultural grammar where ren is like mastery of the culture.\nMastery of a language entails mastery of its grammar but not vice\nversa.  \nBoth Shun and Li are striving to capture a way in which ren\ndoes not reduce to li but also a way in which li is\nmore than purely instrumental to the realization of ren.\nThere are good philosophical reasons for this move. Consider the\nreasons for resisting the reduction of ren to li. As\nindicated above, 9.3 suggests that the attitudes of respect and\nreverence that are expressed by ritual forms are not reducible to any\nparticular set of such forms, and Shun has a point in arguing that\nsuch attitudes could be expressed by different sets of such forms as\nestablished by different communities. In studying the cultures of\nother communities, we recognize that certain customs are meant to\nsignify respect, even if we do not share these customs, just as we\nrecognize that something that does not signify disrespect in our\nculture does indeed so signify in another culture. The fact that we\ncan distinguish the attitude from the ritual forms that we use to\nexpress them allows us to consider alternative ritual forms that could\nexpress the same attitude. Ceremonial caps that are made of more\neconomical material are acceptable, perhaps, because wearing such caps\nrather than the material ones need not affect the spirit of the\nceremony. By contrast, bowing after one ascends the stairs constitutes\nan unacceptable change in attitude. To maintain that particular ritual\nforms do not define the respect and reverence they are\nintended to express is not to underestimate their importance for\ncultivating and strengthening these attitudes. Acting in ways that\nexpress respect given the conventionally established meanings of\naccepted ritual forms helps to strengthen the agent’s\ndisposition to have respect. The ethical development of character does\ninvolve strengthening some emotional dispositions over others. We\nstrengthen dispositions by acting on them. By providing conventionally\nestablished, symbolic ways to express respect for others, ritual forms\ngive participants ways to act on and therefore to strengthen the right\ndispositions. The cultivating function of observing ritual highlights\nthe distinctive practical focus of Confucian ethics. It is every bit\nas concerned with how to acquire the right sort of character\nas it is with what the right sort is. \nOn the other hand, there is good reason to resist the reduction of\nli simply to the role of expressing and cultivating a set of\nattitudes and emotional dispositions. In his influential\ninterpretation (1972) of the Analects, Herbert Fingarette\nconstrues ritual performance as an end in itself, as beautiful and\ndignified, open and shared participation in ceremonies that celebrate\nhuman community. Ritual performance, internalized so that it becomes\nsecond nature, such that it is gracefully and spontaneously performed,\nis a crucial constituent of a fully realized human life. There are\nnonconventional dimensions of what it is to show respect, such as\nproviding food for one’s parents (see Analects 2.7),\nbut the particular way the agent does this will be deeply influenced\nby custom. Indeed, custom specifies what is a respectful way of\nserving food. On the Confucian view, doing so in a graceful and\nwhole-hearted fashion as spelled out by the customs of one’s\ncommunity is part of what it is to live a fully human life. \nRitual constitutes an important part of what ren is, and\nhence it is not merely an instrument for refining the substance of\nren. At the same time it is not the whole of ren.\nConsider that part of ren that involves attitudinal\ndispositions. Attitude is not reducible to ritual form even if acting\non that form can cultivate and sustain attitude. Moreover, 7.30\nemphasizes the connection between desire for ren and its\nachievement (“If I simply desire ren, I find that it is\nalready there”). The achievement of ren is of course a\ndifficult and long journey, and so 7.30 implies that coming to truly\ndesire it lies at the heart of that achievement. The multifaceted\nnature of ren emerges in Book 12, where Confucius is\nportrayed as giving different descriptions of ren. In 12.1,\nas already noted, he says that ritual makes for ren. But then\nin 12.2, he says that ren involves comporting oneself in\npublic as if one were receiving an important guest and in the\nmanagement of the common people behaving as if one were overseeing a\ngreat sacrifice (the duty to be respectful toward others). 12.2 also\nassociates ren with shu or “sympathetic\nunderstanding,” not imposing on others what you yourself do not\ndesire. Here the emphasis is not so much on ritual or not exclusively\nanyway, but on the attitudes one displays toward others, and on the\nability to understand what others want or do not want based on\nprojecting oneself into their situation. In 12.3, when asked about\nren, Confucius says that ren people are hesitant to\nspeak (suggesting that such people take extreme care not to have their\nwords exceed their actions). And then in 12.22, when asked about\nren, Confucius says that it is to care for people. Such\ndiverse characterizations are appropriate if ren is complete\nethical virtue or comprehensive excellence that includes many\ndimensions, including but not reducing to the kinds of excellence\nassociated with li. \nIf we take the relevant passages on li and ren as\nforming a whole in which a coherent view is embedded, there is a\npretty good case for regarding the observance of ritual propriety as a\nconstituent of ren as well as crucial for instrumentally\nrealizing some other dimensions of ren. But it does not\nexhaust the substance of ren. If the text is as radically\naccretive as the Brooks maintain, then the proposed construal of the\nrelation is more of a reconstruction of what the best philosophical\nposition might be on the nature of the relation. The reconstructive\npossibility should not be disturbing as long as we recognize it for\nwhat it is. Thinkers within a complex and vigorous tradition\nfrequently re-interpret, expand, develop, revise, and even reject some\nof what one has inherited from the past. The fact that the\nAnalects itself might be a product of this kind of engagement\nmight usefully be taken as encouragement for its present students to\nengage with the text in the same way. \nThe Confucian position on the importance of li in ethical\ncultivation is interesting and distinctive in its own right, and this\nis partly because Confucianism hews close to a kind of pre-theoretical\nexperience of the moral life that might otherwise get obscured by a\nmore purely theoretical approach to ethics. If we look at everyday\nexperience of the moral life, we see that much of the substance of\nethically significant attitudes such as respect is in fact given by\ncultural norms and practices, and learning a morality must involve\nlearning these norms and practices. Children learn what their behavior\nmeans to others, and what it should mean, by learning how to greet\neach other, make requests, and answer requests, all in a respectful\nmanner. Much of our everyday experience of moral socialization lies in\nthe absorption of or teaching to others of customs that are\nconventionally established to mean respect, gratitude, and other\nethically significant attitudes (see Olberding, 2016). So construed,\nConfucian ethics provides an alternative to understanding the nature\nof the moral life that is different from an understanding that is\nprimarily based on abstract principles, even abstract principles that\nrequire respect for each person. This is why there is significant\nresonance between Confucianism and communitarian philosophies such as\nthose defended by Alasdair MacIntyre (1984, 1989) and Michael Walzer\n(1983). One of the distinctive marks of communitarianism is the theme\nthat much of the substance of a morality is given not in abstract\nprinciples of the sort typically defended in modern Western philosophy\nbut in a society’s specific customs and practices. In the\nAnalects, the ambiguous relation between ren and\nli poses the problematic of how we are to understand the\nrelation between cultural norms and practices on the one hand and that\npart of morality that appears to transcend any particular set of norms\nand practices. The Analects suggests a large role for\nculture, but on the reading suggested here, not a definitional role.\nThere is much room for theoretical elaboration on the nature of that\nrole. \nFurthermore, in understanding why Confucians take a life of ritual\npractice to be partly constitutive of a fully human life, one must\nunderstand the aesthetic dimension of their notion of a fully human\nlife. Such a life is lived as a beautiful and graceful coordinated\ninteraction with others according to conventionally established forms\nthat express mutual respect. A good part of the value attached to the\nfully human life lies in the aesthetic dimensions of a\n“dance” (Ihara, 2004) one performs with others. To better\nunderstand why the moral and the aesthetic cannot be cleanly separated\nin Confucian ethics, consider that a graceful and whole-hearted\nexpression of respect can be beautiful precisely because it reflects\nthe extent that the agent has made this moral attitude part of her\nsecond nature. The beauty has a moral dimension. Both these\nthemes—the importance of contextualized moral judgment and\naesthetic value of human interaction according to custom and\ntradition—offer opportunities for practitioners of, say,\nAnglo-American moral philosophy to reflect on what their approaches to\nthe moral life might miss. \nConsider ren in its meaning as the particular virtue of\ncaring for others and li in its aspect as the valued human\ndance. These values are the basis for characterizing Confucian ethics\nas a relational ethic, meaning that it is in part distinguished by its\nplacement of relationships at the center of a well-lived life (see\nAmes, 2011). Confucian ethics are often taken to stand in contrast to\nethics that place individual autonomy and freedom to choose how to\nlive. While there is much that is true about this contrast, it must be\ncarefully described so as to differentiate it from some other\ncontrasts. For example, the value of individual autonomy usually\nincludes several different dimensions that do not necessarily\naccompany one another: (1) prioritizing of individual interests over\ngroup or collective interests when these conflict; (2) giving moral\npermission to the individual to choose from a significantly wide range\n(within certain moral boundaries) of ways to live; and (3) emphasizing\nthe importance of living according to one’s own understanding of\nwhat is right and good even if others do not see it the same way. \nConfucian ethics in significant part, though not in all parts, accepts\nautonomy in the sense of (3) (see Shun, 2004; and Brindley, 2010).\nConfucius is often depicted in the Analects as emphasizing\nthe importance of cultivating one’s own character even when\nothers do not recognize or appreciate one’s efforts (e.g., 4.14)\nand of acting independently of what is conventionally approved or\ndisapproved (e.g., 5.1). The texts associated with Mencius (Mengzi,\nbest known in the West under his Latinized name, lived in the 4th\ncentury B.C.E.) and Xunzi (4th and 3rd centuries\nB.C.E.), the most pivotal thinkers in the classical Confucian\ntradition after Confucius, both articulate the necessity to speak up\nwhen one believes the ruler one is serving is on a wrong course of\naction (e.g., Mencius 1A3 and Xunzi 29.2). On the\nother hand, none of these classical thinkers argue for the necessity\nof protecting a frank subordinate from a ruler who is made angry by\ncriticism, and it could be argued that Confucianism does not fully\nendorse autonomy in sense (3) without endorsing such protection for\nthose who wish to engage in moral criticism of the powerful. \nMost interpretations present Confucian ethics as rejecting (2). There\nis a way for human beings to live, a comprehensive human good to be\nrealized, and there can be no choosing between significantly different\nways of life that are equally acceptable from a moral perspective (an\nimportant exception to this kind of interpretation is provided by Hall\nand Ames, 1987, who interpret Confucius’s dao as a\nhuman invention, collective and individual). On the other hand,\nConfucian ethics de-emphasizes legal coercion as a method for guiding\npeople along the way and instead an puts the emphasis on moral\nexhortation and inspiration by way of example (see, most famously, 2.3\nof the Analects, which emphasizes the necessity of a\nruler’s guiding his people by instilling in them a sense of\nshame rather than by the threat of external punishment). While a\nConfucian might believe in a single correct way for human beings, she\nmight endorse a significant degree of latitude for people to learn\nfrom their own mistakes and by way of example from others (see Chan,\n1999). \nConfucian ethics does not accept (1), but not because it subordinates\nindividual interests to group or collective interests (for criticism\nof the rather common interpretation of Confucianism as prioritizing\nthe group over the individual, see Hall and Ames 1998). Rather, there\nis a different conception of the relationship between individual and\ngroup interests. The best illustration of this different conception is\na story to be found in the Mencius that concerns sage-king\nShun. When Shun wanted to marry, he knew that his father, influenced\nby his stepmother, would not allow him to marry. In this difficult\nsituation, Shun decided to marry without telling his father, even\nthough he is renowned for his filiality. Mencius in fact defends the\nfiliality of Shun’s act in 5A2. He observes that Shun knew that\nhe would not have been allowed to marry if he told his father. This\nwould have resulted in bitterness toward his parents, and that is why\nhe did not tell them. The implication of this version of Shun’s\nreason is that filiality means preserving an emotionally viable\nrelationship with one’s parents, and in the case at hand Shun\njudged that it would have been worse for the relationship to have\nasked permission to marry. The conception of the relation between\nindividual and group interests embodied in this story is not one of\nsubordination of one to the other but about the mutual dependence\nbetween the individual and the group. The individual depends on the\ngroup and must make the group’s interests part of his or her own\ninterests, but, on the other side of the equation, the group depends\non the individual and must make that individual’s interests part\nof the group’s interests. Shun’s welfare depends on his\nfamily and therefore must make his family’s interests part of\nhis own (he resolves to do what is necessary to preserve his\nrelationship to his parents), but his family’s welfare depends\non Shun, and therefore it must recognize his interests to constitute\npart of its welfare (the family must recognize that it is damaging\nitself in requiring Shun to deny himself the most part important of\nhuman relationships). \nThe way that Confucianism conceives of the relationship between the\nindividual and the group, as well as the way it is typically\nmisconceived, is reflected in its notion of harmony or\nhe. A typical misconception of harmony as a Confucian value\nis that it involves agreement and conformity with the views of others.\nIn Analects 13.23, however, Confucius says that the\njunzi pursues harmony rather than sameness, while the small\nperson does the opposite. The pre-Confucian thinker Yan Ying expresses\na similar idea about harmony in likening it to a soup made with meat\nor fish, the strong flavor of which must be balanced and complemented\nby other ingredients such as vinegar, sauce, salt, and plum\n(Zuozhuan, Duke Zhao, 20th year; see Legge 1960 translation).\nThe metaphor is meant to convey the idea that a ruler will not seek\nonly ministers who agree with him but will seek to reconcile a\ndiversity of viewpoints from his ministers. Reconciliation not only\ninvolves acceptance of difference but also tension and conflict (Li\n2014) that are brought into a productive equilibrium. Moreover, that\nequilibrium is dynamic and is continuously created and re-created. \nAlong with the emphasis on li, the centrality of filiality is\none of the most distinctive characteristics of Confucian ethics. The\nAnalects 2.6 says to give parents no cause for anxiety other\nthan illness, whereas 2.7, as mentioned earlier, emphasizes the need\nfor the material support of parents to be carried out in a respectful\nmanner. 2.8 emphasizes that it is the expression on one’s face\nthat is filial and not just taking on the burden of work or letting\nelders partake of the wine and food before others. \nIs obedience to parents always required of the filial child? What if\nthe child believes that parents are wrong and their wishes run\ncontrary to what is right or to ren? In those cases where one\nthinks them wrong, what is one to do? The Analects 2.5\nportrays Confucius as saying, “Do not disobey,” but when\nqueried further as to his meaning, he explains obedience in terms of\nconformance to the rites for burying and sacrificing to deceased\nparents. In 4.18 Confucius says that when one disagrees with\none’s parents, one should remonstrate with them gently. Most\ntranslations of what follows have Confucius concluding that if parents\nare not persuaded, one should not oppose them (e.g., Lau, 1979;\nSlingerland, 2003; Waley, 1938), but it is possible to read the spare\nand ambiguously worded passage as requiring instead that one not\nabandon one’s purpose in respectfully trying to change\none’s parents’ minds (Legge, 1971; see Huang, 2013, 133-37\nfor a survey of the different interpretations and an argument for the\npersistence-in-remonstrating translation). In other Confucian texts,\nthe question of whether obedience is required has received different\nanswers in the Confucian tradition. Chapters 1 and 2 of the Record\nof Ritual (Legge, 1967, vol. 1) say that one must obey if one\nfails to persuade one’s parent. On the other hand, Xunzi\ndeclares that following the requirements of morality rather than the\nwishes of one’s father is part of the highest standard of\nconduct (29.1 of the Xunzi; for a translation see Knoblock,\n1988–94; or Hutton 2014) and moreover that if following the\ncourse of action mandated by one’s father would bring disgrace\nto the family and not following it would bring honor, then not\nfollowing is to act morally (29.2 of the Xunzi).\nXunzi’s position is supported in part by the distinction between\nservice to parents and obedience to them. It might very well fail to\nbe of service to parents if following their wishes is to bring moral\ndisgrace to them and the family. \nAnother ethical issue arising from the strong Confucian emphasis on\nfiliality concerns possible conflicts between loyalty to parents and\nloyalty to the ruler or public justice. Consider again\nAnalects 13.18, in which Confucius says that uprightness is\nfound in sons and fathers covering up for each other. In this case, at\nleast, loyalty to parents or to children takes precedence over loyalty\nto ruler or to public justice. This precedence is one implication of\nthe Confucian doctrine of care with distinctions (“care with\ndistinctions” is the usual translation, but perhaps “care\nwith distinctions” is less misleading because it covers both the\nemotionally freighted attitude toward kin and a more distanced\nattitude toward strangers). Though all people are owed moral concern,\nsome are owed more than others, according to the agent’s\nrelationship to them. \nTo introduce other kinds of problematic treated by Confucian thinkers,\nit is necessary to identify a pivotal critic of Confucianism in the\nclassical period. Mozi (probably 5th century B.C.E), who\npossibly was once a student of Confucianism, came to reject that\nteaching, partly on the grounds that the Confucian emphasis on ritual\nand musical performance was a wasteful expenditure of resources that\ncould otherwise be used to meet the basic needs of the many\n(Mozi, chapters 25, 32; see Watson, 1967 for a translation).\nA related criticism in the text of the Mozi is that tradition\ndoes not hold normative authority simply because it is tradition, for\nthere was a time when the practice in question was not tradition but\nnew (chapter 39). If a practice has no authority when it is new, it\nhas no authority at any subsequent time simply because it is getting\nolder.  \nMozi also argued that exclusive concern for one’s own (oneself,\none’s family, one’s state) is at the root of all\ndestructive conflict (chapter 16). Exclusive concern for the self\ncauses the strong to rob the weak. Exclusive concern for one’s\nfamily causes great families to wreak havoc on lesser families (it is\nnot difficult to see how this thought might apply to the idea of\nprotecting one’s own, even if they have committed serious crimes\nagainst others outside the family). Exclusive concern toward\none’s state causes great states to attack small states. Mozi\nadvocated the doctrine of jian ai as a remedy.\n“Ai” usually means “love” or\n“affection,” but for Mozi it probably meant an emotionally\ncooler form of concern. “Jian” usually means\n“inclusive.” One possible translation of “jian\nai” is “inclusive care” (see Fraser, 2016).\nOther translations render “jian” as\n“impartial,” as in “impartial care” (see\nIvanhoe 2005). The latter translation conveys clearly the\nunderstanding that Confucians, at least since Mencius, have had of\njian ai, which is that it requires one to have equal concern\nfor everyone regardless of one’s relationship to them. The next\nsection explains how Mencius incorporated this understanding of\njian ai in his criticism of it and in his development of\nConfucian ethics.  \nThe substantial following that Mohism gained in the classical period\nforced a response from Confucians (see Hansen, 1992, and Van Norden\n2007, for a discussion of Mozi’s pivotal impact on the Chinese\ntradition). They responded on two subjects: first, they had to address\nwhat is required by way of concern for all people and how to reconcile\nsuch concern with the greater concern for some that the Confucian\ndoctrine of care with distinctions requires; second, they had to\naddress the question of what kinds of concern are motivationally\npossible for human beings, partly in response to the Mohist argument\nthat it is not difficult to act on jian ai (which they came\nto interpret as being contrary to care with distinctions), and partly\nin response to others who were skeptical about the possibility of\nacting on any kind of genuinely other-regarding concern. Mencius, in\nthe text purporting to be a record of his teachings, explicitly sets\nhimself to the task of defending Confucianism not only against Mohism\nbut the teachings of Yang Zhu. Yang’s teachings seemed to\nMencius to sit on the opposite end of the spectrum from Mohism (there\nis no surviving text purporting to articulate and defend Yangism).\nAccording to Mencius’s characterization, Yang Zhu criticized\nboth Mohism and Confucianism for asking people to sacrifice themselves\nfor others. Yang Zhu on this view was an ethical egoist: i.e., one who\nholds that it is always right to promote one’s own welfare.\nMencius positioned Confucianism as the occupying the correct mean\nbetween the extremes of having concern only for oneself on the one\nhand and having an equal degree of concern for everyone. \nMencius 1A7 purports to be an account of a conversation\nbetween Mencius and King Xuan, the ruler of a Chinese state. Mencius\nis attempting to persuade the king to adopt the Confucian dao\nor way of ruling. The king wonders whether he really can be the kind\nof king Mencius is advocating, and Mencius replies by asking whether\nthe following story he has heard about the king is true. The story is\nthat the king saw an ox being led to slaughter for a ritual sacrifice.\nThe king decided to spare the ox and substituted a lamb for the ritual\nsacrifice. Thinking back on that occasion, the king recalls that it\nwas the look in the ox’s eyes, like that of an innocent man\nbeing led to execution, that led him to substitute the lamb. Mencius\nthen comments that this story demonstrates the king’s capability\nto become a true king, and that all he has to do is to extend the sort\nof compassion he showed the ox to his own people. If he can care for\nan ox, he can care for his subjects. To say that he can care for an ox\nbut not for his people is like saying “my strength is sufficient\nto lift heavy weight, but not enough to lift a feather”\n(translation adapted from Lau, 1970a) His failure to act on behalf of\nhis people is due simply to his not acting, not to an inability to\nact. What the king has to do, suggests Mencius, is to treat the aged\nin his family as aged, and then extend it to the aged in other\nfamilies; treat his young ones as young ones, and extend it to the\nyoung ones of others; then you can turn the whole world in the palm of\nhis hand.  \nThe passage demonstrates one characteristic of the text that is\npertinent to Mencius’s response to Mohism. In contrast to the\nAnalects, the ruler’s duties to care for his people are\nmore frequently discussed and play a more prominent role in the\nconception of a ruler’s moral excellence. Mencius is portrayed\nin this text as very much engaged in getting the kings of Chinese\nstates to stop mistreating their subjects, to stop drafting their\nsubjects into their wars of territorial expansion, and to avoid\novertaxing them to finance their wars and lavish projects. At the same\ntime, Mencius’s assertion that the king is able to extend the\nkind of concern he showed the ox toward his own people is a reply to\nthose who advocate Yangism on the grounds that acting for one’s\nown sake is natural. Mencius holds that natural compassion is a part\nof human nature. The task of moral self-cultivation is the task of\n“extending” what is natural. What is natural, or at least\nmore so, is properly acting toward the aged and the young in\none’s family and then extending that to the aged and the young\nin other families. \nExtension is necessary because natural compassion is uneven compared\nto where it ought to extend. King Xuan may find it natural to have\ncompassion for an innocent man about to be executed or a terrified ox\nabout to be slaughtered, but not toward all his subjects when he is\nfocusing on the benefits that a war of territorial expansion might\nbring him. This story of Mencius, the King, and the ox is rich\nmaterial for reflection on the nature of moral development. It seems\nplausible that development must begin with something that is of the\nright nature to be shaped into the moral virtues, and also plausible\nthat what we begin with is not as it fully should be. The questions\nposed by the story is what the natural basis of morality is and how\nfurther development occurs. Mencius’s theory of the “four\nduan” addresses these questions.\n“Duan” literally means “tip of\nsomething” and is often translated as “beginnings”\nin this context.  \nWhat are the four beginnings of morality? In 2A6 human nature (ren\nxing) it is said that no person is devoid of a heart (the word\nfor heart in Chinese stands for the seat of thinking and feeling,\nhence often translated as “the mind”) sensitive to the\nsuffering of others, and to illustrate this beginning, Mencius asks us\nto suppose that a man were suddenly to see a young child about to fall\ninto a well. Such a man would certainly be moved to compassion, not\nbecause he wanted to get in the good graces of the parents, nor\nbecause he wished to win the praise of his fellow villagers or\nfriends, nor yet because he disliked the cry of the child. This\nnatural compassion can develop into the virtue of ren (in\nMencius, ren is more often a particular virtue that concerns\ncaring and hence is often translated as “benevolence”). A\nsecond beginning is the heart that feels shame in certain situations,\ne.g., in 6A10, Mencius says that if rice and soup are offered after\nbeing trampled upon, even a beggar would disdain them. Under the right\nconditions, innate shame develops into the virtue of yi or\nrighteousness—being able to do the right thing. The third\nbeginning is the heart that feels courtesy,e.g., the younger sometimes\ninstinctively knows to respect and be courteous to the older. Under\nthe right conditions, courtesy develops into li, which as a\nvirtue consists in the observance of the rites or the virtue of ritual\npropriety. And finally, there is the heart that has a sense of right\nand wrong (shi/fei, the thing to do or not to do). Under the\nright conditions, this sense of approval and disapproval develops into\nwisdom, which includes having a grasp of the spirit behind moral rules\nso that one knows how to be flexible in applying them. \nIt is important to note that Mencian beginnings of morality are not\njust blind feelings or primitive urges to act in certain ways, but\ncontain within them certain intuitive judgments about what is right\nand wrong, what is to be disdained and what is deferential, respectful\nbehavior. In the example of the beggar who does not accept food that\nhas been trampled upon, it seems that Mencius is suggesting we have an\noriginal, unlearned sense that allows us to judge the sort of respect\nthat is due to ourselves as human beings. Similarly, in suggesting\nthat we have an unlearned sense of deference, Mencius is suggesting\nthat we have an unlearned sense of what is due to others such as\nelders and our parents. Mencius’s theory tallies with some of\nthe more recent theories of emotion that point toward the intertwining\nof cognitive and affective dimensions (the theory does not necessarily\nimply, however, that the affective amounts to nothing more than the\ncognitive, as shall be discussed later). \nThe Mencius contains different metaphors that convey a view\nof human nature as the basis for moral development. On one metaphor,\nused in a debate with rival philosopher Gaozi in 6A2, the inborn\ngoodness of human nature is like the tendency of water to flow\ndownward. The metaphor implies that human beings develop virtues in\nthe absence of abnormal interference such as water being damned up or\nstruck so that it splashes upward. On the other way of conceiving\nethical development, the four beginnings are more like barley sprouts\nthat need nurture analogous to sun, water, and fertile soil (6A7).\nThat these two conceptions are significantly different can be seen\nthrough the recognition that “growing” conditions for the\nsprouts are not necessarily provided in the normal course of affairs\n(see Wong, 2015b). \nIn some passages, extension is characterized as a matter of simply\npreserving or not losing what is given to one at birth (4B12, 4B19,\n4B28, 6A10, 6A11), and such passages accord with the water metaphor in\nsuggesting that moral development happens in the absence of abnormal\ninterference. In other places, the thinking seems to be more in accord\nwith the sprout metaphor and identifies conditions for moral\ndevelopment that go well beyond noninterference: kings are held\nresponsible for providing for their subjects a constant means of\nlivelihood (1A7) that enables them to support parents and nurture wife\nand children; kings must also ensure the appropriate moral education\nabout filiality, about the duties that rulers and subjects owe to each\nother and about respect for the elder. Mencius furthermore recognized\nnatural predispositions other than the four beginnings that could\npotentially lead human beings astray. He mentions the desires of the\nsenses in this regard (6A15). This is why Mencius places\nresponsibility on everyone to si (reflect on, turn over in\none’s mind) (6A14, 6A15) the manifestations of the four\nbeginnings. With such reflection, human beings can recognize that\nvirtue takes precedence over satisfaction of potentially conflicting\ndesires and feelings (e.g., the priority of righteousness over the\ndesire for life if one cannot have both), but lack of reflection will\nstunt moral development (6A9). If the deprivation of nourishing\nconditions is severe enough, the sprouts can be killed off (6A8).\nThus, while Mencius is often characterized superficially by his saying\nthat human nature is good (6A6), he means (at least when his thinking\nis guided by the sprout metaphor) that it contains predispositions to\nfeel and act in morally appropriate ways and to make intuitive\nnormative judgments that can with the right nurturing conditions give\nhuman beings guidance as to the proper emphasis to be given to the\ndesires of the senses (see Shun, 1997; Van Norden, 2004, 2007). \nIt is not surprising that there should be the kind of ambiguity\nexpressed by the juxtaposition of the water and sprout metaphors in\nMencius. A very common contemporary conception of the innate comes\nvery close to the implications of the water metaphor, i.e., that which\ndevelops under normal conditions. On the other hand, we are also\ncapable of recognizing that other things develop under a narrower or\nmuch more contingent (not necessarily realized in the normal course of\naffairs) set of conditions. A barley sprout develops only if human\nbeings plant it in the right kind of soil and put effort into\ncultivating it. Yet it seems intuitively correct to say that its\ndirection of growth is innate. If the conditions for growth are\nrealized, it will become a barley plant, not a corn plant.\nContemporary thinking about the innate bases of morality also shows\nthis range of thinking. Claims that morality is constrained by an\ninnate universal grammar (e.g., Hauser, 2008; Mikhail, 2011) seem\ncloser to the idea that the moral (or its underlying universal\nstructure) develops under normal conditions; other conceptions\nacknowledge more of a role for contingent factors (Nichols, 2004;\nHaidt and Bjorklund 2008). The ambiguity in Mencius’ thought,\nthen, anticipates contemporary swings in thinking about the relative\nroles of what human beings are born with and what they acquire through\nlearning, experience and culture. \nMuch of what is fascinating in Mencius lies in his explorations of how\nmoral learning takes place and how this learning might also interact\nwith emotion. Consider now in combination the theme that the cognitive\nand affective go into the constitution of emotion and the theme that\nthe emotional beginnings of morality can be extended through provision\nof the right kind of nurture. What is necessary for extension? Is\ncognitive extension, i.e., more moral knowledge, sufficient? The\nanswer to this question depends on the nature of the intertwining\nbetween the cognitive and affective in emotions. Consider again the\nstory of King Xuan and the ox. Mencius expresses confidence in King\nXuan’s ability to have compassion for his people, based on his\nact of compassion for the ox. Here the question of whether cognitive\nextension is sufficient emerges in the concrete. Was it sufficient for\nMencius to have reminded the king that he has even more of a reason to\nspare his people from suffering than he had to spare the ox from\nsuffering (more reason because Mencius clearly ranks the interests of\nanimals below those of human beings, and because for him there is a\ngood moral reason for the performance of ritual sacrifices)? Logical\nconsistency alone cannot be expected to provide motivation, as David\nNivison has pointed out (1996), but then what is Mencius trying to do\nwith the King if not move him through logic?  \nNowhere in the Mencius is there enough said to point to a\ndefinitive interpretation on this matter, but various reconstructions\nof possible positions can be given. Perhaps the King’s innate\nnature contains all the motivation he needs, and all that Mencius is\ndoing is reminding him that he has the motivation to spare his people.\nThis interpretation seems roughly in accord with Mencius’\nlikening moral development to water flowing downward: it will proceed\nunless interfered with. Perhaps the King’s nature needs some\ndegree of transformation that starts with the sort of compassion he\ncan feel for a terrified ox or an innocent man about to be executed\nand then expands the scope of that compassion to more of its\nappropriate objects. This interpretation seems roughly in accord with\nMencius’ likening moral development to the growth of sprouts\nthat need the appropriate water, soil and cultivation efforts. (See\nIm, 1999, Ivanhoe, 2002, Shun, 1997, Wong, 2002, Van Norden, 2007, and\nMcRae 2011 for a range of different possible positions that could be\nattributed to Mencius). \nWhat seems philosophically fruitful about the Xuan and ox story is\nthat it portrays an attempt at moral teaching of the kind that\nactually occurs in the moral life, and the ambiguity that it presents\nto the reader is fruitful precisely because it is not a completely\ntheorized story. We are not told exactly what Mencius is trying to do\nwith the King in terms of a theory of the nature of emotions and the\nrelation between the cognitive and affective. Rather, we are led to\nreflect on the most plausible possibilities in trying to arrive at a\nreconstruction of what might have been meant by the text, as well as\nwhat might be the most illuminating position on its own merits. The\nstory is particularly intriguing for those philosophers who believe in\nthe possibility that learning can influence emotion at the same time\nthat emotion can help learning become motivationally efficacious. At\none moment in the conversation between King Xuan and Mencius, the King\nremarks that Mencius has helped him to understand that he was truly\nmotivated by compassion to spare the ox. As Mencius was talking, he\nsays, he felt the stirrings of compassion again. It is at this point\nthat Mencius reminds the King of the suffering of his people. Perhaps\nwhat Mencius was trying to do was to expand the scope of the\nKing’s feeling for those who suffer. He may know in the abstract\nthat he has a duty to advance the welfare of his people, but he may\nnot feel it very much, and by stimulating the King to re-experience\nthe feeling of compassion he had for the ox, Mencius is perhaps trying\nto get that feeling to expand to include his subjects. Mencius is\nreminding the King of his duty precisely when he has primed the King\nto assimilate it emotionally. In any case, this is a plausible picture\nof how the cognitive and affective can interact in emotionally\ndevelopment and both be necessary for effective moral motivation (see\nWong, 2015a). \nIf we recall Mencius’s saying in 6A10 that even a beggar would\nrefuse food that has been trampled upon, we may infer that something\nlike a concept of human dignity is implied. In virtue of the four\nduan, we are entitled to respect. What is of further\ninterest, however, is the idea that the source of our dignity is also\nthe source of our responsibilities to each other and to ourselves. We\nhave the responsibility of reflecting on the duan, and if we\nabuse them and kill them off, we have made ourselves unworthy of the\nrespect to which we were originally entitled. These implications of\nthe Mencian idea about the source of human dignity are not so much\nhighlighted in the Western tradition. The idea that we might render\nourselves unworthy of the basic respect to which we are originally\nentitled might appear harsh, but what should be kept in mind is that\nothers share in the responsibility to develop our duan. Most\nimportantly our family shares in that responsibility, but as Mencius\nalso emphasizes, the king has responsibility for putting in the\nconditions for material security that enable most people to reflect on\nand develop their duan. In fact Mencius holds responsible the\nking who does not provide a constant means of livelihood for the\ncrimes his people commit in order to survive and feed their families.\nIt is those who have adequate material security and moral education\nand yet who still fail to reflect who must bear the fuller share of\nresponsibility for their wrongdoing.  \nWhat about the priority of filial loyalty over loyalty to the larger\ncommunity? Mencius’ defense of this priority draws from his\ntheory of human nature as containing not only the beginnings of\naffective motivations for being moral but also intuitive judgments\nabout what is right and about what deserves the feeling of shame. His\nquestion to a Mohist, Yizi, is how Yizi can justify providing his\ndeceased parents a special burial when the Mohist prescriptions are\nfor a plain burial for anyone. Yizi’s reply is to quote from the\nBook of History: the sage-kings treated all their subjects as\nif they were their new-born children. Yizi’s interpretation of\nthis saying is that there should be no distinctions in one’s\nconcern for people, though the practice of it may begin with\none’s parents (how concern without distinctions is compatible\nwith special burial for one’s parents is unclear, and there is\nno further clarification in 3A5, but the issue involves the question\nof what Mohists meant by jian ai, which is addressed in\nsection 3 below). Mencius’s counter-reply is to ask whether Yizi\nreally holds that a person loves his elder brother’s son no more\nthan his neighbor’s baby. This is not just an assertion about\nwhat people tend to feel but also an assertion about what people\nintuitively hold to be right to feel and to do. Then Mencius makes a\npuzzling remark to the effect that Yizi is singling out a special\nfeature in a certain case: “when a new-born babe creeps toward a\nwell, it is not its fault.” This last part of Mencius’s\nresponse is puzzling because Yizi did not say anything about a baby\nand a well. One possibility is that Yizi may have obliquely referred\nto Mencius’s claim that all have the original and unlearned\nfeeling of distress at seeing a child about to fall into a well. In\nother words, Yizi might have been challenging Mencius by asking,\n“Does not your own postulated unlearned compassion require us to\nregard that child the same way, regardless of whose child it\nis?” This way of taking Yizi helps makes sense of\nMencius’s reply. First, he points out what he takes to be the\nindisputably greater affection one feels for elder brother’s son\nover one’s neighbor’s baby. Mencius grants that we all\nrespond to a child about to fall into the well with alarm and\ndistress, and it doesn’t matter whose child it is. However, one\ncannot infer from this one particular situation that we ought to have\nequal concern for everyone in all situations. The case of the\nchild about to fall into the well has a particular feature that makes\nit relevant to treat it as one would any child. That feature seems to\nbe innocence. \nThe Mencian position is premised on the principle that it is right to\ntreat all people alike only when the ways they are alike are the most\nethically relevant features of the situation. We should do the same\nthing only when the similarities between two cases are the most\nethically relevant features of the situation. Mencius believes that in\nmany instances, the presence or absence of a family relationship to a\nperson is the most relevant feature (in deciding which children to\ngive gifts, the fact that one child is one’s elder\nbrother’s son and the other child is one’s\nneighbor’s child may be the most relevant feature). In other\ntypes of situations, such as a child about to fall into a well, it is\nthe innocence that children share that is the most relevant feature.\nThat is why it is proper to feel alarm or distress toward any child in\nthat situation. The implied application of this idea to the\nsage-kings’ treatment of the people is that these kings treated\nall people alike insofar as they did not deserve the harm about to\nbefall them. \nTwo issues arise from this response to Mohism as he understood it\n(whether he understood it correctly will be addressed in section 3).\nOne issue is whether Mencius has sufficient warrant to trust the kinds\nof intuitive judgments he attributes to human nature. Mencius holds\nthat the beginnings of morality are sent by Heaven, but in the absence\nof such a metaphysical warrant, can these intuitive judgments be\naccepted, particularly the ones that underwrite care with\ndistinctions? Doubt about the metaphysical warrant may not doom\nMencius’s response to Mohism, however, if one holds that all\nnormative theories ultimately depend on intuitive judgments and if one\nhas no good reason to be skeptical about these judgments. Thus one\nmight hold that whether or not there is a metaphysical warrant, there\nis a great deal of plausibility to the intuitive judgment about owing\nparents more concern because they are the source of one’s life\nand nurturance. Of course one might also hold, as Mencius appears to\nhold, that people are owed concern in virtue of their being human, and\nthe possibility for conflict of duties arises from these different\nsources of concern. The second issue is how the Mencius text\ndeals with conflicts of the sort exemplified by the sheep-stealing\ncase in the Analects. \nThe text contains themes embodying the theme of filial loyalty, and as\nin the Analects, such loyalty takes precedence over public\njustice. 7A35 tells a story about the sage-emperor Shun that\nillustrates this theme. Because Shun was renowned for his filiality,\nMencius is asked what Shun would have done if his father killed a man.\nMencius replies that Shun could not stop the judge from apprehending\nhis father because the judge had the legal authority to act. But then,\nMencius says, Shun would have abdicated and fled with his father to\nthe edge of the sea. 5A2 and 5A3 describe the way that Shun dealt with\nhis half-brother Xiang’s conspiring with his father and\nstepmother to kill him. He enfeoffed Xiang because all he could do as\na brother is to love him. At the same time, Shun appointed officials\nto administer the fief and to collect taxes and tributes, to protect\nthe people of Youbi from Xiang’s potentially abusive ruling.\nThat is why some called Shun’s act a banishment of Xiang.\nHowever, the Shun stories exhibit a complexity that differentiates\nthem from the story of the sheep-stealing coverup in the\nAnalects. Though filial loyalty is clearly given a priority\nin each story, there is in Shun’s actions an acknowledgment of\nthe other value that comes into conflict with filial loyalty. Though\nShun ultimately gives priority to filial loyalty in the case of his\nfather, his first action acknowledges the value of public justice by\ndeclining to interfere with the judge while he is king. While Shun\ndeclines to punish his half-brother, he protects the people of\nXiang’s new fiefdom. \nThese Shun stories illustrate that an agent’s response to a\nsituation in which important values come into conflict need not be a\nstrict choice between honoring one value and wholly denying the other.\nWhile some sort of priority might have to be set in the end, there are\nalso ways to acknowledge the value that is subordinated, but how\nexactly that is to be done seems very much a matter of judgment in the\nparticular situation at hand. The Shun stories are an expression of\nthe Confucian theme that rightness cannot be judged on the basis of\nexceptionless general principles but a matter of judgment in the\nparticular situation. It is difficult to see how this theme can be\ntaught except by the way it is done in the Mencius: through\nexemplars of how it is done, and where the situation is presented\nthrough some kind of narrative. \nThe characteristic form of reasoning in Mencius is analogical\nreasoning (see Lau, 1970b; Wong, 2002). Starting from what seems true\nin one case and “extending” similar conclusions to another\ncase that has similar conclusions. The trick in doing analogical\nreasoning correctly, as suggested earlier, is to extend the similar\nconclusions only when the two cases share ethically relevant and\ndecisive features. The Mencius 4A17 shows a similar concern\nfor treating like cases alike. Mencius grants that to save the life of\none’s drowning sister-in-law, one of course suspends the\ncustomary rule of propriety prohibiting the touching of man and woman\nwhen they are giving and receiving. Another philosopher proposes to\napply this idea of suspending the usual rules of propriety to save\nsomething else from drowning—the entire Empire! Mencius replies\nthat one saves one’s sister-in-law with one’s hand but\ncannot save the Empire from drowning in chaos and corruption with\none’s hand. The Empire can only be pulled out by the Way.\nMencius is rejecting the analogy between compromising on ritual\npropriety to save the country and compromising on propriety to save\none’s sister-in-law. There is a relevant dissimilarity between\nthe case of the drowning sister-in-law and saving the country: one\ncannot save the Empire through compromises of ritual propriety, but\ninstead by following the Way, which itself involves following ritual\npropriety. \nSo what do we do when we confront a problematic case in the present\nand we do not automatically know what the right thing to do is?\nMencius believes we can rely on past cases in which we have made\nreliable judgments about, for example, what is right and shameful.\nThese reliable judgments made in past cases serve as paradigms or\nexemplars of correct ethical judgment. In encountering new\nproblem situations, we determine what sort of ethical reaction to the\nnew situation is correct by asking which of the cases in which\nwe’ve had paradigm judgments are relevantly similar. We then\ndetermine what reactions to the new situations would be sufficiently\nsimilar to the relevant paradigm judgments. Analogical reasoning is\ncareful attention and comparing to a concrete paradigm. The\npool of paradigm ethical judgments we have not only includes cases\nfrom our own personal experience, but also include the experience of\nothers, especially those who serve as models of wise judgment. The\nstories of sage-king Shun in the Mencius text seem to give us\nsuch paradigms. Shun’s judgments on what to do about conflicts\nbetween filial loyalty and public justice are perhaps meant to serve\nas paradigm judgments. The conception of moral reasoning found in the\nMencius offers important material for reflection on the\nprocess of moral judgment, especially for those who have come to\nreject the simple model of judgment as deduction from premises\nincluding a general moral principle and a description of the\nconditions that make the principle applicable to the situation at\nhand. The Mencian picture includes general moral considerations or\nvalues that bear on the situation at hand, such as the importance of\nfamily loyalty and public justice, but the picture also suggests that\njudgment in difficult situations includes finding a way to adequate\nrecognize and realize the values in play. “Finding a way”\nseems much more a matter of imagination and ingenuity rather than\ndeduction, but the Mencian picture also suggests that we can be guided\nby exemplars of wise judgment. Identifying the relevant similarities\nand dissimilarities between these exemplars and one’s present\nsituation seems a matter of perception and close attention rather than\ndeduction from principle. \nIn the Xing E (“[Human] Nature is Bad”) chapter,\nXunzi explicitly opposes his position on human nature to\nMencius’s. He asserts that far from being good, human nature is\nbad because it includes a love of profit, envy and hatred, and desires\nof the eyes and ears that lead to violence and anarchy. To avoid these\nconsequences of indulging our spontaneous desires and impulses, it\ntakes wei (conscious activity or deliberate effort), models\nand teaching, and guidance through observing ritual and yi\n(standards of righteousness). Through such efforts, natural emotions\nand desires are transformed as a crooked piece of wood is steamed and\nthen straightened upon a press frame. All rituals and standards of\nrighteousness are sheng (generated, produced) by the sages.\nThese are generated from the conscious activity of the sages and not\nfrom their original nature. Just as the vessel made by a potter is\ngenerated from his conscious activity and not his original nature, so\nthe sages accumulated their thoughts and ideas and made a practice of\nconscious activity and precedents, thereby generating rituals and\nstandards of righteousness. \nPart of Xunzi’s argument against Mencius is that human nature is\nnot what is produced by conscious activity but rather that which is\nalready there in human beings independently of conscious activity.\nSince it is clear that human beings are not already good but must work\nat it, it is clear that human nature cannot be good. When Mencius is\nattributed the water-metaphor view of the human inclination toward\ngoodness, Xunzi’s criticism has a point. Becoming good does not\nseem to be merely a matter of not interfering with what will unfold in\nnormal circumstances. However, when Mencius is attributed the\nsprout-metaphor view, the differences between him and Xunzi are more\nsubtle. On the sprout-metaphor view, effort and reflection must be put\ninto the project of extending the sprouts to where they should be. It\nmight be thought that one of the real differences between Mencius and\nXunzi is that the former believes the necessary effort lies in growing\nor extending what lies in human nature, whereas the latter believes\nthat the effort lies in remaking and reshaping what lies in human\nnature. Perhaps one believes that we can go “with the\ngrain” of what we are born with, and the other believes we must\ngo “against the grain.”  \nEach thinker emphasizes one of these opposing directions, but\nit is a credit to the subtlety and power of their views that each also\ntakes into account the direction that the other emphasizes. Mencius\nacknowledges that moral development is hindered when a person pays\nmore attention to the “small” parts of the self that\ninclude desires for sensual and material satisfaction and fails to use\nthe heart-mind to reflect on the great parts that have normative\npriority. In the chapter on rituals, Xunzi identifies natural and\npowerful emotional dispositions such as love of one’s own kind\nthat rituals must give expression to and that seem to form more of a\npositive basis for moral development. Such natural love is expressed\nin love for parents and intense grief upon their deaths, which must be\ngiven appropriate expression in mourning and burial rituals. Thus\nMencius acknowledges that there are natural parts of the self that\nmust be disciplined and held in check while Xunzi acknowledges that\nthere are natural parts that are largely congenial to morality in the\nsense that they are the natural basis for taking great satisfaction\nand contentment in virtue once one has gotten the self-aggrandizing\ndesires and emotions under control.  \nAnother disagreement between Mencius and Xunzi has to do with\nMencius’ claim that human nature contains moral predispositions.\nAs indicated earlier, such Mencian predispositions appear to contain\nmoral intuitions (e.g., about what is shameful and right or wrong). On\none plausible interpretation of Mencius, morality is part of the order\nimparted to the world by tian or heaven. By contrast, Xunzi\nseems to rule out the existence of natural predispositions with moral\ncontent when he claims that the sage kings generated ritual principles\nand precepts of moral duty. One natural interpretation of\n“generated” is “created” or\n“invented.” On these interpretations of each thinker, the\ncontrast between Mencius and Xunzi exemplifies the contrast between a\nrobust moral realism that has moral properties such as rightness\nexisting independently of human invention and a constructivist\nposition that makes moral properties dependent on human invention.\n \nThe interpretation of Xunzi as a constructivist does not necessarily\ncommit him to a denial of the objectivity of morality or to the denial\nthat there is a single objectively correct morality. It is possible to\nsee Xunzi as a constructivist about morality but also as an\nobjectivist (see Nivison, 1991). On the constructivist interpretation,\nXunzi holds a functional conception of morality, according to which it\nis invented to harmonize the interests of individuals and to constrain\nand transform the heedless pursuit of short-term gratification for the\nsake of promoting the long-term interests of the individual and the\ngroup. Ritual principles and moral precepts are invented to accomplish\nsuch a function, and human nature constrains which of the possible\nprinciples and precepts are better or worse for accomplishing that\nfunction. Xunzi’s point about the mourning rituals prescribed by\nConfucians being suited to the nature of human love for one’s\nparents is a case in point. \nXunzi’s functional theory of morality bears added interest for\nthose exploring the possibilities of a naturalistic approach to\nmorality. One fairly common interpretation of Xunzi’s conception\nof tian or heaven is that it is an order-giving force in the\ncosmos that is neutral to whatever human beings have come to regard as\nright and good. In fact, a translation that better conveys such a\nmeaning for ‘tian’ is “nature,” which\nis the translation given by Knoblock’s valued translation of the\nXunzi. Textual passages that support this interpretation\nstress that tian operates according to patterns that remain\nconstant no matter what human beings do or whether they appeal to it\nfor good fortune (chapter 17). It is the proper task of human beings\nto understand what these patterns are in order to take advantage of\nthem (e.g., so that they may know to plow in the spring, weed in the\nsummer, harvest in the fall, and store in the winter). \nSuch a view of the difference between Xunzi and Mencius, however,\ndepends on interpretations that been disputed in favor of alternative\ninterpretations. Roger Ames (1991, 2002) defends an interpretation of\nMencius that gives the greatest role in shaping the direction of moral\ndevelopment to human “creative social intelligence” rather\nthan tian conceived as a force operating independently of\nhuman beings. For a contrasting view, see Irene Bloom (1994, 1997,\n2002), who, sometimes in response to Ames, defends a greater role for\nbiology in her interpretation of Mencius while also leaving an\nimportant role for culture. The Xunzi text is also\nsusceptible to very different interpretations, partly because of the\noriginality of its synthesis of several streams of thought:\nConfucianism, Daoism, Mohism, and the Jixia Academy. When Xunzi\nasserts that tian is unresponsive to human supplication and\nritual sacrifice, it looks as if he might be drawing from Daoism (see\nbelow), but when he refers to the tian-given faculties human\nbeings should exercise to solve the problem of conflict, he might be\ninterpreted as implying that tian conferred these faculties\nupon human beings for the purpose of solving the problem of\nconflict and realizing fulfilling human lives together (see Eno 1990;\nand Machle, 1993 for an exploration of the rich interpretive\npossibilities regarding Xunzi’s conception of tian).\nWhile it might still be possible to interpret Xunzi as a\nconstructivist on the origin of morality, this alternative\ninterpretation might suggest that Xunzi’s tian had a\nblueprint it intended human beings to fulfill. Under alternative\ninterpretations of Mencius and Xunzi, then, the differences do not\ndisappear, but they might form even more subtle contrasts (Wong,\n2016). \nEven some of the theoretical difficulties that Xunzi has are\ninstructive. In pressing his case against Mencius for the badness of\nhuman nature, he stresses the self-serving drives of human nature.\nUnlike Hobbes, he does not accept that human beings are inevitably\nmotivated by self-interest, and he does not try to base adherence to\nmoral norms on the basis of self-interest alone. This arguably is a\npromising move, given the heavy criticism that can be directed against\nthe Hobbesian project and subsequent attempts to carry it out its\nbasic idea (see Gauthier, 1986 for such an attempt; see Vallentyne,\n1991 for criticism). Xunzi rather argues that the problems created by\nunrestrained self-interest point to the need to transform human\nmotivation. People can come to love moral virtue and the rites for\ntheir own sakes, and this is necessary, on Xunzi’s view, for a\nstable solution to the problem of conflict between self-interested\nindividuals. At times, Xunzi suggests that the intellect can override\nthe desires arising from the natural emotions, but it remains unclear\nas to how self-regarding motivations can become a love of virtue and\nthe rites simply because the intellect approves of them. The parts of\nXunzi asserting a more complex picture of human motivation suggest a\nsolution. If human beings are capable of genuine compassion and\nconcern for others, as the chapter on rites suggests, then the ritual\nprinciples and moral precepts invented by the sage kings have some\nmotivational leverage for the birth of a love of virtue and rites.\nSuch a solution draws from what are arguably some of the most\nplausible positions of Mencius: that human beings are capable of\naltruism and compassion even if they are motivated much of the time by\nself-interest; and that moral transformation is a matter of\ncultivating and extending a motivational substance that is congenial\nto morality (see Wong, 2000). \nMencius and Xunzi, then, offer sophisticated theories that expand the\nrange of possible ways of understanding moral knowledge, motivation,\nand the nature of morality itself. Mencius presents an interesting\nconception of the way that we reason by analogy from intuitive\njudgments and also a plausible conception of innate predispositions\nthat are compatible with a major role for learning and upbringing in\nthe development of character and virtue. Those who are more\nnaturalistically inclined in their approach to morality (at least\ninsofar as this involves resisting the idea of a transcendent source\nof moral properties) may find the interpretation of Xunzi as offering\na functional conception of morality appealing, especially if it allows\nfor a degree of objectivity regarding the content of morality. \nIn recent years, Gilbert Harman (1998–99, 1999–2000) and\nJohn Doris (2002) have pointed to the influence of situations over\nattitude and behavior as a problem for virtue ethics. Citing empirical\nwork in social psychology, Harman and Doris claim that the extensive\nand surprising influence of situational factors undermines the\ncommonsense idea that people possess stable character traits that\nexplain what they do. Some of the classic psychological studies used\nin this argument appear to show that ordinary respectable American\ncitizens will administer dangerous electrical shocks to an innocent\nperson when urged to do so by an experimenter in a lab coat (Milgram\n1974), and that being late for an appointment is the most influential\nfactor in whether a seminary student will stop and help someone who\nseems to be falling ill, even if the appointment is to attend a\nlecture on the Good Samaritan (Darley and Batson 1973). Such studies\npose a problem not only for the commonsense conception of character\ntraits, but also for virtue ethics, which appear to assume the\npossibility of achieving stable character traits that are virtues.\nPerhaps human beings are inevitably creatures who are influenced by\nthe situation in which they act and not by any characterlogical\ndispositions they bring with them to the situation. If so, it appears\nthat the ideal of attaining virtues is misguided. \nThere are good reasons to expect Confucianism to offer some\ndistinctive resources for dealing with this problem. First, as pointed\nout in 2.3, Confucians appreciate the relational nature of human life:\nwho we are as persons very much includes our social context: the\npeople with whom we are in relationship and our institutions and\npractices. So they are very much in a position to appreciate\nsituational influences on how human beings think, feel, and act.\nSecond, they appear to hold something like a conception of virtues as\nstable character traits that are resistant to undue situational\ninfluences. As noted in 2.3, and this pertains to the challenge posed\nby the Milgram study, the Confucians emphasize the importance of\nliving according to one’s own understanding of what is right and\ngood even if others do not see it the same way. Third, as noted at the\nbeginning of this entry, Chinese philosophy in general is\ndistinguished by a focus on the practical. This is illustrated in the\nConfucian case by the tradition of scholar-officials who not only\nwrote about and taught the importance of the ethical to the political\nlife, but strove to enact this importance in their own careers. As a\nconsequence, they were very much concerned with specifying in\npractical terms how one could go about cultivating the virtues in\noneself. Fourth, and this is very much in response to the combination\nof the previous points, they describe a long and arduous program of\nethical training to inculcate the virtues. \nAs Edward Slingerland (2011) has put it, Confucianism is in a good\nposition to appreciate the “high bar” challenge of\nsituational influence to the project of cultivating the virtues in\noneself and others. In response to this challenge, their program of\nethical training includes study of the classics (after the ancient\nperiod, the classics came to include, of course, the Analects\nand the Mencius), memorized and rehearsed until they become\nfully internalized and embedded in the unconscious patterns of thought\nthat are so powerful in shaping what we do in everyday life (see\nSlingerland 2009). This is one characteristic pattern of Confucian\nself-cultivation: one consciously, deliberately and assiduously\nundertakes a program that inculcates dispositions to have ethically\nappropriate emotional responses and patterns of conduct. The intent is\nto make the dispositions for these responses reliable and resistant to\nundue situational influence. \nFurthermore, the Confucians very much appreciated the power of models\nto inspire, to make one want to transcend one’s present self.\nThe psychologist Jonathan Haidt (2003) has given empirical evidence\nfor an emotion he calls “elevation,” which is something\nlike awe and admiration upon contemplating the morally admirable. The\nAnalects, in fact, has been read as a record of how a group of\nmen gathered around a teacher with the power to elevate, and as a\nrecord of how this group created a culture in which goals of\nself-transformation were treated as collaborative projects. These\npeople not only discussed the nature of self-cultivation but enacted\nit as a relational process in which they supported one another,\nreinforced their common goals, and served as checks on each other in\ncase they went off the path, the dao. They were each\nother’s situational influences. See Sarkissian, 2010 for the\nargument that Confucius shows how one can turn the power of situations\non people’s attitudes and behavior toward positive ends; if\nsituations can influence people, one can through small details of\ncomportment and attitude be a situational influence on others that\ntilts things toward a better course. \nTraining in ritual, li, takes on another dimension of\nimportance in light of the situationist problem. As noted in section\n2.2 Confucian rituals help to express attitudes of respect and\nreverence for others that can exist independently of the rituals\nthemselves, but rituals provide conventionally established, symbolic\nways to express these attitudes toward others. Ritual forms,\ntherefore, give participants manifold and (just as importantly)\nregularly recurring ways to act on and therefore to strengthen the\nright attitudes and behavioral dispositions. Given the renewed\nappreciation in contemporary psychology for the power of emotions to\ninfluence attitude and behavior, the resource offered by ritual\ntraining should not be ignored by anyone concerned about the problem\nof how to resist undue situational influence. \nFinally, Confucianism points to the possibility that individuals,\nunder the right circumstances and encouragement, can enhance their\nreflective control of their own emotions and impulses. Mencius’\nconversation with King Xuan can be conceived as an attempt to get the\nking to nourish his moral sprouts by reflecting on them, to become\naware of what his moral emotions are (such as compassion) and to take\naction to grow them. It should be noted that contemporary psychology\nis exploring some possible venues for the regulation of one’s\nemotions and impulses. See Walter Mischel’s by-now classic study\n(1989) of children who are able to defer gratification for greater\nreward in the future (here’s one marshmallow; if you can wait\nfifteen minutes before you eat it you can have another one). It turns\nout the effective delayers use strategies of diverting their\nattentional focus from the marshmallow sitting in front of them.\nProjects are underway to teach children these strategies. See\nLieberman (2011) and Creswell (2007) for studies indicating that\nmeditation focused on cultivating compassion in oneself can be\neffective through enhancing one’s ability to identify and gain\nbetter control of one’s emotions. \nFinally, in considering why robust character traits that could qualify\nas virtues are so rare, we should consider the perspective that very\nmuch informs the self-cultivation projects of Confucius and his\nstudents. They were very much aware of the lack of virtue as a social\nand political condition and not merely as an individual condition that\njust happened to be widespread (Hutton 2006 makes this point). There\nis a reason why Confucius and Mencius after him sought to have kings\nadopt their teachings. If in fact the achievement of robust virtues\nrequires long and hard training, supported and guided by others who\nhave taken similar paths before, and if as Mencius 1A7 holds, people\ncannot engage in such training until they have the material security\nthat enables them to take their minds off the sheer task of survival,\nthen it is no mystery at all why there are no such traits in societies\nstructured to achieve very different goals. Ironically, the\nsituationist psychological experiments do not take into account this\nunderlying relational factor that might deeply influence the ability\nof people to form robust virtues, and neither do the philosophical\ncritics of virtue ethics who rely on the situationist experimental\nevidence. \nZhu Xi (1130–1200) reinterpreted ethical themes inherited from\nthe classical thinkers and grounded them in a cosmology and\nmetaphysics that had absorbed the influence of Buddhism, particularly\nas it transformed in its interaction with Daoism when entering China\n(see the chapters on Zhu Xi and Wang Yang Ming in Ivanhoe, 1993 for\nthe neo-Confucian reaction Buddhism and Daoism). Zhu established the\nConfucian canon that served as a basis for the Chinese public service\nexamination, including the Analects and Mencius,\nalong with the Great Learning (Da Xue) and\nDoctrine of the Mean (Zhong Yong). In fact, he had\nhis greatest influence through the commentaries he wrote on these\ntexts (see Gardner, 2003 for a discussion of the influence of Zhu\nXi’s reading of the Analects). Zhu affirmed the Mencian\ntheme that human nature is good, with greater emphasis on that vein of\nthought in the Mencius that stresses that goodness is\ninternal to human beings and will develop in the absence of\ninterference. This reading of Mencius is unsurprising given the\ninfluence of Buddhism on the Neo-Confucians, and it meant the demotion\nof Xunzi within the influential Neo-Confucian reading of the\ntradition. Much of Zhu’s metaphysics centers on the relation\nbetween li (in this case not ritual but principle or pattern\nor the fit and coherence between things) and qi (the material\nforce or energy stuff from which objects emerge and return at the end\nof their existence). How Zhu Xi conceived this relation is a matter of\ninterpretive debate. Some view him as holding a dualistic metaphysics\nin analogy to the way that Plato’s distinction between the Forms\nand the sensible world is often taken to embody a metaphysical dualism\n(Fung, 1948, chapter 25). However, others interpret Zhu’s\nli not as ontologically prior to qi but rather as\nbeing a pattern or deep structure that is immanent within and\nexpressed by qi and delineates the range and possibilities of\nqi’s transformations (Graham, 1986; Thompson, 1988;\nAngle and Tiwald, 2017; Liu, 2018). Others have noted that li\nappears to have both subjective and objective aspects: it lays down\nthe lines along which everything moves in a way that is independent of\npersonal desires; but on the other hand, it is related to the pattern\nof one’s profoundest responses to things (see Angle, 2009, for\nan attempt to reconcile these aspects). With regard to qi,\nZhu Xi held that even though goodness is within human nature,\nindividuals differed with respect to their native endowment of energy\nstuff, and that this, together with differences in their family and\nsocial circumstances, affected the development of their good natures\n(Angle and Tiwald, 2017; Liu, 2018).  \nZhu Xi saw one’s self-cultivation as a matter of apprehending\nthe li of one’s own mind, largely through meditation\npractice, and, at the same time, investigating the li or\npatterns of things not only as revealed in texts such as the\nAnalects but as embodied in concrete situations, including\nthe patterns in relationships between persons. Both kinds of\nactivities must be conducted with jing, which in Zhu’s\nthought means respectful attention. Zhu is sometimes characterized as\na kind of scholastic, but he emphasized study of the texts in\nconjunction with acting, with observing li in external\nsituations and relationships, and realizing the correspondence between\nthe li of one’s own mind and the li of texts\nand of situations and relationships. Apprehending li in a\nconcrete situation in order to respond appropriately to it was not a\nsimple matter of absorbing generalizations from texts and applying it\nto the situation, but rather a matter of bringing to bear a mind that\nhas been cultivated by meditation and by study of the texts and by\nobserving and acting in previous situations. Such a mind can take into\naccount relevant ethical considerations and is disciplined in\nattending to the situation (see the chapter on Zhu Xi in Ivanhoe,\n1993; and Gardner, 1990). \nThe other Neo-Confucian whose influence rivals that of Zhu Xi is Wang\nYang Ming (1472–1529). Wang saw Zhu’s emphasis on the\ninvestigation of patterns in external things as overly scholastic and\nleading to abstract speculation rather than practical guidance. He\nrejected what he saw to be the intellectualization of personal\nrealization, and identified the mind with li (xin ji\nli or mind is pattern or principle). This means that the\ndispositions to judge properly the appropriate action in various\nsituations constitute the mind’s original pure state.\nLi is not to be sought as a pattern residing in an\nindependently existing external world but is embodied in judgments of\nthe mind. This seems to commit Wang to an identification of the world\nwith the experienced world and to a denial of a mind-independent\nworld, but an alternative interpretation is that the structure of the\nworld is mind-dependent while the world itself is not (Liu, 2018).\nWang’s version of the Mencian theme that human nature is good is\neven more innatist than Zhu Xi’s (see Ivanhoe, 1990, for a\ncomparison of Mencius and Wang Yang Ming). Original goodness does not\nneed completion through learning about the external world. Then why\naren’t all people fully good? Why are some very bad?\nWang’s answer is that selfish desires cloud the sun of the\ncomplete and perfect moral mind, and that the task of human beings is\nto eliminate selfish desires and recover that mind (Chan, 1963,\nsections 21, 62). \nOne of Wang’s better-known themes is the unity of knowledge and\naction. There can be no gap between knowing what to do and doing it.\nGenuine knowledge is necessarily practical. Selfish desires and\nemotions get in the way of achieving genuine knowledge. One way of\nunderstanding this identification is to take knowledge as a knowing\nhow to act that is expressed in acting. One expresses one’s\nknowing how to ride a bicycle by riding, not by articulating\npropositions about how to ride a bicycle that one might not be able to\nact upon. Furthermore, knowledge is particularist and\ncontext-sensitive in nature and is expressed in intuitive reactions to\nthe present moment. Knowing how to ride a bicycle is continually\nreacting by shifting one’s body first this way and then that way\nto the changing center of gravity of one’s body in tandem with\nthe bicycle. The moral life, on Wang’s view, is like that rather\nthan applying a static set of generalizations one learns before\nencountering the situations in which one needs to act. Notice also\nthat the kinesthetic sensations blend seamlessly with the bodily\nresponses to those sensations that help one to go forward and keep\none’s balance on a bicycle. In genuine moral knowledge,\nperception of the situation at hand blends seamlessly with the right\nresponse to it. \nIn emphasizing that the ultimate ideal is a kind of spontaneous and\nintuitive perceiving of the situation and the right response to it,\nWang Yang Ming joins with Zhu Xi. However, this does not mean that\nthere were not important dissenting voices. Dai Zhen defended an\nethical ideal in which deliberative reflection on the right thing to\ndo continues to play an important role and not just at stages in which\none is a considerable distance from realizing the ideal. Dai\nparticularly emphasizes the necessity for imagining the effects of\none’s actions on others, which might help one better share their\nsorrows and joys. Whereas Zhu equated spontaneous and non-conscious\nidentification with others as a reflection of the wholeheartedness of\none’s motivations, Dai counters that needing to deliberate over\nthe right thing to do is compatible with a wholehearted acting on\none’s judgment when one arrives at it. Dai is inclined to give\ndesires for the self a legitimate place in ethical reflection because\nhe holds that one’s valuing of relationships can be strengthened\nwhen one understands that the other’s flourishing is tied up\nwith one’s own (see Tiwald 2010, 2011a, 2011b). \nMany contemporary philosophers who have seriously undertaken the study\nof Confucian ethics have concluded that it remains a\n“live” philosophy with insights of continuing relevance. A\nfull defense of this claim requires not only identifying what is\nvaluable in Confucian ethics but also addressing moral evils and\nliabilities that have long been associated with it (the same should be\nsaid of Aristotle and his views of women and slaves, or Kant, and his\nviews of women or people of African descent). For example, Confucian\nethics might be seen as providing a needed emphasis on the central\nvalue of relationship in most, if not all, human lives that are worth\nliving. In response to the Socratic claim that the unexamined life is\nnot worth living, the Confucian might be on at least equal footing in\nsaying that an isolated life is not worth living. Yet the Confucian is\nalso required to examine what sorts of relationships should have this\nhigh status. Does Confucianism require family relationships that are\npatriarchal, with the husband and father exercising authority over\nwife and children in ways that would inevitably offend values of\nequality and autonomy? \nA recurring theme in the more recent literature on this subject is\nthat views of women in the early period of Confucianism were\nrelatively positive compared to the views adopted later. Raphals\n(1998) has extracted from the literature of the Warring States Period\n(during which Confucius lived) and the later Han Dynasty portraits of\nwomen who were active and sometimes very effective participants in\ntheir societies. For example, the “Collected Life Stories of\nWomen” (Lienu zhuan) depicts women as having the same\nintellectual virtues as men, providing strategy and counsel to their\nrulers, husbands, fathers and sons, excelling in logic and argument,\nand presenting sagely wisdom. Nylan reads classical Chinese texts as\ntalking “with almost stunning clarity of the power for good and\nevil that women bring to politics” (2000, 212), and she\nconcludes that “[o]ur stereotypes of ancient China do not come\nso much from … [these texts] as from relatively recent sources,\nthe Neo-Confucians and the May Fourth reformers” (2000, 213). At\nthe same time, it must be said that the powerful women of ancient\nChina were almost always excluded from official positions of power and\nauthority. \nSin Yee Chan (2000) presents a portrait consistent with Raphals’\nand Nylan’s from looking at the Analects and the\nMencius. It is assumed in those texts that the proper roles\nfor women lie in the inner, domestic sphere, and for men the outer,\npublic sphere. This distinction, argues Chan, is functional and\nconceived as obtaining between complementary roles, not between women\nand men conceived as inferior and superior. But the consignment of\nwomen to the inner sphere does exclude them from one of the most\ncentral aspirations of the junzi, which is to serve in public\noffice. It also excludes them from receiving the education that is a\npreparation for office. At the same time, there is no attempt to\njustify the exclusion of women from this aspiration, and no argument\ngiven in these texts that they possess lesser capabilities for\nachieving that aspiration, no conception of women as having inferior\ncapacities for the development of strategic intelligence, moral\nwisdom, or self-discipline.  \nThe inference is to the possibility of a version of Confucian ethics\nthat fully acknowledges the capabilities of women to become\njunzi and that supports opportunities for them to achieve\nthat ideal. Some who are sympathetic to this line of development for\nConfucian ethics have argued for its significant affinities with some\nstrains of feminist thought. Consider ren in its meaning as\nthe particular virtue of care for others. Chenyang Li (1994) has\nargued that there are important similarities between this central\nConfucian virtue and the feminist ethic of care articulated by Carol\nGilligan (1982) and Nell Noddings (1984). Furthermore, both Confucian\nand feminist care ethics have conceptions of ethical reasoning that\nemphasize contextualized reasoning about moral problems rather than\ndeducing solutions top-down from high general principles. Li\nacknowledges the patriarchal form that Confucian ethics came to take\non, but stresses that in a contemporary dialogue between these two\nethics, each could have something to contribute to the other. \nRosenlee (2014; also see 2007) addresses a criticism of care ethics of\neither the Confucian or Western feminist sort that has come from some\nfeminist quarters, which is that care is a value pressed upon women so\nthat they might be subordinate helpmates to men. While she\nacknowledges that the value has functioned in this way, she questions\nwhether women should cease caring when “vulnerability and\ninterdependency characterize human existence” (2013, 318).\nShouldn’t they rather insist that men share equitably the task\nof caring? Rosenlee defends the Confucian value of filiality or\nxiao as the root of moral character, starting the project of\ncaring with addressing the vulnerability of the child, then through\nthe stages where a child reciprocates care for parents, and getting\nextended beyond the family.  \nKupperman (2000) holds that Confucian ethics could benefit from\nadopting the feminist recognition that many social roles and the\nrituals that support them need to be reformed and perhaps re-invented\nin some cases, given the limiting and inhibiting effect they have on\nthe life projects women have chosen or could have chosen for\nthemselves (Meyers, 1989). He reads the classical Confucian texts as\nadopting a much more conservative and respectful attitude towards\ntraditional social roles and rituals, and while he has a degree of\nsympathy for this attitude (there can be good reasons why things are\nold enough to be traditional), he concludes that Confucian ethics, if\nit is to fully support opportunities for development of women’s\ncapabilities, must prepare to be radicalized with respect to at least\nsome of the roles and rituals it has defended (see Neville 2017 for\nthe argument that Confucianism is up to the task of seeing the need\nfor new or radically revised rituals in this regard).  \nThe issue of the Confucian orientation to tradition is itself a matter\nof contested interpretation. While the Confucian attitude is\nuncontroversially “conservative” in holding that there is\nmuch wisdom and guidance to be recovered from the past, some lean\ntoward the more extreme Mohist interpretation that Confucians accept\ntradition simply because it is tradition (e.g., Hansen, 1992), while\nothers view the Confucian attitude as a discerning and critical\nattitude toward tradition, citing passages such as Analects\n3.15 in which Confucius says that his own persistent questioning at\nthe Grand Temple is itself an act of li or proper observance\nof ritual (see Alan Chan, 2000). Further, and most importantly,\nConfucius was a pivotal figure in turning the meaning of\n“junzi” from a person of noble blood to a person\nof moral nobility who could come from any background.  \nTo retrieve one’s cultural inheritance is itself a complex,\ncontested task, given the internal diversity of belief and practice\nthat is characteristic of any vibrant tradition. In her account of how\nChinese thinkers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries\napproached the task of bringing to bear Western thought to the reform\nof their own society, Jenco (2015) points out that a crucial part of\ntheir task was to identify what their own cultural inheritance was,\nsuch that it could be brought into relation to a present and future\nthat involved possibly profound transformation. She points out that\n“Confucius offered one of the earliest accounts of how an\norientation to a particular past could be both deliberate and\ntransformative rather than merely descriptive of an established\nidentity,” and that his conception of the Zhou inheritance was\nbut “one of many possible lineages created when the present was\nsutured to that particular past” (Jenco, 2015, 57). Tan (2004,\n82) makes a similar point in claiming that the Confucian “legacy\nis successfully transmitted only when the past is revitalized, so that\nit is embodied in the different experience of the present. Confucius\nconsiders one who “revitalizes the old to realize the new (wengu\ner zhixin)” worthy of being a teacher (Analects 2.11).”\nThose engaged in transforming Confucian ethics in relation to women\ncan view their task as a project of the kind Jenco and Tan are\ndescribing. \nThe relationship between Confucian ethics and liberal democratic\nvalues has received vigorous and diverse discussion starting from the\nlate nineteenth and early twentieth century. This discussion has\ncentered on three kinds of tension: Confucian perfectionism versus\npluralism in the recognition of what constitutes a good and worthwhile\nhuman life; the Confucian value of social harmony versus individual\nrights; and the Confucian value of meritocracy versus the grounding of\na government’s legitimacy in its acceptance by the governed.\n \nJoseph Chan (2014) has classified Confucian ethics, along with much of\nancient Greek ethics, as perfectionist in structure. Many of the\ncentral ethical judgments in Confucianism have to do what what it is\nto live a good human life, and the virtues it takes to live such a\nlife. As indicated earlier, the Confucian conception of a good human\nlife is centered around relationships--within the family, within\nfriendship, and also within a society in which one aspires to serve a\ngovernment by advancing the mission of securing the material and moral\nwelfare of the people. From the standpoint of a contemporary liberal\ndemocratic theory, one might question how much room this leaves people\nto choose among a plurality of reasonable conceptions of the good\nlife. Certainly, many contemporary Americans and Europeans would not\nplace so central an emphasis on family relationship and on filiality\nas Confucians do. Chan (2000, 2014) proposes to defuse this tension\nthrough advocating a moderate Confucian perfectionism that refrains\nfrom promoting a comprehensive view of how people ought to live. The\nliberal argument that conceptions of the good life are too\ncontroversial to be promoted by the state does not apply, he argues,\nto some important constituents of the Confucian conception of how to\nlive--prudential goods and goods necessary for agency. Such goods,\nwhen separated from a comprehensive conception that orders and\nprioritizes them into a particular way of life, can be promoted in\npiecemeal fashion through non-coercive methods in the context of\nparticular issues, and justifications can be given on the basis of\ncommon ground and compromise. \nKim (2016) argues that Chan’s version of moderate Confucian\nperfectionism does not leave enough that is distinctively Confucian.\nFiliality as traditionally understood is tightly associated with a\npatrilineal family/clan structure and with rituals that express gender\nhierarchy, which is why it is the greatest failure of filiality to\nfail to produce a male heir who will continue the male family line and\nwho will conduct the ceremonies of ancestor worship. On the other\nhand, if one does leave enough that is distinctively and traditionally\nConfucian, Kim argues, one will not have a perfectionism that is\nmoderate enough to be compatible with the pluralistic, diverse\ncharacter of contemporary East Asian societies. Kim proposes the\nalternative he calls “public reason Confucianism,” which\nsets traditional Confucianism and the democratic values of popular\nsovereignty, political equality, and the right to political\nparticipation in dialogue with each other. The two sides must\naccommodate to each other. In practice, it seems that the most glaring\ninequalities accepted under traditional Confucianism, including gender\ninequalities that support women’s unequal standing as citizens,\nmust go, though traditionalist Confucian associations retain a degree\nof autonomy to run their affairs and to retain “moderate\ninequalities” when these do not have vital public implications\n(2016, 164). One of the challenges Kim may have to address is whether\nin the dialogue between traditional Confucianism and democratic values\nthere emerges something that is coherent and still distinctively\nConfucian. The previously discussed commentators on Confucianism and\ngender equality illustrate how it might be argued that gender equality\nis more compatible with Confucian values than they are usually thought\nto be. They also raise the issue of what “traditional”\nConfucianism really is, whether it is one thing, and whether it has\nnot always been constantly changing.  \nAngle (2012) addresses the tension between perfectionism and pluralism\nabout the good life by developing an argument he finds in the\ntwentieth century Confucian Mou Zongsan. Mou holds that politics must\nultimately be based on moral values but is concerned about the\nexcesses of governments trying to promote particular conceptions of\nvirtue and the good life. Given the difficulties of achieving ethical\ninsight, even among the most accomplished of human beings, it is\nnecessary to separate to some degree political values from ethical\nvalue. Even a political leader who is a sage must engage in\n“self restriction” (ziwo kanxian). In practice,\nAngle explains, self-restriction means putting in place democratic\ninstitutions and the recognition of human rights. This not only sets\nup guardrails to keep political leaders from going badly off track,\nbut also provides citizens the opportunity to participation in public\nlife that is needed to advance their own ethical insight and further\nrealize good character. \nTan (2003) argues that Confucian methods for encouraging the\nrealization of virtues are non-coercive because its conception of the\ngood life is process-oriented and fallibilistic, and its conception of\npersonhood is social and relational. Human beings become persons\nthrough processes of relationship with each other, by contributing to\neach other’s ethical growth. What growth amounts to is something\nthat can be meaningfully judged only within the particular\ncircumstances and the processes that have led up to the present. A\nfigure such as Confucius has authority not just because of who he is\nbut because others respond to him with spontaneous acceptance,\nadmiration, and emulation. Since Tan holds that these Confucian\nconceptions are eminently plausible, she argues that not only is\nConfucianism compatible with democracy, but that democracy needs to\nincorporate the insights of Confucianism. In the Western tradition,\nshe finds in John Dewey a thinker who is sympathetic to these\ninsights. \nIn section 2.3, it was suggested that Confucianism posits a\nfundamental harmony between individual and group interests, and that\nthere are ways in which Confucianism values autonomy and ways it does\nnot. These points have ramifications for the issue of whether\nConfucianism can recognize individual rights. Given the way that\nindividual and group interests are conceived as mutually dependent and\ninterwoven, Confucianism cannot recognize rights on the grounds that\nthe individual’s interests inevitably conflict with group\ninterests. Furthermore, Confucians might have a legitimate concern\nthat an emphasis on individual rights, as things that can be claimed\nagainst the group, tends to encourage people to think of their\ninterests as incompatible with the interests of others. \nThese considerations should hold some weight for Confucians, but so do\nsome other considerations that support protections for individuals.\nConfucianism can recognize that individuals do not always accurately\nperceive or act on the fundamental compatibility between individual\nand group interests. Rights might be necessary in case relationships\nirretrievably break down and individuals need to be protected. Joseph\nChan (1999, 2014) has made this very point for rights as\n“fallback” mechanisms. One might go further than Chan does\nand give rights a more prominent place if one expects regular\nmisfiring on attempts to reconcile individual and group interests\n(e.g., see Fan 2010, Wong 2004). If in fact it can be a difficult\nmatter to tell how to promote fundamental harmony between\npeople’s interests, and if political leaders tend to have their\njudgment about this matter compromised by the influence of some of\ntheir own personal interests and by the sheer fact of holding power\n(there is evidence that one becomes less sensitive to other\npeople’s interests the longer one holds power over them), there\nmay be good reason to recognize rights to free speech that can be used\nby citizens to call office holders to account and to make their own\ninterests more salient. Providing these protections under the heading\nof rights may help to protect citizens when the content of their\nspeech concerns the wrongful or misconceived conduct and policies of\nan office holder. (Wong, 2004).  \nAngle’s argument, inspired by Mou Zongsan’s idea of\nself-restriction, has a similar logic of pointing to human fallibility\nas a warrant for rights. A more positive justification for rights\nmight be rooted in Confucian values. As mentioned earlier, Angle\n(2012) argues that participation in public affairs is necessary for\nadvancing the cultivation of one’s character. Kim (2016) argues\nfor equal rights of political participation based in the Mencian view\nthat all human beings have the moral sprouts within their nature. What\nkept Mencius from recognizing an equal right to participation is his\ncommitment to the sage-king paradigm of government, but such an\narrangement is a non-starter for even contemporary East Asian\nsocieties with a substantial Confucian heritage. \nIndeed, if one goes back to the classical Confucian notion of harmony\ndiscussed in section 2.3, there is a basis for ensuring room for a\ndiversity of viewpoints. Harmony is not sameness of viewpoint but\nmakes use of diversity of viewpoint. In Analects 9.30,\nConfucius states the inevitability of what we today might call\n“reasonable disagreement:” “The Master said, “You\ncan study with some, and yet not necessarily walk the same path\n(dao); you can walk the same path as some, and yet not\nnecessarily take your stand with them; you can take your stand with\nthem, and yet not necessarily weigh things up in the same way”\n(translation from Ames and Rosemont, 2010). \nPositive arguments for rights based on the goal of promoting the\ncommon good emerged in Chinese thought soon after it encountered the\nidea of rights from the West in the nineteenth century. For example,\nit was argued that individuals ought to have a range of freedom of\nexpression and action so that they can contribute more richly and\noriginally to the welfare of Chinese society. Chinese thinkers such as\nLiang Qichao and Japanese thinkers such as Kato affirmed both the\nlegitimacy of the individual’s desires and the necessity to\nharmonize individual and group desires (see Angle and Svensson, 2001;\nAngle, 2002). Emphasis on the former would be the relatively new\nelement in a contemporary Confucianism, but 1B6 of the\nMencius provides a striking anticipation of this element.\nHere King Xuan tells Mencius that his ability to be a true king for\nhis people is thwarted by his desires for wealth and for sex. Mencius\nreplies that if the King accords the common people the same privileges\nfor wealth and sex, there would be no problem in becoming a true king.\nXunzi (see section 2.6) conceives of morality as a way of harmonizing\nthe desires of individuals so that destructive conflict is replaced by\nproductive harmony, and this gives the satisfaction of desire a\ncentral role in his version of Confucian ethics. Later on in the\ntradition, Dai Zhen defended the legitimacy of self-interested desire\nas long as it is tempered by a proper concern for others (see Tiwald,\n2011a; and section 2.8). Rosemont (1991, 2004) has argued that\n“second-generation”“positive” rights to\neducation and economic security are better grounded in the Chinese\ntradition than they have been in the West. Such grounding might have\nvery deep roots in Confucian thought, specifically what Chan calls the\n“service” conception of government, or the idea that\ngovernment finds its only warrant in protecting and advancing the\nwelfare of the people. \nThe above arguments on behalf of recognizing rights within a Confucian\nframework provide resources for addressing the worry that rights\nundermine social harmony. Achieving harmony is a continuous process of\nadjusting to inevitable differences even among reasonable individuals.\nProviding a forum for the airing of differences can positively\ncontribute to a better and more inclusive view of the common good.\nRights need not be justified in a way that opposes them to the common\ngood but can in fact be construed as necessary for its realization.\nThis might present a somewhat different conception of rights that does\nnot treat them as “trumps” but as based on substantial\nmoral considerations that must be taken into account but do not\nnecessarily override all other moral considerations. \nIt might be argued that however much Confucianism evolves, it would be\ndifficult to conceive of it without the idea that the wisest, most\nvirtuous and competent should rule. Meritocracy is not in outright\ncontradiction with popular sovereignty. One might hold that people\nshould vote for those best equipped to promote the common good, for\nexample, and one might further argue that in contemporary\ncircumstances, Confucians have other reasons to take on board\ndemocratic institutions of citizen participation. Inspiration for the\nidea of combining legitimacy founded on popular election and\nlegitimacy founded on merit originally came from a proposal by the\ninfluential contemporary Confucian Jiang Qing (2012). However, his\nproposal includes a third legislative chamber consisting of those\nrepresenting the cultural and religious heritage of China, which most\nothers have not included.  \nJoseph Chan (2014) has argued that Confucianism may do well to\nincorporate democratic electoral institutions to hold political\nleaders accountable to the common good. Accordingly, he proposes that\nthere should be a democratically elected legislative chamber in a\nConfucian moderately perfectionist government. However, as democratic\ninstitutions are known not to necessarily result in the selection of\nthe wisest, most virtuous and competent, Chan proposes a second\nlegislative chamber to be paired with the first, the members of this\nsecond being chosen on the basis of demonstrated merit, in terms of\nvirtue and competence, as chosen by those who have had the opportunity\nto observe them in action, such as colleagues and experienced\njournalists. Chan’s overriding Confucian concern is moral\neducation throughout the whole society in virtues such as respect,\nreverence, trustworthiness, sincerity, beneficence, civility, and the\ncommon good. In fact, the primary function of the second chamber, in\nhis view, is to advance this educative goal. \nDaniel Bell (2006) and Tongdong Bai (2013, 2015) have proposed that\none legislative chamber be comprised of elected representatives and\nthe other by those selected on the basis of exams and previous\nperformance in office. Bell and Bai are more pessimistic than Chan is\nabout the prospects for modern democratic citizenry to make good\nchoices. Bai points out that the ancient Greeks had slaves that made\nit possible for them to fully participate in the Assembly, and they\nbelonged to a small city state, not a large society with many complex\nissues that require specialized knowledge to handle, and not one that\ngives rise to enormous inequalities that undermine the sense of a\ncommon good. Bell (2015) points out the negligible impact of any\nindividual’s vote in large democracies, and the time and effort\nrequired to become better informed about complex issues requiring\nspecialized knowledge. Even if individuals had the time and motivation\nto to be more informed, they are subject to a wide array of cognitive\nbiases that they are liable to get little help in correcting.  \nIn later work Bell (2015) proposes a “vertical” model in\nwhich democratic elections are instituted at the local level but the\ntop national leaders are selected on the basis of merit. at the\nintermediate levels, experimentation with democracy can take place,\nand if successful can be tried in other places or on an expanded\nbasis. He let go of the bicameral proposal because he became convinced\nthat the democratically elected chamber would eventually dominate.\nBell argues that democracy works best at the local level where voters\nare more likely to know the virtue and ability of the leaders they\nselect. The issues are relatively straightforward and easier to\nunderstand. It is easier to generate a sense of community at that\nlevel. At the highest levels of government, the issues are much more\ncomplex. Bell is well aware of problems for realizing the ideal of\nvirtuous and able leaders. There is corruption and ossification of an\nelite who are likely to come from and select colleagues from a narrow\nset of social, economic and educational backgrounds. Even if these\nproblems could be addressed through institutional reform, there is in\nthe end a need to legitimize conferring so much power and prestige on\nan elite who might not be that different from others in society who\nchoose different vocations. Bell concludes that democracy (perhaps in\nthe form of a popular referendum on the vertical model) might be\nnecessary for the legitimacy of a political meritocracy, even in a\ncountry with a Confucian heritage such as China.  \nOne common characteristic of the contemporary writing on Confucianism,\nrights and democracy is its relative openness to alternatives. There\nis less of a tendency to assume that a single model of government is\nright for all societies, even all large contemporary societies, or\neven all large, developed countries. At the same time, there is\nopenness to learning from the experience of other societies. There is\nmore awareness of the continuing nature of the debate and the\ninconclusiveness of history’s verdict thus far. \nThe Mohists constituted a philosophical school founded by Mozi, who\nwas roughly contemporaneous with Confucius. Not much is known about\nhim, but a reasonable speculation is that Mozi came from an artisan\nbackground. The text bearing his name contains purported quotations\nfrom Mozi, but it is manifestly the contribution of different persons\nover a substantial period of time. The text advocates a\nconsequentialist ethic that requires concern and acting for the\nbenefit of all, where the kind of benefit of greatest concern involves\nmaterial goods to satisfy the basic needs of all (e.g., enough food,\nshelter and warm clothing), sufficient population, and social order.\nThe Mozi’s conception of benefit is very concrete and\nrelatively narrow compared to forms of consequentialism that were to\nbecome dominant in the West (though the Mohist conception of order\nmay, as will be discussed later, include the relational virtues such\nas filiality). Arguably, Mohists were justified in setting their\npriorities on the most urgent needs. \nThe Mozi is quite explicit in its consequentialism. Chapter\n35 names three fa or standards for judging the viability of\nbeliefs and theories. One standard is of usefulness. In applying this\nstandard, one assesses the viability of a belief or theory according\nto the beneficial or harmful consequences of acting on it. Another\nstandard is that of consulting the origin, which is the historical\nrecord on the actions of the sage-kings. One determines whether the\nbelief or theory being judged accords with those actions. The third\nstandard is looking at evidence provided by the eyes and ears of the\npeople. This seems to refer to observations that garner some degree of\nintersubjective consensus. Each standard is presented as if its\nvalidity might be independent from the others, but there are\nindications that the standard of usefulness is the most basic one. For\none thing, consulting the record of the sage-kings’ actions\nhardly seems to be a good idea in Mohist terms given the Mohist\nobjection to valuing tradition for its own sake, unless these\nactions are good guides because they produced good results, a\nhistorical judgment that was commonly accepted by otherwise disputing\nphilosophical schools. Furthermore, arguments given in the\nMozi that are purportedly based on intersubjective\nobservation seem extremely dubious, e.g., that ghosts exist because\nstories are told about them very often. At one point in chapter 31, in\nfact, the possibility that ghosts do not exist is explicitly admitted,\nbut sacrifices to spirits are justified on the grounds that they\nproduce good effects among the living. Ghosts in general are put to\ngood use in the text: their primary activity is to avenge themselves\nupon the living persons who have done them wrong. The standard of\nusefulness guides application of the other standards. Even what seems\nto be the attempted justification of the standard of usefulness by\nreference to the will of tian or Heaven (in chapter 26) has a\ncircularity to it. We are to promote benefits and avoid harms because\nthat is the will of Heaven, and Heaven’s will is to be relied\nupon because it is the wisest and noblest of all agents. But what\ncould be the criterion for a being’s being wise and noble\nexception the promotion of benefits and avoidance of harms?\nFurthermore, the will of Heaven is demonstrated by the fact that\nwrongdoers are punished and the virtuous rewarded. Again, the evidence\nseems highly selective and is guided by the very standard of\nusefulness that it is seeemingly being justified. \nA crucial issue in the interpretation of Mohism is what kind of\nconcern for all it requires. As indicated earlier, Mencius interpreted\nthe Mohist advocacy of jian ai to be advocacy of equal or\nimpartial care for all, but some of the more important contemporary\nscholarship of Mohism has problematized this interpretation. Three\nchapters in the Mozi text (14,15, and 16) all bear the title\nof “Jian Ai.” These chapters differ somewhat in\ncontent, perhaps suggesting an evolution in Mohist thought over time\ncorresponding to the order of the chapters (see Defoort, 2005-6).\nPeople who do nothing to benefit others if they are not related to\nthem in the right way, or even harm them, are contrasted with those\nwho act according to jian ai. In the later two chapters, we\nare told to care for others as we care for ourselves, to view others\nas we view ourselves, or to be for others as we are for ourselves.\nSuch formulations might reasonably be taken to require equality or\nimpartiality of care. Perhaps this is why Mencius interpreted Mozi as\nrequiring denial of one’s parents (Mencius 3B9). \nHowever, the jian ai chapters consistently count among the\nfailures to care for others failures of filiality between fathers and\nsons. They correspondingly count among the benefits of acting\naccording to jian ai the realization of relational virtues\nsuch as filiality. Furthermore, the words used to say that we are to\ncare for others “as” we care for ourselves, to view others\n“as” we view ourselves, and to be for others\n“as” we are for ourselves, are ruo and\nyou, which can be used to mean equality of relationship or\nmerely similarity of relationship (see Chiu 2013; Fraser 2016). Chiu\n(2013) concludes that jian ai means only caring for everyone\nwith no requirement in equality of care. Fraser (2016), on the other\nhand, points to passages in later chapters of the Mozi (in\nthe section called the “Mo Bian” or “Mohist\nDialectics;” see Fraser, 2016: 171) that support the equal or\nimpartial caring interpretation.  \nFurther complicating the situation is the necessity to distinguish\njian ai as a prescription for the attitude to take toward\nothers and a prescription for conduct toward them. To have equal care\nas an attitude does not entail acting toward others in the same way.\nIndeed, the limited nature of the mental and physical resources\navailable to the individual agent seems to necessitate some degree of\ninequality of action toward others. This may be at least partly why\nthe jian ai chapters are relatively modest in their\nprescriptions for how individuals are to benefit others, even though\nthere is some expansion of requirement in the later chapters. In fact\neven the latter prescriptions do not seem incompatible with what might\nbe prescribed in the way of conduct by Confucian care with\ndistinctions: refraining from harming others, engaging in\nrelationships of mutual aid, and contributing to the support of those\nleast able to care for themselves and who lack families able to\nprotect them. Thus the Mohists may eventually have come to the view\nthat a division of moral labor is suitable for most people. Most can\nsatisfy the duties of righteousness (yi) through refraining\nfrom harming others, devoting more of their resources to benefiting\nthose in traditional relationships with them such as family, engaging\nin mutual aid in somewhat larger groups such as the village, being\nprepared to contribute along with others to the support and protection\nof the most needy, and being loyal to those charged with seeing to the\nbenefit of much larger groups. This picture fits with Mozi’s\nexpress concern (in chapter 8 on honoring the worthy) that social\nconflict comes from each person having and acting on their own\nconception of what is right. To avoid conflict a strict nested\nhierarchy of authority must be instituted: the Son of Heaven rules\nover the entire country with the help of ministers, and the country is\ndivided into states, which are further divided into fiefdoms, and so\non. Each social unit has its superior whose word on what is right is\nfinal to subordinates (though one may remonstrate with a superior if\none believes them wrong), and each unit must report to the superior of\nthe next larger unit containing it. The Son of Heaven is accountable\nto Heaven, Tian, a more clearly and consistently\nanthropomorphized deity than the Confucian Tian, and whose\nwill is that people benefit and not harm one another. \nHonoring the relational virtues of family may be justified on the\ngrounds that it is part of a social division of labor that most\nefficiently contributes to the benefit of all. It may also be, as\nFraser (2016: 146) has suggested, that the Mohist conception of\nbenefit (li) includes the realization of such virtues as\ngoods in themselves. On either construal or both, since the possible\njustifications are not inconsistent with another, Mohists may not have\nadvocated as demanding an ethic as may appear from the text’s\nstatements of what jian ai is. Even if one interprets the\nattitudinal component as requiring equal or impartial care, the\nconduct component might consist of only a moderately demanding norms\nfor benefiting others. \nHeaven is treated as a kind of model for human beings. In one of the\nchapters on Heaven’s will, Mozi is quoted as saying that he\ntreats the will of Heaven as a wheelwright holds to his compass and a\ncarpenter his square. That Heaven is taken as a direct model in this\nway is significant for the question of whether jian ai taken\nin its attitudinal component means equal concern or merely concern\nthat can vary in degree. Heaven’s will is not known through\nrevelation or scripture but rather in how it acts. According to the\ntext, it benefits and nourishes everyone; it rewards those who aid\nothers and punishes those who harm others. It provides life and\nsustenance to rich and poor, noble and low, kin and nonkin; it created\nthe regular and constant pattern of the seasons and weather that makes\nall these broadly distributed benefits possible. If Heaven’s\nwill is taken as a model for the attitude one should have toward\nothers, then impartiality of attitude seems to be the\nprescription. \nHeaven also can serve as a model for conduct, such that one might not\nonly benefit all in the sense of conforming to norms that would\ngenerally benefit everyone if enough people do their part, but also\ndirectly try to benefit as many people as possible, especially if one\nis in a position of means and influence. In the 16th chapter, King Wen\nis extolled as having exemplified the practice of jian ai.\nHis practice was like the illumination of the sun and the moon,\nshowing no favoritism to any direction or region. King Wen here\nexemplifies what can be a more demanding virtue than righteousness,\nwhich is benevolence (in the Mohist text this probably the best\ntranslation of ren). Fraser points out that in some of the\nlater chapters of the Mozi that feature dialogues between\nMozi and others, an ideal of sagehood emerges that is much more\ndemanding than the prescriptions issued for everyone in the jian\nai chapters. In chapter 49, righteousness is characterized as\nlying largely in helping others (Fraser 2016: 150). More radically,\nchapter 47 quotes Mozi as advocating the elimination of happiness,\nanger, joy, sorrow, likes and dislikes and dedicating oneself solely\nto benevolence and righteousness. Thus there might have been an\nevolution towards this more demanding ideal late in the Mohist\nmovement, but perhaps, as Fraser (2016: 151) suggests, this ideal was\ntreated as applicable only to the most devoted of Mohists. \nThis greater complexity associated with what it means to care for all\nmight be a feature of any consequentialist ethic that takes seriously\nthe idea of equal or impartial concern. Even if care as an attitude\ndoes not necessarily require trying to directly promote the benefit of\nall, the more capacity one has to promote the welfare of large numbers\nof people, the more one may (or should) feel bound to do so. Even if\none acknowledges relationships such as those one finds in good\nfamilies to have value in themselves, one might also be moved by the\nrecognition that these things are valuable to everyone. One might come\nto feel bound by the acknowledgment that one would be doing the most\ngood by helping the greater number to fulfill their basic needs and to\nachieve those relationships, even if this drains the mental and\nphysical resources one has to put into one’s own\nrelationships. \nIt is perhaps no accident that similar ambiguities are displayed in\nWestern forms of consequentialism. There are very demanding forms of\nconsequentialism, exemplified by Peter Singer’s argument for\nstrong duties to contribute to famine relief (Singer, 1972). These\nforms typically focus on the good an individual could do on their own,\nregardless of whether others act similarly. When combined with the\nidea that others are no less morally important than oneself, these\nforms tend to justify very strong duties on the part of those with\nrelatively plentiful resources to aid others. On the other hand, there\nare forms of consequentialism that construe the individual’s\nduties in terms of a generally applicable set of norms, the\ndesirability of which is determined by the consequences of everyone or\nnearly everyone accepting them. Such forms of consequentialism, (e.g.,\nfor rule consequentialism, see Hooker 2000), tend to confirm more\nmodest demands on the individual to aid others. Consequentialism may\ntend to oscillate between the pole of doing’s best in directly\nacting on equal concern for all others on the one hand and on the\nother hand acknowledging both practical and psychological limitations\non the ability of (at least) most people to do so. \nHow, then, does Mohist ethics differ from Confucian ethics in the end?\nBecause Confucian care with distinctions requires the extension of\ncare to nonkin, and because Mohists by and large prescribed a modestly\ndemanding form of jian ai as applied to conduct toward\nothers, there is not as dramatic a practical difference as one might\nfirst think between Confucian and Mohist ethics. Confucians accept\nthat there are plural sources of moral duty, and that conflicts\nbetween the reasons provided by these sources must be dealt with\nthrough the discretion and weighing of judgment. While Mohists appear\nto put forward a monistic source of duty—promoting benefits and\navoiding harms, a plausible reading of the Mozi has it including\nplural sources of benefit, e.g., food and filiality. They may also\nhave to resort to discretion and weighing of judgment when there are\nconflicts between plural goods. Mohists might attach more weight to\nthe value of doing good for the most people when it comes into\nconflict with loyalty to kin, but there is no explicit position on\nthis question in the Mozi.  \nThere are certainly differences between the two ethics on the value of\nritual and musical performance. Of course, many Confucians might be\nunhappy with the Mohist portrayal of their tradition as insisting on\nextravagantly expensive performances. But the difference over the\nvalue of ritual and music has even deeper roots than the issue of how\nmuch of a society’s material resources should be expended to\nstage them. Confucians tend to view the moral life as not only service\nto others but as fulfilling one’s own humanity. This feature of\nConfucian ethics, which it shares with classical Greek virtue ethics,\ndistances it from Mohism. \nFurthermore, as pointed out earlier, the Confucian conception of a\nhumanly fulfilling way of life has aesthetic and emotionally\nexpressive dimensions that set it further apart from Mohism. The focus\non ritual and music exemplifies a deep concern for graceful and\nskillful enactments of concern and respect for others. To express\nthese attitudes in a fitting and beautiful way is intrinsically\nvaluable. The practice of ritual and music is also conceived as\ncrucial for cultivation of one’s desires and emotional\ndispositions. For Confucius and Xunzi, such practice constituted\ntraining of one’s desires and emotional dispositions, ways of\nrestraining a stubborn and undue concern for the self. While Mencius\ndoes not emphasize such a function for the practice of ritual and\nmusic, he does conceive of moral cultivation as nurturing the inborn\nemotional sensibilities that find fulfillment in relationship to\nothers. He recognizes the danger of overfeeding the small part of the\nself that takes pleasure in eating and drinking. This need to shape\nand train the self stands in contrast with the aforementioned Mohist\nassumption that the main cause of social conflict is the variety of\ndifferent conceptions of what is right that individuals tend to have.\nThere is no indication in this Mohist diagnosis that there is any\nspecial difficulty in getting oneself or others to try to do what one\nthinks is right.  \nIn the Daodejing (the text is associated with Laozi and is\nthought to have originated sometime in the period of\n6th-3rd century B.C.E.) and Zhuangzi (a\ntext associated with the historical Zhuangzi who lived in the\n4th century B.C.E.) the focus shifts from the human social\nworld to the cosmos, in which that human world often appears to be\ntiny and insignificant or even comically and absurdly self-important.\nIt may seem that such a distanced and detached perspective has no\nethical content or implications, but that is to assume an overly\nnarrow vision of the ethical. In its own way, Daoism addresses as much\nas Confucianism does questions as to how one ought to live one’s\nlife. Daoist ethics emphasizes appropriate responsiveness to the\nbroader world that shapes and enfolds the human social world. \nThe nature of the vision of the broader world is open to dispute. A\ntraditional interpretation of the Daodejing is that it\nconveys a metaphysical vision of the dao as the source of all\nthings, and that this source is specially associated in nonbeing and\nemptiness as contrasted with being, perhaps suggesting that the\ndao is an indeterminate ontological ground in which the\nmyriad individual things are incipient. Some contemporary commentators\nhold that the traditional interpretation is an imposition on the text\nof later metaphysical concerns (Hansen, 1992; LaFargue, 1992). Others\nhew closer to the traditional interpretation, citing passages such as\nthose in chapter 4, where Dao is described as being empty, as seeming\nsomething like the ancestor of the myriad of things, as appearing to\nprecede the Lord (di). \nHowever that issue is resolved, it is apparent that a certain\nconception of the patterns of nature is embedded in the text and\ninforms its ethical recommendations. Consider the characterizations of\nnatural processes as falling into one or another of opposites: there\nis the active, aggressive, hard, and the male, on the one hand; and\nthere is the passive, yielding, soft, and female, on the other hand\n(later these forces were much more explicitly associated with\nyang and yin). Conventional “knowledge”\nand “wisdom” dichotomizes processes into one or another of\nthese categories and values the first over the second. The\nDaodejing extols the efficacy of the second. Whereas the\nfirst is associated with strength, the second, it is often said,\npossesses a deeper, underlying strength as demonstrated by water\novercoming the hard and unyielding (chapter 78). Hence a\n“soft” style of action, wu wei (literally,\n“nonaction” but less misleadingly translated as effortless\naction) is recommended, even as a style of ruling. For example,\nchapter 66 says that one who desires to rule must in his words humble\nhimself before the people, and that one who desires to lead the people\nmust in his person follow them. Chapter 75 says that rulers eat up too\nmuch in taxes and therefore people are hungry. Rulers are too fond of\naction and therefore the people are difficult to govern. Setting too\nmuch store on life makes people treat death lightly. The last point\nbrings out the related theme that striving after something often\nproduces the opposite of the intended result. One of the more\nprominent themes in the Daodejing is the rejection of\nmoralism: a preoccupation with and striving to become good or\nvirtuous. Chapter 19 says to exterminate ren and discard\nyi (righteousness or rectitude), and the people will recover\nfilial love. \nOne crucial ambiguity of the text is whether the “soft”\nwu wei style of action is meant consistently to be extolled\nover the “hard” style (as Lau claims in his introduction\nto his translation of the Daodejing, 1963), or whether the\nreversal of valuation is merely a heuristic device meant to correct a\ncommon human tendency to err in the direction of consistently valuing\nthe hard style (LaFargue, 1992). The second alternative is consistent\nwith a theme plausibly attributed to the text: that all dichotomies\nand all valuations based on them are unreliable in the end, even\nevaluations that are reversals of the conventionally accepted ones.\nPrescriptions to follow the “soft” style, taken as\nexceptionless generalizations, are no more reliable than the\nconventional wisdom to follow the “hard” style. On the\nother hand, many of the prescriptions in the Daodejing seem\npremised on the conception of there being genuine human needs that are\nsimple and few in number, and that desires going beyond these needs\nare the source of trouble and conflict. Prescriptions for the ruler\nseem to be aimed at bringing about a reversion to a kind of\nprimitivist state of society where no “improvements” are\nsought or desired. Carried to its logical limit, this primitivism\nimplies the existence of a natural goodness with which human beings\nought to become attuned. Indeed, the first of the three treasures of\nchapter 67 is ci or compassion. The ethics of the\nDaodejing is in these respects less radical and iconoclastic\nthan some of its anti-moralistic language might suggest. If we are not\nto strive after goodness, it is there nevertheless as something that\nwe must recover. \nOn this point the Zhuangzi often sounds a much more skeptical\nnote. In the second (“Equalizing All Things”) chapter of\nthat text, the following questions go unanswered: “How do I know\nthat to take pleasure in life is not a delusion? How do I know that we\nwho hate death are not exiles since childhood who have forgotten the\nway home?” (translation from Graham, 1989, 59; see also the\ntranslation from Ziporyn, 2009). The human pretension to know what is\ntrue and important is lampooned by comparing it to the pretension of\nthe cicada and turtle dove to know by their own experiences of flight\nthe possibilities of how high creatures can fly. There is no vision of\na primitivist utopia here either. Rather, the dominant attitude\ntowards the possibility of large-scale social change for the better is\npessimism. It is a dangerous task for the idealist to undertake, and\none that will probably end badly for the idealist because rulers\ndon’t like to be lectured on their failings. On this matter, the\nZhuangzi not only diverges from the primitivist Utopian\nstrain in the Daodejing but also more forcefully from the\nearnest and ever-striving idealism of the Confucians. In the\nfourth(“The Human World”) chapter, a pessimistic Confucius\n(who here seems to be speaking on behalf of Zhuangzi) tells his\nidealistic student Yan Hui that he will probably get himself killed\ntrying to change the ways of a callous and violent ruler. Further,\nsome passages in this story can be read as implying that Yan\nHui’s deeper motivation is to gain praise for his own virtue.\nThat Yan Hui might be characterized in this way is especially\nsignificant, because the Confucian tradition regards his motivations\nas being especially pure. The implication might be that the Confucian\nidealistic project is continually and inevitably self-undermining:\npeople can sense the self-aggrandizing motivations behind the noble\ntalk and react negatively (see Chong, 2016).  \nAt the same time, it is significant that in this story Confucius does\nnot reject Yan Hui’s idealistic project altogether, but suggests\nanother way of proceeding. If he insists on trying, Yan Hui must\nrefrain from formulating plans and goals. Such preconceptions will\nonly interfere with seeing the ruler as he is and how he must be dealt\nwith (there is a grain, then, unique to each human being to which one\nmust become attuned to deal with him or her). So Yan Hui must prepare\nnot with plans but by fasting and emptying his mind. Elsewhere in the\ntext, there are happier references to activities that involve\nattunement to the grain of whatever is at hand. These forms of\nactivity are presented as supremely satisfying. The most prominent\nexample is that of Cook Ding, the cook who is able to wield his knife\nso skillfully in cutting up oxen that it flows without a nick through\nthe spaces within the joints. Cook Ding has gotten past the stage\nwhere he sees with his eyes while cutting the ox; instead his\nqi or vital energies move freely to where they must go. The\nkind of phenomenology to which the Zhuangzi refers is one in\nwhich there is no self-conscious guiding of one’s actions but\nrather a complete absorption with the matter of hand. The efficacy and\neffortlessness of such activities might appear to suggest privileged\nveridical access to the situation and material at hand. \nComplete absorption in the matter at hand seems to involve the ability\nto keep one’s desires from interfering with one’s\nattention. The Daodejing contains epigrams about the\ndesirability of being desireless, but chapter 1 of the\nZhuangzi includes an entertaining story that conveys this\nlesson. Huizi tries to figure out what to do with the shells of some\nhuge gourds he had grown. He tried using them as water dippers and\nwater containers, but they are too large and heavy for those purposes.\nNot being able to discover a purpose for them, he smashes them to\npieces. Zhuangzi chides his friend for having underbrush in his head\nand not realizing that he could have lashed the gourds together to\nmake a raft for floating about on the lakes and the rivers. A\nrecurrent theme throughout the first chapter is that we are ruled by\nour preconceptions of the uses of things, which keeps us from being\nable to recognize the usefulness of the “useless.” When\nperforming skill activities such as Cook Ding’s, preoccupation\nwith the “uses” of these activities can interfere with our\nability to perform them well. Woodcarver Qing (chapter 19 of the\nZhuangzi) makes marvelous bellstands. When he goes to make\none, he fasts in order to still his mind. As he fasts, the distracting\nthoughts of congratulation and reward melt away, honors and salary,\nblame and praise, skill and clumsiness, even his awareness of having a\nbody and limbs. Only when he is able to focus does he go into the\nforest to observe the nature of the wood, and only then does he have a\ncomplete vision of the bellstand. \nInterpretations of the Zhuangzi tend to give primacy either\nto the skeptical passages or to the passages suggesting special access\nto the grain of things. On the first option, Zhuangzi simply\nappreciates the many perspectives on the world one could have, the\nmany ways of dividing the world up by sets of distinctions, none of\nwhich can be shown in a non-question-begging manner to be superior to\nthe others (Hansen, 1992, 2003; see also Chong, 2016). On the second\noption, Zhuangzi is often taken to hold in a kind of ineffable and\nnonconceptual access to the world, an access that makes possible the\nefficacy of activities such as Cook Ding’s (Ivanhoe, 1996; Roth\n1999, 2000). A third possibility is that the text demonstrates a kind\nof continuing dialectic between skepticism and the conviction that one\nhas genuine knowledge, and that the dialectic has no envisioned end.\nThe dialectic includes a stage of skeptical questioning of whatever\none’s current beliefs are, but the aim is not merely to\nundermine but to reveal something about the way the world that is\noccluded by one’s current beliefs. However, one is not allowed\nto rest content with the new beliefs but is led to question their\ncomprehensiveness and adequacy precisely because they are suspected of\noccluding still something else about the world (Wong, 2005). \nHowever one might try to reconcile the tension between the skeptical\nquestioning and the claims to special knowledge, the stories about\nskill activities such as Cook Ding’s arguably exemplify certain\nkinds of activities that human beings across cultures and historical\nperiods have experienced to their great satisfaction. These activities\ninvolve the mastery of the many sub-activities that constitute a\ncomplex activity with goals that challenge abilities of the agent. The\nactivities of master musicians (e.g., the technique of fingering on a\nflute), artistic performers (e.g., the placement of the toes in the\npirouette of a dancer) and athletes (e.g., bringing the bat through\nthe optimal plane while swinging it to hit a baseball) correspond\nrather closely to Cook Ding’s mastery of the sub-activities of\ncutting through the ox. In all these activities the agent does not\nneed to pay conscious attention to performance of the sub-activities,\nand this enables attention to be focused on matters that escape the\napprentice. Just as Cook Ding’s skill in the motor execution of\nthe motions of cutting allows him to fully focus on where the joints\nand spaces are, the flutist is able to concentrate on the music as she\nis making it and not her fingering technique (see Csikszentmihalyi,\n1990 for a study of such activities). \nOne interesting and realistic detail in the cook’s story\nchallenges the reading of the skill stories as extolling the\npossibility of nonconceptual access to the grain of things. The cook\nsays that whenever he comes to a complicated place in the ox, he sizes\nup the difficulties, tell himself to watch out and be careful, keeps\nhis eyes on what he’s doing, works very slowly, and moves the\nknife with the greatest subtlety until the pieces fall away. Clearly\nthere is conceptualization going on here, and in fact it is\nimplausible to deny that the whole activity is being guided by a\nconceptualized goal! There is a difference between self-conscious\nconceptualization of experience and the application of concepts\nwithout awareness of applying them. One mustn’t confuse the\nlatter with nonconceptualized experience. While there may be some way\nof squaring this part of the story with the interpretation that\nnonconceptual experience is celebrated in the Zhuangzi, the\nvirtue of the story is that it is realistic and captures aspects of\nsupremely skilled activities that are part of the experience of many\npeople. Insofar as the Zhuangzi recommends such activities as\npart of a good life, it very much presents an ethic. \nIt also presents an ethic in supporting the idea of inclusiveness and\nacceptance. Here skeptical questioning of what we think we know,\nespecially what we think we know about people and who is good and has\nsomething to offer to us are questioned in the chapter featuring\nstigmatized individuals, often with feet amputated (a common criminal\npunishment of the time), who turn out to be masters drawing as many\nstudents as Confucius. The Zhuangzi also urges identification\nand acceptance of the whole and of any and all of the changes that its\ncreatures undergo. We should not be so sure that life is great and\ndeath is evil, and accept everything that comes our way, marveling at\nthe possibility that upon our death we might be made into a\nfly’s foreleg the next time around. The Zhuangzi, like\nthe Daodejing, calls upon human beings to identify with the\nwhole of the cosmos and its transformations, and such identification\ninvolves acceptance, even celebration of death and loss, because in\ndying one participates in the next transformation of the cosmos and\nbecomes something else to marvel at, such as a fly’s foreleg.\nSuch a call may hold deep appeal, especially for those who cannot see\nany form of monotheism as a viable object for belief and yet desire\nsome sort of spiritual connection that stretches beyond the merely\nhuman community. \nHowever, such a call also raises challenging questions about human\npossibility. Can human beings really accept the loss of their selves\nand their loved ones with the kind of equanimity that identification\nwith the whole requires? The Zhuangzi presents stories that\nrepresent different possibilities for conceiving of the nature of this\nequanimity. In the stories of the four masters, death is accepted\nwithout the slightest shiver. In the story of the death of\nZhuangzi’s wife, a more complex emotional story is told, whereby\nZhuangzi first feels her loss but comes to accept it as yet another\ntransformation. This story suggests that one may retain one’s\nattachments to particular people and yet maintain resilience in the\nface of their loss because of one’s identification with the\nwhole (see Becker, 1998 for an discussion of resilience in the face of\nloss in the context of developing a contemporary Stoicism). But how is\nsuch identification psychologically possible? In the\nZhuangzi, it seems based on a spirit of restless and joyful\nexploration of the richness of the cosmos. In the end, it embodies the\nemotion that is perhaps most fundamental to philosophy, and that is\nwonder. \nThere is one more ethical implication of Daoism ethics that is more of\nan implication that could be drawn by contemporary philosophers than\none that was drawn in the foundational texts. The\nZhuangzi’s lampooning of human pretension and\narrogance, together with call to identify with the whole and with the\nnonhuman parts of nature, has appealed to those seeking philosophical\nperspectives within which to frame an environmental ethic (see\nGirardot, Miller, and Liu, 2001). A Daoist perspective offers both an\nalternative to an instrumentalist approach that would ground an\nenvironmental ethic solely in the idea that it defeats human\nbeings’ interests to foul their own environment and to an\nintrinsic value approach that would ground duties to nature solely in\na value that it possesses apart from its relation to human beings. A\nDaoist approach might point to the way that the human traits are\nconditioned by and responses to the nonhuman environment, such that\nthese traits cannot be specified independently of the environment. In\nother words the Daoist self is not a substantial independent existence\nbut a relational one whose boundaries extend into the conventionally\nnonhuman, and from a Daoist perspective that is reconstructed to be\noriented toward the problem of the environment, we would do well to\nacknowledge the ways in which whatever we value in ourselves is\nconnected to the nonhuman (Hourdequin and Wong, 2005; Hassoun and\nWong, 2015). Treating the environment correctly is not purely a matter\nof satisfying conventional human interests such as conserving\nresources for our future consumption, nor need it be a matter of\nrecognizing a value that the environment has in complete independence\nof its impact on us. It can be a matter of recognizing that who we are\ncannot be cleanly separated from the nonhuman environment. Moreover,\nthere is much to be gained from being open to the transformation of\nour interests if we remain open to new sources of satisfaction in the\nnonhuman environment that currently escape our conceptions of the\n“useful” (recall Huizi and the gourds). \nNone of this shows that the composers of the classical Daoist texts\nhad an environmental ethic. Goldin (2005) points out that\nChina does not have a very good history of concern for degradation or\noveruse of the environment and that the Daoist texts express no\nconcern about such matters. As Goldin points out, the Chinese ancients\nsimply had nothing comparable to our environmental problems. It is\npossible to find, however, fundamental attitudes toward the human\nrelationship with nature that in our own time might seem a more\npromising basis for an environmental ethic. These attitudes embody a\ndifferent relationship with nature that is not governed by the\nimperative of ceaseless consumption and the drive to colonize nature\n(see Jonathan Chan, 2009; and Miller, 2017 for further discussion of\nhow Daoism might provide resources for dealing with the contemporary\nenvironmental crisis). \nLegalism is perhaps best introduced as the opposite reaction to\nAnalects 2.3, in which Confucius says that guiding the people\nby edicts and keeping them in line with punishments will keep them out\nof trouble but will give them no sense of shame; guiding them by\nvirtue and keeping them in line with the rites will not only give them\na sense of shame but enable them to reform themselves. In the most\nprominent Legalist text, the Hanfeizi (Hanfei lived during\nthe 3rd century B.C.E.), the people are characterized as\nfar too swayed by their material interests to be guided by a sense of\nshame. People must be guided by clear edicts and strong punishments.\nFurthermore, rulers must be wary of their ambitious ministers and take\ncare not to reveal their own likes and dislikes so as not to be\nmanipulated by their scheming subordinates. As to rulers themselves,\nit is a mistake to found government on the presumption that they are\nor can become virtuous. While exceptionally good and exceptionally\nevil rulers have existed, the vast majority of rulers have been\nmediocre. Governments must be structured so that it can run\nsatisfactorily, because that is what rulers will be like almost\nalways. \nThe Confucians held that the remedy to China’s turmoil and chaos\nlay in wise and morally excellent rulers—that moral excellence\nwould ripple downwards from the top and create harmony and prosperity.\nThe Daodejing upholds a vision of an original harmony that\nhuman beings once had, a way that consisted in living in accord with\nthe natural grain of things, and that involves seeking only what one\ntruly needs, not in multiplying useless desires that only agitate and\nultimately make us unhappy. The Legalists rejected moral and spiritual\ntransformation, of either the Confucian or Laoist kind, as the\nsolution to China’s troubles. Most human beings will remain\nunlovely beings to the end, and governmental structures must be\ndesigned for such beings. The sort of structure recommended is a\nhighly centralized government in which the ruler retains firm control\nof the “two handles” of government: punishment and favor\n(chapter 7). By making sure he always has his own hands on these\nhandles, the ruler remains in firm control of his ministers. If a\nminister proposes a way to get something done, measure his performance\non whether he gets it done in the way he says he will. If not, punish\nhim. The ruler is to hold his officials strictly to the definitions of\ntheir role responsibilities, so that they are punished not only when\nthey fail to perform some of those assigned responsibilities but also\nwhen they do more than their assigned responsibilities. \nSome of the most interesting parts of the text consist of arguments\nsupporting the necessity of governmental structure and the folly of\ndepending on the character of rulers. It’s not just that virtue\nis a rare thing. Even if it appears in a ruler, it is not by itself\nsufficient for achieving a good society. The “Five Vermin”\nchapter (49) does not dispute an assumption that is commonly held\nacross Chinese philosophical schools—that the sage-kings of\nancient times were virtuous and ruled over a harmonious and prosperous\nsociety. It disputes, however, that their virtue was the primary cause\nof this golden age. What about those kings in more recent times who\nwere ren and yi, benevolent and righteous, and who\ngot wiped out for their trouble? Virtue by itself is not the\nexplanation of success or failure. The explanation has much more to do\nwith the scarcity of goods in relation to the number of people. It\nfurther has to do with whether the right sort of structure of roles\nwith attendant powers and privileges is put into place. This structure\ncan optimize the effectiveness of, and limit the damage done by,\npeople who are not especially virtuous or extraordinarily able.  \nConfucians can give replies to such arguments. In answer to the\nargument that virtue is too rare a thing to depend upon, the most\nobvious reply is that they never promised virtue would be easy.\nIndeed, the canonical texts all stress the difficulty of achieving\nfull virtue. Mencius in particular conceives of moral development as\nextending the natural beginnings of virtue to situations where they\nought to extend but do not currently extend. Confucians might also\nobject that good results will follow from the kind of structure\ndescribed in the Hanfeizi only if persons of good-enough\ncharacter staff it. The Hanfeizi sometimes implicitly\nacknowledges this point and integrates it with a reasonable stress on\nstructure and impersonal administration. In chapter six there is\ndiscussion of what is necessary to compensate for a mediocre ruler:\ngetting able people with the right motives to serve that ruler.\nInstitute laws and regulations specifying how these people are\nselected: not on the basis of reputation alone, since that will give\npeople an incentive to curry favor with their associates and\nsubordinates and disregard the ruler; not on the basis of cliques,\nsince that will motivate people only to establish connections rather\nthan acquire the qualifications to perform in office. Specify the\nqualifications clearly in laws and regulations, appoint, promote, and\ndismiss strictly according to these specifications. The law, not the\nruler’s personal views, must form the basis for these actions.\nIn chapter 43, consideration is given to the suggestion that those who\ntake heads in battle should be rewarded with desirable offices. This\nis rejected in cases where the office requires wisdom and ability\nrather than courage. In the end, one wonders whether a good number of\nsuch persons of right motive, competence, courage, wisdom and ability\nare enough, given the highly centralized nature of the government\nrecommended in the Hanfeizi. A lot depends on the ruler who\nwields the “two handles” of government. Taken in moderate\ndoses, Hanfeizi arguably provides a needed corrective to the\nConfucian emphasis on character. Structure can be designed with an eye\nto the realistic possibilities for mediocre and bad rulers. The\nConfucian emphasis on discretion in judgment is obviously subject to\nabuse that can be checked by structures that provide a degree of\nimpersonal administration and consistent application of relatively\nclear laws and regulations. The American legal experience seems to\nshow, however, that no set of laws can interpret itself with an eye to\ncomplex situations that are unforeseeable when laws are framed.\nUltimately, stable character and wise discretion are needed. \nThe strongest challenge that Legalism raises to virtue ethics is not\nthat stable virtues are impossible to achieve, but that they are not\nrealistic possibilities for most persons, and that therefore lofty\nvirtue ideals cannot provide the basis for a large-scale social ethic.\nEven if these ideals are directed only at an elite that is then\nexpected to lead the rest of the people, the question arises as to\nwhat influence this elite can have on the rest if the majority do not\nhave some attraction to virtue. It is dubious, however, that the\nsolution lies in seeking to make character irrelevant. \nBuddhism is not indigenous to China, and it has a long and rich\ntradition of thought and practice in India and in areas other than\nChina. This brief section will focus on ethical aspects of the most\ndistinctive form of Buddhism that developed once it was introduced to\nChina: Chan Buddhism, or as it came to be known later in Japan, Zen.\nIt should be noted, however, that prominent forms of Chinese Buddhism\nalso include Tiantai and Huayan. All three forms of Chinese Buddhism\ndeveloped in interaction with indigenous Chinese thought, especially\nDaoism. Chan developed partly as a response to the perception of some\nChinese Buddhists that Tiantai and Huayan had developed in overly\nscholastic directions with proliferating metaphysical distinctions and\ndoctrines that hinder rather than aid Enlightenment. \nThe immediate focus of Buddhist ethics is the problem of suffering,\nand a conception of the self is at the heart of the Buddhist response\nto that problem. The self is conceived as a floating collection of\nvarious psychophysical reactions and responses with no fixed center or\nunchanging ego entity. The usual human conception of self as a fixed\nand unchanging center is a delusion. Our bodily attributes, various\nfeelings, perceptions, ideas, wishes, dreams, and in general a\nconsciousness of the world display a constant interplay and\ninterconnection that leads us to the belief that there is some\ndefinite ‘I’ that underlies and is independent of the\never-shifting series. But there is only the interacting and\ninterconnected series. Human suffering ultimately stems from a concern\nfor the existence and pleasures and pains of the kind of self that\nnever existed in the first place. Recognition of the impermanence of\nthe self can lead to release or mitigation of suffering, but the\nrecognition cannot merely be intellectual. It must involve\ntransformation of one’s desires. The belief on some abstract\nlevel, for example, that there are no permanent selves is a belief\nthat can co-exist with having and acting on intense desires to avoid\ndeath, as if death were some evil befalling some underlying\n‘I’. Similarly, the intellectual recognition that none of\nthe “things” of ordinary life are fixed and separate\nentities, anymore than the self is, can lead to recognition of all of\nlife as an interdependent whole and to the practical attitude of\ncompassion for all of life. But if the latter recognition is again\nmerely intellectual, one can still have and act on intensely\nself-regarding desires at severe cost to others. In both cases a\ntransformation of desire is what is required in order to go beyond the\nmerely intellectual and to achieve true Enlightenment and meaningful\nrecognition of one’s true nature as impermanent and as\ninterdependent with all other things. \nRecall the practical focus and the closeness to pre-theoretical\nexperience that are distinctive of indigenous Chinese philosophy.\nThese traits interacted with Buddhism as it was introduced into China.\nThe ‘Chan’ in “Chan Buddhism” comes from the\nSanskrit ‘dhyana’ which means meditation. Though\nmeditation practice is not the only practice employed in Chan, its\ncentral role does illustrate the focus on achieving transformation of\none’s desires through experience of the self and the world. This\nkind of transformation is different than reaching intellectual\nconviction through textual study and understanding of argumentation,\nand also different than escape from the world of suffering through\nobliteration of one’s consciousness as an individual being.\nChinese Buddhism in the form of Chan was especially influential in\nputting forward this conception of Enlightenment as lived in this\nworld rather than escaping from it. \nDaoism in particular has themes that make it especially appropriate\nfor interaction with Buddhism. Recall the theme that one must keep\ndesires from interfering with one’s attention to the matter at\nhand. Correspondingly, a major theme in Chan is that all forms of\nstriving, especially the very striving for Enlightenment, interfere\nwith attention to one’s true nature (Hui Neng, 638–713,\nPlatform Scripture). Hence the reason for the otherwise\npuzzlingly harsh reactions of Chan masters to the earnest strivings of\ntheir students to reach Enlightenment (Yi Xuan, d. 866, The\nRecorded Conversations of Linji Yi Xuan) especially if such\nstrivings have any tinge of the academic or doctrinal about them\n(Huang Po, d. 850, The Transmission of Mind). Recall also the\ntheme in Daodejing concerning the dao as the source\nof the myriad things. The Buddha’s insight into the nature of\nthe many things brought him to recognize the Many as also the One.\nFinally, recall the skeptical theme in Daoism about the limits of\nconceptualization. The Buddha’s insight into the Many as also\nthe One does not mean that the Many are really only One, but rather\nMany and Once at once, and if we have difficulty making sense of that,\nit is founded in the limits of our conceptualization. Finally, there\nis the same possibility for ambiguity as to whether there is some\nineffable and nonconceptual access to an ultimate reality or whether\nthere is skeptical question that goes all the way down (or all the way\nup?). In the Zhuangzi this ambiguity is quite apparent. And\nthough Chan is usually taken to affirm a foundation in ineffable\naccess (Kasulis, 1986), there are those who argue that a thoroughgoing\nskepticism is truer to its spirit (Wright, 1998). \nSince the self is a bundle of changing psychological and physical\nattributes whose boundaries are conventionally established, and since\nits attributes exist only in relation to other things outside its\nconventionally established boundaries, it ought to dampen its\nself-regarding cares and concerns and widen the boundaries of its\nconcerns to embrace all life. This Buddhist reasoning certainly is an\ninteresting way to ground impersonal concern, and it may appeal to\nthose of us who see little plausibility in the idea of Cartesian\nsubstances as fixed ego entities. On the other hand, this reasoning\nmay seem to drain all passion from life, and it requires that we\ndampen the attachment we have not only to our selves but also to\nparticular others such as friends and family members. Buddhism is\nespecially well known for its advocacy of detachment, not only from\nmaterial possessions, worldly power and status, but also from\nparticular people and communities. For example, in Ashvaghosha’s\npoem on “Nanda the Fair,” the Buddha explains to Nanda\nthat delusion alone ties one person to another (Conze, 1959, 110). The\nargument is that a family is like a group of travelers at an inn who\ncome together for a while and then part. No one belongs to anyone\nelse. A family is held together only as sand is held in a clenched\nfist. A number of Neo-Confucians, such as the Cheng brothers and Zhu\nXi, harshly accused Buddhists of selfishness while not quite squaring\nthat accusation with the ideal of the Boddhisattvas in Mahayana\nBuddhism, who delay their entrance into Nirvana, their final release\nfrom suffering, until all beings are liberated from suffering. What\nthe neo-Confucians might have been saying is that the real appeal of\nBuddhism is to the selfish impulse to save oneself, regardless of what\ntheir doctrines say. \nHowever fair or unfair this accusation, issues do arise as to the\ndesirability and realistic possibility of assuming the kind of\ndetached attitude the Buddhists upheld, and not surprisingly, the\nissues are similar to ones raised by Daoist identification with the\ncosmos. As the discussion of Zhuangzi and wife made clear, it may be\npossible to distinguish as an alternative to the pure and complete\ndetachment exemplified in Ashvagosha another kind that is consistent\nwith emotional involvement with others for as long as they are given\nto us.","contact.mail":"dbwong@duke.edu","contact.domain":"duke.edu"}]
