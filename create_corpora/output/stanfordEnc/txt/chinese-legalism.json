They\nbelieved that human beings—commoners and elites alike—will\nforever remain selfish and covetous of riches and fame, and one should\nnot expect them to behave morally. Rather, a viable sociopolitical\nsystem should allow individuals to pursue their selfish interests\nexclusively in ways that benefit the state, viz. agriculture and\nwarfare. Parallel to this, a proper administrative system should allow\nofficials to benefit from ranks and emoluments, but also prevent them\nfrom subverting the ruler’s power. Both systems are unconcerned\nwith individual morality of the rulers and the ruled; rather they\nshould be based on impersonal norms and standards: laws,\nadministrative regulations, clearly defined rules of promotion and\ndemotion, and the like.\n\n\nLegalist thinkers contributed greatly to the formation of\nChina’s empire both on the theoretical level and as political\npractitioners; and many of their ideas continued to be employed\nthroughout China’s history. Yet their derisive views of\nmoralizing discourse of their rivals, their haughty stance toward\nfellow intellectuals, and their pronouncedly anti-ministerial rhetoric\nall gained them immense dislike among the imperial literati. From\nChina’s second imperial dynasty, the Han (206/202 BCE–220\nCE) on, the prestige of Legalism declined; only a few texts associated\nwith this current survived intact; and even in the modern period,\nnotwithstanding sporadic outbursts of interest in Legalism, this\ncurrent has not received adequate scholarly attention.\n\nThe term “Legalist school” (fa jia\n法家) is ubiquitous in studies of early Chinese political\nphilosophy. Despite manifold criticisms of its inaccuracy (e.g.,\nGoldin 2011), the term may still be usefully employed, as long as two\nmajor points are taken into account. First, Legalists were not a\nself-aware and organized intellectual current; rather the name was\ncoined as a post-factum categorization of certain thinkers and texts,\nand its primary function before the twentieth century was that of a\nbibliographical category in imperial libraries. Therefore, the\nidentification of any thinker or text as “Legalist” will\nforever remain arbitrary; the term may be used as a heuristic\nconvention but should not be employed (pace Creel 1974) as an\nanalytical device. Second, “Legalism” is a problematic\nname. The Chinese term fa jia is already misleading, because\nit inadvertently reduces the rich intellectual content of this current\nto a single keyword, fa. “Legalism” is a doubly\nmisleading English translation, because the semantic field of the term\nfa 法 is much broader than “law”; it refers\nalso to methods, standards, impersonal regulations and the like (Creel\n1974: 147–149; Goldin 2011). It is incongruent, then, to discuss\nthe fa jia within the context of the Occidental notion of\n“the rule of law,” as was popular in early modern Chinese\nscholarship (e.g., Hsiao 1979: 442–446) and as is sometimes done\neven nowadays (Fu Zhengyuan 1996: 158–161). If these intrinsic\ninaccuracies of the term “Legalism” are borne in mind, it\ncan be employed—as in what follows—merely for heuristic\nconvenience. The term is simply so widespread in scholarly literature\nthat replacing it with a new designation will just further confuse the\nreaders. \nAlthough the term “Legalism” was coined only during the\nHan 漢dynasty (206/202 BCE-220 CE), its roots—or more\nprecisely the idea of grouping together several thinkers who will be\neventually dubbed “Legalists”—can be traced already\nto Han Fei 韓非 (d. 233 BCE), who is often considered the\nmost significant representative of this intellectual current. In\nchapter 43, “Defining the Standards” (“Ding\nfa” 定法) of Han Feizi\n韓非子, the thinker presents himself as a\nsynthesizer and improver of the ideas of two of his predecessors,\nShang Yang 商鞅 (d. 338 BCE) and Shen Buhai\n申不害 (d. 337 BCE) (Han Feizi 43:\n397–400). Pairing Shen Buhai and Shang Yang, and adding Han Fei\nhimself to them became common from the early Han dynasty (see, e.g.\nHuainanzi 6: 230; 11:423; 20: 833). The historian Sima Qian\n司馬遷 (ca. 145–90 BCE) identified these three\nthinkers as adherents of the teaching of “performance and\ntitle” (xing ming 刑名) (Shiji 62:\n2146; 68: 2227; translation borrowed from Goldin 2013: 8). This term\nwas synonymous to the later fa jia (Creel 1974: 140). \nThe first to use the term fa jia was Sima Qian’s\nfather, Sima Tan 司馬談 (d. 110 BCE). In an essay on\nthe “essence of the six schools of thought,” Sima Tan\nnotices that fa jia are “strict and have little\nkindness,” and “do not distinguish between kin and\nstranger, nor differentiate between noble and base: everything is\ndetermined by the standard (or law, fa).” Sima Tan\ncriticized the Legalists’ approach as “a one-time policy\nthat could not be constantly applied,” but also hailed the\nfa jia for “honoring rulers and derogating subjects,\nand clearly distinguishing offices so that no one can overstep [his\nresponsibilities]” (Shiji 130: 3289–3291; for\ntranslations cf. Smith 2003: 141; Goldin 2011: 89). A century later\nthe bibliographical category of fa jia was created. The Han\nlibrarian Liu Xiang 劉向 (79–8 BCE) identified ten\ntexts in the Han imperial library as belonging to fa jia\n(Han shu 30: 1735). Thenceforth “Legalist school”\nremained a major category of imperial book catalogues. Since the early\n20th century this term has come to be widely used for\nclassification and analysis of early Chinese thought. \nOf the ten “Legalist” texts in the Han imperial catalogue,\nsix ceased circulating more than a millennium ago; two arrived at our\ndays relatively intact, and of two others only a few fragments\nsurvived vicissitudes of time. The earliest (in terms of its\ncomposition) surviving text is the Book of Lord Shang\n(Shang jun shu 商君書), attributed to Shang\nYang (aka Gongsun Yang 公孫鞅 or Lord Shang/Lord of\nShang 商君), a major reformer who orchestrated the rise of\nthe state of Qin 秦 to the position of a leading power of the\nChinese world. In the process of transmission, the book lost at least\nfive chapters; a few others had been badly damaged, becoming barely\nlegible. Since the late 18th century efforts have been made\nto prepare a critical edition of the text and amend its corrupted\nparts; yet more than two centuries passed before the comprehensive\ncritical edition was published (Zhang Jue 2012). The text is highly\nheterogeneous in terms of its composition: some chapters were likely\npenned by Shang Yang himself; others may come from the hand of his\nimmediate disciples and followers, but a few other were written\ndecades and even more than a century after his death (Pines 2016a).\nThis said, the text presents a relatively coherent ideological vision,\nand it is likely that it reflects intellectual evolution of what Zheng\nLiangshu (1989) dubbed Shang Yang’s “intellectual\ncurrent” (xuepai 學派). \nThe second surviving text, Han Feizi\n韓非子, is attributed to Han Fei, a scion of the\nruling family from the state of Hán 韓 (not to be\nconfused with the Hàn 漢 dynasty), a tragic figure who\nwas allegedly killed in the custody of the King of Qin, whom Han Fei\nwanted to serve. Of all Legalist texts in the Han imperial catalogue,\nthe Han Feizi fared the best over the vicissitudes of time:\nall of its 55 chapters attested in the Han catalog are still intact.\nThe issue of whether or not the entire book had been penned by Han Fei\nis debatable: considerable differences among the chapters in terms of\nstyle and mode of argumentation lead not a few scholars to suspect\nthat they come from different authors. On the other hand, the\ndifferences may be explained as reflecting the process of Han\nFei’s intellectual maturation, or the need to adapt\nargumentation to different audiences; and since most of the chapters\npresent a coherent outlook, it increases the likelihood that most of\nthem were indeed written by Han Fei (Goldin 2013). Overall, the\nHan Feizi is considered as philosophically and literally more\nengaging than the Book of Lord Shang, and it has been more\nwidely studied in China, Japan, and in the West. \nTwo other Legalist texts mentioned in the Han imperial catalog did not\nsurvive intact, but lengthy quotations from them in the imperial\nencyclopedia have allowed partial reconstruction of their content.\nShēnzi 申子 is attributed\nto Shen Buhai, who acted as a chancellor of the state of Hán\n韓 in the middle fourth century BCE, and who is credited with\nmajor administrative improvement there. Of the original six chapters\nfewer than three dozen fragments remain intact (Creel 1974). Another\ntext, Shènzi 慎子 is attributed\nto Shen Dao 慎到 (fl. ca. 300 BCE), of whom very little is\nknown (it is even possible that the figure of Shen Dao a is conflation\nof several personalities; see Xu Fuhong 2013: 2–8). Of original\n42 chapters, seven survived (albeit in an incomplete form) in a\nseventh-century CE encyclopedy; altogether over 120 surviving\nfragments of the text are considered authentic (Thompson 1979; cf. Xu\nFuhong 2013). In what follows, to avoid confusion between\nShēnzi and\nShènzi, they will be referred to as works of\nShen Buhai and Shen Dao respectively. \nThe above four texts are the major repository of Legalist ideology.\nSeveral other texts appear to be closely related to these in terms of\nideological outlook and vocabulary: of particular importance for\ndiscussing Legalism are several chapters of a heterogeneous\nmiscellany, Guanzi 管子, which is nominally\nattributed to another major reformer, Guan Zhong 管仲 (d.\n645 BCE) from the state of Qi 齊, but which was in reality\nproduced between the fourth and the second centuries BCE. Of further\nrelevance for understanding Legalist thought are a few segments of\nanother multi-authored compilation, the\nLüshi chunqiu\n呂氏春秋 (ca. 240 BCE), and memorials of the\nman who is considered the architect of the Qin 秦 Empire\n(221–207 BCE), Li Si 李斯 (d. 208 BCE) (for Li Si,\nsee Bodde 1938). In addition, many more texts and thinkers are at\ntimes identified by scholars as “Legalist”; but since most\nof these identifications are quite arbitrary they will not be\nconsidered in the framework of the current\n discussion.[1] \nLegalism is just one of the many intellectual currents that flourished\nin China during the three centuries prior to the imperial unification\nof 221 BCE. This period, often identified as the age of the\n“Hundred Schools” was exceptionally rich in terms of\npolitical thought. The outburst of interest in political issues was\nnot accidental: it took place against the backdrop of a severe\nsystemic crisis. The end of the Springs-and-Autumns period (Chunqiu\n春秋, 770–453 BCE) was marked by the progressive\ndisintegration of political structures in the Zhou 周 realm (the\nthen Chinese world). Gradually, the Zhou world became entangled in a\nweb of debilitating struggles among rival polities, between powerful\nnobles and the lords within each polity, as well as among aristocratic\nlineages and among rival branches within major lineages. By the fourth\ncentury BCE, a degree of re-centralization in individual polities was\nachieved, but interstate warfare further intensified, giving, in\nretrospect, the new era an ominous name: the age of the Warring States\n(Zhanguo 戰國, 453–221 BCE). As wars became ever\nbloodier and more devastating, and with no adequate diplomatic means\nto settle the conflicts in sight, most thinkers and statesmen came to\nan understanding that unity of “All-under-Heaven”\n(tianxia 天下) was the only means to attain peace\nand stability (Pines 2000). How to bring this unity about and how to\n“stabilize All-under-Heaven” became the central topic\naddressed by competing thinkers. In the final account, the\nLegalists’ ability to provide the most compelling answers to\nthis question became the singular source of their ideological\nappeal. \nCrises and bloodshed aside, the Warring States period was also an age\nrife with opportunities for intellectually active individuals. It was\nan exceptionally dynamic period, marked by novel departures and\nprofound changes in all walks of life. Politically, the loose\naristocratic entities of the Springs-and-Autumns period were replaced\nby centralized and bureaucratized territorial states (Lewis 1999).\nEconomically, the introduction of iron utensils (Wagner 1993)\nrevolutionized agriculture, allowing higher yields, prompting the\ndevelopment of wastelands, and bringing about demographic growth, as\nwell as accelerating urbanization and commercialization of the\neconomy. Militarily, new technologies, such as the crossbow, as well\nas new forms of military organization, brought about the replacement\nof aristocratic chariot-led armies by mass infantry armies staffed by\npeasant conscripts, resulting in a radical increase in warfare’s\nscale and complexity (Lewis 1999). And socially, the hereditary\naristocracy that dominated the Zhou world during much of the Bronze\nAge (ca. 1500–400 BCE) was eclipsed by a much broader stratum of\nshi 士 (sometimes translated as “men of\nservice”), who owed their position primarily to their abilities\nrather than their pedigree (Pines 2013c). These profound changes\nrequired new approaches to a variety of administrative, economic,\nmilitary, social, and ethical issues: old truths had to be\nreconsidered or reinterpreted. For intellectuals eager to tackle a\nvariety of new questions—and particularly for the\nLegalists—this was a golden age. \nEach of the competing “schools of thought” sought ways to\nimprove the functioning of the state, to attain sociopolitical\nstability, and to bring about peace under Heaven; yet among a variety\nof answers those provided by the Legalists appear to be most\npractical. This is not incidental: after all, some of the major\nLegalist thinkers, most notably Shang Yang, were the leading reformers\nof their age. Legalist thinkers were at the forefront of\nadministrative and sociopolitical innovation; they were the most ready\nto dispense with bygone norms and paradigms; and they were more\npragmatic and result-oriented than most of their ideological rivals.\nOn the other hand, their dismissive attitude toward traditional\nculture and toward moralizing discourse, as well as their highly\ncritical stance toward other members of educated elite, and their\npronounced anti-ministerial approach, earned them considerable enmity.\nIn the long term, Sima Tan’s observation seems correct: the\nLegalists’ recipes were highly effective in the short run but\nwere much less attractive in the long term. \nLegalism is at times compared with modern social sciences (Schwartz\n1985), and this comparison grasps well some of its characteristics.\nAngus C. Graham (1989: 269) notices that Legalists are the first\npolitical philosophers in China “to start not from how society\nought to be but how it is.” Indeed, this was the most\npractical-oriented of all preimperial intellectual currents. Its\nproclaimed goal was to create “rich state and powerful\narmy” (fu guo qiang bing\n 富國強兵),[2]\n which would be the precondition for future unification of the entire\nsubcelestial realm. The thinkers’ focus was on how to attain\nthis goal, and less on philosophical speculations. Consequently, their\nwritings are generally devoid of overarching moral considerations, or\nconformity to divine will—topoi which recur in the\nwritings of the followers of Confucius 孔子 (551–479\nBCE) and Mozi 墨子 (ca. 460–390 BCE). Cosmological\nstipulations of political order, which became hugely popular after the\nLaozi 老子 (fourth century BCE) are of slightly\nhigher importance for the Legalists than morality or religion: they\nare referred to in some of Shen Buhai and Shen Dao’s fragments\nand, more notably, in several chapters of the Han Feizi. Yet\nthese speculations are not essential for these thinkers’\narguments: hence, pace attempts to consider cosmological\ndigressions of Han Fei as foundations of his political philosophy\n(Wang and Chang 1986), it would be more accurate to see them as\nargumentative devices that were “not fully assimilated”\ninto Han Fei’s thought (Graham 1991: 285; cf. Goldin 2013:\n 14–18).[3]\n Generally, Legalist thinkers display considerable philosophical\nsophistication only when they need to justify their departures from\nconventional approaches of other intellectual currents. In this regard\ntheir views of historical evolution and of human nature are highly\nengaging. \nThe Warring States period was an age of comprehensive sociopolitical\nchange, and thinkers of different intellectual affiliations had to\ncome to terms with this change. The majority tried to accommodate it\nwithin the framework of the “changing with the times”\nparadigm (Kern 2000: 170–174): namely, certain innovations and\nmodifications of existent policies are inevitable, but these do not\nrequire a radical overhaul of the current sociopolitical system, and\ndo not undermine the usefulness of the past as a guideline for the\npresent. Legalists were much more resolute in their willingness to\ndispense with traditional modes of rule, and they questioned the very\nrelevance of the past to the present. Their attack on supporters of\nlearning from the past was twofold. First, there was simply no uniform\nmodel of orderly rule in the past to be emulated. Second, and more\nsubstantially, society evolves, and this evolution turns behavioral\nmodes, institutions, and even values of the past obsolete. \nThe first and best-known argument in favor of dispensing with the past\nmodels is presented in the first chapter of the Book of Lord\nShang. Shang Yang is cited saying: “there is no single way\nto order the generation; to benefit the state, one need not imitate\nantiquity” (Shang jun shu 1:4; Book of Lord Shang\n1.4 ). Han Fei explains further: past models are irrelevant not\nonly because they were changing from time to time, but also because we\ncannot verify exactly what they were. The way of the former paragons\nis bitterly contested, and those who claim the authority of\nantiquity—such as adherents of Confucius and Mozi—simply\ncannot agree on the lessons of the past that are to be applied in the\npresent: “He who claims certain knowledge without examining the\nissue is a fool; he who relies on things which are impossible to\nascertain is an impostor. It is therefore clear that those who rely on\nformer kings, and claim they can determine with certainty [the way of\nthe paragon legendary rulers] Yao and Shun, are either fools or\nimpostors” (Han Feizi 50: 457). \nYet having postulated the impossibility of learning from past models,\nShang Yang and Han Fei propose an alternative lesson that can be\nlearnt: that changing circumstances may require not a piecemeal but a\ncomprehensive readjustment of the sociopolitical system. To\ndemonstrate the magnitude of change in the past, both thinkers turn to\nremotest antiquity, and trace how the state was formed. For instance,\nShang Yang depicts social evolution from primeval promiscuous life to\nan incipient stratified society and then to a fully mature state with\nlaws, regulations, officials, and the power of coercion (Shang jun\nshu 7: 51–53; Book of Lord Shang 7.1). At the earlier\nstages of human history, the people could be constrained by moral\nsuasion; yet this was simply because that was the age of relative\nabundance: “Formerly… the people cut trees and\nslaughtered animals [for food]; the people were few, whereas trees and\nanimals plenty. … Men plowed to obtain food, women wove to\nobtain clothing; [the ruler] used neither punishments nor regulations,\nbut there was order” (Shang jun shu 18: 107; Book\nof Lord Shang 18.1). Han Fei echoes Shang Yang: in the remote\npast “the people were few whereas goods were plenty; hence\npeople did not compete” (Han Feizi 49: 443). Now, this\nage of primeval morality has gone forever. Both thinkers emphasize the\ndevastating impact of demographic growth on human mores.\n“Nowadays, five children are not considered too many, and each\nchild also has five children; the grandfather is still alive, and he\nalready has twenty-five grandchildren. Therefore, the people are\nplenty whereas commodities and goods are few; people work laboriously,\nbut provisions are scanty; hence the people compete” (Han\nFeizi 49: 443). Under these new circumstances, moral norms are no\nlonger relevant; contention is the rule, and it can be quelled only\nthrough coercion.  \nThe evolutionary view of history and especially the emphasis that\neconomic conditions can alter moral values, distinguish the Legalists\ncritically from proponents of alternative models of state formation\n(Pines 2013a). The Legalists imply that everything is changeable: as\nsocioeconomic conditions change, human behavior changes as well; and\nthis in turn requires adaptation of political institutions. Shang Yang\nsummarizes: \nWhen the affairs of the world change, one should implement a different\nWay. … Therefore, it is said: “When the people are\nignorant, one can become monarch through knowledge; when the\ngeneration is knowledgeable, one can become monarch through\nforce” (Shang jun shu 7: 53; Book of Lord\nShang 7.1–7.2). \nThe last phrase represents the rationale behind Shang Yang’s\nmodel of state formation. If radical restructuring of society was\nlegitimate in the past, so it is in the present. In the current\nsituation, when the people are “knowledgeable,” a powerful\nstate, which is able to coerce its subjects, is the only viable\nsolution. The Book of Lord Shang (but not Han Feizi)\nallowed for the possibility that in the future the need for excessive\nreliance on coercion would end and a milder, morality-driven political\nstructure would evolve, but these utopian digressions are of minor\nimportance in the text (Pines 2013a). What matters is the bottom line:\nradical reforms were inevitable in the past; and they are inevitable\nin the present. \nThe second pillar of Legalist political philosophy is their view of\nhuman nature. Legalists eschew the discussion of whether or not human\nbadness or goodness are inborn, or whether or not all humans possess\nfundamentally similar qualities. What matters for them is, first, that\nthe overwhelming majority of human beings are selfish and covetous;\nsecond, that this situation cannot be changed through education or\nself-cultivation; and, third, that human beings’ selfishness can\nbecome an asset to the ruler rather than a threat. That “the\npeople follow after benefit as water flows downward” (Shang\njun shu 23:131; Book of Lord Shang 23.2) is a given: the\ntask is to allow the people to satisfy their desire for glory and\nriches in a way that will accord with, rather than contradict, the\nstate’s needs. Shang Yang explains how to attain this: \nwherever the name (repute) and benefit meet, the people will go in\nthis direction.… Farming is what the people consider bitter;\nwar is what the people consider dangerous. Yet they brave what they\nconsider bitter and perform what they consider dangerous because of\nthe calculation [of a name and benefit]. … When benefits come\nfrom land, the people exhaust their strength; when the name comes from\nwar, the people are ready to die (Shang jun shu 6:\n45–46; Book of Lord Shang 6.4–6.5). \nThe people covet wealth and fame; they are afraid of punishments: this\nis their basic disposition (qing 情). This disposition\nis not to be altered but to be properly understood and then\nmanipulated: “When a law is established without investigating\nthe people’s disposition, it will not succeed” (Shang\njun shu 8: 63; Book of Lord Shang 8.3). To direct the\npopulace toward the pursuits which benefit the state, namely\nagriculture and warfare, even though they consider these “bitter\nand dangerous,” one should establish a combination of positive\nand negative incentives. The entire sociopolitical system advocated by\nShang Yang can be seen as the realization of this recommendation\n(Pines 2016b). \nThe Legalists’ view of the people as covetous and selfish was\nnot exceptional to this intellectual current: it was shared, among\nothers, by as significant a Confucian thinker as Xunzi\n荀子 (ca. 310–230 BCE) and is evident in many other\ntexts (Sato 2013). Yet in marked distinction from Xunzi and from other\nConfucian thinkers, the Legalists dismissed the possibility that the\nelite—rulers and ministers alike—would be able to overcome\ntheir selfishness. The topic of the ruler’s quality will be\ndiscussed below; here, suffice it to focus on that of the ministers.\nFor thinkers from the entire spectrum of Confucian thought, it was\naxiomatic that the government should be staffed by morally upright\n“noble men” who would serve out of commitment to the ruler\nabove and the people below. For the Legalists, it was equally\naxiomatic that this cannot be the case. Shen Dao explains: \nAmong the people, everybody acts for himself. If you [try to] alter\nthem and cause them to act for you, then there will be none whom you\ncan attain and employ. … In circumstances where people are not\nable to act in their own interests, those above will not employ them.\nEmploy the people for their own [interests], do not employ them for\nyour sake: then there will be none whom you cannot make use of\n(Shenzi, 24–25; Harris 2016: 112).  \nShen Dao dismisses the possibility that the ministers will be driven\nby moral commitment; on the contrary, such exceptional individuals\nshould not be employed at all. This sentiment recurs in Han\nFeizi, a text that expresses with utmost clarity its belief that\nevery member of the elite—like any member of\nsociety—pursues his own interests (cf. Goldin 2005: 58–65;\n2013). Morally upright officials do exist, but these are exceptional\nindividuals: “one cannot find even a dozen upright and\ntrustworthy men of service (shi 士), while the\nofficials within the boundaries are counted in hundreds. If one cannot\nemploy but upright and trustworthy men of service, then there will be\nnot enough people to fill in the offices” (Han Feizi\n49: 451). This awareness is the source of the thinker’s great\nconcern with regard to the ongoing and irresolvable power struggle\nbetween the ruler and the members of his entourage (see below), and is\nalso a source of Han Fei’s (and other Legalists’)\ninsistence on the priority of impersonal norms and regulations in\ndealing with the ruler-minister relations. Proper administrative\nsystem should not be based on trust and respect for ministers; rather\nthey should be tightly controlled. A political system that presupposes\nhuman selfishness is the only viable political system.  \nOne of the (in)famous controversial dictums in the Book of Lord\nShang states: “When the people are weak, the state is\nstrong; hence the state that possesses the Way devotes itself to\nweakening the people” (Shang jun shu 20: 121; Book\nof Lord Shang  20.1). Elsewhere, the text specifies: \nIn the past, those who were able to regulate All-under-Heaven first\nhad to regulate their own people; those who were able to overcome the\nenemy had first to overcome their own people. The root of overcoming\nthe people is controlling the people as the metalworker controls metal\nand the potter clay. When the roots are not firm, the people will be\nlike flying birds and running animals: Who will then be able to\nregulate them? The root of the people is law. Hence, those who excel\nat orderly rule block the people with law; then a [good] name and\nlands can be attained. (Shang jun shu 18: 107; Book of\nLord Shang 18.2) \nThese and many similar sayings explain Shang Yang’s image as a\n“people-basher.” No other thinker was as explicit as he in\npointing at the persistent contradiction between society (“the\npeople”) and the state. The people’s intrinsic selfishness\nconstantly endangers social order; and to safeguard this order, the\nruler should resolutely rein in his subjects through the law\n(fa 法 in this context refers primarily to punitive\nlaws). The state should tightly control its subjects: the system of\nmandatory registration of the population and creation of mutual\nresponsibility groups among the populace will ensure that every crime\nis denounced and the criminal—particularly those who abscond\nfrom the battlefield—will know that “there is no place to\nflee from the army ranks, and migrants can find no refuge.”\n(Shang jun shu 18: 108;Shang jun shu 18.3).\nMoreover, to overawe the people, the text advocates inflicting heavy\npunishments for even petty offenses, as only then will the people be\nsufficiently scared as to behave properly. Eventually, harsh\npunishments will eliminate the very need for punishments: \nTo prevent wrongdoing and stop transgressions, nothing is better than\nmaking punishments heavy. When punishments are heavy and [criminals]\nare inevitably captured, then the people dare not try [to break the\nlaw]. Hence, there are no penalized people in the state. When there\nare no penalized people in the state, it is said, then:\n“Clarifying punishments [means] no executions.” (Shang\njun shu 17: 101;Shang jun shu 17.3) \nDue to above pronouncements, Shang Yang gained notoriety as an\nadvocate of oppression; but actually his attitude toward the people is\nmuch more balanced than is often imagined. The Book of Lord\nShang frequently speaks of “loving/caring for the\npeople” (ai min 愛民) and “benefiting\nthe people” (li min 利民), echoing other\ncontemporaneous texts which proclaimed the people’s well-being\nas the ultimate goal of policy-making (Pines 2009: 201–203). The\npeople are not just the potential enemy of the ruler: they are his\nmajor asset. Without their hard labor in the fields or their bravery\non the battlefield, the state is doomed. Yet the people will not\nembrace tilling and waging war just out of fear of coercion. A more\ncomplex system is needed: one that will introduce attractive positive\nincentives along with awe-inspiring negative ones. Shang Yang\nexplains: \nHuman beings have likes and dislikes; hence, the people can be ruled.\nThe ruler must investigate likes and dislikes. Likes and dislikes are\nthe root of rewards and penalties. The disposition of the people is to\nlike ranks and emoluments and to dislike punishments and penalties.\nThe ruler sets up the two in order to guide the people’s will and to\nestablish whatever he desires. (Shang jun shu 9: 65; Book\nof Lord Shang 9.3) \nPunishments and penalties can deter the people from misbehavior, but\nto encourage them to do “whatever the ruler desires,”\npositive incentives—“ranks and emoluments”—are\nno less important. The ruler’s major goal, as Shang Yang\nreiterates incessantly, is to turn his subjects into diligent farmers\nand valiant soldiers. This can be attained only if engagement in these\n“bitter and dangerous” occupations will be the exclusive\nway to secure material riches and glory. This understanding stands at\nthe background of Shang Yang’s most celebrated reform: the\nreplacement of Qin’s traditional hereditary aristocratic order\nwith the new system of “ranks of merit.” \nThe system of 20 (initially fewer) “ranks of merit”\nintroduced by Shang Yang was one of the most daring acts of social\nengineering in human history. This system became the cornerstone of\nsocial life in Qin. The lowest ranks were distributed for military\nachievements, particularly decapitating enemy soldiers, or could be\npurchased in exchange for extra grain yields; successful rank-holders\ncould be incorporated into the military or civilian administration and\nthereafter be promoted up the social ladder. Each rank granted its\nholder economic, social, and legal privileges; and since the ranks\nwere not fully inheritable, the system generated considerable social\nmobility (see details in Loewe 1960 and 2010; Pines et al. 2014:\n24–26; Pines 2016b). The new system attempted to unify the\nsocial, economic, and political hierarchy under the government’s\ncontrol, which in turn required the elimination of alternative avenues\nof enhancing one’s socioeconomic and political status. This\nlatter concern is strongly pronounced throughout the Book of Lord\nShang: \nThe means whereby the sovereign encourages the people are offices and\nranks; the means by which the state prospers are agriculture and\nwarfare. Today the people seek offices and ranks, yet they are\nattainable not through agriculture and warfare but through crafty\nwords and empty ways: this is called to exhaust the people.(Shang\njun shu 3: 20; Book of Lord Shang 3.1). \nThe text insists repeatedly that the only way to make agriculture and\nwarfare attractive is to prevent any alternative route toward\nenrichment and empowerment. It specifies that “those who do not\nwork but eat, who do not fight but attain glory, who have no rank but\nare respected, who have no emolument but are rich, who have no office\nbut lead—“these are called ‘villains’”\n(Shang jun shu 18: 111; Book of Lord Shang 18.6).\nAny group which tries to bypass engagement in agriculture and\nwarfare—be these merchants who amass riches without tilling or\ntalkative intellectuals who seek promotion without contributing to the\nstate economically or militarily—should be suppressed or at\nleast squeezed out of profits. Nothing—neither learning, nor\ncommerce, nor even artisanship—should distract the people from\nfarming and making war. The text summarizes: \nHence, my teaching causes those among the people who seek benefits to\ngain them nowhere else but in tilling and those who want to avoid harm\nto escape nowhere but to war. Within the borders, everyone among the\npeople first devotes himself to tilling and warfare and only then\nobtains whatever pleases him. Hence, though the territory is small,\ngrain is plenty, and though the people are few, the army is powerful.\nHe who is able to implement these two within the borders will\naccomplish the way of Hegemon and Monarch. (Shang jun shu 25:\n139; Book of Lord Shang 25.5) \nTo rule and control the people effectively, the government should rely\non an extensive bureaucracy; but this bureaucracy in turn should be\nproperly staffed and tightly monitored. It is with this regard that\nthe Legalists made a lasting contribution to China’s\nadministrative thought and administrative practices. Their strongly\npronounced suspicion of scheming ministers and selfish officials was\nconducive to the promulgation of impersonal means of recruitment,\npromotion, demotion, and performance control. These means became\nindispensable for China’s bureaucratic apparatus for millennia\nto come (Creel 1974). \nOne of the primary issues that the rulers of the Warring States faced\nwas that of recruitment into government service. During the\naristocratic Springs-and-Autumns period, the overwhelming majority of\nofficials were scions of hereditary ministerial lineages; only\nexceptionally could outsiders join the government. This situation\nchanged by the fifth century BCE, as aristocratic lineages were\nlargely eliminated in internecine struggles and members of lower\nnobility—the so-called “men of service,”\nshi 士—could advance up the ladder of\nofficialdom. It was then that the new meritocratic discourse of\n“elevating the worthy” (shang xian\n尚賢) proliferated and upward social mobility became\nlegitimate (Pines 2013c). Yet who were the “worthy” and\nhow to determine one’s worthiness was a matter of considerable\nuncertainty and confusion. While certain texts presented highly\nsophisticated ways of discerning the employee’s true worth\n(Richter 2005), their recommendations required exceptional\nperspicacity of an employer and were largely impractical. Instead, the\nmost popular way of recruitment was based on a notion of\n“recognition” of one’s worth (Henry 1987): an\nemployee was recommended to the ruler (or to a high official),\ninterviewed, and then his worth was “recognized” and high\nposition assigned. This widespread practice was deeply resented by the\nLegalists. The very idea of reliance on vague concept of\n“worthiness” and on personal impression of the ruler as\nthe primary means of recruitment was in their eyes fundamentally\nflawed, because it allowed manifold manipulations. Shang Yang explains\nwhy “worthiness” based on one’s reputation is an\nintrinsically problematic concept: \nWhat the world calls a “worthy” is one who is defined as\nupright; but those who define him as good and upright are his clique\n(dang 黨). When you hear his words, you consider him\nable; when you ask his partisans, they approve it. Hence, one is\nennobled before one has any merits; one is punished before one has\ncommitted a crime. (Shang jun shu 25: 136–137; Book\nof Lord Shang 25.1) \n“Worthiness” is too vague and too prone to manipulation by\npartisans to serve as an adequate means of promotion; and relying on\none’s reputation or on an interview with the ruler are equally\nflawed methods. Similar views are echoed in Han Feizi and in\nother Legalist texts, such as “Relying on Standards”\n(“Ren fa” 任法) chapter of Guanzi\n(Rickett 1998: 144–151). Shen Dao further warns the ruler that\nif he decides on promotions and demotions on the basis of his personal\nimpression, this will cause inflated expectations or excessive\nresentment among his servants: \nWhen the ruler abandons the standard (fa 法) and relies\non himself to govern, then punishments and rewards, recruitment and\ndemotion all arise out of the ruler’s heart. If this is the\ncase, then even if rewards are appropriate, the expectations are\ninsatiable; even if the punishments are appropriate, lenience is\nsought ceaselessly. If the ruler abandons the standard and relies on\nhis heart to decide upon the degree [of awards and punishments], then\nidentical merits will be rewarded differently, and identical crimes\nwill be punished differently. It is from this that resentment arises.\n(Shenzi, 52; Harris 2016: 120) \nDecisions on matters of promotion and demotion should never be based\non the ruler’s heart; not only because he can be misled and\nmanipulated by unscrupulous aides, but also because any\ndecision—even if correct one—which is not based on\nimpersonal standards will cause dissatisfaction among his underlings\n(see more in Harris 2016: 31–34). An alternative will be a set of\nclear impersonal rules that will regulate recruitment and promotion of\nofficials. For Shang Yang, recruitment will be based on the ranks of\nmerit. Han Fei remains doubtful about these: after all, why should\nvaliant soldiers who gained ranks of merit become good officials? Han\nFei himself does not solve the problem of initial recruitment but\ndevelops ways to monitor subsequent promotion of an official: \nThus, as for the officials of an enlightened ruler: chief ministers\nand chancellors must rise from among local officials; valiant generals\nmust rise from among the ranks. One who has merit should be awarded:\nthen ranks and emoluments are bountiful and they are ever more\nencouraging; one who is promoted and ascends to higher positions, his\nofficial responsibilities increase, and he performs his tasks ever\nmore orderly. When ranks and emoluments are great, while official\nresponsibilities are dealt with in an orderly way—this is the\nWay of the Monarch. (Han Feizi 50: 460) \nPromotion should be dissociated once and for all from the\nruler’s (or his ministers’) personal judgments. One should\nsimply check an incumbent’s performance on the lower level of\nbureaucracy, and promote him to higher positions with ever more\nresponsibilities. This objective process of promotion according to\nmeasurable and objective merits became one of the hallmarks of the\nChinese administrative system throughout the imperial era and\nbeyond. \nRewards and punishments (primarily promotion and demotion) are the\nmajor handles through which the ruler has to control his officials.\nBut how to judge their performance? Here the Legalists put forward the\nidea of xing ming 刑名: “performance and\ntitle.” Although this compound is attested only in Han\nFeizi, throughout the Former Han dynasty it was most commonly\nidentified with what we nowadays call “Legalism.” Han Fei\nexplains what he means by xing ming: \nPerformance and title refers to statements and tasks. The minister\npresents his statement; the ruler assigns him tasks according to his\nstatement, and evaluates his merits exclusively according to the task.\nWhen the merit is in accordance with the task, and the task is in\naccordance with the statement, then [the minister] is awarded; when\nthe merit is not in accordance with the task, and the task is not in\naccordance with the statement, then he is punished. (Han\nFeizi 7: 40–41) \nThe proposed way of estimating the official’s performance is not\nentirely reasonable (why punish a minister for over-performing?) but\nat least it tries to establish firm criteria of evaluation, which in\nthis case are related to the minister’s own “bid”\n(Goldin 2013: 8–10). The advantages are clear: the system will\nprevent ministerial manipulations and will reaffirm the ruler’s\ncontrol over his officials. This latter point is of particular\nimportance to the Legalists. Various means through which the ruler\nshould monitor the ministers are named in Han Feizi and other\nLegalist texts as “technique” (shu 術) or\n“rules” (shù 數) (the meaning of\nboth terms may overlap: Creel 1974: 125–134; Yang 2010). Both\nterms are similar to fa but are narrower in their meaning,\nreferring primarily to a variety of means through which the ruler\ncontrols his officials. Han Fei claims that shu is the\nhallmark of Shen Buhai’s ideas, and explains its meaning as\nfollows: \nTechnique is to give official positions in accordance with one’s\nresponsibility, to investigate reality in accordance with the name, to\nhold the handles of death and life, to assess the abilities of every\nminister. This is what the ruler should hold. (Han Feizi 43:\n397) \nThis passage explains the general principles of Shen Buhai’s\n“techniques” but does not detail how they functioned.\n“Techniques” and “rules” are referred in\nLegalist texts as the best means of preserving the ruler’s\ncontrol: the enlightened ruler relies on these, while the benighted\none in contrast casts these away and subsequently is misled by his\nministers’ delusive words and by persuaders’ inducements\n(shui 說). Yet amid the strong emphasis on the power of\ntechniques, rules, laws, and regulations, we can discover the sober\nrealization that even these are not always enough, and that a perfect\nadministrative system simply cannot come into existence. Thus, in one\nof the later chapters of the Book of Lord Shang it is\nsaid: \nNowadays, [the ruler] relies on many officials and numerous clerks; to\nmonitor them he establishes assistants and supervisors. Assistants are\ninstalled and supervisors are established to prohibit [officials] from\npursuing [personal] profit; yet assistants and supervisors also seek\nprofit, so how they will able to prohibit each other? (Shang jun\nshu 24: 133; Book of Lord Shang 24.2) \nThis appears to be a rare insight concerning the administrative\nsystem’s fundamental inability to monitor itself in the long\nterm; yet the observation does not lead to any radical alternatives to\nthe system of supervision over officials. The chapter simply reasserts\nthe superiority of techniques and rules over the ruler’s\npersonal intervention in policy-making and does not explain how these\nwould prevent the supervisors’ machinations. Insofar as\ntechniques and rules are implemented by self-interested—or\nsimply erring—human beings, the question remains: to what extent\ncan the impersonal mode of rule cure the intrinsic maladies of the\nbureaucratic system (cf. Van Norden 2013)? This question remains one\nof the major challenges to the Legalists’ legacy. \nNot a few scholars consider Legalists in general and Han Fei in\nparticular as staunch theorists of “monarchic despotism”\n(Hsiao 1979: 386). This evaluation should be qualified, though. What\ndistinguishes Han Fei and his ilk from other thinkers is neither his\ninsistence on the monarchic form of rule as singularly appropriate,\nnor adoration of the sovereign’s authority; actually, on these\npoints the Legalists do not differ from most other intellectual\ncurrents of their age (Pines 2009: 25–107). Rather, their\ndistinctiveness was in their pronounced anti-ministerial stance. This\nstance is exemplified by the following saying of Shen Buhai: \nNow the reason why a ruler builds lofty inner walls and outer walls,\nlooks carefully to the barring of doors and gates, is [to prepare\nagainst] the coming of invaders and bandits. But one who murders the\nruler and takes his state does not necessarily climb over difficult\nwalls and batter in barred doors and gates. [He may be one of the\nministers, who] by limiting what the ruler sees and restricting what\nthe ruler hears, seizes his government and monopolizes his commands,\npossesses his people and takes his state. (Creel 1974: 344,\ntranslation modified) \nThis warning epitomizes what may be considered the major dividing line\nbetween Legalists and their opponents. Despite their pronounced belief\nin monarchic form of rule, most thinkers of the Warring States period\ninsisted that the monarch would never succeed without a worthy aide.\nTheir common desideratum was attaining harmonious relations between\nthe ministers and the rulers; not coincidentally, the common simile of\nthese relations was that of friends, i.e. of equals. Some thinkers\nwere even more assertive in their interpretation of a worthy minister\nas the ruler’s de facto superior, a teacher and not just a\nfriend (Pines 2009: 163–172). One of the most radical\nmanifestations of this pro-ministerial mindset of the Warring States\nera was the idea of abdication, according to which a good ruler may\nconsider yielding the throne to his meritorious aide (Allan 2016;\nPines 2005). For Legalists, in contrast, this very idea proved that\nthe pro-ministerial discourse of their rivals was usurpation in\ndisguise. Ministers should never be trusted: they are neither the\nruler’s friends, nor his teachers, but his bitter foes and\nplotters, who should be checked and controlled rather than cherished\nand empowered. This sober realization—promoted, ironically, by\nthe members of the ministerial stratum—added certain tragic\ndimensions to the Legalists’ political theory. \nLegalists shared the conviction of most other political theorists of\nthe Warring States period: stability and orderly rule in either the\nindividual state or “All-under-Heaven” can be attained\nonly under an omnipotent monarch. They added a few new dimensions to\nthis overarching monarchistic discourse. For instance, in Shang\nYang’s model of state formation, the establishment of the ruler\nis presented—in contrast to Mozi (see the section on Political\nTheory in the entry on\n Mohism)—not\n as a starting point, but as the crowning stage of sociopolitical\nevolution, the final and singularly important step toward stability.\nThe ruler is the only person who represents common interests of the\npolity (gong 公, “commonality,” actually is\nan identical word to “the lord”; cf. Goldin 2013:\n3–4). As such, his power is conceived not as the means of\npersonal enjoyment but as the common interest of his subjects. Shen\nDao elaborates: \nIn antiquity, the Son of Heaven was established and esteemed not in\norder to benefit the single person. It is said: When All under Heaven\nlacks the single esteemed [person], then there is no way to carry out\nthe principles [of orderly government, li 理]….\nHence the Son of Heaven is established for the sake of All under\nHeaven, it is not that All under Heaven is established for the sake of\nthe Son of Heaven…. Even if the law is bad, it is better than\nabsence of laws; thereby the hearts of the people are unified.\n(Shenzi, 16; Harris 2016: 110). \nShen Dao presents his political credo with rare clarity. A ruler is\ncrucial for the proper functioning of the political system; he is the\nreal foundation of political order, not a beneficiary but rather a\nservant of humankind. Significantly, the ruler attains these blessed\nresults by the sheer fact of his existence and not due to his morality\nor intelligence. As Shen Dao clearly states, bad laws are better than\na lawless situation, and we may infer that a bad ruler is better than\nanarchy. What matters—as Shen Dao explains elsewhere—are\nnot the ruler’s individual qualities but his ability to preserve\nhis “positional power” (or “power of\nauthority,” shi 勢). As long as the ruler\npreserves his power intact, i.e., by refraining from delegating it to\nministers and preserving the singularity of decision-making in his own\nhands, the political system will act well. Otherwise, turmoil is\ninevitable. Shen Dao warns: \nWhen the Son of Heaven is established, he should not let the regional\nlords doubt [his position]; when a lord is established, he should not\nlet nobles doubt [his position]; … Doubts bring commotion;\ndoubleness [of the sources of authority] brings contention,\nintermingling brings mutual injury; harm is from sharing, not from\nsingularity (Shenzi, 47–48; Harris 2016: 118). \nShen Buhai echoes Shen Dao: “He who is a singular decision-maker\ncan become the sovereign of All under Heaven” (Creel 1974: 380,\ntranslation modified). \nWhy is the singularity of the ruler’s position so important? It\nis because by the sheer fact of his exclusive authority, the ruler is\nable to arbitrate conflicts among his ministers and to preserve the\nchain of command in his state, without which the state may collapse.\nThis explains also the Legalists’ emphasis on absolute obedience\nto the ruler’s commands, epitomized by the dictum to punish a\nminister who disobeyed commands even if the results of his actions\nwere successful (Guanzi 45: 913; Rickett 1998: 150).\nSimilarly, the above mentioned dictum in Han Feizi to punish\nan over-performing minister may be understood in this context: fear of\na minister’s high ambitions and of his potential disobedience\noutweighs other considerations. The ruler’s exclusivity and\nomnipotence is the sine qua non of proper political order. Preserving\nand strengthening his authority is the Legalists’ declared\npolitical commitment. \nThe Legalists’ strong adherence to the principles of monarchism\nis self-evident; but it is not free of manifold tensions and\ncontradictions. Those are fully epitomized in Han Fei’s thought.\nHan Fei shared his predecessors’ view of the ruler as the pivot\nof sociopolitical order, the sole guarantor of stability and\nprosperity of his subjects; yet he was also bitterly aware of the\nruler’s inadequacy. The very fact that the monarch—unlike\nhis officials—owed his position to pedigree alone meant that\nthis position would more often than not be occupied by a mediocrity.\nMultiple historical examples scattered throughout Han Feizi\nunequivocally demonstrate how devastating the ruler’s ineptitude\ncould be (Graziani 2015). The intrinsic contradiction between an\ninstitutionally infallible and humanly erring sovereign is the major\nsource of tension in the Han Feizi (Pines 2013b). \nThinkers of different ideological inclinations shared the sober\nrealization that a sovereign may be a mediocrity; yet for them this\nproblem was easily resolvable. Insofar as the ruler would be prudent\nenough to entrust everyday affairs to a meritorious aide, he would be\nable to continue enjoying absolute prestige, while practical matters\nwould be decided by worthy ministers (see, e.g., Xunzi 11:\n223–224; Hutton 2014: 112–113). For Han Fei, though, this\nsolution is unacceptable. Time and again he warns the ruler that\nnobody can be trusted: the ruler’s wife, his beloved concubine,\nhis eldest son and heir—all hope for his premature death because\nthis may secure their position. Threats come also from the\nruler’s brothers and cousins, from uncles and bedfellows, from\ndwarfs and clowns who entertain him, from dancers in his court; and,\nof course from the talkative “men-of-service”\n(shi) who conspire with foreign powers to imperil his state.\nEvery single person around the throne should be suspected; and minimal\nnegligence can cost a ruler his life and his power. And the most\ndangerous foes are precisely those whom other thinkers considered the\nruler’s friends and teachers, namely his closest aides, his\nministers. Han Fei compares them to hungry tigers ready to devour the\nsovereign whenever the opportunity arrives: \nThe Yellow Emperor said: “A hundred battles a day are fought\nbetween the superior and his underlings.” The underlings conceal\ntheir private [interests], trying to test their superior; the superior\nemploys norms and measures to restrict the underlings. Hence when\nnorms and measures are established, they are the sovereign’s\ntreasure; when the cliques and cabals are formed, they are the\nminister’s treasure. If the minister does not murder his ruler,\nit is because the cliques and cabals are not formed. (Han\nFeizi 8: 51) \nThis is an amazing saying: the minister is, by his nature, deceitful\nand murderous, and his failure to eliminate the sovereign is simply a\nsign of insufficient preparations, not of unwillingness to do so. The\nministers’ threat to the monarch is inherent in their position,\nand it can be defused only through proper implementation of methods\nand techniques of rule. \nHan Fei’s repeated anti-ministerial philippics perplex the\nreader. It is somewhat ironic that a thinker who actively sought\nemployment in the rulers’ courts presented his own stratum as\nintrinsically malicious. As many traditional and modern scholars\nnoticed, Han Fei’s personal tragedy—he was slandered at\nthe court of Qin, imprisoned and reportedly forced to commit suicide\nbefore being able to present his views to the King of Qin—was a\nby-product of the very atmosphere of the ruler-minister mistrust that\nthe thinker himself generated. But going beyond this personal tragedy\nthere is a more general question: how can the ruler maintain his\nfunctions in the situation of permanent danger and absolute mistrust\nbetween him and his aides? \nHan Fei’s immediate answer is that the ruler should protect\nhimself through careful employment of the techniques of government\ndepicted above. He should check his ministers’ reports,\ninvestigate their performance, promote or demote them according to the\nmatch between “performance” and the “name”; he\nshould remain calm and secretive and let them expose themselves; he\nshould encourage mutual spying and denouncement among his ministers.\nBut this supposedly neat solution is problematic. First, it requires\nat times superhuman intellectual abilities of the ruler, in direct\ncontradiction to Han Fei’s own insistence that his system fits\nan “average” (i.e., mediocre) sovereign (Han\nFeizi 40: 392). Second, it remains unclear how the ruler will\ngain access to reliable information if each of his close\naides—as Han Fei reminds him—is a potential cheater\n(Han Feizi 6: 36–37). And third, a system which\nrequires permanent surveillance of everybody can easily fall into a\ntrap of totalitarian regimes in which “each agent charged with\ninspecting and controlling must logically be subject to inspection and\ncontrol himself” (Graziani 2015: 175). Han Fei’s\nclear-sightedness with regard to ministerial machinations is\nremarkable, but it eventually entraps the sovereign in the nightmarish\nsituation of comprehensive suspicion and mistrust. \nYet scheming ministers aside, the sovereign should beware of his own\nmistakes, which may be even worse than his foes’ plans. The\nmonarch is the most revered individual, but also the weakest chain in\nthe government apparatus. He can be duped by his underlings, is prone\nto misjudge them, and his actions may frequently endanger the very\nfoundations of political order that he is supposed to safeguard.\nHence, the thinker repeatedly urges the ruler to refrain from any\npersonal activities, any reliance on personal knowledge, and any\nmanifestation of personal likes and dislikes. “He who relies on\npersonal abilities is the worst ruler”; “When the\nsovereign abandons the law and behaves selfishly, there is no\ndifference between the rulers and the ruled”; “When the\nruler has selfish kindness, the ruled have selfish desires”\n(Han Feizi 48: 432; 6: 32; 45: 414 et saepe). The\nruler should refrain from any action; echoing the Laozi\n老子, Han Fei urges him to remain empty and tranquil\n(Han Feizi 5: 27). The thinker summarizes his\nrecommendations: \nThe ruler does not reveal his desires; should he do so, the minister\nwill carve and embellish them. He does not reveal his views; should he\ndo so, the minister will use them to present his different [opinion].\n… The way of the enlightened sovereign is to let the\nknowledgeable completely exhaust their contemplations—then the\nruler relies on them to decide on matters and is not depleted of\nknowledge; to let the worthy utilize their talents—then the\nruler relies on them, assigns tasks, and is not depleted of abilities.\nWhen there is success, the ruler possesses a worthy [name]; when there\nis failure, the minister bears the responsibility. (Han Feizi\n5: 27) \nThis is a curious recommendation: the ruler should completely nullify\nhimself both in order to preserve his authority against scheming\nministers, and to acquire—unjustly!—a good name at the\nminister’s expense. Yet this sovereign, who has neither desires\nnor observable views, becomes the ultimate slave of his office. For\nthe sake of self-preservation he must abolish his personality, being\ncompletely submerged by the system which he ostensibly runs. A.C.\nGraham provocatively notices that the ruler in Han Fei’s system\n“has no functions which could not be performed by an elementary\ncomputer. … Might one even say than in Han Fei’s system\nit is ministers who do the ruling?” (Graham 1989: 291). This\nparadox of an entrapped sovereign, who enjoys God-like omnipotence,\nbut who is required to refrain from any activism in order to preserve\nthis omnipotence is one of the most fascinating manifestations of the\nintrinsic contradiction of the authoritarian system. When it comes\nfrom a thinker who is often described as singularly\nauthoritarian-minded, it deserves utmost attention. \nIn the twentieth century not a few scholars dubbed Legalists\n“totalitarians” (e.g., Creel 1953: 135–158; Rubin\n1976: 55–88; Fu Zhengyuan 1996). Some of the aspects of the\nLegalist program—a powerful state that overwhelms society, rigid\ncontrol over the populace and the administrative apparatus, harsh\nlaws, and the like—seem to lend support to this equation. Yet\nwhen we move to the realm of thought control—a sine qua non for\na true totalitarian polity—the results are somewhat equivocal.\nAlthough Shang Yang and Han Fei have much to say on matters of culture\nand learning, their message is predominantly negative: they eagerly\nexpose the fallacies of their opponents’ views, but do not\nnecessarily provide an ideological alternative of their own. \nShang Yang is particularly notorious for his comprehensive assault on\ntraditional culture and on moral values. The Book of Lord\nShang abounds with controversial and highly provocative\nstatements like this one: \nPoems, Documents, rites, music, goodness,\nself-cultivation, benevolence, uprightness, argumentativeness,\ncleverness: when the state has these ten, superiors cannot induce [the\npeople] to [engage in] defense and fighting. If the state is ruled\naccording to these ten, then if the enemy arrives it will surely be\ndismembered, and if the enemy does not arrive, the state will surely\nbe impoverished. If the state eradicates these ten, then the enemy\nwill not dare arrive, and even if he arrives, he will surely be\nrepelled; when an army is raised and sent on a campaign, it will\nsurely seize [the enemy’s land]; whereas if the army is\nrestrained and does not attack, the state will surely be rich.\n(Shang jun shu 3: 23; Book of Lord Shang 3.5) \nThis and similar pronouncements, as well as the text’s derisive\nlanguage (it dubs moral values as “parasites” or\n“lice” 蝨), explain why Shang Yang gained notoriety\nin the eyes of imperial literati, as well as many modern scholars, as\nan enemy of morality. Yet this conclusion should be qualified. The\n“alienating rhetoric,” an example of which is cited above,\nis concentrated only in a few chapters of the Book of Lord\nShang; most other display more accommodative views toward\ntraditional moral values; some even promise that “the sage\nruler” would be able to “implement benevolence and\nrighteousness in All under Heaven” (Shang jun shu 13:\n82; Book of Lord Shang 13.6; see also detailed discussion in\nPines 2012). It seems that the text assaults not morality as such but\nrather moralizing discourse. It is this discourse—or more\nprecisely its bearers, the peripatetic “men of service”\nwho seek employment at the rulers’ courts—which arouse\nShang Yang’s indignation. \nShang Yang deplores traveling intellectuals because they damage the\nfoundations of his sociopolitical model. By gaining official positions\nand emoluments outside the carefully designed system of ranks of\nmerit, they undermine the people’s commitment to agriculture and\nwarfare: \nWhen one thousand people are engaged in agriculture and warfare, yet\nthere is a single man among them engaged in Poems,\nDocuments, argumentativeness and cleverness, then one\nthousand people all will become remiss in agriculture and warfare.\n… This is the teaching that impoverishes the state and weakens\nthe army. (Shang jun shu 3:22–26; Book of Lord\nShang 3.5–3.10) \nIt is worth noticing that Shang Yang’s dislike of traveling\npersuaders is less related to the content of their doctrines but\nrather focuses on their negative impact on the people’s\nmores. The very fact that talkative intellectuals are being\npromoted distracts the people from substantial occupations and causes\nthem engagement in hollow talk and needless learning. Moreover,\nintellectuals, with their sophisticated ideas, destroy the\npeople’s simple-mindedness (pu 樸), making the\nlatter less diligent and more difficult to control. Thus, both\neconomically and politically, learning is harmful: it distracts the\npeople from their diligent work and diminishes their\nsubmissiveness. \nThis said, the Book of Lord Shang does speak at times of\n“teaching” or “indoctrination” (jiao\n教). Yet normally, this term refers not to imposition of a new\nset of values, but rather to the internalization of the\ngovernment’s regulations, which would allow the people to comply\nwith the government’s requirements without the need in coercion\n(cf. Sanft 2014). In a major discussion of jiao, the text\nsays: \nWhat is called “unification of teaching” is that …\nfathers and elder brothers, minor brothers, acquaintances, relatives\nby marriage, and colleagues all say: “What we should be devoted\nto is just war and that is all.” … This is what I, your\nminister, call “unification of teaching.” … The\npeople’s desire for riches and nobility stops only when their\ncoffin is sealed. And [entering] the gates of riches and nobility must\nbe through military [service]. Therefore, when they hear about war,\nthe people congratulate each other; whenever they move or rest, drink\nor eat, they sing and chant only about war. (Shang jun shu\n17: 105; Book of Lord Shang 17.4) \nTeaching the people to “sing and chant only about war”\ncould easily refer to military indoctrination, such as we encounter in\nother countries that employed mass armies. Yet the Book of Lord\nShang never speaks of, e.g., adoration of martial spirit,\ndehumanization of the enemy, identifying martiality with masculinity,\nand similar devices employed in militaristic education elsewhere.\nRather, for Shang Yang and other contributors to “his”\nbook “teaching” means simply the people’s\ninternalization of the fact that the only way to satisfy their desires\nfor riches and glory is to excel in war. Hence war, which elsewhere in\nthe book is frankly associated with what the people hate (Shang\njun shu 18: 108; Book of Lord Shang 18.2), becomes the\nfocus of the people’s aspirations. “Teaching” is\nthen not about ideological indoctrination; it is just about willful\ncompliance with the government’s policies. \nHan Fei’s views of traditional culture and of learning echo\nShang Yang’s, but he is even more vehement in his dislike of\ntraveling scholars who rise up the sociopolitical ladder by selling\ntheir ideas to the rulers and to high ministers. He repeatedly\nridicules rulers who are fond of argumentativeness and of crafty\nwords: they employ proponents of mutually exclusive doctrines just out\nof admiration of their rhetorical skills, and without any\nconsideration of the doctrines’ political worth. Han Fei\nadvises: \nNow, when the ruler listens to [a certain] teaching, if he approves of\nits doctrine, he should promulgate it among the officials and employ\nits adherents; if he disapproves of its doctrine, he should dismiss\nits adherents and cut it off. (Han Feizi 50: 459) \nThis proposal amounts to “nationalization” of intellectual\nactivity. Han Fei does not deny in principle that some of the rival\ndoctrines may benefit the state; he just denies their proponents the\nright to develop and elaborate their views independently of the state.\nHan Fei leaves his rivals no illusions: intellectuals can pursue their\nideas only insofar as they are part of the state-ordained system of\npower, otherwise their ideas will be “cut off.” Elsewhere,\nhe concludes: \nAccordingly, in the country of an enlightened ruler there are no texts\nwritten in books and on bamboo strips, but the law is the teaching;\nthere are no “speeches” of the former kings, but officials\nare the teachers; there is no private wielding of swords, but\nbeheading [enemies] is valor. (Han Feizi 49: 452) \nHan Fei’s suggestion to eliminate “texts written in books\nand on bamboo strips” and to turn officials into teachers was\nimplemented by his fellow student and nemesis, Li Si, soon after the\nimperial unification of 221 BCE. In 213 BCE, after heated court\ndebates, Li Si launched a comprehensive assault on “private\nlearning,” which he identified as intellectually divisive and\npolitically subversive. He then suggested eliminating copies of the\ncanonical books of Poems and Documents, as well as\nSpeeches of the Hundred Schools [of thought] from private\ncollections, leaving copies only in the possession of the court\nerudites (bo shi 博士). Li Si concluded his\nproposal by echoing Han Fei’s views: “And those who want\nto study laws and ordinances, let them take an official as a\nteacher!” (Shiji 87: 2546; Watson 1993: 185). \nLi Si’s assault on private learning is often misinterpreted as\nthe victory of “Legalist” over “Confucian”\nideology, but this is wrong. Confucianism as such was not targeted;\nactually, it prospered among the court erudites (Kern 2000:\n188–191). What mattered to Li Si—as to Han Fei—was\nnot doctrinal unity as such, but the imposition of the state control\nover intellectual life, as in all other spheres of social activity.\nIntellectuals were not persecuted because of the content of their\nideas; but they were required either to enter government service or to\nquit their pursuits. Eventually, Li Si’s biblioclasm backfired.\nIt caused not only considerable resentment in the short term, but,\nmore ominously, brought about immense dislike of Qin—and of\nLegalism—among the overwhelming majority of the imperial\nliterati for millennia to come (Pines 2014a). \nQin unification of 221 BCE could have become the triumph of Legalism.\nThe rise of the state of Qin started with Shang Yang; and it was by\nfollowing his “agriculture cum warfare” course of action\nthat this state became rich and powerful enough to subdue its\nformidable enemies. Many aspects of Qin’s policy before the\nimperial unification and in its aftermath—such as the creation\nof an intrusive government apparatus, tight supervision over\nofficials, reliance on impartial laws and regulations, and the\nlike—were designed by Shang Yang, Shen Buhai, Han Fei, and their\nlike. And these policies brought about unprecedented success: after\nfive centuries of unending warfare, the entire realm “under\nHeaven” was unified under a single ruler! Proud of his success,\nthe First Emperor (emp. 221–210 BCE) toured his newly acquired\nempire, erecting stone steles on the sites of sacred mountains. In the\nstele inscriptions he boasted of bringing unity, peace, stability, and\norderly rule (Kern 2000; Pines 2014b). Dreams of generations of\npreimperial thinkers were realized, and this was done primarily\nthrough following the recipes of those whom we dub today\n“Legalists.” \nYet history was cruel to the Legalists. The Qin dynasty (221–207\nBCE), which was designed to rule for “myriad generations”\n(Shiji 6: 236), collapsed shortly after the founder’s\ndeath, brought down by a popular rebellion of unprecedented scope and\nferocity. This swift collapse—which took place just a few years\nafter Li Si’s infamous biblioclasm—shaped the image of Qin\nfor millennia to come. The dynasty was no longer a success story, but\nrather that of miserable failure; and the ideas which guided its\npolicymakers were discredited as well. Already in the first\ngenerations after the Qin, consensus was reached: its collapse was due\nto excessive activism, abnormal assertiveness of its administrative\napparatus, over-reliance on penalties, senseless expansionism, and\ndebilitating mistrust between the emperors and their entourage (Jia Yi\n賈誼 [200–168 BCE] as cited in Shiji 6:\n276–284; Xin yu 4: 62). All these policies could be\nmeaningfully attributed to the Legalists, whose intellectual legacy\nwas as a result discredited. At best it was reduced to Sima\nTan’s assessment: “a one-time policy that could not be\nconstantly applied.” \nThe diminishing appeal of Legalism became fully visible under the\nreign of Emperor Wu of the Han (r. 141–87 BCE). Although the\nEmperor himself adopted assertive domestic and foreign policies\nlargely patterned after the Qin dynasty, he considered it prudent to\ndistance himself from the Qin and Legalism, and to\nendorse—however superficially—Confucianism. It was during\nhis reign that first proposals were made to ban the followers of Shang\nYang, Shen Buhai, and Han Fei from holding office. Although in the\nshort term these proposals had limited consequences (Shang\nYang’s legacy was still openly defended by the government\nrepresentative during the court debates in 81 BCE), in the long term\nthe attitude toward Legalists changed. Few scholars studied their\nwritings; even fewer were courageous enough to endorse their legacy\nopenly. Much like Qin itself (for which see Pines 2014a), Legalism\nhenceforth became a negative label, associated with the policies\nimmensely opposed by the majority of imperial literati: excessive\nharshness, oppression, terror at court, imperial hubris, and the like.\nSelf-identification as a follower of Shang Yang or Han Fei became a\nrarity, if not an impossibility. \nIn imperial times, the position of Legalism was somewhat paradoxical.\nOn the one hand, its ideas remained highly influential, especially in\nthe realm of administrative practice, but also with regard to the\npolicies of the enrichment and empowerment of the state, as well as in\nsome legal practices. On certain occasions, some of the leading\nimperial reformers—from Zhuge Liang 諸葛亮\n(181–234) to Su Chuo 蘇綽 (498–546), from Wang\nAnshi 王安石 (1021–1086) to Zhang Juzheng\n張居正 (1525–1582)—could openly\nacknowledge their indebtedness to the Legalist ways of reinvigorating\nthe government apparatus and restoring the state’s economic and\nmilitary prowess. On the other hand, most political reformers and\nactivists remained closet Legalists at best. For the vast majority of\nthe literati, Shang Yang, Han Fei, and their like were negative\nexamples; hence, most of the texts associated with the Legalist school\nceased circulating, and only a very few merited commentaries. Overt\nendorsement of Shang Yang, for instance, would be all but impossible\nfor a respected man of letters. \nIt was only at the turn of the twentieth century that Legalism was\nrediscovered and partly rehabilitated by the new generations of\nintellectuals. Frustrated by China’s inability to reconstitute\nitself in a modern world as a “powerful state with a strong\narmy,” young intellectuals began searching for a variety of\nnon-traditional responses to domestic and external challenges; among\nthese, some turned toward Legalism. It was deemed relevant not only\nbecause it had demonstrable practical achievements in the past, but\nalso because of its innovativeness, willingness to depart from the\npatterns of the past, and even its quasi-scientific outlook. For\ninstance, the first major promulgator of interest in Shang\nYang’s thought, Mai Menghua 麥夢華\n(1874–1915), was positively attracted by the surprising\nsimilarity between Shang Yang’s views of history and\nevolutionary ideas of Occidental social theorists; and he further\nidentified in the Book of Lord Shang parallels to the Western\nideas of imperialism, nationalism, statism (guojiazhuyi\n國家主義), and even the rule of law (Li Yu-ning 1977: lviii-lix).\nEven such a major liberal thinker as Hu Shi 胡適\n(1891–1962) was willing to forgive the Legalists their notorious\nharshness and oppressiveness, hailing Han Fei and Li Si for their\n“brave spirit of opposing those who ‘do not make the\npresent into their teacher but learn from the past’” (Hu\nShi 1930: 6.480–81). Slightly later, it was no less a figure\nthan Hu Hanmin 胡漢民 (1879–1936), one of the\nmost eminent Guomindang 國民黨 (Kuomintang, KMT,\n“Party of the Nation”) leaders, who wrote a preface to a\nnew edition of the Book of Lord Shang (Hu Hanmin 1933). \nThe endorsement of Legalism peaked under Mao Zedong\n毛澤東 (1893–1976). Mao’s intellectual\nactivism started, incidentally, with a high-school essay written in\npraise of Shang Yang (Schram 1992–2004, Vol. 1: 5–6), and\nhis positive view of Shang Yang and of the Qin dynasty strengthened as\ntime passed. In the last years of Mao’s life, under the infamous\n“anti-Confucian” campaign, Legalism was openly endorsed\nand hailed as “progressive” intellectual current both in\nits outlook and its historical role (Li Yu-ning 1977); attempts were\neven made to position it as a direct predecessor of Mao Zedong’s\nThought (see, e.g., Liu Zehua 2012). \nAfter Mao’s death, this grotesque politicization of Legalism\ndiscontinued. While in the 1980s Legalism still could surface in\nChina’s intellectual debates about paths that the country needed\nto take, and while echoes of Chinese polemics could be heard in the\nWest as recently as the 1990s (Fu Zhengyuan 1996), this “usage\nof the past to criticize the present” gradually receded (Pines\nand Defoort 2016). With it, studies of Legalist thought receded as\nwell, especially in the West and in Japan, but to a certain extent\nalso in China. Most recently, this trend is changing, and the academic\ncommunity is rediscovering the richness of Legalist thought. Without\nexcessive endorsement or disparagement, scholars can investigate this\nset of ideas, which was highly effective in the context of the Warring\nStates period, but proved less applicable to other historical\ncircumstances.","contact.mail":"pinesy@mscc.huji.ac.il","contact.domain":"mscc.huji.ac.il"}]
