The second\ndeals with the problem of whether mathematical explanations occur\nwithin mathematics itself. Accordingly, this entry surveys the\ncontributions to both areas, it shows their relevance to the history\nof philosophy, mathematics, and science, it articulates their\nconnection, and points to the philosophical pay-offs to be expected by\ndeepening our understanding of the topic.\n\n\nMathematics plays a central role in our scientific picture of the\nworld. How the connection between mathematics and the world is to be\naccounted for remains one of the most challenging problems in\nphilosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics, and general\nphilosophy. A very important aspect of this problem is that of\naccounting for the explanatory role mathematics seems to play in the\naccount of physical phenomena. \nConsider the following example from evolutionary biology introduced in\nBaker 2005 and discussed extensively in the philosophical\nliterature. It has to do with the life-cycle of the so-called\n‘periodical’ cicada. It turns out that three species of\nsuch cicadas: \nSeveral questions have been raised about this specific type of life\ncycle but one of them is why such periods are prime. One explanation\nappeals to the biological claim that cicadas that minimize\nintersection with other cicadas’ and predators’ life cycles have an\nevolutionary advantage over those that do not. The mathematical\ncomponent of the explanation complements the biological claim by\npointing out that prime periods minimize intersection. \nWhen we move to physics, it becomes even more difficult—given\nthe highly mathematized nature of the subject—to distinguish\nbetween the mathematical and the physical components of an\nexplanation.  Consider the following example. Mark the faces of a\ntennis racket with\nR (for rough) and S (for smooth). Hold the tennis\nracket horizontally by its handle with face S facing\nup. Let y be the intermediate principal axis. This is the\nvertical axis perpendicular to the handle and passing through the\ncenter of mass of the racquet. Toss the racket attempting to make it\nrotate about the y axis. Catch the racket by its handle after\none full rotation. The surprising observation is that the\nR face will almost always be up (one would expect S\nto be up). In other words, the racket makes a half twist about its\nhandle. An explanation of this phenomenon was given in Ashbaugh,\nChicone, & Cushman 1991.  They say: “In this paper we\nexplain the twist by analyzing the [differential] equations of motion\nof the tennis racket in space…Our treatment of the twist is\ndivided into two parts. In the first part we prove two theorems which\nshow that the handle moves nearly in a plane and rotates nearly\nuniformly…In the second part, we discuss how the twist and\nrotation of the handle are related” (Ashbaugh & others 1991,\n68). There is no question that we are explaining a physical regularity\nbut mathematics enters here both in the modeling of the phenomenon and\nin the explanatory account by means of the classical dynamics of a\nrotating tennis racket. \n\nAnother simple example, in which a geometrical fact seems to do much\nof the explaining, has been offered by Peter Lipton: \nWhile not everyone agrees as to the role of mathematics in the above\nexplanations, or whether they are explanations, it is clear that one\nof the reasons why philosophers are especially interested in such\nexplanations is that they appear to be counterexamples to the claim\nthat all explanations in the natural sciences must be causal. The\ndominant accounts of scientific explanation (see Salmon 1984,\nCartwright 1989, Woodward 2003, Strevens 2008, and Woodward 2014 for\nan overview) in the natural sciences have been causal accounts: to\nprovide an explanation of a scientific fact is to provide its cause or\nthe mechanism yielding the fact (on mechanistic explanations see\nWoodward 2013, Andersen 2014, and Craver and Tabery 2016).  The last\ntwo decades has witnessed major contributions in the study of\nnon-causal explanations in the sciences (for a recent volume devoted\nto the issue see Reutlinger & Saatsi 2018). And since many of the\nnon-causal explanations that have been discussed in the literature are\nmathematical explanations, this area of philosophy of science is\nfueled by concerns related to the nature of scientific\nexplanation.  \nIn addition to the examples given above and several others to be\nmentioned below, other cases of explanation that have been extensively\ndiscussed include the FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction of bodies in\nspecial relativity (Colyvan 2001, 2002), the impossibility of crossing\nall the Königsberg bridges passing only once on any single bridge\n(Pincock 2007), the hexagonal shape of honeycomb cells (Lyon and\nColyvan 2008), Plateau’s soap films (Lyon 2012, Pincock 2015a), and\nthe location of the Kirkwood gaps (Colyvan 2010).  \nImportantly related is the issue of mathematical modeling and of\nwhether an explanatory modeling of a scientific phenomenon needs to\nprovide a veridical representation of the salient causes (or of a\ncausal mechanism) in the target phenomenon. Many philosophers who\ndefend the causal theory of explanation also defend a (veridical)\ncausal conception of modeling but many challenges have been raised\nagainst the latter conception. For instance, endorsing the conclusions\nof Batterman’s work (see section 3) Rice claims: \nThe topic interacts also with the problem of characterizing the role\nof idealization in science. As we shall see, alleged counterexamples\nto the causal theory of explanation as well as to the causal theory of\nmodeling come from areas as diverse as mathematics, physics, biology,\nand economics. \n\nHaving established that mathematics seems to play an important role\nin giving explanations in the natural sciences, we now move to a few\nhistorical remarks on how this problem has emerged in the history of\nphilosophy and science. \n\nDoes mathematics help explain the physical world or does it actually\nhinder a grasp of the physical mechanisms that explain the how and why\nof natural phenomena? It is not possible here to treat this topic in\nits full complexity but a few remarks will help the reader appreciate\nthe historical importance of the question. \nAristotle describes his ideal of scientific knowledge in\n“Posterior Analytics” in terms of, among other things,\nknowledge of the cause: \n\nThe causes [aitia] in question are the four Aristotelian causes:\nformal, material, efficient, and final. Nowadays, translators and\ncommentators of Aristotle prefer to translate aitia as\n‘explanation’, so that the theory of the four causes\nbecomes an account of four types of explanations. For instance here is\nBarnes’ translation of the passage quoted earlier: “We\nthink we understand a thing simpliciter (and not in the sophistic\nfashion accidentally) whenever we think we are aware both that the\nexplanation because of which the object is is its explanation, and that\nit is not possible for this to be otherwise.” (Aristotle CWA,\n115, Post. An. I.1, 71b 5–10) \n\nBut how do we obtain scientific knowledge? Scientific knowledge is obtained through\ndemonstration. However, not all logically cogent proofs provide us with\nthe kind of demonstration that yields scientific knowledge. In a\nscientific demonstration “the premisses must be true, primary,\nimmediate, better known and prior to the conclusion, which is further\nrelated to them as effect to causes.” (BWA, 112, Post. An. I.1,\n71b 20–25) In Barnes’ translation: “If, then, understanding\nis as we posited, it is necessary for demonstrative understanding in\nparticular to depend on things which are true and primitive and\nimmediate and more familiar than and prior to and explanatory of the\nconclusion” (Aristotle CWA, 115, Post. An. I.1, 71b 20–25). \n\nAccordingly, in “Posterior Analytics” I.13, Aristotle\ndistinguished between demonstrations “of the fact” and\ndemonstrations “of the reasoned fact”. Although both are\nlogically cogent only the latter mirror the causal structure of the\nphenomena under investigation, and thus provide us with knowledge. We\ncan call them, respectively, “non-explanatory” and\n“explanatory” demonstrations. \nIn Aristotle’s system, physics was not mathematized although\ncausal reasonings were proper to it. However, Aristotle also discussed\nextensively the so-called mixed sciences, such as optics, harmonics,\nand mechanics, characterizing them as “the more physical of the\nmathematical sciences”. There is a relation of subordination\nbetween these mixed sciences and areas of pure mathematics. For\ninstance, harmonics is subordinated to arithmetic and optics to\ngeometry. Aristotle is in no doubt that there are mathematical\nexplanations of physical phenomena: \n\nHowever, the topic of whether mathematics could give explanations of\nnatural phenomena was one on which there was disagreement. As the\ndomains to which mathematics could be applied grew, so also did the\nresistance to it. One source of tension consisted in trying to\nreconcile the Aristotelian conception of pure mathematics, as\nabstracting from matter and motion, with the fact that both physics\n(natural philosophy) and the mixed sciences are all conversant about\nnatural phenomena and thus dependent on matter and motion. For\ninstance, an important debate in the Renaissance, known as the Quaestio\nde Certitudine Mathematicarum, focused in large part on whether\nmathematics could play the explanatory role assigned to it by\nAristotle. Some argued that lacking causality, mathematics could not be\nthe ‘explanatory’ link in the explanation of natural\nphenomena (see also section 5). \n\nBy the time we reach the seventeenth century and the Newtonian\nrevolution in physics, the problem reappears in the context of a change\nof criteria of explanation and intelligibility. This has been\nbeautifully described in an article by Y. Gingras (2001). Gingras\nargues that “the use of mathematics in dynamics (as distinct from\nits use in kinematics) had the effect of transforming the very meaning\nof the term ‘explanation’ as it was used by philosophers in\nthe seventeenth century” (385). What Gingras describes, among\nother things, is how the mathematical treatment of force espoused by\nNewton and his followers—a treatment that ignored the\nmechanisms that could explain why and how this force\noperated—became an accepted standard for explanation during the\neighteenth century. After referring to the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies’ discussions on the mechanical explanation of gravity, he\nremarks: \n\nAmong those who resisted this confusion between “physical\nexplanations” and “mathematical explanations” was\nthe Jesuit Louis Castel. In “Vrai système de physique\ngénérale de M. Isaac Newton” (Paris, 1734), he\ndiscussed Principia’s proposition XIII of Book III (on Kepler’s law of\nareas). He granted that the proposition connected mathematically the\ninverse square law to the ellipticity of the course of the\nplanets. However, he objected that “the one is not the cause,\nthe reason of the other” (Castel 1734, 97) and that Newton had\nnot provided any physical explanation, only a mathematical one. Indeed\n“physical reasons are necessary reasons of entailment, of\nlinkages, of mechanism. In Newton, there is none of this\nkind.” (Castel 1734, 121) \nIt would be interesting to pursue these questions into the nineteenth\nand the twentieth centuries but that is obviously not something that\ncan be done here (see however Dorato 2017 for a wide-ranging claim\nconcerning “explanatory switches” at crucial junctions in\nthe history of physics). Rather, the aim of the above was to prepare\nthe ground for showing how in contemporary discussions in philosophy\nof science, to which we now turn, we are still confronted with such\nissues. \nThere are two major areas in which the discussion of whether\nmathematics can play an explanatory role in science makes itself felt.\nThe first concerns issues of modeling and idealization in science and\nmore generally, as pointed out in section 1, the nature of scientific\nexplanation. The second, concerns the nominalism-platonism debate. By\nand large the former area is a major concern to philosophers of\nscience. The latter is the preoccupation of those philosophers of\nmathematics primarily concerned with issues of existence of\nmathematical entities. There are however non-trivial intersections\nbetween the two areas. These are surveyed in the next two sub-sections. \n\nA good starting point here is Morrison’s book “Unifying\nScientific Theories” (2000). One of the major theses of the book\nis that unification and explanation often pull in different directions\nand come apart (contrary to what is claimed by unification theories of\nexplanation). One of the examples discussed in her introduction reminds\nus of Castel’s objections: \n\nUsing several case studies (Maxwell’s electromagnetism, the\nelectroweak unification, etc.), Morrison argues that the mathematical\nstructures involved in the unification “often supply little or no\ntheoretical explanation of the physical dynamics of the unified\ntheory” (Morrison 2000, 4). In short, the mathematical formalism\nfacilitates unification but does not help us explain the how and why of\nphysical phenomena.  \n\nBy contrast, Batterman in “The Devil in the Details”\n(2002), analyzes a wide class of explanations—asymptotic\nexplanations—which heavily rely on\nmathematics. “Asymptotic reasoning—the taking of limits as\na means to simplify, and the study of the nature of these\nlimits—constitutes the main method of idealization in the\nmathematician’s tool box” (Batterman 2002, 132). These methods\nproceed by ignoring many details, even of a causal nature, about the\nphenomenon being analyzed (one speaks of minimal models in this\nconnection). But despite this fact, nay, in virtue of it, one arrives\nat correct explanations of the phenomena. In fact, the reason why\n“asymptotic analyses so often provide physical insight is that\nthey illuminate structurally stable aspects of the phenomenon and its\ngoverning equations.” (Batterman 2002, 59). \nBatterman offers examples from, among other areas, statistical\nmechanics, thermodynamics, optics, hydrodynamics, and quantum\nmechanics. In addition to his book, he developed his position in\nseveral articles (2005, 2009, 2010a, 2010b, 2011). See also Pincock\n2011b for a detailed working out of the mathematical explanation of\nthe rainbow that extends this approach.  \nReactions to Batterman’s position include Redhead 2004, Belot 2005,\nNorton 2012, Pincock 2011a and 2012, Strevens 2008, Wayne 2011, 2012,\nand Bueno and French 2012. Objections range from claiming that\nasymptotic idealization are not needed to explain the target\nphenomenon to claiming that the “emergent qualitative\nfeatures” that Batterman claims are yielded by asymptotic\nidealizations are not even genuine targets of explanation (this second\naspect is connected to more general debates on emergence in\nphysics). Strevens 2017 articulates, contra Norton 2012, what he takes\nto be the novel features of Batterman’s asymptotic (infinitary)\nidealizations that distinguish them from other non-infinitary\nidealizations (frictionless planes and ideal gases). He does so by\nappealing to cases from population genetics where one postulates\n“infinite populations”. \nWe thus see that the problem of the explanatory role of mathematics in\nscience is intimately related to problems of modeling and idealization\nin science (see Morrison 2015). In turn, understanding how modeling\nand idealization work is an integral part of addressing the question\nof how mathematics hooks on to reality, i.e. an account of the\napplicability of mathematics to reality (see Shapiro 2000, 35 and\n217). It would of course be impossible here to describe the major\naccounts of mathematical applications on offer. However, the\ndiscussion on mathematical explanation in the empirical sciences has\nfruitfully interacted with some of the proposals on offer. One such\nproposal is the mapping account of mathematical applications offered\nby Pincock (2007, 2011c, 2012). The mapping account emphasizes the\ncentrality of the existence of a mapping between the mathematical\nstructures and the empirical reality that is the target of the\nscientific modeling. Critics have claimed that while there are aspects\nof the applications of mathematics that are correctly captured by the\nmapping account, there are also aspects related to mathematical\nidealization and explanation that it does not manage to capture. This\nled to the inferential conception of applications of mathematics\ndefended by Bueno and Colyvan 2011 (which preserves some of the\nmapping account defended by Pincock) and to refinements of Batterman’s\nown position (see, for instance, Batterman 2010a). Pincock 2011a and\n2012 replies to some of the criticisms and argues that his account can\nbe extended to handle mathematical idealizations and\nexplanations. More criticisms are raised in Rizza 2013 who argues that\nexamples from social choice theory cannot be handled by mapping\naccounts such as those defended by Pincock and Bueno and Colyvan. \nPincock’s position is classified in Batterman and Rice 2014 as sharing\nwith many others (including those based on causal theories of\nexplanation and those based on mechanistic explanations cited in\nsection 1) a representational bias. Batterman and Rice offer instead\nexamples of explanations in which models can be explanatory even when\nthere are no “common features” (a mirroring relation of\nsorts) between the model and the phenomena being explained. They claim\nthat one such case is the case of lattice gas automaton models of\nfluid dynamics: these minimal models are said to account for the\nuniversal behavior of some fluids while also failing to represent any\nof the relevant microphysics of actual fluids. Batterman and Rice note\nthat these explanations can be understood using renormalization group\ntechniques. These minimal models are also extensively used in biology\n(Fisher’s model of one-to-one sex ratios). Batterman and Rice\nconclude: \nOne should point out that the terminology of minimal model is also\nused in a different sense in the literature, for instance in Weisberg\n2007 and Strevens 2008; in this second use, minimal models provide\nessential causal details. Chirimuuta 2014 distinguishes B-minimal\nmodels (of the Batterman type) and A-minimal models (of the\nWeisberg-Strevens type). Chirimuuta herself defines a class of minimal\nmodels (I-minimal models) that “figure prominently in\nexplanations of why a particular neural system exhibits a particular\nempirically observed behaviour, by referring to its computational\nfunction.” (2014, p. 144) \nRice 2015 (see also 2012) focuses on optimality models, which are\nwidely used in physics, biology and economics. He argues that these\nmodels explain without tracking any genuine causal structure in the\ntarget phenomenon. Such models give rise to “optimization\nexplanations”. Baron 2014 considers a case of mathematical\nexplanation in science concerning search patterns of fully-aquatic\nmarine predators and argues that mathematical explanations in science\nare rather common on account of the widespread use of optimality\nmodels of statistical nature (such as Lévy walks displayed in\nthe search patterns mentioned above). Baron 2016b also discusses the\nexample in connection to the role idealizations play in such\nexplanations (see also Potochnik 2007). \nWhile Batterman and Rice claim that explanations that depend on\nrenormalization group techniques are not causal, Reutlinger 2014\ninsists that causal factors are still present. But Reutlinger also\nadmits that non-causal factors are crucial due to the role of\nmathematical operations. He thus links these cases to Lange’s class of\ndistinctively mathematical explanations (Lange 2013c, see below). For\nmore on renormalization techniques and mathematical explanation see\nBatterman 2010b, Reutlinger 2014, 2017a and 2017b, Povich 2016, and\nMorrison 2018. \nMinimal models are also discussed in Chirimuuta 2014, Lange 2015a, and\nPovich 2016. Lange raises several objections to Batterman and Rice’s\naccount of how minimal models work and to why the “common\nfeatures” approach fails to account for such\nexplanations. Povich defends a “common features”\napproach. Pincock and Batterman are criticized in Reutlinger and\nAndersen 2016 on account of relying on the assumption that abstract\nexplanations, defined as those that leave out most of the\nmicrophysical causal details of the target phenomenon to be explained,\nhave to be non-causal. They claim, by contrast, that a) abstract\nexplanations often do identify causes and b) that they often are\ncausally explanatory. Andersen 2106, which aims to provide a friendly\namendment to Lange 2013c, sees complementarity and not opposition\nbetween causal and mathematical explanations. \nOther examples of non-causal explanations include dimensional\nexplanations (Lange 2009, Pexton 2014), graph-theoretic explanations\nof empirical facts (Pincock 2007, 2012, Lange 2013c), kinematic\nexplanations in physics (Saatsi 2018), explanations given in terms of\nsymmetry principles and conservation laws (Lange 2007, 2013a, 2017;\nFrench and Saatsi 2018); multi-level explanations in biology (Clarke\n2016); “efficient coding” explanations in computational\nneuro-science (Chirimuuta 2014, 2017, 2018). \nAs it will be obvious from the previous discussion, the literature on\nmathematical explanations in the sciences has now grown too large to\nbe described in detail. But here are some further foci of discussion\nthat should be mentioned, without any attempt at completeness.  \nAs we have seen, much attention has been devoted recently to\nstructural explanations in physics, namely explanations of specific\nphenomena given in terms of mathematical properties of the systems in\nwhich they occur. Bokulich 2011, generalizing notions of structural\nexplanation developed in Railton 1980, Hughes 1989, and Clifton 1998\n(Other Internet Resources), speaks of structural model\nexplanation, “that is, one in which the explanandum can be seen\nas a consequence of the structure of the theory or theories employed\nin the model (in this case a particular blending of classical and\nquantum mechanics), which limits what sorts of objects, properties,\nstates or behaviors are admissible within the framework of that\ntheory” (p. 40). \nDorato and Felline 2010b argue that contraction of rods and dilation\nof clocks can be structurally explained by properties of Minkowski\nspace-time (but see also Smart 1990, Colyvan 2001 and 2002 and Lange\n2013a) and Dorato and Felline 2010a claim that quantum entanglement is\nstructurally explained by the non-commutativity of certain operators\nand the uncertainty principle by the properties of the limits of\nFourier transforms (see also Felline 2018 and Dorato 2017).  \nIn biology and medicine such structural explanations are found in\nterms of “topological explanations”. Much of the interest\nin this area has been the analysis of whether, and if so how, such\nexplanations differ from mechanistic explanations (see Huneman 2010,\nBrigandt 2013, Woodward 2013, Jones 2014, Kostic 2016, Huneman 2018,\nDarrason 2018 for case studies and further references). A\ncharacteristic of such explanations is that one makes use of\ngraph-theoretic or topological properties of a system to explain\nproperties of the system such as stability under perturbations.  \nA variety of responses (reductionism to causal accounts, pluralism,\nmonism) can be developed in reaction to the presence of non-causal\nscientific explanations (see Reutlinger 2017c for a discussion of the\noptions). For instance, much work has been devoted to incorporating\nnon-causal explanations into counterfactual theories of explanation\n(see Baron, Colyvan, and Ripley 2017; Bokulich 2008; Kistler 2013;\nSaatsi and Pexton 2013; Pexton 2014; Pincock 2015a; Rice 2015;\nReutlinger 2016, 2018; Saatsi 2018; Jansson and Saatsi 2017; French\nand Saatsi 2018; Woodward 2018).  \nA pressing issue has become that of identifying what is distinctively\nmathematical in mathematical explanations of scientific facts. Lange\n(2013c, 2017, 2018) has recently put forward a modal theory of\nexplanation, according to which mathematical explanations of\nscientific facts act as constraints which have modal necessity\nstronger than causal necessity. As he puts it in Lange 2013c: “A\ndistinctively mathematical explanation works by showing the\nexplanandum to be more necessary (given the physical arrangement in\nquestion) than ordinary causal laws could render it. Distinctively\nmathematical explanations thus supply a kind of understanding that\ncausal explanations cannot.” He calls many of these\nexplanations “explanations by constraint” and\ndistinguishes them from causal explanations and from “really\nstatistical” explanations (for instance, but not exclusively,\nexplanations by regression toward the mean; for more on statistical\nexplanations see Lange 2013b). Craver and Povich 2017 argue that\nLange’s theory of explanation by constraint (and even his account of\n“really statistical” explanations) is flawed, for it fails\nto account for the directionality of the explanatory relation in\ndistinctively mathematical explanations. Pincock 2015a proposes to\naccount for mathematical explanations in science by appealing to a\nnotion of “abstract explanation” considered as one which\ninvolves “an appeal to a more abstract entity than the state of\naffairs being explained.” Pincock defends an ontic account of\nexplanation based on dependence relations that are different from\ncausal relations. Abstract explanations classify systems, as opposed\nto emphasizing the modal character of the system’s properties (see\nalso Pincock 2018). Baron 2017 revamps the deductive-nomological model\nto account for mathematical explanations of scientific facts by using\nan informational account of relevance logic to capture the dependence\nrelation between mathematical facts and physics facts.  \nWhereas the issues treated in section 3.1 affect mainly the\nmethodology of science, a different set of issues has emerged in\nconnection to the nominalism-platonism debate in philosophy of\nmathematics. Colyvan 2010 (and the earlier Colyvan 2006) contrasts\nhard road and easy road nominalism. While the hard road nominalist\noffers non-mathematical versions of our best scientific theories, the\neasy road nominalist simply retains the original, mathematical\nversions of the theories, and qualifies our acceptance of them so as\nto exclude a commitment to abstract entities. Colyvan argues that easy\nroad nominalists such as Azzouni, Melia and Yablo are unable to\naccount for the explanatory role of mathematics in science, for\nexample, the explanation of the absence of asteroids in the Kirkwood\ngaps. He claims that any account of how such explanations are possible\nthat avoids mathematical commitments would require hard road\nnominalism, that is, showing how one can eliminate reference to\nmathematical entities. Replies include Bueno 2012, Yablo 2012, Leng\n2012, and the rejoinder Colyvan 2012a. Bueno claims that the\nmathematics used in scientific explanations only plays a descriptive\nrole and not an explanatory role. Yablo distinguishes three degrees of\nmathematical involvement in physical explanation, the third of which\nentails the existence of mathematical entities but, he claims, it is\nhard to establish whether it ever obtains.  Leng defends the\npossibility of accounting for mathematical explanations\nnominalistically and emphasizes the importance of structural\nexplanations, which according to her do not commit us to mathematical\nobjects but only to physical objects that instantiate a mathematical\nstructure. Much of the discussion in this area, which addresses\nwhether the mathematics present in the formulation of scientific\ntheories or mathematical explanations offered in science is\neliminable, is deeply related to so-called indispensability\narguments.  \nThere is actually a variety of classical indispensability arguments\n(see Colyvan 2001 and Panza and Sereni 2016) but the general structure\nof the argument runs as follows. One begins with the premise that\nmathematics is indispensable for our best science. But, second\npremise, we ought to believe our best theories. Thus, we ought to be\ncommitted to the kind of entities that our best theories quantify\nover. In general this is an argument in favor of Platonism, as our\nbest science quantifies over mathematical entities. \nThere are many ways in which one can attempt to block the argument.\nHowever, the key feature related to our discussion is the following.\nSeveral versions of the indispensability argument rely on a holistic\nconception of scientific theories according to which the ontological\ncommitments of the theory is determined by looking at all the\nexistential claims implied by the theory. However, no attention is paid\nto how the different parts of the theory might be responsible for\ndifferent posits and to the different roles that the latter might play.\nBaker 2005 offers a version of the indispensability argument that does\nnot depend on holism. Baker starts from a debate between Colyvan (2001,\n2002) and Melia (2000, 2002) that saw both authors agreeing that the\nprospects for a successful platonist use of the indispensability\nargument rests on examples from scientific practice in which the\npostulation of mathematical objects results in an increase of those\ntheoretical virtues which are provided by the postulation of\ntheoretical entities. Both authors agree that among such theoretical\nvirtues is explanatory power. Baker believes that such explanations\nexist but also argues that the cases presented in Colyvan 2001 fail to\nbe genuine cases of mathematical explanations of physical phenomena.\nMost of his article is devoted to the specific case study from\nevolutionary biology concerning the life-cycle of the so-called\n‘periodical’ cicada, which was described in section 1.\nRecall that the question of interest was why the life cycle periods of\nsuch cicadas are prime numbers and that the answer appealed to\nevolutionary facts and mathematical properties of prime numbers. After\nthe reconstruction of the explanation, Baker concludes that: \n\nSuch explanations give a new twist to the indispensability argument.\nThe argument now runs as follows. \n\nThe argument has not gone unchallenged. Indeed, Leng 2005 tries to\nresist the conclusion by blocking premise b). She accepts a) but\nquestions the claim that the role of mathematics in such explanations\ncommits us to the real existence (as opposed to a fictional one) of\nthe posits. This, she argues, will be granted when one realizes that\nboth Colyvan and Baker infer illegitimately from the existence of the\nmathematical explanation that the statements grounding the explanation\nare true. She claims that mathematical explanations need not have a\ntrue explanans and consequently the objects posited by such\nexplanations need not exist (see now also Leng 2010, chapter 9).  By\nfocusing on inference to the best explanation, Saatsi 2007 also\nresists the implication that scientific realism forces a commitment to\nmathematical Platonism. Another challenge has been raised by Bangu\n2008, who claims that mathematical language is essential to the\nformulation of the question to be answered (“why is the life\ncycle period prime?”) and thus that the argument begs the\nquestion against the nominalist. The existence of numbers and\nproperties of numbers is already assumed in the acceptance of the\nstatement “the life cycle period is prime”. A similar\nobjection to any attempt to use mathematical explanations in physics\nfor inferring the existence of the mathematical entities involved in\nthe explanation had already been raised in 1978b by Steiner, who had\ndiscarded such arguments with the observation that what needed\nexplanation could not even be described without use of the\nmathematical language. Thus, the existence of mathematical\nexplanations of empirical phenomena could not be used to infer the\nexistence of mathematical entities, for this very existence was\npresupposed in the description of the fact to be explained. Indeed, he\nendorsed a line of argument originating from Quine and Goodman\naccording to which “we cannot say what the world would be like\nwithout numbers, because describing any thinkable experience (except\nfor utter emptiness) presupposes their existence.” (1978b,\n20) \nAmong the most recent contributions arising from Baker’s 2005 article\nwe have Daly and Langford 2009, Baker 2009a, 2015, 2016a, 2017a,\n2017b, Baker and Colyvan 2011, Saatsi 2010, Rizza 2011, Pincock 2012,\nBangu 2013, Baron 2014, Marcus 2013, Tallant 2013, and Wakil and\nJustus 2017. We can only provide here a very short summary of the main\npositions. Daly and Langford side with Melia to claim that the role of\npositing concrete unobservables in science allows the explanation of\nthe behavior of observable facts. By contrast, mathematics has no such\nexplanatory value: it merely ‘indexes’ physical\nfacts. Against Baker they argue that the appearance of primes in the\ncicadas example is only due to the decision to measure those periods\nin years but that a different choice of measure (say, seasons or\nmonths) would give rise to non-prime numbers, thereby showing that\nMelia’s indexing strategy can also apply to the cicadas example. Baker\nand Colyvan 2011 reassert the claim on the existence of mathematical\nexplanations of scientific phenomena and argue that Daly and\nLangford’s strategy is only plausible in extremely simple cases and\nthat the ‘index strategy’ does not square with the\ncomplexities of mathematical and scientific practice. In particular,\nthey also make appeal to the existence of mathematical explanations of\nmathematical facts, for which see below. Baker 2009a defends the\n‘enhanced indispensability arguments’ against criticisms\nby Daly and Langford, Bangu, Leng, and Saatsi. Saatsi 2010 emphasizes\nthe representational role of mathematics and criticizes the alleged\nexplanatory role of mathematics in the explanation of empirical\nphenomena such as the honeycomb case (see below) and the cicadas\ncase. Rizza 2011 is also deflationary about the alleged ontological\nconsequence of the role of mathematics in the cicadas case; however he\ndoes not deny the centrality of mathematical concepts in constructing\nexplanations. Finally, Pincock 2012, chapter 10, also rejects the\ncogency of various formulations of the enhanced indispensability\nargument. The objection is that inference to the best explanation for\nnovel abstract entities requires that those new entities are needed to\nexplain the phenomenon in question. But in the cases discussed in this\ndebate, there is no explanatory value to adding the natural numbers or\nthe real numbers to our theories, over and above nominalistically\nacceptable surrogates (see Pincock 2012, 212). \nAnother reaction to Baker’s argument is provided by Tallant 2013\nwhich, just as Rizza, 2011, defends a ‘piecemeal’ strategy\nfor nominalism, namely to deflate the challenge posed by the cicada\ncase through a nominalization of prime number talk using mereological\nreformulations of the number-theoretic results. A challenge against\nthis strategy is offered by Baker 2017b who claims that the\nentanglement of mathematics in scientific explanation is much deeper\nthan has been realized so far and it extends to mathematical\nproperties that, in addition to having empirical consequences, are\nconsequences of the mathematical theorems appealed to explicitly in\nthe explanations. The claims rely on an explanation of the periods of\nmagicicadas that improves on the original version given in Baker 2005. \nBaker 2016, still relying on the periodical cicada explanation, argues\nthat mathematics can sometimes reduce the ontological commitment to\nconcrete entities and poses a challenge to nominalism, especially the\npiecemeal nominalism described above, based on that\nobservation. Finally, Baker 2017a argues that the mathematical\ncomponent in the cicada case and similar cases, when properly\narticulated, is ‘about’ general facts as opposed to\nindividual facts.  \nModified versions of the indispensability argument stressing the\nimportance of the indispensability of mathematics for explanations in\nscience were considered, before Baker, by the nominalist Field as a\nchallenge to the platonist use of such arguments. Field (1989,\n14–20) accepts the cogency of this type of inference to the best\nexplanation but he argued (Field 1980) that platonist mathematics\ncould be replaced by a nominalistically acceptable theory that was\nsufficient for the development of classical mechanics. In addition,\nthe nominalistic replacement would also have the virtue of providing\n‘intrinsic’ explanations of the physical phenomena (for a\nprobing discussion of ‘intrinsic explanation’ see Marcus\n2013). That led to much discussion as to how far Field’s program could\nbe pushed. Malament 1982 had objected that the obstacles to the\nnominalization of phase-space theories in Hamiltonian mechanics seemed\ninsuperable. Lyon and Colyvan (2008) go beyond Malament’s claim by\narguing that even if a nominalistic reconstruction of phase-space\ntheories were available, the nominalist would still have to show that\nsuch reconstruction can yield the explanations yielded by the\nnon-nominalistic version(s). They believe that the nominalist will\nfail in this task and make a plausible case for their thesis by\nproviding a case study of a physical system known as the\nHénon-Heiles system (incidentally, this same case study is used\nby Molinini 2011 to test the theories of mathematical explanation\noffered by Steiner, Kitcher and van Fraassen). The system describes\nthe motion of a star around a galactic center. Their claim is that the\nphase-space analysis of the system provides explanations that cannot\nbe provided by any nominalist reconstruction. At the end of their\narticle, Lyon and Colyvan also review a few possible moves the\nnominalist can make in response. One such move would deny that\nmathematical explanations have any bearing on physical explanations\nand that some bridge principles linking the mathematics to the\nphysical system, are required. They reply: \n\nLyon and Colyvan grant that while in mathematical explanations of\nempirical facts such bridge principles are required, they “do\nnot seem to do anything more than allow the transmission of the\nmathematical explanations to the empirical domain” (p. 15). \nSaatsi 2017 criticizes Lyon and Colyvan 2008 by questioning the\nconclusiveness of the appeal to phase spaces in bringing about\nexplanations which would allow the deployment of an enhanced\nindispensability argument. After proposing a strengthening of the\nindispensability argument by appealing to attractors in dynamical\nsystem theory, he concludes that understanding how explanations work\nin dynamical system theory undermines the Platonist use of the\nenhanced indispensability argument. \n\nAccording to Lyon and Colyvan, a proper account of explanations in\nscience requires an analysis of mathematical explanations in pure\nmathematics.  Indeed, this was also the major intuition behind\nSteiner’s account of mathematical explanation in science offered in\n1978b, whose central idea was that a mathematical explanation of a\nphysical fact is one in which a mathematical explanation of a\nmathematical fact results when we remove the physics. Steiner used as\ncentral example for his analysis Euler’s theorem on the existence of\nan instantaneous axis of rotation in rigid body kinematics. Baker\n2009a discusses briefly Steiner’s account and declares it\n‘seriously flawed’(p. 623) but Molinini 2012 is more\nenlightening as it subjects the Euler example used by Steiner to a\ndetailed scrutiny and compares alternative explanatory proofs of the\nsame result. Steiner’s theory, as we have mentioned, requires an\naccount of mathematical explanations of mathematical facts, which he\nprovided in Steiner 1978a. It is important to add that serious\nobjections have been raised to the idea that mathematical explanations\nof scientific facts require a mathematical explanation of a\nmathematical fact as part of the explanation. For instance, Baker 2015\nargues against Steiner’s account by pointing out that in the cicada\ncase or in the honeycomb cell case only the mathematical results are\nappealed to but not their proofs. \nLyon & Colyvan 2008 also contains a much discussed example from\nevolutionary biology. Why do hive-bee honeycombs have a hexagonal\nstructure? The nature of the question is contrastive: why hexagonal as\nopposed to, say, any other polygonal figure or combination thereof?\nPart of the explanation depends on evolutionary facts. Bees that use\nless wax and thus spend less energy have a better chance at evolving\nvia natural selection. The explanation is completed by pointing out\nthat ‘any partition of the plane into regions of equal area has\nperimeter at least that of the regular hexagonal honeycomb\ntiling’. Thus, the hexagonal tiling is optimal with respect to\ndividing the plane into equal areas and minimizing the perimeter. This\nfact, known as the ‘honeycomb conjecture’ was recently\nproved in Hales 2001 (see also Hales 2000). The explanation of the\nbiological fact seems to depend essentially on a mathematical\nfact. Just like the cicada example, this case has been extensively\ndiscussed in the literature.  \nSome have questioned whether the example is a case of genuine\nexplanation. For instance, Räz 2013 points out that the honeycomb\ntheorem is a two-dimensional theorem but that the real-life problem\nmust address the three-dimensional structure of the honeycomb\ncells. In Räz 2017 several alternative scientific explanations of\nthe structure of the honeycomb cells are discussed and used to\nevaluate the positions of Pincock (2012) and Baker (2015) on the kind\nof optimization result that is needed to explain the structure of the\nhoneycomb cells (Pincock, contra Baker, claims that the optimality of\nthe hexagonal shape among regular polygons is sufficient and there is\nno need to appeal to the general honeycomb conjecture). Wakil and\nJustus (2017, 917) criticize both the cicada example as well as the\nhoneycomb example on the basis that both examples commit the\noptimality fallacy, namely ‘assuming a trait exists because it\nwas selected for as a solution to a biological optimization\nproblem.’ \nLyon 2012 sketches a more general theory of mathematical explanations\nof scientific facts. Starting from the, by now, standard stock of\nexamples discussed in the literature on mathematical explanations of\nscientific facts (the bees, the cicadas, the sunflower seeds, the\nbridges of Königsberg, the Kirkwood gaps, the Plateau soap film,\netc.), Lyon thinks that they share important properties that can be\ncaptured through a distinction already available in the literature on\nexplanation in general philosophy of science. The distinction is that\nformulated by Jackson and Pettit (1990) between process explanations\nand program explanations. Lyon’s observation is that in all the\nstandard examples of mathematical explanations listed above there are,\nin addition to the mathematical explanations, alternative explanations\nthat are causal. Such alternative explanations work at a level of\ngranularity (indicating all the spatio-temporal coordinates, forces\nacting on the bodies etc.) that is not present in the mathematical\nexplanations. Following the lead of Jackson and Pettit, Lyon calls the\nformer process explanations and the latter program explanation: \nWhile Lyon does not claim that all mathematical explanations in\nscience are process program explanations, he argues that the cases\nthat have been at the center of attention in the discussion of\nmathematical explanations of scientific phenomena are special cases of\nprogram explanation, namely those in which the mathematics is\nindispensable to the programming. Lyon also defends the thesis that\nwhat characterizes mathematical explanations of scientific facts is a\ncertain modal stability (see also the discussion of Lange 2013c in the\nprevious subsection) which account for their being good explanations,\nan explanation that does not have to be altered even when the causal\nhistory for the occurrence of the event (say, the cracking of a glass\nflask) had been different from the actual ones. Saatsi 2012 denies\nthat the cases analyzed by Lyon fit the Jackson-Pettit model of\nprogram explanation and thus resists Lyon’s use of the examples to\nbuttress a realistic interpretation of the mathematics used in those\nexplanations. For further discussion of program and process\nexplanations applied to logical explanations of scientific facts see\nBaron and Colyvan 2016. \nOne of the aspects of the enhanced indispensability argument that has\ngenerated much attention is that the argument seems to presuppose a\nform of inference to the best explanation. An inference to the best\nexplanation licenses, when one is presented with several alternative\nexplanations of the same phenomenon, the acceptance as true of the\nbest among such explanations. In addition to raising the crucial issue\nof determining whether a certain argument is a mathematical\nexplanation of a scientific fact, we are also confronted with the\nfurther issue of how to rank alternative explanations and of whether\nthe appeal to inference to the best explanation in arguing for\nscientific realism carries over to an argument for mathematical\nrealism. Such inferences have been at the center of much discussion in\nphilosophy of science (see Lipton 2004). In the context of enhanced\nindispensability arguments, they were also discussed, in addition to\nseveral of the articles cited so far, in several articles contained in\nthe special issue of Synthese (2016, n. 193) edited by Molinini,\nPataut, and Sereni (see Molinini 2016, Sereni 2016, Busch and Morrison\n2016, Hunt 2016, and Molinini, Pataut, and Sereni 2016 for a lucid\nintroduction). Molinini 2016 uses alternative mathematical\nexplanations of scientific facts in kinematics (using a case study\nfrom Euler studied in Molinini 2012) and special relativity (using a\ncase study on the FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction studied in detail in\nFriend and Molinini 2015) to put pressure on the inference to the best\nexplanation underlying the enhanced indispensability argument. The\nexistence of alternative mathematical explanations of the same\nphenomenon, appealing to two different mathematical entities, speaks\nagainst the indispensability of any of those entities for providing an\nexplanation of the phenomenon in question. He concludes: “the\nnotion of explanatory power of mathematics in science has no\nontological import and cannot be used in EIA [enhanced\nindispensability argument]” (pp. 420-421). Sereni 2016, a reply\nto Molinini 2016, offers some important reflections on the issue of\nthe equivalent explanations problem. The issue of compatible\nmathematical explanations (positing the same physical ontology but\nappealing to different mathematical entities) is also central to Hunt\n2016 where Hunt argues that ‘in cases of compatible mathematical\nexplanations, IBE cannot establish ontological commitment to\nmathematical entities’ (p. 452). Hunt’s article is a reply to\nBusch and Morrison 2016 (see also Busch 2011), which focuses on the\nparity of reasoning, or lack thereof, between scientific and\nmathematical realists. Indeed, they claim that inference to the best\nexplanation is used differently in arguments for scientific realism\nfrom the way it is used in arguments for mathematical realism (see\nalso Colyvan 2001, 2006) and that this undermines the use of the\nenhanced indispensability argument as establishing Platonism.  \nConnected to the evaluation of indispensability arguments in\nphilosophy of mathematics are also a set of articles comparing\nindispensability arguments in moral theory and philosophy of\nmathematics contained in the collection Leibowitz and Sinclair 2016\n(see the introduction to the volume by the editors and contributions\nby Miller, Liggins, Roberts, Leng, Baker, and Enoch). \nBefore concluding this section, let me mention a few additional\ncontributions. Bangu 2013 proposes a challenge for the nominalist by\noffering a simple example in terms of games between two players and\nclaims that the nominalist, unlike the realist, is unable to account\nfor the common features of certain rearrangements that can only be\nexplained by reference to a common mathematical structure of the\nrearrangements.  Marcus 2013 distinguishes epistemic and metaphysical\nreadings of the explanatory indispensability argument and claims that\nonce one disambiguates the two readings, the explanatory\nindispensability argument is no improvement on the standard Quinean\nindispensability argument. Baron 2015 argues for the validity of the\nfollowing conditional: “if there are extramathematical\nexplanations, then the core thesis of the access problem is\nfalse” and claims that far-reaching conclusions follow for the\nPlatonist (a solution to the access problem) and the nominalist (who\ncan use the conditional to reject the existence of extramathematical\nexplanations). Baron 2016a is an exploratory investigation on the\nnature of the ontological dependence relating mathematicand and\nempirical facts in a genuine mathematical explanation of scientific\nfacts. The topic is also connected to the general issue of grounding\n(see Raven 2015 for an overview on grounding and Liggins 2016 and\nPlebani 2016 for further contributions on indispensability arguments\nand grounding). \nFriend and Molinini 2015 generalize the question of mathematical\nexplanations of scientific phenomena to two further questions: are\nthere wholly (as opposed to partial, as in the standard cases such as\nthe cicada case) mathematical explanations of scientific phenomena?\nAnd: are there wholly mathematical explanations of scientific\ntheories? They answer in the affirmative using as a case study the\nwork on the axiomatization of relativity theory carried out by Hajnal\nAndréka, Judit Madarász, István Németi and\nGergely Székely. \nWe now turn to mathematical explanations within mathematics. \nMuch mathematical activity is driven by factors other than\njustificatory aims such as establishing the truth of a mathematical\nfact. In many cases knowledge that something is the case will be\nconsidered unsatisfactory and this will lead mathematicians to probe\nthe situation further to look for better explanations of the facts\n(see Atiyah’s vivid account of an instance of this in Minio 1996, 17).\nThis might take the form of, just to give a few examples, providing\nalternative proofs for known results, giving an account for surprising\nanalogies, or recasting an entire area of mathematics on a new basis\nin the pursuit of a more satisfactory ‘explanatory’\naccount of the area. The phenomenology of the variety of such\nexplanatory activities has been partially investigated in Sandborg\n(1997, ch. 1) and Hafner & Mancosu 2005 (see also Robinson 2000\nfor a cognitive analysis of proof emphasizing explanatory factors,\nLange 2017 for further examples, and Colyvan 2012b for a textbook\npresentation). \n\nConsider for instance the case of Gregory Brumfiel, a real algebraic\ngeometer. In his book “Partially ordered rings and\nsemi-algebraic geometry” (1979), Brumfiel contrasts different\nmethods for proving theorems about real closed fields. One of them\nrelies on a decision procedure for a particular axiomatization of the\ntheory of real closed fields. By this method one can find elementary\nproofs of sentences formulated in the language of that theory—at\nleast in principle, since, as Brumfiel remarks, “it certainly\nmight be very tedious, if not physically impossible, to work out this\nelementary proof.” (166) \n\nAnother method of proof consists in using a so-called transfer\nprinciple which allows one to infer the truth of a sentence for all\nreal closed fields from its being true in one real closed field, say\nthe real numbers. Despite the fact that the transfer principle is a\nvery efficient tool, Brumfiel does not make any use of it, and he is\nvery clear about this. \n\nBrumfiel prefers a third proof method which aims at giving\nnon-transcendental proofs of purely algebraic results. This does not\nmean that he restricts himself to just elementary methods; he does use\nstronger tools but it is crucial that they apply uniformly to all real\nclosed fields. \n\nWhile one could easily provide myriads of evaluations by\nmathematicians contrasting explanatory and non-explanatory proofs of\nthe same theorem, it is important to point out that explanations in\nmathematics do not only come in the form of proofs (this has been also\nemphasized by D’Alessandro 2018, who however unfortunately ignores\nclaims to this effect in the previous literature on mathematical\nexplanation). In some cases explanations are sought in a major\nconceptual recasting of an entire discipline. In such situations the\nmajor conceptual recasting will also produce new proofs but the\nexplanatoriness of the new proofs is derivative on the conceptual\nrecasting. This leads to a more global (or holistic picture) of\nexplanation than the one based on the focus on individual proofs.\nMancosu 2001 describes in detail such a global case of explanatory\nactivity from complex analysis; see also Kitcher 1984 and Tappenden\n2005 for additional case studies. \n\nSince contributions in analytic philosophy to the study of\nmathematical explanations date back only to Steiner 1978a, one might\nsuspect that the topic was a byproduct of the Quinean conception of\nscientific theories (see Resnik & Kushner, 1987, 154). Once\nmathematics and natural science were placed on the same footing, it\nbecame possible to apply a unified methodology to both areas. Thus, it\nmade sense to look for explanations in mathematics just as in natural\nscience. However, this historical reconstruction would be mistaken.\nMathematical explanations of mathematical facts have been part of\nphilosophical reflection since Aristotle. We have already seen the\ndistinction Aristotle drew between demonstrations “of the\nfact” and demonstrations “of the reasoned fact”. Both\nare logically rigorous but only the latter provide explanations for\ntheir results. Aristotle had also claimed that demonstrations “of\nthe reasoned fact” occur in mathematics. On account of what we\nsaid in section 2, these demonstrations can be called\n“explanatory” demonstrations. Aristotle’s position on\nexplanatory proofs in mathematics was already challenged in ancient\ntimes. Proclus, in his “Commentary on the first book of\nEuclid’s Elements”, informs us on this point. He reports:\n“Many persons have thought that geometry does not investigate the\ncause, that is, does not ask the question\n‘Why?’” (Proclus 1970, 158–159; for more on Proclus on\nmathematical explanation see Harari 2008). Proclus himself singles out\ncertain propositions in Euclid’s “Elements”, such as\nI.32, as not being demonstrations “of the reasoned fact”.\nEuclid I.32 states that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is\nequal to two right angles. If the demonstration were given by a\nscientific syllogism in the Aristotelean sense, the middle of the\nsyllogism would have to provide the ‘cause’ of the fact.\nBut Proclus argues that Euclid’s proof does not satisfy these\nAristotelian constraints, for the appeal to the auxiliary lines and\nexterior angles is not ‘causal’: \n\nIn addition, Proclus also held that proofs by contradiction were not\ndemonstrations “of the reasoned fact”. The rediscovery of\nProclus in the Renaissance was to spark a far-reaching debate on the\ncausality of mathematical demonstrations referred to above as the\nQuaestio de Certitudine Mathematicarum. The first shot was fired by\nAlessandro Piccolomini in 1547. Piccolomini’s aim was to disarm a\ntraditional claim to the effect that mathematics derives its certainty\non account of its use of “scientific demonstrations” in\nthe Aristotelean sense (such proofs were known as\n“potissimae” in the Renaissance). Since\n“potissimae” demonstrations had to be causal, Piccolomini\nattacked the argument by arguing that mathematical demonstrations are\nnot causal. This led to one of the most interesting epistemological\ndebates of the Renaissance and the seventeenth century. Those denying\nthe “causality” of mathematical demonstrations\n(Piccolomini, Pereyra, Gassendi etc.)  argued by providing specific\nexamples of demonstrations from mathematical practice (usually from\nEuclid’s Elements) which, they claimed, could not be reconstructed as\ncausal reasonings in the Aristotelian sense. By contrast, those hoping\nto restore “causality” to mathematics aimed at showing\nthat the alleged counterexamples could easily be accommodated within\nthe realm of “causal” demonstrations (Clavius, Barrow,\netc.). The historical developments have been presented in detail in\nMancosu 1996 and Mancosu 2000. What is more important here is to\nappreciate that the basic intuition—the contraposition between\nexplanatory and non-explanatory demonstrations—had a long and\nsuccessful history and influenced both mathematical and philosophical\ndevelopments well beyond the seventeenth century. For instance Mancosu\n1999 shows that Bolzano and Cournot, two major philosophers of\nmathematics in the nineteenth century, construe the central problem of\nphilosophy of mathematics as that of accounting for the distinction\nbetween between explanatory and non-explanatory demonstrations. In the\ncase of Bolzano this takes the form of a theory of Grund (ground) and\nFolge (consequence). Kitcher 1975 was the first to read Bolzano as\npropounding a theory of mathematical explanations (see Betti 2010 and\nRoski 2017 for recent contributions). In the case of Cournot this is\nspelled out in terms of the opposition between “ordre\nlogique” and “ordre rationnel” (see Cournot\n1851). In Bolzano’s case, the aim of providing a reconstruction of\nparts of analysis and geometry, so that the exposition would use only\n“explanatory” proofs, also led to major mathematical\nresults, such as his purely analytic proof of the intermediate value\ntheorem. \nIn conclusion to this section, we should also point out that there is\nanother tradition of thinking of explanation in mathematics that\nincludes Mill, Lakatos, Russell and Gödel. These authors are\nmotivated by a conception of mathematics (and/or its foundations) as\nhypothetico-deductive in nature and this leads them to construe\nmathematical activity in analogy with how explanatory hypotheses occur\nin science (see Mancosu 2001 for more details). Related to inductivism\nare Cellucci 2008 and 2017, which emphasize the connection between mathematical\nexplanation and discovery.  \n\nIn section 4 it was pointed out that two major forms of the search for\nexplanations in mathematical practice occur at the level of comparison\nbetween different proofs of the same result and in the conceptual\nrecasting of major areas. These two types of explanatory activity lead\nto two different conceptions of explanation. These conceptions could\nbe characterized as local and global. The point is that in the former\ncase explanatoriness is primarily a (local) property of proofs whereas\nin the latter it is a (global) property of the whole theory or\nframework and the proofs are judged explanatory on account of their\nbeing part of the framework. While these two types of explanatory\nactivity do not exhaust the varieties of mathematical explanations\nthat occur in practice, the contraposition between local and global\ncaptures well the major difference between the two major classical\naccounts of mathematical explanation, those of Steiner and Kitcher\n(more recent accounts will be discussed in section 7). While we shall\nemphasize the local/global dichotomy, it is important to add that there are\nother ways to conceptualize the major alternatives in the theory of\nmathematical explanation. For instance, Kim 1994 uses the\ncontraposition between ‘explanatory internalism’ and\n‘explanatory externalism’ to give a taxonomy of the\ndifferent accounts of scientific explanation. Whereas for\n‘explanatory internalism’ explanations are activities\ninternal to an epistemic corpus (a theory or set of beliefs), an\n‘explanatory externalist’ will look for some ontic\nrelations that ground the explanatory relations reflected in\nlinguistic ascriptions of explanatoriness. This taxonomy is orthogonal\nto the local/global taxonomy and we only mention here that the\nspirit of Kitcher’s theory of explanation is ‘internalist’\nwhereas that of Steiner is ‘externalist’. \n\nBefore discussing them, it should also be pointed out that other\nmodels of scientific explanation can be thought to extend to\nmathematical explanation. They will be discussed in section 7. \n\nSteiner proposed his model of mathematical explanation in 1978a. In\ndeveloping his own account of explanatory proof in mathematics he\ndiscusses—and rejects—a number of initially plausible\ncriteria for explanation, e.g. the (greater degree of) abstractness or\ngenerality of a proof, its visualizability, and its genetic aspect that\nwould give rise to the discovery of the result. In contrast, Steiner\ntakes up the idea “that to explain the behaviour of an entity,\none deduces the behavior from the essence or nature of the\nentity” (Steiner 1978a, 143). In order to avoid the notorious\ndifficulties in defining the concepts of essence and essential (or\nnecessary) property, which, moreover, do not seem to be useful in\nmathematical contexts anyway since all mathematical truths are regarded\nas necessary, Steiner introduces the concept of characterizing\nproperty. (Let me mention as an aside that Kit Fine distinguishes\nbetween essential and necessary properties and that perhaps the\ndistinction could be exploited in this context). By characterizing\nproperty Steiner means “a property unique to a given entity or\nstructure within a family or domain of such entities or\nstructures”, where the notion of family is taken as undefined.\nHence what distinguishes an explanatory proof from a non-explanatory\none is that only the former involves such a characterizing property. In\nSteiner’s words: “an explanatory proof makes reference to a\ncharacterizing property of an entity or structure mentioned in the\ntheorem, such that from the proof it is evident that the result depends\non the property”. Furthermore, an explanatory proof is\ngeneralizable in the following sense. Varying the relevant feature (and\nhence a certain characterizing property) in such a proof gives rise to\nan array of corresponding theorems, which are proved—and\nexplained—by an array of “deformations” of the\noriginal proof. Thus Steiner arrives at two criteria for explanatory\nproofs, i.e. dependence on a characterizing property and\ngeneralizability through varying of that property (Steiner 1978a, 144,\n147). \nSteiner’s model was criticized by Resnik & Kushner 1987 who\nquestioned the absolute distinction between explanatory and\nnon-explanatory proofs and argued that such a distinction can only be\ncontext-dependent. They also provided counterexamples to the criteria\ndefended by Steiner. In Hafner & Mancosu 2005 it is argued that\nResnik and Kushner’s criticisms are insufficient as a challenge to\nSteiner for they rely on ascribing explanatoriness to specific proofs\nbased not on evaluations given by practicing mathematicians but rather\nrelying on the intuitions of the authors. By contrast, Hafner and\nMancosu build their case against Steiner using a case of explanation\nfrom real analysis, recognized as such in mathematical practice, which\nconcerns the proof of Kummer’s convergence criterion. They argue that\nthe explanatoriness of the proof of the result in question cannot be\naccounted for in Steiner’s model and this criticism is instrumental in\ngiving a careful and detailed scrutiny of various conceptual\ncomponents of the model. In addition, further discussion of Steiner’s\naccount is provided in Weber &\nVerhoeven 2002, Pincock 2015b, Salverda 2017, and Gijsbers 2017. \n\nKitcher is a well known defender of an account of scientific\nexplanation as theoretical unification. Kitcher sees one of the virtues\nof his viewpoint to be that it can also be applied to explanation in\nmathematics, unlike other theories of scientific explanation whose\ncentral concepts, say causality or laws of nature, do not seem relevant\nto mathematics. Kitcher has not devoted any single article to\nmathematical explanation and thus his position can only be gathered\nfrom what he says about mathematics in his major articles on scientific\nexplanation. In Kitcher 1989, he uses\nunification as the overarching model for explanation both in science\nand mathematics: \n\nKitcher claims that behind the account of explanation given by\nHempel’s covering law model—the official model of explanation\nfor logical positivism—there was an unofficial model which saw\nexplanation as unification. What should one expect from an account of\nexplanation? Kitcher in 1981 points out two things. First, a theory of\nexplanation should account for how science advances our understanding\nof the world. Secondly, it should help us in evaluating or arbitrating\ndisputes in science. He claims that the covering law model fails on\nboth counts and he proposes that his unification account fares much\nbetter. \n\nKitcher found inspiration in Friedman 1974 where Friedman put\nforward the idea that understanding of the world is achieved by science\nby reducing the number of facts we take as brute: \n\nFriedman tried to make this intuition more precise by substituting\nlinguistic descriptions in place of an appeal to phenomena and\nlaws. Kitcher disagrees with the specific details of Friedman’s\nproposal but thinks that the general intuition is correct. He modifies\nFriedman’s proposal by emphasizing that what lies behind unification\nis the reduction of the number of argument patterns used in providing\nexplanations while being as comprehensive as possible in the number of\nphenomena explained: \n\nLet us make this a little bit more formal. Let us start with a\nset K of beliefs assumed to be consistent and deductively\nclosed (informally one can think of this as a set of statements\nendorsed by an ideal scientific community at a specific moment in\ntime; Kitcher 1981, p.75).  A systematization of K is any set\nof arguments that derive some sentences in K from other\nsentences of K. The explanatory store over K,\nE(K), is the best systematization of K\n(Kitcher here makes an idealization by claiming\nthat E(K) is unique). Corresponding to different\nsystematizations we have different degrees of unification.  The\nhighest degree of unification is that given\nby E(K). But according to what criteria can a\nsystematization be judged to be the best? There are three factors: the\nnumber of patterns, the stringency of the patterns and the set of\nconsequences derivable from the unification. \n\nWe cannot enter here into the technicalities of Kitcher’s\nmodel. Unlike Steiner’s model of mathematical explanation,\nKitcher’s account of mathematical explanation has not been\nextensively discussed (in contrast to the extensive discussion of his\nmodel in the context of general philosophy of science). A general\ndiscussion is found in Tappenden 2005 but not a detailed analysis. The\nonly exception is Hafner & Mancosu 2008, where Kitcher’s\nmodel is tested in light of Brumfiel’s case from real algebraic\ngeometry, described in section 4. The authors argue that\nKitcher’s model makes predictions about explanatoriness that go\nagainst specific cases in mathematical practice (see also Pincock 2015b). \nThe developments of the last decade take on board the suggestion (see\nMancosu 2008b) to follow a “bottom up” approach to\nmathematical explanation, investigating cases considered explanatory\nin mathematical practice and resisting the temptation to argue\n“top down” by proposing encompassing approaches to\nmathematical explanation without a previous extensive analysis of\nindividual case studies. However, interest in the “top\ndown” approaches is still lively and informs the discussion of\nmany particular case studies. Apart from a single dissenting voice\n(Zelcer 2013, see also the reply Weber and Frans 2017), contributors\nin this area all accept mathematical explanation of mathematical facts\nas a datum about mathematical practice that philosophers of\nmathematics have to investigate.  \nMarc Lange (2009a) has argued that a whole class of\narguments fail to be explanatory, namely arguments by mathematical\ninduction. Letting A(x) be a property, mathematical\ninduction licenses the conclusion that for\nall n, A(n), from the premises A(1) and\nfor all n, (if A(n)\nthen A(n′)). Lange’s argument rests on contrasting\nordinary mathematical induction with a form of upward and downward\ninduction from a fixed number k (k≠1; say, 5), which is\ndeductively equivalent to ordinary induction. He then claims that if\nproofs by ordinary mathematical induction are explanatory so are\nproofs by upward and downward induction from a fixed number\nk≠1. But if so, one ends up, so the argument concludes, with\nP(1) part of the explanation for P(k)\nand P(k) part of the explanation for P(1) and\nthis contradicts the non-circularity of mathematical explanations\n(which is one of the premises about mathematical explanations defended\nby Lange). By reductio, the original proof by ordinary mathematical\ninduction is not explanatory. Baker 2009b rejects the claim that the\nproof by ordinary mathematical induction and the proof by upward and\ndownward induction from k are equally explanatory. He points\nout that the latter type of induction is more\n‘disjunctive’ than the former and contains elements that\nare irrelevant to the explanation.  Cariani 2011 (see Other Internet\nResources) also focuses on the explanatory asymmetry between the two\ntypes of induction but with considerations different from those of\nBaker. He insists on ‘simplicity’ as the explanatory\ntie-breaker between proofs of the same theorem by appeal to the two\ndifferent types of induction and concludes with considerations leading\none to suspect that there is no global answer to the question of\nwhether proofs by mathematical induction are explanatory. \nLange’s argument has been also contested in several recent articles\nsuch as Hoeltje et al. 2013, Baldwin 2016, and Dougherty 2017. Hoeltje\net al. reject what they see as an unacknowledged assumption in Lange’s\nargument, namely that a universal sentence explains its\ninstances. Baldwin offers positive considerations as to why inductive\narguments are explanatory and he also focuses his criticisms of\nLange’s argument on the latter’s assumption that an instance of a\nuniversal generalization cannot help explain the universal\ngeneralization. Dougherty’s line of attack is based on Lange’s need to\npresuppose a problematic notion of identity of proofs, which he\nquestions using an alternative criterion of identity spelled out using\ntwo equivalent characterizations (the first appealing to the language\nof homotopy type theory and the second using algebraic representatives\nto proofs). \nLange 2017 (section 3, chapters 7 to 9) brings together several\ninvestigations on mathematical explanation by the same author (see\nLange 2010a, 2010b, 2014, 2015b, 2015c; in what follows, we mainly\nreference the book of 2017). Lange’s investigations are characterized\nby a rich and varied choice of examples, which lead him to argue that\nalthough mathematical explanations do not fall under a general\npattern, there are interesting classes of explanations. In chapter 7\nof Lange 2017, Lange emphasizes the importance of symmetry and\nsimplicity in mathematical explanations. The idea is that faced with a\nresult that displays a salient symmetry, the explanation will be the\none that will be able to account for the symmetry of the result by\nexploiting a symmetry in the set-up of the problem. Lange gives many\nexamples (drawn from probability, real analysis, number theory,\ncomplex numbers, geometry etc.) including one concerning d’Alembert’s\ntheorem (an example of explanation by subsumption under a theorem) to\nthe effect that in a polynomial equation of n-th degree in the\nvariable x and having only real coefficients, the nonreal roots\nwill always come in pairs (both a non-real root and its complex\nconjugate will satisfy the equation). What explains this symmetry? A\nnon-explanatory proof can be given by algebraic manipulations but this\ndoes not reveal the reason for the result which, according to Lange,\nis the fact that the axioms of complex arithmetic are invariant under\nsubstitution of i for -i. Lange offers similar\nconsiderations, using further case studies from geometry and\ncombinatorics, for simplicity: if the statement strikes us as simple\nthen an and explanatory proof should be able to account for it using\nsimple features of the set up. \nIn chapter 8 of his book, Lange discusses the notion of mathematical\ncoincidence (see also Lange 2010a, Baker 2009c). Consider the\nfollowing array of “calculator” numbers: \nConsider the numbers generated by juxtaposing each row, column, or\nmain diagonal with its reverse image. For instance, 123321 or\n159951. Every such number (there are sixteen in total) is divisible by\n37. Is this a coincidence? Notice that you can check each of the sixteen\nnumbers and prove that 37 is a factor. But this provides no\nexplanation. It turns out there is an explanation which is connected\nto the fact that each such number can be expressed in terms of\narithmetic progressions of the\nform a, a+d, a+2d (and their\nreverse). A theorem by Nummela (1987) shows that divisibility by 37 follows\nfrom a common feature of the sixteen numbers (i.e. they can all be\nexpressed in the same form). Appealing to this and other examples,\nLange analyzes at length what distinguishes coincidences from\nnon-coincidences and argues that non-coincidences admit of an\nexplanatory proof. The analysis brings into play several interesting\nfeatures, such as unification, saliency, natural properties in\nmathematics, fruitfulness etc.  In the process, Lange also argues for\nthe claim that mathematical explanations are context-dependent since\n‘in different contexts different features might be\nsalient’ (p. 299). Among the claims defended in chapter 8 is\nthat there are some clear cases that show that purity and explanation\ncome apart. The topics of purity, fruitfulness, coincidence,\nunification, natural properties etc. come together in chapter 9, which\nis devoted to Desargues’ plane theorem in projective geometry. Lange\ndiscusses and contrasts proofs of the theorem given in the context of\nsynthetic geometry, analytic geometry and projective (synthetic)\ngeometry. He argues that the projective proof, which obtains the\nresult by projective means from a spatial version of the same result,\nprovides the required explanation which eludes all the other\nproofs. Noteworthy are the connections Lange establishes between\nexplanation, natural properties, and fruitfulness (see also Tappenden\n2008a and 2008b). \nAnother rich discussion of an example of explanation from mathematical\npractice has been offered in Pincock 2015b. Pincock focuses on the\nproof of the impossibility of solving a quintic equation by\nradicals. Several proofs are looked at and the proof given in terms of\nGalois theory is singled out as explanatory. Pincock is especially\ninterested in the abstract nature of the explanation, which in his\naccount functions by appeal to an entity that is more abstract than\nthe subject matter of the theorem itself. The proof of the result\ngiven in terms of Galois theory, according to Pincock, ‘is an\nexplanatory proof because it invokes a special sort of ontological\ndependence between distinct mathematical domains.’ (p. 3) As\noften with accounts that end up appealing to grounding of various\nsorts, Pincock also does not think that the dependence in question can\nbe explicated in simpler terms. \nAnother interesting case study is found in Colyvan et al. 2018. There\nthe main example is the theorem to the effect that, given any\nset X, there exists a free group over X (The Free Group\nTheorem). The authors analyze and contrast a constructive proof of the\nresult and a more abstract but non-constructive proof. They compare\nand contrast the two proofs with known models of scientific\nexplanation and find that the first proof has features in common with\nthe reductive account of explanation while the second is more in line\nwith unificationist accounts. They conclude that both proofs have\nexplanatory virtues. The discussion ends up highlighting the problem\nof how to compare and rank the explanatoriness of proofs and claims\nthat explanatory virtues come in degrees. An additional case study\nconcerning compactness is provided in Paseau 2010.  \nIn addition to the unification model, other models of scientific\nexplanation have been tested with an eye to mathematical\nexplanation. For instance, Sandborg (1997, 1998) tests van Fraassen’s\naccount of explanation as answers to why-questions by using cases of\nmathematical explanation. Molinini 2014 subjects Hempel’s D-N model to\na probing analysis with respect to how it deals with mathematical\nexplanations (both of scientific facts and of mathematical\nfacts). Frans and Weber 2014 propose to apply mechanistic accounts to\nmathematical explanations where talk of capacities in the former\naccount is rendered in terms of dependencies in the latter account\n(the approach is discussed also in Baracco 2017). Reutlinger 2016 and\nGijsbers 2017 modify Woodward’s counterfactual theory (by eliminating\nthe appeal to interventions) so as to apply it to mathematical\nexplanation. \nA number of fruitful conceptual intersections have been investigated\nin the recent literature, such as explanation and beauty, explanation\nand purity, explanation and depth, explanation and inter-theoretic\nreduction, and explanation and style. It is not my intent here to\nprovide an encompassing overview of the literature on mathematical\nbeauty, purity of methods, understanding in mathematics, mathematical\nstyle, and mathematical depth. We simply refer to one or two such\nbackground studies and encourage the reader to explore the\nbibliography of the studies referred to. \nInterest in mathematical beauty, and especially the beauty of\nmathematical proofs has received much emphasis of late (see Cellucci\n2014, Raman-Sundström et al. 2016, Inglis and Aberdein 2015,\nThomas 2017). The most extensive studies connecting mathematical\nbeauty and explanation are Giaquinto 2016, Lange 2016, and Dutilh\nNovaes, 2018. Giaquinto argues against what might be a prima facie\npersuasive claim, namely that explanatory proofs and beautiful proofs\ntend to be the same. He claims that there are reasons to doubt that\nexplanatory proofs tend to be beautiful and insufficient evidence for\nestablishing the converse implication. Lange also compares virtues of\nmathematical proofs such as beauty and explanatoriness and concludes\nthat ‘the features of a proof that would contribute to its\nexplanatory power would also contribute to its beauty, but that these\ntwo virtues are not the same; a beautiful proof need not be\nexplanatory.’ By contrast, Dutilh Novaes develops an account of\nmathematical beauty in terms of explanatoriness within the conceptual\nframework of a dialogical theory of proofs and exploiting the concept\nof ‘functional beauty’. She claims that ‘when\nmathematicians attribute aesthetic properties to proofs, they are by\nand large (though not entirely) tracking the epistemic property of\nexplanatoriness.’ \nThe notion of purity of method has long been of interest to\nmathematicians and philosophers (for recent contributions see\nDetlefsen and Arana 2011 and Arana and Mancosu 2012). Informally, the\nnotion can be explained s follows. Given a statement of a certain area\nof mathematics, one would like a proof of the statement, if provable,\nto make use of conceptual resources that are not ‘foreign’\nto the content of the statement. For instance, given a statement of\nelementary number theory one would like its proof to make use of\nresources that belong to elementary number theory. Proofs of an\nelementary number theoretic statements that appeal to complex analysis\nor topological dynamics would seem to appeal to concepts that are\n‘foreign’ to the subject matter. This is one way to draw\nthe pure/impure distinction in mathematics. The relation between\nexplanatoriness and purity has been emphasized in Skow 2015 and Lange\n2014. Skow, using a proof of the Pythagorean theorem that relies on\nphysical principles, argues that there are explanations of\nmathematical results that rely on physical principles and are thus not\npure. As mentioned above, using the case of Desargues’ theorem, Lange\nclaims that the proof of Desargues’ plane theorem that uses properties\nof projective space is explanatory but impure.  \nWe have already seen when discussing Kitcher and Friedman that the\nnotion of understanding is tied to that of explanation. There has been\nrecent work on mathematical and scientific understanding (see, for\ninstance, Avigad 2008, de Regt and Dieks 2005, de Regt, Leonelli, and\nEigner 2013, de Regt 2017). In connection to mathematical explanation,\nunderstanding has been discussed in Molinini 2011, Cellucci 2014,\nDelariviére et al. 2017. \nMathematical depth was the subject of a special issue\nof Philosophia Mathematica published in 2015. For connections\nbetween mathematical depth and explanation in mathematics see Lange\n2015c.  \nThe connection between inter-theoretic reduction and explanation is\nfamiliar from philosophy of science. Rantala 1992 and D’Alessandro\n2017 provide two contributions in the case of mathematics. In\nparticular, D’Alessandro claims that the standard reduction of\narithmetic to set theory is non-explanatory but does not exclude that\nother reductions between mathematical theories can be. \nFinally, theorists of style in mathematics and science have emphasized\nthe importance of explanatory arguments for characterizing style. See\nMancosu 2017 for an overview.  \nThe last two decades have witnessed a significant increase of\nattention to mathematical explanation, both in science and\nmathematics. This has led to novel joint work between philosophers of\nscience and philosophers of mathematics. While much has been achieved,\nwe need more detailed case studies in order to understand better the\nvariety of explanatory uses of mathematics in empirical contexts. But\nalready at this stage, the philosophical pay-offs are coming from at\nleast three different directions.  \nFirst, we have a better understanding of the applicability of\nmathematics to the world. Indeed, understanding the\n‘unreasonable effectiveness’ of mathematics in discovering\nand accounting for the laws of the physical world (Wigner 1967,\nSteiner 1998 and 2005, Pincock 2012, Bangu 2012) can only be resolved\nif we understand how mathematics helps in scientific\nexplanation. Second, the study of mathematical explanations of\nscientific facts is extensively being used as a test for theories of\nscientific explanation, in particular those that assume that\nexplanation in natural science is causal explanation. Third, while the\ndebate is still at a standstill, philosophical benefits have also\nemerged in the metaphysical arena by improved exploitation of various\nforms of the indispensability argument. Whether any such argument is\ngoing to be successful remains to be seen but the discussion is\nyielding philosophical benefits in forcing, for instance, the\nnominalist to take a stand on how he can account for the\nexplanatoriness of mathematics in the empirical sciences. In addition,\nmathematical explanation plays a role in theorizing about mathematical\ncoincidences (Lange 2010b, Baker 2009c), an interesting area of\nmetaphysical investigation that had already been developed in the\ncontext of causal phenomena (see Owens 1992). One should also expect\nfuture developments emerging from the interaction of the analysis of\ngrounding and mathematical explanation.   \nAlso in the case of mathematical explanation of mathematical facts, we\nneed to carefully analyze more case studies in order to get a better\ngrasp of the varieties of mathematical explanations. The philosophical\npay-offs of the work on mathematical explanation are coming from the\nfollowing areas. First, mathematical explanation are being used to\ntest models of scientific explanation.  Theories of scientific\nexplanations aim at capturing ‘scientific’ explanations in\nany area of knowledge, not just explanations in the natural\nsciences. If they cannot accommodate mathematical explanations, this\nwill show important limitations of the theories in question. On the\nother hand, if no such theory will be able to encompass mathematical\nexplanations and explanations in natural science under a single model,\nthis might indicate important differences between science and\nmathematics. Secondly, accounting for mathematical explanations of\nscientific facts might be related in interesting ways to an account of\nmathematical explanations of mathematical facts. Third,\n‘explanatoriness’ is only one virtue among those that an\nepistemology of mathematics that does not limit itself to traditional\ndebates about justifying axioms can fruitfully investigate. Indeed, it\nis clear that ‘explanation’ is closely connected to other\nnotions such as ‘generality’,\n‘visualizability’, ‘mathematical\nunderstanding’, ‘purity of methods’,\n‘conceptual fruitfulness’, ‘depth’ etc. The\nepistemological analysis of these important notions informing\nmathematical practice, and the connection among them, has only\nrecently been taken up in earnest (for recent collection in this\ndirection see the volumes Mancosu & others 2005 and Mancosu\n2008a). In conclusion, let me also mention that the topic of\nmathematical explanation has important connections to issues of\nconcern to historians of mathematics and mathematics education (see\nHanna, Jahnke, and Pulte 2010 for a recent volume).","contact.mail":"mancosu@socrates.Berkeley.EDU","contact.domain":"socrates.Berkeley.EDU"}]
