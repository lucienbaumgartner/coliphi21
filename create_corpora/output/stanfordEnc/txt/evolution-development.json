This\ninterest has been increasingly stirred through at least four\ndevelopments since the 1990s: First, through new findings of the\nmolecular genetic mechanisms underlying the development and evolution\nof all morphological forms in multicellular organisms. This discovery\neventually led to the foundation of the new field of evolutionary\ndevelopmental biology (evo-devo). Second, the ability to rapidly\nsequence genes and genomes allowed genetic comparisons to be made\nbetween species. Prior to this, evolutionary genetics was confined to\nallelic differences within a species. Third, new discoveries of\nenvironmentally sensitive channels of extra-genetic transmission of\ninformation between organisms (e.g., epigenetic inheritance and\ntransmission of microbiota) led to attempts to more closely connect\ndevelopment and inheritance, and, as a consequence, evolution. Fourth,\nthe behavioral patterns developed by organisms are increasingly\ndiscussed not only as effects of adaptive processes, but as starting\npoint of evolutionary trajectories. This includes hypotheses\nconceptualizing organisms as agents that co-modify the selective\npressures effecting them (and other species). \n\n\nThese recent trends towards intertwining, rather than separating, the\nconcepts of development and evolution is in contrast to authoritative\nvoices in evolutionary biology (and to a substantial part in\nphilosophy of biology) during most of the twentieth century (see Sapp\n1983; Burian 2004; Amundson 2005). As a consequence of this tradition,\nthis new integration faces a number of conceptual and methodological\nchallenges. In this entry, the focus will be on debates associated\nwith the relationship between development and evolution. Other\ndiscussions about what each of the two components, development and\nevolution, are or how they are (or should be) conceptualized or\nstudied individually is only addressed when relevant to this main\ntopic. \n\nOriginally, the concepts of evolution and development were closely\nconnected. In fact, since the end of the 17th century the\nconcept of ‘evolution’ was widely used to describe\nindividual developmental processes, and ‘developmental\nhypotheses’ often referred to what is now called evolution. In\naddition, development (‘Entwicklung’) was often considered\nto not only describe ontogenetic changes in organisms (Goethe 1790;\nDebraw 1777) but also (what we consider today) phylogenetic changes.\nFor example, Friedrich W.J. Schelling (1798) states that the sequence\nof stages of all organic beings took shape through the gradual\ndevelopment (‘Entwicklung’) of the same organization. This\nsituation changed in the beginning of the 19th century when\nevolution was used by some authors for labeling transgenerational\ntransformations of organisms, among others by Charles Lyell and Georg\nW.F. Hegel. However, in his first edition of his Origin of\nSpecies (1859) Darwin did not use the term evolution, likely\nbecause he wanted to distance his theory from earlier developmental\nunderstandings of the word. Instead, he spoke of ‘descent with\nmodification.’ But especially due to the work of Herbert\nSpencer, evolution became established as a concept that concerns the\n“transformation of species”, and Darwin’s theory of\ntransformation through selection was increasingly seen as the exemplar\nof a “theory of evolution” (Spencer 1852 [1891], 1).\nAccording to this theory, evolution is driven through organisms\n“struggle for existence” (Darwin) and the “survival\nof the fittest” (Spencer). \nBesides this increasing conceptual parting, however, evolution and\ndevelopment were considered to be closely interrelated processes by\nmany scholars throughout the 19th century. By building on\nearlier comparative studies of embryonic processes across various taxa\n(among others by Karl E. von Baer (1827) and Fritz Müller\n(1864)), Ernst Haeckel (1872) argued that all metazoans have the same\nearly stages of development (see Gould 1977). He understood these\ndevelopmental patterns as modifications of a basic type. According to\nthis biogenetic law, the development of individuals is a\nrecapitulation of species’ evolutionary changes: \nDuring the rapid and short course of its individual development, the\norganic individual […] repeats the most important changes of\nform, which its ancestors passed through during their long and slow\ncourse of paleontological development, following the laws of heredity\nand adaptation. (Haeckel 1866, II 300) \nThis relationship, whereby biodiversity progressively arose from\nchanges in development, was already anticipated by Johann F. Meckel\n(1812) and Richard Owen (1837), who parallelized\n‘transmutations’ of embryonic forms and transmutations of\nspecies. Also Darwin (1837) describes the genesis of individuals as a\n‘shortened repetition’ of morphological changes during\nphylogeny. From the end of the 19th century this view of\ndevelopment as a recapitulation of evolution became problematic (see\nRasmussen 1991). First, during this time the view of a linear\nevolution from invertebrates over vertebrates to humans was\nincreasingly questioned. Second, based on comparative studies of cell\nlineages across different taxa in the 1890s, scholars criticized that\nnot only adult organisms but their developmental pathways evolve, too.\nFor example, in 1898, embryologist Edmund B. Wilson (1898) was using\nhomologous patterns of embryonic cell division to unite taxa, while\nembryologist Frank R. Lillie (1898) studied differences in these\npatterns to show the origins of evolutionary adaptations. These\nstudies were (at least to some part) in conflict with Haeckel’s\nrecapitulationism, as they saw ontogeny not as sufficiently explained\nby historical causes, but rather in need of independent mechanistic\nlaws operating on physical properties of the ontogenetic material (see\nGuralnick 2002). In addition, this cell lineage research suggested\nthat Haeckel’s law on the relationship between development and\nevolution should be inverted, as cell lineages evolve over\nevolutionary time. In more general terms, this means that development\ndoes not merely mimic evolution. Rather, it is a source of variation\nand thus a cause of evolution and adaptation: “ontogeny does not\nrecapitulate phylogeny, it creates it” (Garstang 1922: 81). In\nshort, evolution proceeds through modifications of development. \nAnother characteristic of 19th century (and early\n20th century) biology was the lack of a clear conceptual\nparting between developmental and reproductive processes. Especially\nthe idea of the inheritance of acquired characteristics was part of\nthe mainstream of evolutionary thought (Bowler 1983, 2017; Gissis\n& Jablonka 2011). According to Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1809),\nchanges in the structure or function of traits that occurred during an\norganism’s life, depending on their use or disuse, could be\ninherited. Darwin adopted this idea in his inheritance theory of\npangenesis (see Holterhoff 2014). He suggested that all body parts, at\neach developmental stage, contain small particles, so-called\n‘gemmules,’ that were sensitive to environmental changes.\nThese particles accumulate in the reproductive organs and are\ntransmitted to the next generation. Thus, gemmules modified during\ndevelopment lead to modifications in the next generation. Darwin\nstated that due to this close connection of development and\nreproduction, “inheritance must be looked at as merely a form of\ngrowth” (Darwin 1868: II, 404). However, this connection between\ndevelopment and inheritance was increasingly criticized in the first\nhalf of the 20th century. Following August Weismann (1892),\nthe inheritance of environmentally induced variation in somatic cells\n(the body) of organisms was increasingly called into question. In\nsexually reproducing organisms, only the germ plasm used for the sperm\nand eggs were recognized as carrying information that are passed on to\nthe next generation. According to this view, the germ line was immune\nfrom variation occurring in the somatic cells of the body, and thus\nthe inheritance of acquired characteristics or other theories of\nplasmatic inheritance were rejected (but see Harwood 1993, Gilbert\n& Epel 2015).  \nThis parting between development, on the one side, and inheritance and\nevolution, on the other, through Weismann’s theory of\ninheritance, had long lasting effects on how biologists reasoned about\nevolution in the following years. Despite continuing efforts of\nneo-Lamarckians well into the 1930s (Bowler 1983), development\nincreasingly vanished from the landscape of evolutionary theory. By\nuniting Mendel’s laws and new findings in genetics within the\nstatistical framework of population genetics, the modern synthesis\ncame to understand evolution as a change in the frequencies of\ndifferent alleles in a population (Fisher 1930; Dobzhansky 1951).\nVariation relevant to evolution was produced only in the genes of the\ngerm line. These random changes, mutations, were screened off from the\ndevelopmental history of the individual. In the 1940s and 50s this\nview was increasingly manifested, not least through the so-called\n‘central dogma’ of molecular biology (Crick 1958). It\nstates (similar to Weismann’s theory) that information flows\nalways from the DNA to proteins, never vice versa. Thus, phenotypic\nchanges during development could not affect the genes. The trend to\nlink genes with populations in evolutionary explanations, rather than\ndevelopment with evolution reached its climax with the gene’s\neye view of evolution (Williams 1966; Dawkins 1976). By focusing on\nthe question how certain traits like altruistic behaviors could be\nbeneficial, it not only identified genes (rather than organisms) as\nthe sole units of selection. In addition, it described development as\nnothing but the readout of a genetic program (Maienschein 2003;\nPigliucci 2010). Genes control the development of traits and\norganisms’ behaviors, and they replicate to secure their own\nfurther propagation in groups and populations. \nDuring the twentieth century these partings of development and\nevolution let to statements such as: “Problems concerned with\nthe orderly development of the individual are unrelated to those of\nthe evolution of organisms through time” (Wallace 1986: 149).\nHowever, such statements were also targeted by a number of critics.\nFor example, the exclusion of developmental biology from the modern\nsynthesis (Harrison 1937; De Beer 1954; Waddington 1957; Hamburger\n1980), the explanatory autocracy of the adaptationist program in\nevolutionary biology (Gould & Lewontin 1979), and the omission of\na satisfying theory of evolutionary novelty, in which development\nwould play a role (Goldschmidt 1940), have been criticized. Not least\ndue to this rejection of developmental perspectives, evolutionary\ntheory has been blamed to constrain the direction of research in\nevolutionary biology (Provine 1989). In fact, throughout the twentieth\ncentury a number of theories have been put forward, which argue that\ndue to the partial independence of genetic and phenotypic variation,\nevolutionary research should put more emphasis on how the changes in\ndevelopmental and behavioral patterns might drive or bias evolutionary\nchange. This includes cases of ‘canalized’ developmental\npathway which are maintained, even though the genotype or the\nenvironment might have changed to some degree (Waddington 1957; see\nalso Nijhout 2002; Gilbert & Epel 2015; Sultan 2015). In addition,\nstudies of phenotypic plasticity showed that a trait of an organism\ncan react to an environmental input in various ways, and that the\ngenome codes for a wide range of potential phenotypes (Waddington\n1942; Nijhout 1990; Pigliucci 2001). The evolutionary relevance of\nthese findings was emphasized by studies that investigated how the\nrange of variation changes from a plastic trait to a fixed or\ncanalized one over the course of generations (Suzuki and Nijhout 2008;\nWest-Eberhard 2003; B. Baker et al. 2019). What is more, according to\nthe so-called ‘Baldwin effect,’ learned behavioral\npatterns (e.g., the acclimatization to a new stressor) that were\ninitially rather plastic, can affect the reproductive success of\nindividuals and thus, across generations and through natural\nselection, be gradually incorporated into the genetic and epigenetic\nmakeup of a species (Baldwin 1896; Simpson 1953; Piaget 1976 [1978];\nNewman 2002). While some of these developmental perspectives on\nevolution were consistent with the population genetic framework of\nevolutionary biology and were, in fact, gradually incorporated into\nevolutionary thought, others posed more serious challenges for\ntheoretical integration. \nBy building on the latter, more problematic set of approaches\n(especially in recent years), evolutionary theory has been facing\ncalls from developmentally oriented biologists and philosophers of\nbiology to widen the standard explanatory and methodological\napproaches on evolution (Bonner 1958; Alberch 1982; Bonner 1982; Raff\n& Kaufman 1983; Gilbert, Opitz, & Raff 1996; Schlichting &\nPigliucci 1998; West-Eberhard 2003; G. Müller 2007; Pigliucci\n& Müller 2010; Bateson & Gluckman 2011; Jablonka &\nLamb 2014; Laland et al. 2014, 2015; Gilbert & Epel 2015; G. Müller 2017; for discussion, see Huneman\n& Walsh 2017; Fábregas-Tejeda & Vergara-Silva 2018; Baedke et al. 2020b). They argue that evolutionary change should not only or\nprimarily be investigated and explained as a change in genotype\nfrequencies in populations but (also) on the level of the developing\nand acting individual. The underlying idea is that phenotypic\nvariation and the flexibility of organisms’ responses to\nenvironmental cues may introduce non-random variation and thus may\nbias and/or direct morphological evolution to some degree. This\nincludes not only environmentally induced changes in regulatory\nprocesses but also the physical constraints of the developing embryo.\nBy focusing on these phenomena, Kevin Laland and colleagues (2014:\n161) state: “An alternative vision of evolution is beginning to\ncrystallize, in which the processes by which organisms grow and\ndevelop are recognized as causes of evolution”. Others have\nargued that genes are probably more often followers in evolution than\nleaders (West-Eberhard 2003, 2005). In other words, the\nenvironmentally responsive, developing and acting organism takes the\nlead. It introduces in a non-random way new phenotypes into\npopulations that are subsequently stabilized by genes. \nThis ‘development first view’ (or sometimes called\n‘plasticity first view’) of evolution is currently adopted\nespecially by researchers in three fields of research: evolutionary\ndevelopmental biology (evo-devo), epigenetics, and niche construction\ntheory. Evo-devo studies how developmental pathways evolve and, more\nimportant for the above view, how developmental constraints and biases\ncan affect evolutionary trajectories (Raff 1996, 2000; Gerhart &\nKirschner 1997; Love 2003; Amundson 2005; Laubichler & Maienschein\n2007; Sansom & Brandon 2007; G. Müller 2007; Minelli 2009;\nLaubichler 2010; Pigliucci & Müller 2010; Gilbert & Epel\n2015; Moczek et al. 2015; Levis & Pfennig 2020). This includes\nasking how changes in gene regulatory networks cause modifications of\ndevelopmental processes (associated with major shifts in morphological\n‘body plans’) and thus produce evolutionary novelties, or\nwhat capacities organisms have to generate heritable, adaptive\nphenotypic variation and thus to evolve in evolution (i.e. their\nevolvability; see Hendrikse et al. 2007). This focus on how phenotypic\nvariation is produced, rather than how it is selected, is supported by\nstudies in epigenetics on inter- and transgenerational epigenetic\ninheritance (see the entry\n inheritance systems),\n like through the transmission of regulatory factors of gene activity\n(Jablonka & Lamb 1989, 2014, Janlonka & Raz 2009, Perez &\nLehner 2019). Other forms of extra-genetic inheritance include the\ntransmission of microbiota (Gilbert et al. 2012, 2014, Browne et al.\n2017) and behaviorally mediated parental effects (Kappeler &\nMeaney 2010; Rilling & Young 2014). This set of processes contains\nenvironmentally sensitive non-genetic sources of variation for\norganisms that can be transmitted across generations, in many cases\ndecoupled from the transfer of genetic information. Finally, niche\nconstruction theory highlights the self-perpetuating and reciprocal\neffects of organisms, as agents, that construct their own niche\n(and/or that of other species) during development (Lewontin 1982;\nSterelny 2001; Day et al. 2003; Odling-Smee et al. 2003; Laland et al.\n2008, 2009, 2011; Odling-Smee 2010; Chiu & Gilbert 2015, 2020; Aaby & Ramsey forthcoming).\nThese recent studies on developmental evolution will be discussed in\ndetail in section 3. \nThe various developments in the above fields have led to an increasing\nphilosophical interest in conceptual and explanatory issues arising\nfrom the new junction of development and evolution. These include\nclarifying what causal relationships and boundaries exist between the\ntwo realms, which different roles developmental processes play in\nrecent evolutionary research, and how these new roles affect\nontological frameworks of the organism. In addition, these\ndevelopments have been accompanied by debates about the structure of\nexplanations in developmental evolution. Finally, they have informed\ndiscussions on anthropological understandings and ethical questions\nconcerning humans. We will now discuss the debates on these issues in\ndetail.  \nOne of the most central topics of early philosophy of biology in the\n1960s and 1970s was the attempt to develop a suitable conceptual\nframework that would support the parting between development and\nevolution in line with the central assumption of the Modern Synthesis\nthat evolution is a change in the genetic composition of populations\nonly (Dobzhansky 1951: 16; see also Charlesworth et al. 2017). This\nmeans, as a consequence, that development does not (or not in\nsignificant ways) causally effect evolution. Over the decades this\nassumption has been supported by the historically influential\nconceptual distinction between proximate causes and ultimate causes\n(Mayr 1961). \nThe dual framework ‘proximate vs. ultimate’ provides a\nqualitative distinction of biological causality (for related\ndistinctions, see J. Baker 1938; Tinbergen 1951, 1963). It holds that\nbiologists who study proximate causes ask how questions about\nindividual developmental processes. Thus, functional biologists\ninterested in such proximate causes study how systems work. Instead,\nevolutionary biologists that study ultimate causes ask why questions,\nlike why phylogenesis has produced particular evolutionary functions.\nAccording to this distinction, at least on the surface, proximate\ncauses resemble Aristotelian efficient causes while ultimate causes\nresemble Aristotelian final causes. To illustrate this distinction,\nMayr (1961) draws on an example of avian migration. Migration can be\nstudied by asking how bird migrate (i.e., how they develop skills like\nnavigation) or why they migrate (i.e., due to what selective\nadvantage). These two investigations are understood to be both\nimportant and complementary. However, they should be treated as\ndistinct from one another. \nThe proximate-ultimate distinction can be given an epistemic or\nontological reading. First, authors have interpreted it as\ndistinguishing different kinds of explanations (Amundson 2005; Calcott\n2013; Scholl & Pigliucci 2015). This epistemic reading includes\nthat how questions cannot be addressed by explanations citing ultimate\ncauses (i.e., telling a story of adaptation) and that why questions\ncannot be addressed by explanations citing proximate causes (i.e.,\ntelling a story of trait development). Second, authors have\ninterpreted this distinction as one between different ontological\nclasses of causes working in ontogenetic and phylogenetic processes\n(Laland et al. 2013a). This ontological reading is backed up\ntheoretically by Weismann’s concept of the separation of germ\nline and soma, which provides a demarcation line between two distinct\nclasses of causes. To this day, biologists and philosophers have not\nreached a consensus on how exactly the division\n‘proximate-ultimate’ or ‘how-why’ should be\nunderstood, epistemically or ontologically (Francis 1990; Dewsbury\n1992, 1999; Sterelny 1992; Beatty 1994; Ariew 2003). Despite this lack\nof agreement this framework has been applied in various fields, from\nevolutionary biology (E. O. Wilson 1975 [2000: 23]), evolutionary\npsychology (Daly & Wilson 1978; Crawford 1998) and behavioral\necology (Morse 1980: 92–95) to human sciences, like in human\ncooperation (Marchionni & Vromen 2009) and developmental\npsychology (Lickliter & Berry 1990). Especially in evolutionary\nbiology it has contributed to mainstream causal reasoning for a long\ntime, even among evolutionary biologists interested in developmental\nprocesses (see, e.g., Maynard Smith 1982: 6). \nThere has been constant criticism of the proximate-ultimate\ndistinction (since even before Mayr 1961), and against its underlying\nidea to downgrade the explanatory or causal relevance of development\nto evolution. More recently, the discussion of this issue gained pace\nthrough new findings in fields such as epigenetics, evo-devo and niche\nconstruction theory (Thierry 2005; Laland et al. 2011, 2013a, 2013b;\nHaig 2011, 2013; Scott-Phillips et al. 2011; Dickins & Rahman\n2012; Guerrero-Bosagna 2012; Calcott 2013; Dickins & Barton 2013;\nGardner 2013; Mesoudi et al. 2013; Martínez & Esposito\n2014; Scholl & Pigliucci 2015; Baedke 2018; Uller & Laland\n2019). In this context, some scholars argue that the\nproximate-ultimate distinction stands “at the center of some of\ncontemporary biology’s fiercest debates” (Laland et al.\n2011: 1512) about the role of developmental plasticity, niche\nconstruction and inclusive inheritance for evolutionary trajectories.\nParticipants in this debate have argued that we should, due to\ndifferent epistemic or heuristic reasons, keep Mayr’s\nproximate-ultimate distinction (Scott-Phillips et al. 2011; Dickins\n& Barton 2013) or a revised or reinterpreted form of it (Scholl\n& Pigliucci 2015; Otsuka 2015), expand it by a third intermediate\nform of explanations (Haig 2013), or replace it with a concept of\n‘reciprocal causation’ (Laland et al. 2011, 2013a, 2013b,\n2015; Mesoudi et al. 2013). In line with earlier philosophical work\n(Oyama 1985; Keller 2010; Griffiths & Stotz 2013), the latter idea\nof reciprocal causation should allow describing the feedback processes\nbetween causal factors in evolving systems. This includes\norganisms’ capacity of phenotypic plasticity or, more\nspecifically, their activities to alter selection pressures.\nParadigmatic feedback cases are niche construction behaviors of\norganisms that modify their environments and thus shape natural\nselection pressures working on them. In other words, reciprocal\ncausation holds that organisms are not only effects of adaptive\nprocesses, but also causal starting points of evolutionary\ntrajectories. In this sense this framework argues against the causal\nand/or explanatory asymmetry claim of the proximate-ultimate\ndistinction. It highlights the important role of development for\nevolution. \nAgainst this new approach, scholars have argued that reciprocal\ncausation does, in fact, not pose any conceptual challenges for\nevolutionary biology, as it has been included since quite some time\nago in the field (Svennson 2018). A true challenge, however, is to\ndevelop this idea into a methodologically sound framework that allows\nstudying and modeling complex non-linear organism-environment\nrelations. Other have cast doubt on the central causal role the unit\nof the organism is supposed to play in this reciprocity framework\n(Baedke 2019a), or questioned whether this conceptualization can, in\nfact, capture all causal dependency relations of interest for\nevolutionary biology (Martínez & Esposito 2014; Scholl\n& Pigliucci 2015). Moreover, some argued that also this framework\nrelies on the dichotomy between development and evolution (Dickins\n& Barton 2013; Martínez & Esposito 2014) and that it is not conducive to\nsuccessful biological science, as it does not lead to falsifiable\nquestions (Dickins & Rahman 2012) and bleeds proximate and\nultimate explanations into each other so that their distinction\nbecomes meaningless (Gardner 2013; one should mention, however, that\nthis might be the very aim of this approach). More generally, it has\nbeen requested that advocates of this approach should provide more\nconceptual clarifications on what reciprocal causation actually is\nsupposed to mean (Buskell 2019). \nBesides distinguishing development and evolution in a qualitative\nmanner as proximate and ultimate causal processes, a less common\nattempt is to quantitatively distinguish (or relate) the two. Here,\nespecially distinctions based on the rates or time scales on which\ndifferent developmental and biological processes occur have been made\n(see the entry\n levels of organization in biology).\n For example, Conrad H. Waddington (1957) developed a hierarchical\nmodel of time scales that includes biochemical processes on lower\nmolecular levels of organization with a faster rate, medium paced\nprocesses of development on a medium level, and evolutionary processes\non higher levels with a slower rate. According to such a view,\nevolutionary processes are simply processes occurring with a different\nrate and thus at a different level than developmental ones. Thus, they\ndiffer gradually rather than in kind. Rate-based distinctions have\nbeen described to be consistent with the ultimate-proximate framework\n(when interpreting it as one that distinguishes different timescales\nof phenotypic change; see Francis 1990; Haig 2013) or as different\nfrom proximate-ultimate distinctions (Baedke & Mc Manus 2018). In\naddition, time-scale (or size-scale) conceptualizations have been\napplied for developing methodologies and multi-scale modeling that\nintegrate, among others, developmental and evolutionary processes (S.\nLevin 1992; Green & Batterman 2017; Duckworth 2019). \nThe idea that evolution constitutes changing developmental\nrelationships is central for the field of evolutionary developmental\nbiology (evo-devo). The field describes itself as the science that\nstudies how alterations in development create the variations that\nnature can select (Raff & Kaufman 1983; Gilbert, Opitz, & Raff\n1996). In other words, natural selection did not create variation;\ndevelopment creates variation. Development is the artist; natural\nselection is the curator (Gilbert 2006, 2019). Both have creative\nagency; but they are working at different levels. Although this view\nhad been expressed by scientists such as Thomas Huxley, Julian Huxley,\nConrad H. Waddington, and Richard B. Goldschmidt, it gained credence\nthrough more recent discoveries that explained how normal development\ncould occur. Chief among these discoveries was the explication of\ndevelopmental pathways that connected embryonic induction with gene\nexpression. Here, paracrine factors (proteins that influence the\nbehaviors or gene expression patterns of neighboring cells) secreted\nby one set of cells were received by receptors on the membranes of\nother cells. These receptors then activated proteins within the\ncytoplasm, which eventually activated or repressed proteins that entered\nthe nucleus to regulate transcription of particular genes. \nThe second major discovery that promoted evo-devo was the discovery of\nmodular enhancers. The above-mentioned transcription factors would\nbind to specific regions of DNA, called enhancers. Most genes have\nmultiple enhancers. Thus, a gene might have a ‘limb’\nenhancer that activates the expression of the gene in the limb, and an\n‘eye’ enhancer that enables the expression of the gene in\nthe eye. Moreover, each enhancer usually binds several transcription\nfactors and could be activated in Boolean <and> or <or>\nfashion. Evolution could occur by creating or deleting enhancers,\nthereby enabling genes to be expressed differently in different\nspecies. King and Wilson (1975) and Jacob (1977) had speculated that\nevolution occurred by changes in gene regulation. This provided a\nmodel for such regulation, and some of the best examples are seen in\nthe divergence of humans from other apes (Geschwind & Konopka\n2012; Pollard et al. 2006). As Haraway (2008) noted, “relationships are the smallest\npossible pattern for analysis”, and the relation between\nenhancer and transcription factor may indicate the ‘natural\nkinds’ of the biological world (Gilbert & Bard 2014).\nMoreover, the entities defined by enhancer/transcription factor\ninteractions during development are often unexpected and do not mirror\nintuitive boundaries between entities in adults. Activation of genes\nto form the distal rib, for instance, is controlled by a different\nenhancer than that which activates genes in the proximal rib (Guenther\net al. 2008). \nThese differences in gene expression could be categorized into four\ncategories (Arthur 2004). One of these categories involves the\nplace of gene expression, where different populations of\ncells express a particular gene in different species. For instance,\nthe gremlin gene in the duck hindlimb webbing protects these\ncells from cell death, enabling webbed feet (Laufer et al, 1997;\nMerino et al. 1999). A second category involves changes in the\ntiming of gene expression, as in the continued expression of\nthe fgf8 gene at the tip of the dolphin forelimbs, thus\nenabling the extension of its flippers (Richardson &\nOelschläger 2002). A third category of change involves\nalterations in the magnitude of gene expression, as in the\ndifferences in Bmp4 gene expression that determine the width\nof finch beaks (Abzhanov et al. 2004). A fourth category focuses on\nthe alterations of the actual protein sequence of regulatory\nproteins, as in the changes of the Antennapedia gene in\ninsects, which restrict insects from forming more than six limbs\n(Galant and Carroll 2002). \nThe third discovery was the elucidation of gene regulatory networks\n(GRNs). A GRN is based on paracrine factors, signal transduction\ncascades, and transcription factors. While ignoring\npost-transcriptional gene regulation, this concept attempts to explain\nhow initial conditions (RNAs and proteins within the oocyte, position\nof the embryo within the uterus, etc.) could create the conditions\nwhereby cell types differ, even though their genomes are identical.\nSpearheaded by Eric Davidson (2001, 2006), this approach uses systems\ntheory concepts such as modularity and dissociability to explain how\nthe genes interact in a hierarchical manner to produce different\ncell types (Levine & Davidson 2005) and how the cell types in\nrelated species could differ by the recruitment (co-option) of a\nparticular GRN by altering transcription factor binding. More\ngenerally, the discovery of GRNs has enabled the integration of\ndevelopmental biology with paleontology (Jablonski 2017; Hinman et al.\n2003; Hinman & Cheatle Jarvela 2014) and may also be extended into\nareas of symbiosis and niche construction (Laubichler & Renn\n2015). \nA fourth discovery of evolutionary developmental biology was the\nimportance of developmental plasticity for evolution (Nijhout 1990;\nGilbert 2001; Pigliucci 2001). By the end of the 20th century, the\nroles of temperature, sunlight, diet, crowding, maternal behaviors,\nand predation were seen to have major roles in effecting phenotypes in\nplants and animals. Thus, the environment not only selected\nvariations, it helped produce them. Since evo-devo postulated that\nchanges in development cause evolution, and since developmental\nplasticity played a role in development, then it became necessary to\nlook at changes in plasticity as being part of evolution. In the early\nyears of the 21st century, developmental plasticity was seen to play\nroles in evolutionary change (West-Eberhard 2003; Abouheif et al.\n2014; Suzuki & Nijhout 2006; Rajakumar et al. 2018; Levis &\nPfennig 2020), and the notion of ‘plasticity-first\nevolution’ (or ‘development-first evolution’)\nintegrated data from numerous sources into a program where the\nphysiological ability to alter one’s phenotype due to\nenvironmental agents could become canalized and genetically fixed by\nselection. The mechanisms by which such plasticity-first evolution was\neffected (unmasking and selection of cryptic genetic variants,\nstress-related inability of molecular chaperones to allow proper\nfolding of mutant proteins, etc.) became a new research program. \nA fifth discovery was the realization that one of the major\nenvironmental agents effecting development were symbiotic microbes\n(McFall-Ngai 2002; Gilbert et al. 2012, 2015). The notion of the\nholobiont (i.e. an integrated composite organism composed of microbial\nand host eukaryotic species) organized much of the data to look at the\nroles of microbes in causing both the normal development of the\norganism and variations of normal development (in disease and\nevolution) (Rosenberg & Zilber-Rosenberg 2016; see entry\n biological individuals).\n For instance, in the mouse, the normal development of the immune\nsystem and the gut capillary network depends upon specific bacteria\nobtained during birth. These bacteria induce the expression of\nparticular genes in the eukaryotic cells, and the proteins made by\nthese genes influence cell fate (Hooper et al. 2001; McFall-Ngai et\nal. 2013). In other words, the bacteria can act as an embryonic cell\nwould, regulating gene expression in neighboring cells. Here, the\neukaryotic organism needs and expects these bacteria to be present for\nnormal development. \nAs in the other cases of developmental plasticity, the next step was\nto see if changes in developmental symbionts could produce changes in\nevolution (see O'Malley 2015). It was shown that changes in symbionts could provide\nselectable variants for evolution (Zhang et al. 2019), and it could\nprovide the basis for reproductive isolation through cytoplasmic\nincompatibility or mating preference (Brucker & Bordenstein 2013;\nSharon et al. 2010). One of the most interesting possibilities,\nthough, comes from the view that most, if not all, eukaryotic\norganisms are holobionts, and that symbionts open new evolutionary\ntrajectories. Symbiotic microbes, for instance, have long been known\nto be responsible for the plant-digesting enzymes in the stomachs of\nruminants. Without cellulose-digesting bacteria, cows cannot digest\ngrass or grain. Moreover, the microbes help create the rumen after\nthey colonize the digestive system at birth. Thus, these microbes also\ninduce the formation of the organ that houses them, and allows them to\nfunction (Gilbert 2020; Chiu & Gilbert 2020). Developmental\nsymbiosis (sympoiesis) thus has opened evolutionary trajectories for\ncertain mammals. This is an example of both developmental symbiosis\nand niche construction. Niche construction depends on developmental\nplasticity (Laland et al. 2008). \nThese five new (or renewed) aspects of developmental biology have\nseveral philosophical implications. Among others, they concern\nontological questions of what developing organisms are and how they\nshould be explained from an integrated perspective of developmental\nevolution. \nMany ontological debates on the relation between development and\nevolution focus on the organism as the central unit, which both\ndevelops and evolves, in contrast to, for example, genes or\npopulations. Several theories have tried to clarify the nature of this\norganismic unit: According to one influential view, the organism is a\nseries of integrated processes during a life cycle (Bonner 1965;\nNicholson & Dupré 2018; Fusco 2019a; DiFrisco 2019), with\ncomplex and reciprocal relationships between the whole organism and\nits parts (Gilbert & Sarkar 2000; Esposito 2016; Peterson 2017).\nCentral elements of this view are based on an organicist framework\ndeveloped by Kant, which states that in organisms “the parts,\nwith respect to both form and being, are only possible through their\nrelationship to the whole” and “that the parts bind\nthemselves mutually into the unity of a whole in such a way that they\nare mutually cause and effect of one another” (Kant 1790/1793\n[1902: 373]; see also Lenoir 1982). Haraway (2008) highlights the\nlatter idea of reciprocal interaction between organisms’ parts\nby saying: “Reciprocal induction is the name of the game”\n(2008: 228) and it is “reciprocating complexity all the way\ndown” (2008: 42). These ideas of life cycle integration and\nubiquitous reciprocity suggest a more processual and organism-centered\nontological perspective on the organism. This view is becoming\nimportant in studies of evolution. For example, in order to understand\nhow nervous systems evolve one need to consider that the nervous\nsystem of the developing organism has different functions than the\nadult nervous system and may be used to coordinate body construction\nas it develops (M. Levin 2019; Fields et al. 2020). That developing\nsystems show exaptation and competition and that evolving systems show\ncooperation has allowed Fields and Levin (forthcoming) to suggest that\ndevelopmental and evolutionary processes can be integrated on a\nscale-free level through the language of information processing and\ncommunication. \nA second ontological consideration states that developing and evolving\norganisms are integrated collective individuals, so-called holobionts\nor ‘meta-organisms’ (Zilber-Rosenberg & Rosenberg\n2008; Bosch & McFall-Ngai 2011; Gilbert, Sapp, & Tauber 2012;\nsee also O'Malley 2017; Baedke et al. 2020a). Therefore, our\ndiscussions about evolution must take into consideration that each\norganism is a consortium having numerous genomes, not just one, as\ntraditionally assumed. Mathematical modeling of the evolution of\nholobionts that take this diversity into consideration is just\nbeginning (Roughgarden et al. 2018; Osmanovic et al. 2018; Roughgarden\n2020). This new ontological framework states that symbiosis is the\nnorm; it is not peripheral. These symbionts can act at different\nstages of the life cycle and are seen to scaffold development\n(Griesemer 2014; Chiu & Gilbert 2015; Minelli 2016). In\n‘scaffolding,’ each developmental stage is made possible\nby entities and processes that catalyze these activities, which allows\nnovel and evolutionary relevant processes to occur at lower\ndifficulties and costs. \nA third ontological point concerns the exact nature of the link\nbetween development and evolution. Two approaches have been put\nforward: One draws on the idea that the biological entity that is\ncausally efficacious in both realms can only be found on the level of\nintegrated collectives of symbiotic interactions. Following in the\ntradition of Leibnitz’ notion of compossibility as well as\nMargulis’ (1999) claim that we live on a ‘symbiotic\nplanet,’ this view argues that symbiotic collectives are not\nonly essential units of development but also of evolution. This leads\nto a view of evolution that is not centered on interspecies conflict\nand competition between individuals (Huxley 1888; Williams 1966;\nDawkins 1976). Instead the entities that evolve are cooperative\nco-developing collectives (Rosenberg & Zilber-Rosenberg 2016;\nRoughgarden et al. 2018; for discussion, see Peacock 2011;\nSuárez 2018). \nA different ontological framework links\ndevelopment and evolution through the entity of the acting organism\n(Nicholson 2014, 2018; Walsh 2015; for discussion, see Pradeu 2016;\nBaedke 2019a, 2019b). These approaches usually are less related to\nsymbiosis research than to studies on niche construction or maternal\neffects. Here the organism (e.g., a beaver that builds a dam or an\nearthworm that processes the soil) is constructed as a self-determined\nagent that through its behavior modulates the selection pressures\nacting on it (Odling-Smee et al. 2003; Uller & Helanterä\n2019). Thus, so the argument goes, it can bias and direct population\ndynamics. The holobiont perspective and the niche construction\nperspective join together when one appreciates that the microbes and\nthe host form each other’s environment. Here, the host and the\nmicrobes scaffold each other’s development and evolution (Chiu\n& Gilbert 2015, 2020).  \nWhether or not we consider collectives or organismic individual agents\nas the core entities partaking both in development and evolution,\nattempts to integrate the two realms have to show in each case that,\nin fact, it is the same unit that develops and evolves. In\nother words, if we want to unify development and evolution through the\nunit of the biological individual (being the one entity that partakes\nin both) this unit needs to meet criteria of both physiological (e.g.,\nmetabolic) and evolutionary individuality (see the entry on\n  biological individuals).\nEvolutionary individuals have been traditionally conceptualized as\nreproductive units with differential fitness and shared lineages\n(so-called ‘Darwinian individuals’; see Godfrey-Smith\n2009) or as units of selection (‘interactors’; see Hull\n1980). Unfortunately, both of these units do not always coincide\n(Godfrey-Smith 2013; Pradeu 2016). For example, some organisms (holobionts) form developing\nbut no reproductive units, as they include a multitude of lineages\n(e.g., microbial ones). Other possible units of selection (like genes\nor populations) are not identical with physiological individuals.\nThus, a physiological individual may not necessarily be an\nevolutionary unit or vice versa. \nThis brings us to a fourth ontological point: developmental\nplasticity, which is considered to bias or even guide evolutionary\ntrajectories (West-Eberhard 2003; Radersma et al. forthcoming). The\nconcept of plasticity states that development can be regulated in\nimportant ways by the environment. This rules out genetic determinism\n(but not necessarily environmental determinism; see Waggoner and Uller\n2015). In the original conception of phenotype production (i.e.,\ndevelopment), Wilhelm Johannsen (1909) had pointed out that the phenotype\nis the product of both the genotype and environmental circumstance, and\nWoltereck (1909; see also Sarkar 1999) argued that what was inherited\nis the “Reaktionsnorm”, a potential to generate\nphenotypic variations in response to environmental agents. In line with this view, many\nembryology texts in the late 1800s (e.g., Hertwig 1894) had promulgated the\nperspective that development demanded both the interactions between\nembryonic cells and the further interactions of those cells with the\nenvironment (see Nyhart 1995). \nDespite this history, developmental plasticity was marginalized as\ngenetic explanations came to the fore in the mid-20th century (Sarkar\n1998; Keller 2002). Against this background, embryologists such as\nLewis Wolpert (1994) could ask whether an organism’s phenotype\ncould be computed if we had the total description of the egg. Due to\nthe above findings on organism-environment interaction (see section\n3), a different view emerged that more seriously considers the\nenvironmental-responsiveness and plasticity of the developing\nphenotype. This view includes a shift from externalist to internalist\nor constructionist understandings of the organism-environment\nrelationship (Godfrey-Smith 1996). While the externalist view –\nthe orthodox view in evolutionary theory – conceptualizes\nproperties of organisms as a result of their environments (i.e.\nnatural selection targeting genetic programs), the internalist view\nsees “one set of organic properties in terms of other internal\nor intrinsic properties of the organic system” (Godfrey-Smith\n1996: 30). According to these two accounts, organisms occupy an\nenvironment that covaries with them or that is largely independent of\ntheir variation. The above research in developmental evolution\nsuggests a switch from an externalist to a constructionist\nperspective, in which the organism actively molds its internal states\nand responds to and alters its external environment (see Laland et al.\n2014, 2015). In addition, in this framework also the causal role of\nthe environment becomes more complex. It now includes the idea that\nthe environment has active agency that can determine the phenotype.\nRather than conceptualizing the environment as nothing but a passive\nfilter for evolution, in this view the environment plays a role in\nactuating the phenotype in addition to selecting it (Moczek 2015;\nGilbert & Epel 2015). \nBesides these discussions about the ontology of developing and\nevolving organisms, other central philosophical debates on the\ninterface between development and evolution have targeted the topic of\nscientific explanation. This refers to the questions of what studies\nof developmental evolution (should) explain and how they explain.  \nPhilosophers of science have long argued for the explanatory autonomy\nof biological explanations. Especially, they have criticized\nunderstanding biological explanation as similar to law-based accounts\nof explanations in physics (see Lange 2007). In contrast, scholars\nhave argued that explanation in the biosciences often includes\ndescribing a mechanism that brings about a certain biological\nphenomenon (Bechtel & Richardson 1993; Craver 2007; Bechtel &\nAbrahamsen 2010; see also entry\n mechanisms in science).\n Especially evo-devo has been described as a paradigmatic mechanistic\nscience, which – against the ultimate-proximate distinction\n– seeks to identify developmental mechanisms that can explain\nevolutionary change in phenotypes (Gilbert 2003; Hall 2012). This\nmechanistic approach is often flanked by mathematical models of\nvarious developmental patterns, from changes in gene regulatory\nnetworks to growth patterns of organisms, and by historical narratives\non how organisms and species evolve (Jaeger & Sharpe 2014; Winther\n2015). However, besides the accepted centrality of mechanistic\nexplanation for developmental evolution, a much-debated topic concerns\nwhat exactly a developmental mechanism is and how it functions in\nevolutionary explanation compared to standard explanations citing\nnatural selection.  \nPhilosophers of biology (in the so-called new mechanistic philosophy)\nhave conceptualized mechanistic explanations in biology as the\nconstruction of models of mechanisms that connect parts of systems,\nlocated on one level of organization, with behaviors of the whole\nsystem, usually located on a higher level of organization (Machamer et\nal. 2000; Craver 2007; Illari & Williamson 2012). In this\nframework, mechanistic models relate different compositional levels of\norganization, like genes and phenotypes or cells and tissues. These\ninter-level relations exist between causal capacities of parts of a\nsystem and their organization and the capacities of a system as a\nwhole. Such relations are established following a procedure of\ndecomposition and localization (Bechtel & Richardson 1993; Craver\n2007; Menzies 2012). This conceptual framework to describe biological\nmechanisms and mechanistic explanation has been developed based on\ncase studies in molecular and cell biology. However, scholars have\ncast doubt on whether it is also useful to describe mechanistic\nexplanations in studies of development and developmental\nevolution. \nWith respect to development, it has been argued, first, that\norganization plays a different role in mechanistic developmental\nexplanations (Mc Manus 2012). In contrast to the above framework,\nwhich usually presupposes that levels of organization are simply\nthere, and thus it does not have to clarify how levels of organization\nactually originate, the origin of levels and other forms of\norganization (e.g., spatial axes) are specifically addressed in\nmechanistic developmental explanations. Second, philosophers have\nargued that the relations between levels traced by developmental\nmechanisms are not exhausted by the synchronic, constitutive relations\nbetween parts and wholes, as some new mechanists suggest (Craver &\nBechtel 2007). In contrast, developmental explanations trace changing\ndiachronic relationships between causal capacities of a system at\ndifferent levels of organization at different time intervals (Ylikoski\n2013; Baedke & Mc Manus 2018; Baedke 2020; see also Love &\nHüttemann 2011). Third, it has been argued that explanations in\nevo-devo using developmental mechanisms face a challenge due to the\nheterogeneity of these mechanisms (Love 2018). When trying to\nintegrate two types of explanations of developmental mechanisms\n– explanations of highly conserved molecular genetic mechanisms,\nlike gene regulatory networks, and explanations of cellular-physical\nmechanisms, like cell migration – sometimes a tradeoff emerges.\nRather than allowing a more complete explanation, integrating the two\nmechanisms may lead to a less general explanation, since\nnon-phylogenetically conserved cellular-physical mechanisms yield less\ngenerality in explanations. This tradeoff can introduce an explanatory\nbias to projects that seek to integrate development and evolution. It\ncould lead researchers to favors the generality of explanations, which\ncite highly conserved molecular genetic mechanisms and no\ncellular-physical mechanisms, over integrated explanations citing both\nkinds of mechanisms. \nWith respect to the concept of mechanism in developmental evolution,\nBrigandt (2015) highlights that some mechanistic explanations in\nevo-devo – like those on how development biases evolution\n(Radersma et al. forthcoming), how novel variation arises through\ndevelopmental plasticity (Pigliucci 2001, Gilbert 2006), and how\norganisms generate heritable, adaptive phenotypic variation\n(evolvability; see Brown 2014) – significantly expand the\nstandard analysis of decomposition and localization by dynamical\nmodels (see also Bechtel & Abrahamsen 2010; Brigandt 2013; Baedke\n2020). These models allow predicting the dynamics of developing\nsystems. After decomposing a system and identifying causal\ncontributions of parts or sub-systems, dynamical models help to\ndemonstrate how these contributions operate together to bring about a\nwhole system’s behavior. In this way, they answer how\ndevelopmental mechanisms create evolutionary relevant qualitative\nchanges in phenotypic properties, like robustness, phenotypic\nplasticity, and modularity, through underlying quantitative changes in\ntheir component parts and activities. One classical example of this\nare mathematical models on the robustness of spatial pattering and\nsegmentation in Drosophila. They provide quantitative\ninformation about the interaction of underlying gene network\ncomponents, including, for example, gene transcription rates and decay\nrates of gene products (von Dassow et al. 2000). \nOther discussions on the interface between development and evolution\nfocus on the structure of explanations that address how developmental\nmechanisms evolve. Calcott (2009, 2013) has argues that Mayr’s\ndistinction characterizes two kinds of explanation: developmental\nexplanation that answers ‘How do individuals work\nat a time?’ and evolutionary explanation that answers\n‘How do populations change over time?’\nHowever, there is a third kind, called ‘lineage\nexplanation’. Lineage explanation differs from the above by\nanswering ‘How do individuals change over\ntime?’ Therefore, they offer a series of mechanistic\nmodels, which trace differences between the developmental mechanisms\nof individuals that produce the relevant morphological structures at\ndifferent times. Over evolutionary time, these relations undergo small\nmodifications, which ultimately bring about novelties, like eyes and\nfeathers, in the whole system. Thus, lineage explanation expands the\nstandards philosophical framework from a single description of a\nmechanism into a series of mechanistic models. \nBesides these debates about the structure of biological mechanisms and\ntheir role in explaining developmental evolution, philosophers of\nbiology and biologists have discussed, more generally, which virtue\ndevelopmental explanations (could) have for addressing evolutionary\nphenomena. Related to this issue is the question how much – in\nthe sense of what kind of facts – natural selection alone can\nexplain (see the entry\n adaptationism).\n It is widely accepted that such explanations can address the general\ndynamics of trait frequencies and survival (see Sober 1984). However,\nwhether this also holds for addressing in more detail the development\nof particular traits of individuals is an unsettled issue. While some\nauthors claim that evolutionary explanations by natural selection can\nexplain why a particular individual has a certain trait rather than\nanother trait (Neander 1995; Forber 2005) others deny this (Sober\n1984; Stegmann 2010). What is more, it has been argued that\nintegrating explanations of developmental phenomena, like\ndevelopmental bias, phenotypic plasticity, niche construction, and inclusive inheritance, to the explanatory framework of evolutionary\ntheory would lead to a “significantly expanded explanatory\ncapacity” of this theory (Pigliucci & Müller 2010: 12).\nHowever, while there is often agreement in evolutionary biology over\nthe existence of these developmental phenomena (Laland et al. 2014;\nWray et al. 2014), their explanatory relevance is questioned. Against\nthis background, scholars have begun analyzing based on which criteria\nof explanatory power, like precision, proportionality, sensitivity,\nand idealization, developmentalist evolutionary explanations are\nbetter than selectionist explanations. This includes identifying,\nwhich tradeoffs between explanatory standards (e.g., between precision\nand sensitivity or idealization) those accounts face that seek to\nintegrate developmental and evolutionary explanations (Baedke et al.\n2020b; Uller et al. 2020). \nThe above debates about the relationship between evolution and\ndevelopment primarily emerged within philosophy of science, especially\nin history and philosophy of biology. However, there are other, more\ngeneral debates about anthropological and ethical issues that concern\ndevelopmental evolution. The primarily refer to how we conceptualize\ndeveloping and evolving humans, their life, body and health, as well\nas how we assign responsibilities for health care interventions. \nFirst, new findings in the plasticity of developing organism, their\ninterconnectedness, and modes of transgenerational transmission of\ninformation have affected scientific and public understandings of what\nhumans are. For example, if humans are conceptualized as holobionts\n– as collectives of co-developing and co-evolving organisms\n– this also means that development is a matter of\nco-construction, of interactions between species. It means, as Haraway\n(2016) has phrased it, that we – as humans – very\nliterally ‘become with others.’ In this context,\nsympoiesis (developmental symbiosis) means that development is\nco-development. Against this background, John Dupré and Maureen\nO'Malley (2009) see living entities as interactive collections:\n“Life, we claim, is typically found at the collaborative\nintersections of many lineages, and we even suggest that collaboration\nshould be seen as a central characteristic of living\nmatter”. \nSecond, biological and biophilosophical debates on developmental\nevolution and organisms’ plasticity and environmental\nresponsiveness have informed debates on what the human body is. For\nexample, Jörg Niewöhner (2011) states that a new concept of\nthe human body is currently emerging in modern biology, the so-called\n‘embedded body’. According to this view, the human body is\nno longer a machine-like unit, which is genetically programmed,\nneurally controlled and bounded by the skin, but an open and dynamic\nunit which cannot be grasped in isolation from its material and social\nenvironment (see also Baedke 2017). Additionally, the body is embedded\ninto different time scales ranging from its evolutionary and\ntransgenerational to ontogenetic past, which permanently constitute\nits present. Others have argued, against the standard human birth\nnarrative and Aristotle, who defined the temporal boundaries of\nindividuals at birth and death, that birth in humans is not the\ncreation of a new individual. Instead, birth should be understood as\nthe origin of a new multi-species collective (Gilbert 2014; Chiu &\nGilbert 2015). \nAnother anthropological issue arising from recent research in evo-devo\nand epigenetics is, third, the question how to define normality and\nhealth in humans (see Baedke 2019b). There is evidence that bacteria\nare needed for our normal cognitive and social development. For\nexample, germ-free mice are asocial and have autistic-like behavior\n(Desbonnet et al. 2014) and this behavior can be replicated by\nimplanting the microbiome from autistic patients (but not control\npatients) into germ-free mice (Sharon et al. 2019). Such cases suggest\nthat biological normality is not as intrinsic property to organisms\nbut emerges through interconnections with other organisms and the\nenvironment. In addition, our understanding of health is increasingly\nchallenged. This especially refers to the view that describes human\nhealth as freedom and autonomy from external interference. It usually\nsees bacteria as deviations from the norm and parasitism as\npathological, because it threatens and contaminates the purity of the\nindividual’s energy pattern. Instead, in a (more processual)\nholobiontic framework, microbes are needed for normal development and\nare thought to prevent the development of certain diseases (Bello et\nal. 2018; Kirjavainen et al. 2019). In addition, certain entities,\nbacteria or viruses, previously thought to be harmful, are now\nincreasingly considered to be ‘good’ or\n‘healthy’ collaborators, not ‘bad intruders’\n(Dupré & Guttinger 2016). In more general term, this means\nthat since microbiota are increasingly recognized as important\ncomponents that stabilize normal development and co-evolve with\nhumans, they therefore carry traits crucial for humans’ fitness,\ni.e., health. This new perspective could lead to radical changes in\npersonalized surveillance and treatment of disease, and, more\ngenerally, to new strategies in policy making, which replace the idea\nof preserving the autonomous individual from contamination by the idea\nof maintaining (equilibrium states of) collectives of co-developing\nand co-evolving individuals. \nFinally, on a more ethical dimension, these findings about\nhumans’ openness to their environments and to one another has\nled, first, to discussions about who takes responsibilities for\nhumans’ health states and interventions (e.g., on epigenomes and\nmicrobiomes) on intra- and transgenerational timescales (Dupras &\nRavitsky 2016). If plastic development can shape evolution, who is\nresponsible for developmental outcomes and evolutionary trajectories\nin humans? Should the individual being as the central heath care\nagent, which is ‘freed from the chains of its genes’\n(Pickersgill et al. 2013), take this responsibility? Or should\ncollectives, such as national states or international bodies, be\nresponsible for levels of toxins in the environment as well as for the\nfood individuals eat and stress they are exposed to (Hedlund 2012)?\nThe latter account of responsibility aims to prevent overemphasizing\nthe causal role of mothers as the most central public health care\nagents who should be held accountable (and guilty) if their children\nor later generations become sick (Richardson et al. 2014). \nThe relationship between evolution and development has been a long\ndebated topic in the history of biology and philosophy of biology.\nThis entry has sampled a small portion of work relevant to the\nconceptual, epistemological, anthropological and ethical reflections\non this relationship. Besides the issues discussed here, philosophers\nof biology and biologists have discussed how developmental and\nphylogenetic approaches to homology can be integrated (Amundson 2004;\nWagner 2014; DiFrisco 2019; see the entry\n developmental biology),\n what model organisms (Love 2009; Lloyd et al. 2012; Minelli & Baedke 2014; Zuk et al.\n2014; see entry\n developmental biology)\n and representational tools scientists (should) use for studying\nrelationships between evolution and development (e.g., normal plates,\ncell fate maps, epigenetic landscapes) and what the epistemic and\nheuristic roles of these tools in scientific practice are (see Haraway\n1976; Gilbert 1991; Hopwood 2007; Love 2010; Baedke 2013; Baedke &\nSchöttler 2017; Nicoglou 2018). In addition, long standing\ndebates on teleology in biology (see the entry\n teleological notions in biology)\n drew on the relation between evolution and development to distinguish\nthe teleological dimension of development from non-teleological\nevolutionary processes (Mayr 1961), to introduce new conceptual\nframeworks, like teleonomy, which refer to only apparently purposeful\nsystems (Pittendrigh 1958), or to highlight the purposeful acting\norganismic agent as a starting point to reason about the teleological\nnature of evolution (Russell 1950; Piaget 1976 [1978]; Walsh\n2015). \nAt the moment, philosophical debates about the appropriate conceptual\nand explanatory approach to combine or integrate developmental and\nevolutionary processes have not reached a consensus. This is not least\ndue to the fact that the relevant disciplinary fields, such as\nevo-devo, epigenetics and niche construction theory, which foster such\nintegration, are still relatively young. Their theoretical and\nconceptual frameworks are highly heterogeneous. Thus, important aims\nfor future philosophical research is to understand obstacles for the\nstabilization and solidification of these frameworks, to identify\ntheir explanatory virtues and limitations, as well as to call\nattention to their effects on how we understand humans and human\nhealth.

This\ninterest has been increasingly stirred through at least four\ndevelopments since the 1990s: First, through new findings of the\nmolecular genetic mechanisms underlying the development and evolution\nof all morphological forms in multicellular organisms. This discovery\neventually led to the foundation of the new field of evolutionary\ndevelopmental biology (evo-devo). Second, the ability to rapidly\nsequence genes and genomes allowed genetic comparisons to be made\nbetween species. Prior to this, evolutionary genetics was confined to\nallelic differences within a species. Third, new discoveries of\nenvironmentally sensitive channels of extra-genetic transmission of\ninformation between organisms (e.g., epigenetic inheritance and\ntransmission of microbiota) led to attempts to more closely connect\ndevelopment and inheritance, and, as a consequence, evolution. Fourth,\nthe behavioral patterns developed by organisms are increasingly\ndiscussed not only as effects of adaptive processes, but as starting\npoint of evolutionary trajectories. This includes hypotheses\nconceptualizing organisms as agents that co-modify the selective\npressures effecting them (and other species). \n\n\nThese recent trends towards intertwining, rather than separating, the\nconcepts of development and evolution is in contrast to authoritative\nvoices in evolutionary biology (and to a substantial part in\nphilosophy of biology) during most of the twentieth century (see Sapp\n1983; Burian 2004; Amundson 2005). As a consequence of this tradition,\nthis new integration faces a number of conceptual and methodological\nchallenges. In this entry, the focus will be on debates associated\nwith the relationship between development and evolution. Other\ndiscussions about what each of the two components, development and\nevolution, are or how they are (or should be) conceptualized or\nstudied individually is only addressed when relevant to this main\ntopic. \n\nOriginally, the concepts of evolution and development were closely\nconnected. In fact, since the end of the 17th century the\nconcept of ‘evolution’ was widely used to describe\nindividual developmental processes, and ‘developmental\nhypotheses’ often referred to what is now called evolution. In\naddition, development (‘Entwicklung’) was often considered\nto not only describe ontogenetic changes in organisms (Goethe 1790;\nDebraw 1777) but also (what we consider today) phylogenetic changes.\nFor example, Friedrich W.J. Schelling (1798) states that the sequence\nof stages of all organic beings took shape through the gradual\ndevelopment (‘Entwicklung’) of the same organization. This\nsituation changed in the beginning of the 19th century when\nevolution was used by some authors for labeling transgenerational\ntransformations of organisms, among others by Charles Lyell and Georg\nW.F. Hegel. However, in his first edition of his Origin of\nSpecies (1859) Darwin did not use the term evolution, likely\nbecause he wanted to distance his theory from earlier developmental\nunderstandings of the word. Instead, he spoke of ‘descent with\nmodification.’ But especially due to the work of Herbert\nSpencer, evolution became established as a concept that concerns the\n“transformation of species”, and Darwin’s theory of\ntransformation through selection was increasingly seen as the exemplar\nof a “theory of evolution” (Spencer 1852 [1891], 1).\nAccording to this theory, evolution is driven through organisms\n“struggle for existence” (Darwin) and the “survival\nof the fittest” (Spencer). \nBesides this increasing conceptual parting, however, evolution and\ndevelopment were considered to be closely interrelated processes by\nmany scholars throughout the 19th century. By building on\nearlier comparative studies of embryonic processes across various taxa\n(among others by Karl E. von Baer (1827) and Fritz Müller\n(1864)), Ernst Haeckel (1872) argued that all metazoans have the same\nearly stages of development (see Gould 1977). He understood these\ndevelopmental patterns as modifications of a basic type. According to\nthis biogenetic law, the development of individuals is a\nrecapitulation of species’ evolutionary changes: \nDuring the rapid and short course of its individual development, the\norganic individual […] repeats the most important changes of\nform, which its ancestors passed through during their long and slow\ncourse of paleontological development, following the laws of heredity\nand adaptation. (Haeckel 1866, II 300) \nThis relationship, whereby biodiversity progressively arose from\nchanges in development, was already anticipated by Johann F. Meckel\n(1812) and Richard Owen (1837), who parallelized\n‘transmutations’ of embryonic forms and transmutations of\nspecies. Also Darwin (1837) describes the genesis of individuals as a\n‘shortened repetition’ of morphological changes during\nphylogeny. From the end of the 19th century this view of\ndevelopment as a recapitulation of evolution became problematic (see\nRasmussen 1991). First, during this time the view of a linear\nevolution from invertebrates over vertebrates to humans was\nincreasingly questioned. Second, based on comparative studies of cell\nlineages across different taxa in the 1890s, scholars criticized that\nnot only adult organisms but their developmental pathways evolve, too.\nFor example, in 1898, embryologist Edmund B. Wilson (1898) was using\nhomologous patterns of embryonic cell division to unite taxa, while\nembryologist Frank R. Lillie (1898) studied differences in these\npatterns to show the origins of evolutionary adaptations. These\nstudies were (at least to some part) in conflict with Haeckel’s\nrecapitulationism, as they saw ontogeny not as sufficiently explained\nby historical causes, but rather in need of independent mechanistic\nlaws operating on physical properties of the ontogenetic material (see\nGuralnick 2002). In addition, this cell lineage research suggested\nthat Haeckel’s law on the relationship between development and\nevolution should be inverted, as cell lineages evolve over\nevolutionary time. In more general terms, this means that development\ndoes not merely mimic evolution. Rather, it is a source of variation\nand thus a cause of evolution and adaptation: “ontogeny does not\nrecapitulate phylogeny, it creates it” (Garstang 1922: 81). In\nshort, evolution proceeds through modifications of development. \nAnother characteristic of 19th century (and early\n20th century) biology was the lack of a clear conceptual\nparting between developmental and reproductive processes. Especially\nthe idea of the inheritance of acquired characteristics was part of\nthe mainstream of evolutionary thought (Bowler 1983, 2017; Gissis\n& Jablonka 2011). According to Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1809),\nchanges in the structure or function of traits that occurred during an\norganism’s life, depending on their use or disuse, could be\ninherited. Darwin adopted this idea in his inheritance theory of\npangenesis (see Holterhoff 2014). He suggested that all body parts, at\neach developmental stage, contain small particles, so-called\n‘gemmules,’ that were sensitive to environmental changes.\nThese particles accumulate in the reproductive organs and are\ntransmitted to the next generation. Thus, gemmules modified during\ndevelopment lead to modifications in the next generation. Darwin\nstated that due to this close connection of development and\nreproduction, “inheritance must be looked at as merely a form of\ngrowth” (Darwin 1868: II, 404). However, this connection between\ndevelopment and inheritance was increasingly criticized in the first\nhalf of the 20th century. Following August Weismann (1892),\nthe inheritance of environmentally induced variation in somatic cells\n(the body) of organisms was increasingly called into question. In\nsexually reproducing organisms, only the germ plasm used for the sperm\nand eggs were recognized as carrying information that are passed on to\nthe next generation. According to this view, the germ line was immune\nfrom variation occurring in the somatic cells of the body, and thus\nthe inheritance of acquired characteristics or other theories of\nplasmatic inheritance were rejected (but see Harwood 1993, Gilbert\n& Epel 2015).  \nThis parting between development, on the one side, and inheritance and\nevolution, on the other, through Weismann’s theory of\ninheritance, had long lasting effects on how biologists reasoned about\nevolution in the following years. Despite continuing efforts of\nneo-Lamarckians well into the 1930s (Bowler 1983), development\nincreasingly vanished from the landscape of evolutionary theory. By\nuniting Mendel’s laws and new findings in genetics within the\nstatistical framework of population genetics, the modern synthesis\ncame to understand evolution as a change in the frequencies of\ndifferent alleles in a population (Fisher 1930; Dobzhansky 1951).\nVariation relevant to evolution was produced only in the genes of the\ngerm line. These random changes, mutations, were screened off from the\ndevelopmental history of the individual. In the 1940s and 50s this\nview was increasingly manifested, not least through the so-called\n‘central dogma’ of molecular biology (Crick 1958). It\nstates (similar to Weismann’s theory) that information flows\nalways from the DNA to proteins, never vice versa. Thus, phenotypic\nchanges during development could not affect the genes. The trend to\nlink genes with populations in evolutionary explanations, rather than\ndevelopment with evolution reached its climax with the gene’s\neye view of evolution (Williams 1966; Dawkins 1976). By focusing on\nthe question how certain traits like altruistic behaviors could be\nbeneficial, it not only identified genes (rather than organisms) as\nthe sole units of selection. In addition, it described development as\nnothing but the readout of a genetic program (Maienschein 2003;\nPigliucci 2010). Genes control the development of traits and\norganisms’ behaviors, and they replicate to secure their own\nfurther propagation in groups and populations. \nDuring the twentieth century these partings of development and\nevolution let to statements such as: “Problems concerned with\nthe orderly development of the individual are unrelated to those of\nthe evolution of organisms through time” (Wallace 1986: 149).\nHowever, such statements were also targeted by a number of critics.\nFor example, the exclusion of developmental biology from the modern\nsynthesis (Harrison 1937; De Beer 1954; Waddington 1957; Hamburger\n1980), the explanatory autocracy of the adaptationist program in\nevolutionary biology (Gould & Lewontin 1979), and the omission of\na satisfying theory of evolutionary novelty, in which development\nwould play a role (Goldschmidt 1940), have been criticized. Not least\ndue to this rejection of developmental perspectives, evolutionary\ntheory has been blamed to constrain the direction of research in\nevolutionary biology (Provine 1989). In fact, throughout the twentieth\ncentury a number of theories have been put forward, which argue that\ndue to the partial independence of genetic and phenotypic variation,\nevolutionary research should put more emphasis on how the changes in\ndevelopmental and behavioral patterns might drive or bias evolutionary\nchange. This includes cases of ‘canalized’ developmental\npathway which are maintained, even though the genotype or the\nenvironment might have changed to some degree (Waddington 1957; see\nalso Nijhout 2002; Gilbert & Epel 2015; Sultan 2015). In addition,\nstudies of phenotypic plasticity showed that a trait of an organism\ncan react to an environmental input in various ways, and that the\ngenome codes for a wide range of potential phenotypes (Waddington\n1942; Nijhout 1990; Pigliucci 2001). The evolutionary relevance of\nthese findings was emphasized by studies that investigated how the\nrange of variation changes from a plastic trait to a fixed or\ncanalized one over the course of generations (Suzuki and Nijhout 2008;\nWest-Eberhard 2003; B. Baker et al. 2019). What is more, according to\nthe so-called ‘Baldwin effect,’ learned behavioral\npatterns (e.g., the acclimatization to a new stressor) that were\ninitially rather plastic, can affect the reproductive success of\nindividuals and thus, across generations and through natural\nselection, be gradually incorporated into the genetic and epigenetic\nmakeup of a species (Baldwin 1896; Simpson 1953; Piaget 1976 [1978];\nNewman 2002). While some of these developmental perspectives on\nevolution were consistent with the population genetic framework of\nevolutionary biology and were, in fact, gradually incorporated into\nevolutionary thought, others posed more serious challenges for\ntheoretical integration. \nBy building on the latter, more problematic set of approaches\n(especially in recent years), evolutionary theory has been facing\ncalls from developmentally oriented biologists and philosophers of\nbiology to widen the standard explanatory and methodological\napproaches on evolution (Bonner 1958; Alberch 1982; Bonner 1982; Raff\n& Kaufman 1983; Gilbert, Opitz, & Raff 1996; Schlichting &\nPigliucci 1998; West-Eberhard 2003; G. Müller 2007; Pigliucci\n& Müller 2010; Bateson & Gluckman 2011; Jablonka &\nLamb 2014; Laland et al. 2014, 2015; Gilbert & Epel 2015; G. Müller 2017; for discussion, see Huneman\n& Walsh 2017; Fábregas-Tejeda & Vergara-Silva 2018; Baedke et al. 2020b). They argue that evolutionary change should not only or\nprimarily be investigated and explained as a change in genotype\nfrequencies in populations but (also) on the level of the developing\nand acting individual. The underlying idea is that phenotypic\nvariation and the flexibility of organisms’ responses to\nenvironmental cues may introduce non-random variation and thus may\nbias and/or direct morphological evolution to some degree. This\nincludes not only environmentally induced changes in regulatory\nprocesses but also the physical constraints of the developing embryo.\nBy focusing on these phenomena, Kevin Laland and colleagues (2014:\n161) state: “An alternative vision of evolution is beginning to\ncrystallize, in which the processes by which organisms grow and\ndevelop are recognized as causes of evolution”. Others have\nargued that genes are probably more often followers in evolution than\nleaders (West-Eberhard 2003, 2005). In other words, the\nenvironmentally responsive, developing and acting organism takes the\nlead. It introduces in a non-random way new phenotypes into\npopulations that are subsequently stabilized by genes. \nThis ‘development first view’ (or sometimes called\n‘plasticity first view’) of evolution is currently adopted\nespecially by researchers in three fields of research: evolutionary\ndevelopmental biology (evo-devo), epigenetics, and niche construction\ntheory. Evo-devo studies how developmental pathways evolve and, more\nimportant for the above view, how developmental constraints and biases\ncan affect evolutionary trajectories (Raff 1996, 2000; Gerhart &\nKirschner 1997; Love 2003; Amundson 2005; Laubichler & Maienschein\n2007; Sansom & Brandon 2007; G. Müller 2007; Minelli 2009;\nLaubichler 2010; Pigliucci & Müller 2010; Gilbert & Epel\n2015; Moczek et al. 2015; Levis & Pfennig 2020). This includes\nasking how changes in gene regulatory networks cause modifications of\ndevelopmental processes (associated with major shifts in morphological\n‘body plans’) and thus produce evolutionary novelties, or\nwhat capacities organisms have to generate heritable, adaptive\nphenotypic variation and thus to evolve in evolution (i.e. their\nevolvability; see Hendrikse et al. 2007). This focus on how phenotypic\nvariation is produced, rather than how it is selected, is supported by\nstudies in epigenetics on inter- and transgenerational epigenetic\ninheritance (see the entry\n inheritance systems),\n like through the transmission of regulatory factors of gene activity\n(Jablonka & Lamb 1989, 2014, Janlonka & Raz 2009, Perez &\nLehner 2019). Other forms of extra-genetic inheritance include the\ntransmission of microbiota (Gilbert et al. 2012, 2014, Browne et al.\n2017) and behaviorally mediated parental effects (Kappeler &\nMeaney 2010; Rilling & Young 2014). This set of processes contains\nenvironmentally sensitive non-genetic sources of variation for\norganisms that can be transmitted across generations, in many cases\ndecoupled from the transfer of genetic information. Finally, niche\nconstruction theory highlights the self-perpetuating and reciprocal\neffects of organisms, as agents, that construct their own niche\n(and/or that of other species) during development (Lewontin 1982;\nSterelny 2001; Day et al. 2003; Odling-Smee et al. 2003; Laland et al.\n2008, 2009, 2011; Odling-Smee 2010; Chiu & Gilbert 2015, 2020; Aaby & Ramsey forthcoming).\nThese recent studies on developmental evolution will be discussed in\ndetail in section 3. \nThe various developments in the above fields have led to an increasing\nphilosophical interest in conceptual and explanatory issues arising\nfrom the new junction of development and evolution. These include\nclarifying what causal relationships and boundaries exist between the\ntwo realms, which different roles developmental processes play in\nrecent evolutionary research, and how these new roles affect\nontological frameworks of the organism. In addition, these\ndevelopments have been accompanied by debates about the structure of\nexplanations in developmental evolution. Finally, they have informed\ndiscussions on anthropological understandings and ethical questions\nconcerning humans. We will now discuss the debates on these issues in\ndetail.  \nOne of the most central topics of early philosophy of biology in the\n1960s and 1970s was the attempt to develop a suitable conceptual\nframework that would support the parting between development and\nevolution in line with the central assumption of the Modern Synthesis\nthat evolution is a change in the genetic composition of populations\nonly (Dobzhansky 1951: 16; see also Charlesworth et al. 2017). This\nmeans, as a consequence, that development does not (or not in\nsignificant ways) causally effect evolution. Over the decades this\nassumption has been supported by the historically influential\nconceptual distinction between proximate causes and ultimate causes\n(Mayr 1961). \nThe dual framework ‘proximate vs. ultimate’ provides a\nqualitative distinction of biological causality (for related\ndistinctions, see J. Baker 1938; Tinbergen 1951, 1963). It holds that\nbiologists who study proximate causes ask how questions about\nindividual developmental processes. Thus, functional biologists\ninterested in such proximate causes study how systems work. Instead,\nevolutionary biologists that study ultimate causes ask why questions,\nlike why phylogenesis has produced particular evolutionary functions.\nAccording to this distinction, at least on the surface, proximate\ncauses resemble Aristotelian efficient causes while ultimate causes\nresemble Aristotelian final causes. To illustrate this distinction,\nMayr (1961) draws on an example of avian migration. Migration can be\nstudied by asking how bird migrate (i.e., how they develop skills like\nnavigation) or why they migrate (i.e., due to what selective\nadvantage). These two investigations are understood to be both\nimportant and complementary. However, they should be treated as\ndistinct from one another. \nThe proximate-ultimate distinction can be given an epistemic or\nontological reading. First, authors have interpreted it as\ndistinguishing different kinds of explanations (Amundson 2005; Calcott\n2013; Scholl & Pigliucci 2015). This epistemic reading includes\nthat how questions cannot be addressed by explanations citing ultimate\ncauses (i.e., telling a story of adaptation) and that why questions\ncannot be addressed by explanations citing proximate causes (i.e.,\ntelling a story of trait development). Second, authors have\ninterpreted this distinction as one between different ontological\nclasses of causes working in ontogenetic and phylogenetic processes\n(Laland et al. 2013a). This ontological reading is backed up\ntheoretically by Weismann’s concept of the separation of germ\nline and soma, which provides a demarcation line between two distinct\nclasses of causes. To this day, biologists and philosophers have not\nreached a consensus on how exactly the division\n‘proximate-ultimate’ or ‘how-why’ should be\nunderstood, epistemically or ontologically (Francis 1990; Dewsbury\n1992, 1999; Sterelny 1992; Beatty 1994; Ariew 2003). Despite this lack\nof agreement this framework has been applied in various fields, from\nevolutionary biology (E. O. Wilson 1975 [2000: 23]), evolutionary\npsychology (Daly & Wilson 1978; Crawford 1998) and behavioral\necology (Morse 1980: 92–95) to human sciences, like in human\ncooperation (Marchionni & Vromen 2009) and developmental\npsychology (Lickliter & Berry 1990). Especially in evolutionary\nbiology it has contributed to mainstream causal reasoning for a long\ntime, even among evolutionary biologists interested in developmental\nprocesses (see, e.g., Maynard Smith 1982: 6). \nThere has been constant criticism of the proximate-ultimate\ndistinction (since even before Mayr 1961), and against its underlying\nidea to downgrade the explanatory or causal relevance of development\nto evolution. More recently, the discussion of this issue gained pace\nthrough new findings in fields such as epigenetics, evo-devo and niche\nconstruction theory (Thierry 2005; Laland et al. 2011, 2013a, 2013b;\nHaig 2011, 2013; Scott-Phillips et al. 2011; Dickins & Rahman\n2012; Guerrero-Bosagna 2012; Calcott 2013; Dickins & Barton 2013;\nGardner 2013; Mesoudi et al. 2013; Martínez & Esposito\n2014; Scholl & Pigliucci 2015; Baedke 2018; Uller & Laland\n2019). In this context, some scholars argue that the\nproximate-ultimate distinction stands “at the center of some of\ncontemporary biology’s fiercest debates” (Laland et al.\n2011: 1512) about the role of developmental plasticity, niche\nconstruction and inclusive inheritance for evolutionary trajectories.\nParticipants in this debate have argued that we should, due to\ndifferent epistemic or heuristic reasons, keep Mayr’s\nproximate-ultimate distinction (Scott-Phillips et al. 2011; Dickins\n& Barton 2013) or a revised or reinterpreted form of it (Scholl\n& Pigliucci 2015; Otsuka 2015), expand it by a third intermediate\nform of explanations (Haig 2013), or replace it with a concept of\n‘reciprocal causation’ (Laland et al. 2011, 2013a, 2013b,\n2015; Mesoudi et al. 2013). In line with earlier philosophical work\n(Oyama 1985; Keller 2010; Griffiths & Stotz 2013), the latter idea\nof reciprocal causation should allow describing the feedback processes\nbetween causal factors in evolving systems. This includes\norganisms’ capacity of phenotypic plasticity or, more\nspecifically, their activities to alter selection pressures.\nParadigmatic feedback cases are niche construction behaviors of\norganisms that modify their environments and thus shape natural\nselection pressures working on them. In other words, reciprocal\ncausation holds that organisms are not only effects of adaptive\nprocesses, but also causal starting points of evolutionary\ntrajectories. In this sense this framework argues against the causal\nand/or explanatory asymmetry claim of the proximate-ultimate\ndistinction. It highlights the important role of development for\nevolution. \nAgainst this new approach, scholars have argued that reciprocal\ncausation does, in fact, not pose any conceptual challenges for\nevolutionary biology, as it has been included since quite some time\nago in the field (Svennson 2018). A true challenge, however, is to\ndevelop this idea into a methodologically sound framework that allows\nstudying and modeling complex non-linear organism-environment\nrelations. Other have cast doubt on the central causal role the unit\nof the organism is supposed to play in this reciprocity framework\n(Baedke 2019a), or questioned whether this conceptualization can, in\nfact, capture all causal dependency relations of interest for\nevolutionary biology (Martínez & Esposito 2014; Scholl\n& Pigliucci 2015). Moreover, some argued that also this framework\nrelies on the dichotomy between development and evolution (Dickins\n& Barton 2013; Martínez & Esposito 2014) and that it is not conducive to\nsuccessful biological science, as it does not lead to falsifiable\nquestions (Dickins & Rahman 2012) and bleeds proximate and\nultimate explanations into each other so that their distinction\nbecomes meaningless (Gardner 2013; one should mention, however, that\nthis might be the very aim of this approach). More generally, it has\nbeen requested that advocates of this approach should provide more\nconceptual clarifications on what reciprocal causation actually is\nsupposed to mean (Buskell 2019). \nBesides distinguishing development and evolution in a qualitative\nmanner as proximate and ultimate causal processes, a less common\nattempt is to quantitatively distinguish (or relate) the two. Here,\nespecially distinctions based on the rates or time scales on which\ndifferent developmental and biological processes occur have been made\n(see the entry\n levels of organization in biology).\n For example, Conrad H. Waddington (1957) developed a hierarchical\nmodel of time scales that includes biochemical processes on lower\nmolecular levels of organization with a faster rate, medium paced\nprocesses of development on a medium level, and evolutionary processes\non higher levels with a slower rate. According to such a view,\nevolutionary processes are simply processes occurring with a different\nrate and thus at a different level than developmental ones. Thus, they\ndiffer gradually rather than in kind. Rate-based distinctions have\nbeen described to be consistent with the ultimate-proximate framework\n(when interpreting it as one that distinguishes different timescales\nof phenotypic change; see Francis 1990; Haig 2013) or as different\nfrom proximate-ultimate distinctions (Baedke & Mc Manus 2018). In\naddition, time-scale (or size-scale) conceptualizations have been\napplied for developing methodologies and multi-scale modeling that\nintegrate, among others, developmental and evolutionary processes (S.\nLevin 1992; Green & Batterman 2017; Duckworth 2019). \nThe idea that evolution constitutes changing developmental\nrelationships is central for the field of evolutionary developmental\nbiology (evo-devo). The field describes itself as the science that\nstudies how alterations in development create the variations that\nnature can select (Raff & Kaufman 1983; Gilbert, Opitz, & Raff\n1996). In other words, natural selection did not create variation;\ndevelopment creates variation. Development is the artist; natural\nselection is the curator (Gilbert 2006, 2019). Both have creative\nagency; but they are working at different levels. Although this view\nhad been expressed by scientists such as Thomas Huxley, Julian Huxley,\nConrad H. Waddington, and Richard B. Goldschmidt, it gained credence\nthrough more recent discoveries that explained how normal development\ncould occur. Chief among these discoveries was the explication of\ndevelopmental pathways that connected embryonic induction with gene\nexpression. Here, paracrine factors (proteins that influence the\nbehaviors or gene expression patterns of neighboring cells) secreted\nby one set of cells were received by receptors on the membranes of\nother cells. These receptors then activated proteins within the\ncytoplasm, which eventually activated or repressed proteins that entered\nthe nucleus to regulate transcription of particular genes. \nThe second major discovery that promoted evo-devo was the discovery of\nmodular enhancers. The above-mentioned transcription factors would\nbind to specific regions of DNA, called enhancers. Most genes have\nmultiple enhancers. Thus, a gene might have a ‘limb’\nenhancer that activates the expression of the gene in the limb, and an\n‘eye’ enhancer that enables the expression of the gene in\nthe eye. Moreover, each enhancer usually binds several transcription\nfactors and could be activated in Boolean <and> or <or>\nfashion. Evolution could occur by creating or deleting enhancers,\nthereby enabling genes to be expressed differently in different\nspecies. King and Wilson (1975) and Jacob (1977) had speculated that\nevolution occurred by changes in gene regulation. This provided a\nmodel for such regulation, and some of the best examples are seen in\nthe divergence of humans from other apes (Geschwind & Konopka\n2012; Pollard et al. 2006). As Haraway (2008) noted, “relationships are the smallest\npossible pattern for analysis”, and the relation between\nenhancer and transcription factor may indicate the ‘natural\nkinds’ of the biological world (Gilbert & Bard 2014).\nMoreover, the entities defined by enhancer/transcription factor\ninteractions during development are often unexpected and do not mirror\nintuitive boundaries between entities in adults. Activation of genes\nto form the distal rib, for instance, is controlled by a different\nenhancer than that which activates genes in the proximal rib (Guenther\net al. 2008). \nThese differences in gene expression could be categorized into four\ncategories (Arthur 2004). One of these categories involves the\nplace of gene expression, where different populations of\ncells express a particular gene in different species. For instance,\nthe gremlin gene in the duck hindlimb webbing protects these\ncells from cell death, enabling webbed feet (Laufer et al, 1997;\nMerino et al. 1999). A second category involves changes in the\ntiming of gene expression, as in the continued expression of\nthe fgf8 gene at the tip of the dolphin forelimbs, thus\nenabling the extension of its flippers (Richardson &\nOelschläger 2002). A third category of change involves\nalterations in the magnitude of gene expression, as in the\ndifferences in Bmp4 gene expression that determine the width\nof finch beaks (Abzhanov et al. 2004). A fourth category focuses on\nthe alterations of the actual protein sequence of regulatory\nproteins, as in the changes of the Antennapedia gene in\ninsects, which restrict insects from forming more than six limbs\n(Galant and Carroll 2002). \nThe third discovery was the elucidation of gene regulatory networks\n(GRNs). A GRN is based on paracrine factors, signal transduction\ncascades, and transcription factors. While ignoring\npost-transcriptional gene regulation, this concept attempts to explain\nhow initial conditions (RNAs and proteins within the oocyte, position\nof the embryo within the uterus, etc.) could create the conditions\nwhereby cell types differ, even though their genomes are identical.\nSpearheaded by Eric Davidson (2001, 2006), this approach uses systems\ntheory concepts such as modularity and dissociability to explain how\nthe genes interact in a hierarchical manner to produce different\ncell types (Levine & Davidson 2005) and how the cell types in\nrelated species could differ by the recruitment (co-option) of a\nparticular GRN by altering transcription factor binding. More\ngenerally, the discovery of GRNs has enabled the integration of\ndevelopmental biology with paleontology (Jablonski 2017; Hinman et al.\n2003; Hinman & Cheatle Jarvela 2014) and may also be extended into\nareas of symbiosis and niche construction (Laubichler & Renn\n2015). \nA fourth discovery of evolutionary developmental biology was the\nimportance of developmental plasticity for evolution (Nijhout 1990;\nGilbert 2001; Pigliucci 2001). By the end of the 20th century, the\nroles of temperature, sunlight, diet, crowding, maternal behaviors,\nand predation were seen to have major roles in effecting phenotypes in\nplants and animals. Thus, the environment not only selected\nvariations, it helped produce them. Since evo-devo postulated that\nchanges in development cause evolution, and since developmental\nplasticity played a role in development, then it became necessary to\nlook at changes in plasticity as being part of evolution. In the early\nyears of the 21st century, developmental plasticity was seen to play\nroles in evolutionary change (West-Eberhard 2003; Abouheif et al.\n2014; Suzuki & Nijhout 2006; Rajakumar et al. 2018; Levis &\nPfennig 2020), and the notion of ‘plasticity-first\nevolution’ (or ‘development-first evolution’)\nintegrated data from numerous sources into a program where the\nphysiological ability to alter one’s phenotype due to\nenvironmental agents could become canalized and genetically fixed by\nselection. The mechanisms by which such plasticity-first evolution was\neffected (unmasking and selection of cryptic genetic variants,\nstress-related inability of molecular chaperones to allow proper\nfolding of mutant proteins, etc.) became a new research program. \nA fifth discovery was the realization that one of the major\nenvironmental agents effecting development were symbiotic microbes\n(McFall-Ngai 2002; Gilbert et al. 2012, 2015). The notion of the\nholobiont (i.e. an integrated composite organism composed of microbial\nand host eukaryotic species) organized much of the data to look at the\nroles of microbes in causing both the normal development of the\norganism and variations of normal development (in disease and\nevolution) (Rosenberg & Zilber-Rosenberg 2016; see entry\n biological individuals).\n For instance, in the mouse, the normal development of the immune\nsystem and the gut capillary network depends upon specific bacteria\nobtained during birth. These bacteria induce the expression of\nparticular genes in the eukaryotic cells, and the proteins made by\nthese genes influence cell fate (Hooper et al. 2001; McFall-Ngai et\nal. 2013). In other words, the bacteria can act as an embryonic cell\nwould, regulating gene expression in neighboring cells. Here, the\neukaryotic organism needs and expects these bacteria to be present for\nnormal development. \nAs in the other cases of developmental plasticity, the next step was\nto see if changes in developmental symbionts could produce changes in\nevolution (see O'Malley 2015). It was shown that changes in symbionts could provide\nselectable variants for evolution (Zhang et al. 2019), and it could\nprovide the basis for reproductive isolation through cytoplasmic\nincompatibility or mating preference (Brucker & Bordenstein 2013;\nSharon et al. 2010). One of the most interesting possibilities,\nthough, comes from the view that most, if not all, eukaryotic\norganisms are holobionts, and that symbionts open new evolutionary\ntrajectories. Symbiotic microbes, for instance, have long been known\nto be responsible for the plant-digesting enzymes in the stomachs of\nruminants. Without cellulose-digesting bacteria, cows cannot digest\ngrass or grain. Moreover, the microbes help create the rumen after\nthey colonize the digestive system at birth. Thus, these microbes also\ninduce the formation of the organ that houses them, and allows them to\nfunction (Gilbert 2020; Chiu & Gilbert 2020). Developmental\nsymbiosis (sympoiesis) thus has opened evolutionary trajectories for\ncertain mammals. This is an example of both developmental symbiosis\nand niche construction. Niche construction depends on developmental\nplasticity (Laland et al. 2008). \nThese five new (or renewed) aspects of developmental biology have\nseveral philosophical implications. Among others, they concern\nontological questions of what developing organisms are and how they\nshould be explained from an integrated perspective of developmental\nevolution. \nMany ontological debates on the relation between development and\nevolution focus on the organism as the central unit, which both\ndevelops and evolves, in contrast to, for example, genes or\npopulations. Several theories have tried to clarify the nature of this\norganismic unit: According to one influential view, the organism is a\nseries of integrated processes during a life cycle (Bonner 1965;\nNicholson & Dupré 2018; Fusco 2019a; DiFrisco 2019), with\ncomplex and reciprocal relationships between the whole organism and\nits parts (Gilbert & Sarkar 2000; Esposito 2016; Peterson 2017).\nCentral elements of this view are based on an organicist framework\ndeveloped by Kant, which states that in organisms “the parts,\nwith respect to both form and being, are only possible through their\nrelationship to the whole” and “that the parts bind\nthemselves mutually into the unity of a whole in such a way that they\nare mutually cause and effect of one another” (Kant 1790/1793\n[1902: 373]; see also Lenoir 1982). Haraway (2008) highlights the\nlatter idea of reciprocal interaction between organisms’ parts\nby saying: “Reciprocal induction is the name of the game”\n(2008: 228) and it is “reciprocating complexity all the way\ndown” (2008: 42). These ideas of life cycle integration and\nubiquitous reciprocity suggest a more processual and organism-centered\nontological perspective on the organism. This view is becoming\nimportant in studies of evolution. For example, in order to understand\nhow nervous systems evolve one need to consider that the nervous\nsystem of the developing organism has different functions than the\nadult nervous system and may be used to coordinate body construction\nas it develops (M. Levin 2019; Fields et al. 2020). That developing\nsystems show exaptation and competition and that evolving systems show\ncooperation has allowed Fields and Levin (forthcoming) to suggest that\ndevelopmental and evolutionary processes can be integrated on a\nscale-free level through the language of information processing and\ncommunication. \nA second ontological consideration states that developing and evolving\norganisms are integrated collective individuals, so-called holobionts\nor ‘meta-organisms’ (Zilber-Rosenberg & Rosenberg\n2008; Bosch & McFall-Ngai 2011; Gilbert, Sapp, & Tauber 2012;\nsee also O'Malley 2017; Baedke et al. 2020a). Therefore, our\ndiscussions about evolution must take into consideration that each\norganism is a consortium having numerous genomes, not just one, as\ntraditionally assumed. Mathematical modeling of the evolution of\nholobionts that take this diversity into consideration is just\nbeginning (Roughgarden et al. 2018; Osmanovic et al. 2018; Roughgarden\n2020). This new ontological framework states that symbiosis is the\nnorm; it is not peripheral. These symbionts can act at different\nstages of the life cycle and are seen to scaffold development\n(Griesemer 2014; Chiu & Gilbert 2015; Minelli 2016). In\n‘scaffolding,’ each developmental stage is made possible\nby entities and processes that catalyze these activities, which allows\nnovel and evolutionary relevant processes to occur at lower\ndifficulties and costs. \nA third ontological point concerns the exact nature of the link\nbetween development and evolution. Two approaches have been put\nforward: One draws on the idea that the biological entity that is\ncausally efficacious in both realms can only be found on the level of\nintegrated collectives of symbiotic interactions. Following in the\ntradition of Leibnitz’ notion of compossibility as well as\nMargulis’ (1999) claim that we live on a ‘symbiotic\nplanet,’ this view argues that symbiotic collectives are not\nonly essential units of development but also of evolution. This leads\nto a view of evolution that is not centered on interspecies conflict\nand competition between individuals (Huxley 1888; Williams 1966;\nDawkins 1976). Instead the entities that evolve are cooperative\nco-developing collectives (Rosenberg & Zilber-Rosenberg 2016;\nRoughgarden et al. 2018; for discussion, see Peacock 2011;\nSuárez 2018). \nA different ontological framework links\ndevelopment and evolution through the entity of the acting organism\n(Nicholson 2014, 2018; Walsh 2015; for discussion, see Pradeu 2016;\nBaedke 2019a, 2019b). These approaches usually are less related to\nsymbiosis research than to studies on niche construction or maternal\neffects. Here the organism (e.g., a beaver that builds a dam or an\nearthworm that processes the soil) is constructed as a self-determined\nagent that through its behavior modulates the selection pressures\nacting on it (Odling-Smee et al. 2003; Uller & Helanterä\n2019). Thus, so the argument goes, it can bias and direct population\ndynamics. The holobiont perspective and the niche construction\nperspective join together when one appreciates that the microbes and\nthe host form each other’s environment. Here, the host and the\nmicrobes scaffold each other’s development and evolution (Chiu\n& Gilbert 2015, 2020).  \nWhether or not we consider collectives or organismic individual agents\nas the core entities partaking both in development and evolution,\nattempts to integrate the two realms have to show in each case that,\nin fact, it is the same unit that develops and evolves. In\nother words, if we want to unify development and evolution through the\nunit of the biological individual (being the one entity that partakes\nin both) this unit needs to meet criteria of both physiological (e.g.,\nmetabolic) and evolutionary individuality (see the entry on\n  biological individuals).\nEvolutionary individuals have been traditionally conceptualized as\nreproductive units with differential fitness and shared lineages\n(so-called ‘Darwinian individuals’; see Godfrey-Smith\n2009) or as units of selection (‘interactors’; see Hull\n1980). Unfortunately, both of these units do not always coincide\n(Godfrey-Smith 2013; Pradeu 2016). For example, some organisms (holobionts) form developing\nbut no reproductive units, as they include a multitude of lineages\n(e.g., microbial ones). Other possible units of selection (like genes\nor populations) are not identical with physiological individuals.\nThus, a physiological individual may not necessarily be an\nevolutionary unit or vice versa. \nThis brings us to a fourth ontological point: developmental\nplasticity, which is considered to bias or even guide evolutionary\ntrajectories (West-Eberhard 2003; Radersma et al. forthcoming). The\nconcept of plasticity states that development can be regulated in\nimportant ways by the environment. This rules out genetic determinism\n(but not necessarily environmental determinism; see Waggoner and Uller\n2015). In the original conception of phenotype production (i.e.,\ndevelopment), Wilhelm Johannsen (1909) had pointed out that the phenotype\nis the product of both the genotype and environmental circumstance, and\nWoltereck (1909; see also Sarkar 1999) argued that what was inherited\nis the “Reaktionsnorm”, a potential to generate\nphenotypic variations in response to environmental agents. In line with this view, many\nembryology texts in the late 1800s (e.g., Hertwig 1894) had promulgated the\nperspective that development demanded both the interactions between\nembryonic cells and the further interactions of those cells with the\nenvironment (see Nyhart 1995). \nDespite this history, developmental plasticity was marginalized as\ngenetic explanations came to the fore in the mid-20th century (Sarkar\n1998; Keller 2002). Against this background, embryologists such as\nLewis Wolpert (1994) could ask whether an organism’s phenotype\ncould be computed if we had the total description of the egg. Due to\nthe above findings on organism-environment interaction (see section\n3), a different view emerged that more seriously considers the\nenvironmental-responsiveness and plasticity of the developing\nphenotype. This view includes a shift from externalist to internalist\nor constructionist understandings of the organism-environment\nrelationship (Godfrey-Smith 1996). While the externalist view –\nthe orthodox view in evolutionary theory – conceptualizes\nproperties of organisms as a result of their environments (i.e.\nnatural selection targeting genetic programs), the internalist view\nsees “one set of organic properties in terms of other internal\nor intrinsic properties of the organic system” (Godfrey-Smith\n1996: 30). According to these two accounts, organisms occupy an\nenvironment that covaries with them or that is largely independent of\ntheir variation. The above research in developmental evolution\nsuggests a switch from an externalist to a constructionist\nperspective, in which the organism actively molds its internal states\nand responds to and alters its external environment (see Laland et al.\n2014, 2015). In addition, in this framework also the causal role of\nthe environment becomes more complex. It now includes the idea that\nthe environment has active agency that can determine the phenotype.\nRather than conceptualizing the environment as nothing but a passive\nfilter for evolution, in this view the environment plays a role in\nactuating the phenotype in addition to selecting it (Moczek 2015;\nGilbert & Epel 2015). \nBesides these discussions about the ontology of developing and\nevolving organisms, other central philosophical debates on the\ninterface between development and evolution have targeted the topic of\nscientific explanation. This refers to the questions of what studies\nof developmental evolution (should) explain and how they explain.  \nPhilosophers of science have long argued for the explanatory autonomy\nof biological explanations. Especially, they have criticized\nunderstanding biological explanation as similar to law-based accounts\nof explanations in physics (see Lange 2007). In contrast, scholars\nhave argued that explanation in the biosciences often includes\ndescribing a mechanism that brings about a certain biological\nphenomenon (Bechtel & Richardson 1993; Craver 2007; Bechtel &\nAbrahamsen 2010; see also entry\n mechanisms in science).\n Especially evo-devo has been described as a paradigmatic mechanistic\nscience, which – against the ultimate-proximate distinction\n– seeks to identify developmental mechanisms that can explain\nevolutionary change in phenotypes (Gilbert 2003; Hall 2012). This\nmechanistic approach is often flanked by mathematical models of\nvarious developmental patterns, from changes in gene regulatory\nnetworks to growth patterns of organisms, and by historical narratives\non how organisms and species evolve (Jaeger & Sharpe 2014; Winther\n2015). However, besides the accepted centrality of mechanistic\nexplanation for developmental evolution, a much-debated topic concerns\nwhat exactly a developmental mechanism is and how it functions in\nevolutionary explanation compared to standard explanations citing\nnatural selection.  \nPhilosophers of biology (in the so-called new mechanistic philosophy)\nhave conceptualized mechanistic explanations in biology as the\nconstruction of models of mechanisms that connect parts of systems,\nlocated on one level of organization, with behaviors of the whole\nsystem, usually located on a higher level of organization (Machamer et\nal. 2000; Craver 2007; Illari & Williamson 2012). In this\nframework, mechanistic models relate different compositional levels of\norganization, like genes and phenotypes or cells and tissues. These\ninter-level relations exist between causal capacities of parts of a\nsystem and their organization and the capacities of a system as a\nwhole. Such relations are established following a procedure of\ndecomposition and localization (Bechtel & Richardson 1993; Craver\n2007; Menzies 2012). This conceptual framework to describe biological\nmechanisms and mechanistic explanation has been developed based on\ncase studies in molecular and cell biology. However, scholars have\ncast doubt on whether it is also useful to describe mechanistic\nexplanations in studies of development and developmental\nevolution. \nWith respect to development, it has been argued, first, that\norganization plays a different role in mechanistic developmental\nexplanations (Mc Manus 2012). In contrast to the above framework,\nwhich usually presupposes that levels of organization are simply\nthere, and thus it does not have to clarify how levels of organization\nactually originate, the origin of levels and other forms of\norganization (e.g., spatial axes) are specifically addressed in\nmechanistic developmental explanations. Second, philosophers have\nargued that the relations between levels traced by developmental\nmechanisms are not exhausted by the synchronic, constitutive relations\nbetween parts and wholes, as some new mechanists suggest (Craver &\nBechtel 2007). In contrast, developmental explanations trace changing\ndiachronic relationships between causal capacities of a system at\ndifferent levels of organization at different time intervals (Ylikoski\n2013; Baedke & Mc Manus 2018; Baedke 2020; see also Love &\nHüttemann 2011). Third, it has been argued that explanations in\nevo-devo using developmental mechanisms face a challenge due to the\nheterogeneity of these mechanisms (Love 2018). When trying to\nintegrate two types of explanations of developmental mechanisms\n– explanations of highly conserved molecular genetic mechanisms,\nlike gene regulatory networks, and explanations of cellular-physical\nmechanisms, like cell migration – sometimes a tradeoff emerges.\nRather than allowing a more complete explanation, integrating the two\nmechanisms may lead to a less general explanation, since\nnon-phylogenetically conserved cellular-physical mechanisms yield less\ngenerality in explanations. This tradeoff can introduce an explanatory\nbias to projects that seek to integrate development and evolution. It\ncould lead researchers to favors the generality of explanations, which\ncite highly conserved molecular genetic mechanisms and no\ncellular-physical mechanisms, over integrated explanations citing both\nkinds of mechanisms. \nWith respect to the concept of mechanism in developmental evolution,\nBrigandt (2015) highlights that some mechanistic explanations in\nevo-devo – like those on how development biases evolution\n(Radersma et al. forthcoming), how novel variation arises through\ndevelopmental plasticity (Pigliucci 2001, Gilbert 2006), and how\norganisms generate heritable, adaptive phenotypic variation\n(evolvability; see Brown 2014) – significantly expand the\nstandard analysis of decomposition and localization by dynamical\nmodels (see also Bechtel & Abrahamsen 2010; Brigandt 2013; Baedke\n2020). These models allow predicting the dynamics of developing\nsystems. After decomposing a system and identifying causal\ncontributions of parts or sub-systems, dynamical models help to\ndemonstrate how these contributions operate together to bring about a\nwhole system’s behavior. In this way, they answer how\ndevelopmental mechanisms create evolutionary relevant qualitative\nchanges in phenotypic properties, like robustness, phenotypic\nplasticity, and modularity, through underlying quantitative changes in\ntheir component parts and activities. One classical example of this\nare mathematical models on the robustness of spatial pattering and\nsegmentation in Drosophila. They provide quantitative\ninformation about the interaction of underlying gene network\ncomponents, including, for example, gene transcription rates and decay\nrates of gene products (von Dassow et al. 2000). \nOther discussions on the interface between development and evolution\nfocus on the structure of explanations that address how developmental\nmechanisms evolve. Calcott (2009, 2013) has argues that Mayr’s\ndistinction characterizes two kinds of explanation: developmental\nexplanation that answers ‘How do individuals work\nat a time?’ and evolutionary explanation that answers\n‘How do populations change over time?’\nHowever, there is a third kind, called ‘lineage\nexplanation’. Lineage explanation differs from the above by\nanswering ‘How do individuals change over\ntime?’ Therefore, they offer a series of mechanistic\nmodels, which trace differences between the developmental mechanisms\nof individuals that produce the relevant morphological structures at\ndifferent times. Over evolutionary time, these relations undergo small\nmodifications, which ultimately bring about novelties, like eyes and\nfeathers, in the whole system. Thus, lineage explanation expands the\nstandards philosophical framework from a single description of a\nmechanism into a series of mechanistic models. \nBesides these debates about the structure of biological mechanisms and\ntheir role in explaining developmental evolution, philosophers of\nbiology and biologists have discussed, more generally, which virtue\ndevelopmental explanations (could) have for addressing evolutionary\nphenomena. Related to this issue is the question how much – in\nthe sense of what kind of facts – natural selection alone can\nexplain (see the entry\n adaptationism).\n It is widely accepted that such explanations can address the general\ndynamics of trait frequencies and survival (see Sober 1984). However,\nwhether this also holds for addressing in more detail the development\nof particular traits of individuals is an unsettled issue. While some\nauthors claim that evolutionary explanations by natural selection can\nexplain why a particular individual has a certain trait rather than\nanother trait (Neander 1995; Forber 2005) others deny this (Sober\n1984; Stegmann 2010). What is more, it has been argued that\nintegrating explanations of developmental phenomena, like\ndevelopmental bias, phenotypic plasticity, niche construction, and inclusive inheritance, to the explanatory framework of evolutionary\ntheory would lead to a “significantly expanded explanatory\ncapacity” of this theory (Pigliucci & Müller 2010: 12).\nHowever, while there is often agreement in evolutionary biology over\nthe existence of these developmental phenomena (Laland et al. 2014;\nWray et al. 2014), their explanatory relevance is questioned. Against\nthis background, scholars have begun analyzing based on which criteria\nof explanatory power, like precision, proportionality, sensitivity,\nand idealization, developmentalist evolutionary explanations are\nbetter than selectionist explanations. This includes identifying,\nwhich tradeoffs between explanatory standards (e.g., between precision\nand sensitivity or idealization) those accounts face that seek to\nintegrate developmental and evolutionary explanations (Baedke et al.\n2020b; Uller et al. 2020). \nThe above debates about the relationship between evolution and\ndevelopment primarily emerged within philosophy of science, especially\nin history and philosophy of biology. However, there are other, more\ngeneral debates about anthropological and ethical issues that concern\ndevelopmental evolution. The primarily refer to how we conceptualize\ndeveloping and evolving humans, their life, body and health, as well\nas how we assign responsibilities for health care interventions. \nFirst, new findings in the plasticity of developing organism, their\ninterconnectedness, and modes of transgenerational transmission of\ninformation have affected scientific and public understandings of what\nhumans are. For example, if humans are conceptualized as holobionts\n– as collectives of co-developing and co-evolving organisms\n– this also means that development is a matter of\nco-construction, of interactions between species. It means, as Haraway\n(2016) has phrased it, that we – as humans – very\nliterally ‘become with others.’ In this context,\nsympoiesis (developmental symbiosis) means that development is\nco-development. Against this background, John Dupré and Maureen\nO'Malley (2009) see living entities as interactive collections:\n“Life, we claim, is typically found at the collaborative\nintersections of many lineages, and we even suggest that collaboration\nshould be seen as a central characteristic of living\nmatter”. \nSecond, biological and biophilosophical debates on developmental\nevolution and organisms’ plasticity and environmental\nresponsiveness have informed debates on what the human body is. For\nexample, Jörg Niewöhner (2011) states that a new concept of\nthe human body is currently emerging in modern biology, the so-called\n‘embedded body’. According to this view, the human body is\nno longer a machine-like unit, which is genetically programmed,\nneurally controlled and bounded by the skin, but an open and dynamic\nunit which cannot be grasped in isolation from its material and social\nenvironment (see also Baedke 2017). Additionally, the body is embedded\ninto different time scales ranging from its evolutionary and\ntransgenerational to ontogenetic past, which permanently constitute\nits present. Others have argued, against the standard human birth\nnarrative and Aristotle, who defined the temporal boundaries of\nindividuals at birth and death, that birth in humans is not the\ncreation of a new individual. Instead, birth should be understood as\nthe origin of a new multi-species collective (Gilbert 2014; Chiu &\nGilbert 2015). \nAnother anthropological issue arising from recent research in evo-devo\nand epigenetics is, third, the question how to define normality and\nhealth in humans (see Baedke 2019b). There is evidence that bacteria\nare needed for our normal cognitive and social development. For\nexample, germ-free mice are asocial and have autistic-like behavior\n(Desbonnet et al. 2014) and this behavior can be replicated by\nimplanting the microbiome from autistic patients (but not control\npatients) into germ-free mice (Sharon et al. 2019). Such cases suggest\nthat biological normality is not as intrinsic property to organisms\nbut emerges through interconnections with other organisms and the\nenvironment. In addition, our understanding of health is increasingly\nchallenged. This especially refers to the view that describes human\nhealth as freedom and autonomy from external interference. It usually\nsees bacteria as deviations from the norm and parasitism as\npathological, because it threatens and contaminates the purity of the\nindividual’s energy pattern. Instead, in a (more processual)\nholobiontic framework, microbes are needed for normal development and\nare thought to prevent the development of certain diseases (Bello et\nal. 2018; Kirjavainen et al. 2019). In addition, certain entities,\nbacteria or viruses, previously thought to be harmful, are now\nincreasingly considered to be ‘good’ or\n‘healthy’ collaborators, not ‘bad intruders’\n(Dupré & Guttinger 2016). In more general term, this means\nthat since microbiota are increasingly recognized as important\ncomponents that stabilize normal development and co-evolve with\nhumans, they therefore carry traits crucial for humans’ fitness,\ni.e., health. This new perspective could lead to radical changes in\npersonalized surveillance and treatment of disease, and, more\ngenerally, to new strategies in policy making, which replace the idea\nof preserving the autonomous individual from contamination by the idea\nof maintaining (equilibrium states of) collectives of co-developing\nand co-evolving individuals. \nFinally, on a more ethical dimension, these findings about\nhumans’ openness to their environments and to one another has\nled, first, to discussions about who takes responsibilities for\nhumans’ health states and interventions (e.g., on epigenomes and\nmicrobiomes) on intra- and transgenerational timescales (Dupras &\nRavitsky 2016). If plastic development can shape evolution, who is\nresponsible for developmental outcomes and evolutionary trajectories\nin humans? Should the individual being as the central heath care\nagent, which is ‘freed from the chains of its genes’\n(Pickersgill et al. 2013), take this responsibility? Or should\ncollectives, such as national states or international bodies, be\nresponsible for levels of toxins in the environment as well as for the\nfood individuals eat and stress they are exposed to (Hedlund 2012)?\nThe latter account of responsibility aims to prevent overemphasizing\nthe causal role of mothers as the most central public health care\nagents who should be held accountable (and guilty) if their children\nor later generations become sick (Richardson et al. 2014). \nThe relationship between evolution and development has been a long\ndebated topic in the history of biology and philosophy of biology.\nThis entry has sampled a small portion of work relevant to the\nconceptual, epistemological, anthropological and ethical reflections\non this relationship. Besides the issues discussed here, philosophers\nof biology and biologists have discussed how developmental and\nphylogenetic approaches to homology can be integrated (Amundson 2004;\nWagner 2014; DiFrisco 2019; see the entry\n developmental biology),\n what model organisms (Love 2009; Lloyd et al. 2012; Minelli & Baedke 2014; Zuk et al.\n2014; see entry\n developmental biology)\n and representational tools scientists (should) use for studying\nrelationships between evolution and development (e.g., normal plates,\ncell fate maps, epigenetic landscapes) and what the epistemic and\nheuristic roles of these tools in scientific practice are (see Haraway\n1976; Gilbert 1991; Hopwood 2007; Love 2010; Baedke 2013; Baedke &\nSchöttler 2017; Nicoglou 2018). In addition, long standing\ndebates on teleology in biology (see the entry\n teleological notions in biology)\n drew on the relation between evolution and development to distinguish\nthe teleological dimension of development from non-teleological\nevolutionary processes (Mayr 1961), to introduce new conceptual\nframeworks, like teleonomy, which refer to only apparently purposeful\nsystems (Pittendrigh 1958), or to highlight the purposeful acting\norganismic agent as a starting point to reason about the teleological\nnature of evolution (Russell 1950; Piaget 1976 [1978]; Walsh\n2015). \nAt the moment, philosophical debates about the appropriate conceptual\nand explanatory approach to combine or integrate developmental and\nevolutionary processes have not reached a consensus. This is not least\ndue to the fact that the relevant disciplinary fields, such as\nevo-devo, epigenetics and niche construction theory, which foster such\nintegration, are still relatively young. Their theoretical and\nconceptual frameworks are highly heterogeneous. Thus, important aims\nfor future philosophical research is to understand obstacles for the\nstabilization and solidification of these frameworks, to identify\ntheir explanatory virtues and limitations, as well as to call\nattention to their effects on how we understand humans and human\nhealth.
