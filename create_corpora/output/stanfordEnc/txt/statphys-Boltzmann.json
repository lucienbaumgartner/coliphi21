Particularly\nfamous is his statistical explanation of the second law of\nthermodynamics. The celebrated formula \\(S = k \\log W\\), expressing a\nrelation between entropy \\(S\\) and probability \\(W\\) has been engraved\non his tombstone (even though he never actually wrote this formula\ndown). Boltzmann's views on statistical physics continue to play an\nimportant role in contemporary debates on the foundations of that\ntheory.\n\n\n\nHowever, Boltzmann's ideas on the precise relationship between the\nthermodynamical properties of macroscopic bodies and their microscopic\nconstitution, and the role of probability in this relationship are\ninvolved and differed quite remarkably in different periods of his\nlife. Indeed, in his first paper in statistical physics of 1866, he\nclaimed to obtain a completely general theorem from mechanics that\nwould prove the second law. However, thirty years later he stated that\nthe second law could never be proved by mechanical means alone, but\ndepended essentially on probability theory. In his lifelong struggle\nwith the problem he employed a varying arsenal of tools and\nassumptions. (To mention a few: the so-called Stoßzahlansatz,\nthe ergodic hypothesis, ensembles, the combinatorial argument, the\nhypothesis of molecular disorder.) However, the exact role of these\nassumptions, and the results he obtained from them, also shifted in\nthe course of time.  Particularly notorious are the role of the\nergodic hypothesis and the status of the so-called H-theorem.\nMoreover, he used ‘probability’ in four different\ntechnical meanings.  It is, therefore, not easy to speak of a\nconsistent, single “Boltzmannian approach” to statistical physics. It\nis the purpose of this essay to describe the evolution of a selection\nof these approaches and their conceptual problems.\n\n\n\nBoltzmann's work met with mixed reactions during his lifetime, and\ncontinue to do so even today. It may be worthwhile, therefore, to\ndevote a few remarks to the perception and reception of his work. \n\nBoltzmann is often portrayed as a staunch defender of the atomic view\nof matter, at a time when the dominant opinion in the German-speaking\nphysics community, led by influential authors like Mach and Ostwald,\ndisapproved of this view. Indeed, the story goes, in the late\nnineteenth century any attempt at all to search for a hypothetical,\nmicrophysical underpinning of macroscopic phenomena was regarded as\nsuspicious. Further, serious criticism on his work was raised by\nLoschmidt and Zermelo. Various passages in Boltzmann's writing,\nespecially in the late 1890s, complain that his work was hardly\nnoticed (entitling one article “On some of my lesser-known papers on\ngas theory and their relation to the same” (1879b) or even about a\n“hostile attitude” (1898a, v) towards gas theory, and of his awareness\nof “being a powerless individual struggling against the currents of\nthe time” (ibid.). \n\nThus, the myth has arisen that Boltzmann was ignored or resisted by\nhis\n contemporaries.[1]\n Sometimes, his suicide in 1906 is attributed to the injustice he thus\nsuffered, The fact that his death occurred just at the dawn of the\ndefinitive victory of the atomic view in the works of Einstein,\nSmoluchowski, Perrin et al. adds a further touch of drama to this\npicture. \n\nAs a matter of fact, Boltzmann's reputation as a theoretical physicist\nwas actually widely known and well-respected. In 1888 he was offered\n(but declined, after a curious sequence of negotiations) a most\nprestigious chair in Berlin. Later, several universities (Vienna,\nMunich, Leipzig) competed to get him appointed, sometimes putting the\nsalaries of several professorships together in their effort (Lindley\n2001). He was elected to membership or honorary membership in many\nacademies (cf. Höflechner 1994, 192), received honorary doctorates,\nand was also awarded various medals. In short, there is no factual\nevidence for the claim that Boltzmann was ignored or suffered any\nunusual lack of recognition from his contemporaries. His suicide seems\nto have been due to factors in his personal life (depressions and\ndecline of health) rather than to any academic matters.\n \n\nBoltzmann was involved in various disputes. But this is not to say\nthat he was the innocent victim of hostilities. In many cases he took\nthe initiative by launching a polemic attack on his colleagues. I will\nfocus below on the most important disputes: with Mach and Ostwald on\nthe reality of atoms; and with colleagues who criticized Boltzmann's\nown work in the form of the famous reversibility objection (Loschmidt)\nand the recurrence objection (Zermelo). For a wider sketch of how\ncontemporary scientists took position in the debate on the topics of\nmechanism and irreversibility I refer to (van Strien 2013).   \n\nOstwald and Mach clearly resisted the atomic view of matter (although\nfor different reasons). Boltzmann certainly defended and promoted this\nview. But he was not the naive realist or unabashed believer in the\nexistence of atoms that the more popular literature has made of\nhim. Instead, he stressed from the 1880s onwards that the atomic view\nyielded at best an analogy, or a picture or model of reality (cf. de\nRegt 1999).  In his debate with Mach he advocated (1897c, 1897d) this\napproach as a useful or economical way to understand the thermal\nbehavior of gases. This means that his views were quite compatible\nwith Mach's views on the goal of \n science.[2]\n What divided them was more a\nstrategic issue. Boltzmann claimed that no approach in natural science\nthat avoids hypotheses completely could ever succeed. He argued that\nthose who reject the atomic hypothesis in favor of a continuum view of\nmatter were guilty of adopting hypotheses too. Ultimately, the choice\nbetween such views should depend on their fruitfulness, and here\nBoltzmann had no doubt that the atomic hypothesis would be\n more\n successful.[3] \n\nIn the case of Ostwald, and his ‘energetics’, Boltzmann\ndid become involved in a more heated dispute at a meeting in\nLübeck in 1895.  Roughly speaking, energetics presented a\nconception of nature that took energy as the most fundamental physical\nentity, and thus represented physical processes as transformations of\nvarious forms of energy. It resisted attempts to comprehend energy, or\nthese transformations in terms of mechanical pictures. \n\nIt has been suggested that in the 1890s “the adherents of energetics\nreigned supreme in the German school and even throughout Europe”\n(Dugas 1959, 82). But this is surely a great exaggeration. It seems\ncloser to the truth to say that energetics represented a rather small\n(but vocal) minority in the physics community, that claimed to put\nforward a seemingly attractive conception of natural science, and\nbeing promoted in the mid-90s by reputed scientists, could no longer\nbe dismissed as the work of amateurs (cf. Deltete 1999). \n\nThe 1895 gathering of the Naturforscherversammlung in\nLübeck (the annual meeting of physicists, chemists, biologists\nand physicians) was programmed to devote special sessions to the state\nof the art of energetics. Boltzmann, who was member of the programme\ncommittee, had already shown interest in the development of energetics\nin private correspondence with Ostwald. Georg Helm was asked to\nprepare a report, and at Boltzmann's own suggestion, Ostwald also\ncontributed a lecture.  All agreed that the meeting should follow the\n“British style”, i.e.,  manuscripts would be circulated beforehand and\nthere would be ample room for discussion, following the example of the\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science meeting that\nBoltzmann had attended the previous year. \n\nBoth Helm and Ostwald, apparently, anticipated that they would have\nthe opportunity to discuss their views on energetics in an open-minded\natmosphere. But at the meeting Boltzmann surprised them with\ndevastating criticism. According to those who were present Boltzmann\nwas the clear winner of the\n debate.[4] \n Yet the energeticists experienced the confrontation as an ambush\n(Höflechner 1994, I, 169), for which he had not been\nprepared. Nevertheless, Boltzmann and Ostwald remained friends, and in\n1902 Ostwald made a great effort to persuade his home university in\nLeipzig to appoint Boltzmann (cf. Blackmore 1995, 61–65). \n\nNeither is there any hostile attitude in the famous\n‘reversibility objection’ by Loschmidt in 1875. Loschmidt\nwas Boltzmann's former teacher and later colleague at the University\nof Vienna, and a life-long friend. He had no philosophical\nreservations against the existence of atoms at all. (Indeed, he is\nbest known for his estimate of their size.) Rather, his main objection\nwas against the prediction by Maxwell and Boltzmann that a gas column\nin thermal equilibrium in a gravitational field has the same\ntemperature at all heights. His now famous reversibility objection\narose in his attempts to undermine this prediction. Whether Boltzmann\nsucceeded in refuting the objection or not is still a matter of\ndispute, as we shall see below (section 4.1). \n\nZermelo's opposition had a quite different background. When he put\nforward the recurrence objection in 1896, he was an assistant\nto Planck in Berlin. And like his mentor, he did not favor the\nmechanical underpinning of thermal phenomena. Yet his 1896 paper\n(Zermelo 1896a) is by no means hostile.  It presents a careful logical\nargument that leads him to a dilemma: thermodynamics with its Second\nLaw on the one hand and gas theory (in the form as Zermelo understood\nit) on the other cannot both be literally true.  By contrast, it is\nBoltzmann's (1896b) reaction to Zermelo, drenched in sarcasm and\nbitterness which (if anything) may have led to hostile feelings\nbetween these two authors. In any case, the tone of Zermelo's (1896b)\nis considerably sharper.  Still, Zermelo maintained a keen, yet\ncritical, interest in gas theory and statistical physics, and\nsubsequently played an important role in making Gibbs' work known in\nGermany. \n\nIn fact, I think that Boltzmann's rather aggressive reactions to\nZermelo and Ostwald should be compared to other polemical exchanges in\nwhich he was involved, and sometimes initiated himself (e.g. against\nClausius, Tait, Planck, and Bertrand — not to mention his essay on\nSchopenhauer). It seems to me that Boltzmann enjoyed polemics, and the\nuse of sharp language for rhetorical \n effect.[5] \n Boltzmann's complaints in 1896–1898 about an hostile environment are,\nI think, partly explained by his love of polemic exaggerations, partly\nalso by his mental depression in that period. (See Höflechner\n1994, 198–202) for details.) Certainly, the debates with Ostwald\nand Zermelo might well have contributed to this personal crisis. But\nit would be wrong to interpret Boltzmann's plaintive moods as evidence\nthat his critics were, in fact, hostile. \n\nEven today, commentators on Boltzmann's works are divided in their\nopinion. Some praise them as brilliant and exceptionally clear. Often\none finds passages suggesting he possessed all the right answers all\nalong the way — or at least in his later writings, while his\ncritics were simply prejudiced, confused or misguided (von Plato,\nLebowitz, Kac, Bricmont, Goldstein). Others (Ehrenfests, Klein,\nTruesdell) have emphasized that Boltzmann's work is not always clear\nand that he often failed to indicate crucial assumptions or important\nchanges in his position, while friendly critics helped him in\nclarifying and developing his views. \n\nFans and critics of Boltzmann's work alike agree that he pioneered\nmuch of the approaches currently used in statistical physics, but also\nthat he did not leave behind a unified coherent theory. His scientific\npapers, collected in Wissenschaftliche Abhandlungen, contain\nmore than 100 papers on statistical physics alone. Some of these\npapers are forbiddingly long, full of tedious calculations and lack a\nclear coherent structure. Sometimes, vital assumptions, or even a\ncomplete change of approach, are stated only somewhere tucked away\nbetween the calculations, or at the very last page. Even Maxwell, who\nmight have been in the best position to appreciate Boltzmann's work,\nexpressed his difficulty with Boltzmann's longwindedness (in a letter\nto Tait, August 1873; see Garber, Brush, and Everett 1995,\n123).[6] But not\nall of his prose is cumbersome and heavy-going. Boltzmann at his best\ncould be witty, passionate and a delight to read. He excelled in such\nqualities in much of his popular work and some of his polemical\narticles. \n\nThe foundations of statistical physics may today be characterized as a\nbattlefield between a dozen or so different schools, each firmly dug\ninto their own trenches, e.g.: ergodic theory, coarse-graining, the\napproaches of Markovianism, interventionism, BBKGY, or Jaynes,\nPrigogine, etc. Still, many of the protagonists of these schools,\nregardless of their disagreements, frequently express their debt to\nideas first formulated to Boltzmann. Even to those who consider the\nconcept of ensembles as the most important tool of statistical\nphysics, and claim Gibbs rather than Boltzmann as their champion, it\nhas been pointed out that Boltzmann introduced ensembles long before\nGibbs. And those who advocate Boltzmann while rejecting ergodic\ntheory, may similarly be reminded that the latter theory too\noriginated with Boltzmann himself. \n\nIt appears, therefore, that Boltzmann is the father of many\napproaches, even if these approaches are presently seen as conflicting\nwith each other. This is due to the fact that during his forty years of\nwork on the subject, Boltzmann pursued many lines of thought.\nTypically, he would follow a particular train of thought that he regarded\npromising and fruitful, only to discard it in the next paper for\nanother one, and then pick it up again years later. This meandering\napproach is of course not unusual among theoretical physicists but it\nmakes it hard to pin down Boltzmann on a particular set of rock-bottom\nassumptions, that would reveal his true colors in the modern debate on\nthe foundations of statistical physics. The Ehrenfests (1912) in their\nfamous Encyclopedia article, set themselves the task of constructing a\nmore or less coherent framework out of Boltzmann's legacy. But their\npresentation of Boltzmann was, as is rather well known, not\nhistorically adequate. \n\nWithout going into a more detailed description of the landscape of the\nbattlefield of the foundations of statistical physics, or a sketch of\nthe various positions occupied, it might be useful to mention only the\nroughest of distinctions. I use the term ‘statistical\nphysics’ as a deliberately vague term that includes at least two\nmore sharply distinguished theories: the kinetic theory of gases and\nstatistical mechanics proper. \n\nThe first theory aims to explain the properties of gases by assuming\nthat they consist of a very large number of molecules in rapid motion.\n(The term ‘kinetic’ is meant to underline the vital\nimportance of motion here, and to distinguish the approach from older\nstatic molecular gas models.) During the 1860s probability\nconsiderations were imported into this theory. The aim then became to\ncharacterize the properties of gases, in particular in thermal\nequilibrium, in terms of probabilities of various molecular\nstates. This is what the Ehrenfests call “kineto-statistics of the\nmolecule”. Here, molecular states, in particular their velocities, are\nregarded as stochastic variables, and probabilities are attached to\nsuch molecular states of motion. These probabilities themselves are\nconceived of as mechanical properties of the state of the total gas\nsystem. Either they represent the relative number of\nmolecules with a particular state, or the relative time\nduring which a molecule has that state. \n\nIn the course of time a transition was made to what the Ehrenfests\ncalled “kineto-statistics of the gas model”, or what is nowadays\nknown as statistical mechanics. In this latter approach, probabilities\nare not attached to the state of a molecule but of the entire gas\nsystem. Thus, the state of the gas, instead of determining the\nprobability distribution, now itself becomes a stochastic variable. \n\nA merit of this latter approach is that interactions between molecules\ncan be taken into account. Indeed, the approach is not restricted to\ngases, but also applicable to liquids or solids. The price to be paid,\nhowever, is that the probabilities themselves become more\nabstract. Since probabilities are attributed to the mechanical states\nof the total system, they are no longer determined by such mechanical\nstates. Instead, in statistical mechanics, the probabilities are\nusually determined by means of an ‘ensemble’, i.e., a\nfictitious collection of replicas of the system in question. \n\nIt is not easy to pinpoint this transition in the course of history,\nexcept to say that in Maxwell's work in the 1860s definitely belong to\nthe first category, and Gibbs' book of 1902 to the second. Boltzmann's\nown works fall somewhere in the middle. His earlier contributions\nclearly belong to the kinetic theory of gases (although his 1868 paper\nalready applies probability to an entire gas system), while his work\nof 1877 is usually seen as belonging to statistical\nmechanics. However, Boltzmann himself never indicated a clear\ndistinction between these two different theories, and any attempt to\ndraw a demarcation at an exact location in his work seems somewhat\narbitrary. \n\nFrom a conceptual point of view, the transition from kinetic gas\ntheory to statistical mechanics poses two main foundational questions.\nOn what grounds do we choose a particular ensemble, or the probability\ndistribution characterizing the system? Gibbs did not enter into a\nsystematic discussion of this problem, but only discussed special\ncases of equilibrium ensembles (i.e. canonical, micro-canonical\netc.). A second problem is to relate the ensemble-based probabilities\nwith the probabilities obtained in the earlier kinetic approach for a\nsingle gas model. \n\nThe Ehrenfests (1912) paper was the first to recognize these\nquestions, and to provide a partial answer: Assuming a certain\nhypothesis of Boltzmann's, which they dubbed the ergodic\nhypothesis, they pointed out that for an isolated system the\nmicro-canonical distribution is the unique stationary probability\ndistribution. Hence, if one demands that an ensemble of isolated\nsystems describing thermal equilibrium must be represented by a\nstationary distribution, the only choice for this purpose is the\nmicro-canonical one. Similarly, they pointed out that under the\nergodic hypothesis infinite time averages and ensemble averages were\nidentical. This, then, would provide a desired link between the\nprobabilities of the older kinetic gas theory and those of statistical\nmechanics, at least in equilibrium and in the infinite time limit. Yet\nthe Ehrenfests simultaneously expressed strong doubts about the\nvalidity of the ergodic hypothesis. These doubts were soon\nsubstantiated when in 1913 Rozenthal and Plancherel proved that the\nhypothesis was untenable for realistic gas models. \n\nThe Ehrenfests' reconstruction of Boltzmann's work thus gave a\nprominent role to the ergodic hypothesis, suggesting that it played a\nfundamental and lasting role in his thinking. Although this view\nindeed produces a more coherent view of his multifaceted work, it is\ncertainly not historically correct. Boltzmann himself also had grave\ndoubts about this hypothesis, and expressly avoided it whenever he\ncould, in particular in his two great papers of 1872 and 1877b. Since\nthe Ehrenfests, many other authors have presented accounts of\nBoltzmann's work. Particularly important are Klein (1973) and Brush\n(1976). Still, much confusion remains about what exactly his approach\nto statistical physics was, and how it developed. For a more elaborate\nattempt to sketch the general landscape, and Boltzmann's work in\nparticular,I refer to (Uffink 2007).  \n\nRoughly speaking, one may divide Boltzmann's work in four periods. The\nperiod 1866–1871 is more or less his formative period. In his first\npaper (1866), Boltzmann set himself the problem of deriving the full\nsecond law from mechanics. The notion of probability does not appear\nin this paper. The following papers, from 1868 and 1871, were written\nafter Boltzmann had read Maxwell's work of 1860 and 1867. Following\nMaxwell's example, they deal with the characterization of a gas in\nthermal equilibrium, in terms of a probability distribution. Even\nthen, he was set on obtaining more general results, and extended the\ndiscussion to cases where the gas is subject to a static external\nforce, and might consist of poly-atomic molecules. He regularly\nswitched between different conceptions of probability: sometimes this\nreferred to a time average, sometimes a particle average or, in an\nexceptional paper (1871b), it referred to an ensemble average. The\nmain result of those papers is that from the so-called\nStoßzahlansatz (SZA), i.e. an assumption about the\nnumber of collisions (or a closely analogous assumption) the\nMaxwellian distribution function is stationary, and thus an\nappropriate candidate for the equilibrium state. In some cases\nBoltzmann also argued it was the unique such state. \n\nHowever, in this period he also presented a completely different\nmethod, which did not rely on the SZA but rather on the ergodic\nhypothesis. This approach led to a new form of the distribution\nfunction that, in the limit \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\) reduces to the\nMaxwellian form. In the same period, he also introduced the concept of\nensembles, but this concept would not play a prominent role in his\nthinking until the 1880s. \n\nThe next period is that of 1872–1878, in which he wrote his two most\nfamous papers: (1872) (Weitere Studien) and\n(1877b) (Über die Beziehung). The 1872\npaper contained the Boltzmann equation and the\nH-theorem. Boltzmann claimed that the H-theorem\nprovided the desired theorem from mechanics corresponding to the\nsecond law. However, this claim came under a serious objection due to\nLoschmidt's criticism of 1876. The objection was simply that no purely\nmechanical theorem could ever produce a time-asymmetrical\nresult. Boltzmann's response to this objection will be summarized\nlater. \n\nThe result was, however, that Boltzmann rethought the basis of his\napproach and in 1877b produced a conceptually very different analysis,\nwhich might be called the combinatorial argument, of\nequilibrium and evolutions towards equilibrium, and the role of\nprobability theory. The distribution function, which formerly\nrepresented the probability distribution, was now conceived of as a\nstochastic variable (nowadays called a macrostate) subject to a\nprobability distribution. That probability distribution was now\ndetermined by the size of the volume in phase space corresponding to\nall the microstates giving rise to the same macrostate, (essentially\ngiven by calculating all permutations of the particles in a given\nmacrostate). Equilibrium was now conceived of as the most probable\nmacrostate instead of a stationary macrostate. The evolution towards\nequilibrium could then be reformulated as an evolution from less\nprobable to more probable states. \n\nEven though all commentators agree on the importance of these two\npapers, there is still disagreement about what Boltzmann's claims\nactually were, and whether he succeeded (or indeed even attempted) in\navoiding the reversibility objection in this new combinatorial\nargument, whether he intended or succeeded to prove that most\nevolutions go from less probable to more probable states and whether\nor not he (implicitly) relied on the ergodic hypothesis in these\nworks. I shall comment on these issues in due course. (See Uffink\n(2007) for a more detailed overview.) \n\nThe third period is taken up by the papers Boltzmann wrote during\nthe 1880's have attracted much less attention. During this period, he\nabandoned the combinatorial argument, and went back to an approach that\nrelied on a combination of the ergodic hypothesis and the use of\nensembles. For a while Boltzmann worked on an application of this\napproach to Helmholtz's concept of monocyclic systems. However, after\nfinding that concept did not always provide the desired thermodynamical\nanalogies, he abandoned this topic again. \n\nNext, in the 1890s the reversibility problem resurfaced again, this\ntime in a debate in the columns of Nature.  This time\nBoltzmann chose an entirely different line of counterargument than in\nhis debate with Loschmidt. A few years later, Zermelo presented\nanother objection, now called the recurrence objection. The same\nperiod also saw the publication of the two volumes of his Lectures\non Gas Theory. In this book, he takes the hypothesis of molecular\ndisorder (a close relative of the SZA) as the basis of his\napproach. The combinatorial argument is only discussed as an aside,\nand the ergodic hypothesis is not mentioned at all. His last paper is\nan Encyclopedia article with Nabl presenting a survey of kinetic\ntheory. \n\nBoltzmann's first paper (1866) in statistical physics aimed to reduce\nthe second law to mechanics. Within the next two years he became\nacquainted with Maxwell's papers on gas theory of 1860 and 1867, which\nintroduced probability notions in the description of the gas. Maxwell\nhad studied specific mechanical models for a gas (as a system of hard\nspheres (1860) or of point particles exerting a mutual force on each\nother inversely proportional to the fifth power of their distance),\nand characterized the state of such a gas by means of a probability\ndistribution f over the various values of the molecular\nvelocities \\(\\vec{v}\\). For Maxwell, the probability\n\\(f(\\vec{v})d^3\\vec{v}\\) denoted the relative number of particles in\nthe gas with a velocity between \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{v} +\nd^3\\vec{v}\\).  In particular, he had argued that the state of\nequilibrium is characterized by the so-called Maxwell distribution\nfunction:  \n where \\(A\\) is a normalization constant and \\(B\\) is proportional to\nthe absolute temperature.  \n\nThe argument that Maxwell had given in 1860 to single out this\ndistribution relied on the fact that this is the only probability\ndistribution that is both spherically symmetric and factorizes into\nfunctions of the orthogonal components \\(v_x, v_y, v_z\\)\nseparately. In 1867, however he replaced these desiderata with the\nmore natural requirement that the equilibrium distribution should be\nstationary, i.e. it should not change shape as a result of the\ncontinual collisions between the particles. This called for a more\nelaborate argument, involving a detailed consideration of the\ncollisions between particles. The crucial assumption in this argument\nis what is now known as the SZA. Roughly speaking, it states that the\nnumber of particle pairs, \\(dN(\\vec{v}_1, \\vec{v}_2)\\) with initial\nvelocities between \\(\\vec{v}_1\\) and \\(\\vec{v}_1 + d^3\\vec{v}_1\\) and\nbetween \\(\\vec{v}_2\\) and \\(\\vec{v}_2 + d^3\\vec{v}_2\\) respectively,\nwhich are about to collide in a time span \\(dt\\) is proportional\nto \n where the proportionality constant depends on the geometry of the\ncollision and the relative velocity. For Maxwell, and Boltzmann later,\nthis assumption seemed almost self-evident. One ought to note,\nhowever, that by choosing the initial, rather than the final\nvelocities of the collision, the assumption introduced an explicit\ntime-asymmetric element. This, however, was not noticed until\n1895. Maxwell showed that, under the SZA, the distribution (1) is\nindeed stationary. He also argued, but much less convincingly, that it\nshould be the only stationary distribution. \n\nIn his (1868), Boltzmann set out to apply this argument to a variety\nof other models (including gases in a static external force field).\nHowever, Boltzmann started out with a somewhat different\ninterpretation of probability in mind than Maxwell. For him,\n\\(f(\\vec{v})d^3\\vec{v}\\) is introduced firstly as the relative time\nduring which a (given) particle has a velocity between \\(\\vec{v}\\) and\n\\(\\vec{v} + d^3\\vec{v}\\) (WA I, 50).  But, in the same breath, he\nidentifies this with the relative number of particles with this\nvelocity. This equivocation between different meanings of probability\nreturned again and again in Boltzmann's\nwriting.[7] Either\nway, of course, whether we average over time or particles,\nprobabilities are defined here in strictly mechanical terms, and\ntherefore objective properties of the gas. Yet apart from this\nstriking difference in interpretation, the first section of the paper\nis a straightforward continuation of the ideas Maxwell had developed\nin his 1867. In particular, the main ingredient is always played by\nthe SZA, or a version of that assumption suitably modified for the\ncase discussed. \n\nBut in the last section of the paper he suddenly shifts course. He now\nfocuses on a general Hamiltonian system, i.e., a system of N\nmaterial points with an arbitrary interaction potential. The state of\nthis system may be represented as a phase point \\(x =\n(\\vec{p}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{p}_N,\\vec{q}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{q}_N)\\) in the\nmechanical phase space \\(\\Gamma\\). By the Hamiltonian equations of\nmotion, this point evolves in time, and thus describes a trajectory\n\\(x_t\\). This trajectory is constrained to lie on a given energy\nhypersurface \\(H(x) = E\\), where \\(H(x)\\) denotes the Hamiltonian\nfunction. \n\nNow consider an arbitrary probability density \\(\\rho(x)\\) over this\nphase space. He shows, by (what is now known as) Liouville's theorem,\nthat \\(\\rho\\) remains constant along a trajectory, i.e., \\(\\rho(x_0) =\n\\rho(x_t)\\). Assuming now for simplicity that all points in a given\nenergy hypersurface lie on a single trajectory, the probability should\nbe a constant over the energy hypersurface. In other words, the only\nstationary probability with fixed total energy is the microcanonical\ndistribution. where \\(\\delta\\) is Dirac's delta function. \n\nBy integrating this expression over all momenta but one, and dividing\nthis by the integral of \\(\\rho_{mc}\\) over all momenta, Boltzmann\nobtained the marginal probability density \\(\\rho_{mc}(\\vec{p}_1 \\mid\n\\vec{q}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{q}_N)\\) for particle 1's momentum,\nconditionalized on the particle positions\n\\(\\vec{q}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{q}_N\\).  He then showed that this marginal\nprobability distribution tends to the Maxwell distribution when the\nnumber of particles tends to infinity. \n\nSome comments on this result. \n\nFirst, the difference between the approach relying on the ergodic\nhypothesis and that relying on the SZA is rather striking. Instead of\nconcentrating on a specific gas model, Boltzmann here assumes a much\nmore general model with an arbitrary interaction potential\n\\(V(\\vec{q}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{q}_N)\\).  Moreover, the probability density\n\\(\\rho\\) is defined over phase space, instead of the space of\nmolecular velocities. This is the first occasion where probability\nconsiderations are applied to the state of the mechanical system as\nwhole, instead of its individual particles. If the transition between\nkinetic gas theory and statistical mechanics may be identified with\nthis caesura, (as argued by the Ehrenfests and by Klein) it would seem\nthat the transition has already been made right here in 1868, rather\nthan only in 1877.  \n\nBut of course, for Boltzmann the transition did not involve a major\nconceptual move, thanks to his conception of probability as a relative\ntime. Thus, the probability of a particular state of the total system\nis still identified with the fraction of time in which that state is\noccupied by the system. In other words, he had no need for ensembles or\nnon-mechanical probabilistic assumptions in this paper. \n\nHowever, note that the equivocation between relative times and\nrelative numbers, which was relatively harmless in the first section\nof the 1868 paper, is no longer possible in the interpretation of\n\\(\\rho\\). The probability \\(\\rho_{mc}(\\vec{p}_1 \\mid\n\\vec{q}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{q}_N) d^3\\vec{p}_1\\) gives us the relative time\nthat the total system is in a state for which particle 1 has a\nmomentum between \\(\\vec{p}_1\\) and \\(\\vec{p}_1 + d^3\\vec{p}_1\\), for\ngiven values of all positions. There is no route back to infer that\nthis has anything to do with the relative number of particles with\nthis momentum. \n\nSecond, and more importantly, these results open up a perspective of great\ngenerality. It suggests that the probability of the molecular\nvelocities for an isolated system in a stationary state will always\nassume the Maxwellian form if the number of particles tends to\ninfinity. Notably, this argument completely dispenses with any\nparticular assumption about collisions, or other details of the\nmechanical model involved, apart from the assumption that it is\nHamiltonian. Indeed it need not even represent a gas. \n\nThird, and most importanty, the main weakness of the present result is its\nassumption that the trajectory actually visits all points on the\nenergy hypersurface.  This is what the Ehrenfests called the ergodic\n hypothesis.[8]\n Boltzmann returned to this issue on the final page of the paper\n(WA I, 96). He notes there that exceptions to his\ntheorem might occur, if the microscopic variables would not, in the\ncourse of time, take on all values compatible with the conservation of\nenergy. For example this would be the case when the trajectory is\nperiodic. However, Boltzmann observed, such cases would be immediately\ndestroyed by the slightest disturbance from outside, e.g., by the\ninteraction of a single external atom. He argued that these exceptions\nwould thus only provide cases of unstable equilibrium. \n\nStill, Boltzmann must have felt unsatisfied with his own argument.\nAccording to an editorial footnote in the collection of his scientific\npapers (WA I, 96), Boltzmann's personal copy of the paper contains a\nhand-written remark in the margin stating that the point was still\ndubious and that it had not been proven that, even including\ninteraction with an external atom, the trajectory would traverse all\npoints on the energy hypersurface. \n\nHowever, his doubts were still not laid to rest. His next paper on gas\ntheory (1871a) returns to the study of a detailed mechanical gas\nmodel, this time consisting of polyatomic molecules, and explicitly avoids any\nreliance on the ergodic hypothesis. And when he did return to the\nergodic hypothesis in (1871b), it was with much more caution. Indeed, it is\nhere that he actually first described the worrying assumption as an\nhypothesis, formulated as follows: \n Note that Boltzmann formulates this hypothesis for an arbitrary body,\ni.e., it is not restricted to gases. He also emphasizes, at the end of\nthe paper, that “the proof that this hypothesis is fulfilled for\nthermal bodies, or even is fullfillable, has not been provided” (WA I,\n287).  \n\nThere is a major confusion among modern commentators about the role\nand status of the ergodic hypothesis in Boltzmann's thinking. Indeed,\nthe question has often been raised how Boltzmann could ever have\nbelieved that a trajectory traverses all points on the energy\nhypersurface, since, as the Ehrenfests conjectured in 1911, and was\nshown almost immediately in 1913 by Plancherel and Rozenthal, this is\nmathematically impossible when the energy hypersurface has a dimension\nlarger than 1. \n\nIt is a fact that both (1868) [WA I, 96] and\n(1871b) [WA I, 284] mention external disturbances as an\ningredient in the motivation for the ergodic hypothesis. This might be\ntaken as evidence for ‘interventionalism’, i.e., the\nviewpoint that such external influences are crucial in the explanation\nof thermal phenomena (see Blatt 1959, Ridderbos & Redhead 1998).\nYet even though Boltzmann clearly expressed the thought that these\ndisturbances might help to motivate the ergodic hypothesis, he never\ntook the idea very seriously. The marginal note in the 1868 paper\nmentioned above indicated that, even if the system is disturbed, there\nis still no easy proof of the ergodic hypothesis, and all his further\ninvestigations concerning this hypothesis assume a system that is\neither completely isolated from its environment or at most acted upon\nby a static external force. Thus, interventionalism did not play a\nsignificant role in his\n thinking.[9] \n\nIt has also been suggested, in view of Boltzmann's later habit of\ndiscretising continuous variables, that he somehow thought of the\nenergy hypersurface as a discrete manifold containing only finitely\nmany discrete cells (Gallavotti 1994).  In this reading, obviously,\nthe mathematical no-go theorems of Rozenthal and Plancherel no longer\napply. Now it is definitely true that Boltzmann developed a preference\ntowards discretizing continuous variables, and would later apply this\nprocedure more and more (although usually adding that this was purely\nfor purposes of illustration and more easy understanding). However,\nthere is no evidence in the (1868) and (1871b) papers that Boltzmann\nimplicitly assumed a discrete structure of mechanical phase space or\nthe energy hypersurface. \n\nInstead, the context of his (1871b) makes clear enough how he intended\nthe hypothesis, as has already been argued by (Brush\n1976). Immediately preceding the section in which the hypothesis is\nintroduced, Boltzmann discusses trajectories for a simple example: a\ntwo-dimensional harmonic oscillator with potential \\(V(x,y) = ax^2 +\nby^2\\). For this system, the configuration point \\((x, y)\\) moves\nthrough the surface of a rectangle.  See Figure 1 below. (See also\nCercignani 1998, 148.)\n Figure 1.  \\(\\sqrt{a/b}\\) is\n    rational \\(( = 4/7 )\\).\n  \n He then notes that if \\(a/b\\) is rational, (actually: if\n\\(\\sqrt{a/b}\\) is rational) this motion is periodic. However, if this\nvalue is irrational, the trajectory will, in the course of time,\ntraverse “almählich die ganze Fläche” (WA I,\n271) of the rectangle. See Figure 2: Figure 2.  \\(\\sqrt{a/b}\\) is\n    irrational \\(( = 1/e )\\).\n  \n He says in this case that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are independent,\nsince for each values of \\(x\\) an infinity of values for \\(y\\) in any\ninterval in its range are possible. The very fact that Boltzmann\nconsiders intervals for the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) of arbitrary\nsmall sizes, and stressed the distinction between rational and\nirrational values of the ratio \\(a/b\\), indicates that he\ndid not silently presuppose that phase space was essentially\ndiscrete, where those distinctions would make no sense. \n\nNow clearly, in modern language, one should say in the second case\nthat the trajectory lies densely in the surface, but not that\nit traverses all points. Boltzmann did not possess this language. In\nfact, he could not have been aware of Cantor's insight that the\ncontinuum contains more than a countable infinity of points. Thus, the\ncorrect statement that, in the case that \\(\\sqrt{a/b}\\) is irrational,\nthe trajectory will traverse, for each value of \\(x\\), an infinity of\nvalues of \\(y\\) within any interval however small, could easily have\nlead him to believe (incorrectly) that all values of \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are traversed in the course of time. \n\nIt thus seems eminently plausible, by the fact that this discussion\nimmediately precedes the formulation of the ergodic hypothesis, that\nthe intended reading of the ergodic hypothesis is really what the\nEhrenfests dubbed the quasi-ergodic hypothesis, namely, the\nassumption that the trajectory lies densely (i.e. passes arbitrarily\nclose to every point) on the energy\n hypersurface.[10]\n The quasi-ergodic hypothesis is not mathematically impossible in\nhigher-dimensional phase spaces. However, the quasi-ergodic hypothesis\ndoes not entail the desired conclusion that the only stationary\nprobability distribution over the energy surface is micro-canonical.\nOne might then still conjecture that if the system is quasi-ergodic,\nthe only continuous stationary distribution is microcanonical. But\neven this is fails in general (Nemytskii and Stepanov 1960).  \n\nNevertheless, Boltzmann remained skeptical about the validity of his\nhypothesis. For this reason, he attempted to explore different routes\nto his goal of characterizing thermal equilibrium in mechanics. Indeed,\nboth the preceding (1871a) and his next paper (1871c) present alternative\narguments, with the explicit recommendation that they avoid hypotheses.\nIn fact, he did not return to this hypothesis until the 1880s\n(stimulated by Maxwell's 1879 review of the last section of Boltzmann's\n1868 paper). At that time, perhaps feeling fortified by Maxwell's\nauthority, he would express much more confidence in the ergodic\nhypothesis (see Section 5).  \n\nSo what role did the ergodic hypothesis play? It seems that Boltzmann\nregarded the ergodic hypothesis as a special dynamical assumption that\nmay or may not be true, depending on the nature of the system, and\nperhaps also on its initial state. Its role was simply to help derive\na result of great generality: for any system for which the hypothesis\nis true, its unique equilibrium state is characterized by the\nmicrocanonical distribution (3), from which a form of the Maxwell\ndistribution may be recovered in the limit \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\),\nregardless of any details of the inter-particle interactions, or\nindeed whether the system represented is a gas, fluid, solid or any\nother thermal body.  Note also that the microcanonical distribution\nimmediately implies that the probability of finding the system in any\nregion on the energy hypersurface is proportional to the size of that\nregion (as measured by the microcanonical measure). This idea would\nresurface in his 1877 combinatorial argument, although then without\nthe context of characterizing equilibrium thermal equilibrium. \n\nThe Ehrenfests have suggested that the ergodic hypothesis played a\nmuch more fundamental role. In particular they have pointed out that if\nthe hypothesis is true, averaging over an (infinitely) long time would\nbe identical to phase averaging with the microcanonical distribution.\nThus, they suggested that Boltzmann relied on the ergodic hypothesis in\norder to equate time averages and phase averages, or in other words, to\nequate two meaning of probability (relative time and relative volume in\nphase space.) There is however no evidence that Boltzmann ever followed\nthis line of reasoning. He simply never gave any justification for\nequivocating time and particle averages, or phase averages, at all.\nPresumably, he thought nothing much depended on this issue and that it\nwas a matter of taste. \n\nIn 1872 Boltzmann published one of his most important papers, its long\ntitle often abbreviated as Weitere Studien (Further\nstudies). It was aimed at a something completely new, namely at\nshowing that whatever the initial state of a gas system was, it would\nalways tend to evolve to equilibrium.  Thus, this paper is the first\nwork to deal with non-equilibrium theory.  The paper contained two\ncelebrated results nowadays known as the Boltzmann equation and the\nH-theorem. The latter result was the basis of Boltzmann's\nrenewed claim to have obtained a general theorem corresponding to the\nsecond law. This paper has been studied and commented upon by numerous\nauthors. Indeed an integral translation of the text has been provided\nby (Brush 1966).  Thus, for the present purposes, a succinct summary\nof the main points might have been sufficient. However, there is still\ndispute among modern commentators about its actual content. \n\nThe issue at stake is the question whether the results obtained in\nthis paper are presented as necessary consequences of the mechanical\nequations of motion, or whether Boltzmann explicitly acknowledged that\nthey would allow for exceptions. Klein has written \n Klein argues that Boltzmann only came to acknowledge the existence of\nsuch exceptions thanks to Loschmidt's critique in 1877. An opposite\nopinion is expressed by von Plato (1994).  He argues that, already in\n1872, Boltzmann was well aware that his H-theorem had\nexceptions, and thus “already had a full hand against his future\ncritics”. Indeed, von Plato states that \n It might be of some interest to try and settle this dispute.  \n The Weitere Studien starts with an\nappraisal of the role of probability theory in the context of gas\ntheory. The number of particles in a gas is so enormous, and their\nmovements are so swift that we can observe nothing but average values.\nThe determination of averages is the province of probability calculus.\nTherefore, “the problems of the mechanical theory of heat are really\nproblems in probability calculus” (WA I, 317). But, Boltzmann says, it\nwould be a mistake to believe that the theory of heat would therefore\ncontain uncertainties. \n\nHe emphasizes that one should not confuse incompletely proven\nassertions with rigorously derived theorems of probability theory. The\nlatter are necessary consequences from their premisses, as in any other\ntheory. They will be confirmed by experience as soon as one has\nobserved a sufficiently large number of cases. This last condition,\nhowever, should be no significant problem in the theory of heat because\nof the enormous number of molecules in macroscopic bodies. Yet, in this\ncontext, one has to make doubly sure that we proceed with the utmost\nrigor. \n\nThus, the message expressed in the opening pages of this paper seems\nclear enough: the results Boltzmann is about to derive are advertised\nas doubly checked and utterly rigorous. Of course, their relationship\nwith experience might be less secure, since any probability statement\nis only reproduced in observations by sufficiently large numbers of\nindependent data. Thus, Boltzmann would have allowed for exceptions in\nthe relationship between theory and observation, but not in the\nrelation between premisses and conclusion. \n\nHe continues by saying what he means by probability, and repeats its\nequivocation as a fraction of time and the relative number of particles\nthat we have seen earlier in 1868a: \n This equivocation is not vicious however. For most of the paper the\nintended meaning of probability is always the relative number of\nmolecules with a particular molecular state. Only at the final stages\nof his paper (WA I, 400) does the time-average interpretation of\nprobability (suddenly) recur. \n\nBoltzmann says that both he and Maxwell had attempted the\ndetermination of these probabilities for a gas system but without\nreaching a complete solution. Yet, on a closer inspection, “it seems\nnot so unlikely that these probabilities can be derived on the basis\nof the equations of motion alone…” (WA I, 317). Indeed, he\nannounces, he has solved this problem for gases whose molecules\nconsist of an arbitrary number of atoms. His aim is to prove that\nwhatever the initial state in such a system of gas molecules, it must\ninevitably approach the state characterized by the Maxwell\ndistribution (WA I, 320). \n\nThe next section specializes to the simplest case of monatomic gases\nand also provides a more complete specification of the problem he aims\nto solve. The gas molecules are modelled as hard spheres, contained in\na fixed vessel with perfectly elastic walls (WA I, 320). Boltzmann\nrepresents the state of the gas by a time-dependent distribution\nfunction \\(f_t(\\vec{v})\\) which gives us, at each time \\(t\\), the\nrelative number of molecules with velocity\n\\(\\vec{v}\\).[11]\nHe also states three more special assumptions: \n After a few well-known manipulations, the result from these\nassumptions is a differentio-integral equation (the Boltzmann\nequation) that determines the evolution of the distribution function\n\\(f_t(v)\\) from any given initial form.  \n\nThere are also a few unstated assumptions that go into the derivation\nof this equation. First, the number of molecules must be large enough\nso that the (discrete) distribution of their velocities can be well\napproximated by a continuous and differentiable function\n\\(f\\). Secondly, \\(f\\) changes under the effect of binary collisions\nonly. This means that the density of the gas should be low (so that\nthree-particle collisions can be ignored) but not too low (so that\ncollisions would be too infrequent to change \\(f\\) at all. (The modern\nprocedure to put these requirements in a mathematically precise form\nis that of taking the so-called Boltzmann-Grad limit.) A final\ningredient is that all the above assumptions are not only valid at an\ninstant but remain true in the course of time. \nThe H-theorem. Assuming that the Boltzmann\nequation is valid for all times, one can prove without difficulty the\n“H-theorem”: the quantity \\(H\\) (that Boltzmann\nin this paper actually denotes as \\(E\\)), defined as  \n\ndecreases monotonically in time, i.e., \n\nas well as its stationarity for the Maxwell distribution, i.e.,  \n\nBoltzmann concludes this section of the paper as follows: It has thus been rigorously proved that whatever may have been the\ninitial distribution of kinetic energy, in the course of time it must\nnecessarily approach the form found by Maxwell. […] This\n[proof] actually gains much in significance because of its\napplicability on the theory of multi-atomic gas molecules. There too,\none can prove for a certain quantity \\(E\\) that, because of the\nmolecular motion, this quantity can only decrease or in the limiting\ncase remain constant. Thus, one may prove that, because of the atomic\nmovement in systems consisting of arbitrarily many material points,\nthere always exists a quantity which, due to these atomic movements,\ncannot increase, and this quantity agrees, up to a constant factor,\nexactly with the value that I found in [Boltzmann 1871c] for the\nwell-known integral \\(\\int dQ/T\\). This provides an analytical proof of the Second Law in a way\ncompletely different from those attempted so far. Up till now, one has\nattempted to proof that \\(\\int dQ/T = 0\\) for reversible\n(umkehrbaren) cyclic[12] processes, which however does not prove\nthat for an irreversible cyclic process, which is the only one\nnote-that occurs in nature, it is always negative; the reversible\nprocess being merely an idealization, which can be approached more or\nless but never perfectly. Here, however, we immediately reach the\nresult that \\(\\int dQ/T\\) is in general negative and zero only in a\nlimit case… (WA I, 345) \n\nThus, as in his 1866 paper, Boltzmann claims to have a rigorous,\nanalytical and general proof of the Second Law. \n1. As we have seen, The H-theorem formed the basis of a\nrenewed claim by Boltzmann to have obtained a theorem corresponding to\nthe second law, at least for gases. A main difference with his\nprevious (1866) claim, is that he now strongly emphasized the role of\nprobability calculus in his derivation. Even so, it will be noted that\nhis conception of probability is still a fully mechanical one. Thus,\nthere is no conflict between his claims that on the one hand,\n“the problems of the mechanical theory of heat are really\nproblems in probability calculus” and that the probabilities\nthemselves are “derived on the basis of the equations of motion\nalone”, on the other hand. Indeed, it seems to me that\nBoltzmann's emphasis on the crucial role of probability is only\nintended to convey that probability theory provides a particularly\nuseful and appropriate language for discussing mechanical problems in\ngas theory. There is no indication in this paper yet that probability\ntheory could play a role by furnishing assumptions of a non-mechanical\nnature, i.e., independent of the equations of motion. However, see\nBadino (2006, Other Internet Resources) for a very different point of\nview.  \n\n2. Note that Boltzmann stresses the generality, rigor and\n“analyticity” of his proof. He put no emphasis on the special\nassumptions that go into the argument. Indeed,\nthe, Stoßzahlansatz commonly identified as the key\nassumption that is responsible for the time-asymmetry of the\nH-theorem, is announced as follows: This, is not an announcement that would alert his readers to the\ncrucial role of this assumption. \nStill, it thus seems natural that Boltzmann's contemporaries must have\nunderstood him as claiming that the H-theorem followed\nnecessarily from the dynamics of the mechanical gas model. Indeed this\nis exactly how Boltzmann's claims were understood.  For example, the\nrecommendation written in 1888 for his membership of the Prussian\nAcademy of Sciences mentions as Boltzmann's main feat that had proven\nthat, whatever its initial state, a gas must necessarily approach the\nMaxwellian distribution (Kirsten and Körber 1975, 109).  \nIs there then no evidence at all for von Plato's reading of the\npaper? Von Plato quotes a passage from Section II, where Boltzmann\nrepeats the previous analysis by assuming that energy can take on only\ndiscrete values, and replacing all integrals by sums. He recovers, of\ncourse, the same conclusion, but now adds a side remark, which touches\nupon the case of non-uniform gases: \n True enough, Boltzmann in the above quote indicates that there are\nexceptions. But he mentions them only in connection with an\nextension of his results to the case when the gas is not\ninitially uniform, i.e., when condition (b) above is dropped.  There\ncan be no doubt that under the assumption of the conditions\n(a – c), Boltzmann claimed rigorous validity of the\nH-theorem. \n\n3. Note that Boltzmann misconstrues, or perhaps understates, the\nsignificance of his results. Both the Boltzmann equation and the\nH theorem refer to a body of gas in a fixed container that\nevolves in complete isolation from its environment. There is no\nquestion of heat being exchanged by the gas during a process, let\nalone in an irreversible cyclic process. His comparison with Clausius'\nintegral \\(\\int dQ/T\\) (i.e., \\(\\oint \\dbar Q/T\\) in modern notation)\nis therefore really completely out of place. \n\nThe true import of Boltzmann's results is rather that they provide a\ngeneralization of the entropy concept to non-equilibrium states, and a\nclaim that this non-equilibrium entropy \\(-kH\\) increases\nmonotonically as the isolated gas evolves from non-equilibrium towards\nan equilibrium state. The relationship with the second law is,\ntherefore, indirect. On the one hand, Boltzmann proves much more than\nwas required, since the second law does not speak of non-equilibrium\nentropy, nor of monotonic increase; on the other hand it proves also\nless, since Boltzmann does not consider more general adiabatic\nprocesses. \n\nAccording to Klein (1973)  Boltzmann seemed to have\nbeen satisfied with his treatments of 1871 and 1872 and turned his\nattention to other matters for a couple of years. He did come back to\ngas theory in 1875 to discuss an extension of the Boltzmann equation to\ngases subjected to external forces. But this paper does not present any\nfundamental changes of thought. However, the 1875 paper did contain a\nresult which, two years later, led to a debate with Loschmidt. It\nshowed that a gas in equilibrium in an external force field (such as\nthe earth's gravity) should have a uniform temperature, and therefore,\nthe same average kinetic energy at all heights. This conclusion\nconflicted with the intuition that rising molecules must do work\nagainst the gravitational field, and pay for this by having a lower\nkinetic energy at greater heights. \n\nNow Boltzmann (1875) was not the first to reach the contrary result,\nand Loschmidt was not the first to challenge it. Maxwell and Guthrie\nentered into a debate on the very same topic in 1873. But actually\ntheir main point of contention need not concern us very much. The\ndiscussion between Loschmidt and Boltzmann is important for quite\nanother issue which Loschmidt only introduced as a side remark: By the way, one should be careful about the claim that in\na system in which the so-called stationary state has been achieved,\nstarting from an arbitrary initial state, this average state can remain\nintact for all times. […]  Indeed, if in the above case [i.e. starting in a state where one\nparticle is moving, and all the others lie still on the bottom], after\na time τ which is long enough to obtain the stationary state, one\nsuddenly assumes that the velocities of all atoms are reversed, we\nwould obtain an initial state that would appear to have the same\ncharacter as the stationary state. For a fairly long time this would\nbe appropriate, but gradually the stationary state would deteriorate,\nand after passage of the time τ we would inevitable return to our\noriginal state: only one atom has absorbed all kinetic energy of the\nsystem […], while all other molecules lie still on the bottom of the\ncontainer. Obviously, in every arbitrary system the course of events\nmust be become retrograde when the velocities of all its elements are\nreversed.  (Loschmidt 1876, 139) \n\nPutting the point in more modern terms, the laws of (Hamiltonian)\nmechanics are such that for every solution one can construct another\nsolution by reversing all velocities and replacing \\(t\\) by\n\\(-t\\). Since \\(H[f]\\) is invariant under the velocity reversal, it\nfollows that if \\(H[f]\\) decreases for the first solution, it will\nincrease for the second. Accordingly, the reversibility objection is\nthat the H-theorem cannot be a general theorem for all\nmechanical evolutions of the gas. \n Boltzmann's response (1877a).  Boltzmann's responses\nto the reversibility objection are not easy to make sense of, and\nvaried in the course of time. In his immediate response to Loschmidt\nhe acknowledges that certain initial states of the gas would lead to\nan increase of the \\(H\\) function, and hence a violation of the\nH-theorem. The crux of his rebuttal was that such initial\nstates were extremely improbable, and could hence safely be\nignored. \n\nThis argument shows that Boltzmann was already implicitly embarking\non an approach that differed from the context of the 1872 paper. Recall\nthat this paper used the concept of probability only in the guise of a\ndistribution function, giving the probability of molecular velocities.\nThere was no such thing in that paper as the probability of a state of\nthe gas as whole. This conceptual shift would become more explicit in\nBoltzmann's next paper (1877b). \n\nThis rebuttal of Loschmidt is far from satisfactory. Any reasonable\nprobability assignment to gas states is presumably invariant under the\nvelocity reversal of the molecules. If an initial state leading to an\nincrease of \\(H\\) is to be ignored on account of its small\nprobability, one ought to assume the same for the state from which it\nwas constructed by velocity reversal. In other words, any\nnon-equilibrium state would have to be ignored. But that in effect\nsaves the H-theorem by restricting it to those cases where it\nis trivially true, i.e., where \\(H\\) is constant. \n\nThe true source of the reversibility problem was only identified by\nBurbury (1894a) and Bryan1 (1894), by pointing out that already the\nStoßzahlansatz contained a time-asymmetric\nassumption. Indeed, if we replace the SZA by the assumption that the\nnumber of collisions is proportional to the product \\(f(\\vec{v}'_1)\nf(\\vec{v}'_2)\\) for the velocities \\(\\vec{v}'_1, \\vec{v}'_2\\) after\nthe collision, we would obtain, by a similar reasoning, \\(dH/dt \\le\n0\\).  The question is now, of course, we would prefer one assumption\nabove the other, without falling into some kind of double\nstandards. One thing is certain, and that is that any such preference\ncannot be obtained from mechanics and probability theory alone. \n\nBoltzmann’s begins the paper by stating that his goal is to\nelucidate the relationship between the Second Law and probability\ncalculus. He notes he has repeatedly emphasized that the Second Law is\nrelated to probability calculus. In particular he points out that the\n1872 paper confirmed this relationship by showing that a certain\nquantity [i.e. \\(H\\)] can only decrease, and must therefore obtain its\nminimum value in the state of thermal equilibrium. Yet, this\nconnection of the Second Law with probability theory became even more\napparent in his previous paper (1877a). Boltzmann states that he will\nnow solve the problem mentioned in that paper, of calculating the\nprobabilities of various distributions of state by determining the\nratio of their numbers. \nHe also announces that, when a system starts in an improbable state,\nit will always evolve towards more probable states, until it reaches\nthe most probable state, i.e. that of thermal equilibrium. When this\nis applied to the Second Law, he says, “we can identify that quantity\nwhich is usually called entropy, with the probability of the state in\nquestion.” And: “According to the present interpretation, [the Second\nLaw] states nothing else but that the probability of the total state\nof a composite system always increases” [W.A. II, pp. 165–6]. Exactly\nhow all this is meant, he says, will become clear later in the\narticle. \nSuccinctly, and rephrased in modern terms, the argument is as\nfollows. Apart from \\(\\Gamma\\), the mechanical phase space containing\nthe possible states x for the total gas system, we consider\nthe so-called \\(\\mu\\)-space, i.e., the state space of a single\nmolecule. For monatomic gases, this space is just a six-dimensional\nspace with \\((\\vec{p}, \\vec{q})\\) as coordinates. With each state\n\\(x\\) is associated a collection of \\(N\\) points in \\(\\mu\\)-space. \n\nWe now partition \\(\\mu\\) into \\(m\\) disjoint cells: \\(\\mu = \\omega_1\n\\cup \\ldots \\cup \\omega_m\\). These\n\ncells are taken to be rectangular in the position and momentum\ncoordinates and of equal size.  Further, it is assumed we can\ncharacterize each cell in \\(\\mu\\) with a molecular energy\n\\(\\epsilon_i\\). \n\nFor each \\(x\\), henceforth also called the microstate, we define\nthe macrostate (Boltzmann's term was Komplexion) as\n\\(Z := (n_1,\\ldots,n_m)\\), where \\(n_i\\) is the number of particles\nthat have their molecular state in cell \\(\\omega_i\\). The relation\nbetween macro- and microstate is obviously non-unique since many\ndifferent microstates, e.g., obtained by permuting the molecules, lead\nto the same macrostate.  One may associate with every given macrostate\n\\(Z_0\\) the corresponding set of microstates: \n The volume \\(\\lvert A_{Z_0} \\rvert\\) of this set is proportional to\nthe number of permutations that lead to this macrostate. Boltzmann\nproposes the problem to determine for which macrostate \\(Z\\) the\nvolume \\(\\lvert A_Z \\rvert\\) is maximal, under the constraints of a\ngiven total number of particles, and a given total energy: \n This problem can easily be solved with the Lagrange multiplier\ntechnique. Under the Stirling approximation for \\(n_i \\gg 1\\) we\nfind which is a discrete version of the Maxwell distribution.  \n\nMoreover, the volume of the corresponding set in \\(\\Gamma\\) is related\nto a discrete approximation of the H-function.  Indeed, one\nfinds  \n In other words, if we take \\(-kNH\\) as the entropy of a macrostate,\nit is also proportional to the logarithm of the volume of the\ncorresponding region in phase space. \n\nBoltzmann also refers to these volumes as the “probability” of the\nmacrostate. He therefore now expresses the second law as a tendency to\nevolve towards ever more probable macrostates. \n\n1. No dynamical assumption is made; i.e., it is not relevant to the\nargument whether or how the particles collide. It might seem that this\nmakes the present argument more general than the previous one. Indeed,\nBoltzmann suggests at the end of the paper that the same argument might\nbe applicable also to dense gases and even to solids.  \n\nHowever, it should be noticed that the assumption that the total\nenergy can be expressed in the form \\(E = \\sum_i n_i\\epsilon_i\\) means\nthat the energy of each particle depends only on the cell in which it\nis located, and not the state of other particles. This can only be\nmaintained, independently of the number \\(N\\), if there is no\ninteraction at all between the particles. The validity of the argument\nis thus really restricted to ideal gases. \n\n2. The procedure of dividing \\(\\mu\\) space into cells is essential\nhere. Indeed, the whole prospect of using combinatorics would\ndisappear if we did not adopt a partition. But the choice to take all\ncells equal in size in position and momentum variables is not quite\nself-evident, as Boltzmann himself shows. In fact, before he develops\nthe argument above, his paper first discusses an analysis in which the\nparticles are characterized by their energy instead of position and\nmomentum. This leads him to carve up \\(\\mu\\)-space into cells of equal\nsize in energy. He then shows that this analysis fails to reproduce\nthe desired Maxwell distribution as the most probable state. This\nfailure is remedied by taking equally sized cells in position and\nmomentum variables. The latter choice is apparently\n‘right’, in the sense that leads to the desired\nresult. However, since the choice clearly cannot be relegated to a\nmatter of convention, it leaves the question for a justification. \n\n3. A crucial new ingredient in the argument is the distinction between\nmicro- and macrostates. Note in particular that where in the previous\nwork the distribution function \\(f\\) was identified with a probability\n(namely of a molecular state), in the present paper it, or its\ndiscrete analogy \\(Z\\) is a description of the macrostate of the\ngas. Probabilities are not assigned to the particles, but to the\nmacrostate of the gas as a whole. According to Klein (1973, 84), this\nconceptual transition in 1877b marks the birth of statistical\nmechanics. While this view is not completely correct (as we have seen,\nBoltzmann 1868 already applied probability to the total gas), it is\ntrue that (1877b) is the first occasion where Boltzmann identifies\nprobability of a gas state with relative volume in phase space, rather\nthan its relative time of duration. \n\nAnother novelty is that Boltzmann has changed his concept of\nequilibrium. Whereas previously the essential characteristic of an\nequilibrium state was always that it is stationary, in Boltzmann's new\nview it is conceived as the macrostate (i.e., a region in phase space)\nthat can be realized in the largest number of ways. As a result, an\nequilibrium state need not be stationary: in the course of time, the\nsystem may fluctuate in and out of equilibrium. 4. But what about evolutions? Perhaps the most important\nissue is the question what exactly the relation is of the 1877b paper\nto Loschmidt’s objection and Boltzmann’s p reply to it (1877a)? The\nprimary reply can be read as an announcement of two subjects of\nfurther investigation: \nThis is a problem about equilibrium. The second announcement was that\nBoltzmann said:  Because there are so very many more uniform than non-uniform\ndistributions, it should be extraordinarily improbable that a system\nshould evolve from a uniform distribution of states to a non-uniform\ndistribution of states. This is a problem about evolution. In other\nwords, one would like to see that something like the statistical\nH-theorem actually holds.  Boltzmann’s (1877b) is widely read as a\nfollow-up to these announcements. Indeed, Boltzmann repeats the first\nquote above in the introduction of the paper (W.A. II, p. 165),\nindicating that he will address this problem. And so he does,\nextensively. Yet he also states: \nThus, the main goal of 1877b is apparently to address the problem\nconcerning evolutions and to show how they relate to the Second\nLaw. Indeed, this is what one would naturally expect since the\nreversibility objection is, after all, a problem concerned with\nevolutions. Even so, a remarkable fact is that the 1877b paper hardly\never touches its self-professed “main goal” at all.  For a sketch of\nhow different commentators on Boltzmann's (1877b) view his attitude on\nthis question I refer to Uffink (2007).  To sum up this discussion of Boltzmann’s answer to the\nreversibility objection: it seems that on all above readings of his\ntwo 1877 papers, the lacuna between what Boltzmann had achieved and\nwhat he needed to do to answer Loschmidt satisfactorily –\ni.e. to address the issue of the evolution of distributions of state\nand to prove that non-uniform distributions tend, in some statistical\nsense, to uniform ones, or to prove any other reformulation of the\nH-theorem – remains striking. \n\nAs we have seen, the 1877 papers introduced some conceptual shifts in\nBoltzmann’ approach. Accordingly, this year is frequently seen as a\nwatershed in Boltzmann's thinking. Concurrent with that view, one would\nexpect his subsequent work to build on his new insights and turn away\nfrom the themes and assumptions of his earlier papers. Actually,\nBoltzmann's subsequent work in gas theory in the next decade and a half\nwas predominantly concerned with technical applications of his 1872\nBoltzmann equation, in particular to gas diffusion and gas friction.\nAnd when he did touch on fundamental aspects of the theory, he returned\nto the issues and themes raised in his 1868–1871 papers, in particular\nthe ergodic hypothesis and the use of ensembles.  \n\nThis step was again triggered by a paper of Maxwell, this time one\nthat must have pleased Boltzmann very much, since it was called “On\nBoltzmann's theorem” (Maxwell 1879) and dealt with the theorem\ndiscussed in the last section of his (1868). He pointed out that this\ntheorem does not rely on any collision assumption. But Maxwell also\nmade some pertinent observations along the way. He is critical about\nBoltzmann's ergodic hypothesis, pointing out that “it is manifest that\nthere are cases in which this does not take place” (Maxwell 1879,\n694). Apparently, Maxwell had not noticed that Boltzmann's later\npapers had also expressed similar doubts. He rejected Boltzmann'a\ntime-average view of probability and instead preferred to interpret\nρ as an ensemble density. Further, he states that any claim that\nthe distribution function obtained was the unique stationary\ndistribution “remained to be investigated” (Maxwell 1879,\n722). Maxwell's paper seems to have revived Boltzmann's interest in\nthe ergodic hypothesis, which he had been avoiding for a decade. This\nrenewed confidence is expressed, for example in Boltzmann\n(1887): \n However, he does not return to this conviction in later work. His\nLectures on Gas Theory (1896,1898), for example, does not\neven mention the ergodic hypothesis. \n\nThe first occasion on which Boltzmann returned to the reversibility\nobjection is in (1887b). This paper delves into a discussion between\nTait and Burbury about the approach to equilibrium for a system\nconsisting of gas particles of two different kinds. The details of the\ndebate need not concern us, except to note that Tait raised the\nreversibility objection to show that taking any evolution approaching\nequilibrium one may construct, by reversal of the velocities, another\nevolution moving away from equilibrium. At this point Boltzmann\nentered the discussion: \n This reply to the reversibility objection uses an entirely different\nstrategy from his (1877a). Here, Boltzmann does not exclude the\nreversed motions on account of their vanishing probability, but rather\nargues that, sooner or later, they too will reach the equilibrium\nstate.  \n\nNote how much Boltzmann's strategy has shifted: whereas previously the\nidea was that a gas system should approach equilibrium because of the\nH-theorem; Boltzmann's idea is now, apparently, that\nregardless of the behavior of \\(H\\) as a function of time,\nthere are independent reasons for assuming that the system approaches\nequilibrium. Boltzmann's contentions may of course very well be true.\nBut they do not follow from the H-theorem, or by ignoring its\nexceptions, and would have to be proven otherwise. \n\nThe 1890s brought three major events in Boltzmann's work on\nstatistical physics. The foremost of these was his participation in\nthe 1894 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of\nScience (BAAS) in Oxford, where issues in gas theory were lively\ndebated.  Another was his debate with Zermelo, in 1896–1897. The\nthird was the appearance of his two-volume book Lectures in Gas\nTheory in 1896 and 1898.  for a more extensive discussion of the\nDebate with Zermelo, see Uffink (2007) and (2013).   \n\nThe BAAS meeting had a lively aftermath: A discussion between half a\ndozen authors in the columns of Nature in the years\n1894–1895. The central topic of this debate was the paradoxical\nrelation between the H-theorem and the reversibility\nobjection. \n\nThe kick-off was an letter by Culverwell (1894) with the\ninnocently-sounding question, “Will anyone say exactly what the\nH-theorem proves?” The question triggered several responses.\nCulverwell noted, with some amusement, in a subsequent letter\n(1895)  that they all seemed to argue quite\ndifferently. Perhaps the most important responses were Burbury (1894a)\nand (1894b) and Bryan (1894). Burbury argued that the\nH-theorem rests on an additional assumption, which was\nindependent of mechanical theory, which he coined “Condition A”. His\nactual phrasing of the condition was somewhat involved. In any case,\nBurbury, argued out that the reversed motion would not satisfy\nCondition A, and that the H-theorem would thus fail to be\napplicable. He thus succeeded in finally illuminating the logical\nsituation between the reversibility objection and the\nH-theorem. The theorem assumed the validity of a condition,\nwhich would be violated in the reversed motion; i.e., Condition A\nitself already contained a time-asymmetrical element. Further, given\nthe time-reversal invariance of the mechanical laws governing the\nsystem, any motivation for the condition would have to come from\nbeyond these laws and must thus be non-mechanical. \n\nAlthough Burbury had thus succeeded in clarifying the logic of the\nH-theorem, his actual formulation of Condition A was not\nparticularly transparent. By contrast, Bryan's contribution to the\ndebate may be said to possess the opposite qualities. He was the first\nto clearly point out that the SZA itself is not invariant under\ntime-reversal. Less convincing is his argument that the time-reversed\nassumption would suppose the molecules possessing some kind of\nforesight. \n\nFinally Boltzmann himself intervened in the debate (Boltzmann 1895).\nHe recognized, of course, that the same issues that he discussed with\nLoschmidt 20 years earlier were again at stake, and elucidated: \n  My minimum theorem as well as the so-called Second Law of Thermodynamics\nare only theorems of probability (WA III, 539). It can never be proved from the equations of motion alone, that\nthe minimum function \\(H\\) must always decrease. It can only be\ndeduced from the laws of probability, that if the initial state is not\nspecially arranged for a certain purpose, but haphazard governs\nfreely, the probability that \\(H\\) decreases is always greater than\nthat it increases. (WA III, 540) \n\nIn more detail, his argument is as follows. Consider a gas in a vessel\nwith perfectly smooth and elastic walls, in an arbitrary initial state\nand let it evolve in the course of time. At each time \\(t\\) we can\ncalculate \\(H(t)\\). Now draw a graph of this function: the\n\\(H\\)-curve. (In a later discussion, Boltzmann 1897, he actually\nproduced a diagram.) \n\nBarring all cases in which the motion is ‘regular’, e.g.,\nwhen all the molecules move in one plane, Boltzmann claims the\nfollowing properties of the curve: \n\nSuppose that, at some time \\(t=0\\), the function attain a certain\nvalue \\(H_0\\), well above the minimum value. Now, Boltzmann says,\ntwo[13] cases\nare possible for the evolution of \\(H\\) in time. (a) \\(H_0\\) lies at\nor near the top of a peak. Then \\(H(t)\\) will decrease, whether we\nmove away in either the positive are negative time direction. (b)\n\\(H_0\\) lies on an ascending or descending part of the curve, so that\n\\(H(t)\\) decreases or increases. But, because of (iii), case (a) is\nmuch more probable than case (b). Hence, Boltzmann says,   And,  Together, the claims (i)–(iii) constitute a statement of\nwhat I called a ‘statistical H-theorem’. \n\nAfter having thus elucidated the content of his theorem, Boltzmann\naddressed the reversibility objection. Suppose the gas is initially in\na non-equilibrium state, with a large value of \\(H\\). Then it is\nprobable, but not certain, that it will decrease, and eventually reach\nits minimum \n\nIt is not immediately clear how this refutes the reversibility\nobjection. If we focus on the fact that the reversed state is\n“exceptional”, and take it to belong to those cases\n(“regular motions”) that were explicitly barred in the\nstatement of the theorem, then his reply is like that to\nLoschmidt. But perhaps his central idea here is rather that in the\nreversed motion, \\(H\\) increases for a short while, but will\neventually decrease again, and continue to do so. In that case his\ndefence is more like the reply to Tait. In actual fact the two are\nhard to combine. If we admit that the reversed state is exceptional in\nthe sense that the statistical H-theorem does not hold for\nit, we have no grounds for claiming that eventually \\(H\\) will\ndecrease again. \n\nThis particular article is often cited as one of the clearest\nexpositions that Boltzmann ever wrote, and one in which “he is right\non the money” (Lebowitz 1999). Still there are a few thing that\ndeserve attention. \n\n1. It seems to me that Boltzmann here adopts an (implicit)\nidentification of probability and relative duration, At the very\nleast, he does not indicate any difference in meaning between phrases\nlike “During the greater part of that time, \\(H\\) will be very\nnear to its minimum” and “It is extremely probable that\n\\(H\\) lies near its minimum”. Also, it seems that to me that his\nclaim (ii) that peaks in the curve are “very rare”, and\nhis claim (iii) that they are “very improbable” are\nintended as synonymous. This way of reading Boltzmann would indeed not\nfall out of tune with his previous interpretations of probability. \n\n2. But a larger problem looms. Boltzmann says that the statistical\nH-theorem is something he had “proved in his papers”. But\nthat is surely a gross overstatement. No proof of the claims\n(i)–(iii) for a gas system is to be found anywhere in his work. \n\nThe most well-known view to the problem of how to explain this lacuna\nis, again, supplied by the Ehrenfests. In essence, they suggest that\nBoltzmann somehow silently relied on the ergodic hypothesis. \n\nIt is indeed evident that if the ergodic hypothesis holds, a state\nwill spend time in the various regions of phase space in proportion to\ntheir volume. That is to say, during the evolution of the system along\nits trajectory, regions with a small volume, are visited only\nsporadically, and regions with larger volume more often. \n\nThis would make it plausible how Boltzmann could identify\nprobabilities with relative times. But also, it would make it\nplausible that if a system starts out from a very small region (an\nimprobable state) it will display a ‘tendency’ to evolve\ntowards the overwhelmingly larger equilibrium state. Of course, this\n‘tendency’ would have to be interpreted in a qualified\nsense: the same ergodic hypothesis would imply that the system cannot\nstay inside the equilibrium state forever and thus there would indeed\nbe incessant fluctuations in and out of equilibrium. Indeed, one would\nhave to state that the tendency to evolve from improbable to probable\nstates is itself a probabilistic affair: as something that holds true\nfor most of the initial states, or for most of the time, or as some\ntype of expectation value or another. In short, we would then\nhopefully obtain some statistical version of the\nH-theorem. Exactly how this statistical H-theorem\nshould be formulated remains an open problem in the Ehrenfests' point\nof view. Indeed they distinguish between several possible statistical\ninterpretations of the theorem. \n\nThe Ehrenfests' reading of Boltzmann's intentions has thus some\nundeniable advantages. However, there is no evidence that Boltzmann\nreally had the ergodic hypothesis in mind. It seems m more likely that\nhe relied on a naive identification of the various meanings of\nprobability. Further, nobody has ever succeeded in proving a\nstatistical H-theorem on the basis of the ergodic hypothesis,\nor on the basis of a modern relative such as the hypothesis of\n‘metrical transitivity’. Much stronger dynamical and\nprobabilistic conditions seem to be needed for such a proof, and even\nthen it remains a difficult problem whether these are satisfied in a\nrealistic gas model.","contact.mail":"jbuffink@umn.edu","contact.domain":"umn.edu"}]
