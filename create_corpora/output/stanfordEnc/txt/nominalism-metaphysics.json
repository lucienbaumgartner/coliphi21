In one of them it is the\nrejection of abstract objects; in the other it is the rejection of\nuniversals. Philosophers have often found it necessary to postulate\neither abstract objects or universals. And so Nominalism in one form or\nanother has played a significant role in the metaphysical debate since\nat least the Middle Ages, when versions of the second variety of\nNominalism were introduced. The two varieties of Nominalism are\nindependent from each other and either can be consistently held without\nthe other. However, both varieties share some common motivations and\narguments. This entry surveys nominalistic theories of both\nvarieties.\n\n\n\nThe word ‘Nominalism’, as used by contemporary\nphilosophers in the Anglo-American tradition, is ambiguous. In one\nsense, its most traditional sense deriving from the Middle Ages, it\nimplies the rejection of universals. In another, more modern\nbut equally entrenched sense, it implies the rejection of abstract\nobjects. To say that these are distinct senses of the word\npresupposes that universal and abstract object do not\nmean the same thing. And in fact they do not. For although different\nphilosophers mean different things by universal, and likewise\nby abstract object, according to widespread usage a universal\nis something that can be instantiated by different entities and an\nabstract object is something that is neither spatial nor temporal. \n\nThus there are (at least) two kinds of Nominalism, one that\nmaintains that there are no universals and one that maintains that\nthere are no abstract\n objects.[1]\nRealism about universals is the doctrine that\nthere are universals, and Platonism is the doctrine that there are\nabstract objects. \n\nBut Nominalism is not simply the rejection of universals or abstract\nobjects. For if that were the case, a nihilist, someone who believed\nthat there are no entities at all, would count as a nominalist.\nSimilarly, someone who rejected universals or abstract objects but were\nagnostic about the existence of particulars or concrete objects would\ncount as a nominalist. Given how the term ‘Nominalism’ is\nused in contemporary philosophy, such philosophers would not be\nnominalists. The word ‘Nominalism’ carries an implication\nthat the corresponding doctrine asserts that everything is particular\nor concrete, and that this is not vacuously true. \n\nThus one kind of Nominalism asserts that there are particular\nobjects and that everything is particular, and the other asserts that\nthere are concrete objects and that everything is concrete. \n\nAs noted above, the two forms of nominalism are independent. The\npossibility of being a nominalist in one sense but not in the other has\nbeen exemplified in the history of philosophy. For instance, David\nArmstrong (1978; 1997) is a believer in universals, and so he is not a\nnominalist in the sense of rejecting universals, but he believes that\neverything that exists is spatiotemporal, and so he is a\nnominalist in the sense of rejecting abstract objects. And there are\nthose who, like Quine at a certain point of his philosophical\ndevelopment (1964; 1981), accept sets or classes and so are not\nnominalists in the sense of rejecting abstract objects and yet reject\nuniversals and so are nominalists in the sense of rejecting\nuniversals. \n\nThus Nominalism, in both senses, is a kind of anti-realism. For one\nkind of Nominalism denies the existence, and therefore the reality, of\nuniversals and the other denies the existence, and therefore the\nreality, of abstract objects. But what does Nominalism claim with\nrespect to the entities alleged by some to be universals or abstract\nobjects, e.g. properties, numbers, propositions, possible worlds? Here\nthere are two general options: (a) to deny the existence of the alleged\nentities in question, and (b) to accept the existence of these entities\nbut to argue that they are particular or concrete. \n\nSometimes Nominalism is identified with those positions exemplifying\nstrategy (a). But this seems to be based on the thought that what makes\na position nominalist is the rejection of properties, numbers,\npropositions, etc. In this entry, however, I shall understand\nNominalism in a broader way, namely as encompassing positions\nimplementing strategies (a) or (b) above. For Nominalism has nothing\nagainst properties, numbers, propositions, possible worlds, etc.,\nas such. What Nominalism finds uncongenial in entities like\nproperties, numbers, possible worlds and propositions is that they are\nsupposed to be universals or abstract objects. Thus the mere rejection\nof properties, numbers, possible worlds, propositions, etc., does not\nmake one a nominalist – to be a nominalist one needs to reject\nthem because they are supposed to be universals or abstract\nobjects. Michael Jubien, for instance, rejects propositions, but he\nadmits properties and relations construed Platonistically; his reasons\nfor rejecting propositions have nothing to do with their alleged\nabstract character (Jubien 2001: 48–54). It would be odd to call\nJubien a nominalist about propositions. \n\nThus according to my usage in this entry, acceptance of the existence\nof properties, propositions, possible worlds and numbers is compatible\nwith being a nominalist. What is required of nominalists who accept\nthe existence of numbers, properties, possible worlds and propositions\nis that they think of them as particulars or concrete\nobjects.[2] And\nrejecting properties, propositions, possible worlds, numbers, and any\nother items is not sufficient for being a Nominalist about them: to be\na Nominalist one must reject them on account of their being universal\nor abstract objects. \n\nWhat is an abstract object? There is no standard definition of the\nphrase. Perhaps the most common conception of abstract objects is that\nof non-spatiotemporal and causally inert objects. Often the requirement\nthat abstract objects are causally inert is not an independent\ncondition but is derived from the requirement that abstract objects are\nnot spatiotemporal since it is assumed that only spatiotemporal\nentities can enter in causal relations. \n\nBut this conception of abstract objects has been criticised. Games\nand languages are supposedly abstract and yet they are temporal\nentities, since they come into being at a certain point in time, and\nsome of them develop and change in time (Hale 1987, 49). Defining\nabstract objects simply as causally inert objects also presents\nproblems (see, for example, the entry on \n abstract objects). \n\nThere have been other proposals as to how to characterise abstract\nobjects. One approach defines abstract objects as those the\nunderstanding of whose names involves a recognition that the named\nobject is in the range of a certain functional expression (Dummett\n1973, 485). It has also been thought that an abstract object is one\nthat either couldn't possibly exist or couldn't possibly be concrete,\ndepending on whether you interpret the predicate ‘E!’\n(used to formally represent the definition of ‘abstract’)\nas an existence predicate or a concreteness predicate (Zalta 1983, 60,\n50-52). On another conception of\nabstract objects these are objects that cannot exist separately from\nother entities (Lowe 1995, \n 514).[3] \n (For a discussion of the various ways\nof characterising the abstract/concrete distinction see Burgess and Rosen\n1997, 13–25.) \n\nThere are thus several alternative conceptions of abstract objects.\nBut in what follows I shall take abstract objects to be those that are\nnon-spatiotemporal and causally inert. This is because what motivates\nNominalism (in one of its senses) is basically the rejection of\nnon-spatiotemporal and causally inert objects. That is, the nominalist\nsees trouble with abstract objects simply because he sees trouble with\nnon-spatiotemporal, causally inert objects. That this is so can be seen\nfrom the fact that nominalist theories are often motivated by\nempiricist or naturalist views, which find no place for\nnon-spatiotemporal, causally inert \n objects.[4] \n Thus, for example, one of\nthe main problems with mathematical objects — a subclass of\nabstract objects — from a nominalist point of view is that it is\nnot easy to see how we can come to have knowledge or form reliable\nbeliefs about them and refer to them, since there are no causal\nrelations between them and us. But this presupposes that what makes\nabstract objects problematic is their causal inertness. And the source\nof their causal inertness might be their lack of spatiotemporality. \n\nThe characterisation of abstract objects as non-spatiotemporal and\ncausally inert objects might be thought unsatisfactory to the extent\nthat it tells us only what they are not, but not what they are. But\nthis is not a problem for the nominalist. The business of the\nnominalist is to reject such objects, not to characterise them in a\npositive way. And for the purposes of rejecting abstract objects, their\ncharacterisation as non-spatiotemporal, causally inert objects is a\nreasonably clear characterisation (at least as clear as the notions of\nspatiotemporal object, causation, causal power, and related ones\nare). \n\nHistorically the distinction between abstract and concrete objects\nhas been thought of as exclusive and exhaustive. But the exhaustiveness\nof the distinction has recently been questioned. Linsky and Zalta argue\nthat while abstract objects are necessarily abstract, there are objects\nwhich are not concrete but could have been concrete. These objects are\nnon-concrete in virtue of being non-spatiotemporal and causally inert\nbut they are not abstract since they could have been concrete (Linsky\nand Zalta 1994). Since Nominalism rejects abstract objects because of\ntheir non-spatiotemporality and their causal inertness, Nominalism also\nrejects non-concrete objects. \n\nThe nominalist about universals rejects universals — but what\nare they? The distinction between particulars and universals is usually\ntaken to be both exhaustive and exclusive, but whether there is such a\ndistinction is \n controversial.[5] \n The distinction can be drawn in terms of\na relation of instantiation: we can say that something is a universal\nif and only if it can be instantiated (whether\nit can be instantiated by particulars or universals) — otherwise\nit is a particular. Thus while both particulars and universals can\ninstantiate entities, only universals can be instantiated. If\nwhiteness is a universal then every white thing is an instance\nof it. But the things that are white, e.g. Socrates, cannot have any\n instances.[6] \n\nRealists about universals typically think that properties (e.g.\nwhiteness), relations (e.g. betweenness), and kinds (e.g. gold) are\nuniversals. Where do universals exist? Do they exist in the things that\ninstantiate them? Or do they exist outside them? To maintain the second\noption is to maintain an ante rem realism about universals. If\nuniversals exist outside their instances then it is plausible to\nsuppose that they exist outside space and time. If so, assuming their\nconsequent causal inertness, universals are abstract objects. To\nmaintain that universals exist in their instances is to maintain an\nin re realism about universals. If universals exist in their\ninstances, and their instances exist in space or time, then it is\nplausible to think that universals exist in space or time, in which\ncase they are concrete. In this case universals can be multiply\nlocated, i.e. they can occupy more than one place at the same time, for\nin re universals are wholly located at each place they occupy\n(thus if there is whiteness in re, then such a thing can be\nsix meters apart from itself). \n\nThus, both on ante rem and in re realism about\nuniversals, universals enjoy a relation with space very different from\nthat apparently enjoyed by ordinary objects of experience like houses,\nhorses and men. For such particulars are located in space and time and cannot\nbe located in more than one place at the same time. But universals are\neither not located in space or else they can occupy more than one place\nat the same time. \n\nAre there general arguments against abstract objects? There are\nsome, although it must be said that some of the most famous deniers of\nabstract objects have not always based their rejection on arguments.\nThis is the case, for instance, of Goodman and Quine who, in their\nSteps toward a Constructive Nominalism, base their rejection\nof mathematical abstract objects on a basic intuition (1947, 105). \n\nOne argument against postulating abstract objects is based on\nOckham's razor. According to this principle one should not\nmultiply entities or kinds of entities unnecessarily. Thus if one can\nshow that certain concrete objects can perform the theoretical roles\nusually associated with abstract objects, one should refrain from\npostulating abstract objects. The effectiveness of this kind of appeal\nto Ockham's razor is, of course, conditional upon our having been\nshown that concrete objects can play the theoretical roles associated\nwith abstract objects. But if every theoretical role played by\nabstracta can be played by concreta and vice versa,\nthen one needs a further reason why one should postulate\nconcreta only rather than abstracta only. Sometimes\nthe only evidence for the existence of the abstracta in\nquestion is that they perform the theoretical role in question. In that\ncase one can use the principle that one should not postulate ad\nhoc entities or kinds of entities unnecessarily (Rodriguez-Pereyra\n2002, 210–16). That is, one should not postulate, if possible,\nentities for which there is no independent evidence, i.e. entities for\nthe existence of which the only evidence available is that they\nsatisfactorily perform a certain theoretical role. \n\nAnother common and widely discussed argument against abstract\nobjects is an epistemological argument. The argument is grounded in the\nthought that given that abstract objects are causally inert, it is\ndifficult to understand how we can have knowledge or reliable belief\nabout them. Sometimes a similar argument is advanced according to which\nthe problem with Platonism is that, given the causal inertness of\nabstract objects, it cannot explain how linguistic or mental reference\nto abstract objects is possible (see Benacerraf 1973 and Field 1989,\n25–7). Admittedly these arguments do not conclusively establish\nNominalism but, if they work, they show an explanatory lacuna\nin Platonism. The challenge for the Platonist is to explain how\nknowledge of and reference to abstract objects is possible. Most of the\ndebate with respect to this argument has concentrated on the particular\napplication of the argument to the case of mathematical objects (for\nmore on this debate see the entry on\n Platonism in metaphysics \n and Burgess and Rosen 1997, pp.\n35–60.) \n\nAnother, now less common, argument against Platonism, is that its\nontology is unintelligible. Sometimes the unintelligibility of abstract\nobjects is linked to their lack of clear and intelligible conditions of\nidentity. But it is not the abstractness of abstract objects that makes\nthem lack clear identity conditions, since some abstract objects, like\nsets, have clear and intelligible conditions of identity. But the\nidentity conditions for sets are intelligible only if the notion of a\nset is intelligible. Some, like Goodman, are apparently unable to\nunderstand how different entities can be composed out of the same\nultimate constituents. But, again, it is not in virtue of being\nabstract, i.e. non-spatiotemporal and causally inert, that sets violate\nGoodman's principle on composition. For there could be\nsimple abstract objects. \n\nMany of these arguments and motivations for the rejection of\nabstract objects are also arguments and motivations for rejecting\nnon-spatiotemporal ante rem universals. But Ockham's razor can\nalso be used against universals conceived of as spatiotemporal\nentities, provided it can be shown that particulars can play the\ntheoretical roles normally assigned to in re universals. For even if\nthey are spatiotemporal, universals are nevertheless a distinctive kind\nof entity. \n\nThere are other, more specific arguments against universals. One is\nthat postulating such things leads to a vicious infinite regress. For\nsuppose there are universals, both monadic and relational, and that\nwhen an entity instantiates a universal, or a group of entities\ninstantiate a relational universal, they are linked by an instantiation\nrelation. Suppose now that a instantiates the universal\nF. Since there are many things that instantiate many\nuniversals, it is plausible to suppose that instantiation is a\nrelational universal. But if instantiation is a relational universal,\nwhen a instantiates F, a,\nF and the instantiation relation are linked by an instantiation\nrelation. Call this instantiation relation i2 (and suppose\nit, as is plausible, to be distinct from the instantiation relation\n(i1) that links a and F). Then\nsince i2 is also a universal, it looks as\nif a,\nF, i1 and i2\nwill have to be linked by another instantiation\nrelation i3, and so on ad\ninfinitum. (This argument has its source in Bradley 1893,\n27–8.) \n\nWhether this regress shows some sort of incoherence in realism about\nuniversals or is merely uneconomical is a debatable issue. The realist\nabout universals can, however, maintain that the regress is illusory,\nfor instance by maintaining that although particulars instantiate\nuniversals, this involves no relation between them (Armstrong 1997,\n 118).[7] \n\nOther arguments against universals are based on the principles that\nthere cannot be necessary connections between wholly distinct\nexistences and that no two things can be composed of exactly the same\n parts.[8] \n Consider the universal methane. A molecule\ninstantiates methane if and only if it consists of four\nhydrogen atoms bonded to a single carbon atom. Thus, necessarily,\nmethane is instantiated only if carbon is\ninstantiated. But this seems to be a necessary connection between two\nwholly distinct entities, the universals methane and\ncarbon. One answer here is that methane and\ncarbon are not wholly distinct universals since the universal\ncarbon is a component or a part of the universal\nmethane, the other parts being the universal hydrogen\nand the relational universal bonded. The problem here is that\na molecule instantiates butane if and only if it consists of a\nchain of four carbon atoms, with the adjacent ones bonded, and the end\ncarbon atoms are bonded to three hydrogen atoms each, while the middle\ncarbon atoms are bonded to two hydrogen atoms each (thus the formula\nfor butane is\nCH3-CH2-CH2-CH3). So, if\nbutane is not to be necessarily connected to wholly distinct\nuniversals, one should say that carbon, hydrogen and\nbonded are the parts of butane. But then\nmethane and butane are composed of exactly the same\nparts. So it looks as if structural universals (i.e. universals like\nmethane and butane, such that whatever instantiates\nthem must consist of parts instantiating certain universals and\nstanding in certain relations to each other) offend either against the\nprinciple that there are no necessary connections between wholly\ndistinct existences or the principle that no two entities can be\ncomposed of exactly the same parts (see Lewis 1986b for further\ndiscussion). \n\nThis, in itself, is not an argument against universals per\nse but only against structural universals. Even so, if a\ntheory of universals must postulate states of affairs, as Armstrong\nthinks it must, then the argument can be made to work against\nuniversals in general. For the state of affairs that Rab\n(where R is any non-symmetrical relation) necessitates that\nb exists, which seems to be a necessary connection between\nwholly distinct existences. And saying that a, b and\nR are parts of the state of affairs that Rab means\ntrouble if one thinks that no two entities can be composed of exactly\nthe same parts, for the distinct state of affairs that Rba\nwould also be composed of a, b and R. There\nare two things the defender of universals can do: (a) to accept simple,\nnon-structural universals but reject both structural universals and\nstates of affairs; (b) to accept that some entities can be composed of\nexactly the same parts (provided they are related in different ways).\n(b) seems to be more popular among realists about universals. (See\nArmstrong 1986, Forrest 1986b and Armstrong 1997, 31–38, for\nfurther discussion.) \n\nGiven that nominalists about universals believe only in particulars,\nthere are two strategies that they might implement regarding the\nquestion of the alleged existence of allegedly universal entities like\nproperties and relations. One strategy is to reject the existence of\nsuch entities. Another strategy is to accept that such entities exist\nbut to deny that they are universals. Both strategies have been\nimplemented in the history of philosophy. One way to implement these\nstrategies is to provide nominalistically acceptable paraphrases or\nanalyses of sentences that appear (a) to be true and (b) imply the\nexistence of universals. Another way, more fashionable nowadays, is to\ngive a nominalistic account of the truthmakers for sentences that are\napparently made true by universals. \n\nWhat follows is a brief review of the main nominalistic positions of\nthis sort, and of some of the problems they face. For the sake of\nbrevity I shall illustrate the positions only with respect to\nproperties. The extension to kinds and relations is straightforward and\nonly occasionally do I say what a certain theory says about\nrelations. \n\nProperties are entities that are meant to play different theoretical\nroles. For instance, one role they are meant to play is that of being\nthe semantic values of predicates. Another role is that of accounting\nfor similarity and the causal powers of things. But there is no reason\nwhy these different roles should be played by one and the same kind of\nentity. When philosophers nowadays discuss the issue of universals they\nnormally think of properties as entities that account for the\nsimilarity and causal powers of things. Properties in this sense are\nsometimes called sparse properties, as opposed to\nabundant properties (the distinction between sparse and\nabundant properties comes from Lewis 1983). Sparse properties are those\nwhich would be sufficient to account for the similarity and causal\npowers of things, and to characterise them completely and without\nredundancy. In what follows it is assumed, for the sake of example,\nthat properties like being square and being scarlet\ncount as sparse. \n\nThe question that realists and nominalists about universals try to\nanswer is: What makes F-things F\n(where “F” is a sparse property\npredicate)? For instance, what makes a square thing square? For the\nrealist about universals if something is square, this is in virtue of\nthe thing instantiating the universal squareness. In general, for the\nrealist about universals, things have the sparse properties they do in\nvirtue of instantiating universals. \n\nHow do nominalists answer this question? A popular nominalist theory\nof properties is so-called Trope Theory, which has been held by Donald\nWilliams (1953), Keith Campbell (1990), and Douglas Ehring (2011) among others. Trope theory\ndoes not reject the existence of properties, but takes properties to be\ncertain entities usually called ‘tropes’. Tropes are\nparticulars, in the same sense in which individual people and\nindividual apples are particulars. Thus when there is a scarlet apple\nthe scarletness of the apple is not a universal but a particular\nscarletness, the scarletness of this apple, which exists\nexactly where and when this apple is \n scarlet.[9] \nSuch a\nparticular scarletness is a trope. The apple is scarlet not in virtue\nof instantiating a universal but in virtue of possessing a scarlet\ntrope. \n\nBut what makes scarlet tropes scarlet tropes? One possible answer\nhere is that scarlet tropes are scarlet tropes because they resemble\neach other, where resemblance is not explained in terms of\ninstantiating some same universal. Of course crimson tropes also\nresemble each other. What makes a trope scarlet is that it resembles\nthese tropes (the scarlet ones) as opposed to resembling those ones\n(the crimson ones). \n\nAnother answer would be that scarlet tropes form a primitive natural\nclass (this view has been forcefully defended by Ehring 2011:\n175-241). But whether or not what makes scarlet tropes scarlet tropes\nis that they resemble each other, scarlet tropes do resemble each\nother.  And the fact that they do raises an important problem. This is\nthe problem of the resemblance regress. Suppose\nthat a, b and c are scarlet apples. If so,\neach one has its own scarlet trope: call\nthem sa, sb, and\nsc. Since sa,\nsb, and sc are scarlet tropes,\nevery two of them resemble each other. But then there are three\nresemblance tropes as well: the resemblance between\nsa and sb, the resemblance\nbetween sa and sc, and the\nresemblance between sb and sc.\nBut these resemblance tropes, since they are resemblance tropes,\nresemble each other. So there are ‘second-order’\nresemblance tropes: the resemblance between the resemblance between\nsa and sb and the resemblance\nbetween sa and sc, the\nresemblance between the resemblance between sa and\nsb and the resemblance between\nsb and sc, and the resemblance\nbetween the resemblance between sa and\nsc and the resemblance between\nsb and sc. But these\n‘second-order’ resemblance tropes resemble each other. So\nthere are ‘third-order’ resemblance tropes, and so on\nad infinitum. \n\nThere are some ways out for the trope theorist. One solution is to\nargue that the regress is not vicious at all and that at most it\nrepresents an increment in the number of entities (not kinds\nof entities) postulated by the theory. Another solution is to deny the\nexistence of resemblance tropes and make do only with resembling tropes\n(for further discussion see Daly 1997 and Maurin 2002,\n96–115). \n\nThere are other forms of nominalism about universals, two of which\nare Predicate Nominalism and Concept Nominalism. The realist about\nuniversals admits that the predicate ‘scarlet’ applies to a\nscarlet thing. But he says that the predicate ‘scarlet’\napplies to it in virtue of its being scarlet, which is nothing else\nthan its instantiating the universal scarletness. Similarly he says\nthat the thing in question falls under the concept scarlet in\nvirtue of being scarlet, which is nothing else than the thing\ninstantiating the universal scarletness. But for Predicate\nNominalism there is nothing like scarletness. According to this theory\na thing is scarlet in virtue of the fact that the predicate\n‘scarlet’ applies to it. Similarly, according to Concept\nNominalism (or Conceptualism), there is nothing like scarletness and a\nthing is scarlet in virtue of its falling under the concept\n scarlet.[10]\n These two views entail that if there were no\nspeakers or thinkers, things would not be scarlet. If only because of\nthis many would feel inclined towards another view, called Ostrich\n Nominalism.[11]\n This view, held by Quine, among others, maintains\nthat there is nothing in virtue of which our thing is scarlet: it just\nis scarlet (Devitt 1980, 97). But many think that being scarlet cannot\nbe a metaphysically ultimate fact, but that there must be something in\nvirtue of which scarlet things are scarlet. \n\nAnother theory is Mereological Nominalism, according to which the\nproperty of being scarlet is the aggregate of scarlet things, and for\nwhich something is scarlet in virtue of being a part of the aggregate\nof scarlet \n things.[12]\n An aggregate, or mereological sum, is a\nparticular. But the theory faces a difficulty with so-called extensive\nproperties like mass and shape. Not every part of the aggregate of\nsquare things is square since, for instance, not every sum of squares\nis itself square, and not every part of a square is itself square. So\nit is false that square things are square in virtue of being parts of\nthe aggregate of square things. \n\nA better theory in the same spirit is Class Nominalism, a\nversion of which was maintained by Lewis (1983). Whether abstract or\nnot, classes are particular on this \n view.[13]\n According to Class\nNominalism properties are classes of things, and so the property of\nbeing scarlet is the class of all and only scarlet\n things.[14] \n\nOne problem with this theory is that no two classes can have the\nsame members, while it does not seem that properties with the same\ninstances need be the same. So there is no guarantee that the\nidentification of properties with classes is correct. And even if\ncorrect, the identification is clearly not necessarily correct.\nFurthermore, if every F is a G and\nvice versa, the theory forces us to say that what makes something\nF is the same as what makes it G. But\nwhile every F might be a G and vice\nversa, it does not follow that what makes things F is\nthe same as what makes them G. \n\nOne solution to this is to embrace a version of Modal Realism, for\ninstance David Lewis', according to which other possible worlds\nexist and contain things of the same kinds as the things in the actual\nworld (see Lewis 1986a). Then properties get identified with classes\nwhose members need not belong to the same possible world. Thus the\nproperty of scarlet things is the class of things that are scarlet in\nany possible \n world.[15]\n And even if every actual F is a\nG and vice versa, since not every possible\nF is a G or vice versa, what makes\nsomething F, namely belonging to the class of actual\nand possible Fs, is not the same as what makes it\nG. The theory denies that there are and there could be\nnecessarily coextensive properties. \n\nAnother version of Nominalism is Resemblance Nominalism. According\nto this theory, it is not that scarlet things resemble one another\nbecause they are scarlet, but what makes them scarlet is that they\nresemble one another. Thus what makes something scarlet is that it\nresembles the scarlet things. Similarly, what makes square things\nsquare is that they resemble one another, and so what makes something\nsquare is that it resembles the square things. Resemblance is\nfundamental and primitive and so either there are no properties or the\nproperties of a thing depend on what things it resembles. \n\nThus on one version of the theory a property like being\nscarlet is a certain class whose members satisfy certain definite\nresemblance conditions. On another version of the theory there are no\nproperties, but what makes scarlet things scarlet is that they satisfy\ncertain resemblance conditions. \n\nWhat are these resemblance conditions? Sometimes the resemblance\nconditions include some that must be satisfied, not by the things in\nquestion (e.g. not by the scarlet things), but by things suitably\nrelated to them. For instance, in the version of Resemblance Nominalism\ndeveloped in Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002, what makes scarlet things scarlet\nis that they resemble each other, that there is a degree of resemblance\nd such that no two scarlet things, and no two\nnth-order pairs (two-membered unordered classes) whose\nur-elements are scarlet things, resemble each other to a degree less\nthan d, and that the class of scarlet things is or fails to be\nincluded in certain other classes defined in terms of resemblance\nconditions like the ones just mentioned (see Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002,\n156–98, for details). Of course the crimson things also resemble\neach other and they also meet the other conditions having to do with\nresemblance degrees and their class being or failing to be included in\ncertain other classes. But this does not mean that what makes something\nscarlet is what makes something crimson: what makes a scarlet thing\nscarlet is that it resembles these things (i.e. the scarlet\nones), which happen to satisfy the stated conditions having to do with\nresemblance degrees and their class being or failing to be included in\ncertain other classes while what makes a crimson thing crimson is that\nit resembles those things (i.e. the crimson ones), which also\nhappen to satisfy the stated conditions having to do with resemblance\ndegrees and their class being or failing to be included in certain\nother classes. \n\nThe resemblance nominalist ontology is an ontology of resembling\nparticulars like horses, atoms, houses, stars, men (and classes). But\nthe resemblance nominalist does not reify resemblance. Thus that\na and b resemble each other does not require that\nthere are three entities there: a, b and a third,\nrelational entity that is their resemblance. The only entities\ninvolved in that situation are a and b. In this\nrespect, Resemblance Nominalism resembles Ostrich Nominalism. The\ndifference is that whereas the latter admits many sorts of basic facts\ninvolving only particulars – ‘a is\nscarlet’, ‘b is an electron’ – the\nformer admits only basic facts of the form ‘a\nresembles b to such and such a degree’. \n\nLike Class Nominalism, Resemblance Nominalism faces the problem\nabout the identity of coextensive properties, and the solution is the\nsame, namely to adopt some version of Modal Realism according to which\nmerely possible particulars are as real as actual ones. Thus (part of)\nwhat makes a certain apple scarlet is that it resembles all scarlet\nthings, including merely possible scarlet things. \n\nRussell (1912, 96–7) and others think that Resemblance\nNominalism faces the resemblance regress. But this regress presupposes\nthat resemblances are entities that can resemble one another. Since\nResemblance Nominalism does not reify resemblances, the regress does\nnot arise (see Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002, 105–23, for further\ndiscussion). \n\nFinally, there is Causal Nominalism, according to which what makes it\ntrue that a is F is that a would stand in certain\ncausal relations given certain circumstances. In other words, the\nclaim is that for a to be F is for the theory that\nwhich charts out the functional role of F-particulars to be\ntrue of a (Whittle 2009, 246). F-particulars will\nresemble each other in realising the same functional role, but this\ndoes not collapse Causal Nominalism into Resemblance Nominalism, since\nsuch resemblances are not what explains why a is F,\nbut a consequence of what explains that, namely the fact that such\nparticulars realise a certain functional role (Whittle 2009:\n255). Similar reasons might also suggest that Causal Nominalism does\nnot collapse into any of the other nominalisms. But it has been argued\nthat to be thoroughly nominalistic, Causal Nominalism owes a\nnominalistic account of what it is for different particulars to\nrealise the same functional role, and such an account can only be in\nterms of any of the nominalisms distinguished above, in which case\nCausal Nominalism collapses into some other form of nominalism (Tugby\n2013). \n\nWhich one of these theories is the best has to be decided by\ncomparing how they score with respect to certain theoretical virtues,\nlike accommodating firm and stable intuitions and common sense\nopinions, avoiding the unnecessary multiplication of entities, reducing\nthe number of undefined primitive concepts, etc. \n\nMost theories of propositions take them to be abstract or imply that\nthey are. One can divide theories of propositions into those that take\nthem to be structured entities and those that take them to be\nunstructured entities. Each conception comprises a family of\ntheories. \n\nThe most popular conceptions of unstructured propositions are those\nthat take them to be either sets of possible worlds or functions from\npossible worlds to truth-values (Lewis 1986a, 53; Stalnaker 1987, 2).\nOn these theories a proposition is the set of possible worlds in which\nit is true, or a function that has the value True when it\ntakes as argument a world where the proposition is true and has the\nvalue False when it takes as argument a world where the\nproposition is false. \n\nBut sets are, prima facie, abstract objects. So it looks as\nif those who take propositions to be sets of possible worlds should\ncount as platonists about propositions. But some people, like Lewis\n(1986a, 83) and Maddy (1990, 59), believe that sets of spatiotemporally\nlocated members are spatiotemporally located where and when their\nmembers are, in which case sets of spatiotemporally located members are\n concrete.[16]\n But since it lacks any members, the empty set is not\nspatiotemporally located. And since there are necessarily false\npropositions, that is, propositions that are true in no possible world,\nit is plausible, on this conception of propositions, to identify these\npropositions with the empty set. So some propositions (at least one)\nseem to be abstract objects. And functions also seem to be abstract\nobjects. And the truth values True and False seem to\nbe abstract objects as well. So these accounts of propositions as sets\nof possible worlds or functions from possible worlds to truth values,\nif they are to be nominalistic accounts of propositions, require some\nconsistent and plausible nominalistic account of pure sets, functions\nand truth values as concrete objects. \n\nThere are other theories of propositions that take them to be\nunstructured entities. George Bealer has a conception of unstructured\npropositions according to which they are sui generis\nirreducible intensional entities. His propositions can exist even if\nthe objects they are about do not exist and they can be actual even if\nthe objects they are about are not actual (Bealer 2006, 232–4).\nSuch propositions are abstract objects. \n\nAmong conceptions of propositions as structured entities one can\ndistinguish, roughly, between Russellian and Fregean versions. Both the\nRussellian and the Fregean conceptions of propositions are\nfamilies of theories. In general Fregean theories will take a\nproposition to be a complex entity with a particular structure whose\nconstituents are senses. But senses are abstract objects. And\nif, as seems plausible, a complex entity whose constituents are\nabstract objects must be an abstract object itself (how could an object\nbe in space or time when its constituents exist neither in space nor\ntime?), then, on this account, propositions are abstract objects. \n\nAccording to the Russellian conception of propositions, a\nproposition is a complex entity with a particular structure whose\nconstituents are particulars and/or properties and/or \n relations.[17]\n Are\npropositions of this sort abstract objects? If all the particulars are\nconcrete then perhaps propositions are concrete objects, even if\nproperties and relations are abstract. For one may say that\npropositions are where and when the particulars which are their\nconstituents are. But this sounds arbitrary. Why not say that\npropositions are where their constituent properties and relations are,\nthat is, nowhere? In any case, that particulars (and even properties\nand relations) are concrete does not immediately settle the matter\nwhether propositions in the sense of complexes of particulars and\nproperties and/or relations are abstract objects. For what kind of\ncomplex entities are propositions? Sometimes they are considered to be\nordered sets. If this is what propositions are, then\nthe nominalist needs a satisfactory nominalistic account of ordered\nsets. If propositions are another kind of complex entity, then the\nnominalist about propositions must make sure that objects of that kind\nare concrete. \n\nOne nominalist option is to show that the roles associated with\npropositions (e.g. being truth-bearers and objects of propositional\nattitudes) are actually played by concrete objects. One common thought\nhere is to propose that sentences play the roles associated by\npropositions. This strategy is exemplified by Quine. In Word and\nObject he proposes eternal sentences as truth-bearers (Quine 1960,\n208). Eternal sentences are better as truth-bearers than other\nsentences in being true or false independently of time, place, speaker\nand the like. But they are as bad as other sentences in admitting of\nvariation in truth value from one language to another (Quine 1969,\n 142).[18]\n But note that from the point of view of a nominalist about\nabstract objects, there is a much worse problem with eternal sentences,\nnamely that they may be abstract objects. They may be abstract objects\nbecause they are sentence types, and a type may be an abstract\nobject, for instance if one takes them to be sets or abstract\nuniversals (admittedly one might attempt to take them to be\nnon-abstract universals). \n\nThe alternative is to take concrete token sentences (utterances or\nwritten inscriptions) as the objects that play the roles normally\nassociated with propositions. One problem here is that only a finite\nnumber of sentences ever get uttered. And so some find it difficult to\nmake sense of general logical laws, e.g. the law that any two\nfalsehoods form a false disjunction, since the disjunction may not get\nuttered or written (Quine 1969, 143). (One possible solution might be\nto reformulate the law so as to say that if the disjunction of\nP and Q exists, it is false if and only if\nP and Q are false.) \n\nIn this area, as in many others, a nominalist strategy is to supply\na nominalistically acceptable paraphrase of sentences that appear to\nposit abstract entities. That is, there are certain sentences that seem\nto be true and whose truth seems to entail that there are propositions.\nThe nominalist can then paraphrase those sentences into others which\nallegedly mean the same and whose truth seems to entail only the\nexistence of, say, token sentences. For example, ‘Seneca said\nthat man is a rational animal’ is true and seems to entail that\nthere is a proposition, namely what Seneca said. But according to\nScheffler's inscriptionalism, on which that-clauses are treated\nas single predicates of concrete inscriptions, to say that Seneca said\nthat man is a rational animal is simply to say that Seneca produced a\nthat-man-is-a-rational-animal inscription (Scheffler 1954, 84). \n\nSo we have a sentence whose truth apparently entails the existence\nof propositions and an alleged paraphrase that apparently entails the\nexistence of concrete inscriptions only. Assuming that they do have the\nsame meaning (in which case both sentences entail exactly the same),\nwhy think that the apparent ontological commitments (i.e. those\nentities the truth of a sentence appears to entail) of the nominalistic\nparaphrase are the real ontological commitments of both the paraphrase\nand the original sentence? The fact that the original sentence and its\nparaphrase are semantically equivalent does not give any reason to\nthink that the real ontological commitments of both are the apparent\nontological commitments of the paraphrase rather than those of the\noriginal sentence. (This point has its source in Alston 1958,\n9–10.) What the nominalist must do is to argue that the\nparaphrase reveals and makes apparent the real meaning of the original\nsentence, so that the apparent commitments of the paraphrase are the\nreal commitments of both paraphrase and original sentence. \n\nAnother nominalist option is to deny that there are propositions and\nany entities that play their theoretical roles. If so, apparently true\nsentences that entail the existence of propositions are false. Thus\nthis kind of Nominalism about propositions is a sort of fictionalism,\ncalled semantic fictionalism (Balaguer \n 1998).[19]\n Thus a\nsentence like ‘Nestor believed that the gods do not give men all\nthings at the same time’ is not true on this account because (a)\n‘that’-clauses (like ‘that the gods do not give men\nall things at the same time’) are referential singular terms, (b)\nif anything is the referent of ‘that the gods do not give men all\nthings at the same time’, this is a proposition, and (c) there\nare no propositions. Thus talk about propositions is a fiction, since\nthere aren't any, but it is a useful fiction since it is a\ndescriptive aid that allows us to make it easier to say what we want to\nsay about the world and it allows us to represent the structure of\ncertain parts of the world — for instance the logico-linguistic\nstructure of propositions can be used to represent the empirical\nstructure of belief states (Balaguer 1998, 817–18). \n\nThe word ‘Nominalism’ is not very often used to refer to\nany stance with respect to possible worlds. But since some philosophers\ntake possible worlds to be abstract objects, a nominalist about\npossible worlds will be, for the purposes of this section, someone who\nthinks that possible worlds are not abstract objects, and this will\ninclude those who believe that there are no possible worlds (but not\nthose who simply do not believe that they \n exist).[20] \n\nThe question about the nature of possible worlds is a hotly debated\ntopic. Some, for instance Alvin Plantinga, think that possible worlds\nare states of affairs that are both possible and maximal. A maximal\nstate of affairs is one that includes or precludes every state of\naffairs — where a state of affairs S includes a state\nof affairs S* if and only if it is not possible that S\nobtain and S* fail to obtain, and S precludes S*\nif and only if it is not possible that both obtain (Plantinga 1974,\n45; 2003a, 107; 2003b,\n 194).[21] \n According to Plantinga possible but not necessary\nstates of affairs can obtain and can fail to obtain. Those states of\naffairs that obtain are actual. The actual world includes every actual\nstate of affairs (Plantinga 2003a, 107; 2003b, 195). Merely possible\nstates of affairs and worlds exist but do not obtain (Plantinga 2003a,\n107; 2003b, 195). States of affairs, and therefore possible worlds,\nare thought of as abstract objects by Plantinga. Indeed even the\nactual world is an abstract object for Plantinga, since it has no\ncenter of mass, it is neither a concrete object nor a mereological sum\nof concrete objects and, like the state of affairs of Ford's being\ningenious, has no spatial parts at all (2003a, 107). \n\nFor Stalnaker possible worlds are ways the world might have been and\nsuch ways are properties (2003, 7). All these ways the world might have\nbeen actually exist but only one of them is instantiated — the\nway the world actually is. He naturally takes these properties to be\nabstract objects (2003, \n 32).[22]\n A view like this has been further\ndeveloped by Peter Forrest, who proposes certain properties that he\ncalls natures (certain conjunctions of natural non-relational\nproperties) to play the role played by possible worlds. These natures\nare, for the most part, uninstantiated properties (1986a, 15). It is\nnatural to think that they are abstract \n objects.[23] \n\nAnother option is to take possible worlds as maximally consistent\nsets of propositions. R. M. Adams (1974) sketched such a theory. If\npropositions are abstract objects, then on this theory possible worlds\nare abstract objects. But there are other options open. Adams suggests\nthat someone might, à la Leibniz, take propositions to\nbe thoughts in the mind of God. But if so, and if God is in time and\ntherefore concrete, then presumably his thoughts also are. And if we\nassume that sets of spatiotemporally located entities are\nspatiotemporally located (because they are wherever and whenever their\nmembers are), then sets of concrete objects are concrete. Thus sets of\nthoughts of a concrete deity are concrete. \n\nAnother option would be to take possible worlds as sets of spacetime\npoints and think of each such set as representing the possibility that\nall and only the points in it are occupied (the view is proposed as an\nillustration in Cresswell 1972, \n 136).[24]\n This assumes, as Cresswell\nnotes, that all properties of things are determined by the properties\nof certain basic entities whose properties can all be expressed in\nterms of the spacetime points they occupy. If sets of spacetime points can be\nseen as concrete then this might be a way of taking possible worlds as\nconcrete. This view derives from certain passages by Quine, where he\ndevelops the idea that every distribution of space points could be\ntaken as a possible world momentary state (1969, 148). But to avoid\ncertain difficulties (some having to do with ontological economy,\nothers having to do with the notion of a point and the relativity of\nposition), Quine proposes to bypass spacetime points and takes possible\nworlds as certain sets of number quadruples (Quine\n1969, 151). To be nominalistically acceptable this account of possible\nworlds would need to be accompanied by a nominalistically acceptable\ntreatment of sets and numbers. \n\nAll the previously mentioned accounts of possible worlds are\nactualist in the sense that they take actual existence and existence\nsimpliciter to coincide. One of the most developed\nnominalistic accounts of possible worlds, that of David Lewis, is not\nactualist but possibilist: according to Lewis to exist\nsimpliciter is one thing and to be actual is another. For\nLewis ‘actual’ is an indexical predicate so that from the\npoint of view of each world only that world is actual and none of the\nothers are. Thus, unlike Plantinga, Adams, and Stalnaker, Lewis does not\ntake every possible world to exist actually. \n\nFor Lewis possible worlds are maximal sums of spatiotemporally\nrelated objects. A sum of spatiotemporally related objects is maximal\nif and only if nothing that is not part of the sum is spatiotemporally\nrelated to any part of the sum in question. Since sums of\nspatiotemporally related objects are sums of concrete objects, and sums\nof concrete objects are concrete objects, Lewisian possible worlds are\nconcrete \n objects.[25],[26] \n\nAnother theory of possible worlds has been developed\nby David Armstrong. Armstrong has an actualist combinatorialist theory\nof possibility, according to which what is possible is determined by\nappropriate combinations of actual elements (particulars and\nuniversals). The basic notion in Armstrong's theory of\npossibility and possible worlds is that of an atomic state of affairs.\nA state of affairs brings together a particular and a universal (if\nthe universal is a property), or some particulars and a universal (if\nthe universal is a \n relation).[27] \n\nThese elements (particulars and universals) define a range of\ncombinations, some of them actualised, some not. These combinations\nmust respect the form of states of affairs (thus Aristotle's\nbeing wise is an actualised combination, Aristotle's\nbeing a general is an unactualised combination, and\nwisdom's being Aristotle does not respect the form of\nstates of affairs and so does not fall in the range of combinations\ndefined by particulars and universals). The possible atomic states of\naffairs are the combinations of particulars and universals which\nrespect the form of states of affairs. The merely possible atomic\nstates of affairs are the recombinations of particulars and\nuniversals, i.e. those combinations which do not actually occur, like\nAristotle's being a \n general.[28]\n Possible worlds are, for\nArmstrong, conjunctions of possible atomic states of affairs (1989, 47,\n 48).[29] \n\nArmstrong's combinatorialism is actualist in the sense that\neverything that exists actually exists. But he does not identify his\nmerely possible states of affairs and merely possible worlds with\nactually existing entities. So merely possible states of affairs and\nworlds do not actually exist and, therefore, given Armstrong's\nactualism, do not exist at all (Armstrong 1989, 49). \n\nArmstrong's rejection of possible worlds is not exactly a nominalistic\nstance about them since his opposition to them is not based on their\nalleged abstract character. In believing that possible worlds do not\nexist, Armstrong is rather a kind of fictionalist about possible\nworlds, and so he calls himself (1989, 49). But if one believes that\npossible worlds do not exist, and so one is a fictionalist about\npossible worlds in this sense, one can also be a fictionalist about\npossible worlds in a different sense, namely the sense of\nso-called modal fictionalism. According to modal fictionalism\nsentences with an apparent quantification over possible worlds must be\nunderstood as quantification within the scope of a story prefix (Rosen\n1990, 332). Let PW be a theory that postulates possible\nworlds. ‘According to PW’ is then a story\nprefix.[30] Thus\nthe modal fictionalist says that when he utters ‘There is a\npossible world where there are blue swans’ what he is really\nsaying is that according to PW there is a world where there are blue\nswans (Rosen 1990, 332). But since quantification within a story\nprefix is not existentially committing, the modal fictionalist can\nutter things like ‘Since there might have been blue swans, there\nis a possible world where there are blue swans’ without\ncommitting himself to possible\n worlds.[31] \n\nNow, from the point of view of a nominalist, adoption of modal\nfictionalism must be coupled with some sort of nominalistically\nacceptable account of stories, or theories, or representations in\ngeneral. For accepting something like ‘According to PW there are\nworlds where there are blue swans’ seems to commit one to PW, and\nPW is a theory, and so one seems thereby committed to theories. But\ntheories seem to be abstract objects. So the fictionalist nominalist\nneeds a nominalist account of theories. If, for instance, theories are\nsets of propositions, a nominalist account of sets and propositions\nwould do as a nominalistic account of \n theories.[32]"}]
