The most\nimportant philosophers among them were\n Henry More\n (1614–1687) and\n Ralph Cudworth\n (1617–1688), both fellows of Christ’s College, Cambridge.\nThe group also included\n Benjamin Whichcote\n (1609–1683),\n Peter Sterry\n (1613–1672),\n John Smith\n (1618–1652),\n Nathaniel Culverwell\n (1619–1651), and John Worthington (1618–1671). All of\nthem studied at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, apart from More who\nstudied at Christ’s College, Cambridge, where Cudworth was later\nappointed Master. Their personal and intellectual fortunes were\nimpacted by events of the English Civil War and its aftermath. They\ndeveloped their philosophical views against a background of the\nCalvinistic scholasticism which prevailed at Cambridge in their\nformative years. They did not self-identify as a group or as\nPlatonists. They only came to be referred to as Platonists in the\neighteenth century. But in so far as they all held the philosophy of\nPlato and Plotinus in high regard, and adopted principles of Platonist\nepistemology and metaphysics, the designation ‘Platonist’ is apt.\nThey drew on a wide range of philosophical sources besides Platonism.\nFor example, among ancient philosophers, they were well acquainted\nwith Aristotle and with Stoicism. They shared the Renaissance\nHumanists’ regard for the achievements of ancient philosophy, as\nwell as their interpretation of ancient philosophy, which was informed\nby a strong sense of its relevance of to contemporary life. At the\nsame time, they were also very much abreast of new developments in\nphilosophy and science – with Descartes, Hobbes and Spinoza as\nwell as Bacon, Boyle and the Royal Society. Smith, Culverwell,\nCudworth and More were among the first Englishmen to read Descartes.\nBoth More and Cudworth were fellows of the Royal Society. The\nframework within which they read and understood ancient and modern\nphilosophy was that of the ‘perennial philosophy’\n(philosophia perennis) adopted by Italian Renaissance\nphilosophers such as Marsilio Ficino, and Agostino Steucho, but also\nemployed by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. They also emphatically\nrepudiated the scholasticism that prevailed in academic philosophy and\ntook a lively interest in the developments that brought about the\nscientific revolution. They therefore form part of the philosophical\nrevolution of the seventeenth century, especially since they sought an\nalternative philosophical foundation to Aristotelianism which was\nwaning fast in the face of challenges from scepticism and competing\nalternative philosophies, notably those of Hobbes and Descartes. \n\n\nAt a time when philosophy in the universities was considered the\nhandmaid of theology, they devoted their considerable philosophical\nlearning to religious and moral issues, to defending the existence of\nGod and the immortality of the soul, and to formulating a practical\nethics for Christian conduct. Convinced of the compatibility of reason\nand faith, hey held the eternal existence of moral principles and of\ntruth, and that the human mind is equipped with the principles of\nreason and morality. Their optimistic view of human capacities is\nunderscored by their emphasis on the freedom of the will. Their\nanti-determinism led them to propose arguments for human autonomy.\nThey were all dualists for whom mind is ontologically prior to matter,\nand for whom the truths of the mind are superior to sense-knowledge.\nThey accepted post-Galilean science, and propounded an atomistic\ntheory of matter. But they repudiated the new mechanistic natural\nphilosophy in favour of the view the fundamental causal principle in\nthe operations of nature is some form of immaterial agent or\nspirit.\n\nThe oldest member of the group, Benjamin Whichcote, is usually\nconsidered to be the founding father of Cambridge Platonism. During\nthe Civil War period, Whichcote was appointed Provost of King’s\nCollege, Cambridge, and he served as Vice Chancellor of the University\nin 1650. However, he was removed from his post at King’s College\nat the Restoration in 1660, and was obliged to seek employment\nelsewhere, as a clergyman in London. The interruption to his academic\ncareer may explain why he never published any philosophical treatises\nas such. The main source for his philosophical views are his\nposthumously-published sermons and aphorisms. Whichcote’s\ntolerant, optimistic and rational outlook set the intellectual tone\nfor Cambridge Platonism. Whichcote’s philosophical views are\ngrounded in his repudiation of Calvinist theology. He held that God\nbeing supremely perfect is necessarily good, wise and loving.\nWhichcote regarded human nature as rational and perfectible, and he\nbelieved that it is through reason as much as revelation that God\ncommunicates with man. ‘God is the most knowable of any thing in\nthe world’ (Patrides, 1969, p.58). Without reason we would have\nno means of demonstrating the existence of God, and no assurance that\nrevelation is from God. By reason Whichcote did not mean the\ndisputatious logic of the schools but discursive, demonstrative and\npractical reason enlightened by contemplation of the divine. He held\nthat moral principles are immutable absolutes which exist\nindependently of human minds and institutions, and that virtuous\nconduct is grounded in reason. Whichcote’s Aphorisms\namount to a manual of practical ethics which amply illustrates his\nconviction that the fruit reason is not ‘bare knowledge’\nbut action, or knowledge which ‘doth go forth into act’.\nIt is through reason that we gain knowledge of the natural world, and\nrecognise natural phenomena as ‘the EFFECTS OF GOD’.\nAlthough Whichcote’s published writings do not discuss natural\nphilosophy as such, his recognition of the demonstrative value of\nnatural philosophy for the argument from design anticipates the use of\nnatural philosophy in the apologetics of Cudworth and More. \nWhichcote’s optimism about human reason and his conviction that\nphilosophy properly belongs within the domain of religion, are shared\nby the other Cambridge Platonists, all of whom affirmed the\ncompatibility of reason and faith. The fullest statement of this\nposition is Henry More’s The Apology of Henry More\n(1664) which sets out rules for the application of reason in religious\nmatters, stipulating the use of only those ‘Philosophick\ntheorems’ which are ‘solid and rational in themselves, nor\nreally repugnant to the word of God’. Like Whichcote, Peter\nSterry, John Smith and Nathaniel Culverwell are known only through\nposthumously published writings. The first published treatise by any\nof the Cambridge Platonists was Nathaniel Culverwell’s An\nElegant and Learned Discourse of the Light of Nature of 1652.\nLike the other Cambridge Platonists Culverwell emphasises the freedom\nof the will and proposes an innatist epistemology, according to which\nthe mind is furnished with ‘clear and indelible\nPrinciples’ and reason an ‘intellectual lamp’ placed\nin the soul by God to enable it to understand God’s will\npromulgated in the law of nature. These innate principles of the mind\nalso include moral principles. The soul is a divine spark, which\nderives knowledge by inward contemplation, not outward observation.\nLike the other Cambridge Platonists, Culverwell held that goodness is\nintrinsic to all things, and that moral principles do not depend on\nthe will of God. He nevertheless underscored the importance of natural\nlaw as the foundation of moral obligation.. \nJohn Smith taught mathematics at Queen’s College until his\npremature death in 1652. His posthumously published Select\nDiscourses (1659) discusses a number of metaphysical and\nepistemological issues relating to religious belief – the\nexistence of God, immortality of the soul and the rationality of\nreligion. Smith outlines a hierarchy of four grades of cognitive\nascent from sense combined with reason, through reason in conjunction\nwith innate notions, and, thirdly, through disembodied,\nself-reflective reason; and finally divine love. \nPeter Sterry’s only philosophical work, his posthumously-published\nA Discourse of the Freedom of the Will (1675), is the most\nvisionary of all the writings of the Cambridge Platonists. Sterry was\ndeeply involved with events outside Cambridge as chaplain first to the\nParliamentary leader, Lord Brooke, and then to Oliver Cromwell. After\nthe death of Cromwell he retired to a Christian community in East\nSheen. In his Discourse Sterry argues that to act freely\nconsists in acting in accordance with ones nature, appropriately to\nones level of being, be that plant, animal or intellectual entity.\nHuman liberty is grounded in the divine essence and entails liberty of\nthe understanding and of the will. \nA life-long fellow of Christ’s College, Cambridge, Henry More\nwas the most prolific of the Cambridge Platonists. He was also the\nmost directly engaged in contemporary philosophical debate: not only\ndid he enter into correspondence with Descartes (between 1648 and\n1649) but he also wrote against Hobbes, and was one of the earliest\nEnglish critics of Spinoza (whom he attacks in Demonstrationum\nduarum propositionum ... confutatio and Epistola altera\nboth published in his Opera omnia, 1671). Although he\neventually became a critic of Cartesianism, he initially advocated the\nteaching of Cartesianism in English Universities. More’s\npublished writings included, besides philosophy, poetry, theology and\nbible commentary. His main philosophical works are his An Antidote\nAgainst Atheism (1653), his Of the Immortality of the\nSoul (1659), Enchiridion metaphysicum (1671), and\nEnchiridion ethicum (1667). Like the other Cambridge\nPlatonists, More used philosophy in defence of theism against the\nclaims of rational atheists. The most important statement of More’s\ntheological position his An Explanation of the Grand Mystery of\nGodliness appeared in 1660. In opposition to Calvinist\npessimistic voluntarism, this propounds a moral, rational\nprovidentialism in which he vindicates the goodness and justice of God\nby invoking the Origenist doctrine of the pre-existence of the soul.\nIt also makes the case for religious toleration.  \nIn his philosophical writings, More elaborated a philosophy of spirit\nwhich explained all the phenomena of mind and of the physical world as\nthe activity of spiritual substance controlling inert matter. More\nconceived of both spirit and body as spatially extended, but defined\nspiritual substance as the obverse of material extension: where body\nis inert and solid, but divisible; spirit is active and penetrable,\nbut indivisible. It was in his correspondence with Descartes that he\nfirst expounded his view that all substance, whether material or\nimmaterial, is extended. He went on to argue space is infinite,\nanticipating that other native of Grantham, Isaac Newton, and that God\nwho is an infinite spirit is an extended being (res extensa).\nIn Enchiridion metaphysicum, he argues that the properties of\nspace are analogous to the attributes of God (infinity, immateriality,\nimmobility etc.). \nWithin the category of spiritual substance More includes not just the\nsouls of living creatures and God himself but the main intermediate\ncausal agent of the cosmos, the Spirit of Nature (or ‘Hylarchic\nPrinciple’). Conceived as the interface between the divine and\nthe material, the Spirit of Nature is a ‘Superintendant\nCause’ which combines efficient and teleological causality to\nensure the smooth-running of the universe according to God’s plan.\nIt can also be understood as encapsulating ‘certain general\nModes and Lawes of Nature’ (More, A Collection,\nPreface, p. xvi) since it is the Spirit of Nature that is responsible\nfor uniting individual souls with bodies, and for ensuring the regular\noperation of non-animate nature. More sought, by this hypothesis, to\naccount for phenomena that apparently defy the laws of mechanical\nphysics (for example the inter-vortical trajectory of comets, the\nsympathetic vibration of strings and tidal motion). More underpinned\nhis soul-body dualism by his theory of ‘vital congruity’\nwhich explains soul-body interaction as a sympathetic attraction\nbetween soul and body engineered by the operation the Spirit of\nNature. \nThe most consistent theme of his philosophical writings, are arguments\nfor demonstrating the existence and providential nature of God. The\nfoundation stone of More’s philosophical and apologetic\nenterprise is his philosophy of spirit, especially his arguments for\nthe existence of incorporeal causal agents, that is, souls or spirits.\nFurthermore, More attempted to answer materialists like Thomas Hobbes\nwhom he regarded as an atheist. More’s strategy was to show that\nthe same arguments that materialists use demonstrate the existence and\nproperties of body, also support the obverse, the existence of\nincorporeal substances. In this way More sought to demonstrate that\nthe idea of incorporeal substance, or spirit, was as\nintelligible as that of corporeal substance, i.e. body. Like Plato (in\nLaws 10), More argues that the operations of the nature\ncannot be explained simply in terms of the chance collision of\nmaterial particles. Rather we must posit some other source of\nactivity, which More identifies as ‘spirit’. It is a short\nstep, he argues, from grasping the concept of spirit, to accepting the\nidea of an infinite spirit, namely God. \nMore underpins these a priori arguments for the existence of\nspirit, with a wide range of a posteriori arguments, taken\nfrom observed phenomena of nature to demonstrate the actions of\nspirit. Through this excursus into observational method he accumulated\na wide variety of data ranging from experiments conducted by Robert\nBoyle and members of the Royal Society, to supernatural effects\nincluding cases of witchcraft and demons. He was censured by Boyle for\nmisappropriating his experiments to endorse his hypothesis of the\nSpirit of Nature. Although his belief in evil spirits appears\ninconsistent with his otherwise rational philosophy, it should be\nremembered that belief in witchcraft was (a) not unusual in his time,\nand (b) was entirely consistent with the theory of spirit according to\nwhich to deny the existence of spirits good or evil, leads, logically\nto the denial of the existence of God. As he put it, alluding to James\nI’s defence of episcopacy, “That saying is no less true in\nPoliticks ‘No Bishop, no King,’ than this in Metaphysicks,\n‘No Spirit, no God’ ” (More, 1662,\nAntidote, p. 142). His most well-known fellow-believer was\nRoyal Society member, Joseph Glanvill (1636–1680), whose\nSadducismus triumphatus, More edited. \nMore also published a short treatise on ethics entitled\nEnchiridion Ethicum (1667, translated as An Account of\nVirtue), which was probably intended for to be used as a\ntextbook. Indebted to Descartes’ theory of the passions this\nargues that knowledge of virtue is attainable by reason, and the\npursuit of virtue entails the control of the passions by the soul.\nMotivation to good is supplied by rightly-directed emotion, while\nvirtue is achieved by the exercise free will or autoexousy\n(More uses the same term as Cudworth), that is the ‘Power to act\nor not act within ourselves’. Anticipating Shaftesbury’s\nconcept of moral sense More posits a special faculty of the soul\ncombining reason and sensation which he calls the ‘Boniform\nFaculty’. \nMore used a number of different genres for conveying his philosophical\nideas to non-specialist readers. The most popular among these were his\nPhilosophical Poems (1647) and his Divine Dialogues\n(1668). In Conjectura cabbalistica (1653), he presented core\nthemes of his philosophy in the form of an exposition of occulted\ntruths contained in the first book of Genesis. Subsequently he\nundertook a detailed study of the Jewish Kabbalist texts translated\nand published by Knorr von Rosenroth in Kabbala denudata\n(1679). These studies were based on the belief, then current, that\nkabbalistic writings contained, in symbolic form, original truths of\nphilosophy, as well as of religion. Kabbalism therefore exemplified\nthe compatibility of philosophy and faith. In addition to philosophy\nMore published several studies of biblical prophecy (e.g.\nApocalypsis apocalypseos, 1680, Paralipomena\nprophetica, 1685). In 1675, More prepared a Latin translation of\nhis works, Opera omnia which ensured his philosophy reached a\nEuropean audience as well as an English one. \nLike his friend Henry More, Ralph Cudworth spent his entire career as\na teacher at the University of Cambridge, ending up as Master of Clare\nCollege. Cudworth published only one major work of philosophy in his\nlifetime, The True Intellectual System of the Universe\n(1678). Among the papers he left at his death, were the treatises\npublished posthumously as A Treatise Concerning Eternal and\nImmutable Morality (1731) and his A Treatise of Freewill\n(1848). These papers also included two further manuscript treatises on\nthe topic of ‘Liberty and Necessity’, which have never\nbeen printed. \nCudworth’s True Intellectual System propounds an\nanti-determinist system of philosophy grounded in his conception of\nGod as a fully perfect being, infinitely wise and good. The created\nworld reflects the perfection, wisdom and goodness of its creator. It\nmust, therefore be orderly, intelligible, and organised for the best.\nThis anti-voluntarist understanding of God’s attributes is also\nthe foundation of epistemology and ethics, since God’s wisdom\nand goodness are the guarantors of truth and of moral principles. By\ncontrast, a philosophy founded on a voluntaristic conception of the\ndeity would have no ground of certainty or of morality because it\nwould depend on the arbitrary will of God who could, by arbitrary\nfiat, decree non-sense to be true and wrong to be right. It follows\nthat misconceptions of God’s attributes, which emphasise his\npower and will, result by definition in false philosopical systems\nwith sceptical and atheistic implications. \nMuch of The True Intellectual System amounts to an extended\nconsensus gentium argument for belief in God, demonstrable\nfrom an analysis of ancient sources which showed that most ancient\nphilosophers were theists, and therefore that theism is compatible\nwith philosophy. Among the non-theists, Cudworth (1678, p. 165)\nidentifies four schools of atheistic philosophy, each of which is a\ntype of materialism: Hylopathian atheism or materialism,\n‘Atomical or Democritical’ atheism, Cosmo-plastic atheism\n(which makes the world-soul the highest numen), and Hylozoic atheism\n(which attributes life to matter). Each of these ancient brands of\natheism has its latter-day manifestations in philosophers such as\nHobbes (an example of a Hylopathian atheist) and Spinoza (a latter-day\nHylozoist). \nThe philosophy constitutive of Cudworth’s intellectual system\ncombines atomist natural philosophy with Platonic metaphysics.\nCudworth conceives this as having originated with Moses from whom it\nwas transmitted via Pythagoras to Greek and other philosophers,\nincluding Descartes whom Cudworth regarded as a reviver of Mosaic\natomism. For Cudworth, as for Plato, soul is ontologically prior to\nthe physical world. Since motion, life, thought and action cannot be\nexplained in terms of material particles, haphazardly jolted together,\nthere must be some guiding originator, namely soul or spirit. In order\nto account for movement, life and orderliness in the operations of\nnature, Cudworth proposed his hypothesis of ‘the Plastick Life\nof Nature’. Similar in conception to More’s Spirit of Nature,\nCudworth’s Plastic Nature is a formative principle which acts as an\nintermediary between the divine and the natural world, as the means\nwhereby God imprints His presence on his creation and makes His wisdom\nand goodness manifest (and therefore intelligible) throughout created\nnature. \nThe Platonist principle that mind precedes the world lies at the\nfoundation of Cudworth’s epistemology which is discussed in\nA Treatise of Eternal and Immutable Morality. This is the\nmost fully developed theory of knowledge by any of the Cambridge\nPlatonists, and the most extensive treatment of innatism by any\nseventeenth-century philosopher. For Cudworth, as for Plato, ideas and\nmoral principles ‘are eternal and self-subsistent things’.\nThe external world is, intrinsically, intelligible, since it bears the\nimprint of its creator in the order and relationship of its component\nparts, as archetype to ectype. Cognition depends on the same\nprinciples, for just as the created world is a copy of the divine\narchetype, so also human minds contain the imprint of Divine wisdom\nand knowledge. Since the human mind mirrors the mind of God, it is\nready furnished with ideas and the ability to reason. Cognition\ntherefore entails recollection and the ideas of things with which the\nmind thinks are therefore ‘anticipations’– for which\nCudworth adopts the Stoic term prolepsis. Cognition is not a\npassive process, but involves the active participation of the mind.\nAlthough innate knowledge is the only true knowledge, Cudworth does\nnot reject sense knowledge because sensory input is essential for\nknowledge of the body and the external world. However, raw sense data\nis not, by itself, knowledge since it requires mental processing in\norder to become knowledge. As Cudworth puts it, we cannot understand\nthe book of nature unless we know how to read. \nCudworth’s theory of the mind as active is matched by an\nanti-determinist ethics of action, according to which the soul freely\ndirects itself towards the good. In A Treatise Cudworth\nargues not only that ideas exist independently of human minds, but\nalso the principles of morality are eternal and immutable. In a\nconcerted attack on Hobbesian moral relativism, Cudworth, argues that\nthe criteria of right and wrong, good and evil, justice and injustice\nare not a matter of convention, but are founded in the goodness and\njustice of God. Like Plato in the Euthyphro, Cudworth argues\nthat it is not God’s will that determines goodness, but that God\nwills things because they are good. The exercise of virtue is not,\nhowever, a passive process, but requires the free exercise of the\nindividual will. Cudworth sets out his theory of free will in three\ntreatises on ‘Liberty and Necessity’, only one of which\nhas been published, and that posthumously – A Treatise of\nFreewill (1848). According to Cudworth, the will is not a faculty\nof the soul, distinct from reason, but a power of the soul which\ncombines the functions of both reason and will in order to direct the\nsoul towards the good. Cudworth’s use of the terms\n‘hegemonikon’ (taken from Stoicism) and\n‘autexousion’ (taken from Plotinus) underlines the fact\nthat the exercise of will entails the power to act. It is internal\ndirection, not external compulsion that induces us to act either\nmorally or immorally. Without the freedom (and therefore power) to of\nact, there would be no moral responsibility. Moral conduct is active,\nnot passive. Virtuous action is therefore a matter of active internal\nself-determination, rather than determination from without. \nIn A Treatise of Freewill, Cudworth elaborates his conception\nof the hegemonikon, an integrative power of the soul, which\ncombines the the higher intellectual functions of the soul, will and\nreason with the lower, animal, appetites of the soul. Furthermore,\nCudworth conceives of the hegemonikon not simply as the soul\nbut the whole person, ‘that which is properly we\nourselves’ (Cudworth, 1996, p. 178). Cudworth’s concept of\nhegemonikon lays the basis for a concept of self identity\nfounded in a subject that is at once thinking, autonomous and\nend-directed. Cudworth did not (as far as is known) develop a\npolitical philosophy. However, the political implications of his\nethical theory set him against Hobbes, but also, in many ways\nanticipate John Locke. \nAmong the immediate philosophical heirs of the Cambridge Platonists,\nmention should be made of Henry More’s pupil, Anne Conway\n(1631–1679), one of the very few female philosophers of the\nperiod. Her Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern\nPhilosophy (1692) includes a critique of More’s dualistic\nphilosophy of spirit, proposing instead a metaphysical monism that\nanticipates Leibniz. Another figure linked to More was John Norris\n(1657–1712) who was to become the leading English exponent of\nthe philosophy of Malebranche. Whichcote’s philosophical wisdom was\nadmired by Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury who\npublished his Select Sermons in 1698. Shaftesbury’s tutor,\nJohn Locke was the intimate friend of Cudworth’s philosophical\ndaughter, Damaris Masham.  \nThe Cambridge Platonists have yet to receive full recognition as\nphilosophers. Evidence from publication and citation suggests that\ntheir philosophical influence was more far-reaching than is normally\nrecognised in modern histories of philosophy. Culverwell’s\nDiscourse was reprinted four times, including at Oxford. The\nimpact of Cudworth on Locke has yet to be fully investigated. Richard\nPrice, and Thomas Reid were both indebted to Cudworth. As the first\nphilosophers to write primarily and consistently in the English\nlanguage (preceded only by Sir Kenelm Digby), their impact is still\nfelt in English philosophical terminology, through their coinage of\nsuch familiar terms as ‘materialism‘,\n‘consciousness‘, and ‘Cartesianism‘. \nThe intellectual legacy of the Cambridge Platonists extends not just\nto philosophical debate in seventeenth-century England and to Scottish\nEnlightenment thought, but into the European Enlightenment and beyond.\nLeibniz certainly read Cudworth and More, whose works were known\nbeyond the English-speaking world thanks to Latin translations\nMore’s Opera omnia appeared in 1675–9, and Cudworth’s\nentire printed works were translated into Latin by Johann Lorenz\nMosheim and published in Jena in 1733. Cudworth’s theory of Plastic\nNature was taken up in vitalist debates in the French enlightenment.\nAlthough their critique of Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza has ensured that\nthe Cambridge Platonists are never completely ignored in philosophical\nhistory, they deserve to be considered an important strand in English\nseventeenth-century philosophy.
