Kant held that every rational being had both an innate\nright to freedom and a duty to enter into a civil condition governed\nby a social contract in order to realize and preserve that\nfreedom.\n\n\nHis writings on political philosophy consist of one book and several\nshorter works. The “Doctrine of Right”, Part One of his\ntwo-part Metaphysics of Morals and first published as a\nstand-alone book in February 1797, contains virtually every directly\npolitical topic he treats. Other shorter works include a useful short\nsummary of his discussion of the basis and role of the state in the\nsecond section of the essay “Theory and Practice”, an\nextended discussion of international relations in the essay\n“Toward Perpetual Peace”, and the essay “An Answer\nto the Question: What is Enlightenment?.” Other published\nmaterial relevant to the topics include material on history, on\npractical philosophy in general, and, for his social philosophy, his\nwork on religion, education, and anthropology. Kant also offered a\nbiannual lecture course on “Natural Right”, a student’s\n(Feyerabend) transcript of which is available in English\ntranslation.\n\nKant’s political philosophy is a branch of practical philosophy,\none-half of one of the broadest divisions in Kant’s thought between\npractical and theoretical philosophy. Political philosophy is also to\nbe distinguished within practical philosophy from both empirical\nelements and from virtue proper. The separation from virtue is treated\nlater in this section. Regarding the empirical elements, it is worth\nmentioning that practical philosophy, as a set of rules governing free\nbehavior of rational beings, covers all human action in both its pure\nand applied (empirical, or “impure”) aspects. Pure\npractical philosophy, the rational elements of practical philosophy in\nabstraction from anything empirical, is called by Kant\n“metaphysics of morals” (4:388). Kant so emphasized the\npriority of the pure aspect of political philosophy that he wrote part\nof his essay “On the Common Saying: That May be Correct in\nTheory, but it is of No Use in Practice” in opposition to the\nview he associates with Hobbes that the politician need not be\nconcerned with abstract right but only with pragmatic governance\n(8:289–306). Yet Kant also included the more pragmatic, impure,\nempirical study of human behavior as part of practical philosophy. For\nethics in general, Kant called the empirical study of human beings as\nagents within particular cultures and with particular natural\ncapacities “anthropology”. Some of Kant’s social\nphilosophy fits into this rubric (see section 10).  \nPolitical philosophy is not only a branch of Kant’s practical\nphilosophy, it strongly depends upon Kant’s core practical philosophy\nfor its basis. Kant’s practical philosophy and the categorical\nimperative that governs it were intended to form the ground not only\nfor what is thought today to be ethics proper but also for everything\nthat broadly speaking had to do with deliberative human behavior. He\ndefined practical philosophy as that concerned with “rules of\nbehavior in regard to free choice”, as opposed to theoretical\nphilosophy that concerned “the rule of knowledge” (Kant\n27: 243). Practical philosophy provided rules to govern human\ndeliberative action. The Groundwork for the Metaphysics of\nMorals provided Kant’s main arguments that the categorical\nimperative is the supreme rule for human deliberative action. In its\nPreface, he notes that the Groundwork is to be a preparatory\nbook for a future Metaphysics of Morals. Twelve years later\nhe published that Metaphysics of Morals in two parts, the\n“Doctrine of Right” and the “Doctrine of\nVirtue”. Both are equally parts of Kant’s practical philosophy,\nand both thus have the categorical imperative as their highest\nprinciple. \nThe book Metaphysics of Morals has two distinct parts: the\n“Doctrine of Right” and the “Doctrine of\nVirtue”. Kant sought to separate political rights and duties\nfrom what we might call morals in the narrow sense. He limits right by\nstating three conditions (6:230) that have to be met for something to\nbe enforceable as right: first, right concerns only actions that have\ninfluence on other persons, directly or indirectly, meaning duties to\nthe self are excluded, second right does not concern the wish but only\nthe choice of others, meaning that not mere desires but only decisions\nwhich bring about actions are at stake, and third right does not\nconcern the matter of the other’s act but only the form, meaning no\nparticular desires or ends are assumed on the part of the agents. As\nan example of the latter he considers trade, which for right must have\nthe form of being freely agreed by both parties but can have any\nmatter or purpose the agents want. These criteria appear to be less\nrigid than Kant ultimately intends, for the term\n“influence” is vague enough that it might include\nfar-reaching minor effects. They would also include under right\nactions even those imperfect duties that “influence”\nothers by improving their lot, such as beneficent acts of charity.\nJohn Stuart Mill’s “harm principle” does not face this\nproblem since it specifies that the influence to be subject to law is\nalways negative. While Kant must include consideration of beneficent\naction as part of right, he does not conclude that beneficent actions\nare required by right but only that most are permitted by right and\nothers violate right. His focus on free individual choice entails that\nany beneficent action that interferes with or usurps the recipient’s\nfree choice is wrong (for example, improving the recipient’s property\nwithout permission as opposed to merely donating money to a fund made\navailable to the recipient at the recipient’s discretion). \nIn addition to these three conditions for right, Kant also offers\ndirect contrasts between right and virtue. He thinks both relate to\nfreedom but in different ways: right concerns outer freedom and virtue\nconcerns inner freedom (being master of one’s own passions)\n(6:406–07). Right concerns acts themselves independent of the\nmotive an agent may have for performing them, virtue concerns the\nproper motive for dutiful actions (6:218–221). In another\nformulation (6:380–81) he says that right concerns universality\nas a formal condition of freedom while virtue concerns a necessary end\nbeyond the mere formality of universality, thus appearing to tie the\ndistinction to the first two formulas of the categorical imperative in\nthe Groundwork. In yet another he says that right concerns\nnarrow duties and virtue wide duties (6:390). In the Feyerabend\nlectures, Kant notes that right is the subset of morally correct\nactions that are also coercible (27:1327). These various alternative\nformulations of the distinction would exclude imperfect duties not\nbecause imperfect duties do not “influence” others (they\ndo) but because, as imperfect, they cannot be coerced in particular\ninstances, since imperfect duties always allow for the moderating role\nof an individual’s inclinations. While these various formulations of\nthe distinction appear to be quite different, they can in general be\nsummarized by saying that right concerns outer action corresponding to\nperfect duty that affects others regardless of the individual’s\ninternal motivations or goals. \n“There is only one innate right,” says Kant,\n“Freedom (independence from being constrained by another’s\nchoice), insofar as it can coexist with the freedom of every other in\naccordance with a universal law” (6:237). Kant rejects any other\nbasis for the state, in particular arguing that the welfare of\ncitizens cannot be the basis of state power. He argues that a state\ncannot legitimately impose any particular conception of happiness upon\nits citizens (8:290–91). To do so would be for the ruler to\ntreat citizens as children, assuming that they are unable to\nunderstand what is truly useful or harmful to themselves.  \nThis claim must be understood in light of Kant’s more general claim\nthat moral law cannot be based upon happiness or any other given\nempirical good. In the Groundwork Kant contrasts an ethics of\nautonomy, in which the will (Wille, or practical reason\nitself) is the basis of its own law, from the ethics of heteronomy, in\nwhich something independent of the will, such as happiness, is the\nbasis of moral law (4:440–41). In the Critique of Practical\nReason he argues that happiness (the agreeableness of life when\nthings go in accordance with one’s wishes and desires), although\nuniversally sought by human beings, is not specific enough to entail\nany particular universal desires in human beings. Further, even were\nthere any universal desires among human beings, those desires would,\nas empirical, be merely contingent and thus unworthy of being the\nbasis of any pure moral law (5:25–26). No particular conception\nof happiness can be the basis of the pure principle of the state, and\nthe general conception of happiness is too vague to serve as the basis\nof a law. Hence, a “universal principle of right” cannot\nbe based upon happiness but only on something truly universal, such as\nfreedom. The “universal principle of right” Kant offers is\nthus “Any action is right if it can coexist with everyone’s\nfreedom in accordance with a universal law, or if on its maxim the\nfreedom of choice of each can coexist with everyone’s freedom in\naccordance with a universal law” (6:230).  \nThis explains why happiness is not universal, but not why freedom is\nuniversal. By “freedom” in political philosophy, Kant is\nnot referring to the transcendental conception of freedom usually\nassociated with the problem of the freedom of the will amid\ndeterminism in accordance with laws of nature, a solution to which is\nprovided in the Third Antinomy of the Critique of Pure\nReason. Rather, freedom in political philosophy is defined, as in\nthe claim above about the only innate right, as “independence\nfrom being constrained by another’s choice”. His concern in\npolitical philosophy is not with laws of nature determining a\nhuman being’s choice but by other human beings determining a\nhuman being’s choice, hence the kind of freedom Kant is concerned with\nin political philosophy is individual freedom of action. Still, the\nuniversality of political freedom is linked to transcendental freedom.\nKant assumes that a human being’s use of choice (at least when it is\nproperly guided by reason) is free in the transcendental sense. Since\nevery human being does enjoy transcendental freedom by virtue of being\nrational, freedom of choice is a universal human attribute. And this\nfreedom of choice is to be respected and promoted, even when this\nchoice is not exercised in rational or virtuous activity. Presumably\nrespecting freedom of choice involves allowing it to be effective in\ndetermining actions; this is why Kant calls political freedom, or\n“independence from being constrained by another’s choice”,\nthe only innate right. One might still object that this freedom of\nchoice is incapable of being the basis of a pure principle of right\nfor the same reason that happiness was incapable of being its basis,\nnamely, that it is too vague in itself and that when specified by the\nparticular decisions individuals make with their free choice, it loses\nits universality. Kant holds that this problem does not arise for\nfreedom, since freedom of choice can be understood both in terms of\nits content (the particular decisions individuals make) and its form\n(the free, unconstrained nature of choice of any possible particular\nend) (6:230). Freedom is universal in the proper sense because, unlike\nhappiness, it can be understood in such a way that it is susceptible\nto specification without losing its universality. Right will be based\non the form of free choice.  \nThe very existence of a state might seem to some as a limitation of\nfreedom, since a state possesses power to control the external freedom\nof individual citizens through force. This is the basic claim of\nanarchism. Kant holds in contrast that the state is not an impediment\nto freedom but is the means for freedom. State action that is a\nhindrance to freedom can, when properly directed, support and maintain\nfreedom if the state action is aimed at hindering actions that\nthemselves would hinder the freedom of others. Given a subject’s\naction that would limit the freedom of another subject, the state may\nhinder the first subject to defend the second by “hindering a\nhindrance to freedom”. Such state coercion is compatible with\nthe maximal freedom demanded in the principle of right because it does\nnot reduce freedom but instead provides the necessary background\nconditions needed to secure freedom. The amount of freedom lost by the\nfirst subject through direct state coercion is equal to the amount\ngained by the second subject through lifting the hindrance to actions.\nState action sustains the maximal amount of freedom consistent with\nidentical freedom for all without reducing it.  \nFreedom is not the only basis for principles underlying the state. In\n“Theory and Practice” Kant makes freedom the first of\nthree principles (8:290): \nFreedom as discussed in “Theory and Practice” stresses the\nautonomous right of all individuals to conceive of happiness in their\nown way. Interference with another’s freedom is understood as coercing\nthe other to be happy as the former sees fit. The direct link to\naction comes when pursuing that autonomously chosen conception of\nhappiness. Each may pursue happiness as they see fit provided that\ntheir pursuit does not infringe upon others’ similar pursuits. \nEquality is not substantive but formal. Each member of the state is\nequal to every other member of the state before the law. Each has\nequal coercive right, that is, the right to invoke the power of the\nstate to enforce the laws on one’s behalf. (Kant exempts the head of\nstate from this equality, since the head of state cannot be coerced by\nanyone else). This formal equality is perfectly compatible with the\ninequality of members of the state in income, physical power, mental\nability, possessions, etc. Further, this equality supports an equality\nof opportunity: every office or rank in the political structure must\nbe open to all subjects without regard for any hereditary or similar\nrestrictions.  \nIndependence concerns citizens as subject to laws they give\nthemselves, i.e. as co-legislators of the laws. While this principle\nappears to require universal democratic decision making for particular\nlaws, Kant instead understands this principle on two levels, one of\nwhich is not universal and the other of which is not for particular\nlaws. At one level, that of participation in determination of\nparticular laws, citizenship does not extend to all. Kant excludes\nwomen and children, weakly claiming that their exclusion is natural,\nas well as anyone who lacks economic self-sufficiency. Hence decision\nmaking is not universal. While Kant thereby denies women and others\nfull citizenship in the ability to take part in legislation, he\nstresses that he is not denying them the rights entailed by freedom\nand equality as “passive” members of the state. At the\nsecond level, he claims that all members of the state, as subjects of\nthe law, must be able to will the basic law that governs them. This\nbasic law is the “original contract” and will be discussed\nin the next section. The basic law is willed by each subject in the\nsense that the “will of all” or a “public\nwill”, or “general will” (Kant uses Rousseau’s term)\ndetermines the basic law. Hence decision making at this level is not\nfor particular laws. Particular laws, in contrast, are to be\ndetermined by a majority of the citizens with voting rights, as will\nbe discussed in section 4.  \nKant provides two distinct discussions of social contract. One\nconcerns property and will be treated in more detail in section 5\nbelow. The second discussion of social contract comes in the essay\n“Theory and Practice” in the context of an a priori\nrestriction on the legitimate policies the sovereign may pursue. The\nsovereign must recognize the “original contract” as an\nidea of reason that forces the sovereign to “give his laws in\nsuch a way that they could have arisen from the united will of a whole\npeople and to regard each subject, insofar as he wants to be a\ncitizen, as if he has joined in voting for such a will” (8:297).\nThis original contract, Kant stresses, is only an idea of reason and\nnot a historical event. Any rights and duties stemming from an\noriginal contract do so not because of any particular historical\nprovenance, but because of the rightful relations embodied in the\noriginal contract. No empirical act, as a historical act would be,\ncould be the foundation of any rightful duties or rights. The idea of\nan original contract limits the sovereign as legislator. No law may be\npromulgated that “a whole people could not possibly give its\nconsent to” (8:297). The consent at issue, however, is also not\nan empirical consent based upon any actual act. The set of actual\nparticular desires of citizens is not the basis of determining whether\nthey could possibly consent to a law. Rather, the kind of possibility\nat issue is one of rational possible unanimity based upon fair\ndistributions of burdens and rights in abstraction from empirical\nfacts or desires. Kant’s two examples both exemplify this\nconsideration of possible rational unanimity. His first example is a\nlaw that would provide hereditary privileges to members of a certain\nclass of subjects. This law would be unjust because it would be\nirrational for those who would not be members of this class to agree\nto accept fewer privileges than members of the class. One might say\nthat no possible empirical information could cause all individuals to\nagree to this law. Kant’s second example concerns a war tax. If the\ntax is administered fairly, it would not be unjust. Kant adds that\neven if the actual citizens opposed the war, the war tax would be just\nbecause it is possible that the war is being waged for legitimate\nreasons that the state but not the citizens know about. Here possible\nempirical information might cause all citizens to approve the law. In\nboth these examples, the conception of “possible consent”\nabstracts from actual desires individual citizens have. The possible\nconsent is not based upon a hypothetical vote given actual preferences\nbut is based on a rational conception of agreement given any possible\nempirical information. \nKant’s view is similar to the social contract theory of Hobbes in a\nfew important respects. The social contract is not a historical\ndocument and does not involve a historical act. In fact it can be\ndangerous to the stability of the state to even search history for\nsuch empirical justification of state power (6:318). The current state\nmust be understood, regardless of its origin, to embody the social\ncontact. The social contract is a rational justification for state\npower, not a result of actual deal-making among individuals or between\nthem and a government. Another link to Hobbes is that the social\ncontract is not voluntary. Individuals may be forced into the civil\ncondition against their consent (6:256). Social contract is not based\non any actual consent such as a voluntary choice to form a civil\nsociety along with others. Since the social contract reflects reason,\neach human being as a rational being already contains the basis for\nrational agreement to the state. Are individuals then coerced to\nrecognize their subjection to state power against their will? Since\nKant defines “will” as “practical reason\nitself” (Groundwork, 4:412), the answer for him is\n“no.” If one defines “will” as arbitrary\nchoice, then the answer is “yes.” This is the same\ndichotomy that arises with regard to Kant’s theory of punishment\n(section 7). A substantial difference between Kant and Hobbes is that\nHobbes bases his argument on the individual benefit for each party to\nthe contract, whereas Kant bases his argument on Right itself,\nunderstood as freedom for all persons in general, not just for the\nindividual benefit that the parties to the contract obtain in their\nown particular freedom. To this extent Kant is influenced more by\nRousseau’s idea of the General Will.  \nKant was a central figure in the philosophy of the Enlightenment. One\nof his popular essays, “An Answer to the Question: What is\nEnlightenment?” discusses Enlightenment in terms of the use of\nan individual’s own reason (8:35f). To be Enlightened is to emerge\nfrom one’s self-incurred minority (juvenile) status to a mature\nability to think for oneself. In another essay, “What Does it\nMean to Orient Oneself in Thought?” Kant defines Enlightenment\nas “the maxim of always thinking for oneself” (8:146).\n“What is Enlightenment” distinguishes between the public\nand private uses of reason. The private use of reason is, for\ngovernment officials, the use of reason they must utilize in their\nofficial positions. For example, a member of the clergy (who in Kant’s\nPrussia were employees of the state) is required to espouse the\nofficial doctrine in sermons and teachings. The public use of reason\nis the use an individual makes of reason as a scholar reaching the\npublic world of readers. For example, the same member of the clergy\ncould, as a scholar, present perceived shortcomings in that very same\ndoctrine. Similarly, military officers can, using public reason,\nquestion the value or appropriateness of the orders they receive, but\nin their functions as military officers, using private reason, they\nare obliged to obey the same orders. Since the sovereign might err,\nand individual citizens have the right to attempt to correct the error\nunder the assumption that the sovereign does not intend to err:\n“a citizen must have, with the approval of the ruler himself,\nthe authorization to make known publicly his opinions about what it is\nin the ruler’s arrangements that seems to him to be a wrong against\nthe commonwealth,” writes Kant in “Theory and\nPractice”. This freedom of the pen is “the sole palladium” of\nthe rights of the people, for without this means the people would have\nno way to make any claims to rights at all (8:304). \nOne might expect from this emphasis that Kant would insist that the\nproper political system is one that not only allows individuals to\nthink for themselves about political issues, but also contains a\nmechanism such as voting to translate those well reasoned opinions\ninto government policy. One would be wrong. Kant does not stress\nself-government. In his discussion in “Perpetual Peace” of\nthe traditional division of the types of government Kant classifies\ngovernments in two dimensions (8:352). The first is the “form of\nsovereignty”, concerning who rules, and here Kant identifies the\ntraditional three forms: either rule by one person, rule by a small\ngroup of people, or rule by all people. The second is the “form\nof government” concerning how those people rule, and here Kant\noffers a variation on the traditional good/bad dichotomy: either\nrepublican or despotic. By “republican,” Kant means\n“separation of the executive power (the government) from the\nlegislative power”. Despotism is their unity such that the same\nruler both gives and enforces laws, in essence making an individual\nprivate will into the public will. Republics require representation in\norder to ensure that the executive power only enforces the public will\nby insisting that the executive enforce only laws that representatives\nof the people, not the executive itself, make. But a republic is\ncompatible with a single individual acting as legislator provided that\nothers act as executives; for example, a monarch would issue laws in\nthe name of the people’s will but the monarch’s ministers would\nenforce those laws. Kant’s claim that such a government is republican\n(see also 27:1384) showcases his view that a republican government\nneed not require actual participation of the people in making the\nlaws, even through elected representatives, as long as the laws are\npromulgated with the whole united will of the people in mind. Kant\ndoes, nonetheless, think that an elected representative legislator is\nthe best form of a republic (8:353). Whether elected or unelected, the\nmoral person who holds legislative power is representative of the\npeople united as a whole, and is thus sovereign. \nWhen Kant discusses voting for representatives, he adheres to many\nprevailing prejudices of the time (8:295). The right to vote requires\n“being one’s own master” and hence having property or some\nskill that can support one independently. The reason given for this,\nthat those who must acquire something from another to make a living\nalienate what belongs to them, is so vague that Kant himself admits in\na footnote “It is, I admit, somewhat difficult to determine what\nis required in order to be able to claim the rank of a human being who\nis his own master.” Kant also leaves women out of the voting\npopulations for what he calls “natural” reasons which are\nleft unspecified. \nKant’s state, then, does not require that actual decisions are made by\nthe people at large, even through elected representatives. He holds\nthat a single individual or small group can themselves adequately\nrepresent the people at large simply by adopting the point of view of\nthe people. Insistence on a representative system (8:353) is not\ninsistence on an elected representative system. Nonetheless\nit is clear that Kant holds that such an elective representative\nsystem is ideal. Republican constitutions, he claims, are prone to\navoid war because, when the consent of the people is needed, they will\nconsider the costs they must endure in a war (fighting, taxes,\ndestruction of property, etc), whereas a non-republican ruler may be\ninsulated from such concerns. In the “Doctrine of Right”\nhe also notes that a republican system not only represents the people\nbut does so “by all the citizens united and acting through their\ndelegates” (6:342).  \nThe “Doctrine of Right” begins with a discussion of\nproperty, showing the importance of this right for the implementation\nof the innate right to freedom. Property is defined as that\n“with which I am so connected that another’s use of it without\nmy consent would wrong me” (6:245). In one sense, if I am\nholding an object such as an apple, and another snatches it from my\nhand, I have been wronged because in taking the object from my\nphysical possession, the other harms me (Kant does not specify whether\nthis harm is because one’s current use of the apple is terminated or\nbecause one’s body is affected, but the latter fits the argument\nbetter). Kant calls this “physical” or\n“sensible” possession. It is not a sufficient sense of\npossession to count as rightful possession of an object. Rightful\npossession must be possession of an object so that another’s use of\nthe object without my consent harms me even when I am not physically\naffected and not currently using the object. If someone plucks an\napple from my tree, no matter where I am and no matter whether I am\neven aware of the loss I am prevented from using that apple. Kant\ncalls this “intelligible possession”.  \nHis proof that there must be this intelligible possession and not\nmerely physical possession turns on the application of human choice\n(6:246). An object of choice is one that some human has the capacity\nto use as means for various ends or purposes. Rightful possession\nwould be the right to make use of such an object. Suppose that for\nsome particular object, no one has rightful possession. This would\nmean that a usable object would be beyond possible use. Kant grants\nthat such a condition does not contradict the principle of right\nbecause it is compatible with everyone’s freedom in accordance with\nuniversal law. But putting an object beyond rightful use when humans\nhave the capacity to use it would “annihilate” the object\nin a practical respect, treat it as nothing. Kant claims that this is\nproblematic because in a practical respect an object is considered\nmerely as an object of possible choice. This consideration of the mere\nform alone, the object simply as an object of choice, cannot contain\nany prohibition of use for an object, for any such prohibition would\nbe freedom limiting itself for no reason. Thus in a practical respect\nan object cannot be treated as nothing, and so the object must be\nconsidered as at least potentially in rightful possession of some\nhuman being or other. So all objects within human capacity for use\nmust be subject to rightful or intelligible possession.  \nIntelligible possession, then, is required by right in order for free\nbeings to be able to realize their freedom by using objects for their\nfreely chosen purposes. This conclusion entails the existence of\nprivate property but not any particular distribution of private\nproperty. All objects must be considered as potential property of some\nhuman being or other. Now if one human being is to have intelligible\npossession of a particular object, all other human beings must refrain\nfrom using that object. Such a one-sided relation would violate the\nuniversality of external right. Kant further worries that any\nunilateral declaration by one person that an object belongs to that\nperson alone would infringe on the freedom of others. The only way\nthat intelligible possession is possible without violating the\nprinciple of right is if there is an agreement that puts all under an\nobligation to recognize each other’s intelligible possessions. Each\nperson must acknowledge an obligation to refrain from using objects\nthat belong to another. Since no individual will can rightfully make\nand enforce such a law obligating everyone to respect others’\nproperty, this mutual obligation is possible only in accordance with a\n“collective general (common) and powerful will”, in other\nwords, only in a civil condition. The state itself obligates all\ncitizens to respect the property of other citizens. The state\nfunctions as an objective, disinterested institution that resolves\ndisputes about individual property and enforces compliance with those\ndeterminations. Without a state to enforce these property rights, they\nare impossible. \nThis creation of a civil condition is Kant’s first manner of\ndiscussing a social contract mentioned in section 3. Prior to a social\ncontract the only manner in which human beings can control things is\nthrough empirical possession, actual occupation and use of land and\nobjects. In order to gain full property rights to land and objects,\nindividuals must all agree to respect the property rights of others in\na social contract. They are in fact required, as a duty, to enter into\na social condition in order to defend their own and everyone’s\nproperty rights. Only in such a society can persons exercise their\nfreedom, that is their pursuit of ends, by legitimately using objects\nfor their own purposes without regard for others. Hence a social\ncontract is the rational justification of the state because state\npower is necessary for each individual to be guaranteed access to some\nproperty in order to realize their freedom. While the discussion in\n“Theory and Practice” of a social contract as an idea of\nreason constrains the sovereign in promulgating laws, it does not\nexplain why the state is necessary in the first place. The discussion\nin “Doctrine of Right” of property as the basis of a\nsocial contract explains why individuals are in fact rationally\nrequired to enter into a social contract.  \nA puzzle arises here with regard to property. If individuals are not\nable to have any intelligible property prior to the existence of a\nstate, yet the state’s role is to enforce property rights, where does\nthe original assignment of property to individuals occur? John Locke\nhad famously avoided this problem in his theory of property by making\nproperty a product of a single individual’s activity. By\n“mixing” one’s labor with an object in the commons, one\ncomes to have property in the object. Kant objects to Locke’s theory\nof property on the grounds that it makes property a relation between a\nperson and a thing rather than between the wills of several persons\n(6:268–69). Since property is a relation of wills that can occur\nonly in a civil condition under a common sovereign power, Kant\nsuggests that prior to this civil condition property can be acquired\nonly in anticipation of and in conformity with a civil condition.\nProvisional property is initial physical appropriation of objects with\nthe intention of making them rightful property in a state (6:264,\n267).  \nProperty is of three types for Kant (6:247–48, 260). First is\nthe right to a thing, to corporeal objects in space. Examples of these\nthings include land, animals, and tools. The second is the right\nagainst a person, the right to coerce that person to perform an\naction. This is contract right. The third is the “right to a\nperson akin to a right to a thing”, the most controversial of\nKant’s categories in which he includes spouses, children, and\nservants. Of these three types, the first has already been discussed\nin relation to acquisition. The second of these, contract right,\ninvolves the possession by one person of the “deed” of\nanother (6:274). One person is able to control the choice of another\nin order to apply the other’s causal powers to some end. At first\nglance this contract right appears to violate the second formula of\nthe categorical imperative which states that persons are to be treated\nalways as ends and never merely as means. A contract appears to be a\ncase in which an individual is used merely as a means. A homeowner,\nfor example, hires a repair specialist specifically as a means for\nrepairing a house. Kant turns the tables on this problem by showing\nthat a contract is “the united choice of two persons” and\nthus treats both parties to the contract as ends. For example, he\nnotes that the repair specialist who is contracted to work on a house\nhas agreed to the exchange in order to obtain a personal end, namely,\nmoney (27:1319). Each party to the contract is both means for the\nother and an end.  \nThe third category, the right to a person akin to a thing, is Kant’s\nown addition to the traditional understanding of property and\ncontract. Kant argues that some contracts or rightful obligations such\nas the parent-child relation allow one party to the contract to\ncontrol not only the choice of the other, but also to possess some\npower over the body of the other, such as the power to insist that the\nother remain in the household. His discussion of marriage, which\nfocuses on this legal relation in abstraction from empirical\nconsiderations such as love, treats marriage as reciprocal access to\nthe other’s sexual organs. While each partner in the marriage is using\nthe other as a means for enjoyment and thus as a thing, the marriage\ncontract’s reciprocity “restores” their personality as\nends in themselves (6:278). Kant describes this legal relation as\nequal in these powers of possession and in the communal property. Both\nmen and women must have reciprocal relations of this kind; for\nexample, a wife may utilize state power to insist that a runaway\nhusband perform his family duties of child support; likewise, a man’s\nuse of a prostitute as a thing violates her dignity as an end in\nherself (only the latter is Kant’s example). Despite this equality at\nthe level of a priori right, Kant holds that men have a natural\nsuperiority in their capacity to promote the couple’s common interest,\nand that laws codifying husbands’s rule over wives are not unjust.\nCertainly Kant’s personal sexism plays a part in his views on\nmarriage, as it did in his exclusion of women from voting. Some of\nKant’s own contemporaries objected to his views on women, and an early\nreview of the “Doctrine of Right” rejecting Kant’s novel\ncategory of property to persons akin to things prompted him to respond\nin an Appendix to the book’s second edition.  \nThe very idea of a right to rebel against the government is\nincoherent, Kant argued, because the embodiment of all right is the\nactually existing state. By this he did not mean that any actually\nexisting state is always completely just, or that merely by virtue of\nhaving power, the state could determine what justice is. He meant that\na rightful condition, the opposite of the state of nature, is possible\nonly when there is some means for individuals to be governed by the\n“general legislative will” (6:320). Any state embodies the\ngeneral legislative will better than no state. While such reasoning\nseems pragmatic, it is not. It is instead based upon the claims above\nthat a rightful condition requires the centralizing of coercive power\nin a state as the only means of bringing about reciprocal coercion and\nobligation. Kant also argues that a right to rebel would require that\na people be authorized to resist the state. This kind of authorization\nfor action, however, is an exercise of sovereign power, and to any\npeople who claimed such a right would be claiming it (the people)\nrather than the state embodies sovereign power. It would thus\n“make the people, as subject, by one and the same judgment\nsovereign over him to whom it is subject” (6:320). This is a\ncontradiction. The nature of sovereignty is such that sovereign power\ncannot be shared. Were it shared between the state and the people,\nthen when a dispute arose between them, who would judge whether the\nstate or the people are correct? There being no higher sovereign power\nto make such a judgment, all other means for resolving the dispute\nfall outside of rightful relations. This role of judgment relates to\nthe judgment that Kant discusses with regard to the social contract.\nUnder the idea of a social contract, the sovereign legislator may not\nmake a law that the people could not make for itself because it\npossesses irrational, non-universal form. The state, not the people,\nis the judge of when a law is rational (8:297). People who argue for a\nright to revolution, Kant claims, misunderstand the nature of a social\ncontract. They claim that the social contract must have been an actual\nhistorical occurrence from which the people could withdraw\n(8:301–02). But since the social contact is only an idea of\nreason which sets moral limits to the sovereign’s legislative acts,\nand the sovereign’s judgment alone determines how these limits are to\nbe interpreted, there is no independent contractual agreement to which\nthe people could refer in its complaints. Citizens are still allowed\nto voice their grievances through their use of public reason, but they\ncan do nothing more than attempt to persuade the sovereign to adopt or\nrepeal decisions.  \nWhile the people cannot rebel against the state, Kant does not insist\nthat citizens always obey the state. He allows at least for passive\ncivil disobedience. This comes in two forms: in a republican\nrepresentative system such as England’s, there can be “a\nnegative resistance, that is, a refusal of the people (in parliament)\nto accede to every demand the government puts forth as necessary for\nadministering the state” (6:322). In the context of this\ndiscussion it is clear that Kant is referring to the use of the power\nof the legislature to refuse funding, and therefore approval, of\nactions of the executive. He clarifies that the legislature is not\nallowed to dictate any positive action to the executive, its\nlegitimate resistance is only negative. A second form of acceptable\nresistance applies to individuals. Kant mentions that citizens are\nobligated to obey the sovereign “in whatever does not conflict\nwith inner morality” (6:371). He does not elaborate on the term\n“inner morality”.  \nNor does Kant always reject the actions of revolutionaries. If a\nrevolution is successful, citizens have as much obligation to obey the\nnew regime as they had to obey the old one (6:323). Since the new\nregime is in fact a state authority, it now possesses the right to\nrule. Further, in his theory of history, Kant argues that progress in\nthe long run will come about in part through violent and unjust\nactions such as wars. Kant even takes it as a sign of progress that\nspectators of the French Revolution had greeted it with “a\nwishful participation that borders closely on enthusiasm”\n(7:85). Kant is not pointing to the revolution itself as a sign of\nprogress but to the reaction of people such as himself to news of the\nrevolution. The spectators endorse the revolution not because it is\nlegitimate but because it is aimed at the creation of a civil\nconstitution. Revolution, then, is wrong but still contributes to\nprogress.  \nIn fact, Kant did believe that the French Revolution was legitimate,\nand a look at his argument illuminates some of his complex\nterminology. The French king possessed sovereignty until he convened\nthe Estates General as representative of the people, at which time\nsovereignty “passed to the people” even though the king\nhad intended for the assembly to resolve specific problems and then\nreturn the reins of power to him (6:341–2). Further, the king\ncould not have any power to restrain the actions of the assembly as a\ncondition for it being given the sovereign power, for there can be no\nrestrictions on this sovereign power. This understanding of\nsovereignty shows the difference between a rebellion against authority\nand peaceful transfer of sovereign power such as an election. In an\nelection, sovereignty is passed back to the people, so there is\nnothing wrong with the people replacing the entire government. Without\nan election (or similar method of designating the return of\nsovereignty to the people), any action aimed at replacing the\ngovernment is wrong. \nKant was long considered to be an exemplar of the retributivist theory\nof punishment. While he does claim that the only proper justification\nof punishment is guilt for a crime, he does not limit the usefulness\nof punishment to retributivist matters. Punishment can have as its\njustification only the guilt of the criminal. All other uses of\npunishment, such as rehabilitation (the alleged good of the criminal)\nor deterrence (alleged good to society) uses the criminal merely as a\nmeans (6:331). Once this guilt is determined, however, Kant does not\ndeny that something useful can be drawn from the punishment. In the\nFeyerabend lectures on Natural Right, Kant is clear that the sovereign\n“must punish in order to obtain security”, and even while\nusing the law of retribution, “in such a way the best security\nis obtained” (27:1390–91). The state is authorized to use\nits coercive force to defend freedom against limitations to freedom;\nmore particularly, since right does not entail that citizens must\nlimit their own freedom but only that “freedom is limited”\nby conditions of right, it is right for another, i.e. the state, to\nactively limit citizens’ freedom in accord with right (6:231). The\nstate is authorized to use force to defend property rights (6:256).\nKant’s view, then, is that punishment of a particular individual may\nserve deterrent functions even when the punishment may not be based\nsolely on deterrence as its justification. \nRetributivist theory holds not only that criminal guilt is required\nfor punishment, but that the appropriate type and amount of punishment\nis also determined by the crime itself. Traditionally this is the\nheart of the ancient injunction “an eye for an eye”. Kant\nsupports this measurement for punishment because all other\nmeasurements bring into consideration elements besides strict justice\n(6:332), such as the psychological states of others that would measure\nthe effectiveness of various possible punishments on deterrence. As a\nprinciple, retribution grounds but does not specify the exact\npunishment. Kant recognizes that “like for like” is not\nalways possible to the letter, but believes that justice requires that\nit be used as the principle for specific judgments of punishment. \nThe retributivist theory of punishment leads to Kant’s insistence on\ncapital punishment. He argues that the only punishment possibly\nequivalent to death, the amount of inflicted harm, is death. Death is\nqualitatively different from any kind of life, so no substitute could\nbe found that would equal death. Kant rejects the argument against\ncapital punishment offered earlier in his century by the Italian\nreformer, the Marchese Cesare Beccaria, who argued that in a social\ncontract no one would willingly give to the state power over one’s own\nlife, for the preservation of that life is the fundamental reason one\nenters a social contract at all. Kant objects to Beccaria’s claim by\ndistinguishing between the source of a social contract in “pure\nreason in me” as opposed to the source of the crime, myself as\ncapable of criminal acts. The latter person wills the crime but not\nthe punishments, but the former person wills in the abstract that\nanyone who is convicted of a capital crime will be punished by death.\nHence one and the same individual both commits the crime and endorses\nthe punishment of death. This solution mirrors the claim that\nindividuals can be coerced to join a civil condition: reason dictates\nthat entering the civil condition is mandatory even if one’s\nparticular arbitrary choice might be to remain outside it (see section\n3). \nIn the “Doctrine of Right” Kant complains that the German\nword used to describe international right,\n“Völkerrecht”, is misleading, for it means literally\nthe right of nations or peoples. He distinguishes this kind of\nrelation among groups of individuals, which he discusses as\nCosmopolitan Right and will be covered in Section 9, from the\nrelations among the political entities, which would better be called\n“Staatenrecht”, the right of states. Nonetheless Kant\nstill uses the phrase “right of nations” and also\ndiscusses a “league of nations”, although it is clear that\nhe is referring not to nations as peoples but to states as\norganizations. Kant is also inconsisistent in his use of other terms,\nsuch as “federation”. For the sake of clarity, this entry\nwill maintain consistent termininology for the discussion of concepts\nin international right, even where that requires departures from\nKant’s own usage.  \nGiven the lack of international institutions, Kant says, states must\nbe considered to be in a state of nature relative to one another. Like\nindividuals in the state of nature, then, they must be considered to\nbe in a state of war with each other. Like individuals, the states are\nobligated to leave this state of nature to form some type of union\nunder a social contract. Before the creation of some such union (see\nnext paragraph), states do have a right to go to war against other\nstates if another state threatens it or actively aggresses against it\n(6:346). But any declaration of war ought to be confirmed by the\npeople “as colegislating members of a state” (6:345).\nRulers who wage war without such consent are using their subjects as\nproperty, as mere means, rather than treating them as ends in\nthemselves. This claim is one of Kant’s strongest statements that\nactual voting by citizens is required: citizens “must therefore\ngive their free assent, through their representatives, not only to\nwaging war in general but also to each particular declaration of\nwar” (6:345–46). Once war has been declared, states are\nobligated to conduct the war under principles that leave open the\npossibility of an eventual league of states. Actions that undermine\nfuture trust between states, such as the use of assassination, are\nprohibited. \nStates are obligated to leave this state of nature among states and\nenter into a union of states. He considers several models of this\nworldwide political institution. The first is a single universal state\nin which the entirety of humanity is ruled directly by the single\nstate or is subject to a single monarch. He rejects this model for\nfailing to fulfill the function of the international institution by in\neffect dissolving the separateness of states rather than providing a\nmeans for peaceful relations among states. The second model is a\nleague of states in which states voluntarily submit themselves to an\norganization for resolving international disputes. The league would\nnot have coercive power to enforce its decisions, and states would be\nfree to leave the league if they chose. He sometimes refers to this\nmodel as a “federation”, although he notes that it cannot\nbe an indissoluble union based upon a constitution, as in the\nfederalist structure of the United States (6:351), so it is best to\nrefer to this model as a “league”. The third model is a\nstate of states or a world republic of states in which each state\njoins a federation of states with coercive power. In this model, a\nstate’s relation to the international federation is closely analogous\nto an individual person’s relation to a state. Only these second and\nthird models receive Kant’s approval. He offers different reasons for\nsupporting each of the two models. \nKant holds out the third model as the ideal form for the correct\ninternational institution. He calls the world republic an\n“idea” (8:357), a term that Kant uses for concepts created\nby the faculty of reason that cannot be met in experience but that can\nserve as models or goals for actual human behavior. The ideal\ninternational union is a federation of states that has coercive power\nover member states but whose decisions arise from debate and\ndiscussion among those member states. Kant is unclear regarding\nwhether that coercive force is to be realized by joint action of\nmember states, sanctioned by the federation, against a non-compliant\nmember or by a distinct international force controlled by the\nfederation itself. The precise status of states’ membership is also\nnot clearly stated: he generally says that states have a right to\nwithdraw from the federation, although he often states that the\nfederation is indissoluble and even indicates in the “Doctrine\nof Right” that states may go to war to “establish a\ncondition more closely approaching a rightful condition”\n(6:344), implying that states can be coerced into membership. Kant\nrecognizes that actual states will balk at this international\nfederation since rulers will object to such a surrender of their\nsovereign power. Kant thus argues that the second model, a league of\nstates in which each state opts to negotiate with other nations\ninstead of waging war, must be adopted as a “negative\nsurrogate” (8:357). In a league of states, individual nations\nare allowed to leave at will and the league itself has no coercive\npowers over members. States voluntarily agree to settle disputes in a\nway that avoids war and encourages further peaceful relations. Leagues\nof states need not extend worldwide but should expand over time in\norder to approximate a worldwide union of all states. \nIn the essay “Toward Perpetual Peace”, Kant offers a set\nof six “preliminary articles” which aim to reduce the\nlikelihood of war, but cannot by themselves establish permanent peace\n(8:343–47). These are a ban on making temporary peace treaties\nwhile still planning for future wars, the prohibition of annexation of\none state by another, the abolition of standing armies, the refusal to\ntake on national debts for external affairs, a ban on interference by\none state in the internal affairs of another, and a set of limits on\nthe conduct of war that disallows acts that would breed mistrust and\nmake peace impossible. These six articles are negative laws that\nprohibit states from engaging in certain kinds of conduct. They are\nnot sufficient by themselves to prevent states from lapsing back into\ntheir old habits of warring on one another. To institute an\ninternational order that can genuinely bring about perpetual peace,\nKant offers three “definitive articles”. The first of\nthese is that every state shall have a republican civil constitution\n(8:348, discussed in section 4 above). In a republican constitution,\nthe people who decide whether there will be a war are the same people\nwho would pay the price for the war, both in monetary terms (taxes and\nother financial burdens) and in flesh and blood. Republican states\nwill therefore be very hesitant to go to war and will readily accept\nnegotiations rather than resort to war. This consideration is Kant’s\nmost important contribution to the debate about securing peace. He\nbelieves that when states are ruled in accordance with the wishes of\nthe people, their self-interest will provide a consistent basis for\npacific relations among states. The second definitive article is that\neach state shall participate in a union of states (8:354, discussed in\nthe previous paragraph). The third definitive article advocates a\ncosmopolitan right of universal hospitality (8:357, discussed in\nsection 9 below).  \nKant’s view of historical progress is tied to his view of\ninternational relations. He actually presents several versions of his\nargument for the progress of humanity toward the ideal condition in\nwhich states, each governed by a republican civil constitution and\nthus each providing maximal consistent freedom for its citizens, all\ncooperate in a republican federation of states. In his essay\n“Idea for a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of\nView” (8:15–31), he takes the basis of his claims for\nhistorical progress to be the culmination of the human ability to\nreason, which, as a natural property of human beings, must be worked\nout to perfection in the species. He argues that incessant wars will\neventually lead rulers to recognize the benefits of peaceful\nnegotiation. They will gradually increase the freedoms of their\ncitizens, because freer citizens are economically more productive and\nhence make the state stronger in its international dealings.\nImportantly he claims that the creation of civil constitutions in\nparticular states is dependent upon the creation of an international\nunion of states, although he does not elaborate on this reasoning. In\n“Toward Perpetual Peace” Kant reverses that order,\nclaiming that some particular state may, through “good\nfortune”, become a republic and then act as a focal point for\nother states to join in peaceful relations, and that gradually such\ncooperation can spread to all states (8:356). These positions\ncertainly reveal that Kant considered world peace impossible without\nboth individual republican states and an international federation\namong them. \nRelations among the states of the world, covered above, are not the\nsame as relations among the peoples (nations, Volk) of the\nworld. Individuals can relate to states of which they are not members\nand to other individuals who are members of other states. In this they\nare considered “citizens of a universal state of human\nbeings” with corresponding “rights of citizens of the\nworld” (8:349, footnote). Despite these lofty sounding\npronouncements, Kant’s particular discussion of cosmopolitan right is\nrestricted to the right of hospitality. Since all peoples share a\nlimited amount of living space due to the spherical shape of the\nearth, the totality of which they must be understood to have\noriginally shared in common, they must be understood to have a right\nto possible interaction with one another. This cosmopolitan right is\nlimited to a right to offer to engage in commerce, not a right to\nactual commerce itself, which must always be voluntary trade. A\ncitizen of one state may try to establish links with other peoples; no\nstate is allowed to deny foreign citizens a right to travel in its\nland.  \nColonial rule and settlement is another matter entirely. In his\npublished writings in the 1790s, Kant is strongly critical of the\nEuropean colonization of other lands already inhabited by other\npeoples. Settlement in these cases is allowed only by uncoerced\ninformed contract. Even land that appears empty might be used by\nshepherds or hunters and cannot be appropriated without their consent\n(6:354). These positions represent a change in Kant’s thought, for he\nhad previously indicated acceptance if not endorsement of the European\ncolonial practices of his time and the racial hierarchy behind them.\nKant himself produced a theory of human racial classifications and\norigins and thought that non-Europeans were inferior in various ways.\nKant thought that the course of world progress involved the spread of\nEuropean culture and law throughout the world to what he considered to\nbe less advanced cultures and inferior races. By the mid-1790s,\nhowever, Kant appears to have given up beliefs about racial\ninferiority and no longer discusses it in his lectures. He publicly\ncriticized European colonial practices as violations of the rights of\nindigenous peoples who are capable of governing themselves (8:358–60).\n \nCosmopolitan right is an important component of perpetual peace.\nInteraction among the peoples of the world, Kant notes, has increased\nin recent times. Now “a violation of right on one place of the\nearth is felt in all” as peoples depend upon one another and\nknow about one another more and more (8:360). Violations of\ncosmopolitan right would make more difficult the trust and cooperation\nnecessary for perpetual peace among states.  \n“Social philosophy,” can be taken to mean the relationship\nof persons to institutions, and to each other via these institutions,\nthat are not part of the state. Family is a clear example of a social\ninstitution that transcends the individual but has at least some\nelements that are not controlled by the state. Other examples would be\neconomic institutions such as businesses and markets, religious\ninstitutions, social clubs and private associations created to advance\ninterests or for mere enjoyment, educational and university\ninstitutions, social systems and classifications such as race and\ngender, and endemic social problems like poverty. It is worth noting a\nfew particulars, if only as examples of the range of this topic. Kant\nadvocated the duty of citizens to support those in society who could\nnot support themselves, and even gave the state the power to arrange\nfor this help (6:326). He offered a biological explanation of race in\nseveral essays and also, certainly into his “Critical”\nperiod, held that other races were inferior to Europeans. He supported\na reform movement in education based on the principles presented by\nRousseau in “Emile”. I will not provide detailed\ntreatement of Kant’s views on these particular matters (some of which\nare scant) but only focus on the nature of social philosophy for Kant.\n \nKant had no comprehensive social philosophy. One might be tempted to\nclaim that, in line with natural law theorists, Kant discusses natural\nrights related to some social institutions. One might read the first\nhalf of the “Doctrine of Right” as a social philosophy,\nsince this half on “Private Right” discusses the rights of\nindividuals relative to one another, in contrast to the second half on\n“Public Right” that discusses the rights of individuals\nrelative to the state. Kant even offers an explanation of this\ndifference by claiming that the opposite of state of nature is not a\nsocial but the civil condition, that is, a state (6:306). The state of\nnature can include voluntary societies (Kant mentions domestic\nrelations in general) where there is no a priori obligation for\nindividuals to enter them. This claim of Kant’s, however, is subject\nto some doubt, since he explicitly links all forms of property to the\nobligation to enter the civil condition (see section 5 above), and his\ndiscussion of marriage and family comes in the form of property\nrelations akin to contract relations. It is thus not obvious how there\ncan be any social institutions that can exist outside the civil\ncondition, to the extent that social institutions presuppose property\nrelations.  \nAnother approach to the issue of social philosophy in Kant is to view\nit in terms of moral philosophy properly speaking, that is, the\nobligations human beings have to act under the proper maxims, as\ndiscussed in the “Doctrine of Virtue” (see section 1\nabove). In the “Doctrine of Virtue” Kant talks about the\nobligation to develop friendships and to participate in social\nintercourse (6:469–74). In the Religion within the\nBoundaries of Mere Reason Kant discusses the development of an\n“ethical commonwealth” in which human beings strengthen\none another’s moral resolve through their participation in the moral\ncommunity of a church. He also holds that educational institutions,\nthe subject of his book On Pedagogy, should be designed to\nprovide for the development of morality in human beings, who lack a\nnatural disposition for the moral good. In these cases Kant’s social\nphilosophy is treated as an arm of his theory of virtue, not as a\nfreestanding topic in its own right. \nA third approach to social philosophy comes through Kant’s\nAnthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View. Kant had\nenvisioned anthropology as an empirical application of ethics, akin to\nempirical physics as a application of pure metaphysical principles of\nnature. Knowledge of the general characteristics of human being as\nwell as particular characteristics of genders, races, nationalities,\netc, can aid in determining one’s precise duties toward particular\nindividuals. Further, this knowledge can aid moral agents in their own\ntask of motivating themselves to morality. These promises of\nanthropology in its practical application are unfulfilled, however, in\nthe details of Kant’s text. He does little critical assessment of\nsocial prejudices or practices to screen out stereotypes detrimental\nto moral development. His own personal views, considered sexist and\nracist universally today and even out of step with some of his more\nprogressive colleagues, pervade his direct discussions of these social\ninstitutions.","contact.mail":"rauscher@msu.edu","contact.domain":"msu.edu"}]
