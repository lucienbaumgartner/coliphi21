His work crosses the boundaries of philosophy,\ntheology, psychology, literary criticism, devotional literature and\nfiction. Kierkegaard brought this potent mixture of discourses to bear\nas social critique and for the purpose of renewing Christian faith\nwithin Christendom. At the same time he made many original conceptual\ncontributions to each of the disciplines he employed. He is known as\nthe “father of existentialism”, but at least as important\nare his critiques of Hegel and of the German romantics, his\ncontributions to the development of modernism, his stylistic\nexperimentation, his vivid re-presentation of biblical figures to\nbring out their modern relevance, his invention of key concepts which\nhave been explored and redeployed by thinkers ever since, his\ninterventions in contemporary Danish church politics, and his fervent\nattempts to analyse and revitalise Christian faith.\n\nKierkegaard led a somewhat uneventful life. He rarely left his\nhometown of Copenhagen, and travelled abroad only five\ntimes—four times to Berlin and once to Sweden. His prime\nrecreational activities were attending the theatre, walking the\nstreets of Copenhagen to chat with ordinary people, and taking brief\ncarriage jaunts into the surrounding countryside. He was educated at a\nprestigious boys’ school (Borgerdydskolen), then\nattended Copenhagen University where he studied philosophy and\ntheology. His teachers at the university included F.C. Sibbern, Poul\nMartin Møller, and H.L. Martensen. \nSibbern and Møller were both philosophers who also wrote\nfiction. The latter in particular had a great influence on\nKierkegaard’s philosophico-literary development. Martensen also\nhad a profound effect on Kierkegaard, but largely in a negative\nmanner. Martensen was a champion of Hegelianism, and when he became\nBishop Primate of the Danish People’s Church, Kierkegaard\npublished a vitriolic attack on Martensen’s theological views.\nKierkegaard’s brother Peter, on the other hand, was an adherent\nof Martensen and himself became a bishop. Kierkegaard regarded\nMartensen as one of his chief intellectual rivals. Martensen was only\nfive years his senior, but was already lecturing at Copenhagen\nUniversity when Kierkegaard was a student there. Martensen also\nanticipated Kierkegaard’s first major literary project, by\npublishing a book on Faust. Kierkegaard, who had been working up a\nproject on the three great medieval figures of Don Juan, Faust and\nAhasuerus (the wandering Jew), abandoned his own project when\nMartensen’s book appeared, although he later incorporated much\nof the work he had done into Either/Or.  \nAnother very important figure in Kierkegaard’s life was J.L.\nHeiberg, the doyen of Copenhagen’s literati. Heiberg, more than\nany other person, was responsible for introducing Hegelianism into\nDenmark. Kierkegaard spent a good deal of energy trying to break into\nthe Heiberg literary circle, but desisted once he had found his own\nvoice in The Concept of Irony. Kierkegaard’s first\nmajor publication, From the Papers of One Still Living, is\nlargely an attempt to articulate a Heibergian aesthetics—which\nis a modified version of Hegel’s aesthetics. In From the\nPapers of One Still Living, which is a critical review of Hans\nChristian Andersen’s novel Only A Fiddler, Kierkegaard\nattacks Andersen for lacking life-development\n(Livs-Udvikling) and an outlook on life\n(Livs-Anskuelse) both of which Kierkegaard deemed necessary\nfor someone to be a genuine novelist (Romandigter). \nKierkegaard’s life is more relevant to his work than is the case\nfor many writers. Much of the thrust of his critique of Hegelianism is\nthat its system of thought is abstracted from the everyday lives of\nits proponents. This existential critique consists in demonstrating\nhow the life and work of a philosopher contradict one another.\nKierkegaard derived this form of critique from the Greek notion of\njudging philosophers by their lives rather than simply by their\nintellectual artefacts. The Christian ideal, according to Kierkegaard,\nis even more exacting since the totality of an individual’s\nexistence is the artefact on the basis of which s/he is judged by God\nfor h/er eternal validity. Of course a writer’s work is an\nimportant part of h/er existence, but for the purpose of judgement we\nshould focus on the whole life not just on one part. \nIn a less abstract manner, an understanding of Kierkegaard’s\nbiography is important for an understanding of his writing because his\nlife was the source of many of the preoccupations and repetitions\nwithin his oeuvre. Because of his existentialist orientation,\nmost of his interventions in contemporary theory do double duty as\nmeans of working through events from his own life. In particular\nKierkegaard’s relations to his father and his fiancée\nRegine Olsen pervade his work. Kierkegaard’s pseudonym Johannes\nClimacus says of Socrates that “his whole life was personal\npreoccupation with himself, and then Governance comes and adds\nworld-historical significance to it.” Similarly, Kierkegaard saw\nhimself as a “singular universal” whose personal\npreoccupation with himself was transfigured by divine Governance into\nuniversal significance.  \nKierkegaard’s relation to his mother is the least frequently\ncommented upon since it is invisible in his work. His mother does not\nrate a direct mention in his published works, or in his\ndiaries—not even on the day she died. However, for a writer who\nplaces so much emphasis on indirect communication, and on the\nsemiotics of invisibility, we should regard this absence as\nsignificant. Johannes Climacus in Concluding Unscientific\nPostscript remarks, “… how deceptive then, that an\nomnipresent being should be recognisable precisely by being\ninvisible.” Although Kierkegaard’s mother is absent, his\nmother-tongue (Modersmaal—etymologically derived from\nthe words for “mother” and “measure”) is\nalmost omnipresent. Kierkegaard was deeply enamoured of the Danish\nlanguage and worked throughout his writings to assert the strengths of\nhis mother-tongue over the invasive, imperialistic influences of Latin\nand German. With respect to the former, Kierkegaard had to petition\nthe king to be allowed to write his philosophy dissertation On the\nConcept of Irony with constant reference to Socrates in Danish.\nEven though permission was granted he was still required to defend his\ndissertation publicly in Latin. Latin had been the pan-European\nlanguage of science and scholarship. In Denmark, in\nKierkegaard’s time, German language and culture were at least as\ndominant as Latin in the production of knowledge. In defiance of this,\nKierkegaard revelled in his mother-tongue and created some of the most\nbeautifully poetic prose in the Danish language—including a\npaean to his mother-tongue in Stages On Life’s Way. In\nRepetition (1843), the character and pseudonymous author\nConstantin Constantius congratulates the Danish language on providing\nthe word for an important new philosophical concept,\nviz. Gjentagelse (repetition), to replace the foreign word\n“mediation”. In general, we might regard the Danish\nlanguage as Kierkegaard’s umbilical attachment to the mother\nwhereas Latin and German represent the law of the father, especially\nwhen employed in systematic scholarship or science\n(Videnskab). \nThe influence of Kierkegaard’s father on his work has been\nfrequently noted. Not only did Kierkegaard inherit his father’s\nmelancholy, his sense of guilt and anxiety, and his pietistic emphasis\non the dour aspects of Christian faith, but he also inherited his\ntalents for philosophical argument and creative imagination. In\naddition Kierkegaard inherited enough of his father’s wealth to\nallow him to pursue his life as a freelance writer. The themes of\nsacrificial father/son relationships, of inherited sin, of the burden\nof history, and of the centrality of the “individual, human\nexistence relationship, the old text, well known, handed down from the\nfathers” (Postscript) are repeated many times in\nKierkegaard’s oeuvre. The father’s sense of guilt was so\ngreat (for having cursed God? for having impregnated\nKierkegaard’s mother out of wedlock?) that he thought God would\npunish him by taking the lives of all seven of his children before\nthey reached the age of 34 (the age of Jesus Christ at his\ncrucifixion). This was born out for all but two of the children,\nSøren and his older brother Peter. Søren was astonished\nthat they both survived beyond that age. This may explain the sense of\nurgency that drove Kierkegaard to write so prolifically in the years\nleading up to his 34th birthday. \nKierkegaard’s (broken) engagement to Regine Olsen has also been\nthe focus of much scholarly attention. The theme of a young woman\nbeing the occasion for a young man to become “poeticized”\nrecurs in Kierkegaard’s writings, as does the theme of the\nsacrifice of worldly happiness for a higher (religious) purpose.\nKierkegaard’s infatuation with Regine, and the sublimated\nlibidinal energy it lent to his poetic production, were crucial for\nsetting his life course. The breaking of the engagement allowed\nKierkegaard to devote himself monastically to his religious purpose,\nas well as to establish his outsider status (outside the norm of\nmarried bourgeois life). It also freed him from close personal\nentanglements with women, thereby leading him to objectify them as\nideal creatures, and to reproduce the patriarchal values of his church\nand father. The latter included viewing women in terms of their\ntraditional social roles, particularly as mothers and wives, but also\nin their traditional spiritual roles as epitomes of devotion and\nself-sacrifice. Nevertheless, whatever one’s life circumstances,\nsocial roles and gender, Kierkegaard regarded everyone as equal before\nGod under the aspect of eternity.  \nKierkegaard’s central problematic was how to become a\nChristian in Christendom. The task was most difficult for the\nwell-educated, since prevailing educational and cultural institutions\ntended to produce stereotyped members of “the crowd”\nrather than to allow individuals to discover their own unique\nidentities. This problem was compounded by the fact that Denmark had\nrecently and very rapidly been transformed from a feudal society into\na capitalist society. Universal elementary education, large-scale\nmigration from rural areas into cities, and greatly increased social\nmobility meant that the social structure changed from a rigidly\nhierarchical one to a relatively “horizontal” one. In this\ncontext it became increasingly difficult to “become who you\nare” for two reasons: (i) social identities were unusually\nfluid; and (ii) there was a proliferation of normalizing institutions\nwhich produced pseudo-individuals.  \nGiven this problematic in this social context Kierkegaard perceived a\nneed to invent a form of communication which would not produce\nstereotyped identities. On the contrary, he needed a form of rhetoric\nwhich would force people back onto their own resources, to take\nresponsibility for their own existential choices, and to become who\nthey are beyond their socially imposed identities. In this undertaking\nKierkegaard was inspired by the figure of Socrates, whose incessant\nirony undermined all knowledge claims that were taken for granted or\nunreflectively inherited from traditional culture. In his dissertation\nOn the Concept of Irony with constant reference to Socrates\nKierkegaard argued that the historical Socrates used his irony in\norder to facilitate the birth of subjectivity in his interlocutors.\nBecause they were constantly forced to abandon their immediate answers\nto Socrates’ annoying questions, they had to begin to think for\nthemselves and to take individual responsibility for their claims\nabout knowledge and value. \nKierkegaard sought to provide a similar service for his own\ncontemporaries. He used irony, parody, satire, humor, and\ndeconstructive techniques in order to make conventionally accepted\nforms of knowledge and value untenable. He was a\ngadfly—constantly irritating his contemporaries with\ndiscomforting thoughts. He was also a midwife—assisting at the\nbirth of individual subjectivity by forcing his contemporaries to\ndevelop an inner life through critical self-reflection. His art of\ncommunication became “the art of taking away”\nsince he thought his audience suffered from too much knowledge rather\nthan too little. \nHegelianism promised to make absolute knowledge available by virtue of\na science of logic. Anyone with the capacity to follow the dialectical\nprogression of the purportedly transparent concepts of Hegel’s\nlogic would have access to the mind of God (which for Hegel was\nequivalent to the logical structure of the universe). Kierkegaard\nthought this to be the hubristic attempt to build a new tower of\nBabel, or a scala paradisi—a dialectical ladder by\nwhich humans can climb with ease up to heaven. Kierkegaard’s\nstrategy was to invert this dialectic by seeking to make everything\nmore difficult. Instead of seeing scientific knowledge as the means of\nhuman redemption, he regarded it as the greatest obstacle to\nredemption. Instead of seeking to give people more knowledge he sought\nto take away what passed for knowledge. Instead of seeking to make God\nand Christian faith perfectly intelligible he sought to emphasize the\nabsolute transcendence by God of all human categories. Instead of\nsetting himself up as a religious authority, Kierkegaard used a vast\narray of textual devices to undermine his authority as an author and\nto place responsibility for the existential significance to be derived\nfrom his texts squarely on the reader. \nKierkegaard distanced himself from his texts by a variety of devices\nwhich served to problematize the authorial voice for the reader. He\nused pseudonyms in many of his works (both overtly aesthetic ones and\novertly religious ones). He partitioned the texts into prefaces,\nforewords, interludes, postscripts, appendices. He assigned the\n“authorship” of parts of texts to different pseudonyms,\nand invented further pseudonyms to be the editors or compilers of\nthese pseudonymous writings. Sometimes Kierkegaard appended his name\nas author, sometimes as the person responsible for publication,\nsometimes not at all. Sometimes Kierkegaard would publish more than\none book on the same day. These simultaneous books embodied strikingly\ncontrasting perspectives. He also published whole series of\nworks simultaneously, viz. the pseudonymous works on the one hand and\non the other hand the Edifying Discourses published under his\nown name. \nAll of this play with narrative point of view, with contrasting works,\nand with contrasting internal partitions within individual works\nleaves the reader very disoriented. In combination with the incessant\nplay of irony and Kierkegaard’s predilection for paradox and\nsemantic opacity, the text becomes a polished surface for the reader\nin which the prime meaning to be discerned is the reader’s own\nreflection. Christian faith, for Kierkegaard, is not a matter of\nlearning dogma by rote. It is a matter of the individual repeatedly\nrenewing h/er passionate subjective relationship to an object which\ncan never be known, but only believed in. This belief is offensive to\nreason, since it only exists in the face of the absurd (the paradox of\nthe eternal, immortal, infinite God being incarnated in time as a\nfinite mortal). \nKierkegaard’s “method of indirect communication” was\ndesigned to sever the reliance of the reader on the authority of the\nauthor and on the received wisdom of the community. The reader was to\nbe forced to take individual responsibility for knowing who s/he is\nand for knowing where s/he stands on the existential, ethical and\nreligious issues raised in the texts. \nWhile much of Kierkegaard’s writing is presented indirectly,\nunder various pseudonyms, he did publish some works under his own name.\nThese works fall into three genres: (i) deliberations; (ii) edifying\ndiscourses; and (iii) reviews. The point of indirect communication is\nto position the reader to relate to the truth with appropriate\npassion, rather than to communicate the truth as such. In a review,\nhowever, it is appropriate to be objective, especially in drawing out\na novel’s life-view and life-development. A deliberation\n(Overveielse), on the other hand, ought to be provocative,\nand turn the reader’s assumptions topsy-turvy. It draws on\nirony, the comic and is high-spirited, in order to get thoughts into\nmotion prior to action. A deliberation is a weighing-up, as a\npropaedeutic to action. An edifying discourse [Opbyggelige\nTale], by contrast, “rests in a mood” and presupposes\nthat the reader is already in faith. It seeks to build up the faith\nthat it presupposes. Typically Kierkegaard’s Edifying\nDiscourses invite “that single individual, my reader”\nto dwell with a biblical passage for the sake of building up faith.\nKierkegaard published many of his Edifying Discourses in\nshort collections to accompany particular pseudonymous texts, then\nlater published them again in larger collections. He also published\nvarious “Discourses at the Communion on Fridays”, which\nclosely resemble sermons (although they are delivered “without\nauthority”). These are particularly intimate addresses to the\nsincere Christian, who strives to deepen the subjective passion of\nfaith through confession and through acceptance of divine\nforgiveness. \nKierkegaard draws attention to Christianity’s “inverted\ndialectic”, which demands that we exercise “double\nvision”, to see in worldly things their spiritual opposites,\nsuch as hope in hopelessness, strength in weakness and prosperity in\nadversity. The inverse dialectic also requires that we\n“reduplicate” our thoughts in our actions, but in so doing\nthat we “work against ourselves”. This was aimed at\nsubverting our focus on worldly goals in order to refocus on\nother-worldly goals. \nKierkegaard’s rhetorical play with the inverse Christian\ndialectic was designed not to make the word of God easier to\nassimilate, but to establish more clearly the absolute distance that\nseparates human beings from God. This was in order to emphasize that\nhuman beings are absolutely reliant on God’s grace for\nsalvation. While most commentators regard Kierkegaard’s view to\nbe that sin is what separates human beings absolutely from\nGod, thereby lending weight to the view that Kierkegaard endorses a\nparticularly dour version of Christianity, a more defensible\ninterpretation is that it is the transcendent God’s capacity to\nforgive the unforgivable that marks the absolute difference. Our\nstruggle to accept divine forgiveness can become mired in despair,\nincluding the second-order despair over the impossibility of\nforgiveness of our sins and the demonic despair of defiance in which\nwe refuse to accept forgiveness. On the other hand, faith in divine\nforgiveness can manifest in joy, at the realization that for God\nanything is possible, including our “rebirth” as spiritual\nselves with “eternal validity”. \nKierkegaard presents his “first” pseudonymous authorship\n(Either-Or to Concluding Unscientific Postscript) as\na dialectical progression of existential stages. The first is the\naesthetic, which gives way to the ethical, which gives way to the\nreligious. The aesthetic stage of existence is characterized by the\nfollowing: immersion in sensuous experience; valorization of\npossibility over actuality; egotism; fragmentation of the subject of\nexperience; nihilistic wielding of irony and scepticism; and flight\nfrom boredom.\n \nThe figure of the aesthete in Either-Or (Part One) is an\nironic portrayal of German romanticism, but it also draws on medieval\ncharacters as diverse as Don Juan, Ahasuerus, and Faust. It finds its\nmost sophisticated form in the author of “The Seducer’s\nDiary”, the final section of Either-Or (Part One).\nJohannes the seducer is a reflective aesthete, who gains\nsensuous delight not so much from the act of seduction but from\nengineering the possibility of seduction. His real aim is the\nmanipulation of people and situations in ways which generate\ninteresting reflections in his own voyeuristic mind. The aesthetic\nperspective transforms quotidian dullness into a richly poetic world\nby whatever means it can. Sometimes the reflective aesthete will\ninject interest into a book by reading only the last third, or into a\nconversation by provoking a bore into an apoplectic fit so that he can\nsee a bead of sweat form between the bore’s eyes and run down\nhis nose. That is, the aesthete uses artifice, arbitrariness, irony,\nand wilful imagination to recreate the world in his own image. The\nprime motivation for the aesthete is the transformation of the boring\ninto the interesting. \nThis type of aestheticism is criticized from the point of view of\nethics. It is seen to be emptily self-serving and escapist. It is a\ndespairing means of avoiding commitment and responsibility. It fails\nto acknowledge one’s social debt and communal existence. And it\nis self-deceiving insofar as it substitutes fantasies for actual\nstates of affairs. \nBut Kierkegaard did not want to abandon aesthetics altogether in favor\nof the ethical and the religious. A key concept in the Hegelian\ndialectic, which Kierkegaard’s pseudonymous authorship parodies,\nis Aufhebung (sublation). In Hegel’s dialectic, when\ncontradictory positions are reconciled in a higher unity (synthesis)\nthey are both annulled and preserved (aufgehoben). Similarly\nwith Kierkegaard’s pseudo-dialectic: the aesthetic and the\nethical are both annulled and preserved in their synthesis in the\nreligious stage. As far as the aesthetic stage of existence is\nconcerned what is preserved in the higher religious stage is the sense\nof infinite possibility made available through the imagination. But\nthis no longer excludes what is actual. Nor is it employed for\negotistic ends. Aesthetic irony is transformed into religious humor,\nand the aesthetic transfiguration of the actual world into\nthe ideal is transformed into the religious\ntransubstantiation of the finite world into an actual\nreconciliation with the infinite. \nBut the dialectic of the “first” pseudonymous authorship\nnever quite reaches the highest, paradoxical form of the religious. We\nstop short at the representation of the religious by a\nself-confessed humorist (Johannes Climacus) in a medium which,\naccording to Climacus’s own account, necessarily alienates the\nreader from true (Christian) faith. For faith is a matter of lived\nexperience, of constant striving within an individual’s\nexistence. According to Climacus’s metaphysics, the world is\ndivided dualistically into the actual and the ideal. Language (and all\nother media of representation) belong to the realm of the ideal. No\nmatter how eloquent or evocative language is it can never be\nthe actual. Therefore, any representation of faith is always suspended\nin the realm of ideality and can never\nbe actual faith. \nSo the whole dialectic of the “first” pseudonymous\nauthorship is recuperated by the aesthetic by virtue of its medium of\nrepresentation. In fact Johannes Climacus acknowledges this implicitly\nwhen at the end of\nConcluding Unscientific Postscript he revokes\neverything he has said, with the important rider that to say something\nthen to revoke it is not the same as never having said it in the first\nplace. His presentation of religious faith in an aesthetic medium at\nleast provides an opportunity for his readers to make their own leap\nof faith, by appropriating with inward passion the paradoxical\nreligion of Christianity into their own lives. \nKierkegaard also uses aesthetic devices, including pseudonyms, in his\n“second” authorship, that is, those published\nafter Concluding Unscientific Postscript. These works include\nthose by Anti-Climacus, who represents the Christian point of\nview par excellence, beyond where Kierkegaard placed\nhimself. Kierkegaard also used many biblical figures and stories with\npoignant and striking effect in the religious writings he published\nunder his own name. As a poet of the religious Kierkegaard was always\npreoccupied with aesthetics. In fact, contrary to popular\nmisconceptions of Kierkegaard which represent him as becoming\nincreasingly hostile to poetry, he increasingly referred to himself as\na poet in his later years (all but one of over ninety references to\nhimself as a poet in his journals date from after 1847). Kierkegaard\nnever claimed to write with religious authority, as an apostle. His\nworks represent both less religiously enlightened and more religiously\nenlightened positions than he thought he had attained in his own\nexistence. Such representations were only possible in an aesthetic\nmedium of imagined possibilities like poetry. \nLike the terms “aesthetic” and “religious”,\nthe term “ethics” in Kierkegaard’s work has more\nthan one meaning. It is used to denote both: (i) a limited existential\nsphere, or stage, which is superseded by the higher stage of the\nreligious life; and (ii) an aspect of life which is retained even\nwithin the religious life. In the first sense “ethics” is\nsynonymous with the Hegelian notion of Sittlichkeit, or\ncustomary mores. In this sense “ethics” represents\n“the universal”, or more accurately the prevailing social\nnorms. These social norms are used as reasons to make sense of, or\njustify, an action within a community. Even human sacrifice is\njustified in terms of how it serves the community, so that when\nAgamemnon sacrifices his daughter Iphigenia he is regarded as a tragic\nhero since his community understands that the sacrifice is required by\nthe gods for the success of the Greek expedition to Troy (Fear and\nTrembling).  \nKierkegaard, however, recognizes duties that cannot be justified in\nterms of social norms. Much of Fear and Trembling turns on\nthe notion that Abraham’s would-be sacrifice of his son Isaac is\nineffable in terms of social norms, and requires a “teleological\nsuspension of the ethical”. That is, Abraham recognizes a duty\nto something higher than both his social duty not to kill an innocent\nperson and his personal commitment to his beloved son, viz. his duty\nto obey God’s commands. However, he cannot give an intelligible\nethical justification of his act to the community in terms of social\nnorms, but must simply obey the divine command. \nBut in order to arrive at a position of religious faith, which might\nentail a “teleological suspension of the ethical”, the\nindividual must first embrace the ethical (in the first sense). In\norder to raise oneself beyond the merely aesthetic life, which is a\nlife of drifting in imagination, possibility and sensation, one needs\nto make a commitment. That is, the aesthete needs to choose the\nethical, which entails a commitment to communication and decision\nprocedures. \nThe ethical position advocated by Judge Wilhelm in “Equilibrium\nBetween the Aesthetic and the Ethical in the Composition of\nPersonality” (Either-Or II) is a peculiar mix of\ncognitivism and noncognitivism. The metaethics or normative ethics are\ncognitivist, laying down various necessary conditions for ethically\ncorrect action. These conditions include: the necessity of choosing\nseriously and inwardly; commitment to the belief that predications of\ngood and evil of our actions have a truth-value; the necessity of\nchoosing what one is actually doing, rather than just responding to a\nsituation; actions are to be in accordance with rules; and these rules\nare universally applicable to moral agents. \nThe choice of metaethics, however, is noncognitive. There is no\nadequate proof of the truth of metaethics. The choice of normative\nethics is motivated, but in a noncognitive way. The Judge seeks to\nmotivate the choice of his normative ethics through the avoidance of\ndespair. Here despair (Fortvivlelse) is to let one’s\nlife depend on conditions outside one’s control (and later, more\nradically, despair is the very possibility of despair in this first\nsense). For Judge Wilhelm, the choice of normative ethics is a\nnoncognitive choice of cognitivism, and thereby an acceptance of the\napplicability of the conceptual distinction between good and evil. \nFrom Kierkegaard’s religious perspective, however, the\nconceptual distinction between good and evil is ultimately dependent\nnot on social norms but on God. Therefore it is possible, as Johannes\nde Silentio argues was the case for Abraham (the father of faith),\nthat God demand a suspension of the ethical (in the sense of the\nsocially prescribed norms). This is still ethical in the second sense,\nsince ultimately God’s definition of the distinction between\ngood and evil outranks any human society’s definition. The\nrequirement of communicability and clear decision procedures can also\nbe suspended by God’s fiat. This renders cases such as\nAbraham’s extremely problematic, since we have no recourse to\npublic reason to decide whether he is legitimately obeying God’s\ncommand or whether he is a deluded would-be murderer. Since public\nreason cannot decide the issue for us, we must decide for ourselves as\na matter of religious faith. \nKierkegaard’s ultimate advocacy of divine command metaethics is\ntempered somewhat by his detailed analyses of the nuanced ways\nindividuals need to relate to God’s commands. These analyses\namount to a subtle moral psychology, which borders on virtue ethics.\nIt is not enough simply for God to issue a command; we need to hear\nand obey. But obedience is not straightforward. We can obey willingly\nor begrudgingly. We can refuse altogether. We can be selectively deaf,\nor be so filled with our egotistical desires that we are altogether\ndeaf to our duties. In order to obey we first need to cultivate faith,\nsince obedience to a divine command is nonsense unless we at least\nbelieve the command has come from God. To cultivate faith in a\ntranscendent, eternal, omnipresent God, who allegedly became incarnate\nin the form of a particular human being who was put to death, requires\none to overcome the offense to one’s reason and to adopt a\ntolerance for paradox. To imagine the enormity of the consequences of\nsin, yet to relish the possibilities of freedom, engenders anxiety. We\nneed to learn to navigate the treacherous maelstroms of despair, to\nrecognize the self-absorption of demonic states, to veer away from\nprudence and vanity, and to avoid mere conformity to social mores. We\nneed to cultivate hope, patience, devotion, and above all love. But we\nalso need to be vigilant about our capacity for self-deception and be\nprepared to suffer for love and for our ultimate spiritual\nidentity. \nKierkegaard styled himself above all as a religious poet. The religion\nto which he sought to relate his readers is Christianity. The type of\nChristianity that underlies his writings is a very serious strain of\nLutheran pietism informed by the dour values of sin, guilt, suffering,\nand individual responsibility. Kierkegaard was immersed in these\nvalues in the family home through his father, whose own childhood was\nlived in the shadow of Herrnhut pietism in Jutland.\nKierkegaard’s father subsequently became a member of the lay\nCongregation of Brothers (Brødremenighed) in\nCopenhagen, which he and his family attended in addition to the\nsermons by Bishop J. P. Mynster. \nFor Kierkegaard Christian faith is not a matter of regurgitating\nchurch dogma. It is a matter of individual subjective passion, which\ncannot be mediated by the clergy or by human artefacts. Faith is the\nmost important task to be achieved by a human being, because only on\nthe basis of faith does an individual have a chance to become a true\nself. This self is the life-work which God judges for eternity. \nThe individual is thereby subject to an enormous burden of\nresponsibility, for upon h/er existential choices hangs h/er eternal\nsalvation or damnation. Anxiety or dread (Angest) is the\npresentiment of this terrible responsibility when the individual\nstands at the threshold of momentous existential choice. Anxiety is a\ntwo-sided emotion: on one side is the dread burden of choosing for\neternity; on the other side is the exhilaration of freedom in choosing\noneself. Choice occurs in the instant (Øieblikket),\nwhich is the point at which time and eternity intersect—for the\nindividual creates through temporal choice a self which will be judged\nfor eternity. \nBut the choice of faith is not made once and for all. It is essential\nthat faith be constantly renewed by means of repeated avowals of\nfaith. One’s very selfhood depends upon this repetition, for\naccording to Anti-Climacus, the self “is a relation which\nrelates itself to itself” (The Sickness Unto Death).\nBut unless this self acknowledges a “power which constituted\nit,” it falls into a despair which undoes its selfhood.\nTherefore, in order to maintain itself as a relation which relates\nitself to itself, the self must constantly renew its faith in\n“the power which posited it.” There is no\nmediation between the individual self and God by priest or by\nlogical system (contra Catholicism and Hegelianism\nrespectively). There is only the individual’s own\nrepetition of faith. This repetition of faith is the way the\nself relates itself to itself and to the power which constituted it,\ni.e., the repetition of faith is the self. \nChristian dogma, according to Kierkegaard, embodies paradoxes which\nare offensive to reason. The central paradox is the assertion that the\neternal, infinite, transcendent God simultaneously became incarnated\nas a temporal, finite, human being (Jesus). There are two possible\nattitudes we can adopt to this assertion, viz. we can have faith, or\nwe can take offense. What we cannot do, according to Kierkegaard, is\nbelieve by virtue of reason. If we choose faith we must suspend our\nreason in order to believe in something higher than reason. In fact we\nmust believe by virtue of the absurd. \nMuch of Kierkegaard’s authorship explores the notion of the\nabsurd: Job gets everything back again by virtue of the absurd\n(Repetition); Abraham gets a reprieve from having to\nsacrifice Isaac, by virtue of the absurd (Fear and\nTrembling); Kierkegaard hoped to get Regine back again after\nbreaking off their engagement, by virtue of the absurd\n(Journals); Climacus hopes to deceive readers into the truth\nof Christianity by virtue of an absurd representation of\nChristianity’s ineffability; the Christian God is represented as\nabsolutely transcendent of human categories yet is absurdly presented\nas a personal God with the human capacities to love, judge, forgive,\nteach, etc. Kierkegaard’s notion of the absurd subsequently\nbecame an important category for twentieth century existentialists,\nthough usually devoid of its religious associations. \nAccording to Johannes Climacus, faith is a miracle, a gift from God\nwhereby eternal truth enters time in the instant. This Christian\nconception of the relation between (eternal) truth and time is\ndistinct from the Socratic notion that (eternal) truth is always\nalready within us—it just needs to be recovered by means of\nrecollection (anamnesis). The condition for realizing\n(eternal) truth for the Christian is a gift (Gave) from God,\nbut its realization is a task (Opgave) which must be\nrepeatedly performed by the individual believer. Whereas Socratic\nrecollection is a recuperation of the past, Christian repetition is a\n“recollection forwards”—so that the eternal (future)\ntruth is captured in time. \nCrucial to the miracle of Christian faith is the realization that over\nagainst God we are always in the wrong. That is, we must realize that\nwe are always in sin. This is the condition for faith, and must be\ngiven by God. The idea of sin cannot evolve from purely human origins.\nRather, it must have been introduced into the world from a\ntranscendent source. Once we understand that we are in sin, we can\nunderstand that there is some being over against which we are always\nin the wrong. On this basis we can have faith that, by virtue of the\nabsurd, we can ultimately be atoned with this being. The absurdity of\natonement requires faith that we believe that for God even the\nimpossible is possible, including the forgiveness of the unforgivable.\nIf we can accept God’s forgiveness, sincerely, inwardly,\ncontritely, with gratitude and hope, then we open ourselves to the\njoyous prospect of beginning anew. The only obstacle to this joy is\nour refusal or resistance to accepting God’s forgiveness\nproperly. Although God can forgive the unforgivable, He cannot force\nanyone to accept it. Therefore, for Kierkegaard, “there is only\none guilt that God cannot forgive, that of not willing to believe in\nhis greatness!”.  \nKierkegaard is sometimes regarded as an apolitical thinker, but in\nfact he intervened stridently in church politics, cultural politics,\nand in the turbulent social changes of his time. His earliest\npublished essay, for example, was a polemic against women’s\nliberation. It is a reactionary apologetic for the prevailing\npatriarchal values, and was motivated largely by Kierkegaard’s\ndesire to ingratiate himself with factions within Copenhagen’s\nintellectual circles. This latter desire gradually left him, but his\nrelation to women remained highly questionable.  \nOne of Kierkegaard’s main interventions in cultural politics was\nhis sustained attack on Hegelianism. Hegel’s philosophy had been\nintroduced into Denmark with religious zeal by J.L. Heiberg, and was\ntaken up enthusiastically within the theology faculty of Copenhagen\nUniversity and by Copenhagen’s literati. Kierkegaard, too, was\ninduced to make a serious study of Hegel’s work. While\nKierkegaard greatly admired Hegel, he had grave reservations about\nHegelianism and its bombastic promises. Hegel would have been the\ngreatest thinker who ever lived, said Kierkegaard, if only he had\nregarded his system as a thought-experiment. Instead he took himself\nseriously to have reached the truth, and so rendered himself\ncomical. \nKierkegaard’s tactic in undermining Hegelianism was to produce\nan elaborate parody of Hegel’s entire system. The pseudonymous\nauthorship, from Either-Or to Concluding Unscientific\nPostscript, presents an inverted Hegelian dialectic which is\ndesigned to take away readers’ presumed knowledge rather than\nadd to it. This authorship snipes simultaneously at German romanticism\nand contemporary Danish literati (with J.L. Heiberg receiving much\nacerbic comment). However, it also draws heavily on the work of these\nauthors, especially by taking seriously their framing of philosophical\nand theological problems. For example, Kierkegaard engaged with the\nearly German romantics’ notion that modernity is to be\nunderstood primarily by contrast with antiquity, which in turn is to\nbe understood mainly in terms of classical Greek thought. Classical\nGreek art, in particular, is taken to be the gold standard by which\nartistic perfection is to be measured. However, Kierkegaard and the\nGerman romantics and German idealists share the view that classical\nGreek art lacks inwardness or subjective spirit. Modern art, by\ncontrast, while unlikely to match the formal perfection of classical\nGreek art, contains the potential to explore subjective spirit. One\ncrucial dimension of subjective spirit is freedom, which becomes a\ndistinctive preoccupation of modern art and post-Kantian philosophy.\nKierkegaard’s concept of individual freedom, ultimately\nunderstood in terms of becoming as nothing before God, engages\ncritically with the concepts of freedom in Kant, Hegel and Schelling,\nas well as with the theologies of Jacobi, Lessing and Schleiermacher.\nKierkegaard presents a distinctive phenomenology of freedom by means\nof fictional case studies in a method he calls “experimenting\npsychology”. He uses narrative points of view, pseudonyms,\nvignettes, character sketches and case studies from life and\nliterature to illustrate how dialectics of moods, emotions and spirit\ncan both disable and enable individual freedom. Moods such as\nmelancholy, boredom and irony can become demonically\nself-perpetuating, but they also have the potential to lift the\nindividual to a state of self-reflection that amounts to higher order\nconsciousness, thereby enabling the individual to see his or her\nformer existence as what Wittgenstein called a limited whole. The\nhighest order of consciousness for Kierkegaard is God-consciousness,\nwhich enables the individual to see himself or herself as both a\nsinner and as open to divine grace. The path to this ultimate freedom\nrequires will, imagination, faith, love, penitence, patience and a\nhumble kenosis, whereby the self is emptied of will to become\nreceptive to God’s will. \nKierkegaard’s intriguing pseudonymous “first\nauthorship”, culminating in Concluding Unscientific\nPostscript, received little popular attention, aimed as it was at\nthe literary elite. So it had little immediate effect as discursive\naction. Kierkegaard sought to remedy this by provoking an attack on\nhimself in the popular satirical review The Corsair.\nKierkegaard succeeded in having himself mercilessly lampooned in this\npublication, largely on personal grounds rather than in terms of the\nsubstance of his writings. The suffering incurred by these attacks\nsparked Kierkegaard into another highly productive phase of\nauthorship, but this time his focus was the creation of positive\nChristian discourses rather than satire or parody. \nEventually Kierkegaard became more and more worried about the\ndirection taken by the Danish People’s Church, especially after\nthe death of the Bishop Primate J.P. Mynster. He realized he could no\nlonger indulge himself in the painstakingly erudite and poetically\nmeticulous writing he had practised hitherto. He had to intervene\ndecisively in a popular medium, so he published his own pamphlet under\nthe title The Instant or The Moment\n(Øieblikket). This addressed church politics directly\nand increasingly shrilly. \nThere were two main foci of Kierkegaard’s concern in church\npolitics. One was the influence of Hegel, largely through the\nteachings of H.L. Martensen; the other was the popularity of N.F.S.\nGrundtvig, a theologian, educator and poet who composed most of the\npieces in the Danish hymn book. Grundtvig’s theology was\ndiametrically opposed to Kierkegaard’s in tone. Grundtvig\nemphasized the light, joyous, celebratory and communal aspects of\nChristianity, whereas Kierkegaard emphasized seriousness, suffering,\nsin, guilt, and individual isolation. Kierkegaard’s intervention\nfailed miserably with respect to the Danish People’s Church,\nwhich became predominantly Grundtvigian. His intervention with respect\nto Hegelianism also failed, with Martensen succeeding Mynster as\nBishop Primate. Hegelianism in the church went on to die of natural\ncauses. \nKierkegaard also provided critical commentary on social change. He was\nan untiring champion of “the single individual” as opposed\nto “the crowd”. He feared that the opportunity of\nachieving genuine selfhood was diminished by the social production of\nstereotypes. He lived in an age when mass society was emerging from a\nhighly stratified feudal order and was contemptuous of the mediocrity\nthe new social order generated. One symptom of the change was that\nmass society substitutes detached reflection for engaged passionate\ncommitment. Yet the latter is crucial for Christian faith and for\nauthentic selfhood according to Kierkegaard. \nKierkegaard’s real value as a social and political thinker was\nnot realized until after his death. His pamphleteering achieved little\nimmediate impact, but his substantial philosophical, literary,\npsychological and theological writings have had a lasting effect. Much\nof Heidegger’s very influential work, Being And Time,\nis indebted to Kierkegaard’s writings, especially for its\nphenomenology of moods and its understanding of the constitutive role\nof time in the formation of the subject. Sartre’s equally large\ntome, Being And Nothingness, in which the freedom of the\nindividual becomes the primary concept for social and political\nexplanation, also draws on Kierkegaard. Sartre’s associated\nnotions of authenticity and bad faith, and his assertion that\nexistence precedes essence, also have Kierkegaardian origins. Adorno,\non the other hand, in his Habilitationsschrift, later\npublished as Kierkegaard: Construction of the Aesthetic, is\ncritical of Kierkegaard’s politics, though Adorno’s\nindirect target was Heidegger and existentialism more generally.\nAdorno argues that Kierkegaard’s philosophy of inwardness\nultimately reflects only the bourgeois interior of his time, and that\nKierkegaard falls into the idealism he sought to escape because, like\nthe existentialists, he fails to follow a concrete historical\ndialectic. This results in Kierkegaard’s subject-object\ndialectic positing an abstract self as counterweight to the\nabstractness of the universal. Kierkegaard thereby fails to understand\nthe self in terms of its concrete historical situation and, despite\nhis best intentions, creates a self-contradictory system of existence,\nwhich in turn prepares the ground for Heidegger’s ontology. \nContrary to Adorno’s critique, it could be argued that\nKierkegaard’s writing evinces an astute social realism, evident\nin myriad concrete observations and critical reflections on everyday\nlife and on institutions such as the church, the press, the democratic\nmovement and the women’s movement. This critical social realism,\nalong with his deep psychological and philosophical analyses of\ncontemporary problems, and his concern to address “the present\nage” were taken up by fellow Scandinavians Henrik Ibsen and\nAugust Strindberg. Ibsen and Strindberg, together with Friedrich\nNietzsche, became central icons of the modernism movement in Berlin in\nthe 1890s. The Danish literary critic Georg Brandes was instrumental\nin conjoining these intellectual figures: he had given the first\nuniversity lectures on Kierkegaard and on Nietzsche; he had promoted\nKierkegaard’s work to Nietzsche and to Strindberg; and he had\nput Strindberg in correspondence with Nietzsche. Taking his cue from\nBrandes, the Swedish literary critic Ola Hansson subsequently promoted\nthis conjunction of writers in Berlin itself. Berlin modernism\nself-consciously sought to use art as a means of political and social\nchange. It continued Kierkegaard’s concern to use discursive\naction for social transformation. \nMany other writers have been inspired by Kierkegaard to tackle\nfundamental issues in philosophy, politics, theology and psychology.\nOne major inspiration has been Kierkegaard’s treatment of\nAbraham and the sacrifice of Isaac (the Akkedah). Franz Kafka,\nEmmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida have all written extensively in\nresponse, to try to sort out the implications for ethics and faith.\nGabriel Marcel, Lev Shestov, Paul Tillich, Martin Buber, Gyorgy\nLukacs, Karl Barth, Georges Battaille, Rudolf Bultmann, Karl Jaspers,\nMichel Henry and John D. Caputo have all been influenced by, or\nengaged with, Kierkegaard’s Christian existentialism. Carl\nSchmitt’s political theology uses concepts such as “the\ndecision” and “the exception”, which draw heavily on\nKierkegaard’s concepts of “the moment” and\n“repetition”. Kierkegaard was also an inspiration for the\nearly Wittgenstein, who reportedly said Kierkegaard was “by far\nthe most profound thinker of the [nineteenth] century. Kierkegaard was\na saint.” Subsequent Wittgensteinians, such as Stanley Cavell,\nJames Conant and Cora Diamond, have all engaged with aspects of\nKierkegaard’s work, including how we should understand the\ndistinction between sense and nonsense in the context of claims about\nreligious authority and revelation. Alastair MacIntyre’s reading\nof Kierkegaard in After Virtue and A Short History of\nEthics opened up a vigorous line of inquiry into\nKierkegaard’s relevance for ethics in contemporary analytic\nphilosophy. This has produced quite a debate about the relevance of\nKierkegaard for developing narrative accounts of the self, with\nnotable contributions by Anthony Rudd, John Davenport, John Lippitt\nand Patrick Stokes. Paul Ricoeur and Judith Butler have also been\ninfluenced by Kierkegaard, especially regarding his use of rhetoric\nand narrative point of view to critique systematic philosophy. \nIt is impossible to give an exhaustive list of the important thinkers\nwho owe an intellectual or existential debt to Kierkegaard. The\ndiversity of the writers and thinkers mentioned above nevertheless\ntestifies to the breadth and depth of his influence, which continues\ninto the present age.","contact.mail":"wmcdonal@une.edu.au","contact.domain":"une.edu.au"}]
