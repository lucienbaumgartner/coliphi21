He made important\ncontributions to many fields in philosophy, especially to the\nphilosophy of mind, metaphysics and ontology, ethics, logic, the\nhistory of philosophy, and philosophical theology. Brentano was\nstrongly influenced by Aristotle and the Scholastics as well as by the\nempiricist and positivist movements of the early nineteenth century.\nDue to his introspectionist approach of describing consciousness from\na first person point of view, on one hand, and his rigorous style as\nwell as his contention that philosophy should be done with exact\nmethods like the natural sciences, on the other, Brentano is often\nconsidered a forerunner of both the phenomenological movement and the\ntradition of analytic philosophy. A charismatic teacher, Brentano\nexerted a strong influence on the work of Edmund Husserl, Alexius\nMeinong, Christian von Ehrenfels, Kasimir Twardowski, Carl Stumpf, and\nAnton Marty, among others, and thereby played a central role in the\nphilosophical development of central Europe in the early twentieth\ncentury.\n\nFranz Brentano was born on January 16, 1838 in Marienberg am Rhein,\nGermany, a descendent of a strongly religious German-Italian family of\nintellectuals (his uncle Clemens Brentano and his aunt Bettina von\nArnim were among the most important writers of German Romanticism and\nhis brother Lujo Brentano became a leading expert in social\neconomics). He studied mathematics, poetry, philosophy, and theology\nin Munich, Würzburg, and Berlin. Already at high school he became\nacquainted with Scholasticism; at university he studied Aristotle with\nTrendelenburg in Berlin, and read Comte as well as the British\nEmpiricists (mainly John Stuart Mill), all of whom had a great\ninfluence on his work. Brentano received his Ph.D. from the University\nof Tübingen in 1862, with his thesis On the Several Senses of\nBeing in Aristotle. \nAfter graduation Brentano prepared to take his vows; he was ordained a\nCatholic priest in 1864. Nevertheless he continued his academic career\nat the University of Würzburg, where he presented his\nHabilitationsschrift on The Psychology of Aristotle\nin 1867. Despite reservations in the faculty about his priesthood he\neventually became full professor in 1873. During this period, however,\nBrentano struggled more and more with the official doctrine of the\nCatholic Church, especially with the dogma of papal infallibility,\npromulgated at the first Vatican Council in 1870. Shortly after his\npromotion at the University of Würzburg, Brentano withdrew from\nthe priesthood and from his position as professor. \nAfter his Habilitation, Brentano had started to work on a\nlarge scale work on the foundations of psychology, which he entitled\nPsychology from an Empirical Standpoint. The first volume was\npublished in 1874, a second volume (The Classification of Mental\nPhenomena) followed in 1911, and fragments of the third volume\n(Sensory and Noetic Consciousness) were published\nposthumously by Oskar Kraus in 1928. \nShortly after the publication of the first volume, Brentano took a job\nas a full professor at the University of Vienna, where he continued a\nsuccessful teaching career. During his tenure in Vienna, Brentano, who\nwas very critical towards his own writing, did not pursue his plans to\ncomplete and publish the second and third volumes of his\nPsychology, but preferred to publish shorter texts, most of\nwhich were based on manuscripts for public lectures. The topics range\nfrom aesthetics (Das Genie [The Genius], Das Schlechte\nals Gegenstand dichterischer Darstellung [Evil as Object of\nPoetic Representation]) and issues in historiography to The Origin\nof the Knowledge of Right and Wrong, in which Brentano laid out\nhis views on ethics. The latter was Brentano’s first book to be\ntranslated into English in 1902.  \nWhen in 1880 Brentano and Ida von Lieben decided to wed, they had to\nconfront the fact that the prevailing law in the Austro-Hungarian\nEmpire denied matrimony to persons who had been ordained priests\n– even if they later had resigned from priesthood. They\nsurmounted this obstacle by temporarily moving to and becoming\ncitizens of Saxony, where they finally got married. This was possible\nonly by temporarily giving up the Austrian citizenship and, in\nconsequence, the job as full professor at the University. When\nBrentano came back to Vienna a few months later, the Austrian\nauthorities did not reassign him his position. Brentano became\nPrivatdozent, a status that allowed him to go on teaching\n– but did not entitle him to receive a salary or to supervise\ntheses. For several years he tried in vain to get his position back.\nIn 1895, after the death of his wife, he left Austria disappointed; at\nthis occasion, he published a series of three articles in the Viennese\nnewspaper Die neue freie Presse entitled Meine letzen\nWünsche für Österreich [My Last Wishes for\nAustria] (which soon afterwards appeared as a self-standing book), in\nwhich he outlined his philosophical position as well as his approach\nto psychology, but also harshly criticized the legal situation of\nformer priests in Austria. In 1896 he settled down in Florence where\nhe got married to Emilie Ruprecht in 1897. \nBrentano has often been described as an extraordinarily charismatic\nteacher. Throughout his life he influenced a great number of students,\nmany of who became important philosophers and psychologists in their\nown rights, such as Edmund Husserl, Alexius Meinong, Christian von\nEhrenfels, Anton Marty, Carl Stumpf, Kasimir Twardowski, as well as\nSigmund Freud. Many of his students became professors in different\nparts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Marty and Ehrenfels in Prague,\nMeinong in Graz, and Twardowski in Lvov (now Lviv), and so spread\nBrentanianism over the whole Austro-Hungarian Empire, which explains\nthe central role of Brentano in the philosophical development in\ncentral Europe, especially in what was later called the Austrian\nTradition in philosophy. \nBrentano always emphasized that he meant to teach his students to\nthink critically and in a scientific manner, without holding\nprejudices and paying undue respect to philosophical schools or\ntraditions. When former students of his took a critical approach to\nhis own work, however, when they criticized some of his doctrines and\nmodified others to adapt them for their own goals, Brentano reacted\nbitterly. He often refused to discuss criticism, ignored improvements,\nand thus became more and more isolated, a development that was\nreinforced by his increasing blindness. \nDue to these eye-problems Brentano could not read or write any longer,\nbut had his wife read to him and dictated his work to her.\nNonetheless, he produced a number of books in his years in Florence.\nIn 1907 he published Untersuchungen zur Sinnespsychologie, a\ncollection of shorter texts on psychology. In 1911 he presented not\nonly the second volume of his Psychology from an Empirical\nStandpoint, but also two books on Aristotle: in Aristotle and\nhis World View he provides an outline and interpretation of\nAristotle’s philosophy. In Aristoteles Lehre vom Ursprung\ndes menschlichen Geistes Brentano continues a debate with Zeller.\nThis debate had started already in the 1860s, when Brentano criticized\nZeller’s interpretation of Aristotle in his Psychology of\nAristotle and became quite intense and aggressive in the\nseventies and eighties of the nineteenth century. \nWhen Italy entered war against Germany and Austria during World War I,\nBrentano, who felt himself a citizen of all three countries, moved\nfrom Florence to neutral Switzerland. He passed away in Zurich on\nMarch 17, 1917. \nBrentano left a huge number of unpublished manuscripts, including\npoetry and letters on a wide range of philosophical topics in his last\ndomicile in Zürich and in his summer-residence in\nSchönbühel bei Melk; some manuscripts were probably left\nbehind in Florence. After his death, Alfred Kastil and Oskar Kraus, who\nwere students of Brentano’s former student Anton Marty in\nPrague, worked on the Nachlass, transferring a good part of it\nto Innsbruck. Their attempt to set up a Brentano-archive was supported\nby Tomas Masaryk, a former student of Brentano who had become founder\nand first President (from 1918 to 1935) of the Republic of\nCzechoslovakia. As a result, in 1932 many of the original manuscripts\nwere moved to Prague where an archive was founded. Alas, due to the\npolitical turbulences that were to came over central Europe the\nproject made it necessary to transfer the archive again. Substantial\nparts of the Nachlass were transferred to different places in\nthe United States, some of it has later been brought back to Europe,\nespecially to the Brentano-Forschungsstelle at the University of Graz,\nAustria, and the Brentano family archive in Blonay, Switzerland. (For\na detailed history of Brentano’s Nachlass, cf. Binder\n(2013)).  \nKastil and Kraus did succeed, however, to begin to publish\nposthumously some of the lecture notes, letters, and drafts he had\nleft. They tried to present Brentano’s work as best as they\ncould, putting together various texts to what they thought were\nrounded, convincing works, sometimes following questionable editorial\ncriteria. Their work was continued by other, more careful editors, but\nhas by far not yet been completed: a much needed critical edition of\nhis complete œuvre is still to be waited for. \nA central principle of Brentano’s philosophy, which should\nbecome widely accepted among Brentano’s students, was that\nphilosophy should be done in a rigorous, scientific manner. Already\nearly in his career, in the public defense of his\nHabilitation in 1866, he stated 25 theses, the fourth of\nwhich reads: “The true method of philosophy is that of natural\nscience.” (contained in: ZP, 136, my translation)\n[“Verae philosophiae methodus nihil alia est nisi scientiae\nnaturarum”]. Brentano, thus, opposed the idea that there\nwas a unique method for philosophy and denied that there was a\n“first philosophy” that could unveil genuinely\nphilosophical truths and thus play a privileged or foundational role\nin the overall system of the sciences. According to Brentano,\nphilosophy—and in particular philosophical\npsychology—should apply a method that is based on observation,\ndescription of facts, and induction; just like the (other) natural\nsciences. \nIt has been suggested that Brentano’s fourth\nHabilitations-thesis makes him an advocate of a particular\nversion of the unity of the sciences, according to which there is a\nunity of method (cf. Haller 1993, 27) and that it stands in contrast\nto “Dilthey’s view according to which the so-called\nGeisteswissenschaften or human or moral sciences would\nsomehow call for a special method of ‘understanding’ or\nVerstehen, as opposed to the ‘explanation’ of the\nnatural sciences.” (Smith 1994, 31). One has to be cautious not\nto overstate this point, though. While it is true that Brentano uses\nboth the terms “method” [methodus] and\n“natural science” [scientiae naturarum] in the\nsingular, there is strong evidence that he had a minimal understanding\nof what this method should exactly consist in. He never suggested that\nall scientific disciplines could be reduced to other, more basic\ndisciplines, nor did he argue that all natural sciences should apply\nexactly the same method, nor that mathematization or the use of a\nformal language was indispensable for scientificity. For Brentano, a\nmethod counts as scientific as long as it fulfills the minimal\nrequirements of applying observation, description of facts, and\ninduction. The specific methodological procedures applied in a given\nscientific discipline depend first and foremost on the objects\nstudied: \nRegarding formal methods he states: “Mathematical analysis,\nwhich is the main means of scientific progress in some areas of\nnatural science, does not play nearly any role at all in\nothers.” (ZK 35, my translation) [“Die\nmathematische Analyse, die auf manchem Gebiet der Naturwissenschaft\ndas hauptsächliche Mittel des Fortschritt ist, spielt darum\nbekanntlich auf anderen so gut wie gar keine Rolle.”]\nBrentano has never made an attempt to introduce formal or mathematical\nmethods in philosophy or psychology. On the contrary, he criticized\nJohann Friedrich Herbart’s attempts to mathematize psychology,\npointing out that Herbart’s mathematical deductions lack\nempirical foundation and therefore lose contact to the actual\nphenomena (cf. LW, 36). In another place where he discusses\nHerbart’s position, he states: “Alas, many believed that\nwhere there is so much mathematical rigour, there must be exact\nscience” (GA, 53f, my translation). [“Leider\nmeinten viele, wo so viel mathematische Strenge zu finden sei,\nmüsse exakte Wissenschaft gegeben sein.”] For\nBrentano, any rigorous, scientific method had to be appropriate for\nthe observed phenomena; his position, thus, is closer to classical\nempiricism and positivism than to the logical positivism as it was\ndeveloped in Vienna a decade after his death. \nBrentano’s views concerning the right method in philosophy was\nof particular importance to his contributions to psychology, as\nalready the title of his main work, Psychology from an Empirical\nStandpoint suggests. Also there he argued that the right\nprocedure consisted in observing and describing the relevant phenomena\nand establishing the general laws on the basis of induction. The\nparticularity of Brentano’s method lies in the fact that\npsychology is based mainly on observation that is performed from a\nfirst person point of view. The psychologist draws on the intimate\nknowledge concerning her own current mental phenomena that she gains\nthrough inner perception (which, as we shall see below, is to be\ndistinguished from inner observation). Brentano does not suggest,\nhowever, that these descriptions are infallible: as it is impossible\nto live and describe a particular experience at the same time, all\ndescriptions of mental phenomena have to rely on memory and inner\nobservation. \nMoreover, as inner perception and memory as sources of experience are\nlimited to one’s own mental life, they have to be complemented\nwith the “indirect knowledge of the mental phenomena of\nothers” [“indirekte Erkenntnis fremder psychischer\nPhänomene”], which we can gain on the basis of the manifest\nbehavior we can observe in others, including their verbal behavior,\ni.e., when “a person describes them directly in words.”\n(PES 28) [“jemand geradezu in Worten sie\nbeschreibt”] (PES 53).  \nBrentano’s approach, like that of other introspectionist\npsychologists of the late nineteenth century, was harshly criticized\nwith the rise of scientific psychology in the tradition of logical\npositivism, especially by behaviorists, who argue that empirical\npsychology must not make use of introspection, but only of data that\ncan be obtained by the observation of the manifest behaviour of human\nbeings from a third-person point of view. This should not obscure the\nfact that Brentano did play a crucial role in the process of\npsychology becoming an independent science. He distinguished between\ngenetic and empirical or, as he called it,\ndescriptive psychology, a distinction that is most explicitly\ndrawn in lecture notes form the mid-1880s that have been published in\nDescriptive Psychology (DP). Genetic psychology\nstudies psychological phenomena from a third-person point of view. It\ninvolves the use of experiments and thus satisfies the scientific\nstandards we nowadays expect of an empirical science. Even though\nBrentano never conducted psychological experiments in laboratories, he\nvery actively supported the installation of the first laboratories for\nexperimental psychology in the Austro-Hungarian Empire – a goal\nthat was achieved by his student Alexius Meinong in Graz. Descriptive\npsychology (to which Brentano sometimes also referred\nas “phenomenology” (cf. DP 137)) aims at\ndescribing consciousness from a first-person point of view. Its goal\nis to list “fully the basic components out of which everything\ninternally perceived by humans is composed, and … [to\nenumerate] the ways in which these components can be connected”\n(DP 4). Brentano’s distinction between genetic and\ndescriptive psychology strongly influenced Husserl’s development\nof the phenomenological method, especially in its early phases. But\nalready then Brentano could not approve of Husserl’s development\nfor it involved the intuition of abstract essences, the existence of\nwhich Brentano denied. With his so-called “transcendental\nturn” in the mid of the first decade of the twentieth century,\nHusserl alienated himself more and more from the Brentanian roots of\nthe phenomenological method. \nBrentano’s main goal was to lay the basis for a scientific\npsychology, which he defines as “the science of mental\nphenomena” (PES, 14) [“Wissenschaft von den\npsychischen Erscheinungen”]. In order to give flesh to this\ndefinition of the discipline, he provides a more detailed\ncharacterization of mental phenomena. He proposes six criteria to\ndistinguish mental from physical phenomena (PES 61–77),\nthe most important of which are: (i) mental phenomena are the\nexclusive object of inner perception, (ii) they always appear\nas a unity, and (iii) they are always intentionally directed\ntowards an object. (The other three criteria are: psychological\nphenomena – and only those – are presentations or\nphenomena based upon presentations; they seem to have no spatial\nextension; and have not only intentional, but also actual existence.)\nI will discuss the first two criteria in the next sub-section, and the\nthird in a separate sub-section below.  \nAll mental phenomena have in common, Brentano argues, “that they\nare only perceived in inner consciousness, while in the case of\nphysical phenomena only external perception is possible”\n(PES, 70) [“daß sie nur in innerem\nBewußtsein wahrgenommen werden, während bei den physischen\nnur äußere Wahrnehmung möglich ist.”\n(PES 128)]. According to Brentano, the former of these two\nforms of perception provides an unmistakable evidence for what is\ntrue. Since the German word for perception (Wahrnehmung),\nliterally translated, means “taking-true”, Brentano says\nthat it is the only kind of perception in a strict sense. He points\nout that inner perception must not be mixed up with inner observation,\nwhich would require that one is having a mental act, the act of\nobserving, that is directed towards another mental act, the act\nobserved. Inner perception, on the other hand, must not be conceived\nas a full-fledged act that accompanies another mental act towards\nwhich it is directed. It is rather interwoven with the latter: in\naddition to being primarily directed towards an object, every mental\nact is incidentally directed towards itself as a secondary\nobject. When I see a tree, for example, the primary object of my\nvisual experience is the tree. But I am also aware that I am\nseeing and not, say, hearing or touching the tree; I am, in\nother words, aware of the fact that I have a mental phenomenon that is\ndirected towards the tree. This is possible because one and the same\nmental phenomenon, my visual experience, is directed not only towards\nits primary object, the tree, it is incidentally directed\nalso towards itself as a secondary object.  \nAccording to Brentano, every mental phenomenon is directed\ntowards itself as a secondary object; inner perception is, thus, a\nform of mechanism on the basis of which we become aware of our own\nmental phenomena. \nAs a consequence, Brentano denies the idea that there could be\nunconscious mental acts: since every mental act is\nincidentally directed towards itself as a secondary object, we are\nautomatically aware of every occurring mental act. He admits, however,\nthat we can have mental acts of various degrees of intensity. In\naddition, he holds that the degree of intensity with which the object\nis presented is equal to the degree of intensity in which the\nsecondary object, i.e., the act itself, is presented. Consequently, if\nwe have a mental act of a very low intensity, our inner perception of\nthe act or, as he puts it, our secondary consciousness of it will also\nhave a very low intensity. From this Brentano concludes that sometimes\nwe are inclined to say that we had an unconscious mental phenomenon\nwhen actually we had a conscious mental phenomenon of very low\nintensity. \nConsciousness, Brentano argues, always forms a unity. While we can\nperceive a number of physical phenomena at one and the same time, we\ncan only perceive one mental phenomenon at a specific point in time.\nWhen we seem to have more than one mental act at a time, like when we\nare listening to a melody while tasting a sip of red wine and enjoying\nthe beautiful view from the window, all these mental phenomena melt\ninto one, they become moments or, to stick with Brentano’s\nterminology, divisives of a collective. If one of the divisives ends\nin the course of time, e.g., when I swallow the wine and turn my eyes\nto the fireplace, but continue to listen to the music, the collective\ngoes on to exist. Brentano’s views on the unity of consciousness\nentail that inner observation, as explained above, is strictly\nimpossible, for this would require us to have two distinct acts in the\nvery same moment. Of course it is possible to remember\nanother mental act one had a moment ago, or expect future mental acts,\nbut due to the unity of consciousness one cannot have two distinct\nmental acts, one of which being directed towards the other, at the\nsame time. \nThe fact that we can be directed towards one and the same object in\ndifferent ways allows Brentano to introduce a classification of mental\nphenomena. He distinguishes three basic kinds: presentations,\njudgments, and emotions (which he refers to as “phenomena of\nlove and hate”). These are not three completely distinct\nclasses, though. Presentations are the most basic kind of acts; we\nhave a presentation each time when we are directed towards an object,\nbe it that we are imagining, seeing, remembering, or expecting it,\netc. In his Psychology Brentano held that two presentations\ncan differ only in the object, towards which they are directed. Later\nhe modified his position, though, and argued that they can also differ\nin various modes, such as temporal modes (cf. PES 217 [This\ntext is part of the appendix to the second part of PES from\n1911 – for the German original cf. PES, vol II, 142]). The two\nother categories, judgments and phenomena of love and hate, are based\non presentations. In a judgment we accept or deny the existence of the\npresented object. A judgment, thus, is a presentation plus a\nqualitative mode of acceptance or denial. The third category, which\nBrentano names “phenomena of love and hate,”\ncomprises emotions, feelings, desires and acts of will. In these acts\nwe have positive or negative feelings or attitudes towards an object.\n \nBrentano’s tripartition of mental phenomena is a basic element\nof his theory that remained central for his whole life. The fact that\nhe saw himself constrained to make minor adjustments shows that\nBrentano did approach philosophy in a very systematic manner and\nalways had the bigger picture in mind. It can, thus, be taken as\nevidence that “in his mind Brentano was continuously refining\nand chiseling away at a unified system, a system that harmonized and\nstabilized the bits and pieces in his messy literary state”\n(Kriegel 2017a, 29).  \nMoreover, his conception of secondary consciousness, in combination\nwith this thesis of the unity of consciousness have had a strong echo\nin the philosophy of mind, in particular in the recent debate\nconcerning the nature of consciousness. It has been suggested that\nBrentano’s notion of secondary consciousness (i.e., the thesis\nthat every mental phenomenon is incidentally directed also towards\nitself as a secondary object) can provide the means to overcome\nhigher-order theories of consciousness that have been widely discussed\nin the late twentieth century. In this debate, the exact reading of\nBrentano’s thesis was often at stake. Some philosophers have\nsuggested that Brentano’s view, according to which every mental\nphenomenon is object of inner perception, was an early expression of a\nhigher-order perception theory of consciousness (cf., for example,\nGüzeldere 1997, 789). This interpretation, however, does not pay\ndue attention to the fact that according to Brentano, inner perception\nis not a self-standing mental phenomenon of a higher level, but rather\na structural moment of every mental phenomenon. Moreover,\nwith his unity of consciousness thesis Brentano explicitly rejects the\nbasic assumption of all higher-order perception theories of\nconsciousness, i.e., the idea that we can have two mental phenomena\n(of distinct levels) at the same time, one of them being directed\ntowards the other: higher-order perception theories postulate what\nBrentano calls ‘inner observation’ (as opposed to inner\nperception), which according to him was impossible, as we have seen\nabove.  \nAccordingly, a number of recent interpreters have suggested that\nBrentano was an advocate of a one-level account of consciousness:\n“Since the features that make an act conscious are firmly\nlocated within the act itself rather than bestowed on it by a second\nact, this locates Brentano’s view as a one-level view of\nconsciousness” (Thomasson, 2000, 192). This reading has given\nplace to neo-Brentanian theories such as Thomasson’s adverbial\naccount (cf. Thomasson 2000) or self-representational approaches (cf.,\nfor example, Kriegel 2003a, b) that build on the thesis that\n“every conscious state has a dual representational content. Its\nmain content is the normal content commonly attributed to mental\nrepresentations. But it also has a (rather peripheral) special\ncontent, namely, its own occurrence” (Kriegel 2003a, 480), which\nthey take as Brentano’s central thesis. Moreover, Kriegel\nsuggests that for Brentano this self-representational aspect is a\nnecessary condition for having a presentation (Kriegel 2013).  \nOther interprets have taken more cautious lines. Mark Textor (2006),\nfor example, has stressed the ties between Brentano’s notion of\nsecondary consciousness and his thesis of the unity of consciousness.\nA mental phenomenon, according to Textor’s interpretation of\nBrentano’s theory, does not become conscious by representing\nitself, but rather by its being unified or fused with an\nimmediately evident cognition of it. Dan Zahavi, on the other hand,\nhas insisted that Brentano does distinguish two levels of perception,\nwhich sheds doubts on the one-level interpretation: “It could be\nargued that Brentano’s claim that every conscious intentional\nstate takes two objects, a primary (external) object and secondary\n(internal) object, remains committed to a higher-order account of\nconsciousness; it simply postulates it as being implicitly contained\nin every conscious state” (Zahavi, 2006, 5). In short,\nBrentano’s distinction between primary and secondary\nconsciousness “introduces some kind of level-distinction into\nthe structure of experience” (Brandl 2013, 61) but does not\nconceive of higher-perception as a full-fledged mental phenomenon at\nits own, which is why Brandl has recently proposed to regard it a\n‘one-and-a-half-level theory’ (Brandl 2013, 61f). \nWhile the debate concerning the exact interpretation of his views\nconcerning secondary consciousness is still open, it underlines the\nrelevance of Brentano’s contributions to contemporary philosophy\nof mind.  \nBrentano is probably best known for having introduced the notion of\nintentionality to contemporary philosophy. He first characterizes this\nnotion with the following words, which have become the classical,\nalbeit not completely unambiguous formulation of the intentionality\nthesis:  \n“Every mental phenomenon is characterized by what the\nScholastics of the Middle Ages called the intentional (or mental)\ninexistence of an object, and what we might call, though not wholly\nunambiguously, reference to a content, direction toward an object\n(which is not to be understood here as meaning a thing), or immanent\nobjectivity. Every mental phenomenon includes something as object\nwithin itself...” (Brentano PES, 68)\n\n[“Jedes psychische Phänomen ist durch das\ncharakterisiert, was die Scholastiker des Mittelalters die\nintentionale (auch wohl mentale) Inexistenz eines Gegenstandes genannt\nhaben, und was wir, obwohl mit nicht ganz unzweideutigen\nAusdrücken, die Beziehung auf einen Inhalt, die Richtung auf ein\nObjekt (worunter hier nicht eine Realität zu verstehen ist), oder\ndie immanente Gegenständlichkeit nennen würden. Jedes\nenthält etwas als Objekt in sich…” (Brentano,\nPES 124f)] \nThis quotation must be understood in context: in this passage,\nBrentano aims at providing one (of six) criteria to distinguish mental\nfrom physical phenomena with the aim to define the subject matter of\nscientific psychology – and not to develop a systematic account\nof intentionality. The passage clearly suggests, however, that the\nintentional object towards which we are directed is part of the\npsychological act. It is something mental rather than physical.\nBrentano, thus, seems to advocate a form of immanentism, according to\nwhich the intentional object is “in the head,” as it were.\nSome Brentano scholars have recently argued that this immanent reading\nof the intentionality thesis is too strong. In the light of other\ntexts by Brentano from the same period they argue that he\ndistinguishes between intentional correlate and object, and that the\nexistence of the latter does not depend on our being directed towards\nit. \nWhen Brentano’s students took up his notion of\nintentionality to develop more systematic accounts, they often\ncriticized it for its unclarity regarding the ontological status of\nthe intentional object: if the intentional object is part of the act,\nit was argued, we are faced with a duplication of the object. Next to\nthe real, physical object, which is perceived, remembered, thought of,\netc., we have a mental, intentional object, towards which the act is\nactually directed. Thus, when I think about the city of Paris, I am\nactually thinking of a mental object that is part of my act of\nthinking, and not about the actual city. This view leads to obvious\ndifficulties, the most disastrous of which is that two persons can\nnever be directed towards one and the same object. \nIf we try to resolve the problem by taking the intentional object to\nbe identical with the real object, on the other hand, we face the\ndifficulty of explaining how we can have mental phenomena that are\ndirected towards non-existing objects such as Hamlet, the golden\nmountain, or a round square. Like my thinking about the city of Paris,\nall these acts are intentionally directed towards an object, with the\ndifference, however, that their objects do not really exist. \nBrentano’s initial formulation of the intentionality-thesis does\nnot address these problems concerning the ontological status of the\nintentional object. The first attempt of Brentano’s students to\novercome these difficulties was made by Twardowski, who distinguished\nbetween content and object of the act, the former of which is immanent\nto the act, the latter not (cf. Twardowski 1977). This distinction\nstrongly influenced other members of the Brentano School, mainly the\ntwo students for who the notion of intentionality had the most central\nplace, Meinong and Husserl. \nMeinong’s theory of objects can best be understood as a reaction\nto the ontological difficulties in Brentano’s account. Rather\nthan accepting the notion of an immanent content, Meinong argues that\nthe intentional relation is always a relation between the mental act\nand an object. In some cases the intentional object does not exist,\nbut even in these cases there is an object external to the mental act\ntowards which we are directed. According to Meinong, even non-existent\nobjects are in some sense real. Since we can be intentionally directed\ntowards them, they must subsist (bestehen). Not all\nsubsisting objects exist; some of them cannot even exist for they are\nlogically impossible, such as round squares (cf. Meinong 1981). The\nnotion of intentionality played a central role also in Husserlian\nphenomenology. Applying his method of the phenomenological reduction,\nhowever, Husserl addresses the problem of directedness with his notion\nof ‘noema’ as intentional correlate of the act (for a more\ndetailed discussion, cf. the entry on\n Husserl).\n  \nBrentano was not very fond of his students’ attempts to resolve\nthese difficulties, mainly because he rejected their underlying\nontological assumptions. He was quick to point out that he never\nintended the intentional object to be immanent to the act. Brentano\nthought that this interpretation of his position was obviously absurd,\nfor it would be “paradoxical to the extreme to say that a man\npromises to marry an ens rationis and fulfills his promise by\nmarrying a real person” (PES, 299). In later texts, he\ntherefore suggested to see intentionality as an exceptional form of\nrelation. A mental act does not stand in an ordinary relation to an\nobject, but in a quasi-relation (Relativliches). For a\nrelation to exist, both relata have to exist. A person a is\ntaller than another person b, for example, only if both\na and b exist (and a is, in fact, taller\nthan b). This does not hold for the intentional\nquasi-relation, Brentano suggests. A mental phenomenon can stand in a\nquasi-relation to an object independently of whether it exists or not.\nMental acts, thus, can stand in a quasi-relation to existing objects\nlike the city of Paris as well as non-existing objects like the Golden\nMountain. Brentano’s later account, which is closely related to\nhis later metaphysics, especially to his turn towards reism, i.e., the\nview that only individual objects exist, can hardly be considered a\nsolution of the problem of the ontological status of the intentional\nobject. He rather introduces a new term to reformulate the\ndifficulties. \nAccording to Brentano’s thesis of the unity of consciousness, we\ncan have only one mental phenomenon at a time. Next to this synchronic\nunity, however, there is also a diachronic unity of consciousness: my\npresent mental phenomenon and the one I had just a moment or a few\nminutes ago form a unity as well. This becomes particularly evident\nwhen we consider cases in which we are intentionally directed towards\ntemporally extended objects such as melodies, movies, or goals in a\nsoccer game. \nBrentano regards time as a continuum of which only one point, the\npresent moment, is real. As a consequence, mental phenomena do not\nhave temporal extension (very much like like mathematical points on a\nline). The question, now, is: how can mental phenomena, which do not\nhave any temporal extension, be directed towards objects that are\nextended in time? Can we be directed towards the melody, or only\ntowards a (very small) temporal part of it? Brentano solves this\nproblem by arguing that the object of a presentation does not vanish\nimmediately from consciousness in the moment the presentation is over,\nit is rather retained in consciousness for a short while. In order to\nexplain this process, he introduces the notion of “original\nassociation” or “proteraesthesis”, which, as de\nWarren suggests, “occupies a notable place in the list of\nBrentano’s conceptual innovations; in contrast to other\ndistinguishing concepts of descriptive psychology ... it is without\nprecedence in the history of philosophy” (De Warren 2009,\n57f). \nBrentano has reflected on time consciousness throughout his life, but\nhas never given a systematic exposition of his position that would\ngive it a static form. Rather, he has changed his position several\ntimes, often to accommodate it to changes in his overall views. Based\non the testimonies of his students and manuscripts contained in the\nNachlass, we can distinguish different phases of\nBrentano’s views on time-consciousness (cf. Fréchette\n2017). \nAccording to his early view, time consciousness depends on\nthe mode of judgment. I can be intentionally directed towards a past\nobject if I judge (correctly) that, say, “Caesar was stabbed on\nthe Ides of March, 44 B.C.”. The reason for characterising\ntemporal differences as modes of judgments is probably the fact that\nin language we express these temporal differences with the tense of\nthe verb (past, present, future) – but the verb also serves to\nexpress our accepting or denying the existence of an object in a\njudgment. \nIn his second phase, which he held from the early 1870s to\nthe early 1890s, Brentano introduced the notion of original\nassociation. A mental phenomenon does not disappear from consciousness\nfrom one moment to another, it is rather retained for a short period\nof time. When I hear a melody a, b, c,\nd, for example, I first hear a. When, in a second\nmoment, I hear b, a still persists in my\nconsciousness, but is modified as “past”. When, another\nmoment later, I hear c, both b and a are\nretained in original association; now also b is given as\n“past”, while a is “pushed back” even\nfurther into the past, as it were, etc. In this way, Brentano can\nexplain how the melody (as a whole) can be the intentional object of a\nmental phenomenon: in each moment, the present and the (very) recent\ntones are given, but the latter are not given in the same way (or else\nwe would not hear a melody, but we would hear all the tones at once;\nwe would, in other words, not hear a melody, but a cacophony). The\ntones that are past are given with temporal modifications –\nwhich do not further determine them, but rather modify their\nontological status from real to not real. In this period Brentano\nholds that two presentations can differ only in the object towards\nwhich they are directed; the continuously changing temporal moment,\nthus, is a modification of the objects. An object that sinks back into\nthe past undergoes, according to this view, continuous\nmodifications. \nIn the early 1890s Brentano modifies his views again, suggesting that\nthe temporal modification is not a modification of the content, but of\nthe attitude of acknowledgement in judgments. With this change,\nBrentano avoids problems of his earlier view: he no longer needs to\nsuggest that temporal modifications are parts of the intentional\nobjects that are given in original associations, nor does he need to\nexplain how the real, present object can form a continuum with the\npast objects that are not real. \nIn later years, Brentano makes further changes to his theory of\ntime-consciousness. Since temporal modifications can be observed also\nin mental phenomena that do not contain a judgment (for example when\none imagines vividly hearing a melody), he gives up his view that two\npresentations can differ only in their intentional object and allows\nfor modes of presentation – such as temporal modes. Finally, in\na late manuscript that was dictated in 1915, Brentano introduces\nanother minor modification of his theory, suggesting that past objects\ncan be presented only in modo obliquo, while present objects\nare presented in modo recto. \nBrentano’s reflections on time-consciousness illustrate very\nwell his way of doing philosophy, but also the way in which his views\nhave had an influence on others. As Oskar Kraus notes in his\nRecollections (cf. Kraus 1919, 39), Brentano has vividly\nengaged with the problem of time and the origins of time consciousness\nthroughout his life. He presented it several times to students in\nclass and discussed i in letters with colleagues at different moments\nin time. He never presented a systematic exposition of his views in\npublication, though. As a result, Brentano’s views on the topic\nwere very dynamic, as he did not hesitate to revise them when he\nencountered problems or when changes in other parts of his overall\ntheory made it necessary. As he never published a systematic statement\nof his views on time-consciousness, interested scholars could learn\nabout it only from the expositions of Brentano’s students like\nCarl Stumpf, Anton Marty, and in particular Edmund Husserl who,\nhowever, used Brentano’s views as departing point for their own\nreflections, very often in an attempt to overcome the difficulties\ninherent to the version of Brentano’s theory they were\nacquainted with. Brentano’s own views were, thus, very\ninfluential, but risked to become eclipsed by the contributions of his\nstudents, who further developed them.  \nAccording to Brentano, psychology plays a central role in the\nsciences; he considers especially logics, ethics, and aesthetics as\npractical disciplines that depend on psychology as their theoretical\nfoundation. He collocates these three disciplines in his larger\nsystematic outlook by tying them to the three kinds of mental\nphenomenon: presentations, judgments, and phenomena of love and hate,\ni.e., emotions. The “triad of the Beautiful, the\nTrue, and the Good ... [is] related to the three\naspects of our mental life” (PES, 203). Moreover, the\nthree disciplines essentially build on his views that presentations\nare intrinsically valuable and that not only judgments, but also\nemotions can be correct or not correct.  \nLogic, according to Brentano, is the practical discipline that is\nconcerned with judgments; i.e. with the class of mental phenomena in\nwhich we take a positive or a negative stance towards the (existence\nof the) object by affirming or denying it. In addition, judgments are\ncorrect or not; they have a truth-value. According to Brentano, a\njudgment is true when it is evident, i.e., when one perceives (in\ninner perception that is directed towards the judgment) that one\njudges with evidence. Brentano, thus, rejects the correspondence\ntheory of truth, suggesting that “a person judges truly, if and\nonly if, his judgment agrees with the judgment he would make if we\nwere to judge with evidence” (Chisholm 1986, 38).\nNotwithstanding this dependence on the notion of judgment, however,\ntruth, for Brentano, is not a subjective notion: if one person affirms\nan object and another person denies the same object, only one of them\njudges correctly. (For a more detailed discussion of Brentano’s\ncontributions to logic, cf. the entry\n Brentano’s Theory of Judgement.) \nEthics, on the other hand, is concerned with emotions or, as Brentano\ncalls them, phenomena of love and hate. Brentano sees a structural\nanalogy between judgments and phenomena of this class: just like\njudgments, that are either affirmative or negative, also emotions\nconsist in taking a positive or a negative (emotional) attitude\ntowards an object: love or hate, inclination and disinclination, being\npleased and being displeased, etc. Moreover, just as (positive and\nnegative) judgments can be correct or incorrect, Brentano holds that\nalso (both positive and negative) emotions can be correct or\nincorrect. An emotion is correct, according to Brentano, “when\none’s feelings are adequate to their object — adequate in\nthe sense of being appropriate, suitable, or fitting”\n(ORW, 70). [“Wer richtig liebt und haßt,\ndessen Gemüt verhält sich den Gegenständen\nadäquat, d.h. es verhält sich konvenient, passend,\nentsprechend” (USE, 76)]  \nIf it is correct to love an object, we can say that it is good; if it\nis correct to hate it, it is bad: \nNot any experience of pleasure is taken into consideration, one needs\nsome sort of evidence that the pleasure is correct. Brentano\ncharacterizes the relevant form of pleasure with the following words:\n“it is a pleasure of the highest form; it is thus the analogue of\nsomething being evident in the sphere of judgment”\n(ORW, 22) [“Es ist ein Gefallen von jener\nhöheren Form die das Analogon ist von der Evidenz auf dem Gebiet\ndes Urteils” (USE 21)]. In this way Brentano avoids a\nsubjectivist position. While it is true that correct pleasure is an\nemotion experienced by subjects, it is impossible that one person can\nevidently and correctly love an object and another correctly and\nevidently hate it. In some cases, pleasure or love might be misguided\nby our prejudices, instincts or habits.  \nBrentano presented his reflections on ethics in a lecture in 1889. The\nmanuscript was published as a short monograph in the same year, an\nEnglish translation had appeared as early as 1902 and was, for a long\ntime, the only text by Brentano available in English. This might\nexplain why Brentano’s views on ethics have received more\nattention in English speaking countries than in central Europe. In\nparticular, Brentano’s basic insight that moral and aesthetic\nvalue are related to attitudes we take towards objects and that these\nlatter attitudes can be correct or incorrect, have had a revival in\nrecent years, as it has inspired\n fitting attitude theories of value.\n  \nAesthetics, finally, is based on the most basic class of mental\nphenomena: on presentations. According to Brentano, every presentation\nis in itself of value; this holds even for those that become the basis\nof a correct, negative judgment or emotion.  \nThus, while judgments and emotions consist in taking either a positive\nor a negative stance, the value of a presentation is always positive,\nbut comes in degrees: some presentations are of higher value than\nothers. Not every presentations is of particular aesthetic value,\nthough; in order to be so, it has to become the object of an emotion\nin which one correctly takes a positive stance towards it. In short,\naccording to Brentano, an object is beautiful if a presentation that\nis directed at it arouses a correct, positive emotion, i.e., a form of\npleasure; it is ugly, on the other hand, if a presentation that is\ndirected at it arouses a correct, negative emotion, a form of\ndispleasure.  \nLike secondary qualities, the aesthetic value is not an intrinsic\nproperty of the object but rather depends on the way we experience it.\nWe tend to attribute beauty to the objects of experience, but strictly\nspeaking, the experienced objects are neither beautiful nor ugly: \nEven though Brentano’s views on ethics and aesthetics are\nsomewhat sketchy and not worked out in detail, we can note that his\ntreatment of the three practical disciplines of logics, ethics, and\naesthetics are unified by a common principle: the idea that judgments\nor emotions not only can be positive or negative, they can also be\nfitting or appropriate to their object. Moreover, by tying the three\ndisciplines to his tripartition of mental phenomena (presentations,\njudgments, emotions), he also assigns them an exact collocation in his\noverall philosophical system. For these reasons, recent commentators\nhave insisted in the systematicity of Brentano’s philosophy,\narguing that he “was the last philosopher to have offered a\nsystem in the sense of a structurally unified account of the true, the\ngood, and the beautiful.” (Kriegel 2017a, 29). Kriegel\nacknowledges, however, that “Brentano was not a systematic\nwriter” (ibid., 21). This shows in the fact that\nBrentano saw his task mainly in sketching the basic views on\naesthetics and ethics in lectures, but never presented a longer or\nsystematic treatise of these topics, which can be explained by his\nconviction that science was a collective enterprise and by his\naversion of the cult of the genius that was widespread in his times.\nBrentano probably hoped that others would continue to work out the\ndetails within the parameters he had set. We know about his views on\naesthetics and ethics only from lecture notes that have been cut,\nrevised, and amended by his students, who typically did not bother to\ndocument their substantial editorial changes in the published text.\nMoreover, Brentano never presented his philosophical position as a\nsystem, probably because he did not want to be associated with German\nsystem philosophers of the early and mid-nineteenth century. Thus, the\nclaim that Brentano was a system-philosopher is somewhat questionable,\nthough he definitely was a systematic thinker in the sense that he\nalways kept the overall picture in mind when working on a specific\nproblem.  \nThe discussion of Brentano’s views on logic, ethics and\naesthetics shows that his philosophy has strong psychologistic\ntendencies. Whether or not one is to conclude that he does adopt a\nform of psychologism depends on the exact definition of the latter\nterm: Brentano vehemently rejects the charge of psychologism, which he\ntakes to stand for a subjectivist and anthropocentric position. At the\nsame time, however, he explicitly defends the claim that psychology is\nthe theoretical science on which practical disciplines of logic,\nethics, and aesthetics are based. In LW he explicitly notes\nthat, like all other philosophical disciplines, also aesthetics is\nrooted in psychology and continues: “And similarly one could\nshow for aesthetics and any other philosophical discipline that\nseparated from psychology it would have to wither like a branch that\nis detached from the trunk.” (LW, 39 [my translation])\n[“Und ähnlich ließe sich für die Aesthetik\nund jede andere Disciplin der Philosophie aufs leichteste nachweisen,\ndaß sie, losgetrennt von der Psychologie, wie ein vom Stamm\nlosgetrennter Zweig verdorren müsste.”] Hence,\nBrentano does adopt the form of psychologism Husserl seems to have had\nin mind in the Prolegomena to his Logical\nInvestigations, where he defines logical psychologism as a\nposition according to which: \n… [T]he essential theoretical foundations of logic lie in\npsychology, in whose field those propositions belong — as far as\ntheir theoretical content is concerned — which give logic its\ncharacteristic pattern. … Often people talk as if psychology\nprovided the sole, sufficient, theoretical foundation for logical\npsychology (Husserl 2001, 40).\n\n[Die wesentlichen theoretischen Fundamente liegen in der\nPsychologie; in deren Gebiet gehören ihrem theoretischen Gehalt\nnach die Sätze, die der Logik ihr charakteristisches Gepräge\ngeben. … Ja nicht selten spricht man so, als gäbe die\nPsychologie das alleinige und ausreichende theoretische Fundament\nfür die logische Kunstlehre. (Husserl, 1900, 51)] \nBrentano’s tendency to offer psychological explanations is shown\nalso in his approach to the history of philosophy, in particular in\nhis explanations of the mechanisms that explain the historical\ndevelopment in this discipline. In his text The Four Phases of\nPhilosophy and Its Current State (1998) he defended the\nmetaphilosophical thesis that progress in philosophy can be explained\naccording to principles of cultural psychology. According to Brentano,\nphilosophical progress takes place in circles. He divides the whole\nhistory of philosophy in three periods (ancient, medieval, and modern\nphilosophy), each of which can, according to him, be subdivided in\nfour phases. The first is a creative phase of renewal and ascending\ndevelopment; the other three are phases of decline, dominated by a\nturn towards practical interests, by scepticism, and finally by\nmysticism. After the fourth phase, a new period begins with a creative\nphase of renewal.  \nBrentano has presented his model to a larger audience quite late in\nhis life, but he had come up with it very early in his career; Carl\nStumpf reports that Brentano first came up with this idea in 1860 and\nthat he used it in his lectures on the history of philosophy already\nin Würzburg in the mid-sixties (cf. Stumpf 1919, 89f). While both\nthe historical accuracy of and the principles of cultural psychology\nthat gave rise to the model can be put in question (cf. Gilson 1976),\nit definitely tells the reader much about Brentano’s conception\nof philosophy and his vivid interest in its history. Brentano’s\nshort text can, thus, best be read as a simplifying narrative that\nallows the author to explain his conviction that philosophy ought to\npursue of pure, theoretical interests and to express his fascination\nfor philosophers like Aristotle, Thomas, or Descartes as well as his\ndislike of Plotinus, Nicolas of Cues, Kant, Hegel, and Schelling.  \nEven though Brentano worked on problems in metaphysics and ontology\nthroughout his life, he hardly published on these topics during his\nlifetime. The impact of his views is due to the fact that from his\nearly lectures at the University of Würzburg on he discussed them\nwith his students, both in class and (especially in later years) in\ncorrespondence.  \nEven though Brentano’s views have underwent considerable changes\nover the years, his general attitude can be characterized as sober,\nparsimonious, and (in the current use of the term) nominalistic; at no\npoint did he admit the existence of universals, he rather relied on\nmereological principles to account for classical problems in ontology.\n \nBrentano’s early metaphysics, which is the result of his\ncritical reading of Aristotle, is a form of conceptualism. He does\ndistinguish between substance and accidents, but argues that both are\nbut fictions cum fundamentum in re. With this, he wants to\nsuggest that they do not have actual existence, but that we can make\njudgments about real things that are correct and contain references to\nsubstances and accidents. This view is closely connected to his\nepistemic notion of truth, according to which the question of whether\na judgment is true does not depend on its corresponding to reality,\nbut rather on whether it can be judged with evidence. Brentano\nelucidates the relation between a thing and its properties on the\nbasis of the mereological notions of “logical part” and\n“metaphysical part,” the former of which account for\nabstract, repeatable properties, the latter for the concrete\nproperties of a thing. Both are not considered to be denizens of\nreality in a narrow sense, but rather fictions that have a foundation\nin reality. (For a reconstruction and discussion of the details of\nBrentano’s early ontology, cf. Chrudzimski 2004). \nAfter the introduction of the notion of intentionality in his\nPsychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874), Brentano\nstruggled to account for the ontological status of the intentional\nobject. When he first introduces the notion, suggesting, as we have\nseen above, that “[e]very mental phenomenon includes something\nas object within itself” (PES, 88), he seems to be\ninterested primarily in presenting a psychological thesis and does not\nseem to be overly worried with its ontological implications; at this\npoint, the talk of an “immanent object” might have been a\nmere façon de parler(cf. Chrudzimski and Smith, 2003,\n205). Soon Brentano finds himself in the need, however, to address\nthis question and, as a result, to enrich the domain of objects in his\nontology. He seems to admit that next to concrete things there are\nirrealia, that is, objects that to not really exist but have\nthe status of thought-objects or, as he puts it, entia\nrationis, that do not have an essence and do not stand in causal\nrelations. Brentano does not systematically elaborate his ontological\nposition in this period, we rather find a bundle of ideas of which he\ndid not seem to be fully convinced. This underlines that the\nformulation of these views was not made with the intention to make a\ncontribution to ontology, but rather to reply to concerns that have\nemerged from his introduction of the notion of intentionality.  \nIn his late philosophy, from 1904 on, Brentano rediscovers the virtue\nof ontological parsimony and takes up the main insights of his\nconceptualist period, developing (and radicalizing) them to a form of\n reism,\n according to which the only items that exist are individual things\n(res). “While young Brentano tried to ontologically\nplay down certain ways of speaking, late Brentano tried to eliminate\nthem from philosophical discourse” (Chrudzimski 2004, 177) [my\ntranslation. “Der junge Brentano versuchte gewisse\nRedeweisen ontologisch zu bagatellisieren, der späte\nBrentano versuchte sie aus dem philosophischen Diskurs zu\neliminieren”] . He abandons the notion of\nirrealia, which he now regards as linguistic fictions, and\ncontinues to deny the existence of universals or abstract entities.\nInstead, he conceives both substances and accidents as real things\nthat are related to one another by a particular mereological relation:\nan accident does not only ontologically depend on the substance, it\nalso contains the substance as a part without, however, containing any\nsupplementary part. A white table, accordingly, is an accident that\ncontains the table as a part. If we were to paint it red, the white\ntable would cease to exist and the red table would come into existence\n– the continuity between the two being guaranteed by the table,\nwhich was part of the white table and is now part of the red table.\n \nBrentano’s ontology is known to a broader audience only through\nposthumously published works that were edited by his late students\nOskar Kraus and Alfred Kastil, who considered his late position most\nimportant and accordingly put less emphasis on Brentano’s\nearlier phases. Only recently the development of Brentano’s\nviews on ontology has gained more attention, mainly through the work\nof scholars who were able to study unpublished manuscripts in the\narchives (cf., for example, Chrudzimski 2004). This underlines once\nmore the need of a critical edition of Brentano’s entire\nNachlass, which would make it possible for a broader audience\nto critically assess the development of Brentano’s views in\nontology.  \nBrentano’s contributions to philosophy were widely discussed\namong philosophers and psychologists at the end of the nineteenth and\nthe beginning of the twentieth century. Moreover, he had a strong\nimpact on an impressive number of students who became famous\nphilosophers on their own right. Often, these philosophers are\nreferred to as the “School of Franz Brentano,” (cf.\nAlbertazzi e.al. 1996) in order to underline that all of them drew\nexplicitly (and when not explicitly, then recognizably) on\nBrentano’s work. All members of the school have become\nacquainted with Brentano’s philosophy in his lectures or through\nconversation or correspondence with him, but they form a quite\nheterogeneous group that did not make attempts to jointly develop a\nshared position: there was no general acceptance of a specific\nunifying doctrine of the “School”, nor did its members\nmake attempts to unite forces and cooperate on specific projects. What\nunites the School is a vivid interests in the topics that Brentano\ndiscussed in his lectures, first and foremost in psychology and in the\nidea that philosophy should adopt a rigorous, scientific method (cf.\nDewalque 2017a, b). In fact, it was Brentano’s methodological\nmaxim that has raised the interest in most members of the school in\nthe first place, cf., for example, Stumpf (1919) and Husserl (1919),\nboth of who suggest that Brentano’s conception of philosophy as\na rigorous science had a decisive impact on their decision to pursue a\nprofessional career in philosophy. \nBrentano’s influence on students has seen different phases that\nare loosely connected to the places where he taught. In his early\nyears in Würzburg (1866–1873), Brentano became noted mainly\nfor his attempt to renew philosophy on the basis of a rigorous,\nscientific method. His most important students at the time,\n Carl Stumpf\n and\n Anton Marty,\n made a significant academic career in their own right. As Brentano\nwas not yet appointed professor and could, in consequence, not yet\nsupervise PhD theses, both completed their PhD with Lotze in\nGöttingen. Stumpf then held positions in Prague, Halle, Munich,\nand Berlin, where he founded a psychological laboratory and gave\ndecisive impulses for the development of Gestalt psychology. Anton\nMarty became professor at the University of Prague and had a strong\ninfluence with his work on the philosophy of language. Both Stumpf and\nMarty developed their own positions and deviated locally from\nBrentano’s views, but they remained faithful followers who\ncontinued to acknowledge the influence that Brentano has had on\nthem. \nWhen Brentano took up teaching at the University of Vienna in 1874,\nhis lectures soon became very popular among students. In the first\nyears, Thomas Masaryk (who later became the first president of the\nCzechoslovakia),\n Alexius Meinong,\n Alois Höfler, and\n Christian von Ehrenfels\n attended Brentano’s lectures. In the years after 1880 (when\nBrentano had lost his chair and was teaching as Privatdozent,\nwhich meant that he could no longer supervise PhD theses) Franz\nHillebrand,\n Edmund Husserl,\n and\n Kazimierz Twardowski\n studied with him. Unlike Stumpf or Marty, Brentano’s students\nin Vienna encountered a mature professor who had his opus\nmaximum already published. Their relation to Brentano, in\nconsequence, was less that of a friendship, and more that between a\nstudent and a renowned professor. Soon many of them have felt the urge\nto overcome Brentano’s influence and define their own,\nindependent philosophical position – and possibly form a school\nin their own right. In particular Meinong and Husserl, who are\nprobably the most famous representants of Brentano’s school,\ncame to have a rather troublesome relation to their former teacher. It\nis not by accident that both used the term “Brentano\nSchool” only to distance themselves from it. \nIn 1895, when Brentano gave up his position as Privatdozent\nin Vienna and moved to Florence, he gave up teaching and could no\nlonger exert a direct influence on students. In this period, the\ncenter of the Brentano school moved to Prague, where Anton Marty held\nregular meetings with interested students, among them Oskar Kraus and\nAlfred Kastil. These second-generation members of the Brentano school\n– who are often called “Brentanoten” or\n“orthodox Brentanists” – stayed very faithful to\nBrentano’s philosophy, (in particular to his last, reistic phase\nthat they knew first-hand). They saw it as their main task to preserve\nBrentano’s view and to defend them against the developments\nintroduced by Husserl and the early phenomenologists as well as those\nintroduced by Meinong and other members of the Graz School,\nrespectively. After Brentano’s death in 1917, they tried to set\nup and archive for Brentano’s Nachlass and publish\ntexts from it posthumously. While in the first years they achieved\nconsiderable results, not at least due to the help of the Czech\npresident Jan Masaryk, the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938\nforced them into emigration and so brought an end to the Brentano\nSchool. \nBrentano’s impact in a larger philosophical audience was soon\neclipsed by that of his students who founded philosophical traditions\non their own: Husserl started the\n phenomenological movement,\n Meinong the Graz school, Twardowski the\n Lvov-Warsaw School.\n As a result, in the second half of the twentieth century Brentano was\noften mentioned as the philosopher who had (re-)introduced\nthe notion of intentionality, as “grandfather” of the\nphenomenological movement, or for his influence on early analytic\nphilosophy, but his own philosophical views and arguments were hardly\ndiscussed.  \nThere are notable exceptions to this tendency, though. Roderick\nChisholm, for example, made a continuous effort to show\nBrentano’s significance to contemporary philosophy by adopting\nhis results in his own contributions to the philosophy of mind, but\nalso in presentations of various aspects of Brentano’s thought\n(cf. Chisholm 1966, 1982, and 1986). Moreover, in recent decades the\ntradition that is often referred to as “Austrian\nphilosophy” has gained increasing interest in a broader\nphilosophical audience, which is due mainly to the work of Rudolf\nHaller, Barry Smith, Peter Simons, and Kevin Mulligan, among others.\nBy showing the systematic relevance of Brentano’s (and other\nAustrian philosophers’) contributions to problems discussed in\nontology, logic, the theory of emotions, or consciousness, they could\ncounteract the tendency to reduce Brentano’s contributions to\nthe introduction of the notion of intentionality.  \nIt is quite interesting to note, however, that in the last two decades\nthe philosophical contributions of Brentano have gained a new life as\nan increasing number of philosophers from different fields are\nrediscovering and elaborating on different themes from\nBrentano’s work. His contributions to the philosophy of mind\nhave been taken up and play a central role in the debate concerning\nthe nature of consciousness and the relation between\n consciousness and intentionality,\n the\n unity of consciousness\n and\n time-consciousness;\n his views on ethics have been inspired\n fitting attitude theories of value,\n which analyze ethical value in terms of correct or incorrect forms of\napproval or disapproval. Moreover, the recent centenary of\nBrentano’s death (2017) has given occasion to a number of\nconferences and publications that put Brentano’s contribution at\nthe center of attention (cf., for example, Kriegel 2017). This shows\nthat the interest in Brentano’s systematic contribution to\nphilosophy is still strong and vivid. ","contact.mail":"wolfgang.huemer@unipr.it","contact.domain":"unipr.it"}]
