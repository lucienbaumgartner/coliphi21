As such, friendship is undoubtedly\ncentral to our lives, in part because the special concern we have for\nour friends must have a place within a broader set of concerns,\nincluding moral concerns, and in part because our friends can help\nshape who we are as persons. Given this centrality, important\nquestions arise concerning the justification of friendship and, in\nthis context, whether it is permissible to “trade up” when\nsomeone new comes along, as well as concerning the possibility of\nreconciling the demands of friendship with the demands of morality in\ncases in which the two seem to conflict.\n\nFriendship essentially involves a distinctive kind of concern for your\nfriend, a concern which might reasonably be understood as a kind of\nlove. Philosophers from the ancient Greeks on have traditionally\ndistinguished three notions that can properly be called love:\nagape, eros, and philia.\n Agape\n is a kind of love that does not respond to the antecedent value of\nits object but instead is thought to create value in the\nbeloved; it has come through the Christian tradition to mean the sort\nof love God has for us persons as well as, by extension, our love for\nGod and our love for humankind in general. By contrast,\n eros\n and philia are generally understood to be responsive to the\nmerits of their objects—to the beloved’s properties,\nespecially his goodness or beauty. The difference is that\neros is a kind of passionate desire for an object, typically\nsexual in nature, whereas\n ‘philia’\n originally meant a kind of affectionate regard or friendly feeling\ntowards not just one’s friends but also possibly towards family\nmembers, business partners, and one’s country at large (Liddell\net al., 1940; Cooper, 1977a). Given this classification of kinds of\nlove, philia seems to be that which is most clearly relevant\nto friendship (though just what philia amounts to needs to be\nclarified in more detail). \nFor this reason, love and friendship often get lumped together as a\nsingle topic; nonetheless, there are significant differences between\nthem. As understood here, love is an evaluative attitude\ndirected at particular persons as such, an attitude which we might\ntake towards someone whether or not that love is reciprocated and\nwhether or not we have an established relationship with\n her.[1]\n Friendship, by contrast, is essentially a kind of\nrelationship grounded in a particular kind of special concern\neach has for the other as the person she is; and whereas we must make\nconceptual room for the idea of unrequited love, unrequited friendship\nis senseless. Consequently, accounts of friendship tend to understand\nit not merely as a case of reciprocal love of some form (together with\nmutual acknowledgment of this love), but as essentially involving\nsignificant interactions between the friends—as being in this\nsense a certain kind of relationship. \nNonetheless, questions can be raised about precisely how to\ndistinguish romantic relationships, grounded in eros, from\nrelationships of friendship, grounded in philia, insofar as\neach involves significant interactions between the involved parties\nthat stem from a kind of reciprocal love that is responsive to merit.\nClearly the two differ insofar as romantic love normally has a kind of\nsexual involvement that friendship lacks; yet, as Thomas (1989) asks,\nis that enough to explain the real differences between them? Badhwar\n(2003, 65–66) seems to think so, claiming that the sexual\ninvolvement enters into romantic love in part through a passion and\nyearning for physical union, whereas friendship involves instead a\ndesire for a more psychological identification. Yet it is not clear\nexactly how to understand this: precisely what kind of\n“psychological identification” or intimacy is\ncharacteristic of friendship? (For further discussion, see\n Section 1.2.) \nIn philosophical discussions of friendship, it is common to follow\nAristotle (Nicomachean Ethics, Book VIII) in distinguishing\nthree kinds of friendship: friendships of pleasure, of utility, and of\nvirtue. Although it is a bit unclear how to understand these\ndistinctions, the basic idea seems to be that pleasure, utility, and\nvirtue are the reasons we have in these various kinds of relationships\nfor loving our friend. That is, I may love my friend because of the\npleasure I get out of her, or because of the ways in which she is\nuseful to me, or because I find her to have a virtuous character.\nGiven the involvement of love in each case, all three kinds of\nfriendship seem to involve a concern for your friend for his sake and\nnot for your own. \nThere is an apparent tension here between the idea that friendship\nessentially involves being concerned for your friend for his sake and\nthe idea of pleasure and utility friendships: how can you be concerned\nfor him for his sake if you do that only because of the pleasure or\nutility you get out of it? If you benefit your friend because,\nultimately, of the benefits you receive, it would seem that you do not\nproperly love your friend for his sake, and so your relationship is\nnot fully one of friendship after all. So it looks like pleasure and\nutility friendships are at best deficient modes of friendship; by\ncontrast, virtue friendships, because they are motivated by the\nexcellences of your friend’s character, are genuine,\nnon-deficient friendships. For this reason, most contemporary\naccounts, by focusing their attention on the non-deficient forms of\nfriendship, ignore pleasure and utility\n friendships.[2] \nAs mentioned in the first paragraph of this section, philia\nseems to be the kind of concern for other persons that is most\nrelevant to friendship, and the word, ‘philia,’\nsometimes gets translated as friendship; yet philia is in\nsome ways importantly different from what we ordinarily think of as\nfriendship.\n Thus,\n ‘philia’ extends not just to friends but also to\nfamily members, business associates, and one’s country at large.\nContemporary accounts of friendship differ on whether family members,\nin particular one’s children before they become adults, can be\nfriends. Most philosophers think not, understanding friendship to be\nessentially a relationship among equals; yet some philosophers (such\nas Friedman 1989; Rorty 1986/1993; Badhwar 1987) explicitly intend\ntheir accounts of friendship to include parent-child relationships,\nperhaps through the influence of the historical notion of\nphilia. Nonetheless, there do seem to be significant\ndifferences between, on the one hand, parental love and the\nrelationships it generates and, on the other hand, the love of\none’s friends and the relationships it generates; the focus here\nwill be on friendship more narrowly construed. \nIn philosophical accounts of friendship, several themes recur\nconsistently, although various accounts differ in precisely how they\nspell these out. These themes are: mutual caring (or love), intimacy,\nand shared activity; these will be considered in turn. \nA necessary condition of friendship, according to just about every\nview (Telfer 1970–71; Annas 1988, 1977; Annis 1987; Badhwar\n1987; Millgram 1987; Sherman 1987; Thomas 1987, 1989, 1993; Friedman\n1993, 1989; Whiting 1991; Hoffman 1997; Cocking & Kennett 1998;\nand White 1999a, 1999b, 2001) is that the friends each care about the\nother, and do so for her sake; in effect, this is to say that the\nfriends must each love the other. Although many accounts of friendship\ndo not analyze such mutual caring any further, among those that do\nthere is considerable variability as to how we should understand the\nkind of caring involved in friendship. Nonetheless, there is\nwidespread agreement that caring about someone for his sake involves\nboth sympathy and action on the friend’s behalf. That is,\nfriends must be moved by what happens to their friends to feel the\nappropriate emotions: joy in their friends’ successes,\nfrustration and disappointment in their friends’ failures (as\nopposed to disappointment in the friends themselves), etc. Moreover,\nin part as an expression of their caring for each other, friends must\nnormally be disposed to promote the other’s good for her sake\nand not out of any ulterior motive. (However, see Velleman 1999 for a\ndissenting view.) \nTo care about something is generally to find it worthwhile or valuable\nin some way; caring about one’s friend is no exception. A\ncentral difference among the various accounts of mutual caring is the\nway in which these accounts understand the kind of evaluation implicit\ntherein. Most accounts understand that evaluation to be a matter of\nappraisal: we care about our friends at least in part because of the\ngood qualities of their characters that we discover them to have\n(Annas 1977; Sherman 1987; Whiting 1991); this is in line with the\nunderstanding of love as philia or eros given in the\nfirst paragraph of Section 1 above. Other accounts, however,\nunderstand caring as in part a matter of bestowing value on your\nbeloved: in caring about a friend, we thereby project a kind of\nintrinsic value onto him; this is in line with the understanding of\nlove as agape given above.  \nFriedman (1989, 6) argues for bestowal, saying that if we were to base\nour friendship on positive appraisals of our friend’s\nexcellences, “to that extent our commitment to that\nperson is subordinate to our commitment to the relevant [evaluative]\nstandards and is not intrinsically a commitment to that person.”\nHowever, this is too quick, for to appeal to an appraisal of the good\nqualities of your friend’s character in order to justify your\nfriendship is not on its own to subordinate your friendship to that\nappraisal. Rather, through the friendship, and through changes in your\nfriend over time, you may come to change your evaluative outlook,\nthereby in effect subordinating your commitment to certain values to\nyour commitment to your friend. Of course, within friendship the\ninfluence need not go only one direction: friends influence each\nother’s conceptions of value and how to live. Indeed, that\nfriends have a reciprocal effect on each other is a part of the\nconcern for equality many find essential to friendship, and it is\ncentral to the discussion of intimacy in\n Section 1.2. \n(For more on the notion of caring about another for her sake and the\nvariety of philosophical accounts of it, see the entry on\n love.) \nThe relationship of friendship differs from other interpersonal\nrelationships, even those characterized by mutual caring, such as\nrelationships among colleagues: friendships are, intuitively,\n“deeper,” more intimate relationships. The\nquestion facing any philosophical account is how that characteristic\nintimacy of friendship is to be understood. \nOn this point, there is considerable variation in the\nliterature—so much that it raises the question whether differing\naccounts aim at elucidating the same object. For it seems as though\nwhen the analysis of intimacy is relatively weak, the aim is to\nelucidate what might be called “acquaintance friendships”;\nas the analysis of intimacy gets stronger, the aim seems to tend\ntowards closer friendships and even to a kind of ideal of maximally\nclose friendship. It might be asked whether one or another of these\ntypes of friendship ought to take priority in the analysis, such that,\nfor example, cases of close friendship can be understood to be an\nenhanced version of acquaintance friendship, or whether acquaintance\nfriendship should be understood as being deficient in various ways\nrelative to ideal friendship. Nonetheless, in what follows, views will\nbe presented roughly in order from weaker to stronger accounts of\nintimacy. \nTo begin, Thomas (1987; 1989; 1993; 2013) claims that we should\nunderstand what is here called the intimacy of friendship in terms of\nmutual self-disclosure: I tell my friends things about myself that I\nwould not dream of telling others, and I expect them to make me privy\nto intimate details of their lives. The point of such mutual\nself-disclosure, Thomas argues, is to create the “bond of\ntrust” essential to friendship, for through such self-disclosure\nwe simultaneously make ourselves vulnerable to each other and\nacknowledge the goodwill the other has for us. Such a bond of trust is\nwhat institutes the kind of intimacy characteristic of friendship.\n(Similar ideas can be found in Annis 1987.) \nCocking & Kennett (1998) caricature this as “the secrets\nview,” arguing: \nTheir point is that the secrets view underestimates the kind of trust\nat issue in friendship, conceiving of it largely as a matter of\ndiscretion. Given the way friendship essentially involves each caring\nabout the other’s good for the other’s sake and so acting\non behalf of the other’s good, entering into and sustaining a\nrelationship of friendship will normally involve considerable\ntrust in your friend’s goodwill towards you generally, and not\njust concerning your secrets. Moreover, friendship will normally\ninvolve trust in your friend’s judgment concerning what is in\nyour best interests, for when your friend sees you harming yourself,\nshe ought, other things being equal, to intervene, and through the\nfriendship you can come to rely on her to do so. (See also Alfano,\n2016, who emphasizes not just trust but trustworthiness to make\nsimilar points.) \nSuch enhanced trust can lead to “shared interests or enthusiasms\nor views … [or] a similar style of mind or way of thinking\nwhich makes for a high degree of empathy” (Telfer 1970–71,\n227). Telfer finds such shared interests central to the “sense\nof a bond” friends have, an idea similar to the\n“solidarity”—the sharing of values and a sense of\nwhat’s important—that White (2001) advocates as central to\nfriendship. For trusting my friend’s assessments of my good in\nthis way seemingly involves trusting not only that she understands who\nI am and that I find certain things valuable and important in\nlife but also and centrally that she understands the value of\nthese things that are so meaningful to me. That in turn seems to be\ngrounded in the empathy we have for each other—the shared sense\nof what’s important. So Telfer and White, in appealing to such\nshared sense of value, are offering a somewhat richer sense of the\nsort of intimacy essential to friendship than Thomas and Annis. \nAn important question to ask, however, is what precisely is meant by\nthe “sharing” of a sense of value. Once again there are\nweaker and stronger versions. On the weak side, a sense of value is\nshared in the sense that a coincidence of interests and values is a\nnecessary condition of developing and sustaining a friendship; when\nthat happy coincidence dissipates, so too does the friendship. It is\npossible to read Annas’s summary of Aristotle’s view of\nfriendship this way (1988, 1): \n(4) and (5) are the important claims for present purposes: making the\nsame choices as your friend, if done consistently, depends on having a\nsimilar outlook on what reasons there are so to choose, and this point\nis reinforced in (5) given Aristotle’s understanding of pleasure\nand pain as evaluative and so as revealing what is (apparently) good\nand bad. The message might be that merely having coincidence in\nevaluative outlook is enough to satisfy (4) and (5). \nOf course, Aristotle (and Annas) would reject this reading: friends do\nnot merely have such similarities antecedent to their friendship as a\nnecessary condition of friendship. Rather, friends can influence and\nshape each other’s evaluative outlook, so that the sharing of a\nsense of value is reinforced through the dynamics of their\nrelationship. One way to make sense of this is through the\nAristotelian idea that friends function as a kind of mirror of each\nother: insofar as friendship rests on similarity of character, and\ninsofar as I can have only imperfect direct knowledge about my own\ncharacter, I can best come to know myself—both the strengths and\nweaknesses of my character—by knowing a friend who reflects my\nqualities of character. Minor differences between friends, as when my\nfriend on occasion makes a choice I would not have made, can lead me\nto reflect on whether this difference reveals a flaw in my own\ncharacter that might need to be fixed, thereby reinforcing the\nsimilarity of my and my friend’s evaluative outlooks. On this\nreading of the mirroring view, my friend plays an entirely passive\nrole: just by being himself, he enables me to come to understand my\nown character better (cf.\n Badhwar 2003).[3] \nCocking & Kennett (1998) argue against such a mirroring view in\ntwo ways. First, they claim that this view places too much emphasis on\nsimilarity as motivating and sustaining the friendship. Friends can be\nvery different from each other, and although within a friendship there\nis a tendency for the friends to become more and more alike, this\nshould be understood as an effect of friendship, not\nsomething constitutive of it. Second, they argue that the appeal to\nthe friend’s role as a mirror to explain the increasing\nsimilarity involves assigning too much passivity to the friend. Our\nfriends, they argue, play a more active role in shaping us, and the\nmirroring view fails to acknowledge this. (Cocking &\nKennett’s views will be discussed further below. Lynch (2005)\nprovides further criticisms of the mirroring view, arguing that the\ndifferences between friends can be central and important to their\nfriendship.) \nIn an interesting twist on standard accounts of the sense in which\n(according to Aristotle, at least) a friend is a mirror, Millgram\n(1987) claims that in mirroring my friend I am causally responsible\nfor my friend coming to have and sustain the virtues he has.\nConsequently, I am in a sense my friend’s\n“procreator,” and I therefore find myself actualized in my\nfriend. For this reason, Millgram claims, I come to love my friend in\nthe same way I love myself, and this explains (a) Aristotle’s\notherwise puzzling claim that a friend is “another self,”\n(b) why it is that friends are not fungible, given my role as\nprocreator only of this particular person, and (c) why friendships of\npleasure and utility, which do not involve such procreation, fail to\nbe genuine friendships. (For more on the problem of fungibility, see\n Section 2.1.)\n However, in offering this account, Millgram may seem to confound my\nbeing causally necessary for my friend’s virtues with\nmy being responsible for those virtues—to confound my\npassive role as a mirror with that of a “procreator,” a\nseemingly active role. Millgram’s understanding of mirroring\ndoes not, therefore, escape Cocking & Kennett’s criticism of\nmirroring views as assigning too much passivity to the friend as\nmirror. \nFriedman (1989) offers another way to make sense of the influence my\nfriend has on my sense of value by appealing to the notion of\nbestowal. According to Friedman, the intimacy of friendship takes the\nform of a commitment friends have to each other as unique persons, a\ncommitment in which the \nAs noted in the 3rd paragraph of\n Section 1.1,\n Friedman thinks my commitment to my friend cannot be grounded in\nappraisals of her, and so my acknowledgment of the worth of her goals,\netc., is a matter of my bestowing value on these: her ends become\nvaluable to me, and so suitable for motivating my actions, “just\nbecause they are hers.” That is, such a commitment involves\ntaking my friend seriously, where this means something like finding\nher values, interests, reasons, etc. provide me with pro\ntanto reasons for me to value and think\n similarly.[4]\n In this way, the dynamics of the friendship relation involves friends\nmutually influencing each other’s sense of value, which thereby\ncomes to be shared in a way that underwrites significant intimacy. \nIn part, Friedman’s point is that sharing an evaluative\nperspective in the way that constitutes the intimacy of friendship\ninvolves coming to adopt her values as parts of my own sense of value.\nWhiting (1991) argues that such an approach fails properly to make\nsense of the idea that I love my friend for her sake. For to\nrequire that my friend’s values be my own is to blur the\ndistinction between valuing these things for her sake and valuing them\nfor my own. Moreover, Whiting (1986) argues, to understand my concern\nfor her for her sake in terms of my concern for things for my sake\nraises the question of how to understand this latter concern. However,\nWhiting thinks the latter is at least as unclear as the former, as is\nrevealed when we think about the long-term and my connection and\nresponsibility to my “future selves.” The solution, she\nclaims, is to understand the value of my ends (or yours) to be\nindependent of the fact that they are mine (or yours): these ends are\nintrinsically valuable, and that’s why I should care about them,\nno matter whose ends they are. Consequently, the reason I have to care\nfor myself, including my future selves, for my sake is the\nsame as the reason I have to care about my friend for her\nsake: because I recognize the intrinsic value of the (excellent)\ncharacter she or I have (Whiting 1991, 10; for a similar view,\nsee Keller 2000). Whiting therefore advocates what she calls an\n“impersonal” conception of friendship: There are\npotentially many people exhibiting (what I would consider to be)\nexcellences of character, and these are my impersonal friends\ninsofar as they are all “equally worthy of my concern”;\nwhat explains but does not justify my “differential and\napparently personal concern for only some … [is]\nlargely a function of historical and psychological accident”\n(1991, 23). \nIt should be clear that Whiting does not merely claim that friends\nshare values only in that these values happen to coincide; if that\nwere the case, her conception of friendship would be vulnerable to the\ncharge that the friends really are not concerned for each other but\nmerely for the intrinsically valuable properties that each\nexemplifies. Rather, Whiting thinks that part of what makes my concern\nfor my friend be for her sake is my being committed to remind her of\nwhat’s really valuable in life and to foster within her a\ncommitment to these values so as to prevent her from going astray.\nSuch a commitment on my part is clearly a commitment to her, and a\nrelationship characterized by such a commitment on both sides is one\nthat consistently and non-accidentally reinforces the sharing of these\nvalues. \nBrink (1999) criticizes Whiting’s account of friendship as too\nimpersonal because it fails to understand the relationship of\nfriendship itself to be intrinsically valuable. (For similar\ncriticisms, see Jeske 1997.) In part, the complaint is the same as\nthat which Friedman (1989) offered against any conception of\nfriendship that bases that friendship on appraisals of the\nfriend’s properties (cf. the 3rd paragraph of\n Section 1.1\n above): such a conception of friendship subordinates our concern for\nthe friend to our concern for the values, thereby neglecting what\nmakes friendship a distinctively personal relationship. Given\nWhiting’s understanding of the sense in which friends share\nvalues in terms of their appeal to the intrinsic and impersonal worth\nof those values, it seems that she cannot make much of the rebuttal to\nFriedman offered above: that I can subordinate my concern for certain\nvalues to my concern for my friend, thereby changing my values in part\nout of concern for my friend. Nonetheless, Brink’s criticism\ngoes deeper: \nIt is only in terms of the significance of the historical\nrelationship, Brink argues, that we can make sense of the reasons for\nfriendship and for the concern and activity friendship demands as\nbeing agent-relative (and so in this way personal) rather than\nagent-neutral (or impersonal, as for\n Whiting).[5] \nCocking & Kennett (1998), in what might be a development of Rorty\n(1986/1993), offer an account of close friendship in part in terms of\nthe friends playing a more active role in transforming each\nother’s evaluative outlook: in friendship, they claim, we are\n“receptive” to having our friends “direct” and\n“interpret” us and thereby change our interests. To be\ndirected by your friend is to allow her interests, values,\netc. to shape your own; thus, your friend may suggest that you go to\nthe opera together, and you may agree to go, even though you have no\nantecedent interest in the opera. Through his interest, enthusiasm,\nand suggestion (“Didn’t you just love the concluding duet\nof Act III?”), you may be moved directly by him to acquire an\ninterest in opera only because he’s your friend. To be\ninterpreted by your friend is to allow your understanding of\nyourself, in particular of your strengths and weaknesses, to be shaped\nby your friend’s interpretations of you. Thus, your friend may\nadmire your tenacity (a trait you did not realize you had), or be\namused by your excessive concern for fairness, and you may come as a\nresult to develop a new understanding of yourself, and potentially\nchange yourself, in direct response to his interpretation of you.\nHence, Cocking & Kennett claim, “the self my friend sees is,\nat least in part, a product of the friendship” (505). (Nehamas\n2010 offers a similar account of the importance of the interpretation\nof one’s friends in determining who one is, though Nehamas\nemphasizes in a way that Cocking & Kennett do not that your\ninterpretation of your friend can reveal possible valuable ways to be\nthat you yourself “could never have even imagined\nbeforehand” (287).) \nIt is a bit unclear what your role is in being thus directed and\ninterpreted by your friend. Is it a matter of merely passively\naccepting the direction and interpretation? This is suggested by\nCocking & Kennett’s understanding of friendship in terms of\na receptivity to being drawn by your friend and by their\napparent understanding of this receptivity in dispositional terms. Yet\nthis would seem to be a matter of ceding your autonomy to your friend,\nand that is surely not what they intend. Rather, it seems, we are at\nleast selective in the ways in which we allow our friends to direct\nand interpret us, and we can resist other directions and\ninterpretations. However, this raises the question of why we allow any\nsuch direction and interpretation. One answer would be because we\nrecognize the independent value of the interests of our friends, or\nthat we recognize the truth of their interpretations of us. But this\nwould not explain the role of friendship in such direction and\ninterpretation, for we might just as easily accept such direction and\ninterpretation from a mentor or possibly even a stranger. This\nshortcoming might push us to understanding our receptivity to\ndirection and interpretation not in dispositional terms but rather in\nnormative terms: other things being equal, we ought to accept\ndirection and interpretation from our friends precisely because they\nare our friends. And this might push us to a still stronger conception\nof intimacy, of the sharing of values, in terms of which we can\nunderstand why friendship grounds these norms. \nSuch a stronger conception of intimacy is provided in Sherman’s\ninterpretation of Aristotle’s account (Sherman 1987). According\nto Sherman’s Aristotle, an important component of friendship is\nthat friends identify with each other in the sense that they exhibit a\n“singleness of mind.” This includes, first, a kind of\nsympathy, whereby I feel on my friend’s behalf the same emotions\nhe does. Unlike similar accounts, Sherman explicitly includes pride\nand shame as emotions I sympathetically feel on behalf of my\nfriend—a significant addition because of the role pride and\nshame have in constituting our sense of ourselves and even our\nidentities (Taylor 1985). In part for this reason, Sherman claims that\n“through the sense of belonging and attachment” we attain\nbecause of such sympathetic pride and shame, “we identify with\nand share their [our friends’] good”\n (600).[6] \nSecond, and more important, Sherman’s Aristotle understands the\nsingleness of mind that friends have in terms of shared processes of\ndeliberation. Thus, as she summarizes a passage in Aristotle\n(1170b11–12): \nThe point is that the friends “share” a conception of\nvalues not merely in that there is significant overlap between the\nvalues of the one friend and those of the other, and not merely in\nthat this overlap is maintained through the influence that the friends\nhave on each other. Rather, the values are shared in the sense that\nthey are most fundamentally their values, at which they\njointly arrive by deliberating together. \nThe intent of this account, in which what gets shared is, we might\nsay, an identity that the friends have in common, is not to be\ndescriptively accurate of particular friendships; it is rather to\nprovide a kind of ideal that actual friendships at best only\napproximate. Such a strong notion of sharing is reminiscent of the\nunion view of (primarily erotic) love, according to which love\nconsists in the formation of some significant kind of union, a\n“we” (see the entry on\n love,\n the section on\n love as union).\n Like the union view of love, this account of friendship raises\nworries about autonomy. Thus, it seems as though Sherman’s\nAristotle does away with any clear distinction between the interests\nand even agency of the two friends, thereby undermining the kind of\nindependence and freedom of self-development that characterizes\nautonomy. If autonomy is a part of the individual’s good, then\nSherman’s Aristotle might be forced to conclude that friendship\nis to this extent bad; the conclusion might be, therefore, that we\nought to reject this strong conception of the intimacy of\nfriendship. \nIt is unclear from Sherman’s interpretation of Aristotle whether\nthere are principled reasons to limit the extent to which we share our\nidentities with our friends; perhaps an appeal to something like\nFriedman’s federation model (1998) can help resolve these\ndifficulties. Friedman’s idea is that we should understand\nromantic love (but the idea could also be applied to friendship) not\nin terms of the union of the two individuals, in which their\nidentities get subsumed by that union, but rather in terms of the\nfederation of the individuals—the creation of a third entity\nthat presupposes some degree of independence of the individuals that\nmake it up. Even so, much would need to be done to spell out this view\nsatisfactorily. (For more on Friedman’s account, see the entry\non\n love,\n the section on\n love as union.) \nIn each of these accounts of the kind of intimacy and commitment that\nare characteristic of friendship, we might ask about the conditions\nunder which friendship can properly be dissolved. Thus, insofar as\nfriendship involves some such commitment, we cannot just give up on\nour friends for no reason at all; nor, it seems, should our commitment\nbe unconditional, binding on us come what may. Understanding more\nclearly when it is proper to break off a friendship, or allow it to\nlapse, may well shed light on the kind of commitment and intimacy that\nis characteristic of friendship; nonetheless, this issue gets scant\nattention in the literature. \nA final common thread in philosophical accounts of friendship is\nshared activity. The background intuition is this: never to share\nactivity with someone and in this way to interact with him is not to\nhave the kind of relationship with him that could be called\nfriendship, even if you each care for the other for his sake. Rather,\nfriends engage in joint pursuits, in part motivated by the\nfriendship itself. These joint pursuits can include not only such\nthings as making something together, playing together, and talking\ntogether, but also pursuits that essentially involve shared\nexperiences, such as going to the opera together. Yet for these\npursuits to be properly shared in the relevant sense of\n“share,” they cannot involve activities motivated simply\nby self interest: by, for example, the thought that I’ll help\nyou build your fence today if you later help me paint my house.\nRather, the activity must be pursued in part for the purpose of doing\nit together with my friend, and this is the point of saying that the\nshared activity must be motivated, at least in part, by the friendship\nitself. \nThis raises the following questions: in what sense can such activity\nbe said to be “shared,” and what is it about friendship\nthat makes shared activity so central to it? The common answer to this\nsecond question (which helps pin down an answer to the first) is that\nshared activity is important because friends normally have shared\ninterests as a part of the intimacy that is characteristic of\nfriendship as such, and the “shared” pursuit of such\nshared interests is therefore an important part of friendship.\nConsequently, the account of shared activity within a particular\ntheory ought to depend at least in part on that theory’s\nunderstanding of the kind of intimacy relevant to friendship. And this\ngenerally seems to be the case: for example, Thomas (1987, 1989, 1993,\n2013), who argues for a weak conception of intimacy in terms of mutual\nself-disclosure, has little place for shared activity in his account\nof friendship, whereas Sherman (1987), who argues for a strong\nconception of intimacy in terms of shared values, deliberation, and\nthought, provides within friendship a central place not just to\nisolated shared activities but, more significantly, to a shared\nlife. \nNonetheless, within the literature on friendship the notion of shared\nor joint activity is taken for granted: not much thought has been\ngiven to articulating clearly the sense in which friends share their\nactivity. This is surprising and unfortunate, especially insofar as\nthe understanding of the sense in which such activities are\n“shared” is closely related to the understanding of\nintimacy that is so central to any account of friendship; indeed, a\nclear account of the sort of shared activity characteristic of\nfriendship may in turn shed light on the sort of intimacy it involves.\nThis means in part that a particular theory of friendship might be\ncriticized in terms of the way in which its account of the intimacy of\nfriendship yields a poor account of the sense in which activity is\nshared. For example, one might think that we must distinguish between\nactivity we engage in together in part out of my concern for someone I\nlove, and activity we share insofar as we engage in it at\nleast partly for the sake of sharing it; only the latter, it might be\nargued, is the sort of shared activity constitutive of the\nrelationship of friendship as opposed to that constitutive\nmerely of my concern for him (see Nozick 1989). Consequently,\naccording to this line of thought, any account of the intimacy of\nfriendship that fails to understand the sharing of interests in such a\nway as to make sense of this distinction ought to be rejected. \nHelm (2008) develops an account of shared activity and shared valuing\nat least partly with an eye to understanding friendship. He argues\nthat the sense in which friends share activity is not the sort of\nshared intention and plural subjecthood discussed in literature on\nshared intention within social philosophy (on which, see Tuomela 1995,\n2007; Gilbert 1996, 2000, 2006; Searle 1990; and Bratman 1999), for\nsuch sharing of intentions does not involve the requisite intimacy of\nfriendship. Rather, the intimacy of friendship should be understood\npartly in terms of the friends forming a “plural agent”: a\ngroup of people who have joint cares—a joint evaluative\nperspective—which he analyzes primarily in terms of a pattern of\ninterpersonally connected emotions, desires, judgments, and (shared)\nactions. Friendships emerge, Helm claims, when the friends form a\nplural agent that cares positively about their relationship, and the\nvariety of kinds of friendships there can be, including friendships of\npleasure, utility, and virtue, are to be understood in terms of the\nparticular way in which they jointly understand their relationship to\nbe something they care about—as tennis buddies or as life\npartners, for example. \nFriendship clearly plays an important role in our lives; to a large\nextent, the various accounts of friendship aim at identifying and\nclarifying that role. In this context, it is important to understand\nnot only why friendship can be valuable, but also what justifies\nparticular friendships. \nOne way to construe the question of the value of friendship is in\nterms of the individual considering whether to be (or continue to\nbe) engaged in a friendship: why should I invest considerable time,\nenergy, and resources in a friend rather than in myself? What makes\nfriendship worthwhile for me, and so how ought I to evaluate whether\nparticular friendships I have are good friendships or not? \nOne sort of answer is that friendship is instrumentally good. Thus,\nTelfer (1970–71) claims that friendship is “life\nenhancing” in that it makes us “feel more\nalive”—it enhances our activities by intensifying our\nabsorption in them and hence the pleasure we get out of them\n(239–40). Moreover, she claims, friendship is pleasant in itself\nas well as useful to the friends. Annis (1987) adds that it helps\npromote self-esteem, which is good both instrumentally and for its own\nsake. \nYet friendship is not merely instrumentally valuable, as is hinted at\nby Annis’ claim that “our lives would be significantly\nless full given the universal demise of friendship” (1987, 351).\nCooper (1977b), interpreting Aristotle, provides two arguments for why\nthis might be so. First, Cooper’s Aristotle claims, living well\nrequires that one know the goodness of one’s own life; however,\ngiven the perpetual possibility of self-deception, one is able\naccurately to evaluate one’s own life only through friendship,\nin which one’s friend acts as a kind of mirror of one’s\nself. Hence, a flourishing life is possible only through the epistemic\naccess friendship provides. Second, Cooper’s Aristotle\nclaims that the sort of shared activity characteristic of friendship\nis essential to one’s being able to engage in the sort of\nactivities characteristic of living well “continuously”\nand “with pleasure and interest” (310). Such activities\ninclude moral and intellectual activities, activities in which it is\noften difficult to sustain interest without being tempted to act\notherwise. Friendship, and the shared values and shared activities it\nessentially involves, is needed to reinforce our intellectual and\npractical understanding of such activities as worthwhile in spite of\ntheir difficulty and the ever present possibility that our interest in\npursuing them will flag. Consequently, the shared activity of\nfriendship is partly constitutive of human flourishing. \nSo far these are attempts to understand the value of friendship to the\nindividual in terms of the way friendship contributes, instrumentally\nor constitutively, to something else that is valuable to the\nindividual. Yet one might also think that friendship is valuable for\nits own sake. Schoeman (1985), partly in response to the individualism\nof other accounts of the value of friendship, claims that in\nfriendship the friends “become a unique community with a being\nand value of its own” (280): the intimacy of friendship results\nin “a way of being and acting in virtue of being united with\nanother” (281). Although this claim has intuitive appeal,\nSchoeman does not clearly explain what the value of that “unique\ncommunity” is or why it should have that value. Indeed, we ought\nto expect that fleshing out this claim would involve a substantive\nproposal concerning the nature of that community and how it can have a\nseparate (federated?—cf. Friedman 1998) existence and value.\nOnce again, the literature on shared intention and plural subjecthood\nis relevant here; see, for example, Gilbert 1989, 1996, 2000; Tuomela\n1984, 1995; Searle 1990; and Bratman 1999. \nA question closely related to this question of the value of friendship\nis that of what justifies my being friends with this person rather\nthan with someone else or no one at all. To a certain extent, answers\nto the question of the value of friendship might seem to provide\nanswers to the question of the justification of friendship. After all,\nif the value of friendship in general lies in the way it contributes\n(either instrumentally or constitutively) to a flourishing life for\nme, then it might seem that I can justify particular friendships in\nlight of the extent to which they contribute to my flourishing.\nNonetheless, this seems unacceptable because it suggests—what is\nsurely false—that friends are\n fungible.\n (To be fungible is to be replaceable by a relevantly similar\nobject without any loss of value.) That is, if my friend has certain\nproperties (including, perhaps, relational properties) in virtue of\nwhich I am justified in having her as my friend (because it is in\nvirtue of those properties that she contributes to my flourishing),\nthen on this view I would be equally justified in being friends with\nanyone else having relevantly similar properties, and so I would have\nno reason not to replace my current friend with someone else of this\nsort. Indeed, it might even be that I ought to “trade up”\nwhen someone other than my current friend exhibits the relevant\nfriendship-justifying properties to a greater degree than my friend\ndoes. This is surely objectionable as an understanding of\nfriendship. \nIn solving this problem of fungibility, philosophers have typically\nfocused on features of the historical relationship of friendship (cf.\nBrink 1999, quoted above). One approach might be found in\nSherman’s 1987 union account of friendship discussed above (this\ntype of view might be suggested by the account of the value of\nfriendship in Schoeman 1985). If my friend and I form a kind of union\nin virtue of our having a shared conception of how to live that is\nforged and maintained through a particular history of interaction and\nsharing of our lives, and if my sense of my values and identity\ntherefore depends on these being most fundamentally our values and\nidentity, then it is simply not possible to substitute another person\nfor my friend without loss. For this other person could not possibly\nshare the relevant properties of my friend, namely her\nhistorical relationship with me. However, the price of this solution\nto the problem of fungibility, as it arises both for friendship and\nfor love, is the worry about autonomy raised towards the end of\nSection 1.2 above. \nAn alternative solution is to understand these historical, relational\nproperties of my friend to be more directly relevant to the\njustification of our friendship. Thus, Whiting (1991) distinguishes\nthe reasons we have for initiating a friendship (which are, she\nthinks, impersonal in a way that allows for fungibility) from the\nreasons we have for sustaining a friendship; the latter, she suggests,\nare to be found in the history of concern we have for each other.\nHowever, it is unclear how the historical-relational properties can\nprovide any additional justification for friendship beyond that\nprovided by thinking about the value of friendship in general, which\ndoes not solve the fungibility problem. For the mere fact that this is\nmy friend does not seem to justify my continued friendship:\nwhen we imagine that my friend is going through a rough time so that\nhe loses those virtues justifying my initial friendship with him, why\nshouldn’t I just dump him and strike up a new friendship with\nsomeone who has those virtues? It is not clear how the appeal to\nhistorical properties of my friend or our friendship can provide an\nanswer. \nIn part the trouble here arises from tacit preconceptions concerning\nthe nature of justification. If we attempt to justify continued\nfriendship in terms of the friend’s being this particular\nperson, with a particular historical relationship to me, then it seems\nlike we are appealing to merely idiosyncratic and subjective\nproperties, which might explain but cannot justify that friendship.\nThis seems to imply that justification in general requires the appeal\nto the friend’s being a type of person, having general,\nobjective properties that others might share; this leads to the\nproblem of fungibility. Solving the problem, it might therefore seem,\nrequires somehow overcoming this preconception concerning\njustification—a task which no one has attempted in the\nliterature on friendship. \n(For further discussion of this problem of fungibility as it arises in\nthe context of love, as well as discussion of a related problem\nconcerning whether the object (rather than the grounds) of love is a\nparticular person or a type of person, see Section 6 of the entry on\n love.) \nAnother way to construe the question of the value of friendship is in\nmore social terms: what is the good to society of having its members\nengaged in relationships of friendship? Telfer (1970–71, 238)\nanswers that friendship promotes the general good “by providing\na degree and kind of consideration for others’ welfare which\ncannot exist outside it.” Blum (1980) concurs, arguing that\nfriendship is an important source of moral excellence precisely\nbecause it essentially involves acting for the sake of your friend, a\nkind of action that can have considerable moral worth. (For similar\nclaims, see Annis 1987.) \nCocking & Kennett (2000) argue against this view that friendly\nacts per se are morally good, claiming that “I might be\na perfectly good friend. I might just not be a perfectly moral\none” (287). They support this conclusion, within their account\nof friendship as involving being directed and interpreted by\none’s friend, by claiming that “I am just as likely to be\ndirected by your interest in gambling at the casino as by your\ninterest in ballet” (286). However, Cocking & Kennett seem\nto be insufficiently sensitive to the idea, which they accept (cf.\n284), that friends care about promoting each other’s well-being.\nFor if I am concerned with your well-being and find you to be about to\nembark on an immoral course of action, I ought not, contrary to what\nCocking & Kennett suggest, blindly allow you to draw me into\njoining you; rather, I ought to try to stop you or at least get you to\nquestion whether you are doing the right thing—as a matter of my\ndirecting and interpreting you. In this context, Koltonski (2016)\nargues that one ought to ensure that one’s friend is properly\nengaging in moral deliberation, but then defer to one’s\nfriend’s judgment about what to do, even when one disagrees with\nthe moral conclusion, for such deference is a matter of properly\nrespecting the friend’s moral agency. \nThese answers to the social value of friendship seem to apply equally\nwell to love: insofar as love essentially involves both a concern for\nyour beloved for his sake and, consequently, action on his behalf for\nhis sake, love will exhibit the same social value. Friedman (1989),\nhowever, argues that friendship itself is socially valuable in a way\nthat love is not. Understanding the intimacy of friendship in terms of\nthe sharing of values, Friedman notes that friendship can involve the\nmutual support of, in particular, unconventional values, which can be\nan important stimulus to moral progress within a community. For\n“our commitments to particular persons are, in practice,\nnecessary counterbalances to our commitments to abstract\nmoral guidelines, and may, at times, take precedence over them”\n(6). Consequently, the institution of friendship is valuable not just\nto the individuals but also to the community as a whole. \nA growing body of research since the mid-1970s questions the\nrelationship between the phenomenon of friendship and particular moral\ntheories. Thus, many (Stocker 1976, 1981; Blum 1980, 1993; Wilcox\n1987; Friedman 1989, 1993; Badhwar 1991; Cocking & Oakley 1995)\nhave criticized consequentialist and deontological moral theories on\nthe grounds that they are somehow incompatible with friendship and the\nkind of reasons and motives that friendship provides. Often, the\nappeal to friendship is intended to bypass traditional disputes among\nmajor types of moral theories (consequentialism, deontology, and\nvirtue ethics), and so the “friendship critique” may seem\nespecially important and\n interesting.[7] \nAt the root of these questions concerning the relationship between\nfriendship and morality is the idea that friendship involves\nspecial duties: duties for specific people that arise out of\nthe relationship of friendship. Thus, it seems that we have\nobligations to aid and support our friends that go well beyond those\nwe have to help strangers because they are our friends, much like we\nparents have special duties to aid and support our children because\nthey are our children. Indeed, Annis (1987) suggests, such duties\n“are constitutive of the relationship” of friendship (352;\nbut see Bernstein (2007) for an argument that friendship does not\ninvolve any requirement of partiality). Given this, the question\narises as to what the relationship is between such special duties of\nfriendship and other duties, in particular moral duties: can our\nobligations to our friends sometimes trump our moral duties, or must\nwe always subordinate our personal relationships to morality in order\nto be properly impartial (as, it might be thought, morality\ndemands)? \nOne concern in this neighborhood, articulated by Stocker (1976), is\nthat the phenomenon of friendship reveals that consequentialist and\ndeontological moral theories, by offering accounts of what it is right\nto do irrespective of the motives we have, promote a kind of\n“moral schizophrenia”: a split between our moral\nreasons on the one hand and our motives on the other. Such moral\nschizophrenia, Stocker argues, prevents us in general from harmonizing\nour moral reasons and our motives, and it does so in a way that\ndestroys the very possibility of our having and sustaining friendships\nwith others. Given the manifest value of friendship in our lives, this\nis clearly a serious problem with these moral theories. \nWhat is it about friendship that generates these problems? One concern\narises out of the teleological conception of action, implicit\nin consequentialism, according to which actions are understood in\nterms of their ends or purposes. The trouble is, Stocker (1981)\nargues, the characteristic actions of friendship cannot be understood\nin this way. To be a friend is at least sometimes to be motivated to\nact out of a concern for your friend as this individual (cf.\n Section 1.1).\n Although actions done out of friendship may have ends, what\ncharacterizes these as “friendly acts,” as we might call\nthem, is not that they are done for any particular purpose: \nThat is, actions done out of friendship are essentially actions\nmotivated by a special sort of concern—a concern for this\nparticular person—which is in part a matter of having settled\nhabits of response to the friend. This, Stocker concludes, is a kind\nof motivation for action that a teleological conception of action\ncannot countenance, resulting in moral schizophrenia. (Jeske (2008)\nargues for a somewhat different conclusion: that in order to heal this\napparent split between impartial moral obligations and the partial\nobligations of friendship, we must abandon the distinction between\nmoral and nonmoral obligations.) \nStocker (1976) raises another, more general concern for\nconsequentialism and deontology arising out of a conception of\nfriendship. Thus, although act consequentialists—those\nwho justify each particular act by appeal to the goodness of the\nconsequences of that act, impersonally conceived (see the entry on\n consequentialism)—could\n justify friendly acts, they “cannot embody their reason in\ntheir motive” (1976, 70), for to be motivated teleologically by\nthe concern to maximize goodness is not to be motivated out of\nfriendship. Consequently, either act consequentialists must exhibit\nmoral schizophrenia, or, to avoid it, they must understand\nconsequentialist reasons for action to be our motives. However,\nbecause such consequentialist reasons are impersonal, taking this\nlatter tack would be to leave out the kind of reasons and motives that\nare central to friendship, thereby undermining the very institution of\nfriendship. (Cf. the discussion of impersonal justification of\nfriendship and the problem of fungibility in\n Section 2.1.) \nThe same is true, Stocker argues, of rule consequentialism\n(the view that actions are right if they follow principles or rules\nthat tend to result in the most good overall, impersonally\nconceived—see the entry on\n rule-consequentialism)\n and on deontology (the view that actions are right just in\ncase they are in accordance with certain rules or principles that are\nbinding on all moral agents). For even if rule consequentialism and\ndeontology can provide moral reasons for friendly actions in terms of\nthe rule that one must benefit one’s friends, for example, such\nreasons would be impersonal, giving no special consideration to our\nparticular friends at all. If we are to avoid moral schizophrenia and\nembody this reason in our motives for action, we could not, then, act\nout of friendship—out of a concern for our friends for their\nsakes. This means that any rule consequentialist or deontologist that\navoids moral schizophrenia can act so as to benefit her friends, but\nsuch actions would be merely as if friendly, not genuinely\nfriendly, and she could not therefore have and sustain genuine\nfriendships. The only alternative is to split her moral reasons and\nher motives for friendly acts, thereby becoming schizophrenic. (For\nsome discussion about whether such moral schizophrenia really is as\nbad as Stocker thinks, see Woodcock 2010. For concerns similar to\nStocker’s about impartial moral theories and motivation for\naction arising out of a consideration of personal relationships like\nfriendship, see Williams 1981.) \nBlum (1980) (portions of which are reprinted with slight modifications\nin Blum 1993) and Friedman (1993), pick up on this contrast between\nthe impartiality of consequentialism and deontology and the inherent\npartiality of friendship, and argue more directly for a rejection of\nsuch moral theories. Consequentialists and deontologists must think\nthat relationships like friendship essentially involve a kind of\nspecial concern for the friend and that such relationships therefore\ndemand that one’s actions exhibit a kind of partiality towards\nthe friend. Consequently, they argue, these impartialist moral\ntheories must understand friendship to be inherently biased and\ntherefore not to be inherently moral. Rather, such moral theories can\nonly claim that to care for another “in a fully morally\nappropriate manner” requires caring for him “simply as a\nhuman being, i.e., independent of any special connection or attachment\none has with him” (Blum 1993, 206). It is this claim that Blum\nand Friedman deny: although such universalist concern surely has a\nplace in moral theory, the value—indeed the moral value (cf.\n Section 2.2)—of\n friendship cannot properly be appreciated except as involving a\nconcern for another for his sake and as the particular person he is.\nThus, they claim, insofar as consequentialism and deontology are\nunable to acknowledge the moral value of friendship, they cannot be\nadequate moral theories and ought to be rejected in favor of some\nalternative. \nIn reply, Railton (1984) distinguishes between subjective and\nobjective consequentialism, arguing that this “friendship\ncritique” of Stocker and Blum (as well as Friedman) succeeds\nonly against subjective consequentialism. (See Mason (1998) for\nfurther elaborations of this argument, and see Sadler (2006) for an\nalternative response.) Subjective consequentialism is the\nview that whenever we face a choice of actions, we should both morally\njustify a particular course of action and be motivated to act\naccordingly directly by the relevant consequentialist principle\n(whether what that principle assesses are particular actions or rules\nfor action). That is, in acting as one ought, one’s subjective\nmotivations ought to come from those very moral reasons: because this\naction promotes the most good (or is in accordance with the rule that\ntends to promote the most good). Clearly, Stocker, Blum, and Friedman\nare right to think that subjective consequentialism cannot properly\naccommodate the motives of friendship. \nBy contrast, Railton argues, objective consequentialism\ndenies that there is such a tight connection between the objective\njustification of a state of affairs in terms of its consequences and\nthe agent’s motives in acting: the moral justification of a\nparticular action is one thing (and to be undertaken in\nconsequentialist terms), but the motives for that action may be\nentirely separate. This means that the objective consequentialist can\nproperly acknowledge that sometimes the best states of affairs result\nnot just from undertaking certain behaviors, but from undertaking them\nwith certain motives, including motives that are essentially personal.\nIn particular, Railton argues, the world would be a better place if\neach of us had dispositions to act so as to benefit our friends out of\na concern for their good (and not the general good). So, on\nconsequentialist grounds each of us has moral reasons to inculcate\nsuch a disposition to friendliness, and when the moment arrives that\ndisposition will be engaged, so that we are motivated to act out of a\nconcern for our friends rather than out of an impersonal, impartial\nconcern for the greater\n good.[8]\n Moreover, there is no split between our moral reasons for action and\nour motives because such reasons may in some cases (such as that of a\nfriendly act) require that in acting we act out of the appropriate\nsort of motive. So the friendship critique of Stocker, Blum, and\nFriedman\n fails.[9] \nBadhwar (1991) thinks even Railton’s more sophisticated\nconsequentialism ultimately fails to accommodate the phenomenon of\nfriendship, and that the moral schizophrenia remains. For, she argues,\na sophisticated consequentialist must both value the friend for the\nfriend’s sake (in order to be a friend at all) and value the\nfriend only so long as doing so is consistent with promoting the most\ngood overall (in order to be a consequentialist). \nBadhwar is here alluding to a case of Railton’s in which,\nthrough no fault of yours or your friend’s, the right action\naccording to consequentialism is to sacrifice your friendship for the\ngreater good. In such a case, the sophisticated consequentialist must\nin arriving at this conclusion “evaluate intrinsic goods [of\nfriendship] and their virtues by reference to a standard external to\nthem”—i.e., by reference to the overall good as this is\nconceived from an impersonal point of view (496). However, Badhwar\nargues, the value of friendship is something we can appreciate only\nfrom a personal point of view, so that the moral rightness of friendly\nactions must be assessed only by appeal to an essentially personal\nrelationship in which we act for the sake of our friends and not for\nthe sake of producing the most good in general and in indifference to\nthis particular personal relationship. Therefore, sophisticated\nconsequentialism, because of its impersonal nature, blinds us to the\nvalue of particular friendships and the moral reasons they provide for\nacting out of friendship, all of which can be properly appreciated\nonly from the personal point of view. In so doing, sophisticated\nconsequentialism undermines what is distinctive about friendship as\nsuch. The trouble once again is a split between consequentialist\nreasons and friendly motivations: a kind of moral schizophrenia. \nAt this point it might seem that the proper consequentialist reply to\nthis line of criticism is to refuse to accept the claim that a moral\njustification of the value of friendship and friendly actions must be\npersonal: the good of friendship and the good that friendly actions\npromote, a consequentialist should say, are things we must be able to\nunderstand in impersonal terms or they would not enter into a properly\nmoral justification of the rightness of action. Because\nsophisticated consequentialists agree that motivation out of\nfriendship must be personal, they must reject the idea that the\nultimate moral reasons for acting in these cases are your motives,\nthereby rejecting the relatively weak motivational internalism that is\nimplicit in the friendship critique (for weak motivational\ninternalism, see the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism,\n and in particular the section on\n motivational internalism and the action-guiding character of moral judgements).\n Indeed, this seems to be Railton’s strategy in articulating his\nobjective consequentialism: to be a good person is to act in\nthe morally right ways (justified by consequentialism) and so to have,\non balance, motivations that tend to produce right action, even though\nin certain cases (including those of friendship) these motivations\nneed not—indeed cannot—have the consequentialist\njustification in view. (For further elaborations of this strategy in\ndirect response to Badhwar 1991, see Conee 2001 and Card 2004; for a\ndefense of Railton in opposition to Card’s elaboration of\nsophisticated consequentialism, see Tedesco 2006.) \nThis means that the debate at issue in the friendship critique of\nconsequentialism needs to be carried on in part at the level of a\ndiscussion of the nature of motivation and the connection between\nmoral reasons and motives. Indeed, such a discussion has implications\nfor how we should construe the sort of mutual caring that is central\nto friendship. For the sophisticated consequentialist would presumably\ntry to spell out that mutual caring in terms of friendly dispositions\n(motives divorced from consequentialist reasons), an attempt which\nadvocates of the friendship critique would say involves insufficient\nattention to the particular person one cares about, insofar as the\ncaring would not be justified by who she is (motives informed by\npersonal reasons). \nThe discussion of friendship and moral theories has so far\nconcentrated on the nature of practical reason. A similar debate\nfocuses on the nature of value. Scanlon (1998) uses friendship to\nargue against what he calls teleological conceptions of values\npresupposed by consequentialism. The teleological view understands\nstates of affairs to have intrinsic value, and our recognition of such\nvalue provides us with reasons to bring such states of affairs into\nexistence and to sustain and promote them. Scanlon argues that\nfriendship involves kinds of reasons—of loyalty, for\nexample—are not teleological in this way, and so the value of\nfriendship does not fit into the teleological conception and so cannot\nbe properly recognized by consequentialism. In responding to this\nargument, Hurka (2006) argues that this argument presupposes\na conception of the value of friendship (as something we ought to\nrespect as well as to promote) that is at odds with the teleological\nconception of value and so with teleological conceptions of\nfriendship. Consequently, the debate must shift to the more general\nquestion about the nature of value and cannot be carried out simply by\nattending to friendship. \nThese conclusions that we must turn to broader issues if we are to\nsettle the place friendship has in morality reveal that in one sense\nthe friendship critique has failed: it has not succeeded in making an\nend run around traditional debates between consequentialists,\ndeontologists, and virtue theorists. Yet in a larger sense it has\nsucceeded: it has forced these moral theories to take personal\nrelationships seriously and consequently to refine and complicate\ntheir accounts in the process.","contact.mail":"bennett.helm@fandm.edu","contact.domain":"fandm.edu"}]
