That reality can be an individual, a state\nof affairs, a fact, or even an absence, depending on the religious\ntradition the experience is a part of. A wide variety of kinds of\nexperience fall under the general rubric of religious experience. The\nconcept is vague, and the multiplicity of kinds of experiences that\nfall under it makes it difficult to capture in any general account. Part\nof that vagueness comes from the term ‘religion,’ which is\ndifficult to define in any way that does not either rule out\ninstitutions that clearly are religions, or include terms that can only\nbe understood in the light of a prior understanding of what religions\nare. Nevertheless, we can make some progress in elucidating the concept\nby distinguishing it from distinct but related concepts.\n\n\nFirst, religious experience is to be distinguished from religious\nfeelings, in the same way that experience in general is to be\ndistinguished from feelings in general. A feeling of elation, for\nexample, even if it occurs in a religious context, does not count in\nitself as a religious experience, even if the subject later comes to\nthink that the feeling was caused by some objective reality of\nreligious significance. An analogy with sense experience is helpful\nhere. If a subject feels a general feeling of happiness, not on account\nof anything in particular, and later comes to believe the feeling was\ncaused by the presence of a particular person, that fact does not\ntransform the feeling of happiness into a perception of the person.\nJust as a mental event, to be a perception of an object, must in\nsome sense seem to be an experience of that object, a\nreligiously oriented mental event, to be a religious experience, must\nin some way seem to be an experience of a religiously\nsignificant reality. So, although religious feelings may be involved in\nmany, or even most, religious experiences, they are not the same thing.\nDiscussions of religious experience in terms of feelings, like\nSchleiermacher’s (1998) “feeling of absolute\ndependence,” or Otto’s (1923) feeling of the numinous, were\nimportant early contributions to theorizing about religious experience,\nbut some have since then argued (see Gellman 2001 and Alston 1991, for\nexample) that religious affective states are not all there is to\nreligious experience. To account for the experiences qua\nexperiences, we must go beyond subjective feelings.\n\n Religious experience is also to be distinguished from mystical\nexperience. Although there is obviously a close connection between the\ntwo, and mystical experiences are religious experiences, not all\nreligious experiences qualify as mystical. The word\n‘mysticism’ has been understood in many different ways.\nJames (1902) took mysticism to necessarily involve ineffability, which\nwould rule out many cases commonly understood to be mystical.  Alston\n(1991) adopted the term grudgingly as the best of a bad lot and gave\nit a semi-technical meaning. But in its common, non-technical sense,\nmysticism is a specific religious system or practice, deliberately\nundertaken in order to come to some realization or insight, to come to\nunity with the divine, or to experience the ultimate reality\ndirectly. At the very least, religious experiences form a broader\ncategory; many religious experiences, like those of Saint Paul,\nArjuna, Moses, Muhammad, and many others come unsought, not as the\nresult of some deliberate practice undertaken to produce an\nexperience.\n\n\n\nReports of religious experiences reveal a variety of different\nkinds. Perhaps most are visual or auditory presentations (visions and\nauditions), but not through the physical eyes or ears. Subjects report\n“seeing” or “hearing,” but quickly disavow any\nclaim to seeing or hearing with bodily sense organs. Such experiences\nare easy to dismiss as hallucinations, but the subjects of the\nexperience frequently claim that though it is entirely internal, like a\nhallucination or imagination, it is nevertheless a veridical\nexperience, through some spiritual analog of the eye or ear (James 1902\nand Alston 1991 cite many examples). In other cases, the language of\n“seeing” is used in its extended sense of realization, as\nwhen a yogi is said to “see” his or her identity with\nBrahman; Buddhists speak of “seeing things as they are” as\none of the hallmarks of true enlightenment, where this means grasping\nor realizing the emptiness of things, but not in a purely intellectual\nway. Another type is the religious experience that comes through\nsensory experiences of ordinary objects, but seems to carry with it\nextra information about some supramundane reality. Examples include\nexperiencing God in nature, in the starry sky, or a flower, or the\nlike. A second person standing nearby would see exactly the same sky or\nflower, but would not necessarily have the further religious content to\nhis or her experience. There are also cases in which the religious\nexperience just is an ordinary perception, but the physical object is\nitself the object of religious significance. Moses’s experience\nof the burning bush, or the Buddha’s disciples watching him\nlevitate, are examples of this type. A second person standing nearby\nwould see exactly the same phenomenon. Witnesses to miracles are having\nthat kind of religious experience, whether they understand it that way\nor not. A fourth type of religious experience is harder to describe:\nit can’t be characterized accurately in sensory language, even\nanalogically, yet the subject of the experience insists that the\nexperience is a real, direct awareness of some religiously significant\nreality external to the subject. These kinds of experiences are usually\ndescribed as “ineffable.” Depending on one’s\npurposes, other ways of dividing up religious experiences will suggest\nthemselves. For example, William James (1902) divides experiences into\n“healthy-minded” and “sick-minded,” according\nto the personality of the subject, which colors the content of the\nexperience itself. Keith Yandell (1993, 25–32) divided them into five\ncategories, according to the content of the experiences: monotheistic,\nnirvanic (enlightenment experiences associated with Buddhism), kevalic\n(enlightenment experiences associated with Jainism), moksha\n(experiences of release from karma, associated with Hinduism), and\nnature experiences. Differences of object certainly make differences in\ncontent, and so make differences in what can be said about the\nexperiences. See section four for further discussion of this\nissue. \n\nMany have thought that there is some special problem with religious\nlanguage, that it can’t be meaningful in the same way that\nordinary language is. The Logical Positivists claimed that\nlanguage is meaningful only insofar as it is moored in our experiences\nof the physical world. Since we can’t account for religious\nlanguage by linking it to experiences of the physical world, such\nlanguage is meaningless. Even though religious claims look in\nevery way like ordinary assertions about the world, their lack of\nempirical consequences makes them meaningless. The principle of\nverification went through many formulations as it faced\ncriticism. But if it is understood as a claim about meaning in\nordinary language, it seems to be self-undermining, since there is no\nempirical way to verify it. Eventually, that approach to language\nfell out of favor, but some still use a modified, weaker version to\ncriticize religious language. For example, Antony Flew (Flew and\nMacIntyre, 1955) relies on a principle to the effect that if a claim is\nnot falsifiable, it is somehow illegitimate. Martin (1990) and Nielsen\n(1985) invoke a principle that combines verifiability and\nfalsifiability; to be meaningful, a claim must be one or the other. It\nis not clear that even these modifed and weakened versions of the\nverification principle entirely escape self-undermining. Even if\nthey do, they seem to take other kinds of language with them—like\nmoral language, talk about the future or past, and talk about the\ncontents of others’ minds — that we might be loath to lose.\nMoreover, to deny the meaningfulness of religious-experience claims on\nthe grounds that it is not moored in experience begs the question, in\nthat it assumes that religious experiences are not real\nexperiences. \nAnother possibility is to allow that religious claims are\nmeaningful, but they are not true or false, because they should not be\nunderstood as assertions. Braithwaite (1970), for example,\nunderstands religious claims to be expressions of commitments to sets\nof values. On such a view, what appears to be a claim about a\nreligious experience is not in fact a claim at all. It might be\nthat some set of mental events, with which the experience itself can be\nidentified, would be the ground and prompting of the claim, but it\nwould not properly be what the claim is about. \nA second challenge to religious-experience claims comes from\nWittgensteinian accounts of language. Wittgenstein (1978) muses at some\nlength on the differences between how ordinary language is used, and\nhow religious language is used. Others (see Phillips 1970, for\nexample), following Wittgenstein, have tried to give an explanation of\nthe strangeness of religious language by invoking the idea of a\nlanguage-game. Each language-game has its own rules, including its own\nprocedures for verification. As a result, it is a mistake to treat it\nlike ordinary language, expecting evidence in the ordinary sense, in\nthe same way that it would be a mistake to ask for the evidence for a\njoke. “I saw God” should not be treated in the same way as\n“I saw Elvis.” Some even go so far as to say the religious\nlanguage-game is isolated from other practices, such that it would be a\nmistake to derive any claims about history, geography, or cosmology\nfrom them, never mind demand the same kind of evidence for them. On\nthis view, religious experiences should not be treated as comparable to\nsense experiences, but that does not entail that they are not\nimportant, nor that they are not in some sense veridical, in that they\ncould still be avenues for important insights about reality. Such\na view can be attributed to D. Z. Phillips (1970). \nWhile this may account for some of the unusual aspects of religious\nlanguage, it certainly does not capture what many religious people\nthink about the claims they make. As creationism illustrates, many\nreligious folk think it is perfectly permissible to draw empirical\nconclusions from religious doctrine. Hindus and Buddhists for many\ncenturies thought there was a literal Mount Meru in the middle of the\n(flat, disc-shaped) world. It would be very odd if “The\nBuddha attained enlightenment under the bo tree” had to be given\na very different treatment from “The Buddha ate rice under the bo\ntree” because the first is a religious claim and the second is an\nordinary empirical claim. There are certainly entailment relations\nbetween religious and non-religious claims, too: “Jesus died for\nmy sins” straightforwardly entails “Jesus died.” \n\nSince the subjects of religious experiences tend to take them to be\nreal experiences of some external reality, we may ask what reason there\nis to think they are right. That is to say, do religious experiences\namount to good reasons for religious belief? One answer to that\nquestion is what is often called the Argument from Religious\nExperience: Religious experiences are in all relevant respects like\nsensory experiences; sensory experiences are excellent grounds for\nbeliefs about the physical world; so religious experiences are\nexcellent grounds for religious beliefs. This argument, or one very\nlike it, can be found in Swinburne (1979), Alston (1991), Plantinga\n(1981, 2000), and others. Critics of this approach generally find ways\nin which religious experiences are different from sensory experiences,\nand argue that those differences are enough to undermine the evidential\nvalue of the experiences. Swinburne (1979) invokes what he calls\nthe “Principle of Credulity,” according to which one is\njustified in believing that what seems to one to be present actually is\npresent, unless some appropriate defeater is operative. He then\ndiscusses a variety of circumstances that would be defeaters in the\nordinary sensory case, and argues that those defeaters do not obtain,\nor not always, in the case of religious experience. To reject his\nargument, one would have to show that religious experience is unlike\nsensory experience in that in the religious case, one or more of the\ndefeaters always obtains. Anyone who accepts the principle has\nexcellent reason to accept the deliverances of religious experience,\nunless he or she believes that defeaters always, or almost always,\nobtain. \nPlantinga offers a different kind of argument. According to\nCartesian-style foundationalism, in order to count as justified, a\nbelief must either be grounded in other justified beliefs, or derive \nits justification from some special status, like\ninfallibility, incorrigibility, or indubitability. There is a parallel\nview about knowledge. Plantinga (1981) argued that such a\nfoundationalism is inconsistent with holding one’s own\nordinary beliefs about the world to be justified (or knowledge),\nbecause our ordinary beliefs derived from sense-experience aren’t\nderived from anything infallible, indubitable, or incorrigible. In\nfact, we typically treat them as foundational, in need of no further\njustification. If we hold sensory beliefs to be properly basic, then we\nhave to hold similarly formed religious beliefs, formed on experiences\nof God manifesting himself to a believer (Plantinga calls them\n‘M-beliefs’), as properly basic. He proposed that human\nbeings have a faculty—what John Calvin called the\n‘sensus divinitatis’—that allows them to be\naware of God’s actions or dispositions with respect to them. If\nbeliefs formed by sense-experience can be properly basic, then beliefs\nformed by this faculty cannot, in any principled way, be denied that\nsame status. His developed theory of warrant (2000) implies that, if\nthe beliefs are true, then they are warranted. One cannot attack claims\nof religious experience without first addressing the question as to\nwhether the religious claims are true. He admits that, since there are\npeople in other religious traditions who have based beliefs about\nreligious matters on similar purported manifestations,\nthey may be able to make the same argument about their own religious\nexperiences. \nAlston develops a general theory of doxastic practices\n(constellations of belief-forming mechanisms, together with\ncharacteristic background assumptions and sets of defeaters), gives an\naccount of what it is to rationally engage in such a practice, and then\nargues that at least the practice of forming beliefs on the basis of\nChristian religious experiences fulfills those requirements. If\nwe think of the broad doxastic practices we currently employ, we see\nthat some of them can be justified by the use of other practices.\nThe practice of science, for example, reduces mostly to the\npractices of sense-perception, deductive reasoning, and inductive\nreasoning (memory and testimony also make contributions, of\ncourse). The justificatory status the practice gives to its product\nbeliefs derives from those more basic practices.  Most, however,\ncannot be so reduced. How are they justified, then? It seems that they\ncannot be justified non-circularly, that is, without the use of\npremises derived from the practices themselves. Our only justification\nfor continuing to trust these practices is that they are firmly\nestablished, interwoven with other practices and projects of ours, and\nhave “stood the test of time” by producing mostly\nconsistent sets of beliefs. They produce a sufficiently consistent set\nof beliefs if they don’t produce massive, unavoidable\ncontradictions on central matters, either internally, or with the\noutputs of other equally well-established practices. If that’s\nall there is to be said about our ordinary practices, then we ought to\nextend the same status to other practices that have the same features.\nHe then argues that the Christian practice of belief-formation on the\nbasis of religious experience does have those features. Like\nPlantinga, he admits that such an argument might be equally available\nto other religious practices; it all depends on whether the practice\nin question generates massive and unavoidable contradictions, on\ncentral matters, either internally, or with other equally\nwell-established practices. To undermine this argument, one would have\nto show either that Alston’s criteria for rationality of a\npractice are too permissive, or that religious practices never escape\nmassive contradictions. \nBoth Plantinga’s and Alston’s defense of the epistemic\nvalue of religious experiences turn crucially on some degree of\nsimilarity with sense-experience. But they are not simple\narguments from analogy; not just any similarities will do to make the\npositive argument, and not just any dissimilarities will do to defeat\nthe argument. The similarities or dissimilarities need to be\nepistemologically relevant. It is not enough, for example, to\nshow that religious experiences do not typically allow for independent\npublic verification, unless one wants to give up on other perfectly\nrespectable practices, like rational intuition, that also lack\nthat feature.  The two most important defeaters on the table for claims of the\nepistemic authority of religious experience are the fact of religious\ndiversity, and the availability of naturalistic explanations for\nreligious experiences. Religious diversity is a prima facie defeater\nfor the veridicality of religious experiences in the same way that\nwildly conflicting eyewitness reports undermine each other.  If the\nreports are at all similar, then it may be reasonable to conclude that\nthere is some truth to the testimony, at least in broad outline. A\nversion of this objection is the argument from divine hiddenness\n(cf. Lovering 2013). If God exists, and shows himself to some people\nin religious experiences, then the fact that he doesn’t do so\nfor more people, more widely distributed, requires some\nexplanation. But if two eyewitness reports disagree on the most basic\nfacts about what happened, then it seems that neither gives you good\ngrounds for any beliefs about what happened. It certainly seems that\nthe contents of religious-experience reports are radically different\nfrom one another. Some subjects of religious experiences report\nexperience of nothingness as the ultimate reality, some a vast\nimpersonal consciousness in which we all participate, some an\ninfinitely perfect, personal creator. To maintain that one’s own\nreligious experiences are veridical, one would have to a) find some\ncommon core to all these experiences, such that in spite of\ndifferences of detail, they could reasonably be construed as\nexperiences of the same reality, or b) insist that one’s own\nexperiences are veridical, and that therefore those of other\ntraditions are not veridical. The first is difficult to manage, in the\nface of the manifest differences across religions. Nevertheless, John\nHick (1989) develops a view of that kind, making use of a Kantian\ntwo-worlds epistemology. The idea is that the object of these\nexperiences, in itself, is one and the same reality, but it is\nexperienced phenomenally by different people differently. Thus, is\npossible to see how one and the same object can be experienced in ways\nthat are completely incompatible with one another. This approach is\nonly as plausible as the Kantian framework itself is. Jerome Gellman\n(2001) proposes a similar idea, without the Kantian baggage. Solutions\nlike these leave the problem untouched: If the different practices\nproduce experiences the contents of which are inconsistent with one\nanother, one of the practices must be unreliable. Alston (1991) and\nPlantinga (2000) develop the second kind of answer. The general\nstrategy is to argue that, from within a tradition, a person acquires\nepistemic resources not available to those outside the tradition, just\nas travelling to the heart of a jungle allows one to see things that\nthose who have not made the journey can’t see. As a result, even\nif people in other traditions can make the same argument, it is still\nreasonable to say that some are right and the others are wrong. The\nthings that justify my beliefs still justify them, even if you have\ncomparable resources justifying a contrary view.  Naturalistic explanations for religious experiences are thought to\nundermine their epistemic value because, if the naturalistic\nexplanation is sufficient to explain the experience, we have no\ngrounds for positing anything beyond that naturalistic cause. Freud\n(1927) and Marx (1876/1977) are frequently held up as offering such\nexplanations. Freud claims that religious experiences can be\nadequately explained by psychological mechanisms having their root in\nearly childhood experience and psychodynamic tensions. Marx similarly\nattributes religious belief in general to materialistic economic\nforces. Both claim that, since the hidden psychological or economic\nexplanations are sufficient to explain the origins of religious\nbelief, there is no need to suppose, in addition, that the beliefs are\ntrue. Freud’s theory of religion has few adherents, even among\nthe psychoanalytically inclined, and Marx’s view likewise has\nall but been abandoned, but that is not to say that something in the\nneighborhood might not be true. More recently, neurological\nexplanations of religious experience have been put forward as reasons\nto deny the veridicality of the experiences. Events in the brain that\noccur during meditative states and other religious experiences are\nvery similar to events that happen during certain kinds of seizures,\nor with certain kinds of mental disorders, and can also be induced\nwith drugs. Therefore, it is argued, there is nothing more to\nreligious experiences than what happens in seizures, mental disorders,\nor drug experiences. Some who are studying the neurological basis of\nreligious experience do not infer that they are not veridical (see,\ne.g., d’Aquili and Newberg 1999), but many do. Guthrie (1995),\nfor example, argues that religion has its origin in our tendency to\nanthropomorphize phenomena in our vicinity, seeing agency where there\nis none. \nThere are general problems with all kinds of naturalistic\nexplanations as defeaters. First of all, as Gellman (2001) points\nout, most such explanations (like the psychoanalytic and\nsocio-political ones) are put forward as hypotheses, not as established\nfacts. The proponent assumes that the experiences are not\nveridical, then casts around for an explanation. This is not true\nof the neurological explanations, but they face another kind of\nweakness noted by Ellwood (1999): every experience, whatever\nits source, is accompanied by a corresponding neurological state.\nTo argue that the experience is illusory because there is a\ncorresponding brain state is fallacious. The same reasoning would\nlead us to conclude that sensory experiences are illusory, since in\neach sensory experience, there is some corresponding neurological state\nthat is just like the state that occurs in the corresponding\nhallucination. The proponent of the naturalistic explanation as a\ndefeater owes us some reason to believe that his or her argument is not\njust another skeptical argument from the veil of perception. \nOne further epistemological worry accompanies religious\nexperience. James claimed that, while mystical experiences proved\nauthoritative grounds for belief in the person experiencing them, they\ncannot give grounds for a person to whom the experience is\nreported. In other words, my experience is evidence for me, but\nnot for you. This claim can be understood in a variety of ways,\ndepending on the kind of normativity that attaches to the purported\nevidential relation. Some (see Oakes 1976, for example) have\nclaimed that religious experiences epistemically can necessitate\nbelief; that is, anyone who has the experience and doesn’t form\nthe corresponding belief is making an epistemic mistake, much like a\nperson who, in normal conditions, refuses to believe his or her\neyes. More commonly, defenders of the epistemic value of\nreligious experience claim that the experiences make it epistemically\npermissible to form the belief, but you may also be justified in not\nforming the belief. The testimony of other people about what they\nhave experienced is much the same. In some cases, a person would\nbe unjustified in rejecting the testimony of others, and in other\ncases, one would be justified in accepting it, but need not accept\nit. This leaves us with three possibilities, on the assumption\nthat the subject of the experience is justified in forming a religious\nbelief on the basis of his or her experience, and that he or she tells\nsomeone else about it: the testimony might provide compelling evidence\nfor the hearer, such that he or she would be unjustified in rejecting\nthe claim; the testimony might provide non-compelling justification for\nthe hearer to accept the claim; or the testimony might fail to provide\nany kind of grounds for the hearer to accept the claim. When a\nsubject makes a claim on the basis of an ordinary experience, it might\nfall into any one of these three categories, depending on the\nclaim’s content and the epistemic situation of the hearer.\nThe most natural thing to say about religious experience claims is that\nthey work the same way (on the assumption that they give the subject of\nthe experience, who is making the claim, any justification for his or\nher beliefs). James, and some others after him, claim that testimony\nabout religious experiences cannot fall under either of the first two\ncategories. If that’s true, it must be because of something\nspecial about the nature of the experiences. If we assume that the\nexperiences cannot be shown a priori to be defective somehow,\nand that religious language is intelligible—and if we do not make\nthese assumptions, then the question of religious testimony\ndoesn’t even arise—then it must be because the evidential\nvalue of the experience is so small that it cannot survive transmission\nto another person; that is, it must be that in the ordinary act of\nreporting an experience to someone else, there is some defeater at work\nthat is always stronger than whatever evidential force the experience\nitself has. While there are important differences between\nordinary sense-experience and religious experience (clarity of the\nexperience, amount of information it contains, presence of competing\nexplanations, and the like), it is not clear whether the differences\nare great enough to disqualify religious testimony always and\neverywhere. \n\nJust as there are a variety of religions, each with its own claims\nabout the nature of reality, there are a variety of objects and states\nof affairs that the subjects of these experiences claim to be aware\nof. Much analytic philosophy of religion has been done in Europe and\nthe nations descended from Europe, so much of the discussion has been\nin terms of God as conceived of in the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic\ntraditions. In those traditions, the object of religious experiences\nis typically God himself, understood as an eternal, omniscient,\nomnipotent, free, and perfectly good spirit. God, for reasons of his\nown, reveals himself to people, some of them unbidden (like Moses,\nMuhammad, and Saint Paul), and some because they have undertaken a\nrigorous practice to draw closer to him (like the mystics). To say\nthat an experience comes unbidden is not to say that nothing the\nsubject has done has prepared her, or primed her, for the experience\n(see Luhrmann 2012); it is only to claim that the subject has not\nundertaken any practice aimed at producing a religious experience. In\nsuch experiences, God frequently delivers a message at the same time,\nbut he need not. He is always identifiable as the same being who\nrevealed himself to others in the same tradition. Other experiences\ncan be of angels, demons, saints, heaven, hell, or other religiously\nsignificant objects. \nIn other traditions, it is not necessarily a personal being who is\nthe object of the experience, or even a positive being at all. In the\ntraditions that find their origin in the Indian\nsubcontinent—chiefly Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism—the\nobject of religious experiences is some basic fact or feature of\nreality, rather than some entity separate from the universe. In the\northodox Hindu traditions, one may certainly have an experience of a\ngod or some other supernatural entity (like Arjuna’s encounter\nwith Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita), but a great many important kinds of\nexperiences are of Brahman, and its identity with the self. In Yoga,\nwhich is based in the Samkhya understanding of the nature of things,\nthe mystical practice of yoga leads to a calming and stilling of the\nmind, which allows the yogi to apprehend directly that he or she is not\nidentical to, or even causally connected with, the physical body, and\nthis realization is what liberates him or her from suffering. \nIn Theravada Buddhism, the goal of meditation is to “see\nthings as they are,” which is to see them as unsatisfactory,\nimpermanent, and not-self (Gowans 2003, 191). The meditator, as\nhe or she makes progress along the way, sheds various delusions and\nattachments. The last one to go is the delusion that he or she is\na self. To see this is to see all of reality as made up of\nsequences of momentary events, each causally dependent on the ones that\nwent before. There are no abiding substances, and no eternal\nsouls. Seeing reality that way extinguishes the fires of craving,\nand liberates the meditator from the necessity of rebirth (Laumakis\n2008, 158–161). Seeing things as they are involves removing from\nthe mind all the delusions that stand in the way of such seeing, which\nis done by meditation practices that develop the meditator’s\nmastery of his or her own mind. The type of meditation that brings this\nmastery and allows the meditator to see the true nature of things is\ncalled Vipassana (insight) meditation. It typically involves\nsome object of meditation, which can be some feature of the meditator\nhim- or herself, some feature of the physical or mental world, or some\nabstraction, which then becomes the focus of the meditator’s\nconcentration and examination. In the end, it is hoped, the meditator\nwill see in the object the unsatisfactory and impermanent nature of\nthings and that there is no self to be found in them. At the moment of\nthat insight, nirvana is achieved. While the experience of\nnirvana is essentially the realization of a kind of insight, it is also\naccompanied by other experiential elements, especially of the cessation\nof negative mental states. Nirvana is described in the Buddhist canon\nas the extinction of the fires of desire. The Theravada tradition\nteaches other kinds of meditation that can help the meditator make\nprogress, but the final goal can’t be achieved without\nvipassana meditation. \nIn the Mahayana Buddhist traditions, this idea of the constantly\nfluctuating nature of the universe is extended in various ways.\nFor some, even those momentary events that make up the flow of the\nworld are understood to be empty of inherent existence (the idea of\ninherent existence is understood differently in different traditions)\nto the point that what one sees in the enlightenment experience is the\nultimate emptiness (sunyata) of all things. In the Yogacara\nschool of Mahayana Buddhism, this is understood as emptiness of\nexternal existence; that is, to see things as they are is to see them\nas all mind-dependent. In the Zen school of Mahayana Buddhism, the\nenlightenment experience (kensho) reveals that reality\ncontains no distinctions or dualities. Since concepts and language\nalways involve distinctions, which always involve duality, the insight\nso gained cannot be achieved conceptually or expressed linguistically.\nIn all Mahayana schools, what brings enlightenment is direct\nrealization of sunyata as a basic fact about reality. \nThe situation is somewhat more complicated in the Chinese\ntraditions. The idea of religious experience seems to be almost\ncompletely absent in the Confucian tradition; the social world looms\nlarge, and the idea of an ultimate reality that needs to be\nexperienced becomes much less prominent. Before the arrival of\nBuddhism in China, Confucianism was primarily a political and ethical\nsystem, with no particular concern with the transcendent (though\npeople who identified themselves as Confucians frequently engaged in\nChinese folk religious practices). Nevertheless, meditation (and\ntherefore something that could be called “religious\nexperience”) did come to play a role in Confucian practice in\nthe tenth century, as Confucian thought began to be influenced by\nBuddhist and Taoist thought. The resulting view is known as\nNeo-Confucianism. Neo-Confucianism retains the Mencian doctrine that\nhuman beings are by nature good, but in need of purification.  Since\ngoodness resides in every person, then examination of oneself should\nreveal the nature of goodness, through the experience of the vital\nforce within (qi). The form of meditation that arises from\nthis line of thought (“quiet sitting” or “sitting\nand forgetting”) are very like Buddhist vipassana meditation,\nbut there is no value placed on any particular insight gained, though\none can experience the principle of unity (li) behind the\nworld. Success is measured in gradual moral improvement. The Taoist\nideal is to come to an understanding of the Tao, the fundamental\nnature of reality that explains all things in the world, and live\naccording to it. Knowledge of the Tao is essential to the good life,\nbut this knowledge cannot be learned from discourses, or transmitted\nby teaching. It is only known by experiential acquaintance. The Tao\ngives the universe a kind of grain, or flow, going against which\ncauses human difficulty. The good human life is then one that respects\nthe flow of Tao, and goes along with it. This is what is meant by\n“life in accordance with nature.” By paying attention, a\nperson can learn what the Tao is, and can experience unity with\nit. This picture of reality, along with the picture of how one can\ncome to know it, heavily influenced the development of Ch’an\nBuddhism, which became Zen.","contact.mail":"mark.webb@ttu.edu","contact.domain":"ttu.edu"}]
