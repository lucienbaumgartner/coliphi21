The authors were Antoine Arnauld and Pierre\nNicole, philosophers and theologians associated with the Port-Royal\nAbbey, a center of the heretical Catholic Jansenist movement in\nseventeenth-century France. The first edition appeared in 1662; during\nthe authors' lifetimes four major revisions were published, the last\nand most important in 1683. The 1981 critical edition by Pierre Clair\nand François Girbal lists 63 French editions and 10 English editions\n(the 1818 English edition served as a text at the Universities of\nCambridge and Oxford).  The work treats topics in logic, grammar,\nphilosophy of language, theory of knowledge, and\nmetaphysics. The Logic is a companion to General and\nRational Grammar: The Port-Royal Grammar, written primarily by\nArnauld and “edited” by Claude Lancelot, which appeared in\n1660. In general the semantics of the Logic are situated in\nthe context of the Cartesian theory of ideas. Its value to us today\nresides in its combination of deep insights and confusions. \n\n\n\nThis entry will briefly discuss Arnauld's connection to the Port-Royal\nAbbey and the Jansenist movement. Then follows an overview of the\nwork, including a discussion of the Cartesian background and a summary\nof the main topics treated. The remainder of the discussion will focus\non some aspects of the theory of most interest to current logicians\nand philosophers of language, in particular, the theory of judgment,\nthe semantics of general terms, and the theory of distribution and\ntruth conditions of propositions.\n\n\n\nAntoine Arnauld, the primary author of the Port-Royal Logic,\nwas born in Paris on February 8, 1612, to Antoine and Catherine\nArnauld. His father was one of the most famous lawyers of his\ntime. The son Antoine, the youngest of their 20 children, originally\nwanted to study law, but because his father had died in 1619, he\ndecided to honor his mother's wish that he study theology. He entered\nthe Sorbonne, becoming a disciple of Lescot, the confessor of Cardinal\nRichelieu. In addition to the Port-Royal Grammar and\nthe Port-Royal Logic, Arnauld is best known as the author of\nthe Fourth Objections to Descartes' Meditations. He also\nengaged in lengthy correspondence with Leibniz, carried on a polemic\nagainst Malebranche in the Treatise on True and False Ideas,\nand wrote several theological essays, including The Perpetuity of\nthe Faith. Pierre Nicole, the secondary author, was born at\nChartres in 1625. His father was also a prominent lawyer, with ties to\nliterary circles in Paris. Nicole studied theology at the Sorbonne,\nwhere he came into contact with teachers inclined towards\nJansenism. When Jansenism came under attack at the Sorbonne, he\nwithdrew and went to the abbey at Port-Royal-des-Champs. He eventually\nbecame one of the most prominent Jansenist writers of the seventeenth\ncentury; his Moral Essays (1671–7) was his most famous\nwork. \n\nJansenism was a radical reform movement within French Catholicism\nbased on Augustine's views of the relation between free will and the\nefficacy of grace. The movement was named after Cornelis Jansen (or\nCornelius Jansenius), a Dutch theologian born in 1585 who studied at\nthe Sorbonne. He became the Bishop of Ypres in the Spanish Netherlands\nin 1636 and died two years later. His major work Augustinus\nwas published posthumously in 1640. A second figure in Jansenism was\nthe Abbot of Saint-Cyran, born Jean Duvergier de Hauranne in 1581. He\nreceived his M.A. in theology at the Sorbonne in 1600, where he met\nJansen. The two worked together from 1611–1617 on scriptural\nquestions. The issues bringing Jansenism into conflict with Catholic\northodoxy concerned the efficacy of grace, the role of free will in\nsalvation, and the nature of penitence. The attack on Jansen began\nwith Isaac Habert's sermons and writings during 1643–44. By 1653\nPope Innocent X issued an encyclical, Cum occasione,\ndeclaring five propositions in Augustinus to be\nheretical. They expressed the views that a just person who wishes to\nobey God's commandments cannot do so without the necessary grace to\ncarry them out; that in the state of corrupt nature one can never\nresist interior grace; and that meritorious actions require only a\nliberty exempt from constraint rather than one exempt from\nnecessity.  \n\nAlthough he did not agree with all of Jansen's views on grace and free\nwill, Arnauld devoted several major works to defending aspects of\nJansenism, including On Frequent Communion, the Defense\nof Monsieur Jansenius and a Second Defense. These\nwritings resulted in a trial and his expulsion from the Sorbonne in\n1656. From 1669 to the late 1670's there was a truce between the\nCatholic Church and the Jansenists. But in 1679, after attacks had\nresumed, Arnauld went into exile in the Netherlands; he died at\nBrussels on August 8, 1694. Pierre Nicole, the coauthor of\nthe Port-Royal Logic, had joined Arnauld in exile. But he\nreturned to Paris in 1683 where he reconciled with the authorities. He\ndied in Paris in 1695. \n\nThe Port-Royal Abbey was the center of Jansenist thought in the\nseventeenth century, thanks largely to the Arnauld family. Two of\nArnauld's sisters, Angélique (born Jacqueline) and Agnès (born Jeanne)\nwere nuns at the convent of Port-Royal (later known as\nPort-Royal-des-Champs), a Cistercian abbey founded in the thirteenth\ncentury near Versailles. Angélique had become the abbess of the\nconvent in 1602, at the age of thirteen.  Because of unhealthy\nconditions, in 1626 the nuns relocated to the Faubourg-Saint-Jacques\nin Paris. The following year the Vatican removed Port-Royal from the\nCistercian order and placed it under the jurisdiction of the\nArchbishop of Paris. In 1636 Saint-Cyran became the spiritual director\nof the convent, and became associated with a group of men later known\nas the solitaires of Port-Royal. They eventually included,\nbesides Arnauld, Nicole, and Lancelot, Arnauld's brother Robert and\nbrother-in-law Antoine Le Maistre. Their most important project was\nfounding the Little Schools of Port-Royal, whose most famous pupil was\nJean Racine.  By that time Saint-Cyran had come into conflict with the\nJesuits and Cardinal Richelieu over several theological issues. In\n1638 Richelieu had Saint-Cyran arrested and imprisoned at Vincennes on\ncharges of heresy. He was released from prison in 1643 but died a year\nlater.  \n\nIn April 1661 the Council of State decreed that all churchmen must\nsign a formulary drawn up in 1657, condemning the heretical\npropositions in Jansen's work Augustinus. Arnauld and Nicole\nhad taken the position that the propositions were heretical but did\nnot appear in the Augustinus. In June 1664 the Archbishop of\nParis interrogated the nuns at Port-Royal-de-Paris; he removed those\nwho refused to sign to other convents and put those remaining at\nPort-Royal under supervision of another order. In 1665 the nuns who\nhad been dispersed were permitted to go to\nPort-Royal-des-Champs. During the 1670s Port-Royal-des-Champs\nexperienced a few years of tranquility, but by 1679 Port-Royal was\nunder siege by King Louis XIV, and all confessors, postulants and\npensioners were expelled. In 1709 Louis dispersed the nuns and had the\nbuildings leveled. Despite the end of Port-Royal, Jansenism survived\nuntil the Revolution of 1789. \n\nAlthough St. Augustine shaped the theology of Jansenism, René\nDescartes was the true philosophical father of the Port-Royal\nLogic. Unlike the Jansenists, who suspected the efficacy of\nreason, Arnauld and Nicole wholeheartedly embraced Descartes'\nrationalism. In fact, their theory of knowledge is taken almost\nverbatim from Descartes. But since Cartesian rationalism is in its\nbroad outlines compatible with Augustinian views, Arnauld and Nicole\noften cite both philosophers. Furthermore, because Descartes' theory\nof knowledge is inextricably linked with his metaphysics, Arnauld and\nNicole endorse Cartesian dualism as well as the principles of\nDescartes' mechanistic physics.  \n\nDescartes' influence is evident in two basic features of the semantics\nof the Port-Royal Logic. First is the view that thought is\nprior to language, that words are merely external, conventional signs\nof independent, private mental states.  Although the association\nbetween words and ideas is conventional and thus arbitrary, language\ncan signify thought insofar as the structure of a linguistic\nexpression mirrors the structure of the ideas it expresses. The second\nfeature is the framework of the Cartesian theory of ideas. This\nincludes the traditional view that there are four mental operations\nrequired for scientific knowledge: conceiving, judging, reasoning, and\nordering. These operations must occur in this order, since each\noperation takes for its elements the product of the preceding\noperation. Conceiving consists in the apprehension of ideas by the\nunderstanding, whereas judging is an action of the will. One can\noperate on ideas without making judgments, as in forming complex ideas\nout of simpler ones, and analyzing complex ideas into their\nparts. The Logic differs from Descartes in identifying\nforming a proposition with making a judgment. Descartes himself\nsharply distinguished the voluntary act of judging from apprehending a\nproposition, since in mere apprehension the mind is passive, and\nDescartes thought an idea could take propositional form. Port-Royal\nhas difficulty with this issue in their treatment of\nassertion. Reasoning takes place when one produces judgments from\nother judgments. By ordering the authors mean putting knowledge into a\nmethodical system. \n\nThe text of the Logic is organized around the four mental\noperations described above. Introductory material to the final (1683)\nedition includes a Preface (added 1683), a Foreword and First\nDiscourse (1662), and a Second Discourse (added 1664). The First\nDiscourse lays out the plan of the Logic, explaining that its\nmain purpose is to educate judgment to make it more precise, in order\nto make the speculative sciences more useful. Thus the Logic\ncontains not only rules for correct reasoning but also examples of how\nreasoning can go wrong. The Second Discourse offers a reply to\nobjections to the first edition. The main point is to justify their\ncritical treatment of Aristotle, on the ground that knowing how a\ngreat mind can err can help others avoid making the same mistakes. But\nthey also take pains to point out how much the Logic owes to\nAristotle's Analytics and other works. The main text that\nfollows consists of parts devoted to the four mental operations. \n\nPart I contains “reflections on ideas, or the first action of\nthe mind, which is called conceiving”. It consists of 15\nchapters devoted to five topics: the nature and origin of ideas\n(chapter 1); the objects ideas represent (chapters 2–4); simple\nvs. compound ideas (chapter 5); the extension and restriction of\nideas, including a logical analysis of universal, particular, and\nsingular ideas and the extension and comprehension of terms (chapters\n6–8); and clear and distinct vs. obscure and confused ideas,\nincluding a discussion of types of definition (chapters\n9–15). \n\nPart II consists of 20 chapters treating “reflections people\nhave made about their judgments”. Recognizing that the mind\nclosely links ideas with the words that express them, their discussion\nbegins with an analysis of parts of speech in chapters 1 and 2.\nChapters 3 and 4 present a version of the Aristotelian theory of\ncategorical proposition and the square of opposition. Chapters\n5–14 treat the properties of simple, compound, and complex\npropositions, including how to identify and classify them. This\nsection contains the famous distinction between restrictive\n(“determinative”) and non-restrictive\n(“explicative”) subordinate clauses (chapter 6), as well\nas a discussion of logical connectives and non-truth-functional\npropositions (chapter 9). The theory of definition is the subject of\nchapters 15 and 16. Finally, chapters 17–20 on the conversion of\npropositions contain part of the Port-Royal version of the medieval\ndoctrine of distribution. \n\nPart III focuses on the rules of reasoning, and is divided into 20\nchapters. Although the authors admit that most erroneous reasoning is\nbased on false premises rather than incorrect inferences, they believe\nthe study of syllogistic forms is helpful to exercise the mind. The\nauthors classify syllogisms into simple and conjunctive, and simple\nsyllogisms into complex and noncomplex.  After defining terms in\nchapters 1 and 2, they present general rules for simple, noncomplex\nsyllogisms in chapter 3. This chapter completes their theory of the\ndistribution of terms, begun in the last four chapters of Part\nII. Chapters 4 through 8 explain in tedious detail the figures and\nmoods of simple syllogisms, again reproducing traditional Aristotelian\nviews. In chapters 9 through 12 the authors treat in a less formal way\nprinciples for recognizing validity in complex syllogisms. Chapters\n14, 15, and 16 discuss respectively enthymemes, sorites (syllogisms\nwith more than three propositions) and dilemmas. Despite their view of\nthe uselessness of the theory of topics (the method for finding\narguments), the authors treat it in chapters 17 and 18. Here they\ncriticize Aristotle, Ramus and the Scholastics. Finally, chapters 19\nand 20 discuss sophisms and fallacies. \n\nThe Logic ends in Part IV with a theory of scientific\nknowledge. Chapter 1 lays the groundwork in Descartes' and Augustine's\nrationalism, criticizing the role of the senses in providing\nknowledge, as well as the claims of Academic and Pyrrhonian\nskeptics. After spelling out the methods of analysis and synthesis in\nchapter 2, the authors spend chapters 3 through 10 on the methods of\ngeometry, including rules of definitions, axioms, and\ndemonstrations. Chapter 11 then offers eight rules of scientific\nmethod. Finally, chapters 12 through 16 contrast the nature of\nknowledge with faith or belief. \n\nAs mentioned above, the semantics of the Logic is an\ninteresting amalgam of medieval and seventeenth-century theories.\nArnauld and Nicole attempt to force a Cartesian view of judgment onto\nthe traditional theory of categorical propositions and a medieval term\nlogic. This attempt to graft a new theory of knowledge onto an\nexisting logical framework inevitably raises problems. This section\nwill focus on three major aspects of the theory, namely their account\nof the proposition and judgment, the semantics of general terms, and\nthe theory of distribution and truth conditions of propositions. It\nwill highlight two major contributions to semantics -- the\nanalysis of subordinate clauses and the distinction between the\ncomprehension and extension of terms -- as well as some problematic\nviews of the structure of judgment, the nature of assertion, and their\ntreatment of predication. \n\nThe Port-Royal theory of judgment (or proposition) is an example of\nwhat Geach and others have called the ‘two-name’\nview. Every simple judgment is composed of the same three elements: a\nsubject, a predicate, and a copula connecting the two. These elements\nare expressed linguistically in the simplest case by a proper or\nsubstantive noun, a common noun or adjective, and a verb, as in the\nsentences ‘Socrates is mortal’ and ‘All men are\nmortal’. The authors use the terms ‘subject’ and\n‘predicate’ to refer indifferently to the ideas making up\nthe judgment as well as to their linguistic expressions. As indicated\nabove, Port-Royal is wedded to the theory of categorical propositions,\nclassifying them in terms of quantity as universal, particular, or\nsingular, and in terms of quality as affirmative or negative. The\nauthors take the traditional stand that singular propositions function\nlogically like universals, and so all simple propositions have one of\nthe following four forms, labeled A, E, I,\nand O: ‘All S is P’,\n‘No S is P’, ‘Some S\nis P’, and ‘Some S is\nnot P’. Also following the tradition, Port-Royal treats\nthe quantifiers ‘all’ and ‘some’ as part of\nthe subject, so that ‘all men’ and ‘some men’\nare logically significant units. In explaining the rules of\nconversion, in Part II, chapter 17, they argue that predicates are\nimplicitly quantified: when one says ‘All lions are\nanimals’, one does not mean that all lions are all the\nanimals, but only some of the animals. So ‘All S\nis P’ in general means ‘All S is\n(some) P’ (Logic II.17: 130). \n\nMost propositions, however, are more complex than this classification\nsuggests, for subjects and predicates need not be simple. In the\nproposition ‘God who is invisible created the world which is\nvisible’, both the subject and predicate include subordinate\nclauses that appear to contain propositions (Logic\nII.5–8).  But because of the overall subject-predicate structure\nof all propositions, embedded propositions must be located in the\nsubject or predicate. This becomes problematic when Arnauld and Nicole\ndiscuss rules of inference, since they have to force all propositions,\nincluding conditionals and disjunctives, into standard categorical\nforms. Their treatment of the proposition, then, requires that\nsubjects and predicates have unlimited complexity.  Thus the\nPort-Royal theory provides no basic inventory of simple parts\npermitting a recursive analysis, as in the modern classification of\nvariables, function or predicate symbols, and logical symbols. On the\nclassical view the proposition has a simple organic unity from the\noutside and a reiterable complexity from the inside. \n\nWhen it comes to making judgments, the part of a proposition that\nrepresents the act of willing distinguishing a judgment from a mere\nconception is the copula, expressed linguistically by the verb.  The\ncopula has two functions in a judgment: it relates the subject and the\npredicate, and it signifies affirmation\nor denial. Arnauld and Nicole criticize Aristotle and other\nphilosophers who combine the copula with features of the predicate\n(time) and subject (person); in a well-formed language there would be\nonly one substantive verb, namely to be. In fact,\nnatural languages often combine the predicate with the verb, as in\n‘Peter lives’, and Latin verbs sometimes express all three\nelements of judgment in one word, as in cogito\nand sum. Descartes thought that in judging one holds a\ncomplex idea or proposition before the mind and then affirms or denies\nthat it corresponds to reality. But the Port-Royal treatment of the\ncopula raises serious problems for the accounts of negation and\nassertive force. \n\nNegative judgments are those expressed by sentences containing a\nnegative word or syllable attached to the verb, and are understood\nas denials, or judgments having an effect opposite\nto affirmations. Since in affirming one unites two ideas, in\ndenying one separates the subject from the predicate:  If I say God is not unjust, the\nword is when joined to the particle not signifies\nthe action contrary to affirming, namely denying, in which I view\nthese ideas as repugnant to one another, because the\nidea unjust contains something contrary to what is\ncontained in the idea God.  (Logic II.3:\n82–3)  Since the ‘not’ is attached to the verb, negation\nextends to the entire judgment. As Frege points out in his essay\n‘Negation’ (1918, for English version see Frege 1966),\nthis account makes it impossible to recognize a false thought or grasp\ntrue thoughts that have false thoughts as their components, such as\ntrue conditionals with false antecedents or consequents. For example,\nto recognize that ‘3 is greater than 5’ is false requires\nhaving a complete thought, and not merely fragments of a thought. In\naddition, this account makes it impossible to understand the force of\ndouble negation: if denying dissolves the thought into its parts, then\ndouble negation would function as a sword that magically unites the\nparts it had sundered. (Frege 1966: 122–29) The root problem in\ntreating negation as denial is the failure to distinguish the thought\nor proposition that is grasped from the act of judging it. \n\nThis same problem surfaces in the Port-Royal view that the copula has\nassertive force, which makes it impossible to distinguish making a\njudgment from merely thinking a proposition. According to\nthe Logic, every time one connects a subject and a predicate\none is ipso facto judging. Thus there is no room for thinking\npropositions while suspending judgment, as Descartes advocates in his\nmethod of doubt. This view of the copula also creates a problem for\nembedded generality. Because of the ‘two-name’ view,\nPort-Royal must locate subordinate clauses in either the subject or\nthe predicate. But some embedded clauses make assertions and some do\nnot. Despite the two verbs in the complex proposition ‘Men who\nare pious are charitable’, for example, it is clear that one is\nnot asserting of all men or even some men that they are pious. On the\nother hand, ‘God who is invisible created the world which is\nvisible’ permits three assertions: ‘God is\ninvisible’, ‘The world is visible’, and ‘God\ncreated the world’ (II.5: 87). Port-Royal explains the\ndifference between these two kinds of embedding in terms of\n‘determinative’ and ‘explicative’ subordinate\nclauses (or, as they say, relative pronouns) (see\nII.6–8). Determinative subordinate clauses restrict the\nsignification of the antecedent of the relative pronoun (e.g.,\n‘men who are pious’) whereas explicative clauses do not\n(e.g., ‘God who is invisible’). In fact both\ndeterminations and explications can be carried out as well without\nembedded or subordinate clauses, as in the sentences ‘Pious men\nare charitable’ and ‘The invisible God created the visible\nworld’. So this view of the copula again fails to distinguish\ncomplex ideas containing assertions from those that do not, showing\nhow far Port-Royal was from a satisfactory treatment of assertion and\nembedded generality (see Buroker 1994). \n\nIn a recent article Van der Schaar amends the account given above,\npointing out that although Port-Royal generally assumes the\nproposition has assertive force, the authors recognize deviant\ncontexts in which this is not true. She draws attention to their\ntreatment of modality (Logic II.8) where modal terms such as\n‘possible’ and ‘necessary’ function to modify\nthe act of judging rather than the content of the proposition (see Van\nder Scharr 2008: 334–5). The authors label such acts\n‘tacit’ or ‘virtual’ affirmations (II.7:\n93). She concludes that although for Port-Royal the notion of asserted\nproposition is prior in the order of explanation, the authors in fact\nanalyze some complex propositions as lacking assertive force. \n\nThe Port-Royal semantics is based on a theory of the relations between\nwords, ideas, and things. Like Descartes, Arnauld and Nicole hold that\nthe representative relation between ideas and things is\nboth objective and natural. They specify that when\nthey speak of ideas, they mean “anything in the mind\nwhen we can truthfully say that we are conceiving something, however we\nconceive it” (Logic I.1: 26). Thus the idea viewed as\nthe element of logic and knowledge is the objective content\nof thought. And since ideas represent things, the structure of ideas\nis isomorphic to the structure of the real: one cannot change the\ncontent of the idea of a right triangle. By contrast, the relation\nbetween words and ideas is not natural, for words are conventional\nsigns of thoughts (I.4: 37). Humans assign words their meaning through\nacts of institution. So the expressive relation between words and\nideas differs in important ways from the representative relation\nbetween ideas and things. First, the relation between the linguistic\nsign and its idea is causal-psychological. That is, words, like\nnatural signs, signify by prompting an idea in the perceiver's\nmind. In practice, however, Port-Royal tends to assimilate words to\nideas, calling both ‘terms’, and treats significance as\ntransitive, claiming the words used to express ideas also signify the\nthings signified by ideas. There is a second difference between\nlinguistic and eidetic significance, namely that the correspondence\nbetween words and ideas is imperfect. Port-Royal assumes that if\nlanguage coincided exactly with thought, each word would express one\nsimple idea, and the structure of the sentence would mirror the\nstructure of ideas. But humans use single words like\n‘triangle’ to express complex ideas, and are sometimes\nconfused as to which ideas are connected with which words.\nConsequently there is no guarantee that the structure of linguistic\ndiscourse accurately reflects the structure of ideas. As this overview\nsuggests, the semantic theory in Port-Royal is carried out on two\nlevels, first with respect to ideas, and second with respect to\nlanguage.  \n\nPort-Royal first classifies ideas with respect to their\nobjects. According to Cartesian metaphysics, there are three sorts of\nthings: substances, attributes or primary essential properties of\nsubstances, and modes or accidental properties.  Port-Royal condenses\nthis framework into the simpler distinction between things or\nsubstances and manners of things. A thing is “conceived as\nsubsisting by itself and as the subject of everything conceived\nabout it”; examples of nouns signifying things are\n‘earth’, ‘sun’, ‘mind’, and\n‘God’. A manner is “conceived as in the thing and not\nable to subsist without it, determines it to be in a certain way\nand causes it to be so named”.  Manners are expressed by\nabstract nouns such as ‘hardness’ and\n‘justice’, as well as by adjectives such as\n‘hard’ and ‘just’ (I.2: 30–31). As will\nbecome apparent below, adjectives have a more complex form of\nsignification than nouns. But at this first level the theory depends\non a distinction between things, that is, complete or independent\nentities, and manners of things, incomplete or dependent entities. The\ntable below gives a general sketch of the theory so far: Simple Port-Royal \n\nThis treatment in some ways resembles a modern analysis of\npredication: ideas of substances would function as subjects of\njudgment; ideas of attributes or manners would be predicates. The\nanalysis also looks Fregean given the emphasis on the distinction\nbetween complete and incomplete objects of thought. Thus Cartesian\nmetaphysics has the resources to analyze an atomic proposition as\ncomposed of an expression for an attribute and a name of an\nobject. But because of the subject-predicate analysis of all judgment\nand their semantics of general terms, the final theory is more\ncomplex. What results is a systematic confusion between names and\npredicates. (This discussion is based on Buroker 1993.) \n\nThe first complication occurs in Chapter 6 of Part I, where the\nauthors distinguish singular from general or universal ideas.\nAlthough everything that exists is singular, ideas can represent more\nthan one thing, such as the general idea of a triangle. They then\ndistinguish proper nouns which indicate single individuals, such as\n‘Socrates’, ‘Rome’, ‘Bucephalus’,\nfrom common or appellative nouns such as ‘man’,\n‘city’, ‘horse’, which can indicate more than\none thing. Throughout the text, the authors call both universal ideas\nand common nouns ‘general terms’. The question that arises\nis the relation between these two ways of classifying ideas, the first\nin terms of complete or incomplete objects, the second into singular\nor general ideas. It is tempting to identify the two, but this is not\neasy for Port-Royal. The best way to appreciate the complexity in the\ntheory is to use Frege's simpler theory as a point of reference. \n\nFor Frege, meaning takes place in a three-fold structure, comprised of\nlinguistic expressions, the entities they designate or refer to, and\nthe sense of the expression, which is a mode of presenting the entity.\nIn ‘The Thought’ (1918, for English version see Frege\n1966) Frege carefully distinguishes the subjective nature of ideas\nconsidered as mental states from the objective nature of thoughts\nexpressed in judgments (Frege 1966: 302). Despite the difference in\nterminology, Fregean senses function very much like ideas in\nPort-Royal: they are the objective contents of thoughts and\nutterances. Frege maintains that connected to every linguistic sign\nthere is a reference and a sense. The sense is the mode of\npresentation of that to which the sign refers. Frege divides\nlinguistic signs into three groups: proper names (singular terms),\nfunction expressions (including concept-expressions), and\nsentences. Proper names and sentences are complete names;\nfunction-expressions are incomplete names. In ‘On Sense and\nReference’ Frege specifies that proper names such as\n‘Socrates’ and ‘the teacher of Plato’ express\nindividual or complete senses, which refer to individual complete\nentities. Declarative sentences also express senses—the thought\ncontained in the sentence—and designate or refer to complete\nobjects, namely the truth value of the sentence. In ‘Comments on\nSense and Meaning’ Frege makes clear that the reference of a\nfunction-expression is a function, an incomplete\nentity. Function-expressions contain one or more gaps corresponding to\nthe ‘unsaturated’ or incomplete nature of the sense they\nexpress and the entities they designate.  For example, the expression\n‘is a man’ names a concept under which all humans\nfall. Here is a sketch of Frege's theory: Frege \n\nSo far there is an overlap between this view and Port-Royal's theory\nof ideas. For Arnauld and Nicole meaning has a three-fold structure,\nwith ideas taking the place of Fregean senses.  Linguistic signs\nexpress ideas, which represent or refer to entities, either things or\ntheir attributes. Names of entities are either proper or common,\ndepending on whether they express singular or general ideas. If the\ndistinction between ideas of things and ideas of attributes coincided\nwith the distinction between singular and general ideas, the parallel\nwith Frege would be complete. But Port-Royal actually says that\ngeneral ideas represent or refer to more than one individual. On this\nview the reference of a general term is not an attribute, but the\ncollection of individuals possessing the attribute. This is one way\nPort-Royal assimilates the relation of a name to its bearer with the\nrelation of a predicate or concept-expression to the objects falling\nunder it. Had the authors stopped here, the picture would be fairly\nsimple. But they develop the theory in two ways. First, they\ncontribute to the history of semantics by distinguishing the\ncomprehension (or intension) of a general term from its extension\n(denotation). And second, they are led astray by grammatical\nconsiderations into blurring their own distinction between expressions\nfor complete and incomplete entities. \n\nMedieval philosophers explained the significance of general terms by a\ncomplex theory of supposition (see Spade 1982). Port-Royal condenses\nthis framework so that the significance of general ideas has two\naspects: the comprehension and the extension. The\ncomprehension consists in the set of attributes essential to the\nidea. For example, the comprehension of the idea\n‘triangle’ includes the attributes extension, shape, three\nlines, and three angles. The extension of the idea consists in the\ninferiors or subjects to which the term applies, which for Port-Royal\nincludes “all the different species of triangles” (I.6:\n39–40). Here the authors confuse the species with the\nindividual, or the relation of set inclusion with set\nmembership. Usually, however, they take the extension of a general\nidea to be the individuals possessing the attributes in its\ncomprehension. There are three key features of this theory of\nsignification. First, the comprehension rather than the extension is\nessential to the function of a general idea: one cannot remove an\nattribute without destroying the idea, whereas one can restrict its\nextension by applying it to only some of the subjects that fall under\nit. Second, the comprehension governs the extension: the set of\nattributes determines the individuals (and species) in its\nextension. Finally, comprehensions and extensions are inversely\nrelated. In adding attributes to the comprehension of an idea one\nrestricts its extension (assuming attributes are independent and\ninstantiated). For example, if the comprehension of the idea\n‘mammal’ includes that of the idea ‘animal’,\nthe extension of ‘animal’ includes that of\n‘mammal’. Port-Royal implicitly assumes this principle\nthroughout the text. In recognizing these two modes of\nsignification—the comprehension and the\nextension—Port-Royal imports the distinction between incomplete\nand complete entities into the signification of general terms.  \n\nCompleting the theory of signification of terms is the noun system,\ntaken largely from Part II of the Grammar. As explained in\nPart II of the Logic, nouns are names of entities, that is,\nsubstances and attributes. Substantive nouns such as\n‘earth’ and ‘sun’ signify substances, and\nadjectival nouns such as ‘good’ and ‘just’\nsignify attributes, “indicating at the same time the subject to\nwhich they apply…”. Just as substances are ontologically\nprior to their manners or modes, nouns preceded adjectives in the\ngenesis of language. From the adjective one then creates a secondary\nsubstantive, an abstract noun:  after having formed the adjective human from the substantive\nword man, we form the\nsubstantive humanity from the\nadjective human. (Logic II.1: 74)  Thus there are three kinds of nouns: concrete substantives,\nadjectives, and abstract substantives. The Logic says that\nadjectives have two significations: a distinct signification of the\nmode or manner, and a confused signification of the subject. Although\nthe signification of the mode is more distinct, it is indirect; by\ncontrast the confused signification of the subject is direct (II.1:\n74–75). So on their account every noun picks out\nor distinctly signifies one thing, either an individual, a\ncollection of individuals, or an attribute.  Concrete substantives\ndistinctly signify complete objects, that is, individual substances:\n‘man’ distinctly signifies human beings. The adjective\n‘human’ distinctly signifies the incomplete object, the\nattribute of being human.  And abstract substantives such as\n‘humanity’ also pick out this attribute distinctly. But\nthe adjective ‘human’, unlike the concrete substantive\n‘man’, is linguistically incomplete, since it means\n‘a human [being]’.  Linguistically adjectives are gappy\nand require completion by a substantive to refer. Port-Royal\nidentifies this incomplete signification as the connotation\nor confused (but direct) signification of an adjective. So adjectives\nsignify substances directly and confusedly, and\nattributes indirectly and distinctly. Because substantive\nnouns of both kinds are linguistically complete, they lack connotation\naltogether, and have only distinct and direct signification to the\nindividual substances or attributes they name. The following chart\nrepresents these signification relations: \n\nIt looks as though Port-Royal is led to this notion of the double\nsignification of adjectives only because they transfer metaphysical\ncategories to language. Originally, concrete nouns were words naming\nsubstances or complete entities, and adjectives were names of\nattributes or incomplete entities. But Arnauld and Nicole blur this\ndistinction by taking signification to depend on whether\nthe word is capable of referring alone in discourse.\nIncorporating this last analysis into the overall semantics yields\nthis final result: Revised Port-Royal \n\nIn spite of the complexity a few observations are possible.  First,\nboth concrete nouns and adjectives directly signify the objects in the\nextension of the term. This makes it look as if Arnauld and Nicole are\nequating ‘direct signification’ with ‘being\npredicable of’ (or denotation), except that this does not apply\nin the case of the abstract noun. On the other hand, the distinct but\nindirect signification of the adjective looks equivalent to Frege's\nview of the reference of concept-expressions, except that Frege treats\nthe distinction between complete and incomplete reference as invariant\nacross grammatical form. On his view both common nouns and adjectives\nare incomplete expressions. Their predicative nature is more easily\nseen when they are correctly formulated, as in ‘is a man’\nand ‘is human’. \n\nIt is not so clear whether Port Royal wants to apply the distinction\nbetween the comprehension and extension of an idea to singular\nterms. In fact, they treat singular terms, including definite\ndescriptions, as afterthoughts. One passage does, however, address the\nnature of definite descriptions. In chapter 8 of Part I the authors\nelaborate on the “error of equivocation” that can occur\nwhen people interpret a complex singular term differently. For\nexample, adherents to different faiths can disagree over the referent\nof the complex singular term ‘the true\nreligion’. Stoianovici argues that in their explanation Arnauld\nand Nicole come close to recognizing Donnellan's distinction between\nattributive and referential uses of definite descriptions. According\nto the account of general terms, adjectives or ‘connotative\nterms’ signify substances (the extension) confusedly and\ndirectly, but attributes (the comprehension) distinctly but\nindirectly. The authors treat definite descriptions such as ‘the\ntrue religion’ as connotative (general) terms rather than\nsingular terms, claiming they refer confusedly to a distinct\nindividual. The error occurs when different thinkers substitute\ndifferent individuals for this reference. As Stoianovici notes, their\nanalysis explicitly recognizes only the referential use, although it\nimplies the possibility of the attributive use of definite\ndescriptions.  \n\nVery little has been written on the Port Royal views of truth\nconditions of propositions, and the rules of valid syllogisms,\nincluding their account of the distribution of terms. Recently Parsons\naddresses their views in his article on the history of the theory of\ndistribution. Parsons' main concern is to respond to criticisms of the\ndoctrine of distribution raised by Geach, who maintains both that the\ndoctrine originated in the medieval theory of the ‘distributed\nsupposition’ (reference) of terms and that it is\nincoherent. Parsons argues to the contrary that it appeared much\nearlier, in connection with the test for validity of syllogisms in the\ntheory of inference. Although Aristotle did not have a term for\ndistribution, he did express the concept of a term's being taken\nuniversally in On Interpretation. In his defense of the\ndoctrine, Parsons argues that the Port Royal theory of truth\nconditions of propositions, although incomplete and idiosyncratic, can\nbe extended to provide a coherent account of distribution. This\nsection will briefly treat the Port Royal theory of distribution and\nsome aspects of the related account of truth conditions of\njudgments. \n\nAs explained in 3.1 above, the Logic classifies simple\ncategorical propositions into four forms: universal affirmatives\n(All S is P), universal negatives (No S\nis P), particular affirmatives (Some S is P) and\nparticular negatives (Some S is not P). Simple\ncategorical syllogisms are arguments with two premises and a\nconclusion, each statement taking one of these four forms. Port Royal\ngives this example of a categorical syllogism: \n\nIn this syllogism the term “good prince” is the middle\nterm, because it appears in both premises but not in the\nconclusion. In chapter 3 of Part III, Port Royal gives six rules or\n“axioms” for valid simple categorical syllogisms, rules\nconforming to standard medieval logic. The first two concern the\ndistribution of terms, where a distributed term is expressed as one\n‘taken universally’: \n\nThe remaining four rules express the standard views that at least one\npremise must be affirmative, the conclusion must be affirmative if\nboth premises are affirmative, if one premise is negative the\nconclusion must be negative, and nothing follows from two particular\npremises (III.3: 141–42). \n\nIn general, a term is distributed if it is ‘taken\nuniversally’ or refers to all the individuals it denotes;\notherwise it is undistributed. As Parsons explains, the denotation of\na term is its extension on its own, whereas its reference is its\nextension in a proposition (Parsons 2006: 61). Thus the term\n‘prince’ denotes (i.e., is predicable of) all princes, but\nin the proposition ‘Some princes are just’, the quantifier\n‘Some’ restricts its extension in the proposition (its\nreference) to a subset of its extension on its own (denotation).\nAccording to the rules for distribution stated by medieval logicians,\nthe subject terms of universal propositions and the predicates of\nnegative propositions are distributed or taken universally throughout\ntheir extension; all other terms are undistributed. Port Royal accepts\nthese rules in chapters 17–20 of Part II, in explaining the\nconversion of propositions, accounting for them in terms of the truth\nconditions of propositions. The First Axiom of affirmative\npropositions states that the subjects of universal affirmatives are\ndistributed (taken universally) and the subjects of particular\naffirmatives are not (II.17: 130). According to the Fourth Axiom of\naffirmative propositions, \nThe extension of the attribute is restricted by that of the\nsubject, such that it signifies no more than the part of its extension\nwhich applies to the subject. For example, when we say that\nhumans are animals, the word ‘animal’ no longer signifies\nall animals, but only those animals that are humans. (Logic\nII.17: 130–31)   The rules for conversion of affirmative\npropositions follow from these truth conditions, namely that universal\naffirmatives can be converted “by adding a mark of particularity\nto the attribute which becomes the subject”, and particular\naffirmatives can be simply converted (II.18: 132). Chapters 19 and 20\nof Part II similarly treat the truth conditions of negative\npropositions and their respective rules of conversion. The nature of a\nnegative proposition “is to conceive that one thing is not\nanother”, that is, the subject is not the attribute. Thus the\nSixth Axiom states that “The attribute of a negative\nproposition is always taken generally” or is\ndistributed. Parsons notes that as stated the theory of truth\nconditions is in fact incomplete because the authors do not explicitly\ndiscuss the extensions in the proposition of the subject terms of\nparticular negatives, but one can presume that the rules for\nextensions of subject terms in affirmative propositions apply (Parsons\n2006: 70). When completed to preserve the logical relations in\nAristotle's square of opposition (which Port Royal clearly intends),\nthe theory fits both with the traditional doctrine of distribution and\nmore modern views of the truth conditions of categorical\npropositions. Thus Parsons takes the Port Royal account of truth\nconditions to give a coherent basis for the traditional theory of\ndistribution. \n\nMore recently Martin offers a more detailed interpretation of the\nPort-Royal theory of truth-conditions for categorical\npropositions. Like Parsons, he discusses the relation between the\ntruth-conditions of propositions and the theory of distribution.\nMartin disagrees with Parsons' view that the doctrine of distribution\ndeveloped independently of the medieval theory of distributive\nsupposition. According to his analysis, the Port Royal theory of\ntruth-conditions depends on the idea of a universal (distributive)\nterm, as well as the notion of a conservative quantifier and the\ndistinction between affirmative and negative propositions (see Martin\n2013).  \n\nAs is clear, the Port-Royal Logic is full of confusions as\nwell as insights. This discussion has emphasized their confusions\nbetween complex idea and proposition, proposition and judgment, and\nespecially name and predicate. Other topics that deserve more\nattention include singular terms and definite descriptions, logical\noperators and quantifiers, the theory of truth conditions, and the\ntheory of inference. It may be more profitable to regard the work as\nincorporating several logics, and to view the confusions as the\ninevitable results of the tensions among these different views."}]
