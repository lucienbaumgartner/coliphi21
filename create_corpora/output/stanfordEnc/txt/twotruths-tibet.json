The Indian Buddhist schools are named after the theories\nof the two truths they each upheld as in the entry on the\n theory of the two truths in India.\n The same cannot be said about the schools of thought in Tibet. All\nTibetan philosophers and the\n schools[1]—Nyingma,\n Kagyü, Sakya, and Gelug—they established are\nself-confessed followers of the Prāsaṅgika Madhyamaka\nschool of thought, and follow Candrakīrti closely. Tibetans agree\nthat Candrakīrti is the undisputed authority in commenting and\ninterpreting Nāgārjuna's Madhyamaka theory of the two\ntruths. The Tibetan Prāsaṅgikas however disagreed, debated\nand fought fiercely amongst themselves concerning many philosophical\nquestions. Who is the Prāsaṅgika? Does the\nPrāsaṅgika hold any position? What is it that constitutes\nthe Prāsaṅgika's core philosophical position? How should\nCandrakīrti's hermeneutic approach towards Nāgārjuna be\nassessed, evaluated and interpreted? The debate amongst the Tibetan\nphilosophers stems on a large part from the way in which they each\ndifferently interpreted and understood Candrakīrti's theory of\nthe two truths and its philosophical implications. The parameters\nwithin which this debate is conducted either in the monastic debate\ncourtyards or in their philosophical writings, took a form around\ncertain philosophical themes. Those themes later became the standard\nparadigmatic focus of any discussion on the subject of the two\ntruths.\n\nBasis of the division: What is divided into the two truths?\n\nEtymological analysis (sgra bshad) of the two truths\n\nDefinition (mtshan nyid / nges tshig) of the two truths:\nSubjective or objective?\n\nEnumeration (grangs nges): Is there one or two truths?\n\nClassification (rab dbye): Are there many types of conventional\ntruth or one?\n\nRelation: Are the two truths distinct or identical?\n\nKeeping with the Tibetan Madhyamaka traditions, the present essay on\nthe theory of the two truths in Tibet focuses on the philosophical\nissues arising from and associated with these themes. Therefore our\nconcern in this article is not historical evolution of the schools, or\nthe philosophers and the ideas to which they each are associated, our\nconcern is rather, first and foremost philosophical.\n\nLongchen Rabjam sets out the course of the Nyingma theory of the\ntruths and the later philosophers of the school took similar stance\nwithout varying much in essence. In Treasure he begins the\nsection on the Madhyamaka theory of the two truths as follows:\n“The Madhyamaka tradition is the secret and profound teachings\nof the [Śākya]mūni. Although it constitues five\nontological categories, the two truths subsume them.” (Longchen,\n1983: 204f) \nNyingma defines conventional truth as consisting of unreal phenomena\nthat appear to be real to the erroneous cognitive processes of the\nordinary beings while ultimate truth is reality which transcends any\nmode of thinking and speech, one that unmistakenly appears to the\nnonerroneous cognitive processes of the exalted and awakened beings.\nIn other words (1) ultimate truth represents the perspective of\nepistemically correct and warranted cognitive process of exalted\nbeings (‘phags pa); whereas (2) conventional truth represents\nthe perspective of epistemically deceptive and unwarranted cognitive\nprocesses of the ordinary beings. (Mipham Rinpoche 1993d:\n543–544) \nLet us consider these two definitions turn by turn. Nyingma supports\ndefinition (1) with two premises. The first one says that cognitive\nprocesses of the exalted (‘phags pa) and awakened beings (sang\nrgyas) are epistemically correct and non-deceptive, because “It\nis in relation to this cognitive content that the realisation of the\nultimate truth is so designated. The object of an exalted cognitive\nprocess consists of the way things really are (gshis kyi gnas lugs),\nphenomena as they really are (chos kyi dbyings) which is undefiled by\nits very nature (rang bzin dag pa).” (Longchen 1983: 202f)\nHowever ultimate truth for Nyingma is not an object per se in the\nusual sense of the word. It is object only in the metaphorical sense.\n“From the [ultimate] perspective the meditative equipoise of the\nrealised (sa thob) and awakened beings (sangs rgyas), there exists\nneither object of knowledge (shes bya) nor knowing cognitive process\n(shes byed) and so forth, for there is neither object to apprehend nor\nthe subject that does the apprehending. Even the exalted cognitive\nprocess (yeshes) as a subject ceases (zhi ba) to operate.”\n(Longchen 1983: 201f) Therefore “At this stage, [Nyingma]\naccepts the total termination (chad) of all the continua\n(rgyun) of the cognitive processes (‘jug pa) of the mind (sems)\nand mental factors (sems las byung ba). This exalted cognitive process\nwhich is inexpressible beyond words and thoughts (smra bsam brjod du\nmed pa'i yeshes), and thus is designated (btags pa) as a\ncorrect and unmistaken cognitive process (yang dag\npa'i blo ma khrul ba) as it knows the reality as it is.”\n(Longchen 1983:201f) \nThe second premise comes from Nyingma's transcendent theory. According\nto this theory ultimate truth constitutes reality and the reality\nconstitutes transcendence of all elaborations. Reality is that which\ncannot be comprehended by the means of linguistic and conceptual\nelaboration, as it is utterly beyond the grasp of words and thoughts\nwhich merely defile the cognitive states. Given that exalted beings\nare free of defiled mental states, all forms of thoughts and\nconceptions are terminated in their realization of the ultimate truth.\nUltimate truth transcends all elaborations, thus remains untouched by\nthe philosophical speculations. (Longchen, 1983: 203f) “In short\nthe characteristic of [ultimate truth] is that of nirvāṇa,\nwhich is profound and peaceful. It is intrinsically unadulterated\ndomain (dbyings). The cognitive process by means of which ultimate\ntruth is realized must therefore be free from all cognitive\nlimitations (sgribs pa), for it is disclosed to the awakened beings\n(sangs rgyas) in whose exalted cognitive processes appear the objects\nas they really are without being altered.” (Longchen, 1983:\n204f) \nNyingma's defence of the definition (2) also has two premises. The\nfirst one comes from its theory of error, the most commonly used by\nthe Nyingma philosophers. According to this theory, conventional truth\nis, as matter of fact, an error confined to the ordinary beings (so so\nskye bo) who are blinded by the dispositions (bag chags) of confusion\n(ma rig pa). It is argued that under the sway of confusion the\nordinary beings falsely and erroneously believe in the reality of\nentirely unreal entities and the truth of wholly false epistemic\ninstruments, just like the people who mistakenly grasps cataracts and\nfalling hairs to be real objects. Conventional truths are mere errors\nthat appear real to the ordinary beings, but they are in fact no more\nreal than the falling hairs that are reducible into the “modes\nof apprehensions” (snang tshul). (Mipham Rinpoche\n1993c: 3, 1977: 80–81ff, 1993d: 543–544) \nThe second premise comes from its representationalist or\nelaboration-theory which says that conventional truths constitute\nmerely mental elaborations (spros pa) represented to appear (rnam par\nsnang ba) in the minds of the ordinary beings as if they are realities\nhaving the subject-object relation. They are thus deceptive since they\nare produced through the power of the underlying cognitive confusion\nor ignorance, and that they do not cohere with any corresponding\nreality externally. Confusion is saṃvṛti because\nit conceals (sgrib) the nature, it fabricates all conditioned\nphenomena to appear as if they are real. Even though conventional\ntruths are to be eventually eradicated (spang bya), the\nrepresentational images of the conventional reality will nevertheless\ncontinue to appear in the minds of even those who are highly realized\nbeings, that is, until they achieved a complete cessation of mind and\nmental states. (Longchen, 1983: 203f) It is argued that when the eye\nthat is affected by cataracts mistakenly sees hairs falling in\ncontainers, the healthy eye that is not affected by cataracts does not\neven perceive the appearances of falling hairs. Likewise, those who\nare affected by the cataracts of afflictive confusion see things as\nintrinsically real, hence for them things are conventionally real.\nThose noble beings who are free from the afflictive confusion and the\nawakened beings who are free from even the non-afflictive confusion\nsee things as they are (ultimate truth). Just as the person without\ncataracts does not see the falling hairs, the noble beings and\nawakened beings do not see any reality of things at all. \nMipham Rinpoche also proposes another definition of the two truths\nwhich diverges significantly from the one we saw. As we saw Longchen's\ndefinition is based on two radically opposed epistemic criteria\nwhereas Mipham's definition, as we shall see, has two radically\nopposed ontological criteria—one that withstands reasoned\nanalysis and the other that does not withstand reasoned analysis. In\nhis Clearing Dhamchoe's Doubts (Dam chos dogs sel),\nMipham says that: “Reality as it is (de bzhin nyid) is\nestablished as ultimately real (bden par grub pa). Conventional\nentities are actually established as unreal, they are subject to\ndeception. Being devoid of such characteristics ultimate is\ncharacterized as real, not unreal and not non-deceptive. If this\n[reality] does not exist,” in Mipham's view, “than it\nwould be impossible even for the noble beings (ārya / phags pa)\nto perceive reality. They would, instead, perceive objects that are\nunreal and deceptive. If that is the case, everyone would be ordinary\nbeings. There would be no one who will attain liberation.”\n(1993a: 602) \nMipham anticipates objections to his definition from his Gelug\nopponents when he writes, “Someone may object: although ultimate\ntruth is real (bden p), its reality is not established ultimately\n(bden grub), because to be established ultimately is for it to\nwithstands reasoned analysis (rigs pas dpyad bzod).” (Mipham\n1993a: 603) The response from Mipham makes it even clearer.\n“Conventional truth is not ultimately real (bden par grub pa)\nbecause it is not able to withstand reasoned analysis, in spite of the\nfact that those that are conventionally real (yang dag kun rdzob) are\nnominally real (tha snyad du bden pa) and are the objects of the\ndualistic cognitive processes.” (Mipham 1993a: 603) In contrast:\n“Reality (dharmatā / chos nyid), ultimate truth,\nis really established (bden par grub pa) on the ground that it is\nestablished as the object of nondual exalted cognitive\nprocess. Besides, it withstands reasoned analysis, for no\nlogical reasoning whatsoever can undermine it or destroy it.\nFor that reason so long as it does not withstand reasoned analysis, it\nis not ultimate, it would be conventional entity.” (Mipham\n1993a: 603) According to Mipham's argument, that an object that cannot\nwithstand reasoned analysis is the kind of object that mundane\ncognitive processes find dually, and it is not the kind of object\nfound by the exalted cognitive processes that perceive ultimate truth\nnondually. (Mipham 1993a: 603) \nAs we have noticed, Mipham's definition seems to have departed from\nLongchen's some what significantly. In the final analysis, however,\nthere does not seem to be much variation. Mipham Rinpoche also is\ncommitted to the representationalist argument to ascend to nonduality:\n“In the end,” he says, “there are no external\nobjects. It is evident that they appear due to the force of mental\nimpressions … All texts that supposedly demonstrate the\nexistence of external objects are provisional [descriptions of] their\nappearances.”(Mipham 1977: 159–60ff) Consequently whatever\nappears to exist externally, according to Nyingma, “is like a\nhorse or an elephant appearing in a dream. When it is subjected to\nlogical analysis, it finally boils down to the interdependent inner\npredispositions. And this is at the heart of Buddhist\nphilosophy.” (Mipham 1977: 159–60ff ) \nFollowing on from its definition, Nyingma argues that there is no one\nentity that can be taken as the basis from which divides the two\ntruths; since there is no one entity which is both real (true) and\nunreal (false). Hence it proposes the two truths division based on the\ntwo types of epistemic practices “because it confirms a direct\nopposition between that which is free of the elaborations and that\nwhich is not free of the elaborations, and between what is to be\naffirmed and what is to be negated excluding the possibility of the\nthird alternative. Thus it ascertains the two.” (Longchen, 1983:\n205–206ff) Nyingma has two key arguments to support the claim\nthe two truths division is an epistemic. The first argument states,\n“It is definite that we posit the objects (yul rnams) in\ndependence upon the subjects (yul can). The subjects are exclusively\ntwo types—they are either ultimately (mthar thug pa) fallacious\ncognitive processes (khrul ba'i blo) or ultimately (mthar thug pa)\nnon-fallacious cognitive processes (ma ‘khrula ba'i blo). The\nfallacious cognitive processes posit [conventional truth]—all\nsaṃsāric phenomena—whereas as the non-fallacious\ncognitive processes posit the [ultimate] reality. Therefore it is due\nto the cognitive processes that we posit the objects in terms of two\n[truths]” (Longchen, 1983: 206f) The second argument states that\nultimate truth is not an objective domain of the cognitive processes\nwith the representational images (dmigs bcas kyi blo'i spyod yul), for\nthe reason that it may be known by means of the exalted cognitive\nprocesses (yeshes) with no representational image (dmigs pa med).\n(Longchen, 1983: 206f) In contrast conventional truth is an objective\ndomain of the cognitive processes with the representational images\n(dmigs bcas kyi blo'i spyod yul), for the reason that it may be known\nby means of the cognitive processes having the representational images\n(dmigs bcas kyi blo'i spyod ul). \nNyingma categorically rejects commitment to any philosophical\nposition, for it would entail a commitment to, at least, some forms of\nelaborations. This is so since “the Prāsaṅgika\nrejects all philosophical systems, and does not accept any self-styled\nphilosophical elaboration (rang las spros pas grub mtha’).\n(Longchen, 1983: 210ff) The Prāsaṅgika therefore presents\nthe theory of the two truths and so forth by merely designating them\nin accordance with the mundane fabrications (sgro btags). (Longchen\n1983: 211f) “Therefore ultimate truth which is transcendent of\nall elaborations cannot be expressed either as identical to or\nseparate from the conventional truth. They are rather merely\ndifferent in terms of negating the oneness. (Longchen,\n1983: 192–3ff, Mipham 1977: 84f) Interestingly Mipham\nRinpoche also says that “the two truths constitute a single\nentity but different conceptual identities (ngo bo gcig la ldog pa\ntha dad). “This is because,” he says,\n“appearance and emptiness are indistinguishable. This is\nascertained through reliable cognitions (tshad ma) by means of which\nthe two truths are investigated. What appears is empty. If emptiness\nwere to exist separately from what appears, the reality of that\n[apparent] phenomenon would not be empty. Thus the two [truths] are\nnot distinct.” (Mipham 1977: 81f) The identity of ultimate truth\nat issue here, according to Mipham, is that of absolute ultimate (rnam\ngrangs min pa'i don dam ste), rather than provisional ultimate. This\nis because the kind of ultimate truth under discussion when we are\ndiscussing its relation with conventional truth is the ultimate truth\n“which is beyond the bound of any expression, although it is an\nobject of direct perception.” (Mipham 1977: 81f) \nAccording to Karmapa Mikyö Dorje, Ātisha and his followers\nin Tibet, are the authoritative former masters of the\nPrāsaṅgika. It is this line of reading of the\nPrāsaṅgika that Kagyü takes it to be authoritative\nwhich the later Kagyü wholeheartedly embraces as the standard\nposition. (Mikyö Dorje, 2006: 272–273) Karmapa Mikyö\nDorje cliams that it is a characteristic of Kagyü masters and\ntheir followers to recognise the ancient Prāsaṅgika\ntradition to be philosophically impeccable (‘khrul med). (2006:\n272) \nUnlike the other Tibetan schools, Kagyü rejects the more dominant\nview that each philosophical school in Indian Buddhism has its own\ndistinctive theory of the two truths. “There are those who\nadvance various theories proclaiming that the Vaibhāṣika on\nup to the Prāsaṅgika Madhyamaka, for the purpose of\ndistinctive definitions of the two truths, unique rational and unique\ntextual bases. This is indeed,” says Karmapa Mikyö Dorje,\nan indication “of the failure to understand the logic, and the\ndifferentiation between the definition (mtshan nyid) and the defined\nexample (mtshan gzhi).” (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 293) The Indian\nBuddhist philosophical schools only disagree, according to Kagyü,\non the issue concerning the defined example (mtshan gzhi) of the two\ntruths. The instances of ultimate truth in each lower school are, it\nargues, their philosophical reifications, hence, they are the ones the\nhigher schools logically refute. There is evertheless no disagreement\nbetween the Indian Buddhist schools as far as the definiendum (mtshon\nbya / lakṣya) and the definition (mtshan nyid /\nlakṣaṇa) of the two truths are concerned. If they disagree\non these two issues, there would be no commonly agreed definition, but\nthere is a definition of the ultimate which is common to all schools,\neven though there is no commonly agreed defined example to illustrate\nsuch definition. (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 293) \nWhere the Indian Buddhist philosophical schools party their company,\nKagyü argues, is their conception of the defined example of the\nultimate. For the realists (dngos smra ba) ultimate truth is a\nfoundational entity (rdzas su yod pa) that withstands rational\nanalysis. The Madhyamaka rejects this, and argues that if ultimate\ntruth is a foundational entity, it is not possible to attain an\nawakening to it. If it is possible to attain awakening, then ultimate\ntruth is impossible to be a foundational enity, for the two mutually\nexclude each other. The foundational entity, like substance of the\nBrahmanical metaphysicians, does not allow modification or change to\ntake place whereas the attainment of awakening is an ongoing process\nof modification and change. (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 294) \nFrom the position Kagyü takes, it is clear then, that it does not\nendorse Gelug's position that the Prāsaṅgika has its own\ntheory of the two truths which affords a unique framework within which\na presentation of the definition and the defined example of the two\ntruths can be set out. Kagyü argues that the\nPrāsaṅgika's project is purely for pedagogical and\nheuristic reasons, “for it seeks to assuage the cognitive errors\nof its opponents—the non-buddhists, our own-schools such as\nVaibhāṣika on upto the Svātantrika—who assert\nphilosophical positions based on certain texts.” (Mikyö\nDorje 2006: 294) The non-Prāsaṅgika philosophical schools\nequate the definition of the ultimate with the defined example, and\nthis is the malady that the Prāsaṅgika seeks to allay.\nTherefore the Prāsaṅgika's role, as Kagyü sees it, is\nto point out the absurdities in the non-Prāsaṅgika position\nand to show that the definition of the ultimate and the defined\nexample are rather two separate issues, and that they cannot be\nidentified with each other. (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 294–95) The\nPrāsaṅgika does not, like Nyingma, entertain any position\nof its own, except for the purpose of a therapeutic reason, and for\nwhich “the Prāsaṅgika relies on the convention as a\nframework for things that need to be cultivated and those that are to\nbe abandoned. For this our own position does not need to base the\nlinguistic conventions on the concepts of definition and the defined\nexample. Instead [our position],” says Kagyü,\n“conforms to the non-analytical mundane practice in which what\nneeds to be abandoned and what needs to cultivated are undertaken in\nagreement with the real-unreal discourses of the conventional\n[truth].” (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 295) \nTherefore according to Kagyü, the position of all Indian Buddhist\nphilosophical schools—be it higher or lower—agree in so\nfar as the definitions of the two truths are concerned. (1)\n“[Ultimate truth] is that which reasoned analysis does not\nundermine and that which withstands reasoned analysis. Conventional\ntruth is the reverse. (2) Ultimate is the non-deceptive nature and it\nexists as reality. Conventional [truth] is the reverse. (3) Ultimate\nis the object of the non-erroneous subject. Conventional [truth] is\nthe object of the erroneous subject.” (Mikyö Dorje 2006:\n294) Of these three definitions, the first one proposes conventional\ntruth as one that does not withstands reasoned analysis whereas\nultimate truth does indeed withstand the reasoned analysis.\n“Conventional [truth] is a phenomenon that is found to exist\nfrom the perspective of the cognitive processes that are either\nnon-analytical (ma dpyad pa) or slightly analytical (cung zad dpyad\npa), whereas ultimate [truth] is that which is found either from the\nperspective of the cognitive process that is thoroughly analytical\n(shing tu legs par dpyad pa) or meditative equipoise.”\n(Mikyö Dorje 2006: 274) Conventional truth is non-analytical in\nthe sense that ordinary beings assume its reality uncritically, and\nbecome fixated to its reifications in virtue of how it appears to\ntheir uncritical minds, rather than how it really is from the critical\ncognitive perspective. When conventional truth is slightly analysed,\nhowever, it reveals that it exists merely as collocations of the\ncodependent causes and conditions. (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 273)\nTherefore conventional truth is “one that is devoid of an\nintrinsic reality, rather it is mere name (ming tsam),\nmere sign (rda tsam), mere linguistic convention\n(tha snyad tsam), mere conception (rnam par rtog pa tsam) and\nmere fabrication (sgro btags pa tsam)—one that merely\narises or ceases due to the force of the expressions or the conceptual\nlinguistic convention.” (Mikyö Dorje 2006: 273) Ultimate\ntruth is defined, on the other hand, as one that is found by\nanalytical cognitive process or by a meditative equipoise of the\nexalted beings, for the reason that when it is subjected to analysis,\nphenomena are fundamentally, by its very nature transcendent of the\nelaborations (spros pa) and all symbolisms (mtshan ma). (Mikyö\nDorje 2006: 273) \nOn the second definition “Conventional truth is that which does\nnot deceive the perspective to which it appears (snang ngor), or that\nwhich does not deceive an erroneous perspective (‘khrul ngor),\nor that which is non-deceptive according to the standard of the\nmundane convention.” (Kun Khyen Padkar, 2004: 66) Ultimate\ntruth, on the other hand, is defined as “that which does not\ndeceive a correct perception (yang dag pa'i mthong ba), or that which\ndoes not deceive reality as it is (gnas lugs la mi bslu ba), or that\nwhich does not deceive an awakened perspective (sang rgyas kyi gzigs\nngor).” (Kun Khyen Padkar, 2004: 74) \nThe third definition is based on the two conflicting epistemic\npractices. Here ultimate is defined as an ultimate object from the\nperspective of exalted beings (ārya / ‘phags pa). The\nultimate reality, although, is not one that is regarded as cognitively\nfound to exist in and of itself inherently (rang gi bdag nyid).\nConventional truth is defined as the cognitive process that sees\nunreal phenomena (brdzun pa mthong ba) from the perspective of the\nordinary beings whose cognitive processes are obscured by the\ncataracts of confusion. Conventional truth is unreal, for it does not\nexist in the manner in which it is perceived by the confused cognitive\nprocesses of the ordinary beings. (Mikyö Dorje 2006:\n269–70) Karmapa Mikyö Dorje puts the point in this way.\n“Take a vase as one entity, for instance. It is a conventional\nentity, for it is a reality for the ordinary beings, and it is found\nto be the basis from which arise varieties of hypothetical\nfabrications. The exalted beings,” he argues, “however, do\nnot see any of these [fabrications], anywhere, whatsoever, and this\nmode of seeing by way of not seeing anything at all is termed\nas the seeing of the ultimate. Therefore the two truths, in\nthis sense, are not distinct. They are differentiated from the\nperspective of the cognitive processes that are either erroneous or\nnon-erroneous.” (Mikyö Dorje, 2006: 274) \nAlthough, like Nyingma and Sakya it is the view of Kagyü to\nmaintain that erroneous cognitive process represents the nature of the\nordinary beings, whereas non-erroneous cognitive processes represent\nthe exalted beings. However, unlike Nyingma and Sakya, Kagyü\ninsists that the distinctions between the two truths has nothing to do\nwith the perspective of the exalted beings. Everything, it claims, has\nto do with how ordinary beings fabricate things erroneously—one\nmore real than the other—and that it has nothing to do with how\nexalted beings experience things. “Even this distinction is made\nfrom the point of view of the cognitive process of the childish\nbeings. Since all things the childish beings perceive are\ncharacteristically unreal (brdzun pa) and deceptive (bslu ba), they\nconstitute the conventionality. The exalted beings, however, do not\nperceive at all anything in the way in which the childish beings\nperceive and fabricate. So ultimate truth is, according to Kagyü,\nthat which is unseen and unfound by the exalted beings since it is the\nway things really are. Therefore both the truths are taught for the\npedagogical reasons in accord with the perspective of the childish\nbeings, but not because the exalted beings experienced the two truths\nor that there really exist the two truths. (Mikyö Dorje 2006:\n274) \nWhat follows from the above discussion is that Kagyü is monist\nabout truth (Karmapa Mikyö Dorje, 2006: 302) in that it claims\nonly one truth and that truth it equates with transcendent wisdom.\nDespite minor differences, Nyingma, Kagyü and Sagya all emphasize\nthe synthesis between transcendent wisdom and ultimate truth, arguing\nthat “there is neither separate ultimate truth apart from the\ntranscendent wisdom, nor transcendent wisdom apart from the ultimate\ntruth.”(2006: 279) For this reason Kagyü advances the view\nsimilar to Nyingma and Sakya that the exceptional quality of awakened\nknowledge consists in not experiencing anything conventional or\nempirical from the enlightened perspective, but experiencing\neverything from the other's—nonenlightened—perspective.\n(Karmapa Mikyö Dorje, 2006: 141–42ff) \nFinally, on the relationship of the two truths, Kagyü maintains a\nposition which is consciously ambiguous—that they are\nexpressible neither as identical nor distinct. Responding to an\ninterlocutory question, “Are the two truths identical or\ndistinct?” Karmapa Mikyö Dorjé, says, “neither\nis the case.” And he advances three arguments to support this\nposition. First, “From a perspective of the childish beings,\n[the two truths] are neither identical, for they do not see the\nultimate; nor are they distinct, for they do not see them\nseparately.” (Karmapa Mikyö Dorjé, 2006: 285)\nSecond, “From standpoint of the meditative equipoise of the\nexalted beings, the two truths are neither identical, for the\nappearance of the varieties of conventional entities do not appear to\nthem. Nor are they distinct, for they are not perceived as\ndistinct.” (Karmapa Mikyö Dorjé, 2006: 285) The\nthird is the relativity argument which says, “They are all\ndefined relative to one another—unreality is relative to reality\nand reality is relative to unreality. Because one is defined relative\nto the other, one to which it is related (ltos sa) could not be\nidentical to that which it relates (ltos chos). This is because it is\ncontradictory for one thing to be both that which relates (ltos chos)\nand the related (ltos sa). Nor is it the case that they are distinct\nbecause,” according to Kagyü's view, “when the\nrelated is not established, so is the other [i.e., one that relates]\nnot established. Hence there is no relation. If one insists that\nrelation is still possible, then such a relation would not be relative\nto another.” (Karmapa Mikyö Dorjé, 2006:\n285–86) \nSo from these three arguments, Kagyü concludes that the two\ntruths are neither expressible as identical nor distinct. It argues\nthat “just as the conceptual images of a golden vase and a\nsilver vase do not become distinct on the account of them not being\nexpressed as identical. Likewise these images do not become identical\non the account of them not being expressed as distinct.”\n(Mikyö Dorjé, 2006: 286) \nSakya's theory of two truths is defended in the works of the\nsuccession of Sakya scholars—Sakya Paṅḍita\n(1182–1251), Rongtön Shakya Gyaltsen (Rong ston\nŚākya rgyal tshan, 1367–1449), the translator Taktsang\nLotsawa (Stag tsang Lo tsā ba, 1405–?), Gorampa Sonam Senge\n(Go rams pa Bsod nams seng ge, 1429–89) and Shakya Chogden\n(Śākya Mchog ldan, 1428–1509). In particular Gorampa\nSonam Senge's works are unanimously recognised as the authoritative\nrepresentation of the Sakya's position. Sakya agree with Nyingma and\nKagyü in maintaining that the distinction between the two truths\nis merely subjective processes, and that the two truths are reducible\nto the two conflicting perspectives. (Sakya Paṅḍita 1968a:\n72d, Rongtön Shakya Gyaltsen n.d. 7f, Taktsang Lotsawa n.d.: 27,\nShakya Chogden 1975a: 3–4ff, 15f)—“Although there\nare not two truths in terms of the object's ontological mode of being\n(gnas tshul), the truths are divided into two in terms of\n[the contrasting perspectives of] the mind that sees the mode of\nexistence and the mind that does not see the mode of\nexistence…This makes perfect sense.” (Gorampa 1969a:\n374ab) Since it emphasizes the subjective nature of the distinction\nbetween the two truths, it proposes “mere mind” (blo\ntsam) to be the basis of the division. (Gorampa 1969a: 374ab) It\naruges that “Here in the Madhyamaka system, the object itself\ncannot be divided into two truths. Conventional truth and ultimate\ntruth are divided in terms of the modes of apprehension (mthong\ntshul)—in terms of the subject apprehending unreality and\nthe subject apprehending reality; or in terms of mistaken and\nunmistaken apprehensions (‘khrul ma ‘khrul); or\ndeluded or undeluded apprehensions (rmongs ma rmongs); or\nerroneous or nonerroneous apprehensions (phyin ci log ma\nlog); or reliable cognition or unreliable cognitions (tshad\nma yin min).” (Gorampa 1969a: 375b) He also adds that:\n“The position which maintains that the truths are divided in\nterms of the subjective consciousness is one that all\nPrāsaṅgikas and Svātantrikas of India unanimously\naccepted because they are posited in terms of the subjective cognitive\nprocesses depending on whether it is deluded (rmongs) or\nnondeluded (ma rmongs), a perception of unreality (brdzun\npa thong ba) or a perception of reality (yang dag mthong\nba), and mistaken (khrul) or incontrovertible (ma\nkhrul). (1969a: 384c) \nSakya's advances two reasons to support its position. First, since the\nminds of ordinary beings are always deluded, mistaken, and erroneous,\nthey falsely experience conventional truth. Conventional truth is thus\nposited only in relation to the perspective of the ordinary\n beings.[2]\n The wisdom of exalted meditative equipoise is however never mistaken,\nit is always nondeluded, and nonerroneous, hence exalted beings\nflawlessly experience ultimate truth. Ultimate truth is thus posited\nstrictly in relation to the cognitive perspective of exalted beings.\nSecond, the view held by Sakya argues for separate cognitive agents\ncorresponding to each of the two truths. Ordinary beings have direct\nknowledge of conventional truth, but are utterly incapable of knowing\nultimate truth. The exalted beings in training have direct knowledge\nof the ultimate in their meditative equipoise and direct knowledge of\nthe conventional truth in the post meditative states. Fully awakened\nbuddhas, on the other hand, only have access to ultimate truth. They\nhave no access to conventional truth whatsoever from the\nenlightened perspective, although they may access\nconventional truth from the perspective of ordinary deluded\nbeings. \nEtymologically Sakya characterizes ultimate (parama) as a\nqualification of transcendent exalted cognitive process\n(‘jig rten las ‘das pa'i ye shes,\nlokottarajñāna) that belongs to exalted beings with\nartha as its corresponding object. The sense of ultimate\ntruth (paramārthasatya) grants primacy to the exalted\ntranscendent cognitive process of the noble beings, which supersedes\nthe ontological status of conventional phenomena. (Gorampa 1969a:\n377d) “There is no realization and realized object, nor is there\nobject and subject.” (Gorampa 1969b: 714f, 727–729) As\nTaktsang Lotsawa puts it: “A wisdom without dual appearance is\nwithout any object.” (Taktsang n.d.: 305f) Strictly speaking,\ntranscendent wisdom itself becomes the ultimate truth. “Ultimate\ntruth is to be experienced under a total cessation of dualistic\nappearance through exalted personal wisdom,” and further,\n“Anything that has dualistic appearance, even omniscience,must\nnot be treated as ultimate truth.” (Gorampa 1969b:\n612–13ff) \nTherefore conventionality (saṃvṛti, kun rdzob) means\nprimal ignorance. (Gorampa, 1969b: 377b, Sakya Paṇḍita\n1968a: 72b, Shakya Chogden 1975a: 30f, Rongtön Shakya Gyaltsen\n1995: 288) In agreement with Nyingma and Kagyü, Sakya treats\nprimal ignorance as the villain responsible for projecting the entire\nsystem of conventional truths. It argues ignorance as constituting the\ndefining characteristics of the conventional\n truth.[3]\n (Sakya Paṇḍita 1968a: 72, Rendawa 1995: 121, Shakya\nChogden 1975b: 378f, 1975c: 220, Taktsang Lotsawa n.d.: 27f,\nRongtön Shakya Gyaltsen 1995: 287, n.d: 6–7ff) It\nformulates the definitions of the two truths in terms of the\ndistinctions between the ignorant experiences of ordinary beings and\nthe enlightened experiences of noble beings during their meditative\nequipoise. Sakya's definition is based on three reasons. First, each\nconventionally real phenomenon satisfies only the definition of\nconventional truth because each phenomenon has only a conventional\nnature (in contrast to the two nature theory of Gelug), and that\nultimate truth has a transcendent ontological status. Second, that\neach cognitive agent is potentially capable of knowing only one truth\nexhaustively, being equipped with either the requisite conventionally\nreliable cognitive process or ultimately reliable cognitive process.\nFor each truth must be verified by a different individual, and that\naccess to the two truths is mutually exclusive—a cognitive agent\nwho knows conventional truth cannot know ultimate truth and vice versa\nexcept in the case of exalted beings who are not fully enlightened.\nThird, that each conventional entity has only one nature, namely, its\nconventional nature, and the so-called ultimate nature must not be\nassociated with any conventionally real phenomenon. If a sprout, for\nexample, actually did possess two natures as proposed in Gelug's\ntheory of the two truths, then, according to Sakya, each nature would\nhave to be ontologically distinct. Since the ontological structure of\nthe sprout cannot be separated into a so-called conventional and\nultimate nature, the sprout must possess only one phenomenal nature,\ni.e., the conventional reality. As this nature is found only under the\nspell of ignorance, it can be comprehended only under the conventional\ncognitive processes of ordinary beings, and of unenlightened noble\nbeings in their post meditative equipoise. It is therefore not\npossible, in Sakya's view, to confine the definition of ultimate truth\nto the framework of conventional phenomena. \nUltimate truth, on the other hand, requires the metaphysical\ntranscendence of conventionality. Unlike conventional reality, it is\nneither presupposed nor projected by ignorance. Ultimate truth, in\nGorampa's words: “is inexpressible through words and is beyond\nthe scope of cognition.” (1969a: 370a) The cognition is always\nconceptual and thus deluded. “Yet ultimate truth is experienced\nby noble beings in their meditative equipoise, and is free from all\nconceptual categories. It cannot be expressed through\ndefinition, through any defined object, or through anything\nelse.” (1969a: 370a) In fact, Sakya goes so far as to combine\nthe definition of ultimate truth with that of intrinsic\nreality (rang bzhin, svabhāva). When an\ninterlocutor ask this question: “What is the nature of the\nreality of phenomena?” Gorampa replies that reality is\ntranscendent and it has three defining characteristics: namely:\n“It is not created by causes and conditions, it exists\nindependently of conventions and of other phenomena; and it does not\nchange.” (Gorampa, 1969c: 326a) Like Nāgārjuna's\nhypothetical, not real, intrinsic reality, Sakya claims that\nultimate truth is ontologically unconditioned, and hence it\nis not a dependently arisen phenomenon; it is distinct from\nconventional phenomena in every sense of the word; it is\nindependent of conceptual-linguistic conventions; it is a\ntimeless and unchanging phenomenon. \nIt is clear then, according to Sakya view, any duality ascribed to\ntruth is untenable. Since there is only one truth, it cannot be\ndistinguished any further. Like Nyingma and Kagyü, Sakya holds\nthe view that truth itself is not divisible. (Sakya\nPaṇḍita n.d.: 32ab, Rendawa 1995: 122, Rongtön Shakya\nGyaltsen, 1995: 287, n.d.: 22f Taktsang Lotsawa (n.d.: 263, Shakya\nChogden 1975a: 7–8ff, 1975c: 222f) It agrees with Nyingma and\nKagyü that the distinction between the two truths is essentially\nbetween two conflicting perspectives, rather than any division within\ntruth as such. In Shakya Chogden's words: “Precise enumeration\n(grangs nges) of the twofold truth all the earlier Tibetans\nhave explained rests on the precise enumeration of the mistaken\ncognition (blo ‘khrul) and unmistaken cognition\n(blo ma ‘khrul). With this underpinning reason, they\nexplained the precise enumeration through the elimination of the third\nalternative. There is not even a single figure to be found who claims\nthe view comparable with the latter [i.e., Gelug], who asserts a\nprecise enumeration of the twofold truth based on the certification of\nreliable cognitive processes.” (1975a: 9–10ff) \nSakya rejects the reality of conventional truth by treating it as a\nprojection of conventional mind—it is the ignorance of ordinary\nbeings. When asked this question: “If this were true, even the\nmere term conventional truth would be unacceptable, for\nwhatever is conventional is incompatible with truth,” Gorampa\nReplies: “Since [conventional] truth is posited only in relation\nto a conventional mind, there is no problem. Even so-called real\nconventionalities (yang dag kun rdzob ces pa yang) are\nposited as real with respect to a conventional mind.” (1969b:\n606b) By “conventional mind,” Gorampa means the ignorant\nmind of an ordinary being experiencing the phenomenal world. In other\nwords, conventional truth is described as “truth” only\nfrom the perspective of ignorance. It is a truth projected (sgro\nbrtag pa) by it and taken for granted. \nSakya equates conventional truth with “the appearances of\nnonexistent entities like illusions.” (Gorampa 1969c: 287c) It\nfollows Sakya Paṇḍita on this point who puts it:\n“Conventional truths are like reflections of the moon in the\nwater—despite their nonexistence, they appear due to\nthoughts.” (Sakya Paṇḍita 1968a: 72a) According to\nSakya Paṇḍita “The defining characteristic of\nconventional truth constitutes the appearances of the nonexistent\nobjects.” (1968a: 72a) In this sense, conventional truths\n“are things apprehended by the cognition perceiving conventional\nentities. Those very things are found as nonexistent by the cognition\nanalyzing their mode of existence that is itself posited as the\nultimate.” (Gorampa 1969a: 377a) \nSince mere mind is the basis of the division of the two truths wherein\nultimate truth—wisdom—alone is seen as satisfying the\ncriterion of truth, so conventional truth—ignorance—cannot\nproperly be taken as truth. Wisdom and ignorance are invariably\ncontradictory, and thus the two truths cannot coexist. Sakya argues,\nin fact, that conventional truth must be negated in the ascent to\nultimate truth. Given wisdom's primacy over ignorance, in the final\nanalysis it is ultimate truth alone that must prevail without its\nmerely conventional counterpart. Conventional truth is an expedient\nmeans to achieve ultimate truth, and the Buddha described conventional\ntruth as truth to suit the mentality of ordinary beings. (Gorampa\n1969a: 370b) The two truths are thus categorized as a means\n(thabs) and a result (thabs byung).\nConventional truth is the means to attain the one and only ultimate\ntruth. \nAccording to this view, then, the relationship between the two truths\nis equivalent to the relationship between the two conflicting\nperspectives—namely, ignorance and wisdom. The question now\narises: How is ignorance related to wisdom? Or conversely, how does\nwisdom relate to ignorance? It says that the two truths are distinct\nin the sense that they are incompatible with unity, like\nentity and without entity. In the ultimate sense, it argues,\nthe two truths transcend identity and difference. (Gorampa, 1969a:\n376d) The transcendence of identity and difference from the ultimate\nstandpoint is synonymous with the transcendence of identity and\ndifference from the purview of the meditative equipoise of noble\nbeings. However, from the conventional standpoint, it claims that the\ntwo truths are distinct in the sense that they are incompatible with\ntheir unity. It likens this relationship to the one between\nentity and without entity. (Gorampa, 1969a:\n377a) \nSakya's claim that the two truths are distinct and incompatible\nencompasses both ontological and epistemological distinctions. Since\nwhat is divided into the two truths is mere mind, it is\nobvious that there is no single phenomenon that could serve as the\nobjective referent for both. This also means that the two truths must\nbe construed as corresponding to distinct spheres belonging to\ndistinct modes of consciousness: conventional truth corresponds to\nignorance and ultimate truth to wisdom. It is thus inappropriate to\ndescribe the relationship between the two truths, and their\ncorresponding modes of consciousness, in terms of two ways of\nperceiving the same entity. Although the two truths can be\nthought of as two ways of perceiving, one based on ignorance\nand the other on wisdom, there is no same entity perceived by\nboth. There is nothing common between the two truths, and if they are\nboth ways of perceiving, then they do not perceive the same thing. \nAccording to this view, the relationship between conventional truth\nand ultimate truth is analogous to the relationship between the\nappearance of falling hairs when vision is impaired by cataracts and\nthe absence of such hairs when vision is unimpaired. Although this is\na metaphor, it has a direct application to determining the\nrelationship between the two truths. Conventional truth is like seeing\nfalling hairs as a result of cataracts: both conventional truth and\nsuch false seeing are illusory, in the ontological sense that there is\nnothing to which each corresponds, and in the epistemological sense\nthat there is no true knowledge in either case. Ultimate truth is\ntherefore analogous, ontologically and epistemologically, to the true\nseeing unimpaired by cataracts and free of the appearance of falling\nhairs. Just as cataracts give rise to illusory appearances, so\nignorance, according to Sakya, gives rise to all conventional truths;\nwisdom, on the other hand, gives rise to ultimate truth. As each is\nthe result of a different state, there is no common link between them\nin terms of either an ontological identity or an epistemological or\nconceptual identity. \nGelug's (Dge lugs) theory of the two truths is campioned by Tsongkhapa\nLobsang Dragpa (Tsong khapa Blo bzang grags pa, 1357–1419).\nTsongkhapa's theory is adopted, expanded and defended in the works of\nhis immediate disciples—Gyaltsab Jé (Rgyal tshab Rje,\n1364–1432), Khedrub Jé (Mkhas grub Rje, 1385–1438),\nGendün Drub (Dge ‘dun grub,1391–1474)—and other\ngreat Gelug thinkers such as Sera Jetsün Chökyi Gyaltsen (Se\nra Rje tsun Chos kyi rgyal tshan, 1469–1544), Panchen Sönam\nDragpa (Paṇ chen Bsod nams grags pa,1478–1554), Panchen\nLobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen (Paṇ chen Blo bzang chos kyi rgyal\ntshan,1567–1662), Jamyang Shepai Dorje (‘Jam dbyangs Bzhad\nba'i Rdo rje, 1648–1722), Changkya Rölpai Dorje (Lcang skya\nRol pa'i rdo rje, 1717–86), Könchog Jigmé Wangpo\n(Kon mchog ‘jigs med dbang po, 1728–91), and many others\nscholars. \nGelug maintains that “objects of knowledge” (shes\nbya) are the basis for dividing the two truths. (Tsongkhapa\n 1984b:176)[4]\n This means that the two truths relate to “two objects of\nknowledge,” the idea it takes from the statement of the Buddha\nfrom Discourse on Meeting of the Father and the Son\n(Pitāputrasamāgama\n Sūtra)[5]\n By object of knowledge Gelug means an object that is\ncognizable (blo'i yul du bya rung ba). It must be an object\nof cognitive processes in general ranging from those of ordinary\nsentient beings through to those of enlightened beings. This\ndefinition attempts to capture any thing knowable in the broadest\npossible sense. Since the Buddha maintains knowledge of the two truths\nto be necessary for awakening, the understanding of the two truths\nmust constitute an exhaustive understanding of all objects of\nknowledge. \nGelug's key argument to support this claim comes from its two-nature\ntheory in which it has been argued that every nominally (tha\nsnyad) or conventionally (kun rdzob) given phenomenon\npossesses dual natures: namely, the nominal (or conventional\nnature) and the ultimate nature. The conventional nature is\nunreal and deceptive while the ultimate nature is real and\nnondeceptive. Since two natures pertain to every phenomenon, the\ndivision of the two truths means the division of each entity into two\nnatures. Thus the division of the two truths, “reveals that it\nmakes sense to divide even the nature of a single entity, like a\nsprout, into dual natures—its conventional and its ultimate\nnatures. It does not however show,” as non-Gelug schools have\nit, “that the one nature of the sprout is itself divided into\ntwo truths in relation to ordinary beings (so skye) and to\nnoble beings (āryas).” (Tsongkhapa 1984b: 173,\n1992: 406) \nThe relation of the two truths comes down to the way in which the\nsingle entity appears to cognitive processes—deceptively and\nnondeceptively. The two natures correspond to these deceptive or\nnondeceptive modes of appearance. While they both belong to the same\nontological entity, they are epistemically or conceptually mutually\nexclusive. Take a sprout for instance. If it exists, it necessarily\nexhibits a dual nature, and yet those two natures cannot be\nontologically distinct. The ultimate nature of the sprout cannot be\nseparate from its conventional nature—its color, texture, shape,\nextension, and so on. As an object of knowledge, the sprout retains\nits single ontological basis, but it is known through its two natures.\nThese two natures exclude one another so far as knowledge is\nconcerned. The cognitive process that knows the deceptive conventional\nnature of the sprout does not have direct access to its nondeceptive\nultimate nature. Similarly, the cognitive process that apprehends the\nnondeceptive ultimate nature of the sprout does not have direct access\nto its deceptive conventional nature. In Newland's words: “A\ntable and its emptiness are a single entity. When an ordinary\nconventional mind takes a table as its object of observation, it sees\na table. When a mind of ultimate analysis searches for the table, it\nfinds the emptiness of the table. Hence, the two truths are posited in\nrelation to a single entity by way of the perspectives of the\nobserving consciousness. This is as close as Ge-luk-bas will come to\ndefining the two truths as perspectives.” (1992: 49) \nGelug's two-nature theory not only serves as the basic reference point\nfor its exposition of the basis of the division of the two truths,\ntheir meanings and definitions, but also serves as the basic\nontological reference for its account of the relationship between the\ntwo truths. Therefore Gelug proposes the view that the two truths are\nof single entity with distinct conceptual identities. This view is\nalso founded on the theory of the two natures. But how are the two\nnatures related? Are they identical or distinct? For Gelug argues that\nthere are only two possibilities: either the two natures are identical\n(ngo bo gcig) or distinct (ngo bo tha dad); there\ncannot be a third. (Tsongkhapa 1984b:176) They are related in terms of\nbeing a single entity with distinct conceptual identities—thus\nthey are both the same and different. Since the two natures are the\nbasis of the relationship between the two truths, the relationship\nbetween the two truths will reflect the relationship between the two\nnatures. Just as the two natures are of a same entity, ultimate truth\nand conventional truth are of same ontological status. \nGelug argues that the relationship between the two truths, therefore,\nthe two natures, is akin to the relationship between being conditioned\nand being impermanent. (Tsongkhapa 1984b:176) It appropriates this\npoint from Nāgārjuna's Bodhicittavivaraṇa,\nwhich states: “Reality is not perceived as separate from\nconventionality. The conventionality is explained to be empty. Empty\nalone is the conventionality, if one of them does not exist, neither\nwill the other, like being conditioned and being impermanent.”\n(v.67–68) (Nāgārjuna 1991:45–45, cited\nTsongkhapa, 1984b: 176; Khedrub Jé 1992: 364) Commenting on\nthis passage from the Bodhicittavivaraṇa, Tsongkhapa\nargues that the first four lines (in original Tibetan verses) show\nthat things as they really are, are not ontologically distinct from\nthat of the conventionality. The latter two lines (in the original\nTibetan verse) show their relationship such that if one did not exist,\nneither could the other (med na mi ‘bung ba'i ‘brel\nba). This, in fact, he says, is equivalent to their being\nconstituted by a single-property relationship (bdag cig\npa'i ‘brel ba). Therefore, like the case of being\nconditioned and being impermanent, the relation between the two truths\nis demonstrated as one of a single ontological identity. (Tsongkhapa\n1984b: 176–77) \nThe way in which the two truths are related is thus analogous to the\nrelationship between being conditioned and being impermanent. They are\nontologically identical and mutually entailing. Just as a conditioned\nstate is not a result of impermanence, so emptiness is not a result of\nthe conventional truth (the five aggregates) or the destruction of the\nfive aggregates—Hence in the Vimalakırtinirdeśa\nSūtra it is stated: “Matter itself is void. Voidness\ndoes not result from the destruction of matter, but the nature of\nmatter is itself voidness.” (Vimalakīrti, 1991:74) The same\nprinciple applies in the case of consciousness and the emptiness of\nconsciousness, as well as to the rest of the five psychophysical\naggregates—the aggregate and its emptiness are not causally\nrelated. For the causal relationship would imply either the aggregate\nis the cause, therefore its emptiness is the result, or the aggregate\nis the result, and its emptiness the cause. This would imply,\naccording to Gelug's reading, either the aggregate or the emptiness is\ntemporally prior to its counterpart, thus leading to the conlusion\nthat the conventional truth and ultimate truth exist independently of\neach other. Such a view is for Gelug is completely unacceptable. \nThe ontological identity between being conditioned and being\nimpermanent does not imply identity in all and every\nrespect. Insofar as their epistemic mode is concerned, conditioned and\nimpermanent phenomena are distinct and contrasting. The concept\nimpermanence always presents itself to the cognizing mind as\nmomentary instants, but not as conditioned. Similarly, the concept\nbeing-conditioned always presents itself to its cognizing\nmind as constituted by manifold momentary instants, but not as\nmoments. Thus it does not necessarily follow that the two truths are\nidentical in every respect just because they share a common\nontological identity. Where the modes of conceptual appearance are\nconcerned, ultimate nature and conventional nature are distinct. The\nconceptual mode of appearance of ultimate truth is nondeceptive and\nconsistent with its mode of existence, while that of conceptual mode\nof conventional truth is deceptive and inconsistent with its mode of\nexistence. \nConventional truth is uncritically confirmed by conventionally\nreliable cognitive process, whereas ultimate truth is critically\nconfirmed by ultimately reliable cognitive process. Hence, just as\nultimate truth is inaccessible to the conventionally reliable\ncognitive process for its uncritical mode of engagement, so, too, is\nconventional truth inaccessible to ultimately reliable cognitive\nprocess for its critical mode of engagement. This is how, in Gelug's\nview, the truths differ conceptually despite sharing a common\nontological entity. In summarizing Gelug's argument, Khedrub Jé\nwrites: “The two truths are therefore of the same nature, but\ndifferent conceptual identities. They have a single-nature\nrelationship such that, if one did not exist, neither could the other,\njust like being conditioned and impermanent.” (1992: 364) \nThe two nature theory also supports Gelug's view that the truth is\ntwofold. Since the two natures of every conventional phenomenon\nprovide the ontological and epistemological foundation for each of the\ntruths, the division of truth into two is entirely appropriate. Both\nthe conventional and the ultimate are actual truths, and since the two\nnatures are mutually interlocking, neither of the two truths has\nprimacy over the other—both have equal status, ontologically,\nepistemologically, and even soteriologically. \nGiven Gelug's stance on conventional truth as actual truth and its\nargument for the equal status of the two truths, Gelug must now\naddress the question: How can conventional truth, which is unreal\n(false) and deceptive, be truth (real) at all? In other words, how can\nthe two truths be of equal status given if conventional truth is\nunreal (false)? The success of Gelug's reply depends on its ability to\nmaintain harmony between the two truths, or their equal footing.There\nare several arguments by means of which Gelug defends this. The first,\nand the most obvious one, is the argument from the two-nature theory.\nIt argues since two truths are grounded in the dual nature of a single\nphenomenon, then “just as the ultimate reality of the sprout\n[for instance] is taken as characteristic of the sprout, hence it is\ndescribed as the sprout's nature, so, too,” explains Tsongkhapa,\n“are the sprout's color, shape, etc., the sprout's\ncharacteristics. Therefore they too are its nature.”\n(1992: 406) Since the two natures are ontologically mutually\nentailing, the sprout's ultimate truth cannot exist ontologically\nseparate from its conventional truth, and vice versa. Neither truth\ncould exist without the other. \nThe most important argument Gelug advances for the unity of the two\ntruths draws upon an understanding of the compatible relation between\nconventional truth and dependent arising on the one hand, and between\nultimate truth and emptiness on the other. For Gelug emptiness and\ndependent arising are synonymous. The concept of emptiness is\nincoherent unless it means dependent arising, and equally the concept\nof dependent arising is incoherent unless it means emptiness of\nintrinsic reality. Gelug argues, as Tsongkhapa does in the Rten\n‘brel stod pa (In Praise of Dependent Arising, 1994a),\nsince emptiness means dependent arising, the emptiness of intrinsic\nreality and the efficacy of action and its agent are not\ncontradictory. If emptiness, however, is misinterpreted as\ncontradictory with dependent arising, then Gelug contends, there would\nbe neither action in empty phenomena, nor empty phenomena in action.\nBut that cannot be the case, for that would entail a rejection of both\nphenomena and action, a nihilistic view. (v.11–12) Since there\nis no phenomenon other than what is dependently arisen, there is no\nphenomenon other than what is empty of intrinsic reality. (v.15)\nUnderstood emptiness in this way, there is indeed no need to say that\nthey are noncontradictory—the utter nonexistence of\nintrinsic reality and making sense of everything in the light of\nthe principle this arises depending on this. (v.18) This is\nso because despite the fact that whatever is dependently arisen lacks\nintrinsic reality, and therefore empty, nonetheless its existence is\nillusion-like. (v.27) \nSometimes Gelug varies its ontological argument slightly, as does\nTsongkhapa in the Lam gtso rnam gsum (The Three Principal\nPathways), to stressing the unity of the two truths in terms of\ntheir causal efficiency. It argues that empty phenomena is causally\nefficient is crucial in understanding the inextricable relationship\nbetween ultimate truth and conventional truth. The argument takes two\nforms: (1) appearance avoids realism—the extreme of\nexistence, and (2) emptiness avoids inhilism—the\nextreme of nonexistence. The former makes sense for Gelug\nbecause the appearance arises from causal conditions, and whatever\narises from the causal conditions is a non-eternal or non-permanent.\nWhen the causal conditions changes any thing that dependently arises\nfrom them also changes. Thus the appearance avoids the realism. The\nlatter makes sense because the empty phenomena arises from causal\nconditions, and whatever arise from the causal conditions is not a\nnon-existent, even though it lacks intrinsic reality. Only when the\ncausal conditions are satisfied do we see arising of the empty\nphenomena. Hence by understanding that the empty phenomenon itself is\ncausally efficient, the bearer of cause and effect, one is not robbed\nby the extreme view of nihilism. (1985: 252) \nThe argument for the unity of the two truths also takes\nepistemological form which also rests on the idea that emptiness and\ndependently arising are unified. The knowledge of empty phenomena is\nconceptually interlinked with that of dependently arisen\nphenomena—the latter is, in fact, founded on the former. To the\nextent that empty phenomena are understood in terms of relational and\ndependently arisen phenomena, to that extent empty phenomena are\nalways functional and causally effective. The phrase “empty\nphenomena,” although expressed negatively, is not negative in a\nmetaphysical sense—it is not equivalent to no-thingness.\nAlthough the empty phenomenon appears to its cognizing consciousness\nnegatively and without any positive affirmation, it is nonetheless\nequivalent to a relational and dependently arisen phenomenon seen\ndeconstructively. Since seeing phenomena as empty does not violate the\ninevitable epistemic link with the understanding of phenomena as\ndependently arisen, and the converse also applies, so the unity\nbetween the two truths—understanding things both as empty and as\ndependently arisen—is still sustained. \nThe unity between the two truths, according to Gelug, does not apply\nmerely to ontological and epistemological issues; it applies equally\nto soteriology—the practical means to the freedom from\nsuffering. As Jamyang Shepai Dorje argues that undermining either of\nthe two truths would result in a similar downfall—a similar\neventual ruin. If, however, they are not undermined, the two are alike\ninsofar as the accomplishment of the two accumulations and the\nattainment of the two awakened bodies (kāyas), and so forth, are\nconcerned. If one undermines conventional truth or denies it's\nreality, one would succumb to the extreme of nihilism, which would\nalso undermine the fruit and the means by which an awakened physical\nbody (rūpakāya) is accomplished. It is therefore not\nsensible to approach the two truths with bias. Since this relation\ncontinues as a means to avoid falling into extremes, and also to\naccomplish the two accumulations and attain the two awakened bodies\n(kāyas), it is imperative, says Jamyang Shepai Dorje, that the\ntwo truths be understood as mutually interrelated. (1992:\n898–99) \nOne could object Gelug's position as follows: If the two natures are\nontologically identical, why is conventional truth unreal and\ndeceptive, while ultimate truth real and nondeceptive? To this Gelugs\nreplies that “nondeceptive is the mode of reality (bden\ntshul) of the ultimate. That is, ultimate truth does not deceive\nthe world by posing one mode of appearance while existing in another\nmode.” (1992: 411) Ultimate truth is described as\nultimate, not because it is absolute or higher than\nconventional truth, but simply because of its consistent character,\ntherefore non-deceptive—its mode of appearance and its mode of\nbeing are the same—in contrast with the inconsistent (therefore\ndeceptive) character of conventional truth. Ultimate truth is\nnondeceptive for the same reason. The premise follows because to the\ncognizing consciousness, conventional truth presents itself as\ninherently or instrinsically real. It appears to be substance, or\nessence, and therefore it deceives ordinary beings. Insofar\nas conventional truth presents itself as more than\nconventional—as inherently real—they deceive the ordinary\nbeings. We take them to be what they are not—to be intrinsically\nand objectively real. In that sense, they are unreal. “But to\nthe extent that we understand them as dependently arisen, empty,\ninterdependent phenomena,” as Garfield explains, “they\nconstitute a conventional truth.” (1995: 208) \nAnother objection may be advanced as follows: Gelug's position\ncontradicts the Buddha's teachings since it is not possible to\nreconcile Gelug's view that there are two actual truths with the\nBuddha's declaration that nirvāṇa is the only\n truth.[6]\n For its answer to this objection Gelug appropriates\nCandrakīrti's\nYuktiṣaṣṭikāvṛtti which states\nthat nirvāṇa is not like conditioned phenomena, which\ndeceives the childish by presenting false appearances. For the\nexistence of nirvāṇa is always consistent with its\ncharacteristic of the nonarising nature. Unlike conditioned phenomena,\nit never appears, even to the childish, as having a nature of arising\n(skye ba'i ngo bo). Since nirvāṇa is always\nconsistent with the mode of existence of nirvāṇa, it is\nexplained as the noble truth. Yet this explanation is afforded\nstrictly in the terms of worldly conventions. (1983:\n14–15ff, cited in Tsongkhapa 1992: 312, Khedrub Jé 1992:\n360) \nFor Gelug the crucial point here, as Candrakīrti emphasizes, is\nthat nirvāṇa is the truth strictly in terms of worldly\nconventions. Gelug recognizes this linguistic convention as a\nhighly significant to the Prāsaṅgika system and it insists\non conformity with the worldly conventions for the the following\nreasons. First, just as an illusion, a mirror image, etc., are real in\nan ordinary sense, despite the fact that they are deceptive and\nunreal, so, too, conventional phenomena in the Prāsaṅgika\nMadhyamaka sense are conventionally real, and can even be said to\nconstitute truths, despite being recognized by the Mādhyamikas\nthemselves as unreal and deceptive. Second, because the concept\nultimate truth is also taken from its ordinary convention,\nnirvāṇa is spoken of as ultimate on the ground of\nits nondeceptive nature, in the sense that its mode of existence is\nconsistent with its mode of appearance. The nondeceptive nature of the\nempty phenomenon itself constitutes its reality, and so it is\nconventionally described as ultimate in the Prāsaṅgika\nsystem. \nThus Gelug asserts that neither of the two truths is more or less\nsignificant than the other. Indeed, while the illusion only makes\nsense as illusion in relation to that which is not illusion, the\nreflection only makes sense as reflection in relation to that which is\nreflected. So, too, does the real only make sense as real in relation\nto the illusion, the thing reflected in relation to its reflection.\nThis also holds in the case of discussions about the ultimate nature\nof things, such as the being of the sprout—it only makes sense\ninasmuch as it holds in discussions of ordinary phenomena. The only\ncriterion that determines a thing's truth in the Prāsaṅgika\nMadhyamaka system, according to Gelug, is the causal effectiveness of\nthe thing as opposed to mere heuristic significance. The\nsprout's empty mode of being and its being as appearance are both\ntruths, insofar as both are causally effective, and thus both\nfunctional. \nThe two truths, understood as, respectively, the empty and the\ndependently arisen characters of phenomena, are on equal footing\naccording to Gelug. Nevertheless these truths have different\ndesignations—the sprout's empty mode is always described as\n“ultimate truth,” while the conventional properties, such\nas color and shape, are described as “conventional\ntruths.” The former is accepted as nondeceptive truth\nwhile the sprout's conventional properties are accepted as\ndeceptive or false truth, despite common sense\ndictating that they are true and real. \nIn conclusion Gelug's theory of the two truths is based on one\nfundamental thesis that each conventionally real phenomenon satisfies\nthe definitions of both truths for each phenomenon, as it sees it,\npossesses two natures that serve as the basis of the definitions of\nthe two truths. The two truths are conceptual distinctions applied to\na particular conventionally real phenomenon, and every conventionally\nreal phenomenon fulfills the criterion of both truths because each\nphenomenon constitutes these two natures they are not merely\none specific nature of a phenomenon mirrored in two different\nperspectives. As each phenomenon possesses two natures, so each\nverifying cognitive process has a different nature as its referent,\neven though there is only one ontological entity and one cognitive\nagent involved. \nGelug considers the two natures of each phenomenon as the defining\nfactor of the two truths. It argues that the conventional nature of an\nentity, as verified by a conventionally reliable cognitive process,\ndetermines the defining criterion of conventional truth; the ultimate\nnature of the same entity, as verified by an ultimately reliable\ncognitive practice, determines the defining criterion of ultimate\ntruth. Since both truths are ontologically as well as\nepistemologically interdependent, knowledge of conventionally real\nentitity as dependently arisen suffices for knowledge of both truths.\nIn contasty non-Gelug schools—Nyingma, Kagyü and Sakya\nNon-Gelug, as we have seen, rejects Gelug's dual-nature theory,\ntreating each conventional entity as satisfying only the definition of\nconventional truth and taking the definition of ultimate truth to be\nontologically and epistemologically transcendent from conventional\ntruth. They argue, instead, it is through the perspectives of either\nan ordinary being or an unenlightened exalted being\n(āryas) that the definition of conventional truth is\nverified—fully enlightened being (buddhas) do not\nexperience the conventional truth in any respect. Similarly, for\nnon-Gelug, no ordinary being can experience the ultimate truth.\nUltimate truth transcends conventional truth, and the knowledge of\nempirically given phenomena as dependently arisen could not satisfy\nthe criterion of knowing ultimate truth. \nFor Gelug, there is an essential compatibility between between the two\ntruths, for the reason that there is a necessary harmony between\ndependently arisen and emptiness of intrinsic reality. As dependently\narisen, empty phenomena are not constructions of ignorant\nconsciousness, so neither is conventional truth such a construction.\nBoth truths are actual truths that stand on an equal footing.\nMoreover, according to this view, whosoever knows conventional truth,\neither directly or inferentially, also knows ultimate truth; whosoever\nknows ultimate truth, also knows phenomena as dependently arisen, and\nhence knows them as empty of intrinsic reality. Where there is no\nknowledge of conventional truth, the converse applies. For non-Gelug,\nthe incommensurability between dependently arisen and emptiness of\nintrinsic reality also applies to the two truths. Accordingly,\nwhosoever knows conventional truth does not know ultimate truth, and\none who knows ultimate truth does not know conventional truth;\nwhosoever knows phenomena as dependently arisen does not know them as\nempty, whereas whosoever knows phenomena as empty does not know them\nas dependently arisen. \nWhile Gelug thus distances itself from the subjective division of the\ntwo truths, Nyingma, Kagyü and Sakya attempt to demonstrate the\nvalidity of their view by arguing that perspective provides the\nprimary basis for the division of the two truths. Unlike Gelug,\nnon-Gelug schools hold that the two truths do not have any objective\nbasis. Instead they are entirely reducible to the experiences of the\ndeluded minds of ordinary beings and the experiences of the wisdom of\nexalted being. \nAccording to Gelug, the agent who cognizes the two truths may be one\nand the same individual. Each agent may have all the requisite\ncognitive resources that are potentially capable of knowing both\ntruths. Ordinary beings have only conceptual access to ultimate truth,\nwhile exalted beings, who are in the process of learning, have direct,\nbut intermittent, access. Awakenened beings, however, invariably have\nsimultaneous access to both truths. The view held by non-Gelug argues\nfor separate cognitive agents corresponding to each of the two truths.\nOrdinary beings have direct knowledge of conventional truth, but are\nutterly incapable of knowing ultimate truth. The exalted beings in\ntraining directly know ultimate while they are meditative equipoise\nand conventional truth in post meditative states. Fully awakened\nbuddhas, on the other hand, only have access to ultimate truth.\nAwakened beings have no access to conventional truth whatsoever from\nthe enlightened perspective, although they may access conventional\ntruth from unenlightened ordinary perspectives.","contact.mail":"sonam.thakchoe@utas.edu.au","contact.domain":"utas.edu.au"}]
