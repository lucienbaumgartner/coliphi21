A widespread, perhaps universally accepted idea is that\npart of what should distinguish logical truths from other kinds of truths\nis that logical truths should have a yet to be fully understood modal\nforce. It is typical to hold that, in some sense or senses of\n“could”, a logical truth could not be false or,\nalternatively, that in some sense or senses of “must”, a\nlogical truth must be true. But there is little if any agreement about\nhow the relevant modality should be understood.\n\n\n\nAnother widespread idea is that part of what should distinguish logical\ntruths is that they should be in some sense yet to be fully understood\n“formal”. That a logical truth is formal implies at the\nvery least that all the sentences which are appropriate replacement\ninstances of its logical form are logical truths too. In this context,\nthe logical form of a sentence \\(S\\) is supposed to be a certain\nschema determined uniquely by \\(S\\), a schema of which \\(S\\)\nis a replacement instance, and of which sentences with the same form\nas \\(S\\) are replacement instances too. A form has at the very\nleast the property that the expressions in it which are not schematic\nletters (the “logical expressions”) are widely applicable\nacross different areas of discourse. Among people who accept the idea\nof formality there would be wide agreement that the forms of (1), (2)\nand (3) would be something like \\((1')\\), \\((2')\\) and \\((3')\\)\nrespectively:\n\n\\((1')\\)\n    \nIf \\(a\\) is \\(P\\) only if \\(b\\) is \\(Q\\), and \\(a\\) is \\(P\\), then \\(b\\) is \\(Q\\).\n\n\n\\((2')\\)\n    \nIf no \\(Q\\) is \\(R\\) and some \\(P\\)s are \\(Q\\)s, then some \\(P\\)s are not \\(R\\).\n\n\n\\((3')\\)\n    \nIf \\(a\\) is a \\(P\\) and all \\(P\\)s are \\(Q\\), then \\(a\\) is \\(Q\\).\n\n\n\n\\((1')\\), \\((2')\\) and \\((3')\\) do seem to give rise to logical\ntruths for all appropriate replacements of the letters\n“\\(a\\)”, “\\(b\\)”,\n“\\(P\\)”, “\\(Q\\)”, and\n“\\(R\\)”. And expressions such as “if”,\n“and”, “some”, “all”, etc., which\nare paradigmatic logical expressions, do seem to be widely applicable\nacross different areas of discourse. But the idea that logical truths\nare or should be formal is certainly not universally accepted. And\neven among those who accept it, there is little if any agreement about\nwhat generic criteria determine the form of an arbitrary\nsentence.[1]\n\n\n\nA remarkable fact about logical truth is that many have thought it\nplausible that the set of logical truths of certain rich formalized\nlanguages is characterizable in terms of concepts of standard\nmathematics. In particular, on some views the set of logical truths of\na language of that kind is always the set of sentences of the language\nderivable in a certain calculus. On other, more widespread views, the\nset of logical truths of a language of that kind can be identified with\nthe set of sentences that are valid across a certain range of\nmathematical interpretations (where validity is something related to\nbut different from the condition that all the sentences that are\nreplacement instances of its form be true too; see below, section 2.3).\nOne main achievement of early mathematical logic was precisely to show\nhow to characterize notions of derivability and validity in terms of\nconcepts of standard mathematics. (Sections 2.2 and 2.3 give a basic\ndescription of the mathematically characterized notions of derivability\nand validity, with references to other entries.)\n\n\n\nIn part 1 of this entry we will describe in very broad outline the\nmain existing views about how to understand the ideas of modality and\nformality relevant to logical truth. (A more detailed treatment of\nthese views is available in other entries mentioned below, and\nespecially in the entries on the\n analytic/synthetic distinction and\n logical constants.) In part 2 we\n will describe, also in outline, a particular set of philosophical\nissues that arise when one considers the attempted mathematical\ncharacterizations of logical truth. The question of whether or in what\nsense these characterizations are correct is bound with the question\nof what is or should be our specific understanding of the ideas of\nmodality and\n formality.[2]\n\n\n\nAs we said above, it seems to be universally accepted that, if there\nare any logical truths at all, a logical truth ought to be such that\nit could not be false, or equivalently, it ought to be such that it\nmust be true. But as we also said, there is virtually no agreement\nabout the specific character of the pertinent modality. \n\nExcept among those who reject the notion of logical truth altogether,\nor those who, while accepting it, reject the notion of logical form,\nthere is wide agreement that at least part of the modal force of a\nlogical truth is due to its being a particular case of a universal\ngeneralization over the possible values of the schematic letters in\n“formal” schemata like \\((1')-(3')\\). (These values may\nbut need not be expressions.) On what is possibly the oldest way of\nunderstanding the logical modality, that modal force is entirely due\nto this property: thus, for example, on this view to say that (1) must\nbe true can only mean that (1) is a particular case of the true\nuniversal generalization “For all suitable \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\), if \\(a\\) is a \\(P\\) only if \\(b\\) is a \\(Q\\), and \\(a\\) is\na \\(P\\), then \\(b\\) is a \\(Q\\)”. On one traditional (but not\nuncontroversial) interpretation, Aristotle's claim that the conclusion\nof a syllogismos must be true if the premises are true ought\nto be understood in this way. In a famous passage of the Prior\nAnalytics, he says: “A syllogismos is speech\n(logos) in which, certain things being supposed, something\nother than the things supposed results of necessity (ex\nanankes) because they are so” (24b18–20).  Think of\n(2) as a syllogismos in which the “things\nsupposed” are (2a) and (2b), and in which the thing that\n“results of necessity” is (2c): \n\nOn the interpretation we are describing, Aristotle's view is that to\nsay that (2c) results of necessity from (2a) and (2b) is to say that\n(2) is a particular case of the true universal generalization “For all\nsuitable \\(P\\), \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\), if no \\(Q\\) is\n\\(R\\) and some \\(P\\)s are \\(Q\\)s, then some \\(P\\)s\nare not \\(R\\)”. For this interpretation see e.g.  Alexander of\nAphrodisias, 208.16 (quoted by Łukasiewicz 1957, §41),\nBolzano (1837, §155) and Łukasiewicz (1957, §5). \n\nIn many other ancient and medieval logicians, “must” claims are\nunderstood as universal generalizations about actual items (even if\nthey are not always understood as universal generalizations on\n“formal” schemata). Especially prominent is Diodorus' view that a\nproposition is necessary just in case it is true at all times (see\nMates 1961, III, §3). Note that this makes sense of the idea that\n(2) must be true but, say, “People watch TV” could be false, for\nsurely this sentence was not true in Diodorus' time. Diodorus' view\nappears to have been very common in the Middle Ages, when authors like\nWilliam of Sherwood and Walter Burley seem to have understood the\nperceived necessity of conditionals like (2) as truth at all times\n(see Knuuttila 1982, pp. 348–9). An understanding of necessity as\neternity is frequent also in later authors; see e.g.,\nKant, Critique of Pure Reason, B 184. In favor of the\nmentioned interpretation of Aristotle and of the Diodorean view it\nmight be pointed out that we often use modal locutions to stress the\nconsequents of conditionals that follow from mere universal\ngeneralizations about the actual world, as in “If gas prices go up,\nnecessarily the economy slows down”. \n\nMany authors have thought that views of this sort do not account for\nthe full strength of the modal import of logical truths. A nowadays\nvery common, but (apparently) late view in the history of philosophy,\nis that the necessity of a logical truth does not merely imply that\nsome generalization about actual items holds, but also implies that\nthe truth would have been true at a whole range of counterfactual\ncircumstances. Leibniz assigned this property to necessary truths such\nas those of logic and geometry, and seems to have been one of the\nfirst to speak of the counterfactual circumstances as “possible\nuniverses” or worlds (see the letter to Bourguet, pp. 572–3, for a\ncrisp statement of his views that contrasts them with the views in the\npreceding paragraph; Knuuttila 1982, pp. 353 ff. detects the earliest\ntransparent talk of counterfactual circumstances and of necessity\nunderstood as at least implying truth in all of these in\nDuns Scotus and\nBuridan; see also the entry on\n medieval theories of modality).\n In contemporary writings the understanding of necessity as truth in\nall counterfactual circumstances, and the view that logical truths are\nnecessary in this sense, are widespread—although many, perhaps\nmost, authors adopt “reductivist” views of modality that see talk of\ncounterfactual circumstances as no more than disguised talk about\ncertain actualized (possibly abstract) items, such as linguistic\ndescriptions. Even Leibniz seems to have thought of his “possible\nuniverses” as ideas in the mind of God. (See Lewis 1986 for an\nintroduction to the contemporary polemics in this area.) \n\nHowever, even after Leibniz and up to the present, many logicians seem\nto have avoided a commitment to a strong notion of necessity as truth\nin all (actual and) counterfactual circumstances. Thus Bolzano, in\nline with his interpretation of Aristotle mentioned above,\ncharacterizes necessary propositions as those whose negation is\nincompatible with purely general truths (see Bolzano 1837, §119).\nFrege says that “the apodictic judgment [i.e., roughly, the\njudgment whose content begins with a “necessarily”\ngoverning the rest of the content] is distinguished from the assertory\nin that it suggests the existence of universal judgments from which\nthe proposition can be inferred, while in the case of the assertory\none such a suggestion is lacking” (Frege 1879, §4).  Tarski\nis even closer to the view traditionally attributed to Aristotle, for\nit is pretty clear that for him to say that e.g. (2c)\n“must” be true if (2a) and (2b) are true is to say that\n(2) is a particular case of the “formal” generalization\n“For all suitable \\(P\\), \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\), if\nno \\(Q\\) is \\(R\\) and some \\(P\\)s are \\(Q\\)s, then\nsome \\(P\\)s are not \\(R\\)” (see Tarski 1936a, pp. 411,\n415, 417, or the corresponding passages in Tarski 1936b; see also Ray\n1996).  Quine is known for his explicit rejection of any modality that\ncannot be understood in terms of universal generalizations about the\nactual world (see especially Quine 1963). In some of these cases, this\nattitude is explained by a distrust of notions that are thought not to\nhave reached a fully respectable scientific status, like the strong\nmodal notions; it is frequently accompanied in such authors, who are\noften practicing logicians, by the proposal to characterize logical\ntruth as a species of validity (in the sense of 2.3 below). \n\nOn a recent view developed by Beall and Restall (2000, 2006), called\nby them “logical pluralism”, the concept of logical truth\ncarries a commitment to the idea that a logical truth is true in all\nof a range of items or “cases”, and its necessity consists\nin the truth of such a general claim (see Beall and Restall 2006,\np. 24). However, the concept of logical truth does not single out a\nunique range of “cases” as privileged in determining an\nextension for the concept; instead, there are many such equally\nacceptable ranges and corresponding extensions, which may be chosen as\na function of contextual interests. This means that, for the logical\npluralist, many sets have a right to be called “the set\nof logical truths” (and “the set of logical necessities”),\neach in the appropriate\n context.[3] \n(See the entry on\n logical pluralism.) \nOn another recent understanding of logical necessity as a species of\ngenerality, proposed by Rumfitt (2015), the necessity of a logical\ntruth consists just in its being usable under all sets of\nsubject-specific ways of drawing implications (provided these sets\nsatisfy certain structural rules); or, more roughly, just in its being\napplicable no matter what sort of reasoning is at stake. On this view,\na more substantive understanding of the modality at stake in logical\ntruth is again not required. It may be noted that, although he\npostulates a variety of subject-specific implication relations,\nRumfitt rejects pluralism about logical truth in the sense of Beall\nand Restall (see his 2015, p. 56, n. 23.), and in fact thinks that the\nset of logical truths is characterized by the standard classical\nlogic. \n\nYet another sense in which it has been thought that truths like\n(1)-(3), and logical truths quite generally, “could” not\nbe false or “must” be true is epistemic. It is an old\nobservation, going at least as far back as Plato, that some truths\ncount as intuitively known by us even in cases where we don't seem to\nhave any empirical grounds for them. Truths that are knowable on\nnon-empirical grounds are called a priori (an expression that\nbegins to be used with this meaning around the time of Leibniz; see\ne.g. his “Primæ Veritates”, p. 518). The axioms and\ntheorems of mathematics, the lexicographic and stipulative\ndefinitions, and also the paradigmatic logical truths, have been given\nas examples.  If it is accepted that logical truths are a\npriori, it is natural to think that they must be true or could\nnot be false at least partly in the strong sense that their negations\nare incompatible with what we are able to know non-empirically. \n\nAssuming that such a priori knowledge exists in some way or\nother, much recent philosophy has occupied itself with the issue of\nhow it is possible. One traditional (“rationalist”) view\nis that the mind is equipped with a special capacity to perceive\ntruths through the examination of the relations between pure ideas or\nconcepts, and that the truths reached through the correct operation of\nthis capacity count as known a priori. (See, e.g., Leibniz's\n“Discours de Métaphysique”, §§23 ff.;\nRussell 1912, p. 105; BonJour 1998 is a very recent example of a view\nof this sort.) An opposing traditional (“empiricist”) view\nis that there is no reason to postulate that capacity, or even that\nthere are reasons not to postulate it, such as that it is\n“mysterious”. (See the entry on\n rationalism vs. empiricism.)\n Some philosophers, empiricists and otherwise, have attempted to\nexplain a priori knowledge as arising from some sort of\nconvention\nor tacit agreement to assent to certain sentences\n(such as (1)) and use certain rules.\nHobbes in his objections to Descartes'\nMeditations (“Third Objections”, IV, p. 608)\nproposes a wide-ranging conventionalist view.  The later Wittgenstein\n(on one interpretation) and Carnap are distinguished proponents of\n“tacit agreement” and conventionalist views (see e.g.\nWittgenstein 1978, I.9, I.142; Carnap 1939, §12, and 1963, p.\n916, for informal exposition of Carnap's views; see also Coffa 1991,\nchs. 14 and 17). Strictly speaking, Wittgenstein and Carnap think that\nlogical truths do not express propositions at all, and are just\nvacuous sentences that for some reason or other we find useful to\nmanipulate; thus it is only in a somewhat diminished sense that we can\nspeak of (a priori) knowledge of them. However, in typical\nrecent exponents of “tacit agreement” and conventionalist\nviews, such as Boghossian (1997), the claim that logical truths do not\nexpress propositions is rejected, and it is accepted that the\nexistence of the agreement provides full-blown a priori\nknowledge of those propositions. \n\nThe “rational capacity” view and the\n“conventionalist” view agree that, in a broad sense, the\nepistemic ground of logical truths resides in our ability to analyze\nthe meanings of their expressions, be these understood as conventions\nor as objective ideas. For this reason it can be said that they\nexplain the apriority of logical truths in terms of their analyticity. \n(See the entry on the\n analytic/synthetic distinction.)\nKant's explanation of the apriority of logical truths has seemed harder to \nextricate.[4] \nA long line of commentators of Kant has noted that, if Kant's view is\nthat all logical truths are analytic, this would seem to be in tension\nwith his characterizations of analytic truths. Kant characterizes\nanalytic truths as those where the concept of the predicate is\ncontained in or identical with the concept of the subject, and, more\nfundamentally, as those whose denial is contradictory. But it has\nappeared to those commentators that these characterizations, while\napplying to strict tautologies such as “Men are men” or\n“Bearded men are men”, would seem to leave out much of\nwhat Kant himself counts as logically true, including syllogisms such\nas (2) (see e.g. Mill 1843, bk. II, ch. vi, §5; Husserl 1901,\nvol. II, pt. 2, §66; Kneale and Kneale 1962, pp. 357–8;\nParsons 1967; Maddy 1999). This and the apparent lack of clear\npronouncements of Kant on the issue has led at least Maddy (1999) and\nHanna (2001) to consider (though not accept) the hypothesis that Kant\nviewed some logical truths as synthetic a priori. On an\ninterpretation of this sort, the apriority of many logical truths\nwould be explained by the fact that they would be required by the\ncognitive structure of the transcendental subject, and specifically by\nthe forms of \n judgment.[5] \nBut the standard interpretation is to attribute to Kant the view that\nall logical truths are analytic (see e.g. Capozzi and Roncaglia\n2009). On an interpretation of this sort, Kant's forms of judgment may\nbe identified with logical concepts susceptible of analysis (see\ne.g. Allison 1983, pp. 126ff.). An extended defense of the\ninterpretation that Kant viewed all logical truths as analytic,\nincluding a vindication of Kant against the objections of the line of\ncommentators mentioned above, can be found in Hanna (2001),\n§3.1. A substantively Kantian contemporary theory of the\nepistemology of logic and its roots in cognition is developed in Hanna\n(2006); this theory does not seek to explain the apriority of logic in\nterms of its analyticity, and appeals instead to a specific kind of\nlogical intuition and a specific cognitive logic faculty. (Compare\nalso the anti-aprioristic and anti-analytic but broadly Kantian view\nof Maddy 2007, mentioned below.) \n\nThe early Wittgenstein shares with Kant the idea that the logical\nexpressions do not express meanings in the way that non-logical\nexpressions do (see 1921, 4.0312). Consistently with this view, he\nclaims that logical truths do not “say” anything (1921,\n6.11). But he seems to reject conventionalist and “tacit\nagreement” views (1921, 6.124, 6.1223). It is not that logical\ntruths do not say anything because they are mere instruments for some\nsort of extrinsically useful manipulation; rather, they\n“show” the “logical properties” that the world\nhas independently of our decisions (1921, 6.12, 6.13). It is unclear\nhow apriority is explainable in this framework. Wittgenstein calls the\nlogical truths analytic (1921, 6.11), and says that “one can\nrecognize in the symbol alone that they are true” (1921,\n6.113). He seems to have in mind the fact that one can\n“see” that a logical truth of truth-functional logic must\nbe valid by inspection of a suitable representation of its\ntruth-functional content (1921, 6.1203, 6.122). But the extension of\nthe idea to quantificational logic is problematic, despite\nWittgenstein's efforts to reduce quantificational logic to\ntruth-functional logic; as we now know, there is no algorithm for\ndeciding if a quantificational sentence is valid. What is perhaps more\nimportant, Wittgenstein gives no discernible explanation of why in\nprinciple all the “logical properties” of the world should\nbe susceptible of being reflected in an adequate notation. \n\nAgainst the “rational capacity”,\n“conventionalist”, Kantian and early Wittgensteinian\nviews, other philosophers, especially radical empiricists and\nnaturalists (not to speak of epistemological skeptics), have rejected\nthe claim that a priori knowledge exists (hence by\nimplication also the claim that analytic propositions exist), and they\nhave proposed instead that there is only an illusion of apriority.\nOften this rejection has been accompanied by criticism of the other\nviews.  J.S. Mill thought that propositions like (2) seem a\npriori merely because they are particular cases of early and very\nfamiliar generalizations that we derive from experience, like\n“For all suitable \\(P\\), \\(Q\\) and\n\\(R\\), if no \\(Q\\) is \\(R\\) and some \\(P\\)s are\n\\(Q\\)s, then some \\(P\\)s are not \\(R\\)” (see Mill\n1843, bk. II, ch. viii). Bolzano held a similar view (see Bolzano\n1837, §315). Quine (1936, §III) famously criticized the\nHobbesian view noting that since the logical truths are potentially\ninfinite, our ground for them must not lie just in a finite number of\nexplicit conventions, for logical rules are presumably needed to\nderive an infinite number of logical truths from a finite number of\nconventions (a point derived from Carroll 1895). Later Quine\n(especially 1954) criticized Carnap's conventionalist view, largely on\nthe grounds that there seems to be no non-vague distinction between\nconventional truths and truths that are tacitly left open for\nrefutation, and that to the extent that some truths are the product of\nconvention or “tacit agreement”, such agreement is\ncharacteristic of many scientific hypotheses and other postulations\nthat seem paradigmatically non-analytic. (See Grice and Strawson 1956\nand Carnap 1963 for reactions to these criticisms.)  Quine (especially\n1951) also argued that accepted sentences in general, including\nparadigmatic logical truths, can be best seen as something like\nhypotheses that are used to deal with experience, any of which can be\nrejected if this helps make sense of the empirical world (see Putnam\n1968 for a similar view and a purported example). On this view there\ncannot be strictly a priori grounds for any truth. Three\nrecent subtle anti-aprioristic positions are Maddy's (2002, 2007),\nAzzouni's (2006, 2008), and Sher's (2013). For Maddy, logical truths\nare a posteriori, but they cannot be disconfirmed merely by\nobservation and experiment, since they form part of very basic ways of\nthinking of ours, deeply embedded in our conceptual machinery (a\nconceptual machinery that is structurally similar to Kant's postulated\ntranscendental organization of the understanding). Similarly, for\nAzzouni logical truths are equally a posteriori, though our\nsense that they must be true comes from their being psychologically\ndeeply ingrained; unlike Maddy, however, Azzouni thinks that the\nlogical rules by which we reason are opaque to introspection. Sher\nprovides an attempt at combining a Quinean epistemology of logic with\na commitment to a metaphysically realist view of the modal ground of\nlogical truth. \n\nOne way in which a priori knowledge of a logical truth such\nas (1) would be possible would be if a priori knowledge of\nthe fact that (1) is a logical truth, or of the universal\ngeneralization “For all\nsuitable \\(a\\), \\(P\\), \\(b\\) and \\(Q\\),\nif \\(a\\) is \\(P\\) only if \\(b\\) is\n\\(Q\\), and \\(a\\) is \\(P\\), then \\(b\\) is\n\\(Q\\)” were possible. One especially noteworthy kind of\nskeptical consideration in the epistemology of logic is that the\npossibility of inferential a priori knowledge of these facts\nseems to face a problem of circularity or of infinite regress. If we\nare to obtain inferential a priori knowledge of those facts,\nthen we will presumably follow logical rules at some point, including\npossibly the rule of modus ponens whose very correctness\nmight well depend in part on the fact that (1) is a logical truth or\non the truth of the universal generalization “For all\nsuitable \\(a\\), \\(P\\), \\(b\\) and \\(Q\\),\nif \\(a\\) is \\(P\\) only if \\(b\\) is\n\\(Q\\), and \\(a\\) is \\(P\\), then \\(b\\) is\n\\(Q\\)”. In any case, it seems clear that not all claims of\nthis latter kind, expressing that a certain truth is a logical truth\nor that a certain logical schema is truth-preserving, could be given\nan a priori inferential justification without the use of some\nof the same logical rules whose correctness they might be thought to\ncodify. The point can again be reasonably derived from Carroll\n(1895). Some of the recent literature on this consideration, and on\nanti-skeptical rejoinders, includes Dummett (1973, 1991) and\nBoghossian (2000). \n\nOn most views, even if it were true that logical truths are true in\nall counterfactual circumstances, a priori, and analytic,\nthis would not give sufficient conditions for a truth to be a logical\ntruth. On most views, a logical truth also has to be in some sense\n“formal”, and this implies at least that all truths that\nare replacement instances of its form are logical truths too (and\nhence, on the assumption of the preceding sentence, true in all\ncounterfactual circumstances, a priori, and analytic). To use\na slight modification of an example of Albert of Saxony (quoted by\nBocheński 1956, §30.07), “If a widow runs, then a\nfemale runs” should be true in all counterfactual\ncircumstances, a priori, and analytic if any truth\nis. However, “If a widow runs, then a log runs” is a\nreplacement instance of its form, and in fact it even has the same\nform on any view of logical form (something like “If\na \\(P\\) \\(Q\\)s, then an \\(R\\) \\(Q\\)s”), but\nit is not even true simpliciter. So on most views, “If\na widow runs, then a female runs” is not a logical truth. \n\nFor philosophers who accept the idea of formality, as we said above,\nthe logical form of a sentence is a certain schema in which the\nexpressions that are not schematic letters are widely applicable\nacross different areas of\n discourse.[6] \nIf the schema is the form of a logical truth, all of its replacement\ninstances are logical truths. The idea that logic is especially\nconcerned with (replacement instances of) schemata is of course\nevident beginning with Aristotle and the Stoics, in all of whom the\nword usually translated by “figure” is\nprecisely schema. In Aristotle a figure is actually an even\nmore abstract form of a group of what we would now call\n“schemata”, such as (2′). Our schemata are closer to\nwhat in the Aristotelian syllogistic are the moods; but there seems to\nbe no word for “mood” in Aristotle (except\npossibly ptoseon in 42b30 or tropon in 43a10; see\nSmith 1989, pp. 148–9), and thus no general reflection on the\nnotion of formal schemata. There is explicit reflection on the\ncontrast between the formal schemata or moods and the matter\n(hyle) of syllogismoi in Alexander of Aphrodisias\n(53.28ff., quoted by Bocheński 1956, §24.06), and there has\nbeen ever since. The matter are the values of the schematic\nletters. \n\nThe idea that the non-schematic expressions in logical forms, i.e.\nthe logical expressions, are widely applicable across different areas\nof discourse is also present from the beginning of logic, and recurs\nin all the great logicians. It appears indirectly in many passages\nfrom Aristotle, such as the following: “All the sciences are\nrelated through the common things (I call common those which they use\nin order to demonstrate from them, but not those that are demonstrated\nin them or those about which something is demonstrated); and logic is\nrelated to them all, as it is a science that attempts to demonstrate\nuniversally the common things” (Posterior Analytics,\n77a26–9); “we don't need to take hold of the things of all\nrefutations, but only of those that are characteristic of logic; for\nthese are common to every technique and ability”\n(Sophistical Refutations, 170a34–5).  (In these texts\n“logic” is an appropriate translation of\ndialektike; see Kneale and Kneale 1962, I, §3, who\ninform us that logike is used for the first time with its\ncurrent meaning in Alexander of Aphrodisias.) Frege says that “the\nfirmest proof is obviously the purely logical, which, prescinding from\nthe particularity of things, is based solely on the laws on which all\nknowledge rests” (1879, p. 48; see also 1885, where the universal\napplicability of the arithmetical concepts is taken as a sign of their\nlogicality). The same idea is conspicuous as well in Tarski (1941, ch.\nII, §6). \n\nThat logical expressions include paradigmatic cases like\n“if”, “and”, “some”,\n“all”, etc., and that they must be widely applicable\nacross different areas of discourse is what we might call “the\nminimal thesis” about logical expressions. But beyond this there\nis little if any agreement about what generic feature makes an\nexpression logical, and hence about what determines the logical form\nof a sentence. Most authors sympathetic to the idea that logic is\nformal have tried to go beyond the minimal thesis. It would be\ngenerally agreed that being widely applicable across different areas\nof discourse is only a necessary, not sufficient property of logical\nexpressions; for example, presumably most prepositions are widely\napplicable, but they are not logical expressions on any implicit\ngeneric notion of a logical expression. Attempts to enrich the notion\nof a logical expression have typically sought to provide further\nproperties that collectively amount to necessary and sufficient\nconditions for an expression to be logical. \n\nOne idea that has been used in such characterizations, and that is\nalso present in Aristotle, is that logical expressions do not,\nstrictly speaking, signify anything; or, that they do not signify\nanything in the way that substantives, adjectives and verbs signify\nsomething. “Logic [dialektike] is not a science of determined\nthings, or of any one genus” (Posterior Analytics,\n77a32–3). We saw that the idea was still present in Kant and the early\nWittgenstein. It reemerged in the Middle Ages. The main sense of the\nword “syncategorematic” as applied to expressions was roughly this\nsemantic sense (see Kretzmann 1982, pp.  212 ff.). Buridan and other\nlate medieval logicians proposed that categorematic expressions\nconstitute the “matter” of sentences while the syncategorematic\nexpressions constitute their “form” (see the text quoted by\nBocheński 1956, §26.11). (In a somewhat different, earlier,\ngrammatical sense of the word, syncategorematic expressions were said\nto be those that cannot be used as subjects or predicates in\ncategorical propositions; see Kretzmann 1982, pp. 211–2.) The idea of\nsyncategorematicity is somewhat imprecise, but there are serious\ndoubts that it can serve to characterize the idea of a logical\nexpression, whatever this may be. Most prepositions and adverbs are\npresumably syncategorematic, but they are also presumably non-logical\nexpressions.  Conversely, predicates such as “are identical”, “is\nidentical with itself”, “is both identical and not identical with\nitself”, etc., which are resolutely treated as logical in recent\nlogic, are presumably categorematic. (They are of course categorematic\nin the grammatical sense, in which prepositions and adverbs are\nequally clearly syncategorematic.) \n\nMost other proposals have tried to delineate in some other way the\nAristotelian idea that the logical expressions have some kind of\n“insubstantial” meaning, so as to use it as a necessary\nand sufficient condition for logicality. One recent suggestion is that\nlogical expressions are those that do not allow us to distinguish\ndifferent individuals. One way in which this has been made precise is\nthrough the characterization of logical expressions as those whose\nextension or denotation over any particular domain of individuals is\ninvariant under permutations of that domain. (See Tarski and Givant\n1987, p. 57, and Tarski 1966; for related proposals see also McCarthy\n1981, Sher 1991, ch. 3, McGee 1996, Feferman 1999, Bonnay 2008 and Woods 2016,\namong others.)  A permutation of a domain is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the domain and itself. For example, if \\(D\\) is\nthe domain {Aristotle, Caesar, Napoleon, Kripke}, one permutation is\nthe correspondence that assigns each man to himself; another is the\ncorrespondence \\(P\\) that assigns Caesar to Aristotle (in mathematical\nnotation, \\(P(\\text{Aristotle})=\\text{Caesar}\\)), Napoleon to Caesar,\nKripke to Napoleon, and Aristotle to Kripke. That the extension of an\nexpression over a domain is invariant under a permutation of that\ndomain means that the induced image of that extension under the\npermutation is the extension itself (the “induced image”\nof an extension under a permutation \\(Q\\) is what the extension becomes\nwhen in place of each object \\(o\\) one puts the object \\(Q(o)\\)). The\nextension of “philosopher” over \\(D\\) is not invariant under\nthe permutation \\(P\\) above, for that extension is \\(\\{\\text{Aristotle},\n\\text{Kripke}\\}\\), whose induced image under \\(P\\) is \\(\\{\\text{Caesar},\n\\text{Aristotle}\\}\\). This is favorable to the proposal, for\n“philosopher” is certainly not widely applicable, and so\nnon-logical on most views. On the other hand, the predicate “are\nidentical” has as its extension over \\(D\\) the set of pairs \nits induced image under \\(P\\), and under any other permutation of\n\\(D\\), is that very same set of pairs (as the reader may check); so\nagain this is favorable to the proposal. (Other paradigmatic logical\nexpressions receive more complicated extensions over domains, but the\nextensions they receive are invariant under permutations. For example,\non one usual way of understanding the extension of “and”\nover a domain, this is the function that assigns, to each pair\n\\(\\langle S_1, S_2 \\rangle\\), where \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) are sets of\ninfinite sequences of objects drawn from \\(D\\), the intersection of\n\\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\); and this function is permutation invariant.)  One\nproblem with the proposal is that many expressions that seem clearly\nnon-logical, because they are not widely applicable, are nevertheless\ninvariant under permutations, and thus unable to distinguish different\nindividuals. The simplest examples are perhaps non-logical predicates\nthat have an empty extension over any domain, and hence have empty\ninduced images as well. “Male widow” is one example;\nversions of it can be used as counterexamples to the different\nversions of the idea of logicality as permutation invariance (see\nGómez-Torrente 2002), and it's unclear that the proponent of\nthe idea can avoid the problem in any non ad hoc way. \n\nAnother popular recent way of delineating the Aristotelian intuition\nof the semantic “insubstantiality” of logical expressions\nappeals to the concept of “pure inferentiality”. The idea\nis that logical expressions are those whose meaning, in some sense, is\ngiven by “purely inferential” rules. (See Kneale 1956,\nHacking 1979, Peacocke 1987, Hodes 2004, among others.) A necessary\nproperty of purely inferential rules is that they regulate only\ninferential transitions between verbal items, not between extra-verbal\nassertibility conditions and verbal items, or between verbal items and\nactions licensed by those items. A certain inferential rule licenses\nyou to say “It rains” when it rains, but it's not\n“purely inferential”. A rule that licenses you to say\n“A is a female whose husband died before her” when someone\nsays “A is a widow”, however, is not immediately\ndisqualified as purely inferential. Now, presumably in some sense the\nmeaning of “widow” is given by this last rule together\nperhaps with the converse rule, that licenses you to say “A is a\nwidow” when someone says “A is a female whose husband died\nbefore her”. But “widow” is not a logical\nexpression, since it's not widely applicable; so one needs to\npostulate more necessary properties that “purely\ninferential” rules ought to satisfy. A number of such conditions\nare postulated in the relevant literature (see e.g. Belnap 1962 (a\nreply to Prior 1960), Hacking 1979 and Hodes 2004).  However, even\nwhen the notion of pure inferentiality is strengthened in these ways,\nproblems remain.  Most often the proposal is that an expression is\nlogical just in case certain purely inferential rules give its whole\nmeaning, including its sense, or the set of aspects of its use that\nneed to be mastered in order to understand it (as in Kneale 1956,\nPeacocke 1987 and Hodes 2004). However, it seems clear that some\nparadigmatic logical expressions have extra sense attached to them\nthat is not codifiable purely inferentially. For example, inductive\nreasoning involving “all” seems to be part of the sense of\nthis expression, but it's hard to see how it could be codified by\npurely inferential rules (as noted by Sainsbury 1991, pp. 316–7;\nsee also Dummett 1991, ch. 12). A different version of the proposal\nconsists in saying that an expression is logical just in case certain\npurely inferential rules that are part of its sense suffice to\ndetermine its extension (as in Hacking 1979). But it seems clear that\nif the extension of, say, “are identical” is determined by\na certain set of purely inferential rules that are part of its sense,\nthen the extension of “are identical and are not male\nwidows” is equally determined by the same rules, which arguably\nform part of its sense; yet “are identical and are not male\nwidows” is not a logical expression (see Gómez-Torrente\n2002). \n\nIn view of problems of these and other sorts, some philosophers have\nproposed that the concept of a logical expression is not associated\nwith necessary and sufficient conditions, but only with some necessary\ncondition related to the condition of wide applicability, such as the\ncondition of “being very relevant for the systematization of\nscientific reasoning” (see Warmbrōd 1999 for a position of this\ntype). Others (Gómez-Torrente 2002) have proposed that there\nmay be a set of necessary and sufficient conditions, if these are not\nmuch related to the idea of semantic “insubstantiality” and are\ninstead pragmatic and suitably vague; for example, many expressions\nare excluded directly by the condition of wide applicability; and\nprepositions are presumably excluded by some such implicit condition\nas “a logical expression must be one whose study is useful for the\nresolution of significant problems and fallacies in reasoning”. To be\nsure, these proposals give up on the extended intuition of semantic\n“insubstantiality”, and may be somewhat unsatisfactory for that\nreason. \n\nSome philosophers have reacted even more radically to the problems of\nusual characterizations, claiming that the distinction between logical\nand non-logical expressions must be vacuous, and thus rejecting the\nnotion of logical form altogether. (See e.g. Orayen 1989, ch. 4,\n§2.2; Etchemendy 1990, ch. 9; Read 1994; Priest 2001.) These\nphilosophers typically think of logical truth as a notion roughly\nequivalent to that of analytic truth simpliciter. But they\nare even more liable to the charge of giving up on extended intuitions\nthan the proposals of the previous paragraph. \n\nFor more thorough treatments of the ideas of formality and of a\nlogical expression see the entry\n logical constants,\n and MacFarlane 2000. \n\nOne important reason for the successes of modern logic is its use of\nwhat has been called “formalization”. This term is usually employed to\ncover several distinct (though related) phenomena, all of them present\nin Frege (1879). One of these is the use of a completely specified set\nof artificial symbols to which the logician unambiguously assigns\nmeanings, related to the meanings of corresponding natural language\nexpressions, but much more clearly delimited and stripped from the\nnotes that in those natural language expressions seem irrelevant to\ntruth-conditional content; this is especially true of symbols meant to\nrepresent the logical expressions of natural language. Another\nphenomenon is the stipulation of a completely precise grammar for the\nformulae construed out of the artificial symbols, formulae that will\nbe “stripped” versions of correlate sentences in natural language;\nthis grammar amounts to an algorithm for producing formulae starting\nfrom the basic symbols. A third phenomenon is the postulation of a\ndeductive calculus with a very clear specification of axioms and rules\nof inference for the artificial formulae (see the next section); such\na calculus is intended to represent in some way deductive reasoning\nwith the correlates of the formulae, but unlike ordinary deductions,\nderivations in the calculus contain no steps that are not definite\napplications of the specified rules of inference. \n\nInstead of attempting to characterize the logical truths of a natural\nlanguage like English, the Fregean logician attempts to characterize\nthe artificial formulae that are “stripped” correlates of those\nlogical truths in a Fregean formalized language. In first-order\nFregean formalized languages, among these formulae one finds\nartificial correlates of (1), (2) and (3), things like \n\n(See the entry on logic, classical.)\n Fregean formalized languages include also classical higher-order\nlanguages. (See the entry on \n logic, second-order and higher-order.)\n The logical expressions in these languages are standardly taken to be\nthe symbols for the truth-functions, the quantifiers, identity and\nother symbols definable in terms of those (but there are dissenting\nviews on the status of the higher-order quantifiers; see 2.4.3\nbelow). \n\nThe restriction to artificial formulae raises a number of questions\nabout the exact value of the Fregean enterprise for the demarcation of\nlogical truths in natural language; much of this value depends on how\nmany and how important are perceived to be the notes stripped from the\nnatural language expressions that are correlates of the standard\nlogical expressions of formalized languages. But whatever one's view\nof the exact value of formalization, there is little doubt that it has\nbeen very illuminating for logical purposes. One reason is that it's\noften clear that the stripped notes are really irrelevant to\ntruth-conditional content (this is especially true of the use of\nnatural language logical expressions for doing mathematics). Another\nof the reasons is that the fact that the grammar and meaning of the\nartificial formulae is so well delimited has permitted the development\nof proposed characterizations of logical truth that use only concepts\nof standard mathematics. This in turn has allowed the study of the\ncharacterized notions by means of standard mathematical\ntechniques. The next two sections describe the two main approaches to\ncharacterization in broad outline.[7] \n\nWe just noted that the Fregean logician's formalized grammar amounts\nto an algorithm for producing formulae from the basic artificial\nsymbols. This is meant very literally. As was clear to mathematical\nlogicians from very early on, the basic symbols can be seen as (or\ncodified by) natural numbers, and the formation rules in the\nartificial grammar can be seen as (or codified by) simple computable\narithmetical operations. The grammatical formulae can then be seen as\n(or codified by) the numbers obtainable from the basic numbers after\nsome finite series of applications of the operations, and thus their\nset is characterizable in terms of concepts of arithmetic and set\ntheory (in fact arithmetic suffices, with the help of some\ntricks). \n\nExactly the same is true of the set of formulae that are derivable in\na formalized deductive calculus. A formula \\(F\\) is derivable in\na Fregean calculus \\(C\\) just in case \\(F\\) is obtainable\nfrom the axioms of \\(C\\) after some finite series of applications\nof the rules of inference of \\(C\\). But the axioms are certain\nformulae built by the process of grammatical formation, so they can be\nseen as (or codified by) certain numbers; and the rules of inference\ncan again be seen as (or codified by) certain computable arithmetical\noperations. So the derivable formulae can be seen as (or codified by)\nthe numbers obtainable from the axiom numbers after some finite series\nof applications of the inference operations, and thus their set is\nagain characterizable in terms of concepts of standard mathematics\n(again arithmetic suffices). \n\nIn the time following Frege's revolution, there appears to have been a\nwidespread belief that the set of logical truths of any Fregean\nlanguage could be characterized as the set of formulae derivable in\nsome suitably chosen calculus (hence, essentially, as the set of\nnumbers obtainable by certain arithmetical operations). Frege himself\nsays, speaking of the higher-order language in his\n“Begriffsschrift”, that through formalization (in the\nthird sense above) “we arrive at a small number of laws in\nwhich, if we add those contained in the rules, the content of all the\nlaws is included, albeit in an undeveloped state” (Frege 1879,\n§13). The idea follows straightforwardly from Russell's\nconception of mathematics and logic as identical (see Russell 1903,\nch. I, §10; Russell 1920, pp. 194–5) and his thesis that\n“by the help of ten principles of deduction and ten other\npremises of a general logical nature (…), all mathematics can\nbe strictly and formally deduced” (Russell 1903, ch. I,\n§4). See also Bernays (1930, p. 239): “[through\nformalization] it becomes evident that all logical inference\n(…) can be reduced to a limited number of logical elementary\nprocesses that can be exactly and completely enumerated”. In the\nopening paragraphs of his paper on logical consequence, Tarski (1936a,\n1936b) says that the belief was prevalent before the appearance of\nGödel's incompleteness theorems (see subsection 2.4.3 below for\nthe bearing of these theorems on this issue).  In recent times,\napparently due to the influence of Tarskian arguments such as the one\nmentioned towards the end of subsection 2.4.3, the belief in the\nadequacy of derivability characterizations seems to have waned (see\ne.g. Prawitz 1985 for a similar appraisal). \n\nEven on the most cautious way of understanding the modality present in\nlogical truths, a sentence is a logical truth only if no sentence\nwhich is a replacement instance of its logical form is false. (This\nidea is only rejected by those who reject the notion of logical form.)\nIt is a common observation that this property, even if it is\nnecessary, is not clearly sufficient for a sentence to be a logical\ntruth. Perhaps there is a sentence that has this property but is not\nreally logically true, because one could assign some unexpressed\nmeanings to the variables and the schematic letters in its\nlogical form, and under those meanings the form would be a false\n sentence.[8]\n On the other hand, it is not clearly incorrect to think that a\nsentence is a logical truth if no collective assignment of meanings to\nthe variables and the schematic letters in its logical form would turn\nthis form into a false sentence. Say that a sentence is\nuniversally valid when it has this property. A standard\napproach to the mathematical characterization of logical truth,\nalternative to the derivability approach, uses always some version of\nthe property of universal validity, proposing it in each case as both\nnecessary and sufficient for logical truth. Note that if a sentence is\nuniversally valid then, even if it's not logically true, it will be\ntrue. So all universally valid sentences are correct at least\nin this sense. \n\nApparently, the first to use a version of universal validity and\nexplicitly propose it as both necessary and sufficient for logical\ntruth was Bolzano (see Bolzano 1837, §148; and Coffa 1991, pp.\n33–4 for the claim of priority). The idea is also present in other\nmathematicians of the nineteenth century (see e.g. Jané 2006),\nand was common in Hilbert's school. Tarski (1936a, 1936b) was the\nfirst to indicate in a fully explicit way how the version of universal\nvalidity used by the mathematicians could itself be given a\ncharacterization in terms of concepts of standard mathematics, in the\ncase of Fregean formalized languages with an algorithmic\ngrammar. Essentially Tarski's characterization is widely used today in\nthe form of what is known as the model-theoretic notion of\nvalidity, and it seems fair to say that it is usually accepted\nthat this notion gives a reasonably good delineation of the set of\nlogical truths for Fregean languages. \n\nThe notion of model-theoretic validity mimics the notion of universal\nvalidity, but is defined just with the help of the set-theoretic\napparatus developed by Tarski (1935) for the characterization of\nsemantic concepts such as satisfaction, definability, and truth.\n (See the entry on \n  Tarski's truth definitions.)\n Given a Fregean language, a structure for the language is a\nset-theoretical object composed of a set-domain taken together with an\nassignment of extensions drawn from that domain to its non-logical\nconstants. A structure is meant by most logicians to represent an\nassignment of meanings: its domain gives the range or “meaning” of the\nfirst-order variables (and induces ranges of the higher-order\nvariables), and the extensions that the structure assigns to the\nnon-logical constants are “meanings” that these expressions could\ntake. Using the Tarskian apparatus, one defines for the formulae of\nthe Fregean language the notion of truth in (or satisfaction by) a\nset-theoretic structure (with respect to an infinite sequence\nassigning an object of the domain to each variable).  And finally, one\ndefines a formula to be model-theoretically valid just in case it is\ntrue in all structures for its language (with respect to all infinite\nsequences). Let's abbreviate “\\(F\\) is true in all structures” as\n“MTValid\\((F)\\)”. The model-theoretic characterization makes it\nclear that “MTValid\\((F)\\)” is definable purely in terms of\nconcepts of set theory. (The notion of model-theoretic validity for\nFregean languages is explained in thorough detail in the entries on\n classical logic and\n second-order and higher-order logic;\n see also the entry on\n model theory.)[9] \n\n(If \\(F\\) is a formula of a first-order language without\nidentity, then if no replacement instance of the form of \\(F\\) is\nfalse, this is a sufficient condition for \\(F\\)'s being\nmodel-theoretically valid.  As it turns out, if \\(F\\) is not\nmodel-theoretically valid, then some replacement instance of its form\nwhose variables range over the natural numbers and whose non-logical\nconstants are arithmetical expressions will be false. This can be\njustified by means of a refinement of the Löwenheim-Skolem\ntheorem.\n See the entry on logic, classical,\n and Quine 1970, ch. 4, for discussion and references. No similar\nresults hold for higher-order languages.) \n\nThe “MT” in “MTValid\\((F)\\)” stresses the fact that\nmodel-theoretic validity is different from universal validity. The\nnotion of a meaning assignment which appears in the description of\nuniversal validity is a very imprecise and intuitive notion, while the\nnotion of a structure appearing in a characterization of\nmodel-theoretic validity is a fairly precise and technical one. It\nseems clear that the notion of a structure for Fregean formalized\nlanguages is minimally reasonable, in the sense that a structure\nmodels the power of one or several meaning assignments to make false\n(the logical form of) some sentence. As we will mention later, the\nconverse property, that each meaning assignment's validity-refuting\npower is modeled by some structure, is also a natural but more\ndemanding requirement on a notion of structure. \n\nThe fact that the notions of derivability and model-theoretic validity\nare definable in standard mathematics seems to have been a very\nattractive feature of them among practicing logicians. But this\nattractive feature of course does not justify by itself taking either\nnotion as an adequate characterization of logical truth. On most\nviews, with a mathematical characterization of logical truth we\nattempt to delineate a set of formulae possessing a number of\nnon-mathematical properties.  Which properties these are varies\ndepending on our pretheoretic conception of, for example, the features\nof modality and formality. (By “pretheoretic” it's not\nmeant “previous to any theoretical activity”; there could\nhardly be a “pretheoretic” conception of logical truth in\nthis sense. In this context what's meant is “previous to the\ntheoretical activity of mathematical characterization”.) But on\nany such conception there will be external, non-mathematical criteria\nthat can be applied to evaluate the question whether a mathematical\ncharacterization is adequate. In this last section we will outline\nsome of the basic issues and results on the question whether\nderivability and model-theoretic validity are adequate in this\nsense. \n\nOne frequent objection to the adequacy of model-theoretic validity is\nthat it does not provide a conceptual analysis of the notion of\nlogical truth, even for sentences of Fregean formalized languages (see\ne.g. Pap 1958, p. 159; Kneale and Kneale 1962, p. 642; Field 1989,\npp. 33–4; Etchemendy 1990, ch. 7). This complaint is especially\ncommon among authors who feel inclined to identify logical truth and\nanalyticity\nsimpliciter (see e.g. Kneale and Kneale, ibid.,\nEtchemendy 1990, p. 126). If one thinks of the concept of logical\ntruth simply as the concept of analytic truth, it is especially\nreasonable to accept that the concept of logical truth does not have\nmuch to do with the concept of model-theoretic validity, for\npresumably this concept does not have much to do with the concept of\nanalyticity. To say that a formula is model-theoretically valid means\nthat there are no set-theoretic structures in which it is false;\nhence, to say that a formula is not model-theoretically valid means\nthat there are set-theoretic structures in which it is false. But to\nsay that a sentence is or is not analytic presumably does not mean\nanything about the existence or non-existence of set-theoretic\nstructures. Note that we could object to derivability on the same\ngrounds, for to say that a sentence is or is not analytic presumably\ndoes not mean anything about its being or not being the product of a\ncertain algorithm (compare Etchemendy 1990, p. 3). (One further\npeculiar, much debated claim in Etchemendy 1990 is that true claims of\nthe form “\\(F\\) is logically true” or\n“\\(F\\) is not logically true” should themselves be\nlogical truths (while the corresponding claims\n“MTValid\\((F)\\)” and “Not\nMTValid\\((F)\\)” are not logical truths). Etchemendy's claim\nis perhaps defensible under a conception of logical truth as\nanalyticity\nsimpliciter, but certainly doubtful on more traditional\nconceptions of logical truth, on which the predicate “is a logical\ntruth” is not even a logical expression. See Gómez-Torrente\n1998/9 and Soames 1999, ch. 4 for discussion.) \n\nAnalogous “no conceptual analysis” objections can be made\nif we accept that the concept of logical truth has some other strong\nmodal notes unrelated to analyticity; for example, if we accept that\nit is part of the concept of logical truth that logical truths are\ntrue in all counterfactual circumstances, or necessary in some other\nstrong sense. Sher (1996) accepts something like the requirement that\na good characterization of logical truth should be given in terms of a\nmodally rich concept. However, she argues that the notion of\nmodel-theoretic validity is strongly modal, and so the “no\nconceptual analysis” objection is actually wrong: to say that a\nformula is or is not model-theoretically valid is to make a\nmathematical existence or non-existence claim, and according to Sher\nthese claims are best read as claims about the possibility and\nnecessity of structures. (Shalkowski 2004 argues that Sher's defense\nof model-theoretic validity is insufficient, on the basis of a certain\nmetaphysical conception of logical necessity. Etchemendy 2008\nrelatedly argues that Sher's defense is based on inadequate\nrestrictions on the modality relevant to logical truth. See also the\ncritical discussion of Sher in Hanson 1997.)  García-Carpintero\n(1993) offers a view related to Sher's: model-theoretic validity\nprovides a (correct) conceptual analysis of logical truth for Fregean\nlanguages, because the notion of a set-theoretical structure is in\nfact a subtle refinement of the modal notion of a possible meaning\nassignment. Azzouni (2006), ch. 9, also defends the view that\nmodel-theoretic validity provides a correct conceptual analysis of\nlogical truth (though restricted to first-order languages), on the\nbasis of a certain deflationist conception of the (strong) modality\ninvolved in logical truth. \n\nThe standard view of set-theoretic claims, however, does not see them\nas strong modal claims—at best, some of them are modal in the\nminimal sense that they are universal generalizations or particular\ncases of these. But it is at any rate unclear that this is the basis\nfor a powerful objection to model-theoretic validity or to\nderivability, for, even if we accept that the concept of logical truth\nis strongly modal, it is unclear that a good characterization of\nlogical truth ought to be a conceptual analysis. An analogy might\nhelp.  It is widely agreed that the characterizations of the notion of\ncomputability in standard mathematics, e.g. as recursiveness, are in\nsome sense good characterizations. Note that the concept of\ncomputability is modal, in a moderately strong sense; it\nseems to be about what a being like us could do with certain symbols\nif he were free from certain limitations—not about, say, what\nexisting beings have done or will do. However, to say that a certain\nfunction is recursive is not to make a modal claim about it, but a\ncertain purely arithmetical claim. So recursiveness is widely agreed\nto provide a good characterization of computability, but it clearly\ndoes not provide a conceptual analysis. Perhaps it could be argued\nthat the situation with model-theoretic validity, or derivability, or\nboth, is the same. \n\nA number of philosophers explicitly reject the requirement that a good\ncharacterization of logical truth should provide a conceptual\nanalysis, and (at least for the sake of argument) do not question the\nusual view of set-theoretic claims as non-modal, but have argued that\nthe universe of set-theoretic structures somehow models the universe\nof possible structures (or at least the universe of possible\nset-theoretic structures; see McGee 1992, Shapiro 1998, Sagi 2014). In this\nindirect sense, the characterization in terms of model-theoretic\nvalidity would grasp part of the strong modal force that logical\ntruths are often perceived to possess. McGee (1992) gives an elegant\nargument for this idea: it is reasonable to think that given any\nset-theoretic structure, even one construed out of non-mathematical\nindividuals, actualized or not, there is a set-theoretic structure\nisomorphic to it but construed exclusively out of pure sets; but any\nsuch pure set-theoretic structure is, on the usual view, an actualized\nexistent; so every possible set-theoretic structure is modeled by a\nset-theoretic structure, as desired. (The significance of this relies\non the fact that in Fregean languages a formula is true in a structure\nif and only if it is true in all the structures isomorphic to it.) \n\nBut model-theoretic validity (or derivability) might be theoretically\nadequate in some way even if some possible meaning-assignments are not\nmodeled straightforwardly by (actual) set-theoretic structures. For\nmodel-theoretic validity to be theoretically adequate, it might be\nheld, it is enough if we have other reasons to think that it is\nextensionally adequate, i.e.  that it coincides in extension with our\npreferred pretheoretic notion of logical truth. In subsections 2.4.2\nand 2.4.3 we will examine some existing arguments for and against the\nplain extensional adequacy of derivability and model-theoretic\nvalidity for Fregean languages. \n\nIf one builds one's deductive calculus with care, one will be able\nto convince oneself that all the formulae derivable in the calculus are\nlogical truths. The reason is that one can have used one's intuition\nvery systematically to obtain that conviction: one can have included in\none's calculus only axioms of which one is convinced that they are\nlogical truths; and one can have included as rules of inference rules\nof which one is convinced that they produce logical truths when applied\nto logical truths. Using another terminology, this means that, if one\nbuilds one's calculus with care, one will be convinced that the\nderivability characterization of logical truth for formulae of the\nformalized language will be sound with respect to logical\ntruth. \n\nIt is equally obvious that if one has at hand a notion of\nmodel-theoretic validity for a formalized language which is based on a\nminimally reasonable notion of structure, then all logical truths (of\nthat language) will be model-theoretically valid. The reason is simple:\nif a formula is not model-theoretically valid then there is a structure\nin which it is false; but this structure must then model a meaning\nassignment (or assignments) on which the formula (or its logical form)\nis false; so it will be possible to construct a formula\nwith the same logical form, whose non-logical expressions have,\nby stipulation, the particular meanings drawn from that collective\nmeaning assignment, and which is therefore false. But then the idea of\nformality and the weakest conception of the modal force of logical\ntruths uncontroversially imply that the original formula is not\nlogically true. Using another terminology, we can conclude that\nmodel-theoretic validity is complete with respect to logical\ntruth. \n\nLet's abbreviate “\\(F\\) is derivable in\ncalculus \\(C\\)” by “DC\\((F)\\)” and\n“\\(F\\) is a logical truth (in our preferred pretheoretical\nsense)” by “LT\\((F)\\)”. Then, if \\(C\\) is\na calculus built to suit our pretheoretic conception of logical truth,\nthe situation can be summarized thus: \n\nThe first implication is the soundness of derivability; the second\nis the completeness of model-theoretic validity. \n\nIn order to convince ourselves that the characterizations of logical\ntruth in terms of DC\\((F)\\) and MTValid\\((F)\\) are\nextensionally adequate we should convince ourselves that the converse\nimplications hold too: \n\nObtaining this conviction, or the conviction that these implications\ndon't in fact hold, turns out to be difficult in general. But a remark\nof Kreisel (1967) establishes that a conviction that they hold can be\nobtained sometimes. In some cases it is possible to give a\nmathematical proof that derivability (in some specified calculus\n\\(C\\)) is complete with respect to model-theoretic validity,\ni.e. a proof of \n\nKreisel called attention to the fact that (6) together with (4)\nimplies that model-theoretic validity is sound with respect to logical\ntruth, i.e., that the first implication of (5) holds. (Strictly\nspeaking, this is a strong generalization of Kreisel's remark, which\nin place of “\\(\\text{LT}(F)\\)” had something like\n“\\(F\\) is true in all class structures”\n(structures with a class, possibly proper, as domain of the individual\nvariables).) This means that when (6) holds the notion of\nmodel-theoretic validity offers an extensionally correct\ncharacterization of logical truth. (See Etchemendy 1990, ch. 11,\nHanson 1997, Gómez-Torrente 1998/9, and Field 2008, ch. 2, for\nversions of this observation, and Smith 2011 and Griffiths 2014 for objections.) Also,\n(6), together with (4), implies that the notion of derivability is\ncomplete with respect to logical truth (the second implication in (5))\nand hence offers an extensionally correct characterization of this\nnotion. Note that this reasoning is very general and independent of\nwhat our particular pretheoretic conception of logical truth is. \n\nAn especially significant case in which this reasoning can be applied\nis the case of first-order quantificational languages, under a wide\narray of pretheoretic conceptions of logical truth. It is typical to\naccept that all formulae derivable in a typical first-order calculus\nare universally valid, true in all counterfactual circumstances, a\npriori and analytic if any formula\n is.[10] \nSo (4) holds under a wide array of pretheoretic conceptions in this\ncase. (6) holds too for the typical calculi in question, in virtue of\nGödel's completeness theorem, so (5) holds. This means that one\ncan convince oneself that both derivability and model-theoretic\nvalidity are extensionally correct characterizations of our favorite\npretheoretic notion of logical truth for first-order languages, if our\npretheoretic conception is not too eccentric. The situation is not so\nclear in other languages of special importance for the Fregean\ntradition, the higher-order quantificational languages. \n\nIt follows from Gödel's first incompleteness theorem that already\nfor a second-order language there is no calculus \\(C\\) where\nderivability is sound with respect to model-theoretic validity and\nwhich makes true (6) (for the notion of model-theoretic validity as\nusually defined for such a language). We may call this result the\nincompleteness of second-order calculi with respect to model-theoretic\nvalidity. Said another way: for every second-order calculus\n\\(C\\) sound with respect to model-theoretic validity there will\nbe a formula \\(F\\) such that \\(\\text{MTValid}(F)\\) but it is not\nthe case that \\(\\text{DC}(F)\\). \n\nIn this situation it's not possible to apply Kreisel's argument for\n(5). In fact, the incompleteness of second-order calculi shows that,\ngiven any calculus \\(C\\) satisfying (4), one of the implications\nof (5) is false (or both are): either derivability\nin \\(C\\) is incomplete with respect to logical truth or\nmodel-theoretic validity is unsound with respect to logical truth. \n\nDifferent authors have extracted opposed lessons from\nincompleteness. A common reaction is to think that model-theoretic\nvalidity must be unsound with respect to logical truth. This is\nespecially frequent in philosophers on whose conception logical truths\nmust be a priori or analytic. One idea is that the results of\na priori reasoning or of analytic thinking ought to be\ncodifiable in a calculus. (See e.g. Wagner 1987, p. 8.) But even if we\ngrant this idea, it's doubtful that the desired conclusion follows.\nSuppose that (i) every a priori or analytic reasoning must be\nreproducible in a calculus. We accept also, of course, that (ii)\nfor every calculus \\(C\\) sound with respect to\nmodel-theoretic validity there is a\nmodel-theoretically valid formula that is not derivable in\n\\(C\\).  From all this it doesn't follow that (iii) there\nis a model-theoretically valid formula \\(F\\) such that\nfor every calculus \\(C\\) sound for model-theoretic\nvalidity \\(F\\) is not derivable in C.  From (iii) and\n(i) it follows of course that there are model-theoretically valid\nformulae that are not obtainable by a priori or analytic\nreasoning. But the step from (ii) to (iii) is a typical\nquantificational fallacy. From (i) and (ii) it doesn't follow that\nthere is any model-theoretically valid formula which is not obtainable\nby a priori or analytic reasoning. The only thing that\nfollows (from (ii) alone under the assumptions that model-theoretic\nvalidity is sound with respect to logical truth and that logical\ntruths are a priori and analytic) is that no calculus sound\nwith respect to model-theoretic validity can by itself model\nall the a priori or analytic reasonings\nthat people are able to make. But it's not sufficiently clear that\nthis should be intrinsically problematic. After all, a priori\nand analytic reasonings must start from basic axioms and rules, and\nfor all we know a reflective mind may have an inexhaustible ability to\nfind new truths and truth-preserving rules by a priori or\nanalytic consideration of even a meager stock of concepts. The claim\nthat all analytic truths ought to be derivable in one single calculus\nis perhaps plausible on the view that analyticity is to be explained\nby conventions or “tacit agreements”, for these agreements are\npresumably finite in number, and their implications are presumably at\nmost effectively enumerable. But this view is just one problematic\nidea about how apriority and analyticity should be explicated. (See\nalso Etchemendy (1990), chs.  8, 9, for an argument for the\nunsoundness of higher-order model-theoretic validity based on the\nconception of logical truth as analyticity simpliciter, and\nGómez-Torrente (1998/9), Soames (1999), ch. 4, and Paseau (2014) for critical\nreactions.) \n\nAnother type of unsoundness arguments attempt to show that there is\nsome higher-order formula that is model-theoretically valid but is\nintuitively false in a structure whose domain is a proper class. (The\n“intended interpretation” of set theory, if it exists at all, might be\none such structure, for it is certainly not a set; see the entry on\n set theory.) These arguments thus\n question the claim that each meaning assignment's validity-refuting\npower is modeled by some set-theoretic structure, a claim which is\nsurely a corollary of the first implication in (5). (In McGee 1992\nthere is a good example; there is critical discussion in\nGómez-Torrente 1998/9.) The most widespread view among set\ntheorists seems to be that there are no formulae with that property in\nFregean languages, but it's certainly not an absolutely firm belief of\ntheirs. Note that these arguments offer a challenge only to the idea\nthat universal validity (as defined in section 2.3) is adequately\nmodeled by set-theoretic validity, not to the soundness of a\ncharacterization of logical truth in terms of universal validity\nitself, or in terms of a species of validity based on some notion of\n“meaning assignment” different from the usual notion of a\nset-theoretic structure. (The arguments we mentioned in the preceding\nparagraph and in 2.4.1 would have deeper implications if correct, for\nthey easily imply challenges to all characterizations in terms of\nspecies of validity as well). In fact, worries of this kind have\nprompted the proposal of a different kind of notions of validity (for\nFregean languages), in which set-theoretic structures are replaced\nwith suitable values of higher-order variables in a higher-order\nlanguage for set theory, e.g. with “plural interpretations” (see\nBoolos 1985, Rayo and Uzquiano 1999, Williamson 2003; see also the\nentry on\n plural quantification).\n Both set-theoretic and proper class structures are modeled by such\nvalues, so these particular worries of unsoundness do not\naffect this kind of proposals. \n\nIn general, there are no fully satisfactory philosophical arguments\nfor the thesis that model-theoretic validity is unsound with respect\nto logical truth in higher-order languages. Are there then any good\nreasons to think that derivability (in any calculus sound for\nmodel-theoretic validity) must be incomplete with respect to logical\ntruth? There don't seem to be any absolutely convincing reasons for\nthis view either.  The main argument (the first version of which was\nperhaps first made explicit in Tarski 1936a, 1936b) seems to be\nthis. As noted above, Gödel's first incompleteness theorem\nimplies that for any calculus for a higher-order language there will\nbe a model-theoretically valid formula that will not be derivable in\nthe calculus. As it turns out, the formula obtained by the Gödel\nconstruction is also always intuitively true in all domains\n(set-theoretical or not), and it's reasonable to think of it as\nuniversally valid. (It's certainly not a formula false in a proper\nclass structure.) The argument concludes that for any calculus there\nare logically true formulae that are not derivable in it. \n\nFrom this it has been concluded that derivability (in any calculus)\nmust be incomplete with respect to logical truth. But a fundamental\nproblem is that this conclusion is based on two assumptions that will\nnot necessarily be granted by the champion of derivability: first, the\nassumption that the expressions typically cataloged as logical in\nhigher-order languages, and in particular the quantifiers in\nquantifications of the form \\(\\forall X\\) (where \\(X\\) is a\nhigher-order variable), are in fact logical expressions; and second,\nthe assumption that being universally valid is a sufficient condition\nfor logical truth. On these assumptions it is certainly very\nreasonable to think that derivability, in any calculus satisfying (4),\nmust be incomplete with respect to logical truth. But in the absence\nof additional considerations, a critic may question the assumptions,\nand deny relevance to the argument. The second assumption would\nprobably be questioned e.g. from the point of view that logical truths\nmust be analytic, for there is no conclusive reason to think that\nuniversally valid formulae must be analytic. The first assumption\nactually underlies any conviction one may have that (4) holds for any\none particular higher-order calculus.  (Note that if we denied that\nthe higher-order quantifiers are logical expressions we could equally\ndeny that the arguments presented above against the soundness of\nmodel-theoretic validity with respect to logical truth are\nrelevant at all.)  That the higher-order quantifiers are logical has\noften been denied on the grounds that they are semantically too\n“substantive”. It is often pointed out in this connection that\nhigher-order quantifications can be used to define sophisticated\nset-theoretic properties that one cannot define just with the help of\nfirst-order quantifiers. (Defenders of the logical status of\nhigher-order quantifications, on the other hand, point to the wide\napplicability of the higher-order quantifiers, to the fact that they\nare analogous to the first-order quantifiers, to the fact that they\nare typically needed to provide categorical axiomatizations of\nmathematical structures, etc. See Quine (1970), ch.  5, for the\nstandard exponent of the restrictive view, and Boolos (1975) and\nShapiro (1991) for standard exponents of the liberal view.)\n","contact.mail":"mariogt@unam.mx","contact.domain":"unam.mx"}]
