Although there is some overlap, these lists are often\ndifferent, depending upon the interests of the authors. Each attempt\nat a definition are inextricably linked to a theory from which it\nderives its meaning (Benner 2010).  Some biologists and philosophers\neven reject the whole idea of there being a need for a definition,\nsince life for them is an irreducible fact about the natural\nworld. Others see life simply as that which biologists study.  There\nhave been three main philosophical approaches to the problem of\ndefining life that remain relevant today: Aristotle's view of life as\nanimation, a fundamental, irreducible property of nature; Descartes's\nview of life as mechanism; and Kant's view of life as organization, to\nwhich we need to add Darwin's concept of variation and evolution\nthrough natural selection (Gayon 2010; Morange 2008).  In addition we\nmay add the idea of defining life as an emergent property of\nparticular kinds of complex systems (Weber 2010).\n\n\n\nThe focus of this entry is primarily the attempts to define life\nduring the twentieth century with the rise of biochemistry and\nmolecular biology. But this was the century that saw the rise of\nartificial intelligence, artificial life, and complex systems theory\nand so the concern includes these perspectives. Animate beings share a\nrange of properties and phenomena that are not seen together in\ninanimate matter, although examples of matter exhibiting one or the\nother of these can be found. Living entities metabolize, grow, die,\nreproduce, respond, move, have complex organized functional\nstructures, heritable variability, and have lineages which can evolve\nover generational time, producing new and emergent functional\nstructures that provide increased adaptive fitness in changing\nenvironments.  Reproduction involves not only the replication of the\nnucleic acids that carry the genetic information but the epigenetic\nbuilding of the organism through a sequence of developmental\nsteps. Such reproduction through development occurs within a larger\nlife-cycle of the organism, which includes its senescence and\ndeath. Something that is alive has organized, complex structures that\ncarry out these functions as well as sensing and responding to\ninterior states and to the external environment and engaging in\nmovement within that environment. It must be remembered that\nevolutionary phenomena are an inextricable aspect of living systems;\nany attempt to define life in the absence of this diachronic\nperspective will be futile. It will be argued below that living\nsystems may be defined as open systems maintained in steady-states,\nfar-from-equilibrium, due to matter-energy flows in which informed\n(genetically) autocatalytic cycles extract energy, build complex\ninternal structures, allowing growth even as they create greater\nentropy in their environments, and capable, over multigenerational\ntime. of evolution.\n\n\n\nThe last words written by Shelley in his unfinished poem The\nTriumph of Life were “Then, what is life? I cried.” Clearly\nShelley meant this in the everyday sense rather than the technical\nusage of what distinguishes animate from inanimate. C.U.M Smith (1976)\nin his The Problem of Life sets out to answer Shelley's\nquestion by addressing the problem not only of how matter could be\nalive but also be conscious. Although conscious, living matter was a\nproblem for Democritean philosophers, it was not for other\npre-Socratics nor for Aristotle for whom living beings where\nparadigmatic. “The phenomenon which seemed to [Aristotle] most\nbasic in the apparent flux of the world was the unity and persistence\nof the individual living being” (Smith 1976, p. 72). Indeed,\nAristotle's biology and the philosophy he developed from it was\nsophisticated and enduring (Lennox 2001). Thus for Aristotle there was\nno problem of life, although there was a problem for an atomist view of\nnature that seemed inconsistent with biological phenomena (Rosen 1991).\nDescartes radically reconceptualized the problem by his dualism of\nmatter and mind; life was a problem for which an explanation was to be\nsought in the mechanistic interactions of matter, and there was the\nquestion of how mind was related to the matter in living beings. As\nchemistry developed as a discipline in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies the goal of most advanced thinkers was to develop explanatory\ntheories of living things in terms of chemical matter and mechanisms.\nSuch attempts at what must be admitted to be premature reduction were\nresisted by critics, including some vitalists, whose positions covered\na wide range from romantic anti-materialists, through chemists seeking\na new type of Newtonian force (“vital force”) in nature, to\nmaterialists who had an intuition of the importance of the organized\nwhole (Fruton 1972, 1999). \n\nThe debate between the “mechanists” and the\n“vitalists” about the relationship of matter and life as\nwell as matter and mind, spilled over into the twentieth century,\nespecially during the time that biochemists were defining their field\nas a separate discipline from chemistry or physiology. Four books\npublished around 1930 capture the flavor of the debate (Woodger 1929;\nHaldane 1929, 1931; Hogben 1930). J.S. Haldane, a physiologist,\nresisted reduction of biological phenomena to mechanistic explanations,\nas he saw the structure of biological organisms and their action being\ndisanalogous to what was seen in physical systems. The laws of\nchemistry and physics just were not robust enough to account for\nbiology. “It is life we are studying in biology, and not\nphenomena which can be represented by causal conceptions of physics and\nchemistry” Haldane 1931, p. 28). He rejects, however, the search\nfor a vital force since it would reduce the complexity of biological\nphenomena to a single principle. Rather, the phenomena of biology can\nonly be understood in a holistic perspective that is faithful to the\ncomplexity observed in biological phenomena. Lancelot Hogben, in his\nbook The Nature of Living Matter, which was dedicated to\nBertrand Russell, argues for a reductionist epistemology and ontology.\nFor Hogben, as for Haldane, consciousness is seen as an integral part\nof the problem of life, “an inquiry into the nature of life and\nthe nature of consciousness presupposes the necessity of formulating\nthe problem in the right way” (Hogben 1930, pp. 31–32). Indeed,\n“no problem of philosophy is more fundamental than the nature of\nlife” (Hogben 1930, p. 80). But for Hogben the nature, indeed\nglory, of science is that its answers are always incomplete and it does\nnot seek the finality that he saw as the goal of philosophy. He saw no\nneed to abandon the reductionist methodology that biochemistry was\ndeveloping and argued that Whitehead's assumption that science would\nreveal a universe consistent with human ethical predilections should be\nreversed and that philosophy would have to conform with the findings of\nscience. Woodger saw the issues in the mechanist-vitalist debate as\nmore complex than either side admitted. The resolution would come from\na recognition of the primary importance of biological organization and\nof levels of biological organization, “by a cell therefore I\nshall understand a certain type of biological organization, not a\nconcrete entity” (Woodger 1929, p. 296, emphasis in original).\nWoodger urged abandoning the use of the word ‘life’ in\nscientific discourse on the grounds that ‘living organism’\nwas what had to be explained. He saw the question of how life arose as\nbeing outside science. \n\nPerhaps the venue where the issue of the nature of life was most\nurgently addressed was the Department of Biochemistry at the University\nof Cambridge. During the first half of the twentieth century, under the\nguidance of its first Sir William Dunn Professor of Biochemistry, Sir\nFrederick Gowland Hopkins, the department set much of the conceptual\nframework, methodology, as well as educating many of the leaders in the\nfield (Needham & Baldwin 1949; Weatherall and Kamminga 1992;\nKamminga & Weatherall 1996; Weatherall & Kamminga 1996;\nKamminga 1997; de Chadarevian 2002). Hopkins's vision of the emerging\nfield of biochemistry was that it was a discipline in its own right\n(not an adjunct to medicine or agriculture nor applied chemistry) that\nneeded to explore all biological phenomena on the chemical level. More\nimportantly, Hopkins had a belief that although living things did not\ndisobey any physical or chemical laws they instantiated them in ways\nthat required understanding of biological phenomena, constraints, and\nfunctional organization. In his influential address to the British\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science given in 1913, Hopkins\nrejected both the reductionism of organic chemists who sought to deduce\nin vitro what had to happen in vivo and the crypto-vitalism of many\nphysiologists who viewed the protoplasm of living cells as itself alive\nand irreducible to chemical analysis (Hopkins 1913 [1949]). What\nHopkins offered instead was a view of the cell as a chemical machine,\nobeying the laws of thermodynamics and physical chemistry generally,\nbut having organized molecular structures and functions. The chemistry\nunderlying metabolism was catalyzed and regulated by enzymes, protein\ncatalysts, and involved, because of biological necessity, small changes\nin structure and energy of well-defined chemical intermediates. The\nliving cell is “not a mass of matter composed of a congregation\nof like molecules, but a highly differentialed system: the cell, in the\nmodern phraseology of physical chemistry, is a system of co-existing\nphases of different constitutions” (Hopkins 1913 [1949] p. 151).\nUnderstanding how the organization was achieved was just as important\nas knowing how the chemical reactions occurred. For Hopkins life is\n“a property of the cell as a whole, because it depends upon the\norganization of processes” (Hopkins 1913 [1949] p. 152). Indeed,\nHopkins was impressed with the philosophy of Whitehead with its\npart/whole relationships and emphasis on processes rather than entities\n(Hopkins 1927 [1949]; Kamminga & Weatherall 1996) and it formed an\nexplicit foundation for the research program he developed at Cambridge\nand became an implicit assumption in the research programs developed by\nmany of the students who trained there (Prebble & Weber 2003). A\nmember of the department, Joseph Needham became actively engaged in\ncarrying Hopkins's vision to the broader intellectual community writing\non the philosophical basis of biochemistry (Needham 1925). He followed\nHopkins too in asserting that the crucial question no longer was the\nrelationship of living and non-living substance but also of mind and body,\nwith biochemistry conceding to philosophy and the then incipient\nneurosciences, the latter question, so that it could focus on learning\nabout living matter. Another member of the biochemistry department,\nN.W. Pirie, tackled the question of defining life and concluded that it\ncould not be adequately defined by a list of qualities nor even\nprocesses since life “cannot be defined in terms of one\nvariable” (Pirie 1937, p. 21–22). There was a challenge for\nHopkins's program to figure out how rather simple physical and chemical\nlaws could produce the complexity of living systems.  \n\nDuring the 1930s an informal group, known as the Biotheoretical\nGathering met in Cambridge and included several members of the\nbiochemistry department (Joseph & Dorothy Needham, and Conrad\nWaddington) as well as a number of other Cambridge scientists (such as\ncrystallographers J.D. Bernal and Dorothy Crowford Hodgkins) and\nphilosophers (J.H. Woodger and Karl Popper). This group was consciously\nexploring the philosophical approach of Whitehead with the goal of\nbuilding a trans-disciplinary theoretical and philosophical biology\nwhich helped lay the foundation for the conceptual triumph of molecular\nbiology after World War II (Abir-Am 1987; de Chadarevian 2002). The\nresearch program of Hopkins was well established by this period and\nespecially through the Needhams it was linked with the work of the\nBiotheoretical Gathering, influencing J.B.S. Haldane, who made major\ncontributions to enzymology and to forging the modern evolutionary\nsynthesis or neo-Darwinism. Haldane, along with Bernal, would play a\nmajor, early role in moving the concern from beyond the nature of life\nto its origin as a subject for scientific study. Haldane suspected,\nalong with Pirie, that a fully satisfactory definition of life was\nimpossible, but he asserted that the material definition was a\nreasonable goal for science. He saw life as “a pattern of\nchemical processes. This pattern has special properties. It begets a\nsimilar pattern, as a flame does, but it regulates itself as a flame\ndoes not.” (Haldane 1947, p. 56). Use of the flame metaphor for\ncellular metabolic activity implied a nonequilibrium process in an open\nsystem capable of reproduction but also, by the limit of the metaphor,\nself regulation. In this Haldane reflected the shifting concern to\nworking out how matter and physical laws could lead to biological\nphenomena. \n\nBy the time of World War II it was meaningful to address the question\nof “what is life?” in molecular terms and fundamental\nphysical laws. It was clear that there were several distinct ways in\nwhich matter in living systems behaved in ways different from\nnon-living systems. For example, how could genetic information be\ninstantiated at a molecular level given that ensembles of atoms or\nmolecules behaved statistically? Or, how could biological systems\ngenerate and maintain their internal order in the face of the\nimperative of the second law of thermodynamics that all natural\nsystems proceed with increasing entropy? \n\nIn 1943 Erwin Schrödinger gave a series of lectures at the Dublin\nInstitute for Advanced Studies, which were published as What is\nLife? in 1944 (Schrödinger 1944). This little book had a major\nimpact on the development of twentieth century biology, especially upon\nFrancis Crick and James Watson and other founders of molecular biology\n(Judson 1979; Murphy & O'Neill 1995). Schrödinger did not break\nnew ground, as has been pointed out by Perutz (1987), but rather\ngathered together several strands of research and stated his questions\nin a stark and provocative manner. Building upon the demonstration by\nMax Delbrueck that the size of the ‘target’ of mutations\ncaused by X-rays had the dimensions of a molecule of a thousand or so\natoms, Schrödinger wondered how it could be that there could be\nsustained order in the molecules responsible for heredity when it was\nwell known that statistical ensembles of molecules quickly became\ndisordered (with increased entropy as predicted by the second law of\nthermodynamics). The problem of heredity then was reformulated at the\nmolecular level as to how order could give rise to order? The other\nmain topic that concerned Schrödinger was the thermodynamics of living\nthings in general, that is, how could they generate order from disorder\nthrough their metabolism? It was through answering these two specific\nquestions from the perspective of a physicist that Schrödinger sought\nto answer the big question, what is life?  \n\nIt was the answer to the first question that captured the attention\nof the founders of the new biology. Schrödinger argued that the\nmolecular material had to be an ‘aperiodic’ solid that had\nembedded in its structure a ‘miniature code.’ That is, the\npattern of constituent atoms comprising the molecule of heredity would\nnot have a simple periodic repetitive order of the same constituents or\nsubunits, but rather would have a higher-level order due to the pattern\nof its molecular subunits; it was this higher-level but aperiodic order\nthat would contain the coded information of heredity. The elucidation\nof the structure of DNA and the explosion of our understanding of\nmolecular genetics has eclipsed the other, but to Schrödinger equal,\narm of the argument, namely that the most important aspect of\nmetabolism is that it represents the cell's way of dealing with all the\nentropy that it cannot help but produce as it builds its internal\norder, what Schrödinger termed ‘negentropy.’ He noted that\nthe cell must maintain itself in a state away from equilibrium since\nthermodynamic equilibrium is the very definition of death. By creating\ninternal order and organization within a living system (cells,\norganisms or ecosystems) the metabolic activities must produce greater\ndisorder in the environment, such that the second law is not violated.\nHe tied the two notions, of order from order and order from disorder,\ntogether by claiming, “an organism's astonishing gift of\nconcentrating a ‘stream of order’ on itself and thus\nescaping the decay into atomic chaos — of ‘drinking\norderliness’ from a suitable environment — seems to be\nconnected with the presence of ‘aperiodic solids’, the\nchromosome molecules, which doubtless represent the highest degree of\nwell-ordered atomic association we know of — much higher than the\nordinary periodic crystal — in virtue of the individual role\nevery atom and every radical is playing here” (Schrödinger 1944,\n77). Although Schrödinger was giving a physicist's answer to Shelley's\nquestion, he did not confine himself only to the question of what\ndistinguished the living from the non-living and in the epilogue\nreflects on free will and consciousness. As with so many previous\nattempts to address the nature of life, the issue of consciousness was\nseen by Schrödinger too as connected to that of life itself. \n\nThe impact of Schrödinger's slim volume on a generation of\nphysicists and chemists who were lured to biology and who founded\nmolecular biology is well chronicled (Judson 1979; Kay\n2000). Knowledge about the protein and nucleic acid basis of living\nsystems continues to be obtained at an accelerating rate, with the\nsequencing of the human genome as a major landmark along this path of\ndiscovery. The “self-replicating” DNA has become a major\nmetaphor for understanding all of life. The world is divided into\nreplicators, which are seen to be fundamental and to control\ndevelopment and be the fundamental level of action for natural\nselection, and interactors, the molecules and structures coded by the\nreplicators (Dawkins 1976, 1989). Indeed, Dawkins relegates organisms\nto the status of epiphenomenal gene-vehicles, or survival machines. A\nreaction has set in to what is perceived as an over-emphasis on\nnucleic acid replication (see for example Keller 1995, 2002; Moss\n2003). In particular developmental systems theorists have argued for a\ncausal pluralism in developmental and evolutionary biology (see essays\nand references in Oyama, Griffiths, & Gray 2001). However, the\nrapid progress in gene sequencing is producing fundamental insights\ninto the relationship of genes and morphology and has added important\ndimensions to our understanding of evolutionary phenomena (see for\nexample Graur & Li 2000; Carroll, Grenier, & Weatehrbee\n2001). \n\nWhat is less known is the over half-a-century of work inspired, in\npart, by the other pillar of Schrödinger's argument, namely how\norganisms gain order from disorder through the thermodynamics of open\nsystems far from equilibrium (Schneider & Kay 1995). Prominent\namong early students of such nonequilibrium thermodynamics was Ilya\nPrigogine (1947). Prigogine influenced J. D. Bernal in his 1947\nlectures on the physical basis of life to start to understand both how\norganisms produced their internal order while affected their\nenvironment by not only their activities but through created disorder\nin it (Bernal 1951). Harold Morowitz explicitly addressed the issue of\nenergy flow and the production of biological organization, subsequently\ngeneralized in various ways (Morowitz 1968; Peacocke 1983; Brooks and\nWiley 1986: Wicken 1987; Schneider 1993; Swenson 2000; Morowitz 2002).\nInternal order can be produced by gradients of energy (matter/energy)\nflows through living systems. Structures so produced help not only draw\nmore energy through the system, lengthen its retention time in the\nsystem, but also dissipate degraded energy, or entropy, to the\nenvironment, thus paying Schrödinger's “entropy debt.”\nLiving systems then are seen an instance of a more general phenomena of\ndissipative structures. “With the help of this energy and matter\nexchange with the environment, the system maintains its inner\nnon-equilibrium, and the non-equilibrium in turn maintains the exchange\nprocess…. A dissipative structure continuously renews itself and\nmaintains a particular dynamic regime, a globally stable space-time\nstructure” (Jantsch 1980). However, thermodynamics can deal only\nwith the possibility that something can occur spontaneously; whether\nself-organizing phenomena occur depend upon the actual specific\nconditions (initial and boundary) as well as the relationships among\ncomponents (Williams & Frausto da Silva 1999). \n\nSeeing the cell as a thermodynamic ‘dissipative structure’\nwas not to be considered as reducing the cell to physics, as Bernal\npointed out, rather a richer physics of what Warren Weaver called\n“organized complexity” (in contrast to simple order or\n“disorganized complexity”) was being deployed (Weaver\n1948). The development of this “new” physics of open\nsystems and the dissipative structures that arise in them was the\nfulfillment of the development that Schrödinger foresaw (Rosen 2000).\nDissipative structures in physical and chemical systems are phenomena\nthat are explained by nonequilibrium thermodynamics (Prigogine &\nStengers 1984). The emergent, self-organizing spatio-temporal patterns\nobserved in the Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction are also seen in\nbiological systems (such as in slime mold aggregation or electrical\npatterns in heart activity) (Tyson 1976; Sole and Goodwin 2000).\nIndeed, related self-organizational phenomena pervade biology\n(Camazine et al. 2001). Such phenomena are seen not only in cells and\norganisms, but in ecosystems, which reinforces the notion that a\nbroader systems perspective is needed as part of the new physics\n(Ulanowicz 1997).  Important to such phenomena are the dynamics of\nnon-linear interactions (where responses of a system can be much\nlarger than the stimulus) and autocatalytic cycles (reaction sequences\nthat are closed on themselves and in which a larger quantity of one or\nmore starting materials is made through the processes). Given that the\ncatalysts in biological systems are coded in the genes of the DNA, one\nplace to start defining life is to view living systems as informed,\nautocatalytic cyclic entities that develop and evolve under the dual\ndictates of the second law of thermodynamics and of natural selection\n(Depew & Weber 1995; Weber & Depew 1996). Such an approach\nnon-reductively connects the phenomena of living systems with basic\nlaws of physics and chemistry (Harold 2001).  Others intuit that an\neven richer physics is needed to adequately capture the\nself-organizing phenomena observed in biology and speculate that a\n“fourth law” of thermodynamics about such phenomena may\nultimately be needed (Kauffman 1993, 1995, 2000). In any event,\nincreasingly the tools developed for the “sciences of\ncomplexity” and being deployed to develop better models of\nliving systems (Depew & Weber 1995; Kauffman 2000). Robert Rosen\nhas reminded us that complexity is not life itself but what he terms\n“the habitat of life” and that we need to make our focus\non the relational. “Organization inherently involves functions\nand their interrelations” (Rosen 1991, 280). Whether the\nexisting sciences of complexity are sufficient or a newer conceptual\nframework is needed remains to be seen (Harold 2001). Living beings\nexhibit complex, functional organization and an ability to become more\nadapted to their environments over generational time, which phenomena\nrepresent the challenge to physically-based explanations based upon\nmechanistic (reductionistic) assumptions. By appealing to complex\nsystems dynamics there is the possibility of physically-based theories\nthat can robustly address phenomena of emergence without having\nrecourse to the type of “vitalism” that was countenanced\nby some in the earlier part of the twentieth century. \n\nOne of the biggest and most important of emergent phenomena is that of\nthe origin or emergence of life. Franklin Harold ranks the mystery of\nlife's origin as the most consequential facing science today (Harold\n2001, 235). Michael Ruse claims that it is essential to incorporate\norigin of life resarch into Darwinism since it is a necessary\ncondition for a scientifically and philosophically adequate definition\nof life (Ruse 2008, 101).  Robert Rosen argued that the reason that\nthe question “what is life?” is so hard to answer is that\nwe really want to know much more than what it is, we want to know why\nit is, “we are really asking, in physical terms, why a specific\nmaterial system is an organism and not something else” (Rosen\n1991, 15). To answer this why question we need to understand how life\nmight have arisen.  While not attracting the attention nor levels of\nfunding of molecular biology, there was a continuous research program\nduring much of the twentieth century on the origin of life (for\nhistorical summaries see Fry 2000; Lahav 1999).  \n\nDuring the 1920s Alexander Oparin and J.B.S. Haldane independently\nproposed the first modern hypotheses as to how life might have\noriginated on earth (Oparin 1929; Haldane 1929/1967). Key\nassumptions were that the geophysical conditions on the primitive earth\nwere quite different from the present, most importantly there would\nhave been no molecular oxygen in the atmosphere (oxygen arising very\nmuch later in time with the appearance of photosynthetic organisms that\nused light energy to split water) and that in this chemically reducing\natmosphere an increasingly complex “soup” or organic\nmolecules would arise from which the precursors of living systems could\narise (for a recent discussion about the early atmosphere see Miyakawa\net al. 2002). In effect this type of approach can be termed a\nmetabolism-first view. \n\nAfter the demonstration that some amino acids could be produced by\nthe action of an electrical discharge through a mixture of gases\nthought to be present in the primitive atmosphere (Miller 1953),\nanother possible starting point for the sequence to living things was\nconsidered, namely proteins, the polymers of amino acids formed under\nconditions of high temperature (Fox & Harada 1958). This\nprotein-first view suggested that the chemistry that lead to life could\nhave occurred in a sequestered environment (globs of proteins) that\nmight also have some weak catalytic activity that would have\nfacilitated the production of the other molecular components needed\n(Fox 1988). \n\nWith the understanding of the structure of DNA focus shifted to the\nabiotic routes to nucleic acids, which could serve then serve as\ntemplates for their own replication. Although Dawkins assumed a nucleic\nacid, formed by chance, would be the start of life since it would\n“self replicate” (Dawkins 1976), many approaches to getting\nto nucleic acids involve a role for minerals to help form scaffolds that\nserve as sorts of ordering templates and even as catalysts for nucleic\nacid formation (Cairns-Smith 1982; see summary in Lahav 1999). The\ndiscovery that RNA is capable of some catalytic activity has led to the\npostulate of not only a nucleic acids first but more generally of an\n‘RNA world’ (Gilbert 1986). Variants of this approach\nrepresent the dominant mode of thinking about the early phases of the\nemergence of life (Maynard Smith and Szathmary 1995). Given that some\ntype of metabolism would be needed to sustain RNA replication, a number\nof approaches blend replication-first with metabolism-first (Dyson\n1982, 1999; de Duve 1995; Eigen 1992). \n\nAn alternative view, congenial to a thermodynamic and systems approach\nto the emergence of life, takes the above move a step further and\nemphasizes the need the presence of the main factors that distinguish\ncells from non-cells: metabolism via autocatalytic cycles of catalytic\npolymers, replication, and a physical enclosure within a chemical\nbarrier like that provided by the cell membrane. This might be termed\na proto-cell-first approach (Morowitz 1992; Weber 1998; Williams &\nFrausto da Silva 2002, 2003). Chemical constraints and the\nself-organizing tendencies of complex chemical systems in such a view\nwould have been critical in determining the properties of the first\nliving beings. (Kauffman 1993, 1995, 2000; Williams & Frausto da\nSilva 1999, 2002, 2003; Weber 2007, 2009). With the emergence of the\nfirst entities that could be termed living would come the emergence of\nbiological selection or natural selection in which contingency plays a\nmuch greater part. \n\nDarwin famously bracketed the question of the origin of life from\nquestions of descent with modification through natural selection.\nIndeed, Darwinian theories of evolution can take living systems as a\ngiven and then explore how novelties arise through a combination of\nchance and necessity. However, an understanding of how life might have\nemerged would provide a bridge between our view of the properties of\nliving systems and the evolutionary phenomena they exhibit. Such an\nunderstanding ultimately is needed to anchor living systems in matter\nand the laws of nature (Harold 2001, 235). This remains a challenge to\nbe met in order for science to provide a more full answer to Shelley's\nquestion. \n\nAdvances in computer technology in recent years have permitted\nexploration of life “in silico” as it were. While\ncomputer simulations are utilized by many theoretical biologists, those\nwho explore ‘Artificial Life’ or ‘A-Life’ seek\nto do more than model known living systems. There goal is to place life\nas it is known on earth in a larger conceptual context of any possible\nforms of life (Langton 1989, 1995). Work in A-Life shifts our focus on\nthe processes in living things rather than the material constituents of\ntheir structures per se (Emmeche 1994). In some ways this is a revival\nof the process thinking of the Cambridge biochemists of the 1930s, but\ninvolves a level of abstraction about the material structures that\ninstantiate these processes that they would not have shared. However,\nsuch studies emphasize the organizational relationship between\ncomponents rather than the components themselves, an important focus in\nthe emerging age of “proteomics” in which, in the post\nhuman genome era, the complex, functional interactions of the large\narray of cellular proteins is being studied (Kumar & Snyder 2002).  \n\nA-Life studies can help us to sharpen our ideas about what\ndistinguishes living from non-living and contribute to our definition\nof life. Such work can help delineate the degree of importance of the\ntypical list of attributes of living entities, such as reproduction,\nmetabolism, functional organization, growth, responsiveness to the\nenvironment, movement, and short- and long-term adaptations. A-Life\nwork can also allow exploration about which features of life are due to\nthe constraints of being enmattered in a particular manner and subject\nto physical and chemical laws, as well as exploring a variety of\nfactors that might affect evolutionary scenarios (Etxeberria 2002). For\nexample, the relative potential roles of selection and\nself-organization in the emergence of novel traits in evolutionary time\nmight be evaluated by A-Life research. It is too soon yet to know how\nimportant the contribution of the A-Life program will be, but it is\nlikely to become more prominent in the discourse on the origin and\nnature of life. \n\nOur increased understanding of the physical-chemical basis of living\nsystems has increased enormously over the past century and it is\npossible to give a plausible definition of life in these terms.\n“Living organisms are autopoietic systems: self-constructing,\nself-maintaining, energy-transducing autocatalytic entities” in\nwhich information needed to construct the next generation of organisms\nis stabilized in nucleic acids that replicate within the context of\nwhole cells and work with other developmental resources during the\nlife-cycles of organisms, but they are also “systems capable of\nevolving by variation and natural selection: self-reproducing\nentities, whose forms and functions are adapted to their environment\nand reflect the composition and history of an ecosystem” (Harold\n2001, 232).  Such a perspective represents a fulfillment of the basic\ndual insights of Schrödinger near mid-century. Much remains to be\nelucidated about the relationships among the complex molecular systems\nof living entities, how they are constrained by the system as a whole\nas well as by physical laws. Indeed, it is still an open question for\nsome as to whether we have yet a sufficiently rich understanding of\nthe laws of nature or whether we need to seek deep laws that lead to\norder and organization (Kauffman 2000). At the start of the new\ncentury there is a sense of the importance of putting\nSchrödinger's program into a ‘systems’ context ( see\nfor example Rosen 1991, 2000; Kauffman 1993, 1995, 2000; Depew and\nWeber 1995; Weber & Depew 1996, 2001; Ulanowicz 1997, 2001;\nWilliams and Frausto da Silva 1999; 2002, 2003; Harold 2001; Morowitz\n2002; Bunge 2003; Macdonald and Macdonald 2010). Significant\nchallenges remain, such as fully integrating our new view of organisms\nand their action with evolutionary theory, and to understand plausible\nroutes for the emergence of life. The fulfillment of such a program\nwill give us a good sense of what life is on earth. Work in A-Life and\nempirical work seeking evidence of extra-terrestrial life may help the\nformulation of a more universal concept of life. "}]
