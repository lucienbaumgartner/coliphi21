The major operations\nof change are those consisting in the introduction or removal of a\nbelief-representing sentence. In both cases, changes affecting other\nsentences may be needed (for instance in order to retain consistency).\nRationality postulates for such operations have been proposed, and\nrepresentation theorems have been obtained that characterize specific\ntypes of operations in terms of these postulates.\n\n\nIn the dominant theory of belief revision, the so-called AGM model,\nthe set representing the belief state is assumed to be a logically\nclosed set of sentences (a belief set). One of most debated\ntopics in belief revision theory is the recovery postulate, according\nto which all the original beliefs are regained if one of them is first\nremoved and then reinserted. The recovery postulate holds in the AGM\nmodel but not in closely related models employing belief bases.\nAnother much discussed topic is how repeated changes can be adequately\nrepresented. Several alternative models have been proposed that are\nintended to provide a more realistic account of belief change than\nthat offered by the AGM model. \n\nBelief revision (belief change, belief dynamics) is a young field of\nresearch that has been recognized as a subject of its own since the\nmiddle of the 1980s. The new subject grew out of two converging\nresearch traditions. \nOne of these emerged in computer science. Since the beginning of\ncomputing, programmers have developed procedures by which databases\ncan be updated. The development of Artificial Intelligence inspired\ncomputer scientists to construct more sophisticated models of database\nupdating. The truth maintenance systems developed by Jon Doyle (1979)\nwere important in this development. One of the most significant\ntheoretical contributions was a 1983 paper by Ronald Fagin, Jeffrey\nUllman and Moshe Vardi, in which they introduced the notion of\ndatabase priorities.  \nThe second of these two research traditions is philosophical. In a\nwide sense, belief change has been a subject of philosophical\nreflection since antiquity. In the twentieth century, philosophers\nhave discussed the mechanisms by which scientific theories develop,\nand they have proposed criteria of rationality for revisions of\nprobability assignments. Beginning in the 1970s, a more focused\ndiscussion has taken place on the requirements of rational belief\nchange. Two milestones can be pointed out. The first was a series of\nstudies conducted by Isaac Levi in the 1970s (Levi 1977, 1980). Levi\nposed many of the problems that have since then been major concerns in\nthis field of research. He also provided much of the basic formal\nframework. William Harper’s (1977) work from the same period has\nalso had a lasting influence.  \nThe next milestone was the AGM model, so called after its three\noriginators, Carlos Alchourrón, Peter Gärdenfors, and\nDavid Makinson (1985). Alchourrón and Makinson had previously\ncooperated in studies of changes in legal codes (Alchourrón and\nMakinson 1981, 1982). Gärdenfors’s early work was concerned\nwith the connections between belief change and conditional sentences\n(Gärdenfors 1978, 1981). With combined forces the three wrote a\npaper that provided a new, much more general and versatile formal\nframework for studies of belief change. (On the history of their joint\nwork, see Makinson 2003 and Gärdenfors 2011.) Since the paper was\npublished in the Journal of Symbolic Logic in 1985, its major\nconcepts and constructions have been the subject of significant\nelaboration and development. The AGM model and developments that have\ngrown out of it still form the core of belief revision theory. \nIn the AGM model and most other models of belief change, beliefs are\nrepresented by sentences in some formal language. Sentences do not\ncapture all aspects of belief, but they are the best general-purpose\nrepresentation that is presently available. \nThe beliefs held by an agent are represented by a set of such\nbelief-representing sentences. It is usually assumed that this set is\nclosed under logical consequence, i.e., every sentence that follows\nlogically from this set is already in the set. This is clearly an\nunrealistic idealization, since it means that the agent is taken to be\n“logically omniscient.” However, it is a useful\nidealization since it simplifies the logical treatment; indeed, it\nseems difficult to obtain an interesting formal treatment without it.\nIn logic, logically closed sets are called “theories”. In\nformal epistemology they are also called “corpora”,\n“knowledge sets”, or (more commonly) “belief\nsets”. \nIsaac Levi (1991) has clarified the nature of this idealization by\npointing out that a belief set consists of the sentences that someone\nis committed to believe, not those that she actually\nbelieves in. According to Levi, we are doxastically committed to\nbelieve in all the logical consequences of our beliefs, but typically\nour performance does not live up to this commitment. The belief set is\nthe set of the agent’s epistemic commitments, and therefore\nlarger than the set of her actually held belief. \nIn the AGM framework, there are three types of belief change. In\ncontraction, a specified sentence \\(p\\) is removed,\ni.e., a belief set \\(K\\) is superseded by another belief set\n\\(K\\div p\\) that is a subset of \\(K\\) not\ncontaining \\(p\\). In expansion a sentence \\(p\\) is\nadded to \\(K\\), and nothing is removed, i.e. \\(K\\) is\nreplaced by a set \\(K+p\\) that is the smallest logically\nclosed set that contains both \\(K\\) and \\(p\\). In\nrevision a sentence \\(p\\) is added to \\(K\\), and at\nthe same time other sentences are removed if this is needed to ensure\nthat the resulting belief set \\(K* p\\) is\nconsistent. \nIt is important to note the specific character of these models. They\nare input-assimilating. This means that the object of change,\nthe belief set, is exposed to an input, and is changed as a result of\nthis. No explicit representation of time is included. Instead, the\ncharacteristic mathematical constituent is a function that, to each\npair of a belief set and an input, assigns a new belief set. \nThe belief-representing sentences form a language. (As is usual in\nlogic, the language is identified with the set of all sentences it\ncontains.) Sentences, i.e. elements of this language, will be\nrepresented by lowercase letters \\((p, q\\ldots)\\) and sets of\nsentences by capital letters. This language contains the usual\ntruth-functional connectives: negation \\((\\neg)\\), conjunction\n\\((\\amp)\\), disjunction \\((\\vee)\\), implication \\((\\rightarrow)\\), and\nequivalence (\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)).  \\(\\smbot\\) denotes an arbitrary\ncontradiction (“falsum”), and \\(\\smtop\\) an arbitrary\ntautology. \nTo express the logic, a Tarskian consequence operator will be\nused. Intuitively speaking, for any set \\(A\\) of sentences,\n\\(\\Cn(A)\\) is the set of logical consequences of \\(A\\). More\nformally, a consequence operation on a given language is a function \\(\\Cn\\)\nfrom sets of sentences to sets of sentences. It satisfies the\nfollowing three conditions: \nInclusion:\n \\(A\\subseteq \\Cn(A)\\) \nMonotony: \nIf \\(A\\subseteq B\\), then \\(\\Cn(A) \\subseteq \\Cn(B)\\) \nIteration:\n \\(\\Cn(A) = \\Cn(\\Cn(A))\\) \n\\(\\Cn\\) is assumed to be supraclassical, i.e. if \\(p\\) can be derived\nfrom \\(A\\) by classical truth-functional logic, then \\(p \\in\n\\Cn(A)\\). \\(A\\) is a belief set if and only if \\(A = \\Cn(A)\\). In what\nfollows, \\(K\\) will denote a belief set. \\(X \\vdash p\\) is an\nalternative notation for \\(p \\in \\Cn(X)\\), and \\(X \\not\\vdash p\\)\nfor \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(X)\\). \\(\\Cn(\\varnothing)\\) is the set of\ntautologies. \nThe expansion of \\(K\\) by a sentence \\(p\\), i.e. the\noperation that just adds \\(p\\) and removes nothing, is denoted\n\\(K+p\\) and defined as follows: \\(K+p = \\Cn(K\\cup \\{p\\})\\). \nThe outcome of contracting \\(K\\) by \\(p\\) should be a subset\nof \\(K\\) that does not imply \\(p\\), but from which no\nelements of \\(K\\) have been unnecessarily removed. Therefore, it\nis of interest to consider the inclusion-maximal subsets of \\(K\\)\nthat do not imply \\(p\\). \nFor any set \\(A\\) and sentence \\(p\\) the remainder\nset \\(A\\bot p\\) (“\\(A\\) remainder\n\\(p\\)”) is the set of inclusion-maximal subsets of\n\\(A\\) that do not imply \\(p\\). In other words, a set\n\\(B\\) is an element of \\(A\\bot p\\) if and only if\nit it is a subset of \\(A\\) that does not imply \\(p\\), and\nthere is no set \\(B'\\) not implying \\(p\\) such that\n\\(B\\subset B'\\subseteq A\\). The elements of\n\\(A\\bot p\\) are called “remainders”. \nIf the operation of contraction uncompromisingly minimizes information\nloss, then \\(K\\div p\\) will be one of the remainders.\nHowever, this construction can be shown to have implausible\nproperties. A more reasonable recipe for contraction is to let\n\\(K\\div p\\) be the intersection of some of the\nremainders. This is partial meet contraction, the major\ninnovation in the classic 1985 paper by Carlos Alchourrón,\nPeter Gärdenfors and David Makinson. An operation of partial meet\ncontraction employs a selection function that selects the\n“best” elements of \\(K\\bot p\\). More\nprecisely, a selection function for \\(K\\) is a function \\(\\gamma\\)\nsuch that if \\(K\\bot p\\) is non-empty, then\n\\(\\gamma(K\\bot p)\\) is a non-empty subset of\n\\(K\\bot p\\). In the limiting case when\n\\(K\\bot p\\) is empty, then\n\\(\\gamma(K\\bot p)\\) is defined to be equal to\n\\(\\{K\\}\\). \nThe outcome of the partial meet contraction is equal to the\nintersection of the set of selected elements of\n\\(K\\bot p\\), i.e. \\(K\\div p = \\bigcap \\gamma(K\\bot p)\\). \nThe limiting case when for all sentences \\(p\\),\n\\(\\gamma(K\\bot p)\\) has exactly one element is called\nmaxichoice contraction. The other limiting case in which\n\\(\\gamma(K\\bot p) = K\\bot p\\)\nwhenever \\(K\\bot p\\) is non-empty is called full\nmeet contraction. Both limiting cases are technically useful, but\nthey also both have highly unrealistic properties. \nPartial meet contraction of a belief set satisfies six postulates that\nare called the basic Gärdenfors postulates (or basic AGM\npostulates). To begin with, when a belief set \\(K\\) is contracted\nby a sentence \\(p\\), the outcome should be logically closed. \nClosure:\n \\(K\\div p = \\Cn(K\\div p)\\)\n \nContraction should be successful, i.e., \\(K\\div p\\)\nshould not imply \\(p\\) (or not contain \\(p\\), which is the\nsame thing if Closure is satisfied). However, it would be too much to\nrequire that \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(K\\div p)\\) for\nall sentences \\(p\\), since it cannot hold if \\(p\\) is a\ntautology. The success postulate has to be conditional on \\(p\\)\nnot being logically true. \nSuccess:\n If \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(K\\div p)\\).\n \nThe Success postulate has been put in doubt since there may be\nsentences other than tautologies that an epistemic agent may refuse to\nwithdraw. (On operations that do not satisfy Success, see Section\n6.5.) \nThe contracted set is assumed to be a subset of the original one: \nInclusion:\n \\(K\\div p \\subseteq K\\)\n \nInclusion is usually considered to be a constitutive property of\ncontraction. However, it has also been questioned with the argument\nthat when the epistemic agent ceases to believe in \\(p\\), then\nthis is usually because she receives some new information that\ncontradicts \\(p\\). Arguably, that information should be included\nin \\(K\\div p\\).  \nIf the sentence to be contracted is not included in the original\nbelief set, then contraction by that sentence involves no change at\nall. Such contractions are idle (vacuous) operations, and they should\nleave the original set unchanged. \nVacuity:\n If \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(K)\\), then \\(K\\div p = K\\).\n \nLogically equivalent sentences should be treated alike in\ncontraction: \nExtensionality:\n If \\(p\\leftrightarrow q \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(K\\div p = K\\div q\\).\n \nExtensionality guarantees that the logic of contraction is extensional\nin the sense of allowing logically equivalent sentences to be freely\nsubstituted for each other. \nBelief contraction should not only be successful, it should also be\nminimal in the sense of leading to the loss of as few\nprevious beliefs as possible. The epistemic agent should give up\nbeliefs only when forced to do so, and should then give up as few of\nthem as possible. This is ensured by the following postulate: \nRecovery:\n\\(K \\subseteq (K\\div p)+p\\)\n \nAccording to Recovery, so much is retained after \\(p\\) has been\nremoved that everything will be recovered by reinclusion (through\nexpansion) of \\(p\\). \nOne of the central results about the AGM model is a representation\ntheorem for partial meet contraction. According to this theorem, an\noperation \\(\\div\\) is a partial meet contraction for a belief set\n\\(K\\) if and only if it satisfies the six above-mentioned\npostulates, namely Closure, Success, Inclusion, Vacuity,\nExtensionality, and Recovery. \nA selection function for a belief set \\(K\\) should, for all\nsentences \\(p\\), select those elements of\n\\(K\\bot p\\) that are “best”, or most worth\nretaining. However, the definition of a selection function is very\ngeneral, and allows for quite disorderly selection patterns. An\norderly selection function should always choose the best element(s) of\nthe remainder set according to some well-behaved preference relation.\nA selection function \\(\\gamma\\) for a belief set \\(K\\) is\nrelational if and only if there is a binary relation\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\) such that for all sentences \\(p\\), if\n\\(K\\bot p\\) is non-empty, then\n\\(\\gamma(K\\bot p) = \\{B \\in K\\bot p \\mid C\\mathbf{R}B\\)\nfor all \\(C \\in K\\bot p\\}\\). Furthermore, if\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is transitive (i.e., it satisfies: If\n\\(A\\mathbf{R}B\\) and\n\\(B\\mathbf{R}C\\), then\n\\(A\\mathbf{R}C)\\), then \\(\\gamma\\) and the partial\nmeet contraction that it gives rise to are transitively\nrelational. \nIn order to characterize transitively relational partial meet\ncontraction, postulates are needed that refer to contraction by\nconjunctions. \nIn order to give up a conjunction \\(p \\amp q\\), the agent\nmust relinquish either her belief in \\(p\\) or her belief in\n\\(q\\) (or both). Suppose that contracting by\n\\(p \\amp q\\) leads to loss of the belief in \\(p\\),\ni.e., that \\(p \\not\\in K\\div(p \\amp q)\\). It can be expected that\nin this case contraction by \\(p \\amp q\\) should lead to\nthe loss of all beliefs that would have been lost in order to contract\nby \\(p\\). Another way to express this is that everything that is\nretained in \\(K\\div(p \\amp q)\\) is also\nretained in \\(K\\div p\\): \nConjunctive inclusion:\n If \\(p \\not\\in K\\div(p \\amp q)\\), then \\(K\\div(p \\amp q) \\subseteq K\\div p\\).\n \nAnother fairly reasonable principle for contraction by conjunctions is\nthat whatever can withstand both contraction by \\(p\\) and\ncontraction by \\(q\\) can also withstand contraction by\n\\(p \\amp q\\). In other words, whatever is an element of\nboth \\(K\\div p\\) and \\(K\\div q\\) is\nalso an element of \\(K\\div(p \\amp q)\\). \nConjunctive overlap:\n \\((K\\div p) \\cap (K\\div q) \\subseteq K\\div(p \\amp q)\\)\n \nConjunctive overlap and Conjunctive inclusion are commonly called\nGärdenfors’s supplementary postulates for belief\ncontraction. An operation \\(\\div\\) for \\(K\\) is a transitively\nrelational partial meet contraction if and only if it satisfies the\nsix basic postulates and in addition both Conjunctive overlap and\nConjunctive inclusion. \nWhen forced to give up previous beliefs, the epistemic agent should\ngive up beliefs that have as little explanatory power and overall\ninformational value as possible. As an example of this, in the choice\nbetween giving up beliefs in natural laws and beliefs in single\nfactual statements, beliefs in the natural laws, that have much higher\nexplanatory power, should in general be retained. This was the basic\nidea behind Peter Gärdenfors’s proposal that contraction of\nbeliefs should be ruled by a binary relation, epistemic\nentrenchment. (Gärdenfors 1988, Gärdenfors and Makinson\n1988) To say of two elements \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) of the belief\nset that “\\(q\\) is more entrenched than \\(p\\)”\nmeans that \\(q\\) is more useful in inquiry or deliberation, or\nhas more “epistemic value” than \\(p\\). In belief\ncontraction, the beliefs with the lowest entrenchment should be the\nones that are most readily given up. \nThe following symbols will be used for epistemic entrenchment:  \\(p\\le q : p\\) is at most as entrenched as \\(q\\). \n\\(p\\lt q : p\\) is less entrenched than \\(q\\). \\(((p\\le q) \\amp \\neg(q\\le p)))\\) \n\\(p\\equiv q : p\\) and \\(q\\) are equally entrenched. \\(((p\\le q) \\amp(q\\le p))\\) \nGärdenfors has proposed the following five postulates for\nepistemic entrenchment. They are often referred to as the standard\npostulates for entrenchment: \nTransitivity:\n If \\(p\\le q\\) and \\(q\\le r\\), then \\(p\\le r\\). \nDominance:\n If \\(p \\vdash q\\), then \\(p\\le q\\). \nConjunctiveness:\n Either \\(p\\le(p \\amp q)\\) or \\(q\\le(p \\amp q)\\). \nMinimality:\n If the belief set \\(K\\) is consistent, then \\(p \\not\\in K\\) if and only if \\(p\\le q\\) for all \\(q\\). \nMaximality:\n If \\(q\\le p\\) for all \\(q\\), then \\(p \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\). \nIt follows from the first three of these postulates that an\nentrenchment relation satisfies connectivity (completeness), i.e. it\nholds for all \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) that either \\(p\\le q\\) or \n\\(q\\le p\\). \nAn entrenchment relation \\(\\le\\) gives rise to an operation \\(\\div\\) of\nentrenchment-based contraction according to the following\ndefinition: \n\\(q \\in K\\div p\\) if and only if\n\\(q \\in K\\) and either \\(p \\lt(p \\vee q)\\) or \\(p \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\).\n \nEntrenchment-based contraction has been shown to coincide exactly with\ntransitively relational partial meet contraction. For a thorough\ndiscussion and more results on entrenchment relations, see Rott\n2001. \nRecovery is the most debated postulate of belief change. It is easy to\nfind examples that seem to validate Recovery. A person who first loses\nand then regains her belief that she has a dollar in her pocket seems\nto return to her previous state of belief. However, other examples can\nalso be presented, in which Recovery yields implausible results. The\nfollowing are two of the examples that have been offered to show that\nRecovery does not hold in general: \nI have read in a book about Cleopatra that she had both a son and a\ndaughter. My set of beliefs therefore contains both \\(p\\) and\n\\(q\\), where \\(p\\) denotes that Cleopatra had a son and\n\\(q\\) that she had a daughter. I then learn from a knowledgeable\nfriend that the book is in fact a historical novel. After that I\ncontract \\(p\\vee q\\) from my set of beliefs, i.e., I do\nnot any longer believe that Cleopatra had a child. Soon after that,\nhowever, I learn from a reliable source that Cleopatra had a child. It\nseems perfectly reasonable for me to then add \\(p\\vee q\\)\nto my set of beliefs without also reintroducing either \\(p\\) or\n\\(q\\). This contradicts Recovery. \nI previously entertained the two beliefs “George is a\ncriminal” \\((p)\\) and “George is a mass\nmurderer” \\((q)\\). When I received information that induced\nme to give up the first of these beliefs \\((p)\\), the second\n\\((q)\\) had to go as well (since \\(p\\) would otherwise\nfollow from \\(q)\\). \nI then received new information that made me accept the belief\n“George is a shoplifter” \\((r)\\). The resulting new belief\nset is the expansion of \\(K\\div p\\) by \\(r\\), \\((K\\div p)+r.\\) Since\n\\(p\\) follows from \\(r\\), \\((K\\div p)+p\\) is a subset of \\((K\\div\np)+r\\). By recovery, \\((K\\div p)+p\\) includes \\(q\\), from which\nfollows that \\((K\\div p)+r\\) includes \\(q\\). \nThus, since I previously believed George to be a mass murderer, it\nfollows from Recovery that I cannot after that believe him to be a\nshoplifter without believing him to be a mass murderer. \nDue to the problematic nature of this postulate, it should be\ninteresting to find intuitively less controversial postulates that\nprevent unnecessary losses in contraction. The following is an attempt\nto do that: \nCore-retainment:\nIf \\(q \\in K\\) and \\(q \\not\\in K\\div p\\), then there is a belief set\n\\(K'\\) such that \\(K' \\subseteq K\\) and that \\(p \\not\\in K'\\) but \\(p\n\\in K'+q\\).\n \nCore-retainment requires of an excluded sentence \\(q\\) that it in\nsome way contributes to the fact that \\(K\\) implies \\(p\\).\nIt gives the impression of being weaker and more plausible than\nRecovery. However, it has been shown that if an operator \\(\\div\\) for\na belief set \\(K\\) satisfies Core-retainment, then it satisfies\nRecovery. \nAttempts have been made to construct operations of contraction on\nbelief sets that do not satisfy Recovery. Arguably, the most plausible\nof these constructions is the operation of severe withdrawal\nthat has been thoroughly investigated by Hans Rott and Maurice\nPagnucco (2000). It can be constructed from an operation of epistemic\nentrenchment by modifying the definition as follows: \n\\(q \\in K\\div p\\) if and only if\n\\(q \\in K\\) and either \\(p \\lt q\\) or\n\\(p \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\).\n \nSevere withdrawal has interesting features, but it also has the\nfollowing property: \nExpulsiveness:\nIf \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\) and \\(q \\not\\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\)\nthen either \\(p \\not\\in K\\div q\\) or \\(q \\not\\in K\\div p\\).\n \nThis is a highly implausible property of belief contraction, since it\ndoes not allow unrelated beliefs to be undisturbed by each\nother’s contraction. Consider a scholar who believes that her\ncar is parked in front of the house. She also believes that\nShakespeare wrote the Tempest. It should be possible for her to give\nup the first of these beliefs while retaining the second. She should\nalso be able to give up the second without giving up the first.\nExpulsiveness does not allow this. The construction of a plausible\noperation of contraction for belief sets that does not satisfy\nRecovery is still an open issue. \nThe two major tasks of an operation \\(*\\) of revision are (1) to\nadd the new belief \\(p\\) to the belief set \\(K\\), and (2) to\nensure that the resulting belief set \\(K* p\\) is\nconsistent (unless \\(p\\) is inconsistent). The first task can be\naccomplished by expansion by \\(p\\). The second can be\naccomplished by prior contraction by its negation \\(\\neg p\\). If\na belief set does not imply \\(\\neg p\\), then \\(p\\) can be\nadded to it without loss of consistency. This composition of\nsuboperations gives rise to the following definition of revision\n(Gärdenfors 1981, Levi 1977): \nLevi identity:\n \\(K* p = (K\\div \\neg p)+p\\).\n \nIf \\(\\div\\) is a partial meet contraction, then the operation \\(*\\)\nthat is defined in this way is a partial meet revision. This\nis the standard construction of revision in the AGM model. \nPartial meet revision has been axiomatically characterized. An\noperation \\(*\\) is a partial meet revision if and only if it\nsatisfies the following six postulates: \nClosure:\n \\(K* p = \\Cn(K* p)\\) \nSuccess:\n \\(p \\in K* p\\) \nInclusion:\n \\(K* p \\subseteq K+p\\) \nVacuity:\n If \\(\\neg p \\not\\in\\) K, then\n\\(K* p = K+p\\). \nConsistency:\n \\(K* p\\) is consistent if\n\\(p\\) is consistent. \nExtensionality:\n If \\((p \\leftrightarrow q) \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(K* p = K* q\\). \nThese six postulates are commonly called the basic Gärdenfors\npostulates for revision. In addition, two supplementary\npostulates are parts of the standard repertoire: \nSuperexpansion:\n \\(K* (p \\amp q) \\subseteq(K* p)+q\\) \nSubexpansion:\n If \\(\\neg q \\not\\in \\Cn(K* p)\\), then \\((K* p)+q \\subseteq K* (p \\amp q)\\). \nThese postulates are closely related to the supplementary postulates\nfor contraction. Let \\(*\\) be the partial meet revision defined\nfrom the partial meet contraction \\(\\div\\) via the Levi identity. Then\n\\(*\\) satisfies superexpansion if and only if \\(\\div\\) satisfies\nconjunctive overlap. Furthermore, \\(*\\) satisfies subexpansion if\nand only if \\(\\div\\) satisfies conjunctive inclusion. \nAlternative models of belief states can be constructed out of sets of\npossible worlds (Grove 1988). In logical parlance, by a possible\nworld is meant a maximal consistent subset of the language. By a\nproposition is meant a set of possible worlds. There is a\none-to-one correspondence between propositions and belief sets. Each\nbelief set can be represented by the proposition (set of possible\nworlds) that consists of those possible worlds that contain the belief\nset in question. \nFor any set \\(A\\) of sentences, let \\([A]\\) denote the set of possible\nworlds that contain \\(A\\) as a subset, and similarly for any sentence\n\\(p\\) let \\([p]\\) be the set of possible worlds that contain \\(p\\) as\nan element. If \\(A\\) is inconsistent, then \\([A] =\n\\varnothing\\). Otherwise, \\([A]\\) is a non-empty set of possible\nworlds. (It is assumed that \\(\\bigcap \\varnothing\\) is equal to the\nwhole language.) If \\(K\\) is a belief set, then \\(\\bigcap[K] =\nK\\). \nThe propositional account provides an intuitively clear picture of\nsome aspects of belief change. It is convenient to use a geometrical\nsurface to represent the set of possible worlds. In Diagram\n1, every point on the rectangle’s surface represents a\npossible world. The circle marked \\([K]\\) represents those\npossible worlds in which all sentences in \\(K\\) are true, i.e.,\nthe set \\([K]\\) of possible worlds. The area marked \\([p]\\)\nrepresents those possible worlds in which the sentence \\(p\\) is\ntrue. Diagram 1. Revision of \\(K\\) by \\(p\\). \nIn Diagram 1, \\([K]\\) and \\([p]\\) have a non-empty\nintersection, which means that \\(K\\) is compatible with\n\\(p\\). The revision of \\(K\\) by \\(p\\) is therefore not\nbelief-contravening. Its outcome is obtained by giving up those\nelements of \\([K]\\) that are incompatible with \\(p\\). In\nother words, the result of revising \\([K]\\) by \\([p]\\)\nshould be equal to \\([K]\\cap[p]\\). \nIf \\([K]\\) and \\([p]\\) do not intersect, then the outcome of\nthe revision must be sought outside of \\([K]\\), but it should\nnevertheless be a subset of \\([p]\\). In general: \nThe outcome of revising \\([K]\\) by \\([p]\\) is a subset of\n\\([p]\\) that is \nThis simple rule for revision can be shown to correspond exactly\nto partial meet revision. \nThe revised belief state should not differ more from the original\nbelief state \\([K]\\) than what is motivated by \\([p]\\). This\ncan be achieved by requiring that the outcome of revising \\([K]\\)\nby \\([p]\\) consists of those elements of \\([p]\\) that are as\nclose as possible to \\([K]\\). For that purpose, \\([K]\\) can\nbe thought of as surrounded by a system of concentric spheres (just as\nin David Lewis’s account of counterfactual conditionals). Each\nsphere represents a degree of closeness or similarity to\n\\([K]\\). \nIn this model, the outcome of revising \\([K]\\) by \\([p]\\)\nshould be the intersection of \\([p]\\) with the narrowest sphere\naround \\([K]\\) that has a non-empty intersection with\n\\([p]\\), as in Diagram 2. This construction was invented\nby Adam Grove (1988), who also proved that such sphere-based revision\ncorresponds exactly to transitively relational partial meet\nrevision. It follows that it also corresponds exactly to\nentrenchment-based revision. Diagram 2.\nSphere-based revision of \\(K\\) by \\(p\\). \nPossible world models can also be used for contraction. In\ncontraction, a restriction on what worlds are “possible”\n(compatible with the agent’s beliefs) is removed. Thus, the set\nof possibilities is enlarged, so that the contraction of \\([K]\\)\nby \\([p]\\) will result in a superset of \\([K]\\).\nFurthermore, the new possibilities should be worlds in which\n\\(p\\) does not hold, i.e., they should be worlds in which\n\\(\\neg p\\) holds. In the limiting case when \\([K]\\) and\n\\([\\neg p]\\) have a non-empty intersection, no enlargement of\n\\([K]\\) is necessary to make \\(\\neg p\\) possible, and the\noriginal belief state will therefore be unchanged. In summary,\ncontraction should be performed according to the following rule: \nThe outcome of contracting \\([K]\\) by \\([p]\\) is the union\nof \\([K]\\) and a subset of \\([\\neg p]\\) that is \nBelief-contravening contraction is illustrated in Diagram 3.\nContraction performed according to this rule can be shown to\ncorrespond exactly to partial meet contraction. Furthermore,\nthe special case when the whole of \\([\\neg p]\\) is added to\n\\([K]\\) corresponds exactly to full meet contraction.\nThe other extreme case, when only one element of \\([\\neg p]\\) (a\n“point” on the surface) is added to \\([K]\\)\ncorresponds exactly to maxichoice contraction. Thus, in\nmaxichoice contraction by \\(p\\) only one possible way in which\n\\(p\\) can be false \\((\\neg p\\) can be true) is added. Diagram 3.\nContraction of \\(K\\) by \\(p\\). \nGrove’s sphere systems can also be used for contraction. In\nsphere-based contraction by \\(p\\), those elements of\n\\([\\neg p]\\) are added that belong to the closest sphere around\n\\([K]\\) that has a non-empty intersection with \\([\\neg p]\\).\nThe procedure is shown in Diagram 4. Sphere-based contraction\ncorresponds exactly to transitively relational partial meet\ncontraction. Diagram 4.\nSphere-based contraction of \\(K\\) by \\(p\\). \nIn the approaches discussed above, all beliefs in the belief set are\ntreated equally in the sense that they are all taken seriously as\nbeliefs in their own right. However, due to logical closure the belief\nset contains many elements that are not really worth to be taken\nseriously. Hence, suppose that the belief set contains the sentence\n\\(p\\), “Shakespeare wrote Hamlet”. Due to logical\nclosure it then also contains the sentence \\(p \\vee q\\),\n“Either Shakespeare wrote Hamlet or Charles Dickens wrote\nHamlet”. The latter sentence is a “mere logical\nconsequence” that should have no standing of its own. \nBelief bases have been introduced to capture this feature of the\nstructure of human beliefs. A belief base is a set of sentences that\nis not (except as a limiting case) closed under logical consequence.\nIts elements represent beliefs that are held independently of any\nother belief or set of beliefs. Those elements of the belief set that\nare not in the belief base are “merely derived”, i.e.,\nthey have no independent standing. \nChanges are performed on the belief base. The underlying intuition is\nthat the merely derived beliefs are not worth retaining for their own\nsake. If one of them loses the support that it had in basic beliefs,\nthen it will be automatically discarded. \nFor every belief base \\(A\\), there is a belief set \\(\\Cn(A)\\)\nthat represents the beliefs held according to \\(A\\). On the other\nhand, one and the same belief set can be represented by different\nbelief bases. In this sense, belief bases have more expressive power\nthan belief sets. As an example, the two belief bases \\(\\{p,\nq\\}\\) and \\(\\{p, p \\leftrightarrow q\\}\\) have the\nsame logical closure. They are therefore statically\nequivalent, in the sense of representing the same beliefs. On the\nother hand, the following example shows that they are not\ndynamically equivalent in the sense of behaving in the same\nway under operations of change. They can be taken to represent\ndifferent ways of holding the same beliefs. \nLet \\(p\\) denote that the Liberal Party will support the proposal\nto subsidize the steel industry, and let \\(q\\) denote that Ms.\nSmith, who is a liberal MP, will vote in favour of that proposal. \nAbe has the basic beliefs \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), whereas Bob has\nthe basic beliefs \\(p\\) and \\(p \\leftrightarrow q.\\) Thus,\ntheir beliefs (on the belief set level) with respect to \\(p\\) and\n\\(q\\) are the same. \nBoth Abe and Bob receive and accept the information that \\(p\\) is\nwrong, and they both revise their belief states to include the new\nbelief that \\(\\neg p\\). After that, Abe has the basic beliefs\n\\(\\neg p\\) and \\(q\\), whereas Bob has the basic beliefs\n\\(\\neg p\\) and \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\). Now, their belief\nsets are no longer the same. Abe believes that \\(q\\) whereas Bob\nbelieves that \\(\\neg q\\). \n(In belief set models, cases like these are taken care of by assuming\nthat although Abe’s and Bob’s belief states are\nrepresented by the same belief set, this belief set is associated with\ndifferent selection mechanisms in the two cases. Abe has a selection\nmechanism that gives priority to \\(q\\) over \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\), whereas Bob’s selection mechanism has the opposite\npriorities.) \nThere is only one inconsistent belief set (logically closed\ninconsistent set), namely the whole language. On the other hand there\nare, in any non-trivial logic, many different inconsistent belief\nbases. Therefore, belief bases make it possible to distinguish between\ndifferent inconsistent belief states. \nIn belief revision theory it has mostly been taken for granted that\nbelief sets correspond to a coherentist epistemology, whereas belief\nbases represent foundationalism. However, the logical relationships\namong the elements of a logically closed set do not adequately\nrepresent epistemic coherence. Although coherentists typically claim\nthat all beliefs contribute to the justification of other\nbeliefs, they hardly mean this to apply to merely derived beliefs such\nas “either Paris or Rome is the capital of France”, that\none believes only because one believes Paris to be the capital of\nFrance. Therefore, the distinction between operations on belief bases\nand operations on belief sets should not be equated with that between\nfoundationalism and coherentism. \nPartial meet contraction, as defined in Section 2.1, is equally\napplicable to belief bases. Note that \\(A\\bot p\\) is\nthe set of maximal subsets of \\(A\\) that do not imply \\(p\\);\nit is not sufficient that they do not contain \\(p\\). Hence  \nMost of the basic postulates for partial meet contraction on belief\nsets hold for belief bases as well. However, Recovery does not hold\nfor partial meet contraction of belief bases. This can be seen from\nthe following example (that is adopted from Isaac Levi (2004) who used\nit for other purposes: \nLet the belief set \\(K\\) include both a belief that the coin was\ntossed \\((c)\\) and a belief that it landed heads \\((h)\\).\nThe epistemic agent wishes to consider whether, on the supposition\nthat the coin had been tossed, it would have landed heads. In order to\ndo that, it would seem reasonable to remove \\(c\\) from the belief\nset and then reinsert it, i.e. to perform the series of operations\n\\(K\\div c+c\\). \n(1) If partial meet contraction is performed directly on the belief\nset, then it follows from Recovery that \\(h \\in K\\div c+c\\),\ni.e. \\(h\\) comes back with \\(c\\). This is contrary to reasonable\nintuitions. \n(2) If partial meet contraction is instead performed on a belief base\nfor \\(K\\), then recovery can be avoided. Let the belief base be\n\\(\\{p_1 ,\\ldots ,p_n, c, h\\}\\), where the background beliefs \\(p_1\n,\\ldots ,p_n\\) are unrelated to \\(c\\) and \\(h\\), whereas \\(h\\)\nlogically implies \\(c\\). Then \\(K = \\Cn(\\{p_1 ,\\ldots ,p_n, c,\nh\\})\\). Since \\(h\\) implies \\(c\\), it will have to go when \\(c\\) is\nremoved, so that \\(K\\div c = \\Cn(\\{p_1 ,\\ldots ,p_n\\})\\). When \\(c\\)\nis reinserted, the outcome is \\((K\\div c)+c = \\Cn(\\{p_1 ,\\ldots ,p_n,\nc\\})\\) that does not contain \\(h\\), as desired. \nThe following representation theorem has been obtained for partial\nmeet contraction on belief bases (Hansson 1999). An operation \\(\\div\\)\nis a partial meet contraction for a set \\(A\\) if and only if it\nsatisfies the following four postulates: \nSuccess:\n If \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(A\\div p)\\). \nInclusion:\n \\(A\\div p \\subseteq A\\) \nRelevance:\n If \\(q \\in A\\) and \\(q \\not\\in A\\div p\\), then there is a set\n\\(A'\\) such that \\(A\\div p \\subseteq A' \\subseteq A\\) and that \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(A')\\) but \n\\(p \\in \\Cn(A'\\cup \\{q\\})\\). \nUniformity:\n If it holds for all subsets \\(A'\\) of \\(A\\) that \\(p \\in \\Cn(A')\\) if\nand only if \\(q \\in \\Cn(A')\\), then \\(A\\div p = A\\div q\\). \nThe Relevance postulate has much the same function as Recovery has for\nbelief sets, namely to prevent unnecessary losses of beliefs. \nAn alternative approach to contraction of belief bases has been\nproposed under the name kernel contraction. For any sentence\n\\(p\\), a \\(p\\)-kernel is a minimal \\(p\\)-implying set,\ni.e. a set that implies \\(p\\) but has no proper subset that\nimplies \\(p\\). A contraction operation \\(\\div\\) can be based on\nthe simple principle that no \\(p\\)-kernel should be included in\n\\(A\\div p\\). This can be obtained with an incision\nfunction, a function that selects at least one element from each\n\\(p\\)-kernel for removal. An operation that removes exactly those\nelements that are selected for removal by an incision function is\ncalled a kernel contraction. It turns out that all partial meet\ncontractions on belief bases are kernel contractions, but some kernel\ncontractions are not partial meet contractions. In other words, kernel\ncontraction is a generalization of partial meet contraction. \nThe operation of expansion for belief sets, \\(K+p = \\Cn(K\\cup\n\\{p\\})\\), was constructed to ensure that the outcome is logically\nclosed. This is not desirable for belief bases, and therefore\nexpansion on belief bases must be different from expansion on belief\nsets. For any belief base \\(A\\) and sentence \\(p,\\) \\(A +' p\\), the\n(non-closing) expansion of \\(A\\) by \\(p\\), is the\nset \\(A\\cup \\{p\\}\\). \nJust like the corresponding operations for belief sets, revision\noperations for belief bases can be constructed out of two\nsuboperations: expansion by \\(p\\) and contraction by\n\\(\\neg p\\). According to the Levi identity,\n\\((A* p = (A\\div \\neg p)\n+' p)\\), the contractive suboperation should take place\nfirst. Alternatively, the two suboperations may take place in reverse\norder, \\(A* p = (A+'p)\n\\div \\neg p\\). This latter possibility does not exist for\nbelief sets. If \\(K\\cup \\{p\\}\\) is inconsistent, then\n\\(K+p\\) is always the same, namely identical to the\nwhole language, independently of the identity of \\(K\\) and of\n\\(p\\), so that all distinctions are lost. For belief bases, this\nlimitation is not present, and thus there are two distinct ways to\nobtain revision from contraction and expansion: \nInternal revision:\n \\(A * p = (A \\div \\neg p) +' p\\) \nExternal revision:\n \\(A * p = (A +' p) \\div \\neg p\\) \nIntuitively, external revision by \\(p\\) is revision with an\nintermediate inconsistent state in which both \\(p\\) and\n\\(\\neg p\\) are believed, whereas internal revision has an\nintermediate non-committed state in which neither \\(p\\)\nnor \\(\\neg p\\) is believed. External and internal revision differ\nin their logical properties, and neither of them can be subsumed under\nthe other. \nA contraction on a belief base gives rise to a contraction on its\ncorresponding belief set. Let \\(A\\) be a belief base and\n\\(K = \\Cn(A)\\) its corresponding belief set. Furthermore,\nlet \\(-\\) be a contraction on \\(A\\). It gives rise to an\noperation \\(\\div\\) of base-generated contraction on\n\\(K\\), such that for all sentences \\(p:\nK\\div p = \\Cn(A-p)\\).\nBase-generated contraction has been axiomatically characterized. An\noperation \\(\\div\\) on a consistent belief set \\(K\\) is generated\nby an operation of partial meet contraction for some finite base for\n\\(K\\) if and only if it satisfies the following eight\npostulates: \nClosure:\n \\(K\\div p = \\Cn(K\\div p)\\) \nSuccess:\n If \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(K\\div p)\\). \nInclusion:\n \\(K\\div p \\subseteq K\\) \nVacuity:\n If \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(K)\\), then \\(K\\div p = K\\). \nExtensionality:\n If \\(p\\leftrightarrow q \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(K\\div p = K\\div q\\). \nFinitude:\n There is a finite set \\(X\\) such that for every sentence \\(p\\), \\(K\\div p\n= \\Cn(X')\\) for some \\(X' \\subseteq X\\). \nSymmetry:\nIf it holds for all \\(r\\) that \\(K\\div r \\vdash p\\) if and only if\n\\(K\\div r \\vdash q\\), then \\(K\\div p = K\\div q\\). \nConservativity:\nIf \\(K\\div q\\) is not a subset of \\(K\\div p\\), then there is some\n\\(r\\) such that \\(K\\div p \\subseteq K\\div r \\not\\vdash p\\) and \\(K\\div\nr \\cup K\\div q \\vdash p\\). \nOperations of revision on a belief set can be base-generated in the\nsame sense as operations of contraction. \nThe AGM framework has been extended in many ways. Some of these\nextensions have introduced new types of operations in addition to the\nthree standard types in AGM, namely contraction, expansion, and\nrevision. \nThere are two types of reasons why the epistemic agent may wish to add\nnew information to the belief set. One is that she has received new\ninformation about the world, the other that the world has changed. It\nis common to reserve the term “revision” for the first of\nthese types, and use the term “updating” for the second.\nThe logic of updating differs from that of revision. This can be seen\nfrom the following example: \nTo begin with, the agent knows that there is either a book on the\ntable \\((p)\\) or a magazine on the table \\((q)\\), but not\nboth. \nCase 1: The agent is told that there is a book on the table. She\nconcludes that there is no magazine on the table. This is\nrevision. \nCase 2: The agent is told that after the first information was given,\na book has been put on the table. In this case she should not conclude\nthat there is no magazine on the table. This is updating. \nOne useful approach to updating is to assign time indices to the\nsentences, as proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon (1992). Then the\nbelief set will not consist of sentences \\(p\\) but of pairs \\(\\langle\np,t_1\\rangle\\) of a sentence \\(p\\) and a point in time \\(t_1\\),\nsignifying that \\(p\\) holds at \\(t_1\\). In the book-and-magazine\nexample, let \\(t_1\\) denote the point in time that the first statement\nrefers to, and \\(t_2\\) the moment when the second information was\ngiven in Case 2. The original belief set contained the pair \\(\\langle\n\\neg(p\\leftrightarrow q),t_1\\rangle\\). (\\(\\neg(p\\leftrightarrow q)\\)\nis the exclusive disjunction of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).) Revision by \\(p\\)\ncan be represented by the incorporation of \\(\\langle p,t_1\\rangle\\), and\nupdating by \\(p\\) by the incorporation of \\(\\langle p,t_2\\rangle\\) into the\nbelief set. It follows quite naturally that \\(\\langle \\neg q,t_1\\rangle\\) is\nimplied by the revised belief set but not by the updated belief\nset. \nIf a belief base is inconsistent, then it can be made consistent by\nremoving enough of its more dispensable elements. This operation is\ncalled consolidation. The consolidation of a belief base \\(A\\) is\ndenoted \\(A!\\). A plausible way to perform consolidation is to\ncontract by falsum (contradiction), i.e. \\(A! = A\\div\\smbot\\). \nUnfortunately, this recipe for consolidation of inconsistent belief\nbases does not have a plausible counterpart for inconsistent belief\nsets. The reason is that since belief revision operates within\nclassical logic, there is only one inconsistent belief set. Once an\ninconsistent belief set has been obtained, all distinctions have been\nlost, and consolidation cannot restore them. \nBy non-prioritized belief change is meant a process in which new\ninformation is received, and weighed against old information, with no\nspecial priority assigned to the new information due to its novelty. A\n(modified) revision operation that operates in this way is called a\nsemi-revision. Semi-revision of \\(K\\) by a sentence \\(p\\)\ncan be denoted \\(K?p\\). A sentence \\(p\\) that\ncontradicts previous beliefs is accepted only if it has more epistemic\nvalue than the original beliefs that contradict it. In that case,\nenough of the previous sentences are deleted to make the resulting set\nconsistent. Otherwise, the input is itself rejected. \nOne way to construct semi-revision on a belief base \\(A\\) is to\nlet it consist of two suboperations: \nThis amounts to defining semi-revision in terms of expansion and\nconsolidation: \nThis identity cannot be used for belief sets. Since all inconsistent\nbelief sets are identical, an operation ? such that\n\\(K?p = (K+p)!\\) will have the\nextremely implausible property that if \\(\\neg p_1 \\in K_1\\) and \\(\\neg p_2 \\in K_2\\), then\n\\(K_1 ?p_1 = K_2 ?p_2\\). However, other ways to\nperform semirevision on belief sets have been proposed, in particular,\nthe following two-step process: \nA simple way to apply this recipe is David Makinson’s (1997)\nscreened revision, in which there is a set \\(X\\) of\npotential core beliefs that are immune to revision. The belief set\n\\(K\\) should be revised by the input sentence \\(p\\) if\n\\(p\\) is consistent with the set \\(X\\cap K\\) of\nactual core beliefs, otherwise not. The second step of screened\nrevision is a revision of \\(K\\) by \\(p\\), but with the\nrestriction that no element of \\(X\\cap K\\) is allowed to\nbe removed. \nAnother variant of the same recipe is called credibility-limited\nrevision. It is based on the assumption that some inputs are\naccepted, others not. Those that are accepted form the set C of\ncredible sentences. If \\(p \\in\\) C, then \\(K?p = K* p\\). Otherwise, \\(K?p = K\\). This construction can be further specified by choosing an\noperation of revision and assigning properties to the set C. A variety\nof such constructions have been investigated (Hansson et al.\n2001). \nSelective revision is a generalization of semi-revision. In\nsemi-revision, the input information is either rejected or fully\naccepted. In selective revision, it is possible for only a part of the\ninput information to be accepted. An operation \\(\\circ\\) of selective\nrevision can be constructed from a standard revision operation\n\\(*\\) and a transformation function \\(f\\) from and to\nsentences: \nIn the intended cases, \\(f(p)\\) does not contain any\ninformation that is not contained in \\(p\\). This is ensured if\n\\(f(p)\\) is a logical consequence of \\(p\\). By\nadding further conditions on \\(f\\), various additional properties\ncan be obtained for the operation of selective revision. \nThe Success postulate of contraction requires that all\nnon-tautological beliefs are retractable. This is not a fully\nrealistic requirement, since actual agents are known to have beliefs\nof a non-logical nature that nothing can bring them to give up. In\nshielded contraction, some non-tautological beliefs cannot be given\nup; they are shielded from contraction. Shielded contraction can be\nbased on an ordinary contraction \\(\\div\\) and a set \\(R\\) of\nretractable sentences. If \\(p \\in R\\), then\n\\(K-p = K\\div p\\). Otherwise,\n\\(K-p = K\\). \nThis construction can be further specified by adding various\nrequirements on the structure of \\(R\\). Close connections have\nbeen shown to hold between shielded contraction and semi-revision.\n(Fermé and Hansson 2001) \nBy replacement is meant an operation that replaces one sentence by\nanother in a belief set. It is an operation with two variables, such\nthat \\([p/q]\\) replaces \\(p\\) by \\(q\\). Hence,\n\\(K[p/q]\\) is a belief set that contains\n\\(q\\) but not \\(p\\). \nReplacement aims both at the removal of a sentence \\(p\\) and the\naddition of a sentence \\(q\\). This amounts to two success\nconditions, \\(p \\not\\in K[p/q]\\) and\n\\(q \\in K[p/q]\\). However, these\ntwo conditions cannot both be satisfied without exception. First, just\nas for belief contraction, an exception must be made from the first of\nthem in the case when \\(p\\) is a tautology and so cannot be\nremoved. Secondly, the two conditions are not compatible in cases when\n\\(q\\) logically implies \\(p\\). This can be dealt with by\nextending the exception that is provided for in the Success postulate\nfor contraction from cases when \\(p \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\) to cases\nwhen \\(p \\in \\Cn(\\{q\\})\\). This gives rise to the\nfollowing two success conditions: \nContractive success:\nIf \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(\\{q\\})\\), then \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(K[p/q]\\)). \nRevision success:\n \\(q \\in K[p/q]\\) \nReplacement can be used as a kind of “Sheffer stroke” for\nbelief revision, i.e. as an operation in terms of which the other\noperations can be defined. Contraction by \\(p\\) can be defined as\n\\(K[p/\\smtop]\\) and revision by \\(p\\) as \\(K[\\smbot/p]\\), where \\(\\smbot\\)\nis falsum and \\(\\smtop\\) is tautology. Provided that the unperformable\nsuboperation of removing the tautology \\(\\smtop\\) is treated as an empty\nsuboperation, expansion by \\(p\\) can be defined as\n\\(K[\\smtop/p]\\). \nIf the belief set \\(K\\) has a finite base, then it can be represented\nby a single sentence, namely the conjunction \\(k\\) of all the elements\nof its base. This means that the revision \\(K* p\\) of a belief set by\na sentence can be replaced by a revision \\(k* p\\) of a sentence by\nanother sentence. If this revision is non-prioritized, we may treat\n\\(k\\) and \\(p\\) equally, so that \\(k* p = p* k\\). Such an operation\ncan be described as the merging of two belief representations. It can\nrepresent a process of conflict resolution through selective\ncombination of information from two agents or sources. This operation\ncan also be generalized to the merge of several elements, representing\nefforts to combine information from several agents or sources\n(Konieczny and Pino Pérez 2011). \nBy multiple contraction is meant the simultaneous contraction of more\nthan one sentence. Similarly, multiple revision is revision by more\nthan one sentence. \nThere are two major types of multiple contraction. In package\ncontraction, all elements of the input set are retracted: they\nhave to go in a package. In choice contraction it suffices to\nremove at least one of them. Hence, the success conditions for the two\ntypes of multiple contraction are as follows: \nPackage success:\nIf \\(B\\cap \\Cn(\\varnothing) = \\varnothing\\) then \\(B\\cap \\Cn(A\\div B)\n= \\varnothing\\) \nChoice success:\nIf \\(B\\) is not a subset of \\(\\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(B\\) is not\neither a subset of \\(\\Cn(A\\div B)\\). \nPartial meet contraction and kernel contraction can both be\ngeneralized fairly straight-forwardly to both package and choice\nvariants of multiple contraction. \nThe construction of package revision gives rise to an interesting\nextension of the notion of negation. The reason why contraction by\n\\(\\neg p\\) is performed as a suboperation of revision by\n\\(p\\) is that \\(p\\) can be consistently added to a set if\nand only if it does not imply \\(\\neg p\\). It turns out that (in a\nlogic satisfying compactness) a set \\(B\\) can be consistently\nadded to another set if and only if this other set does not contain\nany element of the set \\(\\neg B\\), that is defined as\nfollows: \nNegation of a set:\n\\(p \\in \\neg B\\) if and only if \\(p\\) is either a negation of an\nelement of \\(B\\cup \\{\\smtop\\}\\) or a disjunction of negations of\nelements of \\(B\\cup \\{\\smtop\\}\\).\n \nTherefore multiple revision can be defined from (package) multiple\ncontraction and expansion via a generalized Levi identity: \nMost of the major AGM-related contraction operations have been\ngeneralized to multiple contraction: multiple partial meet contraction\n(Hansson 1989, Fuhrmann and Hansson 1994, Li 1998), multiple kernel\ncontraction (Fermé et al. 2003), multiple specified\nmeet contraction (Hansson 2010), and a multiple version of\nGrove’s sphere system (Reis and Fermé 2011, Fermé\nand Reis 2011). \nMost models of belief change are deterministic in the sense\nthat given a belief set and an input, the resulting belief set is\nwell-determined. There is no scope for chance in selecting the new\nbelief set. Clearly, this is not a realistic feature, but it makes the\nmodels much simpler and easier to handle, not least from a\ncomputational point of view. In indeterministic belief\nchange, the subjection of a specified belief set to a specified input\nhas more than one admissible outcome. \nIndeterministic operations can be constructed as sets of deterministic\noperations. Hence, given three revision operations \\(* ,\n* '\\) and \\(* ''\\) the set \\(\\{*\\), \\(* '\\),\n\\(* ''\\)\\(\\}\\)\ncan be used as an indeterministic\noperation. The success condition is simply: \nLindström and Rabinowicz (1991) constructed indeterministic\ncontraction by giving up the assumption that epistemic entrenchment\nsatisfies connectedness. This resulted in Grove’s sphere systems\nwith “fallbacks” that are not linearly ordered but still\nall include the original belief set. \nBelief revision theory has been almost exclusively developed within\nthe framework of classical sentential (truth-functional) logic. The\ninclusion of non-truthfunctional expressions into the language has\ninteresting and indeed drastic effects. In particular, this applies to\nconditional sentences. \nMany types of conditional sentences, such as counterfactual\nconditionals, cannot be adequately expressed with truth-functional\nimplication (material implication). Several formal interpretations of\nconditional sentences have been proposed. One of them, namely the\nRamsey test, is particularly well suited to the formal\nframework of belief revision. It is based on a suggestion by F. P.\nRamsey that has been further developed by Robert Stalnaker and others\n(Stalnaker 1968). The basic idea is that “if \\(p\\) then\n\\(q\\)” is taken to be believed if and only if \\(q\\)\nwould be believed after revising the present belief state by\n\\(p\\). Let \\(p\\Rightarrow q\\) denote “if \\(p\\)\nthen \\(q\\)”, or more precisely: “if \\(p\\) were\nthe case, then \\(q\\) would be the case”. In order to treat\nconditional statements on par with statements about actual facts, they\nwill have to be included in the belief set, thus: \nThe Ramsey test:\n \\((p\\Rightarrow q) \\in K\\) if and only if \\(q \\in K* p\\).\n \nHowever, inclusion in the belief set of conditionals that satisfy the\nRamsey test will require radical changes in the logic of belief\nchange. As one example of this, contraction cannot then satisfy the\ninclusion postulate \\((K\\div p \\subseteq K)\\).\nThe reason for this is that contraction typically provides support for\nconditional sentences that were not supported by the original belief\nstate. This can be seen from the following example: \nIf I give up my belief that John is mentally retarded, then I gain\nsupport for the conditional sentence “If John has lived 30 years\nin London, then John understands the English language.”\n \nA famous impossibility theorem by Peter Gärdenfors (1986, 1987)\nshows that the Ramsey test is incompatible with a set of plausible\npostulates for revision. Several solutions to the impossibility\ntheorem have been put forward. One option is to reject the Ramsey test\nas a criterion for the validity of conditional sentences (Rott 1986).\nAnother, proposed by Isaac Levi, is to accept the test as a criterion\nof validity but deny that such conditional sentences should be\nincluded in the belief set when they are valid (Levi 1988.\nArló-Costa 1995. Arló-Costa and Levi 1996). Several\nother proposals have been put forward. However, it is fair to say that\noperations of AGM-style belief change have not yet been constructed\nthat are generally recognized as able to deal adequately with\nconditional or modal sentences. \nAn operation of change can raise or lower the position of a sentence\nin the ordering without affecting the belief set (but affecting how\nthe belief state responds to new inputs). An operation of\nimprovement, as proposed by Konieczny and Pérez (2008)\nincreases the plausibility of a non-believed sentence \\(p\\) by\nmoving some of the \\(p\\)-worlds to a higher position in the\npreference ordering of worlds. Even if such a change does not lead to\n\\(p\\) becoming a belief, its acceptance in later, additional\noperations can be facilitated.  \nAn operation of change can be so constructed that it adjusts the\nposition of the input sentence in an ordering to be the same as that\nof a reference sentence. This means that two sentences have to be\nspecified in the input: the (input) sentence to be moved and the\n(reference) sentence indicating its new position. Hans Rott (2007,\nOther Internet Resources) called such operators two-dimensional. John\nCantwell (1997) classified them as raising or\nlowering, depending on the direction of change. (See also\nFermé and Rott 2004 and Rott 2009.) \nThere are close parallels between changes in norms and changes in\nbeliefs. In order to apply a norm system with conflicting norms to a\nparticular situation, some of the norms may have to be ignored. The\nproblem how to prioritize among conflicting norms is similar to the\nselection of sentences for removal in belief contraction (Hansson and\nMakinson 1997). The AGM model was in fact partly the outcome of\nattempts to formalize changes in norms rather than beliefs\n(Alchourrón and Makinson 1981). In spite of this, authors who\napply the AGM model to norms have found it in need of rather extensive\nmodifications to make it suitable for that purpose. Hence, in their\nmodel of changes in legislation, Governatori and Rotolo (2010)\nintroduced an explicit representation of time in order to account for\nphenomena such as retroactivity. \nA model of changes in preferences can be obtained by replacing the\nstandard AGM language by sentences of the form \\(p \\ge q\\) (“\\(p\\) is at least as good as\n\\(q\\)”) and their truth-functional combinations. The\nadoption of a new preference can then take the form of revision by\nsuch a preference sentence. Partial meet contraction can be used, but\nsome modifications of the AGM model seem to be necessary in\napplications to preferences (Hansson 1995, Lang and van der Torre\n2008, Grüne-Yanoff and Hansson 2009). \nThe preceding sections have only dealt with changes of one and the\nsame belief set or belief base. This is clearly a severe limitation. A\nrealistic model of belief change should allow for repeated (iterated)\nchanges, such as\n\\(K\\div p\\div q* r* s\\div t\\ldots\\) In other words, operations are needed that can\ncontract or revise any belief set (belief base) by any sentence. Such\noperations are called global, in contrast to local\noperations that are defined only for a single specified set. \nAn obvious way to obtain a global operation of partial meet\ncontraction would be to use the same selection function for all\nsets to be contracted. However, with the standard way to obtain a\npartial meet contraction from a selection function, this is not\npossible, due to the way selection functions treat the empty set. The\nway selection functions have been defined, if \\(A\\bot p =\n\\varnothing\\), then \\(\\gamma(A\\bot p ) = \\{A\\}\\). As a consequence of\nthis, if \\(\\gamma\\) is a selection function for \\(A\\), and \\(A \\ne\nB\\), then \\(\\gamma\\) is not a selection function for \\(B\\). For let\n\\(A\\bot p = B\\bot p = \\varnothing\\). For \\(\\gamma\\) to be a function\nit must be the case that \\(\\gamma(A\\bot p) = \\gamma(B\\bot p)\\).  For\n\\(\\gamma\\) to be a selection function for \\(A\\) it must be case that\n\\(\\gamma(A\\bot p) = \\{A\\}\\), and in order for it to be a selection\nfunction for \\(B\\) it must be the case that \\(\\gamma(B\\bot p) =\n\\{B\\}\\). Since \\(A \\ne B\\), this is impossible. \nThis can be solved if we rewrite the definition of partial meet\ncontraction as follows: \nAlternative definition of partial meet contraction: \n\\((1')\\) \\(\\gamma(K\\bot p) \\subseteq K\\bot p\\), and if \\(K\\bot p \\ne \\varnothing\\), then \\(\\gamma(K\\bot p) \\ne \\varnothing\\). \n\\((2')\\) \\(K\\div p = \\bigcap \\gamma(K\\bot p)\\), unless\n\\(\\gamma(K\\bot p) = \\varnothing\\), in which case\n\\(K\\div p = K\\). \nAs applied to a single belief set \\(K\\), this definition is\nequivalent with the original definition. Notably, it yields the same\nresult as the original definition even in the limiting case when\n\\(p\\) is a tautology, but it avoids using the selection function\nin this limiting case. With this, slightly adjusted, definition, one\nand the same selection function can be used for all belief sets, and\nconsequently we can construct iterated change using only one,\nAGM-style, selection function. Since partial meet revision is\ndefinable from partial meet contraction via the Levi identity, this\nmeans that we have global operations for both contraction and\nrevision. This construction is so general that it does not impose any\nnew properties on contraction or revision, i.e. no properties in\naddition to the usual AGM postulates (Hansson 2012).  \nHowever, most of the discussion on iterated change has been based on\nthe assumption that such additional properties are plausible and\nindeed desirable. The so-called Darwiche-Pearl postulates for revision\nhave had a central role in these discussions (Darwiche and Pearl\n1997): \nIf \\(q \\vdash p\\), then \\((K * p) * q = K * q\\).\n(DP1) \nIf \\(q \\vdash \\neg p\\), then \\((K * p) * q = K * q\\).\n(DP2) \nIf \\(K * q \\vdash p\\), then \\((K * p) * q \\vdash p\\). (DP3) \nIf \\(K * q\\) ⊬ \\(\\neg p\\), then\n\\((K * p) * q\\) ⊬ \\(\\neg p\\) (DP4)  \nThe Darwiche-Pearl postulates express an intuition about the epistemic\nordering of possible worlds, namely that when we revise by a sentence\n\\(p\\), then the ordering among \\(p\\)-worlds should be\nunchanged, and so should the ordering among \\(\\neg p\\)-worlds.\nThe change takes the form of a shift of the relative positions of\nthese two parts of the original ordering of worlds. A large number of\nproposals for such shifts have been put forward, but opinions differ\nwidely on the adequacy of these proposals. \nAbhaya Nayak (1994) has proposed a model of iterated belief change in\nwhich both the belief states and the inputs are binary relations that\nsatisfy the standard entrenchment postulates except Minimality. Inputs\nof this type may be seen as “fragments” of belief states,\nto be incorporated into the previous belief state. In the same vein,\nEduardo Fermé and Hans Rott (2004) have investigated belief\nrevision with inputs of the more general form: “accept\n\\(q\\) with a degree of plausibility that at least equals that of\n\\(p\\)”. They call this revision by comparison.\nBelief states are represented by entrenchment orderings. Hence, from\nan entrenchment ordering \\(\\le\\) and such a generalized input a new\nentrenchment ordering \\(\\le '\\) is obtained that contains the\ninformation needed to construct the new belief set.  \nIn spite of the dominant position of the AGM model and its close\nvariants, several other formal models of belief changes have been\nproposed. \nIn belief revision theory, the focus is on consistency rather than\ntruthfulness. In contrast, learning theory is devoted to induction and\nthe attainment of true beliefs. A research question is represented as\na partition of the set of possible worlds, i.e. a distribution of all\npossible worlds into non-overlapping sets. The research question has\nbeen fully answered when it is known which of these partitions\ncontains the actual world. Information received by the agent\nsuccessively narrows down the set of partitions that may contain it.\nThe central issue is how to construct an inductive strategy, i.e. a\nstrategy for which investigations to perform and in what order, and\nhow to interpret them (Kelly 1999). Although this problem has\nconnections with belief revision, it has been shown that operations\nsatisfying the standard AGM postulates do not provide a credible\naccount of the inductive processes studied in learning theory. (Genin\nand Kelly forthcoming) \nDynamic doxastic logic (DDL) was introduced by Krister Segerberg to\nrepresent an agent who has opinions about the external world and\nchanges these opinions upon receipt of new information. DDL makes use\nof epistemic modal operators of the type introduced by Hintikka\n(1962). The sentence \\(B_i p\\) denotes\nthat the individual \\(i\\) believes that \\(p\\). When only one\nagent is under consideration, the subscript can be deleted, and the\noperator \\(B\\) can be read “it is believed that” or\n“the agent believes that” (Segerberg 1995, p. 536).  \nThe formula \\(Bp\\) in DDL differs from the expression \\(p \\in K\\) of AGM in being a sentence in the same language as\n\\(p\\). This makes it possible to express in the object language\nthat a sentence is believed. In this way, Segerberg attempted to\ndevelop belief revision “as a generalization of ordinary\nHintikka type doxastic logic”, whereas in contrast “AGM is\nnot really logic; it is a theory about theories” (Segerberg\n1999, p. 136). In the DDL framework it is possible to express beliefs\nabout beliefs. The sentence “\\(i\\) believes that \\(i\\)\ndoes not believe that \\(p\\)” can be expressed as\n\\(B_i \\neg B_i p\\), whereas there is\nno way to express it in the AGM framework. \\(((p \\not\\in K_i) \\in K_i\\) is not a\nwell-formed formula.) \nIn DDL, belief revision operations (expansion, revision, and\ncontraction) are expressed with dynamic modal operators, similar to\nthose used for program execution. (This element of DDL was present\nalso in previous publications by several authors. See Fuhrmann 1991;\nde Rijke 1994; van Benthem 1989 and 1995.) Segerberg used the\nfollowing notation: \nThe combination of these two elements, belief operators and dynamic\noperators, results in a framework that differs from AGM in important\nways. (Leitgeb and Segerberg 2007, 169) \nLargely similar systems have been developed under the name of Dynamic\nEpistemic Logic, DEL (Plaza 1989; Baltag et al. 1998; van Ditmarsch et\nal. 2007; see the entry on\n dynamic-epistemic logic).\n A major difference between DDL and DEL is that the latter has mostly\nbeen studied in multiagent contexts. The most studied dynamics is that\nof the public announcement of some sentence (van Ditmarsch et al.\n2007).  \nDescriptor revision (Hansson 2014, forthcoming) is based on two major\nformal constructions. One of them is a metalinguistic belief predicate\n\\(\\mathfrak{B}\\) that is applied to sentences of the object language.\n\\(\\mathfrak{B}p\\) denotes that the sentence \\(p\\) is believed,\n\\(\\neg \\mathfrak{B}p\\) that it is not believed, and\n\\(\\mathfrak{B}p\\vee \\mathfrak{B}q\\) that either \\(p\\) or\n\\(q\\) is believed. Such sentences can be used to express the\nsuccess conditions of belief change operations. Thus\n\\(\\mathfrak{B}p\\) is the success condition of revision by\n\\(p\\), \\(\\neg \\mathfrak{B}p\\) that of contraction by \\(p\\)\nand \\(\\{\\neg \\mathfrak{B}p,\\neg \\mathfrak{B}q\\}\\) that of\nmultiple contraction by \\(\\{p,q\\}\\). Due to the\nversatility of descriptors we only need one operation, denoted\n\\(\\circ\\). Hence, \\(K\\circ \\mathfrak{B}p\\) represents\nrevision by \\(p\\) and \\(K \\circ \\neg \\mathfrak{B}p\\)\ncontraction by \\(p\\).  \nThe other major formal construction is a choice function (selection\nfunction) that operates directly on the set of potential outcomes of\nan operation. Hence, the operation\n\\(K \\circ \\mathfrak{B}p\\) is performed by choosing one\namong the potential belief sets that contain \\(p\\) (presumably\nthat which is most choiceworthy, or closest at hand). Operations based\non these principles have been axiomatically characterized. Notably,\nthe recovery postulate that creates problems in the AGM framework does\nnot hold in the descriptor revision framework. The application of a\nchoice function to potential belief outcomes is arguably more\nplausible than its application to possible worlds or remainders, since\nthe latter two entities are logically infinite (if the language is\nso), and therefore cognitively inaccessible. \nThe AGM model and other logical frameworks for belief revision are\nbased on a dichotomous approach to belief: either something is\nbelieved or it is not, in either case without any gradations. Beliefs\ncan be be more or less easily given up, and non-beliefs can be more or\nless easily turned into beliefs, but the very act of believing does\nnot admit of degrees. In contrast, probabilistic models of belief,\nusually based on some form of subjective Bayesianism, admit all\ndegrees between the strongest belief and the strongest disbelief.\nDichotomous and probabilistic models represent different features of\nbelief systems. It has proved to be difficult to construct a\nreasonably manageable model that covers both the logic-related and the\nprobabilistic properties of belief change. These difficulties are\nclosely connected with the lottery and preface paradoxes (Kyburg 1961;\nMakinson 1965). \nHowever, belief revision theory has turned out to be useful in dealing\nwith the problematic limiting case of conditional probabilities with a\ncondition that has probability zero. Insights from belief revision\ntheory have been used in the construction of non-standard models of\nprobabilities in which conditionalization can be performed also in\nthis limiting case (Makinson 2011).
