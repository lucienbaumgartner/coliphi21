His work had a vast range, encompassing \nanalysis, algebra, number theory, topology, differential geometry, \nspacetime theory, quantum mechanics, and the foundations of \nmathematics. His scientific writing is informed by a rare literary \nand artistic sensibility—in his words, “Expression and \nshape mean almost more to me than knowledge itself”. He was \nunusual among scientists and mathematicians of his time in being \nattracted to idealist philosophy: his idealist leanings can be seen \nparticularly in his work on the foundations of mathematics. In his \nyouth, Kant’s doctrines made a great impression on him; later he was \nstirred both by Fichte’s metaphysical idealism and by Husserlian \nphenomenology. Although Weyl came to question the certainties claimed\nby idealism, he cleaved always to the primacy of intuition he had \nfirst learned from Kant, and to its expression by Fichte as the \n“inner light” of individual consciousness.\n\n\n\nHermann Weyl was born on 9 November 1885 in the small town of \nElmshorn near Hamburg. In 1904 he entered Göttingen University, \nwhere his teachers included Hilbert, Klein and Minkowski. Weyl was \nparticularly impressed with Hilbert’s lectures on number theory and \nresolved to study everything he had written. Hilbert’s work on \nintegral equations became the focus of Weyl’s (1908) doctoral \ndissertation, written under Hilbert’s direction. In this and in \nsubsequent papers Weyl made important contributions to the theory of \nself-adjoint operators. Virtually all of Weyl’s many publications \nduring his stay in Göttingen until 1913 dealt with integral \nequations and their applications. \n\nAfter Weyl’s (1910b) habilitation, he became a Privatdozent and was \nthereby entitled to give lectures at the University of \nGöttingen. Weyl chose to lecture on Riemann’s theory of \nalgebraic functions during the winter semester of 1911–12. \nThese lectures became the basis of Weyl’s (1913) first book Die \nIdee der Riemannschen Fläche (The Concept of a Riemann \nSurface). This work, in which function theory, geometry and \ntopology are unified, constitutes the first modern and comprehensive \ntreatment of Riemann surfaces. The work also contains the first \nconstruction of an abstract manifold. Emphasizing that the `points of\nthe manifold’ can be quite arbitrary, Weyl based his definition of a \ngeneral two-dimensional manifold or surface on an extension of the \nneighbourhood axioms that Hilbert (1902) had proposed for the \ndefinition of a plane. The work is indicative of Weyl’s exceptional \ngift for harmoniously uniting into a coherent whole a patchwork of \ndistinct mathematical fields. \n\nIn 1913 Weyl was offered, and accepted, a professorship at the \nEidgenössische Technische Hochschule—ETH (Swiss Federal \nInstitute of Technology)—in Zürich. Weyl’s years in \nZürich were extraordinarily productive and resulted in some of \nhis finest work, especially in the foundations of mathematics and \nphysics. When he arrived in Zürich in the fall of 1913, Einstein\nand Grossmann were struggling to overcome a difficulty in their \neffort to provide a coherent mathematical formulation of the general \ntheory of relativity. Like Hilbert, Weyl appreciated the importance \nof a close relationship between mathematics and physics. It was \ntherefore only natural that Weyl should become interested in \nEinstein’s theory and the potential mathematical challenges it might \noffer. Following the outbreak of the First World War, however, in May\n1915 Weyl was called up for military service. But Weyl’s academic \ncareer was interrupted only briefly, since in 1916 he was exempted \nfrom military duties for reasons of health. In the meantime Einstein \nhad accepted an offer from Berlin and had left Zürich in 1914. \nEinstein’s departure had weakened the theoretical physics program at \nthe ETH and (as reported by Frei and Stammbach (1992, 26) the \nadministration hoped that Weyl’s presence would alleviate the \nsituation. But Weyl needed no external prompting to work in, and to \nteach, theoretical physics: his interest in the subject in general \nand, above all, in the theory of relativity, gave him more than \nsufficient motivation in that regard. Weyl decided to lecture on the \ngeneral theory of relativity in the summer semester of 1917, and \nthese lectures became the basis of his famous book \nRaum-Zeit-Materie (Space-Time-Matter) of 1918. \n\nDuring 1917–24, Weyl directed his energies equally to the \ndevelopment of the mathematical and philosophical foundations of \nrelativity theory, and to the broader foundations of mathematics. It \nis in these two areas that his philosophical erudition, nourished \nfrom his youth, manifests itself most clearly. The year 1918, the \nsame year in which Space-Time-Matter appeared, also saw the \npublication of Das Kontinuum (The Continuum), a \nwork in which Weyl constructs a new foundation for mathematical \nanalysis free of what he had come to see as fatal flaws in the \nset-theoretic formulation of Cantor and Dedekind. Soon afterwards \nWeyl embraced Brouwer’s mathematical intuitionism; in the early 1920s\nhe published a number of papers elaborating on and defending the \nintuitionistic standpoint in the foundations of mathematics. \n\nIt was also during the first years of the 1920s that Weyl came to \nappreciate the power and utility of group theory, initially in \nconnection with his work on the solution to the Riemann-Helmholtz-Lie\nproblem of space. Weyl analyzed this problem, the \nRaumproblem, in a series of articles and lectures during the\nperiod 1921–23. Weyl (1949b, 400) noted that his interest in \nthe philosophical foundations of the general theory of relativity had\nmotivated his analysis of the representations and invariants of the \ncontinuous groups: \n\nThis newly acquired appreciation of group theory led Weyl to what he \nhimself considered his greatest work in mathematics, a general theory\nof the representations and invariants of the classical Lie groups \n(Weyl 1924a, 1924f, 1925, 1926a, 1926b, 1926c). Later Weyl (1939) \nwrote a book, The Classical Groups: Their Invariants and \nRepresentations, in which he returned to the theory of \ninvariants and representations of semisimple Lie groups. In this work\nhe realized his ambition “to derive the decisive results for \nthe most important of these groups by direct algebraic construction, \nin particular for the full group of all non-singular linear \ntransformations and for the orthogonal group.” \n\nWeyl applied his work in group theory and his earlier work in \nanalysis and spectral theory to the new theory of quantum mechanics. \nWeyl’s mathematical analysis of the foundations of quantum mechanics \nshowed that regularities in a physical theory are most fruitfully \nunderstood in terms of symmetry groups. Weyl’s (1928) book \nGruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik (Group Theory and \nQuantum Mechanics) deals not only with the theory of quantum \nmechanics but also with relativistic quantum electrodynamics. In this\nwork Weyl also presented a very early analysis of discrete symmetries\nwhich later stimulated Dirac to predict the existence of the positron\nand the antiproton. \n\nDuring his years in Zürich Weyl received, and turned down, \nnumerous offers of professorships by other \nuniversities—including an invitation in 1923 to become Felix \nKlein’s successor at Göttingen. It was only in 1930 that he \nfinally accepted the call to become Hilbert’s successor there. His \nsecond stay in Göttingen was to be brief. Repelled by Nazism, \n“deeply revolted,” as he later wrote, “by the \nshame which this regime had brought to the German name,” he \nleft Germany in 1933 to accept an offer of permanent membership of \nthe newly founded Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Before \nhis departure for Princeton he published The Open World \n(1932); his tenure there saw the publication of Mind and \nNature (1934), the aforementioned The Classical Groups \n(1939), Algebraic Theory of Numbers (1940), Meromorphic \nFunctions and Analytic Curves (1943), Philosophy of \nMathematics and Natural Science (1949; an enlarged English \nversion of a 1927 work Philosophie der Mathematik und \nNaturwissenschaften), and Symmetry (1952). In 1951 he \nformally retired from the Institute, remaining as an emeritus member \nuntil his death, spending half his time there and half in \nZürich. He died in Zürich suddenly, of a heart attack, on 9\nDecember 1955. \n\nWeyl was first and foremost a mathematician, and certainly not a \n“professional” philosopher. But as a German intellectual \nof his time it was natural for him to regard philosophy as a pursuit \nto be taken seriously. In Weyl’s case, unusually even for a German \nmathematician, it was idealist philosophy that from the beginning \nplayed a significant role in his thought. Kant, Husserl, Fichte, and,\nlater, Leibniz, were at various stages major influences on Weyl’s \nphilosophical thinking. As a schoolboy Weyl had been impressed by \nKant’s “Critique of Pure Reason.” He was especially taken\nwith Kant’s doctrine that space and time are not inherent in the \nobjects of the world, existing as such and independently of our \nawareness, but are, rather, forms of our intuition As he reports in \nInsight and Reflection, (Weyl 1955), his youthful enthusiasm for Kant\ncrumbled soon after he entered Göttingen University in 1904. \nThere he read Hilbert’s Foundations of Geometry, a tour-de-force of \nthe axiomatic method, in comparison to which Kant’s “bondage to\nEuclidean geometry” now appeared to him naïve. After this \nphilosophical reverse he lapsed into an indifferent positivism for a \nwhile. But in 1912 he found a new and exciting source of \nphilosophical enlightenment in Husserl’s \n phenomenology.[1]\n It was also at about this time that Fichte’s metaphysical idealism \ncame to “capture his imagination.” Although Weyl later \nquestioned idealist philosophy, and became dissatisfied with \nphenomenology, he remained faithful throughout his life to the \nprimacy of intuition that he had first learned from Kant, and to the \nirreducibility of individual consciousness that had been confirmed in\nhis view by Fichte and Husserl. \n\nWeyl never provided a systematic account of his philosophical views,\nand sorting out his overall philosophical position is no easy matter.\nDespite the importance of intuition and individual consciousness in\nWeyl’s philosophical outlook, it would nevertheless be inexact to\ndescribe his outlook as being that of a “pure” idealist,\nsince certain “realist” touches seem also to be present,\nin his approach to physics, at least. His metaphysics appears to rest\non three elements, the first two of which may be considered\n“idealist”, and the third “realist”: these\nare, respectively, the Ego or “I”, the (Conscious) Other\nor “Thou”, and the external or “objective”\nworld.  \n\nIt is the first of these constituents, the Ego, to which Weyl \nascribes primacy. Indeed, in Weyl’s words, \n\nThe Ego alone has direct access to the given, that is, to the raw \nmaterials of the existent which are presented to consciousness with \nan immediacy at once inescapable and irreducible. The Ego is singular\nin that, from its own standpoint, it is unique. But in an act of \nself-reflection, through grasping (in Weyl’s words) “what I am \nfor myself”, the Ego comes to recognize that it has a \nfunction, namely as “conscious-existing carrier of the\nworld of phenomena.” It is then but a short step for the Ego to\ntranscend its singularity through the act of defining an \n“ego” to be an entity performing that same function \nfor itself. That is, an ego is precisely what I am for \nmyself (in other words, what the Ego is for itself)—again a \n“conscious-existing carrier of the world of \nphenomena”—and yet other than myself. \n“Thou” is the term the Ego uses to address, and so to \nidentify, an ego in this sense. “Thou” is thus the Ego \ngeneralized, the Ego refracted through itself. The Ego grasps that it\nexists within a world of Thous, that is, within a world of other Egos\nsimilar to itself. While the Ego has, of necessity, no direct access \nto any Thou, it can, through analogy and empathy, grasp what it is to\nbe Thou, a conscious being like oneself. By that very fact the Ego \nrecognizes in the Thou the same luminosity it sees in itself. \n\nThe relationship of the Ego with the external world, the realm of \n“objective” reality, is of an entirely different nature. \nThere is no analogy that the Ego can draw—as it can with the \nThou—between itself and the external world, since that world \n(presumably) lacks consciousness. The external world is radically \nother, and opaque to the \n Ego[2].\n Like Kant’s noumenal realm, the external world is outside the \nimmediacy of consciousness; it is, in a word, transcendent. \nSince this transcendent world is not directly accessible to the Ego, \nas far as the latter is concerned the existence of that world must \narise through postulation, “a matter of metaphysics, \nnot a judgment but an act of acknowledgment or \n belief.”[3]\n Indeed, according to Weyl, it is not strictly necessary for the Ego \nto postulate the existence of such a world, even given the existence \nof a world of Thous: \n\nFor as long as I do not proceed beyond what is given, or, more \nexactly, what is given at the moment, there is no need for the \nsubstructure of an objective world. Even if I include memory and in \nprinciple acknowledge it as valid testimony, if I furthermore accept \nas data the contents of the consciousness of others on equal terms \nwith my own, thus opening myself to the mystery of intersubjective \ncommunication, I would still not have to proceed as we actually do, \nbut might ask instead for the ‘transformations’ which \nmediate between the images of the several consciousnesses. Such a \npresentation would fit in with Leibniz’s monadology. (Weyl 1949, \n117.) \n\nBut once the existence of the transcendent world is postulated, its \nopacity to the Ego can be partly overcome by constructing a \nrepresentation of it through the use of symbols, the \nprocedure called by Weyl symbolic construction, (or \nconstructive \n cognition)[4]\n and which he regarded as the cornerstone of scientific explanation. \nHe outlines the process as follows (Weyl 1934, 53): \n\nWeyl’s procedure thus amounts to the following. In step 1, a given \nconfiguration is subjected to variation. One then identifies those \nfeatures of the configuration that remain unchanged under the \nvariation—the invariant features; these are in turn, \nthrough a process of reification, deemed to be properties of an \nunchanging substrate—the “things themselves”. It is\nprecisely the invariance of such features that renders them (as well \nas the “things themselves”) capable of being represented \nby the “time resisting” symbols Weyl introduces in step \n2. As (written) symbols these are communicable without temporal \ndistortion and can be subjected to unrestricted manipulation without \ndegradation. It is the flexibility conferred thereby which enables \nthe use of symbols to be conformable with reality. Nevertheless (step\n3) symbols are not haphazardly created in response to immediate \nstimuli; they are introduced, rather, in a structured, yet freely \nchosen manner which reflects the idea of an underlying \norder—the “one real world”—about which not \neverything is, or can be, known—it is, like the future, \n“open towards infinity”. Weyl observes that the \nreification implicit in the procedure of symbolic construction leads \ninevitably to its iteration, for “the transition from step to \nstep is made necessary by the fact that the objects at one step \nreveal themselves as manifestations of a higher reality, the reality \nof the next step” (Weyl (1934), 32–33). But in the end \n“systematic scientific explanation will finally reverse the \norder: first it will erect its symbolical world by itself, without \nany reference, then, skipping all intermediate steps, try to describe\nwhich symbolical configurations lead to which data of \nconsciousness” (ibid.). In this way the symbolic world\nbecomes (mistakenly) identified with the transcendent world. \n\nIt is symbolic construction which, in Weyl’s vision, allows us access\nto the “objective” world presumed to underpin our \nimmediate perceptions; indeed, Weyl holds that the objective world, \nbeing beyond the grasp (the “lighted circle”) of \nintuition, can only be presented to us in symbolic \n form[5].\n We can see a double dependence on the Ego in Weyl’s idea of symbolic \nconstruction to get hold of an objective world beyond the mental. For\nnot only is that world “constructed” by the Ego, but the \nmaterials of construction, the symbols themselves, as signs intended \nto convey meaning, have no independent existence beyond their \ngraspability by a consciousness. By their very nature these symbols \ncannot point directly to an external world (even given an unshakable \nbelief in the existence of that world) lying beyond consciousness. \nWeyl’s metaphysical triad thus reduces to what might be called a \npolarized dualism, with the mental (I, Thou) as the primary,\nindependent pole and objective reality as a secondary, dependent \n pole[6].\n  \n\n\nIn Weyl’s view mathematics simply lies – as it did for Brouwer\n– within the Ego’s “lighted circle of intuition” and\nso is, in principle at least, completely presentable to that\nintuition. But the nature of physics is more complicated. To the\nextent that physics is linked to the transcendent world of objective\nreality, it cannot arise as the direct object of intuition, but must,\nlike the transcendent world itself, be presented in symbolic form;\nmore exactly, as the result of a process of symbolic construction. It\nis this which, in Weyl’s vision, allows us access to to the\n\"objective\" world presumed to underpin our immediate perceptions.  \n\nWeyl’s conviction that the objective world can only be presented to us\nthrough symbolic construction may serve to explain his apparently\nuntroubled attitude towards the highly counterintuitive nature of\nquantum theory. Indeed, the claims of numerous physicists that the\nquantum microworld is accessible to us only through abstract\nmathematical description provides a vindication of Weyl’s thesis that\nobjective reality cannot be grasped directly, but only through the\nmediation of symbols.  In his later years Weyl attempted to enlarge his metaphysical triad \n(I, Thou, objective world) to a tetrad, by a process of completion, \nas it were, to embrace the “godhead that lives in impenetrable \nsilence”, the objective counterpart of the Ego, which had been \nsuggested to him by his study of Eckhart. But this effort was to remain\nuncompleted. \n\n\n\nDuring his long philosophical voyage Weyl stopped at a number of \nports of call: in his youth, Kantianism and positivism; then \nHusserlian phenomenological idealism; later Brouwerian intuitionism \nand finally a kind of theological existentialism. But apart from his \nbrief flirtation with positivism (itself, as he says, the result of a\ndisenchantment with Kant’s “bondage to Euclidean \ngeometry”), Weyl’s philosophical orientation remained in its \nessence idealist (even granting the significant realist elements \nmentioned above). Nevertheless, while he continued to acknowledge the\nimportance of phenomenology, his remarks in Insight and \nReflection indicate that he came to regard Husserl’s doctrine as\nlacking in two essential respects: first, it failed to give due \nrecognition to the (construction of) transcendent external world, \nwith which Weyl, in his capacity as a natural scientist, was \nconcerned; secondly, and perhaps in Weyl’s view even more seriously, \nit failed to engage with the enigma of selfhood: the fact that I am \nthe person I am. Grappling with the first problem led Weyl to \nidentify symbolic construction as providing sole access to objective \nreality, a position which brought him close to Cassirer in certain \nrespects; while the second problem seems to have led him to \nexistentialism and even, through his reading of Eckhart, to a kind of\nreligious mysticism. \n\nTowards the end of his Address on the Unity of Knowledge, \ndelivered at the 1954 Columbia University bicentennial celebrations, \nWeyl enumerates what he considers to be the essential constituents of\nknowledge. At the top of his \n list[7]\n comes \n\nIn particular Weyl held to the view that intuition, or \ninsight—rather than proof—furnishes the\nultimate foundation of mathematical knowledge. Thus in his \nDas Kontinuum of 1918 he says: \n\nWeyl’s idealism naturally inclined him to the view that the ultimate \nbasis of his own subject, mathematics, must be found in the \nintuitively given as opposed to the transcendent. Nevertheless, he \nrecognized that it would be unreasonable to require all mathematical \nknowledge to possess intuitive immediacy. In Das Kontinuum, \nfor example, he says: \n\nNevertheless, Weyl felt that this fact, inescapable as it might be, \ncould not justify extending the bounds of mathematics to embrace \nnotions, such as the actual infinite, which cannot be given fully in \nintuition even in principle. He held, rather, that such extensions of\nmathematics into the transcendent are warranted only by the fact that\nmathematics plays an indispensable role in the physical sciences, in \nwhich intuitive evidence is necessarily transcended. As he says in \nThe Open \n World[8]:\n  \n\nIn Consistency in Mathematics (1929), Weyl characterized the\nmathematical method as \n\nThe problem of identifying the limits on constructing “the \npossible” in this sense occupied Weyl a great deal. He was \nparticularly concerned with the concept of the mathematical \ninfinite, which he believed to elude \n“construction” in the naive set-theoretical sense \n [10].\n Again to quote a passage from Das Kontinuum: \n\nBut still, as Weyl attests towards the end of The Open \nWorld, “the demand for totality and the metaphysical \nbelief in reality inevitably compel the mind to represent the \ninfinite as closed being by symbolical construction”. The \nconception of the completed infinite, even if nonsensical, is \ninescapable. \n\nAnother mathematical “possible” to which Weyl gave a \ngreat deal of thought is the continuum. During the period \n1918–1921 he wrestled with the problem of providing the \nmathematical continuum—the real number line—with a \nlogically sound formulation. Weyl had become increasingly critical of\nthe principles underlying the set-theoretic construction of the \nmathematical continuum. He had come to believe that the whole \nset-theoretical approach involved vicious \n circles[11]\n to such an extent that, as he says, “every cell (so to speak) \nof this mighty organism is permeated by contradiction.” In \nDas Kontinuum he tries to overcome this by providing \nanalysis with a predicative formulation—not, as \nRussell and Whitehead had attempted, by introducing a hierarchy of \nlogically ramified types, which Weyl seems to have regarded as \nexcessively complicated—but rather by confining the \ncomprehension principle to formulas whose bound variables range over \njust the initial given entities (numbers). Accordingly he restricts \nanalysis to what can be done in terms of natural numbers with the aid\nof three basic logical operations, together with the operation of \nsubstitution and the process of “iteration”, i.e., \nprimitive recursion. Weyl recognized that the effect of this \nrestriction would be to render unprovable many of the central results\nof classical analysis—e.g., Dirichlet’s principle that any \nbounded set of real numbers has a least upper \n bound[12]—but\n he was prepared to accept this as part of the price that must be paid\nfor the security of mathematics. \n\nAs Weyl saw it, there is an unbridgeable gap between intuitively \ngiven continua (e.g. those of space, time and motion) on the one \nhand, and the “discrete” exact concepts of mathematics \n(e.g. that of natural \n number[13])\n on the other. The presence of this chasm meant that the construction \nof the mathematical continuum could not simply be “read \noff” from intuition. It followed, in Weyl’s view, that the \nmathematical continuum must be treated as if it were an element of \nthe transcendent realm, and so, in the end, justified in the same way\nas a physical theory. It was not enough that the mathematical theory \nbe consistent; it must also be reasonable.  \n\nDas Kontinuum embodies Weyl’s attempt at formulating a \ntheory of the continuum which satisfies the first, and, as far as \npossible, the second, of these requirements. In the following \npassages from this work he acknowledges the difficulty of the task: \n\n… the conceptual world of mathematics is so foreign to what \nthe intuitive continuum presents to us that the demand for \ncoincidence between the two must be dismissed as absurd. (Weyl 1987, \n108) \n\n… the continuity given to us immediately by intuition (in the \nflow of time and of motion) has yet to be grasped mathematically as a\ntotality of discrete “stages” in accordance with that \npart of its content which can be conceptualized in an exact way. \n(Ibid., \n 24)[14] \n\nExact time- or space-points are not the ultimate, underlying atomic \nelements of the duration or extension given to us in experience. On \nthe contrary, only reason, which thoroughly penetrates what is \nexperientially given, is able to grasp these exact ideas. And only in\nthe arithmetico- analytic concept of the real number belonging to the\npurely formal sphere do these ideas crystallize into full \ndefiniteness. (Ibid., 94) \n\nWhen our experience has turned into a real process in a real world \nand our phenomenal time has spread itself out over this world and \nassumed a cosmic dimension, we are not satisfied with replacing the \ncontinuum by the exact concept of the real number, in spite of the \nessential and undeniable inexactness arising from what is given. \n(Ibid., 93)  \n\nAs these quotations show, Weyl had come to accept that it was in \nprinciple impossible to furnish the continuum as presented to \nintuition with an exact mathematical formulation : so, with \nreluctance, he lowered his sights. In Das Kontinuum his goal\nwas, first and foremost, to establish the consistency of the\nmathematical theory of the continuum by putting the \narithmetical notion of real number on a firm logical basis. \nOnce this had been achieved, he would then proceed to show that this \ntheory is reasonable by employing it as the foundation for a\nplausible account of continuous process in the objective physical \n world.[15] \n\nIn §6 of Das Kontinuum Weyl presents his conclusions as\nto the relationship between the intuitive and mathematical \ncontinua. He poses the question: Does the mathematical \nframework he has erected provide an adequate representation of \nphysical or temporal continuity as it is actually \nexperienced? In posing this question we can see the continuing \ninfluence of Husserl and phenomenological doctrine. Weyl begins his \ninvestigation by noting that, according to his theory, if one asks \nwhether a given function is continuous, the answer is not fixed once \nand for all, but is, rather, dependent on the extent of the domain of\nreal numbers which have been defined up to the point at which the \nquestion is posed. Thus the continuity of a function must always \nremain provisional; the possibility always exists that a \nfunction deemed continuous now may, with the emergence of \n“new” real numbers, turn out to be discontinuous in \nthe future. \n [16] \n\nTo reveal the discrepancy between this formal account of continuity \nbased on real numbers and the properties of an intuitively given \ncontinuum, Weyl next considers the experience of seeing a pencil \nlying on a table before him throughout a certain time interval. The \nposition of the pencil during this interval may be taken as a \nfunction of the time, and Weyl takes it as a fact of observation that\nduring the time interval in question this function is continuous and \nthat its values fall within a definite range. And so, he says, \n\nTo drive the point home, Weyl focuses attention on the fundamental \ncontinuum of immediately given phenomenal time, that is, as \nhe characterizes it, \n\nIn order to correlate mathematical concepts with phenomenal time in \nthis sense Weyl grants the possibility of introducing a rigidly \npunctate “now” and of identifying and exhibiting the \nresulting temporal points. On the collection of these temporal points\nis defined the relation of earlier than as well as a \ncongruence relation of equality of temporal intervals, the \nbasic constituents of a simple mathematical theory of time. Now Weyl \nobserves that the discrepancy between phenomenal time and the concept\nof real number would vanish if the following pair of conditions could\nbe shown to be satisfied: \n\ncan be constructed arithmetically in pure number theory on the basis \nof our principles of definition, and is therefore a real number in \nour sense. (Ibid., 89) \n\nCondition 2 means that, if we take the time span \\(OE\\) as a \nunit, then each temporal point \\(P\\) is correlated with a \ndefinite real number. In an addendum Weyl also stipulates the \nconverse. \n\nBut can temporal intuition itself provide evidence for the truth or \nfalsity of these two conditions? Weyl thinks not. In fact, he states \nquite categorically that \n\nThe grounds for this assertion are by no means immediately evident, \nbut one gathers from the passages following it that Weyl regards the \nexperienced continuous flow of phenomenal time as \nconstituting an insuperable barrier to the whole enterprise of \nrepresenting the continuum as experienced in terms of individual \npoints, and even to the characterization of “individual \ntemporal point” itself. As he says, \n\nWeyl sums up what he thinks can be affirmed about “objectively \npresented time”—by which he presumably means \n“phenomenal time described in an objective \nmanner”—in the following two assertions, which he claims \napply equally, mutatis mutandis, to every intuitively given \ncontinuum, in particular, to the continuum of spatial extension. \n(Ibid., 92): \n\nThe fact that single points in a true continuum “cannot be \nexhibited” arises, Weyl asserts, from the fact that they are \nnot genuine individuals and so cannot be characterized by their \nproperties. In the physical world they are never defined absolutely, \nbut only in terms of a coordinate system, which, in an arresting \nmetaphor, Weyl describes as “the unavoidable residue of the \neradication of the ego.” This metaphor, which Weyl was to \nemploy more than \n once[17],\n again reflects the continuing influence of phenomenological doctrine \nin his thinking : here, the thesis that the existent is given in the \nfirst instance as the contents of a consciousness. \n\nBy 1919 Weyl had come to embrace Brouwer’s views on the intuitive \ncontinuum. Given the idealism that always animated Weyl’s thought, \nthis is not surprising, since Brouwer assigned the thinking subject a\ncentral position in the creation of the mathematical \n world[18].\n  \n\nIn his early thinking Brouwer had held that that the continuum is \npresented to intuition as a whole, and that it is impossible to \nconstruct all its points as individuals. But later he radically \ntransformed the concept of “point”, endowing points with \nsufficient fluidity to enable them to serve as generators of a \n“true” continuum. This fluidity was achieved by admitting\nas “points”, not only fully defined discrete numbers such\nas 1/9, \\(e\\), and the like—which have, so to speak, \nalready achieved “being”—but also \n“numbers” which are in a perpetual state of \n“becoming” in that the entries in their decimal (or \ndyadic) expansions are the result of free acts of choice by a subject\noperating throughout an indefinitely extended time. The resulting \nchoice sequences cannot be conceived as finished, completed objects: \nat any moment only an initial segment is known. Thus Brouwer obtained\nthe mathematical continuum in a manner compatible with his belief in \nthe primordial intuition of time—that is, as an unfinished, in \nfact unfinishable entity in a perpetual state of growth, a \n“medium of free development”. In Brouwer’s vision, the \nmathematical continuum is indeed “constructed”, not, \nhowever, by initially shattering, as did Cantor and Dedekind, an \nintuitive continuum into isolated points, but rather by assembling it\nfrom a complex of continually changing overlapping parts. \n\nBrouwer’s impact looms large in Weyl’s 1921 paper, On the New \nFoundational Crisis of Mathematics. Here Weyl identifies two distinct\nviews of the continuum: “atomistic” or \n“discrete”; and “continuous”. In the first of\nthese the continuum is composed of individual real numbers which are \nwell-defined and can be sharply distinguished. Weyl describes his \nearlier attempt at reconstructing analysis in Das Kontinuum as \natomistic in this sense: \n\nBy this time Weyl had repudiated atomistic theories of the continuum,\nincluding that of Das \n Kontinuum.[19]\n While intuitive considerations, together with Brouwer’s influence, \nmust certainly have fuelled Weyl’s rejection of such theories, it \nalso had a logical basis. For Weyl had come to regard as meaningless \nthe formal procedure—employed in Das Kontinuum—of \nnegating universal and existential statements concerning real numbers\nconceived as developing sequences or as sets of rationals. This had \nthe effect of undermining the whole basis on which his theory had \nbeen erected, and at the same time rendered impossible the very \nformulation of a “law of excluded middle” for such \nstatements. Thus Weyl found himself espousing a \n position[20]\n considerably more radical than that of Brouwer, for whom negations of\nquantified statements had a perfectly clear constructive meaning, \nunder which the law of excluded middle is simply not generally \naffirmable. \n\nOf existential statements Weyl says: \n\nWeyl termed such pseudostatements “judgment abstracts”, \nlikening them, with typical literary flair, to “a piece of \npaper which announces the presence of a treasure, without divulging \nits location.” Universal statements, although possessing \ngreater substance than existential ones, are still mere intimations \nof judgments, “judgment instructions”, for which Weyl \nprovides the following metaphorical description: \n\nAbove and beyond the claims of logic, Weyl welcomed Brouwer’s \nconstruction of the continuum by means of sequences generated by free\nacts of choice, thus identifying it as a “medium of free \nBecoming” which “does not dissolve into a set of real \nnumbers as finished entities”. Weyl felt that Brouwer, through \nhis doctrine of \n Intuitionism[21],\n had come closer than anyone else to bridging that “unbridgeable\nchasm” between the intuitive and mathematical continua. In \nparticular, he found compelling the fact that the Brouwerian \ncontinuum is not the union of two disjoint nonempty parts—that \nit is, in a word, indecomposable. “A genuine continuum,” \nWeyl says, “cannot be divided into separate \n fragments.”[22]\n In later publications he expresses this more colourfully by quoting \nAnaxagoras to the effect that a continuum “defies the chopping \noff of its parts with a hatchet.” \n\nWeyl also agreed with Brouwer that all functions everywhere defined \non a continuum are continuous, but here certain subtle differences of\nviewpoint emerge. Weyl contends that what mathematicians had taken to\nbe discontinuous functions actually consist of several continuous \nfunctions defined on separated continua. In Weyl’s view, for example, \nthe “discontinuous” function defined by \n\\(f(x) = 0\\) for \\(x \\lt 0\\) and \n\\(f(x) = 1\\) for \\(x \\ge 0\\) in fact consists of \nthe two functions with constant values and 1 respectively \ndefined on the separated continua \\(\\{x: x \\lt 0\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{x: x \\ge 0\\}\\). (The union of these two continua \nfails to be the whole of the real continuum because of the failure of\nthe law of excluded middle: it is not the case that, for be any real \nnumber \\(x\\), either \\(x \\lt 0\\) or \\(x \\ge 0\\).) \nBrouwer, on the other hand, had not dismissed the possibility that \ndiscontinuous functions could be defined on proper parts of a \ncontinuum, and still seems to have been searching for an appropriate \nway of formulating this \n idea.[23]\n In particular, at that time Brouwer would probably have been inclined\nto regard the above function \\(f\\) as a genuinely discontinuous \nfunction defined on a proper part of the real continuum. For Weyl, it\nseems to have been a self-evident fact that all functions defined on \na continuum are continuous, but this is because Weyl confines \nattention to functions which turn out to be continuous by definition.\nBrouwer’s concept of function is less restrictive than Weyl’s and it \nis by no means immediately evident that such functions must always be\ncontinuous.  \n\nWeyl defined real functions as mappings correlating each interval in \nthe choice sequence determining the argument with an interval in the \nchoice sequence determining the value “interval by \ninterval” as it were, the idea being that approximations to the\ninput of the function should lead effectively to corresponding \napproximations to the input. Such functions are continuous by \ndefinition. Brouwer, in contrast, considers real functions as \ncorrelating choice sequences with choice sequences, and the \ncontinuity of these is by no means obvious. The fact that Weyl \nrefused to grant (free) choice sequences—whose identity is in \nno way predetermined—sufficient individuality to admit them as \narguments of functions betokens a commitment to the conception of the\ncontinuum as a “medium of free Becoming” even deeper, \nperhaps, than that of Brouwer. \n\nThere thus being only minor differences between Weyl’s and Brouwer’s \naccounts of the continuum, Weyl accordingly abandoned his earlier \nattempt at the reconstruction of analysis, and joined Brouwer. He \nexplains: \n\nWeyl’s initial enthusiasm for intuitionism seems later to have waned.\nThis may have been due to a growing belief on his part that the \nmathematical sacrifices demanded by adherence to intuitionistic \ndoctrine (e.g., the abandonment of the least upper bound principle, \nand other important results of classical analysis) would prove to be \nintolerable to practicing mathematicians. Witness this passage from \nPhilosophy of Mathematics and Natural Science: \n\nNevertheless, it is likely that Weyl remained convinced to the end of\nhis days that intuitionism, despite its technical \n“awkwardness”, came closest, of all mathematical \napproaches, to capturing the essence of the continuum. \n\nWeyl’s espousal of the intuitionistic standpoint in the foundations \nof mathematics in 1920–21 inevitably led to friction with his \nold mentor Hilbert. Hilbert’s conviction had long been that there \nwere in principle no limitations on the possibility of a full \nscientific understanding of the natural world, and, analogously, in \nthe case of mathematics, that once a problem was posed with the \nrequired precision, it was, at least in principle, soluble. In 1904 \nhe was moved to respond to Emil du Bois-Reymond’s famous declaration \nconcerning the limits of science, ignoramus et ignorabimus (“we\nare ignorant and we shall remain ignorant”): \n\nHilbert was unalterably opposed to any restriction of mathematics \n“by decree”, an obstacle he had come up against in the \nearly stages of his career in the form of Leopold Kronecker’s (the \ninfluential 19th century German mathematician) \nanathematization of all mathematics venturing beyond the finite. In \nBrouwer’s intuitionistic program—with its draconian \nrestrictions on what was admissible in mathematical argument, in \nparticular, its rejection of the law of excluded middle, \n“pure” existence proofs, and virtually the whole of \nCantorian set theory—Hilbert saw the return of Kroneckerian \nconstaints on mathematics (and also, perhaps, a trace of du \nBois-Reymond’s “ignorabimus”) against which he had \nstruggled for so long. Small wonder, then, that Hilbert was upset \nwhen Weyl joined the Brouwerian \n camp.[25] \n\nHilbert’s response was to develop an entirely new approach to the \nfoundations of mathematics with the ultimate goal of establishing \nbeyond doubt the consistency of the whole of classical mathematics, \nincluding arithmetic, analysis, and Cantorian set theory. With the \nattainment of that goal, classical mathematics would be placed \nsecurely beyond the destructive reach of the intuitionists. The core \nof Hilbert’s program was the translation of the whole apparatus of \nclassical mathematical demonstration into a simple, finitistic \nframework (which he called “metamathematics”) involving \nnothing more, in principle, than the straightforward manipulation of \nsymbols, taken in a purely formal sense, and devoid of further \n meaning.[26]\n Within metamathematics itself, Hilbert imposed a standard of \ndemonstrative evidence stricter even than that demanded by the \nintuitionists, a form of finitism rivalling (ironically) that of \nKronecker. The demonstration of the consistency of classical \nmathematics was then to be achieved by showing, within the \nconstraints of strict finitistic evidence insisted on by Hilbert, \nthat the formal metamathematical counterpart of a classical proof in \nthat system can never lead to an assertion evidently false, such as \n\\(0 = 1\\). \n\nHilbert’s program rested on the insight that, au fond, the \nonly part of mathematics whose reliability is entirely beyond \nquestion is the finitistic, or concrete part: in \nparticular, finite manipulation of surveyable domains of distinct \nobjects including mathematical symbols presented as marks on paper. \nMathematical propositions referring only to concrete objects in this \nsense Hilbert called real, concrete, or \ncontentual propositions, and all other mathematical \npropositions he distinguished as possessing an ideal, or \nabstract character. (Thus, for example, \\(2 + 2 = 4\\) would \ncount as a real proposition, while there exists an odd perfect \nnumber would count as an ideal one.) Hilbert viewed ideal \npropositions as akin to the ideal lines and points “at \ninfinity” of projective geometry. Just as the use of these does\nnot violate any truths of the “concrete” geometry of the \nusual Cartesian plane, so he hoped to show that the use of ideal \npropositions—even those of Cantorian set theory—would \nnever lead to falsehoods among the real propositions, that, in other \nwords, such use would never contradict any self-evident fact \nabout concrete objects. Establishing this by strictly concrete, \nand so unimpeachable means was thus the central aim of Hilbert’s \nprogram. Hilbert may be seen to have followed Kant in attempting to \nground mathematics on the apprehension of spatiotemporal \nconfigurations; but Hilbert restricted these configurations to \nconcrete signs (such as inscriptions on paper). Hilbert regarded \nconsistency as the touchstone of existence, and so for him the \nimportant thing was the fact that no inconsistencies can arise within\nthe realm of concrete signs, since correct descriptions of concrete \nobjects are always mutually compatible. In particular, within the \nrealm of concrete signs, actual infinity cannot generate \ninconsistencies since, again along with Kant, he held that this \nconcept cannot correspond to any concrete object. Hilbert’s view \nseems accordingly to have been that the formal soundness of \nmathematics issues ultimately, not from a logical source, \nbut from a concrete \n one[27],\n in much the same way as the consistency of truly reported empirical \nstatements is guaranteed by the concreteness of the external \n world[28].\n  \n\nWeyl soon grasped the significance of Hilbert’s program, and came to \nacknowledge its “immense significance and \n scope”[29].\n Whether that program could be successfully carried out was, of \ncourse, still an open question. But independently of this issue Weyl \nwas concerned about what he saw as the loss of content resulting from\nHilbert’s thoroughgoing formalization of mathematics. “Without \ndoubt,” Weyl warns, “if mathematics is to remain a \nserious cultural concern, then some sense must be attached \nto Hilbert’s game of formulae.” Weyl thought that this sense \ncould only be supplied by “fusing” mathematics and \nphysics so that “the mathematical concepts of number, function,\netc. (or Hilbert’s symbols) generally partake in the theoretical \nconstruction of reality in the same way as the concepts of energy, \ngravitation, electron, \n etc.”[30]\n Indeed, in Weyl’s view, “it is the function of mathematics to \nbe at the service of the natural sciences”. But still: \n\nWeyl points out that, just as in theoretical physics, Hilbert’s \naccount of mathematics “already… goes beyond the bounds \nof intuitively ascertainable states of affairs through… ideal \nassumptions.” (Weyl 1927, 484.) If Hilbert’s realm of \ncontentual or “real” propositions—the domain of \nmetamathematics—corresponds to that part of the world directly \naccessible to what Weyl terms “insight” or \n“phenomenal knowledge”, then “serious” \nmathematics—the mathematics that practicing mathematicians are \nactually engaged in doing—corresponds to Hilbert’s realm of \n“ideal” propositions. Weyl regarded this realm as the \ncounterpart of the domain generated by “symbolic \nconstruction”, the transcendent world focussed on by \ntheoretical physics. Hence his memorable characterization: \n\nIn Weyl’s eyes, Hilbert’s approach embodied the “symbolic \nrepresentation of the transcendent, which demands to be \nsatisfied”, and so he regarded its emergence as a natural \ndevelopment. But by 1927 Weyl saw Hilbert’s doctrine as beginning to \nprevail over intuitionism, and in this an adumbration of “a\ndecisive defeat of the philosophical attitude of pure \nphenomenology, which thus proves to be insufficient for the \nunderstanding of creative science even in the area of cognition that \nis most primal and most readily open to \n evidence—mathematics.”[31]\n Since by this time Weyl had become convinced that “creative \nscience” must necessarily transcend what is \nphenomenologically given, he had presumably already accepted that \npure phenomenology is incapable of accounting for theoretical \nphysics, let alone the whole of existence. But it must have been \npainful for him to concede the analogous claim in the case of \nmathematics. In 1932, he asserts: “If mathematics is \ntaken by itself, one should restrict oneself with Brouwer to the \nintuitively cognizable truths … nothing compels us to go \nfarther.” If mathematics could be “taken by \nitself”, then there would be no need for it to justify its \npractices by resorting to “symbolic construction”, to \nemploy symbols which in themselves “signify \nnothing”—nothing, at least, accessible to intuition. But,\nunlike Brouwer, Weyl seems finally to have come to terms with the \nidea that mathematics could not simply be “taken by \nitself”, that it has a larger role to play in the world beyond \nits service as a paradigm, however pure, of subjective certainty. \n\nThe later impact of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems on Hilbert’s\nprogram led Weyl to remark in \n 1949:[32] \n\nThe fact that “Gödel has left us little hope that a \nformalism wide enough to encompass classical mathematics will be \nsupported by a proof of consistency” seems to have led Weyl to \ntake a renewed interest in “axiomatic systems developed before \nHilbert without such ambitious dreams”, for example Zermelo’s \nset theory, Russell’s and Whitehead’s ramified type theory and \nHilbert’s own axiom systems for geometry (as well, possibly, as \nWeyl’s own system in Das Kontinuum, which he modestly fails \nto mention). In one of his last papers, Axiomatic Versus \nConstructive Procedures in Mathematics, written sometime after \n1953, he saw the battle between Hilbertian formalism and Brouwerian \nintuitionism in which he had participated in the 1920s as having \ngiven way to a “dextrous blending” of the axiomatic \napproach to mathematics championed by Bourbaki and the algebraists \n(themselves mathematical descendants of Hilbert) with constructive \nprocedures associated with geometry and topology. \n\nIt seems appropriate to conclude this account of Weyl’s work in the \nfoundations and philosophy of mathematics by allowing the man himself\nto have the last word: \n\nWeyl’s clarification of the role of coordinates, invariance or \nsymmetry principles, his important concept of gauge invariance, his \ngroup-theoretic results concerning the uniqueness of the Pythagorean \nform of the metric, his generalization of Levi-Civita’s concept of \nparallelism, his development of the geometry of paths, his discovery \nof the causal-inertial method which prepared the way to empirically \ndetermine the spacetime metric in a non-circular, non-conventional \nmanner, his deep analysis of the concept of motion and the role of \nMach’s Principle, are but a few examples of his important \ncontributions to the philosophical and mathematical foundations of \nmodern spacetime theory.  \n\nWeyl’s book, Raum-Zeit-Materie, beautifully exemplifies the \nfruitful and harmonious interplay of mathematics, physics and \nphilosophy. Here Weyl aims at a mathematical and philosophical \nelucidation of the problem of space and time in general. In the \npreface to the great classical work of 1923, the fifth German \nedition, after mentioning the importance of mathematics to his work, \nWeyl says:  \n\nExtending and abstracting from Gauss’s treatment of curved surfaces \nin Euclidian space, Riemann constructed an infinitesimal geometry of \n\\(n\\)-dimensional manifolds. The coordinate assignments \n\\(x^{k}(p)\\ [k \\in \\{1, \\ldots ,n\\}\\)] of the points \\(p\\) in such an \\(n\\)-dimensional \nRiemannian manifold are quite arbitrary, subject only to the \nrequirement of arbitrary differential coordinate \n transformations.[33]\n Riemann’s assumption that in an infinitesimal neighbourhood of a \npoint, Euclidean geometry and hence Pythagoras’s theorem holds, finds\nits formal expression in Riemann’s equation  \n\nfor the square of the length \\(ds\\) of an infinitesimal line \nelement that leads from the point \\(p = x(p) = \n(x^{1}(p), \\ldots ,x^{n}(p))\\) to an arbitrary infinitely \nnear point \\(p' = x(p') = (x^{1}(p) + dx^{1}(p), \\ldots ,x^{n}(p) + dx^{n}(p))\\).  \n\nThe assumption that Euclidean geometry holds in the infinitesimally \nsmall means that the \\(dx^{i}(p)\\) \ntransform linearly under arbitrary coordinate \ntransformations. Using the Einstein summation \n convention[34],\n equation (1) can simply be written as  \n\nRiemann assumed the validity of the Pythagorean metric only in the \ninfinitely small. Riemannian geometry is essentially a geometry of \ninfinitely near points and conforms to the requirement that all laws \nare to be formulated as field laws. Field laws are \nclose-action-laws which relate the field magnitudes only to \ninfinitesimally neighbouring points in \n space.[35]\n The value of some field magnitude at each point depends only on the \nvalues of other field magnitudes in the infinitesimal neighbourhoods \nof the corresponding points. The field magnitudes consist of partial \nderivatives of position functions at some point, and this requires \nthe knowledge of the behavior of the position functions only with \nrespect to the neighbourhood of that point. To construct a field law,\nonly the behavior of the world in the infinitesimally small is \n required.[36] \n\nRiemann’s ideas were brought to a concrete realization fifty years \nlater in Einstein’s general theory of relativity. The basic idea \nunderlying the general theory of relativity was Einstein’s \nrecognition that the metric field, which has such powerful real \neffects on matter, cannot be a rigid once and for all given geometric\nstructure of the spacetime, but must itself be something real, that \nnot only has effects on matter, but is in turn also affected by \nmatter. Riemann had already suggested that analogous to the \nelectromagnetic field, the metric field reciprocally interacts with \nmatter. Einstein came to this idea of reciprocity between matter and \nfield independently of Riemann, and in the context of his theory of \ngeneral relativity, applied this principle of reciprocity to four \ndimensional spacetime. Thus Einstein could adopt Riemann’s \ninfinitesimal geometry with the important difference: given the \ncausal requirements of Einstein’s theory of special relativity, \nRiemann’s quadratic form is not positive definite but indefinite; it \nhas signature \n 1.[37]\n Weyl (1922a) says:  \n\nAnd in another place Weyl (1918b) remarks:  \n\nAfter Einstein applied Riemannian geometry to his theory of general \nrelativity, Riemannian geometry became the focus of intense research.\nIn particular, G. Ricci and T. Levi-Civita’s so-called Absolute \nDifferential Calculus developed and clarified the Riemannian \nnotions of an affine connection and covariant \ndifferentiation. The decisive step in this development, however,\nwas T. Levi-Civita’s discovery in 1917 of the concept of \ninfinitesimal parallel vector displacement, and the\nfact that such parallel vector displacement is uniquely determined by\nthe metric field of Riemannian geometry. Levi-Civita’s construction \nof infinitesimal parallel transport on a manifold required the \nprocess of embedding the manifold into a flat higher-dimensional \nmetric space. In 1918, Weyl generalized Levi-Civita’s concept of \nparallel transport by means of an intrinsic construction \nthat does not require the process of such an embedding, and is \ntherefore independent of a metric. Weyl’s intrinsic construction \nresults in a metric-independent, symmetric linear \nconnection. Weyl simply referred to the latter as \naffine \n connection.[38] \n\nWeyl defines what he means by an affine connection in the \nfollowing way: A point \\(p\\) on the manifold \\(M\\) is affinely \nconnected with its immediate neighborhood, if and only of for every \ntangent vector \\(v_{p}\\) at \\(p\\), a tangent \nvector \\(v_{q}\\) at \\(q\\) is determined to which\nthe tangent vector \\(v_{p}\\) gives rise under \nparallel displacement from \\(p\\) to the infinitesimally \nneighboring point \\(q\\). This definition merely says that a \nmanifold is affinely connected if it admits the process of \ninfinitesimal parallel displacement of a vector.  \n\nWeyl’s next definition characterizes the essential nature of\ninfinitesimal parallel displacement. The definition says that at any \narbitrary point of the manifold there exists a geodesic \ncoordinate system such that the components of any vector at that\npoint are not altered by an infinitesimal parallel displacement with \nrespect to it. This is a geometrical way of expressing Einstein’s \nrequirement that the gravitational field can always be made to vanish\nlocally. According to Weyl (1923b, 115), it characterizes the \nnature of an affine connection on the manifold. A manifold \nwhich is an affine manifold is homogeneous in this sense. Moreover, \nmanifolds do not exist whose affine structure is of a different \nnature.  \n\nThe transport of a tangent vector \\(v_{p}\\) at \n\\(p\\) to an infinitesimally nearby point \\(q\\) results in the \ntangent vector \\(v_{q}\\) at \\(q\\), namely,  \n\nThis infinitesimal tangent vector transport Weyl defines as \ninfinitesimal parallel displacement if and only if there \nexists a coordinate system \\(\\overline{x}\\), called a geodesic coordinate system\nfor the neighborhood of \\(p\\), relative to which the transported \ntangent vector \\(\\overline{v}_{q}\\) at \\(q\\) \npossesses the same components as the original tangent vector \\(\\overline{v}_{p}\\) at \\(p\\); that is,  Figure 1: Parallel transport in a geodesic coordinate system \\(\\overline{x}\\) \n\nFor an arbitrary coordinate system \\(x\\) the components \\(dv^{\\,i}_p\\)\nvanish whenever \\(v^{\\,i}_p\\) or \\(dx^{\\,i}_p\\) vanish. Consequently,\n\\(dv^{\\,i}_p\\) is bi-linear in \\(v^{\\,i}_p\\) and\n\\(dx^{\\,i}_p\\); that is,  \n\nwhere, in the case of four dimensions, the \\(4^{3} = 64\\)\ncoefficients \\(\\Gamma^{\\,i}_{jk} (x^{i}(p))\\)\nare coordinate functions, that is, functions of \n\\(x^{i}(p)\\) \\((i = 1, \\ldots, 4)\\), \nand the minus sign is introduced to agree with convention.  Figure 2: Parallel transport in an arbitrary coordinate system \\(x\\) \n\nIt is important to understand that there is no intrinsic notion of \ninfinitesimal parallel displacement on a differentiable manifold. A \nnotion of “parallelism” is not something that a manifold \nwould possess merely by virtue of being a smooth manifold; additional\nstructure has to be introduced which resides on the manifold and \nwhich permits the notion of infinitesimal parallelism. A manifold is \nan “affine manifold” \\((M, \\Gamma)\\) if in addition to its \nmanifold structure (differential topological structure) it is also \nendowed with an affine structure \\(\\Gamma\\) that assigns to each of its \npoints 64 coefficients \\(\\Gamma^{i}_{jk} (x^{i}(p))\\)\nsatisfying the symmetry condition \\(\\Gamma^{i}_{jk} (x^{i}(p))\n= \\Gamma^{i}_{kj} (x^{i}(p))\\).\n \n\nAn \\(n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\), which is an affinely \nconnected manifold, Weyl (1918b) interprets physically as an \n\\(n\\)-dimensional world (spacetime) filled with a gravitational \nfield. Weyl says, “…the affine connection appears in \nphysics as the gravitational field…” Since \nthere exists at each spacetime point a geodesic coordinate system in \nwhich the components \\(\\Gamma^{i}_{jk}\\) of the symmetric linear \nconnection vanish, the gravitational field can be made to vanish at \neach point of the manifold.  \n\nThe classical theory of physical geometry, developed by \nHelmholtz, Poincaré and Hilbert, regarded the concept of \n“metric congruence” as the only basic relation of \ngeometry, and constructed physical geometry from this one notion \nalone in terms of the relative positions and displacements of \nphysical congruence standards. Although Einstein’s general theory of \nrelativity championed a dynamical view of spacetime \ngeometry that is very different from the classical theory of\nphysical geometry, Einstein initially approached the problem of \nthe structure of spacetime from the metrical point of view. It was \nWeyl (1923b) who emphasized and developed the metric-independent \nconstruction of the symmetric linear connection and who pointed out \nthe rationale for doing so. In both the non-relativistic and \nrelativistic contexts, it is the symmetric linear connection, and not\nthe metric, which plays the essential role in the formulation of all \nphysical laws that are expressed in terms of differential equations. \nIt is the symmetric linear connection that relates the state of a \nsystem at a spacetime point to the states at neighboring spacetime \nevents and enters into the differentials of the corresponding \nmagnitudes. In both Newtonian physics and the theory of general \nrelativity, all dynamical laws presuppose the projective and affine \nstructure and hence the Law of Inertia. In fact, the whole of tensor \nanalysis with its covariant derivatives is based on the affine \nconcept of infinitesimal parallel displacement and not \non the metric.  \n\nWeyl’s metric independent construction not only led to a deeper \nunderstanding of the mathematical characterization of gravity, it \nalso prepared the way for new constructions and generalizations in \ndifferential geometry and the general theory of relativity. In \nparticular, it led to  \n\nFor more detail on Weyl’s metric independent construction of the \naffine connection (linear symmetric connection), see \n the supplement.\n  \n\nWeyl’s metric-independent construction of the affine structure led to\nthe development of differential projective geometries or the\ngeometries of paths. The interest in projective geometry is \nin the paths, that is, in the continuous set of points of \nthe image set of curves, rather than in the possible \nparameter descriptions of curves. A curve has one degree of freedom; \nit depends on one parameter, and its image set or path is a \none-dimensional continuous set of points of the manifold. One \nrepresents a curve on a manifold \\(M\\) as a smooth map \n(i.e., \\(C^{\\infty})\\) \\(\\gamma\\) from some open interval \n\\(I = (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon)\\) of the real line \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) into\n\\(M\\).  Figure 3:\nA curve on the manifold \\(M\\) is the smooth map \n\\(\\gamma : I \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow M\\) \n\nIt is important to understand that what one means by a \n“curve” is the map (the parametric description) itself, \nand not the set of its image points, the path. Consequently,\ntwo curves are mathematically considered to be different curves if \nthey are given by different maps (different parameter descriptions), \neven if their image set, that is, their path, is the \nsame. If we change a curve’s parameter description we change the\ncurve but not its image set (its path), the points it passes through.\nA path is therefore sometimes defined as an equivalence class of \ncurves under arbitrary parameter transformations. Hence, projective \ngeometry may be defined as an equivalence class of affine geometries.\n \n\nA geodesic curve in flat space is a straight line. Its \ntangent at one point is parallel to the tangent at previous or \nsubsequent points. A straight line in Euclidean space is the only \ncurve that parallel-transports its own tangent vector. This notion of\nparallel transport of the tangent vector also characterizes geodesic \ncurves in curved space. That is, a curve \\(\\gamma\\) in curved \nspace, which parallel-transports its own tangent vector along all of \nits points, is called a geodesic curve. Given a manifold \nwith an affine structure and some arbitrary local coordinate system, \nthe coordinate functions (components) \\(\\gamma^{i}\\) of a\ngeodesic curve \\(\\gamma\\) satisfy the second-order non-linear \ndifferential equations  \n\nOne may characterize the projective geometry \\(\\Pi\\) on an \naffine manifold either in terms of an equivalence class of geodesic \ncurves under arbitrary parameter \n diffeomorphisms[39],\n thereby eliminating all the parameter descriptions and hence all \npossible notions of distance along the curves satisfying \n (6),[40]\n or one may take the process of autoparallelism of directions \nas fundamental in defining a projective structure.  Figure 4: \nA path \\(\\xi\\) is an equivalence class [\\(\\gamma\\)] of curves \nunder all parameter diffeomorphisms \\(\\mu: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R};\n\\lambda \\mapsto \\mu(\\lambda)\\) \n\nWeyl took the latter approach. According to Weyl, the infinitesimal \nprocess of parallel displacements of vectors contains, as a special \ncase, the infinitesimal displacement of a direction into its\nown direction. Such an infinitesimal autoparallelism of \ndirections is characteristic of the projective structure of \nan affinely connected manifold.  \nInfinitesimal Autoparallelism of a Direction:\nAn infinitesimal autoparallelism of a direction \\(R\\) at an\narbitrary point \\(p\\) consists in the parallel displacement of \\(R\\)\nat \\(p\\) to a neighbouring point \\(p'\\) which lies in the direction\n\\(R\\) at \\(p\\). \n\nA curve is geodesic if and only if its tangent direction\n\\(R\\) experiences infinitesimal autoparallelism when moved \nalong all the points of the curve. This characterization of a \ngeodesic curve constitutes an abstraction from affine geometry. \nThrough this abstraction, a geodesic curve is definable exclusively \nin terms of autoparallelism of tangent directions, and not \ntangent vectors. Roughly speaking, an affine geometry is \nessentially a projective geometry with the notion of distance defined\nalong the curves. By eliminating all possible notions of distance \nalong curves, or equivalently, all the parameter descriptions of the \ncurves, one abstracts the projective geometry form affine geometry.  \n\nAs mentioned above, a projective geometry \\(\\Pi\\) may be defined as an \nequivalence class of affine geometries, that is, an equivalence class\nof projectively related affine connections [\\(\\Gamma\\)]. Weyl \npresented the details of his approach to projective geometry, which \nuses the notion of autoparallelism of direction, in a set of\nlectures delivered in Barcelona and Madrid in the spring of 1922 \n(Weyl (1923a); see also Weyl (1921c)). Weyl began with the following \nnecessary and sufficient condition for the invariance of the \nprojective structure \\(\\Pi\\) under a transformation \n\\(\\Gamma \\rightarrow \\overline{\\Gamma}\\) of the affine \nstructure:  \nProjective Transformation: \nA transformation \\(\\Gamma \\rightarrow \\overline{\\Gamma}\\)\npreserves the projective structure \\(\\Pi\\) of a \nmanifold with an affine structure \\(\\Gamma\\), and is called a \nprojective transformation, if and only if where \\(v^{\\,i}\\) is an arbitrary vector. \n\nWeyl’s definition says that a change in the affine structure of\nthe manifold \\(M\\) preserves the projective structure \\(\\Pi\\) of \\(M\\)\nif the vectors \\(v^{i}_{q}\\) and \\(\\overline{v}^{i}_{q}\\) at \\(q\\)\nthat result from the vector \\(v^{i}_{p}\\) at \\(p\\) by parallel\ntransport under \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\overline{\\Gamma}\\) respectively,\ndiffer at most in length but not in\n direction.[41] \n\nA spacetime manifold \\(M\\) is a “projective manifold” \n(M, \\(\\Pi)\\), if in addition to its manifold structure (differential \ntopological structure), it is also endowed with a projective structure\n\\(\\Pi\\) that assigns to each of its manifold points 64 coefficients \n\\(\\Pi^{\\,i}_{jk} x^{i}(p))\\)\nsatisfying certain symmetry \n conditions.[42]\n These projective coefficients characterize the equivalence class \n[\\(\\Gamma\\)] of projectively equivalent connections, that is, \nconnections equivalent under the projective transformation \n(7).  \n\nIn physical spacetime the projective structure has an immediate \nintuitive significance according to Weyl. The real world is a \nnon-empty spacetime filled with an inertial-gravitational field, \nwhich Weyl calls the guiding field \n \\((F\\)ührungsfeld)[43].\n It is an indubitable fact, according to Weyl (1923a, 13), that a body\nwhich is let free in a certain spacetime direction (time-like \ndirection) carries out a uniquely determined natural motion from \nwhich it can only be diverted through an external force. The process \nof autoparallelism of direction appears, thus, as the tendency of \npersistence of the spacetime direction of a free particle whose \nmotion is governed by, what Weyl calls, the guiding field \n\\((F\\)ührungsfeld). This natural \nmotion occurs on the basis of an effective infinitesimal tendency of \npersistence, that parallelly displaces the spacetime direction \n\\(R\\) of a body at an arbitrary point \\(p\\) on its trajectory \nto a neighbouring point \\(p'\\) that lies in the direction \n\\(R\\) at \\(p\\).  \n\nIf external forces exert themselves on a body, then a motion results \nwhich is determined through the conflict between the tendency of \npersistence due to the guiding field and the force. The tendency of \npersistence of the guiding field is a type of constraining guidance, \nthat the inertial-gravitational field exerts on every body. Weyl \n(1923b, 219) says:  \n\nGalilei’s inertial law shows, that there exists a type of \nconstraining guidance in the world [spacetime] that imposes\non a body that is let free in some definite world direction a unique \nnatural motion from which it can only be diverted through external \nforces; this occurs on the basis of an effective infinitesimal \ntendency of persistence from point to point, that \nauto-parallelly transfers the world direction \\(r\\) of \nthe body at an arbitrary point \\(P\\) to an infinitesimally close \nneighboring point \\(P'\\), that lies in the direction \n\\(r\\) at \\(P\\). \n\nShortly after the completion of the general theory of relativity in \n1915, Einstein, Weyl, and others began to work on a unified field \ntheory. It was natural to assume at that \n time[44]\n that this task would only involve the unification of gravity and \nelectromagnetism. In Einstein’s geometrization of gravity, the \nNewtonian gravitational potential, and the Newtonian gravitational \nforce, are respectively replaced by the components of the metric \ntensor \\(g_{ij}(x)\\), and the components of \nthe symmetric linear connection \\(\\Gamma^{i}_{jk}(x)\\). In the general \ntheory of relativity the gravitational field is thus accounted for in\nterms of the curvature of spacetime, but the electromagnetic field \nremains completely unrelated to the spacetime geometry. Einstein’s \nmathematical formulation of his theory of general relativity does \nnot, however, provide room for the geometrization of the other long \nrange force field, the electromagnetic \n field.[45]\n It was therefore natural to ask whether nature’s only two long range \nfields of force have a common origin. Consequently, it was quite \nnatural to suggest that the electromagnetic field might also be \nascribed to some property of spacetime, instead of being merely \nsomething embedded in spacetime. Since, however, the components \n\\(g_{ij}(x)\\) of the metric tensor are \nalready sufficiently determined by Einstein’s field equations, this \nwould require setting up a more general differential geometry than \nthe one which underlies Einstein’s theory, in order to make room for \nincorporating electromagnetism into spacetime geometry. Such a \ngeneralized differential geometry would describe both long range \nforces, and a new theory based on this geometry would constitute a \nunified field theory of electromagnetism and gravitation.  \n\nIn 1918, Weyl proposed such a theory. In Weyl (1918a, 1919a), and in \nthe third edition (1920) of Raum-Zeit-Materie, Weyl \npresented his ingenious attempt to unify gravitation and \nelectromagnetism by constructing a gauge-invariant geometry (see \nbelow), or what he called a purely infinitesimal \n‘metric’ geometry. Since the conformal structure \n\\(C\\) (see below) of spacetime does not determine a unique \nsymmetric linear connection \\(\\Gamma\\) but only an equivalence class \n\\(K = [\\Gamma]\\) of conformally equivalent symmetric linear \nconnections, Weyl was able to show that this degree of freedom \nin a conformal structure of spacetime provides just enough room for \nthe geometrization of the electromagnetic potentials. The resulting \ngeometry, called a Weyl geometry, is an intermediate \ngeometric structure that lies between the conformal and Riemannian \n structures.[46] \n\nThe metric tensor field that is locally described by  \n\nis characteristic of a Riemannian geometry. That geometry requires of\nthe symmetric linear connection \\(\\Gamma\\) that the infinitesimal \nparallel transport of a vector always preserves the length of the \nvector. Therefore, the metric field in Riemannian geometry determines\na unique symmetric linear connection, a “metric \nconnection” that satisfies the length-preserving condition of \nparallel transport. This means that the metric field, locally \nrepresented by (8), is invariant under parallel transport. The \ncoefficients of this unique symmetric linear metric \nconnection are given by  \n\nIf \\(v_{p}\\) is a vector at \\(p \\in M\\), its length  \n\nMoreover, the angle between two vectors \\(v_{p}\\) \nand \\(w_{p}\\) at  \\(p\\in M\\) is given by  \n\nWhile in Riemannian geometry the parallel transport of length is \npath independent, that is, it is possible to compare the \nlengths of any two vectors, even if they are located at two finitely \ndifferent points, a vector suffers a path-dependent change \nin direction under parallel transport; that is, it is not \npossible to define the angle between two vectors, located at \ndifferent points, in a path-independent way. Consequently, the angle \nbetween two vectors at a given point is invariant under parallel \ntransport if and only if both vectors are transported along the \nsame path. In particular, a vector which is carried around a \nclosed circuit by a continual parallel displacement back to the \nstarting point, will have the same length, but will not in general \nreturn to its initial direction.  Figure 5: The parallel transport of a\nvector by a two-dimensional creature, from \\(A \\rightarrow B\n\\rightarrow C \\rightarrow A\\) around a geodesic triangle on a\ntwo-dimensional surface \\(S^{2}\\), ends up pointing in a different\ndirection upon returning to \\(A\\). \n\nFor a closed loop which circumscribes an infinitesimally small \nportion of space, the rotation of the vector per unit area \nconstitutes the measure of the local curvature of space. \nConsequently, whether or not finite parallel displacement of \ndirection is integrable, that is, path-independent, depends \non whether or not the curvature tensor vanishes.  \n\nAccording to Weyl, Riemannian geometry, is not a pure or genuine \ninfinitesimal differential (metric) geometry, since it\npermits the comparison of length at a finite distance. In his seminal\n1918 paper entitled Gravitation und Elektrizität\n(Gravitation and Electricity) Weyl (1918a) says:  \n\nHowever, in the Riemannian geometry described above, there remains a\nlast distant-geometric [ferngeometrisches] element—without any\nsound reason, as far as I can see; the only cause of this appears to\nbe the development of Riemannian geometry from the theory of\nsurfaces. The metric permits the comparison of length of two vectors\nnot only at the same point, but also at any arbitrarily separated\npoints. A true near-geometry (Nahegeometrie), however, may\nrecognize only a principle of transferring a length at a point to an\ninfinitesimal neighbouring point, and then it is no more\nreasonable to assume that the transfer of length from a point to a\nfinitely distant point is integrable, then it was to assume that the\ntransfer of direction is integrable. \n\nWeyl wanted a metric geometry which would not permit distance \ncomparison of length between two vectors located at finitely \ndifferent points. In a pure infinitesimal geometry, Weyl \nargued, if attention is restricted to a single point of the manifold,\nthen some standard of length or gauge must be chosen \narbitrarily before the lengths of vectors can be determined. \nTherefore, all that is intrinsic to the notion of a pure \ninfinitesimal metric differential geometry is the ability to \ndetermine the ratios of the lengths of any two vectors and \nthe angle between any two vectors, at a point. Such a pure \ninfinitesimal metric manifold must have at least a \nconformal structure \\(C\\).  \n\nThe defining characteristic of a conformal spacetime structure is \ngiven by the equation  \n\nwhich determines the light cone at \\(p\\). A gauge transformation \nof the metric is a map  \n\nwhich preserves the metric up to a positive and smooth but otherwise \narbitrary scalar factor or gauge function \n\\(\\lambda(x(p))\\). In the case of a pseudo-Riemannian \nstructure such a gauge transformation leaves the light cones \nunaltered. The angle between two vectors at \\(p\\) is given by \n(11). Clearly, the gauge transformation \n\\(\\overline{g}_{ij}(x(p)) = \\lambda(x(p))g_{ij}(x(p))\\)\nis angle preserving, that is, conformal. Two metrics which are \nrelated by a conformal gauge transformation are called \nconformally equivalent. A conformal structure does not \ndetermine the length of any one vector at a point. Only the relative \nlengths, the ratio of lengths, of any two vectors \n\\(\\bfrac{\\lvert v_p \\rvert}{\\lvert w_p \\rvert}\\)\nis determined.  \n\nWeyl exploited these features of the conformal structure, and \nsuggested that given a conformal structure, a gauge could be\nchosen at each point in a smooth but otherwise arbitrary manner, such\nthat the metric (8) at any point of the manifold is conventional or \nundetermined to the extent that the metric  \n\nis equally valid.  \n\nHowever, a conformal structure by itself does not determine a unique \nsymmetric linear connection; it only determines an equivalence class \nof conformally equivalent connections \\(K = [\\Gamma]\\), namely, \nconnections which preserve the conformal structure \\(C\\) during \nparallel transport. The difference between any two conformally \nequivalent symmetric linear connections \\(\\overline{\\Gamma}^{\\,i}_{jk}\\), \n\\(\\Gamma^i_{jk} \\in [\\Gamma]\\) is given by  \n\nwhere  \nis an arbitrary one-form field.  \n\nSince the conformal structure determines only an equivalence class of\nconformally equivalent symmetric linear connections \\(K = [\\Gamma]\\),\nthe affine connection in this type of geometry is not uniquely\ndetermined, and the parallel transport of vectors is not generally\nwell defined. Moreover, the ratio of the lengths of two vectors\nlocated at different points is not determined even in a path-dependent\nway. According to Weyl, it is a fundamental principle of infinitesimal\ngeometry that the metric structure on a manifold \\(M\\) determines a\nunique affine structure on \\(M\\). As was pointed out earlier, this\nprinciple is satisfied in Riemannian geometry where the metric\ndetermines a unique symmetric linear connection, namely, the metric\nconnection according to (9). Evidently this fundamental principle of\ninfinitesimal geometry is not satisfied for a structure which is\nmerely a conformal structure, since the conformal structure only\ndetermines an equivalence class of conformally equivalent symmetric\nconnections. Weyl showed that besides the conformal structure an\nadditional structure is required in order to determine a unique\nsymmetric linear connection from the equivalence class \n\\(K = [\\Gamma]\\) of conformally equivalent symmetric linear\nconnections. Weyl showed that this additional structure is provided by\nthe length connection or gauge field \\(A_{j}\\) that\ngoverns the congruent displacement of lengths. Weyl called\nthis additional structure the “metric connection” on a\nmanifold; however, we shall use the term “length\nconnection” instead, in order to avoid confusion with the modern\nusage of the term “metric connection”, which today denotes\nthe symmetric linear connection that is uniquely determined by a\nRiemannian metric tensor according to (9).  \nWeyl’s Length Connection:\nA point \\(p\\) is length connected with its infinitesimal\nneighborhood, if and only if for every length at \\(p\\), there is\ndetermined at every point \\(q\\) infinitesimally close to \\(p\\) a\nlength to which the length at \\(p\\) gives rise when it\nis congruently displaced from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\). \n\nThis definition merely says that a manifold is “length \nconnected” if it admits the process of infinitesimal congruent \ndisplacement of length. The only condition imposed on the concept of \ncongruent displacement of length is the following:  \n\nCongruent Displacement of Length: \nWith respect to a choice of gauge for a neighborhood of \\(p\\), the\ntransport of a length \\(l_{p}\\) at \\(p\\) to an infinitesimally\nneighboring point \\(q\\) constitutes a\ncongruent displacement if and only if there exists a choice \nof gauge for the neighborhood of \\(p\\) relative to which the \ntransported length \n\\(\\overline{l}_{q}\\) has the same value as \n\\(\\overline{l}_{p}\\); that is  \n\nWeyl called such a gauge at \\(p\\) a geodesic gauge at \n \\(p\\).[47]\n Weyl’s proof of the following theorem closely parallels the proof of \ntheorem A.3 in \n the supplement on Weyl’s metric independent construction of the affine connection.\n  \nTheorem 4.1: If for every point \\(p\\) in a \nneighborhood \\(U\\) of \\(M\\), there exists a choice of gauge \nsuch that the change in an arbitrary length at \\(p\\) under \ncongruent displacement to an infinitesimally near point \\(q\\) is \ngiven by  \n\nthen locally with respect to any other choice of gauge,  \nand conversely. \n\nMaking use of  \n\nWeyl (1923a, 124–125) shows that the conformal structure \nsupplemented with the structure of a length connection or \ngauge field \\(A_{j}(x)\\) singles \nout a unique connection from the equivalence class \\(K = [\\Gamma]\\) of \nconformally equivalent \n connections.[48]\n This unique connection, which is called the Weyl connection,\nis given by  \n\nwhich is analogous to (14). The first term of the Weyl connection is \nidentical to the metric connection (9) of Riemannian geometry, \nwhereas the second term represents what is new in a Weyl geometry. \nThe Weyl connection is invariant under the gauge transformation  \n\nwhere the gauge function is \\(\\lambda(x) = e^{\\theta(x)}\\). Thus, a\nconformal structure plus length connection or gauge\nfield \\(A_{j}(x)\\) determines a Weyl geometry\nequipped with a unique Weyl connection. Therefore, the \nfundamental principle of infinitesimal geometry also holds in a Weyl \ngeometry; that is, the metric structure of a Weyl geometry determines\na unique affine connection, namely, the Weyl connection.  \n\nIn Weyl’s physical interpretation of his purely infinitesimal metric \ngeometry (Weyl geometry), the gauge field \n\\(A_{j}(x)\\) is identified with the \nelectromagnetic four potential, and the electromagnetic field tensor \nis given by  \n\nA spacetime that is formally characterizable as a Weyl geometry, would\nnot only have a curvature of direction\n(Richtungskrümmung) but would also have a curvature\nof length (Streckenkrümmung). Because of the latter\nproperty the formal characterization of the congruent displacement of\nlength would be non-integrable, that is, path-dependent, in a Weyl\ngeometry.  Figure 6: \nIn a Weyl geometry parallel displacement of a vector along different\npaths not only changes its direction but also its\nlength \n\nSuppose physical spacetime corresponds to a Weyl geometry. Then two \nidentical clocks \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) at an event \\(p\\) with a \ncommon unit of time, that is, a timelike vector of given length \n\\(l_{p}\\), which are separated and moved along \ndifferent world lines to an event \\(q\\), will not only differ with\nrespect to the elapsed time (first clock effect (i.e., relativistic \neffect)), but in general the clocks will differ with respect to their\ncommon unit of time (rate of ticking) at \\(q\\) (second clock \neffect). That is, congruent time displacement in a Weyl geometry is \nsuch that two congruent time intervals at \\(p\\) will not in \ngeneral be congruent at \\(q\\), when congruently displaced in \nparallel along different world lines from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\), that \nis, \\(l^{A}_{q} \\ne l^{B}_{q}\\). \nThis means that a twin who travels to a distant star and then returns\nto earth would not only discover that the other twin on earth had \naged much more, but also that all the clocks on earth tick at a \ndifferent rate. Hence, in the presence of a non-vanishing \nelectromagnetic field \\(F_{jk}(x)\\) the \nclock rates will not in general be the same; that is, there will be a\nsecond clock effect in addition to the relativistic effect (first \nclock effect). Thus, \\(l^{A}_{q} = l^{B}_{q}\\) if \nand only if the curl of \\(A_{j}(x)\\) \nvanishes, that is, if and only if the electromagnetic field tensor \n\\(F_{jk}(x)\\) vanishes, namely,  \n\nIn that case the second term of the Weyl connection vanishes and (19)\nreduces to the metric connection (9) of Riemannian geometry.  \n\nIn a Weyl geometry there are no ideal absolute “meter \nsticks” or “clocks”. For example, the rate at which\nany clock measures time is a function of its history. However, as \nEinstein pointed out in a Nachtrag (addendum) to Weyl \n(1918a), it is precisely this situation which suggests that Weyl’s \ngeometry conflicts with experience. In Weyl’s geometry, the frequency\nof the spectral lines of atomic clocks would depend on the location \nand past histories of the atoms. But experience indicates otherwise. \nThe spectral lines are well-defined and sharp; they appear to be \nindependent of an atom’s history. Atomic clocks define units of time,\nand experience shows they are integrably transported. Thus, if we \nassume that the atomic time and the gravitational standard time are \nidentical, and that the gravitational standard time is determined by \nthe Weyl geometry, then the electromagnetic field tensor is zero. But\nif that is the case, then a Weyl geometry reduces to the standard \nRiemannian geometry that underlies general relativity, since the \nvanishing of Weyl’s Streckenkrümmung \n(length curvature) is necessary and sufficient for the \nexistence of a Riemannian metric \\(g_{ij}\\).  \n\nWhen \nquantum theory was developed a few years later it became clear that \nWeyl’s theory was in conflict with experience in an even more \nfundamental way since there is a direct relation between clock rates \nand masses of particles in quantum theory. A particle with a certain \nrest mass \\(m\\) possesses a natural frequency which is a function \nof its rest mass, the speed of light \\(c\\), and Planck’s constant \n\\(h\\). This means that in a Weyl geometry not only clocks would \ndepend on their histories but also the masses of particles. For \nexample, if two protons have different histories then they would also\nhave different masses in a Weyl geometry. But this violates the \nquantum mechanical principle that particles of the same kind—in\nthis case, protons—have to be exactly identical.  \n\nHowever, in 1918 it was still possible for Weyl to defend his theory \nin the following way. In response to Einstein’s criticism Weyl noted \nthat atoms, clocks and meter sticks are complex objects whose real \nbehavior in arbitrary gravitational and electromagnetic fields can \nonly be inferred from a dynamical theory of matter. Since no detailed\nand reliable dynamical models were available at that time, Weyl could\nargue that there is no reason to assume that, for example, clock \nrates are correctly modelled by the length of a timelike vector. Weyl\n(1919a, 67) said:  \n\nAt first glance it might be surprising that according to the purely\nclose-action geometry, length transfer is non-integrable in the\npresence of an electromagnetic field. Does this not clearly contradict\nthe behaviour of rigid bodies and clocks? The behaviour of these\nmeasurement instruments, however, is a physical process whose course\nis determined by natural laws and as such has nothing to do with the\nideal process of ‘congruent displacement of spacetime\ndistance’ that we employ in the mathematical construction of the\nspacetime geometry. The connection between the metric field and the\nbehaviour of rigid rods and clocks is already very unclear in the\ntheory of Special Relativity if one does not restrict oneself to\nquasi-stationary motion. Although these instruments play an\nindispensable role in praxis as indicators of the metric field, (for\nthis purpose, simpler processes would be preferable, for example, the\npropagation of light waves), it is clearly incorrect\nto define the metric field through the data that are directly\nobtained from these instruments. \n\nWeyl elaborated this idea by suggesting that the dynamical nature of\nsuch time keeping systems was such that they\ncontinually adapt to the spacetime structure in such a way\nthat their rates remain constant. He distinguished between quantities\nthat remain constant as a consequence of such dynamical\nadjustment, and quantities that remain constant\nby persistence because they are isolated and undisturbed. He\nargued that all quantities that maintain a perfect constancy probably\ndo so as a result of dynamical adjustment. Weyl (1921a, 261)\nexpressed these ideas in the following way:  \n\nWhat is the cause of this discrepancy between the idea of congruent \ntransfer and the behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks? I \ndifferentiate between the determination of a magnitude in Nature by \n“persistence” (Beharrung) and by \n“adjustment” (Einstellung). I shall make the \ndifference clear by the following illustration: We can give to the \naxis of a rotating top any arbitrary direction in space. This \narbitrary original direction then determines for all time the \ndirection of the axis of the top when left to itself, by means of a \ntendency of persistence which operates from moment to \nmoment; the axis experiences at every instant a parallel \ndisplacement. The exact opposite is the case for a magnetic needle in\na magnetic field. Its direction is determined at each instant \nindependently of the condition of the system at other instants by the\nfact that, in virtue of its constitution, the system adjusts \nitself in an unequivocally determined manner to the field in \nwhich it is situated. A priori we have no ground for \nassuming as integrable a transfer which results purely from the \ntendency of persistence. …Thus, although, for example, \nMaxwell’s equations demand the conservational equation \n\\(de\\,/\\,dt =0\\) for the charge \\(e\\) of an \nelectron, we are unable to understand from this fact why an electron,\neven after an indefinitely long time, always possesses an unaltered \ncharge, and why the same charge \\(e\\) is associated with all \nelectrons. This circumstance shows that the charge is not determined \nby persistence, but by adjustment, and that there can exist only \none state of equilibrium of the negative electricity, to \nwhich the corpuscle adjusts itself afresh at every instant. For the \nsame reason we can conclude the same thing for the spectral lines of \natoms. The one thing common to atoms emitting the same frequency is \ntheir constitution, and not the agreement of their frequencies on the\noccasion of an encounter in the distant past. Similarly, the length \nof a measuring-rod is obviously determined by adjustment, for I could\nnot give this measuring-rod in this field-position \nany other length arbitrarily (say double or treble length) in place \nof the length which it now possesses, in the manner in which I can at\nwill pre-determine its direction. The theoretical possibility of a \ndetermination of length by adjustment is given as a consequence of \nthe world-curvature, which arises from the metrical field \naccording to a complicated mathematical law. As a result of its \nconstitution, the measuring-rod assumes a length which possesses this\nor that value, in relation to the radius of curvature of the \nfield. \n\nWeyl’s response to Einstein’s criticism that a Weyl geometry \nconflicts with experience, took advantage of the fact that the \nunderlying dynamical laws of matter which govern clocks and rigid \nrods, were not known at that time. Weyl could thus argue that it is \nat least theoretically possible that there exists an \nunderlying dynamics of matter, such that a Weyl geometry, according \nto which length transfer is non-integrable, nonetheless coheres with \nobservable experience, according to which length transfer \nappears to be integrable. However, as was clearly pointed \nout by Wolfgang Pauli, Weyl’s plausible defence comes at a \n cost.[49]\n Pauli (1921/1958, 196) argued that Weyl’s defence of his theory \ndeprives it of its inherent convincing power from a physical point of\nview.  \n\nWeyl’s present attitude to this problem is the\nfollowing: The ideal process of the congruent transference of\nworld lengths … has nothing to do with the real behaviour of\nmeasuring rods and clocks; the metric field must not be defined by\nmeans of information taken from these measuring instruments. In\nthis case the quantities \\(g_{ik}\\) and \\(\\varphi_{i}\\) are, be\ndefinition, no longer observable, in contrast to the line elements of\nEinstein’s theory. This relinquishment seems to have very\nserious consequences. While there now no longer exists a direct\ncontradiction with experiment, the theory appears nevertheless to have\nbeen robbed of its inherent convincing power, from a physical point of\nview. For instance, the connexion between electromagnetism and world\nmetric is not now essentially physical, but purely formal. For there\nis no longer an immediate connection between the electromagnetic\nphenomena and the behaviour of measuring rods and clocks. There is\nonly an interrelation between the former and the ideal process which\nis mathematically defined as congruent transference of\nvectors. Besides, there exists only formal, and not physical, evidence\nfor a connection between world metric and\nelectricity.[50] \n\nPauli concluded his critical assessment of Weyl’s theory with the \nfollowing statement:  \n\nSummarizing, we can say that Weyl’s theory has not succeeded in \ngetting any nearer to solving the problem of the structure \nof matter. As will be argued in more detail … there is, \non the contrary, something to be said for the view that a solution of\nthis problem cannot at all be found in this way. \n\nIt should be noted, however, that Weyl’s defence of his theory \nimplicitly addresses an important methodological consideration \nconcerning the relation between theory and evidence. As Pauli puts it\nabove, according to Weyl “the metric field must not be \ndefined by means of information taken from these measuring \ninstruments [rigid rods and ideal clocks]”. That is, \nWeyl rejects Einstein’s operational standpoint which gives \noperational significance to the metric field in terms of the\nobservable behaviour of ideal rigid rods and ideal \n clocks.[51]\n Unlike light propagation and freely falling (spherically symmetric, \nneutral) particles, rigid rods and ideal clocks are relativistically \nill defined probative systems, and are thus unsuitable for the \ndetermination of the inherent structures of spacetime postulated by \nthe theory of relativity. Weyl (1918a) clearly recognized this when \nhe said in response to Einstein’s critique “because of the \nproblematic behaviour of yardsticks and clocks I have in my book \nSpace-Time-Matter restricted myself for the specific \nmeasurement of the \\(g_{ik}\\), exclusively to the \nobservation of the arrival of light signals.” It is interesting\nto note parenthetically that in the first edition of his book Weyl \nthought that it was possible to have an intrinsic method of comparing\nthe lengths of arbitrary spacetime intervals with an interval between\ntwo fiducial spacetime events, by using light signals only. It was \nLorentz who pointed out to Weyl that not only the world lines of \nlight rays but also the world lines of material bodies are required \nfor an intrinsic method of comparing lengths. Not only did Weyl \ncorrect this mistake in subsequent editions, but already in 1921, \nWeyl (1921c) discovered the causal-inertial method for determining \nthe spacetime metric (see §4.3) by proving an important theorem \nthat shows that the spacetime metric is already fully determined by \nthe inertial and causal structure of spacetime. Weyl (1949a, 103) \nremarks “… therefore mensuration need not depend on \nclocks and rigid bodies but … light signals and mass points \nmoving under the influence of inertia alone will suffice.” It \nis clear that Weyl regarded the use of clocks and rigid rods as an \nundesirable makeshift within the context of the special and general \ntheory. Since neither spatial nor temporal intervals are invariants \nof spacetime, the invariant spacetime interval \\(ds\\) cannot be \ndirectly ascertained by means of standard clocks and rigid rods. In \naddition, the latter presuppose quantum theoretical principles for \ntheir justification and therefore lie outside the relativistic \nframework because the laws which govern their physical processes are \nnot \n known.[52] \n\nWeyl (1929c, 233) abandoned his unified field theory only with the \nadvent of the quantum theory of the electron. He did so because in \nthat theory a different kind of gauge invariance associated with \nDirac’s theory of the electron was discovered, which more adequately \naccounted for the conservation of electric charge. Weyl’s \ncontributions to quantum mechanics, and his construction of a new \nprinciple of gauge invariance, are discussed in \n §4.5.3.[53] \n\nWeyl’s unified field theory was revived by Dirac (1973) in a slightly\nmodified form, which incorporated a real scalar field \n\\(\\beta(x)\\). Dirac also argued that the time intervals measured \nby atomic clocks need not be identified with the lengths of timelike \nvectors in the Weyl \n geometry.[54] \n\nPrior to the works of Gauss, Grassmann and Riemann, the study of \ngeometry tended to emphasize the employment of empirical intuitions \nand images of the three dimensional physical space. Physical space \nwas thought of as having definite metrical attributes. The task of \nthe geometer was to take physical mensuration devices in that space \nand work with them.  \n\nUnder the influence of Gauss and Grassmann, Riemann’s great \nphilosophical contribution consisted in the demonstration that, \nunlike the case of a discrete manifold, where the determination of a \nset necessarily implies the determination of its quantity or cardinal\nnumber, in the case of a continuous manifold, the concept of such a \nmanifold and of its continuity properties, can be separated form its \nmetrical structure. Using modern terminology, Riemann separated a \nmanifold’s local differential topological structure from its metrical\nstructure. Thus Riemann’s separation thesis gave rise to the \nspace problem, or as Weyl called it, das \nRaumproblem: how can metric relations be determined on a \ncontinuous manifold \\(M\\)?  \n\nA metric manifold is a manifold on which a distance function \n\\(f : M \\times M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) is defined. Such a \ndistance function must satisfy the following minimal conditions: for \nall \\(p, q, r \\in M\\),  \n\nIn his famous inaugural lecture at Göttingen, entitled \nÜber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu \nGrunde liegen (About the hypotheses which lie at the \nbasis of geometry), Riemann (1854) examined how metric relations\ncan be determined on a continuous manifold; that is, what specific \nform \\(f : M \\times M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) should \nhave. Consider the coordinates \\(x^{i}(p)\\) \nand \\(x^{i} (p) + dx^{i} (p)\\) of two neighboring \npoints \\(p, q \\in M\\). The measure of the \ndistance \\(ds = f(p,q)\\) must \nbe some function \\(F_{p}\\) at \\(p\\) of the \ndifferential increments \\(dx^{i}(p)\\); that is,  \n\nRiemann states that \\(F_{p}\\) should satisfy the \nfollowing requirements:  \nFunctional Homogeneity: If \\(\\lambda \\gt 0\\) and \n\\(ds = F_{p}(dx(p))\\), then \nSign Invariance: A change in sign of the \ndifferentials should leave the value of \\(ds\\) invariant. \n\nSign invariance is satisfied by every positive homogeneous function \nof degree \\(2m\\) \\((m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots)\\). In the simple \ncase \\(m = 1\\), and the length element \\(ds\\) is the square \nroot of a homogeneous function of second degree, which can be \nexpressed in the standard form  \n\nThat is, at each point of \\(M\\) there exists a coordinate system \n(defined up to an element of the orthogonal group \\(O(n)\\) \nin which the square root of the homogeneous function of second degree\ncan be expressed in the above standard form. Riemann’s well-known \ngeneral expression for the measure of length at \\(p \\in M\\) with \nrespect to an arbitrary coordinate system is given by  \n\nwhere the components of the metric tensor satisfy the symmetry \ncondition \\(g_{ij} = g_{ji}\\).  \n\nThe assumption that \\(ds^{2} = F^{2}_{p}\\) is a \nquadratic differential form is not only the simplest one, but also \nthe preferred one for other important reasons. Riemann himself was \nwell aware of other possibilities; for example, the possibility that \n\\(ds\\) could be the 4th root of a homogeneous polynomial of 4th \norder in the differentials. But Riemann restricted himself to the \nspecial case \\(m = 1\\) because he was pressed for time and because he \nwanted to give specific geometric interpretations of his results. As \nWeyl points out Riemann’s own answer to the space problem is \ninadequate since Riemann’s mathematical justification for the \nrestriction to the Pythagorean case are not very compelling. The \nfirst satisfactory justification of the Pythagorean form of the \nRiemannian metric, although limited in scope because it presupposed \nthe full homogeneity of Euclidean space, was provided by the \ninvestigations of Hermann von Helmholtz. Helmholtz diverged from \nRiemann’s analytic approach and made use merely of the fundamental \nconcept of geometry, namely, the concept of congruent \nmapping, and characterized the geometric structure of space by \nrequiring of space the full homogeneity of Euclidean space. His \nanalysis was thereby restricted to the cases of constant positive, \nzero, or negative curvature. Abstracting from our experience of the \nmovement of rigid bodies, Helmholtz was able to mathematically derive\nRiemann’s distance formula from a number of axioms about rigid body \nmotion in space. Helmholtz (1868) argued that Riemann’s hypothesis \nthat the metric structure of space is determined locally by a \nquadratic differential form, is really a consequence of the facts \n(Tatsachen) of rigid-body motion.  \n\nConsidering the general case of \\(n\\) dimensions, and using Lie \ngroups and Lie algebras, Sophus Lie, (Lie (1886/1935, 1890a,b)), \nlater developed and improved Helmholtz’s justification. However, the \nHelmholtz-Lie treatment of, and solution to, the problem of space, \nlost its relevance with the arrival of Einstein’s theory of general \nrelativity. As Weyl (1922b) points out, instead of a \nthree-dimensional continuum we must now consider a four-dimensional \ncontinuum, the metric of which is not positive definite but \nis given instead by an indefinite quadratic form. In \naddition, Helmholtz’s presupposition of metric homogeneity no longer \nholds, since we are now dealing with an inhomogeneous metric field \nthat causally depends on the distribution of matter. Consequently, \nWeyl provided a reformulation of the space problem that is compatible\nwith the causal and metric structures postulated by the theory of \ngeneral relativity. But Weyl went further. Such a reformulation \nshould not only incorporate Riemann’s infinitesimal \nstandpoint, as required by Einstein’s general theory, it should also \ncohere with Weyl’s requirements of a pure \ninfinitesimal geometry developed earlier in the \ncontext of Weyl’s construction of a unified field theory.  \n\nMore precisely, Weyl generalized the so-called \nRiemann-Helmholtz-Lie problem of space in two ways: First, \nhe allowed for indefinite metrics in order to encompass the \ngeneral theory of relativity. Secondly, he considered metrics with \nvariable gauge \\(\\lambda(x(p))\\) together with an \nassociated length connection, in order to obtain a \npurely infinitesimal geometry. Thus each member of a general\nclass of geometries under consideration is locally determined \nrelative to a choice of variable gauge by two structural fields \n(Strukturfelder): (1) a possibly indefinite Finsler metric \n field[55]\n \\(F_{p}(dx)\\), and (2) a length connection that is\ndetermined by a 1-form field \\(\\theta_{i}dx^{i}\\). Weyl’s task\nwas to prove:  \n\nIf the geometry satisfies the Postulate of Freedom, (the \nnature of space imposes no restrictions on admissible metrical \nrelations), and determines a unique, symmetric, linear connection \n\\(\\Gamma\\), then the Finsler metric field \n\\(F_{p}(dx)\\) must be a Riemannian metric field of \nsome \n signature.[56] \n\nIn a Riemannian space the concept of parallel displacement is defined\nby two conditions:  \n\nIt follows from these conditions that a Riemannian space possesses a \ndefinite symmetric linear connection—a symmetric linear \nmetric \n connection[58]—which\n is uniquely determined by the Pythagorean-Riemannian metric. Weyl \ncalls this:  \nThe Fundamental Postulate of Riemannian Geometry: Among the possible systems of parallel displacements of a\nvector to infinitely near points, that is among the possible \nsets of symmetric linear connection coefficients, there exists \none and only one set, and hence one and only one system of parallel \ndisplacement, which is length preserving. \n\nIn his \n lectures[59]\n on the mathematical analysis of the problem of space delivered in \n1922 at Barcelona and Madrid, Weyl sketched a proof demonstrating \nthat the following is also true:  \nUniqueness of the Pythagorean-Riemannian Metric: \nAmong all the possible infinitesimal metrics that can be put on a\ndifferentiable manifold, the Pythagorean-Riemannian metric is the only\ntype of metric that uniquely determines a symmetric linear\nconnection. \n\nWeyl begins his proof with two natural assumptions. First, the \nnature of the metric should be coordinate independent. If \n\\(ds\\) is given by an expression \n\\(F_{p}(dx^{1}, \\ldots ,dx^{n})\\) with respect to a given system \nof coordinates, then with respect to another system of coordinates, \n\\(ds\\) is given by a function that is related to \n\\(F_{p}(dx^{1}, \\ldots ,dx^{n})\\) by a linear, homogeneous \ntransformation of its arguments \\(dx^{i}\\). \nSecond, it is reasonable to assume that the nature of the \nmetric is the same everywhere, in the sense that at every point of \nthe manifold, and with respect to every coordinate system for a \nneighborhood of the point in question, \\(ds\\) is represented by an\nelement of the equivalence class \\([F]\\) of functions generated by\nany one such function, say \n\\(F_{p}(dx^{1}, \\ldots ,dx^{n})\\), by all linear, homogeneous \ntransformations of its arguments \\(dx^{i}\\).\n \n\nFor the case in which \\(F_{p}\\) is Pythagorean in \nform, namely the square root of a positive-definite quadratic form, \nthere exists just one possible equivalence class [\\(F\\)], because \nevery function that is the square root of a positive-definite \nquadratic form can be transformed to the standard expression  \n\nby means of a linear, homogeneous transformation.  \n\nTo every possible equivalence class [\\(F\\)] of homogeneous \nfunctions, there corresponds a type of metrical space. The \nPythagorean-Riemannian space, for which \n\\(F^{2}_{p} = (dx^{1})^{2} + \\cdots + (dx^{n})^{2}\\), is one among \nseveral types of possible metrical spaces. The problem, therefore, is\nto single out the equivalence class \\([F]\\), where \\(F\\) \ncorresponds to \n\\(F^{2}_{p} = (dx^{1})^{2} + \\cdots + (dx^{n})^{2}\\), from the other \npossibilities, and to provide arguments for this preference.  \n\nBy the term ‘metric’ Weyl means any \ninfinitesimal distance function \n\\(F_{p} \\in [F]\\), where the equivalence \nclass \\([F]\\) represents a type of metric structure or \nmetric field. Any such type of metric field structure has a \nmicrosymmetry group \\(G_{p}\\) at each \\(p \\in M\\).  \nDefinition 4.1 (Microsymmetry Group)\nA microsymmetry of a structural field (Strukturfeld) at a point \\(p\n\\in M\\) is a local diffeomorphism that takes \\(p \\in M\\) into \\(p\\)\nand preserves the structural field at \\(p \\in M\\).  The microsymmetry\ngroup of a field at \\(p \\in M\\) is the group of its microsymmetries at\n\\(p \\in M\\) under the operation of composition.\n \n\nA microsymmetry group \\(G_{p}\\), at \\(p \\in M\\), of a metric\nstructure, is a set of invertible, linear maps of the tangent space\n\\(T(M_{p})\\) onto itself, which preserve the infinitesimal distance\nfunction at \\(p \\in M\\). For every \\(p \\in M, G_{p}\\) is isomorphic to\none and the same abstract group.  \n\nFor a Riemannian type of metric structure the congruent linear maps \nof the tangent space T\\((M_{p})\\) onto itself form \na group \\(G_{p}\\) which is isomorphic to the \northogonal group \\(O(n)\\). The Pythagorean-Riemannian \nmetric at \\(p\\) is therefore determined through the concrete \nrealization of the orthogonal group at \\(p\\) which leaves\nthe fundamental quadratic differential form at \\(p\\) invariant. \nThus the Pythagorean-Riemannian type of metric is \ncharacterized by the abstract microsymmetry group \\(O(n)\\).\nFor a metric which is not of the Pythagorean-Riemannian metric type, \nthe abstract microsymmetry group \\(G_{p}\\) will be \ndifferent from \\(O(n)\\) and will be some other subgroup of \n\\(GL(n)\\). At each point of the manifold the microsymmetry \ngroup will be a concrete realization of this subgroup of \n\\(GL(n)\\). Weyl now states what he calls  \nThe Postulate of Freedom:\nIf only the nature (of whatever type) of the metric is\nspecified, that is, if only the corresponding abstract microsymmetry\ngroup \\(G_{p}\\) is specified, and the metric in\nquestion is otherwise left arbitrary, then the mutual\norientations of the corresponding microsymmetry groups at\ndifferent points are also left arbitrary. \n\nWeyl emphasizes that the Postulate of Freedom provides the \ngeneral framework for a concise formulation of  \nThe Hypothesis of Dynamical Geometry:\nWhatever the nature or type of the metric may be—provided it\nis the same everywhere—the variations in the mutual\norientations of the concrete microsymmetry groups from point to\npoint are causally determined by the material content that fills\nspace. \n\nIn contrast with Helmholtz’s analysis, which presupposes the \nhomogeneity of space, the Postulate of Freedom allows for \nthe possibility of replacing Helmholtz’s homogeneity requirement with\nthe possibility of subjecting the metric field to arbitrary, \ninfinitesimal change. To assert this dynamical possibility does \nnot require that the nature of the metric be specified.  \n\nNext, Weyl points out that what has been provided so far is merely an\nexplication of the concepts metric, length \nconnection and symmetric linear connection. Some \nclaim which goes beyond conceptual analysis has to be made, according\nto Weyl, in order to prove that among the various types of possible \nmetrical structures that can be put on a differentiable manifold \nrepresenting physical space, the Pythagorean-Riemannian form is \nunique. Weyl suggests the following hypothesis:  \nWeyl’s Hypothesis:\nWhatever determination the essentially free length connection at some\npoint \\(p\\) of the manifold may realize with the points in its\ninfinitesimal neighborhood, there always exists among the possible\nsystems of parallel displacements of the tangent space\n\\(T(M_{p})\\), one and only one, which is at the same\ntime a system of infinitesimal congruent transport.\n \n\nWeyl shows that this hypothesis does in fact single out metrics of \nthe Pythagorean-Riemannian type by proving the following theorem:  \nTheorem 4.2\nIf a specific length connection is such that it determines a unique\nsymmetric linear connection, then the metric must be of the\nPythagorean-Riemannian form (for some signature). \n\nThus the Postulate of Freedom and Weyl’s\nHypothesis together entail the existence, at each \\(p \\in M\\), of\na non-degenerate quadratic form that is unique up to a choice of gauge\nat \\(p \\in M\\), and that is invariant under the action of the\nmicrosymmetry group \\(G_{p}\\) that is isomorphic to an orthogonal\ngroup of some signature.  \n\nThis formulation suggests, according to Weyl, an intuitive contrast \nbetween Euclidean ‘distance-geometry’ and the \n‘near-geometry’ (Nahegeometrie) or \n‘field-geometry’ of Riemann. Weyl (1949a, 88) \ncompared Euclidean ‘distance-geometry’ to a crystal \n“built up from uniform unchangeable atoms in the rigid and \nunchangeable arrangement of a lattice”, and the latter \n[Riemannian field-geometry] to a liquid, “consisting \nof the same indiscernible unchangeable atoms, whose arrangement and \norientation, however, are mobile and yielding to forces acting upon \nthem.”  \n\nThe nature of the metric field, that is the nature \nof the metric everywhere, is the same and is, therefore, \nabsolutely determined. It reflects according to Weyl, the a \npriori structure of space or spacetime. In contrast, what is \nposteriori, that is, accidental and capable of continuous \nchange being causally dependent on the material content that fills \nspace, are the mutual orientations of the metrics at \ndifferent points. Hence, the demarcation between the \\(a\\) \npriori and the a posteriori has shifted, according \nto Weyl: Euclidean geometry is still preserved for the infinitesimal \nneighborhood of any given point, but the coordinate system in which \nthe metrical law assumes the standard form \n\\(ds^{2} =\\sum^{n}_{i=1}(dx^{i})^{2}\\)\nis in general different from place to place.  \n\nWeyl’s a priori and a posteriori distinction must \nnot be confused with Kant’s distinction. Weyl (1949a, 134) remarks: \n“In the case of physical space it is possible to \ncounterdistinguish aprioristic and aposterioristic features in a \ncertain objective sense without, like Kant, referring to their \ncognitive source or their cognitive character.” Weyl makes the \nsame remark in (Weyl, 1922b, 266). See also the discussion in \n§4.5.8.  \n\nIn the context of his group-theoretical analysis, Weyl (1922b, p. \n266) makes the following interesting and important statement:  \n\nI remark from an epistemological point of view: it is not correct to \nsay that space or the world [spacetime] is in itself, prior to any \nmaterial content, merely a formless continuous manifold in the sense \nof analysis situs; the nature of the metric [its \ninfinitesimal Pythagorean-Riemannian character] is characteristic of \nspace in itself, only the mutual orientation of the metrics at the \nvarious points is contingent, a posteriori and dependent on the \nmaterial content. \n\nWithin the context of general relativity, empty spacetime is \nimpossible, if ‘empty’ is understood to mean not merely \nempty of all matter but also empty of all fields. \nAt another place, Weyl (1949a, Engl. edn, 172) says:  \n\nGeometry unites organically with the field theory; space is not \nopposed to things (as it is in substance theory) like an empty vessel\ninto which they are placed and which endows them with far-geometrical\nrelationships. No empty space exists here; the assumption that the \nfield omits a portion of the space is absurd. \n\nAccording to Weyl, the metric field does not cease to exist in a world\ndevoid of matter but is in a state of rest: As a rest field\nit would possess the property of metric homogeneity; the\nmutual orientations of the orthogonal groups\ncharacterizing the Pythagorean-Riemannian nature of the metric\neverywhere would not differ from point to point. This means that\nin a matter-empty universe the metric is fixed. Consequently, the set\nof congruence relations on spacetime is uniquely determined.\nSince the metric uniquely determines the symmetric linear connection,\nthe homogeneous metric field (rest field) determines\nan integrable affine structure. Therefore, a flat Minkowski\nspacetime consistent with the complete absence of matter is endowed\nwith an integrable connection and thus determines all\n(hypothetical) free motions. According to Weyl, there exists in the\nabsence of matter a homogeneous metric field, a structural field\n(Strukturfeld), which has the character of a rest\nfield, and which constitutes an all pervasive background that cannot\nbe eliminated. The structure of this rest field determines\nthe extension of the spacetime congruence relations and\ndetermines Lorentz invariance. The rest\nfield possesses no net energy and makes no contribution to \ncurvature.  \n\nThe contrast with Helmholtz and Lie is this: both of them require \nhomogeneity and isotropy for physical space. From a general \nRiemannian standpoint, the latter characteristics are valid only for \na matter-empty universe. Such a universe is flat and Euclidean, \nwhereas a universe that contains matter is inhomogeneous, \nanisotropic and of variable curvature.  \n\nIt is important to note here that the validity of Weyl’s assertion \nthat the metric field does not cease to exist but is in a state of \nrest, has its source in the mathematical fact that the metric field \nis a \\(G\\)-structure. A \\(G\\)-structure may be flat or non-flat; but a \n\\(G\\)-structure can never vanish. Consequently, geometric fields \ncharacterizable as \\(G\\)-structures, such as the projective, conformal, \naffine and metric structures, do not \n vanish.[60] \n\nRiemann searched for the most general type of an \\(n\\)-dimensional\nmanifold. On this manifold, Euclidean geometry turns out to be a \nspecial case resulting from a certain form of the metric. Weyl takes \nthis general structure, the manifold structure, which has certain \ncontinuity and order properties, as basic, but leaves the \ndetermination of the other geometrical structures, such as the \nprojective, conformal, affine and metric structures, open. The \nmetrical axioms are no longer dictated, as they were for Kant, by \npure intuition. According to Weyl (1949a, 87), for Riemann the metric\nis not, as it was for Kant, “part of the static homogeneous \nform of phenomena, but of their ever changing material \ncontent”. Weyl (1931a, 338) says:  \n\nWe differentiate now between the amorphous continuum and its metrical\nstructure. The first has retained its a priori \n character,[61]\n … whereas the structural field [Strukturfeld] is completely \nsubjected to the power-play of the world; being a real entity, \nEinstein prefers to call it the ether. \n\nThere is no indication in Riemann’s work on gravitation and\nelectromagnetism that would indicate that he anticipated the\nconceptual revolution underlying Einstein’s theory. However,\nWeyl’s interpretation of Riemann’s work suggests that\nRiemann foresaw something like its possibility in the following\nsense:  \n\nBy formally separating the post-topological structures such as the \naffine, projective, conformal and metric structures from the \nmanifold, so that these structures are no longer rigidly tied to it, \nRiemann deprived them of their formal geometric rigidity and, on the \nbasis of his infinitesimal geometric standpoint or \n“near-geometry”, allowed for the possibility of \ninterpreting them as mathematical representations of flexible, \ndynamical physical structural fields [Strukturfelder] on the manifold\nof spacetime, geometrical fields that reciprocally interact with \nmatter. \n\nRiemann’s separation thesis together with his adoption of the \ninfinitesimal standpoint, were prerequisite steps for the development\nof differential geometry as the mathematics of differentiable \ngeometric fields on manifolds. When interpreted physically, these \nmathematical structures or geometrical fields correspond, as Weyl \nsays, to physical structural fields (Strukturfelder). Analogous to \nthe electromagnetic field, these structural fields act on matter and \nare in turn acted on by matter. Weyl (1931a, 337) remarks:  \n\nI now come to the crucial idea of the theory of General Relativity. \nWhatever exerts as powerful and real effects as does the\nmetric structure of the world, cannot be a rigid, once and for \nall, fixed geometrical structure of the world, but must \nitself be something real which not only exerts effects on \nmatter but which in turn suffers them through matter. Riemann \nalready suggested for space the idea that the structural field, like \nthe electromagnetic field, reciprocally interacts with matter. \n\nWeyl (1931a, 338) continues:  \n\nWe already explained with the example of inertia, that the structural\nfield [Strukturfeld] must, as a close-action [Nahewirkung], be \nunderstood infinitesimally. How this can occur with the metric \nstructure of space, Riemann abstracted from Gauss’s theory of curved \nsurfaces. \n\nThe various geometrical fields are not “intrinsic” to the\nmanifold structure of spacetime. The manifold represents an amorphous\nfour-dimensional differentiable continuum in the sense of \nanalysis situs and has no properties besides those that fall\nunder the concept of a manifold.  \n\nThe amorphous four-dimensional differentiable manifold possesses a \nhigh degree of symmetry. Because of its homogeneity, all points are \nalike; there are no objective geometric properties that enable one to\ndistinguish one point from another. This full homogeneity or symmetry\nof space must be described by its group of automorphisms, \nthe one-to-one mappings of the point field onto itself which leave \nall relations of objective significance between points undisturbed. \nIf a geometric object \\(F\\), that is a point set with a definite \nrelational structure is given, then those automorphisms of space that\nleave \\(F\\) invariant, constitute a group and this group describes\nexactly the symmetry which \\(F\\) possesses. For instance, to use \nan example by Weyl (1938b) (see also Weyl (1949a, 72–73) and \nWeyl (1952)), if \n\\(R(p_{1},p_{2},p_{3})\\) is a ternary relation that asserts \n\\(p_{1},p_{2},p_{3}\\)\nlie on a straight line, then we require that any three points, \nsatisfying this relation \\(R\\), are mapped by an automorphism into\nthree other points \n\\(p_{1}',p_{2}',p_{3}'\\),\nfulfilling the same relation.  \n\nThe group of automorphisms of the \\(n\\)-dimensional number space \ncontains only the identity map, since all numbers of \n\\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) are distinct individuals. It is \nessentially for this reason that the real numbers are used for \ncoordinate descriptions. Whereas the continuum of real numbers \nconsists of individuals, the continua of space, time, and spacetime \nare homogeneous. Spacetime points do not admit of an absolute \ncharacterization; they can be distinguished, according to Weyl, only \nby “a demonstrative act, by pointing and saying \nhere-now”.  \n\nIn a little book entitled Riemanns geometrische Ideen, ihre \nAuswirkung und ihre Verknüpfung mit \nder Gruppentheorie, published posthumously in 1988, Weyl (1988, \n4–5) makes this interesting comment:  \n\nCoordinates are introduced on the Mf [manifold] in the most direct \nway through the mapping onto the number space, in such a way, that \nall coordinates, which arise through one-to-one continuous \ntransformations, are equally possible. With this the coordinate \nconcept breaks loose from all special constructions to which it was \nbound earlier in geometry. In the language of relativity this means: \nThe coordinates are not measured, their values are not read off from \nreal measuring rods which react in a definite way to physical fields \nand the metrical structure, rather they are a priori placed in the \nworld arbitrarily, in order to characterize those physical fields \nincluding the metric structure numerically. The metric structure \nbecomes through this, so to speak, freed from space; it becomes an \nexisting field within the remaining structure-less space. Through \nthis, space as form of appearance contrasts more clearly with its \nreal content: The content is measured after the form is arbitrarily \nrelated to coordinates. \n\nBy mapping a given spacetime homeomorphically onto the real number \nspace, providing through the arbitrariness of the mapping, what Weyl \ncalls, a qualitatively non-differentiated field of free \npossibilities—the continuum of all possible \ncoincidences—we represent spacetime points by their coordinates\ncorresponding to some coordinate system. The four-dimensional \narithmetical space can be utilized as a four-dimensional schema for \nthe localization of events of all possible “here-nows”.  \n\nPhysical dynamical quantities in spacetime, such as the geometrical \nstructural fields on the four-dimensional spacetime continuum, are \ndescribable as functions of a variable point which ranges over the \nfour-dimensional number space \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\). Instead of \nthinking of the spacetime points as real substantival entities, and \nany talk of fields as just a convenient way of describing geometrical\nrelations between points, one thinks of the geometrical fields such \nas the projective, conformal causal, affine and metric fields, as \nreal physical entities with dynamical properties, such as energy, \nmomentum and angular momentum, and the field points as mere \nmathematical abstractions. Spacetime is not a medium in the sense of \nthe old ether concept. No ether in that sense exists here. Just as \nthe electromagnetic fields are not states of a medium but constitute \nindependent realities which are not reducible to anything else, so, \naccording to Weyl, the geometrical fields are independent irreducible\nphysical \n fields.[62] \n\nA class of geometric structural fields of a given type is \ncharacterized by a particular Lie group. A geometric structural field\nbelonging to a given class has a microsymmetry group (see definition \n4.1) at each point \\(p \\in M\\) which is isomorphic to \nthe Lie group that is characteristic of the class. In relativity \ntheory, this microsymmetry group is isomorphic to the Lorentz group \nand leaves invariant a pseudo-Riemannian metric of Lorentzian \nsignature.  \n\nThe different types of geometric, structural fields may be \nrepresented from a modern mathematical point of view as cross \nsections of appropriate fiber bundles over the manifold \\(M\\); \nthat is, the amorphous manifold \\(M\\) has associated with it \nvarious geometric fields in terms of a mapping of a certain kind \n(called a cross section) from the manifold \\(M\\) to the \ncorresponding bundle space over \n \\(M\\).[63]\n In particular, Einstein’s general theory of relativity postulates a \nphysical field, the metrical field, which, mathematically speaking, \nmay be characterized as a cross section of the bundle of \nnon-degenerate, second-order, symmetric, covariant tensors of Lorentz\nsignature over \\(M\\). Weyl (1931a, 336) says of this world \nstructure:  \n\nHowever this structure is to be exactly and completely described and \nwhatever its inner ground might be, all laws of nature show that it \nconstitutes the most decisive influence on the evolution of physical \nevents: the behavior of rigid bodies and clocks is almost exclusively\ndetermined through the metric structure, as is the pattern of the \nmotion of a force-free mass point and the propagation of a light \nsource. And only through these effects on the concrete natural \nprocesses can we recognize this structure. \n\nThe views of Weyl are diametrically opposed to geometrical\nconventionalism and some forms of relationalism. According to Weyl,\nwe discover through the behavior of physical phenomena an\nalready determined metrical structure of spacetime. The metrical\nrelations of physical objects are determined by a physical field, the\nmetric field, which is represented by the second rank metric tensor\nfield. Contrary to geometric conventionalism, spacetime geometry is\nnot about rigid rods, ideal clocks, light rays or freely falling\nparticles, except in the derivative sense of providing information\nabout the physically real metric field which, according to Weyl, is as\nphysically real as is the electromagnetic field, and which determines\nand explains the metrical behavior of congruence standards under\ntransport. The metrical field has physical and metrical\nsignificance, and the metrical significance does not consist in the\nmere articulation of relations obtaining between, say, rigid rods or\nideal clocks.  \n\nThe special and general, as well as the non-relativistic spacetime \ntheories postulate various structural constraints which events are \nheld to satisfy. When interpreted physically, these mathematical \nstructures or constraints correspond to physical structural fields \n(Strukturfelder). Analogous to the electromagnetic field, \nthese structural fields act on matter and are, within the context of \nthe general theory of relativity, in turn acted on by matter. An \n\\(n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\) whose sole properties are \nthose that fall under the concept of a manifold, Weyl (1918b) \nphysically interprets as an \\(n\\)-dimensional empty world, that \nis, a world empty of both matter and fields. On the other hand, an \n\\(n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\) that is an affinely connected \nmanifold, Weyl physically interprets as an \\(n\\)-dimensional world\nfilled with a gravitational field, and an \\(n\\)-dimensional \nmanifold \\(M\\) endowed with a projective structure represents an \n\\(n\\)-dimensional non-empty world filled with an \ninertial-gravitational field, or what Weyl calls the guiding \nfield Führungsfeld). In a \nsimilar vein, an \\(n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\) that \npossesses a conformal structure of Lorentz type, represents a \nnon-empty \\(n\\)-dimensional world filled with a causal field. \nFinally, an \\(n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\) endowed with a \nmetrical structure may be interpreted physically as an \n\\(n\\)-dimensional non-empty world filled with a metric field.  \n\nThe mathematical model of physical spacetime is the four-dimensional \npseudo-Riemannian manifold. Weyl (1921c) distinguished between two \nprimitive substructures of that model: the conformal and \nprojective structures and showed that the conformal \nstructure, modelling the causal field governing light \npropagation, and the projective structure, modelling the inertial or \nguiding field governing all free (fall) motions, uniquely \ndetermine the metric. That is, Weyl (1921c) proved  \nTheorem 4.3\nThe projective and conformal structure of a metric space determine the\nmetric uniquely. \n\nA metric \\(g\\) on a manifold determines a first-order conformal \nstructure on the manifold, namely, an equivalence class of \nconformally related metrics  \n\nA metric \\(g\\) also uniquely determines a symmetric linear \nconnection \\(\\Gamma\\) on the manifold. Under a conformal transformation  \n\nthe change of the components of the symmetric linear connection is \ngiven by (14), that is,  \n\nThus the set of all arbitrary conformal transformations of the metric\ninduces an equivalence class \\(K\\) of conformally related \nsymmetric linear connections. This equivalence class \\(K\\) \nconstitutes a second-order conformal structure on the manifold and \nthe difference between any two connections in the equivalence class \nis given by (29). Weyl shows that a conformal transformation (29) \npreserves the projective structure and hence is a projective \ntransformation (that is, a conformal transformation which also \nsatisfies (7)), if and only if \\(\\theta_{j} = 0\\), in \nwhich case the conformal and projective structures are compatible. \nWeyl remarks after the proof:  \n\nIf it is possible for us, in the real world, to discern causal \npropagation, and in particular light propagation, and if moreover, we\nare able to recognize and observe as such the motion of free mass \npoints which follow the guiding field, then we are able to read off \nthe metric field from this alone, without reliance on clocks and \nrigid rods. \n\nElsewhere, Weyl (1949a, 103) says:  \n\nAs a matter of fact it can be shown that the metrical structure of \nthe world is already fully determined by its inertial and causal \nstructure, that therefore mensuration need not depend on clocks and \nrigid bodies but that light signals and mass points moving under the \ninfluence of inertia alone will suffice. \n\nThe use of clocks and rigid rods is, within the context of either \ntheory, an undesirable makeshift for two reasons. First, since \nneither spatial nor temporal intervals are invariants of the \nfour-dimensional spacetime of the special theory of relativity and \nthe general theory of relativity, the invariant spacetime interval \n\\(ds\\) cannot be directly ascertained by means of standard clocks \nand rigid rods. Second, the concepts of a rigid body and a periodic \nsystem (such as pendulums or atomic clocks) are not fundamental or \ntheoretically self-sufficient, but involve assumptions that \npresuppose quantum theoretical principles for their justification and\nthus lie outside the present conceptual relativistic framework. \nTherefore, methodological and ontological considerations decidedly \nfavor Weyl’s causal-inertial method for determining the spacetime \nmetric.  \n\nFrom the physical point of view, Weyl emphasized the roles of light \npropagation and free (fall) motion in revealing the conformal-causal \nand the projective structures respectively. However, from the \nmathematical point of view, Weyl did not use these two structures \ndirectly in order to derive from them and their compatibility \nrelation, the metric field. Rather, Weyl regarded the metric and \naffine structures as fundamental and showed that the conformal and \nthe projective structures respectively arise from those structures by\nmathematical abstraction.  Figure 7:\nWeyl took the metric and affines structures as fundamental and showed\nthat the conformal and projective structures respectively arise from\nthem by mathematical abstraction. \n\nEhlers et al. (1972) generalized Weyl’s causal-inertial method by \nderiving the metric field directly from the conformal and \nprojective fields and derived a unique pseudo-Riemannian spacetime \nmetric solely as a consequence of a set of natural, physically \nwell-motivated, constructive, “geometry-free” axioms \nconcerning the incidence and differential properties of light \npropagation and free (fall) motion. Ehlers, Pirani and Schild adopt \nReichenbach’s (1924) term, constructive axiomatics to \ndescribe the nature of their approach. The \n“geometry-free” axioms are propositions about a few \ngeneral qualitative assumptions concerning free (fall) motion and \nlight propagation that can be verified directly through experience in\na way that does not presuppose the full blown edifice of the general \ntheory of relativity. From these axioms, the theoretical basis of the\ntheory is reconstructed step by step.  \n\nThe constructive axiomatic approach to spacetime structure is roughly\nthis:  \n\nPrimitive Notions. The constructive axiomatic \napproach is based on a triple of sets \n\nof objects corresponding respectively to the notions of events, \nparticle paths and light rays, which are taken as \nprimitive. The set \\(M\\) of events is assumed to have a Hausdorff \ntopology with a countable basis in order to state local axioms \nthrough the use of such terms as “neighborhood”. Members \nof the sets \\(\\mathcal{P} = \\{P, Q, P_{1}, Q_{1}, \\ldots \\}\\) and \n\\(\\mathcal{L} = \\{ L, N, L_{1}, N_{1}, \\ldots \\}\\) are subsets of \n\\(M\\) that represent the possible or actual paths of massive \nparticles and light rays in spacetime.  \n\nDifferential Structure. The differential structure \nis not presupposed; rather through the first few axioms a \ndifferential-manifold structure is introduced on the set of events \n\\(M\\) that is sufficient for the localization of events by means \nof local coordinates, such as radar coordinates. Once \\(M\\) is \ngiven a differential-manifold structure through the introduction of \nlocal radar coordinates by means of particles and light rays (such \nthat any two radar coordinates are smoothly related to one another), \none can do calculus on \\(M\\) and one may speak of tangent and \ndirection spaces. \n\nIt is important to emphasize that the members of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\)\nrepresent possible or actual paths of arbitrary massive\nparticles that may have some internal structure such as higher order\ngravitational and electromagnetic multipole moments and that may\ntherefore interact in complicated ways with various physical\nfields. In order to constructively establish the projective structure\nof spacetime, it is necessary to single out a subset of\n\\(\\mathcal{P}\\), namely \\(\\mathcal{P}_{f}\\), the set of possible or\nactual paths of spherically symmetric, electrically neutral particles\n(that is, the world lines of freely falling particles). However, the\nset \\(\\mathcal{P}_{f} \\subset \\mathcal{P}\\), can be properly \ncharacterized only after a coordinate system (differential structure)\nis available. Consequently, one must employ arbitrary \nparticles in the statement of those axioms that lead to the local \ndifferential structure of spacetime.  \n\nSecond-Order Conformal Structure. The Law of \nCausality asserts the existence of a unique first-order \nconformal structure on spacetime (27), that is, a field of \ninfinitesimal light cones. \n\nOnly null one-directions are determined. Therefore no special choice \nof parameters along light rays is determined by this structure. The \nfirst-order conformal structure can be measured using only the local \ndifferential-topological structure. Moreover, by a purely \nmathematical process involving only differentiation, the first-order \nconformal structure determines a second-order conformal structure, \nnamely, an equivalence class \\(K\\) of conformally related \nsymmetric linear connections.  \n\nProjective Structure. The motions of freely falling \nparticles governed by the guiding field reveal the geodesics of \nspacetime, that is, the geodesics corresponding to an equivalence \nclass \\(\\Pi\\) of projectively equivalent symmetric linear connections. \nOnly geodesic one-directions are determined, that is, no special \nchoice of parameters is involved in characterizing free fall motion. \n\nCompatibility between the Conformal and Projective \nStructures. That the conformal and projective structures are\ncompatible is suggested by high energy experiments, according to \nEhlers, Pirani and Schild: “A massive particle \\((m \\gt 0)\\), \nthough always slower than a photon, can be made to chase a photon \narbitrarily closely.” Ehlers, Pirani and Schild \ntherefore assume an axiom of compatibility between the conformal and \nprojective structures, and this leads to a Weyl space: If \nthe projective and conformal structures are compatible, then the \nintersection \n\nof the equivalence class \\(K\\) of conformally equivalent symmetric\nlinear connections, and the equivalence class \\(\\Pi\\) of projectively \nequivalent symmetric linear connections, contains a unique symmetric \nlinear connection, a Weyl connection. Thus light propagation\nand free (fall) motion reveal on spacetime a unique Weyl connection \nwhich determines the parallel transport of vectors, preserving their \ntimelike, null or spacelike character, and for any pair of non-null \nvectors, the Weyl connection leaves invariant the ratio of their \nlengths and the angle between them, provided the vectors are \ntransported along the same path.  \n\nPseudo-Riemannian Metric. Since length transfer is \nnon-integrable (i.e., path-dependent) in a Weyl space, a Weyl \ngeometry reduces to a pseudo-Riemannian geometry if and only if \nWeyl’s length-curvature \n(Streckenkrümmung) tensor equals \nzero, in which case the length of a vector is path-independent under \nparallel transport, and there exists no second clock effect. \n\nCan it be argued that Ehlers, Pirani and Schild’s generalization of \nWeyl’s causal-inertial method for determining the spacetime metric \nconstitutes a convention-free, and – in relevant respects \n– theory-independent body of evidence that can adjudicate \nbetween spacetime geometries, and hence between spacetime theories \nthat postulate them? As Weyl showed, we can empirically determine the\nmetric field, provided certain epistemic conditions are satisfied, \nthat is, provided we can measure the conformal-causal structure, and \nprovided “we are able to recognize and observe as such the \nmotion of free mass points which follow the guiding field.” \nCriticisms of Ehlers, Pirani and Schild’s constructive axiomatics \nsuggest that the causal-inertial method is not convention-free and \nthat it is ineffective epistemologically in providing a possible \nsolution to the controversy between geometrical realism and \nconventionalism in favor of realism. Basically, all of the charges \nlaid against Ehlers, Pirani and Schild’s constructive axiomatics \nconcentrate on the roles which massive particles play in their \nconstruction. One of the constructive axioms employed by Ehlers, \nPirani and Schild, the projective axiom, is a statement of the \ninfinitesimal version of the Law of Inertia, the law of free (fall) \nmotion which contains Newton’s first law of motion as a special case \nin the absence of gravitation. Since Ehlers, Pirani and Schild do not\nprovide an independent, non-circular criterion by which to \ncharacterize free (fall) motion, their approach has been charged with\ncircularity by philosophers such as Grünbaum (1973), Salmon \n(1977), Sklar (1977) and Winnie (1977).  \n\nThe problem is a familiar one; how to introduce a class of preferred\nmotions, that is, how to characterize that particular path structure\nthat would govern the motions of free particles \\(\\mathcal{P}_{f}\\),\nthat is, neutral, spherically symmetric, non-rotating test bodies,\nwhile avoiding the circularity problem surrounding the notion of\na free particle: The only way of knowing when no forces act\non a body is by observing that it moves as a free particle along the\ngeodesics of spacetime. But how, without already knowing the geodesics\nor the projective structure of spacetime is it possible to determine\nwhich particles are free and which are not? And to determine the\nprojective structure of spacetime it is necessary to use free\nparticles.  \n\nColeman and Korté (1980) have addressed these and related \ndifficulties by providing a non-conventional procedure for the \nempirical determination of the projective \n structure.[64] \n\nIt is worth emphasizing that Weyl’s approach to differential \ngeometry, in which the affine, projective and conformal structures \nare treated in their own right rather than as mere aspects of the \nmetric, was instrumental for his discovery of the non-circular and \nnon-conventional geodesic method for the empirical determination of \nthe spacetimet metric. The old notion of a ‘geodesic \npath’ had its inception in the context of classical \nmetrical geometry and ‘geodesicity’ was \ncharacterized in terms of extremal paths of curves, which \npresupposed a metric. It was Weyl’s metric-independent construction \nof the symmetric linear connection that led him to introduce the \ngeometry of paths and the metric-independent characterization of a \ngeodesic path in terms of the process of autoparallelism of \nits tangent direction.  \n\nWeyl provided a general conceptual/mathematical clarification of the \nconcept of motion that applies to any spacetime theory that is based \non a differential manifold. In particular, Weyl’s penetrating \nanalysis shows that Einstein’s understanding of the role and \nsignificance of Mach’s Principle for the general theory of relativity\nand cosmology is actually inconsistent with the basic principles of \ngeneral relativity.  \n\nWeyl’s major contribution to cosmology is known as “Weyl’s \nHypothesis”. The name was coined by Weyl (1926d) himself in an \narticle in the Encyclopedia of \n Britannica.[65]\n According to Weyl’s Postulate, the worldlines of all galaxies are \nnon-intersecting diverging geodesics that have a common origin in the\ndistant past. From this system of worldlines Weyl derived a common \ncosmic time. On the basis of his postulate, Weyl (1923c, Appendix \nIII) was also the first to show that there is an approximately \nlinear relation between the redshift of galactic spectra and\ndistance. Weyl had basically discovered Hubble’s Law six \nyears prior to Hubble’s formulation of it in 1929. Another \ncontribution to cosmology is Weyl’s (1919b) spherically symmetric \nstatic exact solution to Einstein’s \n linearized[66]\n field equations.  \n\nThere are essentially two ways to understand Mach’s Principle: (1) \nMach’s Principle rejects the absolute character of the inertial \nstructure of spacetime, and (2) Mach’s Principle rejects the inertial\nstructure of spacetime per se. Version (2) might be \ncharacterized as Leibnizian relativity or body \nrelationalism; that is, one understands by relative motion the \nmotion of bodies with respect only to other observable \nbodies or observable bodily reference frames. The \nrelative motion of a body with respect to absolute space or to the \ninertial structure of space (Newton) or spacetime is ruled out on \nepistemological and/or metaphysical grounds.  \n\nIn the context of his general theory of relativity, what Einstein is\nobjecting to in Newtonian Mechanics, and by implication, the theory of\nspecial relativity, is the absolute character of the inertial\nstructure; he is not asserting its fictitious character. That\nis, the general theory of relativity incorporates Mach’s\nPrinciple as expressed in version (1) by treating the inertial\nstructure as dynamical and not as absolute.  \n\nHowever, Einstein also tried to extend and generalize the special\ntheory of relativity by incorporating version (2) of Mach’s\nPrinciple into the general theory of relativity. Einstein was deeply\ninfluenced by Mach’s empiricist programme and accepted\nMach’s insistence on the primacy of observable facts of\nexperience: only observable facts of experience may be invoked to\naccount for the phenomena of motion. As a consequence, Einstein\nrestricted the concept of relative motions to relative motions between\nbodies. Newton thought that the plane of Foucault’s pendulum\nremains aligned with respect to absolute space. Since the fixed stars\nare at rest with respect to absolute space the plane of\nFoucault’s pendulum remains aligned to them as well, and rotates\nrelative to the earth. But according to Einstein, Newton’s\nintermediary notion of absolute space is as questionable as it is\nunnecessary in explaining the behaviour of Foucault’s\npendulum. Not absolute space, but the actually existing masses of the\nfixed stars of the whole cosmos guide the plane of Foucault’s\npendulum.  \n\nEinstein (1916) argued that the general theory of relativity removes \nfrom the special theory of relativity and Newton’s theory an inherent\nepistemological defect. The latter is brought to light by Mach’s \nparadox, namely, Einstein’s example of two fluid bodies, \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\), which are in constant relative rotation about a \ncommon axis. With regard to the extent to which each of the spheres \nbulges at its equator, infinitely many different states are possible \nalthough the relative rotation of the two bodies is the same in every\ncase. Einstein considered the case in which \\(A\\) is a sphere and \n\\(B\\) is an oblate spheroid. The paradox consists in the fact that\nthere is no readily discernible reason that accounts for the fact \nthat one of the bodies bulges and the other does not. According to \nEinstein, an epistemological satisfactory solution to this paradox \nmust be based on ‘an observable fact of experience’. \nEinstein wanted to implement a Leibnizian-Machian relational \nconception of motion according to which all motion is to be \ninterpreted as the motion of some bodies in relation to other bodies.\nEinstein wished to extend the body-relative concept of uniform \ninertial motion to the concept of a body-relative accelerated motion.\n \n\nWeyl was very critical of Einstein’s attempt to incorporate version \n(2) of Mach’s Principle into the theory of general relativity and \nrelativistic cosmology because he considered the Leibnizian-Machian \nrelational conception of motion—according to which all\nmotion is to be interpreted as the motion of some bodies in relation \nto other bodies—to be an incoherent notion within the context \nof the general theory of relativity.  \n\nIn a paper entitled Massenträgheit und \nKosmos. Ein Dialog [Inertial Mass and Cosmos. A \nDialogue] Weyl (1924b) articulates his overall position on the \nconcept of motion and the role of Mach’s Principle in general \nrelativity and \n cosmology.[67]\n Weyl defines Mach’s Principle as follows:  \nM (Mach’s Principle):\nThe inertia of a body is determined through the interaction of all the masses in the universe.\n \n\nWeyl (1924b) then makes the observation that the kinematic \nprinciple of relative motion is by itself without any content, \nunless one also makes the additional physical causal assumption that  \nC (Physical Causality):\nAll events or processes are uniquely causally determined through matter, that is, through charge, mass and the state of motion of the elementary particles of \n matter.[68] \n\nThe underlying motivation for assumption \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) of physical\ncausality is essentially Mach’s empiricist programme, namely,\nMach’s insistence on the primacy of observable facts of\nexperience. Addressing Einstein’s formulation of\nMach’s paradox, Weyl (1924b) says: Only if we conjoin\nthe kinematic principle of relative motion with the physical\nassumption \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) does it appear groundless or impossible on\nthe basis of the kinematic principle that in the absence of any\nexternal forces a stationary body of fluid has the form of a sphere\n“at rest”, while on the other hand it has the form of a\n“rotating” flattened ellipsoid. Weyl rejects principle\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) of physical causality because he denies the feasibility\nof \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) (Mach’s Principle), as defined above, on \\(a\\)\n priori[69]\n grounds. According to Weyl (1924b)  \nA:\nThe concept of relative motion of several isolated bodies with respect\nto each other is as untenable according to the theory of general\nrelativity as is the concept of absolute motion of a single body.\n \n\nWeyl notes that what we seem to observe as the rotation of the stars,\nis in reality not the rotation of the stars themselves but the \nrotation of the “star compass” [Sternenkompass] which \nconsists of light signals from the stars that meet our eyes at our \npresent location from a certain direction. It is crucial, Weyl \nreminds us, to be cognisant of the existence of the metric field \nbetween the stars and our eyes. This metric field determines the \npropagation of light, and, like the electromagnetic field, it is \ncapable of change and variation. Weyl (1924b) says that “the \nmetric field is no less important for the direction in which I see \nthe star then is the location of the star itself.” How is it \npossible, Weyl asks, to compare within the context of the general \ntheory of relativity, the state of motions of two separate bodies? Of\ncourse, Weyl notes, prior to the general theory of relativity, during\nMach’s time, one could rely on a rigid frame of reference such as the\nearth, and indefinitely extend such a frame throughout space. One \ncould then postulate the relative motion of the stars with respect to\nthis frame. However, under the hands of Einstein the coordinate \nsystem has lost its rigidity to such a degree, that it can always \n“cling to the motion of all bodies simultaneously”; that \nis, whatever the motions of the bodies are, there exists a coordinate\nsystem such that all bodies are at rest with respect to that \ncoordinate system. Weyl then clarifies and illustrates the above with\nthe plasticine example, which Weyl (1949a, 105) elsewhere describes \nas follows:  \n\nIncidentally, without a world structure the concept of relative \nmotion of several bodies has, as the postulate of general relativity \nshows, no more foundation than the concept of absolute motion of a \nsingle body. Let us imagine the four-dimensional world as a mass of \nplasticine traversed by individual fibers, the world lines of the \nmaterial particles. Except for the condition that no two world lines \nintersect, their pattern may be arbitrarily given. The plasticine can\nthen be continuously deformed so that not only one but all fibers \nbecome vertical straight lines. Thus no solution of the problem is \npossible as long as in adherence to the tendencies of Huyghens and \nMach one disregards the structure of the world. But once the inertial\nstructure of the world is accepted as the cause for the dynamical \ninequivalence of motions, we recognize clearly why the situation \nappeared so unsatisfactory. … Hence the solution is attained \nas soon as we dare to acknowledge the inertial structure as a \nreal thing that not only exerts effects upon matter but in \nturn suffers such effects. Figure 8:\nWeyl’s plasticine example \n\nApplying these considerations to the fixed stars and assuming that it\nis possible that the (conformal) metrical field which determines the \ncones of light propagation (light cones) at each point of the \nplasticine, is carried along by the continuous transformation of the \nplasticine, then both the earth and the fixed stars will be at rest \nwith respect to the plasticine’s coordinate system. Yet despite this \nthe “star compass” is rotating with respect to the earth,\nexactly as we observe!  \n\nEmploying the concept of the microsymmetry group (definition 4.1), \nColeman and Korté (1982) have analyzed Weyl’s plasticine \nexample in the following way: Consider a space-time manifold equipped\nonly with a differentiable structure, the plasticine of Weyl’s \nexample. Then our spacetime does not have an affine, conformal, \nprojective or metric structure defined on it. In such a world it is \npossible do define curves and paths; however, there are no preferred \ncurves or paths. Since there is only the differentiable structure, \none may apply any diffeomorphism; that is, all \ndiffeomorphisms preserve this structure; consequently, in the \nabsence of a post-differential-topological structure, the \nmicrosymmetry group at any event \\(p\\) is an infinite-parameter \ngroup isomorphic to the group of all invertible formal power series \nin four variables. If there is no post-differentiable topological \ngeometric field in the neighbourhood of a point, then all of these \ninfinite parameters may be chosen freely within rather broad limits. \nClearly then, given an infinite number of parameters, one can, as \nWeyl says, straighten out an arbitrary pattern of world lines \n(fibers) in the neighbourhood of any event. Now suppose that there \nexists a post-differentiable topological geometric field, namely, the\nprojective structure at any event of spacetime. Then the \nmicrosymmetry group that preserves that structure is a 20-parameter \nLie group (see Coleman and Korté (1981)). Thus instead of an \ninfinity of degrees of freedom, only twenty degrees of freedom may be\nused to actively deform the neighbouring region of spacetime. The \nfact that only a finite number of parameter are available prevents an\narbitrary realignment of the worldlines of material bodies in the \nneighbourhood of any given event.  \n\nOther post-differential topological geometrical field structures are \nsimilarly restrictive. For example, the microsymmetry group of the \nconformal structure, which determines the causal structure of \nspacetime, permits 7 degrees of freedom (6 Lorentz transformations \nand a dilatation), and permits four more degrees of freedom in second \norder. Consequently, the existence of the conformal metrical field \nwhich determines at each point the cones of light propagation would \nprevent an arbitrary realignment of light-like fibers, that is, it \nwould be impossible to realign the earth and the fixed stars such \nthat both are at rest with the coordinate system of the plasticine.  \n\nWeyl’s plasticine example shows that the Leibnizian-Machian view of \nrelative motion, namely the view according to which all motion must \nbe defined as motion relative to bodies, is self-defeating in the \ngeneral theory of relativity. The fact that a stationary, homogeneous\nelastic sphere will, when set in rotation, bulge at the equator and \nflatten at the poles is, according to Weyl (1924b), to be accounted \nfor in the following way. The complete physical system consisting of \nboth the body and the local inertial-gravitational field is not the \nsame in the two situations. The cause of the effect is the state of \nmotion of the body with respect to the local \ninertial-gravitational field, the guiding field, and is not, indeed \nas Weyl’s plasticine example shows, cannot be the state of motion of \nthe body relative to other bodies. To attribute the effect as \nEinstein and Mach did to the rotation of the body with respect to the\nother bodies in the universe is, according to Weyl, to \nendorse a remnant of the unjustified monopoly of the older body \nontology, namely, the sovereign right of material bodies to play the \nrole of physically real and acceptable causal \n agents.[70] \n\nWeyl’s view that there must be an inertial structure field \non spacetime, which governs material bodies in free \nmotion, follows from the mathematical nature of the \ncoordinate-transformation laws for acceleration. In a world equipped \nwith only a differential structure, it is possible to do calculus; \none can define curves and paths and differentiate, etc. However, as \nwas already pointed out, in such a world, the world of Weyl’s \nplasticine example, there would be no preferred curves or paths. \nConsequently, the motion of material bodies would not be\npredictable. However, experience overwhelmingly indicates that \nthe acceleration of a massive body cannot be freely chosen. In \nparticular, consider a simple type of particle, a monopole \n(unstructured) particle. Experience overwhelmingly tells us that such\na particle is characterized by the fact that at any event on its \nworld line, its velocity at that event is sufficient to determine its\nacceleration at that event. Predictability of motion, therefore, \nentails that corresponding to every type of massive monopole, there \nexists a geometric structure field, or what Weyl calls a \nStrukturfeld that governs the motion of that type of \nparticle. The basic reason which explains this brute fact of \nexperience is a simple mathematical fact about how the acceleration \nof bodies transforms under a coordinate transformation. Moreover, \nthis simple mathematical fact, involving no more than the basic \ntechniques of partial differentiation, holds in all relativistic, \nnon-relativistic, curved or flat, dynamic or non-dynamic spacetime \ntheories that are based on a local differential topological \nstructure, the minimal structure required for the possibility of \nassigning arbitrary local coordinates on a differential manifold.  \nTransformation law for acceleration:\nThe transformation law for acceleration is linear, but is not\nhomogeneous in the acceleration variable. \n\nAs an example consider the transformation laws for the 4-velocity and\nthe 4-acceleration. Recall that a curve in the\nfour-dimensional spacetime manifold \\(M\\) is a map \\(\\gamma :\n\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow M\\). For convenience we restrict our attention\nto those curves which satisfy \\(\\gamma(0) = p\\). If we set\n\\(\\gamma^{i} = x^{i} \\circ \\gamma(0)\\), then the components of the\n4-velocity and 4-acceleration at \\(p \\in M\\) are respectively given\nby  \n\nThe transformation laws of the 4-velocity components\n\\(\\gamma^{i}_{1}\\) and of the 4-acceleration components\n\\(\\gamma^{i}_{2}\\) under a change of coordinate chart from\n\\((U,x)_{p}\\) to \\((\\overline{U}, \\overline{x})_p\\), follow from their\npointwise definition. From  \n\nwhere \\(\\overline{X}^{i} = \\overline{x}^i \\circ x^{- 1}\\), \none obtains the transformation law for the 4-velocity and the\n4-acceleration respectively:  \n\nThe \\(\\overline{X}^{i}_{j}\\) and \\(\\overline{X}^{i}_{jk}\\) denote the\nfirst and second partial derivatives of \\(\\overline{X}^{i}(x^{i})\\) at\n\\(x^{i} (p)\\), namely, \n\nThe expression \\(\\overline{X}^{i}_{jk}\\gamma^{\\,j}_{1}\\gamma^{k}_{1}\\) in \nequation (33) represents the inhomogeneous term of the transformation\nof the 4-acceleration. The inhomogeneity of the transformation law \nentails that a 4-acceleration that is zero with respect to one \ncoordinate system is not zero with respect to another coordinate \nsystem. This means that there does not exist a unique standard of \nzero 4-acceleration that is intrinsic to the differential topological\nstructure of spacetime. Moreover, even the difference of the \n4-accelerations of two bodies at the same spacetime point has no \nabsolute meaning, unless their 4-velocities happen to be the same. \nThis shows that while the differential topological structure of \nspacetime gives us sufficient structure to do calculus and to derive \nthe transformation laws for 4-velocities and 4-accelerations by way \nof simple differentiation, it does not provide sufficient structure \nwith which to determine a standard of zero 4-acceleration. Therefore,\nas Weyl repeatedly emphasized, no solution to the problem of motion \nis possible, unless “we dare to acknowledge the \ninertial structure as a real thing that not only exerts \neffects upon matter but in turn suffers such effects”. In \nother words there must exist a structure in addition to the \ndifferential topological structure in the form of a geometric \nstructure field, or in Weyl’s words, geometrisches \nStrukturfeld, which constitutes the inertial structure of \nspacetime, and which provides the standard of zero 4-acceleration. \nSince this field provides the standard of zero 4-acceleration we can \ncall it a geodesic 4-acceleration field, or simply, geodesic \nacceleration field. A particle in free motion is one that is\nexclusively governed by this geodesic acceleration field.  \n\nAn acceleration field, geodesic or non-geodesic, can be constructed \nin the following way. Since the terms that are independent of the \n4-acceleration depend on both the spacetime location and on the \ncorresponding 4-velocity of the particle, it is necessary to specify \na geometric field standard for zero 4-acceleration that also\ndepends on those independent variables.  \n\nThe transformation law for a 4-acceleration field can be obtained \nfrom (33) by replacing \n\\(\\overline{\\gamma}^{i}_{2}\\) by \n\\(\\overline{A}^{i}_{2}(\\overline{x}^{i},\\overline{\\gamma}^{i}_{1})\\)\nand \\(\\gamma^{j}_{2}\\) by \\(A^{j}_{2}(x^{i}, \\gamma^{i}_{1}\\)) to yield \n\nThe important special case for which the function \\(A^{i}_{2}(x^{i}, \n\\gamma^{i}_{1})\\) is a geodesic 4-acceleration field \ncorresponds to the affine structure of spacetime. For this special \ncase the function \\(A^{i}_{2}(x^{i}, \\gamma^{i}_{1}\\)) \nis denoted by \\(\\Gamma^{i}_{2}(x^{i}, \\gamma^{i}_{1}\\)) and is given\nby  \n\nThe familiar transformation law for the affine structure (geodesic \n4-acceleration field) is then given by  \n\nNote that the inhomogeneous term \n\\(\\overline{X}^{i}_{jk}\\gamma^{j}_{1}\\gamma^{k}_{1}\\) of the \ngeodesic 4-acceleration field is identical to the inhomogeneous term \nof the transformation law (33) for the 4-acceleration of body motion.\nThe differences  \n\nthen transform linearly and homogeneously; consequently, the \nvanishing or non-vanishing of body accelerations relative to the \nstandard of zero acceleration provided by the geodesic 4-acceleration\nfield (the affine structure), is coordinate independent. That is, the\n4-accelerations of bodies and the corresponding 4-forces, are \ntensorial quantities in concordance with experience.  \n\nThe above argument for the necessity of geometric fields also holds\nfor 3-velocity and 3-acceleration, denoted respectively by\n\\(\\xi^{\\alpha}_{1}\\) and \\(\\xi^{\\alpha}_{2}\\).  The transformation law\nfor the 3-acceleration is much more complicated than that of the\n4-acceleration. However, analogous to the case of 4-acceleration, the\ntransformation law of 3-acceleration is linear and is inhomogeneous in\nthe 3-acceleration variable \\(\\xi^{\\alpha}_{2}\\).  Consequently, there\ndoes not exist a unique standard of zero 3-acceleration that is\nintrinsic to the differential topological structure of spacetime. The\nstandard of zero 3-acceleration must be provided by a geodesic\n3-acceleration field or geodesic directing field, or what Weyl calls\nthe guiding field. The guiding field is also referred to as the\nprojective structure of spacetime and is denoted by\n\\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}_{2}(x^{i}, \\xi^{\\alpha}_{1}\\)). It is a function of\nspacetime location and the 3-velocity, both variables of which are\nindependent of the 3-acceleration, as is required. Since the\ntransformation law of the projective structure\n\\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}_{2}(x^{i}, \\xi^{\\alpha}_{1}\\)) has the same\ninhomogeneous form as the 3-acceleration \\(\\xi^{\\alpha}_{2}\\), the\ndifference  \n\nalso transforms linearly and homogeneously.  \n\nThe components \\(\\gamma^{i}_{2}\\) and \\(\\xi^{\\alpha}_{2}\\) of the \n4-acceleration and 3-acceleration can be thought of as the dynamic \ndescriptors of a material body. On the other hand, the components \n\\(\\Gamma^{i}_{2}(x^{i},\\gamma^{i}_{1}\\)) and \n\\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}_{2}(x^{i}, \\xi^{\\alpha}_{1}\\)) of the \ngeodesic acceleration field, and the geodesic directing field, \nrespectively, are field quantities. The differences  \n\nand  \n\ndenote the components of a coordinate independent field-body\n\n relation.[71] \n\nWeyl (1924b) remarks:  \n\nWe have known since Galileo and Newton, that the motion of a body \ninvolves an inherent struggle between inertia and force. According to\nthe old view, the inertial tendency of persistence, the \n“guidance”, which gives a body its natural inertial \nmotion, is based on a formal geometric structure of the spacetime \n(uniform motion in a straight line) which resides once and for all in\nspacetime independently of any natural processes. This assumption \nEinstein rejects; because whatever exerts as powerful effects as \ninertia—for example, in opposition to the molecular forces of \ntwo colliding trains it rips apart their freight cars—must be \nsomething real which itself suffers effect from matter. Moreover, \nEinstein recognized that the guiding field’s variability and \ndependence on matter is revealed in gravitational effects. Therefore,\nthe dualism between guidance and force is maintained; but  \n\n(G) Guidance is a physical field, like the \nelectromagnetic field, which stands in mutual interaction \nwith matter. Gravitation belongs to the guiding field and not to \nforce. Only thus is it possible to explain the equivalence \nbetween inertial and gravitational mass. \n\nTo move from the old conception to the new conception (G) means, \naccording to Weyl (1924b)  \n\nto replace the geometric difference between uniform and \naccelerated motion with the dynamic difference between \nguidance and force. Opponents of Einstein asked the question: \nSince the church tower receives a jolt in its motion relative to the \ntrain just as the train receives a jolt in its motion relative to the\nchurch tower, why does the train become a wreckage and not the church\ntower which it passes? Common sense would answer: because the train \nis ripped out of the pathway of the guiding field, but the church \ntower is not. … As long as one ignores the guiding field one \ncan neither speak of absolute nor of relative motion; only if one \ngives due consideration to the guiding field does the concept of \nmotion acquire content. The theory of relativity, correctly \nunderstood, does not eliminate absolute motion in favour of relative \nmotion, rather it eliminates the kinematic concept of motion and \nreplaces it with a dynamic one. The worldview for which Galileo \nfought is not undermined by it [relativity]; to the contrary, it is \nmore concretely interpreted. \n\nIt is now possible to provide a reformulation of Newton’s laws of \nmotion which explicitly takes account of Weyl’s \nfield-body-relationalist spacetime ontology, and his analysis of the \nconcept of motion. The law of inertia is an empirically verifiable \n statement[72]\n which says  \n\nThe Law of Inertia: There exists on spacetime a \nunique projective structure \\(\\Pi_{2}\\) or equivalently, a \nunique geodesic directing field \\(\\Pi_{2}\\). \n\nFree motion is defined with reference to the projective \nstructure \\(\\Pi_{2}\\) as follows:  \n\nDefinition of Free Motion: A possible or actual \nmaterial body is in a state of free motion during any part of its \nhistory just in case its motion is exclusively governed by the \ngeodesic directing field (projective structure), that is, just in \ncase the corresponding segment of its world path is a solution path \nof the differential equation determined by the unique projective \nstructure of spacetime. \n\nNewton’s second law of motion may be reformulated as follows:  \n\nThe Law of Motion: With respect to any coordinate \nsystem, the world line path of a possible or actual material body \nsatisfies an equation of the form  \n\nwhere \\(m\\) is a scalar constant characteristic of the material \nbody called its inertial mass, and \n\\(F^{\\alpha}(x^{i},\\xi^{\\alpha}_{1}\\)) is the \n3-force acting on the body. \n\nTo emphasize, the Law of Inertia and the Law of Motion, as formulated\nabove, apply to all, relativistic or non-relativistic, \ncurved or flat, dynamic or non-dynamic, spacetime theories. The \nreason for the general character of these laws consists in the fact \nthat they require for their formulation only the local differential \ntopological structure of spacetime, a structure which is common to \nall spacetime theories. In addition, as was noted earlier in \n§4.2, the affine and projective spacetime structures are \nG-structures. Consequently, they may be flat or non-flat; but \nthey can never vanish. In theories prior to the advent of \ngeneral relativity, the affine and projective structures were flat. \nIt was common practice, however, to use coordinate systems that were\nadapted to these flat G-structures. And since in such \nadapted coordinate systems the components of the affine and \nprojective structures vanish, it was difficult to recognize and to \nappreciate the existence of these structures, and their important role\nin providing a coherent account of motion.  \n\nWe saw that Weyl forcefully advocated a field-body ontological \ndualism, according to which matter and the guiding field are \nindependent physical realities that causally interact with each \nother: matter uniquely generates the various states of the guiding \nfield, and the guiding field in turn acts on matter.  \n\nWeyl did not always subscribe to this ontological dualist position. \nFor a short period, from 1918 to 1920, he advocated a pure field \ntheory of matter , developed in 1912 by Gustav Mie, in the context\nof Einstein’s special theory of relativity:  \nPure Field Theory of Matter:\nThe physical field has an independent reality that is not reducible to\nmatter; rather, the physical field is constitutive of all matter in\nthe sense that the mass (quantity of matter) of a material particle,\nsuch as an electron, consists of a large field energy that is\nconcentrated in a very small region of spacetime. \n\nMie’s theory of matter is akin to the traditional geometric\nview of matter: matter is passive and pure \nextension. Weyl (1921b) remarks that he adopted the \nstandpoint of the classical pure field theory of matter in the first \nthree editions of Weyl (1923b) because of its beauty and unity, but \nthen gave it up. Weyl (1931a) points out in the Rouse Ball Lecture \nthat since the theory of general relativity geometrized a physical \nentity, the gravitational field, it was natural to try to \ngeometrize the whole of physics. Prior to the advent of \nquantum physics one was justified in regarding gravitation and \nelectromagnetism as the only basic entities of nature and to seek \ntheir unification by geometrizing both. One could hope, following the\nexample of Gustav Mie, to construct elementary material particles as \nknots of energy in the gravitational-electromagnetic field, \nthat is, tiny demarcated regions in which the field magnitudes attain\nvery high values.  \n\nAlready in a letter to Felix \n Klein,[73]\n toward the end of 1920, Weyl indicated that he had finally freed \nhimself completely from Mie’s theory of matter. It now appeared to \nhim that the classical field theory of matter is not the key to \nreality. In the Rouse Ball Lecture Weyl adduces two reasons for this.\n \n\nFirst, due to quantum mechanics, there are, in addition to \nelectromagnetic waves, matter waves (Materiewellen)\nrepresented by Schrödinger’s wave function \\(\\psi\\). And Pauli and \nDirac recognized that \\(\\psi\\) is not a scalar but a magnitude with \nseveral components. Thus, from the point of view of the classical \nfield theory of matter not two but three entities would have to be \nunified. Moreover, given the transformation properties of the wave \nfunction, Weyl says it is certain that the magnitude \\(\\psi\\) cannot be \nreduced to gravitation or electromagnetism. Weyl saw clearly, that \nthis geometric view of matter or physics—which to a \ncertain extent had also motivated his earlier construction and manner\nof presentation of a pure infinitesimal geometry—was\nuntenable in light of the new developments in atomic physics.  \n\nThe second reason, Weyl says, consists in the radical new \ninterpretation of the wave function, which replaces the concept of \nintensity with that of probability. It is only through such a \nstatistical interpretation that the corpuscular and atomistic aspect \nof nature is properly recognized. Instead of a geometric \ntreatment of the classical field theory of matter, the new \nquantum theory called for a statistical treatment of \n matter.[74]\n Already in 1920, Weyl (1920) addressed the relationship between \ncausal and statistical approaches to \n physics.[75] \n\nThe theory of general relativity, as well as early developments in \natomic physics, clearly tell us, Weyl (1921b) suggests, that matter \nuniquely determines the field, and that there exist deeper underlying\nphysical laws with which modern physics, such as quantum theory, is \nconcerned, which specify “how the field is affected by \nmatter”. That is, experience tells us that matter plays the \nrole of a causal agent which uniquely determines the field, \nand which therefore has an independent physical reality that cannot \nbe reduced to the field on which it acts. Weyl (1921b, 1924e) refers \nto his theory of matter as the Agenstheorie der Materie \n(literally, agent-theory of matter):  \nMatter-Field Dualism (Weyl’s Agens Theory of Matter):\nMatter and field are independent physical realities that causally\ninteract with each other: matter uniquely generates the various states\nof the field, and the field in turn acts on matter. To excite the field\nis the essential primary function of matter. The field’s function is\nto respond to the action of matter and is thus secondary. The\nsecondary role of the field is to transmit effects (from body to body)\ncaused by matter, thereby in return affecting matter. \n\nThe view, that matter uniquely determines the field, \nwas a necessary postulate of an opposing \nontological standpoint, according to Weyl. The postulate essentially says that Matter is the only thing which is \ngenuinely real. According to this ontological view, held to a certain degree\nby the younger Einstein and others who advocated a form of Machian \nempiricism, the field is relegated to play the role of a feeble \nextensive medium which transmits effects from body to \n body.[76]\nAccording to this opposing ontological view, the field laws, that is, certain implicit differential \nconnections between the various possible states of the field, on the \nbasis of which the field alone is capable of transmitting effects \ncaused by matter, can essentially have no more significance for \nreality than the laws of geometry could, according to earlier views. \nBut as we saw earlier, Weyl held that no satisfactory solution can be given to \nthe problem of motion as long as we adhere to the Einstein-Machian \nempiricist position that relegates the field to the role of a feeble\nextensive medium, and which does not acknowledge that the guiding \nfield is physically real. However, from the standpoint of Weyl’s agens theory of \nmatter, a satisfactory answer to Mach’s paradox can be given: \nthe reason why a stationary, homogeneous elastic sphere will bulge at the equator and flatten at the poles, when \nset in rotation, is \ndue to the fact that the complete physical system consisting of both \nthe body and the guiding field, differs in the rotating case\nfrom the stationary one. The local guiding field is the real cause of\nthe inertial forces.  \n\nWeyl lists two reasons in support for his agens theory of matter. \nFirst, the agens theory of matter is the only theory which coheres \nwith the basic experiences of life and physics: matter generates the \nfield and all our actions ultimately involve matter. For example, \nonly through matter can we change the field. Secondly, in order to \nunderstand the fact of the existence of charged material particles, \nwe have two possibilities: either we follow Mie and adopt a pure \nfield theory of matter, or we elevate the ontological status of \nmatter and regard it as a real singularity of the field and \nnot merely as a high concentration of field energy in a tiny region \nof spacetime. Since Mie’s approach is necessarily limited to the \nframework of the theory of special relativity, and since there is no \nroom in the general theory of relativity for a generalization and \nmodification of the classical field laws, as envisaged by Mie in the \ncontext of the special theory of relativity, Weyl adopted the second \npossibility. He was motivated to do so by his recognition that the \nfield equation of an electron at rest contains a finite mass term \n\\(m\\) that appears to have nothing to do with the energy of the \nassociated field. Weyl’s subsequent analysis of mass in terms of \nelectromagnetic field energy provided a definition of mass and a \nderivation of the basic equations of mechanics, and led Weyl to the \ninvention of the topological idea of wormholes in spacetime.\nWeyl did not use the term ‘wormholes’; it was John \nWheeler who later coined the term ‘wormhole’ in 1957. \nWeyl spoke of one-dimensional tubes instead. \n“Inside” these tubes no space exists, and their \nboundaries are, analogous to infinite distance, inaccessible; they do\nnot belong to the field. In a chapter entitled “Hermann Weyl \nand the Unity of Knowledge” Wheeler (1994) says,  \n\nAnother insight Weyl gave us on the nature of electricity is \ntopological in character and dates from 1924. We still do not know \nhow to assess it properly or how to fit it into the scheme of \nphysics, although with each passing decade it receives more \nattention. The idea is simple. Wormholes thread through space as air \nchannels through Swiss cheese. Electricity is not electricity. \nElectricity is electric lines of force trapped in the topology of \nspace. \n\nA year after Einstein (1916) had established the field equations of \nhis new general theory of relativity, Einstein (1917) applied his \ntheory for the first time to cosmology. In doing so, Einstein made \nseveral assumptions:  \nCosmological Principle: Like Newton, Einstein \nassumed that the universe is homogeneous and \nisotropic in its distribution of matter. \nStatic Universe: Einstein assumed, as did \nNewton and most cosmologists at that time, that the universe is \nstatic on the large scale. \nMach’s Principle: Einstein believed that the \nmetric field is completely determined through the masses of bodies. \nThe metric field is determined through the energy-momentum tensor of \nthe field equations. \n\nThe cosmological principle continuous to play an important \nrole in cosmological modelling to this day. However, Einstein’s \nsecond assumption that the universe is static was in conflict with \nhis field equations, which permitted models of the universe that were\nhomogeneous and isotropic, but not static. In this regard, \nEinstein’s difficulties were essentially the same that Newton had \nfaced: A static Newtonian model involving an infinite container with \nan infinite number of stars was unstable; that is, local regions \nwould collapse under gravity. Because Einstein was committed to \nMach’s Principle he faced a problem concerning the boundary \nconditions for infinite space containing finite \namount of \n matter.[77]\n Einstein recognized that it was impossible to choose boundary \nconditions such that the ten potentials of the metric \n\\(g_{ij}\\) are completely determined by the \nenergy-momentum tensor \\(T_{ij}\\), as required by \nMach’s Principle. That is, the boundary conditions “flat at \ninfinity” entail a global inertial frame that\nis tied to empty flat space at infinity, and hence is \nunrelated to the mass-energy content of space, contrary to Mach’s \nPrinciple, according to which only mass-energy can influence\ninertia.  \n\nEinstein thought that he could solve the difficulties of an unstable \nnon-static universe with boundary conditions at infinity that do not \nsatisfy Mach’s Principle, by introducing the cosmological term \n\\(\\Lambda\\) into his field equations. He showed that for positive values\nof the cosmological constant, his modified field equation admitted a \nsolution for a \n static[78]\n universe in which space is curved, unbounded and finite; that is, \nspace is a hyper surface of a sphere in four \ndimensions. Einstein’s spatially closed universe is often \nreferred to as Einstein’s “cylinder” world: with two of \nthe spatial dimensions suppressed, the model universe can be pictured\nas a cylinder where the radius \\(A\\) represents the space and the \naxis the time coordinate.  Figure 9:\nEinstein Universe \n\nAccording to Einstein’s Machian convictions, since inertia is \ndetermined only by matter, there can be no inertial structure or \nfield in the absence of matter. Consequently, it is impossible, \nEinstein conjectured, to find a solution to the field \nequations—that is, to determine the metric \n\\(g_{ij}\\)—if the energy-momentum tensor \n\\(T_{ij}\\) representing the mass-energy content of \nthe universe is zero. The non-existence of ‘vacuum \nsolutions’ for a static universe demonstrated, Einstein \nthought, that Mach’s Principle had been successfully incorporated \ninto his theory of general relativity. Einstein also believed that \nhis solution was unique because of the assumptions of isotropy and \n homogeneity.[79] \n\nHowever, Einstein was mistaken. In 1917, the Dutch astronomer Willem \nde Sitter published another solution to Einstein’s field equations \ncontaining the cosmological constant. De Sitter’s solution showed \nthat Einstein’s solution is not a unique solution of his field \nequations. In addition, since de Sitter’s universe is empty it \nprovided a direct counter-example to Einstein’s hope that Mach’s \nPrinciple had been successfully incorporated into his \n theory.[80] \n\nThere are cosmologists who, like Einstein, are favourably disposed \ntowards some version of Mach’s Principle, and who believe that the \nlocal laws, which are satisfied by various physical fields, are \ndetermined by the large scale structure of the universe. On the other\nhand, there are those cosmologists who, like Weyl, take a \nconservative approach; they take empirically confirmed local \nlaws and investigate what these laws might imply about the \nuniverse as a whole. Our understanding of the large scale structure \nof the universe, Weyl emphasized, must be based on theories and \nprinciples which are verified locally. Einstein’s general theory is a\nlocal field theory; like electromagnetism, it is a close\naction \n theory.[81]\n Weyl (1924b) says:  \n\nIt appears to me that one can grasp the concrete physical content of \nthe theory of relativity without taking a position regarding the \ncausal relationship between the masses of the universe and inertia. \n\nAnd, referring to (G), (see citation at the end of §4.4.3), \nwhich says that “Guidance is a physical field, like \nthe electromagnetic field, which stands in mutual \ninteraction with matter. Gravitation belongs to the guiding field \nand not to force”, Weyl (1924b) says:  \n\nWhat I have so far presented and briefly formulated in the two \nsentences of G, that alone impacts on physics and underlies the \nactual individual investigations of problems of the theory of \nrelativity. Mach’s Principle, according to which the fixed stars \nintervene with mysterious power in earthly events, goes far beyond \nthis [G] and is until now pure speculation; it merely has \ncosmological significance and does not become important for natural \nscience until astronomical observations reach the totality of the \ncosmos [Weltganze], and not merely one island of stars \n[Sterneninsel]. We could leave the question unanswered if I did not \nhave to admit that it is tempting to construct, on the basis of the \ntheory of relativity, a picture of the totality of the cosmos. \n\nWeyl’s claim is that because general relativity is an inherently \nlocal field theory, its validity and soundness is \nessentially independent of global cosmological considerations. \nHowever, if we wish to introduce such global considerations into our \nlocal physics, then we can do so only on the basis of additional \nassumptions, such as, for example, the Cosmological Principle, \nalready mentioned. In 1923 Weyl (1923b, §39) introduced another \ncosmological assumption, namely, the so-called Weyl \nPostulate. De Sitter’s solution and the new astronomical \ndiscoveries in the early 1920’s, which suggested that the universe is\nnot static but expanding, led to a drastic change in thinking about \nthe nature of the universe and an increased scepticism towards \nEinstein’s model of a static universe. In 1923, Weyl (1923b, \n§39) notes in the fifth edition of Raum Zeit Materie, \nthat despite its attractiveness, Einstein’s cosmology suffers from \nserious defects. Weyl begins by pointing out that spectroscopic \nresults indicate that the stars have an age. Weyl continued,  \n\nall our experiences about the distribution of stars show that the \npresent state of the starry sky has nothing to do with a \n“statistical final state.” The small velocities \nof the stars is due to a common origin rather than some equilibrium; \nincidentally, it appears, based on observation, that the more distant\nconfigurations are from each other, the greater the velocities on \naverage. Instead of uniform distribution of matter, astronomical \nfacts lead rather to the view that individual clouds of stars glide \nby in vast empty space. \n\nWeyl further points out that de Sitter showed that Einstein’s \ncosmological equations of gravity have “a very simple regular \nsolution” and that an empty spacetime, namely, “a \nmetrically homogeneous spacetime of non-vanishing curvature,” \nis compatible with these equations after all. Weyl says that de \nSitter’s solution, which on the whole is not static, forces us to \nabandon our predilection for a static universe.  \n\nThe Einstein and the de Sitter universe are both spacetimes with two \nseparate fringes, the infinitely remote past and the infinitely \nremote future. Dropping two of its spatial dimensions we imagine \nEinstein’s universe as the surface of a straight cylinder of a \ncertain radius and de Sitter’s universe as a one sheeted hyperboloid.\nBoth surfaces are surfaces of infinite extent in both directions. \nBoth the Einstein universe and the de Sitter universe spread from the\neternal past to the eternal future. However, unlike de Sitter’s \nuniverse, in Einstein’s universe “the metrical relations are \nsuch that the light cone issuing from a world point is folded back \nupon itself an infinite number of times. An observer should therefore\nsee infinitely many images of a star, showing him the star in states \nbetween which an eon has elapsed, the time needed by the light to \ntravel around the sphere of the world.” Weyl (1930) says:  \n\n… I start from de Sitter’s solution: the world, according to \nits metric constitution, has the character of a four-dimensional \n“sphere” (hyperboloid)  \n\nin a five-dimensional quasi-euclidean space, with the line element  \n\nThe sphere has the same degree of metric homogeneity as the world of \nthe special theory of relativity, which can be conceived as a \nfour-dimensional “plane” in the same space. The plane, \nhowever, has only one connected infinitely distant \n“seam,” while it is the most prominent topological \nproperty of the sphere to be endowed with two—the infinitely \ndistant past and the infinitely distant future. In this sense one may\nsay that space is closed in de Sitter’s solution. On the other hand, \nhowever, it is distinguished from the well-known Einstein solution, \nwhich is based on a homogeneous distribution of mass, by the fact \nthat the null cone of future belonging to a world-point does not \noverlap with itself; in this causal sense, the de Sitter space is \nopen. \n\nOn this hyperboloid, a single star (nebula or galaxy, in later \ncontexts) \\(A\\), also called “observer” by Weyl, \ntraces a geodesic world line, and from each point of the star’s world\nline a light cone opens into the future and fills a region \\(D\\), \nwhich Weyl calls the domain of influence of the star. In de \nSitter’s cosmology this domain of influence covers only half of the \nhyperboloid and Weyl suggests that it is reasonable to assume that \nthis half of the hyperboloid corresponds to the real world.  Figure 10:\nDe Sitter’s hyperboloid with domain of influence \\(D\\) \ncovering half of the hyperboloid and world lines of stars. \n\nThere are innumerable stars or geodesics, according to Weyl, that \nhave the same domain of influence as the arbitrarily chosen star \n\\(A\\); they form, he says, a system that has been causally \ninterconnected since eternity. Such a system of causally \ninterconnected stars Weyl describes as stars of a common origin that \nlies in an infinitely remote past. The sheaf of world-lines of such a\nsystem of stars converges, in the direction of the infinitely remote \npast, on an infinitely small part of the total extent of the \nhyperboloid, and diverges in the direction of the future on an ever \nincreasing extent of the hyperboloid. Weyl’s choice of singling out a\nparticular sheaf of non-intersecting timelike geodesics as \nconstituting the cosmological substratum is the content of Weyl’s \nPostulate. Weyl (1923b, 295) says:  \n\nThe hypothesis is suggestive, that all the celestial bodies which we \nknow belong to such a single system; this would explain the small \nvelocities of the stars as a consequence of their common origin. \n\nThe transition from a static to a dynamic universe opens up the \npossibility of a disorderly universe where galaxies could collide, \nthat is, their world lines might intersect. Roughly speaking, Weyl’s \nPostulate states that the actual universe is an orderly universe. It \nsays that the world lines of the galaxies form a 3-sheaf of \n non-intersecting[82]\n geodesics orthogonal to layers of spacelike hypersurfaces. Figure 11:\nWeyl’s Postulate \n\nSince the relative velocities of matter is small in each collection \nof galaxies extending over an astronomical neighbourhood, one can \napproximate a “smeared-out” motion of the galaxies and \nintroduce a substratum or fluid which fills space \nand in which the galaxies move like “fundamental \n particles”.[83]\n Weyl’s postulate says that observers associated with this smeared-out\nmotion constitute a privileged class of observers of the universe. \nSince geodesics do not intersect, according to Weyl’s Postulate, \nthere exist one and only one geodesic which passes through each \nspacetime point. Consequently, matter possesses a unique velocity at \nany spacetime point. Therefore, the fluid may be regarded as a \nperfect fluid; and this is the essential content of Weyl’s \nPostulate.  \n\nSince the geodesics of the galaxies are orthogonal to a layer of\nspacelike hypersrfaces according to Weyl’s Postulate, one can\nintroduce coordinates \\((x^{0}, x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3})\\) such that the\nspacelike hypersurfaces are given by \\(x^{0} =\\) constant, and the\nspacelike coordinates \\(x^{\\alpha}\\) \\((\\alpha = 1, 2, 3)\\) are constant\nalong the geodesics of each galaxy. Therefore, the spacelike\ncoordinates \\(x^{\\alpha}\\) are co-moving coordinates along \nthe geodesics of each galaxy. The \northogonality condition permits a choice of the time coordinate \n\\(x^{0}\\) such that the metric or line element has the \nform  \n\nwhere \\(ct = x^{0}, x^{0}\\) is called the \ncosmic time, and \\(t\\) is the proper time of any\ngalaxy. The spacelike hypsersurfaces are therefore the surfaces of \nsimultaneity with respect to the cosmic time \\(x^{0}\\). \nThe Cosmological Principle in turn tells us that these hypersurfaces \nof simultaneity are homogeneous and isotropic.  \n\nIndependently, Robertson and Walker, were subsequently able to give a\nprecise mathematical derivation of the most general metric by \nassuming Weyl’s Postulate and the Cosmological Principle.  \n\nWeyl’s introduction of his Postulate made it possible for him to\nprovide the first satisfactory treatment of the cosmological\nredshift. Consider a light source, say a star \\(A\\), which emits\nmonochromatic light that travels along null geodesics \\(L, L',\\ldots\\)\nto an observer \\(O\\). Let \\(s\\) be the proper time of the light\nsource, and let \\(\\sigma\\) be the proper time of the observer\n\\(O\\). Then to every point \\(s\\) on the world line of the light source\n\\(A\\) there corresponds a point on the world line of the observer\n\\(O\\), namely, \\(\\sigma = \\sigma(s)\\).  Figure 12:\nA body or star \\(A\\) emits monochromatic light which travels along\nnull geodesics \\(L, L',\\ldots\\) to an observer \\(O\\). \n\nConsequently, if one of the generators of the light cone issuing from\n\\(A\\)’s world line at \\(A\\)’s proper time \n\\(s_{0}\\)—the null geodesic \\(L\\)—reaches \nobserver \\(O\\) at the observer’s proper time \n\\(\\sigma(s_{0})\\), then  \n\nTherefore, the frequency \\(\\nu_{A}\\) of the light that \nwould be measured by some hypothetical observer on \\(A\\) is \nrelated to the frequency \\(\\nu_{O}\\) measured on \\(O\\)\nby  \n\nAccording to Weyl (1923c) this relationship holds in arbitrary \nspacetimes and for arbitrary motions of source and observer. Weyl \n(1923b, Anhang III) then applied this relationship to de Sitter’s \nworld and showed, to lowest order, that the redshift is linear \nin distance; that is, Weyl theoretically derived, what was later\ncalled Hubble’s redshift law. Using Slipher’s \nredshift data Weyl estimated a Hubble constant six years \nprior to Hubble. Weyl (1923b, Anhang III) remarks:  \n\nIt is noteworthy that neither the elementary nor Einstein’s cosmology\nlead to such a redshift. Of course, one cannot claim today, that our \nexplanation hits the right mark, especially since the views about the\nnature and distance of the spiral nebulae are still very much in need\nof further clarification. \n\nIn 1933 Weyl gave a lecture in Göttingen in which Weyl (1934b) \nrecalls  \n\nAccording to the Doppler effect the receding motion of the stars is \nrevealed in a redshift of their spectral lines which is proportional \nto distance. In this form, where De Sitter’s solution of the \ngravitational equation is augmented by an assumption concerning the \nundisturbed motion of the stars, I had predicted the redshift in the \nyear 1923. \n\nDuring the period 1925–1926 Weyl published a sequence of \ngroundbreaking papers (Weyl (1925, 1926a,b,c)) in which he presented \na general theory of the representations and invariants of the \nclassical Lie groups. In these celebrated papers Weyl drew together \nI. Schur’s work on invariants and representations of the \n\\(n\\)-dimensional rotation group, and É. Cartan’s work on \nsemisimple Lie algebras. In doing so, Weyl utilized different fields \nof mathematics such as, tensor algebra, invariant theory, Riemann \nsurfaces and Hilbert’s theory of integral equations. Weyl himself \nconsidered these papers his greatest work in mathematics.  \n\nThe central role that group theoretic techniques played in Weyl’s \nanalysis of spacetime was one of several factors which led Weyl to \nhis general theory of the representations and invariants of the \nclassical Lie groups. It was in the context of Weyl’s investigation \nof the space-problem (see §4.2) that Weyl came to appreciate the\nvalue of group theory for investigating the mathematical and \nphilosophical foundations of physical theories in general, and for \ndealing with fundamental questions motivated by the general theory of\nrelativity, in particular.  \n\nA motivation of quite another sort, which led Weyl to his general \nrepresentation theory, was provided by Study when he attacked Weyl \nspecifically, as well as other unnamed individuals, by accusing them \n“of having neglected a rich cultural domain (namely, the theory\nof invariants), indeed of having completely ignored \n it”.[84]\n Weyl (1924c) replied immediately providing a new foundation for the \ntheory of invariants of the special linear groups \n\n\\(SL(n, \\mathbb{C})\\) and its most important subgroups, the special\northogonal group \\(SO(n, \\mathbb{C})\\) and the special symplectic group\n\\(SSp(\\bfrac{n}{2}, \\mathbb{C})\\) (for \\(n\\) even) based on algebraic\nidentities due to Capelli. In a footnote, Weyl (1924c) sarcastically\ninformed Study that “even if he [Weyl] had been as well versed\nas Study in the theory of invariants, he would not have used the\nsymbolic method in his book\nRaum, Zeit, Materie and even with the last breath of his \nlife would not have mentioned the algebraic completeness theorem for \ninvariant theory”. Weyl’s point was that in the context of his \nbook Raum-Zeit-Materie, the kernel-index method of tensor \nanalysis is more appropriate than the methods of the theory of \nalgebraic \n invariants.[85] \n\nWhile this account of events leading up to Weyl’s groundbreaking \npapers on group theory seems reasonable enough, Hawkins (2000) has \nsuggested a fuller account, which brings into focus Weyl’s deep \nphilosophical interest in the mathematical foundations of the theory \nof general relativity by drawing attention to Weyl (1924d) on tensor \nsymmetries, which, according to Hawkins, played an important role in \nredirecting Weyl’s research interests toward pure \n mathematics.[86]\n Weyl (1949b, 400) himself noted that his interest in the \nphilosophical foundations of the general theory of relativity \nmotivated his analysis of the representations and invariants of the \ncontinuous groups: “I can say that the wish to understand what \nreally is the mathematical substance behind the formal apparatus of \nrelativity theory led me to the study of representations and \ninvariants of groups; and my experience in this regard is probably \nnot unique”. Weyl’s paper (Weyl (1924a)), and the first chapter\nWeyl (1925) of his celebrated papers on representation theory, have \nthe same title: “The group theoretic foundation of the tensor \ncalculus”. Hawkins (1998) says, Weyl  \n\nhad obtained through the theory of groups, and in particular through \nthe theory of group representations—as augmented by his own \ncontributions—what he felt was a proper mathematical \nunderstanding of tensors, tensor symmetries, and the reason they \nrepresent the source of all linear quantities that might arise in \nmathematics or physics. Once again, he had come to appreciate the \nimportance of the theory of groups—and now especially the \ntheory of group representation—for gaining insight into \nmathematical questions suggested by relativity theory. Unlike his \nwork on the space problem …Weyl now found himself drawing upon\nfar more than the rudiments of group theory. … And of course \n Cartan[87]\n had showed that the space problem could also be resolved with the aid\nof results about representations. In short, the representation theory\nof groups had proved itself to be a powerful tool for answering the \nsort of mathematical questions that grew out of Weyl’s involvement \nwith relativity theory. \n\nSomewhat later, Weyl (1939) wrote a book, entitled The Classical \nGroups, Their Invariants and Representations, in which \nhe returned to the theory of invariants and representations of the \nsemisimple Lie groups. In this work, he satisfied his ambition \n“to derive the decisive results for the most important of these\ngroups by direct algebraic construction, in particular for the full \ngroup of all non-singular linear transformations and for the \northogonal group”. He intentionally restricted the discussion \nof the general theory and devoted most of the book to the derivation \nof specific results for the general linear, the special linear, the \northogonal and the symplectic groups.  \n\nAs far back as the 1920s, the great French mathematician and geometer\nÉlie Cartan had recognized that the notions\nof parallelism and affine connection admit of an\nimportant generalization in the sense that (1) the spaces for which\nthe notion of infinitesimal parallel transport is defined need not be\nthe tangent spaces that intrinsically arise from the differential\nstructure of a Riemannian manifold \\(M\\) at each of its points;\nrather, the spaces are general spaces that are not intrinsically tied\nto the differential manifold structure of \\(M\\), and (2) relevant\ngroups operate on these general spaces directly and not on the\nmanifold \\(M\\), and therefore groups play a dominant and independent\nrole.  \n\nWeyl (1938a) published a critical review of Cartan’s (1937) book in \nwhich Cartan further developed his notion of moving frames \n(“repères mobiles”) and generalized \nspaces (“espaces généralisés”).\nHowever, Weyl (1988) expressed some of his reservations to Cartan’s \napproach as early as 1925; and four years later Weyl (1929e) \npresented a more detailed critique.  \n\nCartan’s approach to differential geometry is in response to the fact\nthat Euclidean geometry was generalized in two ways resulting in \nessentially two incompatible approaches to \n geometry.[88]\n The first generalization occurred with the discovery of non-Euclidean\ngeometries and with Klein’s (1921) subsequent Erlanger program in \n1872, which provided a coherent group theoretical framework for the \nvarious non-Euclidean geometries. The second generalization of \nEuclidean geometry occurred when Riemann (1854) discovered Riemannian\ngeometry.  \n\nThe two generalizations of Euclidean geometry essentially constitute \nincompatible approaches to applied geometry. In particular, while \nKlein’s Erlanger program provides an appropriate group theoretical \nframework for Einstein’s theory of special relativity, it is \nRiemannian geometry, and not Klein’s group theoretic approach, which \nprovides the appropriate underlying geometric framework for \nEinstein’s theory of general relativity. As Cartan observes:  \n\nGeneral relativity threw into physics and philosophy the antagonism \nthat existed between the two principle directors of geometry, Riemann\nand Klein. The space-times of classical mechanics and of special \nrelativity are of the type of Klein, those of general relativity are \nof the type of \n Riemann.[89] \n\nCartan eliminated the incompatibility between the two approaches by \nsynthesizing Riemannian geometry and Klein’s Erlanger program through\na further generalization of both, resulting in what Cartan called, \ngeneralized spaces (or generalized geometries).  \n\nIn his Erlanger program, Klein provided a unified approach to the \nvarious “global” geometries by showing that each of the \ngeometries is characterized by a particular group of transformations:\nEuclidean geometry is characterized by the group of translations and \nrotations in the plane; the geometry of the sphere \n\\(S^{2}\\) is characterized by the orthogonal group \n\\(O(3)\\); and the geometry of the hyperbolic plane is \ncharacterized by the pseudo-orthogonal group \\(O(1, 2)\\). In \nKlein’s approach each geometry is a (connected) manifold endowed with\na group of automorphisms, that is, a Lie group \\(G\\) of \n“motions” that acts transitively on the \nmanifold, such that two figures are regarded as congruent if and only\nif there exists an element of the appropriate Lie group \\(G\\) that\ntransforms one of the figures into the other. A generalized geometry \nin Klein’s sense shifts the emphasis from the underlying manifold or \nspace to the group. Thus a Klein geometry (space) consists of, (1) a \nsmooth manifold, (2) a Lie group \\(G\\) (the principal group of the\ngeometry), and (3) a transitive action of \\(G\\) on the manifold. \nBesides being “global”, a Klein geometry (space) is \ncompletely homogeneous in the sense that its points cannot be \ndistinguished on the basis of geometric relations because the \ntransitive group action preserves such relations.  \n\nAs Weyl (1949b) describes it, Klein’s approach to the various \n“global” geometries is very suited to Einstein’s theory \nof special relativity:  \n\nAccording to Einstein’s special relativity theory the \nfour-dimensional world of the spacetime points is a Klein space \ncharacterized by a definite group \\(\\Gamma\\); and that group is the \n… group of Euclidean similarities—with one very \nimportant difference however. The orthogonal transformations, i.e., \nthe homogeneous linear transformations which leave  \n\nunchanged have to be replaced by the Lorentz transformations leaving  \n\ninvariant. \n\nHowever, with the advent of Einstein’s general theory of relativity \nthe emphasis shifted from global homogeneous geometric \nstructures to local inhomogeneous structures. Whereas Klein \nspaces are global and fully homogeneous, the Riemannian metric \nstructure underlying Einstein’s general theory is local and \ninhomogeneous. A general Riemannian space admits of no isometry other\nthan the identity.  \n\nReferring to Cartan (1923a), Weyl (1929e) says that Cartan’s \ngeneralization of Klein geometries consists in adapting Klein’s \nErlanger program to infinitesimal geometry by applying Klein’s \nErlanger program to the tangent plane rather than to the manifold \n itself.[90] \n\nCartan developed a general scheme of infinitesimal geometry in which \nKlein’s notions were applied to the tangent plane and not to the \n\\(n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\) itself. Figure 13:\nCartan’s generalization \n\nFigure 13 above, adapted from Sharpe (1997), may help in clarifying \nthe discussion. The generalization of Euclidean geometry to a \nRiemannian space (the left vertical blue arrow) says:  \n\nAnalogously, Cartan’s generalization of a Klein space to a Cartan \nspace (the right vertical blue arrow) says:  Figure 14:\nCartan’s generalized space \n\nCartan’s generalized space \\(\\Sigma\\)(M) is the space of all \n“Tangent Spaces” (i.e., all Klein spaces\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p}))\\) and contains a mixture of \nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous spaces (see figure 14).  \n\nFinally, Cartan’s generalization of Riemannian space (lower \nhorizontal red arrow) (figure 13) turns on the recognition that the \n“Tangent Space” in Cartan’s sense is not\nthe same, or need not be the same, as the ordinary tangent \nspace that arises naturally from the underlying differential\nstructure of a Riemannian manifold. Cartan’s \n“Tangent Space”\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) at \\(p \\in M\\) denotes what is known as\na fiber in modern fiber bundle language, where the manifold\n\\(M\\) is called the base space of the fiber bundle.  \n\nIn Weyl (1929e, 1988) and to a lesser extent in Weyl (1938a), Weyl\nobjected to Cartan’s approach by noting that Cartan’s\n“Tangent Space”, namely the Klein space\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) associated with each point of the manifold \\(M\\),\ndoes not arise intrinsically from the differential structure of the\nmanifold the way the ordinary tangent vector space does. Weyl\ntherefore noted that it is necessary to impose certain non-intrinsic\nembedding conditions on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) that specify how the\n“Tangent Space”\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is associated with each point of the manifold\n\\(M\\). Paraphrasing Weyl, the situation is as follows: We assume that\nwe can associate a copy \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) of a given Klein space with\neach point \\(p\\) of the manifold \\(M\\) and that the displacement of\nthe Klein space \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) at \\(p \\in M\\) to the Klein space\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p'})\\) associated with an infinitely nearby point\n\\(p'\\in M\\), constitutes an isomorphic representation of\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p'})\\) by means of an infinitesimal\naction of the group \\(G\\). In choosing an admissible frame of\nreference \\(f\\) for each Klein space \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\), their points\nare represented by\nnormal coordinates \\(\\xi\\). Any two frames \n\\(f,f'\\) are related by a group \nelement \\(s \\in G\\), and a succession of transformations\n\\(f \\rightarrow f'\\) and \\(f' \\rightarrow f''\\) by \\(s \\in G\\) and \n\\(t \\in G\\) respectively, relates \\(f\\) and \n\\(f''\\) by the group composition \\(t \\circ s \\in G\\).  \n\nNothing so far has been said about how specifically the \n“Tangent Space” \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is connected to the manifold. \nSince \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is supposed to be a \ngeneralization of the ordinary tangent space which arises \nintrinsically from the local differential structure of \\(M\\), Weyl\nsuggests that certain embedding conditions have to be imposed on the \nnormal coordinates \\(\\xi\\) of the Klein space \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\).  \nEmbedding Condition 1: We must first designate\na point as the center of \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) and then require that they\ncoincide or cover the point \\(p \\in M\\). This leads, Weyl says, to a\nrestriction in the choice of a normal coordinate system\n\\(\\xi\\) on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\). And because \\(G\\) acts transitively, a\nnormal coordinate system \\(\\xi\\) on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) can be chosen\nsuch that the normal coordinates \\(\\xi\\) vanish at the center, that\nis, \\(\\xi^{1} = \\xi^{2} = \\cdots = 0\\). The group \\(G\\) is therefore\nrestricted to the subgroup \\(G_{0}\\) of all representations of \\(G\\)\nwhich leave the center invariant.\n \nEmbedding Condition 2: The notion of a tangent\nplane also requires that there is a one-to-one linear mapping between\nthe line elements of \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) starting \nfrom 0, with the line elements of \\(M\\) starting from \\(p\\). \nThis means that the number of dimension of the Klein space \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) has the same number of dimension\nas the manifold \\(M\\). \nEmbedding Condition 3: The infinitesimal \ndisplacement \\(\\Sigma(M_{p}) \\rightarrow \\Sigma(M_{p'})\\) will carry an \ninfinitesimal vector at the center of \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\), which is in one-to-one \ncorrespondence with a vector at \\(p \\in M\\), to the \ncenter of \\(\\Sigma(M_{p'})\\).  \n\nNo further conditions need be imposed according to Weyl. If we\ndisplace \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) by successive steps around a curve\n\\(\\gamma\\) back to the point \\(p \\in M\\) then the final position of\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is obtained from its original poition or orientation\nby a certain automorphism \\(\\Sigma(M_{p}) \\rightarrow\n\\Sigma(M_{p})\\). This automorphism is Cartan’s generalization of\nRiemann’s concept of curvature along the curve \\(\\gamma\\) on\n\\(M\\).  \n\nAccording to Weyl, the “Tangent Space”\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is not uniquely determined by the differential\nstructure of \\(M\\). If \\(G\\) were the affine group, Weyl says, then\nthe conditions above would fully specify the normal\ncoordinate system \\(\\xi^{\\alpha}\\) on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) as a function\nof the chosen local coordinates \\(x^{i}\\) on \\(M\\). Since this is not\nthe case if \\(G\\) is a more extensive group than the affine group,\nWeyl concludes that the\n“Tangent Space” \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) “is not as yet uniquely \ndetermined by the nature of \\(M\\), and so long as this is not \naccomplished we can not say that Cartan’s theory deals only with the \nmanifold \\(M\\).” Weyl adds:  \n\nConversely, the tangent plane in \\(p\\) in the ordinary sense, that\nis, the linear manifold of line elements in \\(p\\), is a centered \naffine space; its group \\(G\\) is not a matter of convention. This \nhas always appeared to me to be a deficiency of the theory …. \n\nThe reader may wish to consult Ryckman (2005, 171–173), who \nargues “that a philosophical contention, indeed, \nphenomenological one, underlies the stated mathematical reasons that \nkept him [Weyl] for a number of years from concurring with Cartan’s \n”moving frame“ approach to differential geometry”.  \n\nIn 1949 Weyl explicitly acknowledged and praised Cartan’s approach. \nUnlike his earlier critical remarks, he now considered it to be a \nvirtue that the frame of reference in \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is independent of the choice of \ncoordinates on \\(M\\). Weyl (1949b) says of the traditional \napproach and Cartan’s new approach to geometry:  \n\nHence we have here before us the natural general basis on which that \nnotion rests. The infinitesimal trend in geometry initiated by Gauss’\ntheory of curved surfaces now merges with that other line of thought \nthat culminated in Klein’s Erlanger program.  \n\nIt is not advisable to bind the frame of reference in \\(\\Sigma_{p}\\)\nto the coordinates \\(x^{i}\\) covering the neighborhood of \\(p\\) in\n\\(M\\). In this respect the old treatment of affinely connected\nmanifolds is misleading. … [I]n the modern development of\ninfinitesimal geometry in the large, where it combines with topology\nand the associated Klein spaces appear under the name of fibres, it\nhas been found best to keep the répères, the\nframes of the fibre spaces, independent of the coordinates of the\nunderlying manifold. \n\nMoreover, in 1949, Weyl also emphasizes that it is necessary to \nemploy Cartan’s method if one wishes to fit Dirac’s theory of the \nelectron into general relativity. Weyl (1949b) says:  \n\nWhen one tries to fit Dirac’s theory of the electron into general \nrelativity, it becomes imperative to adopt the Cartan method. For \nDirac’s four \\(\\psi\\)-components are relative to a Cartesian (or rather \na Lorentz) frame. One knows how they transform under transition from \none Lorentz frame to another (spin representation of the Lorentz \ngroup); but this law of transformation is of such a nature that it \ncannot be extended to arbitrary linear transformations mediating \nbetween affine frames. \n\nWeyl is here referring to his three important papers, which appeared \nin 1929—the same year in which he had published his detailed \ncritique of Cartan’s method—in which he investigates the \nadaptation of Dirac’s theory of the special relativistic electron to \nthe theory of general relativity, and where he develops the \ntetrad or Vierbein formalism for the representation\nof local two-component spinor structures on Lorentz \nmanifolds.  \n\nOnly a year after Pauli’s review article in 1921, in which Pauli had \nargued that Weyl’s defence of his unified field theory deprives it of\nits inherent convincing power from a physical point of view, \nSchrödinger (1922) suggested the possibility that Weyl’s 1918 \ngauge theory could suitably be employed in the quantum mechanical \ndescription of the \n electron.[91]\n Similar proposals were subsequently made by Fock (1926) and London \n(1927).  \n\nWith the advent of the quantum theory of the electron around 1927/28 \nWeyl abandoned his gauge theory of 1918. He did so because in the new\nquantum theory a different kind of gauge invariance associated with \nDirac’s theory of the electron was discovered which, as had been \nsuggested by Fock (1926) and London (1927), more adequately accounted\nfor the conservation of electric \n charge.[92]\n Why did Weyl hold on to his gauge theory for almost a decade despite \na preponderance of compelling empirical arguments that were mounted \nagainst it by Einstein, Pauli and \n others?[93]\n In one of Weyl’s (1918/1998) last letters to Einstein concerning his \nunified field theory, Weyl made it clear that it was mathematics \nand not physics that was the driving force behind his unified \nfield \n theory.[94] \n\nIncidentally, you must not believe that it was because of physics \nthat I introduced the linear differential form d\\(\\varphi\\) in addition \nto the quadratic form. I wanted rather to eliminate this \n“inconsistency” which always has been a bone of \ncontention to \n me.[95]\n And then, to my surprise, I realized that it looked as if it might \nexplain electricity. You clap your hands above your head and shout: \nBut physics is not made this way! \n\nAs London (1927, 376–377) remarks, one must admire Weyl’s \nimmense courage in developing his gauge invariant interpretation of \nelectromagnetism and holding on to it on the mere basis of purely \nformal considerations. London observes that the principle of \nequivalence of inertial and gravitational mass, which prompted \nEinstein to provide a geometrical interpretation of gravity, was at \nleast a physical fact underlying gravitational theory. In contrast, \nan analogous fact was not known in the theory of electricity; \nconsequently, it would seem that there was no compelling physical \nreason to think that rigid rods and ideal clocks would be under the \nuniversal influence of the electromagnetic field. To the contrary, \nLondon says, experience strongly suggests that atomic clocks exhibit \nsharp spectral lines that are unaffected by their history in the \npresence of a magnetic field, contrary to Weyl’s non-integrability \nassumption. London concludes, that in the face of such elementary \nempirical facts it must have been an unusually clear metaphysical \nconviction which prevented Weyl from abandoning his idea that nature \nought to make use of the beautiful geometrical possibilities that a \npure infinitesimal geometry offers.  \n\nIn 1955, shortly before his death, Weyl wrote an \n addendum[96]\n to his 1918 paper Gravitation und \nElektrizität, in which he looks back at \nhis early attempt to find a unified field theory and explains why he \nreinterpreted his gauge theory of 1918, a decade later.  \n\nThis work stands at the beginning of attempts to construct a \n“unified field theory” which subsequently were continued \nby many, it seems to me, without decisive results. As is known, the \nproblem relentlessly occupied Einstein in particular, until his end. \n… The strongest argument for my theory appeared to be that \ngauge invariance corresponds to the principle of the conservation of \nelectric charge just as coordinate invariance corresponds to the \nconservation theorem of energy-impulse. Later, quantum theory \nintroduced the Schrödinger-Dirac potential \\(\\psi\\) of the \nelectron-positron field; the latter revealed an experimentally based \nprinciple of gauge invariance which guaranteed the conservation of \ncharge and which connected the \\(\\psi\\) with the electromagnetic \npotentials \\(\\varphi_{i}\\) in the same way that my \nspeculative theory had connected the gravitational potentials \n\\(g_{ik}\\) with \\(\\varphi_{i}\\), where,\nin addition, the \\(\\varphi_{i}\\) are measured in known \natomic rather than unknown cosmological units. I have no doubts that \nthe principle of gauge invariance finds its correct place here and \nnot, as I believed in 1918, in the interaction of electromagnetism \nand gravity. \n\nBy the late 1920s Weyl’s methodological approach to gauge theory \nunderwent an “empirical turn”. In contrast to \\(a\\) \npriori geometrical reasoning, which guided his early \nunification attempts—Weyl calls it a “speculative \ntheory” in the above citation—by 1928/1929 Weyl \nemphasized experimentally-based principles which underlie \ngauge \n invariance.[97] \n\nIn early 1928 P. A. M. Dirac provided the first physically compelling\ntheoretical account of the dynamics of an electron in the presence of\nan electric field. The components \\(\\psi^{i} (x)\\)\nof Dirac’s four-component wave function or spinor field in \nMinkowski space, \\(\\psi(x) = (\\psi^{1}(x), \\psi^{2}(x), \\psi^{3}(x), \n\\psi^{4}(x))\\), are complex-valued functions that \nsatisfy Dirac’s first-order partial differential equation and provide\nprobabilistic information about the electron’s dynamical behaviour, \nsuch as angular momentum and location. Prior to the appearance of \nspinor fields \\(\\psi\\) in Dirac’s equation, it was generally \nthought that scalars, vectors and tensors provided an adequate system\nof mathematical objects that would allow one to provide a \nmathematical description of reality independently of the choice of \ncoordinates or reference \n frames.[98]\n For example, spin zero particles \\((\\pi\\) mesons, \\(\\alpha\\) particles) \ncould be described by means of scalars; spin 1 particles (deuterons) \nby vectors, and spin 2 particles (hypothetical gravitons) by tensors.\nHowever, the most frequently occurring particles in Nature are \nelectrons, protons, and neutrons. They are spin \n\\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\) particles, called fermions that \nare properly described by mathematical objects called \nspinors, which are neither scalars, vectors or \n tensors.[99]\n Weyl referred to the \\(\\psi(x)\\) in Dirac’s equation as the \n“Dirac quantity” and von Neumann called it the \n“\\(\\psi(x)\\)-vector”. Both von Neumann and Weyl, and \nothers, immediately recognized that Dirac had introduced something \nthat was new in theoretical physics. v. Neumann (1928, 876) remarks:  \n\n… \\(\\psi\\) does by no means have the relativistic transformation \nproperties of a common four-vector. … The case of a quantity \nwith four components that is not a four-vector is a case which has \nnever occurred in relativity theory; the Dirac \\(\\psi\\)-vector is the \nfirst example of this type. \n\n(Weyl (1929c)) notes that the spinor representation of the orthogonal\ngroup \\(O(1, 3)\\) cannot be extended to a representation of the \ngeneral linear group \\(GL(n)\\), \\(n = 4\\), with the \nconsequence that it is necessary to employ the Vierbein, \ntetrad or Lorentz-structure formulation of the theory of \ngeneral relativity in order to incorporate Dirac’s spinor fields \n\\(\\psi(x)\\):  \n\nThe tensor calculus is not the proper mathematical instrument to use \nin translating the quantum-theoretic equations of the electron over \ninto the general theory of relativity. Vectors and terms \n[tensors] are so constituted that the law which defines the \ntransformation of their components from one Cartesian set of axes to \nanother can be extended to the most general linear transformation, to\nan affine set of axes. That is not the case for quantity \\(\\psi\\), \nhowever; this kind of quantity belongs to a representation of the \nrotation group which cannot be extended to the affine group. \nConsequently we cannot introduce components of \\(\\psi\\) relative to an \narbitrary coordinate system in general relativity as we can for the \nelectromagnetic potential and field strengths. We must rather \ndescribe the metric at a point \\(p\\) by local Cartesian axes \n\\(e(a)\\) instead of by the \\(g_{pq}\\). \nThe wave field has definite components \n\\(\\psi^{+}_{1}, \\psi^{+}_{2}, \\psi^{-}_{1}, \\psi^{-}_{2}\\) \nrelative to such axes, and we know how they transform on transition to\nany other Cartesian axes in \\(p\\). \n\nImpressed by the initial success of Dirac’s equation of the spinning \nelectron within the special relativistic context, Weyl adapted \nDirac’s special relativistic theory of the electron to the general \ntheory of relativity in three groundbreaking papers (Weyl \n(1929b,c,d)). A complete exposition of this formalism is presented in\n(Weyl (1929b)). O’Raifeartaigh (1997) says of this paper:  \n\nAlthough not fully appreciated at the time, Weyl’s 1929 paper has \nturned out to be one of the seminal papers of the century, both from \nthe philosophical and from the technical point of view. \n\nIn this ground braking paper, as well as in (Weyl (1929c,d)), Weyl \nexplicitly abandons his earlier attempt to unify electromagnetism \nwith the theory of general relativity. In his early attempt he \nassociated the electromagnetic vector potential \n\\(A_{j}(x)\\) with the additional connection \ncoefficients that arise when a conformal structure is reduced to a \nWeyl structure (see §4.1). The important concept of gauge \ninvariance, however, is preserved in his 1929 paper. Rather than \nassociating gauge transformations with the scale or gauge of the \nspacetime metric tensor, Weyl now associates gauge transformations \nwith the phase of the Dirac spinor field \\(\\psi\\) that represents \nmatter. In the introduction of (Weyl (1929b)), which presents in \ndetail the new formalism, Weyl describes his reinterpretation of the \ngauge principle as follows:  \n\nThe Dirac field-equations for \\(\\psi\\) together with the Maxwell \nequations for the four potentials \\(f_{p}\\) of the \nelectromagnetic field have an invariance property which, from a \nformal point of view, is similar to the one that I called gauge \ninvariance in my theory of gravitation and electromagnetism of 1918; \nthe equations remain invariant when one makes the simultaneous \nreplacements  \n\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) is understood to be an arbitrary function of\nposition in the four-dimensional world. Here the factor\n\\(\\bfrac{e}{ch}\\), where \\(- e\\) is the charge of the electron, \\(c\\)\nis the speed of light, and \\(\\bfrac{h}{\\pi}\\) is the quantum of\naction, has been absorbed in \\(f_{p}\\). The connection of this\n“gauge invariance” to the conservation of electric charge\nremains untouched. But an essential difference, which is significant\nfor the correspondence to experience, is that the exponent of the\nfactor multiplying \\(\\psi\\) is not real but purely imaginary. \\(\\psi\\)\nnow assumes the role that \\(ds\\) played in Einstein’s old\ntheory. It seems to me that this new principle of gauge invariance,\nwhich follows not from speculation but from experiment, compellingly\nindicates that the electromagnetic field is a necessary\naccompanying phenomenon, not of gravitation, but of the material wave\nfield represented by \\(\\psi\\). Since gauge invariance includes an\narbitrary function \\(\\lambda\\) it has the character of\n“general” relativity and can naturally only be understood\nin that context. \n\nWeyl then introduces his two-component spinor theory in Minkowski\nspace. Since one of his aims is to adapt Dirac’s theory to the\ncurved spacetime of general relativity, Weyl develops a theory\nof local spinor structures for curved\n spacetime.[100]\n He achieves this by providing a systematic formulation of \nlocal tetrads or Vierbeins (orthonormal basis\nvectors). Orthonormal frames had already been introduced as early as\n1900 by Levi-Civita and Ricci. Somewhat later, Cartan had shown the\nusefulness of employing local orthonormal-basis vector fields, the\nso-called “moving frames” in his investigation of\nRiemannian geometry in the 1920s. In addition, Einstein (1928) had\nused tetrads or Vierbeins in his attempt to unify gravitation and\nelectricity by resorting to distant parallelism\nwith torsion. In Einstein’s theory, the effects of\ngravity and electromagnetism are associated with a specialized torsion\nof spacetime rather than with the curvature of spacetime. Since the\ncurvature vanishes everywhere, distant parallelism is a feature of\nEinstein’s theory. However, distant parallelism appeared to Weyl\nto be quite unnatural from the viewpoint of Riemannian geometry. Weyl\nexpressed his criticism in all three papers (Weyl (1929b,c,d)) and he\ncontrasted the way in which Vierbeins are employed in his own work\nwith the way they were used by Einstein. In the introduction Weyl\n(1929b) says:  \n\nI prefer not to believe in distant parallelism for a number of \nreasons. First, my mathematical attitude resists accepting such an \nartificial geometry; it is difficult for me to understand the force \nthat would keep the local tetrads at different points and in rotated \npositions in a rigid relationship. There are, I believe, two \nimportant physical reasons as well. In particular, by loosening the \nrigid relationship between the tetrads at different points, the gauge\nfactor \\(e^{i\\lambda}\\), which remains arbitrary \nwith respect to the quantity \\(\\psi\\), changes from a constant to an \narbitrary function of spacetime location; that is, only through the \nloosening of the rigidity does the actual gauge invariance become \nunderstandable. Secondly, the possibility to rotate the tetrads at \ndifferent points independently from each other, is as we shall see, \nequivalent to the symmetry of the energy-momentum tensor or with the \nvalidity of its conservation law. \n\nEvery tetrad uniquely determines the pseudo-Riemannian spacetime\nmetric \\(g_{ij}\\). However, the converse does not hold since the\ntetrad has 16 independent components whereas the spacetime metric,\n\\(g_{ij} = g_{ji}\\), has only 10 independent components. The extra 6\ndegrees of freedom of the tetrads that are not determined by the\nmetric may be represented by the elements of a 6-parameter internal\nLorentz group. That is, the local tetrads are determined by the\nspacetime metric up to local Lorentz transformations. The tetrad\nformalism made it possible, therefore, for Weyl to derive, as a\nspecial case of Noether’s second\n theorem[101],\n the energy-momentum conservation laws for general coordinate\ntransformations and the internal Lorentz transformations of the\ntetrads. Moreover, Weyl had always emphasized the strong analogy\nbetween gravitation and electricity. The tetrad formalism and the\nconservation laws both made explicit and supported this analogy.  \n\nWeyl introduced the final section of his seminal 1929 paper saying \n“We now come to the critical part of the theory”, and \npresented a derivation of electromagnetism from the new gauge \nprinciple. The initial step in Weyl’s derivation exploits the \nintrinsic gauge freedom of his two-component theory of spinors for \nMinkowski space, namely  \n\nwhere the gauge factor is a constant. Since Weyl wished to adapt his \ntheory to the curved spacetime of general relativity, the above phase\ntransformation must be generalized to accommodate local \ntetrads. That is, each spacetime point has its own tetrad and \ntherefore its own point-dependent gauge factor. The phase \ntransformation is thus given by  \n\nwhere the \\(\\lambda(x)\\) is a function of spacetime. Weyl says:  \n\nWe come now to the critical part of the theory. In my view the origin\nand the necessity for the electromagnetic field lie in the following \njustification. The components \\(\\psi_{1},\\psi_{2}\\) \nare, in fact, not uniquely determined by the tetrad but only to the \nextent that they can still be multiplied by an arbitrary \n“gauge-factor” \\(e^{i\\lambda}\\) of \nabsolute value 1. The transformation of the \\(\\psi\\) induced by a \nrotation of the tetrad is determined only up to such a factor. In the\nspecial theory of relativity one must regard this gauge factor as a \nconstant, since we have here only a single point-independent tetrad. \nThis is different in the general theory of relativity. Every point \nhas its own tetrad, and hence its own arbitrary gauge factor, because\nthe gauge factor necessarily becomes an arbitrary function of \nposition through the removal of the rigid connection between tetrads \nat different points. \n\nToday, the concept of gauge invariance plays a central role in \ntheoretical physics. Not until 1954 did Yang and Mills (1954) \ngeneralize Weyl’s electromagnetic gauge concept to the case of the \nnon-Abelian group \n \\(O(3)\\).[102]\n Although Weyl’s reinterpretation of gauge invariance had been \npreceded by suggestions from London and Fock, it was Weyl, according \nto O’Raifeartaigh and Straumann (2000),  \n\nwho emphasized the role of gauge invariance as a symmetry \nprinciple from which electromagnetism can be derived. It took \nseveral decades until the importance of this symmetry \nprinciple—in its generalized form to non-Abelian gauge groups \ndeveloped by Yang, Mills, and others—also became fruitful for a\ndescription of the weak and strong interactions. The mathematics of \nthe non-Abelian generalization of Weyl’s 1929 paper would have been \nan easy task for a mathematician of his rank, but at the time there \nwas no motivation for this from the physics side. \n\nIt is interesting in this context to consider the following remarks \nby Yang. Referring to Einstein’s objection to Weyl’s 1918 gauge \ntheory, Yang (1986, 18) asked, “what has happened to Einstein’s\noriginal objection after quantum mechanics inserted an \\(-i\\) into\nthe scale factor and made it into a phase factor?” Yang \ncontinuous:  \n\nApparently no one had, after 1929, relooked at Einstein’s objection \nuntil I did in 1983. The result is interesting and deserves perhaps \nto be a footnote in the history of science: Let us take Einstein’s \nGedankenexperiment …. When the two clocks come back, because \nof the insertion of the factor \\(-i\\), they would not have \ndifferent scales but different phases. That would not influence their\nrates of time-keeping. Therefore, Einstein’s original objection \ndisappears. But you can ask a further question: Can one measure their\nphase difference? Well, to measure a phase difference one must do an \ninterference experiment. Nobody knows how to do an interference \nexperiment with big objects like clocks. However, one can do \ninterference experiments with electrons. So let us change Einstein’s \nGedankenexperiment to one of bringing electrons back along two \ndifferent paths and ask: Can one measure the phase difference? The \nanswer is yes. That was in fact a most important development in 1959 \nand 1960 when Aharonov and Bohm realized—completely \nindependently of Weyl—that electromagnetism has some meaning \nwhich was not understood \n before.[103] \n\nWe end the discussion on Weyl’s gauge theory by quoting the following\nremarks by Dyson (1983).  \n\nA more recent example of a great discovery in mathematical physics \nwas the idea of a gauge field, invented by Hermann Weyl in 1918. This\nidea has taken only 50 years to find its place as one of the basic \nconcepts of modern particle physics. Quantum chromodynamics, the most\nfashionable theory of the particle physicists in 1981, is \nconceptually little more than a synthesis of Lie’s group-algebras \nwith Weyl’s gauge fields.  \n\nThe history of Weyl’s discovery is quite unlike the history of Lie \ngroups and Grassmann algebras. Weyl was neither obscure nor \nunrecognized, and he was working in 1918 in the most fashionable area\nof physics, the newborn theory of general relativity. He invented \ngauge fields as a solution of the fashionable problem of unifying \ngravitation with electromagnetism. For a few months gauge fields were\nat the height of fashion. Then it was discovered by Weyl and others \nthat they did not do what was expected of them. Gauge fields were in \nfact no good for the purpose for which Weyl invented them. They \nquickly became unfashionable and were almost forgotten. But then, \nvery gradually over the next fifty years, it became clear that gauge \nfields were important in a quite different context, in the theory of \nquantum electrodynamics and its extensions leading up to the recent \ndevelopment of quantum chromodynamics. The decisive step in the \nrehabilitation of gauge fields was taken by our Princeton colleague \nFrank Yang and his student Bob Mills in 1954, one year before Hermann\nWeyl’s death [Yang and Mills, 1954]. There is no evidence that Weyl \never knew or cared what Yang and Mills had done with his brain-child.\n \n\nSo the story of gauge fields is full of ironies. A fashionable idea, \ninvented for a purpose which turns out to be ephemeral, survives a \nlong period of obscurity and emerges finally as a corner-stone of \nphysics. \n\nIt is remarkable that Weyl’s (1929b) two-component spinor formalism \nled him to anticipate the existence of particles that violate \nconservation of parity, that is, left-right symmetry. In 1929 \nleft-right symmetry was taken for granted and considered a basic fact\nof all the laws of Nature. Weyl formulated the four-component Dirac \nspinor \\(\\psi\\) in terms of a two-component left-handed Weyl spinor \n\\(\\psi_{L}\\) and a two-component right-handed Weyl spinor\n\\(\\psi_{R}\\):  \n\nThe four-component Dirac spinor, formulated in terms of the two Weyl \nspinors  \n\npreserves parity; it applies to all massive spin \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\)\nparticles (fermions) and all massive fermions are known to obey parity\nconservation. However, a single Weyl spinor, either \\(\\psi_{L}\\) or\n\\(\\psi_{R}\\), does not preserve parity. Weyl noted that instead of the\nfour-component Dirac spinor “two components suffice if the\nrequirement of left-right symmetry (parity) is dropped”. A\nlittle later he added, “the restriction 2 removes the\nequivalence of left and right.  It is only the fact that left-right\nsymmetry actually appears in Nature that forces us to introduce a\nsecond pair of \\(\\psi\\)-components”. Weyl’s two-spinor\nversion of the Dirac equation is a coupled system of\nequations requiring both Weyl spinors \\(\\psi_{L}\\) and \\(\\psi_{R}\\) in\norder to preserve parity. Weyl considerd massless particles in his\ntwo-spinor version of the Dirac equation.  In this case, the equations\nof the two-spinor version of Dirac’s equation decouple,\nyielding an equation for \\(\\psi_{L}\\) and for \\(\\psi_{R}\\). These\nequations are independent of each other, and the equation for the\n2-component left-handed Weyl spinor \\(\\psi_{L}\\) is\ncalled Weyl’s equation; it is applicable to the\nmassless particle called the\n neutrino[104],\na spin \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\) particle, that was discovered in 1956. Yang\n(1986, 12) remarks  \n\nNow I come to another piece of work of Weyl’s which dates back to \n1929, and is called Weyl’s two-component neutrino theory. He invented\nthis theory in 1929 in one of his very important articles … as\na mathematical possibility satisfying most of the requirements of \nphysics. But it was rejected by him and by subsequent physicists \nbecause it did not satisfy left-right symmetry. With the realisation \nthat left-right symmetry was not exactly right in 1957 it became \nclear that this theory of Weyl’s should immediately be re-looked at. \nSo it was and later it was verified theoretically and experimentally \nthat this theory gave, in fact, the correct description of the \nneutrino. \n\nDuring the interval from 1924–26, in which Weyl was intensely \noccupied with the pure mathematics of Lie groups, the essentials of \nthe formal apparatus of the new revolutionary theory of quantum \nmechanics had been completed by Heisenberg, Schrödinger and \nothers. As if to make up for lost time, Weyl immediately returned \nfrom pure mathematics to theoretical physics, and applied his new \ngroup theoretical results to quantum mechanics. As Yang (1986, 9, 10)\ndescribes it,  \n\nIn the midst of Weyl’s profound research on Lie groups there\noccurred a great revolution in physics, namely the development of\nquantum mechanics. We shall perhaps never know Weyl’s initial\nreaction to this development, but he soon got into the act and studied\nthe mathematical structure of the new mechanics. There resulted a\npaper of 1927 and later a book, this book together with Wigner’s\narticles and Gruppen Theorie und Ihre Anwendung auf die Quanten\nMechanik der Atome were instrumental in introducing group theory\ninto the very language of quantum mechanics. \n\nMehra and Rechenberg (2000, 482) note in this context: \n“Actually, we have mentioned in previous volumes Weyl’s early \nreactions to both matrix mechanics (in 1925) and wave mechanics (in \nearly 1926), and they were very enthusiastic. Therefore, we have to \nassume quite firmly that it was only his deep involvement with the \nlast stages of his work on the theory of semisimple continuous groups\nthat prevented Weyl ‘to get in the act’ \nimmediately.”  \n\nWeyl was particularly well positioned to handle some of the \nmathematical and foundational problems of the new theory of quantum \nmechanics. Almost every aspect of his mathematical expertise, in \nparticular, his recent work on group theory and his very early work \non the theory of singular differential-integral equations \n(1908–1911), provided him with the precise tools for solving \nmany of the concrete problems posed by the new theory: the theory of \nHilbert space, singular differential equations, eigenfunction \nexpansions, the symmetric group, and unitary representations of Lie \ngroups.  \n\nWeyl’s (1927) paper, referred to by Yang above, is entitled \nQuantenmechanik und Gruppentheorie (Quantum Mechanics \nand Group Theory). In it, Weyl provides an analysis of the \nfoundations of quantum mechanics and he emphasizes the fundamental \nrole Lie groups play in that \n theory.[105]\n Weyl begins the paper by raising two questions: (1) how do I arrive \nat the self-adjoint operators, which represent a given quantity of a \nphysical system whose constitution is known, and (2), what is the \nphysical interpretation of these operators and which physical \nconsequences can be derived from them? Weyl suggests that while the \nsecond question has been answered by von Neumann, the first question \nhas not yet received a satisfactory answer, and Weyl proposes to \nprovide one with the help of group theory.  \n\nIn a way, Weyl’s 1927 paper was programmatic in character; nearly all\nthe topics of that paper were taken up again a year later in his \nfamous book (Weyl (1928)) entitled Gruppentheorie und \nQuantenmechanik (The Theory of Groups and Quantum \nMechanics). The book emerged from the lecture notes taken by a \nstudent named F. Bohnenblust of Weyl’s lectures given in Zürich \nduring the winter semester 1927–28. A revised edition of that \nbook appeared in 1931. In the preface to the first edition Weyl says:\n \n\nAnother time I venture on stage with a book that belongs only half to\nmy professional field of mathematics, the other half to physics. The \nexternal reason is not very different from that which led some time \nago to the origin of the book Raum Zeit Materie. In the \nwinter term 1927/28 Zürich was suddenly deprived of all \ntheoretical physics by the simultaneous departures of Debye and \nSchrödinger. I tried to fill the gap by changing an already \nannounced lecture course on group theory into one on group theory and\nquantum mechanics. \n … \nSince I have for some years been deeply occupied with the theory of\nthe representation of continuous groups, it appeared to me at this\npoint to be a fitting and useful project, to provide an organically\ncoherent account of the knowledge in this field won by mathematicians,\non such a scale and in such a form, that is suitable for the\nrequirements of quantum physics. \n\nWeyl’s book is one of the first textbooks on the new theory of \nquantum mechanics. As Weyl indicates in the preface it was necessary \nfor him to include a short account of the foundation of quantum \ntheory in order to be able to show how the theory of groups finds its\napplication in that theory. If the book fulfils its purpose, Weyl \nsuggests, then the reader should be able to learn from it the \nessentials of both the theory of groups and quantum theory. Weyl’s \naim was to explain the mathematics to the physicists and the physics \nto the mathematicians. However, as Yang (1986, 10) points out, \nreferring to Weyl’s book:  \n\nWeyl was a mathematician and a philosopher. He liked to deal with \nconcepts and the connection between them. His book was very famous, \nand was recognized as profound. Almost every theoretical physicist \nborn before 1935 has a copy of it on his bookshelves. But very few \nread it: Most are not accustomed to Weyl’s concentration on the \nstructural aspects of physics and feel uncomfortable with his \nemphasis on concepts. The book was just too abstract for most \nphysicists. \n\nWeyl’s book (Weyl (1931b, 2 edn)) is remarkably complete for such an \nearly work and covers many topics. Chapters I and III are mainly \nconcerned with preliminary mathematical concepts. The first chapter \nprovides an account of the theory of finite dimensional Hilbert \nspaces and the third chapter is an exposition of the unitary \nrepresentation theory of finite groups and compact Lie groups. \nChapter II is entitled Quantum Theory; it is the earliest \nsystematic and comprehensive account of the new quantum theory. \nChapter IV, entitled Application of the Theory of Groups\nto Quantum Mechanics, is divided into four parts. In part A, \nentitled The Rotation Group, Weyl provides a systematic \nexplanatory account of the theory of atomic spectra in terms of the \nunitary representation theory of the rotation group, followed by a \ndiscussion of the selection and intensity rules. Part B is entitled \nThe Lorentz Group. After discussing the spin of the electron\nand its role in accounting for the anomalous Zeeman effect, Weyl \npresents Dirac’s theory of the relativistic quantum mechanics of the \nelectron and develops in detail the theory of an electron in a \nspherically symmetric field, including an analysis of the fine \nstructure of the spectrum. In part C, entitled The Permutation \nGroup, Weyl applies the Pauli exclusion principle to explicate \nthe periodic table of the elements. Next, Weyl develops the second \nquantization of the Maxwell and Dirac fields required for the \nanalysis of many body relativistic systems. Weyl noted in the preface\nto the second edition that his treatment is in accordance with the \nrecent work of Heisenberg and Pauli. It is now customary to include \nsuch a topic under the heading of relativistic quantum field theory. \nThe final part of Chapter IV, part D, is entitled Quantum \nKinematics; it provides an exposition of part II of Weyl’s \n(1927) paper, mentioned earlier. Chapter V, entitled The \nSymmetric Permutation Group and the Algebra of Symmetric \nTransformations, is for the most part pure mathematics. It is \nwidely regraded to be the most difficult part of the Weyl’s book.  \n\nOverall, Weyl’s treatment is quite modern except for the confusion \nregarding the positive electron (anti-electron) that at that time was\nidentified with the proton rather than with the positron, which was \ndiscovered a few years later. Weyl was quite concerned about the \nidentification of the proton with the positive electron because his \nanalysis of the discrete symmetries \\(\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{P}, \\mathbf{T}\\) and \n\\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\) led him to conclude that the mass of the positive electron\nshould equal the mass of the \n electron.[106] \n\nWeyl (1931b, 2 edn) analyzed Dirac’s relativistic theory of the \nelectron (Dirac (1928a,b)). Although this theory correctly accounted \nfor the spin of the electron, there was however a problem because in \naddition to the positive-energy levels, Dirac’s theory predicted the \nexistence of an equal number of negative-energy levels. Dirac (1930) \nreinterpreted the theory by assuming that all of the negative-energy \nlevels were normally occupied. The Pauli Exclusion Principle, which \nasserts that it is impossible for two electrons to occupy the same \nquantum state, would prevent an electron with positive energy from \nfalling into a negative- energy state. Dirac’s theory also predicted \nthat one of the negative-energy electrons could be raised to a state \nof positive energy, thereby creating a ‘hole’ or \nunoccupied negative-energy state. Such a hole would behave like a \nparticle with a positive energy and a positive charge, that is, like \na positive electron.  \n\nBecause the only fundamental particles that were known to exist at \nthat time were the electron and the proton, one was justifiably \nreluctant to postulate the existence of new particles that had not \nyet been observed experimentally; consequently, it was suggested that\nthe positive electron should be identified with the proton. However, \nWeyl was quite concerned about the identification of the proton with \nthe anti-electron. In the preface to the second German edition of his\nbook Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik, Weyl (1928, 2 edn, \n1931, VII) wrote  \n\nThe problem of the proton and the electron is discussed in connection\nwith the symmetry properties of the quantum laws with respect to the \ninterchange of right and left, past and future, and positive and \nnegative electricity. At present no acceptable solution is in sight; \nI fear, that in the context of this problem, the clouds are rolling \ntogether to form a new, serious crisis in quantum physics. \n\nWeyl had good reasons for his concern. He analyzed the invariance of \nthe Maxwell-Dirac equations under the discrete symmetries that \ncorrespond to the transformations now called \\(\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{P}, \n\\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\) both for the case of relativistic quantum \nmechanics and for the case of relativistic quantum field theory, and \nconcluded in both cases that the mass of the anti-electron should be \nthe same as the mass of the electron. That the mass of the proton was\nso different from the mass of the electron, therefore, appeared to \nWeyl to constitute a new serious crisis in physics.  \n\nIn a lecture presented at the Centenary for Hermann Weyl held at the \nETH in Zürich, Yang (1986, 10) says of the above quote from \nWeyl’s preface to the second edition of Gruppentheorie und \nQuantenmechanik:  \n\nThis was a most remarkable passage in retrospect. The symmetry that \nhe mentioned here, of physical laws with respect to the interchange \nof right and left, had been introduced by Weyl and Wigner \nindependently into quantum physics. It was called parity \nconservation, denoted by the symbol \\(P\\). The symmetry between \nthe past and future was something that was not well understood in \n1930. It was understood later by Wigner, was called time reversal \ninvariance, and was denoted by the symbol \\(T\\). The symmetry with\nrespect to positive and negative electricity was later called charge \nconjugation invariance \\(C\\). It is a symmetry of physical laws \nwhen you change positive and negative signs of electricity. Nobody, \nto my knowledge, absolutely nobody in the year 1930, was in any way \nsuspecting that these symmetries were related in any manner. I will \ncome back to this matter later. What had prompted Weyl in 1930 to \nwrite the above passage is a great mystery to me. \n\nIt would seem that Yang’s comment is misleading since it\nsuggests that Weyl did not have a good reason for his remark. In fact,\nhowever, Weyl’s statement was firmly based on a detailed\nanalysis of the discrete symmetries \\(\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{P},\n\\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\).  Coleman and Korté (2001)\nhave shown in detail that Weyl’s treatment of these symmetries\nis the same as that used today except for the fact that the\nsymmetry \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) is treated by Weyl as linear and unitary,\nrather than as antilinear and antiunitary. Weyl had presented in 1931\na complete analysis, in the context of the quantized Maxwell-Dirac\nfield equations, of the discrete symmetries that are now called\n\\(\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{P}, \\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\). His\ntransformations \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) are the same as\nthose used today. His transformations \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\) are also very close to those used today except that\nWeyl’s transformations were linear and unitary rather than\nantilinear and antiunitary.  Moreover, Weyl drew two very\nimportant conclusions from his analysis of these discrete\nsymmetries. First, Weyl announced that the important question of the\narrow of time had been solved because the field equations were not\ninvariant under his time-reversal transformation\n\\(\\mathbf{T}\\). Second, Weyl pointed out that the invariance of the\nfield equations under his charge-conjugation transformation\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) implied that the mass of the\n‘anti-electron’ is necessarily the same as that of the\nelectron; moreover, Weyl’s result is the primary reason that\nDirac (1931, 61) abandoned the assignment of the proton to the role of\nthe anti-electron. Many years later Dirac (1977, 145) recalled:  \n\nWell, what was I to do with these holes? The best I could think of \nwas that maybe the mass was not the same as the mass of the electron.\nAfter all, my primitive theory did ignore the Coulomb forces between \nthe electrons. I did not know how to bring those into the picture, \nand it could be that in some obscure way these Coulomb forces would \ngive rise to a difference in the masses.  \n\nOf course, it is very hard to understand how this difference could be\nso big. We wanted the mass of the proton to be nearly 2000 times the \nmass of the electron, an enormous difference, and it was very hard to\nunderstand how it could be connected with just a sort of perturbation\neffect coming from Coulomb forces between the electrons.  \n\nHowever, I did not want to abandon my theory altogether, and so I put\nit forward as a theory of electrons and protons. Of course I was very\nsoon attacked on this question of the holes having different masses \nfrom the original electrons. I think the most definite attack came \nfrom Weyl, who pointed out that mathematically the holes would have \nto have the same mass as the electrons, and that came to be the \naccepted view. \n\nAt another place Dirac (1971, 52–55) remarks:  \n\nBut still, I thought there might be something in the basic idea and \nso I published it as a theory of electrons and protons, and left it \nquite unexplained how the protons could have such a different mass \nfrom the electrons.  \n\nThis idea was seized upon by Herman [sic] Weyl. He said boldly that \nthe holes had to have the same mass as the electrons. Now Weyl was a \nmathematician. He was not a physicist at all. He was just concerned \nwith the mathematical consequences of an idea, working out what can \nbe deduced from the various symmetries. And this mathematical \napproach led directly to the conclusion that the holes would have to \nhave the same mass as the electrons. Weyl just published a blunt \nstatement that the holes must have the same mass as the electrons and\ndid not make any comments on the physical implications of this \nassertion. Perhaps he did not really care what the physical \nimplications were. He was just concerned with achieving consistent \nmathematics. \n\nDirac’s characterization of Weyl’s unconcern for physics seems unfair\nin light of Weyl’s own statement in the preface of the second edition\nof his book, cited earlier, where he expresses the fear “that \nin the context of this problem, the clouds are rolling together to \nform a new, serious crisis in quantum physics”; Weyl did care \nabout the physics.  \n\nWeyl’s analysis did have a significant impact on the development of \nthe Maxwell-Dirac theory; however, as Coleman and Korté (2001)\nhave argued, Weyl’s early analysis of the transformations \\(\\mathbf{C}, \n\\mathbf{P}, \\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\) was, for the most part, lost to \nsubsequent researchers and had to be essentially re-invented. \nHowever, it should be noted in this context that Schwinger (1988, \n107–129) was greatly influenced by Weyl’s book. Schwinger makes\nparticular reference to Weyl’s work on the discrete symmetries and \nsays that this work “… was the starting point of my own \nconsiderations concerning the connection between spin and statistics,\nwhich culminated in what is now referred to as the TCP—or some\npermutation thereof—theorem”.  \n\nWeyl analyzed the foundations of both the general theory of \nrelativity and the theory of quantum mechanics. For both theories, he\nprovided a coherent exposition of the mathematical structure of the \ntheory, elegant characterizations of the entities and laws postulated\nby the theory and a lucid account of how these postulates explain the\nmost significant, more directly observable, lower-level phenomena. In\nboth cases, he was also concerned with the constructive aspects of \nthe theory, that is, with the extent to which the higher-level \npostulates of the theory are necessary.  \n\nThere is no doubt that with regard to the general theory of \nrelativity, Weyl held strong philosophical views. Some of these views\nare couched in a phenomenological language and reveal Husserl’s \ninfluence on Weyl. Ryckman’s (2005) study The Reign of Relativity\nprovides an extensive account of Weyl’s orientation to Husserl’s\nphenomenology. On the other hand, many of Weyl’s philosophical views \nare couched in an unequivocal empiricist-realist language. For \nexample, Weyl rejected Poincaré’s geometrical conventionalism \nand forcefully argued that the spacetime metric field is physically \nreal, that it is a physically real structural field (Strukturfeld), \nwhich is determined by the physically real causal (conformal) \nstructure and the physically real inertial (projective) structure or \nguiding field (Führungsfeld) of spacetime. He was not deterred \nin putting forward such ontological claims about the metric structure\nof spacetime despite the fact that a complete epistemologically \nsatisfactory solution to the measurement problem for the spacetime \nmetric field was not then available. In the same manner, Weyl \nforcefully advanced a field-body-relationalist ontology of spacetime \nstructure. He argued that a Leibnizian or Einstein-Machian form of \nrelationalism that is based on a pure body ontology, is not tenable, \nindeed is incoherent within the context of general relativity, and he\npresented a reductio argument, the plasticine example, to \nunderscore the necessity of the existence of a physically real \nguiding field in addition to the existence of bodies.  \n\nHowever, in contrast to Weyl’s many philosophical views with regard \nto spacetime theories, Weyl’s philosophical positions regarding the \nstatus of quantum mechanics, while not absent, are not as \ntransparent. There are passages, such as the following ((Weyl, 1931b,\n2 edn, 44), which argue for the reality of photons.  \n\nThe intensity of the monochromatic radiation that is used to generate\nthe photoelectric effect has no influence on the speed with which the\nelectrons are ejected from the metal but affects only the frequency \nof this process. Even with intensities so weak that on the classical \ntheory hours would be required before the electromagnetic energy \npassing through a given atom would attain to an amount equal to that \nof a photon, the effect begins immediately, the points at which it \noccurs being distributed irregularly over the entire metal plate. \nThis fact is a proof of the existence of light quanta that is no less\nmeaningful than the flashes of light on the scintillation screen are \nfor the corpuscular-discontinuous nature of \\(\\alpha\\)-rays. \n\nOn the other hand, Weyl’s (1931b) discussion of the problem of \n‘directional quantization’ in the old quantum theory and \nof the way that this problem is ‘resolved’ in the new \nquantum theory appears to have a distinctly instrumentalist flavour. \nIn a number of places, he describes the essence of the dilemma posed \nby quantum mechanics with a dispassionate precision. Consider, for \nexample, the following (Weyl, 1931b, 2 edn, 67):  \nNatural science has a constructive character. The phenomena with which\nit deals are not independent manifestations or qualities which can be\nread off from nature, but can only be determined by means of an\nindirect method, through interaction with other bodies. Their implicit\ndefinition is bound up with definite natural laws which underlie the\ninteractions. Consider, for example, the introduction of the Galilean\nconcept of mass which essentially comes down to the following indirect\ndefinition: “Each body possesses a momentum, that is, a vector\n\\(m\\overline{v}\\) which has the same direction as its velocity\n\\(\\overline{v}\\)—the scalar factor \\(m\\) is called its mass. The\nlaw of momentum holds, according to which the sum of the momenta\nbefore a reaction between several bodies is the same as the sum of\ntheir momenta after the reaction.” By applying this law to the\nobserved collision phenomena, one obtains data for the determination\nof the relative masses. The scientific consensus was, however, that\nsuch constructive phenomena can nevertheless be attributed to the\nthings themselves even if the manipulations, which alone can lead\nto their recognition, are not being carried out. In Quantum Theory\nwe encounter a fundamental limitation to this epistemological position\nof the constructive natural science. \n\nIt is difficult for many people to accept quantum mechanics as an \nultimate theory without at the same time giving up some form of \nrealism and adopting something like an instrumentalist view of the \ntheory. It is clear that Weyl was fully aware of this state of \naffairs, and yet in all of his published work, he refrained from \nmaking any bold statements of his views on the fundamental questions \nabout quantum reality. He did not vigorously participate in the \ndebate between Einstein and Schrödinger and the Copenhagen \nSchool nor did he offer decisive views concerning, for example, the \nEinstein, Podolsky, Rosen thought experiment or \nSchrödinger’s Cat. Since Weyl held \nstrong philosophical views within the context of the general theory \nof relativity, it is therefore only natural that one might have \nexpected him to take a stand with respect to Schrödinger’s cat \nand whether or not one should be fully satisfied with a theory \naccording to which the cat is neither alive or dead but is in a \nsuperposition of these two states.  \n\nThe reason for Weyl’s seeming reticence concerning the \nontological/epistemological questions about quantum reality was \nalready hinted at in note 5 of §2, where it was suggested that \nWeyl was not especially bothered by the counterintuitive nature of \nquantum mechanics because he held the view that “objective \nreality cannot be grasped directly, but only through the use of \nsymbols”. Although Weyl (1948, 1949a, 1953) did express his \nphilosophical views about quantum theory, he did so cautiously. Weyl \n(1949a, 263) summarizes some of the features of quantum mechanics \nthat he considered of “paramount philosophical \nsignificance”: the measurement problem, the incompatibility of \nquantum physics with classical logic, quantum causality, the \nnon-local nature of quantum mechanics, the Leibniz-Pauli \nExclusion \n Principle[107],\n and the irreducible probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. At the\nend of the summary Weyl remarks:  \n\nIt must be admitted that the meaning of quantum physics, in spite of \nall its achievements, is not yet clarified as thoroughly as, for \ninstance, the ideas underlying relativity theory. The relation of \nreality and observation is the central problem. We seem to need a \ndeeper epistemological analysis of what constitutes an experiment, a \nmeasurement, and what sort of language is used to communicate its \nresult. \n\nAccording to Weyl (1948, 295), both the theory of general relativity \nand quantum mechanics force upon us the realization that \n“instead of a real spatio-temporal material being what remains \nfor us is only a construction in pure symbols”. If it is \nnecessary, Weyl (1948, 302) says, that our scientific grasp of an \nobjective world must not depend on sense qualities, because of their \ninherent subjective nature, then it is for the same reason necessary \nto eliminate space and time. And Descartes gave us the means to do \nthis with his discovery of analytic geometry.  \n\nAs Weyl (1953, 529) observes, when Newton explained the experienced \nworld through the movements of solid particles in space, he rejected \nsense qualities for the construction of the objective world, but he \nheld on to, and used an intuitively given objective space for the \nconstruction of a real world that lies behind the appearances. It was\nLeibniz who recognized the phenomenal character (Phenomenalität)\nof space and time as consisting in the mere ordering of phenomena; \nhowever, space and time themselves do not have an independent \nreality.  \n\nIt is the freely created pure numbers, that is, pure symbols, \naccording to Weyl, which serve as coordinates, and which provide the \nmaterial with which to symbolically construct the objective world. In\nsymbolically constructing the objective world we are forced to \nreplace space and time through a pure arithmetical construct. Instead\nof spacetime points, \\(n\\)-tuples of pure numbers corresponding to\na given coordinate system are used. Weyl (1948, 303) says:  \n\n… the laws of physics are viewed as arithmetic laws between \nnumerical values of variable magnitudes, in which spatial points and \nmoments of time are represented through their numerical coordinates. \nMagnitudes such as the temperature of a body or the field strength of\nan electric field, which have at each spacetime point a definite \nvalue, appear as functions of four variables, the spacetime \ncoordinates \\(x, y, z, t\\). \n\nIn systematic theorizing we construct a formal scaffold that\nconsists of mere symbols, according to Weyl (1948, 311), without \nexplaining initially what the symbols for mass, charge, field \nstrength, etc., mean; and only toward the end do we describe how the \nsymbolic structure connects directly with experience.  \n\nIt is certain, that on the symbolic side, not space and time but four\nindependent variables \\(x, y, z, t\\) appear; \none speaks of space, as one does of sounds and colours, only on the \nside of conscious experience. A monochromatic light signal … has \nnow become a mathematical formula in which a certain symbol \\(F\\),\ncalled electromagnetic field strength, is expressed as a pure \narithmetically constructed function of four other symbols \n\\(x, y, z, t\\), called spacetime coordinates. \n\nAt another place Weyl (1949a, 113) says:  \n\nIntuitive space and intuitive time are thus hardly the adequate \nmedium in which physics is to construct the external world. No less \nthan the sense qualities must the intuitions of space and time be \nrelinquished as its building material; they must be replaced by a \nfour-dimensional continuum in the abstract arithmetical sense. \n\nWeyl’s point is that while space and time exist within the realm of \nconscious experience, or, according to Kant, as \\(a\\) priori\nforms underlying all of our conscious experiences, they are \nunsuited as elements with which to construct the objective world and \nmust be replaced by means of a purely arithmetical symbolic \nrepresentation. All that we are left with, according to Weyl, is \nsymbolic construction. If this still needed any confirmation, Weyl \n(1948, 313) says, it was provided by the theory of relativity and \nquantum \n theory.[108]\n For ease of reference we repeat a citation of Weyl (1988, 4–5) \nin §4.3.1:  \n\nCoordinates are introduced on the Mf [manifold] in the most direct \nway through the mapping onto the number space, in such a way, that \nall coordinates, which arise through one-to-one continuous \ntransformations, are equally possible. With this the coordinate \nconcept breaks loose from all special constructions to which\nit was bound earlier in geometry. In the language of relativity this \nmeans: The coordinates are not measured, their \nvalues are not read off from real measuring rods which react\nin a definite way to physical fields and the metrical structure, \nrather they are a priori placed in the world arbitrarily, in\norder to characterize those physical fields including the metric\nstructure numerically. The metric structure becomes through \nthis, so to speak, freed from space; it becomes an existing field \nwithin the remaining structure-less space. Through this, space as \nform of appearance contrasts more clearly with its real content: The \ncontent is measured after the form is arbitrarily related to \n coordinates.[109] \n\nThe last two sentences in the above quote suggest that, (a) Weyl \nembraces something close to Kant’s position, according to which space\nand time are “a priori forms of appearances”, or\nthat (b) Weyl adheres to a position called spacetime \nsubstantivalism, according to which, in addition to body and \nfields and their relations, there also exists a \n‘container’, the spacetime manifold, and this manifold, \nits points and the manifold differential-topological relations are \nphysically real. However, this interpretation would contradict Weyl’s\nbasic thesis that in the symbolic construction of the objective word \nwe are left with nothing but symbolic arithmetic functional \nrelations. Weyl’s phrases, do not denote either a physically real \ncontainer or something like Kant’s a priori form of \nintuition. They merely denote a conceptual or formal \nscaffolding, a logical space, as it were, whose points \nare represented by purely formal coordinates \\((n\\)-tuple\nof pure numbers). It is such a formal space which is employed by the \ntheorist in the initial stages of constructing an objective world. To\nemphasize, in modelling the objective world the theorist begins by \nconstructing a formal scaffold which consists of mere \nsymbols and formal coordinates, without explaining initially what the\nsymbols for mass, charge, field strength, etc., mean; only toward the\nend does the theorist describe how the symbolic structure connects \ndirectly with experience ((Weyl, 1948, 311)).  \n\nThe four-dimensional space-time continuum must be replaced by a \nfour-dimensional coordinate space \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\). However, the \nsheer arbitrariness with which we assign coordinates does not affect \nthe objective relations and features of the world itself. To the \ncontrary, it is only relative to a symbolic construction or \nmodelling by means of an assignment of coordinates that the state of \nthe world, its relations and properties, can be objectively \ndetermined by means of distinct, reproducible symbols. While our \nimmediate experiences are subjective and absolute, \nour symbolic construction of the objective world is of \nnecessity relative. Weyl (1949a, 116) says:  \n\nWhoever desires the absolute must take the subjectivity and \negocentricity into the bargain; whoever feels drawn toward the \nobjective faces the problem of relativity. \n\nWeyl (1949a, 75) notes, “The objectification, by elimination of\nthe ego and its immediate life of intuition, does not fully succeed, \nand the coordinate system remains as the necessary residue of the \nego-extinction.” However, this residue of ego involvement is \nsubsequently rendered harmless through the principle of \ninvariance. The transition from one admissible coordinate \nsystem to another can be mathematically described, and the natural \nlaws and measurable quantities must be \ninvariant under such transformations. This, Weyl (1948, 336)\nsays, constitutes the general principle of \nrelativity. Weyl (1949a, 104) says:  \n\n… Only such relations will have objective meaning as are \nindependent of the mapping chosen and therefore remain invariant \nunder deformations of the map. Such a relation is, for instance, the \nintersection of two world lines. If we wish to characterize a special\nmapping or a special class of mappings, we must do so in terms of the\nreal physical events and of the structure revealed in them. That is \nthe content of the postulate of general relativity. \nAccording to the special theory of relativity, it \nis possible in particular to construct a map of the world such that \n(1) the world line of each mass point which is subject to no external\nforces appears as a straight line, and (2) the light cone issuing \nfrom an arbitrary world point is represented by a circular cone with \nvertical axis and a vertex angle of 90°. In this \ntheory the inertial and causal structure and hence also the metrical \nstructure of the world have the character of rigidity, they are \nabsolutely fixed once and for all. It is impossible objectively, \nwithout resorting to individual exhibition, to make a narrower \nselection from among the ‘normal mappings’ satisfying the\nabove conditions (1) and (2). \n\nWeyl (1949a, 115) provides an illustration, which shows how a \nmeasurement by observer \\(B\\) of the angular distance \\(\\delta\\) \nbetween two stars \\(\\Sigma\\) and \\(\\Sigma^{*}\\) can be \nconstructed in the four-dimensional number space, and can be \nexpressed as an \n invariant.[110] Figure 15:\nMeasurement of the angular distance \\(\\delta\\) by an observer \\(B\\)\nbetween two stars \n\nIn figure 15 the stars and observer are represented by their world \nlines, and the past light cone \\(K\\) issuing from the observation \nevent \\(O\\) intersects the world lines of the stars \\(\\Sigma\\) and \n\\(\\Sigma^{*}\\) in \\(E\\) and \n\\(E^{*}\\) respectively. The light rays emitted at \n\\(E\\) and \\(E^{*}\\), which arrive at the \nobservation event \\(O\\), are null geodesics laying on the past \nlight cone and are respectively denoted by \\(\\Lambda\\) and \n\\(\\Lambda^{*}\\). This construction of the numerical \nquantity of the angle \\(\\delta\\) observed by \\(B\\) at \\(O\\), which\nis describable in the form of purely arithmetical relations, is \ninvariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations and constitutes \nan objective fact of the \n world.[111] \n\nOn the other hand, the angles between two stars determine the \nobjectively indescribable subjective experience of \nthe observer. Moreover, Weyl says, “there is no difference in \nour experiences to which there does not correspond a difference in \nthe underlying objective situation.” And that difference is \nitself invariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations. In other\nwords, an observer’s subjective experiences supervene on the\ninvariant relationships and structures of a symbolically constructed \nobjective world.  \n\nPerhaps no statement captures the contrast between the \nobjective-symbolic and the subjective-intuitive more vividly then \nWeyl’s famous statement  \n\nThe objective world simply \\(is\\), it does not happen. \nOnly to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling upward along the life \nline of my body, does a section of this world come to life as a \nfleeting image in space which continuously changes in \n time.[112]","contact.mail":"jbell@uwo.ca","contact.domain":"uwo.ca"},{"date.published":"2009-09-02","date.changed":"2015-06-01","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/","author1":"John L.

His work had a vast range, encompassing \nanalysis, algebra, number theory, topology, differential geometry, \nspacetime theory, quantum mechanics, and the foundations of \nmathematics. His scientific writing is informed by a rare literary \nand artistic sensibility—in his words, “Expression and \nshape mean almost more to me than knowledge itself”. He was \nunusual among scientists and mathematicians of his time in being \nattracted to idealist philosophy: his idealist leanings can be seen \nparticularly in his work on the foundations of mathematics. In his \nyouth, Kant’s doctrines made a great impression on him; later he was \nstirred both by Fichte’s metaphysical idealism and by Husserlian \nphenomenology. Although Weyl came to question the certainties claimed\nby idealism, he cleaved always to the primacy of intuition he had \nfirst learned from Kant, and to its expression by Fichte as the \n“inner light” of individual consciousness.\n\n\n\nHermann Weyl was born on 9 November 1885 in the small town of \nElmshorn near Hamburg. In 1904 he entered Göttingen University, \nwhere his teachers included Hilbert, Klein and Minkowski. Weyl was \nparticularly impressed with Hilbert’s lectures on number theory and \nresolved to study everything he had written. Hilbert’s work on \nintegral equations became the focus of Weyl’s (1908) doctoral \ndissertation, written under Hilbert’s direction. In this and in \nsubsequent papers Weyl made important contributions to the theory of \nself-adjoint operators. Virtually all of Weyl’s many publications \nduring his stay in Göttingen until 1913 dealt with integral \nequations and their applications. \n\nAfter Weyl’s (1910b) habilitation, he became a Privatdozent and was \nthereby entitled to give lectures at the University of \nGöttingen. Weyl chose to lecture on Riemann’s theory of \nalgebraic functions during the winter semester of 1911–12. \nThese lectures became the basis of Weyl’s (1913) first book Die \nIdee der Riemannschen Fläche (The Concept of a Riemann \nSurface). This work, in which function theory, geometry and \ntopology are unified, constitutes the first modern and comprehensive \ntreatment of Riemann surfaces. The work also contains the first \nconstruction of an abstract manifold. Emphasizing that the `points of\nthe manifold’ can be quite arbitrary, Weyl based his definition of a \ngeneral two-dimensional manifold or surface on an extension of the \nneighbourhood axioms that Hilbert (1902) had proposed for the \ndefinition of a plane. The work is indicative of Weyl’s exceptional \ngift for harmoniously uniting into a coherent whole a patchwork of \ndistinct mathematical fields. \n\nIn 1913 Weyl was offered, and accepted, a professorship at the \nEidgenössische Technische Hochschule—ETH (Swiss Federal \nInstitute of Technology)—in Zürich. Weyl’s years in \nZürich were extraordinarily productive and resulted in some of \nhis finest work, especially in the foundations of mathematics and \nphysics. When he arrived in Zürich in the fall of 1913, Einstein\nand Grossmann were struggling to overcome a difficulty in their \neffort to provide a coherent mathematical formulation of the general \ntheory of relativity. Like Hilbert, Weyl appreciated the importance \nof a close relationship between mathematics and physics. It was \ntherefore only natural that Weyl should become interested in \nEinstein’s theory and the potential mathematical challenges it might \noffer. Following the outbreak of the First World War, however, in May\n1915 Weyl was called up for military service. But Weyl’s academic \ncareer was interrupted only briefly, since in 1916 he was exempted \nfrom military duties for reasons of health. In the meantime Einstein \nhad accepted an offer from Berlin and had left Zürich in 1914. \nEinstein’s departure had weakened the theoretical physics program at \nthe ETH and (as reported by Frei and Stammbach (1992, 26) the \nadministration hoped that Weyl’s presence would alleviate the \nsituation. But Weyl needed no external prompting to work in, and to \nteach, theoretical physics: his interest in the subject in general \nand, above all, in the theory of relativity, gave him more than \nsufficient motivation in that regard. Weyl decided to lecture on the \ngeneral theory of relativity in the summer semester of 1917, and \nthese lectures became the basis of his famous book \nRaum-Zeit-Materie (Space-Time-Matter) of 1918. \n\nDuring 1917–24, Weyl directed his energies equally to the \ndevelopment of the mathematical and philosophical foundations of \nrelativity theory, and to the broader foundations of mathematics. It \nis in these two areas that his philosophical erudition, nourished \nfrom his youth, manifests itself most clearly. The year 1918, the \nsame year in which Space-Time-Matter appeared, also saw the \npublication of Das Kontinuum (The Continuum), a \nwork in which Weyl constructs a new foundation for mathematical \nanalysis free of what he had come to see as fatal flaws in the \nset-theoretic formulation of Cantor and Dedekind. Soon afterwards \nWeyl embraced Brouwer’s mathematical intuitionism; in the early 1920s\nhe published a number of papers elaborating on and defending the \nintuitionistic standpoint in the foundations of mathematics. \n\nIt was also during the first years of the 1920s that Weyl came to \nappreciate the power and utility of group theory, initially in \nconnection with his work on the solution to the Riemann-Helmholtz-Lie\nproblem of space. Weyl analyzed this problem, the \nRaumproblem, in a series of articles and lectures during the\nperiod 1921–23. Weyl (1949b, 400) noted that his interest in \nthe philosophical foundations of the general theory of relativity had\nmotivated his analysis of the representations and invariants of the \ncontinuous groups: \n\nThis newly acquired appreciation of group theory led Weyl to what he \nhimself considered his greatest work in mathematics, a general theory\nof the representations and invariants of the classical Lie groups \n(Weyl 1924a, 1924f, 1925, 1926a, 1926b, 1926c). Later Weyl (1939) \nwrote a book, The Classical Groups: Their Invariants and \nRepresentations, in which he returned to the theory of \ninvariants and representations of semisimple Lie groups. In this work\nhe realized his ambition “to derive the decisive results for \nthe most important of these groups by direct algebraic construction, \nin particular for the full group of all non-singular linear \ntransformations and for the orthogonal group.” \n\nWeyl applied his work in group theory and his earlier work in \nanalysis and spectral theory to the new theory of quantum mechanics. \nWeyl’s mathematical analysis of the foundations of quantum mechanics \nshowed that regularities in a physical theory are most fruitfully \nunderstood in terms of symmetry groups. Weyl’s (1928) book \nGruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik (Group Theory and \nQuantum Mechanics) deals not only with the theory of quantum \nmechanics but also with relativistic quantum electrodynamics. In this\nwork Weyl also presented a very early analysis of discrete symmetries\nwhich later stimulated Dirac to predict the existence of the positron\nand the antiproton. \n\nDuring his years in Zürich Weyl received, and turned down, \nnumerous offers of professorships by other \nuniversities—including an invitation in 1923 to become Felix \nKlein’s successor at Göttingen. It was only in 1930 that he \nfinally accepted the call to become Hilbert’s successor there. His \nsecond stay in Göttingen was to be brief. Repelled by Nazism, \n“deeply revolted,” as he later wrote, “by the \nshame which this regime had brought to the German name,” he \nleft Germany in 1933 to accept an offer of permanent membership of \nthe newly founded Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Before \nhis departure for Princeton he published The Open World \n(1932); his tenure there saw the publication of Mind and \nNature (1934), the aforementioned The Classical Groups \n(1939), Algebraic Theory of Numbers (1940), Meromorphic \nFunctions and Analytic Curves (1943), Philosophy of \nMathematics and Natural Science (1949; an enlarged English \nversion of a 1927 work Philosophie der Mathematik und \nNaturwissenschaften), and Symmetry (1952). In 1951 he \nformally retired from the Institute, remaining as an emeritus member \nuntil his death, spending half his time there and half in \nZürich. He died in Zürich suddenly, of a heart attack, on 9\nDecember 1955. \n\nWeyl was first and foremost a mathematician, and certainly not a \n“professional” philosopher. But as a German intellectual \nof his time it was natural for him to regard philosophy as a pursuit \nto be taken seriously. In Weyl’s case, unusually even for a German \nmathematician, it was idealist philosophy that from the beginning \nplayed a significant role in his thought. Kant, Husserl, Fichte, and,\nlater, Leibniz, were at various stages major influences on Weyl’s \nphilosophical thinking. As a schoolboy Weyl had been impressed by \nKant’s “Critique of Pure Reason.” He was especially taken\nwith Kant’s doctrine that space and time are not inherent in the \nobjects of the world, existing as such and independently of our \nawareness, but are, rather, forms of our intuition As he reports in \nInsight and Reflection, (Weyl 1955), his youthful enthusiasm for Kant\ncrumbled soon after he entered Göttingen University in 1904. \nThere he read Hilbert’s Foundations of Geometry, a tour-de-force of \nthe axiomatic method, in comparison to which Kant’s “bondage to\nEuclidean geometry” now appeared to him naïve. After this \nphilosophical reverse he lapsed into an indifferent positivism for a \nwhile. But in 1912 he found a new and exciting source of \nphilosophical enlightenment in Husserl’s \n phenomenology.[1]\n It was also at about this time that Fichte’s metaphysical idealism \ncame to “capture his imagination.” Although Weyl later \nquestioned idealist philosophy, and became dissatisfied with \nphenomenology, he remained faithful throughout his life to the \nprimacy of intuition that he had first learned from Kant, and to the \nirreducibility of individual consciousness that had been confirmed in\nhis view by Fichte and Husserl. \n\nWeyl never provided a systematic account of his philosophical views,\nand sorting out his overall philosophical position is no easy matter.\nDespite the importance of intuition and individual consciousness in\nWeyl’s philosophical outlook, it would nevertheless be inexact to\ndescribe his outlook as being that of a “pure” idealist,\nsince certain “realist” touches seem also to be present,\nin his approach to physics, at least. His metaphysics appears to rest\non three elements, the first two of which may be considered\n“idealist”, and the third “realist”: these\nare, respectively, the Ego or “I”, the (Conscious) Other\nor “Thou”, and the external or “objective”\nworld.  \n\nIt is the first of these constituents, the Ego, to which Weyl \nascribes primacy. Indeed, in Weyl’s words, \n\nThe Ego alone has direct access to the given, that is, to the raw \nmaterials of the existent which are presented to consciousness with \nan immediacy at once inescapable and irreducible. The Ego is singular\nin that, from its own standpoint, it is unique. But in an act of \nself-reflection, through grasping (in Weyl’s words) “what I am \nfor myself”, the Ego comes to recognize that it has a \nfunction, namely as “conscious-existing carrier of the\nworld of phenomena.” It is then but a short step for the Ego to\ntranscend its singularity through the act of defining an \n“ego” to be an entity performing that same function \nfor itself. That is, an ego is precisely what I am for \nmyself (in other words, what the Ego is for itself)—again a \n“conscious-existing carrier of the world of \nphenomena”—and yet other than myself. \n“Thou” is the term the Ego uses to address, and so to \nidentify, an ego in this sense. “Thou” is thus the Ego \ngeneralized, the Ego refracted through itself. The Ego grasps that it\nexists within a world of Thous, that is, within a world of other Egos\nsimilar to itself. While the Ego has, of necessity, no direct access \nto any Thou, it can, through analogy and empathy, grasp what it is to\nbe Thou, a conscious being like oneself. By that very fact the Ego \nrecognizes in the Thou the same luminosity it sees in itself. \n\nThe relationship of the Ego with the external world, the realm of \n“objective” reality, is of an entirely different nature. \nThere is no analogy that the Ego can draw—as it can with the \nThou—between itself and the external world, since that world \n(presumably) lacks consciousness. The external world is radically \nother, and opaque to the \n Ego[2].\n Like Kant’s noumenal realm, the external world is outside the \nimmediacy of consciousness; it is, in a word, transcendent. \nSince this transcendent world is not directly accessible to the Ego, \nas far as the latter is concerned the existence of that world must \narise through postulation, “a matter of metaphysics, \nnot a judgment but an act of acknowledgment or \n belief.”[3]\n Indeed, according to Weyl, it is not strictly necessary for the Ego \nto postulate the existence of such a world, even given the existence \nof a world of Thous: \n\nFor as long as I do not proceed beyond what is given, or, more \nexactly, what is given at the moment, there is no need for the \nsubstructure of an objective world. Even if I include memory and in \nprinciple acknowledge it as valid testimony, if I furthermore accept \nas data the contents of the consciousness of others on equal terms \nwith my own, thus opening myself to the mystery of intersubjective \ncommunication, I would still not have to proceed as we actually do, \nbut might ask instead for the ‘transformations’ which \nmediate between the images of the several consciousnesses. Such a \npresentation would fit in with Leibniz’s monadology. (Weyl 1949, \n117.) \n\nBut once the existence of the transcendent world is postulated, its \nopacity to the Ego can be partly overcome by constructing a \nrepresentation of it through the use of symbols, the \nprocedure called by Weyl symbolic construction, (or \nconstructive \n cognition)[4]\n and which he regarded as the cornerstone of scientific explanation. \nHe outlines the process as follows (Weyl 1934, 53): \n\nWeyl’s procedure thus amounts to the following. In step 1, a given \nconfiguration is subjected to variation. One then identifies those \nfeatures of the configuration that remain unchanged under the \nvariation—the invariant features; these are in turn, \nthrough a process of reification, deemed to be properties of an \nunchanging substrate—the “things themselves”. It is\nprecisely the invariance of such features that renders them (as well \nas the “things themselves”) capable of being represented \nby the “time resisting” symbols Weyl introduces in step \n2. As (written) symbols these are communicable without temporal \ndistortion and can be subjected to unrestricted manipulation without \ndegradation. It is the flexibility conferred thereby which enables \nthe use of symbols to be conformable with reality. Nevertheless (step\n3) symbols are not haphazardly created in response to immediate \nstimuli; they are introduced, rather, in a structured, yet freely \nchosen manner which reflects the idea of an underlying \norder—the “one real world”—about which not \neverything is, or can be, known—it is, like the future, \n“open towards infinity”. Weyl observes that the \nreification implicit in the procedure of symbolic construction leads \ninevitably to its iteration, for “the transition from step to \nstep is made necessary by the fact that the objects at one step \nreveal themselves as manifestations of a higher reality, the reality \nof the next step” (Weyl (1934), 32–33). But in the end \n“systematic scientific explanation will finally reverse the \norder: first it will erect its symbolical world by itself, without \nany reference, then, skipping all intermediate steps, try to describe\nwhich symbolical configurations lead to which data of \nconsciousness” (ibid.). In this way the symbolic world\nbecomes (mistakenly) identified with the transcendent world. \n\nIt is symbolic construction which, in Weyl’s vision, allows us access\nto the “objective” world presumed to underpin our \nimmediate perceptions; indeed, Weyl holds that the objective world, \nbeing beyond the grasp (the “lighted circle”) of \nintuition, can only be presented to us in symbolic \n form[5].\n We can see a double dependence on the Ego in Weyl’s idea of symbolic \nconstruction to get hold of an objective world beyond the mental. For\nnot only is that world “constructed” by the Ego, but the \nmaterials of construction, the symbols themselves, as signs intended \nto convey meaning, have no independent existence beyond their \ngraspability by a consciousness. By their very nature these symbols \ncannot point directly to an external world (even given an unshakable \nbelief in the existence of that world) lying beyond consciousness. \nWeyl’s metaphysical triad thus reduces to what might be called a \npolarized dualism, with the mental (I, Thou) as the primary,\nindependent pole and objective reality as a secondary, dependent \n pole[6].\n  \n\n\nIn Weyl’s view mathematics simply lies – as it did for Brouwer\n– within the Ego’s “lighted circle of intuition” and\nso is, in principle at least, completely presentable to that\nintuition. But the nature of physics is more complicated. To the\nextent that physics is linked to the transcendent world of objective\nreality, it cannot arise as the direct object of intuition, but must,\nlike the transcendent world itself, be presented in symbolic form;\nmore exactly, as the result of a process of symbolic construction. It\nis this which, in Weyl’s vision, allows us access to to the\n\"objective\" world presumed to underpin our immediate perceptions.  \n\nWeyl’s conviction that the objective world can only be presented to us\nthrough symbolic construction may serve to explain his apparently\nuntroubled attitude towards the highly counterintuitive nature of\nquantum theory. Indeed, the claims of numerous physicists that the\nquantum microworld is accessible to us only through abstract\nmathematical description provides a vindication of Weyl’s thesis that\nobjective reality cannot be grasped directly, but only through the\nmediation of symbols.  In his later years Weyl attempted to enlarge his metaphysical triad \n(I, Thou, objective world) to a tetrad, by a process of completion, \nas it were, to embrace the “godhead that lives in impenetrable \nsilence”, the objective counterpart of the Ego, which had been \nsuggested to him by his study of Eckhart. But this effort was to remain\nuncompleted. \n\n\n\nDuring his long philosophical voyage Weyl stopped at a number of \nports of call: in his youth, Kantianism and positivism; then \nHusserlian phenomenological idealism; later Brouwerian intuitionism \nand finally a kind of theological existentialism. But apart from his \nbrief flirtation with positivism (itself, as he says, the result of a\ndisenchantment with Kant’s “bondage to Euclidean \ngeometry”), Weyl’s philosophical orientation remained in its \nessence idealist (even granting the significant realist elements \nmentioned above). Nevertheless, while he continued to acknowledge the\nimportance of phenomenology, his remarks in Insight and \nReflection indicate that he came to regard Husserl’s doctrine as\nlacking in two essential respects: first, it failed to give due \nrecognition to the (construction of) transcendent external world, \nwith which Weyl, in his capacity as a natural scientist, was \nconcerned; secondly, and perhaps in Weyl’s view even more seriously, \nit failed to engage with the enigma of selfhood: the fact that I am \nthe person I am. Grappling with the first problem led Weyl to \nidentify symbolic construction as providing sole access to objective \nreality, a position which brought him close to Cassirer in certain \nrespects; while the second problem seems to have led him to \nexistentialism and even, through his reading of Eckhart, to a kind of\nreligious mysticism. \n\nTowards the end of his Address on the Unity of Knowledge, \ndelivered at the 1954 Columbia University bicentennial celebrations, \nWeyl enumerates what he considers to be the essential constituents of\nknowledge. At the top of his \n list[7]\n comes \n\nIn particular Weyl held to the view that intuition, or \ninsight—rather than proof—furnishes the\nultimate foundation of mathematical knowledge. Thus in his \nDas Kontinuum of 1918 he says: \n\nWeyl’s idealism naturally inclined him to the view that the ultimate \nbasis of his own subject, mathematics, must be found in the \nintuitively given as opposed to the transcendent. Nevertheless, he \nrecognized that it would be unreasonable to require all mathematical \nknowledge to possess intuitive immediacy. In Das Kontinuum, \nfor example, he says: \n\nNevertheless, Weyl felt that this fact, inescapable as it might be, \ncould not justify extending the bounds of mathematics to embrace \nnotions, such as the actual infinite, which cannot be given fully in \nintuition even in principle. He held, rather, that such extensions of\nmathematics into the transcendent are warranted only by the fact that\nmathematics plays an indispensable role in the physical sciences, in \nwhich intuitive evidence is necessarily transcended. As he says in \nThe Open \n World[8]:\n  \n\nIn Consistency in Mathematics (1929), Weyl characterized the\nmathematical method as \n\nThe problem of identifying the limits on constructing “the \npossible” in this sense occupied Weyl a great deal. He was \nparticularly concerned with the concept of the mathematical \ninfinite, which he believed to elude \n“construction” in the naive set-theoretical sense \n [10].\n Again to quote a passage from Das Kontinuum: \n\nBut still, as Weyl attests towards the end of The Open \nWorld, “the demand for totality and the metaphysical \nbelief in reality inevitably compel the mind to represent the \ninfinite as closed being by symbolical construction”. The \nconception of the completed infinite, even if nonsensical, is \ninescapable. \n\nAnother mathematical “possible” to which Weyl gave a \ngreat deal of thought is the continuum. During the period \n1918–1921 he wrestled with the problem of providing the \nmathematical continuum—the real number line—with a \nlogically sound formulation. Weyl had become increasingly critical of\nthe principles underlying the set-theoretic construction of the \nmathematical continuum. He had come to believe that the whole \nset-theoretical approach involved vicious \n circles[11]\n to such an extent that, as he says, “every cell (so to speak) \nof this mighty organism is permeated by contradiction.” In \nDas Kontinuum he tries to overcome this by providing \nanalysis with a predicative formulation—not, as \nRussell and Whitehead had attempted, by introducing a hierarchy of \nlogically ramified types, which Weyl seems to have regarded as \nexcessively complicated—but rather by confining the \ncomprehension principle to formulas whose bound variables range over \njust the initial given entities (numbers). Accordingly he restricts \nanalysis to what can be done in terms of natural numbers with the aid\nof three basic logical operations, together with the operation of \nsubstitution and the process of “iteration”, i.e., \nprimitive recursion. Weyl recognized that the effect of this \nrestriction would be to render unprovable many of the central results\nof classical analysis—e.g., Dirichlet’s principle that any \nbounded set of real numbers has a least upper \n bound[12]—but\n he was prepared to accept this as part of the price that must be paid\nfor the security of mathematics. \n\nAs Weyl saw it, there is an unbridgeable gap between intuitively \ngiven continua (e.g. those of space, time and motion) on the one \nhand, and the “discrete” exact concepts of mathematics \n(e.g. that of natural \n number[13])\n on the other. The presence of this chasm meant that the construction \nof the mathematical continuum could not simply be “read \noff” from intuition. It followed, in Weyl’s view, that the \nmathematical continuum must be treated as if it were an element of \nthe transcendent realm, and so, in the end, justified in the same way\nas a physical theory. It was not enough that the mathematical theory \nbe consistent; it must also be reasonable.  \n\nDas Kontinuum embodies Weyl’s attempt at formulating a \ntheory of the continuum which satisfies the first, and, as far as \npossible, the second, of these requirements. In the following \npassages from this work he acknowledges the difficulty of the task: \n\n… the conceptual world of mathematics is so foreign to what \nthe intuitive continuum presents to us that the demand for \ncoincidence between the two must be dismissed as absurd. (Weyl 1987, \n108) \n\n… the continuity given to us immediately by intuition (in the \nflow of time and of motion) has yet to be grasped mathematically as a\ntotality of discrete “stages” in accordance with that \npart of its content which can be conceptualized in an exact way. \n(Ibid., \n 24)[14] \n\nExact time- or space-points are not the ultimate, underlying atomic \nelements of the duration or extension given to us in experience. On \nthe contrary, only reason, which thoroughly penetrates what is \nexperientially given, is able to grasp these exact ideas. And only in\nthe arithmetico- analytic concept of the real number belonging to the\npurely formal sphere do these ideas crystallize into full \ndefiniteness. (Ibid., 94) \n\nWhen our experience has turned into a real process in a real world \nand our phenomenal time has spread itself out over this world and \nassumed a cosmic dimension, we are not satisfied with replacing the \ncontinuum by the exact concept of the real number, in spite of the \nessential and undeniable inexactness arising from what is given. \n(Ibid., 93)  \n\nAs these quotations show, Weyl had come to accept that it was in \nprinciple impossible to furnish the continuum as presented to \nintuition with an exact mathematical formulation : so, with \nreluctance, he lowered his sights. In Das Kontinuum his goal\nwas, first and foremost, to establish the consistency of the\nmathematical theory of the continuum by putting the \narithmetical notion of real number on a firm logical basis. \nOnce this had been achieved, he would then proceed to show that this \ntheory is reasonable by employing it as the foundation for a\nplausible account of continuous process in the objective physical \n world.[15] \n\nIn §6 of Das Kontinuum Weyl presents his conclusions as\nto the relationship between the intuitive and mathematical \ncontinua. He poses the question: Does the mathematical \nframework he has erected provide an adequate representation of \nphysical or temporal continuity as it is actually \nexperienced? In posing this question we can see the continuing \ninfluence of Husserl and phenomenological doctrine. Weyl begins his \ninvestigation by noting that, according to his theory, if one asks \nwhether a given function is continuous, the answer is not fixed once \nand for all, but is, rather, dependent on the extent of the domain of\nreal numbers which have been defined up to the point at which the \nquestion is posed. Thus the continuity of a function must always \nremain provisional; the possibility always exists that a \nfunction deemed continuous now may, with the emergence of \n“new” real numbers, turn out to be discontinuous in \nthe future. \n [16] \n\nTo reveal the discrepancy between this formal account of continuity \nbased on real numbers and the properties of an intuitively given \ncontinuum, Weyl next considers the experience of seeing a pencil \nlying on a table before him throughout a certain time interval. The \nposition of the pencil during this interval may be taken as a \nfunction of the time, and Weyl takes it as a fact of observation that\nduring the time interval in question this function is continuous and \nthat its values fall within a definite range. And so, he says, \n\nTo drive the point home, Weyl focuses attention on the fundamental \ncontinuum of immediately given phenomenal time, that is, as \nhe characterizes it, \n\nIn order to correlate mathematical concepts with phenomenal time in \nthis sense Weyl grants the possibility of introducing a rigidly \npunctate “now” and of identifying and exhibiting the \nresulting temporal points. On the collection of these temporal points\nis defined the relation of earlier than as well as a \ncongruence relation of equality of temporal intervals, the \nbasic constituents of a simple mathematical theory of time. Now Weyl \nobserves that the discrepancy between phenomenal time and the concept\nof real number would vanish if the following pair of conditions could\nbe shown to be satisfied: \n\ncan be constructed arithmetically in pure number theory on the basis \nof our principles of definition, and is therefore a real number in \nour sense. (Ibid., 89) \n\nCondition 2 means that, if we take the time span \\(OE\\) as a \nunit, then each temporal point \\(P\\) is correlated with a \ndefinite real number. In an addendum Weyl also stipulates the \nconverse. \n\nBut can temporal intuition itself provide evidence for the truth or \nfalsity of these two conditions? Weyl thinks not. In fact, he states \nquite categorically that \n\nThe grounds for this assertion are by no means immediately evident, \nbut one gathers from the passages following it that Weyl regards the \nexperienced continuous flow of phenomenal time as \nconstituting an insuperable barrier to the whole enterprise of \nrepresenting the continuum as experienced in terms of individual \npoints, and even to the characterization of “individual \ntemporal point” itself. As he says, \n\nWeyl sums up what he thinks can be affirmed about “objectively \npresented time”—by which he presumably means \n“phenomenal time described in an objective \nmanner”—in the following two assertions, which he claims \napply equally, mutatis mutandis, to every intuitively given \ncontinuum, in particular, to the continuum of spatial extension. \n(Ibid., 92): \n\nThe fact that single points in a true continuum “cannot be \nexhibited” arises, Weyl asserts, from the fact that they are \nnot genuine individuals and so cannot be characterized by their \nproperties. In the physical world they are never defined absolutely, \nbut only in terms of a coordinate system, which, in an arresting \nmetaphor, Weyl describes as “the unavoidable residue of the \neradication of the ego.” This metaphor, which Weyl was to \nemploy more than \n once[17],\n again reflects the continuing influence of phenomenological doctrine \nin his thinking : here, the thesis that the existent is given in the \nfirst instance as the contents of a consciousness. \n\nBy 1919 Weyl had come to embrace Brouwer’s views on the intuitive \ncontinuum. Given the idealism that always animated Weyl’s thought, \nthis is not surprising, since Brouwer assigned the thinking subject a\ncentral position in the creation of the mathematical \n world[18].\n  \n\nIn his early thinking Brouwer had held that that the continuum is \npresented to intuition as a whole, and that it is impossible to \nconstruct all its points as individuals. But later he radically \ntransformed the concept of “point”, endowing points with \nsufficient fluidity to enable them to serve as generators of a \n“true” continuum. This fluidity was achieved by admitting\nas “points”, not only fully defined discrete numbers such\nas 1/9, \\(e\\), and the like—which have, so to speak, \nalready achieved “being”—but also \n“numbers” which are in a perpetual state of \n“becoming” in that the entries in their decimal (or \ndyadic) expansions are the result of free acts of choice by a subject\noperating throughout an indefinitely extended time. The resulting \nchoice sequences cannot be conceived as finished, completed objects: \nat any moment only an initial segment is known. Thus Brouwer obtained\nthe mathematical continuum in a manner compatible with his belief in \nthe primordial intuition of time—that is, as an unfinished, in \nfact unfinishable entity in a perpetual state of growth, a \n“medium of free development”. In Brouwer’s vision, the \nmathematical continuum is indeed “constructed”, not, \nhowever, by initially shattering, as did Cantor and Dedekind, an \nintuitive continuum into isolated points, but rather by assembling it\nfrom a complex of continually changing overlapping parts. \n\nBrouwer’s impact looms large in Weyl’s 1921 paper, On the New \nFoundational Crisis of Mathematics. Here Weyl identifies two distinct\nviews of the continuum: “atomistic” or \n“discrete”; and “continuous”. In the first of\nthese the continuum is composed of individual real numbers which are \nwell-defined and can be sharply distinguished. Weyl describes his \nearlier attempt at reconstructing analysis in Das Kontinuum as \natomistic in this sense: \n\nBy this time Weyl had repudiated atomistic theories of the continuum,\nincluding that of Das \n Kontinuum.[19]\n While intuitive considerations, together with Brouwer’s influence, \nmust certainly have fuelled Weyl’s rejection of such theories, it \nalso had a logical basis. For Weyl had come to regard as meaningless \nthe formal procedure—employed in Das Kontinuum—of \nnegating universal and existential statements concerning real numbers\nconceived as developing sequences or as sets of rationals. This had \nthe effect of undermining the whole basis on which his theory had \nbeen erected, and at the same time rendered impossible the very \nformulation of a “law of excluded middle” for such \nstatements. Thus Weyl found himself espousing a \n position[20]\n considerably more radical than that of Brouwer, for whom negations of\nquantified statements had a perfectly clear constructive meaning, \nunder which the law of excluded middle is simply not generally \naffirmable. \n\nOf existential statements Weyl says: \n\nWeyl termed such pseudostatements “judgment abstracts”, \nlikening them, with typical literary flair, to “a piece of \npaper which announces the presence of a treasure, without divulging \nits location.” Universal statements, although possessing \ngreater substance than existential ones, are still mere intimations \nof judgments, “judgment instructions”, for which Weyl \nprovides the following metaphorical description: \n\nAbove and beyond the claims of logic, Weyl welcomed Brouwer’s \nconstruction of the continuum by means of sequences generated by free\nacts of choice, thus identifying it as a “medium of free \nBecoming” which “does not dissolve into a set of real \nnumbers as finished entities”. Weyl felt that Brouwer, through \nhis doctrine of \n Intuitionism[21],\n had come closer than anyone else to bridging that “unbridgeable\nchasm” between the intuitive and mathematical continua. In \nparticular, he found compelling the fact that the Brouwerian \ncontinuum is not the union of two disjoint nonempty parts—that \nit is, in a word, indecomposable. “A genuine continuum,” \nWeyl says, “cannot be divided into separate \n fragments.”[22]\n In later publications he expresses this more colourfully by quoting \nAnaxagoras to the effect that a continuum “defies the chopping \noff of its parts with a hatchet.” \n\nWeyl also agreed with Brouwer that all functions everywhere defined \non a continuum are continuous, but here certain subtle differences of\nviewpoint emerge. Weyl contends that what mathematicians had taken to\nbe discontinuous functions actually consist of several continuous \nfunctions defined on separated continua. In Weyl’s view, for example, \nthe “discontinuous” function defined by \n\\(f(x) = 0\\) for \\(x \\lt 0\\) and \n\\(f(x) = 1\\) for \\(x \\ge 0\\) in fact consists of \nthe two functions with constant values and 1 respectively \ndefined on the separated continua \\(\\{x: x \\lt 0\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{x: x \\ge 0\\}\\). (The union of these two continua \nfails to be the whole of the real continuum because of the failure of\nthe law of excluded middle: it is not the case that, for be any real \nnumber \\(x\\), either \\(x \\lt 0\\) or \\(x \\ge 0\\).) \nBrouwer, on the other hand, had not dismissed the possibility that \ndiscontinuous functions could be defined on proper parts of a \ncontinuum, and still seems to have been searching for an appropriate \nway of formulating this \n idea.[23]\n In particular, at that time Brouwer would probably have been inclined\nto regard the above function \\(f\\) as a genuinely discontinuous \nfunction defined on a proper part of the real continuum. For Weyl, it\nseems to have been a self-evident fact that all functions defined on \na continuum are continuous, but this is because Weyl confines \nattention to functions which turn out to be continuous by definition.\nBrouwer’s concept of function is less restrictive than Weyl’s and it \nis by no means immediately evident that such functions must always be\ncontinuous.  \n\nWeyl defined real functions as mappings correlating each interval in \nthe choice sequence determining the argument with an interval in the \nchoice sequence determining the value “interval by \ninterval” as it were, the idea being that approximations to the\ninput of the function should lead effectively to corresponding \napproximations to the input. Such functions are continuous by \ndefinition. Brouwer, in contrast, considers real functions as \ncorrelating choice sequences with choice sequences, and the \ncontinuity of these is by no means obvious. The fact that Weyl \nrefused to grant (free) choice sequences—whose identity is in \nno way predetermined—sufficient individuality to admit them as \narguments of functions betokens a commitment to the conception of the\ncontinuum as a “medium of free Becoming” even deeper, \nperhaps, than that of Brouwer. \n\nThere thus being only minor differences between Weyl’s and Brouwer’s \naccounts of the continuum, Weyl accordingly abandoned his earlier \nattempt at the reconstruction of analysis, and joined Brouwer. He \nexplains: \n\nWeyl’s initial enthusiasm for intuitionism seems later to have waned.\nThis may have been due to a growing belief on his part that the \nmathematical sacrifices demanded by adherence to intuitionistic \ndoctrine (e.g., the abandonment of the least upper bound principle, \nand other important results of classical analysis) would prove to be \nintolerable to practicing mathematicians. Witness this passage from \nPhilosophy of Mathematics and Natural Science: \n\nNevertheless, it is likely that Weyl remained convinced to the end of\nhis days that intuitionism, despite its technical \n“awkwardness”, came closest, of all mathematical \napproaches, to capturing the essence of the continuum. \n\nWeyl’s espousal of the intuitionistic standpoint in the foundations \nof mathematics in 1920–21 inevitably led to friction with his \nold mentor Hilbert. Hilbert’s conviction had long been that there \nwere in principle no limitations on the possibility of a full \nscientific understanding of the natural world, and, analogously, in \nthe case of mathematics, that once a problem was posed with the \nrequired precision, it was, at least in principle, soluble. In 1904 \nhe was moved to respond to Emil du Bois-Reymond’s famous declaration \nconcerning the limits of science, ignoramus et ignorabimus (“we\nare ignorant and we shall remain ignorant”): \n\nHilbert was unalterably opposed to any restriction of mathematics \n“by decree”, an obstacle he had come up against in the \nearly stages of his career in the form of Leopold Kronecker’s (the \ninfluential 19th century German mathematician) \nanathematization of all mathematics venturing beyond the finite. In \nBrouwer’s intuitionistic program—with its draconian \nrestrictions on what was admissible in mathematical argument, in \nparticular, its rejection of the law of excluded middle, \n“pure” existence proofs, and virtually the whole of \nCantorian set theory—Hilbert saw the return of Kroneckerian \nconstaints on mathematics (and also, perhaps, a trace of du \nBois-Reymond’s “ignorabimus”) against which he had \nstruggled for so long. Small wonder, then, that Hilbert was upset \nwhen Weyl joined the Brouwerian \n camp.[25] \n\nHilbert’s response was to develop an entirely new approach to the \nfoundations of mathematics with the ultimate goal of establishing \nbeyond doubt the consistency of the whole of classical mathematics, \nincluding arithmetic, analysis, and Cantorian set theory. With the \nattainment of that goal, classical mathematics would be placed \nsecurely beyond the destructive reach of the intuitionists. The core \nof Hilbert’s program was the translation of the whole apparatus of \nclassical mathematical demonstration into a simple, finitistic \nframework (which he called “metamathematics”) involving \nnothing more, in principle, than the straightforward manipulation of \nsymbols, taken in a purely formal sense, and devoid of further \n meaning.[26]\n Within metamathematics itself, Hilbert imposed a standard of \ndemonstrative evidence stricter even than that demanded by the \nintuitionists, a form of finitism rivalling (ironically) that of \nKronecker. The demonstration of the consistency of classical \nmathematics was then to be achieved by showing, within the \nconstraints of strict finitistic evidence insisted on by Hilbert, \nthat the formal metamathematical counterpart of a classical proof in \nthat system can never lead to an assertion evidently false, such as \n\\(0 = 1\\). \n\nHilbert’s program rested on the insight that, au fond, the \nonly part of mathematics whose reliability is entirely beyond \nquestion is the finitistic, or concrete part: in \nparticular, finite manipulation of surveyable domains of distinct \nobjects including mathematical symbols presented as marks on paper. \nMathematical propositions referring only to concrete objects in this \nsense Hilbert called real, concrete, or \ncontentual propositions, and all other mathematical \npropositions he distinguished as possessing an ideal, or \nabstract character. (Thus, for example, \\(2 + 2 = 4\\) would \ncount as a real proposition, while there exists an odd perfect \nnumber would count as an ideal one.) Hilbert viewed ideal \npropositions as akin to the ideal lines and points “at \ninfinity” of projective geometry. Just as the use of these does\nnot violate any truths of the “concrete” geometry of the \nusual Cartesian plane, so he hoped to show that the use of ideal \npropositions—even those of Cantorian set theory—would \nnever lead to falsehoods among the real propositions, that, in other \nwords, such use would never contradict any self-evident fact \nabout concrete objects. Establishing this by strictly concrete, \nand so unimpeachable means was thus the central aim of Hilbert’s \nprogram. Hilbert may be seen to have followed Kant in attempting to \nground mathematics on the apprehension of spatiotemporal \nconfigurations; but Hilbert restricted these configurations to \nconcrete signs (such as inscriptions on paper). Hilbert regarded \nconsistency as the touchstone of existence, and so for him the \nimportant thing was the fact that no inconsistencies can arise within\nthe realm of concrete signs, since correct descriptions of concrete \nobjects are always mutually compatible. In particular, within the \nrealm of concrete signs, actual infinity cannot generate \ninconsistencies since, again along with Kant, he held that this \nconcept cannot correspond to any concrete object. Hilbert’s view \nseems accordingly to have been that the formal soundness of \nmathematics issues ultimately, not from a logical source, \nbut from a concrete \n one[27],\n in much the same way as the consistency of truly reported empirical \nstatements is guaranteed by the concreteness of the external \n world[28].\n  \n\nWeyl soon grasped the significance of Hilbert’s program, and came to \nacknowledge its “immense significance and \n scope”[29].\n Whether that program could be successfully carried out was, of \ncourse, still an open question. But independently of this issue Weyl \nwas concerned about what he saw as the loss of content resulting from\nHilbert’s thoroughgoing formalization of mathematics. “Without \ndoubt,” Weyl warns, “if mathematics is to remain a \nserious cultural concern, then some sense must be attached \nto Hilbert’s game of formulae.” Weyl thought that this sense \ncould only be supplied by “fusing” mathematics and \nphysics so that “the mathematical concepts of number, function,\netc. (or Hilbert’s symbols) generally partake in the theoretical \nconstruction of reality in the same way as the concepts of energy, \ngravitation, electron, \n etc.”[30]\n Indeed, in Weyl’s view, “it is the function of mathematics to \nbe at the service of the natural sciences”. But still: \n\nWeyl points out that, just as in theoretical physics, Hilbert’s \naccount of mathematics “already… goes beyond the bounds \nof intuitively ascertainable states of affairs through… ideal \nassumptions.” (Weyl 1927, 484.) If Hilbert’s realm of \ncontentual or “real” propositions—the domain of \nmetamathematics—corresponds to that part of the world directly \naccessible to what Weyl terms “insight” or \n“phenomenal knowledge”, then “serious” \nmathematics—the mathematics that practicing mathematicians are \nactually engaged in doing—corresponds to Hilbert’s realm of \n“ideal” propositions. Weyl regarded this realm as the \ncounterpart of the domain generated by “symbolic \nconstruction”, the transcendent world focussed on by \ntheoretical physics. Hence his memorable characterization: \n\nIn Weyl’s eyes, Hilbert’s approach embodied the “symbolic \nrepresentation of the transcendent, which demands to be \nsatisfied”, and so he regarded its emergence as a natural \ndevelopment. But by 1927 Weyl saw Hilbert’s doctrine as beginning to \nprevail over intuitionism, and in this an adumbration of “a\ndecisive defeat of the philosophical attitude of pure \nphenomenology, which thus proves to be insufficient for the \nunderstanding of creative science even in the area of cognition that \nis most primal and most readily open to \n evidence—mathematics.”[31]\n Since by this time Weyl had become convinced that “creative \nscience” must necessarily transcend what is \nphenomenologically given, he had presumably already accepted that \npure phenomenology is incapable of accounting for theoretical \nphysics, let alone the whole of existence. But it must have been \npainful for him to concede the analogous claim in the case of \nmathematics. In 1932, he asserts: “If mathematics is \ntaken by itself, one should restrict oneself with Brouwer to the \nintuitively cognizable truths … nothing compels us to go \nfarther.” If mathematics could be “taken by \nitself”, then there would be no need for it to justify its \npractices by resorting to “symbolic construction”, to \nemploy symbols which in themselves “signify \nnothing”—nothing, at least, accessible to intuition. But,\nunlike Brouwer, Weyl seems finally to have come to terms with the \nidea that mathematics could not simply be “taken by \nitself”, that it has a larger role to play in the world beyond \nits service as a paradigm, however pure, of subjective certainty. \n\nThe later impact of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems on Hilbert’s\nprogram led Weyl to remark in \n 1949:[32] \n\nThe fact that “Gödel has left us little hope that a \nformalism wide enough to encompass classical mathematics will be \nsupported by a proof of consistency” seems to have led Weyl to \ntake a renewed interest in “axiomatic systems developed before \nHilbert without such ambitious dreams”, for example Zermelo’s \nset theory, Russell’s and Whitehead’s ramified type theory and \nHilbert’s own axiom systems for geometry (as well, possibly, as \nWeyl’s own system in Das Kontinuum, which he modestly fails \nto mention). In one of his last papers, Axiomatic Versus \nConstructive Procedures in Mathematics, written sometime after \n1953, he saw the battle between Hilbertian formalism and Brouwerian \nintuitionism in which he had participated in the 1920s as having \ngiven way to a “dextrous blending” of the axiomatic \napproach to mathematics championed by Bourbaki and the algebraists \n(themselves mathematical descendants of Hilbert) with constructive \nprocedures associated with geometry and topology. \n\nIt seems appropriate to conclude this account of Weyl’s work in the \nfoundations and philosophy of mathematics by allowing the man himself\nto have the last word: \n\nWeyl’s clarification of the role of coordinates, invariance or \nsymmetry principles, his important concept of gauge invariance, his \ngroup-theoretic results concerning the uniqueness of the Pythagorean \nform of the metric, his generalization of Levi-Civita’s concept of \nparallelism, his development of the geometry of paths, his discovery \nof the causal-inertial method which prepared the way to empirically \ndetermine the spacetime metric in a non-circular, non-conventional \nmanner, his deep analysis of the concept of motion and the role of \nMach’s Principle, are but a few examples of his important \ncontributions to the philosophical and mathematical foundations of \nmodern spacetime theory.  \n\nWeyl’s book, Raum-Zeit-Materie, beautifully exemplifies the \nfruitful and harmonious interplay of mathematics, physics and \nphilosophy. Here Weyl aims at a mathematical and philosophical \nelucidation of the problem of space and time in general. In the \npreface to the great classical work of 1923, the fifth German \nedition, after mentioning the importance of mathematics to his work, \nWeyl says:  \n\nExtending and abstracting from Gauss’s treatment of curved surfaces \nin Euclidian space, Riemann constructed an infinitesimal geometry of \n\\(n\\)-dimensional manifolds. The coordinate assignments \n\\(x^{k}(p)\\ [k \\in \\{1, \\ldots ,n\\}\\)] of the points \\(p\\) in such an \\(n\\)-dimensional \nRiemannian manifold are quite arbitrary, subject only to the \nrequirement of arbitrary differential coordinate \n transformations.[33]\n Riemann’s assumption that in an infinitesimal neighbourhood of a \npoint, Euclidean geometry and hence Pythagoras’s theorem holds, finds\nits formal expression in Riemann’s equation  \n\nfor the square of the length \\(ds\\) of an infinitesimal line \nelement that leads from the point \\(p = x(p) = \n(x^{1}(p), \\ldots ,x^{n}(p))\\) to an arbitrary infinitely \nnear point \\(p' = x(p') = (x^{1}(p) + dx^{1}(p), \\ldots ,x^{n}(p) + dx^{n}(p))\\).  \n\nThe assumption that Euclidean geometry holds in the infinitesimally \nsmall means that the \\(dx^{i}(p)\\) \ntransform linearly under arbitrary coordinate \ntransformations. Using the Einstein summation \n convention[34],\n equation (1) can simply be written as  \n\nRiemann assumed the validity of the Pythagorean metric only in the \ninfinitely small. Riemannian geometry is essentially a geometry of \ninfinitely near points and conforms to the requirement that all laws \nare to be formulated as field laws. Field laws are \nclose-action-laws which relate the field magnitudes only to \ninfinitesimally neighbouring points in \n space.[35]\n The value of some field magnitude at each point depends only on the \nvalues of other field magnitudes in the infinitesimal neighbourhoods \nof the corresponding points. The field magnitudes consist of partial \nderivatives of position functions at some point, and this requires \nthe knowledge of the behavior of the position functions only with \nrespect to the neighbourhood of that point. To construct a field law,\nonly the behavior of the world in the infinitesimally small is \n required.[36] \n\nRiemann’s ideas were brought to a concrete realization fifty years \nlater in Einstein’s general theory of relativity. The basic idea \nunderlying the general theory of relativity was Einstein’s \nrecognition that the metric field, which has such powerful real \neffects on matter, cannot be a rigid once and for all given geometric\nstructure of the spacetime, but must itself be something real, that \nnot only has effects on matter, but is in turn also affected by \nmatter. Riemann had already suggested that analogous to the \nelectromagnetic field, the metric field reciprocally interacts with \nmatter. Einstein came to this idea of reciprocity between matter and \nfield independently of Riemann, and in the context of his theory of \ngeneral relativity, applied this principle of reciprocity to four \ndimensional spacetime. Thus Einstein could adopt Riemann’s \ninfinitesimal geometry with the important difference: given the \ncausal requirements of Einstein’s theory of special relativity, \nRiemann’s quadratic form is not positive definite but indefinite; it \nhas signature \n 1.[37]\n Weyl (1922a) says:  \n\nAnd in another place Weyl (1918b) remarks:  \n\nAfter Einstein applied Riemannian geometry to his theory of general \nrelativity, Riemannian geometry became the focus of intense research.\nIn particular, G. Ricci and T. Levi-Civita’s so-called Absolute \nDifferential Calculus developed and clarified the Riemannian \nnotions of an affine connection and covariant \ndifferentiation. The decisive step in this development, however,\nwas T. Levi-Civita’s discovery in 1917 of the concept of \ninfinitesimal parallel vector displacement, and the\nfact that such parallel vector displacement is uniquely determined by\nthe metric field of Riemannian geometry. Levi-Civita’s construction \nof infinitesimal parallel transport on a manifold required the \nprocess of embedding the manifold into a flat higher-dimensional \nmetric space. In 1918, Weyl generalized Levi-Civita’s concept of \nparallel transport by means of an intrinsic construction \nthat does not require the process of such an embedding, and is \ntherefore independent of a metric. Weyl’s intrinsic construction \nresults in a metric-independent, symmetric linear \nconnection. Weyl simply referred to the latter as \naffine \n connection.[38] \n\nWeyl defines what he means by an affine connection in the \nfollowing way: A point \\(p\\) on the manifold \\(M\\) is affinely \nconnected with its immediate neighborhood, if and only of for every \ntangent vector \\(v_{p}\\) at \\(p\\), a tangent \nvector \\(v_{q}\\) at \\(q\\) is determined to which\nthe tangent vector \\(v_{p}\\) gives rise under \nparallel displacement from \\(p\\) to the infinitesimally \nneighboring point \\(q\\). This definition merely says that a \nmanifold is affinely connected if it admits the process of \ninfinitesimal parallel displacement of a vector.  \n\nWeyl’s next definition characterizes the essential nature of\ninfinitesimal parallel displacement. The definition says that at any \narbitrary point of the manifold there exists a geodesic \ncoordinate system such that the components of any vector at that\npoint are not altered by an infinitesimal parallel displacement with \nrespect to it. This is a geometrical way of expressing Einstein’s \nrequirement that the gravitational field can always be made to vanish\nlocally. According to Weyl (1923b, 115), it characterizes the \nnature of an affine connection on the manifold. A manifold \nwhich is an affine manifold is homogeneous in this sense. Moreover, \nmanifolds do not exist whose affine structure is of a different \nnature.  \n\nThe transport of a tangent vector \\(v_{p}\\) at \n\\(p\\) to an infinitesimally nearby point \\(q\\) results in the \ntangent vector \\(v_{q}\\) at \\(q\\), namely,  \n\nThis infinitesimal tangent vector transport Weyl defines as \ninfinitesimal parallel displacement if and only if there \nexists a coordinate system \\(\\overline{x}\\), called a geodesic coordinate system\nfor the neighborhood of \\(p\\), relative to which the transported \ntangent vector \\(\\overline{v}_{q}\\) at \\(q\\) \npossesses the same components as the original tangent vector \\(\\overline{v}_{p}\\) at \\(p\\); that is,  Figure 1: Parallel transport in a geodesic coordinate system \\(\\overline{x}\\) \n\nFor an arbitrary coordinate system \\(x\\) the components \\(dv^{\\,i}_p\\)\nvanish whenever \\(v^{\\,i}_p\\) or \\(dx^{\\,i}_p\\) vanish. Consequently,\n\\(dv^{\\,i}_p\\) is bi-linear in \\(v^{\\,i}_p\\) and\n\\(dx^{\\,i}_p\\); that is,  \n\nwhere, in the case of four dimensions, the \\(4^{3} = 64\\)\ncoefficients \\(\\Gamma^{\\,i}_{jk} (x^{i}(p))\\)\nare coordinate functions, that is, functions of \n\\(x^{i}(p)\\) \\((i = 1, \\ldots, 4)\\), \nand the minus sign is introduced to agree with convention.  Figure 2: Parallel transport in an arbitrary coordinate system \\(x\\) \n\nIt is important to understand that there is no intrinsic notion of \ninfinitesimal parallel displacement on a differentiable manifold. A \nnotion of “parallelism” is not something that a manifold \nwould possess merely by virtue of being a smooth manifold; additional\nstructure has to be introduced which resides on the manifold and \nwhich permits the notion of infinitesimal parallelism. A manifold is \nan “affine manifold” \\((M, \\Gamma)\\) if in addition to its \nmanifold structure (differential topological structure) it is also \nendowed with an affine structure \\(\\Gamma\\) that assigns to each of its \npoints 64 coefficients \\(\\Gamma^{i}_{jk} (x^{i}(p))\\)\nsatisfying the symmetry condition \\(\\Gamma^{i}_{jk} (x^{i}(p))\n= \\Gamma^{i}_{kj} (x^{i}(p))\\).\n \n\nAn \\(n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\), which is an affinely \nconnected manifold, Weyl (1918b) interprets physically as an \n\\(n\\)-dimensional world (spacetime) filled with a gravitational \nfield. Weyl says, “…the affine connection appears in \nphysics as the gravitational field…” Since \nthere exists at each spacetime point a geodesic coordinate system in \nwhich the components \\(\\Gamma^{i}_{jk}\\) of the symmetric linear \nconnection vanish, the gravitational field can be made to vanish at \neach point of the manifold.  \n\nThe classical theory of physical geometry, developed by \nHelmholtz, Poincaré and Hilbert, regarded the concept of \n“metric congruence” as the only basic relation of \ngeometry, and constructed physical geometry from this one notion \nalone in terms of the relative positions and displacements of \nphysical congruence standards. Although Einstein’s general theory of \nrelativity championed a dynamical view of spacetime \ngeometry that is very different from the classical theory of\nphysical geometry, Einstein initially approached the problem of \nthe structure of spacetime from the metrical point of view. It was \nWeyl (1923b) who emphasized and developed the metric-independent \nconstruction of the symmetric linear connection and who pointed out \nthe rationale for doing so. In both the non-relativistic and \nrelativistic contexts, it is the symmetric linear connection, and not\nthe metric, which plays the essential role in the formulation of all \nphysical laws that are expressed in terms of differential equations. \nIt is the symmetric linear connection that relates the state of a \nsystem at a spacetime point to the states at neighboring spacetime \nevents and enters into the differentials of the corresponding \nmagnitudes. In both Newtonian physics and the theory of general \nrelativity, all dynamical laws presuppose the projective and affine \nstructure and hence the Law of Inertia. In fact, the whole of tensor \nanalysis with its covariant derivatives is based on the affine \nconcept of infinitesimal parallel displacement and not \non the metric.  \n\nWeyl’s metric independent construction not only led to a deeper \nunderstanding of the mathematical characterization of gravity, it \nalso prepared the way for new constructions and generalizations in \ndifferential geometry and the general theory of relativity. In \nparticular, it led to  \n\nFor more detail on Weyl’s metric independent construction of the \naffine connection (linear symmetric connection), see \n the supplement.\n  \n\nWeyl’s metric-independent construction of the affine structure led to\nthe development of differential projective geometries or the\ngeometries of paths. The interest in projective geometry is \nin the paths, that is, in the continuous set of points of \nthe image set of curves, rather than in the possible \nparameter descriptions of curves. A curve has one degree of freedom; \nit depends on one parameter, and its image set or path is a \none-dimensional continuous set of points of the manifold. One \nrepresents a curve on a manifold \\(M\\) as a smooth map \n(i.e., \\(C^{\\infty})\\) \\(\\gamma\\) from some open interval \n\\(I = (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon)\\) of the real line \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) into\n\\(M\\).  Figure 3:\nA curve on the manifold \\(M\\) is the smooth map \n\\(\\gamma : I \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow M\\) \n\nIt is important to understand that what one means by a \n“curve” is the map (the parametric description) itself, \nand not the set of its image points, the path. Consequently,\ntwo curves are mathematically considered to be different curves if \nthey are given by different maps (different parameter descriptions), \neven if their image set, that is, their path, is the \nsame. If we change a curve’s parameter description we change the\ncurve but not its image set (its path), the points it passes through.\nA path is therefore sometimes defined as an equivalence class of \ncurves under arbitrary parameter transformations. Hence, projective \ngeometry may be defined as an equivalence class of affine geometries.\n \n\nA geodesic curve in flat space is a straight line. Its \ntangent at one point is parallel to the tangent at previous or \nsubsequent points. A straight line in Euclidean space is the only \ncurve that parallel-transports its own tangent vector. This notion of\nparallel transport of the tangent vector also characterizes geodesic \ncurves in curved space. That is, a curve \\(\\gamma\\) in curved \nspace, which parallel-transports its own tangent vector along all of \nits points, is called a geodesic curve. Given a manifold \nwith an affine structure and some arbitrary local coordinate system, \nthe coordinate functions (components) \\(\\gamma^{i}\\) of a\ngeodesic curve \\(\\gamma\\) satisfy the second-order non-linear \ndifferential equations  \n\nOne may characterize the projective geometry \\(\\Pi\\) on an \naffine manifold either in terms of an equivalence class of geodesic \ncurves under arbitrary parameter \n diffeomorphisms[39],\n thereby eliminating all the parameter descriptions and hence all \npossible notions of distance along the curves satisfying \n (6),[40]\n or one may take the process of autoparallelism of directions \nas fundamental in defining a projective structure.  Figure 4: \nA path \\(\\xi\\) is an equivalence class [\\(\\gamma\\)] of curves \nunder all parameter diffeomorphisms \\(\\mu: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R};\n\\lambda \\mapsto \\mu(\\lambda)\\) \n\nWeyl took the latter approach. According to Weyl, the infinitesimal \nprocess of parallel displacements of vectors contains, as a special \ncase, the infinitesimal displacement of a direction into its\nown direction. Such an infinitesimal autoparallelism of \ndirections is characteristic of the projective structure of \nan affinely connected manifold.  \nInfinitesimal Autoparallelism of a Direction:\nAn infinitesimal autoparallelism of a direction \\(R\\) at an\narbitrary point \\(p\\) consists in the parallel displacement of \\(R\\)\nat \\(p\\) to a neighbouring point \\(p'\\) which lies in the direction\n\\(R\\) at \\(p\\). \n\nA curve is geodesic if and only if its tangent direction\n\\(R\\) experiences infinitesimal autoparallelism when moved \nalong all the points of the curve. This characterization of a \ngeodesic curve constitutes an abstraction from affine geometry. \nThrough this abstraction, a geodesic curve is definable exclusively \nin terms of autoparallelism of tangent directions, and not \ntangent vectors. Roughly speaking, an affine geometry is \nessentially a projective geometry with the notion of distance defined\nalong the curves. By eliminating all possible notions of distance \nalong curves, or equivalently, all the parameter descriptions of the \ncurves, one abstracts the projective geometry form affine geometry.  \n\nAs mentioned above, a projective geometry \\(\\Pi\\) may be defined as an \nequivalence class of affine geometries, that is, an equivalence class\nof projectively related affine connections [\\(\\Gamma\\)]. Weyl \npresented the details of his approach to projective geometry, which \nuses the notion of autoparallelism of direction, in a set of\nlectures delivered in Barcelona and Madrid in the spring of 1922 \n(Weyl (1923a); see also Weyl (1921c)). Weyl began with the following \nnecessary and sufficient condition for the invariance of the \nprojective structure \\(\\Pi\\) under a transformation \n\\(\\Gamma \\rightarrow \\overline{\\Gamma}\\) of the affine \nstructure:  \nProjective Transformation: \nA transformation \\(\\Gamma \\rightarrow \\overline{\\Gamma}\\)\npreserves the projective structure \\(\\Pi\\) of a \nmanifold with an affine structure \\(\\Gamma\\), and is called a \nprojective transformation, if and only if where \\(v^{\\,i}\\) is an arbitrary vector. \n\nWeyl’s definition says that a change in the affine structure of\nthe manifold \\(M\\) preserves the projective structure \\(\\Pi\\) of \\(M\\)\nif the vectors \\(v^{i}_{q}\\) and \\(\\overline{v}^{i}_{q}\\) at \\(q\\)\nthat result from the vector \\(v^{i}_{p}\\) at \\(p\\) by parallel\ntransport under \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\overline{\\Gamma}\\) respectively,\ndiffer at most in length but not in\n direction.[41] \n\nA spacetime manifold \\(M\\) is a “projective manifold” \n(M, \\(\\Pi)\\), if in addition to its manifold structure (differential \ntopological structure), it is also endowed with a projective structure\n\\(\\Pi\\) that assigns to each of its manifold points 64 coefficients \n\\(\\Pi^{\\,i}_{jk} x^{i}(p))\\)\nsatisfying certain symmetry \n conditions.[42]\n These projective coefficients characterize the equivalence class \n[\\(\\Gamma\\)] of projectively equivalent connections, that is, \nconnections equivalent under the projective transformation \n(7).  \n\nIn physical spacetime the projective structure has an immediate \nintuitive significance according to Weyl. The real world is a \nnon-empty spacetime filled with an inertial-gravitational field, \nwhich Weyl calls the guiding field \n \\((F\\)ührungsfeld)[43].\n It is an indubitable fact, according to Weyl (1923a, 13), that a body\nwhich is let free in a certain spacetime direction (time-like \ndirection) carries out a uniquely determined natural motion from \nwhich it can only be diverted through an external force. The process \nof autoparallelism of direction appears, thus, as the tendency of \npersistence of the spacetime direction of a free particle whose \nmotion is governed by, what Weyl calls, the guiding field \n\\((F\\)ührungsfeld). This natural \nmotion occurs on the basis of an effective infinitesimal tendency of \npersistence, that parallelly displaces the spacetime direction \n\\(R\\) of a body at an arbitrary point \\(p\\) on its trajectory \nto a neighbouring point \\(p'\\) that lies in the direction \n\\(R\\) at \\(p\\).  \n\nIf external forces exert themselves on a body, then a motion results \nwhich is determined through the conflict between the tendency of \npersistence due to the guiding field and the force. The tendency of \npersistence of the guiding field is a type of constraining guidance, \nthat the inertial-gravitational field exerts on every body. Weyl \n(1923b, 219) says:  \n\nGalilei’s inertial law shows, that there exists a type of \nconstraining guidance in the world [spacetime] that imposes\non a body that is let free in some definite world direction a unique \nnatural motion from which it can only be diverted through external \nforces; this occurs on the basis of an effective infinitesimal \ntendency of persistence from point to point, that \nauto-parallelly transfers the world direction \\(r\\) of \nthe body at an arbitrary point \\(P\\) to an infinitesimally close \nneighboring point \\(P'\\), that lies in the direction \n\\(r\\) at \\(P\\). \n\nShortly after the completion of the general theory of relativity in \n1915, Einstein, Weyl, and others began to work on a unified field \ntheory. It was natural to assume at that \n time[44]\n that this task would only involve the unification of gravity and \nelectromagnetism. In Einstein’s geometrization of gravity, the \nNewtonian gravitational potential, and the Newtonian gravitational \nforce, are respectively replaced by the components of the metric \ntensor \\(g_{ij}(x)\\), and the components of \nthe symmetric linear connection \\(\\Gamma^{i}_{jk}(x)\\). In the general \ntheory of relativity the gravitational field is thus accounted for in\nterms of the curvature of spacetime, but the electromagnetic field \nremains completely unrelated to the spacetime geometry. Einstein’s \nmathematical formulation of his theory of general relativity does \nnot, however, provide room for the geometrization of the other long \nrange force field, the electromagnetic \n field.[45]\n It was therefore natural to ask whether nature’s only two long range \nfields of force have a common origin. Consequently, it was quite \nnatural to suggest that the electromagnetic field might also be \nascribed to some property of spacetime, instead of being merely \nsomething embedded in spacetime. Since, however, the components \n\\(g_{ij}(x)\\) of the metric tensor are \nalready sufficiently determined by Einstein’s field equations, this \nwould require setting up a more general differential geometry than \nthe one which underlies Einstein’s theory, in order to make room for \nincorporating electromagnetism into spacetime geometry. Such a \ngeneralized differential geometry would describe both long range \nforces, and a new theory based on this geometry would constitute a \nunified field theory of electromagnetism and gravitation.  \n\nIn 1918, Weyl proposed such a theory. In Weyl (1918a, 1919a), and in \nthe third edition (1920) of Raum-Zeit-Materie, Weyl \npresented his ingenious attempt to unify gravitation and \nelectromagnetism by constructing a gauge-invariant geometry (see \nbelow), or what he called a purely infinitesimal \n‘metric’ geometry. Since the conformal structure \n\\(C\\) (see below) of spacetime does not determine a unique \nsymmetric linear connection \\(\\Gamma\\) but only an equivalence class \n\\(K = [\\Gamma]\\) of conformally equivalent symmetric linear \nconnections, Weyl was able to show that this degree of freedom \nin a conformal structure of spacetime provides just enough room for \nthe geometrization of the electromagnetic potentials. The resulting \ngeometry, called a Weyl geometry, is an intermediate \ngeometric structure that lies between the conformal and Riemannian \n structures.[46] \n\nThe metric tensor field that is locally described by  \n\nis characteristic of a Riemannian geometry. That geometry requires of\nthe symmetric linear connection \\(\\Gamma\\) that the infinitesimal \nparallel transport of a vector always preserves the length of the \nvector. Therefore, the metric field in Riemannian geometry determines\na unique symmetric linear connection, a “metric \nconnection” that satisfies the length-preserving condition of \nparallel transport. This means that the metric field, locally \nrepresented by (8), is invariant under parallel transport. The \ncoefficients of this unique symmetric linear metric \nconnection are given by  \n\nIf \\(v_{p}\\) is a vector at \\(p \\in M\\), its length  \n\nMoreover, the angle between two vectors \\(v_{p}\\) \nand \\(w_{p}\\) at  \\(p\\in M\\) is given by  \n\nWhile in Riemannian geometry the parallel transport of length is \npath independent, that is, it is possible to compare the \nlengths of any two vectors, even if they are located at two finitely \ndifferent points, a vector suffers a path-dependent change \nin direction under parallel transport; that is, it is not \npossible to define the angle between two vectors, located at \ndifferent points, in a path-independent way. Consequently, the angle \nbetween two vectors at a given point is invariant under parallel \ntransport if and only if both vectors are transported along the \nsame path. In particular, a vector which is carried around a \nclosed circuit by a continual parallel displacement back to the \nstarting point, will have the same length, but will not in general \nreturn to its initial direction.  Figure 5: The parallel transport of a\nvector by a two-dimensional creature, from \\(A \\rightarrow B\n\\rightarrow C \\rightarrow A\\) around a geodesic triangle on a\ntwo-dimensional surface \\(S^{2}\\), ends up pointing in a different\ndirection upon returning to \\(A\\). \n\nFor a closed loop which circumscribes an infinitesimally small \nportion of space, the rotation of the vector per unit area \nconstitutes the measure of the local curvature of space. \nConsequently, whether or not finite parallel displacement of \ndirection is integrable, that is, path-independent, depends \non whether or not the curvature tensor vanishes.  \n\nAccording to Weyl, Riemannian geometry, is not a pure or genuine \ninfinitesimal differential (metric) geometry, since it\npermits the comparison of length at a finite distance. In his seminal\n1918 paper entitled Gravitation und Elektrizität\n(Gravitation and Electricity) Weyl (1918a) says:  \n\nHowever, in the Riemannian geometry described above, there remains a\nlast distant-geometric [ferngeometrisches] element—without any\nsound reason, as far as I can see; the only cause of this appears to\nbe the development of Riemannian geometry from the theory of\nsurfaces. The metric permits the comparison of length of two vectors\nnot only at the same point, but also at any arbitrarily separated\npoints. A true near-geometry (Nahegeometrie), however, may\nrecognize only a principle of transferring a length at a point to an\ninfinitesimal neighbouring point, and then it is no more\nreasonable to assume that the transfer of length from a point to a\nfinitely distant point is integrable, then it was to assume that the\ntransfer of direction is integrable. \n\nWeyl wanted a metric geometry which would not permit distance \ncomparison of length between two vectors located at finitely \ndifferent points. In a pure infinitesimal geometry, Weyl \nargued, if attention is restricted to a single point of the manifold,\nthen some standard of length or gauge must be chosen \narbitrarily before the lengths of vectors can be determined. \nTherefore, all that is intrinsic to the notion of a pure \ninfinitesimal metric differential geometry is the ability to \ndetermine the ratios of the lengths of any two vectors and \nthe angle between any two vectors, at a point. Such a pure \ninfinitesimal metric manifold must have at least a \nconformal structure \\(C\\).  \n\nThe defining characteristic of a conformal spacetime structure is \ngiven by the equation  \n\nwhich determines the light cone at \\(p\\). A gauge transformation \nof the metric is a map  \n\nwhich preserves the metric up to a positive and smooth but otherwise \narbitrary scalar factor or gauge function \n\\(\\lambda(x(p))\\). In the case of a pseudo-Riemannian \nstructure such a gauge transformation leaves the light cones \nunaltered. The angle between two vectors at \\(p\\) is given by \n(11). Clearly, the gauge transformation \n\\(\\overline{g}_{ij}(x(p)) = \\lambda(x(p))g_{ij}(x(p))\\)\nis angle preserving, that is, conformal. Two metrics which are \nrelated by a conformal gauge transformation are called \nconformally equivalent. A conformal structure does not \ndetermine the length of any one vector at a point. Only the relative \nlengths, the ratio of lengths, of any two vectors \n\\(\\bfrac{\\lvert v_p \\rvert}{\\lvert w_p \\rvert}\\)\nis determined.  \n\nWeyl exploited these features of the conformal structure, and \nsuggested that given a conformal structure, a gauge could be\nchosen at each point in a smooth but otherwise arbitrary manner, such\nthat the metric (8) at any point of the manifold is conventional or \nundetermined to the extent that the metric  \n\nis equally valid.  \n\nHowever, a conformal structure by itself does not determine a unique \nsymmetric linear connection; it only determines an equivalence class \nof conformally equivalent connections \\(K = [\\Gamma]\\), namely, \nconnections which preserve the conformal structure \\(C\\) during \nparallel transport. The difference between any two conformally \nequivalent symmetric linear connections \\(\\overline{\\Gamma}^{\\,i}_{jk}\\), \n\\(\\Gamma^i_{jk} \\in [\\Gamma]\\) is given by  \n\nwhere  \nis an arbitrary one-form field.  \n\nSince the conformal structure determines only an equivalence class of\nconformally equivalent symmetric linear connections \\(K = [\\Gamma]\\),\nthe affine connection in this type of geometry is not uniquely\ndetermined, and the parallel transport of vectors is not generally\nwell defined. Moreover, the ratio of the lengths of two vectors\nlocated at different points is not determined even in a path-dependent\nway. According to Weyl, it is a fundamental principle of infinitesimal\ngeometry that the metric structure on a manifold \\(M\\) determines a\nunique affine structure on \\(M\\). As was pointed out earlier, this\nprinciple is satisfied in Riemannian geometry where the metric\ndetermines a unique symmetric linear connection, namely, the metric\nconnection according to (9). Evidently this fundamental principle of\ninfinitesimal geometry is not satisfied for a structure which is\nmerely a conformal structure, since the conformal structure only\ndetermines an equivalence class of conformally equivalent symmetric\nconnections. Weyl showed that besides the conformal structure an\nadditional structure is required in order to determine a unique\nsymmetric linear connection from the equivalence class \n\\(K = [\\Gamma]\\) of conformally equivalent symmetric linear\nconnections. Weyl showed that this additional structure is provided by\nthe length connection or gauge field \\(A_{j}\\) that\ngoverns the congruent displacement of lengths. Weyl called\nthis additional structure the “metric connection” on a\nmanifold; however, we shall use the term “length\nconnection” instead, in order to avoid confusion with the modern\nusage of the term “metric connection”, which today denotes\nthe symmetric linear connection that is uniquely determined by a\nRiemannian metric tensor according to (9).  \nWeyl’s Length Connection:\nA point \\(p\\) is length connected with its infinitesimal\nneighborhood, if and only if for every length at \\(p\\), there is\ndetermined at every point \\(q\\) infinitesimally close to \\(p\\) a\nlength to which the length at \\(p\\) gives rise when it\nis congruently displaced from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\). \n\nThis definition merely says that a manifold is “length \nconnected” if it admits the process of infinitesimal congruent \ndisplacement of length. The only condition imposed on the concept of \ncongruent displacement of length is the following:  \n\nCongruent Displacement of Length: \nWith respect to a choice of gauge for a neighborhood of \\(p\\), the\ntransport of a length \\(l_{p}\\) at \\(p\\) to an infinitesimally\nneighboring point \\(q\\) constitutes a\ncongruent displacement if and only if there exists a choice \nof gauge for the neighborhood of \\(p\\) relative to which the \ntransported length \n\\(\\overline{l}_{q}\\) has the same value as \n\\(\\overline{l}_{p}\\); that is  \n\nWeyl called such a gauge at \\(p\\) a geodesic gauge at \n \\(p\\).[47]\n Weyl’s proof of the following theorem closely parallels the proof of \ntheorem A.3 in \n the supplement on Weyl’s metric independent construction of the affine connection.\n  \nTheorem 4.1: If for every point \\(p\\) in a \nneighborhood \\(U\\) of \\(M\\), there exists a choice of gauge \nsuch that the change in an arbitrary length at \\(p\\) under \ncongruent displacement to an infinitesimally near point \\(q\\) is \ngiven by  \n\nthen locally with respect to any other choice of gauge,  \nand conversely. \n\nMaking use of  \n\nWeyl (1923a, 124–125) shows that the conformal structure \nsupplemented with the structure of a length connection or \ngauge field \\(A_{j}(x)\\) singles \nout a unique connection from the equivalence class \\(K = [\\Gamma]\\) of \nconformally equivalent \n connections.[48]\n This unique connection, which is called the Weyl connection,\nis given by  \n\nwhich is analogous to (14). The first term of the Weyl connection is \nidentical to the metric connection (9) of Riemannian geometry, \nwhereas the second term represents what is new in a Weyl geometry. \nThe Weyl connection is invariant under the gauge transformation  \n\nwhere the gauge function is \\(\\lambda(x) = e^{\\theta(x)}\\). Thus, a\nconformal structure plus length connection or gauge\nfield \\(A_{j}(x)\\) determines a Weyl geometry\nequipped with a unique Weyl connection. Therefore, the \nfundamental principle of infinitesimal geometry also holds in a Weyl \ngeometry; that is, the metric structure of a Weyl geometry determines\na unique affine connection, namely, the Weyl connection.  \n\nIn Weyl’s physical interpretation of his purely infinitesimal metric \ngeometry (Weyl geometry), the gauge field \n\\(A_{j}(x)\\) is identified with the \nelectromagnetic four potential, and the electromagnetic field tensor \nis given by  \n\nA spacetime that is formally characterizable as a Weyl geometry, would\nnot only have a curvature of direction\n(Richtungskrümmung) but would also have a curvature\nof length (Streckenkrümmung). Because of the latter\nproperty the formal characterization of the congruent displacement of\nlength would be non-integrable, that is, path-dependent, in a Weyl\ngeometry.  Figure 6: \nIn a Weyl geometry parallel displacement of a vector along different\npaths not only changes its direction but also its\nlength \n\nSuppose physical spacetime corresponds to a Weyl geometry. Then two \nidentical clocks \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) at an event \\(p\\) with a \ncommon unit of time, that is, a timelike vector of given length \n\\(l_{p}\\), which are separated and moved along \ndifferent world lines to an event \\(q\\), will not only differ with\nrespect to the elapsed time (first clock effect (i.e., relativistic \neffect)), but in general the clocks will differ with respect to their\ncommon unit of time (rate of ticking) at \\(q\\) (second clock \neffect). That is, congruent time displacement in a Weyl geometry is \nsuch that two congruent time intervals at \\(p\\) will not in \ngeneral be congruent at \\(q\\), when congruently displaced in \nparallel along different world lines from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\), that \nis, \\(l^{A}_{q} \\ne l^{B}_{q}\\). \nThis means that a twin who travels to a distant star and then returns\nto earth would not only discover that the other twin on earth had \naged much more, but also that all the clocks on earth tick at a \ndifferent rate. Hence, in the presence of a non-vanishing \nelectromagnetic field \\(F_{jk}(x)\\) the \nclock rates will not in general be the same; that is, there will be a\nsecond clock effect in addition to the relativistic effect (first \nclock effect). Thus, \\(l^{A}_{q} = l^{B}_{q}\\) if \nand only if the curl of \\(A_{j}(x)\\) \nvanishes, that is, if and only if the electromagnetic field tensor \n\\(F_{jk}(x)\\) vanishes, namely,  \n\nIn that case the second term of the Weyl connection vanishes and (19)\nreduces to the metric connection (9) of Riemannian geometry.  \n\nIn a Weyl geometry there are no ideal absolute “meter \nsticks” or “clocks”. For example, the rate at which\nany clock measures time is a function of its history. However, as \nEinstein pointed out in a Nachtrag (addendum) to Weyl \n(1918a), it is precisely this situation which suggests that Weyl’s \ngeometry conflicts with experience. In Weyl’s geometry, the frequency\nof the spectral lines of atomic clocks would depend on the location \nand past histories of the atoms. But experience indicates otherwise. \nThe spectral lines are well-defined and sharp; they appear to be \nindependent of an atom’s history. Atomic clocks define units of time,\nand experience shows they are integrably transported. Thus, if we \nassume that the atomic time and the gravitational standard time are \nidentical, and that the gravitational standard time is determined by \nthe Weyl geometry, then the electromagnetic field tensor is zero. But\nif that is the case, then a Weyl geometry reduces to the standard \nRiemannian geometry that underlies general relativity, since the \nvanishing of Weyl’s Streckenkrümmung \n(length curvature) is necessary and sufficient for the \nexistence of a Riemannian metric \\(g_{ij}\\).  \n\nWhen \nquantum theory was developed a few years later it became clear that \nWeyl’s theory was in conflict with experience in an even more \nfundamental way since there is a direct relation between clock rates \nand masses of particles in quantum theory. A particle with a certain \nrest mass \\(m\\) possesses a natural frequency which is a function \nof its rest mass, the speed of light \\(c\\), and Planck’s constant \n\\(h\\). This means that in a Weyl geometry not only clocks would \ndepend on their histories but also the masses of particles. For \nexample, if two protons have different histories then they would also\nhave different masses in a Weyl geometry. But this violates the \nquantum mechanical principle that particles of the same kind—in\nthis case, protons—have to be exactly identical.  \n\nHowever, in 1918 it was still possible for Weyl to defend his theory \nin the following way. In response to Einstein’s criticism Weyl noted \nthat atoms, clocks and meter sticks are complex objects whose real \nbehavior in arbitrary gravitational and electromagnetic fields can \nonly be inferred from a dynamical theory of matter. Since no detailed\nand reliable dynamical models were available at that time, Weyl could\nargue that there is no reason to assume that, for example, clock \nrates are correctly modelled by the length of a timelike vector. Weyl\n(1919a, 67) said:  \n\nAt first glance it might be surprising that according to the purely\nclose-action geometry, length transfer is non-integrable in the\npresence of an electromagnetic field. Does this not clearly contradict\nthe behaviour of rigid bodies and clocks? The behaviour of these\nmeasurement instruments, however, is a physical process whose course\nis determined by natural laws and as such has nothing to do with the\nideal process of ‘congruent displacement of spacetime\ndistance’ that we employ in the mathematical construction of the\nspacetime geometry. The connection between the metric field and the\nbehaviour of rigid rods and clocks is already very unclear in the\ntheory of Special Relativity if one does not restrict oneself to\nquasi-stationary motion. Although these instruments play an\nindispensable role in praxis as indicators of the metric field, (for\nthis purpose, simpler processes would be preferable, for example, the\npropagation of light waves), it is clearly incorrect\nto define the metric field through the data that are directly\nobtained from these instruments. \n\nWeyl elaborated this idea by suggesting that the dynamical nature of\nsuch time keeping systems was such that they\ncontinually adapt to the spacetime structure in such a way\nthat their rates remain constant. He distinguished between quantities\nthat remain constant as a consequence of such dynamical\nadjustment, and quantities that remain constant\nby persistence because they are isolated and undisturbed. He\nargued that all quantities that maintain a perfect constancy probably\ndo so as a result of dynamical adjustment. Weyl (1921a, 261)\nexpressed these ideas in the following way:  \n\nWhat is the cause of this discrepancy between the idea of congruent \ntransfer and the behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks? I \ndifferentiate between the determination of a magnitude in Nature by \n“persistence” (Beharrung) and by \n“adjustment” (Einstellung). I shall make the \ndifference clear by the following illustration: We can give to the \naxis of a rotating top any arbitrary direction in space. This \narbitrary original direction then determines for all time the \ndirection of the axis of the top when left to itself, by means of a \ntendency of persistence which operates from moment to \nmoment; the axis experiences at every instant a parallel \ndisplacement. The exact opposite is the case for a magnetic needle in\na magnetic field. Its direction is determined at each instant \nindependently of the condition of the system at other instants by the\nfact that, in virtue of its constitution, the system adjusts \nitself in an unequivocally determined manner to the field in \nwhich it is situated. A priori we have no ground for \nassuming as integrable a transfer which results purely from the \ntendency of persistence. …Thus, although, for example, \nMaxwell’s equations demand the conservational equation \n\\(de\\,/\\,dt =0\\) for the charge \\(e\\) of an \nelectron, we are unable to understand from this fact why an electron,\neven after an indefinitely long time, always possesses an unaltered \ncharge, and why the same charge \\(e\\) is associated with all \nelectrons. This circumstance shows that the charge is not determined \nby persistence, but by adjustment, and that there can exist only \none state of equilibrium of the negative electricity, to \nwhich the corpuscle adjusts itself afresh at every instant. For the \nsame reason we can conclude the same thing for the spectral lines of \natoms. The one thing common to atoms emitting the same frequency is \ntheir constitution, and not the agreement of their frequencies on the\noccasion of an encounter in the distant past. Similarly, the length \nof a measuring-rod is obviously determined by adjustment, for I could\nnot give this measuring-rod in this field-position \nany other length arbitrarily (say double or treble length) in place \nof the length which it now possesses, in the manner in which I can at\nwill pre-determine its direction. The theoretical possibility of a \ndetermination of length by adjustment is given as a consequence of \nthe world-curvature, which arises from the metrical field \naccording to a complicated mathematical law. As a result of its \nconstitution, the measuring-rod assumes a length which possesses this\nor that value, in relation to the radius of curvature of the \nfield. \n\nWeyl’s response to Einstein’s criticism that a Weyl geometry \nconflicts with experience, took advantage of the fact that the \nunderlying dynamical laws of matter which govern clocks and rigid \nrods, were not known at that time. Weyl could thus argue that it is \nat least theoretically possible that there exists an \nunderlying dynamics of matter, such that a Weyl geometry, according \nto which length transfer is non-integrable, nonetheless coheres with \nobservable experience, according to which length transfer \nappears to be integrable. However, as was clearly pointed \nout by Wolfgang Pauli, Weyl’s plausible defence comes at a \n cost.[49]\n Pauli (1921/1958, 196) argued that Weyl’s defence of his theory \ndeprives it of its inherent convincing power from a physical point of\nview.  \n\nWeyl’s present attitude to this problem is the\nfollowing: The ideal process of the congruent transference of\nworld lengths … has nothing to do with the real behaviour of\nmeasuring rods and clocks; the metric field must not be defined by\nmeans of information taken from these measuring instruments. In\nthis case the quantities \\(g_{ik}\\) and \\(\\varphi_{i}\\) are, be\ndefinition, no longer observable, in contrast to the line elements of\nEinstein’s theory. This relinquishment seems to have very\nserious consequences. While there now no longer exists a direct\ncontradiction with experiment, the theory appears nevertheless to have\nbeen robbed of its inherent convincing power, from a physical point of\nview. For instance, the connexion between electromagnetism and world\nmetric is not now essentially physical, but purely formal. For there\nis no longer an immediate connection between the electromagnetic\nphenomena and the behaviour of measuring rods and clocks. There is\nonly an interrelation between the former and the ideal process which\nis mathematically defined as congruent transference of\nvectors. Besides, there exists only formal, and not physical, evidence\nfor a connection between world metric and\nelectricity.[50] \n\nPauli concluded his critical assessment of Weyl’s theory with the \nfollowing statement:  \n\nSummarizing, we can say that Weyl’s theory has not succeeded in \ngetting any nearer to solving the problem of the structure \nof matter. As will be argued in more detail … there is, \non the contrary, something to be said for the view that a solution of\nthis problem cannot at all be found in this way. \n\nIt should be noted, however, that Weyl’s defence of his theory \nimplicitly addresses an important methodological consideration \nconcerning the relation between theory and evidence. As Pauli puts it\nabove, according to Weyl “the metric field must not be \ndefined by means of information taken from these measuring \ninstruments [rigid rods and ideal clocks]”. That is, \nWeyl rejects Einstein’s operational standpoint which gives \noperational significance to the metric field in terms of the\nobservable behaviour of ideal rigid rods and ideal \n clocks.[51]\n Unlike light propagation and freely falling (spherically symmetric, \nneutral) particles, rigid rods and ideal clocks are relativistically \nill defined probative systems, and are thus unsuitable for the \ndetermination of the inherent structures of spacetime postulated by \nthe theory of relativity. Weyl (1918a) clearly recognized this when \nhe said in response to Einstein’s critique “because of the \nproblematic behaviour of yardsticks and clocks I have in my book \nSpace-Time-Matter restricted myself for the specific \nmeasurement of the \\(g_{ik}\\), exclusively to the \nobservation of the arrival of light signals.” It is interesting\nto note parenthetically that in the first edition of his book Weyl \nthought that it was possible to have an intrinsic method of comparing\nthe lengths of arbitrary spacetime intervals with an interval between\ntwo fiducial spacetime events, by using light signals only. It was \nLorentz who pointed out to Weyl that not only the world lines of \nlight rays but also the world lines of material bodies are required \nfor an intrinsic method of comparing lengths. Not only did Weyl \ncorrect this mistake in subsequent editions, but already in 1921, \nWeyl (1921c) discovered the causal-inertial method for determining \nthe spacetime metric (see §4.3) by proving an important theorem \nthat shows that the spacetime metric is already fully determined by \nthe inertial and causal structure of spacetime. Weyl (1949a, 103) \nremarks “… therefore mensuration need not depend on \nclocks and rigid bodies but … light signals and mass points \nmoving under the influence of inertia alone will suffice.” It \nis clear that Weyl regarded the use of clocks and rigid rods as an \nundesirable makeshift within the context of the special and general \ntheory. Since neither spatial nor temporal intervals are invariants \nof spacetime, the invariant spacetime interval \\(ds\\) cannot be \ndirectly ascertained by means of standard clocks and rigid rods. In \naddition, the latter presuppose quantum theoretical principles for \ntheir justification and therefore lie outside the relativistic \nframework because the laws which govern their physical processes are \nnot \n known.[52] \n\nWeyl (1929c, 233) abandoned his unified field theory only with the \nadvent of the quantum theory of the electron. He did so because in \nthat theory a different kind of gauge invariance associated with \nDirac’s theory of the electron was discovered, which more adequately \naccounted for the conservation of electric charge. Weyl’s \ncontributions to quantum mechanics, and his construction of a new \nprinciple of gauge invariance, are discussed in \n §4.5.3.[53] \n\nWeyl’s unified field theory was revived by Dirac (1973) in a slightly\nmodified form, which incorporated a real scalar field \n\\(\\beta(x)\\). Dirac also argued that the time intervals measured \nby atomic clocks need not be identified with the lengths of timelike \nvectors in the Weyl \n geometry.[54] \n\nPrior to the works of Gauss, Grassmann and Riemann, the study of \ngeometry tended to emphasize the employment of empirical intuitions \nand images of the three dimensional physical space. Physical space \nwas thought of as having definite metrical attributes. The task of \nthe geometer was to take physical mensuration devices in that space \nand work with them.  \n\nUnder the influence of Gauss and Grassmann, Riemann’s great \nphilosophical contribution consisted in the demonstration that, \nunlike the case of a discrete manifold, where the determination of a \nset necessarily implies the determination of its quantity or cardinal\nnumber, in the case of a continuous manifold, the concept of such a \nmanifold and of its continuity properties, can be separated form its \nmetrical structure. Using modern terminology, Riemann separated a \nmanifold’s local differential topological structure from its metrical\nstructure. Thus Riemann’s separation thesis gave rise to the \nspace problem, or as Weyl called it, das \nRaumproblem: how can metric relations be determined on a \ncontinuous manifold \\(M\\)?  \n\nA metric manifold is a manifold on which a distance function \n\\(f : M \\times M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) is defined. Such a \ndistance function must satisfy the following minimal conditions: for \nall \\(p, q, r \\in M\\),  \n\nIn his famous inaugural lecture at Göttingen, entitled \nÜber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu \nGrunde liegen (About the hypotheses which lie at the \nbasis of geometry), Riemann (1854) examined how metric relations\ncan be determined on a continuous manifold; that is, what specific \nform \\(f : M \\times M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) should \nhave. Consider the coordinates \\(x^{i}(p)\\) \nand \\(x^{i} (p) + dx^{i} (p)\\) of two neighboring \npoints \\(p, q \\in M\\). The measure of the \ndistance \\(ds = f(p,q)\\) must \nbe some function \\(F_{p}\\) at \\(p\\) of the \ndifferential increments \\(dx^{i}(p)\\); that is,  \n\nRiemann states that \\(F_{p}\\) should satisfy the \nfollowing requirements:  \nFunctional Homogeneity: If \\(\\lambda \\gt 0\\) and \n\\(ds = F_{p}(dx(p))\\), then \nSign Invariance: A change in sign of the \ndifferentials should leave the value of \\(ds\\) invariant. \n\nSign invariance is satisfied by every positive homogeneous function \nof degree \\(2m\\) \\((m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots)\\). In the simple \ncase \\(m = 1\\), and the length element \\(ds\\) is the square \nroot of a homogeneous function of second degree, which can be \nexpressed in the standard form  \n\nThat is, at each point of \\(M\\) there exists a coordinate system \n(defined up to an element of the orthogonal group \\(O(n)\\) \nin which the square root of the homogeneous function of second degree\ncan be expressed in the above standard form. Riemann’s well-known \ngeneral expression for the measure of length at \\(p \\in M\\) with \nrespect to an arbitrary coordinate system is given by  \n\nwhere the components of the metric tensor satisfy the symmetry \ncondition \\(g_{ij} = g_{ji}\\).  \n\nThe assumption that \\(ds^{2} = F^{2}_{p}\\) is a \nquadratic differential form is not only the simplest one, but also \nthe preferred one for other important reasons. Riemann himself was \nwell aware of other possibilities; for example, the possibility that \n\\(ds\\) could be the 4th root of a homogeneous polynomial of 4th \norder in the differentials. But Riemann restricted himself to the \nspecial case \\(m = 1\\) because he was pressed for time and because he \nwanted to give specific geometric interpretations of his results. As \nWeyl points out Riemann’s own answer to the space problem is \ninadequate since Riemann’s mathematical justification for the \nrestriction to the Pythagorean case are not very compelling. The \nfirst satisfactory justification of the Pythagorean form of the \nRiemannian metric, although limited in scope because it presupposed \nthe full homogeneity of Euclidean space, was provided by the \ninvestigations of Hermann von Helmholtz. Helmholtz diverged from \nRiemann’s analytic approach and made use merely of the fundamental \nconcept of geometry, namely, the concept of congruent \nmapping, and characterized the geometric structure of space by \nrequiring of space the full homogeneity of Euclidean space. His \nanalysis was thereby restricted to the cases of constant positive, \nzero, or negative curvature. Abstracting from our experience of the \nmovement of rigid bodies, Helmholtz was able to mathematically derive\nRiemann’s distance formula from a number of axioms about rigid body \nmotion in space. Helmholtz (1868) argued that Riemann’s hypothesis \nthat the metric structure of space is determined locally by a \nquadratic differential form, is really a consequence of the facts \n(Tatsachen) of rigid-body motion.  \n\nConsidering the general case of \\(n\\) dimensions, and using Lie \ngroups and Lie algebras, Sophus Lie, (Lie (1886/1935, 1890a,b)), \nlater developed and improved Helmholtz’s justification. However, the \nHelmholtz-Lie treatment of, and solution to, the problem of space, \nlost its relevance with the arrival of Einstein’s theory of general \nrelativity. As Weyl (1922b) points out, instead of a \nthree-dimensional continuum we must now consider a four-dimensional \ncontinuum, the metric of which is not positive definite but \nis given instead by an indefinite quadratic form. In \naddition, Helmholtz’s presupposition of metric homogeneity no longer \nholds, since we are now dealing with an inhomogeneous metric field \nthat causally depends on the distribution of matter. Consequently, \nWeyl provided a reformulation of the space problem that is compatible\nwith the causal and metric structures postulated by the theory of \ngeneral relativity. But Weyl went further. Such a reformulation \nshould not only incorporate Riemann’s infinitesimal \nstandpoint, as required by Einstein’s general theory, it should also \ncohere with Weyl’s requirements of a pure \ninfinitesimal geometry developed earlier in the \ncontext of Weyl’s construction of a unified field theory.  \n\nMore precisely, Weyl generalized the so-called \nRiemann-Helmholtz-Lie problem of space in two ways: First, \nhe allowed for indefinite metrics in order to encompass the \ngeneral theory of relativity. Secondly, he considered metrics with \nvariable gauge \\(\\lambda(x(p))\\) together with an \nassociated length connection, in order to obtain a \npurely infinitesimal geometry. Thus each member of a general\nclass of geometries under consideration is locally determined \nrelative to a choice of variable gauge by two structural fields \n(Strukturfelder): (1) a possibly indefinite Finsler metric \n field[55]\n \\(F_{p}(dx)\\), and (2) a length connection that is\ndetermined by a 1-form field \\(\\theta_{i}dx^{i}\\). Weyl’s task\nwas to prove:  \n\nIf the geometry satisfies the Postulate of Freedom, (the \nnature of space imposes no restrictions on admissible metrical \nrelations), and determines a unique, symmetric, linear connection \n\\(\\Gamma\\), then the Finsler metric field \n\\(F_{p}(dx)\\) must be a Riemannian metric field of \nsome \n signature.[56] \n\nIn a Riemannian space the concept of parallel displacement is defined\nby two conditions:  \n\nIt follows from these conditions that a Riemannian space possesses a \ndefinite symmetric linear connection—a symmetric linear \nmetric \n connection[58]—which\n is uniquely determined by the Pythagorean-Riemannian metric. Weyl \ncalls this:  \nThe Fundamental Postulate of Riemannian Geometry: Among the possible systems of parallel displacements of a\nvector to infinitely near points, that is among the possible \nsets of symmetric linear connection coefficients, there exists \none and only one set, and hence one and only one system of parallel \ndisplacement, which is length preserving. \n\nIn his \n lectures[59]\n on the mathematical analysis of the problem of space delivered in \n1922 at Barcelona and Madrid, Weyl sketched a proof demonstrating \nthat the following is also true:  \nUniqueness of the Pythagorean-Riemannian Metric: \nAmong all the possible infinitesimal metrics that can be put on a\ndifferentiable manifold, the Pythagorean-Riemannian metric is the only\ntype of metric that uniquely determines a symmetric linear\nconnection. \n\nWeyl begins his proof with two natural assumptions. First, the \nnature of the metric should be coordinate independent. If \n\\(ds\\) is given by an expression \n\\(F_{p}(dx^{1}, \\ldots ,dx^{n})\\) with respect to a given system \nof coordinates, then with respect to another system of coordinates, \n\\(ds\\) is given by a function that is related to \n\\(F_{p}(dx^{1}, \\ldots ,dx^{n})\\) by a linear, homogeneous \ntransformation of its arguments \\(dx^{i}\\). \nSecond, it is reasonable to assume that the nature of the \nmetric is the same everywhere, in the sense that at every point of \nthe manifold, and with respect to every coordinate system for a \nneighborhood of the point in question, \\(ds\\) is represented by an\nelement of the equivalence class \\([F]\\) of functions generated by\nany one such function, say \n\\(F_{p}(dx^{1}, \\ldots ,dx^{n})\\), by all linear, homogeneous \ntransformations of its arguments \\(dx^{i}\\).\n \n\nFor the case in which \\(F_{p}\\) is Pythagorean in \nform, namely the square root of a positive-definite quadratic form, \nthere exists just one possible equivalence class [\\(F\\)], because \nevery function that is the square root of a positive-definite \nquadratic form can be transformed to the standard expression  \n\nby means of a linear, homogeneous transformation.  \n\nTo every possible equivalence class [\\(F\\)] of homogeneous \nfunctions, there corresponds a type of metrical space. The \nPythagorean-Riemannian space, for which \n\\(F^{2}_{p} = (dx^{1})^{2} + \\cdots + (dx^{n})^{2}\\), is one among \nseveral types of possible metrical spaces. The problem, therefore, is\nto single out the equivalence class \\([F]\\), where \\(F\\) \ncorresponds to \n\\(F^{2}_{p} = (dx^{1})^{2} + \\cdots + (dx^{n})^{2}\\), from the other \npossibilities, and to provide arguments for this preference.  \n\nBy the term ‘metric’ Weyl means any \ninfinitesimal distance function \n\\(F_{p} \\in [F]\\), where the equivalence \nclass \\([F]\\) represents a type of metric structure or \nmetric field. Any such type of metric field structure has a \nmicrosymmetry group \\(G_{p}\\) at each \\(p \\in M\\).  \nDefinition 4.1 (Microsymmetry Group)\nA microsymmetry of a structural field (Strukturfeld) at a point \\(p\n\\in M\\) is a local diffeomorphism that takes \\(p \\in M\\) into \\(p\\)\nand preserves the structural field at \\(p \\in M\\).  The microsymmetry\ngroup of a field at \\(p \\in M\\) is the group of its microsymmetries at\n\\(p \\in M\\) under the operation of composition.\n \n\nA microsymmetry group \\(G_{p}\\), at \\(p \\in M\\), of a metric\nstructure, is a set of invertible, linear maps of the tangent space\n\\(T(M_{p})\\) onto itself, which preserve the infinitesimal distance\nfunction at \\(p \\in M\\). For every \\(p \\in M, G_{p}\\) is isomorphic to\none and the same abstract group.  \n\nFor a Riemannian type of metric structure the congruent linear maps \nof the tangent space T\\((M_{p})\\) onto itself form \na group \\(G_{p}\\) which is isomorphic to the \northogonal group \\(O(n)\\). The Pythagorean-Riemannian \nmetric at \\(p\\) is therefore determined through the concrete \nrealization of the orthogonal group at \\(p\\) which leaves\nthe fundamental quadratic differential form at \\(p\\) invariant. \nThus the Pythagorean-Riemannian type of metric is \ncharacterized by the abstract microsymmetry group \\(O(n)\\).\nFor a metric which is not of the Pythagorean-Riemannian metric type, \nthe abstract microsymmetry group \\(G_{p}\\) will be \ndifferent from \\(O(n)\\) and will be some other subgroup of \n\\(GL(n)\\). At each point of the manifold the microsymmetry \ngroup will be a concrete realization of this subgroup of \n\\(GL(n)\\). Weyl now states what he calls  \nThe Postulate of Freedom:\nIf only the nature (of whatever type) of the metric is\nspecified, that is, if only the corresponding abstract microsymmetry\ngroup \\(G_{p}\\) is specified, and the metric in\nquestion is otherwise left arbitrary, then the mutual\norientations of the corresponding microsymmetry groups at\ndifferent points are also left arbitrary. \n\nWeyl emphasizes that the Postulate of Freedom provides the \ngeneral framework for a concise formulation of  \nThe Hypothesis of Dynamical Geometry:\nWhatever the nature or type of the metric may be—provided it\nis the same everywhere—the variations in the mutual\norientations of the concrete microsymmetry groups from point to\npoint are causally determined by the material content that fills\nspace. \n\nIn contrast with Helmholtz’s analysis, which presupposes the \nhomogeneity of space, the Postulate of Freedom allows for \nthe possibility of replacing Helmholtz’s homogeneity requirement with\nthe possibility of subjecting the metric field to arbitrary, \ninfinitesimal change. To assert this dynamical possibility does \nnot require that the nature of the metric be specified.  \n\nNext, Weyl points out that what has been provided so far is merely an\nexplication of the concepts metric, length \nconnection and symmetric linear connection. Some \nclaim which goes beyond conceptual analysis has to be made, according\nto Weyl, in order to prove that among the various types of possible \nmetrical structures that can be put on a differentiable manifold \nrepresenting physical space, the Pythagorean-Riemannian form is \nunique. Weyl suggests the following hypothesis:  \nWeyl’s Hypothesis:\nWhatever determination the essentially free length connection at some\npoint \\(p\\) of the manifold may realize with the points in its\ninfinitesimal neighborhood, there always exists among the possible\nsystems of parallel displacements of the tangent space\n\\(T(M_{p})\\), one and only one, which is at the same\ntime a system of infinitesimal congruent transport.\n \n\nWeyl shows that this hypothesis does in fact single out metrics of \nthe Pythagorean-Riemannian type by proving the following theorem:  \nTheorem 4.2\nIf a specific length connection is such that it determines a unique\nsymmetric linear connection, then the metric must be of the\nPythagorean-Riemannian form (for some signature). \n\nThus the Postulate of Freedom and Weyl’s\nHypothesis together entail the existence, at each \\(p \\in M\\), of\na non-degenerate quadratic form that is unique up to a choice of gauge\nat \\(p \\in M\\), and that is invariant under the action of the\nmicrosymmetry group \\(G_{p}\\) that is isomorphic to an orthogonal\ngroup of some signature.  \n\nThis formulation suggests, according to Weyl, an intuitive contrast \nbetween Euclidean ‘distance-geometry’ and the \n‘near-geometry’ (Nahegeometrie) or \n‘field-geometry’ of Riemann. Weyl (1949a, 88) \ncompared Euclidean ‘distance-geometry’ to a crystal \n“built up from uniform unchangeable atoms in the rigid and \nunchangeable arrangement of a lattice”, and the latter \n[Riemannian field-geometry] to a liquid, “consisting \nof the same indiscernible unchangeable atoms, whose arrangement and \norientation, however, are mobile and yielding to forces acting upon \nthem.”  \n\nThe nature of the metric field, that is the nature \nof the metric everywhere, is the same and is, therefore, \nabsolutely determined. It reflects according to Weyl, the a \npriori structure of space or spacetime. In contrast, what is \nposteriori, that is, accidental and capable of continuous \nchange being causally dependent on the material content that fills \nspace, are the mutual orientations of the metrics at \ndifferent points. Hence, the demarcation between the \\(a\\) \npriori and the a posteriori has shifted, according \nto Weyl: Euclidean geometry is still preserved for the infinitesimal \nneighborhood of any given point, but the coordinate system in which \nthe metrical law assumes the standard form \n\\(ds^{2} =\\sum^{n}_{i=1}(dx^{i})^{2}\\)\nis in general different from place to place.  \n\nWeyl’s a priori and a posteriori distinction must \nnot be confused with Kant’s distinction. Weyl (1949a, 134) remarks: \n“In the case of physical space it is possible to \ncounterdistinguish aprioristic and aposterioristic features in a \ncertain objective sense without, like Kant, referring to their \ncognitive source or their cognitive character.” Weyl makes the \nsame remark in (Weyl, 1922b, 266). See also the discussion in \n§4.5.8.  \n\nIn the context of his group-theoretical analysis, Weyl (1922b, p. \n266) makes the following interesting and important statement:  \n\nI remark from an epistemological point of view: it is not correct to \nsay that space or the world [spacetime] is in itself, prior to any \nmaterial content, merely a formless continuous manifold in the sense \nof analysis situs; the nature of the metric [its \ninfinitesimal Pythagorean-Riemannian character] is characteristic of \nspace in itself, only the mutual orientation of the metrics at the \nvarious points is contingent, a posteriori and dependent on the \nmaterial content. \n\nWithin the context of general relativity, empty spacetime is \nimpossible, if ‘empty’ is understood to mean not merely \nempty of all matter but also empty of all fields. \nAt another place, Weyl (1949a, Engl. edn, 172) says:  \n\nGeometry unites organically with the field theory; space is not \nopposed to things (as it is in substance theory) like an empty vessel\ninto which they are placed and which endows them with far-geometrical\nrelationships. No empty space exists here; the assumption that the \nfield omits a portion of the space is absurd. \n\nAccording to Weyl, the metric field does not cease to exist in a world\ndevoid of matter but is in a state of rest: As a rest field\nit would possess the property of metric homogeneity; the\nmutual orientations of the orthogonal groups\ncharacterizing the Pythagorean-Riemannian nature of the metric\neverywhere would not differ from point to point. This means that\nin a matter-empty universe the metric is fixed. Consequently, the set\nof congruence relations on spacetime is uniquely determined.\nSince the metric uniquely determines the symmetric linear connection,\nthe homogeneous metric field (rest field) determines\nan integrable affine structure. Therefore, a flat Minkowski\nspacetime consistent with the complete absence of matter is endowed\nwith an integrable connection and thus determines all\n(hypothetical) free motions. According to Weyl, there exists in the\nabsence of matter a homogeneous metric field, a structural field\n(Strukturfeld), which has the character of a rest\nfield, and which constitutes an all pervasive background that cannot\nbe eliminated. The structure of this rest field determines\nthe extension of the spacetime congruence relations and\ndetermines Lorentz invariance. The rest\nfield possesses no net energy and makes no contribution to \ncurvature.  \n\nThe contrast with Helmholtz and Lie is this: both of them require \nhomogeneity and isotropy for physical space. From a general \nRiemannian standpoint, the latter characteristics are valid only for \na matter-empty universe. Such a universe is flat and Euclidean, \nwhereas a universe that contains matter is inhomogeneous, \nanisotropic and of variable curvature.  \n\nIt is important to note here that the validity of Weyl’s assertion \nthat the metric field does not cease to exist but is in a state of \nrest, has its source in the mathematical fact that the metric field \nis a \\(G\\)-structure. A \\(G\\)-structure may be flat or non-flat; but a \n\\(G\\)-structure can never vanish. Consequently, geometric fields \ncharacterizable as \\(G\\)-structures, such as the projective, conformal, \naffine and metric structures, do not \n vanish.[60] \n\nRiemann searched for the most general type of an \\(n\\)-dimensional\nmanifold. On this manifold, Euclidean geometry turns out to be a \nspecial case resulting from a certain form of the metric. Weyl takes \nthis general structure, the manifold structure, which has certain \ncontinuity and order properties, as basic, but leaves the \ndetermination of the other geometrical structures, such as the \nprojective, conformal, affine and metric structures, open. The \nmetrical axioms are no longer dictated, as they were for Kant, by \npure intuition. According to Weyl (1949a, 87), for Riemann the metric\nis not, as it was for Kant, “part of the static homogeneous \nform of phenomena, but of their ever changing material \ncontent”. Weyl (1931a, 338) says:  \n\nWe differentiate now between the amorphous continuum and its metrical\nstructure. The first has retained its a priori \n character,[61]\n … whereas the structural field [Strukturfeld] is completely \nsubjected to the power-play of the world; being a real entity, \nEinstein prefers to call it the ether. \n\nThere is no indication in Riemann’s work on gravitation and\nelectromagnetism that would indicate that he anticipated the\nconceptual revolution underlying Einstein’s theory. However,\nWeyl’s interpretation of Riemann’s work suggests that\nRiemann foresaw something like its possibility in the following\nsense:  \n\nBy formally separating the post-topological structures such as the \naffine, projective, conformal and metric structures from the \nmanifold, so that these structures are no longer rigidly tied to it, \nRiemann deprived them of their formal geometric rigidity and, on the \nbasis of his infinitesimal geometric standpoint or \n“near-geometry”, allowed for the possibility of \ninterpreting them as mathematical representations of flexible, \ndynamical physical structural fields [Strukturfelder] on the manifold\nof spacetime, geometrical fields that reciprocally interact with \nmatter. \n\nRiemann’s separation thesis together with his adoption of the \ninfinitesimal standpoint, were prerequisite steps for the development\nof differential geometry as the mathematics of differentiable \ngeometric fields on manifolds. When interpreted physically, these \nmathematical structures or geometrical fields correspond, as Weyl \nsays, to physical structural fields (Strukturfelder). Analogous to \nthe electromagnetic field, these structural fields act on matter and \nare in turn acted on by matter. Weyl (1931a, 337) remarks:  \n\nI now come to the crucial idea of the theory of General Relativity. \nWhatever exerts as powerful and real effects as does the\nmetric structure of the world, cannot be a rigid, once and for \nall, fixed geometrical structure of the world, but must \nitself be something real which not only exerts effects on \nmatter but which in turn suffers them through matter. Riemann \nalready suggested for space the idea that the structural field, like \nthe electromagnetic field, reciprocally interacts with matter. \n\nWeyl (1931a, 338) continues:  \n\nWe already explained with the example of inertia, that the structural\nfield [Strukturfeld] must, as a close-action [Nahewirkung], be \nunderstood infinitesimally. How this can occur with the metric \nstructure of space, Riemann abstracted from Gauss’s theory of curved \nsurfaces. \n\nThe various geometrical fields are not “intrinsic” to the\nmanifold structure of spacetime. The manifold represents an amorphous\nfour-dimensional differentiable continuum in the sense of \nanalysis situs and has no properties besides those that fall\nunder the concept of a manifold.  \n\nThe amorphous four-dimensional differentiable manifold possesses a \nhigh degree of symmetry. Because of its homogeneity, all points are \nalike; there are no objective geometric properties that enable one to\ndistinguish one point from another. This full homogeneity or symmetry\nof space must be described by its group of automorphisms, \nthe one-to-one mappings of the point field onto itself which leave \nall relations of objective significance between points undisturbed. \nIf a geometric object \\(F\\), that is a point set with a definite \nrelational structure is given, then those automorphisms of space that\nleave \\(F\\) invariant, constitute a group and this group describes\nexactly the symmetry which \\(F\\) possesses. For instance, to use \nan example by Weyl (1938b) (see also Weyl (1949a, 72–73) and \nWeyl (1952)), if \n\\(R(p_{1},p_{2},p_{3})\\) is a ternary relation that asserts \n\\(p_{1},p_{2},p_{3}\\)\nlie on a straight line, then we require that any three points, \nsatisfying this relation \\(R\\), are mapped by an automorphism into\nthree other points \n\\(p_{1}',p_{2}',p_{3}'\\),\nfulfilling the same relation.  \n\nThe group of automorphisms of the \\(n\\)-dimensional number space \ncontains only the identity map, since all numbers of \n\\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) are distinct individuals. It is \nessentially for this reason that the real numbers are used for \ncoordinate descriptions. Whereas the continuum of real numbers \nconsists of individuals, the continua of space, time, and spacetime \nare homogeneous. Spacetime points do not admit of an absolute \ncharacterization; they can be distinguished, according to Weyl, only \nby “a demonstrative act, by pointing and saying \nhere-now”.  \n\nIn a little book entitled Riemanns geometrische Ideen, ihre \nAuswirkung und ihre Verknüpfung mit \nder Gruppentheorie, published posthumously in 1988, Weyl (1988, \n4–5) makes this interesting comment:  \n\nCoordinates are introduced on the Mf [manifold] in the most direct \nway through the mapping onto the number space, in such a way, that \nall coordinates, which arise through one-to-one continuous \ntransformations, are equally possible. With this the coordinate \nconcept breaks loose from all special constructions to which it was \nbound earlier in geometry. In the language of relativity this means: \nThe coordinates are not measured, their values are not read off from \nreal measuring rods which react in a definite way to physical fields \nand the metrical structure, rather they are a priori placed in the \nworld arbitrarily, in order to characterize those physical fields \nincluding the metric structure numerically. The metric structure \nbecomes through this, so to speak, freed from space; it becomes an \nexisting field within the remaining structure-less space. Through \nthis, space as form of appearance contrasts more clearly with its \nreal content: The content is measured after the form is arbitrarily \nrelated to coordinates. \n\nBy mapping a given spacetime homeomorphically onto the real number \nspace, providing through the arbitrariness of the mapping, what Weyl \ncalls, a qualitatively non-differentiated field of free \npossibilities—the continuum of all possible \ncoincidences—we represent spacetime points by their coordinates\ncorresponding to some coordinate system. The four-dimensional \narithmetical space can be utilized as a four-dimensional schema for \nthe localization of events of all possible “here-nows”.  \n\nPhysical dynamical quantities in spacetime, such as the geometrical \nstructural fields on the four-dimensional spacetime continuum, are \ndescribable as functions of a variable point which ranges over the \nfour-dimensional number space \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\). Instead of \nthinking of the spacetime points as real substantival entities, and \nany talk of fields as just a convenient way of describing geometrical\nrelations between points, one thinks of the geometrical fields such \nas the projective, conformal causal, affine and metric fields, as \nreal physical entities with dynamical properties, such as energy, \nmomentum and angular momentum, and the field points as mere \nmathematical abstractions. Spacetime is not a medium in the sense of \nthe old ether concept. No ether in that sense exists here. Just as \nthe electromagnetic fields are not states of a medium but constitute \nindependent realities which are not reducible to anything else, so, \naccording to Weyl, the geometrical fields are independent irreducible\nphysical \n fields.[62] \n\nA class of geometric structural fields of a given type is \ncharacterized by a particular Lie group. A geometric structural field\nbelonging to a given class has a microsymmetry group (see definition \n4.1) at each point \\(p \\in M\\) which is isomorphic to \nthe Lie group that is characteristic of the class. In relativity \ntheory, this microsymmetry group is isomorphic to the Lorentz group \nand leaves invariant a pseudo-Riemannian metric of Lorentzian \nsignature.  \n\nThe different types of geometric, structural fields may be \nrepresented from a modern mathematical point of view as cross \nsections of appropriate fiber bundles over the manifold \\(M\\); \nthat is, the amorphous manifold \\(M\\) has associated with it \nvarious geometric fields in terms of a mapping of a certain kind \n(called a cross section) from the manifold \\(M\\) to the \ncorresponding bundle space over \n \\(M\\).[63]\n In particular, Einstein’s general theory of relativity postulates a \nphysical field, the metrical field, which, mathematically speaking, \nmay be characterized as a cross section of the bundle of \nnon-degenerate, second-order, symmetric, covariant tensors of Lorentz\nsignature over \\(M\\). Weyl (1931a, 336) says of this world \nstructure:  \n\nHowever this structure is to be exactly and completely described and \nwhatever its inner ground might be, all laws of nature show that it \nconstitutes the most decisive influence on the evolution of physical \nevents: the behavior of rigid bodies and clocks is almost exclusively\ndetermined through the metric structure, as is the pattern of the \nmotion of a force-free mass point and the propagation of a light \nsource. And only through these effects on the concrete natural \nprocesses can we recognize this structure. \n\nThe views of Weyl are diametrically opposed to geometrical\nconventionalism and some forms of relationalism. According to Weyl,\nwe discover through the behavior of physical phenomena an\nalready determined metrical structure of spacetime. The metrical\nrelations of physical objects are determined by a physical field, the\nmetric field, which is represented by the second rank metric tensor\nfield. Contrary to geometric conventionalism, spacetime geometry is\nnot about rigid rods, ideal clocks, light rays or freely falling\nparticles, except in the derivative sense of providing information\nabout the physically real metric field which, according to Weyl, is as\nphysically real as is the electromagnetic field, and which determines\nand explains the metrical behavior of congruence standards under\ntransport. The metrical field has physical and metrical\nsignificance, and the metrical significance does not consist in the\nmere articulation of relations obtaining between, say, rigid rods or\nideal clocks.  \n\nThe special and general, as well as the non-relativistic spacetime \ntheories postulate various structural constraints which events are \nheld to satisfy. When interpreted physically, these mathematical \nstructures or constraints correspond to physical structural fields \n(Strukturfelder). Analogous to the electromagnetic field, \nthese structural fields act on matter and are, within the context of \nthe general theory of relativity, in turn acted on by matter. An \n\\(n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\) whose sole properties are \nthose that fall under the concept of a manifold, Weyl (1918b) \nphysically interprets as an \\(n\\)-dimensional empty world, that \nis, a world empty of both matter and fields. On the other hand, an \n\\(n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\) that is an affinely connected \nmanifold, Weyl physically interprets as an \\(n\\)-dimensional world\nfilled with a gravitational field, and an \\(n\\)-dimensional \nmanifold \\(M\\) endowed with a projective structure represents an \n\\(n\\)-dimensional non-empty world filled with an \ninertial-gravitational field, or what Weyl calls the guiding \nfield Führungsfeld). In a \nsimilar vein, an \\(n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\) that \npossesses a conformal structure of Lorentz type, represents a \nnon-empty \\(n\\)-dimensional world filled with a causal field. \nFinally, an \\(n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\) endowed with a \nmetrical structure may be interpreted physically as an \n\\(n\\)-dimensional non-empty world filled with a metric field.  \n\nThe mathematical model of physical spacetime is the four-dimensional \npseudo-Riemannian manifold. Weyl (1921c) distinguished between two \nprimitive substructures of that model: the conformal and \nprojective structures and showed that the conformal \nstructure, modelling the causal field governing light \npropagation, and the projective structure, modelling the inertial or \nguiding field governing all free (fall) motions, uniquely \ndetermine the metric. That is, Weyl (1921c) proved  \nTheorem 4.3\nThe projective and conformal structure of a metric space determine the\nmetric uniquely. \n\nA metric \\(g\\) on a manifold determines a first-order conformal \nstructure on the manifold, namely, an equivalence class of \nconformally related metrics  \n\nA metric \\(g\\) also uniquely determines a symmetric linear \nconnection \\(\\Gamma\\) on the manifold. Under a conformal transformation  \n\nthe change of the components of the symmetric linear connection is \ngiven by (14), that is,  \n\nThus the set of all arbitrary conformal transformations of the metric\ninduces an equivalence class \\(K\\) of conformally related \nsymmetric linear connections. This equivalence class \\(K\\) \nconstitutes a second-order conformal structure on the manifold and \nthe difference between any two connections in the equivalence class \nis given by (29). Weyl shows that a conformal transformation (29) \npreserves the projective structure and hence is a projective \ntransformation (that is, a conformal transformation which also \nsatisfies (7)), if and only if \\(\\theta_{j} = 0\\), in \nwhich case the conformal and projective structures are compatible. \nWeyl remarks after the proof:  \n\nIf it is possible for us, in the real world, to discern causal \npropagation, and in particular light propagation, and if moreover, we\nare able to recognize and observe as such the motion of free mass \npoints which follow the guiding field, then we are able to read off \nthe metric field from this alone, without reliance on clocks and \nrigid rods. \n\nElsewhere, Weyl (1949a, 103) says:  \n\nAs a matter of fact it can be shown that the metrical structure of \nthe world is already fully determined by its inertial and causal \nstructure, that therefore mensuration need not depend on clocks and \nrigid bodies but that light signals and mass points moving under the \ninfluence of inertia alone will suffice. \n\nThe use of clocks and rigid rods is, within the context of either \ntheory, an undesirable makeshift for two reasons. First, since \nneither spatial nor temporal intervals are invariants of the \nfour-dimensional spacetime of the special theory of relativity and \nthe general theory of relativity, the invariant spacetime interval \n\\(ds\\) cannot be directly ascertained by means of standard clocks \nand rigid rods. Second, the concepts of a rigid body and a periodic \nsystem (such as pendulums or atomic clocks) are not fundamental or \ntheoretically self-sufficient, but involve assumptions that \npresuppose quantum theoretical principles for their justification and\nthus lie outside the present conceptual relativistic framework. \nTherefore, methodological and ontological considerations decidedly \nfavor Weyl’s causal-inertial method for determining the spacetime \nmetric.  \n\nFrom the physical point of view, Weyl emphasized the roles of light \npropagation and free (fall) motion in revealing the conformal-causal \nand the projective structures respectively. However, from the \nmathematical point of view, Weyl did not use these two structures \ndirectly in order to derive from them and their compatibility \nrelation, the metric field. Rather, Weyl regarded the metric and \naffine structures as fundamental and showed that the conformal and \nthe projective structures respectively arise from those structures by\nmathematical abstraction.  Figure 7:\nWeyl took the metric and affines structures as fundamental and showed\nthat the conformal and projective structures respectively arise from\nthem by mathematical abstraction. \n\nEhlers et al. (1972) generalized Weyl’s causal-inertial method by \nderiving the metric field directly from the conformal and \nprojective fields and derived a unique pseudo-Riemannian spacetime \nmetric solely as a consequence of a set of natural, physically \nwell-motivated, constructive, “geometry-free” axioms \nconcerning the incidence and differential properties of light \npropagation and free (fall) motion. Ehlers, Pirani and Schild adopt \nReichenbach’s (1924) term, constructive axiomatics to \ndescribe the nature of their approach. The \n“geometry-free” axioms are propositions about a few \ngeneral qualitative assumptions concerning free (fall) motion and \nlight propagation that can be verified directly through experience in\na way that does not presuppose the full blown edifice of the general \ntheory of relativity. From these axioms, the theoretical basis of the\ntheory is reconstructed step by step.  \n\nThe constructive axiomatic approach to spacetime structure is roughly\nthis:  \n\nPrimitive Notions. The constructive axiomatic \napproach is based on a triple of sets \n\nof objects corresponding respectively to the notions of events, \nparticle paths and light rays, which are taken as \nprimitive. The set \\(M\\) of events is assumed to have a Hausdorff \ntopology with a countable basis in order to state local axioms \nthrough the use of such terms as “neighborhood”. Members \nof the sets \\(\\mathcal{P} = \\{P, Q, P_{1}, Q_{1}, \\ldots \\}\\) and \n\\(\\mathcal{L} = \\{ L, N, L_{1}, N_{1}, \\ldots \\}\\) are subsets of \n\\(M\\) that represent the possible or actual paths of massive \nparticles and light rays in spacetime.  \n\nDifferential Structure. The differential structure \nis not presupposed; rather through the first few axioms a \ndifferential-manifold structure is introduced on the set of events \n\\(M\\) that is sufficient for the localization of events by means \nof local coordinates, such as radar coordinates. Once \\(M\\) is \ngiven a differential-manifold structure through the introduction of \nlocal radar coordinates by means of particles and light rays (such \nthat any two radar coordinates are smoothly related to one another), \none can do calculus on \\(M\\) and one may speak of tangent and \ndirection spaces. \n\nIt is important to emphasize that the members of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\)\nrepresent possible or actual paths of arbitrary massive\nparticles that may have some internal structure such as higher order\ngravitational and electromagnetic multipole moments and that may\ntherefore interact in complicated ways with various physical\nfields. In order to constructively establish the projective structure\nof spacetime, it is necessary to single out a subset of\n\\(\\mathcal{P}\\), namely \\(\\mathcal{P}_{f}\\), the set of possible or\nactual paths of spherically symmetric, electrically neutral particles\n(that is, the world lines of freely falling particles). However, the\nset \\(\\mathcal{P}_{f} \\subset \\mathcal{P}\\), can be properly \ncharacterized only after a coordinate system (differential structure)\nis available. Consequently, one must employ arbitrary \nparticles in the statement of those axioms that lead to the local \ndifferential structure of spacetime.  \n\nSecond-Order Conformal Structure. The Law of \nCausality asserts the existence of a unique first-order \nconformal structure on spacetime (27), that is, a field of \ninfinitesimal light cones. \n\nOnly null one-directions are determined. Therefore no special choice \nof parameters along light rays is determined by this structure. The \nfirst-order conformal structure can be measured using only the local \ndifferential-topological structure. Moreover, by a purely \nmathematical process involving only differentiation, the first-order \nconformal structure determines a second-order conformal structure, \nnamely, an equivalence class \\(K\\) of conformally related \nsymmetric linear connections.  \n\nProjective Structure. The motions of freely falling \nparticles governed by the guiding field reveal the geodesics of \nspacetime, that is, the geodesics corresponding to an equivalence \nclass \\(\\Pi\\) of projectively equivalent symmetric linear connections. \nOnly geodesic one-directions are determined, that is, no special \nchoice of parameters is involved in characterizing free fall motion. \n\nCompatibility between the Conformal and Projective \nStructures. That the conformal and projective structures are\ncompatible is suggested by high energy experiments, according to \nEhlers, Pirani and Schild: “A massive particle \\((m \\gt 0)\\), \nthough always slower than a photon, can be made to chase a photon \narbitrarily closely.” Ehlers, Pirani and Schild \ntherefore assume an axiom of compatibility between the conformal and \nprojective structures, and this leads to a Weyl space: If \nthe projective and conformal structures are compatible, then the \nintersection \n\nof the equivalence class \\(K\\) of conformally equivalent symmetric\nlinear connections, and the equivalence class \\(\\Pi\\) of projectively \nequivalent symmetric linear connections, contains a unique symmetric \nlinear connection, a Weyl connection. Thus light propagation\nand free (fall) motion reveal on spacetime a unique Weyl connection \nwhich determines the parallel transport of vectors, preserving their \ntimelike, null or spacelike character, and for any pair of non-null \nvectors, the Weyl connection leaves invariant the ratio of their \nlengths and the angle between them, provided the vectors are \ntransported along the same path.  \n\nPseudo-Riemannian Metric. Since length transfer is \nnon-integrable (i.e., path-dependent) in a Weyl space, a Weyl \ngeometry reduces to a pseudo-Riemannian geometry if and only if \nWeyl’s length-curvature \n(Streckenkrümmung) tensor equals \nzero, in which case the length of a vector is path-independent under \nparallel transport, and there exists no second clock effect. \n\nCan it be argued that Ehlers, Pirani and Schild’s generalization of \nWeyl’s causal-inertial method for determining the spacetime metric \nconstitutes a convention-free, and – in relevant respects \n– theory-independent body of evidence that can adjudicate \nbetween spacetime geometries, and hence between spacetime theories \nthat postulate them? As Weyl showed, we can empirically determine the\nmetric field, provided certain epistemic conditions are satisfied, \nthat is, provided we can measure the conformal-causal structure, and \nprovided “we are able to recognize and observe as such the \nmotion of free mass points which follow the guiding field.” \nCriticisms of Ehlers, Pirani and Schild’s constructive axiomatics \nsuggest that the causal-inertial method is not convention-free and \nthat it is ineffective epistemologically in providing a possible \nsolution to the controversy between geometrical realism and \nconventionalism in favor of realism. Basically, all of the charges \nlaid against Ehlers, Pirani and Schild’s constructive axiomatics \nconcentrate on the roles which massive particles play in their \nconstruction. One of the constructive axioms employed by Ehlers, \nPirani and Schild, the projective axiom, is a statement of the \ninfinitesimal version of the Law of Inertia, the law of free (fall) \nmotion which contains Newton’s first law of motion as a special case \nin the absence of gravitation. Since Ehlers, Pirani and Schild do not\nprovide an independent, non-circular criterion by which to \ncharacterize free (fall) motion, their approach has been charged with\ncircularity by philosophers such as Grünbaum (1973), Salmon \n(1977), Sklar (1977) and Winnie (1977).  \n\nThe problem is a familiar one; how to introduce a class of preferred\nmotions, that is, how to characterize that particular path structure\nthat would govern the motions of free particles \\(\\mathcal{P}_{f}\\),\nthat is, neutral, spherically symmetric, non-rotating test bodies,\nwhile avoiding the circularity problem surrounding the notion of\na free particle: The only way of knowing when no forces act\non a body is by observing that it moves as a free particle along the\ngeodesics of spacetime. But how, without already knowing the geodesics\nor the projective structure of spacetime is it possible to determine\nwhich particles are free and which are not? And to determine the\nprojective structure of spacetime it is necessary to use free\nparticles.  \n\nColeman and Korté (1980) have addressed these and related \ndifficulties by providing a non-conventional procedure for the \nempirical determination of the projective \n structure.[64] \n\nIt is worth emphasizing that Weyl’s approach to differential \ngeometry, in which the affine, projective and conformal structures \nare treated in their own right rather than as mere aspects of the \nmetric, was instrumental for his discovery of the non-circular and \nnon-conventional geodesic method for the empirical determination of \nthe spacetimet metric. The old notion of a ‘geodesic \npath’ had its inception in the context of classical \nmetrical geometry and ‘geodesicity’ was \ncharacterized in terms of extremal paths of curves, which \npresupposed a metric. It was Weyl’s metric-independent construction \nof the symmetric linear connection that led him to introduce the \ngeometry of paths and the metric-independent characterization of a \ngeodesic path in terms of the process of autoparallelism of \nits tangent direction.  \n\nWeyl provided a general conceptual/mathematical clarification of the \nconcept of motion that applies to any spacetime theory that is based \non a differential manifold. In particular, Weyl’s penetrating \nanalysis shows that Einstein’s understanding of the role and \nsignificance of Mach’s Principle for the general theory of relativity\nand cosmology is actually inconsistent with the basic principles of \ngeneral relativity.  \n\nWeyl’s major contribution to cosmology is known as “Weyl’s \nHypothesis”. The name was coined by Weyl (1926d) himself in an \narticle in the Encyclopedia of \n Britannica.[65]\n According to Weyl’s Postulate, the worldlines of all galaxies are \nnon-intersecting diverging geodesics that have a common origin in the\ndistant past. From this system of worldlines Weyl derived a common \ncosmic time. On the basis of his postulate, Weyl (1923c, Appendix \nIII) was also the first to show that there is an approximately \nlinear relation between the redshift of galactic spectra and\ndistance. Weyl had basically discovered Hubble’s Law six \nyears prior to Hubble’s formulation of it in 1929. Another \ncontribution to cosmology is Weyl’s (1919b) spherically symmetric \nstatic exact solution to Einstein’s \n linearized[66]\n field equations.  \n\nThere are essentially two ways to understand Mach’s Principle: (1) \nMach’s Principle rejects the absolute character of the inertial \nstructure of spacetime, and (2) Mach’s Principle rejects the inertial\nstructure of spacetime per se. Version (2) might be \ncharacterized as Leibnizian relativity or body \nrelationalism; that is, one understands by relative motion the \nmotion of bodies with respect only to other observable \nbodies or observable bodily reference frames. The \nrelative motion of a body with respect to absolute space or to the \ninertial structure of space (Newton) or spacetime is ruled out on \nepistemological and/or metaphysical grounds.  \n\nIn the context of his general theory of relativity, what Einstein is\nobjecting to in Newtonian Mechanics, and by implication, the theory of\nspecial relativity, is the absolute character of the inertial\nstructure; he is not asserting its fictitious character. That\nis, the general theory of relativity incorporates Mach’s\nPrinciple as expressed in version (1) by treating the inertial\nstructure as dynamical and not as absolute.  \n\nHowever, Einstein also tried to extend and generalize the special\ntheory of relativity by incorporating version (2) of Mach’s\nPrinciple into the general theory of relativity. Einstein was deeply\ninfluenced by Mach’s empiricist programme and accepted\nMach’s insistence on the primacy of observable facts of\nexperience: only observable facts of experience may be invoked to\naccount for the phenomena of motion. As a consequence, Einstein\nrestricted the concept of relative motions to relative motions between\nbodies. Newton thought that the plane of Foucault’s pendulum\nremains aligned with respect to absolute space. Since the fixed stars\nare at rest with respect to absolute space the plane of\nFoucault’s pendulum remains aligned to them as well, and rotates\nrelative to the earth. But according to Einstein, Newton’s\nintermediary notion of absolute space is as questionable as it is\nunnecessary in explaining the behaviour of Foucault’s\npendulum. Not absolute space, but the actually existing masses of the\nfixed stars of the whole cosmos guide the plane of Foucault’s\npendulum.  \n\nEinstein (1916) argued that the general theory of relativity removes \nfrom the special theory of relativity and Newton’s theory an inherent\nepistemological defect. The latter is brought to light by Mach’s \nparadox, namely, Einstein’s example of two fluid bodies, \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\), which are in constant relative rotation about a \ncommon axis. With regard to the extent to which each of the spheres \nbulges at its equator, infinitely many different states are possible \nalthough the relative rotation of the two bodies is the same in every\ncase. Einstein considered the case in which \\(A\\) is a sphere and \n\\(B\\) is an oblate spheroid. The paradox consists in the fact that\nthere is no readily discernible reason that accounts for the fact \nthat one of the bodies bulges and the other does not. According to \nEinstein, an epistemological satisfactory solution to this paradox \nmust be based on ‘an observable fact of experience’. \nEinstein wanted to implement a Leibnizian-Machian relational \nconception of motion according to which all motion is to be \ninterpreted as the motion of some bodies in relation to other bodies.\nEinstein wished to extend the body-relative concept of uniform \ninertial motion to the concept of a body-relative accelerated motion.\n \n\nWeyl was very critical of Einstein’s attempt to incorporate version \n(2) of Mach’s Principle into the theory of general relativity and \nrelativistic cosmology because he considered the Leibnizian-Machian \nrelational conception of motion—according to which all\nmotion is to be interpreted as the motion of some bodies in relation \nto other bodies—to be an incoherent notion within the context \nof the general theory of relativity.  \n\nIn a paper entitled Massenträgheit und \nKosmos. Ein Dialog [Inertial Mass and Cosmos. A \nDialogue] Weyl (1924b) articulates his overall position on the \nconcept of motion and the role of Mach’s Principle in general \nrelativity and \n cosmology.[67]\n Weyl defines Mach’s Principle as follows:  \nM (Mach’s Principle):\nThe inertia of a body is determined through the interaction of all the masses in the universe.\n \n\nWeyl (1924b) then makes the observation that the kinematic \nprinciple of relative motion is by itself without any content, \nunless one also makes the additional physical causal assumption that  \nC (Physical Causality):\nAll events or processes are uniquely causally determined through matter, that is, through charge, mass and the state of motion of the elementary particles of \n matter.[68] \n\nThe underlying motivation for assumption \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) of physical\ncausality is essentially Mach’s empiricist programme, namely,\nMach’s insistence on the primacy of observable facts of\nexperience. Addressing Einstein’s formulation of\nMach’s paradox, Weyl (1924b) says: Only if we conjoin\nthe kinematic principle of relative motion with the physical\nassumption \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) does it appear groundless or impossible on\nthe basis of the kinematic principle that in the absence of any\nexternal forces a stationary body of fluid has the form of a sphere\n“at rest”, while on the other hand it has the form of a\n“rotating” flattened ellipsoid. Weyl rejects principle\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) of physical causality because he denies the feasibility\nof \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) (Mach’s Principle), as defined above, on \\(a\\)\n priori[69]\n grounds. According to Weyl (1924b)  \nA:\nThe concept of relative motion of several isolated bodies with respect\nto each other is as untenable according to the theory of general\nrelativity as is the concept of absolute motion of a single body.\n \n\nWeyl notes that what we seem to observe as the rotation of the stars,\nis in reality not the rotation of the stars themselves but the \nrotation of the “star compass” [Sternenkompass] which \nconsists of light signals from the stars that meet our eyes at our \npresent location from a certain direction. It is crucial, Weyl \nreminds us, to be cognisant of the existence of the metric field \nbetween the stars and our eyes. This metric field determines the \npropagation of light, and, like the electromagnetic field, it is \ncapable of change and variation. Weyl (1924b) says that “the \nmetric field is no less important for the direction in which I see \nthe star then is the location of the star itself.” How is it \npossible, Weyl asks, to compare within the context of the general \ntheory of relativity, the state of motions of two separate bodies? Of\ncourse, Weyl notes, prior to the general theory of relativity, during\nMach’s time, one could rely on a rigid frame of reference such as the\nearth, and indefinitely extend such a frame throughout space. One \ncould then postulate the relative motion of the stars with respect to\nthis frame. However, under the hands of Einstein the coordinate \nsystem has lost its rigidity to such a degree, that it can always \n“cling to the motion of all bodies simultaneously”; that \nis, whatever the motions of the bodies are, there exists a coordinate\nsystem such that all bodies are at rest with respect to that \ncoordinate system. Weyl then clarifies and illustrates the above with\nthe plasticine example, which Weyl (1949a, 105) elsewhere describes \nas follows:  \n\nIncidentally, without a world structure the concept of relative \nmotion of several bodies has, as the postulate of general relativity \nshows, no more foundation than the concept of absolute motion of a \nsingle body. Let us imagine the four-dimensional world as a mass of \nplasticine traversed by individual fibers, the world lines of the \nmaterial particles. Except for the condition that no two world lines \nintersect, their pattern may be arbitrarily given. The plasticine can\nthen be continuously deformed so that not only one but all fibers \nbecome vertical straight lines. Thus no solution of the problem is \npossible as long as in adherence to the tendencies of Huyghens and \nMach one disregards the structure of the world. But once the inertial\nstructure of the world is accepted as the cause for the dynamical \ninequivalence of motions, we recognize clearly why the situation \nappeared so unsatisfactory. … Hence the solution is attained \nas soon as we dare to acknowledge the inertial structure as a \nreal thing that not only exerts effects upon matter but in \nturn suffers such effects. Figure 8:\nWeyl’s plasticine example \n\nApplying these considerations to the fixed stars and assuming that it\nis possible that the (conformal) metrical field which determines the \ncones of light propagation (light cones) at each point of the \nplasticine, is carried along by the continuous transformation of the \nplasticine, then both the earth and the fixed stars will be at rest \nwith respect to the plasticine’s coordinate system. Yet despite this \nthe “star compass” is rotating with respect to the earth,\nexactly as we observe!  \n\nEmploying the concept of the microsymmetry group (definition 4.1), \nColeman and Korté (1982) have analyzed Weyl’s plasticine \nexample in the following way: Consider a space-time manifold equipped\nonly with a differentiable structure, the plasticine of Weyl’s \nexample. Then our spacetime does not have an affine, conformal, \nprojective or metric structure defined on it. In such a world it is \npossible do define curves and paths; however, there are no preferred \ncurves or paths. Since there is only the differentiable structure, \none may apply any diffeomorphism; that is, all \ndiffeomorphisms preserve this structure; consequently, in the \nabsence of a post-differential-topological structure, the \nmicrosymmetry group at any event \\(p\\) is an infinite-parameter \ngroup isomorphic to the group of all invertible formal power series \nin four variables. If there is no post-differentiable topological \ngeometric field in the neighbourhood of a point, then all of these \ninfinite parameters may be chosen freely within rather broad limits. \nClearly then, given an infinite number of parameters, one can, as \nWeyl says, straighten out an arbitrary pattern of world lines \n(fibers) in the neighbourhood of any event. Now suppose that there \nexists a post-differentiable topological geometric field, namely, the\nprojective structure at any event of spacetime. Then the \nmicrosymmetry group that preserves that structure is a 20-parameter \nLie group (see Coleman and Korté (1981)). Thus instead of an \ninfinity of degrees of freedom, only twenty degrees of freedom may be\nused to actively deform the neighbouring region of spacetime. The \nfact that only a finite number of parameter are available prevents an\narbitrary realignment of the worldlines of material bodies in the \nneighbourhood of any given event.  \n\nOther post-differential topological geometrical field structures are \nsimilarly restrictive. For example, the microsymmetry group of the \nconformal structure, which determines the causal structure of \nspacetime, permits 7 degrees of freedom (6 Lorentz transformations \nand a dilatation), and permits four more degrees of freedom in second \norder. Consequently, the existence of the conformal metrical field \nwhich determines at each point the cones of light propagation would \nprevent an arbitrary realignment of light-like fibers, that is, it \nwould be impossible to realign the earth and the fixed stars such \nthat both are at rest with the coordinate system of the plasticine.  \n\nWeyl’s plasticine example shows that the Leibnizian-Machian view of \nrelative motion, namely the view according to which all motion must \nbe defined as motion relative to bodies, is self-defeating in the \ngeneral theory of relativity. The fact that a stationary, homogeneous\nelastic sphere will, when set in rotation, bulge at the equator and \nflatten at the poles is, according to Weyl (1924b), to be accounted \nfor in the following way. The complete physical system consisting of \nboth the body and the local inertial-gravitational field is not the \nsame in the two situations. The cause of the effect is the state of \nmotion of the body with respect to the local \ninertial-gravitational field, the guiding field, and is not, indeed \nas Weyl’s plasticine example shows, cannot be the state of motion of \nthe body relative to other bodies. To attribute the effect as \nEinstein and Mach did to the rotation of the body with respect to the\nother bodies in the universe is, according to Weyl, to \nendorse a remnant of the unjustified monopoly of the older body \nontology, namely, the sovereign right of material bodies to play the \nrole of physically real and acceptable causal \n agents.[70] \n\nWeyl’s view that there must be an inertial structure field \non spacetime, which governs material bodies in free \nmotion, follows from the mathematical nature of the \ncoordinate-transformation laws for acceleration. In a world equipped \nwith only a differential structure, it is possible to do calculus; \none can define curves and paths and differentiate, etc. However, as \nwas already pointed out, in such a world, the world of Weyl’s \nplasticine example, there would be no preferred curves or paths. \nConsequently, the motion of material bodies would not be\npredictable. However, experience overwhelmingly indicates that \nthe acceleration of a massive body cannot be freely chosen. In \nparticular, consider a simple type of particle, a monopole \n(unstructured) particle. Experience overwhelmingly tells us that such\na particle is characterized by the fact that at any event on its \nworld line, its velocity at that event is sufficient to determine its\nacceleration at that event. Predictability of motion, therefore, \nentails that corresponding to every type of massive monopole, there \nexists a geometric structure field, or what Weyl calls a \nStrukturfeld that governs the motion of that type of \nparticle. The basic reason which explains this brute fact of \nexperience is a simple mathematical fact about how the acceleration \nof bodies transforms under a coordinate transformation. Moreover, \nthis simple mathematical fact, involving no more than the basic \ntechniques of partial differentiation, holds in all relativistic, \nnon-relativistic, curved or flat, dynamic or non-dynamic spacetime \ntheories that are based on a local differential topological \nstructure, the minimal structure required for the possibility of \nassigning arbitrary local coordinates on a differential manifold.  \nTransformation law for acceleration:\nThe transformation law for acceleration is linear, but is not\nhomogeneous in the acceleration variable. \n\nAs an example consider the transformation laws for the 4-velocity and\nthe 4-acceleration. Recall that a curve in the\nfour-dimensional spacetime manifold \\(M\\) is a map \\(\\gamma :\n\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow M\\). For convenience we restrict our attention\nto those curves which satisfy \\(\\gamma(0) = p\\). If we set\n\\(\\gamma^{i} = x^{i} \\circ \\gamma(0)\\), then the components of the\n4-velocity and 4-acceleration at \\(p \\in M\\) are respectively given\nby  \n\nThe transformation laws of the 4-velocity components\n\\(\\gamma^{i}_{1}\\) and of the 4-acceleration components\n\\(\\gamma^{i}_{2}\\) under a change of coordinate chart from\n\\((U,x)_{p}\\) to \\((\\overline{U}, \\overline{x})_p\\), follow from their\npointwise definition. From  \n\nwhere \\(\\overline{X}^{i} = \\overline{x}^i \\circ x^{- 1}\\), \none obtains the transformation law for the 4-velocity and the\n4-acceleration respectively:  \n\nThe \\(\\overline{X}^{i}_{j}\\) and \\(\\overline{X}^{i}_{jk}\\) denote the\nfirst and second partial derivatives of \\(\\overline{X}^{i}(x^{i})\\) at\n\\(x^{i} (p)\\), namely, \n\nThe expression \\(\\overline{X}^{i}_{jk}\\gamma^{\\,j}_{1}\\gamma^{k}_{1}\\) in \nequation (33) represents the inhomogeneous term of the transformation\nof the 4-acceleration. The inhomogeneity of the transformation law \nentails that a 4-acceleration that is zero with respect to one \ncoordinate system is not zero with respect to another coordinate \nsystem. This means that there does not exist a unique standard of \nzero 4-acceleration that is intrinsic to the differential topological\nstructure of spacetime. Moreover, even the difference of the \n4-accelerations of two bodies at the same spacetime point has no \nabsolute meaning, unless their 4-velocities happen to be the same. \nThis shows that while the differential topological structure of \nspacetime gives us sufficient structure to do calculus and to derive \nthe transformation laws for 4-velocities and 4-accelerations by way \nof simple differentiation, it does not provide sufficient structure \nwith which to determine a standard of zero 4-acceleration. Therefore,\nas Weyl repeatedly emphasized, no solution to the problem of motion \nis possible, unless “we dare to acknowledge the \ninertial structure as a real thing that not only exerts \neffects upon matter but in turn suffers such effects”. In \nother words there must exist a structure in addition to the \ndifferential topological structure in the form of a geometric \nstructure field, or in Weyl’s words, geometrisches \nStrukturfeld, which constitutes the inertial structure of \nspacetime, and which provides the standard of zero 4-acceleration. \nSince this field provides the standard of zero 4-acceleration we can \ncall it a geodesic 4-acceleration field, or simply, geodesic \nacceleration field. A particle in free motion is one that is\nexclusively governed by this geodesic acceleration field.  \n\nAn acceleration field, geodesic or non-geodesic, can be constructed \nin the following way. Since the terms that are independent of the \n4-acceleration depend on both the spacetime location and on the \ncorresponding 4-velocity of the particle, it is necessary to specify \na geometric field standard for zero 4-acceleration that also\ndepends on those independent variables.  \n\nThe transformation law for a 4-acceleration field can be obtained \nfrom (33) by replacing \n\\(\\overline{\\gamma}^{i}_{2}\\) by \n\\(\\overline{A}^{i}_{2}(\\overline{x}^{i},\\overline{\\gamma}^{i}_{1})\\)\nand \\(\\gamma^{j}_{2}\\) by \\(A^{j}_{2}(x^{i}, \\gamma^{i}_{1}\\)) to yield \n\nThe important special case for which the function \\(A^{i}_{2}(x^{i}, \n\\gamma^{i}_{1})\\) is a geodesic 4-acceleration field \ncorresponds to the affine structure of spacetime. For this special \ncase the function \\(A^{i}_{2}(x^{i}, \\gamma^{i}_{1}\\)) \nis denoted by \\(\\Gamma^{i}_{2}(x^{i}, \\gamma^{i}_{1}\\)) and is given\nby  \n\nThe familiar transformation law for the affine structure (geodesic \n4-acceleration field) is then given by  \n\nNote that the inhomogeneous term \n\\(\\overline{X}^{i}_{jk}\\gamma^{j}_{1}\\gamma^{k}_{1}\\) of the \ngeodesic 4-acceleration field is identical to the inhomogeneous term \nof the transformation law (33) for the 4-acceleration of body motion.\nThe differences  \n\nthen transform linearly and homogeneously; consequently, the \nvanishing or non-vanishing of body accelerations relative to the \nstandard of zero acceleration provided by the geodesic 4-acceleration\nfield (the affine structure), is coordinate independent. That is, the\n4-accelerations of bodies and the corresponding 4-forces, are \ntensorial quantities in concordance with experience.  \n\nThe above argument for the necessity of geometric fields also holds\nfor 3-velocity and 3-acceleration, denoted respectively by\n\\(\\xi^{\\alpha}_{1}\\) and \\(\\xi^{\\alpha}_{2}\\).  The transformation law\nfor the 3-acceleration is much more complicated than that of the\n4-acceleration. However, analogous to the case of 4-acceleration, the\ntransformation law of 3-acceleration is linear and is inhomogeneous in\nthe 3-acceleration variable \\(\\xi^{\\alpha}_{2}\\).  Consequently, there\ndoes not exist a unique standard of zero 3-acceleration that is\nintrinsic to the differential topological structure of spacetime. The\nstandard of zero 3-acceleration must be provided by a geodesic\n3-acceleration field or geodesic directing field, or what Weyl calls\nthe guiding field. The guiding field is also referred to as the\nprojective structure of spacetime and is denoted by\n\\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}_{2}(x^{i}, \\xi^{\\alpha}_{1}\\)). It is a function of\nspacetime location and the 3-velocity, both variables of which are\nindependent of the 3-acceleration, as is required. Since the\ntransformation law of the projective structure\n\\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}_{2}(x^{i}, \\xi^{\\alpha}_{1}\\)) has the same\ninhomogeneous form as the 3-acceleration \\(\\xi^{\\alpha}_{2}\\), the\ndifference  \n\nalso transforms linearly and homogeneously.  \n\nThe components \\(\\gamma^{i}_{2}\\) and \\(\\xi^{\\alpha}_{2}\\) of the \n4-acceleration and 3-acceleration can be thought of as the dynamic \ndescriptors of a material body. On the other hand, the components \n\\(\\Gamma^{i}_{2}(x^{i},\\gamma^{i}_{1}\\)) and \n\\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}_{2}(x^{i}, \\xi^{\\alpha}_{1}\\)) of the \ngeodesic acceleration field, and the geodesic directing field, \nrespectively, are field quantities. The differences  \n\nand  \n\ndenote the components of a coordinate independent field-body\n\n relation.[71] \n\nWeyl (1924b) remarks:  \n\nWe have known since Galileo and Newton, that the motion of a body \ninvolves an inherent struggle between inertia and force. According to\nthe old view, the inertial tendency of persistence, the \n“guidance”, which gives a body its natural inertial \nmotion, is based on a formal geometric structure of the spacetime \n(uniform motion in a straight line) which resides once and for all in\nspacetime independently of any natural processes. This assumption \nEinstein rejects; because whatever exerts as powerful effects as \ninertia—for example, in opposition to the molecular forces of \ntwo colliding trains it rips apart their freight cars—must be \nsomething real which itself suffers effect from matter. Moreover, \nEinstein recognized that the guiding field’s variability and \ndependence on matter is revealed in gravitational effects. Therefore,\nthe dualism between guidance and force is maintained; but  \n\n(G) Guidance is a physical field, like the \nelectromagnetic field, which stands in mutual interaction \nwith matter. Gravitation belongs to the guiding field and not to \nforce. Only thus is it possible to explain the equivalence \nbetween inertial and gravitational mass. \n\nTo move from the old conception to the new conception (G) means, \naccording to Weyl (1924b)  \n\nto replace the geometric difference between uniform and \naccelerated motion with the dynamic difference between \nguidance and force. Opponents of Einstein asked the question: \nSince the church tower receives a jolt in its motion relative to the \ntrain just as the train receives a jolt in its motion relative to the\nchurch tower, why does the train become a wreckage and not the church\ntower which it passes? Common sense would answer: because the train \nis ripped out of the pathway of the guiding field, but the church \ntower is not. … As long as one ignores the guiding field one \ncan neither speak of absolute nor of relative motion; only if one \ngives due consideration to the guiding field does the concept of \nmotion acquire content. The theory of relativity, correctly \nunderstood, does not eliminate absolute motion in favour of relative \nmotion, rather it eliminates the kinematic concept of motion and \nreplaces it with a dynamic one. The worldview for which Galileo \nfought is not undermined by it [relativity]; to the contrary, it is \nmore concretely interpreted. \n\nIt is now possible to provide a reformulation of Newton’s laws of \nmotion which explicitly takes account of Weyl’s \nfield-body-relationalist spacetime ontology, and his analysis of the \nconcept of motion. The law of inertia is an empirically verifiable \n statement[72]\n which says  \n\nThe Law of Inertia: There exists on spacetime a \nunique projective structure \\(\\Pi_{2}\\) or equivalently, a \nunique geodesic directing field \\(\\Pi_{2}\\). \n\nFree motion is defined with reference to the projective \nstructure \\(\\Pi_{2}\\) as follows:  \n\nDefinition of Free Motion: A possible or actual \nmaterial body is in a state of free motion during any part of its \nhistory just in case its motion is exclusively governed by the \ngeodesic directing field (projective structure), that is, just in \ncase the corresponding segment of its world path is a solution path \nof the differential equation determined by the unique projective \nstructure of spacetime. \n\nNewton’s second law of motion may be reformulated as follows:  \n\nThe Law of Motion: With respect to any coordinate \nsystem, the world line path of a possible or actual material body \nsatisfies an equation of the form  \n\nwhere \\(m\\) is a scalar constant characteristic of the material \nbody called its inertial mass, and \n\\(F^{\\alpha}(x^{i},\\xi^{\\alpha}_{1}\\)) is the \n3-force acting on the body. \n\nTo emphasize, the Law of Inertia and the Law of Motion, as formulated\nabove, apply to all, relativistic or non-relativistic, \ncurved or flat, dynamic or non-dynamic, spacetime theories. The \nreason for the general character of these laws consists in the fact \nthat they require for their formulation only the local differential \ntopological structure of spacetime, a structure which is common to \nall spacetime theories. In addition, as was noted earlier in \n§4.2, the affine and projective spacetime structures are \nG-structures. Consequently, they may be flat or non-flat; but \nthey can never vanish. In theories prior to the advent of \ngeneral relativity, the affine and projective structures were flat. \nIt was common practice, however, to use coordinate systems that were\nadapted to these flat G-structures. And since in such \nadapted coordinate systems the components of the affine and \nprojective structures vanish, it was difficult to recognize and to \nappreciate the existence of these structures, and their important role\nin providing a coherent account of motion.  \n\nWe saw that Weyl forcefully advocated a field-body ontological \ndualism, according to which matter and the guiding field are \nindependent physical realities that causally interact with each \nother: matter uniquely generates the various states of the guiding \nfield, and the guiding field in turn acts on matter.  \n\nWeyl did not always subscribe to this ontological dualist position. \nFor a short period, from 1918 to 1920, he advocated a pure field \ntheory of matter , developed in 1912 by Gustav Mie, in the context\nof Einstein’s special theory of relativity:  \nPure Field Theory of Matter:\nThe physical field has an independent reality that is not reducible to\nmatter; rather, the physical field is constitutive of all matter in\nthe sense that the mass (quantity of matter) of a material particle,\nsuch as an electron, consists of a large field energy that is\nconcentrated in a very small region of spacetime. \n\nMie’s theory of matter is akin to the traditional geometric\nview of matter: matter is passive and pure \nextension. Weyl (1921b) remarks that he adopted the \nstandpoint of the classical pure field theory of matter in the first \nthree editions of Weyl (1923b) because of its beauty and unity, but \nthen gave it up. Weyl (1931a) points out in the Rouse Ball Lecture \nthat since the theory of general relativity geometrized a physical \nentity, the gravitational field, it was natural to try to \ngeometrize the whole of physics. Prior to the advent of \nquantum physics one was justified in regarding gravitation and \nelectromagnetism as the only basic entities of nature and to seek \ntheir unification by geometrizing both. One could hope, following the\nexample of Gustav Mie, to construct elementary material particles as \nknots of energy in the gravitational-electromagnetic field, \nthat is, tiny demarcated regions in which the field magnitudes attain\nvery high values.  \n\nAlready in a letter to Felix \n Klein,[73]\n toward the end of 1920, Weyl indicated that he had finally freed \nhimself completely from Mie’s theory of matter. It now appeared to \nhim that the classical field theory of matter is not the key to \nreality. In the Rouse Ball Lecture Weyl adduces two reasons for this.\n \n\nFirst, due to quantum mechanics, there are, in addition to \nelectromagnetic waves, matter waves (Materiewellen)\nrepresented by Schrödinger’s wave function \\(\\psi\\). And Pauli and \nDirac recognized that \\(\\psi\\) is not a scalar but a magnitude with \nseveral components. Thus, from the point of view of the classical \nfield theory of matter not two but three entities would have to be \nunified. Moreover, given the transformation properties of the wave \nfunction, Weyl says it is certain that the magnitude \\(\\psi\\) cannot be \nreduced to gravitation or electromagnetism. Weyl saw clearly, that \nthis geometric view of matter or physics—which to a \ncertain extent had also motivated his earlier construction and manner\nof presentation of a pure infinitesimal geometry—was\nuntenable in light of the new developments in atomic physics.  \n\nThe second reason, Weyl says, consists in the radical new \ninterpretation of the wave function, which replaces the concept of \nintensity with that of probability. It is only through such a \nstatistical interpretation that the corpuscular and atomistic aspect \nof nature is properly recognized. Instead of a geometric \ntreatment of the classical field theory of matter, the new \nquantum theory called for a statistical treatment of \n matter.[74]\n Already in 1920, Weyl (1920) addressed the relationship between \ncausal and statistical approaches to \n physics.[75] \n\nThe theory of general relativity, as well as early developments in \natomic physics, clearly tell us, Weyl (1921b) suggests, that matter \nuniquely determines the field, and that there exist deeper underlying\nphysical laws with which modern physics, such as quantum theory, is \nconcerned, which specify “how the field is affected by \nmatter”. That is, experience tells us that matter plays the \nrole of a causal agent which uniquely determines the field, \nand which therefore has an independent physical reality that cannot \nbe reduced to the field on which it acts. Weyl (1921b, 1924e) refers \nto his theory of matter as the Agenstheorie der Materie \n(literally, agent-theory of matter):  \nMatter-Field Dualism (Weyl’s Agens Theory of Matter):\nMatter and field are independent physical realities that causally\ninteract with each other: matter uniquely generates the various states\nof the field, and the field in turn acts on matter. To excite the field\nis the essential primary function of matter. The field’s function is\nto respond to the action of matter and is thus secondary. The\nsecondary role of the field is to transmit effects (from body to body)\ncaused by matter, thereby in return affecting matter. \n\nThe view, that matter uniquely determines the field, \nwas a necessary postulate of an opposing \nontological standpoint, according to Weyl. The postulate essentially says that Matter is the only thing which is \ngenuinely real. According to this ontological view, held to a certain degree\nby the younger Einstein and others who advocated a form of Machian \nempiricism, the field is relegated to play the role of a feeble \nextensive medium which transmits effects from body to \n body.[76]\nAccording to this opposing ontological view, the field laws, that is, certain implicit differential \nconnections between the various possible states of the field, on the \nbasis of which the field alone is capable of transmitting effects \ncaused by matter, can essentially have no more significance for \nreality than the laws of geometry could, according to earlier views. \nBut as we saw earlier, Weyl held that no satisfactory solution can be given to \nthe problem of motion as long as we adhere to the Einstein-Machian \nempiricist position that relegates the field to the role of a feeble\nextensive medium, and which does not acknowledge that the guiding \nfield is physically real. However, from the standpoint of Weyl’s agens theory of \nmatter, a satisfactory answer to Mach’s paradox can be given: \nthe reason why a stationary, homogeneous elastic sphere will bulge at the equator and flatten at the poles, when \nset in rotation, is \ndue to the fact that the complete physical system consisting of both \nthe body and the guiding field, differs in the rotating case\nfrom the stationary one. The local guiding field is the real cause of\nthe inertial forces.  \n\nWeyl lists two reasons in support for his agens theory of matter. \nFirst, the agens theory of matter is the only theory which coheres \nwith the basic experiences of life and physics: matter generates the \nfield and all our actions ultimately involve matter. For example, \nonly through matter can we change the field. Secondly, in order to \nunderstand the fact of the existence of charged material particles, \nwe have two possibilities: either we follow Mie and adopt a pure \nfield theory of matter, or we elevate the ontological status of \nmatter and regard it as a real singularity of the field and \nnot merely as a high concentration of field energy in a tiny region \nof spacetime. Since Mie’s approach is necessarily limited to the \nframework of the theory of special relativity, and since there is no \nroom in the general theory of relativity for a generalization and \nmodification of the classical field laws, as envisaged by Mie in the \ncontext of the special theory of relativity, Weyl adopted the second \npossibility. He was motivated to do so by his recognition that the \nfield equation of an electron at rest contains a finite mass term \n\\(m\\) that appears to have nothing to do with the energy of the \nassociated field. Weyl’s subsequent analysis of mass in terms of \nelectromagnetic field energy provided a definition of mass and a \nderivation of the basic equations of mechanics, and led Weyl to the \ninvention of the topological idea of wormholes in spacetime.\nWeyl did not use the term ‘wormholes’; it was John \nWheeler who later coined the term ‘wormhole’ in 1957. \nWeyl spoke of one-dimensional tubes instead. \n“Inside” these tubes no space exists, and their \nboundaries are, analogous to infinite distance, inaccessible; they do\nnot belong to the field. In a chapter entitled “Hermann Weyl \nand the Unity of Knowledge” Wheeler (1994) says,  \n\nAnother insight Weyl gave us on the nature of electricity is \ntopological in character and dates from 1924. We still do not know \nhow to assess it properly or how to fit it into the scheme of \nphysics, although with each passing decade it receives more \nattention. The idea is simple. Wormholes thread through space as air \nchannels through Swiss cheese. Electricity is not electricity. \nElectricity is electric lines of force trapped in the topology of \nspace. \n\nA year after Einstein (1916) had established the field equations of \nhis new general theory of relativity, Einstein (1917) applied his \ntheory for the first time to cosmology. In doing so, Einstein made \nseveral assumptions:  \nCosmological Principle: Like Newton, Einstein \nassumed that the universe is homogeneous and \nisotropic in its distribution of matter. \nStatic Universe: Einstein assumed, as did \nNewton and most cosmologists at that time, that the universe is \nstatic on the large scale. \nMach’s Principle: Einstein believed that the \nmetric field is completely determined through the masses of bodies. \nThe metric field is determined through the energy-momentum tensor of \nthe field equations. \n\nThe cosmological principle continuous to play an important \nrole in cosmological modelling to this day. However, Einstein’s \nsecond assumption that the universe is static was in conflict with \nhis field equations, which permitted models of the universe that were\nhomogeneous and isotropic, but not static. In this regard, \nEinstein’s difficulties were essentially the same that Newton had \nfaced: A static Newtonian model involving an infinite container with \nan infinite number of stars was unstable; that is, local regions \nwould collapse under gravity. Because Einstein was committed to \nMach’s Principle he faced a problem concerning the boundary \nconditions for infinite space containing finite \namount of \n matter.[77]\n Einstein recognized that it was impossible to choose boundary \nconditions such that the ten potentials of the metric \n\\(g_{ij}\\) are completely determined by the \nenergy-momentum tensor \\(T_{ij}\\), as required by \nMach’s Principle. That is, the boundary conditions “flat at \ninfinity” entail a global inertial frame that\nis tied to empty flat space at infinity, and hence is \nunrelated to the mass-energy content of space, contrary to Mach’s \nPrinciple, according to which only mass-energy can influence\ninertia.  \n\nEinstein thought that he could solve the difficulties of an unstable \nnon-static universe with boundary conditions at infinity that do not \nsatisfy Mach’s Principle, by introducing the cosmological term \n\\(\\Lambda\\) into his field equations. He showed that for positive values\nof the cosmological constant, his modified field equation admitted a \nsolution for a \n static[78]\n universe in which space is curved, unbounded and finite; that is, \nspace is a hyper surface of a sphere in four \ndimensions. Einstein’s spatially closed universe is often \nreferred to as Einstein’s “cylinder” world: with two of \nthe spatial dimensions suppressed, the model universe can be pictured\nas a cylinder where the radius \\(A\\) represents the space and the \naxis the time coordinate.  Figure 9:\nEinstein Universe \n\nAccording to Einstein’s Machian convictions, since inertia is \ndetermined only by matter, there can be no inertial structure or \nfield in the absence of matter. Consequently, it is impossible, \nEinstein conjectured, to find a solution to the field \nequations—that is, to determine the metric \n\\(g_{ij}\\)—if the energy-momentum tensor \n\\(T_{ij}\\) representing the mass-energy content of \nthe universe is zero. The non-existence of ‘vacuum \nsolutions’ for a static universe demonstrated, Einstein \nthought, that Mach’s Principle had been successfully incorporated \ninto his theory of general relativity. Einstein also believed that \nhis solution was unique because of the assumptions of isotropy and \n homogeneity.[79] \n\nHowever, Einstein was mistaken. In 1917, the Dutch astronomer Willem \nde Sitter published another solution to Einstein’s field equations \ncontaining the cosmological constant. De Sitter’s solution showed \nthat Einstein’s solution is not a unique solution of his field \nequations. In addition, since de Sitter’s universe is empty it \nprovided a direct counter-example to Einstein’s hope that Mach’s \nPrinciple had been successfully incorporated into his \n theory.[80] \n\nThere are cosmologists who, like Einstein, are favourably disposed \ntowards some version of Mach’s Principle, and who believe that the \nlocal laws, which are satisfied by various physical fields, are \ndetermined by the large scale structure of the universe. On the other\nhand, there are those cosmologists who, like Weyl, take a \nconservative approach; they take empirically confirmed local \nlaws and investigate what these laws might imply about the \nuniverse as a whole. Our understanding of the large scale structure \nof the universe, Weyl emphasized, must be based on theories and \nprinciples which are verified locally. Einstein’s general theory is a\nlocal field theory; like electromagnetism, it is a close\naction \n theory.[81]\n Weyl (1924b) says:  \n\nIt appears to me that one can grasp the concrete physical content of \nthe theory of relativity without taking a position regarding the \ncausal relationship between the masses of the universe and inertia. \n\nAnd, referring to (G), (see citation at the end of §4.4.3), \nwhich says that “Guidance is a physical field, like \nthe electromagnetic field, which stands in mutual \ninteraction with matter. Gravitation belongs to the guiding field \nand not to force”, Weyl (1924b) says:  \n\nWhat I have so far presented and briefly formulated in the two \nsentences of G, that alone impacts on physics and underlies the \nactual individual investigations of problems of the theory of \nrelativity. Mach’s Principle, according to which the fixed stars \nintervene with mysterious power in earthly events, goes far beyond \nthis [G] and is until now pure speculation; it merely has \ncosmological significance and does not become important for natural \nscience until astronomical observations reach the totality of the \ncosmos [Weltganze], and not merely one island of stars \n[Sterneninsel]. We could leave the question unanswered if I did not \nhave to admit that it is tempting to construct, on the basis of the \ntheory of relativity, a picture of the totality of the cosmos. \n\nWeyl’s claim is that because general relativity is an inherently \nlocal field theory, its validity and soundness is \nessentially independent of global cosmological considerations. \nHowever, if we wish to introduce such global considerations into our \nlocal physics, then we can do so only on the basis of additional \nassumptions, such as, for example, the Cosmological Principle, \nalready mentioned. In 1923 Weyl (1923b, §39) introduced another \ncosmological assumption, namely, the so-called Weyl \nPostulate. De Sitter’s solution and the new astronomical \ndiscoveries in the early 1920’s, which suggested that the universe is\nnot static but expanding, led to a drastic change in thinking about \nthe nature of the universe and an increased scepticism towards \nEinstein’s model of a static universe. In 1923, Weyl (1923b, \n§39) notes in the fifth edition of Raum Zeit Materie, \nthat despite its attractiveness, Einstein’s cosmology suffers from \nserious defects. Weyl begins by pointing out that spectroscopic \nresults indicate that the stars have an age. Weyl continued,  \n\nall our experiences about the distribution of stars show that the \npresent state of the starry sky has nothing to do with a \n“statistical final state.” The small velocities \nof the stars is due to a common origin rather than some equilibrium; \nincidentally, it appears, based on observation, that the more distant\nconfigurations are from each other, the greater the velocities on \naverage. Instead of uniform distribution of matter, astronomical \nfacts lead rather to the view that individual clouds of stars glide \nby in vast empty space. \n\nWeyl further points out that de Sitter showed that Einstein’s \ncosmological equations of gravity have “a very simple regular \nsolution” and that an empty spacetime, namely, “a \nmetrically homogeneous spacetime of non-vanishing curvature,” \nis compatible with these equations after all. Weyl says that de \nSitter’s solution, which on the whole is not static, forces us to \nabandon our predilection for a static universe.  \n\nThe Einstein and the de Sitter universe are both spacetimes with two \nseparate fringes, the infinitely remote past and the infinitely \nremote future. Dropping two of its spatial dimensions we imagine \nEinstein’s universe as the surface of a straight cylinder of a \ncertain radius and de Sitter’s universe as a one sheeted hyperboloid.\nBoth surfaces are surfaces of infinite extent in both directions. \nBoth the Einstein universe and the de Sitter universe spread from the\neternal past to the eternal future. However, unlike de Sitter’s \nuniverse, in Einstein’s universe “the metrical relations are \nsuch that the light cone issuing from a world point is folded back \nupon itself an infinite number of times. An observer should therefore\nsee infinitely many images of a star, showing him the star in states \nbetween which an eon has elapsed, the time needed by the light to \ntravel around the sphere of the world.” Weyl (1930) says:  \n\n… I start from de Sitter’s solution: the world, according to \nits metric constitution, has the character of a four-dimensional \n“sphere” (hyperboloid)  \n\nin a five-dimensional quasi-euclidean space, with the line element  \n\nThe sphere has the same degree of metric homogeneity as the world of \nthe special theory of relativity, which can be conceived as a \nfour-dimensional “plane” in the same space. The plane, \nhowever, has only one connected infinitely distant \n“seam,” while it is the most prominent topological \nproperty of the sphere to be endowed with two—the infinitely \ndistant past and the infinitely distant future. In this sense one may\nsay that space is closed in de Sitter’s solution. On the other hand, \nhowever, it is distinguished from the well-known Einstein solution, \nwhich is based on a homogeneous distribution of mass, by the fact \nthat the null cone of future belonging to a world-point does not \noverlap with itself; in this causal sense, the de Sitter space is \nopen. \n\nOn this hyperboloid, a single star (nebula or galaxy, in later \ncontexts) \\(A\\), also called “observer” by Weyl, \ntraces a geodesic world line, and from each point of the star’s world\nline a light cone opens into the future and fills a region \\(D\\), \nwhich Weyl calls the domain of influence of the star. In de \nSitter’s cosmology this domain of influence covers only half of the \nhyperboloid and Weyl suggests that it is reasonable to assume that \nthis half of the hyperboloid corresponds to the real world.  Figure 10:\nDe Sitter’s hyperboloid with domain of influence \\(D\\) \ncovering half of the hyperboloid and world lines of stars. \n\nThere are innumerable stars or geodesics, according to Weyl, that \nhave the same domain of influence as the arbitrarily chosen star \n\\(A\\); they form, he says, a system that has been causally \ninterconnected since eternity. Such a system of causally \ninterconnected stars Weyl describes as stars of a common origin that \nlies in an infinitely remote past. The sheaf of world-lines of such a\nsystem of stars converges, in the direction of the infinitely remote \npast, on an infinitely small part of the total extent of the \nhyperboloid, and diverges in the direction of the future on an ever \nincreasing extent of the hyperboloid. Weyl’s choice of singling out a\nparticular sheaf of non-intersecting timelike geodesics as \nconstituting the cosmological substratum is the content of Weyl’s \nPostulate. Weyl (1923b, 295) says:  \n\nThe hypothesis is suggestive, that all the celestial bodies which we \nknow belong to such a single system; this would explain the small \nvelocities of the stars as a consequence of their common origin. \n\nThe transition from a static to a dynamic universe opens up the \npossibility of a disorderly universe where galaxies could collide, \nthat is, their world lines might intersect. Roughly speaking, Weyl’s \nPostulate states that the actual universe is an orderly universe. It \nsays that the world lines of the galaxies form a 3-sheaf of \n non-intersecting[82]\n geodesics orthogonal to layers of spacelike hypersurfaces. Figure 11:\nWeyl’s Postulate \n\nSince the relative velocities of matter is small in each collection \nof galaxies extending over an astronomical neighbourhood, one can \napproximate a “smeared-out” motion of the galaxies and \nintroduce a substratum or fluid which fills space \nand in which the galaxies move like “fundamental \n particles”.[83]\n Weyl’s postulate says that observers associated with this smeared-out\nmotion constitute a privileged class of observers of the universe. \nSince geodesics do not intersect, according to Weyl’s Postulate, \nthere exist one and only one geodesic which passes through each \nspacetime point. Consequently, matter possesses a unique velocity at \nany spacetime point. Therefore, the fluid may be regarded as a \nperfect fluid; and this is the essential content of Weyl’s \nPostulate.  \n\nSince the geodesics of the galaxies are orthogonal to a layer of\nspacelike hypersrfaces according to Weyl’s Postulate, one can\nintroduce coordinates \\((x^{0}, x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3})\\) such that the\nspacelike hypersurfaces are given by \\(x^{0} =\\) constant, and the\nspacelike coordinates \\(x^{\\alpha}\\) \\((\\alpha = 1, 2, 3)\\) are constant\nalong the geodesics of each galaxy. Therefore, the spacelike\ncoordinates \\(x^{\\alpha}\\) are co-moving coordinates along \nthe geodesics of each galaxy. The \northogonality condition permits a choice of the time coordinate \n\\(x^{0}\\) such that the metric or line element has the \nform  \n\nwhere \\(ct = x^{0}, x^{0}\\) is called the \ncosmic time, and \\(t\\) is the proper time of any\ngalaxy. The spacelike hypsersurfaces are therefore the surfaces of \nsimultaneity with respect to the cosmic time \\(x^{0}\\). \nThe Cosmological Principle in turn tells us that these hypersurfaces \nof simultaneity are homogeneous and isotropic.  \n\nIndependently, Robertson and Walker, were subsequently able to give a\nprecise mathematical derivation of the most general metric by \nassuming Weyl’s Postulate and the Cosmological Principle.  \n\nWeyl’s introduction of his Postulate made it possible for him to\nprovide the first satisfactory treatment of the cosmological\nredshift. Consider a light source, say a star \\(A\\), which emits\nmonochromatic light that travels along null geodesics \\(L, L',\\ldots\\)\nto an observer \\(O\\). Let \\(s\\) be the proper time of the light\nsource, and let \\(\\sigma\\) be the proper time of the observer\n\\(O\\). Then to every point \\(s\\) on the world line of the light source\n\\(A\\) there corresponds a point on the world line of the observer\n\\(O\\), namely, \\(\\sigma = \\sigma(s)\\).  Figure 12:\nA body or star \\(A\\) emits monochromatic light which travels along\nnull geodesics \\(L, L',\\ldots\\) to an observer \\(O\\). \n\nConsequently, if one of the generators of the light cone issuing from\n\\(A\\)’s world line at \\(A\\)’s proper time \n\\(s_{0}\\)—the null geodesic \\(L\\)—reaches \nobserver \\(O\\) at the observer’s proper time \n\\(\\sigma(s_{0})\\), then  \n\nTherefore, the frequency \\(\\nu_{A}\\) of the light that \nwould be measured by some hypothetical observer on \\(A\\) is \nrelated to the frequency \\(\\nu_{O}\\) measured on \\(O\\)\nby  \n\nAccording to Weyl (1923c) this relationship holds in arbitrary \nspacetimes and for arbitrary motions of source and observer. Weyl \n(1923b, Anhang III) then applied this relationship to de Sitter’s \nworld and showed, to lowest order, that the redshift is linear \nin distance; that is, Weyl theoretically derived, what was later\ncalled Hubble’s redshift law. Using Slipher’s \nredshift data Weyl estimated a Hubble constant six years \nprior to Hubble. Weyl (1923b, Anhang III) remarks:  \n\nIt is noteworthy that neither the elementary nor Einstein’s cosmology\nlead to such a redshift. Of course, one cannot claim today, that our \nexplanation hits the right mark, especially since the views about the\nnature and distance of the spiral nebulae are still very much in need\nof further clarification. \n\nIn 1933 Weyl gave a lecture in Göttingen in which Weyl (1934b) \nrecalls  \n\nAccording to the Doppler effect the receding motion of the stars is \nrevealed in a redshift of their spectral lines which is proportional \nto distance. In this form, where De Sitter’s solution of the \ngravitational equation is augmented by an assumption concerning the \nundisturbed motion of the stars, I had predicted the redshift in the \nyear 1923. \n\nDuring the period 1925–1926 Weyl published a sequence of \ngroundbreaking papers (Weyl (1925, 1926a,b,c)) in which he presented \na general theory of the representations and invariants of the \nclassical Lie groups. In these celebrated papers Weyl drew together \nI. Schur’s work on invariants and representations of the \n\\(n\\)-dimensional rotation group, and É. Cartan’s work on \nsemisimple Lie algebras. In doing so, Weyl utilized different fields \nof mathematics such as, tensor algebra, invariant theory, Riemann \nsurfaces and Hilbert’s theory of integral equations. Weyl himself \nconsidered these papers his greatest work in mathematics.  \n\nThe central role that group theoretic techniques played in Weyl’s \nanalysis of spacetime was one of several factors which led Weyl to \nhis general theory of the representations and invariants of the \nclassical Lie groups. It was in the context of Weyl’s investigation \nof the space-problem (see §4.2) that Weyl came to appreciate the\nvalue of group theory for investigating the mathematical and \nphilosophical foundations of physical theories in general, and for \ndealing with fundamental questions motivated by the general theory of\nrelativity, in particular.  \n\nA motivation of quite another sort, which led Weyl to his general \nrepresentation theory, was provided by Study when he attacked Weyl \nspecifically, as well as other unnamed individuals, by accusing them \n“of having neglected a rich cultural domain (namely, the theory\nof invariants), indeed of having completely ignored \n it”.[84]\n Weyl (1924c) replied immediately providing a new foundation for the \ntheory of invariants of the special linear groups \n\n\\(SL(n, \\mathbb{C})\\) and its most important subgroups, the special\northogonal group \\(SO(n, \\mathbb{C})\\) and the special symplectic group\n\\(SSp(\\bfrac{n}{2}, \\mathbb{C})\\) (for \\(n\\) even) based on algebraic\nidentities due to Capelli. In a footnote, Weyl (1924c) sarcastically\ninformed Study that “even if he [Weyl] had been as well versed\nas Study in the theory of invariants, he would not have used the\nsymbolic method in his book\nRaum, Zeit, Materie and even with the last breath of his \nlife would not have mentioned the algebraic completeness theorem for \ninvariant theory”. Weyl’s point was that in the context of his \nbook Raum-Zeit-Materie, the kernel-index method of tensor \nanalysis is more appropriate than the methods of the theory of \nalgebraic \n invariants.[85] \n\nWhile this account of events leading up to Weyl’s groundbreaking \npapers on group theory seems reasonable enough, Hawkins (2000) has \nsuggested a fuller account, which brings into focus Weyl’s deep \nphilosophical interest in the mathematical foundations of the theory \nof general relativity by drawing attention to Weyl (1924d) on tensor \nsymmetries, which, according to Hawkins, played an important role in \nredirecting Weyl’s research interests toward pure \n mathematics.[86]\n Weyl (1949b, 400) himself noted that his interest in the \nphilosophical foundations of the general theory of relativity \nmotivated his analysis of the representations and invariants of the \ncontinuous groups: “I can say that the wish to understand what \nreally is the mathematical substance behind the formal apparatus of \nrelativity theory led me to the study of representations and \ninvariants of groups; and my experience in this regard is probably \nnot unique”. Weyl’s paper (Weyl (1924a)), and the first chapter\nWeyl (1925) of his celebrated papers on representation theory, have \nthe same title: “The group theoretic foundation of the tensor \ncalculus”. Hawkins (1998) says, Weyl  \n\nhad obtained through the theory of groups, and in particular through \nthe theory of group representations—as augmented by his own \ncontributions—what he felt was a proper mathematical \nunderstanding of tensors, tensor symmetries, and the reason they \nrepresent the source of all linear quantities that might arise in \nmathematics or physics. Once again, he had come to appreciate the \nimportance of the theory of groups—and now especially the \ntheory of group representation—for gaining insight into \nmathematical questions suggested by relativity theory. Unlike his \nwork on the space problem …Weyl now found himself drawing upon\nfar more than the rudiments of group theory. … And of course \n Cartan[87]\n had showed that the space problem could also be resolved with the aid\nof results about representations. In short, the representation theory\nof groups had proved itself to be a powerful tool for answering the \nsort of mathematical questions that grew out of Weyl’s involvement \nwith relativity theory. \n\nSomewhat later, Weyl (1939) wrote a book, entitled The Classical \nGroups, Their Invariants and Representations, in which \nhe returned to the theory of invariants and representations of the \nsemisimple Lie groups. In this work, he satisfied his ambition \n“to derive the decisive results for the most important of these\ngroups by direct algebraic construction, in particular for the full \ngroup of all non-singular linear transformations and for the \northogonal group”. He intentionally restricted the discussion \nof the general theory and devoted most of the book to the derivation \nof specific results for the general linear, the special linear, the \northogonal and the symplectic groups.  \n\nAs far back as the 1920s, the great French mathematician and geometer\nÉlie Cartan had recognized that the notions\nof parallelism and affine connection admit of an\nimportant generalization in the sense that (1) the spaces for which\nthe notion of infinitesimal parallel transport is defined need not be\nthe tangent spaces that intrinsically arise from the differential\nstructure of a Riemannian manifold \\(M\\) at each of its points;\nrather, the spaces are general spaces that are not intrinsically tied\nto the differential manifold structure of \\(M\\), and (2) relevant\ngroups operate on these general spaces directly and not on the\nmanifold \\(M\\), and therefore groups play a dominant and independent\nrole.  \n\nWeyl (1938a) published a critical review of Cartan’s (1937) book in \nwhich Cartan further developed his notion of moving frames \n(“repères mobiles”) and generalized \nspaces (“espaces généralisés”).\nHowever, Weyl (1988) expressed some of his reservations to Cartan’s \napproach as early as 1925; and four years later Weyl (1929e) \npresented a more detailed critique.  \n\nCartan’s approach to differential geometry is in response to the fact\nthat Euclidean geometry was generalized in two ways resulting in \nessentially two incompatible approaches to \n geometry.[88]\n The first generalization occurred with the discovery of non-Euclidean\ngeometries and with Klein’s (1921) subsequent Erlanger program in \n1872, which provided a coherent group theoretical framework for the \nvarious non-Euclidean geometries. The second generalization of \nEuclidean geometry occurred when Riemann (1854) discovered Riemannian\ngeometry.  \n\nThe two generalizations of Euclidean geometry essentially constitute \nincompatible approaches to applied geometry. In particular, while \nKlein’s Erlanger program provides an appropriate group theoretical \nframework for Einstein’s theory of special relativity, it is \nRiemannian geometry, and not Klein’s group theoretic approach, which \nprovides the appropriate underlying geometric framework for \nEinstein’s theory of general relativity. As Cartan observes:  \n\nGeneral relativity threw into physics and philosophy the antagonism \nthat existed between the two principle directors of geometry, Riemann\nand Klein. The space-times of classical mechanics and of special \nrelativity are of the type of Klein, those of general relativity are \nof the type of \n Riemann.[89] \n\nCartan eliminated the incompatibility between the two approaches by \nsynthesizing Riemannian geometry and Klein’s Erlanger program through\na further generalization of both, resulting in what Cartan called, \ngeneralized spaces (or generalized geometries).  \n\nIn his Erlanger program, Klein provided a unified approach to the \nvarious “global” geometries by showing that each of the \ngeometries is characterized by a particular group of transformations:\nEuclidean geometry is characterized by the group of translations and \nrotations in the plane; the geometry of the sphere \n\\(S^{2}\\) is characterized by the orthogonal group \n\\(O(3)\\); and the geometry of the hyperbolic plane is \ncharacterized by the pseudo-orthogonal group \\(O(1, 2)\\). In \nKlein’s approach each geometry is a (connected) manifold endowed with\na group of automorphisms, that is, a Lie group \\(G\\) of \n“motions” that acts transitively on the \nmanifold, such that two figures are regarded as congruent if and only\nif there exists an element of the appropriate Lie group \\(G\\) that\ntransforms one of the figures into the other. A generalized geometry \nin Klein’s sense shifts the emphasis from the underlying manifold or \nspace to the group. Thus a Klein geometry (space) consists of, (1) a \nsmooth manifold, (2) a Lie group \\(G\\) (the principal group of the\ngeometry), and (3) a transitive action of \\(G\\) on the manifold. \nBesides being “global”, a Klein geometry (space) is \ncompletely homogeneous in the sense that its points cannot be \ndistinguished on the basis of geometric relations because the \ntransitive group action preserves such relations.  \n\nAs Weyl (1949b) describes it, Klein’s approach to the various \n“global” geometries is very suited to Einstein’s theory \nof special relativity:  \n\nAccording to Einstein’s special relativity theory the \nfour-dimensional world of the spacetime points is a Klein space \ncharacterized by a definite group \\(\\Gamma\\); and that group is the \n… group of Euclidean similarities—with one very \nimportant difference however. The orthogonal transformations, i.e., \nthe homogeneous linear transformations which leave  \n\nunchanged have to be replaced by the Lorentz transformations leaving  \n\ninvariant. \n\nHowever, with the advent of Einstein’s general theory of relativity \nthe emphasis shifted from global homogeneous geometric \nstructures to local inhomogeneous structures. Whereas Klein \nspaces are global and fully homogeneous, the Riemannian metric \nstructure underlying Einstein’s general theory is local and \ninhomogeneous. A general Riemannian space admits of no isometry other\nthan the identity.  \n\nReferring to Cartan (1923a), Weyl (1929e) says that Cartan’s \ngeneralization of Klein geometries consists in adapting Klein’s \nErlanger program to infinitesimal geometry by applying Klein’s \nErlanger program to the tangent plane rather than to the manifold \n itself.[90] \n\nCartan developed a general scheme of infinitesimal geometry in which \nKlein’s notions were applied to the tangent plane and not to the \n\\(n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\) itself. Figure 13:\nCartan’s generalization \n\nFigure 13 above, adapted from Sharpe (1997), may help in clarifying \nthe discussion. The generalization of Euclidean geometry to a \nRiemannian space (the left vertical blue arrow) says:  \n\nAnalogously, Cartan’s generalization of a Klein space to a Cartan \nspace (the right vertical blue arrow) says:  Figure 14:\nCartan’s generalized space \n\nCartan’s generalized space \\(\\Sigma\\)(M) is the space of all \n“Tangent Spaces” (i.e., all Klein spaces\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p}))\\) and contains a mixture of \nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous spaces (see figure 14).  \n\nFinally, Cartan’s generalization of Riemannian space (lower \nhorizontal red arrow) (figure 13) turns on the recognition that the \n“Tangent Space” in Cartan’s sense is not\nthe same, or need not be the same, as the ordinary tangent \nspace that arises naturally from the underlying differential\nstructure of a Riemannian manifold. Cartan’s \n“Tangent Space”\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) at \\(p \\in M\\) denotes what is known as\na fiber in modern fiber bundle language, where the manifold\n\\(M\\) is called the base space of the fiber bundle.  \n\nIn Weyl (1929e, 1988) and to a lesser extent in Weyl (1938a), Weyl\nobjected to Cartan’s approach by noting that Cartan’s\n“Tangent Space”, namely the Klein space\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) associated with each point of the manifold \\(M\\),\ndoes not arise intrinsically from the differential structure of the\nmanifold the way the ordinary tangent vector space does. Weyl\ntherefore noted that it is necessary to impose certain non-intrinsic\nembedding conditions on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) that specify how the\n“Tangent Space”\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is associated with each point of the manifold\n\\(M\\). Paraphrasing Weyl, the situation is as follows: We assume that\nwe can associate a copy \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) of a given Klein space with\neach point \\(p\\) of the manifold \\(M\\) and that the displacement of\nthe Klein space \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) at \\(p \\in M\\) to the Klein space\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p'})\\) associated with an infinitely nearby point\n\\(p'\\in M\\), constitutes an isomorphic representation of\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p'})\\) by means of an infinitesimal\naction of the group \\(G\\). In choosing an admissible frame of\nreference \\(f\\) for each Klein space \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\), their points\nare represented by\nnormal coordinates \\(\\xi\\). Any two frames \n\\(f,f'\\) are related by a group \nelement \\(s \\in G\\), and a succession of transformations\n\\(f \\rightarrow f'\\) and \\(f' \\rightarrow f''\\) by \\(s \\in G\\) and \n\\(t \\in G\\) respectively, relates \\(f\\) and \n\\(f''\\) by the group composition \\(t \\circ s \\in G\\).  \n\nNothing so far has been said about how specifically the \n“Tangent Space” \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is connected to the manifold. \nSince \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is supposed to be a \ngeneralization of the ordinary tangent space which arises \nintrinsically from the local differential structure of \\(M\\), Weyl\nsuggests that certain embedding conditions have to be imposed on the \nnormal coordinates \\(\\xi\\) of the Klein space \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\).  \nEmbedding Condition 1: We must first designate\na point as the center of \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) and then require that they\ncoincide or cover the point \\(p \\in M\\). This leads, Weyl says, to a\nrestriction in the choice of a normal coordinate system\n\\(\\xi\\) on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\). And because \\(G\\) acts transitively, a\nnormal coordinate system \\(\\xi\\) on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) can be chosen\nsuch that the normal coordinates \\(\\xi\\) vanish at the center, that\nis, \\(\\xi^{1} = \\xi^{2} = \\cdots = 0\\). The group \\(G\\) is therefore\nrestricted to the subgroup \\(G_{0}\\) of all representations of \\(G\\)\nwhich leave the center invariant.\n \nEmbedding Condition 2: The notion of a tangent\nplane also requires that there is a one-to-one linear mapping between\nthe line elements of \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) starting \nfrom 0, with the line elements of \\(M\\) starting from \\(p\\). \nThis means that the number of dimension of the Klein space \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) has the same number of dimension\nas the manifold \\(M\\). \nEmbedding Condition 3: The infinitesimal \ndisplacement \\(\\Sigma(M_{p}) \\rightarrow \\Sigma(M_{p'})\\) will carry an \ninfinitesimal vector at the center of \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\), which is in one-to-one \ncorrespondence with a vector at \\(p \\in M\\), to the \ncenter of \\(\\Sigma(M_{p'})\\).  \n\nNo further conditions need be imposed according to Weyl. If we\ndisplace \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) by successive steps around a curve\n\\(\\gamma\\) back to the point \\(p \\in M\\) then the final position of\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is obtained from its original poition or orientation\nby a certain automorphism \\(\\Sigma(M_{p}) \\rightarrow\n\\Sigma(M_{p})\\). This automorphism is Cartan’s generalization of\nRiemann’s concept of curvature along the curve \\(\\gamma\\) on\n\\(M\\).  \n\nAccording to Weyl, the “Tangent Space”\n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is not uniquely determined by the differential\nstructure of \\(M\\). If \\(G\\) were the affine group, Weyl says, then\nthe conditions above would fully specify the normal\ncoordinate system \\(\\xi^{\\alpha}\\) on \\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) as a function\nof the chosen local coordinates \\(x^{i}\\) on \\(M\\). Since this is not\nthe case if \\(G\\) is a more extensive group than the affine group,\nWeyl concludes that the\n“Tangent Space” \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) “is not as yet uniquely \ndetermined by the nature of \\(M\\), and so long as this is not \naccomplished we can not say that Cartan’s theory deals only with the \nmanifold \\(M\\).” Weyl adds:  \n\nConversely, the tangent plane in \\(p\\) in the ordinary sense, that\nis, the linear manifold of line elements in \\(p\\), is a centered \naffine space; its group \\(G\\) is not a matter of convention. This \nhas always appeared to me to be a deficiency of the theory …. \n\nThe reader may wish to consult Ryckman (2005, 171–173), who \nargues “that a philosophical contention, indeed, \nphenomenological one, underlies the stated mathematical reasons that \nkept him [Weyl] for a number of years from concurring with Cartan’s \n”moving frame“ approach to differential geometry”.  \n\nIn 1949 Weyl explicitly acknowledged and praised Cartan’s approach. \nUnlike his earlier critical remarks, he now considered it to be a \nvirtue that the frame of reference in \n\\(\\Sigma(M_{p})\\) is independent of the choice of \ncoordinates on \\(M\\). Weyl (1949b) says of the traditional \napproach and Cartan’s new approach to geometry:  \n\nHence we have here before us the natural general basis on which that \nnotion rests. The infinitesimal trend in geometry initiated by Gauss’\ntheory of curved surfaces now merges with that other line of thought \nthat culminated in Klein’s Erlanger program.  \n\nIt is not advisable to bind the frame of reference in \\(\\Sigma_{p}\\)\nto the coordinates \\(x^{i}\\) covering the neighborhood of \\(p\\) in\n\\(M\\). In this respect the old treatment of affinely connected\nmanifolds is misleading. … [I]n the modern development of\ninfinitesimal geometry in the large, where it combines with topology\nand the associated Klein spaces appear under the name of fibres, it\nhas been found best to keep the répères, the\nframes of the fibre spaces, independent of the coordinates of the\nunderlying manifold. \n\nMoreover, in 1949, Weyl also emphasizes that it is necessary to \nemploy Cartan’s method if one wishes to fit Dirac’s theory of the \nelectron into general relativity. Weyl (1949b) says:  \n\nWhen one tries to fit Dirac’s theory of the electron into general \nrelativity, it becomes imperative to adopt the Cartan method. For \nDirac’s four \\(\\psi\\)-components are relative to a Cartesian (or rather \na Lorentz) frame. One knows how they transform under transition from \none Lorentz frame to another (spin representation of the Lorentz \ngroup); but this law of transformation is of such a nature that it \ncannot be extended to arbitrary linear transformations mediating \nbetween affine frames. \n\nWeyl is here referring to his three important papers, which appeared \nin 1929—the same year in which he had published his detailed \ncritique of Cartan’s method—in which he investigates the \nadaptation of Dirac’s theory of the special relativistic electron to \nthe theory of general relativity, and where he develops the \ntetrad or Vierbein formalism for the representation\nof local two-component spinor structures on Lorentz \nmanifolds.  \n\nOnly a year after Pauli’s review article in 1921, in which Pauli had \nargued that Weyl’s defence of his unified field theory deprives it of\nits inherent convincing power from a physical point of view, \nSchrödinger (1922) suggested the possibility that Weyl’s 1918 \ngauge theory could suitably be employed in the quantum mechanical \ndescription of the \n electron.[91]\n Similar proposals were subsequently made by Fock (1926) and London \n(1927).  \n\nWith the advent of the quantum theory of the electron around 1927/28 \nWeyl abandoned his gauge theory of 1918. He did so because in the new\nquantum theory a different kind of gauge invariance associated with \nDirac’s theory of the electron was discovered which, as had been \nsuggested by Fock (1926) and London (1927), more adequately accounted\nfor the conservation of electric \n charge.[92]\n Why did Weyl hold on to his gauge theory for almost a decade despite \na preponderance of compelling empirical arguments that were mounted \nagainst it by Einstein, Pauli and \n others?[93]\n In one of Weyl’s (1918/1998) last letters to Einstein concerning his \nunified field theory, Weyl made it clear that it was mathematics \nand not physics that was the driving force behind his unified \nfield \n theory.[94] \n\nIncidentally, you must not believe that it was because of physics \nthat I introduced the linear differential form d\\(\\varphi\\) in addition \nto the quadratic form. I wanted rather to eliminate this \n“inconsistency” which always has been a bone of \ncontention to \n me.[95]\n And then, to my surprise, I realized that it looked as if it might \nexplain electricity. You clap your hands above your head and shout: \nBut physics is not made this way! \n\nAs London (1927, 376–377) remarks, one must admire Weyl’s \nimmense courage in developing his gauge invariant interpretation of \nelectromagnetism and holding on to it on the mere basis of purely \nformal considerations. London observes that the principle of \nequivalence of inertial and gravitational mass, which prompted \nEinstein to provide a geometrical interpretation of gravity, was at \nleast a physical fact underlying gravitational theory. In contrast, \nan analogous fact was not known in the theory of electricity; \nconsequently, it would seem that there was no compelling physical \nreason to think that rigid rods and ideal clocks would be under the \nuniversal influence of the electromagnetic field. To the contrary, \nLondon says, experience strongly suggests that atomic clocks exhibit \nsharp spectral lines that are unaffected by their history in the \npresence of a magnetic field, contrary to Weyl’s non-integrability \nassumption. London concludes, that in the face of such elementary \nempirical facts it must have been an unusually clear metaphysical \nconviction which prevented Weyl from abandoning his idea that nature \nought to make use of the beautiful geometrical possibilities that a \npure infinitesimal geometry offers.  \n\nIn 1955, shortly before his death, Weyl wrote an \n addendum[96]\n to his 1918 paper Gravitation und \nElektrizität, in which he looks back at \nhis early attempt to find a unified field theory and explains why he \nreinterpreted his gauge theory of 1918, a decade later.  \n\nThis work stands at the beginning of attempts to construct a \n“unified field theory” which subsequently were continued \nby many, it seems to me, without decisive results. As is known, the \nproblem relentlessly occupied Einstein in particular, until his end. \n… The strongest argument for my theory appeared to be that \ngauge invariance corresponds to the principle of the conservation of \nelectric charge just as coordinate invariance corresponds to the \nconservation theorem of energy-impulse. Later, quantum theory \nintroduced the Schrödinger-Dirac potential \\(\\psi\\) of the \nelectron-positron field; the latter revealed an experimentally based \nprinciple of gauge invariance which guaranteed the conservation of \ncharge and which connected the \\(\\psi\\) with the electromagnetic \npotentials \\(\\varphi_{i}\\) in the same way that my \nspeculative theory had connected the gravitational potentials \n\\(g_{ik}\\) with \\(\\varphi_{i}\\), where,\nin addition, the \\(\\varphi_{i}\\) are measured in known \natomic rather than unknown cosmological units. I have no doubts that \nthe principle of gauge invariance finds its correct place here and \nnot, as I believed in 1918, in the interaction of electromagnetism \nand gravity. \n\nBy the late 1920s Weyl’s methodological approach to gauge theory \nunderwent an “empirical turn”. In contrast to \\(a\\) \npriori geometrical reasoning, which guided his early \nunification attempts—Weyl calls it a “speculative \ntheory” in the above citation—by 1928/1929 Weyl \nemphasized experimentally-based principles which underlie \ngauge \n invariance.[97] \n\nIn early 1928 P. A. M. Dirac provided the first physically compelling\ntheoretical account of the dynamics of an electron in the presence of\nan electric field. The components \\(\\psi^{i} (x)\\)\nof Dirac’s four-component wave function or spinor field in \nMinkowski space, \\(\\psi(x) = (\\psi^{1}(x), \\psi^{2}(x), \\psi^{3}(x), \n\\psi^{4}(x))\\), are complex-valued functions that \nsatisfy Dirac’s first-order partial differential equation and provide\nprobabilistic information about the electron’s dynamical behaviour, \nsuch as angular momentum and location. Prior to the appearance of \nspinor fields \\(\\psi\\) in Dirac’s equation, it was generally \nthought that scalars, vectors and tensors provided an adequate system\nof mathematical objects that would allow one to provide a \nmathematical description of reality independently of the choice of \ncoordinates or reference \n frames.[98]\n For example, spin zero particles \\((\\pi\\) mesons, \\(\\alpha\\) particles) \ncould be described by means of scalars; spin 1 particles (deuterons) \nby vectors, and spin 2 particles (hypothetical gravitons) by tensors.\nHowever, the most frequently occurring particles in Nature are \nelectrons, protons, and neutrons. They are spin \n\\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\) particles, called fermions that \nare properly described by mathematical objects called \nspinors, which are neither scalars, vectors or \n tensors.[99]\n Weyl referred to the \\(\\psi(x)\\) in Dirac’s equation as the \n“Dirac quantity” and von Neumann called it the \n“\\(\\psi(x)\\)-vector”. Both von Neumann and Weyl, and \nothers, immediately recognized that Dirac had introduced something \nthat was new in theoretical physics. v. Neumann (1928, 876) remarks:  \n\n… \\(\\psi\\) does by no means have the relativistic transformation \nproperties of a common four-vector. … The case of a quantity \nwith four components that is not a four-vector is a case which has \nnever occurred in relativity theory; the Dirac \\(\\psi\\)-vector is the \nfirst example of this type. \n\n(Weyl (1929c)) notes that the spinor representation of the orthogonal\ngroup \\(O(1, 3)\\) cannot be extended to a representation of the \ngeneral linear group \\(GL(n)\\), \\(n = 4\\), with the \nconsequence that it is necessary to employ the Vierbein, \ntetrad or Lorentz-structure formulation of the theory of \ngeneral relativity in order to incorporate Dirac’s spinor fields \n\\(\\psi(x)\\):  \n\nThe tensor calculus is not the proper mathematical instrument to use \nin translating the quantum-theoretic equations of the electron over \ninto the general theory of relativity. Vectors and terms \n[tensors] are so constituted that the law which defines the \ntransformation of their components from one Cartesian set of axes to \nanother can be extended to the most general linear transformation, to\nan affine set of axes. That is not the case for quantity \\(\\psi\\), \nhowever; this kind of quantity belongs to a representation of the \nrotation group which cannot be extended to the affine group. \nConsequently we cannot introduce components of \\(\\psi\\) relative to an \narbitrary coordinate system in general relativity as we can for the \nelectromagnetic potential and field strengths. We must rather \ndescribe the metric at a point \\(p\\) by local Cartesian axes \n\\(e(a)\\) instead of by the \\(g_{pq}\\). \nThe wave field has definite components \n\\(\\psi^{+}_{1}, \\psi^{+}_{2}, \\psi^{-}_{1}, \\psi^{-}_{2}\\) \nrelative to such axes, and we know how they transform on transition to\nany other Cartesian axes in \\(p\\). \n\nImpressed by the initial success of Dirac’s equation of the spinning \nelectron within the special relativistic context, Weyl adapted \nDirac’s special relativistic theory of the electron to the general \ntheory of relativity in three groundbreaking papers (Weyl \n(1929b,c,d)). A complete exposition of this formalism is presented in\n(Weyl (1929b)). O’Raifeartaigh (1997) says of this paper:  \n\nAlthough not fully appreciated at the time, Weyl’s 1929 paper has \nturned out to be one of the seminal papers of the century, both from \nthe philosophical and from the technical point of view. \n\nIn this ground braking paper, as well as in (Weyl (1929c,d)), Weyl \nexplicitly abandons his earlier attempt to unify electromagnetism \nwith the theory of general relativity. In his early attempt he \nassociated the electromagnetic vector potential \n\\(A_{j}(x)\\) with the additional connection \ncoefficients that arise when a conformal structure is reduced to a \nWeyl structure (see §4.1). The important concept of gauge \ninvariance, however, is preserved in his 1929 paper. Rather than \nassociating gauge transformations with the scale or gauge of the \nspacetime metric tensor, Weyl now associates gauge transformations \nwith the phase of the Dirac spinor field \\(\\psi\\) that represents \nmatter. In the introduction of (Weyl (1929b)), which presents in \ndetail the new formalism, Weyl describes his reinterpretation of the \ngauge principle as follows:  \n\nThe Dirac field-equations for \\(\\psi\\) together with the Maxwell \nequations for the four potentials \\(f_{p}\\) of the \nelectromagnetic field have an invariance property which, from a \nformal point of view, is similar to the one that I called gauge \ninvariance in my theory of gravitation and electromagnetism of 1918; \nthe equations remain invariant when one makes the simultaneous \nreplacements  \n\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) is understood to be an arbitrary function of\nposition in the four-dimensional world. Here the factor\n\\(\\bfrac{e}{ch}\\), where \\(- e\\) is the charge of the electron, \\(c\\)\nis the speed of light, and \\(\\bfrac{h}{\\pi}\\) is the quantum of\naction, has been absorbed in \\(f_{p}\\). The connection of this\n“gauge invariance” to the conservation of electric charge\nremains untouched. But an essential difference, which is significant\nfor the correspondence to experience, is that the exponent of the\nfactor multiplying \\(\\psi\\) is not real but purely imaginary. \\(\\psi\\)\nnow assumes the role that \\(ds\\) played in Einstein’s old\ntheory. It seems to me that this new principle of gauge invariance,\nwhich follows not from speculation but from experiment, compellingly\nindicates that the electromagnetic field is a necessary\naccompanying phenomenon, not of gravitation, but of the material wave\nfield represented by \\(\\psi\\). Since gauge invariance includes an\narbitrary function \\(\\lambda\\) it has the character of\n“general” relativity and can naturally only be understood\nin that context. \n\nWeyl then introduces his two-component spinor theory in Minkowski\nspace. Since one of his aims is to adapt Dirac’s theory to the\ncurved spacetime of general relativity, Weyl develops a theory\nof local spinor structures for curved\n spacetime.[100]\n He achieves this by providing a systematic formulation of \nlocal tetrads or Vierbeins (orthonormal basis\nvectors). Orthonormal frames had already been introduced as early as\n1900 by Levi-Civita and Ricci. Somewhat later, Cartan had shown the\nusefulness of employing local orthonormal-basis vector fields, the\nso-called “moving frames” in his investigation of\nRiemannian geometry in the 1920s. In addition, Einstein (1928) had\nused tetrads or Vierbeins in his attempt to unify gravitation and\nelectricity by resorting to distant parallelism\nwith torsion. In Einstein’s theory, the effects of\ngravity and electromagnetism are associated with a specialized torsion\nof spacetime rather than with the curvature of spacetime. Since the\ncurvature vanishes everywhere, distant parallelism is a feature of\nEinstein’s theory. However, distant parallelism appeared to Weyl\nto be quite unnatural from the viewpoint of Riemannian geometry. Weyl\nexpressed his criticism in all three papers (Weyl (1929b,c,d)) and he\ncontrasted the way in which Vierbeins are employed in his own work\nwith the way they were used by Einstein. In the introduction Weyl\n(1929b) says:  \n\nI prefer not to believe in distant parallelism for a number of \nreasons. First, my mathematical attitude resists accepting such an \nartificial geometry; it is difficult for me to understand the force \nthat would keep the local tetrads at different points and in rotated \npositions in a rigid relationship. There are, I believe, two \nimportant physical reasons as well. In particular, by loosening the \nrigid relationship between the tetrads at different points, the gauge\nfactor \\(e^{i\\lambda}\\), which remains arbitrary \nwith respect to the quantity \\(\\psi\\), changes from a constant to an \narbitrary function of spacetime location; that is, only through the \nloosening of the rigidity does the actual gauge invariance become \nunderstandable. Secondly, the possibility to rotate the tetrads at \ndifferent points independently from each other, is as we shall see, \nequivalent to the symmetry of the energy-momentum tensor or with the \nvalidity of its conservation law. \n\nEvery tetrad uniquely determines the pseudo-Riemannian spacetime\nmetric \\(g_{ij}\\). However, the converse does not hold since the\ntetrad has 16 independent components whereas the spacetime metric,\n\\(g_{ij} = g_{ji}\\), has only 10 independent components. The extra 6\ndegrees of freedom of the tetrads that are not determined by the\nmetric may be represented by the elements of a 6-parameter internal\nLorentz group. That is, the local tetrads are determined by the\nspacetime metric up to local Lorentz transformations. The tetrad\nformalism made it possible, therefore, for Weyl to derive, as a\nspecial case of Noether’s second\n theorem[101],\n the energy-momentum conservation laws for general coordinate\ntransformations and the internal Lorentz transformations of the\ntetrads. Moreover, Weyl had always emphasized the strong analogy\nbetween gravitation and electricity. The tetrad formalism and the\nconservation laws both made explicit and supported this analogy.  \n\nWeyl introduced the final section of his seminal 1929 paper saying \n“We now come to the critical part of the theory”, and \npresented a derivation of electromagnetism from the new gauge \nprinciple. The initial step in Weyl’s derivation exploits the \nintrinsic gauge freedom of his two-component theory of spinors for \nMinkowski space, namely  \n\nwhere the gauge factor is a constant. Since Weyl wished to adapt his \ntheory to the curved spacetime of general relativity, the above phase\ntransformation must be generalized to accommodate local \ntetrads. That is, each spacetime point has its own tetrad and \ntherefore its own point-dependent gauge factor. The phase \ntransformation is thus given by  \n\nwhere the \\(\\lambda(x)\\) is a function of spacetime. Weyl says:  \n\nWe come now to the critical part of the theory. In my view the origin\nand the necessity for the electromagnetic field lie in the following \njustification. The components \\(\\psi_{1},\\psi_{2}\\) \nare, in fact, not uniquely determined by the tetrad but only to the \nextent that they can still be multiplied by an arbitrary \n“gauge-factor” \\(e^{i\\lambda}\\) of \nabsolute value 1. The transformation of the \\(\\psi\\) induced by a \nrotation of the tetrad is determined only up to such a factor. In the\nspecial theory of relativity one must regard this gauge factor as a \nconstant, since we have here only a single point-independent tetrad. \nThis is different in the general theory of relativity. Every point \nhas its own tetrad, and hence its own arbitrary gauge factor, because\nthe gauge factor necessarily becomes an arbitrary function of \nposition through the removal of the rigid connection between tetrads \nat different points. \n\nToday, the concept of gauge invariance plays a central role in \ntheoretical physics. Not until 1954 did Yang and Mills (1954) \ngeneralize Weyl’s electromagnetic gauge concept to the case of the \nnon-Abelian group \n \\(O(3)\\).[102]\n Although Weyl’s reinterpretation of gauge invariance had been \npreceded by suggestions from London and Fock, it was Weyl, according \nto O’Raifeartaigh and Straumann (2000),  \n\nwho emphasized the role of gauge invariance as a symmetry \nprinciple from which electromagnetism can be derived. It took \nseveral decades until the importance of this symmetry \nprinciple—in its generalized form to non-Abelian gauge groups \ndeveloped by Yang, Mills, and others—also became fruitful for a\ndescription of the weak and strong interactions. The mathematics of \nthe non-Abelian generalization of Weyl’s 1929 paper would have been \nan easy task for a mathematician of his rank, but at the time there \nwas no motivation for this from the physics side. \n\nIt is interesting in this context to consider the following remarks \nby Yang. Referring to Einstein’s objection to Weyl’s 1918 gauge \ntheory, Yang (1986, 18) asked, “what has happened to Einstein’s\noriginal objection after quantum mechanics inserted an \\(-i\\) into\nthe scale factor and made it into a phase factor?” Yang \ncontinuous:  \n\nApparently no one had, after 1929, relooked at Einstein’s objection \nuntil I did in 1983. The result is interesting and deserves perhaps \nto be a footnote in the history of science: Let us take Einstein’s \nGedankenexperiment …. When the two clocks come back, because \nof the insertion of the factor \\(-i\\), they would not have \ndifferent scales but different phases. That would not influence their\nrates of time-keeping. Therefore, Einstein’s original objection \ndisappears. But you can ask a further question: Can one measure their\nphase difference? Well, to measure a phase difference one must do an \ninterference experiment. Nobody knows how to do an interference \nexperiment with big objects like clocks. However, one can do \ninterference experiments with electrons. So let us change Einstein’s \nGedankenexperiment to one of bringing electrons back along two \ndifferent paths and ask: Can one measure the phase difference? The \nanswer is yes. That was in fact a most important development in 1959 \nand 1960 when Aharonov and Bohm realized—completely \nindependently of Weyl—that electromagnetism has some meaning \nwhich was not understood \n before.[103] \n\nWe end the discussion on Weyl’s gauge theory by quoting the following\nremarks by Dyson (1983).  \n\nA more recent example of a great discovery in mathematical physics \nwas the idea of a gauge field, invented by Hermann Weyl in 1918. This\nidea has taken only 50 years to find its place as one of the basic \nconcepts of modern particle physics. Quantum chromodynamics, the most\nfashionable theory of the particle physicists in 1981, is \nconceptually little more than a synthesis of Lie’s group-algebras \nwith Weyl’s gauge fields.  \n\nThe history of Weyl’s discovery is quite unlike the history of Lie \ngroups and Grassmann algebras. Weyl was neither obscure nor \nunrecognized, and he was working in 1918 in the most fashionable area\nof physics, the newborn theory of general relativity. He invented \ngauge fields as a solution of the fashionable problem of unifying \ngravitation with electromagnetism. For a few months gauge fields were\nat the height of fashion. Then it was discovered by Weyl and others \nthat they did not do what was expected of them. Gauge fields were in \nfact no good for the purpose for which Weyl invented them. They \nquickly became unfashionable and were almost forgotten. But then, \nvery gradually over the next fifty years, it became clear that gauge \nfields were important in a quite different context, in the theory of \nquantum electrodynamics and its extensions leading up to the recent \ndevelopment of quantum chromodynamics. The decisive step in the \nrehabilitation of gauge fields was taken by our Princeton colleague \nFrank Yang and his student Bob Mills in 1954, one year before Hermann\nWeyl’s death [Yang and Mills, 1954]. There is no evidence that Weyl \never knew or cared what Yang and Mills had done with his brain-child.\n \n\nSo the story of gauge fields is full of ironies. A fashionable idea, \ninvented for a purpose which turns out to be ephemeral, survives a \nlong period of obscurity and emerges finally as a corner-stone of \nphysics. \n\nIt is remarkable that Weyl’s (1929b) two-component spinor formalism \nled him to anticipate the existence of particles that violate \nconservation of parity, that is, left-right symmetry. In 1929 \nleft-right symmetry was taken for granted and considered a basic fact\nof all the laws of Nature. Weyl formulated the four-component Dirac \nspinor \\(\\psi\\) in terms of a two-component left-handed Weyl spinor \n\\(\\psi_{L}\\) and a two-component right-handed Weyl spinor\n\\(\\psi_{R}\\):  \n\nThe four-component Dirac spinor, formulated in terms of the two Weyl \nspinors  \n\npreserves parity; it applies to all massive spin \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\)\nparticles (fermions) and all massive fermions are known to obey parity\nconservation. However, a single Weyl spinor, either \\(\\psi_{L}\\) or\n\\(\\psi_{R}\\), does not preserve parity. Weyl noted that instead of the\nfour-component Dirac spinor “two components suffice if the\nrequirement of left-right symmetry (parity) is dropped”. A\nlittle later he added, “the restriction 2 removes the\nequivalence of left and right.  It is only the fact that left-right\nsymmetry actually appears in Nature that forces us to introduce a\nsecond pair of \\(\\psi\\)-components”. Weyl’s two-spinor\nversion of the Dirac equation is a coupled system of\nequations requiring both Weyl spinors \\(\\psi_{L}\\) and \\(\\psi_{R}\\) in\norder to preserve parity. Weyl considerd massless particles in his\ntwo-spinor version of the Dirac equation.  In this case, the equations\nof the two-spinor version of Dirac’s equation decouple,\nyielding an equation for \\(\\psi_{L}\\) and for \\(\\psi_{R}\\). These\nequations are independent of each other, and the equation for the\n2-component left-handed Weyl spinor \\(\\psi_{L}\\) is\ncalled Weyl’s equation; it is applicable to the\nmassless particle called the\n neutrino[104],\na spin \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\) particle, that was discovered in 1956. Yang\n(1986, 12) remarks  \n\nNow I come to another piece of work of Weyl’s which dates back to \n1929, and is called Weyl’s two-component neutrino theory. He invented\nthis theory in 1929 in one of his very important articles … as\na mathematical possibility satisfying most of the requirements of \nphysics. But it was rejected by him and by subsequent physicists \nbecause it did not satisfy left-right symmetry. With the realisation \nthat left-right symmetry was not exactly right in 1957 it became \nclear that this theory of Weyl’s should immediately be re-looked at. \nSo it was and later it was verified theoretically and experimentally \nthat this theory gave, in fact, the correct description of the \nneutrino. \n\nDuring the interval from 1924–26, in which Weyl was intensely \noccupied with the pure mathematics of Lie groups, the essentials of \nthe formal apparatus of the new revolutionary theory of quantum \nmechanics had been completed by Heisenberg, Schrödinger and \nothers. As if to make up for lost time, Weyl immediately returned \nfrom pure mathematics to theoretical physics, and applied his new \ngroup theoretical results to quantum mechanics. As Yang (1986, 9, 10)\ndescribes it,  \n\nIn the midst of Weyl’s profound research on Lie groups there\noccurred a great revolution in physics, namely the development of\nquantum mechanics. We shall perhaps never know Weyl’s initial\nreaction to this development, but he soon got into the act and studied\nthe mathematical structure of the new mechanics. There resulted a\npaper of 1927 and later a book, this book together with Wigner’s\narticles and Gruppen Theorie und Ihre Anwendung auf die Quanten\nMechanik der Atome were instrumental in introducing group theory\ninto the very language of quantum mechanics. \n\nMehra and Rechenberg (2000, 482) note in this context: \n“Actually, we have mentioned in previous volumes Weyl’s early \nreactions to both matrix mechanics (in 1925) and wave mechanics (in \nearly 1926), and they were very enthusiastic. Therefore, we have to \nassume quite firmly that it was only his deep involvement with the \nlast stages of his work on the theory of semisimple continuous groups\nthat prevented Weyl ‘to get in the act’ \nimmediately.”  \n\nWeyl was particularly well positioned to handle some of the \nmathematical and foundational problems of the new theory of quantum \nmechanics. Almost every aspect of his mathematical expertise, in \nparticular, his recent work on group theory and his very early work \non the theory of singular differential-integral equations \n(1908–1911), provided him with the precise tools for solving \nmany of the concrete problems posed by the new theory: the theory of \nHilbert space, singular differential equations, eigenfunction \nexpansions, the symmetric group, and unitary representations of Lie \ngroups.  \n\nWeyl’s (1927) paper, referred to by Yang above, is entitled \nQuantenmechanik und Gruppentheorie (Quantum Mechanics \nand Group Theory). In it, Weyl provides an analysis of the \nfoundations of quantum mechanics and he emphasizes the fundamental \nrole Lie groups play in that \n theory.[105]\n Weyl begins the paper by raising two questions: (1) how do I arrive \nat the self-adjoint operators, which represent a given quantity of a \nphysical system whose constitution is known, and (2), what is the \nphysical interpretation of these operators and which physical \nconsequences can be derived from them? Weyl suggests that while the \nsecond question has been answered by von Neumann, the first question \nhas not yet received a satisfactory answer, and Weyl proposes to \nprovide one with the help of group theory.  \n\nIn a way, Weyl’s 1927 paper was programmatic in character; nearly all\nthe topics of that paper were taken up again a year later in his \nfamous book (Weyl (1928)) entitled Gruppentheorie und \nQuantenmechanik (The Theory of Groups and Quantum \nMechanics). The book emerged from the lecture notes taken by a \nstudent named F. Bohnenblust of Weyl’s lectures given in Zürich \nduring the winter semester 1927–28. A revised edition of that \nbook appeared in 1931. In the preface to the first edition Weyl says:\n \n\nAnother time I venture on stage with a book that belongs only half to\nmy professional field of mathematics, the other half to physics. The \nexternal reason is not very different from that which led some time \nago to the origin of the book Raum Zeit Materie. In the \nwinter term 1927/28 Zürich was suddenly deprived of all \ntheoretical physics by the simultaneous departures of Debye and \nSchrödinger. I tried to fill the gap by changing an already \nannounced lecture course on group theory into one on group theory and\nquantum mechanics. \n … \nSince I have for some years been deeply occupied with the theory of\nthe representation of continuous groups, it appeared to me at this\npoint to be a fitting and useful project, to provide an organically\ncoherent account of the knowledge in this field won by mathematicians,\non such a scale and in such a form, that is suitable for the\nrequirements of quantum physics. \n\nWeyl’s book is one of the first textbooks on the new theory of \nquantum mechanics. As Weyl indicates in the preface it was necessary \nfor him to include a short account of the foundation of quantum \ntheory in order to be able to show how the theory of groups finds its\napplication in that theory. If the book fulfils its purpose, Weyl \nsuggests, then the reader should be able to learn from it the \nessentials of both the theory of groups and quantum theory. Weyl’s \naim was to explain the mathematics to the physicists and the physics \nto the mathematicians. However, as Yang (1986, 10) points out, \nreferring to Weyl’s book:  \n\nWeyl was a mathematician and a philosopher. He liked to deal with \nconcepts and the connection between them. His book was very famous, \nand was recognized as profound. Almost every theoretical physicist \nborn before 1935 has a copy of it on his bookshelves. But very few \nread it: Most are not accustomed to Weyl’s concentration on the \nstructural aspects of physics and feel uncomfortable with his \nemphasis on concepts. The book was just too abstract for most \nphysicists. \n\nWeyl’s book (Weyl (1931b, 2 edn)) is remarkably complete for such an \nearly work and covers many topics. Chapters I and III are mainly \nconcerned with preliminary mathematical concepts. The first chapter \nprovides an account of the theory of finite dimensional Hilbert \nspaces and the third chapter is an exposition of the unitary \nrepresentation theory of finite groups and compact Lie groups. \nChapter II is entitled Quantum Theory; it is the earliest \nsystematic and comprehensive account of the new quantum theory. \nChapter IV, entitled Application of the Theory of Groups\nto Quantum Mechanics, is divided into four parts. In part A, \nentitled The Rotation Group, Weyl provides a systematic \nexplanatory account of the theory of atomic spectra in terms of the \nunitary representation theory of the rotation group, followed by a \ndiscussion of the selection and intensity rules. Part B is entitled \nThe Lorentz Group. After discussing the spin of the electron\nand its role in accounting for the anomalous Zeeman effect, Weyl \npresents Dirac’s theory of the relativistic quantum mechanics of the \nelectron and develops in detail the theory of an electron in a \nspherically symmetric field, including an analysis of the fine \nstructure of the spectrum. In part C, entitled The Permutation \nGroup, Weyl applies the Pauli exclusion principle to explicate \nthe periodic table of the elements. Next, Weyl develops the second \nquantization of the Maxwell and Dirac fields required for the \nanalysis of many body relativistic systems. Weyl noted in the preface\nto the second edition that his treatment is in accordance with the \nrecent work of Heisenberg and Pauli. It is now customary to include \nsuch a topic under the heading of relativistic quantum field theory. \nThe final part of Chapter IV, part D, is entitled Quantum \nKinematics; it provides an exposition of part II of Weyl’s \n(1927) paper, mentioned earlier. Chapter V, entitled The \nSymmetric Permutation Group and the Algebra of Symmetric \nTransformations, is for the most part pure mathematics. It is \nwidely regraded to be the most difficult part of the Weyl’s book.  \n\nOverall, Weyl’s treatment is quite modern except for the confusion \nregarding the positive electron (anti-electron) that at that time was\nidentified with the proton rather than with the positron, which was \ndiscovered a few years later. Weyl was quite concerned about the \nidentification of the proton with the positive electron because his \nanalysis of the discrete symmetries \\(\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{P}, \\mathbf{T}\\) and \n\\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\) led him to conclude that the mass of the positive electron\nshould equal the mass of the \n electron.[106] \n\nWeyl (1931b, 2 edn) analyzed Dirac’s relativistic theory of the \nelectron (Dirac (1928a,b)). Although this theory correctly accounted \nfor the spin of the electron, there was however a problem because in \naddition to the positive-energy levels, Dirac’s theory predicted the \nexistence of an equal number of negative-energy levels. Dirac (1930) \nreinterpreted the theory by assuming that all of the negative-energy \nlevels were normally occupied. The Pauli Exclusion Principle, which \nasserts that it is impossible for two electrons to occupy the same \nquantum state, would prevent an electron with positive energy from \nfalling into a negative- energy state. Dirac’s theory also predicted \nthat one of the negative-energy electrons could be raised to a state \nof positive energy, thereby creating a ‘hole’ or \nunoccupied negative-energy state. Such a hole would behave like a \nparticle with a positive energy and a positive charge, that is, like \na positive electron.  \n\nBecause the only fundamental particles that were known to exist at \nthat time were the electron and the proton, one was justifiably \nreluctant to postulate the existence of new particles that had not \nyet been observed experimentally; consequently, it was suggested that\nthe positive electron should be identified with the proton. However, \nWeyl was quite concerned about the identification of the proton with \nthe anti-electron. In the preface to the second German edition of his\nbook Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik, Weyl (1928, 2 edn, \n1931, VII) wrote  \n\nThe problem of the proton and the electron is discussed in connection\nwith the symmetry properties of the quantum laws with respect to the \ninterchange of right and left, past and future, and positive and \nnegative electricity. At present no acceptable solution is in sight; \nI fear, that in the context of this problem, the clouds are rolling \ntogether to form a new, serious crisis in quantum physics. \n\nWeyl had good reasons for his concern. He analyzed the invariance of \nthe Maxwell-Dirac equations under the discrete symmetries that \ncorrespond to the transformations now called \\(\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{P}, \n\\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\) both for the case of relativistic quantum \nmechanics and for the case of relativistic quantum field theory, and \nconcluded in both cases that the mass of the anti-electron should be \nthe same as the mass of the electron. That the mass of the proton was\nso different from the mass of the electron, therefore, appeared to \nWeyl to constitute a new serious crisis in physics.  \n\nIn a lecture presented at the Centenary for Hermann Weyl held at the \nETH in Zürich, Yang (1986, 10) says of the above quote from \nWeyl’s preface to the second edition of Gruppentheorie und \nQuantenmechanik:  \n\nThis was a most remarkable passage in retrospect. The symmetry that \nhe mentioned here, of physical laws with respect to the interchange \nof right and left, had been introduced by Weyl and Wigner \nindependently into quantum physics. It was called parity \nconservation, denoted by the symbol \\(P\\). The symmetry between \nthe past and future was something that was not well understood in \n1930. It was understood later by Wigner, was called time reversal \ninvariance, and was denoted by the symbol \\(T\\). The symmetry with\nrespect to positive and negative electricity was later called charge \nconjugation invariance \\(C\\). It is a symmetry of physical laws \nwhen you change positive and negative signs of electricity. Nobody, \nto my knowledge, absolutely nobody in the year 1930, was in any way \nsuspecting that these symmetries were related in any manner. I will \ncome back to this matter later. What had prompted Weyl in 1930 to \nwrite the above passage is a great mystery to me. \n\nIt would seem that Yang’s comment is misleading since it\nsuggests that Weyl did not have a good reason for his remark. In fact,\nhowever, Weyl’s statement was firmly based on a detailed\nanalysis of the discrete symmetries \\(\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{P},\n\\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\).  Coleman and Korté (2001)\nhave shown in detail that Weyl’s treatment of these symmetries\nis the same as that used today except for the fact that the\nsymmetry \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) is treated by Weyl as linear and unitary,\nrather than as antilinear and antiunitary. Weyl had presented in 1931\na complete analysis, in the context of the quantized Maxwell-Dirac\nfield equations, of the discrete symmetries that are now called\n\\(\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{P}, \\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\). His\ntransformations \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) are the same as\nthose used today. His transformations \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\) are also very close to those used today except that\nWeyl’s transformations were linear and unitary rather than\nantilinear and antiunitary.  Moreover, Weyl drew two very\nimportant conclusions from his analysis of these discrete\nsymmetries. First, Weyl announced that the important question of the\narrow of time had been solved because the field equations were not\ninvariant under his time-reversal transformation\n\\(\\mathbf{T}\\). Second, Weyl pointed out that the invariance of the\nfield equations under his charge-conjugation transformation\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) implied that the mass of the\n‘anti-electron’ is necessarily the same as that of the\nelectron; moreover, Weyl’s result is the primary reason that\nDirac (1931, 61) abandoned the assignment of the proton to the role of\nthe anti-electron. Many years later Dirac (1977, 145) recalled:  \n\nWell, what was I to do with these holes? The best I could think of \nwas that maybe the mass was not the same as the mass of the electron.\nAfter all, my primitive theory did ignore the Coulomb forces between \nthe electrons. I did not know how to bring those into the picture, \nand it could be that in some obscure way these Coulomb forces would \ngive rise to a difference in the masses.  \n\nOf course, it is very hard to understand how this difference could be\nso big. We wanted the mass of the proton to be nearly 2000 times the \nmass of the electron, an enormous difference, and it was very hard to\nunderstand how it could be connected with just a sort of perturbation\neffect coming from Coulomb forces between the electrons.  \n\nHowever, I did not want to abandon my theory altogether, and so I put\nit forward as a theory of electrons and protons. Of course I was very\nsoon attacked on this question of the holes having different masses \nfrom the original electrons. I think the most definite attack came \nfrom Weyl, who pointed out that mathematically the holes would have \nto have the same mass as the electrons, and that came to be the \naccepted view. \n\nAt another place Dirac (1971, 52–55) remarks:  \n\nBut still, I thought there might be something in the basic idea and \nso I published it as a theory of electrons and protons, and left it \nquite unexplained how the protons could have such a different mass \nfrom the electrons.  \n\nThis idea was seized upon by Herman [sic] Weyl. He said boldly that \nthe holes had to have the same mass as the electrons. Now Weyl was a \nmathematician. He was not a physicist at all. He was just concerned \nwith the mathematical consequences of an idea, working out what can \nbe deduced from the various symmetries. And this mathematical \napproach led directly to the conclusion that the holes would have to \nhave the same mass as the electrons. Weyl just published a blunt \nstatement that the holes must have the same mass as the electrons and\ndid not make any comments on the physical implications of this \nassertion. Perhaps he did not really care what the physical \nimplications were. He was just concerned with achieving consistent \nmathematics. \n\nDirac’s characterization of Weyl’s unconcern for physics seems unfair\nin light of Weyl’s own statement in the preface of the second edition\nof his book, cited earlier, where he expresses the fear “that \nin the context of this problem, the clouds are rolling together to \nform a new, serious crisis in quantum physics”; Weyl did care \nabout the physics.  \n\nWeyl’s analysis did have a significant impact on the development of \nthe Maxwell-Dirac theory; however, as Coleman and Korté (2001)\nhave argued, Weyl’s early analysis of the transformations \\(\\mathbf{C}, \n\\mathbf{P}, \\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{CPT}\\) was, for the most part, lost to \nsubsequent researchers and had to be essentially re-invented. \nHowever, it should be noted in this context that Schwinger (1988, \n107–129) was greatly influenced by Weyl’s book. Schwinger makes\nparticular reference to Weyl’s work on the discrete symmetries and \nsays that this work “… was the starting point of my own \nconsiderations concerning the connection between spin and statistics,\nwhich culminated in what is now referred to as the TCP—or some\npermutation thereof—theorem”.  \n\nWeyl analyzed the foundations of both the general theory of \nrelativity and the theory of quantum mechanics. For both theories, he\nprovided a coherent exposition of the mathematical structure of the \ntheory, elegant characterizations of the entities and laws postulated\nby the theory and a lucid account of how these postulates explain the\nmost significant, more directly observable, lower-level phenomena. In\nboth cases, he was also concerned with the constructive aspects of \nthe theory, that is, with the extent to which the higher-level \npostulates of the theory are necessary.  \n\nThere is no doubt that with regard to the general theory of \nrelativity, Weyl held strong philosophical views. Some of these views\nare couched in a phenomenological language and reveal Husserl’s \ninfluence on Weyl. Ryckman’s (2005) study The Reign of Relativity\nprovides an extensive account of Weyl’s orientation to Husserl’s\nphenomenology. On the other hand, many of Weyl’s philosophical views \nare couched in an unequivocal empiricist-realist language. For \nexample, Weyl rejected Poincaré’s geometrical conventionalism \nand forcefully argued that the spacetime metric field is physically \nreal, that it is a physically real structural field (Strukturfeld), \nwhich is determined by the physically real causal (conformal) \nstructure and the physically real inertial (projective) structure or \nguiding field (Führungsfeld) of spacetime. He was not deterred \nin putting forward such ontological claims about the metric structure\nof spacetime despite the fact that a complete epistemologically \nsatisfactory solution to the measurement problem for the spacetime \nmetric field was not then available. In the same manner, Weyl \nforcefully advanced a field-body-relationalist ontology of spacetime \nstructure. He argued that a Leibnizian or Einstein-Machian form of \nrelationalism that is based on a pure body ontology, is not tenable, \nindeed is incoherent within the context of general relativity, and he\npresented a reductio argument, the plasticine example, to \nunderscore the necessity of the existence of a physically real \nguiding field in addition to the existence of bodies.  \n\nHowever, in contrast to Weyl’s many philosophical views with regard \nto spacetime theories, Weyl’s philosophical positions regarding the \nstatus of quantum mechanics, while not absent, are not as \ntransparent. There are passages, such as the following ((Weyl, 1931b,\n2 edn, 44), which argue for the reality of photons.  \n\nThe intensity of the monochromatic radiation that is used to generate\nthe photoelectric effect has no influence on the speed with which the\nelectrons are ejected from the metal but affects only the frequency \nof this process. Even with intensities so weak that on the classical \ntheory hours would be required before the electromagnetic energy \npassing through a given atom would attain to an amount equal to that \nof a photon, the effect begins immediately, the points at which it \noccurs being distributed irregularly over the entire metal plate. \nThis fact is a proof of the existence of light quanta that is no less\nmeaningful than the flashes of light on the scintillation screen are \nfor the corpuscular-discontinuous nature of \\(\\alpha\\)-rays. \n\nOn the other hand, Weyl’s (1931b) discussion of the problem of \n‘directional quantization’ in the old quantum theory and \nof the way that this problem is ‘resolved’ in the new \nquantum theory appears to have a distinctly instrumentalist flavour. \nIn a number of places, he describes the essence of the dilemma posed \nby quantum mechanics with a dispassionate precision. Consider, for \nexample, the following (Weyl, 1931b, 2 edn, 67):  \nNatural science has a constructive character. The phenomena with which\nit deals are not independent manifestations or qualities which can be\nread off from nature, but can only be determined by means of an\nindirect method, through interaction with other bodies. Their implicit\ndefinition is bound up with definite natural laws which underlie the\ninteractions. Consider, for example, the introduction of the Galilean\nconcept of mass which essentially comes down to the following indirect\ndefinition: “Each body possesses a momentum, that is, a vector\n\\(m\\overline{v}\\) which has the same direction as its velocity\n\\(\\overline{v}\\)—the scalar factor \\(m\\) is called its mass. The\nlaw of momentum holds, according to which the sum of the momenta\nbefore a reaction between several bodies is the same as the sum of\ntheir momenta after the reaction.” By applying this law to the\nobserved collision phenomena, one obtains data for the determination\nof the relative masses. The scientific consensus was, however, that\nsuch constructive phenomena can nevertheless be attributed to the\nthings themselves even if the manipulations, which alone can lead\nto their recognition, are not being carried out. In Quantum Theory\nwe encounter a fundamental limitation to this epistemological position\nof the constructive natural science. \n\nIt is difficult for many people to accept quantum mechanics as an \nultimate theory without at the same time giving up some form of \nrealism and adopting something like an instrumentalist view of the \ntheory. It is clear that Weyl was fully aware of this state of \naffairs, and yet in all of his published work, he refrained from \nmaking any bold statements of his views on the fundamental questions \nabout quantum reality. He did not vigorously participate in the \ndebate between Einstein and Schrödinger and the Copenhagen \nSchool nor did he offer decisive views concerning, for example, the \nEinstein, Podolsky, Rosen thought experiment or \nSchrödinger’s Cat. Since Weyl held \nstrong philosophical views within the context of the general theory \nof relativity, it is therefore only natural that one might have \nexpected him to take a stand with respect to Schrödinger’s cat \nand whether or not one should be fully satisfied with a theory \naccording to which the cat is neither alive or dead but is in a \nsuperposition of these two states.  \n\nThe reason for Weyl’s seeming reticence concerning the \nontological/epistemological questions about quantum reality was \nalready hinted at in note 5 of §2, where it was suggested that \nWeyl was not especially bothered by the counterintuitive nature of \nquantum mechanics because he held the view that “objective \nreality cannot be grasped directly, but only through the use of \nsymbols”. Although Weyl (1948, 1949a, 1953) did express his \nphilosophical views about quantum theory, he did so cautiously. Weyl \n(1949a, 263) summarizes some of the features of quantum mechanics \nthat he considered of “paramount philosophical \nsignificance”: the measurement problem, the incompatibility of \nquantum physics with classical logic, quantum causality, the \nnon-local nature of quantum mechanics, the Leibniz-Pauli \nExclusion \n Principle[107],\n and the irreducible probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. At the\nend of the summary Weyl remarks:  \n\nIt must be admitted that the meaning of quantum physics, in spite of \nall its achievements, is not yet clarified as thoroughly as, for \ninstance, the ideas underlying relativity theory. The relation of \nreality and observation is the central problem. We seem to need a \ndeeper epistemological analysis of what constitutes an experiment, a \nmeasurement, and what sort of language is used to communicate its \nresult. \n\nAccording to Weyl (1948, 295), both the theory of general relativity \nand quantum mechanics force upon us the realization that \n“instead of a real spatio-temporal material being what remains \nfor us is only a construction in pure symbols”. If it is \nnecessary, Weyl (1948, 302) says, that our scientific grasp of an \nobjective world must not depend on sense qualities, because of their \ninherent subjective nature, then it is for the same reason necessary \nto eliminate space and time. And Descartes gave us the means to do \nthis with his discovery of analytic geometry.  \n\nAs Weyl (1953, 529) observes, when Newton explained the experienced \nworld through the movements of solid particles in space, he rejected \nsense qualities for the construction of the objective world, but he \nheld on to, and used an intuitively given objective space for the \nconstruction of a real world that lies behind the appearances. It was\nLeibniz who recognized the phenomenal character (Phenomenalität)\nof space and time as consisting in the mere ordering of phenomena; \nhowever, space and time themselves do not have an independent \nreality.  \n\nIt is the freely created pure numbers, that is, pure symbols, \naccording to Weyl, which serve as coordinates, and which provide the \nmaterial with which to symbolically construct the objective world. In\nsymbolically constructing the objective world we are forced to \nreplace space and time through a pure arithmetical construct. Instead\nof spacetime points, \\(n\\)-tuples of pure numbers corresponding to\na given coordinate system are used. Weyl (1948, 303) says:  \n\n… the laws of physics are viewed as arithmetic laws between \nnumerical values of variable magnitudes, in which spatial points and \nmoments of time are represented through their numerical coordinates. \nMagnitudes such as the temperature of a body or the field strength of\nan electric field, which have at each spacetime point a definite \nvalue, appear as functions of four variables, the spacetime \ncoordinates \\(x, y, z, t\\). \n\nIn systematic theorizing we construct a formal scaffold that\nconsists of mere symbols, according to Weyl (1948, 311), without \nexplaining initially what the symbols for mass, charge, field \nstrength, etc., mean; and only toward the end do we describe how the \nsymbolic structure connects directly with experience.  \n\nIt is certain, that on the symbolic side, not space and time but four\nindependent variables \\(x, y, z, t\\) appear; \none speaks of space, as one does of sounds and colours, only on the \nside of conscious experience. A monochromatic light signal … has \nnow become a mathematical formula in which a certain symbol \\(F\\),\ncalled electromagnetic field strength, is expressed as a pure \narithmetically constructed function of four other symbols \n\\(x, y, z, t\\), called spacetime coordinates. \n\nAt another place Weyl (1949a, 113) says:  \n\nIntuitive space and intuitive time are thus hardly the adequate \nmedium in which physics is to construct the external world. No less \nthan the sense qualities must the intuitions of space and time be \nrelinquished as its building material; they must be replaced by a \nfour-dimensional continuum in the abstract arithmetical sense. \n\nWeyl’s point is that while space and time exist within the realm of \nconscious experience, or, according to Kant, as \\(a\\) priori\nforms underlying all of our conscious experiences, they are \nunsuited as elements with which to construct the objective world and \nmust be replaced by means of a purely arithmetical symbolic \nrepresentation. All that we are left with, according to Weyl, is \nsymbolic construction. If this still needed any confirmation, Weyl \n(1948, 313) says, it was provided by the theory of relativity and \nquantum \n theory.[108]\n For ease of reference we repeat a citation of Weyl (1988, 4–5) \nin §4.3.1:  \n\nCoordinates are introduced on the Mf [manifold] in the most direct \nway through the mapping onto the number space, in such a way, that \nall coordinates, which arise through one-to-one continuous \ntransformations, are equally possible. With this the coordinate \nconcept breaks loose from all special constructions to which\nit was bound earlier in geometry. In the language of relativity this \nmeans: The coordinates are not measured, their \nvalues are not read off from real measuring rods which react\nin a definite way to physical fields and the metrical structure, \nrather they are a priori placed in the world arbitrarily, in\norder to characterize those physical fields including the metric\nstructure numerically. The metric structure becomes through \nthis, so to speak, freed from space; it becomes an existing field \nwithin the remaining structure-less space. Through this, space as \nform of appearance contrasts more clearly with its real content: The \ncontent is measured after the form is arbitrarily related to \n coordinates.[109] \n\nThe last two sentences in the above quote suggest that, (a) Weyl \nembraces something close to Kant’s position, according to which space\nand time are “a priori forms of appearances”, or\nthat (b) Weyl adheres to a position called spacetime \nsubstantivalism, according to which, in addition to body and \nfields and their relations, there also exists a \n‘container’, the spacetime manifold, and this manifold, \nits points and the manifold differential-topological relations are \nphysically real. However, this interpretation would contradict Weyl’s\nbasic thesis that in the symbolic construction of the objective word \nwe are left with nothing but symbolic arithmetic functional \nrelations. Weyl’s phrases, do not denote either a physically real \ncontainer or something like Kant’s a priori form of \nintuition. They merely denote a conceptual or formal \nscaffolding, a logical space, as it were, whose points \nare represented by purely formal coordinates \\((n\\)-tuple\nof pure numbers). It is such a formal space which is employed by the \ntheorist in the initial stages of constructing an objective world. To\nemphasize, in modelling the objective world the theorist begins by \nconstructing a formal scaffold which consists of mere \nsymbols and formal coordinates, without explaining initially what the\nsymbols for mass, charge, field strength, etc., mean; only toward the\nend does the theorist describe how the symbolic structure connects \ndirectly with experience ((Weyl, 1948, 311)).  \n\nThe four-dimensional space-time continuum must be replaced by a \nfour-dimensional coordinate space \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\). However, the \nsheer arbitrariness with which we assign coordinates does not affect \nthe objective relations and features of the world itself. To the \ncontrary, it is only relative to a symbolic construction or \nmodelling by means of an assignment of coordinates that the state of \nthe world, its relations and properties, can be objectively \ndetermined by means of distinct, reproducible symbols. While our \nimmediate experiences are subjective and absolute, \nour symbolic construction of the objective world is of \nnecessity relative. Weyl (1949a, 116) says:  \n\nWhoever desires the absolute must take the subjectivity and \negocentricity into the bargain; whoever feels drawn toward the \nobjective faces the problem of relativity. \n\nWeyl (1949a, 75) notes, “The objectification, by elimination of\nthe ego and its immediate life of intuition, does not fully succeed, \nand the coordinate system remains as the necessary residue of the \nego-extinction.” However, this residue of ego involvement is \nsubsequently rendered harmless through the principle of \ninvariance. The transition from one admissible coordinate \nsystem to another can be mathematically described, and the natural \nlaws and measurable quantities must be \ninvariant under such transformations. This, Weyl (1948, 336)\nsays, constitutes the general principle of \nrelativity. Weyl (1949a, 104) says:  \n\n… Only such relations will have objective meaning as are \nindependent of the mapping chosen and therefore remain invariant \nunder deformations of the map. Such a relation is, for instance, the \nintersection of two world lines. If we wish to characterize a special\nmapping or a special class of mappings, we must do so in terms of the\nreal physical events and of the structure revealed in them. That is \nthe content of the postulate of general relativity. \nAccording to the special theory of relativity, it \nis possible in particular to construct a map of the world such that \n(1) the world line of each mass point which is subject to no external\nforces appears as a straight line, and (2) the light cone issuing \nfrom an arbitrary world point is represented by a circular cone with \nvertical axis and a vertex angle of 90°. In this \ntheory the inertial and causal structure and hence also the metrical \nstructure of the world have the character of rigidity, they are \nabsolutely fixed once and for all. It is impossible objectively, \nwithout resorting to individual exhibition, to make a narrower \nselection from among the ‘normal mappings’ satisfying the\nabove conditions (1) and (2). \n\nWeyl (1949a, 115) provides an illustration, which shows how a \nmeasurement by observer \\(B\\) of the angular distance \\(\\delta\\) \nbetween two stars \\(\\Sigma\\) and \\(\\Sigma^{*}\\) can be \nconstructed in the four-dimensional number space, and can be \nexpressed as an \n invariant.[110] Figure 15:\nMeasurement of the angular distance \\(\\delta\\) by an observer \\(B\\)\nbetween two stars \n\nIn figure 15 the stars and observer are represented by their world \nlines, and the past light cone \\(K\\) issuing from the observation \nevent \\(O\\) intersects the world lines of the stars \\(\\Sigma\\) and \n\\(\\Sigma^{*}\\) in \\(E\\) and \n\\(E^{*}\\) respectively. The light rays emitted at \n\\(E\\) and \\(E^{*}\\), which arrive at the \nobservation event \\(O\\), are null geodesics laying on the past \nlight cone and are respectively denoted by \\(\\Lambda\\) and \n\\(\\Lambda^{*}\\). This construction of the numerical \nquantity of the angle \\(\\delta\\) observed by \\(B\\) at \\(O\\), which\nis describable in the form of purely arithmetical relations, is \ninvariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations and constitutes \nan objective fact of the \n world.[111] \n\nOn the other hand, the angles between two stars determine the \nobjectively indescribable subjective experience of \nthe observer. Moreover, Weyl says, “there is no difference in \nour experiences to which there does not correspond a difference in \nthe underlying objective situation.” And that difference is \nitself invariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations. In other\nwords, an observer’s subjective experiences supervene on the\ninvariant relationships and structures of a symbolically constructed \nobjective world.  \n\nPerhaps no statement captures the contrast between the \nobjective-symbolic and the subjective-intuitive more vividly then \nWeyl’s famous statement  \n\nThe objective world simply \\(is\\), it does not happen. \nOnly to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling upward along the life \nline of my body, does a section of this world come to life as a \nfleeting image in space which continuously changes in \n time.[112]","contact.mail":"herbert.korte@ubc.ca","contact.domain":"ubc.ca"}]
