It\nis commonly considered a theory of meaning which states that “we\nmean by any concept nothing more than a set of operations; the concept\nis synonymous with the corresponding set of operations”\n(Bridgman 1927, 5). That drastic statement was made in The Logic\nof Modern Physics, published in 1927 by the American physicist P.\nW. Bridgman. The operationalist point of view, first expounded at\nlength in that book, initially found many advocates among practicing\nphysicists and those inspired by the tradition of American pragmatism\nor the new philosophy of logical positivism. It is highly doubtful\nthat Bridgman intended to advance a precise and universal theory of\nmeaning, or any systematic philosophical theory at all. His writings\nwere primarily “reflections of a\n physicist”[1]\n rooted in experimental practice and aimed at articulating the\nscientific method from a first-person point of view. However, as\nBridgman’s ideas gained currency they were shaped into a general\nphilosophical doctrine of “operationalism” or\n“operationism”, and in that form became very influential\nin many areas, especially in methodological debates in psychology.\nBoth in philosophy and in psychology operationalism is nowadays\ncommonly regarded as an extreme and outmoded position, but that is not\nto say that the potential of the early ideas has been exhausted.\n\n\nThis article has three sections, each of which serves a different aim.\nSection 1 introduces Bridgman’s key ideas on operational\nanalysis, explaining their motivations and tracing the course of their\ndevelopment. Section 2 summarizes various critiques of operationalism,\nwhich eventually led to a general philosophical consensus against it.\nSection 3 gives a view on the remaining potential of Bridgman’s\nideas on operational analysis for philosophy of science today.\n\nPercy Williams Bridgman (1882–1961) was a physicist at Harvard\nUniversity whose pioneering work in the physics of high pressures was\nrewarded with a Nobel Prize in\n 1946.[2]\n His chief scientific contribution was made possible by technical\nprowess: in his laboratory Bridgman created pressures nearly 100 times\nhigher than anyone else had achieved before him, and investigated the\nnovel behavior of various materials under such high pressures. But\nBridgman was placed in a predicament by his own achievements: at such\nextreme pressures, all previously known pressure gauges broke down;\nhow was he even to know what levels of pressure he had in fact\nreached? (see Kemble, Birch and Holton 1970) As he kept breaking his\nown pressure records, Bridgman had to establish a succession of new\nmeasures fit for higher and higher pressures. Therefore it is no\nsurprise that he thought seriously about the groundlessness of\nconcepts where no methods were available for their measurement. \nAnother important stimulus to his philosophical thinking was his\nencounter with the revolutionary new physics of the early 20th\ncentury. Bridgman’s concerns about the definition and meaning of\nscientific concepts were forged in the general climate of shock\nsuffered by physicists at that time from a barrage of phenomena and\ntheoretical ideas that were entirely alien to everyday expectations,\nculminating with quantum mechanics and its “Copenhagen”\ninterpretation. In a popular article, Bridgman wrote: “if we\nsufficiently extend our range we shall find that nature is\nintrinsically and in its elements neither understandable nor subject\nto law” (1929, 444). \nEspecially important for Bridgman’s thinking was Albert\nEinstein’s special theory of relativity. Bridgman credited an\nunexpected teaching assignment in 1914 for his first real encounter\nwith special relativity, which gave him considerable distress as he\ntried to clarify the confusing conceptual situation surrounding the\ntheory (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 76). At the heart of special\nrelativity was Einstein’s recognition that judging the\nsimultaneity of two events separated in space required a different\noperation from that required for judging the simultaneity of two\nevents happening at the same place. Fixing the latter operation was\nnot sufficient to fix the former, so a further convention was\nnecessary, which Einstein supplied in the form of his operation of\nsending light beams from each of the events in question to the\nmidpoint between their locations, to see if they arrive there at the\nsame time. How superior this way of thinking was, compared to Isaac\nNewton’s declaration that he would “not define Time,\nSpace, Place or Motion, as being well known to all” (quoted in\nBridgman 1927, 4)! Bridgman felt that all physicists, including\nhimself, had been guilty of unthinking uses of concepts, especially on\nthe theoretical side of physics. \nBridgman’s sentiment arising out of these reflections, however,\nwas not the familiar one of happy celebration of Einstein’s\ngenius. He rather regretted the sorry state of physics which had\nnecessitated Einstein’s revolution. Einstein showed what\ndangerous traps we could fall into by stepping into new domains with\nold concepts in an unreflective way. Anyone thinking in operational\nterms would have recognized from the start that the meaning of\n“distant simultaneity” was not fixed unless an operation\nfor judging it was specified (Bridgman 1927, 10–16). In\nBridgman’s view, Einstein’s revolution would never have\nbeen necessary, if classical physicists had paid operational attention\nto what they were doing. He thought that any future toppling of\nunsound structures would become unnecessary if the operational way of\nthinking could quietly prevent such unsound structures in the first\nplace. Operational awareness was required if physics was not to be\ncaught off-guard again as it had been in 1905: “We must remain\naware of these joints in our conceptual structure if we hope to render\nunnecessary the services of the unborn Einsteins” (Bridgman\n1927, 24). \nBridgman’s impulse was to specify every possible detail of his\noperations, because any detail could make an important\ndifference. Note the following passage, inspired by the shock of\nlearning from the special theory of relativity that the measured\nlength of an object was not independent of its velocity: \nBridgman found that the challenges of the unknown were amply present\neven in very prosaic circumstances. Therefore he chose to open his\ndiscussion of operational analysis in The Logic of Modern\nPhysics (Bridgman 1927) with the example of the most mundane of\nall scientific concepts: length. He was both fascinated and troubled\nby the fact that “essential physical limitations” forced\nscientists to use different measurement operations for the same\nconcept in different domains of phenomena. Length is measured with a\nruler only when we are dealing with dimensions that are comparable to\nour human bodies, and when the objects of measurement are moving\nslowly relative to the measurer. To measure, say, the distance to the\nmoon, we need to infer it from the amount of time that light takes to\ntravel that distance and return, and that is also the procedure taken\nup in Einstein’s theorizing in special relativity; “the\nspace of astronomy is not a physical space of meter sticks, but is a\nspace of light waves” (Bridgman 1927, 67). For even larger\ndistances we use the unit of “light-year,” but we cannot\nactually use the operation of sending off a light beam to a distant\nspeck of light in the sky and waiting for years on end until hopefully\na reflected signal comes back to us (or our descendants). Much more\ncomplex reasoning and operations are required for measuring any\ndistances beyond the solar system: \nThus operational analysis reveals that length is not one homogeneous\nconcept that applies straightforwardly in the whole range of cases in\nwhich we use it: \nIn practice scientists do not recognize multiple concepts of length,\nand Bridgman was willing to concede that it was allowable to use the\nsame name to represent a series of concepts, if the different\nmeasurement operations gave mutually consistent numerical results in\nthe areas of overlap: \nHowever, such numerical convergence between the results of two\ndifferent operations was regarded by Bridgman as merely a\n“practical justification for retaining the same name” for\nwhat the two operations measured (Bridgman 1927, 16). \nEven in such convergent situations, we have to be wary of the danger\nof slipping into conceptual confusion through the use of the same word\nto refer to the subjects of different operations. If we do not temper\nour thoughts with the operationalist conscience always referring us\nback to concrete measurement operations, we may get into the sloppy\nhabit of using one word for all sorts of different situations (without\neven checking for the required convergence in the overlapping\ndomains). Bridgman warned: “our verbal machinery has no built-in\ncutoff” (1959a, 75). Similarly we could be misled by the\nrepresentation of a concept as a number into thinking that there is\nnaturally an infinitely extendable scale for that concept, since the\nreal-number line continues on to infinity. It would also be easy to\nthink that physical quantities must meaningfully exist down to\ninfinite precision, just because the numerical scale we have pinned on\nthem is infinitely divisible. Bridgman issued a stark reminder: \nBridgman thus emphasized that our concepts did not automatically\nextend beyond the domains in which they were originally defined. He\nwarned that concepts in far-out domains could easily become\nmeaningless for lack of applicable measurement operations. The case of\nlength in the very small scale makes that danger clear. Beyond the\nresolution of the eye, the ruler has to be given up in favor of\nvarious micrometers and microscopes. When we get to the realm of atoms\nand elementary particles, it is not clear what operations could be\nused to measure length, and not even clear what “length”\nmeans any more. \nAfter introducing operational analysis with that refreshing discussion\nof the length concept, Bridgman published a long series of critical\nre-assessments of various fundamental physical concepts. His\nruminations on length were extended into general commentary on the\nnature of space, and the concept of time received a similar treatment.\nHis views on space and time were reminiscent of Henri\nPoincaré’s and Pierre Duhem’s: Bridgman noted that\nclocks had to be used in the empirical determination of the basic laws\nof physics, while our confidence that a clock ticks regularly was\nfounded in the basic laws of physics governing its mechanism. Suppose\nwe are trying to test the general theory of relativity by measuring\nthe red-shift of light coming out of a heavy body: \nBridgman found these reflections liberating as well as troubling.\nBasic space-time concepts are not uniquely determined a\npriori. For example, he noted that the notion of velocity common\nto classical mechanics and special relativity was not the only one in\nline with our intuitions of what velocity meant. Consider this\nalternative: “a traveler in an automobile measures his velocity\nby observing the clock on his instrument board and the mile stones\nwhich he passes on the road.” If we adopt such a procedure we\nwill find that the speed of light is infinite, if special relativity\nis correct about time dilation: with the car going at the speed of\nlight according to an observer standing on the road, the clock on the\ncar will not advance at all while the car passes any number of\nmilestones. This alternative concept of velocity would have the\nadvantage that “there would be no limit to the velocity which\ncan be imparted to material bodies on giving them unlimited\nenergy”, which seems intuitively “natural and\nsimple”. But assigning an infinite velocity to light is also\n“most unnatural, particularly if we favor a medium point of\nview.” So there was a dilemma: “all sorts of phenomena\ncannot at the same time be treated simply.” (Bridgman 1927,\n98–100) \nIn the latter parts of The Logic of Modern Physics Bridgman\ngave a fascinating array of discussions on the concepts of force,\nmass, energy, light and field, and the theories of thermodynamics,\nrelativity and quantum mechanics. These thoughts were developed\nfurther in the remaining decades of his life, and collected in\nsubsequent volumes including The Nature of Physical Theory\n(1936), The Nature of Thermodynamics (1941), Reflections\nof a Physicist (1950, second edition 1955), The Nature of\nSome of Our Physical Concepts (1952), and The Way Things\nAre (1959a). Bridgman made a searching examination of the\nfamiliar concepts of classical physics, checking to see if they\nretained operational meaning in domains of phenomena that were\nunfamiliar to the creators of classical physics. In some cases his\nanalysis showed that the classical concepts were operationally unsound\neven in the contexts in which they were originally created. Later in\nlife he stated that his initial foray into philosophy was motivated by\nhis “disquietude” about physics, especially\nelectrodynamics and thermodynamics, in which “the fundamental\nunderstanding of even the acknowledged leaders in physics were\ninadequate” (Bridgman 1959b, 519). In contrast, he thought that\non the whole the contemporary development of quantum theory went in\nthe right direction, especially in Werner Heisenberg’s version\nof it, which discarded classical concepts where they did not apply\n(e.g., space-time orbits for electrons), and crafted new concepts with\nclear operational meaning in new domains of phenomena. However, he was\nnot entirely satisfied with Niels Bohr’s doctrine that all the\noperations of physics needed to be explained in the “macroscopic\nlanguage of daily life or of present-day philosophy”; rather, he\nthought we needed to develop a “more adequate macroscopic\nlanguage” (1959b, 526). \nInterestingly, Bridgman never stopped thinking about relativity. The\noperationalist lesson he had taken from Einstein was so dear to him\nthat he did not shrink from criticizing Einstein himself when the\nlatter seemed to betray his own principles in the general theory of\nrelativity. Already in The Logic of Modern Physics he had\nopined: “I personally question whether the elements of\nEinstein’s formulation, such as curvature of space-time, are\nclosely enough connected with immediate physical experience ever to be\naccepted as an ultimate in a scheme of explanation, and I very much\nfeel the need for a formulation in more intimate physical terms”\n(1927, 176). Years later, when Bridgman was invited by P. A. Schilpp\nto contribute to the Library of Living Philosophers volume on\nEinstein, he issued the following “indictment” against\nEinstein: “he has carried into general relativity theory\nprecisely that uncritical, pre-Einsteinian point of view which he has\nso convincingly shown us, in his special theory, conceals the\npossibility of disaster” (Bridgman 1949a, 354; reprinted in\nBridgman 1955, 337). Einstein brushed aside Bridgman’s\nobjection, merely stating that for a formal system to qualify as a\nphysical theory it was “not necessary to demand that all of its\nassertions can be independently interpreted and ‘tested’\n‘operationally’” (Einstein in Schilpp 1949, 679).\nThis exchange is reminiscent of how Einstein responded with bemused\nincomprehension to Heisenberg’s protest that he was following\nEinstein’s own lesson in treating only directly observable\nquantities in his matrix mechanics (Heisenberg 1971, 62–69).\nBridgman also carried out further operational analysis of special\nrelativity, and his late thoughts on the subject were published\nposthumously in A Sophisticate’s Primer on Relativity\n(1962). \nBridgman’s critique of concepts in physics also led naturally to\na philosophical critique of some general conceptions underlying\nphysics, such as simplicity, atomism, causality, determinism, and\nprobability. He also gave critical considerations to mathematics and\nits application to the physical world. There was no stone Bridgman was\nwilling to leave unturned in his relentless critique. He went as far\nas to declare: “arithmetic, so far as it purports to deal with\nactual physical objects, is also affected with the same penumbra of\nuncertainty as all other empirical science” (Bridgman 1927,\n34). \nAmong physicists Bridgman’s reflections found a strong echo,\nespecially in the early days. Perhaps that was natural: it has been\nsaid, by Bridgman himself too, that operationalism arose from\nobserving “physicists in action” (Bridgman in Frank 1956,\n80). Gerald Holton (1995a, 224) recalls what an “electrifying\nexperience” it was for himself and many other physicists to read\nThe Logic of Modern Physics for the first time, but explains\nthat the “immense power” of Bridgman’s work is\n“not that the work brings to the reader a message never thought\nof before, but that it lays open, with clarity, what the reader has\nbeen trying to formulate on his or her own”. In Mary\nHesse’s view Bridgman only gave “the most explicit\nformulation” of a common view, which was shared even by Arthur\nEddington, whose metaphysical musings about physics Bridgman took a\nstrong exception to: “A physical quantity is defined by the\nseries of operations and calculations of which it is the result”\n(quoted in Hesse 1952, 218). \nBridgman’s philosophical views, however, were not just an\narticulation of views widely shared by physicists. Albert E. Moyer\n(1991) stresses that Bridgman’s operational analysis served the\nfunction of making special relativity and quantum mechanics more\npalatable by showing how they could be understood in a way that most\nphysicists could cope with. But the operational way of rendering the\nnew physics was not agreeable to all physicists (or philosophers of\nphysics), although it was consonant with the stances taken by some\nleaders in the field including Bohr, Heisenberg and Oppenheimer (Moyer\n1991, 376, 389). We have already seen Einstein’s objections to\nBridgman’s interpretation of relativity. Mario Bunge (1988)\nargues that operationalism is “written into the standard (or\nCopenhagen) interpretation of the quantum theory”, but that this\ninterpretation gives a clear misrepresentation of the actual practices\nin quantum physics. Analyzing Dirac’s version of the theory,\nHesse (1952) concluded that concepts of quantum theory did not have\nsimple operational meanings, and Dirac’s\n“observables” were concepts without operational\ndefinitions. Rather, in Hesse’s view, concepts in such\nsituations only derived their meanings from theoretical analogies. \nBridgman also extended his operationalist thinking by considering its\nimplications outside physics. This was important to him at least from\nthe time of The Logic of Modern Physics, in which he\nventured: “many of the questions asked about social and\nphilosophical subjects will be found to be meaningless when examined\nfrom the point of operations. It would doubtless conduce greatly to\nclarity of thought if the operational mode of thinking were adopted in\nall fields of inquiry as well as in the physical” (30–32).\nTo Bridgman it was clear that “to adopt the operational point of\nview … means a far-reaching change in all our habits of\nthought”. He knew that in practice this would be a very\ndifficult thing to do: “Operational thinking will at first prove\nto be an unsocial virtue; one will find oneself perpetually unable to\nunderstand the simplest conversation of one’s friends, and will\nmake oneself universally unpopular by demanding the meaning of\napparently the simplest terms of every argument”. Perhaps this\nthrowaway remark was a sign of things to come, as Bridgman would in\nthe end find himself rather isolated and plagued by misunderstanding,\neven among those who found his philosophical ideas worth discussing,\nas we will see in Section 2. \nBridgman did not develop in detail his operationalist ideas in\nrelation to any other science than physics, apparently content to\nleave that job to the specialists in the respective fields. Some other\nscientists and philosophers did take up Bridgman’s call for\noperationalist reforms, with interesting consequences. Now, it would\nbe fair to say that operationalism did not change the practice of\nphysics itself drastically from what it would have been anyway, and\nmost physicists followed him only as far as he asserted what was\ncommon sense to them. The situation was perhaps similar in other\nphysical sciences, too. For example, operational thinking has always\nbeen an important part of chemistry, sometimes explicitly so, for\nexample in Lavoisier’s famous “operational”\ndefinition of a chemical element as a substance that has not yet been\ndecomposed further. David Hull (1968) indicates that some key terms in\nbiology has been criticised for not being operational, and calls for a\nnuanced view on the matter. Hugh Petrie (1971) laments that a\npositivist dogma originating from a misunderstanding of operationalism\nhas had a negative influence on the social sciences. Moyer (1991,\n393–394) records Bridgman’s influence on the University of\nChicago economist Henry Schultz, and the strong and explicit\noperationalist orientation of Paul Samuelson’s early work. Paul\nMarshall (1979) argues, with particular attention to political\nscience, that operationalism has left a methodological legacy in the\nsocial sciences lasting well beyond its decline within the philosophy\nof science. \nThe field that was most significantly and expressly affected by\noperationalism was psychology. Behaviorist psychologists took up\noperationalism (or operationism, as it was more often called\nin psychology) as a weapon in their fight against more traditional\npsychologists, especially those who prized introspection as the most\nimportant source of psychological knowledge. The Harvard psychologist\nEdwin Boring (1886–1968) saw Bridgman’s philosophy as a\nmodern substitute for positivism, and he seems to have coined the term\n“operationism” (see Walter 1990, 178). It was\nBoring’s student Stanley Smith Stevens (1906–1973) who was\nperhaps the most aggressive promoter of operationism in psychology\n(Hardcastle 1994; Feest 2005). Stevens saw operationism as a sure\nmethod of increasing rigor in psychological experiments and discourse,\nasserting that “to experience is, for the purpose of science, to\nreact discriminately”, since these reactions are what science\ncan measure and record publically (quoted in Feest 2005, 136). Echoing\nBridgman’s take on Einstein, Stevens declared in 1935:\n“The revolution that will put an end to the possibility of\nrevolutions is the one that defines a straightforward procedure for\nthe definition and validation of concepts. … Such a procedure\nis the one which tests the meaning of concepts by appealing to the\nconcrete operations by which the concept is determined. We may call it\noperationism” (quoted in Walter 1990, 180). \nIn his concrete research in psychology Stevens focused on\npsychophysics, starting with his Ph.D. dissertation on the perceived\nattributes of tones, written under Boring’s supervision. Another\nnotable operationist in psychology was Edward Chace Tolman\n(1886–1959), also a Harvard Ph.D., who taught for most of his\nlife at the University of California at Berkeley. Starting with his\nresearch on problem-solving behavior in rats, Tolman gave an\noperational treatment of desire, for example operationalizing hunger\nin terms of “time since last feeding”. Tolman did not deny\nthat hunger was a subjective feeling, nor was it the main object of\nhis research, but insisted that controlling for degrees of hunger in\nhis experiments required tractable operations that would allow\nscientists to get a hold on something related to that subjective\nexperience (see Feest 2005, 136–138). In Gustav Bergmann’s\nassessment, operationism helped behaviorism to move from its initial\nmetaphysical Watsonian variety to its modern version (Bergmann in\nFrank 1956, 53). \nDespite the strong popularity of operationist behaviorism in certain\nquarters, it never commanded a complete consensus even in American\npsychology. Perhaps the most unexpected opposition came from Bridgman\nhimself. Behaviorists were wanting to use operations to attain\nobjectivity in psychology, which for them meant taking psychological\ndiscourse away from attempts to describe private experience. This was\njust the wrong move in Bridgman’s view, as we will see in more\ndetail in Section 2.4 below. Bridgman engaged in some discussion with\nStevens but discovered that the latter’s enthusiasm for\n“operational ideas” was really for something that he could\nnot agree with. By 1936 he declared privately: “I have rather\nwashed my hands of him” (quoted in Walter 1990, 184).\nBridgman’s disagreement with B. F. Skinner (1904–1990) was\neven more severe, and resulted in a prolonged dispute between the two\n(Holton 2005; Walter 1990, 188–192). Operationism became a\nsubject of great controversy in psychology, epitomized in a 1945\nspecial issue of the Psychological Review devoted to a\nsymposium on operationism suggested by Boring, who remained supportive\nof the movement at some critical distance. \nUljana Feest considers that operationism did leave a lasting and\npositive legacy in psychology. The maxim of operationism dictates that\npsychologists should provide concepts with operational definitions by\nspecifying paradigmatic experimental conditions for their application,\nand this remains a useful methodological tenet (Feest 2011, 403). In\nFeest’s view a sufficiently sophisticated understanding of\noperationism in psychology was only reached by the second generation\nof operationists, who consciously employed what she calls the\nmethodological (rather than positivist) reading of operationism.\nFeest’s analysis reinforces R. C. Grace’s (2001)\nview that the early operationist psychologists made the mistake of\nadopting a very restrictive version of Bridgman’s ideas, but\nthat this mistake was corrected in the 1950s with the adoption of\n“multiple” or “convergent” operationism. These\nsophisticated operationists did not take operational definitions to\ngive full and fixed meanings of concepts, but used them as provisional\ntools aiding their scientific investigations. As Feest puts it:\n“I believe that in offering operational definitions, scientists\nwere partially and temporarily specifying their usage of\ncertain concepts by saying which kinds of empirical indicators they\ntook to be indicative of the referents of the\nconcepts.”(Feest 2005, 133; emphases original) \nDespite the initial popularity of Bridgman’s ideas, by the\nmiddle of the 20th century the common reactions among philosophers and\nphilosophically-minded scientists were strongly critical.\nOperationalism received many high-profile debates, among them a\nsymposium held at the annual meeting of the American Association for\nthe Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 1953 (published in Frank 1956),\nand the Psychological Review issue mentioned above. On such\noccasions Bridgman attempted to refine and defend his views, but also\nfound that the debate was moving in directions that both surprised and\ndisturbed him. In his contribution to the AAAS symposium he\nexclaimed: \nStill, arguably it was not Bridgman’s own ideas about\noperational analysis but the Frankenstein of operationalism that had a\nmore significant impact in philosophy and science, so this survey of\noperationalism must deal with how other people responded to\noperationalism as they saw it. In the course of the discussion I will\ntry to point out some places where there were clear misunderstandings\nof Bridgman’s ideas, and also other places where Bridgman\nhimself was ambivalent or ambiguous, rather than simply\nmisunderstood. \nGiven the timing and contexts of the publication of Bridgman’s\nideas, the philosophical debates surrounding them were to a large\nextent framed in relation to logical positivism, which was just making\nits big impact on the American philosophical scene. The young Herbert\nFeigl (1902–1988), with a personal introduction by no less than\nMoritz Schlick, came to Harvard in 1930 with the express purpose of\nlearning from Bridgman, despite the latter’s warning that he did\nnot have much to teach (Walter 1990, 164–165; Moyer 1991, 391).\nBridgman’s insistence on operational meaningfulness had at least\na surface resemblance to the logical positivists’ verification\ntheory of meaning. Bergmann thought Bridgman had given a\n“scientist’s version” of the latter (Bergmann in\nFrank 1956, 55), and Carl Hempel regarded operationalism and logical\npositivism as “closely akin” to each other (Hempel in\nFrank 1956, 56). And it is not difficult to see how a kindred\nphilosophical doctrine coming from a world-class scientist would have\ncaptured the logical positivists’ imagination. \nWhen subjected to the scrutiny of professional philosophers, however,\nBridgman’s ideas were soon exposed as unsystematic and\nundeveloped, as he freely admitted himself. Moreover, it became\nevident that his ideas did not help logical positivists solve the key\nproblems that they were struggling with. After the initial\nfascination, the standard positivist (and post-positivist) reaction to\noperationalism was disappointment, and operationalism was often seen\nas a failed philosophy that did not live up to its promises. \nNowhere was the positivist disappointment with Bridgman sharper than\nin considerations of operationalism as a theory of meaning. There was\na set of objections which together amounted to a complaint that\noperational definitions did not give a sufficient account of the\nmeaning of concepts, even where there were operations clearly relevant\nto the concepts in question. \nThe core of the problem here is an overly restrictive notion of\nmeaning, which reduces it to measurement; I will call this\nBridgman’s reductive doctrine of meaning. Although\nBridgman was not proposing a general philosophical theory of meaning,\nhe did make remarks that revealed an impulse to do so. Consider the\nfollowing statement, the last part of which I have already quoted: \nSimilarly, he also displayed an impulse to use operations to make a\ncriterion of meaningfulness: “If a specific question has\nmeaning, it must be possible to find operations by which an answer may\nbe given to it.” (Bridgman 1927, 28) \nOne lesson we can take from Bridgman’s troubles is that meaning\nis unruly and promiscuous. The kind of absolute control on the meaning\nof scientific concepts that Bridgman wished for is not possible. The\nmost control that can be achieved is for the scientific community to\nagree on an explicit definition and to respect it. But even firm\ndefinitions can only constrain the uses of a concept. The entire world\ncan agree to define length by the standard meter in Paris (or by the\nwavelength of a certain atomic radiation), and that still comes\nnowhere near exhausting all that we mean by length. Bridgman\nhimself later specifically admitted that his statement that meanings\nwere synonymous with operations was “obviously going too far\nwhen taken out of context” (1938, 117). Especially compared with\nthe notion of “meaning as use,” often traced back to the\nlater phase of Ludwig Wittgenstein’s\n work,[3]\n it is easy to recognize the narrowness of Bridgman’s initial\nideas. Bridgman’s later gloss on his ideas was in fact rather\nlate-Wittgensteinian: “To know the meaning of a term used by me\nit is evident, I think, that I must know the conditions under which I\nwould use the term” (1938, 116). As measurement operations\nprovide only one specific context in which a concept is used,\noperational definitions can only cover one particular aspect of\nmeaning. \nRecognizing the restrictiveness of Bridgman’s early remarks on\nmeaning gives us a useful framework for understanding one common\nobjection to operationalism. As Donald Gillies (1972, 6–7)\nemphasizes, if we accept the most extreme kind of operationalism,\nthere is no point in asking whether a measurement method is valid; if\nthe measurement method defines the concept and there is nothing more\nto the meaning of the concept, the measurement method is automatically\nvalid, as a matter of convention or even tautology. Metrological\nvalidity becomes an interesting question only if the concept possesses\na broader meaning than the specification of the method of its\nmeasurement. Not only Bridgman himself but the second-generation\noperationist psychologists recognized this point very clearly, in\ntheir discussions of construct validity (see, for example, Cronbach\nand Meehl 1955). The measurement method can be said to be valid if it\ncoheres with the other aspects of the concept’s meaning. That\nway we may also make a judgment about whether an operational\ndefinition (or any other kind of definition) is an appropriate one,\ndepending on how well it coheres with other elements of the\nconcept’s meaning and how beneficially it controls other\nelements of meaning. \nSo far I have noted that an operational definition is not sufficient\nto express a concept’s meaning fully. Going further than that,\nmany critics of operationalism have argued that not every good\nscientific concept needs to have an operational definition. If\noperationalism means demanding that every concept and every\ninferential step should have an immediate operational significance, it\nconstitutes an overly restrictive empiricism. At times Bridgman did\nappear to be making such a demand, as illustrated in the poignant\nepisode (discussed in Section 1.3 above) in which he criticized\nEinstein for betraying his own operationalist lesson in the general\ntheory of relativity. Einstein’s view was that there was no\nreason for physicists to shrink from using a non-operational concept\nif that delivered good results. \nEinstein was self-consciously opportunistic in his methodological\neclecticism, but philosophers wanted to find a more general rationale\nfor freeing scientific theorizing from operationalist\nmicro-management. The crux of the problem here for the operationalist\nis that theoretical concepts are much too useful in science. Bridgman\nactually acknowledged from early on that there were good theoretical\nconcepts that were not amenable to direct operationalization,\nillustrating the point with the example of stress and strain inside a\nsolid body (1927, 53–54), and the wavefunction in quantum\nmechanics (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 79). Bridgman saw clearly that\nthese theoretical concepts only had indirect connections with physical\noperations, but he did not see any problems with that. He in fact went\nso far as to say: “there need be no qualms that the operational\npoint of view will ever place the slightest restriction on the freedom\nof the theoretical physicist to explore the consequences of any free\nmental construction” (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 79; see also\nBridgman 1949b, 256). All that was required was that the theoretical\nsystem touched the operational ground somewhere, eventually. However,\nin that case Bridgman’s message was the same as\nEinstein’s, as the physicist R. B. Lindsay pointed out (Lindsay\nin Frank 1956, 71–72). \nBridgman’s position on the matter of theoretical concepts was\ncomplicated, and perhaps not entirely self-consistent (I will return\nto this point in Section 3.3). One common objection to operationalism\nis based on a misunderstanding that reveals an essential difference\nbetween Bridgman and most of his critics. It is often said that\noperationalism cannot be right because each scientific concept can be\nmeasured in various ways. This criticism is based on the presumption\nthat the concept in question has unity, which means that its\ndefinition must also be unified. If there are a variety of measurement\nmethods all of which apply to one concept, then measurement methods\ncannot be what supplies the unified definition; instead, some\ntheoretical account must be given as to how the variety of operations\nunder consideration serve to measure the same thing. Bridgman, in\ncontrast, had no such presumption of conceptual unity. For him, the\ninitial position to take was that if there are different methods of\nmeasurement we have different concepts, as he said about\n“tactual” and “optical” length being two\ndifferent concepts. Now, it could be that there is one aspect\nof reality that different measurement operations all get at, but that\nis something to be demonstrated, not to be assumed at the outset. The\npossibility of unity can be entertained if the minimum condition of\nnumerical convergence is met—that is, if two measurement\noperations have an overlapping range and their results agree in the\noverlap. Still, Bridgman maintained some skepticism about whether it\nwas safe for us to infer real conceptual unity from such numerical\nconvergence. \nBridgman’s ambivalence about conceptual unity elicited a serious\nworry about the systematic import of scientific concepts and theories,\nmost astutely expressed by Hempel (1966, 91–97).\nBridgman’s skeptical caution would result in an intolerable\nfragmentation of science, Hempel argued. It would result in “a\nproliferation of concepts of length, of temperature, and of all other\nscientific concepts that would not only be practically unmanageable,\nbut theoretically endless.” Hempel’s worry was that\nBridgman’s quest for safety was blinding him to one of the\nultimate aims of science, “namely the attainment of a simple,\nsystematically unified account of empirical phenomena” (Hempel\n1966, 94). Along similar lines, Lindsay (1937, 458) had earlier argued\nthat “such an isolation of concepts would defeat the very aim of\nphysical science, which is to provide a simple and economical\ndescription” of physical experience “in terms of a minimum\nnumber of concepts”. Bridgman had serious doubts about the\nplausibility of such a simple, unified account of nature, as I will\nexplain further in Section 3.4. But Hempel and others could genuinely\nenvisage it. Hempel noted that with the development of science there\nwas a continually growing and thickening network of “nomic\nthreads” linking various “knot-concepts” with each\nother as further empirical laws were discovered. Hempel argued that it\nwas essential to keep this thickening conceptual network systematic\nand simple; to that end, “concept formation and theory formation\nmust go hand in hand” (Hempel 1966, 97). That, in turn, often\nnecessitated “a modification of the operational criteria\noriginally adopted for some of the central concepts” (Hempel\n1966, 95). Operationalism would stand in the way of such\nflexibility. \nApart from the questions of whether operational definitions are\nsufficient or necessary, it is actually unclear what types of things\noperations are, and how they should be specified. This\nproblem was noted and discussed quite early on (see, for example,\nHearnshaw 1941). The surface-level intuition is simple: the operations\nthat matter are measurement operations involving physical instruments.\nBut from the start Bridgman (1927, 5) also stated that the operations\nwhich fixed meaning were mental if the concepts in question were\nmental (e.g., in mathematics). And he knew that measurement operations\ninvolved more than physical manipulations of instruments; at least\nthere are recordings and computations involved in the processing and\nanalysis of data, and there are mental acts linking various parts of\nthat complex procedure, too. To take the simplest example, the\noperation of counting is a mental operation, but it is an integral\npart of many “physical” procedures. He called such crucial\nnon-physical operations “paper-and-pencil” operations.\nBridgman lamented that it was the “most wide spread\nmisconception with regard to the operational technique” to think\nthat it demanded that all concepts in physics must find their meaning\nonly in terms of physical operations in the laboratory (Bridgman 1938,\n122–124; also Bridgman 1959b, 522). Later he gave a rough\nclassification of operations into the instrumental, mental/verbal, and\npaper-and-pencil varieties (Bridgman 1959a, 3). \nThis issue becomes sharper when we ask the question of purpose: what\nare the aims of operational analysis, and which operations are\nsuitable for achieving those aims? Having distinguished various types\nof operations, Bridgman also had to deal with the question of whether\nthe different types had different epistemic values, going beyond his\ninitial intuitive fondness for instrumental operations. For example,\nif the point of operationalizing a concept was to make its meaning\nclear and precise, which meant using “operations which can be\nunequivocally performed” (Bridgman 1938, 119), then why were\npaper-and-pencil operations such as the construction of Euclidean\ngeometric figures not just as good as instrumental operations? In the\nend he was willing to dispense with any ultimate privileging of\ninstrumental operations. But he still maintained a preference for them\nwhen possible, without giving a convincing reason for that preference\n(Bridgman 1938, 127). \nThus Bridgman’s position on the nature and function of\noperations was uneasy from start to finish. Various critics rightly\nzeroed in on this point. The most important point of contention was\nwhether and why physical or instrumental operations had any special\nepistemic advantage. The Yale physicist Henry Margenau put the point\nsuccinctly: \nAs one can imagine, this dilemma also hampered attempts to use\noperational analysis in psychology. Operations in psychological\nresearch inevitably involved verbal instructions, reports and\nreactions. It was difficult to argue that these mental or verbal\noperations were superior in reliability or meaningfulness to the\nintrospective reporting of mental states, which operationists tried so\nhard to exclude from scientific psychology. \nBridgman himself was troubled by the question regarding the nature of\noperations and admitted late in his life that he had not really\nprovided “an analysis of what it is that makes an operation\nsuitable”, or “in what terms can operations be\nspecified” (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 77). An even deeper\npessimism was expressed in Bridgman’s 30-year retrospective on\nThe Logic of Modern Physics, commissioned for\nDaedalus by Holton: “To me now it seems\nincomprehensible that I should ever have thought it within my powers\n… to analyze so thoroughly the functioning of our thinking\napparatus that I could confidently expect to exhaust the subject and\neliminate the possibility of a bright new idea against which I would\nbe defenseless” (Bridgman 1959b, 520). \nOne last issue needs to be mentioned, before I complete the discussion\nof the critique of operationalism: the privacy of operations. This is\nperhaps not widely remembered now, but it was the issue on which\nBridgman’s position elicited the most severe incomprehension and\nobjection, even from many who called themselves operationalists. \nThe emblematic moment in this dispute came during the 5th\nInternational Congress for the Unity of Science in 1939, held at\nHarvard University—one of the highpoints of the activities of\nthe “Vienna Circle in exile” in America (see Holton\n1995b). Bridgman was invited to address this conference, and chose to\ngive a talk entitled “Science: Public or\n Private?”.[4]\n At this point it became clear that his enterprise was fundamentally\nat odds with the logical positivist project, despite the surface\nkinship: \nPositivists and behaviorists had embraced operationalism for precisely\nthe opposite reason: they thought operations were public, objective\nand verifiable, unlike private experience. But Bridgman was insistent\nthat operations were a matter for private experience. He could see no\nwarrant in simply taking someone else’s testimony as true or\nreliable, or in regarding the report of an operation performed by\nsomeone else as the same kind of thing as an operation performed and\nexperienced by himself. In a later paper called “New Vistas for\nIntelligence” he declared: “Science is not truly objective\nunless it recognizes its own subjective or individual aspects”\n(Bridgman 1955, 556). As Holton puts it (2005, 74), Bridgman’s\ndrive in operational analysis was “to throw the spotlight on\nperformable action, above all an action performed by himself.\nUltimately, he was a private man, so much so that he was accused of\nsolipsism, to which he scarcely objected.” In his epistemic\nindividualism Bridgman was perhaps only matched by Herbert Dingle, the\nfounder of the British Society for the Philosophy of Science, among\nnotable 20th-century philosophers of science (see Dingle 1950). \nBridgman’s individualistic bent, both in epistemology and social\nlife, was in stark contrast to the logical positivist vision of\nknowledge and society, particularly the strand of positivism driven by\nOtto Neurath (1882–1945). The latter’s aversion to the\nprivate compelled him to express even first-hand observation reports\nas third-person happenings in space and time, of the following type:\n“Otto’s protocol at 3:17 o’clock: [Otto’s\nspeech-thinking at 3:16 o’clock was: (at 3:15 o’clock\nthere was a table in the room perceived by Otto)].” (Neurath\n1932–33 [1983, p. 93]). Bridgman was unyielding in his\nopposition to Neurath’s type of objectification of personal\nexperience. To him, operations provided the best possible refuge from\nthe ocean of uncertainty always threatening to engulf science, and the\nrelative certainty was only possible if he was learning from his own\noperations, not from second-hand reports from some other person. In\nthis regard Bridgman was closer to the strand of logical positivism\nrepresented by Moritz Schlick (1882–1936), who insisted on\nmaintaining the notion of direct experience as the final arbiter of\nknowledge. Schlick (1930 [1979]) admitted that experience was fleeting\nand only provided momentary points of verification rather than any\nlasting “foundation” one could build knowledge on.\nBridgman’s operations had more promise in this regard, as the\noperations were meant to be repeatable so the descriptions of\noperations and their results would be lasting. However, that was not\nto be such a straightforward matter, as we will see in Section\n3.4. \nAs Holton (1995a; 2005) reports from his first-hand observations, the\nprivacy of operations (and the consequent privacy of science) was not\nan idle philosophical doctrine for Bridgman. In the lab he carried out\nas much of the work as possible with his own hands, using few\nassistants and crafting most of his instruments himself. Holton\n(1995a, 222–223) quotes the following report as typical of the\nway Bridgman worked: “It is easy, if all precautions are\nobserved, to drill a hole … 17 inches long, in from 7 to 8\nhours”—that is, a hole as narrow as the lead in a pencil,\nin a block of very hard steel. In academic life Bridgman (1955, 44)\nopenly lamented the “intellectual fashion … of\nemphasizing that all our activities are fundamentally social in\nnature”. As for his social and political writings, they were\noften agonizing attempts to clarify, for himself, the place of the\n“intelligent individual” in society. He was unabashedly\nelitist, both on behalf of the gifted individual and of scientists as\na group, and argued that giving appropriate special treatment to\nscientists would in the end benefit society (that is, all the\nindividuals in society). Maila Walter observes (1990, 192–193):\n“Within the community of scientists and scientific philosophers,\nBridgman had become the lone spokesman for a radical existential\nsubjectivism”, more akin to Rheinhold Niebuhr’s\nexistentialist theology than to any commonly recognized philosophy of\nscience. Bridgman’s uncompromising individualism continued right\nto the end, with a self-administered euthanasia in the late stage of a\npainful terminal illness (see Holton 1995a, 226–227). \nIs operationalism only a historical curiosity? In this final section,\nI would like to give a synoptic view of the relevance of\noperationalism to some issues that are current in philosophy of\nscience. \nAs already noted, Bridgman’s ideas first gained recognition in\nthe midst of the logical-positivist preoccupation with language and\nmeaning; therefore, operationalism was taken primarily as a doctrine\nabout meaning and, as such, shown to be inadequate. In that context,\nit was reasonable for most philosophers to abandon it. Bridgman made\nvarious attempts to get beyond the popular caricature of\noperationalism adopted by advocates and critics alike. These attempts\nnever received sufficient attention, but they offer some valuable\nlessons and show many productive directions in which his views can be\ninterpreted and extended. \nIt is useful to continue listening to his retrospective given in the\n1953 AAAS conference, quoted earlier. Bridgman tells us that what he\nadvocated was merely: \nAlready in his paper on “Operational Analysis” Bridgman\n(1938, 115–116) had stated that in the attempt to understand how\nscience works, “the subject matter … is activity of one\nsort or another”. He equated “activity” and\n“operations”, the term “operation” only\naccentuating the directedness of the activity in question. In his last\ngeneral philosophical treatise, The Way Things Are, Bridgman\ncame back to this theme and stated that an operational analysis was\nonly “a particular case of an analysis in terms of\nactivities—doings or happenings”, instead of analysis\n“in terms of objects or static abstractions”, or “in\nterms of things or static elements” (1959a, 3; also 1959b,\n522). \nIf we take our inspiration from this later Bridgman, we can take him\nas a guide for a new practice-oriented philosophy of science. We can\nput aside his reductive doctrine of meaning, his puritanical search\nfor certainty, and his ambivalent privileging of instrumental\noperations over other types of operations. What Bridgman started up\nbut never quite accomplished in a systematic and complete way was a\nphilosophical analysis of science in terms of activities. Operations\nprovide the philosopher (and the historian) of science with a very\nuseful unit of analysis: actions or events, as opposed to objects,\nstatements, beliefs, theories, paradigms, research programs, etc. The\nconcept of operation should provide an effective framework for\nincorporating certain highly valuable insights about the nature of\nscientific practice, including the ideas of Ludwig Wittgenstein (1953)\non language-games, Michael Polanyi (1958) on tacit knowledge, Marjorie\nGrene (1974) on the knowing agent, and Ian Hacking (1983) on direct\ninterventions in experimental investigations. \nIn order to develop Bridgman’s operational analysis into a\nfull-fledged philosophy of scientific practice, there are some aspects\nof his thought that we need to develop and articulate further. First\nof all, as noted in Section 2.3 above, we need a clearer and more\ndetailed taxonomy of operations, without trying to say which types are\nbetter or worse at the outset. From this point of view it should not\nbe regarded as a problem or an annoyance that there are different\ntypes of operations. The categories offered by Bridgman are much too\nbroad, so we need to identify and describe specific and concrete\noperations, and also distinguish simple and elementary ones from more\ncomplex ones. For example, the operation of length measurement with a\nmeter-stick would be analyzable into the instrumental operations of\nalignment and concatenation, the perceptual operation of judging\nspatial coincidence, and the mental operation of counting. The\noperation of hypothesis-testing (in the “received view”)\nwould be analyzable into the simpler operations of deductive\nprediction, experimental observation, and the comparison between\ndeduced and observed outcomes. In the understanding of these\noperations we would need a detailed account of the scientist as the\nagent who performs the operations; here we return to Bridgman’s\npreoccupation with the free individual, but also in essential social\ninteraction with other individuals. A full understanding of operations\nwould require an understanding of the agent’s purposes (partly\nbased on the fundamental aims of science), assumptions (including\nmetaphysical principles essential for the particular type of activity\nin question), and skills and capabilities (including the tacit\ndimension). If we can achieve such a thick description of the\noperations that constitute scientific practice, we would be able to\nmake good on Bridgman’s promise that “it is better,\nbecause it takes us further, to analyze into doings or happenings\nrather than into objects or entities.” \nAbove I presented a new operationalism as a promising framework for\nthe analysis of scientific practice. Do Bridgman’s ideas and\nattitudes also hold any current relevance for practicing \n scientists?[5]\nIt should have been clear from the discussion in Section 1 above that\nBridgman intended to reform scientific practice itself, not just its\nsecond-order analysis, so we must ask whether his reformist agenda has\nanything left in it for current science. To the casual reader, much of\nBridgman’s writing will seem like a series of radical complaints\nabout the meaninglessness of various concepts and statements. But he\nwas not interested in skeptical critique as an idle and indiscriminate\nphilosophical exercise. He got most worried when a concept was being\nextended to new situations where the familiar operations defining the\nconcept ceased to be applicable. His arguments often had an\niconoclastic flavor because he was exceptionally good at recognizing\nwhere a concept had been extended to new domains unthinkingly and most\npeople were not even aware that the extension had been made. From the\nmethodological lesson he took from Einstein to the insights gained in\nhis own high-pressure physics, an important focus of Bridgman’s\noperationalism was on regulating the extension of concepts to\nuncharted domains. \nBridgman reminded us forcefully that measurement operations did not\nhave unlimited domains of application, and that our conceptual\nstructures consequently had “joints” at which operational\nmeanings changed. But there can be no “joints” if there is\nno continuous tissue around the disjointed bones. Less metaphorically:\nif we reduce meaning entirely to measurement operations, there are no\npossible grounds for assuming or demanding any continuity of meaning\nwhere there is clear discontinuity in measurement operations. When we\nhave two different operations which give convergent results in the\noverlapping domain, how do we tell whether what we have is an\naccidental convergence of the measured values of two unrelated\nquantities, or a unified concept measured by two different methods?\nSome critics have maintained that only a recourse to theories can give\nus the answer (e.g., Lindsay 1937, 458; Gillies 1972, 23). That does\nnot seem to me always necessary, as theory is not the only source of\nsemantic continuity. There are instrumental operations that are not\nmetrological, and these operations can provide a continuity of meaning\nagainst which metrological validity can be judged (see Section 2.1).\nWe can take operationalism as a useful and practicable caution not to\nmake conceptual extensions without operational grounds. \nA homespun example from the 18th century illustrates this point\nnicely: the efforts of the English potter Josiah Wedgwood\n(1730–1795) to extend the temperature scale to cover the very\nhigh temperatures in his kilns, at which mercury vaporized and glass\nmelted. All previously known thermometers failed in that pyrometric\nrange, so Wedgwood felt obliged to invent a whole new measurement\nstandard (reminiscent of Bridgman in his high-pressure laboratory).\nWedgwood noticed that very high temperatures made pieces of clay\nshrink, and created a temperature scale by assuming that the amount of\ncontraction was proportional to temperature beyond “red\nheat”. As the start of his scale (red heat, defined as 0) was\nalready beyond the boiling point of mercury, Wedgwood’s scale\nwas wholly disconnected from the temperature scale defined by mercury\nthermometers. Later, in response to widespread demand to clarify the\nmeaning of his scale in more usual terms, Wedgwood made a translation\nof his scale into Fahrenheit degrees, by means of an intermediate\nstandard (thermal expansion of silver) which overlapped with the high\nend of the mercury scale and the low end of the clay scale. (This\nprocedure produced some unlikely numbers, for example 21,877°F for\nthe temperature of his air-furnace.) It seems that Wedgwood initially\ndid exactly what operationalist conscience would dictate: as the new\ninstrument did not operate at all in the range of any trustworthy\nprevious thermometers, he made a fresh scale. Why was that not the\nhonest thing to do, and quite sufficient, too? Why did everyone,\nincluding Wedgwood himself, feel compelled to interpret the Wedgwood\nclay scale in terms of the Fahrenheit mercury scale? Why was a\ncontinuous extension desired so strongly, when a disjointed set of\noperations seemed to serve all necessary practical purposes? \nThe urge for conceptual extension, in the Wedgwood case, was rooted in\na widespread feeling that there was a property in the\npyrometric range that was continuous in its meaning with temperature\nin the everyday range. Where did that feeling come from, long before\nthere was any well-defined and agreed-upon theoretical concept of\ntemperature? If we look closely at the situation, numerous subtle and\noften-unspoken connections do emerge between pyrometric temperature\nand everyday temperature. In the first place, we do bring objects to\npyrometric domains by prolonged heating—that is to say, by a\nprolonged application of ordinary processes that cause the rise of\ntemperature within the everyday domain. Likewise, the same causes of\ncooling that operate in the everyday domain will bring objects from\npyrometric temperatures down to everyday temperatures; that is\nprecisely what happens in calorimetric pyrometry (or, when we simply\nleave very hot things out in cold air for a while). These concrete\nphysical operations provide a continuity of operational meaning\nbetween two domains that are not connected by a common measurement\nstandard. Here again we need to articulate something that Bridgman\nalready did imply: not all instrumental operations are measurement\noperations (for instance, we may know how to make iron melt without\nthereby obtaining any precise idea of the temperature at which that\nhappens). Operational meaning even in the narrow, instrumental sense\nis broader than meaning specified by methods of measurement. \nThe connections listed above rest on very basic qualitative causal\nassumptions about temperature: fire raises the temperature of any\nordinary objects on which it acts directly; if two objects at\ndifferent temperatures are put in contact with each other, their\ntemperatures tend to approach each other. There are semi-quantitative\nlinks as well. It is taken for granted that the consumption of more\nfuel should result in the generation of more heat, and that is partly\nbased on a primitive notion of energy conservation. It is assumed that\nthe amount of heat communicated to an object is roughly proportional\nto the amount of change in its temperature (barring changes of state\nand interfering influences), and that assumption is based on the rough\nbut robust understanding of temperature as the “degree of\nheat.” So, for example, when a crucible is put on a steady fire,\none assumes that the temperature of its contents will rise steadily,\nup to a certain maximum. That is exactly the kind of reasoning used by\nthe chemist John Frederic Daniell (1790–1845) to criticize some\nof Wedgwood’s results: \nSimilar types of rough assumptions were also used in the extension of\ntemperature to very low temperatures (beyond the freezing point of\nmercury and alcohol). \nThese cases illustrate that concepts can and do get extended to fresh\nnew domains in which theories are uncertain and experience scant, even\nif no definite measurement operations have been worked out. We start\nwith a concept with a secure net of uses giving it stable meaning in a\nrestricted domain of circumstances. The extension of such a concept\nconsists in giving it a secure net of uses, also credibly linked to\nthe earlier net, in an adjacent domain. Such extension can happen in\nall kinds of ways, including theoretical fiat and metaphysical\npresumption, but the operational method is the most assured one.\nSpecific, well-defined operations, whether they be instrumental,\nmental or paper-and-pencil type, can start a secure skeleton of\nmeaning in the new domain. With all the elements of new meaning\noperationally well-defined, it also becomes possible to attempt\nlinking them up with each other at each step along the way and check\nthe whole meaning for coherence. (Compare such a deliberate process\nwith the vague presumption that terms in a theoretical equation must\nhave the same meaning in the entire mathematical range given to the\nvariables.) Operationalism in this guise can be used as a secure\nmethod of conceptual extension, quite the opposite of the kind of\nfragmentation that Hempel feared. Such operationalism would not\ndestroy systematic unity; on the contrary, it is an optimal strategy\nfor achieving as much systematic unity as nature would allow, in a\nstrongly empiricist system of knowledge. \nConceptual extension is important, especially since it served as one\nof the key initial motivations of Bridgman’s thought, but it is\nonly part of the operationalist story. In more general terms,\noperationalism can be seen as a strategy for increasing the empirical\ncontent of scientific theories. What is empirical content? Karl Popper\nsaw the amount of the empirical content of a theory as the number of\nstates of the world that are forbidden by it. Regarding laws of nature\nhe said: “the more they prohibit they more they say”\n(Popper 1972, 41). Or, somewhat more formally: “I define the\nempirical content of a statement p as the class of\nits potential falsifiers” (120). Similarly but staying away from\nthe strict falsificationist idiom, Imre Lakatos understood empirical\ncontent as the number of empirically testable predictions. Empirical\ncontent is not something we hear about very much these days in\nphilosophy of science after the receding of Popperian and Lakatosian\ndoctrines, but for Bridgman and many other operationalists it was one\nof the key issues. \nIf we take operationalism as a commitment to increase empirical\ncontent, Bridgman was not so much a high-handed judge who pronounced\nupon the meaningfulness of concepts in a black-and-white manner.\nRather, he offered operational analysis as a tool of self-diagnosis\nand self-improvement. He was interested in advancing science, not in\ncarping against it; like Descartes, he used skepticism as a means of\nachieving a more positive end. In this connection there is a point to\nBunge’s (1988, 341) contention that “operational\ndefinition” is a misnomer and we should instead speak of\n“indicator hypotheses” that offer links between\nunobservable properties and observable ones. In my view,\nBridgman’s enterprise can be understood quite well as an\ninstance of what goes by the name of “conceptual\nengineering” these days (see Cappelen 2018, and Brun 2016 for\nconnections with Carnapian explication). Concepts can be engineered to\nvarious ends, and in the case of operationalism the overriding concern\nis to make them as empirically meaningful as the circumstances\npermit. \nThe operationalist dictum could be phrased as follows: maintain and\nincrease the empirical content of theories by the use of operationally\nwell-defined concepts. It is difficult to craft an exact quantitative\nmeasure of empirical content, but we can at least say that the amount\nof empirical content depends on the number of empirically testable\nrelations that a theory specifies. That, in turn, depends on the\nnumber of independently measurable parameters. Increasing the number\nof independent parameters, or at least maintaining it, was something\nthat Bridgman sought to achieve with his operationalism. This, I\nsubmit, was one of the key reasons why he did not like conceptual\nextensions that were not backed up by measurement operations in the\nnew domain. And it seems to me that this lesson was taken to heart by\nthe operationist psychologists much more than the physicists, as Feest\n(2010; 2012) explains in her discussion of how operational definitions\nshould be understood as tools of experimental investigation. \nTo follow Bridgman’s thinking along these lines, consider this\nintriguing passage, which at first glance looks like another complaint\nabout meaninglessness. But towards the end the main point emerges as a\nworry about diminishing empirical content: \nSuch a reduction in the number of operationally meaningful concepts\nwill almost inevitably result in a corresponding reduction in the\nnumber of relations that can be tested empirically. A good scientist\nwould fight against such a prospect of diminished empirical\ncontent. \nThis concern with empirical content also explains why Bridgman was not\ncontent with the mainstream post-positivist philosophical discourse on\nconcept-formation and empirical significance, exemplified by the works\nof Carl Hempel and Willard Van Orman Quine. As noted in Section 2.2,\nBridgman did not object to theoretical science creating a system of\nconcepts and laws that made contact with observations only at some\npoints. However, Quinean holism, in which the unit of empirical\nsignificance was the entire system of knowledge, had no particular\nconcern about increasing the number of those points-of-contact with\nexperience. Bridgman’s ideal was to operationalize each and\nevery concept if possible, and each case of de-operationalization rang\nalarm bells in his head. \nRecognizing the importance of empirical content helps us make sense of\nBridgman’s complex attitude toward theoretical concepts. In a\nlittle-known section of The Logic of Modern Physics, he\ndiscussed what he called “mental constructs” in science,\nparticularly those created in order to “enable us to deal with\nphysical situations which we cannot directly experience through our\nsenses, but with which we have contact indirectly and by\ninference” (1927, 53–60). Not all constructs are the\nsame: \nThey were also very easily overlooked in the thinking of\nphilosophers who debated his ideas. What Bridgman says here\nis entirely contrary to the common image of his doctrines. When it\ncame to constructs, “of which physics is full,” Bridgman\nnot only admitted that one concept could correspond to many different\noperations, but even suggested that such multiplicity of operational\nmeaning was “what we mean by the reality of things not given\ndirectly by experience.” In an illustration of these ideas,\nBridgman argued that the concept of stress within a solid body had\nphysical reality, but the concept of electric field did not, since the\nlatter only ever manifested itself through force and electric charge,\nby which it was defined (Bridgman 1927, 57). This comes down to the\nstance that a theoretical concept without direct operational meaning\nis worthwhile only if it serves as a mediator connecting two or more\noperationally meaningful concepts, creating an empirically testable\nrelation. This is in fact not so different from Hempel’s view\nquoted in Section 2.2, albeit with a different emphasis. \nIn closing, I would like to pull out an insight from Bridgman that is\nusually not recognized in discussions of operationalism, but actually\nhas emerged as a significant point of contention in more recent\nphilosophy of science. This is the issue of complexity. In\nSection 1.1 I have already quoted Bridgman’s puzzling statement\nthat nature is ultimately “neither understandable nor subject to\nlaw.” As it turns out, that was not an isolated off-hand remark.\nAn important aspect of Bridgman’s operationalism was a search\nfor certainty, and it was a search made all the more desperate by a\ndeep-rooted pessimism about the possibility of attaining any certainty\nin science, at least if scientists were to seek a simple and unified\nsystem of knowledge. Bridgman professed his belief that “the\nexternal world of objects and happenings is … so complex that\nall aspects of it can never be reproduced by any verbal\nstructure.” He lamented: “Even in physics this is not\nsufficiently appreciated, as is shown, for example, by the reification\nof energy. The totality of situations covered by various aspects of\nthe energy concept is too complex to be reproduced by any simple\nverbal device.” (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 78) \nBridgman’s view on the complexity of nature also had a direct\nimplication for the limits of operational analysis itself in providing\nclarity and precision. Right from The Logic of Modern\nPhysics, Bridgman stressed that “all results of measurement\nare only approximate”; this obvious fact, he said,\n“tacitly underlies all our discussion”. This he attributed\nultimately to something fundamental about the nature of human\nexperience: “all experience seems to be of this character; we\nnever have perfectly clean-cut knowledge of anything, but all our\nexperience is surrounded by a twilight zone, a penumbra of\nuncertainty, into which we have not yet penetrated. This penumbra is\nas truly an unexplored region as any other region beyond\nexperiment” (1927, 33). This indicated a fundamental limitation\nto the certainty of operations: “Operations themselves are, of\ncourse, derived from experience, and would be expected also to have a\nnebulous edge of uncertainty” (1927, 36). Bridgman remained\nclearly aware of the complexities revealed by operational analysis,\nstating late in his life that “operational analysis can always\nbe pushed to the point where sharpness disappears” (Bridgman in\nFrank 1956, 78), and that “there is nothing absolute or final\nabout an operational analysis” (Bridgman 1959b, 522). Still, he\nwould not give up on the pushing, which was necessary to reach as much\nclarity as possible. \nBridgman’s battle against his own skeptical and pessimistic\nconscience was a heroic one. After decades of operationalist thinking\nhe arrived at “a picture of man isolated … in an oasis of\nphenomena which he will never be able to transcend because beyond its\nbounds the operations are impossible which are necessary to give\nmeaning to his thought” (Bridgman 1955, 540). What this picture\nforced on him was a deep sense of humility, as expressed in his\nmemorable statement on the scientific method: “The scientific\nmethod, as far as it is a method, is nothing more than doing\none’s damnedest with one’s mind, no holds barred”\n(1955, 535). Retaining that sense of humility will help us in\ndeveloping Bridgman’s unfinished thoughts to create a new\noperationalism that does full justice to the complexity and richness\nof both nature and human scientific practice.","contact.mail":"hc372@cam.ac.uk","contact.domain":"cam.ac.uk"}]
