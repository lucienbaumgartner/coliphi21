Individuals who apparently have access to\nthe same information and are equally interested in the truth do in\nfact affirm incompatible perspectives on, for instance, significant\nsocial, political, and economic issues. Such diversity of opinion,\nthough, is nowhere more evident than in the area of religious thought.\nOn almost every religious issue there are honest, knowledgeable people\nwho hold significantly diverse, often incompatible beliefs. \n\n\nReligious diversity of this sort can fruitfully be explored in many\nways —for instance, from psychological, anthropological, or\nhistorical perspectives. The current discussion, however, will concern\nitself primarily with those key issues surrounding religious diversity\nwith which philosophers, especially analytic philosophers of religion,\nare most concerned at present. Specifically, our discussion will focus\nprimarily on the following questions: How pervasive is religious\ndiversity? Does the reality of this diversity require a response? Can\na person who acknowledges religious diversity remain justified in\nclaiming just one perspective to be correct? If so, is it morally\njustifiable to attempt to convert others to a different perspective?\nCan it justifiably be claimed that only one religion offers a path\ninto the eternal presence of God? How should religious diversity be\napproached in public education? The answers to such questions are not\nsimply academic; they have practical implications. They increasingly\nhave great impact on how we treat others, both personally and\ncorporately.\n\n\nThe main goal of this discussion, it is important to note, is not to\nsupport a given perspective on these issues. It is to clarify the\nissues and explore differing perspectives.\n\nMost religions are theistic in the sense that they posit the existence\nof a personal Supreme Being (God) or set of personal deities, although\nwithin some belief systems normally labeled religions—for\nexample, Buddhism—there is no belief in such a being.\nMonotheistic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam agree\nthat there is a sole God. Polytheistic religions such as Taoism,\nJapanese Shinto, and Chinese folk religion hold that there are\nmultiple deities (gods). While Hinduism typically recognizes many gods\nand goddesses, it is not polytheistic. Those varieties of Hinduism\nthat count these many deities as aspects of a single God can be\nconsidered monotheistic. Other strands of Hinduism are henotheistic,\nworshiping one deity but recognizing many others. While much of what\nfollows is applicable to any theistic religion, the focus will be on\nthe diversity issues that arise predominately in those religions that\nbelieve in a sole personal Supreme Being (God). \nWhile there is obviously widespread diversity of thought among these\nmonotheistic religions (theistic systems) on such issues as the\nGod’s nature and character, the relationship between divine control\nand human freedom, the extent to which God unilaterally intervenes in\nour world, and how God would have us live, it is being increasingly\nrecognized that widespread diversity of thought on all these issues\nalso exists just as clearly, and in exactly the same sense, within\nbasic theistic systems. For example, within Christianity, believers\ndiffer significantly on the nature of God. Some see God as\nall-controlling, others as self-limiting, and still others as\nincapable of unilaterally controlling any aspect of reality. Some\nbelieve God to have infallible knowledge only of all that has occurred\nor is occurring, others claim God also has knowledge of all that will\nactually occur, while those who believe God possesses middle knowledge\nadd that God knows all that would actually occur in any possible\ncontext. Some believe the moral principles stipulated by God for\ncorrect human behavior flow from God’s nature or character and thus\nthat such principles determine God’s behavior, while others believe\nthat God acts in accordance with a different set of moral rules than\nthose moral rules given to humans; that for God what is right is\nsimply whatever God does. Some believe that only those who have\nconsciously “given their lives to Christ” will spend eternity in\nGod’s presence. Others believe that many who have never even heard\nthe name of Jesus will enter God’s presence, while others yet do not\neven believe subjective immortality (a conscious afterlife) to be a\nreality. Muslims also differ significantly among themselves on these\nsame divine attributes (Aijaz 2015). Consider, for example, the wide\nvariety of Muslim perspectives on such issues as the autonomy of the\nindividual when interpreting the Qur’an, how best to apply core\nIslamic values to modern life, and the status of women. We find\nequally pervasive, significant intra-system diversity in Hinduism\n(Sharma 2011) and Judaism (Shatz 2011). \nMoreover, there is also an increasing awareness that the practical\nimport of intra-theistic diversity is just as significant as is that\nof inter-theistic diversity. For most Christians, for instance, the\npractical significance of retaining or modifying beliefs about God’s\npower or knowledge is just as great as retaining or modifying the\nbelief that Christianity is a better theistic explanatory hypothesis\nthan Islam. In fact, as Dennis Potter points out, whether there are\nactually differing inter-theistic perspectives on a given issues often\ndepends on which intra-theistic perspectives we are considering\n(Potter 2013). So both types of diversity will be given equal\nattention in our discussion \nOne obvious response to religious diversity of any form is to maintain\nthat since there exists no divine reality—since the referent in\nall religious truth claims related to the divine is\nnonexistent—all such claims should be considered false. Another\npossible response, sometimes put forth by religious relativists, is\nthat there is no singular truth when considering mutually incompatible\nreligious claims about reality; more than one of the conflicting sets\nof specific truth-claims can be correct concurrently (Runzo 1988,\n351–357). However, most current discussions of religious\ndiversity presuppose a realist theory of truth—that there is a\ntruth to the matter. \nUnfortunately there is no standard way to categorize responses to the\ndiversity of perspectives on religious truth claims. Religious\nexclusivism and religious pluralism appear in most categorizations,\nbut not always with the same meanings. Religious inclusivism also\nsometime appears, but primarily in discussions about sufficient\nconditions for spending eternity with God, as it does in the\ndiscussion below (section 8) on the Eternal Destiny of Humankind.\nAccordingly, our general discussion of religious truth claims will\nfocus on three basic categories: religious exclusivism, religious\nnon-exclusivism, and religious pluralism. For our purposes,\nindividuals are religious exclusivists when they believe that their\nperspective on some disputed inter-theistic truth claim—for\nexample, that Allah is the true God—or some disputed\nintra-theistic truth claim—for example, that the Christian God\ncannot control free human choice—to be the truth or at least\ncloser to the truth than any other competing religious perspective on\nthis\n issue.[1]\n Individuals are religious non-exclusivists with respect to a disputed\nreligious truth claim when they deny that any given religious\nperspective on this claim is superior to all other competing religious\nperspectives on this issue. Finally, individuals are religious\npluralists with respect to a given inter-theistic or intra-theistic\ntruth claim when they maintain not only (as non-exclusivists) that no\nsingle religious perspective is superior to all others but also make a\npositive claim about the truth of the matter. The nature of this claim\ndepends on the type of issue in question. If the issue is one on which\nit is possible that the perspectives of more than one religion or\nvariant thereof could be true—for example, the sufficient\nconditions for spending eternity in God’s presence—pluralists\nclaim that the religious perspectives of more than one basic theistic\nsystem or variant thereof can justifiably be considered equally close\nto the truth (Marbaniang 2010). If the issue is one on which there can\nbe only one actual truth to the matter, but we have no objective means\nof determining exactly what that truth is—for example, the\nactual nature of God—pluralists claim that the perspectives of\nmore than one basic theistic system or variant thereof can justifiably\nbe considered to reflect some aspect of this truth (Byrne 2011,\n 36–7).[2] \nNo philosopher denies that the awareness (realization) of seeming\nreligious diversity sometimes does in fact have an impact on\nexclusivists—from causing minor uneasiness to significantly\nreducing their level of confidence in the truth of certain beliefs to\nprecipitating belief abandonment. This is simply an empirical claim\nabout psychological states and behaviors (Alston 1988, 442–446;\nPlantinga 2000, 189). \nHow should, though, exclusivists coming to an awareness of religious\ndiversity—the awareness that seemingly sincere, knowledgeable\nindividuals differ with them on an issue of religious\nsignificance—respond to the reality of such diversity? How\nshould, for instance, the devout Hindu or Christian who comes to\nrealize that others who seem as knowledgeable and devout hold\nincompatible religious perspectives respond? Or how should Christians\nwho believe the Bible clearly portrays a God with total control over\nall aspects of reality respond to the realization that other seemingly\nsincere, devout, “Bible-believing” Christians see the Bible as\nclearly portraying a God who has chosen not to control what occurs in\nthose contexts in which humans have been granted meaningful moral\nfreedom? Can exclusivists justifiably disregard such diversity? If\nnot, are exclusivists under some obligation to attempt to resolve such\nepistemic conflicts—engage in belief assessment (or\nreassessment) with openness to possible revision? Or would it at least\nbe a good idea to do so? \nWithin the relevant “epistemology of disagreement\nliterature,” we find significantly different responses. There\nare, of course, religious individuals (and groups) who believe it is\ninappropriate to subject religious beliefs to assessment of any sort.\nCertain individuals (sometimes called fideists) have argued, for\ninstance, that religious beliefs are not of a type properly subjected\nto rational assessment and/or that assessing such beliefs demonstrates\na lack of faith (Peterson et al. 2013, 65–69). But few\nphilosophers currently hold this position. Most maintain that\nexclusivists have at least the right to assess their beliefs in the\nface of religious diversity. \nThere continues, however, to be significant debate on whether\nexclusivists are under an obligation to engage in such belief\nassessment. Some philosophers agree with Robert McKim that\n“disagreement about an issue or area of inquiry provides reason to\nthink that each side has an obligation to examine beliefs about the\nissue” (McKim 2001, 140). The underlying assumption here is that\nwhen perspectives on any issue, be they personal, social, economic,\npolitical, or religious, have important consequences for that person\nor others, then individuals are under an obligation to find the truth\nof the matter—to maximize truth. Individuals, in this case\nreligious exclusivists, can only attempt to maximize truth or avoid\nerror in the face of diverse claims, it is argued, if they attempt to\nresolve the conflict. \nThe contention here, it must be emphasized, is not that such\nresolution is always possible or that exclusivists must necessarily\ngive up their belief if no resolution is forthcoming. Discussion\nconcerning those issues is yet to come. The claim, rather, is only\nthat the exclusivist is obligated at the very least to assess the\nevidence for and against the beliefs in question and to try to\n“get a sense of the appeal and of the concern of those who\nadvocate them” (McKim 2001, 146). \nOthers philosophers disagree. For example, Alvin Plantinga\nacknowledges that if proponents of a specific religious perspective\nhave no reason to doubt that those with whom they disagree really are\non equal epistemic footing, then they are under a prima facie\nobligation to attempt to resolve the conflict. However, Plantinga\ndenies that Christian exclusivists need ever acknowledge that they are\nfacing true epistemic parity—need ever admit that they actually\nare differing with true epistemic peers. Although Christian\nexclusivists, we are told, may grant that those with whom they are in\ndisagreement have not violated any epistemic duty and may know of no\narguments that would convince others of their wrongness while\nmaintaining their rightness, exclusivists are likely to believe that\nthey “have been epistemically favored in some way.” They might\nbelieve, for instance, that they have been graced by ‘the Internal\nWitness of the Holy Spirit’; or \nMoreover, if any beliefs of this type are true, Plantinga contends,\nthen Christian exclusivists are quite probably “in a better\nposition, epistemically speaking,” than those who reject the\nexclusivistic belief in question. Therefore, since it cannot be\ndemonstrated that Christian belief of this sort is very likely false,\nChristian believers remain justified in maintaining that the\nproponents of other religious perspectives are not actually on an\nequal epistemic footing. The same, Plantinga acknowledges, might well\nbe true for exclusivists in other religious belief systems (Plantinga\n1997, 296).\n [3] \nThe strength of this line of reasoning depends in part on the\ndebatable issue of who shoulders the burden of proof on the question\nof equal epistemic footing. Those siding with Plantinga argue in\nessence that unless exclusivists must acknowledge on epistemic grounds\nthat are (or should be) accepted by all rational people that those\nholding incompatible beliefs are actually on equal footing,\nexclusivists can justifiably deny that this is so and thus need not\nengage in belief assessment (Kim 2011). Those supporting obligatory\nbelief assessment argue that exclusivists are the ones who shoulder\nthe burden of proof. Unless it can be demonstrated on epistemic\ngrounds that are (or should be) accepted by all rational people that\nproponents of the competing perspectives are not actually on equal\nepistemic footing, exclusivists must consider their challengers on\nequal epistemic footing and are thus obligated to engage in belief\nassessment (Basinger 2002, 26–27). Or, to state this important\ndistinction another way, it is Plantinga’s contention that we need\nnot acknowledge that those with whom we disagree are actually on equal\nepistemic footing unless it can be demonstrated objectively that they\nare equally knowledgeable and sincere, while his critics maintain that\nwe must acknowledge that those with whom we disagree are on equal\nepistemic footing unless we have an objective means of demonstrating\nthat we are in fact more knowledgeable and/or sincere than they. Most\nphilosophers of religion side with the critics in this case and thus\nassume that actual peer conflict cannot be denied (Byrne 2011,\n30). \nAnother influential type of challenge to obligatory belief assessment\nin the face of religious diversity has been raised by Jerome Gellman.\nThe focus of his challenge centers on what he identifies as rock\nbottom beliefs. Such beliefs, as Gellman defines them, are the\nepistemic givens in a religious belief system—the assumed,\nfoundational truths upon which all else is built. Gellman grants that\nif a religious belief affirmed by an exclusivist is not rock bottom\n(is not a foundational assumption), then it may well be subject to\nobligatory belief assessment in the face of religious diversity.\nHowever, he argues, since belief assessment only makes sense when one\nisn’t certain that the belief in question is true, and since rock\nbottom religious beliefs are among the foundational truths—the\nbasic, assumed truths—in an exclusivist’s epistemic system, no\nassessment is necessary. Rather, when exclusivists encounter a\nchallenge to such a belief—for example, a challenge to their\nrock bottom belief in God’s ultimate control over all earthly\naffairs—they can, utilizing the G. E. Moore switch, justifiably\nmaintain that because their rock bottom belief is true, the competing\nbelief can justifiably be rejected (Gellman 1993, 345–364;\nGellman 1998, 229–235). \nFurthermore, Gellman has added, even if we grant that rock bottom\nbeliefs are at times open to belief assessment, exclusivists need not\nengage in such assessment in the face of religious diversity unless\nthey find that the awareness of such diversity is causing them to lose\nsignificant confidence in their own perspective. In the absence of\nthis type of internal conflict, they “may rationally invoke [their]\nunreflective religious belief to defeat opposing religious claims,\nwithout having to consider the question any further” (Gellman 2000,\n403). \nIt would seem, though, that even those who are sympathetic to\nGellman’s general line of reasoning would want to limit its scope.\nMany religious beliefs held by exclusivists have practical\nconsequences. That is, exclusivist beliefs are not isolated cognitive\nassumptions; they motivate behavior. For instance, there are many\ntheists worldwide who not only still believe that men have some sort\nof God-given, inherent authority over women, or that certain ethnic\ngroups have God-given superiority, or that certain sexual orientations\nare perversions of God’s ideal, or that humans have God-given\nauthority over the rest of nature, or that God desires heretics to be\nsilenced, they also act on these beliefs. However, it seems safe to\nassume that most exclusivists, including Gellman, believe that some of\nthese actions are morally wrong and ought to be stopped to the extent\npossible. In such cases, it is difficult to imagine many exclusivists\nmaintaining that those who hold the beliefs on which these acts are\nbased have no need to reassess these beliefs unless they personally\nfeel a need to do so. It seems, rather, that most exclusivists would\nwant those holding such beliefs to at the very least engage in\nsignificant belief reassessment, even if they don’t at present\npersonally feel a need to do so. \nSome philosophers/theologians assume that belief assessment, when\nconducted properly, can often resolve epistemic peer conflict (Byrne\n2011, 31; Aijaz 2017). But what if we assume that while the\nconsideration of criteria such as self-consistency and\ncomprehensiveness can rule out certain options, there exists no set of\ncriteria that will allow us to resolve most religious epistemic\ndisputes (either between or within religious perspectives) in a\nneutral, nonquestion-begging fashion (Peterson et al. 2013,\n69–74)? In what epistemic position does this then place the\nexclusivist? Or to use the phrasing preferred in the current\n“epistemology of disagreement” debates, to what extent, if\nany, is it reasonable for exclusivists to retain their exclusivistic\nbeliefs when it is acknowledged that epistemic peers\n disagree?[4] \nThe answer, as some see it, is that exclusivists can no longer\njustifiably maintain that their exclusivistic beliefs are true. J.L.\nSchellenberg, for example, argues that because no more than one among\na set of incompatible truth claims can be true, disputants in a debate\nover such claims are justified in continuing to maintain that their\nclaim is true only if they possess nonquestion-begging justification\n— justification based on assumptions and lines of reasoning\nacceptable to both parties — for believing the incompatible\nclaim of any competitor to be false. However, since disputants in no\nreligious conflicts possess such justification, disputants cannot be\njustified “in holding their own claim to be true.” Or, As\nSchellenberg states this conclusion in another context, we must\nconclude that in the absence of objective, nonquestion-begging\njustification, none of the disputants in religious conflicts “has\njustification for supposing the others’ claims false”\n(Schellenberg 2000, 213). David Silver comes to a similar conclusion:\n“[Exclusivists] should provide independent evidence for the claim\nthat they have a special source of religious knowledge ... or they\nshould relinquish their exclusivist religious beliefs” (Silver 2001,\n11). \nIn more recent discussions, this perspective is sometimes labeled\n“(strong) Conciliationism” (Christensen 2007, 2016; Feldman\n2006) or the “Equal Weight View” (Cohen 2013). When exclusivists\nand their epistemic peers disagree and exclusivists can offer no\nindependent reasons that establish their position, then exclusivists\nshould acknowledge that their perspective has no greater epistemic\nweight than those of their epistemic competitors and either suspend\njudgment or abandon their exclusivistic position and grant equal\nepistemic status to all the self-consistent, comprehensive\nperspectives in play. \nOthers have not gone this far, arguing rather that while exclusivists\nneed not abandon religious belief in the face of unresolved conflict,\nthey must, or at least be willing to, hold their exclusive religious\nbeliefs more tentatively (with less confidence). Philip Quinn argues,\nfor instance, that acknowledged epistemic parity necessarily has a\nnegative (epistemically humbling) impact on the level of justification\nfor any religious belief system. Such parity does not necessarily\nreduce justification below a level sufficient for rational\nacceptability. But for those proponents of a religion who are\n“sufficiently aware of religious diversity, the justification that\nthe [religion] receives from its sources is a good deal less than\nwould be the case were there no such diversity” (Quinn 2005a, 137).\nJames Kraft agrees, arguing that when individuals acknowledge that\nthose with whom they disagree are equivalently informed and capable\nand have made no obvious mistakes in reasoning, their confidence in\ntheir perspective is rightly reduced (Kraft 2007) \nThe tentativeness this reduction in confidence produces, McKim tells\nus, does not entail never-ending inquiry. What it means, rather, is\nthat in the face of unresolved religious diversity, a person should be\nopen to the possibility “that one or more of the [alternatives]\nmay be correct … that the position one had thought to be\ncorrect may be wrong [while] one of the other positions may be\nright” (McKim 2001, 154–55). Joseph Runzo and Gary Gutting\nagree. According to Runzo, “all faith commitments must be held\nwith the humbling recognition that they can be misguided, for our\nknowledge is never sure” (Runzo 1993, 236). Gutting argues that\nonly interim, not decisive assent is justified in the face of\nunresolved diversity and that “those who give merely interim\nassent must recognize the equal value, as an essential element in the\ncontinuing discussion, of beliefs contrary to theirs” (Gutting\n1982, 108). Moreover, argues McKim, such tentativeness in the face of\ndiversity has an important payoff. It can lead to deep tolerance: the\nallowance “that those with whom you disagree are people whom it\nis worthwhile to approach with rational arguments” (McKim 2001,\n178) And personal tolerance of this sort, we are told, may well lead\nto a more tolerant and open society that will permit and even\nencourage a diversity of opinion on all issues, including opinions on\nreligious matters. [Whether this is in fact the case will be\nconsidered in detail in Section 6.] \nWilliam Alston represents an even more charitable response to\nexclusivism. His perspective is based on what he sees as a crucial\ndistinction between two types of epistemic disputes: those in which\n“it is clear what would constitute non-circular grounds for\nsupposing one of the contestants to be superior to the others”\nand those in which it is not. In the former case—in those cases\nin which there is a commonly accepted “procedure for settling\ndisputes”—it isn’t clear, he acknowledges, that it\nis rational for individuals to continue to maintain that their\nposition is superior (Alston 1988, 442–443). \nHowever, as Alston sees it, there exists no such common ground for\nsettling basic epistemic disputes over religious truth claims, and\nthis, he contends, alters the situation drastically. It still remains\ntrue, he grants, that the reality of religious diversity diminishes\njustification. But the fact that “we are at a loss to specify\n[common ground]” means, he argues, that with respect to those\nreligious perspectives that are self-consistent, it is not\n“irrational for one to remain an exclusivist”—not\nirrational for proponents of any religious perspective to continue to\nhold that their perspective is true. That is, as Alston sees it, given\nthe absence of common ground for resolving disputes, the proponent of\nany self-consistent religious perspective can justifiably continue to\nbelieve this perspective to be true “despite not being able to\nshow that it is epistemically superior to the competition”\n(Alston 1988, 443–446). Stated differently yet, Alston grants\nthat objective evidence is necessary for justified belief when the\ndebated issue is one for which such evidence is available. But when\nobjective evidence is not available—as is the case for most\nimportant religious contentions—it cannot be required for\njustified belief. \nIn fact, at one point he goes even further. Because there exists at\npresent no neutral ground for adjudicating religious epistemic\nconflicts, it is not only the case, Alston argues, that exclusivists\nare justified (rational) in continuing to consider their own\nperspective superior. Since we do not even know in most cases what a\nnon-circular reason for demonstrating superiority would look like, the\n“only rational course” for exclusivists “is to sit\ntight” with the beliefs “which [have] served so well in\nguiding [their] activity in the world.” Or, to generalize this\npoint, Alston speaks for those who maintain that, given the absence of\ncommon ground for adjudicating disputes concerning self-consistent\nreligious perspectives, it is not rational for exclusivists to stop\nmaintaining that their system is superior (Alston 1988,\n 444).[5] \nPhilip Quinn represents yet another, increasingly popular approach.\nWhile he agrees with Alston that in the face of diversity exclusivists\nmay well be justified in continuing to “sit\ntight”—in continuing to maintain that their religious\nperspective is true—he denies that this is the only rational\ncourse of action available (Quinn 2000, 235–246). The basis for\nthis position is his distinction between a pre-Kantian and a Kantian\nunderstanding of religious belief. To have a pre-Kantian understanding\nof religious belief is to assume that we have (or at least can have)\naccess to the truth as it really is. It is to believe, for instance,\nthat we do (or at least can in principle) know what God is really\nlike. To have a Kantian understanding of religious belief is to assume\nthat although there is a literal noumenal reality, our understanding\nof this reality (and thus our truth claims about this reality) will of\nnecessity be relative to the cultural/social/psychological lenses\nthrough which our conceptualization of this noumenal reality is\nprocessed. It is to believe, for instance, that although there is a\ndivine reality about which we can make truth claims, our understanding\nof (and thus our truth claims about) this divine reality will\nnecessarily to some extent be conditioned by the ways in which our\nenvironment (our culture in the broadest sense) has shaped our\ncategories of thought (Quinn 2000, 241–242). \nAlston, Quinn contends, is essentially working off of a pre-Kantian\nmodel of religious belief when he encourages religious exclusivists to\nsit tight in the face of peer conflict since, in the absence of any\nobjective basis for determining which perspective is right, the\nexclusivist has no sufficient reason not to do so. Quinn does not deny\nthat this pre-Kantian approach is justifiable and thus does not deny\nthat someone who follows Alston’s advice to sit tight is\nrational in doing so. However, Quinn believes that “it should\nnot be taken for granted that any of the [contending perspectives] in\nits present form is correct.” Hence, he believes it is equally\njustifiable for an exclusivist to adopt a Kantian approach to\nreligious belief. Specifically, he believes it is equally justifiable\nfor an exclusivist to assume that whatever any of us can know about\nthe truth of the matter will never be a description of religious\nreality that is free of significant cultural/social/psychological\nconditioning. Accordingly, it is also rational, he maintains, for\nexclusivists encountering diverse truth claims to “seek a more\ninclusivist or pluralistic understanding of their own faith” by\nmodifying their beliefs to bring them “into line with such an\nunderstanding” (Quinn 2000, 242). \nIn short, as Quinn sees it, those who hold a position such as\nAlston’s have left us, at least implicitly, with a false\ndilemma: either we find common ground on which we can objectively\ndetermine which religious perspective is the truth or we sit tight\nwith what we have. However, Quinn holds that, once we realize it is\nperfectly reasonable for a person to assume that the proponent of no\nreligious perspective has (or even could have) an accurate\nunderstanding of divine reality as it really is, another rational\nalternative appears. We then see that it is also perfectly rational\nfor people to begin to revise their own phenomenological perspective\non the truth in a way that will allow for greater overlap with the\nphenomenological perspectives of others. \nThe approach to conflicting religious perspectives Quinn outlines has\nin fact become increasingly popular in exclusivistic circles.\nConsider, for example, the ongoing debate among Christians over how\nGod brought the rest of reality into existence. Some still claim the\nBible clearly teaches that God created the “heavens and the\nearth” in six twenty-four hour periods about ten thousand years\nago. Others still maintain that the fact that “a day is to the\nLord as a thousand years” (Psalms 90:4) means that while God is\ndirectly responsible for what the Bible says was created each\n“day,” it is most reasonable to believe that the time\nframe for each instance of creative activity could well have been\nmillions, or even billions, of years. And then there are those who\nstill hold that God’s direct creative activity consisted\nprimarily of orchestrating the “Big Bang.” However, more\nrecently, many Christians have taken a more Kantian approach. Based on\ntheir assumption that we may well not have access, even through\nScripture, to exactly how God was involved in the creative process,\nthey have modified what is to be considered essential to Christianity\non this issue. Rather than affirming any of the specific explanations\nof how God created all else, they affirm a more general contention\ncompatible with each of these specific explanations: that God is in\nsome manner directly responsible for the existence of all else. They\nhave, in Quinn’s terms, thinned their core theologies in a way\nthat reconciles the divergent perspectives. [We will see in sections\nbelow that this emphasis on working toward common belief is sometimes\ncited as a way to minimize differing perspectives on the eternal\ndestiny of humans (Section 7) and to approach diversity of thought on\ncontroversial issues in education (Section 8).] \nEveryone realizes, though, that moving toward a thinner theology can\nresolve the epistemic tension produced by religious diversity only to\na certain extent. Let’s assume that it is perfectly reasonable, and\npossibly even preferable, for exclusivists to thin their theologies in\nan attempt to minimize that core of truths that must be accepted to\nremain proponents of the specific theological perspectives in\nquestion, to be an exclusivist—even a strongly Kantian\nexclusivist—is still to believe that one’s religious\nperspectives on some religious beliefs are superior in the sense that\nthey are in some important way closer to the truth than are the\ncompeting perspectives of others. Accordingly, while thinning their\ntheology may be a rational choice that can minimize conflict for\nexclusivists, no one is arguing that a certain amount of epistemic\nconflict will not remain. \nFinally, we find at the far end of the spectrum those who deny that\nacknowledged peer conflict does in fact require exclusivists to\nabandon their exclusivism or even reduce confidence in their\nexclusivistic perspectives. The key to this position is a distinction\nbetween personal (private) evidence and public evidence (evidence\navailable to all persons involved in the dispute). It is granted that\nindividuals will often find themselves in epistemic disputes with\npersons who are epistemic peers in the sense that they are (1) equally\nintelligent, thoughtful, and free from obvious bias and (2) equally\nfamiliar with all the relevant public evidence. But it is normally\nacknowledged that the final judgments made by participants in such\ndisputes are not made solely on this public evidence. Such judgments\nare based also on personal beliefs to which only each participant has\naccess. Jennifer Lackey notes, for instance, that individuals in an\nepistemic dispute have greater access to the reliability of their own\nbelief-forming faculties than do their epistemic competitors (Lackey\n2010). Ernest Sosa talks of a gulf between the private and public\ndomains (Sosa 2010). Peter van Inwagen speaks of “incommunicable\ninsight that the others, for all their merits, lack” (van Inwagen\n1996). And the weight of this private evidence, it is argued, can make\nit reasonable for individuals to retain their beliefs (including\nexclusivistic religious beliefs) with the same level of confidence,\neven in the face of acknowledged peer disagreement in the public\nsense. \nSome critics, of course, will maintain that this is primarily a verbal\nvictory. The question, remember, is whether exclusivists who\nacknowledges that epistemic peers hold incompatible perspectives can\ncontinue to justifiably maintain with full confidence that their\nperspective is superior. And it will seem to some that to claim that\nparticipants in epistemic disputes have access to relevant personal\nevidence not available to their epistemic competitors is in fact\nsimply to acknowledge that the dispute is really not among true\nepistemic peers in the sense originally intended—that is, in the\nsense that all parties are assessing the same body of evidence. \nLet us assume that exclusivists are justified in retaining their\nexclusivistic belief in the face of religious diversity. Ought they\nstop there or can they justifiably go further? Can they justifiably\ntry to convince others of their rightness—can they justifiably\ntry to convert others to their perspective? And if so, are they in any\nsense obligated to do so? \nMost who believe that such proselytization is not justified challenge\nthe moral character of exclusivists who attempts to convince those\nwith whom they differ to accept their perspective as the sole truth.\nFor instance, Wilfred Cantwell Smith argues that “except at the\ncost of insensitivity or delinquency, it is morally not possible\nactually to go out into the world and say to devout, intelligent\nfellow human beings [that] we believe that we know God and we are\nright; you believe that you know God, and you are totally wrong”\n(Smith 1976, 14). And when Runzo claims that exclusivism can be\n“highly presumptive” and “morally repugnant”\n(Runzo 1988, 348) or John Hick maintains that exclusivists often\nmanifest a sort of arbitrariness or arrogance (Hick 1989, 235), they\ntoo appear to be challenging the moral character of those who attempt\nto convert others to their perspective. \nNot surprisingly, most exclusivists deny that it is insensitive or\narrogant or presumptive for exclusivists to attempt to convince others\nthat the exclusivistic perspective is alone the correct one. Since we\nare justified in believing our position to be superior to\nothers—closer to the truth—it is difficult to see,\nexclusivists argue, how our attempts to convince others that they\nshould agree can be considered arrogant or presumptive or insensitive,\nespecially if we believe that it is important for the welfare of those\nwe are attempting to convert that they do so. Moreover, exclusivists\ncontinue, while it is surely true that some conversion is attempted\nfor what we would all agree are morally inappropriate\nreasons—for instance, for financial gain or to gain power over\nothers—there is little empirical evidence that exclusivists in\ngeneral have these motives. It is probably true, rather, that many, if\nnot most, exclusivists who proselytize do so primarily because they\nbelieve they have what others need and are willing (sometimes at great\npersonal cost) to share it with them. \nAre, though, exclusivists required to proselytize? Many exclusivistic\nreligious systems do require proselytization, and most philosophers\nwho believe that exclusivists are justified in retaining their\nexclusivistic beliefs in the face of religious diversity believe also\nthat these exclusivists can justifiably feel obligated to attempt to\n“convert” their epistemic competitors. With very few\nexceptions, though, philosophers deny that exclusivists are under any\ngeneral obligation to proselytize, regardless of whether the\nexclusivistic system in question demands or encourages such\n proselytization.[6] \nReligious intolerance, defined as the practice of keeping others from\nacting in accordance with their religious beliefs, is not new.\nHowever, there is concern world-wide over the increasing amount, and\nincreasingly violent nature, of such behavior. Accordingly, there is\nunderstandably a renewed interest in fostering religiously tolerant\nenvironments in which individuals with differing religious\nperspectives can practice their faiths unencumbered. \nA number of philosophers have turned their attention to the\nrelationship between religious diversity and religious tolerance, with\nthe main focus on whether acknowledgement of, and subsequent\nreflection on, religious diversity might lead to greater religious\ntolerance. The main argument supporting the claim that acknowledged\ndiversity can foster tolerance was proposed by Philip Quinn (Quinn\n2001, 57–80; 2002, 533–537; 2005a, 136–139). He\nmaintained that (1) serious reflection on the undeniable reality of\nreligious diversity will necessarily weaken people’s\njustification for believing that their religious perspective is\nsuperior to the perspectives of others and that (2) this weakened\njustification can, and hopefully will for some, lead to greater\nreligious tolerance—for example, will lead to a more accepting,\nless confrontational attitude toward others. \nBoth of Quinn’s contentions have been challenged. The claim that\nreflection on the acknowledged reality of religious diversity reduces\nindividuals’ justified confidence in the superiority of their\nposition has been subject to at least two types of criticism. As noted\nearlier in our discussion of religious diversity and epistemic\nobligation (section 3), some philosophers agree with Alvin Plantinga\nthat the proponents of a given religious perspective need not grant\nthat their competitors are actually on an equal epistemic footing and\nare thus justified in continuing to maintain that their perspective is\nsuperior without further reflection (Plantinga 1997, 296).  \nOther philosophers do not deny that proponents of differing religious\nperspectives are on an equal epistemic footing or that reflection on\nthese diverse perspectives might in some cases actually cause\nindividuals to become less certain that their perspective is superior.\nThey do deny, however, that there is any necessary epistemic\nconnection between acknowledged diversity and a weakening of justified\npersonal commitment. That is, they argue, proponents of a given\nreligious perspective can acknowledge both that (1) those holding\nperspectives differing from their own are epistemic peers and that (2)\nthey are not in a position to demonstrate objectively that their\nposition is superior and yet can justifiably continue to maintain that\n(3) their perspective is, in fact, superior (Hasker 2008). \nQuinn’s second contention—that weakened justification in the\nsuperiority of a perspective has the promising potential for fostering\nreligious tolerance—has also been challenged. For instance,\nWilliam Lane Craig, Robert McKim, and Keith Yandell have all argued\nthat if individuals weaken their conviction that the specific\nteachings of their religion are correct, including the relevant moral\nteachings that prohibit intolerance, it might in turn actually make it\nmore likely that they will engage in intolerant behavior as it may\nwell deflate the very confidence in the relevant beliefs needed for\ninspiring tolerance (Craig 2008; McKim 2008; Yandell 2008). \nOthers, such as William Hasker, have questioned whether Quinn’s\nchallenge to those who hold firmly to the superiority of their\nreligious perspectives—that the reality of religious diversity\nrequires that they hold their perspectives less firmly—will have\nthe effect Quinn intended. It was his hope that those challenged in\nthis fashion would “soften” their exclusivistic\nconvictions and thus be less likely to engage in intolerant behavior.\nBut might not just the opposite occur? Might not those told that the\nreality of religious diversity reduces their justified confidence in\ntheir beliefs feel threatened and thus, in an attempt to “stand\nup for the truths” they still firmly believe, become even more\nintolerant of those with other perspectives (Hasker 2008)? \nThose sympathetic to Quinn’s position do not deny that some who find\nthe justification for their religious beliefs challenged might for\nthat reason find themselves with a weaker basis for refraining from\nintolerant behavior or become even more intolerant in defense of the\nbeliefs they continue to hold firmly. But those sympathetic to\nQuinn’s “pathway from diversity to tolerance” maintain that\nacknowledged religious diversity can, and often does, foster in\nindividuals (1) greater respect for their epistemic competitors and\ntheir positions and (2) a more flexible, inclusive understanding of\ntheir own position. And those who respect their competitors and have a\nmore inclusive understanding of their own perspectives, they add, are\nless likely to engage in inappropriate intolerant religious behavior\n(Basinger 2008; Dormandy 2020). \nThe discussion of religious diversity thus far has been framed in\nterms of truth claims (in terms of justified belief) because it is\nincreasingly recognized by philosophers as the best way to access the\nmost important questions that the reality of such diversity forces\nupon us. Historically, however, there has been one specific\n“diversity issue” with which philosophers of religion have\nbeen most concerned: the question of the eternal destiny of humankind,\nthat is, the question of who can spend eternity in God’s\npresence—who can obtain salvation. \nThose who are religious exclusivists on this question claim that\nthose, and only those, who have met the criteria set forth by one\nreligious perspective can spend eternity in God’s\n presence.[7]\n Adherents of other religious perspectives, it is acknowledged, can\naffirm truth related to some or many issues. But with respect to the\nquestion of salvation (one’s eternal destiny), a person must\ncome to understand and adhere to the unique way. Or, to be more\nspecific, as salvific exclusivists see it, the criteria for salvation\nspecified by the one correct religious perspective are both\nepistemologically necessary in the sense that those seeking salvation\nmust be aware of these conditions for salvation and ontologically\nnecessary in the sense that these conditions must really be met\n(Peterson et al. 2013,\n 322).[8] \nIt is important to note, though, that not only Christians are salvific\nexclusivists. For example, just as Christian salvific exclusivists\nmaintain that only those who respond appropriately to requirements set\nfor in Christian belief can spend eternity in God’s presence,\nMuslim salvific exclusivists maintain that “whether a person is\n‘saved’ or not is principally determined by whether he or\nshe responded appropriately to Islamic belief” (Aijaz 2014,\n194). \nAlso important to note is that differing, sometimes even conflicting,\nexclusivistic claims can exist within the same world religion. For\ninstance, significant intra-Christian debate has centered historically\non the eternal fate of young children who die. For some, the answer\nwas (and still is) that all children who die are separated from God\neternally. Others have believed that God “elects” some for\nheaven and allows the rest to spend eternity in hell, while still\nothers have held that only the deceased children of believers are\nallowed to enter heaven or that salvation for children who die is tied\nto the sacrament of baptism. A more common belief today among\nChristians, though, is that all those who die in early childhood (or\ndie having possessed only the mental capacities of young children)\nenter automatically into God’s eternal presence (Basinger 1992,\n4). \nBut what of those “adults” who die having never been aware\nof the salvific conditions of the one true religion? Is it not clearly\nunjust for exclusivists to claim that they cannot spend eternity with\nGod because they have not met the criteria for salvation stipulated by\nthis religion? For salvific inclusivists, the answer is yes. Like\nexclusivists, inclusivists believe that eternal existence in\nGod’s presence is only possible because of the salvific\nprovisions noted in the one true religion. However, they do not\nmaintain “that only the believers or practitioners of that religion,\nduring their earthly lives, will be redeemed” (Benton 2020).\nReligious inclusivists allow that some adherents of other religions\ncan be saved because of these provisions, even if the individuals in\nquestion haven’t made the personal commitments normally\nstipulated as necessary to appropriate these salvific provisions. Put\nin philosophical language, as inclusivists see it, particular salvific\nevents may be ontologically necessary for salvation in the sense that\nsalvation cannot occur without them but not epistemically necessary in\nthe sense that one need not know about them to be saved or liberated\n(Moser 2011; Peterson et al. 2013, 334). \nProbably the best known Christian proponent of this inclusivist\nperspective is Karl Rahner. Christianity, he argues, cannot recognize\nany other religion as providing the way to salvation. However, since\nGod is love and desires everyone to be saved, God can apply the\nresults of Jesus’s atoning death and resurrection to everyone,\neven to those who have never heard of Jesus and his death or have\nnever acknowledged his lordship. Just as adherents to pre-Christian\nJudaism were able, through the redemptive acts of Jesus of which they\nwere not aware, to enter God’s presence, so, too, is it possible\nfor adherents of other religions to enter God’s presence, even\nthough they are not aware of the necessary redemptive acts of Jesus\nthat makes this possible (Peterson et al. 2013, 334–335). \nInclusivists, it should be noted, differ on the conditions such\n“anonymous Christians” must meet. Some stipulate, for\ninstance, that those who have never heard “the gospel”\nstill have both some innate knowledge of God and the freedom to\nestablish a relationship with God and, therefore, that the eternal\ndestiny of those in this category is dependent on the extent to which\nthey commit as much as they know of themselves to as much as they know\nof God through, or even apart from, a religion other than\nChristianity. Other inclusivists don’t want to be as specific,\nmaintaining only that, because God is just, there will surely be some\nadherents of other religions who will be in God’s presence\nbecause they have met some set of divine conditions they have it\nwithin their power to meet. But all agree these “anonymous\nChristians” are the recipients of supernatural grace. \nMurtadha Mutahhari is a respected proponent of Muslim inclusivism. He\nmaintains that non-Muslims are at a disadvantage because it is the\nIslamic Divine Law that leads people to God. Those who fully\nunderstand this law (Islam) but choose not to accept the truth will be\ndamned. However, in accordance with Islamic jurisprudence, God will be\nmerciful to those who seek the truth but from whom, through no fault\nof their own, the reality of Islam remains hidden. Such people cannot\nbe called unbelievers; they are rather “dispositional Muslims”\nsince it is possible to possess the requisite spirit of submission\nwithout being Muslim in name. These individuals will receive the\ndivine grace necessary to achieve salvation from Hell (Mutahhari\n2006; Legenhausen 1997). Others go so far as to question whether\nMuslims can justifiably be exclusivists (Aijaz 2014). \nSalvific pluralists, however, find such reasoning no more convincing\nthan that offered by exclusivists. Inclusivists are right, pluralists\ngrant, to say that individuals need not necessarily know of or fulfill\ncertain requirements normally specified in a given religion to attain\nsalvation. But inclusivists, like exclusivists, are wrong to argue\nthat this salvation is, itself, possible only because of certain\nconditions or events described in the one true religion. There is no\none true religion and, therefore, no single path to eternal existence\nwith God. \nWhy, though, ought we consider this pluralistic salvific hypothesis\nmore plausible than that offered by the exclusivist or inclusivist?\nAccording to Hick, the most influential proponent of pluralism, three\nfactors make a pluralistic perspective the only plausible option.\nFirst, and foremost, he argues, is the reality of transformation\nparity. An efficacious salvific process is not just other-world\ncentered—does not simply give individuals a “ticket”\nto eternal existence with God. It begins “the transformation\nfrom self-centeredness to Reality-centeredness” in this life\n(Hick 1984, 229). That is, an efficacious salvific process changes\nlives in the sense that it begins to turn people from thinking about,\nand acting only to enhance, their own personal well-being to viewing\nthemselves as responsible participants in a much greater, more\nexpansive reality. In short, an efficacious salvific process makes its\nparticipants better people. And all the evidence we have, Hick\nmaintains, shows that many religions are equally transformational,\ngiven any general standard for positive transformation we might want\nto consider (Hick 1989, chapter 3). \nThere continues to be debate, however, over whether the same basic\npersonal transformation actually does occur within various\nreligions—over whether there is real transformational parity.\nFew claim that there is a strong experiential basis for denying such\ntransformational parity or that it can be demonstrated on other\nobjective, nonquestion-begging grounds that such parity does not\nexist. However, proponents of many basic theistic systems claim that\nwhile transformational parity may appear to be the case, this is\nactually not so—that is, claim that the transformation within\ntheir systems actually is qualitatively different than that produced\nby allegiance to other systems. It is sometimes argued, for instance,\nthat the transformation within other systems will not last, or at\nleast that this transformation, while possibly real and even lasting\nfor a given individual, is not what it could have been for that\nindividual within the one true theistic system. And some exclusivists\nhave argued that unless it can be demonstrated in an objective,\nnonquestion-begging sense that they are not justified in affirming a\nreligious perspective that makes such claims (which even Hick does not\nattempt to demonstrate), they are justified in denying that such\nparity actually exists (Clark 1997, 303–320). \nIt can also be argued that focusing on transformational parity can be\nused as an argument against salvific pluralism. The basis for this\nclaim is the fact that people making a “secular”\n(non-religious) commitment to some goal, value, or metaphysical\nperspective—be it concern for the environment or world hunger or\nemotional health—often appear to have their lives transformed in\nways quite similar to the ways in which the lives of religious\nbelievers are transformed. They, too, appear to have changed from\nself-centeredness to a focus on reality outside of self. If this is\nso, however, then might it not be that the religious transformational\nparity we observe is simply a sub-set of the general transformational\nparity we find among individuals who commit themselves to any\nperspective on life that centers reality outside of self, and thus\nthat it is just as plausible to assume that all religious\ntransformational parity is the result of some form of internal\nconceptual realignment than the result of some form of connection with\nan external divine reality? And if this is the case, then\ntransformational parity is at least weakened as support for any\nsalvific perspective, whether pluralistic, inclusivistic, or\nexclusivistic. \nSeeming transformational parity is not, however, Hick’s only\nreason for believing non-pluralistic salvific perspectives to be\nuntenable. A credible perspective, he tells us, must account for the\nfact, “evident to ordinary people (even though not always taken\ninto account by theologians) that in the great majority of\ncases—say 98 to 99 percent—the religion in which a person\nbelieves and to which he adheres depends upon where he was born”\n(Hick 1980, 44). Given this fact—given that “religious\nallegiance depends in the great majority of cases on the accident of\nbirth”—it seems implausible to hold that “being born\nin our particular part of the world carries with it the privilege of\nknowing the full religious truth” (Hick 1997a, 287). \nThis contention, though, has also been challenged. No one denies that\nthe admittedly high correlation between where and when individuals are\nborn and the religious perspective they affirm is relevant and might\nin fact negatively affect an exclusivist’s confidence. But many\nexclusivists deny that a pluralistic explanation should be seen as the\nonly plausible option. As they see it, exclusivists need not consider\nthe high place-time/religious allegiance correlation in question in\nisolation from other relevant beliefs. For example, Christian\nexclusivists need not consider this correlation in isolation from\ntheir basic belief that the Bible is an authoritative source of truth\nand that the Bible teaches that only the Christian perspective\ncontains a totally accurate view of reality. And it is justifiable,\nsome maintain, for exclusivists to consider the plausibility of such\nrelevant background beliefs to outweigh the seeming counterevidence\nposed by the correlation in question (Plantinga 2000, 187; Plantinga\n1997, 198). \nFinally, Hick argues, a credible religious hypothesis must account for\nthe fact, of which “we have become irreversibly aware in the\npresent century, as the result of anthropological, sociological, and\npsychological studies and the work of philosophy of language,”\nthat there is no one universal and invariable pattern for the\ninterpretation of human experience, but rather a range of\nsignificantly different patterns or conceptual schemes “which\nhave developed within the major cultural streams.” When\nconsidered in this light, a “pluralistic theory becomes\ninevitable” (Hick 1984, 232). \nWhile no one denies that culture shapes reality to some extent, it can\nagain be argued that when comparing the plausibility of specific\nbeliefs, we must consider not only these specific beliefs themselves\nbut also the basic background beliefs in which they are embedded.\nThus, even if we grant that a pluralistic response to the obvious\nshaping power of culture is preferable to any exclusivistic response\nwhen such shaping power is considered in isolation, it isn’t\nclear that exclusivists must acknowledge that Hick’s hypothesis\nis so strong that it renders implausible the whole set of basic\nbackground beliefs out of which the exclusivist’s response to\nthe profound shaping influence of culture on religious belief arises.\nHence, it isn’t clear that exclusivists can’t justifiably\nreject Hick’s contention that a pluralistic cultural/religious\ninterpretation of reality must inevitably be considered superior. \nHick argues for salvific pluralism on what might best be called\nmetaphysical or epistemological grounds. Other philosophers, however,\nhave attempted to make a moral case for salvific pluralism (or at\nleast against salvific exclusivism.) For instance, Kenneth Himma has\nargued that moral considerations require Christian salvific\nexclusivism to be rejected (Himma 2002, 1–33). It follows both\nfrom God’s perfection and conceptual truths about punishment,\nHimma maintains, that God would not punish individuals who are not\nmorally culpable for their behavior. But those with non-Christian\nbeliefs are generally not morally culpable for the fact that they hold\nthese beliefs. Not only is it not the case that any objective line of\nreasoning demonstrates the Christian (or any other religious) path to\nsalvation to be the correct one, religious traditions are, themselves,\nextremely elastic. That is, because of the shaping, foundational\nnature of basic religious belief, devout proponents of any given\nreligion are capable of (in fact, usually simply find themselves)\noffering self-consistent responses to almost any challenge to their\nsalvific perspective, no matter how strong or damaging this challenge\nmight seem on the surface. Furthermore, sociological, psychological,\nand anthropological studies have confirmed that while one’s\nbasic religious beliefs are not inevitable, they are quite often to a\nsignificant extent “beyond the direct volitional control of the\nbeliever” (Himma 2002, 18). So we must conclude, argues Himma,\nthat it would not be morally just for the Christian God to deny\nsalvation to devout people of other faiths. \nNot surprisingly, many inclusivists and pluralists will find this\nbasic line of reasoning persuasive. However, some (although not all)\nexclusivists reject the basic moral assumption on which Himma’s\nargument is based: that we are in a position to correctly identify\nsome of the basic moral principles that guide God’s interaction\nwith us as humans. Specifically, while many Christian exclusivists do\nbelieve that God’s behavior is guided by the same basic\nprinciples of justice and fairness that are so fundamental to our\nhuman moral thinking, this is not true for all. There is a strong\nChristian tradition that holds that God is under no obligation to\ntreat any individual in what we would consider a just, fair fashion.\nGod can do what God wants (including how God responds to those who\nhaven’t affirmed Christian beliefs) for whatever purposes God\nhas. What God does is right simply because God does\n it.[9]\n Even among those Christian exclusivists who come to acknowledge\nHimma’s basic point—that a just God cannot condemn those\nwho aren’t culpable for their non-Christian beliefs—the\nresponse has normally not been to reject their overall exclusivistic\nperspective. It is often simply assumed, rather, that\n“God’s ways are above our ways” in some manner\nunfathomable to the human mind. \nHowever, even if we were to agree with pluralists that both\nexclusivists and inclusivists are wrong to claim that the basis for\ntrue salvation can be found in only one religion, the question of what\ntype of pluralistic hypothesis we ought to affirm remains. Hick,\nhimself, favors what might be called a selective pluralism that\ncenters on the world’s great religions. Hick has never denied\nthat the major world religions—Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism,\nIslam—make conflicting truth claims. In fact, he believes that\n“the differences of belief between (and within) the traditions\nare legion” and has often discussed these conflicts in great\ndetail (Hick 1983, 487). His basic pluralistic claim, rather, is that\nsuch differences are best seen as differing ways in which differing\ncultures have conceived of and experienced the one ultimate divine\nReality. Each major religious perspective “constitutes a valid\ncontext of salvation/liberation; but none constitutes the one and only\nsuch context” (Hick 1984, 229, 231). \nWhy, however, select only the paths offered by the world’s great\nreligions as ways to salvation? For Hick, the answer lies in the fact\nthat, unlike “Satanism, Nazism, the Order of the Solar Temple,\netc.,” the world’s great religions offer paths that lead\nus away from “hatred, misery, aggression, unkindness,\nimpatience, violence, and lack of self-control” to love, joy,\npeace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and\nself-control (Hick 1997b, 164). Some, though, see this sort of ethical\nstandard for acceptable salvific perspectives to be as arbitrary as\nthe standard for acceptable paths to salvation set forth by\nexclusivists or inclusivists (Meeker 2003, 5). In fact, some have\nquestioned whether, given this rather specific ethical criterion for\nassessing the salvific adequacy of religions, Hick’s perspective\nshould actually be considered pluralistic at all. \nS. Mark Heim, for instance, argues that pluralists such as Hick are\nreally inclusivists in disguise in that they advocate only one path to\nsalvation—the transformation from self-centeredness to\nReality-centeredness—and thus in essence deny that diverse\nreligions have real, fundamental salvific differences. A better, more\nhonest salvific pluralism, we are told, is to acknowledge that each\nreligion has its own path to salvation that may be either similar to\nor different from that of other religions. That is, a more honest\npluralistic perspective is to deny that the seemingly different\nsalvific paths offered by various religious traditions are all just\nculturally distinct manifestations of the same fundamental path and\nmaintain instead that salvific paths of various religions remain\nincompatible, but equally valid ways to achieve salvation. It is\nacknowledged that this is not to say, of course, that all the details\nof all the salvific paths are actually true since some of the relevant\nclaims are inconsistent. But the appropriate response to this is not\nto claim there is one true path to salvation. It is rather to claim\nthat many distinct paths, while remaining distinct, can lead to\nsalvation (Heim 1995). \nCritics, however, wonder whether part of this seeming disagreement is\nverbal in nature. Heim can appear to be bypassing the question of\nwhether there is some sort of final, ultimate eschatological salvific\nstate that the proponents of various religious perspectives will all\nexperience, emphasizing rather that many distinct religious paths can\nliberate people (produce salvation) here and now (Peterson et al.\n2013, 333). Hick, on the other hand, seems most concerned with the\nnature of salvific reality—with what it means to experience\nsalvation—while not denying that there exist in this world\ndistinct ways that remain distinct to access this ultimate\nreality. \nPublic education in Western culture has always been to some extent a\n“melting pot.”[10] But the increasing number of students with\nnon-Western cultural values and religious traditions is causing public\nschool educators to grapple in new and sometimes uncomfortable ways\nwith the challenges such diversity poses. Some of these challenges are\npractical—e.g., should Muslim girls be allowed to wear hijabs,\nshould schools designate only Christian religious holy days as school\nholidays? The focus of this section, however, will be a pedagogical\nquestion of increasing interest in the philosophy of education: How\nought the increasing religious diversity to which students are exposed\naffect public school curricula? \nMost public school educators agree that increasing student\nunderstanding of diverse religious perspectives is important as this\nwill have positive social outcomes. It is often argued, for instance,\nthat helping students better understand the increasing diversity,\nincluding religious diversity, they face will better prepare them to\nlive in a peaceful, productive manner with those with differing\ncultural and/or religious values (Kunzman 2006). \nMany educators, however, want to go further. It is also important,\nthey maintain, for students to clarify their feelings about other\nreligions and their followers. Specifically, they want to foster a\nmore empathetic understanding of other religious perspectives, an\nunderstanding that encourages students to appreciate the other\nreligions from the perspective of an adherent of that religion\n(Kunzman 2006). While few challenge this as a valid goal, there is,\nthough, continuing controversy over one common method by which\neducators attempt to engender this type of empathy in students. As\nsome see it, while having students think about diverse religions is an\nimportant step past the mere dissemination of factual information\ntoward empathetic understanding, having students directly experience\nthese religions in some way—for instance, having students visit\na local mosque or having a representative from a Hindu Temple share\nwith students in a class—is also necessary (or at least very\ndesirable). Not surprisingly, though, while no one denies that these\nforms of direct experience might broaden a student’s empathetic\nunderstanding of a religion, concerns have been raised. \nFirst, some believe that having students experience a religion, even\nas “observers,” can test the limits of the separation of church\nand state. While the intent of having students attend a mosque or\nhaving a Buddhist talk with students is seldom to “promote” a\nreligion, the line between “exposure” and intended or unintended\npromotion (and even proselytization), they maintain, is a fine one.\nThis is especially the case given the widely varying communication\nskills and deeply embedded values and preconceptions of the teacher\nand/or the representatives of a given religion to whom students might\nbe exposed. Second, there is growing ethical concern that to\nexperience a religion as an observer might in some cases trivialize or\ndemean the religion in question. Some Native Americans, for instance,\nare becoming increasingly concerned with the growing desire of\n“outsiders” to seek understanding of their religion(s) by watching\nor experiencing sacred ceremonies since such observation, they\nbelieve, can trivialize these ceremonies (Kasprisin 2003: 422). \nIs it justifiable for the public school educator to go even further\nthan the dissemination of accurate information and the attempted\nengendering of empathetic understanding? Specifically, ought an\neducator attempt to bring it about that all students affirm a core set\nof “appropriate” beliefs about other religions and their\nadherents? \nIt is clearly the case that almost all public school educators\ncurrently do attempt to bring it about that students hold certain\nbeliefs related to pervasive human characteristics, such as race,\ngender, and disabling conditions. Students are encouraged, for\ninstance, to continue to believe, or come to believe, that engaging in\nintolerant or discriminatory behavior is wrong and that they should\naffirm, or come to affirm, the inherent worth and rights of the\ndisabled, those of other racial/ethnic backgrounds, etc. So if the\ndesire is simply to also encourage students to believe it wrong to\ntreat those of other religions in intolerant or discriminatory ways\nand to believe it right to accept those of other religions as persons\nwith equal inherent value, few will object. \nHowever, need teachers stop there? Might there not be other beliefs\nabout religions and their adherents that public school educators can\njustifiably attempt to bring it about that all students accept? We can\nextrapolate from some work on religious diversity by Robert Wuthnow to\nintroduce two beliefs that some might propose fit into this category.\nAs Wuthnow sees it, the most appropriate response to the increasing\nreligious diversity we face in the United States is what he labels\n“reflective pluralism” (Wuthnow 2005: 286–307). To engage\nin this sort of reflection, he tells us, is not simply to become\nbetter informed, or to strive to “live peacefully with those with\nwhom one disagrees” (be tolerant), or even to attempt to develop an\nempathetic understanding of diverse religions. It is to engage\nintentionally and purposefully with “people and groups whose\nreligious practices are fundamentally different from one’s own”\n(Wuthnow 2005: 289). And such engagement, as he understands it,\nincludes both (1) the recognition that since all of our beliefs,\nincluding our religious beliefs, depend on a point of view “shaped\nby the culture in which we live,” we should not regard our “own\nposition[s] as inherently superior” and (2) “a principled\nwillingness to compromise” in the sense that we must be willing to\nmove out of our social and emotional comfort levels “in order to\narrive at a workable relationship with another person” (Wuthnow\n2005: 292). \nThe benefit of this form of engagement, we are told, is not only that\nit can minimize the likelihood of the sorts of “religious\ntensions, conflicts, and violence [that] have been so much a part of\nhuman history” (Wuthnow 2005: 293). Such reflective engagement\nalso allows us to focus on “the shared concerns for basic human\ndignity” found in the teachings of many of the world’s\nreligions, which can furnish a basis for inter-religious cooperation\nto combat social ills and meet basic social needs (Wuthnow 2005:\n294). \nIt is important to note that Wuthnow does not explicitly claim or deny\nthat encouraging students in a public school setting to become\nreflective pluralists would be appropriate. But not only does he\nhighlight two increasingly popular pluralistic claims about\nreligions—(1) that the beliefs of many religions are equally\nvalid expressions of faith, expressions that adherents of these\nreligions should be allowed or even encouraged to maintain and (2)\nthat religious believers of all faiths should identify and focus on\nwhat these religions have in common—he highlights what such\npluralists often note as the main benefits of widespread affirmation\nof these beliefs: a reduction in violent religious conflicts and an\nincrease in socially beneficial inter-religious cooperation. And these\noutcomes are clearly quite compatible with what we have seen to be a\nkey reason why public school educators want to increase student\nunderstanding of other religions—namely, their desire to better\nprepare students to live in a peaceful, productive manner in social\ncontexts that will increasingly be characterized by religious\ndiversity. Accordingly, since it seems reasonable to believe that\nwidespread acceptance of the validity of diverse religious\nperspectives and increased focus on the commonalities in diverse\nreligions might well result in more peaceful, mutually beneficial\ninteraction among followers of diverse religions, the question of\nwhether public school teachers can justifiably attempt to bring it\nabout that students affirm the beliefs in question appears worthy of\nexploration. \nLet’s first consider the contention that many religions contain\nequally valid expressions of faith. Even if we make the debatable\nassumption that this is true, it won’t be clear to many that public\nschool teachers could justifiably attempt to bring it about that their\nstudents believed this to be so. The problem is that various religions\naffirm conflicting doctrinal beliefs on significant issues. For\nexample, while conservative Christians maintain that one must affirm\ncertain beliefs about the saving power of Christ to spend eternity in\nGod’s presence, conservative Muslims strongly deny this. Orthodox\nChristians and Muslims are taught not only that the sacred scriptures\nof other religions contain false beliefs; they are often encouraged to\ntry to convert those of other religions to their religious\nperspective. And while many Muslims and Christians believe in a\npersonal supernatural creator and personally immortality, some\nBuddhists deny both. This, however, means that an educator can\njustifiably attempt to convince students that all religions are\nequally valid expressions of faith only if she or he can justifiably\nattempt to convince conservative proponents of some of these religions\nthat some of their core doctrinal beliefs need to be modified or\nrejected. To attempt to do this in a public school setting will be\nseen by many as violating the prohibition against both restricting the\nfree exercise of religion and promoting a given religion (Basinger\n2010) \nMight it not, though, at least be justifiable for a public school\neducator to encourage students to respect the right of adherents to\nother religions to retain their current religious beliefs? If we\ninterpret this as asking whether an educator can justifiably encourage\nstudents not to attempt to prohibit adherents to other religions from\nexpressing and acting in accordance with their beliefs, a positive\nresponse is noncontroversial since this is only to say once again that\neducators should encourage students to be tolerant. However, to\nencourage respect for the religious beliefs of others often carries\nwith it the explicit or implicit assumption that it is inappropriate,\nif not unethical, to attempt to convince adherents of one religion to\nconvert to another. And for a public school educator to attempt to\nconvince all students that it is wrong to proselytize will again be\nseen by some as placing this educator in the legally and morally\nquestionable position of attempting to convince some students to\nreject or modify what for them is a very fundamental, core religious\nbelief. \nPerhaps, however, there is a different, less controversial option for\nthose educators who want to do more than simply encourage tolerance of\nexpression and empathetic understanding. Is it not at least\njustifiable for the public school teacher to attempt to point out the\nimportant common values affirmed by most of the world’s major\nreligions, values that we can all accept and should all desire to see\nlived out? Is it not justifiable for an educator to point out, for\ninstance, that most of the world’s major religions prohibit such\nthings as killing, lying, stealing, dehumanizing racism, and sexual\nexploitation, and that these same religions encourage such things as\nhelping those in need and treating adherents of other religions with\nrespect. To do so, it has been argued, would not simply be of value\nwithin the classroom or community. Since religious convictions clearly\ninfluence social, political, and economic activity on a global scale,\nemphasizing the shared common values of religions has the potential to\nfacilitate better global relationships. And to encourage such\nrelationships is surely an appropriate goal of public education\n(Shingleton 2008). \nSome, of course, will see any focus on “positive\ncommonalities” as yet another thinly veiled attempt to encourage\nstudents to modify their current religious beliefs in ways that make\nsuch beliefs more accommodating of other religious perspectives.\nHowever, most see no legal or ethical reason why a teacher should not\nexpose students to the “positive commonalities” in diverse\nreligious perspectives, and many see this as a helpful step. \nAs we have seen, discussions of religious diversity lend themselves to\nno easy answers. The issues are many, the arguments complex, and the\nresponses varied. It would be hard, though, to overstate the practical\nsignificance of this topic. While some (many) issues that philosophers\ndiscuss have practical implications for how we view ourselves and\ntreat others, none is more relevant today than the question of\nreligious diversity. Religious convictions have not only motivated\nimpassioned behavior in the past—behavior that has affected\nsignificantly the lives of many—such convictions clearly\ncontinue to do so today. So continuing philosophical discussions of\nreligious diversity that clarify issues and assess arguments have the\npotential to be of great practical value.","contact.mail":"basingerd@roberts.edu","contact.domain":"roberts.edu"}]
