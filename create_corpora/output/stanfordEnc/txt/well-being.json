The\nquestion of what well-being consists in is of independent interest,\nbut it is of great importance in moral philosophy, especially in the\ncase of utilitarianism, according to which the only moral requirement is that well-being be maximized. Significant challenges to the very notion have been mounted,\nin particular by G.E. Moore and T.M. Scanlon. It has become standard\nto distinguish theories of well-being as either hedonist theories,\ndesire theories, or objective list theories. According to the view\nknown as welfarism, well-being is the only value. Also important in\nethics is the question of how a person’s moral character and actions relate to their well-being.\n\n\n\nPopular use of the term ‘well-being’ usually relates to\nhealth. A doctor’s surgery may run a ‘Women’s\nWell-being Clinic’, for example. Philosophical use is broader,\nbut related, and amounts to the notion of how well a person’s\nlife is going for that person. A person’s well-being is what is\n‘good for’ them. Health, then, might be said to be a\nconstituent of my well-being, but it is not plausibly taken to be all\nthat matters for my well-being. One correlate term worth noting here\nis ‘self-interest’: my self-interest is what is in the\ninterest of myself, and not others. \n\nThe philosophical use of the term also tends to encompass the\n‘negative’ aspects of how a person’s life goes for\nthem. So we may speak of the well-being of someone who is, and will\nremain in, the most terrible agony: their well-being is negative, and\nsuch that their life is worse for them than no life at all. The same\nis true of closely allied terms, such as ‘welfare’, which\ncovers how a person is faring as a whole, whether well or badly, or\n‘happiness’, which can be understood—as it sometimes was by\nthe classical utilitarians from Jeremy Bentham onwards, for\nexample—to be the balance between good and bad things in a\nperson’s life.  But note that philosophers also use such terms in the\nmore standard ‘positive’ way, speaking of\n‘ill-being’, ‘ill-faring’, or, of course,\n‘unhappiness’ to capture the negative aspects of\nindividuals’ lives. \n\n‘Happiness’ is often used, in ordinary life, to refer to a\nshort-lived state of a person, frequently a feeling of contentment:\n‘You look happy today’; ‘I’m very happy for\nyou’. Philosophically, its scope is more often wider,\nencompassing a whole life. And in philosophy it is possible to speak\nof the happiness of a person’s life, or of their happy life,\neven if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable. The point\nis that some good things in their life made it a happy one, even\nthough they lacked contentment. But this usage is uncommon, and may cause confusion. \n\nOver the last few decades, so-called ‘positive psychology’\nhas hugely increased the attention paid by psychologists and other\nscientists to the notion of ‘happiness’. Such happiness is\nusually understood in terms of contentment or\n‘life-satisfaction’, and is measured by means such as\nself-reports or daily questionnaires. Is positive psychology about\nwell-being? As yet, conceptual distinctions are not sufficiently clear\nwithin the discipline. But it is probably fair to say that many of\nthose involved, as researchers or as subjects, are assuming that one’s\nlife goes well to the extent that one is contented with it—that\nis, that some kind of hedonistic account of well-being is\ncorrect. Some positive psychologists, however, explicitly reject\nhedonistic theories in preference to Aristotelian or\n‘eudaimonist’ accounts of well-being, which are a version\nof the ‘objective list’ theory of well-being discussed\nbelow. A leader in the field, Martin Seligman, for example, has\nrecently suggested that, rather than happiness, positive psychology\nshould concern itself with positive emotion, engagement,\nrelationships, meaning and accomplishment (‘Perma’)\n(Seligman 2011).  \n\nWhen discussing the notion of what makes life good for the individual\nliving that life, it is preferable to use the term\n‘well-being’ instead of ‘happiness’. For we want\nat least to allow conceptual space for the possibility that, for\nexample, the life of a plant may be ‘good for’ that\nplant. And speaking of the happiness of a plant would be stretching\nlanguage too far. (An alternative here might be\n‘flourishing’, though this might be taken to bias the\nanalysis of human well-being in the direction of some kind of natural\nteleology.) In that respect, the Greek word commonly translated\n‘happiness’ (eudaimonia) might be thought to be\nsuperior. But, in fact, eudaimonia seems to have\nbeen restricted not only to conscious beings, but to human beings: non-human animals\ncannot be eudaimon. This is because eudaimonia\nsuggests that the gods, or fortune, have favoured one, and the idea\nthat the gods could care about non-humans would not have occurred to\nmost Greeks. \n\nIt is occasionally claimed that certain ancient ethical theories,\nsuch as Aristotle’s, result in the collapse of the very notion of\nwell-being. On Aristotle’s view, if you are my friend, then my\nwell-being is closely bound up with yours. It might be tempting, then,\nto say that ‘your’ well-being is ‘part’ of\nmine, in which case the distinction between what is good for me and\nwhat is good for others has broken down. But this temptation should be\nresisted. Your well-being concerns how well your life goes for you, and\nwe can allow that my well-being depends on yours without introducing\nthe confusing notion that my well-being is constituted by yours. There\nare signs in Aristotelian thought of an expansion of the subject or\nowner of well-being. A friend is ‘another self’, so that\nwhat benefits my friend benefits me. But this should be taken either as\na metaphorical expression of the dependence claim, or as an identity\nclaim which does not threaten the notion of well-being: if you really\nare the same person as I am, then of course what is good for you will\nbe what is good for me, since there is no longer any metaphysically\nsignificant distinction between you and me. \n Well-being is a kind of value, sometimes called ‘prudential\nvalue’, to be distinguished from, for example, aesthetic value\nor moral value. What marks it out is the notion of ‘good\nfor’. The serenity of a Vermeer painting, for instance, is a kind\nof goodness, but it is not ‘good for’ the painting. It may\nbe good for us to contemplate such serenity, but contemplating\nserenity is not the same as the serenity itself. Likewise, my giving\nmoney to a development charity may have moral value, that is, be\nmorally good. And the effects of my donation may be good for\nothers. But it remains an open question whether my being morally good\nis good for me; and, if it is, its being good for me is still\nconceptually distinct from its being morally good.   \n\nThere is something mysterious about the notion of ‘good\nfor’. Consider a possible world that contains only a single\nitem: a stunning Vermeer painting. Leave aside any doubts you might\nhave about whether paintings can be good in a world without viewers,\nand accept for the sake of argument that this painting has aesthetic\nvalue in that world. It seems intuitively plausible to claim that\nthe value of this world is constituted solely by the aesthetic value\nof the painting. But now consider a world which contains one\nindividual living a life that is good for them. How are we to describe\nthe relationship between the value of this world, and the value of the\nlife lived in it for the individual? Are we to say that the world has\na value at all?  How can it, if the only value it contains is\n‘good for’ as opposed to just ‘good’? And yet\nwe surely do want to say that this world is better (‘more\ngood’) than some other empty world. Well, should we say that the\nworld is good, and is so because of the good it contains\n‘for’ the individual? This fails to capture the idea that\nthere is in fact nothing of value in this world except what is good for\nthe individual. \n\nThoughts such as these led G.E. Moore to object to the very idea of\n‘good for’ (Moore 1903, pp. 98–9). Moore argued that the\nidea of ‘my own good’, which he saw as equivalent to what\nis ‘good for me’, makes no sense. When I speak of, say,\npleasure as what is good for me, he claimed, I can mean only either\nthat the pleasure I get is good, or that my getting it is good.\nNothing is added by saying that the pleasure constitutes my good, or\nis good for me. \n\nBut the distinctions I drew between different categories of value\nabove show that Moore’s analysis of the claim that my own good\nconsists in pleasure is too narrow. Indeed Moore’s argument\nrests on the very assumption that it seeks to prove: that only the\nnotion of ‘good’ is necessary to make all the evaluative\njudgements we might wish to make. The claim that it is good that I\nget pleasure is, logically speaking, equivalent to the claim that the\nworld containing the single Vermeer is good. It is, so to speak,\n‘impersonal’, and leaves out of account the special feature\nof the value of well-being: that it is good for individuals. \nOne way to respond both to Moore’s challenge, and to the\npuzzles above, is to try, when appropriate, to do without the notion\nof ‘good’ (see Kraut 2011) and make do with ‘good for’,\nalongside the separate and non-evaluative notion of reasons for\naction. Thus, the world containing the single individual with a life\nworth living, might be said to contain nothing good per se,\nbut a life that is good for that individual. And this fact may give us\na reason to bring about such a world, given the opportunity.   \n\nMoore’s book was published in Cambridge, England, at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century. At the end of the same century, a\nbook was published in Cambridge, Mass., which also posed some serious\nchallenges to the notion of well-being: What Do We Owe to Each\nOther?, by T.M. Scanlon. \n\nMoore’s ultimate aim in criticizing the idea of ‘goodness\nfor’ was to attack egoism. Likewise, Scanlon has an ulterior\nmotive in objecting to the notion of well-being—to attack\nso-called ‘teleological’ or end-based theories of ethics, in\nparticular, utilitarianism, which in its standard form requires us to\nmaximize well-being. But in both cases the critiques stand\nindependently. \n\nOne immediately odd aspect of Scanlon’s position that\n‘well-being’ is an otiose notion in ethics is that he\nhimself seems to have a view on what well-being is. It involves, he\nbelieves, among other things, success in one’s rational aims, and\npersonal relations. But Scanlon claims that his view is not a\n‘theory of well-being’, since a theory must explain what\nunifies these different elements, and how they are to be\ncompared. And, he adds, no such theory is ever likely to be available,\nsince such matters depend so much on context. \n\nScanlon does, however, implicitly make a claim about what unites\nthese values: they are all constituents of well-being, as opposed to\nother kinds of value, such as aesthetic or moral. Nor is it clear why\nScanlon’s view of well-being could not be developed so as to\nassist in making real-life choices between different values in\none’s own life. \n\nScanlon suggests that we often make claims about what is good in our\nlives without referring to the notion of well-being, and indeed that\nit would often be odd to do so. For example, I might say, ‘I\nlisten to Alison Krauss’s music because I enjoy it’, and\nthat will be sufficient. I do not need to go on to say, ‘And\nenjoyment adds to my well-being’. \n\nBut this latter claim sounds peculiar only because we already\nknow that enjoyment makes a person’s life better for\nthem. And in some circumstances such a claim would anyway not be odd:\nconsider an argument with someone who claims that aesthetic\nexperience is worthless, or with an ascetic. Further, people do use\nthe notion of well-being in practical thinking. For example, if I am\ngiven the opportunity to achieve something significant, which will\ninvolve considerable discomfort over several years, I may consider\nwhether, from the point of view of my own well-being, the project is\nworth pursuing. \n\nScanlon argues also that the notion of well-being, if it is to be\nphilosophically acceptable, ought to provide a ‘sphere of\ncompensation’—a context in which it makes sense to say,\nfor example, that I am losing one good in my life for the sake of\ngain over my life as a whole. And, he claims, there is no such\nsphere. For Scanlon, giving up present comfort for the sake of future\nhealth ‘feels like a sacrifice’. \n\nBut this does not chime with my own experience. When I donate blood,\nthis feels to me like a sacrifice. But when I visit the dentist, it\nfeels to me just as if I am weighing present pains against\npotential future pains. And we can weigh different components of\nwell-being against one another. Consider a case in which you are\noffered a job which is highly paid but many miles away from your friends and\nfamily. \n Scanlon denies that we need an account of well-being to understand\nbenevolence, since we do not have a general duty of benevolence, but\nmerely duties to benefit others in specific ways, such as to relieve\ntheir pain. But, from the philosophical perspective, it may be quite\nuseful to use the heading of ‘benevolence’ in order to\ngroup such duties. And, again, comparisons may be important: if I\nhave several pro tanto duties of benevolence, not all of\nwhich can be fulfilled, I shall have to weigh the various benefits\nI can provide against one another. And here the notion of well-being\nwill again come into play. \n Further, if morality includes so-called ’imperfect’ duties\nto benefit others, that is, duties that allow the agent some\ndiscretion as to when and how to assist, the lack of any overarching\nconception of well-being is likely to make the fulfillment of such\nduties problematic. \n\nOn one view, human beings always act in pursuit of what they think\nwill give them the greatest balance of pleasure over pain. This is\n‘psychological hedonism’, and will not be my concern\nhere. Rather, I intend to discuss ‘evaluative hedonism’ or\n‘prudential hedonism’, according to which well-being\nconsists in the greatest balance of pleasure over pain. \n\nThis view was first, and perhaps most famously, expressed by Socrates\nand Protagoras in the Platonic dialogue, Protagoras (Plato\n1976 [C4 BCE], 351b–c). Jeremy Bentham, one of the most well-known\nof the more recent hedonists, begins his Introduction to the\nPrinciples of Morals and Legislation thus: ‘Nature has\nplaced mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters,\npain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point\nout what we ought to do’. \n\nIn answer to the question, ‘What does well-being consist\nin?’, then, the hedonist will answer, ‘The greatest\nbalance of pleasure over pain’. We might call this\nsubstantive hedonism. A complete hedonist position will\ninvolve also explanatory hedonism, which consists in an answer to\nthe following question: ‘What makes pleasure good, and\npain bad?’, that answer being, ‘The pleasantness of\npleasure, and the painfulness of pain’. Consider a substantive\nhedonist who believed that what makes pleasure good for us is that it\nfulfills our nature. This theorist is not an explanatory hedonist. \n\nHedonism—as is demonstrated by its ancient roots—has\nlong seemed an obviously plausible view. Well-being, what is good\nfor me, might be thought to be naturally linked to what\nseems good to me, and pleasure does, to most people, seem\ngood. And how could anything else benefit me except in so far as I enjoy\nit? \n\nThe simplest form of hedonism is Bentham’s, according to which\nthe more pleasantness one can pack into one’s life, the better\nit will be, and the more painfulness one encounters, the worse it\nwill be.  How do we measure the value of the two experiences? The two\ncentral aspects of the respective experiences, according to Bentham,\nare their duration, and their intensity. \n\nBentham tended to think of pleasure and pain as a kind of sensation,\nas the notion of intensity might suggest. One problem with this kind\nof hedonism, it has often been claimed, is that there does not appear to be a single common strand of pleasantness running through all the different experiences\npeople enjoy, such as eating hamburgers, reading Shakespeare, or\nplaying water polo. Rather, it seems, there are certain experiences we\nwant to continue, and we might be prepared to call these—for\nphilosophical purposes—pleasures (even though some of them,\nsuch as diving in a very deep and narrow cave, for example, would not\nnormally be described as pleasurable). \n\nHedonism could survive this objection merely by\nincorporating whatever view of pleasure was thought to be\nplausible. A more serious objection is to the evaluative stance of\nhedonism itself.  Thomas Carlyle, for example, described the\nhedonistic component of utilitarianism as the ‘philosophy of\nswine’, the point being that simple hedonism places all\npleasures on a par, whether they be the lowest animal pleasures of\nsex or the highest of aesthetic appreciation. One might make this\npoint with a thought experiment.  Imagine that you are given the\nchoice of living a very fulfilling human life, or that of a barely\nsentient oyster, which experiences some very low-level\npleasure. Imagine also that the life of the oyster can be as long as\nyou like, whereas the human life will be of eighty years only.  If\nBentham were right, there would have to be a length of oyster life\nsuch that you would choose it in preference to the human. And yet\nmany say that they would choose the human life in preference to an\noyster life of any length. \n\nNow this is not a knockdown argument against simple hedonism. Indeed\nsome people are ready to accept that at some length or other the\noyster life becomes preferable. But there is an alternative to simple\nhedonism, outlined famously by J.S. Mill, using his distinction\n(itself influenced by Plato’s discussion of pleasure at the end\nof his Republic (Plato 1992 [C4 BCE], 582d-583a)) between\n‘higher’ and ‘lower’ pleasures (1863 [1998],\nch. 2). Mill added a third property to the two determinants of value\nidentified by Bentham, duration and intensity. To distinguish it from\nthese two ‘quantitative’ properties, Mill called his third\nproperty ‘quality’. The claim is that some pleasures, by\ntheir very nature, are more valuable than others. For example, the\npleasure of reading Shakespeare, by its very nature, is more valuable\nthan any amount of basic animal pleasure. And we can see this, Mill\nsuggests, if we note that those who have experienced both types, and\nare ‘competent judges’, will make their choices on this\nbasis. \n\nA long-standing objection to Mill’s move here has been to claim that\nhis position can no longer be described as hedonism proper (or what I\nhave called ‘explanatory hedonism’). If higher pleasures\nare higher because of their nature, that aspect of their nature cannot\nbe pleasantness, since that could be determined by duration and\nintensity alone. And Mill anyway speaks of properties such as\n‘nobility’ as adding to the value of a pleasure. Now it\nhas to be admitted that Mill is sailing close to the wind here. But\nthere is logical space for a hedonist position which allows properties\nsuch as nobility to determine pleasantness, and insists that only\npleasantness determines value. But one might well wonder how nobility\ncould affect pleasantness, and why Mill did not just come out with the\nidea that nobility is itself a good-making property. \n\nBut there is a yet more weighty objection to hedonism of any kind: the\nso-called ‘experience machine’. Imagine that I have a\nmachine that I could plug you into for the rest of your life. This\nmachine would give you experiences of whatever kind you thought most\nvaluable or enjoyable—writing a great novel, bringing about\nworld peace, attending an early Rolling Stones’ gig. You would not\nknow you were on the machine, and there is no worry about its breaking\ndown or whatever. Would you plug in? Would it be wise, from the point\nof your own well-being, to do so? Robert Nozick thinks it would be a\nbig mistake to plug in: ‘We want to do certain things …\nwe want to be a certain way … plugging into an experience\nmachine limits us to a man-made reality’ (Nozick 1974,\np. 43). \n\nOne can make the machine sound more palatable, by allowing that\ngenuine choices can be made on it, that those plugged in have access\nto a common ‘virtual world’ shared by other machine-users,\na world in which ‘ordinary’ communication is possible, and\nso on. But this will not be enough for many anti-hedonists. A further\nline of response begins from so-called ‘externalism’ in the\nphilosophy of mind, according to which the content of mental states\nis determined by facts external to the experiencer of those\nstates. Thus, the experience of really writing a great novel\nis quite different from that of apparently writing a great\nnovel, even though ‘from the inside’ they may be\nindistinguishable. But this is once again sailing close to the\nwind. If the world can affect the very content of my experience\nwithout my being in a position to be aware of it, why should it not directly affect the value of my experience? \n\nThe strongest tack for hedonists to take is to accept the apparent\nforce of the experience machine objection, but to insist that it\nrests on ‘common sense’ intuitions, the place in our lives\nof which may itself be justified by hedonism. This is to adopt a\nstrategy similar to that developed by ‘two-level\nutilitarians’ in response to alleged counter-examples based on\ncommon-sense morality.  The hedonist will point out the so-called\n‘paradox of hedonism’, that pleasure is most effectively\npursued indirectly.  If I consciously try to maximize my own\npleasure, I will be unable to immerse myself in those activities,\nsuch as reading or playing games, which do give pleasure. And if we\nbelieve that those activities are valuable independently of the\npleasure we gain from engaging in them, then we shall probably gain\nmore pleasure overall. \n\nThese kinds of stand-off in moral philosophy are unfortunate, but\nshould not be brushed aside. They raise questions concerning the\nepistemology of ethics, and the source and epistemic status of our\ndeepest ethical beliefs, which we are further from answering than\nmany would like to think. Certainly the current trend of quickly\ndismissing hedonism on the basis of a quick run-through of the\nexperience machine objection is not methodologically sound. \n\nThe experience machine is one motivation for the adoption of a desire\ntheory. When you are on the machine, many of your central desires are\nlikely to remain unfilled. Take your desire to write a great\nnovel. You may believe that this is what you are doing, but in fact\nit is just a hallucination. And what you want, the argument goes, is\nto write a great novel, not the experience of writing a great\nnovel. \n\nHistorically, however, the reason for the current dominance of desire\ntheories lies in the emergence of welfare economics. Pleasure and pain\nare inside people’s heads, and also hard to measure—especially\nwhen we have to start weighing different people’s experiences against\none another. So economists began to see people’s well-being as\nconsisting in the satisfaction of preferences or desires, the content\nof which could be revealed by the choices of their possessors. This made possible the\nranking of preferences, the development of ‘utility\nfunctions’ for individuals, and methods for assessing the value\nof preference-satisfaction (using, for example, money as a\nstandard). \n\nThe simplest version of a desire theory one might call the\npresent desire theory, according to which someone is made\nbetter off to the extent that their current desires are\nfulfilled. This theory does succeed in avoiding the experience\nmachine objection. But it has serious problems of its own. Consider\nthe case of the angry adolescent. This boy’s mother\ntells him he cannot attend a certain nightclub, so the boy holds a\ngun to his own head, wanting to pull the trigger and retaliate\nagainst his mother. Recall that the scope of theories of well-being\nshould be the whole of a life. It is implausible that the boy will\nmake his life go as well as possible by pulling the trigger. We might\nperhaps interpret the simple desire theory as a theory of\nwell-being-at-at-a-particular-time. But even then it seems\nunsatisfactory. From whatever perspective, the boy would be better\noff if he put the gun down. \n\nWe should move, then, to a comprehensive desire theory,\naccording to which what matters to a person’s well-being is the\noverall level of desire-satisfaction in their life as a whole. A\nsummative version of this theory suggests, straightforwardly\nenough, that the more desire-fulfilment in a life the better. But it\nruns into Derek Parfit’s case of addiction (1984, p.\n497). Imagine that you can start taking a highly addictive drug, which\nwill cause a very strong desire in you for the drug every morning.\nTaking the drug will give you no pleasure; but not taking it will\ncause you quite severe suffering. There will be no problem with the\navailability of the drug, and it will cost you nothing. But what\nreason do you have to take it? \n\nA global version of the comprehensive theory ranks desires,\nso that desires about the shape and content of one’s life as a\nwhole are given some priority. So, if I prefer not to become a drug\naddict, that will explain why it is better for me not to take\nParfit’s drug. But now consider the case of the orphan\nmonk. This young man began training to be a monk at the earliest\nage, and has lived a very sheltered life. He is now offered three\nchoices: he can remain as a monk, or become either a cook or a\ngardener outside the monastery, at a grange. He has no conception of\nthe latter alternatives, so chooses to remain a monk. But surely it\nmight be possible that his life would be better for him were he to live\noutside? \n\nSo we now have to move to an informed desire version of the\ncomprehensive theory. According to the informed desire account, the\nbest life is the one I would desire if I were fully informed about\nall the (non-evaluative) facts. But now consider a case suggested by\nJohn Rawls: the grass-counter. Imagine a brilliant Harvard\nmathematician, fully informed about the options available to her, who\ndevelops an overriding desire to count the blades of grass on the\nlawns of Harvard. Like the experience machine, this case is\nanother example of philosophical ‘bedrock’. Some will\nbelieve that, if she really is informed, and not suffering from some\nneurosis, then the life of grass-counting will be the best for\nher. \n\nNote that on the informed desire view the subject must actually have the desires in question for well-being to accrue to her. If it were true of me that, were I fully informed I would desire some object which at present I have no desire for, giving me that object now would not benefit me. Any theory which claimed that it would amounts to an objective list theory with a desire-based epistemology. \n\nAll these problem cases for desire theories appear to be symptoms of a more general difficulty. Recall again the distinction between substantive and formal theories of well-being. The former state the constituents of well-being (such as pleasure), while the\nlatter state what makes these things good for people (pleasantness, for example). Substantively, a desire theorist and a hedonist may agree on what makes life good for people: pleasurable experiences. But formally they will differ: the hedonist will refer\nto pleasantness as the good-maker, while the desire theorist must refer to desire-satisfaction. (It is worth pointing out here that if one characterizes pleasure as an experience the subject wants to continue, the distinction between hedonism and desire theories becomes quite hard to pin down.) \n\nThe idea that desire-satisfaction is a ‘good-making\nproperty’ is somewhat odd. As Aristotle says\n(Metaphysics, 1072a, tr. Ross): ‘desire is consequent\non opinion rather than opinion on desire’. In other words, we\ndesire things, such as writing a great novel, because we think those\nthings are independently good; we do not think they are good because\nthey will satisfy our desire for them. \n\nThe threefold distinction I am using between different theories of\nwell-being has become standard in contemporary ethics. There are\nproblems with it, however, as with many classifications, since it can\nblind one to other ways of characterizing views. Objective list\ntheories are usually understood as theories which list items\nconstituting well-being that consist neither merely in pleasurable\nexperience nor in desire-satisfaction. Such items might include, for\nexample, knowledge or friendship. But it is worth remembering, for\nexample, that hedonism might be seen as one kind of ‘list’\ntheory, and all list theories might then be opposed to desire\ntheories as a whole. \n\nWhat should go on the list? It is important that every good should be\nincluded. As Aristotle put it: ‘We take what is self-sufficient\nto be that which on its own makes life worthy of choice and lacking in\nnothing. We think happiness to be such, and indeed the thing most of\nall worth choosing, not counted as just one thing among others’\n(Nicomachean Ethics, 1197b, tr.  Crisp). In\nother words, if you claim that well-being consists only in friendship\nand pleasure, I can show your list to be unsatisfactory if I can\ndemonstrate that knowledge is also something that makes people better\noff. \n\nWhat is the ‘good-maker’, according to objective list\ntheorists? This depends on the theory. One, influenced by Aristotle\nand recently developed by Thomas Hurka (1993), is\nperfectionism, according to which what makes things\nconstituents of well-being is their perfecting human nature. If it is\npart of human nature to acquire knowledge, for example, then a\nperfectionist should claim that knowledge is a constituent of\nwell-being. But there is nothing to prevent an objective list\ntheorist’s claiming that all that the items on her list have in\ncommon is that each, in its own way, advances well-being. \n\nHow do we decide what goes on the list? All we can work on is the\ndeliverance of reflective judgement—intuition, if you\nlike. But one should not conclude from this that objective list\ntheorists are, because they are intuitionist, less satisfactory than\nthe other two theories. For those theories too can be based only on\nreflective judgement. Nor should one think that intuitionism rules\nout argument.  Argument is one way to bring people to see the\ntruth. Further, we should remember that intuitions can be\nmistaken. Indeed, as suggested above, this is the strongest line of\ndefence available to hedonists: to attempt to undermine the\nevidential weight of many of our natural beliefs about what is good\nfor people. \n\nOne common objection to objective list theories is that they are\nélitist, since they appear to be claiming that certain things\nare good for people, even if those people will not enjoy them, and do\nnot even want them. One strategy here might be to adopt a\n‘hybrid’ account, according to which certain goods do\nbenefit people independently of pleasure and desire-satisfaction, but\nonly when they do in fact bring pleasure and/or satisfy desires.\nAnother would be to bite the bullet, and point out that a theory\ncould be both élitist and true. \n\nIt is also worth pointing out that objective list theories need not\ninvolve any kind of objectionable authoritarianism or perfectionism.\nFirst, one might wish to include autonomy on one’s list,\nclaiming that the informed and reflective living of one’s own\nlife for oneself itself constitutes a good. Second, and perhaps\nmore significantly, one might note that any theory of well-being in\nitself has no direct moral implications. There is nothing logically\nto prevent one’s holding a highly élitist conception of\nwell-being alongside a strict liberal view that forbade paternalistic\ninterference of any kind with a person’s own life (indeed, on\nsome interpretations, J.S. Mill’s position is close to\nthis). \n\n One not implausible view, if desire theories are indeed mistaken in\ntheir reversal of the relation between desire and what is good, is\nthat the debate is really between hedonism and objective list\ntheories. And, as suggested above, what is most at stake here is the\nissue of the epistemic adequacy of our beliefs about well-being. The\nbest way to resolve this matter would consist, in large part at\nleast, in returning once again to the experience machine objection,\nand seeking to discover whether that objection really stands.   \n\nWell-being obviously plays a central role in any moral theory. A\ntheory which said that it just does not matter would be given no\ncredence at all. Indeed, it is very tempting to think that\nwell-being, in some ultimate sense, is all that can matter\nmorally. Consider, for example, Joseph Raz’s ‘humanistic\nprinciple’: ‘the explanation and justification of the\ngoodness or badness of anything derives ultimately from its\ncontribution, actual or possible, to human life and its quality’\n(Raz 1986, p. 194). If we expand this principle to cover non-human\nwell-being, it might be read as claiming that, ultimately speaking,\nthe justificatory force of any moral reason rests on well-being. This\nview is welfarism. \n\nAct-utilitarians, who believe that the right action is that which\nmaximizes well-being overall, may attempt to use the intuitive\nplausibility of welfarism to support their position, arguing that any\ndeviation from the maximization of well-being must be grounded on\nsomething distinct from well-being, such as equality or rights. But\nthose defending equality may argue that egalitarians are concerned to\ngive priority to those who are worse off, and that we do see here a\nlink with concern for well-being. Likewise, those concerned with\nrights may note that we have rights to certain goods, such as freedom,\nor to the absence of ‘bads’, such as suffering (in the\ncase of the right not to be tortured, for example). In other words,\nthe interpretation of welfarism is itself a matter of dispute. But,\nhowever it is understood, it does seem that welfarism poses a problem\nfor those who believe that morality can require actions which benefit\nno one, and harm some, such as, for example, punishments intended to\ngive individuals what they deserve. \n\nAncient ethics was, in a sense, more concerned with well-being than a\ngood deal of modern ethics, the central question for many ancient\nmoral philosophers being, ‘Which life is best for one?’.\nThe rationality of egoism—the view that my strongest reason\nis always to advance my own well-being—was largely\nassumed. This posed a problem. Morality is naturally thought to\nconcern the interests of others. So if egoism is correct, what reason\ndo I have to be moral? \n\nOne obvious strategy to adopt in defence of morality is to claim that\na person’s well-being is in some sense constituted by their\nvirtue, or the exercise of virtue, and this strategy was adopted in\nsubtly different ways by the three greatest ancient philosophers,\nSocrates, Plato, and Aristotle. At one point in his writings, Plato\nappears to allow for the rationality of moral self-sacrifice: the\nphilosophers in his famous ‘cave’ analogy in the\nRepublic (519–20) are required by morality to desist from\ncontemplation of the sun outside the cave, and to descend once again\ninto the cave to govern their fellow citizens. In the voluminous works\nof Aristotle, however, there is no recommendation of sacrifice.\nAristotle believed that he could defend the virtuous choice as always\nbeing in the interest of the individual. Note, however, that he need\nnot be described as an egoist in a strong sense—as someone who\nbelieves that our only reasons for action are grounded in our own\nwell-being. For him, virtue both tends to advance the good of others,\nand (at least when acted on) advances our own good. So Aristotle might\nwell have allowed that the well-being of others grounds reasons for me\nto act. But these reasons will never come into conflict with reasons\ngrounded in my own individual well-being. \n\n His primary argument is the notorious and perfectionist\n‘function argument’, according to which the good for some\nbeing is to be identified through attention to its\n‘function’ or characteristic activity. The characteristic\nactivity of human beings is to exercise reason, and the good will lie\nin exercising reason well—that is, in accordance with the\nvirtues. This argument, which is stated by Aristotle very briefly and\nrelies on assumptions from elsewhere in his philosophy and indeed that\nof Plato, appears to conflate the two ideas of what is good for a\nperson, and what is morally good. I may agree that a\n‘good’ example of humanity will be virtuous, but deny that\nthis person is doing what is best for them. Rather, I may insist,\nreason requires one to advance one’s own good, and this good consists\nin, for example, pleasure, power, or honour. But much of\nAristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics is taken up with portraits of\nthe life of the virtuous and the vicious, which supply independent\nsupport for the claim that well-being is constituted by virtue. In\nparticular, it is worth noting the emphasis placed by Aristotle on the\nvalue to a person of ‘nobility’ (to kalon), a\nquasi-aesthetic value which those sensitive to such qualities might\nnot implausibly see as a constituent of well-being of more worth than\nany other. In this respect, the good of virtue is, in the Kantian\nsense, ‘unconditional’. Yet, for Aristotle, virtue or the\n‘good will’ is not only morally good, but good for the\nindividual.
