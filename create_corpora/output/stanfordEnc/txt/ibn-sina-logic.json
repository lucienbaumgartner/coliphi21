His work is central in the re-definition of a family of\nproblems and doctrines inherited from ancient and late ancient logic,\nespecially Aristotle and the Peripatetic tradition. While, in general\nterms, Avicenna squarely falls into a logical tradition that it is\nreasonable to characterize as Aristotelian, the trove of innovations\nhe introduces establishes him as a genuinely new canonical figure. Every\nlater logician in this tradition confronts him, either as a critic or\nas a follower, to the extent that, with few exceptions, Aristotle and\nthe Peripatetic tradition almost entirely disappear from the\nscene. Arabic logic accordingly divides into two areas and periods:\npre-Avicennan and post-Avicennan (Street\n2004).[1]\n \n\nThe innovations introduced by Avicenna include systematic as well as\ntechnical points: from the division of logic into its main areas to\nthe reading of propositions and the understanding of modality; from a\nnew account of hypothetical propositions to his theory of\ndemonstration.\n\n\nThis entry aims to offer an account of some of the most representative\nfeatures of Avicenna’s logic without any pretense to\nexhaustiveness. A standard classification of the works and contents of\nthe Aristotelian Organon in the Arabic tradition (which\nincludes Porphyry’s Isagoge, alongside\nAristotle’s Rhetoric and Poetics) divides\nthe study of logic broadly into two main areas focusing either on (i)\nformal aspects (e.g., the analysis of the truth conditions of\npropositions, inference, and the structure of arguments) or (ii) on\nmaterial aspects (e.g., the classification of arguments with\nrespect to their terms and premises, which underwrites a standard\ndivision of logic into five areas: demonstration, dialectic,\nsophistic, rhetoric, and poetics). The entry focuses primarily on (i)\nand limits the treatment of (ii) to the case of demonstration and\nfallacies.\n\n\nAvicenna’s logical works consist of a significant amount of\nmaterial unevenly distributed across his various philosophical\nsummae. The most comprehensive treatment of logic is, by far,\nthe one to be found in the monumental treatment of the\nŠifāʾ (The Cure), from the 1020s,\nwhere Avicenna extensively engages in systematic analysis as well as\ninterpretive debate with the Peripatetic tradition. At the opposite\nend of the spectrum is the Išārāt\nwa-tanbīhāt (Pointers and Reminders), the\nshortest and likely the latest (from the 1030s), where Avicenna\norganizes the material in an original way that came to shape the\napproach to logic in the Post-Avicennan tradition. In between (not\nchronologically, as the work largely reflects Avicenna’s early\nviews from around 1014) lies the account of logic developed in the\nNağāt (The Salvation). While offering a\nmuch abridged treatment (and leaving out dialectic, rhetoric, and\npoetics altogether), the latter is methodologically closer to the\nCure than it is to Pointers and Reminders but far\nless ponderous, and offers a good point of access to Avicenna’s\nlogic as a whole. \nIn light of their relative position in the corpus, the balance of\ndetail and perspicuity, and—in the case of the Cure and\nPointers—the relative influence they exerted on the\nlater tradition, I have chosen in this entry to focus almost\nexclusively on these three sources, which also happen to be the ones\nthat are in better shape in terms of available editions. \nOther treatments of logic include the account found in the Dānešnāme-ye ʿAlāʾī (Philosophy for ʿAlāʾ ad-Dawla),\nin Persian, or the one preserved by the partially extant al-Mašriqiyyūn (The Easterners), which reflects an approach no\nlonger committed to the terminology and exegetical problems of the\nAristotelian tradition, written as it is in opposition to the methods\nand doctrines of (Western) Baġdadi Aristotelians (Street 2004). \nFinally, interesting insights on certain areas of logic may also be gleaned from additional heterogeneous sources, such as Avicenna’s correspondence\n(Street 2010a) and texts not directly dealing with\nlogic, most notably the Ilāhiyyāt (especially books\nI and V), which is his major work in metaphysics. \nAvicenna’s logic is indebted first and foremost to\nAristotle—the First Teacher (al-muʿallim al-awwal)—and\nthe works of the Organon: the Categories\n(Maqūlāt), On Interpretation\n(ʿIbāra), the Prior Analytics\n(Anūlūṭīqā ūlā or\nQiyās), the Posterior Analytics\n(Anūlūṭīqā ṯāniya or\nBurhān), the Topics\n(Ṭūbīqā or Ğadal), and the\nSophistical Refutations (Sūfisṭīqā or Muġālaṭa). As noted above, the Arabic\nOrganon included Porphyry’s Isagoge\n(Īsāġūğī or\nMadḫal) as well as Aristotle’s Rhetoric\n(Ḫiṭāba) and Poetics\n(Šiʿr). \nBesides Aristotle, among the figures we encounter in Avicenna’s\nlogical writings—whether identifiable by name, definite\ndescription, or doctrine—are Plato, Theophrastus, Alexander of\nAphrodisias, Galen, Porphyry, Themistius, and Philoponus from the\nGreek tradition; al-Fārābī and other\nBaġdādī Aristotelians from the Arabic tradition (all\nvariously involved in exegetical efforts focusing on the books of the\nOrganon, traces of which survive in the glosses to the\nfamous manuscript Paris BNF, Arabe 2346 that preserves\nits Arabic translation). Their presence varies from the explicit ascription\nof alternative interpretations (e.g., in the case of the\ninterpretation of the absolute proposition) to the rejection of\ncompeting accounts (the contrast between “the widespread\nview” (al-mašhūr) and “the\ntruth” (al-ḥaqq) is a standard device of\nAvicenna’s style of argument); from the tacit adoption of\nsystematic distinctions and concepts (especially with regard to\nal-Fārābī, who is rarely acknowledged) to minute\nexegetical points. \nIn the following, I refer to Avicenna’s works by title, book, chapter, page, and line numbers from the Cairo edition for all\nworks that are part of the Šifāʾ; from Forget’s edition of the\nIšārāt wa-tanbīhāt, and from Dānešpažūh’s\nedition of the Nağāt. \nA standard feature of late ancient Greek commentaries on Aristotle’s individual works\nis to begin with prolegomena dealing with the purpose and\nbenefit of a certain discipline, determining its subject matter and\nrank within the system. Similar issues influence Avicenna’s\napproach to the question of the nature of logic and what it aims to\naccomplish as a discipline. \nLogic is a theoretical discipline that provides the tools and methods\nrequired to avoid error in reasoning, where reasoning means acquiring\nnew knowledge (conceptual or propositional) of what is unknown (mağhūl)\nstarting from what is known (maʿlūm), and to attain the optimal epistemic\nstates legitimately associated with various domains of human\ncognition, most notably certainty (yaqīn) in scientific\ndiscourse (ʿilm) and persuasion\n(iqnāʿ) in dialectic and rhetorical contexts. \nAccordingly, logic has a twofold nature: it is at the same time (i) a\nnormative (literally “canonical”) instrument, according to\nthe definition in Pointers and Reminders, with respect to any other\ndiscipline, and (ii) a part of philosophy, i.e., an Aristotelian\nscience with its own internal structure, which presupposes a\nwell-defined subject. \nIf the purpose and benefit of logic is to lead from what is known to what is unknown, for example from premises to conclusion\nin a valid argument whose premises are asserted, Avicenna’s\naccount of the subject (mawḍūʿ) of logic is\ninextricably tied with a fundamental distinction in Arabic logic,\nwhich can be traced back at least to al-Fārābī, between\nthe two main ways in which knowledge is available to the human mind:\nconception (taṣawwur) and assertion\n(taṣdīq). \nThe distinction between conception and assertion marks the boundary\nbetween the acquisition or possession of individual concepts or\nnotions, and the ascription of truth to statements or judgments. It\nprovides the foundations of Avicenna’s logic (as well as those\nof his epistemology) and determines two distinct modes of knowledge\nlinked on the one hand with (i) concept formation and the domain of\ndefinition (ḥadd) and description (rasm), and\non the other with (ii) truth and reasoning (demonstrative and\nnon-demonstrative syllogism (qiyās), depending on the\nepistemic strength of the assertions involved). \nThe ultimate building-blocks of definitions (directly) and of syllogisms\n(indirectly) are intelligible notions (maʿānin\nmaʿqūla). Logic deals with a special kind of\nintelligible notions, which in the Ilāhiyyāt are\ncharacterized as second-order intelligible notions\n(maʿqulāt ṯāniya)\n(Ilāhiyyāt I.2, 10–11). Assuming that\nfirst-order notions are things like “human”,\n“rational”, “whiteness”, or “stone”,\nsecond-order (or more generally, higher-order) notions are either\ngenuinely distinct concepts such as “subject”,\n“predicate”, “genus”,\n“proposition”, and “syllogism” or, on a weaker\nreading, ways to ascribe second-order properties (such as being a\nuniversal or being a genus and so on) to first-order notions. Logic\ninvestigates the salient properties that hold of second-order notions,\nsuch as the properties of being a genus, the characteristics of\npropositions and their terms, the types of predication\n(essential and accidental), the truth-conditions of propositions, the\nconditions under which arguments are valid and those under which\narguments that seem to be valid are not. On the identification of\nsecondary intelligibles and the subject matter of logic, see (Street 2013) and (Sabra 1980). \nFurthermore, logic entertains two levels of analysis, addressing\ndistinct sets of considerations that are commonly referred to as\nformal and material. Formal characteristics are the quantity and\nquality of a proposition or the arrangement of terms in an argument,\nand in general everything that is necessary and sufficient to proceed\nwithout error in reasoning. \nMaterial aspects of logic involve considerations relative to the types of terms\nused in propositions and arguments and the relations holding among the\nterms. Thus, for instance, the question whether an argument is\ndemonstrative or not is typically a question that concerns not only\nits form (a demonstrative argument must be valid and consist of well-formed\npropositions), but also its matter, namely\nwhether its terms adequately express the right kinds of necessary and\nexplanatory relations. \nThe question what the subject matter of logic is became pressing in later\nArabic logic, as Avicenna’s explicit remarks in the\nIlāhiyyāt were taken to identify too narrow a\nsubject, and conceptions and assertions gained traction as a\nplausible, more general alternative to second-order notions\n(El-Rouayheb 2012). \nOn the relation between logic as an instrument and logic as a science,\nsee Qiyās I.2, Madḫal I.3 and for a\ngeneral discussion (Sabra 1980). \nAvicenna recognizes two basic types of proposition\n(qaḍiyya): (1) categoricals\n(ḥamliyyāt), atomic subject-predicate\npropositions, qualified in various ways; and (2) hypotheticals\n(šarṭiyyāt), molecular propositions\ngoverned by a main connective, which may express a conditional\n(muttaṣil) or a disjunctive (munfaṣil)\nstatement taking as its parts categoricals, hypotheticals, or a\ncombination thereof. \nCategorical propositions are subject\n(mawḍūʿ)-predicate\n(maḥmūl) propositions expressing a relation\n(nisba) or judgment (ḥukm) between terms. They\nare usually classified according to a number of distinctions and\nreadings. \nThis yields an eight-fold categorization occasionally advocated by\nAvicenna himself when he says, for example in the treatment of\nhypothetical propositions, that the categoricals embedded in\nthem may be one of the above eight (Qiyās VII.1, 361.1–362.4). \nAvicenna may be credited with one of the most significant reforms in\nthe analysis of propositional forms in the Peripatetic tradition. His\nnew catalog of subject-predicate propositions, their relations of\ncontradiction, subalternation, and conversion, became the center of\ngravity of an established tradition of logic. \nAvicenna introduces two radical innovations in the Aristotelian\nanalysis of propositions. \nThe two parameters jointly yield a variety of types of modalized\npropositions, a canonical list of which becomes standard in the\nthirteenth century. Below are some notable items that can be found in\nvarious forms in Avicenna’s works and which crystallized starting\nwith Rāzī (Street 2013; cf. Strobino & Thom\n 2016).[4]\n The deeper syntax of these propositions is a subject of dispute\n(Hodges 2015).  Temporal  Alethic Mixed Alethic and Temporal \nFor a full list of instances of a-, e-, i-, and o-propositions see\n appendix A. \nHypotheticals comprise two main sub-types, depending on whether the\ncomponent sentences are in connection (ittiṣāl) or\nin conflict (ʿinād). In the first case, the\nconnection is analyzed in terms of a relation of following\n(ittibāʿ) between an antecedent (muqaddam)\nand a consequent\n (tālin).[5]\n In the second case, conflict is expressed in terms of a disjunction\nof propositions (or parts, ağzāʾ). \nThe resulting propositional types are conditionals\n(muttaṣilāt) and disjunctions\n(munfaṣilāt). Avicenna investigates them both with\nrespect to basic logical relations—such as contradiction,\nsubalternation, mutual implication, or conversion—and within the context of\nsyllogistic inferences. \nA distinctive feature of Avicenna’s analysis of hypothetical\npropositions is quantification. The conditional relation between\nantecedent and consequent as well as the relation of conflict between\nthe parts of a disjunction are embedded within the scope of a\nquantifier which may express a universal affirmative, a universal\nnegative, a particular affirmative, or a particular negative\nhypothetical proposition. \nThe question with respect to what conditional and disjunctive\nstatements are quantified may elicit different answers. In the case of\nconditional statements, Avicenna indicates that the quantification\nshould be understood to apply to the times at which the antecedent is\nposited and the states or conditions (in short, additional\nassumptions) that can be associated with it. The problem is addressed\nfor example by (Rescher 1963b), (Movahed 2009), and (Hodges 2013). A\nuniversal affirmative conditional statement is true when the\nconsequent follows the antecedent at all times the antecedent is\nposited and with respect to all states that may legitimately be added\nto the\n antecedent:[6] \nIf the connection (ittiṣāl) is asserted under any\ncondition and circumstance (ʿalā kull\ništirāṭ wa-waḍʿ) [at which the\nantecedent] is posited, then the hypothetical conditional proposition\nis universal; (Qiyās V.4, 263.1–264.2)  \nIn the statement “Always, if C is B, then H is Z” the\nwords “always, if” are not only meant to cover what is\n[explicitly] intended (al-murād) [by this proposition],\nin such a way that it is as if one were to say “Every time at\nwhich C is B, H is Z”. Rather, [the words “always,\nif”] are also meant to cover every state\n(ḥāl) which may be added to the statement\n“Every C is B”, in such a way that there is no state\n(ḥāl) or condition (šarṭ)\nwhatsoever that makes C to be B without making H to be Z, when it is\nadded to [the antecedent “C is B”]. (Qiyās, V.4, 265.1–5)[7] \nA classification of hypothetical propositions is given at the\nbeginning of Qiyās V.3, where Avicenna explicitly lists\na first set of permutations and illustrates them with examples. There\nseems to be no principled reason to think that Avicenna would not have\nentertained the possibility of more complex iterations (where, for\ninstance, the antecedent of a conditional is itself a conditional\nwhose antecedent is a disjunction of conditionals whose consequents\nare conditionals consisting of categoricals). A hint in this direction\nis that he is prepared to entertain the notion of potentially infinite\ndisjunctions. \nAvicenna considers the following types of hypothetical propositions in\nQiyās V.3: \nThe first type comprises the most basic kind of hypothetical\npropositions, which take categorical propositions as their parts. The\nhypotheticals discussed in the development of the hypothetical\nsyllogistic in Qiyās VI are of type (i) only. That is to\nsay, the premise-pairs of hypothetical syllogisms are either type-(i)\npropositions (conditional-conditional; conditional-disjunctive;\ndisjunctive-disjunctive); or combinations of type (i) propositions\nwith categoricals (conditional-categorical; disjunctive-categorical).\nThe former class comprises purely hypothetical syllogisms, the latter\nmixed hypothetical syllogisms. \nAvicenna illustrates the above types by means of the following\nexamples (Qiyās V.3, 253.1–255.2): \nConditionals express relations of following between an antecedent and\na consequent. Complete conditionals are bi-conditionals. \nAvicenna distinguishes between two types of conditionals: implicative\n(luzūmī) and coincidental\n(ittifāqī). While the former express\nnecessary relations of following whereby the consequent follows\nbecause or in virtue of the antecedent, the latter have often been\nthought to express an accidental connection, though it seems plausible\nthat Avicenna might simply mean agreement or coincidence\nin truth or in being the\n case together (maʿiyya).[8]\n When a conditional expresses an implication (luzūm), it\nis called real (ḥaqīqī or ʿalā\nt-taḥqīq); when it expresses coincidence\n(ittifāq, muwāfaqa or\ntawāfuq), it is called unqualified (muṭlaq\nor ʿalā l-iṭlāq). For a characterization\nof conditionals see (Karimullah 2014a). \nAvicenna distinguishes among three types of disjunctive statements:\n(i) exclusive and exhaustive; (ii) exclusive non-exhaustive; (iii)\ninclusive. Put simply, their characteristic properties may be expressed in terms of the\nfollowing three relations: \nAvicenna refers to the first type as the real (or genuine) disjunction\n(munfaṣila ḥaqīqiyya) and to the other two\ntypes as unreal (ġayr ḥaqīqī)\ndisjunctions. The second and third type were canonically referred to\nby Post-Avicennan logicians as the māniʿat\nal-ğamʿ disjunction (preventing the joint affirmation\nof the two disjuncts, i.e., compatible with their both being false\ntogether but incompatible with their both being true together) and the\nmāniʿat al-ḫuluww disjunction (preventing the\njoint negation of the two disjuncts, i.e., compatible with their both\nbeing true together but incompatible with their both being false\ntogether) (El-Rouayheb 2010). \nNegative disjunctions express absence of conflict or\nincompatibility. \nImplicative conditionals are true (1.1) when the antecedent and the\nconsequent are both true or (1.2) when the antecedent is false and the\nconsequent is true or (1.3) when the antecedent and the consequent are\nboth false, and (2) there is a connection of meaning between the two\nsuch that the consequent is inseparable from the antecedent. \nCoincidental conditionals are true when the antecedent and the\nconsequent are both true or when the antecedent is false and the\nconsequent is true (but false when both the antecedent and the\nconsequent are false). \nBoth conditionals are false when the antecedent is true and the\nconsequent is false. Implicative conditionals with true antecedents\nand consequents are also true as coincidental. The question how the\ntwo are related more generally and without such restrictions is in\nneed of further investigation. \nNegative universal (particular) conditionals express the fact the consequent does not necessarily follow from the antecedent (luzūmī) or is not true together with the antecedent (ittifāqī) at any (some) times and under any (some) circumstances. They are equivalent to affirmative conditionals of the\nsame quantity with a contradictory consequent and express the dual\nrelation of dependency (or togetherness) of the contradictory of the consequent with respect to the\nantecedent at all (some) times and under all (some) circumstances. For\nexample, a universal negative conditional of the form “Never, if\nA is B, then C is D” is logically equivalent to “Always,\nif A is B, then C is not D”. Negative conditional statements may\nexpress absence of a luzūmī connection (as in\n“Never, if man exists, then void does not exist”) or\nabsence of an ittifāqī connection (as in\n“Never, if man exists, then void exists”)\n(Qiyās V.5, 279.1–283.9). \nAvicenna is keenly interested in conditionals with impossible\nantecedents (sophisticated discussions are to be found in his account\nof a- and e-conditionals and in connection with reductio\narguments) but only in the sense in which an impossibility may genuinely be derived from another impossibility, as it were, out of the meaning of the terms involved,\nnot in the sense in which an arbitrary consequent may trivially be inferred from\nan impossible antecedent. The problem of explosion is recognized and\nrejected in post-Avicennan logic, starting with\nḪūnağī (d. 1248 CE). It seems reasonable to assume, even in\nthe current state of our fragmentary knowledge of such a vast amount of material,\nthat both Avicenna’s logic and post-Avicennan logic may\ngenerally be committed to an idea of logical consequence that could perhaps\nbest be captured, in modern terms, by the intuition behind a\nrelevantist approach to the notion of following. This is\na feature that the Arabic tradition would share with certain strands\nof medieval Latin logic. In discussing the problem of conditionals\nwith impossible antecedents in the post-Avicennan tradition\n(El-Rouayheb 2009 and 2010: xxxiii–xl) argues for an even stronger\ninterpretation in terms of connexive\n logic.[9] \nContradiction (tanāquḍ) and conversion\n(ʿaks) are fundamental relations in Avicenna’s\nlogic. The principles that govern them are central in the development\nof the syllogistic, both categorical and hypothetical. It is not\nsurprising, in light of the complexity of Avicenna’s analysis of\ncategorical propositions and of his elaborate account of quantified\nhypotheticals, that his answers to questions such as what contradicts\nwhat, what follows from what, and what converts with what all\ncame under close scrutiny in Post-Avicennan logic, before finding a\nstable equilibrium with Kātibī (d. 1276 CE), an equilibrium that turns\nin several key respects on the interpretation of these relations. \nThe logical relations usually expressed in the Aristotelian square of\nopposition for assertoric propositions and its modal counterparts\nbecome the object of a significant revision in Avicenna’s\nsystem, as a result of the richer set of propositions it comprises.\nPerhaps the most striking feature is the replacement of the\nAristotelian assertoric with the one-sided absolute (X1),\na proposition containing an\nimplicit temporal modality (“sometimes” or “at least\nonce”) which, unlike the Aristotelian assertoric, is not\ncontradicted by a proposition of the same kind, but by a stronger\nproposition, namely the “perpetual”\n(dāʾima) A-proposition. \nBelow is a summary of the relations of entailment (including subalternation) and contradiction for four basic types of propositions, all one-sided, in\nthe referential/substantial reading; in the case of two-sided propositions,\ncontradictories are disjunctive statements or involve a disjunctive\npredicate (the latter only applies to two-sided possibility propositions): \nFigure 1: Referential/substantial necessity,\nperpetuity, general absoluteness, and general possibility:\nentailment and contradiction \nThe following are analogous relations among propositions in the\ndescriptional reading: \nFigure 2: Descriptional necessity,\nperpetuity, general absoluteness, and general possibility:\nentailment and contradiction  \nThe above relations are central in syllogistic proofs by\nreductio. \nIn the case of hypothetical propositions, contradiction is determined\nonly with respect to the main quantifier of the conditional or the\ndisjunction and does not affect the component statements. In other\nwords, it should not be confused with another relation involving\nnegation, namely mutual implication (talāzum). The\ncontradictory of a conditional a-proposition is a conditional\no-proposition with the same antecedent and consequent and the\ncontradictory of a conditional e-proposition is a conditional\ni-proposition with the same antecedent and consequent. The same\napplies to the case of disjunctions. \nAvicenna is keen to point out on various occasions throughout the\ntreatment of conditionals in the Qiyās that what matters\nare the quantificational aspects of the relation between\nantecedent and consequent (the nisba or the\nḥukm), not the quantity and quality of the antecedent\nand consequent themselves. In particular, he vigorously rejects the\nview that the contradictory of a conditional statement is a\nconditional statement of the same quality and quantity whose\nconsequent is denied. In his view, the contradictory of (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa is\n (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa, not (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ao. In other words, “Always, if every A is B,\nthen every C is D” is contradicted by “Not always, if every A is\nB, then every C is D” and not by “Always, if every A is B, then not every C is D” which is in fact a stronger statement equivalent to its contrary, namely  (e-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa (“Never, if every A is B, then every C is D”).[10]\nOn the other hand, (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa is logically equivalent to (i-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ao\n(“Sometimes, if every A is B, then not every C is D”),\nwhich is therefore another contradictory of (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa. A set of basic relations is represented in the\nfollowing diagram \nFigure 3: Relations among conditionals: mutual implication, subalternation, contrariety, and contradiction)  \n(Some of) the rules of conversion for categorical propositions\nconstitute another major departure from Aristotle. On Avicenna’s\nmodel, the absolute universal negative proposition, X1-e,\nfails to convert due to its being\na one-sided temporal proposition (in general it is not true that if no\nA is always B, then no B is always A, as in “No animal always\nsleeps” and “Nothing that sleeps is always an\nanimal”). L-a and L-i\npropositions do not convert as L-i\npropositions but rather as M1-i\npropositions (for a general\npresentation and an account of the proofs see Street 2002, Thom 2003).\nL-e and Ld1-e\npropositions convert as such. In\nthe first case, the proof is one of the most controversial points in\nAvicenna’s system, directly connected with the validity of\nfirst-figure syllogisms with a one-sided possibility, M1,\nminor premise. The conversion of\nLd1-propositions as Ld1-propositions is in fact the minimal\nessential requirement for the productivity of second-figure moods\ninvolving absolutes in XX and XM mixes. For Avicenna’s account of why an Ld1-proposition\nmay legitimately be regarded as an\nabsolute proposition, see Qiyās I.4 and Burhān II.1, discussed in (Strobino\nforthcoming). \nThe conversion of hypothetical propositions is explicitly discussed\nonly in a short chapter of the Qiyās (VII.3), where\nAvicenna briefly talks about the status of (e-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)) propositions\n(conversion does not apply in a genuine sense to disjunctions, whose parts are equivalent: “Always, either every A is B or C is\nD” is the same statement as “Always, either every C is D\nor every A is B”). This, however, should not suggest that\nconversion is less important in the case of hypotheticals than it is\nin the case of categoricals: it is in fact an essential method of proof for\ncertain hypothetical syllogisms. Additional rules may be extrapolated from the\nextensive discussions of syllogisms involving conditionals in\nQiyās VI.1, VI.2, and VI.4. \nIn the conversion of conditional propositions, the parameters that matter are the\nquantity of the proposition to be converted and that of its\nconverse, and the type of conditional (luzūmī or\nittifāqī), while the antecedent and the consequent are\ntreated in a way analogous to the way in which terms are treated in\nthe conversion of categoricals. The following are notable as well as\nfrequently used conversion principles: \nThe analysis of inferential relations among hypotheticals includes the\nmutual implication (talāzum) of (i) conditional\nstatements and (ii) disjunctive statements, as well as (iii) the interaction\nbetween the two classes of hypotheticals. Besides its intrinsic interest, such an analysis is\noften required for the proof validity of hypothetical syllogisms, in addition\nto standard techniques such as conversion, ecthesis\n(iftirāḍ), and reductio. The treatment of\nconditionals is found in Qiyās VII.1, while\nQiyās VII.2 is devoted to the analysis of disjunctions\nand the connection between the two. \nIn Qiyās VII.1, Avicenna considers a basic set of\nquantified conditional statements with quantified antecedents and\nconsequents. Assuming the four basic forms of quantified conditional\nstatements (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)), (e-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)), (i-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)), and (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)) and all permutations of a-,\ne-, i-, o-propositions as antecedents and consequents, Avicenna\ngenerates four groups of sixteen conditional propositions (see\n Appendix B)\n and argues that any of those forms is logically equivalent to the\ncontradictory conditional with a contradictory consequent, based on a\nreductio proof that may easily be generalized. As\nillustrated above (contradiction of conditional propositions), the\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa proposition is for instance equivalent to the (e-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ao\nproposition (“Always, if every A is B, then every C is D”\nif and only if “Never, if every A is B, then not every C is\nD”). If that were not the case, then (i-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ao would be true. But\nthen (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa would be true, which contradicts the initial assumption.\nFor an account of Avicenna’s reductio proof of the fact\nthat “Always, if every A is B, then every C is D” implies\n“Never, if every A is B, then not every C is D”—at\nQiyās 367.11–368.1—see (El-Rouayheb 2009:\n209–210 and 2010:\n xxxiii–xxxiv).[11] \nThe scheme of classification of disjunctive propositions is analogous\nto that of conditionals. Disjunctive statements consisting of two\nparts are quantified as a-, e-, i-, and o-propositions (where negative\npropositions express absence of conflict or incompatibility between\nthe disjuncts at all (some) times and under all (some) circumstances)\nwith sixteen permutations for each case depending on the quality and\nquantity of the parts (see\n Appendix B).\nIn this case, however, the situation is complicated by the fact that\ndifferent types of disjunctions have different logical properties,\nwith specific considerations applying to each type. Besides, in the\nschematic representations offered below, I prefer to retain the\nquantificational features of the disjuncts, as Avicenna seems to\ndifferentiate explicitly between real and unreal disjunctions in\nvirtue, among other things, of their having affirmative or negative\nparts, another point that deserves more attention (for a preliminary\nanalysis see Street 1995). In general, for Avicenna disjunctions and\nconditionals are not inter-definable without qualification. \nAvicenna addresses the relation between disjunctions and conditionals\nfirst. The main distinction is between the case in which the\ndisjunction is (i) real (exclusive and exhaustive) and the case in\nwhich it is (ii) unreal (to be taken here in the sense of inclusive).[12] \nIn case (i), the negation of a disjunct implies the affirmation of the other disjunct and the affirmation of a disjunct implies the negation of the other disjunct. In case (ii), the negation of a disjunct implies the affirmation of the other disjunct, but the affirmation of a disjunct does not imply the negation of the other disjunct. Thus, for instance the following\nrelations hold, as instances of the schemata \\((\\aD^1)pq \\rightarrow\n(\\aC)\\neg pq\\) and \\((\\aD^1)pq \\rightarrow (\\aC)p\\neg q\\): \nBy contrast, if the disjunction is unreal (inclusive), only the\nfollowing relations hold: \nIn analogy with the case of conditionals, Avicenna also discusses\ninferential relations among disjunctions (Qiyās VII.2,\n379.17–381.10), where notable cases are, for real affirmative\ndisjunctions with affirmative parts: \nThus, an exclusive and exhaustive universal affirmative disjunction\nentails a proposition that expresses universal absence of conflict\nbetween one of the disjuncts and the contradictory of the other\n(“from ‘Always either every A is B or every C is D’\none can infer ‘Never either not every A is B or every C is\nD’ and ‘Never either not every C is D or every A is\nB’”, Qiyās VII.2, 380.1–4). The converse is\nnot generally true, as the negative disjunction may be true in virtue of\nan impossible disjunct that is not in conflict with the other\n(according to the semantics of negative disjunctions discussed in\nQiyās V.5). The same holds for (i-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\)1) and\n(o-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\)1) propositions. \nThe relations among disjunctions and conditionals, a theme of obvious\ninterest from the standpoint of modern logic, reflect the complexity\nof the above distinctions. Avicenna investigates relations such as,\nfor instance, the triangulation between (a-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\)),\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)), and (e-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\)) propositions\n(Qiyās VII.2, 381.11–17): \nThis is only an example of a more complex network of inferential\nrelations that should be complemented with an exhaustive list and an\naccurate analysis of the inferences used in the treatment of\nsyllogisms, especially in Qiyās VI. \nThe culmination of Avicenna’s formal logic is the development of\nan elaborate theory of the syllogism that brings together various\nstrands from ancient and late ancient logic, filtered through\nPeripatetic lenses, and produces a new and original system. \nThe theory of the syllogism (qiyās), in its main\ndivisions, occupies a prominent part in all of Avicenna’s\nlogical works. The doctrinal skeleton remains the same in spite of a\nsignificant re-arrangement of the material, especially in the\nIšārāt. In the works of the middle period,\nespecially the Nağāt and the extensive treatment of the\nQiyās, Avicenna follows the path charted by the\nPrior\n Analytics.[13] \nAmong the several innovations Avicenna may be credited with is the\ncodification of a canonical division, echoing distinctions already\nbrewing in ancient and late ancient logic, of syllogisms in a number\nof categories that became standard conceptual vocabulary in later\nArabic logic. \nSyllogisms divide into two main types: (1) connective syllogisms\n(iqtirānī) and (2) repetitive syllogisms\n(istiṯnāʾī). \nConnective syllogisms are defined as those in which neither the\nconclusion nor its contradictory is explicitly part of the premises,\nand hence as those syllogisms in which the conclusion is only\npotentially contained in the premises. Connective syllogisms are\ncharacterized by a partial overlap or sharing between the premises (of\na middle term or of a proposition discharged in the conclusion). \nRepetitive syllogisms are defined as those in which either the\nconclusion or its contradictory is explicitly part of the\npremises. \nFurther discussion of syllogistic arguments include the (i) compound\nsyllogism (qiyās murakkab), which involves multiple\nsyllogisms such that the conclusion of a syllogism serves as a premise for\nthe next syllogism, whether by an explicit concatenation\n(mawṣūl) or an implicit one\n(mufaṣṣal), as well as other forms that came to\nbe discussed, in later Arabic logic, under the rubric of concomitants\nof the syllogism (lawāḥiq al-qiyās). These\nvariously connect to chapters of the Prior Analytics and include:\n(ii) the proof through the impossible or reductio ad absurdum\n(qiyās al-ḫalf or kalām ilā\nl-muḥāl), which in Avicenna is interestingly\nanalyzed in terms of a combination of a connective and a repetitive\nsyllogism, (iii) the conversion of the syllogism (ʿaks\nal-qiyās), (iv) the syllogism from opposites (qiyāsāt muʾallafa min muqaddamāt mutāqabila), and (v)\ncircular proof (bayān ad-dawr). \nConnective syllogisms are divided into two main types: (1) categorical\n(ḥamlī) and (2) hypothetical\n(šarṭī) syllogisms. \n(1) Categorical syllogisms are those whose premises and conclusions\nare all and only categorical propositions. Their treatment constitutes\none of Avicenna’s most original contributions. It follows paths\nand adopts techniques that are familiar in the Aristotelian tradition\nbut the resulting system is original and based on distinctive\nintuitions, largely due to the sophisticated understanding of modality\nthat emerges in the analysis of propositions. \n(2) The hypothetical syllogistic is a new development, at least with\nrespect to Aristotle. Although the model is likely indebted to late\nancient Greek sources, the genuinely innovative character of its\nconstituent elements (quantified hypothetical propositions) turns this\narea into something rather different from its most natural Greek\n(Galen) or Latin (most notably Boethius) terms of comparison, even\nleaving aside other differences. \nThe hypothetical syllogistic investigates arguments in which at least one\nof the premises is a hypothetical proposition (of type (i), namely one\nwhose parts are themselves categoricals, though Avicenna does not seem\nto put any restriction on more complex argument forms). Purely hypothetical\nsyllogisms are those in which the combination of the premises involve\nonly hypotheticals (conditional-conditional;\nconditional-disjunction; disjunction-disjunction). Mixed hypothetical\nsyllogisms are those in which the combination of the premises involves\na hypothetical (conditional or disjunction) and a categorical. \nThe extent to which hypothetical syllogisms are treated in\nAvicenna’s various logical works varies significantly. A great\ndeal of material is left out of the abridged treatments (for instance\nin the Nağāt and in the Išārāt)\ncompared to the extensive analysis provided in the Qiyās\n(and to that promised but never delivered—as far as we\nknow—in the frequently announced Kitāb\nal-Lawāḥiq, the Book of the Appendices). The\ncriteria of selection are not just pragmatic (hypothetical syllogisms\nare significantly more complex, if only in virtue of the compounding\neffect generated by an additional layer of quantification) but also\nbased on the idea that some combinations are more natural (perhaps\nmore intuitive) than others. \nThe entire edifice of Avicenna’s connective syllogistic rests on the assumption that certain argument forms are self-evidently productive\n(bayyina, bayyina bi-anfusihā, bayyinat\nal-intāğ) or perfect (kāmila) and that all\nother forms can be reduced (ruğūʿ) to them by\nstandard methods of proof. The latter include (i) proofs based on\nconversion (ʿaks) (alongside other kinds of\ntransformation of premises or conclusions into logically equivalent premises or\nconclusions, in the case of hypothetical syllogisms), (ii) proofs\nbased on setting out a term (iftirāḍ)—the\ncounterpart of the Aristotelian notion of ecthesis, and (iii) proofs\nthrough the impossible (or reductio ad absurdum,\nqiyās al-ḫalf). Depending on the circumstances,\none, two or all three methods may be used to prove productivity. \nCategorical syllogisms are argument forms consisting of triplets of\nterms (ḥudūd) arranged in two premises\n(muqaddamāt) and a conclusion (natīğa\nor, insofar as it is implicitly contained in or aimed at by the premises,\nmaṭlūb). The two premises share a term with one\nanother and one each with the conclusion, for example, “Every B\nis C; every A is B; therefore every A is C” (BaC,\nAaB ⊢ AaC). The term shared by the premises is\ncalled middle term (ḥadd awsaṭ). The subject of\nthe conclusion is called minor term (ḥadd\naṣġar), the predicate of the conclusion is called\nmajor term (ḥadd akbar). The premise that shares with\nthe conclusion the minor term is called minor premise (muqaddama\nṣuġrā). The premise that shares with the\nconclusion the major term is called major premise (muqaddama\nkubrā). \nThe middle term may be (i) subject of the major premise and predicate\nof the minor premise; (ii) predicate of both; or (iii) subject of\nboth. The resulting configurations are called (i) first figure\n(šakl awwal), (ii) second figure (šakl\nṯānin), and (iii) third figure (šakl\nṯāliṯ). Like Aristotle, Avicenna does not\ncontemplate a fourth\n figure.[14]\n Each figure contains a number of valid moods\n(ḍurūb), identified by the quantity, quality, and\nmodality of the premises and conclusion. For the sake of simplicity, I\nuse standard vocabulary for the treatment of the Aristotelian syllogistic\n(in particular the list of mnemonic tags developed in the Latin middle\nages for the identification of\n moods).[15]\n The moods of the first figure are Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio.\nThe moods of the second figure are Cesare, Camestres, Festino, Baroco.\nThe moods of the third figure are Darapti, Felapton, Datisi, Disamis,\nBocardo, and Ferison. Each of the above will be productive with\ncertain combinations of modalized premises and not with others. \nThe discussion of productive moods in the Qiyās and in the\nNağāt follows the order and method of presentation\nof the Prior Analytics and focuses on different modal mixes\n(iḫtilāṭāt) that are then distinguished\nby figure (for example, the LX or the LM combinations in the first,\nsecond, and third figure). In the Išārāt\nAvicenna chooses a different approach and discusses productivity by\nfigure, not by mix. This enables him to present more effectively a\nnumber of general principles governing inferences in each figure, and\nmost importantly modifications to the so-called rule of the major for\nthe first figure (Street forthcoming). The rule of the major tells us\nthat the modality of the conclusion in first-figure syllogisms follows\nthe modality of the major premise, except in two cases that will be\ndiscussed below (Ld1LL and XMM).  Given the logical\npriority ascribed by Avicenna to the first figure, this move\nrepresents a significant gain in terms of simplicity. \nBelow is a schematic summary of the productive combinations of\nmodalized premises in each figure (the combinations in square brackets\nare productive but not always explicitly identified by Avicenna). \nIn the first figure, according to the terse account offered in the\nIšārāt, if the minor premise is an actuality\nproposition (X\nor L), the conclusion follows the modality\nof the major (X, L\nor M). There are, however, two exceptions in\nwhich the conclusion follows the modality of the minor premise. The\nfirst exception is Ld1LL, where the major is a\ndescriptional necessity proposition and the conclusion, like the\nminor, is an L-proposition (stronger than\nthe major). The second exception is XMM, where the major is an\nabsolute proposition and the conclusion, like the minor, is\nan M-proposition proposition (weaker than\nthe major). In the remaining two cases in which the minor is\nan M-proposition, namely MMM and LML, the\nrule of the major applies. \nMMM and MLM moods in the first figure are perfect (Qiyās\nIV.1, 181.2–4, 184.3–6, and IV.3, 199.5–6, where the\nlatter are explicitly characterized as instances of the maqūl\nʿalā l-kull or dictum de omni). LML moods, by\ncontrast, require proof. \nSome of the most interesting (and problematic) aspects of\nAvicenna’s modal logic emerge in connection with the proofs used\nto establish the productivity of certain notable moods.  For instance,\nthe controversial idea that the possible may be assumed to be actual\nin the context of a reductio proof (as well as in the proof\nof e-conversion of necessity propositions) is justified by intuitions\nthat have sparked heated controversies in the post-Avicennan tradition\n(similar issues arise in the Greek tradition; for a philosophical\ninterpretation of this technique, see Malink & Rosen\n2013). Another problem is the potential circularity of the proof of\nBarbara LML, which, even if we leave aside the issue of assuming the\npossible to be actual, seems to rest on Baroco LXL, which in turn\ndepends on Barbara LML (Street 2002). \nA crucial intuition that lies at the core of Avicenna’s\nunderstanding of modality is connected with the different readings\nintroduced above (referential/substantial and descriptional). If a\nproperty holds necessarily of something (picked out by the middle\nterm) under the referential/substantial reading, then it also\nnecessarily holds of whatever the middle term may be true of:  \nIn sum, be aware of the fact that that for which it is possible to be\nnecessary is always necessary (mā yumkinu an\nyaṣīra ḍarūriyyan fa-huwa ḍarūriyyun\ndāʾiman) and that it may [also] be possible in the more\ngeneral sense (wa-amkanahū l-imkān\nal-aʿāmm). (Qiyās IV.3, 203.4–5)\n \nA similar line of reasoning applies to the case of LXL moods\n(Qiyās IV.3, 202, Nağāt 71) and,\nmutatis mutandis, to Ld1LL\nmoods with regard to the minor\npremise. \nAvicenna explicitly formulates a generalized modal version of the\ndictum de omni at Qiyās IV.1, 184.3–5:\n \nWhat possibly holds of what possibly holds [of something] possibly\nholds of [that something] in an evident way (mumkin al-mumkin\nmumkin ẓāhir al-imkān), just as what necessarily\nholds of what necessarily holds [of something] necessarily holds [of\nthat something] (ḍarūrī\naḍ-ḍarūrī ḍarūrī) and what\nholds of what holds [of something] holds of [that something]\n(mawğūd [for wuğūd] al-mawğūd\nmawğūd). \nPerhaps the most striking feature of Avicenna’s system is the\nproductivity (and foundational role) of first-figure syllogisms with a\npossibility minor premise, which has traditionally been regarded as\nproblematic by many of Avicenna’s commentators.  The case in\nsupport of this view hinges primarily on a certain reading of the\nterms and the idea that possibility propositions express relations of\ncompatibility (or separability) among conceptions or essences, which\nAvicenna often spells out in terms of natures (of the subject and\npredicate) (Thom 2008, 2012). \nA noteworthy property of the second figure is that as a result of\nAvicenna’s replacement of the Aristotelian assertoric with his\nown general absolute, there are, strictly speaking, no\nproductive moods out of two absolute premises, due to their failure to\nconvert as themselves (Street 2002). Avicenna, however, is committed\nto the productivity of the familiar four moods in the second figure\nwhen the absolute is taken in a qualified sense, according to which it\nconverts as itself, namely when it is at least as strong as\nan Ld1-proposition (the same\napplies to second-figure XM moods). Avicenna consistently discusses\nthis essential requirement in his logical works, often in conjunction\nwith the claim that this qualified reading is the default sense of the\ne-proposition as well as being the one adopted in the sciences\n(Strobino forthcoming). \nAn account of Avicenna’s modal syllogistic influenced by\nconsiderations of this sort and aiming to look at its logical\nproperties in tandem with Avicenna’s metaphysics has been\nrecently offered by (Thom 2012). The project is inspired by principles\nthat are similar to those underpinning the most significant recent\ndevelopments in the interpretation of Aristotle’s modal\nsyllogistic (Malink 2013). A model that stresses the two-dimensional\ncharacter of Avicenna’s logic and reads Avicenna as reducing\nalethic modalities to temporal modalities only has been proposed by\n(Hodges and Johnston 2017). \nThe hypothetical propositions discussed above may be used as premises\nand conclusions of syllogistic arguments. \nAvicenna investigates five main types of hypothetical syllogisms (with\nfurther internal divisions). The first three are combinations of two\nconditional premises (type 1), a conditional premise and a disjunctive\npremise (type 2), or two disjunctive premises (type 3), and are called\npure (ṣirfa) hypothetical syllogisms. The last two are\ncombinations of a conditional and a categorical premise (type 4,\nsubdivided into two classes), or of a disjunctive and a categorical\npremise (type 5), and are called mixed\n(muḫtalaṭa) hypothetical\n syllogisms.[16] \nIn general, there are some structural features that need to be kept in\nmind, while looking at this part of Avicenna’s logic.\nHypothetical syllogisms are connective (iqtirānī) syllogisms\nand, as we have seen above, this means by definition that the premises\nare connected by a shared element. The latter may be either (i) a term\n(types 4 and 5, where the sharing occurs between a term in the\ncategorical premise and a term in one of the constituent propositions of the\nhypothetical (conditional or disjunctive) premise) or (ii) a proposition (types 1, 2,\nand 3). In certain cases, the arrangement is such that it is possible to identify\nthree figures in a way analogous to categorical\nsyllogisms, whether the shared part is a term (types 4 and 5 again) or\na proposition (type 1). In other cases, no such partition emerges,\nespecially in the absence of an intrinsic order of the parts (type 3). \nAnother standard feature of Avicenna’s discussion, especially\nwhere premises are of different kinds (type 2, 4, and 5), is that\narguments are classified in function of (i) which premise is major and\nwhich is minor; (ii) what part is shared (for conditionals, whether it\nis part of the antecedent or of the consequent; for disjunctions, whether\nthe disjunction is real or unreal, and whether the shared part is\naffirmative or negative). \nOn several occasions—most notably but not exclusively in the\ncontext of the abridged treatments—Avicenna simplifies the\nanalysis and avoids a detailed discussion of individual productive\nmoods by providing general criteria for productivity, determined\naccording to these different parameters. Again, this approach is\nstructurally similar to the one adopted in the treatment of the categorical syllogistic but the complexity\nis higher due to additional variables at play with hypotheticals. It\nis worth noting that in Post-Avicennan logic, starting in particular\nwith Ḫūnağī, considerable attention is paid to\nthis part of Avicenna’s system, and the discovery of additional\nmoods as well as the rejection of moods accepted by Avicenna were\noften associated with a critique and revision of these criteria\n(El-Rouayheb 2010). \nIn hypothetical syllogisms with two conditional premises, the shared\npart is a proposition which plays the same role as the middle term in\ncategorical syllogisms. Depending on whether it is (i) the consequent\nof the major premise and the antecedent of the minor, (ii) the\nconsequent of both or (iii) the antecedent of both, arguments of this\nkind will fall into one of the three familiar figures. The moods in\neach figure are determined here in function of the quality and\nquantity of the conditional premises and conclusion, unlike in the\ncase of combinations involving a categorical and a conditional, where figures\nand moods, as we shall see below, are determined by the categorical\npremise and another categorical proposition, which is either the consequent or the\nantecedent of the other (conditional) premise. \nThe moods presented below are not unrestrictedly productive. In several\ncases their productivity depends on whether the conditional is\nimplicative (luzūmī) or coincidental\n(ittifāqī). I list moods that Avicenna regards to\nbe valid once the required qualifications are added, but for the sake\nof simplicity the latter are not expressed in the notation. \nThe first figure comprises the four characteristic moods, which are\ndescribed as perfect (kāmil). Avicenna discusses at some\nlength the status of this figure with respect to whether the\nconditionals it expresses are luzūmī or\nittifāqī. \nFirst figure \nSecond figure \nAgain, the conditions of productivity depend on the kind of\nconditional expressed in each of the premises. For example,  \nIf the negative [premise] is [the negation] of an implication, which is compatible with\n[mere] coincidence, and the affirmative [premise] affirms coincidence, then the syllogism will not be productive at\nall. (Qiyās VI.1, 300.2–3)  \nOn the other hand “If the affirmative premise is an implication,\nthe combination will be productive” (Qiyās VI.1, 300.9–10) regardless of the status of the negative premise. \nAll of the above moods may be proved, according to Avicenna, either by\nconverting one of the premises or by reductio (and in the\ncase of Baroco, by the analogue of an ecthetic proof, where the\ninstantiated element is a specified “case and time”). \nThird figure \nJust as in the first and second figure, these moods are typically proved\nby conversion or by reductio. \nHypothetical syllogisms consisting of a conditional and a disjunctive\npremise are second, in terms of complexity, only to the combination of\nconditionals and categoricals (type 4 below). The proof of the\nproductive moods, in addition to the standard methods seen above,\noften involves turning a conditional premise into a disjunctive\npremise or vice versa (the analysis of these inferential relations occupies\nAvicenna in Qiyās VII.1–2, but he uses them freely\nthroughout Qiyās VI, before explicitly discussing them\nin the subsequent treatise). Similarly, after showing that a given\npremise pair yields a hypothetical conclusion of a certain kind,\nAvicenna often shows that it also yields a hypothetical conclusion of\nthe other kind, whether logically equivalent or simply implied by the\nformer. \nIn general, for this type of premises, the classification of arguments\nrests on the following criteria: which premise—major or\nminor—is conditional and which is disjunctive; whether the\nshared part (here always a\n proposition)\n is the antecedent or the consequent of the conditional;[18] whether the\ndisjunction is real or not; whether the parts of the disjunction are\naffirmative or negative; and whether the conditional is an implication\nor\n not.[19] \nAvicenna discusses various combinations\n(taʾlīfāt) of syllogisms, identified first on the basis of their major and minor premises, and then differentiated according to the\nother parameters. Individual moods, in analogy with categoricals, are\nidentified in function of the quality and quantity of their\n(hypothetical) premises. The combinations are accordingly distributed\ninto two main groups. In the first group, syllogisms have a\ndisjunctive major and a conditional minor. In the second group,\nsyllogisms have a conditional major and a disjunctive minor. \nGroup 1 (disjunctive major, conditional\nminor) \nCase 1: the disjunction is real and the\nshared part is the consequent of the conditional \nCase 2: the disjunction is unreal and the\nshared part is the consequent of the conditional \nCase 3: the disjunction is real and the\nshared part is the antecedent of the conditional \nCase 4.1: the disjunction is unreal, the\nshared part is the antecedent of the conditional and is\naffirmative \nCase 4.2: the disjunction is unreal, the\nshared part is the antecedent of the conditional and is negative \nGroup 2 (conditional major, disjunctive\nminor) \nCase 5: the disjunction is real and the\nshared part is the antecedent of the conditional \nCase 6.1: the disjunction is unreal, the\nshared part is the antecedent of the conditional and is\naffirmative \nCase 6.2: the disjunction is unreal, the\nshared part is the antecedent of the conditional and is negative \nCase 7: the disjunction is real, the shared\npart is the consequent of the conditional \nCase 8: the disjunction is unreal, the\nshared part is the consequent of the conditional \nAn example of case 1, from the first group, is the following (Qiyās VI.2,\n305.8–10): \nAlways, either C is D or A is B; Always, if H is Z, then C is D\n⊢ Always, if H is Z, then A is not B \nbut also (Nağāt 82, xix) \nAlways, either C is D or A is B; Always, if H is Z, then C is D\n⊢ Always, either H is Z or A is B \nAvicenna’s discussion, besides its intrinsic logical merits, is\nenriched by several examples (especially counterexamples put forward\nto show that certain moods are not productive) taken from the domains\nof physics and metaphysics. \nThe third type of hypothetical syllogisms is, by contrast, the simplest.\nIt involves premise pairs with two disjunctions. Avicenna notes that\nas a result of the status of real disjunctions, which are both exclusive\nand exhaustive, there can be no combination involving two such\npremises. The proof of this claim involves an interesting point about\nthe meaning of quantification in the case of disjunctions already\nraised at Qiyās V.5 (particular disjunctions express\nnon-exhaustive alternatives). \nFurthermore, this type is not arranged in figures because disjuncts\nare symmetrical (mutakāfiʾ), unlike the antecedent\nand the consequent of a conditional, which also implies that there is\nno distinction between major and minor premise (all permutations are\nequivalent, as they are not sensitive to order). \nThe combinations considered in this case all involve at least an\nunreal disjunction, which may be paired with a real disjunction, the\nnegation of a real disjunction or with another unreal disjunction,\nwhere the shared part may be affirmative or negative. \nThe first mood, where the two premises are both affirmative and one has a negative part, is as follows (Qiyās VI.3, 321.4–5) \nThe proof is based on turning the two disjunctive premises into the\nconditional statements that logically follow from them, namely\n\\((\\aD^{3})r\\neg q \\vdash (\\aC)\\neg r\\neg q\\), and \\((\\aD^{1})pr\n\\vdash (\\aC)p\\neg r\\). From such conditional premises, one may easily derive the conditional conclusion \\((\\aC)p\\neg q\\), which in turn entails the disjunctive proposition \\((\\aD^{1/3})\\neg p\\neg q\\). \nAn example with affirmative universal unreal disjunctive premises sharing a negative part \nis as follows (Qiyās VI.3, 323.14–324.5) \nwhich is equivalent to the following syllogism \nin virtue of inferential relations holding among disjunctions and\n conditionals.[20] \nThe first three types are pure hypothetical syllogisms. The fourth and\nfifth are mixed hypothetical syllogisms consisting of a hypothetical\npremise combined with a categorical. \nThe hypothetical syllogism consisting of a conditional and a\ncategorical premise is the most prominent case in the extensive\ntreatment of the Qiyās. The analysis occupies two chapters whose sequential order seems to be all but accidental. The classification of arguments\nfollows familiar criteria but in this case the order of priority is\ndifferent. The first parameter depends on what the shared part is. There\nare two main types according to whether the connection between major\nand minor premise obtains in the consequent (Qiyās VI.4)\nor in the antecedent of the conditional premise (Qiyās\nVI.5). The second parameter depends on whether the major is\ncategorical or conditional. \nWhat is shared in this case is a term that connects the categorical\npremise with another categorical, namely the antecedent or the\nconsequent of the conditional premise. This entails that syllogisms of\nthis type are in fact arguments “containing” a categorical\nsyllogism whose conclusion is either implied by or implies another\nproposition. This is perhaps the reason why the main division is given\nin terms of whether the sharing occurs (i) in the consequent or (ii)\nin the antecedent, and also the reason why the former case is taken to\nbe more relevant (or at least more common) in the sciences. For in\ncase (i), all syllogisms will yield the conclusion of the\ncorresponding categorical syllogism subject to a condition, namely as\nthe consequent of a conditional statement; whereas in case (ii) the\ninteraction between the quantification of the conditional and the\nquantification of the antecedent yields moods that only partially overlap with\nthe standard set of categorical moods and that are subject to various\nqualifications. \nBoth kinds of considerations—on the more natural character of\ncertain inference patterns and on their applicability to the sciences\n(Qiyās V.1, Nağāt\n82)—indirectly confirm that the hypothetical syllogistic is an\nintegral part of Avicenna's theory and practice of philosophical and\nscientific discourse. \nLast, the two types of mixed hypothetical syllogisms are the only cases in which\nAvicenna systematically investigates quantified atomic propositions\n(an obvious consequence of the fact that he is looking at inferences\nwhich, in conditional form, very much resemble those analyzed in the\ncategorical syllogistic). \nIn Qiyās VI.4, which generally deals with the group of\nsyllogisms where the sharing occurs in the consequent of the\nconditional premise, Avicenna investigates two cases: the first with a\ncategorical major and a conditional minor, the second with a conditional\nmajor and a categorical minor. It is not hard to see how this approach naturally yields conditional versions of the familiar figures and moods, in function of the position of the shared term. \nIn each case and figure, Avicenna distinguishes the moods also\naccording to the kind of quantified conditionals involved in the conditional\npremise and in the conditional conclusion. \nCase 1: categorical major, conditional minor, sharing\nin the consequent of the conditional; in three figures\n(Qiyās VI.4, 325.2–331.9) \nFirst figure: predicate of the consequent of the\nconditional = subject of the categorical major universal affirmative conditional premise Every B is C; Always, if H is Z, then every A is B\n⊢ Always, if H is Z, then every A is C (where p\nstands for “H is Z”) particular affirmative conditional premise: Avicenna simply states that there\nare four productive moods, presumably the analogues of the above where the minor\npremise and the conclusion are i-conditionals. universal negative conditional premise: in this case, the fact that\nthe conditional premise is negative affects the categorical\nconsequent, which is denied at all times and under all circumstances.\nAvicenna presents three moods that are in fact equivalent, in virtue\nof the relations of mutual implication discussed in Qiyās\nVII.1, to three moods of case (a) (he does not explicitly discuss the\nhypothetical equivalent of Celarent, which is also productive via the\ncorresponding Ferio): particular negative conditional premise: Avicenna states that\nthere are four productive moods, which must presumably be particular\nversions of the previous case, if we supplement the latter with a\ncounterpart of BeC; \\((\\textrm{e-}\\mathbb{C})p\\textrm{-AoB} ⊢\n(\\textrm{e-}\\mathbb{C})p\\textrm{-AiC}\\) (Avicenna does not discuss\nthis mood explicitly, but it is compatible with the general criteria\nof productivity he adopts, namely that the categorical major should be\nuniversal and the consequent of the conditional negative). \nSecond figure: predicate of the consequent of the\nconditional = predicate of the categorical major universal affirmative conditional premise When the conditional is particular, Avicenna contends that there\nare four additional moods. Negative (universals) are treated in\ngeneral terms: their criteria of productivity require the categorical\nmajor and the consequent of the conditional minor to be both\naffirmative or both negative, and the categorical to be universal. For\nexample, is valid in virtue of the familiar rules of\n transformation.[22] \nThird figure: subject of the consequent of the\nconditional = subject of the categorical major universal affirmative conditional premise When the conditional premises is quantified differently, the moods\nwill be revised forms of the above, just as in the case of the first\nand second figure. \nCase 2: conditional major, categorical minor, sharing\nin the consequent of the conditional; in three figures\n(Qiyās VI.4, 331.10–336.8). \nFirst figure: subject of the consequent of the\nconditional = predicate of the categorical minor \nuniversal affirmative conditional premise \nAlways, if H is Z, then every B is C; Every A is B\n⊢ Always, if H is Z, then every A is C \nWhen the conditional premise is (e-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)), (i-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)) or (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)), the moods are\nfour in each case, in virtue of the canonical equivalences. \nSecond and third figure: \nThe four conditional moods of the second figure (where the predicate\nof the consequent of the conditional is the predicate of the\ncategorical minor) and the six conditional moods of the third figure\n(where the subject of the consequent of the conditional is the subject of\nthe categorical minor) are treated in a similar way. In both cases the\nmoods correspond to those of the relevant categorical figures, in each\ncase with four variations depending on the quality and quantity of the\nconditional major. The transformations are the same as above. Avicenna\noccasionally gives a summary of the conditions of productivity (for\nexample, in second-figure moods where the conditional premise is\na universal negative, the consequent must be particular and have the\nsame quality as the categorical premise) without ever analyzing the\ncase of particular conditional premises explicitly. \nLast, it is worth noting that Avicenna explicitly characterizes the\nhypothetical syllogisms with an affirmative conditional major, a\ncategorical minor and a shared term in the consequent of the\ncategorical, as those in which the condition of productivity is that\nthe categorical and the consequent of the conditional should be related in the same way as in the connections\n(iqtirānāt) of first-figure categorical\nsyllogisms. In this case, \nthe conclusion is a conditional proposition whose consequent would be\nthe conclusion [produced] by the two categorical [propositions], were they to be taken in isolation [i.e., not as part of\na hypothetical syllogism]. (Qiyās VI.4, 331.13)  \nFor similar reasons, the same applies to the previous case (the\ncombination of a categorical major and a conditional minor). In this connection,\nAvicenna notes that the only difference between categorical syllogisms\nand hypothetical syllogisms with such characteristics is that in the\nformer the conclusion “follows without qualification, while here [it\nfollows] if something is posited” (Qiyās VI.4,\n325.14–5). \nThe second major division of hypothetical syllogisms consisting of a\nconditional and a categorical premise obtains when the sharing occurs in\nthe antecedent. The analysis of these syllogisms is the subject of\nQiyās VI.5, which is the only place in the corpus where\nthey are treated explicitly. Elsewhere (e.g., Nağāt\n82), hypothetical syllogisms of this kind are said to be less used in\nthe sciences. In spite of the structural analogy to the cases\ndiscussed above (the conclusion is still a conditional proposition,\neven though here the categorical “fragment” occupies the\nplace of the antecedent), the way the quantification of the\nconditional and the quantification of the antecedent interact generate\nresults that do not generally mirror categorical syllogisms. The\nclassification is parallel to the previous case and consists of two\nmain groups: the first with a conditional major and a categorical\nminor, the second with a categorical major and a conditional minor.\nEach group is divided into three figures, as above, and the moods of\neach figure are analyzed with respect the four combinations of quality\nand quantity of the conditional premise. \nThe second kind of mixed hypothetical syllogisms consists of a\ndisjunctive and a categorical premise (or several categorical\npremises). It is at least briefly mentioned in all of Avicenna’s\nlogical works and receives a more extensive treatment in\nQiyās VI.6, 349.1–354.12. Like some of the types discussed above, this\nkind of hypothetical syllogism is indirectly acknowledged to have an\napplication outside the domain of formal logic, as Avicenna contends\nthat, with certain qualifications, it expresses a mode of reasoning\nsimilar to that involved in the method of induction\n(Qiyās VI.6, Burhān I.7). This obtains when a hypothetical syllogism of this type expresses a\ncomplete division, the predication is real\n(ḥaqīqī), and the subject is the subject of\nthe disjunctive proposition, in which case it is called “divided\nsyllogism” (qiyās muqassam). \nAvicenna explores different possibilities in turn. With the help\nof the shorter treatment in the Nağāt, an\nunderlying structure may be identified, where the order is inverted\nwith respect to the way in which materials are arranged in the Qiyās. He distinguishes\nbetween two main groups of syllogisms, one (i) in which the\ncategorical premise is only one; the other (ii) in which multiple\ncategoricals are involved. \nIn the first case, the most natural arrangement is when the minor is\nan affirmative categorical and its predicate is the subject of the\ndisjunctive major. The example at Nağāt 82, xvi “Everything countable is either even or\nodd; every large quantity is countable; therefore, every large\nquantity is either even or odd” is in line with the general\nscheme “Always, every B is either H or Z; every C is B;\ntherefore, always, every C is either H or Z” given at\nQiyās VI.6, 353.8–9. In the Nağāt Avicenna\nasserts that this arrangement comes in four combinations, and both in the\nQiyās and in the Nağāt he refers to the\nabove as (a mood of) the first figure. Admissible variants seem to be\nthose involving a particular major and minor, or a universal negative\nmajor (or affirmative with negative parts). The second figure is said\nto be non-productive (and is consistently not mentioned in the\nNağāt), while the third figure is said to conclude\nby conversion but is not discussed any further. \nIn the second case, where the major is categorical and the minor\ndisjunctive, the major consists in fact of multiple categoricals, which must\nbe as many in number as the parts of the disjunction (to ensure a\nproper connection). Every categorical and every disjunct are connected\nby a term; and all the parts of the disjunction share a\n term.[24]\n This yields two basic sub-cases, each arranged in figures. A schema\nfrom the first figure associated with the notion of a complete\ninduction is “Every C and H and Z is A; every B is either C or H\nor Z; therefore every B is A”. It is illustrated by the example  \nEvery animal is a body and every plant is a body and every mineral is\na body; everything that moves is either an animal or a plant or a\nmineral; therefore everything that moves is a body.\n(Nağāt 82, xvii) \nHypothetical syllogisms whose premises share an incomplete part\nare perhaps best understood in opposition to two types of purely\nhypothetical syllogisms discussed above, namely those consisting of a\npair of disjunctive premises and those consisting of a disjunctive and\na conditional premise. In both cases, the shared part was a whole\nproposition. Syllogisms involving hypotheticals that share an\nincomplete part are a variation on the latter, determined by the fact\nthat the shared element is a term instead of a whole proposition. They\nmay involve either (i) two disjunctive premises or (ii) a conditional\nand a disjunctive premise with one term in common (in the latter case,\nwith a conditional minor). An example is given at Nağāt\n82, xx. \nAvicenna’s cursory treatment of this case may be at the origin\nof a much more elaborate development in the analysis of this class of hypothetical syllogisms in Post-Avicennan logic, starting with\nKaššī (El-Rouayheb 2010). \nThe repetitive (istiṯnāʾī) syllogistic\ncovers inference patterns such as modus ponens and modus\ntollens (in their conditional and disjunctive variants). It\nconstitutes the other major division of the syllogistic along with the\nconnective (iqtirānī) syllogistic and seems to be regarded by Avicenna as somehow\ndependent on it (a systematic\ndiscussion of the reducibility of the former to the latter occupies\npart of Qiyās IX.1, where Avicenna\ndiscusses among other things the idea that the major premise of modus\nponens may be in a sense redundant). \nRepetitive syllogisms consist of (i) a hypothetical premise\n(conditional or disjunctive) containing the conclusion or its negation as one of its\nparts, and (ii) another premise which asserts or denies\n(and thereby “repeats”) part of the hypothetical premise. Example of\nnotable argument forms of this kind are the following \nwhere the hypothetical premise is a conditional (Avicenna also\nconsiders the case of bi-conditionals), and \nwhere the hypothetical premise is a disjunction (either real or\nunreal). \nAvicenna’s account of reductio is an interesting case\nin which several of his technical distinctions come into play. A\nreductio is a compound syllogism (qiyās\nmurakkab)—i.e., a concatenation of\nsyllogisms—consisting of a connective hypothetical syllogism\nand of a repetitive syllogism. Both categorical and hypothetical\npropositions may be proved by reductio. \nAt Nağāt 91, i, Avicenna offers a straightforward example of a\nreductio proof of AaB in the categorical syllogism CaB; AaC\n⊢ AaB, where (1) is the connective hypothetical syllogism (with a conditional minor) and (2) the\nrepetitive syllogism (an instance of modus tollens): \nFirst syllogism (connective hypothetical of type 4, with a conditional minor) Second syllogism (repetitive) \nIn Qiyās VIII.3 Avicenna discusses a version of\nreductio in which the conclusion aimed at\n(maṭlūb) is a hypothetical (conditional)\nproposition: \nHypothetical case: (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))qr; (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pr ⊢\n(o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pq \nFor a recent analysis of the logical properties of reductio\nin Avicenna and its general significance see (Hodges 2017). \nThe theory of demonstration represents for Avicenna not only an\nessential part of logic but its true culmination. Its central problems\nare the identification of (i) the conditions under which\ncertainty (yaqīn) may be attained in making\nassertions within the context of a scientific discipline and the\nidentification of (ii) the conditions under which completeness,\nrelevance, and accuracy may be achieved in the process of concept\nformation that leads to definitions. This determines in turn the\nnature of the principles assumed in each science for the derivation of\nits own theorems, the way in which boundaries between disciplines\nare drawn, and more generally the overall architecture of scientific\nknowledge. \nAvicenna’s original contributions in this area include: (1)\nre-casting the model of the Posterior Analytics in terms of\nthe two fundamental notions of conception and assertion (Strobino 2010\nand 2015b), associating them with (2) a more systematic, and\nultimately simplified, treatment of the four Aristotelian questions\n(if, that, what, why) (Strobino 2015b); (3) a peculiar understanding\nof the notion of necessity in light of Avicenna's own distinction between the\nreferential/substantial and the descriptional reading (Strobino\n2015a); (4) a sophisticated account of per se, linked with the\ntheory of the predicables (Strobino 2016b); (5) an elaborate model for the classification of the\nsciences (Strobino 2017); (6) an innovative classification of that-\nand why-demonstrations (Strobino forthcoming); and (7) a commitment to\nthe applicability of formal logic as a whole to scientific discourse,\nfor instance through the explicit acknowledgment of the fact that the principles\nand conclusions of demonstrative arguments may be both categorical and\nhypothetical propositions, and that categorical as well as\nhypothetical (and repetitive) syllogisms play a role in the\nsciences. \nIn this area, Avicenna’s work reflects in complex ways the\ninfluence not only of al-Fārābī but also of the Greek\ncommentary tradition, especially Themistius and Philoponus, whose\nexegetical work on the Posterior Analytics, now lost in\nArabic, was available to Avicenna. This becomes especially evident\nthrough implicit or explicit references to the commentators\n(mufassirūn) and their commentaries (tafāsīr,\nšurūḥ) disseminated in his own Kitāb\nal-Burhān (Eichner 2010, Strobino 2012, forthcoming). \nThe distinction between conception\n(taṣawwur) and assertion (taṣdīq)\ncomes into play in several crucial ways in Avicenna’s logic of\nscientific discourse. \nThe distinctive mark of demonstrative\narguments—certainty—is characterized in terms of assertion. An assertion p is certain if and only if  one holds (i) the\njustified belief that p and (ii) the justified belief that\np cannot be otherwise; a demonstrative argument is one in\nwhich certainty is transferred from premises to conclusion.\nDemonstrative assertions are explicitly identified by Avicenna in the\nframework of a broader classification of various types of assertions\nof decreasing epistemic strength (certain, endoxic, suppositional,\nfallacious), which are in turn associated with a canonical taxonomy of\nlogical disciplines (demonstration, dialectic, rhetoric, sophistic)\n(Gutas 2012; Hasnawi 2013; Black 1990). \nFurthermore, Avicenna’s flavor of Aristotelian foundationalism,\ni.e., the view that in every science there are first principles on which everything else depends and which do not depend in\nturn on anything else, is expressed in terms of the need for (i)\nimmediate assertions (taṣdīqāt) that are not\ngrounded on further assertions and (ii) for the conceptions\n(taṣawwurāt) of primitive notions. \nThe notion of conception is also crucial for Avicenna’s theory\nof per se (ḏātī), where a basic distinction between types of scientific\npredicates depends on whether they are conceptually inseparable from\ntheir subjects or not (Strobino 2016b). \nThe four Aristotelian questions—if, that, what, and\nwhy—discussed in Posterior Analytics B1–2 are\nsubject to a more systematic analysis in Avicenna’s\nBurhān I.5 and IV.1. In Burhān I.5, in particular, they are rearranged in three pairs with\nseveral internal subdivisions: (i) what (mā), with\nrespect to the meaning of the name or with respect to the essence;\n(ii) why (limā), with respect to unqualified existence or\nwith respect to existence in a given state; and (iii) if (hal)/that\n(anna), again with respect to unqualified existence or with respect to existence in\na given state. The notion of existence in a state in (ii) and (iii) encapsulates the case of attribute ascription in its causal and factual version, respectively. The three pairs of questions may apply to both subject\nand predicate of a scientific statement. \nAvicenna explores various relations and concludes that what- and\nif-questions, in some of their declensions, are more fundamental in\ncharacter, as why-questions ultimately reduce to questions about the\nessence of something, and if-questions express crucial necessary\nconditions for any science, namely the existence of basic entities in\nits domain and the assumption of certain fundamental predicative\nclaims about them. \nThe classification of questions is inspired by the idea of reducing them\nto the two basic paths of scientific knowledge: conception and\nassertion and their discursive counterparts, definition and syllogism\n(Strobino 2015b). \nOne of the single most important theoretical revisions of the\nAristotelian model concerns the notion of necessity (ḍarūra), which in fact\ntakes on a new role in Avicenna’s system in a number of\ndifferent ways. At a general level, there is an epistemic notion\nassociated with the idea of certainty mentioned above; then there is a\ntechnical sense involved in Avicenna’s reading of necessity\nstatements (which are unsurprisingly a major ingredient of scientific\ntheories); and finally there is a notion of necessity associated with\nscientific predication, which in a way is the most fundamental of\nall. \nTake “triangle” as a subject of predication and consider\nthe following two sets of attributes: (i) “being a\nplane figure enclosed by three straight lines” or simply\n“being a plane figure”, and (ii) “having three\nangles” or “having the sum of the internal angles equal to\ntwo right angles”. All of these attributes are necessarily true of\n“triangle” but, according to Avicenna, they are necessarily true of\ntheir subject in two quite different ways. The first two attributes,\n“being a plane figure” and “being a plane figure\nenclosed by three straight lines” are essential\nattributes of “triangle” (the former is its genus, the latter is its\ndefinition); they are constitutive of it in a way that\nthe other attributes are not. Furthermore, “being a figure” is\nconceptually inseparable from “triangle” and contained\nin its definition, in the sense that we cannot properly define\n“triangle”, in its true nature, without appealing to that notion. By contrast\n“having the sum of the internal angles equal to two right angles”\nis not at all required to define “triangle”, even if it is necessarily\nimplied by it, and is in fact an attribute that we typically prove to\nhold of its subject. Essential attributes of the first kind are captured\nby definitions, and in general have an explanatory role with respect\nto attributes of the other kind. They explain the fact that attributes\nof the other kind hold of their subjects. In Aristotle’s theory\nof science, these two types of attributes are usually designated by\nthe technical term “per se”. \nAvicenna also originally puts his own distinction between the\nreferential/substantial and descriptional reading to use in his theory\nof science. Each of the above two types of necessity (essential and\nnon-essential) can hold on either reading. In particular, the\ndescriptional reading, which Avicenna takes to be the default sense of\nnecessity in scientific discourse, allows us to study the properties\nof a given object qua object of a certain kind (a bronze\ntriangle qua triangle) and to make true, necessary\npredications about it as long as it is a triangle (but not as\nlong as it exists, as a bronze triangle could be re-cast into a\ndifferent shape and lose some of the properties that necessarily hold\nof it qua triangle) (Strobino 2015a). \nAvicenna’s elaborate account of per se predication elevates the\nrole of a technical distinction internal to the Aristotelian model and\nassigns it a larger and more systematic theoretical relevance, where\nthree levels of discourse are linked in an original way: (i) the\ntheory of per se itself, (ii) a distinction between types of metaphysical\nnecessity of different strength, captured by the notion of\ncontainment (taḍammun) and necessary implication (iltizām), and (iii) a distinction between\ntypes of inseparability, which grounds the other two. All three levels\nexpress in different ways the dichotomy between essential and\nnon-essential necessity (Strobino 2016b, forthcoming). \n(i) The notion of a per se attribute is ultimately linked with the\nidea that in a scientific theory the admissible terms must be salient\nproperties of the objects under investigation. Avicenna argues that it\nis only through this regimented conceptual vocabulary that the two\ndefining conditions of scientific knowledge (necessity and explanatory\ncharacter) can be met by a theory. In doing so, he provides a\nsystematic account of per se which elaborates on Aristotle’s\ncursory remarks in Posterior Analytics A4 and A22. The Aristotelian\nanalysis of per se is based on the relation of “being part of the definition, i.e. of the essence, of something”: a\nterm A is per se 1 with respect to another term B if and only if A is part of the\ndefinition of B while a term A is per se 2 with respect to another term B if and only if B\nis part of the definition of A. \nAvicenna connects the definition and classification of the two primary\ntypes of per se relation to the concepts of constituent\n(muqawwim)—the counterpart of per se 1—and\nimplicate (lāzim)—the counterpart of per se\n2—two characteristic notions of his system associated with\ndifferent kinds of metaphysical necessity. \n(ii) These different kinds of metaphysical necessity are the\ncounterparts of two types of entailment which Avicenna calls\ncontainment and necessary implication and which express necessary\nconnections of different strength between terms. Containment is the\nrelation between a notion and its intensional parts (i.e., the\nconstituents of its definition, which are ontologically part of its\nessence). Necessary implication is a weaker form of necessity holding\nbetween two notions that are merely inseparable. \n(iii) The above pairs (per se 1 and 2, and containment and necessary\nimplication) are associated with a further distinction between two\ntypes of inseparability. The theme is developed by Avicenna especially in connection with the Isagoge, most notably in Madḫal I.5, I.6, and I.8. The first type is conceptual inseparability (the\ncounterpart of per se 1 and containment); the second type is\ninseparability in imagination (the counterpart of per se 2 and\nnecessary implication) (Strobino 2016b). \nAnother interesting feature of Avicenna’s account of per se is\nthe attempt to develop systematically the Aristotelian criteria and to\nidentify the sets of per se predicates relevant for a given kind or\ndomain of scientific discourse. This has a significant impact on his\ntaxonomy of the interrelations among the sciences. \nAvicenna’s classification (or division) of the sciences is a\nnatural complement to his treatment of per se as well as being one of the\nmost innovative attempts to develop systematically the material on the subordination of scientific disciplines in Posterior Analytics A7, A9,\nand A13. It is also important for an historical reason.\nAvicenna’s account of the division of the sciences is in fact\nthe only part of his Burhān that actually had a direct\nimpact on the Western Latin tradition. \nThe source of Avicenna’s classification is a chapter from his\nBurhān famously translated and encapsulated by the\ntwelfth-century Toledan philosopher and translator Dominicus\nGundissalinus (ca. 1110–1190) in his De divisione philosophiae. In the first\npart, Avicenna presents a basic classification of the types of\nhierarchical relations holding between various pairs of sciences, based on the corresponding\nrelations holding between their underlying subjects. At the root of the division\nis a distinction between sciences that differ because (a) they have\ntwo distinct subjects or (b) because they treat one and the same\nsubject in different ways. He articulates in full the\nprimary divisions of scientific domains, offering an analysis and\ncategorization of basic types of relations and dependencies (most notably, parthood\nand subordination). In the second part, Avicenna develops a complementary classification\nof the criteria of identity and distinctness for the sciences focusing\non the ways in which sciences may have elements in common. In this context, he addresses\nthe question from a different perspective—that of the canonical\nthree elements of an Aristotelian science—including not only the\nsubjects, but also scientific principles and questions (masāʾil), i.e., the\nconclusions of scientific syllogisms (the theorems of a science). \nThe use of three fundamental criteria—subject/genus\n(mawḍūʿ/ğins), principles\n(mabādiʾ), and per se attributes\n(ʿawāriḍ ḏātiyya)—to\ndetermine identity, overlap, or distinctness between domains of\nscientific inquiry is in line with Aristotelian orthodoxy. But\nAvicenna takes the criteria to a whole different level and articulates\na complex network of relations of superordination and subordination\nwhereby scientific knowledge is rigidly organized in hierarchical\nstructures that reflect underlying ontological relations between their\nobjects and attributes. For a detailed account see (Hugonnard-Roche 1988) and (Strobino 2017). \nAvicenna’s re-interpretation of the distinction between a\ndemonstration that something is the case and a demonstration why\nsomething is the case is related (i) to the classification of per se,\ni.e., to the types of predicates used in demonstrative arguments,\nand (ii) to the division of the sciences (Strobino forthcoming). \nAvicenna distinguishes between two main types of demonstration in function of the types of predicates involved (in first-figure\ncategorical syllogisms): (a) those in which the middle term expresses\na per se 2 attribute of the minor, in which case the major may be\neither (aa) a per se 2 attribute of the middle or (ab) a per se 1\nattribute of the middle; and (b) those in which the middle term\nexpresses a per se 1 attribute of the minor, in which case the major is\nin most cases (ba) a per se 2 attribute of the middle, and only in two exceptional cases (bb) a per se 1 attribute of the middle (the reason is that\nusually demonstrations do not aim to prove that per se 1 attributes\nhold of their subjects, these relations being self-evident and captured by\ndefinitions). \nWhile proving an assertion, a demonstration may merely provide\nan inferential justification of it or, in addition to that, also the terms that causally explain why things are the way they are. All demonstrations of the\nfirst kind are that-demonstrations; all demonstrations of the second\nkind are why-demonstrations. \nWhy-demonstrations may express why (i) a certain attribute holds of a\nsubject or (ii) both why it holds of that subject and why it exists.\nIn this connection, Avicenna aims to draw a distinction between two different kinds of\nexplanation. The fact that the attribute of having the sum of the internal angles\nequal to two right angles holds of isosceles triangles because they\nare triangles is an example of the first kind: the attribute is true of\nsomething in virtue of its being true of a per se 1 attribute (in this case its genus) of that thing. The fact that vines are deciduous because they are wide-leaved\nis an example of the second kind. The distinction is parallel to a\ndistinction proposed for Aristotle between application arguments and\nsubject-attribute demonstrations (McKirahan 1992). Avicenna’s\naccount of per se fits neatly into this scheme, where case (aa)\ncorresponds to why-demonstration of type (ii), and case (ba)\ncorresponds to why-demonstrations of type (i) (Strobino\nforthcoming). \nThat-demonstrations are also divided into two types, depending on\nwhether the context is one in which there is (iii) a causal relation\nbetween subject and predicate or (iv) not. Case (iii) is the most\ncommon type of that-demonstration, which typically obtains when the\nmiddle term (in the first figure) is the effect of the existence of\nthe major instead of being its cause (the opposite of type-(ii)\nwhy-demonstration). Case (iv) is a peculiar kind of that-demonstration which Avicenna\nincludes to account for immediate predications where an attribute\ndirectly follows, without mediation, from something’s essence,\nwhich is the only case in which a that-demonstration may be associated\nwith certainty; or for cases where two attributes that are both\neffects of a cause are used to prove one another of a subject\n(Strobino 2016a, forthcoming). \nA point that Avicenna borrows from al-Fārābī (Strobino\n2017) is the acknowledgment of the fact that the logical forms of scientific\nstatements (whether premises or conclusions) include both categorical\nand hypothetical propositions and that demonstrative arguments may be\nboth categorical and hypothetical (or even repetitive) syllogisms.\nWhat may look like a minor technical point has in fact significant\nimplications for a better understanding of some of Avicenna’s\nmotives in developing his formal logic. \nAvicenna is open about the fact that the project undertaken in\nthe investigation of formal aspects of logic goes beyond its application in\nthe sciences (Qiyās\n IV.1).[25] \nAt the same time he is also open about the fact that the formal apparatus\ndeveloped in the syllogistic is not exclusively analyzed for the sake\nof studying its properties as a logical system. In fact, on multiple\noccasions Avicenna tells us that the various tools developed for\ninstance in the Qiyās are used in the sciences, or offers\nremarks on theoretical questions by specifying the default\ninterpretation in the context of scientific reasoning. This is the case (just to mention a few significant examples) in\nthe discussion of reductio ad absurdum and conditionals with\nimpossible antecedents and consequents (Qiyās\nV.4–5); in his account of descriptional necessity as the\ncanonical reading of necessity propositions (Burhān\nII.1, Qiyās II.2, Nağāt 123); in\nthe acknowledgment that premises and conclusions of scientific syllogisms may\nbe categorical as well as hypothetical propositions\n(Qiyās V.1, Burhān II.6); when he contends\nthat certain hypothetical syllogisms are less used in the sciences\n(Nağāt 82); when he draws connections between the\ntwo areas (Qiyās VI.5, Burhān I.7:\ninduction and qiyās muqassam; Burhān IV.1:\nif-question and conditional reasoning); or in maintaining the conditional character\nof certain principles in the particular sciences (Burhān II.7)\n(Strobino 2017). \nWhile the formal development of logic undeniably acquires for Avicenna\nan autonomous status that invites its own independent theoretical\nquestions, to see it as an entirely separate enterprise, detached from\napplication in the context of scientific discourse, would betray a\nmisconception of his intentions as well as of his practice. \nThe treatment of fallacies addresses one of the complementary\nconditions expressed by the definition of logic, which is supposed to\ndeal not only with what is required in order to infer correctly what\nis unknown from what is known, but also with what is required to avoid\nerror in the case of inferences that appear legitimate without being\nso. There is a parallel in the case of conception and definition:\nlogic provides rules to identify and construct definitions and at the\nsame time instructions on how to avoid common errors in the process.\nAvicenna’s analysis of fallacious reasoning attempts to combine\n(or perhaps force) Aristotle’s treatment from the\nSophistical Refutations into a broader scheme driven by more\nsystematic concerns, which even in the extensive treatment of the\nCure is rather compact. The analysis of error in defining is\nusually covered in connection with the Posterior Analytics and\nthe Topics (for instance at Burhān IV,\nĞadal, IV, Nağāt 149). I will focus\nhere only on the former. \nThe Nağāt treatment perfectly captures this complex\nstrategy. It starts with a canonical distinction between fallacies as\n(i) dependent on expression (lafẓ) or (ii) dependent on\nmeaning (maʿnā)—the familiar distinction\nbetween de dictione and extra dictionem\n(language-dependent and language-independent) fallacies—and\npairs it with the claim that fallacies are also either dependent on\n(iii) the form or on (iv) the matter of an argument, an aspect that is\npresent also in the cursory classification given in the\nIšārāt (Street forthcoming). \nThe analysis continues with an attempt to “deduct” the\nfallacies based on the idea that when a false conclusion is reached,\nthen at least one of the characteristic conditions of syllogistic\nreasoning must not have been met. It then proceeds to articulate a\ndetailed account of the different ways in which failure to meet those\nconditions corresponds to different items in Aristotle’s famous\nlist of thirteen fallacies, which Avicenna occasionally groups or divides in\nslightly different ways, especially in the case of those that are dependent\non expression. \nThe discussion ends with a recapitulation that yields something very\nclose to Aristotle’s list, even though in a few cases it is hard\nto pinpoint where exactly certain items belong in the systematic\nanalysis. \nThe primary reasons of error may be abstracted from a strong\ncharacterization of a syllogism. If a syllogistic argument is (a)\narranged according to one of the figures and its mood is productive,\n(b) it has primary distinct parts (terms) and secondary distinct parts\n(premises), (c) its premises are true, (d) distinct from and (e)\nbetter known than the conclusion, then a true conclusion must follow.\nOtherwise, at least one of conditions (a)–(e) has not been\nmet. \nAvicenna unequivocally identifies two of the fallacies that are not\ndependent on expression with (d) and (e), namely petitio\nprincipii (muṣādara ʿalā\nl-maṭlūb al-awwal) and positing what is not a cause as\na cause (aḫḏ or waḍʿ mā laysa\nbi-ʿilla ʿillatan). The latter is identified with\ncircular proof (bayān ad-dawr), which is consistent with\nthe doctrine of Qiyās IX.4 and Burhān\nII.1. \nThe fallacy of consequent (īhām ʿaks\nal-lawāzim or īhām al-ʿaks) can be\ntraced back to a subdivision of (c). \nThe fallacy of combining many questions (ğamʿ\nal-masāʾil) is listed in the Nağāt without being discussed and it is altogether absent from the\nIšārāt. In Safsaṭa I.3,\nhowever, Avicenna seems to treat this case, too, as a subdivision of (c). \nTwo other canonical fallacies of type (ii), namely the fallacy of\naccident (mā bi-l-ʿaraḍ) and secundum\nquid (sūʾ iʿtibār al-ḥaml or\niġfāl tawābiʿ al-ḥaml) are listed\nat the end of the Nağāt section without being discussed, although\nthey, too, may presumably be classified as subdivisions of (c), namely\nerrors based on taking a premise to be true which merely appears to be\ntrue. \nThe case of ignoratio elenchi is more problematic. The last\navailable slot in the Nağāt list is called\n“sterility of the connection” (ʿaqm\nal-qarīna) and is seemingly not discussed in the preceding\nanalysis. A possibility is to associate it with case (a), namely with\nthe error resulting from failing to recognize an argument as invalid,\nwhich would however distort the original Aristotelian meaning. It may\nbe that Avicenna fails (or refuses) to recognize ignoratio\nelenchi in Aristotle’s sense and perhaps turns into\nsomething like the error resulting from a lack of awareness of the form of\nthe syllogism, which leads to accept an invalid argument as valid.\nThis would be consistent with the Išārāt\nvocabulary, which introduces the “ignorance of the\ncomposition” (ǧahl at-taʿlīf) as a\nfallacy while at the same time failing to mention ignoratio\nelenchi. \nIn the Nağāt, fallacies dependent on expressions\nseem to be variously associated with cases (a)–(c). Avicenna\ndivides this category into two main sub-cases involving (i) a\nsimple expression (lafẓ mufrad) or (ii) a compound\nexpression (lafẓ murakkab). \nIn case (i), error may result from the association of multiple\nmeanings with an expression either in its core form\n(ğawhar) or in a derivative form (hayʾa).\nThe first case is proper equivocation (ištirāk\nal-ism) (even though Avicenna uses the term also to refer\ngenerically to other types of language-dependent fallacies) and is in\nfact divided into a number of different sub-types (lafẓ\nmuštarak, mušakkak, mutašābih, lafẓ\nmanqūl, mustaʿār, mağāz). The second\ncase is where Avicenna puts the counterpart of the fallacies of accent\nand form of expression (or inflection). \nCase (ii) includes the canonical fallacies of composition\n(tarkīb al-lafẓ) and division\n(tafṣīl al-lafẓ). \nThe case of amphiboly (judging from the examples) seems to be treated\nas an independent type, associated with (b), but its omission in the\nfinal Nağāt list may suggest that Avicenna, in line with what he does in the\nIšārāt, possibly regards it as a sub-type of\nequivocation. \nThe treatment of fallacies is complemented by a parallel\nclassification of fallacious assertions (propositions that are deemed\nto be true because of a systematic error in their evaluation)\nconsistently discussed throughout Avicenna’s logical works\n(e.g., Burhān I.4, Išārāt\nI.6). \nI use standard abbreviations for quantified categorical propositions:\na-, e-, i-, and o-propositions (universal affirmative, universal\nnegative, particular affirmative, and particular negative). \nIn the case of modalized categoricals, the modality is prefixed (for\nthe one-sided absolute proposition, I omit the identifier X1\nunless required to avoid ambiguity).\nA full list of abbreviations is given below. For example, Ld1-AaB\nstands for “Every A is\nnecessarily B as long as it is A”, M1-AiB\nfor “Some A is possibly\nB”, and A-AeB for “No A is ever\nB”. \nIn the case of hypotheticals, I indicate first between parentheses\nquantification and type (conditional or disjunctive), followed by an\nindication of the quality and quantity of the parts (or, when the latter is not required, by simple propositional variables); in some cases the syntactic structure of an embedded categorical is made explicit in the above canonical form. Below are a few examples of expressions frequently used in this entry: \nOccasionally, a more fine-grained distinction between types of\nconditionals (luzūmī or ittifāqī) or types of disjunctions (exclusive and\nexhaustive; exclusive but non-exhaustive; inclusive) is required.\nSimilarly, it is sometimes necessary to identify antecedents and\nconsequents of conditionals (for conversion and inferential relations\nwith disjunctions). In such cases the above abbreviations are expanded\nto include the required additional information. For instance to\nexpress the claim that a universal affirmative exclusive and\nexhaustive disjunction implies a universal affirmative\nluzūmī conditional in which antecedent and\nconsequent are contradictories and may be any of the parts of the\ndisjunctive, I will write that\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\)1)a1a2 implies\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)a1o2,\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)a2o1,\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)o1a2, and\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)o2a1, where superscript\n“l” stands for luzūmī, and the\nsuperscript numbers are used to track the disjuncts where they appear\nas antecedent or consequent of the conditional statements.","contact.mail":"riccardo.strobino@tufts.edu","contact.domain":"tufts.edu"}]
