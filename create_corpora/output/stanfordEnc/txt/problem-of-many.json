It will look like a cloud, and\ncircumstances permitting rain like a cloud, and generally has as good a\nclaim to be a cloud as any other object in that part of the sky. But we\ncannot say every such object is a cloud, else there would be millions\nof clouds where it seemed like there was one. And what holds for clouds\nholds for anything whose boundaries look less clear the closer you look\nat it. And that includes just about every kind of object we normally\nthink about, including humans. Although this seems to be a merely\ntechnical puzzle, even a triviality, a surprising range of proposed\nsolutions has emerged, many of them mutually inconsistent. It is not\neven settled whether a solution should come from metaphysics, or from\nphilosophy of language, or from logic. Here we survey the options, and\nprovide several links to the many topics related to the Problem.\n\n\n\nIn his (1980), Peter Unger introduced the “Problem of the\nMany”. A similar problem appeared simultaneously in P. T. Geach\n(1980), but Unger's presentation has been the most influential over\nrecent years. The problem initially looks like a special kind of puzzle\nabout\n vague predicates,\n but that may be\nmisleading. Some of the standard solutions to\n Sorites paradoxes\n do not obviously help\nhere, so perhaps the Problem reveals some deeper truths involving the\nmetaphysics of material constitution, or the logic of statements\ninvolving identity. \n\nThe puzzle arises as soon as there is an object without clearly\ndemarcated borders. Unger suggested that clouds are paradigms of this\nphenomena, and recent authors such as David Lewis (1993) and Neil\nMcKinnon (2002) have followed him here. Here is Lewis's presentation of\nthe puzzle: \n\nThe paradox arises because in the story as told the following eight\nclaims each seem to be true, but they are mutually inconsistent. \n\nTo see the inconsistency, note that by 1 and 7 there is a cloud\ncomposed of water droplets. Say this cloud is composed of the water\ndroplets in si, and let sj be\nany other set whose members might, for all we can tell, form a cloud.\n(Premise 0 guarantees the existence of such a set.) By 3, the water\ndroplets in sj compose an object\noj. By 4, oj is not identical\nto our original cloud. By 6, oj is a cloud, and\nsince it is transparently in the sky, it is a cloud in the sky. By 5,\nthere are two clouds in the sky. But this is inconsistent with 2. A\nsolution to the paradox must provide a reason for rejecting one of the\npremises, or a reason to reject the reasoning that led us to the\ncontradiction, or the means to live with the contradiction. Since none\nof the motivations for believing in the existence of\n dialetheia\n apply here, I will ignore the\nlast possibility. And since 0 follows directly from the way the story\nis told, I will ignore that option as well. That leaves open eight\npossibilities. \n\n(The classification of the solutions here is slightly\ndifferent from that in Chapter One of Hud Hudson's “A Materialist\nMetaphysics of the Human Person.” But I have a deep debt to\nHudson's presentation of the range of solutions, which should be clear\nfrom the discussion that follows.) \n\nUnger's original solution was to reject 1. The concept of a cloud\ninvolved, he thought, inconsistent presuppositions. Since those\npresuppositions were not satisfied, there are no clouds. This is a\nrather radical move, since it applies not just to clouds, but to any\nkind of sortal for which a similar problem can be generated. And, Unger\npointed out, this includes most sortals. As Lewis puts it, “Think\nof a rusty nail, and the gradual transition from steel … to rust\nmerely resting on the nail. Or think of a cathode, and its departing\nelectrons. Or think of anything that undergoes evaporation or erosion\nor abrasion. Or think of yourself, or any organism, with parts that\ngradually come loose in metabolism or excretion or perspiration or\nshedding of dead skin.” (Lewis 1993: 165) \n\nDespite Lewis's presentation, the Problem of the Many is not a\nproblem about change. The salient feature of these examples is that, in\npractice, change is a slow process. Hence whenever a cathode, or a\nhuman, is changing, be it by shedding electrons, or shedding skin,\nthere are some things that are not clearly part of the object, nor\nclearly not part of it. Hence there are distinct sets that each have a\ngood claim to being the set of parts of the cathode, or of the human,\nand that is what is important. \n\nIt would be profoundly counterintuitive if there were no clouds, or\nno cathodes, or no humans, and that is probably enough to reject the\nposition, if any of the alternatives are not also equally\ncounterintuitive. It also, as Unger noted, creates difficulties for\nmany views about singular thought and talk. Intuitively, we can pick\nout one of the objects composed of water droplets by the phrase\n‘that cloud’. But if it is not a cloud, then possibly we\ncannot. For similar reasons, we may not be able to name any such\nobject, if we use any kind of reference-fixing description involving\n‘cloud’ to pick it out from other objects composed of water\ndroplets. If the problem of the many applies to humans as well as\nclouds, then by similar reasoning we cannot name or demonstrate any\nhuman, or, if you think there are no humans, any human-like object.\nUnger was happy to take these results to be philosophical discoveries,\nbut they are so counterintuitive that most theorists hold that they\nform a reductio of his theory. \n\nIt is interesting that some recent theories of vagueness have\nadopted positions resembling Unger's in some respects, but without the\nextreme conclusions. Matti Eklund (2002) and Roy Sorensen (2001) have\nargued that all vague concepts involve inconsistent presuppositions.\nSorensen spells this out by saying that there are some inconsistent\npropositions that anyone who possesses a vague concept should believe.\nIn the case of a vague predicate F that is vulnerable to a\nSorites paradox, the inconsistent propositions are that some things are\nFs, some things are not Fs, any object that closely\nresembles (in a suitable respect) something that is F is\nitself F, and that there are chains of ‘suitably\nresembling’ objects between an F and a non-F.\nHere the inconsistent propositions are that a story like Lewis's is\npossible, and in it 0 through 7 are true. Neither Eklund nor Sorensen\nconclude from this that nothing satisfies the predicates in question\nrather they conclude that some propositions that we find compelling\nmerely in virtue of possessing the concepts from which they are\nconstituted are false. So while they don't adopt Unger's nihilist\nconclusions, two contemporary theorists agree with him that vague\nconcepts are in some sense incoherent. \n\nA simple solution to the puzzle is to reject premise 2. Each of the\nrelevant fusions of water droplets looks and acts like a cloud, so it\nis a cloud. As with the first option this leads to some very\ncounterintuitive results. In any room with at least one person, there\nare many millions of people. But this is not as bad, I think, as saying\nthat there are no people. And perhaps we don't even have to\nsay the striking claim. In many circumstances, we quantify\nover a restricted domain. We can say, “There's no beer,”\neven when there is beer in some non-salient locales. With respect to\nsome restricted quantifier domains, it is true that there is exactly\none person in a particular room. The surprising result is that with\nrespect to other quantifier domains, there are many millions of people\nin that room. The defender of the over-population theory will hold that\nthis shows how unusual it is to use unrestricted quantifiers, not that\nthere really is only one person in the room. \n\nNo one has seriously defended the over-population solution to the\nproblem of the many. Hudson (2001: 34) attributes it to David\nLewis, but Lewis says he is rejecting 5 not rejecting 2. As Lewis says,\nhe is interested in a solution that, “concedes that the many are\n[clouds] but seeks to deny that the [clouds] are really many.”\n(On the other hand, if rejecting 5 is just incoherent, then it is not\nunfair to interpret Lewis as rejecting 2.) \n\nHudson (2001: 39–44) draws out a surprising consequence of the\nover-population solution as applied to people. Assume that there are\nreally millions of people just where we'd normally say there was\nexactly one. Call that person Charlie. When Charlie raises her arm,\neach of the millions must also raise their arms, for the millions\ndiffer only in whether or not they contain some borderline skin cells,\nnot in whether their arm is raised or lowered. Normally, if two people\nare such that whenever one acts a certain way, then so must the other,\nwe would say that at most one of them is acting freely. So it looks\nlike at most one of the millions of people around Charlie are free.\nThere are a few possible responses here, though whether a defender of\nthe over-population view will view this consequence as being more\ncounter-intuitive than other claims to which she is already committed,\nand hence whether it needs a special response, is not clear. There are\nsome other striking, though not always philosophically relevant,\nfeatures of this solution. To quote Hudson: \n\nAs Unger originally states it, the puzzle relies on a contentious\nprinciple of mereology. In particular, it assumes mereological\nUniversalism, the view that for any objects, there is an object that\nhas all of them as its fusion. (That is, it has each of those objects\nas parts, and has no parts that do not overlap at least one of the\noriginal objects.) Without this assumption, the Problem of the Many may\nhave an easy solution. The cloud in the sky is the object up\nthere that is a fusion of water droplets. There are many other sets of\nwater droplets, other than the set of water droplets that compose the\ncloud, but since the members of those sets do not compose an object,\nthey do not compose a cloud. \n\nThere are two kinds of theories that imply that only one of the sets\nof water droplets is such that there exists a fusion of its atoms.\nFirst, there are principled restrictions on composition,\ntheories that say that the xs compose an object y iff\nthe xs are F, for some natural property F.\nSecondly, there are brutal theories, which say it's just a\nbrute fact that in some cases the xs compose an object, and in\nothers they do not. It would be quite hard to imagine a principled\ntheory solving the Problem of the Many, since it is hard to see what\nthe principle could be. (For a more detailed argument for this, set\nagainst a somewhat different backdrop, see McKinnon 2002.) But a brutal\ntheory could work. And such a theory has been defended. Ned Markosian\n(1998) argues that not only does brutalism, the doctrine that there are\nbrute facts about when the xs compose a y, solves the\nProblem of the Many, the account of composition it implies fits more\nnaturally with our intuitions about composition. \n\nIt seems objectionable, in some not easy to pin down way, to rely on\nbrute facts in just this way. Here is how Terrence Horgan puts the\nobjection: \n\nOn the other hand, this kind of view does provide a particularly\nstraightforward solution to the Problem of the Many. As Markosian\nnotes, if we have independent reason to view favourably the idea that\nfacts about when some things compose an object are brute fact, which he\nthinks is provided by our intuitions about cases of composition and\nnon-composition, the very simplicity of this solution to the Problem of\nthe Many may count as an argument in favour of brutalism. \n\nAssume that the brutalist is wrong, and every for every set of water\ndroplets, there is an object those water droplets compose. Since that\nobject looks for all the world like a cloud, we will say it is a cloud.\nThe fourth solution accepts those claims, but denies that there are\nmany clouds. It is true that there are many fusions of atoms, but these\nare all the same cloud. This view adopts a position most\ncommonly associated with P. T. Geach (1980), that two things\ncan be the same F but not the same G, even though\nthey are both Gs. To see the motivation for that position, and\na discussion of its strengths and weaknesses, see the article on\n relative identity. \n\nHere I will just mention one objection that many have felt is\ntelling against the relative identity view. Let w be a water\ndroplet that is in s1 but not\ns2. The relative identity solution says that the\ndroplets in s1 compose an object\no1, and the droplets in s2\ncompose an object o2, and though\no1 and o2 are different fusions\nof water droplets, they are the same cloud. Call this cloud c.\nIf o1 is the same cloud as o2,\nthen presumably they have the same properties. But\no1 has the property of having w as a part,\nwhile o2 does not. Defenders of the relative\nidentity theory here deny the principle that if two objects are the\nsame F, they have the same properties. Many theorists find\nthis denial to amount to a reductio of the view. \n\nEven if o1 and o2 exist, and\nare clouds, and are not the same cloud, it does not immediately follow\nthat there are two clouds. If we analyse “There are two\nclouds” as “There is an x and a y such\nthat x is a cloud and y is a cloud, and x is\nnot the same cloud as y” then the conclusion will\nnaturally follow. But perhaps that is not the correct analysis of\n“There are two clouds.” Or, more cautiously, perhaps it is\nnot the correct analysis in all contexts. Following some suggestions of\nD. M. Armstrong's (Armstrong 1978, vol. 2: 37–8), David Lewis suggests\na solution along these lines. The objects o1 and\no2 are not the same cloud, but they are\nalmost the same cloud. And in everyday circumstances (AT) is a\ngood enough analysis of “There is one cloud” \n\nAs Lewis puts it, we ‘count by almost-identity’ rather\nthan by identity in everyday contexts. And when we do, we get the\ncorrect result that there is one cloud in the sky. Lewis notes that\nthere are other contexts in which we count by some criteria other than\nidentity. \n\nThere are two major objections to this theory. First, as Hudson\nnotes, even if we normally count by almost-identity, we know how to\ncount by identity, and when we do it seems that there is one cloud in\nthe sky, not many millions. A defender of Lewis's position may say that\nthe only reason this seems intuitive is that it is normally intuitive\nto say that there is only one cloud in the sky. And that intuition is\nrespected! More contentiously, it may be argued that it is a\ngood thing to predict that when we count by identity we get\nthe result that there are millions of clouds. After all, the only time\nwe'd do this is when we're doing metaphysics, and we have noted that in\nthe metaphysics classroom, there is some intuitive force to the\nargument that there are millions of clouds in the sky. It would be a\nbrave philosopher to endorse this as a virtue of the theory,\nbut it may offset some of the costs. \n\nSecondly, something like the Problem of the Many can arise even when\nthe possible objects are not almost identical. Lewis notes this\nobjection, and provides an illustrative example to back it up. A\nsimilar kind of example can be found in W. V. O. Quine's\nWord and Object (1960). Lewis's example is of a house with an\nattached garage. It is unclear whether the garage is part of the house\nor an external attachment to it. So it is unclear whether the phrase\n‘Fred's house’ denotes the basic house, call it the home,\nor the fusion of the home and the garage. What is clear is that there\nis exactly one house here. However, the home might be quite different\nfrom the fusion of the home and the garage. It will probably be smaller\nand warmer, for example. So the home and the home-garage fusion are not\neven almost identical. Quine's example is of something that looks, at\nfirst, to be a mountain with two peaks. On closer inspection we find\nthat the peaks are not quite as connected as first appeared, and\nperhaps they could be properly construed as two separate mountains.\nWhat we could not say is that there are three mountains here,\nthe two peaks and their fusions, but since neither peak is almost\nidentical to the other, or to the fusion, this is what Lewis's solution\nimplies. But perhaps it is wrong to understand almost identity in this\nway. Consider another example of Lewis's, one that Dan López de Sa\n(2014) argues is central to a Lewisian solution to the problem. One might think this is the general way to understand counting\nsentences in ordinary language. So There is exactly one F\ngets interpreted as There is an F, and no F is wholly distinct\nfrom it; and There are exactly two Fs gets interpreted\nas There are wholly distinct things x and y that are both F, and\nno F is wholly distinct from both of them, and so on. We can\neither take this to be a formal explication of Lewis's talk about\nalmost identity, or a new proposal; it's hard to see what would tell\nbetween those interpretations. However we understand the proposal, López de Sa notes that it has\na number of virtues. It seems to account for the puzzle involving the\nhouse, what he calls the Problem of the Two. If in general counting\ninvolves distinctness, then we have a good sense in which there is one\ncat on the mat, and Fred owns one house. There still remain two challenges for this view. First, one could\nstill follow Hudson and argue that even if we ordinarily understand\ncounting sentences this way, we do still know how to count by\nidentity. And when we do it seems that there is just one cat, not\nmillions of them. Second, it isn't that clear that we always count by\ndistinctness, in the way López de Sa suggests. If I say there are\nthree ways to get from my house to my office, I don't mean to say that\nthese three are completely distinct. Indeed, they probably all start\nwith going out my door, down my driveway etc, and end by walking up\nthe stairs into my office. So the general claim about how to\nunderstand counting sentences seems false. \n\nA crucial part of the argument that the Problem of the Many is the\nargument that every oi is a cloud. If we can find a\nway to reject that step, then we the argument collapses. There are\nthree obvious arguments for this premise, two of them presented\nexplicitly by Unger, and the other by Geach. Two of the arguments seem\nto be faulty, and the third can be rejected if we adopt some familiar,\nthough by no means universally endorsed, theories of vagueness. The\nfirst argument, due essentially to Geach, runs as follows. Geach's\npresentation did not involve clouds, but the principles are clearly\nstated in his version of the argument. (The argument shows that an\nok is a cloud for arbitrary k, we can\neasily generalize to the claim that for every i,\noi is a cloud.) \n\nD2. Whether ok is a cloud does not depend on\nwhether things distinct from it exist. \n\nC. ok is a cloud. \n\nD2 implies that being a cloud is an\n intrinsic\n property. The idea is that\nby changing the world outside the cloud, we do not change whether or\nnot it is a cloud. There is, however, little reason to believe this is\ntrue. And given that it leads to a rather implausible conclusion, that\nthere are millions of clouds where we think there is one, some reason\nto believe it is false. We can argue directly for the same conclusion.\nAssume many more water droplets coalesce around our original cloud.\nThere is still one cloud in the sky, but it determinately includes more\nwater droplets than the original cloud. The fusion of those water\ndroplets exist, and we may assume that they did not change their\nintrinsic properties, but they are now a part of a cloud, rather than a\ncloud. Even if something looks like a cloud, smells like a cloud and\nrains like a cloud, it need not be a cloud, it may only be a part of a\ncloud. \n\nUnger's primary argument takes a quite different tack. \n\nS2. Anything that differs minutely from a typical cloud is a\ncloud. \n\nS3. ok differs minutely from\noj. \n\nC. ok is a cloud. \n\nSince we only care about the conditional if oj\nis a cloud, so is ok, it is clearly acceptable to\nassume that oj is a cloud for the sake of the\nargument. And S3 is guaranteed to be true by the set up of the problem.\nThe main issue then is whether S2 is true. As Hudson notes, there\nappear to be some clear counterexamples to it. The fusion of a cloud\nwith one of the water droplets in my bathtub is clearly not a cloud,\nbut by most standards it differs minutely from a cloud, since there is\nonly one droplet of water difference between them. \n\nThe final argument is not set out as clearly, but it has perhaps the\nmost persuasive force. Unger says that if exactly one of the\noi is a cloud, then there must be a\n‘selection principle’ that picks it over the others. But it\nis not clear just what kind of selection principle that could be. The\nunderlying argument seems to be something like this: \n\nM2. If oj is a cloud and ok\nis not, then there must be something that makes it the case that\noj is a cloud and ok is\nnot. \n\nM3. There is nothing that could make it the case that\noj is a cloud and ok is\nnot. \n\nC. ok is a cloud. \n\nThe idea behind M2 is that the only way our word ‘cloud’\ncould pick out a property that oj has and\nok does not is if either we intend it to pick out\nsuch a property, or some such property is a natural kind. But it seems\nthat oj instantiates no natural kinds that\nok does not, and that we have no intentional\nattitudes towards oj as opposed to\nok, so we could not have intended the word\n‘cloud’ to pick out a property satisfied by\noj as opposed to ok. \n\nIt is at this point that theories of\n vagueness\n can play a role in the debate. Two\nof the leading theories of vagueness, epistemicism and\nsupervaluationism, provide principled reasons to reject M2. The\nepistemicist says that there are semantic facts that are beyond our\npossible knowledge. Arguably we can only know where a semantic boundary\nlies if that boundary was fixed by our use or by the fact that one\nparticular property is a natural kind. But, say the epistemicists,\nthere are many other boundaries that are not like this, such as the\nboundary between the heaps and the non-heaps. Here we have a similar\nkind of situation. It is vague just which of the oi\nis a cloud. What that means is that there is a fact about which of them\nis a cloud, but we cannot possibly know it. It might be thought that\nthis is not so much a response to the argument above as a straight-out\ndenial of one of its premises. And since we have to appeal to the most\ncontentious feature of epistemicism, that there are these brute\nsemantic facts that are beyond our epistemic access, some may doubt its\nplausibility. Weatherson 2003a argues that this problem becomes\nmore pressing when one applies epistemicism to the Problem of\nthe Many than when one merely wields epistemicism to solve the\n Sorites Paradox.\n However, epistemicism\nis a well developed research program that provides a coherent framework\nfor thinking about vagueness. If, on the balance of considerations,\nepistemicism is thought to be the right theory of vagueness, then it is\nfair to simply deny M2, and say it could be a brute semantic fact that\noj satisfies ‘cloud’ and\nok does not. \n\nThe supervaluational response is more interesting, both because it\nengages directly with the intuitions behind this argument, and because\ntwo of its leading proponents (Vann McGee and Brian McLaughlin, in\ntheir 2001) have responded directly to this argument using the\nsupervaluational framework. Roughly (and for more detail see the\nsection on supervaluations in the  entry on\n vagueness)\n supervaluationists say that\nwhenever some terms are vague, there are ways of making them more\nprecise consistent with our intuitions on how the terms behave. So, to\nuse a classic case, ‘heap’ is vague, which to the\nsupervaluationist means that there are some piles of sand that are\nneither determinately heaps nor determinately non-heaps, and a sentence\nsaying that that object is a heap is neither determinately true nor\ndeterminately false. However, there are many ways to extend\nthe meaning of ‘heap’ so it becomes precise. Each of these\nways of making it precise is called a precisification. A\nprecisification is admissible iff every sentence that is\ndeterminately true (false) in English is true (false) in the\nprecisification. So if a is determinately a heap, b\nis determinately not a heap and c is neither determinately a\nheap nor determinately not a heap, then every precisification must make\n‘a is a heap’ true and ‘b is a\nheap’ false, but some make ‘c is a heap’\ntrue and others make it false. To a first approximation, to be\nadmissible a precisification must assign all the determinate heaps to\nthe extension of ‘heap’ and assign none of the determinate\nnon-heaps to its extension, but it is free to assign or not assign\nthings in the ‘penumbra’ between these groups to the\nextension of ‘heap’. But this is not quite right. If\nd is a little larger than c, but still not\ndeterminately a heap, then the sentence “If c is a heap\nso is d” is intuitively true. As it is often put,\nfollowing Kit Fine (1975), a precisification must respect\n‘penumbral connections’ between the borderline cases. If\nd has a better case for being a heap than c, then a\nprecisification cannot make c a heap but not d. These\npenumbral connections play a crucial role in the supervaluationist\nsolution to the Problem of the Many. Finally, a sentence is\ndeterminately true iff it is true on all admissible precisifications,\ndeterminately false iff it is false on all admissible\nprecisifications. \n\nIn the original example, described by Lewis, the sentence\n“There is one cloud in the sky” is determinately true. None\nof the sentences “o1 is a cloud”,\n“o2 is a cloud” and so on are\ndeterminately true. So a precisification can make each of these either\ntrue or false. But, if it is to preserve the fact that “There is\none cloud in the sky” is determinately true, it must make exactly\none of those sentences true. McGee and McLaughlin suggest that\nthis combination of constraints lets us preserve what is plausible\nabout M2, without accepting that it is true. The term\n‘cloud’ is vague; there is no fact of the matter as to\nwhether its extension includes o1 or\no2 or o3 or …. If there\nwere such a fact, there would have to be something that made it the\ncase that it included oj and not\nok, and as M3 correctly points out, no such facts\nexist. But this is consistent with saying that its extension does\ncontain exactly one of the oi. The beauty of the\nsupervaluationist solution is that it lets us hold these seemingly\ncontradictory positions simultaneously. We also get to capture some of\nthe plausibility of S2 - it is consistent with the supervaluational\nposition to say that anything similar to something that is\ndeterminately a paradigmatic cloud is a cloud. \n\nPenumbral connections also let us explain some other puzzling\nsituations. Imagine I point cloudwards and say, “That is a\ncloud”. Intuitively, what I have said is true, even though\n‘cloud’ is vague, and so is my demonstrative\n‘that’. (To see this, note that there's no determinate\nanswer as to which of the oi it picks out.) On\ndifferent precisifications, ‘that’ picks out different\noi. But on every precisification it picks out the\noi that is in the extension of ‘cloud’,\nso “That is a cloud” comes out true as desired. Similarly,\nif I named the cloud ‘Edgar’, then a similar trick lets it\nbe true that “Edgar” is vague, while “Edgar is a\ncloud” is determinately true. So the supervaluationist solution\nlets us preserve many of the intuitions about the original case,\nincluding the intuitions that seemed to underwrite M2, without\nconceding that there are millions of clouds. But there are a few\nobjections to this package. Reply: This may be true, but it would take us well beyond\nthe scope of this entry to outline them all. See the entries on\n vagueness\n (the section on supervaluation) \n and the\n Sorites Paradox\n for more detail. Reply: As Lewis says, this is odd, but no odder than\nthings that we learn to live with in other contexts. Lewis compares\nthis to, “I owe you a horse, but there is no particular horse\nthat I owe you.” Reply: It is true that the connections are not precisely\nspecified. It would be quite hard to carefully analyse\n‘cloud’ to work out exactly what they are. But that we\ncannot say exactly what the rules are is no reason for saying no such\nrules exist, any more than our inability to say exactly what knowledge\nis provides a reason for saying that no one ever knows anything.\nScepticism can't be proven that easily. Reply 1: We have to start somewhere in philosophy. This\nkind of reply can be spelled out in two ways. There is a\n‘Moorean’ move that says that the premise that there is one\ncloud in the sky is more plausible than the premises that would have to\nbe used in an argument against supervaluationism. Alternatively, it\nmight be claimed that the main argument for supervaluationism is an\ninference to the best explanation. In that case, the intuition that\nthere is exactly one cloud in the sky, but it is indeterminate just\nwhich object it is, is something to be explained, not something that\nhas to be proven. This is the kind of position defended by\nRosanna Keefe in her book Theories of Vagueness. Although\nKeefe does not apply this directly to the Problem of the Many,\nthe way to apply her position to the Problem seems clear enough. Reply 2: The penumbral connections we find for most words\nare generated by the inferential role provided by the meaning of the\nterms. It is because the inference from “This pile of sand is a\nheap”, and “That pile of sand is slightly larger than this\none, and arranged roughly the same way,” to “That pile of\nsand is a heap” is generally acceptable that precisifications\nwhich make the premises true and the conclusions false are\ninadmissible. (We have to restrict this inferential rule to the case\nwhere ‘this’ and ‘that’ are ordinary\ndemonstratives, and not used to pick out arbitrary fusions of grains,\nor else we get bizarre results for reasons that should be familiar by\nthis point in the story.) And it isn't too hard to specify the\ninferential rule here. The inference from “oj\nis a cloud” and “oj and\nok massively overlap” to\n“ok is not a cloud” is just as\nacceptable as the above inference involving heaps. Indeed, it is part\nof the meaning of ‘cloud’ that this inference is\nacceptable. (Much of this reply is drawn from the discussion of\n‘maximal’ predicates in Sider 2001 and 2003, though since\nSider is no supervaluationist, he would not entirely endorse this way\nof putting things.) Reply: One response to this would be to deny the view that\nnames and demonstratives are directly referential. Another would be to\ndeny that inferential roles provide the only penumbral\nconstraints on precisifications. Weatherson 2003b sketches a theory\nthat does exactly this. The theory draws on David Lewis's response to\nsome quite different work on semantic indeterminacy. As many authors\n(Quine 1960, Putnam 1981, Kripke 1982) showed, the dispositions of\nspeakers to use terms are not fine-grained enough to make the language\nas precise as we ordinarily think it is. As far as our usage\ndispositions go, ‘rabbit’ could mean undetached rabbit\npart, ‘vat’ could mean vat image, and ‘plus’\ncould mean quus. (Quus is a function defined over pairs of numbers that\nyields the sum of the two numbers when they are both small, and 5 when\none is sufficiently large.) But intuitively our language is not that\nindeterminate: ‘plus’ determinately does not mean quus. \n\nLewis (1983, 1984) suggested the way out here is to posit a notion\nof ‘naturalness’. Sometimes a term t denotes the\nconcept C1 rather than C2 not\nbecause we are disposed to use t as if it meant\nC1 rather than C2, but simply\nbecause C1 is a more natural concept.\n‘Plus’ means plus rather than quus simply because plus is\nmore natural than quus. Something like the same story applies to names\nand demonstratives. Imagine I point in the direction of Tibbles the cat\nand say, “That is Edgar's favourite cat.” There is a way of\nsystematically (mis)interpreting all my utterances so\n‘that’ denotes the Tibbles-shaped region of spacetime\nexactly one metre behind Tibbles. (We have to reinterpret what\n‘cat’ means to make this work, but the discussions of\nsemantic indeterminacy in Quine and Kripke make it clear how to do\nthis.) So there's nothing in my usage dispositions that makes\n‘that’ mean Tibbles, rather than the region of space time\nthat ‘follows’ him around. But because Tibbles is more\nnatural than that region of space time, ‘that’ does pick\nout Tibbles. It is the very same naturalness that makes\n‘cat’ denote a property that Tibbles (and not the trailing\nregion of space time) satisfies that makes ‘that’ denote\nTibbles, a fact that will become important below. \n\nThe same kind of story can be applied to the cloud. It is because\nthe cloud is a more natural object than the region of space time a mile\nabove the cloud that our demonstrative ‘that’ denotes the\ncloud and not the region. However, none of the oi\nare more natural than any other, so there is still no fact of the\nmatter as to whether ‘that’ picks out\noj or ok. Lewis's theory does\nnot eliminate all semantic indeterminacy; when there are equally\nnatural candidates to be the denotation of a term, and each of them is\nconsistent with our dispositions to use the term, then the denotation\nof the term is simply indeterminate between those candidates. \n\nWeatherson's theory is that the role of each precisification is to\narbitrarily make one of the oi more natural than\nthe rest. Typically, it is thought that the denotation of a term\naccording to a precisification is determined directly. It is a fact\nabout a precisification P that, according to it,\n‘cloud’ denotes property c1. On\nWeatherson's theory this is not the case. What the precisification does\nis provide a new, and somewhat arbitrary, standard of naturalness, and\nthe content of the terms according to the precisification is then\ndetermined by Lewis's theory of content. The denotations of\n‘cloud’ and ‘that’ according to a\nprecisification P are those concepts and objects that are the\nmost natural according to P of the concepts and objects that\nwe could be denoting by those terms, for all one can tell from the way\nthe terms are used. The coordination between the two terms, the fact\nthat on every precisification ‘that’ denotes an object in\nthe extension of ‘cloud’ is explained by the fact that the\nvery same thing, naturalness according to P, determines the\ndenotation of ‘cloud’ and of ‘that’. Reply: There is a little logical slip here. Let\nPi be a precisification of Sam's word\n‘that’ that makes it denote oi. All the\nsupervaluationist who holds that Sam's utterance is determinately true\nis committed to is that for each i, according to\nPi, Alex said that oi is a\ncloud. And this will be true if the denotation of Alex's word\n‘that’ is also oi according to\nPi. So as long as there is a penumbral connection\nbetween Sam's word ‘that’ and Alex's word\n‘that’, the supervaluationist avoids the objection. Such a\nconnection may seem mysterious at first, but note that Weatherson's\ntheory predicts that just such a penumbral connection obtains. So if\nthat theory is acceptable, then Schiffer's objection misfires. Reply: It is true that on any precisification there\nwill be no principled reason why this fusion of rocks is a mountain,\nand another is not. And it is true that there should be such a\nprincipled reason; mountainhood facts are not basic. But that problem\ncan be avoided by the theory that denies that “the\nsupervaluationist rule [applies] to any statement whatever, never mind\nthat the statement makes no sense that way” (Lewis 1993,\n173). Lewis's idea, or at least the application of Lewis's idea to\nthis puzzle, is that we know how to understand the idea that\nmountainhood facts are non-arbitrary: we understand it as a claim that\nthere is some non-arbitrary explanation of which precisifications of\n‘mountain’ are and are not admissible. If we must apply\nthe supervaluational rule to every statement, including the statement\nthat it is not arbitrary which things are mountains, this\nunderstanding is ruled out. Lewis's response is to deny that the rule\nmust always be applied. As long as there is some sensible way to\nunderstand the claim, we don't have to insist on applying the\nsupervaluationist machinery to it.  \nThat said, it does seem like this is likely to be somewhat of a\nproblem for everyone (even the theorist like Lewis who uses the\nsupervaluational machinery only when it is helpful). Sattig himself\nclaims to avoid the problem by making the mountain be a maximal fusion\nof candidates. But for any plausible mountain, it will be vague and\nsomewhat arbitrary what the boundary is between being a\nmountain-candidate and not being one. The lower boundaries of\nmountains are not, in practice, clearly marked. Similarly, there will\nbe some arbitrariness in the boundaries between the admissible and\ninadmissible precisifications of 'mountain'. We may have to live with\nsome arbitrariness. Reply: This is definitely a problem for the views that\nmany philosophers have put forward. As Williams stresses, it isn't on\nits own a problem for the vagueness solution to the Problem of the\nMany, but it is a problem for the conjunction of that solution with a\nwidely endorsed, and independently plausible, explanation of the\nSorites paradox. At this stage, i.e., as of 2014, there are no\npublished replies to Williams's argument. In his dissertation,\nNicholas K. Jones (2010) argues that the right response is to give up\nthe idea that speakers typically confuse Definitely, there is\nan F, with There is a definite F, and instead use a\ndifferent resolution of the Sorites.  \n\nSpace prevents a further discussion of all possible objections to\nthe supervaluationist account, but interested readers are particularly\nencouraged to look at Neil McKinnon's objection to the account (see the\nOther Internet Resources section), which suggests that distinctive\nproblems arise for the supervaluationist when there really are two or\nmore clouds involved. \n\nEven if the supervaluationist solution to the Problem of the Many\nhas responses to all of the objections that have been levelled against\nit, some of those objections rely on theories that are contentious\nand/or underdeveloped. So it is far from clear at this stage how well\nthe supervaluational solution, or indeed any solution based on\nvagueness, to the Problem of the Many will do in future years. \n\nSome theorists have argued that the underlying cause of the problem\nis that we have the wrong theory about the relation between parts and\nwholes. Peter van Inwagen (1990) argues that the problem is that we\nhave assumed that the parthood relation is determinate. We have assumed\nthat it is always determinately true or determinately false that one\nobject is a part of another. According to van Inwagen, sometimes\nneither of these options applies. He thinks that we need to adopt some\nkind of\n fuzzy logic\n when we are\ndiscussing parts and wholes. It can be true to degree 0.7, for example,\nthat one object is part of another. Given these resources, van Inwagen\nsays we are free to conclude that there is exactly one cloud in the\nsky, and that some of the ‘outer’ water droplets are true\nof it to a degree strictly between 0 and 1. This lets us keep the\nintuition that it is indeterminate whether these outlying water\ndroplets are members of the cloud without accepting that there are\nmillions of clouds. Note that this is not what van Inwagen would say\nabout this version of the paradox, since he holds that some\nsimples only constitute an object when that object is alive. For van\nInwagen, as for Unger, there are no clouds, only cloud-like swarms of\natoms. But van Inwagen recognises that a similar problem arises for\ncats, or for people, two kinds of things that he does believe exist and\nhe wields this vague constitution theory to solve the problems that\narise there. \n\nTraditionally, many philosophers thought that such a solution was\ndownright incoherent. A tradition stretching back to Bertrand Russell\n(1923) and Michael Dummett (1975) held that vagueness was always and\neverywhere a representational phenomenon. From this perspective, it\ndidn't make sense to talk about it being vague or indeterminate\nwhether a particular droplet was part of a particular cloud. But this\ntraditional view has come under a lot of pressure in recent years; see\nBarnes (2010) for one of the best challenges, and Sorensen (2013,\nsection 8) for a survey of more work. So I'll assume here it is\nlegitimate to talk about the possibility that parthood itself, and not\njust our representation of it, is vague.\n\nAs Hudson (2001) notes though, it is far from clear just how the appeal to\nfuzzy logic is meant to help here. Originally it was clear for\neach of n water droplets whether they were members of the\ncloud to degree 1 or degree 0. So there were 2n\ncandidate clouds, and the Problem of the Many is finding out how to\npreserve the intuition when faced with all these objects. It is unclear\nhow increasing the range of possible relationships between\neach particle and the cloud from 2 to continuum-many should help here,\nfor now it seems there are at least continuum-many cloud-like objects\nto choose between, one for each function from each of the n\ndroplets to [0, 1], and we need a way of saying exactly one of\nthem is a cloud. When van Inwagen addresses an objection like this one,\nhe solves it by saying that not every function will correspond to an\nobject. That is, he appeals to something like brute composition,\nalthough in this case it is mixed with fuzzy logic. But it is the\nbruteness not the fuzziness that does the philosophical work. So it\ndoes not look like this solution is any better than Markosian's brutal\ncomposition solution, and may even be worse given the contentious\nappeal to fuzzy logic. \n\nA different kind of solution is offered by Mark Johnston (1992) and\nE. J. Lowe (1982, 1995). Both of them suggest that the key to solving\nthe Problem is to distinguish cloud-constituters from clouds. They say\nit is a category mistake to identify clouds with any fusion of water\ndroplets, because they have different identity conditions. The cloud\ncould survive the transformation of half its droplets into puddles on\nthe footpath (or whatever kind of land it happens to be raining over),\nit would just be a smaller cloud, the fusion could not. As Johnston\nsays, “Hence Unger's insistent and ironic question ‘But\nwhich of o1, o2,\no3, … is our paradigm cloud\nc?’ has as its proper answer ‘None’.”\n(1992: 100, numbering slightly altered). \n\nLewis (1993) listed several objections to this position, and Lowe\n(1995) responds to them. (Lewis and Lowe discuss a version of the\nproblem using cats not clouds, and I will sometimes follow them\nbelow.) \n\nLewis's first objection is that it positing clouds as well as\ncloud-constituting fusions of atoms is metaphysically extravagant. As\nLowe (and, for separate reasons, Johnston) point out, these extra\nobjects are arguably needed to solve puzzles to do with persistence.\nHence it is no objection to a solution to the Problem of the Many that\nit posits such objects. Resolving these debates would take us too far\nafield, so I will assume (as Lewis does) that we have reason to believe\nthat these objects exist. \n\nSecondly, Lewis says that even with this move, we still have a\nProblem of the Many applied to cloud-constituters, rather than to\nclouds. Lowe responds that since ‘cloud-constituter’ is not\na folk concept, we don't really have any philosophically salient\nintuitions here, so this cannot be a way in which the position is\nunintuitive. \n\nFinally, Lewis says that each of the constituters is so like the\nobject it is meant to merely constitute (be it a cloud, or a cat, or\nwhatever), it satisfies the same sortals as that object. So if we were\noriginally worried that there were 1001 cats (or clouds) where we\nthought there were one, now we should be worried that there are 1002.\nBut as Lowe points out, this argument seems to assume that being a\ncat, or being a cloud is an intrinsic property. If we\nassume that it is extrinsic, if it turns on the history of the object,\nperhaps its future or its possible future, and on which object it is\nembedded in, then the fact that a cloud-constituter looks, when\nconsidered in isolation, to be a cloud is little reason to think it\nactually is a cloud. \n\nJohnston provides an argument that the distinction between clouds\nand cloud-constituting fusions of water droplets is crucial to solving\nthe Problem. He thinks that the following principle is sound, and not\nthreatened by examples like our cloud. \n\nThe theorist who thinks that clouds are just fusions of water\ndroplets cannot accept this principle, or they will conclude that every\noi is a cloud, since for them each\noi is of the right category. On the other hand,\nJohnston himself cannot accept it either unless he denies there can be\nanother object c´ which is in a similar position to\nc, and is of the same category as c, but differs with\nrespect to which water droplets constitute it. It seems that what is\ndoing the work in Johnston's solution is not just the distinction\nbetween constitution and identity, but a tacit restriction on when\nthere is a ‘higher-level’ object constituted by certain\n‘lower-level’ objects. To that extent, his theory also\nresembles Markosian's brutal composition theory, though since Johnston\ncan accept that every set of atoms has a fusion his theory has\ndifferent costs and benefits to Markosian's theory. \n\nAfter concluding that all of these solutions face serious\ndifficulties, Hudson (2001: Chapter 2) outlines a new solution, one\nwhich rejects so many of the presuppositions of the puzzle that it is\nbest to count him as rejecting the reasoning, rather than rejecting any\nparticular premise. (Hudson is somewhat tentative about\nendorsing this view, as opposed to merely endorsing the claim\nthat it looks better than its many rivals, but for expository purposes\nI'll refer to it here as his view.) To see the motivation behind\nHudson's approach, consider a slightly different case, a variant of one\ndiscussed in Wiggins 1968. Tibbles is born at midnight Sunday, replete\nwith a splendid tail, called Tail. An unfortunate accident involving a\nguillotine sees Tibbles lose his tail at midday Monday, though the tail\nis preserved for posterity. Then midnight Monday, Tibbles dies. Now\nconsider the timeless question, “Is Tail part of Tibbles?”\nIntuitively, we want to say the question is underspecified. Outside of\nMonday, the question does not arise, for Tibbles does not exist. Before\nmidday Monday, the answer is “Yes”, and after midday the\nanswer is “No”. This suggests that there is really no\nproposition that Tail is part of Tibbles. There is a proposition that\nTail is part of Tibbles on Monday morning (that's true) and that Tail\nis part of Tibbles on Monday afternoon (that's false), but no\nproposition involving just the parthood relation and two objects.\nParthood is a three-place relation between two objects and a time, not\na two-place relation between two objects. \n\nHudson suggests that this line of reasoning is potentially on the\nright track, but that the conclusion is not quite right. Parthood is a\nthree-place relation, but the third place is not filled by a time, but\nby a region of space-time. To a crude approximation, x is part\nof y at s is true if (as we'd normally say),\nx is a part of y and s is a region of\nspacetime containing no region not occupied by y and all\nregions occupied by x. But this should be taken as a heuristic\nguide only, not as a reductive definition, since parthood is really a\nthree-place relation, so the crude approximation does not even express\na proposition according to Hudson. \n\nTo see how this applies to the Problem of the Many, let's simplify\nthe case a little bit so there are only two water droplets,\nw1 and w2, that are neither\ndeterminately part of the cloud nor determinately not a part of it. As\nwell there is the core of the cloud, call it a. On an orthodox\ntheory, there are four proto-clouds here, a,\na + w1,\na + w2 and\na + w1 + w\n2. On Hudson's theory the largest and the smallest proto-clouds\nstill exist, but in the middle there is a quite different kind of\nobject, which we'll call c. Let r1 be the\nregion occupied by a and w1, and\nr2 the region occupied by a and\nw2. Then the following claims are all true\naccording to Hudson: \n\nHudson defines x exactly occupies s as follows:  \n\nAt first, it might look like not much has been accomplished here.\nAll that we did was turn a Problem of 4 clouds into a Problem of 3\nclouds, replacing the fusions\na + w1 and\na + w2 with the new, and oddly\nbehaved, c. But that is to overlook a rather important feature\nof the remaining proto-clouds. The three remaining proto-clouds can be\nstrictly ordered by the ‘part of’ relation. This was not\npreviously possible, since neither\na + w1 nor\na + w2 were part of the other.\nIf we adopt the principle that ‘cloud’ is a maximal\npredicate, so no cloud can be a proper part of another cloud, we now\nget the conclusion that there is exactly one of the proto-clouds is a\ncloud, as desired. \n\nThis is a quite ingenious approach, and it deserves some attention\nin the future literature. It is hard to say what will emerge as the\nmain costs and benefits of the view in advance of that literature, but\nthe following two points seem worthy of attention. First, if we are\nallowed to appeal to the principle that no cloud is a proper part of\nanother, why not appeal to the principle that no two clouds massively\noverlap, and get from 4 proto-clouds to one actual cloud that way?\nSecondly, why don't we have an object that is just like the old\na + w1, that is, an object that\nhas w1 as a part at r1, and\ndoes not have w2 (or anything else) as a part at\nr2? If we get it back, as well as\na + w2, then all of Hudson's\ntinkering with mereology will just have converted a problem of 4 clouds\ninto a problem of 5 clouds. \n\nNeither of these points should be taken to be conclusive\nrefutations. As things stand now, Hudson's solution joins the ranks of\nthe many and varied proposed solutions to the Problem of the Many. For\nsuch a young problem, the variety of these solutions is rather\nimpressive. Whether the next few years will see these ranks whittled\ndown by refutation, or swelled by imaginative theorising, remains to be\nseen.","contact.mail":"brian@weatherson.org","contact.domain":"weatherson.org"}]
