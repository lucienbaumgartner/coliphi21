The objects the\nworld contains, together with their properties and the relations they\nenter into, fix the world’s nature and these objects [together\nwith the properties they have and the relations they enter into] exist\nindependently of our ability to discover they do. Unless this is so,\nmetaphysical realists argue, none of our beliefs about our world could\nbe objectively true since true beliefs tell us how things are and\nbeliefs are objective when true or false independently of what anyone\nmight think.\n\n\nMany philosophers believe metaphysical realism is just plain common\nsense. Others believe it to be a direct implication of modern science,\nwhich paints humans as fallible creatures adrift in an inhospitable\nworld not of their making. Nonetheless, metaphysical realism is\ncontroversial. Besides the analytic question of what it means to\nassert that objects exist independently of the mind, metaphysical\nrealism also raises epistemological problems: how can we obtain\nknowledge of a mind-independent world? There are also prior semantic\nproblems, such as how links are set up between our beliefs and the\nmind-independent states of affairs they allegedly represent. This is\nthe Representation Problem.\n\n\nAnti-realists deny the world is mind-independent. Believing the\nepistemological and semantic problems to be insoluble, they conclude\nrealism must be false. The first anti-realist arguments based on\nexplicitly semantic considerations were advanced by Michael Dummett\nand Hilary Putnam. These are:\n\nDummett’s Manifestation Argument: the cognitive and\nlinguistic behaviour of an agent provides no evidence that realist\nmind/world links exist;\n\nDummett’s Language Acquisition Argument: if such links were\nto exist language learning would be impossible;\n\nPutnam’s Brain-in-a-Vat Argument: realism entails both that\nwe could be massively deluded (‘brains in a vat’) and that\nif we were we could not even form the belief that we were;\n\nPutnam’s Conceptual Relativity Argument: it is senseless to\nask what the world contains independently of how we conceive of it,\nsince the objects that exist depend on the conceptual scheme used to\nclassify them;\n\nPutnam’s Model-Theoretic Argument: realists must either hold\nthat an ideal theory passing every conceivable test could be false or\nthat perfectly determinate terms like ‘cat’ are massively\nindeterminate, and both alternatives are absurd.\n\nWe’ll proceed by first defining metaphysical realism,\nillustrating its distinctive mind-independence claim with some\nexamples and distinguishing it from other doctrines with which it is\noften confused, in particular factualism. We’ll then outline the\nRepresentation Problem in the course of presenting the anti-realist\nchallenges to metaphysical realism that are based on it. We discuss\nmetaphysical realist responses to these challenges, indicating how the\ndebates have proceeded, suggesting various alternatives and\ncountenancing anti-realist replies. We finish with a brief review of\nrecent realist/anti-realist debates in meta-ontology.\n\nMetaphysical realism is the thesis that the objects, properties and\nrelations the world contains, collectively: the structure of the world\n[Sider 2011], exists independently of our thoughts about it or our\nperceptions of it. Anti-realists either doubt or deny the existence of\nthe structure the metaphysical realist believes in or else doubt or\ndeny its independence from our conceptions of it. Realists about\nnumbers, for example, hold that numbers exist mind-independently. This\nview is opposed by Nominalists who deny the existence of abstract\nobjects and Intuitionists who agree numbers exist, but as mental\nconstructions, denying their mind-independence. Some realists about\nlaws of nature, to take an empirical example, hold that laws are\nrelations between universals [Armstrong 1983], others that laws are\nontologically primitive entities [Maudlin 2007]. Anti-realists about\nlaws of nature, on the other hand, either deny there are any laws at\nall [Cartwright 1983; van Fraassen 1989] or else discern a dependence\non human concepts in the nature of these laws, interpreting them as\nexpressing certain expectations we have about regularities that we\nunconsciously project onto the world [Blackburn 1986].  \nMetaphysical realism is not the same as scientific realism. That the\nworld’s constituents exist mind-independently does not entail\nthat its constituents are as science portrays them. One could adopt an\ninstrumentalist attitude toward the theoretical entities posited by\nscience, continuing to believe that whatever entities the world\nactually does contain exist independently of our conceptions and\nperceptions of them. For the same reason, metaphysical realists need\nnot accept that the entities and structures ontologists posit exist\nmind-independently. \nHenceforth, we shall often just use the term ‘realism’ to\nmean metaphysical realism. Opposition to realism can take many forms\nso there is no single theoretical view denoted by the term\n‘anti-realism’. In particular, anti-realism is not\nIdealism, even though Idealism is its most recognised form. One\napproach, popular in Continental Philosophy, rejects realism on the\ngrounds that words can only acquire their meaning\nintra-linguistically, through their semantic relations with\nother words, where these relations are grounded in our linguistic and\ncultural practices, rather than through referential relations to the\nworld outside of language. This view, Anti-Representationalism as it\nis sometimes called, has gained traction in analytic philosophy also\n[See Price 2009].  \nWithin the ranks of Analytic Philosophy, Verificationists and\nPragmatists also reject realism, though for different reasons. We\nshall mainly focus in this entry on the types of criticism voiced by\nthese two groups of Analytic philosophers with Michael Dummett\nadvocating a certain kind of Verificationism and Hilary Putnam a\ncertain kind of Pragmatism. While accepting Representationalism, both\nDummett and Putnam rejected realism by deploying semantic\nconsiderations in arguments designed to show that realism is\nuntenable. The main goal of this entry is to outline these\n‘semantic’ challenges to realism and to review realist\nresponses to them. \nThe characterization of realism in terms of mind-independence above is\nnot universally accepted. Some object that mind-independence is\nobscure [e.g. Chalmers 2009; for relevant discussion, see the entry\n ontological dependence].\n Others maintain that realism is committed, in addition, to a\ndistinctive (and tendentious) conception of truth [Putnam 1981, 1985,\n1992; Wright 1993; Button 2013; Taylor 2006] or, more radically, that\nrealism just is a thesis about the nature of truth—that truth\ncan transcend the possibility of verification, ruling statements for\nwhich we can gather no evidence one way or the other to be\ndeterminately either true or false. An example would be “Julius\nCaesar’s heart skipped a beat as he crossed the Rubicon.”\nThus the realist on this view is one who believes the law of bivalence\n(every statement is either true or false) holds for all meaningful\n(non-vague) statements [Dummett 1978, 1991, 1993].  \nIn the same vein, Crispin Wright [1992a, 2003] presents a nuanced\nalethic analysis according to which discourses may be more or less\nrealist depending on which distinctive ‘marks of truth’\nthey satisfy.  \nThese semantic formulations of metaphysical realism are unacceptable\nto realists who are deflationists about truth, denying that truth is a\nsubstantive notion that can be used to characterise alternative\nmetaphysical views [see the entry on the\n deflationary theory of truth].\n Realists collectively complain, with some justice, that the\nanti-realist arguments are really arguments against the correspondence\n(or other substantive) theory of truth rather than realism [Devitt\n1983, 1991; Millikan 1986]. This is an important reason for preferring\nan ontological construal of realism rather than a semantic one.  \nThere is, in fact, an obvious worry about using the notion of\nmind-independence to characterise realism: it appears to consign\nmental states and events to irreality. Surely your savouring the taste\nof espresso, say, is dependent on your mind if anything is? Moreover,\njust as certainly the nature and content of the experience of tasting\nespresso depends upon one’s beliefs and expectations. Indeed,\nbut this is not what the ‘mind-independence’\ncharacterisation of realism means to exclude. Rather, it is the\nexistence of conscious events that is deemed to be\nindependent of the particular opinions or theories we might hold about\ntheir existence —given conscious events do exist, were our\ndescendants to uniformly dismiss them as illusory, they would be\nmistaken. The ‘mind-independence’ at issue is epistemic\nrather than ontological. \nOn this understanding of realism, it is an error to identify realism\nwith factualism, the view that sentences in some discourse or theory\nare to be construed literally as fact-stating ones. The anti-realist\nviews discussed below are factualist about discourse describing\ncertain contentious domains. Adopting a non-factualist or\nerror-theoretic interpretation of some domain of discourse commits one\nto anti-realism about its entities. Factualism is thus a necessary\ncondition for realism. But it is not sufficient. Verificationists such\nas Dummett reject the idea that something might exist without our\nbeing able to recognize its existence. They can be factualists about\nentities such as numbers and quarks while anti-realists about their\nnature since they deny any entities can exist mind-independently. \nTo elaborate the notion of mind-independent existence, consider Peter\nvan Inwagen’s argument for the existence of numbers [van Inwagen\n2016], which he describes as “a typical neo-Quinean\nargument”. The argument rests on two Quinean theses, van Inwagen\nrelays. Firstly, that there is only one kind of variable, a variable\nthat occupies nominal position, the range of which is unrestricted.\nSecondly, that the meanings of the quantifiers are\n univocal.[1] \nGiven these two background assumptions, the argument he gives is this:\n \n(3) follows from (1) and (2), with the conclusion (5) deducible from\n(1), (2) and (4). Moreover, both (2) and (4) are, if not analytically\ntrue, simple mathematical truths. (1), on the other hand, is an\nempirical fact, van Inwagen notes. The argument is clearly valid and\nthe three premises that support the conclusion are all highly\nplausible. Should we not just accept that numbers exist? Many\nphilosophers think so but some philosophers demur. Amongst the latter\nare those who think that the meaning of ‘there exists’\nvaries from context to context [Hilary Putnam and Eli Hirsch are two\nprominent advocates whose ideas we review]. There are others who think\nthat the existential quantifier carries no ontological import\n[Azzouni, J. 1997]. If one accepts Quine’s two assumptions about\nthe existential quantifier, however, and regards the argument as\nsound, hasn’t one thereby accepted realism about numbers?  \nNo. For, while the argument establishes the existence of numbers, if\nit is indeed sound, it leaves their nature unspecified. Hence, it does\nnot prove that numbers exist independently of human (or other) minds.\nMoreover, since the inferences are intuitionistically valid,\nanti-realists can accept it. The argument gives Intuitionists who\nbelieve numbers are mental constructs just as much as Platonists who\nbelieve they are eternal abstract objects a reason to believe numbers\nexist.  \nWhy do some find the notion of mind-independent existence inadequate\nfor the task of formulating metaphysical realism? The most common\ncomplaint is that the notion is either obscure, or, more strongly,\nincoherent or cognitively meaningless. An eloquent spokesman for this\nstrong view was Rudolf Carnap: “My friends and I have maintained\nthe following theses,” Carnap announces [Carnap 1963,\np.868]: \nIn spite of his finding these disputes meaningless, Carnap indicates\nhow he thinks we could reconstruct them (sic.) so as to make some\nsense of them: if we were to “replace the ontological theses\nabout the reality or irreality of certain entities, theses which we\nregard as pseudo-theses, by proposals or decisions concerning the use\nof certain languages. Thus realism is replaced by the practical\ndecision to use the reistic language”. \nCarnap does not have in mind a factualist reformulation of\nmetaphysical realism here—his “reistic” language is\nstrictly limited to the description of “intersubjectively\nobservable, spatio-temporally localized things or events”. \nWhat matters here is not Carnap’s sense of a commensurability\nbetween a metaphysical thesis about reality and a practical decision\nto speak only about observable things, but rather that he thinks he\ncan explain how the illusion of meaningfulness arises for the\nmetaphysical theses he declares “devoid of cognitive\ncontent”. His explanation has to do with a distinction between\ntwo types of questions — internal and external\nquestions:  \nWhereas internal questions about the existence of physical objects are\nto be answered by observations that confirm or disconfirm sentences\nasserting their existence, existential statements about abstract\nobjects are analytic, Carnap contends: \nHaving dismissed all external existential questions as devoid of\ncognitive content, Carnap decides that both realism which asserts the\nontological reality of abstract entities and nominalism which asserts\ntheir irreality are “pseudo-statements if they claim to be\ntheoretical statements” (ibid). \nWhere Carnap could make no sense of the notion of mind-independent\nreality, Albert Einstein had no such difficulty. For, together with\nPodolsky and Rosen, Einstein famously proposed a test for elements of\nreality in their EPR paper [Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen 1935:\n777–8]: \nTim Maudlin [2014, p.7] explains the significance of the EPR criterion\nthus: \nRealists might wish to endorse the EPR criterion as an idealized test\nfor the mind-independent reality of (macro-)physical quantities\n— even if we rarely (if at all) are able to “predict with\ncertainty” the outcome of an experiment, we can, some would\nargue, approach near-certainty in a significant class of cases without\ndisturbing the system. Carnapian anti-realists, however, will deny the\nEPR criterion validates any external notion of mind-independent\nexistence, regarding it instead as a means of settling internal\nexistence questions about physical quantities. \nThe first anti-realist challenge to consider focuses on the use we\nmake of our words and sentences. The challenge is simply this: what\naspect of our linguistic use could provide the necessary evidence for\nthe realist’s correlation between sentences and mind-independent\nstates of affairs? Which aspects of our semantic behaviour manifest\nour grasp of these correlations, assuming they do hold? \nFor your representations of the world to be reliable, there must be a\ncorrelation between these representations and the states of affairs\nthey portray. So the cosmologist who utters the statement “the\nentropy of the Big Bang was remarkably low” has uttered a truth\nif and only if the entropy of the Big Bang was remarkably low. \nA natural question to ask is how the correlation between the statement\nand the mind-independent state of affairs which makes it true is\nsupposed to be set up. One suggestive answer is that the link is\neffected by the use speakers make of their words, the statements they\nendorse and the statements they dissent from, the rationalizations\nthey provide for their actions and so forth; cognitively, it will be\nthe functional role of mental symbols in thought, perception and\nlanguage learning etc. that effects these links. \nHowever, when we look at how speakers actually do use their sentences,\nanti-realists argue, we see them responding not to states of affairs\nthat they cannot in general detect but rather to agreed upon\nconditions for asserting these sentences. Scientists assert “the\nentropy of the Big Bang was remarkably low” because they all\nconcur that the conditions justifying this assertion have been\nmet. \nWhat prompts us to use our sentences in the way that we do are the\npublic justification conditions associated with those sentences,\njustification conditions forged in linguistic practices which imbue\nthese sentences with meaning. \nThe realist believes we are able to mentally represent\nmind-independent states of affairs. But what of cases where everything\nthat we know about the world leaves it unsettled whether the relevant\nstate of affairs obtains? Did Socrates sneeze in his sleep the night\nbefore he took the hemlock or did he not? How could we possibly find\nout? Yet realists hold that the sentence “Socrates sneezed in\nhis sleep the night before he took the hemlock” will be true if\nSocrates did sneeze then and false if he did not and that this is a\nsignificant semantic fact. \nThe Manifestation challenge to realism is to isolate some feature of\nthe use agents make of their words, or their mental symbols, which\nforges the link between mind-independent states of affairs and the\nthoughts and sentences that represent them. Nothing in the\nthinker’s linguistic behaviour, according to the anti-realist,\nprovides evidence that this link has been forged—linguistic use\nis keyed to public assertibility conditions, not undetectable\ntruth-conditions. In those cases, such as the Socrates one, where we\ncannot find out whether the truth-condition is satisfied or not, it is\nsimply gratuitous to believe that there is anything we can think or\nsay or do which could provide evidence that the link has been set up\nin the first place. So the anti-realist claims [Dummett 1978, 1991,\n1993; Tennant 1987, 1997; Wright 1993]. \nWhy should we expect the evidence to be behavioural rather than, say,\nneurophysiological? The reason anti-realists give is that the meanings\nof our words and (derivatively for them) the contents of our thoughts\nare essentially communicable and thus must be open for all speakers\nand thinkers to see [Dummett 1978, 1993]. \nThe second challenge to be considered concerns our acquisition of\nlanguage. The challenge to realism is to explain how a child could\ncome to know the meanings of certain sentences within his/her\nlanguage: the ones which the realist contends have undetectable\ntruth-makers associated with them. How could the child learn the\nmeanings of such sentences if these meanings are determined by states\nof affairs not even competent speakers can detect? \nConsider the sentence (S) once more: \nRealists say (S) is either true or false even though we may (and\nalmost certainly will) never know which it is. The state of affairs\nwhich satisfies (S)’s truth-condition when it is true, its\n‘truthmaker’, and the state of affairs which satisfies the\ntruth-condition of the negation of (S) when (S) is false are supposed\nto be able to hold even though competent speakers cannot detect\nwhether they do. How could the child ever learn about this\nundetectable relation? \nSuppose God (or nature) had linked our mental representations to just\nthe right states of affairs in the way required by the realist. If so,\nthis is a semantically significant fact. Anyone learning their native\nlanguage would have to grasp these correspondences between sentences\nand states of affairs. How can they do this if even the competent\nspeakers whom they seek to emulate cannot detect when these\ncorrespondences hold? In short, competence in one’s language\nwould be impossible to acquire if realism were true [Dummett 1978,\n1993; Wright 1993]. This is the Language Acquisition challenge. \nThis challenge is exacerbated by the anti-realist’s assumption\nthat since the linguistic meaning of an expression \\(E\\) is determined\nsolely by competent speakers’ use of \\(E\\) the child’s\ntask in all cases is to infer the meaning of \\(E\\) from its use. Thus\nDummett [1978 pp. 216–217], in discussing the meaning of\nmathematical statements, proposes a thesis he argues holds for the\nmeanings of every kind of statement: \nThe meaning of a mathematical statement determines and is exhaustively\ndetermined by its use. The meaning of a mathematical statement cannot\nbe, or contain as an ingredient, anything which is not manifest in the\nuse made of it, lying solely in the mind of the individual who\napprehends that meaning: if two individual agree completely about the\nuse to be made of the statement, then they agree about its meaning.\nThe reason is that the meaning of a statement consists solely in its\nrole as an instrument of communication between individuals, just as\nthe powers of a chess-piece consist solely in its role in the game\naccording to the rules. \nW.V.O. Quine is even more insistent on the public nature of linguistic\nmeaning. Displaying his unshakable faith in Skinnerian models of\nlanguage-learning he writes [1992, pp. 37–38]: \nAccording to Hilary Putnam, the metaphysical realist subscribes not\njust to the belief in a mind-independent world but also to the thesis\nthat truth consists in a correspondence relation between words (or\nmental symbols) and things in that mind-independent world. Call this\nthesis correspondence truth (after Devitt 1991). More\nimportantly, metaphysical realists aver that an ideal theory of the\nworld could be radically false, Putnam contends:\n‘radical’ in the sense that all (or\nalmost all) of the theory’s theses could fail to hold. Such a\nglobal failure would result if we were to be\n‘brains-in-a-vat’ our brains manipulated by mad scientists\n(or machines, as in the movie The Matrix) so as to dream of\nan external world that we mistake for reality. Call this thesis\nradical skepticism. \nIt is widely believed that states of affairs that are truly\nmind-independent do engender radical skepticism. The skeptic contends\nthat for all we could tell we could be brains in a vat—brains\nkept alive in a bath of nutrients by mad alien scientists. All our\nthoughts, all our experience, all that passed for science would be\nsystematically mistaken if we were. We’d have no bodies although\nwe thought we did, the world would contain no physical objects, yet it\nwould seem to us that it did, there’d be no Earth, no Sun, no\nvast universe, only the brain’s deluded representations of such.\nAt least this could be the case if our representations derived even\npart of their content from links with mind-independent objects and\nstates of affairs. Since realism implies that such an absurd\npossibility could hold without our being able to detect it, it has to\nbe rejected, according to anti-realists. \nA much stronger anti-realist argument due to Putnam uses the\nbrain-in-a-vat hypothesis to show that realism is internally\nincoherent rather than, as before, simply false. A crucial assumption\nof the argument is semantic externalism, the thesis that the reference\nof our words and mental symbols is partially determined by contingent\nrelations between thinkers and the world. This is a semantic\nassumption many realists independently endorse. \nGiven semantic externalism, the argument proceeds by claiming that if\nwe were brains in a vat we could not possibly have the thought that we\nwere. For, if we were so envatted, we could not possibly mean by\n‘brain’ and ‘vat’ what unenvatted folk mean by\nthese words since our words would be connected only to neural impulses\nor images in our brains where the unenvatteds’ words are\nconnected to real-life brains and real-life vats. Similarly, the\nthought we pondered whenever we posed the question “am I a brain\nin a vat?” could not possibly be the thought unenvatted folk\npose when they ask themselves the same-sounding question in English.\nBut realism entails that we could indeed be brains in a vat. As we\nhave just shown that were we to be so, we could not even entertain\nthis as a possibility, Putnam concludes that realism is incoherent\n[Putnam 1981]. For this argument to work, however, Putnam must be\nassuming a rather restrictive form of modal rationalism: we could be\nbrains in a vat only if in the circumstance that we were envatted, we\ncould conceive that we were envatted. \nPutnam’s Model-Theoretic Argument is the most technical of the\narguments we have so far considered although we shall not reproduce\nall the technicalities here. The central ideas can be conveyed\ninformally, although some technical concepts will be mentioned where\nnecessary. The argument purports to show that the Representation\nProblem—to explain how our mental symbols and words get hooked\nup to mind-independent objects and how our sentences and thoughts\ntarget mind-independent states of affairs—is insoluble. \nAccording to the Model-Theoretic Argument, there are simply too many\nways in which our mental symbols can be mapped onto items in the\nworld. The consequence of this is a dilemma for the realist. The first\nhorn of the dilemma is that s/he must accept that what our symbols\nrefer to is massively indeterminate. The second horn is that s/he must\ninsist that even an ideal theory, whose terms and predicates can\ndemonstrably be mapped veridically onto objects and properties in the\nworld might still be false, i.e., that such a mapping might not be the\nright one, the one ‘intended’. \nNeither alternative can be defended, according to anti-realists.\nConcerning the first alternative, massive indeterminacy for perfectly\ndeterminate terms is absurd. As for the second, for realists to\ncontend that even an ideal theory could be false is to resort to\nunmotivated dogmatism, since on their own admission we cannot tell\nwhich mapping the world has set up for us. Such dogmatism leaves the\nrealist with no answer to a skepticism which undermines any capacity\nto reliably represent the world, anti-realists maintain. \nNow, in logic theories are treated as sets of sentences and the\nobjects (if any) that sentences talk about appear as elements of the\ndomain of set-theoretic entities called structures. Associated\nwith these structures are interpretation functions that map\nindividual constants onto individual objects of the domain and n-place\npredicates onto n-tuples of elements in the domain. When a structure\nmakes all the sentences of a given theory true it is called a\nmodel of the theory. By demonstrating that there is a model of\nT we show theory T is consistent. If T turns out to be true in its\nintended model, then T is true simpliciter.  \nFor an informal illustration of the basic ideas of model theory, see\nthe supplementary document,\n Model Theory: Core Ideas.\n  \nLet us call structures whose domains consist of numbers\n‘numeric’ structures. The nub of Putnam’s\nModel-Theoretic Argument against realism is that the realist cannot\ndistinguish the intended model for his/her total theory of the world\nfrom non-standard interlopers such as permuted models or ones derived\nfrom numeric models, even when total theory is a rationally optimal\none that consists, as it must do, of an infinite set of\nsentences and the realist is permitted to impose the most exacting\nconstraints to distinguish between models. This is a very surprising\nresult if true! How does Putnam arrive at it?  \nPutnam actually uses a number of different arguments to establish the\nconclusion above. Of prime concern to realists, as Taylor (2006)\nemphasises, is the argument based on Gödel’s Completeness\nTheorem, GCT. For, following Lewis [Lewis, 1984], realists might\nconcede to Putnam that they cannot single out the intended model or\ndistinguish it from various ersatz models, but argue that this is not\nnecessary since it suffices that an intended model exists,\neven if we cannot specify it. This response does not answer the GCT\nargument, however. For this argument purports to prove directly that\nan ideal theory of the world could not be false, a conclusion flatly\ninconsistent with realism. See the supplementary document\n The Model-Theoretic Argument and the Completeness Theorem\n for an outline of this argument.  \nPutnam has another argument, the Permutation Argument: \nSuppose that the realist is able to somehow specify the intended\nmodel. Call this intended model \\(W''\\). Then nothing the realist can\ndo can possibly distinguish \\(W''\\) from a permuted variant \\(W^*\\)\nwhich can be specified following Putnam 1994b, 356–357: \nInstead of considering two sentences “A cat is on a mat”\nand “A cat* is on a mat*” now consider only the one\n“A cat is on a mat”, allowing its interpretation to change\nby first adopting the standard interpretation for it and then adopting\nthe non-standard interpretation in which the set of cats* are assigned\nto ‘cat’ in every possible world and the set of mats* are\nassigned to ‘mat’ in every possible world. The result will\nbe the truth-value of “A cat is on a mat” will not change\nand will be exactly the same as before in every possible world.\nSimilar non-standard reference assignments could be constructed for\nall the predicates of a language. [See Putnam 1985, 1994b.] However,\nunlike the GCT argument, the Permutation Argument is susceptible to\nthe Lewis-styled reply above. \nAccording to conceptual pluralists, there can no more be an answer to\nthe question “What is the structure of the world?” outside\nof some scheme for classifying entities than there can be an answer to\nthe question of whether two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are simultaneous\noutside of some inertial frame for dating those events. The objects\nthat exist are the objects some conceptual scheme says\nexists—‘mesons exist’ really means ‘mesons\nexist relative to the conceptual scheme of current physics’. \nRealists think there is a unitary sense of ‘object’,\n‘property’ etc., for which the question “what\nobjects and properties does the world contain?” makes sense. Any\nanswer which succeeded in listing all the objects, properties, events\netc. which the world contains would comprise a privileged description\nof that totality [Putnam 1981]. Anti-realists reject this. For them\n‘object’, ‘property’ etc., shift their senses\nas we move from one conceptual scheme to another. Some anti-realists\nargue that there cannot be a totality of all the objects the world\ncontains since the notion of ‘object’ is indefinitely\nextensible and so, trivially, there cannot be a privileged description\nof any such totality. [For discussions of indefinite extensibility see\nDummett 1978, 1991; Linnebo 2018; Warren 2017]. \nHow does the anti-realist defend conceptual relativity? One way is by\narguing that there can be two complete theories of the world which are\ndescriptively equivalent yet logically incompatible from the\nrealist’s point of view. For example, theories of space-time can\nbe formulated in one of two mathematically equivalent ways: as an\nontology of points, with spatiotemporal regions being defined as sets\nof points; or as an ontology of regions, with points being defined as\nconvergent sets of regions. Such theories are descriptively equivalent\nsince mathematically equivalent and yet are logically incompatible\nfrom the realist’s point of view, anti-realists contend [Putnam\n1985, 1990]. \nWe now turn to some realist responses to these challenges. The\nManifestation and Language Acquisition arguments allege there is\nnothing in an agent’s cognitive or linguistic behaviour that\ncould provide evidence that s/he had grasped what it is for a sentence\nto be true in the realist’s sense of ‘true’. How can\nyou manifest a grasp of a notion which can apply or fail to apply\nwithout you being able to tell which? How could you ever learn to use\nsuch a concept? \nOne possible realist response is that the concept of truth is actually\nvery simple, and it is spurious to demand that one always be able to\ndetermine whether a concept applies. As to the first part, it is often\nargued that all there is to the notion of truth is what is given by\nthe formula “‘\\(p\\)’ is true if and only if\n\\(p\\)”. The function of the truth-predicate is to disquote\nsentences in the sense of undoing the effects of quotation—thus\nall that one is saying in calling the sentence “Yeti are\nvicious” true is that Yeti are vicious. \nIt is not clear that this response really addresses the\nanti-realist’s worry, however. It may well be that there is a\nsimple algorithm for learning the meaning of ‘true’ and\nthat, consequently, there is no special difficulty in learning to\napply the concept. But that by itself does not tell us whether the\npredicate ‘true’ applies to cases where we cannot\nascertain that it does. All the algorithm tells us, in effect, is that\nif it is legitimate to assert \\(p\\) it is legitimate to assert that\n‘\\(p\\)’ is true. So are we entitled to assert\n‘either Socrates did or did not sneeze in his sleep the night\nbefore he took the hemlock’ or are we not? Presumably that will\ndepend on what we mean by the sentence, whether we mean to be\nadverting to two states of affairs neither of which we have any\nprospect of ever confirming. \nAnti-realists follow verificationists in rejecting the intelligibility\nof such states of affairs and tend to base their rules for assertion\non intuitionistic logic, which rejects the universal applicability of\nthe Law of Bivalence (the principle that every statement is either\ntrue or false). This law is thought to be a foundational semantic\nprinciple for classical logic. However, some question whether\nclassical logic requires bivalence [e.g. Sandqvist 2009]. Others\ndispute the idea that acceptance or rejection of bivalence has any\nmetaphysical (rather than meaning-theoretic) consequences\n[Edgington, 1981; McDowell 1976; Pagin 1998; Gaiffman 1996]. There is,\nin addition, a question as to whether the anti-realist’s\npreferred substitute for realist truth-conditions in\nverification-conditions (or proof-conditions) satisfies the\nrequirement of exhaustive manifestability [Pagin 2009].  \nA more direct realist response to the Manifestation challenge points\nto the prevalence in our linguistic practices of realist-inspired\nbeliefs to which we give expression in what we say and do [McDowell\n1976]. We assert things like “either there were an odd or an\neven number of dinosaurs on this planet independently of what anyone\nbelieves” and all our actions and other assertions confirm that\nwe really do believe this. Furthermore, the overwhelming acceptance of\nclassical logic by mathematicians and scientists and their rejection\nof intuitionistic logic for the purposes of mainstream science\nprovides very good evidence for the coherence and usefulness of a\nrealist understanding of truth [Edgington 1981; Burgess 1984; Hellman\n1989, 1992].  \nAnti-realists reject this reply. They argue that all we make manifest\nby asserting things like “either there were an odd or an even\nnumber of dinosaurs on this planet independently of what anyone\nbelieves” is our pervasive misunderstanding of the notion of\ntruth. They apply the same diagnosis to the realist’s belief in\nthe mind-independence of entities in the world and to counterfactuals\nwhich express this belief. We overgeneralize the notion of truth,\nbelieving that it applies in cases where it does not, they contend\n[Tennant 1987, 1997; Wright 1993].  \nAn apparent consequence of their view is that reality is indeterminate\nin surprising ways—we have no grounds for asserting that\nSocrates did sneeze in his sleep the night before he took the hemlock\nand no grounds for asserting that he did not and no prospect of ever\nfinding out which. Does this mean that for anti-realists the world\ncontains no such fact as the fact that Socrates did one or the other\nof these two things? Not necessarily. For anti-realists who subscribe\nto intuitionistic principles of reasoning, the most that can be said\nis that there is no present warrant to assert \\(S \\lor \\neg S\\): that\nSocrates either did or did not sneeze in his sleep the night before he\ntook the hemlock. \nPerhaps anti-realists are right. But if so, they need to explain how a\npractice based on a pervasive illusion can be as successful as modern\nscience. Anti-realists perturbed by the manifestability of realist\ntruth are revisionists about parts of our linguistic practice, and the\nconsequence of this revisionist stance is that mathematics and science\nrequire extensive and non-trivial revision. The debate about whether\nclassical logic should (or can) be rejected on meaning-theoretic\ngrounds is ongoing: Burgess 1984, Hellman 1989, Michael 1999 and Read\n2000 are critical of Dummett’s case for rejecting classical\nlogic, whereas Cogburn 2005, Cozzo 1994, Prawitz 1977, 1987, 1994 and\nTennant 1997 are, in varying degrees, supportive.  \nThe challenge to realism posed by language acquisition is to explain\nhow a child (or novice) could come to know the meanings of certain\nsentences within his/her language: the ones the realist contends have\nundetectable truth-makers associated with them. How could the child\nlearn the meanings of such sentences if these meanings are determined\nby states of affairs not even competent speakers can detect? \nA straightforward realist reply is that knowledge of the meanings of\nsentences with undetectable truth-conditions is acquired in the same\nway as knowledge of the meanings of sentences with recognisable\ntruth-conditions: namely, compositionally by acquiring knowledge of\nthe lexicon and the relevant compositional principles [Pagin\n 2009].[2]\n Anti-realists respond by contesting the interpretation of the\ncompositional principles that generate sentences with undetectable\ntruth-conditions — where realists assert \\(S \\lor \\neg S\\) is\ntrue (\\(S\\) being the Socrates sentence), anti-realists maintain there\nis no ground for asserting this disjunction [e.g. Tennant 1987]. \nSome realists reject the publicity of meaning principle as it applies\nto language learning. While many accept that the meaning of a word is\ndetermined by its use in a given language, not all do [e.g. Chomsky\n1986; Fodor and Lepore 2002]. Realists who think of semantic\nunderstanding as a mental state reject the idea that a speaker’s\nunderstanding of meaning is exhaustively manifest in its use as an\ninstrument of communication rather than in its internal use in\nexpressing thought. If Dummett’s manifestation requirement is a\ndemand for a behaviouristic reduction of semantic knowledge, they\nargue, it should be rejected [Burgess 1984; Chomsky 1986]. However,\nsome sympathetic to the demand for full manifestability of semantic\nknowledge reject the behaviouristic construal and instead justify it\non conceptual grounds [e.g. Shieh 1998, McGee\n 2015].[3] \nThe Acquisition Challenge is a vexed one for realists because Dummett\nshares little common ground with the many (realist) philosophers,\nlinguists and cognitive scientists who believe language acquisition is\neffected by a dedicated language module [Fodor 1975, 1983, 2008;\nChomsky 1986, 2006; Crain 2012; Pinker 1994] or even with those who\ndisavow modularity but agree that semantic knowledge is partly\nunconscious. Thus, Dummett rejected Chomsky’s thesis that\nspeakers have unconscious knowledge of the rules of Universal Grammar\non the Wittgensteinian grounds that it was, at best “an\nexplanatory hypothesis, not a systematisation of facts open to\nview.” [Dummett 1981]. Dummett apparently took this\n“systemisation of facts” to be satisfied by an account\nthat pairs knowledge of meaning with recognitional\n abilities.[4] \nIt is worth noting that evidence from developmental psychology\nindicates some meaning is pre-linguistic and that some pre-linguistic\nmeaning or conceptual content relate to situations that are not\ndetectable by the child. For example, psychologists have discovered\nsystems of core knowledge activated in infancy that govern the\nrepresentation of, inter alia concrete objects and human\nagents [see Spelke 2003; Spelke and Kinzler 2007]. An interesting\nfinding from preferential gaze experiments suggests 4 month old\ninfants represent occluded objects as continuing behind their\n barriers.[5] \nWhile these findings do not by themselves show that the meanings of\nmental symbols is not determined by public use, they do provide\nevidence that ‘verification-transcendent’ conceptual\ncontent is laid down in the earliest stages of cognitive development.\n \nThe Brains-in-a-Vat argument purports to show that, given semantic\nexternalism, realism is incoherent on the grounds that it is both\ncommitted to the genuine possibility of our being brains in a vat and\nyet entails something that anti-realists judge to be inconsistent with\nthis: namely, that were we to be so envatted we could not possibly\nhave the thought that we were. \nRealists have three obvious responses. \nAs for (i), one might question the coherence of the idea of our being\nbrains in a vat on the grounds that the skeptical hypothesis uses\nterms which derive their meaning from successful theory to pose a\nproblem which, if intelligible, would rob those very terms of meaning.\n \nWhat of option (ii)—denying semantic externalism? Is this really\na live prospect for realists? Semantic externalism no longer commands\nthe consensus amongst realists that it did when Putnam formulated his\nBrains-in-a-Vat argument. David Lewis, a prominent realist, rejected\nexternalism in favour of a sophisticated semantic internalism based on\na ‘Two-Dimensional’ analysis of modality proposed by\nStalnaker [Lewis 1994]. Frank Jackson [Jackson 2000] contributed to\nthe development of internalist 2D semantics and used it to formulate a\nversion of materialism grounded on conceptual analysis that provides a\nuseful model of a physicalistic realist’s metaphysics. \nOther realists reject externalism because they think that the\nRepresentation Problem is just a pseudo-problem. When we say things\nlike “‘cat’ refers to cats” or\n“‘quark’ refers to quarks” we are simply\nregistering our dispositions to call everything we consider\nsufficiently cat-like/quark-like,\n‘cat’/’quark’ [Horwich, 1990; Resnick,\n1990]. \nAccording to these semantic deflationists, it is just a confusion to\nask how the link was set up between our use of the term ‘the Big\nBang’ and the event of that name which occurred some fourteen\nbillion years ago. Yet, if all there is to the story are our\nlinguistic dispositions and the conditions to which they are presently\nattuned, the case has effectively been ceded to the anti-realist who\ndenies it is possible to set up a correlation between our utterances\nor thoughts and mind-independent states of affairs.  \nPerhaps the most effective realist rejoinder is (iii). We shall return\nto this response after we have reviewed Putnam’s Brains-in-a-Vat\nArgument, BIVA. \nHow does Putnam prove we can know we are not brains in a vat? To\nunderstand Putnam’s argument, we need to first recall the\n‘Twin-Earth’ considerations used to support Semantic\nExternalism: on Twin-Earth things are exactly as they are here on\nEarth except for one difference—whereas for Earthly humans water\nhas the chemical composition H2O, for our\ndöppelgangers on Twin-Earth, twumans, water is instead composed\nof some substance unknown to us on Earth, XYZ. Now when you and your\ntwuman counterpart say (or think) “‘Water’ refers to\nwater” both of you utter (or think) truths. But which truth you\nboth think or utter differs. For humans “‘Water’\nrefers to water” expresses the truth that the term\n‘water’ in English refers to that substance whose chemical\ncomposition is H2O. For our twuman Twin-Earth counterparts,\nhowever, their sentence “‘Water’ refers to\nwater” expresses the truth that their term ‘water’\nin Twenglish refers to that substance whose chemical composition is\nXYZ. \nWith these points about Externalism in mind, consider Putnam’s\nBIVA [we follow the formulation section 7 of the entry\n skepticism and content externalism].\n Let us call whatever it is that an envatted brain’s symbol\n‘tree’ refers to, if it refers at all,\n\\(v\\)-trees. Then the BIVA is:  \nNow (1) seems correct: if I am a brain-in-a-vat then, given\nexternalism, my symbol ‘tree’ cannot refer to trees since\nthere aren’t any trees in the vat-world—a BIV’s\n‘tree’ symbol refers to \\(v\\)-trees, not\ntrees. But what reason do we have to believe (2)? If we are BIVs\nwon’t our ‘tree’ symbols refer to v-trees rather\nthan trees? Crispin Wright [1992b] argues that all language-users,\nwhether humans or brains-in-a-vat, can be certain of (2) since they\ncan know they use language meaningfully and thus can know that their\nlanguage disquotes. Graeme Forbes [1995] questions Wright’s\nargument.  \nDiscussion of the brains-in-a-vat hypothesis has been extensive. Early\ncontributions by Brueckner 1986, 1992; David 1991; Ebbs 1992; Forbes\n1995 reconstruct Putnam’s argument and assess it from a realist\nperspective. Important defences of the BIVA are provided by Wright\n1992b; Tymoczko 1989; Button 2013, 2015. Some recent discussions bring\nBayesian [Huemer 2016] or psychological [Jackson 2015] considerations\nto bear on Putnam’s BIV hypothesis. A valuable collection of\nessays is Goldberg 2015. \nEven if it were to turn out that the BIVA is not sound, Putnam’s\nchallenge to the realist remains unanswered. This was to show how\nrealism could be coherent if it is committed both to: \nand to the consequence that: \nWhile it is usually not remarked upon, there is no logical\nincoherence in accepting both (I) and (II)—as the figure below\nillustrates. There is thus no logical incoherence in believing both\nthat it is possible that one is a BIV and that if one is a BIV one\ncould never come to know this.  \nFigure. Consider a universe of 4 worlds.\nIf we are not in fact brains-in-a-vat (so that the hypothesis\n\\(v\\) that we are brains in a vat is false, \\(\\neg v\\) is true at\n\\(w^*\\), the actual world) we can nonetheless entertain \\((E)\\), the\nhypothesis that we are (so that \\(Ev\\) is true at \\(w^*\\)),\nrecognizing as we do so that were we to inhabit a world such as \\(w'\\)\nin which we are brains-in-a-vat (\\(v\\) holds at \\(w'\\)), we would lack\nthe semantic resources to articulate thoughts reflecting our own\nenvatted state so that we could not so much as entertain the\nthought that we were brains-in-a-vat (\\(\\neg Ev\\) holds not only at\n\\(w'\\) but at all those worlds ( \\(w''\\), \\(w'''\\)) accessible from\n\\(w'\\)). \nNick Bostrom has recently argued it is quite likely that we humans are\nactually virtual humans: computer simulations of flesh and\nblood creatures. Bostrom reasons that if our mental lives can be\nsimulated then it is highly probable that our distant descendants\n(more intelligent or at least more technologically advanced\n‘post-human’ successors) will eventually create such a\nsimulation in which case it is more likely that we are the unwitting\ndenizens of a simulated world than the flesh and blood inhabitants of\nthe real world we take ourselves to be. At least this will be so\nunless the chances that creatures of our intelligence are doomed to\nbecome extinct before reaching the technological sophistication to\ncreate simulations are overwhelmingly large or else almost no such\ntechnologically capable civilizations have any interest in simulating\nminds like ours in the first place [Bostrom, N., 2003].  \nBostrom’s position owes nothing to skepticism, he is concerned\nsolely with the question of whether virtual humans are empirically\npossible and, if so, how likely it is that we might be such beings.\nHis argument, if sound, makes it look very doubtful that we can know\na priori that we are not brains-in-a-vat,\nwhen BIVs are understood to be virtual humans in a\n simulation.[6]\n If Bostrom is correct, Putnam’s attempt to prove we cannot\nbe BIVs must be flawed. However, the Simulation Argument is\nnothing if not controversial: it has provoked interest from\ncosmologists as well as philosophers [For discussion of the Simulation\nHypothesis see Bostrom, 2005; Brueckner 2008; Chalmers 2010;\nWeatherson 2003].  \nIf metaphysical realism is to be tenable, it must be possible for even\nthe best theories to be mistaken. Or so metaphysical realists have\nthought. Whence, such realists reject the Model-Theoretic Argument MTA\nwhich purports to show that this is not possible. Here is an informal\nsketch of the MTA due to van Fraassen [1997]: \nHere ‘TRUE(SAT)’ means “true relative to a mapping\nof the terms of the language of \\(T\\) onto (sets of) items in the\nworld”. \nBut why should we interpret ‘true’ as TRUE(SAT)? Because\ntruth is truth in an intended model and, Putnam argues, amongst all\nthe models of \\(T\\) that make all its theses come out true there is\nguaranteed to be at least one that passes all conceivable constraints\nwe can reasonably impose on a model in order for it to be an intended\nmodel of \\(T\\).  \nRealists have responded to the argument by rejecting the claim that a\nmodel \\(M\\) of the hypothetical ideal theory \\(T\\) passes every\ntheoretical constraint simply because all of the theory’s theses\ncome out true in it. For there is no guarantee, they claim, that terms\nstand in the right relation of reference to the objects to which \\(M\\)\nlinks them. To be sure, if we impose another theoretical constraint,\nsay: \nthen \\(M\\) (or some model based on it) can interpret this RRC\nconstraint in such a way as to make it come out true. \nBut there is a difference between a model’s making some\ndescription of a constraint come out true and its actually conforming\nto that constraint, metaphysical realists insist [Devitt 1983, 1991;\nLewis 1983, 1984]. \nFor their part, anti-realists have taken the metaphysical\nrealist’s insistence on a Right Reference Constraint to be\n‘just more theory’—what it is for a model to conform\nto a constraint is for us to be justified in asserting that it does.\nUnfortunately, this has led to something of a stand-off. Metaphysical\nrealists think that anti-realists are refusing to acknowledge a clear\nand important distinction. Anti-realists think realists are simply\nfalling back on dogmatism at a crucial point in the argument. \nOn the face of it, the Permutation Argument presents a genuine\nchallenge to any realist who believes in determinate reference. But it\ndoes not refute metaphysical realism unless such realism is committed\nto determinate reference in the first place and it is not at all\nobvious that this is so. \nRealist responses to this argument vary widely. At one extreme are the\n‘determinatists’, those who believe that Nature has set up\nsignificant, determinate referential connections between our mental\nsymbols and items in the world. They contend that all the argument\nshows is that the distribution of truth-values across possible worlds\nis not sufficient to determine reference [van Cleve 1992]. \nAt another extreme are ‘indeterminatists’, realists who\nconcede the conclusion, agreeing that it demonstrates that word-world\nreference is massively indeterminate or ‘inscrutable’. The\nlocus classicus for inscrutability of reference is Quine 1964 [See\nalso Quine 1969, 1992; Davidson 1979].  \nSome infer from this that reference could not possibly consist in\ncorrespondences between mental symbols and objects in the world. For\nthem all that makes ‘elephant’ refer to elephants is that\nour language contains the word ‘elephant’. This is\nDeflationism about reference. Vann McGee presents a strong case for\ninscrutability on a deflationary view of reference, one that is\ngrounded in a “… peculiarly egocentric conception of\nsemantics—questions of others’ meanings are settled by\nasking what I mean by the words of my language” [McGee\n2015]. \nIn between these two extremes are those prepared to concede the\nargument establishes the real possibility of a significant and\nsurprising indeterminacy in the reference of our mental symbols but\nwho take it to be an open question whether other constraints can be\nfound which pare down the range of reference assignments to just the\nintuitively acceptable\n ones.[7] \nThe simplest and most direct response to the MTA questions its\nvalidity. Thus Devitt and Lewis claim that Putnam’s alternative\nmodel \\(M\\) has not been shown to satisfy every theoretical\nconstraint merely by making some description of each\ntheoretical constraint true. \nSkolem’s Paradox in set theory seems to present a striking\nillustration of Lewis’s distinction. The Löwenheim-Skolem\nTheorem states that every consistent, countable set of first-order\nformulae has a denumerable model, in fact a model in the set of\nintegers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). Now in ZF one can prove the existence of sets\nwith a non-denumerable number of elements such as the set\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) of real numbers. Yet the ZF axioms comprise a\nconsistent, countable set of first-order formulae and thus by the\nLöwenheim-Skolem Theorem has a model in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). So\nZF’s theorem \\(\\phi\\) stating that \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is\nnon-denumerable will come out true in a denumerable model \\(\\mu\\) of\nZF. \nHow can this be? One explanation is that \\(\\mu\\) makes \\(\\phi\\) true\nonly at the cost of re-interpreting the term\n‘non-denumerable’ so that it no longer means\nnon-denumerable. Thus \\(\\mu\\) is not the intended model\n\\(M^*\\) of ZF. It looks as if the metaphysical realist has a clear\nillustration of Lewis’s distinction at hand in set theory. \nUnfortunately for the realist, this is not the only explanation. In\nfact, Putnam used this very example in an early formulation of the\nMTA. Just because there are different models that satisfy \\(\\phi\\) in\nsome of which \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is non-denumerable but in others of which\n(such as \\(\\mu\\)) \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is denumerable, Putnam argued, it is\nimpossible to pin down the intended interpretation of\n‘set’ via first-order axioms. Moreover, well before\nPutnam, Skolem and his followers had taken the moral of Skolem’s\nParadox to be that set-theoretic notions are indeterminate [For\nfurther discussion, see the entry on\n Skolem’s paradox]. \nThe question of how to interpret Skolem’s Paradox merely raises\nanew the question of what it is for a theory such as the hypothesized\nideal theory \\(T\\) to satisfy a right reference constraint, (RRC). \nPutnam [1985] regards it as simply question-begging for a realist to\nassume her notion of an intended model is determinate: i.e. that terms\nsuch as ‘satisfaction’ or ‘correspondence’\nrefer to those relations to which she wishes them to refer. That her\nterm ‘refers’ refers to her desired reference relation is\n‘just more theory’. Realists have responded that Putnam is\nwilfully re-interpreting their semantic terms as he sees\n fit.[8] \nIs there some independent way to validate Lewis’s distinction?\nMichael Resnick thinks so [Resnick 1987]. Putnam maintained that\n\\(M\\), the model he constructs of the ideal theory \\(T\\), is an\nintended model because it passes every operational and theoretical\nconstraint we could reasonably impose. It passes every theoretical\nconstraint, he argues, simply because it makes every thesis of \\(T\\)\ntrue. But unless the Reflection Principle (RP) below\nholds, Resnick argues, this inference is just a\nnon-sequitur: \nHowever, this principle is false. The simplest counterexample to it,\nResnick points out, is Tarskian truth. Suppose we impose on\n\\(T\\)’s model \\(M\\) a condition \\(f^*\\) that \\(M\\) makes all of\n\\(T\\)’s theses come out true. Then, unless \\(T\\) is either\ninconsistent or too weak to express elementary arithmetic no truth\npredicate will be definable in \\(T\\). Whence there will be no\ncondition \\(C\\) expressible in \\(T\\) corresponding to this condition\n\\(f^*\\) on \\(T\\)’s model(s) \\(M\\). \nResnick concludes (ibid): \nThe philosophical consensus appears to be that Lewis and Resnick are\nright. Apart from the authors already discussed, important criticisms\nof the MTA were advanced in Hale and Wright 1997, van Cleve 1992 and\nBays 2008. However, some very sophisticated anti-realist attempts to\nbuttress the Model-Theoretic Argument against Lewis-styled criticisms\nhave appeared. Igor Douven reconstructs Putnam’s argument,\ndefending it against standard objections [Douven 1999]. Barry Taylor\npresents a detailed explication and defence of Putnam’s Just\nMore Theory reply [Taylor 2006], as does Tim Button [Button 2013].\nWhether these newer formulations of the MTA succeed in answering the\nLewis/Resnick objection is an open\n question.[9] \nTo the extent it makes the existence of all things relative to the\nclassificatory skills of minds, conceptual relativism appears highly\ncounter-intuitive to realists. Whilst it may seem plausible to some\nthat moral values or perhaps even colours might disappear with the\nextinction of sentient life on Earth, it is not at all plausible to\nthink that trees, rocks and microbes would follow in their train.  \nThis is not how Putnam understands his idea of conceptual relativity,\nhowever, which thesis he distinguishes from conceptual relativism. As\nhe sees things, we accept a theory which licenses us to assert\n“Electrons exist” and also licenses us to assert “if\nhumans were to disappear from this planet, electrons need not follow\nin their train” since the theory assures us that the existence\nof electrons in no way causally depends on the existence of humans.\nFor the anti-realist our well-founded practices of assertion ground at\none and the same time our conception of the world and our conception\nof humanity’s place within it. \nRealists might still worry that whether there are to be any electrons\nin the anti-realist’s ontology apparently depends upon the\nconceptual schemes humans happen to chance upon and Putnam himself\nencourages this interpretation: “‘objects’ do not\nexist independently of conceptual schemes” [Putnam 1981]. The\nrelativity of existence to conceptual scheme is, in this respect,\nquite unlike the relativity of simultaneity to frame of reference. \nStill, anti-realists maintain that there are actual instances of\nconceptual schemes that explain the same phenomena equally well,\nschemes which, they aver, realists must judge to be logically\nincompatible. The earlier example of competing theories of space-time\nwas a case in point. On one theory, \\(T_1\\), space-time consists of\nunextended spatiotemporal points and regions of space-time are sets of\nthese points. According to the second theory, \\(T_2\\), space-time\nconsists of extended spatiotemporal regions and points are logical\nconstructions—convergent sets of regions. Realists will judge\nthat only one of the two theories can be true if they really are\nlogically incompatible. Anti-realists respond that the two theories\n\\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) cannot differ in truth-value since they are\ndescriptively equivalent.  \nAnti-realists regard two theories as descriptively equivalent if each\ntheory can be interpreted in the other and both theories explain the\nsame phenomena. Is there nothing more to the notion of descriptive\nequivalence than this? Realists might not accept that there\nisn’t. \nConsider our two competing theories of space-time \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\)\nagain. Are \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) descriptively equivalent? At the stroke\nof midnight Cinderella’s carriage changes into a\npumpkin—it is a carriage up to midnight, a pumpkin thereafter.\nAccording to the region-based theory \\(T_2\\) which takes temporal\nintervals as its primitives, that’s all there is to it. But if\nthere are temporal points, instants, as \\(T_1\\) affirms, there is a\nfurther issue left undecided by this story—viz, at the moment of\nmidnight is the carriage still a carriage or is it a pumpkin? \nSo does the region-based theory fail to recognize certain facts or are\nthese putative facts merely artefacts of the punctate theory’s\ndescriptive resources, reflecting nothing in reality? We cannot\ndeclare the two theories \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) descriptively equivalent\nuntil we resolve this question at least. \nIn fact, there is no reason why realists cannot agree with\nanti-realists in regarding the conflict between a punctate geometry\nand a region-based geometry as merely apparent. Thomas\nWilliam Barrett and Hans Halvorson argue that the two theories “\n… are simply convenient ways of expressing the geometric facts that\nare more fully expressed by a comprehensive theory” that\nquantifies over both points and lines. \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) cannot be\nincompatible according to Barrett and Halvorson because they are in\nessence the same theory [Barrett and Halvorson 2017].\nHowever, the geometric case is a rather special one. \nConsider another Putnam-styled case [Putnam 2004]. Ernie looks into\nhis bag and sees there are 3 coins and nothing else and announces\n“There are exactly 3 objects in my bag.” Maxi looks into\nErnie’s bag and shakes her head “No Ernie there are 7\nobjects in your bag!” she corrects him. The Carnapian pluralist\nfeels she can defuse the conflict and accommodate both points of view\nby maintaining that whilst 3 objects exist-in-\\(E\\) (where \\(E\\) is\nErnie’s everyday framework), 7 objects exist-in-\\(M\\) (with\n\\(M\\) Maxi’s mereological framework). But even if Maxi can\nendorse both of these claims (since the mereological objects include\nErnie’s 3 coins), it is not at all certain Ernie can do so. If\nErnie is unpersuaded that mereological fusions of objects are\nthemselves objects, then Maxi’s putative truthmaker for her\nframework-relative existence claim “7 objects\nexist-in-\\(M\\)” will be unconvincing to him. \nFor this case, the pluralist’s suggestion that 3 objects\nexist-in-\\(E\\) but 7 objects exist-in-\\(M\\) is not clearly warranted.\nThere are simpler explanations: one is that by ‘object’\nErnie means ordinary object, by ‘object’ Maxi means\nmereological object. Nothing deeper than that is required to explain\ntheir disagreement. Rather than existence or truth that is\nrelativized, the meanings of their terms differ. On this account,\npluralists have mistaken a plurality of meanings for a plurality of\nmodes of being. However, other explanations are also possible: for\ninstance, it may be that Ernie and Maxi do mean the same thing by\n‘object’ but hold incompatible theories about what counts\nas an object. More importantly, as a reviewer noted, the debate\nneed not turn on the notion of an object: it can proceed with\nquantifiers, for example. The disagreement then would arise from\ndivergent interpretations of those quantifiers. \nPutnam’s pluralism has provoked very different reactions from\nrealists. Some argue that conceptual pluralism is consistent with\nrealism [Lynch 1998; Horgan and Timmons 2002; Sosa 2003], others take\nPutnam’s pluralism to amount to the claim that ontological\nexpressions are either indeterminate or that alternative ontologies\nare equally good, both alternatives being problematic [Eklund 2008].\nRealists cannot make sense of the Carnapian idea that existence and\ntruth are relative to a conceptual scheme [Brueckner 1998]. Peter van\nInwagen provides a trenchant criticism of Putnam’s claims [van\nInwagen 2002]:  \nRecently, however, some impressive neo-Carnapian defences of\nconceptual pluralism have been proposed that bring new considerations\nto bear on these debates. We briefly review some of these in section\n5. \nDebates in meta-ontology (analytic ontology) over the last twenty\nyears have sparked renewed interest in realism. They have also seen a\nmarked shift in how realism, i.e. ontological realism, is understood.\n“The central question of metaontology”, Theodore Sider, a\nprominent ontological realist, contends, “is that of whether\nthere are many equally good quantifier meanings, or whether there is a\nsingle best quantifier meaning.” [Sider 2009, p.397]. Where\nSider argues for a single best quantifier meaning, Eli Hirsch believes\nthere are a multiplicity of possible quantifier meanings that are\nequally good, a thesis he calls Quantifier Variance. This\nmeaning-theoretic focus is something\n new.[10] \nIt is no surprise, then, to find that the positions marked out as\n‘realist’ and ‘anti-realist’ by those engaged\nin ontological disputes do not always coincide with realism and\nanti-realism as we have explained these metaphysical\n views.[11] \nA more significant division is between metaontologists who accept a\nrobust conception of ontology, and deflationists about\nontology who don’t. Sider defends robust ontology [Sider 2009,\n385–386]: \nNeo-Carnapians such as Putnam, Eli Hirsch, David Chalmers, Amie\nThomasson, and Huw Price are ontological deflationists who embrace\nconceptual pluralism about ontological matters. Hirsch, however,\nthinks conceptual pluralism is perfectly consistent with realism\n[Hirsch, E. 2002]. Matti Eklund understands Hirsch to mean that he\nconsiders the world to be an amorphous lump [Eklund, M., 2008] (citing\nMichael Dummett), a ‘lump’ that alternative and equally\nfeasible conceptual schemes serve to make intelligible. For Sider, in\ncontrast, rejecting an intrinsic structure to the world is to reject\n realism.[12] \nCompeting views about temporal persistence do not seem to be semantic\nin nature. While Perdurantists believe that things persist through\ntime by virtue of having temporal parts that perdure,\nEndurantists reject the notion of temporal parts as incoherent\n—things persist by enduring: they are wholly present\nwhenever they exist. As observed in the entry on\n temporal parts: \nEli Hirsch is not convinced, however: \nHow can this be? Endurantists think perdurantists are guilty of\nspatializing time when they talk about temporal parts; perdurantists\nthink enduring objects cannot explain change. How can there be a\nrapprochement of the sort Hirsch has in mind? \nHirsch’s novel and intriguing idea is that what makes the\nendurantist/perdurantist temporal parts debate and the\nnihilist/universalist mereological debate merely verbal ones is the\nfact that the protagonists in these debates mean different things by\ntheir quantifiers, in particular their existential quantifiers, in\ntheir ontological assertions. While both protagonists speak a common\nlanguage, here English, in which certain ontological claims such as\n‘there are tables’ happen to come out true, this is a\nsuperficial socio-linguistic fact about English that might not have\nbeen so: we and they could just as easily have spoken English* (an\nontological nihilist language) in which the sentence ‘there are\ntables’ came out false. Protagonists in these ontological\ndisputes are, unwittingly, engaged in a ‘merely verbal’\ndebate and are thus talking past each\n other.[13] \nHow does the deflationist tell that an ontological dispute is a\n‘merely verbal’ one? Hirsch thinks that when we interpret\nthe words of another, we assign truth-conditions to their sentences by\nmatching those sentences with sets of possible worlds, guided by the\nmetasemantic maxim that the speaker’s assertion of those\nsentences should come out true. The maxim applies to ontological\ndisputes such as the Ernie/Maxi dispute about mereology — there\nare possible languages in which both speakers’ assertions come\nout true. Hirsch contends: “speakers of either language should\nallow that speakers of the other language assert sentences that have\nthe same characters (DK: functions from contexts of utterance to\ntruth-conditions) and the same truth-values as they themselves\nassert.” [Hirsch 2009, p.242].  \nIn this way Ernie should attribute the same set of possible worlds\n(intensions) to Maxi’s sentence ‘There are seven objects\nin your bag’ as he associates with his own sentence ‘There\nare three objects in my bag’ and Ernie should interpret Maxi as\nuttering a truth in so doing. Ernie and Maxi are asserting the very\nsame proposition but are using different words to express it. They\nare, as a result, simply talking past each other.  \nHirsch’s doctrine of quantifier variance QV dominates current\nmetaontological debate. Some have questioned whether interpreters on\none side of an ontological dispute can admit that the language of\nthose on the other side is possible. For to do so each interpreter\nmust be able to provide a Tarskian semantics for the other’s\nlanguage. But an Endurantist won’t be able to do this for the\nPerdurantist’s sentence such as ‘Alicet is a\ntemporal part of Alice’ since the predicate ‘is a temporal\npart of’ has an empty extension in the Endurantist’s\nlanguage [Hawthorne 2006; Eklund 2009]. Others suspect QV is an\ninternally unstable position: how can an Endurantist speaking her\nlanguage E allow that a sentence like ‘Alicet is a\ntemporal part of Alice’ is a true sentence of the\nPerdurantist’s language P without admitting that there are\ntemporal parts [e.g. Hale and Wright 2009; Dorr 2014]? Warren 2015\nprovides a convincing QV response to this ‘Collapse’\nargument. An important resource, containing papers by some of the\nauthors cited, is the collection of essays anthologised in Chalmers et\nal 2009 [For background on mereology see the entry\n mereology\n and for discussion of whether there are composite objects, see the\nentry\n material constitution\n and the entry\n ordinary objects].\n  \nThe meaning-theoretic focus on Quantifier Variance in metaontology\nrepresents a fascinating development. The implications for ontological\nrealism are as yet undecided. \nWe have considered a number of challenges to realism, the thesis that\nthe objects and properties that the world contains, its nature and\nstructure, exist independently of our conception or perception of\nthem. Historically, these challenges came from two camps: (1)\nneo-verificationists led by Dummett who assimilate belief in\nmind-independent world to a belief in a verification-transcendent\nconception of truth which they profess to find unintelligible, and (2)\npragmatists and pluralists led by Putnam who also question the\nintelligibility of the realist’s mind-independent world but for\nreasons independent of any commitment to verificationism. While\nneo-verificationism today claims few adherents, within the ranks of\nanalytic ontologists, pluralism and Carnap’s version of it in\nparticular, has enjoyed something of a revival. Today, the most active\nand engaging debates about realism are meta-ontological ones that\ninvolve neo-Carnapian pluralists and their ontological realist\nopponents.  \nBoth the historical debate between realists and their anti-realist\nopponents and the meta-ontological debate are still very much open. If\nrealists could provide a plausible theory about how correspondences\nbetween mental symbols and the items in the world to which they refer\nmight be set up, many of these challenges could be met. Alternatively,\nif they could explain how, consistently with our knowledge of a\nmind-independent world, no such correspondences are required to begin\nwith, many of the anti-realist objections would fall away as\nirrelevant. In the absence of such explanations it is still entirely\nreasonable for realists to believe that the correspondences are in\nplace, however, and there can, indeed, be very good evidence for\nbelieving this. Ignorance of Nature’s reference-fixing mechanism\nis no reason for denying it exists.","contact.mail":"drew.khlentzos@mq.edu.au","contact.domain":"mq.edu.au"}]
