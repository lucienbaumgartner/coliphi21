David Walker","entry":"israeli","body.text":"\n\n\n\nIsaac ben Solomon Israeli (ca. 855–955 CE), not to be confused with\nIsaac Israeli the Younger (an astronomer of Spain, d. 1322 CE), served\nas physician to the founder of the Fatimid Dynasty in North Africa and\nwrote several philosophical and medical treatises in Arabic which were\nsubsequently translated and widely read in Latin and Hebrew. Israeli\nwas one of the earliest medieval Jewish Neoplatonist writers, though\nnot as original in his thinking as later Jewish philosophers such as\nSolomon Ibn Gabirol (Avicebron), Moses Maimonides and Gersonides. His\nwork reflected and encapsulated the prevailing philosophical paradigm,\nnamely, Aristotelian thought read through a Neoplatonist\nlens. Israeli’s thought was largely influenced by the Arab philosopher\nal-Kindi (d. ca. 870 CE) and by available Neoplatonist sources,\neither The Theology of Aristotle or (by S. M. Stern’s\nhypothesis) a pseudepigraphic Neoplatonist treatise (no longer extant\nin the Arabic original) which was later translated into Hebrew by\nAbraham Ibn Hasday (d. 1240) and appended to the belles-lettrist\nwork The Prince and the Ascetic. Although much of his work is\nparaphrase and commentary on these two sources, Israeli’s thought did\ninclude a few divergences from al-Kindi, such as the idea of the\nemanation of shadow, and a reversal of the process of intellection\ndescribed in al-Kindi’s model. Israeli’s philosophical works were read\nby several later Jewish and Christian authors who occasionally quoted\nhim, sometimes without attribution. His medical treatises were widely\nread and respected by physicians for centuries in Muslim and Christian\ndomains.\n\n\n\nWe have only a few scant clues of his biography, and we cannot be\nsure of their veracity, especially in the issue of the date of his\ndeath. We know that he lived the first half of his life in Egypt,\nbefore moving to Karouan, Tunisia between the years of 905–907.\nMost biographers agree that he lived to the age of 100, though they\ndisagree on the years of birth and death. Sacid\nal-Andalusi (mid-11th century), in his work Kitab\nTabakat al-Umam, indicates that he died in 932 (R. Blachere 1935,\np. 157). However, one of Israeli’s pupils, Ibn al-Jazzar\ndied in 1009 at an approximate age of 80. If Israeli had died in\n932, Ibn al-Jazzar would have been only five years old at his death,\nthus this date is unlikely. Abraham Ibn Hasday, a translator of\nIsraeli’s works from Arabic into Hebrew, provides the date of his\npassing as 942. But Altmann and Stern (Isaac Israeli, p.\nxx) have pointed out that Ibn Hasday likely made a transcription error\nin his quotation of Sacid al-Andalusi. Another student\nof Israeli, Dunash Ibn Tamim, wrote a commentary on the Jewish mystical\nwork Sefer Yetzirah in 956, and indicated therein that Israeli\nwas no longer alive, though not mentioning the year of his death. \n\nThe Arab chroniclers of physicians indicate that Isaac Israeli\nserved as a doctor to Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi, the founder of the Fatimid\nDynasty of North Africa, who reigned from 910–934. In his\ncapacity as physician, Israeli wrote several medical treatises which\nwere widely regarded in the Islamic world, and highly valued in\nChristian scholastic circles as well. These works include the\nBook of Fevers, the Book of Foodstuffs and Drugs, and\nthe Book of Urine. Later Islamic historians relate\naccounts that the first and third Fatimid rulers died from not\nfollowing the sound advice of Isaac Israeli, though the absence of\nthese anecdotes in the earlier chronicles, combined with their literary\ntrope-like character, render the tales suspect. Nonetheless,\nthese narratives do indicate the great respect accorded to Isaac\nIsraeli. \n\nAlthough the chronicler Ibn Abi Usaybi’a, as well as titles of\nsome of Israeli’s work in manuscripts, assign Israeli the\npatronymic term Abu Yacqub (“father of Jacob”),\nthe biographers state that he never married or fathered children, and\nattribute to him the statement that his books will cause his name to be\nremembered far better than children would. The\nassignment of patronymics to persons who did not marry and beget\noffspring is not altogether rare—thus we also see the patronymic\n“Abu Ayub” applied to the childless poet and philosopher\nSolomon Ibn Gabirol. As some of Israeli’s treatises have\nsurvived over a millennium and remain the occasional subject of\nscholarly research, his prediction is correct. \n\nRegrettably, in his surviving treatises, Israeli does not discuss\nhis philosophical studies. We do know that by Isaac\nIsraeli’s lifetime, several Greek books of philosophy translated\ninto Arabic as well as original Arabic philosophical works were\navailable, though perhaps some of these treatises, mostly produced in\nBaghdad and its environs, had not yet journeyed westward to North\nAfrica. Much of Aristotle’s corpus had been translated in\nthe previous century, as had Porphyry’s Isagoge, often\nstudied as an introduction to Aristotle’s works. Further,\nan Arabic partial paraphrase of Plotinus’ Enneads\ncirculated under the pseudepigraphic title The Theology of\nAristotle in two recensions, the shorter of which is called the\nVulgate Theology of Aristotle (due to its larger number of\nmanuscripts) while the other recension is called the Longer\nTheology of Aristotle. There are both significant\nparallels and significant variances between Israeli’s writings\nand the Longer Theology of Aristotle. Thus, the\ninfluences of Aristotle and Plotinus on Israeli’s philosophy are\nstrong, and he likely read translations of their works as well as\ncommentaries on them. \n\nS.M. Stern argues for the existence of a lost pseudepigraphic Arabic\ntreatise which influenced the longer recension of The Theology of\nAristotle and Isaac Israeli, and was quoted without proper\nattribution by both. Further, he argues that this same treatise\nis identical to a philosophical excursus which was appended to the\nliterary tale The Tale of the Prince and the Ascetic (Hebrew:\nSefer ben ha-melech veha-nazir) when Abraham Ibn Hasday\ntranslated the text from Arabic (Bilawhar wa-Yudasaf) into\nHebrew in the thirteenth century. Although one may be\ntempted to conjecture that the Neoplatonist appendix is an original\nwork by Ibn Hasday which largely paraphrases Israeli—a hypothesis\nstrengthened by the fact that Ibn Hasday had translated Israeli’s\nBook of the Elements—Stern disproves this\npossibility by demonstrating that Israeli’s Book of\nSubstances is largely a commentary on the metaphysics of Ibn\nHasday’s treatise, and Israeli’s Book on Spirit and the\nSoul is an attempt to reconcile Ibn Hasday’s treatise with\nscriptural proof texts. Hence, according to Altmann and Stern,\nIsraeli was strongly influenced by this treatise they call “Ibn\nHasday’s Neoplatonist.” Further, we know that Israeli\ndid not author this treatise, for when he quoted it, he cited\n“the philosopher,” thereby indicating that he thought he\nwas quoting Aristotle. \n\nMore recently, Fritz Zimmerman has argued that Stern’s hypothesis of\nan otherwise unattested “Neoplatonist” as source for Israeli is\nsuperfluous.  Israeli’s source may have been the Longer Theology of\nAristotle, while Ibn Hasday’s source may simply have been Israeli,\neither synthesizing the view’s in Israeli’s extant treatises, or\nparaphrasing a lost treatise of Israeli’s.  In the absence of further\ndocumentary evidence, neither Stern’s nor Zimmerman’s theory can be\ndefinitively ruled out. \n\nIsaac Israeli’s passages on intellection, interpreted by Stern\nas a misreading of al-Kindi, actually mirrors a passage in John of\nDamascus’ (c. 676–c. 749) De Fide Orthodoxa, which was\ntranslated into Arabic in the tenth century (Wolfson, 1961:\n279–280). While it is within the realm of possibility that\nIsraeli read this translation, it is also possible that both authors\nare citing a previous source which is no longer extant. \n\nA clear and strong influence of the Arab philosopher al-Kindi (d.\n873) is evident in the work of Isaac Israeli. Like the former, he\nwrote a book of definitions, many of which are strongly similar to\ndefinitions in al-Kindi’s Fi Hudud al-ashya’\nwa-rusumiha. Scholars Altmann and Stern illustrate the extensive\nsimilarities between the two books in their commentary on\nIsraeli’s Book of Definitions in their study Isaac\nIsraeli: A Neoplatonic Philosopher of the Early Tenth\nCentury. Further, Israeli uses much of\nal-Kindi’s terminology for both astronomical and terrestrial\nobjects. Nonetheless, it would be wrong to call the book a\nparaphrase of al-Kindi, as there are numerous divergences as\nwell. \n\nThough we see overlap with The Theology of Aristotle and\nal-Kindi, we do not have any evidence that Israeli read the works of\nhis younger contemporary al-Farabi (ca. 870–ca. 950), nor do we see\nthe influence of his younger coreligionist philosopher Saadya Gaon\n(882–942 C.E.). \n\nThe four kinds of inquiry, introduced by Aristotle in his\nPosterior Analytics, and subsequently modified by Neoplatonist\ncommentators, were such a universal and fundamental component of the\ncultural episteme, that elaboration of the four inquiries\noften formed part of the introduction to philosophical and medical\ntreatises. Aristotle lists the four questions thusly: \n\n“(1) whether the connexion of an attribute with a thing is a\nfact, (2) what is the reason of the connexion, (3) whether a thing\nexists, (4) what is the nature of the thing.” (Posterior\nAnalytics ii.1, G.R.G. Mure translation) \n\nFollowing the practice of thinkers of his age, at the very beginning\nof his Book of Definitions and also at the beginning of his\nBook on Fevers, Isaac Israeli introduces the Aristotelian\ndistinction of the four kinds of inquiry, in a slightly modified\nform: \n\n“(1) The first is existence: when one inquires whether\nso-and-so exists; (2) the second is quiddity: when one inquires what\nso-and-so is; (3) the third is quality: when one inquires how so-and-so\nis; (4) the fourth is ‘quarity’: when one inquires why\nso-and-so is.” (Altmann and Stern, Isaac Israeli, pp.\n10–11) \n\nIsraeli’s description mirrors the list of al-Jahiz (d. ca.\n869) in the Book of Indications and Considerations (Arabic:\nKitab al-Dala’il wa’l-cItibar) as well\nas cAli ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari (fl. 9th\ncentury), in his medical text Firdaws al-Hikmah fi\nal-Tibb. His list varies slightly from that of al-Kindi, who\nin his treatise on metaphysics Al-Falsafah al-cula\ndefines the third inquiry as which, rather than\nhow. \n\nJust as medieval thinkers adopted Aristotle’s four inquiries,\nso too did they adopt his distinction of four types of causes\n(material, formal, efficient, and final) elaborated in\nAristotle’s Metaphysics v.2 and other\nplaces. Although Israeli adopts the schema, he notes that\nwithin each of the four categories a cause can be either spiritual or\ncorporeal. While a “spiritual material cause” might\nsound oxymoronic to our ears, in his Book of Definitions\nIsraeli provides an example: \n\nJust as spiritual material causes are the material substratum for\ngenera, spiritual formal causes are substantial forms of genera.\nThese genera “cause” those objects which partake of them to\nbe as they are. Israeli’s example of a spiritual efficient\ncause is paradoxical: \n\nThe prevalent medieval conception of the sphere of the cosmos is\nthat it is not a vacuum, but rather, crystalline and composed of a\nfifth element superior to the four elements of our terrestrial\nworld. Hence, it would appear that the efficient spiritual cause\ncould also be an efficient material cause. However, this\ndifficulty is resolved if what Israeli meant here was an intelligence\nor soul governing the sphere. Although Israeli does not in any of\nhis surviving writings and fragments mention a soul of the spheres, his\npupil Dunash Ibn Tamim affirms it in his commentary on Sefer\nYetzirah. \n\nIsraeli adopts the Aristotelian doctrine of the four elements which\ncompose all material objects: earth, air, fire and water. These\nelements are generated by the motion of the heavenly sphere, and they\ninhere in a material substratum—though Israeli does not elucidate\nits nature. Although Israeli does not explicitly state that the\nelements are made up of form and matter, Altmann and Stern (Isaac\nIsraeli, p. 183) present a strong case for his acceptance of this\nidea. In his Mantua Text, also known as the Chapter\non the Elements, he describes the generative order of the\nelements. The motion of the sphere of the world generated heat,\nand thus is fire brought into existence. As fire cooled, it\nbecame air, which, moving away from fire, cooled and moistened into\nwater, and as water moved from air it cooled and dried and generated\nearth (Altmann and Stern, Isaac Israeli, pp. 120–121). \n\nSimilar to most other Neoplatonists, Israeli accepted the\nAristotelian definition of a substance as a something of which\nsomething is said or predicated—and not something which is said\nof something else. Within a substance, matter is the substratum\nfor the form which determines its being as substance. Further\nmatter can be either particular or general and universal, and if\nparticular “it is the substratum for a special form which\nconstitutes the essence of a particular species…”\n(Isaac Israeli, p. 86) \n\nAlthough explication of the nature of God is absent in the surviving\nfragments of Israeli’s philosophical corpus, it is apparent that\nIsraeli, like the Muslim philosopher al-Kindi before him, combined the\nNeoplatonist notion of God as the source of emanation of all things,\nwith the idea common to the monotheistic religions, of a willful\nCreator who created the world in time. In blending these two\nconceptions, these philosophers rejected the Aristotelian conception of\nthe eternity of the world, as well as the idea of eternal emanation of\nsome of the Greek Neoplatonists. Israeli’s use of the\nArabic term, al-Bari, “the Creator” reflects the\nreligious sensitivities of his age—and is not simply a\ntranslation of Plotinus’ “The One”. \n\nIn Plotinus’ Enneads, the founding text of\nNeoplatonist philosophy, The One contains a will which is not\nseparate from itself (Enneads, vi 8.21), and precedes the\nemanation of Nous (The Intellect/Intelligence) a secondary\nentity from which all lower beings emanate. In Arabic paraphrases\nof Plotinus, the Will or Word of God is a secondary\nhypostasis which creates Intellect (cAql).\nThis model is also seen in later Jewish Neoplatonist philosophers\nSolomon Ibn Gabirol and Judah Halevi. However, Isaac Israeli,\nlike Plotinus, does not treat the will of God as a separate hypostasis\nor secondary being. \n\nOne prominent feature in most variants of Neoplatonist thought is\nNegative Theology, the idea that one cannot predicate anything of\nGod. The problems which this approach intended to avoid were two\nundesired implications arising from predication of a quality of\nGod—namely, that if we attribute a particular quality to God,\nthis quality exists co-extensively with God, and must hence be\nco-eternal; secondly, it introduces multiplicity to God. The\nNeoplatonists, in the main, wished to conceive of God as a simple and\nradical unity, preceding all multiplicity in the world, and as such,\nmust precede the existence of qualities. Hence the only two\nallowable predications of God are God’s Unity and God’s\nExistence. In none of the surviving materials do we find Israeli\nexpressing Negative Theology explicitly. Israeli’s pupil\nDunash Ibn Tamim promotes negative theology in his commentary on the\nmystical work Sefer Yetzirah, which lead scholars Altmann and\nStern (Isaac Israeli, pp. 157–8) to conclude that we can\nsafely assume that Israeli held this opinion as well. \n\nWhereas for Plotinus, the second being in the emanative chain is\nNous (Intellect), Israeli concurs with the model in “Ibn\nHasday’s Neoplatonist”, that First Matter and First Form\nare the first and only “creations” of the\nCreator—that is, produced by an act of Will—and\nprecede the Intellect. First Matter and First Form conjoin to\nform the First Intellect. After God creates First Matter and First\nForm, God’s active role in creation ceases and all subsequent\nbeings emanate in a chain of hypostases from Intellect, downward to the\nthree kinds of soul, and culminating in the material and corporeal\nSphere/Nature. Further, Israeli adds a second Intellect which is\na distinct hypostasis from First Intellect. First Intellect\ncontains the totality of forms and knows itself intuitively with\nperfect unchanging knowledge. Second Intellect exists within the\ndomain of Soul, and knows the actualization of particular things via\ntemporal knowledge. \n\nSoul is the next realm in the emanative sequence, and Israeli here\nreplicates Aristotle’s threefold division. This universal\nsoul is made up of the higher Rational Soul, the Animal Soul and the\nVegetative/Nutritive Soul and from these emanates the superlunary\nsphere of heaven—the point where the material world emerges from\nSoul. Whereas most other Neoplatonists use the term\n“Nature” for the corporeal world, Israeli uses the term\n“the sphere.” The motions of the superlunary sphere\nof heaven, made up of a fifth unchanging element, govern the\ncombinations and recombinations of the four elements in the material\nworld below the moon—hence they govern the processes of\ngeneration and corruption. Israeli’s student Dunash Ibn\nTamim calls this fourth soul the soul of the sphere. \n\nIn Neoplatonist philosophy the metaphor of light emitted from its\nsource illustrates the process of emanation. The light spreads\nout from its source, but does not diminish its source. Similarly,\nthe generation of emanated entities and hypostases in no way diminishes\nthe source of each emanation. Israeli accounts for the increasing\ncorporeality and particularity and imperfection of each emanated\nhypostasis by adding the idea of shadow or shade to emanation.\nEach emanated hypostasis has a lighter region closer to the source of\nits emanation, but it also contains regions of shade or shadow in areas\nfurther from their source. It is in these shaded regions that the\nemanation of the next sequential entity begins. Further, each\nemanated hypostasis receives light from its source but also shadow,\nwhich grows denser as the ontological distance from the source of\nemanation increases. \n\nAs is standard within the intellectual milieu dominated by\nAristotelian physics, Israeli opined that the generation and passing\naway of terrestrial objects was the result of recombination of elements\nand their attendant properties (heat, coldness, wetness and dryness), a\nprocess which is governed by the movement of the cosmic sphere.\nLater thinkers would, via astrology, attribute certain roles in this\nprocess to the “intelligences” governing individual\ncelestial objects and their relative positions. The heavens,\nwhich are not composed of the four elements and hence not affected by\ntheir contrary qualities, are not subject to generation and\ndegeneration. (Isaac Israeli [Book of Definitions],\np. 48) \n\nIn a few instances in his Book of Definitions, Israeli\ndiverges from models given by his forerunner al-Kindi. Although Israeli\nposits a first intellect and a second intellect,\nIsraeli describes three hypostases of intellect. First\nintellect, the entity which emerges from the conjunction of first\nmatter and first form, contains all subsequent forms, which emanate\nfrom the first intellect and determine the specificality of\nall substances and knows all things eternally. The secondary\nhypostasis of intellect is actually in the rational soul, and is\npotential intellect before it passes into the actual intellect of the\nfirst intellect. The “second intellect” (actually the\nthird hypostasis of intellect) is a faculty of the rational soul, which\nvia sense perception and imagination (the “internal\nsenses”) conveys information to the higher hypostasis in the\nrational soul. The second intellect of the rational soul unites\nwith the objects of its intellection in a spiritual, non-corporeal\nsense and similarly, upon conveyance of the intellection to the higher\nintellect of the rational soul, the higher hypostasis of intellect\nwithin the rational soul also spiritually unites with the objects of\nits intellection. (Altmann and Stern, Isaac Israeli, pp.\n36–7) Since Israeli here diverges from al-Kindi, Stern accuses\nIsraeli of a clumsy misreading of the latter. (Isaac Israeli,\np. 39) However, since Israeli’s description of internal\nsenses largely mirrors the description in John of Damascus’\nDe Fide Orthodoxa, (Book II, Chapter 20) it is likely that\nIsraeli derived his overall schema of intellection from another\nsource. While Stern rejected the connection between the text of\nJohn of Damascus and Israeli (Isaac Israeli, p. 59), Harry Wolfson\nrejoined that De Fida Orthodoxa was available in Arabic\ntranslation in the tenth century (Wolfson, 1961, p. 279).\nFurther, it is possible that Israeli was drew his conception from\nanother lost source common to himself and John of Damascus, or from a\nlost Arabic commentator on the latter. \n\nIsaac Israeli did not believe in the ensoulment of souls in\nbodies. The three souls, despite their role in the governance of\nthe body, and the role of bodily sense perception in conveying\ninformation to the rational soul, remained outside the body. In\nhis Book on Spirit and Soul, Israeli utilizes scriptural proof\ntexts to argue that the rational soul is what entitles mankind to\nreward or punishment after death. But he writes tersely and\nvaguely on the subject of reward and punishment and does not explicitly\nclarify the relationship between the generic rational soul and rational\nsouls of individuals. Presumably, we all have separate rational\nsouls, otherwise the idea of reward and punishment of rational souls\nmakes no sense. He notes that the perfect actions of man pass\nbeyond the corporeal sphere while those actions to satisfy bodily\nappetites do not. Further, he affirms that the soul of the\nrighteous will endure in the upper realm with the intellect.\nAlthough he has sidestepped the traditional Rabbinic Jewish conception\nof bodily resurrection of the righteous by stating that the world to\ncome is the upper non-physical world, he does not spell out whether\nthis dwelling entails reintegration of one’s rational soul with\nthe intellect, or a separate yet proximate existence. \n\nIsraeli, like the physician Qusta Ibn Luqa (ca. 835–912), argued\nthat in addition to its connection with souls, a living being has a\nvital spirit, which unlike souls, is contained within the body and dies\nwith the body, and he employs scripture (Psalms 78: 39) to argue this\npoint. Altmann and Stern show that Israeli’s text very\nclosely parallels Ibn Luqa’s, hence either derived it directly\nfrom the former, or they both are quoting the same prior source.\n(Isaac Israeli, p. 50) \n\nIn addition to an emanative/generative order, a prominent feature of\nNeoplatonist philosophy is the idea that through withdrawal from bodily\ndesires, and perfection of the intellect, one’s rational soul can\nattain unity with the higher world. The early\nNeoplatonists—those outside of the “revealed”\nmonotheistic traditions of Islam, Judaism and\nChristianity—suggest that it is possible for the rational soul to\nachieve unity with The One/God. However, the Neoplatonists who\nwere members of established monotheist religions do not think that\none’s rational soul is capable of so high an ascent up the\nemanative chain, and advocation of such belief might have lead to\nprosecution for blasphemy or heresy. Nonetheless, Neoplatonists\nof religious traditions did think that the rational soul’s union\nwith the realm of intellect was possible. Neoplatonists from\nProclus onwards describe unification as a three-part process, which\nAltmann and Stern characterize as\nPurification—Illumination—Union. For Israeli, the\nPurification stage involves three activities: an ascetic rejection of\nbodily desires and pleasures, and the dominance of the two lower souls;\na worship of God combined with ethical behavior towards one’s\nfellow men; and the study of philosophy to develop one’s rational\nsoul. In the second stage, the soul is illuminated by\ntruth. In the third stage, one’s rational soul becomes\nspiritual and divine, though not achieving full unity with the\nCreator. \nAccording to Israeli, a human being can act in a number of ways when\nfaced with a specific situation. The reason for this\nability is the capacity of discernment, and more specifically of\ncogitation and consideration. Due to these capacities people are able\nto acquire theoretical and practical knowledge and to differentiate between good and evil. Because animals do not\npossess intellectual capacities, they are limited to acting in a\ndefinite way in particular situations. However, the ability of humans to act in different ways is a\nconsequence of humans’ position between pure intellect and\nbeast. People use their cogitation and consideration to attain a\nhigher level of knowledge. However, as long as humans use those\ncapacities their knowledge will remain imperfect and they will\ncontinue to hesitate and be uncertain. When they are united with intellect they\nno longer are  uncertain and act in the best possible way in\nall situations without any tension in their soul. According to\nIsraeli, the certainty of truth cancels all kinds of bad temptations. \nOne may interpret Israeli here as saying that if a man has an imperfect knowledge that it is bad to eat\nunhealthy candies, his knowledge and his temptation for these candies\nare in struggle in his soul. His capacities of consideration and\ncogitation (אלפכר) have to decide between this imperfect knowledge and\nthe temptation. Once this person attains perfect knowledge, he or she\nno longer wishes to eat the candies. S. Sadik argues that Israeli’s remarks constitute a Socratic negation of akrasia (Sadik 2013). \n\nAll of the following works, except the Book on the\nElements, have been translated by Alexander Altmann and S. M.\nStern in their monograph Isaac Israeli: A Neoplatonic Philosopher\nof the Early Tenth Century. In the 1950s and 1960s these two\nscholars have also published transcriptions of the fragments and\nmanuscripts of these works in a number of journals. In addition\nto publishing and translating known works of Isaac Israeli, Altmann and\nStern firmly established the hypothesis suggested by Gershom Scholem\nthat Isaac Israeli authored a work previously erroneously attributed to\nAristotle: The Chapter on the Elements (Mantua Text).\nFurther, in their extensive analyses of Israeli’s texts (in which\nthey often compare Israeli’s text to parallel passages in\nal-Kindi and other authors), they established the surprising antiquity\nof the Neoplatonic treatise which Abraham Ibn Hasday (d. 1240) appended\nto his Hebrew translation of The Prince and the Ascetic.\nThis work, which they dubbed “Ibn Hasday’s\nNeoplatonist” actually predated and influenced both Isaac Israeli\nand the Longer Recension of the Theology of Aristotle, and\nStern’s article on “Ibn Hasday’s Neoplatonist”\nis an important component of any thorough study of the philosophy of\nIsaac Israeli. \n\nOriginally written in Arabic, this work is extant in two Latin\n(Liber de Definicionibus/Definitionibus) and two Hebrew\ntranslations (Sefer ha-Gvulim), but only a fragment of the\noriginal Arabic (Kitab al-Hudud) survived. That\nthis book was widely read by Christian scholastics is evidenced by\nThomas Aquinas’ and Albertus Magnus’ misattribution of\nAvicenna’s definition of truth to Isaac’s Book of\nDefinitions (see Altmann & Stern, Isaac Israeli, p.\n59). This book is a collection of 57 definitions, the bulk of\nwhich are paraphrases and quotes (often without attribution) of various\npassages of al-Kindi. In some instances, he cites “the\nphilosopher” who would be understood to mean Aristotle, but he is\nactually paraphrasing al-Kindi, who oftentimes purports to elucidate\nwhat Aristotle had written on a particular subject.\nOccasionally, his definitions derive from other possible sources such\nas Qusta ibn Luqa (a physician, mathematician, scientist and\ntranslator, lived 835–912 C.E.), Ammonius Hermiae of Alexandria (Fifth\nCentury C.E.) and John Philoponus (490–ca. 570 C.E.). A few ideas\nexpressed in this work are not attested in any other known\nsources. Yet, because of the book’s close adherence to\nal-Kindi, Stern hypothesizes that these deviations are often either\nquotation of definitions of al-Kindi which have been lost, or are\nmisreadings of al-Kindi. One of the colophons at the end noted\nthat the work is a “collection,” perhaps indicating that\nthe material was not original, nor intended to be read as such.\nIn another manuscript the colophon asserts that Isaac Israeli had\nwritten it, yet this same colophon contains spurious\ninformation—that Israeli was from Spain and that he had fathered\nchildren whom he hoped would study it (Altmann & Stern, Isaac\nIsraeli, p. 78), hence its claim that the treatise is an entirely\noriginal work of Israeli’s must not be regarded as\nauthoritative. \n\nBoth Latin versions were published by J.T. Muckle, “Issac\nIsraeli, Liber de Definicionibus” in Archives\nd’histoire doctrinale et litteraire du moyen age,\n1937–8. The longer version was translated by Gerard of Cremona\n(1114–1187), and appears in manuscripts (Paris B.N. 14,700; Paris B.N.\n6443; Vatican Lat. 2186) as well as a printed edition Omnia opera\nYsaac, from Lyons in 1515. M. Alonso speculated that the\nshorter version (MS Munich Lat. 8001) is a translation by Domingo\nGundissalinus and predated the longer version (Alonso, 1947, pp. 295,\n325) (See “Traducciones del arcediano Domingo Gundisalvo”\nin Al-Andalus, 1947, pp. 295, 325). Altmann and Stern\nchallenge this hypothesis, arguing that the shorter version is an\nepitome of the longer version, improving the translation at points\n(Isaac Israeli, p. 5). \n\nNissim ben Solomon translated one of the Hebrew versions, and it can\nbe found in its entirety in H. Hirschfeld, Festschrift zum 80.\nGeburtstag M. Steinschneiders, pp. 131–42. J.L. Teicher was\nof the opinion that the Hebrew version was translated from the Latin\nversion (See “The Latin-Hebrew school of translators in Spain in\nthe twelfth century,” in Homanaje a Millas-Vallicrosa,\nv.ii, pp. 416–22). Julius Guttman and Stern think that his\nprimary source was the Arabic version (Stern and Altmann, Isaac\nIsraeli, p. 6). The second Hebrew translation, whose\ntranslator is unknown, was published by Altmann in Journal of\nSemitic Studies, 1957, pp. 232–42. \n\nThe surviving Arabic fragment is written in Hebrew characters, but\nthere are indications that the original text was written in Arabic\nscript. The Arabic fragment can be found in the Cambridge\nTaylor-Schechter collection, document TS. 8 Ka.62 and has\nbeen published twice—by H. Hirschfeld in “The Arabic\nportion of the Cairo Genizah at Cambridge,” Jewish Quarterly\nReview xv (1902), pp. 689–93 and by Altmann in Journal of Semitic\nStudies, 1957, pp. 232–42. This work is accessible in\nEnglish translation with commentary in Altmann and Stern’s\nIsaac Israeli, 9–78. \n\nThe Book of Substances (Arabic: Kitab al-Jawahir)\nis extant only in fragments of Judeo-Arabic (that is, Arabic written in\nHebrew letters) in the Firkovitch Collection in St. Petersburg and in\nthe British Museum. Stern established that both manuscripts were\nseparately transliterated from an original text in Arabic\ncharacters—which is deducible from transcription errors arising\nfrom Arabic rather than Hebrew orthographic similarities, and that the\ntranscription and transliteration errors in the two manuscripts do not\nmatch (Stern, “The Fragments of ‘The Book of\nSubstances’”, pp.16–17). Stern pieced together the fragments,\nadding some missing materials from a passage in “Ibn\nHasday’s Neoplatonist” and published them in the\nJournal of Jewish Studies, vii (1956), 13–29. The extant\nfragments largely paraphrase and add commentary to passages from the\npseudo-Aristotelian “Ibn Hasday’s\nNeoplatonist.” Due to the close textual proximities between\nthe two texts, Stern conjectured that in places where Israeli is\nquoting “the philosopher” he is likely quoting a lost\npassage of the Neoplatonist. These parallels allowed Stern to\narrange the discontinuous fragments into an order mirroring its source\ntreatise. Altmann and Stern subsequently published a translation of the\nfragments in Isaac Israeli, pp. 81–105. \n\nJ.L. Teicher argues that Isaac Israeli is not the author of this\nwork (Teicher, 1956 p. 424). However, since\nIsraeli’s pupil Dunash Ibn Tamim quotes passages of it in his\ncommentary on the mystical work Sefer Yetzirah,\nTeicher’s view is likely erroneous. \n\nTwo Hebrew translations (Sefer ha-Ruah v’ha-Nefesh)\nand a fragment of the Arabic original remain of this work.\nAltmann and Stern provide a critical English translation based on the\nHebrew manuscripts (Munich Steinschneider’s Cat. no. 307, fols.\n47ff; Cambridge Addler 1858 fols. 113v ff.) and A. Borisov’s\npublication of the Arabic fragment in Isaac Israeli, pp.\n108–117. \n\nThis treatise, unlike the Book of Definitions and Book\nof Substances is a distinctly Jewish work of philosophy, as it\ncombines doctrines of soul drawn from Ibn Hasday’s Neoplatonist\nwith Jewish scriptural proof texts, supporting a Neoplatonist\nconception of soul as distinct from mortal spirit, combined with the\nRabbinic Jewish belief in reward and punishment of souls. \n\nA single Hebrew translation (Shacar ha-Yesodot\nle-Aristo) is extant in manuscript Mantua 28c, folios\n16r–18r. This unsigned work was initially regarded as an\nanonymous commentary on Aristotle. Altmann, developing a hypothesis\nfirst proposed by Gershom Scholem, argues that this text is the work of\nIsaac Israeli. Also called the Mantua Text, it is\navailable in English translation by Altmann in two\npublications—Journal of Jewish Studies, vii (1956) pp.\n31–57 and in Altmann and Stern’s Isaac Israeli, pp.\n119–32. \n\nLike most of his other philosophical works, Israeli’s Arabic\noriginal (Kitab al-Ustuqussat) is lost, and we are left with a\nLatin translation and two Hebrew versions. Gerard of Cremona’s\nLatin translation of this book was published in the work Omnia\nopera Ysaac, Lyons: 1515. One Hebrew version (Leiden, Warner MS\nNo. 13) was rendered by Abraham ibn Hasday for David Qimhi. The\nother translation (Munich MS No. 43) is more eloquent, and likely an\nimprovement on the earlier translation, leading Salomon Fried to\nconjecture that the famous Medieval translator Moses ibn Tibbon\n(flourished mid-13th century, Provence) prepared it (Fried,\n1884, pp. 75–83). \n\nIn 956, Dunash Ibn Tamim, a pupil of Isaac Israeli, wrote an\nextensive commentary on the short recension of Sefer Yetzirah,\na mystical work of cosmogony which attributes great importance to the\nletters of the Hebrew alphabet and their combinations in determining\nthe structure of the universe. In this work he cites Israeli so\nextensively that in the nineteenth century, a few scholars\nmisidentified the commentary as Israeli’s. \n\nIsaac Israeli’s medical treatises were studied for several\ncenturies both in the original Arabic and in Latin\ntranslation. In the eleventh century, Constantine\nAfricanus, a professor at the prestigious Salerno school of medicine,\ntranslated some of Israeli’s works into Latin. Many medieval\nArabic biographical chronicles of physicians list him and his\nworks. \n\nIsraeli’s philosophical works exercised a considerable\ninfluence on Christian and Jewish thinkers, and a lesser degree of\ninfluence among Muslim intellectuals. In the twelfth century,\nfollowing a major phase of the Christian reconquest of Spain, a group\nof scholars in Toledo transmitted many Arabic works of science and\nphilosophy into Latin. One of the translators who migrated to\nthis cultural center, Gerard of Cremona, rendered Israeli’s\nBook of Definitions and Book on the Elements into\nLatin. Israeli’s work was quoted and paraphrased by a\nnumber of Christian thinkers including Gundissalinus, Albertus Magnus,\nThomas Aquinas, Vincent de Beauvais, Bonaventura, Roger Bacon and\nNicholas of Cusa (See Altmann and Stern, Isaac Israeli, pp.\nxiii–xiv; Julius Guttmann, Die Scholastik des 13.\nJahrhunderts in irhen Beziehungen zum Judentum und zur judische\nLiteratur, pp. 55–60, 129–30,150 and 172; as well as Guttmann,\nDas Verhaltniss des Thomas von Aquino zum Judentum und zur\njudischen Literatur, pp. 55–60). \n\nIsaac Israeli corresponded with Saadya ben Joseph al-Fayyumi\n(882–942) prior to the latter’s departure from Egypt. Saadya\nlater became the head (Gaon) of the Talmudic Academy of Sura and one of\nthe most influential figures in the medieval Judaism. Saadya Gaon was\nknown for his Jewish legal rulings, his arrangement of the Jewish\nprayer book (Siddur), his translation of the Hebrew Bible into Arabic,\nhis liturgical poetry and his philosophical work The Book of\nBeliefs and Opinions (Arabic: Kitab al-‘Amanat\nwal-‘Itikadat, Hebrew: Sefer emunot\nve-decot). Altmann and Stern suggest\nthat it is possible that Saadya Gaon’s concept of rational\ncommandments was influenced by Israeli’s concept of\n“intellectual precepts” from his Book of\nDefinitions. (Isaac Israeli, p. 217) However, it is\nalso possible that Saadya Gaon’s conception may have been a\nproduct of the vibrant and somewhat ecumenical intellectual culture of\nBaghdad, in which a group of theologians known as the Muta‘zilites\nreconciled logic and science with Islamic theology, arguing for the\nrationality of God and His actions. \n\nThe great Jewish poet and Neoplatonist Solomon Ibn Gabirol (known in\nLatin as Avicebron and Avicebrol) likely read Isaac Israeli’s\nworks as well as the widely-circulated encyclopedic Epistles of the\nBrethren of Purity (Arabic: Rasa’il Ikhwan\nas-Safa’). Solomon Ibn Gabirol was at times close to\nthe latter in his models of emanation. He was also highly\ninnovative—hence the influence of Isaac Israeli is difficult to\ngauge. Nonetheless, Israeli’s Book on Spirit and\nSoul was likely the only philosophical text which combined\nNeoplatonist cosmology and psychology with Biblical proof texts—a\ntask which Ibn Gabirol accomplished so masterfully in his liturgical\npoem Keter Malkhut. It is probable that Ibn\nGabirol’s idea of spiritual matter was influenced by Israeli. \n\nAnother of the Golden Age Hebrew poets of Spain, Moses Ibn Ezra\n(c. 1060–1139) quotes Isaac Israeli without attribution in his\ntreatise The Book of the Garden, explaining the meaning of Metaphor\nand Literal Expression (Originally in Judeo-Arabic: Kitab\nal-Hadiqa fi Macna ‘l-Majaz\nwa’l-Haqiqa). Stern explores this matter in his\narticle “Isaac Israeli and Moses ibn Ezra.” The poet and\nphilosopher Joseph Ibn Tzaddiq of Cordoba (d. 1149) authored a work\nThe Microcosm (the Judeo-Arabic original is lost, but the work\nsurvived in Hebrew translation as Ha-colam\nha-Qatan) containing many ideas indebted to Israeli.\nParallels between the two thinkers are illuminated in Altmann and\nStern’s Isaac Israeli (pp. 30, 44, 73–74,\n117). \n\nIsaac Israeli’s philosophical influence on Muslim authors is\nslight at best. The only known quotation of Israeli’s\nphilosophy in a Muslim work occurs in Ghayat al-Hakim, a book\non magic, produced in eleventh-century Spain, translated into Latin and\nwidely circulated in the West under the title Picatrix.\nAlthough there are passages which correspond directly to\nIsraeli’s writings, the author does not cite him by name. \n\nAs Neoplatonist philosophy waned, in addition to the Galenic medical\ntradition of which Israeli was a part, the appreciable influence of\nIsaac Israeli diminished as well.","contact.mail":"navitshalom@hotmail.com","contact.domain":"hotmail.com"}]
