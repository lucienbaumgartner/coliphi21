There are now\nmany forms of structural realism and an extensive literature about\nthem. There are interesting connections with debates in metaphysics,\nphilosophy of physics and philosophy of mathematics. This entry is\nintended to be a comprehensive survey of the field.\n\n\n\nScientific realism is the view that we ought to believe in the\nunobservable entities posited by our most successful scientific\ntheories. It is widely held that the most powerful argument in favour\nof scientific realism is the no-miracles argument, according to which\nthe success of science would be miraculous if scientific theories were\nnot at least approximately true descriptions of the world. While the\nunderdetermination argument is often cited as giving grounds for\nscepticism about theories of unobservable entities, arguably the most\npowerful arguments against scientific realism are based on the history\nof radical theory change in science. The best-known of these arguments,\nalthough not necessarily the most compelling of them, is the notorious\npessimistic meta-induction, according to which reflection on the\nabandonment of theories in the history of science motivates the\nexpectation that our best current scientific theories will themselves\nbe abandoned, and hence that we ought not to assent to them. \n\nStructural realism was introduced into contemporary philosophy of\nscience by John Worrall in 1989 as a way to break the impasse that\nresults from taking both arguments seriously, and have “the best\nof both worlds” in the debate about scientific realism. With\nrespect to the case of the transition in nineteenth-century optics\nfrom Fresnel's elastic solid ether theory to Maxwell's theory of the\nelectromagnetic field, Worrall argues that: \n\nAccording to Worrall, we should not accept standard scientific\nrealism, which asserts that the nature of the unobservable objects that\ncause the phenomena we observe is correctly described by our best\ntheories. However, neither should we be antirealists about science.\nRather, we should adopt structural realism and epistemically commit\nourselves only to the mathematical or structural content of our\ntheories. Since there is (says Worrall) retention of structure across\ntheory change, structural realism both (a) avoids the force of the\npessimistic meta-induction (by not committing us to belief in the\ntheory's description of the furniture of the world) and (b) does\nnot make the success of science (especially the novel predictions of\nmature physical theories) seem miraculous (by committing us to the\nclaim that the theory's structure, over and above its empirical\ncontent, describes the world). \n\nWorrall's paper has been widely cited and has spawned an\nextensive literature in which various varieties of structural realism\nare advocated. These contemporary debates recapitulate the work of some\nof the greatest philosophers of science. Worrall says he found his\nstructural realism in Henri Poincaré (1905, 1906) whose\nstructuralism was combined with neo-Kantian views about the nature of\narithmetic and group theory, and with conventionalism about the\ngeometry of space and time. (The prevalence of Kantian themes in the\nliterature on structural realism is discussed further below; for more\non Poincaré see Giedymin 1982, Gower 2000 and Zahar 1994, 2001.)\nErnan McMullin (1990) argues that Pierre Duhem was a realist about the\nrelations found in laws but not about explanations in terms of an\nontology. According to Worrall (1989), Barry Gower (2000) and Elie\nZahar (2001), Duhem too was a kind of structural realist, though there\nare passages in Duhem that more readily lend themselves to an\ninstrumentalist interpretation. Gower's (2000) historical survey\nof structural realism also discusses how structuralism figures in the\nthought of Ernst Cassirer, Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap and Bertrand\nRussell. Stathis Psillos (1999) has explored the connections between\nstructuralism and the Ramsey-sentence approach to scientific theory as\nit figured in the development of Carnap's philosophy from logical\npositivism to ontologically relativist empiricism. Other important\npioneers of structuralism about science include Arthur Eddington (see\nFrench 2003), Grover Maxwell (see Ladyman 1998 and 3.1 below) and\nHermann Weyl (see Ryckman 2005). \n\nLadyman (1998) distinguished epistemic and ontic forms of structural\nrealism, and many of those who have taken up structural realism have\nbeen philosophers of physics who have developed the latter. Others have\nmade it clear that their structural realism is a purely epistemological\nrefinement of scientific realism. On the other hand, Bas van Fraassen\n(1997, 2006, 2008) defends an empiricist and non-realist form of\nstructuralism about science, motivated by an illuminating\nreconstruction of the origins of structuralism in the debate about the\nepistemology of physical geometry in the nineteenth century, and more\ngenerally in the progressive mathematisation of science. Yet more kinds\nof structuralism now abound in contemporary analytic philosophy. These\ninclude causal structuralism concerning the individuation of\nproperties, mathematical structuralism concerning the nature of\nmathematical objects, and structuralism about laws and dispositions.\nThe relationship between structural realism and these views is a matter\nfor further work. While many realists and antirealists alike are agreed\nthat the most viable form of scientific realism is structural realism,\nmany others continue to defend other forms of scientific realism. This\narticle reviews the issues and provides a guide for further\nreading. \n\nScientific realism became dominant in philosophy of science after\nthe demise of the forms of antirealism about science associated with\nthe logical positivists, namely semantic instrumentalism, according to\nwhich theoretical terms are not to be interpreted as referring to\nanything, and theoretical reductionism, according to which theoretical\nterms are disguised ways of referring to observable phenomena. These\nforms of antirealism rely upon discredited doctrines about scientific\nlanguage, such as that it can be divided into theoretical and\nobservational parts, and that much of it should not be taken literally.\nBas van Fraassen (1980) revitalised the debate about scientific realism\nby proposing his constructive empiricism as an alternative. His\nantirealism is sceptical rather than dogmatic, and does not depend on\nthe distinction between theoretical and observational terms. He allows\nthat terms such as ‘sub-atomic particle’ and\n‘particle too small to see’ are perfectly meaningful and\nshould be taken literally (note that the former term is theoretical and\nthe latter term is not but both purportedly refer to unobservable\nentities). On the other hand, he holds that it is perfectly rational to\nremain agnostic about whether there are any such particles because he\nargues that to accept the best scientific theories we have only\nrequires believing that they are empirically adequate, in the sense of\ncorrectly describing the observable world, rather than believing that\nthey are true simpliciter. (For more on constructive empiricism see\nMonton 2007.) \n\nHow then are we to decide whether to believe in the full theoretical\ntruth of scientific theories, including what they say about\nunobservable entities such as electrons and black holes, or whether to\nbelieve instead merely that our best scientific theories are\nempirically adequate? Van Fraassen argues that since the latter belief\nis logically weaker and yet as empirically contentful as the former belief\nit is natural for an empiricist to go only as far as belief in\nempirical adequacy. On the other hand, many philosophers are moved by\nthe fact that belief in only the empirical adequacy of our best\nscientific theories leaves us unable to explain the phenomena that they\ndescribe. Inference to the best explanation is widely believed to be an\nimportant form of reasoning in science, and the production of\nexplanations of the world is often supposed to be one of the main\nsuccesses of science. When the target of explanation becomes science\nitself and its history of empirical success as a whole, we arrive at\nthe no-miracles argument famously presented by Hilary Putnam as\nfollows: “The positive argument for realism is that it is the\nonly philosophy that doesn't make the success of science a\nmiracle” (1975, 73). \n\nThe no-miracles argument is elaborated in terms of specific features\nof scientific methodology and practice. Richard Boyd (1985, for\nexample) argues that in explaining the success of science, we need to\nexplain the overall instrumental success of scientific methods across\nthe history of science. Alan Musgrave (1988) says that the only version\nof the no-miracles argument that might work is one appealing to the\nnovel predictive success of theories. Some realists, such as Psillos\n(1999), have gone so far as to argue that only theories which have\nenjoyed novel predictive success ought to be considered as falling\nwithin the scope of arguments for scientific realism. \n\nColin Howson (2000), P.D. Magnus and Craig Callender (2004), and\nPeter Lipton (2004) have recently argued that the no-miracles argument\nis flawed because in order to evaluate the claim that it is probable\nthat theories enjoying empirical success are approximately true we have\nto know what the relevant base rate is, and there is no way we can know\nthis. Magnus and Callender argue that “wholesale” arguments\nthat are intended to support realism (or antirealism) about science as\na whole (rather than “retail” arguments that are applied to\na specific theory) are only taken seriously because of our propensity\nto engage in the ‘base rate fallacy’ of evaluating\nprobabilities without knowing all the relevant information. They think\nwe ought to abandon the attempt to defend scientific realism in general\nrather than on a case-by-case basis. \n\nWhen it comes to wholesale arguments against scientific\nrealism, perhaps the most influential until recently was the\nunderdetermination argument, according to which the existence of\nempirical equivalents to our best scientific theories implies that we\nshould withhold epistemic commitment to them. This is often dismissed\nby realists as generating doubt about unobservables that is no more\nworrying than doubting other minds or the external world. They argue\nthat since scientists find ways of choosing between empirically\nequivalent rivals, philosophers ought not to make too much of merely\nin-principle possibilities that are irrelevant to scientific practice\n(see Laudan and Leplin 1991, 1993, and Kukla 1998). (Kyle Stanford\n(2006) defends an underdetermination argument called ‘the\nproblem of unconceived alternatives’ with reference to the\nhistory of science, so perhaps not all underdetermination arguments\nare a priori and theoretical.) \n\nThe power of the arguments against scientific realism from theory\nchange is that, rather than being a priori and theoretical, they are\nempirically based and their premises are based on data obtained by\nexamining the practice and history of science. Ontological\ndiscontinuity in theory change seems to give us grounds not for mere\nagnosticism but for the positive belief that many central theoretical\nterms of our best contemporary science will be regarded as\nnon-referring by future science. So-called ‘pessimistic\nmeta-inductions’ about theoretical knowledge take many forms and\nare probably almost as ancient as scepticism itself. They have the basic\nform: \n\nMore precisely, Larry Laudan (1981) gave a very influential argument\nwith the following structure: \n\nSo, by induction we have positive reason to expect that our best\ncurrent theories will be replaced by new theories according to which\nsome of the central theoretical terms of our best current theories do\nnot refer, and hence we should not believe in the approximate truth or\nthe successful reference of the theoretical terms of our best current\ntheories. \n\nThe most common realist response to this argument is to restrict\nrealism to theories with some further properties (usually, maturity,\nand novel predictive success) so as to cut down the inductive base\nemployed in (i) (see Psillos 1996). Moreover Peter Lewis (2001), Marc\nLange (2002) and Magnus and Callender (2004) regard the pessimistic\nmeta-induction as a fallacy of probabilistic reasoning. However, there\nare arguments from theory change that are not probabilistic. Note first\nthat there are several cases of mature theories which enjoyed novel\npredictive success, notably the ether theory of light and the caloric\ntheory of heat. If their central theoretical terms do not refer, the\nrealist's claim that approximate truth explains empirical success\nwill no longer be enough to establish realism, because we will need\nsome other explanation for the success of the caloric and ether theories.\nIf this will do for these theories then it ought to do for others where\nwe happened to have retained the central theoretical terms, and then we\ndo not need the realist's preferred explanation that such\ntheories are true and successfully refer to unobservable entities. \n\nLaudan's paper was also intended to show that the successful\nreference of its theoretical terms is not a necessary condition for the\nnovel predictive success of a theory (1981, 45), and there are\ncounter-examples to the no-miracles argument. \n\nThere are two common (not necessarily exclusive) responses to\nthis: (I) Develop an account of reference according to which the\nabandoned theoretical terms are regarded as successfully referring\nafter all. \n\nRealists developed causal theories of reference to account for\ncontinuity of reference for terms like ‘atom’ or\n‘electron’, even though the theories about atoms and\nelectrons have undergone significant changes. The difference with the terms\n‘ether’ and ‘caloric’ is that they are no\nlonger used in modern science. However, as C.L. Hardin and Alexander\nRosenberg (1982) argue, the causal theory of reference may be used to\ndefend the claim that terms like ‘ether’ referred to whatever\ncauses the phenomena responsible for the terms' introduction.\nThis is criticized by Laudan (1984) as making the reference of\ntheoretical terms a trivial matter, since as long as some phenomena\nprompt the introduction of a term it will automatically successfully\nrefer to whatever is the relevant cause (or causes). Furthermore, this\ntheory radically disconnects what a theorist is talking about from what\nshe thinks she is talking about. For example, Aristotle or Newton could\nbe said to be referring to geodesic motion in a curved spacetime when,\nrespectively, they talked about the natural motion of material objects,\nand the fall of a body under the effect of the gravitational force. \n\n(II) Restrict realism to those parts of theories that play an\nessential role in the derivation of subsequently observed (novel)\npredictions, and then argue that the terms of past theories which are\nnow regarded as non-referring were non-essential and hence that there\nis no reason to deny that the essential terms in current theories will\nbe retained.  Philip Kitcher says that: “[n]o sensible realist\nshould ever want to assert that the idle parts of an individual\npractice, past or present, are justified by the success of the\nwhole” (1993, 142).   \n\nThe most detailed and influential response to the argument from\ntheory change is due to Psillos (1999), who combines strategies (I) and\n(II). Hasok Chang (2003), Kyle Stanford (2002 and 2003), Mohammed\nElsamahi (2005) and Timothy Lyons (2006) criticize Psillos's\naccount. Other responses include Kitcher's (1993) model of\nreference according to which some tokens of theoretical terms refer and\nothers do not. Christina McLeish (2005) criticizes Kitcher's\ntheory by arguing that there are no satisfactory grounds for making the\ndistinction between referring and non-referring tokens. McLeish (2006)\nargues that abandoned theoretical terms like ‘ether’\npartially refer and partially fail to refer. Juha Saatsi (2005) denies\npremise (a) and claims that there can be approximate truth of the\ncausal roles postulated by a scientific theory without its central\nterms necessarily successfully referring (see also Chakravartty, 1998). \n\nThere is no consensus among those defending standard realism in the\nface of theory change. The argument from theory change threatens\nscientific realism because if what science now says is correct, then\nthe ontologies of past scientific theories are far from accurate\naccounts of the furniture of the world. If that is so even though they\nwere predictively successful, then the success of our best current\ntheories does not mean they have got the nature of the world right\neither. The structuralist solution to this problem is to give up the\nattempt to learn about the nature of unobservable entities from\nscience. The metaphysical import of successful scientific theories\nconsists in their giving correct descriptions of the structure of the\nworld. Theories can be very different and yet share all kinds of\nstructure. The task of providing an adequate theory of approximate\ntruth that fits the history of science and directly addresses the\nproblem of ontological continuity has hitherto defeated realists, but\na much more tractable problem is to display the structural\ncommonalities between different theories. Hence, a form of realism\nthat is committed only to the structure of theories might not be\nundermined by theory change. Gerhard Schurz (2009) proves a structural\ncorrespondence theorem showing that successive theories that share\nempirical content also share theoretical content. (McArthur (2011)\nargues that structural realism eliminates both theory change in\nscience and scientific discovery.) \n\nThere are numerous examples of continuity in the mathematical\nstructure of successive scientific theories. Indeed Niels Bohr and\nothers explicitly applied the methodological principle known as the\n‘correspondence principle’, according to which\nquantum-mechanical models ought to mathematically reduce to classical\nmodels in the limit of large numbers of particles, or the limit of\nPlanck's constant becoming arbitrarily small. There are many cases in\nquantum mechanics where the Hamiltonian functions that represent the\ntotal energy of mechanical systems imitate those of classical\nmechanics, but with variables like those that stand for position and\nmomentum replaced by Hermitian operators. Simon Saunders (1993a)\ndiscusses the structural continuities between classical and quantum\nmechanics and also shows how much structure Ptolemaic and Copernican\nastronomy have in common.  Harvey Brown (1993) explains the\ncorrespondence between Special Relativity and classical\nmechanics. Jonathan Bain and John Norton (2001) discuss the structural\ncontinuity in descriptions of the electron, as does Angelo Cei\n(2004). Votsis (2011) considers examples of continuity and\ndiscontinuity in physics.\n\nRobert Batterman (2002) discusses many examples of limiting\nrelationships between theories, notably the renormalization group\napproach to critical phenomena, and the relationship between wave and\nray optics. Holger Lyre (2004) extends Worrall's original example of\nthe continuity between wave optics and electromagnetism by considering\nthe relationship between Maxwellian electrodynamics and Quantum\nElectrodynamics. Saunders (2003c and d) also criticises Tian Cao\n(1997) for underestimating the difficulties with a non-structuralist\nform of realism in the light of the history of quantum field\ntheory. \n\nThe most minimal form of structuralism focuses on empirical\nstructure, and as such is best thought of as a defence of the\ncumulative nature of science in the face of Kuhnian worries about\nrevolutions (following Post 1971). See Katherine Brading's and\nElaine Landry's (2006) ‘minimal structuralism’, and\nOtavio Bueno's (1999, 2000) and van Fraassen's (2006, 2007,\n2008) structural empiricism (Ryckman 2005 calls the latter\n“instrumental structuralism”). \n\nStructural realism is often characterised as the view that\nscientific theories tell us only about the form or structure of the\nunobservable world and not about its nature. This leaves open the\nquestion as to whether the natures of things are posited to be\nunknowable for some reason or eliminated altogether. Hence, Ladyman\n(1998) raised the question as to whether Worrall's structural\nrealism is intended as a metaphysical or epistemological modification\nof standard scientific realism. Worrall's paper is ambiguous in\nthis respect. That he has in mind only an epistemic constraint on\nrealism—commitment to the structure of our best scientific\ntheories but agnosticism about the rest of the content—is\nsuggested by his citation of Poincaré who talks of the redundant\ntheories of the past capturing the “true relations” between\nthe “real objects which Nature will hide forever from our\neyes” (1905, 161). So one way of thinking about structural\nrealism is as an epistemological modification of scientific realism to\nthe effect that we only believe what scientific theories tell us about\nthe relations entered into by unobservable objects, and suspend\njudgement as to the nature of the latter. (ESR is called\n‘restrictive structural realism’ by Psillos 2001.) There\nare various forms this might take. (See French and Ladyman 2011.) \n\nPsillos (2001) refers to the “upward path” to structural\nrealism as beginning with empiricist epistemological principles and\narriving at structural knowledge of the external world. The\n“downward” path is to arrive at structural realism by\nweakening standard scientific realism as suggested by Worrall. Both\npaths are criticized by Psillos. Russell (1927) was led along the\nupward path by three epistemological principles: firstly, the claim\nthat we only have direct access to our percepts (Ayer's\n‘egocentric predicament’); secondly, the principle that\ndifferent effects have different causes (which is called the\nHelmholtz-Weyl Principle by Psillos); and thirdly, that the relations\nbetween percepts have the same logico-mathematical structure as the\nrelations between their causes. This led him to the claim that science\ncan only describe the world up to isomorphism, and hence to (3) above\nsince according to him we know only the (second-order) isomorphism\nclass of the structure of the world and not the (first-order) structure\nitself. Russell's upward path is defended by Votsis (2005). \n\nMauro Dorato argues for ESR on the grounds that structural realism\nneeds entity realism to be plausible (1999, 4). Most defenders of ESR\nassume that there must be individual objects and properties that are\nontologically prior to relational structure. Matteo Morganti differs\nfrom other epistemic structural realists by arguing for agnosticism\nabout whether there is a domain of individuals over and above\nrelational structure. \n\nAs mentioned above, Poincaré's structuralism had a Kantian\nflavour. In particular, he thought that the unobservable entities\npostulated by scientific theories were Kant's noumena or things in\nthemselves. He revised Kant's view by arguing that the latter can be\nknown indirectly rather than not at all because it is possible to know\nthe relations into which they enter. Poincaré followed the\nupward path to structural realism, beginning with the neo-Kantian goal\nof recovering the objective or intersubjective world from the world\nfrom the subjective world of private sense impressions: “what we\ncall objective reality is… what is common to many thinking\nbeings and could be common to all; … the harmony of\nmathematical laws” (1906, 14). However, he also followed the\ndownward path to structural realism arguing that the history of\nscience can be seen as cumulative at the level of relations rather\nthan objects. For example, between Carnot's and Clausius'\nthermodynamics the ontology changes but the Second Law of\nThermodynamics is preserved. While Worrall never directly endorses the\nKantian aspect of Poincaré's thought, Zahar's structural\nrealism is explicitly a form of Kantian transcendental idealism\naccording to which science can never tell us more than the structure\nof the noumenal world; the nature of the entities and properties of\nwhich it consists are epistemically inaccessible to us (as in (2)\nabove). Michaela Massimi (2011) develops a neo-Kantian perspective on\nstructural realism. \n\nFrank Jackson (1998), Rae Langton  (1998) and David Lewis\n(2009) also advocate views similar to ESR. Jackson refers to\n‘Kantian physicalism’ (1998: 23–24), Langton to\n‘Kantian Humility’, and Lewis to ‘Ramseyan\nHumility’. Peter Unger (2001) also argues that our knowledge of\nthe world is purely structural and that qualia are the non-structural\ncomponents of reality. Jackson argues that science only reveals the\ncausal / relational properties of physical objects, and that “we\nknow next to nothing about the intrinsic nature of the world. We know\nonly its causal cum relational nature” (1998: 24). Langton\nargues that science only reveals the extrinsic properties of physical\nobjects, and both then argue that their intrinsic natures, and hence\nthe intrinsic nature of the world, are epistemically\ninaccessible. Jackson points out that this inference can be blocked if\nthe natures of objects and their intrinsic properties are identified\nwith their relational or extrinsic properties, but argues that this\nmakes a mystery of what it is that stands in the causal\nrelations. Lewis' structuralism is based on the centrality he gives to\nthe Ramsey sentence reconstruction of scientific theories that is the\nsubject of the next section. \n\nA position called structural realism, that amounts to an\nepistemological gloss on traditional scientific realism, was advocated\nby Grover Maxwell (1962, 1970a, 1970b, 1972). Maxwell wanted to make\nscientific realism compatible with “concept empiricism”\nabout the meaning of theoretical terms, and he also wanted to explain\nhow we can have epistemic access to unobservable entities. The problem\nas Maxwell saw it was that theories talk about all sorts of entities\nand processes with which we are not ‘acquainted’. How, he\nwondered, can we then know about and refer to them and their\nproperties? The answer that he gave, following Russell, was that we\ncan know about them by description, that is we can know them via their\nstructural properties. In fact, he argues, this is the limit of our\nknowledge of them, and the meanings of theoretical terms are to be\nunderstood purely structurally. The way that Maxwell explicates the\nidea that the structure of the theory exhausts the cognitive content\nof its theoretical terms, is to consider the Ramsey sentence of the\ntheory (Ramsey 1929). Ramsey's method allows the elimination of\ntheoretical terms from a theory by replacing them with existentially\nquantified predicate variables (or names in the case of the\ninfluential Lewis 1970). If one replaces the conjunction of assertions\nof a first-order theory with its Ramsey sentence, the observational\nconsequences of the theory are carried over, but direct reference to\nunobservables is eliminated. \n\nIf we formalise a theory in a first-order language:\n∏(O1,…,On;T1,…,Tm),\nwhere the Os are the observational terms and the Ts\nare the theoretical terms, then the corresponding Ramsey sentence is\n∃t1,…,tm∏(O1,…,On;t1,…,tm). Thus\nthe Ramsey sentence only asserts that there are some objects,\nproperties and relations that have certain logical features,\nsatisfying certain implicit definitions. It is a higher-order\ndescription, but ultimately connects the theoretical content of the\ntheory with observable behaviour. However, it is a mistake to think\nthat the Ramsey sentence allows us to eliminate theoretical entities,\nfor it still states that these exist. It is just that they are\nreferred to not directly, by means of theoretical terms, but by\ndescription, that is via variables, connectives, quantifiers and\npredicate terms whose direct referents are (allegedly) known by\nacquaintance. Thus Maxwell (and Russell) claimed that knowledge of the\nunobservable realm is limited to knowledge of its structural rather\nthan intrinsic properties, or, as is sometimes said, limited to\nknowledge of its higher-order properties. It is arguable that this is\nthe purest structuralism possible, for the notion of structure\nemployed refers to the higher-order properties of a theory, those that\nare only expressible in purely formal terms. \n\nThis is an epistemological structural realism meant to vindicate and\nnot to revise the ontological commitments of scientific realism. On\nthis view the objective world is composed of unobservable objects\nbetween which certain properties and relations obtain; but we can only\nknow the properties and relations of these properties and relations,\nthat is, the structure of the objective world. However, there are\nserious difficulties with this view which were originally raised by\nNewman in 1928 and which have been recently discussed by Demopoulos and\nFriedman (1989). The basic problem is that structure is not sufficient\nto uniquely pick out any relations in the world. Suppose that the world\nconsists of a set of objects whose structure is W with respect to some\nrelation R, about which nothing else is known. Any collection of things\ncan be regarded as having structure W provided there is the right\nnumber of them. This is because according to the extensional\ncharacterisation of relations defined on a domain of individuals, every\nrelation is identified with some set of subsets of the domain. The\npower set axiom entails the existence of every such subset and hence\nevery such relation. \n\nAs Demopoulos and Friedman point out, if ∏ is consistent, and\nif all its purely observational consequences are true, then the truth\nof the corresponding Ramsey sentence follows as a theorem of\nsecond-order logic or set theory (provided the initial domain has the\nright cardinality—and if it does not then consistency implies\nthat there exists one that does). The formal structure of a relation\ncan easily be obtained with any collection of objects provided there\nare enough of them, so having the formal structure cannot single out a\nunique referent for this relation; in order to do so we must stipulate\nthat we are talking about the intended relation, which is to go beyond\nthe structural description. “Thus on this view, only cardinality\nquestions are open to discovery!” (1989, 188); everything else\nwill be known a priori. \n\nThis leads Demopoulos and Friedman to conclude that reducing a\ntheory to its Ramsey sentence is equivalent to reducing it to its\nempirical consequences, and thus that: “Russell's realism\ncollapses into a version of phenomenalism or strict empiricism after\nall: all theories with the same observational consequences will be\nequally true” (1985, 635). Similarly, Jane English (1973) argued,\nthough on the basis of different considerations, that any two Ramsey\nsentences that are incompatible with one another cannot have all their\nobservational consequences in common. Hence it seems that if we treat a\ntheory just as its Ramsey sentence then the notion of theoretical\nequivalence collapses onto that of empirical equivalence. (Demopoulos\n2003 argues that similar considerations show that structural empiricism\nalso collapses truth to empirical adequacy; he also discusses the\nrelationship between Newman's problem and Putnam's Paradox.\nVotsis 2003 argues that the conclusion of the Newman argument\ndoesn't undermine ESR after all. Gordon Solomon 1989 defends\nRichard Braithwaite's claim that Eddington's structuralism\n(see 4.1 below) is vulnerable to Newman's argument.) \n\nJeffery Ketland (2004) argues in detail that the Newman objection\ntrivialises the Ramsey sentence formulation of ESR. Worrall and Zahar\n(2001) argue that the cognitive content of a theory is exhausted by\nits Ramsey sentences but that, while the Ramsey sentence only\nexpresses the empirical content of the theory, the notion of empirical\ncontent in play here is sufficient for a form of realism. In his 2007\npaper, Worrall sets out an account and defense of epistemic structural\nrealism and responds to objections that have been raised to it,\nincluding the Newman problem. Cruse (2005) and Melia and Saatsi (2006)\ndefend the Ramsey sentence approach against model-theoretic arguments\nby questioning the assumption that all predicates which apply to\nunobservables must be eliminated in favour of bound variables. Mixed\npredicates such as ‘extended’ are those that apply to both\nobservable and unobservable objects. The Newman objection does not go\nthrough if mixed predicates are not Ramsified, because a model of the\nRamsey sentence will not necessarily be one in which what is claimed\nregarding the mixed properties and relations holds. In response,\nDemopoulos (2008) points out that the Ramsey sentence of a theory with\nmixed predicates where the latter are not Ramsified will be true\nprovided the original theory is satisfied—hence the claim that\nthe content of the Ramsey sentence is merely the observational content\nof the original theory plus a cardinality claim is still true when\nmixed predicates are considered. Melia and Saatsi (2006) also argue\nthat intensional notions, such as naturalness and causal significance,\nmay be applied to properties to save the Ramsey sentence formulation\nof ESR from triviality. (This recalls the defence of Russell's\nstructuralism against Newman discussed in Hochberg 1994.) Demopoulos\nalso raises two problems with this strategy: firstly, even non-natural\nrelations can have significant claims made about them in a theory, and\nsecondly, the cognitive significance of unramsified theories is\nindependent of a commitment to ‘real’ or\n‘natural’ relations.  Hence, Demopoulos insists that the\nRamsey sentence of a theory and the theory itself are importantly\ndifferent (see also Psillos 2006b). Peter Ainsworth (2009) gives a\nclear and accessible account of the Newman problem and the responses\nthat have been given to it. In his (2011) Demopoulos argues that there\nare three very different views in the work of Russell, Ramsey, and\nCarnap respectively, which have in common versions of a core\nstructuralist thesis that he identifies. All the accounts he considers\nmake use of Ramsey sentences; Demopoulos investigates the logical\nproperties of the Ramsey sentence and arrives at an argument against\nthe structuralist thesis. Friedman (2011) argues that Carnap’s account\nof theoretical terms involving the Ramsey sentence approach is not\nvulnerable to the Newman problem. The relationship between Friedman's\nviews on the relativized a priori and structural realism is\ninterrogated in Ivanova (2011). \n\nVersions of ESR that employ the Ramsey sentence of a theory and the\ndistinction between observational and theoretical terms are embedded\nin the so-called syntactic view of theories that adopts first-order\nquantificational logic as the appropriate form for the representation\nof physical theories. According to Zahar (1994, 14) the continuity in\nscience is in the intension rather than the extension of its\nconcepts. He argues that if we believe that the mathematical structure\nof theories is fundamentally important for ontology, then we need a\nsemantics for theories that addresses the representative role of\nmathematics directly. Such an account of scientific representation is\nallegedly found in the so-called ‘semantic’ or\n‘model-theoretic’ approach associated primarily with\nPatrick Suppes, Fred Suppe, Ron Giere and Bas van Fraassen (see da\nCosta and French 2003). The relationship between structuralism and the\nsemantic view is discussed by van Fraassen (1997, 2008), and\nThomson-Jones (2011). Chris Pincock (2011) criticises structural\nrealism on the basis of an analysis of the role of mathematics in\nscientific representation. Ladyman (1998), and Ladyman and Ross (2007)\nargue that the Newman problem does not arise for ontic structural\nrealism since it eschews an extensional understanding of\nrelations. \n\nLadyman (1998) argues that in general epistemological forms of\nstructural realism do not significantly improve the prospects of\nstandard scientific realism and that hence structural realism should be\nthought of as metaphysically rather than merely epistemically\nrevisionary. Structural realism is supposed to help with the problem of\ntheory change. As Maxwell himself pointed out, his structural realism\nis a purely semantic and epistemological theory. The Ramsey sentence\npicks out exactly the same entities as the original theory. It does not\ndispense with reference, but it makes that reference a function of the\n(place of the theoretical terms in the) overall structure of the\ntheory, as manifested in the Ramsey sentence. The problem of\nontological discontinuity is left untouched by simply adopting\nRamsification. In fact, it seems even worse if contextualism about the\nmeaning of theoretical terms is adopted. Cei and French (2006) and\nCruse (2005) also argue, on different grounds, that Ramsification is of\nno help to the structural realist. \n\nWorrall's position in his 1989 paper is not explicitly an\nepistemic one, and other comments suggest a different view: “On\nthe structural realist view what Newton really discovered are the\nrelationships between phenomena expressed in the mathematical equations\nof his theory” (1989, 122). If the continuity in scientific\nchange is of “form or structure”, then perhaps we should\nabandon commitment to even the putative reference of theories to\nobjects and properties, and account for the success of science in other\nterms. Others who have contributed to structural realism have more\nexplicitly signalled a significant departure from traditional realist\nmetaphysics. For example, Howard Stein: \n\nA crude statement of ESR is the claim that all we know is the\nstructure of the relations between things and not the things\nthemselves, and a corresponding crude statement of OSR is the claim\nthat there are no ‘things’ and that structure is all there\nis (this is called ‘radical structuralism’ by van Fraassen\n2006). \n\nOSR has attracted most sympathy among some philosophers of physics\nand physicists. This is natural since, while Worrall's motivation\nfor introducing structural realism was solely the need for a realist\nresponse to the pessimistic meta-induction, French and Ladyman\nintroduced OSR to describe a form of structural realism motivated by\ntwo further problems: \n\nTheir concern with (a) followed that of many of the pioneers of\nstructuralism in twentieth-century philosophy of science including\nCassirer, Eddington and Weyl. (Russell's and Carnap's versions of\nstructuralism were more directly motivated by epistemological and\nsemantic problems than by ontological issues arising from physics.)\nFrench did seminal work on the identity and individuality of quantum\nparticles with Michael Redhead (who also wrote a classic paper on\ntheories and models (1980) and later endorsed structural realism as a\nway of interpreting quantum field theory (1999)). More recently it has\nbecome more widespread to advocate OSR as a response to contemporary\nphysics as a whole (for example, see Tegmark 2007). Among others who\nhave defended versions of OSR are Jonathan Bain (2003 and 2004),\nMichael Esfeld (2004) and Esfeld and Lam (2008), Aharon Kantorovich\n(2003), Holgar Lyre (2004), Gordon McCabe (2007) and John Stachel\n(2002 and 2006). Saunders and David Wallace have deployed\nstructuralism to solve the problem of how macroscopic objects with\nmore or less determinate properties can be recovered from the Everett\ninterpretation of quantum states (the so-called preferred basis\nproblem) (Saunders 1993b, 1995, and Wallace 2003). OSR is also further\nelaborated in Ladyman and Ross (2007) and defended against various\ncriticisms in French and Ladyman (2011).  Quantum gravity and\nstructuralism is discussed by an outstanding collection of\nphilosophers and physicists in Rickles, French and Saatsi (2006). \n\nOntic structural realists argue that what we have learned from\ncontemporary physics is that the nature of space, time and matter are\nnot compatible with standard metaphysical views about the ontological\nrelationship between individuals, intrinsic properties and relations.\nOn the broadest construal OSR is any form of structural realism based\non an ontological or metaphysical thesis that inflates the ontological\npriority of structure and relations. The attempt to make this precise\nsplinters OSR into different forms (three of these are discussed in\nAinsworth (2010) and he argues against two of them), and all of the\nfollowing claims have been advocated by some defenders of OSR at some\ntime: \n\n(1) Eliminativism: there are no individuals (but there is relational\nstructure) \n\nThis view is associated with French and Ladyman. The term\n‘eliminative structural realism’ comes from Psillos (2001).\nIt is criticised on the grounds that there cannot be relations without\nrelata. This objection has been made by various philosophers including\nCao (2003b), Dorato (1999), Psillos (2001, 2006), Busch (2003),\nMorganti (2004) and Chakravartty (1998, 2003) who says: “one\ncannot intelligibly subscribe to the reality of relations unless one is\nalso committed to the fact that some things are related” (1998,\n399). In other words, the question is, how can you have structure\nwithout individuals, or, in particular, how can we talk about a group\nwithout talking about the elements of a group? Even many of those\nsympathetic to the OSR of French and Ladyman have objected that they\ncannot make sense of the idea of relations without relata (see 2004,\nEsfeld and Lam 2008, Lyre 2004, and Stachel 2006). \n\nHowever, there are at least two ways to make sense of the idea of a\nrelation without relata: \n\n(I) The idea of a universal. For example, when we refer to the\nrelation referred to by ‘larger than’, it is because we\nhave an interest in its formal properties that are independent of the\ncontingencies of its instantiation. To say that all that there is are\nrelations and no relata, is perhaps to follow Plato and say that the\nworld of appearances is not properly thought of as part of the content\nof knowledge. (See Esfeld and Lam 2008: 5, and the opening\nepigram in Psillos 2006.) This Platonic version of OSR is perhaps what\nHoward Stein has in mind: \n\n(II) The relata of a given relation always turn out to be relational\nstructures themselves on further analysis. As Stachel puts it,\n“it's relations all the way down” (although he denies\nthe claim, 2006). See, Ladyman and Ross (2007) and Saunders (2003d,\n129). The idea that there may be no fundamental level to reality is\ndiscussed in Schaffer (2003). \n\nIn any case, eliminativism does not require that there be relations\nwithout relata, just that the relata not be individuals. French and\nKrause (2006) argue that quantum particles and spacetime points are\nnot individuals but that they are objects in a minimal sense, and they\ndevelop a non-classical logic according to which such non-individual\nobjects can be the values of first-order variables, but ones for which\nthe law of identity, ‘for all x, x is\nidentical to x’, does not hold (but neither does\n‘x is not identical to x’). There is no\nunanimity about the difference between individuals, objects and\nentities among philosophers but one neutral way of putting the issue\nis to ask whether there are only individual objects in the logical\nsense of object as the value of a first-order variable, or whether\nthere are individuals in some more substantive sense (for example,\nbeing subject to laws of identity, or being substances). Jonathan Bain\n(2013) argues that critics of radical ontic structural realism have\nimplicitly relied on a set-theoretic notion of structure and that a\ncategory theoretic formulation of ontic structural realism is useful\nin explicating the structure of physical theories, in particular,\ngeneral relativity. \n\n(2) There are relations (or relational facts) that do not supervene\non the intrinsic and spatio-temporal properties of their relata. \n\nThe interpretation of entangled states in quantum mechanics in terms\nof strongly non-supervenient relations goes back to Cleland (1984).\nHowever, the idea that there could be relations which do not supervene\non the non-relational properties of their relata runs counter to a\ndeeply entrenched way of thinking among some philosophers. The\nstandard conception of structure is either set theoretic or\nlogical. Either way it is often assumed that a structure is\nfundamentally composed of individuals and their intrinsic properties,\non which all relational structure supervenes. The view that this\nconceptual structure reflects the structure of the world is called\n“particularism” by Paul Teller (1989) and “exclusive\nmonadism” by Dipert (1997). It has been and is endorsed by many\nphilosophers, including, for example, Aristotle and Leibniz. \n\nSpatio-temporal relations are often exempted from this prescription\nsince the idea that the position of an object is intrinsic to it is\nassociated with a very strong form of substantivalism. Hence, the\nstandard view is that the relations between individuals other than\ntheir spatio-temporal relations supervene on the intrinsic properties\nof the relata and their spatio-temporal relations. This is David\nLewis's Humean supervenience: \n\nTim Maudlin argues against Lewis's Humean Supervenience on the\nbasis of quantum entanglement and argues that this means the end of\nontological reductionism, and abandoning the combinatorial conception\nof reality that comes from thinking of the world as made of building\nblocks, each of which exists independently of the others (1998, 59)\nand: “The world is not just a set of separately existing\nlocalized objects, externally related only by space and time”\n(60). Similarly, advocates of OSR such as Esfeld, French and Ladyman\nemphasise that the non-supervenient relations implied by quantum\nentanglement undermine the ontological priority conferred on\nindividuals in most traditional metaphysics. Some relations are at\nleast ontologically on a par with individuals so that either relations\nare ontologically primary or neither is ontologically primary or\nsecondary. (Esfeld 2004 and Oliver Pooley 2006 hold the latter view but\nEsfeld goes further and claims that if there are intrinsic properties\nthey are ontologically secondary and derivative of relational\nproperties (see below).) \n\n(3) Individual objects have no intrinsic natures. \n\nOn this view, individual objects of a particular kind are\nqualitatively identical. They are not individuated by an haecceity or\nprimitive thisness. Classical particles can be and often are so\nregarded. Classical particles could be so regarded because if a\nprinciple of impenetrability is adhered to, no two such particles ever\nhave all the same spatio-temporal properties. The bundle theory of\nindividuation was developed by empiricists to account for the\nindividuation of physical objects while only quantifying over\nproperties that are within the reach of natural science. This is a\nstandard metaphysical position that implies nothing so radical as any\nversion of OSR. Its interest lies in the fact that on this view it\nwould seem that the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles (PII),\nrestricted so that identity involving properties are not in its scope,\nmust be true. If so there are some properties (perhaps including\nspatio-temporal properties) that distinguish each thing from every\nother thing, and the identity and individuality of physical objects can\nbe reduced to other facts about them. \n\nThe problem is with Quantum Mechanics for it seems there are\nentangled quantum states of many particles that attribute exactly the\nsame intrinsic and relational properties to each of them. For example,\nthe famous singlet state of two fermions, such as electrons, attributes\nto the pair the relation that their spins in any given direction are\nopposite to each other, but does not attribute a definite spin in any\ndirection to either particle alone. Given that they may also be\nattributed exactly the same spatial wavefunction, as when they are both\nin the first orbit of an atom, for example, then such particles would\nseem to violate PII. This leads to a dilemma that was articulated by\nSteven French and Michael Redhead (1988); either quantum particles are\nnot individuals, or they are individuals but the principle of\nindividuation that applies to them must make reference to some kind of\nempirically transcendent haecceity, bare particularity or the like. \n\nKatherine Brading and Alexander Skyles (2012) consider the\nplausibility of arguing for structural realism on the basis of this\nunderdetermination. Saunders argues that there is no\nunderdetermination (see (5) below).  The appeal to this metaphysical\nunderdetermination is criticised by Chakravartty 2003, who argues that\nit cannot be significant since it also obtains in the case of everyday\nobjects. Morganti (2004) argues in favour of transcendental\nindividuation, and also points out that if quantum mechanics is not\ncomplete and there are hidden variables as in Bohm theory, the quantum\nparticles may be individuated by their intrinsic and spatio-temporal\nproperties after all. \n\n(4) There are individual entities but they don't have any\nirreducible intrinsic properties. \n\nMichael Esfeld (2004) rejects (1) and claims that: \n\nbut denies that: \n\nAs mentioned above Esfeld holds that there are things and relations\nbut neither is ontologically primary or secondary. On this view, all\nthe properties of individual objects are relations to other objects.\nThis view is called ‘moderate structural realism’ by\nEsfeld (and Esfeld and Lam 2008, 2010 and see also their 2012). It\navoids the problems with (1) above, and incorporates (2) and (3). Any\nversion of (4) that is combined with (3) arguably makes individual\nentities ontologically dependent on relational structure (see (6)\nbelow). \n\nBenacerraf (1965) argues that there cannot be objects possessing\nonly structural properties. The idea of such objects is denounced as\n‘mysticism’ by Dummett (1991), and criticised in the\ncontext of structural realism by Busch (2003). These objections go back\nto Russell: \n\nOn the other hand, D.W. Mertz (1996) defends ‘network instance\nrealism’ and rejects the ‘tyranny of the monadic’\narguing that individuated relation instances are ontologically\nfundamental. \n\n(5) Facts about the identity and diversity of objects are\nontologically dependent on the relational structures of which they are\npart. \n\nSaunders (2003a, 2003b and 2006) argues that there is a weakened form\nof PII (discussed by Quine 1976) that is satisfied even by electrons\nin the singlet state described above. The notion of ‘weak\ndiscernibility’ applies to objects that satisfy some irreflexive\nrelation (a relation such that xRx does not\nobtain for every x). The relation of having opposite spin\nthat is had by electrons in the singlet state is clearly such an\nirreflexive relation and Saunders argues that, since by Leibniz's law,\nthe holding of an irreflexive relation aRb\nentails the existence of distinct relata a and\nb, then the electrons are individuals, even though in so far as they\nare individuals it is the relations among them that account for\nthis. \n\nThis runs counter to the usual way of thinking according to which\nthere are individuals in spacetime whose existence is independent of\neach other and that facts about the identity and diversity of these\nindividuals are determined independently of their relations to each\nother (Stachel 2006 calls this ‘intrinsic individuality’).\nIt is widely held that relations between individuals cannot individuate\nthose same individuals: “relations presuppose numerical diversity\nand so cannot account for it”. The argument is that without\ndistinct individuals that are metaphysically prior to the relations,\nthere is nothing to stand in the irreflexive relations that are\nsupposed to confer individuality on the relata. The issue was famously\ndiscussed by Russell (1911), and see also MacBride (2006). Ladyman and\nRoss (2007), Saunders (2006) and Stachel (2006) argue that facts about\nthe identity and diversity of fermions are not intrinsic obtain only in\nvirtue of the relations into which they enter. On this view the\nindividuality of quantum particles is ontologically on a par with, or\nsecondary to the relational structure of which they are parts. Stachel\n(2006) calls this ‘contextual individuality’ and he extends\nthis to spacetime points (see 4.3 below). \n\nLeitgeb and Ladyman (2008) note that in the case of mathematical\nstructures there is nothing to rule out the possibility that the\nidentity and diversity of objects in a structure is a primitive\nfeature of the structure as a whole that is not accounted for by any\nother facts about it. Ladyman (2007) also discusses such primitive\ncontextual individuality. One important question so far not discussed\nis whether on the contextualist view the identity and diversity of the\nobjects depends on the whole structure or just part of it. The\nrelationship between OSR and PII is assessed in Ainsworth\n(2011). Ladyman, Linnebo, and Richard Pettigrew (2013) present some\nrelevant results in philosophical logic. \n\n(6) There are no subsistent objects and relational structure is\nontologically subsistent. \n\nThis claim is associated with quantum holism and holism more generally\n(see Horgan and Potrc 2000 and 2002). As mentioned above this is\narguably implied by the conjunction of (3) and (4), and also by (5).\nThe basic idea of ontological subsistence is that of being able to\nexist without anything else existing. The notions of ontological\ndependence and ontological subsistence are often employed in\ndiscussions of structuralism but are in need of clarification (see\nLinnebo 2008). Kerry McKenzie (forthcoming) uses Fine's recent analyses of\nontological dependence to argue against eliminativist OSR and in\nfavour of moderate structural realism based on a case study from\nparticle physics. \n\n(7) Individual objects are constructs \n\nFrench (1999) and French and Ladyman (2003a) maintain that\nindividuals have only a heuristic role. Poincaré similarly argued\nthat “the gross matter which is furnished us by our sensations\nwas but a crutch for our infirmity” (1898, 41). Ladyman and Ross\n(2007) argue that objects are pragmatic devices used by agents to\norient themselves in regions of spacetime, and to construct approximate\nrepresentations of the world. Anyone who defends eliminativism as in\n(1) above must similarly offer a non-ad hoc account of the point and\nvalue of reference to and generalization over objects in science. For\nexample, cognitive science may show that we are not able to think about\ncertain domains without hypostatising individuals as the bearers of\nstructure. This is as yet mere speculation and a subject for further\nstudy. \n\nThe articles in Landry and Rickles (eds.) (2012) explore some of the\nabove issues. See McKenzie's (2013) review of the collection. See\nalso the collection Bokulich and Bokulich (eds.) (2011). Joanna Wolff\n(2012) considers the relationship between objects and structures,\narguing that the former are not reducible to the latter and suggesting\nthat a form of ontic structural realism may be defended in terms of\nthe claim that objects are ontologically dependent on structures. \n\nGroup theory was first developed to describe symmetry. A symmetry is\na transformation of some structure or object which leaves it unchanged\nin some respect. A group of symmetry transformations is a mathematical\nobject which consists of the set of transformations, including the\nidentity transformation and the inverse of each transformation, and the\noperation of composing them, where the result of two composed\ntransformations is itself in the original set. Mathematical objects can\nbe characterised in terms of which symmetry transformations leave them\nunchanged or invariant. \n\nThe founders of structuralism shared an appreciation of the\nimportance of group theory in the ontology of physics. Cassirer held\nthat the possibility of talking of ‘objects’ in a context\nis the possibility of individuating invariants (1944). Similarly, Max\nBorn says: “Invariants are the concepts of which science speaks\nin the same way as ordinary language speaks of ‘things’,\nand which it provides with names as if they were ordinary things”\n(1953, 149), and: “The feature which suggests reality is always\nsome kind of invariance of a structure independent of the aspect, the\nprojection” (149). He goes so far as to say: “I think the\nidea of invariant is the clue to a relational concept of reality, not\nonly in physics but in every aspect of the world.” (144).\nEddington says: “What sort of thing is it that I know? The answer\nis structure. To be quite precise it is structure of the kind\ndefined and investigated in the mathematical theory of groups”\n(1939, 147). Poincaré understands group structure in Kantian\nterms as a pure form of the understanding. \n\nThe idea then is that we have various representations of some\nphysical structure which may be transformed or translated into one\nanother, and then we have an invariant state under such transformations\nwhich represents the objective state of affairs. The group structure is\nprimary and the group representations constructed from this structure\nhave a derivative status. Representations are extraneous to physical\nstates but they allow our empirical knowledge of them. Objects are\npicked out by the identification of invariants with respect to the\ntransformations relevant to the context. Thus, on this view, elementary\nparticles are hypostatisations of sets of quantities that are invariant\nunder the symmetry groups of particle physics. \n\nFor example, one of the most fundamental distinctions between kinds\nof particles is that between fermions and bosons. This was described\ngroup theoretically by Weyl and Wigner in terms of the group of\npermutations, and the former's approach to relativity theory was\nsimilarly group-theoretic. In the case of quantum mechanics Weyl\nasserts that: “All quantum numbers, with the exception of the\nso-called principal quantum number, are indices characterising\nrepresentations of groups.” (1931, xxi) The central point of\nphilosophical relevance here is that the mathematical idea of\ninvariance is taken by Weyl to characterise the notion of objectivity.\nIt is this that liberates physics from the parochial confines of a\nparticular coordinate system. For Weyl appearances are open only to\nintuition (in the Kantian sense of subjective perception) and therefore\nagreement is obtained by giving objective status only to those\nrelations that are invariant under particular transformations. \n\nWeyl's views have recently been revived by Sunny Auyang (1995) in an\nexplicitly neo-Kantian project which attempts to solve the problem of\nobjectivity in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Auyang seeks\nto extract the “primitive conceptual structure” in physical\ntheories and she too finds it in what she calls the\n“representation-transformation-invariant structure”. This\nis essentially group-theoretic structure. Auyang, like Born and Weyl,\nthinks that such invariant structure under transformations is what\nseparates an objective state of affairs from its various\nrepresentations, or manifestations to observers under different\nperceptual conditions. According to her events are individuated\nstructurally. \n\nRyckman (2005) describes the history of relativity theory and Weyl's\nrole in it. Ryckman argues that the work of Eddington and Weyl was\nprofoundly influenced by the phenomenology of Husserl. The latter also\nseems to have understood objectivity in terms of invariance. (Ryckman\ncalls Kantian structural realism “transcendental\nstructuralism”. OSR is what he calls ‘transcendent\nstructuralism’.) Group theory in the development of\nstructuralism deserves further historical analysis. It played a\ncrucial role in epistemological reflections on geometry in relation to\nKlein's Erlanger programme (Birkhoff and Bennett 1988). French (1998,\n1999, 2000) and Castellani (1998) have explored the ontological\nrepresentation of the fundamental objects of physics in terms of sets\nof group-theoretic invariants by Cassirer, Eddington,\nSchrödinger, Weyl, Wigner, Piron, Jauch and others. On the other\nhand, Roberts (2011) criticizes the idea that structure can be\nunderstood as group structure in the context of quantum physics.  \n\nCassirer rejected the Aristotelian idea of individual substances on\nthe basis of physics, and argued that the metaphysical view of the\n‘material point’ as an individual object cannot be\nsustained in the context of field theory. He offers a structuralist\nconception of the field: \n\nIn gauge quantum field theories, which are our best contemporary\nphysical theories of all the forces other than gravity, each theory is\nassociated with a different symmetry group, and the unification of\ntheories was achieved by looking for theoretical structures with the\nrelevant combined symmetry. (For example, the unitary group U(1) for\nquantum electrodynamics, U(2) for the unified electroweak theory and\nSU(3)/ Z(3) for the strong interaction.) Lyre argues for OSR in the\ninterpretation of quantum field theory. He argues that “the\ntraditional picture of spatiotemporally fixed object-like entities is\nundermined by the ontology of gauge theories in various ways and that\nmain problems with traditional scientific realism…can be\nsoftened by a commitment to the structural content of gauge theories,\nin particular to gauge symmetry groups” (2004, 666). He goes on\nto note that his favoured interpretation of gauge theories (in terms\nof non-separable holonomies) is one according to which the fundamental\nobjects are ontologically secondary to structure because the objects\nof a theory are members of equivalence classes under symmetry\ntransformations and no further individuation of objects is\npossible. Similarly, Kantorovich (2003) argues that the symmetries of\nthe strong force are ontologically prior to the particles that feel\nthat force, namely the hadrons, and likewise for the symmetries of the\nso-called ‘grand unification’ of particle physics in the\nstandard model. Cao in his book on quantum field theory sometimes\nsounds like an ontic structural realist, because he denies that the\nstructures postulated by field theories must be “ontologically\nsupported by unobservable entities” (Cao 1997, 5). However, in\nhis (2003a) he explicitly criticises OSR and argues for a version of\nESR in the context of a discussion of quantum field theory. \n\nCritics of OSR may argue that the claim of metaphysical\nunderdetermination in the case of non-relativistic many particle\nquantum mechanics is resolved by the shift to quantum field theory.\nThis is especially plausible when it comes to quantum field theory in\na curved spacetime since in that context, “a useful particle\ninterpretation of states does not, in general, exist” (Wald\n1984, 47, quoted in Stachel 2006, 58). See also Malament (1996) and\nClifton and Halvorson (2002), who show that there is a fundamental\nconflict between relativistic quantum field theory and the existence\nof localisable particles. There are so called unitarily inequivalent\nrepresentations of quantum field theories and Howard (2001) argues\nthat this poses a problem for structural realism, and French (2012)\nreplies. \n\nField quantities are usually attributed to space-time points or\nregions. The problem of individuality now concerns whether fields\nthemselves are individuals, or whether they are the properties of\nspacetime points. In the latter case the problem becomes whether the\nspacetime points are individuals. This last question is bound up with\nthe debate about substantivalism in the foundations of General\nRelativity. \n\nThere has been much dispute about whether General Relativity\nsupports relationism or substantivalism about spacetime. The main\nproblem for the latter is the general covariance of the field equations\nof General Relativity: any spacetime model and its image under a\ndiffeomorphism (a infinitely differentiable, one-one and onto mapping\nof the model to itself) are in all observable respects equivalent to\none another; all physical properties are expressed in terms of\ngenerally covariant relationships between geometrical objects. In other\nwords, since the points of spacetime are entirely indiscernible one\nfrom another, it makes no difference if we swap their properties around\nso long as the overall structure remains the same. This is made more\napparent by the so-called ‘hole argument’ which shows that\nif diffeomorphic models are regarded as physically distinct then there\nis a breakdown of determinism. Substantivalists cannot just bite the\nbullet and accept this since, as John Earman and John Norton (1987)\nargue, the question of determinism ought to be settled on\nempirical/physical grounds and not a priori ones. \n\nThere have been a variety of responses to this problem. Lewis (1986)\nand Carol Brighouse (1994) suggest accepting haecceitism about\nspacetime points, but argue that it should not worry us that\nhaecceitistic determinism, that is determinism with respect to which\npoints end up with which metrical properties, fails. Melia (1999) also\ncriticises the notion of determinism employed by Earman and Norton.\nNonetheless most philosophers of physics seem to have concluded that if\nspacetime points do have primitive identity then the substantivalist\nwho is committed to them must regard the failure of haecceitistic\ndeterminism as a genuine failure of determinism. Hence, others have\nsought to modify the substantivalism. \n\nRobert DiSalle (1994) suggests that the correct response to the hole\nargument is that the structure of spacetime be accepted as existent\ndespite its failure to supervene on the reality of spacetime points. A\nsimilar view has been proposed by Carl Hoefer, who argues that the\nproblems for spacetime substantivalism turn on the “ascription of\nprimitive identity to space-time points” (1996, 11). Hence, it\nseems that the insistence on interpreting spacetime in terms of an\nontology of underlying entities and their properties is what causes the\nproblems for realism about spacetime. This is a restatement of the\nposition developed by Stein (1968) in his famous exchange with\nGrünbaum, according to which spacetime is neither a substance, not\na set of relations between substances, but a structure in its own\nright. Similarly, Oliver Pooley (2007) argues that eliminativism about\nindividual spacetime points can be avoided without any tension with\nGeneral Relativity, if it is accepted that the facts about their\nidentity and diversity is grounded in relations they bear to each\nother. His sophisticated substantivalism allows that spacetime points\nbe individuated relationally and not independently of the metric field.\nThis means embracing contextual individuality grounded in relational\nstructure. See also Cassirer who says: “To such a [spacetime]\npoint also no being in itself can be ascribed; it is constituted by a\ndefinite aggregate of relations and consists in this aggregate.”\n(1936, 195) \n\nThe analogy between the debate about substantivalism, and the debate\nabout whether quantum particles are individuals was first explicitly\nmade by Ladyman (1998), but others such as Stachel (2002) and Saunders\n(2003a and 2003b) have elaborated it. However, Pooley (2006) argues\nthat there is no such analogy, or at least not a very deep one, in part\nbecause he thinks that there is no metaphysical underdetermination in\nGR. According to him the standard formulations of the theory are\nontologically committed to the metric field, and the latter is most\nnaturally interpreted as representing “spacetime structure”\n(8). \n\nOthers who have discussed structural realism and spacetime include,\nDorato (2000) who discusses spacetime and structural realism but\nrejects OSR, Esfeld and Lam (2008 and 2012) who argue for moderate ontic\nstructural realism about spacetime, and Bain (2003), who says that:\n“Conformal structure, for instance, can be realised on many\ndifferent types of ‘individuals’: manifold points, twisters\nor multivectors …What is real, the spacetime structuralist will\nclaim, is the structure itself and not the manner in which alternative\nformalisms instantiate it” (25). \n\nAs explained above, there are many different forms of structural\nrealism and correspondingly, many different objections have been\nleveled against it. Obviously, ESR and OSR attract very different\nkinds of objections. Different forms of structural realism and\ndifferent forms of objections to it are also reviewed in Frigg and\nVotsis (2011).\n\n(1) Structural realism collapses into standard realism. \n\nPsillos (1995) argues that any form of structural realism must\npresuppose a distinction between the form and content of a theory,\nand/or a distinction between our ability to know the structure and our\nability to know the nature of the world. Both these distinctions are\nillusory according to Psillos because the scientific revolution\nbanished mysterious forms and substances that might not be fully\ndescribable in structural terms. For Psillos, properties in mature\nscience are defined by the laws in which they feature, and “the\nnature and the structure of a physical entity form a continuum”\n(1995). Hence, for Psillos, structural realism is either false or\ncollapses into traditional realism. (This is the response of\nRichard Braithwaite (1940, 463) to Eddington's structuralism.)\nSimilarly, David Papineau argues that “restriction of belief to\nstructural claims is in fact no restriction at all” (Papineau\n1996, 12), hence structural realism gains no advantage over traditional\nrealism with the problem of theory change because it fails to make any\ndistinction between parts of theories that should and should not enjoy\nour ontological commitment. Kyle Stanford (2003, 570) also argues that\nwe cannot distinguish the structural claims of theories from their\nclaims about content or natures. \n\n(2) Isn't structure also lost in theory change? \n\nMany people's first response to structural realism is to point out\nthat mathematical structure is often lost in theory change too (see,\nfor example, Chakravartty 2004, 164, Stanford 2003,\n570–572). The realist is claiming that we ought to believe what\nour best scientific theories say about the furniture of the world in\nthe face of the fact that we have inductive grounds for believing this\nwill be radically revised, whereas the structural realist is only\nclaiming that theories represent the relations among, or structure of,\nthe phenomena and in most scientific revolutions the empirical content\nof the old theory is recovered as a limiting case of the new\ntheory. As Post claimed, there simply are no\n‘Kuhn-losses’, in the sense of successor theories losing\nall or part of the well confirmed empirical structures of their\npredecessors (1971, 229). In sum, we know that well-confirmed\nrelations among phenomena must be retained by future theories. This\ngoes beyond mere belief in the empirical adequacy of our theories if\nwe suppose that the relations in question are genuine modal relations\nrather than extensional generalizations about concrete actual\nphenomena. However, Newman (2010) argues that structuralism cannot\ndeal with the pessimistic meta-induction. \n\n(3) Structural realism is too metaphysically revisionary. \n\nThe considerations from physics do not logically compel us to\nabandon the idea of a world of distinct ontologically subsistent\nindividuals with intrinsic properties. The identity and individuality\nof quantum particles could be grounded in each having a primitive\nthisness, and the same could be true of spacetime points. Physics does\nseem to tell us that certain aspects of such a world would be\nunknowable. The epistemic structural realist thinks that all we can\nknow is structure, but it is the structure of an unknowable realm of\nindividuals. An epistemic structural realist may insist in a Kantian\nspirit that there being such objects is a necessary condition for our\nempirical knowledge of the world. It may be argued that it is\nimpossible to conceive of relational structures without making models\nof them in terms of domains of individuals. Certainly, the\nstructuralist faces a challenge in articulating her views to\ncontemporary philosophers schooled in modern logic and set theory,\nwhich retains the classical framework of individual objects, and where\na structure is just a particular set, namely a set of objects, and a\nset of relations, where the latter are thought of extensionally as just\nsets of ordered pairs (or more generally n-tuples in the case of\nn-place relations). \n\nPsillos (2001) argues that OSR is not ‘worked out’ as a\nmetaphysics, and that a strong burden of proof is on those who would\nabandon traditional metaphysics (see also Chakravartty (2004) and\nMorganti (2011). However, it is far from clear that OSR's rivals are\n‘worked out’ in any sense that OSR isn't. There in no\ngeneral agreement among philosophers that any of the metaphysical\ntheories of, say, universals is adequate, and arguably metaphysical\ncategories inherited from the ancient Greeks are not appropriate for\ncontemporary science. Naturalists argue that we should reject\nmetaphysical doctrines if they are not supported by science. Michael\nEsfeld (2004, 614–616) argues against any gap between\nepistemology and metaphysics. Similarly Ladyman and Ross (2007) argue\nfor a kind of verificationism in metaphysics. \n\nIn sum, structuralists may agree with what Ernan McMullin says: \n\n(4) Structuralists can't account for causation.  \n\nBusch (2003), Psillos (2006a) and Chakravartty (2003) all argue that\nindividual objects are central to productive rather than Humean\nconceptions of causation and hence to any genuine explanation of\nchange. Objects it is alleged provide the ‘active\nprinciple’ of change and causation. French (2006) replies to\nthis charge invoking the idea of Ladyman (1998 and 2004) and French\nand Ladyman (2003) of modal structure, by which is meant the\nrelationships among phenomena that pertain to necessity, possibility,\npotentiality, and probability. Ladyman and Ross (2007) defend a\nversion of OSR according to which science describes the objective\nmodal structure of the world, where the latter is ontologically\nfundamental, in the sense of not supervening on the intrinsic\nproperties of a set of individuals.  They argue that causal structure\nis the pragmatically essential proxy for it in the special sciences\n(but not necessarily in fundamental physics). (Ladyman (2008)\nconsiders the causal exclusion argument in this context.) Nora\nBerenstain and Ladyman (2012) argue that a commitment to natural\nnecessity is implicit in arguments for scientific realism and that\nrealists including structural realists should be anti-Humean and\nbelieve in objective modal structure. See also Esfeld (2009) and for a\nHumean take on structural realism, Lyre (2010). The structure of\ndispositions described by Mumford (2004) and Psillos's (2003) idea of\nnomological structure are cognate to the idea of modal\nstructure. Giere (1985) first suggested that a form of structural\nrealism was the result of conjoining modal realism with constructive\nempiricism. There is a forthcoming special issue of Synthese\ndedicated to examining the relationship between structuralism and\ncausation. See also the 'final section' of articles on single modality\nand causality in structural realism in Landry and Rickles (2012). \n\n(5) Without positing knowledge of individual objects we cannot\nexplain why certain properties and relations tend to cohere. \n\nThis objection is due to Chakravartty (2003) who points out that\ncertain properties tend to be found together, for example, negative\ncharge and a certain rest mass, and then asks ‘coincidence or\nobject?’. French (2006) replies arguing that for a structuralist\nobjects just are literally coincidences and nothing more. Once again\nthe challenge for the critic of structuralism is to show that more than\nthe minimal logical notion of an object is required. \n\n(6) Structural realism only applies to physics. \n\nGower (2000) argues that structural realism seems less natural a\nposition when applied to theories from outside of physics. Mark Newman\n(2005) argues that structural realism only applies to the mathematical\nsciences in therefore cannot account for retention of theoretical\ncommitments across theory change in, for example, biology. On the\nother hand, Harold Kincaid (2008) and Ross (2008) defend structural\nrealist approaches to the social sciences, as do Ladyman and Ross\n(2007). French (2011) considers the implications of ontic structural\nrealism for the ontology of biology. \n\n(7) Structural Realism collapses the distinction between the\nmathematical and the physical. \n\nMany structuralists are motivated by the thought that if mathematics\ndescribes its domain only up to isomorphism, if in other words, it only\ndescribes the structure of the domain, once the scientific description\nof the world becomes largely mathematical, then scientific knowledge\ntoo becomes structural knowledge. However, it may then be argued that\nif only the structure of mathematical theories is relevant to ontology\nin mathematics, and only structural aspects of the mathematical\nformalism of physical theories are relevant to ontology in physics,\nthen there is nothing to distinguish physical and mathematical\nstructure. Van Fraassen argues that the heart of the problem with OSR\nis this: \n\nThe essence of van Fraassen's objection here is that the difference\nbetween mathematical (uninstantiated/abstract) structure, and physical\n(instantiated/concrete) structure cannot itself be explained in purely\nstructural terms. There is an analogy here with the theory of\nuniversals and the problem of exemplification. A similar complaint is\nmade by Cao (2003a and 2003b). Esfeld (2013) uses this objection in\nthe context of the interpretation of quantum mechanics to pose a\ndilemma for ontic structural realism. \n\nSaunders (2003d) points out that there is no reason to think that\nontic structural realists are committed to the idea that the structure\nof the world is mathematical.  Ladyman and Ross (2007) argue that no\naccount can be given of what makes the world-structure physical and\nnot mathematical. On the other hand, Tegmark (2007) explicitly\nembraces a Pythagorean form of OSR. \n\nThere are two versions of mathematical structuralism: a realist view\naccording to which mathematical structures exist independently of their\nconcrete instantiations; and an eliminativist position according to\nwhich statements about mathematical structures are disguised\ngeneralisations about their instantiations that exemplify them (see\nShapiro 1997, 149–50.) For an excellent survey see Reck and Price\n(2000). The most well known advocates of realist structuralism in the\nphilosophy of mathematics are Parsons (1990), Resnik (1997) and Shapiro\n(1997). Recent critiques include Hellman (2005) and MacBride (2005).\nThe relationship between ontic structural realism and ante rem\nstructuralism has been explored by Psillos (2006a), Busch (2003), French\n(2006), Pooley (2006a), Leitgeb and Ladyman (2008), Ladyman\n(2007) \n\nInformational structural realism in the context of the foundations of\ncomputer science is defended by Floridi (2008). Structuralism has also\nbecome popular in metaphysics recently in the form of causal\nessentialism. This is the doctrine that the causal relations that\nproperties bear to other properties exhaust their natures. See\nShoemaker (1980) and Hawthorne (2001). Steven Mumford (2004) adopts a\nstructuralist theory of properties. Alexander Bird's (2007) theory of\ndispositions is in some ways structuralist. Anjan Chakravartty's\n(2007) deploys dispositional essentialism in the defence of scientific\nrealism. Michael Esfeld (2011) discusses structuralism about\npowers. Finally, Verity Harte (2002) discusses an interesting Platonic\nform of structuralism. Alistair Isaac (forthcoming) argues for\nstructural realism for secondary qualities.","contact.mail":"James.Ladyman@bristol.ac.uk","contact.domain":"bristol.ac.uk"}]
