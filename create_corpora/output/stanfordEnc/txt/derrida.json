Indeed, Derrida’s fame nearly reached\nthe status of a media star, with hundreds of people filling\nauditoriums to hear him speak, with films and televisions programs\ndevoted to him, with countless books and articles devoted to his\nthinking. Beside critique, Derridean deconstruction consists in an\nattempt to re-conceive the difference that divides self-consciousnes\n(the difference of the “of” in consciousness of oneself). But even\nmore than the re-conception of difference, and perhaps more\nimportantly, deconstruction attempts to render justice. Indeed,\ndeconstruction is relentless in this pursuit since justice is\nimpossible to achieve.\n\n\n\nDerrida was born on July 15, 1930 in El-Biar (a suburb of Algiers),\nAlgeria (then a part of France), into a Sephardic Jewish\nfamily. Because Derrida’s writing concerns auto-bio-graphy\n(writing about one’s life as a form of relation to oneself),\nmany of his writings are auto-biographical. So, for instance in\nMonolingualism of the Other (1998), Derrida recounts how,\nwhen he was in the “lycée” (high school), the Vichy\nregime in France proclaimed certain interdictions concerning the\nnative languages of Algeria, in particular Berber.  Derrida calls his\nexperience of the “interdiction” “unforgettable and\ngeneralizable” (1998, p. 37). In fact, the “Jewish\nlaws” passed by the Vichy regime interrupted his high school\nstudies. \n\nImmediately after World War II, Derrida started to study philosophy.\nIn 1949, he moved to Paris, where he prepared for the entrance exam in\nphilosophy for the prestigious École Normale Supérieure.\nDerrida failed his first attempt at this exam, but passed it in his\nsecond try in 1952. In one of the many eulogies that he wrote for\nmembers of his generation, Derrida recounts that, as he went into the\ncourtyard toward the building in which he would sit for the second\ntry, Gilles Deleuze passed him, smiling and saying, “My thoughts\nare with you, my very best thoughts.” Indeed, Derrida entered\nthe École Normale at a time when a remarkable generation of\nphilosophers and thinkers was coming of age. We have already mentioned\nDeleuze, but there was also Foucault, Althusser, Lyotard, Barthes, and\nMarin. Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Levi-Strauss, Lacan,\nRicœur, Blanchot, and Levinas were still alive. The Fifties in\nFrance was the time of phenomenology, and Derrida studied closely\nHusserl’s then published works as well as some of the archival\nmaterial that was then available. The result was a Masters thesis from\nthe academic year 1953–54 called The Problem of Genesis in\nHusserl’s Philosophy; Derrida published this text in\n1990. Most importantly, at the École Normale, Derrida studied\nHegel with Jean Hyppolite.  Hyppolite (along with Maurice de\nGandillac) was to direct Derrida’s doctoral thesis, “The\nIdeality of the Literary Object”; Derrida never completed this\nthesis. His studies with Hyppolite however led Derrida to a noticeably\nHegelian reading of Husserl, one already underway through the works of\nHusserl’s assistant, Eugen Fink. Derrida claimed in his 1980\nspeech “The Time of a Thesis” (presented on the occasion\nof him finally receiving his doctorate) that he never studied\nMerleau-Ponty and Sartre and that especially he never subscribed to\ntheir readings of Husserl and phenomenology in general. With so much\nMerleau-Ponty archival material available, it is possible now however\nto see similarities between Merleau-Ponty’s final studies of\nHusserl and Derrida’s first studies. Nevertheless, even if one\nknows Merleau-Ponty’s thought well, one is taken aback by\nDerrida’s one hundred and fifty page long Introduction to his\nFrench translation of Husserl’s “The Origin of\nGeometry” (1962). Derrida’s Introduction looks to be a\nradically new understanding of Husserl insofar as Derrida stresses the\nproblem of language in Husserl’s thought of history. \n\nThe 1960s is a decade of great achievement for this generation of\nFrench thinkers. 1961 sees the publication of Foucault’s\nmonumental History of Madness (Madness and\nCivilization). At this time, Derrida is participating in a seminar\ntaught by Foucault; on the basis of it, he will write “Cogito\nand the History of Madness” (1963), in which he criticizes\nFoucault’s early thought, especially Foucault’s\ninterpretation of Descartes.  “Cogito and the History of\nMadness” will result in a rupture between Derrida and Foucault,\nwhich will never fully heal. In the early 60s, Derrida reads Heidegger\nand Levinas carefully. The recently published lecture course from\n1964–1965, Heidegger: The Question of Being and\nHistory, allows us to see how Derrida developed his questions to\nHeidegger. In 1964, Derrida publishes a long two part essay on\nLevinas, “Violence and Metaphysics.” It is hard to\ndetermine which of Derrida’s early essays is the most important,\nbut certainly “Violence and Metaphysics” has to be a\nleading candidate. \nWhat comes through clearly in “Violence and Metaphysics”\nis Derrida’s great sympathy for Levinas’s thought of\nalterity, and at the same it is clear that Derrida is taking some\ndistance from Levinas’s thought. Despite this distance,\n“Violence and Metaphysics” will open up a lifetime\nfriendship with Levinas. In 1967 (at the age of thirty-seven), Derrida\nhas his “annus mirabilis,” publishing three books at\nonce: Writing and Difference,\nVoice and Phenomenon, and Of Grammatology. In all\nthree, Derrida uses the word “deconstruction” (to which we\nshall return below) in passing to describe his project. The word\ncatches on immediately and comes to define Derrida’s\nthought. From then on up to the present, the word is bandied about,\nespecially in the Anglophone world.  It comes to be associated with a\nform of writing and thinking that is illogical and imprecise. It must\nbe noted that Derrida’s style of writing contributed not only to\nhis great popularity but also to the great animosity some felt towards\nhim. His style is frequently more literary than philosophical and\ntherefore more evocative than argumentative. \nCertainly, Derrida’s style is not traditional. In the same\nspeech from 1980 at the time of him being awarded a doctorate, Derrida\ntells us that, in the Seventies, he devoted himself to developing a\nstyle of writing. The most clearest example is his 1974 Glas\n(“Death Knell” would be an approximate English\ntranslation; the current English translation simply uses the word\n“glas”); here Derrida writes in two columns, with the left devoted to\na reading of Hegel and the right devoted to a reading of the French\nnovelist-playwright Jean Genet. Another example would be his 1980\nPostcard from Socrates to Freud and Beyond; the opening two\nhundred pages of this book consist of love letters addressed to no one\nin particular. It seems that sometime around this time (1980), Derrida\nreverted back to the more linear and somewhat argumentative style, the\nvery style that defined his texts from the Sixties. He never however\nrenounced a kind of evocation, a calling forth that truly defines\ndeconstruction. Derrida takes the idea of a call from\nHeidegger. Starting in 1968 with “The Ends of Man,”\nDerrida devoted a number of texts to Heidegger’s thought. But,\nit is really with the 1978 publication of The Truth in\nPainting, and then throughout the 1980s, that Derrida intensified\nhis reading of Heidegger. In particular, he wrote a series of essays\non the question of sex or race in Heidegger (“Geschlecht\nI-IV”). While frequently critical, these essays often provide\nnew insights into Heidegger’s thought. The culminating essay in\nDerrida’s series on Heidegger is his 1992 Aporias. \nWhile Derrida's intensive work on Husserl and phenomenology was\nprimarily limited to the late 1960s, and to the publication of\nVoice and Phenomenon in 1967, this one book produced many\ncriticisms of his reading of Husserl. Most notable is J. Claude Evans'\nStrategies of Deconstruction: Derrida and the Myth of the\nVoice in 1991 (for other criticisms, see Bernet 1988, Brough\n1993, Mohanty 1997, and Zahavi 1999). Although throughout his career\nDerrida would mention Husserl in passing, he surprisingly wrote a\nchapter on Husserl in his Touching: Jean-Luc Nancy. One of\nthe places where he mentions Husserl is his 1971 address to a\ncommunication conference in Montreal, “Signature Event\nContext.” He publishes this article as the final chapter of\nMargins of Philosophy in 1972. While “Signature Event\nContext” contains a short discussion of Husserl, its real focus\nis Austin's speech act theory. The connection Derrida makes between\nHusserl's phenomenology and Austin's speech act theory is that both\nreject citations from the realm of meaningfulness (Husserl) or of the\nperformative (Austin). (Speech theory had a substantial influence on\nFrench philosophy at this moment, and Derrida would continue to refer\nto the constative/performative distinction throughout his career.) In\nany case, the English translation of “Signature Event\nContext” appeared in the first volume of the new journal\nGlyph in 1977. The editor of Glyph, Sam Weber,\ninvited John Searle to write a response to “Signature Event\nHistory.” In his response, “Reiterating the Differences: A\nReply to Derrida,” Searle points out a number of flaws in\nDerrida's argumentation and his understanding of Austin. For the\nsecond volume of Glyph (also published in 1977), Derrida\ncontributed a response to Searle's “Reply” called\n“Limited Inc a b c.” In contrast to Searle's ten page\n“Reply,” Derrida's “Limited Inc” ran to ninety\npages. Derrida's “Limited Inc” is an almost merciless\ncriticism of Searle, whom he calls “Sarl.” For instance,\nhe points out that Searle in his “Reply” hardly mentions\nsignature, event, or context. “Limited Inc” indicates\nDerrida's growing frustration with the reception of his work,\nespecially in the Anglophone world. His frustration must have\nculminated when he was offered an honorary degree at Cambridge\nUniversity in 1992. A group of analytic philosophers wrote an open\nletter (available online) to the Times of London,\nin which they objected to Derrida receiving this honorary\ndegree. Despite the letter, Cambridge University awarded Derrida the\ndegree. \n\nThroughout the Sixties, having been invited by Hyppolite and\nAlthusser, Derrida taught at the École Normale. In 1983, he\nbecame “Director of Studies” in “Philosophical\nInstitutions” at the École des Hautes Études en\nSciences Sociales in Paris; he will hold this position until his\ndeath.  Starting in the Seventies, Derrida held many appointments in\nAmerican universities, in particular Johns Hopkins University and Yale\nUniversity. From 1987, Derrida taught one semester a year at the\nUniversity of California at Irvine.  Derrida’s close\nrelationship with Irvine led to the establishment of the Derrida\narchives there. Also during the Seventies, Derrida associated himself\nwith GREPH (“Le Groupe de Recherche sur l’Enseignement\nPhilosophique,” in English: “The Group Investigating the\nTeaching of Philosophy”). As its name suggests, this group\ninvestigated how philosophy is taught in the high schools and\nuniversities in France. Derrida wrote several texts based on this\nresearch, many of which were collected in Du droit à la\nphilosophie (1990, one part of this book has been translated into\nEnglish as Eyes of the University. Right to Philosophy 2). In\n1982, Derrida was also one of the founders of the Collège\nInternationale de Philosophie in Paris, and served as its first\ndirector from 1982 to 1984. \n\nIn the 1990s, Derrida’s works went in two simultaneous\ndirections that tend to intersect and overlap with one another:\npolitics and religion. These two directions were probably first\nclearly evident in Derrida’s 1989 “Force of Law.”\nBut one can see them better in his 1993 Specters of Marx,\nwhere Derrida insisted that a deconstructed (or criticized) Marxist\nthought is still relevant to today’s world despite globalization\nand that a deconstructed Marxism consists in a new messianism, a\nmessianism of a “democracy to come.” But, even though\nDerrida was approaching the end of his life, he produced many\ninteresting texts in the Nineties and into the new century. For\ninstance, Derrida’s 1996 text on Levinas, “A Word of\nWelcome,” lays out the most penetrating logic of the same and\nother through a discussion of hospitality. In his final works on\nsovereignty, in particular, Rogues (2003), Derrida shows that\nthe law always contains the possibility of suspension, which means\nthat even the most democratic of nations (the United States for\nexample) resembles a “rogue state” or perhaps is the most\n“roguish” of all states. Based on lectures first presented\nduring the summer of 1998,The Animal that Therefore I am)\nappeared as the first posthumous work in 2006; concerning animality,\nit indicates Derrida’s continuous interest in the question of\nlife. We see this interest in life also in Derrida's lectures on the\ndeath penalty, where he questions the meaning of cruelty (which is\nmore cruel, the death penalty or life in prison?). Animal life and\npower is the theme of Derrida’s last lecture courses on\n“The Beast and the Sovereign.” (For a study of this final\ncourse, see Krell 2013.) \n\nSometime in 2002, Derrida was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He\ndied on October 8, 2004. Since his death two biographies have appeared\n(Powell 2006 and Peeters 2013). \n\nAs we noted, Derrida became famous at the end of the 1960s,\nwith the publication of three books in 1967. At this time, other great\nbooks appear: Foucault’s Les mots et les choses (The\nOrder of Things is the English language title) in 1966;\nDeleuze’s Difference and Repetition in 1968. It is hard\nto deny that the philosophy publications of this epoch indicate that we\nhave before us a kind of philosophical moment (a moment perhaps\ncomparable to the moment of German Idealism at the beginning of the\n19th century). Hélène Cixous calls this\ngeneration of French philosophers “the incorruptibles.” In\nthe last interview Derrida gave (to Le Monde on August 19,\n2004), he provided an interpretation of “the\nincorruptibles”: “By means of metonymy, I call this\napproach [of ‘the incorruptibles’] an intransigent, even\nincorruptible, ethos of writing and thinking …, without\nconcession even to philosophy, and not letting public opinion, the\nmedia, or the phantasm of an intimidating readership frighten or force\nus into simplifying or repressing. Hence the strict taste for\nrefinement, paradox, and aporia.” Derrida proclaims that today,\nmore than ever, “this predilection [for paradox and aporia]\nremains a requirement.” How are we to understand this\nrequirement, this predilection for “refinement, paradox, and\naporia”? \n\nIn an essay from 1998, “Typewriter Ribbon,” Derrida\ninvestigates the relation of confession to archives. But, before he\nstarts the investigation (which will concern primarily Rousseau), he\nsays, “Let us put in place the premises of our question.”\nHe says, “Will this be possible for us? Will we one day be able\nto, and in a single gesture, to join the thinking of the event to the\nthinking of the machine? Will we be able to think, what is called\nthinking, at one and the same time, both what is happening (we call\nthat an event) and the calculable programming of an automatic\nrepetition (we call that a machine). For that, it would be necessary\nin the future (but there will be no future except on this condition)\nto think both the event and the machine as two compatible or even\nin-dissociable concepts. Today they appear to us to be\nantinomic” (Without Alibi, p. 72). These two concepts\nappear to us to be antinomic because we conceive an event as something\nsingular and non-repeatable. Moreover, Derrida associates this\nsingularity to the living. The living being undergoes a sensation and\nthis sensation (an affect or feeling for example) gets inscribed in\norganic material. The idea of an inscription leads Derrida to the\nother pole. The machine that inscribes is based in repetition;\n“It is destined, that is, to reproduce impassively,\nimperceptibly, without organ or organicity, the received commands. In\na state of anaesthesis, it would obey or command a calculable program\nwithout affect or auto-affection, like an indifferent automaton”\n(Without Alibi, p. 73). The automatic nature of the inorganic\nmachine is not the spontaneity attributed to organic life. It is easy\nto see the incompatibility of the two concepts: organic, living\nsingularity (the event) and inorganic, dead universality (mechanical\nrepetition). Derrida says that, if we can make these two concepts\ncompatible, “you can bet not only (and I insist on not only)\nwill one have produced a new logic, an unheard of conceptual form. In\ntruth, against the background and at the horizon of our present\npossibilities, this new figure would resemble a monster.” The\nmonstrosity of this paradox between event and repetition announces,\nperhaps, another kind of thinking, an impossible thinking: the\nimpossible event (there must be resemblance to the past which cancels\nthe singularity of the event) and the only possible event (since any\nevent in order to be event worthy of its name must be singular and\nnon-resembling). Derrida concludes this discussion by saying:\n“To give up neither the event nor the machine, to subordinate\nneither one to the other, neither to reduce one to the other: this is\nperhaps a concern of thinking that has kept a certain number of\n‘us’ working for the last few decades” (Without\nAlibi, p. 74). This “us” refers to Derrida’s\ngeneration of thinkers: “the incorruptibles.” What Derrida\nsays here defines a general project which consists in trying to\nconceive the relation between machine-like repeatability and\nirreplaceable singularity neither as a relation of externality\n(external as in Descartes’s two substance or as in Platonism’s two\nworlds) nor as a relation of homogeneity (any form of reductionism\nwould suffice here to elucidate a homogeneous relation). Instead, the\nrelation is one in which the elements are internal to one another and\nyet remain heterogeneous. Derrida’s famous term\n“différance” (to which we shall return below)\nrefers to this relation in which machine-like repeatability is\ninternal to irreplaceable singularity and yet the two remain\nheterogeneous to one another. \n\nOf course, Cixous intends with the word “incorruptibles”\nthat the generation of French philosophers who came of age in the\nSixties, what they wrote and did, will never decay, will remain\nendlessly new and interesting. This generation will remain pure. But,\nthe term is particularly appropriate for Derrida, since his thought\nconcerns precisely the idea of purity and therefore contamination.\nContamination, in Derrida, implies that an opposition consisting in\ntwo pure poles separated by an indivisible line never exists. In other\nwords, traditionally (going back to Plato’s myths but also Christian\ntheology), we think that there was an original pure state of being\n(direct contact with the forms or the Garden of Eden) which\naccidentally became corrupt. In contrast, Derrida tries to show that\nno term or idea or reality is ever pure in this way; one term always\nand necessarily “infects” the other. \n\nNevertheless, for Derrida, a kind of purity remains as a value. In his\n1992 The Monolingualism of the Other, Derrida speaks of his\n“shameful intolerance” for anything but the purity of the\nFrench language (as opposed to French contaminated with English words\nlike “le weekend”). Derrida says, “I still do not\ndare admit this compulsive demand for a purity of language except\nwithin boundaries of which I can be sure: this demand is neither\nethical, political, nor social. It does not inspire any judgment in\nme.  It simply exposes me to suffering when someone, who can be\nmyself, happens to fall short of it. I suffer even further when I\ncatch myself or am caught ‘red-handed’ in the\nact. … Above all, this demand remains so inflexible that it\nsometimes goes beyond the grammatical point of view, it even neglects\n‘style’ in order to bow to a more hidden rule, to\n‘listen’ to the domineering murmur of an order which\nsomeone in me flatters himself to understand, even in situations where\nhe would be the only one to do so, in a tête-à-tête\nwith the idiom, the final target: a last will of the language, in sum,\na law of the language that would entrust itself only to me. …I\ntherefore admit to a purity which is not very pure. Anything but a\npurism. It is, at least, the only impure ‘purity’ for\nwhich I dare confess a taste” (Monolingualism,\np. 46). Derrida’s taste for purity is such that he seeks the idioms of\na language. The idioms of a language are what make the language\nsingular. An idiom is so pure that we seem unable to translate it out\nof that language. For example, Derrida always connects the French\nidiom “il faut,” “it is necessary,” to\n“une faute,” “a fault” and to “un\ndéfaut,” “a defect”; but we cannot make this\nlinguistic connection between necessity and a fault in English. This\nidiom seems to belong alone to French; it seems as though it cannot be\nshared; so far, there is no babble of several languages in the one\nsole French language. And yet, even within one language, an idiom can\nbe shared. Here is another French idiom: “il y va d’un certain\npas.” Even in French, this idiom can be “translated.” On the one\nhand, if one takes the “il y va” literally, one has a\nsentence about movement to a place (“y”: there) at a\ncertain pace (“un certain pas”: a certain step). On the\nother hand, if one takes the “il y va” idiomatically\n(“il y va”: what is at issue), one has a sentence (perhaps\nmore philosophical) about the issue of negation (“un certain\npas”: “a certain kind of not”).  This undecidability\nin how to understand an idiom within one sole language indicates that,\nalready in French, in the one French language, there is already\ntranslation and, as Derrida would say, “Babelization.”\nTherefore, for Derrida, “a pure language” means a language\nwhose terms necessarily include a plurality of senses that cannot be\nreduced down to one sense that is the proper meaning. In other words,\nthe taste for purity in Derrida is a taste for impropriety and\ntherefore impurity. The value of purity in Derrida means that anyone\nwho conceives language in terms of proper or pure meanings must be\ncriticized. \n\nAlready we are very close to Derrida’s basic argumentation.  The basic\nargumentation always attempts to show that no one is able to separate\nirreplaceable singularity and machine-like repeatability (or\n“iterability,” as Derrida frequently says) into two\nsubstances that stand outside of one another; nor is anyone able to\nreduce one to the other so that we would have one pure substance (with\nattributes or modifications).  Machine-like repeatability and\nirreplaceable singularity, for Derrida, are like two forces that\nattract one another across a limit that is indeterminate and\ndivisible. Yet, to understand the basic argumentation, we must be, as\nDerrida himself says in Rogues, “responsible guardians\nof the heritage of transcendental idealism” (Rogues,\np. 134; see also Limited Inc, p. 93). Kant had of course\nopened up the possibility of this way of philosophizing: arguing back\n(Kant called this arguing back a “deduction”) from the\ngivenness of experience to the conditions that are necessarily\nrequired for the way experience is given. These conditions would\nfunction as a foundation for all experience. Following Kant (but also\nHusserl and Heidegger), Derrida then is always interested in necessary\nand foundational conditions of experience. \n\nSo, let us start with the simplest argument that we can formulate.\nIf we reflect on experience in general, what we cannot deny is that\nexperience is conditioned by time. Every experience, necessarily, takes\nplace in the present. In the present experience, there is the kernel or\npoint of the now. What is happening right now is a kind of event,\ndifferent from every other now I have ever experienced. Yet, also in\nthe present, I remember the recent past and I anticipate what is about\nto happen. The memory and the anticipation consist in repeatability.\nBecause what I experience now can be immediately recalled, it is\nrepeatable and that repeatability therefore motivates me to anticipate\nthe same thing happening again. Therefore, what is happening right now\nis also not different from every other now I have ever\nexperienced. At the same time, the present experience is an\nevent and it is not an event because it is repeatable. This “at\nthe same time” is the crux of the matter for Derrida. The\nconclusion is that we can have no experience that does not essentially\nand inseparably contain these two agencies of event and\nrepeatability. \n\nThis basic argument contains four important implications.\nFirst, experience as the experience of the present is never a\nsimple experience of something present over and against me, right\nbefore my eyes as in an intuition; there is always another agency\nthere. Repeatability contains what has passed away and is no longer\npresent and what is about to come and is not yet present. The\npresent therefore is always complicated by non-presence. Derrida calls\nthis minimal repeatability found in every experience “the\ntrace.” Indeed, the trace is a kind of proto-linguisticality\n(Derrida also calls it “arche-writing”), since language in\nits most minimal determination consists in repeatable forms.\nSecond, the argument has disturbed the traditional structure\nof transcendental philosophy, which consists in a linear relation\nbetween foundational conditions and founded experience. In traditional\ntranscendental philosophy (as in Kant for example), an empirical event\nsuch as what is happening right now is supposed to be\nderivative from or founded upon conditions which are not\nempirical. Yet, Derrida’s basic argument demonstrates that the\nempirical event is a non-separable part of the structural or\nfoundational conditions. Or, in traditional transcendental philosophy,\nthe empirical event is supposed to be an accident that overcomes an\nessential structure. But with Derrida’s argument, we see that this\naccident cannot be removed or eliminated. We can describe this second\nimplication in still another way. In traditional philosophy we always\nspeak of a kind of first principle or origin and that origin is always\nconceived as self-identical (again something like a Garden of Eden\nprinciple). Yet, here we see that the origin is immediately divided,\nas if the “fall” into division, accidents, and empirical\nevents has always already taken place. In Of Spirit, Derrida\ncalls this kind of origin “origin-heterogeneous”: the\norigin is heterogeneous immediately (Of Spirit, pp.\n107–108). Third, if the origin is always heterogeneous, then\nnothing is ever given as such in certainty. Whatever is given\nis given as other than itself, as already past or as still to come.\nWhat becomes foundational therefore in Derrida is this\n“as”: origin as the heterogeneous “as.” The\n“as” means that there is no knowledge as such, there is no\ntruth as such, there is no perception, no intuition of anything as such. Faith, perjury, and\nlanguage are already there in the origin. Fourth, if\nsomething like a fall has always already taken place, has taken place\nessentially or necessarily, then every experience contains an aspect\nof lateness.  It seems as though I am always late for the origin since\nit seems to have always already disappeared. Every experience then is\nalways not quite on time or, as Derrida quotes Hamlet, time is\n“out of joint.” Late in his career, Derrida will call this\ntime being out of joint “anachronism” (see for instance\nOn the Name, p. 94). As we shall see in a moment, anachronism\nfor Derrida is the flip side of what he calls “spacing”\n(espacement); space is out of place. But we should also keep\nin mind, as we move forward that the phrase “out of joint”\nalludes to justice: being out of joint, time is necessarily unjust or\nviolent. \n\nSo far, we can say that the argument is quite simple although it has\nwide-ranging implications. It is based on an analysis of experience,\nbut it is also based in the experience of what Derrida has called\n“auto-affection.” We find the idea of auto-affection (or\nself-affection) in ancient Greek philosophy, for example in\nAristotle’s definition of God as “thought thinking\nitself.” Auto-affection occurs when I affect myself, when the\naffecting is the same as the affected. As we said above, Derrida will\nfrequently write about autobiography as a form of auto-affection or\nself-relation. In the very late The Animal that Therefore I\nam, Derrida tells us what he is trying to do with auto-affection:\n“if the auto-position, the automonstrative autotely of\nthe ‘I,’ even in the human, implies the ‘I’ to\nbe an other that must welcome within itself some irreducible\nhetero-affection (as I [that is, Derrida] have tried to\ndemonstrate elsewhere [my emphasis]), then this autonomy of\nthe ‘I’ can be neither pure nor rigorous; it would not be\nable to form the basis for a simple and linear differentiation of the\nhuman from the animal” (The Animal that Therefore I am,\np. 95). Always, Derrida tries to show that auto-affection is\nhetero-affection; the experience of the same (I am thinking about\nmyself) is the experience of the other (insofar as I think about\nmyself I am thinking of someone or something else at the same\ntime). But, in order to understand more fully the basic argumentation,\nlet us look at three of these “other places” where Derrida\nhas “attempted” to show that an irreducible\nhetero-affection infects auto-affection. \n\nThe first occurs in Voice and Phenomenon, Derrida’s\n1967 study of Husserl. While this is a small book, it aims to\ncriticize what Husserl calls the “principle of all principles” for\nphenomenology, that is, that evidentness is based in an intuition,\nintuition being different from a sign (Husserl 2014, 43–44,\nparagraph 24). In Voice and Phenomenon Derrida recognizes\nthat perception, for Husserl, is that of adumbrations, with an\nintentional meaning unifying the different profiles. However, Derrida\nsees in the principle of all principles and in Husserl's introduction\nof an Idea in the Kantian sense (Husserl 2014, 284–285,\nparagraph 143) the imposition of a telos for perception towards a pure\nintuition, pure presence or givenness, uncontaminated by\nsignification. \nMore specifically, Derrida argues that, when Husserl describes\nlived-experience (Erlebnis), even absolute subjectivity, he\nis speaking of an interior monologue, auto-affection as\nhearing-oneself-speak. According to Derrida, hearing-oneself-speak\nis, for Husserl, “an auto-affection of an absolutely\nunique type” (Voice and Phenomenon, p. 67). It is\nunique because there seems to be no external detour from the hearing\nto the speaking; in hearing-oneself-speak there is self-proximity. It\nseems therefore that I hear myself speak immediately in the very\nmoment that I am speaking. According to Derrida, Husserl’s\nown description of temporalization however undermines the idea that I\nhear myself speak immediately. On the one hand, Husserl describes what\nhe calls the “living present,” the present that I am\nexperiencing right now, and yet Husserl also says\nthat the living present is thick. The living present is thick because\nit includes phases other than the now, in particular, what Husserl\ncalls “protention,” the anticipation (or\n“awaiting,” we might say) of the approaching future and\n“retention,” the memory of the recent past. As is well\nknown, Derrida focuses on the status of retention in Voice and\nPhenomenon. Retention in Husserl has a strange status since\nHusserl wants to include it in the present as a kind of perception and\nat the same time he recognizes that it is different from the present\nas a kind of non-perception. For Derrida, Husserl’s descriptions imply\nthat the living present, by always folding the recent past back into\nitself, by always folding primary memory into the present perception, involves a\ndifference in the very middle of it (Voice and\nPhenomenon, p. 56). In other words, in the very moment, when\nsilently I speak to myself, it must be the case that there is a\nminiscule hiatus differentiating me into the speaker and into the\nhearer. There must be a hiatus that differentiates me from myself, a\nhiatus or gap without which I would not be a hearer as well\nas a speaker. This hiatus also defines the trace, a minimal\nrepeatability. And this hiatus, this fold of repetition, is found in\nthe very moment of hearing-myself-speak.  Derrida stresses that\n“moment” or “instant” translates the German\n“Augenblick,” which literally means “blink of the\neye.” When Derrida stresses the literal meaning of\n“Augenblick,” he is in effect “deconstructing”\nauditory auto-affection into visual auto-affection. When I look in the\nmirror, for example, it is necessary that I am “distanced”\nor “spaced” from the mirror. I must be distanced from\nmyself so that I am able to be both seer and\nseen. The space between, however, remains obstinately\ninvisible. Remaining invisible, the space gouges out the eye, blinds\nit. I see myself over there in the mirror and yet, that self over\nthere is other than me; so, I am not able to see myself as such. What\nDerrida is trying to demonstrate here is that this\n“spacing” (espacement) or blindness is\nessentially necessary for all forms of auto-affection, even tactile\nauto-affection which seems to be immediate. \n\nNow, let us go to another “other place,” which can be\nfound in “How to Avoid Speaking.” Here Derrida discusses\nnegative theology by means of the idea of\n“dénégation,” “denegation” or\n“denial.” The French word\n“dénégation” translates Freud’s term\n“Verneinung.” Both words’ prefixes imply an emphasis of\nnegation (although the French prefix also implies a negation of a\nnegation). Yet, within psychoanalysis and in particular in Freud, the\nterm ,“Verneinung” implies that when the patient denies a\ndesire or wish, he or she has indicated to the analyst precisely what\nhe or she unconsciously desires or wishes. The denial then functions\nas a sort of disguised confirmation of the analyst’s interpretation of\nthe patient’s symptoms or problem. In short, and this is what Derrida\nis most interested in, psychoanalysis has isolated a negation which is\nin fact an affirmation. The fundamental question then for negative\ntheology, but also for psychoanalysis, and for Derrida is how to deny\nand yet also not deny. This duality between not telling and\ntelling is why Derrida takes up the idea of the secret. In “How\nto Avoid Speaking,” Derrida says, and this is an important\ncomment for understanding the secret in Derrida: “There is a\nsecret of denial [dénégation] and a denial\n[dénégation] of the secret. The secret as\nsuch, as secret, separates and already institutes a negativity;\nit is a negation that denies itself. It de-negates itself”\n(Languages of the Unsayable, p. 25, my emphasis). Here\nDerrida speaks of a secret as such. A secret as such is\nsomething that must not be spoken; we then have the first negation:\n“I promise\nnot to give the secret away.” And yet, in order to\npossess a secret really, to have it really, I must\ntell it to myself. Here we can see the relation of\nhearing-oneself-speak that we just saw in Voice and\nPhenomenon. Keeping a secret includes necessarily auto-affection:\nI must speak to myself of the secret. We might however say more, we\nmight even say that I am too weak for this speaking of the secret to\nmyself not to happen. I must have a conceptual grasp of it; I have to\nframe a representation of the secret. With the idea of a\nre-presentation (I must present the secret to myself again in\norder to possess it really), we also see retention, repetition, and\nthe trace or a name. A trace of the secret must be formed, in which\ncase, the secret is in principle shareable. If the secret must be\nnecessarily shareable, it is always already shared. In other words, in\norder to frame the representation of the secret, I must negate the\nfirst negation, in which I promised not to tell the secret: I must\ntell the secret to myself as if I were someone else. I thereby make a\nsecond negation, a so to speak “de-” or\n“un-negation,” which means I must break the promise not to\ntell the secret. In order to keep the secret (or the promise), I must\nnecessarily not keep the secret (I must violate the promise). So, I\npossess the secret and do not possess it. This structure has the\nconsequence of there being no secret as such. A secret is\nnecessarily shared. As Derrida says in “How to Avoid\nSpeaking,” \n\nNow, finally, let us go to one of the most recent of Derrida’s\nwritings, to his 2002 “The Reason of the Strongest,” the\nfirst essay in the book called Rogues. There Derrida is\ndiscussing the United Nations, which he says combines the two\nprinciples of Western political thought: sovereignty and democracy.\nBut, “democracy and sovereignty are at the same time, but also\nby turns, inseparable and in contradiction with one another”\n(Rogues, p. 100). Democracy and sovereignty contradict one\nanother in the following way. And here Derrida is speaking of pure\nsovereignty, the very “essence of sovereignty”\n(Rogues, p. 100). On the one hand, in order to be sovereign,\none must wield power oneself, take responsibility for its use by\noneself, which means that the use of power, if it is to be sovereign,\nmust be silent; the sovereign does not have to give reasons; the\nsovereign must exercise power in secret. In other words, sovereignty\nattempts to possess power indivisibly, it tries not to share,\nand not sharing means contracting power into an instant—the\ninstant of action, of an event, of a singularity. We can see the\noutline here of Derrida’s deconstruction not only of the\nhearing-oneself-speak auto-affection but also of the auto-affection of\nthe promising-to-oneself to keep a secret. On the other hand,\ndemocracy calls for the sovereign to share power, to give reasons, to\nuniversalize. In democracy the use of power therefore is always an\nabuse of power (see Haddad 2013, pp. 51–65). Derrida can also say that\nsovereignty and democracy are inseparable from one another (the\ncontradiction makes them heterogeneous to one another) because\ndemocracy even though it calls for universalization (giving reasons in\nan assembly) also requires force, freedom, a decision, sovereign\npower. For Derrida, in democracy, a decision (the use of power) is\nalways urgent; and yet (here is the contradiction), democracy takes\ntime, democracy makes one wait so that the use of power can be\ndiscussed. Power can never be exercised without its communication; as\nDerrida says, “As soon as I speak to the other, I submit to the\nlaw of giving reason(s), I share a virtually universalizable medium, I\ndivide my authority” (Rogues, p. 101). There must be\nsovereignty, and yet, there can be no use of power without the sharing\nof it through repetition. More precisely, as Derrida says,\n“Since [sovereignty] never succeeds in [not sharing] except in a\ncritical, precarious, and unstable fashion, sovereignty can\nonly tend, for a limited time, to reign without sharing. It\ncan only tend toward imperial hegemony. To make use of the time is\nalready an abuse” (Rogues, p. 102, Derrida’s\nemphasis). This tendency defines what Derrida calls “the\nworst,” a tendency toward the complete appropriation or\nextermination of all the others. \n\nThroughout his career, Derrida elaborates on the basic argumentation\nin many ways. But Derrida always uses the argumentation against one\nidea, which Derrida calls “the worst” (le pire).\nWe can extract a definition of the worst from “Faith and\nKnowledge” (Religion, p. 65). It revolves around an\nambiguous phrase “plus d’un,” which could be translated in\nEnglish as “more than one,” “more of one,” or\n“no more one.” On the one hand, this phrase means that in\nauto-affection, even while it is “auto,” the same, there\nis more than one; immediately with one, there is two, the self and\nother, and others. On the other hand, it means that there is a lot\nmore of one, only one, the most one. The worst derives from this\nsecond sense of “plus d’un.” The worst is a superlative;\nit is the worst violence. Derrida, it seems, distinguishes the worst\nviolence from what Kant had called “radical evil.” Radical\nevil is literally radical, evil at the root. It consists in the small,\n“infinitesimal difference” (see Of Grammatology,\np. 234) between me and an other, even between me and an other in\nme. Derrida would describe this infinitesimal hiatus as the address,\nthe “à” or the “to”; it is not only\ndifference, across the distance of the address, it is also\nrepetition. And, it is not only a repetition; this self-divergence is\nalso violence, a rending of oneself, an incision. Derrida’s\nappropriation of Kant’s idea of radical evil has led certain\ncommentators to stress a kind of fundamental atheism in Derrida\ndespite the fact that he seems very interested in religion and faith\n(see Hägglund, 2008, pp. 112–113; for an opposing viewpoint, see\nCaputo, 1999, p. 312). Despite this controversy around Derrida’s\nalleged theism or atheism, it looks as though, for him, radical evil\nis not absolute evil (see Philosophy in a Time of Terror,\np. 99). The worst violence occurs when the other to which one\nis related is completely appropriated to or\ncompletely in one’s self, when an address reaches its\nproper destination, when it reaches only its proper\ndestination. Reaching only its proper destination, the\naddress will exclude more, many more, and that “many\nmore,” at the limit, amounts to all. It is this\ncomplete exclusion or this extermination of the most\n– there is no limit to this violence—that makes this\nviolence the worst violence. The worst is a relation that makes of\nmore than one simply one, that makes, out of a division, an\nindivisible sovereignty. We can see again that the worst resembles the\n“pure actuality” of Aristotle’s Prime Mover, the One God:\nthe sphere, or better, the globe of thought thinking itself\n(Rogues, p. 15). \n\nWhat we have just laid out is the structure of the worst in\nDerrida’s thinking. But the structure, for Derrida, can always\nhappen as an event. Derrida thinks that today, “in a time of\nterror,” after the end of the Cold War, when globalization is\ntaking place, the fragility of the nation-state is being tested more\nand more. Agencies such as the International Criminal Court, the demand\nfor universal human rights encroach on nation-state sovereignty. But\nthe result of this universalization or “worlding”\n(“mondialisation” is the French word for globalization) is\nthat the concept of war, and thus of world war, of enemy, and even of\nterrorism, along with the distinctions between civilian and military or\nbetween army, police, and militia, all of these concepts and\ndistinctions are losing their pertinence. As Derrida says here in\nRogues “what is called September 11 will not have\ncreated or revealed this situation, although it will have surely\nmedia-theatricalized it” (Rogues, pp. 154–55). Now, with\nglobalization, there is no identifiable enemy in the form of a\n“state” territory with whom one (in Rogues Derrida\nuses this phrase: “the United States and its allies”) would\nwage what could still be called a “war,” even if we think\nof this as a war on international terrorism. The balance of terror of\nthe Cold War that insured that no escalation of nuclear weapons would\nlead to a suicidal operation, Derrida says, “all that is\nover.” Instead, “a new violence is being prepared and in\ntruth has been unleashed for some time now, in a way that is more\nvisibly suicidal or auto-immune than ever. This violence no longer has\nto do with world war or even with war, even less with\nsome right to wage war. And this is hardly re-assuring – indeed,\nquite the contrary” (Rogues, p. 156). \n\nWhat does it mean to be “more suicidal”? To be more\nsuicidal is to kill oneself more. The “more” means\nthat, since there is only a fragile distinction between states (there\nis no identification of the enemy), one’s state or self includes\nmore and more of the others. But, if one’s self includes others\nthat threaten (so-called “terrorist cells,” for example),\nthen, if one wants to immune oneself, then one must murder more and\nmore of those others that are inside. Since the others are\ninside one’s state or one’s self, one is required\nto kill more and more of oneself. This context is very different from\nthe rigid and external opposition, symbolized by the so-called\n“Iron Curtain,” that defined the Cold War. There and then,\n“we” had an identifiable enemy, with a name, which\nallowed the number of the enemies to be limited. But here and now,\ntoday, the number of “enemies” is potentially unlimited.\nEvery other is wholly other (“tout autre est\ntout autre” [cf. The Politics of Friendship, p. 232])\nand thus every single other needs to be rejected by the immune system.\nThis innumerable rejection resembles a genocide or what is worse an\nabsolute threat. The absolute threat can no longer be contained when it\ncomes neither from an already constituted state nor even from a\npotential state that might be treated as a rogue state\n(Rogues, p. 105). What Derrida is saying here is that the\nworst is possible, here and now, more possible than ever. \n\nAs I said, Derrida always uses the basic argumentation that we have\nlaid out against the idea of the worst; today the tendency towards the\nworst is greater than ever. The purpose in the application –\nthis purpose defines deconstruction—is to move us towards, not\nthe worst violence, not the most violence, but the least violence\n(Writing and Difference, p. 130). How does the application of\nthe argumentation against the worst work? Along with globalization,\nthe post-Cold War period sees, as Derrida says in “Faith and\nKnowledge,” a “return of the religious”\n(Religion, pp. 42–43; see also Caputo 1997, pp. 152–159). So,\nin “Faith and Knowledge,” Derrida lays out the etymology\nof the Latin word “religion” (he acknowledges that the\netymology is problematic). The etymology implies that there are\n“two sources” of religion: “religio,” which\nimplies a holding back or a being unscathed, safe and sound; and\n“re-legere,” which implies a linking up with another\nthrough faith (Religion, p. 16). We can see in this etymology\nthe inseparable dualities we examined above: singular event and\nmachine-like repeatability; auto-affection as hetero-affection. Most\nimportantly, Derrida is trying to understand the “link”\nthat defines religion prior to the link between man as such and the\ndivinity of God. What we can see in this attempt to conceive the link\nas it is prior to its determination in terms of man and God is an\nattempt to make the link be as open as possible. Derrida is attempting\nto “un-close,” as much as possible, the sphericity or\nenglobing of thought thinking itself – in order to open the link\nas wide as possible, open it to every single other, to any other\nwhatsoever. Throughout his career, Derrida is always interested in the\nstatus of animality since it determines the limit between man and\nothers. As his final book demonstrates, L’animal que donc je\nsuis, Derrida is attempting to open the link even to animals.\nAnimals are other and, because “every other is wholly\nother” (tout autre est tout autre), the link must be\nopen to them too. Here despite the immense influence they have had on\nhis thought, Derrida breaks with both Heidegger and Levinas both of\nwhom did not open the link this wide (see Points, p. 279).\nHere, with the “door” or “border” open as wide\nas possible, we encounter Derrida’s idea of “unconditional\nhospitality,” which means letting others in no matter what,\nwithout asking them for papers, without judging them, even when they\nare uninvited. All are to be treated not as enemies who must be\nexpelled or exterminated, but as friends. Nevertheless, as Derrida\nconstantly stresses, we cannot really identify the friend as\nsuch. Unconditional hospitality is dangerous. \n\nThis danger explains why unconditional openness of the borders is not\nthe best (as opposed to what we were calling the worst above); it is\nonly the less bad or less evil, the less violence. Indeed, it looks as\nthough the unconditional opening is not possible. There always seems\nto be factual conditions. Among all the others we must decide, we must\nassign them papers, which means that there is always, still,\nnecessarily violence at the borders. At once, in hospitality, there is\nthe force that moves towards to the other to welcome and the force to\nremain unscathed and pulled back from the other, trying to keep the\ndoor closed. Here too, in hospitality, we see Derrida’s idea of a\n“messianicity without messiah.” Because letting all the\nothers in is impossible (but we must note that Derrida’s concept of\npossibility or virtuality, of the “perhaps,” is complicated; see in\nparticular Politics of Friendship, p. 29), this de-closing is\nalways to come in the future like the messiah coming or coming back\n(Derrida plays on the French word for the future,\n“l’avenir,” which literally means “to come,”\n“à venir”).  We must make one more point. The\nimpossibility of unconditional hospitality means that any attempt to\nopen the globe completely is insufficient. Being insufficient, every\nattempt therefore requires criticism; it must be\n“deconstructed,” as Derrida would say. But this\ndeconstruction would be a deconstruction that recognizes its own\ninsufficiency. Deconstruction, to which we now turn, never therefore\nresults in good conscience, in the good conscience that comes with\nthinking we have done enough to render justice. \n\nAs we said at the beginning, “deconstruction” is the\nmost famous of Derrida’s terms. He seems to have appropriated the\nterm from Heidegger’s use of “destruction” in\nBeing and Time. But we can get a general sense of what Derrida\nmeans with deconstruction by recalling Descartes’s First\nMeditation. There Descartes says that for a long time he has been\nmaking mistakes. The criticism of his former beliefs both mistaken and\nvalid aims towards uncovering a “firm and permanent\nfoundation.” The image of a foundation implies that the\ncollection of his former beliefs resembles a building. In the First\nMeditation then, Descartes is in effect taking down this old building,\n“de-constructing” it. We have also seen how much Derrida is\nindebted to traditional transcendental philosophy which really starts\nhere with Descartes’ search for a “firm and permanent\nfoundation.” But with Derrida, we know now, the foundation is not\na unified self but a divisible limit between myself and myself as an\nother (auto-affection as hetero-affection:\n“origin-heterogeneous”). \n\nDerrida has provided many definitions of deconstruction. But three\ndefinitions are classical. The first is early, being found in\nthe 1971 interview “Positions” and in the 1972 Preface to\nDissemination: deconstruction consists in “two\nphases” (Positions, pp. 41–42,\nDissemination, pp.4–6). At this stage of his career\nDerrida speaks of “metaphysics” as if the Western\nphilosophical tradition was monolithic and homogeneous. At times he\nalso speaks of “Platonism,” as Nietzsche did. Simply,\ndeconstruction is a criticism of Platonism, which is defined by the\nbelief that existence is structured in terms of oppositions (separate\nsubstances or forms) and that the oppositions are hierarchical, with\none side of the opposition being more valuable than the other. The\nfirst phase of deconstruction attacks this belief by\nreversing the Platonistic hierarchies: the hierarchies\nbetween the invisible or intelligible and the visible or sensible;\nbetween essence and appearance; between the soul and body; between\nliving memory and rote memory; between mnēmē and\nhypomnēsis; between voice and writing; between finally\ngood and evil. In order to clarify deconstruction’s “two\nphases,” let us restrict ourselves to one specific opposition,\nthe opposition between appearance and essence. Prior to Derrida,\nNietzsche had also criticized this opposition, and it is criticized in\na lot of Twentieth Century philosophy. So, in Platonism, essence is\nmore valuable than appearance. In deconstruction however, we reverse\nthis, making appearance more valuable than essence.  How? Here we\ncould resort to empiricist arguments (in Hume for example) that show\nthat all knowledge of what we call essence depends on the experience\nof what appears. But then, this argumentation would imply that essence\nand appearance are not related to one another as separate oppositional\npoles. The argumentation in other words would show us that essence can\nbe reduced down to a variation of appearances (involving the roles of\nmemory and anticipation). The reduction is a reduction to what we can\ncall “immanence,” which carries the sense of\n“within” or “in.” So, we would say that what\nwe used to call essence is found in appearance, essence is\nmixed into appearance. Now, we can back track a bit in the\nhistory of Western metaphysics. On the basis of the reversal of the\nessence-appearance hierarchy and on the basis of the reduction to\nimmanence, we can see that something like a decision (a perhaps\nimpossible decision) must have been made at the beginning of the\nmetaphysical tradition, a decision that instituted the hierarchy of\nessence-appearance and separated essence from appearance. This\ndecision is what really defines Platonism or\n“metaphysics.” After this retrospection, we can turn now\nto a second step in the reversal-reduction of Platonism, which is the\nsecond “phase” of deconstruction. The previously inferior\nterm must be re-inscribed as the “origin” or\n“resource” of the opposition and hierarchy itself. How\nwould this re-inscription or redefinition of appearance work? Here we\nwould have to return to the idea that every appearance or every\nexperience is temporal. In the experience of the present, there is\nalways a small difference between the moment of now-ness and the past\nand the future. (It is perhaps possible that Hume had already\ndiscovered this small difference when, in the Treatise, he\nspeaks of the idea of relation.) In any case, this infinitesimal\ndifference is not only a difference that is non-dualistic, but also it\nis a difference that is, as Derrida would say,\n“undecidable.” Although the minuscule difference is\nvirtually unnoticeable in everyday common experience, when we in fact\nnotice it, we cannot decide if we are experiencing a memory\nor a present perception, if we are experiencing a present perception\nor an anticipation. (Bergson makes a similar claim in his\n“Memory of the Present and False Recognition”\n[Mind-Energy, pp. 109–151] and Deleuze extends\nBergson's insight in his “The Actual and the Virtual”\n[Dialogues, pp. 148–152].) When we notice the\ndifference, we are indeed experiencing the present, but the present is\nrecognized as “contaminated” by the past and\nfuture. Insofar as the difference is undecidable (perception –\nwhat we see right now – contaminated with memory or the present\ncontaminated with the past: the experienced difference is an\nexperience of what Derrida would call the “trace”), the\ndifference destabilizes the original decision that instituted the\nhierarchy. After the redefinition of the previously inferior term,\nDerrida usually changes the term’s orthography, for example,\nwriting “différence” with an “a” as\n“différance” in order to indicate the\nchange in its status. Différance (which is found in appearances\nwhen we recognize their temporal nature) then refers to the\nundecidable resource into which “metaphysics”\n“cut” in order to makes its decision. In\n“Positions,” Derrida calls names like\n“différance” “old names” or\n“paleonyms,” and there he also provides a list of these\n“old terms”: “pharmakon”;\n“supplement”; “trace”; “hymen”;\n“gram”; “spacing”; and “incision”\n(Positions, p. 43). These names are old because, like the\nword “appearance” or the word “difference,”\nthey have been used for centuries in the history of Western philosophy\nto refer to the inferior position in hierarchies. But now, they are\nbeing used to refer to the resource that has never had a name in\n“metaphysics”; they are being used to refer to the\nresource that is indeed “older” than the metaphysical\ndecision. \n\nThis first definition of deconstruction as two phases gives way to the\nrefinement we find in the “Force of Law” (which dates from\n1989–1990). This second definition is less metaphysical and\nmore political. In “Force of Law,” Derrida says that\ndeconstruction is practiced in two styles (Deconstruction and the\nPossibility of Justice, p. 21). These “two styles” do\nnot correspond to the “two phases” in the earlier\ndefinition of deconstruction. On the one hand, there is the\ngenealogical style of deconstruction, which recalls the history of a\nconcept or theme. Earlier in his career, in Of Grammatology,\nDerrida had laid out, for example, the history of the concept of\nwriting. But now what is at issue is the history of justice. On the\nother hand, there is the more formalistic or structural style of\ndeconstruction, which examines a-historical paradoxes or aporias. In\n“Force of Law,” Derrida lays out three aporias, although\nthey all seem to be variants of one, an aporia concerning the unstable\nrelation between law (the French term is “droit,” which\nalso means “right”) and justice. \n\nDerrida calls the first aporia, “the epoche\nof the rule” (Deconstruction and the Possibility of\nJustice, pp. 22–23). Our most common axiom in ethical or political\nthought is that to be just or unjust and to exercise justice, one must\nbe free and responsible for one’s actions and decisions. Here\nDerrida in effect is asking: what is freedom. On the one hand, freedom\nconsists in following a rule; but in the case of justice, we would say\nthat a judgment that simply followed the law was only right, not just.\nFor a decision to be just, not only must a judge follow a rule but also\nhe or she must “re-institute” it, in a new judgment. Thus a\ndecision aiming at justice (a free decision) is both regulated and\nunregulated. The law must be conserved and also destroyed or\nsuspended, suspension being the meaning of the word\n“epoche.” Each case is other, each decision is different\nand requires an absolutely unique interpretation which no existing\ncoded rule can or ought to guarantee. If a judge programmatically\nfollows a code, he or she is a “calculating machine.”\nStrict calculation or arbitrariness, one or the other is unjust, but\nthey are both involved; thus, in the present, we cannot say that a\njudgment, a decision is just, purely just. For Derrida, the\n“re-institution” of the law in a unique decision is a kind\nof violence since it does not conform perfectly to the instituted\ncodes; the law is always, according to Derrida, founded in violence.\nThe violent re-institution of the law means that justice is impossible.\nDerrida calls the second aporia “the ghost of the\nundecidable” (Deconstruction and the Possibility of Justice,\npp. 24–26). A decision begins with the initiative to read, to\ninterpret, and even to calculate. But to make such a decision, one must\nfirst of all experience what Derrida calls\n“undecidability.” One must experience that the case, being\nunique and singular, does not fit the established codes and therefore a\ndecision about it seems to be impossible. The undecidable, for Derrida,\nis not mere oscillation between two significations. It is the\nexperience of what, though foreign to the calculable and the rule, is\nstill obligated. We are obligated – this is a kind of duty—to\ngive oneself up to the impossible decision, while taking account of\nrules and law. As Derrida says, “A decision that did not go\nthrough the ordeal of the undecidable would not be a free decision, it\nwould only be the programmable application or unfolding of a calculable\nprocess” (Deconstruction and the Possibility of Justice,\np. 24). And once the ordeal is past (“if this ever\nhappens,” as Derrida says), then the decision has again followed\nor given itself a rule and is no longer presently just. Justice\ntherefore is always to come in the future, it is never present. There\nis apparently no moment during which a decision could be called\npresently and fully just. Either it has not followed a rule, hence it\nis unjust; or it has followed a rule, which has no foundation,\nwhich makes it again unjust; or if it did follow a rule, it\nwas calculated and again unjust since it did not respect the\nsingularity of the case. This relentless injustice is why the ordeal of\nthe undecidable is never past. It keeps coming back like a\n“phantom,” which “deconstructs from the inside every\nassurance of presence, and thus every criteriology that would assure us\nof the justice of the decision” (Deconstruction and the\nPossibility of Justice, pp. 24–25). Even though justice is\nimpossible and therefore always to come in or from the future, justice\nis not, for Derrida, a Kantian ideal, which brings us to the third\naporia. The third is called “the urgency that obstructs\nthe horizon of knowledge” (Deconstruction and the Possibility\nof Justice, pp. 26–28). Derrida stresses the Greek etymology of\nthe word “horizon”: “As its Greek name suggests, a\nhorizon is both the opening and limit that defines an infinite progress\nor a period of waiting.” Justice, however, even though it is\nun-presentable, does not wait. A just decision is always required\nimmediately. It cannot furnish itself with unlimited knowledge. The\nmoment of decision itself remains a finite moment of urgency and\nprecipitation. The instant of decision is then the moment of madness,\nacting in the night of non-knowledge and non-rule. Once again we have a\nmoment of irruptive violence. This urgency is why justice has no\nhorizon of expectation (either regulative or messianic). Justice\nremains an event yet to come. Perhaps one must always say\n“can-be” (the French word for “perhaps” is\n“peut-être,” which literally means “can\nbe”) for justice. This ability for justice aims however towards\nwhat is impossible. \n\nEven later in Derrida’s career he will formalize, beyond these\naporias, the nature of deconstruction. The third definition of\ndeconstruction can be found in an essay from 2000 called “Et\nCetera.” Here Derrida in fact presents the principle that defines\ndeconstruction: \n\nEven though the word “deconstruction” has been bandied\nabout, we can see now the kind of thinking in which deconstruction\nengages. It is a kind of thinking that never finds itself at the end.\nJustice – this is undeniable – is impossible (perhaps\njustice is the “impossible”) and therefore it is necessary\nto make justice possible in countless ways. \n\nFinally, with the publication of the death penalty lectures, we have\nanother definition of deconstruct, one also dating from 2000 (lecture\ndated March 1/8, 2000). Here is what Derrida says: \n\n“No less than that. Death to death”: This shows us that\nperhaps even more than justice deconstruction values (if we can speak\nof a moral value) life more than anything else. But, this life is not\nunscathed; it is life in its irreducible connection to death. Thus\nwhat deconstruction values is survival.","contact.mail":"lul19@psu.edu","contact.domain":"psu.edu"}]
