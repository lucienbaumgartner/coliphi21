Lukács is best known for his\npre-World War II writings in literary theory, aesthetic theory and\nMarxist philosophy. Today, his most widely read works are the\nTheory of the Novel of 1916 and History and Class\nConsciousness of 1923. In History and Class\nConsciousness, Lukács laid out a wide-ranging critique of\nthe phenomenon of “reification” in capitalism and\nformulated a vision of Marxism as a self-conscious transformation of\nsociety. This text became an important reference point both for\ncritical social theory and for many currents of countercultural\nthought. Even though his later work could not capture the imagination\nof the intellectual public as much as his earlier writings,\nLukács remained a prolific writer and an influential theorist in\nhis later career and published hundreds of articles on literary theory\nand aesthetics, not to mention numerous books, including two massive\nworks on aesthetics and ontology. He was also active as a politician\nin Hungary in both the revolution of 1919 and during the events of\n1956. Today, his work remains of philosophical interest not only\nbecause it contains the promise of a reformulation of an undogmatic,\nnon-reductionist Marxism, but also because it connects a philosophical\napproach drawing on Neo-Kantianism, Hegel and Marx with an acute\ncultural sensitivity and a powerful critique of modern life inspired\nby Weber’s and Simmel’s sociological analyses of modern\nrationalization.\n\nGeorg\nLukács was born on April 13, 1885 in Budapest as Bernát\nGyörgy Löwinger. His father, the influential banker\nJózsef Löwinger, changed the Jewish family name to the\nHungarian surname Lukács in 1890. In 1899, the family was\nadmitted into the nobility. Already as a high school student,\nLukács developed a keen interest in literature and especially\ndrama, publishing numerous reviews of theater plays in the Hungarian\npress. Lukács received a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University\nof Kolozsvár in 1906 and a doctorate from the University of\nBudapest in 1909, after submitting parts of his manuscript on the\n“History of the Modern Drama”. In the following nine\nyears, Lukács made a name for himself as a literary and aesthetic\ntheorist with a number of well-received articles. He worked and\nparticipated in intellectual circles in Budapest, Berlin (where he was\ninfluenced by Georg Simmel), Florence and Heidelberg. In 1910\nand 1911, Lukács published his essay collection Soul and\nForm and, together with Lajos Fülep, founded a short-lived\navant-garde journal, A Szellem (The\nSpirit). Lukács’ life was shaken up during that time\nby the death of his close friend Leo Popper and by the suicide of Irma\nSeidler who had been his lover. Lukács felt responsible for\nSeidler’s death and it proved to have an enormous impact on him,\nwhich is reflected in his 1911 essay “On Poverty of\nSpirit”. During the same period, Lukács developed a close connection to\nMax and Marianne Weber in Heidelberg, to Ernst Bloch and to the\nNeo-Kantian philosophers Heinrich Rickert and Emil Lask. Between 1912\nand 1914 he worked on a first attempt to formulate a systematic\napproach to art, which remained unpublished during his lifetime\n(GW 16). After the beginning of the First World War,\nLukács was exempted from the frontline of military service. In\n1914, he married the Russian political activist (and convicted\nterrorist) Jelena Grabenko. In 1913, Lukács began participating in the influential\n“Sunday circle” of Budapest intellectuals, which included\nKarl Mannheim. After returning from wartime service in the Hungarian censor’s office,\nhe published The Theory of the Novel (1916), which is perhaps\nthe best-known work of his early period. In 1917, he left Grabenko and, despite Weber’s support, failed to receive the Habilitation (teaching qualification) at\nthe University of Heidelberg. Between 1916 and 1918 he also resumed\nhis work on aesthetics, resulting in the unpublished manuscript of the\nso-called “Heidelberg Aesthetics” (GW 17). To the\nsurprise of many of his friends, Lukács joined the Hungarian\nCommunist Party in 1918; although, as his essay on “Bolshevism\nas a Moral Problem” attests, not without reservations. After a rapid ascent as one of the leading thinkers of the party,\nLukács became more involved in day-to-day politics: after the\nrevolution in 1919, he first served as a deputy commissar and then as\ncommissar of public education in Béla Kun’s\ngovernment. Later, when war broke out, he served as a political\ncommissar in the Hungarian Red Army (in this position, he also ordered\nthe execution of several soldiers, see Kadarkay 1991: 223). After the\ncommunist government was defeated, Lukács fled to Vienna at the\nend of 1919 where he married his second wife, Gertrud Bortstieber. Being in\ncharge of coordinating the clandestine activities of the exiled\ncommunist party, he remained under constant threat of expulsion to\nHungary. For this reason, after Lukács was arrested, in November\n1919 an appeal (“Save Georg Lukács”) appeared in a\nBerlin newspaper signed by many intellectuals—among them\nHeinrich and Thomas Mann. In 1923, Lukács published his most famous work, the essay\ncollection History and Class Consciousness. In this text,\nLukács argued forcefully for a philosophically refined version\nof Marxism as a solution to the problems that have vexed modern\nphilosophy and developed the idea of society as a\n“totality”—an ontological commitment which is\nderived from Hegel, while at the same time incorporating sociological\ninsights into the character of modern societies which he had acquired\nthrough Weber and Simmel. This reformulation of the philosophical\npremises of Marxism, however, entailed a rejection of the then\ncontemporary forms of simplistic materialism and naive scientism\nendorsed by many Soviet party intellectuals. Unsurprisingly, the party\northodoxy condemned the book as an expression of ultra-leftism (in\nspite of Lukács’ pro-Leninist revisions to the articles\nin the volume which had already appeared previously, see Löwy\n1979: 172–179). Nevertheless, his position as one of the leading\nintellectuals of Marxism was cemented, allowing Lukács to\nparticipate at the forefront of the debates of the time, as for\nexample with a quickly written study on Lenin on the occasion of the\nSoviet leader’s death in 1924. However, in 1928, Lukács\nhad to virtually give up his political activities after he presented\nthe so-called “Blum theses” (see 1928). In this draft of a\nparty platform, which was named after his party alias, he argued for a\ndemocratic dictatorship of workers and peasants in Hungary. These\ntheses were condemned as a right-wing deviation by the party (earning\nhim the status of being condemned both as a left-wing and a right-wing\ndissident within a timeframe of five years). Following another arrest by the Austrian authorities, Lukács\nleft Vienna in 1929 first for Berlin, then for Budapest where he lived\nunderground for three months. Eventually, he was summoned by the\nSoviet party leadership to Moscow where he stayed from 1930 on,\nleaving only for Comintern missions in Berlin and for\nTashkent during the war. In Moscow, Lukács held a position at the\nMarx-Engels Institute. During this time, he first came into contact\nwith Marx’s early works which had previously remained\nunpublished. As Lukács became (at least outwardly) increasingly\nsubservient to the Stalinist orthodoxy (while producing a first\nattempt of a new Marxist aesthetics in The Historical Novel),\nhe publicly retracted his views espoused in History and Class\nConsciousness (see 1933b). The degree of Lukács’\nagreement with Stalinism is disputed to this day (see Lichtheim 1970;\nDeutscher 1972; Kolakowski 1978; Pike 1988). However, it is clear from\nhis writings that he publicly defended Stalinist dogmas both in\naesthetics and politics during the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s (1933a,\n1938, 1951) while criticizing Stalin and Stalinism repeatedly later on\n(see 1957, 1962). In 1944, Lukács returned to Budapest and became a professor at\nthe local university. In 1948, he published his two-volume study titled\nThe Young Hegel (written partly during the 1930s in Moscow)\nand participated in debates about socialist realism in literature. In\n1949, he also traveled to Paris to engage in a debate about\nexistentialism and Marxism with Sartre. The works of this period\nreflect both his allegiance to orthodox Soviet Marxism and his\nuneasiness with the Stalinist post-war situation. A widely criticized\nexample of his writing of this time is The Destruction of\nReason, published in 1954. It denounced much of the German\nphilosophical and literary tradition after Marx as an outgrowth of\n“irrationalism” and as bearing responsibility for the\nascent of National Socialism. During this time, Lukács also\ncontinued to defend a rather conservative ideal of realism in\naesthetics (see 1951). After again being subjected to criticism from the party orthodoxy\nand being virtually excluded from public life in the mid-1950s, the\nHungarian uprising against the Soviet rule in 1956 opened a new\nchapter for Lukács. After Stalin’s death, it became not\nonly increasingly possible for him to publicly criticize Stalinism and\nto voice again, for the first time since 1928, his vision for the\nfuture of Marxism, arguing that the communist party should regain\npublic trust by competing with other leftist forces within a\nmulti-party democracy. He also served in the short-lived Nagy\ngovernment as minister for public education. After the subsequent\nSoviet invasion, he was arrested and imprisoned in Romania. In\ncontrast to other members of the government, he was not executed but\nmerely expelled from the communist party, which he only rejoined in\n1969. From the 1960s on, Lukács—having had to retire from\nall academic positions—worked on his two-volume\nSpecificity of the Aesthetic and on a Marxist ethics, later\npartly transformed into the Ontology of Social Being, which\nhe never finished during his lifetime. He also continued to publish\nextensively on literature and art. Lukács passed away on June 4,\n1971 in Budapest. Lukács’ “early” writings—before his\nturn to Marxism in 1918—are animated by concerns that are also\npresent, albeit transformed, in his later political thought. In this\nperiod, Lukács formulates a sophisticated aesthetic theory and a\ncritique of modern culture that he diagnoses to be\ncharacterized by an insurmountable abyss between objective cultural forms\nand the richness of “genuine life”. He takes up the issue of the relationship between\n“form” and “life” in three different but\nclosely interconnected discussions: First, there is the question of\nhow the element of “form” distinguishes art as a separate\nsphere of value. This is most explicitly discussed in his two attempts\nat a systematic philosophy of art. Second, there is the\nsociological-historical question about the relation between (individual\nand collective) life and the (aesthetic and ethical) forms in modern\nbourgeois society. This topic is dominant\nboth in the History of the Modern Drama of 1909 and in the\nTheory of the Novel of 1916. Finally, a third strand concerns\nexistential and ethical questions, most explicitly discussed in\nSoul and Form and in the essay “On Poverty of\nSpirit”. Next to “form”, two central concepts in\nLukács’ thought are “totality” and\n“life”. With “totality” Lukács refers\nto a whole set of elements that are meaningfully interrelated in such\na way that the essence of each element can only be understood in its\nrelation to the others. “Life”, as Lukács\nunderstands it, is the intrinsic richness and potentiality of\nexperiences and actions of individuals and societies, rather than only\nthe temporal unfolding of empirical lives. Both individual and social\nlife is in principle capable of forming an integrated\ntotality. However, this is only the case if the essential properties\nof its elements are intelligible in terms of their relations to other\nparticulars of life. Only in this case, life can have a meaningful\nform which is not a mere restriction. Lukács claims that this\nwas the case in the times of Homeric Greece where a totality of\nmeaning was immanent to life itself. This immanence of meaning and the\ntotality it constituted was, however, lost in the subsequent\nhistorical development, transforming form into an external factor to\nlife. In regard to the relation between form and life, we can distinguish\nbetween forms that are forms of life itself, produced by that\nlife, and abstract forms which are imposed onto life from the\noutside. When a form is imposed on life that is not a form of\nthat specific mode of life (or if the form in question cannot be\nrealized in empirical life), such an imposition always runs the risk\nof distorting the meanings of the particular actions or persons. But\nat the same time, form is necessary for life to become intelligible\nand unified (see Bernstein 1984: 77–80). Within the sphere of\nindividual agency, persons face this dilemma in regard to the choice\nof either authentically expressing the particular meanings of their\nown life, risking the loss of form and, consequently, the loss of\nintelligible access to these meanings, or of imposing an external form\nas a normative demand on their life, risking distortion,\ninauthenticity and even the denial of life itself. With the exception of the History of the Modern Drama\n(1909), Lukács’ earliest work is self-consciously\nessayistic in form. As Lukács explains in “On the Nature\nand Form of the Essay” (1911a), this is because the essay is the\nprimary form of writing which addresses life through the medium of\nform (1911a: 8) and which takes form (in particular, the form of a\nwork of art) seriously as a reality of its own. Essayistic writing,\nhowever, is not only writing about form; it also must always\nexamine the conditions under which life can be given a form in the\nfirst place. This problem becomes virulent in modernity where the form\nof life is no longer something unproblematically present. Rather, the\nexisting ways in which life could give itself a form have become\nproblematic and are experienced as abstractions. Following Weber, Lukács characterizes the bourgeois form of\nlife in terms of the primacy of an ethics of work and inner\nstrength. Corresponding to this form of life, Lukács claims,\nthere has been a form of art which was capable of expressing an\nunproblematic relationship between life and form (for example, in\nTheodor Storm’s case, the insight that the bourgeois citizen\nmust concentrate on his work and entrust the formation of his life to\nfate, see 1910a: 60). However, when that bourgeois life-form\ndisappeared, the remaining bourgeois “way of life”\ntransformed into a form of asceticism which became hostile against\nlife itself. The same holds true for the corresponding movement within\nart of rejecting life in favor of “art for its own sake”,\nthat is, of a form of artistic production that self-consciously (and\nwith justification) refuses to express life because it has no\nfoundation in a corresponding life form. Lukács thus argues that modern art is caught up in the dilemma\nof having to achieve a harmony of life and form, either at the expense\nof life’s intensity and potentiality, or at a purely symbolic\nand imaginary level—by effectively withdrawing from life (an\nidea he discusses in reference to Novalis, see 1908: 50; see Butler\n2010: 9). In both cases, art turns against life. In contrast, a\ngenuine attempt to give “real” or “absolute\nlife” (that is, genuinely meaningful life as opposed to the\nchaos of “empirical life”, see Márkus 1983: 11;\nLöwy 1979: 104) a distinct form necessarily involves a rejection\nof the meaningless necessities of empirical life. Instead, such an\nattempt must endorse a form of life that cannot be incorporated into\nordinary life. In one of the essays published in Soul and\nForm, titled “The Metaphysics of Tragedy” (1910b),\nLukács ascribes this task to the form of modern tragedy. When\nnature and fate have become “terrifyingly soulless”\n(1910b: 154) and any hope for a “friendly order” (ibid.)\nhas disappeared, the tragic becomes a task—to reject ordinary\nlife in favor of the opportunity to “live within the periphery\nof tragedy” (1910b: 173). The ethical dimension of this relation between life and form\nbecomes most explicit in Lukács’ essay on Kierkegaard and\nin “On Poverty of Spirit”. Kierkegaard’s rejection\nof Regine Olsen’s love is lauded for its expression of the need\nof giving one’s own empirical life a definite, unambiguous form\nand thereby transforming it into absolute life—in\nKierkegaard’s case, by attempting to perform an authentic\ngesture (1910c: 28). But Kierkegaard’s ethical position\nsuffers from a defect: Kierkegaard attempts to reconcile ordinary life\nwith a form that is appropriate for genuine, “absolute”\nlife (that is, he tries to live tragic life as ordinary life). But due to\nits inherent ambiguity and foreignness to form, ordinary life cannot\never be successfully lived in such a way (1910c: 40). Thus,\nKierkegaard’s attempt to live a genuine life was doomed from the\nbeginning. The conclusion of this line of thought seems to point towards an\ninsoluble dilemma. But already the 1911 essay “On Poverty of\nSpirit”—a fusion between an autobiographical reflection\non Lukács’ role in the suicide of Irma Seidler and an\nexamination of theoretical issues—points towards a different\nconclusion: an emphatic rejection of an “ethics of\nduty”. Lukács argues that a formal, rule-based ethics leads\ninto alienation from life. Even though the submission to\n“form” that is implicit in adopting a formalist ethics is\nthe basis from which social life becomes possible in the first place,\nit keeps persons from having “human relationships”. As\nLukács writes, “Form […] is like a bridge that\nseparates” (1911b: 44). Lukács contrasts such an ethics\nwith the ideal of “goodness” which represents “real\nlife” rather than the “impure and sterile” life of\nmost people. “Goodness” involves a rejection of rules as\nwell as duties towards others in favor of pure actions that might be\nsinful, chaotic and futile. The soul of the good person, Lukács\nclaims, “is a pure white slate, upon which fate writes its\nabsurd command” (1911b: 48). This anti-consequentialist and\nanti-deontological ethics of pure action is finally developed into a\nconception of “works”. Only by sacrificing themselves for\nthe sake of works, persons (or, as Lukács’ narrator rather\nclaims, men) can empty themselves of the psychological content of\neveryday life and prepare themselves for the grace of goodness. This\nfinal line of thought already points towards a social utopia: by\novercoming the alienated world of “mechanical forces”\n(1911b: 45) through works that transform life, we may recover a\ngenuine community with and a direct knowledge of others wherein\n“subject and object collapse into each other” (1911b:\n46). This vision of a final overcoming of alienation seems\nto lead out of the theoretical impasse of Lukács’ earlier\nposition, but only at the price of endorsing ethical decisionism and\nmessianism. While Lukács’ cultural criticism intends to capture\ndistinctively modern phenomena, its claims are backed up by an\naesthetic theory that aims to discover the transcendental conditions\nof the aesthetic that are removed from historic variability. Even\nthough Lukács combines these elements in his writing with the\ntheory of culture developed by Georg Simmel and with the Nietzschean\nidea of an intrinsic tension between life and form, his early work\ncannot be comprehended without considering the underlying Neo-Kantian\nframework (for a detailled discussion see Kavoulakos 2014). This\nframework is most clearly visible in his two systematic attempts to\nproduce a philosophy of art in Heidelberg (GW 16 and\n17). Here, Lukács attempts to provide a philosophical\nexplanation of the conditions of possibility of art that takes\nthe work of art as the fundamental phenomenon of aesthetic\nmeaning, rather than deriving this meaning from either artistic\ncreation or aesthetic experience. In his early aesthetic thought, Lukács\ndistinguishes—taking up Neo-Kantian terminology—different\nspheres of reality from each other. The most immediate sphere is the\n“reality of experience” in which everything appears as an\nobject of qualitative experience, or (in the 1916 version) as having a\ngiven object character (Gegenständlichkeit) that is\nfundamentally heterogeneous. Lukács envisages two arguments\nconcerning the role that art can play in relation to this sphere: in\nthe 1912 Philosophy of Art, he argues that any adequate\ncommunication of meaning between persons must appear impossible from\nwithin this sphere, since the infinite qualitative differences of\nexperience cannot ever be successfully communicated. However, the\ninevitable desire to communicate meaning drives people to adopt\ndifferent means of communication that, even though inadequate for\nexpressing the reality of experience, enable persons to overcome their\nseparateness by relating to each other in terms of other spheres of\nreality (for example, the sphere of logical validity). While logic and\nethics constitute “pure” spheres of communicable meaning,\nhowever, the categories of the aesthetic cannot be ever so fully\nseparated from the possibility of experience. In the 1916 Aesthetics, Lukács adopts a more\nradical version of this Neo-Kantian argument: whereas the reality of\neveryday life is characterized by a heterogeneity of forms of objects,\nthe aesthetic sphere of validity is characterized by a distinct form\nof objectivity that is legislated as a norm by experience\nitself. Thus, the contrast between everyday life and art is not one\nbetween experience and validity but between the heterogeneity of\neveryday life and the homogeneous form appropriate to the autonomy of\nexperience (GW 17: 36). Consequently, in comparison to the\nlogical and ethical spheres of validity, aesthetics has a distinct\nstatus. While in these other spheres of validity, objective norms and\nsubjective attitudes are fully separable, the autonomy of experience\nlegislates a normative standard that involves a specific relationship\nbetween subjective experience and objective norm. The value defining the aesthetic sphere, Lukács claims, can\nonly be the work of art itself since this value is presupposed by any\ndescription of artistic production or aesthetic\nexperience. Lukács proposes to explain the character of this\ndistinctive value by undertaking a phenomenological analysis of\nartistic creation and aesthetic receptivity. Even though these\nactivities are not constitutive for the value of works of art, they\ncan still serve as a basis for reconstructing the independent\nnormative status of the aesthetics. The result of this analysis is a\nconception of the work of art as an ideal of homogeneous unity of\nform and material. In the 1912 Philosophy of Art, this\nunity is characterized by the experiential content becoming completely\ncommunicable and containing all possible aspects of a possible\nexperience, thus forming a “concrete totality”\n(GW 16: 83, 91, 112 and GW 17: 110) of its own world\nwithin itself. In contrast, in the 1916 Aesthetics, it is\nbrought about through a process in which the constitutive function of\nexperience becomes completely autonomous, determining both form and\ncontent. Such an ideal work of art is, in virtue of this harmony, a\nUtopian fulfillment of the attitudes that are already operative in the\nordinary world of experience (GW 16: 82). Works of art therefore present us with an “immanent\nutopia” of experience, that is, with the vision of a form of\nexperience that is ordered and unified by a constitutive\n“standpoint” (GW 16: 82) such that form and\ncontent are completely appropriate for each other. Because of these\nfeatures, such an experience embodies a maximum of objectivity in the\nsubject’s relation to an object completely appropriate to its\nsubjectivity (GW 17: 100). This finally answers the question\nregarding the\na priori conditions of art: as an ideal of a particular kind\nof possible experience, the work of art is always historically\nspecific. However, both the potentiality to become a totality\nin virtue of their form and the normative demand to do so are\ntimeless, a priori conditions of the possibility of works of\nart in the Neo-Kantian sense (GW 16: 168). Another aspect of Lukács’ early work is concerned with\nthe historical changes in our relations to form. In his early\nanalysis of the history and sociology of drama (History of the\nModern Drama, 1909), Lukács develops an account of the\nconnection between aesthetic genres and historical changes. He argues\nthat drama is connected to specific historic circumstances: for drama\nto exist, there needs to be a prevailing Weltanschauung\n(GW 15: 44) that seeks drama as its preferred mode of\nexpression. This tragic Weltanschauung only exists in\nperiods of societal disintegration where individual emotions and\nobjective facts are in a relation of mismatch so intense that they\nelicit heroic forms of the denial of social reality. In opposition to mere disintegration without tragedy, Lukács\nclaims that tragedy arises only in one particular kind of historical\nsituation. In each society, the ruling class legitimizes its own\ndominance with reference to certain valuations\n(Wertungen). However, if that class then begins to\nexperience these very same valuations as problematic or sterile, this\nsignifies the beginning of its downfall (GW 15: 47). In such\nsituations, the formal element of drama and tragedy, which involves\nthe paradoxical relation between highly universalized form and highly\nindividualized content, mirrors the paradoxical relation between form\nand life that individuals experience in their own relation to\nsociety. In The Theory of the Novel of 1916, Lukács takes up\nsome of these themes. At the same time, he turns towards a philosophy\nof history in order to clarify the relationship between historical\nchanges of transcendental standpoints and the “pure forms”\nof aesthetic genres. The prime object of his discussion is the epic:\nLukács claims that works of art that belong to this\ngenre—for example Homeric epic poetry and the modern\nnovel—must always express the objective reality of social and\nindividual human life as it is (1916: 46). However, because\nof the distinctive “metaphysical conditions” of different\nepochs, they express this objective reality in radically different\nforms. Epic poetry in Homeric times takes its starting point from a\nworld which constituted a closed totality (1916: 33), that\nis, a world in which life, culture, meaning, action and social\ninstitutions formed a harmonious whole. In particular, Lukács\nclaims that in ancient Greece the “essence” of being was\nimmanent to life rather than having to be sought out in a transcendent\nrealm. Furthermore, there was no gap between individual consciousness\nand objectified meaning in the world that would have required the\nindividual to project meaning onto the world. Individuals in ancient\nGreece only had to accept the totality of meaning within their world,\neven if they were, in some particular situation or another, unable to\nunderstand it. In contrast, modern society is constitutively\nalienated: merely conventional social institutions devoid of meaning\nexist disconnected from individuals and their highly individualized\nself-understanding. Therefore, in modern society meaning can only be\nfound within the inner life of the individual and cannot become\nrecognized in the world (1916: 61). Starting from this description of a closed totality, Lukács\nclaims that the intellectual history of the world is already\nprefigured in the cultural history of ancient Greece within the\nmovement from epic poetry to tragedy and then to philosophy. In the\ncourse of this movement, the sources of meaning became increasingly\nmore external to immediate life. As a consequence, Lukács\nargues that these three genres inhabit three different\n“transcendental loci” (1916: 36) concerning the\nquestion of totality. Tragedy and philosophy have already realized the\nloss of a meaningful totality, whereas the possibility of epic poetry\ndepends on its immanence. As Lukács claims, this is the reason\nfor why “art forms become subject to a historico-philosophical\ndialectic” (1916: 39). The cause for this development is the loss of totality through\nhistorical changes where the objective institutions of social life\nbecame merely conventional, a purely external “second\nnature” (1916: 62f., 112). This alienation of the individual\nfrom her world leads to a situation of “transcendental\nhomelessness” (1916: 40, 60) in which individuals must take up a\npurely normative stance of a “should be” (1916: 47)\ntowards the world. The novel is always relating to the development of\nsuch individuals. This development can take the shape of a\nsubjective-idealist illusion (e.g., as in “Don\nQuixote”) or of a disillusion, that is, of individuals\nunderstanding the impossibility of finding meaning within their\nworld. Lukács thus argues that the novel is the form of epic\nwriting that is appropriate for a specific moment in history. In\nmodernity, epic writing has no longer any distinct form that could\nexpress any particular relation between life and essence within a\ntotality. Rather, the form of the novel is an attempt to deal with the\nabsence of this relation (1916: 59; see Jameson 1971: 172). Lukács’ understanding of alienation as a historical loss\nof totality and the consequent problem of form allows him to also\nformulate the kernel of a Utopian vision: the very form of the novel\npoints to the possibility of a renewed relation between individual and\nworld where meaning can again be found. Lukács sees this utopian\ndimension of modern novels expressed most clearly in Goethe’s\n“Wilhelm Meister”, Tolstoy and Dostoyevski. Lukács’ 1918 conversion to communism and his subsequent\nengagement with philosophical Marxism not only confounded his friends,\neven for today’s readers, it can be difficult to track the many\nshifts in Lukács theoretical commitments between 1918 and\n1923. In the December 1918 article on “Bolshevism as an Ethical\nProblem”, Lukács draws a connection between his newfound\nMarxist convictions and the ethical views he had previously held:\nwhereas the historical necessity of class struggle is only a\ndescriptive claim of Marxism, the normative, ethical\ndemand to to establish a classless society must be separated from any\nissue of truth and be recognized as an Utopian form of ethical\nidealism, appropriate to the expression of a pure will. At this point\nin 1918, Lukács still thinks this insight leads to a paradox:\nIn order for the proletarian “messianic class” (1918: 218)\nto overcome class society, it must first seize power by creating the\nmost extreme form of class dominance, i.e., a dictatorship. Bolshevism\nthus presupposes the conviction that evil actions can produce good\noutcomes, or, as Lukács puts it in the essay on “Tactics\nand Ethics”, that tragedy cannot be avoided in revolutionary\npolitics (1919a: 10). However, by the time\nHistory and Class Consciousness appeared, Lukács seems\nto have thought of himself as having found another conception of\nrevolutionary action that paved the way for a new approach to\npolitical practice. At the foundation of this new conception lies the theory of\nreification that Lukács introduces in the essay on\n“Reification and the consciousness of the\nproletariat”. This essay is not only credited to be one of the\nclassics of Western Marxism, but also as spelling out the paradigmatic\n“central problem” (Brunkhorst and Krockenberger 1998) of\nCritical Theory. Lukács frames his basic argument as an extension of\nMarx’s analysis of the “fetishism of the commodity\nform” in Capital I, whereby Marx refers to the\nphenomenon that social relations between producers of commodities\nappear in capitalism under the guise of objective, calculable,\nproperties of things (“value”). The form which commodities\nacquire due to this fetishism (i.e. a form which furnishes them with\nfeatures that make an instrumental, quantifying attitude towards the\ncommodity appropriate) has gradually become, Lukács claims, the\n“universal category of society as a whole” (1923a: 86). In\ncapitalist societies, the commodity form even becomes the\ndominant form of objectivity itself\n(Gegenständlichkeitsform, a Neo-Kantian term, see also\nFeenberg 2017: 113). This process has both an objective and a\nsubjective dimension: objectively, the qualitative homogeneity and\ncontinuity of human work is destroyed when industrial work processes\nbecome rationalized in a way that is appropriate to understanding them\nas commodity exchanges. Their mechanization and specialization leads\nnot only to a fragmentation of human life but also to the destruction\nof the “organic, irrational and qualitatively determined unity\nof the product” (1923a: 88). On the subjective side, reification\nentails a fragmentation of human experience, leading to an attitude of\n“contemplation” where one passively adapts to a law-like\nsystem of social “second nature” and to an objectifying\nstance towards one’s own mental states and capacities. As Lukács writes about the commodity form, [it] stamps its imprint upon the whole consciousness of man; his\nqualities and abilities are no longer an organic part of his\npersonality, they are things which he can “own” or\n“dispose of” like the various objects of the external\nworld. And there is no natural form in which human relations can be\ncast, no way in which man can bring his physical and psychic\n“qualities” into play without their being subjected\nincreasingly to this reifying process. (1923a: 100) Lukács calls this development “reification”. It is\na process which affects four dimensions of social relations: the\nsocially created features of objects (primarily their features as\ncommodities), the relations between persons, their relations to\nthemselves and, finally, the relations between individuals and society\nas a whole (Stahl 2011). The objective and subjective dimensions of\nthe dominance of the commodity form constitute a complex of\nreification because the properties of objects, subjects and social\nrelations become “thinglike” in a particular way. These\nproperties become independent, quantifiable, non-relational features\nthat must remain alien to any subjective meaning that one could attach\nto them. Additionally, by losing grip of the qualitative dimensions of\ntheir social relations, people become atomized and isolated. With this description of capitalist society, Lukács combines\nWeber’s theory of rationalization, Simmel’s theory of\nmodern culture and his own idea of a contradiction between form and\nlife (see Dannemann 1987) with Marx’s theory of value. The\nresulting theory of reification as a socially induced pathology has\nnot only had considerable influence on the Frankfurt School (for the\ninfluence of Lukács on Adorno, see Schiller 2011 and\nBraunstein/Duckheim 2015; for the engagement of the later generations\nof Frankfurt School criticism with Lukács see Habermas 1984:\n355–365; Honneth 2008; cf. also Chari 2010, Kavoulakos 2017),\nbut has also lead Lucien Goldmann to speculate that\nHeidegger’s Being and Time is to be read as an answer\nto Lukács (Goldmann 1977). Drawing on reification theory, Lukács sketches a theory of\nsocial rationalization that goes beyond a mere description of economic\nrelations and towards a theory of cultural change. The core of this\nargument is the claim that the dominance of the commodity form in the\neconomic sphere must necessarily lead to the dominance of rational\ncalculation and formal reason in society as a whole. Because a\nbreak with the organic unity and totality of human existence is a\nnecessary precondition for this development, the commodity form must,\nover time, subject all social spheres to its rule. By forcing politics\nand law to adapt to the demands of capitalist exchange, the commodity\nform consequently transforms these spheres into a mode of rational\ncalculability (a line of thought clearly stemming from Weber’s\nanalyses)—which helps explain the rise of the bureaucratic state\nand the dominance of formal, positive law that continues to alienate\nindividuals from society and encourages their passivity in the face of\nobjectified, mechanical rules (1923a: 98). This development leads into a contradictory situation both on the\npractical and the theoretical level: because the process of\nrationalization precludes the grasp of any kind of totality, it cannot\never succeed in making the whole of society subject to rational\ncalculation for it necessarily must exclude all irrational,\nqualitative dimensions from such calculation. As Lukács argues,\nthe inability of economic rationality to integrate qualitative\nfeatures (e.g., of consumption) into a formal system not only\nexplains the economic crises of capitalism but is also reflected in\nthe inability of economic science to explain the movements of the\neconomy (1923a: 105–107). The same holds true for a formalist model of law, which cannot theoretically acknowledge the interdependence of its\nprinciples with their social content and therefore must treat this\ncontent as an extra-legal, irrational foundation (1923a:\n107–110). This analysis of the social and cultural features of reification\nallows Lukács, in a third step, to present an analysis of the\n“antinomies of bourgeois thought” (1923a: 110). In\nattempting to achieve a rational system of principles, modern\nphilosophy is always, Lukács claims, confronted with the issue of\nthere being a “content” necessary for the application of\nits formal principles of knowledge, a content which cannot be\nintegrated into a formal philosophical system—a prime example\nof which is Kant’s “thing in itself” (see Bernstein\n1984: 15–22). Kantian dualism is nothing other than the most\nself-conscious expression of this “hiatus” between subject\n(the source of rational unity) and object (the source of non-rational\ncontent). This dualism between subject and object—and in\nethics, between norms and facts—haunts modern philosophy. As\nFichte and Hegel recognize, this problem arises only because modern\nthought takes the contemplative subject of reified self-world\nrelations as its paradigm, ignoring the alternative of an\nactive subject that is engaged in the production of\nthe content. Fichte’s proposal to postulate an “identical\nsubject-object” (that is, a subject that produces\nobjectivity by positing objective reality as distinct from itself) is\nalso the key to Lukács’ answer. But Fichte’s solution\nstill suffers from an inadequacy in that he conceives of the\nconstitutive activity still as the act of an individual subject\nconfronted with an external, alien reality (1923a: 124). An alternative is to be found in the idealist conception of art as\nan activity directed at the creation of a meaningful totality and in\nSchiller’s view of artistic activity, which is not an\napplication of external, given laws but a form of play (1923a:\n138). However, the conceptualization of practice from the standpoint\nof aesthetics obscures its historical dimension. Lukács\nacknowledges Hegel as the thinker who came nearest to finding a\nsolution to this problem by recognizing that it is the totality of\nconcrete history, understood as the expression of a subject, of a\n“we”, which is the only standpoint from which the\nantinomies between form and content can be overcome (1923a:\n146f.). But Hegel adopts a mythologizing view of this subjectivity in\nterms of a “World Spirit” that lies beyond any concrete\nhistorical agency. The subject Hegel desperately tried to find could\nonly be discovered by Marx—it is the proletariat to which\nLukács assigns the role of the “subject-object” of\nhistory (1923a: 149). The final step in Lukács’ argument is to show that it is\nonly the proletariat that can understand itself as the producer of the\ntotality of society and which is thereby able to overcome\nreification. Initially, both the proletariat and the bourgeoisie face\nthe same immediate reality of an alienated world. Bourgeois thought,\nhowever, endorses this facticity and sees every possible\nnormative stance only as a subjective projection onto a world of\nimmediate facts. In contrast, the proletariat is unable to remain\nwithin bourgeois ideology. Lukács gives two reasons for this\nclaim: in the 1920 essay, titled “Class Consciousness”, he\ndistinguishes between “empirical” and rational,\n“imputed” class consciousness (1920a: 51 and 74) that only\nconstitutes an “objective possibility” given the\ninterests of the proletariat. In contrast, in the\n“Reification” essay, he argues that there is an intrinsic\ndialectics within the class consciousness of the proletariat (Arato\nand Breines 1979: 131–136; for an epistemological reading see\nJameson 2009, 65ff.), arising from its objective position as mere\nobject of the social process. In capitalism, the activity of workers\nis reduced to a completely quantifiable process. But, at the same\ntime, workers cannot have any immediate self-consciousness of their\nwork other than of a qualitatively determined activity. Lukács argues that this\nintrinsic tension in the consciousness of the worker constitutes the\nobjective possibility of the proletariat’s grasping three\nimportant things: first, the proletariat’s own reified existence\nas a product of social mediation, second, the social totality and,\nthird, the proletariat as the subject-object of that totality. However, the process of the proletariat becoming self-conscious\ndoes not only describe a theoretical insight. By realizing that it is\nthe subject-object of history, the proletariat discovers itself to be\nthe subject of the process of social reproduction (see 1923a: 181;\nJay 1984: 107f), not an object of contemplation. As Lukács\nwrites, “The act of consciousness overthrows the objective form\nof its object” (1923a: 178). The proletariat can thus overcome\nreification through a practical engagement with totality—by\nconsciously transforming it into the product of the\nproletariat’s collective action—which this totality\nin its essence has always already been. Of course, this process is, in\nLukács’ mind, nothing other than the communist\nrevolution. As many critics of Lukács have remarked (Adorno 1973:\n190f., Bewes 2002), this seems to commit Lukács to the view that\nthere can be a complete overcoming of reification resulting in a\ntotally transparent society. However, this interpretation ignores\nLukács’ insistence that the resistance against reification\nmust be understood as a never-ending struggle (see 1923a: 199, 206;\nFeenberg 2011; Feenberg 2014: 116). As Lukács’ essay on the “Problem of\nOrganisation” (written shortly before the reification essay)\nshows, the distinction between “empirical” and\n“imputed” class consciousness had not entirely been\nresolved by the introduction of a dialectics of consciousness that is\nsupposed to ground this spontaneous process (1923b). The proletarian\nsituation does not necessarily entail an immediate consciousness of\nthe totality. This consciousness remains only an objective\npossibility, always threatened by the seductions of the immediate\nconsciousness. This makes the agency of the communist party a\nnecessary condition for the revolution. Due to his criticism of\nbureaucracy, Lukács cannot endorse Lenin’s idea of the\ncompletely rationalized organization of the state (Arato and Breines\n1979: 154). In his political writings immediately\npreceding History and Class Consciousness, he rather seems to\n(paradoxically) endorse both a qualified Luxemburgian view of\nproletarian spontaneity (for example in 1920b) and an elitist\nconception of party vanguardism (a “party myth”, Arato and\nBreines 1979: 145). The “unconditional absorption of the total\npersonality in the praxis of the movement”, Lukács writes,\nis “the only possible way of bringing about an authentic\nfreedom” (1923b: 320). It is easy to see that the resulting conception of society that\nLukács articulates owes as much to Hegel as to Marx. This\ninheritance commits Lukács to a number of methodological claims\nwhich put him into stark opposition not only to social democrats like\nBernstein but also, somewhat unintentionally, to the orthodoxy of the\nSoviet party. In his essay “What is Orthodox Marxism?”\n(1919b), Lukács contrasts his method with social democratic\neconomic determinism. He describes Marxism as a purely\nmethodological commitment to Marx’s dialectics rather\nthan as depending on any belief regarding the truth of Marx’s\neconomic theory. Lukács even goes so far as to claim that\n“it is not the primacy of economic motives in historical\nexplanation that constitutes the decisive difference between Marxism\nand bourgeois thought, but the point of view of totality” (1921:\n27). The primacy of the social totality not only affects the Marxist\nmethod, but also the conception of practice and the underlying social\nontology: by insisting on a foundational role of practice in the\nsocial totality, Lukács makes political action rather than labor\ninto the foundation for overcoming reification (Feenberg 1998). In his\n1967 preface to the new edition of History and\nClass-Consciousness, Lukács acknowledges (next to a number\nof exercises in self-criticism, which appear both unjustified and\nexternally motivated) that his insistence on this point meant a\ndeparture from Marx’s concept of practice (1967: xviii), at least\nas interpreted by orthodox Marxists: while Marx had understood\npractice primarily as the conscious engagement of humans with\nnon-human nature, the self-sufficiency of the social for the very\nessence of reality had led Lukács to a different understanding of\npractice which privileges the theoretical and the political (see also\nJay 1984; for a different view Feenberg 2014). Within his social ontology, Lukács is finally committed to the\nclaim that the totality of historical processes, rather than\nindividual facts, are the foundation of objective reality (1923a: 184;\nfor the resulting view of history see Merleau-Ponty 1973), leading him\nto a rejection of all “contemplative” epistemologies (such\nas Lenin’s) which rely on the idea of a simple correspondence\nbetween thoughts and facts (1923a: 199ff; see also Lichtheim 1970:\n62–65; in addition, it follows from the premise that only the\nperspective of the social totality solves the epistemological problems\nof classical philosophy that Lukács must reject Engels’\nclaim that the experimental method is a model for the type of\ndefetishizing praxis that can overcome the subject-object\ndivide, see 1923a: 131–133). This ontology of pure processuality\nfinally entails a normative conception of society that is critical\ntowards all forms of institutional rationalization which are rejected\nas forms of alienation across the board. At the same time, in\ninsisting that the emancipated society must be capable of presenting\nitself as a totality for its subjects, Lukács is unable to\ndiscover any resources for progress in the differentiation of social\nspheres (Arato and Breines 1979: 155). By many of those who were looking for a sophisticated Marxist\nphilosophy, History and Class Consciousness was judged to be\na supremely important book (as for example by Karl Korsch and Ernst\nBloch, see Bloch 1923). The party orthodoxy, however, was not quite so\nenamored. In Germany and Hungary, party intellectuals such as Hermann\nDuncker and Laszlo Rudas disapproved of the book because of its\nidealist tendencies, culminating in its condemnation by Grigory\nZinoviev in his opening address to the June 1924 World Congress of the\nThird International (Arato and Breines 1979: 180). Lukács’\nhastily composed 1924 study about Lenin (see 1924) finally resolved\nthe tension between a Luxemburgian view of revolutionary politics as\nan expression of the spontaneity of the proletariat and a Leninist\nconception of the party as vanguard agent—a tension which\ncharacterizes History and Class Consciousness (see Feenberg\n1988)—in favor of the latter. Thus, already at this point in\ntime, Lukács revises his views in the face of orthodox criticism,\nanticipating a theoretical development towards a more traditional form\nof Marxism to which he subscribes for the remainder of his life (see\nalso the unpublished defense of History and Class\nConsciousness in 1925a and Löwy 2011). While the condemnation of Lukács’ work by party\nintellectuals (and Lukács’ compromising reaction) might\nhave been motivated by political expediency, there were real\nshortcomings in the conception of society and in the conception of\npolitical practice contained in History and Class\nConsciousness: In particular, the idea of the proletariat as the\n“subject-object” of history seemed to entail a Fichtean\nconception of the self-constitutive capacities of the revolutionary\nagent, unlimited by historical circumstances and, correspondingly, of\na self-constitutive form of practice, hostile to any objectivity. This\nconception imports moments that are alien to a Marxist view of history\ninto his theory (even on a non-orthodox reading of Marx). In spite of\nthese objections, in his later work, Lukács remains committed to\nthe idea that understanding society as a totality must be the basis of\nthe social ontology of a non-reductive Marxism. He admits, however,\nthat the notion of totality as the product of a collective subject, as\nhe developed it in 1923, needed to be modified in order to remedy\nthese problems. These problems motivate Lukács’ turn to another model\nof practice—a model of political and social practice which he\nattempts to work out up until the end of his life. While already the\ncritique of Fichteanism in his writings between 1923 and\n1928—for example in his review of an edition of Lasalle’s\nletters (1925b) and in a short piece on Moses Hess\n(1926)—constitutes a significant step towards such a new model,\nit was impossible for him to write anything controversial on\ncontemporary Marxism after the failure of the “Blum\nTheses”. Instead, he tackled the philosophical foundations of\nthese problems in the context of a new reading of the philosophical\ntradition, and especially of Hegel. Already in the reification essay, Lukács describes\nHegel’s philosophy as the only “bourgeois” theory of\nhistory and freedom that comes close to a solution of the problem of\nreification due to its insight that the abyss between subject and\nobject can only be overcome by seeing both as elements within an\nprocess that actively produces the very distinction between\nthem. Thus, Lukács remains committed to the claim that Marx\nsocial theory must be read as a critical completion—rather than\nas a rejection—of Hegel. This means, however, that he must show\nthat the Hegelian idealist metaphysics that Marx rejects does not\nexhaust Hegel’s philosophy. His writings on Hegel, most\nprominently The Young Hegel (1948) and the relevant sections\nin the Ontology of Social Being, can be read as a defense of\nthis commitment. In the former work, Lukács argues that\nHegel’s development of dialectics was informed by his reading of\nthe British economists Steuart and Smith. According to Lukács,\nthis empirical grounding enabled Hegel’s dialectics to draw on\nan idea of objective, social-historical progress and understand modern\nsociety and economy as a processual totality that is structured by\ncontradictions. Hegel’s view of an ontological dialectics must\ntherefore be read as reflecting the structure of objective social\nreality. The resulting “objectivism” allows Hegel to avoid\nthe subjectivist conception of dialectics that (as Lukács\nalleges) Kant and Fichte still subscribed to. Hegel, however,\nsubordinates this objectivist ontology to logic in the course of the\ndevelopment of his system. It is this “logicism”, i.e.,\nthe primacy of categories over being, which leads Hegel to postulate\nthe idealist conception of the “subject-object” which is\nneeded to explain the identity of logical categories and ontological\ndeterminations. This split between a “genuine” dialectics\nwhich reflects the objective contradications of society (even if in an\nidealist manner) and a “logicist” system is the main\nargument in Lukács’ discussion of Hegel in the\nOntology (see GW 13: 489f., 506, 520–523) Hegel’s philosophy also helps Lukács to solve another\nproblem with his own model of praxis developed in History\nand Class Consciousness: the problematic relation between\nobjectivation (Vergegenständlichung),\nexternalization (Entäußerung) and alienation\n(Entfremdung). For Hegel’s idealism, the\nobjectivation of spirit is a necessary but deficient stage of its\ndevelopment that has to be succeeded by a reappropriation of the\nexternalized content (see also 1967: xxiv; 1948: 539–543;\nGW 13: 468–558). This claim directly touches upon the\ntheory of reification: On the one hand, Lukács claims that\nHegel is correct in seeing the products of human labor—and\ntherefore also, indirectly, history—as the result of the\nexternalization of the intentions of individuals, but that he is\nmistaken in describing nature as an objectivation of a (transpersonal)\n“spirit”. On the other hand, Hegel’s theory of\nexternalization as applied to labor also proves to be an advancement\nbeyond Lukács’ earlier thought. Hegel sees\nexternalization (that is, the fact that the objects of our labor and\nthe institutions of society are independent of our consciousness) not\nas a deficiency, but rather as a necessary stage in the development of\nself-consciousness. On this view, the externalization of the social is\nnot problematic in itself. Rather, it is alienation (the\ncauses of which Marx uncovered) that should be the object of the\ncritique of reification (see also Pitkin 1987). This distinction\nentails the possibility of a critique of reification that does not\nrequire a complete reappropriation of objective social forms by a\ncollective subject. Rather, Hegel’s thought suggests a\nconception of political praxis that acknowledges the mutual\ndialectical dependence of subject and object on each other (and thus\navoids a naive instrumentalism in regards to social institutions) and\navoids the reduction of the political totality to the expression of a\nprivileged subject-object (an insight that Feenberg 2014 diagnoses to\nbe already present in History and Class Consciousness). A second, much more problematic set of Lukács’\ncommitments becomes explicit in his writings between the 1930s and the\n1950s. This concerns his conviction that, after Hegel, modern thought\nhas become sharply divided into the two opposing tendencies of Marxist\ndialectics and of bourgeois\n“irrationalism”. Lukács’ view that virtually\nall non-Marxist theorists after Hegel—including Schelling,\nKierkegaard, Nietzsche and Heidegger—can be subsumed under the\nlabel of irrationalism (a blanket term which, depending on the\ncontext, refers to everything from theories of “intellectual\nintuition”, ontological subjectivism, and\n“aristocratic” epistemological positions to the denial of\nprogress in history) is perhaps motivated by an earnest desire to\napply a method of “immanent critique” (see Aronowitz 2011)\nto the developments within philosophy that have facilitated the rise\nof National Socialism. Some of his arguments against Heidegger also\nresemble Adorno’s critique (see also Adorno 1997). But overall,\nthe philosophical arguments for the simplistic distinction between\nprogressive materialism and irrationalism—in particular those\nthat he presents in The Destruction of Reason (according to\nGeorge Lichtheim “the worst book he ever wrote”, Lichtheim\n1970: 68)—are dogmatic and superficial. A number of particularly\nproblematic claims are made in the postscript to\nthe Destruction where Lukács not only defends the\nSoviet Union under Stalin, but also accuses Bertrand Russell of being\nsecretly religious (1954: 808) and characterizes Wittgenstein and the\npragmatists as proponents of a form of subjectivism that facilitates\nthe rise of a new fascism (1954: 782ff.; for other examples, see the\nunpublished 1933a). The most fundamental level on which Lukács develops his\nrevised model of Hegelian Marxism is one of ontology, or, more\nspecifically, of an “ontology of social being”. This\nontology is intended, at least outwardly, to be a faithful\ninterpretation of the ontological implications of Marxism. However,\nthe way in which Lukács develops these ontological\nfoundations—as well as his extended and sympathetic discussion\nof Nicolai Hartmann—betrays the way in which they function to\nsupport his own, Hegelian Marxism against dogmatic Historical\nMaterialism (although, as Heller 1983 notes, not without a number of\nunsolved contradictions). In terms of a general ontology, Lukács claims that we can\ndistinguish three levels of being in the world: material or inorganic\nbeing, organic life and social reality (GW 13: 22). All three\nlevels are distinguished by a division between the genuine essence of\nentities and their appearance. While on all three levels,\nentities appear as fixed objects, their real essence is always\nthat of interrelated, irreversible processes (GW 13:\n240). This entails that the basic form of all being is\ntemporality and historicity (GW 13: 228). Lukács claims\nthat his position on this point takes up insights from Hegel, while avoiding\nthe “logicism” of his ontology and his teleological\nmetaphysics, allowing only for causal, not teleological determinations\nof these processes in the inorganic and organic case. While his general ontology remains rather underdeveloped and is not\ninformed by much knowledge of concurrent philosophical developments\n(apart from the mentioned discussion of Hartmann), Lukács’\ntheory of social reality has more contemporary relevance. Social\nreality, Lukács claims, differs from the other levels of\nreality insofar as it is, in contrast to them, not only governed by\ncausal, non-teleological laws. Social reality also contains an element\nof teleology as a result of “teleological\npositing” (GW 13: 20; 1971c: 12ff.). Due to their\nability to perform labor, humans can “posit” functions or\ngoals that are to govern the natural, causal processes that they\nmanipulate. By choosing one of the potential results of the employment\nof their natural and technological capacities as the correct one,\nindividuals can create a distinction between successful and\nunsuccessful execution of their intended actions in labor. This,\nLukács’ argues, introduces normative distinctions or values\ninto the world (see 1971b: 75f and 153–156; 1968: 140). This not\nonly explains “use value” in the sense of economic\nutility, but—because the economic development of society over\ntime necessarily produces forms of social reality which are\nindependent from the economy—Historical Materialism can also\nallow for forms of socially instituted value that are irreducible to\nutility (1971b: 153). In particular, Lukács claims that the\nobjectification of human intentions in institutions enables us to\nunderstand the existence of objective values as products of\nsocial-historical developments without sliding into historical\nrelativism. However, as some of his own students notice, this\nexplanation remains too unclear to solve the problem of normativity\nfor Marxism (see Fehér et al., 1983). The same doubts remain in regard\nto Lukács’ further claim that there is one fundamental,\nimmanent value of social history, namely the unfettered development of\nhuman capacities (GW 14: 153). Because Lukács sees the process of labor as the foundation of\nall social and normative phenomena (see also 1971c: 65; Thompson\n2011), the totality of society can be described as the totality of all\nrelations between the teleological acts of “positing”\nconditions of success in labor. Even though Lukács acknowledges\nintentional consciousness as an irreducible factor in these acts (see\nLukács 1968: 138), they are still determined by the objective,\nhistorical development of social relations both in terms of the human\ndesires that drive them, in terms of the systemic interdependence of\ntheir unintended consequences and in terms of the technological\nfeasibility of their results. Consequently, over time, the social\nbecomes more and more determined by its own history, rather than by\nnature alone (1971b: 75). Nevertheless, the positing of teleology is\nnever completely causally determined by society because it\nalways involves an individual’s choice between alternative\ngoals. Thus, the very structure of labor is, Lukács claims, the\nbasis of individual freedom and the basis of individual personality\n(character being the continual process of choosing between\nalternatives and forming oneself thereby, see GW 13:\n62ff). From these ontological commitments, it follows that the existence\nof the social totality depends on the intentionality which guides\nindividual acts of labor and vice versa (see Tertullian\n1988). Lukács therefore describes social phenomena—as\nlanguage and institutions—as modifications and\n“mediations” of the relations of the labor process. That\nis, they are media of “indirect” teleological positing\nbecause they enable forms of action which do not directly modify\nnature but which indirectly aspire to bring other persons to do so\n(GW 14: 172; 1968: 142). Even though he remains committed to\nthe primacy of labor, Lukács allows for these linguistic and\ninstitutional mediations to acquire a dynamic of their own over time,\nbecoming independent of the goal of dominating nature, in particular\nbecause they allow for a generalization of the cognitive grasp of\nparticular phenomena (see GW 13: 47; GW 14: 165ff,\n342–357) and an increase of distance between subject and objects\n(1971c: 100). This understanding of institutions entails that\npolitics, as a form of action directed towards the social totality as\na whole, must treat this totality, on the one hand, as being dependent\non natural and biological facts that limit its potential\ntransformations and, on the other hand, as increasingly being\ndetermined by laws of its own (GW 14: 432). Lukács’ conception of individuality as a product of the\nchoice between alternatives within a socially determined totality\nfinally leads to a theory of alienation that partially\nreplaces the theory of reification of the younger Lukács. Whereas\nthe latter theory was closely connected to a theory of collective\nreappropriation of society, Lukács describes alienation in the\nOntology as primarily the result of social conditions that\nmake individuals into merely “particular”\npersonalities (GW 14: 530), instead of allowing them to\ndevelop their capacities to the degree that the present development of\nproductive forces could make possible. This means that alienation (for\ninstance, the alienation brought about by excessive professional\nspecialization) must be understood as the socially induced incapacity\nof individuals to participate in the “species being” or\nthe social totality. The overcoming of alienation thus always\ndemands—along with social changes—subjective\ntransformation, i.e., individual change (GW 14:\n551). This finally points towards the ethical dimension of\nthe Ontology. Lukács claims that there is a normative\nideal immanent in society as such, namely, the ideal of social\nrelations that allow all persons to fully participate in the social\ntotality with their whole personality and thereby realizing their\nuniversal nature. Compared with\nHistory and Class Consciousness, the normative ideal of\nthe Ontology points to a radically different conception of\npolitical action. In the Ontology, it is not the\nself-realization of the collective subject-object in history that is\nthe defining moment of revolutionary politics, but rather the gradual\nrealization of the universal nature of humans in their interaction\nwith society and nature. This suggests a conception of political\npraxis which amounts to a form of humanist, democratic\ncommunism and which respects the insight that Lukács had derived\nfrom his re-interpretation of Hegel’s philosophy: politics must\nbe understood as a collective coming to terms with a dialectics\nbetween subjective and objective elements within a social totality\nrather than as the becoming conscious of the identical subject-object\nof history. While Lukács only makes his ontological commitments explicit\ntowards the end of his life, they inform the development of his\naesthetics from the 1930s on. From the general materialist premises of\nhis ontology and from his rejection of the epistemology of History\nand Class Consciousness in favor of the Leninist alternative (see\n1938), it follows that cultural and mental phenomena must always be\nseen as reflections (or “mirroring”,\nWiderspiegelungen) of an objective reality (GW\n11: 22, 55). Like science and ethics, art breaks with the immediacy of our\neveryday practical engagements that dominates the more common forms of\nreflection (GW 11: 207, 214). Aesthetic reflections of\nreality, however, differ from science (or, more generally, from\nconceptual and theoretical reflections) in three regards: First, while\nscientific knowledge presupposes a\n“deanthropomorphization” of the subject matter (meaning\nthat reality is presented as independent from human desires or\nsubjectivity), aesthetic subject matter remains anthropomorphized as\nfar as art presents reality in the form of inner experience. Thus,\naesthetic representation always remains connected to a possible\n“evocation” of reactions of a human subject (GW\n11: 438). Second, while science is always conceptually mediated, art\nbreaks with the immediacy of everyday life in favor of a new immediacy\nof experience (GW 11: 237, 509, 513). And third, while\nscience reflects reality in the form of general laws, aesthetic\nrepresentation is always bound to represent universal aspects of the\nessence of reality in the form of the individuality (or specificity)\nof the work of art (Lukács’ term for individuality is\nBesonderheit, a concept which he takes up from\nHegel’s Science of Logic where it describes the\ndialectical sublation of both generality and particularity within the\n“notion”). According to this conception of art as a mode of reflection, the\nfunction of a work of art is to present humans with the totality of\nthe objective, historical reality within an “homogeneous\nmedium” (such as pure visibility in painting or poetic language\nin poetry, see GW 11: 642). The employment of such a medium\nmakes it possible for art to single out and represent the universal\naspects of a given form of human reality as a “closed\nworld-in-itself” or as an “intensive totality”\n(GW 11: 238, 461, 774; GW 12: 232). As Lukács\nargues (GW 11: 660), the medium of each specific form of art\nestablishes strict laws that allow the work of art to adequately\npresent the whole world of humanity from a specific standpoint. For\nthis reason, such works of art allow us to comprehend the universal\naspects of our existence and to consciously participate in the\ncollective life of humanity (GW 11: 519–530). This\neffect of art Lukács describes as “defetishization”\n(GW 11: ch. 9), anticipating the ethical demand of\novercoming alienation that he formulates in the Ontology. A\nsuccessful work of art can thus have the effect of\n“catharsis” (GW 11: 811), transforming the\n“whole person” of everyday life (the person who is\nentangled in their diverse relationships) into a “person as a\nwhole” (the person who realizes their humanity by acquiring a\nsense of self-consciousness regarding the richness of human relations\nthat constitute the historical development of humankind). Even though they represent objective reality, works of art are, in\nvirtue of this mode of reflection, subject-dependent because their\ncharacter is constituted by their capacity to evoke a subjective\nreaction: i.e., an understanding of how the world that is revealed\nin art is appropriate for the comprehending subject in its universal\nnature (GW 11: 305). This reaction is not only one of passive\nacknowledgment; it also actively transforms the subject by\nfacilitating a consciousness of that very universal nature. Thus, in\nthe work of art, subjectivity and objectivity are mutually\nconstitutive for each other. In a transformed sense—as\nLukács explicitly acknowledges (GW 11: 582; GW\n12: 217)—the subject-object of idealism is an appropriate\nconcept for works of art (which, as one might add, therefore fulfills\nLukács’ aspirations for the socialist revolution that he\nhad to renounce both politically and philosophically). Of course, in\nthis new sense, the term “subject-object” no longer\nsignifies a privileged agent becoming self-conscious, but only the\ninterdependence of subjectivity and objectivity in a specific sphere\nof experience. Lukács makes a similar conceptual move by endorsing the\nclaim that all consciousness is a reflection of reality. On the one\nhand, this signals a revision of the epistemological position he had\ndefended in History and Class Consciousness (where he had\ncriticized the distinction between a seemingly objective reality and\npurely subjective forms of perception) in favor of Lenin’s\ntheory of consciousness. On the other hand, Lukács is keen to\npreserve—at least within the boundaries of the\naesthetic—room for the idea that some insights can be had only\nin relation to a totality that encompasses subjectivity and\nobjectivity. Lukács no longer derives his aesthetic commitments at this\npoint from purely philosophical premises—as he did in his\nHeidelberg writings—but rather builds on anthropological\npremises (especially concerning the concept of everyday life, in\nregard to which he notes the similarity between his analysis and\nHeidegger’s notion of practical engagement, see GW 11:\n68–71, for related points on the Ontology see Joós\n1982), psychological theorizing (proposing an extension of\nPavlov’s behaviorist classification of signal systems, see\nGW 12: 11–191) and a speculative notion of world\nhistory. The most important concept binding these premises together is\nthe idea of mimesis. Mimetic behavior, Lukács argues, is\na fundamental way of human coping with the world and the source of\nboth magic and art. Through the mimetic imitation of natural\nprocesses, humans acquire the ability to represent the salient aspects\nof the world in a closed and totalizing manner, and they gradually\nlearn to separate such imitations from the necessity of immediate\nreaction. In contrast to magic which does not separate reflection and\nobjective causation, mimesis in art is consciously taken as a\nreflection and evokes the aesthetic effect in its audience\nspecifically in virtue of this feature (GW 11: 382). In other\nwords, while both art and science overcome the superstition of magic,\nonly art can retain the mimetic dimension of representation. Lukács’ commitment to a conception of the work of art as\na closed totality, structured by the strict laws of its medium and\nobjectively reflecting the development of humanity in the mode of\nmimetic evocation, has considerable implications for his own judgments\nas an aesthetic theorist. His writings on literary realism that he\npublished from the 1930s to the 1950s—especially\n“Realism in the Balance” (1938), The Historical\nNovel (1955), and The Meaning of Contemporary Realism\n(1955)—display to various degrees a mixture of philosophical\ninsight and Stalinist orthodoxy. In any case, they are animated by\nstrong commitment to the superiority of realism, as exemplified by\nBalzac, Tolstoy, Gorky (see GW 5) and Thomas Mann (see 1949),\nthat he contrasts to the “decadent” avant-garde literature\nof his times. This position of his drew sharp criticism, for example\nfrom Seghers, Brecht and Adorno (see Lukács 1981; Brecht 1977;\nAdorno 1972; for the Lukács-Brecht debate see Pike 1985). However, as far as Lukács’ commitment to realism\nreflects the demand that works of art should present a totality of\nmeaning that is not alien to the life of individuals, but rather\novercomes the alienation they suffer from in everyday life, it\nexpresses (even in its most distorted versions) an intuition that\nsustains Lukács’ work from the beginning: the desire for an\novercoming of the tension between human life and the objective social\nforms that constitute modern society. At various points in his life, Lukács had rejected the\npessimism of his youth. First, he had endorsed an optimism concerning\nthe capacity of the proletariat to constitute such a totality in\nsociety through a revolutionary overcoming of reification; later on,\nthis optimism was modified to encompass the ever increasing human\ncapacities to become self-conscious of their universal character\nthrough a reflection of the existing social totality in the totality\nof the work of art. Thus, even at his most conservative moments as a\nproponent of Socialist Realism, Lukács is motivated by a keen\nintuition concerning the tragic consequences of this aspect of modern\nculture and, as the constant revisions of his position show, by a\nsensitivity to the inappropriateness of all conceptions of the human\ncondition which do not appropriately deal with this problem.","contact.mail":"titus.stahl@rug.nl","contact.domain":"rug.nl"}]
