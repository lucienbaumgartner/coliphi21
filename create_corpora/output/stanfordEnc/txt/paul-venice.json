His philosophical theories (culminating in a metaphysics of\nessences which states the ontological and epistemological primacy of\nuniversals over any other kind of beings) are the final and highest\nresult of the preceding realistic tradition of thought. He fully\ndeveloped the new form of realism started up by Wyclif and his Oxonian\nfollowers in the last decades of the 14th century, and\nrenewed Burley’s attacks against nominalistic views. The metaphysical\nconvictions at the basis of his philosophy are an original version of\nthe most fundamental theses of Duns Scotus (viz. univocity of being;\nexistence of universal forms outside the mind, which are at the same\ntime identical with and different from their own individuals; real\nidentity and formal distinction between essence and being; thisness as\nthe principle of individuation; real distinction among the ten\ncategories). But Paul puts much more stress on the ontological\npresuppositions and entailments of the doctrine. Simultaneously, he\nwas open to influences from many other directions, as he held in due\nconsideration also the positions of authors such as Albert the Great,\nThomas Aquinas, and Giles of Rome, and critically discussed the\ndoctrines of the main Nominalists of the 14th century,\nnamely William Ockham, John Buridan, and Marsilius of Inghen,\nsometimes playing mutually incompatible theses against each other.\nThis contributes to making his works stimulating and enriching from an\nhistorical point of view, but also makes it difficult to grasp his own\nideas in their relationships and unity. These reflections help us to\nexplain why for about one hundred and fifty years Paul was\nerroneously, but unanimously, believed to be an Ockhamist in\nlogic and metaphysics and an Averroist in psychology and\nepistemology.\n\nPaul of Venice (Paulus Nicolettus Venetus, Paolo Nicoletti Veneto),\nO.E.S.A. was born in Udine, Italy, around 1369. He joined the\nAugustinian order near the age of fourteen, when he entered the\nconvent of Santo Stefano in Venice. He studied first at Padua, but in\n1390 he was assigned to Oxford, where he spent three years. He became\nDoctor of Arts and Theology by 1405. He taught in Padua, Siena\n(1420–24), and Perugia (1424–28), and lectured in Bologna\n(1424). At various times he held positions of leadership in his order\n(Pope Gregory XII designated him Prior General of the Augustinians in\nMay 1409) and served as ambassador of the Venetian Republic. He died\nin Padua on 15 June 1429, while commenting the De anima\n(On the Soul) of Aristotle. \nPaul wrote many philosophical and theological treatises (the complete\nlist of his writings and a guide to extant manuscripts are in Perreiah\n1986; for the dating of his main philosophical works see Conti 1996,\npp. 9–20), including: Logica parva (The Small\nLogic), ca. 1393–95; Logica magna (The Great\nLogic—LM), ca. 1396–99; Sophismata aurea\n(Golden Sophisms), ca. 1399; a commentary on Aristotle’s\nPosterior Analytics (In Post.), C.E. 1406; Summa\nphilosophiae naturalis (Summa of Natural\nPhilosophy—SN), C.E. 1408; a commentary on\nAristotle’s Physics (In Phys.), C.E. 1409; a\ncommentary on Aristotle’s On the Soul (In De anima),\nca. 1415–20; Quaestio de universalibus (On\nUniversals—QdU), ca. 1420–24; a commentary\non Aristotle’s Metaphysics (In Metaph.), ca.\n1420–24; a commentary on the Ars Vetus, that is, on\nPorphyry’s Isagoge, Aristotle’s Categories, and the\nLiber sex principiorum (Expositio super Universalia\nPorphyrii et Artem Veterem Aristotelis—In Porph.,\nIn Cat., and In Sex pr. respectively), C.E.\n1428. \nThe main contributions of Paul of Venice to the history of logic in\nthe Middle Ages concern the notion of formal distinction and the\nanalysis of predication. \nPaul’s formulation of the theory of identity and distinction is a\nfurther development of Duns Scotus’ and Wyclif’s doctrines on the\nsubject. The Italian master recognizes two main types of identity:\nmaterial (secundum materiam) and formal (secundum\nformam). There is material identity when the material cause is\nthe same, either in number (it is a case of the same thing called in\ndifferent ways) or by species (it is a case of two objects made of the\nsame kind of stuff). There is formal identity when the formal cause is\nthe same. This happens in two ways: if the form at issue is the\nsingular form of the individual composite, then there is a unique\nobject known in different ways; if the form at issue is the common\nessence instantiated by the singular form, then there are two distinct\nobjects belonging to the same species or genus (In Metaph.,\nbook V, tr. 2, chap. 3, fol. 185ra). Correspondingly, the main types\nof distinction (or difference) are also two: material and formal.\nThere is material distinction when the material cause is different, so\nthat the objects at issue are separable entities. In general, there is\nformal distinction when the formal cause is different. This happens in\ntwo ways: if the material cause is also different, then it is a\nparticular case of material distinction. If the material cause is the\nsame, then a further analysis is necessary. If the material cause is\nthe same by species only, then it is an improper case of formal\ndistinction; but if the material cause is the same in number, then\nthere is properly formal distinction, since the forms at issue have\ndifferent definite descriptions but share the same substrate of\nexistence, so that they are one and the same thing in reality. For\nexample, there is a proper formal distinction in the case of the two\nproperties of being-capable-of-laughing (risibile) and of\nbeing-capable-of-learning (disciplinabile), which are\nconnected forms instantiated by the same set of individual substances\n(In Metaph., book V, tr. 2, chap. 3, fol. 185rb). \nMaterial distinction is a necessary and sufficient criterion for real\ndifference, traditionally conceived, whereas there is formal\ndistinction if and only if there is one substance in number (i.e.\nmaterial identity in the strict sense) and a multiplicity of formal\nprinciples with different descriptions instantiated by it. Paul\ntherefore inverts the terms of the question in relation to what\nearlier approaches had done. By means of the formal distinction Duns\nScotus and John Wyclif had tried to explain how it is possible to\ndistinguish many different real aspects internal to the same\nindividual substance (the passage is from one to many). On the\ncontrary, Paul is attempting to reduce multiplicity to unity (the\npassage is from many to one). What Paul wants to account for is the\nway in which many different entities of a certain kind (i.e. of an\nincomplete and dependent mode of existence) can constitute one and the\nsame substance in number. \nThe starting point of Paul’s theory of predication is his doctrine of\nuniversals. Just like Wyclif and his followers (Alyngton, Penbygull,\nSharpe, Milverley, Whelpdale, Tarteys), the Augustinian master claims\nthat \nBut his analysis of predication is different from those of both Wyclif\nand his followers. In fact, Paul divides predication into identical\npredication and formal predication and defines them in a different way\nthan his sources do. \nTo speak of identical predication it is sufficient that the\nform signified by the subject-term of a (true) proposition and the\nform signified by the predicate-term share at least one of their\nsubstrates of existence. This is the case for propositions like\n‘Man is (an) animal’ and ‘The universal-man is\nsomething white’ (‘Homo in communi est\nalbum’). One speaks of formal predication in two\ncases: \nAs is evident, identical predication is extensionally defined, whereas\nformal predication is intensionally defined, since formal predication\nentails a relation modally determined between the subject-thing and\nthe predicate-thing. In fact, formal predication presupposes that\nthere is a necessary connection between the subject-thing and\nthe predicate-thing of the given proposition. For this reason, Paul\ndenies that sentences like ‘(What is) singular is (what is)\nuniversal’ (‘Singulare est universale’),\nwhich Wyclif and his followers acknowledged as true, are in fact true\npropositions. For Wyclif and his followers, the sentence at issue is\nan example of predication by essence. But for Paul of Venice, it is an\nexample of formal predication; no individual qua individual\nis a universal, or vice versa, as no second intention\nintensionally considered is any other second intention (QdU,\nfol. 133va; In Porph., prooem., fol. 3ra–b).\nAs a consequence, Paul rewrites the preceding sentence in this form:\n‘(What is) singular is this universal’\n(‘Singulare est hoc universale’), where the\npresence of the demonstrative ‘this’ changes the kind of\npredication from formal to identical. So corrected, the sentence is\ntrue, since it signifies that a certain entity, in itself singular, is\nthe substrate of existence of a universal essence (QdU, fol.\n133va–b). \nAs a result, Paul builds up a mixed system, where the copula of the\nstandard philosophical sentences he deals with can have a threefold\nvalue: it means a partial identity between the subject-thing and the\npredicate-thing in the case of identical predication; it means a\nnecessary link between forms in the case of the first type of formal\npredication; it means that the subject-thing in virtue of itself is\nnecessarily a member of a given class of objects, which the\npredicate-term of the proposition labels and refers to, in the case of\nthe second type of formal predication—that is, when the\npredicate is a term of second intention. \nPaul of Venice deals with the problem of the meaning and truth of\nsentences in his Logica Magna and in his commentaries on the\nMetaphysics and on the Categories. His theory is\nsubstantially the same in all these works, but in the two commentaries\nhe stresses the ontological implications of his semantic choices\nslightly more, and modifies his solution of the question of the\nmeaning of a true negative sentence. Paul’s purpose is twofold. He\nintends (1) to determine the ontological status and nature of the\ncomplexe significabile more precisely; and (2) to develop a\ngeneral theory of the proposition which would be logically more\nrigorous and less compromised by a metaphysics of the possible than\nthat supported by Gregory of Rimini, his main source on that subject.\nFor this reason Paul deals with the question of the truth and falsity\nof a proposition before examining the problem of its meaning, and\nsolves the latter on the basis of the answer to the former, thus\ninverting the order followed by Gregory. \nAs a sign of special respect, Gregory of Rimini is the only author\ncited by name in the two treatises of Paul’s Logica Magna\ndevoted to the questions of the meaning and truth of a sentence.\nPaul’s critique is nevertheless all-embracing. He lists thirteen\narguments against Gregory’s theses: six are philosophical and seven\ntheological (LM, II, tr. 11, pp. 96–104). We can focus\non the most important ones, as they help us to better understand\nPaul’s final choices on the matter. \nThe main philosophical arguments concern Gregory’s theory of the\nlevels of being. As is well known, the aim of Gregory’s theory of\ncomplexe significabile seems to be to identify and describe\nan objective and independent molecular entity existing in re,\nwhich can be the significatum or the referent of a sentence,\nand therefore guarantees the success of our effort to understand the\nworld. According to Gregory, this entity is the complexe\nsignificabile, that is something (1) complex but one in number,\nwhich cannot be identified with the things that the subject and/or the\npredicate of the sentence signify; (2) real but distinct from the\nextramental categorial items as well as from their corresponding\nmental signs; and (3) the proper and adequate object of a possible act\nof signification (see the prologue of his commentary on the first book\nof Sentences, q. 1, a. 1, pp. 3–4). It is precisely in\norder to provide the complexe significabile with a suitable\nontological status, and every sentence with a significatum that\nGregory elaborates a theory of the levels of being. According to it,\nthe world is constituted by (1) the categorial items (or atomic\nobjects) which are the ground of existence of every other being; (2)\nthe states of affairs connected to them; and (3) the possible states\nof affairs that the atomic objects could cause if they were combined\nin a different way from the actual one. In fact, Gregory claims that\nthe terms ‘something’ (‘aliquid’),\n‘thing’ (‘res’), and\n‘being’ (‘ens’) are synonyms, and\nthat they have a threefold meaning. They can be taken (1) for anything\nsignifiable in any way (that is, by a simple or a complex expression,\ntruly or falsely)—this would be the sense in which Aristotle in\nthe chapter de priori of his Categories says that it\nis necessary that an expression is called true or false when a thing\nis or is not. (2) For anything signifiable by a simple or a complex\nexpression, but truly. And (3) for an existing essence or entity\n(ibidem, pp. 8–9). This distinction implies that (1)\nthe complexe significabilia are not real in the same sense as\nthe entia praedicamentalia are; (2) the complexe\nsignificabilia designated by false sentences have a feebler\nreality than those designated by true sentences, but they are\nnevertheless real and constitutive elements of the world; and (3) the\nreality of complexe significabilia (both true and false) is\ndifferent from that of the categorial items on which this reality is\ngrounded. \nPaul denies (1) that states of affairs, both actual and possible, are\nconstitutive parts of the world really distinct from the categorial\nitems, and (2) that whatever is signifiable by a complex expression is\na thing. In fact, according to Paul, the term ‘something’,\ntaken in the first or second sense enumerated by Gregory, is a\ntranscendental term, and as a consequence it immediately signifies all\npossible substances and accidents in just the same way. Therefore, if\nbeing a man (hominem esse) were something, in the first or\nsecond sense of the term ‘something’, then being a man\nwould be a substance or an accident, and so something in the third\nsense of the term—that is, an atomic object (or categorial\nitem). If the supporters of Gregory’s opinion were to claim that\n‘something’ is not a transcendental term—remarks\nPaul—, it would follow that ‘something’ would be\neither less general than a transcendental term or more general. In the\nfirst case, the logical consequence is that the term\n‘something’ signifies a categorial item, and thus it still\nfollows that if being a man is something in the first or second way,\nit is something in the third way. In the second case, it follows that\n‘something’ is more general than ‘being’, and\ntherefore that the following inference is invalid: \n«if being a man is something, then being a man is», \na consequence which is the opposite of what Gregory intended to hold\n(LM, II, tr. 11, pp. 96–98). \nThe second main philosophical argument against Gregory’s theory is\nmeant to show that what is signified by a sentence (or complex\nexpression) cannot be qualified as a thing. Paul explicitly denies\nthat, according to Aristotle, whatever is signifiable by a complex is\na thing (ibidem, p. 104). \nFrom a theological point of view, the main inconvenience arising from\nGregory’s opinion is that there would be many eternal things none of\nwhich is God—a thesis condemned at Paris in 1277. In\nfact—argues Paul—this complexe significabile,\nthat God is, is a thing different from God Himself, according to\nGregory, and it is from eternity (ibidem, p. 100). \nIn sum, Paul agrees with Gregory that what is signified by a simple\nexpression is different from what is signified by a complex\nexpression, and that what is signified by a complex expression is also\nreal, but disagrees with him about the meaning of the term\n‘res’. In his view, only positive beings are\nthings, and what is signified by a complex expression is not a\npositive being, as it is not an item in one of the ten categorial\nlines. In other words, according to Paul, even though states of\naffairs are not really, but only formally, different from individual\nthings, they cannot in any way be regarded as things in the world. \nAs a consequence, the chief feature of Paul’s theory of the\ncomplexe significabile is his claim that the adequate\nsignificate of a proposition is really identical-to and somehow (and\nmore precisely, formally) distinct-from what is signifiable by the\nsubject-term and/or the predicate-term alone (ibidem, p.\n156). All the other theses derive from this, which is the cornerstone\nof his theory of the proposition. \nPaul defines the propositio as a well formed (congrua) and\ncomplete (perfecta) mental sentence, which signifies the true\nor the false (LM, pars II, tractatus de\npropositione, fol. 101rb–va), and sums up his position on\nthe problem of truth and falsity in four points: \nThe obvious consequence of these rules is that, with the sole\nexception of insolubilia, which are called false not because\nthey signify the false, but because they affirm themselves to be false\nor not to be true, all the other kinds of proposition are true if and\nonly if what they signify is true, and false if and only if what they\nsignify is false (ibidem, p. 64). \nIn his commentary on the Categories, Paul explains that the\ndirect and adequate objects of propositions, which make them true, are\nmolecular things (res complexae) existing outside the soul.\nSuch entities are complexe significabilia, the\nsignificata of propositions, that is extramental realities\nmade up of a subject-form and a predicate-form linked together in one\nand the same substance or set of substances (In Cat., cap.\nde subiecto et praedicato, fol. 48ra). Thus, Paul’s approach\nto the question of the truth of a proposition is ontological, as is\nGregory’s, since according to him the true is an attribute of things\nand only secondarily of thought, but at the same time it is consistent\nwith the fundamental principle of every form of correspondence theory\nof truth, that of the isomorphism of language, thought, and the world.\nIn fact, in his commentary on the Metaphysics Paul\ndistinguishes three different but connected kinds of truth: truth of\nimitation (veritas imitationis), truth of disclosure\n(veritas manifestationis), and relational truth (veritas\nrespectiva). The first type of truth is the measure of the\nconformity (adaequatio) which all the things have in relation\nto their corresponding ideas in the mind of God, from which they\nderive. The second type is also a real property of extramental things,\nwhich measures their various degrees of disposition to be apprehended\nby our intellect. Relational truth, unlike the first two\nveritates, is not an absolute property of things, but, just\nas its name suggests, a relation, and more precisely a relation of\nconformity which has its substrate of existence in our intellect, its\nfundamentum in mental sentences, and its terminus ad\nquem in the molecular objects existing outside the soul. Despite\nthe fact that it is related to the activity of the intellect, the\nveritas respectiva is the effect caused in our intellect by\nthe existence of the veritas manifestationis. If things were\nnot intelligible by themselves, they could not be grasped and\nrecognised by our intellect for what they are (In Metaph.,\nlib. VI, cap. 4, fol. 233rb–va). So, like Gregory, Paul also\nsupports the idea that human knowledge is true only qua\nknowledge of the ontological truth, and that sentences are true only\nin so far as they are signs of the ontological truth. \nOn the basis of this account, what then is the relationship that holds\nbetween atomic objects (the incomplexa or categorial items)\nand molecular objects (or complexa or complexe\nsignificabilia)? And what is (if anything is) the significate of\na false proposition? Paul answers these questions in the Logica\nMagna and in the commentary on the Categories. His\nconception undergoes a certain development: in the Logica\nMagna he denies that what is signified by a true negative\nproposition is something real, since it is neither an atomic being,\nnor an aggregate, nor a molecular being (II, tr. 11, p. 122). In the\ncommentary on the Categories he modifies his opinion on this\nsubject, since he admits that there are in re a kind of\nnegative state of affairs signified by true negative propositions.\nMoreover, he now identifies the significate of any false sentence with\na second mental proposition existing obiective and not\nsubiective in our intellect. \nThe thesis of the Logica Magna that what is signified by a\ntrue negative proposition is not something real was not consistent\nwith the universal principle adopted by Paul in this context: a\nsentence is true if and only if it is a signum veri, nor with\nwhat he affirms about the reality of what is signified by a true\naffirmative sentence, which he identifies with the molecular truth\nwhich derives from the veritas manifestationis proper to the\natomic beings, and which is at the same time really identical-with and\nformally distinct-from them (ibidem, pp. 156 and 166). \nIt is clear that if he was not also able to give a form of reality to\nthe significata of true negative sentences, they could not be\nconsidered true, but, paradoxically, would be false, because they\nwould be without any referent in reality. For this reason in the\ncommentary on the Categories Paul distinguishes between the\nsignificate of a true sentence and the significate of a false\nsentence. Paul persists in thinking that if there is no adequate\nsignificatum in the world, that is, if there is not something\ncomplex to which the mental proposition refers in extramental reality,\nthen the uttered sentence and the mental proposition are false, but he\nnow accepts Burley’s idea that there are two different kinds of mental\nexpressions, those which exist subiective in the intellect,\nas its acts of understanding, and those which exist obiective\nin it, as the direct objects of those acts of understanding. According\nto Paul, the mental proposition existing obiective in our\nintellect is the significatum ultimum et adaequatum of false\npropositions (In Cat., cap. de priori, fol.\n136vb). \nAs far as true propositions, both affirmative and negative, are\nconcerned, the case is different. In Paul’s opinion, a true\naffirmative proposition signifies a molecular truth, that is a complex\nreality which is part of the whole reality (the esse reale of\nthe Summa philosophiae naturalis—see below) of a finite\ncorporeal being. So, like Gregory, Paul denies that what verifies the\nproposition ‘Socrates is white’ is Socrates and the\naccidental form of whiteness taken together. On the contrary, he\nclaims that the significatum adaequatum of that proposition\nis the whole reality of Socrates or his being white (LM, II,\ntr. 11, p. 170). In fact, if the realities signified by true\npropositions were aggregates made up of the two entities signified by\nthe subject-term and the predicate-term, then these two propositions,\n‘the sun heats the house’ and ‘the house is heated\nby the sun’, would be interchangeable not only with respect to\ntheir reference, but also wth respect to their significates, because\nwhat verifies both of them would be the existence of the sun, the\nhouse, and the action of heating. But according to Paul, the two\npropositions are only extensionally equivalent, and intensionally\ndifferent, because of their own different significata\n(ibidem). ‘The sun heats the house’ signifies a\nstate (of affairs) connected with the being of the sun, but ‘the\nhouse is heated by the sun’ signifies a state (of affairs)\nconnected with the being of the house. Thus it is incorrect that,\naccording to Paul, the significate with which the adequate significate\nof a proposition can be in fact identified is the one thing that, by\nbeing in a certain state, renders the proposition true. It is quite\nthe opposite: a certain state of the thing signified by the subject of\nthe sentence is the adequate significate of that same sentence. Paul\nmaintains (1) that the adequate significate of a proposition is,\nimplicitly or explicitly, determined by the composition of its parts,\nand (2) that it is impossible for the adequate significate of a simple\nexpression (a term) to be the adequate significate of a complex\nexpression (a proposition), since otherwise, an absolutely simple term\nwould adequately signify the true or the false—an evident\nabsurdity (LM, II, tr. 11, p. 196). So, in order to be\nconsistent with these claims, in the commentary on the\nCategories Paul states that true negative propositions too\nhave something complex which corresponds to them in reality, a sort of\nnegative state of affairs grounded (1) in the two esse realia\nproper to the things signified by the subject and predicate-terms, or\n(2) in the laws which rule the order and the metaphysical structure of\nthe world (In Cat., cap. de substantia, fol.\n66ra). \nPaul’s world consists of finite beings (that is, things like men or\nhorses) really existing outside the mind, each made up of a primary\nsubstance and a host of forms existing in it and by it. The forms of a\nprimary substance belong to ten different types of being, or\ncategories. Therefore a finite being cannot be totally identified with\nthe primary substance. (In fact no primary substance contains the\nwhole being of a finite being.) Rather it is an ordered congeries of\ncategorial items. Primary substances are not simple items but complex\nobjects, since they are compounded of particular matter and\nform—a form that is really identical with and formally distinct\nfrom the specific nature itself that the primary substance\ninstantiates (SN, part VI, chap. 1, fols. 92vb–93ra).\nThe concepts of matter and form are relative, since their meanings are\nconnected with each other (In Post., fol. 40rb). Being the\nform of something and being the matter of something are converse\nrelations of three different kinds, whose arguments and values\nare: \nThe specific nature (or essence) can be conceived from a twofold point\nof view: intensionally (in abstracto) and extensionally\n(in concreto). Intensionally viewed, the specific nature\nsimply expresses the set of essential properties that compose a\ncategorial form, without any reference to the existence of individuals\nwhich, if there are any, instantiate it. Extensionally viewed, the\nspecific nature is that same form conceived of as instantiated by at\nleast one singular entity. For instance, human nature intensionally\nconsidered is humanity (humanitas); extensionally it is man\n(homo) (In Porph., prooem., fol. 9va). Both\nof them are substantial forms superordinated to the whole human\ncompound, but while humanity is properly a form, i.e. something\nexistentially incomplete and dependent, man is an existentially\nautonomous and independent entity. Thus they differ from each other in\nthe same way as a predicate (for example ‘P’)\ndiffers from a formula (for example,\n‘P(x)’). \nBecause of the complexity of the metaphysical composition of the\nfinite corporeal being, every creature has four different levels of\nbeing: real, essential, temporal, and individual. Real being is\nnothing but the whole reality of the finite being. Essential being is\nthe mode of being proper to the specific nature that a certain\nsingular directly instantiates. Temporal being is the state of affairs\ndesignated by infinitival expressions like ‘being a man’\n(‘hominem esse’) or ‘being white’\n(‘esse album’)—that is, the object of the\nact of judging. Finally, individual being is the actual existence of\nthe primary substance of a finite being as distinct from the whole\nreality of the finite being itself (SN, part VI, chap. 1,\nfol. 92vb). \nPaul asserts the following relationships among these four levels of\nbeing and the essence of a creature: the essence and being of any\ncreature are not really distinct from each other; the essence of a\nthing is formally different from its real being and from its essential\nbeing; the essence and the essential being of a thing are formally\n(ratione) different from temporal and individual beings;\nspecific and generic essences can keep on being even though no\nindividual instantiates them, but in this case they do not have any\nactual existence (esse actuale). From that point of view,\nSocrates being a man (Sortem esse hominem) is in reality\nSocrates himself considered together with all the properties of which\nhe is the bearer. On the other hand, the proposition identifies only\none of these properties, that signified by the predicate-term (in our\nexample the property of being a man), which is formally different from\nthe form (in our example that of humanity) connoted by the\npredicate-term itself (ibidem, fols. 92vb–93ra). \nAccording to Paul, who follows Duns Scotus and Wyclif on this subject,\nbeing is univocally shared by everything real, since it is the stuff\nthat the ten categories modulate according to their own essence\n(In Phys., book I, tr. 1, chap. 2, t. c. 13; In\nMetaph., book IV, tr. 1, chap. 1, fols. 122ra–125vb,\npassim; In Porph., chap. De specie, fol.\n22rb). In view of this position, Paul maintains no real distinction\nbetween essence and being (In Metaph., book IV, tr. 1, chap.\n2, fol. 127rb; book VI, chap. 1, fol. 223vb). Like Duns Scotus and\nWyclif, Paul speaks of a formal difference (or difference of reason)\nbetween essence and being in creatures, as the essence and the\nessential being of a thing are one and the same entity considered from\ntwo distinct points of view, intensionally (the essence) and\nextensionally (the being) (SN, part VI, chap. 1, fol.\n93ra). \nThis analysis identifies the opposition between essence and being with\nthe opposition between universals and individuals. Like Wyclif, Paul\nthinks of essence as a universal form intensionally considered, and\nexistence (taken in the strict sense) as the mode of being proper to\nprimary substances. Thus, when Paul affirms that essence and being are\nreally identical and formally different, he simply restates the thesis\nof the real identity and formal distinction between universals and\nindividuals that was typical of the Realists of the late Middle Ages.\nConsequently, like Burley and Wyclif, Paul holds that a formal\nuniversal actually (in actu) exists outside our minds only if\nthere is at least one individual that instantiates it, so that without\nindividuals common natures (or essences) are not really universals\n(SN, part VI, chap. 2, fol. 94ra). \nThis means that the relationship between common natures and singulars\nis ultimately grounded on individuation, since no actual universality\nand no instantiation is possible without individuation. On this\nsubject Paul successfully reconciles the Scotistic approach with\ncertain Thomistic theses. Paul claims that the principle of\nindividuation is twofold, immanent and remote. The immanent principle\nis the one whose presence necessarily entails the existence of the\nindividual it constitutes, and whose absence necessarily entails the\nnon-existence (or disappearance) of the individual. The remote\nprinciple, on the other hand, is just what the immanent principle\npresupposes, but whose presence and absence alone are insufficient for\ncausing the existence or disappearance of the individual, as it\ncontinues being after the corruption of the individual. Thisness\n(haecceitas) is the immanent principle of individuation,\nwhereas form, matter, and quantity are the remote principle. Thisness\nin turn has a twofold origin, as it derives from matter and form\ntogether in the case of corporeal substances, and as it derives from\nthe essence (quidditas) alone in the case of angelic\nintelligences (SN, part VI, chap. 5, fol. 95vb). Furthermore,\naccording to Paul there is a close similarity between the thisness,\nwhich he now calls individual difference (differentia\nindividualis), and the specific difference. The specific\ndifference is what differentiates the species from the genus, since it\nis the determination or property which, once added to the genus,\nresults in the species. On the other hand, the specific difference is\nreally identical with the genus, from which it is distinct only in\nvirtue of a formal principle. The same happens to the individual\ndifference: it is what differentiates the individual from the species;\nfrom the ontological point of view, it is really identical with and\nformally distinct from the species itself; and it is the formal\nprinciple in virtue of which the individual is what it is, something\nparticular, concrete, and perfectly determined in itself (SN,\npart VI, chap. 5, fol. 96rb; chap. 26, fol. 112rb–va;\nQdU, fol. 128va; fol. 129rb; In Metaph., book III,\ntr. 1, chap. 1, fol. 83vb). \nAs far as the problem of angelic individuation is concerned, the\nlogical consequence deriving from such premisses is that it is\nimpossible to find two angels who share the same specific nature and\nare numerically distinct, since only one haecceitas can\nspring up from an incorporeal species (SN, part VI, chap. 5,\nfol. 96ra). This solution is close to the inner meaning of Duns\nScotus’ position and contrasts with Aquinas’ view, although Paul\naffirms that the angelic intelligences are specifically, and not\nnumerically, different. In fact, according to St. Thomas, angels are\nspecifically different because they are incorporeal, and without\nmatter no individuation is possible. On the contrary, Paul of Venice\nthinks angels are individuated by means of thisnesses, but not\nmultiplied by them, because of the absence of matter, so that there is\nonly one angel per species. Since specific natures of incorporeal\nbeings do not include any reference to matter, only a unique principle\nof individuation (ratio suppositalis) can flow from such\nspecies. As a consequence, no angel is one in number in the strict\nsense of the term (as being one in number necessarily implies the\nactual presence of a multiplicity of things of the same species), even\nthough broadly speaking every angel is one in number, as two (or more)\nangels are, after all, “many things”—but never many\nangels of the same kind (SN, part VI, chap. 5, fol.\n95vb). \nIn his last work, the commentary on the Ars Vetus, Paul\nsummarizes his position as follows: \nIn this way Paul of Venice tried to solve the aporetic aspects of Duns\nScotus’ theory of individuation. Scotus said nothing about the problem\nof the relation between the thisness and the particular matter and\nform that constitute the individual. The Franciscan master was also\nsilent about a possible identification of the thisness with one of the\ntwo essential forms of the individual substance, the forma\npartis (for instance, the individual soul) and the forma\ntotius (the human nature). Paul identifies the principle of\nindividuation with the informing act through which the specific nature\nmolds its matter. This identification had been already suggested by\nthe opposition between immanent and remote principles of individuation\ndescribed in the Summa philosophiae naturalis. In fact, all\nthe constituents of the individual compound (matter, form, and\nquantity) had been contrasted with the thisness, which for that reason\ncould not be identified with any of them. Moreover, it is obvious\nthat: \nAccording to the standard medieval realist theories of knowledge, as\nexemplified by Thomas Aquinas and Giles of Rome, the primary object of\nthe human intellect is the essence of material things. Such essences\nbecome intelligible to us only when our intellect has abstracted them\nfrom the individualising properties connected with the matter, so that\nwe can have direct knowledge of universals only. Yet, an intellective\nknowledge of individuals is possible, if the intellect, after\nabstracting the intelligible species through which it grasps essences,\nturns its attention to the phantasm from which it has drawn the\nintelligible species itself. This action, the conversion to phantasm,\nproduces a reflexive (that is, indirect) and incomplete knowledge of\nthe individual thing represented by the phantasm itself. On the other\nhand, according to the standard medieval nominalist theories of\nknowledge, as exemplified by Ockham, individuals alone are the object\nof our intellect, and the main form of human cognition is not the\nabstractive one, but intuitive cognition, which properly concerns the\nexistence and non-existence of individual things, as it is that\nimmediate apprehension of a thing (that is, an individual substance or\nquality) as existent which enables us to form a contingent proposition\nconcerning the existence of that same thing. By contrast, abstractive\nknowledge is an apprehension of terms by which it is impossible for us\nto have evidence of whether or not a certain thing exists. Thus,\nintuitive and abstractive cognition attain the same singular objects,\nbut in different ways, since abstractive cognition is indifferent to\nexistence and produces a universal sign of a multiplicity of\nsingulars.  \nThese different epistemological explanations depend also on\ndifferences in ontology. According to medieval Realists, individuals\ncannot be the proper (not even a proper) and adequate object of\nknowledge for any intellect, since (1) their world includes common\nnatures or essences besides individual things; (2) individuals stem\nfrom species by means of prime matter (plus quantity); and (3) prime\nmatter is per se something opaque and unintelligible. Apart from the\nunsuitable theological consequences (how is it possible that God knows\nhuman beings perfectly, if every kind of individual is per se\nsomething not completely intelligible?), the realist account entails a\nparadox, as the phantasm already enables us to grasp the substance and\nthe accidental properties of an individual thing far before the\nconversion to itself which follows intellective cognition, because it\nis an appropriate image (or representation) of the particular material\nobject perceived by the senses. On the other hand, the punctum dolens\nof any nominalist description of the process of knowledge lies in the\ndifficulty in explaining the nature and origin of abstractive\ncognition and the relation which holds between the universal sign and\nthe individuals which it refers to—how can they constitute a\nnatural set? How can we know under a universal form (universaliter)\nsomething which is in itself absolutely singular? \nIt is just in order to do away with the peculiar problems of the\nrealist paradigm that Paul of Venice worked out a new version of the\nstandard medieval realist theories of knowledge, critical of the most\ncommon solutions proper to his intellectual environment, and where\nmuch more stress is put on the question of class-membership, and on\nthe intellective cognition of individuals. \nAs to the problem of the relation of soul to body, Paul rejects the\nAugustinian conception and follows the Aristotelian view of the soul\nas form of the body, so that in his opinion the subject of knowledge\nis not the soul alone, but the whole human composite. Not even\nsensation can be attributed simply to the soul using a body, as\nAugustine had thought. Moreover, against Aristotle and following\nAquinas, Paul claims that, although it is the form of the body, the\nhuman soul is a self-subsistent form, and therefore incorruptible.\nHowever, unlike Aquinas, he maintains that the human soul is two-fold,\nas the complete human soul (anima totalis) derives from the close\nunion of two distinct principles, the cogitative and the intellective.\nThis fact does not break the unity of the human soul nor of the human\ncomposite, since (1) the cogitative principle is the cause of the\nanimality and the intellective one of the rationality of man; (2)\nneither of them can exist in man without the other; and (3) the\ncogitative soul is in potency in relation to the intellective one\n(Summa philosophiae naturalis, ed. Venetiis 1503 [=\nSN], pars v, ch. 5, fols. 68vb and 69ra; see also\nScriptum super libros De anima ed. Venetiis 1504 [= In De\nan.], II, t.c. 23, fols. 47rb-48ra). \nLike Thomas Aquinas and Giles of Rome, Paul maintains that there is a\nreal distinction between the soul and its faculties, but, in\nopposition to them, he holds that there is only a formal distinction\n(ratione et definitione) between the faculties themselves\n(SN, p. v, ch. 4, fol. 68ra-b). Whereas the faculties of the\ncogitative soul depend on bodily organs for their operations, the\nfaculties of the intellective soul, i.e. the active intellect, the\npassive intellect, and the will, are independent, even though in the\nstate of union with the body they need sensation for exercising their\npowers, and no act of sensation can be produced without the\nconcurrence of the body (SN, p. v, ch. 10, fols. 71va-72ra.).\nBesides the vegetative faculty (which regulates nutrition, growth, and\nreproduction) and the power of locomotion, the faculties of the\ncogitative soul are the following: the five exterior senses, the\ngeneral sense (sensus communis), the fantasy\n(phantasia), the vis aestimativa (or\ncogitativa properly so called), and the memory. Against\nAvicenna, Paul explicitly denies that there is a fifth internal sense,\nthe imagination, since he thinks that its presumed operations are the\nsame as those of the fantasy (SN, p. v, ch. 30, fol. 84ra).\nThe general sense distinguishes and collates the data of the special\nexterior senses. The fantasy conserves the species apprehended by\nsenses and freely combines them together to produce figments. The\ncogitativa recognizes those properties of things which cannot\nbe perceived through the senses, like, for example, that something is\nuseful for a certain purpose, or friendly, or unfriendly. The memory\nis the ‘warehouse’ where all the species are stored, so\nthat the cogitative soul can perform its tasks even without the\npresence of any material object (see SN, p. v, ch. 30, fol.\n84ra-va). \nAccording to Paul, the qualities which are the adequate and per se\nobject of the exterior senses cause a peculiar modification in the\nbodily organs, that is the presence in them of a forma\nintentionalis or species sensibilis, which does not\nimply any material mutation in the organ itself, as such a form is a\nresembling image (similitudo) of the real form which started\nthe process totally lacking extension, and therefore unable to modify\nin any way the matter of the bodily organs (cf. SN, p. v, ch.\n23, fol. 79va, and ch. 30, fol. 84rb). As a consequence, Paul affirms\nthat the species sensibilis is a pure form without matter in\na two-fold sense: it is not grounded on matter, and it has no\nextension. Yet, as a resembling image of a real form it contains in\nitself a sort of logical description of the matter to which the real\nform gives structure (see SN, p. v, ch. 23, fol. 79 vb). When the\nspecies meets the potentia sensitiva of the bodily organ, a\nsensation is produced, by means of which the soul becomes aware of the\nexternal existence of a certain reality (SN, p. v, ch. 28,\nfol. 83ra). This process is totally passive, as exterior senses can\ngive birth to sensations only in virtue of the actual presence of the\nmaterial object (SN, p. v, ch. 10, fol. 71va-b). The\nspecies sensibilis present in one of the exterior senses and\nthe species sensibilis present in the sensus\ncommunis (and in the other internal senses), differ specifically\n(specifice) from each other, since they are images of objects\nof different types. In fact, the species present in the general sense\nis a species of species, as it is not the logical image of the\nexternal quality which caused the process of sensation, but an image\nof the species present in the exterior sense (SN, p. v, ch.\n28, fol. 83ra). The higher level of sense-knowledge is therefore\nqualitatively distinct from the lower. At the higher level, every\npassage from a faculty to another entails a sort of purification of\nthe forma intentionalis, which progressively loses the\ninformation on the individual characteristics of the external object\n(SN, p. v, ch. 40, fol. 90va). So the perceived thing is\nfirst apprehended by the cogitativa as this singular bearer\nof certain properties, then as a bearer of certain properties, a\nchange that Paul qualifies as a transition from the condition of\nintentio singularis signata to the condition of intentio\nsingularis vaga (In De an., III, t.c. 11, fol. 137rb).\nNot only does the cogitativa effect the transformation of the\nintentio singularis signata into an intentio singularis\nvaga, it also abstracts the substance, which is a sensibile\nper accidens (something accidentally perceptible) from the\nperceived accidental properties which are sensibilia per se\n(perceptible by themselves—In De an., III, t.c. 11,\nfol. 137rb; see also SN, p. v, ch. 11, fol. 72ra).  \nAs we have already seen, in Nicoletti’s view the phantasm is a\nrepresentation of the thing which started the process of knowing.\nAltough immaterial and free from any reference to the individualising\nproperties (of the thing at issue), the phantasm is not completely\nintelligible, since the intentio singularis vaga still\ncontains a sort of logical description of the generic matter which the\nsingular thing is made of, and through it to the general conditions\nfor individuation. For example, when we apprehend Socrates as a man,\nwe know human essence just as instantiated by a singular item, and not\nin itself, as a specific type. In order to have the concept of man,\nthere is need of a further and higher activity on the part of the\nsoul, which has to abstract from the phantasm the universal or\nintelligible species, which applies to all men. This further activity\nis the proper action of the active intellect, which illumines both the\nphantasm and the possible intellect, so impressing on the latter the\nspecies intelligibilis abstracted from the former (In De\nan., III, t.c. 11, fol. 137rb). \nAs for the possible (or passive) intellect, according to Nardi,\nRuello, and Kuksewicz, Paul was an Averroist, as he would have\nsupported the thesis of the unicity and separate character of such an\nintellect for the whole human species. But this is false. On the\ncontrary, Paul’s point of view for this question is close to\nthat of Thomas Aquinas, whose arguments against the unicity of the\npassive intellect he utilizes in his commentaries on the De\nanima and on the Metaphysics (after 1420). If his\naffirmations in the Summa philosophiae naturalis are a bit\nambiguous and it is therefore possible to miss their deepest meaning,\nin these two Aristotelian commentaries he clearly rejects all the main\ntheses of later medieval Averroism (see Amerini, 2012). He thinks that\n(1) the claim of the unicity of the possible intellect for the whole\nhuman species is lacking in a solid philosophical basis, since it can\nbe maintained from the physical point of view only, according to which\neverything is considered qua affected-by or connected-with motion, but\n(2) it is false from the metaphysical point of view, which is the most\ncomprehensive of all. From this viewpoint, according to which the\npossible intellect has to be considered a substantial form (and more\nprecisely, the form of the human body), it is evident that it has a\nbeginning in time, but certainly not an end, and that, like any other\nmaterial substantial form, it is multiplied according to the\nmultiplication of bodies, since one and the same principle in number\ncannot be the form of a multiplicity of substances. Furthermore, given\nthat different men can form different opinions about the same thing or\nevent, one and the same intellect could hold contradictory views at\nonce, in apparent violation of the law of contradiction (see In De\nan., III, t.c. 27, fol. 149ra). \nIn the SN Paul had spoken of the active intellect in terms of\na separated substance. The active intellect is connected to the\npossible intellect and the human soul by inherence and to the phantasm\nas the phantasm is directly present before it (cf. SN, p. v,\nch. 38, fol. 89ra). On the contrary, in the commentary on the De\nanima, he (1) identifies the active intellect with God Himself,\nconsidered as the first cause, and its own activity with God’s\nactivity of illumination in and outside the soul, and (2) affirms that\nthe active intellect is joined to the possible intellect neither by\ninherence nor by information, but as a form directly present in it\n(In De an., III, t.c. 19, fol. 143ra). This fact explains why\nthe first of the four main effects produced by the active intellect is\nset in the external world, and the fourth one both in the external\nworld and in the human mind. In turn, the mutual connections and\ndistinctive features of the actions performed by the active intellect\nexplain why (1) individuals are proper objects of intellection for us;\n(2) the intelligible species is singular and not universal; and (3)\nthe same intelligible species by means of which we grasp substantial\nessences is the medium in virtue of which we can understand the\npeculiar structure of the individual which instantiates that essence\n(In De an., III, t.c. 11, fols. 136vb and 137rb-va)—all\ntheses which are just the opposite of the most common realist\nconvictions on the matter, as Paul himself points out (In De\nan., III, t.c. 27, fol. 137va). \nAs a consequence, he explicitly polemicizes with Giles of Rome and\nThomas Aquinas on the problem of the cognition of individuals. He sums\nup their position in four theses, accepts the first one, and argues\nagainst the last three. The four theses are the following: \nAs far as the second thesis is concerned, Paul thinks that the first\nintelligible species present in our mind is about a singular item and\nenables us to know it, as the first intelligible species is drawn from\nthe phantasm, which is formally and per se the mental representation\nof an individual item, and therefore singular itself (phantasma\nest intentio singularis). The third and fourth theses are\nquestioned together. Paul raises two main objections against them. The\nfirst one runs as follows: if we can know the individual which causes\nthe process of intellection only after the cognition of the universal,\nthen something in the cognition of the universal functions as a medium\nfor this new apprehension. It cannot be the universal itself, as it is\nnot more similar to this individual than to any other; so it must be\nsomething singular, distinct from the universal and added to it. But,\nif so, then this singular is to be known per se and directly (because\nif per accidens and/or indirectly, then only in virtue of something\nelse, which in turn would become the new medium for the cognition of\nthe individual, and so on) far before the conversion to the phantasm,\nwhich is therefore totally superfluous. The second objection is even\nmore articulated. Paul observes that, if our intellect apprehends the\nsingular thing which starts the process of understanding only by means\nof the conversion to the phantasm, then the phantasm acts upon the\nintellect, impressing an image (or species) on it. If the image\nimpressed is universal, then the passive intellect cannot apprehend\nany singular thing by means of it; as a consequence, it can only be\nparticular; but in this case the phantasm performs just the same\naction as before the conversion to itself, which is therefore\nredundant. Nor can one say that the phantasm does not act upon the\npassive intellect, because in this case the conversion to it would be\neven more unnecessary, if possible, and material items would be known\nby us in the same way as God and the (angelic) intelligences, which\nare immaterial (In De an., III, t.c. 11, fols.\n136vb-137ra). \nAs is evident, the Italian master is aware of the paradox entailed by\nthe standard realist account of human knowledge and his theory is a\nserious attempt to avoid it. Paul refuses Aquinas’s and\nGiles’s views since they imply that the intellectual\napprehension of the universal essence, because of its two-fold\nrelation to the phantasm, at once presupposes the sense-apprehension\nof the individual thing (which instantiates that essence) and is\npresupposed by the intellectual apprehension of the individual thing.\nSince at the level of sense-apprehension of individual items the human\nsoul, through the cogitativa, is already able to recognize\nthe substance (of those individual things), the intellectual\napprehension cannot in any way add new information on the res\nat issue and must be totally identical with the sense-apprehension. As\na consequence, instead of elaborating an interpretative pattern of\nhuman knowledge based on the form of the spiral, where the same things\ncome back to our soul at different moments in the process of\nabstraction, Paul tacitly develops in an original way some suggestions\ndrawn from Walter Burley’s prologue to his last commentary on\nthe Physics. In criticizing Averroes’s thesis that the\nquidditas of material things is the primary object of our\nunderstanding and the material and individual things themselves a\nsecondary object, Paul explains our knowledge in terms of a sort of\nstraight line which proceeds from the most superficial to the deepest\nlevels of reality, and states that our intellect is equally apt to\nreceive both universal and singular species, and, as a consequence,\nthat it is apt to know both common essences and singular things\n(In De an., III, t.c. 11, fol. 136va-b). \nThis solution introduces the chief thesis of the nominalist approach\nto epistemology (the direct knowledge of individuals) into a realist\ncontext; nevertheless it is consistent with the metaphysical\npresuppositions proper to the late medieval realist way of thought.\nWith the noteworthy exception of Walter Burley, according to any late\nmedieval Realist, in the extramental world universal essences and\nindividual things come together, since they are really identical and\nonly formally distinct, although universal essence belongs to a deeper\nlevel of reality. In a certain way they are two different aspects of\nthe same thing. This fact explains what happens in the process of\nknowledge according to Paul: since the intelligible species is\ndirectly connected with the essence of a thing and indirectly, by\nmeans of the phantasm, with the singular thing itself (cf. In De\nan., III, t.c. 11, fol. 137rb), our intellect grasps the\nuniversal essence and the individual thing at the same time, so that\nboth of them are the primary objects of our mind, even though the\nuniversal essence is the primary object by nature (primitate\nnaturae - In De an., III, t.c. 11, fol. 137va; see also\nSN, p. v, ch. 39, fol. 90va). \nPaul deals with the problem of divine ideas in his commentary on book\nVII of the Metaphysics (tr. 3, chap. 2) and at the end of the\nQuaestio de universalibus (tenth conclusion: universalia\nplatonica et idealia sunt ex natura rei in mente divina causaliter\nponenda). The cornerstone of his theory of divine exemplarism is\nthe conviction that there is a close parallelism between human\nartificers as producers of artifacts and God as a creator—only\nin this way, according to Paul, can the main goal of every theory of\ndivine ideas (that is, the explanation of the rationality of creation\nas a free act of God) be achieved. Paul develops four rational pieces\nof evidence for supporting the thesis of the eternal existence in\nGod’s mind of a multiplicity of ideas, conceived of as the formal\npatterns and principles (exemplaria) of creatures. \nThe first argument goes as follows: since the prima causa\nproduces individuals which differ in species (type) from each other\n(say men and horses), they are produced according to different formal\nprinciples, as the effects of the same principle are identical in\ntype. The second is that if A and B are two different\ncreatures (say a man and a donkey) that God is going to create, their\nmutual differences cannot be grounded on their own beings, since they\nare not yet existing things; therefore they have to be found in\nsomething pertaining to God’s productive potency, which will act\naccording to different principles present in it. The third argument is\nunsound: Paul argues that since in God each generic principle\n(ratio generis) is different from any corresponding specific\nprinciple (ratio speciei), therefore specific principles too\nare different from each other. Unfortunately, the proof he makes use\nof for showing the difference in reality between generic and specific\nprinciples is inconsistent. He affirms that if the generic and\nspecific principles were not distinct, then God could not create\nsomething according to the generic principle without creating it\naccording to a correlated specific principle—while this is just\nwhat happens, since no animal can be created which is not an animal of\na certain species or type (a man, or a monkey, or a mouse). The fourth\nargument is that, since God knows that animal is the genus of man and\nthat being-an-animal is included in the definition of man, He thinks\nof them by means of two different principles; otherwise He could not\ndistinguish them (QdU, fols. 133vb–134ra). \nIn the commentary on the Metaphysics, the Italian master,\nafter denying that the ideas are self-subsistent entities, as Plato\nthought, maintains that the meaning of the term ‘idea’ is\ntwofold: (i) broadly speaking (communiter), an idea is a\nspecific essence or nature (quidditas specifica), existing in\na mind as a causal model for the production of something; (ii)\nproperly speaking (proprie), an idea is a specific essence\nexisting in God’s mind as a causal model for the production of\nsomething (In Metaph., book VII, tr. 3, chap. 2, fol. 298va).\nFrom these definitions, which he considers consonant with the teaching\nof Aristotle and Averroes, Paul derives four consequences or theses,\nwhich, taken together, represent the very core of his theory of divine\nideas: \nIn sum, according to Paul, divine ideas play a threefold role in\nrelation to God and creatures: they are (i) the specific essences of\nindividual things themselves, considered according to their\nintelligible being in the mind of God; (ii) God’s principles of\ncognition of creatures; and (iii) the eternal models of creatures. If\nwe also take into account that in his opinion (i) divine ideas are\nreally the same as the divine essence and formally distinct from it,\nand (ii) this distinction originates from their being efficient\n(co-)causes in relation to the different kinds of creatures, we can\neasily realize how close his position was to Wyclif’s, which was\nconsidered heretical because of its consequences: metaphysical and\ntheological necessitarianism; restriction of divine omnipotence;\ndenial of the process of transubstantiation in the Eucharist. In order\nto avoid this form of necessitarianism, Paul, both in the commentary\non the Metaphysics and in the Quaestio de\nuniversalibus, maintains that in God there is an infinite number\nof ideas, some of which only have been brought into existence by Him.\nIn fact, there is a formal difference between the supreme principle of\nunderstanding of possibles, which is the divine essence itself as\ninfinitely imitable ad extra, and divine ideas, which are the\npractical principles of the production of creatures (In\nMetaph., book VII, tr. 3, chap. 2, fol. 298va; see also\nQdU, fol. 135rb). But he admits that we should conclude that\nideas in God are finite in number, if we considered the problem\nexclusively from the point of view of natural philosophy\n(ibidem). \nThe differences between Paul’s doctrine and that of Thomas Aquinas,\nhis main source, on the one hand, and Wyclif’s, on the other hand, are\nevident. Paul agrees with Wyclif against Thomas that divine ideas are\nthe specific essences of individual creatures, considered according to\ntheir intelligible being in the mind of God, and efficient (co-)causes\nin relation to the different kinds of creatures, while he agrees with\nThomas against Wyclif that there is a distinction between being a mere\nprinciple of understanding (ratio) and being an effective\nmodel of production (exemplar). If Paul did not accept such a\ndistinction, his theory would be substantially the same as Wyclif’s.\nOn the contrary, not only does he accept this Thomistic distinction,\nbut he develops it in an autonomous way, which makes his admission of\nthe existence of an infinite number of ideas in God superfluous.\nAccording to Thomas, divine rationes and divine\nexemplaria are two different types of ideas, the former\nlinked to pure speculative knowledge only, the latter linked to\npractical knowledge. Only exemplaria are ideas in the strict\nsense of the term. Paul’s definition of divine ideas excludes that the\n(Thomistic) divine rationes can be considered ideas, since a\ndivine idea is the (i) specific nature (of a certain set of\nindividuals) existing in God’s mind, (ii) principle of actuality, and\n(iii) efficient cause in relation to creatures. Now, the Thomistic\nrationes do not satisfy any of these requirements. Within\nPaul’s system, what plays the role of the Thomistic rationes\nis the divine essence itself, which is the supreme principle of\nknowledge of possibles, but not an idea. Moreover, in Paul’s view,\ndivine ideas are formally distinct from the divine essence. This means\nthat, in principle, the divine essence and divine ideas are different\nentities. In fact, Paul’s definition of formal distinction inverts the\nterms of the question in relation to the preceding approaches, as Paul\nis attempting to reduce multiplicity to unity (the passage is from\nmany to one). What Paul wants to account for is the way in which many\ndifferent entities of a certain kind (i.e. of an incomplete and\ndependent mode of existence) can constitute one and the same\nsubstance. Hence, within Paul’s theory of divine ideas the gap between\nthe sphere of the possible and the sphere of the existent is deeper\nthan in Thomas’. The possible is grounded on God considered as a\nknower, while the existent is grounded on God considered as a maker;\nideas play a role only in creation, while the sole divine essence is\nsufficient for allowing God to know possibles (see In\nMetaph., book XII, tr. 2, chap. 3, part 2, fols.\n466vb–467ra). \nTherefore, Nicoletti’s view can be summarized as follows: (i) divine\nideas are really identical with and formally different from the divine\nessence; (ii) ideas are both direct, but secondary, objects of divine\nintellection (the primary object being the divine essence itself) and\nthat by means of which God knows every existent other than Himself;\n(iii) there are no ideas of individuals or of prime matter. Paul’s\nposition is more influenced by (Neo-)platonic presuppositions than\nthat of Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas appealed to a sort of non-real mode of\nexistence of divine ideas, originating from the relations of\nimitability holding between the divine essence and possible creatures,\nso that the existence of divine ideas is purely of reason. Paul of\nVenice tries the opposite way of hypostatizing ideas—his\npeculiar version of the formal distinction enables him to do so\nwithout compromising divine simplicity. He can therefore claim that\nthe divine essence is the substrate of divine ideas, as if they were a\nsort of accidents inhering in a substance. As a consequence, the\nstatement that the ideas are direct but secondary objects of divine\nintellection means that God’s intellection first grasps the divine\nessence and then ideas, even though God’s intuition of Himself and\nGod’s intuition of ideas are not distinct. In fact, divine ideas are\nnot the specific natures of creatures as creatures are conceived of\nterminative in themselves by God, but as they are conceived\nof subiective in Him, that is, by means of a different\nreality (the divine essence) and according to their relation of\nontological dependence upon the divine essence itself. The identity\nbetween divine ideas and the esse ideale proper to specific\nnatures, and the relation of one-to-many holding between specific\nnatures and the individuals which originate from them, explain how God\ncan know individuals perfectly—even though mediately, through\nideas. In fact, infinite individual causal principles derive from one\nand the same divine idea, formally distinct from each other. They\ncorrespond to the thisnesses (haecceitates), which on the\nlevel of existence give rise to individuals from species. As\nthisnesses are the formal principles in virtue of which individuals\nare what they are, something particular, concrete, and perfectly\ndetermined in itself, so these individual causal principles deriving\nfrom ideas are what causes the passage from the specific ideal\nstandard to the analytical description of its instantiations\n(QdU, fol. 135ra). Prime matter, which is a necessary\nconstituent of any corporeal thing, is known by God in the same way as\nindividuals are: not in itself, but derivatively in something else\n(ibidem, fol. 135rb).","contact.mail":"alessandro.conti@cc.univaq.it","contact.domain":"cc.univaq.it"}]
