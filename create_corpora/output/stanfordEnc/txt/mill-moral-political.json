He was one\nof the last systematic philosophers, making significant contributions\nin logic, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and\nsocial theory. He was also an important public figure, articulating the\nliberal platform, pressing for various liberal reforms, and serving in\nParliament. During Mill’s lifetime, he was most widely admired for his\nwork in theoretical philosophy and political economy. However, nowadays\nMill’s greatest philosophical influence is in moral and political\nphilosophy, especially his articulation and defense of utilitarianism\nand liberalism (Nicholson 1998). This entry will examine Mill’s\ncontributions to the utilitarian and liberal traditions. We will\nconcentrate on his two most popular and best known works,\nUtilitarianism (1861, cited as U) and On\nLiberty (1859, cited as OL), drawing on other texts when\nthis sheds light on his utilitarian and liberal principles. We will\nconclude by looking at how Mill applies these principles to issues of\npolitical and sexual equality in Considerations on Representative\nGovernment (1859, cited as CRG), Principles of\nPolitical Economy (1848, cited as PPE), and The\nSubjection of Women (1869, cited as SW).\n\n\n\nOne cannot properly appreciate the development of Mill’s moral and\npolitical philosophy without some understanding of his intellectual\nbackground. Mill was raised in the tradition of Philosophical\nRadicalism, made famous by Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), John\nAustin (1790–1859), and his father James Mill (1773–1836),\nwhich applied utilitarian principles in a self-conscious and systematic\nway to issues of institutional design and social reform. Utilitarianism\nassesses actions and institutions in terms of their effects on human\nhappiness and enjoins us to perform actions and design institutions so\nthat they promote—in one formulation, maximize—human\nhappiness. Utilitarianism was a progressive doctrine historically,\nprincipally because of its universal scope—its\ninsistence that everyone’s happiness matters—and its\negalitarian conception of impartiality—its insistence\nthat everyone’s happiness matters equally. Because of these general\ncharacteristics of utilitarianism, the Radicals’ application of\nutilitarian principles to social institutions tended to challenge\ntraditional institutions of class and privilege and support egalitarian\nreforms. \n\nAs documented in his Autobiography (1873), Mill was groomed\nfrom birth by his father to become the ultimate Victorian intellectual\nand utilitarian reformer. As part of this apprenticeship, Mill was\nexposed to an extremely demanding education, shaped by utilitarian\nprinciples. While Mill followed the strict intellectual regimen laid\ndown by his father for many years, he suffered a profound intellectual\nand emotional crisis in the period 1826–1830. Mill’s recovery was\nassisted by friendships he formed with Thomas Carlyle and Samuel\nColeridge, who introduced him to ideas and texts from the Romantic and\nConservative traditions. As Mill emerged from his depression, he became\nmore concerned with the development of well-rounded individuals and\nwith the role of feeling, culture, and creativity in the happiness of\nindividuals (see Capaldi 2004). \n\nThough Mill never renounced the liberal and utilitarian tradition\nand mission that he inherited from his father, his mental crisis and\nrecovery greatly influenced his interpretation of this tradition. He\nbecame critical of the moral psychology of Bentham and his father and\nof some of the social theory underlying their plans for reform. It is\narguable that Mill tends to downplay the significance of his\ninnovations and to underestimate the intellectual discontinuities\nbetween himself and his father. One measure of the extent of Mill’s\ndeparture from the views of Bentham and James Mill is that Mill’s\nfather came to view him as a defector from the utilitarian cause\n(Autobiography 189). We need to try to understand the extent\nof the transformation Mill brings to the utilitarian and liberal\nprinciples of the Radicals. \n\nSome of Mill’s most significant innovations to the utilitarian\ntradition concern his claims about the nature of happiness and the role\nof happiness in human motivation. Bentham and James Mill understand\nhappiness hedonistically, as consisting in pleasure, and they believe\nthat the ultimate aim of each person is predominantly, if not\nexclusively, the promotion of the agent’s own happiness (pleasure). \n\nBentham begins his Introduction to the Principles of Morals and\nLegislation (1789) with this hedonistic assumption about human\nmotivation. \n\nNature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign\nmasters, pain and pleasure (Principles I\n1). \n\nBentham allows that we may be moved by the pleasures and pains of\nothers. But he appears to think that these other-regarding pleasures\ncan move us only insofar as we take pleasure in the pleasure of others\n(V 32). This suggests that Bentham endorses a version of psychological\negoism, which claims that the agent’s own happiness is and can be the\nonly ultimate object of his desires. In his unfinished\nConstitutional Code (1832), Bentham makes this commitment to\npsychological egoism clear. \n\nOn the occasion of every act he exercises, every human being is led\nto pursue that line of conduct which, according to his view of the\ncase, taken by him at the moment, will be in the highest degree\ncontributory to his own greatest happiness. (Introduction, §2) \n\nBentham is a hedonist about utility or happiness, treating happiness\nas consisting in pleasure (Principles I 3). So the version of\npsychological egoism to which he is attracted is psychological\nhedonism. Bentham does not say why he believes that one’s own pleasure\nis the only ultimate object of desire. He may see it as a\ngeneralization from his observations about the motives underlying human\nbehavior. \n\nJames Mill also treats psychological hedonism as axiomatic in his\nEssay on Government (1824). \n\nThe desire, therefore, of that power which is necessary to render\nthe persons and properties of human beings subservient to our\npleasures, is the grand governing law of human nature. (§IV; also\nsee §V) \n\nSometimes, Bentham appears to allow for a more diverse set of\nultimate motives or interests, including other-regarding motives\n(Principles X 25, X 36–38, XI 31; Table of the\nSprings of Action II 2). But these concessions to psychological\npluralism are exceptional. Even in contexts where Bentham recognizes\nmotivation that is not ultimately self-interested, he appears to treat\nit as weaker and less dependable than self-interested motivation\n(Book of Fallacies 392–93). \n\nBentham claims that utility not only describes human motivation but\nalso sets the standard of right and wrong (Principles I\n1). \n\nBy the principle of utility is meant that principle which approves\nor disapproves of every action whatsoever, according to the tendency\nwhich it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the\nparty whose interest is in question …. (Principles I\n2) \n\nIt remains to be determined whose happiness matters. One might\nimagine that it is the utility of the agent. This would be the ethical\ncounterpart to psychological egoism. However, Bentham’s answer, and the\nanswer characteristic of utilitarianism, is the happiness of all\n(Principles I 4–10). Bentham says that our account of\nright action, obligation, and duty ought to be governed by the\nprinciple of utility (I 9–10). This seems to imply that an action\nis right or obligatory just insofar as it promotes utility. But then\nthe right or obligatory act would seem to be the one that promotes\nutility the most or maximizes utility. For these reasons, it\nis common to understand Bentham as combining psychological hedonism and\nhedonistic utilitarianism. \n\nBut, if this is Bentham’s view, he faces a problem, for he combines\nthe ethical claim that each of us ought to aim at the general happiness\n(pleasure) with the psychological claim that each of us can only aim\n(ultimately) at his own happiness (pleasure). Here we seem to have a\nspecial case of the conflict between psychological egoism and\nmorality’s other-regarding or altruistic demands. \n\nBentham is not unaware of this tension. He addresses part of the\nproblem in the political context in other writings, notably his\nPlan for Parliamentary Reform (1817). In the political\ncontext, the problem is how we can get self-interested rulers to rule\nin the interest of the governed, as utilitarianism implies that they\nshould. Bentham’s answer invokes his commitment to representative\ndemocracy. We can reconcile self-interested motivation and promotion of\nthe common good if we make rulers democratically accountable to (all)\nthose whom they govern, for this tends to make the interest of the\ngoverned and the interest of the governors coincide. Bentham’s\nargument, elaborated by James Mill in his Essay on Government,\nis something like this. \n\nIt was this reasoning that led Bentham and James Mill to advocate\ndemocratic reforms that included extending the franchise to workers and\npeasant farmers. \n\nIn Principles Chapter IV Bentham sets out his conception of\npleasure and utility in more detail, distinguishing between intrinsic\nand relational dimensions of pleasures. For our purposes, some\ndimensions matter more than others. Hedonism says that pleasure is the\none and only intrinsic good and that pain is the one and only intrinsic\nevil. All other things have only extrinsic or instrumental value\ndepending on whether and, if so, how much pleasure or pain they\nproduce. Because the utilitarian asks us to maximize value, he has to\nbe able to make sense of quantities or magnitudes of value associated\nwith different options, where he assigns value to pleasure and disvalue\nto pain. Intensity, duration, and extent would appear to be the most\nrelevant variables here. Each option is associated with various\npleasures and pains both within a single life and across lives. For any\ngiven option we must find out how many pleasures and pains it produces,\nwhether those occur in a single life or in different lives. For every\ndistinct pleasure and pain, we must calculate its intensity and its\nduration. That would give us the total amount of (net) pleasure (or\npain) associated with each option. Then we must do that option with\ngreatest total. If there are two (or more) options with the greatest\ntotal, we are free to select any of these. \n\nBentham does not assume that our estimates of what will maximize\nutility will always be reliable. Nor does he assume that we should\nalways try to maximize utility (Principles I 13, IV 6). Doing\nso is costly, and we may sometimes promote utility best by not trying\nto promote it directly. Nonetheless, utility, he thinks, is the\nstandard of right conduct. \n\nThough Mill accepts the utilitarian legacy of the Radicals, he\ntransforms that legacy in important ways. Part of understanding Mill’s\ncontributions to the utilitarian tradition involves understanding his\ndisagreement with the Radicals on issues about human motivation and the\nnature of happiness. \n\nHenry Sidgwick (1838–1900), for one, read Mill as a\npsychological egoist (The Methods of Ethics 42–44). This\nis not just guilt by association. For it may appear that Mill endorses\npsychological egoism in his so-called “proof” of the\nprinciple of utility in Chapter IV of Utilitarianism. There,\nMill aims to show that happiness is the one and only thing desirable in\nitself (U IV 2). To do this, he argues that happiness is\ndesirable in itself (IV 3), and a central premise in this argument is\nthat everyone desires his own happiness (IV 3). Mill later argues that\nonly happiness is desirable (IV 4). \n\nBut the proof does not reveal Mill to be a psychological egoist.\nWhile Mill does say that each person has an ultimate desire for her own\nhappiness, he does not say that this is each person’s only ultimate\ndesire. Indeed, in the second half of the proof he allows that some\nagents have a disinterested concern for virtue and that they care about\nvirtue for its own sake (IV 4–5). And what is true of virtue is\nno less true of less grand objects of desire, such as money or power\n(IV 6). These too it is possible to desire for their own sakes. If\npsychological egoism claims that one’s own happiness is the only thing\nthat is desired for its own sake, then this shows that Mill is not a\npsychological egoist. \n\nIf we look outside of Utilitarianism we can find even\nclearer evidence of Mill’s doubts about psychological egoism and\nhedonism. In a note to his edition of James Mill’s Analysis of the\nPhenomena of the Human Mind (1869) John Stuart Mill diagnoses a\npossible equivocation in his father’s doctrine. \n\nThat the pleasures or pains of another person can only be\npleasurable or painful to us through the association of our own\npleasures and pains with them, is true in one sense, which is probably\nthat intended by the author, but not true in another, against which he\nhas not sufficiently guarded his mode of expression. It is evident,\nthat the only pleasures or pains of which we have direct experience\n… [are] those felt by ourselves … [and] that the pleasure\nor pain with which we contemplate the pleasure or pain felt by someone\nelse, is itself a pleasure or pain of our own. But if it be meant that\nin such cases the pleasure or pain is consciously referred to self, I\ntake this to be a mistake. (Notes II 217–18) \n\nIn his “Remarks on Bentham’s Philosophy” (1833) Mill\nurges a similar caution in understanding Bentham. \n\nIn laying down as a philosophical axiom that men’s actions are\nalways obedient to their interests, Mr. Bentham did no more than dress\nup the very trivial proposition that all people do what they feel\nthemselves most disposed to do …. He by no means intended by\nthis assertion to impute universal selfishness to mankind, for he\nreckoned the motive of sympathy as an interest. (CW X:\n13–14) \n\nIn both passages Mill makes what is now a familiar diagnosis of the\ntroubles with psychological egoism. He thinks that psychological egoism\nis ambiguous between a true but trivial thesis about the\nownership of desire—an agent necessarily acts on his own\ndesires—and a substantive but wildly implausible thesis about the\ncontent of desires—an agent’s ultimate desire is always\nand necessarily to promote his own interests or pleasure. If so, there\nis no thesis that is both substantive and plausible. The substantive\nthesis may seem speciously attractive if we tacitly confuse it with the\ntrivially true thesis. But it seems clear from Bentham’s and James\nMill’s worries about the conflict between ruler’s interests and the\ninterest of the ruled that they intend something like the substantive\npsychological thesis. But if they do so because they conflate it with\nthe trivial but true thesis, then they commit the fallacy of\nequivocation. \n\nSo Mill rejects the substantive doctrines of psychological egoism\nand hedonism that Bentham and his father sometimes defended or\nsuggested. This is really part of a larger criticism of the conception\nof psychology and human nature underlying Benthamite utilitarianism,\nwhich Mill elaborates in his essays on Bentham. Mill’s desire to\ndistance himself from Benthamite assumptions about human nature and\npsychology are also reflected in his conception of happiness and his\ndoctrine of higher pleasures. \n\nMill also disagrees with the Radicals about the nature of happiness.\nThough he never abandons the utilitarian tradition of the Radicals,\nMill modifies their assumptions about happiness. He explains his\ncommitment to utilitarianism early in Chapter II of\nUtilitarianism. \n\nThe creed which accepts as the foundations of morals\n“utility” or the “greatest happiness principle”\nholds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote\nhappiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By\nhappiness is intended pleasure and the absence of pain; by unhappiness,\npain and the privation of pleasure. (II 2; also see II 1) \n\nThis famous passage is sometimes called the Proportionality\nDoctrine. It sounds like Bentham. The first sentence appears to endorse\nutilitarianism, while the second sentence appears to endorse a\nhedonistic conception of utilitarianism. \n\nHedonism implies that the mental state of pleasure is the only thing\nhaving intrinsic value (and the mental state of pain is the\nonly intrinsic evil). All other things have only extrinsic\nvalue; they have value just insofar as they bring about, mediately or\ndirectly, intrinsic value (or disvalue). It follows that actions,\nactivities, etc. can have only extrinsic value, and it would seem that\ntheir value should depend entirely upon the quantity of\npleasure that they produce, where quantity is a function of the number\nof pleasures, their intensity, and their duration. This would mean that\none kind of activity or pursuit is intrinsically no better than\nanother. If we correctly value one more than another, it must be\nbecause the first produces more numerous, intense, or durable pleasures\nthan the other. \n\nMill worries that some will reject hedonism as a theory of value or\nhappiness fit only for swine (II 3). In particular, he worries that\nopponents will assume that utilitarianism favors sensual or voluptuary\npursuits (e.g., push-pin) over higher or nobler pursuits (e.g.,\npoetry). Mill attempts to reassure readers that the utilitarian can and\nwill defend the superiority of higher pleasures. \n\nHe begins by noting, with fairly obvious reference to Bentham, that\nthe hedonist can defend higher pursuits as extrinsically superior on\nthe ground that they produce more pleasure (II 4). While Mill thinks\nthat the Benthamite can defend the extrinsic superiority of higher\npleasure, he is not content with this defense of their superiority.\nMill insists that the greater value of intellectual pleasures can and\nshould be put on a more secure footing (II 4). He explains these higher\npleasures and links them with the preferences of a competent\njudge, in the following manner. \n\nIf I am asked what I mean by difference of quality in pleasures, or\nwhat makes one pleasure more valuable than another, merely as a\npleasure, except its being greater in amount, there is but one possible\nanswer. If one of the two is, by those who are competently acquainted\nwith both, placed so far above the other that they prefer it, even\nthough knowing it to be attended with a greater amount of discontent,\nand would not resign it for any quantity of the other pleasure which\ntheir nature is capable of, we are justified in ascribing to the\npreferred enjoyment a superiority in quality so far outweighing\nquantity as to render it, in comparison, of small account. (II 5) \n\nIndeed, Mill seems to claim here not just that higher pleasures are\nintrinsically more valuable than lower ones but that they are\ndiscontinuously better (II 6). \n\nThis certainly goes beyond Bentham’s quantitative hedonism. In fact,\nit is not even clear that Mill’s higher pleasures doctrine is\nconsistent with hedonism. Mill’s position here is hard to pin down, in\npart because he uses the term ‘pleasure’ sometimes to refer\nto (a) a certain kind of mental state or sensation and at other times\nto refer to (b) non-mental items, such as actions, activities, and\npursuits that do or can cause pleasurable mental states (consider the\nway in which someone might say that surfing was her greatest pleasure).\nWe might call (a)-type pleasures subjective pleasures and\n(b)-type pleasures objective pleasures. What’s unclear is\nwhether Mill’s higher pleasures are subjective pleasures or objective\npleasures. His discussion concerns activities that employ our higher\nfaculties. What’s unclear is whether higher pleasures refer to mental\nstates or sensations caused by higher activities or the activities\nthemselves. \n\nIt might seem clear that we should interpret higher pleasures as\nsubjective pleasures. After all, Mill has just told us that he is a\nhedonist about happiness. The Radicals may not have always been clear\nabout the kind of mental state or sensation they take pleasure to be,\nbut it seems clear that they conceive of it as some kind of mental\nstate or sensation. Some, like Bentham, appear to conceive of pleasure\nas a sensation with a distinctive kind of qualitative feel. Others,\nperhaps despairing of finding qualia common to all disparate kinds of\npleasures, tend to understand pleasures functionally, as mental states\nor sensations the subject, whose states these are, prefers and is\ndisposed to prolong. James Mill held something like this functional\nconception of pleasure (An Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human\nMind II, p. 184). Pleasures, understood functionally, could have\nvery different qualitative feels and yet still be pleasures. Insofar as\nMill does discuss subjective pleasures, he is not clear which, if\neither, of these conceptions of pleasure he favors. Nonetheless, it may\nseem natural to assume that as a hedonist he conceives of pleasures as\nsubjective pleasures. According to this interpretation, Mill is\nfocusing on pleasurable sensations and then distinguishing higher and\nlower pleasures by references to their causes. Higher pleasures are\npleasures caused by the exercise of our higher faculties, whereas lower\npleasures are pleasures caused by the exercise of our lower capacities.\nBut this interpretation of the higher pleasures doctrine is\nproblematic. \n\nOne concern is raised by Henry Sidgwick (Outlines 247).\nHedonism is committed to the idea that one pleasure is better than\nanother because it is more pleasurable. But this sounds like a\nquantitative relation. If higher pleasures are better than lower\npleasures, but not because they involve a greater quantity of pleasure,\nhow can this be squared with hedonism? One answer is that Mill thinks\nthat there are two factors affecting the magnitude of a pleasure: its\nquantity, as determined by its intensity and duration, and its quality\nor kind. On this proposal, one pleasure can be greater than another\nindependently of its quantity by virtue of its quality (Sturgeon\n2010). \n\nWe can distinguish among pleasures between those that are caused by\nthe exercise of our higher faculties and those that are caused by the\nexercise of our lower faculties. But why should this difference itself\naffect the pleasurableness of the state in question? If Mill holds a\npreference or functional conception of pleasure, according to which\npleasures are mental states that the subject prefers and other things\nbeing equal would prolong, then perhaps he could claim that pleasures\ncategorically preferred by competent judges are more pleasurable\npleasures. However, he says that competent judges have this preference\nfor the higher pleasure, “even though knowing it to be attended\nwith a greater amount of discontent” (U II 5). This\nsuggests that higher pleasures may not be more pleasurable even for\ncompetent judges, and in any case it’s not clear we could infer what\nwas more pleasurable for someone who was not a competent judge from\nwhat was more pleasurable from someone who was. So, even if we can\ndistinguish higher and lower pleasures, according to their causes, it\nremains unclear how the hedonist is to explain how higher pleasures are\ninherently more pleasurable. \n\nA related concern is how this interpretation of the higher pleasures\ndoctrine makes sense of Mill’s contrast between happiness and\ncontentment or satisfaction. After explaining higher pleasures in terms\nof the categorical preferences of competent judges and insisting that\ncompetent judges would not trade any amount of lower pleasures for\nhigher pleasures, he claims that this preference sacrifices contentment\nor satisfaction, but not happiness (II 6). Mill does not say that the\npreference of competent judges is for one kind of contentment over\nanother or that Socrates has more contentment than the pig or fool by\nvirtue of enjoying a different kind of contentment. Instead, he\ncontrasts happiness and contentment and implies that Socrates is\nhappier than the fool, even if less contented. \n\nAnother problem for this reading of the higher pleasures doctrine is\nthat Mill frequently understands higher pleasures as objective\npleasures. First, we have independent evidence that Mill sometimes uses\nthe word “pleasure” to refer to objective pleasures. For\ninstance, in the second part of the “proof” of the\nprinciple of utility in Chapter IV Mill counts music, virtue, and\nhealth as pleasures (IV 5). These seem to be objective pleasures.\nElsewhere in his discussion of higher pleasures in Chapter II, Mill\nequates a person’s pleasures with his “indulgences” (II 7)\nand with his “mode of existence” (II 8). Here too he seems\nto be discussing objective pleasures. When Mill introduces higher\npleasures (II 4) he is clearly discussing, among other things,\nintellectual pursuits and activities. He claims to be arguing that what\nthe quantitative hedonist finds extrinsically more valuable is also\nintrinsically more valuable (II 4, 7). But what the quantitative\nhedonist defends as extrinsically more valuable are complex activities\nand pursuits, such as writing or reading poetry, not mental states.\nBecause Mill claims that these very same things are intrinsically, and\nnot just extrinsically, more valuable, his higher pleasures would\nappear to be intellectual activities and pursuits, rather than mental\nstates. Finally, in paragraphs 4–8 Mill links the preferences of\ncompetent judges and the greater value of the objects of their\npreferences. But among the things Mill thinks competent judges would\nprefer are activities and pursuits. \n\nNow it is an unquestionable fact that those who are equally\nacquainted with and equally capable of appreciating and enjoying both\ndo give a most marked preference to the manner of existence\nwhich employs their higher faculties. (II 6; emphasis added) \n\nHere Mill is identifying the higher pleasures with activities and\npursuits that exercise our higher capacities. \n\nInsofar as Mill’s higher pleasures doctrine concerns objective\npleasures, it appears anti-hedonistic for two reasons. First, he claims\nthat the intellectual pursuits have value out of proportion to the\namount of contentment or pleasure (the mental state) that they produce.\nThis would contradict the traditional hedonist claim that the extrinsic\nvalue of an activity is proportional to its pleasurableness. Second,\nMill claims that these activities are intrinsically more valuable than\nthe lower pursuits (II 7). But the traditional hedonist claims that the\nmental state of pleasure is the one and only intrinsic good; activities\ncan have only extrinsic value, and no activity can be intrinsically\nmore valuable than another. \n\nWhichever way we read Mill’s higher pleasures doctrine, it is hard\nto square that doctrine with hedonism, as traditionally formulated.\nThis apparent inconsistency was noted by many of Mill’s subsequent\ncritics, including Sidgwick (Methods 93n, 94, 121), F.H.\nBradley (Ethical Studies 116–20), T.H. Green\n(Prolegomena to Ethics §§162–63), and G.E.\nMoore (Principia Ethica 71–72, 77–81). Green’s\ndiscussion is especially instructive. He focuses on Mill’s explanation\nof the preferences of competent judges for modes of existence that\nemploy their higher faculties. Mill explains the fact that competent\njudges prefer activities that exercise their rational capacities by\nappeal to their sense of dignity. \n\nWe may give what explanation we please of this unwillingness [on the\npart of a competent judge ever to sink into what he feels to be a lower\ngrade of existence] …but its most appropriate appellation is a\nsense of dignity, which all human beings possess in one form or other,\nand in some, though by no means in exact, proportion to their higher\nfaculties …. (U II 6) \n\nGreen thinks that the dignity passage undermines hedonism\n(Prolegomena §§164–66, 171). In claiming that\nit is the dignity of a life in which the higher capacities are\nexercised and the competent judge’s sense of her own dignity that\nexplains her preference for those activities, Mill implies that her\npreferences reflect judgments about the value that these activities\nhave independently of their being the object of desire or the source of\npleasure. We take pleasure in these activities because they are\nvaluable; they are not valuable, because they are pleasurable. \n\nTo see Green’s point, think of competent judges as demi-gods. In the\ndignity passage, Mill is making the same sort of point that Socrates\ndoes in discussing Euthyphro’s definition of piety as what all the gods\nlove (Euthyphro 9c–11b). Socrates thought the gods’\nattitudes would be principled, not arbitrary. But this meant that their\nlove presupposed, rather than explained, piety and justice. Similarly,\nMill thinks that the preferences of competent judges are not arbitrary,\nbut principled, reflecting a sense of the value of the higher\ncapacities. But this would make his doctrine of higher pleasures\nfundamentally anti-hedonistic, insofar it explains the superiority of\nhigher activities, not in terms of the pleasure they produce, but\nrather in terms of the dignity or value of the kind of life\ncharacterized by the exercise of higher capacities. And it is\nsensitivity to the dignity of such a life that explains the categorical\npreference that competent judges supposedly have for higher\nactivities. \n\nWe can begin to see the possibility and the appeal of reading Mill\nas a kind of perfectionist about happiness, who claims that human\nhappiness consists in the proper exercise of those capacities essential\nto our nature. For instance, Mill suggests this sort of perfectionist\nperspective on happiness when early in On Liberty he describes\nthe utilitarian foundation of his defense of individual liberties. \n\nIt is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be\nderived to my argument from the idea of abstract right as a thing\nindependent of utility. I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all\nethical questions; but it must be utility in the largest sense,\ngrounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\n(OL I 11) \n\nMill apparently believes that the sense of dignity of a (properly\nself-conscious) progressive being would give rise to a categorical\npreference for activities that exercise his or her higher capacities.\nIn claiming that “it is better to be a human being dissatisfied\nthan a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool\nsatisfied” (U II 6), Mill recognizes capacities for\nself-examination and practical deliberation as among our higher\ncapacities. \n\nThis concern with self-examination and practical deliberation is, of\ncourse, a central theme in On Liberty. There he articulates\nthe interest that progressive beings have in reflective\ndecision-making. \n\nHe who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of\nlife for him has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of\nimitation. He who chooses his plan for himself employs all his\nfaculties. He must use observation to see, reasoning and judgment to\nforesee, activity to gather materials for decision, discrimination to\ndecide, and when he has decided, firmness and self-control to hold his\ndeliberate decision. And these qualities he requires and exercises\nexactly in proportion as the part of his conduct which he determines\naccording to his own judgment and feelings is a large one. It is\npossible that he might be guided in some good path, and kept out of\nharm’s way, without any of these things. But what will be his\ncomparative worth as a human being? (OL III 4) \n\nEven if we agree that these deliberative capacities are unique to\nhumans or that humans possess them to a higher degree than other\ncreatures, we might wonder in what way their possession marks us as\nprogressive beings or their exercise is important to human\nhappiness. \n\nIn his discussion of responsibility in A System of Logic\n(SL VI.ii.1–4) Mill suggests that he thinks that humans are\nresponsible agents and that this is what marks us as progressive\nbeings. There he claims that capacities for practical deliberation are\nnecessary for responsibility. In particular, he claims that moral\nresponsibility involves a kind of self-mastery or self-governance in\nwhich one can can deliberate about the appropriateness of one’s desires\nand regulate one’s actions according to these deliberations\n(SL VI.ii.3). If this is right, then Mill can claim that\npossession and use of our deliberative capacities mark us as\nprogressive beings, because they are what mark as moral agents who are\nresponsible. If our happiness should reflect the sort of beings we are,\nMill can argue that higher activities that exercise these deliberative\ncapacities form the principal or most important ingredient in human\nhappiness. \n\nWhere exactly does this recognition of perfectionist elements in\nMill’s conception of happiness leave us? Any interpretation faces\nsignificant worries about his consistency. Part of the problem is that\nMill appears to endorse three distinct conceptions of the good and\nhappiness. \n\nHedonism is apparently introduced in the Proportionality Doctrine,\nwhen Mill identifies happiness and pleasure (U II 2). In\nintroducing the doctrine of higher pleasures, Mill appears to want to\nmake some refinement within hedonism (II 3–5). But the higher\npleasures doctrine appeals to the informed or idealized preferences of\na competent judge and identifies higher pleasures with the object of\ntheir preferences (II 5). Moreover, he treats this appeal to the\npreferences of competent judges as final (II 8). But competent judges\nprefer higher activities, and not just subjective pleasures caused by\nthose activities, and their preference for higher pursuits is based on\ntheir sense of the dignity inherent in a life lived that way (II 6).\nMoreover, in On Liberty and elsewhere he embraces a\n“progressive” conception of happiness in terms of\nreflective self-examination and directive self-control. Since these are\nthree distinct and rival claims about Mill’s conception of the final\ngood, any reading must explain away inconsistency as best it can and\nsay something about how these three elements are to be reconciled with\none another. \n\nWe could reconcile either hedonism or perfectionism with the\ndesire-satisfaction claim if we treat the latter as a metaethical claim\nabout what makes good things good and the former as a substantive claim\nabout what things are good. On this reading, what makes something good\nis that it would be preferred by competent judges, and what competent\njudges in fact prefer is pleasures, especially higher pleasures\n(according to the hedonist claim) or higher activities and pursuits\n(according to the perfectionist claim). But, as we have seen, neither\nof these claims can accommodate all of Mill’s claims about happiness,\nand both assume that the preferences of competent judges are\nconstitutive of the superiority of the object of the their preferences.\nBut the dignity passage implies that the preferences of competent\njudges are evidential, rather than constitutive, of the value of the\nobject of the their preferences. \n\nThe perfectionist reading offers one reconciliation of Mill’s\ndisparate claims. It says that happiness consists in the exercise of\nhigher capacities, that the preferences of competent judges are\nevidential of superior value, and that higher pleasures are objective\npleasures. There is no doubt that his initial formulation of his\nconception of happiness in terms of pleasure misleadingly leads us to\nexpect greater continuity between his own brand of utilitarianism and\nthe hedonistic utilitarianism of the Radicals than we actually find.\nHowever, this perfectionist interpretation seems to afford the most\nconsistent reading of Mill’s disparate claims about happiness\n(also see Saunders 2017). \n\nAs Mill’s Proportionality Doctrine makes clear, he endorses the\nutilitarian idea that duty or right action is to be defined in terms of\nthe promotion of happiness. But exactly how Mill thinks duty is related\nto happiness is not entirely clear. To understand the different strands\nin his conception of utilitarianism, we need to distinguish between\ndirect and indirect utilitarianism. \n\nSo formulated, direct and indirect utilitarianism are general\ntheories that apply to any object of moral assessment. But our focus\nhere is on right action or duty. Act utilitarianism is the most\nfamiliar form of direct utilitarianism applied to action, whereas the\nmost common indirect utilitarian theory of duty is rule\nutilitarianism. \n\nThis conception of act utilitarianism is both maximizing,\nbecause it identifies the right action with the best available action,\nand scalar, because it recognizes that rightness can come in\ndegrees, depending on the action’s proximity to the best (contrast\nNorcross 2008). The right act is the optimal act, but some suboptimal\nacts can be more right and less wrong than others. Similarly, this\nconception of rule utilitarianism assesses rules in both maximizing and\nscalar fashion. \n\nWe might expect a utilitarian to apply the utilitarian principle in\nher deliberations. Consider act utilitarianism. We might expect such a\nutilitarian to be motivated by pure disinterested benevolence and to\ndeliberate by calculating expected utility. But it is a practical\nquestion how to reason or be motivated, and act utilitarianism implies\nthat this practical question, like all practical questions, is\ncorrectly answered by what would maximize utility. Utilitarian\ncalculation is time-consuming and often unreliable or subject to bias\nand distortion. For such reasons, we may better approximate the\nutilitarian standard if we don’t always try to approximate it. Mill\nsays that to suppose that one must always consciously employ the\nutilitarian principle in making decisions \n\n… is to mistake the very meaning of a standard of morals and\nconfound the rule of action with the motive of it. It is the business\nof ethics to tell us what are our duties, or by what test we may know\nthem; but no system of ethics requires that the sole motive of all we\ndo shall be a feeling of duty; on the contrary, ninety-nine hundredths\nof all our actions are done from other motives, and rightly so done if\nthe rule of duty does not condemn them. (U II 18) \n\nLater utilitarians, such as Sidgwick, have made essentially the same\npoint, insisting that utilitarianism provides a standard of\nright action, not necessarily a decision procedure\n(Methods 413). \n\nIf utilitarianism is itself the standard of right conduct, not a\ndecision procedure, then what sort of decision procedure should the\nutilitarian endorse, and what role should the principle of utility play\nin moral reasoning? As we will see, Mill thinks that much moral\nreasoning should be governed by secondary precepts or principles about\nsuch things as fidelity, fair play, and honesty that make no direct\nreference to utility but whose general observance does promote utility.\nThese secondary principles should be set aside in favor of direct\nappeals to the utilitarian first principle in cases in which adherence\nto the secondary precept would have obviously inferior consequences or\nin which such secondary principles conflict (U II 19,\n24–25). \n\nThe question that concerns us here is what kind of utilitarian\nstandard Mill endorses. Is he an act utilitarian, a rule utilitarian,\nor some other kind of indirect utilitarian? \n\nSeveral of Mill’s characterizations of utilitarianism endorse the\ndirect utilitarian claim that an action’s moral status is a function of\nits utility. Chapter II, we saw, is where Mill purports to say what the\ndoctrine of utilitarianism does and does not say. In the opening\nparagraph, he tells us that utilitarians are “those who stand up\nfor utility as the test of right and wrong” (II 1). According to\nthe Proportionality Doctrine, introduced in the next paragraph,\nutilitarianism holds “that actions are right in proportion as\nthey tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the\nreverse of happiness” (II 2). Later in that chapter, he says that\nit requires that “utility or happiness [be] considered as the\ndirective rule of human conduct” (II 8). Still later in Chapter\nII, he describes utilitarianism as a “standard of what is right\nin conduct” (II 17). Even Chapter V, which will eventually\nintroduce some indirect elements, begins with Mill asserting that\nutilitarianism is “the doctrine that utility or happiness is the\ncriterion of right and wrong” (V 1). \n\nBut not everyone agrees. J.O. Urmson famously defended a rule\nutilitarian reading of Mill (1953). One of Urmson’s reasons for this\nrule utilitarian reading appeals to Mill’s reliance on various rules\nand secondary principles in moral reasoning. We will examine that\nrationale shortly. But Urmson also appeals to the Proportionality\nDoctrine as requiring a rule utilitarian interpretation of Mill. \n\nRecall that the Proportionality Doctrine says, in part, that\nutilitarianism holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend\nto promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of\nhappiness (U II 2). Urmson claims that we can make sense of an\naction’s tendency to produce good or bad consequences only as a claim\nabout what is true of a class or type of actions.\nToken actions produce specifiable consequences; only types of actions\nhave tendencies. On Urmson’s interpretation, Mill is really saying that\nan action is right if it is a token of a type of act that tends to have\ngood or optimal consequences. So interpreted, the Proportionality\nDoctrine would espouse a form of rule utilitarianism. \n\nBut it was common among the Philosophical Radicals to formulate\nutilitarianism, as the Proportionality Doctrine does, in terms of the\nfelicific tendencies of individual actions. For instance, Bentham does\nthis early in his Introduction to the Principles of Morals and\nLegislation. \n\nBy the principle of utility is meant that principle which approves\nor disapproves of every action whatsoever, according to the tendency\nwhich it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the\nparty whose interest is in question: or, what is the same thing in\nother words, to promote or oppose that happiness. I say of every action\nwhatsoever; and therefore not only every action of a private\nindividual, but of every measure of government. (I 2; also see I\n3, 6) \n\nHere and elsewhere, Bentham clearly ascribes the felicific tendency\nto action tokens, and he equates an action’s felicific tendency with\nthe extent to which it promotes utility. \n\nThe general tendency of an act is more or less pernicious, according\nto the sum total of its consequences: that is, according to the\ndifferences between the sum of such as are good, and the sum of such as\nare evil. (VII 2; also see IV 5) \n\nIf we interpret Mill’s Proportionality Doctrine against the\nbackground of similar claims made by Bentham, this is evidence against\nUrmson’s reading and in favor of an act utilitarian reading of the\nProportionality Doctrine (see Berger 1984: 73–78). \n\nUrmson also defends a rule utilitarian interpretation as a reading\nof Mill’s claims about the importance of secondary principles in our\nmoral reasoning. Mill defends the utilitarian’s appeal to familiar\nmoral precepts about such things as fidelity, veracity, and fair play\nas secondary principles that should regulate much moral reasoning\n(U II 24–25). He seems to believe that secondary\nprinciples often satisfy two conditions. \n\nWhen these two conditions are met, Mill believes, agents should for\nthe most part follow these principles automatically and without\nrecourse to the utilitarian first principle. However, they should\nperiodically step back and review, as best they can, whether the\nprinciple continues to satisfy conditions (1) and (2). Also, they\nshould set aside these secondary principles and make direct appeal to\nthe principle of utility in unusual cases in which it is especially\nclear that the effects of adhering to the principle would be\nsubstantially suboptimal and in cases in which secondary principles,\neach of which has a utilitarian justification, conflict (II 19,\n24–25). \n\nRegulating one’s behavior in this way by secondary principles, Mill\nbelieves, is what will best promote happiness, as he explains in A\nSystem of Logic. \n\nI do not mean to assert that the promotion of happiness should be\nitself the end of all actions, or even all rules of action. It is the\njustification, and ought to be the controller, of all ends, but it is\nnot itself the sole end. There are many virtuous actions, and even\nvirtuous modes of action (though the cases are, I think, less frequent\nthan is often supposed) by which happiness in the particular instance\nis sacrificed, more pain being produced than pleasure. But conduct of\nwhich this can be truly asserted, admits of justification only because\nit can be shown that on the whole more happiness will exist in the\nworld, if feelings are cultivated which will make people, in certain\ncases, regardless of happiness. (SL VI.xii.7) \n\nHe makes similar claims in his essay “On Bentham”\n(CW X: 110–11). \n\nMill’s utilitarian justification of secondary principles is intended\nas a contrast with the intuitionism of William Whewell and others. As\nhe makes clear in his essay “Whewell on Moral\nPhilosophy”(CW X), Mill thinks that the intuitionist\nwrongly treats familiar moral precepts as ultimate moral factors whose\njustification is supposed to be self-evident. By contrast, Mill’s\naccount of secondary principles recognizes their importance in moral\nreasoning but insists that they are neither innate nor infallible; they\nare precepts that have been adopted and internalized because of their\nacceptance value, and their continued use should be suitably regulated\nby their ongoing comparative acceptance value. Far from undermining\nutilitarian first principles, Mill thinks, appeal to the importance of\nsuch moral principles actually provides support for utilitarianism. \n\nWhether Mill’s claims about the importance of secondary principles\nimply rule utilitarianism depends, in part, on whether he wants to\ndefine right action in terms of the best set of secondary principles or\nwhether they are just a reliable way of doing what is in fact best. If\nhe defines right action in terms of conformity with principles with\noptimal acceptance value, then he is a rule utilitarian. But if the\nright action is the best action, and secondary principles are just a\nreliable (though imperfect) way of identifying what is best, then Mill\nis an act utilitarian. Mill appears to address this issue in two\nplaces. In Chapter II of Utilitarianism Mill appears to\nsuggest that in the case of abstinences or taboos the ground of the\nobligation in particular cases is the beneficial character of the taboo\nconsidered as a class (II 19). But in a letter to John Venn Mill claims\nthat the moral status of an individual action depends on the utility of\nits consequences; considerations about the utility of a general class\nof actions are just defeasible evidence about what is true in\nparticular cases (CW XVII: 1881). Unfortunately, natural\nreadings of the two passages point in opposite directions on this\nissue, and each passage admits of alternative readings. \n\nWithout clear support for the rule utilitarian reading of secondary\nprinciples, it seems that Mill’s main claims about secondary principles\nare not inconsistent with act utilitarianism. Moreover, it is clear\nthat Mill thinks we need to depart from otherwise justified secondary\nprinciples in an important range of cases. Though Mill does not treat\nsecondary principles as mere rules of thumb in utilitarian calculation,\nhe does not think that they should be followed uncritically or\nindependently of their consequences. He thinks that they should be set\naside in favor of direct appeal to the principle of utility when\nfollowing them would be clearly suboptimal or when there is a conflict\namong secondary principles. \n\nSo far, Mill’s various claims about duty are largely consistent with\ndirect utilitarianism, and, hence, act utilitarianism. However, Chapter\nV of Utilitarianism introduces claims about duty, justice, and\nrights that are hard to square with either. \n\nFor the truth is, that the idea of penal sanction, which is the\nessence of law, enters not only into the conception of injustice, but\ninto that of any kind of wrong. We do not call anything wrong unless we\nmean to imply that a person ought to be punished in some way or other\nfor doing it—if not by law, by the opinion of his fellow\ncreatures; if not by opinion, by the reproaches of his own conscience.\nThis seems the real turning point of the distinction between morality\nand simple expediency. (V 14) \n\nHere Mill defines wrongness and, by implication, duty, not directly\nin terms of the nature of the action or its consequences but indirectly\nin terms of appropriate responses to it. He appears to believe that one\nis under an obligation or duty to do something just in case failure to\ndo it is wrong and that an action is wrong just in case some kind of\nexternal or internal sanction—punishment, social censure, or\nself-reproach—ought to be applied to its performance. This test\ndistinguishes duty from expediency (V 14, 15). Not all suboptimal or\ninexpedient acts are wrong, only those to which one ought to apply some\nsort of sanction (at least, self-reproach). \n\nJustice is a proper part of duty. Justice involves duties that are\nperfect duties—that is, duties that are correlated with rights (V\n15). An act is just if and only if it is not unjust, and it is unjust\njust in case it is wrong and violates someone’s rights (V 23). Someone\nhas a right just in case she has a claim that society ought to protect\nby force of law or public opinion (V 24). \n\nNotice that these relationships among duty, justice, and rights do\nnot yet introduce any utilitarian elements. But Mill does think that\nwhether sanctions ought to be applied to an action—and hence\nwhether it is wrong—and whether society ought to enforce an\nindividual’s claim—and hence whether she has a right—both\ndepend upon the utility or expediency of doing so (V 25). He does not\nsay precisely what standard of expediency he has in mind. In\nparticular, he does not say whether the relevant test for whether\nsomething is wrong requires that sanctions be optimal or merely\nbeneficial. To fix ideas, let us assume that an action is wrong if and\nonly if it is optimal to sanction it. \n\nBecause this account of duty defines the rightness and wrongness of\nan act, not in terms of its utility, as act utilitarianism does, but in\nterms of the utility of applying sanctions to the conduct, it is an\nindirect form of utilitarianism. Because justice is a species of duty,\nit inherits this indirect character (also see Lyons 1994). Because it\nmakes the deontic status of conduct depend upon the utility of\nsanctioning that conduct in some way, we might call this conception of\nduty, justice, and rights sanction utilitarianism. Because\nsanction utilitarianism is a species of indirect utilitarianism, it is\ninconsistent with act utilitarianism. The introduction of indirect\nutilitarian ideas in Chapter V of Utilitarianism into an\naccount of utilitarianism that otherwise looks act utilitarian reveals\na fundamental tension in Mill’s thought about duty. \n\nGiven Mill’s ambivalence between direct and indirect utilitarianism,\nit is natural to inquire whether one view is more plausible than the\nother. Some of Mill’s claims in Chapter V suggest a possible advantage\nthat sanction utilitarianism might have. In articulating sanction\nutilitarianism, Mill claims that it allows him to distinguish duty and\nexpediency and claim that not all inexpedient acts are wrong;\ninexpedient acts are only wrong when it is good or optimal to sanction\nthem. This suggests that sanction utilitarianism may be preferable to\nact utilitarianism, because it has a more plausible account of the\nrelation among different deontic categories. \n\nCommonsense moral thinking recognizes a familiar fourfold deontic\ndistinction. \n\nThe act utilitarian seems unable to account for this fourfold\ndistinction. It implies that I do wrong every time I fail to perform\nthe optimal act, even when these suboptimal acts are very good. Because\nit makes the optimal obligatory and the suboptimal wrong, it appears to\nexpand the domain of the forbidden, collapse the distinction between\nthe permissible and the obligatory, and make no room for the\nsupererogatory. If the optimal is already one’s duty, there appears to\nbe no room for the supererogatory. By contrast, sanction utilitarianism\ndoes not appear to have these problems. It offers a distinct account of\neach category. \n\nIn this way, sanction utilitarianism appears to respect this common\ndeontic categorization and, in particular, to make room for the\nsupererogatory. \n\nHowever, the direct utilitarian can and should distinguish between\nthe moral assessment of an act and the moral assessment of the act of\npraising or blaming that act. Each should be assessed, the direct\nutilitarian claims, by the utility of doing so. But then it is possible\nfor there to be wrongdoing (a suboptimal act) that is blameless or even\npraiseworthy. But then the direct utilitarian can appeal to the same\ndistinctions among praiseworthiness and blameworthiness that the\nsanction utilitarian appeals to, while denying that her own deontic\ndistinctions track blame and praise. So, for instance, there can be\nacts that are wrong, because suboptimal, that it would nonetheless be\nwrong to blame, because this would be suboptimal. If so, it is unclear\nthat sanction utilitarianism enjoys any real advantage here over act\nutilitarianism. \n\nMoreover, sanction utilitarianism appears to have disadvantages that\nact utilitarianism does not. One such problem derives from its\nhybrid structure. Sanction utilitarianism is impurely\nindirect. For while it provides an indirect utilitarian theory of duty,\nthe account it provides of when sanctions should be applied to conduct\nis direct—it depends upon the consequences of applying sanctions.\nSanction utilitarianism provides an indirect utilitarian account of the\nconditions under which an action—any action—is right or\nwrong. This general criterion is that any action is wrong to which one\nought to attach sanctions. But imposing sanctions is a kind of action,\nand we can ask whether the imposition of a particular sanction would be\nright or wrong. The general criterion implies that we should answer\nthis question about the rightness of applying sanctions in\nsanction-utilitarians terms, namely, by asking whether it would be\nright to sanction the failure to apply sanctions. This introduces a\nsecond-order sanction, whose rightness we can now ask about. We seem to\nbe off on an infinite regress of sanctions. Sanction-utilitarianism\navoids the regress because it provides a direct utilitarian answer to\nthe question when to apply the first-order sanction. It says that a\nsanction should be applied iff doing so is optimal. Though this avoids\na regress, it appears to render sanction utilitarianism internally\ninconsistent. \n\n(2) is inconsistent with (1). \n\nThe different strands in Mill’s utilitarian conception of duty\nrequire disentangling. In his central exposition of the utilitarian\nstandard in Chapter II, Mill commits himself to act utilitarianism in\nmultiple passages. In that same chapter, he focuses on the felicific\ntendencies of actions and assigns a significant role to rules within\nmoral reasoning, both of which have been taken to commit him to a rule\nutilitarian doctrine. However, these claims are reconcilable with\ndirect utilitarianism and so provide no good reason to depart from a\ntraditional act utilitarian reading of that chapter. But in Chapter V\nMill does introduce indirect utilitarian ideas in the doctrine of\nsanction utilitarianism. It is hard to reconcile these direct and\nindirect elements in Mill’s conception of duty. \n\nWe have focused so far on understanding Mill’s version of\nutilitarianism, especially his conceptions of happiness and duty. Now\nwe should consider his justification of utilitarianism, which he offers\nin his discussion of the “proof” of the principle of\nutility in Chapter IV. Mill claims that the utilitarian must claim that\nhappiness is the one and only thing desirable in itself (IV 2). He\nclaims that the only proof of desirability is desire and proceeds to\nargue that happiness is the one and only thing desired. He argues that\na person does desire his own happiness for its own sake and that,\ntherefore, happiness as such is desired by and desirable for its own\nsake for humanity as a whole (“The aggregate of all\npersons”) (IV 3). He then turns to defend the claim that\nhappiness is the only thing desirable in itself, by arguing that\napparent counterexamples (e.g., desires for virtue for its own sake)\nare not inconsistent with his claim (IV 5–8). \n\nOne traditional reconstruction of Mill’s proof might look something\nlike this. \n\nThe proof has, at least in some quarters, threatened Mill’s\nreputation as a careful philosopher. Here is a partial list of concerns\nabout Mill’s argument, as traditionally conceived. \n\nThese are all serious worries about Mill’s proof, as traditionally\nconceived. These objections seem so serious and so obvious that they\nshould make us wonder if there is a more plausible interpretation of\nhis proof. \n\nFor one thing, Mill need not confuse desire and desirability. He\nrecognizes that they are distinct, but says that desire is our only\nproof of desirability (IV 3). In saying this, he need not presuppose\nthat desiring something confers value on (obtaining) it. Our desires\noften reflect value judgments we make, explicitly or implicitly. If so,\nour desires will be evidence of what we regard as valuable, and our\nreflectively acceptable desires may provide our best defeasible test of\nwhat things are objectively valuable. \n\nMill first applies this test to what each of us desires for her own\nsake. His answer is that what each of us desires for her own sake is\nhappiness (IV 3). We needn’t interpret Mill as endorsing psychological\negoism at this point. Rather, he is saying when each of us\ndoes focus on her own ends or sake, we find that each cares about her\nown happiness. Another way to put Mill’s point is that prudential\nconcern focuses on the agent’s happiness. \n\nMill goes on to say that just as each person’s own happiness is a\ngood to that person, so too happiness, as such, is a good to the\naggregate of persons. But we need not suppose that Mill is attributing\na psychology, much less an egoist psychology, to humanity as a group.\nInstead, we can read Mill as claiming that just as the agent’s own\nhappiness is the object of prudential concern, so too happiness as such\nis the proper object of disinterested or impartial concern. \n\nOn this reading, Mill is not trying to derive utilitarianism from\negoism (see Hall 1949). Rather, he is assuming that the moral point of\nview is impartial in a way that prudence is not. Just as prudence aims\nat the agent’s own happiness, so too, Mill thinks, morality, which is\nimpartial, aims at happiness as such. On this reading, the structure of\nMill’s proof looks something like this. \n\nIf this is the right way to understand Mill’s proof, then his\njustification of utilitarianism consists in assuming that the moral\npoint of view is impartial and claiming that utilitarianism is the\nright way to understand impartiality. Morality is impartial, and\nimpartiality requires taking everyone’s interests into\naccount—and not just those of some select few—and weighing\nthem equally—and not with a thumb in the scales for some select\nfew. Indeed, later, in Chapter V, Mill identifies impartiality and its\nprogressive demands with both justice and morality. \n\nIt [impartiality] is involved in the very meaning of Utility, or the\nGreatest-Happiness Principle. That principle is a mere form of words\nwithout rational signification, unless one person’s happiness, supposed\nequal in degree (with the proper allowance made for kind), is counted\nfor exactly as much as another’s. Those conditions being supplied,\nBentham’s dictum ‘everybody to count for one, nobody for more\nthan one,’ might be written under the principle of utility as an\nexplanatory commentary. The equal claim of everybody to happiness in\nthe estimation of the moralist and the legislator involves an equal\nclaim to all the means of happiness …. And hence all social\ninequalities which have ceased to be considered expedient, assume the\ncharacter not of simple inexpediency, but of injustice. The entire\nhistory of social improvement has been a series of transitions, by\nwhich one custom or institution after another, from being supposed a\nprimary necessity of social existence, has passed into the rank of\nuniversally stigmatized injustice and tyranny. So it has been with the\ndistinctions of slaves and freemen, nobles and serfs, patricians and\nplebeians; and so it will be, and in part already is, with the\naristocracies of colour, race, and sex. (V 36) \n\nHere we see Mill identifying utilitarian impartiality with the\ndemands of justice and morality itself (also see Crisp 1997:\n79–80). \n\nOne might wonder if utilitarianism is the only or the best way to\nunderstand impartiality. Indeed, this is one way of understanding now\nfamiliar worries about the implications of utilitarianism for issues of\ndistributive justice and individual rights. But this reading of the\nproof has the virtue of identifying Mill’s defense of utilitarianism\nwith the feature of it that made it a progressive influence\nhistorically. \n\nIn Chapter III of Utilitarianism Mill addresses the\nquestion of the ultimate sanction of the principle of utility. He\nunderstands this alternately as a question about “the motives to\nobey it” and the “source of its obligation … [or]\nbinding force” (III 1). Mill recognizes a potential worry about\nthe sanctions of utilitarianism that apparently has its source in\nprudence or self-interest. \n\nHe [an agent] says to himself, I feel that I am bound not to rob or\nmurder, betray or deceive; but why am I bound to promote the general\nhappiness? If my own happiness lies in something else, why may I not\ngive that the preference? (III 1) \n\nBut this worry about potential conflicts between the agent’s own\ninterests and utilitarian moral demands seems to arise for any\nconception of morality that recognizes other-regarding moral demands.\nFor this reason, Mill seems to think that it poses no special problem\nfor utilitarianism (III 1, 2, 3, 6). \n\nIs Mill right that there is no special threat to utilitarianism\nhere? One might wonder whether utilitarianism makes greater demands on\nagents than other moral theories. Contemporary writers have argued that\nutilitarianism seems to be potentially very demanding, much more so\nthan commonsense morality. For instance, reformist utilitarians, such\nas Peter Singer (1972), have argued that utilitarianism entails\nextensive duties of mutual aid that would call for significant changes\nin the lifestyles of all those who are even moderately well off. And\ncritics of utilitarianism have treated the demandingness of\nutilitarianism as one of its principal flaws. Rawls (1971) has argued\nthat the sort of interpersonal sacrifice that utilitarianism requires\nviolates the strains of commitment in a well-ordered society. And\nBernard Williams (1973) has argued that the demandingness of\nutilitarianism threatens the sort of personal projects and partial\nrelationships that help give our lives meaning. The common complaint\nhere is that utilitarianism’s demands threaten to offend against a\nrequirement of psychological realism, according to which the\ndemands of an acceptable moral theory must be ones that can be\nincorporated into a reasonable and satisfying life plan. \n\nThis worry about the demands of utilitarianism is not easy to\nassess. One might wonder how to interpret and whether to accept the\npsychological realist constraint. If the constraint is relative to\npeople’s actual psychologies, then it represents a potentially\nconservative constraint on moral theorizing that one might well reject.\nIf the constraint is relative to possible or ideal psychology, then it\nis not clear that even a highly revisionary moral theory need flout the\nconstraint. Then there is a question about how demanding or revisionary\nutilitarianism actually is. Mill and Sidgwick thought that our\nknowledge of others and our causal powers to do good were limited to\nthose near and dear and other associates with whom we have regular\ncontact, with the result that as individuals we do better overall by\nfocusing our energies and actions on associates of one kind or another,\nrather than the world at large (U II 19; Sidgwick,\nMethods 361–69). On this view, utilitarianism can\naccommodate the sort of special obligations and personal concerns to\nwhich the critics of utilitarianism appeal. But it is arguable that\neven if this sort of utilitarian accommodation was tenable in\nnineteenth century Britain, technological development and globalization\nhave rendered utilitarian demands more revisionary. Our information\nabout others and our causal reach are not limited as they once were.\nGiven the high benefit-to-cost ratio of many modern relief agencies, it\nis hard to resist something like Singer’s conclusions about the\nreformist demands of utilitarianism. So even if Mill was right to think\nthat the motivational demands of utilitarianism were not so different\nfrom those of other moral theories at the time he wrote, that claim\nmight need to be reassessed today. \n\nMill’s On Liberty is the most influential statement of his\nliberal principles. He begins by distinguishing old and new threats to\nliberty. The old threat to liberty is found in traditional societies in\nwhich there is rule by one (a monarchy) or a few (an aristocracy).\nThough one could be worried about restrictions on liberty by benevolent\nmonarchs or aristocrats, the traditional worry is that when rulers are\npolitically unaccountable to the governed they will rule in their own\ninterests, rather than the interests of the governed. In particular,\nthey will restrict the liberties of their subjects in ways that benefit\nthemselves, rather than the ruled. It was these traditional threats to\nliberty that the democratic reforms of the Philosophical Radicals were\nmeant to address. But Mill thinks that these traditional threats to\nliberty are not the only ones to worry about. He makes clear that\ndemocracies contain their own threats to liberty—this is the\ntyranny, not of the one or the few, but of the majority (OL I\n1–5). Mill sets out to articulate the principles that should\nregulate how governments and societies, whether democratic or not, can\nrestrict individual liberties (I 6). \n\nIn an early and famous passage Mill conceives of liberalism in terms\nof “one very simple principle.” \n\nThe object of this essay is to assert one very simple principle, as\nentitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the\nindividual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used\nbe physical force in the form of legal penalties or the moral coercion\nof public opinion. That principle is that the sole end for which\nmankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering\nwith the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\nThat the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over\nany member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent\nharm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a\nsufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear\nbecause it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him\nhappier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise or\neven right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or\nreasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for\ncompelling him or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise.\nTo justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must\nbe calculated to produce evil to someone else. The only part of the\nconduct of anyone for which he is amenable to society is that which\nconcerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his\nindependence, is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body\nand mind, the individual is sovereign. (I 9) \n\nIn this passage, Mill distinguishes paternalistic and moralistic\nrestrictions of liberty from restrictions of liberty based upon the\nharm principle and claims that the harm prevention is the sole\nlegitimate basis for restricting individual liberties. \n\nLater, Mill distinguishes between genuine harm and mere\noffense. In order to satisfy the harm principle, an action must\nviolate or risk violation of those important interests of others in\nwhich they have a right (I 12; III 1; IV 3, 10; IV 12; V 5). \n\nThese distinctions allow Mill to defend a categorical\napproach to liberal rights. To decide whether an individual’s\nliberty ought to be protected, we must ascertain to which category the\npotential restriction of liberty belongs: offense, moralism,\npaternalism, and harm prevention. Mill seems to permit or forbid\nrestrictions on liberty by category, claiming that the only\nrestrictions that are permissible involve harm prevention. Of course, a\ngiven regulation might fall under more than one category. Many\nprovisions of the criminal law, such as prohibitions on murder and\nassault, might be designed both to enforce fundamental moral provisions\nand to prevent harm to others. Mill does not object to moralistic or\npaternalistic legislation that can also be defended by appeal to the\nharm principle. Rather, the objection is to restrictions that can only\nbe justified in these ways and cannot be justified by appeal to harm\nprevention. \n\nHarm prevention is a necessary but not sufficient ground for\nrestricting individual liberties. Harm prevention is sufficient to\nestablish a pro tanto case for regulation (I 11), but whether\nregulation is all things considered appropriate depends on a\nutilitarian calculation of whether the benefits of regulation exceed\nits costs. \n\nAs soon as any part of a person’s conduct affects prejudicially the\ninterests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question\nwhether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering\nwith it, becomes open to discussion. (IV 3) \n\nThis means that the harm principle is not in fact Mill’s only\nprinciple, because we cannot decide whether regulations that would\nprevent harm should be adopted without appealing to the principle of\nutility. But even if harm prevention is not sufficient to justify\nrestricting liberty, Mill does appear to claim that it is\nnecessary. \n\nSometimes Mill suggests that the harm principle is equivalent to\nletting society restrict other-regarding conduct (I 11; IV 2). On this\nview, conduct can be divided into self-regarding and other-regarding\nconduct. Regulation of the former is paternalistic, and regulation of\nthe latter is an application of the harm principle. So on this view it\nis never permissible to regulate purely self-regarding conduct and\nalways permissible to regulate other-regarding conflict. But, as Mill\nhimself concedes, very little conduct is purely self-regarding (IV 8).\nSome other-regarding conduct causes mere offense, not genuine harm (IV\n3; IV 12). So Mill cannot equate harmful behavior and other-regarding\nbehavior and cannot think that all other-regarding behavior may be\nregulated. \n\nIt is generally thought that by applying this categorical approach\nto liberty and its permissible restrictions Mill is led to offer a\nfairly extensive defense of individual liberties against interference\nby the state and society. In particular, it is sometimes thought that\nMill recognizes a large sphere of conduct which it is impermissible for\nthe state to regulate. We might characterize this sphere of protected\nliberties as Mill’s conception of liberal rights. On this\nreading, Mill is deriving his conception of liberal rights from a prior\ncommitment to the categorical approach and, in particular, to the harm\nprinciple (see Jacobson 2000 for an alternative reading). \n\nThere is an apparent tension between Mill’s commitment to a\ncategorical approach to basic liberties and his defense of\nutilitarianism. Utilitarianism treats the good as prior to and\nindependent of the right or duty—defining duty as the promotion\nof good consequences. Perhaps certain kinds of actions tend to be good\nor bad, but, according to direct utilitarianism, the moral quality of a\nparticular action depends on its own consequences. By contrast, the\ndeontological and natural rights traditions treat duty or the right as\nprior to and independent of the good. In particular, deontologists\nbelieve that it is not always one’s duty to promote good consequences.\nSometimes one has a duty to do an act that is suboptimal, and sometimes\nit is wrong to do the optimal act. Deontologists recognize moral\nconstraints on pursuing the good. These constraints usually\ntake the form of categorical rules to perform or refrain from\ncertain sorts of actions (e.g., to keep promises or to refrain from\nlying), regardless of the consequences. A special case of this\nperceived conflict between categorical rules and utility is the\nperceived tension between utility and rights. For, on a common\nview, individual rights just are a special case of categorical rules.\nIndividual rights, such as rights to liberties or to freedom from harm,\nare interpreted as “trumps” or “side\nconstraints” on the pursuit of good consequences (Dworkin 1977:\nxi, 184–205; Nozick 1974: 28–35). \n\nThe apparent conflict between utility and rights poses an\ninteresting test for Mill, because he wants to defend liberal rights\nthat have utilitarian foundations. \n\nIt is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be\nderived to my argument from the idea of abstract right as a thing\nindependent of utility. I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all\nethical questions; but it must be utility in the largest sense,\ngrounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\n(OL I 11) \n\nWe need to ask if Mill is able to reconcile his defense of utility\nand liberty without compromising either his utilitarianism or his\ndefense of a right to liberties. \n\nMill begins his defense of basic liberties with a discussion of\nfreedom of expression. He thinks that there is general agreement on the\nimportance of free speech and that, once the grounds for free speech\nare understood, this agreement can be exploited to support a more\ngeneral defense of individual liberties (I 16; III 1). So his defense\nof expressive liberties is important not only in its own right but also\ninsofar as it lays the foundation of his liberal principles. \n\nMill’s discussion of censorship in Chapter II focuses on censorship\nwhose aim is to suppress false or immoral opinion (II 1–2). He\nmentions four reasons for maintaining free speech and opposing\ncensorship. \n\nIt is natural to group these four considerations into two main\nkinds: the first two invoke a truth-tracking defense of expressive\nliberties, while the second two appeal to a distinctive kind of value\nthat free discussion is supposed to have. \n\nThe first two claims represent freedom of expression as\ninstrumentally valuable; it is valuable, not in itself, but as the most\nreliable means of producing something else that Mill assumes is\nvaluable (either extrinsically or intrinsically), namely, true belief.\nIt is not\nhard to see how true beliefs would possess at least instrumental value,\nif only because our actions, plans, and reasoning are likely to be more\nsuccessful when based on true beliefs. Of course, the most reliable\nmeans of promoting true belief would be to believe everything. But that\nwould bring a great deal of false belief along too. A more plausible\ngoal to promote would be something like the ratio of true belief to\nfalse belief. Freedom of expression might then be defended as a more\nreliable policy for promoting the ratio of true belief to false belief\nthan a policy of censorship. This rationale for freedom of expression\nis echoed by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in his famous dissent in\nAbrams v. United States (1919) when he claims that the best\ntest of truth is free trade in the marketplace of ideas. \n\nNotice that this instrumental defense of freedom of expression does\nnot require the mistaken assumption that the censor must assume his own\ninfallibility (OL II 3). The censor can recognize that he\nmight be mistaken, but insist that he must act on the best available\nevidence about what is true. \n\nThis instrumental rationale may justify freedom of expression in\npreference to a policy of censorship whenever the censor finds the\nbeliefs in question implausible or offensive. But it does not justify\nfreedom of expression in preference to more conservative forms of\ncensorship. If the question is what policies are likely to increase the\nratio of true to false belief, we would seem to be justified in\ncensoring opinions for whose falsity there is especially clear,\ncompelling, and consistent or stable evidence. We would be on good\nground in censoring flat-earthers (both literal and figurative). \n\nAnother way to see the weakness of the truth-tracking justification\nof freedom of expression is to notice that this instrumental defense of\nfreedom of expression cannot explain what is wrong with censorship that\nis successful in truth-tracking terms. Suppose we lived in a society of\nthe sort Plato imagines in the Republic in which cognitive\ncapacities are distributed unequally between rulers and citizens and in\nwhich maximally knowledgeable and reliable censors—call them\n“philosopher kings”—censor all and only false\nbeliefs. The truth-tracking argument would provide no argument against\ncensorship in such circumstances. This shows that the truth-tracking\nargument condemns only unsuccessful or incompetent\ncensorship. For some, this may be the biggest worry about censorship.\nBut many would have residual worries about successful or\ncompetent censorship. They would object to censorship, even by\nphilosopher-kings. Answering this worry requires a more robust defense\nof expressive liberties. \n\nThe resources for a more robust defense of freedom of expression can\nbe found in Mill’s claim that it is needed to keep true beliefs from\nbecoming dogmatic, because this reason for valuing freedom is intended\nto rebut the case for censorship even on the assumption that all and\nonly false beliefs would be censored (II 2, 21). \n\nMill’s claim that the value of freedom of expression lies in keeping\ntrue beliefs from becoming dogmatic reflects his view that freedoms of\nthought and discussion are necessary for fulfilling our natures as\nprogressive beings (OL II 20). For instance, Mill appeals to a\nfamiliar distinction between true belief, on the one hand, and\nknowledge, understood as something like justified true\nbelief, on the other hand (II 22; cf. Scanlon 1972; Ten 1980:\n126–28). Progressive beings seek knowledge or justified true\nbelief, and not simply true belief. Whereas the mere possession of true\nbeliefs need not exercise one’s deliberative capacities, because they\nmight be the product of indoctrination, their justification would. One\nexercises deliberative capacities in the justification of one’s beliefs\nand actions that is required for theoretical and practical knowledge.\nThis is because justification involves comparison of, and deliberation\namong, alternatives (II 6, 7, 8, 22–23, 43). Freedoms of thought\nand discussion are essential to the justification of one’s beliefs and\nactions, because individuals are not cognitively self-sufficient (II\n38, 39; III 1). Sharing thought and discussion with others, especially\nabout important matters, improves one’s deliberations. It enlarges the\nmenu of options, by identifying new options worth consideration, and\nhelps one better assess the merits of these options, by forcing on\none’s attention new considerations and arguments about the comparative\nmerits of the options. In these ways, open and vigorous discussion with\ndiverse interlocutors improves the quality of one’s deliberations. If\nso, censorship, even of false belief, can rob both those whose speech\nis suppressed and their audience of resources that they need to justify\ntheir beliefs and actions (II 1). \n\nThis deliberative rationale can explain why it is often wrong to\ncensor even false beliefs. In this way, Mill’s defense of expressive\nliberties that relies on his perfectionist appeal to deliberative\nvalues is a more robust defense than the one provided by his\ntruth-tracking arguments alone. \n\nThough important in its own right, Mill’s defense of freedom of\nthought and discussion provides the resources for a more general\ndefense of basic liberties of thought and action that Mill offers in\nthe balance of On Liberty. A good human life is one that\nexercises one’s higher capacities (I 11, 20; III 1–10); a\nperson’s higher capacities include her deliberative capacities, in\nparticular, capacities to form, revise, assess, select, and implement\nher own plan of life. This kind of self-government requires both\npositive and negative conditions. Among the positive conditions it\nrequires is an education that develops deliberative competence by\nproviding understanding of different historical periods and social\npossibilities, developing cultural and aesthetic sensibilities,\ndeveloping skills essential for critical reasoning and assessment, and\ncultivating habits of intellectual curiosity, modesty, and\nopen-mindedness (V 12–15). Among the negative conditions that\nself-government requires are various liberties of thought and action.\nIf the choice and pursuit of projects and plans is to be deliberate, it\nmust be informed as to the alternatives and their grounds, and this\nrequires intellectual freedoms of speech, association, and press that\nexpand the menu of deliberative options and allow for the vivid\nrepresentation of the comparative merits of options on that menu. If\nthere is to be choice and implementation of choices, there must be\nliberties of action such as freedom of association, freedom of worship,\nand freedom to choose one’s occupation. \n\nIndeed, liberties of thought and action are importantly related.\nThis is apparent in the pre-eminent value Mill assigns to diversity and\nexperimentation in life-style. Indeed, in his Autobiography\nMill describes this as the central truth of On Liberty: \n\nThe importance, to man and society, of a large variety in types of\ncharacter, and of giving full freedom to human nature to expand itself\nin innumerable and conflicting directions. (Autobiography\n259) \n\nDiversity and experimentation in life-style are important not only\ninsofar as they are expressions of self-government but also insofar as\nthey enhance self-government. For experimentation and diversity of\nlife-style expand the deliberative menu and bring out more clearly the\nnature and merits of options on the menu (OL II 23, 38; III\n1). \n\nDespite this robust rationale for liberties of thought and action,\nit is also important to see that Mill is not treating liberty as an\nintrinsic good or endorsing an unqualified right to liberty. \n\nFirst, we should note that Mill does not defend liberty per\nse, but only certain basic liberties. His defense focuses\non three basic categories of liberty (I 12). \n\nThough these liberties evidently include quite a bit, there is no\nsuggestion here that any and all liberty deserves protection. Why not?\nInsofar as Mill defends individual liberties by appeal to deliberative\nvalues, he can distinguish the importance of different liberties in\nterms of their role in practical deliberation. A central part of\npractical deliberation is forming ideals and regulating one’s actions\nand plans in accordance with these ideals. But some liberties seem more\ncentral than others to the selection of personal ideals. For instance,\nit seems plausible that liberties of speech, association, worship, and\nchoice of profession are more important than liberties to drive in\neither direction on streets designated as one-way, liberties not to\nwear seat belts, or liberties to dispose of one’s gross income as one\npleases, because restrictions on the former seem to interfere more than\nrestrictions on the latter with deliberations and choices about what\nsort of person to be. \n\nSecond, even the exercise of basic liberties is limited by the harm\nprinciple, which justifies restricting liberty to prevent harm to\nothers. Even expressive liberties can be restricted when their exercise\nposes a “clear and present danger” to others. \n\n[E]ven opinions lose their immunity when the circumstances in which\nthey are expressed are such as to constitute their expression a\npositive instigation to some mischievous act. An opinion that corn\ndealers are starvers of the poor, or that private property is robbery,\nought to be unmolested when simply circulated through the press, but\nmay justifiably incur punishment when delivered orally to an excited\nmob assembled before the house of a corn dealer, or when handed about\namong the same mob in the form of a placard. (III 1) \n\nThere are interesting questions about the correct interpretation of\nthe harm principle, which we will examine later. But Mill’s commitment\nto some version of the harm principle as a ground for restricting\nliberty is hard to dispute. \n\nThird, it is important to be clear about how Mill values basic\nliberties. To account for the robust character of his perfectionist\nargument, it is tempting to suppose that Mill thinks these basic\nliberties are themselves important intrinsic goods (see Berger 1984:\n41, 50, 199, 231–32; Bogen and Farrell 1978: 325–28). But\nin Mill’s introductory remarks he insists that his liberal principles\ndo not apply to individuals who do not have a suitably developed\nnormative competence (I 10). So, for instance, the prohibition on\npaternalism does not extend to children with immature deliberative\nfaculties or to adults with very limited normative competence, whether\ndue to congenital defects or social circumstance. Such restrictions on\nthe scope of Mill’s principles make little sense if basic liberties are\ndominant intrinsic goods, for then it should always be valuable to\naccord people liberties—a claim that Mill denies. Instead, Mill\nclaims that these liberties have value only when various necessary\nconditions for the exercise of deliberative capacities—in\nparticular, sufficient rational development or normative\ncompetence—are in place. \n\nWith a better understanding of the rationale and limits of Mill’s\nliberal principles, we can take a closer look at the details of his\ncategorical approach, including its centerpiece—the harm\nprinciple. \n\nFirst, recall that Mill distinguishes between harm and\nmere offense. Not every unwelcome consequence for others\ncounts as a harm. Offenses tend to be comparatively minor and\nephemeral. To constitute a harm, an action must be injurious or set\nback important interests of particular people, interests in which they\nhave rights (I 12; III 1; IV 3, 10, 12; V 5). Whereas Mill appears to\nreject the regulation of mere offense, the harm principle appears to be\nthe one justification he recognizes for restricting liberty. \n\nSecond, Mill envisions that the harm principle is something that we\ncan apply prospectively to prevent someone from acting in certain ways\nand causing harm. In many cases all we could reasonably know is that a\ngiven action risks harm. Fortunately, this seems to be all\nthat Mill requires (IV 10). There are interesting and important\nquestions about what threshold of risk must be met for purposes of the\nharm principle, which Mill does not address. Presumably, the threshold\nshould vary inversely with the magnitude of the harm risked, so that\nthe probability of harm required to justify regulation is lower the\ngreater the harm risked. \n\nThird, Mill wants the harm principle to have wide scope. He\ninsists that the harm principle regulates more than relations between\ngovernment and individuals. Its application should include the family,\nin particular, relationships between husbands and wives and parents and\nchildren (V 12). Here, he prefigures some claims he will develop in\nThe Subjection of Women (discussed below). \n\nFourth, though Mill often focuses simply on harm, it appears that\nhis real focus is on non-consensual harm (I 2; see Saunders 2016). He endorses\nthe maxim volenti non fit injuria, which he glosses in\nUtilitarianism as the doctrine that “that is not unjust\nwhich is done with the consent of the person who is supposed to be hurt\nby it” (U V 28). It is not that one cannot be hurt by\nsomething one has consented to or freely risked. Rather, when one has\nknowingly and willing risked something harmful, one cannot legitimately\ncomplain when that harm comes home to roost. Having my nose broken\nsurely counts as a harm, but if you broke my nose in a boxing match, I\ncannot fairly complain about the harm, because I consented to the\nrisk. \n\nDoes Mill really treat the harm principle as the sole legitimate\nbasis for restricting the liberties of individuals? As we have seen,\nMill cannot think that harm prevention is sufficient to justify\nrestricting liberty. \n\nAs soon as any part of a person’s conduct affects prejudicially the\ninterests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question\nwhether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering\nwith it, becomes open to discussion. (OL IV 3) \n\nLater, Mill makes clear that harm prevention is necessary but not\nsufficient to justify restrictions on liberty. \n\n[I]t must by no means be supposed, because damage, or probability of\ndamage, to the interests of others, can alone justify the interference\nof society, that therefore it always does justify such interference. (V\n3) \n\nThese claims demonstrate that Mill is not committed to a simple\nversion of the sufficiency of harm for restrictions on liberty.\nHowever, these claims are compatible with Mill endorsing a weaker\nversion of sufficiency. \n\nIf anyone does an act hurtful to others, there is a prima\nfacie case for punishing him by law or, where legal penalties are\nsafely applicable, by general disapprobation. (I 11) \n\nThis suggests that Mill’s position is that causing harm is always\npro tanto reason—a non-negligible reason—to\nregulate the action, but nonetheless a reason that might be outweighed\nby countervailing reasons not to regulate. If the regulation is more\nharmful than the behavior in question, it may be best not to regulate,\ndespite the pro tanto case for regulation. This suggests that\nwe should distinguish stronger and weaker versions of the idea that\nharm is sufficient to justify regulation. \n\nOnce we distinguish these options, there is a pretty compelling case\nfor thinking that Mill rejects strong sufficiency but embraces weak\nsufficiency. \n\nBut notice that if Mill rejects strong sufficiency then this\ncompromises his one very simple principle. For only strong sufficiency\nshows that the harm principle is a complete guide to the regulation of\nliberty, telling us both when regulation is impermissible and when it\nis required. Even weak sufficiency implies that the harm principle must\nbe supplemented with some other principle, such as the utilitarian\nprinciple, in order to determine if regulation is permissible, much\nless required. Mill’s doubts about strong sufficiency imply that his\nown conception of liberal rights requires more than the harm\nprinciple. \n\nIn rejecting strong sufficiency, Mill claims that actions that cause\nlosses in a fair competition should not be regulated (V 3–4).\nThis case would fall within his “free-trade” exception,\nwhich limits the scope of the liberty principle (V 4). Unfortunately,\nMill is not entirely clear about the basis for the free-trade\nexception. After all, losses, even in a fair competition, can be\nharmful. If I have a successful business selling widgets and then you\nmove into the area selling widgets at a big discount and drive me out\nof business, forcing me into bankruptcy, I suffer a significant loss,\nmaking me worse off than I would otherwise have been. \n\nIf Mill accepts weak, rather than strong, sufficiency, then he might\nclaim that though there is a reason to regulate harmful economic\ncompetition the costs of interfering with free markets are too great.\nHowever, this seems not be Mill’s preferred response. His official\nposition seems to be that the harm principle should not be applied to\nsuch economic harms (IV 4). It is hard to see why Mill embraces this\nsort of free-trade exception. A different and better reply would not\nsuspend the operation of the harm principle in such cases but rather\nclaim that such losses should not be understood as harms, in the\nrelevant sense. Mill might make either of two related arguments for not\ntreating such losses as harms. First, he might invoke the\nvolenti principle and insist that the harm principle targets\nonly non-consensual harms. He could then argue that in a market economy\nthat ensures fair terms of cooperation economic losses of the sort\ndescribed are freely risked and so consensual, in the relevant sense.\nSecond, Mill can and does claim that competitive losses are not harms,\nbecause they do not deprive economic actors of something to which they\nhave a right (OL V 3). Recall that Mill says that a harm\ninvolves damage to an interest to which a person has a right (I 12; III\n1; IV 3, 10, 12; V 5). You may beat me out in a fair competition for a\njob. But I don’t seem to have a right to the job. Instead, what I have\nis a right of fair opportunity to compete for the job. \n\nIs harm necessary to justify regulation? Though some of Mill’s\npronouncements suggest that causing harm is a necessary condition of\nrestricting liberty, closer inspection suggests that Mill countenances\nvarious restrictions on individual liberty that appear designed to\nbenefit others, rather than prevent harm. Let’s focus on two main kinds\nof apparent exceptions to the necessity thesis: (1) enforceable duties\nto others that benefit them, such as the duty to give evidence in court\nand Good Samaritan duties (I 11) and (2) enforceable duties to\ncontribute one’s fair share to the provision of various kinds of public\ngoods (IV 3), including the common defense (OL I 11;\nPPE V.viii.1), community infrastructure (PPE\nV.viii.1; CRG 538, 541), mandatory education (OL V\n12–14; PPE II.xiii.3, V.xi.8; CRG\n467–70), and state support for the arts (PPE V.xi.15).\nThese two sorts of exception present somewhat different issues. \n\nIn discussing enforceable duties to give evidence or Samaritan aid,\nMill claims that the failure to confer benefits constitutes harm. But\nit is not in general true that the failure to provide benefits always\ncounts as a harm. In many cases it seems not to. You would benefit me\nby transferring all your savings to my bank account (let us assume); it\ndoesn’t follow that your failure to do so harms me. Why not?\nPresumably, because we assess harms counterfactually: if x\nharms me, it makes me significantly worse off than I would have been\notherwise. This makes clear that harms are assessed relative to some\nbaseline. It is an interesting question how to set the baseline. But\nthe baseline cannot be set by the restriction on liberty itself; that\nwould convert all failures to benefit into harms. The baseline must\nhave some independent rationale. Consider Mill’s example of Good\nSamaritan laws. A classic example of the sort of Samaritan duty that\nMill favors would be the requirement to save a drowning child when I\ncould do so at little cost or risk to myself. It is not clear that my\nfailure to rescue harms the child. Have I made the child worse-off than\nhe would otherwise have been? Well, relative to what baseline? Of\ncourse, I have made him worse-off relative to the baseline situation in\nwhich Good Samaritanism is compulsory. But why select that baseline? I\nhaven’t made him worse-off relative to the situation he would have been\nin had I not been there. By hypothesis, he would have drowned in my\nabsence. If so, it is not clear that I harm the person whom I fail to\nrescue. This is not to deny that my failure to rescue is wrong and\nperhaps that the law ought to compel aid in such cases. But it does\nraise questions about whether we can justify Good Samaritan laws by\nappeal to the harm principle. \n\nNotice that even if my failure to rescue the child does not harm\nhim, he is nonetheless harmed by drowning. After all, he would have\nbeen better off had he not fallen into the pond and drowned. This\nsuggests a possible way for Mill to square Good Samaritan laws with the\nharm principle. Even if restrictions on A’s freedom, requiring\nhim to benefit B, cannot be justified on grounds of preventing\nA from harming B, they may nonetheless be justified\non the grounds of preventing harm to B. This draws our\nattention to a significant ambiguity in the harm principle (see Lyons\n1979). Mill talks both about preventing one from harming others and\nabout harm prevention. Indeed, his statement of the one very simple\nprinciple mentions both (OL I 9). But as the Samaritan example\nbrings out, these two claims are not equivalent. Every time I prevent\none person from harming another, I also engage in harm prevention. But\nsome cases of preventing harm may not be cases of preventing one person\nfrom harming another. So we really should distinguish two different\nversions of the harm principle. \n\nBecause every case of preventing one person from harming another is\na case of harm prevention, but not vice versa, HP1 is narrower than\nHP2. Indeed, HP1 is a proper part of HP2. Whereas HP1 justifies\nintervention only when the target herself would be the cause of harm to\nothers, HP2 would justify intervention to prevent harm to others,\nwhether that harm would be caused by the target or in some other way.\nClearly, HP2 will justify more intervention than HP1. As we have seen,\nit is hard to justify Good Samaritan laws if HP is the sole basis for\nrestricting liberty as long as we understand HP as HP1. The fact that\nMill thinks Samaritan laws can be squared with the harm principle (I\n11) is evidence that he understands the harm principle in terms of harm\nprevention. \n\nA different worry about the necessity of harm concerns those cases\ninvolving restrictions on liberty in the compulsory provision of public\ngoods. For it is part of the structure of public goods that the effect\nof individual contributions on provision of the public good is\nnegligible. The negative impact of an individual’s failure to\ncontribute is both small and is spread widely over the population. But\nthat means that even if failure to provide public goods would otherwise\ncount as a serious loss for all and a harm, the cost of individual\nfailures to provide for such goods does not seem to meet Mill’s\ncriteria for harmful conduct—the impact of individual failures to\ncontribute to public goods is too small and spread too widely to\nconstitute the breach of “a distinct and assignable obligation to\nany other person or persons” (IV 10). Insofar as this is a worry\nfor the harm principle, it seems to be equally a worry for HP1 and for\nHP2. \n\nOne Millian response is to deny that the harm principle is intended\nto serve as a necessary condition on any and all restrictions on\nliberty. As we saw, Mill is interested in defending\nfundamental or basic liberties, rather than liberty\nper se. In particular, he is interested in liberties of\nconscience and expressive liberties, liberties of tastes and pursuits,\nand liberties of association (I 12). He can defend these liberties as\nplaying a more central role in our practical deliberations and our\nformation and pursuit of personal ideals than other liberties. But then\nMill might try to justify the modest restrictions on liberty necessary\nto provide the benefits of significant public goods by claiming that,\neven if these restrictions on liberty don’t prevent harms, they do not\nrestrict fundamental liberties and they do help secure other goods,\nsuch as education, security, and sanitation, that serve as necessary\nconditions of our happiness. \n\nThis issue requires us to distinguish two more readings of the harm\nprinciple: one in terms of liberty per se and one in terms of\nbasic liberties. This distinction cuts across the distinction between\nanti-harming and harm prevention, giving us four possible\ninterpretations of the necessity claim. \n\nEarlier, we suggested that the harm principle would be more robust\nand better fit with Mill’s views about justified restrictions of\nliberty if we understood it is a harm prevention principle,\nessentially, as HP2A, rather than HP1A. Now we have seen how the harm\nprinciple would be more robust and better fit Mill’s views about\njustified restrictions of liberty if we understood it to regulate\nrestrictions on basic liberties, rather than liberty per se.\nThis requires us to interpret the harm principle as HP2B. We might call\nthis the basic liberties harm prevention principle. But if we\ninterpret the harm principle this way, then Mill is even further from a\nlibertarian view, at least if libertarianism is understood as the idea\nthat the only legitimate limit on individual liberty is to prevent that\nindividual from acting in ways that harm others. \n\nThe necessity claim that the harm principle makes is more robust if\nwe interpret it as the basic liberties harm prevention principle. But,\neven so interpreted, the necessity claim is still false. For all\nversions of the harm principle insist that paternalism is an\nimpermissible rationale for restriction. But Mill does not in fact\naccept a blanket prohibition on paternalism. He allows paternalistic\nrestrictions on selling oneself into slavery (V 11). In a moment, we\nwill discuss the justification and scope of this exception to the\nnormal prohibition on paternalism. But the exception itself shows that\nMill does not think that the only acceptable restrictions on liberty\nare those that prevent harm to others. For this is a case in which it\nis permissible to restrict liberty, not to prevent harm to others, but\nto prevent a special kind of harm to self. \n\nIf harm prevention is neither necessary nor sufficient for\njustifying restrictions on liberty, then Mill’s “one very simple\nprinciple” is over-simple. \n\nInsofar as Mill insists that preventing harm to others is the only\nlegitimate basis for restricting individual liberty, he is committed to\na blanket prohibition on paternalism. Why? Mill offers two explicit\nreasons. \n\nFirst, state power is liable to abuse. Politicians are\nself-interested and corruptible and will use a paternalistic license to\nlimit the freedom of citizens in ways that promote their own interests\nand not those of the citizens whose liberty they restrict (V\n20–3). \n\nSecond, even well intentioned rulers will misidentify the good of\ncitizens. Because an agent is a more reliable judge of his own good,\neven well intentioned rulers will promote the good of the citizens less\nwell than would the citizens themselves (IV 4, 12). \n\nThese are reasonably strong consequentialist arguments against\ngiving the state a broad discretionary power to engage in paternalistic\nlegislation whenever it sees fit. However, they do not support a\ncategorical ban on paternalism. In particular, these arguments provide\nno principled objection to paternalism—no objection to\nsuccessful paternalistic restrictions on B’s liberty\nthat do in fact benefit B. This weakness in Mill’s explicit\nargument against paternalism is like the weakness in his truth-tracking\ndefense of freedom of expression. Just as that argument provided no\nobjection to successful censorship (censorship of all and only false\nbelief), so too this argument provides no objection to successful\npaternalism (A’s restrictions on B’s liberty that do\nbenefit B). Perhaps some who object to paternalism are only\nconcerned with unsuccessful paternalism. But many would have doubts\nabout successful paternalism. For it is common to think that\nindividuals have a right to make choices in their own personal affairs\nand that this includes a right to make choices that are imprudent. \n\nHowever, Mill’s perfectionist conception of happiness provides a\nmore robust rationale against paternalism. For if a person’s happiness\ndepends on her exercise of the capacities that make her a responsible\nagent, then a principal ingredient of her own good must include\nopportunities for responsible choice and self-determination. But then\nit becomes clear how autonomy is an important part of a person’s good\nand how paternalism undercuts her good in important and predictable\nways. Mill may still not have an argument against successful\npaternalism, but his perfectionism gives him an argument that\nsuccessful paternalism is much harder to achieve than one might have\nthought, because it is very hard to benefit an autonomous agent in ways\nthat bypass her agency. \n\nDespite Mill’s blanket prohibitions on paternalism, he does not\n(consistently) reject paternalism per se. For instance, he is\nforced to qualify his blanket prohibition on paternalism in order to\nmaintain his claim that no one should be free to sell himself into\nslavery. \n\nThe ground for thus limiting his power of voluntarily disposing of\nhis own lot is apparent, and is very clearly seen in this extreme case.\n… [B]y selling himself for a slave, he abdicates his liberty; he\nforegoes any future use of it beyond that single act. He, therefore,\ndefeats in his own case, the very purpose which is the justification of\nallowing him to dispose of himself. (V 11) \n\nBecause it is the importance of exercising one’s deliberative\ncapacities that explains the importance of certain liberties, the usual\nreason for recognizing liberties provides an argument against extending\nliberties to do things that will permanently undermine one’s future\nexercise of those same capacities. In this case, an exception to the\nusual prohibition on paternalism is motivated by appeal to the very\nsame deliberative values that explain the usual prohibition. So this\nseems to be a principled exception to the usual prohibition on\npaternalism. We might call these autonomy-enhancing forms of\npaternalism. \n\nMill claims that the reasons for allowing paternalism in “this\nextreme case” are “evidently of far wider\napplication” (V 11). That raises the question of what other forms\nof paternalism might be justified as principled exceptions to the usual\nprohibition on paternalism. Unfortunately, Mill does not directly\naddress this question. However, in a nearby passage Mill does refer to\nthe “almost despotic power of husbands over wives” (V 12).\nWe might see Mill likening a wife’s consent to marriage, in which she\nmust surrender various rights of control over herself and her children,\nto someone contracting herself into slavery. This, of course, is a\ntheme that he develops in The Subjection of Women (discussed\nbelow). \n\nAs we have seen, Mill distinguishes between merely offensive and\ngenuinely harmful behavior. Whereas genuinely harmful behavior can be\nregulated, merely offensive behavior cannot (I 12; III 1; IV 3, 10, 12;\nV 5). However, in his discussion of drunkenness, Mill does at one point\nallow that offenses against others may be prohibited, at least when\nthey involve acts of public indecency. \n\nAgain, there are many acts which, being directly injurious only to\nthe agents themselves, ought not to be legally interdicted, but which,\nif done publicly, are a violation of good manners and, coming thus\nwithin the category of offenses against others, may be rightly\nprohibited. Of this kind are offenses against decency; on which it is\nunnecessary to dwell, the rather as they are only connected indirectly\nwith our subject, the objection to publicity being equally strong in\nthe case of many actions not in themselves condemnable, nor supposed to\nbe so. (V 7) \n\nThe immediate context is otherwise paternalistic restrictions with\ndrink. But when drinking that is otherwise purely self-regarding is\ndone in public, it becomes offensive and, Mill here claims, regulable.\nIt seems impossible to square this with Mill’s blanket prohibition on\noffense regulation. Why this exception for public\noffenses? Mill’s answer is that when done in public, the conduct comes\n“thus within the category of offense against others.” But\nif publicity is relevant because it makes the conduct offensive, then\nMill’s real appeal is to offense. But then this exception threatens to\nswallow the rule. \n\nMill may not have a consistent view about offense. It is instructive\nin this context to consider briefly the views of Joel Feinberg, who\nsees himself articulating a Millian position in his important\nfour-volume work Moral Limits of the Criminal Law\n(1984–88). Feinberg understands his own defense of Millian\nprinciples as involving a modified Millian categorical approach. His\nmain modification of Millian principles is to permit some forms of\noffense regulation. In Offense to Others (1985), Feinberg\nbegins by focusing on nuisance. Many offensive things are\nnuisances; they cause passing disagreeable mental states or sensations.\nBut even if many nuisances are just the price one has to pay to live in\na free society, it is common for the law to regulate nuisance. Feinberg\nthinks that some nuisances—especially public nuisances—can\njustify regulation. To determine when offense (nuisance) regulation is\npermissible and when it is not, Feinberg employs a balancing\ntest in which we must weigh the seriousness of the offense (e.g.,\nits magnitude and avoidability) against the importance of the agent’s\ninterests being regulated (e.g., their importance and the existence of\nalternative avenues of expression). \n\nThe details of Feinberg’s balancing test are complex and potentially\ncontroversial. But most liberal societies do in fact allow for some\nnuisance regulation. If one is going to consider modifying Mill’s\ncategorical approach so as to allow the prevention of profound\nnuisance, then one must employ some such balancing test and allow\nrestriction only when the offense is hard to avoid, the expressive\ninterests of the offenders are modest, and offenders have alternative\navenues of expression. Since Mill’s own position on offense regulation\nis not fully consistent, it is hard to say how big a modification this\nwould make in his liberal principles. \n\nMill, we saw, appears to reject legal moralism categorically (I 9).\nOther Millian liberals, such as Feinberg, treat the rejection of legal\nmoralism as a constitutive commitment of liberalism. Of course, a great\ndeal of morality is concerned with harm prevention, and central\nprovisions of the criminal law prohibiting killing, rape, assault, and\ntheft are clearly concerned to prevent especially serious moral wrongs\nthat harm others. This means that much of the criminal law both\nprevents harm and enforces morality. These are not simply coincidental\noutcomes, inasmuch as the immorality of much criminal conduct consists\nin its harmfulness. This could make us wonder if there are cases of\nlegal moralism that can’t be justified by appeal to the harm\nprinciple. \n\nEven if there is considerable overlap between harmful conduct and\nwrongdoing, the two are distinguishable. The traditional debate over\nlegal moralism between Devlin (1965) and Hart (1963) concerned the\nlegislative enforcement of sexual morality, in particular, the\nregulation of homosexuality, prostitution, and pornography. For the\nmost part, both sides conceded that these activities were immoral but\nharmless and debated whether it could be permissible to regulate them\nas a matter of enforcing sexual morality. But we might reject Devlin’s\nmoralistic proposals, not because we reject legal moralism per\nse, but rather because we do not regard homosexuality,\nprostitution, or pornography as per se immoral. If these were\nthe only candidates for harmless wrongdoing, we might wonder if there\nwas such a thing. For this reason, we might consider a less\ncontroversial case of harmless immorality, say, a case of\npromise-breaking or deception that actually fails to result in harm.\nSuppose Junior takes his parents’ car out without their permission but\nnothing untoward happens. Here is a case of harmless wrongdoing.\nConsider this argument for moral legislation. \n\nPresumably, liberals would reject (3), claiming that this is a case\nin which the law should not intervene. Here, it might seem that we need\nto reject the moralistic premise in (1) in order to avoid the illiberal\nconclusion in (3). Indeed, many people tend to think that to avoid\nilliberal conclusions about moral legislation one must reject legal\nmoralism as such. \n\nBut the argument is not valid, from which it follows that we cannot\nappeal to the falsity of the illiberal conclusion to reject the\nmoralistic premise. The legal moralist principle (1) asserts only a\npro tanto or prima facie reason to regulate. But a\npro tanto reason to regulate does not entail an\nall-thing-considered reason to regulate. In particular, even if there\nis some reason to regulate conduct, there may be countervailing reasons\nnot to regulate it. Perhaps the costs of\nregulation—administrative and otherwise—exceed the benefit\nof regulation. But this shows that the legal moralist need not regulate\nall harmless wrongdoing, and this shows that it is not necessary to\nreject legal moralism as such in order to defend some liberal\nconclusions. This does not entail that Mill’s rejection of legal\nmoralism is wrong, only that it is not necessary to deliver most of his\nliberal conclusions. \n\nThis shows us that we should distinguish stronger and weaker legal\nmoralist claims. \n\nAs we’ve just seen, liberal claims that harmless immorality should\nnot be regulated are inconsistent with strong moralism, but not with\nweak moralism. It’s clear that Mill rejects strong moralism. What is\nless clear is whether he also rejects weak moralism. We must endorse\nweak moralism if we think that there are cases of harmless wrongdoing\nwhere legal regulation is not only pro tanto justified but\nalso on-balance justified. Any list is potentially controversial, but\nmany people would think that it is not only permissible but also\ndesirable to regulate unsuccessful criminal attempts, fraud and\nblackmail that do not harm, desecration of the dead, and bestiality. If\nany of these should be regulated, that may require weak legal\nmoralism. \n\nMill’s “one very simple principle”—that liberty\nmay be restricted always and only to prevent harm to another—is\nover-simple. So too is the related categorical approach to liberty that\napproves all applications of the harm principle and rejects all cases\nof paternalism, censorship, offense regulation, and legal moralism. \n\nThe harm principle itself is complex in several ways. Harm to others\nis not a sufficient ground for restricting liberty. Rather, it creates\na pro tanto reason for restricting liberty. Determination of\nwhether restrictions on harmful conduct are fully justified depends on\nbalancing the evils of regulation against the harm to be prevented.\nMoreover, it is not clear if the harm principle justifies restricting\nliberty to prevent others from being harmed or only justifies\nrestricting liberty to prevent those whose liberty is being restricted\nfrom causing harm to another. The anti-harming rationale for\nrestricting liberty is narrower than the harm-prevention rationale.\nOnly the broader harm-prevention rationale would explain how Mill could\nhope to square Good Samaritan laws and laws compelling testimony in\ncourt with the harm principle. Because the harm-prevention principle is\nbroader, it will justify greater restrictions on liberty than the\nanti-harming principle. It is also unclear whether the harm principle\nprotects all liberty or just basic liberties. The harm principle is\nmore robust if it targets restrictions on basic liberties, rather than\nliberty per se. But if we qualify the harm principle in these\nways, we are very far from the common libertarian reading of the harm\nprinciple as limiting any and all liberty only to prevent force or\nfraud. \n\nHowever these questions are resolved, it is doubtful that the harm\nprinciple is necessary to justify restrictions on liberty. Mill makes\nprincipled exceptions to his general anti-paternalism to defend the\npermissibility of restrictions on selling oneself into slavery and\nother autonomy-enhancing forms of paternalism. Mill does allow some\nforms of offense regulation designed to prevent public indecency.\nMoreover, though Mill does seem more consistent in his opposition to\nlegal moralism, it is not necessary to reject legal moralism as such in\norder to recognize the liberal conclusion that many forms of legal\nmoralism do not do enough good in order to justify the harms they\ncause. \n\nHarm prevention is neither necessary nor sufficient to restrict\nindividual liberties. Nonetheless, one might argue that Mill recognizes\nbasic liberties as especially important interests that can only be\ninterfered with to prevent harm to others and or to prevent significant\nharm to the individual’s own agency. \n\nHaving examined Mill’s liberalism we can return to the apparent\ntension between liberal rights and utilitarianism. For even if Mill\nemploys complex, rather than simple, categories, there appears to be a\ntension between categorical protections of basic liberties and the sort\nof case-by-case consequentialist analysis that utilitarianism would\nseem to require. We might consider three different reconciliation\nstrategies. \n\nMill’s explicit theory of rights is introduced in Chapter V of\nUtilitarianism in the context of his sanction theory of duty,\nwhich is an indirect form of utilitarianism that identifies wrong\nactions as actions that it is useful to sanction (U V 14).\nMill then introduces justice as a proper part of duty. Justice involves\nduties that are perfect duties—that is, duties that are\ncorrelated with rights (V 15). \n\nJustice implies something which it is not only right to do, and\nwrong not to do, but which some individual person can claim from us as\na matter of right. (V 15) \n\nMill explains his theory of rights in terms of the two elements in a\nrights violation—an injury to the right holder and warranted\npunishment. \n\nThese [two] elements are, a hurt to some assignable person or\npersons on the one hand, and a demand for punishment on the other.\n… [T]hese two things include all that we mean when we speak of\nviolation of a right. When we call anything a person’s right, we mean\nthat he has a valid claim on society to protect him in the possession\nof it, either by the force of law, or by that of education and opinion.\nIf he has what we consider a sufficient claim, on whatever account, to\nhave something guaranteed to him by society, we say that he has a right\nto it. If we desire to prove that anything does not belong to him by\nright, we think this is done as soon as it is admitted that society\nought not to take measures for securing it to him, but should leave it\nto chance, or to his own exertions. (V 24) \n\nThis is a sanction theory of rights, akin to Mill’s sanction theory\nof duty. It says that one has a right to some interest or liberty\ninsofar as society ought to protect that interest or liberty. \n\nSo far, this conception of a right does not yet introduce any\nutilitarian considerations. Mill adds utilitarianism to the mix in his\naccount of the conditions under which society ought to enforce an\nindividual’s claim. \n\nTo have a right, then, is, I conceive, to have something which\nsociety ought to defend me in the possession of. If the objector goes\non to ask why it ought, I can give him no other reason than general\nutility. (V 25) \n\nThis sanction theory of rights is an indirect utilitarian one\ninsofar as it implies that whether someone has a right to something\ndepends not on the utility of that claim but on the utility of our\nresponses to violations of that claim. \n\nDoes the sanction theory of rights provide a good reconciliation of\nrights and utility? Not surprisingly, the sanction theory of rights\ninherits the problems of the sanction theory of duty. Recall that we\nfound sanction utilitarianism to be internally inconsistent insofar as\nit combines indirect and direct utilitarian claims\n (§2.10).\n Because the sanction theory of rights\nis committed to sanction utilitarianism, it inherits this\ninconsistency. \n\n(2) and (3) are inconsistent. One could respond by decoupling the\nsanction theory of rights from the sanction theory of duty. But if we\nreject the sanction theory of duty, why accept a sanction theory of\nrights? \n\nMoreover, the sanction theory of rights has problems of its own. The\nsanction theory of rights treats the desirability of social enforcement\nas constitutive of the idea of a right. But this seems to get things\nbackward. It is because we have rights that society ought to enforce\nthem; it is not that we have rights to whatever society ought to\nenforce. The desirability of social enforcement seems\nconsequential on the existence of the right. This is even\nclearer, because there are some claims that society ought to enforce\nthat are not rights. Among the things that society ought to recognize\nand protect are both rights and privileges. The exact line\nbetween rights and privileges is not always clear. But we recognize the\ndistinction in claiming that some interests and opportunities that the\nstate ought to protect are not ones that can be claimed as a matter of\nright. This shows that the usefulness of social enforcement cannot be\nconstitutive of a right, because otherwise privileges would be\nrights. \n\nThough the sanction theory is Mill’s explicit conception of rights,\nhe has the resources for two other conceptions. \n\nWe saw that Mill recognizes the need for various secondary\nprinciples in moral reasoning\n (§2.9).\n These\nare principles that do not themselves refer to utility but whose\nadoption and general deployment are justified on utilitarian grounds.\nSo one way for Mill to reconcile rights and utility is for him to treat\nrights as secondary principles, perhaps especially important ones,\nwhose observance is justified on utilitarian grounds (also see Berger\n1984: chs. 3–4). On this interpretation, rights are protected by\nrules that insulate an individual’s interest or liberty from certain\nkinds of interference and that make no direct reference to the good\nconsequences of insulation. We should observe such rules more or less\nuncritically, and set them aside only when adherence to them is clearly\nsuboptimal or in cases of conflicts among such rules (rights). In such\nexceptional cases, we should make direct appeal to the principle of\nutility. But, otherwise, not. \n\nWhy should we regulate our conduct by such rules? Because doing so\nis generally but imperfectly optimal, and we are unable to discriminate\nfor cases in which deviation form the rules is suboptimal without\ndeviating from them in other cases in which it is not. \n\nWhy should we believe that there are interests or liberties that it\nis generally but imperfectly optimal to protect? Mill’s answer is that\nsome interests and liberties play a more fundamental role in human\nhappiness than others. On this reading, rights protect pre-eminent\nor especially important goods. \n\nWhile I dispute the pretensions of any theory which sets up an\nimaginary standard of justice not grounded on utility, I account the\njustice which is grounded on utility to be the chief part, and\nincomparably the most sacred and binding part, of all morality. Justice\nis a name for certain classes of moral rules which concern the\nessentials of human well-being more nearly, and are therefore of more\nabsolute obligation, than any other rules for the guidance of life; and\nthe notion which we have found to be of the essence of the idea of\njustice—that of a right residing in an individual—implies\nand testifies to this more binding obligation. (U V 32; also\nsee V 33, 37–38) \n\nIndeed, if the goods protected by rights are so important, we can\nunderstand why Mill might think that society ought to enforce them by\nlaw or opinion (V 24). But notice that here enforceability is a\nconsequence of the importance of rights, rather than the defining\nfeature of rights. \n\nThis conception of rights presupposes a hierarchy of values\nin which some kinds of goods are superior to others. We know that Mill\naccepts a hierarchy of values from his doctrine of higher pleasures.\nThat doctrine treats the possession and use of\ncapacities for practical deliberation as higher-order goods. Various\nliberties of thought and action are important as necessary conditions\nfor realizing these higher-order goods. \n\nBut if the rights we have are to especially important goods, then we\ncan see how honoring rights promotes the good. By hypothesis, it will\nbe best to honor rights when this conflicts with the promotion of\nlesser goods. We might say that rights “trump” these lesser\ngoods. Rights don’t trump the pursuit of other comparably important\ngoods. These should be treated as conflicts of rights, and the\nutilitarian should resolve such conflicts by recourse to the\nutilitarian first principle and a determination of which right, in the\ncontext, is most important. \n\nThese three conceptions of rights offer somewhat different ways of\nreconciling utility and rights. The biggest difference is between the\nsanction theory, on the one hand, and the secondary principle and\npre-eminent goods conceptions, on the other hand, because the first is\nan indirect utilitarian conception of rights, whereas the second two\nare compatible with direct utilitarianism. Whereas the sanction theory\nof rights appears problematic, the secondary principles and pre-eminent\ngoods conceptions appear more plausible. It would be premature to say\nthat they are fully adequate conceptions of rights, but they do offer\nsome promise of reconciling utility and rights. \n\nWe get a somewhat different perspective on Mill’s utilitarian and\nliberal principles by seeing how he applies them to social and\npolitical issues. We might begin by focusing on Mill’s defense of a\ndemocratic form of liberalism in Considerations on Representative\nGovernment and Principles of Political Economy. \n\nIn Considerations on Representative Government Mill argues\nthat a form of representative democracy is the best ideal form of\ngovernment. It is not an invariant ideal that holds regardless of\nhistorical or social circumstances. But he does think that it is the\nbest form of government for societies with sufficient resources,\nsecurity, and culture of self-reliance. In particular, Mill thinks that\nrepresentative democracy is best, when it is best, because it best\nsatisfies two criteria of all good government: (1) that government is\ngood insofar as it promotes the common good, where this is conceived of\nas promoting the moral, intellectual, and active traits of its\ncitizens, and (2) that government is good insofar as it makes effective\nuse of institutions and the resources of its citizens to promote the\ncommon good (CRG 390, 392). Insofar as (2) is really a\ncomponent of (1), Mill’s ultimate criterion is that good government\nshould promote the common good of its citizens. Mill does not\nexplicitly invoke his version of utilitarianism. Perhaps he wants his\ndefense of representative democracy to rest on more ecumenical\npremises. But he clearly understands this political criterion of the\ncommon good in broadly consequentialist or result-oriented terms.\nMoreover, though he may not mention the higher pleasures doctrine\nexplicitly, it is also clear that Mill understands the good of each in\nbroadly perfectionist terms that emphasize the importance of an active\nand autonomous form of life that exercises intellectual, deliberative,\nand creative capacities. \n\nMill thinks that there are two ways in which democracy is, under the\nright circumstances, best suited to promote the common good. \n\nFirst, he thinks that democracy plays an important\nepistemic role in identifying the common good. Proper\ndeliberation about issues affecting the common good requires\nidentifying how different policies would bear on the interests of\naffected parties and so requires the proper representation and\narticulation of the interests of citizens. But failure of imagination\nand the operation of personal bias present obstacles to the effective\nrepresentation of the interests of others. Universal suffrage and\npolitical participation provide the best assurance that the interests\nof the governed will be properly appreciated by political\ndecision-makers (404). \n\nSecond, Mill thinks that democracy is also the best form of\ngovernment because of the constitutive effects of political\nparticipation on the improvement of the moral capacities of citizens\n(404). To the extent that the governed can and do participate in public\ndebate and elections they exercise those very deliberative capacities\nthat it is the aim of government to develop. They learn to gather\ninformation about their options, deliberate about their merits, and\nchoose a representative that will give expression to their ideals and\npreferences. But they deliberate and choose with others about a public\nagenda, and in so doing they cultivate abilities to form a conception\nof a common good, to take principled stands, to exchange reasons with\nothers, and to learn from others. \n\nSo far, these would seem to be arguments for\nwidespread—indeed, universal—direct democracy. In fact,\nunlike many of his contemporaries interested in expanding the\nfranchise, Mill defends the extension of the franchise to women too,\nrejecting any restriction on their franchise as baseless (479). But\nMill qualifies this defense of direct democracy in various significant\nways. \n\nDemocracy presumably involves rule by the will of the people. We\nmight say that a political system is democratic insofar as the content\nof its political decisions reflect the will of the people. A direct\ndemocracy, in which every citizen votes on legislation, is one way for\npolitical decisions to reflect the will of the people. But direct\ndemocracy is impractical in anything but a small community (412). Mill\ndefends representative, rather than direct, democracy. \n\nMill believes that representatives are charged with the task of\nvoting, after free and open discussion, their own considered views\nabout what would promote the common good (490). Here Mill expresses\ndoubts about an interest group model of democracy, according to which\nrepresentatives are advocates of the sectarian interests of their\nconstituents and democracy is seen as an impartial aggregation and set\nof compromises among sectarian interests. Instead, Mill regards\nrepresentatives as fiduciaries in a public trust, in which each\nrepresentative aims at a genuinely common good, and in which individual\nand collective deliberations are shaped by a diversity of experiences\nand perspectives. \n\nMany needs are local in nature, and, even when the needs are\ngeneral, their satisfaction may depend heavily on local conditions. For\nthis reason, Mill advocates a federal system in which a central\nrepresentative body has more limited functions and local or municipal\nrepresentative bodies govern in matters involving local affairs or\nlocal detail, such as the creation and maintenance of local\ninfrastructure, including roads, courts, jails, and schools\n(422–34). \n\nHowever, one important function of a central government, Mill\nbelieves, is the need to protect local political minorities from being\nsystematically disadvantaged by local political majorities (544). Here\nhe shows his concern with individual rights against the tyranny of the\nmajority, which was a focus of On Liberty, and suggests that\nconstitutional guarantees may be better preserved by central, rather\nthan local, authorities. Unfortunately, he does not devote much\nattention to exactly which individual rights should be recognized\nconstitutionally. \n\nMill also insists that a representative democracy, either local or\nfederal, should employ proportional, rather than\nwinner-take-all, representation (CRG 449–62;\n“Thoughts on Parliamentary Reform” 328–29). We can\nsee how proportional representation fits with the epistemic argument\nfor democracy. Winner-take-all representation may eliminate or reduce\neffective expression of minority points of view so essential for free\nand informed inquiry about the common good and respecting the interests\nof political minorities (CRG 458). \n\nIn his philosophical writings and in his service as a Liberal member\nof Parliament for Westminster from 1865 to 1868, Mill was a vigorous\nadvocate for extending the franchise. Though he recognized some limits\nin the scope of the franchise, he was a consistent, though not always\nsuccessful, advocate for its extension beyond its then current\nscope. He supported extending the franchise to previously\ndisenfranchised members of the working class, and he was a staunch\nadvocate for female suffrage (479–81). To many, such views about\nthe appropriate scope of the franchise seemed quite radical. Though\nMill did support weighted voting, he may have seen this, at least in\npart, as a necessary concession to succeed in securing his primary\nobjective of (near) universal suffrage (476). It is worth bearing this\ncontext in mind when evaluating Mill’s proposals for the scope and\nweight of the franchise. \n\nAs we noted earlier, Mill does not defend representative democracy\nas ideal under all historical and social circumstances. There are some\nsocial circumstances, he thinks, in which democracy will not promote\nthe common good. These are backward states of society in which most\ncitizens are unfit to rule, because they lack necessary ingredients of\nthe culture of autonomy to exercise decision-making authority\nresponsibly. They lack discipline, or education, or an active and\nindependent character. Different forms of government are appropriate\nfor such backward states of advancement. In particular, Mill thinks\nthat benevolent rule by an enlightened one or few, which aimed at the\ncommon good, would be better suited for such societies (415–18).\nHere, Mill is introducing a scope limitation on the defense of\npolitical rights that he recognized explicitly in his defense of basic\nliberties in On Liberty (I 10). There are important practical\nquestions, which Mill does not address very clearly, about which\nsocieties cross this threshold of capacity for improvement by free\ninquiry and political rights. But he does make clear that political\nparticipation, like free inquiry, is important as a necessary condition\nfor the exercise of our higher capacities and has value only when a\nthreshold level of normative competence is met. \n\nWhat is true of some societies in relation to others is also true of\nsome individuals in relation to others within societies that cross this\nthreshold of normative competence. This explains limitations on the\nscope of the franchise that Mill recognizes within such advanced\ncivilizations. He confines the scope of the franchise to mature adults,\nexcluding minors who would not have crossed the threshold of normative\ncompetence. He is also prepared to exclude those adults who are not\nliterate (CRG 470–71). This is a failure of normative\ncompetence for which society is to blame and which it is society’s duty\nto correct (470). Mill also excludes from the franchise those adults\nwho do not pay taxes and are on public assistance (472). Here he\nexpresses the concern that voting gives one a say not only over one’s\nown life but also over the lives of others and that without\ncontributing to the production of an economic surplus one has no right\nto help determine how this surplus is distributed. Mill is also\ncommitted to doubts about the normative competence of those on public\nassistance. Elsewhere, Mill insists that charities make beneficiaries\ndependent on benefactors in ways that compromise their autonomy and\nindependence (PPE V.xi.13; SW 330). Insofar as this\nis true, it provides an additional rationale for excluding dependents\nfrom the franchise. \n\nThe main limitations on the scope of the franchise that Mill\nrecognizes track this threshold of normative competence. Mill thinks\nthat the reasons for favoring democracy apply to all those above this\nnormative threshold. Literate manual laborers have the same claim to\nthe franchise, Mill thinks, as anyone else. They need to stand up for\ntheir own interests and make sure they are properly reckoned in\npolitical decision-making. Moreover, they stand to benefit from\npolitical participation, because of the way it develops their\ndeliberative capacities. \n\nOf course, there are differences in normative competence among those\nabove this threshold. But Mill’s account of representative democracy\ntracks these further differences in terms of the weight,\nrather than the scope, of the franchise (CRG 473).\nDifferences in normative competence above this threshold should affect\nthe comparative weight of one’s vote. This scheme of weighted voting\ntakes the form of a system of plural votes (CRG 467–81; also\nsee “Parliamentary Reform” 322–28). Mill emphatically\nrejects property qualifications as suitable proxies for normative\ncompetence (CRG 474; “Parliamentary Reform” 325)\nand insists on educational qualifications. \n\nThe most direct mode of effecting this, would be to establish the\nplurality of votes, in favour of those who could afford a reasonable\npresumption of superior knowledge and cultivation. … The\nperfection, then, of an electoral system would be, that every person\nshould have one vote, but that every well-educated person in the\ncommunity should have more than one, on a scale corresponding as far as\npracticable to their amount of education. (“Parliamentary\nReform” 324–25) \n\nThere is an upper limit on the system of plural votes such that the\nweighted votes of the educational elite will not give them a majority\ncoalition that could advance its class interests at the expense of the\nuneducated (CRG 476). \n\nMill’s commitment to weighted voting reflects his views about the\nbackward state of the working classes. \n\nThe opinions and wishes of the poorest and rudest class of labourers\nmay be very useful as one influence among others on the minds of the\nvoters, as well as on those of the Legislature; and yet it may be\nhighly mischievous to give them the preponderant influence, but\nadmitting them, in their present state of morals and intelligence, to\nthe full exercise of the suffrage. (“Parliamentary Reform”\n334) \n\nDespite these doubts about the working classes, Mill regarded\nhimself as their friend (Autobiography 274; see Ten 1998).\nMill did not blame the working classes for their comparative\ninferiority, and he did not regard their inferiority as a natural or\npermanent condition. He thought that improved access to quality primary\nand secondary education and greater scope for civic participation would\ngradually improve normative competence in the working classes\n(PPE IV.vii.2). Insofar as this is true, the qualification to\nMill’s commitment to political equality, represented by his scheme of\nweighted voting, is temporary and transitional. In this sense, weighted\nvoting is not part of ideal political theory in the way that (near)\nuniversal suffrage and proportional representation are. \n\nEven if weighted voting tracks the epistemic reasons for democracy\nand differences in underlying normative competence, it violates norms\nof political equality. Mill seems not to recognize the potentially\ncorrosive effects of weighted voting in terms of the message it sends\nof second-class citizenship to the working classes. He thinks that\nself-respect requires only that one have the vote, not that one have an\nequal vote, regardless of normative competence. \n\nThere is not, in this arrangement [weighted voting], anything\nnecessarily invidious to those to whom it assigns the lower degrees of\ninfluence. Entire exclusion from a voice in the common concerns is one\nthing; the concession to others of a more potential voice, on the\nground of greater capacity for the management of the joint interests,\nis another. The two things are not merely different, they are\nincommensurable. Everyone has a right to feel insulted by being made a\nnobody, and stamped as of no account at all. No one but a fool …\nfeels offended by the acknowledgment that there are others whose\nopinion … is entitled to a greater amount of consideration than\nhis. (CRG 474) \n\nBut why should I care so much about being branded a nobody and not\nat all about being branded a lesser somebody? One might well want to\nharness the resources and expertise of an educated elite, perhaps, as\nMill already imagines, by giving them special roles in the drafting of\nlegislation or in setting the agenda for public deliberations. But this\ndoes not require giving the educated elite plural votes. Doing that\nseems to have significant symbolic value, saying that working classes\nshould have less political standing and say. From this perspective,\nMill displays something of a tin ear for such concerns about weighted\nvoting. Interestingly, while he does not seem especially sensitive to\nconcerns about the bad effects of second-class citizenship in\nConsiderations on Representative Government, he seems much\nmore sensitive to such concerns in The Subjection of Women. As\nwe will see, Mill is acutely aware of the variety of ways in which\nwomen’s contributions can be discouraged and undervalued and of the\nindividual and social costs of women’s second-class status. Had Mill\nbeen as mindful of the costs of according workers second-class\ncitizenship as he would later be of the costs of according women\nsecond-class status, he might have been more skeptical of weighted\nvoting than he in fact was. \n\nWhat of the substance of democratic government? Though Mill is an\nadvocate of limited government in ways that one might expect given his\ndefense of basic liberties in On Liberty, he is no\nlibertarian. He emphatically rejects the idea that legitimate\ngovernment is limited to the functions of affording protection against\nforce and fraud (PPE V.i.2). Instead, he thinks that there are\na variety of ways in which government can and should intervene in the\nlives of citizens—sometimes as coercer and other times as enabler\nor facilitator—in order to promote the common good. Mill’s claims\nabout happiness imply that the good of each consists in the exercise of\nher higher capacities. This requires an active life in which one’s\nactivities are regulated by one’s deliberations and choices. As we have\nseen in Mill’s critical discussions of paternalism, this places limits\non how others can promote one’s own good. I can’t promote your good,\nunderstood in this way, in ways that bypass your agency anymore than I\ncan win a race for you. But just as I can do things to help you win the\nrace yourself (training with you, sharing nutritional tips, and helping\nyou plan strategy), so too I can do things that help you lead an\nautonomous life. I can provide various sorts of necessary conditions\nfor your leading such a life. If an individual’s good consists in this\nsort of self-realization, then a government which aims at the\ncommon good should concern itself in significant part with the fair\nprovision of opportunities for welfare. \n\nEarly in The Subjection of Women Mill contrasts systems of\nhereditary caste, such as feudalism and social systems based on\nslavery, with the distinctively modern and progressive commitment to\nequal opportunity for welfare. \n\nFor, what is the peculiar character of the modern world—the\ndifference which chiefly distinguishes modern institutions, modern\nsocial ideas, modern life itself, from those of times long past? It is\nthat human beings are no longer born into their place in life, and\nchained down by an inexorable bond to the place they are born to, but\nare free to employ their faculties, and such favorable chances as\noffer, to achieve the lot which may appear to them most desirable.\n(SW 272–73) \n\nAs with basic liberties, opportunities for welfare have value, not\nin themselves, but as necessary conditions for the sort of\nself-realization to which Mill assigns pre-eminent intrinsic value. But\nthey are no less important for that reason. Indeed, many of the\nfunctions of government that he recognizes can be traced to providing\nopportunities for self-realization. \n\nThough Mill generally opposes paternalism, censorship, offense\nregulation, and moralism, he does recognize various functions that\ngovernment should perform in pursuing the common good. In part because\nthe opportunities for each depend in part upon the position and\nresources of others, Mill thinks that provision of fair equality of\nopportunity constrains permissible socio-economic inequalities\n(PPE II.ii.1). \n\nA just and wise legislation would abstain from holding out motives\nfor dissipating rather than saving the earnings of honest exertion. Its\nimpartiality between competitors would consist in endeavoring that they\nshould all start fair …. Many, indeed, fail with greater efforts\nthan those with which others succeed, not from difference of merits,\nbut difference of opportunities; but if all were done which it would be\nin the power of a good government to do, by instruction and by\nlegislation, to diminish this inequality of opportunities, the\ndifferences of fortune arising from people’s own earnings could not\njustly give umbrage. (PPE V.ii.3) \n\nAs Mill makes clear in this passage, his concern is not with\ninequality as such. Though he envisions a society in which inequalities\nare reduced and in which a decent minimum standard of living is\navailable to all (PPE IV.vi.2), he does defend the profits of\ncapitalists as a just recompense for their savings, risk, and economic\nsupervision (PPE II.xv.1; “Chapters on Socialism”\n734–35). Rather, Mill’s concern in this passage is with\ninequalities derived from inequality of opportunity and those\ninequalities that perpetuate inequality of opportunity. To achieve\nequality of opportunity, Mill endorses various redistributive tax\nmeasures (also see Berger 1984: 159–86). He defends a flat tax\nrate on earned income above a threshold necessary to secure a decent\nminimum standard of living, leaving earned income below this threshold\nuntaxed (PPE II.i.3, II.xii.2, II.xii.3, V.ii.1–3,\nV.iii.3–5). In addition, he endorses the use of higher tax rates\non unearned income and on inheritance (PPE II.ii.1,\nII.ii.3–4, II.xii.3, V.ii.3, V.ii.5, V.vi.2, V.ix.1). Such taxes\nlimit intergenerational inequalities that would otherwise constrain\nequality of opportunity. \n\nWithin this framework established for equal opportunity, Mill\ndefends additional governmental functions designed to promote the\ncommon good. A prime condition of normative competence is a decent\neducation, and Mill thinks that it is one of the central roles of the\nstate to require and, if necessary, provide a quality education\n(OL V 12–13; PPE V.xi.8). Mill thinks that the\nstate can and should require parents to provide schooling for their\nchildren, ensuring that this kind of education is available to all,\nregardless of financial circumstances, by subsidizing the costs of\neducation for the poor so that it is available free or at a nominal\ncost. \n\nWe have also seen that Mill thinks that charity breeds dependence,\nrather than autonomy. This is one reason that he defends the adoption\nof Poor Laws that provide, among other things, work for the able-bodied\nindigent (PPE II.xii.2). Mill also thinks that government\nshould step in where market forces are unlikely to provide what people\nneed or want (PPE V.xi.8). In this way, he thinks that it is\nan important function for the state, whether central or local, to\ncreate and maintain various aspects of community infrastructure,\nincluding such things as a common defense, roads, sanitation, police,\nand correctional facilities (PPE V.vii.1; CRG 541).\nHe also thinks regulation of working conditions (hours, wages, and\nbenefits) is permissible, because the provision of improved working\nconditions typically has the structure of a public or collective good\nfor workers, each of whom stands to gain a competitive advantage by\nconceding a little more to capital than his peers (PPE\nV.xi.12). If left unregulated, each has incentive to concede more to\ncapital than his rivals, with the result that all workers are made\nworse-off. State intervention and regulation, Mill thinks, is the best\nsolution to this collective action problem. He also thinks that there\nare other goods for which market provision will lead to\nunderproduction, presumably because of positive externalities, which is\nwhy he thinks that the state should subsidize scientific research and\nthe arts (PPE V.xi.15). \n\nMill’s liberalism is committed to democratic political institutions\nin which the franchise is widespread, private property rights, market\neconomies, equal social and economic opportunity, and a variety of\npersonal and civic liberties. To appreciate the significance of his\nbrand of liberalism, it is helpful to focus on the substance of his\nconception of liberal essentials—the package of individual\nliberties and state responsibilities that he endorses—and the way\nhe justifies his conception of liberal essentials. Millian liberalism\nis not laissez-faire liberalism, and it justifies liberal essentials as\na way of promoting the common good. The distinctiveness of this brand\nof liberalism is perhaps best seen in contrast with two other\nconceptions of liberalism—a more libertarian conception of\nliberal essentials and their justification that dominated the British\nLiberal Party at mid-century and the sort of contemporary political\nliberalism that justifies liberal essentials as required if the state\nis to be neutral among rival conceptions of the good life that its\ncitizens might hold. \n\nA good part of the agenda of the Liberal Party during much of the\nnineteenth century consisted in reforms that sought to undo limitations\nthat the state placed on the liberties and opportunities of citizens,\nespecially when these forms of state intervention tended to reinforce\nclass privileges. This political culture was exemplified in the repeal\nof the Corn Laws, opposition to religious persecution, and several\nelectoral reforms. But in the later part of the nineteenth century\nthere emerged a new view about the role of such reforms within the\nLiberal agenda. Earlier Liberals, such as Herbert Spencer, thought that\nreform should be limited to the removal of state interference with\nindividual liberty. By contrast, the New Liberals thought that these\nreforms that extended economic, social, and political liberties had to\nbe supplemented by social and economic reforms in areas of labor,\neducation, and health designed to redress the effects of inequality.\nThese new reforms gave the state positive, and not just negative,\nresponsibilities that sometimes required interference with individual\nliberties. Because Mill thinks that the state has an important role to\nplay in securing equal opportunity, ensuring a good education that will\nnurture normative competence, and redressing various market failures\nand providing various public goods, it makes sense to view Mill as\nlaying much of the intellectual groundwork for the New\nLiberalism—both in its conception of liberal essentials and in\nits conception of the proper justification of liberal essentials by\nappeal to a broadly consequentialist interest in promoting\nself-realization. \n\nMill’s perfectionist justification of liberal essentials also\nprovides a contrast with an influential strand in recent\nAnglo-American philosophical defenses of liberalism that insist\non neutrality among rival conceptions of the good life (see\nTurner 2017). According to many contemporary liberals, neutrality\nabout the good is a constitutive commitment of liberalism, and liberal\nneutrality places limits on the justification of state action. Liberal\ngovernments, on this view, can and must enforce individual rights and\nany further demands of social justice, including those necessary to\nmaintain peace and order. But they are not to undertake any action as\na way of promoting a particular conception of the good life or a\ncomprehensive philosophical doctrine. On matters of the good, a\nliberal state must be strictly neutral. It can promote the good of its\ncitizenry only in ways that are consistent with every reasonable\nconception of the good (see Rawls 1993 and Kymlicka 1989). \n\nBy contrast, Mill is a perfectionist liberal who eschews neutrality\nabout the good. According to Millian perfectionism, the good life is\nnot defined in sectarian terms as consisting in a particular set of\nactivities. Rather, the good life is understood in terms of the\nexercise of capacities for practical deliberation that can be realized\nin very diverse, though limited, ways. Basic liberties are important\nbecause they are necessary conditions for this sort of reflective\nself-direction and self-realization. On this version of liberalism, the\nstate recognizes various civil liberties and resists regular\npaternalism and moralism, not because it won’t take a stand on\nquestions of the good, but precisely because it recognizes autonomy and\nself-determination as higher-order goods. \n\nMill applies his liberal principles to issues of sexual equality\nprimarily in The Subjection of Women. He denounces existing\nforms of sexual inequality in clear and unequivocal terms. \n\n[T]he principle which regulates the existing social relations\nbetween the two sexes—the legal subordination of one sex to the\nother—is wrong in itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to\nhuman improvement; and … it ought to be replaced by a principle\nof perfect equality, admitting no power or privilege on the one side,\nnor disability on the other. (SW 261) \n\nTo modern ears, Mill’s defense of sexual equality may seem obvious,\nand, to some contemporary feminists, Mill’s criticism of sexual\ninequality may not be deep or consistent enough. But, when viewed in\nhistorical context, Mill’s defense of sexual equality is radical,\ncourageous, and sometimes eloquent (Shanley 1998). While Mill clearly\nexpected some aspects of his liberal principles in On Liberty\nto be controversial (OL I 6–8), their revolutionary\nimport only became clear when he applied them to issues of sexual\nequality in The Subjection of Women (Nicholson 1998: 471). \n\nMill rejects sexual inequality in both domestic and social contexts.\nHe discusses domestic equality primarily in Chapter II. There, he\nfocuses on the rights of wives and mothers, recognizing women’s equal\nrights over their bodies or persons (SW 283–86), to own\nand control property (284–85, 297) to control various aspects of\ndomestic decision-making and household management (290–92), to\ncustody and care of children (285), and to separation and divorce\n(285–86). But Mill is not only concerned with wives and mothers\nin domestic contexts. He also defends equal rights to education\n(315–16), to professional opportunities (299; cf. PPE\nIV.vii.3), to vote in political elections (301), and to run for\npolitical office (301). In addition to these rights, Mill presumably\nalso endorses equal rights to freedom of expression, worship, and\nassociation. One assumes that he sees the main threats to these rights\nas occurring in the domestic realm and coming from husbands, fathers,\nand brothers. \n\nAt times, Mill defends sexual equality on explicitly\nconsequentialist grounds as a way of making fuller use of people’s\ntalents and promoting a culture of equal opportunity, accountability,\nand genuine meritocracy (326–28). But Mill also defends sexual\nequality as a matter of individual rights and justice. \n\nThus far, the benefits which it has appeared that the world would\ngain by ceasing to make sex a disqualification for privileges and a\nbadge of subjection, are social rather than individual; consisting in\nan increase of the general fund of thinking and acting power, and an\nimprovement in the general conditions of the association of men and\nwomen. But it would be a grievous understatement of the case to omit\nthe most direct benefit of all, the unspeakable gain in private\nhappiness to the liberated half of the species; the difference to them\nbetween a life of subjection to the will of others, and a life of\nrational freedom. After the primary necessities of food and raiment,\nfreedom is the first and strongest want to human nature. (336) \n\nIn elaborating this claim about women’s higher-order interests in\nliberty, he says that personal independence is an “element of\nhappiness” (336–37). This echoes the arguments in On\nLiberty for claiming that basic liberties are necessary for\npersons to exercise the deliberative capacities that make them\nprogressive beings. \n\nIn defending women’s rights, Mill also appeals to the distinctively\nmodern and progressive commitment to equal opportunity for\nwelfare (272–73). At several points, he likens the status of\nwomen inside and outside of marriage to slavery (284–86, 323).\nMill is not much impressed by those who would dispute the analogy on\nthe ground that women are treated much better than slaves. Gilded cages\nare still cages that restrict freedom and opportunity. And often the\ncages are not gilded; Mill insists that husbands can be and often are\njust as violent and abusive as masters (285–86, 288–89).\nIndeed, with the demise of slavery in America, he views sexual\ninequality as the last vestige of slavery in the West. \n\nThe law of servitude in marriage is a monstrous contradiction to all\nthe principles of the modern world, and to all the experience through\nwhich those principles have been slowly and painfully worked out. It is\nthe sole case, now that negro slavery has been abolished, in which a\nhuman being in the plenitude of every faculty is delivered up to the\ntender mercies of another human being, in the hope forsooth that this\nother will use the power solely for the good of the person subjected to\nit. Marriage is the only actual bondage known to our law. There remain\nno legal slaves, except the mistress of every house. (323) \n\nThe restrictions contained in Victorian marriage law that give\nhusbands complete control over the person and property of their wives\nand that do not allow for unilateral divorce or separation make\nmarriage a form of sexual slavery. Slavery is an impermissible\nrestriction of the liberty of another. Slavery would be impermissible\neven if the wife consented to marriage (270). Mill might question\nwhether the consent is meaningful given the social pressures to marry\nand to defer to their husbands, the limited options for those who do\nnot marry, and the adverse consequences to women of expressing dissent\nwithin marriage (270). But the quality of consent should be in any case\nirrelevant, because we know that Mill thinks that it is impermissible\nto contract into slavery and that paternalistic laws that prevent such\ncontracts are not only permissible but obligatory (OL V 11).\nPresumably, this is just the sort of case that Mill has in mind when he\nsuggests that the prohibition of selling oneself into slavery is a\nprincipled exception to the usual prohibition on paternalism that has\n“wider application.” This norm of equal opportunity for\nwelfare, which is violated by Victorian marriage law, is a demand of\njustice (SW 325) and grounds a claim of right. \n\nMill considers and replies to various actual and possible defenses\nof sexual inequality. In most cases, the apologist for inequality\nalleges that women are naturally inferior in relation to men along some\ndimension that is alleged to be relevant to the proper management of\npersonal and public affairs. For the most part, the apologist claims\nthat men possess some trait essential for normative competence that\nwomen lack—these might be represented as alleged female\ndeficits—or that women possess some trait that men lack\nthat threatens normative competence—these might be represented as\nalleged female disqualifiers. In either case, the apologist\nargues, it turns out that women are naturally inferior and so do not\ndeserve equal treatment. \n\nMill considers a large list of potential natural differences, not\nrestricted to deficits and disqualifiers, including claims that women\nare (1) more intuitive and practical, less principled and theoretical,\nthan men (305), (2) more focused on particulars, less capable of\nabstraction or generalization, than men (306), (3) more nervous and\nexcitable than men (308), (4) less single-minded than men (310), (5)\nless accomplished in philosophy, science, and art than men\n(313–14), (6) less original than men (314–15), (7) morally\nsuperior to men (320–21), (8) more susceptible to personal bias\nthan men (321), (9) more pacific and less aggressive than men\n(329–30), (10) more philanthropic than men (330), and (11) more\nself-sacrificing and self-abnegating than men (293). \n\nMill’s response to these alleged differences is mixed. Sometimes, he\nquestions whether the traits in question are unevenly distributed. But,\nfor the most part, he seems to concede that the traits are unevenly\ndistributed. He doesn’t always agree that the female trait is a deficit\nor disqualifier. For instance, he thinks that being more intuitive,\nmore practical, more focused on particulars, and less rigid allows\nwomen to compensate for deficits in the way that men typically approach\ndecision-making. Women are less likely to follow principle for its own\nsake and are more likely to test principles by their real world\nconsequences. They are better able to multi-task and intellectually\nmore open-minded. Being morally superior and less aggressive are\nunqualified goods. However, he seems to concede that women are more\nexcitable, less accomplished, and less original than men. He tries to\nexplain these deficits and disqualifiers in ways that do not presuppose\nwomen’s natural inferiority. \n\nMill’s primary response to the apologists is to claim that even if\nthe trait is unevenly distributed and functions as a deficit or\ndisqualifier there is nonetheless no evidence of natural inferiority.\nThere is no evidence of natural inferiority, because we cannot be sure\nthat the incapacity is the product of nature, rather than nurture. In\nparticular, because the history of sexual relations has been\ndiscriminatory, we cannot rule out the possibility that female\nincapacity is the product of past discriminatory treatment\n(275–77, 304–05, 313). \n\nI consider it a presumption in any one to pretend to decide what\nwomen are or are not, can or cannot be, by natural constitution. They\nhave always hitherto been kept, as far as regards spontaneous\ndevelopment, in so unnatural a state, that their nature cannot but have\nbeen greatly distorted and disguised; and no one can safely pronounce\nthat if women’s nature were left to choose its direction as freely as\nmen’s, and if no artificial bent were attempted to be given to it\nexcept that required by the conditions of human society, and given to\nboth sexes alike there would be any material difference, or perhaps any\ndifference at all, in the character and capacities that would unfold\nthemselves. (304–05) \n\nMill rightly insists that incapacity that is the product of\ndiscriminatory treatment cannot be appealed to justify that\ndiscrimination. That would be circular reasoning. \n\nMill can explain differential accomplishments in philosophy,\nscience, and the arts by appeal to social barriers to women’s\nparticipation in these fields (313–18) and to competing domestic\ndemands that are placed on them (318–19). In this connection, it\nis worth noting that Mill can concede not only differential\naccomplishments of the sexes but differential capacity, in at least one\nsense. For Mill can and should distinguish between actual\ncapacity and potential capacity. Actual capacities determine\nwhat an agent is now able to do, whereas potential capacities determine\nwhat actual capacities she can develop. For instance, I have no actual\ncapacity to speak Russian, but presumably I do have a potential\ncapacity to speak Russian. By contrast, I don’t have even a potential\ncapacity to fly or run a three-minute mile. Actual capacities are a\nfunction of potential capacities and suitable training, opportunities,\nand responsibilities. If I have not been given a proper education and\ntraining with suitable deliberative opportunities and responsibilities\nat various points in my development, my potential competence may not be\nactualized. Even if everyone had equal potential capacities, we should\nexpect unequal actual capacities in systems where education and\ndeliberative opportunities and responsibilities have been distributed\nunequally. If so, then greater actual capacity would not be evidence of\ngreater potential capacity. \n\nThe moral that Mill draws is that equal rights should prevail in the\nabsence of any good evidence about the way in which natural assets and\npotential capacities are distributed by gender. Equality is the\npresumption, even if it is a rebuttable presumption, and the\npresumption can only be rebutted on the basis of adequate empirical\nevidence (262). \n\nIn rebutting potential defenses of sexual inequality by appeal to\nvarious alleged dimensions of natural inferiority, Mill insists that we\ncannot determine whether traits commonly found in women are the product\nof nature or nurture without suitable social experimentation,\nincluding, the social experiment of sexual equality. In particular,\nthere is the very real possibility that the traits alleged to justify\nsexual discrimination are the product of past discriminatory practice.\nBut Mill does not adhere to this point consistently (see Annas 1977;\nOkin 1979: 226–30). At several points, he expresses the\nconviction that most women with a full menu of opportunities will\naccept a traditional sexual division of labor in which they perform\ndomestic functions while their husbands pursue professions in civil\nsociety, and he approves of this traditional division of labor. \n\nWhen the support of the family depends, not on property, but on\nearning, the common arrangement, by which the man earns the income and\nthe wife superintends the domestic expenditure, seems to me in general\nthe most suitable division of labor between the two persons. …\nIn an otherwise just state of things, it is not, therefore, I think, a\ndesirable custom, that the wife should contribute by her labour to the\nincome of the family. (SW 297) \n\nOf course, Mill is right that a wife should not also have\nto earn a living outside the home if she is working full time within\nthe home. But he gives no reason for thinking that women should have\nfamilies or that, if they do, they, rather than their husbands, should\nbe responsible for matters domestic. Indeed, Mill’s view seems to be\nthat for women extra-domestic vocations should be reserved primarily\nfor those without children or whose children are already grown (338).\nHe seems here to assume that the traditional sexual division of labor\nis natural. Of course, it is possible that the traditional sexual\ndivision of labor would emerge in a system of equal opportunity. But\nthis is conjecture. Indeed, one might have thought that his own claims\nabout how the system of unequal opportunity has repressed women’s\ncreative and managerial capacities would have suggested that the\ntraditional sexual division of labor was probably not robust. In\ndefending or at least speculating about the robustness of the\ntraditional sexual division of labor, Mill appears to be ignoring his\nown methodological strictures. \n\nThis is a significant blemish on Mill’s feminist credentials. He\nsometimes assumed that a traditional sexual division of labor was\nnatural in the sense that it was likely to emerge in a culture of\nequal opportunity for all. Given Mill’s recognition that the existing\ndivision of labor was produced and sustained in conditions of sexual\ndiscrimination and unequal opportunity, there is no basis for\nsupposing that this division of labor would survive a culture of\nequality. However, it is Mill himself that supplies the resources for\ncriticizing his assumption. That ought to provide partial mitigation\nof his mistake. \n\nOtherwise, Mill’s feminist credentials are sterling. He is a keen\ncritic of domestic and social forms of inequality, recognizing the harm\nsuch practices cause women and the ways in which they deform the lives\nof boys and men too. Victorian marriage law, the denial of the\nfranchise, and lack of social and economic opportunities violate\nhigher-order interests of women. These rights violations are a matter\nof serious social injustice. The corollary of these criticisms is that\nMill is a staunch defender of equal opportunity for women and an\neloquent spokesman for the way in which a culture of equality would\ntransform the lives of girls and women, liberating their creative\npotential and emotional sensibilities, and make possible more\nproductive social cooperation and friendships among equals. \n\nMill’s discussion of sexual equality is one place where the\nperfectionist underpinnings of his liberal principles play an important\nrole and add to the depth of his criticisms of sexual discrimination\nand his case for sexual equality. His defense of sexual equality\nhighlights the genuinely progressive aspects of his utilitarian and\nliberal commitments. \n\nAs perhaps the leading historical proponent of two important\nnormative traditions—utilitarianism and liberalism—Mill\noccupies an unusually important position in the history of western\nmoral and political philosophy. Viewed in historical context, both\nutilitarianism and liberalism have exerted considerable progressive\ninfluence on the scope of moral concern, the design of public\ninstitutions, the responsibilities of government, and the interests and\nrights of the governed. Mill did much to articulate the justification,\ncontent, and implications of utilitarian and liberal principles.\nInevitably, there are questions about the proper interpretation,\nadequacy, and consistency of his various claims on these topics. But he\nhas left an enduring legacy in both utilitarian and liberal traditions.\nBoth traditions figure centrally in contemporary discussions of\nanalytical ethical and political theory. Further progress in these\ntraditions must take account of his contributions. \n\nReferences to Mill’s texts and other historical texts will be\nby title or short title; references to contemporary articles and books\nwill be by year of publication. Publication details and\nconventions for referring to Bentham’s and Mill’s texts are\nprovided in this Note (below). Otherwise, publication details can\nbe found in the Bibliography. If a parenthetical reference does\nnot identify the text in question, the reader should assume that it is\nthe last identified text being referenced again (context should make it\nclear). \n\nBentham’s writing were originally published as The Works\nof Jeremy Bentham, 11 vols., ed. J. Bowring (Edinburgh: William\nTait, 1838–43) and are \navailable electronically.\n I refer to the following works, employing the associated\nabbreviations. \n\nSo, for instance, Principles I 2 refers to paragraph 2 of\nchapter I of the Introduction to the Principles of Morals and\nLegislation. \nThere are many editions of Mill’s more popular and\ninfluential works, including many of his writings in moral and\npolitical philosophy. The definitive edition of Mill’s\nwritings is Collected Works of John Stuart Mill [CW],\n33 volumes, ed. J. Robson (Toronto: University of Toronto Press,\n1965–91) and \n  available online through the Liberty Fund.\nIn order to facilitate common reference among readers using different\neditions of his most commonly read texts—Utilitarianism,\nOn Liberty, A System of Logic, and Principles of\nPolitical Economy—I will refer to those works using natural\ndivisions in his texts, such as chapter, section, and/or\nparagraph. Otherwise, I will refer to Mill’s works using\npagination in his Collected Works. I refer to the\nfollowing works, employing the associated abbreviations. \n\nSo, for instance, OL I 11 refers to paragraph 11 of chapter\nI in On Liberty and SL VI.xii.6 refers to book VI,\nchapter xii, section 6 of A System of Logic.","contact.mail":"dbrink@ucsd.edu","contact.domain":"ucsd.edu"}]
