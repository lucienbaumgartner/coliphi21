Jorgensen","entry":"consciousness-17th","body.text":"\n\n\nIn the seventeenth century, “consciousness” began to take\non a uniquely modern sense. This transition was sparked by new\ntheories of mind and ideas, and it connected with other important\nissues of debate during the seventeenth century, including debates\nover the transparency of the mental, animal consciousness, and innate\nideas. Additionally, consciousness was tied closely to moral identity,\nwith both French and Latin lacking even a linguistic distinction\nbetween consciousness and conscience (i.e., a moral sensibility). This\nsemantic shift marked a philosophical division between the\npsychological or phenomenal aspects of thought and a moral sensibility\nas well. The discussions on all of these topics were rich and varied\nin the seventeenth century—the article below provides a view\nfrom forty thousand feet.\n\nTracing the development of consciousness in the early modern period is\ncomplicated by the fact that both Latin and French, the two primary\nlanguages in which philosophy was written, have a single term that\ncould mean either (a) moral conscience, or (b) consciousness. For\nLatin, the term is conscientia; in French it is\nconscience. (The verb and adjective forms are similarly\nambiguous.) These terms were used with both of their major senses\n(along with other minor senses) in the seventeenth century, and so any\ninterpretation of the important texts will have to be sensitive to\nthis potential ambiguity. \nBut, more importantly, the underlying reason for this ambiguity is due\nto the shift in meaning that was taking place during the seventeenth\ncentury. Conscientia and conscience, both of which\nprimarily signified a moral conscience prior to the seventeenth\ncentury, were now taking on a new, purely psychological, meaning. And\nthe philosophers of this period were among the main figures\ninfluencing this shift in meaning.  \nThings aren’t any easier for philosophy written in English or\nGerman, both of which do have a linguistic means of\ndistinguishing the two concepts. The English term\n“consciousness” first became widely used in the\nseventeenth century to mark out this new concept; the German term\n“Bewusstsein” was coined in the early eighteenth century\n(the German word for conscience is “Gewissen”). But even\nwith a new word to identify the concept, the English and German terms\nhad multiple shades of meaning. By 1727, we find an English text\ndefining consciousness as: \n(a) “The reflex Act, by which a Man knows his Thoughts to be his\nown Thoughts,” (b) “the Direct Act of Thinking; or (which\nis of the same Import;) simple Sensation,” or (c) “the\nPower of Self-motion, or of beginning of Motion by the Will”\n(quoted in Thiel 1991, p. 80). \nSo, when reading English philosophical texts it is a tricky matter\nassigning a meaning or analysis to the term. But, of course, this is\ntrue to the nature of the problem. Philosophers of the seventeenth\ncentury were sketching out a concept that remains problematic to this\nday. In today’s discussions of consciousness, it is fairly\ncommon to mark out even further distinctions to identify which aspect\nof the problem one is addressing (creature consciousness, state\nconsciousness, phenomenal consciousness, access consciousness, etc.).\nWhile some have used these later terms to make\nsense of what seventeenth-century philosophers are attempting to\narticulate in their theories, these\nfiner-grained concepts will be for the most part left to today’s philosophers. This entry will instead see\nwhat sense can be made from the seventeenth-century philosophers' own attempts at providing a coherent\nanalysis of consciousness. \n(For a helpful survey of linguistic history the Latin term\nconscientia prior to the seventeenth century, see Hennig\n2007, pp. 466–481. For the transition in seventeenth century\nFrench, see G. Lewis 1950, pp. 111–114. For an account of the\nintroduction of the philosophical term in English, see Thiel 1991. For\na more literary account of the different senses of the terms in Latin\nand Greek, see C.S. Lewis 1960.) \nThe Story. It will be helpful to sketch the narrative arc\nbefore becoming immersed in the details of individual systems. There\nare two significant shifts that will emerge in the discussion below.\nThe first is the one I’ve already indicated: the transition from\nmoral conscience to a purely psychological concept of\nconsciousness—a move from shared knowledge to a notion of\nconsciousness as what is privately introspectable. This starts with\nDescartes and, in England, with the Cambridge Platonists. While this\nis certainly a major development, the central concept remains largely\nunanalyzed. The second shift occurs later in the seventeenth century,\nwhen philosophers start to see consciousness as itself\nsomething to be explained. This latter transition begins with the\nCartesian philosophers who say more about the nature of consciousness\nin their development of Descartes’s system and in order to avoid\nsome of the objections raised against it. But for the most part these\nCartesians remained committed to consciousness as a fundamental\nproperty of the mind, a “mark of the mental.” Leibniz\ncompletes this second transition by arguing that consciousness\ncannot be a mark of the mental. He develops an account of\nmental representation and provides an analysis of consciousness in\nterms of mental representations, arguing that this results in a\nfully natural explanation for something that was otherwise mysterious.\nThis represents the start of an explanatory project that continues to\nthis day: can consciousness be explained in terms of something more\nfundamental? \nA history of consciousness, in its modern sense, properly starts with\nDescartes. While it is true that some ancient and medieval\nphilosophers prefigured some aspects of the modern concept of\nconsciousness (see Heinämaa, et al. 2007), a significant\nshift took place in the seventeenth century, and starting with\nDescartes in particular, that corresponds with the linguistic shift\ndescribe above. So, it is worth asking what it is about\nDescartes’s project that gave rise to a new way of thinking\nabout conscientia. \nIn the Geometric Exposition following the second set of replies to the\nMeditations on First Philosophy (1641), Descartes defines\nthought in the following way: \nThought. I use this term to include everything that is within\nus in such a way that we are immediately aware [conscii] of\nit. Thus all the operations of the will, the intellect, the\nimagination and the senses are thoughts. I say\n‘immediately’ so as to exclude the consequences of\nthoughts; a voluntary movement, for example, originates in a thought.\n(CSM II 113 / AT VII 160; cf. Principles of Philosophy Part\nI, §9 / AT VIIIA 7–8) \nHere, in 1641, we have Descartes defining thought in terms of\nconsciousness—a thought is something “in\nus” of which we are conscious.  \nThere are obvious problems from the start. In what way am I conscious\nof my thoughts? It seems, rather, that I am conscious of\nwhat my thoughts represent. Descartes was well aware of the\ndistinction between a thought and the object of\nthought, and he made use of two technical terms to mark out this\ndistinction. Descartes distinguished between the form of\nthought, which he calls idea: \nIdea. I understand the term to mean the form of any given\nthought, immediate perception of which makes me aware\n[conscius] of the thought. (CSM II 113 / AT VII 160) \nNotice the similar reflective aspect of this: it is the perception\nof an idea that makes me conscious of the thought. But the idea\nis simply the form of the thought itself. The object\nof thought is whatever is represented by the thought. And so,\nDescartes defines the “objective reality of an idea” as\n“the being of the thing which is represented by an idea insofar\nas it exists in the idea…. For whatever we perceive as being in\nthe objects of our ideas exists objectively <or by\nrepresentation> in the ideas themselves” (CSM II 113 /\nAT VII 160).  \nAnd so, as a first pass, it seems that consciousness for Descartes\nentails a perception (that has some content) and a second reflective\nact by which I am aware of the first perception. It seems that the\nreflective aspect of consciousness does remain as a part of\nDescartes’s account of consciousness, but we’ll see that\nit’s less clear just what exactly the “second reflective\nact” is. But it is also the case that Descartes isn’t so\ninterested in an analysis of consciousness as such. We might\nbe looking for an analysis of consciousness; Descartes is not. For\nDescartes, consciousness is taken as given. \nTo see the trajectory from earlier theories of mind, it will be\nhelpful simply to see that, in the cogito argument of the\nFirst and Second Meditations, Descartes sees reason to doubt all\nfeatures of his mind other than what is consciously available\nto him. And even then, his conscious thoughts serve only as evidence\nof his own existence—they don’t give any further evidence\nthat what they represent about things external to him either\nexist at all or exist as represented by the idea in his mind. And so\nconsciousness implicitly becomes, for Descartes, the “mark of\nthe mental” and any further development of theories of mind\nalong these lines will have to consider the role of consciousness in\nthe mental economy. \nThe role of consciousness, for Descartes, is primarily\nepistemic—it makes certain things available to the mind. Three\nparticular aspects of this come to the fore in the\nMeditations: \nEach of these emerge as necessary planks of Descartes’s argument\nin the Meditations. By simply having a thought (e.g.,\n“I am doubting”) I know that I am having a thought and\nthat this necessarily entails that I exist. This inference depends on\nthe transparency of the mental and a reflective act (which Descartes\nfurther emphasizes in the Third Meditation, CSM II 34 / AT VII 49).\nFurther, the intentionality of thought is part of what allows the\nmeditator to infer that he is not alone in the world—he has a\nthought of an infinitely perfect being, and he has other thoughts of\nmaterial objects. From this material—the thoughts and what they\nappear to represent—he is able to infer that God and the\nmaterial world do in fact exist. \nDo these three factors provide us with a full analysis of\nconsciousness? Not entirely. But when pressed to defend these three\naspects of the mind, he gives us more material from which we may infer\nan account of consciousness. For example, Antoine Arnauld, in the\nFourth Set of Objections, raises the following problem for\nDescartes: \nThe author lays it down as certain that there can be nothing in him,\nin so far as he is a thinking thing, of which he is not aware\n[conscius], but it seems to me that this is false. For by\n‘himself, in so far as he is a thinking thing,’ he means\nsimply his mind, in so far as it is distinct from his body. But all of\nus can surely see that there may be many things in our mind of which\nthe mind is not aware [conscius]. The mind of an infant in\nits mother’s womb has the power of thought, but is not aware\n[conscius] of it. And there are countless similar examples,\nwhich I will pass over. (CSM II 150 / AT VII 214) \nArnauld is objecting here to the transparency thesis—there are\ncountless examples, he thinks, of thoughts of which the thinker is not\nconscious (a very interesting admission!). How does Descartes\nrespond? \nAs to the fact that there can be nothing in the mind, in so far as it\nis a thinking thing, of which it is not aware [conscius],\nthis seems to me to be self-evident. For there is nothing that we can\nunderstand to be in the mind, regarded in this way, that is not a\nthought or dependent on a thought. If it were not a thought or\ndependent on a thought it would not belong to the mind qua\nthinking thing; and we cannot have any thought of which we are not\naware [conscius] at the very moment when it is in us. In view\nof this I do not doubt that the mind begins to think as soon as it is\nimplanted in the body of an infant, and that it is immediately aware\n[conscius] of its thoughts, even though it does not remember\nthis afterwards because the impressions of these thoughts do not\nremain in the memory. (CSM II 171–172 / AT VII 246) \nThe possible evidence against the transparency thesis, namely, the\nbaby in the womb, does not tell against it, since failing to\nremember having a conscious thought does not entail that one\ndid not have a conscious thought. But this answer, as a\ndefense of the transparency thesis, raises a problem for reflection.\nIf reflection is necessarily involved in consciousness, for Descartes,\nthen is he here granting that even a fetus can reflect? \nDescartes appears to resist this in his later correspondence with\nArnauld. Arnauld distinguishes “simple reflection” from\n“express reflection,” and argues that although\n“simple reflection” is “intrinsic to all\nthought,” it is distinct from the sort of reflection necessary\nfor intellectual memory and understanding. Descartes responds with his\nown distinction: \n[W]e make a distinction between direct and reflective thoughts\ncorresponding to the distinction between direct and reflective\nvision…. I call the first and simple thoughts of infants direct\nand not reflective…. But when an adult feels [sentio]\nsomething, and simultaneously perceives that he has not felt it before\n[i.e., it involves intellectual memory], I call this second perception\nreflection, and attribute it to the intellect alone, in spite of its\nbeing so linked to sensation that the two occur together and appear to\nbe indistinguishable from each other. (CSM III 357 / AT V\n220–221) \nArnauld, however, preserves this distinction in terms of\nreflection. According to Arnauld,  \n[O]ur thought or perception is essentially\nreflective upon itself: or, as it is said rather better in Latin,\nest sui conscia. For I do not think without knowing that I\nthink. I do not know a square without knowing that I know it. (Arnauld\n71) \nThis reflection that is essential to any thought, however, does not\ninvolve a second order perception. Each thought, according to Arnauld,\nhas reflection built into it—a representation of the\nsubject of thought is an essential part of the content of\neach thought. This is what he calls “simple” or\n“virtual reflection” to distinguish it from the sort of\nreflection that is a result of the subject focusing her attention on\nsome other thought, which does require a second-order thought\ntaking the lower-order thought as its object. (See Nadler 1989,\n118–22 for discussion of this.) \nAlthough Descartes resists attributing reflection, even\nsimple reflection, to infants, Arnauld’s distinction is\nin line with Descartes’s response to another of his objectors.\nPierre Bourdin attempts to raise problems for Descartes on the\nsupposition that consciousness requires a distinct reflective\nthought: \nBy “thinking” you may mean that you understand and will\nand imagine and have sensations, and that you think in such a way that\nyou can contemplate and consider your thought by a reflexive act. This\nwould mean that when you think, you know and consider that you are\nthinking (and this is really what it is to be conscious [conscius\nesse] and to have conscious awareness [conscientia] of\nsome activity). Such consciousness, you claim, is a property of a\nfaculty or thing that is superior to matter and is wholly spiritual,\nand it is in this sense that you are a mind or a spirit. (CSM II 364 /\nAT VII 533–534) \nDescartes denies this inference: \nMy critic says that to enable a substance to be superior to matter and\nwholly spiritual…, it is not sufficient for it to think: it is\nfurther required that it should think that it is thinking, by means of\na reflexive act, or that it should have awareness\n[conscientia] of its own thought. This\nis…deluded…. [T]he initial thought by means of which we\nbecome aware [adverto] of something does not differ from the\nsecond thought by means of which we become aware that we were aware of\nit [per quam advertimus nos istud prius advertisse], any more\nthan this second thought differs from the third thought by means of\nwhich we become aware that we were aware that we were aware. (CSM II\n382 / AT VII 559) \nDescartes does not here deny that reflection is necessary for\nconsciousness. Rather, he is denying that reflection requires a\ndistinct thought. (Note, however, the shift in tense,\n“…we become aware that we were\naware…,” which casts doubt on whether these could be\nidentical thoughts. More on this below.) \nAnd so, in response to these objections Descartes gives us some\nrefinements on his account of consciousness. Consciousness, for\nDescartes, is an intrinsic property of all thoughts (even of the\nthoughts of infants) by which the subject becomes aware of the thought\nitself. While this involves reflection, the reflective thought is not\ndistinct from the initial thought itself. \nThe adjustments Descartes makes in his claims about consciousness have\nled some scholars to conclude that Descartes doesn’t have a\nsingle account of consciousness. Rather, he is working with multiple\ndistinct notions of consciousness (see Radner 1988,\nLähteenmäki 2007, and Simmons 2012). Whether or not he would\nhave been aware of this is unclear. \nSummary. Descartes provides one of the first purely\npsychological uses of the concept of consciousness when he defines\nthought in terms of consciousness. However, he does not provide an\nanalysis of the concept. Rather, he employs the concept in a\nway that grounds his epistemic claims in the Meditations, for\nexample. But the ways in which he employs the concept is suggestive of\nan analysis: a conscious thought is a mental state that is somehow\nself-intimating. And all thoughts, according to Descartes, have this\nbasic property. \nThis sketch of an analysis was bequeathed to Descartes’s\ndisciples, who argued over how best to understand consciousness. It is\nclear that Descartes’s project gives a central role to\nconsciousness, but Descartes nowhere gives us an analysis of this\nbasic concept. Is there anything about consciousness as such\nthat allows it to play this central role? \n(For more on the topic of consciousness and the related topics of\ntransparency of the mental, representation, and reflection in\nDescartes, see Alanen 2003, Broughton 2008, Hennig 2007,\nLähteenmäki 2007, McRae 1972, Radner 1988, Rozemond 2006,\nSimmons 2012, and Wilson 1978. Interpretations of Descartes’s\naccount of consciousness differ significantly. Hennig, for example,\nargues that Descartes is not in fact using the term\nconscientia in a new way. Simmons, on the other hand, argues\nthat Descartes has the resources for a nuanced account of\nconsciousness, allowing for a wide variety of psychological\nphenomena.) \nThree main threads of a psychological sense of conscience\nemerge from this sketch of Descartes’s views, and they\nimmediately generate philosophical controversy.  \nEach of these three sets of questions were taken up and developed in\ndifferent directions by the philosophers that followed Descartes most\nclosely. The Cartesians, as they are called, were divided on each of\nthese issues, and these sets of questions continue with us in one form\nor another to this day. \nMany Cartesians followed Descartes in defining thought in terms of\nconsciousness. Louis de la Forge, who systematized Descartes’s\naccount of the mind, defined thought in this way: \nThought [is] that perception, consciousness [conscience], or\ninner knowledge which each one of us experiences directly in ourselves\nwhen we are aware of [s’aperçevoir de] what we\ndo or of what takes place in ourselves. (La Forge 39) \nAnd later, \n[T]he nature of thought consists [in] that consciousness\n[conscience], testimony [témoignage] and\ninner sensation [sentiment interieur] by which the mind is\naware [averti] of everything it does or suffers and, in\ngeneral, of everything which takes place immediately in itself at the\nsame time as it acts or is acted on. (La Forge 57, translation\naltered) \nNote that here La Forge elaborates on Descartes’s definition. He\ntreats these terms as equivalent: perception, consciousness,\ntestimony, inner sensation. Descartes does not describe consciousness\nin terms of sentiment, and this addition raises important\nquestions—is consciousness simply a kind of sensation? Is it to\ninterior perception what our senses of sight, sound, taste, etc. are\nto the perception of external things? Or is it different in kind? \nMalebranche follows La Forge in this identification. In The Search\nafter Truth, Malebranche uses “consciousness”\n(conscience) and “inner sensation” (sentiment\ninterieur) interchangeably. (See, for example, Book III, Part 2,\nChapter 7, Search 236–239.) Later, he defines thought\nin a way that closely models La Forge’s definition:  \n[B]y the words thought, mode of thinking, or\nmodification of the soul, I generally understand all those\nthings that cannot be in the soul without the soul being aware of them\nthrough the inner sensation it has of itself. (Search\n218) \n(Schmaltz argues that Malebranche was strongly influenced by La Forge\nin his argument here. See Schmaltz 1996, 16ff.)  \nThus, La Forge and Malebranche continue Descartes’s commitment\nto transparency. However, the shift to “interior sense” is\nan important shift, since it marks a shift in the content of\nwhat is transparent to the mind, especially concerning the\nmind’s own nature. Malebranche famously denied Descartes’s\nclaim that the mind is better known than the body. This is due to the\nfact that, although we know body confusedly through our sensations of\nthe external world, we nevertheless have knowledge of the nature of\nbody. (I’ll leave aside Malebranche’s complicated story of\nhow we come to have that knowledge.) But, in the case of the mind, all\nwe have is the internal sense of the mind—we do not know the\nnature of the mind since we have no such concept. Malebranche\nsays: \nIt is true that we know well enough through our consciousness, or the\ninner sensation that we have of ourselves, that our soul is something\nof importance. But what we know of it might be almost nothing compared\nto what it is in itself. (Search 238) \nHe later gives an explanation of why we have knowledge of bodies\nthrough the ideas of bodies, but not so for the soul: \nThe knowledge that we have of our soul through consciousness is\nimperfect, granted; but it is not false. On the other hand, that\nknowledge that we have of bodies through sensation or consciousness,\nif the confused sensation we have of what takes place in our body can\nbe called consciousness, is not only imperfect, but also false. We\ntherefore need an idea of the body to correct our sensations of\nit—but we need no idea of our soul, since our consciousness of\nit does not involve us in error…. (Search 239) \nThus, consciousness, as internal sensation, gives us\nimperfect knowledge of the soul, but it is knowledge that is\nsufficient for all practical (and, importantly for Malebranche,\ntheological) purposes.  \nSo, the subtle shift in the meaning of consciousness to\n“internal sensation” places some limits on what can be\nknown about the mind by means of consciousness. One can be aware\nthat one is thinking, but this does not give us a clear idea\nof the soul. It is not self-knowledge of the same sort. But\nnote also the other shift that this entails—marked by\nMalebranche’s qualification in the passage above. The sensation\nof external objects may not be (properly speaking) consciousness.\nConsciousness is an interior phenomenon, a sensation of what\nis going on in us, and so the visual perception of a red ball\ncan be called consciousness only in a derivative way. This leads us to\nquestions about reflection, taken up in the next thread. \nAs discussed above, already in the Seventh Objections to the\nMeditations, the objection was raised that consciousness\nappears to require a distinct reflective thought. Descartes denied the\ninference, saying that \n[T]he initial thought by means of which we become aware of something\ndoes not differ from the second thought by means of which we become\naware that we were aware of it, any more than this second thought\ndiffers from the third thought by means of which we become aware that\nwe were aware that we were aware. (CSM II 382 / AT VII 559) \nAgain, as noted above, Descartes’s response here is not a denial\nthat reflection is necessary for consciousness—he denies that\nreflection requires a distinct thought. La Forge and\nMalebranche both follow Descartes in this denial (see Schmaltz 1996,\n18). \nBut this passage is somewhat ambiguous. Here Descartes distinguishes\n(1) becoming aware of something, which apparently requires only a\nsingle thought, from (2) becoming aware that we were aware of\nsomething. Apparently, first-order awareness does not require a\nreflective act. And, while becoming aware that we were aware\nof something does require a reflective act, it does not require a\ndistinct thought (and so the threatening regress is not problematic).\nBut it’s not at all clear from this passage how the reflection\ncould be built in to the original thought, especially since there\nappears to be a shift in tenses (the second awareness is temporally\nposterior to the initial awareness). \nAntoine Arnauld develops an account of reflection that incorporates\nthis distinction. The reflection that is essential to any thought does\nnot involve a second order perception. As noted above, Arnauld argued\nthat each thought has reflection built into it, although this\ndoes not entail a second-order thought. Only explicit\nreflection, where an individual focuses their attention on their own\nthoughts, requires a second-order perception. (For more on\nArnauld’s account, see Nadler 1989, 118–22.) \nAs Geneviève Lewis shows, this issue became a critical source\nof debate in the later seventeenth century. She notes that\nPierre-Silvain Régis, in his defense of Cartesianism, commits\nhimself to some sort of reflective knowledge as a constitutive part of\nconsciousness. Régis, like Arnauld, reaches all the way back to\nAugustine as a source for this doctrine, quoting Augustine’s\nclaim that “it is necessary that [an animal] perceives\n(sentio) that it does see when it sees” (Augustine 37,\nquoted by Régis, Système I, 150) When conscious\nof something, one “perceives that one perceives it.” This\nway of putting it was actually quite common as a way of describing the\npsychological sense of consciousness—one not only sees\na red ball, but one also perceives that one perceives the red\nball. This sounds for all the world like a reflective act. \nOn the basis of this, one of the chief opponents to Cartesianism,\nPierre Daniel Huet, argues that the Cartesians are begging the\nquestion. He argues, \nEvery thought involves three things: the thinking mind, the thing\nplaced before the thinking mind [i.e., the object of\nthought], and the action of the thinking mind on the thing placed\nbefore it. (Huet 82) \nDescartes, Huet contends, fails to distinguish these three things in\nthe cogito argument. When Descartes says ego cogito,\nI am thinking, what is the object of thought? His own thought itself.\nBut, and here is the objection, this cannot be the same\nthought as the original thought, “for if it were, the\naction would be turned back upon itself, which is absurd and contrary\nto the natural light so often invoked by Descartes” (83).\nNevertheless, this is the very response Descartes gives in his\nresponse to Bourdin. Why does Huet think this is “absurd and\ncontrary”? \nHuet goes on: \n[I]n order for me to think that I am thinking, two thoughts are\nneeded, with one reflecting on the other—the later, current one\non the previous, earlier one—so that in order for the first\nthought, by which the mind is aware, to be placed before the mind, the\nsecond thought, by which the mind is aware, is of the first thought.\nOr, in short, the first thought will be the end or object of the\nsecond; the second will be the action of the mind whereby it is\ndirected to the first thought. But it is a contradiction that both\nshould occur by a single action… (84) \nIn his reply, Régis argues that this is precisely what is going\non. He argues that we have no need for distinct reflective ideas;\nDescartes “perceives that he thinks by a single and simple idea,\nwhich is known through itself” (Réponse 35; cf.\nSystème I, 150). And then he argues that if a second\nact were necessary then an infinite regress would threaten, since in\norder to be aware of the second thought one would need a third, and so\n on.[4]\n Huet sidesteps this objection with a response drawn from Aquinas:\n“he [Aquinas] admits that thoughts will be multiplied ad\ninfinitum and that the mind is infinite—not in act, but in\npotency” (Huet 86). \nBut underlying all of this is a further, important, difference between\nHuet and the Cartesians. Huet argues that \nThis expression [i.e., “ego cogito”] is\ndefective, for it should be taken to mean, and to be worth as much as\nif I were to say, ‘I am thinking that I was thinking.’ For\nlike the eyes, the human mind can attend to only one thing at a time.\nThus, in order for me to think that I am thinking, two thoughts are\nneeded…. (84) \nIf Huet’s phrase “the human mind can attend to only one\nthing at a time” means that a we can think of only one thing at\na time, then the Cartesians will reject this premise. Indeed,\nDescartes explicitly does so (see CSM III 335 / AT V 149). But\nRégis responds by rejecting the premise that the eye sees only\none thing at a time, reinforcing the analogy between the mind and the\neye. He argues that if thought is to the mind as light is to the eye,\nthen when we see something, there are three distinct aspects of the\nevent: “the eye that sees, the action by which it sees, and the\nobject seen” (Réponse 35). Suppose now that we\nsay, “I see the light.” Must we suppose that there must be\na second light illuminating first? No; we see the light by\nitself. Similarly for thought—if Huet grants the analogy,\nhe “must conclude that [a thought] is known through\nitself” (Réponse 36). \nThe result is that, for the Cartesians, a thought can\n“turn back upon itself,” which is what Huet finds absurd.\nHuet’s objection is that the Cartesians are illicitly smuggling\nin the subject as an object of all thoughts. If so,\nhe argues, then this requires a second thought, which undermines the\ncogito argument. \nAnd so one of the crucial points of clarification for a\ntheory of consciousness is getting straight on whether\nconsciousness involves reflection, and, if so, whether that requires a\ndistinct reflective thought. \nThese considerations of incorrigibility and reflection have\nimplications for the intentionality of thought. Antoine Dilly, another\nCartesian philosopher of the seventeenth century, will bring out some\nof these points. In response to an argument by Ignace Gaston Pardies\nin which Pardies defends a certain kind of knowledge in animals, Dilly\ndefends the Cartesian position. He writes (in 1676): \nTo avoid falling into an equivocation concerning the word\nreflection, it is good to recognize that [a] we can sometimes\nreflect on what we do and [b] sometimes the first thought that we have\nis not only perceived, but when a second thought takes the first for\nits object it happens that we know its nature much better by this\nrepeated inspection. This is even more so since the first thought\nprincipally renders its object present to the soul and by being sensed\ninforms us of its [i.e., the thought’s] presence. But this\nsecond thought has as its object only the first; it shows it to us as\nlively as the first shows us its object. Thus it should not be\nbelieved that each thought is followed by a second that makes it\nknown, because the latter would have to have a third, and so on to\ninfinity. But we are assured, being convinced by our own experience,\nthat all thought is made sensible to the soul, not by any veritable\nreturn on itself, but directly and immediately merely by its presence:\nthus when I see, my vision makes sensible what is, without having need\nfor any other thing. Each person can be much better convinced of this\nby consulting themselves…. (Dilly 116–118) \nThere are two noteworthy elements here. First, Dilly repeats the\narguments we saw in Régis, advancing the view that thoughts are\nknown through themselves rather than requiring a distinct reflective\nthought. Second, Dilly nevertheless characterizes our perception in\nterms of reflection in order to preserve a sense in which the original\nperception “informs us” of its presence (i.e., the\npresence of the idea), by means of which we are aware of the object of\nthought. This is the sort of awareness that Descartes and the\nCartesians have been working to preserve. \nDilly is developing this thought with an eye to dismissing what\nPardies describes as “corporeal knowledge.” As Dilly\nunderstands this, Pardies is saying that an animal can\nperceive something without perceiving that it\nperceives, contrary to the Augustinian slogan mentioned above.\nThat is to say, there may be a representation of the object\nin the animal, but the animal is unaware of the object. Dilly\nresponds:  \nIs it conceivable that [a dog] is led to run to his master by a\ngenuine knowledge that he has of him, without knowing that he\nperceives his master…? How could he identify this man from a\nhundred others that resemble him without perceiving that he sees him\nand is assured, from the inside, that it is him and not some other\nthat he needs to go to for petting? And how does he do all of this\nwithout knowing that he does it? (122) \nUnderlying Dilly’s rhetorical questions about the dog in need of\na good petting is a thesis about intentionality. According to Dilly,\nany attempt to demonstrate that animals have thought must consider how\nthe thought would enter into the passions and actions that the animal\nis experiencing. It is not enough simply to develop an account of\nperception by which the things around the animal are\nimpressed upon it.  \nThe implicit argument here is that there is no genuine\nrepresentation if there is no awareness of the\nrepresentation. Whatever a dog qua machine is acting on when\nrunning to his master, it is not an internal representation of his\nmaster that the dog acts on with purpose. The “corporeal\nknowledge” would be nothing but connections or impressions of\none body on another—without an awareness of these\nimpressions and what they represent, they won’t serve the\npurposes of knowledge, sensation, action, or volition. \nDilly argues that intentionality requires awareness—a thought\ndoes not represent an object unless there is a subject that is aware\nof the representation. And so the consciousness of a thought is\nconceptually prior to its intentionality, which is to say that\nintentionality is simply a kind of\n consciousness.[5]\n But, as we will see, others will argue in the reverse direction.\nIndeed, if a conscious thought is a representation of something\nplus a reflective act, then it seems that the representation\nis conceptually prior to consciousness. What is being worked out\nduring this period is what, exactly, the relation of consciousness,\nrepresentation, and thought really is. And this is something of\nenduring\n interest.[6] \nWhile many philosophers after Descartes took up the issues related to\nconsciousness left by Descartes, one possible exception is Spinoza. On\nsome interpretations, he doesn’t have much to say at all about\n consciousness.[7]\n This is somewhat striking, given how much Spinoza had to say about\nideas and the mind. However, this may be a reflection of just how thin\nSpinoza’s attribute of thought really is, bringing together what\nin Descartes were distinct concepts: will and intellect, judgment and\nperception, and the like, developing a fully naturalized account of\nthe mind. And so it seems that, insofar as Spinoza has a theory of\nconsciousness, it will be explained in terms of some other more\nfundamental feature of the mind. \nSpinoza’s theory of mind is a thoroughly\nrepresentational theory of mind. The mental consists simply\nin representational content, for Spinoza. In Ethics 2p7, he\nargues that “the order and connection of ideas is the same as\nthe order and connection of\n things,”[8]\n which is to say that for each extended object, there is a parallel\nidea. This is called mind-body parallelism. From this Spinoza is able\nto develop his theory of mind: “The first thing that constitutes\nthe actual being of a human mind is nothing but the idea of a singular\nthing which actually exists” (2p11). Each mind is itself an idea\nwith a particular object—in the case of humans, the mind is the\nidea of its body, and whatever happens in the body will be represented\nin the mind (as he argues in 2p12 and 2p13). The mind is a particular\nidea that represents a singular object, namely, the body that it is\nparallel to. This is a fully representational theory of mind, and\nanything else that can be inferred from the mind will have its\nparallel in the body that it represents. (For more on Spinoza’s\nrepresentational theory of mind, see Della Rocca 1996.) \nSo, of the three main threads discussed above, it seems that the\nintentionality of thought is the primary pivot on which everything\nelse turns for Spinoza’s theory of mind. There are suggestions\nin Spinoza’s Ethics that he thinks there are some\nrepresentations of which we are unaware. At the end of the\nEthics, Spinoza describes the “wise man” as the\none who is “conscious of himself, and of God, and of\nthings” (5p42s), the clear implication being that those who\naren’t wise fail to be conscious of themselves, God, or\nthings, even if these things are present to mind through a mental\nrepresentation. And so, it seems that Spinoza needs an account of\nconsciousness that does not extend to every mental representation (or,\nat the very least, not to the same degree). \nAs the reference to the “wise man” above suggests,\nSpinoza’s primary use of the term “consciousness” is\nmoral, but he is making a significant departure from the older sense\nof the term as “moral conscience.” There is no inner\ntestimony that Spinoza thinks we should heed. Rather, he is focusing\nour attention on how we think of ourselves as a part of the\nnatural order. He uses this concept to draw together his moral,\nepistemological, and metaphysical projects. \nIt is significant that Spinoza rarely used the term\nconscientia (in its various forms) in the Ethics,\nand when he does it is almost exclusively in parts 3 through 5, where\nSpinoza is considering the nature of specifically human affects and\nbondage or freedom with respect to them. Indeed, the few times Spinoza\nuses conscientia in Parts 1 and 2, he does so in a way that\npoints forward to its use in the later part of the\n Ethics.[9] \nThe proposition in which the term conscientia gets the widest\nuse is 3p9: \nP9: Both insofar as the Mind has clear and distinct ideas, and\ninsofar as it has confused ideas, it strives, for an indefinite\nduration, to persevere in its being and it is conscious of this\nstriving it has. \nDem.: …since the Mind (by IIp23) is conscious of itself through\nideas of the Body’s affections, the Mind (by p7) is conscious of\nits striving. \nSchol.: When this striving is related only to the Mind, it is called\nWill; but when it is related to the Mind and Body together, it is\ncalled Appetite. This Appetite, therefore, is nothing but the very\nessence of man, from whose nature there necessarily follow those\nthings that promote his preservation. And so man is determined to do\nthose things. \nBetween appetite and desire there is no difference, except that desire\nis generally related to men insofar as they are conscious of their\nappetite. So desire can be defined as appetite together\nwith consciousness of the appetite. \nThe “content” of consciousness—what it is we are\nconscious of when we have a mental state with the form\narticulated in 3p9, is best expressed by the following quotation from\nthe appendix to Part 1: \n[A]ll men are born ignorant of the causes of things, and…they\nall want to seek their own advantage, and are conscious of this\nappetite. \nFrom these [assumptions] it follows, first, that men think\nthemselves free, because they are conscious of their volitions and\ntheir appetite, and do not think, even in their dreams, of the causes\nby which they are disposed to wanting and willing, because they are\nignorant of [those causes]. It follows, secondly, that men\nact always on account of an end, viz. on account of their advantage,\nwhich they want.  \nThe transition Spinoza is attempting to effect in his readers is a\ntransition from this sort of consciousness—where we\nfalsely regard ourselves as free, we think of the world as having a\nrich and extensive teleology, and we think of ourselves as agents\nfreely acting on purposes and ends—to another sort of\nconsciousness in which we know ourselves to be part of an\n“eternal necessity” (5p42s). As Spinoza puts it: \nTherefore, the more each of us is able to achieve this kind of\nknowledge [i.e., the third kind of knowledge], the more he is\nconscious of himself and of God, i.e., the more perfect and blessed he\nis. (5p31s) \nAnd so the role of consciousness for Spinoza is primarily\nmoral—the moral transition is a transition in the content of our\nconsciousness. But, as already noted, this appears to require some\nvariation between what is strictly represented by the mind and the way\nit appears to the mind in consciousness. To get at this difference,\nwe’ll need to look more closely at the form of\nconsciousness for\n Spinoza.[10] \nAt the beginning of the previous section, we noted that Spinoza rarely\nuses the term conscientia, and when he does it is primarily\nin parts 3 through 5. This claim, while true, is somewhat misleading.\nNote that the quotation above from 3p9 refers us back to 2p23 for his\nclaims about consciousness. And again in 3p30d, 3def.aff1, and 4p8d\nSpinoza refers us back to 2p23, 19, or 21. It seems clear that he\nintends 2p19 through 23 to have some consequence for his theory of\nconsciousness, and so many commentators have tried to develop an\naccount of consciousness from what Spinoza says in that section of the\nEthics. \n2p23 does not say anything about consciousness as such. Instead, it\ndescribes the way the mind knows itself and the limits on the\nmind’s knowledge of itself. Here is what Spinoza says: \nP23: The Mind does not know itself, except insofar as it perceives\nthe ideas of the affections of the Body. \nDem.: The idea, or knowledge of the mind (by P20) follows in\nGod in the same way, and is related to God in the same way as the\nidea, or knowledge, of the body. But since (by P19) the human\nMind does not know the human Body itself, i.e. (by P11C), since the\nknowledge of the human Body is not related to God insofar as he\nconstitutes the nature of the human Mind, the knowledge of the Mind is\nalso not related to God insofar as he constitutes the essence of the\nhuman Mind. And so (again by P11C) to that extent the human Mind does\nnot know itself. \nNext, the ideas of the affections by which the Body is affected\ninvolve the nature of the human Body itself (by P16), i.e. (by P13),\nagree with the nature of the Mind. So knowledge of these ideas will\nnecessarily involve knowledge of the Mind. But (by P22) knowledge of\nthese ideas is in the Mind itself. Therefore, the human Mind, to that\nextent only, knows itself, q.e.d. \nMany of the crucial phrases are ambiguous here, but as a first\nattempt, we might say that Spinoza is arguing for the following\nthesis: \nA mind has a conscious thought of P iff \nThis is one way to make sense of “perceiv[ing] the ideas of the\naffections of the Body.” Edwin Curley presents such an\ninterpretation of this passage (Curley 1969, 128). The benefit of this\ntheory of consciousness is that it is thoroughly representational, and\nso it is consistent with Spinoza’s general project of developing\na representational theory of mind. Further, this theory would seem to\nentail that not all minds are conscious (or that not all thoughts are\nconscious)—Spinoza suggests that infants are not conscious in\n5p6s and 5p35s \nDespite these advantages, this initial understanding of this passage\nhas fallen under heavy fire. Margaret Wilson has objected to this\nreading by arguing that it does not provide a satisfactory way of\ndistinguishing between conscious and non-conscious minds or conscious\nand non-conscious thoughts. Since, in God, there must be ideas of all\nideas, any given idea (and any given mind) will have the necessary\nsecond idea (or even infinitely many—see 2p21s) that would\nrender it conscious. (See Wilson, 134–138 for further\nobjections.) Jonathan Bennett puts forward similar objections,\nconcluding that if this is Spinoza’s account of consciousness,\nit is “absurdly excessive” (Bennett 188). Curley concedes\nthe point (see Curley 1988, 71–72). \nOthers have tried to rehabilitate this interpretation and respond to\nthe potential objections. Lee C. Rice (1990) and Christopher Martin\n(2007) both offer responses to the objections and attempt to defend\nthis interpretation of Spinoza’s theory of consciousness. Their\nefforts at making sense of 2p19–23 are interesting, but it is\nnot easy from this section of the text to avoid the “absurdly\nexcessive” conclusions. Of course, one could simply bite the\nbullet here and say that Spinoza is in fact “absurdly\nexcessive”! He is committed to panpsychism, why not take the\nshort step to a similarly extensive account of consciousness? Indeed,\nthe next set of interpretations are prepared to go that far.  \nDespite the explicit reference to the “ideas of ideas”\npassages in later discussions of consciousness, Stephen Nadler (2008)\nand Don Garrett (2008) think this is the wrong place to look for\nSpinoza’s theory of consciousness. Instead, they develop their\ninterpretations from the thesis of mind-body parallelism. \nWhile Nadler is inclined to think that Spinoza does not have\na full-blown account of consciousness, what Spinoza does offer is\n“very suggestive…for a particular kind of project, one\nthat represents a naturalistic account of consciousness that is\nprecocious in so far as it points the way to just the kind of\nempirical, scientific inquiry into consciousness that characterizes\ncontemporary neuroscience and (some) recent philosophy of mind”\n(586). Quoting 2p13s and 5p39s, Nadler argues that the feature that is\nbeing tracked by the mind in consciousness is the structural\ncomplexity of the body. 5p39s reads as follows: \n[H]e who, like an infant or child, has a Body capable of very\nfew things, and very heavily dependent on external causes,\nhas a Mind which considered solely in itself is conscious of almost\nnothing of itself, or of God, or of things. On the other hand, he who\nhas a Body capable of a great many things, has a Mind which considered\nonly in itself is very much conscious of itself, and of God, and of\nthings. \nIn this life, then, we strive especially that the infant’s Body\nmay change (as much as its nature allows and assists) into another,\ncapable of a great many things and related to a Mind very much\nconscious of itself, of God, and of things. \nFrom these passages, Nadler concludes that “human or higher\nconsciousness for Spinoza is nothing but the mental correlate of the\nsuperlative complexity of the human body” (587). The result is\nthat consciousness, for Spinoza, is a matter of degree (as is\nsuggested in the passage above). Nadler also suggests the possibility\nthat this could be a threshold concept—that there is a minimum\ndegree of complexity that must be satisfied before a mind could be\nconscious. But, citing Garrett’s appeal to Spinoza’s\nnaturalism, he dismisses the threshold view. And so, consciousness\ncomes in degrees, and all minds have it (contrary to the worries in\nthe ideae idearum\n section).[11] \nDon Garrett draws from the same texts as Nadler, but what he\nemphasizes in these passages is the difference in ability.\nNote in the above passage that Spinoza talks of the infant body as one\n“capable of very few things.” And so the underlying\nfeature that consciousness tracks, according to Garrett, is the\nrelative power of the body (23–24). The more power a\nbody has, the greater the degree of consciousness in the mind.  \nThe problem with this view, according to Nadler, is that “all\nthat Garrett is warranted in concluding from his argument and the\ncentral passages in question is that degrees of consciousness and\ndegrees of power of thinking in a mind vary proportionately, but not\nthat consciousness is itself identical to power of\nthinking” (592–93). However, given Spinoza’s\nrepresentational account of mind, the only two features that stand out\nas candidates for explaining consciousness are some features of the\nrepresentations themselves (their complexity) or the causal efficacy\nof the ideas (their power). (Cf. Della Rocca 2008 108–118.) \nMichael LeBuffe has argued that the central passages on which most\nscholars have developed their interpretations should not be\nread as proposing a theory of consciousness; rather, these passages\nare focused on “the epistemological status of certain elements\nof conscious experience.” Nevertheless, he does recognize that\nSpinoza requires a theory of consciousness and raises a particular\nproblem for Garrett’s interpretation. On Garrett’s\ninterpretation, the power of a mind and the power of its constituent\nideas could diverge. That is, there could be a very powerful mind\n(which is conscious to a high degree) whose ideas are relatively less\npowerful (of which the mind is conscious to a very low degree). That\nis, on Garrett’s view, it is possible for a more powerful mind\n(as a whole) to have ideas all of which are less conscious than the\nideas in a less powerful mind, in which case it would be odd to\ndescribe the more powerful mind as having a higher degree of\nconsciousness (LeBuffe 2010, 557). LeBuffe argues to the contrary that\nSpinoza does not characterize the power of a mind (as a whole) in\nterms of its level of consciousness. \nEugene Marshall has proposed a development of Garrett’s\ninterpretation, which reduces consciousness to\n“affectivity” (see Marshall 2014, chapter 4).\n“Affectivity” is the property an idea has when it\nincreases, decreases, or fixes the power of the mind’s striving\n(its “conatus”) or when it moves the mind to act. Emotions\nsuch as joy or fear would be affective in this way, but so would\ncertain rational judgments. Marshall argues that this provides a more\ndeveloped account of how power is centrally involved in consciousness\nfor Spinoza while avoiding some of the problems of Garrett’s\nproposal. \nSo far the discussion has centered on continental Europe. But there\nwere similar developments towards a theory of consciousness in\nEngland. \nAt the beginning of the seventeenth century, we find Hobbes giving the\ntraditional definition of consciousness: \nWhen two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to\nbe CONSCIOUS of it one to another; which is as much as to know it\ntogether. And because such are fittest witnesses of the facts of one\nanother, or of a third; it was, and ever will be reputed a very evil\nact, for any man to speak against his conscience; or to\ncorrupt or force another to do so…. Afterwards, men made use of\nthe same word metaphorically, for the knowledge of their own secret\nfacts, and secret thoughts; and therefore it is rhetorically said,\nthat the conscience is a thousand witnesses. (Leviathan\n7.4) \nThe etymological sense of consciousness of shared knowledge\nis preserved here and connected with the function of conscience as a\nwitness. Indeed, it is important to Hobbes to preserve this public\nsense of consciousness/conscience, since he viewed the private\njudgments of conscience to be “repugnant to civil society”\n(Leviathan 29.7). \nAnd yet, quite apart from the term consciousness, it seems that Hobbes\nhas an account of phenomenal awareness: \n[I]f the appearances be the principles by which we know all other\nthings, we must needs acknowledge sense to be the principle by which\nwe know those principles, and that all the knowledge we have is\nderived from it. And as for the causes of sense, we cannot begin our\nsearch of them from any other phenomenon than that of sense itself.\nBut you will say, by what sense shall we take notice of sense? I\nanswer, by sense itself, namely, by the memory which for some time\nremains in us of things sensible, though they themselves pass away.\nFor he that perceives that he hath perceived, remembers. (De\nCorpore 25.1, p. 389; for some discussion of this text, see Frost\n2005) \nWe must be cautious about attributing a theory of consciousness (in\nthe modern day sense) to Hobbes here. In particular, we should be\ncautious of what is meant by sensing that we have sensed, since\nsensation is itself an appearance, which, presumably, one\nwould be aware of. But these appearances are connected together into a\nsingle experience by memory. As Hobbes says in Leviathan,\n“much memory, or memory of many things, is called\nexperience” (2.4). But phenomenal awareness seems to be\na property of sensation itself, for Hobbes. Hobbes resists the\nimplication of a higher-order account of consciousness in his\nobjections to Descartes’s Mediations (cf. CSM II,\n122–123 / AT VII 173; for discussion of the relation of Hobbes\nand Descartes on the topic of consciousness, see Ross 1988). \nThe shifting use of conscientia has here been traced through\nthe Cartesian line. However, a largely independent line developed\nthrough the Cambridge Platonists (as is argued in Thiel 1991), and in\nparticular in the writings of Ralph Cudworth.  \nCudworth developed his theory by reflecting on Plotinus’s\nEnneads, where Plotinus makes use of the Greek term\nsynaisthesis (literally: “sensed with”) to\ndistinguish lower natures from higher. Cudworth translates this into\nEnglish as “con-sense” or\n“consciousness” (True Intellectual\nSystem 159). It is by working out a particularly Platonic\nmetaphysical theory that Cudworth develops his account of\nconsciousness. \nCudworth, along with other Cambridge Platonists, argued for\n“plastic natures,” which are immaterial sources of action\nin the world. These plastic natures are similar to minds or souls,\nbut, pace Descartes, Cudworth allowed that there are\nnon-conscious thoughts and non-conscious plastic natures. Against\nDescartes’s argument that all mental states are conscious,\nCudworth argues as follows (True Intellectual System\n160): \nAnd so there is much in the soul (and especially in other principles\nof life) that we know nothing about and cannot account for\nmechanically (ibid). Unlike Spinoza and Leibniz (below),\nCudworth does not have the same interest in articulating a\n“natural” account of consciousness or mental activity,\nsince the plastic natures themselves are sources of divine\nactivity and providence. \nNevertheless, the role consciousness plays in Cudworth’s system\nis a similar awareness of one’s own thought that is distinct\nfrom the moral conscience. While consciousness does contain a\nreference to the subject of thought, for Cudworth, it does not do so\nimmediately or explicitly. It takes a distinct act of reflection in\norder to provide the sort of self-reference necessary for making moral\njudgments about one’s own actions (Thiel 1991 92–24). (For\nmore on Cudworth’s account of consciousness, see Thiel 1991 and\nLähteenmäki 2010.) \nJohn Locke famously makes use of consciousness in his theory of\npersonal identity, separating personal identity from identity of\nsubstance or identity of matter. This is a purely psychological\naccount of identity, which has implications for judgments of moral\nresponsibility (which Locke does develop), but consciousness\nitself is not to be equated with the moral sensibility.  \nLocke’s definition of “person” contains in it a\ndefinition of consciousness: \n[A person] is a thinking intelligent Being, that has reason\nand reflection, and can consider it self as it self, the same thinking\nthing in different times and places; which it does only by that\nconsciousness, which is inseparable from thinking, and as it seems to\nme essential to it: It being impossible for any one to perceive,\nwithout perceiving, that he does perceive. (Essay 2.27.9) \nHere again we find commitments to the transparency of the mental and\nconnections between consciousness and reflection. The identification\nof consciousness with “perceiving that [one] does\nperceive” raises again the specter of the higher-order\n interpretation.[12]\n But there are good reasons to think that a higher-order theory\nwon’t work for Locke (see Coventry and Kriegel 2008 and Weinberg\n2008). In just about every section of this entry, we have encountered\nsomeone as interpreting the relevant philosopher as a\nhigher-order theorist. But repeatedly this suggestion is countered\nexplicitly by the philosopher himself or implicitly by an obvious\nincoherence with other basic principles. One might hope that the\nfrequent objections in the literature will put an end to such\n speculations.[13]\n While expressions of accounts of consciousness in the seventeenth\ncentury might sound a lot like today’s higher-order theories of\nconsciousness, there are almost always alternative ways of construing\nthe accounts that are more faithful to what’s going on at the\ntime. \nRather, in Locke’s case, it seems that the analysis of\nconsciousness allows only the inference that thoughts are\nself-intimating. “When we see, hear, smell, taste,\nfeel, meditate, or will any thing, we know that we do so”\n(2.27.9). And yet there has been a long history arguing that Locke\nequates consciousness and reflection (for this history of this\ninterpretation, see Kulstad 84–85). Of course, even if\nLocke’s account of consciousness necessarily involves\nreflection, we have seen that this doesn’t immediately entail a\nhigher-order theory. But, as Mark Kulstad argues, there is good reason\nto think that Locke distinguishes consciousness from reflection. One\ncan be conscious of something (namely, a sensible quality) without\nthereby reflecting on it (Kulstad\n 87–91).[14] \nFurther, like Descartes, Locke argues that this is the essence of\nthought—one can’t have a thought without “being\nconscious of it” (2.1.19). However, he will extend this idea\nonly as far as experience will allow—it is not at all clear to\nhim that “the soul always thinks,” since we often fail to\nhave conscious experience while asleep. And so, as Locke says,\n“every drowsy nod shakes their doctrine, who teach that the soul\nis always thinking” (2.1.13; see 2.1.10–20 for the full\nargument). This argument resembles that offered by Cudworth, and, like\nCudworth, Locke will conclude that thinking is not the essence of the\nsoul. The soul can persist through a state in which there is no\nthinking—this is the beginning of his separation of the\nunderlying substance from its psychological states. The consciousness\nof an individual bears no necessary relation to the substance it\ninheres in, and so the substance contributes nothing to the identity\nof the individual.  \nShelley Weinberg has argued for an interpretation of Locke’s\ntheory of consciousness that she thinks solves many of the most\npressing problems of interpretation. According to Weinberg, for Locke,\n \nConsciousness is self-consciousness. It is a non-evaluative\nself-referential form of awareness internal to all perceptions of\nideas. It is the perception that I am perceiving an idea, or the\nperception of myself as perceiving an idea. (xi)  She takes Locke’s account to entail that every act of\nperception is a complex state involving ”at the very least, an\nact of perception, an idea perceived, and consciousness (that I am\nperceiving)“ (xi).  Her defense of this view shows how such an\naccount of consciousness helps make sense of Locke’s claims\nabout the knowledge of one’s own existence, the knowledge of\nexternal objects, personal identity, and moral agency (Weinberg\n2016). \nReturning to the Continent, we find that Leibniz may be the first\nphilosopher we’ll encounter that can properly be said to have a\ntheory of consciousness. Leibniz is one of the first\nphilosophers to make it very explicit that he is trying to work out an\nanalysis for this new psychological account of consciousness. He even\ninvents a new word for the concept: apperception, a\nnominalization of the French verb s’apercevoir de, to\nperceive. And along with this new term, he develops a theory of\nconsciousness that he intends to be fully naturalized, which, in part,\nmeans that there are no unexplained gaps in the analysis that require\nrecourse to brute explanation or miracle. \nFurther, Leibniz is one of the first to provide a theoretical\ngrounding for non-conscious mental states, in contrast to the\nCartesians we discussed above who defined thought in terms of\nconsciousness. As Leibniz says,  \n[I]t is good to distinguish between perception, which is the\ninternal state of the monad [i.e., simple substance] representing\nexternal things, and apperception, which is\nconsciousness, or the reflective knowledge of this internal\nstate, something not given to all souls, nor at all times to a given\nsoul. Moreover, it is because they lack this distinction that the\nCartesians have failed, disregarding the perceptions that we do not\napperceive, in the same way that people disregard imperceptible\nbodies. This is also what leads the same Cartesians to believe that\nonly minds are monads, that there are no souls in beasts, still less\nother principles of life. (“Principles of Nature and\nGrace” §4, AG 208) \nThus, Leibniz thinks he has diagnosed a significant error in the\nCartesian philosophical system, and he has the solution in his account\nof consciousness. A couple of things stand out immediately from this\npassage, which connect to our discussion above: \nSo, like Spinoza, Leibniz will have to provide a theory of\nconsciousness in terms of representations, and, perhaps\nunlike Spinoza, he will have to demonstrate how this theory allows for\ntransitions from conscious to non-conscious states. If he can do this,\nthen, he thinks, his theory of mind will avoid many of the problems\nplaguing the Cartesian theory of mind. Further, he thinks it will be a\nfully natural theory, one that will open up a new science of the mind,\nwhich he calls pneumatology (cf. RB 56; the name\npneumatology obviously didn’t catch on, but the science\nLeibniz envisioned would probably overlap significantly with\ntoday’s cognitive\n sciences).[15] \nSo, then, what was the account of consciousness Leibniz had to offer?\nSome have picked up on what Leibniz says in the quotation above\n(“…apperception, which is\nconsciousness, or the reflective knowledge of this internal\nstate”) and argue that consciousness, for Leibniz, is a matter\nof reflection. And, as we have seen, this is a popular option during\nthe seventeenth century, but it is also an option for which it is not\nalways clear what the underlying structure would be. Does reflection\nrequire a distinct second-order perception that takes the first-order\nperception as its object? Or is it rather like Arnauld’s\nsuggestion of a virtual reflection (in contrast to an\nexplicit reflection)? Many scholars believe that Leibniz is\narguing for higher-order theory of consciousness, where consciousness\nis constituted by a first-order perception and a distinct higher-order\nperception. (For this sort of an interpretation of Leibniz’s\ntheory of consciousness, see Kulstad 1990, Gennaro 1999, and Simmons\n2001.) \nIn fact, Leibniz’s purported analysis of consciousness in terms\nof reflection isn’t entirely clear. If Leibniz is\narguing that a perception becomes a conscious perception when\nit is accompanied by a second-order perception, then Leibniz has a\nphilosophical problem. Margaret Wilson’s argument against\nCurley’s similar analysis of Spinoza’s theory of\nconsciousness above applies even better to Leibniz. Leibniz’s\ntheory of mind entails that every mind represents the universe (the\n“universal expression” thesis), which would always\nnecessarily include a self-expression. All minds would have\nhigher-order perceptions of themselves and their mental states,\nundermining Leibniz’s ability to distinguish among\nconscious/non-conscious substances or conscious/non-conscious\nperceptions within a single substance. All substances would\nbe conscious, and all mental states would be conscious mental states.\n(For a development of these criticisms as well as an argument that a\nhigher-order theory of consciousness would violate one of\nLeibniz’s basic metaphysical theses, see Jorgensen 2009. For a\npossible response (but not decisive) to some of these objections, see\nJorgensen 2011a.) \nOf course, it may be that Leibniz simply didn’t see this\nimplication and so he held an incoherent theory of consciousness. But\nthere is another candidate theory in the near neighborhood. Consider\nwhat Leibniz says about simple substances (or, as he calls them,\n“monads”) in the following passage: \n[S]ince the nature of the monad is representative, nothing can limit\nit to represent only a part of things. However, it is true that this\nrepresentation is only confused as to the detail of the whole\nuniverse, and can only be distinct for a small portion of things, that\nis, either for those that are closest, or for those that are greatest\nwith respect to each monad, otherwise each monad would be a divinity.\nMonads are limited, not as to their objects, but with respect to the\nmodifications of their knowledge of them. Monads all go confusedly to\ninfinity, to the whole; but they are limited and differentiated by the\ndegrees of their distinct perceptions. (“Monadology,”\n§60, AG 220–221) \nLeibniz here starts by articulating the universal expression\nthesis—all simple substances represent “the whole.”\nWhat distinguishes them from one another is the relative\n“degrees of their distinct perceptions,” which track the\nthings that “are closest, or…greatest with respect to\neach monad.” Combining what Leibniz says here with other similar\ntexts, we see Leibniz articulating a broadly functional account of\nconsciousness. Consciousness is a function of perceptual distinctness,\nwhich itself is a function of how things are represented in the\nindividual monad. \nTo see how perceptual distinctness arises from a variety of\nrepresentations, Leibniz provides his famous example of the sound of\nthe ocean: \nTo give a clearer idea of these minute perceptions which we are unable\nto pick out from the crowd, I like to use the example of the roaring\nnoise of the sea which impresses itself on us when we are standing on\nthe shore. To hear this noise as we do, we must hear the parts which\nmake up this whole, that is the noise of each wave, although each of\nthese little noises makes itself known only when combined confusedly\nwith all the others, and would not be noticed if the wave which made\nit were by itself. (RB 54) \nEach tiny wave sound impresses itself on our sensory organs and are\nthen combined into a more noticeable sound, one that will stand out\nfrom the rest of the background representations of the world.\n“Noticeable perceptions,” Leibniz says, “arise by\ndegrees from ones which are too minute to be noticed” (RB\n57). \nThe way in which distinct perceptions arise depends on the\nfunctional organization of the body. In the “Principles of\nNature and Grace,” Leibniz says that when a simple substance has\na body with “organs that are adjusted in such a way that,\nthrough them, there is contrast and distinction among the impressions\nthey receive, and consequently contrast and distinction in the\nperceptions that represent them…then this may amount to\nsensation…” (AG 208). The contrast in noticeable\nperceptions arises because of the function of the body\n“confusing” (that is, fusing together) the representations\nof the external world in such a way that they become more distinctive.\nSo, although they are confused, these perceptions stand out against\nthe perceptual background—they are confused and\ndistinct. When and how this occurs will depend on a variety of\nfactors, including the ability and sophistication of the sense organs,\nthe disposition of the individual, etc. Additionally, this will be a\nmatter of degree—certain representations will stand out more\nthan others. And so, for Leibniz, consciousness itself will be a\nmatter of\n degree.[16] \nHowever, in order for Leibniz to account for transitions in\nconsciousness (whether it’s a mind becoming conscious or whether\nit is a transition in a mind becoming conscious of a particular\nobject) it cannot be the case that just any degree of\nperceptual distinctness results in consciousness. Rather,\nLeibniz’s theory of consciousness appears to entail that there\nis a certain minimal threshold at which consciousness arises. And this\nthreshold might itself be sensitive to context and the status of the\nmind—things that I’ll notice when I’m wide awake\nwill go unnoticed when I’m in a sound sleep. Here is one example\nthat Leibniz provides, along with his explanation: \n[T]here are hundreds of indications leading us to conclude that at\nevery moment there is in us an infinity of perceptions, unaccompanied\nby awareness [apperception] or reflection; that is, of\nalterations in the soul itself, of which we are unaware because these\nimpressions are either too minute and too numerous, or else too\nunvarying, so that they are not sufficiently distinctive on their own.\nBut when they are combined with others they do nevertheless have their\neffect and make themselves felt, at least confusedly, within the\nwhole. This is how we become so accustomed to the motion of a mill or\na waterfall, after living beside it for awhile, that we pay not heed\nto it. Not that this motion ceases to strike on our sense-organs, or\nthat something corresponding to it does not still occur in the soul\nbecause of the harmony between the soul and the body; but these\nimpressions in the soul and the body, lacking the appeal of novelty,\nare not forceful enough to attract our attention and\nour memory, which are applied only to more compelling objects. (RB\n53–54) \nNote that Leibniz here reaffirms that we are aware only of the\nperceptions that are “sufficiently distinctive” or are\n“forceful enough.” This suggests a certain level of\nperceptual distinctness or force that will “make themselves\nfelt.” As in the case of the mill—you move in next door to\nthe mill and can’t sleep because of the noise. But, over time,\nyou become accustomed to the sound of the mill and no longer notice\nit. It is this sort of phenomenological fact, which we can all\nrecognize, that Leibniz thinks he can explain in terms of the\nvariations in perceptual distinctness. It’s not, as he says,\nthat the noise no longer affects our sensory organs—the noise\ncontinues to be registered internally, but there is something about\nthe lack of novelty that results in a transition in consciousness. We\nno longer notice the noise (or, at the very least, we don’t\nnotice it nearly as much). What explains this? Leibniz thinks he can\ngive a natural explanation of this in terms of the forcefulness of the\nimpression. Somehow it becomes less forceful over time. (How does it\ndo this? Leibniz doesn’t give us a full account here. This is where he thinks we will see the promise of his theory and\nthen investigate the\n causes.)[17] \nThus, Leibniz may be seen as providing a fully naturalized\nphilosophy of mind in which he advocates for a threshold theory of\nconsciousness. This is a same-order theory of\nconsciousness—for Leibniz, a conscious perception is a distinct\nperception. That is, at some level of distinctness, the perception\nstands out sufficiently to be noticed. All perceiving substances have\nperceptions that have some degree of distinctness, but not all\nperceiving substances have distinct perceptions. Rather, it requires\nsome threshold degree of distinctness (relative to context) for a\nperception to be distinct. (For a full account of this position, see\nch. 7 of Jorgensen 2019.) \nLeibniz never uses the term “threshold” when discussing\nconsciousness, but his examples all appeal to thresholds in one way or\nanother. He says later in the New Essays: \nI…prefer to distinguish between perception and\nbeing aware [apperception]. For instance, a\nperception of light or color of which we are aware is made up of many\nminute perceptions of which we are unaware; and a noise which we\nperceive but do not attend to is brought within reach of our awareness\nby a tiny increase or addition. (134) \nThus, at some level the noise will be noticed. Leibniz is silent on\nprecisely how this threshold is determined. Although he frequently\nclaims that differences in kind (although continuous with other kinds)\narise at the infinite or the infinitesimal, this is in tension with\nmany of the phenomena of consciousness which apparently arise at some\nmid-level degree of perceptual distinctness (as with the description\nof the difference between a conscious perception of light and an\nunconscious perception of light above). Here is another area where\nLeibniz is offering a theory and is optimistic that the\nrelevant natural factors determining the threshold will be discovered\nin the science of pneumatology (and, indeed, cognitive\nscience has made some progress in this direction).  \nBut the overall transition has been made. The initial transition from\na morally-laden concept to a fully psychological concept was made with\nDescartes and the Cambridge Platonists. And here, through the\nCartesians and in Leibniz, we see an attempt to clarify the concept\nand to provide a coherent analysis of the concept. Leibniz’s\naccount (and Spinoza’s account, insofar as he has one) treats\nconsciousness as a natural phenomenon to be explained in natural ways,\nand so he endeavors to explain consciousness in terms of the\nunderlying mental representations. This has obvious connections to\nrepresentational and functional accounts of consciousness that\ncontinue to this day. \n(For more on the topic of consciousness in Leibniz, see Barth 2011;\nBolton 2011; de Gaudemar 2004; Furth 1967; Jorgensen 2009, 2011a, and\n2011b; Kulstad 1990; Thiel 2011 (section 3 of chapter 9); and Simmons\n2001 and 2011.)","contact.mail":"ljorgens@skidmore.edu","contact.domain":"skidmore.edu"}]
