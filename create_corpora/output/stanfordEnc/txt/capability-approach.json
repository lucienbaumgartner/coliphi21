Capabilities are the doings and beings that people can\nachieve if they so choose, such as being well-nourished, getting\nmarried, being educated, and travelling; functionings are capabilities\nthat have been realized. Whether someone can convert a set of means -\nresources and public goods - into a functioning (i.e., whether she has\na particular capability) crucially depends on certain personal,\nsociopolitical, and environmental conditions, which, in the capability\nliterature, are called ‘conversion factors.’ Capabilities\nhave also been referred to as real or substantive freedoms as they\ndenote the freedoms that have been cleared of any potential obstacles,\nin contrast to mere formal rights and freedoms.\n\n\nWithin philosophy, the capability approach has been employed to the\ndevelopment of several conceptual and normative theories within, most\nprominently, development ethics, political philosophy, public health\nethics, environmental ethics and climate justice, and philosophy of\neducation. This proliferation of capability literature has led to\nquestions concerning what kind of framework it is (section 1); how its\ncore concepts should be defined (section 2); how it can be further\nspecified for particular purposes (section 3); what is needed to\ndevelop the capability approach into an account of social justice\n(section 4); how it relates to non-Western philosophies (section 5);\nand how it can be and has been applied in practice (section\n6). \n\nAlthough we can trace some aspects of the capability approach back to,\namong others, Aristotle, Adam Smith, and Karl Marx (see Nussbaum 1988,\n1992, 2020; Sen 1993a, 1999: 14, 24; Walsh 2000), it is\neconomist-philosopher Amartya Sen who pioneered the approach and\nphilosopher Martha Nussbaum and a growing number of other scholars\nacross the humanities and the social sciences who have significantly\ndeveloped it. The capability approach purports that freedom to achieve\nwell-being is a matter of what people are able to do and to be, and\nthus the kind of life they are effectively able to lead. \nThe capability approach has its origins in a number of articles in\nwhich Sen (1974; 1979a; 1979b) criticizes the limited informational\nbases of the traditional economic models and evaluative accounts\n(i.e., utilitarianism and resourcism). What is missing from these\ntraditional models, Sen argues, is a notion of what activities we are\nable to undertake (‘doings’) and the kinds of persons we\nare able to be (‘beings’). Sen calls this\nnotion capabilities. Capabilities are the real\nfreedoms that people have to achieve their potential doings and\nbeings. Real freedom in this sense means that one has all the required\nmeans necessary to achieve that doing or being if one wishes to. That\nis, it is not merely the formal freedom to do or be something, but the\nsubstantial opportunity to achieve it.  \nIn this way, the capability approach changes the focus from means (the\nresources people have and the public goods they can access) to ends\n(what they are able to do and be with those resources and goods).\nThis shift in focus is justified because resources and goods alone do\nnot ensure that people are able to convert them into actual doings and\nbeings. Two persons with similar sets of goods and resources may\nnevertheless be able to achieve very different ends depending on their\ncircumstances.  \nOne of the most prominent illustrations within the capability\nliterature of the need to move beyond a focus on goods and resources\nis found in Sen’s (1979a) “Equality of What?” Tanner\nlectures. Here, Sen asks us to consider two persons with the same set\nof resources. Yet, one person suffers from a disability. This\ndisability makes her unequal to the able-bodied person in two regards,\nwhich cannot be captured by a sole focus on resources. First of all,\nthe disabled person is unequal in terms of what she can do or be with\nher resources compared with the physically able person. She may, for\nexample, be confined to a wheelchair and thus restricted to places\nthat are wheelchair-accessible. Secondly, the disabled person may even\nbe doubly worse off because she only gets the same amount of resources\neven though she has more expenses in order to correct for her\ndisability. That is, because the disabled person needs to spend a\nconsiderable amount of her resources on a wheelchair merely to\nmove around, she has fewer resources available to pursue other\ngoals than the able-bodied person who can spend all her resources on\npursuing her valued ends. Thus, in order to evaluate people’s\nwell-being, we need to not only consider the amount of resources they\nhave, but also what they are able to do and be with those\nresources.    \nIn “Equality of What?” Sen also objects to utilitarian\nmeasures of well-being. According to a utilitarian measure,\nsomeone’s well-being should be evaluated in terms of the amount\nof utility, such as pleasure or happiness, that they derive from the\nresources and goods that they have. Consequently, a utilitarian may\nargue that the above example only shows that we ought to\ndistribute more resources, goods, and freedoms to\nthe disabled person to the extent that she experiences the same amount\nof well-being as the able-bodied person. As Sen (1979a) has shown,\nhowever, this response is inadequate. The disabled person may be a\npleasure wizard who gains a lot of utility from very little input.\nConversely, the able-bodied person may be very hard to please and thus\nrequires a large input of resources and freedoms in order to detect an\nincrease in well-being. In this case, Sen notes, the amended\nutilitarian position would actually direct more resources and freedoms\nto the able-bodied person and less to the disabled one. But surely it\ncannot be right to provide less help to those with greater needs,\nmerely because they are easier to satisfy. As Sen himself has\ndocumented, people living in deprivation may actually tend to lower\ntheir expectations as a coping mechanism (e.g., Kynch and Sen 1983).\nBut just because they experience a bigger increase in well-being from\nfewer resources, it does not mean that the situation is justified or\njustifiable in the first place.  \nPhilosophical accounts of well-being, freedom, and justice should thus\nrecognize the diversity of human needs and personal and contextual\ncircumstances. This is exactly what the notions of capabilities and\nfunctionings do. By focusing on what people are able to do and be,\nrather than merely on the distribution of goods and resources, the\ncapability approach recognizes the diversity of people’s ability\nto convert those resources and goods into real opportunities and\nachievements - the kind of life they are effectively able to lead. \nThe capability approach is generally conceived as a flexible and\nmulti-purpose framework, rather than a precise theory of well-being\n(Qizilbash 2008; Robeyns 2005, 94-96; Sen 1992; 2009). This open-ended\nand underspecified nature partly explains why the term\n‘capability approach’ was chosen and is now used in the\nphilosophical literature rather than, say, ‘capability\ntheory’. The terms ‘capability approach’ and\n‘capabilities approach’ are both used in the literature to\nrefer to the same thing, though the latter is often considered to\nrefer more specifically to Nussbaum’s partial theory of\njustice. Some philosophers have started to use the term\n‘capabilitarianism’ (Robeyns 2016; Nielsen and Axelsen\n2017). The proliferation of literature on the capability approach has\nengendered a discussion about how to exactly define and understand\nit. \nDespite some philosophical disagreements about the best description of\nthe capability approach, it is generally understood as a conceptual\nframework for a range of normative exercises, including most\nprominently the following: (1) the assessment of individual\nwell-being; (2) the evaluation and assessment of social arrangements;\nand (3) the design of policies and proposals about social change in\nsociety. In all these normative exercises, the capability approach\nprioritizes certain of peoples’ beings and doings and their\nopportunities to realize those beings and doings (such as their\ngenuine opportunities to be educated, their ability to move around or\nto enjoy supportive social relationships). This stands in contrast to\nother accounts of well-being, which focus exclusively on subjective\ncategories (such as happiness) or on the material means to well-being\n(such as resources like income or wealth). \nNussbaum (2011a) has described the general capability approach (not\nher own specific theory) as consisting of two clusters, one focussing\non comparative quality of life and the other on theorising about\njustice. The two clusters would share a focus on what people are able\ndoing and being, and would share a commitment to five principles:\ntreating each person as an end; a focus on choice and freedom rather\nthan achievements; pluralism about values; being deeply concerned with\nentrenched social injustices; and ascribing an urgent task to\ngovernment. However, it has been argued that only two of those\n(namely, treating each person as an end and pluralism about values)\nare genuinely essential to each and every capability theory, and that\nin addition there exists work in the capability approach that does not\nneatly fit into one of the two clusters that Nussbaum proposes\n(Robeyns 2016).  \nIn contrast to Nussbaum’s narrow understanding of the capability\napproach, Robeyns (2017) argues that we can and should distinguish\nbetween, on the one hand, the capability approach as an underspecified\nand open-ended framework and, on the other hand, the capability\napproach as more specific capability theories. The capability approach\nshould be defined as a normative framework, which can host a wide\nvariety of more specific theories and applications, such as, for\nexample, Nussbaum’s partial capability theory of justice,\nCrocker’s capability theory of deliberative democracy, and\ncapabilitarian econometrics. Likewise, Qizilbash (2012) argues that\nthe capability approach should be seen as a ‘thin’\nframework, which can be filled in by ‘thicker’ theories\nand applications. While all of these accounts may differ greatly in\ntheir specific structure, purpose, and normative commitments, they all\nadhere to the same normative core, namely a normative commitment to\nconceptualize well-being in terms of capabilities and\nfunctionings. \nThis core can then be supplemented through certain choices (see\nsections\n 2\n and\n 3),\n such as a particular purpose, methodological and meta-theoretical\ncommitments, and additional normative values to develop more\nparticular theories, such as a capability theory of justice or\ndemocracy, or applied to particular tasks, such as empirical studies\nor the conceptualization of education, health, and so\non.   \nConfusingly, within the literature the term ‘the capability\napproach’ has also often been used to refer not to this overall\nframework, but rather to a more specific capability theory, namely\nNussbaum’s (2000; 2011a) partial capability theory of justice,\nSen’s (2006; 2008; 2009) theory of transitional justice, or\nSen’s (1999) theory of development as freedom. Many capability\ntheorists have long believed that the capability approach has a\nnormative commitment to expand certain doings and beings that people\nhave reason to value, as Sen has proposed. However, it is possible to\ndevelop capability theories that differ significantly from\nNussbaum’s and Sen’s capability theories. For example,\nempirical applications of the capability framework do not necessarily\nhave to be committed to the political liberalism of Nussbaum’s\napproach or the expansion of valuable capabilities, while a theory of\neducational justice, such as the one developed by Walker and\nUnterhalter (2007), will differ quite drastically from a theory of\nhealth justice, like the ones developed by Venkatapuram (2011) or Prah\nRuger (2009; 2010). Moreover, the capability framework can and has\nbeen used for non-normative purposes, including the conceptualization\nof various phenomena, such as sharing of urban space, and the\nmeasurement of capabilities through both qualitative and quantitative\nresearch. These non-normative applications differ widely in their\nmethodological approaches and are not (necessarily) committed to the\nexpansion of capabilities. \nThe capability approach often provides one element in the\ndevelopment of an account of justice, social progress, development, or\nsomething else. For example, Crocker (2008) has extended the\ncapability approach with accounts of agency and participation into a\nmore detailed account of development ethics, but discusses at length\nthat not all versions of the capability approach are embracing agency\nso explicitly. Similarly, the capability approach can be developed\ninto an alternative evaluative tool that can replace traditional\nsocial cost-benefit analysis (Alkire 2002). Or it can be used as a\nnormative framework within which to evaluate and design policies and\nsocial institutions, ranging from welfare-state design in relatively\naffluent societies (Wolff and de-Shalit 2007), to governmental and\nnongovernmental development policies in poor countries, to policies\nthat affluent countries and international institutions employ (or are\nadvised to employ) in their efforts to aid poor countries, such as the\nUNDP’s Human Development Reports.  \nAt the core of the capability approach is a normative commitment to\nconceptualize well-being in terms of capabilities and\nfunctionings. Functionings are ‘doings and beings’,\nthat is, various states of human beings and activities that a person\ncan undertake, such as being well-nourished, getting married,\nbeing educated, and travelling, while capabilities are the real, or\nsubstantive, opportunity that they have to achieve these doings and\nbeings. (See\n section 2.2\n for a discussion of real/substantive freedom.) A person’s\n‘capability-set’ denotes the set of capabilities that he\nor she can choose from, while the term ‘basic\ncapabilities’ refers either to “the innate equipment of\nindividuals that is necessary for developing the more advanced\ncapabilities”, such as the capability of speech and language,\nwhich is present in a newborn but needs to be fostered (Nussbaum 2000,\n84), or to the freedom to do some basic things considered necessary\nfor survival and to avoid or escape poverty or other serious\ndeprivation (Sen 1992, 45, fn. 19). The relevance of basic\ncapabilities is “not so much in ranking living standards, but in\ndeciding on a cut-off point for the purpose of assessing poverty and\ndeprivation” (Sen 1987b, 109). \nRecently, there has been a discussion within the capability literature\nabout whether capabilities and functionings should be limited to\nonly encompass positively valued doings and beings — such\nas according to a normative theory, those that we have reason to\nvalue, or those which promote some ultimate normative aim, such as\nhuman dignity or agency — or whether capabilities and\nfunctionings are value-neutral concepts that encompass not only\nnormatively positive but also negative and neutral doings and beings\n(Byskov 2020; Robeyns 2017). \nWhy is the value-laden definition of capabilities problematic,\naccording to its critics? First, if what counts as a capability is -\nby definition - normatively valuable then it\nrisks ignoring that the value of a certain set of capabilities\nand functionings may also crucially depend on what it does\nnot allow one to do or be or if it allows one to realize\nmorally bad functionings, such as committing murder or polluting\n(Carter 2014; Dowding and Van Hees 2009). The value-laden conception\nof capabilities analytically excludes such non-normatively valued\ndoings and beings from consideration, even though they may be just as\nimportant for the valuation of a capability-set as positively valued\ndoings and beings. \nThe second reason why the value-laden definition might be problematic\nis because it excludes applications of the capability framework that\nare not concerned with what is valuable or not, and in some cases are\nconcerned with morally bad capabilities. Two such capability\napplications are the conceptualization of phenomena and empirical\npurposes. For example, an empirical study that investigates the\nprevalence of domestic violence in a society would be concerned with\nwhether husbands have capability (and functioning) of exercising such\nviolence - a clear-cut case of a morally bad, yet highly relevant,\ncapability. Thus, if the definition of capabilities and functionings\nis limited to only encompass normatively valuable or positive doings\nand beings, it excludes applications of the capability approach that\nare concerned with morally bad doings and beings and capability\napplications that are not concerned with whether capabilities are\nvaluable or not.   \nIn contrast to the value-laden definition, proponents of the\nvalue-neutral definition of capabilities and functionings hold that\ndoings and beings can be both positively and negatively valued as\nwell as normatively neutral. A capability, according to this\ndefinition, is simply the freedom that people have to do or be certain\nthings. Examples of capabilities that are usually evaluated positively\nare being well-nourished, sheltered, and educated, while examples of\ncapabilities that are usually negatively valued are the ability to\nkill (Stewart and Deneulin 2002, 67), the ability to rape, being\nvulnerable to natural hazards, and being able to pollute (Holland\n2008, 418; Nussbaum 2006, 166). Because both positively and negatively\nvalued capabilities determine how well-off we are, it is necessary\nthat capabilities are defined in a way that includes both. \nOther capabilities, meanwhile, are morally ambiguous or morally\nneutral. An example of a morally ambiguous capability is the\ncapability to care or provide care, which can at different times\neither be rewarding, for example for parents caring for a child, and a\nburden, especially for women who often face societal pressure to take\non the brunt of care activities. An example of a morally neutral\ncapability is the ability to choose between two equally effective and\nsustainable brands of washing liquid (Williams 1987). On the face of\nit, whether we can choose between different brands of washing liquid\nis of little relevance if our purpose is to conceptualize healthcare\nor if we are interested in measuring a rural community’s access\nto infrastructure. However, that is not to say that prima\nfacie irrelevant doings and beings cannot become relevant.\nIf, for example, one brand of washing liquid were shown to have a\npositive or negative effect on health, then it would be relevant for a\ncapabilitarian conceptualization of health to include the capability\nto choose between different brands of washing liquid. No doings and\nbeings are a priori irrelevant and, according to\nits proponents, only a value-neutral definition of capabilities can\naccommodate for this fact. \nLastly, it should be noted that it is only necessary to adopt the\nvalue-neutral definition at the level of the capability approach as a\ngeneral framework. Although the concept of\ncapabilities is value-neutral, for more particular purposes and\ntheories it will be useful and probably necessary to further specify\nby which criteria we make a selection of capabilities, according to\nthat purpose or theory, and whether it will only focus on valuable\ndoings and beings or also take bad capabilities into account (see\n section 3.2\n for a discussion of the selection of\ncapabilities).    \nIt has been mentioned above that capabilities are defined as the real,\nor substantive, freedoms that people have to achieve certain doings\nand beings. A frequent misunderstanding in the secondary\nliterature concerns the use of the term ‘freedom’.\nEspecially in his later work, Sen often equates capabilities with\nfreedoms, without always specifying in more detail what kind of\nfreedoms he is referring to. Yet this equation can easily be\nmisunderstood since, as Sen himself acknowledges, there are many kinds\nof freedom (some valuable, some detrimental, and some trivial) and\n‘freedom’ means very different things to different\npeople. \nOne important misunderstanding to get out of the way is that\ncapabilities as freedoms refer exclusively to the “free\nmarket.” Sen (1993b) does argue that people have reason to value\nthe freedom or liberty to produce, buy, and sell in markets. This\npoint, however, is part of his more general work on development, and\nis a very different matter than the highly disputed question in\neconomics and politics regarding the benefits and limits of the market\nas a system of economic production and distribution. Functionings and\ncapabilities are conceptualizations of well-being achievements and\nwell-being freedoms, and the question which economic institutions are\nthe best institutional means to foster functionings and capabilities\nis both analytically but also politically a question that can only be\nsettled after we first agree what economic outcomes we should be\naiming at—and this is a question to which the capability\napproach gives a (partial) answer. \nYet if Sen and other capability scholars label capabilities as\nfreedoms, then what kind of freedoms are capabilities? As Kaufman\n(2006a) has shown, understanding capability as an opportunity concept\nof freedom, rather than some other kind of freedom, may undermine\nmistaken critiques on Sen’s work. A careful reading of\nSen’s work clarifies that capabilities are freedoms conceived as\nreal opportunities (Sen 1985a, 3–4; 1985d, 201;\n2002, chapter 20).  \nReal freedom in this sense means that one has all the required means\nnecessary to achieve that doing and being if one wishes to. That is,\nit is not merely the formal freedom to do or be something, but the\nsubstantial opportunity to achieve it. Someone might, for example,\nhave the formal freedom to vote in elections in the sense that she has\nthe right to do so and that no one will stop her from doing so, but\nshe might lack the substantial possibility to vote because the closest\nvoting station is 200 kilometers away and she does not own a car and\ndoes not have access to other means of transportation. Conversely,\nsomeone may be living close to the voting station but still may not\nhave the real freedom to vote because females are not permitted to\nvote in that particular society or they risk bodily harm if exercising\ntheir formal voting rights. Capabilities are thus real freedoms in the\nsense that they are corrected for any potential\nimpediments. Functionings simply denotes those\ncapabilities that have been achieved whether voluntarily or by chance.\nFor example, someone might have the real freedom to vote but chooses\nnot to do so and thus does not have the functioning of voting. \nAnother question about freedom in the capability approach concerns\nwhether, or the extent to which, it corresponds to other concepts of\nfreedom within the philosophical literature, such as positive and\nnegative freedom. While more research is needed in this regard, some\nscholars have argued that the concept of freedom in the capability\napproach most resembles the concept of freedom as non-domination\nwithin republicanism, albeit with some notable caveats and\ndisagreement (Alexander 2010; List 2004; Pettit 2001; 2009; Sen 1983;\n2001).  \nWhether someone has the capability to achieve a certain doing or being\ndepends on so-called ‘conversion factors’ (Sen 1992,\n19-21, 26-30, 37-38). Resources, such as marketable goods and\nservices, but also goods and services emerging from the non-market\neconomy, including household production, have certain characteristics\nthat make them of interest to people. For example, we may be\ninterested in a bike not because it is an object made from certain\nmaterials with a specific shape and color, but because it can take us\nto places where we want to go, and in a faster way than if we were\nwalking. These characteristics of a good or commodity enable or\ncontribute to a functioning. A bike enables the functioning of\nmobility, to be able to move oneself freely and more rapidly than\nwalking. The relation between a good and the achievement of certain\nbeings and doings is captured with the term ‘conversion\nfactor’: the degree in which a person can transform a resource\ninto a functioning. For example, an able bodied person who was taught\nto ride a bicycle when he was a child has a high conversion factor\nenabling him to turn the bicycle into the ability to move around\nefficiently, whereas a person with a physical impairment or someone\nwho was never taught to ride a bike has a very low conversion factor.\nThe conversion factors thus represent how much functioning one can get\nout of a good or service; in our example, how much mobility the person\ncan get out of a bicycle. \nNote that on the most plausible reading of Sen (1985a), he is\nconcerned with the conversion of more tangible resources. There is no\nreason, however, that we should not be equally concerned with the\nconversion of more intangible resources, such as human capital and\npublic goods. In distinguishing between human capital and human\ncapabilities, for example, Sen (1997) seems to acknowledge that\nintangible resources (such as human capital) are merely means to\ncapabilities in the relevant sense. \nThere are several different types of conversion factors, and the\nconversion factors discussed are often categorized into three groups.\nAll conversion factors influence how a person can be or is free to\nconvert the characteristics of the resources into a functioning, yet\nthe sources of these factors may differ. Personal conversion\nfactors are internal to the person, such as metabolism, physical\ncondition, sex, reading skills, or intelligence. If a person is\ndisabled, is in bad physical condition, or has never learned to cycle,\nthen the bike will be of limited help in enabling the functioning of\nmobility. Social conversion factors are factors from the\nsociety in which one lives, such as public policies, social norms,\npractices that unfairly discriminate, societal hierarchies, or power\nrelations related to, for example, class, gender, race, or caste.\nEnvironmental conversion factors emerge from the physical or\nbuilt environment in which a person lives. Among aspects of\none’s geographical location are climate, pollution, the\nproneness to earthquakes, and the presence or absence of seas and\noceans. Among aspects of the built environment are the stability of\nbuildings, roads, and bridges, and the means of transportation and\ncommunication. Take the example of the bicycle. How much a bicycle\ncontributes to a person’s mobility depends on that\nperson’s physical condition (a personal conversion factor), the\nsocial mores including whether women are socially allowed to ride a\nbicycle (a social conversion factor), and the available of decent\nroads or bike paths (an environmental conversion factor). \nThe three types of conversion factors all stress that it is not\nsufficient to know the resources a person owns or can use in order to\nbe able to assess the well-being that he or she has achieved or could\nachieve; rather, we need to know much more about the person and the\ncircumstances in which he or she is living. Sen uses\n“capability” not to refer exclusively to a person’s\nabilities or other internal powers but to refer to an opportunity made\nfeasible, and constrained by, both internal (personal) and external\n(social and environmental) conversion factors. The real\nfreedom someone has to ride a bicycle is thus dependent on\nwhether these conditions are fulfilled and, in this sense, conversion\nfactors also shape the needs of the individuals in\nquestion: in a society in which the capability of riding a bicycle is\nimportant (e.g., in order to get to work), it becomes crucial to\nprovide decent roads and an adequate infrastructure (Crocker and\nRobeyns 2009, 68). \nLastly, whereas the capability approach usually focuses on the\nconversion of resources into individual capabilities and functionings,\nsome scholars have argued that this is too individualistic (Evans\n2002; Gore 1997; Stewart 2005). In fact, it is argued, many\ncapabilities can only be held or achieved through collective action.\nThis has resulted in the notion of ‘collective\ncapabilities’ (Ibrahim 2006; 2020). For example, the\ncapabilities for friendship, assembly, and political speech can only\nbe held or realized in collaboration with other individuals\n(Ibrahim 2020, 210). Likewise, Binder (2009; 2019) argues that\ncultural contexts influence individual agency goals and thus the\ncapabilities that we choose to pursue. In these ways, social\nrelations, collectives, and the larger social, cultural, and\ninstitutional context function as conversion factors for some\ncapabilities. Robeyns (2017, section 4.6), however, argues that the\ncollectivist critique conflates the capability approach’s\ncommitment to normative, or ethical, individualism (i.e., “that\nindividuals, and only individuals, are the units\nof ultimate moral concern”) with a commitment\nto methodological, or ontological, individualism — that\n“all social phenomena are to be explained wholly or exclusively\nin terms of their properties” (Bhargava 1992, 19). Although\nthe capability approach, according to Robeyns, is committed to the\nformer, it does not necessarily follow that collectives and social\nrelations have no bearing on how those capabilities are\nrealized.  \nAs the notion of conversion factors show, the capability approach\nexplicitly endorses and relies upon a key analytical distinction in\npractical philosophy, namely the means-ends distinction. The approach\nstresses that we should always be clear, when valuing something,\nwhether we value it as an end in itself, or as a means to a valuable\nend. For the capability approach, the ultimate ends of interpersonal\ncomparisons are people’s capabilities. This implies that the\ncapability approach evaluates policies and other changes according to\ntheir impact on people’s capabilities as well as their actual\nfunctionings. It asks whether people are able to be healthy, and\nwhether the means or resources necessary for this capability, such as\nclean water, adequate sanitation, access to doctors, protection from\ninfections and diseases, and basic knowledge on health issues, are\npresent. It asks whether people are well-nourished, and whether the\nmeans or conditions for the realization of this capability, such as\nhaving sufficient food supplies and food entitlements, are being met.\nIt asks whether people have access to a high-quality education system,\nto real political participation, and to community activities that\nsupport them, that enable them to cope with struggles in daily life,\nand that foster caring and warm friendships. \nMuch of the critique that capability theorists have advanced against\nalternative normative frameworks (such as Dworkinian resourcism, or\nthe Rawlsian social primary goods approach), can be traced back to the\nobjection that alternative approaches value particular means to\nwell-being rather than the ends. The main reason why the capability\napproach holds that it is better to focus on the ends rather than the\nmeans, is that people differ in their ability to convert means into\nvaluable opportunities (capabilities) or outcomes (functionings) (Sen\n1992: 26–28, 36–38). (See\n section 1.1.)\n Since ends are what ultimately matters when thinking about well-being\nand the quality of life, means can only work as reliable proxies of\npeople’s opportunities to achieve those ends if they all have\nthe same capacities or powers to convert those means into equal\ncapability sets. Capability scholars believe that these\ninter-individual differences are far-reaching and significant, and\nthat theories that focus on means tend to downplay their normative\nrelevance. In the theoretical framework of the capability approach,\nthese inter-individual differences are captured by the notion of\n‘conversion factors’ (see\n section 2.3). \nOne could argue, however, that the capability approach does not focus\nentirely on ends, but rather on the question whether a person is being\nput in the conditions in which she can pursue her ultimate ends. For\nexample, being able to read could be seen as not an ultimate end in\nitself, since people’s ultimate ends will be more specific, such\nas reading street signs, the newspaper, or the Bible or Koran. It is\ntherefore somewhat more precise to say that the capability approach\nfocuses on people’s ends in terms of beings and doings expressed\nin general terms: being literate, being mobile, being able to hold a\ndecent job. Whether a particular person then decides to translate\nthese general capabilities in the more specific capabilities\nA, B or C (e.g., reading street signs,\nreading the newspaper, or reading the Bible), is up to them. Whether\nthat person decides to stay put, travel to the US or rather to China,\nis not normatively relevant for the capability approach: the question\nis rather whether a person has these capabilities in more general\nterms. \nOf course, the normative focus on ends does not imply that the\ncapability approach does not at all value means such as material or\nfinancial resources. Instead, a capability analysis will typically\nalso focus on resources and other means, such as human capital (Sen\n1985a; 1997). For example, in their evaluation of development in\nIndia, Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen (2002: 3) have stressed that\nworking within the capability approach in no way excludes the\nintegration of an analysis of resources, such as food, or other\nresources. In sum, all the means of well-being, like the availability\nof commodities, legal entitlements to them, other social institutions,\nand so forth, are important, but the capability approach\npresses the point that they are not the ends of well-being, only their\nmeans. Food may be abundant in the village, but a starving person may\nhave nothing to exchange for it, no legal claim on it, or no way of\npreventing intestinal parasites from consuming it before he or she\ndoes. In all these cases at least some resources will be available,\nbut it will still leave that person hungry and, after a while,\nundernourished. \nYet one could wonder: would it not be better to focus on means\nonly, rather than making the normative analysis more complicated and\nmore informationally demanding by also focusing on functionings and\ncapabilities? Capability scholars would respond that starting a\nnormative analysis from the ends rather than means has at least two\nadvantages, apart from the earlier mentioned fundamental reason that a\nfocus on ends is needed to appropriately capture inter-individual\ndifferences. First, the valuation of means will retain the status of\nan instrumental valuation rather than take on the nature of an\nintrinsic valuation. For example, money or economic growth will not be\nvalued for their own sake, but only in so far as they contribute to an\nexpansion of people’s capabilities. Second, by starting from\nends, we do not a priori assume that there is only one overridingly\nimportant means to that ends (such as income), but rather explicitly\nask the question which types of means are important for the fostering\nand nurturing of a particular capability, or set of capabilities. For\nsome capabilities, the most important means will indeed be financial\nresources and economic production, but for others it may be particular\npolitical practices and institutions, such as effective guarantees and\nprotections of freedom of thought, political participation, social or\ncultural practices, social structures, social institutions, public\ngoods, social norms, and traditions and habits. As a consequence, an\neffective capability-enhancing policy may not exist in increasing\ndisposable income, but rather fighting a homophobic, ethnophobic,\nracist or sexist social climate. \nA strong acknowledgment of human diversity is one of the key\ntheoretical driving forces of the capability approach. Its criticism\nof other normative approaches is often fueled by, and based on, the\nclaim that the full human diversity among people is insufficiently\nacknowledged in many normative theories, such as theories of\ndistributive justice. This also explains why the capability approach\nis often favorably regarded by feminist philosophers, or philosophers\nconcerned with care and disability issues (e.g. Khader 2008, Terzi\n2008, 2010), since one of their main complaints about mainstream moral\nand political philosophy has precisely been the relative invisibility\nof the fate of those people whose lives did not correspond to that of\nan able-bodied, non-dependent, caregiving-free individual who belongs\nto the dominant ethnic, racial and religious group. People of color,\nmarginalized people, the disabled and many women do not fit that\npicture. \nThe capability approach thus takes account of human diversity in at\nleast three ways. First, by its focus on the plurality of functionings\nand capabilities as important evaluative spaces. By including a wide\nrange of dimensions in the conceptualization of well-being and\nwell-being outcomes, the approach broadens the so-called\n‘informational basis’ of assessments, and thereby includes\nsome dimensions that may be particularly important for some groups but\nless so for others. For example, in standard outcome assessments,\nwomen as a group virtually always end up being worse off than men. But\nif the selection of outcome dimensions is shifted to also include the\nquality and quantity of social relations and support, and being able\nto engage in hands-on care, then the normative assessment of gender\ninequality becomes less univocal and requires much further argument\nand normative defense, including being explicit about how to aggregate\ndifferent dimensions (Robeyns 2003). \nSecondly, human diversity is stressed in the capability approach by\nthe explicit focus on personal and socio-environmental conversion\nfactors that make possible the conversion of commodities and other\nresources into functionings, and on the social, institutional, and\nenvironmental context that affects the conversion factors and the\ncapability set directly. Each individual has a unique profile of\nconversion factors, some of which are body-related, others of which\nare shared with all people from her community, and still others of\nwhich are shared with people with the same social characteristics\n(e.g., same gender or class or race characteristics). \nThird, human diversity within the capability approach is captured by\nan acknowledgement of human agency and the diversity of goals people\nhave in life. Sen distinguishes between two kinds of freedom, namely\nwhat he calls well-being\nfreedom and agency freedom (Sen 1985d).\nBoth of these can also be analyzed in terms of whether they have been\nachieved. In that case they are called well-being\nachievement and agency achievement. Well-being\nfreedoms are those freedoms that promote our well-being\ngenerally. Being well-nourished, for example, is part of our\nwell-being. But we may also value freedoms that do not promote our\nwell-being, such as giving up a promising career in order to fight for\nglobal justice. My fighting global justice may not provide me with\nanything in terms of well-being as it requires me to travel to some of\nthe most insecure places on earth and does not provide a steady\nincome. I am worse off in terms of well-being compared to the\nalternative of pursuing a promising career. Yet, I value this freedom\nbecause it is an expression of my agency. The recognition of agency\nfreedom, in addition to well-being freedom, allows people to pursue a\ndiversity of doings and beings.  \nAccording to the capability approach, ‘functionings’ and\n‘capabilities’ are the best metric for most kinds of\ninterpersonal evaluations. In other words, those interpersonal\nevaluations should be conceptualized in terms of people’s\nfunctioning and their capabilities. These beings and doings together\nare held to constitute what makes a life valuable. Whereas\n‘functionings’ are the proposed conceptualization for\ninterpersonal comparisons of (achieved) well-being,\n‘capabilities’ are the conceptualization for interpersonal\ncomparisons of the freedom to pursue well-being, which Sen calls\n“well-being freedom” (Sen 1992: 40). \nThe relevant functionings can vary from such elementary things as\nbeing adequately nourished, being in good health, avoiding escapable\nmorbidity and premature mortality, to more complex achievements such\nas having a decent and valuable job, not suffering from lack of\nself-respect, taking active part in the life of the community, and so\non. The claim is that functionings are constitutive of a\nperson’s being, and an evaluation of well-being has to take the\nform of an assessment of these constituent elements (Sen 1992: 39). To\nsay that functionings are constitutive of a person’s being means\nthat one cannot be a human being without having at least a range of\nfunctionings: they make the lives of human beings both lives\n(in contrast to the existence of innate objects) and also\nhuman (in contrast to the lives of trees or tigers). Human\nfunctionings are those beings and doings that we take to constitute a\nhuman life, and which are central in our understandings of ourselves\nas human beings. This implies that the range of potentially relevant\nfunctionings is very broad, and that the capability approach will in\nsome respects be close to both subjective metrics (for example, by\nincluding the capability to be happy), or resources-based metrics\n(since most functionings require some resources as inputs). Yet not\nall beings and doings are functionings; for example, being able to fly\nlike a bird or reaching an age of 200 like an oak tree, are not human\nfunctionings. \nThus, according to the capability approach, the ends of well-being\nfreedom, justice, and development should be conceptualized in terms of\npeople’s capabilities. Moreover, what is relevant is not only\nwhich opportunities are open to me each by themselves, hence in a\npiecemeal way, but rather which combinations or sets of potential\nfunctionings are open to me. For example, suppose I am a low-skilled\npoor single parent who lives in a society without decent social\nprovisions. Take the following functionings: (1) to hold a job, which\nwill require me to spend many hours on working and commuting, but will\ngenerate the income needed to properly feed myself and my family; (2)\nto care for my children at home and give them all the attention, care\nand supervision they need. In a piecemeal analysis, both (1) and (2)\nare opportunities open to me, but they are not both together\nopen to me. The point about the capability approach is precisely that\nwe must take a comprehensive or holistic approach, and ask which\nsets of capabilities are open to me, that is: can I\nsimultaneously provide for my family and properly care for and\nsupervise my children? Or am I rather forced to make some hard,\nperhaps even tragic choices between two functionings which both\nreflect basic needs and basic moral duties? \nNote that while most types of capability analysis require\ninterpersonal comparisons, one could also use the capability approach\nto evaluate the well-being or well-being freedom of one person at one\npoint in time (e.g., evaluate her situation against a\ncapability-yardstick), or to evaluate the changes in her well-being or\nwell-being freedom over time. The capability approach could thus also\nbe used by a single individual in her deliberate decision-making or\nevaluation processes, but these types of uses of the capability\napproach are much less prevalent in the philosophical literature, let\nalone in the social sciences. \nBuilding on its core of central concepts and normative commitments,\nthe capability approach can be developed into more specific capability\ntheories. As Robeyns (2017, chapter 1) argues, some specifications are\nnecessary to make, such as what the purpose of the theory is, what\ncapabilities or functionings are normatively relevant, and whether to\nfocus on capabilities or functionings. Other specifications are\noptional in the sense that whether we need them depends on the\nparticular capability theory we are developing, including how to weigh\ndifferent capabilities against each other and what other normative\nconcerns that the theory should take into consideration. In this\nsection, we explain some of the choices that need to or can be made\nwhen developing a capability theory. \nThe capability approach can be applied to many different purposes and\nthe choice of purpose, or application, of the theory matters for other\nspecifications that are made. \nSome purposes introduce additional normative, descriptive, and/or\nmeta-theoretical commitments. For example, a capability theory of\nenvironmental justice that is grounded in the Western philosophical\ntradition might struggle to account for the protection of non-human\nentities, such as animals, forests, and rivers, in ways that a\ncommitment to non-Western and holistic ontologies might not (Watene\n2016). \nThe choice of purpose also influences the selection of relevant\ncapabilities and functionings and how this selection should be done.\nFor example, applying the capability approach to developing an account\nof health justice invariably entails a focus on those capabilities and\nfunctionings that are relevant for health (Prah Ruger 2009;\nVenkatapuram 2011). \nLastly, the choice of purpose affects whether one needs to make some\nof the optional specifications. For example, capabilitarian accounts\nof policy-making should explain how the different capability-sets that\ndifferent policy choices yield can be compared and traded off against\neach other. \nScholars interested in the capability approach have debated the\nquestion of whether the appropriate well-being metric should be\ncapabilities or functionings, hence opportunities or achievements.\nWhat considerations have been argued to be relevant for this\nchoice? \nThe first consideration is normative, and this is the argument Sen and\nNussbaum most often offer: by focusing on capabilities rather than\nfunctionings, we do not privilege a particular account of good lives\nbut instead aim at a range of possible ways of life from which each\nperson can choose. Thus, it is Nussbaum’s and Sen’s\ncommitment to a liberal version of the capability approach, or an\nanti-paternalist consideration, that motivates a principled choice for\ncapabilities rather than functionings. Obviously, the strength of this\nargument depends on how bad one takes paternalism to be. There may be\ngood reasons to believe that some paternalism is unavoidable, or even\ndesired (Nussbaum 2000, 51–56). To some extent, the\npromotion of functionings (rather than capabilities) may be\nunavoidable in a capabilitarian political theory, yet this tendency to\npaternalism can be stronger or weaker, depending on several specific\nchoices made in the theory (Claassen 2014). \nA second normative consideration stems from the importance given to\npersonal responsibility in contemporary political philosophy. If one\nbelieves that one should strive for equality of capability, then each\nperson should have the same real opportunity (capability), but once\nthat is in place, each individual should be held responsible for his\nor her own choices. This responsibility-sensitivity principle is\nwidely endorsed not only in political philosophy but also in the\nmathematical models being developed in normative welfare economics. If\none wants to endorse and implement this principle of\nresponsibility-sensitivity, then specifications and applications of\nthe capability approach should focus on capabilities, rather than\nfunctionings. Yet even at a highly abstract theoretical level,\nphilosophers disagree on whether we should endorse\nresponsibility-sensitivity in developing the capability approach\n(e.g., Fleurbaey 2002; Vallentyne 2005; Wolff and de-Shalit 2007).\nMoreover, for applied work, serious epistemological hurdles may\nultimately lead us to drop the responsibility-sensitive principle for\npractical reasoning about the actual world. \nThird, there are cases in which a capability is available to a person\nbut only if other people do not also want to realize that capability\n(Basu 1987: 74). For example, two spouses may each have the capability\nof holding demanding jobs which are each on their own incompatible\nwith large caring responsibilities. However, if these spouses also\nhave infants or relatives with extensive care needs, then at best only\none of them may effectively realize that capability. Since capability\nsets may therefore include freedoms that are conditional (because they\ndepend on the choices of other people), it might be better to focus\nboth on the individual’s capability set and also on what people\nhave been able to realize from their own capability sets, that is,\ntheir functionings or well-being achievements. The question of who\ndecides or should decide this sort of spousal question\nhighlights the importance of agency and procedural fairness, which are\ngenerally taken to be part of the capability approach in its broader\nuse (Crocker 2008). \nIt should also be mentioned that the concept of functioning has\nparticular relevance for our relations to those human beings who are\nnot yet able to choose (infants), who will never be able to make some\nparticular choices (severely mentally disabled individuals), or who\nhave lost this ability through advanced dementia or serious brain\ndamage. Whether or not these persons can decide to be well nourished\nand healthy, it is generally held that we (through families,\ngovernments, or other institutions) have the moral obligation to\npromote or protect their nutritional and healthy functioning. \nFinally, the choice between functionings and capabilities can also be\nbridged by a conceptual move. Sen (1987b: 36–7) has proposed the\nconcept of ‘refined functioning’ to designate functioning\nthat takes note of the available alternatives. Sen (1992: 52) notes:\n“‘fasting’ as a functioning is not just starving; it\nis choosing to starve when one does have other\noptions.” That is, one could focus on achieved functionings\nlevels but—where appropriate—include the exercise of\nchoice as one of the relevant functionings (Fleurbaey 2002; Stewart\n1995). \nIn addition to these normative and conceptual arguments, there are\nalso concerns related to the application and measurability that\ninfluence the choice of capabilities, functionings, or a combination\nof the two (Robeyns 2006). It is, for example, almost always easier to\nobserve and measure functionings than capabilities (Sen 1992:\n52–3). \nOther major points of debate in the capability literature are the\nquestions of which capabilities should be selected as relevant and who\nshould decide (or how a decision should be made) on the aggregation of\nthe various dimensions into an overall assessment (Claassen 2020). At\nthe level of ideal theories of justice, some have argued that each and\nevery capability is relevant and should count in our moral calculus\n(Carter 2014; Vallentyne 2005). Others have argued that considerations\nof justice require that we demarcate morally relevant from morally\nirrelevant and morally bad capabilities (Nussbaum 2003; Pogge 2002).\nThis demarcation could be done in various ways, and most capability\nscholars think that different answers are appropriate in different\nnormative exercises. In other words, the selection of relevant\ncapabilities would be different when the question is how to arrange a\nsociety’s basic structure, versus when the question is how to\nspend the donations Oxfam has collected, or when the normative\nquestion is how to raise one’s child. Anderson (1999) argues\nthat, for purposes of political justice, the only relevant\ncapabilities are those needed for a person to participate as a\ncitizen. Nussbaum endorses a well-defined list of capabilities, which,\nshe argues, should be enshrined in every country’s constitution\n(Nussbaum 2000, 2003, 2006). Sen has been somewhat vague in responding\nto the question of how to select and weight capabilities, yet in the\nsecondary literature it has been argued that he draws on his ideal of\nagency to argue that each group should itself select, weight, trade\noff, and sequence or otherwise aggregate capabilities as well as\nprioritize them in relation to other normative considerations, such as\nagency, efficiency, and stability (Crocker 2008). \nMoving from ideal theory to non-ideal theory and empirical\napplications makes the selection of relevant capabilities even more\ncomplicated, for other concerns such as feasibility, data\navailability, practical relevance, and even parsimony may play\nsignificant roles. Several proposals are on offer, ranging from\nsubstantive proposals with elaborate theoretical underpinnings,\nthrough several procedural methods, to the atheoretical\npractice that an investigator should simply conduct a survey in order\nto collect rich data (or use an existing survey) and let a statistical\ntechnique, such as factor analysis, “decide.” At one end\nof this spectrum is Nussbaum’s well-known list, which contains\nprescribed capabilities that are grouped together under ten\n“central human capabilities”: life; bodily health; bodily\nintegrity; senses, imagination and thought; emotions; practical\nreason; affiliation; other species; play; and control over one’s\nenvironment (Nussbaum 2006: 76–78). \nNussbaum (2000: 70–77; 2006: 78–81) justifies this list by\narguing that each of these capabilities is needed in order for a human\nlife to be “not so impoverished that it is not worthy of the\ndignity of a human being” (2000: 72). She defends these\ncapabilities as being the moral entitlements of every human being on\nearth. She formulates the list at an abstract level and advocates that\nthe translation to implementation and policies should be done at a\nlocal level, taking into account local differences. Nussbaum argues\nthat this list can be derived from a Rawlsian overlapping consensus\nand stresses that her list remains open-ended and always open for\nrevision (Nussbaum 2000: 77), yet other philosophers have taken issue\nwith her claim that this would result in a form of political\nliberalism (Barclay 2003) or have argued that this leaves insufficient\nscope for democratic deliberation and respect for agency in her\ncapability approach (e.g., Crocker 2008; Robeyns 2003; Sen 2004a,\n2004b). Yet this strand of critique has itself been criticized for not\nunderstanding the proper role of philosophy and the normative and\npolitical status of Nussbaum’s proposal (Claassen 2011). \nSen consistently and explicitly refuses to defend “one\npre-determined canonical list of capabilities, chosen by theorists\nwithout any general social discussion or public reasoning” (Sen\n2005: 158). Of course, groups and theorists might construct lists for\nvarious purposes, and lists need not be “pre-determined”\nor “canonical,” however we might understand these terms.\nAnd Sen’s refusal to endorse Nussbaum’s list has not\nprevented him from using—for various purposes—particular\nselections of capabilities in his empirical as well as his normative\nwork. However, beyond stating in general terms that some democratic\nprocess and public reasoning should be involved, Sen has never\nexplained in detail how such a selection could and should be done. Sen\n(2005) has been reluctant to specify a substantive list of\ncapabilities and functionings in order to avoid paternalism - holding\nthat communities should decide for themselves, which capabilities\nshould apply - and the imposition of a particular conception of the\ngood life. Consequently, Sen (1987b; 1992; 2002; 2009) has repeatedly\nstated that capabilities should be defined as the real freedom to\nachieve those doings and beings that we ‘have reason to\nvalue’. The ‘having reason to value’-formulation of\ncapabilities and functionings is widely regarded within the capability\nliterature as the correct, only, or most popular definition. \nOn the one hand, the ‘having reason to value’ definition\nhighlights the importance of taking into account what people\nthemselves value doing and being when evaluating their well-being.\nThis is contrary to more objective measures of well-being, such as\nutilitarianism or resourcism, which hold that people’s\nwell-being can and should be evaluated according to some objective\nmeasure, such as the amount of resources that they have or the amount\nof utility they derive from having these resources. On the other hand,\nSen’s definition also breaks with more subjective approaches to\nwell-being and the idea that people’s subjective evaluation of\ntheir well-being is all that matters. In response, Sen (1985a; 1985c;\n1987a) argues that people may be mistaken about their own well-being.\nFor example, someone might be destitute, yet evaluate their own\nsubjective well-being quite highly or value certain things, such as\nsmoking, that are actually bad for her. In order to avoid such\ncounter-intuitive conclusions, Sen invokes the notion of\nreasonableness as an objective criterion. We need to submit our values\nto a process of scrutiny and (public) reasoning and only those valued\ncapabilities that can survive this procedure can be said to be\nreasonable.  \nHowever, it has often been a matter of interpretation and contention\nwithin the capability literature what Sen means exactly with\n‘having reason to value.’ Khader and Kosko (2019) argue\nthat there are three interpretations of Sen’s ‘having\nreason to value’ definition. On the procedural autonomy\ninterpretation, an individual Y has reason to value doing or\nbeing X if Y has reasoned that X is valuable; on the process\ninterpretation, what we have reason to value is not necessarily\nwhat we do value, but rather what we\nwould value if we had gone through the proper process of\nindividual reflection (Alkire and Deneulin 2009; Bonvin and Farvaque\n2005, 282; Ibrahim and Alkire 2007; Nussbaum 2000; Sen 2002, 16) or\npublic deliberation (Alkire 2013, 91; Sen 1999, 152–153; Crocker\n2008, 270); and on the perfectionist interpretation,\nwhat people have reason to value is what is objectively valuable: Y\nsimply has reason to value X because X is valuable, even if Y does not\nherself value X (e.g., Arneson 2020). \nThe disagreement between Nussbaum and Sen on how to select\nrelevant capabilities has led many capability scholars to conclude\nthat there are only two strands of selecting capabilities, namely the\nphilosophical approach favored by Nussbaum or the procedural approach\nadvanced by Sen. However, as Byskov (2018a; 2018b, chapter 6) argues,\nthis is too simple and ignores many possible and already used methods\nfor the selection of capabilities and functionings. Byskov identifies\nat least 14 different methods for the selection of capabilities within\nthe literature, which he categorizes into ad\nhoc methods, which base their selection of capabilities on\npragmatic considerations; foundational methods, which\nselect capabilities according to some ultimate normative value or\nprinciple; procedural methods, which employ open-ended\nempirical or deliberative exercises to determine relevant\ncapabilities; and mixed (or multi-stage) methods, which\ncombine two or more foundational and/or procedural methods. \nThe theoretical debate on the selection of dimensions has been\ncomplicated by the fact that there are different views on the status\nof the selection. Is that selection a truth-claim, or should it rather\nbe seen as a contribution to democratic-decision making? Is the\nscholar proposing a selection of capabilities akin to a\nphilosopher-king, or rather to a philosopher-citizen or a\nphilosopher-mediator? Depending on how one sees these issues, it may\naffect how justified one believes a certain selection or selection\nprocedure to be (Claassen 2011, Byskov 2017). \nWhat about weighting different capabilities to come to an aggregate\nevaluation? If we have a list of relevant capabilities, we would still\nbe left with the question of whether the capabilities should be\naggregated and, if so, what their relative weights and the formula to\naggregate them will or should be. A closely related question is how\ndifferent capabilities should be traded off against one another when\nthey cannot all be realized fully. Some have argued against trade-offs\non the basis that the different capabilities are incommensurable or\nthat each capability is an absolute entitlement that never should be\noverridden by another entitlement or other normative consideration.\nFor example, Nussbaum argues that the ten capabilities on her list,\nbeing incommensurable, cannot be traded off against one another (and,\nhence, have no relative weights), and also that the state should\nprovide each citizen with a minimum threshold of each capability. \nOne possible system of weighting or aggregating is to use a democratic\nor some other social choice procedure (Chakraborty 1996). The basic\nidea would be to encourage or prescribe that the relevant group of\npeople decide on the weights. In some contexts, such as small-scale\nprojects or evaluations, such capability weighting (and selection)\ncould be done by participatory techniques. It has also been suggested\nthat we may determine the weights of capabilities as a function of how\nmuch they contribute to overall life satisfaction or happiness\n(Schokkaert 2007). Yet this raises the question to what extent\nfunctionings are taken to be merely instrumental to another end, such\nas happiness, or indeed any other ultimate good or ideal. \nMuch of the existing literature refers to the issue of\n‘weighting’, but this is only one particular form of the\nmore general ‘aggregating’, since aggregation may take a\ndifferent functional form than simply adding up. For example, if you\nhave no food, your other capabilities will be worth very little. Some\ncapabilities may thus be complementary capabilities, implying that\ntheir value to a person depends on the presence (or absence) of other\ncapabilities. (Note the similarity with the notion of\n‘complementary goods’ in consumer theory in economics,\nwhere it is argued that the utility of some goods is dependent on the\nquantity of some other goods, as in the case of pencils and erasers,\nor shoe polish and shoes of the same color). \nWhen developing a capability theory it is often necessary to specify\nwhat additional descriptive, normative, metaphysical, and/or\nmeta-theoretical commitments are made. As mentioned, the purpose of\none’s theory might determine some of the commitments that the\ntheory must adhere to, however in other cases this is not necessarily\nso. For example, while a capability theory of distributive justice -\nmore on which in\n section 4\n - is committed to conceptualizing justice primarily in terms of\nthe fair distribution of capabilities and functionings, it is an open\nquestion whether the distribution of other normative concerns, such as\nutility, happiness, or resources, should play a secondary role.\nLikewise, the choice of distributive principle is also open and one\nmay develop sufficientarian, strict egalitarian, or prioritarian\ntheories of justice, all of which are committed to the distribution of\ncapabilities and functionings, while the notion of responsibility that\nis employed may rely on different descriptive theories of human beings\nas either fully or only partially rational beings. A capability theory\nof justice may also include metaphysical commitments that extend\nrights and responsibilities to non-human animals and entities. \nThe capability approach is often wrongly taken to be an egalitarian\ntheory or a theory of social or distributive justice. This reading is\nmistaken, even though it is entirely understandable given the specific\ndebates in which the main philosophers defending the capability\napproach made their interventions. The capability approach specifies\nwhat should count for interpersonal evaluations and thus provides an\nimportant aspect of a theory of social or distributive justice, yet\nmore is needed. \nNussbaum’s work comes closest to offering us a capability theory\nof justice, but her theory too does not amount to a full theory\nof social justice. Nussbaum’s theory of social justice is\ncomprehensive, in the sense that it is not limited to an account of\npolitical justice, or to liberal democracies. Rather, her account\nholds for all human beings on earth, independently of whether they are\nliving in a liberal democratic regime, or of whether they are severely\ndisabled. The main demarcation of Nussbaum’s account is that it\nprovides only “a partial and minimal account of social\njustice” (Nussbaum 2006: 71) by specifying thresholds of a list\nof capabilities that governments in all nations should guarantee to\ntheir citizens. Nussbaum’s theory focuses on thresholds, but\nthis does not imply that reaching these thresholds is all that matters\nfor social justice; rather, her theory is partial and simply leaves\nunaddressed the question what social justice requires once those\nthresholds are met. \nNote, however, that not all capability theorists working on issues of\njustice believe that aiming for such a fully worked-out theory of\njustice is what thinking about justice requires. Sen (2006; 2008;\n2009) himself has argued at length that we don’t need a theory\nthat describes a utopian ideal, but rather we need theorising to help\nus with making comparisons of injustice, and to guide us towards a\nless unjust society. Similarly, Drydyk (2012) has argued that the\ncapability approach to justice should focus on reducing capability\nshortfalls, for which a utopian account of perfect justice is not\nneeded. Some capability theorists may want to work out a full theory\nof justice by addressing the various specifications outlined above,\nwhile others may want to change the nature of theorising about\njustice, moving it more to applied, non-ideal or grounded theories\n(Watene and Drydyk 2016). \nMoreover, it would be a mistake to think that there can be only one\ncapability theory of justice; on the contrary, the open nature of the\ncapability approach allows for the development of a family of\ncapability theories of justice, including accounts proposed by\nAnderson (1999) and Claassen (2018). But this prompts the\nquestion: what is needed to develop a full capability theory of\njustice, and which of these aspects have already been developed by\ntheorists of justice? \nFirst, a theory of justice needs to explain on what basis it justifies\nits principles or claims of justice. For example, while the early\nNussbaum (1992) justifies her list of capabilities through an analysis\nof what can be considered essential human traits, the later Nussbaum\n(2011a) holds that her list of capabilities is justified because they\npromote human dignity. Anderson (1999, 316) argues that people should\nbe entitled “to whatever capabilities are necessary to enable\nthem to avoid or escape entanglement in oppressive social\nrelationships” and “to the capabilities necessary for\nfunctioning as an equal citizen in a democratic state.” Claassen\n(2017, 2018) argues that the capabilities relevant for social justice\ncan be derived from society’s ultimate concern with navigational\nagency. \nSecond, as indicated above, in developing a capability theory of\njustice we must decide whether we want it to be an outcome or an\nopportunity theory, that is, whether we think that we should assess\ninjustices in terms of functionings, or rather in terms of\ncapabilities, or a mixture. At the level of theory and principles,\nmost theorists of justice endorse the view that justice is done if all\nhave equal genuine opportunities, or if all reach a minimal threshold\nof capability levels. Translated to the capability language, this\nwould imply that at the level of theory and principles, capabilities\nare the relevant metric of justice, and not functionings. However, not\neveryone subscribes to this view. Phillips (2004) has been a prominent\nvoice arguing for equality of outcome, rather than opportunities. In\nthe capability literature, Fleurbaey (2002) has argued against the\nview to take only capabilities into account and has defended a focus\non ‘refined functionings’ (being the combination of\nfunctionings and capabilities). \nThird, a capability theory of justice will need, just as all other\ntheories that are derived from the general and underspecified\ncapability approach, to address the issue of selecting, quantifying\nand aggregating of dimensions. For the case of theories of justice,\nthe problem of selecting, quantifying and aggregating turns into the\nquestion: ‘in which dimensions should we evaluate justice, how\nshould we construct metrics in these dimensions, and how should we\naggregate all the dimensions for overall assessments of\njustice?’ The general challenge of selecting and aggregating\nwhich was discussed above therefore also applies here. \nFourth, a capability theory of justice may need to address other\n‘metrics of justice’. Within theories of justice, one\nstrand of debate has been between those defending capabilities and\nfunctionings, on the one hand, and those defending Dworkian resources\n(see Dworkin 2000, 299–303; Kaufman 2006b, 125–128; Pierik\nand Robeyns 2007; Sen 1985b; 2009, 264–268; Williams 2002).\nFunctionings and capabilities have also been proposed by capability\nphilosophers as an alternative for, and improvement on, the Rawlsian\nsocial primary goods metric, which focuses on general purpose goods,\nsuch as income and wealth, opportunities and liberties, and the social\nbasis of self-respect (Rawls 1971). Sen argues that a focus on primary\ngoods is inherently inflexible as a metric of justice: “the\nprimary goods approach seems to take little note of the diversity of\nhuman beings. … If people were basically very similar, then an\nindex of primary goods might be quite a good way of judging advantage.\nBut, in fact, people seem to have very different needs varying with\nhealth, longevity, climatic conditions, location, work conditions,\ntemperament, and even body size. … So what is being involved is\nnot merely ignoring a few hard cases, but overlooking very widespread\nand real differences” (Sen 1979a: 215–216), such as in the\ncase of the disabled person who would not have a claim to additional\nresources grounded in his impairment under Rawls’s two\nprinciples of justice. Sen argues that Rawls’s difference\nprinciple would not justify any redistribution to the disabled on\ngrounds of disability. \nYet while capability scholars initially seemed rather sure of their\ncase against Rawls (Sen 1979a, Nussbaum 2006), a more recent wave of\nphilosophical enquiry has highlighted how complicated the comparisons\nbetween Rawls’s theory of justice and the capability view are\n(Pogge 2002, Robeyns 2009, Brighouse and Robeyns 2010). One\nreason is that the capability metric is a general metric of well-being\nand well-being freedom, whereas the social primary goods metric\nemerges as one element of an integral and complex theory of political\njustice (rather than social justice more broadly, let alone the even\nwider category of moral evaluations). As Arneson (2010) rightly notes,\nthe unit of assessment ideally should be the moral theory, and not\nmerely one part of it, such as the metric of interpersonal comparison.\nAlso, Rawls’s theory of justice is an ideal theory of\njustice, in contrast to the capability approach. This means that it is\nvery hard to compare Rawls’s work on justice with the\nphilosophical work on the capability approach, since their scope and\ntheoretical aims are not the same. Moreover, Rawlsians have criticized\nthe capability approach too, and not all of their critiques have been\nsufficiently rebutted (Freeman 2006; Kelly 2010; Pogge 2002,\nRichardson 2006). \nFifth, a capability theory of justice needs to take a position on the\n‘distributive rule’ (Anderson 2010: 81) that it will\nendorse: will it argue for plain equality, or for sufficiency, or for\nprioritarianism, or for some other (mixed) distributive rule? Both\nNussbaum’s (2006) and Andersons’s (1999; 2010) theories\nare sufficiency accounts, but from this it does not follow, as\none sometimes reads in the secondary literature, that the capability\napproach entails a sufficiency rule. Sen may have given the (wrong)\nimpression of defending straight equality as a distributive rule, by\nasking the question ‘Equality of what?’ (Sen 1979a),\nthough a careful reading shows that he was merely asking the question\n‘If we want to be defending equality of something, then\nwhat would that be?’ In fact, Sen has remained uncommitted to\none single distributive rule, which probably can be explained by the\nfact that he is averse of building a well-defined theory of justice\nbut rather prefers to investigate how real-life unjust situations can\nbe turned into more just situations, even if perfect justice is\nunattainable (Sen 2009). The capability approach clearly plays a role\nin Sen’s work on justice, since when assessing a situation he\nwill investigate inequalities in people’s capabilities and\nanalyze the processes that led to those inequalities.  \nSixth, a capability theory of justice needs to specify where the line\nbetween individual and collective responsibility is drawn, or how it\nwill be decided, and by whom, where this line will be drawn. There is\na remarkable absence of any discussion about issues of responsibility\nin the capability literature. In part this might be explained by the\nfact that much of the work on capabilities deals with global poverty,\nwhere issues of individual responsibility seem to be less relevant\nsince it would seem outrageous to suggest that the world’s most\ndestitute people are personally responsible for the situation they are\nin. That doesn’t mean that the responsibility question is not\nimportant: it is indeed of utmost importance to ask who is responsible\nfor global poverty reduction or the fulfilling of the Millenium\nDevelopment Goals, on which political philosophers have written a\ngreat deal (e.g., Pogge 2008, Singer 2009). The point is rather that\nphilosophical puzzles, such as the issues of expensive tastes (for\nexpensive wine, caviar, fast cars, or you name it), are simply beyond\nthe radar screen of the child laborer or the poor peasant. \nThis brings us to a related issue: a theory of justice generally\nspecifies not only rights, but also duties. However, capability\ntheorists have remained largely silent on the questions of who should\nbear the duties for the expansion of the selected capabilities.\nNussbaum passionately advocates that all people all over the world\nshould be entitled, as a matter of justice, to threshold levels of all\nthe capabilities on her list; but apart from mentioning that it is the\ngovernments’ duties to guarantee these entitlements (2006: 70),\nshe remains silent on the question who precisely should bear the\nburdens and responsibilities for realizing these capabilities. Yet as\nOnora O’Neill (1996: chapter 5) has argued, questions of\nobligations and responsibilities should be central to any account of\njustice. \nThis section makes clear that a capability theory of justice is\ntheoretically much more demanding than the basic presupposition of the\ncapability approach that ‘functionings’ and\n‘capabilities’ are the best metric for most kinds of\ninterpersonal evaluations. While much has been written on the\ncapability approach in recent years, by an increasing number of\nscholars, including philosophers, much of the philosophical work\nneeded for turning the open-ended capability approach into a specific\ntheory of justice remains to be done. \nWhile most of the philosophical contributions to the literature has\ntended to take place within the Western philosophical tradition\n(Nussbaum 2020, section 1.1) — however one defines this\ntradition — some more recent literature has begun to explore how\nnon-Western philosophies, such as Maori philosophy, Ubuntu, and Buen\nVivir, can contribute to the development of the capability approach\nand vice versa (Bockstael and Watene 2016). \nSome of this literature employs the capability approach to\nconceptualize the rights of Indigenous peoples. Panzironi (2012), for\nexample, introduces the notion of ‘Indigenous capability\nrights,’ while Murphy (2014) argues that Indigenous\nself-determination can be conceptualized as a collective capability.\nSimilarly, Binder and Binder (2016) argue that the recognition\nthat the value of capabilities is culture- and context-specific,\nwithin (at least Sen’s version of) the capability approach, can\nhelp ground Indigenous rights to autonomous self-governance and\nself-determination. \nAnother part of this literature aims to show how Indigenous\nphilosophies and concepts can help particular applications of the\ncapability approach, in particular in relation to sustainable human\ndevelopment and environmental justice. Schlosberg and Carruthers\n(2010) argue that environmental justice for Indigenous peoples must\ninclude a concern for developing their capabilities. Watene (2016)\nargues that the capability approach in its present form is unable to\ncapture the physical and spiritual relation to nature that many\nIndigenous peoples, in particular the Maori, have. As a possible\nsolution, Watene and Yap (2015) show how Indigenous values and\nworldviews, such as a holistic relationship to nature, can contribute\nto develop notions of sustainable development. The notion of\ninterconnectedness — between human individuals and between\nhumans and nature — is also prominent in work that relates the\ncapability approach to the African philosophy of Ubuntu (Hoffmann and\nMetz 2017; Metz 2016) and that it can even be seen as an\n‘architectonic capability,’ which highlights the\ninterdependency of capabilities. \nHowever, given the panoply of non-Western philosophies, more research\nis needed to explore the capability approach in relation to, for\nexample, Chinese and Buddhist philosophy (see though Nussbaum 2020,\nsection 1.2). Argenton and Rossi (2013), however, questions whether\nthe commitment to scrutiny, reasoning, and deliberation of values\nwithin most philosophical applications of the capability approach does\nnot, in fact, run contrary to the ambition of representing the\nplurality and context-specificity of values that individuals have\nbecause this commitment relies on a substantively\nliberal understanding of what it means to be a reasonable and\ndeliberative agent found in the Western philosophical tradition. \nAs mentioned, most of the philosophical capability literature takes\nplace within the practical strand of philosophy with the aim of\naddressing real-life issues. For readers interested in how the\ncapability approach is applied to particular sub-branches of\nphilosophy, this section provides a short overview of some of the most\nprominent contributions. This overview does not aim at completeness,\nbut rather wants to give a sense of the wide range of practical\nconcerns to which the capability approach is applied. \nOne of the most prominent contributions of the capability approach is\nto the field of development ethics (Drydyk and Keleher 2018). Most\nimportantly, the capability approach has been central to the\ndevelopment of the notion of human development (Fukuda-Parr 2002;\n2003; 2011a; 2011b; Fukuda-Parr and Kumar 2003) and the\nmulti-dimensional measures used to evaluate countries’\ndevelopment levels in the annual Human Development Reports (ul Haq\n2003). Scholars who apply the capability approach to development have\ntended to highlight the necessity of taking into account issues of\nfreedom (Sen 1999), agency (Crocker 2008; Keleher and Kosko 2019),\nempowerment (Drydyk 2013), and self-determination (Binder and Binder\n2016; Byskov 2018b; Murphy 2014). \nAnother influential application of the capability approach has been\nwithin the field of public health ethics and health justice. Both Prah\nRuger (2009) and Venkatapuram (2011) have articulated comprehensive\ntheories of health justice, the latter of which has influenced the\nwork of the World Health Organization. Nielsen (2015) provides an\nargument for why capability theorists should care about health, namely\nbecause of its constitutive role in human well-being and agency.\nByskov (2019) argues that the capability approach requires a\nqualitative rather than quantitative interpretation of the principle\nof the least restrictive means, which is central to public health\nethics (Beauchamp and Childress 2001). Applied to healthcare ethics,\nEntwistle and Watt (2013a; 2013b) argue that a capability approach\nrequires the adoption of person-centred care, while Millar (2013)\nargues that the capability approach can be used to evaluate the\njustice of infectious disease control measures within healthcare\ninstitutions. The capability approach has also been widely adopted by\nphilosophers as a framework to analyze aspects of the ethics and\nphilosophy of disability (Harnacke 2013; Nussbaum 2006; Riddle 2013;\n2014; Terzi 2010; Wynne Bannister and Venkatapuram 2020). \nThe capability approach has also been applied to a wide variety of\naspects of environmental ethics and climate justice. Several edited\ncollections have focused on the concept of sustainable development\nfrom a capability perspective, also linking to questions of global and\nintergenerational justice (Gutwald et al. 2014; Lessmann and\nRauschmayer 2014). Holland (2008a; 2008b; 2014a; 2014b) argues that\nenvironmental justice entails limits to the kinds of capabilities that\npeople can choose to realize. Schlosberg and Carruthers (2010;\nSchlosberg 2012) argue that environmental justice must include a\nconcern for developing capabilities, an argument which Kronlid (2014)\nextends to climate adaptation planning. Voget-Kleschin (2013; 2015)\nuses the capability approach to investigate reasons for ecologically\nsustainable consumption patterns and lifestyles while Kramm (2020)\nshows that the capability approach can be used to conceptualize the\nwell-being of a river, which is needed in order to ground claims to\nlegal personhood for rivers, such as the Whanganui River in New\nZealand. \nThe capability approach has also been influential in developing the\nright to education and educational justice (Walker and Unterhalter\n2007). Most prominently, Walker (2003; 2006) and Unterhalter (2005;\n2007; 2013) have been at the forefront of conceptualizing social\njustice within education, while Terzi (2008) argues that social\njustice and equality in education require particular attention to\nspecial educational needs and disability. A related literature has\ncontributed to the conceptualization of childrens’ rights and\ndevelopment (Brando and Schweiger 2019; Ferracioli and Terlazzo 2014;\nHart and Brando 2018). \nThe potential applications of the capability approach are wide-ranging\nand possible areas where nascent research has begun, or more research\nis needed, include the philosophy of technology and the ethical\naspects of artificial intelligence and surveillance (Oosterlaken 2011;\n2015); business ethics and corporate social responsibility (Bertland\n2009; Giovanola 2009; Sferrazzo and Ruffini forthcoming); animal ethics and\nthe rights of of non-human animals (Bendik-Keymer 2014; Cripps 2010;\nNussbaum 2011b; Palmer 2010); and professional ethics and the rights\nof employees.","contact.mail":"i.a.m.robeyns@uu.nl","contact.domain":"uu.nl"},{"date.published":"2011-04-14","date.changed":"2020-12-10","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/capability-approach/","author1":"Ingrid Robeyns","author2":"Morten Fibieger Byskov","author1.info":"http://www.uu.nl/staff/IAMRobeyns/0","entry":"capability-approach","body.text":"\n\n\nThe capability approach is a theoretical framework that entails two\nnormative claims: first, the claim that the freedom to achieve\nwell-being is of primary moral importance and, second, that well-being\nshould be understood in terms of people’s capabilities and\nfunctionings. Capabilities are the doings and beings that people can\nachieve if they so choose, such as being well-nourished, getting\nmarried, being educated, and travelling; functionings are capabilities\nthat have been realized. Whether someone can convert a set of means -\nresources and public goods - into a functioning (i.e., whether she has\na particular capability) crucially depends on certain personal,\nsociopolitical, and environmental conditions, which, in the capability\nliterature, are called ‘conversion factors.’ Capabilities\nhave also been referred to as real or substantive freedoms as they\ndenote the freedoms that have been cleared of any potential obstacles,\nin contrast to mere formal rights and freedoms.\n\n\nWithin philosophy, the capability approach has been employed to the\ndevelopment of several conceptual and normative theories within, most\nprominently, development ethics, political philosophy, public health\nethics, environmental ethics and climate justice, and philosophy of\neducation. This proliferation of capability literature has led to\nquestions concerning what kind of framework it is (section 1); how its\ncore concepts should be defined (section 2); how it can be further\nspecified for particular purposes (section 3); what is needed to\ndevelop the capability approach into an account of social justice\n(section 4); how it relates to non-Western philosophies (section 5);\nand how it can be and has been applied in practice (section\n6). \n\nAlthough we can trace some aspects of the capability approach back to,\namong others, Aristotle, Adam Smith, and Karl Marx (see Nussbaum 1988,\n1992, 2020; Sen 1993a, 1999: 14, 24; Walsh 2000), it is\neconomist-philosopher Amartya Sen who pioneered the approach and\nphilosopher Martha Nussbaum and a growing number of other scholars\nacross the humanities and the social sciences who have significantly\ndeveloped it. The capability approach purports that freedom to achieve\nwell-being is a matter of what people are able to do and to be, and\nthus the kind of life they are effectively able to lead. \nThe capability approach has its origins in a number of articles in\nwhich Sen (1974; 1979a; 1979b) criticizes the limited informational\nbases of the traditional economic models and evaluative accounts\n(i.e., utilitarianism and resourcism). What is missing from these\ntraditional models, Sen argues, is a notion of what activities we are\nable to undertake (‘doings’) and the kinds of persons we\nare able to be (‘beings’). Sen calls this\nnotion capabilities. Capabilities are the real\nfreedoms that people have to achieve their potential doings and\nbeings. Real freedom in this sense means that one has all the required\nmeans necessary to achieve that doing or being if one wishes to. That\nis, it is not merely the formal freedom to do or be something, but the\nsubstantial opportunity to achieve it.  \nIn this way, the capability approach changes the focus from means (the\nresources people have and the public goods they can access) to ends\n(what they are able to do and be with those resources and goods).\nThis shift in focus is justified because resources and goods alone do\nnot ensure that people are able to convert them into actual doings and\nbeings. Two persons with similar sets of goods and resources may\nnevertheless be able to achieve very different ends depending on their\ncircumstances.  \nOne of the most prominent illustrations within the capability\nliterature of the need to move beyond a focus on goods and resources\nis found in Sen’s (1979a) “Equality of What?” Tanner\nlectures. Here, Sen asks us to consider two persons with the same set\nof resources. Yet, one person suffers from a disability. This\ndisability makes her unequal to the able-bodied person in two regards,\nwhich cannot be captured by a sole focus on resources. First of all,\nthe disabled person is unequal in terms of what she can do or be with\nher resources compared with the physically able person. She may, for\nexample, be confined to a wheelchair and thus restricted to places\nthat are wheelchair-accessible. Secondly, the disabled person may even\nbe doubly worse off because she only gets the same amount of resources\neven though she has more expenses in order to correct for her\ndisability. That is, because the disabled person needs to spend a\nconsiderable amount of her resources on a wheelchair merely to\nmove around, she has fewer resources available to pursue other\ngoals than the able-bodied person who can spend all her resources on\npursuing her valued ends. Thus, in order to evaluate people’s\nwell-being, we need to not only consider the amount of resources they\nhave, but also what they are able to do and be with those\nresources.    \nIn “Equality of What?” Sen also objects to utilitarian\nmeasures of well-being. According to a utilitarian measure,\nsomeone’s well-being should be evaluated in terms of the amount\nof utility, such as pleasure or happiness, that they derive from the\nresources and goods that they have. Consequently, a utilitarian may\nargue that the above example only shows that we ought to\ndistribute more resources, goods, and freedoms to\nthe disabled person to the extent that she experiences the same amount\nof well-being as the able-bodied person. As Sen (1979a) has shown,\nhowever, this response is inadequate. The disabled person may be a\npleasure wizard who gains a lot of utility from very little input.\nConversely, the able-bodied person may be very hard to please and thus\nrequires a large input of resources and freedoms in order to detect an\nincrease in well-being. In this case, Sen notes, the amended\nutilitarian position would actually direct more resources and freedoms\nto the able-bodied person and less to the disabled one. But surely it\ncannot be right to provide less help to those with greater needs,\nmerely because they are easier to satisfy. As Sen himself has\ndocumented, people living in deprivation may actually tend to lower\ntheir expectations as a coping mechanism (e.g., Kynch and Sen 1983).\nBut just because they experience a bigger increase in well-being from\nfewer resources, it does not mean that the situation is justified or\njustifiable in the first place.  \nPhilosophical accounts of well-being, freedom, and justice should thus\nrecognize the diversity of human needs and personal and contextual\ncircumstances. This is exactly what the notions of capabilities and\nfunctionings do. By focusing on what people are able to do and be,\nrather than merely on the distribution of goods and resources, the\ncapability approach recognizes the diversity of people’s ability\nto convert those resources and goods into real opportunities and\nachievements - the kind of life they are effectively able to lead. \nThe capability approach is generally conceived as a flexible and\nmulti-purpose framework, rather than a precise theory of well-being\n(Qizilbash 2008; Robeyns 2005, 94-96; Sen 1992; 2009). This open-ended\nand underspecified nature partly explains why the term\n‘capability approach’ was chosen and is now used in the\nphilosophical literature rather than, say, ‘capability\ntheory’. The terms ‘capability approach’ and\n‘capabilities approach’ are both used in the literature to\nrefer to the same thing, though the latter is often considered to\nrefer more specifically to Nussbaum’s partial theory of\njustice. Some philosophers have started to use the term\n‘capabilitarianism’ (Robeyns 2016; Nielsen and Axelsen\n2017). The proliferation of literature on the capability approach has\nengendered a discussion about how to exactly define and understand\nit. \nDespite some philosophical disagreements about the best description of\nthe capability approach, it is generally understood as a conceptual\nframework for a range of normative exercises, including most\nprominently the following: (1) the assessment of individual\nwell-being; (2) the evaluation and assessment of social arrangements;\nand (3) the design of policies and proposals about social change in\nsociety. In all these normative exercises, the capability approach\nprioritizes certain of peoples’ beings and doings and their\nopportunities to realize those beings and doings (such as their\ngenuine opportunities to be educated, their ability to move around or\nto enjoy supportive social relationships). This stands in contrast to\nother accounts of well-being, which focus exclusively on subjective\ncategories (such as happiness) or on the material means to well-being\n(such as resources like income or wealth). \nNussbaum (2011a) has described the general capability approach (not\nher own specific theory) as consisting of two clusters, one focussing\non comparative quality of life and the other on theorising about\njustice. The two clusters would share a focus on what people are able\ndoing and being, and would share a commitment to five principles:\ntreating each person as an end; a focus on choice and freedom rather\nthan achievements; pluralism about values; being deeply concerned with\nentrenched social injustices; and ascribing an urgent task to\ngovernment. However, it has been argued that only two of those\n(namely, treating each person as an end and pluralism about values)\nare genuinely essential to each and every capability theory, and that\nin addition there exists work in the capability approach that does not\nneatly fit into one of the two clusters that Nussbaum proposes\n(Robeyns 2016).  \nIn contrast to Nussbaum’s narrow understanding of the capability\napproach, Robeyns (2017) argues that we can and should distinguish\nbetween, on the one hand, the capability approach as an underspecified\nand open-ended framework and, on the other hand, the capability\napproach as more specific capability theories. The capability approach\nshould be defined as a normative framework, which can host a wide\nvariety of more specific theories and applications, such as, for\nexample, Nussbaum’s partial capability theory of justice,\nCrocker’s capability theory of deliberative democracy, and\ncapabilitarian econometrics. Likewise, Qizilbash (2012) argues that\nthe capability approach should be seen as a ‘thin’\nframework, which can be filled in by ‘thicker’ theories\nand applications. While all of these accounts may differ greatly in\ntheir specific structure, purpose, and normative commitments, they all\nadhere to the same normative core, namely a normative commitment to\nconceptualize well-being in terms of capabilities and\nfunctionings. \nThis core can then be supplemented through certain choices (see\nsections\n 2\n and\n 3),\n such as a particular purpose, methodological and meta-theoretical\ncommitments, and additional normative values to develop more\nparticular theories, such as a capability theory of justice or\ndemocracy, or applied to particular tasks, such as empirical studies\nor the conceptualization of education, health, and so\non.   \nConfusingly, within the literature the term ‘the capability\napproach’ has also often been used to refer not to this overall\nframework, but rather to a more specific capability theory, namely\nNussbaum’s (2000; 2011a) partial capability theory of justice,\nSen’s (2006; 2008; 2009) theory of transitional justice, or\nSen’s (1999) theory of development as freedom. Many capability\ntheorists have long believed that the capability approach has a\nnormative commitment to expand certain doings and beings that people\nhave reason to value, as Sen has proposed. However, it is possible to\ndevelop capability theories that differ significantly from\nNussbaum’s and Sen’s capability theories. For example,\nempirical applications of the capability framework do not necessarily\nhave to be committed to the political liberalism of Nussbaum’s\napproach or the expansion of valuable capabilities, while a theory of\neducational justice, such as the one developed by Walker and\nUnterhalter (2007), will differ quite drastically from a theory of\nhealth justice, like the ones developed by Venkatapuram (2011) or Prah\nRuger (2009; 2010). Moreover, the capability framework can and has\nbeen used for non-normative purposes, including the conceptualization\nof various phenomena, such as sharing of urban space, and the\nmeasurement of capabilities through both qualitative and quantitative\nresearch. These non-normative applications differ widely in their\nmethodological approaches and are not (necessarily) committed to the\nexpansion of capabilities. \nThe capability approach often provides one element in the\ndevelopment of an account of justice, social progress, development, or\nsomething else. For example, Crocker (2008) has extended the\ncapability approach with accounts of agency and participation into a\nmore detailed account of development ethics, but discusses at length\nthat not all versions of the capability approach are embracing agency\nso explicitly. Similarly, the capability approach can be developed\ninto an alternative evaluative tool that can replace traditional\nsocial cost-benefit analysis (Alkire 2002). Or it can be used as a\nnormative framework within which to evaluate and design policies and\nsocial institutions, ranging from welfare-state design in relatively\naffluent societies (Wolff and de-Shalit 2007), to governmental and\nnongovernmental development policies in poor countries, to policies\nthat affluent countries and international institutions employ (or are\nadvised to employ) in their efforts to aid poor countries, such as the\nUNDP’s Human Development Reports.  \nAt the core of the capability approach is a normative commitment to\nconceptualize well-being in terms of capabilities and\nfunctionings. Functionings are ‘doings and beings’,\nthat is, various states of human beings and activities that a person\ncan undertake, such as being well-nourished, getting married,\nbeing educated, and travelling, while capabilities are the real, or\nsubstantive, opportunity that they have to achieve these doings and\nbeings. (See\n section 2.2\n for a discussion of real/substantive freedom.) A person’s\n‘capability-set’ denotes the set of capabilities that he\nor she can choose from, while the term ‘basic\ncapabilities’ refers either to “the innate equipment of\nindividuals that is necessary for developing the more advanced\ncapabilities”, such as the capability of speech and language,\nwhich is present in a newborn but needs to be fostered (Nussbaum 2000,\n84), or to the freedom to do some basic things considered necessary\nfor survival and to avoid or escape poverty or other serious\ndeprivation (Sen 1992, 45, fn. 19). The relevance of basic\ncapabilities is “not so much in ranking living standards, but in\ndeciding on a cut-off point for the purpose of assessing poverty and\ndeprivation” (Sen 1987b, 109). \nRecently, there has been a discussion within the capability literature\nabout whether capabilities and functionings should be limited to\nonly encompass positively valued doings and beings — such\nas according to a normative theory, those that we have reason to\nvalue, or those which promote some ultimate normative aim, such as\nhuman dignity or agency — or whether capabilities and\nfunctionings are value-neutral concepts that encompass not only\nnormatively positive but also negative and neutral doings and beings\n(Byskov 2020; Robeyns 2017). \nWhy is the value-laden definition of capabilities problematic,\naccording to its critics? First, if what counts as a capability is -\nby definition - normatively valuable then it\nrisks ignoring that the value of a certain set of capabilities\nand functionings may also crucially depend on what it does\nnot allow one to do or be or if it allows one to realize\nmorally bad functionings, such as committing murder or polluting\n(Carter 2014; Dowding and Van Hees 2009). The value-laden conception\nof capabilities analytically excludes such non-normatively valued\ndoings and beings from consideration, even though they may be just as\nimportant for the valuation of a capability-set as positively valued\ndoings and beings. \nThe second reason why the value-laden definition might be problematic\nis because it excludes applications of the capability framework that\nare not concerned with what is valuable or not, and in some cases are\nconcerned with morally bad capabilities. Two such capability\napplications are the conceptualization of phenomena and empirical\npurposes. For example, an empirical study that investigates the\nprevalence of domestic violence in a society would be concerned with\nwhether husbands have capability (and functioning) of exercising such\nviolence - a clear-cut case of a morally bad, yet highly relevant,\ncapability. Thus, if the definition of capabilities and functionings\nis limited to only encompass normatively valuable or positive doings\nand beings, it excludes applications of the capability approach that\nare concerned with morally bad doings and beings and capability\napplications that are not concerned with whether capabilities are\nvaluable or not.   \nIn contrast to the value-laden definition, proponents of the\nvalue-neutral definition of capabilities and functionings hold that\ndoings and beings can be both positively and negatively valued as\nwell as normatively neutral. A capability, according to this\ndefinition, is simply the freedom that people have to do or be certain\nthings. Examples of capabilities that are usually evaluated positively\nare being well-nourished, sheltered, and educated, while examples of\ncapabilities that are usually negatively valued are the ability to\nkill (Stewart and Deneulin 2002, 67), the ability to rape, being\nvulnerable to natural hazards, and being able to pollute (Holland\n2008, 418; Nussbaum 2006, 166). Because both positively and negatively\nvalued capabilities determine how well-off we are, it is necessary\nthat capabilities are defined in a way that includes both. \nOther capabilities, meanwhile, are morally ambiguous or morally\nneutral. An example of a morally ambiguous capability is the\ncapability to care or provide care, which can at different times\neither be rewarding, for example for parents caring for a child, and a\nburden, especially for women who often face societal pressure to take\non the brunt of care activities. An example of a morally neutral\ncapability is the ability to choose between two equally effective and\nsustainable brands of washing liquid (Williams 1987). On the face of\nit, whether we can choose between different brands of washing liquid\nis of little relevance if our purpose is to conceptualize healthcare\nor if we are interested in measuring a rural community’s access\nto infrastructure. However, that is not to say that prima\nfacie irrelevant doings and beings cannot become relevant.\nIf, for example, one brand of washing liquid were shown to have a\npositive or negative effect on health, then it would be relevant for a\ncapabilitarian conceptualization of health to include the capability\nto choose between different brands of washing liquid. No doings and\nbeings are a priori irrelevant and, according to\nits proponents, only a value-neutral definition of capabilities can\naccommodate for this fact. \nLastly, it should be noted that it is only necessary to adopt the\nvalue-neutral definition at the level of the capability approach as a\ngeneral framework. Although the concept of\ncapabilities is value-neutral, for more particular purposes and\ntheories it will be useful and probably necessary to further specify\nby which criteria we make a selection of capabilities, according to\nthat purpose or theory, and whether it will only focus on valuable\ndoings and beings or also take bad capabilities into account (see\n section 3.2\n for a discussion of the selection of\ncapabilities).    \nIt has been mentioned above that capabilities are defined as the real,\nor substantive, freedoms that people have to achieve certain doings\nand beings. A frequent misunderstanding in the secondary\nliterature concerns the use of the term ‘freedom’.\nEspecially in his later work, Sen often equates capabilities with\nfreedoms, without always specifying in more detail what kind of\nfreedoms he is referring to. Yet this equation can easily be\nmisunderstood since, as Sen himself acknowledges, there are many kinds\nof freedom (some valuable, some detrimental, and some trivial) and\n‘freedom’ means very different things to different\npeople. \nOne important misunderstanding to get out of the way is that\ncapabilities as freedoms refer exclusively to the “free\nmarket.” Sen (1993b) does argue that people have reason to value\nthe freedom or liberty to produce, buy, and sell in markets. This\npoint, however, is part of his more general work on development, and\nis a very different matter than the highly disputed question in\neconomics and politics regarding the benefits and limits of the market\nas a system of economic production and distribution. Functionings and\ncapabilities are conceptualizations of well-being achievements and\nwell-being freedoms, and the question which economic institutions are\nthe best institutional means to foster functionings and capabilities\nis both analytically but also politically a question that can only be\nsettled after we first agree what economic outcomes we should be\naiming at—and this is a question to which the capability\napproach gives a (partial) answer. \nYet if Sen and other capability scholars label capabilities as\nfreedoms, then what kind of freedoms are capabilities? As Kaufman\n(2006a) has shown, understanding capability as an opportunity concept\nof freedom, rather than some other kind of freedom, may undermine\nmistaken critiques on Sen’s work. A careful reading of\nSen’s work clarifies that capabilities are freedoms conceived as\nreal opportunities (Sen 1985a, 3–4; 1985d, 201;\n2002, chapter 20).  \nReal freedom in this sense means that one has all the required means\nnecessary to achieve that doing and being if one wishes to. That is,\nit is not merely the formal freedom to do or be something, but the\nsubstantial opportunity to achieve it. Someone might, for example,\nhave the formal freedom to vote in elections in the sense that she has\nthe right to do so and that no one will stop her from doing so, but\nshe might lack the substantial possibility to vote because the closest\nvoting station is 200 kilometers away and she does not own a car and\ndoes not have access to other means of transportation. Conversely,\nsomeone may be living close to the voting station but still may not\nhave the real freedom to vote because females are not permitted to\nvote in that particular society or they risk bodily harm if exercising\ntheir formal voting rights. Capabilities are thus real freedoms in the\nsense that they are corrected for any potential\nimpediments. Functionings simply denotes those\ncapabilities that have been achieved whether voluntarily or by chance.\nFor example, someone might have the real freedom to vote but chooses\nnot to do so and thus does not have the functioning of voting. \nAnother question about freedom in the capability approach concerns\nwhether, or the extent to which, it corresponds to other concepts of\nfreedom within the philosophical literature, such as positive and\nnegative freedom. While more research is needed in this regard, some\nscholars have argued that the concept of freedom in the capability\napproach most resembles the concept of freedom as non-domination\nwithin republicanism, albeit with some notable caveats and\ndisagreement (Alexander 2010; List 2004; Pettit 2001; 2009; Sen 1983;\n2001).  \nWhether someone has the capability to achieve a certain doing or being\ndepends on so-called ‘conversion factors’ (Sen 1992,\n19-21, 26-30, 37-38). Resources, such as marketable goods and\nservices, but also goods and services emerging from the non-market\neconomy, including household production, have certain characteristics\nthat make them of interest to people. For example, we may be\ninterested in a bike not because it is an object made from certain\nmaterials with a specific shape and color, but because it can take us\nto places where we want to go, and in a faster way than if we were\nwalking. These characteristics of a good or commodity enable or\ncontribute to a functioning. A bike enables the functioning of\nmobility, to be able to move oneself freely and more rapidly than\nwalking. The relation between a good and the achievement of certain\nbeings and doings is captured with the term ‘conversion\nfactor’: the degree in which a person can transform a resource\ninto a functioning. For example, an able bodied person who was taught\nto ride a bicycle when he was a child has a high conversion factor\nenabling him to turn the bicycle into the ability to move around\nefficiently, whereas a person with a physical impairment or someone\nwho was never taught to ride a bike has a very low conversion factor.\nThe conversion factors thus represent how much functioning one can get\nout of a good or service; in our example, how much mobility the person\ncan get out of a bicycle. \nNote that on the most plausible reading of Sen (1985a), he is\nconcerned with the conversion of more tangible resources. There is no\nreason, however, that we should not be equally concerned with the\nconversion of more intangible resources, such as human capital and\npublic goods. In distinguishing between human capital and human\ncapabilities, for example, Sen (1997) seems to acknowledge that\nintangible resources (such as human capital) are merely means to\ncapabilities in the relevant sense. \nThere are several different types of conversion factors, and the\nconversion factors discussed are often categorized into three groups.\nAll conversion factors influence how a person can be or is free to\nconvert the characteristics of the resources into a functioning, yet\nthe sources of these factors may differ. Personal conversion\nfactors are internal to the person, such as metabolism, physical\ncondition, sex, reading skills, or intelligence. If a person is\ndisabled, is in bad physical condition, or has never learned to cycle,\nthen the bike will be of limited help in enabling the functioning of\nmobility. Social conversion factors are factors from the\nsociety in which one lives, such as public policies, social norms,\npractices that unfairly discriminate, societal hierarchies, or power\nrelations related to, for example, class, gender, race, or caste.\nEnvironmental conversion factors emerge from the physical or\nbuilt environment in which a person lives. Among aspects of\none’s geographical location are climate, pollution, the\nproneness to earthquakes, and the presence or absence of seas and\noceans. Among aspects of the built environment are the stability of\nbuildings, roads, and bridges, and the means of transportation and\ncommunication. Take the example of the bicycle. How much a bicycle\ncontributes to a person’s mobility depends on that\nperson’s physical condition (a personal conversion factor), the\nsocial mores including whether women are socially allowed to ride a\nbicycle (a social conversion factor), and the available of decent\nroads or bike paths (an environmental conversion factor). \nThe three types of conversion factors all stress that it is not\nsufficient to know the resources a person owns or can use in order to\nbe able to assess the well-being that he or she has achieved or could\nachieve; rather, we need to know much more about the person and the\ncircumstances in which he or she is living. Sen uses\n“capability” not to refer exclusively to a person’s\nabilities or other internal powers but to refer to an opportunity made\nfeasible, and constrained by, both internal (personal) and external\n(social and environmental) conversion factors. The real\nfreedom someone has to ride a bicycle is thus dependent on\nwhether these conditions are fulfilled and, in this sense, conversion\nfactors also shape the needs of the individuals in\nquestion: in a society in which the capability of riding a bicycle is\nimportant (e.g., in order to get to work), it becomes crucial to\nprovide decent roads and an adequate infrastructure (Crocker and\nRobeyns 2009, 68). \nLastly, whereas the capability approach usually focuses on the\nconversion of resources into individual capabilities and functionings,\nsome scholars have argued that this is too individualistic (Evans\n2002; Gore 1997; Stewart 2005). In fact, it is argued, many\ncapabilities can only be held or achieved through collective action.\nThis has resulted in the notion of ‘collective\ncapabilities’ (Ibrahim 2006; 2020). For example, the\ncapabilities for friendship, assembly, and political speech can only\nbe held or realized in collaboration with other individuals\n(Ibrahim 2020, 210). Likewise, Binder (2009; 2019) argues that\ncultural contexts influence individual agency goals and thus the\ncapabilities that we choose to pursue. In these ways, social\nrelations, collectives, and the larger social, cultural, and\ninstitutional context function as conversion factors for some\ncapabilities. Robeyns (2017, section 4.6), however, argues that the\ncollectivist critique conflates the capability approach’s\ncommitment to normative, or ethical, individualism (i.e., “that\nindividuals, and only individuals, are the units\nof ultimate moral concern”) with a commitment\nto methodological, or ontological, individualism — that\n“all social phenomena are to be explained wholly or exclusively\nin terms of their properties” (Bhargava 1992, 19). Although\nthe capability approach, according to Robeyns, is committed to the\nformer, it does not necessarily follow that collectives and social\nrelations have no bearing on how those capabilities are\nrealized.  \nAs the notion of conversion factors show, the capability approach\nexplicitly endorses and relies upon a key analytical distinction in\npractical philosophy, namely the means-ends distinction. The approach\nstresses that we should always be clear, when valuing something,\nwhether we value it as an end in itself, or as a means to a valuable\nend. For the capability approach, the ultimate ends of interpersonal\ncomparisons are people’s capabilities. This implies that the\ncapability approach evaluates policies and other changes according to\ntheir impact on people’s capabilities as well as their actual\nfunctionings. It asks whether people are able to be healthy, and\nwhether the means or resources necessary for this capability, such as\nclean water, adequate sanitation, access to doctors, protection from\ninfections and diseases, and basic knowledge on health issues, are\npresent. It asks whether people are well-nourished, and whether the\nmeans or conditions for the realization of this capability, such as\nhaving sufficient food supplies and food entitlements, are being met.\nIt asks whether people have access to a high-quality education system,\nto real political participation, and to community activities that\nsupport them, that enable them to cope with struggles in daily life,\nand that foster caring and warm friendships. \nMuch of the critique that capability theorists have advanced against\nalternative normative frameworks (such as Dworkinian resourcism, or\nthe Rawlsian social primary goods approach), can be traced back to the\nobjection that alternative approaches value particular means to\nwell-being rather than the ends. The main reason why the capability\napproach holds that it is better to focus on the ends rather than the\nmeans, is that people differ in their ability to convert means into\nvaluable opportunities (capabilities) or outcomes (functionings) (Sen\n1992: 26–28, 36–38). (See\n section 1.1.)\n Since ends are what ultimately matters when thinking about well-being\nand the quality of life, means can only work as reliable proxies of\npeople’s opportunities to achieve those ends if they all have\nthe same capacities or powers to convert those means into equal\ncapability sets. Capability scholars believe that these\ninter-individual differences are far-reaching and significant, and\nthat theories that focus on means tend to downplay their normative\nrelevance. In the theoretical framework of the capability approach,\nthese inter-individual differences are captured by the notion of\n‘conversion factors’ (see\n section 2.3). \nOne could argue, however, that the capability approach does not focus\nentirely on ends, but rather on the question whether a person is being\nput in the conditions in which she can pursue her ultimate ends. For\nexample, being able to read could be seen as not an ultimate end in\nitself, since people’s ultimate ends will be more specific, such\nas reading street signs, the newspaper, or the Bible or Koran. It is\ntherefore somewhat more precise to say that the capability approach\nfocuses on people’s ends in terms of beings and doings expressed\nin general terms: being literate, being mobile, being able to hold a\ndecent job. Whether a particular person then decides to translate\nthese general capabilities in the more specific capabilities\nA, B or C (e.g., reading street signs,\nreading the newspaper, or reading the Bible), is up to them. Whether\nthat person decides to stay put, travel to the US or rather to China,\nis not normatively relevant for the capability approach: the question\nis rather whether a person has these capabilities in more general\nterms. \nOf course, the normative focus on ends does not imply that the\ncapability approach does not at all value means such as material or\nfinancial resources. Instead, a capability analysis will typically\nalso focus on resources and other means, such as human capital (Sen\n1985a; 1997). For example, in their evaluation of development in\nIndia, Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen (2002: 3) have stressed that\nworking within the capability approach in no way excludes the\nintegration of an analysis of resources, such as food, or other\nresources. In sum, all the means of well-being, like the availability\nof commodities, legal entitlements to them, other social institutions,\nand so forth, are important, but the capability approach\npresses the point that they are not the ends of well-being, only their\nmeans. Food may be abundant in the village, but a starving person may\nhave nothing to exchange for it, no legal claim on it, or no way of\npreventing intestinal parasites from consuming it before he or she\ndoes. In all these cases at least some resources will be available,\nbut it will still leave that person hungry and, after a while,\nundernourished. \nYet one could wonder: would it not be better to focus on means\nonly, rather than making the normative analysis more complicated and\nmore informationally demanding by also focusing on functionings and\ncapabilities? Capability scholars would respond that starting a\nnormative analysis from the ends rather than means has at least two\nadvantages, apart from the earlier mentioned fundamental reason that a\nfocus on ends is needed to appropriately capture inter-individual\ndifferences. First, the valuation of means will retain the status of\nan instrumental valuation rather than take on the nature of an\nintrinsic valuation. For example, money or economic growth will not be\nvalued for their own sake, but only in so far as they contribute to an\nexpansion of people’s capabilities. Second, by starting from\nends, we do not a priori assume that there is only one overridingly\nimportant means to that ends (such as income), but rather explicitly\nask the question which types of means are important for the fostering\nand nurturing of a particular capability, or set of capabilities. For\nsome capabilities, the most important means will indeed be financial\nresources and economic production, but for others it may be particular\npolitical practices and institutions, such as effective guarantees and\nprotections of freedom of thought, political participation, social or\ncultural practices, social structures, social institutions, public\ngoods, social norms, and traditions and habits. As a consequence, an\neffective capability-enhancing policy may not exist in increasing\ndisposable income, but rather fighting a homophobic, ethnophobic,\nracist or sexist social climate. \nA strong acknowledgment of human diversity is one of the key\ntheoretical driving forces of the capability approach. Its criticism\nof other normative approaches is often fueled by, and based on, the\nclaim that the full human diversity among people is insufficiently\nacknowledged in many normative theories, such as theories of\ndistributive justice. This also explains why the capability approach\nis often favorably regarded by feminist philosophers, or philosophers\nconcerned with care and disability issues (e.g. Khader 2008, Terzi\n2008, 2010), since one of their main complaints about mainstream moral\nand political philosophy has precisely been the relative invisibility\nof the fate of those people whose lives did not correspond to that of\nan able-bodied, non-dependent, caregiving-free individual who belongs\nto the dominant ethnic, racial and religious group. People of color,\nmarginalized people, the disabled and many women do not fit that\npicture. \nThe capability approach thus takes account of human diversity in at\nleast three ways. First, by its focus on the plurality of functionings\nand capabilities as important evaluative spaces. By including a wide\nrange of dimensions in the conceptualization of well-being and\nwell-being outcomes, the approach broadens the so-called\n‘informational basis’ of assessments, and thereby includes\nsome dimensions that may be particularly important for some groups but\nless so for others. For example, in standard outcome assessments,\nwomen as a group virtually always end up being worse off than men. But\nif the selection of outcome dimensions is shifted to also include the\nquality and quantity of social relations and support, and being able\nto engage in hands-on care, then the normative assessment of gender\ninequality becomes less univocal and requires much further argument\nand normative defense, including being explicit about how to aggregate\ndifferent dimensions (Robeyns 2003). \nSecondly, human diversity is stressed in the capability approach by\nthe explicit focus on personal and socio-environmental conversion\nfactors that make possible the conversion of commodities and other\nresources into functionings, and on the social, institutional, and\nenvironmental context that affects the conversion factors and the\ncapability set directly. Each individual has a unique profile of\nconversion factors, some of which are body-related, others of which\nare shared with all people from her community, and still others of\nwhich are shared with people with the same social characteristics\n(e.g., same gender or class or race characteristics). \nThird, human diversity within the capability approach is captured by\nan acknowledgement of human agency and the diversity of goals people\nhave in life. Sen distinguishes between two kinds of freedom, namely\nwhat he calls well-being\nfreedom and agency freedom (Sen 1985d).\nBoth of these can also be analyzed in terms of whether they have been\nachieved. In that case they are called well-being\nachievement and agency achievement. Well-being\nfreedoms are those freedoms that promote our well-being\ngenerally. Being well-nourished, for example, is part of our\nwell-being. But we may also value freedoms that do not promote our\nwell-being, such as giving up a promising career in order to fight for\nglobal justice. My fighting global justice may not provide me with\nanything in terms of well-being as it requires me to travel to some of\nthe most insecure places on earth and does not provide a steady\nincome. I am worse off in terms of well-being compared to the\nalternative of pursuing a promising career. Yet, I value this freedom\nbecause it is an expression of my agency. The recognition of agency\nfreedom, in addition to well-being freedom, allows people to pursue a\ndiversity of doings and beings.  \nAccording to the capability approach, ‘functionings’ and\n‘capabilities’ are the best metric for most kinds of\ninterpersonal evaluations. In other words, those interpersonal\nevaluations should be conceptualized in terms of people’s\nfunctioning and their capabilities. These beings and doings together\nare held to constitute what makes a life valuable. Whereas\n‘functionings’ are the proposed conceptualization for\ninterpersonal comparisons of (achieved) well-being,\n‘capabilities’ are the conceptualization for interpersonal\ncomparisons of the freedom to pursue well-being, which Sen calls\n“well-being freedom” (Sen 1992: 40). \nThe relevant functionings can vary from such elementary things as\nbeing adequately nourished, being in good health, avoiding escapable\nmorbidity and premature mortality, to more complex achievements such\nas having a decent and valuable job, not suffering from lack of\nself-respect, taking active part in the life of the community, and so\non. The claim is that functionings are constitutive of a\nperson’s being, and an evaluation of well-being has to take the\nform of an assessment of these constituent elements (Sen 1992: 39). To\nsay that functionings are constitutive of a person’s being means\nthat one cannot be a human being without having at least a range of\nfunctionings: they make the lives of human beings both lives\n(in contrast to the existence of innate objects) and also\nhuman (in contrast to the lives of trees or tigers). Human\nfunctionings are those beings and doings that we take to constitute a\nhuman life, and which are central in our understandings of ourselves\nas human beings. This implies that the range of potentially relevant\nfunctionings is very broad, and that the capability approach will in\nsome respects be close to both subjective metrics (for example, by\nincluding the capability to be happy), or resources-based metrics\n(since most functionings require some resources as inputs). Yet not\nall beings and doings are functionings; for example, being able to fly\nlike a bird or reaching an age of 200 like an oak tree, are not human\nfunctionings. \nThus, according to the capability approach, the ends of well-being\nfreedom, justice, and development should be conceptualized in terms of\npeople’s capabilities. Moreover, what is relevant is not only\nwhich opportunities are open to me each by themselves, hence in a\npiecemeal way, but rather which combinations or sets of potential\nfunctionings are open to me. For example, suppose I am a low-skilled\npoor single parent who lives in a society without decent social\nprovisions. Take the following functionings: (1) to hold a job, which\nwill require me to spend many hours on working and commuting, but will\ngenerate the income needed to properly feed myself and my family; (2)\nto care for my children at home and give them all the attention, care\nand supervision they need. In a piecemeal analysis, both (1) and (2)\nare opportunities open to me, but they are not both together\nopen to me. The point about the capability approach is precisely that\nwe must take a comprehensive or holistic approach, and ask which\nsets of capabilities are open to me, that is: can I\nsimultaneously provide for my family and properly care for and\nsupervise my children? Or am I rather forced to make some hard,\nperhaps even tragic choices between two functionings which both\nreflect basic needs and basic moral duties? \nNote that while most types of capability analysis require\ninterpersonal comparisons, one could also use the capability approach\nto evaluate the well-being or well-being freedom of one person at one\npoint in time (e.g., evaluate her situation against a\ncapability-yardstick), or to evaluate the changes in her well-being or\nwell-being freedom over time. The capability approach could thus also\nbe used by a single individual in her deliberate decision-making or\nevaluation processes, but these types of uses of the capability\napproach are much less prevalent in the philosophical literature, let\nalone in the social sciences. \nBuilding on its core of central concepts and normative commitments,\nthe capability approach can be developed into more specific capability\ntheories. As Robeyns (2017, chapter 1) argues, some specifications are\nnecessary to make, such as what the purpose of the theory is, what\ncapabilities or functionings are normatively relevant, and whether to\nfocus on capabilities or functionings. Other specifications are\noptional in the sense that whether we need them depends on the\nparticular capability theory we are developing, including how to weigh\ndifferent capabilities against each other and what other normative\nconcerns that the theory should take into consideration. In this\nsection, we explain some of the choices that need to or can be made\nwhen developing a capability theory. \nThe capability approach can be applied to many different purposes and\nthe choice of purpose, or application, of the theory matters for other\nspecifications that are made. \nSome purposes introduce additional normative, descriptive, and/or\nmeta-theoretical commitments. For example, a capability theory of\nenvironmental justice that is grounded in the Western philosophical\ntradition might struggle to account for the protection of non-human\nentities, such as animals, forests, and rivers, in ways that a\ncommitment to non-Western and holistic ontologies might not (Watene\n2016). \nThe choice of purpose also influences the selection of relevant\ncapabilities and functionings and how this selection should be done.\nFor example, applying the capability approach to developing an account\nof health justice invariably entails a focus on those capabilities and\nfunctionings that are relevant for health (Prah Ruger 2009;\nVenkatapuram 2011). \nLastly, the choice of purpose affects whether one needs to make some\nof the optional specifications. For example, capabilitarian accounts\nof policy-making should explain how the different capability-sets that\ndifferent policy choices yield can be compared and traded off against\neach other. \nScholars interested in the capability approach have debated the\nquestion of whether the appropriate well-being metric should be\ncapabilities or functionings, hence opportunities or achievements.\nWhat considerations have been argued to be relevant for this\nchoice? \nThe first consideration is normative, and this is the argument Sen and\nNussbaum most often offer: by focusing on capabilities rather than\nfunctionings, we do not privilege a particular account of good lives\nbut instead aim at a range of possible ways of life from which each\nperson can choose. Thus, it is Nussbaum’s and Sen’s\ncommitment to a liberal version of the capability approach, or an\nanti-paternalist consideration, that motivates a principled choice for\ncapabilities rather than functionings. Obviously, the strength of this\nargument depends on how bad one takes paternalism to be. There may be\ngood reasons to believe that some paternalism is unavoidable, or even\ndesired (Nussbaum 2000, 51–56). To some extent, the\npromotion of functionings (rather than capabilities) may be\nunavoidable in a capabilitarian political theory, yet this tendency to\npaternalism can be stronger or weaker, depending on several specific\nchoices made in the theory (Claassen 2014). \nA second normative consideration stems from the importance given to\npersonal responsibility in contemporary political philosophy. If one\nbelieves that one should strive for equality of capability, then each\nperson should have the same real opportunity (capability), but once\nthat is in place, each individual should be held responsible for his\nor her own choices. This responsibility-sensitivity principle is\nwidely endorsed not only in political philosophy but also in the\nmathematical models being developed in normative welfare economics. If\none wants to endorse and implement this principle of\nresponsibility-sensitivity, then specifications and applications of\nthe capability approach should focus on capabilities, rather than\nfunctionings. Yet even at a highly abstract theoretical level,\nphilosophers disagree on whether we should endorse\nresponsibility-sensitivity in developing the capability approach\n(e.g., Fleurbaey 2002; Vallentyne 2005; Wolff and de-Shalit 2007).\nMoreover, for applied work, serious epistemological hurdles may\nultimately lead us to drop the responsibility-sensitive principle for\npractical reasoning about the actual world. \nThird, there are cases in which a capability is available to a person\nbut only if other people do not also want to realize that capability\n(Basu 1987: 74). For example, two spouses may each have the capability\nof holding demanding jobs which are each on their own incompatible\nwith large caring responsibilities. However, if these spouses also\nhave infants or relatives with extensive care needs, then at best only\none of them may effectively realize that capability. Since capability\nsets may therefore include freedoms that are conditional (because they\ndepend on the choices of other people), it might be better to focus\nboth on the individual’s capability set and also on what people\nhave been able to realize from their own capability sets, that is,\ntheir functionings or well-being achievements. The question of who\ndecides or should decide this sort of spousal question\nhighlights the importance of agency and procedural fairness, which are\ngenerally taken to be part of the capability approach in its broader\nuse (Crocker 2008). \nIt should also be mentioned that the concept of functioning has\nparticular relevance for our relations to those human beings who are\nnot yet able to choose (infants), who will never be able to make some\nparticular choices (severely mentally disabled individuals), or who\nhave lost this ability through advanced dementia or serious brain\ndamage. Whether or not these persons can decide to be well nourished\nand healthy, it is generally held that we (through families,\ngovernments, or other institutions) have the moral obligation to\npromote or protect their nutritional and healthy functioning. \nFinally, the choice between functionings and capabilities can also be\nbridged by a conceptual move. Sen (1987b: 36–7) has proposed the\nconcept of ‘refined functioning’ to designate functioning\nthat takes note of the available alternatives. Sen (1992: 52) notes:\n“‘fasting’ as a functioning is not just starving; it\nis choosing to starve when one does have other\noptions.” That is, one could focus on achieved functionings\nlevels but—where appropriate—include the exercise of\nchoice as one of the relevant functionings (Fleurbaey 2002; Stewart\n1995). \nIn addition to these normative and conceptual arguments, there are\nalso concerns related to the application and measurability that\ninfluence the choice of capabilities, functionings, or a combination\nof the two (Robeyns 2006). It is, for example, almost always easier to\nobserve and measure functionings than capabilities (Sen 1992:\n52–3). \nOther major points of debate in the capability literature are the\nquestions of which capabilities should be selected as relevant and who\nshould decide (or how a decision should be made) on the aggregation of\nthe various dimensions into an overall assessment (Claassen 2020). At\nthe level of ideal theories of justice, some have argued that each and\nevery capability is relevant and should count in our moral calculus\n(Carter 2014; Vallentyne 2005). Others have argued that considerations\nof justice require that we demarcate morally relevant from morally\nirrelevant and morally bad capabilities (Nussbaum 2003; Pogge 2002).\nThis demarcation could be done in various ways, and most capability\nscholars think that different answers are appropriate in different\nnormative exercises. In other words, the selection of relevant\ncapabilities would be different when the question is how to arrange a\nsociety’s basic structure, versus when the question is how to\nspend the donations Oxfam has collected, or when the normative\nquestion is how to raise one’s child. Anderson (1999) argues\nthat, for purposes of political justice, the only relevant\ncapabilities are those needed for a person to participate as a\ncitizen. Nussbaum endorses a well-defined list of capabilities, which,\nshe argues, should be enshrined in every country’s constitution\n(Nussbaum 2000, 2003, 2006). Sen has been somewhat vague in responding\nto the question of how to select and weight capabilities, yet in the\nsecondary literature it has been argued that he draws on his ideal of\nagency to argue that each group should itself select, weight, trade\noff, and sequence or otherwise aggregate capabilities as well as\nprioritize them in relation to other normative considerations, such as\nagency, efficiency, and stability (Crocker 2008). \nMoving from ideal theory to non-ideal theory and empirical\napplications makes the selection of relevant capabilities even more\ncomplicated, for other concerns such as feasibility, data\navailability, practical relevance, and even parsimony may play\nsignificant roles. Several proposals are on offer, ranging from\nsubstantive proposals with elaborate theoretical underpinnings,\nthrough several procedural methods, to the atheoretical\npractice that an investigator should simply conduct a survey in order\nto collect rich data (or use an existing survey) and let a statistical\ntechnique, such as factor analysis, “decide.” At one end\nof this spectrum is Nussbaum’s well-known list, which contains\nprescribed capabilities that are grouped together under ten\n“central human capabilities”: life; bodily health; bodily\nintegrity; senses, imagination and thought; emotions; practical\nreason; affiliation; other species; play; and control over one’s\nenvironment (Nussbaum 2006: 76–78). \nNussbaum (2000: 70–77; 2006: 78–81) justifies this list by\narguing that each of these capabilities is needed in order for a human\nlife to be “not so impoverished that it is not worthy of the\ndignity of a human being” (2000: 72). She defends these\ncapabilities as being the moral entitlements of every human being on\nearth. She formulates the list at an abstract level and advocates that\nthe translation to implementation and policies should be done at a\nlocal level, taking into account local differences. Nussbaum argues\nthat this list can be derived from a Rawlsian overlapping consensus\nand stresses that her list remains open-ended and always open for\nrevision (Nussbaum 2000: 77), yet other philosophers have taken issue\nwith her claim that this would result in a form of political\nliberalism (Barclay 2003) or have argued that this leaves insufficient\nscope for democratic deliberation and respect for agency in her\ncapability approach (e.g., Crocker 2008; Robeyns 2003; Sen 2004a,\n2004b). Yet this strand of critique has itself been criticized for not\nunderstanding the proper role of philosophy and the normative and\npolitical status of Nussbaum’s proposal (Claassen 2011). \nSen consistently and explicitly refuses to defend “one\npre-determined canonical list of capabilities, chosen by theorists\nwithout any general social discussion or public reasoning” (Sen\n2005: 158). Of course, groups and theorists might construct lists for\nvarious purposes, and lists need not be “pre-determined”\nor “canonical,” however we might understand these terms.\nAnd Sen’s refusal to endorse Nussbaum’s list has not\nprevented him from using—for various purposes—particular\nselections of capabilities in his empirical as well as his normative\nwork. However, beyond stating in general terms that some democratic\nprocess and public reasoning should be involved, Sen has never\nexplained in detail how such a selection could and should be done. Sen\n(2005) has been reluctant to specify a substantive list of\ncapabilities and functionings in order to avoid paternalism - holding\nthat communities should decide for themselves, which capabilities\nshould apply - and the imposition of a particular conception of the\ngood life. Consequently, Sen (1987b; 1992; 2002; 2009) has repeatedly\nstated that capabilities should be defined as the real freedom to\nachieve those doings and beings that we ‘have reason to\nvalue’. The ‘having reason to value’-formulation of\ncapabilities and functionings is widely regarded within the capability\nliterature as the correct, only, or most popular definition. \nOn the one hand, the ‘having reason to value’ definition\nhighlights the importance of taking into account what people\nthemselves value doing and being when evaluating their well-being.\nThis is contrary to more objective measures of well-being, such as\nutilitarianism or resourcism, which hold that people’s\nwell-being can and should be evaluated according to some objective\nmeasure, such as the amount of resources that they have or the amount\nof utility they derive from having these resources. On the other hand,\nSen’s definition also breaks with more subjective approaches to\nwell-being and the idea that people’s subjective evaluation of\ntheir well-being is all that matters. In response, Sen (1985a; 1985c;\n1987a) argues that people may be mistaken about their own well-being.\nFor example, someone might be destitute, yet evaluate their own\nsubjective well-being quite highly or value certain things, such as\nsmoking, that are actually bad for her. In order to avoid such\ncounter-intuitive conclusions, Sen invokes the notion of\nreasonableness as an objective criterion. We need to submit our values\nto a process of scrutiny and (public) reasoning and only those valued\ncapabilities that can survive this procedure can be said to be\nreasonable.  \nHowever, it has often been a matter of interpretation and contention\nwithin the capability literature what Sen means exactly with\n‘having reason to value.’ Khader and Kosko (2019) argue\nthat there are three interpretations of Sen’s ‘having\nreason to value’ definition. On the procedural autonomy\ninterpretation, an individual Y has reason to value doing or\nbeing X if Y has reasoned that X is valuable; on the process\ninterpretation, what we have reason to value is not necessarily\nwhat we do value, but rather what we\nwould value if we had gone through the proper process of\nindividual reflection (Alkire and Deneulin 2009; Bonvin and Farvaque\n2005, 282; Ibrahim and Alkire 2007; Nussbaum 2000; Sen 2002, 16) or\npublic deliberation (Alkire 2013, 91; Sen 1999, 152–153; Crocker\n2008, 270); and on the perfectionist interpretation,\nwhat people have reason to value is what is objectively valuable: Y\nsimply has reason to value X because X is valuable, even if Y does not\nherself value X (e.g., Arneson 2020). \nThe disagreement between Nussbaum and Sen on how to select\nrelevant capabilities has led many capability scholars to conclude\nthat there are only two strands of selecting capabilities, namely the\nphilosophical approach favored by Nussbaum or the procedural approach\nadvanced by Sen. However, as Byskov (2018a; 2018b, chapter 6) argues,\nthis is too simple and ignores many possible and already used methods\nfor the selection of capabilities and functionings. Byskov identifies\nat least 14 different methods for the selection of capabilities within\nthe literature, which he categorizes into ad\nhoc methods, which base their selection of capabilities on\npragmatic considerations; foundational methods, which\nselect capabilities according to some ultimate normative value or\nprinciple; procedural methods, which employ open-ended\nempirical or deliberative exercises to determine relevant\ncapabilities; and mixed (or multi-stage) methods, which\ncombine two or more foundational and/or procedural methods. \nThe theoretical debate on the selection of dimensions has been\ncomplicated by the fact that there are different views on the status\nof the selection. Is that selection a truth-claim, or should it rather\nbe seen as a contribution to democratic-decision making? Is the\nscholar proposing a selection of capabilities akin to a\nphilosopher-king, or rather to a philosopher-citizen or a\nphilosopher-mediator? Depending on how one sees these issues, it may\naffect how justified one believes a certain selection or selection\nprocedure to be (Claassen 2011, Byskov 2017). \nWhat about weighting different capabilities to come to an aggregate\nevaluation? If we have a list of relevant capabilities, we would still\nbe left with the question of whether the capabilities should be\naggregated and, if so, what their relative weights and the formula to\naggregate them will or should be. A closely related question is how\ndifferent capabilities should be traded off against one another when\nthey cannot all be realized fully. Some have argued against trade-offs\non the basis that the different capabilities are incommensurable or\nthat each capability is an absolute entitlement that never should be\noverridden by another entitlement or other normative consideration.\nFor example, Nussbaum argues that the ten capabilities on her list,\nbeing incommensurable, cannot be traded off against one another (and,\nhence, have no relative weights), and also that the state should\nprovide each citizen with a minimum threshold of each capability. \nOne possible system of weighting or aggregating is to use a democratic\nor some other social choice procedure (Chakraborty 1996). The basic\nidea would be to encourage or prescribe that the relevant group of\npeople decide on the weights. In some contexts, such as small-scale\nprojects or evaluations, such capability weighting (and selection)\ncould be done by participatory techniques. It has also been suggested\nthat we may determine the weights of capabilities as a function of how\nmuch they contribute to overall life satisfaction or happiness\n(Schokkaert 2007). Yet this raises the question to what extent\nfunctionings are taken to be merely instrumental to another end, such\nas happiness, or indeed any other ultimate good or ideal. \nMuch of the existing literature refers to the issue of\n‘weighting’, but this is only one particular form of the\nmore general ‘aggregating’, since aggregation may take a\ndifferent functional form than simply adding up. For example, if you\nhave no food, your other capabilities will be worth very little. Some\ncapabilities may thus be complementary capabilities, implying that\ntheir value to a person depends on the presence (or absence) of other\ncapabilities. (Note the similarity with the notion of\n‘complementary goods’ in consumer theory in economics,\nwhere it is argued that the utility of some goods is dependent on the\nquantity of some other goods, as in the case of pencils and erasers,\nor shoe polish and shoes of the same color). \nWhen developing a capability theory it is often necessary to specify\nwhat additional descriptive, normative, metaphysical, and/or\nmeta-theoretical commitments are made. As mentioned, the purpose of\none’s theory might determine some of the commitments that the\ntheory must adhere to, however in other cases this is not necessarily\nso. For example, while a capability theory of distributive justice -\nmore on which in\n section 4\n - is committed to conceptualizing justice primarily in terms of\nthe fair distribution of capabilities and functionings, it is an open\nquestion whether the distribution of other normative concerns, such as\nutility, happiness, or resources, should play a secondary role.\nLikewise, the choice of distributive principle is also open and one\nmay develop sufficientarian, strict egalitarian, or prioritarian\ntheories of justice, all of which are committed to the distribution of\ncapabilities and functionings, while the notion of responsibility that\nis employed may rely on different descriptive theories of human beings\nas either fully or only partially rational beings. A capability theory\nof justice may also include metaphysical commitments that extend\nrights and responsibilities to non-human animals and entities. \nThe capability approach is often wrongly taken to be an egalitarian\ntheory or a theory of social or distributive justice. This reading is\nmistaken, even though it is entirely understandable given the specific\ndebates in which the main philosophers defending the capability\napproach made their interventions. The capability approach specifies\nwhat should count for interpersonal evaluations and thus provides an\nimportant aspect of a theory of social or distributive justice, yet\nmore is needed. \nNussbaum’s work comes closest to offering us a capability theory\nof justice, but her theory too does not amount to a full theory\nof social justice. Nussbaum’s theory of social justice is\ncomprehensive, in the sense that it is not limited to an account of\npolitical justice, or to liberal democracies. Rather, her account\nholds for all human beings on earth, independently of whether they are\nliving in a liberal democratic regime, or of whether they are severely\ndisabled. The main demarcation of Nussbaum’s account is that it\nprovides only “a partial and minimal account of social\njustice” (Nussbaum 2006: 71) by specifying thresholds of a list\nof capabilities that governments in all nations should guarantee to\ntheir citizens. Nussbaum’s theory focuses on thresholds, but\nthis does not imply that reaching these thresholds is all that matters\nfor social justice; rather, her theory is partial and simply leaves\nunaddressed the question what social justice requires once those\nthresholds are met. \nNote, however, that not all capability theorists working on issues of\njustice believe that aiming for such a fully worked-out theory of\njustice is what thinking about justice requires. Sen (2006; 2008;\n2009) himself has argued at length that we don’t need a theory\nthat describes a utopian ideal, but rather we need theorising to help\nus with making comparisons of injustice, and to guide us towards a\nless unjust society. Similarly, Drydyk (2012) has argued that the\ncapability approach to justice should focus on reducing capability\nshortfalls, for which a utopian account of perfect justice is not\nneeded. Some capability theorists may want to work out a full theory\nof justice by addressing the various specifications outlined above,\nwhile others may want to change the nature of theorising about\njustice, moving it more to applied, non-ideal or grounded theories\n(Watene and Drydyk 2016). \nMoreover, it would be a mistake to think that there can be only one\ncapability theory of justice; on the contrary, the open nature of the\ncapability approach allows for the development of a family of\ncapability theories of justice, including accounts proposed by\nAnderson (1999) and Claassen (2018). But this prompts the\nquestion: what is needed to develop a full capability theory of\njustice, and which of these aspects have already been developed by\ntheorists of justice? \nFirst, a theory of justice needs to explain on what basis it justifies\nits principles or claims of justice. For example, while the early\nNussbaum (1992) justifies her list of capabilities through an analysis\nof what can be considered essential human traits, the later Nussbaum\n(2011a) holds that her list of capabilities is justified because they\npromote human dignity. Anderson (1999, 316) argues that people should\nbe entitled “to whatever capabilities are necessary to enable\nthem to avoid or escape entanglement in oppressive social\nrelationships” and “to the capabilities necessary for\nfunctioning as an equal citizen in a democratic state.” Claassen\n(2017, 2018) argues that the capabilities relevant for social justice\ncan be derived from society’s ultimate concern with navigational\nagency. \nSecond, as indicated above, in developing a capability theory of\njustice we must decide whether we want it to be an outcome or an\nopportunity theory, that is, whether we think that we should assess\ninjustices in terms of functionings, or rather in terms of\ncapabilities, or a mixture. At the level of theory and principles,\nmost theorists of justice endorse the view that justice is done if all\nhave equal genuine opportunities, or if all reach a minimal threshold\nof capability levels. Translated to the capability language, this\nwould imply that at the level of theory and principles, capabilities\nare the relevant metric of justice, and not functionings. However, not\neveryone subscribes to this view. Phillips (2004) has been a prominent\nvoice arguing for equality of outcome, rather than opportunities. In\nthe capability literature, Fleurbaey (2002) has argued against the\nview to take only capabilities into account and has defended a focus\non ‘refined functionings’ (being the combination of\nfunctionings and capabilities). \nThird, a capability theory of justice will need, just as all other\ntheories that are derived from the general and underspecified\ncapability approach, to address the issue of selecting, quantifying\nand aggregating of dimensions. For the case of theories of justice,\nthe problem of selecting, quantifying and aggregating turns into the\nquestion: ‘in which dimensions should we evaluate justice, how\nshould we construct metrics in these dimensions, and how should we\naggregate all the dimensions for overall assessments of\njustice?’ The general challenge of selecting and aggregating\nwhich was discussed above therefore also applies here. \nFourth, a capability theory of justice may need to address other\n‘metrics of justice’. Within theories of justice, one\nstrand of debate has been between those defending capabilities and\nfunctionings, on the one hand, and those defending Dworkian resources\n(see Dworkin 2000, 299–303; Kaufman 2006b, 125–128; Pierik\nand Robeyns 2007; Sen 1985b; 2009, 264–268; Williams 2002).\nFunctionings and capabilities have also been proposed by capability\nphilosophers as an alternative for, and improvement on, the Rawlsian\nsocial primary goods metric, which focuses on general purpose goods,\nsuch as income and wealth, opportunities and liberties, and the social\nbasis of self-respect (Rawls 1971). Sen argues that a focus on primary\ngoods is inherently inflexible as a metric of justice: “the\nprimary goods approach seems to take little note of the diversity of\nhuman beings. … If people were basically very similar, then an\nindex of primary goods might be quite a good way of judging advantage.\nBut, in fact, people seem to have very different needs varying with\nhealth, longevity, climatic conditions, location, work conditions,\ntemperament, and even body size. … So what is being involved is\nnot merely ignoring a few hard cases, but overlooking very widespread\nand real differences” (Sen 1979a: 215–216), such as in the\ncase of the disabled person who would not have a claim to additional\nresources grounded in his impairment under Rawls’s two\nprinciples of justice. Sen argues that Rawls’s difference\nprinciple would not justify any redistribution to the disabled on\ngrounds of disability. \nYet while capability scholars initially seemed rather sure of their\ncase against Rawls (Sen 1979a, Nussbaum 2006), a more recent wave of\nphilosophical enquiry has highlighted how complicated the comparisons\nbetween Rawls’s theory of justice and the capability view are\n(Pogge 2002, Robeyns 2009, Brighouse and Robeyns 2010). One\nreason is that the capability metric is a general metric of well-being\nand well-being freedom, whereas the social primary goods metric\nemerges as one element of an integral and complex theory of political\njustice (rather than social justice more broadly, let alone the even\nwider category of moral evaluations). As Arneson (2010) rightly notes,\nthe unit of assessment ideally should be the moral theory, and not\nmerely one part of it, such as the metric of interpersonal comparison.\nAlso, Rawls’s theory of justice is an ideal theory of\njustice, in contrast to the capability approach. This means that it is\nvery hard to compare Rawls’s work on justice with the\nphilosophical work on the capability approach, since their scope and\ntheoretical aims are not the same. Moreover, Rawlsians have criticized\nthe capability approach too, and not all of their critiques have been\nsufficiently rebutted (Freeman 2006; Kelly 2010; Pogge 2002,\nRichardson 2006). \nFifth, a capability theory of justice needs to take a position on the\n‘distributive rule’ (Anderson 2010: 81) that it will\nendorse: will it argue for plain equality, or for sufficiency, or for\nprioritarianism, or for some other (mixed) distributive rule? Both\nNussbaum’s (2006) and Andersons’s (1999; 2010) theories\nare sufficiency accounts, but from this it does not follow, as\none sometimes reads in the secondary literature, that the capability\napproach entails a sufficiency rule. Sen may have given the (wrong)\nimpression of defending straight equality as a distributive rule, by\nasking the question ‘Equality of what?’ (Sen 1979a),\nthough a careful reading shows that he was merely asking the question\n‘If we want to be defending equality of something, then\nwhat would that be?’ In fact, Sen has remained uncommitted to\none single distributive rule, which probably can be explained by the\nfact that he is averse of building a well-defined theory of justice\nbut rather prefers to investigate how real-life unjust situations can\nbe turned into more just situations, even if perfect justice is\nunattainable (Sen 2009). The capability approach clearly plays a role\nin Sen’s work on justice, since when assessing a situation he\nwill investigate inequalities in people’s capabilities and\nanalyze the processes that led to those inequalities.  \nSixth, a capability theory of justice needs to specify where the line\nbetween individual and collective responsibility is drawn, or how it\nwill be decided, and by whom, where this line will be drawn. There is\na remarkable absence of any discussion about issues of responsibility\nin the capability literature. In part this might be explained by the\nfact that much of the work on capabilities deals with global poverty,\nwhere issues of individual responsibility seem to be less relevant\nsince it would seem outrageous to suggest that the world’s most\ndestitute people are personally responsible for the situation they are\nin. That doesn’t mean that the responsibility question is not\nimportant: it is indeed of utmost importance to ask who is responsible\nfor global poverty reduction or the fulfilling of the Millenium\nDevelopment Goals, on which political philosophers have written a\ngreat deal (e.g., Pogge 2008, Singer 2009). The point is rather that\nphilosophical puzzles, such as the issues of expensive tastes (for\nexpensive wine, caviar, fast cars, or you name it), are simply beyond\nthe radar screen of the child laborer or the poor peasant. \nThis brings us to a related issue: a theory of justice generally\nspecifies not only rights, but also duties. However, capability\ntheorists have remained largely silent on the questions of who should\nbear the duties for the expansion of the selected capabilities.\nNussbaum passionately advocates that all people all over the world\nshould be entitled, as a matter of justice, to threshold levels of all\nthe capabilities on her list; but apart from mentioning that it is the\ngovernments’ duties to guarantee these entitlements (2006: 70),\nshe remains silent on the question who precisely should bear the\nburdens and responsibilities for realizing these capabilities. Yet as\nOnora O’Neill (1996: chapter 5) has argued, questions of\nobligations and responsibilities should be central to any account of\njustice. \nThis section makes clear that a capability theory of justice is\ntheoretically much more demanding than the basic presupposition of the\ncapability approach that ‘functionings’ and\n‘capabilities’ are the best metric for most kinds of\ninterpersonal evaluations. While much has been written on the\ncapability approach in recent years, by an increasing number of\nscholars, including philosophers, much of the philosophical work\nneeded for turning the open-ended capability approach into a specific\ntheory of justice remains to be done. \nWhile most of the philosophical contributions to the literature has\ntended to take place within the Western philosophical tradition\n(Nussbaum 2020, section 1.1) — however one defines this\ntradition — some more recent literature has begun to explore how\nnon-Western philosophies, such as Maori philosophy, Ubuntu, and Buen\nVivir, can contribute to the development of the capability approach\nand vice versa (Bockstael and Watene 2016). \nSome of this literature employs the capability approach to\nconceptualize the rights of Indigenous peoples. Panzironi (2012), for\nexample, introduces the notion of ‘Indigenous capability\nrights,’ while Murphy (2014) argues that Indigenous\nself-determination can be conceptualized as a collective capability.\nSimilarly, Binder and Binder (2016) argue that the recognition\nthat the value of capabilities is culture- and context-specific,\nwithin (at least Sen’s version of) the capability approach, can\nhelp ground Indigenous rights to autonomous self-governance and\nself-determination. \nAnother part of this literature aims to show how Indigenous\nphilosophies and concepts can help particular applications of the\ncapability approach, in particular in relation to sustainable human\ndevelopment and environmental justice. Schlosberg and Carruthers\n(2010) argue that environmental justice for Indigenous peoples must\ninclude a concern for developing their capabilities. Watene (2016)\nargues that the capability approach in its present form is unable to\ncapture the physical and spiritual relation to nature that many\nIndigenous peoples, in particular the Maori, have. As a possible\nsolution, Watene and Yap (2015) show how Indigenous values and\nworldviews, such as a holistic relationship to nature, can contribute\nto develop notions of sustainable development. The notion of\ninterconnectedness — between human individuals and between\nhumans and nature — is also prominent in work that relates the\ncapability approach to the African philosophy of Ubuntu (Hoffmann and\nMetz 2017; Metz 2016) and that it can even be seen as an\n‘architectonic capability,’ which highlights the\ninterdependency of capabilities. \nHowever, given the panoply of non-Western philosophies, more research\nis needed to explore the capability approach in relation to, for\nexample, Chinese and Buddhist philosophy (see though Nussbaum 2020,\nsection 1.2). Argenton and Rossi (2013), however, questions whether\nthe commitment to scrutiny, reasoning, and deliberation of values\nwithin most philosophical applications of the capability approach does\nnot, in fact, run contrary to the ambition of representing the\nplurality and context-specificity of values that individuals have\nbecause this commitment relies on a substantively\nliberal understanding of what it means to be a reasonable and\ndeliberative agent found in the Western philosophical tradition. \nAs mentioned, most of the philosophical capability literature takes\nplace within the practical strand of philosophy with the aim of\naddressing real-life issues. For readers interested in how the\ncapability approach is applied to particular sub-branches of\nphilosophy, this section provides a short overview of some of the most\nprominent contributions. This overview does not aim at completeness,\nbut rather wants to give a sense of the wide range of practical\nconcerns to which the capability approach is applied. \nOne of the most prominent contributions of the capability approach is\nto the field of development ethics (Drydyk and Keleher 2018). Most\nimportantly, the capability approach has been central to the\ndevelopment of the notion of human development (Fukuda-Parr 2002;\n2003; 2011a; 2011b; Fukuda-Parr and Kumar 2003) and the\nmulti-dimensional measures used to evaluate countries’\ndevelopment levels in the annual Human Development Reports (ul Haq\n2003). Scholars who apply the capability approach to development have\ntended to highlight the necessity of taking into account issues of\nfreedom (Sen 1999), agency (Crocker 2008; Keleher and Kosko 2019),\nempowerment (Drydyk 2013), and self-determination (Binder and Binder\n2016; Byskov 2018b; Murphy 2014). \nAnother influential application of the capability approach has been\nwithin the field of public health ethics and health justice. Both Prah\nRuger (2009) and Venkatapuram (2011) have articulated comprehensive\ntheories of health justice, the latter of which has influenced the\nwork of the World Health Organization. Nielsen (2015) provides an\nargument for why capability theorists should care about health, namely\nbecause of its constitutive role in human well-being and agency.\nByskov (2019) argues that the capability approach requires a\nqualitative rather than quantitative interpretation of the principle\nof the least restrictive means, which is central to public health\nethics (Beauchamp and Childress 2001). Applied to healthcare ethics,\nEntwistle and Watt (2013a; 2013b) argue that a capability approach\nrequires the adoption of person-centred care, while Millar (2013)\nargues that the capability approach can be used to evaluate the\njustice of infectious disease control measures within healthcare\ninstitutions. The capability approach has also been widely adopted by\nphilosophers as a framework to analyze aspects of the ethics and\nphilosophy of disability (Harnacke 2013; Nussbaum 2006; Riddle 2013;\n2014; Terzi 2010; Wynne Bannister and Venkatapuram 2020). \nThe capability approach has also been applied to a wide variety of\naspects of environmental ethics and climate justice. Several edited\ncollections have focused on the concept of sustainable development\nfrom a capability perspective, also linking to questions of global and\nintergenerational justice (Gutwald et al. 2014; Lessmann and\nRauschmayer 2014). Holland (2008a; 2008b; 2014a; 2014b) argues that\nenvironmental justice entails limits to the kinds of capabilities that\npeople can choose to realize. Schlosberg and Carruthers (2010;\nSchlosberg 2012) argue that environmental justice must include a\nconcern for developing capabilities, an argument which Kronlid (2014)\nextends to climate adaptation planning. Voget-Kleschin (2013; 2015)\nuses the capability approach to investigate reasons for ecologically\nsustainable consumption patterns and lifestyles while Kramm (2020)\nshows that the capability approach can be used to conceptualize the\nwell-being of a river, which is needed in order to ground claims to\nlegal personhood for rivers, such as the Whanganui River in New\nZealand. \nThe capability approach has also been influential in developing the\nright to education and educational justice (Walker and Unterhalter\n2007). Most prominently, Walker (2003; 2006) and Unterhalter (2005;\n2007; 2013) have been at the forefront of conceptualizing social\njustice within education, while Terzi (2008) argues that social\njustice and equality in education require particular attention to\nspecial educational needs and disability. A related literature has\ncontributed to the conceptualization of childrens’ rights and\ndevelopment (Brando and Schweiger 2019; Ferracioli and Terlazzo 2014;\nHart and Brando 2018). \nThe potential applications of the capability approach are wide-ranging\nand possible areas where nascent research has begun, or more research\nis needed, include the philosophy of technology and the ethical\naspects of artificial intelligence and surveillance (Oosterlaken 2011;\n2015); business ethics and corporate social responsibility (Bertland\n2009; Giovanola 2009; Sferrazzo and Ruffini forthcoming); animal ethics and\nthe rights of of non-human animals (Bendik-Keymer 2014; Cripps 2010;\nNussbaum 2011b; Palmer 2010); and professional ethics and the rights\nof employees.","contact.mail":"morten.byskov@warwick.ac.uk","contact.domain":"warwick.ac.uk"}]
