While the influence of the Zen\ntradition on Japanese thought and culture is widely acknowledged, the\nrole of Pure Land Buddhist concepts and sensibilities have tended to\nreceive only marginal recognition in the West; nevertheless, it is\nimpossible to ignore their perhaps even more pervasive force. Moreover,\nas D. T. Suzuki (1870–1966) has noted, \n\n\nThe Japanese may not have\noffered very many original ideas to world thought or world culture, but\nin Shin we find a major contribution the Japanese can make to the\noutside world and to all other Buddhist\n schools. (Suzuki 1970, pp. 13–14)\n\n\nAlthough Suzuki does not define what ideas he\nhas in mind, he indicates that it is specifically in relation to the\nPure Land tradition that we find a significant, innovative development\nin Buddhist philosophy that has taken place in Japan.\n\n\n\n In brief, the\nJapanese Pure Land contribution to Buddhist philosophy may be said to\nlie in its fusion of two fundamental attitudes. On the one hand, it\nstands squarely upon a Mahayana Buddhist conception of enlightened\nwisdom as radically nondichotomous and nondual with reality, indicated\nwith such terms as thusness, buddha-nature, and emptiness. On the other\nhand, it directly confronts the nature of human existence in its\nineluctable finitude: karmically conditioned, discriminative and\nreifying in awareness, and given to the afflicting passions of\nattachment to a falsely conceived self surrounded by substantial\nobjects. Through its probing religious anthropology, Japanese Pure Land\nthought explores the paradoxical issues of how transformative awakening\ncan be possible for the ignorant self, how attainment as liberation\nfrom defiled self-will can occur, and the nature of the world of\nreligious realization that unfolds within the locus of a person’s\nsamsaric existence.\n\n\n Before proceeding\nto a consideration of Japanese Pure Land Buddhist thought, it may be\nuseful to note two intertwined difficulties that it presents for modern\nWestern readers in particular: an extensive scriptural and commentarial\ntradition, and apparent resemblances to familiar forms of Christian\nthought. \n The Pure Land\nteachings are often regarded as popularized, devotional extensions of a\nmore philosophically demanding contemplative tradition based on a core\ndoctrine of emptiness or voidness. In fact, the concepts of multitudes\nof celestial buddhas and their buddha-fields throughout the cosmos are\nalready in evidence in the earliest strata of extant texts produced by\nthe Mahayana movement, and sutras expounding distant buddha-fields,\nsuch as that of Akṣobhya Buddha in the east, are among the first\nto be translated into Chinese already in the second century CE, with\nsutras teaching Amida Buddha soon to follow. Thus, sutras teaching\nmethods of achieving liberation from samsaric existence through\nattaining birth in buddha-fields in other regions of the\ncosmos—particularly Amida Buddha’s Pure Land—were\namong the earliest Buddhist scriptures transmitted to China. Further,\nthe teaching of birth into Amida’s buddha-field became the focus\nof a continuous commentarial tradition that began among such major\nIndian Mahayana thinkers as Nāgārjuna (c. 150–250) and\nVasubandhu (c. 320–400) in India, was transmitted to China as early as\nthe third century CE, and is maintained today in Japan. Thus, it may be\nsaid that Pure Land concepts and ideas emerged directly out of\nelemental strains of Mahayana Buddhist thought at an early stage and\nunderwent continual development in East Asia. \n\n The Pure Land path\nbased on Amida is expounded in the Larger and Smaller\nSutras of the Adornments of [the Buddha-field Named]\nBliss (Sukhāvatīvyūha-sūtra),\nwhich trace their origins back to northwestern India in about the first\ncentury CE, the period of the redaction of the\nPrajñāpāramitā in 8000 Lines,\nGarland, Lotus, Vimalakīrti, and other\nmajor Mahayana sutras. These two sutras, along with the later Sutra\nof Contemplation on the Buddha of Immeasurable Life (Jp.\nKanmuryōjukyō), form the foundation for the East\nAsian Pure Land tradition. \n\n The Larger Sutra\nis the only extant sutra that relates the narrative of how the\nbodhisattva Dharma-Storehouse (Dharmākara) established and\nfulfilled vows to become Amida (“immeasurable [light and\nlife]”), the buddha of compassion who leads all beings to\nenlightenment by enabling them to be born into his buddha-field. It was\nfirst translated into Chinese in the third century and was reputedly\nretranslated eleven more times over the following seven hundred years,\nattesting to its enduring importance in Chinese Buddhist tradition. The\nPure Land tradition developed for over a thousand years in China,\naccumulating an extensive body of scriptural and commentarial writings,\nbefore undergoing the radical reinterpretation in Japan that Suzuki\nrefers to. \n\n Thus, the Pure Land\nBuddhist heritage in Japan stands today upon the selective use of a\ncontinuous textual tradition stretching back nearly two millennia.\nTerms from the Chinese of the sutras in their various renditions and\nevolving commentaries on the Pure Land path became the standard medium\nof Pure Land Buddhist discourse in Japan, so that a full grasp of the\nJapanese tradition requires familiarity with these terms, their\nrelationship to the broader Buddhist tradition, and the historical\nchanges in their understandings and emphases in the course of their\nlong development in various cultural spheres and sectarian settings.\nJapanese Buddhists have been, throughout their history, fully aware of\ntheir geographical position at the easternmost reach of the spread of\nBuddhism in Asia and of their indebtedness to the transmission of\nBuddhist tradition across the various ethnic locales and political\nboundaries of the Asian continent. \n A further\ndifficulty in grasping Japanese Pure Land thought involves the pitfalls\nof a comparative approach in relation to Western religious traditions.\nWhen, for his own polemical purposes, Karl Barth (1886–1968) surveyed\nthe religious traditions of the world in search of doctrinal parallels\nto Christianity, he concluded that it was the Japanese Pure Land\ntradition that provided\n “the most exact, comprehensive, and plausible ‘pagan’ parallel to\n Christianity” (Barth 1961, 1,2: 342).\nHe expresses some shock at the depth\nand specificity of resemblance, commenting that the Pure Land thought\nof Hōnen (1133–1212) and Shinran (1173–1263) in particular \nparallels not so much Roman or Greek Catholicism but rather of\nall things the Christianity of the Reformation, and therefore\nconfronts Christianity with the question of its truth precisely in its\n form as a consistent religion of grace. (Barth 1961, 1,2: 342; for a discussion on\nBarth’s comparative comments, see Hirota 2000a, especially pp. 35–38) \nBarth insightfully discusses specific doctrinal\nanalogues in a long note in Church Dogmatics, and these\nparallels have indeed tended to form the foundations for the\nunderstanding of Japanese Pure Land Buddhism in much of Western\nscholarly literature. Unfortunately, to the extent that Pure Land\nBuddhism has seemed to resemble Protestant Christianity, it has also\nbeen assumed to be divorced from “genuine” or\n“original” Mahayana Buddhist thought and practices and\ndevoid of any intellectual interest. Any comparative considerations of\nJapanese Pure Land Buddhist thought, therefore, require caution, even\nin the face of seemingly evident resemblance. \n\n As mentioned\nbefore, the Pure Land Buddhist teachings have taken on a highly\ndistinctive shape in Japan, generating new determinations of the central canonical texts and\nmultiple strands of scholastic and commentarial tradition. It is in\nrelation to these latter developments that we can best speak of a\nspecifically “Japanese Pure Land Buddhist philosophy,” for\nthe creative construals of a practicable Buddhist path to transformed\nawareness involved, in the forces for their evolution and in the\narticulation of their implications, deliberation on such matters as the\nnature of human existence, self and other, language, reality, and\ntruth. Further, the disparate streams of Japanese Pure Land thought\nstand as distinctive understandings, often employing their own\ncharacteristic terminology, of an already highly evolved Buddhist\ntradition, and a grasp of them often requires a recognition of the\ntensions between received tradition and reinterpretation that they\nmanifest. \n\n In order to treat Pure Land Buddhist tradition while keeping within\nthe parameters of “Japan” and “philosophy,”\nthis entry will divide the discussion into three sections. In the\nfirst, there is a brief sketch of several broad trajectories of\nthought that stem from central Mahayana concerns and that shape the\nPure Land outlook, coming to hold particular significance in the\nJapanese Pure Land tradition. The second section identifies the\ncentral issues involved in Hōnen’s seminal reformulation of the\nPure Land path. The third section will then treat several fundamental\nphilosophical issues in Japanese Pure Land thought, focusing upon Pure\nLand thought as one distinctive stream of a path to religious\nawakening within the Mahayana traditions of praxis, and further upon\nthe major developments that occurred specifically in Japan. The point\nwill not be to suggest that medieval Japanese thinkers speak directly\nto Western philosophical issues, but rather to investigate how their\nthinking might be understood to take up topics commonly considered\nphilosophical in Western intellectual tradition and to illuminate\nperspectives relevant to current intellectual concerns. \n\n Two fundamental\nelements of early Mahayana practice contributed significantly to the\ndevelopment of the Pure Land path. First, the animating force that\ninitially gave rise to the Mahayana movement as a whole—the\ncritical reflection on obdurate self-attachment that attended even\nreligious endeavor—was pursued to a culmination in Pure Land\naspiration. Second, the Mahayana movement’s formulation of\ngenuine practice as the career of the bodhisattva-practitioner provided\nthe principal framework and symbols for the articulation of Pure Land\npractice. In particular, the stage in the bodhisattva’s progress\nof nonretrogression from perfect enlightenment, which was regarded as\nholding decisive significance, served to shape the Pure Land path by\nbecoming its goal. \n\n Mahayana tradition\nappears to have arisen when, around the beginning of the common era,\ngroups of Buddhists emerged who, reflecting on their own experience in\npractice, assumed a critical stance toward the immediately preceding\ntradition. They viewed the existing institutions as having declined,\nduring five centuries of transmission since the time of the Buddha,\ninto monastic formalism and scholasticism, sectarian disputation, and\nan erroneous notion of the nature of the wisdom that was the aim of\nBuddhist practice. They declared that the established view of training,\ndirected to merely personal emancipation from painful existence, was\nnarrow and finally inadequate, and that in their aspiration to attain\nthe actual realization Śākyamuni had transmitted, they had\nsought and discovered a method by which genuine attainment was\npossible. They called this new path the “great vehicle”\n(Mahayana), because it holds as its goal the attainment of authentic\nenlightenment by all beings, and asserted that it was superior to the\nexisting institutions, which they labeled the “lesser\nvehicle” (Hinayana). \n\n According to\nMahayanists, the Hinayana sages withdrew from ordinary life in society\nand performed practices and disciplines, seeking their own extinction\nof passions and emancipation from samsaric existence by realizing the\nnonsubstantiality of their own person—the fact that the ego-self\nis no more than a delusional construct. Mahayana Buddhists asserted\nthat such praxis did not free practitioners from a final residue of\nself-attachment manifested in the desertion of the beings of samsara in\nfavor of personal liberation and in an attachment to the goal of\nnirvana itself. Instead, the Mahayanists taught the thorough\nrelinquishment of all attachments through the realization or\n“seeing” of the nonsubstantiality or emptiness that\npervades not only the self, but all things and all persons. Such seeing\nis established by eradicating the discriminative thinking arising from\nthe perspective of the reified, delusional self. One thus transcends\neven the dichotomies of self and other, blind passions and\nenlightenment, and samsara and nirvana, and realizes nondiscriminative\nwisdom that “sees suchness” or things just as they are.\nHere, practice to attain enlightenment oneself and to liberate all\nbeings is understood to be one. \n\n The rigorous\nscrutiny of even religious praxis for vestiges of self-attachment and\ndiscriminative thinking, which informed the origins of the Mahayana\nmovement, also provided impetus for its development as the Pure Land\npath. \n\nThe path of realization based on the Mahayana conception of genuine\nwisdom was elaborated as the career of the bodhisattva. As described in\nMahayana sutras, it begins with the profound awakening of the mind\naspiring for enlightenment (bodhicitta), the determination to\nbecome a buddha whatever hardships one may encounter over the course of\nmany lifetimes of endeavor. This unshakable resolution is declared in\nthe presence of a buddha in formal vows, and typically, the bodhisattva\nreceives from the buddha a prophesy foretelling eventual fulfillment of\nthose vows. A standard element of such individual vows is the\nestablishment, through their vast accumulation of merit through praxis,\nof a buddha land or field of influence (buddhakṣetra),\nwhich is understood as giving concrete manifestation both to the\nsplendor of their attainment and to their activity to bring beings to\nenlightenment. \n\nThe bodhisattva then embarks upon the practices and disciplines, to\nbe continued through countless lifetimes, that will finally result in\nfulfillment. It is said that vast aeons—“three great\ninnumerable kalpas”—are required for the completion of a\nbodhisattva’s practices (the inconceivable stretches of time may\nbe understood as expressing the depths of a being’s evil karma to\nbe eradicated and the preciousness of enlightenment). The process of\npractice has been formulated in a scheme of ten stages, in which the\nmost crucial is the stage of nonretrogression, the first (or in some\nformats, the seventh). While prior to reaching this stage, they will\nfall back into samsaric existence if they discontinue their practice,\nonce they have attained nonretrogression through stilling their\ndiscriminative thought and seeing suchness, they will never regress but\nsteadily advance in their practice to supreme awakening. \n\nAlthough Pure Land Buddhism is sometimes understood to teach a\nparadisial afterlife, in fact it developed as a method for achieving\nnonretrogression, one that provided an alternative to the arduous\nendeavor through numerous lifetimes required for reaching this stage in\nthe earlier formulations of the bodhisattva path. As practitioners\nfound themselves without enlightened guidance in a world increasingly\ndistant from the benign influence of a buddha’s presence, the\nobstacles to successful practice loomed ever larger and practitioners\ncame to seek a practicable way to advance. The possibility of entrance\ninto an environment that would support one’s efforts in\nbodhisattva practices emerged, and on the basis of the Pure Land\nsutras, the concepts of the bodhisattva path were recast to render a\nnew understanding of the nature of practice. \n\nThere are several aspects of the bodhisattva’s career of\nparticular note when approaching Pure Land Buddhist thought. First, an\nessential element of the bodhisattva path is the transference to other\nbeings of the merit that accrues from performance of praxis. All\nBuddhists have accepted that, by the principle of karmic causation,\ngood acts hold the power to counteract the effects of evil deeds and\nlead to better conditions in the next birth. In the earlier Buddhism,\nit was generally assumed that only one’s own thoughts and acts\ncould exert their influence on one’s future conditions, although\nthe evidence of inscriptions suggests that sharing merit with\none’s parents or teacher was also recognized. In the Mahayana\ntradition, however, bodhisattvas perform good acts and practices for\nlong aeons and thus accumulate vast stores of merit, but their practice\nis invariably undertaken with the liberation of all beings foremost in\ntheir minds. Thus, their merit is always freely and selflessly given to\nbeings in samsaric existence. This concept of giving or transferring\nmerit (Jp. ekō) is a direct expression of the nature of\nbodhisattvas, for they undertake their practice in nondichotomous\nwisdom. \n\n Even in the early\nBuddhist tradition, Sakyamuni’s attainment of awakening was not\nregarded as an utterly unique event or even the first occurrence of\nbuddhahood. Nevertheless, the appearance of a buddha, who bears the\nepochal role of bringing liberation to beings through teaching, was\nregarded as a momentous event in the history of the world. The early\ntradition had taught instead the ideal of the arhat, who would enter\ninto nirvana upon death, having completely eradicated blind passions\nand attained emancipation from further rebirth within the world of\nsamsaric existence. \n\nThe Mahayana tradition, however, recognized the attainment of\nbuddhahood itself—not merely deliverance from afflicting passions\nand samsaric existence—as the genuine goal of religious practice\nand proclaimed it, along with the engagement with beings in samsara\nthat it implied, as the supreme fulfillment for all sentient beings\nsince the beginningless past. It is natural, therefore, that Mahayana\nBuddhists recognize the present existence of vast numbers of celestial\nbuddhas and bodhisattvas who had already reached attainment. \n\nFurther, it was assumed in Indian Buddhism that two buddhas could\nnot appear in a single epoch of a world system, any more than two\n“universal monarchs” (cakravartin) could rule\nsimultaneously. Thus, the existence of innumerable buddhas implied that\nthere are myriads of purified buddha-fields over which they preside,\nfor it may be expected that, through aeons of history in numberless\nworlds, countless beings will have attained supreme awakening by\nfollowing the bodhisattva path, and these beings all work for the\nliberation of others in their own spheres of realization. Mahayana\nwritings often refer to the concept of the “great\nchiliocosm,” which is made up of one billion universes. In the\nMahayana cosmology, there are great chiliocosms countless as the sands\nof the Ganges throughout the ten quarters, and most are buddha-fields,\nor parts of buddha-fields, in which a buddha teaches dharma for the\nbenefit of its inhabitants. Our own universe—called the Sahā\nworld, or “world in which pain must be endured”—is\nthe buddha-field of Sakyamuni, the sphere in which he appeared in order\nto save the beings within it. Thus, the entire cosmos is a panoply of\ncountless buddha-fields in which the drama of the salvation of all\nbeings is carried out, with buddhas and bodhisattvas radiating the\nlight of wisdom-compassion for all living things. \n\nA third aspect of notable relevance to the Pure Land tradition is\nthe transcendence of the dichotomy of monastic and lay in Mahayana\nthought. Monastic life had developed as the practical norm for Buddhist\nlife in the early tradition, for the end was personal emancipation from\nsamsaric existence. Practice was construed as observance of the\nmonastic code and meditative practices, and withdrawal from ordinary\nlay life was itself seen as a crucial step in breaking the bonds of\nsamsaric existence. Mahayanists, however, sought to realize a fully\nnondichotomous wisdom; hence, while in actual practice they continued\nto recognize the efficacy of monastic life as a means to the goal,\nrenunciation of lay life was not in itself an intrinsic or requisite\naspect of emancipation. They therefore reformulated the central\nelements of the path—traditionally given as the “three\nlearnings” of precepts, meditation, and wisdom—as the six\nparamitas—giving, moral action, patience, effort, meditation, and\nwisdom. In this enumeration of virtues, we find selfless giving\nunderstood not simply as alms-giving or “charity,” but as\nthe total, compassionate activity of bodhisattvas for whom meritorious\naction leading to enlightenment and the giving of their own merit to\nothers are interfused. Other paramitas also emphasize the resolution to\nfulfill the bodhisattva vows for the enlightenment of all beings.\nMoreover, precepts or morality was not necessarily construed as the\nrigid monastic rule governing sequestered life apart from normal\nsociety, but as a more general code of proper action observable in\nvarying degrees in lay life also. Thus, true practice and attainment\ntranscends the dualism of monk and lay, and the arena of the\nbodhisattva’s practice is precisely the realm of samsara in which\nunenlightened beings wander. This insight rooted in Mahayana thought\nfrom its beginnings underlies the evolution of Pure Land Buddhism in\nJapan in particular, which during the period of its most dynamic\ndevelopment evinces precisely the shift of the center of praxis from\nassumptions of monastic efficacy to an emphasis on everyday life as the\ndomain of in which genuine practice is manifested. \n\n Since our\nfundamental concern is with characteristically Japanese developments of\nPure Land thought, I will focus in particular on the stream of\nHōnen. It was Hōnen who achieved perhaps the radical\ndoctrinal innovation of his seminal period in Japanese Buddhist history\nby establishing the practice of vocal nembutsu as an independent,\nself-sufficient path of Buddhist praxis. Despite widespread esteem for\nhis priestly and scholarly attainments and the purity of his religious\naspirations, Hōnen himself, in his penetrating self-reflection,\nexpressed a profound awareness of his incapacity to fulfill any\nBuddhist practice and thereby advance himself toward enlightenment. He\ntherefore searched throughout Buddhist tradition for an accessible\npath, and at length found the exposition of the nembutsu. \n\n Nembutsu practices\nin early Buddhist tradition centered on mindfulness exercises conducted\nin veneration of Sakyamuni Buddha, and included elements of bodily\nworship and the reverent repetition of the name of the Buddha. Later,\nit developed into a core practice of monastics involving ritual\nprostrations with the body, contemplation on the features of\nenlightened beings and vocal recitation of their names, conducted with\nlong lists of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Such nembutsu practice was and\nremains a basic practice in the Tendai monastery of Enryaku-ji on Mount\nHiei, where Hōnen originally trained and lived. In addition, the\nChinese Tientai practice of “constant walking samadhi”\n(jōgyō zammai), in which a monk circumambulates a\nlarge statue of Amida, intoning the nembutsu and meditating on Amida\nBuddha and features of the Pure Land continuously for ninety days, had\nbeen transmitted to Mount Hiei during the Heian period, and the group\npractice of “constant nembutsu” (fudan nembutsu)\nin which the nembutsu was chanted continuously for a set number of\ndays—three or seven—interspersed with the chanting of sutra\npassages and hymns at the “six hours” of the day, was\nfrequently conducted. Although deeply familiar with such comprehensive\nmodes of practice embracing physical, mental, and verbal discipline,\nand although widely revered for his own contemplative and scholarly\nattainments, Hōnen taught that simply uttering the Name of Amida\nBuddha, “Namu-amida-butsu,” entrusting oneself to his vow\nto save all beings, results in birth into Amida’s buddha-field of\nenlightened activity. No intellectual command of Buddhist teachings,\naccumulation of merit, moral rectitude, or any act of practice other\nthan the vocal nembutsu is necessary. \n\n The Pure Land\nBuddhist path based on the working of Amida’s Vow is therefore an\neffective means toward emancipation from birth-and-death and attainment\nof Buddhahood—for Hōnen, the only viable way for people at\npresent—and it can be practiced independently of any other\nBuddhist teaching or method of praxis. While traditionally the nembutsu\npractice involved mental concentration and the accumulation of numerous\nrecitations, Hōnen taught that in the Pure Land path only the\nsimple saying of “Namu-amida-butsu” with complete trust was\ninvolved. There was no specified manner of utterance, no necessity for\nany accompanying ritual or meditative endeavor, and no stipulation of\nthe length of the period of practice or number of repetitions. \n\n The question, of\ncourse, is why mere vocalization of Amida’s Name should hold the\npower to bring about birth into a buddha-field and eventual\nenlightenment, which in our present condition are virtually impossible\nto accomplish, even through the achievement of extensive learning, deep\nmeditative states, heroic discipline, and compassionate action. Without\nan adequate demonstration that vocal nembutsu held such power, Pure\nLand praxis would remain an supplementary discipline within the\nexisting schools of Buddhist tradition, one supportive practice to be\nperformed in combination with a range of other methods. \n\n Hōnen\npromulgated his teaching by adopting an innovative perspective on the\nnature of the practices taught in Buddhist tradition. He reasoned that,\nalthough the utterance of the Buddha’s name had long been\ntransmitted in various Buddhist schools as one among countless\ndifferent kinds of practice useful for attainment of enlightenment, the\nvocal nembutsu designated in Amida’s vow as the act leading to\nbirth into the Pure Land was qualitatively distinct from every one of\nthe thousands of other techniques found in the Buddhist teachings.\nWhile the physical act of voicing the Name of Amida in itself might be\nidentical, in other forms of Buddhism it was performed in conjunction\nwith various other practices, including the awakening of the aspiration\nfor enlightenment (bodhicitta) and the selfless transference\nof merits, and like other practices, its fulfillment as praxis\ngenuinely leading toward Buddhahood turned on the practitioner’s\nown purity of motive and powers of concentration and discipline. \n\n The nembutsu taught\nin Amida’s vow, however, as the simple voicing of\n“Namu-amida-butsu” accessible to all beings regardless of\ntheir moral qualities or spiritual capacities, was specifically\nselected by Amida Buddha as the means by which he could bring to\nfruition his compassionate vow to liberate all living things from\nsamsaric existence. In other words, Amida, through his vow and the\nsalvific virtue of his own already completed performance of endless\naeons of bodhisattva practices, established the saying of the Name as\nthe medium by which his own compassionate working actively reaches each\nbeing. Thus, the nembutsu has been prepared for beings as effective\npractice—already fulfilled by Amida as the act resulting\nin birth in the Pure Land. This salvific activity is particularly\nappropriate in the present age, when the accomplishment of praxis as\nordinarily understood in Buddhist tradition has receded beyond the\nreach of beings. Anticipating this situation, Amida’s vow teaches\nthat one should relinquish the illusions and attachments focused on the\nself and its capacities and set aside the extensive body of traditional\nmethods of praxis as no longer effective, since they require a purity\nof performance no longer achievable. The Pure Land tradition\ncharacterizes such practices as “self-power” and advocates\ninstead a turn to the saying the nembutsu as the act that embodies\n“Other Power,” Amida Buddha’s wisdom-compassion\nfunctioning in the world. \n\n Two aspects of\nHōnen historical role relate directly to our concerns here with\nphilosophical aspects of interpreting and articulating his religious\nawareness: the means by which Hōnen effected his ground-breaking\ncontribution to Buddhist tradition, and Hōnen’s legacy as\ninherited by his disciples. Regarding the first, Hōnen is\nrecognized as the first and perhaps most revolutionary\n“founder” of a native Japanese Buddhist tradition. Based on\nhis principle of “the nembutsu selected in Amida’s primal\nvow” (senjaku hongan nembutsu) as the practice embodying\nthe Buddha’s Other Power, he established the Pure Land school\n(Jōdoshū) as an authentic Buddhist path, effective in itself\nand independent from the traditionally recognized schools that had been\ntransmitted to Japan from the Asian continent over the preceding\ncenturies. Hōnen set about to accomplish this in his major\nwriting, Collection on the Nembutsu Selected in the Primal Vow\n(Senchaku hongan nembutsu-shū), composed in\nkanbun (Chinese) and addressed to an audience versed in\nBuddhist erudition and its methods of discourse. Here, Hōnen\nsystematically raises the traditional issues involved in recognizing\nthe Pure Land teaching as a legitimate school of Buddhism, such as the\nidentification of foundational sutras, the delineation of the\nhistorical lineage of masters by which the Pure Land path has been\ntransmitted down to the present, and its doctrinal orthodoxy,\ndemonstrated with reference to the sutras and the commentarial\ntradition. In his work, Hōnen argues logically and cogently on the\nbasis of scriptural evidence, including extended citations from the\nrecognized Chinese canon. \n\n Hōnen allowed\nhis work to be copied only by disciples during his lifetime, but it was\npublished shortly after his death. It immediately garnered vehement\ncensure and counter-argument from scholar-monks of traditional schools,\nattesting to the impact Hōnen’s nembutsu teaching was\nalready having in Japanese society, but also to the recognition of the\nforms of scholastic discourse and rational argument into which his\nthought had been cast. From the accounts of his followers and records\nof his spoken words and letters, it appears that Hōnen was an\nimmensely charismatic figure, communicating his teaching to both the\nordained and lay and persuasively responding to the questions of his\nmany listeners from all walks of life. Nevertheless, the major\nformulation of his religious thought followed customary models,\ndictated by his formidable role in Buddhist history. \n\n As we have seen,\nHōnen asserted that the nembutsu as imparted to beings in\nAmida’s vow differs profoundly from all other practices handed\ndown in Buddhist tradition. Persons might, therefore, perform the\nutterance of the Buddha’s name as another means of healing the\nmind and gaining merit, in continuous recitation or as an element of\nritual worship or contemplative practice, or they might say the name as\nthe act prescribed in Amida’s vow, entrusting themselves wholly\nto the working of the Buddha’s compassion and abandoning any\nnotion of their own goodness or effort as contributing to realization.\nThe former manifests self-power, the latter Other Power. Hōnen\ntaught that it is only the latter that remains operative now for us.\nHowever, a serious difficulty in understanding this teaching arose\namong Hōnen’s following, one Hōnen struggled to deal\nwith but was unable to resolve doctrinally. \n\n Disciples found\nthat the nembutsu of Amida’s vow as proclaimed by Hōnen in\nfact involves two elements, both of which are essential: on the one\nhand, the actual saying of Amida’s Name,\n“Namu-amida-butsu,” and on the other, the wholehearted\nentrusting of oneself to Amida’s vow, which, as we have seen, is\nprecisely what qualitatively distinguishes vocal nembutsu from all\nother methods of practice and makes one’s performance of it the\npractice selected for beings and already fulfilled by Amida. For\nHōnen, these two elements of practice and faith—utterance of\nthe nembutsu and the entrusting of oneself to Amida’s\nvow—were mutually and unproblematically interfused, but many who\nsought to follow his teaching found that in actual engagement, the path\nappeared to be defined by emphasis on one element or the other. The\nquestion became for many followers: which is central in the life lived\nin genuine accord with Amida’s vow, practice or faith? In other\nwords, concretely, how should persons of the nembutsu carry on their\nlives? \n\n Those who\nemphasized practice tended to assume that since the nembutsu was\ndevised and provided out of Amida’s wisdom-compassion, those who\nentrust themselves to the Buddha’s vow will spontaneously, out of\njoy and gratitude, seek to live in mindfulness of Amida and to recite\nthe name as often as possible throughout the remainder of their lives.\nThis view, however, sometimes shaded into ethical and eschatological\nconcerns. Some assumed that practitioners of the nembutsu should seek\nto live lives appropriate for birth into Amida’s buddha-field,\nlives of diligent recitation and moral rectitude; those who failed to\ndisplay such dedication were viewed as negligent in their practice.\nFurther, many adopted older views rooted in the Contemplation\nSutra, in which nembutsu recitation was seen pragmatically, as a\nmeans of cancelling the karmic effects of one’s past evil. This\nlatter belief gave decisive weight to the nembutsu uttered at the\nmoment of death, when the nullification of one’s final\ndefilements of karmic evil made birth in the Pure Land possible. \n\n By contrast, those\nwho emphasized trust tended toward a more relaxed view of nembutsu\nrecitation and other forms of religious observance or moral rigor,\ninsisting instead on a total trust in Amida’s compassion. The\nPure Land sutras speak of ten or even a single utterance as adequate,\nand Hōnen affirms this teaching, since the name as prepared for\nbeings by Amida holds the resultant virtues of his inconceivably long\nand perfect practice. When one takes refuge in the vow and utters the\nnembutsu, one’s salvation is promised by Amida and one should\nhave no misgivings. At an extreme, however, insistence on leaving all\nto Amida’s salvific activity led to forms of antinomianism, in\nwhich even moral restraint was viewed as the impulse to deny the fact\nof one’s cravings and affirm one’s own goodness. In more\nbenign forms, emphasis on trust led to a denigration of continued\nutterance as evidence of doubt of the vow’s power and as a\nresidue of attachment to one’s own action in bringing about\nattainment. \n\n Hōnen sought\nto maintain a tenuous balance between these two, mutually disparaging\npositions of emphasis on praxis and emphasis on faith: \n\nIf, because it is taught [in the Larger Sutra] that birth is\nattained with but one or ten utterances, you say the nembutsu\nheedlessly, then faith is hindering practice. If, because it is taught\n[in Shandao’s commentaries] that you should say the Name\n“without abandoning it from moment to moment,” you believe\none or ten utterances to be indecisive, then practice is hindering\nfaith. As your faith, accept that birth is attained with a single\nutterance; as your practice, endeavor in the nembutsu throughout\nlife. (recorded in “Zenshō-bō ni shimesu\non-kotoba,” in Kyōdō 1987, p. 464 and in Hirota 1989,\npp. 12–13)\n \n\nHistorically, however, we find that while Hōnen was able to\ntransmit his insights through his own compelling presence, after his\ndeath, his disciples developed their individual interpretations of his\nnembutsu teaching in diverse directions, with some tending toward\nemphasis on nembutsu practice and other toward trust in the vow. The\nmaster, in short, failed to achieve a clear doctrinal resolution of\nthis issue of religious life. In other words, he was unable to give a\npersuasive account of the nexus between sentient being and Other Power,\nand appears finally to affirm anew the efficacy of human action, as\neither recitation of the name of Amida or entrusting of oneself to\nAmida’s vow, or as a combination of both. \n\n The question of the\nrelationship between a person’s act of nembutsu and Amida\nBuddha’s Other Power—or between trust in Amida’s vow,\nwhich infuses each human act of nembutsu with Other Power, and the\npractice of the nembutsu, which has been devised and made efficacious\nfor beings by the Buddha—raises profound questions concerning the\nsources and significance of human subjectivity and agency. Above all,\nthe emergence of such issues within the context of a thoroughgoing\napplication of the general Mahayana critique of self-attachment in\nreligious praxis gave rise to the most innovative philosophical\nreflection in the Japanese Pure Land tradition. Thus, it is among\ndisciples of Hōnen who tended toward the pole of emphasis on trust\nor on the adequacy of a single utterance an engagement with issues that\nhave a distinct resonance with intellectual concerns today. This is\nbecause such disciples found it necessary to take up questions of\none’s self-awareness in the relationship between being and Buddha\nin the immediate present and to delineate a groundwork for\ndeconstructing commonsense subject-object dualisms applied to this\nrelationship without recourse to abstract conceptions of mystical\ntranscendence. \n\n At the same time,\nall of Hōnen’s disciples found it necessary to formulate\nresponses to the relentless criticisms of the traditional schools,\nwhich led periodically to state suppression of the nembutsu teaching,\nand some resorted to adjustment of various positions Hōnen’s\nlogic led him to. For example, one of the leading disciples,\nShōkō (1162–1238), founder of the dominant Chinzei branch of\nthe Jōdo school, abandoned Hōnen’s view that only the\nnembutsu could lead to birth in the Pure Land and recognized the\nefficacy of the traditional practices. Others, however, such as\nShinran, Shōkū (1177–1247), and Ippen (1239–1289), pursued\nthe development of Hōnen’s radical teaching, each in his own\ndistinctive way, and it is among such figures that we find the more\nphilosophical strains of thinking. \n\n Let us turn here to\nseveral basic issues in Pure Land Buddhist thought that (1) emerged\nfrom problems of practical engagement but were given characteristic\ntreatment specifically in Japan, and (2) may be considered to have\nreceived philosophical attention in the sense that, regarding them,\nJapanese Pure Land Buddhists were forced, by intra-sectarian debate, to\nseek a degree of intellectual self-understanding distinct both from\nscholastic Buddhist discourse and from the kind of realization achieved\nthrough religious engagement. \n\n In addition, for\nconvenience, I will discuss these issues under the headings of\nmetaphysics, anthropology, hermeneutics, and ethics. It should be borne\nin mind, however, that these Western categories, while helpful in\nestablishing a starting point and pursuing the comparative concerns\nimplied in a “philosophical” approach to Buddhist thought,\nsuggest conceptual contours that must in fact be continually breached\nin seeking to accommodate the fundamentally pragmatic orientation of\nthe Japanese Pure Land tradition and its roots in Mahayana Buddhist\nthought. In fact, the four headings are best understood as slightly\ndiffering perspectives on essentially the same central problem: the\napprehension of what is true and real from within a stance of radical\nconditionedness. What enables such apprehension? What is its\nsignificance for human existence? How does it come about? And what\nimplications does it hold for the conduct of life? \n\n The principal\nmetaphysical question occasioned by Japanese Pure Land Buddhism arises\nmost naturally concerning the meaning of a being’s birth in the\nPure Land and the ontological status of Amida Buddha. Although Western\nresearchers have often been confident in imposing substantialist\nassumptions on Pure Land thought, asserting, for example, that\nHōnen and his followers thought of the Pure Land as a geographical\nplace, and although many Pure Land Buddhists assume that past thinkers\nregarded the Dharmakara-Amida narrative as historical in a modern\nsense, in fact the dominant traditional motif in treating questions of\nthe reality of Amida and the Pure Land reflects, not such notions as\nsubstance, identity, autonomy, and permanence, but an interactive,\ndynamic movement across provisional dichotomies of formless reality and\nform, enlightened wisdom and ignorance, transtemporality and time,\nbuddha and sentient being. This thinking characterized by the\ndiscriminative perception of the world of beings rooted in the\nnondiscriminative apprehension of reality may be seen in relation to\nthe question of the real existence of beings born in the Pure Land in\nthe following passage from the sixth century Chinese Pure Land thinker\nTanluan (476–542): \n\nThe “birth” to which Bodhisattva Vasubandhu aspires\nrefers to being born through causal conditions. Hence it is\nprovisionally termed “birth.” This does not mean that there\nare real beings or that being born and dying is real, as ordinary\npeople imagine. \n\nWe see that from very early in the East Asian tradition, as well\nknown in Japan, Pure Land thinkers applied the Mahayana logic of the\nnonduality and interpenetration of discriminative and nondiscriminative\nrealms to Pure Land concepts. \n\nRegarding the nature of Amida Buddha, perhaps the most natural\napproach for the modern mind is to focus on the relationship between\nAmida and Sakyamuni. While Amida, Buddha of infinite light and eternal\nlife, may be regarded as the “celestial” personification of\nperfect wisdom-compassion, and the narrative of his attainment in the\ninconceivable past as “mythic,” Gotama, known by his\nhonorific title Sakyamuni Buddha, is recognized as a historical figure,\na mendicant wanderer and religious teacher of India in the fifth\ncentury BCE. It is common to say, therefore, that Sakyamuni belongs to\nthe realm of historical fact and actual existence, while Amida is\nfictive. This view is supported by the modern understanding of the\nrelationship between the two buddhas. Sakyamuni, having become the\n“awakened one” through meditative practices, taught his\nrealization to others, and among the teachings attributed to him is the\nstory of Amida Buddha. Although historical evidence now suggests that\nthe teaching of Amida gradually emerged around the beginning of the\ncommon era—five centuries after Sakyamuni’s\ndeath—even if it appeared later in the tradition stemming from\nSakyamuni, the fundamental question of the relationship between Amida\nand the person(s) who first taught him remains unchanged. Amida Buddha\nhas never appeared directly as a historical personage, and there are no\nteachings or words that can be attributed to him. Thus, it is common to\nview the story of Amida as a narrative fashioned by Sakyamuni (or a\nlater figure) to express the content of his own religious insight.\nSince his awakening could not be conveyed directly, he resorted to the\nuse of parables and myths, and the story of Amida is considered such a\n“skillful means” (hōben) or mythic device for\nteaching. In this view, Amida is a fiction whose origins lie in the\nexperience of Sakyamuni. Further, it is often assumed that while\nunlettered Pure Land adherents may have clung to the notion of Amida\nand his vows as real, taking them as objects of faith, more\nsophisticated Buddhists such as those of the Tendai, Shingon, and Zen\nschools recognized all along that Amida is merely a skillful\n“metaphor” or “symbol” for the historical\nrealization of Sakyamuni. \n\nIn fact, there is basic continuity in the perspective on Amida among\nthe Mahayana schools, and it stands diametrically opposed to modernist\nassumptions. For Mahayana Buddhists, reality resides not fundamentally\nwith the historical existence of Sakyamuni as such, but rather with\nthat for which he is recognized as buddha, or that which is the\nmotive-force for his appearance in the world, his attainment of\nbuddhahood, and his teaching of dharma. Reality assumes form in order\nto emerge into the consciousness of sentient beings and thereby guide\nbeings beyond the attachments and compulsions of their discriminative,\nreifying, conceptual grasp of their own existence and the things of the\nworld around them. \n\nThis circular dynamic moving between formless reality and the world\nof forms may be seen with regard to the relationship between Sakaymuni\nand Amida in Hōnen’s exposition. He states: \n\nConcerning the central purport [of the Larger Sutra]:\nSakyamuni discarded the supreme Pure Land and appeared in this defiled\nworld; this was to expound the teaching of the Pure land and, by\nencouraging sentient beings, to bring them to birth in the Pure Land.\nAmida Tathagata discarded this defiled world and emerged in the Pure\nLand; this was to guide sentient beings of this defiled world and bring\nthem to birth in the Pure Land. This is none other than the fundamental\nintent with which all buddhas go out to the Pure Land and emerge in the\ndefiled\n world. (Muryōjukyō shaku in Kyōdō 1987, p. 67)\n \n\nIn Hōnen’s view, Sakyamuni and Amida function as paired\naspects of a movement of compassionate activity in teaching and\nguiding, out of true reality into the defiled world, and out from the\ndefiled world into “the supreme Pure Land” that is the\nabode of all buddhas. We see here that Hōnen transforms the\nframework of historical sequence by beginning with Sakyamuni, even\nthough Amida’s attainment of buddhahood occurred aeons prior to\nSakyamuni’s appearance. Without Sakyamuni, Amida would remain\nunknown to beings in this world and his work of leading all to his\nbuddha-field would go unapprehended; without Amida, Sakyamuni would\nhave no effective means of liberating beings and his teaching mission\nwould be futile. In place of a linear chronology, we have a motif of\nmovement between the timeless and mundane time, by which the\ntemporality of karmic causation and discriminative thinking is\nbroken. \n\n Shinran develops\nthe reciprocity between Amida and Sakyamuni seen in Hōnen into an\nasymmetric relationship, and by thus giving priority to Amida, moves\neven further from a modern orientation that would emphasize the\nhistorical reality of Sakyamuni. For Shinran, it is the motive-force of\nwisdom-compassion that underlies the historical existence of\nSakyamuni—that in fact made him buddha—and this\nwisdom-compassion is itself the life of Amida Buddha. Hence,\nSakyamuni’s historical existence may be understood as a\nmanifestation of Amida, perhaps one among countless others. \n\nThis understanding may be seen in Shinran’s demonstration that\nthe Larger Sutra, among all the sutras, expresses the true\nteaching for which Sakyamuni appeared in the world. Shinran focuses on\nthe pattern in the sutras by which, prior to expounding dharma, the\nBuddha enters a profound samadhi and delves to the nondiscriminative\nwisdom that transcends words and concepts. On emerging from the\nsamadhi, he reemerges into the realm of words and responds to questions\nfrom his disciples. While his words are those of ordinary human\ndiscourse, they give expression to the samadhi he attained. Thus, the\nsource of Sakyamuni’s teaching is the samadhi he entered, the\ntranscendent reality or wisdom itself. \n\nAt the beginning of the Larger Sutra, Sakyamuni’s\ndisciple Ānanda observes, from the splendor and serenity apparent\nin the Buddha’s countenance, that the Buddha has entered the\nsamadhi of great tranquility (Jp. daijakujō, in the Tang\ntranslation titled Sutra of the Tathagata of Immeasurable\nLife) and requests him to explain its significance. Sakyamuni\nproceeds to deliver the teaching of Amida Buddha. In other words,\nSakyamuni has attained the reality that is the essential quality of all\nBuddhas—in a commentary on the Larger Sutra it is called\nthe “place where all Buddhas abide”—and on this basis\nhe reveals the story of Amida, for Amida is the primordial Buddha who\nembodies the essence of all Buddhas. From the perspective of this\nsutra, were it not for Amida, whose Buddhahood lies at the heart of the\nsamadhi of great tranquility, Sakyamuni himself would not be Buddha. At\nthe same time, were it not for Sakyamuni, the teaching of Amida would\nnot be disclosed to the world. \n\nThus, the relationship between Amida and Sakyamuni is not that\nbetween two distinct figures, or between the religious symbol taught\nand the teacher. Rather, it is viewed in a broader framework of\nAmida’s characteristic as standing both in formless reality and\nthe world of forms, in the eternal and in history. Sakyamuni is not\nseparate from Amida, and in teaching dharma he manifests the activity\nor movement towards beings that is Amida’s essential quality. \n\n It may be said that\nwhile meditative traditions in Buddhism tend to emphasize the\nelimination of delusional thinking and the apprehension of formless\nreality free of the imposition of egocentric discrimination, the Pure\nLand tradition is attentive to the compassionate working of reality to\nawaken beings incapable of eradicating conceptual thought. It does so\nby manifesting itself in forms and approaching beings. Late in life,\nShinran adopted the term jinen, “naturalness” or\n“being made to become so of itself,” for the spontaneous\nworking of reality in the liberative process by which beings of\nafflicting passions reach enlightenment. In this process, the Mahayana\nassertion that “samsara is none other than nirvana” or\n“afflicting passions are none other than awakening” is\naffirmed, so that the end of the Pure Land path lies in this world, in\nthe compassionate working for the liberation of all beings. \n\n In relation to\nbeings of the world, Pure Land thinkers such as Shōkū and\nShinran asserted that the real, as itself nondiscriminative and\nnondualistic wisdom or suchness, pervades all things. Since beings\ncannot attain such wisdom, reality as such cannot be grasped.\nNevertheless, through that which is real that permeates their\nexistence, all beings, including “grasses, trees, and the land\nitself,” hold the potential for awakening. Such terms as\n“emptiness” and “dependent origination” are\nsometimes understood in metaphysical terms, but in the context of\nMahayana Buddhist tradition, they are not concepts by which to grasp\nreality, but above all elements of practice, expressing the realization\nof the person who enters into profound samadhi by cutting off\ndiscriminative thought and eradicating afflicting passions. Because the\nPure Land path is not based on such praxis, the use of such terms is\nunnecessary. \n\n For Hōnen and\nhis followers, the characterization of “deep mind” (one of\n“three minds” or attitudes prescribed in the\nContemplation Sutra) by the Chinese master Shandao (613–681)\nprovides a classic expression of the understanding of human existence\nin the Pure Land path: \n\n“Deep mind” is the deeply entrusting mind. There are two\naspects. One is to believe deeply and decidedly that you are a foolish\nbeing of karmic evil caught in birth-and-death, ever sinking and ever\nwandering in transmigration from innumerable kalpas in the past, with\nnever a condition that would lead to emancipation. The second is to\nbelieve deeply and decidedly that Amida Buddha’s Forty-eight Vows grasp\nsentient beings, and that allowing yourself to be carried by the power\nof the Vow without any doubt or apprehension, you will\nattain\n birth. (Commentary on the Contemplation Sutra, quoted in Shinran CWS I: 85.)\n \n\nSecond [of the three minds] is deep mind, which is true and real\nshinjin. One truly knows oneself to be a foolish being full of blind\npassions, with scant roots of good, transmigrating in the three realms\nand unable to emerge from this burning house. And further, one truly\nknows now, without so much as a single thought of doubt, that Amida’s\nuniversal Primal Vow decisively enables all to attain birth, including\nthose who say the Name even down to ten times, or even but\nhear\n it. (Hymns of birth in the Pure Land, quoted in Shinran CWS I: 92)\n \n\nThree points may be noted here. First, the self-awareness of the\npractitioner indicated by Shan-tao is that of a human being wholly\nincapable of fulfilling Buddhist practices. This is expressed in\neschatological terms of endless entrapment in samsaric existence: one\nis burdened by the karmic consequences of evil acts of past lives\nextending from the immeasurable past; one continues to act from the\ndesires and hatreds arising from ignorant self-attachment in the\npresent; bereft as one is of any genuine goodness, one’s future\ncan only be further painful existence in endless transmigration. \n\n The second point is\nthat this self-awareness coexists with the realization that all beings\nare enabled to attain birth in the Pure Land through Amida’s Vow.\nIn other words, the self-reflection implied in deep mind is, in its\nopposite aspect, at the same time deep trust in the salvific power of\nAmida. The third point is that while human being and Buddha stand thus\nas thoroughgoing opposites—the being filled with afflicting\npassions and lacking any goodness that might lead toward enlightenment,\non the one hand, and the Buddha freely exerting the power of\nwisdom-compassion, on the other—deep mind arises as a unitary\nawareness out of the interaction of being and Buddha. Self-reflection\nand trust arise simultaneously. Without the approach of Amida, not only\ntrust, but also genuine self-awareness is unattainable. \n\n Hōnen, who was\nrenown in his period as a Tendai monk of extensive learning and\nexemplary practice, gives direct expression to the two aspects of\n“deep mind”: \n\nAlthough Buddhism is vast, in essence it is composed of no more than\nthe three learnings [of precepts, meditation, and wisdom.] … But\nas for precepts, I myself do not keep a single one. In meditation, I\nhave not attained even one. In wisdom, I have not attained the right\nwisdom of cutting off discriminative thinking and realizing the\nfruit… . [Nevertheless,] without distinguishing between wise and\nfoolish, the upholding of precepts and the breaking of them, Amida\nBuddha comes to welcome\n us. (Recorded in Tetsu senchaku hongan nembutsu shū, Jōdoshū\nzensho 7: 95–96)\n \n\nIt is in such self-awareness that we see the force behind\nHōnen’s radical reorientation of the understanding of\npraxis. Hōnen saw clearly that unless a wholly new perspective\nwere established regarding the categorization and evaluation of the\nmyriad practices taught in Buddhist tradition, the genuine meaning of\nthe Pure Land path as he had come to understand it would remain\nobscure, and vocal nembutsu would continue to be viewed by all people\nas merely an expedient practice for inferior practitioners. He\ntherefore raised the issue of the subjectivity of the practitioner, and\ninsisted that commonsense hierarchies rooted in presuppositions of\none’s own fundamental perspicuity and autonomous capacity to\njudge had to be abandoned. To accomplish this shift, Hōnen relied\non the thoroughgoing application of his innovative concept of\n“selection from among alternatives” (senchaku),\nwhich refers most centrally to Amida’s own selection, for beings,\nof vocal nembutsu as the single, universally accessible practice that\nresults in birth into the Pure Land. Beings’ taking up of the\nPure Land path is thus founded upon Amida’s selection and\nfulfillment of the nembutsu for all beings equally. We see, therefore,\nthat the dual awareness of “deep mind” is at the core of\nHōnen’s path. \n\n Hōnen’s\nmethodical logic led to positions easily vilified by scholar-monks of\nthe traditional schools. One example is his enumeration of “the\nawakening of aspiration for enlightenment” (hotsu\nbodaishin) among the traditional “practices” to be set\naside by nembutsu practitioners. This\n“bodhi-mind”—the profound aspiration for\nenlightenment for oneself and all beings—had been taught to be\nthe crucial starting point for the Mahayana bodhisattva, and other\nJapanese Pure Land masters such as Genshin had affirmed it to be the\ncore of genuine desire for the Pure Land. Although Hōnen’s\nposition is somewhat ambiguous, in Senchakushū his\nsteadfast logic leads understandably to a rejection of the notion that\nany attitude or attainment beyond trust and utterance is necessary for\nthe person of nembutsu. \n\n Hōnen’s\nreligious anthropology is perhaps the hallmark of his tradition, but\nhis closest disciples sought to balance his rejection of self-power\nwith the delineation of the working of Other Power in the practitioner.\nOne of the harshest criticisms of Hōnen from the traditional\nschools came from Myōe (1173–1232), of the Kegon school. Myōe\nargued that awakening the bodhi-mind was not to be viewed as a specific\npractice within the path, but as the core of all authentic Mahayana\npraxis, which must be infused with the nondiscriminative wisdom that is\nalso compassion. Thus, Hōnen’s rejection of bodhi-mind was a\ndeparture from the fundamental truths of Mahayana Buddhism itself. \n\n On a superficial\nlevel, the answer to Myōe was not difficult for Hōnen’s\nfollowers. Disciples such as Shinran and Shōkū affirmed the\nrole of the bodhi-mind in the Pure Land path by identifying it with\ntrust in Amida’s vow on the part of practitioners. Shinran, for\nexample, distinguishes various types of bodhi-mind and identifies that\nof the true Pure Land path with his conception of shinjin.\nShōkū similarly identifies the taking of refuge in the vow\nwith bodhi-mind. Myōe’s criticism, however, points to the\nunderlying issue of the stark dualism of the unenlightened being and\nthe enlightened Buddha in Hōnen’s teaching. If there is no\ncause in beings leading to attainment, how can even trust in\nAmida’s vow arise in them? If they have the ability to give rise\nto trust, can they not perform other practices also? \n\n Hōnen’s\ndisciples again elaborate diverse conceptions of trust in Amida’s\nvow, but at bottom there are two elements. That which is real\n(suchness, thusness, nondual reality, buddha-nature, etc.) pervades all\nbeings; nevertheless, beings can come to awareness of it only in\nrelation to Amida Buddha, which is manifested in trust in the vow. The\nquestion of the nature of the relation leads to the problem of\nhermeneutics. \n\n Issues of\nhermeneutics are central to the Japanese Pure Land tradition because of\nthe discontinuity it asserts between the ordinary awareness of beings\nand the enlightened wisdom-compassion of the Buddha, which is the\nsource and ultimate content of the teaching. This is not, of course, a\nproblem limited to the Pure Land tradition, but is taken up in Buddhist\ntradition from the time of Sakyamuni’s earliest preaching.\nNevertheless, the communication of the intent of the teaching raises\nspecial difficulties in Hōnen’s Pure Land thought because of\nthe thoroughly negative assessment of human capacities of comprehension\nundistorted by self-attachment. Authentic grasp of the teaching\ntherefore requires both (1) the working of Buddhas—Amida,\nSakyamuni, and the buddhas of the cosmos—to bridge the gap\nbetween beings’ ignorance and dharma and to bring beings to\napprehension of the vow, and (2) a shift or transformation of awareness\nin beings. \n\n The narrative\nsettings of the Pure Land teachings in the sutras were regarded as\nparticularly significant in this regard. The Contemplation\nSutra was especially important in Hōnen’s\ninterpretation of Amida’s vow, and narratives in that sutra were\nunderstood to reveal both Sakyamuni’s intent in expounding the\nPure Land teaching and the proper stance for understanding it.\nAccording to the sutra, the circumstances for Sakyamuni’s\nteaching of Amida and his Pure Land relate to the story of Prince\nAjātaśatru, who, prompted by the Buddha’s jealous\ncousin Devadatta, usurps the throne by murdering his father and\nimprisoning his mother Vaidehi. From her cell, Vaidehi beseeches the\nBuddha to teach her a way to be born in a world free of such treachery\nand turmoil. This leads to Sakyamuni’s exposition of\nAmida’s Pure Land. \n\n In East Asian Pure\nLand tradition, this royal “tragedy of the capital of\nRājagṛha,” where Sakyamuni often resided and preached,\nwas understood to indicate that the Pure Land teaching was intended for\nordinary, unenlightened beings in anguished circumstances, rather than\nfor a capable spiritual elite. Shinran emphasizes the distance between\nthis world and the realm of enlightenment by asserting that at the\npoint in history when conditions were ripe for teaching and reception\nof the Pure Land path, the entire drama of regicide and betrayal was\nplayed out by incarnated bodhisattvas precisely to allow for the\nintroduction of the Pure Land teaching. It is, therefore, the condition\nof self-reflection and repentance that allows for the reception of the\nPure Land teaching. As we have seen, for the Pure Land tradition that\nHōnen adopted from China, this motif is reiterated in the sutra\nnarrative of the lowest grade of nembutsu practitioner, who has\ncommitted evil throughout his life but encounters the teaching through\na good friend on his deathbed and simply utters Amida’s name ten\ntimes. \n\n In terms of\nreception, some among Hōnen’s disciples further emphasized\nthe action of Amida and Sakyamuni in guiding and actively bringing\nbeings to trust in the vow. While the Chinzei branch of\nHōnen’s Pure Land school sought to temper the master’s\nsweeping rejection of other practices by recognizing the possibility of\nattaining birth through the various meditative and nonmeditative\npractices set forth in the Contemplation Sutra,\nShōkū and his Seizan branch taught that the intent of the\nsutra is precisely to lead people to awareness that birth is possible\nonly through the nembutsu. In the latter view, the various\ncontemplative exercises and the disciplines and study taught by the\nsutra are meant to reveal the wisdom-compassion of the vow, which\ngrasps all beings without discrimination, whatever their capacity.\nSince in the sutra beings attain birth regardless of their particular\nlevel or kind of practice, it is not that those practices are being\nprescribed; rather, the sutra intends to show that the actual cause of\nbirth lies not in any such practices, but solely in Amida’s vow.\nIn other words, the sutra teachings are not to be taken literally, but\nas means to awaken beings so that they entrust themselves to the\nvow. \n\n In Shinran, the\nactivity of the vow is more direct, for he asserts that shinjin in\nbeings is itself the mind of Amida and that Amida gives his mind to\nbeings. Thus, for example, Shinran interprets the nembutsu to be not\nthe invocation of the Buddha by beings but rather the Buddha’s\ncall to beings in order to awaken them. Shōkū makes a similar\nclaim, asserting that when a person takes refuge in Amida’s vow,\nthen the Buddha, who is the embodiment of perfect practice performed\nout of the desire to save all beings, enters and becomes one with the\nperson’s aspiration. This oneness manifests itself as the\nnembutsu. We see in such thinkers that genuine engagement with the\nteaching is not primarily intellectual understanding or simple assent,\nbut a transformative encounter in which the dualism of the\nperson’s samsaric existence and Amida’s wisdom-compassion\nis transcendent. \n\n The disciples of\nHōnen who pursued the teaching that birth in the Pure Land became\nsettled with a single utterance in trust explored the reasons this\nshould be so and also its consequences for ongoing life in the present.\nAs we have seen, Hōnen taught that the vocal nembutsu was\nqualitatively distinct from all other practices, being effective as\npractice because it has been fulfilled by Amida and given to beings.\nPrecisely how it was given remained an issue. For disciples like\nShōkō, the nembutsu was determined by Amida but retained its\nquality as practice in that it was to be repeated by a person\nthroughout life, even though a single utterance was taught to be\nsufficient. Thinkers like Shinran and Shōkū, however, both\nunderstood the utterance of nembutsu to be fulfilled practice because\nit arises from the oneness of being and Buddha expressed as shinjin or\ntaking refuge. Further, because of this oneness, a person’s\nattainment of birth in the Pure Land is completely settled in the\nimmediate present. \n\n The effects of the\noneness are manifested not only in the occurrence of birth in the Pure\nLand at death, but also in various ways in present life.\nShōkū speaks of a variety of benefits received in the present\nby the person of the nembutsu, including the elimination of the effects\nof past evil acts, extension of life, avoidance of various calamities,\nprotection of buddhas, seeing of Amida, and so on. One should not\npursue such benefits for their own sake, but they naturally come about\nfor the person of the nembutsu whose birth in the Pure Land is settled.\nThus, to express the condition of the nembutsu practitioner,\nShōkū even distinguishes two types of Pure Land\n“birth,” “immediate birth” (sokuben\nōjō) while remaining burdened with afflicting passions\nin present life and birth into the Pure Land at the time of death\n(tōtoku ōjō). \n\nShōkū’s thinking about ethical life reflects the same\nelements seen in relation to benefits in this life: the person\ncontinues to act out of ignorance and self-attachment, but conduct\nmanifesting oneness with Amida Buddha may also emerge spontaneously. He\nspeaks, for example, of the elimination of the effects of past evil\nacts through repentance (zange metsuzai). He distinguishes,\nhowever, between two kinds or stages of repentance, that which is\ndeliberately undertaken at particular times through ones own powers of\nself-reflection and contrition, but which is difficult to achieve\n(gyōmon no zange), and that which arises spontaneously\nand immediately as the working of the vow (kanmon no zange).\nAs seen here, ethical behavior is not prescribed and undertaken as\nanother form of praxis, but Other Power may function of itself in the\nlife of the nembutsu practitioner to suppress evil and manifest\ncompassion action. \n\n Such thinking may\nalso be seen in Shinran, who includes, in his list of ten benefits\nobtained by the nembutsu practitioner in the present, “constantly\nenacting great compassion.” In letters, he states:  \nThose\nwho feel that their own birth is completely settled should, mindful of\nthe Buddha’s benevolence, hold the nembutsu in their hearts and\nsay it to respond in gratitude to that benevolence, with the wish,\n“May there be peace in the world, and may the Buddha’s\nteaching spread!”. (Shinran CWS I: 560)  \nIn the face of the\npersecution of the nembutsu by local authorities, he advises his\ndisciples:  \nThe people who are trying to obstruct the nembutsu\nare the manor lords, bailiffs, and landowners in the local areas\n… . practicers of the nembutsu should act with compassion for\nthose who commit such obstruction, feel pity for them, and earnestly\nsay the nembutsu, thereby helping those who seek to hinder them.\n(Shinran CWS I: 563–564)  \nFor Shinran, the working of Other Power is precisely\nthe falling away of one’s own calculative thinking, seeking\nreligious or worldly advantage through one’s own capacities.\nThus, where self-power has been “overturned,” acts\nspontaneously possessed of compassion arise unprescribed and\nundeliberated. \n\n For both\nShōkū and Shinran, the life of the nembutsu practitioner is\ninformed by a transformed temporality. This is especially clear in\nShinran, who adopts the distinction of two dimensions or phases of\nAmida’s activity—that for beings’ birth in the Pure\nLand (ōsō ekō) and that for their immediate\nreturn from the Pure Land to this world in order to work for the\nliberation of all beings (gensō ekō). The ethical\nideal of genuinely compassionate action—action that leads others\nto liberation from ignorance—exists in the present for the\nnembutsu practitioner as a goal one looks forward to in the future,\nbeyond all falsification by self-attachments. It is the teleological\nfulfillment of human existence that unfolds only by Other Power. At the\nsame time, that goal, as the content of birth in the Pure Land that is\nalready settled in the present, pervades present existence, interfused\nwith the karmic burden of the samsaric past. What is authentically\nknown of such a self by the nembutsu practitioner, according to both\nShōkū and Shinran, is the repentance that is also\nAmida’s wisdom-compassion. \n\nThe term modernity commonly indicates the cultural principles\nstemming from the European Enlightenment that became dominant globally\nin the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including such\nideals as reason, empirical science, individualism, freedom, and so\non. Japan’s encounter with modernity represents a particularly\nclear and well-defined case, for up until the mid-nineteenth century,\nJapan had an official policy of isolation, restricting all\ninternational contact. Political stability, including religious\ninstitutions, had continued without significant threat or conflict for\nnearly two and a half centuries, during which a relatively peaceful,\nprosperous, and culturally active citizenry flourished. After being\nforcibly opened to foreign commerce in 1853, Japanese leaders emerged\nwho were fearful of the efforts by Western powers to exert control\nover the country through utilizing internal conflict. They sought\nfundamental political change without large-scale civil warfare and\nsuccessfully effected a shift in power from the shogunate nominally to\nthe emperor in 1868. Further, they entered upon a deliberate program\nof importing and adopting Western learning, technology, and\nsociopolitical institutions. Christianity was perceived as woven into\nthe fabric of modern civilization and as providing the moral\nfoundation for Western advances. Hence, some Japanese believed the\nsuccessful assimilation of Western technology and social institution\nwould require the adoption of Christianity. \n\n During the four decades from\nthe opening of Japan to about the time of the World’s Parliament\nof Religions in Chicago in 1893, Buddhist institutions were forced into\na largely defensive posture in the face of programs for radical social\nchange and the influx of Christian missionizing. Buddhist reform\nmovements were beginning to arise, but on the whole it was a period for\nregrouping, apologetics, and new organizational rather than\nintellectual development. The observations and criticisms by Christian\nmissionaries regarding Japanese Buddhism during this period reveal the\nchallenges to which Buddhists sought to respond. An example is a\nlecture delivered by M. L. Gordon (1844-1900), a Congregational\nmissionary and teacher, to the “General Conference of the\nProtestant Missionaries of Japan” in Osaka in 1883. To more than\none hundred missionaries, Gordon, a scholar of Japanese Buddhism and\nauthor of tracts in both Japanese and English, discussed “the\nreligious influence of Buddhism as an obstacle to the reception of the\nGospel in Japan” (Gordon 1883). He notes that in the modernizing\nJapan of his time, “there are many among the educated classes who\nnot only have no sympathy with Buddhism but violently hate it.”\nStill, he believed Buddhism remained the primary impediment to\nmissionizing. Moreover, he identified Pure Land Buddhism,\nspecifically the Shin Buddhism (Jōdo Shinshū) in the\ntradition of Shinran’s thought, as “the most popular and\nflourishing” of Buddhist schools. Gordon’s critique of\nJapanese Buddhism, and of Shin Buddhism in particular, highlights\nissues that Buddhist thinkers have continued to grapple with in the\nmodern era up to today: reasoned understanding in the face of modern\nknowledge, existential engagement, and social action. \n\n Gordon’s attack on Pure\nLand Buddhism begins with the assertion that it “is not the\nBuddhism which Gotama taught” and, going even further, that\n“the Buddhism taught by the Shin sect of Japan is in some\nrespects exactly opposed to the teaching of Shakya” (Gordon 1882,\np. 108). Utilizing contemporaneous European scholarship in Sanskrit and\nPali, Gordon lists contradictions between “Buddhism as Gotama\ntaught it” and “the so-called Mahayana” teachings,\nwhich “are perversions rather than denials of the truth, and\nhence are all the more dangerous.” The problem Gordon encounters\nis partly a rift with Western rationality—what he calls the\nability “for the Buddhist mind to look a logical contradiction\nsquarely in the face without recognizing it.” Even more important\nto him, however, are how the perceived deviations in the Pure Land\ntradition that have transformed “original Buddhism” into a\nreligion in the mode of Christianity. \n\n Gordon adduces “the three\ngreat biblical doctrines” that for him evince\nChristianity’s superiority over Japanese Buddhism: “God,\nSin, and Salvation.” These touch on the philosophical issues of\nontology, anthropology, and ethics that we have considered, and\nadumbrate the topics Japanese Buddhists would take up and continue to\ntackle into the twentieth century. Gordon begins by remarking on\n“the difficulty of bringing the Buddhist to an adequate\nconception of God.” Here, the concept of God as creator is\npivotal for Gordon, in part because it identifies in God a unique\ntranscendence not present in the conceptions of Buddhas. As Japanese\nBuddhists pointed out in their first encounters with Christianity, the\nnotion of divine incarnation fits easily into a broad Japanese Buddhist\nparadigm of the emergence of form from formless reality. In\nGordon’s words, “The doctrine of the Incarnation may be\nreferred to … as having been greatly degraded by Buddhism.\nIncarnations are frequent.” Further, related to emergence or\nmanifestation is the ontological ambiguity of nonduality. Hence Gordon\nfinds, perhaps with some frustration, that “if we were to ask the\npriest who preaches this [Pure Land] doctrine … whether Amida\nreally exists or not, he would perhaps after some squirming admit that\neither view of the case is perfectly admissible.” \n\n For Gordon, God as creator\nserves as the linchpin for the other two key doctrines, sin and\nsalvation. In lacking a conception of creator, Buddhism\n“recognizes no supreme and intelligent Ruler and Judge of the\nuniverse.” This leads to “only a very inadequate idea of\nsin,” one that trivializes it and in fact promotes\n“immorality.” A further consequence is that salvation in\nBuddhism is “salvation from the misery of the present world\nrather than salvation from sin.” Pure Land Buddhism, in other\nwords, denigrates the significance of present life and looks only to\nthe promise of deliverance in the future. \n\n Christianity’s challenge\nto Japanese Buddhists involved what Gordon expressed as “power\nover the hearts and lives of men,” which had not necessarily been\nsought by the Japanese temple priests whose chief duty was to the\ncalendar of memorial ceremonies. In his autobiographical account of his\nministry, Gordon speaks of his converts’ testimony about the\ndepth of their experiences. He states: “A powerful impression of\n[sin] as a personal burden is not common. One old lady testified that\nshe had hardly thought of herself as a sinner, until she began to hear\nthis ‘new way.’ … Christianity alone brings true\nrepentance” (Gordon 1893, pp. 213-214). \n\n Gordon further states,\n“Christianity makes loving service to mankind more prominent than\nother religions.” The missionaries’ challenge to articulate\nboth a personal and a corporate, social ethic roused the Buddhists to\nestablish schools, hospitals, and various kinds of chaplaincies. \n\nThe Japanese Buddhist response to modernity from the beginning of the\ntwentieth century tended to be dominated by two interrelated trends:\nthe attempt to reinterpret the nature of the Buddhist and Christian\ntraditions and the relationship between them, and the attempt to\nmodernize Buddhist teachings by adopting modes of understanding\nreligious life discerned in Western thought and Christian conceptual\nmotifs. \n\n Until the latter half of the\nnineteenth century, there were no terms in Japanese corresponding to\nthe abstract categories of “philosophy” and\n“religion.” Nevertheless, the study of Western philosophy\nbegan to be diligently pursued, even before the Meiji restoration, as\nan important body of Western learning crucial for modern Japan, an\naccompaniment to the natural sciences. The accepted term corresponding\nto “religion,” shūkyō宗教,\ncame into use as the standard equivalent for the Western concept from\nthe 1860’s, when it was required for the translation of\ndiplomatic documents exchanged with Western nations. In terms of actual\ncontent, therefore, it was at first closely associated with\nChristianity. \n\n For Buddhists, philosophy and\nreligion became a means not only to position Buddhism in relation to\nChristianity, but also to distance it from Christianity to its own\nadvantage, particularly in relation to modern scientific knowledge. The\ncentral figure here was Inoue Enryō (1858-1919), who was born into\nthe family of a Pure Land temple priest of the Shin Buddhist tradition\nand was active throughout his life as an educator and public\nintellectual. \n\n Inoue’s strategy was to\nview Buddhism as a religion in the mode of a philosophy. He employed\nboth categories in characterizing the aims and approach of Buddhism,\nseeking to demonstrate its superiority to Christianity. On the one\nhand, Buddhism shares the core concern of all religion, which is\n“the world of the absolute” (zettai sekai):\n“Religion teaches the way for our relative mind to enter into the\nabsolute world. In Buddhism, this is namely the overturning of\ndelusional thought and the awakening of enlightenment. Delusional\nthought indicates the finite, while enlightenment signifies the\ninfinite (Meishin to Shūkyō [Superstition and\nReligion], 1916, quoted in Josephson 2012, p. 159). On the other hand,\nwhen the superstitious practices that have attached themselves to\nBuddhist life are stripped away, its fundamental mode of thought,\nrooted in reason and causality, is seen to resemble scientific and\nphilosophical thought. In this, it is distinct from Christianity, which\nInoue believes is grounded in revelation and divine creation. To\ncounter the notion of creationism that Gordon proposed as the\nfoundation of genuine religion, Japanese Buddhists drew on the Western\nscience of evolution as the razor that would shear superstition from a\nmore properly “philosophical” version of religion. \n\n Inoue draws on concepts and\nframeworks that were current in the West in the field of\n“comparative religion” or the “scientific study of\nreligion.” Max Müller, whose thinking informed the spirit of\nthe World’s Parliament of Religions in which a number of Japanese\nBuddhists participated, speaks of a human faith in the infinite or\nabsolute within the historical world, and of the “struggle to\nconceive the inconceivable” (Introduction to the Science of\nReligions, 1870, quoted in Ketelaar 1990, p. 146). This language\nwas seen to resonate with the Buddhist tradition, providing it with\nbroad categories by which Japanese Buddhists were able to situate their\ntraditions in modern, philosophically recognizable frameworks. \n\n The aforementioned M. L. Gordon\nhad claimed that an experiential conversion—“a deep\npersonal loathing of sin” or awareness of “a certain and\npresent forgiveness of sin”—is the hallmark of the\ngenuinely religious. That conversion experience, he maintained, lends\nChristianity a power lacking in Japanese Buddhism, which he saw as\nmoribund and widely discredited in modern times. Admittedly, the\nChristian concepts of sin and forgiveness are absent from Pure Land\nBuddhism. Yet, some Buddhist thinkers felt challenged to develop the\npractical dimension of the Pure Land tradition, even while adopting\nInoue’s philosophical terminology. They accepted the Christian\ncritique, acknowledging the Christian strength as indispensible for, in\nGordon’s expression, “a living religion.” \n\n The representative Japanese\nBuddhist figure here is the Pure Land priest Kiyozawa Manshi\n(1863-1903), a younger associate of Inoue who had also studied Western\nphilosophy at Tokyo Imperial University. Despite his early death,\nKiyozawa’s efforts to democratize and modernize the Shin Buddhist\ntemple institution deeply influenced succeeding thinkers of the Higashi\nHonganji tradition. Like Inoue, he speaks of the finite and infinite\n(or absolute) as mediated by reason in philosophy and by faith in\nreligion. Kiyozawa is distinctive, though, in his decidedly practical\norientation, exploring the encounter with the absolute in religious\nlife. In his late twenties, he undertook an ascetic discipline of daily\nlife and diet that ended after several years when he contracted\ntuberculosis. In the last five years of his life, he was strongly\nattracted to the introspective spiritual cultivation of equanimity and\nindifference to contingencies that he found in the early scriptures of\nBuddhism and especially in the Stoic philosopher Epictetus. \n\n Although Kiyozawa makes little\nmention of Christianity in his writings beyond, for example,\nreflections on the doctrines of creation or monotheism from a\ncomparative philosophical perspective, we find in his journal in 1898,\namid passages from Epictetus and other classical texts, references to\nbiblical passages in standard English notation. In relation to the\nnotion “God is in man,” which he considers “an old\ndoctrine” found in classical Western authors, Kiyozawa gives\nreferences to five Bible passages, including: “Do you not know\nthat your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom\nyou have received from God?” (I Cor. 6:19); “Guard the good\ndeposit that was entrusted to you—guard it with the help of the\nHoly Spirit who lives in us” (2 Tim. 1:4); “No one has ever\nseen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us … He has\ngiven us of his Spirit” (I John 3:12–13). \n\n The references suggest a close\nfamiliarity with the Bible, probably from his youth. Although Kiyozawa\nmakes no reference to Christianity itself in this context, in his\npursuit of immediate experience, in his probing self-examination, and\nin his works for institutional and educational reform, he appears\nalmost to embody a Buddhist response to Gordon’s accusation that\nBuddhism lacks the power to influence daily life and ethical social\naction. Toward the end of his life, Kiyozawa created a Buddhist\nmovement for the quest of “spiritual living”\n(seishin-shugi), which he defines in terms of the personal\nencounter with the absolute. \n\n In Kiyozawa’s disciple\nSoga Ryōjin (1875-1971), also a Shin Buddhist priest, we find the\nsame interest in articulating the personal immediacy of religious\nteachings. Instead of seeking, like his teacher, to build on the\nlegitimacy of philosophy and science, carving out a place for Buddhism\nbeyond the limitations of a rational philosophical analysis of life\nexperience, Soga stood within Shin Buddhist teachings and sought to\nshow their vital significance. He did so by drawing on broader Mahayana\nBuddhist concepts, comparing them at times with Christian modes of\nthought. \n\n In an article for fellow\nmissionaries explaining Amida Buddha and the Pure Land, Gordon quotes\nRhys Davids in characterizing them as “hypothetical beings, the\ncreations of a sickly scholasticism, hollow abstractions without life\nor reality” (“The Legend of Amida”). In the 1880s,\nChristian missionaries undoubtedly felt confident that to expose Pure\nLand teachings as “tales” unknown to Gotama would lead to\nthe dismantling of “the most powerful sect in Japan.” Pure\nLand Buddhists were keenly aware of such criticism, and it may have\nprompted Soga and others to ponder Christian ideas in exploring the\nexistential, religious meaning of Pure Land teachings. While temple\ninstitutions had pursued the study of Christian theology for polemical\npurposes, it appears that by the turn of the twentieth century, some\nBuddhist philosophers had gained a new confidence of their own,\nallowing themselves to be stimulated by Christian theological\nideas. \n\nIn one of his seminal essays, “Savior on Earth,” Soga\nbegins: \n\nThis essay was published in 1913 in the magazine begun by Kiyozawa,\nSeishinkai (The World of Spiritual Living), fifteen years\nafter Kiyozawa’s journal references to the Bible quoted above.\nAlthough Soga is spoken of as “arguably the most innovative\nthinker in modern Shin Buddhist history” by sectarian scholars,\nand although he employs the traditional Shin term “directed [by\nAmida]” (ekō) in speaking of the source of his\n“revelation,” it is highly likely that Soga had been\ntesting how Christian ideas might help in developing Shin teachings.\nThe term “savior” (kyūshu) in Soga’s\ntitle is widely used for Christ, and in comparative remarks in the\nessay, Soga asserts that the unique incarnation as Jesus limits\nGod’s salvific power to Jesus personally, while Dharmakara is\nborn in each person and becomes “the true subjectivity of the\nself in the desire for salvation.” \n\n Soga not only counters\ncriticisms that Amida is merely mythical and that Pure Land Buddhism\nlacks historical foundations, but also strongly affirms in doctrinal\nterms the immediacy of personal religious experience in Shin. Christian\nconcepts related to kenosis, incarnation in historical time, and\ntrinity may have stimulated Soga’s rethinking of the relationship\nbetween the practitioner and Amida. There is also the matter of the\ntemporal dimension in this relationship. Previously the Japanese Pure\nLand tradition had articulated the Mahayana logic of the nonduality of\nthe temporal and the uncreated (or transtemporal). That said, the\nChristian critique and Augustinian concepts of time and eternity may\nalso have inspired Soga’s interpretation of the vast time spans\nin the narrative of Dharmakara’s vows and practice. As Soga\nexplains: \n\nThe philosopher Nishitani Keiji (1900-1990) also articulates\nShinran’s treatment of time in terms of the nondiscrimination or\nsimultaneity of the temporal and the timeless or eternal (Nishitani\n1978). \n\nChristianity challenged Japanese Buddhists by teaching a personal\nreligiosity and a stringent individual moral responsibility. Kiyozawa\noffers a prominent example of the attempt to engage those\nissues. Regarding the narrative of the origin of Amida Buddha and the\nPure Land, which Gordon and other Christian missionaries regarded as\nobvious fictions created late in the Buddhist tradition, Soga may have\nfound resources for resolution in the very Christian sources behind\nthe criticisms. The Japanese Mahayana tradition had already developed\nit own concepts of the compassionate emergence out of emptiness or\nformless reality as well as the nonduality of the karmically\nconditioned and unconditioned. Those ideas provided an openness to and\npoint of entry into certain areas of Christian and Western\nphilosophical thought. During the twentieth century, philosophers such\nas Nishida Kitarō, Tanabe Hajime, Nishitani Keiji, Takeuchi\nYoshinori, and Abe Masao have drawn on both the Christian and Japanese\nBuddhist traditions, particularly Pure Land and Zen, in engaging\nmodern philosophical issues.","contact.mail":"hirota.dennis@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
