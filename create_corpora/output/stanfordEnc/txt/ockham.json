He is probably best known\ntoday for his espousal of metaphysical nominalism; indeed, the\nmethodological principle known as “Ockham’s Razor”\nis named after him. But Ockham held important, often influential views\nnot only in metaphysics but also in all other major areas of medieval\nphilosophy—logic, physics or natural philosophy, theory of\nknowledge, ethics, and political philosophy—as well as in\ntheology. \n\nOckham led an unusually eventful life for a philosopher. As with so\nmany medieval figures who were not prominent when they were born, we\nknow next to nothing about the circumstances of Ockham’s birth\nand early years, and have to estimate dates by extrapolating from\nknown dates of events later in his\n life.[1] \nOckham’s life may be divided into three main periods. \nOckham was born, probably in late 1287 or early 1288, in the village\nof Ockham (= Oak Hamlet) in Surrey, a little to the southwest of\n London.[2]\n He probably learned basic Latin at a village school in Ockham or\nnearby, but this is not\n certain.[3]\n At an early age, somewhere between seven and thirteen, Ockham was\n“given” to the Franciscan order (the so called\n “Greyfriars”).[4]\n There was no Franciscan house (called a “convent”) in the\ntiny village of Ockham itself; the nearest one was in London, a\nday’s ride to the northeast. It was there that Ockham was\nsent. \nAs an educational institution, even for higher education, London\nGreyfriars was a distinguished place; at the time, it was second only\nto the full-fledged Universities of Paris and Oxford. At Greyfriars,\nOckham probably got most of his “grade school” education,\nand then went on to what we might think of as “high\nschool” education in basic logic and “science”\n(natural philosophy), beginning around the age of fourteen. \nAround 1310, when he was about 23, Ockham began his theological\ntraining. It is not certain where this training occurred. It could\nwell have been at the London Convent, or it could have been at Oxford,\nwhere there was another Franciscan convent associated with the\nuniversity. In any event, Ockham was at Oxford studying theology by at\nleast the year 1318–19, and probably the previous year as well,\nwhen (in 1317) he began a required two-year cycle of lectures\ncommenting on Peter Lombard’s Sentences, the standard\ntheological textbook of the day. Then, probably in 1321, Ockham\nreturned to London Greyfriars, where he remained. Although he had\ntaken the initial steps in the theology program at Oxford (hence his\noccasional nickname, the Venerabilis Inceptor,\n“Venerable Beginner”), Ockham did not complete the program\nthere, and never became a fully qualified “master” of\ntheology at Oxford. Nevertheless, London Greyfriars was an\nintellectually lively place, and Ockham was by no means isolated from\nthe heat of academic controversy. Among his “housemates”\nwere two other important Franciscan thinkers of the day, Walter\nChatton and Adam Wodeham, both sharp critics of Ockham’s views.\nIt was in this context that Ockham wrote many of his most important\nphilosophical and theological works. \nIn 1323 Ockham was called before the Franciscan province’s\nchapter meeting, held that year in Bristol, to defend his views, which\nwere regarded with suspicion by some of his confreres. About the same\ntime, someone—it is not clear who—went from England to the\nPapal court at Avignon and charged Ockham with teaching\n heresy.[5]\n As a result, a commission of theologians was set up to study the\ncase. Ockham was called to Avignon in May, 1324, to answer the\ncharges. He never went back to England. \nWhile in Avignon, Ockham stayed at the Franciscan convent there. It\nhas sometimes been suggested that he was effectively under\n“house arrest,” but this seems an exaggeration. On the\ncontrary, he appears to have been free to do more or less as he\npleased, although of course he did have to be “on hand” in\ncase the investigating commission wanted to question him about his\nwritings. The investigation must not have demanded much of\nOckham’s own time, since he was able to work on a number of\nother projects while he was in Avignon, including finishing his last\nmajor theological work, the Quodlibets. It should be pointed\nout that, although there were some stern pronouncements that came out\nof the investigation of Ockham, his views were never officially\ncondemned as heretical. \nIn 1327, Michael of Cesena, the Franciscan “Minister\nGeneral” (the chief administrative officer of the order)\nlikewise came to Avignon, in his case because of an emerging\ncontroversy between the Franciscans and the current Pope, John XXII,\nover the idea of “Apostolic poverty,” the view that Jesus\nand the Apostles owned no property at all of their own but, like the\nmendicant Franciscans, went around begging and living off the\ngenerosity of others. The Franciscans held this view, and maintained\nthat their own practices were a special form of “imitation of\nChrist.” Pope John XXII rejected the doctrine, which is why\nMichael of Cesena was in Avignon. \nThings came to a real crisis in 1328, when Michael and the Pope had a\nserious confrontation over the matter. As a result, Michael asked\nOckham to study the question from the point of view of previous papal\nstatements and John’s own previous writings on the subject. When\nhe did so, Ockham came to the conclusion, apparently somewhat to his\nown surprise, that John’s view was not only wrong but outright\nheretical. Furthermore, the heresy was not just an honest mistake; it\nwas stubbornly heretical, a view John maintained even\nafter he had been shown it was wrong. As a result, Ockham argued,\nPope John was not just teaching heresy, but was a heretic himself in\nthe strongest possible sense, and had therefore effectively abdicated\nhis papacy. In short, Pope John XXII was no pope at all! \nClearly, things had become intolerable for Ockham in Avignon. \nUnder cover of darkness the night of May 26, 1328, Michael of Cesena,\nOckham, and a few other sympathetic Franciscans fled Avignon and went\ninto exile. They initially went to Italy, where Louis (Ludwig) of\nBavaria, the Holy Roman Emperor, was in Pisa at the time, along with\nhis court and retinue. The Holy Roman Emperor was engaged in a\npolitical dispute with the Papacy, and Ockham’s group found\nrefuge under his protection. On June 6, 1328, Ockham was officially\nexcommunicated for leaving Avignon without\n permission.[6]\n Around 1329, Louis returned to Munich, together with Michael, Ockham\nand the rest of their fugitive band. Ockham stayed there, or at any\nrate in areas under Imperial control, until his death. During this\ntime, Ockham wrote exclusively on political\n matters.[7]\n He died on the night of April 9/10, 1347, at roughly the age of\n sixty.[8] \nOckham’s writings are conventionally divided into two groups:\nthe so called “academic” writings and the\n“political” ones. By and large, the former were written or\nat least begun while Ockham was still in England, while the latter\nwere written toward the end of Ockham’s Avignon period and\nlater, in\n exile.[9]\n With the exception of his Dialogue, a huge political work,\nall are now available in modern critical editions, and many are now\ntranslated into English, in whole or in\n part.[10]\n The academic writings are in turn divided into two groups: the\n“theological” works and the “philosophical”\nones, although both groups are essential for any study of\nOckham’s philosophy. \nAmong Ockham’s most important writings are: \nSeveral lesser items are omitted from the above list. \nOckham is rightly regarded as one of the most significant logicians of\nthe Middle Ages. Nevertheless, his originality and influence should\nnot be exaggerated. For all his deserved reputation, his logical views\nare sometimes\n derivative[11]\n and occasionally very\n idiosyncratic.[12] \nLogic, for Ockham, is crucial to the advancement of knowledge. In the\n“Prefatory Letter” to his Summa of Logic, for\nexample, he praises it in striking language: \nOckham’s main logical writings consist of a series of\ncommentaries (or “expositions”) on Aristotle’s and\nPorphyry’s logical works, plus his own Summa of Logic,\nhis major work in the field. His Treatise on Predestination\ncontains an influential theory on the logic of future contingent\npropositions, and other works as well include occasional discussions\nof logical topics, notably his Quodlibets. \nOckham’s Summa of Logic is divided into three parts,\nwith the third part subdivided into four subparts. Part I divides\nlanguage, in accordance with Aristotle’s On\nInterpretation (1, 16a3–8, as influenced by\nBoethius’s interpretation), into written, spoken and mental\nlanguage, with the written kind dependent on the spoken, and the\nspoken on mental language. Mental language, the language of thought,\nis thus the most primitive and basic level of language. Part I goes on\nto lay out a fairly detailed theory of terms, including the\ndistinctions between (a) categorematic and syncategorematic terms, (b)\nabstract and concrete terms, and (c) absolute and connotative terms.\nPart I then concludes with a discussion of the five\n“predicables” from Porphyry’s Isagoge and\nof each of Aristotle’s categories. \nWhile Part I is about terms, Part II is about\n“propositions,” which are made up of terms. Part II gives\na systematic and nuanced theory of truth conditions for the four\ntraditional kinds of assertoric categorical propositions on the\n“Square of Opposition,” and then goes on to tensed, modal\nand more complicated categorical propositions, as well as a variety of\n“hypothetical”\n (molecular[13])\n propositions. The vehicle for this account of truth conditions is the\nsemantic theory of “supposition,” which will be treated\nbelow. \nIf Part I is about terms and Part II about propositions made up of\nterms, Part III is about arguments, which are in turn made up of\npropositions made up of terms. It is divided into four subparts. Part\nIII.1 treats syllogisms, and includes a comprehensive theory of modal\n syllogistic.[14]\n Part III.2 concerns demonstrative syllogisms in particular. Part\nIII.3 is in effect Ockham’s theory of consequence, although it\nalso includes discussions of semantic paradoxes like the Liar (the so\ncalled insolubilia) and of the still little-understood\ndisputation form known as “obligation.” Part III.4 is a\ndiscussion of fallacies. \nThus, while the Summa of Logic is not in any sense a\n“commentary” on Aristotle’s logical writings, it\nnevertheless covers all the traditional ground in the traditional\norder: Porphyry’s Isagoge and Aristotle’s\nCategories in Part I, On Interpretation in Part II,\nPrior Analytics in Part III.1, Posterior Analytics\nin Part III.2, Topics (and much else) in Part III.3, and\nfinally Sophistic Refutations in Part III.4. \nPart I of the Summa of Logic also introduces a number of\nsemantic notions that play an important role throughout much of\nOckham’s philosophy. None of these notions is original with\nOckham, although he develops them with great sophistication and\nemploys them with skill. \nThe most basic such notion is “signification.” For the\nMiddle Ages, a term “signifies” what it makes us think\nof. This notion of signification was unanimously accepted;\nalthough there was great dispute over what terms signified,\nthere was agreement over the\n criterion.[15]\n Ockham, unlike many (but no means all) other medieval logicians, held\nthat terms do not in general signify thought, but can signify anything\nat all (including things not presently existing). The function of\nlanguage, therefore, is not so much to communicate thoughts from one\nmind to another, but to convey information about the\n world.[16] \nIn Summa of Logic I.33, Ockham acknowledges four different\nkinds of signification. In his first sense, a term signifies whatever\nthings it is truly predicable of by means of a present-tensed,\nassertoric copula. That is, a term t signifies a thing\nx if and only if ‘This is a t’ is true,\npointing to x. In the second sense, t signifies\nx if and only if ‘This is (or was, or will be, or can\nbe) a t’ is true, pointing to\n x.[17]\n These first two senses of signification are together called\n“primary” signification. \nIn the third sense, terms can also be said to signify certain things\nthey are not truly predicable of, no matter the tense or\nmodality of the copula. For instance, the word ‘brave’ not\nonly makes us think of brave people (whether presently existing or\nnot); it also makes us think of the bravery in virtue of\nwhich we call them “brave.” Thus, ‘brave’\nsignifies and is truly predicable of brave people, but also signifies\nbravery, even though it is not truly predicable of bravery. (Bravery\nis not brave.) This kind of signification is called\n“secondary” signification.\n To\n a first approximation, we can say that a “connotative”\nterm is just a term that has a secondary signification, and that such\na connotative term “connotes” exactly what it secondarily\nsignifies; in short, connotation is just secondary\n signification.[18]\n The fourth sense, finally, is the broadest one: according to it any\nlinguistic unit, including a whole sentence, can be said to signify\nwhatever things it makes us think of in some way or other. A sentence\nsignifies in this sense whatever it is that its terms primarily or\nsecondarily signify. \nThe theory of supposition was the centerpiece of late medieval\nsemantic theory. Supposition is not the same as signification. First\nof all, terms signify wherever we encounter them, whereas they have\nsupposition only in the context of a proposition. But the differences\ngo beyond that. Whereas signification is a psychological, cognitive\nrelation, the theory of supposition is, at least in part, a theory of\nreference. For Ockham, there are three main kinds of\n supposition[19]: \nPersonal supposition, which was the main focus, was divided into\nvarious subkinds, distinguished in terms of a theory of “descent\nto singulars” and “ascent from singulars.” A quick\nexample will give the flavor: In ‘Every dog is a mammal’,\n‘dog’ is said to have “confused and\ndistributive” personal supposition insofar as \nAlthough the mechanics of this part of supposition theory are well\nunderstood, in Ockham and in other authors, its exact purpose remains\nan open question. Although at first the theory looks like an account\nof truth conditions for quantified propositions, it will not work for\nthat purpose. And although the theory was sometimes used as an aid to\nspotting and analyzing fallacies, this was never done systematically\nand the theory is in any event ill suited for that\n purpose.[21] \nOckham was the first philosopher to develop in some detail the notion\nof “mental language” and to put it to work for him.\nAristotle, Boethius and several others had mentioned it before, but\nOckham’s innovation was to systematically transpose to the\nfine-grained analysis of human thought both the grammatical categories\nof his time, such as those of noun, verb, adverb, singular, plural and\nso on, and — even more importantly — the central\nsemantical ideas of signification, connotation and supposition\nintroduced in the previous\n section.[22]\n Written words for him are “subordinated” to spoken words,\nand spoken words in turn are “subordinated” to mental\nunits called “concepts”, which can be combined into\nsyntactically structured mental propositions, just as spoken and\nwritten words can be combined into audible or visible sentences. \nWhereas the signification of terms in spoken and written language is\npurely conventional and can be changed by mutual agreement (hence\nEnglish speakers say ‘dog’ whereas in French it is\nchien), the signification of mental terms is established by\nnature, according to Ockham, and cannot be changed at will. Concepts,\nin other words, are natural signs: my concept of dog\nnaturally signifies dogs. How this “natural signification”\nis to be accounted for in the final analysis for Ockham is not\nentirely clear, but it seems to be based both on the fact that simple\nconcepts are normally caused within the mind by their objects (my\nsimple concept of dog originated in me as an effect of my perceptual\nencounter with dogs), and on the fact that concepts are in some way\n“naturally similar” to their\n objects.[23] \nThis arrangement provides an account of synonymy and equivocation in\nspoken and written language. Two simple terms (whether from the same\nor different spoken or written languages) are synonymous if\nthey are ultimately subordinated to the same concept; a single given\nterm of spoken or written language is equivocal if it is\nultimately subordinated to more than one concept. \nThis raises an obvious question: Is there synonymy or equivocation in\nmental language itself? (If there is, it will obviously have to be\naccounted for in some other way than for spoken/written language.) A\ngreat deal of modern secondary literature has been devoted to this\nquestion. Trentman [1970] was the first to argue that no, there is no\nsynonymy or equivocation in mental language. On the contrary, mental\nlanguage for Ockham is a kind of lean, stripped down,\n“canonical” language with no frills or inessentials, a\nlittle like the “ideal languages” postulated by logical\natomists in the first part of the twentieth century. Spade [1980]\nlikewise argued in greater detail, on both theoretical and textual\ngrounds, that there is no synonymy or equivocation in mental language.\nMore recently, Panaccio [1990, 2004], Tweedale [1992] (both on largely\ntextual grounds), and Chalmers [1999] (on mainly theoretical grounds)\nhave argued for a different interpretation, which now tends to be more\nwidely accepted. What comes out at this point is that Ockham’s\nmental language is not to be seen as a logically ideal\nlanguage and that it does incorporate both some redundancies and some\nambiguities. \nThe question is complicated, but it goes to the heart of much of what\nOckham is up to. In order to see why, let us return briefly to the\ntheory of\n connotation.[24]\n Connotation was described\n above\n in terms of primary and secondary signification. But in Summa of\nLogic I.10, Ockham himself draws the distinction between absolute\nand connotative terms by means of the theory of definition. \nFor Ockham, there are two kinds of definitions: real\ndefinitions and nominal definitions. A real definition is\nsomehow supposed to reveal the essential metaphysical structure of\nwhat it defines; nominal definitions do not do that. As Ockham sets it\nup, all connotative terms have nominal definitions, never\nreal definitions, and absolute terms (although not all of\nthem) have real definitions, never nominal definitions. (Some absolute\nterms have no definitions at\n all.[25]) \nAs an example of a real definition, consider: ‘Man is a rational\nanimal’ or ‘Man is a substance composed of a body and an\nintellective soul’. Each of these traditional definitions is\ncorrect, and each in its own way expresses the essential metaphysical\nstructure of a human being. But notice: the two definitions do not\nsignify (make us think of) exactly the same things. The first\none makes us think of all rational things (in virtue of the first word\nof the definiens) plus all animals (whether rational or not, in virtue\nof the second word of the definiens). The second definition makes us\nthink of, among other things, all substances (in virtue of the word\n‘substance’ in the definiens), whereas the first one does\nnot. It follows therefore that an absolute term can have several\ndistinct real definitions that don’t always signify exactly the\nsame things. They will primarily signify—be truly\npredicable of—exactly the same things, since they will primarily\nsignify just what the term they define primarily signifies. But they\ncan also (secondarily) signify other things as\n well.[26] \nNominal definitions, Ockham says, are different: There is one and only\none nominal definition for any given connotative\n term.[27]\n While a real definition is expected to provide a structural\ndescription of certain things (which can be done in various ways, as\nwe just saw), a nominal definition, by contrast, is supposed to unfold\nin a precise way the signification of the connotative term it serves\nto define, and this can only be done, Ockham thinks, by explicitly\nmentioning, in the right order and with the right connections, which\nkind of things are primarily signified by this term and which are\nsecondarily signified. The nominal definition of the connotative term\n“brave”, to take a simple example, is “a living\nbeing endowed with bravery”; this reveals that\n“brave” primarily signifies certain living beings\n(referred to by the first part of the definition) and that it\nsecondarily signifies — or connotes — singular qualities\nof bravery (referred to by the last part of the\n definition).[28]\n Any non-equivalent nominal definition is bound to indicate a\ndifferent signification and would, consequently, be unsuitable if the\noriginal one was correct. \nNow, several commentators, following Trentman and Spade, concluded on\nthis basis that there are no simple connotative terms in\nOckham’s mental language. They reasoned as follows: a\nconnotative term is synonymous with its nominal definition, but there\nis no synonymy in mental language according to Ockham; mental\nlanguage, therefore, cannot contain both a simple connotative term and\nits complex nominal definition; since it must certainly have the\nresources for formulating adequate definitions, what must be dispensed\nwith is the defined simple term; and since all connotative\nterms are supposed to have a nominal definition, it follows that\nmental language contains only absolute terms (along with\nsyncategorematic ones, of course). It even came to be supposed in this\nline of interpretation, that the very central point of Ockham’s\nnominalist program was to show that if anything can be truly said\nabout the world, it can be said using only absolute and\nsyncategorematic terms, and that this is precisely what happens in\nmental language. \nThe consequences were far-reaching. Not only did this interpretation\nclaim to provide an overall understanding of what Ockham was up to,\nbut it also inevitably led to conclude that his whole nominalist\nprogram was bound to failure. All relational terms, indeed, are taken\nto be connotative terms in Ockham’s semantics. The program,\nconsequently, was thought to require the semantical reduction of all\nrelational terms to combinations of non-relational ones, which seems\nhardly possible. Thus, the question whether there are simple\nconnotative terms or not in Ockham’s mental language is crucial\nto our understanding of the success of his overall ontological\nproject. Since spoken and written languages are semantically\nderivative on mental language, it is vital that we get the semantics\nof mental language to work out right for Ockham, or else the\nsystematic coherence of much of what he has to say will be in\njeopardy. \nIn view of recent scholarship, though, it appears highly doubtful that\nOckham’s purpose really was to use nominal definitions to\neliminate all simple connotative terms from mental language. For one\nthing, as Spade had remarked himself, Ockham never systematically\nengages in explicit attempts at such semantical reductions, which\nwould be quite odd if this was the central component of his\nnominalism. Furthermore it was shown that Ockham did in fact hold that\nthere are simple connotative terms in mental language. He\nsays it explicitly and repeatedly, and in a variety of texts from his\nearlier to his later philosophical and theological\n writings.[29]\n The secondary literature, consequently, has now gradually converged\non the view that, for Ockham, there is no synonymy among\nsimple terms in mental language, but that there can be some\nredundancy between simple terms and complex expressions, or between\nvarious complex expressions. If so, nothing prevents a simple\nconnotative concept to coexist in mental language with its nominal\ndefinition. \nOckham indeed explicitly denies that a complex definition is\nin general wholly synonymous with the corresponding defined\n term.[30]\n His point, presumably, is that the definition usually signifies\nmore things than the defined term. Take “brave”\nagain. Its definition, remember, is “a living being endowed with\nbravery”. Now, the first part of this complex expression makes\nus think of all living beings, whereas the simple term\n“brave” has only the brave ones as its primary\nsignificates and does not signify in any way the non-brave living\nbeings. This shows in effect that simple connotative terms are not\n— at least not always — shorthand abbreviations for their\nnominal definitions in Ockham’s view. And it must be conjectured\nthat some simple connotative concepts can be directly\nacquired on the basis of perceptual experiences, just as absolute ones\nare supposed to be (think of a relational concept like “taller\nthan” or a qualitative one like “white”). \nOckham’s nominal definitions, then, should not be seen as\nreductionist devices for eliminating certain terms, but as a\nprivileged means for making conspicuous what the (primary and\nsecondary) significates of the defined terms are. The main point here\nis that such definitions, when correctly formulated, explicitly reveal\nthe ontological commitments associated with the normal use of the\ndefined terms. The definition of “brave” as “a\nliving being endowed with bravery”, for example, shows that the\ncorrect use of the term “brave” commits us only to the\nexistence of singular living beings and singular braveries.\nOckham’s nominalism does not require the elimination of simple\nconnotative concepts after all; its main relevant thesis, on the\ncontrary, is that their use is ontologically harmless since they do\nnot signify (either primarily or secondarily) anything but individual\nthings, as their nominal definitions are supposed to make it\nclear. \nOckham was a nominalist, indeed he is the person whose name is perhaps\nmost famously associated with nominalism. But nominalism means many\ndifferent things: \nThe first two kinds of nominalism listed above are independent of one\nanother. Historically, there have been philosophers who denied\nmetaphysical universals, but allowed (individual) entities in more\nontological categories than Ockham does. Conversely, one might reduce\nthe number of ontological categories, and yet hold that universal\nentities are needed in the categories that remain. \nStill, Ockham’s “nominalism,” in both the first and\nthe second of the above senses, is often viewed as derived from a\ncommon source: an underlying concern for ontological parsimony. This\nis summed up in the famous slogan known as “Ockham’s\nRazor,” often expressed as “Don’t multiply entities\nbeyond\n necessity.”[31]\n Although the sentiment is certainly Ockham’s, that particular\nformulation is nowhere to be found in his texts. Moreover, as usually\nstated, it is a sentiment that virtually all philosophers,\nmedieval or otherwise, would accept; no one wants a needlessly bloated\nontology. The question, of course, is which entities are needed and\nwhich are not. \nOckham’s Razor, in the senses in which it can be found in Ockham\nhimself, never allows us to deny putative entities; at best\nit allows us to refrain from positing them in the absence of known\ncompelling reasons for doing so. In part, this is because human beings\ncan never be sure they know what is and what is not “beyond\nnecessity”; the necessities are not always clear to us. But even\nif we did know them, Ockham would still not allow that his Razor\nallows us to deny entities that are unnecessary. For Ockham,\nthe only truly necessary entity is God; everything else, the whole of\ncreation, is radically contingent through and through. In short,\nOckham does not accept the Principle of Sufficient Reason. \nNevertheless, we do sometimes have sufficient methodological grounds\nfor positively affirming the existence of certain things. Ockham\nacknowledges three sources for such grounds (three sources of positive\nknowledge). As he says in Sent. I, dist. 30, q. 1: “For\nnothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is\nself-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by\nexperience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture.” \nIn the case of universal entities, Ockham’s nominalism is\nnot based on his Razor, his principle of parsimony. That is,\nOckham does not hold merely that there is no good reason for affirming\nuniversals, so that we should refrain from doing so in the absence of\nfurther evidence. No, he holds that theories of universals, or at\nleast the theories he considers, are outright incoherent; they either\nare self-contradictory or at least violate certain other things we\nknow are true in virtue of the three sources just cited. For Ockham,\nthe only universal entities it makes sense to talk about are universal\nconcepts, and derivative on them, universal terms in spoken and\nwritten language. Metaphysically, these “universal”\nconcepts are singular entities like all others; they are\n“universal” only in the sense of being “predicable\nof many.” \nWith respect to the exact ontological status of such conceptual\nentities, however, Ockham changed his view over the course of his\ncareer. To begin with, he adopted what is known as the\nfictum-theory, a theory according to which universals have no\n“real” existence at all in the Aristotelian categories,\nbut instead are purely “intentional objects” with a\nspecial mode of existence; they have only a kind of\n“thought”-reality. Eventually, however, Ockham came to\nthink this intentional realm of “fictive” entities was not\nneeded, and by the time of his Summa of Logic and the\nQuodlibets adopts instead a so called\nintellectio-theory, according to which a universal concept is\njust the act of thinking about several objects at once; metaphysically\nsuch an “act” is a singular quality of an individual mind,\nand is “universal” only in the sense of being a mental\nsign of several things at once and being predicable of them in mental\n propositions.[32] \nThus, Ockham is quite certain there are no metaphysically universal\nentities. But when it comes to paring down the number of basic\nontological categories, he is more cautious, and it is there that he\nuses his Razor ruthlessly—always to suspend judgment, never to\ndeny. \nThe main vehicle for this “ontological reduction” is the\ntheory of connotation, coupled with the related theory of\n“exposition.” The theory of exposition, which is not fully\ndeveloped in Ockham, will become increasingly prominent in authors\nimmediately after him. In effect, the theory of connotation is related\nto the theory of exposition as explicit definition is related to\ncontextual definition. The notion of the “square” of a\nnumber can be explicitly defined, for example, as the result of\nmultiplying that number by itself. Contextual definition operates not\nat the level of terms, but at the level of propositions. Thus,\nBertrand Russell famously treated ‘The present king of France is\nbald’ as amounting to ‘There is an x such that\nx is a present king of France and x is bald, and for\nall y if y is a present king of France then\ny = x’. We are never given any outright\ndefinition of the term ‘present king of France’, but\ninstead are given a technique of paraphrasing away seemingly\nreferential occurrences of that term in such a way that we are not\ncommitted to any actually existing present kings of France. So too,\nOckham tries to provide us, at the propositional level, with\nparaphrases of propositions that seem at first to refer to entities he\nsees no reason to believe\n in.[33] \nFor example, in Summa of Logic, II.11, among other places,\nOckham argues that we can account for the truth of ‘Socrates is\nsimilar to Plato’ without having to appeal to a relational\nentity called “similarity”: \n\n In\n this way, Ockham removes all need for entities in seven of the\ntraditional Aristotelian ten categories; all that remain are entities\nin the categories of substance and quality, and a few entities in the\ncategory of relation, which Ockham thinks are required for theological\nreasons pertaining to the Trinity, the Incarnation and the Eucharist,\neven though our natural cognitive powers would see no reason for them\nat\n all.[34]\n As is to be expected, the ultimate success of Ockham’s program\nis a matter of considerable\n dispute.[35] \nIt should be stressed again, however, that this program in no way\nrequires that it should be possible to dispense altogether with terms\nfrom any of the ten Aristotelian categories (relational and\nquantitative terms in particular). Ockham’s claim is simply that\nall our basic scientific terms, whether absolute or connotative,\nsignify nothing but singular substances or qualities (plus some\nsingular relations in certain exceptional theological cases). \nOckham’s “physics” or natural philosophy is of a\nbroadly Aristotelian sort, although he interprets Aristotle in his own\nfashion. Ockham wrote a great deal in this area; indeed his\nExposition of Aristotle’s Physics is his longest work\nexcept for his Commentary on the\n Sentences.[36] \nAs a nominalist about universals, Ockham had to deal with the\nAristotelian claim in the Posterior Analytics that science\npertains to certain propositions about what is universal and\nnecessary. He discusses this issue in the Prologue to his\nExposition of the\n Physics,[37]\n and there agrees with Aristotle. But he interprets Aristotle’s\ndictum as saying that knowledge bears upon certain propositions with\ngeneral (universal) terms in them; it is only in that sense that\nscience deals with the universal. This of course does not mean that\nfor Ockham our scientific knowledge can never get beyond the level of\nlanguage to actual things. He distinguishes various senses of\n‘to know’ (scire, from which we get\nscientia or “science”): \nAs described\n earlier,\n Ockham holds that we do not need to allow special entities in all ten\nof Aristotle’s categories. In particular, we do not need them in\nthe category of quantity. For Ockham, there is no need for real\n“mathematical” entities such as numbers, points, lines,\nand surfaces as distinct from individual substances and qualities.\nApparent talk about such things can invariably be parsed away, via the\ntheory of connotation or exposition, in favor of talk about substances\nand qualities (and, in certain theological contexts, a few relations).\nThis Ockhamist move is illustrative of and influential on an important\ndevelopment in late medieval physics: the application of mathematics\nto non-mathematical things, culminating in Galileo’s famous\nstatement that the “book of nature” is written in the\n“language of mathematics.” \nSuch an application of mathematics violates a traditional Aristotelian\nprohibition against metabasis eis allo genos, grounded on\nquite reasonable considerations. The basic idea is that things cannot\nbe legitimately compared in any respect in which they differ in\nspecies. Thus it makes little sense to ask whether the soprano’s\nhigh C is higher or lower than Mount Everest—much less to ask\n(quantitatively) how much higher or lower it is. But for\nAristotle, straight lines and curved lines belong to different species\nof lines. Hence they cannot be meaningfully compared or measured\nagainst one another. The same holds for rectilinear motion and\ncircular motion.  \nAlthough the basic idea is reasonable enough, Ockham recognized that\nthere are problems. The length of a coiled rope, for example, can\nstraightforwardly be compared to the length of an uncoiled rope, and\nthe one can meaningfully be said to be longer or shorter than, or\nequal in length to, the other. For that matter, a single rope\nsurely stays the same length, whether it is coiled or extended\nfull-length. Ockham’s solution to these problems is to note\nthat, on his ontology, straight lines and curved lines are not\nreally different species of lines—because lines are not\nextra things in the first place. Talk about lines is simply a\n“manner of speaking” about substances and qualities. \nThus, to compare a “curved” (coiled) rope with a\n“straight” (uncoiled) one is not really to talk about the\nlengths of lines in two different species; it is to talk about two\nropes. To describe the one as curved (coiled) and the other\nas straight (uncoiled) is not to appeal to specifically different\nkinds of entities—curvature and straightness—but merely to\ndescribe the ropes in ways that can be expounded according to two\ndifferent patterns. Since such talk does not have ontological\nimplications that require specifically different kinds of entities,\nthe Aristotelian prohibition of metabasis does not apply. \nOnce one realizes that we can appeal to connotation theory, and more\ngenerally the theory of exposition, without invoking new entities, the\ndoor is opened to applying mathematical analyses (all of which are\nexponible, for Ockham) to all kinds of things, and in particular to\nphysical nature. \nOckham’s contributions were by no means the only factor in the\nincreasing mathematization of science in the fourteenth century. But\nthey were important\n ones.[38] \nLike most medieval accounts of knowledge, Ockham’s is not much\nconcerned with answering skeptical doubts. He takes it for granted\nthat humans not only can but frequently do know things, and focuses\nhis attention instead on the “mechanisms” by which this\nknowledge comes about. \nOckham’s theory of knowledge, like his natural philosophy, is\nbroadly Aristotelian in form, although—again, like his natural\nphilosophy—it is “Aristotelian” in its own way. For\nmost Aristotelians of the day, knowledge involved the transmission of\na\n “species”[39]\n between the object and the mind. At the sensory level, this species\nmay be compared to the more recent notion of a sense\n“impression.” More generally, we can think of it as the\nstructure or configuration of the object, a structure or configuration\nthat can be “encoded” in different ways and found\nisomorphically in a variety of contexts. One recent author, describing\nthe theory as it occurs in Aquinas, puts it like\n this:[40] \nThe configuration of features found in the external object is also\nfound in “encoded” form as a species in the organ that\nsenses the object. (Depending on the sense modality, it may also be\nfound in an intervening medium. For example, with vision and hearing,\nthe species is transmitted through the air to the sense organ.) At the\nintellectual level, the so called “agent intellect” goes\nto work on this species and somehow produces the universal concept\nthat is the raw material of intellectual\n cognition.[41] \nOckham rejected this entire theory of species. For him, species are\nunnecessary to a successful theory of cognition, and he dispenses with\n them.[42]\n Moreover, he argues, the species theory is not supported by\nexperience; introspection reveals no such species in our cognitive\n processes.[43]\n This rejection of the species theory of cognition, which had been\nforeshadowed by several previous authors (such as Henry of Ghent in\nthe thirteenth century), was an important development in late medieval\n epistemology.[44] \nOne of the more intriguing features of late medieval epistemology in\ngeneral, and of Ockham’s view in particular, is the development\nof a theory known as “intuitive and abstractive\ncognition.” The theory is found in authors as diverse as Duns\nScotus, Peter Auriol, Walter Chatton, and Ockham. But their theories\nof intuitive and abstractive cognition are so different that it is\nhard to see any one thing they are all supposed to be theories of.\nNevertheless, to a first approximation, intuitive cognition can be\nthought of as perception, whereas abstractive cognition is closer to\nimagination or remembering. The fit is not exact, however, since\nauthors who had a theory of intuitive and abstractive cognition\nusually also allowed the distinction at the intellectual\nlevel as well. \nIt is important to note that abstractive cognition, in the sense of\nthis theory, has nothing necessarily to do with\n“abstraction” in the sense of producing universal concepts\nfrom cognitive encounters with individuals. Instead, what abstractive\ncognition “abstracts” from is the question of the\nexistence or non-existence of the object. By contrast,\nintuitive cognition is very much tied up with the existence or\nnon-existence of the object. Here is how Ockham distinguishes\n them:[45] \nAbstractive cognition, however, is that by virtue of which it cannot\nbe evidently known of the thing whether it exists or does not exist.\nAnd in this way abstractive cognition, as opposed to intuitive\ncognition, “abstracts” from existence and non-existence,\nbecause by it neither can it be evidently known of an existing thing\nthat it exists, nor of a non-existent one that it does not exist. \nOckham’s main point here is that an intuitive cognition\nnaturally causes in the mind a number of true\ncontingent judgements about the external thing(s) that caused\nthis intuitive cognition; for example, that this thing exists, or that\nit is white, and so on. This does not prevent God from deceiving any\nparticular creature if He wants to, even when an intuitive cognition\nis present, but in such a case, God would have to neutralize the\nnatural causal effect of this intuitive cognition (this is something\nHe can always do, according to Ockham) and directly cause instead a\nfalse judgement. Intuitive cognitions, on the other hand, can\nsometimes induce false beliefs, too, if the circumstances are abnormal\n(in cases of perceptual illusions in particular), but even then, they\nwould still cause some true contingent judgements. The latter at any\nrate is their distinctive feature. Abstractive cognitions, by\ncontrast, are not such as to naturally cause true judgements about\ncontingent\n matters.[46] \nOckham’s ethics combines a number of themes. For one, it is a\nwill-based ethics in which intentions count for everything\nand external behavior or actions count for nothing. In themselves, all\nactions are morally neutral. \nAgain, there is a strong dose of divine command theory in\nOckham’s ethics. Certain things (i.e., in light of the previous\npoint, certain intentions) becomes morally obligatory,\npermitted or forbidden simply because God decrees so. Thus, in Exodus,\nthe Israelites’ “spoiling the Egyptians” (or rather\ntheir intention to do so, which they carried out) was not a\nmatter of theft or plunder, but was morally permissible and indeed\nobligatory—because God had commanded it. \nNevertheless, despite the divine command themes in Ockham’s\nethics, it is also clear that he wanted morality to be to some extent\na matter of reason. There is even a sense in which one can find a kind\nof natural law theory in Ockham’s ethics; one way in which God\nconveys his divine commands to us is by giving us the natures we\n have.[47]\n Unlike Augustine, Ockham accepted the possibility of the\n“virtuous pagan”; moral virtue for Ockham does not depend\non having access to revelation. \nBut while moral virtue is possible even for the pagan, moral virtue is\nnot by itself enough for salvation. Salvation requires not just virtue\n(the opposite of which is moral vice) but merit (the opposite of which\nis sin), and merit requires grace, a free gift from God. In short,\nthere is no necessary connection between virtue—moral\ngoodness—and salvation. Ockham repeatedly emphasizes that\n“God is a debtor to no one”; he does not owe us\nanything, no matter what we do. \nFor Ockham, acts of will are morally virtuous either extrinsically,\ni.e. derivatively, through their conformity to some more fundamental\nact of will, or intrinsically. On pain of infinite regress, therefore,\nextrinsically virtuous acts of will must ultimately lead back to an\nintrinsically virtuous act of will. That intrinsically virtuous act of\nwill, for Ockham, is an act of “loving God above all else and\nfor his own sake.” \nIn his early work, On the Connection of the Virtues, Ockham\ndistinguishes five grades or stages of moral virtue, which have been\nthe topic of considerable speculation in the secondary\n literature:[48] \nThe difficulty in understanding this hierarchy comes at the fourth\nstage, where it is not clear exactly what moral factor is\nadded to the preceding three\n stages.[49] \nAt the beginning of his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle\nremarked that “the good is that at which all things aim.”\nEach thing, therefore, aims at the good, according to the demands of\nits nature. In the Middle Ages, “Aristotelians” like\nThomas Aquinas held that the good for human beings in particular is\n“happiness,” the enjoyment of the direct vision of God in\nthe next life. And, whether they realize it or not, that is what all\nhuman beings are ultimately aiming at in their actions. For someone\nlike Aquinas, therefore, the human will is “free” only in\na certain restricted sense. We are not free to choose for or\nagainst our final end; that is built into us by nature. But we are\nfree to choose various means to that end. All our choices,\ntherefore, are made under the aspect of leading to that final goal. To\nbe sure, sometimes we make the wrong choices, but when that occurs it\nis because of ignorance, distraction, self-deception, etc. In an\nimportant sense, then, someone like Aquinas accepts a version of the\nso called Socratic Paradox: No one knowingly and deliberately does\n evil.[50] \nOckham’s view is quite different. Although he is very suspicious\nof the notion of final causality (teleology) in general, he thinks it\nis quite appropriate for intelligent, voluntary agents such as human\nbeings. Thus the frequent charge that Ockham severs ethics from\nmetaphysics by denying teleology seems\n wrong.[51]\n Nevertheless, while Ockham grants that human beings have a natural\norientation, a tendency toward their own ultimate good, he does not\nthink this restricts their choices. \nFor Ockham, as for Aristotle and Aquinas, I can choose the means to\nachieve my ultimate good. But in addition, for Ockham unlike Aristotle\nand Aquinas, I can choose whether to will that ultimate good.\nThe natural orientation and tendency toward that good is built in; I\ncannot do anything about that. But I can choose whether or\nnot to to act to achieve that good. I might choose, for\nexample, to do nothing at all, and I might choose this knowing full\nwell what I am doing. But more: I can choose to act knowingly directly\nagainst my ultimate good, to thwart\n it.[52]\n I can choose evil as evil. \nFor Ockham, this is required if I am going to be morally responsible\nfor my actions. If I could not help but will to act to achieve my\nultimate good, then it would not be morally praiseworthy of me to do\nso; moral “sins of omission” would be impossible (although\nof course I could be mistaken in the means I adopt). By the same\ntoken, moral “sins of commission” would be impossible if I\ncould not knowingly act against my ultimate good. But for\nOckham these conclusions are not just required by theory; they are\nconfirmed by experience. \nThe divine command themes so prominent in Ockham’s ethics are\nmuch more muted in his political theory, which on the contrary tends\nto be far more “natural” and\n “secular.”[53]\n As sketched\n above,\n Ockham’s political writings began at Avignon with a discussion\nof the issue of poverty. But later on the issues were generalized to\ninclude church/state relations more broadly. He was one of the first\nmedieval authors to advocate a form of church/state separation, and\nwas important for the early development of the notion of property\nrights. \nThe Franciscan Order at this time was divided into two parties, which\ncame to be known as the “Conventuals” and the\n“Spirituals” (or “zealots”). The Spirituals,\namong whom were Ockham, Michael of Cesena, and the other exiles who\njoined them in fleeing Avignon, tried to preserve the original ideal\nof austere poverty practiced and advocated by St. Francis himself (c.\n1181–1226). The Conventuals, on the other hand, while\nrecognizing this ideal, were prepared to compromise in order to\naccommodate the practical needs of a large, organized religious order;\nthey were by far the majority of the order. The issue between the two\nparties was never one of doctrine; neither side accused the other of\nheresy. Rather, the question was one of how to shape and run the\norder—in particular, whether the Franciscans should (or even\ncould) renounce all property rights. \nThe ideal of poverty had been (and still is) a common one in religious\ncommunities. Typically, the idea is that the individual member of the\norder owns no property at all. If a member buys a car, for instance,\nit is not strictly his car, even though he may have exclusive use of\nit, and it was not bought with his money; he doesn’t have any\nmoney of his own. Rather it belongs to the order. \nThe original Franciscan ideal went further. Not only did the\nindividual friar have no property of his own, neither did the\norder. The Franciscans, therefore, were really supposed to be\n“mendicants,” to live by begging. Anything donated to the\norder, such as a house or a piece of land, strictly speaking remained\nthe property of the original owner (who merely granted the\nuse of it to the Franciscans). (Or, if that would not\nwork—as, for example, in the case of a bequest in a will, after\nthe original owner had died—the ownership would go to the\nPapacy.) \nBoth the Spirituals and the Conventuals thought this ideal of\nuncompromising poverty was exhibited by the life of Jesus and the\nApostles, who—they said—had given up all property, both\nindividually and collectively. St. Francis regarded this as\nthe clear implication of several Scriptural passages: e.g., Matt.\n6:24–34, 8:20, 19:21. In short, the Apostolic (and Franciscan)\nideal was, “Live without a safety net.” \nOf course, if everyone lived according to this ideal, so that no one\nowned any property either individually or collectively, then there\nwould be no property at all. The Franciscan ideal, then, shared by\nConventuals and Spirituals alike, entailed the total abolition of all\nproperty rights. \nNot everyone shared this view. Outside the Franciscan order, most\ntheoreticians agreed that Jesus and the Apostles lived without\nindividual property, but thought they did share property collectively.\nNevertheless, Pope Nicholas III, in 1279, had officially approved the\nFranciscan view, not just as a view about how to organize the\nFranciscan order, but about the interpretation of the Scriptural\npassages concerning Jesus and the Apostles. His approval did not mean\nhe was endorsing the Franciscan reading as the correct interpretation\nof Scripture, but only that it was a permissible one, that there was\nnothing doctrinally suspect about\n it.[54] \nNevertheless, this interpretation was a clear reproach to the Papacy,\nwhich at Avignon was wallowing in wealth to a degree it had never seen\nbefore. The clear implication of the Franciscan view, therefore, was\nthat the Avignon Popes were conspicuously not living their\nlives as an “imitation of Christ.” Whether for this reason\nor another, the Avignon Pope John XXII decided to reopen discussion of\nthe question of Apostolic poverty and to come to some resolution of\nthe matter. But, as Mollat [1963] puts it (perhaps not without some\ntaking of\n sides):[55] \nIt was this act that provoked John XXII to issue his first\ncontribution to the dispute, his bull Ad conditorem in 1322.\nThere he put the whole matter in a legal framework. \nAccording to Roman law, as formulated in the Code of Justinian,\n“ownership” and “legitimate use” cannot be\npermanently separated. For example, it is one thing for me to own a\nbook but to let you use it for a while. Ownership in that case means\nthat I can recall the book, and even if I do not do so, you should\nreturn it to me when you are done with it. But it is quite another\nmatter for me to own the book but to grant you permanent use\nof it, to agree not to recall it as long as you want to keep it, and\nto agree that you have no obligation to give it back ever.\nJohn XXII points out that, from the point of view of Roman law, the\nlatter case makes no sense. There is no practical difference in that\ncase between your having the use of the book and your owning it; for\nall intents and purposes, it is yours. \nNotice the criticism here. It is a legal argument against the claim\nthat the Papacy as an institution can own something and yet the\nFranciscans as an order, collectively, have a permanent right to use\nit. The complaint is not against the notion that an\nindividual friar might have a right to use something until he dies, at\nwhich time use reverts to the order (or as the Franciscans would have\nit, to the Papacy). This would still allow some distinction between\nownership and mere use. Rather the complaint is against the notion\nthat the order would not own anything outright, but would nevertheless\nhave permanent use of it that goes beyond the life or death of any\nindividual friar, so that the ownership somehow remained permanently\nwith the Papacy, even though the Pope could not reclaim it, use it, or\ndo anything at all with it. John XXII argues that this simply\nabolishes the distinction between use and ownership. \nSpecial problems arise if the property involved is such that the use\nof it involves consuming it—e.g., food. In that case, it appears\nthat there is no real difference between ownership and even temporary\nuse. For things like food, using them amounts for practical purposes\nto owning them; they cannot be recalled after they are used. In short,\nfor John XXII, it follows that it is impossible fully to live the life\nof absolute poverty, even for the individual person (much less for a\npermanent institution like the Franciscan order). The institution of\nproperty, and property “rights,” therefore began in the\nGarden of Eden, the first time Adam or Eve ate something. These\nproperty rights are not “natural” rights; on the contrary,\nthey are established by a kind of positive law by God, who gave\neverything in the Garden to Adam and Eve. \nOckham disagreed. For him, there was no “property” in the\nGarden of Eden. Instead, Adam and Eve there had a natural right to use\nanything at hand. This natural right did not amount to a\nproperty right, however, since it could not have been used as\nthe basis of any kind of legal claim. Both John XXII and Ockham seem\nto agree in requiring that “property” (ownership) be a\nmatter of positive law, not simply of natural law. But John says there\nwas such property in the Garden of Eden, whereas Ockham claims there\nwas not; there was only a natural right, so that Adam and\nEve’s use of the goods there was legitimate. For Ockham,\n“property” first emerged only after the Fall when, by a\nkind of divine permission, people began to set up special positive\nlegal arrangements assigning the legal right to use certain things to\ncertain people (the owners), to the exclusion of anyone else’s\nhaving a legal right to them. The owners can then give\npermission to others to use what the owners own, but that permission\ndoes not amount to giving them a legal right they could appeal to in a\ncourt of law; it can be revoked at any time. For Ockham, this is the\nway the Franciscans operate. Their benefactors and donors do not give\nthem any legal rights to use the things donated to them—i.e., no\nright they could appeal to in a court of law. Rather the donation\namounts only to a kind of permission that restores the original\nnatural (not legal) right of use in the Garden of\n Eden.[56]","contact.mail":"panaccio.claude@uqam.ca","contact.domain":"uqam.ca"}]
