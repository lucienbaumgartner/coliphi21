Hall","author1.info":"http://melindahall.net","entry":"disability-critical","body.text":"\n\n\nCritical disability theory refers to a diverse, interdisciplinary set\nof theoretical approaches. The task of critical disability theory is\nto analyze disability as a cultural, historical, relative, social, and\npolitical phenomenon. Some call this work “critical disability\nstudies” or CDS (e.g., Meekosha & Shuttleworth 2009; Vehmas\n& Watson 2014). The use of “critical disability\ntheory” here intends to capture a broader swath of approaches,\nincluding those originating in the field of philosophy. Critical\ndisability theory is a methodology, not a “subject-oriented area\nof study” (Schalk 2017). As a methodology, the theory \n\n\n\n\ninvolves scrutinizing not bodily or mental impairments but the social\nnorms that define particular attributes as impairments, as well as the\nsocial conditions that concentrate stigmatized attributes in\nparticular populations. (2017) \n\n\n\nCritical disability theorists direct their work toward activism,\nhowever, and do not intend insights to remain within academic\nconfines. For example, Julie Avril Minich argues that critical\ndisability theory involves the \n\n\n\n\nscrutiny of normative ideologies [that] should occur not for its own\nsake but with the goal of producing knowledge in support of justice\nfor people with stigmatized bodies and minds. (2017) \n\n\n\nFor this reason, thinkers should “recommit” to\n“social justice work”, including working in solidarity for\nthe purposes of liberation with people “devalued” or\n“pathologized” but perhaps not labeled or self-identified\nas disabled (2017). Others have argued that activism such as material\npractices related to access are a central part of critical disability\nscholarship, “whether in the classroom, at conferences, in web\nspace, or in our writing” (Hamraie 2016).\n\n\nIn this way, critical disability theory is an emancipatory and\ndeveloping discourse (Goodley, Liddiard, & Runswick Cole 2018:\n206; Meekosha & Shuttleworth 2009: 48). Thinkers use the method to\nboth describe the socio-political constructions of disability and\ntrack the impacts of these constructions on oppressed persons,\nincluding but not limited to those to whom the concept\n“disability” attaches. Critical disability theory, then,\nnecessarily refers to lived experiences and attempts to transform the\ncircumstances under which oppressed subjects live through critical,\nintersectional analysis. Complicating this expansive approach,\naccountability to disabled persons is paramount to this work (Minich\n2016). But, some call for accountability and simultaneously argue that\ncritical disability theory should resist distinctions between disabled\nand non-disabled subjects. Nirmala Erevelles, for example, does not\nseek to claim “everyone is disabled” but prefers\nhistorically-embedded materialist accounts of disability at\nintersections among multiple categories of analysis, including\n“race, class, gender, nation, and sexual identity” (2014,\ncf. Erevelles & Kafer 2010: 219). Similarly, Alison Kafer refuses\na “fixed definition” of disability. She favors leaving\nopen the boundaries of the concept of disability and, therefore, does\nnot settle who counts as disabled. She uses Joan W. Scott’s\nnotion of “collective affinity” to describe disability as\na wide net, inhering in no particular persons, but rather describing\ndisability as a complex set of features, attributed to individuals,\nthat pathologize and oppress (2013: 11). At root, as Dianne Pothier\nand Richard Devlin argue, critical disability theory will claim that\n\n\n\n\n\ndisability is not fundamentally a question of medicine or health, nor\nis it just an issue of sensitivity and compassion; rather, it is a\nquestion of politics and power(lessness), power over, and power to.\n(2006: 2, as quoted in Gillies 2014 and Sleeter 2010)\n\n\n\nWhile it is clear, then, that critical disability theory attends to\ndevalued persons, controversy over who the subject of critical\ndisability theory is lies at the heart of the approach. This\ncontroversy strongly signals the import of critical disability\nmethodology for theoretical work more generally. Critical disability\ntheory deals seriously with the heritage and construction of\ndisability identity, but that identity is in flux and related to the\nvery nature of human embodiment. Disability is unique as an\n“identity category” because “anyone can enter [it]\nat any time, and we will all join it if we live long enough”\n(Garland-Thomson 2002: 20). Indeed, the concern for vulnerability in\nthe approach extends to non-human animals, as some critical disability\ntheorists engage critical animal studies (Taylor 2017). This makes\ncritical disability theory, insofar as it reveals crucial aspects of\nembodiment, an essential ingredient of any political and social\nanalysis.\n\n\nYet some theorists prefer to engage questions of power directly,\nrather than vulnerable embodiment. Some theorists argue that\ndisability, and its\n“precursors”—impairments—are precisely the\nproducts of power relations (Tremain 2017: 86). For others, disability\nrefers to a body’s incongruence within “space and in the\nmilieu of expectations” (Garland-Thomson 2002: 20). While power\nand incongruence have material effects, including disabling effects on\nembodiment, these critical disability theorists will describe\ndisability in immediate reference to power, including its exclusions\nand hierarchies in discourses and institutions. This, however, again\npoints to the importance of critical disability theory. Attention\nto—for example—abnormality, hierarchies of capability, and\nother exclusionary constructions related to disability simultaneously\ndeepen and are deepened by analysis of racism and sexism. If\ndisability is a direct expression of power, as these theorists argue,\nthen power and its effect on human life cannot be understood without\ntreating disability politically and socially.\n\n\nAlliances among critical discourses, including queer theory and\nfeminist theory, are essential to the task of critical disability\ntheory, as no one theory or discipline alone can nor should attempt to\nhandle the complexity and scope of the phenomena of disability\n(Sleeter 2010). Broad coalitional possibilities are available to\ndisability theorists, although these possibilities traditionally go\nunrealized or remain nascent. These include “academic and\npolitical connections” with other identity-based areas of study,\nincluding “race/ethnic” and “sexuality/queer”\nstudies (Schalk 2013; cf. Goodley, Liddiard, & Cole 2018: 206).\nFor Sami Schalk, critical disability theory must take up these\npotential coalitions wherever possible to further its goals. These\ngoals, as already implied, are both political and conceptual. In an\nexample of coalitional analysis, Erevelles describes her work this\nway: \n\n\n\n\nI have argued that the ideology of disability has been used to justify\nthe racial and gendered division of labor based on heteronormative\nnotions of the family and, in doing so, organizes class relations in a\ncapitalist society. (Erevelles & Kafer 2010: 206) \n\n\n\nCritical analysis of the phenomena of heterosexism, sexism, and\nracism, therefore, must make reference to the insights of disability\ntheory in order to achieve their goals. As this entry will\ndemonstrate, critical disability theory and its nuanced approach to\nvulnerability and power is a key ingredient of critical theory more\ngenerally.\n\n\nThis entry intends to describe the contours of critical disability\ntheory, including historical antecedents and key debates. It examines\nkey approaches in critical disability theory and what these approaches\noffer for the study of disability. It also considers what critical\ndisability theory offers to the analysis of other socio-political\nphenomena and philosophical problems. Further, this entry describes\nhow critical disability theorists leverage normativity and politics.\nThis entry takes into account the considerable overlap between\ncritical disability theory and feminist theory, both within and\noutside the traditional confines of the field of philosophy. It does\nnot, however, explicitly explore feminist approaches to disability\n(e.g., K. Hall 2011; Kittay & Feder 2002; Mackenzie, Rogers, &\nDodds 2014; and Wendell 1996; see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on disability).\n Additionally, although critical disability theory engages legal\nissues, work using this approach done in the field of law is not\nexplored here (e.g., Basas 2008, 2013a, 2013b; Belt 2015, 2017; Brown\n2014; and Nelson 2016; see the entry\n disability and justice).\n This entry, however, does cover Continental philosophical approaches\nto questions of disability, as these intimately intertwine with and\nprovide examples of critical disability theory. One final note:\nterminology varies significantly in literature on disability, and so\nthis entry uses the language of the thinkers whose work it\ndescribes. This method generates inconsistencies within the entry\nitself, but any resulting tensions are more fruitful than imposing an\narbitrary set of terms that thinkers themselves would not\nrecognize.\n\n\nThis entry has five primary sections. First, by way of background, the\nentry articulates and explores critical disability theory’s\norigin in and continued resonance with critical theory. Then, it\nintroduces tensions within disability studies, including the use of\nthe new language of “critical disability theory” to mark\noff critical approaches against traditional “disability\nstudies”. Second, the entry considers key interdisciplinary\napproaches in critical disability theory, including crip theory, work\nat the intersections of disability and race, including dis/ability\ncritical race theory, indigenous approaches, and postcolonial\napproaches. Third, the entry covers philosophical approaches employing\nContinental philosophy, with special attention paid to the influence\nof Foucault. In the fourth section, the entry discusses political\nengagement, including challenges posed to psychology in the critical\ndisability theory milieu and activism around critical disability\ntheory. Finally, the entry offers concluding thoughts regarding the\nfuture of critical disability theory.\n\nThis section explores two crucial elements of the setting of critical\ndisability theory: its heritage in critical theory and its tensions\nand overlap with more traditional disability studies. \nCritical disability theory is able to challenge traditional disability\nstudies and engage in transformative, intersectional, and coalitional\ncritical work (Ellis et al. 2018). This is thanks in part to its\nheritage in the critical theory of the Frankfurt School and especially\nthe influence of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer (Burghardt 2011: 3:\nMeekosha & Shuttleworth 2009: 51–52). Broadly understood,\ncritical theory identifies, describes, and analyzes the subsumed or\nhidden origins of social and political culture, discourses, and\ninstitutions. In these ways, critical theory also exposes the\ncontingency of ideas or circumstances often presumed natural or\nunchangeable. Diverse critical theories unite in the sense that they\ntarget ideology, distrust appearances, and often point out false\nconsciousness. Critical disability theory thus allies itself with\nContinental philosophical methods, including phenomenology, Freudian\npsychoanalysis, and neo-Marxist approaches (Kearney & Rainwater\n1996: 195). Continental philosophy involves a widespread rejection of\nmeaning narrowly rooted in science, and it responds to the crisis of\nthe collapse of meaning and temptation to nihilism in modernity\ngenerally (Kearney 1986: 2). Under this umbrella, critical theory\nfinds that meaning has social origins, often from “historical\nstrategies of domination and liberation”; therefore, critical\ntheory is interested in “the social relation of the human\nsubject to the historical conditions of production or\nalienation” (Kearney 1986: 2; see the entry on\n critical theory). \nCritical disability theory is committed to praxis and inquiry that\ninvolve “in-depth analysis of the structural and as-yet\nincompletely understood psychic underpinnings of oppression”\n(Burghardt 2011: 13). In this way, the critical theory of the\nFrankfurt School is a necessary ingredient to its work. Madeline\nBurghardt writes,  \nCritical theory challenges cultural discursive institutions which\nundergird viable practices of exclusion and misrepresentation, and\nthus offers a map toward greater understanding and informed challenge.\nAt its core, critical theory insists that we remain attentive to\n“the human bottom of non-human things” (Horkheimer 1972:\nxiii), suggesting an ongoing commitment to the lives implicated in\ncultural and political practices. (2011: 13) \nFor Helen Meekosha and Russell Shuttleworth, critical disability\ntheory necessarily includes four primary principles, as follows (2009:\n52). First, “critical social theory is irreducible to\nfacts”, meaning that the methods of such a theory outstrip\nquantitative analysis and reject reduction to the quantitative;\nfurther, such theory rejects “atheoretical, context-free\nscience”, claiming that such science is an inappropriate way to\naccess phenomena under analysis (2009: 52; see also Samuels 2014).\nSecond, “critical social theory links theory with praxis in the\nstruggle for an autonomous and participatory society” (2009:\n52). This praxis involves viewing autonomy as “emancipation from\nhegemonic and hierarchical ideologies” rather than reducing\nautonomy to independence, as was common in disability theorizing in\nthe 1970s–1990s (2009: 52–53). Third, “critical\nsocial theory is self-aware of its historicity”, meaning that it\nsees its own work as embedded within a time and place, reflexively\ntargeting itself with the historical analysis it applies to social\nstructures and institutions (2009: 53–54). Fourth,\n“critical social theory engages in dialogue among\ncultures”; on this point, Meekosha and Shuttleworth “call\nfor an explicit dialogue with human rights and emancipatory thinking\nfrom the diversity of cultures” and hope to avoid\n“projecting an international ideal” from Western to\nnon-Western cultures (2009: 54). \nThe framing of critical disability theory within critical theory\npartially sets its agenda and opens out to fresh methodologies. For\nexample, critical theory acts as a hinge between critical disability\ntheory and feminist theory and can drive an integrated\nfeminist-disability analysis (Garland-Thomson 2002). Rosemarie\nGarland-Thomson’s feminist-disability analysis engages\n“several fundamental premises of critical theory”,\nincluding these: representation structures reality; the margins define\nthe center; gender and disability are ways of signifying relationships\nof power; human identity is multiple and unstable; and all analysis\nand evaluation has political implications (2002: 6). Along these\nlines, Garland-Thomson writes,  \nDisability—like gender—is a concept that pervades all\naspects of culture: its structuring institutions, social identities,\ncultural practices, political positions, historical communities, and\nthe shared human experience of embodiment. (2002: 4)  \nIn this way, disability and ability are fundamentally\n“produced” rather than discovered; this production occurs\nthrough a “disability/ability system”. Disability\ntheorists can employ this system as a category of analysis to help\n“denaturalize” disability (2002: 6). Similarly, Sami\nSchalk argues,  \nby designating (dis)ability as a system of social norms which\ncategorizes, ranks, and values bodyminds and disability as a\nhistorically and culturally variable category within this larger\nsystem, critical disability studies can better engage in conversations\nabout the ways both ability and disability operate. (2017) \nThe benefits of critical disability theory, however, do not merely\naccrue to the study of disability. Critical disability theory offers\ncrucial resources to other analyses, including but not limited to\nthose conducted in feminist philosophy and philosophy more generally.\nFeminist theory needs disability analysis in order to achieve its own\ngoals, and, again, it is best to unite the two through common critical\ntheory strategies (Garland-Thomson 2002: 2–3). For\nGarland-Thomson, without disability analysis, feminism cannot\ncritically tackle problems like infanticide, selective abortion,\neugenic programs, coercive rehabilitation, genocide, and normalizing\nsurgical procedures, among other phenomena (2002: 9). Meanwhile,\nShelley Tremain demonstrates that feminist philosophy’s\nconceptual work on “essentialism and constructivism, identity,\nrace, sexuality, agency, experience, and oppression” is\nfurthered through the development of a feminist philosophy of\ndisability, as disability analysis aids in debates over these terms\n(2015: 8). \nFurther, critical disability theory contributes to philosophy in a\nbroad range of ways. Critical disability theory challenges the\nmarginalization of the study of disability and its ghettoization\nwithin bioethics (and its circumscription, thereby, to the medical\nmodel) (Tremain 2017). As Tremain argues, disability matters to core\ndebates in philosophy. Specifically, philosophy of disability, as one\nform critical disability theory can take, contributes to central\nphilosophical puzzles, including debates over relativism, materialism,\nrealism, and determinism (2015). \nCritical disability theory is significantly aimed toward exposing and\nanalyzing ableism. Ableism is, minimally, discrimination on the basis\nof ability, perceived or actual (Campbell 2009: 5). Ableism as a\nprejudicial attitude prefers and prioritizes the features of the empty\nsubject Garland-Thomson refers to as the “normate” while\nsystematically excluding the abnormal or non-normative embodied minds\n(1996: 9). But, critical disability thinking situates it maximally as\na set of primary social and political structures that marginalize,\norganize and rank subjects and objects, shapes discourse, and\nundergirds institutions. Ableism is  \na network of beliefs, processes and practices that produces a\nparticular kind of self and body (the corporeal standard) that is\nprojected as the perfect, species-typical and therefore essential and\nfully human. Disability then is cast as a diminished state of being\nhuman. (Campbell 2001: 44)  \nAbleism systematically interacts with other power structures that\nstigmatize to produce race, gender, sex, and disability. Ableism\nshapes our world and produces disability;  \nregimes of ableism have produced a depth of disability negation that\nreaches into the caverns of collective subjectivity to the extent that\nthe notion of disability as inherently negative is seen as a\n‘naturalized’ reaction to an aberration. (Campbell 2009:\n166)  \nSome refer to this social and political structure as disablism or use\nthe terms interchangeably (Campbell 2009: 5 and Goodley 2014). \nAbleism and resistance to ableism is central to the tradition of\ncritical disability theory (Campbell 2008b). To conceive of its\nimportance, consider the parallel to racism: racism and anti-racist\nwork is a necessary and indisputable part of the tradition of critical\nrace theory, regardless of how racism is understood and framed. But,\nit would be wrong to consider ableism as an additive to sexism and\nracism. Instead, theorizing ableism is part of a “critique of\nthe dominant order, the other, or alterity” (Goodley 2009).\nTheorizing ableism is urgent (Wolbring 2008). \nA core conception of ableism at work in everyday life is behind most,\nif not all, work in critical disability theory. Landmark texts in\ncritical disability theory treating ableism directly include Fiona\nKumari Campbell’s work, which brings together politics, law, and\nculture to mark out and establish an expansive reading of ableism and\ndescribe its “production, operation, and maintenance”\n(2009: 4). Ableism erases disability, as “ableistnormativity\nresults in compulsive passing, wherein there is a failure to ask about\ndifference, to imagine human be-ingness differently” (2009: 4).\nCampbell theorizes the false consciousness of internalized ableism\n(2008a). Jennifer Scuro analyzes ableism and brings its impacts to the\nfore to rethink neoliberalism and link the two together (2017). \nTheorists have recently used ableism to interrogate what disability\nis, including cognitive disability (Carlson 2001), how ableism works\ntogether with and produces race (Campbell 2008a), the ableism of the concept of\nresilience (Hutcheon & Wolbring 2013), questions of epistemic\nresponsibility (Reynolds 2016a), sexuality (Baril & Trevenen\n2014), and a critical theory of harm (Reynolds 2016b). Meanwhile an\nableist lens has been brought to the discipline and practice of\nacademia (Dolmage 2017; Wolbring 2012). \nThe denaturalization of disability is a key task of critical\ndisability theory, in line with its critical heritage (e.g., Tremain\n2017: 33 and 86). This work includes challenging the distinction\nbetween impairment and disability, common in more traditional\ndisability studies, which sets aside impairment as natural and\ndisability as socially constructed (Meekosha & Shuttleworth 2009,\n50; Tremain 2017: 93, 115). Indeed, Tremain argues that impairment\nitself is socially constructed (2001). Denaturalizing disability and\nimpairment are part of the analysis, politicization, and\nintersectional understanding of disability sought by critical\ndisability theorists. \nNirmala Erevelles sounds a word of warning with regard to alliances\nacross critical theories, citing Sharon Snyder and David\nMitchell’s concept of narrative prosthesis, whereby fiction\nwriters use disability to further plot. She worries that  \nsomething similar happens in critical theory—where, for example,\nDeaf/disability studies likens disability experiences to that of race,\nwhile race theorists describe their own oppression as disability. In\neach case, rather than interrogate the relationship, each group\nborrows the other’s oppressive associations in an attempt to\nexplain its own oppression. (Erevelles and Kafer 2010: 217)  \nAnalysis in critical disability studies hopes to move beyond the\nborrowing of oppressive associations to describe the intimate\nrelationships among systems of oppression. \nCritical disability theory challenges the normative assumptions,\nfocus, and direction of more traditional disability studies. This more\ntraditional disability studies is an interdisciplinary field with\norigins in the promotion of the social model of disability (Mollow\n2017: 340; see the entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience).\n Disability studies largely focuses on achieving political inclusion\nfor disabled people. To that end, work done under the auspices of\ndisability studies often uses the language of civil rights, minority\npolitics, and liberal justice frameworks. Simi Linton describes\ndisability studies as both a pedagogical effort—a\n“remedial endeavor, redressing the sins of omission and\ncommission in the canon”—and as a necessarily political\neffort focused on the “epistemology of inclusion and\nintegration” (1998: 525–526). Linton cautions that there\nis a tendency within some academic fields, notably those in the health\nprofessions, to refer to themselves as “disability\nstudies” by virtue of taking disabled people as objects of study\n(1998: 526). Yet, this is inaccurate, as disability studies takes the\nopposite approach, seeking leadership by disabled people and\ninvestigation into social circumstances. Along similar lines, it is\nimportant to notice that the language of disability studies has been\ncoopted, for example, by “rehabilitation and special education\ndepartments” that remain tied to the medical model and are not\n“rewriting the script” when it comes to disability\n(Meekosha & Shuttleworth 2009: 49). Disability studies, working in\ntandem with the disability rights movement, shifts the focus from the\nmedical model and correlational intervention on disabled people to\nincrease “fit” in society to the “rigidity,\nfaultiness, deficits, and pathological structures” in society\nitself (Linton 2005: 518). For example, Linton writes,  \nDisability studies’ project is to weave disabled people back\ninto the fabric of society…as full citizens whose rights and\nprivileges are intact, whose history and contributions are recorded,\nand whose often distorted representations in art, literature, film,\ntheater, and other forms of artistic expression are fully analyzed.\n(ibid.) \nAs aforementioned, traditional disability studies relies on the social\nmodel. The social model explicitly draws from critical theory, which\nmakes it “paradoxical” that critical disability theory\nuses the same tradition to critique traditional disability studies\n(Meekosha & Shuttleworth 2009: 50). Yet, for Meekosha and\nShuttleworth, the turn to the language of critical disability theory\nand away from the language of disability studies  \nsignifies an implicit understanding that the terms of engagement in\ndisability studies have changed; that the struggle for social justice\nand diversity continues but on another plane of development—one\nthat is not simply social, economic and political, but also\npsychological, cultural, discursive and carnal. (ibid.) \nCritical disability theory thus responds to the traditional disability\nstudies project by pointing to its limits, including exclusions and\nframing. Concerns and objects of critique include disability\nstudies’ largely liberal approach (Sleeter 2010), narrow\nconsideration of physical disability, focus on the global North\n(Meekosha & Shuttleworth 2009: 49) and independent living (2009:\n52–53 and Kelly 2010), downplay of pain and suffering (Mollow\n2017: 350), and ties to or investment in class elitism (Erevelles\n& Kafer 2010: 208), neoliberalism (Sleeter 2010), masculinism\n(Kelly 2010), materialism (Vehmas & Watson 2014), somatophobia\n(Goodley, Liddiard, & Runswick Cole 2018: 201 and Snyder &\nMitchell 2001), and white supremacy (Bell 2006; Erevelles & Kafer\n2010: 208; and Moore, Lewis, & Brown 2018 – see Other\nInternet Resources). \nFurther, critical disability theory demonstrates the ways exclusions\nin traditional disability studies come about. Some differences, such\nas “radical linguistic difference”, including that\nintroduced by Deaf Studies, and “cognitive disabilities and\nrelated communicative differences” are regularly excluded from\ndisability studies (Erevelles & Kafer 2010: 212–213). One\nway these exclusions occur is through investment in the figure of the\npublic disability studies scholar and activist, who attempts to\n“demonstrate a powerful, resistant, and rational voice in the\npublic arena”; Nirmala Erevelles argues, “more often than\nnot, that voice embodies the normative modes of communication and\nrationality” (2010: 213). Erevelles calls critical theoretical\nand political coalitions with those with cognitive difference and\nmental illness “dangerous alliances”, given the importance\ndisability studies has placed on embodying and using that voice (2010:\n214). She advocates for brokering these alliances and defusing the\ndominant voice of disability studies. On a different note, Erevelles\nsees radical potential in Deaf Studies, but recommends it remain its\nown field to maintain positive tension with other areas of disability\nstudies (2010: 210–212). Critique in these areas, and others,\nhas led to the growth of critical disability theory and set its\nagenda. \nCriticisms along these lines is well-received by some theorists. For\nexample, Ann Fox frames such criticism as a reminder that the\ntraditional disability studies must strive to be\n“critical”; she specifically notes the problems of  \n[disability studies’] erasure of bodies of color, reinforcing\nhierarchies, policing points of view, and moments of careerism over\ncoalition. (2017) \nOthers, meanwhile, argue that criticisms are unfair and stem from a\nmisguided approach. For example, Simo Vehmas and Nick Watson defend\ndisability studies against some key challenges made by “critical\ndisability studies”, including a rejection of disability\nstudies’ materialism (in this case, the authors mean classical\nMarxist theory; Vehmas & Watson 2014). Referring to critical\ndisability theorists as “post-structural anti-dualists”,\nVehmas and Watson reject their approach as lacking the foundation to\ndo normative, and therefore necessary political, work (2014:\n638–639). They write, “[Critical Disability Studies] does\nnot examine how things ought to be for disabled people in terms of\nright and wrong, good and bad” (2014: 638). Yet, critical\ndisability theorists consistently conceive of themselves as doing\nnormative and political work. For example, Margrit Shildrick responds\nto the critique that her feminist postmodernism is non-normative. She\nwrites,  \nthe very absence of laws, absolutes, and guiding rules and principles\nnecessitates a high degree of personal responsibility in the face of\nthe demand for response,  \nwhich issues in a “profound engagement with the issues at\nhand” (2008: 33; see also Shildrick 2012). \nAs aforementioned, some critical disability theorists worry that pain\nis not taken seriously enough in traditional disability studies\n(Mollow 2017, 350). Yet, those working to transform traditional\ndisability studies have not settled the role of pain in critical work\non disability. Indeed, the question of pain behaves as metonymy for\nthe role of embodiment in disability more generally (Tremain 2017:\n114). Some have argued that, as the lasting impacts of the social\nmodel of disability drives theorists away from embodiment and toward\npolitical and social descriptions of disability, the body has been\nlost. Feminist thinkers of disability like Jenny Morris want to\nmaintain a narrative of disability by which they can achieve\nrecognition of the obstacles that bodies can present. According to\ndisability theorists Tom Shakespeare and Mark Erickson, these\nthinkers:  \ndo not deny that society causes many problems, [but] they also feel\nthat their bodies may cause difficulties, and they want any theory of\ndisability to take account of the physical dimension to their lives.\nThey suggest that in developing a social and structural analysis the\ndisability movement has omitted a key facet of their experience.\n(2001: 195)  \nIndeed, Susan Wendell argues that the desire to relegate pain, and the\npossibility of pain, to an “other” while fantasizing about\na “normal” body importantly undergirds ableist exclusions\nand the refusal of disabled people. For her, attending to pain must\nplay a role in becoming reconciled to one’s body (1996: 179).\nSo, to disregard pain and its role in disability would be to\nmisunderstand hierarchies of normality. Shelley Tremain, however,\nmaintains a tight focus on the social and political, arguing that\n“pain and the experience of it are historically and culturally\nrelative and interpreted” (Tremain 2017: 116). Whether or not\npain is denied, and how pain is seen to play a role in disability, has\nbecome a flashpoint in critical disability theory. \nThese tensions, and more, have arisen in the literature. Even as\nseismic transformation occurs, it is not clear whether critical\ndisability theory is a new movement or the continued development of\nmore traditional disability studies. Language use varies among\ntheorists as well as among intersectional, politically engaged work on\ndisability that emerges in multiple scholarly circles. Along these\nlines, Meekosha and Shuttleworth wonder if critical disability theory\n“constitutes a radical paradigm shift or simply signifies a\nmaturing of [disability studies]” (2009: 48). This entry will\nnot attempt to settle this matter, as it is not settled; rather, it\nwill cover those signature methods and topics that theorists largely\nagree count as developing work in critical disability theory. \nThis section explores interdisciplinary approaches to critical\ndisability theory, along with the areas where there are overlaps and\ntensions. It describes the intersection of critical disability theory\nwith queer theory and critical race studies, as well as encounters\nwith indigenous thought. Crip theory, dis/ability critical race\nstudies and black disability studies, and indigenous theory and\npostcolonial theory, are all discussed. This section aims to be highly\ninclusive yet is at the same time limited by the fact that this\nliterature is developing. \nQueer theory and critical disability theory productively collude under\nthe umbrella of “crip theory”, pushing understanding\nforward in both arenas and along new lines (McRuer 2003, 2004, and\n2006a; Mollow 2017; Schalk 2013). Queer theory and disability theory\nhave shared interests, including challenging medicalization, and some\nargue that the AIDS crisis catalyzed the connection between the two\n(e.g., Mollow 2017, 342). Further, crip theory derives from disability\nstudies but uses queer theory to develop new analyses (Schalk 2013).\nConsider, for example, questions of passing and coming out, fruitfully\nanalyzed at the nexus of queer theory and disability theory (see\nGarland Thomson 2002: 21). Crip theorist Robert McRuer argues that\ncrip theory  \nshould be understood as having a similar contestatory relationship to\ndisability studies and identity that queer theory has to LGBT studies\nand identity. (2006b: 35)  \nExpanding on this, Alison Kafer describes McRuer’s work (e.g.,\n2006b) as placing “crip theory in a contestatory relationship to\nliberal notions of acceptance, tolerance, and assimilation”\n(2009: 292). For example, McRuer “builds on queer critiques of\nneoliberalism”, by adding, for instance, to existing queer\nanalyses of the World Bank as a site of heteronormativity by\ndescribing its ableism or “antidisability” logic (Kafer\n2009: 291). Crip theorists insist on the idea that full analysis of\nthis and other sites of interest require both “queer\nand disability theory” (ibid., cf. McRuer\n2003, 2005, 2006a). These sites include the cultural imperatives of\nheterosexuality and able-bodiedness, which are significantly tied\ntogether (Kafer 2003). \nWith this in mind, the study of sexuality is one obvious site for crip\ntheory (McRuer 2011; McRuer & Mollow 2012). Literature taking a\ncrip theory approach to sexuality is varied, and much of it intersects\nwith race. Here noted are a few prominent examples. Eli Clare has\nwritten extensively, in both personal and political registers, at the\nintersection of queer experience and disability (e.g., 1999, 2001,\n2013). Ann Mollow theorizes the ambiguity of disabled sexuality in\nterms of both lack and excess, connecting her insights to\npsychoanalysis (2012). Lydia X. Z. Brown writes about relationships\nand sexuality from and for an autistic perspective (2013). Kenny\nFries, the author of several significant memoirs linking disability\nand sexuality (2003, 2007, 2017), writes about beauty and body image\n(1995 [1998]). Michael Gill, whose work focuses on sexual agency and\nintellectual disability, including sexual abuse and consent (2010,\n2015), analyzed an online reality show entitled The Specials\n(2012). The article interrogates an episode in which an encounter\namong five white intellectually disabled adults and sex workers from\nBangkok raises questions of consent and sex and gender transgression\n(ibid.). In response to the history of racism and\nableism’s explosive and continued violence in the U.S., Michelle\nJarman theorizes the “eugenic castration of cognitively disabled\nmen” in order to claim that “reading race and disability\nas interrelated, dynamic processes can inform our understanding of\nboth past and present violence” (2012: 89–90). Ellen\nSamuels theorizes the limits of the language of coming out of the\ncloset in crip terms (2003). Meanwhile, Alexandre Baril uses a crip\nframework to engage a variety of questions connected to trans identity\nand disability, including anglonormativity, cisnormativity, debility,\nand transability (2015a, 2015b, 2015c, 2016; Baril & Trevenen\n2014). \nThese questions related to sexuality do not exhaust the possibilities\nof crip theory; as McRuer’s work makes clear, crip theory\nextends to a variety of concepts using the springboard of queer and\ndisability theory. Indeed, crip theory is highly inclusive and invites\ncoalitions among pathologized persons, in the tradition of critical\ndisability theory more generally. Sami Schalk notes that  \nAlison Kafer has argued that crip theory allows for the inclusion of\n“those who lack a ‘proper’ (read: medically\nacceptable, doctor provided, and insurer-approved) diagnosis for their\nsymptoms” and “people identifying with disability and\nlacking not only a diagnosis but any ‘symptoms’ of\nimpairment”. (Kafer 2013: 12, 13, as quoted in Schalk 2017)  \nFor instance, Schalk’s productive\n“disidentification” with crip theory has led her to take\non, as a queer black non-disabled woman, the language of crip theory\nin new academic and political engagements (2013). \nFinally, and significantly, crip theory has taken up the question of\nfuturity; that is, access to the future and dreams about the future.\nThis includes the complex politics of reproduction (e.g., Jarman 2015)\nbut stands in contrast to what some describe as queer theory’s\nanti-futurity emphasis (e.g., K. Hall 2014). This thread of crip\ntheory is explicitly set up against neoliberalism and the assumption\nthat disability marks a “life not worth living” and a\n“future no one wants” (Fritsch 2016: 11, cf. Kafer 2013:\n1–3). As Kafer describes it, if disability is understood as\ntragedy, futures without disability become the only desirable futures\n(2013: 1). Yet, disability is not a fact about the body with static\nmeanings; instead, our orientation toward the future, especially\ndesires about a future without disability, have material impacts and\ncan be politically leveraged to reshape the meanings and impacts of\ndisability (M. Hall 2016). Indeed, these desires and orientations are\nfactors upon which some persons flourish and some do not. Kelly\nFritsch writes,  \nThe withering of some disabled lives and the capacitation of others\nresult from neoliberal material and discursive processes that orient\nand imagine disability as a life without a future unless capacitated\nthrough such biocapitalist practices as cures or body/mind enhancement\ntechnologies and procedures. (2016: 11–12)  \nResistance comes from insisting on a crip future and an accessible\nfuture (Kafer 2013: 153). Of the dream of disability to come, McRuer\nwrites,  \nThe disability to come…will and should always belong to the\ntime of the promise…It’s a crip promise that we will\nalways comprehend disability otherwise and that we will, collectively,\nsomehow access other worlds and futures. (2006b: 207–208, as\nquoted in Kafer 2009: 293)  \nSimilarly, Kim Q. Hall supports radical hope for just access to the\nfuture and argues that such hope has wide-ranging impacts, for not\nonly queer, crip, and feminist movements, but also mitigating climate\nchange (2014). Rayna Rapp and Faye Ginsburg, along the same lines,\nseek the collaborative creation of inhabitable worlds, focusing on the\nfuturity of disability and leveraging demographic studies to\n“make disability count” for the future rather than\n“counting disability” in the future (Ginsburg & Rapp\n2015, see also Ginsburg & Rapp 2017). \nThis focus on futurity links tightly with the tradition of critical\ntheory. For instance, Fritsch, using Theodor Adorno’s conception\nof negative dialectics, argues that disability is a central part of\nthe “sensuous critical thought” that is required for\ncritique and living otherwise (2013, cf. Adorno 1966 [1973: 11]).\nAdorno describes a world dominated by homogenizing “identity\nthinking” that “erases contradiction, antagonism, and\ndifference” and “aids and abets capitalism”. Yet,\nthe queer/disabled figure, the “transfigured crip”, is a\nmisfit that can “haunt the able-bodied world” of\ndifference-refusing identity thinking (2013). Fritsch is thus hopeful\nthat the transfigured crip can break open identity thinking. She\nwrites,  \nthe transfigured crip, through the assertion that there is always a\nremainder that exposes contradictions and haunts the limits of\nthought, will pose the greatest challenge to, and undo, both\nneoliberal capitalism and the category of disability itself. In taking\nthe differences and similarities of our sufferings seriously,\ncritically, and reflectively, we open up spaces, cracks, and\npossibilities for the difference of uncomfortable crip communities to\ncome. (ibid.) \nCritical disability theorists argue that racism and ableism operate\njointly, intensifying and borrowing from each other. These phenomena,\nalong with other forms of oppression, thus call for intersectional\nanalysis. This requires the simultaneous investigation of the\nmultiple, intersecting power relationships that affect whole persons\nthrough pathologization, stigma, and exclusion (see the entries on\n feminist perspectives on power\n and\n discrimination;\n see also Crenshaw 1991 for the origin of the term\n“intersectionality”). Intersectional analyses in critical\ndisability studies, including, for example, the work of Nirmala\nErevelles and Andrea Minear (2010) and Fiona Kumari Campbell’s\nanalysis of internalized ableism (2008a), employ and supplement the\nstrategies of critical race theory. Dis/ability Critical Race Studies\n(DisCrit) is deeply engaged in this work. DisCrit finds its primary\nlocation in the field of education but has a wide remit because\nintersections between race and disability appear at diverse sites of\nexperience and oppression.  Theorists tackle topics ranging from\npedagogy (Annamma, Boelé, Moore, & Klingner 2013) and the\nfamily (Annamma, Ferri, & Connor 2018) to mass incarceration\n(Annamma 2014a and 2014b), immigration (Annamma 2013), and school\nviolence (Watts & Erevelles 2004). They track the pipelines and\ncontinuities among governing institutions to demonstrate how these\nsites interweave to condition the educational experiences of\nracialized, disabled subjects. \nConsider the school-to-prison pipeline. Subini Annamma engages\nspatiality and geography in a DisCrit approach to the education\nexperiences of undocumented dis/abled persons, especially young girls,\nwho are caught in this pipeline (2013, 2014a, 2014b, 2017). Annamma,\nwith frequent collaborators David Connor and Beth Ferri, sets the tone\nfor the use of DisCrit in the field of education (Annamma, Connor,\n& Ferri 2013; Annamma, Ferri, & Connor 2018). Their\nwide-ranging edited volume DisCrit: Disability Studies and\nCritical Race Theory in Education presents the work of 21\nscholars on key topics and displays a variety of methodologies and\napplications (Connor, Ferri, & Annamma 2016). \nThe “foundations of DisCrit in Black and critical race feminist\nscholarship and activism”, including Anna Julia Cooper,\nKimberlé Crenshaw, Patricia Hill Collins, and a variety of\n“intellectual ancestors” such as Angela Davis, bell hooks,\nAudre Lorde, and Sojourner Truth (Annamma, Ferri, and Connor 2018:\n47). Despite the fact that disability was not significantly treated by\nthese ancestral and contemporary Black feminists, the\n“intersectional nature” of this “pioneering\nwork” has nonetheless been foundational to the development of\nDisCrit” (2018: 47–48). Taking into account foundational\nclaims in disability studies, including “privileg[ing] knowledge\nbased on lived experiences of disabled people” (2018: 49) and\ncombining this and other insights from disability studies with work in\ncritical race theory, DisCrit challenges “special\neducation” and allows theorists to better “frame and\nanalyze the lives of disabled youth of color” (2018: 49). \nAnnamma, Ferri, and Connor provide a thorough lineage of DisCrit and\nreview existing literature (2018). Out of this intensive review of\nthemes and topics, they surface seven foundational tenets of DisCrit\nand include examples in the literature of each. These tenets are as\nfollows:  \nWhile DisCrit literature is growing, with contributions from a circle\nof dedicated scholars, Annamma, Ferri, and Connor note that in their\noriginal field of special education thinkers are largely “quite\nresistant to engage in the racialized nature of education and\ndis/ability in meaningful or sustained ways” (2018: 48). The\nthree are “cautiously optimistic” that growth in DisCrit\nwill involve more “engagement across disciplines” and\n“studies that take up all seven tenets in a sustained way”\n(2018: 63). \nMeanwhile, Black disability studies has developed a distinct approach\nto pedagogy, advocating for interventions that would shift entire\neducational paradigms and refuse obfuscating, special-topic treatment\nin curricula (Dunhamn et al. 2015). Approaches to disability must\nchange to open up useful racial analysis. For instance, it is\nimpossible, Sami Schalk argues, to theorize the intersection of race\nand disability without considering both disability and\nability. For instance, she argues that disability,  \nin terms of claims of lesser intellectual abilities, was used to\njustify the enslavement of black people, while at the same time an\nunderstanding of black people’s bodies as hyper strong and\nimpervious to heat and pain also justified conditions of slave labor.\nThis racial double bind, to borrow from Marilyn Frye, positioned black\npeople as at once disabled and hyper able and yet suited for slavery\nin both cases. (2017) \nLiat Ben-Moshe, whose work on incarceration, deinstitutionalization,\nand mad studies supports a number of threads in critical disability\ntheory and significantly intersects with race, has also worked on\nissues of disability in pedagogy and education. Ben-Moshe co-edited\nBuilding Pedagogical Curb Cuts (Ben-Moshe, Cory, Feldbaum,\n& Sagendorf 2005), a text offering resources for accessibility in\nhigher education and integrating disability into curriculum. She has\nattended to the issue of using disability as metaphor in the\nclassroom, suggesting ways to incorporate a critical perspective by\nwhich educators can fruitfully teach the use of disability in\nliterature (2006). Ben-Moshe also co-edited a special issue of\nDisability Studies Quarterly on the topic of\n“Interventions in Disability Studies Pedagogy” (Volume 35,\nNo. 2). In the introduction to this issue, Ben-Moshe writes, “I\nperceive Disability Studies as missionary work and much of my pedagogy\nis the work of conversion”. In describing conversion, Ben-Moshe\nrefers to access but also “converting students to understanding\ndisability intersectionally, as an identity and a culture”\n(Ben-Moshe, Day, Ferris, & Nielsen [eds] 2015). \nGaining a fuller analytic picture at the nexus of race and disability\ncalls for attention to indigenous persons. Literature on disabled\nindigenous experiences and related concepts is growing. For example,\nHuhana Hickey theorizes from the Māori perspective on the\npolitical and social circumstances of disabled indigenous persons\n(2001). Hickey demonstrates that, in addition to the fact that\nmultiply oppressed persons have difficulty getting their needs met\nthrough non-intersectional discourse and activism, Māori with\ndisabilities face additional barriers. Specifically, they experience\ninvalidation and minimization of their disabilities within Māori\ncommunities (2008: 1). Multiple factors create this situation,\nincluding the diversity of cultures within Māori communities,\nsome of which do not have words and concepts for disability identity\n(2008: 3). Economic oppression among Māori disproportionately\naffects disabled persons, influencing political and social access.\nYet, without the language to describe these issues, their lack of\naccess is not addressed (2008: 3–4). Further, some Māori\nattribute disability to spiritual or social causes, which leads to\nexclusion (2008: 3). Significantly, Hickey also cites the\npost-colonial status of Māori communities as a factor that\nfurther complicates questions of religion and contributes to the\nexclusion of disabled Māori (2008: 4–5). Rejecting both the\nmedical and social models of disability, Hickey advocates for a\ncommunities-based model that supports access and human rights (2006).\nShe seeks disability support options for Maori in her research\n(2004). \nMeanwhile, Lavonna Lovern theorizes indigenous disability from a\nNative American perspective, considering difference and inclusion\nwithin Native American communities in North America (2008, 2017). She\nargues that theorists and activists must address differences between\nthe dominant culture and Native American cultures; otherwise a choice\nto identify as disabled may further oppress those within Native\nAmerican cultures. Addressing differences includes paying critical\nattention to the ontology and epistemology in Native American\ncommunities when theorizing about indigenous disability or working in\nsolidarity with those communities (2008). Western conceptions of body\nand mind are different from Native American conceptions, and the\nhistory of colonization has made these differences especially complex\nto disentangle. Disability dialogues on a global scale would benefit\nfrom the engagement of indigenous voices, and the situation of\ndisabled indigenous persons would improve with their inclusion (2017).\nWith Carol Locust, Lovern explores the necessary translation work\namong cultures to work toward greater understanding, explicating\nNative American conceptions of difference (Lovern & Locust 2013).\nIn another significant example, Devi Mucina writes from the indigenous\nUbuntu perspective of South Africa; his work engages disability,\nincluding developmental disability, storytelling, and Blackness (e.g.,\n2010). \nPostcolonial theorists working in critical disability theory deal with\ncolonization and neo-colonization, treating disability within that\ncontext. As we have already seen, indigenous disability scholars are\ndealing with the tangled impacts of colonization. Postcolonial\nscholars seek to decolonize disability by centering the global South,\nchallenging neo-colonialism in capitalism, culture, and discourse, and\nre-engaging questions of disability from a diversity of cultures (cf.\nMeekosha & Shuttleworth 2009: 54). For instance, Shaun Grech\ndetails the export of Western disability studies, noting that this\nsilences the majority of disabled people who live in the global South.\nGrech uncovers and critiques the related ways that the projects of\nneoliberal development are enacted on this global South majority\n(2011). In another notable instance, Fiona Kumari Campbell engages an\nimplicit critique of Western disability studies in Contours of\nAbleism (2009). As Dan Goodley writes in the book’s\nforeword, “Campbell not only takes to task ableism, she grabs it\nkicking and screaming from its perch aboard the good ship Empire and\ntears it apart” (2009: ix). \nThis section provides key examples of work in the field of philosophy\nthat contributes to and draws from critical disability theory. One\nsub-section tracks the influence of Michel Foucault, who is\nsignificant in critical disability theory, and the second sub-section\ncaptures multiple threads of analyses rooted in Continental philosophy\nthat contribute to discursive, carnal, and psychic threads of critical\ndisability theory. \nThe work of French philosopher Michel Foucault, especially its\npurchase in historicizing concepts and analyzing power, is trenchant\nin critical disability theory. This sub-section provides key examples\nof Foucauldian approaches in critical disability theory. \nFor example, Shelley Tremain’s edited collection, Foucault\nand the Government of Disability (2005), brings together\ninterdisciplinary, international work on disability from a variety of\ntheorists who use Foucauldian approaches. In the introduction to that\nvolume, Tremain writes,  \nThe collection is a response to Foucault’s call to question what\nhas been regarded as natural, inevitable, ethical, and liberating;\nhence, contributions to this collection draw on Foucault in order to\nscrutinize a range of widely endorsed practices and ideas surrounding\ndisability, including rehabilitation, community care, impairment,\nnormality and abnormality, inclusion, prevention, genetic counseling,\naccommodation, and special education. (2005: 2–3).  \nTremain argues that Foucault’s concepts of biopower and the\nsubject are “indispensable” in the analysis of disability,\nwhich in turn relate to his central concepts of government, or the\nconduct of conduct, and liberalism. This implies that disability is\ncentral to both of these concepts (2005: 7). \nA Foucauldian approach follows through on efforts in critical\ndisability theory to challenge the distinction between impairment and\ndisability. Tremain argues that the social model, embedded in\ntraditional disability studies and in the thinking of U.K. activists,\nfails because it strongly distinguishes between impairment and\ndisability (2005: 9). For Tremain, impairment is not natural,\nvalue-neutral, and objective but rather is “historically\nspecific and performative” (2017: 115, cf. 2005: 11). Along\nthese lines, Tremain works to undermine, defamiliarize, and\ndenaturalize terminology like “people with disabilities”,\nhierarchies of “severity” among impairments, the\nterminology of impairment itself, and type or kind distinctions among\ndisabilities (e.g., physical or intellectual, among other similar\nterms) (2017). For her, impairment, like disability, is the product of\npower relations. Just as Judith Butler claims that sex is\nperformatively constituted through gender, Tremain leverages Foucault\nto make the same claim about the relationship between disability and\nimpairment (2017: 115, cf. Tremain 2001). She writes,\n“impairment has been disability—or rather, an element of\nthe apparatus of disability—all along” (2017: 93). Indeed,\naccording to Tremain, we should not be surprised that impairment\nitself is historical as “the shifting limits and borders of the\nclassification of impairment demonstrate its historicity and cultural\nspecificity” (2017: 93). \nTremain uses Foucault’s theoretical approach to articulate a\nfeminist philosophy of disability. On this view disability is both\nrelative and historical (2017). Among other innovations, Tremain\nintroduces the concept of ableist exceptionism, which marks off\ndisability as a-political, even while philosophers and other theorists\nof all stripes thoroughly politicize and problematize other identity\ncategories (2017: 33–34). Along these lines, she analyzes work\nin feminist philosophy, philosophy, and the milieu of higher education\nfor its exclusions, which replicate the idea that disability is an\nindividual, biological matter (2017: 30). \nUse of Foucault varies within critical disability theory, and so there\nare other key Foucauldian contributions to thinking about disability.\nLicia Carlson uses a Foucauldian genealogy to construct a history of\nintellectual disability, demonstrating that intellectual disability is\ncontingent and constructed, and challenging long-standing beliefs in\nphilosophy and ethics about its meaning and implications (2009, see\nalso Carlson 2001). Nirmala Erevelles uses Foucault’s treatment\nof Pierre Riviere to frame debate over facilitated communication used\nby autistic students; using this comparison, she leverages Foucault to\nsuggest that the human subject is fictional, therefore disrupting the\nquestion of whether or not a person considered mentally disabled can\nself-represent (2002). Aimi Hamraie, whose feminist work in critical\ndisability theory focuses on access, technology, and universal design\n(e.g., 2017), employs Foucault to outline a historical epistemological\napproach to disability (2015). Joshua St. Pierre, whose critical work\nfocuses on speech disabilities (2013, 2015a, 2015b), uses Foucault to\nsituate Speech-Language Pathology as a governing discourse intended to\nbring speech under biopower (St. Pierre & St. Pierre 2018). The use of Foucault in these contexts does not go without critique. For example, Bill Hughes argues against the use of Foucauldian analysis in disability theory\n(2005). \nCritical thinkers frequently use Foucault to assess, analyze, and\nreconsider topics in bio-medical ethics tightly connected to\ndisability. Catherine Mills critically intervenes in bioethics using a\nlargely Foucauldian approach, tackling topics such as reproduction,\ngenetic screening, and selective termination (2008, 2011, 2013,\n2015). Melinda C. Hall uses Foucault’s genealogical and\nbiopolitical frameworks, including his concept of vile sovereignty, to\nreframe bioethical debate over human enhancement (2013, 2016). She\nargues that disability, the refusal of disabled futures, and the\nreduction of political and social questions to biological registers\nundergirds transhumanist desires to achieve posthumanity\n(2016). Marilou Gagnon, in the field of nursing, critically assesses\nseclusion rooms, public health campaigns, HIV, and telecare using\nFoucault’s theoretical structure of sovereign power and\ngovernance (Gagnon, Jacob, & Holmes 2010; Gagnon & Stuart\n2008; Guta, Gagon, & Jacob 2012; and Jacob, Gagnon, Perron, &\nHolmes 2009). \nEllen Feder regularly employs a Foucauldian approach, especially using\nFoucault’s concept of biopower, to intervene in bioethics\ndiscourse and make progress in analyzing the family, gender identity,\nintersex issues, race, and shame surrounding the body, all of which\nare of serious interest in critical disability theory (1997, 2000,\n2007, 2009, and 2014). Catherine Clune-Taylor uses Foucault to\ncritically examine and treat evolving understandings of intersex and\nsex development, intervening upon treatment protocols, conversion\ntherapy, and reductive understandings of evolution and gender (2010;\nsee also Clune-Taylor 2016). Alice Dreger, too, has employed Foucault\nto theorize intersex (1998). Feder has also used concepts derived from\nother Continental philosophers, including Bourdieu’s habitus, to\nconsider the impact of normalization on parent-child relationships in\ncases where children present atypical genitalia (2006). Feder argues\nthat representations of sexual difference structure reality and become\npart of shared ideology, rendering it difficult to recognize evidence\nthat complicates common understandings of sexual difference (2006:\n191). \nFoucault’s work, and so Foucauldian approaches, are a popular\nobject of the kind of critique Vehmas and Watson (2014) use to target\ncritical disability theory as a whole. Critics commonly suppose that\nFoucault lacks the necessary ground to make normative claims, as he\nrefuses to distinguish normatively among various forms of power (e.g.,\nFraser 1989: 31 and 33). Hall responds to this frequent critique,\nwriting,  \nFoucault’s refusal to engage in normative theorizing has\nnormative implications; it allows one to see what has been\nobfuscated—for example, power’s productive\nfunctions—and thus reframe ethics by overthrowing previous\nnormative presuppositions. (M. Hall 2015: 162)  \nIndeed, Foucault directly described his work as moral. In an\ninterview, Foucault said,  \nIn a sense, I am a moralist, insofar as I believe that one of the\ntasks, one of the meanings of human existence—the source of\nhuman freedom—is never to accept anything as definitive,\nuntouchable, obvious or immobile. (Foucault 1988: 1, as quoted in M.\nHall 2015: 162) \nOther Continental methods significantly impact critical disability\ntheory. This section demonstrates the range of that work by briefly\npresenting the use of phenomenology, existentialism, Deleuze and\nGuattari, and psychoanalysis in critical disability theory. Of course,\nthis section is not exhaustive. \nPhenomenology, including questions of ontology, hermeneutics, and life\nwriting, is one critical approach taken within disability studies. For\ninstance, Tanya Titchkosky and Rod Michalko argue that framing\ndisability as a “problem” generates a restrictive\ndiscourse, specifically, the “requirement for explanation and\namelioration, but little else” (2012: 127). They use a\nphenomenological approach to analyze this framing, which otherwise\ngoes “completely unexamined” (ibid.). The authors\nwrite,  \nThis approach permits us to ask, what sort of problem do contemporary\ntimes need disability to be? And, what is the meaning of human\nembodiment that grounds the unquestioned status of disability as a\nproblem? (ibid.)  \nPhenomenology thus allows Titchkosky and Michalko to push back against\nwhat Edmund Husserl refers to as “ruling concealment” and\nto take advantage of a politically powerful alliance between\nphenomenology and disability studies that uses disability as the\n“scene where we can frame how we experience embodied\nexistence” (2012: 141). \nLife writing is a practice informed by phenomenology. Susannah B.\nMintz contributes significantly to literature on disability and life\nwriting (e.g., 2007). She describes a “phenomenological\nturn” in disability studies, which reconnects analyses to the\nbody itself. Mintz seeks to push this opportunity further by\ntheorizing the skin and touch, radicalizing mindfulness and ethics of\ncare (2016). \nPhenomenology is used to counter dominant discourses in medicine, with\nsignificant impact on discussions of illness and health. Havi Carel\nhas written extensively on illness, life, and death from a\nphenomenological perspective, tackling questions of happiness, the\nusefulness of phenomenology in medicine, and the experience of illness\n(2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2016). Kevin Aho focuses primarily on\nphenomenology and mental health and launches new ways of thinking\nabout, for example, medicalization (2008), the body (Aho & Aho\n2008), and depression (2013). Maureen Connolly, likewise, frequently\nturns to phenomenology in her analyses, including work on autism\n(2008) and embodiment (2001; Connolly & Craig 2002). \nAho’s work also engages existentialism; his edited volume,\nExistential Medicine: Essays on Health and Illness, presents\nphilosophical work on these topics influenced by Martin Heidegger,\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Hans-Georg Gadamer\n(2018). While these interventions point toward the health professions,\nthey engage the materiality of the body and the ontology of medicine,\nwhich in turn intertwine deeply with the theoretical efforts of\ncritical disability studies. Meanwhile, in Kierkegaard after the\nGenome, Ada Jaarsma uses Søren Kierkegaard’s\nexistentialism in a wide-ranging work seeking to materialize and\npoliticize belief in bio-political, scientific spaces, including\nplacebos and epigenetics. Her work draws together critical race and\ncrip theory with Kierkegaard’s concepts of freedom and despair\n(2017). \nFrench philosophers and collaborators Gilles Deleuze and Félix\nGuattari have significantly influenced work in critical disability\ntheory, especially with regard to materialism and subjectivity. Rosi\nBraidotti (1994, 2002, 2006), Kelly Fritsch (2010), Dan Goodley\n(Goodley & Lawthom 2011; Goodley, Liddiard, & Runswick Cole\n2018), Daniela Mercieca and Duncan Mercieca (2010), Griet Roets (Roets\n& Braidotti 2012), and others have used\n“DeleuzoGuattarian” concepts, including assemblages,\nintensities, and a distinctive approach to materiality in order to\ntheorize disability. In this view, an “assemblage”\ndescribes an ontological network in which component parts remain fluid\nin the roles they play in a larger whole; assemblages include\n“contingent formations” and “desiring forces”\n(Fritsch 2010: 3 cf. Deleuze & Guattari 1980 [1987]). This means\nthat a challenge is issued to the “normative sovereign able\nbody” that is supposedly independent (Fritsch 2010: 3). This\nchallenge can be a rallying cry in disability theory. According to\nFritsch,  \ndisabled people are entangled in multiple assemblages: the\nhuman-machine assemblages of wheelchairs, ventilators, or walkers;\nhuman-animal assemblages such as assistive animals like guide dogs; or\ndisabled-abled assemblages of the disabled person and care attendant.\n(2010: 3)  \nFritsch cautions that this does not mean disabled people are unique;\nrather, assemblages fruitfully re-describe ontology, including those\nconsidered abled and non-abled (2010: 3). These re-descriptions can\nhelp build an “intercorporeal and relational ethics that has\nrepercussions for all beings” (2010: 3).  \nRecall that critical disability theory challenges the distinction\nbetween impairment and disability, a distinction common in more\ntraditional disability studies (e.g., Shakespeare 2006). As we have\nseen, Foucauldian approaches are used to critique this distinction.\nRoets and Braidotti, meanwhile, use Deleuze and Guattari to push back\nagainst this distinction, especially the ways in which it forces a\nconception of impairment as negative, tragic, and individual. They\nattempt to balance a Deleuzian-inspired materialism with regard to the\nbody with the political goals of disability studies (2012). On a\nDeleuzoGuattarian perspective, “materiality” can be viewed\nas “plural, open, complex, uneven, and contingent” a view\nthat opens up opportunities for this balance to be achieved (Goodley,\nLiddiard, & Runswick Cole 2018: 203). \nNew approaches in psychoanalysis, including strategies employing the\npsychoanalysis of Julia Kristeva, offer further critical resources to\ntheorizing disability. For instance, Josh Dohmen uses a version of\nKristeva’s theory of abjection, transformed by engagement with\nSara Ahmed and Tina Chanter, to understand disability exclusion.\nDespite controversy over elements of Kristeva’s work for\nthinking disability, Dohmen argues that this Kristevean account is\npreferable to the Lacanian analyses found elsewhere in disability\nstudies (2016). Meanwhile, Kristeva herself directly engages her\nconcepts in scholarship around disability, laying out a politics of\nvulnerability (e.g., Kristeva & Herman 2010). Minae Inahara uses\nLuce Irigaray as a springboard to push back against the entrenched\nableism and masculinism of Freud and Lacan and build a psychoanalytic\nunderstanding of physical disability (2009). \nHowever, psychoanalytic approaches favored in philosophy circles are\nin some tension with challenges to psychology found elsewhere in\ncritical disability theory. One important component of critical\ndisability theory is increased attentiveness to mental illness and\ncritique of received frames for understanding and analyzing mental\nillness. For example, to overcome the dualism endemic in more\ntraditional disability studies, Margaret Price has coined the\nformulation “bodyminds” to capture the full embodiment\nthat interests her in her work and to deal with the question of pain\n(2015). Price’s Mad at School: Rhetorics of Mental\nDisability and Academic Life (2011), challenges the focus of\ntraditional disability studies on disabled bodies at the expense of\ndisabled minds. Price argues that academic culture is produced by and\nassumes an abled mind and tracks the impact of mental disabilities in\nhigher education (2011). \nFor theorists working in mad studies (e.g., Mollow 2013 and 2014) and\ncritical psychology studies (e.g., Weiner 2005a, 2005b, and Wiener,\nRibeiro, & Warner 2009), it is important to redevelop\npsychoanalytic approaches in their entirety to make them fit for these\nkinds of analyses and to break open new modes of thinking. Some\nthinkers find affect theory a fruitful location for challenging\npathologization. For instance, Goodley, Liddiard, and Runswick Cole\nfind it so, writing,  \nThe affective register is always a cultural and embodied register and\nit is here that we might find moments of resistance as young people\nconnect with others to contest normative ideas that assume their\nincompetence and emotional immaturity. (2018: 213) \nGiven the deep relationship in critical disability approaches between\ntheory and praxis, this entry closes with a direct discussion of\nactivism, including influential individual activists, along with their\nprojects, and collectives doing significant work. Activism around\ncritical disability theory engages a variety of topics, from\nimmigration and unjust hiring practices to ableism and storytelling.\nBecause of the material impacts of oppression, including economic\noppression, and exclusions in higher education, many of these\nactivists use popular web platforms, including social media, to engage\nin their advocacy and disseminate their work. Online efforts, policy\npromotion, and advocacy are covered to indicate efforts currently\nundertaken by those working under the critical disability theory\numbrella. \nCritical disability activism is conducted publicly through online\nforums. Education, writing, and advocacy tools are offered online, in\naddition to critical analysis of politics, news, history, and ideas.\nIndividual activists and collectivists offer these tools and writings\nand often crowdsource support, both material and intellectual.\nActivist Vilissa Thompson, the author of the blog Ramp Your\nVoice!, is deeply engaged at the intersection of critical race\nand disability theory, writing, collecting and disseminating\nscholarship and doing advocacy work embedded at this nexus. According\nto the blog’s mission statement, Ramp Your Voice!\nfosters self-advocacy and offers educational tools and services,\nincluding workshops and public speaking supporting disabled people,\nincluding, especially, disabled girls and women of color. Thompson\nalso offers the blog as a platform for writing by disabled people. \nActivist Alice Wong leads the Disability Visibility Project. The project\nmission, since its founding in 2014, is to provide online space\n“dedicated to recording, amplifying, and sharing disability\nmedia and culture” (Disability Visibility Project).\nWong focuses on collecting oral history and collaborates in this work\nwith her DVP’s partner organization, StoryCorps. Influential\nwriter Mia Mingus maintains a blog promoting critical disability\nactivism, Leaving Evidence, and was formerly the coordinator\nof Black Girl Dangerous, which still serves as an important\nonline archive of critical intersectional work and a springboard for\nactivism. \nPhilosopher Shelley Tremain regularly blogs in online forums,\nexamining political and social matters relevant to disability. She\nfocuses especially on issues for disabled persons in academia, with\nspecific attention to philosophy. To date, Tremain has conducted 50\ninterviews with disabled, queer, and POC academic philosophers about\ntheir experiences, their subject positions, and how ableism impacts\ntheir work. This series of interviews, called “Dialogues on\nDisability”, is a significant public philosophy project. First\nhosted on the blog Discrimination and Disadvantage, the full\narchive and new interviews can now be found on the blog\nBIOPOLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. Together with Tremain’s other\npublic writings, and the other writing available from a variety of\nscholars on both blogs, the Dialogues on Disability project\nconstitutes an archive that raises the profile of issues facing\ndisabled academics while at the same time exploring\ncritical-theoretical and intersectional work on disability. \nLydia X. Z. Brown, an activist, community organizer, and legal\nadvocate, maintains a network of internet resources and blog under the\nname Autistic Hoya. Autistic Hoya is a crucial\nresource on ableism, language, and the experiences and activist work\nof disabled and queer POC. It is also a jumping-off point for fighting\nagainst institutionalization alongside Brown, including the Judge\nRotenberg Educational Center. JRC uses the “graduated electronic\ndecelerator”, which causes electric shocks, to control behavior\n(Bruno 2016). Autistic Hoya, thanks to Brown’s\nscholarly labor and activism, is a significant public archive for\ncritical disability theory activism. Significant online resources\nbeyond these examples exist. Meanwhile, critical disability theorists\nwork to influence policy, dealing with topics from\ninstitutionalization to social services to law. Brown, a lawyer, is\nJustice Catalyst Fellow at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\nIn this role, they support  \nthe educational civil rights of Maryland students with psychosocial,\nintellectual, and developmental disabilities facing various forms of\ndisproportionate discipline, restraint and seclusion, and school\npushout. \n (Autistic Hoya, Sept. 23, 2019) \n \nBrown served as Chairperson of the Massachusetts Developmental\nDisabilities Council from 2015–2017, is a founding board member\nof the Alliance for Citizen-Directed Services, and is a board member\nof the Autism Women’s Network. Brown was a Fellow with the\nNational LGBTQ Task Force, and has worked for the Autistic Self\nAdvocacy Network, among other key roles and grassroots activism\n(Autistic Hoya). In all of these ways, Brown has sought to\ndirectly influence policy using a critical disability approach. \nFinally, direct advocacy on behalf of disabled people, both personal\nand political, is a key part of critical disability activism. Wong, a\nformer U.S. presidential appointee to the National Council on\nDisability, is a significant advocate. She works with\nDisabledWriters.com, promoting the careers of disabled writers and\njournalists, and #CripTheVote, a non-partisan movement to put\ndisability on political agendas and mobilize disabled people. Brown,\nalong with Morénike Giwa Onaiwu, directs the Fund for Community\nReparations for Autistic People of Color’s Interdependence,\nSurvival, and Empowerment. This fund supports autistic people of color\ndirectly and materially, and is just one of many ways Brown extends\ntheir influence in order to advocate for individual disabled\npeople. \nCommunity activism also occurs through collectives. These collectives\naccomplish key foundational work that allows access to fundamental\ninformation, communication, and activism around oppression, including\nbut not limited to police brutality, inaccessibility, and hermeneutic\ninjustice. A (non-exhaustive) list of notable examples include: the\nHarriet Tubman Collective, a group of black Deaf and disabled\nactivists; Helping Educate to Advance the Rights of Deaf Communities;\nKrip-Hop Nation, founded by Leroy F. Moore Jr., which includes\ndisabled hip hop artists and lifts the voices of disabled African\nAmericans in music and media; the National Black Disability Coalition,\na U.S. national organization founded in 1990 for black disabled\npeople; the National Coalition for Latinxs with Disabilities, a U.S.\nnational organization for individuals who identify as Latinx and\ndisabled; and, Rooted in Rights, a project of Disability Rights\nWashington that focuses on disability rights issues using videos and\nsocial media. “Storytellers” for Rooted in Rights\nparticipate internationally, broadening the scope of its impact. \nThe links to the websites, blogs, and online spaces highlighted in\nthis section are collected under the heading\n “Other Internet Resources”,\n below. This section is mostly limited to North American and\nEnglish-language examples; suggestions to expand its scope, addressed\nto the author of this entry, are welcome. \nCritical disability theory is a diverse set of approaches that largely\nseek to theorize disability as a cultural, political, and social\nphenomenon, rather than an individualized, medical matter attached to\nthe body. In this way, it shares goals with traditional disability\nstudies. But, additionally, critical disability theory actively seeks\nalliances and has produced work in conversation with other key areas\nof critical thought: critical race theory, postcolonial theory, queer\ntheory, and Continental philosophy, among other strategies. It also\nreflexively considers the exclusions, framing, and normative\npresuppositions of disability studies, favoring intersectional\napproaches and expansive inclusion. Critical disability theory\npresumes that those persons to whom the label “disability”\nattaches share in overlapping and intensifying oppressions with\npathologized and devalued persons in circumstances not readily\nrecognized as “disabled” (Minich 2016). As Schalk puts it,\n \nOne can study disabled people and not be doing critical disability\nstudies and one can be doing critical disability studies and not be\ndirectly studying disabled people. (2017)  \nIn this way, critical disability theory is interested, too, in topics\nnot readily recognized as of concern for disability studies, including\n(for example):  \nprotests against racialized disparities in health, education, and\npolicing; struggles for environmental justice and reproductive\nfreedom; HIV/AIDS and fat activism; the writings of Audre Lorde on\nblindness and cancer and of Gloria Anzaldúa on early\nmenstruation and diabetes. (Minich 2016) \nAs demonstrated here, critical disability theory is a developing\ndiscipline with blurry boundaries and actively emerging new work.\nIndeed, some suggest that offering a literature review of work in this\narea is premature (Dunhamn et al., 2015; Meekosha & Shuttleworth\n2009: 48). This entry nevertheless outlines work currently occurring\nunder the umbrella of critical disability theory, its signature\napproaches, and key debates. There is room here for the significant\nshifts in terminology and attention to new topics one should expect\nfrom this politically responsive and intersectional field actively\ndeveloping coalitions across boundaries. Difficulties emerge, too,\nincluding what Nirmala Erevelles calls the “complex cultural\npriorities” of such an enterprise. As she puts it, these\n“complex cultural priorities” include  \nthe range of disability conditions (e.g., neurological, psychological,\nphysical, cognitive) that the field of disability studies purports to\nrepresent in addition to the diversity of the disabled community\naround the axes of race, class, gender, and sexuality. (Erevelles\n& Kafer 2010: 212)  \nTheorists explicitly invite conversations about future directions of\ncritical disability theory (e.g., Minich 2016).","contact.mail":"mchall@stetson.edu","contact.domain":"stetson.edu"}]
