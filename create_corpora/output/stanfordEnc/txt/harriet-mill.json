S. Mill ([MOL], 216)\n\n\n\n\nHarriet Taylor Mill (1807–1858) poses a unique set of problems\nfor an encyclopedist. The usual approach to writing an entry on a\nhistorical figure, namely presenting a straightforward summary of her\nmajor works and then offering a few words of appraisal, cannot be\ncarried out in her case. This is because she worked in such close\ncollaboration with John Stuart Mill that it is exceedingly difficult\nto disentangle her contributions to the products of their joint effort\nfrom his. In attempting to assess Taylor Mill’s philosophical\ncareer, one encounters sharply conflicting reports about her ability\nfrom people who knew her, contradictory evidence about what works\nbelong to her corpus as an author, and widely varying judgments about\nhow much influence she exerted on Mill’s thought and work.\n\n\n\n\nThe woman who is today most commonly known as Harriet Taylor or\nHarriet Taylor Mill was born Harriet Hardy in London in October\n 1807.[1]\nShe married the pharmaceuticals wholesaler John Taylor on 14 March\n1826; she was eighteen and he thirty nine. The couple had three\nchildren: Herbert, born in 1827; Algernon (“Haji”), born\nin 1830; and Helen (“Lily”), born in 1831. John Taylor\ndied of rectal cancer in 1849, and in the spring of 1851 Harriet was\nmarried again, this time to John Stuart Mill. She suffered from\nvarious health problems affecting her nervous and respiratory\nsystems. In 1841, for instance, she lost much of the use of her legs\nfor an extended period (J. S. Mill, [TEL], 486–7). A tuberculosis\nsufferer, as was John—it is possible that she caught\n“consumption” from him (see Packe 1954, 360)—she\ndied of a respiratory failure on 3 November 1858. \nHarriet Taylor and John Stuart Mill met for the first time in\n1830. Their meeting was arranged by the leader of Harriet’s Unitarian\ncongregation, the Reverend W. J. Fox. The two young people very\nquickly fell in love. Their conduct during the long period in which\nHarriet was married to John Taylor would be scandalous by contemporary\nstandards, let alone Victorian ones. Early on, John Mill made almost\nnightly visits to the Taylors’ home, visits that John Taylor would\nfacilitate by going to his club. On the whole, John Taylor was\nremarkably tolerant of the fact that his wife was on such intimate\nterms with another man, but his tolerance did have some limits. In\n1833, at his insistence, Harriet established a separate residence, and\nshe lived apart from her husband for most of the rest of his life,\nseeing John at her convenience. (Helen lived with her, Herbert and Haji\nwith their father.) In 1848, John Taylor refused to allow John Mill to\ndedicate The Principles of Political Economy to Harriet,\nalthough the dedication was nonetheless inserted into special copies\nof the book that they distributed to friends. When John Taylor\nbegan to suffer from the cancer that would eventually take his life,\nhe asked Harriet to return home to care for him. She declined, on\nthe grounds that her first duty was to John Mill, who at the time was\nhimself suffering from an injured hip and temporary\nnear-blindness. While John Mill eventually mended, John Taylor’s\ncondition only worsened, and at the end Harriet did dedicate herself\nto caring for her husband. In fact, she rebuked John Mill very sharply\nfor having failed, while visiting her, to ask about her husband’s\nhealth. She upbraided him even more severely for having suggested that\nshe might write to him during an “odd time” when she might\nfind a “change of subject of thought a relief”:\n“Good God, sh[oul]d you think it a relief to think of something\nelse some acquaintance or what not while I was dying?”\n(H. T. Mill, [CW], 360). \nHarriet was widowed in 1849, and she married John Mill in 1851. The Mills spent most of their married life in their Blackheath Park\nhome, with just Haji and Helen Taylor for company. They had already\nlargely withdrawn from society, perhaps due to the gossip that their\nrelationship generated. Real or perceived slights toward Taylor Mill\nby Mill’s mother and some of his siblings after their wedding\nresulted in his estrangement from much of his family (on this see\nPacke 1954, 349–57; Jacobs 2002, 117). The Mills did sometimes\ninterrupt their reclusion to travel, separately or together, to the\nsouth of England or to the Continent in pursuit of a more healthful\nclimate. In late 1858, after Mill’s retirement from the East\nIndia Company, they set out for Montpellier, but Taylor Mill’s\nfragile health gave out in Avignon. Mill bought a small house there,\nnext to the cemetery in which she was buried, where he spent a\nconsiderable portion of the remainder of his life. (He died and was\nburied in Avignon in 1873.) \nHad Taylor Mill produced a substantial body of philosophical work that\ncould uncontroversially be called her own, we would not need to\nconcern ourselves with what her contemporaries had to say about her\nabilities; we could make our own assessment. Because she lacks such a\ncorpus, however, and because questions about what she might have\nwritten or how much influence she\nmight have had on Mill’s intellectual career are so difficult to\nanswer on purely textual grounds, the estimates of her intellectual\npowers formed by people who knew her must be taken into account. \nTaylor Mill’s contemporaries offer radically different impressions of\nher. Mill’s view is already fairly clear from the lines\nfrom the dedication to On Liberty that were quoted above, but\nthe description of her in his Autobiography is worth quoting\nin its entirety. \nThis passage and others like it lead Richard Reeves to \ndescribe Mill as having a “lifelong mission to deify\nHarriet” (2007, 206–7). \nNo one else who knew Taylor Mill personally spoke of her in anything like\nthese terms, as far as we know, and indeed several of her acquaintances\nheld her in low estimation. The Carlyles were admirers initially,\nbut they soon had changes of heart. Jane says that Harriet was\n“a peculiarly affected body” who “was not easy unless\nshe startled you with unexpected sayings” and was even\n“somewhat of a humbug” (quoted in Packe 1954, 325–6).\nThomas comments that “She was full of unwise intellect, asking\nand re-asking stupid questions” (quoted in Packe 1954,\n315). Harold Laski relates that “Morley told me that Louis\nBlanc told him that he once sat for an hour with her and that she\nrepeated to him what afterwards turned out to be an article that Mill\nhad just finished for the Edinburgh….\nIf she was what he thought, someone at least should have given us\nindications” (quoted in Stillinger 1961, 24–5). \nThose who argue that Taylor Mill was something less than what Mill\ntook her to be must explain how he was so misled.  There is a\ntradition of thinking that, in essence, he was psychologically unable\nto resist her charms. According to Mill’s friend and biographer\nAlexander Bain, it was commonly held among their contemporaries that\n“she imbibed all his views, and gave them back in her own form,\nby which he was flattered and pleased” (1882, 173). Ruth\nBorchard says that “Accustomed by training and experience to the\nacceptance of ascetic, masculine values, he was completely overpowered\nby her intensely feminine atmosphere” (1957, 46). And Laski\nspeculates: “I should guess that she was a comfortable and\nsympathetic person and that Mill, brought up to fight Austin, Praed,\nMacaulay and Grote, had never met a really soft cushion before.”\n(op. cit.). Some writers have even advanced the idea that\nafter the death of his domineering father James, Mill felt a need to\ninvent another parental authority in order that he might submit to it\n(e.g., Trilling 1952, 118; Mazlish 1975, 286–91). \nThere is obviously a vast middle territory between these extremes. Taylor Mill\nwas not often described in judicious or balanced terms. Nevertheless, \nMill’s brother George, who knew her reasonably well, did relate\nto Bain that “Mrs.  Taylor was a clever and remarkable woman,\nbut nothing like what John took her to be” (Bain 1882, 166). \nPhilosophical reputations are usually forged through producing a body\nof written work. This section will discuss various works of which\nTaylor Mill is or might be the author or at least a co-author,\nincluding three significant works in whose creation Mill credits\nTaylor Mill with playing a major role: The Principles of Political\nEconomy, On Liberty, and “The Enfranchisement of\nWomen.”  \nWhile there are several works of which it is possible to describe\nTaylor Mill as an author or co-author with little fear of\ncontradiction, Menaka Philips observes that none of them constitute\nwhat philosophers have traditionally regarded as a “great text” (2018,\n629). A handful of published pieces, such as some poems, book reviews,\nand an essay on the aesthetic appreciation of the seasons that were\npublished in the Monthly Repository in the early 1830s, when\nFox was its editor, have minimal philosophical content. The\nComplete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill, edited by Jo Ellen Jacobs,\ncontains various drafts of unpublished essays that are in Taylor\nMill’s hand on ethics and social philosophy; their topics\ninclude defenses of women’s rights and tolerance and criticisms\nof religion (Jacobs 1998). But while at points suggestive, these\npieces are also brief and indeed most are incomplete\nfragments. Although these drafts share thematic similarities with the\npublished works described in this section, as well as other works by\nMill such as The Subjection of Women and “The Utility of\nReligion,” they do not correspond closely with particular\nstretches of text in these published\nworks.[2] While\nlittle has been written about these drafts, commentators have offered\nconflicting assessments of their cogency and significance. (Compare,\nfor example, Michèle Le Doeuff’s (2003, 203–4) and\nK. C. O’Rourke’s (2001, 60–1) remarks on a draft of an\nessay on toleration and conformity, which is circa five pages in\nlength.) \nIn a bibliography that he compiled of his writings, Mill describes a\nnumber of newspaper articles that appeared from the middle of the\n1840s to the early 1850s—most comment on recent criminal\ntrials—as having been co-authored by himself and Taylor Mill\n(MacMinn et al. 1945, 59–76). Frequently, he adds that\nvery little of the article was his. In a like manner, he says in the\nentry for an 1853 pamphlet examining a proposed domestic violence bill\n“In this I acted chiefly as an amanuensis to my wife”\n(MacMinn et al. 1945, 79). One thread that runs through many\nof these occasional pieces is the suggestion that the law is\nexcessively harsh where the security of property is concerned yet\nexcessively lax when dealing with those who do violence to other\npersons, especially women and children. A newspaper article or short\npopular pamphlet is necessarily far from being a theoretical treatise,\nbut Philips (2018, 634) credits Taylor Mill with the\n“gritty” detail in which these co-authored pieces depict\nwomen’s lived experience from a theoretically-informed\nperspective.[3] \nMill suggests that Taylor Mill was deeply involved in the composition\nof three works of greater philosophical significance than those discussed\nabove. The earliest is the\nPrinciples of Political Economy. The Principles’\nsubtitle is With Some of their Applications to Social\nPhilosophy. At least a third of the volume is concerned with\ntopics that belong as much to philosophy as to economics, including\nthe portion of the work that Harriet did the most to shape, a chapter\ntitled “On the Probable Futurity of the Labouring Classes”\n(J. S. Mill, [PPE], 758–96). This chapter argues that when the\nlaboring class has made sufficient moral and intellectual progress,\nits members will refuse to settle for mere wages any longer. They will\ninstead insist first on profit-sharing and later on employee ownership\nof firms. They will even experiment with Socialist and Communist\ncommunities of the sorts depicted by Saint-Simon, Fourier, Blanc, and\nOwen. Mill’s\nAutobiography states that \nAs Jacobs reads this passage, Mill is declaring the chapter\n“to be written primarily by Taylor Mill” (2002, 207–8).\nThis gloss, though, seems to overlook his statement that “she was\nthe cause of my writing it.” Moreover, the aforementioned\n“forbidden dedication” of the volume refers without\nqualification to Mill as the author.  \nEven if the decision to put only Mill’s name on the cover of\nthe Principles could be explained as an expedient to win\ngreater acceptance for the ideas within, there would have been\nlittle harm in describing her as its co-author in this dedication if\nshe were such, especially once the decision was made only to paste it\ninside copies of the Principles given to personal\nfriends. On the other hand, though, his annotated bibliography\ndoes describe the Principles as a “joint production with\nmy wife” (MacMinn et al. 1945,\n 69).[4]\nAnd Taylor Mill was actively\ninvolved in revising portions of the later editions of the\nPrinciples. For example, the second (1849) edition is\nconsiderably more favorable to Socialism and even Communism, and the\nimpetus for this shift seems to have been a change in Taylor Mill’s\nthinking. In a letter written to Taylor Mill early in 1849, Mill\npoints out that she now “had marked dissent” from a passage\nin the first edition raising an objection to Communism that “was\ninserted on your proposition & very nearly in your own\nwords.” He continues, though, that \n\nThus while we can be confident that one important chapter of the Principles would not exist\nif not for Taylor Mill and that she helped to\nedit other chapters, it is unclear whether her role in the volume’s\ncomposition was substantial enough to merit calling her its\nco-author. It is not even entirely clear whether John thought of her\nas such, and if he did, whether this was true from the start or a\nretrospective judgment that he came to hold years\nlater.[5] \nThis brings us to On Liberty, the celebrated defense of\nindividual freedom, which was published in the year after\nTaylor Mill’s death. The dedication of this essay, a portion of\nwhich has already been quoted, says that “Like all that I have\nwritten for many years, it belongs as much to her as to me,” and\nin the Autobiography Mill elaborates on Taylor Mill’s role\nin the essay’s production. \n\nThe entry for On Liberty in Mill’s bibliography,\nthough, makes no mention of Taylor Mill (MacMinn et al. 1945,\n92). Since he used the term “joint product” in the\nbibliography for the Principles, it is somewhat curious that\nhe does not use it there for On Liberty as well.\nMill’s letters to Taylor Mill and others also speak equivocally to\nthe question of On Liberty’s production. In\nJanuary of 1855, Mill writes to Taylor Mill from Rome that he has decided\nthat a volume on liberty would be “the best thing to write &\npublish at present” (J. S. Mill, [TLL], 294). He asks her to\nlook at an essay on the subject that he had written in the preceding\nyear to see if it could serve as the basis for one part of this volume,\nand says that if her answer is yes and if his health allows “I\nwill try to write & publish it in 1856.” In this\nletter, he clearly suggests that he will be the one doing the\nwriting. (On Liberty in fact appeared in 1859.) In\na reference to this projected volume in a letter of the next month,\nthough, he says that “We must cram into it as much as possible of\nwhat we wish not to leave unsaid” (J. S. Mill, [TLL], 332).\nIn letters to others, he refers to the essay as his and to himself as\nthe one writing it (J. S. Mill, [TLL], 539, 581). \n“The Enfranchisement of Women,” published in The\nWestminster Review in 1851, is the best candidate for a\nsignificant philosophical work authored primarily or even solely by\nTaylor Mill (H. T. Mill, [CW], 51–73). Occasioned by a series of\nfeminist conventions in the United States, it makes a case not merely\nfor giving women the ballot but for “equality in all rights,\npolitical, civil, and social, with the male citizens of the\ncommunity” (H. T. Mill, [CW], 51). This essay contains many of\nthe same lines of argument as The Subjection of Women,\nwritten by Mill and published in 1869, although it expresses a\nsomewhat more radical view of gender roles than the later essay (see\nRossi 1970, 41–5). It maintains that the denial of political\nrights to women tends to restrict their interests to matters that\ndirectly impact the family, with the result that the influence of\nwives on their husbands tends to diminish the latter’s\nwillingness to act from public-spirited motives. Further, it contends\nthat when women do not enjoy equal educational rights with men then\nwives will impede rather than encourage their husbands’ moral\nand intellectual development. And it insists that competition for jobs\nwill prevent most of the problems that admitting women into the\nworkforce would putatively cause from materializing. All of these\npoints are common to “The Enfranchisement” and The\nSubjection. The major point of difference between the two is that\nwhile the Subjection rather notoriously suggests that the\nbest arrangement for most married couples will be for the wife to\nconcentrate on the care of the house and the children (J.S. Mill,\n[TSW], 297–8), a position that Mill also takes in an early essay\non marriage written for Harriet (J. S. Mill, [OMA], 43), the\n“Enfranchisement” instead argues for the desirability of\nmarried women’s working outside the home. \nThis difference is an important piece of evidence in favor of\nattributing the essay to Taylor Mill (although Richard Krouse points out\nthat the essay leaves unanswered the question it raises about who is to\ncare for the home and the children; see 1982, 169). Still, not all\nof the evidence is on this side. In 1849, Mill urges Taylor Mill to\nfinish a pamphlet that she was writing on the subject of women ([TLL],\n13). Yet soon thereafter, in correspondence with the\nWestminster’s editor about the “Enfranchisement,”\nhe speaks of the article as if he is its author, writing for instance\nthat “If you are inclined for an article on the Emancipation of\nWomen, … I have one nearly ready… ” ([TLL],\n55–6, 65–6). In an 1854 letter, Mill rather ambiguously\nreminds Taylor Mill that when the “Enfranchisement” is\npublished in a projected collection of his work it will be\n“preceded by a preface which will show that much of all my later\narticles, and all the best of that one, were, as they were, my\nDarling’s” ([TLL], 190). If we can draw any implication from\nthis, it seems to be that while the strongest arguments in the article were\ndue to Harriet, Mill was still the actual author. But the preface that\nactually appeared, in the collection of Mill’s writings published in\nhis lifetime (Dissertations and Discussions), suggests\n(albeit vaguely) that his contribution was somewhat smaller than this;\nthere he describes the essay as “hers in a particular sense, my\nshare in it being little more than that of an editor and\namanuensis” (J. S. Mill 1882, 93–4). (He adds that the\narticle’s authorship was “known at the time, and publicly\nattributed to her.”) In an 1851 letter to William Lloyd and\nHelen Benson Garrison, Lucretia Coffin Mott writes that she had\nreceived a copy of the essay from Harriet’s son Herbert and adds\n“The writer of it was a Mrs. Taylor a widow who has recently\nmarried J. S. Mill.… Part of it is from his pen. Indeed, she\nsays, he wrote it—he says, she wrote it”\n(Mott 2002, p. 209). \nDespite the conflicting evidence, today there seems to be a general\nconsensus that Harriet is the article’s primary author. It appears in\nthe University of Toronto’s Collected Works of John Stuart\nMill, but only in an appendix and under her name (H. T. Mill, \n[EW]). John Robson, the editor of Mill’s Collected Works,\nsays that “most of the evidence” favors attributing it to\nher (Robson 1984, lxxv). Some commentators do dissent from this view,\nhowever (for example, Himmelfarb, 183–6; Warnock 1996, xxxv). \nWhatever conclusions we reach about Taylor Mill’s authorship of the\nworks discussed in the preceding section, she might also have made\nimportant contributions to philosophy through changing the direction\nof Mill’s writing in consequential respects. This section discusses\nsome of the evidence for and against the proposition that she did\nso. \nMill himself speaks to the difficulty of separating his and\nTaylor Mill’s contributions to their collaboration in his\nAutobiography: \n\nHere Mill implicitly acknowledges that his hand most often held the\npen, but he also suggests that Taylor Mill contributed numerous ideas\nto works that he was solely or primarily responsible for\ncomposing. “In this wide sense,” he continues,\n“not only during the years of our married life, but during many\nof the years of confidential friendship which preceded it, all my\npublished writings were as much my wife’s work as mine; her share in\nthem constantly increasing as years advanced” ([ALE], 251). \nMill does give some indication, though, of his and Taylor Mill’s \nrelative strengths: \n\nIn contrast, Mill says that his own greatest powers to lie in\n“the uncertain and slippery intermediate region, that of theory,\nor moral and political science,” including “political\neconomy, analytic psychology, logic, philosophy of history,”\netc. Mill stresses both the reciprocity of their collaborative\nefforts and their different manners of reaching conclusions: \nMill acknowledges that Taylor Mill had very little to do with his\nfirst major work, A System of Logic (first published in\n1843), or with his discussions of the more technical aspects of\npolitical economy. Her areas of interest, clearly, were moral and\nsocial-political philosophy. Within these areas, though, Mill almost\nseems to suggest that his entire project is that of systematizing\nTaylor Mill’s insights and incorporating them within a utilitarian\nframework. \nJust as the people who knew Taylor Mill formed wildly divergent\nconclusions about her abilities, so too have different interpreters\nreached wildly different conclusions about the scope and significance\nof her influence on Mill. Some of Mill’s interpreters are skeptical\nthat Taylor Mill really made much difference to his\nwritings. H. O. Pappe, for example, questions\nwhether Taylor Mill introduced any substantial alterations whatsoever into\nthe pattern of Mill’s thought. \n\nSimilarly, Francis Mineka says that “Neither he nor his recent\nbiographers have convinced us that she was the originating mind behind\nhis work …” (1963, 306). More recently, Reeves writes\nthat “There is no reason to think that Mill’s views would have\nbeen substantially different had he ended up with, say, Lizzie [Eliza]\nFlower—although his life certainly would have been.”\n(2007, 86), and Kinzer states bluntly that Taylor Mill “did not\ndecisively alter the course of” Mill’s development (2007,\n111). \nAlice Rossi criticizes this “minimalist” approach to\nestimating Taylor Mill’s influence on Mill when she observes that\n“one senses in Mill scholars an unwitting desire to reject\nHarriet Taylor as contributing in any significant way to the vigor of\nMill’s analysis of political and social issues unless it\nincluded some tinge of sentiment or political thought the scholar\ndisapproved of, in which case the disliked element was seen as\nHarriet’s influence” (1970, 44 –5). Some\ncommentators, however, have inclined toward a “maximalist”\nstance. Chief among these is Jacobs, whose basic interpretative\napproach is to take Mill’s characterizations of Taylor Mill and\ntheir collaboration at face value, although she departs from this\npractice when she believes that there is evidence that Mill may not\nhave given Taylor Mill the full credit she was due. For example, in an\nunpublished essay Taylor Mill writes that \n\nJacobs takes this comment to establish that Taylor Mill is the\noriginator of Mill’s distinction between the logics of arts and\nsciences at the end of the System of Logic, and she accuses\nMill of having in this case understated Taylor Mill’s contribution to\none of his works (Jacobs 2002, 203n27; J. S. Mill, [SOL],\n 943–52).[7]\nAnd while\nMill states that Taylor Mill learned almost as much from him as he\nfrom her, Jacobs appears to think otherwise. In toting up the\nadvantages of the collaboration to each of them, she notes that\n“Harriet administered Mill’s daily life, nursed his ego, and\nprovided him with ideas.” In return, according to Jacobs, Mill\ngave Taylor Mill little more than Mary Ann Evans got for herself by\nbecoming George Eliot: she merely “acquired the freedom to write\nprovocative articles … and to be heard as a man, with\nseriousness and consideration” (Jacobs 2002, 129–31).  \nConservative historian Gertrude Himmelfarb also credits Taylor Mill\nwith having made a very significant difference to Mill’s\nphilosophical output, at least during one stage of his life. In\ncontrast to Jacobs, however, she maintains that this influence was\ndecidedly for the worse. She decries in particular Taylor Mill’s\neffect on Mill’s views on liberty, arguing that it was only when\nHarriet’s influence on him was at its peak that Mill embraced a\nsimplistic liberalism grounded on his sweeping and absolute liberty\nprinciple instead of a more nuanced political theory that treats\nliberty as an important value but one that can be limited by other\nvalues (Himmelfarb 1974, 208–72). (Himmelfarb’s maximalist\nreading clearly might be seen as a limit case of the approach that\nRossi challenges.) \nTo feel entirely confident about any judgment about how far Taylor\nMill influenced Mill, we would need not only access to her letters\nwhich were destroyed but recordings from inside their home at\nBlackheath. But as with the descriptions of Taylor Mill’s\ncharacter and ability discussed above, there is a wide middle ground\nbetween the minimalist and maximalist assessments. One\nintermediate view is that of Bain, who suggests that just as\nMill’s friend John Sterling “overflowed in suggestive\ntalk, which Mill took up and improved in his own way,” so Taylor\nMill might have done as well (1882, 173–4). Robson\ncomments that “[I]n what we have of her writings, Harriet\nconstantly has her eye on the future, even when criticizing the\npresent; she was a woman of dreams and aspirations, and she must\nconstantly have breathed into Mill a hopeful and expansive view of\nhuman possibilities” (1966,\n178).[8] \nWhat Bain seems to be suggesting is that Taylor Mill’s greatest\ncontribution to the Mills’ collaboration, apart from any writing\nthat she did herself, was to turn Mill’s attention to the\ndefense of a set progressive ideals and causes reflective of these\npossibilities: Socialism, women’s rights, individual liberty,\nand above all a “utopian” view of humanity’s\nimprovability. This is not necessarily to say that he held these\npositions just because she did, which he explicitly tells us was not\nthe case with women’s rights ([ALE], 253n). Nor must it mean\nthat she contributed little or nothing to the arguments by which he\ndefends them. Bain knew Mill extremely well, and even though he says\nthat his friend was under “an extraordinary hallucination as to\nthe personal qualities of his wife,” and “outraged all\nreasonable credibility in describing her matchless genius,” he\nis also adamant not only that Mill “was not such an egoist as to\nbe captivated by the echo of his own opinions” but also that he\nwould only have been stimulated by someone with “independent\nresources” who had a “good mutual understanding as to the\nproper conditions of the problem at issue” (1882,\n173–4). \nRecent work by feminist scholars also makes a strong case that Taylor\nMill may have influenced Mill’s work in more subtle and less\ndirect ways than commentators usually consider. Helen McCabe suggests\nthat Taylor Mill helped Mill “develop an emotional language that\nhad previously been alien to him … and made him acknowledge,\nface up to, and express his emotions”; she describes this as\n“the most profound influence anyone could have had” on\nMill, since it “made him into a much more human, sensitive and\nempathetic philosopher than he would otherwise have been”\n(McCabe 2017, 115). And Philips observes that Taylor Mill’s own\nexperience of patriarchy meant that she brought knowledge to her\ncollaboration with Mill that he could never have acquired on his own\n(Philips 2018).  No firm conclusions have been reached here as to what personal\nqualities Taylor Mill possessed, what if any philosophical works she\nauthored or co-authored, or how much influence she exercised over\nMill’s philosophical career. All that has been attempted is to\npresent the wide range of answers that have been given to these\nquestions. The available evidence may be too sparse and too\ncontradictory for us ever to arrive at definitive answers. Taylor Mill\nmay therefore be destined to remain an essentially contested figure in\nthe history of philosophy.","contact.mail":"demiller@odu.edu","contact.domain":"odu.edu"}]
