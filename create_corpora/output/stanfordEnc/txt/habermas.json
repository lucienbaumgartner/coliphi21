Bridging continental and Anglo-American\ntraditions of thought, he has engaged in debates with thinkers as\ndiverse as Gadamer and Putnam, Foucault and Rawls, Derrida and Brandom.\nHis extensive written work addresses topics stretching from\nsocial-political theory to aesthetics, epistemology and language to\nphilosophy of religion, and his ideas have significantly influenced not\nonly philosophy but also political-legal thought, sociology,\ncommunication studies, argumentation theory and rhetoric, developmental\npsychology and theology. Moreover, he has figured prominently in\nGermany as a public intellectual, commenting on controversial issues of\nthe day in German newspapers such as Die Zeit.\n\n\n\nHowever, if one looks back over his corpus of work, one can discern\ntwo broad lines of enduring interest, one having to do with the\npolitical domain, the other with issues of rationality, communication,\nand knowledge. (In what follows, unnamed citations refer to works by\nHabermas; quotations are from the English editions, where\navailable.)\n\n\n\nBorn outside Düsseldorf in 1929, Habermas came of age in\npostwar Germany. The Nuremberg Trials were a key formative moment that\nbrought home to him the depth of Germany's moral and political\nfailure under National Socialism. This experience was later reinforced\nwhen, as a graduate student interested in Heidegger's\nexistentialism, he read the latter's reissued Introduction to\nMetaphysics, in which Heidegger had retained (or more accurately,\nreintroduced) an allusion to the “inner truth and\ngreatness” of National Socialism (Heidegger 1959, 199). When\nHabermas (1953) publicly called for an explanation from Heidegger, the\nlatter's silence confirmed Habermas's conviction that the\nGerman philosophical tradition had failed in its moment of reckoning,\nproviding intellectuals with the resources neither to understand nor to\ncriticize National Socialism. This negative experience of the relation\nbetween philosophy and politics subsequently motivated his search for\nconceptual resources from Anglo-American thought, particularly its\npragmatic and democratic traditions. In moving outside the German\ntradition, Habermas joined a number of young postwar intellectuals such\nas Karl-Otto Apel (for Habermas's autobiographical sketch, see\n2005b, chap. 1; also Wiggershaus 2004). \n\nHabermas completed his dissertation in 1954 at the University of\nBonn, writing on the conflict between the absolute and history in\nSchelling's thought. He first gained serious public attention, at\nleast in Germany, with the 1962 publication of his habilitation,\nStrukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit (Structural\nTransformation of the Public Sphere; English ed., 1989), a detailed\nsocial history of the development of the bourgeois public sphere from\nits origins in the 18th century salons up to its\ntransformation through the influence of capital-driven mass media. In\nhis description of the salons we clearly see his interest in a\ncommunicative ideal that later would provide the core normative\nstandard for his moral-political theory: the idea of inclusive critical\ndiscussion, free of social and economic pressures, in which\ninterlocutors treat each other as equals in a cooperative attempt to\nreach an understanding on matters of common concern. As an ideal at the\ncenter of bourgeois culture, this kind of interchange was probably\nnever fully realized; nonetheless, it “was not mere\nideology” (1989, 160, also 36). As these small discussion\nsocieties grew into mass publics in the 19th century,\nhowever, ideas became commodities, assimilated to the economics of mass\nmedia consumption. Rather than give up on the idea of public reason,\nHabermas called for a socioinstitutionally feasible concept of public\nopinion-formation “that is historically meaningful, that\nnormatively meets the requirements of the social-welfare state, and\nthat is theoretically clear and empirically identifiable.” Such a\nconcept “can be grounded only in the structural transformation of\nthe public sphere itself and in the dimension of its development”\n(ibid., 244). His concluding sketch of such a concept (ibid., 244–48)\nalready contains in outline the two-level model of democratic\ndeliberation he later elaborates in his mature work on law and\ndemocracy, Between Facts and Norms (1996b; German ed.,\n1992b). \n\nHabermas's interest in the political subsequently led him to a\nseries of philosophical studies and critical-social analyses that\neventually appeared in English in his Toward a Rational\nSociety (1970) and Theory and Practice (1973b). Whereas\nthe latter consists primarily of reflections on the history of\nphilosophy, the former represents an attempt to apply his emerging\ntheory of rationality to the critical analysis of contemporary society,\nin particular the student protest movement and its institutional\ntarget, the authoritarian and technocratic structures that held sway in\nhigher education and politics. \n\nHabermas's critical reflection takes a nuanced approach to both sides\nof the social unrest that characterized the late sixties.  Although\nsympathetic with students' demand for more democratic participation\nand hopeful that their activism harbored a potential for positive\nsocial transformation, he also did not hesitate to criticize its\nmilitant aspects, which he labeled self-delusory and\n“pernicious” (1970, 48). In his critique of\ntechnocracy—governance by scientific experts and\nbureaucracy—he relied on a philosophical framework that\nanticipates categories in his later thought, minus the philosophy of\nlanguage he would work out in the 1970s. Specifically, Habermas\nsharply distinguished between two modes of action, “work”\nand “interaction,” which correspond to enduring interests\nof the human species (ibid., chap. 6). The former includes modes of\naction based on the rational choice of efficient means, that is, forms\nof instrumental and strategic action, whereas the latter refers to\nforms of “communicative action” in which actors coordinate\ntheir behaviors on the basis of “consensual norms” (ibid.,\n91–92). Habermas's distinction in effect appropriates the\nclassical Aristotelian contrast between techne and\npraxis for critical social theory (1973b, chap. 1). The result\nis a distinctively Habermasian critique of science and technology as\nideology: by reducing practical questions about the good life to\ntechnical problems for experts, contemporary elites eliminate the need\nfor public, democratic discussion of values, thereby depoliticizing the\npopulation (1970, chap. 6). The legitimate human interest in technical\ncontrol of nature thus functions as an ideology—a screen that\nmasks the value-laden character of government decisionmaking in the\nservice of the capitalist status quo. Unlike Herbert Marcuse, who\nregarded that interest as specific to capitalist society, Habermas\naffirmed the technical control of nature as a genuinely universal\nspecies-interest; pace Horkheimer and Adorno in their Dialectic\nof Enlightenment, the technical interest did not necessitate\nsocial domination. \n\nHabermas defended this philosophical anthropology most fully in his\nKnowledge and Human Interests (1971b; German ed., 1968b), the\nwork that represents his first attempt to provide a systematic\nframework for an interdisciplinary critical social theory. As Habermas\nconceived his task, he had to establish critical social theory as a\nrespectable, distinct form of knowledge, in large measure through a\nmethodological critique of the then-dominant positivist philosophy of\nscience and historicist hermeneutics. He thus develops a theory of\n“knowledge-constitutive interests” that are tied both to\n“the natural history of the human species” and to\n“the imperatives of the socio-cultural form of life,” but\nare not reducible to them (ibid., 168). \n\nThere are three knowledge-constitutive interests, each rooted in human\nexistence and expressed in a particular type of scientific or\nscholarly inquiry. The first is the “technical interest,”\nthe “anthropologically deep-seated interest” we have in\nthe prediction and control of the natural environment. This interest\nstructures modes of inquiry and knowledge-production in the\n“empirical-analytic” sciences, that is, the natural\nsciences and types of social science that aim at testable general\nexplanations (in contrast to the interpretive social sciences, which\naim at cultural understanding, and the\n“normative-analytic” sciences, such as rational choice\ntheory, which rely on formal modeling and deduction based on\ncounterfactual axioms; see 1988a, 43ff). As a deep-seated structure\nconstitutive of knowledge, the technical “interest” refers\nnot to the motivations of scientists or specific disciplinary aims,\nbut rather to a way of approaching nature and society as objects of\npossible knowledge: in tying knowledge-production to controlled\nobservation and methodical experimentation, the empirical-analytic\nsciences deploy basic species-capacities to master the natural world\nvia feedback-monitored instrumental action. To be sure, Habermas's\nanalysis relies heavily on a hypothetico-deductive model that was in\nserious trouble even as he wrote. But his core idea is arguably\nbroader in scope: the empirical-analytic sciences are distinguished by\ntheir treatment of the object domain as governed by predictable\nlaw-like regularities that allow for certain types of methodologically\ncontrolled techniques of inquiry that would be inappropriate for the\ninterpretive sciences. Thus the technical interest applies not only to\nsciences that promise technological benefits, but also to sciences\nlike paleontology. \n\nThe interpretive, or cultural-hermeneutic sciences, rest on a second,\nequally deep-seated “practical interest” in securing and\nexpanding possibilities of mutual and self-understanding in the\nconduct of life. These sciences presuppose and articulate modes of\naction-orienting (inter)personal understanding that operate within\nsocio-cultural forms of life and the grammar of ordinary\nlanguage. Human societies depend on such understanding, and the\ninterpretive competences that go with it, just as much as they depend\non mastering the natural environment. The hermeneutic sciences, then,\nbring methodical discipline to features of everyday interaction, and\nin that sense are on a par with the empirical-analytic sciences, which\nelevate everyday instrumental action to experimental method. By making\nthese first two cognitive interests explicit, Habermas seeks to go\nbeyond positivist accounts of the natural and social sciences. On his\nview, those accounts tend to ignore the role that deep-seated human\ninterests play in the constitution of possible objects of inquiry.\n \n\nIn making cognitive interests explicit, Habermas also engages in a\nkind of critical self-reflection, more precisely a methodological\nreflection that aims to free science from its positivist\nillusions. Such reflection exemplifies the third cognitive interest,\nthe emancipatory interest of reason in overcoming dogmatism,\ncompulsion, and domination. For scientific expressions of this\ninterest, he looked to Freudian psychology and a version of Marxist\nsocial theory. The status of the emancipatory interest, however, was\nproblematic from the start, for it conflated two kinds of critical\nreflection. Whereas his critique of positivism and theory of cognitive\ninterests involve reflective articulation of the formal structures of\nknowledge, Freudian and Marxist critique aim to unmask concrete cases\nof personal self-deception and social-political ideology (1973cd). Nor\nwas it clear that psychoanalysis provided an apt model of liberatory\nreflection in any case, as critics pointed out how the asymmetries\nbetween patient and analyst could not represent the proper\nintersubjective form for emancipation. These and other deficits of his\nanalysis posed a challenge for Habermas that would guide a decade-long\nsearch for the normative and empirical basis of critique. Whatever the\nbest path to the epistemic and normative basis for critique might be,\nit would have to pass a democratic test: that “in Enlightenment\nthere are only participants” (1973b, 44). Habermas will not\nresolve this methodological issue until a series of transitional\nstudies in the 1970s culminates in his mature systematic work, The\nTheory of Communicative Action (1984a/1987; German ed., 1981;\nhereafter cited as TCA). \n\nThat said, we can discern enduring features in Habermas's\nearly attempt at a comprehensive model of social criticism. As a theory\nof rationality and knowledge, his theory of knowledge-constitutive\ninterests is both pragmatic and pluralistic: pragmatic, inasmuch as\nhuman interests constitute knowledge; pluralistic, in that different\nforms of inquiry and knowledge emerge from different core interests. In\nKnowledge and Human Interests we can thus see the beginnings\nof a methodologically pluralistic approach to critical social theory,\nmore on which below. Besides the problems described above, however, the\nanalysis was hampered by a framework that still relied on motifs from a\n“philosophy of consciousness” fixated on the constitution\nof objects of possible experience—an approach that cannot do\njustice to the discursive dimensions of inquiry (1973cd; 2000; also\nMüller-Doohm 2000). In the 1970s Habermas set about a fundamental\noverhaul of his framework for critical theory (see McCarthy 1978). \n\nIn the period between Knowledge and Human Interests and\nThe Theory of Communicative Action, Habermas began to develop\na distinctive method for elaborating the relationship between a\ntheoretical social science of modern societies, on the one hand, and\nthe normative and philosophical basis for critique, on the other.\nFollowing Horkheimer's definition of Critical Theory, Habermas\npursued three aims in his attempt to combine social science and\nphilosophical analysis: it must be at once explanatory, practical, and\nnormative. This meant that philosophy could not,\nas it did for Kant, become the sole basis for normative reflection.\nRather, Habermas argued, adequate critique requires a thoroughgoing\ncooperation between philosophy and social science. This sort of\nanalysis is characteristic of Legitimation Crisis (1975;\nGerman ed., 1973e), in which Habermas analyzes the modern state as\nsubject to endemic crises, which arise from the fact that the state\ncannot simultaneously meet the demands for rational problem solving,\ndemocracy, and cultural identity. Here the social science to which\nHabermas appeals is more sociological and functional. Similarly, in\nthis work and in Communication and the Evolution of Society\n(1979), Habermas begins to develop a distinctive conception of rational\nreconstruction, which models societal development as a learning\nprocess. In these works, Habermas begins to incorporate the results of\ndevelopmental psychology, which aligns stages of development with\nchanges in the kinds of reasons that the maturing individual considers\nacceptable. Analogously, societies develop through similar changes in\nthe rational basis of legitimacy on the collective level. At this point\nin his theorizing, Habermas's appropriation of the social\nsciences has become methodologically and theoretically pluralistic: on\nhis view, a critical social theory is not distinctive in light of\nendorsing some particular theory or method but as uniting normative and\nempirical inquiry. \n\nIn this transitional phase from Knowledge and Human Interests\nto The Theory of Communicative Action, Habermas's basic\nphilosophical endeavor was to develop a more modest, fallibilist,\nempirical account of the philosophical claim to universality and\nrationality. This more modest approach moves Critical Theory away from\nits strong transcendental framework, exemplified in the theory of\ncognitive interests with the unmistakably Kantian language of\nobject-constitution. In setting that earlier project aside, Habermas\nadopts a more naturalistic, “postmetaphysical” approach\n(1992a), characterized by the fallible hermeneutic explication or\n\"reconstruction\" of shared competences and normative presuppositions\nthat allow actors to engage in familiar practices of communication,\ndiscourse, and inquiry. In articulating presuppositions of practice,\nreconstructive analysis remains weakly transcendental. But it also\nqualifies as a “weak naturalism” inasmuch as the practices\nit aims to articulate are consistent with the natural evolution of the\nspecies and located in the empirical world (2003a, 10-30, 83ff);\nconsequently, postmetaphysical reconstruction links up with specific\nforms of social-scientific knowledge in analyzing general conditions\nof rationality manifested in various human capacities and powers. \n\nHabermas's encounter with speech act theory proved to be\nparticularly decisive for this project. In speech act theory, he finds\nthe basis for a conception of communicative competence (on the model of\nChomsky's linguistic competence). Given this emphasis on\nlanguage, Habermas is often said to have taken a kind of\n“linguistic turn” in this period. He framed his first\nessays on formal pragmatics (1976ab) as an alternative to Niklas\nLuhmann's systems theory. Habermas understands formal pragmatics\nas one of the “reconstructive sciences,” which aim to\nrender theoretically explicit the intuitive, pretheoretical know-how\nunderlying such basic human competences as speaking and understanding,\njudging and acting. Unlike Kant's transcendental analysis of the\nconditions of rationality, reconstructive sciences yield knowledge that\nis not necessary but hypothetical, not a priori but empirical, not\ncertain but fallible. They are nevertheless directed to invariant\nstructures and conditions and raise universal, but defeasible claims to\nan account of practical reason. \n\nWith the turn to language and reconstructive science, Habermas\nundermines both of the traditional Kantian roles for philosophy:\nphilosophy as the sole judge in normative matters and as the\nmethodological authority that assigns the various domains of inquiry to\ntheir proper questions. In Habermas's view, philosophy must\nengage in a fully cooperative relationship with the social sciences and\nthe empirical disciplines in general. This step is completed in The\nTheory of Communicative Action, to which we now turn. \n\nTo understand Habermas's mature positions, we must start with\nhis Theory of Communicative Action (TCA), a\ntwo-volume critical study of the theories of rationality that informed\nthe classical sociologies of Weber, Durkheim, Parsons, and neo-Marxist\ncritical theory (esp. Lukács, Horkheimer,\nAdorno). In TCA we find Habermas's conception of the task of\nphilosophy and its relation to the social sciences—a conception\nthat still guides much of his work. While TCA defends the\nemphasis on normativity and the universalist ambitions found in the\nphilosophical tradition, it does so within a framework that includes\nparticular sorts of empirical social research, with which philosophy\nmust interact. Philosophers, that is, must cooperate with social\nscientists if they are to understand normative claims within the\ncurrent historical context, the context of a complex, modern society\nthat is characterized by social and systemic modes of integration. By\nrecognizing both modes of integration, one avoids the pessimism\nassociated with theories of modernity whose one-sided, primarily\ninstrumental conception of rationality misses the cultural dimension\nof modernization. \n\nStarting with Marx's historical materialism, large-scale\nmacrosociological and historical theories have long been held to be the\nmost appropriate explanatory basis for critical social science.\nHowever, such theories have two drawbacks for the critical project.\nFirst, comprehensiveness does not ensure explanatory power. Indeed,\nthere are many such large-scale theories, each with their own\ndistinctive and exemplary social phenomena that guide their attempt at\nunification. Second, a close examination of standard critical\nexplanations, such as the theory of ideology, shows that such\nexplanations typically appeal to a variety of different social theories\n(Bohman 1999). Habermas's actual employment of critical\nexplanations bears this out. His criticism of modern societies turns on\nthe explanation of the relationship between two very different\ntheoretical terms: a micro-theory of rationality based on communicative\ncoordination and a macro-theory of the systemic integration of modern\nsocieties through such mechanisms as the market (TCA, vol. 2).\nIn concrete terms, this means that Habermas develops a two-level social\ntheory that includes an analysis of communicative rationality, the\nrational potential built into everyday speech, on the one hand; and a\ntheory of modern society and modernization, on the other (White 1989).\nOn the basis of this theory, Habermas hopes to be able to assess the\ngains and losses of modernization and to overcome its one-sided version\nof rationalization. \n\nComprehensive critical theories make two problematic assumptions:\nthat there is one preferred mode of critical explanation, and that\nthere is one preferred goal of social criticism, namely a socialist\nsociety that fulfills the norm of human emancipation. Only with such a\ngoal in the background does the two-step process of employing\nhistorical materialism to establish an epistemically and normatively\nindependent stance make sense. The correctness or incorrectness of such\na critical model depends not on its acceptance or rejection by its\naddressees, but on the adequacy of the theory to objective historical\nnecessities or mechanisms (into which the critical theorist alleges to\nhave superior insight). A pluralistic mode of critical inquiry suggests\na different norm of correctness: that criticism must be verified by\nthose participating in the practice and that this demand for practical\nverification is part of the process of inquiry itself. \n\nAlthough Habermas's attitude toward these different modes of critical\ntheory is somewhat ambivalent, he has given good reasons to accept the\npractical, pluralist approach. Just as in the analysis of modes of\ninquiry tied to distinct knowledge-constitutive interests, Habermas\naccepts that various theories and methods each have “a relative\nlegitimacy.” Indeed, like Dewey he goes so far as to argue that\nthe logic of social explanation is pluralistic and eludes the\n“apparatus of general theories.” In the absence of any\nsuch general theories, the most fruitful approach to social-scientific\nknowledge is to bring all the various methods and theories into\nrelation to each other: “Whereas the natural and the cultural or\nhermeneutic sciences are capable of living in mutually indifferent,\nalbeit more hostile than peaceful coexistence, the social sciences\nmust bear the tension of divergent approaches under one roof”\n(1988a, 3). In TCA, Habermas casts critical social theory in\na similarly pluralistic, yet unifying way. In discussing various\naccounts of societal modernization, for example, he argues that the\nmain existing theories have their own “particular\nlegitimacy” as developed lines of empirical research, and that\nCritical Theory takes on the task of critically unifying the various\ntheories and their heterogeneous methods and\npresuppositions. “Critical social theory does not relate to\nestablished lines of research as a competitor; starting from its\nconcept of the rise of modern societies, it attempts to explain the\nspecific limitations and the relative rights of those\napproaches” (TCA, 2: 375). \n\nTo achieve these theoretical and methodological ends, Habermas\nbegins this task with a discussion of theories of rationality and\noffers his own distinctive definition of rationality, one that is\nepistemic, practical, and intersubjective. For Habermas, rationality\nconsists not so much in the possession of particular knowledge, but\nrather in “how speaking and acting subjects acquire and use\nknowledge” (TCA, 1: 11). Any such account is\n“pragmatic” because it shares a number of distinctive\nfeatures with other views that see interpreters as competent and\nknowledgeable agents. Most importantly, a pragmatic approach develops\nan account of practical knowledge in the “performative\nattitude,” that is, from the point of view of a competent\nspeaker. A theory of rationality thus attempts to reconstruct the\npractical knowledge necessary for being a knowledgeable social actor\namong other knowledgeable social actors. As already mentioned, Habermas's\nreconstruction attempts to articulate invariant structures of\ncommunication, and so qualifies as a “formal pragmatics.” \n\nWhat is the “performative attitude” that is to be\nreconstructed in such a theory? From a social-scientific point of view,\nlanguage is a medium for coordinating action, although not the only\nsuch medium. The fundamental form of coordination through language,\naccording to Habermas, requires speakers to adopt a practical stance\noriented toward “reaching understanding,” which he regards\nas the “inherent telos” of speech. When actors address one\nanother with this sort of practical attitude, they engage in what\nHabermas calls “communicative action,” which he\ndistinguishes from strategic forms of social action. Because this\ndistinction plays a fundamental role in TCA, it deserves some\nattention. \n\nIn strategic action, actors are not so much interested in mutual\nunderstanding as in achieving the individual goals they each bring to\nthe situation. Actor A, for example, will thus appeal to\nB's desires and fears so as to motivate the behavior on\nB's part that is required for A's success. As\nreasons motivating B's cooperation, B's desires and\nfears are only contingently related to A's goals. B\ncooperates with A, in other words, not because B\nfinds A's project inherently interesting or worthy, but\nbecause of what B gets out of the bargain: avoiding some\nthreat that A can make or obtaining something A has\npromised (which may be of inherent interest to B but for\nA is only a means of motivating B). \n\nIn communicative action, or what Habermas later came to call\n“strong communicative action” in “Some Further\nClarifications of the Concept of Communicative Rationality”\n(1998b, chap. 7; German ed., 1999b), speakers coordinate their action\nand pursuit of individual (or joint) goals on the basis of a shared\nunderstanding that the goals are inherently reasonable or merit-worthy.\nWhereas strategic action succeeds insofar as the actors achieve their\nindividual goals, communicative action succeeds insofar as the actors\nfreely agree that their goal (or goals) is reasonable, that it merits\ncooperative behavior. Communicative action is thus an inherently\nconsensual form of social coordination in which actors “mobilize\nthe potential for rationality” given with ordinary language and\nits telos of rationally motivated agreement.  \n\nTo support his conception of communication action, Habermas must\nspecify the mechanism that makes rationally motivated agreement\npossible. Toward that end, he argues for a particular account of\nutterance meaning as based on “acceptability conditions,”\nby analogy to the truth-conditional account of the meaning of\nsentences. But rather than linking meaning with representational\nsemantics, Habermas takes a pragmatic approach, analyzing the\nconditions for the illocutionary success of the speech act. According\nto the core principle of his pragmatic theory of meaning, “we\nunderstand a speech act when we know the kinds of reasons that a\nspeaker could provide in order to convince a hearer that he is entitled\nin the given circumstances to claim validity for his utterance—in\nshort, when we know what makes it acceptable” (1998b,\n232). With this principle, Habermas ties the meaning of speech acts to\nthe practice of reason giving: speech acts inherently involve claims\nthat are in need of reasons—claims that are open to both\ncriticism and justification. In our everyday speech (and in much of our\naction), speakers tacitly commit themselves to explaining and\njustifying themselves, if necessary. To understand what one is doing in\nmaking a speech act, therefore, one must have some sense of the\nappropriate response that would justify one's speech act, were\none challenged to do so. A speech act succeeds in reaching\nunderstanding when the hearer takes up “an affirmative\nposition” toward the claim made by the speaker (TCA 1:\n95–97; 282; 297). In doing so, the hearer presumes that the claims in\nthe speech act could be supported by good reasons (even if she has not\nasked for them). When the offer made by the speaker fails to receive\nuptake, speaker and hearer may shift reflexive levels, from ordinary\nspeech to “discourse”—processes of argumentation and\ndialogue in which the claims implicit in the speech act are tested for\ntheir rational justifiability as true, correct or authentic. Thus the\nrationality of communicative action is tied to the rationality of\ndiscourse, more on which in section 3.2. \n\nWhat are these claims that are open to criticism and justification?\nIn opposition to the positivist fixation on fact-stating modes of\ndiscourse, Habermas does not limit intersubjectively valid, or\njustifiable, claims to the category of empirical truth, but instead\nrecognizes a spectrum of “validity claims” that also\nincludes, at the least, claims to moral rightness, ethical goodness or\nauthenticity, personal sincerity, and aesthetic value (TCA 1:\n8–23; 1993, chap. 1). Although Habermas does not consider such claims\nto represent a mind-independent world in the manner of empirical truth\nclaims, they can be both publicly criticized as unjustifiable and\ndefended by publicly convincing arguments. To this extent, validity\ninvolves a notion of correctness analogous to the idea of truth. In\nthis context, the phrase “validity claim,” as a translation\nof the German term Geltungsanspruch, does not have the narrow\nlogical sense (truth-preserving argument forms), but rather connotes a\nricher social idea—that a claim (statement) merits the\naddressee's acceptance because it is justified or true in some\nsense, which can vary according to the sphere of validity and\ndialogical context. \n\nBy linking meaning with the acceptability of speech acts, Habermas\nmoves the analysis beyond a narrow focus on the truth-conditional\nsemantics of representation to the social intelligibility of\ninteraction. The complexity of social interaction then allows him to\nfind three basic validity claims potentially at stake in any speech act\nused for cooperative purposes (i.e., in strong communicative action).\nHis argument relies on three “world relations” that are\npotentially involved in strongly communicative acts in which a speaker\nintends to say something to someone about something (TCA 1:\n275ff). For example, a constative (fact-stating) speech act (a)\nexpresses an inner world (an intention to communicate a belief); (b)\nestablishes a communicative relation with a hearer (and thus relates to\na social world, specifically one in which both persons share a piece of\ninformation, and know they do); and (c) attempts to represent the\nexternal world. This triadic structure suggests that many speech acts,\nincluding non-constatives, involve a set of tacit validity claims: the\nclaim that the speech act is sincere (non-deceptive), is socially\nappropriate or right, and is factually true (or more broadly:\nrepresentationally adequate). Conversely, speech acts can be criticized\nfor failing on one or more of these scores. Thus fully successful\nspeech acts, insofar as they involve these three world relations, must\nsatisfy the demands connected with these three basic validity claims\n(sincerity, rightness, and truth) in order to be acceptable. \n\nWe can think of strong communicative action in the above sense as\ndefining the end of a spectrum of communicative possibilities. At that\nend, social cooperation is both deeply consensual and reasonable:\nactors sincerely agree that their modes of cooperation can be justified\nas good, right, and free of empirical error. Given the difficulties of\nmaintaining such deep consensus, however, it makes sense, particularly\nin complex, pluralistic societies, to relax these communicative demands\nfor specified types of situations, allowing for weaker forms of\ncommunicative action (in which not all three types of validity claims\nare at stake) or strategic action (in which actors understand that\neveryone is oriented toward individual success).  \n\nHabermas distinguishes the “system” as those predefined\nsituations, or modes of coordination, in which the demands of\ncommunicative action are relaxed in this way, within legally specified\nlimits. The prime examples of systemic coordination are markets and\nbureaucracies. In these systemically structured contexts, nonlinguistic\nmedia take up the slack in coordinating actions, which proceeds on the\nbasis of money and institutional power—these media do the\ntalking, as it were, thus relieving actors of the demands of strongly\ncommunicative action. The term “lifeworld,” by contrast,\nrefers to domains of action in which consensual modes of action\ncoordination predominate. In fact, the distinction between lifeworld\nand system is better understood as an analytic one that identifies\ndifferent aspects of social interaction and cooperation (1991b).\n“Lifeworld” then refers to the background resources,\ncontexts, and dimensions of social action that enable actors to\ncooperate on the basis of mutual understanding: shared cultural systems\nof meaning, institutional orders that stabilize patterns of action, and\npersonality structures acquired in family, church, neighborhood, and\nschool (TCA 1: chap. 6; 1998b, chap. 4).  \n\nHabermas's system-lifeworld distinction has been criticized from a\nnumber of perspectives. Some have argued that the distinction\noversimplifies the interpenetrating dynamics of social institutions\n(e.g., McCarthy 1991, 152–80). Others attacked the distinction\nas covertly ideological, concealing forms of patriarchal and economic\ndomination (e.g., Fraser 1985). Habermas's attempt to clarify the\nanalytic character of the distinction only goes partway toward\nanswering these criticisms (1991b). \n\nTCA has also encountered rather heavy weather as a theory of\nmeaning. In the analytic philosophy of language, one of the standard\nrequirements is to account for the compositionality of language, the\nfact that a finite set of words can be used to form an indefinite\nnumber of sentences. From that perspective, Habermas's theory falls\nshort (Heath 2001, chap. 3). But perhaps we would do better to assess\nHabermas's theory of meaning from a different perspective.  The\ncompositionality requirement is important if one wants to explain\ngrammatical competence. But early on Habermas (1976b) expressed a\ngreater interest in explaining communicative, rather than grammatical,\ncompetence: the ability of speakers to use grammatically\nwell-formed sentences in social contexts. Although Habermas often\npresents his pragmatics as a further development in analytic theories\nof meaning, his analysis focuses primarily on the context-sensitive\nacceptability of speech acts: acceptability conditions as a\nfunction of formal features that distinguish different speech\nsituations. This suggests his theory of meaning involves a quite\ndifferent sort of project: to articulate the “validity\nbasis” of social order. \n\nThe significance of this conception of reaching understanding and of\nrationally motivated agreement can also be seen by contrasting this\naccount with other conceptions of understanding and interpretation, such\nas Gadamer's hermeneutics. Given Habermas's conception of\nspeech acts and their relation to validity claims, it is not surprising\nthat he argues that “communicative actions always require\ninterpretations that are rational in approach” (TCA 1:\n106), that is, ones that are made in the performative attitude by an\ninterpreter. In general, Habermas agrees with hermeneutics that the\nwhole domain of the social sciences is accessible only through\ninterpretation, precisely because processes of reaching understanding\nalready at work in the social sciences have antecedently constituted\nthem (ibid., 107). But he draws a distinctive conclusion. Although\nsocial scientists are not actors, they must employ their own\npretheoretical knowledge to gain interpretive access through\ncommunicative experience. As a “virtual participant,” the\nsocial scientist must take a position on the claims made by those he\nobserves: he has access through communicative experience only\n“under the presupposition that he judges the agreement and\ndisagreement, the validity claims and potential reasons with which he\nis confronted” (ibid., 116). There is then no disjunction between\nthe attitude of the critic and the interpreter as reflective\nparticipants. Social scientists may withhold judgments, but only at the\ncost of impoverishing their interpretation and putting out of play\ntheir pretheoretical, practical knowledge that they have in common with\nothers who are able to reach understanding. Thus, various forms of\nrationality become essential to the social sciences, because of the\nnature of the social domain.  \n\nObjecting to Habermas's line of argument, McCarthy and others\nhave argued that it is not a necessary condition that interpreters take\na position in order to understand reasons, even if we have to rely on\nour own competence to judge the validity and soundness of reasons and\nto identify them as reasons at all. Nonetheless, Habermas uses this\nconception in his social theory of modernity to show the ways in which\nmodern culture has unleashed communicative rationality from its\nprevious cultural and ideological constraints. In modern societies,\nsocial norms are no longer presumed to be valid but rather are\nsubjected to critical reflection, as for example when the ethical life\nof a specific culture is criticized from the standpoint of justice. In\na sense consistent with the Enlightenment imperative to use one's\nown reason, the everyday “lifeworld” of social experience\nhas been rationalized, especially in the form of discourses that\ninstitutionalize reflective communicative action, as in scientific and\ndemocratic institutions.  \n\nThe rationalization of the lifeworld in Western modernity went\nhand-in-hand with the growth of systemic mechanisms of coordination\nalready mentioned above, in which the demands on fully communicative\nconsensus are relaxed. If large and complex modern societies can no\nlonger be integrated solely on the basis of shared cultural values and\nnorms, new nonintentional mechanisms of coordination must emerge, which\ntake the form of nonlinguistic media of money and power. For example,\nmarkets coordinate the collective production and distribution of goods\nnonintentionally, even if they are grounded in cultural and political\ninstitutions such as firms and states. Modernization can become\npathological, as when money and power “colonize the\nlifeworld” and displace communicative forms of solidarity and\ninhibit the reproduction of the lifeworld (e.g., when\nuniversities become governed by market strategies).\n“Juridification” is another such pathological form, when\nlaw comes to invade more and more areas of social life, turning\ncitizens into clients of bureaucracies with what Foucault might call\n“normalizing” effects. This aspect of TCA has less\nof an impact on Habermas's current work, which returns to the\ntheme of improving democratic practice as a means of counteracting\njuridification and colonization. Democratic institutions, if properly\ndesigned and robustly executed, are supposed to ensure that the law\ndoes not take this pathological form but is subject to the deliberation\nof citizens, who thus author the laws to which they are subject (see\nsec. 3.4).  \n\nAfter TCA, then, Habermas begins to see law not as part of\nthe problem, but as part of the solution, once he offers a more\ncomplete discourse-theoretical account of law and democracy.\nNonetheless the theory of modernity still remains in his continued use\nof systems theory and its understanding of nonintentional integration.\nBy insisting upon popular sovereignty as the outcome of the generation\nof “communicative power” in the public sphere, Habermas\ntries to save the substance of radical democracy. The unresolved\ndifficulty is that in a complex society, as Habermas asserts,\n“public opinion does not rule” but rather points\nadministrative power in particular directions; or, as he puts it, it\ndoes not “steer” but “countersteers”\ninstitutional complexity (1996b, chapter 8). That is, citizens do not\ncontrol social processes; they exercise influence through particular\ninstitutionalized mechanisms and channels of communication. However\nsuccessful democracy is in creating legitimacy, it cannot gain full\ncontrol over large-scale complex societies, nor even of the necessary\nconditions for its own realization. In this sense, Habermas's\nemphasis on the limiting effect of complexity on democracy and his\nrejection of a fully democratic form of sociation continue the basic\nargument of the necessity of systems integration, even with its costs.\nRadical democracy may no longer be the only means to social\ntransformation, though it is clear that it remains “the\nunfinished project of modernity”: realizing and transforming\ndemocracy is still a genuine goal even for complex and globalizing\nsocieties.  \n\nHabermas's theory of communicative action rests on the idea\nthat social order ultimately depends on the capacity of actors to\nrecognize the intersubjective validity of the different claims on which\nsocial cooperation depends. In conceiving cooperation in relation to\nvalidity claims, Habermas highlights its rational and cognitive\ncharacter: to recognize the validity of such claims is to presume that\ngood reasons could be given to justify them in the face of criticism.\nTCA thus points to and depends on an account of such\njustification—that is, on a theory of argumentation or discourse,\nwhich Habermas calls the “reflective form” of communicative\naction.  \n\nAs mentioned above, Habermas proposes a multi-dimensional conception\nof reason that expresses itself in different forms of cognitive\nvalidity: not only in truth claims about the empirical world, but also\nin rightness claims about the kind of treatment we owe each other as\npersons, authenticity claims about the good life, technical-pragmatic\nclaims about the means suitable to different goals, and so on. As he\nacknowledges, the surface grammar of speech acts does not suffice to\nestablish this range of validity types. Rather, to ground the\nmulti-dimensional system of validity claims, one must supplement\nsemantic analysis with a pragmatic analysis of the different sorts of\nargumentative discourse—the different “logics of\nargumentation”—through which each type can be\nintersubjectively justified (TCA 1: 8–42). Thus, a type of\nvalidity claim counts as distinct from other types only if one can\nestablish that its discursive justification involves features that\ndistinguish it from other types of justification. Whether or not his\npragmatic theory of meaning succeeds, the discursive analysis of\nvalidity illuminates important differences in the argumentative demands\nthat come with different types of justifiable claims. To see how\nHabermas identifies these different features, it is first necessary to\nunderstand the general structures of argumentation. \n\nThe pragmatic analysis of argumentation in general.\nHabermas's discourse theory assumes that the specific type of\nvalidity claim one aims to justify—the cognitive goal or topic of\nargumentation—determines the specific argumentative practices\nappropriate for such justification. Discourse theory thus calls for a\npragmatic analysis of argumentation as a social practice. Such analysis\naims to reconstruct the normative presuppositions that structure the\ndiscourse of competent arguers. To get at these presuppositions, one\ncannot simply describe argumentation as it empirically occurs; as we\nalready saw in TCA, one must adopt the performative attitude\nof a participant and articulate the shared, though often tacit, ideals\nand rules that provide the basis for regarding some arguments as better\nthan others. Following contemporary argumentation theorists, Habermas\nassumes one cannot fully articulate these normative presuppositions\nsolely in terms of the logical properties of arguments. Rather, he\ndistinguishes three aspects of argument-making practices: argument as\nproduct, as procedure, and as process, which he loosely aligns with the\ntraditional perspectives on argument evaluation of logic, dialectic,\nand rhetoric. Pragmatically, each of these perspectives functions as a\n“level of presupposition” involved in the assessment of the\ncogency—the goodness or strength—of arguments. Habermas\nseems to regard these perspectives, taken together, as constituting the\npragmatic idea of cogency: “at no single one of these analytic\nlevels can the very idea intrinsic to argumentative speech be\nadequately developed” (TCA 1: 26). \n\nAt the logical level, participants are concerned with\narguments as products, that is, sets of reasons that support\nconclusions. From this perspective, arguers aim to construct\n“cogent arguments that are convincing in virtue of their\nintrinsic properties and with which validity claims can be redeemed or\nrejected” (ibid., 25). Following work by Stephen Toulmin and\nother informal logicians, Habermas regards most if not all\nargumentation as ultimately resting on ampliative arguments whose\nconclusions do not follow with deductive certainty but only as more or\nless plausible or probable. The logical strength of such arguments\ndepends on how well one has taken into account all the relevant\ninformation and possible objections. Thus the term\n“logical” has a broad sense that includes not only formal\nbut also informal logics, in which strength depends on the interrelated\nmeanings of terms and background information that resists complete\nformalization: induction, analogy, narrative, and so on. \n\nGiven the ampliative character of most arguments, logical assessment\npresupposes the dialectical adequacy of argumentative procedures. That\nis, we may regard the products of our argument-making practices as\nlogically strong only if we presume, at the dialectical level, that we\nhave submitted arguments and counterarguments to sufficiently severe\nprocedures of critical discussion—as Habermas (TCA 1:\n26) puts it, a “ritualized competition for the better\narguments.” Dialectical treatments of argumentation typically\nspell out the “dialectical obligations” of discussants:\nthat one should address the issue at hand, should respond to relevant\nchallenges, meet the specified burden of proof, and so on. \n\nHowever, robust critical testing of competing arguments depends in\nturn on the rhetorical quality of the persuasive process. Habermas\nconceives the rhetorical level in terms of highly idealized properties\nof communication, which he initially presented as the conditions of an\n“ideal speech situation” (1973a; also 1971/2001). That way\nof speaking now strikes him as overly reified, suggesting an ideal\ncondition that real discourses must measure up to, or at least\napproximately satisfy—motifs that Habermas himself employed\nuntil rather recently (cf. 1993, 54–55; 1996b, 322–23). He\nnow understands the idea of rhetorically adequate process as a set of\nunavoidable yet counterfactual “pragmatic presuppositions”\nthat participants must make if they are to regard the actual execution\nof dialectical procedures as a sufficiently severe critical\ntest. Habermas (2005b, 89) identifies four such presuppositions as the\nmost important: (i) no one capable of making a relevant contribution\nhas been excluded, (ii) participants have equal voice, (iii) they are\ninternally free to speak their honest opinion without deception or\nself-deception, and (iv) there are no sources of coercion built into\nthe process and procedures of discourse. Such conditions, in effect,\narticulate what it would mean to assess all the relevant information\nand arguments (for a given level of knowledge and inquiry) as\nreasonably as possible, weighing arguments purely on the merits in a\ndisinterested pursuit of truth. These conditions are counterfactual in\nthe sense that actual discourses can rarely realize—and can\nnever empirically certify—full inclusion, non-coercion, and\nequality. At the same time, these idealizing presuppositions have an\noperative effect on actual discourse: we may regard outcomes (both\nconsensual and non-consensual) as reasonable only if our scrutiny of\nthe process does not uncover obvious exclusions, suppression of\narguments, manipulation, self-deception, and the like (2003a, 108). In\nthis sense, these pragmatic idealizations function as\n“standards for a self-correcting learning\nprocess” (2005b, 91). \n\nAs an understanding of the rhetorical perspective, Habermas's\nhighly idealized and formal model hardly does justice to the\nsubstantive richness of the rhetorical tradition. One can, however,\nsupplement his model with a more substantive rhetoric that draws on\nAristotle's account of ethos and pathos (Rehg 1997). In that\ncase, the rhetorical perspective is concerned with designing arguments\nfor their ability to place the particular audience in the proper\nsocial-psychological space for making a responsible collective\njudgment. Yet the “space of responsible judgment” still\nremains an idealization that may not be reduced to any observable\nactual behavior, but can at most be defeasibly presumed. The same\nprobably holds for dialectical procedures. Although the dialectical\nperspective draws on the tradition of public debate, dialectical\nnorms, when understood as pragmatic presuppositions, are not identical\nwith institutionalized rules of debate (1990a, 91). A neutral observer\ncan judge whether interlocutors have externally complied with\ninstitutional procedures, whereas engaged participants must judge how\nwell they have satisfied the dialectical presupposition of severe\ncritical testing. \n\nThe differentiation of argumentative discourses. If the\ndifferent validity claims require different types of argumentation,\nthen the relevant differences must emerge through a closer analysis of\nthe ways the above aspects of argumentative practice adjust to\ndifferent sorts of content, that is, the different validity claims at\nissue (cf. 2008, chap. 3). To be sure, Habermas does not regard every\nvalidity claim as open to discourse proper. Sincerity claims (or\n“truthfulness claims,” as it is sometimes translated) are\nthe prime example. These are claims an actor makes about his or her\ninterior subjectivity: feelings, moods, desires, beliefs, and the like.\nSuch claims are open to rational assessment, not in discourse but by\ncomparison with the actor's behavior: for example, if a son\nclaims to care deeply about his parents but never pays them any\nattention, we would have grounds for doubting the sincerity of his\nclaim. Note that such insincerity might involve self-deception rather\nthan deliberate lying. \n\nTruth and rightness claims, by contrast, are susceptible to\nargumentative justification in the proper sense, through what Habermas\ncalls “strict discourses.” As he first analyzed the\ndiscourses connected with these two types of validity (1973a), they had\nmuch in common. Although the types of reasons differed—moral\ndiscourse rested primarily on need interpretations,\nempirical-theoretical discourse on empirical inductions—in both\ncases, the relevant reasons should, in principle, be acceptable to any\nreasonable agent. In the case of empirical truth claims, this\nprocess-level presupposition of consensus rests on the idea that the\nobjective world is the same for all; in the case of moral rightness, it\nrests on the idea that valid moral rules and principles hold for all\npersons. In both cases, the appropriate audience for the testing of\nclaims is universal, and in making a truth or rightness claim one\ncounterfactually presupposes that a universal consensus would result,\nwere the participants able to pursue a sufficiently inclusive and\nreasonable discourse for a sufficient length of time. Although his\nearly statements are somewhat unclear, on one reading Habermas defined\nnot only moral rightness but also empirical truth in terms of such\nideal consensus (similar to C. S. Peirce). He now further distinguishes\ntruth from moral rightness by defining the latter, but not the former,\nin terms of idealized consensus. More on that below. \n\nAuthenticity claims, unlike truth and rightness claims, do not come\nwith such a strong consensual expectation. Habermas associates this\ntype of claim with “ethical” discourse. Unlike moral\ndiscourse, in which participants strive to justify norms and courses of\naction that accord due concern and respect for persons in general,\nethical discourses focus on questions of the good life, either for a\ngiven individual (“ethical-existential” discourse) or for a\nparticular group or polity (“ethical-political” discourse).\nConsequently, the kind of reasons that constitute cogent arguments in\nethical discourse depend on the life histories, traditions, and\nparticular values of those whose good is at issue. This reference to\nindividual- and group-related particularities means that one should not\nexpect those reasons to win universal consensus (1993, 1–18; 1996b,\n162–68). However, Habermas (2003b) seems to recognize one class of\nethical questions that do admit of universal consensus. Choices of\ntechnologies that bear on the future of human nature, such as genetic\nenhancement engineering, pose species-wide ethical issues. Such issues\nconcern not merely our self-understanding as members of this or that\nparticular culture or tradition, but how we should understand our basic\nhuman dignity. In his view, the core of human dignity, and thus the basis for a\nhuman-species ethics, lies in the capacity of human beings\nfor autonomous self-determination. \n\nIn sum, Habermas's discourse theory aligns different types of\nvalidity claim with different types of justificatory discourse. At the\nlogical level, cogent arguments must employ somewhat different sorts of\nreasons to justify different types of claims. Although some sorts of\nreasons might enter into each type of discourse (e.g., empirical\nclaims), the set of relevant considerations that are individually\nnecessary and jointly sufficient for making logically strong arguments\nwill differ. Thus, claims about what human beings need are relevant\nreasons in moral arguments about welfare obligations, but not for\nsupporting the truth claim that quarks exist. At the dialectical level,\none must meet different burdens of proof by answering different types\nof challenges. For example, in defending the ethical authenticity of\nTom's pursuit of a career in medicine, one need not show that\nmedicine is a career everyone must follow, but only that such a career\nmakes sense, given Tom's personal background, talents, and\ndesires. One can also examine Tom's career choice from a moral\nperspective, but in that case one need only show that anyone in his\ncircumstances is morally permitted to pursue medicine. At the\nrhetorical level, finally, the scope and depth of agreement differs\naccording to the type of claim. Moral rightness claims and empirical\ntruth claims are justified by reasons that should be acceptable to a\nuniversal audience, whereas ethical claims are addressed to those who\nshare a particular history and tradition of values.  \n\nHaving differentiated types of discourse, Habermas must say something\nabout how they interrelate. Clearly, some discourses depend on other\ntypes: most obviously, moral and ethical discourses partly depend on\nempirical claims, and thus depend on the outcome of empirical\ndiscourses about the circumstances and consequences of behavioral rules\nand the collective pursuit of the good life. The question of\ninterrelationship becomes especially urgent in the political sphere,\nwhere different discourses intertwine and lead to competing\nconclusions, or when issues arise in which discourse types cannot be\ncleanly separated, so that the standards of cogency become obscure or\ndeeply contested (McCarthy 1991, chap. 7; 1998). Because Habermas\n(1996c, 1534f) rejects the idea of a metadiscourse that sorts out these\nboundary issues, he must answer this challenge in his democratic\ntheory. Before taking up that topic, Habermas's theory of truth\ndeserves a closer look. \n\nIn his various essays on empirical truth, Habermas usually regards\npropositions as the truth-bearer: in making an assertion, “I am\nclaiming that the proposition [Aussage] that I am asserting is\ntrue” (1971/2001, 86; cf. 2003a, 249ff). In his early treatment,\nhowever, he immediately equated empirical truth with ideal\njustifiability—the consensus theory of truth mentioned above.\nAccording to that theory, the “truth condition of propositions is\nthe potential assent of all others”; thus “the\nuniversal-pragmatic meaning of truth…is determined by the demand\nof reaching a rational consensus” (1971/2001, 89; cf. 86). Such\nformulations suggest that Habermas equated the meaning of truth with\nthe outcome of a universal, rational consensus, which he understood in\nreference to the ideal speech situation (ibid., 97–98). However, he\nsoon saw the difficulties with consensus theory, and he never allowed\n“Wahrheitstheorien” (1973a), his main essay on the\nconsensus theory of truth, to appear in English. Like the\n“epistemic” theories of truth that link truth with ideal\nwarranted assertibility (e.g., Hilary Putnam, Crispin Wright),\nconsensus theory downplays the justification-transcendent character of\ntruth (2003a, 250–52).  \n\nHabermas now proposes instead a “pragmatic epistemological\nrealism” (2003a, 7; 1998b, chap. 8). His theory of truth is\nrealist in holding that the objective world, rather than ideal\nconsensus, is the truth-maker. If a proposition (or sentence,\nstatement) for which we claim truth is indeed true, it is so because it\naccurately refers to existing objects, or accurately represents actual\nstates of affairs—albeit objects and states of affairs about\nwhich we can state facts only under descriptions that depend on our\nlinguistic resources. The inescapability of language dictates the\npragmatic epistemological character of his realism. Specifically,\nHabermas eschews the attempt to explicate the relationship between\nproposition and world metaphysically (e.g., as in correspondence\ntheories). Rather, he explicates the meaning of accurate representation\npragmatically, in terms of its implications for everyday practice and\ndiscourse. Insofar as we take propositional contents as\nunproblematically true in our daily practical engagement with reality,\nwe act confidently on the basis of well-corroborated beliefs about\nobjects in the world. What Habermas (1971/2001, 94; TCA 1: 23)\ncalls “theoretico-empirical” or “theoretical”\ndiscourse becomes necessary when beliefs lose their unproblematic\nstatus as the result of practical difficulties, or when novel\ncircumstances pose questions about the natural world. Such cases call\nfor an empirical inquiry in which truth claims about the world are\nsubmitted to critical testing. Although Habermas tends to sharply\nseparate action and discourse, it seems more plausible to regard such\ncritical testing as combining discourse with experimental\nactions—as we see in scientific inquiry, which combines empirical\narguments with practical actions, that is, field studies and\nlaboratory experimentation.  \n\nTo date Habermas has not drawn out the implications of his discourse\ntheory for a detailed account of truth-oriented discourses, which we\nfind most highly developed in the sciences (but see Rehg 2009,\nchaps. 4–6). As an argumentation theory, such an account would\nprobably have to take the following broad lines: at the logical level,\nthe discursive justification of problematic truth claims heavily\nrelies on empirical reasons: observation reports, results of\nexperimental tests, and the like. Similarly for the dialectical level:\nthe chief challenges arise from theories and observations that\nseemingly conflict with the claim at issue or with its supporting\nreasons. At the rhetorical level, one seeks the agreement of a\npotentially universal audience, given that truth claims are about an\nobjective world that is the same for all human beings.  This sketch,\nhowever, leaves out precisely the details that would make a discourse\ntheory of science interesting. For example, how do epistemic and\naesthetic values (scope, accuracy, simplicity, etc.)  affect the\nlogical construction of scientific arguments? Must not the\npresupposition of a universal audience be attenuated, given that\nscientists investigate aspects of the world (e.g., subatomic\nparticles) that are inaccessible to all but a small group of trained\nexperts? How does the cogency of scientific arguments depend on or\ninvolve various institutional structures and mechanisms, such as peer\nreview, assignment of credit, distribution of grant money, and so\non?  \n\nHabermas's two enduring interests in political theory and\nrationality come together in his discourse theory of deliberative\ndemocracy. There we see him struggling to show how his highly\nidealized, multi-dimensional discourse theory has real institutional\npurchase in complex, modern societies. In that context, argumentation\nappears in the form of public discussion and debate over practical\nquestions that confront political bodies. The challenge, then, is to\nshow how an idealized model of practical discourse connects with real\ninstitutional contexts of decision-making.  \n\nHabermas summarizes his idealized conception of practical discourse\nin the “discourse principle” (D), which we might state as\nfollows: A rule of action or choice is justified, and thus valid, only\nif all those affected by the rule or choice could accept it in a\nreasonable discourse. Although he first understood (D) as a principle\nof moral discourse, he now positions it as an overarching principle of\nimpartial justification that holds for all types of practical discourse\n(cf. 1990a, 66, 93; 1996b, 107). As such, it simply summarizes his\nargumentation theory for any question involving the various\n“employments of practical reason” (1993, chap. 1). (D) thus\napplies not only to moral rightness and ethical authenticity, but also\nto the justification of technical-pragmatic claims about the choice of\neffective means for achieving a given end. Each type of practical\ndiscourse then involves a further specification of (D) for the content\nat issue. In developing his democratic theory, Habermas has been\nespecially concerned with two such specifications: moral discourse and\nlegal-political discourse. In distinguishing these two types of\ndiscourse, Habermas tackles the traditional problem of the relationship\nbetween law and morality. He also shows how to bring ethereal\ndiscursive idealizations down to institutional earth. We start with his\naccount of moral discourse. \n\nHabermas's discourse ethics. Habermas's\ndiscourse theory of morality generally goes by the name\n“discourse ethics,” a somewhat misleading label given that\n“ethics” has a distinct non-moral sense for him, as noted\nabove. The idea of a discourse ethics was anticipated by G. H. Mead\n(1962, 379–89) and has been pursued by a number of philosophers (e.g., see\nApel 1990, Benhabib 1992; Wingert 1993; Forst 2012). Habermas's version is heavily\nindebted to the Kantian tradition. Like Kant, he considers morality a\nmatter of unconditional moral obligations: the prohibitions, positive\nobligations, and permissions that regulate interaction among persons.\nThe task of moral theory is to reconstruct the unconditional force of\nsuch obligations as impartial dictates of practical reason that hold\nfor any similarly situated agent. Also like Kant, Habermas links\nmorality with respect for autonomous agency: in following the dictates\nof impartial reason, one follows one's own conscience and shows\nrespect for other such agents. Unlike Kant, however, Habermas takes a\ndialogical approach to practical reason, as his discourse theory\nrequires. Kant assumed that in principle each mature, reflective\nindividual, guided by the Categorical Imperative, could reach the same\nconclusions about what duty requires. This assumption has long been\nrecognized as problematic, but in pluralistic and multicultural\nsettings it becomes entirely untenable: one may plausibly claim to take\nan impartial moral point of view only by engaging in real discourse\nwith all those affected by the issue in question.  \n\nHabermas's (D)-Principle articulates this dialogical\nrequirement. If one assumes this requirement, then one can arrive at\nHabermas's specific conception of reasonable moral discourse by\nworking out the implications of his argumentation theory for the\ndiscursive testing of unconditional moral obligations. What one gets\nis a dialogical principle of universalization\n(U): “A [moral norm] is valid just in case the foreseeable\nconsequences and side-effects of its general observance for the\ninterests and value-orientations of each individual could be\njointly accepted by all concerned without\ncoercion” (i.e., in a sufficiently reasonable discourse) (1998a,\n42; trans. amended). Habermas maintains that (U) can be deduced from\nstatements articulating the pragmatic implications of argumentative\ndiscourse over moral norms (1990a, 86–93; 1998a,\n39–45). More precisely, a successful deduction probably depends\non three assumptions: (D), a statement of the semantics of\nunconditional norms, and an articulation of the pragmatics of\ndiscourse (Rehg 2011; cf. Ott 2004). If we accept (D) and if we accept\nHabermas's explication of the rhetorical presuppositions of the\ndiscursive justification required by (D), then (U) would have to\nfollow as an implication of what is required for discursively\njustifying norms with the specific content of moral norms, namely\nobligations that bind persons in general and whose acceptance thus\naffects each person's pursuit of interests and the good life. From the\nstandpoint of argumentation theory, (U) seems to state the burden of\nproof that structures an adequate process and procedure of\njustification. \n\nThe (U)-Principle assumes that valid moral rules or norms allow for an\negalitarian community of autonomous agents—as Kant put it, a\n“systematic union of different rational beings” governed\nby “common laws” (1785, Ak. 433; also 431). However, the\n(U)-Principle has been a site of controversy among discourse\ntheorists, and not everyone considers it necessary for a discourse\nethics (Benhabib and Dallmayr 1990; Wellmer 1991; Gottschalk-Mazouz\n2000). Some feminist proponents of an \"ethics of care\" have worried\nthat Habermas's neo-Kantian model of universalization screens out\nmorally relevant particularities of concrete situations and persons\n(Young 1990; Benhabib 1992, chap. 5). \n\nWhether or not the argument for (U) goes through, Habermas's\ndiscourse ethics depends on some very strong assumptions about the\ncapacity of persons for moral dialogue. Given that his discourse theory\nin general, and thus (U) in particular, rests on counterfactual\nidealizations, one might be tempted to regard (U) as a hypothetical\nthought experiment, analogous to what we find in other neo-Kantian or\ncontractualist theories like those of John Rawls and T. M. Scanlon. To\nsome extent this is correct: to regard a moral norm as valid, one must\npresume it would hold up in a fully inclusive and reasonable discourse.\nBut Habermas takes a further step, insisting that (U) is a principle of\nreal discourse: an individual's moral judgment counts as fully\nreasonable only if it issues from participation in actual discourse\nwith all those affected. Moreover, (U) requires not simply that one\nseek the input of others in forming one's conscience, but that\none gain their reasonable agreement.  \n\nTo bring such strong idealizations down to earth, one must connect\nthem with conscientious judgment in everyday moral practice. One way\nto do this is through an account of the appropriate application of\nmoral rules in concrete circumstances. In response to ethics-of-care\nobjections (and following Günther 1993), Habermas has\nacknowledged the need for such an account (1993, 35–39). In\nmoral discourses of application, one must test alternative normative\ninterpretations of the particular situation for their acceptability\nbefore the limited audience of those immediately involved, on the\nassumption that one is applying valid general norms. But even at the\nlevel of application, discourse cannot always include all the affected\nparties (e.g., when the issue concerns the fate of a comatose\npatient).  Habermas's discourse ethics thus implies that for many, if\nnot most, of our moral rules and choices, the best we can achieve are\npartial justifications: arguments that are not conclusively convincing\nfor all, but also are not conclusively defeated, in limited\ndiscourses with interlocutors we regard as reasonable (cf. Rehg 2003,\n2004).  \n\nHabermas has also attempted to give discourse ethics some empirical\nfoothold by looking to moral psychology and social anthropology\n(1990a, 116–94). The psychological line of argument draws on the\ntheory of communicative action to reconstruct theories of moral\ndevelopment such as Lawrence Kohlberg's. According to Habermas, moral\nmaturation involves the growing ability to integrate the interpersonal\nperspectives given with the system of personal pronouns; the endpoint\nof that process coincides with the capacity to engage in the mutual\nperspective-taking required by (U). The anthropological line of\nargument focuses on identity formation, drawing on the social\npsychology of G. H. Mead. In broad agreement with Hegelian models of\nmutual recognition, Mead understands the individual's development of a\nstable personal identity as inextricably bound up with processes of\nsocialization that depend on participation in relationships of mutual\nrecognition. Habermas extends this analysis to respond to feminist and\ncommunitarian criticisms of impartialist, justice-based moralities\n(ibid., 195–215; 1990b). Such moralities, critics allege, assume\nan implausibly atomistic view of the self. Thus they fail to\nappreciate the moral import of particularity and cultural substance:\nparticular relationships between unique individuals, on the one hand,\nand membership in particular cultural communities or traditions, on\nthe other (for feminist critiques, see Benhabib 1992; Meehan 1995; for\na communitarian argument, see Taylor 1989). Mead's analysis shows that\nthe critics are on to an important point: if individuation depends on\nsocialization, then any anthropologically viable system of morality\nmust protect not only the integrity of individuals but also the web of\nrelationships and cultural forms of life on which individuals depend\nfor their moral development. Discourse ethics, Habermas claims, meets\nthis two-fold demand in virtue of the kind of mutual\nperspective-taking it requires. If we examine (U), we see that it\nrequires participants to attend to the values and interests of each\nperson as a unique individual; conversely, each individual conditions\nher judgment about the moral import of her values and interests on\nwhat all participants can freely accept. Consequently, moral discourse\nis structured in a way that links moral validity with solidaristic\nconcern for both the concrete individual and the morally formative\ncommunities on which her identity depends. \n\nThese arguments are certainly ambitious, and they raise as many\nquestions as they answer. It is hardly surprising, then, that many\ncommentators have not been persuaded by discourse ethics as a\nnormative ethics. Rather, they regard it as plausible only in the\ncontext of democratic politics, or as a model for the critical\nevaluation of formal dialogues (e.g., environmental conflict\nresolution, medical ethics committees, and the like). Other critics\nhave targeted discourse ethics at a metaethical level. In fact,\nHabermas first unveiled his moral theory in answer to moral\nnon-cognitivism and skepticism (1990a, 43–115). In this context,\n(U) explicates a moral epistemology: what it means for moral\nstatements to count as justified. If moral statements are justifiable,\nthen they have a cognitive character in the sense that they are\ncorrect or not depending on how they fare in reasonable\ndiscourse. However, Habermas proposes (U) not merely as articulating a\nconsensus model of moral justification, but as an explication of the\nmeaning of rightness itself. Unlike truth, the rightness of a moral\nnorm does not consist in reference to an independently existing realm\nof objects, but rather in the worthiness of the norm for\nintersubjective recognition. Thus rightness, unlike truth, means ideal\nwarranted assertibility (2005b, 93; 2003a, chap. 6). This antirealist\ninterpretation of discourse ethics has been challenged, however, with\nsome critics advocating a realist interpretation of rightness, others\na deflationary approach (Lafont 1999, chap. 7; Heath 1998).   \n\nHabermas's discourse theory of law and politics. The\ncentral task of Habermas's democratic theory is to provide a\nnormative account of legitimate law. His deliberative democratic model\nrests on what is perhaps the most complex argument in his philosophical\ncorpus, found in his Between Facts and Norms (1996b; German\ned., 1992b; for commentary, see Baynes 1995; Rosenfeld and Arato 1998;\nvom Schomberg and Baynes 2004). Boiled down to its essentials, however,\nthe argument links his discourse theory with an analysis of the demands\ninherent in modern legal systems, which Habermas understands in light\nof the history of Western modernization. The analysis thus begins with\na functional explanation of the need for positive law in modern\nsocieties. This analysis picks up on points he made in TCA\n(see sec. 3.1 above). \n\nSocieties are stable over the long run only if their members\ngenerally perceive them as legitimate: as organized in accordance with\nwhat is true, right, and good. In premodern Europe, legitimacy was\ngrounded in a shared religious worldview that penetrated all spheres of\nlife. As modernization engendered religious pluralism and functional\ndifferentiation (autonomous market economies, bureaucratic\nadministrations, unconstrained scientific research), the potentials for\nmisunderstanding and conflict about the good and the right\nincreased—just as the shared background resources for the\nconsensual resolution of such conflicts decreased. When we consider\nthis dynamic simply from the standpoint of the (D)-principle, the\nprospects for legitimacy in modern societies appear quite dim.  \n\nSociologically, then, one can understand modern law as a functional\nsolution to the conflict potentials inherent in modernization. By\nopening up legally defined spheres of individual freedom, modern law\nreduces the burden of questions that require general (society-wide)\ndiscursive consensus. Within these legal boundaries, individuals are\nfree to pursue their interests and happiness as they see fit, normally\nthrough various modes of association, whether that pursuit is primarily\ngoverned by modes of strategic action (as in economic markets), by\nrecognized authority or consensual discourse (e.g., within religious\ncommunities; in the sciences), or by bureaucratic rationality (as in\nhierarchically organized voluntary enterprises). Consequently, modern\nlaw is fundamentally concerned with the definition, protection, and\nreconciliation of individual freedoms in their various\ninstitutional and organizational contexts.  \n\nThe demands on the legitimation of law change with this functional\nrealignment: to be legitimate, modern law must secure the\nprivate autonomy of those subject to it. The legal\nguarantee of private autonomy in turn presupposes an established legal\ncode and a legally defined status of equal citizenship in terms of\nactionable basic rights that secure a space for individual freedom.\nHowever, such rights are expressions of freedom only if citizens can\nalso understand themselves as the authors of the laws that interpret\ntheir rights—that is, only if the laws that protect private\nautonomy also issue from citizens' exercise of public\nautonomy as lawmakers acting through elected representatives. Thus,\nthe rights that define individual freedom must also include rights of\npolitical participation. As Habermas understands the relation between\nprivate and public autonomy, each is “co-original” or\n“equiprimordial,” conceptually presupposing the other in\nthe sense that each can be fully realized only if the other is fully\nrealized. The exercise of public autonomy in its full sense\npresupposes participants who understand themselves as individually\nfree (privately autonomous), which in turn presupposes that they can\nshape their individual freedoms through the exercise of public\nautonomy. This equiprimordial relationship, Habermas\nbelieves, enables his discourse theory to combine the best insights of\nthe civic republican and classical liberal traditions of democracy,\nwhich found expression in Rousseau and Locke, respectively (1998a, chap. 9). \n\nHabermas (1996b, chap. 3) understands these rights of liberty and\npolitical participation as an abstract system of basic rights generated\nby reflection on the nature of discursive legitimation (articulated in\nthe D-Principle) in contexts shaped by the functional demands on modern\nlaw (or the “form” of positive law). Because these rights\nare abstract, each polity must further interpret and flesh them out for\nits particular historical circumstances, perhaps supplementing them\nwith further welfare and environmental rights. In any case, the system\nof rights constitutes a minimum set of normative institutional\nconditions for any legitimate modern political order. The system of\nrights, in other words, articulates the normative framework for\nconstitutional democracies, within which further institutional\nmechanisms such as legislatures and other branches of government must\noperate. \n\nThe idea of public autonomy means that the legitimacy of ordinary\nlegislation must ultimately be traceable to robust processes of public\ndiscourse that influence formal decisionmaking in legislative bodies.\nHabermas summarizes this requirement in his democratic principle of\nlegitimacy: “only those statutes may claim legitimacy that can\nmeet with the assent of all citizens in a discursive process of\nlegislation that in turn has been legally constituted” (1996b,\n110). As he goes on to explain, this principle articulates the core\nrequirement for “externally” institutionalizing the\ndifferent types of practical discourse that are relevant for the\njustification of particular laws. Decisions about laws typically\ninvolve a combination of validity claims: not only truth claims about\nthe likely consequences of different legal options, but also claims\nabout their moral rightness (or justice), claims about the authenticity\nof different options in light of the polity's shared values and\nhistory, and pragmatic claims about which option is feasible or more\nefficient. Legitimate laws must pass the different types of discursive\ntests that come with each of these validity claims. Habermas also\nrecognizes that many issues involve conflicts among particular\ninterests that cannot be reconciled by discursive agreement on validity\nbut only through fair bargaining processes.  \n\nThis strong orientation toward cognitive validity qualifies Habermas's\nversion of deliberative democracy as an “epistemic”\ntheory. This puts his democratic principle in a rather puzzling\nposition. On the one hand, it represents a specification of the\ndiscourse principle for a particular kind of discourse\n(legal-political discourse). This makes it analogous to the moral\nprinciple (U), which specifies (D) for moral discourse. As a specific\nprinciple of reasonable discourse, the democratic principle seems to\nhave the character of an idealizing presupposition insofar as it\npresumes the possibility of consensual decisionmaking in politics.\nFor Habermas, reasonable political discourse must at least begin with\nthe supposition that legal questions admit in principle of single\nright answers (1996c, 1491–95), or at least a set of\ndiscursively valid answers on which a fair compromise, acceptable to\nall parties, is possible. This highly cognitive, consensualist\npresumption has drawn fire even from sympathetic commentators. One\ndifficulty lies in Habermas's assumption that in public discourse over\ncontroversial political issues, citizens can separate the moral\nconstraints on acceptable solutions, presumably open to general\nconsensus, from ethical-political and pragmatic considerations, over\nwhich reasonable citizens may reasonably disagree. As various critics\nhave pointed out, this distinction is very hard to maintain in\npractice, and perhaps in theory as well (Bohman 1996; McCarthy 1998;\nWarnke 1999).\n \n\nOn the other hand, the democratic principle lies at a different level\nfrom principles like (U), as Habermas himself emphasizes (1996b,\n110). The latter specify (D) for this or that single type of practical\ndiscourse, in view of internal cognitive demands on justification,\nwhereas the former pulls together all the forms of practical discourse\nand sets forth conditions on their\nexternal institutionalization. From this perspective, the\ndemocratic principle acts as a bridge that links the cognitive aspects\nof political discourse (as a combination of the different types of\nidealized discourse) with the demands of institutional realization in\ncomplex societies. As such, the democratic principle should refer not\nto consensus, but rather to something like a warranted presumption of\nreasonableness. In fact, in a number of places Habermas describes\ndemocratic legitimacy in just such terms, which we might paraphrase as\nfollows: citizens may regard their laws as legitimate insofar as the\ndemocratic process, as it is institutionally organized and conducted,\nwarrants the presumption that outcomes are reasonable products of a\nsufficiently inclusive deliberative process of opinion- and\nwill-formation (2008, 103). The presumption of reasonable outcomes\nthus rests not so much on the individual capacities of citizens to act\nlike the participants of ideal discourse, but rather on the aggregate\nreasonableness of a “subjectless communication” that\nemerges as the collective result of discursive structures—the\nformal and informal modes of organizing discussion (1996b,\n184–86, 301, 341). This means that democracy is\n“decentered,” no longer fully under control of its own\nconditions and no longer based on a congruent subject of\nself-legislating discourse. \n\nHabermas dubs his position an “epistemic proceduralism.”\nThe position is proceduralist because collective reasonableness\nemerges from the operation of the democratic process; it is epistemic\ninsofar as that process results in collective learning. The latter\npresupposes a fruitful interplay of three major discursive arenas: the\ndispersed communication of citizens in civil society; the\n“media-based mass communication” in the political public\nsphere; and the institutionalized discourse of lawmakers. When these\narenas work well together, civil society and the public sphere\ngenerate a set of considered public opinions that then influence the\ndeliberation of lawmakers (2009). In light of the above ambiguity in\nthe status of (D), however, one might want to take a more pragmatic\napproach to democratic deliberation. Such an approach (e.g., Bohman\n1996; McCarthy 1998) understands deliberation as less a matter of\nsettling disputes over the cognitive validity of competing proposals\nthan a matter of developing legal frameworks within which citizens can\ncontinue to cooperate despite disagreements about what is right or\ngood.  \n\nHabermas's discourse theory also has implications for\ninternational modes of deliberation—hence for the debate about a\npotential cosmopolitan political order. To understand his position in\nthis debate, it helps to sketch a typology of the main theories. The\ncurrent discussion moves along four main axes: political or social,\ninstitutional or noninstitutional, democratic or nondemocratic, and\ntransnational or cosmopolitan. Theories are informed by background\nassumptions about the scope of cosmopolitanism: whether it is moral to\nthe extent that it is concerned with individuals and their life\nopportunities, social to the extent that it makes associations and\ninstitutions central, or political to the extent that it focuses on\nspecifically legal and political institutions, including citizenship.\nHabermas's position in this debate is moderate. It is not minimal\nin the sense of Rawls's law of peoples, which denies the need for\nany strong international legal or political order, much less a\ndemocratic one. Nor is it a strongly democratic position, such as David\nHeld's version of cosmopolitan order. However, both Held and\nHabermas share a common emphasis on the emergence of international\npublic law as central to a just global political order. \n\nIn his essay “Kant's Idea of Perpetual Peace: At Two\nHundred Years' Historical Remove” (1998a, chap. 7; German\ned., 1996a, chap. 7), Habermas was optimistic about the prospects for a\nglobal political order as the continuation of the form of democracy\nbased on human rights typical of nation states. Democracy on the\nnation-state model connects three central ideas: that the proper\npolitical community is a bounded one; that it possesses ultimate\npolitical authority; and that this authority enables political\nautonomy, so that the members of the demos may freely choose\nthe conditions of their own association and legislate for themselves.\nThe normative core of this conception of democracy lies in the\nconception of freedom articulated in the third condition: that the\nsubject of legal constraints is free precisely in being the author of\nthe laws. Earlier we introduced Habermas's argument for\n“decentering” democracy under the conditions of pluralism\nand complexity. If this applies to the modern state, then it would seem\nthat cosmopolitan democracy would take this trend even further. Yet,\nwhen discussing “postnational” legitimacy, Habermas clearly\nmakes self-determination by a singular demos the fundamental\nnormative core of the democratic ideal. \n\nFor Held (1995), cosmopolitan democracy is clearly continuous with\ndemocracy, at least in form, as it is realized within states. Not only\ndoes Held show how international society is already thickly\ninstitutionalized well beyond the systems of negotiation that Habermas\nmakes central, he further recognizes that “individuals\nincreasingly have complex and multilayered identities, corresponding to\nthe globalization of economic forces and the reconfiguration of\npolitical power.” Such potentially overlapping identities provide\nthe basis for participation in global civil society, in nongovernmental\norganizations (NGOs), and in other transnational civil associations,\nmovements, and agencies that create opportunities for political\nparticipation at the global level. Held's approach thus has three\nenormous advantages: an emphasis on a variety of institutions; a\nmultiplicity of levels and sites for common democratic activity; and a\nfocus on the need for organized political actors in international civil\nsociety to play an important role in a system of global democracy. For\nall these advantages, the self-legislating demos reappears in\nHeld's explicitly Lockean insistence that “the artificial\nperson at the center of the modern state must be reconceived in terms\nof cosmopolitan public law.” In order to reconstitute the\ncommunity as sovereign, Held argues that the demoi must submit\nto the will of the global demos: “cosmopolitan law\ndemands the subordination of regional, national and local sovereignties\nto an overarching legal framework.”  \n\nContrary to his earlier essay on Kant's Perpetual Peace, Habermas has\nnow pulled back from Held's strong conception of cosmopolitanism. In\nThe Postnational Constellation (2001a; German ed., 1998c) and\nmore recent essays on the European Union, Habermas seeks to\naccommodate a wider institutional pluralism. Still, he cannot have it\nboth ways. When considering various disaggregated and distributed\nforms of transnational political order, he describes them in\nnondemocratic terms, as a “negotiating system” governed by\nfair bargaining. This is because he clearly, and indeed surprisingly,\nmakes self-determination through legislation the deciding criterion of\ndemocracy. Consequently, at the transnational level, the fundamental\nform of political activity is negotiation among democracies. This\ndemos is at best a civic, rather than political,\ntransnational order. Nonetheless, Habermas links the possibility of a\n“postnational democracy” to a shared and therefore\nparticular political identity, without which, he contends, we are left\nwith mere “moral” rather than “civic”\nsolidarity. According to Habermas, even if such a political community\nis based on the universal principles of a democratic constitution,\n“it still forms a collective identity, in the sense that it\ninterprets and realizes these principles in light of its own history\nand in the context of its own particular form of life” (2001a,\n117, 107). Without a common ethical basis, institutions beyond the\nstate must look to a “less demanding basis of legitimacy in the\norganizational forms of an international negotiation system,”\nthe deliberative processes of which will be accessible to various\npublics and to organizations in international civil society (ibid.,\n109).  \n\nMore recently, he argues that regulatory political institutions at\nthe global level could be effective only if they take on features of\ngovernance without government, even if human rights as juridical\nstatuses must be constitutionalized in the international system (2004,\n130–31). As in the case of Allen Buchanan's minimalism, this less\ndemanding standard of legitimacy does not include the capacity to\ndeliberate about the terms governing the political authority of the\nnegotiation system itself. This position is transnational, but\nultimately nondemocratic, primarily because it restricts its overly\nrobust deliberative democracy to the level of the nation state. The\nstronger criteria for democracy are not applied outside the nation\nstate, where governance is only indirectly democratic and left to\nnegotiations and policy networks. Furthermore, the commitment to human\nrights as legal statuses pushes Habermas in the direction of\nHeld's fundamentally legal form of political cosmopolitanism. At\nthe moment, Habermas's view of cosmopolitan politics is not yet\nfully stable. But it is clear that he thinks that a cosmopolitan order\nmust be political (and not merely juridical); institutional (and not\nmerely organized informally or by policy networks); transnational (to\nthe extent that it would be like the European Union, an order of\npolitical and legal orders); and in some sense democratic or at least\nsubject to democratic norms. However, in order for him to fully adopt\nthis last characteristic of the international system, he will have to\nrethink his conception of democracy as self-legislation. If he does not\ndo so, it seems impossible to fit democracy onto a transnational rather\nthan fully Kantian cosmopolitan order. \n\nOn the topic of religion, Habermas has taken a nuanced position that\ncontinues to develop. In his Theory of Communicative Action,\nhe treated religion primarily from a sociological perspective, as an\narchaic mode of social integration. Since then, however, he has\nexplored the role of religion in politics, on the one hand, and the\nrelationships between religious and philosophical modes of discourse,\non the other. \n\nAs a philosopher, Habermas has described his approach as a\n“methodological atheism,” by which he means a kind of\nexperiment in radical demythologization whose outcome remains open.\nTaking this stance does not make him hostile or dismissive of faith and\ntheological reflection; on the contrary, he grants that “indispensable\npotentials for meaning are preserved in religious\nlanguage”—potentials that, at least so far, have not been\nfully reduced to philosophical and secular reasons (2002, 77, 162). At\nthe same time, Habermas insists on the difference between theological\nand philosophical modes of discourse: as a reflection on faith,\ntheology must not renounce its basis in religious experience and\nritual. Consequently, he resists apologetic attempts to generate\nreligious belief from philosophical premises. Rather, philosophers must\nsatisfy themselves with the “transcendence from within”\ngiven with the context-transcending force of claims to truth and moral\nrightness.  \n\nHabermas has further developed his views on the relation between\nphilosophy and faith in his dialogue with Cardinal Ratzinger (who\nwould become Pope Benedict XVI)(2006b; German ed., 2005a; see also\n2008, chap. 4). There he notes how much Western philosophy owes to its\nChristian heritage, which philosophers assimilated by developing ideas\nof “responsibility, autonomy and justification; history and\nremembering; new beginning, innovation, and return; alienation,\ninternalization, and incarnation; individuality and community”\n(2006b, 44; trans. amended). The Christian idea of human beings as\ncreated in the image of God has been especially important for Western\nmoral-political theory, which translated the religious idea into the\nsecular view of persons as equal in dignity and deserving\nunconditional respect (ibid., 45). This assimilation of Christian\nideas does not gut their substance, however.  In fact, religious\ncommunities still harbor potentials of meaning from which philosophy\ncan learn—potentials that have “been lost elsewhere and\nthat cannot be restored by the professional knowledge of experts\nalone” (ibid., 43). As examples, he refers to the\n“differentiated possibilities of expression” and\n“sensitivities” regarding “lives that have gone\nastray, societal pathologies, the failure of individual life projects,\nand the deformation of misbegotten human relationships” (ibid.,\ntrans. amended). In acknowledging that religious modes of expression\ncan harbor an integral cognitive content that is not exhausted by\nsecular translations, Habermas seems to have located the boundaries of\nhis methodological experiment in demythologization. He thus calls for\na dialogue in which secular and religious forms of thought mutually\ninform and learn from each other.  \n\nThis broad point on the relation between religious and secular modes\nof thought flows directly into the position Habermas takes in his\n“Religion in the Public Sphere“ regarding the relation\nbetween religion and public reasons (2006a; German ed., 2005b,\nchap. 5). At the center of contention are the duties of believing\ncitizens to translate their religiously based claims into secular,\npublicly accessible reasons. Habermas stakes out his position between\nJohn Rawls and Robert Audi, on the one side, and Paul Weithmann and\nNicholas Wolterstorff, on the other. \n\nAudi places the heaviest burden on believers, requiring them to\nsupport only those laws for which they have sufficient public reasons;\neach citizen thus has a duty to translate religiously based arguments\ninto secular ones. In his final statement on this issue, Rawls (1997)\npresents a “wide view” of public reason, according to which\ncitizens may introduce reasons from reasonable comprehensive doctrines\n(which can include religious views), without translation, at any time\ninto public discourse about constitutional essentials, provided that at\nsome point in the future these reasons are translated into generally\naccessible public arguments. For Habermas, Audi and Rawls underestimate\nthe existential force of religious belief—how such belief can, at\nleast for some believers, provide the only sufficient basis for their\npolitical views, even when public reasons might also be taken as\nsupporting the views in question. The demand that believers translate\ntheir comprehensive religious views into secular justifications imposes\nundue burdens on believers of this sort. The demand for translation,\nrather, pertains only to politicians and public officials with\ninstitutional power to make, apply, and execute the law.  \n\nAs Habermas reads them, Weithmann and Wolterstorff take the opposite\nline from Rawls and Audi, opening up public discourse to untranslated\nreligious arguments. Weithmann requires believers to argue for their\npositions as good for everyone, but he allows them to frame such\narguments within their religiously based conception of justice.\nWolterstorff removes even this mild constraint. Both thinkers do not\nimpose any institutional filter: not only in the public sphere but also\nin the halls of power, religious reasons can suffice to justify\ncoercive legal and administrative decisions. This move, Habermas\nmaintains, undoes the neutrality principle that undergirds modern\nconstitutional democracy, with its separation of church and state: the\nidea that “all enforceable political decisions must be\nformulated in a language that is equally accessible to all\ncitizens, and it must be possible to justify them in this\nlanguage as well” (2006a, 12). Indeed, Wolterstorff seems to\nreject a key idea behind democratic legitimation, namely the\npresumption that procedures and decisions should operate within a\nbackground framework of principles acceptable to all citizens.\nConsequently, it is unclear how a democracy should maintain its\nlegitimacy and avoid devolving into an endless strife of factions\nsimply vying for power. \n\nIn the background of these debates lay contention over the burdens\nof citizenship. Believers might object that Habermas still places an\nasymmetric burden on them. After all, they must eventually, at the\ninstitutional level, shift over to secular modes of justification,\nwhereas non-believers need not carry out the same kind of move toward\nreligious justification. In response, Habermas has offered the\nhypothesis that both believers and non-believers are involved in a\ncomplementary learning process in which each side can learn from the\nother. As a cooperative learning process, translation makes demands on\nboth sides: the believer must seek publicly accessible arguments,\nwhereas the non-believer must approach religion as a potential source\nof meaning, as harboring truths about human existence that are relevant\nfor all.  \n\nIn closing, we suggest three possible extensions to Habermas's\nreply to believers. First, one might note that in the West at least,\nChristians are not so burdened as one might think. After all, some of\nthe most important secular ideas that inform constitutional\ndemocracy—ideas of inalienable individual rights, liberty, and\nthe like—partly originated in Christianity. Second, one might\npoint out that a reverse duty of translation on non-believers would\ninvolve a far heavier burden than that on believers, particularly in\nlight of the first point. This is because some religious reasons,\nthough they might have a surface intelligibility as propositions to\nnon-believers, cannot be adequately appreciated or weighed apart from\nprolonged experience of living the faith. Although it remains important\nfor non-believers to learn from believers, one should probably expect\nbelievers to have an epistemic advantage in the translation process,\nthat is, the process of determining whether or not a given secular\ncontent adequately renders a religiously based reason. So if believers\nhave the greater burden, then that makes sense: believers are actually\nin a better position to make the translation. \n\nOne might object that the second point presupposes an asymmetry\nbetween public secular reasons, to which both sides have access in\nprinciple, and religious reasons, to which only believers have initial\nand direct access. However, that objection supports Habermas's\nposition, and so leads into the third extension of his view. The\nobjection calls into question the assumption that everyone should in\nprinciple have equal access to secular reason. Once we question that\nassumption, it is unclear why secular reasons should have a privileged\nplace in political discourse. However, to reject the public position of\nsecular reasons, at least in a pluralistic polity, is to say there is\nno public reason. Rather, each citizen's perspective, religious\nor not, is comprehensive and somewhat opaque to others. In that case,\nhowever, every citizen now faces burdens of translation that she can\nshoulder only with the interlocutor's assistance. So the believer\nis not relieved of translation. Instead, everyone is now burdened by\ntranslation. To be sure, one might also remove the asymmetry between\naccess to secular and religious reason by making each sort of discourse\nequally accessible to all in principle. But that view hardly does\njustice to the existential import of religious experience, and so\nshould be rejected by believers."}]
