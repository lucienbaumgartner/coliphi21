Objects of discovery can be things, events,\nprocesses, causes, and properties as well as theories and hypotheses\nand their features (their explanatory power, for example). Most\nphilosophical discussions of scientific discoveries focus on the\ngeneration of new hypotheses that fit or explain given data sets or\nallow for the derivation of testable consequences. Philosophical\ndiscussions of scientific discovery have been intricate and complex\nbecause the term “discovery” has been used in many\ndifferent ways, both to refer to the outcome and to the procedure of\ninquiry. In the narrowest sense, the term “discovery”\nrefers to the purported “eureka moment” of having a new\ninsight. In the broadest sense, “discovery” is a synonym\nfor “successful scientific endeavor” tout court. Some\nphilosophical disputes about the nature of scientific discovery\nreflect these terminological variations.\n\n\n\nPhilosophical issues related to scientific discovery arise about the\nnature of human creativity, specifically about whether the\n“eureka moment” can be analyzed and about whether there\nare rules (algorithms, guidelines, or heuristics) according to which\nsuch a novel insight can be brought about. Philosophical issues also\narise about rational heuristics, about the characteristics of\nhypotheses worthy of articulation and testing, and, on the meta-level,\nabout the nature and scope of philosophical reflection itself. This\nessay describes the emergence and development of the philosophical\nproblem of scientific discovery, surveys different philosophical\napproaches to understanding scientific discovery, and presents the\nmeta-philosophical problems surrounding the debates.\n\n\n\nPhilosophical reflection on scientific discovery occurred in different\nphases. Prior to the 1930s, philosophers were mostly concerned with\ndiscoveries in the broadest sense of the term, that is, with the\nanalysis of successful scientific inquiry as a whole.  Philosophical\ndiscussions focused on the question of whether there were any\ndiscernible patterns in the production of new knowledge. Because the\nconcept of discovery did not have a specified meaning and was used in\na very broad sense, almost all seventeenth- and eighteenth-century\ntreatises on scientific method could potentially be considered as\nearly contributions to reflections on scientific discovery. In the\ncourse of the 19th century, as philosophy of science and\nscience became two distinct endeavors, the term\n“discovery” became a technical term in philosophical\ndiscussions. Different elements of scientific inquiry were\nspecified. Most importantly, the generation of new knowledge was\nclearly and explicitly distinguished from its validation, and thus the\nconditions for the narrower notion of discovery as the act or process of\nconceiving new ideas emerged. \nThe next phase in the discussion about scientific discovery began with\nthe introduction of the so-called “context distinction,”\nthe distinction between the “context of discovery” and the\n“context of justification”. It was further argued that\nconceiving a new idea is a non-rational process, a leap of\ninsight that cannot be captured in specific instructions. Justification, by contrast, is a\nsystematic process of applying evaluative criteria to knowledge\nclaims. Advocates of the context distinction argued that philosophy of\nscience is exclusively concerned with the context of\njustification. The assumption underlying this argument is that\nphilosophy is a normative project; it determines norms for scientific\npractice. Given these assumptions, only the justification of ideas,\nnot their generation, can be the subject of philosophical (normative)\nanalysis. Discovery, by contrast, can only be a topic for empirical\nstudy. By definition, the study of discovery is outside the scope of\nphilosophy of science proper. \nThe introduction of the context distinction and the disciplinary\ndistinction that was tied to it spawned meta-philosophical disputes.\nFor a long time, philosophical debates about discovery were shaped by\nthe notion that philosophical and empirical analyses are mutually\nexclusive. A number of philosophers insisted, like their predecessors\nprior to the 1930s, that the philosopher’s tasks include the analysis\nof actual scientific practices and that scientific resources be used\nto address philosophical problems. They also maintained that it is a\nlegitimate task for philosophy of science to develop a theory of\nheuristics or problem solving. But this position was the minority view\nduring much of 20th-century philosophy of science.\nPhilosophers of discovery were thus compelled to demonstrate that\nscientific discovery was in fact a legitimate part of philosophy of\nscience. Philosophical reflections about the nature of scientific\ndiscovery had to be bolstered by meta-philosophical arguments about\nthe nature and scope of philosophy of science. \nToday, however, there is wide agreement that philosophy and empirical\nresearch are not mutually exclusive. Not only do empirical studies of\nactual scientific discoveries inform philosophical thought about the\nstructure and cognitive mechanisms of discovery, but researches in\npsychology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence and related\nfields have become an integral part of philosophical analyses of the\nprocesses and conditions of the generation of new knowledge. \n\nPrior to the 19th century, the term “discovery”\ncommonly referred to the product of successful\ninquiry. “Discovery” was used broadly to refer to a new\nfinding, such as a new cure, an improvement of an instrument, or a new\nmethod of measuring longitude. Several natural and experimental\nphilosophers, notably Bacon, Descartes, and Newton, expounded accounts\nof scientific methods for arriving at new knowledge. These accounts\nwere not explicitly labeled “methods\nof discovery”, but the general accounts of scientific\nmethods are nevertheless relevant for current philosophical debates\nabout scientific discovery. They are relevant because philosophers of\nscience have frequently presented 17th-century theories of\nscientific method as a contrast class to current philosophies of\ndiscovery. The distinctive feature of the 17th- and\n18th-century accounts of scientific method is that the\nmethods are taken to have probative force (Nickles 1985). This means that those\naccounts of scientific method function as guides for acquiring new\nknowledge and at the same time as validations of the knowledge thus\nobtained (Laudan 1980; Schaffner 1993: chapter 2). \nBacon’s account of the “new method” as it is presented in\nthe Novum Organum is a prominent example. Bacon’s work showed\nhow best to arrive at knowledge about “form natures” (the\nmost general properties of matter) via a systematic investigation of\nphenomenal natures. Bacon described how first to collect and organize\nnatural phenomena and experimental facts in tables, how to evaluate\nthese lists, and how to refine the initial results with the help of\nfurther experiments.  Through these steps, the investigator would\narrive at conclusions about the “form nature” that\nproduces particular phenomenal natures. The point is that for Bacon,\nthe procedures of constructing and evaluating tables and conducting\nexperiments according to the Novum Organum leads to secure\nknowledge. The procedures thus have “probative force”. \nSimilarly, Newton’s aim in the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia\nMathematica was to present a method for the deduction of\npropositions from phenomena in such a way that those propositions\nbecome “more secure” than propositions that are secured by\ndeducing testable consequences from them (Smith 2002).  Newton did not\nassume that this procedure would lead to absolute certainty. One could\nonly obtain moral certainty for the propositions thus secured. The\npoint for current philosophers of science is that these approaches are\ngenerative theories of scientific method.  Generative theories of\nscientific method assume that propositions can only be established and\nsecured by showing that they follow from observed and experimentally\nproduced phenomena. In contrast, non-generative theories of scientific\nmethod—such as the one proposed by Huygens—assumed that\npropositions must be established by comparing their consequences with\nobserved and experimentally produced phenomena. In\n20th-century philosophy of science, this approach is often\ncharacterized as “consequentialist” (Laudan 1980; Nickles\n1985). \nRecent philosophers of science have used historical sketches like\nthese to reconstruct the prehistory of current philosophical debates\nabout scientific discovery. The argument is that scientific discovery\nbecame a problem for philosophy of science in the 19th\ncentury, when consequentialist theories of scientific method became\nmore widespread. When consequentialist theories were on the rise, the\ntwo processes of conception and validation of an idea or hypothesis\nbecame distinct, and the view that the merit of a new idea does not\ndepend on the way in which it was arrived at became widely\naccepted. \n\nIn the course of the 19th century, the act of having an\ninsight—the purported “eureka moment”—was\nseparated from processes of articulating, developing, and testing the\nnovel insight. Philosophical discussion focused on the question of\nwhether and to what extent rules could be devised to guide each of\nthese processes. William Whewell’s work, especially the two volumes\nof Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences of 1840, is an\nimportant contribution to the philosophical debates about scientific\ndiscovery precisely because he clearly separated the creative moment\nor “happy thought” as he called it from other elements of\nscientific inquiry. For Whewell, discovery comprised all three\nelements: the happy thought, the articulation and development of that\nthought, and the testing or verification of it. In most of the\nsubsequent treatments of discovery, however, the scope of the term\n“discovery” is limited to either the first of these\nelements, the “happy thought”, or to the first two of\nthese elements, the happy thought and its articulation. In fact, much\nof the controversies in the 20th century about the\npossibility of a philosophy of discovery can be understood against the\nbackground of the disagreement about whether the process of discovery\ndoes or does not include the articulation and development of a novel\nthought. \nThe previous section shows that scholars like Bacon and Newton aimed\nto develop methodologies of scientific inquiry. They proposed\n“new methods” or “rules of reasoning” that\nguide the generation of certain propositions from observed and\nexperimental phenomena. Whewell, by contrast, was explicitly concerned\nwith developing a philosophy of discovery. His account was in part a\ndescription of the psychological makeup of the discoverer. For\ninstance, he held that only geniuses could have those happy thoughts\nthat are essential to discovery. In part, his account was an account\nof the methods by which happy thoughts are integrated into the system\nof knowledge. According to Whewell, the initial step in every\ndiscovery is what he called “some happy thought, of which we\ncannot trace the origin; some fortunate cast of intellect, rising\nabove all rules. No maxims can be given which inevitably lead to\ndiscovery” (Whewell 1996 [1840]: 186). An “art of\ndiscovery” in the sense of a teachable and learnable skill does\nnot exist according to Whewell. The happy thought builds on the known\nfacts, but according to Whewell it is impossible to prescribe a method\nfor having happy thoughts. \nIn this sense, happy thoughts are accidental. But in an important\nsense, scientific discoveries are not accidental. The happy\nthought is not a wild guess. Only the person whose mind\nis prepared to see things will actually notice them. The\n“previous condition of the intellect, and not the single fact,\nis really the main and peculiar cause of the success. The fact is\nmerely the occasion by which the engine of discovery is brought into\nplay sooner or later. It is, as I have elsewhere said, only the spark\nwhich discharges a gun already loaded and pointed; and there is little\npropriety in speaking of such an accident as the cause why the bullet\nhits its mark.” (Whewell 1996 [1840]: 189). \nHaving a happy thought is not yet a discovery, however. The second\nelement of a scientific discovery consists in binding\ntogether—“colligating”, as Whewell called it—a\nset of facts by bringing them under a general conception. Not only\ndoes the colligation produce something new, but it also shows the\npreviously known facts in a new light. More precisely, colligation\nworks from both ends, from the facts as well as from the ideas that\nbind the facts together. Colligation is an extended process. It\ninvolves, on the one hand, the specification of facts through\nsystematic observation, measurements and experiment, and on the other\nhand, the clarification of ideas through the exposition of the\ndefinitions and axioms that are tacitly implied in those ideas. This\nprocess is iterative. The scientists go back and forth between binding\ntogether the facts, clarifying the idea, rendering the facts more\nexact, and so forth. \nThe final part of the discovery is the verification of the colligation\ninvolving the happy thought. This means, first and foremost, that the\noutcome of the colligation must be sufficient to explain the data at\nhand. Verification also involves judging the predictive power,\nsimplicity, and “consilience” of the outcome of the\ncolligation. “Consilience” refers to a higher range of\ngenerality (broader applicability) of the theory (the articulated and\nclarified happy thought) that the actual colligation\nproduced. Whewell’s account of discovery is not a deductivist\nsystem. It is essential that the outcome of the colligation be\ninferable from the data prior to any testing (Snyder 1997). \nWhewell’s theory of discovery is significant for the philosophical\ndebate about scientific discovery because it clearly separates three\nelements: the non-analyzable happy thought or eureka\nmoment; the process of colligation which includes the\nclarification and explication of facts and ideas; and the verification\nof the outcome of the colligation. His position that the philosophy of\ndiscovery cannot prescribe how to think happy thoughts has been a key\nelement of 20th-century philosophical reflection on\ndiscovery. Notably, however, Whewell’s conception of discovery not\nonly comprises the happy thoughts but also the processes by which the\nhappy thoughts are to be integrated into the given system of\nknowledge. The procedures of articulation and test are both\nanalyzable according to Whewell, and his conception of colligation and\nverification serve as guidelines for how the discoverer should\nproceed. A colligation, if properly done, has as such\njustificatory force. Similarly, the process of verification is an\nintegral part of discovery and it too has justificatory force.\nWhewell’s conception of verification thus comprises elements of\ngenerative and consequential methods of inquiry. To verify a\nhypothesis, the investigator needs to show that it accounts for the\nknown facts, that it foretells new, previously unobserved phenomena,\nand that it can explain and predict phenomena which are explained and\npredicted by a hypothesis that was obtained through an independent\nhappy thought-cum-colligation (Ducasse 1951). \nWhewell’s conceptualization of scientific discovery offers a useful\nframework for mapping the philosophical debates about discovery and\nfor identifying major issues of concern in recent philosophical\ndebates. First and foremost, nearly all recent philosophers operate\nwith a notion of discovery that is narrower than Whewell’s. In the\nnarrower conception, what Whewell called “verification” is\nnot part of discovery proper. Secondly, until the late 20th\ncentury, there was wide agreement that the eureka\nmoment, narrowly construed, is an unanalyzable, even mysterious\nleap of insight. The main disagreements concerned the question of\nwhether the process of developing a hypothesis (the\n“colligation” in Whewell’s terms) is, or is not, a part of\ndiscovery proper – and if it is, whether and how this process is guided\nby rules. Philosophers also disagreed on the issue of whether it is a\nphilosophical task to explicate these rules. In recent decades,\nphilosophical attention has shifted to the eureka\nmoment.  Drawing on resources from cognitive science,\nneuroscience, computational research, and environmental and social\npsychology, philosophers have sought to demystify the cognitive\nprocesses involved in the generation of new ideas. \n\nIn the early 20th century, the view that discovery is or at\nleast crucially involves a non-analyzable creative act of a gifted\ngenius was widespread but not unanimously accepted. Alternative\nconceptions of discovery emphasize that discovery is an extended\nprocess, i.e., that the discovery process includes the reasoning\nprocesses through which a new insight is articulated and further\ndeveloped. Moreover, it was assumed that there is a systematic, formal\naspect to that reasoning. While the reasoning involved does not\nproceed according to the principles of demonstrative logic, it is\nsystematic enough to deserve the label\n“logical”. Proponents of this view argued that traditional\n(here: Aristotelian) logic is an inadequate model of scientific\ndiscovery because it misrepresents the process of knowledge generation\nas grossly as the notion of “happy thought”. In this\napproach, the term “logic” is used in the broad sense. It\nis the task of the logic of discovery to draw out and give a schematic\nrepresentation of the reasoning strategies that were applied in\nepisodes of successful scientific inquiry. Early\n20th-century logics of discovery can best be described as\ntheories of the mental operations involved in knowledge\ngeneration. Among these mental operations are classification,\ndetermination of what is relevant to an inquiry, and the conditions of\ncommunication of meaning. It is argued that these features of\nscientific discovery are either not or only insufficiently represented by\ntraditional logic (Schiller 1917: 236–7). \nPhilosophers advocating this approach agree that the logic of\ndiscovery should be characterized as a set of heuristic principles\nrather than as a process of applying inductive or deductive logic to a\nset of propositions. These heuristic principles are not understood to\nshow the path to secure knowledge. Heuristic principles are suggestive\nrather than demonstrative (Carmichael 1922, 1930). One recurrent\nfeature in these accounts of the reasoning strategies leading to new\nideas is analogical reasoning (Schiller 1917; Benjamin 1934). In the\n20th century, it is widely acknowledged that analogical\nreasoning is a productive form of reasoning that cannot be reduced to\ninductive or deductive inferences (see also section 9.2.). However, these approaches to the\nlogic of discovery remained scattered and tentative at that time, and\nattempts to develop more systematically the heuristics guiding\ndiscovery processes were eclipsed by the advance of the distinction\nbetween contexts of discovery and justification. \n\nThe distinction between “context of discovery” and\n“context of justification” dominated and shaped the\ndiscussions about discovery in 20th-century philosophy of\nscience. The context distinction marks the distinction between the\ngeneration of a new idea or hypothesis and the defense (test,\nverification) of it. As the previous sections have shown, the\ndistinction among different features of scientific inquiry has a\nlonger history, but in philosophy of science it became potent in the\nfirst half of the 20th century. In the course of the\nensuing discussions about scientific discovery, the distinction\nbetween the different features of scientific inquiry turned into a\npowerful demarcation criterion. The boundary between context of\ndiscovery (the de facto thinking processes) and context of\njustification (the de jure defense of the correctness of\nthese thoughts) was now understood to determine the scope of\nphilosophy of science. The underlying assumption is that philosophy of\nscience is a normative endeavor. Advocates of the context distinction\nargue that the generation of a new idea is an intuitive, nonrational\nprocess; it cannot be subject to normative analysis. Therefore, the\nstudy of scientists’ actual thinking can only be the subject of\npsychology, sociology, and other empirical sciences. Philosophy of\nscience, by contrast, is exclusively concerned with the context of\njustification. \nThe terms “context of discovery” and “context of\njustification” are often associated with Hans Reichenbach’s\nwork. Reichenbach’s original conception of the context distinction is\nquite complex, however (Howard 2006; Richardson 2006).  It does not\nmap easily on to the disciplinary distinction mentioned above, because\nfor Reichenbach, philosophy of science proper is partly\ndescriptive. Reichenbach maintains that philosophy of science includes\na description of knowledge as it really is. Descriptive philosophy of\nscience reconstructs scientists’ thinking processes in such a way that\nlogical analysis can be performed on them, and it thus prepares the\nground for the evaluation of these thoughts (Reichenbach 1938: §\n1). Discovery, by contrast, is the object of\nempirical—psychological, sociological—study. According to\nReichenbach, the empirical study of discoveries shows that processes\nof discovery often correspond to the principle of induction, but this\nis simply a psychological fact (Reichenbach 1938: 403). \nWhile the terms “context of discovery” and “context\nof justification” are widely used, there has been ample\ndiscussion about how the distinction should be drawn and what their\nphilosophical significance is (c.f. Kordig 1978; Gutting 1980; Zahar\n1983; Leplin 1987; Hoyningen-Huene 1987; Weber 2005: chapter 3;\nSchickore and Steinle 2006). Most commonly, the distinction is\ninterpreted as a distinction between the process of conceiving a\ntheory and the validation of that theory, that is, the determination\nof the theory’s epistemic support. This version of the distinction is\nnot necessarily interpreted as a temporal distinction. In other words,\nit is not usually assumed that a theory is first fully developed and\nthen validated. Rather, conception and validation are two different\nepistemic approaches to theory: the endeavor to articulate, flesh out,\nand develop its potential and the endeavor to assess its epistemic\nworth. Within the framework of the context distinction, there are two\nmain ways of conceptualizing the process of conceiving a theory. The\nfirst option is to characterize the generation of new knowledge as an\nirrational act, a mysterious creative intuition, a “eureka\nmoment”. The second option is to conceptualize the generation of\nnew knowledge as an extended process that includes a creative\nact as well as some process of articulating and developing the\ncreative idea. \nBoth of these accounts of knowledge generation served as starting\npoints for arguments against the possibility of a philosophy of\ndiscovery. In line with the first option, philosophers have argued\nthat neither is it possible to prescribe a logical method that\nproduces new ideas nor is it possible to reconstruct logically the\nprocess of discovery. Only the process of testing is amenable to\nlogical investigation. This objection to philosophies of discovery has\nbeen called the “discovery machine objection” (Curd 1980:\n207).  It is usually associated with Karl Popper’s Logic of\nScientific Discovery. \nThe initial state, the act of conceiving or inventing a theory, seems\nto me neither to call for logical analysis not to be susceptible of\nit. The question how it happens that a new idea occurs to a\nman—whether it is a musical theme, a dramatic conflict, or a\nscientific theory—may be of great interest to empirical\npsychology; but it is irrelevant to the logical analysis of scientific\nknowledge. This latter is concerned not with questions of\nfact (Kant’s quid facti?), but only with\nquestions of justification or validity (Kant’s quid\njuris?). Its questions are of the following kind. Can a\nstatement be justified? And if so, how? Is it testable? Is it\nlogically dependent on certain other statements? Or does it perhaps\ncontradict them? […]Accordingly I shall distinguish sharply\nbetween the process of conceiving a new idea, and the methods and\nresults of examining it logically. As to the task of the logic of\nknowledge—in contradistinction to the psychology of\nknowledge—I shall proceed on the assumption that it consists\nsolely in investigating the methods employed in those systematic tests\nto which every new idea must be subjected if it is to be seriously\nentertained. (Popper 2002 [1934/1959]: 7–8) \n\nWith respect to the second way of conceptualizing knowledge\ngeneration, many philosophers argue in a similar fashion that because\nthe process of discovery involves an irrational, intuitive process,\nwhich cannot be examined logically, a logic of discovery cannot be\nconstrued. Other philosophers turn against the philosophy of discovery\neven though they explicitly acknowledge that discovery is an extended,\nreasoned process. They present a meta-philosophical objection\nargument, arguing that a theory of articulating and developing ideas\nis not a philosophical but a psychological theory. \nThe impact of the context distinction on studies of scientific\ndiscovery and on philosophy of science more generally can hardly be\noverestimated. The view that the process of discovery (however\nconstrued) is outside the scope of philosophy of science proper was\nwidely shared amongst philosophers of science for most of the\n20th century and is still held by many. The last section\nshows that there were a few attempts to develop logics of discovery in\nthe 1920s and 1930s. But for several decades, the context distinction\ndictated what philosophy of science should be about and how it should\nproceed. The dominant view was that theories of mental operations or\nheuristics had no place in philosophy of science. Therefore, discovery\nwas not a legitimate topic for philosophy of science. The wide notion\nof discovery is mostly deployed in sociological accounts of scientific\npractice. In this perspective, “discovery” is understood\nas a retrospective label, which is attributed as a sign of\naccomplishment to some scientific endeavors. Sociological theories\nacknowledge that discovery is a collective achievement and the outcome\nof a process of negotiation through which “discovery\nstories” are constructed and certain knowledge claims are\ngranted discovery status (Brannigan 1981; Schaffer 1986, 1994). Until\nthe last third of the 20th century, there were few attempts\nto challenge the disciplinary distinction tied to the context\ndistinction. Only in the 1970s did the interest in philosophical\napproaches to discovery begin to increase. But the context distinction\nremained a challenge for philosophies of discovery. \nThere are three main lines of response to the disciplinary distinction\ntied to the context distinction. Each of these lines of response opens\nup a philosophical perspective on discovery. Each proceeds on the\nassumption that philosophy of science may legitimately include some\nform of analysis of actual reasoning patterns as well as\ninformation from empirical sciences such as cognitive science,\npsychology, and sociology. All of these responses reject the idea that\ndiscovery is nothing but a mystical event. Discovery is conceived as\nan analyzable reasoning process, not just as a creative leap by which\nnovel ideas spring into being fully formed. All of these responses\nagree that the procedures and methods for arriving at new hypotheses\nand ideas are no guarantee that the hypothesis or idea that is thus\nformed is necessarily the best or the correct one. Nonetheless, it is\nthe task of philosophy of science to provide rules for making this\nprocess better. All of these responses can be described as theories of\nproblem solving, whose ultimate goal is to make the generation of new\nideas and theories more efficient. \nBut the different approaches to scientific discovery employ different\nterminologies. In particular, the term “logic” of\ndiscovery is sometimes used in a narrow sense and sometimes broadly\nunderstood. In the narrow sense, “logic” of discovery is\nunderstood to refer to a set of formal, generally applicable rules by\nwhich novel ideas can be mechanically derived from existing data. In\nthe broad sense, “logic” of discovery refers to the\nschematic representation of reasoning\nprocedures. “Logical” is just another term for\n“rational”. Moreover, while each of these responses\ncombines philosophical analyses of scientific discovery with empirical\nresearch on actual human cognition, different sets of resources are\nmobilized, ranging from AI research and cognitive science to\nhistorical studies of problem-solving procedures. Also, the responses\nparse the process of scientific inquiry differently. Often, scientific\ninquiry is regarded as having two aspects, viz. generation and\nvalidation of new ideas. At times, however, scientific inquiry is\nregarded as having three aspects, namely generation, pursuit or\narticulation, and validation of knowledge. In the latter framework,\nthe label “discovery” is sometimes used to refer just to\ngeneration and sometimes to refer to both generation and\npursuit. \nThe first response to the challenge of the context distinction draws\non a broad understanding of the term “logic” to argue that\nwe cannot but admit a general, domain-neutral logic if we do not want\nto assume that the success of science is a miracle (Jantzen 2016) and\nthat a logic of scientific discovery can be developed\n(section 6). The second response,\ndrawing on a narrow understanding of the term “logic”, is\nto concede that there is no logic of discovery, i.e., no\nalgorithm for generating new knowledge. Philosophers who take this\napproach argue that the process of discovery follows an identifiable,\nanalyzable pattern (section 7). Others argue\nthat discovery is governed by a methodology. The methodology\nof discovery is a legitimate topic for philosophical analysis\n(section 8).  All of these responses assume that\nthere is more to discovery than a eureka moment.\nDiscovery comprises processes of articulating and developing the\ncreative thought. These are the processes that can be examined with\nthe tools of philosophical analysis. The third response to the\nchallenge of the context distinction also assumes that discovery is or\nat least involves a creative act. But in contrast to the first two\nresponses, it is concerned with the creative act itself. Philosophers\nwho take this approach argue that scientific creativity is amenable to\nphilosophical analysis (section 9). \n\nThe first response to the challenge of the context distinction is to\nargue that discovery is a topic for philosophy of science because it\nis a logical process after all. Advocates of this approach to the\nlogic of discovery usually accept the overall distinction between the\ntwo processes of conceiving and testing a hypothesis. They also agree\nthat it is impossible to put together a manual that provides a formal,\nmechanical procedure through which innovative concepts or hypotheses\ncan be derived: There is no discovery machine. But they reject the\nview that the process of conceiving a theory is a creative act, a\nmysterious guess, a hunch, a more or less instantaneous and random\nprocess.  Instead, they insist that both conceiving and testing\nhypotheses are processes of reasoning and systematic inference, that\nboth of these processes can be represented schematically, and that it\nis possible to distinguish better and worse paths to new\nknowledge. \nThis line of argument has much in common with the logics of discovery\ndescribed in section 4 above but it is now\nexplicitly pitched against the disciplinary distinction tied to the\ncontext distinction.  There are two main ways of developing this\nargument. The first is to conceive of discovery in terms of abductive\nreasoning (section 6.1).  The second is to\nconceive of discovery in terms of problem-solving algorithms, whereby\nheuristic rules aid the processing of available data and enhance the\nsuccess in finding solutions to problems\n (section 6.2). Both lines of argument rely \non a broad conception of logic,\nwhereby the “logic” of discovery amounts to a schematic\naccount of the reasoning processes involved in knowledge\ngeneration. \n\nOne argument, elaborated prominently by Norwood R. Hanson, is that the\nact of discovery—here, the act of suggesting a new\nhypothesis—follows a distinctive logical pattern, which is\ndifferent from both inductive logic and the logic of\nhypothetico-deductive reasoning. The special logic of discovery is the\nlogic of abductive or “retroductive” inferences (Hanson\n1958).  The argument that it is through an act of abductive inferences\nthat plausible, promising scientific hypotheses are devised goes back\nto C.S. Peirce. This version of the logic of discovery characterizes\nreasoning processes that take place before a new hypothesis\nis ultimately justified. The abductive mode of reasoning that leads to\nplausible hypotheses is conceptualized as an inference beginning with\ndata or, more specifically, with surprising or anomalous\nphenomena. \nIn this view, discovery is primarily a process of explaining anomalies\nor surprising, astonishing phenomena. The scientists’ reasoning\nproceeds abductively from an anomaly to an explanatory hypothesis in\nlight of which the phenomena would no longer be surprising or\nanomalous. The outcome of this reasoning process is not one single\nspecific hypothesis but the delineation of a type of hypotheses that\nis worthy of further attention (Hanson 1965: 64).  According to\nHanson, the abductive argument has the following schematic form\n(Hanson 1960: 104): \n\nDrawing on the historical record, Hanson argues that several important\ndiscoveries were made relying on abductive reasoning, such as Kepler’s\ndiscovery of the elliptic orbit of Mars (Hanson 1958).  It is now\nwidely agreed, however, that Hanson’s reconstruction of the episode is\nnot a historically adequate account of Kepler’s discovery (Lugg\n1985). More importantly, while there is general agreement that\nabductive inferences are frequent in both everyday and scientific\nreasoning, these inferences are no longer considered\nas logical inferences. Even if one accepts Hanson’s schematic\nrepresentation of the process of identifying plausible hypotheses,\nthis process is a “logical” process only in the widest\nsense whereby the term “logical” is understood as\nsynonymous with “rational”. Notably, some philosophers\nhave even questioned the rationality of abductive inferences (Koehler\n1991; Brem and Rips 2000). \nAnother argument against the above schema is that it is too\npermissive. There will be several hypotheses that are explanations for\nphenomena p1, p2, p3\n…, so the fact that a particular hypothesis explains the\nphenomena is not a decisive criterion for developing that hypothesis\n(Harman 1965; see also Blackwell 1969). Additional criteria are\nrequired to evaluate the hypothesis yielded by abductive\ninferences. \nFinally, it is worth noting that the schema of abductive reasoning\ndoes not explain the very act of conceiving a hypothesis or\nhypothesis-type. The processes by which a new idea is first\narticulated remain unanalyzed in the above schema. The schema focuses\non the reasoning processes by which an exploratory hypothesis is\nassessed in terms of its merits and promise (Laudan 1980; Schaffner\n1993). \nIn more recent work on abduction and discovery, two notions of\nabduction are sometimes distinguished: the common notion of abduction\nas inference to the best explanation (selective abduction) and\ncreative abduction (Magnani 2000, 2009). Selective abduction—the\ninference to the best explanation—involves selecting a\nhypothesis from a set of known hypotheses. Medical diagnosis\nexemplifies this kind of abduction. Creative abduction, by contrast,\ninvolves generating a new, plausible hypothesis. This happens, for\ninstance, in medical research, when the notion of a new disease is\narticulated. However, it is still an open question whether this\ndistinction can be drawn, or whether there is a more gradual\ntransition from selecting an explanatory hypothesis from a familiar\ndomain (selective abduction) to selecting a hypothesis that is\nslightly modified from the familiar set and to identifying a more\ndrastically modified or altered assumption. \nAnother recent suggestion is to broaden Peirce’s original account of\nabduction and to include not only verbal information but also\nnon-verbal mental representations, such as visual, auditory, or motor\nrepresentations. In Thagard’s approach, representations are\ncharacterized as patterns of activity in mental populations (see\nalso section 9.3 below). The advantage of the\nneural account of human reasoning is that it covers features such as\nthe surprise that accompanies the generation of new insights or the\nvisual and auditory representations that contribute to it. Surprise, for instance, could be characterized as resulting from rapid changes in activation of the node in a neural network representing the “surprising” element (Thagard and Stewart 2011). If all\nmental representations can be characterized as patterns of firing in\nneural populations, abduction can be analyzed as the combination or\n“convolution” (Thagard) of patterns of neural activity\nfrom disjoint or overlapping patterns of activity (Thagard 2010). \n\nThe concern with the logic of discovery has also motivated research on\nartificial intelligence at the intersection of philosophy of science\nand cognitive science. In this approach, scientific discovery is\ntreated as a form of problem-solving activity (Simon 1973; see also\nNewell and Simon 1971), whereby the systematic aspects of problem\nsolving are studied within an information-processing framework. The\naim is to clarify with the help of computational tools the nature of\nthe methods used to discover scientific hypotheses. These hypotheses\nare regarded as solutions to problems. Philosophers working in this\ntradition build computer programs employing methods of heuristic\nselective search (e.g., Langley et al. 1987). In computational\nheuristics, search programs can be described as searches for solutions\nin a so-called “problem space” in a certain domain. The\nproblem space comprises all possible configurations in that domain\n(e.g., for chess problems, all possible arrangements of pieces on a\nboard of chess). Each configuration is a “state” of the\nproblem space. There are two special states, namely the goal state,\ni.e., the state to be reached, and the initial state, i.e., the\nconfiguration at the starting point from which the search\nbegins. There are operators, which determine the moves that generate\nnew states from the current state. There are path constraints, which\nlimit the permitted moves. Problem solving is the process of searching\nfor a solution of the problem of how to generate the goal state from\nan initial state. In principle, all states can be generated by\napplying the operators to the initial state, then to the resulting\nstate, until the goal state is reached (Langley et al. 1987: chapter\n9). A problem solution is a sequence of operations leading from the\ninitial to the goal state. \nThe basic idea behind computational heuristics is that rules can be\nidentified that serve as guidelines for finding a solution to a given\nproblem quickly and efficiently by avoiding undesired states of the\nproblem space. These rules are best described as rules of thumb. The\naim of constructing a logic of discovery thus becomes the aim of\nconstructing a heuristics for the efficient search for solutions to\nproblems. The term “heuristic search” indicates that in\ncontrast to algorithms, problem-solving procedures lead to results\nthat are merely provisional and plausible. A solution is not\nguaranteed, but heuristic searches are advantageous because they are\nmore efficient than exhaustive random trial and error\nsearches. Insofar as it is possible to evaluate whether one set of\nheuristics is better—more efficacious—than another, the\nlogic of discovery turns into a normative theory of discovery. \nArguably, because it is possible to reconstruct important scientific\ndiscovery processes with sets of computational heuristics, the\nscientific discovery process can be considered as a special case of\nthe general mechanism of information processing. In this context, the\nterm “logic” is not used in the narrow sense of a set of\nformal, generally applicable rules to draw inferences but again in a\nbroad sense as a label for a set of procedural rules. \nThe computer programs that embody the principles of heuristic searches\nin scientific inquiry simulate the paths that scientists followed when\nthey searched for new theoretical hypotheses. Computer programs such\nas BACON (Simon et al. 1981) and KEKADA (Kulkarni and Simon 1988)\nutilize sets of problem-solving heuristics to detect regularities in\ngiven data sets. The program would note, for instance, that the values\nof a dependent term are constant or that a set of values for a\nterm x and a set of values for a term y are linearly\nrelated. It would thus “infer” that the dependent term\nalways has that value or that a linear relation exists\nbetween x and y.  These programs can “make\ndiscoveries” in the sense that they can simulate successful\ndiscoveries such as Kepler’s third law (BACON) or the Krebs cycle\n(KEKADA). \nAI-based theories of scientific discoveries have helped identify and\nclarify a number of problem-solving strategies. An example of such a\nstrategy is heuristic means-ends analysis, which involves identifying\nspecific differences between the present and the goal situation and\nsearches for operators (processes that will change the situation) that\nare associated with the differences that were detected. Another\nimportant heuristic is to divide the problem into sub-problems and to\nbegin solving the one with the smallest number of unknowns to be\ndetermined (Simon 1977). AI-based approaches have also highlighted the\nextent to which the generation of new knowledge draws on existing\nknowledge that constrains the development of new hypotheses. \nAs accounts of scientific discoveries, computational heuristics have\nsome limitations. Most importantly, because computer programs require\nthe data from actual experiments the simulations cover only certain\naspects of scientific discoveries. They do not design new experiments,\ninstruments, or methods. Moreover, compared to the problem spaces\ngiven in computational heuristics, the complex problem spaces for\nscientific problems are often ill defined, and the relevant search\nspace and goal state must be delineated before heuristic assumptions\ncould be formulated (Bechtel and Richardson 1993: chapter 1). \nEarlier critics of AI-based theories of scientific discoveries\nargued that a computer cannot devise new concepts but is confined to\nthe concepts included in the given computer language (Hempel 1985:\n119–120). Subsequent work has shown that computational methods can be\nused to generate new results leading to refereed scientific\npublications in astronomy, cancer research, ecology, and other fields\n(Langley 2000). The most recent computational research on scientific\ndiscovery is no longer driven by philosophical interests in scientific\ndiscovery, however. Instead, the main motivation is to contribute\ncomputational tools to aid scientists in their research (Addis et al. 2016)  \n\nMany philosophers maintain that discovery is a legitimate topic for\nphilosophy of science while abandoning the notion that there is a\nlogic of discovery. One very influential approach is Thomas\nKuhn’s analysis of the emergence of novel facts and theories\n(Kuhn 1970 [1962]: chapter 6). Kuhn identifies a general pattern of discovery\nas part of his account of scientific change. A discovery is not a\nsimple act, but an extended, complex process, which culminates in\nparadigm changes. Paradigms are the symbolic generalizations,\nmetaphysical commitments, values, and exemplars that are shared by a\ncommunity of scientists and that guide the research of that community.\nParadigm-based, normal science does not aim at novelty but instead at\nthe development, extension, and articulation of accepted paradigms. A\ndiscovery begins with an anomaly, that is, with the recognition that\nthe expectations induced by an established paradigm are being violated.\nThe process of discovery involves several aspects: observations of an\nanomalous phenomenon, attempts to conceptualize it, and changes in the\nparadigm so that the anomaly can be accommodated. \nIt is the mark of success of normal science that it does not make\ntransformative discoveries, and yet such discoveries come about as a\nconsequence of normal, paradigm-guided science. The more detailed and\nthe better developed a paradigm, the more precise are its predictions.\nThe more precisely the researchers know what to expect, the better\nthey are able to recognize anomalous results and violations of\nexpectations:  novelty ordinarily emerges only for the man who,\nknowing with precision what he should expect, is able to recognize\nthat something has gone wrong. Anomaly appears only against the\nbackground provided by the paradigm. (Kuhn 1970 [1962]:\n65) \n\nDrawing on several historical examples, Kuhn argues that it is usually\nimpossible to identify the very moment when something was discovered\nor even the individual who made the discovery. Kuhn illustrates these\npoints with the discovery of oxygen (see Kuhn 1970 [1962]:\n53–56). Oxygen had not been discovered before 1774 and had been\ndiscovered by 1777. Even before 1774, Lavoisier had noticed that\nsomething was wrong with phlogiston theory, but he was unable to move\nforward. Two other investigators, C. W. Scheele and Joseph Priestley,\nindependently identified a gas obtained from heating solid substances.\nBut Scheele’s work remained unpublished until after 1777, and\nPriestley did not identify his substance as a new sort of gas. In\n1777, Lavoisier presented the oxygen theory of combustion, which gave\nrise to fundamental reconceptualization of chemistry. But according to\nthis theory as Lavoisier first presented it, oxygen was not a chemical\nelement. It was an atomic “principle of acidity” and\noxygen gas was a combination of that principle with caloric. According\nto Kuhn, all of these developments are part of the discovery of\noxygen, but none of them can be singled out as “the” act\nof discovery. \nIn pre-paradigmatic periods or in times of paradigm crisis,\ntheory-induced discoveries may happen. In these periods, scientists\nspeculate and develop tentative theories, which may lead to novel\nexpectations and experiments and observations to test whether these\nexpectations can be confirmed. Even though no precise predictions can\nbe made, phenomena that are thus uncovered are often not quite what\nhad been expected. In these situations, the simultaneous exploration\nof the new phenomena and articulation of the tentative hypotheses\ntogether bring about discovery. \nIn cases like the discovery of oxygen, by contrast, which took place\nwhile a paradigm was already in place, the unexpected becomes apparent\nonly slowly, with difficulty, and against some resistance. Only\ngradually do the anomalies become visible as such. It takes time for\nthe investigators to recognize “both that something is and what\nit is” (Kuhn 1970 [1962]: 55). Eventually, a new paradigm\nbecomes established and the anomalous phenomena become the expected\nphenomena. \nRecent studies in cognitive neuroscience of brain activity during\nperiods of conceptual change support Kuhn’s view that conceptual\nchange is hard to achieve. These studies examine the neural processes\nthat are involved in the recognition of anomalies and compare them\nwith the brain activity involved in the processing of information that\nis consistent with preferred theories. The studies suggest that the\ntwo types of data are processed differently (Dunbar et al. 2007). \n\nAdvocates of the view that there are methodologies of discovery use\nthe term “logic” in the narrow sense of an algorithmic\nprocedure to generate new ideas. But like the AI-based theories of\nscientific discovery described in\n section 6, methodologies of \nscientific discovery interpret the concept\n“discovery” as a label for an extended process of\ngenerating and articulating new ideas and often describe the process\nin terms of problem solving. In these approaches, the distinction\nbetween the contexts of discovery and the context of justification is\nchallenged because the methodology of discovery is understood to play\na justificatory role. Advocates of a methodology of discovery usually\nrely on a distinction between different justification procedures,\njustification involved in the process of generating new knowledge and\njustification involved in testing it. Consequential or\n“strong” justifications are methods of testing. The\njustification involved in discovery, by contrast, is conceived as\ngenerative (as opposed to consequential) justification\n(section 8.1) or as weak (as opposed to strong)\njustification (section 8.2). Again, some\nterminological ambiguity exists because according to some\nphilosophers, there are three contexts, not two: Only the initial\nconception of a new idea (the creative act is the\ncontext of discovery proper, and between it and justification there\nexists a separate context of pursuit (Laudan 1980). But many advocates\nof methodologies of discovery regard the context of pursuit as an\nintegral part of the process of justification. They retain the notion\nof two contexts and re-draw the boundaries between the contexts of\ndiscovery and justification as they were drawn in the early\n20th century. \n\nThe methodology of discovery has sometimes been characterized as a\nform of justification that is complementary to the methodology of\ntesting (Nickles 1984, 1985, 1989). According to the methodology of\ntesting, empirical support for a theory results from successfully\ntesting the predictive consequences derived from that theory (and\nappropriate auxiliary assumptions). In light of this methodology,\njustification for a theory is “consequential\njustification,” the notion that a hypothesis is established if\nsuccessful novel predictions are derived from the theory or\nclaim. Generative justification complements consequential\njustification. Advocates of generative justification hold that there\nexists an important form of justification in science that involves\nreasoning to a claim from data or previously established\nresults more generally. \nOne classic example for a generative methodology is the set of\nNewton’s rules for the study of natural philosophy. According to these\nrules, general propositions are established by deducing them from the\nphenomena. The notion of generative justification seeks to preserve\nthe intuition behind classic conceptions of justification by\ndeduction.  Generative justification amounts to the rational\nreconstruction of the discovery path in order to establish its\ndiscoverability had the researchers known what is known now,\nregardless of how it was first thought of (Nickles 1985, 1989). The\nreconstruction demonstrates in hindsight that the claim could have\nbeen discovered in this manner had the necessary information and\ntechniques been available. In other words, generative\njustification—justification as “discoverability” or\n“potential discovery”—justifies a knowledge claim by\nderiving it from results that are already established. While\ngenerative justification does not retrace exactly those steps of the\nactual discovery path that were actually taken, it is a better\nrepresentation of scientists’ actual practices than consequential\njustification because scientists tend to construe new claims from\navailable knowledge. Generative justification is a weaker version of\nthe traditional ideal of justification by deduction from the\nphenomena.  Justification by deduction from the phenomena is complete\nif a theory or claim is completely determined from what we already\nknow. The demonstration of discoverability results from the successful\nderivation of a claim or theory from the most basic and most solidly\nestablished empirical information. \n\nDiscoverability as described in the previous paragraphs is a mode of\njustification. Like the testing of novel predictions derived from a\nhypothesis, generative justification begins when the phase of finding\nand articulating a hypothesis worthy of assessing is drawing to a\nclose. Other approaches to the methodology of discovery are directly\nconcerned with the procedures involved in devising new hypotheses. The\nargument in favor of this kind of methodology is that the procedures\nof devising new hypotheses already include elements of\nappraisal. These preliminary assessments have been termed\n“weak” evaluation procedures (Schaffner 1993). Weak\nevaluations are relevant during the process of devising a new\nhypothesis. They provide reasons for accepting a hypothesis as\npromising and worthy of further attention.  Strong evaluations, by\ncontrast, provide reasons for accepting a hypothesis as\n(approximately) true or confirmed. Both “generative” and\n“consequential” testing as discussed in the previous\nsection are strong evaluation procedures.  Strong evaluation\nprocedures are rigorous and systematically organized according to the\nprinciples of hypothesis derivation or H-D testing. A methodology of\npreliminary appraisal, by contrast, articulates criteria for the\nevaluation of a hypothesis prior to rigorous derivation or testing. It\naids the decision about whether to take that hypothesis seriously\nenough to develop it further and test it. For advocates of this\nversion of the methodology of discovery, it is the task of philosophy\nof science to characterize sets of constraints and methodological\nrules guiding the complex process of prior-to-test evaluation of\nhypotheses. \nIn contrast to the computational approaches discussed above,\nstrategies of preliminary appraisal are not regarded as\nsubject-neutral but as specific to particular fields of study. Because\nthe analysis of criteria for the appraisal of hypotheses has mostly\nbeen made with regard to the study of biological mechanism, the\ncriteria and constraints that have been proposed are those that play a\nrole in the discovery of biological mechanisms. Biological mechanisms\nare entities and activities that are organized in such a way that they\nproduce regular changes from initial to terminal conditions (Machamer\net al.  2000). \nPhilosophers of biology have developed a fine-grained framework to\naccount for the generation and preliminary evaluation of these\nmechanisms (Darden 2002; Craver 2002; Bechtel and Richardson 1993;\nCraver and Darden 2013). Some philosophers have even suggested that\nthe phase of preliminary appraisal be further divided into two phases,\nthe phase of appraising and the phase of revising. According to\nLindley Darden, the phases of generation, appraisal and revision of\ndescriptions of mechanisms can be characterized as reasoning processes\ngoverned by reasoning strategies. Different reasoning strategies\ngovern the different phases (Darden 1991, 2002; Craver 2002; Darden\n2009). The generation of hypotheses about mechanisms, for instance, is\ngoverned by the strategy of “schema instantiation” (see\nDarden 2002). The discovery of the mechanism of protein synthesis\ninvolved the instantiation of an abstract schema for chemical\nreactions: reactant1 + reactant2 = product. The\nactual mechanism of protein synthesis was found through specification\nand modification of this schema. \nIt is important to appreciate the status of these reasoning\nstrategies. They are not necessarily strategies that were actually\nused. Neither of these strategies is deemed necessary for discovery,\nand they are not prescriptions for biological research. Rather, these\nstrategies are deemed sufficient for the discovery of mechanisms; they\n“could have been used” to arrive at the description of\nthat mechanism (Darden 2002). The methodology of the discovery of\nmechanisms is an extrapolation from past episodes of research on\nmechanisms and the result of a synthesis of rational reconstructions\nof several of these historical episodes. The methodology of discovery\nis only weakly normative in the sense that the strategies for the\ndiscovery of mechanisms that have been identified so far may prove\nuseful in future biological research. Moreover, the sets of reasoning\nstrategies that have been proposed are highly specific. It is still an\nopen question whether the analysis of strategies for the discovery of\nbiological mechanisms can illuminate the efficiency of scientific\nproblem solving more generally (Weber 2005: chapter 3). \n\nThe approaches to scientific discovery presented in the previous\nsections focus on the adoption, articulation, and preliminary\nevaluation of ideas or hypotheses prior to rigorous testing. They do\nnot illuminate how a novel hypothesis or idea is first thought\nup. Even among philosophers of discovery, the predominant view has\nlong been that there is an initial step of discovery that is best\ndescribed as a eureka moment, a mysterious intuitive leap of the human\nmind that cannot be analyzed further (but see Stokes 2011). \nThe concept of discovery as hypothesis-formation as it is encapsulated\nin the traditional distinction between context of discovery and\ncontext of justification does not explicate how new ideas are\nformed. According to accounts of discovery informed by evolutionary\nbiology, the generation of new ideas is akin to random, blind\nvariations of thought processes, which have to be inspected by the\ncritical mind and assessed as neutral, productive, or useless\n(Campbell 1960; see also Hull 1988). While the evolutionary approach\nto discovery offers a more substantial account of scientific\ndiscovery, the key processes by which random ideas are generated are\nstill left unanalyzed. \nToday, many philosophers hold the view that creativity is not\nmysterious and can be submitted to analysis. Psychologist Margaret Boden has\noffered helpful analyses of the concept of creativity. According to\nBoden, a new development is creative if it is novel, surprising, and\nimportant.  She distinguishes between psychological creativity\n(P-creativity) and historical creativity (H-creativity). P-creativity\nis a development that is new, surprising and important to the\nparticular person who comes up with it. H-creativity, by contrast, is\nradically novel, surprising, and important—it is generated for\nthe first time (Boden 2004). \nThe majority of recent philosophical studies of scientific discovery\ntoday focus on the act of generation of new knowledge. The distinctive\nfeature of these studies is that they integrate approaches from\ncognitive science, psychology, and computational neuroscience (Thagard\n2012, Pasquale and Poirier 2016). Recent work on creativity offers substantive analyses of the\nsocial and psychological preconditions and the cognitive mechanisms\ninvolved in generating new ideas. Some of this research aims to\ncharacterize those features that are common to all creative processes.\nOther research aims to identify the features that are distinctive of\nscientific creativity (as opposed to other forms of creativity, such\nas artistic creativity or creative technological invention). Studies\nhave focused on analyses of the personality traits that are conducive\nto creative thinking, and the social and environmental factors that\nare favorable for discovery\n (section 9.1). Two key elements of the\n cognitive processes involved in\ncreative thinking are analogies (section 9.2) and\nmental models (section 9.3). \n\nPsychological studies of creative individuals’ behavioral dispositions\nsuggest that creative scientists share certain personality traits,\nincluding confidence, openness, dominance, independence, introversion,\nas well as arrogance and hostility. (For overviews of recent studies\non personality traits of creative scientists, see Feist 1999, 2006:\nchapter 5). Social situatedness has also been explored as an important\nresource for creativity. In this perspective, the sociocultural\nstructures and practices in which individuals are embedded are\nconsidered crucial for the generation of creative ideas.  Both\napproaches suggest that creative individuals usually have outsider\nstatus—they are socially deviant and diverge from the\nmainstream. \nOutsider status is also a key feature of standpoint. According to\nstandpoint theorists, people with standpoint are politically aware and\npolitically engaged people outside the mainstream. Some standpoint\ntheorists suggest exploiting this similarity for creativity research.\nBecause people with standpoint have different experiences and access\nto different domains of expertise than most members of a culture, they\ncan draw on rich conceptual resources for creative\nthinking. Standpoint theory may thus be an important resource for the\ndevelopment of social and environmental approaches to the study of\ncreativity (Solomon 2007). \n\nMany philosophers of science highlight the role of analogy in the\ndevelopment of new knowledge, whereby analogy is understood as a\nprocess of bringing ideas that are well understood in one domain to\nbear on a new domain (Thagard 1984; Holyoak and Thagard 1996). An\nimportant source for philosophical thought about analogy is Mary\nHesse’s conception of models and analogies in theory construction and\ndevelopment. In this approach, analogies are similarities between\ndifferent domains. Hesse introduces the distinction between positive,\nnegative, and neutral analogies (Hesse 1966: 8). If we consider the\nrelation between gas molecules and a model for gas, namely a\ncollection of billiard balls in random motion, we will find properties\nthat are common to both domains (positive analogy) as well as\nproperties that can only be ascribed to the model but not to the\ntarget domain (negative analogy). There is a positive analogy between\ngas molecules and a collection of billiard balls because both the\nballs and the molecules move randomly. There is a negative analogy\nbetween the domains because billiard balls are colored, hard, and\nshiny but gas molecules do not have these properties. The most\ninteresting properties are those properties of the model about which\nwe do not know whether they are positive or negative analogies. This\nset of properties is the neutral analogy. These properties are the\nsignificant properties because they might lead to new insights about\nthe less familiar domain.  From our knowledge about the familiar\nbilliard balls, we may be able to derive new predictions about the\nbehavior of gas molecules, which we could then test. \nHesse offers a more detailed analysis of the structure of analogical\nreasoning through the distinction between horizontal and vertical\nanalogies between domains. Horizontal analogies between two domains\nconcern the sameness or similarity between properties of both domains.\nIf we consider sound and light waves, there are similarities between\nthem: sound echoes, light reflects; sound is loud, light is bright,\nboth sound and light are detectable by our senses. There are also\nrelations among the properties within one domain, such as the causal\nrelation between sound and the loud tone we hear and, analogously,\nbetween physical light and the bright light we see. These analogies\nare vertical analogies. For Hesse, vertical analogies hold the key for\nthe construction of new theories. \nAnalogies play several roles in science. Not only do they contribute\nto discovery but they also play a role in the development and\nevaluation of scientific theories. Current discussions about analogy\nand discovery have expanded and refined Hesse’s approach in various\nways. Some philosophers have developed criteria for evaluating analogy\narguments (Bartha 2010). Other work has identified highly significant\nanalogies that were particularly fruitful for the advancement of\nscience (Holyoak and Thagard 1996: 186–188; Thagard 1999:\nchapter 9). The majority of analysts explore the features of the\ncognitive mechanisms through which aspects of a familiar domain or\nsource are applied to an unknown target domain in order to understand\nwhat is unknown. According to the influential multi-constraint theory\nof analogical reasoning developed by Holyoak and Thagard, the transfer\nprocesses involved in analogical reasoning (scientific and otherwise)\nare guided or constrained in three main ways: 1) by the direct\nsimilarity between the elements involved; 2) by the structural\nparallels between source and target domain; as well as 3) by the\npurposes of the investigators, i.e., the reasons why the analogy is\nconsidered. Discovery, the formulation of a new hypothesis, is one\nsuch purpose. \n“In vivo” investigations of scientists reasoning in their\nlaboratories have not only shown that analogical reasoning is a key\ncomponent of scientific practice, but also that the distance between\nsource and target depends on the purpose for which analogies are\nsought. Scientists trying to fix experimental problems draw analogies\nbetween targets and sources from highly similar domains. In contrast,\nscientists attempting to formulate new models or concepts draw\nanalogies between less similar domains. Analogies between radically\ndifferent domains, however, are rare (Dunbar 1997, 2001). \n\nIn current cognitive science, human cognition is often explored in\nterms of model-based reasoning. The starting point of this approach is\nthe notion that much of human reasoning, including probabilistic and\ncausal reasoning as well as problem solving takes place through mental\nmodeling rather than through the application of logic or\nmethodological criteria to a set of propositions (Johnson-Laird 1983;\nMagnani et al.  1999; Magnani and Nersessian 2002). In model-based\nreasoning, the mind constructs a structural representation of a\nreal-world or imaginary situation and manipulates this structure. In\nthis perspective, conceptual structures are viewed as models and\nconceptual innovation as constructing new models through various\nmodeling operations. Analogical reasoning—analogical\nmodeling—is regarded as one of three main forms of model-based\nreasoning that appear to be relevant for conceptual innovation in\nscience. Besides analogical modeling, visual modeling and simulative\nmodeling or thought experiments also play key roles (Nersessian 1992,\n1999, 2009).  These modeling practices are constructive in that they\naid the development of novel mental models. The key elements of\nmodel-based reasoning are the call on knowledge of generative\nprinciples and constraints for physical models in a source domain and\nthe use of various forms of abstraction. Conceptual innovation results\nfrom the creation of new concepts through processes that abstract and\nintegrate source and target domains into new models (Nersessian\n2009). \nSome critics have argued that despite the large amount of work on the\ntopic, the notion of mental model is not sufficiently clear.  Thagard\nseeks to clarify the concept by characterizing mental models in terms\nof neural processes (Thagard 2010). In his approach, mental models are\nproduced through complex patterns of neural firing, whereby the\nneurons and the interconnections between them are dynamic and\nchanging. A pattern of firing neurons is a representation when there\nis a stable causal correlation between the pattern or activation and\nthe thing that is represented. In this research, questions about the\nnature of model-based reasoning are transformed into questions about\nthe brain mechanisms that produce mental representations. \n\nThe above sections show that the study of scientific discovery has\nbecome an integral part of the wider endeavor of exploring creative\nthinking and creativity more generally. Naturalistic philosophical\napproaches combine conceptual analysis of processes of knowledge\ngeneration with empirical work on creativity, drawing heavily and\nexplicitly on current research in psychology and cognitive science,\nand on in vivo laboratory observations, and, most recently,\non brain imaging techniques (Kounios and Beeman 2009, Thagard and Stewart 2011).","contact.mail":"jschicko@indiana.edu","contact.domain":"indiana.edu"}]
