Its best-known\nrepresentatives—philosophers of the like of Thomas Hill Green and\nFrancis Herbert Bradley—held a version of Absolute idealism, the\ntheory that reality is a single unified consciousness or cosmic\nexperience. The doctrine has its roots in the philosophies of Spinoza,\nKant and Hegel, but the British idealists elaborated it in independent,\noriginal ways. In this, they were motivated by a desire to oppose\nmaterialism and vindicate our instinctive belief that human life has a\nmeaning. As Bradley forcefully put it in his Logic,\n“that the glory of this world in the end is appearance leaves the\nworld more glorious, if we feel it is a show of some fuller splendor;\nbut the sensuous curtain is a deception and a cheat, if it hides some\ncolourless movement of atoms […]” (Bradley 1883: 590).\n\n\n\nIt is easy to see, however, how Absolute idealism threatens those very\nideals it is supposed to defend, since it denies that finite existence\nis truly real and downgrades it to ‘a show of some fuller\nsplendor.’ If reality is a single unified totality, what is the\nindividual self? If the past, the present and the future are not real\nfor the Absolute, wherein lays our freedom? If reality is eternally\nperfect, what is the point of our moral struggles? The philosophy of\nthe Cambridge Professor James Ward (1843–1925)—now a\nlargely forgotten figure but once a very respected thinker—is an\nattempt at overcoming these difficulties by combining the idealistic\nstandpoint with a pluralistic metaphysics.\n\n\n\nJames Ward was born in Hull, Yorkshire, on 27th January 1843, as a\nson of James Ward, senior, a merchant with some scientific and\nphilosophical ambition (in a book entitled God, Man and the\nBible, he tried to give a scientific explanation of the Flood).\nHis father's enterprises were disastrous, however, so that lack\nof resources was to be a constant source of anxiety for the family,\nwhich included an uneducated, hard-working, deeply religious mother,\nsix sisters and a brother (another son died). \n\nAfter one of his father's bankruptcies, Ward remained for two\nyears without schooling and occupation. At the age of thirteen and a\nhalf, the boy was let free to occupy his time as he wished. In the\nsmall country town where his family had moved, Waterloo near Liverpool,\nhe developed a spirit of solitude and a love of nature. A\n‘Memoir’ written by the philosopher's daughter, Olwen\nWard Campbell, enables us to get a glimpse of his life in these early\nyears: “Waterloo was only a village in those days, and wild\nstretches of sandhills lay beyond it for many miles. Here he used to\nwander for hours on end, alone with his thoughts and the sea\nbirds” (1927: 7). \n\nIn addition to the family's economic difficulties,\nWard's youth was shaped by the narrow Calvinistic faith in which\nhe was raised. In 1863 he entered Spring Hill College (later\nincorporated in Mansfield College, Oxford) with the aim of becoming a\nminister, but became increasingly skeptical of the doctrines he was\nexpected to preach. In the middle of his religious crisis, Ward moved\nto Germany for a temporary period of study. In Göttingen, he\nattended lectures by one of the most influential philosophers of the\ntime, Rudolf Hermann Lotze. It is probably from Lotze that Ward gained\na first substantial appreciation of the philosophy of Leibniz, whose\ntheory of monads was later to provide the basis of his own\nmetaphysics. \n\nUpon returning to England, Ward made a sincere yet vain attempt to\nretain his faith and accepted a pastorate in Cambridge. His spiritual\ncrisis reached its climax and the point of no return in 1872, when he\ndefinitively abandoned the project of becoming a minister and applied\nas a non-collegiate student at Cambridge. One year later, he won a\nscholarship in Moral Science at Trinity College. \n\nImportant lessons were learned in the anguish of these vicissitudes\nand deliberations. In a letter to a friend, Ward writes: “I am\ncoming to see more clearly every day that man is only half free, or\nrather that his freedom is not what I once thought it. It is not the\npower to choose anything, but only the power to choose between\nalternatives offered, and what these shall be circumstances determine\nquite as will” (59). Surely, this insight owes more to the\nstruggle of existence than to abstract speculation. Interestingly,\nWard's mature philosophy comprises a defense of human freedom and\nsustains the idea that—independently of circumstances outside of\nour control—we always retain a capacity for responsible\naction. \n\nWard made the best out of the difficult challenge of beginning a new\nlife at the age of thirty. In 1874 he obtained a first in his Tripos;\none year later, he won a fellowship with a dissertation entitled\n‘The Relation of Physiology to Psychology,’ part of which\nwas published in the first issue of Mind in 1876. These\nsuccesses marked the beginning of a distinguished career. He first\nbecame known for his article on ‘Psychology’ (1886) in the\nEncyclopaedia Britannica, in which he criticised Mill and\nBain's associationism, and in the years 1896–98 he delivered the\nprestigious Gifford Lectures, later published under the title\nNaturalism and Agnosticism (1899). In this book, Ward attacked\nthe various forms of scientific materialism that were current in the\nsecond half of the nineteenth century. The lectures were well received\nby his contemporaries and there was a widespread agreement that Ward\nhad been effective in his refutation. According to Alfred Edward\nTaylor, who reviewed the book in Mind in 1900, “one may\nassert without much fear of contradiction that Prof. Ward's\nGifford Lectures are the philosophical book of the last year”\n(Taylor 1900: 244). \n\nG. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell were among Ward's students at\nCambridge, where he had been elected to the new Chair of Mental\nPhilosophy and Logic in 1897. Moore has left a vivid testimony of his\npersonality and teaching style; as he recalls, \n\nMoore describes Ward as a melancholy personality, overwhelmed by the\ndifficulties of philosophical thinking—‘Das Denken ist\nschwer’ was one of his favorite sayings. (16) And while\nMoore was also impressed by Ward's ‘extreme sincerity and\nconscientiousness’ (18), Russell singles him out as one for whom\nhe had a ‘great personal affection’ (Russell 1946: 10). \n\nWard's reputation as a philosopher must have been very high, for he\nwas invited to deliver a second series of Gifford Lectures.  These\nwere held in the years 1907–1910 and published in 1911\nas The Realm of Ends or Pluralism and Theism; it is in this\nbook that he provides the most complete exposition of his idealistic\nmetaphysics. \n\nWard reached his metaphysics—a theory of interacting\nmonads—by way of criticism of the two main philosophical\ntendencies of his day, scientific materialism and\n‘absolute’ (or ‘monistic’) idealism. The\ncritique of materialism is developed at considerable length in the\nfirst series of Gifford Lectures, Naturalism and Agnosticism.\nWard observes here that the view of reality as a system of inert\nmaterial particles subject to strict deterministic laws cannot explain\nthe world's contingency, a fundamental aspect of experienced\nreality that needs to be taken at face value. Moreover, materialism\nfails to provide an adequate ontology for biology, for it cannot\nexplain the emergence of life from lifeless matter. The doctrine is\nalso inconsistent with the latest development of physics, which is\nmoving away from the seventeenth-century, Democritean conception of the\natom as an inert particle—a microscopic, indivisible\n‘thing.’ \n\nWard's overall conclusion is that materialism is so beset with\ndifficulties that the real question is not whether it is true, but why\nit has come to be believed in the first place. Ward traces the origin\nof this doctrine in a tendency to confound abstractions with concrete\nrealities. At the beginning of inquiry, the scientist is faced with a\nconcrete whole of experience, but takes notice only of some aspects of\nit. This is wholly justified, but errors are likely to be committed if\nhe overlooks the richness of the empirical basis from which his notions\nare derived. He is then apt to “confound his descriptive\napparatus with the actual phenomena it is devised to describe”\n(1899: Vol. 1, 81). Materialism is the metaphysics of the scientist\nlacking understanding of his own procedure. \n\nThese reflections led Ward to the idealistic conclusion that reality\nmust be interpreted ‘in terms of Mind.’ Absolute\nidealism—the then widespread view that reality is a cosmic\nconsciousness or single ‘Experience’—will not do, for\nWard regards it as explanatorily vacuous. The theory that the world of\nfinite things is but the ‘appearance’ of the One does\nnothing to make the nature of the world more intelligible. Why does the\nOne appear in the way it does? And why does it have to appear at all?\nThese questions find no answer in the works of great monistic thinkers\nsuch as Spinoza and Hegel, nor do their British followers do any better\nin this respect. Ward substantiates this claim with a quotation from\nBradley's Appearance and Reality (1893), where he admits\nthat the ‘fact of fragmentariness,’ that is, why the One\nappears in the form of a multiplicity, cannot be explained. \n\nThe upshot of these two parallel lines of arguments—the\ncritique of materialism and Absolute idealism—is that some form\nof pluralistic idealism must be true. And it is only natural at this\npoint to turn to Leibniz, and especially so for a thinker so well\nacquainted with German philosophy. According to Ward, however,\nLeibniz's metaphysics needs to be amended in one fundamental\nrespect: \n\nWard's main crux is that pre-established harmony fails to\nleave any room open for contingency and genuine novelties. In\nLeibniz's system, evolution can only be interpreted as\n‘preformation,’ the gradual unfolding of what in a\ncompressed form is already present at the beginning. This is\ninconsistent with a correct understanding of evolution, which involves\n‘epigenesis’—the coming into being of unexpected\nfacts. \n\nInterestingly, the same criticism is advanced against philosophies\nsuch as Hegel's that conceives of natural history as the\n‘externalization’ of a primordial ‘Idea.’ Ward\nnotices, however, that Hegel's description of nature—as\n‘a bacchantic God’ (148), and as providing ‘the\nspectacle of a contingency that runs out into endless detail’\n(139)—is insightful and wholly in line with his own; indeed, he\ngoes so far as to say that ‘there is a strong undercurrent of\n[Leibnizian] pluralism running through the whole of Hegel's\nphilosophy.’ (159) \n\nPart of Leibniz's motivation for holding to pre-established\nharmony was the alleged impossibility of making sense of\ntranseunt causation—that is, causation understood as a\ndirect relation between distinct monads (as opposed to\nimmanent causation, which holds between successive stages of a\nmonad's life). If direct interaction is impossible, how to\naccount for the correlations between things except by assuming that it\nhad been established by a supreme Architect? In the hands of Leibniz,\nthis surprising view as to the nature of causation becomes the\nfoundation of an original proof of God's existence. \n\nWard attacks Leibniz's reasoning at its very basis. Causal\ninteraction was understood by Leibniz in terms of the doctrine of\nphysical influx. On that model, direct causal interaction is\nrejected because properties cannot exist unless as inhering in\nsubstances; in passing from one substance to another, however, the\ncommunicated property would have to exist in a detached condition,\nwhich seems absurd. Could this simple piece of reasoning suffice to\nreject what we seem to experience all the time, namely our power to act\ndirectly upon external realities and to be immediately affected by\nthem? In his answer to Leibniz, Ward remarks that the theory of\nphysical influx categorizes the terms of a causal relation as\nsubstances to which qualities inhere; on this theory, even the monads\nare therefore conceived as if they were things. This involves a special\nsort of category-mistake: ‘Monads’—Ward\nsays—“are conative, that is are feeling and striving\nsubjects or persons in the widest sense, not inert particles or\nthings” (260). \n\nIn other words, since monads are not ‘things’ but\n‘subjects,’ the argument against direct monadic\ninteraction is blatantly invalid. As Ward puts it: “If the\nLeibnizian assumption, that there are no beings devoid of perception\nand spontaneity… is otherwise sound, then the objections to\ntranseunt action between things become irrelevant” (219). Hence,\nin a polemical reversion of Leibniz's famous metaphor, he concludes\nthat ‘all monads have windows’ (260). \n\nIf pre-established harmony fails to account for the world's\ncontingency, it must be asked whether Ward's theory of\ninteracting monads can explain nature's order and regularity. The\nelement of contingency that pervades the world is immediately accounted\nfor by the assumption that the ultimate constituents of reality are\n‘living’ subjects, but how do orderly processes emerge?\nWard formulates this question as follows: “Can we conceive such\nan interaction of spontaneous agents…, taking on the appearance\nof mechanism?” (1927: 239). \n\nThe solution consists in interpreting nature after a social analogy.\nThe following thought-experiment illustrates the idea: “Let us\nimagine a great multitude of human beings, varying in tastes and\nendowments as widely as human beings are known to do, and let us\nsuppose this multitude suddenly to find themselves, as Adam and Eve\ndid, in an ample Paradise enriched sufficiently with diverse natural\nresources to make the attainment of high civilization possible”\n(1911: 54). It is obvious to Ward that such individuals would\ngradually achieve a hierarchical, specialized form of social\norganization. To a hypothetical external observer, the initial phases\nof the new life of the selected individuals will appear utterly\nchaotic, but in due course order and regularity would emerge:\n“…in place of an incoherent multitude, all seemingly\nacting at random, we should have a social and economic organization,\nevery member of which had his appropriate place and function”\n(55–56). \n\nIt is after this fashion that nature should be understood. Consider\nan apparently inert object such as a piece of rock. This is not an\naggregate of material atoms, but a society of active subjects. Starting\nout from a state of mutual isolation, Ward speculates, a plurality of\nmonads might end up finding a satisfactory modus vivendi.\nThese monads might then continue to stick together—either because\nthey are unwilling to break out of the social structures in which they\nare embedded, or because they have become unable to do so. To clarify\nthis concept, Ward appeals to an ingenious simile: \n\nThus, monads might get imprisoned within a form of life in the same\nway in which persons might get imprisoned in their habits. While the\nmore energetic monads will try to escape routine, other will acquiesce\nin it. It is the passivity and repetitiveness of the monad's\nbehavior that generates ‘the appearance of mechanism.’ \n\nIn spite of the rejection of pre-established harmony, this\nconception still owes much to Leibniz's teaching. On Ward's\nview, the physical objects apprehended in ordinary experience are the\nappearance to us of a structured conglomerate, or societal whole, of\nliving subjects (1927: 239). Such appearances are not illusions. Our\nimmediate sensations fail to reproduce the object's real internal\nconstitution, yet they do point toward realities actually existing\nindependently of the perceiving subject. Ward's metaphysical\nidealism thus comes with a form of epistemological realism, while his\nconception of every-day physical objects is virtually identical with\nLeibniz's notion of phenomena bene fundata.\nStated in Kantian terminology, physical objects are the appearances to\nus of things whose noumenal being or intrinsic nature is\nmental or experiential. According to Ward (1911: 392), Kant too was\nforcefully drawn to this position, even in his critical phase and in\nspite of his notorious claim that noumena lie outside the\ncategories of the understanding and sensible intuition. \n\nWard's social account of the natural world provides the\nfoundation for an original account of natural laws that he conceived of\nas statistical, evolved and transient. In\nthe first place, in a universe that is ultimately social, natural laws\nmust be of the like of economic or anthropological laws; as such, they\nhold for groups of monads rather than for individual ones and are\nstatistical generalizations rather than eternally fixed decrees.\nSecondly, natural laws are to be regarded as the products of evolution\nbecause they record the habitual behavior of groups of socialized\nmonads, and habits have to be acquired or ‘learned’ over\ntime. Thirdly, it is a historical platitude that societies emerge and\ndecay. Since the natural laws dominating a given epoch depend upon that\nepoch's social order, natural laws cannot be regarded as\nimmutable; like all finite realities, they too are likely to change in\nthe course of cosmic history. \n\nAnother notable Cambridge thinker and Leibnizian scholar, Charles\nDunbar Broad, nicely summarized Ward's conception with the\nfollowing words: \n\nWard's account might be profitably compared with a similar one\nprovided by Charles Sanders Peirce in his important essay of 1891,\n‘The Architecture of Theories.’ Here, Peirce advocates the\nview that “the only intelligible theory of the universe is that\nof objective idealism, that matter is effete mind, inveterate habits\nbecoming physical laws” (153). Furthermore, he contends that\n“the only possible way of accounting for the laws of nature and\nfor uniformity in general is to suppose them results of evolution. This\nsupposes them not to be absolute, not to be obeyed precisely. It makes\nan element of indeterminacy, spontaneity, or absolute chance in\nnature” (148). \n\nDespite the analogies, a major point of controversy is represented\nby Peirce's tychism—the doctrine hinted at in the\njust quoted passage that ‘absolute chance’ (tyche)\nis of the essence of the universe. The disagreement is not as to\nwhether there is a level of reality that escapes external\ndetermination—a striking anticipation of Heisenberg's\nindeterminacy principle that both Peirce and Ward endorse. The question\nis as to how that most fundamental level is to be understood. In a\npassage that can only be interpreted as a reply to Peirce, Ward\nwrites: \n\nThis critique rests upon the argument that—since monads are\n‘subjects’ in the full sense of the term—they cannot\nact at random; specifically, monads act either in order to secure\nself-preservation or to achieve self-realization. This doctrine is\nphenomenologically well-grounded. Our own psychic life provides us with\nan immediate grasp of the inner life of a monadic creature, and it is\nclear to Ward that we do experience ourselves as motivated in this\nway. \n\nIn sum, for Ward it is the ‘teleological’ that grounds\nthe ‘mechanical.’ A monad always aims at self-preservation\nand self-realization; this is the simplest way in which the\nmonad's conatus—or will to live—manifests\nitself. At the same time, self-preservation and self-realization are\ntwo fundamental metaphysical parameters, the defining features of each\nmonad's ‘character.’ If the need for\nself-preservation predominates, the monad will acquiesce in its\nacquired status. These are Broad's ‘stupid minds’ and\nrepresents the conservative elements in nature. Per contra,\n‘intelligent’ monads actively seek self-realization. Their\nimportance in the cosmic scheme cannot be underestimated; eventually,\nit is their craving for novelties that powers evolution and prevents\nhistory from coming to a halt. \n\nWard's theory of monads is a radical form of panpsychism; on\nthis view, experience is not solely ubiquitous—it is all there\ntruly his. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, the debate on\npanpsychism was launched by the publication in 1878 of William Kingdon\nClifford's ‘On the Nature of Things-in-Themselves.’\nThis essay was perfectly attuned to the Zeitgeist, since it\nlinked panpsychism with evolutionary theory. Clifford appeals to the\nnon-emerge argument: the transition from inert matter to conscious\nbeings would be unintelligible, a kind of unfathomable creatio ex\nnihilo; hence, we are forced to conclude that\n‘experience’ is an intrinsic, aboriginal feature of\nmatter. \n\nWard apparently agrees with the general drift of this argument. In\nan essay significantly entitled ‘Mechanism and Morals,’ he\nexplains that one need not fear the theory of evolution; this does not\ndegrade either consciousness or human life, but leads to a\nspiritualized view of matter: \n\nWard's endorsement of Clifford's evolutionary argument,\nhowever, points towards a tension in his philosophy. If evolution means\n‘epigenesis’—the coming into being of what was not\npotentially present at the beginning—it is not clear why Ward\nshould be worried by the generation of mind out of matter. Conscious\nexistence might well be one of the novelties evolution is capable of\nproducing. \n\nWard does, at any rate, vehemently reject Clifford's specific\nversion of panpsychism. Clifford speculated that each atom of matter\nwas associated with a quantum of experience, a small piece of\n‘mind-stuff.’ This piece of ‘mind-stuff’ was\nconceived as an atom of experience, amounting to something less than a\ncomplete thought or feeling. Clifford also held that thoughts and\nfeelings could be constituted simply by way of combination. “When\nmolecules are so combined as to form the brain and nervous system of a\nvertebrate,” he wrote, “the corresponding\nelements of mind-stuff are so combined as to form some kind of\nconsciousness.” Analogously, “when matter takes the complex\nform of a living human brain, the corresponding mind-stuff takes the\nform of a human consciousness, having intelligence and volition”\n(65). In this way, Clifford believed, it would be possible to explain\nwhy the genesis of complex material structures in the course of\nevolution is accompanied by the parallel emergence of higher forms of\nsentience and mental activity. \n\nThe theory is best regarded as a form of psycho-physical\nparallelism; this is, at all events, how Ward interprets it in\nNaturalism and Agnosticism, just before subjecting\n‘Clifford's wild speculations concerning mind-stuff’\n(1899: Vol. 2, 12) to a devastating critique. \n\nWard's criticizes Clifford's theory on three main\naccounts. (1) In the first place, the whole theory presupposes a\npoint-to-point correspondence between matter and mind. Clifford's\nconception of an atom, however, is obsolete: ‘if the speculations\nof Lord Kelvin and others are to be accepted, and the prime atom itself\nis a state of motion in a primitive homogeneous medium [the ether],\nwhat is the mental equivalent of this primordial medium?’ (114)\nIn other words, Clifford's theory couples material atoms with\nsimple ideas. But if the atom is not a simple particle but a state of\nan underlying substance, it is not so easy to see what precisely in our\nconsciousness could correspond to it. \n\n(2) Secondly, Clifford's views—‘a maze of\npsychological barbarism’ (15)—totally misrepresent the\nnature of human consciousness. It is inconceivable how there could be\nexperiences apart from subjects of experiences or larger wholes of\nconsciousness, such as the smallest pieces of mind-dust will have to\nbe: “Nobody bent on psychological precision would speak of ideas\nas either conscious or intelligent, but still less would he speak of\nideas existing in isolation apart from, and prior to, a consciousness\nand intelligence” (15–16). Clifford fails to recognize the\nfundamental psychological fact of the unity of consciousness; the\npsychical field is not made up of simple sensations in the way in which\na mosaic-picture is made up of little stones. \n\n(3) Lastly, the mind-dust theory faces its own problem of emergence.\nWhy should the transition from inert matter to consciousness be\nregarded as more mysterious than the transition from little pieces of\nconsciousness to the single, unified consciousness of a human being?\n“Allowing that it [mind-dust] is not mind, he [Clifford] makes no\nattempt to show how from such dust a living mind could ever\nspring” (15). Thus, Clifford's theory has no explanatory\nadvantage over competitor accounts of the mind-body relation; there is\nstill a ‘gap’ that needs to be closed. \n\nOne easily sees that Ward's theory of monads does not face any\nof these difficulties. (1) The correlation between the psychical and\nthe physical is not a one-to-one correspondence between discrete\nphysical atoms and discrete psychical atoms, but is explained in terms\nof a Leibnizian theory of ‘confused perception.’ (2) There\nare no ‘subjectless’ experiences, but all experienced\ncontents are ‘owned’ by the monads, each of which is a\ngenuine unity containing distinct perceptual\ncontents—Leibniz's ‘petites\nperceptions’ (1911: 256), but is not literally\n‘made up’ by them. The relationship between the mind and\nthe monads in the body, Ward also remarks in this connection (196), is\nnot that of a whole to its parts but that of a dominant to its\nsubordinate monads. (3) And lastly, there are no mysterious transitions\nin Ward's theory. The growth of the mind—from the inchoate\nexperiences of infants to the relatively sophisticated experiences of\nadult human beings—shows that ‘lower’ states are\nsuperseded by ‘higher’ ones thanks to intersubjective,\nsocial intercourse. \n\nHence, Ward sums up his discussion by claiming the superiority of a\nLeibnizian approach over Clifford's mind-stuff theory: \n\nNevertheless, Ward's theory does leave several questions open.\nIn the first place, if our conscious apprehension of the external world\nis mediated by our direct apprehension of the monads constituting the\nbody and more specifically the brain—as Ward contends (1911:\n257–258)—why are we not aware of our neurons? Secondly,\nWard's theory escapes the composition-problem, but this is now\nreplaced by the problem of monadic interaction. How does the dominant\nmonad influence the lower ones and rule over them? Thirdly, there is a\nquestion as to the nature of space. Granted that direct monadic\ninteraction is real, where does it occur? Interaction would seem to\nrequire a common dimension or medium in order to be possible at all;\nwhat kind of dimension could host spiritual beings such as the monads\nare supposed to be? \n\nDisappointingly enough, on all these crucial issues Ward has nothing\nto say. In the absence of a satisfactory treatment of these topics,\nhowever, his theory becomes intrinsically unstable, as further\nreflection might show that the positions just reached will have to be\nabandoned. \n\nAs in the rest of his philosophy, evolutionary theory also looms large\nin Ward's natural theology. The existence of God, Ward frankly\nrecognizes, cannot be proved. However, a theory of interacting monads\ncannot guarantee that the universe will keep moving towards a state of\nincreasing harmony and cohesion: “without such a spiritual\ncontinuity as theism alone seems able to ensure,” Ward remarks,\n“it looks as if a pluralistic world were condemned to a\nSisyphean task” (215). At the same time, the worldly monads need\nthe leadership of a supreme agent if harmony has to be widespread\nacross the entire universe.  Accordingly, Ward's main problem is to\nunderstand how God can be related to the world of monads and guide\nthem towards the realization of societies of ever increasing\nperfections. \n\nIt is clear to Ward that there must be an ontological gap between\nGod and the monads. God cannot be a primus inter\npares—only a monad among other monads (as Leibniz's\nlanguage sometimes suggests). Since God is the world's ratio\nessendi—its ontological foundation, rather than its creator\nin time—He must be regarded as altogether transcendent. At the\nsame time, since God has to lure the evolutionary process, He cannot\nmerely maintain the world in existence, but must somehow actively enter\ninto it; His relation to the world must therefore involve an aspect of\nimmanence. This gives rise to a dilemma: how could God be both immanent\nand transcendent? Ward can do no better than to provide an analogy in\nwhich God is compared with a Cosmic Artist: \n\nNeedless to say, this analogy is too ‘faint and distant’\nto be of any real help. \n\nWard strikes an original note in his attempt to accommodate the\nreality of God with epigenesis. Since he believes that novelties could\nonly be generated by the interplay of genuinely free agents, he\nconceives of God as limiting himself in the exercise of his power, so\nas to let the monads free: “Unless creators are created,”\nhe says, “nothing is really created” (437). Having\nrenounced omnipotence, God cannot have knowledge of a future he does\nnot control anymore. This means that the notion of divine\nomniscience—which in the case of Leibniz takes the form of the\ndoctrine of complete concepts—must be abandoned.  God lacks\nknowledge of future contingents; nevertheless, he is aware of all the\npossibilities open to a monad at any moment, so that the future will\nnever come to him as unexpected: “God, who knows both tendencies\nand possibilities completely, is beyond surprise and his purpose\nbeyond frustration” (479). Clearly, such a God cannot be the\nperfect, immutable God of Leibniz and of classical theism, but is a\ndeveloping God whose knowledge of the world increases with the\nunfolding of cosmic history. How does such a God lure the world\ntowards greater perfection? This question too is left unanswered;\nalways candid, Ward acknowledges that God's “modus\noperandi…is to us inscrutable” (479). \n\nWard's metaphysics has had very little impact upon later\nAnglo-American philosophy, but it was not without influence in the\nCambridge philosophical world in the first two or three decades of the\ntwentieth century. Bertrand Russell explicitly recognizes his\nindebtedness to his teacher in his scholarly study of 1900, A\nCritical Examination of the Philosophy of Leibniz. Although he\ncomplained that Ward's philosophy was ‘dull and\nantiquate’ in a letter to Ottoline Morrell (Griffin 1991: 39), it\nis arguable that the influence run deeper, as Russell cultivated an\ninterest in those questions at the verge between natural philosophy,\nphilosophy of mind and metaphysics that so much mattered to Ward. This\nbecomes clear as soon as one considers that he is not solely the\ncelebrated author of ‘On Denoting’ (1905) and The\nPrinciples of Mathematics (1903), but also of The Analysis of\nMind (1921) and The Analysis of Matter (1927). \n\nOther Cambridge thinkers that might have been influenced by Ward are\nJohn Ellis McTaggart, C. D. Broad, and Alfred North Whitehead. In\nThe Nature of Existence (1921/1927) McTaggart developed a\nsystem of idealistic metaphysics that bears some resemblance with\nLeibniz's theory of monads. Broad says in his\n‘Autobiography’ (1959) that his idealist professor had\n‘little influence’ on his thought (50), yet he favorably\n(and acutely) reviewed Ward's The Realm of Ends and\ndevoted an important study to Leibniz's philosophy. Arguably, the\ngreatest ascertained influence was exerted on Alfred North Whitehead;\nthe system of metaphysics that he exposed in Process and\nReality (1929) incorporates all the crucial ideas of Ward's\nphilosophy of nature, while his conception of the God-World\nrelationship is a way of bringing to completion Ward's\nfragmentary account. (Basile 2009: 61–62, 142–43) One might reasonably\nexpect that, outside of Cambridge, his philosophy should have been\ntaken into serious consideration by thinkers with an interest in\nNaturphilosophie, and especially so by a philosopher usually\nreferred to as an ‘idealist’ such as Robin G. Collingwood,\nbut there seems to be no documentary evidence of this. American process\nphilosopher and theologian Charles Hartshorne, whose speculative system\napproximates to Whitehead's, displays in print knowledge of\nWard's works. (1963: 19) \n\nWard's philosophy is little known today and scholarly discussions of\nhis thought are scanty. In the widely read A Hundred Years of\nPhilosophy, John Passmore compares it unfavourably with\nMcTaggart's: “In McTaggart's case, the difficulty is to give a\nsummary account of a highly intricate pattern of argument; in Ward's\ncase, to decide what he really meant to say on the issues of central\nphilosophical importance” (82). In an age in love with logical\ntechnicalities, this is like putting a heavy stone on the\nphilosopher's grave. \n\nPassmore's judgment is not entirely justified; the essentials\nof Ward's philosophical credo are clear enough. The\nreasons for the oblivion in which his thought has fallen are historical\nand have much to do with a general shift of philosophical concerns, as\nhe belonged to a philosophical world that was swept away as a\nwhole by the mounting tide of linguistic philosophy—a world\nin which other towering figures were, just to mention a few names,\nforgotten but truly exceptional personalities like Francis Herbert\nBradley, Bernard Bosanquet, Samuel Alexander, and George Santayana. It\nis not a sheer accident that Ward's chair was inherited by Moore, and\nthen by Wittgenstein. Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to regard his\nphilosophy as little more than a relic from the past. The question\nconcerning the mind's place in nature is still at very centre of\nphilosophical debate; panpsychism has been recently recognized as a\nhypothesis worth contemplating by acclaimed philosophers such as Nagel\n(1979) and Chalmers (1996); more surprisingly perhaps, the idea that\nthe riddle of the universe might be solved by a theory of interacting\nmonads has resurfaced in recent ‘revisionary’ work by Galen\nStrawson (2006: 274). \n\nAt a deeper level, Ward's thought is admirable for his sincere\nattachment to the ideal of philosophical speculation as a non-dogmatic\nsource of orientation. His belief in the creative powers and\n‘freedom’ of the monad—which he defended from\nPeircian tychism, scientistic determinism and traditional\ntheism—implicitly grounds an ethics of responsibility, while his\nevolutionary theism (a form of meliorism, rather than of\noptimism) inspires a confident yet not naive attitude towards\nlife and its challenges. Surely, Ward's own\nvicissitudes—from debilitating poverty to public recognition as\nCambridge Professor of Mental Philosophy—are reflected in his\ngrand vision of reality as comprising an indefinite number of conative\nsubjects obstinately striving to achieve self-realization and social\nharmonization; in this only sustained, as he was wont to say, by\n‘faith in light to come’ (1927: 66).","contact.mail":"pierfrancesco.basile@philo.unibe.ch","contact.domain":"philo.unibe.ch"}]
