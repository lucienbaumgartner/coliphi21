This\ntechnical concept in the philosophy of language has critical\nconsequences felt throughout philosophy. In their fullest generality,\nthe consequences are metaphysical and epistemological. Whether a\nstatement's designators are rigid or non-rigid may determine whether\nit is necessarily true, necessarily false, or contingent. This\nmetaphysical status is sometimes out of accord with what one would\nexpect given a statement's apparent epistemological status as a\nposteriori or a priori. Statements affected include central ones under\ninvestigation in philosophical subdisciplines from the philosophy of\nscience to mind to ethics and aesthetics. Hence, much of the\ndiscussion in various subdisciplines of philosophy is explicitly or\nimplicitly framed around the distinction between rigid and non-rigid\ndesignators.\n\nPhilosophical work performed by rigidity is discussed in\n §3\n below, after a more thorough characterization of the notion of\nrigidity is provided. However, a modicum of understanding about that\nwork is needed for any understanding of what is interesting about\nrigid designators. Hence, before moving on to refinements in\ncharacterizing the notion of rigidity, consider a famous application\nmade by Saul Kripke, who coined the word ‘rigid\ndesignator’. Kripke is not the first philosopher to discuss the\nidea behind the term he\n coined,[1]\n but his illuminating discussions have made the importance of rigidity\nwidely appreciated. \nKripke (1980;1971) famously argues that because a rigid designator\ndesignates the same object in all possible worlds, an identity\nstatement in which both designators are rigid must be necessarily true\nif it is true at all, even if the statement is not a priori. His\nclassic example is the identity statement ‘Hesperus is identical\nwith Phosphorus’, which is true, but which was discovered a\nposteriori to be true. (Let us understand a “statement” to\nbe a sentence under an interpretation; and, following Kripke’s\nnotation in 1971 and elsewhere, let us shorten ‘Hesperus is\nidentical with Phosphorus’ to ‘Hesperus =\nPhosphorus’ even though Kripke does not do that in 1980.)\n‘Hesperus’ is a name that was given to a heavenly body\nseen in the evening, and ‘Phosphorus’ is a name that was,\nunknown to the first users of the name, given to that same heavenly\nbody seen in the morning. The heavenly body is Venus. \nOne might initially suppose that since the statement ‘Hesperus =\nPhosphorus’ was only discovered empirically to be true, it must\nbe contingently true. But, says Kripke, it is necessarily true. The\nonly respect in which it might have turned out false is not\nmetaphysical but epistemic: thus, one could as well say of a\ngeometrical theorem before it is proven that it might or might not\nturn out to be true or that it might or might not be provable without\nthe parallels postulate. But if it is true and is provable without the\nparallels postulate, that is a matter of metaphysical necessity. In\nthe same way, if the statement ‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’ is\ntrue, that is a matter of metaphysical necessity. \n‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’ is necessarily true if true at all\nbecause ‘Hesperus’ and ‘Phosphorus’ are proper\nnames for the same object. Like other names, Kripke maintains, they\nare rigid: each designates just the object it actually\ndesignates in all possible worlds in which that object exists, and it\ndesignates nothing else in any possible world. The object that\n‘Hesperus’ and ‘Phosphorus’ name in all\npossible worlds is Venus. Since ‘Hesperus’ and\n‘Phosphorus’ both name Venus in all possible worlds, and\nsince Venus = Venus in all possible worlds, ‘Hesperus =\nPhosphorus’ is true in all possible worlds. \nA description like ‘the brightest non-lunar object in the\nevening sky’ is, on the other hand, not rigid. That\nexplains why the identity statement \nis true but not necessarily true. While Hesperus is in fact\nthe brightest object in the evening sky apart from the moon, Hesperus\nmight have been dimmer: had, say, Hesperus been obscured by cosmic\ndust, Mars might have been the object designated by ‘the\nbrightest non-lunar object in the evening sky’ rather than\nHesperus. In that case, the above identity statement (H) would have\nbeen false. So the reason that (H) could have been false is that\n‘the brightest non-lunar object in the evening sky’ does\nnot designate Hesperus rigidly. It designates Hesperus in this world,\nwhich explains why (H) is true, but this description designates Mars\nin some other worlds, which explains why (H) could have been false:\n(H) would have been false had some other such world been actual. \nSome potential misunderstandings are well known. \nFirst, a rigid designator is used in a certain way in the actual world.  Given that meaning, it designates the same object with respect to all possible worlds, regardless of how this term is used, or not used, in those other possible worlds: for\nalthough we identify objects in other worlds by our own names, natives\nof some of these worlds use other names (Kripke 1980, p. 77). A few\nphilosophers resist this clarification. They find the idea of\ndifferentiating between the reference of terms in our world with\nrespect to other worlds, on the one hand, and the reference of terms\nas used in other worlds, on the other hand, fatally confused (for\ncritical discussion, see Fitch 2004, pp. 103–4). But such\nobjections are not popular. \nSecond, although the statement (H) is not necessarily true, it is\nnevertheless Kripke's view and the standard view that the object that\nis in fact the brightest in the evening sky, Venus (Hesperus),\nis necessarily identical to Hesperus. \nThird and finally, ‘Hesperus’ is rigid because it picks\nout Hesperus in all worlds that contain Hesperus. In worlds\nnot containing Hesperus, the designator fails to name anything other\nthan Hesperus. There is more than one account of a rigid designator\nthat conforms to that requirement. On one such account, a rigid\ndesignator designates its designatum in every possible world\ncontaining the designatum and in other possible worlds the designator\nfails to designate. In places, Kripke suggests that this is his\nidea: \nIn other places, Kripke seems to have in mind another account of\nrigidity: one according to which a rigid designator designates its\nobject in every possible world, whether or not the\ndesignatum exists in that world. Hence, he says, “If you say,\n‘suppose Hitler had never been born’ then\n‘Hitler’ refers here, still rigidly, to something that\nwould not exist in the counterfactual situation described”\n(Kripke 1980, p. 78). \nIt may be that no substantive issues ride on which conception of\nrigidity is adopted (Stanley 1997a, pp. 557, 566ff.; see also Brock\n2004, p. 285n.13). On the other hand, some philosophers have held that\ntrue statements using a proper name to express that so and so\nmight not have existed are unintelligible unless the relevant\nname refers to the object in all worlds, period. That might provide a\nsubstantive reason for favoring the latter type of rigidity,\nobstinate rigidity, as Salmon calls it (1981, p. 34).\nObstinate rigidity has sometimes been favored on grounds like these\n(see, e.g., Besson 2009; Gómez-Torrente 2006, p. 250; Plantinga\n1985, p. 84: particularities of Plantinga's characteristically\ninteresting account are discussed in the supplement on individual\nessences in the entry on\n actualism).\n Kripke's quote above hints that obstinate rigidity might afford this\nkind of advantage. But Kripke never argues for one position or\nanother. Despite occasional slips in favor of one or another refined\nversion of rigidity, he deliberately sidesteps these “delicate\nissues” when he gives them his full attention (1980, p. 21, n.\n21). \nThere are stronger and weaker brands of necessity corresponding to the\npossible notions of rigidity. Kripke argues that a sentence like\n‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’ is at least “weakly”\nnecessary (1971, p. 137): true in all those possible worlds in which\nHesperus exists and Phosphorus exists. The statement may enjoy a\nstronger necessity, too, which would render it true in all worlds,\n period.[2]\n In this entry, “necessity” is to be understood as weak\nnecessity (at least). \nRigidity is most straightforwardly applied to proper names of concrete\nobjects. There is general agreement that ‘Hesperus’ and\n‘Barack Obama’ refer rigidly. The debate about which\nexpressions in natural languages are rigid designators is typically\nset up with a background assumption that proper names are singular\nterms. Though this assumption has been challenged (Fara, 2015), I will\nnevertheless assume it for presentational purposes in what follows.\n \nRigidity is also applied commonly to indexicals, like\n‘now’ or ‘you’. If, when I use\n‘you’ in a context, my utterance means something like\nthe person at the door (Nunberg 1993; Smith 1989 §5),\nthen presumably it is not rigid. You may be at the door, but in\nanother possible world it is another philosopher who comes visiting.\nOn the other hand, if (as Kaplan proposes: 1989a) ‘you’\nrefers directly to an individual, without amounting to a disguised\ndescription meaning the same as a description like ‘the person\nat the door’, then it would seem to be rigid. So if I say,\npleasantly surprised, “You made good time,” we could\ndiscuss reasons for this and conditions under which this might not\nhave been the case, but in all of our considerations the same\nindividual, and not anyone else who might have been at my door in good\ntime or not, is the one in question. The individual in question is the\none who is in fact identical to you (as any account\ncould put it). After Kaplan, indexicals have typically been treated as\nrigid; but there seem to be nonrigid uses.  \nDemonstratives such as ‘that’ raise similar issues as\nindexicals. So also do noun phrases like ‘that flower you just\npicked’ (see King 2001, chap 2, for discussion). As Wolter\n(2009, p. 457) observes, “there is not yet consensus”\nabout which such expressions “allow non-rigid interpretations\nand which do not.”  \nThe paradigm example of non-rigid designators, since the work\nof of Kripke, has been standard definite descriptions, such as\n‘the brightest non-lunar object in the evening sky’.\nHowever, some definite descriptions, such as ‘the successor of\n2’, are rigid designators; their rigidity seems to arise in\nvirtue of facts about metaphysical reality, in this case, the\nnecessity of mathematical facts, rather than facts about the semantic\nproperties of expressions. Such definite descriptions are therefore\n“de facto” rigid designators. The Russellian view that\ndefinite descriptions are quantified expressions is also widely held.\nSince it is natural to think of rigidity but not, in view of Russell,\nto think of definite descriptions in connection with singularity, the\nquestion dawns of how to think about rigidity with categories of\nexpressions other than singular terms. This broad topic, which\nsurfaces in other connections too, has received much discussion in\nrecent years.  \nAnother category of terms whose singular status raises questions is\nthat of natural kind terms like ‘gold’ and\n‘water’. Again, these seem widely to be thought singular\nat least some of the time. They are frequently counted as rigid. Other\nrelated and again apparently singular terms that are sometimes counted\nrigid include ‘redness’ and ‘loudness’. More\ncontroversial are singular terms for properties that are more\nartificial: ‘bachelorhood’, or ‘soda pop’. \nNot just singular terms but also general terms, like\n‘tiger’, ‘hot’, and ‘red’ are\noften recognized as rigid (following Kripke's suggestion: 1980, p.\n134). These terms raise complications not present for singular\nterms. \nTerms from other grammatical categories, as well, might admit a\nrigid/non-rigid distinction. Philosophers have attended relatively\nlittle to the status of verbs and adverbs, in this connection (but\nsee, e.g., López de Sa 2008). Compare ‘to begin\nwriting’, ‘to commence writing’, and ‘to do\nwhat the teacher commanded at time t’ (where the\ncommand was, “Begin writing”). Evidently, the necessity of\n‘One is about to begin writing if and only if one is about to\ncommence writing’ is not enjoyed by ‘One is about to begin\nwriting if and only if one is about to do what the teacher commanded\nat time t’. Arguably, the reason for the modal\ndifferences has to do with the rigidity or non-rigidity, in some\nappropriately extended sense, of the contained verbs. Something\nsimilar applies to adverbs. Compare ‘She ran quickly’ with\n‘She ran in the manner signaled by her coach’ (where the\nsignal means: Run quickly!).  \nJust as rigidity might have bearing on different grammatical\ncategories, not merely the paradigms to which Kripke applies it,\nrigidity might also have bearing on different modalities. For example,\njust as ‘the brightest non-lunar object in the evening\nsky’ seems to designate Venus with respect to the actual\nworld but not with respect to other possible worlds in which\nVenus is obscured by some other body like Mars, just so the expression\nseems to designate Venus with respect to the present time but\nnot with respect to other times at which Venus is obscured by some\nother body. By contrast, ‘Hesperus’ and\n‘Phosphorus’ seem to designate Venus with respect to all\ntimes. (For cautions about the analogy, see Gómez-Torrente\n2006, p. 249.) Therefore, again, ‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’\nseems to be true regardless of the time of utterance; ‘Hesperus\n= the brightest nonlunar body in the evening sky’, on the other\nhand, is false when uttered as a passing comet outshines Venus.  \nWhether we are talking about alethic rigidity (designation of\nthe same individual with respect to other possible worlds) or\ntemporal rigidity (designation of the same individual with\nrespect to other times), a commitment to rigidity will be\nattended by similar sorts of metaphysical and epistemic\ncommitments. Here it will do to indicate briefly some\nontological parallels having to do with the status of individuals with\nrespect to other possible worlds, on the one hand, and times on the\nother. Just as recognition of alethically rigid designation carries\nwith it a commitment to some sort of transworld identity\n(discussed later), so the recognition of temporally rigid designation\ncarries with it a commitment to some sort of “transtime”\nor transtemporal identity. Similar alternatives to rigidity are\navailable to theorists who would deny that the relevant designators\nare indeed rigid—and the choices are similarly motivated. Hence,\nif we adopt the ontological position that individuals are\ninstantaneous so that we find it natural to think in terms of the\n“stages” of you since, although the stages are not\nidentical, they're similar and ordered in relation to one another\nspatiotemporally or causally, then we might naturally take names like\nyours to range over different instantaneously-lasting individuals, and\nso conclude with Varzi (2003, p. 387), that “the rigidity claim\ncan't be right and a counterpart-theoretic semantics seems\nrequired.” \nFamiliar, broadly applicable reservations about the reduction of modal\ntalk to counterparts talk arise in their own turn: namely reservations\naccording to which ordinary speakers' accurate talk of a future and a\npast for you uses ‘you’ and your name\n rigidly,[3]\n since ordinary speakers presuppose or assert that something in the\npast and something in the future is identical to you. The\ncounterpart substitute, it will be said, is either a misdiagnosis or a\ntacit concession to the falsity of ordinary claims and a masking over\nof that falsity by means of a so-called reductive analysis. Quinn, for\nexample, anticipates the dilemma, maintaining that identity through\ntime is what is needed to honor claims to an individual's lasting\nthrough a day, and maintaining further that if we conclude that we\ndon't really last over time, and decide anyway that “it\nwould be convenient to speak” in some counterpart-reductive\nfashion in order to be able still to assent when ordinary\nspeakers innocently say ‘You were around yesterday and will\nprobably be around tomorrow’, then we end up masking our\ndisagreement with what ordinary speakers literally claim (1978, p.\n348). Metaphysical positions of great consequence are thereby\nconcealed: ‘you'll be around tomorrow’ is now, according\nto the newly proposed reductive reading, to be accepted on the liberal\nterms that tomorrow there is a line of “momentary creatures\nendowed with similar properties,” none of whom is really you.\nBut were a reductionist to affirm correctly the usual sentence, now\neviscerated of the usual content, the affirmation should bring you\n“no comfort at all” (1978, p. 350; see also p. 347). The\nhope is that you yourself are around tomorrow; if others are around\ntoo, that might be good, but it is not enough to satisfy your hope.\n(So we would put it if we believed in the reality of different times.\nMore neutrally, we might put the point as follows. When we conceive of\ntomorrow, you're part of what we're conceiving as present, hopefully;\nif others are around too, that is irrelevant to this hope.) Since the\nsentence ‘you'll be around tomorrow’ on its original\ninterpretation expresses comfortingly that your hope is to be\nrealized, and since the reductive assent does not, the reductive\nassent hardly ends up conveying the appropriate opinion about what\nordinary speakers are talking about.  \nKripke presents rigidity first as an alethic notion but there\nis also a temporal interpretation, as we've seen. There are\nother interpretations too, which is not surprising if rigidity is\nfundamental to all our modal talk: and it seems reasonable to say,\nwith Føllesdal, that it is. “All our talk about change, about\ncausation, ethics and knowledge and belief, as well as about the other\nmodalities, presupposes that we can keep our singular terms referring\nto the same objects. To the extent that we fail, these notions become\nincoherent” (Føllesdal 1986, p. 111).  \nFurthermore, a term might rigidly designate under\none interpretation of rigidity but non-rigidly designate under a\ndifferent interpretation of rigidity: thus, ‘Hesperus =\nPhosphorus’ is apparently not epistemically necessary,\neven though it seems alethically and temporally\nnecessary; accordingly, ‘Hesperus’ and\n‘Phosphorus’ are plausibly thought not to be epistemically\nrigid. Indeed, as Fitting and Mendelsohn (1998, p. 219)\nobserve, “it is hard to see whether there are any rigid\ndesignators under the epistemic reading.” This entry will\naddress an alethic interpretation of rigidity for the most part. \nA rigid designator designates by picking out its designatum not just\nwith respect to the actual world—as things are—but with\nrespect to all other possible worlds in which it is present, as well.\nThat a proper name like your name is rigid by way of picking out its\nsame designatum (you) with respect to possible worlds or situations\ndifferent than those actually obtaining, though that claim is not\nwithout detractors, is a claim that enjoys great appeal. Call the\nrelevant claim “transworld identity.” The claim is\nassociated with a host of others that might enjoy much less\nappeal. Many such claims turn out to be separable from rigidity.\nNevertheless, transworld identity remains a substantive commitment of\nrigidity, at least as classically understood. \nThe commitment to transworld identity should not be confused\nwith a commitment to realism about possible worlds. Prominent\nchampions of rigidity seem favorably inclined to realism (see\nDavidson's 2003 collection of Plantinga's essays; see also Kripke\n1980, p. 16). But there is no reason an instrumentalist about possible\nworlds like Bas Van Fraassen, say, who regards possible-worlds talk as\na useful fiction, cannot appeal to rigidity (as Van Fraassen does:\n1984). What matters to rigidity, or rather to the position that a\ndesignator for an individual x is a rigid designator, is that\nin using that designator to entertain the various counterfactual\nsituations or worlds S in which x exists, whether we\ndo the counterfactual entertaining about x by way of\napprehending abstracta, say (if worlds are real objects, abstract\nones), or by way of pretending (if counterfactual talk is a fictional\npretense, say, because worlds are not real) or whatnot, we entertain\nsituations (or pretend to do so) that, were they to obtain,\nwould contain x: so we tacitly commit to “the\nimpossibility that S obtain and x fail to\nexist” (Plantinga 1974, p. 96). Accordingly, suppose I say to\nyou, “If you'd driven to the park instead of walked, you'd have\nmissed the refreshing breeze.” Here I entertain a nonfactual\npossibility associated with your driving to the park. Whom, in that\nentertained possibility, do we think of and speak of, as driving and\nnot walking? The transworld-identity theorist says: you. No one else\n“gets into the act” as the driver according to the\ntransworld-identity theorist (as Lewis would frame that view, without\nsympathy: 1986, p. 196). \nRealism about worlds, then, is not something rigidity or transworld\nidentity comes attached to; non-realists have their version. \nHow about essentialism? Whether we want to say that rigidity\nor transworld identity is committed on that score might well depend on\nthe form of essentialism in question. Not many philosophers would\ndispute Cartwright's observation that “‘Shakespeare’\nis rigid only if the man Shakespeare could not have existed\nwithout being Shakespeare—or as we might equally well say, only\nif it is essential to Shakespeare that he is Shakespeare”\n(Cartwright 1998, p. 69). So if Shakespeare could have been Obama\ninstead of Shakespeare, ‘Shakespeare’ would not be\nrigid. \nBut even if appeals to the rigidity of a name like\n‘Shakespeare’ (or related appeals to the transworld\nidentity of Shakespeare) cannot be divorced from essentialist\ncommitments like the forgoing, such appeals will not commit us to much\nat all about what a designatum is essentially like with\nrespect to the various possible worlds in which it exists to serve as\nthe designatum: whether Shakespeare could have been a brute, say, or\nhad different parents (matters over which Kripke tellingly disagrees\nwith, say, Plantinga: Kripke 1980, pp. 110ff; Plantinga 1974, pp.\n65ff).  \nIt is far from clear then, that transworld identity and the rigidity\nthat depends on it come attached to substantive essentialism of a sort\nthat settles salient disputes in philosophy about which of your\nproperties are essential to you. Closely related to the issue of\nsubstantive essences is the issue of substantive criteria,\nperhaps qualitative criteria. Such concerns, as developed in the\nmetaphysically oriented direction of transworld identity,\nwill be addressed broadly speaking in connection with counterpart\ntheory; here let us move in an epistemological direction in order to\naddress concerns about what we might call transworld\n“identification.”  \nKripke addresses the objection that we cannot meaningfully talk about\nyou, with respect to another possible world, without first having some\nqualitative criterion of identity, some qualitatively distinguishing\nmark that allows us to pick you out from other objects in the world at\nissue, in order to assign your name to the right person, i.e., to you,\nas the individual that satisfies the qualitative criterion. This\ncriterion would appeal to your essence (or be “an\n essence”[4]; bear in mind, for this example, the minimal requirements of weak necessity from 1.2),\n in the minimal respect that the criterion must be something that you\nand you alone have with respect to any given possible world. As an\nobjection, the worry is that we know of no such qualitative criterion\nso we can not meaningfully discuss you, with respect\nto any merely possible world.  \nOne way to defend rigid designation in view of the forgoing objection\nwould be to insist that as successful speakers, we do after all know\nof qualitative criteria by which we are able to distinguish\nindividuals like you by name: some historical figures have in effect\nadopted this position by way of defending rigid\n designation.[5]\n But Kripke would concede that we speakers are not privy to the\ncontent of any qualitative criterion characterizing you. It is hard to\ngainsay the concession. We would certainly be hard-pressed to say in\nany enlightening way just what qualities characterize you with respect\nto the various possible worlds. Kripke would evidently agree that\nthere is something that it is to amount to you, as opposed to anything\nelse, and that your essence is what qualifies an\nobject—you—to be the designatum of your name with respect\nto any possible world (he doesn't say that your essence is qualitative\nthough, and he outright rejects certain versions of that claim). But\nKripke would deny that a speaker would have to know this\nessence, or to rely upon any other nontrivial criteria distinguishing\nyou from world to world, in order to refer to you by way of a rigid\ndesignator (Kripke 1980, pp. 15-20; see also Plantinga 1974, pp.\n93-98). \nStill, we can imagine why others have demurred. After all, if we lack\nthe ability to say in an informative way just what it is to amount to\nyou, as opposed to anyone else, with respect to counterfactual\nsituations, then how can we as speakers know enough of what\nwe're talking about in order to select you as the designatum,\nas opposed to anyone else, with respect to counterfactual situations?\nHow can we know that you, no other, are the subject of our thought and\ntalk? We certainly cannot define your name rigidly by means\nof essence-invoking criteria if we don't know such criteria. \nIn response, Kripke (1980, p. 44; see also Plantinga 1974, p. 97)\ninsists that we may give a satisfactory account of how we designate\nyou, trans-world, without giving a satisfying account of your essence\nor of criteria distinguishing you. Whatever the content of your\nessence, we may simply stipulate that the bearer of your name\nis to be you when we consider other possible worlds in which you do\ndifferent things than those that you in fact do. Accordingly, we may\ntake for granted that you are the protagonist of the\ndifferent actions at those different worlds, despite our not thinking\nabout what your essence is. \nThere would appear to be something robustly sensible in this\nsuggestion. It seems sensible to suppose that ordinary speakers do\nsomething like stipulate: a speaker might naturally insist, “I'm\nthinking of you driving instead of walking, by\nGeorge!—I have told you that. What's the difficulty?” It\nalso seems sensible, at least on first blush, to take the success of\nthis stipulation for granted, at least for many purposes, in many\ncontexts. \nEven so, the worries that motivate an appeal to stipulation still\nremain, in large part, to be accounted for, after we have\nprovisionally set them aside by approving the appeal: the appeal to\nstipulation is more like a promissory note than the satisfaction of an\nexplanatory obligation. The appeal to stipulation puts off for another\noccasion any attempt to resolve how we succeed at doing what\nwe take for granted that we manage somehow to do: namely, how we\nsucceed at referring to the right individual, by means of our\nstipulative effort. There has to be some “reason the\nstipulated situation, when we use a name, contains the object it\ndoes” (Sidelle 1995, p. 99n.4) rather than likely competitors.\nIt is hardly obvious what that reason would be. To see why, consider\nthat in order successfully to stipulate that a name is to follow just\nyou, as a rigid and therefore transworld tracking device, our\nstipulative effort has to be able, across worlds, to allow us to\ndistinguish what is you from what is not you but is instead\nyour body (say: assume you are not your body). How is this to\nbe done without specifying criteria, if you were with your body when\nyour parents smiled in your direction and baptized you with a rigid\ndesignator, saying “We have decided on a name for the birth\ncertificate: …,” thereby stipulating that you are to be\ncalled by the name they chose for you? “It is not by\nmagic,” as Jackson (1998, p. 82) reminds us, that your name\npicks out what it does pick out rigidly—namely\nyou—despite the competition against you presented by a different\ncandidate for designation—your copresent body. \nSo how does it happen that the stipulative effort attaches your name\nto you and not competitors? According to a Lockean line of thinking,\nthe indispensability of criteria becomes clear when we\nconsider that question; stipulation is no substitute for criteria. For\nJohn Locke, unless a speaker baptizing a term were to have essential\ncriteria in mind to demarcate the real referent—you, in\nthis instance—from alternative candidates like your body, the\nspeaker would stipulate a rigid designator in vain: his names would\nturn out, disappointingly, to be “the Signs of he knows not\nwhat, which is in Truth to be the Signs of nothing”\n(Essay III.ii.2, p. 406). On this line of thinking, a\nstipulation leaves too much indeterminacy to secure the right\nrigidity. To insist that the right designatum is secured without\ncriteria seems, according to this line of thinking, to insist on\nstipulation getting it right by magic.  \nSo there is more to be said about transworld criteria, even if an\nappeal to stipulation is all right so far as it goes. But because the\nrelevant contributions to the discussion become scattered and\nelliptic, a supplementary document is handy for elaboration: \nIt is not obvious that rigidity and its attending transworld identity\nrun up against anti-realism, nor against any substantive essentialism\nand its gainsayers, nor against the intuition that there must be\nsome way to assign reference that avoids (perhaps by way of\nqualitative criteria) the charge according to which the relation\nbetween rigid designator and designatum comes by magic. But rigidity\nand its attending transworld identity do run into genuine conflict\nwith certain metaphysical positions about what we're talking about\nwhen we engage in counterfactual talk. The most prominent alternative\nto the commitment construes modal discourse about you in terms of \ncounterparts of you who are not you and who act in your stead at\nother possible worlds. Thus, for David Lewis and fellow counterpart\ntheorists, what matters to whether you might have driven instead of\nwalked is indeed whether, in other possible worlds, someone other than\nyou—but sufficiently similar qualitatively to you—drives\ninstead of walks. So for Lewis, you don't have an important\nrole, or indeed any role, among the players of the\ndriving-as-opposed-to-walking worlds: and your qualities do.\nYou are altogether absent from any world we entertain in considering\nthe driving scenario as a scenario that you might have opted\nfor, and in considering such a scenario we are not entertaining a\nthought about you as the protagonist. Let us call this proposal\nconcerning counterfactual talk “serious counterpart\ntheory” (following Russell 2013, p. 87). \nThe proposal that it is not you yourself but similar\n“counterparts” to you, who are relevant in this way to\nwhat you yourself might have done, is unappealing at face value:\nintuitively, as Noonan says, a claim about what you opted not to do\nbut certainly might have done hardly seems, at first sight, to\nbe correctly interpretable as a claim about what someone else\n(however similar…) does in another possible world\n(§6 of the entry on\n identity:\n this is a cleaned-up version of the so-called “Humphrey\nobjection”: Kripke 1980, p. 45n.13; 1971, p. 148; cf. Lewis'\nreplies to the Humphrey objection as originally cast: Lewis 1986,\np. 196). \nIndeed, one might go further by way of objections to the\ncounterpart-construal of modal discourse, as Plantinga and Salmon do.\nPlantinga argues at length that the counterpart theorist's mistake is\nnot really to misinterpret ‘you might have\ndriven’, by offering an erroneous analysis of what makes it\ntrue; rather, the counterpart theorist's mistake is two-fold: the\nfirst mistake is to reject what ordinary speakers are saying\nby ‘you might have driven’, and the second mistake (a\ndeviation from prudence) is to conceal the disagreement. The\nconcealment is effected by assigning to the very same\nsentence used by ordinary speakers, ‘you might have\ndriven’, an alien interpretation that the (serious) counterpart\ntheorist can endorse, rather than the interpretation that would in\nfact be faithful to what the ordinary speakers are really saying. The\nnew counterpart-involving interpretation renders reinterpreted\nsentences, no longer English, agreeable or offensive to the\nmetaphysical commitments of a counterpart theorist pretty much when\nthe respective English sentence does likewise for English speakers. In\nthis way, the counterpart theorist can affirm and reject the usual\nmodal sentences of English, understanding them differently\nthough: so the counterpart theorist maintains the deceptive appearance\nof agreement with ordinary speakers by means of “a verbal\ncamouflage,” as Salmon agrees (Salmon 1981, p. 236; cf.\nStalnaker 2003, pp. 118ff.). \nFor her part, the counterparts-invoking theorist might emphasize the\ndesirability of\n reduction.[6]\n Or she might point to other desiderada: for another likely example,\nshe might wish to maintain contingency where rigidity commits us to\nnecessity (Gibbard 1975, p. 188; Lewis 1986, p. 256; Delia Graff Fara\njoins many others in counting this as “the main benefit”\nof a counterpart construal: 2008, p. 186). One might turn to\ncounterpart theory for relief from vagueness, since whether an object\nessentially has any given property can be a vague question;\non the other hand, so too can the “question whether an object\nactually has a certain property,”as Kripke suggests\n(1980, p.115n.57). There are other motives. \nThe issues at stake between serious counterpart theory and transworld\nidentity become complex quickly. The tangle of considerations can be\nmore formally motivated than are the intuitive considerations already\ncanvassed. Your theory might force unwelcome baroqueness in\nexpression, when formalized (Linsky and Zalta 1996; Williamson 2000;\n2002). Worse, you might find that you cannot even say in the preferred\nformal language what you want, intuitively, to say: e.g., “There\ncould have been things that do not actually exist” (Russell\ndiscusses the history of this example: 2013, p. 485). \nIf its defenders are right, then counterpart theory can express all\nthat anyone wants to express—even what transworld identity\ntheorists want to express (Bacon forthcoming; Russell 2013). If so,\nthen such qualms about formal resources need not divide\nserious-counterpart theorists from transworld identity theorists (and\nsimilarly for transtime identity theorists like Quinn 1978 (Meyer\n2013)). But that would not reduce any divisiveness in the foregoing\nintuitive metaphysical considerations (these are the considerations\nthat “must always play a dominant role,” too, according to\nKripkean methodology anyway: 1976, p. 411). \nRigidity is generally discussed in the literature in connection with\nseveral theories about reference that were introduced or reintroduced\nor discussed feverishly about the time Kripke called attention to\nrigid designation. These theories address either the question of what\nit is that designating terms say or express or contribute to the\ncontent of propositions that they are used to articulate, or the\nquestion how it is that designating terms come to say or express or\ncontribute the content they do. The relationship between rigidity and\nthese other theories of reference, which is often blurred in the\nliterature, can be brought into focus in a way that is fairly\nuncontroversial, in many instances. \nAbout the time Kripke named rigidity, Kaplan named the theory of\n“direct reference” (in “Demonstratives,”\neventually published as 1989a: see 1989b, p. 571). As the theory is\nusually understood, it is the position that the semantic content of a\nname or other directly referring expression is nothing more than the\nreferent: the referent is all that the name contributes to a\nproposition expressed by a sentence containing it. So there is no\ndescriptive information semantically conveyed by a directly referring\nexpression. If we think of propositions as “structured entities\nlooking something like the sentences which express them,” as\nKaplan invites us to do, we can think of directly referring terms as\nterms whose contribution to a proposition lacks the structure that\ncharacterizes the contribution of definite descriptions. In the case\nof a definite description, “the constituent of the proposition\nwill be some sort of complex, constructed from various attributes by\nlogical composition. But in the case of a singular term which is\ndirectly referential, the constituent of the proposition is just the\nobject itself” (Kaplan 1989a, p. 494; see also the section\nrelating possible worlds and structured propositions in the entry on\n structured propositions). \nDirect reference theorists (e.g., Soames 2002, pp. 240, 243), also\ncalled “Millians” after J. S. Mill, insist that\n‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’ and ‘Hesperus =\nHesperus’ express the same proposition or share the same\ncontent. At first glance, these statements appear to say different\nthings, but if ‘Hesperus’ and ‘Phosphorus’\ncontribute no descriptive information (like is a morning star\nor is an evening star) to the proposition expressed by either\nsentence, but only the referent, which is the same for each term, then\nthe sentences have to say the same thing despite first appearances.\n \nIt is generally acknowledged that rigidity cannot be\nidentified with direct reference. That is because some\nexpressions designate rigidly by means of describing the\ndesignatum: e.g., ‘The successor of 2’, which rigidly\ndesignates 3. Kripke calls designators like ‘The successor of\n2’ rigid de facto, rather than rigid de jure:\nthe description happens to be satisfied by the same object in every\npossible world and never anything else. Compare the intuitively\ndistinct case of de jure rigidity in a name, like\n‘Barack Obama’. Here the intent is to refer to this\nperson in all possible worlds, whatever descriptions may\ndesignate him. \nEven though there are rigid designators that are not directly\nreferential, it is plausible to suppose that all directly referential\nexpressions are rigid designators (as Kaplan suggests: 1989b, p. 571).\nRigid directly referential expressions would evidently be rigid de\njure. According to some philosophers, it would be metaphysically\npossible to coin non-rigid directly referential expressions,\nby devising some means of assuring that they change their designatum\nfrom world to world. Teresa Robertson, for example, maintains\n“the possibility that a term that is nondescriptional is\nnonetheless stipulated to work in the following way: it designates\nPenelope Mackie at the actual world, Saul Kripke at some other\npossible world, and Hilary Putnam at some still other possible\nworld” (Robertson 2009, p. 135; see also Salmon 1981, p.\n33n.35). Others controvert this claim, modest as it is, being only a\nclaim about possible languages rather than English, French,\netc.—e.g., Arthur Sullivan: “What I deny is the\npossibility of an unstructured but nonrigid designator”\n(Sullivan 2012 p. 37; see also Balaguer 2011, p. 77; Soames 2002, pp.\n264–5; King 2001, p. 311). \nLet me take stock briefly. Not all rigid expressions are directly\nreferential; there are descriptions that are rigid de facto. But some\nphilosophers say that all directly referential expressions are rigid\nand rigid de jure. There remain the questions of whether all terms\nthat are rigid de jure would have to be, and whether they\nare, directly referential. \nThe theory of direct reference for names is so intimately associated\nwith the theory that names are rigid de jure that some philosophers\nwho deny that names are directly referential suppose that they are\nthereby compelled to deny that names are rigid de jure (see Fitch's\n2004 discussion, p. 54). But there are reasons for supposing that an\nexpression could be rigid de jure without being directly referential\n(as some direct reference theorists agree: e.g., Kaplan 1989b, p.\n577n.25; cf. Salmon 2003, pp. 486–7; see also Stanley's 1997a\ndiscussion: 570–1). If expressions could be rigid de jure\nwithout being directly referential, then even if names are not\ndirectly referential, they might be rigid de jure. \nHere are some considerations in favor of saying that an expression\ncould be rigid de jure without directly referring to its designatum.\nSuppose that ‘Petrarch’ is, contrary to direct reference\ntheorists, a disguised description, shorthand for ‘The famous\nhumanist most closely associated, in α, with the Italian\nRenaissance’, where ‘α’ is a name for the\nactual world. This is one simple, though perhaps not highly plausible,\naccount available to opponents of the theory of direct reference: it\nwill do for illustration of this\n point.[7]\n If this descriptive account is correct, then ‘Petrarch’\nis rigid: in any other possible world w,\n‘Petrarch’ designates the entity that, in α (not\nw), is the famous humanist most closely associated with the\nItalian Renaissance. That person is Petrarch. ‘Petrarch’\nrefers to the same individual in all possible worlds and never to any\nother individual, so it is rigid. Plausibly, in this circumstance\n‘Petrarch’ is also rigid de jure and not de\nfacto: after all, it is by stipulation or design that the term\nrefers, in all possible worlds, to the same item. This term is\nassigned the task of picking out in any world the item that meets\ncertain world-indexed descriptive requirements (for discussion of\nworld-indexed properties, see Plantinga 1974, pp. 62–5). The\ndesignatum must first be picked out in α by whether it meets the\ndescriptive requirements (with or without the indexing) there in\nα: but the purpose of the indexing is to keep the term\nreferring, with respect to other worlds, to that same item\npicked out originally in α by virtue of meeting the right\nrequirements there. \nIf the above considerations are sound, then there could be\nrigid de jure terms that fail to be directly referential. Whether\nthere are in fact any rigid de jure terms that fail to be\ndirectly referential, in natural language, is another\nquestion. Ordinary names like ‘Barack Obama’,\n‘Petrarch’, or ‘Italy’, which are commonly\nsupposed to be rigid de jure if any expressions are, are going to\nremain controversial examples as long as the theory of direct\nreference for these expressions is controversial. Typical\n“descriptivists,” who oppose direct reference, hold that\nordinary proper names and the like are not directly referential. They\nmay hold furthermore that no terms are directly referential,\nperhaps doubting the coherence of direct reference on grounds, say,\nthat direct reference “leaves no room for a coherent\nconception” of how thoughts or words could be hooked up with the\nright “particulars otherwise than by specification”\n(McDowell 1994, pp. 106-7).  \nBy contrast, typical direct reference theorists hold, naturally\nenough, that ordinary proper names and the like are directly\nreferential. Many direct reference theorists seem furthermore to think\nthat all rigid de jure expressions whatsoever are directly\nreferential, but again this further step should not be accepted as a\nmatter of course, because even if ordinary names and the like\nare directly referential, there may well be other expressions\nthat are not directly referential by anyone's lights but that are\nstill rigid de jure (literature on all of this may be gathered from\nsurveys cited in\n note 7). \nSo, while opponents of the theory of direct reference are free to deny\nthat names are rigid or rigid de jure (as, e.g., Rosenberg does:\n1994), it is hardly clear that this is a general requirement for\naccounts opposed to direct reference. Many opponents of the theory of\ndirect reference maintain that names are rigid or rigid de jure\n(Plantinga 1985, pp. 82–7; Sidelle 1992; 1995; Justice 2003).\nKripke remains uncommitted one way or the other about the theory of\ndirect reference (1979; 1980, pp. 20–21), but of course he is\nthe first to come to mind among those committed to the position that\nproper names are rigid de jure (1980, p. 21n.21). \nAnother theory of reference that was named about the time ‘rigid\ndesignator’ was coined, and that is widely associated with rigid\ndesignation, is the causal theory of reference. All that is relevant\nhere is one method of term dubbing associated with that theory.\nAccording to a typical causal theorist, many terms are coined in a\n“baptismal ceremony,” during which the dubber points at an\nobject in her perceptual field (hence, the object's causal role), and\nestablishes reference by appeal to this object. The baptismal object\nmight become the referent, if the term's coiner says something to this\neffect: “Term t is to be used for that\nobject.” The baptismal object might also be a sample of a\nsubstance that becomes the referent, if the term's coiner says\nsomething to this effect: “Term t is to be used for the\nsubstance instantiated by that object.” Or the\nobject might have some other connection to the referent, as might\nhappen if the term's coiner says something to this effect: “Term\nt is to be used for the ceremonial function of that\nancient artifact,” or “Term t is to be used for\nthe leader of that wolf pack.” Most of these examples\ninvolve a definite description, which is used to “fix the\nreference” (Kripke 1980, pp. 54–6, 135), and not as a\nsynonym: the term is to apply to the designatum even with respect\nworlds in which it does not satisfy the description. In all of these\nexamples, whether the relevant term designates in a given instance\ndepends on the properties of the object used to ground reference in\nthe baptismal ceremony. The relevant properties may not be known to\nthe term's coiner. \nSome philosophers seem to think that rigid terms are just those coined\nin accordance with a baptism like the\n above.[8]\n But causal grounding is not closely tied to rigidity. Since many\nphilosophers deny that rigidity applies to designators for kinds (see\nbelow), designators for other entities serve better to illustrate.\nFirst, designators that are rigid can fail to be causally grounded.\n‘The successor of 2’, which is rigid de facto, may be a\ncase in point. ‘3’ might be an example of a rigid de\njure term that is not causally grounded. And there can evidently\nbe terms for concrete objects that are rigid but not causally\ngrounded. You coin ‘Joy’ in the following way:\n“‘Joy’ is to be used for the most joy-filled\nindividual.” Here you use the description to fix the reference,\nnot as a synonym: whatever individual is most filled with joy is the\ndesignatum, even when we are discussing worlds in which that same\nindividual is glum. Reference is not secured by way of causal\ngrounding; you never point to anything in a baptismal\n ceremony.[9]\n Yet the designator is rigid. \nSo designators that are rigid might fail to be causally grounded.\nDesignators that are causally grounded might also fail to be rigid.\nYou find an old painting. After engaging in some convoluted discussion\nabout legal ownership, you decide to clarify your terms: “Let\nthe expression ‘Originalowner’ designate, for any possible\nworld w, the original owner in w of that\npainting” (you point at the painting). You have causally\ngrounded ‘Originalowner’ by means of a baptismal ceremony;\nbut the referent varies from world to world, depending on who first\nowned the painting. The term is not rigid. \nNames might be disguised descriptions that are world-indexed. Of\ncourse, they might not be disguised descriptions that are\nworld-indexed, too (nor descriptions that are otherwise rigidified: a\npopular objection to rigidified descriptivism is discussed below in\n §2.2.3.2;\n for more objections, see Soames 2002, pp. 39ff.); but the point here\nis that so far as the thesis that names are rigid designators\nis concerned, the matter could go either way. Sections (2.3.1.1) and\n(2.3.2.2) discuss strategies for maintaining descriptivism according\nto which a name like ‘Petrarch’ has the same content as a\ntraditional, non-world-indexed description like ‘The famous\nhumanist most closely associated with the Italian\nRenaissance’. \nOne proposal to defend traditional, non-world-indexed descriptivism\nhas taken the label “widescopism.” According to this\nproposal, the rigidity of names is or may be treated as a matter of\nscope. ‘Petrarch’, on this view, may be a disguised\nordinary description meaning the same as ‘The famous humanist\nmost closely associated with the Italian Renaissance’. It is\nnatural to think that ‘Petrarch’ cannot have this semantic\ncontent, since ‘Petrarch might not have been famous’ seems\nunambiguously true, but ‘The famous humanist most closely\nassociated with the Italian Renaissance might not have been\nfamous’ has a false reading. It can have the same truth\nconditions as a scoped sentence something like, ‘It might have\nbeen the case that: for some x, x is the famous\nhumanist most closely associated with the Italian Renaissance and\nx has never been famous’, which is false. But according\nto the proposal in question, the false reading for ‘The famous\nhumanist most closely associated with the Italian Renaissance might\nnot have been famous’ does not show that ‘Petrarch’\nfails to mean the same as ‘the famous humanist most closely\nassociated with the Italian Renaissance’. The other reading is\nthe relevant one. According to that reading, the name takes wide\nscope, and the truth conditions are the same as those for a sentence\nlike, ‘For some x, x is the famous humanist\nmost closely associated with the Italian Renaissance and it might have\nbeen the case that: x has never been famous’, which is\ntrue. \nKripke (1980 pp. 11–15) points out that there are problems with\nthis attempt to accommodate rigidity. Some sentences have no modal\noperators. When we evaluate these sentences with respect to other\nworlds, we do not seem to admit that the designatum changes, as it\nwould if names were non-rigid descriptions taking the proper scope in\nmodal contexts. Thus, we can describe a possible world in which\nPetrarch dies as an infant. With respect to such a world, would\n‘Petrarch is never famous’ be true? It seems so. But on\nthe proposal in question, the sentence would say the same as\n‘The famous humanist most closely associated with the Italian\nRenaissance is never famous’, which is false with respect to any\nworld. Also, it seems that we can make names appear inside\nthe scope of a modal operator: “It might have been the case\nthat: Petrarch never became famous.” This would apparently be\nimpossible to do on the view in question, but we seem to be able to do\nit. On the basis of such considerations, Kripke rejects this proposal\nfor accommodating rigidity within descriptivism. \nKripke's arguments seem to have persuaded most of his audience\n(including Salmon 1981, p. 26n.28), and his principal target, Michael\nDummett, has responded by making some modifications (1981, pp.\nxvii-xix). But the issue is not dead; more sophisticated versions of\nthis basic Dummettian position continue to be defended by able\nphilosophers (see, e.g., Sosa 2001; Hunter 2005; cf. Caplan 2005;\nEverett 2005; cf. Soames 2005; a good overview is provided by Noonan 2013, chap\n13). \nAssuming that Kripke's arguments against widescopism are successful,\nit might appear that rigid and nonrigid designators differ in content.\nThus, any statement S containing a proper name cannot\nhave the same content as a statement S′ that differs\nfrom S just in the respect that a proper name in S\nis replaced by a non-rigid designator in S′.\nFollowing Stanley (whose precise formulations differ slightly from\nthis and from each other: 1997a, pp. 568–9; 1997b, p. 135), we\nmight call this the Rigidity Thesis. \nBut Dummett has still another suggestion that, if successful, would\nrefute the Rigidity Thesis (or at least one understanding of it).\nConsider the similarity between (1)–(4): \n(1) The famous humanist most closely associated with the Italian\nRenaissance wrote the epic Africa \n(2) The famous humanist now most closely associated with the\nItalian Renaissance wrote the epic Africa \n(3) The famous humanist here most closely associated with the\nItalian Renaissance wrote the epic Africa \n(4) The famous humanist in α most closely associated\nwith the Italian Renaissance wrote the epic Africa. \nIn some intuitive sense, it might seem that these statements share the\nsame content. Thus, for example, what one believes when one assents to\nany of (2)–(4) might seem to be what one believes when one\nassents to (1). Even so, (1)–(4) contribute different semantic\nvalues to complex sentences in which they are embedded. What one\nbelieves when assenting to (1′) is not what one believes in\nassenting, say, to (2′): \n(1′) It will always be the case that the famous\nhumanist most closely associated with the Italian Renaissance wrote\nthe epic Africa \n(2′) It will always be the case that the famous\nhumanist now most closely associated with the Italian\nRenaissance wrote the epic Africa. \n(1′) is dubiously true, at best. It might well be that Lorenzo\nValla will overtake Petrarch at some future time, being a famous\nhumanist more closely associated with the Italian Renaissance than\nPetrarch. And Valla did not write the epic Africa. On the\nother hand, (2′) is true, at least assuming, for the sake of an\nillustration, that (1) and (2) are true. On that assumption, it does\nnot matter that Valla might overtake Petrarch later: that will be too\nlate to affect their respective status as it is now. \nGiven that (1)–(4) make different semantic contributions to\ncomplex sentences in which they are embedded, must we reject the\nearlier suggestion that they share the same content? Here we might use\na tip from Dummett to resist an affirmative answer. We might\nacknowledge that (1)–(4) share the same truth conditions, which\namount to at least one bona fide use of ‘content’. Thus,\nfor Dummett, a speaker who could classify sufficiently detailed\npossible states of\n affairs[10]\n into those that render any statement like these “correct and\nthose that render it incorrect, may be said to know the assertoric\ncontent of the sentence” (1991, p. 48). And we might also\nacknowledge a distinct phenomenon that is responsible for different\ncontributions (1)–(4) make to larger sentences in which they are\nembedded: Dummett calls this distinct phenomenon a sentence's\n“ingredient sense.” “Ingredient sense is what\nsemantic theories are concerned to explain” (p. 48). \nArmed with the distinction between assertoric content and ingredient\nsense, we might reject the Rigidity Thesis. We might maintain that\n(1)–(4) have the same assertoric content and hence that they say\nthe same thing: anyone who asserts one of these (or believes it,\nrejects it, and so on), also asserts the others. Where they differ is\nin ingredient sense. \nThere are a number of lines of thinking that converge on the\nconclusion that (1)–(4) share the same assertoric content even\nthough they differ in ingredient sense. As already suggested, some\nmight find it natural to take (1)–(4) as expressing the same\n“semantic content” in some meaningful sense (perhaps the\nonly meaningful sense): if so, Dummett's distinction indicates how one\nmight coherently maintain that position. Such a position might be\nespecially natural in view of “descriptive names,” like\nEvans’ famous ‘Julius’, which is a rigid designator\nfor whoever invented the zipper (Evans 1979). It might seem natural to\nsay that ‘Julius is an inventor’ has the same content as\n‘Whoever invented the zipper is an inventor’, even though\nthe former is contingent and the latter necessary. Evans himself\nsuggests that such pairs of sentences “have the same content,\ndespite their modal differences” (Evans 1979, p. 187n.10).  \nThere are other related considerations in favor of saying that\n(1)–(4) share the same assertoric content even though they\ndiffer in ingredient sense: here is a sketch of a couple of\nconsiderations from Stanley, who develops Dummett's suggestion in\nadmirable detail in a series of interesting papers (1997a, 1997b,\n2002). First, one might maintain that what one asserts, when one\nasserts (1), is simply true or false, and not true now but false\nlater, true here but false in some other community where Valla is more\nhighly esteemed than Petrarch, true in α but false in other\npossible worlds. Yet what (1) contributes to the likes of\n(2)–(4) is not simply true or false: it is rather something like\na function from times, places, or worlds, respectively, to truth\nvalues. That function generates a different truth value depending on\nthe argument (Stanley 1997a, p. 577; see also King 2003 §1; for\nrelated claims, see Lewis 1998). Hence, the line of thinking\nconcludes, what is asserted, when one asserts (1), is assertoric\ncontent and not ingredient sense. \nAnother line of thinking by which one might argue that (1)–(4)\nshare the same assertoric content even though they differ in\ningredient sense starts from general considerations about what kind of\nanimal “content” is. For Stanley, the content of a\nstatement is closely tied to what it is used to communicate in normal\ncontexts, where “normal” has to do with the competence of\nspeakers, their intentions to use words as others do, and so on\n(1997b, 136; 2002). In such contexts, he says, (1)–(4) are used\nto communicate the same thing. So they have the same content, the same\nmeaning. Meaning, which facilitates communication in the right\ncontexts, is constituted by presuppositions on the part of speakers.\nIn contexts of modal evaluation, two sentences asserting the same\nthing can diverge in their contribution to larger sentences or diverge\nin truth value with respect to counterfactual worlds under\nconsideration because “meaning-constituting presuppositions are\nirrelevant for modal evaluation. It is the purpose of modal evaluation\nto suspend presuppositions,” on this way of thinking about\ncontent (Stanley 2002, p. 338; see also 1997b, p. 155). \nIf the distinction between assertoric and ingredient sense is tenable,\nand if (1)–(4) share the same assertoric content even though\nthey differ in ingredient sense, so that the Rigidity Thesis is false,\nthen this opens the door to holding that proper names share the same\ncontent as ordinary, non-indexed descriptions after all, even though\nnames are rigid and ordinary, non-indexed descriptions are not rigid.\nIn that case, something along the lines of the venerable descriptivism\nassociated with Frege and Russell (see the subsection on description\ntheories in the entry on\n reference\n and the section on descriptive theories of proper names in the entry\non\n descriptions),\n which Kripke is widely thought to have devastated, survives. One way\nto develop a descriptivism along these lines would be to say that a\nname like ‘Petrarch’ is something like a disguised\ndescription that is shorthand for ‘the famous humanist most\nclosely associated in α with the Italian\nRenaissance’. Although this description for which\n‘Petrarch’ is shorthand is world-indexed, it shares the\ndescriptive content of the non-indexed ‘the famous humanist most\nclosely associated with the Italian Renaissance’. On this\nsuggestion, since ‘Petrarch’ shares the content of the\nrigid description, it also shares the content of the nonrigid\ndescription. \nKripke's reservations about descriptivism go deeper than arguments\nfrom rigidity or indeed arguments from any considerations pertaining\nto the metaphysics of modality: there are quite distinct worries about\nwhether speakers would have to be in possession of the relevant\ndescriptive information to use ‘Petrarch’, for example.\nCould not someone refer to Petrarch by ‘Petrarch’ if she\nsupposed that Valla were the famous humanist most closely associated\nwith the Italian Renaissance and she associated with\n‘Petrarch’ only the description ‘a clergyman who\ncriticized the Avignon papacy’? If so, a standard argument runs,\nthe content of ‘Petrarch’ cannot be the same as that of\n‘the famous humanist most closely associated with the Italian\nRenaissance’. There may be a few descriptive names of\nthe relevant variety in natural language: Dummett adduces ‘St.\nJoachim’, which he takes to have been “introduced as\ndenoting the father of the Blessed Virgin, whoever that may have\nbeen” (1991, p. 48), and Kripke adduces ‘Jack the\nRipper’, introduced for the murderer of so and so (1980,\n79–80). But it is unlikely that there are many such descriptive\nproper names in natural language. Still, it may be that more\nsophisticated descriptivisms appealing to more sophisticated\ndescriptions could overcome worries like these further,\nnon-metaphysical worries about typical names (see, e.g., Nelson\n2002). \nNone of the above considerations (from\n §2.2.3.2)\n in favor of the fruitfulness of distinguishing assertoric content and\ningredient sense is beyond controversy. One might resist (critics\ninclude Everett 2005, pp. 125–38; King 2007, pp. 168–196;\nShieh 2001, pp. 379–80; Soames 2005, pp. 321–3n.; defenders include Ninian 2012; Stalnaker\n2014, pp. 23–24; Yalcin 2014). But the question of whether the\nforegoing descriptivist line of thinking is sound, or whether any\ndescriptivist line is sound, is less important here than the question\nof what rides on the answer for rigidity. \nIf the Dummettian line of thinking from\n §2.2.3.2\n is sound, does rigidity lose its interest? It would appear that the\nanswer is\n No.[11]\n The fundamental work for rigidity sketched already in\n §1.1\n and discussed in greater detail below in\n §3\n seems largely independent of these issues. \nThe fundamental work in question concerns the metaphysics of modality,\nfor the most part. But assertoric content does not have much to do\nwith the metaphysics of modality, so the claim that apparently rigid\ndesignators as well as nonrigid designators have a descriptive\nassertoric content seems not to threaten the extent or significance of\nrigidity: “the propositional content of a sentence in a context\nis not its modal content” (Stanley 2002,\n 338).[12] \nSome of the fundamental work discussed below concerns\nepistemology: e.g., the issue of whether a sentence like\n‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’ is a posteriori as well as\nnecessarily true. Would the above considerations from the foregoing\nsection\n (§2.2.3.2)\n undermine Kripke's ideas here, at least, even if the\nconsiderations do not undermine Kripke's ideas about modality? That\nseems unlikely. On the contrary, the claim that names, though rigid,\nshare the semantic content of descriptions seems likely to\nvindicate Kripke's claims about the epistemic status of\nstatements like the above, if anything. That is because one could say\nthat ‘Hesperus’ and ‘Phosphorus’ differ in\nassertoric content (in an extended sense, applied to designators\nrather than statements) but they do not differ in ingredient sense or\nmodal content. Because they do not differ in ingredient sense or modal\ncontent, being rigid designators for the same thing, ‘Hesperus =\nPhosphorus’ is necessarily true. Because they do differ\nin assertoric content, ‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’ is a\nposteriori; ‘Hesperus = Hesperus’, by contrast, is a\npriori since both occurrences of ‘Hesperus’ have one and\nthe same assertoric content. So descriptivism of this sophisticated\nsort suggests one means to retain Kripke's epistemic claims.\nAnti-descriptivism in the form of direct reference, by contrast, is\nincompatible with at least one interpretation of the claim that\n‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’ is “a posteriori” (but\nonly one interpretation: see below\n §3.1),\n because on the theory of direct reference, ‘Hesperus’ and\n‘Phosphorus’ just share the same content, end of story: so\n‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’ shares the same content as\n‘Hesperus = Hesperus’, which is a priori just in virtue of\ncontent (again, on one interpretation of the claim that the statement\nis “a priori”). \nRigidity's work is compatible with descriptivism. Although some\nphilosophers seem to have the impression that the important work that\nrigidity performs is to refute descriptivism, this seems to\nbe a mistake. A related impression is that the important work that\nKripke performs is to refute descriptivism: the rigidity of\nterms and more just falls out of anti-descriptivism, so\nanti-descriptivism is what really matters at bottom (see below,\n §4.2).\n But there are strong reasons to resist this assessment of rigidity's\nimportance or lack thereof, too. \nFirst, it might be replied that even if names are non-descriptive,\ndirectly referring terms, it might not follow that they are rigid: a\ndirectly referential designator can be nonrigid, at least in principle\n(see\n §2.2.1).\n If this thought is right, then the work that rigidity performs for\nnames does not follow from anti-descriptivism. More is required. \nFurther, even if rigidity does follow from anti-descriptivism,\nanti-descriptivism does not follow from rigidity: so rigidity's work\nis not limited to that of direct reference. We have seen that\ndescriptive designators may be rigid: e.g., world-indexed designators.\nBut rigidity performs much of the same work on these as on arguably\nnondescriptive expressions like names. For example, ‘The evening\nstar in α = the morning star in α’ would seem to be\na necessarily true, a posteriori statement whose necessity and\naposteriority cannot be explained in terms of the nondescriptive\nnature of the designators flanking the ‘=’ sign. \nSuppose we limit our consideration to names. By ignoring\nnon-names, we can ignore descriptive designators that are\nrigid, provided that names are nondescriptive, directly referring\ndesignators: suppose again that they are. Still, it might be wise to\ndistinguish sharply the significance of rigidity from that of the\ntheory of direct reference. That is because rigidity's importance does\nnot hang on the outcome of controversies surrounding the theory of\ndirect reference (a controversial theory, as proponents concede:\nSalmon 2003, p. 475; Soames 2005, p. 3). Where direct reference is\ncalled into question, it should not be thought that rigidity is\nthereby called into question. The fate of rigidity's significance is\ndistinct from the fate of direct reference's\n significance.[13] \nFinally, even if direct reference is to be taken for granted and\nrigidity for names does follow from direct reference, one might not\ndraw the conclusion that rigidity loses interest. Here is an analogy.\nFew would say that if the theory of special relativity, with all of\nits claims about the relativity of space and time, follows from the\ntheory of general relativity, then special relativity loses interest\nbecause in that case, general relativity is what really matters:\nspecial relativity and much more just follow from it. There is\nevidently something wrong with this attempt to devalue the theory of\nspecial relativity. It would be better to say that part of what is\ninteresting about general relativity concerns its implications for the\nrelativity of space and time, as explained by the theory of special\nrelativity: special relativity retains its interest as part of a\nlarger, more fundamental theory. In the same way, rigidity might be\nsaid to lose no interest even if it is explained by something more\nfundamental. \nIt might be tempting, then, to think that if descriptivism survives,\nthen rigidity is useless because its work, which is to refute\ndescriptivism, is left unperformed. It might also be tempting to think\nthat if descriptivism is defeated but by considerations that are more\nfundamental than rigidity and that give rise to rigidity, then\nrigidity is superfluous because its work is performed but by other\nphenomena. The foregoing paragraphs offer reasons for thinking that\nthese tempting lines of thought are erroneous. If these reasons are\nsound, then unless there are other, quite unheralded ties between\nrigidity and descriptivism or its opposition, rigidity's interest\nwould seem to be largely independent of the fate of these rival\ntheories about semantic content. \nAs already indicated, rigidity does interesting epistemological and\nmetaphysical work. Sections (3.1)–(3.5) below discuss various\nareas of work. \nBecause of the rigid designation of the names it contains,\n‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’ is necessarily true. Since\nempirical work on the part of astronomers was required to determine\nthat the statement is true, we seem to have an illustration of\nnecessary, a posteriori truth. Thus, rigid designation seems to play a\ncrucial role in securing necessity with surprising epistemological\nsignificance. Prior to discussion about rigid designation, the\nnecessary a posteriori was generally thought to be an empty category.\nRigid designation, along with other referential mechanisms discussed\nin connection with it, like reference fixing and causal grounding, has\nchanged all that. Thus, Putnam observes that rigidity has\n“startling consequences for the theory of necessary truth”\n(1975, p. 232). \nThere is no question that a major reason for excitement about rigidity\nis that it underwrites the necessary a posteriori (Schwartz 2002, pp.\n270ff.). However, in light of the theory of direct reference, this\napparent coup may have been overstated or misunderstood. As we\nobserved, direct reference theorists insist that ‘Hesperus =\nPhosphorus’ and ‘Hesperus = Hesperus’ express the\nsame proposition or share the same content even though these\nstatements have the appearance of saying different things. For direct\nreference theorists, to say that Hesperus = Phosphorus is to say no\nmore and no less than to say that Hesperus = Hesperus. Since it is a\npriori that Hesperus = Hesperus, it is a priori that Hesperus =\nPhosphorus. For this reason, the claim that rigidity presents\npropositions that are necessarily true and a posteriori might be\ndisputed (Soames 2002, pp. 240, 243; Salmon 1986, pp. 133–42;\nFitch 1976; for further discussion, see Fitch 2004, pp. 110–13;\nHughes 2004, pp.\n 84–108).[14] \nSo it is controversial, though common, to say that rigidity assures\nthat the proposition Hesperus = Phosphorus is necessarily\ntrue and a posteriori. On the other hand, it may be less problematic\nor less controversial to say that rigidity assures that the\nsentence or statement (interpreted sentence)\n‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’ is necessarily true even though we\ncan find this out only a posteriori (Fitch 2004, pp. 110–13;\nHughes 2004, pp. 106–7; cf. Kripke 1980, pp. 20–1). If it\nis tenable to say that rigidity assures that some sentences\nor statements like this are necessarily true though a\nposteriori, further questions immediately impose themselves. Here is a\nsalient question: Does the aposteriority that characterizes the\nnecessarily true statements retain its epistemological significance\nand surprise, given that it is associated with statements rather than\npropositions? The question carries some importance in view of the\npopularity of Millianism; yet despite all of the debate about the\ncorrectness of Millianism, the question has been neglected. \nHere is one challenge to the proposal that the relevant statements are\nnecessarily true and a posteriori in any interesting respect. The\nproposal apparently amounts to this: the sentence ‘Hesperus =\nPhosphorus’ is necessarily true as it is used by English\nspeakers and it is an a posteriori matter to determine that it is. But\nif this is all that the a posteriori necessity of ‘Hesperus =\nPhosphorus’ amounts to, then all necessary statements are a\nposteriori in the relevant way. So, the necessary a posteriori loses\nits interest. To find out how English speakers use any sentence at\nall, one needs an empirical look at the world. Even ‘The circle\ncannot be squared’, which is generally regarded as a priori,\nseems to come out a posteriori on the account. It is an a posteriori\nmatter to determine that ‘The circle cannot be squared’ is\nnecessarily true as used by English speakers. The reader is\ninvited to think over whether the intended position lacks interest in\nthis or other ways (there is room in the literature for\ncontributions).  \nAccording to Kripke, a proper understanding of rigidity also reveals\nthat some contingent statements are a priori. Kripke considers the\nstandard meter stick, which has been used to define the length of one\nmeter. Someone decreed that the expression ‘one meter’ is\nto be used for the unit of length of that stick, perhaps at a certain\ntime in the stick's existence. The stick, S, might not have\nbeen the length that it was at the time ‘one meter’ was\ncoined: had it been heated or cooled it might have been longer or\nshorter. As things are, it was not heated or cooled. So the sentence\n‘One meter = the length of S (at time\nt0)’ is true in the actual world but it is\nfalse in some possible worlds: it is contingently true. Yet S\nhas been used to define ‘one meter’, in the sense\nthat it fixes the reference (see above), so the definers of ‘one\nmeter’ know a priori the truth of the sentence ‘The length\none meter is instantiated by S (at time\nt0)’. The reason that the sentence is\ncontingently true is that ‘one meter’ is a rigid\ndesignator for the length one meter. ‘The length of S\n(at time t0)’ is, on the other hand, a\nnon-rigid designator for one meter; in this world it designates one\nmeter but in other worlds, those in which S is heated or\ncooled, ‘the length of S (at time\nt0)’ designates other lengths. \nThe contingent a priori has not been as widely discussed as the\nnecessary a posteriori. The introduction of the contingent a priori is\nperhaps less surprising than the introduction of the necessary a\nposteriori, in view of the plausible contingency of a priori\nstatements that philosophers all along recognized, like the plausible\ncontingency of the statement, as uttered in a context, ‘I\nexist’. Further, Kripke's examples of the contingent a priori\nare perhaps more controversial than his examples of the necessary a\nposteriori. Many dispute that the examples really are examples of the\ncontingent a priori (Donnellan 1977; Hughes 2004, pp. 84–107;\nPlantinga 1974, pp. 8–9n.; Salmon (1987–1988); cf. Oppy\n1994). And even if they are contingent and a priori, many feel they\nlack much significance. They are not “scary,” as Donnellan\nputs it (also Fitch 2004, p. 121).  On the other hand, confusions are\nlike loose threads: they sometimes work their way to apparently remote\nmaterial. Confusion about the contingent a priori can and arguably\ndoes lead to confusion and apparent paradox in unsuspected areas of\nphilosophy (an alleged example is discussed in LaPorte 2003). Kripke\n(1980, pp. 14–15) recalls that considerations about the\ncontingent a priori led in his mind to a number of clarifications\nconcerning designation, which again is hardly surprising given the\ninterconnectedness of different issues in a fabric. \nThe statements of necessity associated with rigid designation are\ninteresting from an epistemological standpoint, as just indicated.\nThey are also interesting from a metaphysical standpoint. \nRigid designation seems needed on the part of both designators if\nthere are to be true “theoretical identity statements”:\nstatements in which a designator designates by way of expressing\nexplicitly in some manner one of the designatum’s theoretically\ninteresting essences. The argument is not often put explicitly. It is\nhelpful to outline explicitly the line of reasoning in order to bring\nout more clearly what stands or falls with rigidity. \nNot all identity statements widely accepted as necessary specify a\ntheoretically interesting essence in the relevant respect.\n‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’ or ‘Cicero = Tully’ do\nnot; each sentence contains only names for an object. But take, on the\nother hand, ‘Cicero = the organism descended from sperm\ns and egg e’, where ‘s’\nand ‘e’ are names for the right sperm and egg.\nMany regard this sentence as necessarily true and revealing of a\ntheoretical essence of Cicero: roughly, a theoretically interesting\nproperty possessed by Cicero in all possible worlds and never\npossessed by anyone else (see note\n 4; bear in mind, for this example, limited demands of weak necessity:  see §1.2).\n In order for any identity statement to be true of necessity, both\ndesignators must be rigid if either is. And if ‘the organism\ndescended from sperm s and egg e’ indeed\nexpresses an essence of Cicero, it must designate just Cicero in all\npossible worlds, and hence rigidly: so, given that the statement at\nissue is necessarily true, ‘Cicero’ must be rigid, too.\nAlternatively, if ‘Cicero’ is rigid, as is widely\nacknowledged, then in order for the statement at issue to be\nnecessarily true, ‘the organism descended from sperm s\nand egg e’ must be rigid and so express an essence of\nCicero. \nThe foregoing paragraphs address a line of reasoning according to\nwhich rigid designation is needed for certain statements to come out\nnecessarily true. Usually, rigidity is discussed with a view not to\nits being necessary for the completion of a job but rather\nwith a view to its being sufficient for the completion of a\njob. The rigid designation of both designators flanking an identity\nsign in a true theoretical identity statement is sufficient to\nestablish the necessity of the statement. If we acknowledge that\n‘the organism descended from sperm s and egg\ne’ is rigid, and we acknowledge that\n‘Cicero’ is rigid, then we are committed to the necessity,\nin case of truth, of ‘Cicero = the organism descended from sperm\ns and egg e’. The reasoning is parallel to\nthat given for the case of ‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’\nabove. \n‘Cicero = the organism descended from sperm s and egg\ne’ shows that statements about individuals can, in\neffect, be theoretical identity statements. The most commonly\ndiscussed theoretical identity statements concern kinds. They include\n‘Gold = the element with atomic number 79’ and\n‘Water = H2O’ (Kripke 1980, pp. 138–40,\n148). Similar reasoning might apply. Here the reasoning is again\nnearly always left implicit; one must fill in gaps to present a\ngeneral line of thought that seems to accord with a widely held, if\nnot widely articulated, tradition. For that tradition, in order for it\nto be the case that ‘Water = H2O’ is\nnecessarily true, both designators must be rigid if either is. So if\nthe statement is necessarily true and either ‘water’ is\nrigid by virtue of being a name for a substance or else\n‘H2O’ is rigid by virtue of expressing an\nessence, both designators need to be rigid. And again, the\nrigidity of designators in a true theoretical identity statement is\nsufficient for the statement's necessity. If\n‘H2O’ is a rigid designator of a substance, and\n‘water’ is a rigid designator of a substance, and\n‘Water = H2O’ is true, then that statement is\nnecessarily true. \nTheoretical identity statements are of interest across the gamut of\nphilosophy. Various writers appeal to rigid designation to support\nviews about the essences not only of kinds from chemistry or biology\nbut also kinds from philosophical subdisciplines apparently far\nremoved from empirical science: ethics and aesthetics, for example\n(see, e.g., Carney 1982; Funkhouser 2014, pp. 4, 164; Gampel 1997;\nLeddy 1987). The reader interested in pursuing any of these traditions\nshould beware that attempts to apply rigidity in the foregoing\nsubdisciplines, especially early attempts, sometimes confuse rigidity\nwith other phenomena recognized by popular theories of reference: see\nclarifications in section 2.2.  \nBy far, the most attention concerning theoretical identity statements\nhas focused on the area of philosophy of mind. That is next on the\nagenda. \nKripke appeals to rigid designation in arguing against the\n identity theory of mind,\n which is really a constellation of theories. A broad division between\nidentity theories can be drawn between type identity theories and\ntoken identity theories: here is a standard Kripkean argument against\ntoken identity theories, which are often thought to be more compelling\nthan type identity theories. Kripke is typically understood to put\nforward something like this argument.  \nSome premises in this bare-bones argument are in obvious need of\nsupport, like the modal intuition that P and C could\nhave existed each in the absence of the other. Support has been\nprovided and rejected by different writers. Many philosophers who\nreject anti-materialist arguments along these lines nevertheless make\nuse of rigid designation as a resource in order to frame\nmaterialist views that recognize a parallel between\n‘P = C’ and ‘Water =\nH2O’. \nKripke's views concerning the philosophy of mind could hardly be\ncalled popular. But, as the introduction to an edited volume covering\nthe topic says, “Even authors who disagree with Kripke's\nfundamental picture tend to present their arguments against an\nimplicitly or explicitly Kripkean backdrop—including most of the\nauthors in this volume” (Gendler and Hawthorne 2002, p. 26), the\ncontributions to which provide a good start on the literature. \nHigh-profile two-dimensionalists often embrace the broad conclusions\nassociated with rigidity, so that those conclusions are now often\ndiscussed in connection with two-dimensionalism. The relevant\narguments from two-dimensionalists may concern the same identity\nstatements as those at issue in simpler, familiar arguments from\nrigidity: when that is the case, rigidity can typically be seen to\nplay a salient role similar to the one that it plays in the simpler,\nfamiliar arguments. Garden-variety two-dimensionalist arguments for\nthe necessary a posteriori and the contingent a priori can\nillustrate. \nConsider the contingent a priori first. According to the Kripkean\nargument from section (3.2), ‘One meter = the length of\nS (at time t0)’ is contingent but a\npriori. Recall that the length of S (at time\nt0) is determined by temperature, in part, and\nthat in a hotter or colder world it would have differed.\n‘One meter = the length of S (at time\nt0)’ is true at our temperate world, but\nfalse in counterfactual worlds that are hotter and colder, since\n‘the length of S (at time\nt0)’ has a different value at those worlds\nbut ‘one meter’ has the same value, being rigid for the\nlength that, as it happens, the stick instantiates at time\nt0. The contingency of the statement can be\nrepresented in a one-dimensional diagram like that below: three worlds\ndiffering in truth value are represented horizontally and below them\nare the respective truth values (ignore the bottom two rows and the\ninformation at the far left). \nTable 1 \nBut even if one is convinced by Kripke that the content of the\nsentence that Kripke discusses is contingent and a priori, one might\nhave the sense that something is necessary, too. This suggests that\nthere might be more than one semantic value for ‘one\nmeter’ and the above sentence containing it. If there is more\nthan one semantic value, then the diagram could be filled out to\ncapture another value—or, potentially, more: so a different line\nof thinking than the foregoing, but again according to which there are\ntwo values for an expression, is the Dummettion line of reasoning from\nsection (2.3.2), which recognizes ingredient sense and assertoric\ncontent. An enriched, two-dimensional diagram might capture both of\nthese, as well as any number of other suggestions for differentiating\napparently distinct semantic values. (Indeed, you might say with\nYalcin [2014 §2.2] that assertoric content itself breaks down\nmanifoldly.)  \nHere is a garden-variety way of developing the suggestion that the\nrelevant sentence has more than one kind of semantic value. Take the\nhorizontal row at the top of the diagram to represent worlds as we\nconsider them counterfactually (or, in the case of the actual world,\nfactually) from the actual world. Take the column on the far left to\nrepresent worlds that could, in some sense, “turn out” to\nbe actual: when we consider any of these worlds w, we\nconsider the value of the sentence at various counterfactual or\nfactual worlds represented horizontally, given that our world turns\nout to be w. Thus, should the temperate world turn out to be\nactual, as it has, then the sentence ‘One meter = the\nlength of S (at time t0)’ would be\ntrue in the temperate world, but false at the counterfactual hot world\nand cold world, where the temperature alters the length of the stick:\nthe top row of ‘T’s and\n‘F’s indicates this. The next row, which\nis not completely filled out, indicates that should the hot world turn\nout to be actual, the sentence ‘One meter = the length\nof S (at time t0)’ is true at that\nworld. Here it is assumed that the ceremony is still performed on the\nstick in similar fashion: suppose that dubbers would not have chosen\nanother stick to serve as a standard because the difference of length\nis so subtle that it could be detected only with technology that\nbecame available after the baptism. The final row indicates that\nshould the cold world turn out to be actual, the sentence\n‘One meter = the length of S (at time\nt0)’ is true at that world. \nA little reflection indicates that the missing truth-value indicators\nin the diagram are all ‘F’s. For example,\nif the cold world turns out to be actual, then the sentence\n‘One meter = the length of S (at time\nt0)’ is true at that world, as the diagram\nindicates. From the perspective of the cold world, or on the\nassumption that that world is actual, the expression ‘one\nmeter’ rigidly designates some length l, which is the\nlength of S at that world, but which is a little shorter than\nthe length of S at the warmer worlds. Since at the warmer\nworlds, the length of S is longer than l, even\nthough ‘one meter’ is rigid for l, again from the\nperspective of the cold world, the sentence is false at the warmer\nworlds, considered from the perspective of the cold world. So there\nshould be a couple of ‘F’s to the left of\nthe ‘T’ in the last row. Something\nsimilar can be said for the middle row. \nThe sentence has more than one intension, or function from worlds to\ntruth values, given the two dimensions. There is not only the\none-dimensional intension that Kripke recognizes (which corresponds to\nChalmers’ secondary intension: 1996, p. 57; Jackson's\nC-intension: 1998, pp. 48-52; and otherwise-labeled\nintensions for others, e.g., Davies and Humberstone: 1980; see also\nDavies 2004, p. 87; Stalnaker 1978); there are other intensions,\nincluding that depicted in the diagonal string of\n‘T’s (Chalmers’ primary intension;\nJackson's A-intension, and again otherwise-labeled intensions for\nothers). The diagonal string of ‘T’s\nindicates that something about the content of the relevant sentence is\nnecessarily true. We might say that the sentence is “deeply\nnecessary,” adapting similar use by Evans (1979), as Evans is\nfamously interpreted by Davies and Humberstone (1980; for a more\nextended discussion that is clear, see Soames 2005, chap 6).\nCorrespondingly, we might say that the sentence is only\n“superficially contingent.” What is necessarily true might\nbe the epistemic content, the thought, the “meaning” in\nsome intuitive sense that differs from the semantic value captured by\nthe horizontal dimension, or something else. \nA similar diagram might make perspicuous the aposteriority of\n‘Water = H2O’. We may compare that sentence\nwith ‘Watery stuff = wet, drinkable … stuff’, where\n‘watery stuff’ just means stuff that is wet, drinkable\n…. The relevant statements are assigned a truth value,\nwhich might be thought of as a statement's extension. The key\ndesignators are also assigned an extension, which may be understood\nhere as that to which they apply, as ‘watery stuff’\napplies to H2O in w1. \nTable 2 \nThe top horizontal row of ‘T’s indicates\nthat ‘Water = H2O’ is necessary. The diagonal\nruns T–F for ‘Water =\nH2O’. According to a standard version of\ntwo-dimensionalism, this indicates that the content of the statement\nis not a\n priori.[15]\n Compare ‘Watery stuff = wet, drinkable … stuff’.\nThis is a priori, as well as necessary. ‘Watery stuff’\njust is a designator for stuff that is wet, drinkable, and so on. \nThese two-dimensionalist arguments for the contingent a priori and the\nnecessary a posteriori appear to make implicit use of rigidity. The\nhorizontal intension of ‘water’, ‘one meter’,\nand the like plays a crucial role in the respective arguments for the\nstatus of sentences containing these terms as necessary a posteriori\nor contingent a priori. But the horizontal intension plays this\ncrucial role by way of indicating rigidity or the lack thereof for the\nrespective\n terms.[16]\n Thus, for example, every box along the relevant horizontal row in the\ndiagram associates ‘water’ with H2O, which\nseems (as Chalmers observes: 1996, p. 132) to be a kind or property\nfound at the different worlds. If, even so, ‘water’\nfails to be a rigid designator for H2O because it\ndoes not apply to matter that is H2O with respect\nto some metaphysically possible worlds that are missing from the\ncompleted diagram, then the completed diagram can not be trusted, in\nthe way that it is supposed to be trusted, to indicate the\nmetaphysical necessity of ‘Water = H2O’: so the\ndiagram can not be trusted, in the way that it is supposed to be\ntrusted, to indicate that statement's status as necessary but a\nposteriori. \nFurther, two-dimensionalist arguments might make natural use of\n“diagonal rigidity,” as suggested already, in effect, in\nconnection with non-alethic interpretations of rigidity. Thus, one\nmight say that ‘water’ is a horizontally rigid but not a\ndiagonally rigid designator for H2O;\n‘H2O’ is both a horizontally rigid and a\ndiagonally rigid designator for H2O. If both designators in\nan identity statement rigidly designate the same entity horizontally,\nthen the statement is necessarily true (under an alethic\ninterpretation), as ‘Water = H2O’ is. If both\ndesignators rigidly designate the same entity diagonally,\nthen the statement is a priori, as ‘Watery stuff = wet,\ndrinkable … stuff’ is, or as ‘H2O =\nH2O’ is. However, if one designator in a true\nidentity statement but not the other rigidly designates an entity like\nH2O diagonally, then the statement is a posteriori, as\n‘Water = H2O’ is. In this way\ntwo-dimensionalist lines of thinking might be expressed naturally by\nappeal to\n rigidity.[17]  \nThese arguments, which address the necessary a posteriori status of\n‘Water = H2O’ and the contingent a priori\nstatus of ‘One meter = the length of S (at\ntime t0)’, concern identity statements.\nNeither Kripke nor anyone else discusses the importance of rigidity\nfor non-identity statements, which introduce complications. Although\nthe Kripkean antimaterialist argument discussed in this entry\naddresses an identity statement, ‘P =\nC’, and accordingly uses rigidity to establish that\nstatement's falsity, the famous two-dimensionalist arguments against\nmaterialism that have received so much attention since the publication\nof Chalmers' powerful The Conscious Mind (1996) address\nstatements concerning supervenience or constitution, not identity.\nAccordingly, the work performed by rigidity is less clear. It would\nseem even so that rigidity is at work in securing various\nclaims about the modal status of statements about constitution, and\nnot just claims about the modal status of statements about identity.\nThus, we might argue for the necessity of the statement, ‘If\nDavid exists, then David is constituted by the clay Lumpl’ (see\nbelow): but if ‘David’ and ‘Lumpl’ are\nnonrigid shorthand for descriptions like ‘the statue in the\ncorner’ and ‘the clay that Kim bought last week’,\nthen the alleged necessity cannot obtain, since ‘If the statue\nin the corner exists, then the statue in the corner is constituted by\nthe clay that Kim bought last week’ is not true with respect to\nevery possible world. The reader might take up the task of determining\nhow much work rigidity plays in well-known two-dimensionalist\nantimaterialist arguments concerning constitution. Two-dimensionalists\nfrequently avoid making salient appeals to rigidity (Chalmers 1996, p.\n149, p. 374n.26; cf., by contrast, the two-dimensionalist argument\ndiscussed by Gendler and Hawthorne 2002, pp. 54–55), but of\ncourse rigidity might for all that be doing important work in the\nbackground.  \nVarious objections to the coherence or usefulness of rigidity have\nbeen put forward by specialists in the philosophy of language, though\nthe objections do not seem to have done much to damage the widespread\nappeal of rigidity, which is commonly taken for granted in mainstream\nliterature from various areas of philosophy. (Whether your typical\nphilosopher is entitled to embrace rigidity is another\nmatter: so there is a case for saying, on grounds independent from the\nforegoing objections, that rigidity and the necessity accompanying it\nstand or fall with a robust version of the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction (see\n note 6).\n If that case is solid, then either popular Quinean antagonism toward\nanalyticity should prompt the rejection of rigidity or else the appeal\nof rigidity should prompt the rejection of the familiar antagonism\ntoward analyticity.) What resistance to rigidity there is may be\naddressed in general terms first, in order to save for its own\nsubsection\n (§4.2)\n treatment of objections specifically directed at the application of\nrigidity to terms for properties, which are especially contended. \nThere are various arguments against the coherence or applicability of\nrigidity with respect even to concrete object designators (for\ndiscussion, see Fitch 2004, pp. 102–10), but there is relative\ncalm. As Hughes says, the position “that proper names are rigid,\nand that identity statements involving only proper names are\naccordingly necessarily true or necessarily false,” is “as\nclose to uncontroversial as any interesting views in analytic\nphilosophy” (2004, p. vii).  \nStill, in saying that rigidity is widely favored, we should be\nprepared to qualify in view of those I've called “serious\ncounterpart theorists,” who must adopt a revisionist\nunderstanding of what it is for a designator to designate\n“rigidly” (or alternatively, they can just frame their\nposition as a rejection of rigidity: e.g., Varzi 2003, already\nquoted). Usually, counterpart theorists are motivated by objections to\nsome of the necessity that rigidity secures, according to the usual\nunderstanding. It appears to some (e.g., Gibbard 1975) that not all\nidentity statements containing just names are necessarily true.\nConsider this scenario: you mold one chunk of clay into the top half\nof a statue, and another chunk of clay into the bottom half. You stick\nthe halves together, thus bringing into existence both a statue, call\nit ‘David’, and a large lump of clay, call it\n‘Lumpl’. Suppose, next, that you explode the statue: both\nDavid and Lumpl go out of existence. It is tempting to say that\n‘David = Lumpl’ is true, but not necessarily true. It\ncould have been that: David exists and Lumpl exists but ‘David\n≠ Lumpl’ is true. This would have been the case had Lumpl\nsurvived David: e.g., had you squeezed the clay statue into a ball,\nthereby changing the shape of the relevant lump of clay, instead of\nexploding it, thereby bringing an end to the lump of clay. \nIf both ‘David’ and ‘Lumpl’ are rigid\ndesignators, then ‘David = Lumpl’ is necessarily true\nif it is true in any possible world at all. So, if it is even possible\nthat David ≠ Lumpl, then David ≠ Lumpl. David and Lumpl are\ndistinct, however intimately related, because they have different\nmodal properties: Lumpl could instantiate ballhood, while David could\nnot. The rigidity of ‘David’ and ‘Lumpl’\nevidently requires as much. In order to say that ‘David =\nLumpl’ is contingently true, Gibbard gives up the thesis that\n‘David’ and ‘Lumpl’ are rigid designators in\nthe usual respect. He maintains that designators are\n“rigid,” very loosely speaking, only with respect to a\nsortal: ‘David’ is statue-rigid, always referring to the\nsame statue, while ‘Lumpl’ is lump-rigid, always referring\nto the same lump. Accordingly, ‘Possibly, David is no\nstatue’ is false, while ‘Possibly, Lumpl is no\nstatue’ is true. What about the object that is, as a\nmatter of fact, both a statue and a lump? For Gibbard, objects have no\nmodal properties and it makes no sense to say that an object in some\nother possible world is identical to an object in the actual world.\nThis is counterintuitive, but again Gibbard does offer a non-standard\nsemantics to accommodate modal talk. \nDavid Lewis (1986, chap 4) offers a similar strategy for maintaining\nthat ‘Possibly, David is no statue’ is false, while\n‘Possibly, Lumpl is no statue’ is true. For Lewis, what\nmakes a sentence like the above true or false is whether counterparts\nin other possible worlds associated with ‘David’ or\n‘Lumpl’ are all statues. The use, in discourse, of\ndifferent names like ‘David’ and ‘Lumpl’ can\ncreate different contexts, thus altering the counterparts that come\ninto play in determining the truth of sentences containing the names.\nThe sentences ‘Possibly, David is no statue’ and\n‘Possibly, Lumpl is no statue’ can vary in truth value\nbecause the counterparts relevant to the truth value of the former\nsentence are all statues but the counterparts relevant to the truth\nvalue of the latter sentence are not. \nOrthodox rigidity proponents who distinguish between the referents of\n‘David’ and ‘Lumpl’ say that there is more\nthan one object at the same place and time where the statue stands.\nThe intimate relationship between David and Lumpl is usually\nunderstood as one of constitution: David is constituted by\nLumpl. Constitution has been championed by various philosophers to\naddress a variety of related issues (see, e.g., Baker 2000 on personal\nidentity). \nAnother possibility, which avoids commitment to constitution, is to\nmaintain an eliminativism about statues or clay lumps. One might\nmaintain that there is no real entity to name “David,” in\nthe way that the story above requires; there is only Lumpl in a\nstatuesque form. Accordingly, the problem of accounting for the modal\nstatus of a sentence to which ‘David’ contributes, like\n‘David = Lumpl’, never arises. (For an appeal to\neliminativism to handle various candidates for constitution, see Fitch\n2001, pp. 382–3, 391n.5; Hershenov 2005; Merricks 2001.) In\norder to work as a general alternative approach, eliminativism would\nhave to work for all of a wide variety of would-be cases of\nconstitution. \nNotice that the unintuitive idea that more than one object can exist\nin the same place at the same time is not necessarily removed if we\naccept contingent identity. Gibbard, for example, acknowledges that\nLumpl and David are distinct objects in any world w in which\nDavid but not Lumpl comes to an end by being squeezed into a ball; but\ndespite the failure of identity to hold between David and Lumpl in\nw, the two share one spatiotemporal location before\nDavid is destroyed because the material of the clay lump that is Lumpl\nis precisely the material of David. \nOne good collection of papers on this topic is Rea (1997), and one\ngood introduction is his “Introduction.” \nBoth Kripke (1980) and Putnam (1975) famously extend the notion of\nrigidity to terms for natural kinds. Here controversy has\nensued. Let us begin with a singular term as an example; general terms\nintroduce additional complications (for discussion, see Linsky 1984;\nSoames 2002; Salmon 2003; 2005). \nWhat is rigidly designated by a kind term like ‘Apis\nmellifera’? Apparently it can not rigidly designate a\nscattered object comprised of all particular honeybees, say, since\nthose honeybees that presently go about their work might not have\nexisted. And others that do not exist might have existed instead (but\ncontroversy and complications attend this observation: see, e.g.,\nGómez-Torrente 2006; Zouhar 2009, p. 211). To be rigid, a term\nhas to designate the same thing in all possible worlds. \nSome philosophers have proposed that ‘Apis\nmellifera’ rigidly designates an abstract object, a kind or\nproperty. One might say that ‘Apis mellifera’\ndesignates the honeybee kind in every possible world: it\nnever designates any other kind, like the bumblebee kind, say. That\nmight be said to make the term rigid. Something similar could be said\nfor ‘water’, ‘heat’, and\n‘redness’. But a number of objections have been\nissued. \nOne broad sort of objection, if it should be called that, is that\nrigidity does, in some respect, the work attributed to it; but\nrigidity is superfluous to the task of explaining that work because\nthe work is the result of other, more fundamental phenomena (for\ndifferent approaches along these lines, see Jylkkä 2008, pp.\n69-72; Schwartz 2002; Soames 2002, e.g., pp. 310–11). This\nobjection has been discussed in the context of a treatment of property\ndesignators, but it might be raised with respect to the rigidity of\nany term at\n all.[18] \n  \nAn objection more specifically directed toward efforts at extending\nrigidity to expressions for just kinds and properties, is that such\nefforts would also have to extend the status of rigidity to terms for\nartificial kinds or properties (see, e.g., Glüer and Pagin\n2011; Haukioja 2012; Schwartz 2002; whether this vast application of rigidity should be thought problematic might be questioned:  see e.g., Salmon 2005). The singular terms ‘soda\npop’, ‘bachelorhood’, ‘livestock’ and so\non, would also seem to designate an abstract object rigidly (soda\npop, bachelorhood, livestock, respectively), if terms for natural\nkinds and natural properties do so. So the foregoing proposal for the\nrigidity of kind and property terms might be thought to be too\nindiscriminate in what it allows to be rigid—maybe even so\nindiscriminate that it mistakes sameness of meaning across\npossible worlds, which every meaningful expression enjoys, for\nsameness of designation, which only rigid designators are\nsupposed to have (Schwartz 2002, p. 272).  \nThe basic objection here to our counting certain singular terms\nto be rigid designators for properties might also tell against\ncounting certain general terms to be rigid designators. The\nthesis under fire is that according to which certain general terms\nrigidly designate properties, by virtue of designating the right\nproperty in every possible world. So according to this thesis,\n‘watery’, like its singular variant ‘water’,\nis rigid by virtue of designating water with respect to every possible\nworld: and something similar can be said for ‘honeybee’,\n‘hot’, and ‘green’. Again, the relevant\nobjection would be that if the foregoing general terms were rigid for\nthat reason, then something similar could be said for general terms\nthat cut more artificially, like ‘bachelor’; and that is\nsupposed to be a problem.  \nA second group of objections to extending rigid status to expressions\nfor properties specifically (just tacitly include kinds with\nproperties—kinds are often counted as a sort of property)\ncenters around the idea that the proposal seems committed to\nsubstantive metaphysical positions about abstract objects like kinds\nor properties, concerning which a theory of language ought to remain\nneutral (Devitt 2005; Haukioja 2006; Martí 1998, p. 487). For\nexample, the proposal seems committed to rejecting nominalism. Some\ndefenders of property terms' rigidity are happy so to commit (Linsky\n1984). Other defenders of property terms' rigidity seek ways of\naccommodating nominalism (Martí 1998).  \nEven if we are happy to commit to properties, problems remain. Just as\na paucity of properties can create problems (nominalism), so can a\nplenum of properties. We’ve already seen that expressions for\nartificial kinds and properties like ‘livestock’ might\ncreate troubles. There’s a different sort of problem raised by\nstill-more artificial properties: a worry arises that allegedly\nnon-rigid designators for properties always end up rigidly\ndesignating some gruesome relational property or other in the plenum.\nConsider ‘the biological species typically farmed for\nhoney’, which we might initially be inclined to take for a\nnonrigid designator of Apis mellifera. “In virtue of\nwhat,” as Devitt would ask (2005, p. 154; see also 2009, p.\n240), does such an expression “nonrigidly designate that,”\ni.e., Apis mellifera, rather than rigidly designate the property\nbeing the biological species typically farmed for honey? This\nproblem has been much discussed. Whether indeed there is a problem\nhere might depend on whether expressions for properties are singular\nterms or whether they are predicative. Arguably the problem is more\ntractable for singular terms than for thoroughly predicative terms,\nwhich seem especially unaccommodating.  \nFor related reasons, most workers reject any rigid–nonrigid\ndistinction for purely predicative expressions. That would include\n‘green’ and ‘honeybee’, on a\nnominalist’s approach according to which there is no property to\ndesignate and on some realist approaches, too, such as a Fregean\napproach according to which properties exist but cannot be named.\nOther still-more widely accepted candidates for purely predicative\nstatus would be the predicates ‘is green’, and ‘is a\nhoneybee’.  \n‘Green’ and ‘honeybee’ are weaker candidates\nfor purely predicative status than are predicates containing them,\nbecause according to a now-popular view, ‘green’ or\n‘honeybee’ is “singular” in a broad\nsense. That popular view recognizes a “‘singular\noccurrence’ of a general term” like ‘green’\n(Inan 2008, p.227), so that those holding the view do not count\n‘green’ to be “purely predicative” in the\nstrict respect of the foregoing paragraph, even though they might for\nall that count the containing expression ‘...is green’ as\npurely predicative (e.g., Soames counts\n‘green’/‘...is green’ as singular/predicative\nrespectively), and such theorists might accordingly apply the\nrigid–nonrigid distinction to the singular ‘green’\nbut not to ‘...is green’ (Soames 2010, pp. 90-91; 2006, p.\n712; see also Robertson 2009, p. 136n.23).  \nHow could ‘green’, a general term, have singular status\ntoo? According to the most commonly cited (but not the only)\nsuggestion along these lines, although general terms are not\nfirst-order singular terms—on the contrary, they’re\ngeneral terms precisely by virtue of being first-order\ngeneral terms—they are higher-order singular terms\n(Linsky 1984; Salmon 2003; 2005).  \nA few workers maintain both that there are purely predicative general\nterms and that some of them, like ‘honeybee’, are rigid.\nAccording to a now-familiar suggestion along these lines, what makes\nthe application of a general term F rigid is that any item x to\nwhich the term applies, in any possible world, is part of the\nextension of F in all worlds in which x exists, x\nbeing an F essentially (Cook 1980; Devitt 2005; Devitt and\nSterelny 1999, pp. 85–6; Gómez-Torrente 2006). This\nnotion of rigid application might hold some attraction for someone\nbothered by the objections just mentioned against the view that terms\nrigidly designate properties. It would appear that terms for natural\nkinds but not artificial ones come out rigid: thus,\n‘honeybee’ is rigid because any particular honeybee is\nessentially a honeybee and could not have been something else like a\ndragonfly or a fir tree instead. But ‘livestock’ does not\napply rigidly according to this account because animals that are\nlivestock are not essentially so. Neither does ‘(is a member of\nthe-/the-) species typically farmed for honey’ apply rigidly\naccording to this account. Furthermore, the account appears to be open\nto nominalism (about properties): nominalists recognize the legitimate\napplication of general terms.  \nHowever, even if rigid application evades the above difficulties, it\nhas its limitations. One commonly noted problem is this: consider\nidentity statements like ‘Water = H2O’, or ‘Red\nlight = light with wavelength 680 nm’. Rigidity is apparently\nsupposed to guarantee the necessity, in case of truth, of identity\nstatements like these. Typically, fans of rigid application rewrite\nidentity statements to have this form: ‘Anything is (an)\nF if and only if it is (an) F′’. But many\nphilosophers, including proponents of rigid application, have pointed\nout that it could be the case for two general terms F and F′\nthat, (i) necessarily, every F is essentially F and\nevery F′ is essentially F′, so that F and\nF′ are rigid appliers and (ii) in the actual world,\n‘Anything is F if and only if it is F′’ is true,\neven though (iii) God might have created an F that is not an\nF′. In that event, ‘Anything is F if and\nonly if it is F′’ comes out true with respect to\nthe actual world but not necessarily true (for an attempt to get\naround this difficulty, see Gómez-Torrente 2006). \nApart from the foregoing minority suggestion of tying essentialism to\nrigidity, there has not been much done by way of articulating any\npurely predicative version of rigidity; again, prospects for any such\naccount are generally thought to be grim. There is however at least\none rival account of predicative rigidity to compete with the\nforegoing essentialism-centered account of predicative rigidity. The\nproposal follows a lead from Fregeans who recognize “definite\nascriptions” (Heintz 1973) for properties corresponding to\ndefinite descriptions for entities they are willing to name. Thus,\nGeach indicates that he would recognize a proper answer to the\nquestion “what is the color of Antarctica?” to be\n“clouds, snow, etc.,” or that an English statement like\nthe following is unobjectionable: “Honeybees are the species\ntypically farmed for honey.” In sentences like the\nforegoing, seemingly singular talk about an abstract entity, such as a\n“color” or a “species,” would have to be\ninterpreted as talk about concrete objects instead: clouds,\nbees, etc. (see, e.g., Anscombe and Geach 1961, pp. 155–6). Let\nus suppose, for the sake of argument, that expressions like\n‘white’ and ‘the color of Antarctica’ are\npurely predicative, either because there are no properties to\ndesignate or because they cannot be designated by a singular\nexpression: still, the contrast between a typical one-word\npredicate like ‘white’ and the foregoing definite\nascription remains of interest for its bearing on the modal and\nepistemological status of biconditionals, in the ways relevant to\nrigidity, according to this line of thinking: compare ‘Something\nis the color of Antarctica if and only if it is white’ with\n‘Something is albescent if and only if it is white’\n(understand ‘albescent’ as a synonym for\n‘white’). That contrast suggests that we might articulate\nan account of rigidity that does not presuppose singular designation\nof any sort (LaPorte 2013, chapter 5 develops this suggestion and\ncontains as well further references and discussion of the various\nother positions discussed in §4.2).","contact.mail":"jlaporte@hope.edu","contact.domain":"hope.edu"}]
