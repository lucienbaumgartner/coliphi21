He is\nknown principally for offering a highly original synthesis of the views\nof his intellectual heroes, St. Augustine and René Descartes.\nTwo distinctive results of this synthesis are Malebranche’s doctrine\nthat we see bodies through ideas in God and his occasionalist\nconclusion that God is the only real cause.\n\n\n\nMalebranche was born in Paris on August 6, 1638, one month prior to\nLouis XIV, and died, also in Paris, on October 13, 1715, six weeks\nafter the great French monarch. Malebranche was one of many children\nborn to his mother, Catherine de Lauzon, the sister of a Viceroy of\nCanada, and his father, also Nicolas Malebranche, a secretary to Louis\nXIII. As in the case of Descartes and Pascal, Malebranche was born in\nfrail health. His particular affliction was a severe malformation of\nthe spine, and due to this condition as well as his weak lungs he\nneeded to be tutored at home until the age of sixteen. Subsequently he\nwas a student at the Collège de la Marche, and after graduating\nhe went to study theology at the Sorbonne. His education left him with\na distaste for a scholasticism that focused on the work of Aristotle.\nThus, in 1660 he decided to leave the universities and to enter the\nOratory, a religious congregation founded in 1611 by the Augustinian\ntheologian Pierre Bérulle (1575–1629). At the Oratory in Paris,\nMalebranche studied ecclesiastical history, linguistics, and the Bible,\nand with his fellow students also immersed himself in the work of\nAugustine. He was ordained a priest on September 14, 1664. \n\nThere is the story that in the same year in which he was ordained,\nMalebranche happened in a Paris bookstall upon a posthumous edition of\nDescartes’s Traité de l’homme (Treatise on\nMan) which provides a sketch of a mechanistic account of the\nphysiology of the human body. Malebranche’s early biographer, Father\nYves André, reported that he was so “ecstatic” on\nreading this account that he experienced “such violent\npalpitations of the heart that he was obliged to leave his book at\nfrequent intervals, and to interrupt his reading of it in order to\nbreathe more easily” (André 1886, 11–12).  While\nAndré does not indicate why Malebranche was so moved, one can\nspeculate that he had discovered in this text a way to investigate the\nnatural world without relying on a stagnant Aristotelian\nscholasticism. In any case, after his encounter with L’homme\nMalebranche devoted himself to a decade-long study of the Cartesian\nmethod and its results in mathematics and natural philosophy. \n\nThe fruit of this study is a two-volume work bearing the title,\nDe la recherche de la vérité. Où l’on traitte\nde la nature de l’esprit de l’homme, et de l’usage qu’il en doit faire\npour eviter l’erreur dans les sciences (Search after Truth. In\nwhich is treated the nature of the human mind and the use that must be\nmade of it to avoid error in the sciences ) (1674–75). It is\nprimarily this text which provides the basis for Malebranche’s\nreputation in the modern period. As its full title indicates, the\nRecherche focuses on the principal sources of human error and\non the method for avoiding those errors and for finding the truth. The\nfirst five books enumerate the various errors deriving from the senses,\nimagination, pure understanding, inclinations and passions,\nrespectively, and a sixth book is devoted to the Cartesian method of\navoiding such errors through attention to clear and distinct ideas. The\ncenterpiece of the third book, on pure understanding, is a defense of\nthe claim that the ideas through which we perceive bodies exist in God.\nTucked away in the final book, on method, is a critique of “the\nmost dangerous error of the ancients,” namely, the Aristotelian\nposition that there are secondary causes in nature distinct from\nGod. \n\nThe first volume of the Recherche, containing the first\nthree books, drew an immediate response in 1675 from the abbé\nSimon Foucher (1644–1696), canon of Sainte Chapelle of Dijon. Foucher\nwas an “academic skeptic” who attacked the assumption that\nideas in us can represent objects distinct from us (see Foucher 1675).\nThe Cartesian Benedictine Robert Desgabets (1610–1678) replied to\nFoucher by insisting that the Cartesian rule that clear and distinct\nideas are true presupposes that our thoughts correspond to real\nexternal objects. In brief prefaces added to the second volume of the\nRecherche, Malebranche chastised both thinkers for failing to\nread the work they were discussing, noting in particular that he had\nexplicitly argued in the Recherche that the ideas we perceive\nexist in God rather than in us. \n\nMalebranche solicited written responses to the Recherche\nmodeled on the sets of objections published with Descartes’s\nMeditations. Perhaps put off by Malebranche’s harsh treatment\nof Foucher and Desgabets, his critics offered instead only informal\nobjections channeled through mutual friends. In 1678, Malebranche\nappended to the Recherche a set of sixteen\nEclaircissements, or clarifications, that respond to these\nobjections. Among the more important objections addressed are those\nthat concern Malebranche’s assertion that we have a freedom to\n“consent” to certain motives for action\n(“Eclaircissement I”), his claim that reason provides no\nconclusive demonstration of the existence of the material world\n(“Eclaircissement VI”), his doctrine of the vision of\nideas in God (“Eclaircissement X”), his conclusion that we\nknow our own soul through a confused consciousness rather than through\na clear idea of its nature (“Eclaircissement XI”), and his\noccasionalist thesis that God is the only true cause\n(“Eclaircissement XV”). The final 1712 edition includes\nthe addition of a seventeenth Eclaircissement that defends the\nimportance “not only for knowledge of nature but also for\nknowledge of religion and morals” of the view, only hinted at in\nthe initial edition of the Recherche, that God acts for the\nmost part through “general volitions” (volontez\ngénérales) and acts though “particular\nvolitions” (volontez particulières) only in the\nexceptional case of miracles. \n\nMalebranche developed this last point in his 1680 Traité de\nla nature et de la grâce (Treatise on Nature and\nGrace). He published this work over the objections of the\nJansenist theologian and Cartesian philosopher Antoine Arnauld\n(1612–1694), who was disturbed by what he saw as\nMalebranche’s denial of the assertion in the Scriptures and the\ntradition of God’s attention to particular details in matters of\ngrace. Arnauld responded to the publication of Nature et\ngrâce by engaging in open combat, and the ensuing battle\nbecame one of the major intellectual events of the day. His opening\nsalvo was the 1683 Des vraies et des fausses idées\n(On True and False Ideas), which attacks not Nature et\ngrâce but rather the\nRecherche (see Arnauld 1683). Arnauld’s strategy here was to\nundermine Malebranche’s influence in theological matters by revealing\nthe inadequacy of his philosophical views. In particular, he attacked\nMalebranche’s assumption that ideas are “representative\nbeings” distinct from our perceptions, offering instead the\nposition, which he plausibly ascribed to Descartes, that ideas are\nsimply a feature of the perceptual modifications of our soul. This\nargument reflects a sympathy for Descartes’ views that dates back to\nArnauld’s set of comments on the Meditations. \n\nThe same year that Arnauld presented his initial critique,\nMalebranche published the Méditations chretiennes et\nmétaphysiques (Christian and Metaphysical\nMeditations), in which “the Word” (i.e., the Second\nPerson of the Trinity) offers a summary of his system that highlights\nthe central role that God plays in both metaphysics and morality. This\nwork was in some ways a follow up to his Conversations\nchrétiennes (Christian Conversations), published\nin 1677. In that earlier text, Malebranche presented a defense of the\nChristian religion that emphasizes the Augustinian theme of our\ndependence on God for knowledge and happiness. In 1684, Malebranche\nfurther developed his views on moral theory in the Traité de\nmorale (Treatise on Ethics), in which he argued that\nmoral virtue requires a love of the “immutable order” that\nGod reveals to those who seek to know it. \n\nIn 1684, Malebranche also responded to Arnauld’s\nIdées, and after a further exchange on the topic of the\nnature of ideas the debate turned to the theological issues concerning divine\nprovidence, grace and miracles. The battle became increasingly bitter,\nand as a result of a campaign on the part of Arnauld and his\nsupporters, Malebranche’s Nature et grâce was put on the\nCatholic Index librorum prohibitorum (Index of Prohibited\nBooks) in 1690 (the Recherche was added in 1709). The\nMalebranche-Arnauld polemic continued even after Arnauld’s death in\n1694, with the publication in 1704 of two letters Arnauld wrote in\n1699 and of Malebranche’s responses to those letters. \n\nIn 1688, Malebranche published his Entretiens sur la\nmétaphysique et la religion (Dialogues on Metaphysics\nand Religion), a concise summary of his main metaphysical\ndoctrines of the vision in God and occasionalism that also addresses\nthe problem of evil. In 1696, he appended to this text the\nEntretiens sur la mort (Dialogues on Death), which he\ncomposed after a life-threatening illness. \n\nIn 1692, Malebranche published a short study, the Lois de la\ncommunication des mouvements (Laws of the Communication of\nMotions), in which he endorsed Descartes’s law of the\nconservation of the quantity of motion but offered rules governing\ncollision that, unlike Descartes’s own rules, involve no appeal to a\nforce in bodies to remain at rest. In correspondence with Malebranche,\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) emphasized difficulties with\nDescartes’s conservation law, and that correspondence led Malebranche\nto insert into a 1700 edition of the Lois the admission that\nexperience reveals that such a law does not hold. \n\nIn 1693, Malebranche responded to the criticisms of the\nRecherche in the 1690 Systême de philosophie\n(System of Philosophy) of the French Cartesian Pierre-Sylvain\nRégis (1632–1707). Régis had defended an account of\nideas similar to the one that Arnauld had defended against Malebranche\nduring the 1680s, and Arnauld used the Régis-Malebranche\nexchange as an occasion to return to the issue of ideas during the\nlast year of his life. Despite their dispute, Malebranche and\nRégis were both appointed as honorary members of the Paris\nAcadémie des sciences when it was reorganized in\n1699. Malebranche presented an inaugural lecture to the\nAcadémie that defends against Descartes an account of color in\nterms of the frequency of vibrations of light. In later published\nversions of the lecture, Malebranche revised his discussion to take\ninto account the theory of the nature of color in the work of Sir\nIsaac Newton. \n\nIn 1697, Malebranche published the Traité de l’amour\nde Dieu (Treatise on the Love of God) with Trois\nlettres à Lamy (Three Letters to Lamy), in which\nhe rejected the claim in the Benedictine François Lamy\n(1636–1711) that the Traité de morale supports the\n“quietist” position that moral action derives from a disinterested\n“pure love of God.” This rejection of Lamy’s quietism\nprovided the basis for Malebranche’s reconciliation with the famous\nFrench cleric, Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet (1627–1704). Bossuet had\nearlier enlisted the aid of François de Fénelon\n(1651–1715) in writing against Malebranche’s occasionalism and his\nappeals to God’s “general will,” but later became a bitter\nenemy of Fénelon’s quietism. \n\nWith the support of the apostolic vicar in China, Malebranche\npublished in 1708 an Entretien d’un philosophe chrétien et\nd’un philosophe chinois, sur l’existence et la nature de Dieu\n(Dialogue between a Christian Philosopher and a Chinese Philosopher\non the Existence and Nature of God). A sixth and last edition of\nthe Recherche appeared in 1712, and in 1715 Malebranche\npublished his final work, Réflexions sur la prémotion\nphysique (Reflections on Physical Premotion), in which he\nresponded to the claim of the abbé Laurent-François\nBoursier (1679–1749) that occasionalism leads naturally to the\nThomistic position that God determines our action by means of a\n“physical premotion.” In his response, Malebranche defended\nthe claim, present from the first edition of the Recherche,\nthat our free action involves a “consent” that God does not\ndetermine. \n\nThe Œuvres complètes de Malebranche [OC], which\nconsists of 20 volumes, is the standard critical edition of\nMalebranche’s writings. In France, Malebranche has always been a\nmajor figure in the history of early modern philosophy, and there is\nan extensive earlier literature on him from this country; see, for\ninstance, Gouhier (1926), Gueroult (1939), Gouhier (1948), Gueroult\n(1955–59), Robinet (1955), Rodis-Lewis (1963), and Robinet\n(1965). This is supplemented by the important discussion in\nAlquié (1974), and there is a continuation of substantive\nFrench scholarship on Malebranche in works such as Moreau (1999),\nBardout (1999), Bardout (2000), and Pellgrin (2006).  Despite the\nrelative neglect of him in the corresponding Anglophone literature\nduring the earlier part of the twentieth century, Malebranche has\nbecome increasingly popular among English-language scholars more\nrecently.  This change is indicated by the presence of recent English\ntranslations of his writings; see Malebranche [DM], [DC], [TE],\n[DMR], and [ST]. More recent book-length studies of Malebranche in English\ninclude McCracken (1983), Jolley (1990), Nadler (1992), Schmaltz\n(1996), Nadler (2000), Pyle (2003), and Peppers-Bates (2009), which\nadd to earlier trail-blazing studies such as Walton (1972) and Radner\n(1978).  Easton, Lennon and Sebba (1991) is a comprehensive\nbibliography of work on Malebranche in various languages. This work\nsupersedes the bibliography in volume 20 of Malebranche [OC], which\nhad superseded Sebba (1959).  \n\nIn a section of the third book of the Recherche devoted to\n“the nature of ideas,” Malebranche argued for his famous\ndoctrine of the vision in God. More precisely, the thesis in this\nsection is that we see external objects by means of ideas in God. The\nargument for this thesis begins with the claim at the beginning of this\nsection that “everyone agrees that we do not perceive objects\nexternal to us by themselves” since it can hardly be the case\nthat “the soul should leave the body to stroll about the heavens\nto see the objects present there” (Malebranche [OC], 1:413).\nArnauld later took exception to this starting point, countering that\n“ideas, taken in the sense of representative beings, distinct\nfrom perceptions, are not needed by our soul in order to see\nbodies” (Arnauld 1683, 18). His main objection is that\nMalebranche stacked the deck in favor of his doctrine that we see ideas\nof bodies in God by assuming from the start that these ideas are\ndistinct from our own perceptions. \n\nIn developing his own position, Arnauld appealed to Descartes’\ndistinction in “Meditation III” between the formal reality\nof an idea as a perceptual modification of mind and its objective\nreality as something that represents an object. Arnauld insisted that a\nrepresentative idea is simply the objective reality of a perception,\nand thus not something distinct from that perception. However, it is\nimportant to note that Malebranche’s definition of an idea does not\nrule out such a position from the start. As he himself insisted to\nArnauld, the claim that we must perceive external objects through ideas\nleaves open the question of whether an idea is “a modality of\nthe soul, according to the opinion of M. Arnauld; an express\nspecies, according to certain philosophers, or an entity\ncreated with the soul, according to others; or finally\nintelligible extension rendered sensible by color or light,\naccording to my opinion” (Malebranche [OC], 6:95). \n\nMalebranche’s description of his own opinion goes beyond what can be\nfound in the original edition of the Recherche. However, his\ndescription of the other alternatives is drawn directly from this text.\nIn particular, Malebranche had argued there that there are only four\nalternatives to the conclusion that we see bodies through ideas in God:\n(1) Bodies transmit resembling species to the soul; (2) Our soul has\nthe power to produce ideas when triggered by non-resembling bodily\nimpression; (3) Ideas are created with the soul or produced in it\nsuccessively by God; and (4) Our soul sees both the essence and the\nexistence of bodies by considering its own perfections. Malebranche\ntold Arnauld that since this list constitutes “an exact division\n… of all the ways in which we can see objects” and since\neach of the alternative accounts yields “manifest\ncontradictions,” his argument from elimination serves to\ndemonstrate the doctrine of the vision in God (Malebranche [OC],\n6:198–99). \n\nIt is difficult to determine from the Recherche the precise\nsource of the enumeration. However, Connell (1967) has established that\nMalebranche’s argument was drawn from the account of angelic knowledge\nin the work of the Spanish scholastic, Francisco Suárez\n(1548–1617). Particularly crucial for Malebranche’s enumeration is\nSuárez’s claim that angels must know material objects through\nspecies that God adds to their mind given that God alone can know them\nthrough His own substance. In light of this claim, we can take\nMalebranche’s first three hypotheses to cover the various ways in which\nwe could perceive bodies through immaterial species\n“superadded” to our soul, and his fourth hypothesis to\ncover the possibility that we perceive bodies in the perfections of our\nsoul. In arguing against the last hypothesis, Malebranche noted that\nsince a finite being can see in itself neither the infinite nor an\ninfinite number of beings (as Suárez had argued in the case of\nangels), and since we in fact perceive both the infinite and infinity\nin external objects, it must be that we see these objects by means of\nperfections contained in the only being that can possess an infinity of\nideas, namely, God Himself. \n\nMalebranche took the conclusion here to confirm the view in\n“an infinity of passages” in Augustine that “we see\nGod” in knowing eternal truths. This appeal to the Augustinian\ntheory of divine illumination provides the basis for an argument for\nthe vision in God that bypasses the unusual enumeration in the\nRecherche. This more direct argument is introduced in\n“Eclaircissement X,” where Malebranche urged that the ideas\nwe perceive must exist in an “immutable and necessary\nReason” since they are themselves immutable and necessary\n(Malebranche [OC], 3:129f). Malebranche emphasized that the\nAugustinian view that eternal truths derive from uncreated features of\nthe divine intellect conflicts directly with the voluntarist conclusion\nin Descartes that these truths derive rather from God’s free and\nindifferent will. Particularly in his exchanges with Arnauld,\nMalebranche attempted to present his doctrine of the vision in God as a\nnatural consequence of Descartes’ account of ideas. However, his\nAugustinian argument serves to show that Descartes himself could not\nhave accepted this doctrine. Moreover, such an argument reveals the\nmost fundamental reason for Malebranche’s rejection of Arnauld’s\nCartesian identification of ideas with our own perceptions. Since\nMalebranche identified these ideas with necessary and immutable\nessences, and since he held that these ideas derive their necessity and\nimmutability from the divine intellect, he concluded that Arnauld’s\nposition can only result in a radical subjectivism that renders\nimpossible any sort of a priori knowledge of the material world. \n\n“Eclaircissement X” also introduces the notion of\n“intelligibile extension” mentioned in Malebranche’s claim\nto Arnauld quoted above concerning his own opinion.  According to this\nEclaircissement, God has a single ideal extension that serves to\nrepresent particular bodies to Him. Arnauld objected that this\nposition involves a retraction of the claim in the Recherche\nthat we perceive bodies by means of distinct ideas in God. In\nresponse, Malebranche insisted that his view all along was that God\nrepresents particular bodies by means of His own simple\n“absolute being.” For Arnauld, however, the view that God\ncontains extension in this way is objectionable since it is connected\nto the heretical view in the work of the Dutch thinker Benedict\nSpinoza that God is extended substance. The charge of Spinozism\nreappears in Malebranche’s 1713–14 correspondence with one of his\nformer students, J.J. Dortous de Mairan (1678–1771), who later became\nthe Secretary of the Académie des sciences. As in the case of\nArnauld, so in this correspondence Malebranche vigorously denied this\ncharge. In both cases, he responded by emphasizing that the infinite\nand indivisible ideal extension that exists in God differs from the\nfinite and divisible extension in the material world. (For more on\nMalebranche’s notion of intelligible extension, see Reid 2003; cf. the\ndifferent interpretation of this notion in Nolan 2012.) \n\nA final feature of Malebranche’s doctrine of the vision in God is\nconnected to the notion in his writings of the “efficacious\nidea” (idée efficace). As first noted in Robinet\n(1965), this notion became entrenched in Malebranche’s system around\n1695, after his encounter with his Cartesian critic Régis. In\nhis Systême de philosophie, Régis had challenged\nthe claim in the preface to the Recherche that our mind is\nunited to God in a manner that “raises the mind above all\nthings” and is the source of “its life, its light, and its\nentire felicity” (Malebranche [OC], 1:9). While he granted the\ncommonplace claim that God must create and conserve our soul,\nRégis denied that we are enlightened by means of a union with\nideas of bodies in God. Rather, he insisted that God conserves in us\nideas that derive directly from the bodies they represent. In the 1693\nRéponse à Régis (Response to\nRégis), Malebranche emphasized his Augustinian position\nthat we can be instructed as to the nature of bodies only through a\nunion with God. However, he put a new spin on this position when he\nnoted that the union with God involves an “affecting” or\n“touching” of our mind by God’s idea of extension. \n\nAlready in the 1688 Entretiens sur la métaphysique,\nMalebranche had suggested that the union with God can be explicated in\nterms of a causal relation between God’s ideas and our mind. After\n1695, he developed this suggestion by introducing the notion of\n“pure” or non-sensory intellectual perceptions that are\nproduced by God’s efficacious idea of extension. Yet he also stressed\nin this later period that such an idea is the causal source of our\nsensations. One advantage of this extension of the doctrine of\nefficacious ideas to sensations is that it yields a fairly clear\nexplanation of Malebranche’s claim to Arnauld that an idea is\n“intelligible extension rendered sensible by color or\nlight.” Prior to 1695, Malebranche explained how intelligible\nextension is so rendered by appealing somewhat obscurely to the fact\nthat the soul “attaches” colors to a non-sensory idea.\nHowever, the theory of efficacious ideas allowed him to say that this\nidea is rendered sensible by causing in us the appropriate sensations\nof color and light. The claim that we see ideas in God is thus\ntransformed into the claim that our soul has intellectual and sensory\nperceptions that yield an understanding of the truth concerning bodies\nin virtue of their causal relation to God’s idea of extension. Drawing\non Robinet’s results, one scholar has concluded that while Malebranche\nstarted with the vision in God, he ended with a vision\nby God (Alquié 1974, 209). \n\nMalebranche told Arnauld that it was Augustine’s authority\n“which has given me the desire to put forth the new\nphilosophy of ideas” (Malebranche [OC], 6:80). By\ncontrast, he emphasized in the preface of the Recherche that\nAugustine had failed to see that sensible qualities “are not\nclearly contained in the idea we have of matter,” adding that\n“the difference between mind and body has been known with\nsufficient clarity for only a few years” (Malebranche [OC],\n1:20). The allusion here is to Descartes’s recent discovery of an idea\nof matter that reveals that its nature consists in extension alone.\nThis idea dictates that sensible qualities such as colors, tastes and\nodors that are not reducible to modes of extension cannot exist\nexternal to mind. But since these qualities exist in the mind, and in\nparticular in the mind’s perception of the qualities, the mind itself\nmust be distinguished from body. In this way the Cartesian idea of\nmatter reveals “the difference between mind and body.” \n\nIn the initial book of the Recherche, on the senses,\nMalebranche proposed that the erroneous belief in the Aristotelians as\nwell as in Augustine that sensible qualities exist in bodies has its\nsource in a misuse of “natural judgments” that help in the\nconservation of the human body. Here he was following Descartes’\naccount in “Meditation VI” of the “teachings of\nnature,” and in particular the claim there that the purpose of\nsensations is not to teach us about the nature of bodies but simply to\ninform us of what is beneficial or harmful to the human composite. Just\nas Descartes had urged that erroneous beliefs about the nature of body\ncan be avoided by attending to the clear and distinct perceptions of\nthe intellect, so Malebranche counseled that we avoid error by\nattending to what the clear idea of matter reveals to us about the\nnature of body. As we have seen, Malebranche had Augustinian reasons\nfor saying that the idea that so instructs us exists in God. By his own\nadmission, however, the conclusion that the idea that instructs us is\nan idea of extension derives from the recent discoveries of\nDescartes. \n\nMalebranche emphasized that the clear idea of extension must be\ndistinguished from our confused sensations. One point he wanted to make\nis that the idea exists in God while the sensations are only\nmodifications of our mind. However, his emphasis on the fact that this\nidea is “pure” or non-sensory indicates that our experience\nof the material world has an intellectual component. We have seen that\nhis late doctrine of the efficacious idea involved the position that we\nhave pure intellectual perceptions produced by God’s intellectual idea\nof extension. But his mature position that this idea is also the cause\nof our sensations allows for the claim that our most basic sensory\ncontact with the material world has an intellectual component. \n\nWe know that Malebranche’s doctrine of the vision in God conflicts\nwith Descartes’ doctrine of the creation of the eternal truths.\nHowever, there are further departures from orthodox Cartesianism that\nare linked to two qualifications of this doctrine. The first\nqualification is that God’s idea of extension can reveal only the\nnature of bodies and not their existence. This qualification is not\nexplicit in the initial edition of the Recherche, which says\nonly that the existence of properties of bodies external to us is\n“very difficult to prove” (Malebranche [OC], 1:122).\nFoucher had objected that Malebranche has no good reason to affirm\nthe external existence of these properties. In “Eclaircissement\nVI,” Malebranche urged that the idea of extension does reveal the\npossible existence of the material world, and that Descartes has shown\nthat we have a probable argument for its actual existence deriving from\nour natural propensity to believe that there are bodies. However, he\nconceded in this text—without crediting Foucher—that\nneither he nor Descartes can provide an argument from reason that\ndemonstrates “with evidence” or “with geometric\nrigor” that this belief is true. His conclusion is that such an\nargument must appeal to faith in the veracity of the report in the\nScriptures that God has created the heavens and the earth. \n\nAccording to the second qualification of the vision in\nGod—which is found in the original edition of the\nRecherche—we perceive the nature of our soul not through\na clear idea in God, but only through a confused “consciousness\nor inner sensation” (conscience ou sentiment\nintérieur). Malebranche accepted the Cartesian commonplace\nthat consciousness reveals immediately the existence of the soul. He\nallowed that we know the nature of our soul to consist in thought,\nmoreover, and he embraced the Cartesian conclusion that the soul as a\nthinking thing is distinct from body as an extended thing. Yet he\ninsisted that we know that the soul is distinct from the body not by\nmeans of any direct insight into the nature of thought, but rather by\nseeing that thought is not contained in the idea of matter. More\ngenerally, Malebranche claimed that our lack of access to a clear idea\nof the soul is evident from the fact that we do not have knowledge of\nthought that matches our knowledge of the mathematical features of\nbodies. This last point turns on its head Descartes’ own conclusion in\n“Meditation II” that the nature of the human mind is\n“better known” than the nature of body; for Malebranche, it\nis the nature of body that is better known than the nature of mind. \n\nIn “Eclaircissement XI,” Malebranche attempted to counter\n“the authority of Descartes” by arguing that the\nCartesians themselves must admit that they have only a confused\nawareness of the nature of the sensory modifications of the soul. He\nnoted that while the intellectual idea allows the various modes of\nextension to be related in a precise manner, there is no clear scale\non which we can order our sensations of different shades of the same\ncolor, not to mention our sensations of sensible qualities of\ndifferent kinds. Malebranche took the confusion in the sensations to\nreveal a confusion in our perception of the nature of the soul. He\nadded that Cartesians can discern that sensible qualities are\nmodifications of an immaterial soul only by seeing that they are\n“not clearly contained in the idea we have of matter.” For\na discussion sympathetic to Malebranche’s critique of Descartes’s\naccount of our knowledge of mind, see Schmaltz (1996); for more recent\ndiscussions that defend Descartes against this critique, see Nolan and\nWhipple (2005) and LoLorodo (2005). \n\nMalebranche is known for his occasionalism, that is, his doctrine\nthat God is the only causal agent, and that creatures merely provide\nthe “occasion” for divine action. On the old textbook\naccount, occasionalism was an ad hoc response to the purported\nproblem in Descartes of how substances as distinct in nature as mind\nand body are can causally interact. According to this account,\nMalebranche was driven by this problem with Cartesian dualism to\npropose that it is God who brings it about that our sensations and\nvolitions are correlated with motions in our body. \n\nHowever, occasionalism was already an old doctrine at the time that\nThomas Aquinas (1225–1274) wrote against it. (There is a helpful\nsurvey, in German, of the earlier history of occasionalism in Perler\nand Rudolph 2000.) Thomas indicated that the primary concern of the\noccasionalists was to strengthen the assertion of God’s\nomnipotence. Though he allowed that God must “concur” with\ncreatures in producing effects, Thomas also claimed that there is\nreason to conclude that creatures are true secondary causes. For\ninstance, he urged that it is more in accord with divine greatness to\nsay that God communicates His power to creatures.  Moreover, he\nclaimed that it is simply evident to the senses that creatures have\nthe power to bring about effects. Thomas also argued that if there\nwere no natures in creatures that explain effects, there could be no\ntrue scientific explanation of effects through their natural\ncauses. \n\nMalebranche was concerned to respond to all of these arguments against\noccasionalism, particularly as they were developed in the work of\nscholastics such as Suárez. Against the first point that God’s\ngreatness requires the communication of His power, he countered that\nit is in fact idolatrous to attribute divine power to creatures.\nMalebranche’s argument that God alone can produce effects relies on\nthe assumption that “a true cause … is one such that the\nmind perceives a necessary connection [liaison\nnécessaire] between it and its effects” (Malebranche\n[OC], 2:316). He claimed that there is such a connection neither\namong bodily states, nor between bodily and mental states, nor among\nmental states. In all of these cases, one can deny the connections\nwithout contradiction.  There can be a necessary causal connection in\nonly one case, namely, the connection between the volitions of an\nomnipotent agent and its upshots. Thus, only such an agent, namely,\nGod, can be a true cause. (For different interpretations of this\nargument, cf. Lee 2008 and Ott 2008). \n\nIn the Entretiens sur la métaphysique, Malebranche\noffered a different argument based on Descartes’s suggestion in\n“Meditation III” that God conserves the world by\ncontinuously creating it. The argument begins with the claim that God\nmust create bodies in some particular place and in determinate\nrelations of distance to other bodies. If God conserves a body by\ncreating it in the same place from moment to moment, that body remains\nat rest, and if he conserves it by creating it in different places from\nmoment to moment, it is in motion. We cannot even create motion in our\nown bodies. Rather, it is God who must produce it on the occasion of\nvolitional states. Moreover, it is not motions in our brain that cause\nour sensory states, but God who produces them on the occasion of the\npresence of such motions. Finally, I have indicated the view in the\nEntretiens that God produces our intellectual states through\nthe union of our mind with His “intelligible extension.”\nWhile the argument from the necessity of the causal connection yields\nthe result that only an omnipotent being can be a cause, the argument\nhere is that only that being which creates/conserves the world can\ncause various bodily and mental states. However, both arguments\nconverge on the conclusion, which Malebranche claimed to find in\nAugustine, that all creatures depend entirely on God. (For further\ndiscussion of Malebranche’s various arguments for occasionalism, see\nLee 2007 and Lee 2008.) \n\nThe second scholastic argument against occasionalism appealed to the\npurported fact that it is evident to the senses that creatures have\ncausal power. For Malebranche, however, this argument is no more\npersuasive than the argument that bodies must have colors and tastes\nsince our senses tell us that they do. As indicated above, Malebranche\noffered Cartesian grounds for thinking that the purpose of our\nsensations is not to reveal the true nature of the material world, but\nrather to indicate what is helpful or harmful to our body. Malebranche\nheld that our attribution of causal powers to bodies manifests in\nparticular an attachment to the body that is an effect of original sin.\nDue to this attachment, we take objects in the material world to be a\ncause of our happiness rather than God. \n\nIn “Eclaircissement XV,” Malebranche responded to the\nscholastic point that occasionalism renders scientific explanation\nimpossible by appealing to the fact that God is not an arbitrary agent,\nbut acts in accord with His wisdom. This wisdom dictates that He act\n“almost always” by means of a “general and\nefficacious will.” Such a will produces effects that are\nperfectly law-like. For instance, God acts by a general will in\nproducing changes in bodies in accord with the law of the communication\nof motion. Malebranche did allow that God can produce miracles by\n“particular volitions” that are not law-like. However, he\nemphasized that there are relatively few such volitions in God. Thus,\nwe can offer scientific explanations that appeal to the laws of motion\nthat reflect the nature of God’s general will. \n\nThere is an important non-scholastic objection to Malebranche’s\noccasionalism in the work of Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle\n(1657–1757), who was to become the perpetual secretary of the Paris\nAcadémie des Sciences. In his 1686 Doutes sur le\nsystème physique des causes occasionelles, Fontenelle\nargued that Malebranche’s mechanistic physics is incompatible with his\noccasionalism.  This is so because according to mechanism, bodily\ncollision necessitates change in motion.  But then bodily collision\nsatisfies Malebranche’s main requirement for being a true cause\ninsofar as it has a necessary connection to its effect; thus the\nconflict with occasionalism. In his 1688 Entretien sur la\nmétaphysique, Malebranche offered the response that the\nlaws governing the bodily effects of collision derive from God’s will\nrather than from the nature of bodies (Malebranche [OC],\n12:164). For different assessments of this response to Fontenelle,\ncf. Downing (2005) and Schmaltz (2008). \n\nMalebranche was not the first Cartesian to endorse occasionalism.\nThere were followers of Descartes such as Louis de la Forge\n(1632–1666) and Claude Clerselier (1614–1684) who stressed that God\nmust be the cause of the communication of motion in bodily collisions\ngiven the passivity of Cartesian matter. These Cartesians attempted to\npreserve some room for the action of finite minds on body, but the\nCartesian Geraud de Cordemoy (1626–1684) went further in claiming that\nonly God can cause changes in the material world. However, none of\nthese thinkers went as far as Malebranche in arguing that God must\nproduce all real changes in nature. Moreover, Malebranche is\ndistinctive in providing an explanation of God’s action that\ndistinguishes His general will from His particular volitions. For a recent discussion of issues connected to Malebranche’s notion of particular volitions, see Walsh and Stencil (2016). \n\nThe presence of various evils in the world is problematic for anyone\nwho claims that this world was created by a God who has infinite\npower, knowledge and goodness. However, the problem is particularly\nacute for an occasionalist such as Malebranche who holds that God is\nthe only true cause of effects in nature. Malebranche offered a\ntheodicy that addresses the problem of evil by emphasizing that in the\n“order of nature” God acts for the most part through His\ngeneral will.  In Nature et grâce, he started by\nadmitting that God could have acted by particular volitions to prevent\nnatural evils such as malformed offspring (a fitting example given his\nown malformed spine), and thus could have produced a more perfect\nworld than He actually did create. In correspondence with Leibniz,\nMalebranche emphasized this point in distinguishing his theodicy from\nLeibniz’s (see Schmaltz 2010). However, Malebranche also claims that\nGod could have created a more perfect world only by departing from\nsimple laws, thereby sacrificing the simplicity and uniformity of\naction that is a supreme mark of His wisdom. God produces the natural\nevils that follow from simple laws not because He wills those\nparticular effects, but because He wills a world that best reflects\nHis wisdom by possessing the most effects governed by the fewest\nlaws. \n\nIn his Réflexions on Malebranche’s Nature et\ngrâce, Arnauld objected to what he took to be the\nsuggestion in his target text that God has concern only for general\nfeatures of the world and does not will the details of His\neffects. For Arnauld, divine providence requires that God intend all\nof the particularities of the world He creates. In the recent\nAnglophone literature, there is a debate over whether Arnauld’s\ncritique is based on a proper interpretation of Malebranche.  This\ndebate was promoted by the claim in Nadler (1993) that when\nMalebranche says that God acts by means of general laws or volitions,\nhe means only that God has volitions in accord with general laws, and\nthat his doctrine of God’s continual creation in the\nEntretiens sur la métaphysique in fact requires\ndistinct volitions for distinct effects (cf. the development of this\ninterpretation in Pessin 2001 and Stencil 2011). Other commentators\nhave countered that Arnauld was correct in thinking that Malebranche’s\nclaim in Nature et grâce that God acts by relatively\nfew general volitions involves a rejection of the position that He has\nvolitions for each particular effect . Some evidence for this view is\nprovided by the fact that Malebranche emphasized that the laws\nthemselves are “efficacious,” and that God employs\nrelatively few volitions in producing effects in the order of nature\n(see Black 1997, Jolley 2002, and Schmaltz 2003). \n\nMalebranche insisted that God’s general will is operative not only\nin the order of nature, but also in the “order of grace.”\nHowever, he noted that the production of effects in the latter order\nalso involves human action that is free in the strong sense of not\nbeing determined by anything external to the agent. His appeal to this\nsort of freedom is in fact central to his solution to the problem of\nmoral evil, that is, the compatibility of sin with God’s goodness.\nAccording to Malebranche, God is not responsible for sinful action\nsince such action derives not from Him but from sinful agents. Arnauld\nobjected that this solution is “more pelagian than anything in\nPelagius,” and that one must side with Augustine, who declared\nPelagianism a heresy. Malebranche responded that he did not follow\nPelagius in denying the importance of grace, and that Augustine himself\nhad emphasized our freedom in action. \n\nMalebranche also held that it is obvious by “inner\nsensation” that we are genuinely free. However, there is some\nquestion whether this introspective report is compatible with\nMalebranche’s occasionalist claim that God is the only real cause.\nThis question has generated considerable discussion in the recent\nAnglophone literature (cf. Schmaltz 2005, Greenberg 2008 and 2015, and\nPeppers-Bates 2009). Malebranche did hold that God alone is the cause\nof our inclination to love “the good in general.” However,\nhe also insisted that we are free to “consent” to the\nstopping of that inclination at a particular object other than\nGod. Such consent results in an “absolute and intrinsic”\nlove of that object that is sinful given that this love is worthy only\nof God. The consent is free because one is always able to suspend\nconsent and to search for objects more worthy of our love. \n\nThere is the claim that Malebranche’s account of consent remained\nessentially the same over the course of his philosophical career (see\nKremer 2000, 206).  However, there is some reason to think that this\naccount in fact was subject to significant development. In the initial\ndiscussion of freedom in the Recherche, there is the\nsuggestion that consent consists in our “determination” of\nour natural inclination toward the good in general (Malebranche\n[OC], 1:46). However, this suggestion conflicts with the claim in\nthe very same text that it is God who directs our natural inclination\ntoward particular objects prior to any free act on our part. Indeed,\nin his later discussion of freedom in “Eclaircissement I,”\nMalebranche held that our freedom consists not in an active turning of\nour natural inclination, but rather in the inactivity of our resting\nwith a particular good (Malebranche [OC], 3:548). This view is\nfurther developed in the Traité de morale, which in\nthe case of free action distinguishes between the force\ninvolved in the search for truth and the liberté that\ndirects this search.  Free acts of consent fall under the latter,\nwhereas the former involves the dispositions of our free inclinations\nthat God produces in us on the occasion of these acts (Malebranche\n[OC], 11:70). In contrast to his earlier suggestion that our free\nacts involve either a turning of our natural inclination or an\ninactivity coupled with such an inclination, Malebranche’s view here\nis that such acts are inactivities coupled with a distinct sort of\nfree inclination. There are different answers to the question of\nwhether this account serves to reconcile Malebranche’s occasionalism\nwith his claim that we have genuine freedom of action; cf. Schmaltz\n(2005), which defends the coherence of Malebranche’s final position on\nthis issue (in line with the earlier view in Laporte 1951), and\nGreenberg (2015), which argues that this position is not fully\nconsistent. \n\nThe theocentrism that is evident in Malebranche’s doctrines of the\nvision in God and occasionalism would lead us to expect that God plays\na central role in his moral theory. This expectation is borne out by\nhis discussion in the Traité de morale. Indeed,\nMalebranche’s two doctrines are present in that work. The vision in God\nis reflected in the insistence there that moral duties are dictated by\n“relations of perfection” revealed in God’s wisdom. As in\nthe case of necessary truths concerning body, so in the case of moral\ntruths Malebranche unequivocally rejected Cartesian voluntarism. The\ndoctrine of occasionalism is reflected in Malebranche’s insistence that\nGod is our greatest good since He alone can cause our happiness. This\npoint indicates that Malebranche took moral action to require a\nconsideration not only of abstract relations of perfection, but also\nthe happiness of the self. \n\nMalebranche starts from the Augustinian position that morality\nconcerns the proper ordering of our love. Given the importance of human\nfreedom for his theodicy, it is not surprising that Malebranche\ninsisted that the love required for moral action involve the free\nexercise of the will. His version of the “good will” is one\nthat freely strives to be guided in action by objective relations of\nperfection that hold among the various objects of love. God is the most\nperfect being, and hence the most worthy of our love, while human\nbeings are more perfect than mere material beings, and thus more worthy\nof our love. When the intensity of our love matches the order among\nperfections, we have a right love that provides the basis for virtue,\nthat is, a habitual inclination to love objects according to their\nperfections. \n\nMalebranche held that due to original sin, we are inclined not to\nright love directed by our perception of relations of perfection in\nGod’s wisdom, but rather to a disordered love directed by bodily\npleasures deriving from the soul-body union. This is the counterpart to\nthe disordered inclination of our will to make judgments about the\nnature of the material world that are based on sensations deriving from\nthe union. For Malebranche, a corrective to both of these disorders of\nthe will is to attend to clear ideas that exist in God. \n\nMalebranche sometimes suggested that disordered love of bodily\npleasure derives from self-love. Encouraged by this suggestion, one of\nhis followers, François Lamy, claimed that his position leads\nto the quietist view in Fénélon that moral conduct\nrequires a “pure love of God” that involves no concern for\nthe self or its pleasure. This position, which Lamy himself endorsed,\nwas later condemned by the Catholic Church, due in large part to a\ncampaign against Fénélon directed by his critic,\nBossuet. But Malebranche insisted that such a position directly\nconflicts with his own view that pleasure itself is a good that is\nrequired as a motive for action. When critics such as Arnauld and\nRégis charged that this view results in hedonism, Malebranche\nresponded that it is only ordered pleasures that bring the greatest\ngood. This response is reflected in his claim to Lamy that a\ndisordered love of self is to be contrasted not with pure love of God,\nbut rather with an ordered love that seeks happiness in the\ncontemplation of the greatest good, God. In emphasizing the need for\nthis sort of love of God, Malebranche was returning to his view in the\npreface to the Recherche that it is through a union with God\nthat the mind “receives its life, its light, and its entire\nfelicity.” For more on Malebranche’s engagement with quietism,\nsee Montcheuil (1947). But cf. the critical evaluation of Montcheuil’s\ndecidedly pro-Malebranche view of this exchange with Lamy in Dreyfus\n(1958), 318–22. There is a recent discussion of the relation of Malebranche to quietism in Walsh and Lennon (2012). \n\nBardout (2000), 111–62, includes the argument that Malebranche’s\nexchange with Lamy on pure love in fact marks a transition in his\nthought from a “metaphysical morality” that stresses the\npurely intelligible nature of our moral end, to a “sensible\nmorality” that stresses a conception of that end in terms of the\ncause of our pleasure. However, this shift may not be as dramatic as\nin the case of Malebranche’s conception of freedom. For the view that\nGod is our sole good insofar as He is the sole cause of our pleasure\nis present already in the first edition of the Recherche\n(Malebranche [OC], 172–73). Even so, there is reason to think that\nthis view becomes increasingly important to Malebranche’s moral\ntheory.","contact.mail":"tschmalt@umich.edu","contact.domain":"umich.edu"}]
