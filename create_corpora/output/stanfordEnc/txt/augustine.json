He is a saint of the Catholic Church, and his authority in\ntheological matters was universally accepted in the Latin Middle Ages\nand remained, in the Western Christian tradition, virtually\nuncontested till the nineteenth century. The impact of his views on\nsin, grace, freedom and sexuality on Western culture can hardly be\noverrated. These views, deeply at variance with the ancient\nphilosophical and cultural tradition, provoked however fierce\ncriticism in Augustine’s lifetime and have, again, been\nvigorously opposed in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries from\nvarious (e.g., humanist, liberal, feminist) standpoints. Philosophers\nkeep however being fascinated by his often innovative ideas on\nlanguage, on skepticism and knowledge, on will and the emotions, on\nfreedom and determinism and on the structure of the human mind and,\nlast but not least, by his way of doing philosophy, which\nis—though of course committed to the truth of biblical\nrevelation—surprisingly undogmatic and marked by a spirit of\nrelentless inquiry. His most famous work, the Confessiones,\nis unique in the ancient literary tradition but greatly influenced the\nmodern tradition of autobiography; it is an intriguing piece of\nphilosophy from a first-person perspective. Because of his importance\nfor the philosophical tradition of the Middle Ages he is often listed\nas the first medieval philosopher. But even though he was born several\ndecades after the emperor Constantine I had terminated the\nanti-Christian persecutions and, in his mature years, saw the\nanti-pagan and anti-heretic legislation of Theodosius I and his sons,\nwhich virtually made Catholic (i.e., Nicene) Christianity the official\nreligion of the Roman Empire, Augustine did not live in a\n“medieval” Christian world. Pagan religious, cultural and\nsocial traditions were much alive in his congregation, as he often\ndeplores in his sermons, and his own cultural outlook was, like that\nof most of his learned upper-class contemporaries, shaped by the\nclassical Latin authors, poets and philosophers whom he studied in the\nschools of grammar and rhetoric long before he encountered the Bible\nand Christian writers. Throughout his work he engages with pre- and\nnon-Christian philosophy, much of which he knew from firsthand.\nPlatonism in particular remained a decisive ingredient of his thought.\nHe is therefore best read as a Christian philosopher of late antiquity\nshaped by and in constant dialogue with the classical tradition.\n\nTranslations from Greek or Latin texts in this entry are by the\nauthor, unless otherwise stated. Biblical quotations are translated\nfrom Augustine’s Latin version; these may differ from the Greek\nor Hebrew original and/or from the Latin Vulgate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugustine (Aurelius Augustinus) lived from 13 November 354 to 28\nAugust 430. He was born in Thagaste in Roman Africa (modern Souk Ahras\nin Algeria). His mother Monnica (d. 388), a devout Christian, seems to\nhave exerted a deep but not wholly unambiguous influence on his\nreligious development. His father Patricius (d. 372) was baptized on\nhis deathbed. Augustine himself was made a catechumen early in his\nlife. His studies of grammar and rhetoric in the provincial centers of\nMadauros and Carthage, which strained the financial resources of his\nmiddle-class parents, were hoped to pave his way for a future career\nin the higher imperial administration. In Carthage at the age of ca.\n18, he found a mistress with whom he lived in a monogamous union for\nca. 14 years and who bore him a son, Adeodatus, who was baptized\ntogether with his father in Milan and died a little later (ca. 390)\naged 18. Ca. 373 Augustine became a “hearer”\n(auditor) of Manicheism, a dualistic religion with Persian\norigins that, in Northern Africa, had developed into a variety of\nChristianity (and was persecuted by the state as a heresy). His\nadherence to Manicheism lasted for nine years and was strongly opposed\nby Monnica. Though probably active as a Manichean apologist and\nmissionary, he never became one of the sect’s\n“elect” (electi), who were committed to\nasceticism and sexual abstinence. In 383 he moved to Milan, then the\ncapital of the western half of the Empire, to become a publicly paid\nprofessor of rhetoric of the city and an official panegyrist at the\nImperial court. Here he sent away his mistress to free the way for an\nadvantageous marriage (a behavior presumably common for young\ncareerists at that epoch). At Milan he underwent the influence of\nBishop Ambrose (339–397), who taught him the allegorical method\nof Scriptural exegesis, and of some Neoplatonically inclined\nChristians who acquainted him with an understanding of Christianity\nthat was philosophically informed and, to Augustine, intellectually\nmore satisfactory than Manicheism, from which he had already begun to\ndistance himself. The ensuing period of uncertainty and\ndoubt—depicted in the Confessiones as a crisis in the\nmedical sense—ended in summer 386, when Augustine converted to\nascetic Christianity and gave up both his chair of rhetoric and his\nfurther career prospects. After a winter of philosophical leisure at\nthe rural estate of Cassiciacum near Milan, Augustine was baptized by\nAmbrose at Easter 387 and returned to Africa, accompanied by his son,\nsome friends and his mother, who died on the journey (Ostia, 388). In\n391 he was, apparently against his will, ordained a priest in the\ndiocese of the maritime city of Hippo Regius (modern Annaba/Bône\nin Algeria). About five years later (ca. 396) he succeeded the local\nbishop. This ecclesiastical function involved new pastoral, political,\nadministrative and juridical duties, and his responsibility for and\nexperiences with an ordinary Christian congregation may have\ncontributed to modify his views on grace and original sin (Brown 2000:\nch. 15). But his rhetorical skills equipped him well for his daily\npreaching and for religious disputes. Throughout his life as a bishop\nhe was involved in religious controversies with Manicheans, Donatists,\nPelagians and, to a lesser extent, pagans. Most of the numerous books\nand letters he wrote in that period were part of these controversies\nor at least inspired by them, and even those that were not (e.g.,\nDe Genesi ad litteram, De trinitate) combine\nphilosophical or theological teaching with rhetorical persuasion\n(Tornau 2006a). Polemics against his former co-religionists, the\nManicheans, looms large in his work until about 400; the debate with\nthem helped to shape his ideas on the non-substantiality of evil and\non human responsibility. The Donatist schism had its roots in the last\ngreat persecution at the beginning of the fourth century. The\nDonatists saw themselves as the legitimate successors of those who had\nremained steadfast during the persecution and claimed to represent the\nAfrican tradition of a Christian “church of the pure”.\nSince 405 the Donatists were subsumed under the imperial laws against\nheresy and forced to re-enter the Catholic church by legal means;\nthese measures were intensified after a conference at Carthage (411)\nhad marked the official end of Donatism in Africa (Lancel &\nAlexander 1996–2002). By way of his assiduous writing against\nthe Donatists, Augustine sharpened his ecclesiological ideas and\ndeveloped a theory of religious coercion based on an intentionalist\nunderstanding of Christian love. Pelagianism (named after the British\nascetic Pelagius) was a movement Augustine became aware of around 412.\nHe and his African fellow-bishops managed to get it condemned as a\nheresy in 418. While not denying the importance of divine grace,\nPelagius and his followers insisted that the human being was by nature\nfree and able not to sin (possibilitas). Against this view,\nAugustine vigorously defended his doctrine of the human being’s\nradical dependence on grace, a conviction already voiced in the\nConfessiones but refined and hardened during the controversy.\nThe last decade of Augustine’s life is marked by a vitriolic\ndebate with the Pelagianist ex-bishop Julian of Aeclanum who accused\nAugustine of crypto-Manicheism and of denying free will while\nAugustine blamed him and the Pelagianists for evacuating\nChrist’s sacrifice by denying original sin (Drecoll\n2012–2018). Controversy with pagan traditionalists seems to have\nreached a peak after 400, when Augustine refuted a series of\nobjections against Christianity apparently extracted from\nPorphyry’s treatise Against the Christians\n(Letter 102; Bochet 2011), and after 410, when the city of\nRome had been sacked by Alaric and his Goths. The City of\nGod, Augustine’s great apology, was prompted by this\nsymbolic event, though it is by no means just a response to pagan\npolemics.\n Augustine’s life ended when the Vandals besieged Hippo; he is\nsaid to have died with a word of Plotinus on his lips (Possidius,\nVita Augustini 28.11, after Plotinus, Enneads I\n4.7.23–24). \nAugustine’s literary output surpasses the preserved work of\nalmost all other ancient writers in quantity. In the\nRetractationes (“Revisions”, a critical survey of\nhis writings in chronological order down to 428 CE) he suggests a\nthreefold division of his work into books, letters and sermons\n(Retractationes 1, prologue 1); about 100 books, 300 letters,\nand 500 sermons have survived. Augustine’s literary career after\nhis conversion began with philosophical dialogues. The first of these,\nwritten in Cassiciacum in 386/7, deal with traditional topics such as\nskepticism (Contra Academicos), happiness (De beata\nvita), evil (De ordine) and the immortality of the soul\n(Soliloquia, De immortalitate animae). Augustine continued to\npursue these issues in dialogues on the immateriality of the soul\n(De quantitate animae, 388), language and learning (De\nmagistro, 388–391), freedom of choice and human\nresponsibility (De libero arbitrio, begun in 388 and\ncompleted perhaps as late as 395) and the numeric structure of reality\n(De musica, 388–390). The treatise De vera\nreligione (389–391) is a kind of summa of Augustine’s\nearly Christian philosophy. After the start of his ecclesiastical\ncareer he abandoned the dialogue form, perhaps because he realized its\nelitist and potentially misleading character (G. Clark 2009; Catapano\n2013). Of the works from his priesthood and episcopate, many are\ncontroversial writings against the Manicheans (e.g., Contra\nFaustum Manichaeum, around 400), the Donatists (e.g., Contra\nlitteras Petiliani, 401–405; De baptismo, 404) and\nthe Pelagians (e.g., De spiritu et littera, 412; Contra\nIulianum, 422; De gratia et libero arbitrio,\n424–427; and his last and unfinished work Contra Iulianum\nopus imperfectum, which preserves a substantial portion of the\notherwise lost treatise Ad Florum by his Pelagian adversary\nJulian of Aeclanum). Among the philosophically most interesting of\nthese works are De utilitate credendi (391–392, a\ndefense of faith/belief against Manichean rationalism), De natura\nboni (399, a concise anti-Manichean argument for the doctrine\nthat evil is a privation of goodness rather than an independent\nsubstance), De natura et gratia (413–417, a reply to\nPelagius’ treatise De natura) and De correptione et\ngratia (426/427, refuting a Christian version of the Stoic\n‘Lazy Argument’ that had been put forward against Augustine’s\ndoctrine of grace). Augustine is however most famous for the five long\ntreatises with a wider scope he composed between 396 and 426. The\nConfessiones (ca. 396–400), probably his most original\nwork, is “philosophy in autobiography” (Mann 2014) rather\nthan an autobiography in a modern sense. It shows how an individual\nlife—Augustine’s own—is made sense of by God’s\nprovidence and grace as well as by his creation and economy of\nsalvation. De doctrina christiana (begun in 396/7 but\ncompleted only in 426/7) is a handbook of biblical hermeneutics and\nChristian rhetoric; it delineates the semiotic dichotomy of\n“things” (res) and—especially\nlinguistic—“signs” (signa) and critically\nassesses the importance of the classical disciplines for the biblical\nexegete. De trinitate (begun in 399 and completed in 419 or\nperhaps as late as 426) has impressed modern philosophical readers by\nits probing analyses of the human mind as an “image” of\nthe Divine Trinity. De Genesi ad litteram (401/2–416)\nis an attempt at winning a philosophically justifiable cosmology from\nthe opening chapters of Genesis. Here as in most of Augustine’s\nworks philosophy is inseparable from biblical exegesis. The monumental\napologetic treatise De civitate dei (begun in 412, two years\nafter the sack of Rome, and completed in 426) argues that happiness\ncan be found neither in the Roman nor the philosophical tradition but\nonly through membership in the city of God whose founder is Christ.\nAmong many other things, it has interesting reflections on the secular\nstate and on the Christian’s life in a secular society. The\nsermons document Augustine’s ability to adapt complex ideas to a\nlarge and not overly learned audience. Two long series on the Psalms\n(Enarrationes in Psalmos, ca. 392–422) and the Gospel\nof John (In Iohannis evangelium tractatus, ca. 406–420)\nstand out; a series of sermons on the First Letter of John (In\nepistulam Iohannis ad Parthos tractatus decem, 407) is\nAugustine’s most sustained discussion of Christian love. The\nletters are not personal or intimate documents but public writings\nthat are part of Augustine’s teaching and of his ecclesiastical\npolitics. Some of them reach the length of full treatises and offer\nexcellent philosophical discussions (Letter 155 on virtue;\nLetter 120 on faith and reason; Letter 147 on the\n“seeing” of God). \nFrom ancient thought Augustine inherited the notion that philosophy is\n“love of wisdom” (Confessiones 3.8; De\ncivitate dei 8.1), i.e., an attempt to pursue happiness—or,\nas late-antique thinkers, both pagan and Christian, liked to put it,\nsalvation—by seeking insight into the true nature of things and\nliving accordingly. This kind of philosophy he emphatically endorses,\nespecially in his early work (cf., e.g., Contra Academicos\n1.1). He is convinced that the true philosopher is a lover of God\nbecause true wisdom is, in the last resort, identical with God, a\npoint on which he feels in agreement with both Paul (1 Corinthians\n1:24) and Plato (cf. De civitate dei 8.8). This is why he\nthinks that Christianity is “the true philosophy”\n(Contra Iulianum 4.72; the view is common among ancient,\nespecially Greek, Christian thinkers) and that true philosophy and\ntrue (cultic) religion are identical (De vera religione 8).\nIn case of doubt, practice takes precedence over theory: in the\nCassiciacum dialogues Monnica, who represents the saintly but\nuneducated, is credited with a philosophy of her own (De\nordine 1,31–32; 2.45). At the same time, Augustine sharply\ncriticizes the “philosophy of this world” censured in the\nNew Testament that distracts from Christ (Colossians 2:8). In his\nearly work he usually limits this verdict to the Hellenistic\nmaterialist systems (Contra Academicos 3.42; De\nordine 1.32); later he extends it even to Platonism because the\nlatter denies the possibility of a history of salvation (De\ncivitate dei 12.14). The main error he faults the philosophers\nwith is arrogance or pride (superbia), a reproach that does\nnot weigh lightly given that arrogance is, in Augustine’s view,\nthe root of all sins. Out of arrogance the philosophers presume to be\nable to reach happiness through their own virtue (De civitate\ndei 19.4, a criticism primarily directed against the Stoics), and\neven those among them who have gained insight into the true nature of\nGod and his Word (i.e., the Platonists) are incapable of\n“returning” to their divine “homeland” because\nthey proudly reject the mediation of Christ incarnate and resort to\nproud and malevolent demons instead, i.e., to the traditional pagan\ncults and to theurgy (Confessiones 7.27; In evangelium\nIohannis tractatus 2.2–4; De civitate dei\n10.24–29; Madec 1989). In his first works Augustine epitomizes\nhis own philosophical program with the phrase “to know God and\nthe soul” (Soliloquia 1.7; De ordine 2.47) and\npromises to pursue it with the means provided by Platonic philosophy\nas long as these are not in conflict with the authority of biblical\nrevelation (Contra Academicos 3.43). He thereby restates the\nold philosophical questions about the true nature of the human being\nand about the first principle of reality, and he adumbrates the key\nNeoplatonic idea that knowledge of our true self entails knowledge of\nour divine origin and will enable us to return to it (cf. Plotinus,\nEnneads VI.9.7.33–34). While these remain the basic\ncharacteristics of Augustine’s philosophy throughout his career,\nthey are considerably differentiated and modified as his engagement\nwith biblical thought intensifies and the notions of creation, sin and\ngrace acquire greater significance. Augustine is entirely unaware of\nthe medieval and modern distinction of “philosophy” and\n“theology”; both are inextricably intertwined in his\nthought, and it is unadvisable to try to disentangle them by focusing\nexclusively on elements that are deemed “philosophical”\nfrom a modern point of view. \nAugustine tells us that at the age of eighteen Cicero’s (now\nlost) protreptic dialogue Hortensius enflamed him for\nphilosophy (Confessiones 3.7), that as a young man he read\nAristotle’s Categories (ib. 4.28) and that his\nconversion was greatly furthered by his Neoplatonic readings (ib.\n7.13) as well as by the letters of Paul (ib. 7.27; Contra\nAcademicos 2.5). He is more reticent about Manichean texts, of\nwhich he must have known a great deal (van Oort 2012). From the 390s\nonwards the Bible becomes decisive for his thought, in particular\nGenesis, the Psalms and the Pauline and Johannine writings (even\nthough his exegesis remains philosophically impregnated), and his\nmature doctrine of grace seems to have grown from a fresh reading of\nPaul ca. 395 (see\n 7.6 Grace, Predestination and Original Sin). \nThe most lasting philosophical influence on Augustine is Neoplatonism.\nHe does not specify the authors and the exact subjects of the\n“books of the Platonists” (Confessiones 7.13)\ntranslated into Latin by the fourth century Christian Neoplatonist\nMarius Victorinus (ib. 8.3) he read in 386. In the twentieth century\nthere was an ongoing and sometimes heated debate on whether to\nprivilege Plotinus (who is mentioned in De beata vita 4) or\nPorphyry (who is named first in De consensus evangelistarum\n1.23 ca. 400) as the main Neoplatonic influence on Augustine (for\nsummaries of the debate see O’Donnell 1992: II 421–424;\nKany 2007: 50–61). Today most scholars accept the compromise\nthat the “books of the Platonists” comprised some\ntreatises of Plotinus (e.g., Enneads I.6, I.2, V.1,\nVI.4–5) and a selection from Porphyry (Sententiae and,\nperhaps, Symmikta Zetemata). In any event, the importance of\nthis problem should not be overrated because Augustine seems to have\ncontinued his Neoplatonic readings after 386. Around 400 he had\nPorphyry’s Philosophy from the Oracles at his disposal;\nin De civitate dei 10 (ca. 417) he quotes from his Letter\nto Anebo and from an otherwise unattested anagogic treatise\ntitled, in the translation used by Augustine, De regressu\nanimae, the influence of which some have suspected already in\nAugustine’s earliest works. For the philosophy of mind in the\nsecond half of De trinitate he may have turned to Neoplatonic\ntexts on psychology. While the exact sources of Augustine’s\nNeoplatonism elude us, source criticism has been able to determine\nsome pervasive features of his thought that are doubtlessly\nNeoplatonic in origin: the transcendence and immateriality of God; the\nsuperiority of the unchangeable over the changeable (cf. Plato,\nTimaeus 28d); the ontological hierarchy of God, soul and body\n(Letter 18.2); the incorporeality and immortality of the\nsoul; the dichotomy of the intelligible and the sensible realms\n(attributed to Plato in Contra Academicos 3.37); the\nnon-spatial omnipresence of the intelligible in the sensible\n(Confessiones 1.2–4; Letter 137.4) and the\ncausal presence of God in his creation (De immortalitate\nanimae 14–15; De Genesi ad litteram 4.12.22); the\nexistence of intelligible (Platonic) Forms that are located in the\nmind of God and work as paradigms of the sensible things (De\ndiversis quaestionibus 46); the inwardness of the intelligible\nand the idea that we find God and Truth by turning inwards (De\nvera religione 72); the doctrine of evil as lack or privation of\ngoodness; the understanding of the soul’s love of God as a\nquasi-erotic desire for true beauty (Confessiones 10.38; cf.\nRist 1994: 155). A distinctly Platonic element is the notion of\nintellectual or spiritual ascent. Augustine thinks that by turning\ninwards and upwards from bodies to soul (i.e., from knowledge of\nobjects to self-knowledge) and from the sensible to the intelligible\nwe will finally be able to transcend ourselves and get in touch with\nthe supreme being that is none other than God and Truth and that is\nmore internal to us than our innermost self (Confessiones\n3.11; MacDonald 2014: 22–26; Augustine’s biblical proof\ntext is Romans 1:20, quoted, e.g., ib. 7.16). Ascents of this kind are\nubiquitous in Augustine’s work (e.g., De libero\narbitrio 2.7–39; Confessiones 10.8–38;\nDe trinitate 8–15). Whether the condensed versions in\nthe Confessiones (7.16; 7.23; 9.24–26) should be read\nas reports of mystical experiences is difficult to determine (Cassin\n2017). An early version of the Augustinian ascent is the\nproject—outlined in De ordine (2.24–52) but soon\nabandoned and virtually retracted in De doctrina\nchristiana—of turning the mind to the intelligible and to\nGod by means of a cursus in the liberal (especially mathematical)\ndisciplines (Pollmann & Vessey 2005). It is remotely inspired by\nPlato’s Republic and may have had a Neoplatonic precedent\n(Hadot 2005), though use of Varro’s work on the disciplines\ncannot be excluded (Shanzer 2005). As late as De civitate dei\n8 (ca. 417) he grants, in a brief doxography organized according to\nthe traditional fields of physics, ethics and epistemology, that\nPlatonism and Christianity share some basic philosophical insights,\nviz. that God is the first principle, that he is the supreme good and\nthat he is the criterion of knowledge (De civitate dei\n8.5–8; cf. already De vera religione 3–7). In\nspite of these important insights, Platonism cannot however lead to\nsalvation because it is unable or unwilling to accept the mediation of\nChrist. It is, therefore, also philosophically defective (De\ncivitate dei 10.32). \nCicero is Augustine’s main source for the Hellenistic\nphilosophies, notably Academic skepticism and Stoicism. As a part of\nhis cultural heritage, Augustine quotes him and the other Latin\nclassics as it suits his argumentative purposes (Hagendahl 1967). His\nearly ideal of the sage who is independent of all goods that one can\nlose against one’s will is inherited from Stoic ethics (De\nbeata vita 11; De moribus 1.5; Wetzel 1992:\n42–55). Though the implication that the sage’s virtue\nguarantees his happiness already in this life is later rejected as\nillusory (De trinitate 13.10; De civitate dei 19.4;\nRetractationes 1.2; Wolterstorff 2012), the Christian martyr\ncan be styled in the manner of the Stoic sage whose happiness is\nimmune to torture (Letter 155.16; Tornau 2015: 278).\nAugustine’s Manichean past was constantly on his mind, as his\nincessant polemics shows; its precise impact on his thought is however\ndifficult to assess (van Oort (ed.) 2012; Fuhrer 2013; BeDuhn 2010 and\n2013). The claim of Julian of Aeclanum that with his doctrine of\npredestination and grace Augustine had fallen back into Manichean\ndualism has appealed to some modern critics, but Julian must ignore\nessential features of Augustine’s thought (e.g., the notion of\nevil as privatio boni) to make his claim plausible\n(Lamberigts 2001). \nAugustine’s earliest surviving work is a dialogue on Academic\nskepticism (Contra Academicos or De Academicis, 386;\nFuhrer 1997). He wrote it at the beginning of his career as a\nChristian philosopher in order to save himself and his readers from\nthe “despair” that would have resulted if it could not be\nproven that, against the skeptic challenge, truth is attainable and\nknowledge and wisdom possible (cf. Retractationes 1.1.1). The\nsense of despair must have been very real to him when, after having\nbroken with Manicheism but still being unable to see the truth of\nCatholic Christianity, he decided to “withhold assent until some\ncertainty lighted up” (Confessiones 5.25). His\ninformation about skepticism does not come from a contemporary skeptic\n“school”, which hardly existed, but from Cicero’s\nAcademica and Hortensius. Much of the discussion in\nContra Academicos is thus devoted to the debate between\nHellenistic Stoics and skeptics about the so-called\n“grasping” or kataleptic appearance, i.e., the problem\nwhether there are appearances about the truth of which one cannot be\nmistaken because they are evident by themselves (Bermon 2001:\n105–191). Unlike the original Stoics and Academics, Augustine\nlimits the discussion to sense impressions because he wants to present\nPlatonism as a solution to the skeptic problem and to point out a\nsource of true knowledge unavailable to the Hellenistic\nmaterialists. \nUnlike modern anti-skeptical lines of argumentation, Augustine’s\nrefutation of skepticism does not aim at justifying our ordinary\npractices and beliefs. To refute the Academic claim that, since the\nwise person can never be sure whether she has grasped the truth, she\nwill consistently withhold assent in order not to succumb to empty\nopinion, he thinks it sufficient to demonstrate the existence of some\nkind of knowledge that is immune to skeptical doubt. His strategy\ntherefore consists in pointing out 1) the certainty of\nself-referential knowledge (the wise person “knows\nwisdom”, Contra Academicos 3.6; the Academic skeptic\n“knows” the Stoic criterion of truth, ib. 3.18–21);\n2) the certainty of private or subjective knowledge (I am certain that\nsomething appears white to me even if I am ignorant\nwhether it is really white, ib. 3.26); 3) the certainty of formal,\nlogical or mathematical, structures (ib. 3.24–29), knowledge of\nwhich is possible independently of the mental state of the knower,\nwhereas the reliability of sense impressions differs according as we\nare awake or dreaming, sane or insane. Modern critics have not been\nvery impressed by these arguments (e.g., Kirwan 1989: 15–34),\nand an ancient skeptic would rightly have objected that being limited\nto subjective or formal knowledge, they could not justify the\ndogmatists’ claim to objective knowledge of reality (cf. Sextus\nEmpiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism 1.13). Yet this is not\nAugustine’s point. To him it matters to have shown that even if\nmaximal concessions are made to skepticism concerning the\nunknowability of the external world attainable by the senses, there\nremains an internal area of cognition that allows for and even\nguarantees certainty. This is why Contra Academicos ends with\na sketch of Platonic epistemology and ontology and with an\nidiosyncratic if not wholly unparalleled reconstruction of the history\nof the Academy according to which the Academics were in fact\ncrypto-Platonists who hid their insight into transcendent reality and\nrestricted themselves to skeptical arguments to combat the materialist\nand sensualist schools dominant in Hellenistic times until authentic\nPlatonism emerged again with Plotinus (Contra Academicos\n3.37–43; the story is still told in Letter 118 of 410,\nwhere the renaissance of Platonism is however connected with the rise\nof Christianity). The only realities that meet the Hellenistic\ncriterion of truth and guarantee absolute certainty by being\nself-evident are the Platonic Forms (Contra Academicos 3.39;\ncf. De diversis quaestionibus 9; Cary 2008a: 55–60).\nThe “objects” of knowledge that appear in\nAugustine’s anti-skeptical arguments thus either are the\nPlatonic Forms themselves or at least point out the way of accessing\nthem. This squares with the early Augustine’s tendency to\ninterpret the Forms, or at any rate the most basic among them, as\n“numbers”, i.e., as the formal and normative structures\nand standards that govern all reality and enable us to understand and\nevaluate it (De ordine 2.14; 16; De musica\n6.57–58; O’Daly 1987: 101–102; see also\n 5.2 Illumination).\n Strictly speaking, Augustine’s anti-skeptical arguments do not\njustify the claim that knowledge can be derived from the senses;\nhaving sensible and mutable objects, they cannot but yield opinion or,\nat best, true belief. The later Augustine, in a more generous way of\nspeaking, widens the term “knowledge” (scientia,\nto be distinguished from “wisdom”, sapientia) so\nas to include what we learn through sense perception and from reliable\nwitnesses (De trinitate 15.21; cf. De civitate dei\n8.7; Retractationes 1.14.3; Siebert 2018; see\n 5.3 Faith and Reason). \nAugustine’s most famous anti-skeptical argument is what is\ncommonly called his “cogito-like” argument because it is\nsimilar to (and probably inspired) the Cogito of Descartes (Matthews\n1992; Menn 1998; Fuchs 2010). Like Descartes’, Augustine’s\ncogito establishes an area immune to skeptical doubt by inferring from\nmy awareness of my own existence the truth of the proposition “I\nexist”. Even if I were in error in uttering this proposition, it\nwould still be true that I, who am in error, exist (De civitate\ndei 11.26: si enim fallor, sum; for the exact\nreconstruction of this argument cf. Horn 1995: 81–87; Matthews\n2005: 34–42). The argument does not yet appear in Contra\nAcademicos but is easily recognized as a development of the\nargument from subjective knowledge (Contra Academicos 3.26);\nAugustine considers it a valid refutation of skepticism from his\nearliest (De beata vita 7) to his latest works (De\ntrinitate 15.21; for further attestations see Soliloquia\n2.1; De duabus animabus 13; De libero arbitrio 2.7;\nDe vera religione 73; Confessiones 7.5; 13.12). The\nscope of the argument in Augustine is both wider and narrower than in\nDescartes. The Augustinian cogito lacks the systematic importance of\nits Cartesian counterpart; there is no attempt to found a coherent and\ncomprehensive philosophy on it. On some occasions, however, it works\nas a starting point for the Augustinian ascent to God (De libero\narbitrio 2.7, where the ascent leads to an understanding of God\nas immutable truth and wisdom; for a condensed version, cf. De\nvera religione 72–73, where Augustine even makes\nsupra-rational Truth the source and criterion of the truth of the\ncogito itself). The most impressive example is the second half of De\ntrinitate. Here the attempt to reach a rational understanding of\nthe mystery of the Trinity by means of an inquiry into the structure\nof the human mind starts with an analysis of the mind’s\ninalienable self-love and self-awareness (see\n 6.2 The Human Mind as an Image of God;\n Augustine does not, however, claim that the mind’s certainty\nabout itself entails a similar certainty about the nature of God).\nAugustine’s cogito argument is not limited to epistemology but\ncan also be employed in an ethical context because it proves not only\nmy existence and my thinking (and, by implication, my being alive) but\nalso my loving and willing. I am as certain that I will as I am\ncertain that I exist and live, and my will is as undeniably mine as is\nmy existence and my life. Therefore, my volitions are imputable to me,\nand it is I who am responsible for my choices (and not some evil\nsubstance present in my soul but foreign to my own self, as, on\nAugustine’s interpretation, Manichean dualism would have it; cf.\nDe duabus animabus 13; Confessiones 7.5; De\ncivitate dei 5.10). \nAugustine’s theory of knowledge—his so-called doctrine of\nillumination—is a distinctly non-empiricist epistemology based\non a probably Neoplatonic reading of Plato’s doctrine of\nrecollection (Burnyeat 1987; MacDonald 2012b; King 2014a:\n147–152; Karfíková 2017). Like Plato and his\nfollowers, Augustine thinks that true knowledge requires first-hand\nacquaintance; second-hand information, e.g., from reliable testimony,\nmay yield true and even justifiable belief, but not knowledge in the\nstrict sense.\n In the case of sensible objects—which, strictly speaking, do\nnot admit of knowledge at all but only opinion—such\n first-hand acquaintance is possible through sense perception.\nCognition of intelligible objects, however, can be neither reached\nempirically by means of abstraction nor transmitted to us\nlinguistically by a human teacher (see\n 5.4 Language and Signs);\n rather, such cognition requires personal intellectual activity that\nresults in an intellectual insight, which we judge by a criterion we\nfind nowhere but in ourselves. The paradigm of this kind of cognition\nare mathematical and logical truths and fundamental moral intuitions,\nwhich we understand not because we believe a teacher or a book but\nbecause we see them for ourselves (De magistro 40, cf. De\nlibero arbitrio 2.34). The condition of possibility and the\ncriterion of truth of this intellectual insight is none other than God\n(a view attributed, with explicit approval, to the Platonists in\nDe civitate dei 8.7), who, in the manner of a Neoplatonic\nimmaterial principle, is both immanent and transcendent in relation to\nour soul. Augustine mostly explains this Platonizing theory of a\npriori knowledge by means of two striking images: the inner teacher\nand illumination. The former is introduced in the dialogue De\nmagistro (ca. 390) and remains frequent especially in the sermons\n(e.g., In epistulam Iohannis ad Parthos tractatus decem 3.13;\nFuhrer 2018b); according to it, Christ is present in our souls and by\n“presiding over” them like a teacher guarantees the\ntruthfulness of our understanding (De magistro 38–39,\ncf. Ephesians 3:17 for the image and, for the idea that truth\n“lives in the inner man”, De vera religione 72).\nThe latter appears first in the Soliloquia (1.12–15)\nand is ubiquitous in Augustine’s writings (cf. esp. De\ntrinitate 12.24). It is ultimately derived from the Analogy of\nthe Sun in Plato’s Republic (508a-509b; cf. Rist 1994:\n78–79). In the Soliloquia Augustine says, in a manner\nstrongly reminiscent of Plato, that just as the sun is both visible\nitself and illumines the objects of sight so as to enable the eye to\nsee them, God is intelligible himself and illumines the intelligible\nobjects (which are here identified with the objects of the liberal\ndisciplines and subordinated to God) so as to enable reason (the\n“eye” of the soul) to activate its capacity for\nintellection. The later version in De trinitate explicitly\npresents divine illumination as an alternative to Platonic\nrecollection and situates it in the framework of a theory of creation.\nHere Augustine says that the human mind has been created by God in\nsuch a way as to be “connected” to intelligible reality\n“from below” (subiuncta) and with a capacity\n(capacitas) that enables it to “see” the\nintelligibles in the light of intelligible truth, just as the eye is\nby nature able to see colors in the light of the sun. Obviously,\n“capacity” in this case does not mean pure potentiality\n(as in the tabula rasa theory endorsed by Augustine’s\ninterlocutor Euodius in De quantitate animae 34) but\ncomprises at least implicit or latent knowledge of moral and\nepistemological standards. Both images, if properly read, should\npreclude the misunderstanding that Augustine’s gnoseology makes\nhuman knowledge entirely dependent on divine agency, with the human\nbeing becoming merely a passive recipient of revelation (cf. Gilson\n1943: ch. 4 and Lagouanère 2012: 158–180 for the debates\nabout Augustinian illumination in medieval and modern philosophy).\nCognition does not simply result from the presence of Christ in our\nsoul but from our “consulting” the inner teacher, i.e.,\nour testing propositions that claim to convey a truth about\nintelligible reality (or even a general truth about sensible objects,\ncf. Letter 13.3–4) against the inner standards we\npossess thanks to the presence of Christ (De magistro\n37–38; this way of “consulting” the inner truth is\nrepeatedly dramatized in the Confessiones, e.g., 11.10;\n11.31; Cary 2008b: 100). And while every human being is\n“illumined” by the divine light at least from behind so as\nto be able to pass true judgments about right and wrong or good and\nevil, in order to develop these natural intuitions to full knowledge\nor wisdom and to be able actually to lead a virtuous life, we need to\nconvert to God, the “source” of the light (De\ntrinitate 14.21). Thus, while all human beings are by nature\ncapable of accessing intelligible truth, only those succeed in doing\nso who have a sufficiently good will (De magistro\n38)—presumably those who endorse Christian religion and live\naccordingly. This strong voluntary element intimately connects\nAugustine’s epistemology with his ethics and, ultimately, with\nhis doctrine of grace (on the parallel structure of cognition and grace in Augustine\nsee Lorenz 1964). Like all human agency, striving for wisdom takes place\nunder the conditions of a fallen world and meets the difficulties and\nhindrances humanity is subject to because of original sin. \nIn order to illustrate what he means by “seeing things by\nourselves” “in the light of truth”, Augustine often\ncites the example of the Socratic maieutic dialogue (De\nmagistro 40; cf. De immortalitate animae 6; De\ntrinitate 12.24), and in some passages of his early work he seems\nto subscribe to the Platonic doctrine of recollection (familiar to him\nfrom Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 1.57) in such a way as to\nimply the preexistence of the soul (Soliloquia 2.35,\nretracted in Retractationes 1.4.4; De immortalitate\nanimae 6; De quantitate animae 34, retracted in\nRetractationes 1.8.2). It is difficult to tell whether the\nearly Augustine literally believed in recollection and preexistence\n(Karfíková 2017; O’Daly 1987: 70–75;\n199–207), not least because he was aware that some Neoplatonists\ninterpreted Platonic recollection as an actualization of our\never-present but latent knowledge of the intelligible rather than as a\nremembrance of our past acquaintance with it (Letter 7.2, cf.\nPlotinus, Enneads IV.3.25.31–33; O’Daly 1976).\nIf, as in De immortalitate animae 6, recollection is taken to\nprove the immortality of the soul (as it did in the Phaedo),\nit is hard to see how preexistence should not be implied. In any\nevent, it is imprecise to say, as it is sometimes done, that Augustine\ngave up the theory of recollection because he realized that\npreexistence was at variance with Christian faith. In De civitate\ndei (12.14 etc.) Augustine emphatically rejects\nPlatonic-Pythagorean metempsychosis or the transmigration of souls as\nincompatible with eternal happiness and the economy of salvation, and\nin De trinitate (12.24) the Meno version of the\nrecollection theory, which implies transmigration, is rejected in\nfavor of illumination. Yet it is a fallacy to claim that recollection\nentails transmigration. The early Augustine may have believed in\npreexistence (perhaps simply as a corollary of the immortality of the\nsoul), but there is no evidence that he believed in the transmigration\nof souls; conversely, his rejection of transmigration did not prevent\neven the late Augustine from considering preexistence—at least\ntheoretically—an option for the origin of the soul\n(Letter 143.6 from 412; cf.\n 6.1 Soul as a Created Being). \nWhereas modern discussion tends to regard faith and reason as\nalternative or even mutually exclusive ways to (religious) truth, in\nAugustine’s epistemological and exegetical program the two are\ninseparable. He rejects the rationalism of the philosophers and,\nespecially, the Manicheans as an unwarranted over-confidence into the\nabilities of human reason resulting from sinful pride and as an\narrogant neglect of the revelation of Christ in Scripture (De\nlibero arbitrio 3.56; 60; Confessiones 3.10–12).\nAgainst the fideism he encountered in some Christian circles (cf.\nLetter 119 from Consentius to Augustine) he insisted that it\nwas good and natural to employ the rational capacity we have been\ncreated with to search for an understanding of the truths we accept\nfrom the authority of the biblical revelation, even though a true\nunderstanding of God will only be possible after this life when we see\nhim “face to face” (Letter 120.3–4). In\nthis epistemological and exegetical program, which since Anselm of\nCanterbury has aptly been labeled as “faith seeking\nunderstanding” (cf. De trinitate 15.2: fides\nquaerit, intellectus invenit) or “understanding of\nfaith” (intellectus fidei), faith is prior to\nunderstanding in time but posterior to it in importance and value\n(De ordine 2.26; De vera religione 45;\nLetter 120.3; van Fleteren 2010). The first step toward\nperfection is to believe the words of Scripture; the second is to\nrealize that the words are outward signs of an internal and\nintelligible reality and that they admonish us to turn to and to\n“consult” inner truth so as to reach true understanding\nand, accordingly, the good life (cf.\n 5.2 Illumination;\n 5.4 Language and Signs). \nPhilosophical argument may be of help in this process;\nyet as Augustine notes as early as in Contra Academicos\n(3.43), it needs to be tied to the authority of Scripture and the\nCreed to prevent the frailty of human reason from going astray (cf.\nConfessiones 7.13). The Augustine of the earliest dialogues\nseems to have entertained the elitist idea that those educated in the\nliberal arts and capable of the Neoplatonic intellectual ascent may\nactually outgrow authority and achieve a full understanding of the\ndivine already in this life (De ordine 2.26, but contrast ib.\n2.45 on Monnica). In his later work, he abandons this hope and\nemphasizes that during this life, inevitably characterized by sin and\nweakness, every human being remains in need of the guidance of the\nrevealed authority of Christ (Cary 2008b: 109–120). Faith is\nthus not just an epistemological but also an ethical category; it is\nessential for the moral purification we need to undergo before we can\nhope for even a glimpse of true understanding (Soliloquia\n1.12; De diversis quaestionibus 48; De trinitate\n4.24; Rist 2001). To a great extent, Augustine’s defense of\nfaith as a valid epistemic category rests on a rehabilitation of true\nbelief against the philosophical (Platonic and Hellenistic) tradition.\nAugustine neatly distinguishes “belief” (fides,\nthe word he also uses for religious faith), which entails the\nbeliever’s awareness that he does not know, from\n“opinion” (opinio), defined by the philosophers\nas the illusion of knowing what one in fact does not know (De\nutilitate credendi 25; Letter 120.3). Without belief in\nthe former sense, we would have to admit that we are ignorant of our\nown lineage (Confessiones 6.7) and of the objects of the\nhistorical and empirical sciences, of which, as Augustine asserts in a\ncritique of Platonism, first-hand knowledge is rarely possible (De\ntrinitate 4.21). The belief that a person we have not seen was or\nis just may trigger our fraternal love for him (De trinitate\n8.7; Bouton-Touboulic 2012: 182–187; conversely, Augustine asks\nthose who are united with him in fraternal love to believe what he\ntells them about his life, Confessiones 10.3). And obviously,\nthe crucial events of the history of salvation, Jesus’ death on\nthe cross and his resurrection, cannot be known but only believed qua\nhistorical events, even though qua signs they may lead to\nunderstanding by prompting us to an intelligible truth (De\ntrinitate 13.2). Thus, while no doubt faith in revelation\nprecedes rational insight into its true meaning, the decision about\nwhose authority to believe and whom to accept as a reliable witness is\nitself reasonable (De vera religione 45; Letter\n120.3). Even so, belief may of course be deceived (De\ntrinitate 8.6). In ordinary life, this is inevitable and mostly\nunproblematic. A more serious problem is the justification of belief\nin Scripture, which, for Augustine, is the tradition and authority\n(auctoritas, not potestas) of the Church (Contra\nepistulam fundamenti 5.6; Rist 1994: 245). \nAugustine’s philosophy of language is both indebted to the\nStoic-influenced Hellenistic and Roman theories of grammar and highly\ninnovative (Rist 1994: 23–40; King 2014b). He follows the Stoics\nin distinguishing between the sound of a word, its meaning and the\nthing it signifies (De dialectica 5; De quantitate animae 66; cf. Sextus Empiricus, Adversus\nmathematicos 8.11–12 = 33B Long-Sedley), but he seems to\nhave been the first to interpret language as such as a system of signs\nand to integrate it into a general semiotics (Fuhrer 2018a: 1696; Cary\n2008b; Mayer 1969 and 1974). In his handbook of biblical exegesis and\nChristian rhetoric, De doctrina christiana (1.2;\n2.1–4), Augustine divides the world into “things”\nand “signs” (i.e., things that, apart from being what they\nare, signify other things) and furthermore distinguishes between\n“natural” or involuntary signs (e.g., smoke signifying\nfire) and voluntary or “given” signs (a distinction akin,\nbut not equivalent, to the older discussion about nature or convention\nas the origin of language). Language is defined as a system of given\nsigns by means of which the speaker signifies either things or her\nthoughts and emotions (Enchiridion 22). In the exegetical\nframework of De doctrina christiana, the “thing”\nsignified by the verbal signs of Scripture is God, the Supreme Being.\nAugustine therefore begins with a sketch of his theology and ethics\ncentered around the notions of love of God and neighbor before he sets out his biblical hermeneutics which,\nagain, posits love as the criterion of exegetical adequacy (Pollmann\n1996; Williams 2001). The words of the Bible are external signs\ndesigned to prompt us to the more inward phenomenon of love and,\nultimately, to God who is beyond all language and thought. This may be\ngeneralized to the principle that external—verbal and\nnon-verbal—signs operate on a lower ontological level than the\ninward and intelligible truth they attempt to signify and that they\nare superseded in true knowledge which is knowledge not of signs but\nof things. This holds not only for words, even the words of Scripture,\nbut also for the sacraments and for the Incarnation of Christ\n(Contra epistulam fundamenti 36.41). Augustine’s most\nsustained discussion of language, the early dialogue De\nmagistro, asks how we learn things from words and relates\nlinguistic signification to the epistemology of illumination (Nawar\n2015). After a long discussion of how verbal signs signify things or\nstates of mind and how they relate to other signs, it turns out,\nrather surprisingly, that we do not learn things from signs at all\nbecause in order to understand the meaning of a sign we already have\nto be acquainted with the thing signified. This is ultimately a\nversion of Meno’s paradox, and Augustine solves it by\nintroducing the metaphors of the inner teacher and of illumination,\ni.e., by means of an internalist theory of learning recognizable as a\nNeoplatonic interpretation of Platonic anamnesis (De magistro\n38–40).\n This does not mean that words are useless. They inform us about\nthings that are inaccessible to direct acquaintance and thus generate\ntrue belief; most importantly, they admonish us to\n“consult” the inner teacher and to understand things by\nourselves (this, according to Augustine, is the whole point of the\nSocratic dialogue). This goes even for the acquisition of language\nitself: We understand the sign “bird-catching”, not simply\nby being shown a person engaged in that activity and being told that\nhe is signified by that name, but by observing him and figuring out\nfor ourselves what “bird-catching” means (ib. 32; on this\nand Wittgenstein’s criticism of what he took to be\nAugustine’s view of language acquisition, see Matthews 2005:\n23–33). In the later books of De trinitate and in the\nsermons on the Trinity, Augustine frequently refers to a phenomenon\ncalled “inner word”, which he uses to explain the relation\nof the inner-Trinitarian Word or Logos from the Prologue of John (John\n1:1) to Christ incarnate. Just as the spoken word signifies a concept\nthat we have formed within our mind and communicates it to others, so\nChrist incarnate signifies the divine Logos and admonishes and assists\nus to turn to it (cf. De trinitate 15.20; De doctrina\nchristiana 1.12; Sermon 119.7; 187.3). In De\ntrinitate Augustine expands this to a theory about how the inner\nword or concept is formed (14.10; 15.25; cf. 15.43). The inner word is\ngenerated when we actualize some latent or implicit knowledge that is\nstored in our memory. It is not a sign, nor of linguistic nature\n(Augustine insists that it is neither Latin nor Greek nor Hebrew), but\nrather seems to be a kind of a-temporal intellectual insight that\ntranscends language (cf. De catechizandis rudibus 3).\nProperly speaking, then, the theory of the inner word is not a\nlinguistic theory at all. \nLike most ancient philosophers, Augustine thinks that the human being\nis a compound of body and soul and that, within this compound, the\nsoul—conceived as both the life-giving element and the center of\nconsciousness, perception and thought—is, or ought to be, the\nruling part. The rational soul should control the sensual desires and\npassions; it can become wise if it turns to God, who is at the same\ntime the Supreme Being and the Supreme Good.\n In his Manichean phase, he conceived of both God and the soul as\nmaterial entities, the soul being in fact a portion of God that had\nfallen into the corporeal world where it remained a foreigner, even to\nits own body (De duabus animabus 1; Confessiones\n8.22). After his Platonist readings in Milan had provided him with the\nadequate philosophical means to think about immaterial, non-spatial\nreality (Confessiones 7.1–2; 7.16), he replaced this\nview, which he later represents as a rather crude dualism, with an\nontological hierarchy in which the soul, which is mutable in time but\nimmutable in space, occupies a middle position between God, who is\ntotally unchangeable immaterial being (cf. MacDonald 2014), and\nbodies, which are subject to temporal and spatial change\n(Letter 18.2). The soul is of divine origin and even god-like\n(De quantitate animae 2–3); it is not divine itself but\ncreated by God (the talk about divinity of the soul in the Cassiciacum\ndialogues seems to be a traditional Ciceronian element, cf. Cary 2000:\n77–89; for a Plotinian interpretation see O’Connell 1968:\n112–131). In De quantitate animae, Augustine broadly\nargues that the “greatness” of the soul does not refer to\nspatial extension but to its vivifying, perceptive, rational and\ncontemplative powers that enable it to move close to God and are\ncompatible with and even presuppose immateriality (esp. ib.\n70–76; Brittain 2003). An early definition of soul as “a\nrational substance fitted for rule over a body” (ib. 22) echoes\nPlatonic views (cf. the definition of the human being as “a\nrational soul with a body” in In Iohannis evangelium\ntractatus 19.15; O’Daly 1987: 54–60). Later on, when\nthe resurrection of the body becomes more important to him, Augustine\nemphasizes—against Porphyry’s alleged claim that in order\nto be happy, the soul must free itself from anything\ncorporeal—that it is natural and even desirable for a soul to\ngovern a body (De Genesi ad litteram 12.35.68), but he\nnevertheless remains convinced that soul is an incorporeal and\nimmortal substance that can, in principle, exist independently of a\nbody. In the Soliloquia (2.24), following the tradition of\nPlato and of Cicero’s Tusculan Disputations, he\nproposes a proof for the immortality of the soul which he expressly\nintroduces as an alternative to the final proof of the Phaedo\n(Soliloquia 2.23, cf. Phaedo 102d-103c). The proof\nis constructed from elements from Porphyry’s Isagoge\nand his Commentary on Aristotle’s Categories (rather\nelementary texts that Augustine would have encountered long before his\nPlatonic readings at Milan) and seems to be original with him (Tornau\n2017). It says that since truth is both eternal and in the soul as its\nsubject, it follows that soul, the subject of truth, is eternal too.\nThis is fallacious, because if truth is eternal independently of the\nsoul it cannot be in the soul as in its subject (i.e., as a property),\nand if it is a property of the soul, it cannot ensure its eternity. In\nthe incomplete draft of a third book of the Soliloquia\npreserved under the title De immortalitate animae, Augustine\ntherefore modifies the proof and argues that soul is immortal because\nof the inalienable causal presence of God (= Truth) in it. It turns\nout however that even if this version of the proof is successful, it\nonly demonstrates the soul’s eternal existence as a (rational)\nsoul but not its eternal wisdom (De immortalitate animae 19;\nZum Brunn 1969: 17–41 [1988: 9–34]), in the hope of which the\ninterlocutors had set out to prove the immortality of the soul in the\nfirst place (Soliloquia 2.1). After De immortalitate\nanimae, Augustine never returned to his proof. But neither did he\ndisown it; as late as De trinitate (13.12), he endorses the\nPlatonic axiom that soul is by nature immortal and that its\nimmortality can, in principle, be proven by philosophical means. He\nalso sticks to his conviction that immortality is a necessary\ncondition of happiness but insists that it is not a sufficient\ncondition, given that immortality and misery are compatible (cf.\nDe civitate dei 9.15 on the misery of the wicked demons).\nTrue happiness will only be realized in the afterlife as a gift of\nGod’s grace, when, thanks to the resurrection of the body, not\njust the soul but the human being as a whole will live forever.\nResurrection, however, is not susceptible of rational proof; it is a\npromise of God that must be believed on Scriptural authority (De\ntrinitate ib.). \nTogether with an essentially Platonic notion of the soul, Augustine\ninherits the classical problems of Platonic soul-body dualism. How can\nsoul fulfil its task of “governing” the body (cf. De quantitate\nanimae 22) if it is incorporeal itself? And how are\ncorporeal and psychic aspects related to each other in phenomena that\ninvolve both body and soul, especially if, like passions and desires,\nthese are morally relevant? These problems are further complicated by\nthe Platonic axiom that incorporeal entities, being ontologically\nprior to corporeal ones, cannot be causally affected by them.\nAugustine’s solution is indebted to Plotinus’ strategy of\nmaking the relation of the soul to the bodily affections an\nessentially cognitive one (O’Daly 1987, 84–87;\nHölscher 1986, ch. 2.2.1; Nash 1969, 39–59; Bermon 2001:\n239–281). With Plotinus, he insists that sense perception is not\nan affection which the soul passively undergoes (as Stoic materialism\nwould have it, where sensory perception was interpreted as a kind of\nimprint in the soul) but its active awareness of affections undergone\nby the body (De quantitate animae 41; 48; De Genesi ad\nlitteram 7.14.20; Plotinus, Enneads I.4.2.3–4;\nBrittain 2002: 274–282). In De quantitate animae, the\nframework of this theory is the general argument that the relation of\nsoul to body must be conceived of not in terms of space but of\n“power” (see above). In De musica (6.11), this is\ndeveloped into the idea that sense perception is the soul’s\nawareness of modifications of its own formative and vivifying\nactivities that result from its reacting to the external impulses\nundergone by the body. In addition to the usual five senses, Augustine\nidentifies a sensory faculty that relates the data of the senses to\neach other and judges them aesthetically (but not morally; De musica 6.5; 19);\nin De libero arbitrio (2.8–13) he calls this the\n“inner sense” (on the Aristotelian background cf.\nO’Daly 1987: 102–105). \nIn Neoplatonism it was disputed how soul, being immortal, immaterial\nand ontologically superior to body, came to be incorporated\nnevertheless. The basic options, present already in Plato’s\ndialogues, were either that the disembodied soul had\n“fallen” into the corporeal world because of some error\n(as in the Phaedrus myth) or that it had been sent into the\ncosmos by God to impart life and order to it (as in the\nTimaeus; for harmonizing Neoplatonic exegeses, see Plotinus,\nEnneads IV.8, and Macrobius, Commentary on Cicero’s\nSomnium Scipionis 1.10–14). Augustine addresses the issue\nin the horizon of his doctrine of creation and, in the period of the\nPelagian Controversy, of the debate about the transmission of original\nsin (see\n 9. Gender, Women and Sexuality).\n In De libero arbitrio (3.56–59), he distinguishes the\nthree options of creationism (God creates a new soul for every newborn\nbody), traducianism (the soul is transmitted from the parents to the\nchild like corporeal properties), and preexistence, which is\nsubdivided into the Platonic options of voluntary or god-sent descent.\nAfter 412 all these options come to the fore again (Letters\n143.5–11; 166; 190; and the treatise De anima et eius\norigine). Augustine discards none of them officially except for\nthe notion, wrongly associated with Origenism, which was considered a\nheresy at the time, that incorporation was a punishment for a sin\ncommitted by the pre-existent soul (De civitate dei 11.23).\nIn practice, he narrows the debate down to the alternative between\ncreationism and traducianism, which appear to have been the only\noptions taken seriously by his Christian contemporaries. Augustine\nrefused to take a stand till the end of his life, probably because\nneither option really suited his purposes (Rist 1994: 317–320;\nO’Connell 1987; Mendelson 1998): Creationism made original sin\nvery difficult to explain; traducianism was functional in this\nrespect, but it was a materialist and even biologist theory that ran\ncounter to Augustine’s Platonism and was further compromised\nbecause it had been brought up by his African predecessor Tertullian\n(d. c. 220 CE), a Stoicizing corporealist who had ended his life as a\nheretic (Rist 1994: 123). \nAugustine deploys what we may call his philosophy of the mind most\nfully in his great work on Nicene Trinitarian theology, De\ntrinitate. Having removed apparent Scriptural obstacles to the\nequality and consubstantiality of the three divine persons (bks.\n1–4) and having set out the grammar, as it were, of adequate\nspeaking about the Trinity by distinguishing absolute and relative\npropositions about God and the three Persons (bks. 5–7; King\n2012), he turns to an analysis of the human mind as an image of God\n(bks. 8–15; Brachtendorf 2000; Ayres 2010; Bermon &\nO’Daly (eds.) 2012). The basis for this move is, of course,\nGenesis 1:26–27. Augustine follows a long-standing Jewish and\nPatristic tradition, familiar to him from Ambrose, according to which\nthe biblical qualification of the human being as an image of God\nreferred not to the living body (a literalist reading vulnerable to\nthe Manichean charge of anthropomorphism, cf. Confessiones\n6.4) but to what is specifically human, i.e., the “inner\nman” (2 Corinthians 4:16, quoted, e.g., in De trinitate\n11.1) or the mind (mens). Assuming, in a Platonist manner,\nthat “image” in this case does not merely mean an analogy\nbut a causal effect of the original that reflects the essential\nfeatures of the latter on a lower ontological level,\nhe scrutinizes the human mind for triadic structures that meet the\nNicene requirements of equality and consubstantiality and may thus\ngive a—however faint—understanding of the Triune God. The\ngeneral pattern of his argument is the Augustinian ascent from the\nexternal to the internal and from the senses to God; but since human\nreason is, whether by nature or due to its fallen state, hardly\ncapable of knowing God, Augustine this time is obliged to interrupt\nand re-start the ascent several times. The final book shows that the\nexercise of analyzing the human mind does have preparatory value for\nour thinking about the Trinity but does not yield insight into the\ndivine by being simply transferred to it (De trinitate\n15.10–11). The three elements Augustine discerns in all our\ncognitive acts from sense perception to theoretical reason or\ncontemplation are: [1] an object that is either external to the mind\n(as in sense perception) or internal to it, in which case it is an\nimage or a concept stored in our memory; [2] a cognitive faculty that\nmust be activated or “formed” by the object if cognition\nis to come about; [3] a voluntary or intentional element that makes\nthe cognitive faculty turn to its object so as to be actually formed\nby it. The last element ensures the active character of perception and\nintellection\n but also gives weight to the idea that we do not cognize an object\nunless we consciously direct our attention to it (MacDonald 2012b).\nThough this triadic pattern is operative on all levels of human\ncognition, Augustine contends that only the mind’s intellectual\nself-knowledge on the level of contemplative reason (its “memory\nof itself, knowledge of itself and love of itself”) qualifies as\nan image of God because only here are the three elements as closely\nrelated to each other as in the Nicene dogma and because they are as\ninalienable as the mind’s immediate presence to itself (De\ntrinitate 14.19). This idea is carefully prepared in Book 10,\nwhich contains one of Augustine’s most remarkable arguments for\nthe substantiality of the mind and its independence of the body\n(Stróżyński 2013; Brittain 2012a; Matthews 2005:\n43–52; Bermon 2001, 357–404). Augustine begins by arguing\n(in a manner reminiscent of his cogito-like argument; see\n 5.1 Skepticism and Certainty)\n that the mind always already knows itself because it is always\npresent to and hence aware of itself. This pre-reflexive\nself-awareness is presupposed by every act of conscious cognition. If\nso, however, the Delphic command “Know thyself” cannot\nmean that the mind is to become acquainted with itself as if it had\nbeen unknown to itself before, but rather that it must become\nconscious of what it knew about itself all along and distinguish it\nfrom what it does not know about itself. As the mind in its fallen\nstate is deeply immersed in sensible reality, it tends to forget what\nit really is and what it knows it is and confounds itself with the\nthings it attaches the greatest importance to, i.e., sensible objects\nthat give it pleasure. The result are materialist theories about the\nsoul, which thus derive from flawed morality (De trinitate\n10.11–12). If it follows the Delphic command, however, the mind\nwill realize that it knows with certainty that it exists, thinks,\nwills etc., whereas it can at best merely believe that it is air, fire\nor brain (ib. 10.13).\n And as the substance or essence of the mind cannot be anything other\nthan what it knows with certainty about itself, it follows that\nnothing material is essential to the mind and that its essence must be\nsought in its mental acts (ib. 10.16). Full self-knowledge is reached,\nthen, when the mind’s inalienable self-awareness (se\nnosse, “to be acquainted with oneself”) is actualized\nto conscious “self-thinking” (se cogitare). How\nthis relates to the mind’s pre-reflexive presence to itself is\nnot entirely clear (for problems of interpretation, see, e.g., Horn\n2012; Brittain 2012b), but Augustine seems to think that not only the\nmind’s intellectual self-thinking but already its immediate\nself-awareness is triadically structured and an image of the Triune\nGod (De trinitate 14.7–14). Again, the ethical side of\nthe theory should not be overlooked. As a strong voluntary element is\npresent in and necessary for an act of cognition, what objects\n(imaginations, thoughts) we cognize is morally relevant and indicative\nof our loves and desires. And while the triadic structure of the mind\nis its very essence and hence inalienable, Augustine insists that the\nmind is created in the image of God, not because it is capable of\nself-knowledge, but because it has the potential to become wise, i.e.,\nto remember, know and love God, its creator (ib. 14.21–22). \nThe basic structure of Augustine’s ethics is that of ancient\neudaimonism (Holte 1962), but he defers happiness to the afterlife and\nblames the ancient ethicists for their arrogant\nconviction—resulting from their ignorance of the fallen\ncondition of humankind—that they could reach happiness in this\nlife by philosophical endeavor (De civitate dei 19.4;\nWolterstorff 2012; for a more optimistic view, cf. the early De\nordine 2.26). He takes it as axiomatic that happiness is the\nultimate goal pursued by all human beings (e.g., De beata\nvita 10; De civitate dei 10.1; De trinitate\n13.7, quoting Cicero’s Hortensius; for an interesting\ndiscussion of how the desire for happiness relates to our equally\nnatural desires for pleasure and for truth cf. Confessiones\n10.29–34; Matthews 2005: 134–145; Menn 2014: 80–95).\nHappiness or the good life is brought about by the possession of the\ngreatest good in nature that humans can attain and that one cannot\nlose against one’s will (e.g., lib. arb. 1.10–12;\nespecially in his early work Augustine shares the Stoics’\nconcern about the self-sufficiency and independence of the wise and\nhappy person, cf. Wetzel 1992, 42–55). This structure Augustine\ninscribes into his Neoplatonically inspired three-tiered ontological\nhierarchy (Letter 18.2)\n and concludes that the only thing able to fulfil the requirements for\nthe supreme good set by eudaimonism is the immutable God himself. The\nSupreme Being is also the greatest good; the desire of created being\nfor happiness can only be satisfied by the creator. As Augustine puts\nin concisely in De beata vita (11): “Happy is he who\nhas God”. Alternative formulations are “enjoyment of\nGod” (De civitate dei 8.8; De trinitate\n13.10), “contemplation of God” or “enjoyment of\ntruth” (De libero arbitrio 2.35). To “have”\nGod means in fact to know and, especially, to love God; Augustine\ntherefore interprets Psalm 72:28 (“For me it is good to cling to\nGod”) as a biblical telos formula or definition of the\nsupreme and beatifying good (De civitate dei 10.18; Tornau\n2015: 265–266). We are, in other words, happy, wise and virtuous\nif we turn to or “convert” to God. If we turn away from\nhim and direct our attention and love to the bodies—which are\nnot per se bad, as in Manicheism, but an infinitely lesser good than\nGod—or to ourselves, who are a great good but still subordinate\nto God, we become miserable, foolish and wicked (Letter 18.2;\nDe libero arbitrio 2.52–54; In Iohannis evangelium\ntractatus 20.11). Virtue is “love that knows its\npriorities” (ordo amoris, De civitate dei 15.22)\nwhereas vice or sin perverts the natural order. Just as after the Fall\nall human beings are inevitably tainted by sin, we need to be purified\nthrough faith in order to live well and to restore our ability to know\nand love God (De diversis quaestionibus 68.3; Cary 2008a:\n12–13). Augustine does not discard the intellectual element\ninherited from the ancient (Socratic) ethical tradition, and his\nnotion of conversion is certainly inspired by Neoplatonist\n“return” (epistrophe), but Augustine enhances the\nethical relevance of conversion and aversion by emphasizing their\nvoluntary character (cf. already De immortalitate animae\n11–12).\n The element of will or love is also crucial to the distinction between\n“enjoyment” (frui) and “use”\n(uti) that is first fully developed in De doctrina\nchristiana, bk. 1 (c. 396) and remains basic for his ethical\nthought. Following the ancient insight that we pursue some goods for\ntheir own sake and others for the sake of other and greater goods,\nAugustine states that to “enjoy” a thing means to cling to\nit with love for its own sake whereas to “use” it means to\nlove it for the sake of another thing which we want to enjoy. We love\nabsolutely only what we enjoy, whereas our love for things we use is\nrelative and even instrumental (De doctrina christiana 1.4).\nThe only proper object of enjoyment is God (cf. De civitate\ndei 8.8 where the same view is attributed to the Platonists).\nWickedness and confusion of the moral order results from a reversal of\nuse and enjoyment, when we want to enjoy what we ought to use (all\ncreated things, e.g., wealth, bodies or ourselves) and to use what we\nought to enjoy (this probably refers to the “carnal”\nunderstanding of religion of which Augustine often accuses the Jews).\nAn obvious problem of this system is the categorization of the\nbiblically prescribed love of the neighbor. Are we to enjoy our\nneighbor or to use her? Whereas natural moral intuition suggests the\nformer, Augustine’s systematic seems to require the latter. The\nproblem is inherited from ancient eudaimonism, where it takes some\nphilosophical effort to reconcile the intuition that concern for\nothers is morally relevant with the assumption that ethics is\nprimarily about the virtue and happiness of the individual. Augustine\nis aware of the problem and gives a differentiated answer. In De\ndoctrina christiana (1.20–21) he somewhat tentatively\nsuggests that to love our neighbor means to use him, not because he is\nmerely instrumental to our happiness but because we are enjoined to\nlove him as ourselves and because we love ourselves rightly only if we\nrefer our self-love to our desire to enjoy God. Love of the neighbor\nthus means to desire his true happiness in the same way as we desire\nour own. In substance, this remains Augustine’s view also in his\nlater work (cf., e.g., In epistulam Iohannis ad Parthos tractatus\ndecem 1.9), but he then prefers to avoid the counter-intuitive\nand potentially misleading talk about “using” fellow\nhumans and replaces it by a description of fraternal love as\n“mutual enjoyment in God” (e.g., De trinitate\n9.13; cf. already De doctrina christiana 1.35; 3.16; Rist\n1994: 159–168; O’Donovan 1980: 32–36;\n112–136). “In God” is presumably added to prevent\nthe misunderstanding that we are to enjoy the neighbor “in\nherself” or “in ourselves” without reference to God.\nThis would mean that we expect our true happiness from her, which no\nhuman can give; the result of this misdirection would be extreme\nmisery in the case of the neighbor’s loss (cf.\nConfessiones 4.9–11 on Augustine’s excessive\ngrief after the death of his friend; Nawar 2014). \nIn principle Augustine follows the view of the ancient eudaimonists\nthat virtue is sufficient or at least relevant for happiness. There\nare however several important modifications. (1) The entire structure\nis made dependent on God’s prevenient grace. True virtue\nguarantees true happiness, but there is no true virtue that is not a\ngift of grace.\n (2) Augustine accepts Cicero’s definition of virtue as the art\nof “living well” but emphatically rejects his equation of\nliving well and living happily, i.e., the Stoicizing claim that a\nvirtuous disposition is equivalent to happiness (De libero\narbitrio 2.50; De civitate dei 4.21; De moribus\n1.10; contrast Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 5.53). Our\npostlapsarian life on earth is inevitably the locus of sin and\npunishment, and even the saints are unable to overcome the permanent\ninner conflict between “the spirit” and “the\nflesh”, i.e., between good and evil volitions or rational and\nirrational desires in this life (De civitate dei 19.4,\nquoting Galatians 5:17). The perfect inner tranquility virtue strives\nfor will only be achieved in the afterlife. (3) Augustine replaces the\nancient definition of virtue as “right reason” (as in\nStoicism) or “activity in accordance with reason” (as in\nthe Aristotelian tradition) with a definition of virtue as love of God\nor, in later texts, as love of God and neighbor. Virtue is an inner\ndisposition or motivational habit that enables us to perform every\naction we perform out of right love.\n There are several catalogues of the traditional four cardinal virtues\nprudence, justice, courage and temperance that redefine these as\nvarieties of the love of God either in this life or in the eschaton\n(De moribus 1.25; Letter 155.12; cf. Letter\n155.16 for the cardinal virtues as varieties of love of the neighbor;\nDe libero arbitrio 1.27 for descriptions of the virtues in\nterms of good will). His briefest definition of virtue is\n“ordered love” (De civitate dei 15.22). This does\nnot mean that virtue becomes non-rational (for Augustine love and will\nare essential features of the rational mind; see\n 6.2 The Human Mind as an Image of God),\n but it does mean that it becomes essentially intentional. The\ncriterion of true virtue is that it is oriented toward God. Even if\nAugustine occasionally talks as if the four cardinal virtues could be\nadded to the Pauline or theological virtues of love, faith and hope to\nmake a sum of seven (Letter 171A.2), they are best taken as a\nsubdivision of love, the only one of the Pauline virtues that persists\nin the eschaton (Soliloquia 1.14). \nThese modifications have several interesting consequences. Even though\nAugustine postpones the happiness that is the reward of virtue to the\nafterlife, he does not make virtue a means to an end in the sense that\nvirtue becomes superfluous when happiness is reached. To the contrary,\nhe insists that virtue will persist in the eschaton where it will be\ntransformed into eternal unimpeded fruition of God and of the neighbor\nin God. Then it will indeed be its own reward and identical with\nhappiness (Letter 155.2; 12). Both eschatological virtue and\nvirtue in this life are thus love of God; they only differ in that the\nlatter is subject to hindrances and temptation. For this reason, those\nwho have true love of God—e.g., Christian martyrs—are\nhappy already in this life, at least in hope (e.g.,\nConfessiones 10.29; Tornau 2015). Augustine’s\ndescription of eschatological and non-eschatological virtues\n(Letter 155) is partly modelled on the Neoplatonic doctrine\nof the scale of virtues with its ascending hierarchy of social or\ncivic, purificatory and contemplative virtues (Tornau 2013; Dodaro\n2004a: 206–212; Dodaro 2004b). When analyzing virtue in this\nlife, Augustine takes up the Stoic distinction, familiar to him from\nCicero (De officiis 1.7–8), between a virtue’s\nfinal end (finis) and its appropriate action\n(officium; cf., e.g., Contra Iulianum 4.21; De\ncivitate dei 10.18). The appropriate action that characterizes\nvirtue in this life but is no longer needed in eternal bliss is to\nsubdue the lower parts of soul to reason and to resist the temptations\nthat emerge from the permanent conflict between good and bad volitions\n(as it were, a permanent “akratic” state; see\n 7.4 Will and Freedom)\n that results from our fallen condition (De civitate dei\n19.4). As the examples of the best philosophers and the heroes of\nRome’s glorious past teach, whom Augustine regularly accuses of\nlove of glory, these actions may easily spring from other motivations\nthan the true love of God. Augustine therefore distinguishes between\ntrue (i.e., Christian) virtue that is motivated by love of God and\n“virtue as such” (virtus ipsa: De civitate dei\n5.19) that performs the same appropriate actions but is, in the last\nresort, guided by self-love or pride (ib. 5.12; 19.25). Among other\nthings, this distinction underpins his solution of the so-called\nproblem of pagan virtue (Harding 2008; Tornau 2006b; Dodaro 2004a: 27–71; Rist 1994:\n168–173) because it permits ascribing virtue in a meaningful\nsense to pagan and pre-Christian paradigms of virtue like Socrates\nwithout having to admit that they were eligible for salvation. If a\n“teleological” perspective on virtue is adopted that\nexclusively focuses on ends, the virtues of the pagan must be judged\nvices rather than virtues and will be punished accordingly (De\ncivitate dei 19.25, the passage from which the non-Augustinian\nphrase that pagan virtues are “splendid vices” seems to be\nderived; see Irwin 1999). An “operative” perspective\nhowever reveals that as far as appropriate actions are concerned,\nvirtuous non-Christians differ from the foolish and wicked but are\nindistinguishable from virtuous Christians. From this point of view,\nSocrates is closer to Paul than to Nero, even though his virtue will\nnot bring him happiness, i.e., eternal bliss. That he envisages a\nperspective on virtue that abstracts from the causal nexus of virtue\nand happiness is perhaps Augustine’s most significant departure\nfrom ancient eudaimonism. \nLove is a crucial and overarching notion in Augustine’s ethics.\nIt is closely related to virtue\n and often used synonymously with will (e.g., De trinitate\n15.38; in the cogito-like arguments, love and will are\ninterchangeable, cf. De civitate dei 11.27 with\nConfessiones 13.12) or intention (intentio).\nAugustine’s basic text is, of course, the biblical command to\nlove God and neighbor (Matthew 22.37; 39), which he is however\nprepared, throughout his life, to interpret in terms of Platonic\nerotic love (Rist 1994: 148–202). As in the Symposium\nand in Plotinus (Enneads I.6), love is a force in our souls\nthat attracts us to the true beauty we find nowhere else but in and\nabove ourselves; it drives us to ascend from the sensible to the\nintelligible world and to the cognition and contemplation of God\n(Confessiones 10.8–38, esp. 38). Even Christian\nfraternal love can be described, in a manner reminiscent of the\nPhaedrus, as a kind of seduction through another’s real\nor assumed righteousness (De trinitate 9.11). In a more\ngeneral way, love means the overall direction of our will (positively)\ntoward God or (negatively) toward ourselves or corporeal creature\n(De civitate dei 14.7; Byers 2013: 88–99;\n217–231). The former is called love in a good sense\n(caritas), the latter cupidity or concupiscence\n(cupiditas), i.e., misdirected and sinful love (De\ndoctrina christiana 3.16). The root of sin is excessive self-love\nthat wants to put the self in the position of God and is equivalent\nwith pride (De civitate dei 14.28). It must be distinguished\nfrom the legitimate self-love that is part of the biblical commandment\nand strives for true happiness by subordinating the self to God\n(O’Donovan 1980). In his earlier work, Augustine has some\ndifficulties incorporating love of neighbor into the Platonic and\neudaimonist framework of his thinking (De doctrina christiana\n1.20–21, see\n 7.1 Happiness).\n After 400, in the context of his reflections on the Trinity and his\nexegesis of the First Epistle of John (esp. 1 John 4:8; 16, “God\nis love”), he finds the solution that love is by its very nature\nself-reflexive. In loving our neighbors, we of necessity love that\nlove which enables us to do so itself, which is none other than God;\nlove of God and love of neighbor are, accordingly, co-extensive and,\nultimately, identical (De trinitate 8.12; In epistulam\nIohannis ad Parthos tractatus decem 9.10). Right and perverse\nlove or intention—charity or concupiscence—thus becomes\nthe predominant and even the single criterion of moral evaluation;\nAugustine’s ethics may in this sense be labeled intentionalist\n(cf. Mann 1999 on Augustine’s “inner-life ethics”).\nHe keenly insists that each and every action, even if it is externally\ngood and impressive, can be motivated either by a good or an evil\nintention, by right or perverse love, by charity or pride. This goes\nfor the actions prescribed by the Sermon of the Mount and even for\nmartyrdom (In epistulam Iohannis tractatus decem 8.9, partly\nrelying on 1 Corinthians 13:3). It is therefore impossible to give\ncasuistic rules for external moral behavior. The only thing possible\nis the general recommendation to “Love and do what you\nwill” (ib. 7.8), i.e., to take care that the inner disposition\nor intention behind one’s actions is love of God and neighbor\nand not self-love or pride. It is important not to misunderstand this\nas moral subjectivism, which Augustine’s ontological and ethical\nassumptions exclude. He never excuses evil deeds done “with the\nbest intentions” or with a subjectively pure conscience, and he\ndoes allow for actions that are always condemnable because they cannot\npossibly result from love, such as heresy. In a sense, his ideal agent\nis a successor of the Stoic and Neoplatonic sage, who always acts out\nof inner virtue or perfect rationality (the latter Augustine replaces\nwith true love) but adapts his outward actions to the external\ncircumstances (cf. Sextus Empiricus, Adversus Mathematicos\n11.200–201 = 59 G Long-Sedley; Diogenes Laertius 7.121;\nPorphyry, Sententiae 32). Augustine’s intentionalism\nhas, however, the ambivalent implication that, since love and will\ninevitably belong to the privacy of the mind, the inner motives for a\nperson’s external agency are unknowable to anyone except the\nagent herself and God. On the one hand, this limits the authority of\nother people—including those endowed with worldly power or an\necclesiastical office—to pass moral judgments. Augustine\nrepeatedly recommends withholding judgment so as to preserve humility\n(De civitate dei 1.26; Sermon 30.3–4). On the\nother hand, Augustine makes our inner motivational and moral life\nopaque even to ourselves and fully transparent only to God\n(Confessiones 10.7; In Iohannis evangelium tractatus\n32.5). We can never be fully sure about the purity of our intentions,\nand even if we were, we could not be sure that we will persist in\nthem. All human beings are therefore called to constantly scrutinize\nthe moral status of their inner selves in a prayerful dialogue with\nGod (as it is dramatized in the Confessiones). Such\nself-scrutiny may well be self-tormenting; the obsession of Western\nChristianity with inner latent guilt here has its Augustinian roots.\nThe public staging of Augustine’s confession before God in the\nConfessiones may, among many other things, represent an\nattempt to remedy the loneliness of Christian self-scrutiny (cf.\nConfessiones 10.1–7). \nAugustine’s intentionalism also provides him with arguments in\nfavor of religious coercion. As the objective of right fraternal love\nis not the neighbor’s temporal well-being but his eternal\nhappiness or salvation, we must not passively tolerate our\nfellow-humans’ sins but should actively correct them if we can;\notherwise, our motivation would be inertia rather than love (In\nepistulam Iohannis ad Parthos tractatus decem 7.11; cf.\nLetter 151.11; Ad Simplicianum 1.2.18). Catholic\nbishops are therefore obliged to compel heretics and schismatics to\nre-enter the Catholic church even forcibly, just as a father beats his\nchildren when he sees them playing with snakes or as we bind a madman\nwho otherwise would fling himself down a precipice (Letter\n93.8; 185.7; and Letter 93.1–10 in general). Obviously,\nthis is a paternalistic argument that presupposes superior insight in\nthose who legitimately wield coercive power. While this may be\nacceptable in the case of the Church, which according to\nAugustine’s ecclesiology is the body of Christ and the\nembodiment of fraternal love, it turns out to be problematic when it\nis transferred to secular rulers (Augustine rarely does this, but cf.\nLetter 138.14–15). And as even the Church in this world\nis a mixed body of sinners and saints (see\n 8. History and Political Philosophy),\n it may be asked how individual bishops can be sure of their good\nintentions when they use religious force (Rist 1994: 242–245).\nAugustine does not address this problem, presumably because most of\nhis relevant texts are propagandistic defenses of coercion against the\nDonatists. \nThough other Latin philosophers, especially Seneca, had made use of\nthe concept of will (voluntas) before Augustine, it has a\nmuch wider application in his ethics and moral psychology than in any\npredecessor and covers a broader range of phenomena than either\nAristotelian boulesis (roughly, rational choice) or Stoic\nprohairesis (roughly, the fundamental decision to lead a good\nlife). Augustine comes closer than any earlier philosopher to positing\nwill as a faculty of choice that is reducible neither to reason nor to\nnon-rational desire. It has therefore been claimed that Augustine\n“discovered” the will (Dihle 1982: ch. 6; Kahn 1988;\ncontrast Frede 2011: 153–174 who, mainly on the basis of De\nlibero arbitrio, emphasizes Augustine’s indebtedness to\nStoicism). Augustine admits both first-order and second-order\nvolitions, the latter being acts of the liberum voluntatis\narbitrium, the ability to choose between conflicting first-order\nvolitions (Stump 2001; Horn 1996; den Bok 1994). Like desires,\nfirst-order volitions are intentional or object-directed and operate\non all levels of the soul. Like memory and thought, will is a\nconstitutive element of the mind (see\n 6.2 The Human Mind as an Image of God).\n It is closely related to love and, accordingly, the locus of moral\nevaluation. We act well or badly if and only if our actions spring\nfrom a good or evil will, which is equivalent to saying that they are\nmotivated by right (i.e., God-directed) or perverse (i.e.,\nself-directed) love (De civitate dei 14.7).\n With this basic idea in view, Augustine defends the passions or\nemotions against their Stoic condemnation as malfunctions of rational\njudgment by redefining them more neutrally as volitions\n(voluntates) that may be good or bad depending on their\nintentional objects (De civitate dei 9.4–5; 14.9;\nWetzel 1992: 98–111; Byers 2012b). The mechanics of the will in\nAugustine’s moral psychology is strongly indebted to the Stoic\ntheory of assent, which it however modifies in at least one respect.\nAs in Stoicism, the will to act is triggered by an impression\ngenerated by an external object (visum). To\nthis the mind responds with an appetitive motion that urges us to\npursue or to avoid the object (e.g., delight or fear). But only when\nwe give our inner consent to this impulse or withhold it, does a will\nemerge that, circumstances permitting, results in a corresponding\naction. The will is the proper locus of our moral responsibility\nbecause it is neither in our power whether an object presents itself\nto our senses or intellect nor whether we take delight in it (De\nlibero arbitrio 3.74; Ad Simplicianum 1.2.21), and our\nattempts to act externally may succeed or fail for reasons beyond our\ncontrol. The only element that is in our power is our will or inner\nconsent, for which we are therefore fully responsible. Thus, a person\nwho has consented to adultery is guilty even if his attempt actually\nto commit it is unsuccessful, and a victim of rape who does not\nconsent to the deed keeps her will free of sin even if she feels\nphysical pleasure (De civitate dei 1.16–28). Augustine\ntherefore defines sin as “the will to keep or pursue something\nunjustly” (De duabus animabus 15). The second stage in\nthe above structure, the involuntary appetitive motion of the soul, is\nreminiscent of the Stoic “first motions”, but it also\ncorresponds to the “impulse”, which in Stoicism does not\nprecede consent but follows it and immediately results in action.\nTemptations of this kind are, in Augustine, not personal sins but due to\noriginal sin, and they haunt even the saints. Our will must be freed\nby divine grace to resist them (Contra Iulianum 6.70; see, on\nthis theory and its Stoic and Platonic background, Byers 2013:\n100–150; J. Müller 2009: 157–161; Sorabji 2000:\n372–384; Rist 1994: 176–177). \nAugustine’s thinking about free will (liberum arbitrium\nor liberum voluntatis arbitrium) undergoes some development\nduring his career. In the 390s, opposing the dualistic fatalism of the\nManicheans, he uses the cogito-like argument (see\n 5.1 Skepticism and Certainty)\n to demonstrate that we are responsible for our volitions because we\nare as certain that we will as we are certain that we exist and think\n(De duabus animabus 13; De libero arbitrio 3.3;\nConfessiones 7.5; S. Harrison 1999). A contemporaneous\ndefinition of will as a movement of soul toward some object of desire\nemphasizes the absence of external constraint, and the ensuing\ndefinition of sin as an unjust volition (see above) seems to endorse\nthe principle of alternative possibilities (De duabus\nanimabus 14–15). In De libero arbitrio, free will\nappears as the condition of possibility of moral goodness and hence as\na great good itself; but as it is not an absolute good (which is God\nalone) but only an intermediate one, it is liable to misuse and,\nhence, also the source of moral evil (De libero arbitrio\n2.47–53). In his early exegesis of Paul’s chapter on\ndivine election (Romans 9), Augustine is keen to establish that Paul\ndid not abolish free will (Expositio quarundam propositionum ex\nepistula apostoli ad Romanos 13–18). With all this,\nAugustine is basically in harmony with the traditional view of early\nChristian theology and exegesis, which is still adopted in the 420s by\nJulian of Aeclanum when he blames Augustine for having fallen back\ninto Manichean fatalism and quotes his early definitions against him\n(Julian, Ad Florum, in Contra Iulianum opus\nimperfectum 1.44–47). Things change with Ad\nSimplicianum 1.2 and the Confessiones. By c. 400 CE,\nAugustine had come to the conclusion that our ability to make choices\nwas seriously impaired by the fallen condition of humankind and that\nit made little sense to talk about free will without reference to\ngrace. The optimistic-sounding claim in the first book of De\nlibero arbitrio (1.25–26; 29) that it is in our power to be\ngood as soon as we choose to be good because “nothing is as\ncompletely in our will as will itself” was probably never the\nwhole story; already in book 3 of the same work Augustine says that\nthe cognitive and motivational deficiencies caused by Adam’s sin\n(“ignorance and difficulty”, ib. 3.52; S. Harrison 2006:\n112–130) seriously compromise our natural ability to choose the\ngood, and in his later, especially anti-Pelagian work he radicalizes\nthis to the idea that original sin makes us unable to completely\nsubdue our sinful volitions as long as we live, so that we live in a\npermanent state of “akrasia” or weakness of will (De\nnatura et gratia 61–67; De civitate dei 19.4;\nDe nuptiis et concupiscentia 1.35). But he never questions\nthe principle that we have been created with the natural ability to\nfreely and voluntarily choose the good, nor does he ever deny the\napplicability of the cogito argument to the will (cf. De civitate\ndei 5.10) or doubt that our volitions are imputable to us. What\ngrace does is to restore our natural freedom; it does not compel us to\nact against our will. What this means is best illustrated by the\nnarrative of Confessiones 8 (for particularly lucid\ninterpretations, see Wetzel 1992: 126–138; J. Müller 2009:\n323–335). Immediately before his conversion Augustine suffers\nfrom a “divided will”, feeling torn apart between the will\nto lead an ascetic Christian life and the will to continue his\nprevious, sexually active life. Though he identifies with the former,\nbetter will rather than with the latter that actually torments him, he\nis unable to opt for it because of his bad habits, which he once\nacquired voluntarily but which have by now transformed into a kind of\naddictive necessity (ib. 8.10–12). Earlier philosophical\ntraditions would have interpreted this “akratic” state as\na conflict of reason and desire, and Manichean dualism would have\nattributed Augustine’s bad will to an evil substance present in\nbut foreign to the soul, but Augustine insists that both wills were\nindeed his own. Using medical metaphors reminiscent of Hellenistic\nmoral philosophy, he argues that his will lacked the power of free\nchoice because the disease of being divided between conflicting\nvolitions had weakened it (ib. 8.19; 21). His ability to choose is\nonly restored when, in the garden scene at the end of the book, his\nwill is reintegrated and healed by God’s call, which immediately\nfrees him to opt for the ascetic life (ib. 8.29–30). Before,\nwhen he had just continued his habitual way of life, this had been a\nnon-choice rather than a choice, even though, as Augustine insists, he\nhad done so voluntarily. In substance, this remained his line of\ndefense when, in the Pelagian controversy, he was confronted with the\ncharge that his doctrine of grace abolished free will (De spiritu\net littera 52–60; cf. De correptione et gratia 6).\nWhile the Pelagians thought that the principle of alternative\npossibilities was indispensable for human responsibility and divine\njustice, Augustine accepts that principle only for the first humans in\nparadise (Contra Iulianum opus imperfectum 1.47; 5.28;\n5.40–42 etc.). In a way, by choosing wrongly Adam and Eve have\nabandoned free will both for themselves and for all humankind.\nOriginal sin transformed our initial ability not to sin into an\ninability not to sin; grace can restore ability not to sin in this\nlife and will transform it into inability to sin in the next (De\ncivitate dei 22.30; De correptione et gratia 33). \nAugustine’s notion of will is closely related to his thinking on\nevil. The problem of the origin of evil (unde malum), he\nclaims, had haunted him from his youth (Confessiones 7.7). At\nfirst, he accepted the dualist solution of the Manicheans, which freed\nGod from the responsibility for evil but compromised his omnipotence\n(ib. 3.12; 7.3). After having encountered the books of the Platonists,\nAugustine rejected the existence of an evil substance and endorsed the\nNeoplatonic view (argued e.g., in Plotinus, Enneads I.8) that\nevil is in fact unsubstantial and a privation or corruption of\ngoodness. In his mature view, which was largely developed during his\nanti-Manichean polemics, everything that has being is good insofar as\nit has been created by God. There are of course different degrees of\ngoodness as well as of being (Letter 18.2),\n but everything that is real is good “in its degree”, and\nthe hierarchical order of reality is itself a good creation of God\n(Bouton-Touboulic 2004). Augustine therefore rejects Plotinus’\nview that prime matter is equivalent to prime evil, because the\nformlessness of matter is not pure negativity but a positive, and\nhence divinely created, capacity to receive forms\n(Confessiones 12.6; see\n 10. Creation and Time).\n A created being can be said to be evil if and only if it falls short\nof its natural goodness by being corrupted or vitiated; strictly\nspeaking, only corruption itself is evil, whereas the nature or\nsubstance or essence (for the equivalence of the terms see De\nmoribus 2.2) of the thing itself remains good\n(Confessiones 7.18; Contra epistulam fundamenti\n35.39 etc.; for a systematic account, De natura boni\n1–23; Schäfer 2002: 219–239). While this theory can\nexplain physical evil relatively easily either as a necessary feature\nof hierarchically ordered (corporeal) reality (De ordine\n2.51), as a just punishment of sin, or as part of God’s pedagogy\nof salvation (Letter 138.14), it leaves open the question of\nmoral evil or sin itself. Augustine answers by equating moral evil\nwith evil will\n and claims that the seemingly natural question of what causes evil\nwill is unanswerable. His most sustained argument to this effect is\nfound in his explanation of the fall of the devil and the evil angels,\na case that, being the very first occurrence of evil in the created\nworld, allows him to analyze the problem in its most abstract terms\n(De civitate dei 12.1–9; cf. already De libero\narbitrio 3.37–49; Schäfer 2002: 242–300;\nMacDonald 1999). The cause can neither be a substance (which, qua\nsubstance, is good and unable to cause anything evil) nor a will\n(which would in turn have to be an evil will in need of explanation).\nTherefore, an evil will has no “efficient” but only a\n“deficient” cause, which is none other than the\nwill’s spontaneous defection from God. The fact that evil agents\nare created from nothing and hence are not, unlike God, intrinsically\nunable to sin is a necessary condition of evil but not a sufficient\none (after all the good angels successfully kept their good will). In\nthis context Augustine, in an interesting thought experiment, imagines\ntwo persons of equal intellectual and emotional disposition of whom\none gives in to a temptation while the other resists it; from this he\nconcludes that the difference must be due to a free, spontaneous and\nirreducible choice of the will (De civitate dei 12.6). Here\nat least Augustine virtually posits the will as an independent mental\nfaculty. \nFrom the Middle Ages onwards, Augustine’s theology of grace has\nbeen regarded as the heart of his Christian teaching, and with good\nreason. As he points out himself, his conviction that human beings in\ntheir present condition are unable to do or even to will the good by\ntheir own efforts is his most fundamental disagreement with ancient,\nespecially Stoic, virtue ethics (De civitate dei 19.4;\nWolterstorff 2012). After and because of the disobedience of Adam and\nEve, we have lost our natural ability of self-determination, which can\nonly be repaired and restored by the divine grace that has manifested\nitself in the incarnation and sacrifice of Christ and works inwardly\nto free our will from its enslavement to sin.\n Confession of sins and humility are, therefore, basic Christian\nvirtues and attitudes; the philosophers’ confidence in their own\nvirtue that prevents them from accepting the grace of Christ is an\nexample of the sinful pride that puts the self in the place of God and\nwas at the core of the evil angels’ primal sin (De civitate\ndei 10.29). \nThe main inspiration for Augustine’s doctrine of grace is, of\ncourse, Paul (even though remarks on human weakness and divine help\nare not absent from the ancient philosophical tradition and especially\nfrom Platonism which had had a strong religious side from the\nbeginning; Augustine claims that with such utterances the Platonists\ninadvertently “confess” grace, cf. De civitate\ndei 10.29; 22.22). The radical view that the gifts of grace\ninclude not only external good works and the internal volitional\ndisposition that allows us to perform them but even the very first\nbeginnings of faith—in later technical terminology: that grace\nis not “cooperative” but radically\n“prevenient”—is however his own, and it took several\nyears to take shape in his thought. There is some debate on the stages\nof this development (for diverging reconstructions, see\nKarfíková 2012; Cary 2008a; Drecoll 2004–2010;\nDrecoll 1999; emphasis on the shifts in Augustine’s thinking:\nLettieri 2001; Flasch 1995; emphasis on continuity: C. Harrison 2006),\nbut it is generally agreed that Augustine’s doctrine of grace\nreached its mature form c. 395–397 with Ad Simplicianum\n1.2, after several years of intense reading and exegesis of Paul, and\ngained higher profile during the Pelagian controversy after 412.\nAugustine emphasizes the necessity of grace for both intellectual\nunderstanding and moral purification already in his earliest works\n(cf. esp. Soliloquia 1.2–6), but seems to have been\nconcerned to leave room for human initiative at least with respect to\nfaith and will (which would be in line with his concern, prominent\nthroughout the 390s, to safeguard human responsibility against\nManichean fatalism). In his early exegesis of Paul, he explains\nGod’s apparently gratuitous election of Jacob and rejection of\nEsau (Romans 9:10–13) with God’s foreknowledge of\nJacob’s faith and Esau’s infidelity (De diversis\nquaestionibus 68.5; Expositio quarundam propositionum ex\nepistula apostoli ad Romanos 60), a “synergistic”\nreading that relies on the assumption that salvation results from the\ncooperation of divine grace and human initiative and that had been\nstandard in early Christianity since Origen. This explanation is\nexplicitly rejected in Ad Simplicianum (1.2.5–6; 8;\n11). In this pivotal text, Augustine, true to his program of\n“faith seeking understanding”,\n attempts an exegesis of Romans 9:9–29 that satisfies the\nphilosophical requirements of God’s justice and benevolence\nwhile taking seriously the Pauline point that God’s election is\nentirely gratuitous and not occasioned by any human merit. The guiding\nintention of Romans 9, Augustine now says, is to preclude vainglory\nand pride (ib. 1.2.2) rather than to safeguard human responsibility\n(as had been his view in Expositio quarundam propositionum ex\nepistula apostoli ad Romanos 13–18). Augustine rehearses\nall possible reasons for God’s election of Jacob—his good\nworks, his good will, his faith and God’s foreknowledge of\neach—and discounts them all as amounting to an election from\nmerit rather than from grace. Starting from the primordial willingness\nto heed God’s call to faith, then, everything that is good in\nJacob must be considered a gift of divine grace. Free will has nothing\nto do with the reception of that gift because nobody can will to\nreceive a divine call to faith nor to respond positively to it so as\nto act accordingly and perform good works out of love (Ad\nSimplicianum 1.2.21; for the Stoically-inspired theory of agency\nbehind this see\n 7.4 Will and Freedom).\n While gratuitous election is, apart from being consoling,\ncomparatively easily squared with the axioms of divine benevolence,\njustice and omnipotence, its corollary, the equally gratuitous\nreprobation and damnation of Esau, is a serious philosophical problem\n(ib. 1.2.8). If it is not to violate the principle of God’s\njustice, it obliges us to assume some kind of evil in Esau, which is\nhowever excluded by Paul’s explicit statement to the contrary\n(Romans 9:11). Augustine’s solution is his doctrine of original\nsin. Both Jacob and Esau have inherited Adam’s guilt that his\nsin has spread over all humankind—a debt that God remits for\nJacob but exacts from Esau for reasons that, Augustine admits,\nnecessarily elude human understanding but are certainly just. Since\nthe Fall, humankind is nothing but a “lump of sin” that\nGod might justly have damned as a whole but from which he has chosen\nto save some individuals and to transform them into “vessels of\nmercy” (ib. 1.2.16, cf. Romans 9:23). The notion of original sin\nwas not invented by Augustine but had a tradition in African\nChristianity, especially in Tertullian.\n The view that original sin is a personally imputable guilt that\njustifies eternal damnation is, however, new with Ad\nSimplicianum and follows with logical necessity from the\nexegetical and philosophical claims made there about divine grace and\nelection (Flasch 1995; contrast De libero arbitrio\n3.52–55). The theory of Ad Simplicianum is illustrated,\nwith great philosophical acumen and psychological plausibility, in the\nConfessiones (especially bk. 8) and remains in place during\nthe Pelagian controversy till the end of Augustine’s life.\nCuriously, however, there are passages even in his anti-Pelagian work\nthat seem aimed at safeguarding freedom of choice and, accordingly,\nadmit of a “synergistic” reading (De spiritu et\nlittera 60; Cary 2008a: 82–86 and, for a different\ninterpretation, Drecoll 2004–2010: 207–208). After 412,\npressed by his Pelagian opponents, Augustine paid increasing attention\nto the mechanics of the transmission of original sin. The result was a\nquasi-biological theory that associated original sin closely with\nsexual concupiscence (see\n 9. Gender, Women and Sexuality). \nAn obvious implication of Augustine’s theory of grace and\nelection is predestination, a subject prominent in his last treatises\nagainst the Pelagians (e.g., De praedestinatione sanctorum,\nwritten after 426) but already implied in Ad Simplicianum.\nGod decides “before the constitution of the world”\n(Ephesians 1:4), i.e., (in Neoplatonic terms) in the non-temporal way\nthat matches his transcendent, eternal being (De civitate dei\n11.21; see also\n 10. Creation and Time),\n who will be exempted from the damnation that awaits fallen humankind\nand who will not (“double predestination”). This knowledge\nis however hidden to human beings, to whom it will only be revealed at\nthe end of times (De correptione et gratia 49).\n Until then, nobody, not even a baptized Christian, can be sure\nwhether grace has given her true faith and a good will and, if so,\nwhether she will persevere in it till the end of her life so as to be\nactually saved (De correptione et gratia 10–25; cf.\n 7.3 Love).\n Like the Stoic determinists before him, Augustine was confronted with\nthe objection that his doctrine of predestination made all human\nactivity pointless (“Lazy Argument”). While in Hellenism\nthis had largely been a theoretical issue, it acquired practical\nrelevance under the circumstances of monastic life: some North African\nmonks objected to being rebuked for their misbehavior with the\nargument that they were not responsible for not (yet) enjoying the\ngift of divine grace (De correptione et gratia 6). Taking up\nideas from De magistro\n and from Ad Simplicianum, Augustine replies that rebuke may\nwork as an external admonition, even as a divine calling, that helps\npeople turn to God inwardly and hence must not be withheld (De\ncorreptione et gratia 7–9). To the query that\npredestination undermines free will, Augustine gives his usual answer\nthat our freedom of choice has been damaged by original sin and must\nbe liberated by grace if we are to develop the good will necessary for\nvirtue and happiness. The medieval and modern debate on whether grace is\n“irresistible” is, therefore, to some extent\nun-Augustinian (cf. Wetzel 1992: 197–206); some, especially\nlater, texts do however present prevenient grace as converting the\nwill with coercive force (Contra duas epistulas Pelagianorum\n1.36–37; cf. already Ad Simplicianum 1.2.22; Cary\n2008a: 105–110). A problem related to predestination but not\nequivalent to it is divine foreknowledge (Matthews 2005: 96–104;\nWetzel 2001; for general discussion, Zagzebski 1991). Augustine\ninherits it from the Hellenistic discussion on future contingents and\nlogical determinism that is best documented in Cicero’s De\nfato. His solution is that while external actions may be\ndetermined, inner volitions are not. These are certainly foreknown by\nGod but exactly as what they are, i.e., as ours and as volitions and\nnot as external compulsions (De civitate dei 5.9–10;\ncf. De libero arbitrio 3.4–11). This argument is\nindependent of the doctrine of grace and original sin; it applies not\njust to fallen humankind but also to Adam and Eve and even to the\ndevil, whose transgression God had, of course, foreseen (De\ncivitate dei 11.17; 14.11). \nAugustine’s City of God is not a treatise of political\nor social philosophy. It is an extended plea designed to persuade\npeople “to enter the city of God or to persist in it”\n(Letter 2*.3). The criterion of membership in the city of God\n(a metaphor Augustine takes from the Psalms, cf. Psalm 86:3 quoted,\ne.g., in De civitate dei 11.1) and its antagonist, the\nearthly city, is right or wrong love.\n A person belongs to the city of God if and only if he directs his\nlove towards God even at the expense of self-love, and he belongs to\nthe earthly city or city of the devil if and only if he postpones love\nof God for self-love, proudly making himself his greatest good (De\ncivitate dei 14.28). The main argument of the work is that true\nhappiness, which is sought by every human being (ib. 10.1),\n cannot be found outside the city of God founded by Christ (cf. ib. 1,\nprologue). The first ten books deconstruct, in a manner reminiscent of\ntraditional Christian apologetics, the alternative conceptions of\nhappiness in the Roman political tradition (which equates happiness\nwith the prosperity of the Empire, thus falling prey to evil demons\nwho posed as the defenders of Rome but in fact ruined it morally and\npolitically) and in Greek, especially Platonic, philosophy (which,\ndespite its insight into the true nature of God, failed to accept the\nmediation of Christ incarnate out of pride and turned to false\nmediators, i.e., deceptive demons; bks. 8–10 have an interesting\ndisquisition on Platonic demonology). Augustine’s approach in\nthe second, positive half is Scriptural, creationist and\neschatological; this fact accounts for the specific character of its\nhistorical dimension. The history of the two cities begins with the\ncreation of the world and the defection of the devil and the sin of\nAdam and Eve (bks. 11–14); it continues with the\nprovidentially-governed vicissitudes of the People of Israel (the\nfirst earthly representative of the city of God) and, after the coming\nof Christ, of the Church (bks. 15–17, supplemented by a survey\nof the concurrent secular history from the earliest Eastern empires to\ncontemporary Rome in bk. 18); and it ends with the final destination\n(finis, to be understood both ethically as “ultimate\ngoal” and eschatologically as “end of times”) of the\ntwo cities in eternal damnation and eternal bliss (bks. 19–22;\nfor the structure and basic ideas of the City of God see\nO’Daly 1999). To a great extent, Augustine’s approach is\nexegetical; for him, the history of the city of God is, in substance,\nsacred history as laid down in Scripture (Markus 1970: 1–21).\nObviously, however, the heavenly and earthly cities must not be\nconfounded with the worldly institutions of the church and the state.\nIn history, each of these, and the Church in particular, is a mixed\nbody in which members of the city of God and the earthly city coexist,\ntheir distinction being clear only to God, who will separate the two\ncities at the end of times (ib. 1.35; 10.32 etc.). While the city of\nGod is a stranger or, at best, a resident alien (peregrinus:\nib. 15.1; 15.15) in this world and yearns for its celestial homeland,\nthe earthly city is not a unified body at all but lies in continuous\nstrife with itself because it is dominated by lust for power, the most\nwidespread form of the archetypal sin of pride in political and social\nlife (ib. 18.2). All this is in agreement with Augustine’s ideas\non predestination and grace;\n the history of the two cities is essentially the history of fallen\nhumanity. This dualistic account is however qualified when, in the\npart of the work that moves closest to social philosophy, Augustine\nanalyzes the attitude a Christian ought to adopt to the earthly\nsociety she inevitably lives in during her existence in this world.\nStarting, again, from the axiom that all human beings naturally desire\nwhat is good for them, he innovatively determines the goal that every\nindividual and every community in fact pursues as “peace”\n(pax), which, in his view, is largely equivalent with natural order and subordination. There are higher and lesser degrees of both individual\nand collective peace, e.g., the control of the emotions through\nreason, the subordination of body to soul, the subordination of\nchildren to parents in the family or a functioning hierarchical order\nin the state; at the top is “peace with God” or the\nsubordination of the human mind to God (ib. 19.13; Weissenberg 2005).\nThe lower forms of peace are relative goods and, as such, legitimately\npursued as long as they are not mistaken for the absolute good.\nPolitical peace and order is sought by members of the city of God and\nthe earthly city alike, but whereas the latter “enjoy” it\nbecause it is the greatest good they can attain and conceive of, the\nformer “use” it for the sake of their peace with God,\ni.e., in order that they and others may enjoy an unhindered Christian\nreligious life (ib. 19.17; 19.26; for “enjoyment” and\n“use” see\n 7.1 Happiness).\n Political peace is thus morally neutral insofar as it is a goal\ncommon to Christians and non-Christians. Augustine criticizes Cicero\nbecause he included justice in his definition of the state (Cicero,\nDe re publica 1.39) and thereby gave the earthly state an\ninherent moral quality that in reality is the privilege of the city of\nGod (De civitate dei 19.21). He himself prefers a more\npragmatic definition that makes the consensus about a common object of\n“love” (i.e., a common good agreed on by all members of\nthe community) the criterion of a state; the moral evaluation is not a\nmatter of the definition but depends on the evaluation of the goal it\npursues (cf.\n 7.3 Love).\n The early Roman Empire, which strove for glory, was more tolerable\nthan the Oriental empires that were driven by naked lust for power;\nthe best imaginable goal pursued by an earthly society would be\nperfect earthly peace (ib. 19.24; Weithman 2001: 243–4).\nChristians are allowed and even called to work for the well-being of\nthe societies they live in as long as they promote earthly peace for\nthe sake of their citizens’ and their own true happiness; in\npractice, this will usually mean furthering Christian religion (ib.\n5.25–6, on the Christian emperors Constantine and Theodosius;\nLetter 155.12; 16; Dodaro 2004b; Tornau 2013). But the doctrine\nof the two cities deliberately precludes any promotion of\nthe emperor or the empire to a providential and quasi-sacred rank. Not\neven Christians in power will be able to overcome the inherent\nwretchedness of fallen humanity (De civitate dei 19.6). Like\nthe vast majority of ancient Christian theologians, Augustine has\nlittle or no interest in social reform. Slavery, meaning unnatural\ndomination of humans over humans, is a characteristic stain of\npostlapsarian human life and, at the same time, an evil that is put to\ngood effects when it secures social order (ib. 19.15; Rist 1994:\n236–239). War results from sin and is the privileged means of\nsatisfying lust for power (ib. 18.2; 19.7). Nevertheless, Augustine\nwrote a letter to refute the claim that Christianity advocated a\npolitically impracticable pacifism (Letter 138). His\nChristian reinterpretation of the traditional Roman Just War Theory\nshould be read in the framework of his general theory of virtue and\npeace (Holmes 1999). To be truly just according to Augustinian\nstandards, a war would have to be waged for the benefit of the\nadversary and without any vindictiveness, in short, out of love of\nneighbor, which, in a fallen world, seems utopian (Letter\n138.14). Wars may however be relatively just if they are defensive and\nproperly declared (cf. Cicero, De officiis 1.36–37) or\ncommanded by a just authority even short of the special case of the\nwars of the People of Israel that were commanded by God himself\n(Contra Faustum 22.74–78). \nOutright misogyny is rare in Augustine, but he lived in a society and\nworked from a tradition—both Greco-Roman and\nJudeo-Christian—that took the natural and social subordination\nof women to men largely for granted (cf. Børresen 2013: 135\nand, for a sketch of the social and familial realities of late-antique\nRoman Africa, Rist 1994: 210–213; 246–247). Augustine\ninterprets the Genesis tale of the creation of woman (Genesis\n2:18–22) to mean that, Eve having been created as a helper to\nAdam and for the sake of reproduction, she was subordinate to him\nalready in paradise (De Genesi ad litteram 6.5.7; 9.5.9).\nThis situation is exacerbated by the Fall; under the conditions of\nfallen humankind, marriage is, for the wives, a kind of slavery that\nthey should accept with obedience and humility (as Monnica did; cf.\nConfessiones 9.19–20 and, on marriage in Augustine in\ngeneral, E. Clark 1996). In his early anti-Manichean exegesis of\nGenesis, he allegorizes man as the rational and woman as the\nnon-rational, appetitive parts of the soul (De Genesi contra\nManichaeos 2.15, cf. De vera religione 78; De Genesi\nad litteram 8.23.44; the pattern is well attested in the\nphilosophical tradition). On the other hand, he insists—as until\nthen few Christian theologians had done—that the meaning of the\nGenesis tale was not purely allegorical but that sexual\ndifferentiation had begun to exist in paradise and would persist in\nthe resurrected bodies of the blessed because it was a natural part of\nGod’s creation (De civitate dei 22.17). Following the\nGreek philosophical (in particular, Platonic) conviction that the soul\nand especially its highest, intellectual part is not gendered as well\nas the Pauline eschatological promise that in Christ “there is\nneither male nor female” (Galatians 3:28), Augustine argues that\nthe words of Genesis 1:26–27 on the human being having been\ncreated in the image of God imply that woman is human like man because\nshe has an intellectual soul and because it is not the gendered body\nbut the intellectual soul that makes the human being an image of God\n(De Genesi ad litteram 3.22.34; Børresen 2013:\n136–137; cf. also\n 6.2 The Human Mind as an Image of God;\n the view that woman is made in the image of God is far from\nuncontroversial in ancient Christianity). The inner tension of the\nview that woman is intellectually equal and, at the same time, by\nnature socially inferior to man makes itself felt in Augustine’s\nexegesis of Paul’s saying that women, but not men, should veil\nthemselves because man is made in the image of God (1 Corinthians\n11:7). Augustine compares man with theoretical and woman (the\n“helper” of Genesis 2:18) with practical reason and claims\nthat while theoretical and practical reason together or reason in its\nentirety is an image of God just as the human being as such is, in virtue\nof its reason, an image of God, practical reason alone, being directed toward corporeal\nthings and but a “helper” of theoretical reason, is not. (By implication, woman is an image of God qua human being, but not qua woman.) The\npractice enjoined by Paul is meant to signify this difference (De\ntrinitate 12.10–13). This exegesis safeguards the\ngodlikeness of woman against a widespread patristic consensus and, it\nappears, against Paul himself, but at the same time defends social\ninequality and even endows it with metaphysical and religious\nsignificance (Stark 2007a). \nTwo women figure prominently in Augustine’s literary output\n(Power 1995; G. Clark 2015): his mother, Monnica (her name appears\nonly in Confessiones 9.37), and his partner for fourteen years,\nthe mother of Adeodatus. In the dialogues of Cassiciacum, Monnica\nrepresents a philosophical way of life based on the natural intuitions\nof reason and on an unshakable Christian faith together with a life\naccording to the precepts of Christian morality (De beata\nvita 10; De ordine 1.31–32). She, and the\nuneducated but faithful in general, may not be able to reach happiness\nin this life by means of an ascent to the divine with the help of the\nliberal arts, but they will certainly see God “from face to\nface” in eternal bliss (De ordine 2.45–46).\nBehind this idealization may be the male Christian philosopher’s\nnostalgic desire for a “natural” holiness untainted by\nsecular occupation and learning (Brown 1988: ch. 13, on the Greek\ntheologians and bishops of the fourth century). Monnica’s\nprominence and idealization in the Confessiones has provoked\nmuch, and mostly fruitless, psychological speculation. Augustine\nrepresents her influence on his religious life as pervasive from his\nearliest years onwards and even compares her to the Mother Church\n(Confessiones 1.17). She embodies ideal Christian love of the\nneighbor (see\n 7.3 Love)\n in that she furthers Augustine’s Catholic faith with all her\nmeans (mostly, tears and prayer) and never indulges his Manicheism\ndespite her motherly affection (e.g., Confessiones 3.19).\nWith this she however combines, especially in the earlier books, more\nmundane motives, e.g., when she arranges a marriage for Augustine in\nthe hope of both fencing his sexual concupiscence and assisting his\nworldly career (ib. 6.23). Like the other human influences on\nAugustine reported in the Confessiones, she is used by God as\nan instrument of his grace in a way she neither foresees nor wills.\nOnly after Augustine’s conversion does she rise to saintly\nperfection, especially in the “vision of Ostia” when,\nshortly before her death, mother and son, after a long\nphilosophico-theological conversation, reach a sudden insight into\nwhat contemplation of the transcendent God in eternal bliss must be\nlike (ib. 9.24–25). The chapter on the dismissal of\nAdeodatus’ mother for the sake of an advantageous marriage (ib.\n6.25; Shanzer 2002; Miles 2007) has been unpalatable for many modern\nreaders. Yet what is unusual about it is not Augustine’s\nbehavior but the fact that he mentions it at all and, from hindsight,\nreflects on the pain it caused him. True to the deliberately\ncounter-intuitive and often provocative procedure of the\nConfessiones, he singles out an emotion that, then as now,\nmost people would have easily understood but which he nevertheless\ninterprets as a mark of his sinful state because it resulted from the\nloss of a female body he had, in a kind of mutual sexual exploitation,\nenjoyed for the sake of pleasure (Confessiones 4.2; for the\nunderlying defective view, common in antiquity, of erotic\nrelationships cf. Rist 1994: 249) instead of “enjoying”\nhis female neighbor “in God” and relating their mutual\nlove to him (cf.\n 7.1 Happiness;\n compare Augustine’s excessive grief about the friend of his\nyouth in Confessiones 4.9–11 and contrast his\npost-conversion mourning of Monnica, ib. 9.30–33). \nAugustine’s views on sexuality are most prominent in his\nanti-Pelagian treatises, where he develops a theory about the\ntransmission of original sin from the first couple in paradise to\nevery human being born since, making sexual concupiscence the prime\nfactor in the process (cf. E. Clark 1996 and 2000, who also takes into\naccount Augustine’s Manichean past). In Augustine’s\nethics, concupiscence (concupiscentia) does not have a\nspecifically sexual meaning but is an umbrella term that covers all\nvolitions or intentions opposed to right love (see\n\n Nisula 2012). The transgression of Adam and Eve did not consist\nin sexual concupiscence but in their disobedience, which, like the\nevil angels’ primal sin, was rooted in pride (see\n 7.5 Will and Evil).\n For this disobedience they, and all humankind with them, were\npunished with the disobedience of their own selves, i.e., the\nimpossibility of fully controlling their own appetites and volitions\nand the permanent akratic state (the “coveting of the flesh\nagainst the spirit”, in the words of Galatians 5:17) that marks\nfallen humanity. The inability of human beings to control their sexual\ndesires and even their sexual organs (witness the shameful experiences\nof involuntary male erection or of impotence: De civitate dei\n14.15–16) is just an especially obvious example. Unlike most\nearlier Christian writers, Augustine thought that there was sexual\nintercourse in paradise and that there would have been procreation\neven without the fall; he did not share the encratic ideas of some\nascetic circles who hoped to make good for the first sin through\nsexual abstinence, and he had comparatively moderate views on\nvirginity and sexual continence (De sancta virginitate;\nBørresen 2013: 138; Brown 1988: ch. 19). But he thought that\nAdam and Eve had been able to control their sexual organs voluntarily\nso as to limit their use to the natural purpose of procreation; in\nparadise, there had been sexuality but no concupiscence (De\ncivitate dei 14.21–23). Original sin had destroyed this\nideal state, and since then sexual concupiscence is an inevitable\nconcomitant of procreation—an evil that may be put to good use\nin legitimate marriage, where the purpose of sexual intercourse is the\nprocreation of children rather than bodily pleasure (De nuptiis et\nconcupiscentia 1.16; Contra Iulianum 3.15–16), but\nthat nevertheless subjects every newborn human being to the domination\nof the devil from which they need to be freed through baptism (De\nnuptiis et concupiscentia 1.25–26; for energetic criticism\nof Augustine’s views on concupiscence, inter alia\nbecause of their impact on the sex morals of modern Christianity, see\nPagels 1989, for moderate defense Lamberigts 2000). \nJust as the late-antique Platonists developed their cosmological\nthinking by commenting on Plato’s Timaeus,\nAugustine’s natural philosophy is largely a theory of creation\nbased on an exegesis of the opening chapters of Genesis, on which he\nwrote five extended, and occasionally diverging, commentaries (De\nGenesi contra Manichaeos; De Genesi ad litteram liber\nimperfectus; Confessiones 11–13; De Genesi ad\nlitteram; De civitate dei 11–14). The longest and\nmost important of them is the Literal Commentary on Genesis\n(De Genesi ad litteram). “Literal” does not mean\n“literalist” but denotes the hermeneutic assumption that\nthe text is really about the creation of the world (as opposed to a\nmoralist or prophetic allegorical reading of the kind proposed in\nAugustine’s early De Genesi contra Manichaeos; the two\napproaches are compatible because Augustine, like Origen and the\nJewish exegete Philo before him, believes in the existence of multiple\nlayers of meaning in Scripture; see De Genesi ad litteram\n1.1.1 and, in general, De doctrina christiana, bk. 3). In\nline with his epistemology of illumination and his theory of verbal\nsigns,\n Augustine takes the biblical creation tale as an\n“admonition” that prompts him to devise, with the help of\nthe “inner teacher”, a rational theistic cosmology based\non Trinitarian theology (for rejection of explanations that contradict\nthe findings of the natural philosophers or the laws of nature cf.,\ne.g., De Genesi ad litteram 2.9.21). In De Genesi ad\nlitteram, in the Confessiones and, to a lesser extent,\nin De civitate dei Augustine presents his exegesis in a\nquestioning manner and keeps the results open to revision. The reason\nis that, according to the hermeneutics developed especially in bk. 12\nof the Confessiones, the authorial intention of the\nScriptural text, or indeed of any text, cannot be recovered, so\nthat—given that the truthfulness of Scripture can be taken for\ngranted—different and even incompatible readings must be\nconsidered as adequate if they agree with what the text says and if\nthey are sanctioned by the truth which we access inwardly through\nreason and which is, ultimately, God himself (see esp.\nConfessiones 12.27; 43; De doctrina christiana 3.38\nwhere Augustine claims that the Holy Spirit providentially allowed for\na plenitude of Scriptural meanings in order to prompt different people\nto different aspects of the truth; Williams 2001; van Riel 2007; Dutton 2014: 175–179;\nand, on the epistemological foundations of this hermeneutics, Cary\n2008b: 135–138). The basic and recurrent features of\nAugustine’s cosmological thought are these (cf. Knuuttila 2001:\n103–109; Mayer 1996–2002, each with references): God does\nnot create in time but creates time together with changeable being\nwhile resting in timeless eternity himself (Confessiones\n11.16; De Genesi ad litteram 5.5.12; the distinction of\neternity and time is Platonic, cf. Timaeus 37c-38b; Plotinus,\nEnneads III.7.1). Creation occurs instantaneously; the seven\ndays of creation are not to be taken literally but are a didactic\nmeans to make plain the intrinsic order of reality\n(Confessiones 12.40; De Genesi ad litteram 1.15.29).\nLike the demiurge in the Timaeus, God creates out of\ngoodness, i.e., out of his good will and his gratuitous love for his\ncreation (De civitate dei 11.24). In creation, all three\npersons of the Trinity are active, with, roughly, the Father\naccounting for the existence, the Son (to whom, in Augustine’s\nreading, the opening words of Genesis, in principio, refer)\nfor the form or essence and the Holy Spirit for the goodness and\norderliness of every created being (Confessiones 11.11;\nDe civitate dei 11.24). As the causality of the Trinity makes\nitself felt everywhere in creation, Augustine likes to describe\ncreated beings in their relation to the divine cause in a triadic\nmanner, using, e.g., the categories “measure”,\n“form” and “peace/order” (e.g., De vera\nreligione 13; De natura boni 3; De civitate dei\n12.5; cf. Schäfer 2000 and, for a very thorough discussion, du\nRoy 1966). These “traces” of the Trinity in creation must\nnot be confused with the Trinitarian structure of the human intellect,\nwhich, alone among all created beings, is an image of God.\n Changeable being is not generated from God (which, according to the\nNicene Creed, is true only of the Son) but created out of nothing, a\nfact that partly accounts for its susceptibility for evil.\n More precisely, God “first” creates formless matter out\nof nothing (which is why matter in Augustine, unlike in the\nNeoplatonists, has a minimal ontological status; cf.\nConfessiones 12.6; Tornau 2014: 189–194) and\n“then” forms it by conveying to it the rational principles\n(rationes) that eternally exist in his mind (De diversis\nquaestionibus 46.2) or, as Augustine prefers to put it, in his\nWord, i.e., the Second Person of the Trinity. This formative process\nis Augustine’s exegesis of the biblical “word” of\nGod (Genesis 1:1 and John 1:1). Incorporeal and purely intellectual\nbeings, i.e., the angels, are created from intelligible matter which\nis created out of nothing and converted to the creator so as to be\nformed through the “hearing” of God’s word, i.e., by\ntheir contemplation of the Forms contained in God (De Genesi ad\nlitteram 1.4.9–1.5.11, an idea inspired by the Neoplatonic\npattern of abiding, procession and return). Corporeal being is created\nwhen the Forms or rational principles contained in God and\ncontemplated by the angels are even further externalized so as to\ninform not only intelligible but also physical matter (De Genesi\nad litteram 2.8.16; 4.22.39). \nAll this is the framework of Augustine’s famous meditation about\ntime in the Confessiones (11.17–41), whose context is\nan exegesis of Genesis and which constantly presupposes the\ndistinction of time and eternity (much has been written on this text,\nbut particularly illuminating treatments are Flasch 1993; Mesch 1998:\n295–343; Matthews 2005: 76–85; Helm 2014; Hoffmann 2017).\nAugustine opens the section with the question, “What is\ntime?” (Confessiones 11.17) but in fact has no\nintention of giving a definition of time. Whereas his accounts outside\nthe Confessiones center on cosmic or physical time, he here\nfocuses on how we experience time from a first-person perspective and\nwhat it means for us and our relationship to ourselves and to God to\nexist temporally. In this sense, the purpose of the book is ethical\nrather than cosmological. Augustine begins by observing that though of\nthe three familiar “parts” of time, past, present and\nfuture, none really exists (the past having ceased to exist, the\nfuture not existing yet, and the present being without extension),\ntime doubtless has reality for us. This is so because time is present\nto us in the form of our present memory of the past, our present\nattention to the present and our present expectation of the future\n(ib. 11.26). The phenomenal proof of this claim is the experience of\nmeasuring time by comparing remembered or expected portions of time to\neach other or of repeating a poem we know by heart, when, as we\nproceed, the words traverse our attention (the present), passing from\nexpectation (the future) to memory (the past; ib. 11.38). We would\nthus be unable to relate past, present and future events, to remember\nthe history of our own lives and even to be aware of our personal\nidentity if our being in time was not divided into memory, attention\nand expectation and, at the same time, unified by the connectedness\nand the simultaneous presence of these. This ambivalent state\nAugustine calls “a distention of the soul” (ib. 11.33;\n38–39, perhaps echoing Plotinus, Enneads III.7.11.41);\nthis is the closest Confessiones 11 comes to a definition of\ntime. The stability of this precarious unity is however dependent on\nthe higher unity of the eternal God—as the whole narrative of\nthe Confessiones teaches, we cannot make sense of the memory\nof our life unless we perceive the ceaseless presence of God’s\nprovidence and grace in it. Toward the end of the book, Augustine\nintroduces the Pauline “straining forward to what lies\nahead” (Philippians 3:12–14)—as he reads it, the\norientation or “intention” of the soul toward God—as\na counterpoint to the soul’s distention in time and concludes\nwith an exhortation to turn from the dispersion of temporal existence\nto the timeless eternity of God which alone guarantees truth and\nstability (ib. 11.39–41). \nAugustine’s impact on later philosophy is as enormous as it is\nambivalent (for an overview, see Fuhrer 2018a: 1742–1750; for\nall questions of detail, Pollmann (ed.) 2013; for De\ntrinitate, Kany 2007). Although he was soon accepted as a\ntheological authority and consensus with him was regarded as a\nstandard of orthodoxy throughout the Middle Ages and beyond, his\nviews—or more precisely, the right way of interpreting\nthem—continued to trigger controversies. In the ninth century\nthe monk Gottschalk took Augustine’s doctrine of grace to imply\ndouble predestination (a term coined by him); he was opposed by John\nScotus Eriugena. The philosophical discourse of early scholasticism\n(11th–12th centuries) largely centered on\nAugustinian themes. Anselm’s proof of the existence of God\ndevelops the argument of De libero arbitrio, bk. 2; the\nethicists’ debates on will and conscience rest on the\nassumptions of Augustine’s moral intentionalism, and\nAbelard’s view that ethics is universal and applicable to both\nhuman and divine agency may be read as a response to the problems in\nAugustine’s theory of divine election. With the growing\ninfluence of Aristotle from the thirteenth century onwards, Augustine\ncame to be interpreted in Aristotelian terms that had largely been\nunknown to himself. Thomas Aquinas and others had little interest in\nAugustine’s Platonism, and there was a certain tension between\nthe medieval tendency to look for a teachable philosophical and\ntheological system in his texts and his own way of philosophical\ninquiry that was shaped by the ancient tradition and left room for\ntentative argument and was open to revision. Medieval political\nAugustinianism projected the conflict of the Two Cities onto the\nChurch and the State. Martin Luther (1483–1546) agrees with\nAugustine on the absolute gratuitousness of grace but does not follow\nthe Augustinian (and scholastic) ideal of intellectus fidei\nand makes faith in the Gospel the decisive condition of salvation. In\nhis debate with Erasmus on free will, he voices a quite Augustinian\npessimism about human freedom. The variety of Protestantism that was\ninaugurated by Jean Calvin (1509–1564) accepts double\npredestination. In the seventeenth century Descartes’ cogito was\nsoon recognized as an Augustinian idea and triggered a refreshed\ninterest in Augustine’s epistemology. In the same epoch, the\nJansenist movement put forward a radical interpretation of\nAugustine’s theology of grace and justification that was\nfiercely combated by the Catholic Church. In the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries, the leading philosophers of Enlightenment,\nGerman Idealism and Romanticism showed little interest in Augustine,\nand even, in the case of Nietzsche, outright contempt. He remained,\nhowever, an important figure in Neoscholasticism or Neothomism, a\nphilosophical reaction of Catholic philosophers against Enlightenment\nand Idealism which continued to inform Catholic theological\nscholarship on Augustine till the 1950s and beyond. In the twentieth\ncentury, Augustine’s philosophy of time (Confessiones\n11) received enormous and unprecedented philosophical attention from\nthinkers like Edmund Husserl (1859–1938), Martin Heidegger\n(1889–1976) and Paul Ricœur (1913–2005), some of\nwhom credited Augustine with their own subjectivist understanding of\ntime. Hannah Arendt (1906–1975) wrote her doctoral dissertation\non Augustine’s philosophy of love and blamed him, not uncommonly\nfor her epoch, for degrading love of neighbor to an instrument of\npersonal happiness. Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) takes issue\nwith what he considers Augustine’s view of language and language\nacquisition throughout his analysis of language in the\nPhilosophical Investigations. Postmodernist thinkers\n(Jean-Luc Marion, John Milbank) have set Augustine’s notion of\nself, in which love is perceived as an integral part, against the\npurported egoism and isolation of the Cartesian subject, which is\nconsidered the hallmark and, as it were, the birth defect of\nmodernity. Like their medieval predecessors, modern and postmodern\nappropriations of Augustine are selective and inevitably conditioned\nby contemporary concerns, sometimes resulting in secularized readings.\nContemporary Western culture has little sympathy for Augustine’s\nyearning for an inner divine light or for his less than optimistic\nviews about human autonomy and the secular. Nevertheless, the richness\nof his thought continues to fascinate readers. ","contact.mail":"christian.tornau@uni-wuerzburg.de","contact.domain":"uni-wuerzburg.de"}]
