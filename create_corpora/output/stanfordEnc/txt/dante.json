He was one of the most\nlearned Italian laymen of his day, intimately familiar with\nAristotelian logic and natural philosophy, theology, and classical\nliterature. He is, of course, most famous for having written the\nDivine Comedy, but in his poetry as well as his philosophical\ntreatises and other writings, he freely mingles and synthesizes\nphilosophical and theological language as well extensive references\nand allusions to scripture and classical and contemporary poetry.\nWhile his contributions to world literature and other artistic genres are universally\nacknowledged, his theological imagination has also remained\ninfluential from his own time to the present day. His philosophical\nlegacy, by comparison, remains more difficult to assess, though his\nwritings provide, at the very least, a powerful tool for the study of\nthe landscape of late medieval and Renaissance philosophy. \n\nBecause Dante’s poetic persona looms so large in his writings,\nvery little can be said about his biography that does not, in some\nway, depend upon an interpretations of his continual re-crafting of\nthat persona. It is generally accepted that Dante was born in 1265 in\nFlorence. If it is true that he was born under the sign of\nGemini—as reported in Paradiso 22.112–120—then his\nbirthday would have been sometime in May or June of that year.\nAccording to the testimony of his own writings, at the age of nine he\nmet for the first time the eight-year-old Beatrice Portinari, whom,\nsubsequent to her death in 1290, Dante consistently invoked as the key\ninspiration for his poetic vision and personal salvation.  \nAlso according to the testimony of his own writing, Dante believed\nhimself to be—or at least wished for his readers to believe him\nto be—a descendant of the ancient Roman families who founded\nFlorence. In Paradiso 15, for instance, he claims that his\ngreat-great-grandfather Cacciaguida had been knighted by emperor\nConrad and died fighting as a crusader in the Holy Land—a claim\nthat a recent biographer has noted “might be traced back to\nDante’s desire, particularly apparent at the time of the\nCommedia, to give dignity to a family which, in reality,\ncould boast no noble roots nor any knights among it, least of all of\nimperial investiture” [Santagata (2016), 20].  \nWhile it remains difficult to separate myth from fact in\nreconstructing Dante’s biography, it is nevertheless undoubtedly\ntrue that Dante’s philosophical perspective and poetic ambitions\nwere powerfully shaped by the context of his upbringing in late\nthirteenth-century Florence. Between 1285, when he married and began a\nfamily, and 1302, when he was exiled from Florence, he was active in\nthe cultural and civic life of Florence, served as a soldier, and held\nseveral political offices. Within this context, despite his own\norigins in a family possessing only modest wealth, Dante’s\nparticipation in Florentine politics played a crucial role in the\ndevelopment of his philosophical thinking as well as in advancing his\npoetic ambitions.  \nSince the early thirteenth century, two great factions, the Guelfs and\nthe Ghibellines, had competed for control of Florence. The Guelfs,\nwith whom Dante was allied, were identified with Florentine political\nautonomy, and with the interests of the Papacy in its long struggle\nagainst the centralizing ambitions of the Hohenstaufen emperors, who\nwere supported by the Ghibellines. After Charles of Anjou, with the\nblessing of the Papacy and strong Guelf support, defeated Hohenstaufen\narmies at Benevento (1265/6) and Tagliacozzo (1268), the Guelfs became\nthe dominant force in Florence. By the end of the century, the Guelfs\nwere themselves riven by faction, grounded largely in family and\neconomic interests, but determined also by differing degrees of\nloyalty to the papacy. \nIn 1301, when conflict erupted between the “Blacks,” the\nfaction most strongly committed to aristocratic and papal interests,\nand the wealthier but less illustrious “Whites,” Pope\nBoniface VIII instigated a partisan settlement which allowed the\nBlacks to exile the White leadership, of whom Dante was was a member.\nHe never returned to Florence, and played no further role in public\nlife, though he remained passionately interested in Italian politics,\nand became virtually the prophet of world empire in the years leading\nup to the coronation of Henry VII of Luxembourg as head of the Holy\nRoman Empire (1312). The development of Dante’s almost messianic\nsense of the imperial role is hard to trace, but it was doubtless\naffected by his bitterness over what he saw as the autocratic and\ntreacherous conduct of Pope Boniface, and a growing conviction that\nonly a strong central authority could bring order to Italy. \nDuring the next twenty years Dante lived in several Italian cities,\nspending at least two long periods at the court of Can Grande della\nScala, lord of Verona. In 1319 he moved from Verona to Ravenna, where\nhe completed the Paradiso, and where he died in 1321. \nDante’s engagement with philosophy cannot be studied apart from\nhis vocation as a writer—as a poet whose theme, from first to\nlast, is the significance of his love for Beatrice, but also as an\nintellectual strongly committed to raising the level of public\ndiscourse. After his banishment he addressed himself to Italians\ngenerally, and devoted much of his long exile to transmitting the\nriches of ancient thought and learning, as these informed contemporary\nscholastic culture, to an increasingly sophisticated lay readership in\ntheir own vernacular. \nThis project was Dante’s contribution to a long-standing Italian\ncultural tradition. His reading in philosophy began, he tells us, with\nCicero and Boethius, whose writings are in large part the record of\ntheir dedication to the task of establishing a Latinate intellectual\nculture in Italy. The Convivio and the De vulgari\neloquentia preserve also the somewhat idealized memory of the\nNeapolitan court of Frederick II of Sicily (1195–1250) and his\nson Manfred (1232–66), intellectuals in their own right as well\nas patrons of poets and philosophers, whom Dante viewed as having\nrevived the ancient tradition of the statesman-philosopher [Van Cleve,\n299–332]. Dante himself probably studied under Brunetto\nLatini (1220–94), whose encyclopedic Livres dou Tresor\n(1262–66), written while Brunetto was a political exile in\nFrance, provided vernacular readers with a compendium of the Liberal\nArts and a digest of Aristotelian ethical and political thought\n[Meier; Imbach (1993), 37–47; Davis (1984), 166–97]. \nBut the fullest medieval embodiment of Dante’s ideal the corpus\nof his own writings—especially his poetic writings, but, above\nall, his Divine Comedy. In these works we see for the first\ntime a powerful thinker, solidly grounded in Aristotle, patristic\ntheology, and thirteenth-century scholastic debate, but one who brings\nthese resources directly to bear on educating his countrymen in their\nown vernacular with the intention of inspiring them to pursue the\nhappiness that rewards the philosopher. \nThough he evidently did not begin serious study of philosophy until\nhis mid-twenties, Dante had already been intellectually challenged by\nthe work of a remarkable group of poets, practitioners of what he\nwould later recall as the dolce stil novo, in whose hands a\nlyric poetry modelled on the canso of the Provençal\ntroubadours became a vehicle for serious enquiry into the nature of\nlove and human psychology. A generation earlier, Guido Guinizzelli\n(1230–76) had puzzled contemporaries with poems treating love in\nterms of the technicalities of medicine and the cosmology of the\nschools, while celebrating in quasi-mystical language his lady’s\npower to elevate the spirit of her poet-lover (Al cor gentil\nrempaira sempre amore, 41–44, 47–50): \nSplende ’n la intelligenzïa del cielo\n\nDeo Criator più che ’n nostr’ occhi ’l sole;\n\nella intende suo fattor oltra ’l cielo,\n\ne ’l ciel volgiando, a Lui obedir tole;\n\n…\n\ncosì dar dovria, al vero,\n\nla bella donna, poi che ’n gli occhi splende\n\ndel suo gentil, talento\n\nche mai di lei obedir non si disprende. \n[God the creator shines in the intelligence of heaven\n\nmore than the sun in our eyes,\n\nand she understands her maker beyond the heaven\n\nand, as she turns the heaven, obeys Him\n\n…\n\nSo truly should the beautiful lady,\n\nwhen she shines on the eyes\n\nof her noble lover, impart the desire\n\nthat he will never fail in his obedience to her.] \nThe bella donna, exerting on her lover a power derived from\nthe participation of her understanding in the divine, plays the role\nof the celestial intelligenzïa, who transmits the influence of\nthe First Mover to the universe at large. The poet is thus caught up\nin a circular process through which his understanding, like theirs, is\ndrawn toward the divine as manifested in the lady’s divinely\ninspired radiance. For Guinizelli this exploitation of the idea of\ncelestial hierarchy is perhaps only a daring poetic conceit. For Dante\nit will become a means to the articulation of his deepest intuitions.\n \nAmong Dante’s contemporaries, however, the single strongest\ninfluence on his early poetry was Guido Cavalcanti, renowned not only\nas a poet, but also for his knowledge of natural philosophy. His great\ncanzone, “Donna mi prega,” which became\nthe subject of learned Latin commentaries, deals with ideas commonly\nassociated with the “radical Aristotelianism” or\n“Averroism” of his day. The purpose of this astonishing\npoem is to describe in precise philosophical terms\n(“naturale dimostramento”) the experience of\nlove. \nFor Guido there is an absolute cleavage between the sensory and\nintellectual aspects of the response to a loved object. Once the\nphantasma of the object becomes an abstracted form in the possible\nintellect, it is wholly insulated from the diletto of the\nanima sensitiva (21–28). This has seemed to modern\ncommentators to imply an Averroist view of the intellect as a\nseparate, universal entity [Corti (1983), 3–37], and the lines\nwhich follow (30–56), where the vertú of the\nsensitive soul displaces reason and “assumes its\nfunction,” presenting to the will an object whose desirability\nthreatens a fatal disorientation, sustain this impression. Love is\nstill the aristocratic vocation of the troubadours, and Guido\nacknowledges that noble spirits are aroused by it to prove their\nmerit. But they work in darkness, for the force that moves them\nobscures the light of intellectual contemplation (57–68). The\ncanzone is so exclusively an exercise in “natural\nphilosophy,” so centered on biological necessity, that\nconsciousness itself is wholly excluded from consideration. The\nethical dimension of love consists in the challenge its blind urgency\npresents to reason. “Nobility” is a matter of\nself-control, and the precarious happiness that such love affords has\nno ideal dimension. \nGuido’s influence on Dante was profound. But the Vita\nnuova, an anthology of Dante’s early poetry interspersed\nwith a narrative combining commentary on his poetic development with\nthe history of his devotion to Beatrice during her earthly life,\nreveals a growing realization that his own conception of poetry and\nlove differ fundamentally from Guido’s [Ardizzone (2011);\nBarolini (1998), esp. pp. 60–63]. Like Guido, Dante accepted\nlove as being, for better or worse, fundamental to the noble life, and\nhis early lyrics express a sense like Guido’s of the internally\ndivisive power of desire. But as the Vita nuova unfolds there\nis a gradual shift of focus: having failed to win his lady’s\nfavor by dramatizing his own sufferings, Dante resolves to devote his\npoetry henceforth wholly to praise of her [VN, 18.9]. The result of\nthis new resolve is a canzone, “Donne\nch’avete intelletto d’amore” (“Ladies who\nhave intelligence of love”), which returns to the source of his\ninspiration and Guido’s in the poetry of Guinizelli, and makes a\nwholly new departure. For Guido, the “heavenly” allure of\nthe lady is a deception perpetrated by the senses, all the more\ndangerous as the lover’s gentilezza responds more fully\nto the attraction of her beauty and subjects itself to the\n“fierce accident” of passion. Dante, too, sees that the\nexperience his early, tormented lyrics depict is “an accident\noccurring in a substance” [VN 25.1–2], but the\n“fiery spirits of love” which strike the eyes of those on\nwhom his lady bestows her greeting are not just goads to desire\n(Donne ch’avete intelletto d’amore, VN\n19.10.37–40): \nE quando trova alcun che degno sia\n\ndi veder lei. quei prova sua vertute,\n\nché li avvien, ciò che li dona, in salute,\n\ne sì l’umilia ch’ogni offesa oblia.\n\nAncor l’ha Dio per maggior grazia dato\n\nche non pò mal finir chi l’ha parlato.\n \n[And when she finds someone worthy\n\nto behold her, he experiences her power,\n\nfor what she gives him turns into salvation,\n\nand so humbles him that he forgets every offense.\n\nGod has given her an even grater grace:\n\nthat one cannot end in evil who has spoken to her.] \nPursuit of the lady’s favor has become a test, not just of\nnobility, but of virtue. Her beauty is perfect, the fullest possible\nexampling of nature’s power to reveal God’s creative love.\nThe climax of the Vita nuova occurs when Dante encounters\nGuido’s lady, Giovanna, followed by his own Beatrice—“one\nmarvel,” as he says, “following the other” [VN\n24.8]. At once he realizes that Giovanna’s beauty, like the\nprophecy of the biblical Giovanni, is a precursor, heralding the\n“true light” of Beatrice, just as Guido’s poetry of\nearthly love is finally a foil to his own celebration of the\ntranscendent love revealed to him in Beatrice.  \nThe philosophical content of the Vita nuova is minimal, a\nskeletal version of contemporary faculty psychology and a few brief\nreferences to metaphysics. But while finding his orientation as a\npoet, Dante was also engaged in the study of philosophy and, according\nto his own testimony in the Convivio, “started going to\nwhere she [philosophy] was truly revealed, in the schools of the\nreligious orders and at the disputations of the philosophers”\n[Conv. 2.12.7]. Dante does not provide any additional details\nthat reveal specifically where he studied philosophy, but in\nFlorence in the early 1290s, there were three schools of religious\norders at which he may have studied: that of the Dominicans at Santa\nMaria Novella; that of the Franciscans at Santa Croce; and that of the\nAugustinians at Santo Spirito. Unfortunately, there are no reliable\nhistorical records concerning the course of study that may have been\navailable to Dante at Santo Spirito. However, there is reliable\ninformation about the resources that would have been available to a lay student at Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce. \nAlthough the Dominicans at Santa Maria Novella did not allow laymen to pursue studies of philosophy specifically, Dante would\nhave been permitted to attend theology classes, and in these there\nwould almost certainly have been at least indirect exposure to\nAristotelian philosophy [Santagata (2016), 83]. Most intriguingly,\nDante may have had the opportunity to attend lectures of Remigio dei\nGirolami (d. 1319), who had studied theology at the University of\nParis during the tenure of Thomas Aquinas there [Panella; Davis\n(1984), 198–223]. Remigio, like Dante, was a White Guelf, and,\nalso like Dante, Remigio read widely in classical literature and was\nfond of drawing lessons in political and ethical conduct from his\nreading. For both Remigio and Dante, moreover, Thomas was primarily\nthe author of the Summa contra Gentiles and the commentary on\nthe Ethics, concerned, like Aristotle himself, to demonstrate\nthe capacities of human reason as a means to truth. \nThe most prestigious studia\nin Florence in the 1290s, however, was surely Santa Croce, which, as a Studium\ngenerale, ranked only behind the three Studia\nprincipalia of Paris, Oxford, and Cambridge in terms of\nimportance [Santagata (2016), 83]. As Santagata notes in his recent\nbiography of Dante, \nTwo great intellectuals who were readers at Santa Croce between 1287\nand 1289—Pietro di Giovanni Olivi from Provence, and the younger\nUbertino da Casale—played a major role in the history of the\nFranciscan movement and, more generally, in the Church. Dante could\nnot have attended their lectures since both had left Florence before\n1290, but it is always possible that he had heard some of\nUbertino’s sermons. Dante never mentions Olivi, but in many\nrespects his vision of the history of the Church seems to coincide\nwith that of the Provencal theologian in its Franciscan and spiritual\ninterpretation. As for Ubertino, a leading champion of the Franciscan\n“spiritual” movement, namely of those who advocated a\nreturn to the rigor of Francis’s rule against the permissive\ninterpretation of the so-called “conventuals” led by the\nminister general, Matteo d’Acquasparta, Dante would have\nBonaventura da Bagnoregio say in Paradiso [12.124–126]\nthat they both betrayed the rule: Matteo because he “is too\nloose” through permissiveness, Ubertino because he “is too\nnarrow” through excessive rigor. [Santagata (2016), 84]  \nBeyond these possibilities in Florence, Dante’s testimony in\nConvivio 2.12.7 that he had attended the “disputations\nof the philosophers” may hint at some degree of exposure to the\nstudy of philosophy in Bologna in this period of his life.\nUnfortunately, there is a gap of a little more than two years in the\nrecord of Dante’s life between September 1291 and March 1294,\nand it is only possible to speculate on whether Dante was able to\navail himself of the possibilities of studying philosophical subjects\nthat would not have been accessible to him in the more constrained\nlandscape of the monastic libraries and studiae of\nFlorence. \nWherever it may have been that Dante acquired his familiarity with\nphilosophy and theology, his writings offer ample evidence of wide\nranging interests, if not deep expertise about each and every subject\nthat is touched on in them. In particular, Dante cites a dozen works\nof Aristotle, apparently at first hand, and displays a particularly\nintimate knowledge of the Ethics, largely derived, no doubt,\nfrom Thomas Aquinas. But his Aristotelianism was nourished by other\nsources as well. Bruno Nardi has argued persuasively that his attitude\ntoward the study of philosophy also owes a great deal to the more\neclectic Albert the Great [Nardi (1967); 63–72; (1992),\n28–29; Vasoli (1995b); Gilson (2004)]. In Albert, in particular,\nDante would have encountered a wide-ranging encyclopedism that\nincluded original work, experimental and theoretical, in natural\nscience, and treated Aristotelian natural philosophy and psychology in\nthe light of Islamic philosophers (notably Avicenna and Averroes) and\nGreco-Arab neo-Platonic sources such as the Liber de Causis,\nas well as the Christian neo-Platonist tradition of\nPseudo-Dionysius. Albert aimed to discover Aristotle’s own\nmeaning, with the help of Greek and Arab commentators who led him into\ndisagreement with other Latini, including at certain points\nhis pupil Thomas, and he asserts more than once that philosophy and\ntheology are separate spheres of knowledge. It was doubtless this\nwillingness to pursue philosophy on its own terms that appealed to\nDante, who also sought to distinguish philosophical and religious\nknowledge without simply subordinating the former to the latter. \nAlbert’s view of the procession of the universe from the\n“substantial light” of the divine intellect through the\noperation of a hierarchy of lesser intelligences is clearly\nperceptible in Dante’s treatment of the cosmic intelligenze\nor sostanze separate in the Convivio\n[Conv. 2.4–5; Nardi (1992), 47–62]. It shows\nup again in his treatment of the growth of the human embryo, which\nseems to imply, not a sequence of animations by nutritive, sensitive\nand intellective powers, as for Thomas, but the continuous operation\nof a single virtus formativa, whose operation Albert compares\nto that of the prima intelligentia in the soul [De\nintellectu & intelligibili 2.2], and which is responsible not\nonly for the development of the human creature but for effecting its\nunion with an essentially external anima intellectiva [Boyde\n(1981), 270–79; Nardi (1960), 9–68; (1967),\n67–70]. \nAlbert is thus a likely conduit for seemingly Averroist elements in\nDante’s thought. He regards intellectual activity as the\noperation of the intellectus agens, through which the human\nsoul is illumined by the divine Intelligence. Each soul possesses its\nown intellect, but this intellect is a “reflection”\n(resultatio) of the light of the primal mind, which thus, in\neffect, becomes itself the true agent intellect. Albert explicitly\nrejects the Averroist view of the active intellect as itself a\ncelestial intelligence, a single, separate substance which actualizes\nin the passive intellect phantasms supplied by individual human minds.\nBut he nevertheless also argues that only an intellect universal in\nnature can produce an understanding of universal forms. The intellect\nand the soul of which it is a function thus partake of the character\nof the separate intelligences. Soul is not the actualizing essence of\nthe human creature, as in Thomas, but is related to body through the\nmediation of its organic faculties. In itself, through its agent\nintellect, the soul is drawn to contemplate the intelligences which\norder the universe at large, is informed by them with the transcendent\nknowledge they manifest, and finally “stands” in the\ndivine intellect. In this way, certain men are enabled to fulfill the\ninnate human desire for understanding and attain a natural beatitude,\n“substantiated and formed in the divine being” [Albert,\nDe intellectu & intelligibili 2.2–12; Nardi (1960),\n145–50]. \nThat this fulfillment is attained through natural understanding, with\nno recourse to the theology of grace and revelation, marks a crucial\ndifference between Albert and Thomas, who devotes several chapters of\nthe Summa contra gentiles to a forceful refutation of the\nnotion that final happiness as defined by Aristotle is possible in\nthis life [SCG 3.37–48]. For Thomas the desire to know is one\nand the same at all levels, and philosophy, seeking the causes of\nthings, is ultimately “ordered entirely to the knowing of\nGod” [SCG 3.25.9] Dante’s own position on this question is\ndifficult to define precisely. The poet of the Paradiso is at\none with Thomas on the value of philosophy as consisting finally in\nits power to prepare the mind for faith [Par. 4.118–32;\n29.13–45], but he shares Albert’s fascination with natural\nunderstanding, and in earlier writings his willingness to grant\nphilosophy a “beatitude” of its own hints at a latent\ndualism in his thought [Foster (1965), 51–71; (1977),\n193–208; de Libera (1991), 333–36]. How far this reflects\nhis responsiveness to neo-Platonism as mediated by Albert or in such\nworks as the Liber de causis is hard to determine. Nardi, who\nargued successfully for seeing Dante as an eclectic thinker [Diomedi\n(2005), 1–23], stressed the importance of the Liber de\nCausis. But recent studies have argued that Nardi, in his zeal to\nfree Dante from the constraints of the orthodox Thomism that scholars\nlike Pierre Mandonnet and Giovanni Busnelli claimed to find in him,\nexaggerates the neo-Platonist strain in his thinking [Maierù\n(2004), 128–35; Stabile (2007), 359–70; Iannucci (1997);\nMoevs (2005), 17–35]. \nDante was surely also aware of a “radical” Aristotelianism\ncentered in Bologna, where masters influenced by Siger of Brabant and\nBoethius of Dacia were affirming the autonomy of human reason and its\ncapacity to attain happiness through its own powers [Corti (1981),\n9–31; Vanni Rovighi]. Many of these thinkers were following\npaths first taken by Albert, and it is possible that Albert’s\ninfluence, together with that of Thomas, is sufficient to account for\nthe most distinctive features of Dante’s use of philosophy\n[Imbach (1996b), 399–413]. However, a number of textual and\nbiographical clues have also been interpreted as pointing toward a\nmore heterodox dimension in Dante’s thinking. In short, the\nquestion of the influence of Latin Averroism on Dante’s\nphilosophical views has remained an active subject of debate among\nDante scholars [see esp., Fortin (2002); Ardizzone (2014 and 2016);\nZiolkowski (2014a); Stone (2006)] \nNotwithstanding Dante’s familiarity with various strains of\nAristotelian philosophy, there is also a distinctly idealistic,\nPlatonizing strain in his thinking that recalls not just the\nneo-Platonized Aristotle of the Liber de causis, but the more\nprimitive encyclopedism of twelfth-century thinkers like Bernardus\nSilvestris and Alan of Lille, poet-philosophers whose world view,\ninherited from late-antique neo-Platonism, was defined by the Liberal\nArts and the cosmology of Plato’s Timaeus [Vasoli\n(1995a, 2008); Garin  (1976), 64–70; Stabile (2007),\n173–93]. In Bernardus’ Cosmographia and\nAlan’s Anticlaudianus, the unfolding of the secrets of\nnature by the enquiring mind generates an allegory of intellectual\npilgrimage toward truth. Dante’s experience of philosophy,\nthough defined in more dynamic and sophisticated terms, is a version\nof the same journey. The experience of love becomes a means to\nself-realization, and an awareness of the hierarchy of forces\noperative in the universe at large, which makes possible an\nascensus mentis ad sapientiam, to that “amoroso uso\ndella sapienza” that enables the human mind to participate\nin the divine. \nThe fullest expository expression of Dante’s philosophical\nthought is the Convivio, in which commentary on a series of\nhis own canzoni is the occasion for the expression of a range\nof ideas on ethics, politics, and metaphysics, as well as for extended\ndiscussion of philosophy itself. Originally, Dante conceived of the\nwork as a “banquet” involving “fourteen\ncourses”—that is, fourteen treatises commenting on\ncanzoni on the “themes of love and virtue”\n(Conv. 1.1.14). However, the work, which was probably,\nwritten around 1304–1307, was abandoned with only four of its\ntreatises completed. In these surviving treatises, Dante describes the\ngenesis of his love of philosophy, and reflects on the ability of\nphilosophical understanding to mediate religious truth, tracing the\ndesire for knowledge from its origin as an inherent trait of human\nnature to the point at which the love of wisdom expresses itself\ndirectly as love of God. \nPhilosophy itself is the “love of wisdom,” and\nDante’s central metaphor for representing it is the poetic\ncelebration of a noble lady, a donna gentile, an act that,\nlike Guinizelli, he sees as involving the influence of cosmic powers.\nHis poetry, comes into being out of love and virtue [Conv.\n1.1.14] because his nature is responsive to the influence of the\n“movers” of the universe, the intelligences, whose loving\nunderstanding determines “the most noble form of heaven”\n[2.5.19] as they in turn respond to “the love of the Holy\nSpirit” [2.5.14]. Their cosmic activity is a continual\ntranslation of understanding into love and natural process, and it is\nthis which causes Dante to sing [Conv. 2, Canzone,\n1–9]: \nVoi che ’ntendendo il terzo ciel movete,\n\nudite il ragionar ch’è nel mio core,\n\nch’io nol so dire altrui, sì mi par novo.\n\nEl ciel che segue lo vostro valore,\n\ngentili creature che voi sete,\n\nmi tragge ne lo stato ov’io mi trovo.\n\nOnde ’l parlar de la vita ch’io provo,\n\npar che si drizzi degnamente a vui:\n\nperò vi priego che lo mi ’ntendiate. \n[All you who, knowing, make the Third Sphere move,\n\nhear what is in my heart, this strange discourse\n\nI can’t tell others for it feels so new.\n\nThe Sphere that follows on your virtue’s force—\n\nnoble, gracious creatures that you prove—\n\ndraws me in this state I have just come to;\n\nDo words about what I am going through\n\nseem not unworthily to you addressed:\n\nand this I pray you, that you hear my part.] \nThe intellective power or intendimento of the intelligences\nmoves Dante to an utterance which only these same powers can fully\nunderstand. Thus there is a continuum, a process of circulazione\nwhich begins in the mind of God and descends through the work of\nthe intelligenze to draw Dante’s nature into that\npraise of the donna gentile which constitutes the fulfillment\nof his own nature, the highest expression of which his desire and\nintellect are capable [2.6.5; Diomedi (1999)]. \nOf the four books or trattati of the Convivio, the\nfirst is largely a defense of Dante’s decision to write his\nprose commentaries, as well as the poems they expound, in the Tuscan\nvernacular rather than in Latin. The second book provides a\ndelineation of the Ptolemaic universe which the intelligenze\ngovern, capped by a description of the Empyrean Heaven\n[2.3.8–12]: \n…outside of all these spheres, Catholics posit the Empyrean\nheaven, that is to say, the heaven of flame or the luminous heaven;\nand they assert that it is motionless by having within itself, with\nrespect to each of its parts, all that its matter wants. This is the\nreason for the extremely rapid movement of the Prime Mover: through\nthe exceedingly fervent desire of each part of the ninth heaven (which\nis right next to that one) to be united with each part of that most\ndivine and tranquil heaven, it revolves within it with so much desire\nthat its speed is practically incomprehensible. And tranquil and\npeaceful is the place of that supreme Deity which alone completely\nsees itself. This is the place of the blessed spirits, according to\nthe Holy Church, which cannot tell lies; and Aristotle also seems to\nhold this view, to anyone who follows what he is saying, in the first\nbook of On Heaven and Earth. This heaven is the overarching\nedifice of the universe, in which all the universe is enclosed, and\noutside of which nothing exists; and it is not in any place but was\nformed alone in the First Mind, which the Greeks call Protonoe. This\nis the magnificence of which the Psalmist spoke, when he says to God:\n“Elevated above the heavens is your magnificence.” \nThe role of the Empyrean in thirteenth-century thought is equivocal.\nSome thinkers attempt to explain it scientifically, as a comprehensive\ncosmic principle, while for Thomas and Albert any such realm must be\nspiritual in nature and can bear no natural relation to the\nastronomical universe—though both at times seem to grant it a\ncertain influence on the natural order [Nardi (1967), 196–214;\nVasoli (1995a), 94–102]. Dante’s account reflects these\nuncertainties. He begins by citing “the Catholics,” or\northodox belief, as authority for his account of this “abode of\nthe supreme deity,” but then goes on to treat the Empyrean as a\ncreated thing, “formed in the Primal Mind,” and as the\nmotionless cause of motion in the physical universe. If God dwells in\nthis place, the Empyrean resides equally in Him, and the universe at\nlarge is encompassed, causally and locally, by the Empyrean. Dante\ndeploys the Aristotelian physics of desire to explain the relationship\nof the Empyrean to the lesser heavens, yet it is at the same time\nbeyond space, a wholly spiritual realm where blessed spirits\nparticipate in the divine mind. Dante seems to emphasize this double\nstatus by mingling theological and philosophical language, and\ninvoking Aristotle and the neo-Platonists side by side with the poet\nof the Psalms. In the Paradiso the problems raised here will\nbe implicitly resolved by a brilliant recourse to the\n“metaphysics of light;” when Dante and Beatrice, emerging\nfrom the “greatest body,” the crystalline sphere or Primum\nMobile, pass on “al ciel ch’è pura luce, / Luce\nintellettual piena d’amore” [Par.\n30.39–40], we know that we are at the precise point at which the\nbonum diffusivum sui that is God’s love transforms\nitself to cosmic energy, “the love that moves the sun and the\nother stars.” But poetry is perhaps the only means of defining\nthis threshold [Bonaventure, Sent. 2. d. 2, a. 2, q. 1, c. 4;\nThomas, Quodl. 6, q. 11, a. unicus 19]. \nSimilar ambiguities appear in Dante’s discussion of the\nintelligenze themselves. Since in governing the several\nheavens the intelligences engage in a kind of civil life, they must\nenjoy an active as well as a contemplative existence. But the latter\nis of a higher order than the former, and no single intelligence can\npartake of both. Influenced perhaps by Thomas’s commentary,\nDante imputes to Aristotle in the Ethics the view that such\ndivine beings must know only a contemplative life [2.4.13; cp.\nAristotle, NE 10.8, 1178b; Thomas, Exp. Eth. 10, lect. 12,\n2125]. Dante’s attempt to resolve the issue is oddly\nunpersuasive. He argues that the circular motion of the heavens, by\nwhich the world is governed, is really a function of the contemplative\nactivity of the intelligences [2.4.13]. Here, as in the case of the\nEmpyrean which they inhabit, we can see Aristotle’s celestial\nmovers undergoing a neo-Platonizing transformation, but Dante ends\nthis stage of his discussion by noting that the truth concerning the\nIntelligences cannot be fully grasped by our earthly understanding\n[2.4.16–17]. \nThe second book concludes with an extended allegory in which the\nconcentric “heavens” or planetary spheres are identified\nwith the seven Liberal Arts, the “starry sphere” with\nphysics and metaphysics, the Primum mobile with moral\nphilosophy, and the Empyrean beyond with theology. This synthesis of\nthe natural and the intellectual universe expresses an ideal of\neducation which harks back to the late-antique sources of\ntwelfth-century Platonism, but which Dante has imbued with new life.\nHis emphasis on the ordering function of moral wisdom, and on the\nhappiness attainable through intellectual contemplation, reflects an\nengagement with the philosophical tradition, and a commitment to\nphilosophy as such, which belong to the later thirteenth century. The\nfinal chapter of Book Two affirms the beauty that consists in seeing\nthe causes of those “wonders” that, as the opening of the\nMetaphysics declares, draw us to philosophy. \nThe third book is perhaps the most important for the student of\nDante’s knowledge and use of philosophy. Its central theme is\npraise of philosophy’s power, as “l’amoroso uso\ndella sapienza,” “the loving use of wisdom,” to\nimpart the highest happiness to those who love her, perfecting their\nnatures and drawing them close to God, of whose majesty and wisdom her\nbeauty is the expression. It is largely a meditation on love,\nunderstood as Dante’s response, intellectual, poetic, and\npsychological, to his enlightenment at the hands of the beautiful lady\nwhom he celebrates as Philosophy. \nEarly in the third book Dante cites the Liber de Causis:\nevery “substantial form” proceeds from the first cause,\nGod, and participates in His divine nature according to its nobility\n[3.2.4–8; LC 1.1]. The human soul, noblest of all created forms,\nloves all things to the degree that they manifest the divine goodness,\nbut desires above all to be united with God. Philosophy is the\nexpression of this desire in such a way that it, “apart from the\nsoul and considered in itself, has for its subject understanding and\nfor its form an almost divine love for what is understood”\n[3.11.13]. Thus it is through the love of philosophy—“the\nspiritual union of the soul with” [3.2.3] philosophy\nitself—that humanity perfects its “highest nature, in\nother words the truly human one—or better, the angelic or\nrational nature” [3.3.11]. For in this spiritual union, the soul\ndiscovers in itself “that fine and most precious part of the\nsoul, which is deity” [3.2.19] and “participates in the\ndivine nature in the manner of a sempiternal Intelligence”\n[3.2.14]. As such it mirrors the nobility, wisdom and love of the\ndivine essence and its “loving use of wisdom” becomes\nunified with God “through eternal marriage”\n[3.12.11–14]. \nAll of this may appear sheer fantasy, but we should remember that the\naim of philosophy as the Convivio pursues it is to attain,\nthrough natural reason, the greatest happiness of which we are capable\nin our earthly state. Such felicity is of course circumscribed by our\nmortality, and the Dante who celebrates philosophical understanding as\na quasi-mystical union with God also maintains that true union can be\ngranted only through grace to a soul made receptive by the infusion of\nthe theological virtues which wholly transcend the workings of\nrational, natural virtue. \nIn this vein, it is not surprising that Dante speaks of the soul after death as\nenduring “perpetually in a nature that is more than human”\n[2.8.6], and asserts that to perceive God is not possible for our\nnature [3.15.10]. Aristotle, too, had argued that a life of pure\ncontemplation is beyond our strictly human capacity—that we can\nlive in this way only to the extent that we have in us\n“something divine” [NE 10.7, 1177b]. But for Dante, as for\nThomas Aquinas, the modus essendi of the soul joined to the\nbody differs from that of the soul in separation: though they are the\nsame in nature, the separated soul understands, not by means of\nsensory images, but through species in which it participates by virtue\nof the divine light [cf. ST 1.89.1r]. In the temporal life, however,\nas Dante acknowledges, there are truths which we can apprehend only as\nif in a dream, “come sognando,” [Conv.\n2.12.4; Nardi (1944), 81–90], and our desire for perfect\nunderstanding is necessarily limited. To desire what is beyond the\ncapacity of our intellectual nature would be ethically and rationally\nincoherent, a desire for imperfection rather than perfection of\nunderstanding. Therefore, our love of wisdom is “proportioned in\nthis life to the knowledge which we can have here, and does not go\npast that point except by an error which is outside the intention of\nnature” [3.15.8–10]. \nBut the Convivio continually strains against these same\nlimits that it claims are appropriate to the proper scope of human\nknowledge in our temporal condition. For Dante, first and foremost a\npoet of love, the experience of acquiring philosophical understanding\nhas an important psychological component. By enabling us to analyze\nthe processes of perception, philosophy brings us into contact with\nthe true nature of things, and for Dante, as Kenelm Foster observes,\nthe slightest such contact could have a metaphysical value: \nIt did not in one sense matter to Dante what the particular object of\nhis knowing might be, since the joy of knowing it was already a\nforetaste of all conceivable knowledge and all joy; and this precisely\nbecause, in knowing, the mind seized truth…once intelligence,\nthe truth-faculty, had tasted truth as such, that is, its own\ncorrespondence with reality, it could not help desiring truth whole\nand entire, that is, its correspondence with all reality. [Foster\n(1965), 59–60] \nAt this point, knowledge and the joy of possessing it combine to\nprepare the ground for faith. By explaining phenomena which without\nher guidance would merely astonish us, philosophy inspires us to\nbelieve “that every miracle can be perceived by a superior\nintellect to have a reasonable cause” [3.14.14]: \nAnd here our good faith has its origin; from which comes hope, which\nis desire for what is foreseen; and through this arises the act of\ncharity. Through these three virtues one ascends to philosophize in\nthat celestial Athens, where the Stoics and Peripatetics and\nEpicureans, by the light of eternal truth, in a single will, concur in\ntotal concord one with the other. \nPhilosophy thus conceived can still be regarded as the handmaid of\ntheology, but as Dante develops his philosophical ideal metaphorically\nin terms of the beauty of the donna gentile, it assumes a\nreligious value of its own. Since the wisdom she embodies is the\nconsummation of human self-realization, the donna gentile\nresides in the divine mind as “the intentional exemplar of the\nhuman essence” [3.6.6]. In desiring her we desire our own\nperfection, for she is “as supremely perfect as human essence\ncan be” [3.6.8] When at this point Dante adds a reminder that\nnothing in our human experience can fully satisfy this desire, he\nseems to be acknowledging that what Thomas’ Ethics\ncommentary refers to as the ultimate end of desire’s\nnatural inclination is unattainable in this life, since it would\nrequire an understanding more complete than any human being can\npossess [Thomas, Exp. Eth. 1, lect. 9, 107; SCG 3.48.2]. \nBut having provided this caution, Dante seems to ignore it, as if\nunable to resist the conviction that philosophy satisfies our desire\nin a manner proper to itself. Everything naturally desires its own\nperfection, and for human beings this is “the perfection of\nreason” [3.15.3–4; cf. Thomas, Exp. Eth. 9, lect.\n9, 1872]. But philosophy, as embodied in the donna gentile,\nis not just the consummation of natural understanding. For Dante, as\nfor Aristotle, the human intellect as such is somehow more than human,\nand he is at times similarly unclear on the question of whether human\nbeings can attain happiness through the exercise of virtue, and to\nwhat extent it is a gift of the gods [Foster (1977), 198–201].\nRepeatedly he draws a distinction between merely human happiness and\nthat attainable through grace, only to seemingly disregard it in\nsubsequent discussion. Thus in the final chapter of the third treatise\nhe acknowledges the “strong misgivings” that one might\nhave about the happiness attainable through philosophy. Since certain\nthings—God, eternity, and primal matter are named—exceed\nthe capacity of our intellect, our natural desire to know must remain\nunfulfilled in this life [3.15.7]. Dante answers this by affirming, as\nnoted above, that the natural desire for perfection is always\nproportionate to our capacity to attain it; for to desire the\nunattainable would be to desire our imperfection [3.15.8–11].\nHuman happiness, then, consists in the attainment of Aristotle’s\n“human good,” through the exercise of the virtues. This is\nwhat Dante calls “l’umana operazione,” and\nits end is the highest that human beings can attain through their own\npowers. \nYet philosophy offers the promise of more. The same chapter is\nclimaxed by the vision of Wisdom as “the mother of all\nthings,” the origin of all motion and order in the created\nuniverse, guiding the quest of human wisdom by the light of the divine\nintellect. When the human mind is fully informed by philosophy, it\nwould appear, it becomes virtually one of the intelligenze,\nwho know both what is above them and what is below, God as cause and\nthe created universe as effect [3.6.4–6]. Thus Dante can speak\nof our rational nature as, simultaneously our “truly\nhuman” and “our angelic nature” [Moevs (2005),\n83–86]. \nThe Liber de causis says that each cause infuses into its\neffect the goodness it receives from its own cause, or, in the case of\nthe soul, from God [Conv. 3.6.11; LC 4.48]. When in gazing on\nthe body of the donna gentile we are perceiving the effect of\na cause which is ultimately God, and thus, Dante asserts\n[3.6.12–13]: \ninsofar as, with regard to her bodily aspect, marvelous things are\nseen in her… it is evident that her form, that is her soul,\nwhich directs it [her bodily aspect] as its proper cause, miraculously\nreceives the beloved goodness of God. And so it is demonstrated by\nthis appearance that, beyond the due of our nature (which is most\nperfect in her, as was stated above), this lady is favored by God and\nmade a noble thing. \nThus in effect the donna gentile is the perfection we desire.\nThrough her we experience the divine goodness, by an outflowing, a\ndiscorrimento, which Dante glosses with a further reference to\nthe Liber de Causis [3.7.2; LC 20.157] in terms of the\nhierarchical emanation of the divine goodness. In the quasi-continuous\nseries of gradations that descends from angel to brute animal, there\nis no intervening grade between man and angel, so that some human\nbeings are so noble as to be nothing less than angels [Aristotle, NE\n7.1, 1145a]. Such is the donna gentile; she receives divine\nvirtue just as the angels do [3.7.7]. She is a thing visibilmente\nmiraculosa, ordained from eternity by God in testimonio de la\nfede for us [3.7.16–17; Foster (1965), 56], and God, by\ninstilling his radiance in her love of philosophy,\n“assimilates” her form “to his likeness insofar as\nit is possible to be like Him” [3.14.3; cf. Thomas, SCG\n1.91]. \nPhilosophy has clearly become far more than the means whereby human\nnature achieves self-realization, though this ideal continues to\nprovide a framework for Dante’s praise of her. She has assumed\nthe status of Wisdom, sapientia, the divine mind as expressed\nin the order and harmony of creation. Like the separate substances and God Himself, her beauty can only be described in terms of its effects.\nThe true philosopher “loves every part of wisdom, and wisdom\nevery part of the philosopher, since she draws him to herself in full\nmeasure” [3.11.12]. Moreover, because the object of every\nphilosopher’s contemplation is the same angelic intelligence,\nphilosophical activity also unites individual human beings to\ndonna gentile in such a way that, as Ardizzone has put it,\nemphasizes a “principle of unity in which the cosmological order\nis the expression of a superior intellectual love and desire, one\nwhich human and superhuman beings may share” [Ardizzone (2016),\n274]. \nHere we may recall Dante’s account of how the swift motion of\nthe Primum Mobile expresses its desire for total participation in the\ndivinity of the Empyrean [2.3.8]. And it is in such terms that Dante\nends his account of philosophy-as-wisdom. In the final chapter of the\nthird treatise, she is explicitly identified with the all-creating\nWisdom of God as “the mother of all things and the origin of\nevery motion” [3.15.15], and Dante concludes in prophetic\nexhortation [3.15.17]: \nOh, worse than dead are you who flee her friendship! Open your eyes\nand look; for, before you were, she loved you, preparing and ordering\nthe process that created you; and once you were made, to show you the\nway she came to you in your likeness. \nThe fourth treatise of the Convivio seems to have been\nwritten later than the first three, and it is markedly different in\norientation. The principal theme of its canzone is the true\nnature of nobility. Introducing his prose discussion, Dante gives a\ncurious account of how an interruption in his philosophical studies,\ncaused by what the canzone calls “disdainful and\nharsh” behavior on the part of the donna gentile,\nprovided an occasion for taking up this topic: \nSo, since this lady of mine had slightly altered her sweet expressions\ntoward me, above all where I investigated and researched whether the\nprime matter of the elements was comprehended by God—because of\nwhich I refrained for a while from being the presence of her\nface—living more or less without her, I started to reflect on\nthe human defect related to the above-mentioned error [i.e., a false\nperception of the bases of human nobility]. [4.1.8] \nThat God is the creator of prime matter was an article of faith, and\nThomas had dealt decisively with the role of divine will and intellect\nin the creative act [SCG 2.20.7, 21–24]. That Dante should admit\nto having entertained doubts about such a question is perhaps a way\nhedging against or concealing the heterodox implications of his claims\nin book 3 [Ardizzone (2016)]. Alternatively, he may have sensed\nhimself idolizing the secondary powers in whose hierarchical\ncirculazione he felt himself, as poet, to be in a special\nsense participant, and allowing these preoccupations to cloud his\nawareness of God’s omnipotence. The anger of the donna\ngentile would then express his sense of a corresponding loss of\nfocus, a failure to affirm her unique and transcendent role in the\nexpression of the divine will. Or perhaps Dante had come to regard the\nmetaphysical exposition of books 2 and 3 as incidental to what he\nregarded as a more significant philosophical theme that emerges in\nbook 4. \nWhatever the precise nature of the dilemma to which Dante alludes, the\nfourth treatise is marked by a noticeable shift away from metaphysics\nin the direction of ethics and rhetoric. Philosophical knowledge is\nredirected to the purposes of social and political life, and the\ntreatise, while punctuated like the others by numerous digressions,\npursues a single sustained argument. Dante begins by explaining that\nsocial order is a necessary condition for human happiness and that it requires a\nsingle governor whose authority embraces that of all particular\ngovernors and directs their several efforts to a single end [4.4].\nAfter a long digression on the role of Rome in the providential design\nof human history, he turns from political to philosophical authority,\nciting Aristotle as in effect the governor of the mind, “master\nand guide of human reason insofar as it is occupied with its final\nend” [4.6.8]. From this, Dante derives the conclusion that even\nan emperor’s authority must be circumscribed insofar as the art\nof ruling and the laws it creates cannot overrule rational judgment\nbased on the laws of nature [4.9]. \nOn this basis Dante proceeds to refute the view that nobility consists\nin wealth and ancestry, a view which he here attributes to Frederick\nII, “the last emperor of the Romans,” and for which he\nwill elsewhere cite Aristotle’s Politics [Mon.\n2.3.4; Pol. 4.8, 1294a]. Perhaps as significant as the\narguments he musters to show the treacherous nature of riches and the\nuncertain course of nobility from one generation to another is the\nassertion of Dante’s own authority, as philosopher and citizen,\nthat is implied by his elaborate apology for speaking as he does\n[Ascoli (1989), 35–41]. The gesture nicely epitomizes the\nproject of the Convivio, a vernacular discourse which defines\nfor its lay audience the limits of political and scholastic authority\nand affirms the autonomy and potential dignity of individual human\nreason. \nThe later portions of the fourth treatise are grounded in another\nAristotelian definition of nobility, as the perfection of a thing\naccording to its nature [Conv. 4.16.7; Physics\n7.3, 246a]. The human expression of this perfection is virtue,\nmoral and intellectual. Electing to address the moral virtues, as more\naccessible to a lay understanding, Dante begins by describing how\nnobility is implanted in the nascent soul as the seed of virtue, from\nwhich spring the two branches of the active and the contemplative\nlife. The final chapters of the Convivio show how the virtues\nthat stem from nobility can direct the natural appetite of the mind,\nenabling it to evolve through love of them to the happiness which is\nthe end of virtue [Conv. 4.17.8–9; NE 1.13, 1102a]. \nIn the final stanza of the canzone analyzed in the fourth treatise,\nDante addresses the poem itself as “Contra-li-erranti\nmia,” his “Contra-the-mistaken,” and the final\nchapter of the commentary explains this as an allusion to the\nSumma contra gentiles of Thomas, written “to confound\nall those who deviate from our Faith” [Conv. 4.30.3].\nBy thus declaring himself the follower of so fine a craftsman, Dante\nsuggests, he hopes to “ennoble” his own undertaking. \nThe Contra gentiles may seem an odd choice of model. Bruno\nNardi considers that Dante had at most a superficial knowledge of this\nwork at the time when he wrote the Convivio, and it is\ncertainly the case that he is fundamentally at odds with Thomas over\nsuch specific matters as the origin of the soul, the role of the\ncelestial intelligences in creation, and, more important, in claiming\nfor philosophy the power to fulfil the human desire for knowledge in\nthis life [Nardi (1992), 28–29]. On all of these matters, Dante\nis closer to the position of Albert. \nIn any case, having dwelt at length on the insatiability of the base\ndesire for riches, Dante addresses the question of whether our desire\nfor knowledge, too, since it continues to grow as knowledge is\nacquired, is not similarly base. Dante begins his answer by asserting\nthat “the supreme desire of each thing, the primal one given by\nits nature, is to return to its principle” or cause, and he\nillustrates this proposition by the images of a traveller on an\nunfamiliar road, who imagines each house he encounters to be the inn\nhe seeks, and the desires of youth, which focus first on an apple or a\npet bird, then evolve to encompass love and prosperity [Conv.\n4.12.14–16]. But while this may seem to evoke Thomas’s\nview of a single desire which seeks to grow continuously toward union\nwith God, Dante’s point is that the path to fulfillment involves\nmultiple desires and the attainment of multiple perfections\n[Conv. 4.13.1–2]: \n…the desire for knowledge cannot be said to grow in\nthe proper sense, even if as was stated earlier it does expand\nin a certain way. This is because anything which grows in the\nproper sense is always one; the desire for knowledge is not always one\nbut is many—when one is completed, another comes along—so\nthat properly speaking, its expansion is not growth but a progression\nfrom something small to something large. For if I desire to know the\nprinciples of natural things, no sooner do I know them than this\ndesire is satisfied and fulfilled. And if I subsequently desire to\nknow the what and the how of each of these principles, this is\nanother, new desire, the occurrence of which does nothing to take away\nthe perfection to which the other desire led me; and this expansion is\nnot a cause of imperfection, but of greater perfection or\ncompleteness. \nThomas can speak of the natural desire to know as a force like\ngravity, whose attraction intensifies as it approaches its object [SCG\n3.25.13]. In contrast Dante’s insistence on types and stages of\nknowing may seem almost perverse, a matter of emphasizing the stages\nof the mind’s ascent rather than a single, unified desire that leads it forward from stage to stage. But what is at stake for Dante is the\nneed to acknowledge human ends as having a definite value of their\nown, and this need will play an equally important role in\nDante’s other major philosophical works. \nDuring the same period in which Dante was writing the Convivio\nhe was also composing the De vulgari eloquentia.\nComposed in Latin, this treatise was, like the Convivio,\nabandoned sometime around 1307. In it, however, many of the lengthy\ndiscussions of ethics and politics from book 4 of Convivio\nare put in the service of a discussion of the capacity of poets\npossessing both scientia et ingenium—that is, those who\npossess both knowledge and genius [DVE 2.1.8]—to use an\nillustrious vernacular language to “melt the hearts of human\nbeings, so as to make the unwilling willing and the willing\nunwilling” [1.17.4]. Underwriting this purpose, Dante offers a\nwholly unique treatment of the origins and development of language in\nbook 1 before proceeding in book 2 to set down specific rules that\nought to govern the proper poetic deployment of this illustrious\nvernacular. \nThere are nineteen chapter divisions to part one. Chapters 1–3\nlay the groundwork by discussing the basic purposes of human language.\nHere, Dante quite rightly recognizes that, even were we to regard\nintellectual content as immaterial, human beings are nevertheless\nconstituted in such a way as to derive intellectual content initially\nfrom sensation directly (as in the case of induction arriving at a\nfirst principle) or through the sensory communication of intellectual\ncontent from one human being to another (as in the case of dialectical\nor rhetorical engagement). Languages thus convey thinking but do so in\na material medium (e.g., sound produced by one person’s vocal cords and vibrating another person’s receiving organ of the ear).\nIndeed, for Dante, this use of language is at the very core of what it\nmeans to be human since, unlike other animals and also unlike angels\nand demons, “in order to communicate their mental conceptions\n(conceptiones) to one another, men had to have some kind of\nrational and sensory sign…rational because it would both arise\nfrom and lead to reason…[and sensory] since nothing can be\ntransferred from one reasoning mind to another except by sensory\nmeans.” [1.3.2]. \nChapters 4–10 then proceed to offer an investigation of the\norigins of the diversity of vernaculars in the world. The view Dante\noffers in these chapters focuses on both the creation of Adam and\nAdam’s first speech as well as on the story of the tower of\nBabel. (Aspects of the account offered here are later revised in the\nPilgrim’s discussion of this subject with Adam in Paradiso 26—see Aleksander [2016], 240–41). In chapters\n11–15, Dante describes his supposed hunt among the existing\nItalian vernaculars of his day for an illustrious version of Italian.\nBut rather than locating an illustrious vernacular among any of the\nexisting modes of Italian, he mainly heaps scorn on most of the\nregional vernaculars, including his own native Tuscan vernacular. For\ninstance, Dante writes that “the Tuscans, who, rendered\nsenseless by some aberration of their own” [1.13.1] merely\npersist in drunken raving [in hac ebrietate baccantur,\n1.13.2] about the excellence of their “foul jargon”\n[turpiloquio, 1.13.3]. \nThere is one important exception to Dante’s scorn for the\nfourteen or so vernaculars that he reviews, and it is the vernacular\nof the Bolognese. Dante claims that the Bolognese seem to “speak\na more beautiful language than most” [1.15.2] because their\nvernacular, unlike that of other regions of Italy, borrows from other\nvernaculars in such a way that it is “tempered by the\ncombination of opposites” [1.15.5]. Unfortunately for them,\nhowever, Dante explains that his praise for their language is not\nabsolute but is only relative to his disdain for the sad state of the\nother existing vernaculars. After all, he says, had the dialect of the\nBolognese been absolutely the best of the existing Italian\nvernaculars, why would praiseworthy poets such as Guido Guinizelli,\nGuido Ghislieri, Fabruzzo, and Onesto have abandoned it? \nIn 1.16, Dante turns from his hunt for an illustrious vernacular among\nexisting modes of Italian to his own definition of the mode of\nvernacular against which all other Italian vernaculars ought to be\njudged. Here Dante draws an implicit analogy between what is he is\nseeking in the case of the Italian vernaculars and the ways in which\nwe are able to identify through intellectual insight a law or\nprinciple that provides a determination of what is good or bad with\nrespect to some distinct capacity for action. Dante reasons that just\nas we are able to arrive at conceptions of “virtue” that\nought to govern our conduct, so too we ought be able to arrive at an\nunderstanding of the mode of language that is best suited to our\npractical needs as language users. As he will eventually make clear in 2.1–2, this mode of language would be appropriate only for\nthe best of uses by the best individuals. That is, this mode would\nonly be appropriate for use by those who are equipped by their own\nperfection to generate virtues in others.\nMoreover, this mode would only express and produce the virtues that\ncorrespond to the tripartite aspects of a human soul: prowess in arms,\nwhich pertains to the vegetal part of the soul’s determination\nto seek that which is useful; love, which pertains to a rectitude of\nthe appetitive or animal part of the soul; and rectitude of will,\nwhich pertains to the rational part of the soul [2.2]. \nFor Dante there are four main features of any mode of expression\nappropriate for these tasks. Dante identifies these four features as a\nvernacular’s illustriousness, cardinality, courtliness, and\ncuriality. That such a language can generate virtues in human\nbeings is precisely what Dante means in 1.17 when he calls such a\nlanguage “illustrious” since such a language is\n“sublime in both learning and power” [1.17.2]. And, in\n1.18, Dante explains that such a language is “cardinal,”\nor “pivotal,” (cardinalis) because it\n“plants” (plantat) what is best and peculiar to\nspecific local vernaculars and “removes”\n(exstirpat) what is disreputable [1.18.1]. It is\n“courtly” or “aulic” (aulicus)\nbecause “it is common to all and the property of none”\n[1.18.2]. And it is “curial” (curialis) because\nit has been weighed by the scales of justice in a court unified either\nunder the rule of a singular monarch or—as is the case for\nDante’s Italian contemporaries, who lack a unified court in this\nsense—according to a court unified by “the gracious light\nof reason” [1.18.5]. This last criterion thus suggests that such\na vernacular also depends upon and expresses the principles of just\nrule since, according to Dante, “the essence of being curial is\nno more than providing a balanced assessment of whatever has to be\ndealt with” [1.18.4]. \nDante’s style of argumentation in the De vulgari eloquentia\nis notably assertorial and seems to beg the question of the\ngrounds for his own authority to offer the principles summarized\nabove. To illustrate the significance of this style of argumentation,\nit is worth backing up for a moment to see that prior to defining the\nfour main features of any illustrious vernacular, Dante had already\nhunted for an illustrious vernacular among roughly fourteen existing\nregional species of the Italian mode of the vernacular. During the\ncourse of this hunt, however, Dante offered judgments regarding the\ndeficiencies of various aesthetic features of these existing modes of\nthe Italian vernacular as if he had already established the very\nprinciples that he articulated only after having abandoned that hunt.\nFor instance, after heaping scorn on the vernacular habits of his\nfellow Tuscans, Dante proceeds to the following evaluation of the\nGenoese: \nThe claim that an illustrious vernacular would not include frequent\nuses of the phoneme z is puzzling on the surface and seems to\ncall for a justification much more robust than the judgment that z\nis a harsh sound. Indeed, Dante seems somewhat aware of this\nproblem, for in 1.6.2–3 he had already staked out his own authority in undertaking his investigation by explaining that: \nTaken to an extreme, this comment suggests that the basis of his\nauthority to evaluate the quality of diverse vernaculars is his\n“exile.” Read in this way, Dante’s unjust exile from the\nimperfect community of Florence perhaps suggests a reversal of Adam’s\nexile from Eden (or of the hubris that resulted in Nimrod’s\nlinguistic isolation illustrated in Inferno 31)—an\ninterpretation that is also justified by the very fact that in this\nsame section Dante proceeds from this comment on his own suitability\nto judge Italian vernaculars immediately to a discussion of the\nforma locutionis of Adamic language. \nHowever, these claims also permit a more modest interpretation of Dante’s self-justification. In the first place, Dante’s claim to\nauthority by virtue of his exile from Florence suggests that the\nlegitimacy of an illustrious vernacular is not simply rooted in a game\nof numbers—that is, the illustriousness of a vernacular is not\nsimply a product of how many people use it in a given region of the\nworld. Quite to the contrary, since the proper use of such a\nvernacular requires that a poet possesses both scientia et\ningenium, those who are legitimate users of an illustrious\nvernacular are likely to be few in number, and the ways in which they\nought to employ such a language are similarly constrained. Moreover,\nboth Dante’s warnings about the problems of bias in our\nattitudes toward our own linguistic conventions as well as his point\nthat the legitimacy of his own evaluation is rooted in his attention\nto reason rather than merely to the senses provides a hint that Dante\nregards the legitimacy of poetic employments of an illustrious\nvernacular as grounded in philosophy’s authoritativeness with\nrespect to ethical and political matters. \nTo see how this hint bears out it will help to recall the points that\nDante offered in the Convivio about the relationship between\nphilosophical, theological, and secular political authority. As noted\nabove, in Convivio 4 Dante argues that even an\nemperor’s authority must be circumscribed insofar as\nthe art of ruling and the laws it creates cannot overrule rational\njudgment based on philosophical understanding of the laws of nature.\nBut, in fact, Dante pursues this line of thinking even further in\nConvivio 4.6.16–18 by explaining the practical\nnecessity of the unification of imperial and philosophical\nauthority. \nLater in the text, Dante is even more explicit about the priority of\nphilosophy’s authority to that of the emperor with respect to\njudgments concerning the political necessities dictated by human\nnature. In Convivio 4.9.14–16, for instance, Dante\noffers the following claim: \nIn other words, Dante’s argument in De vulgari eloquentia\nultimately depends upon and reinforces the claims of the\nConvivio that just rule requires the unification of\nphilosophical authority with that of the authority to establish and\nenforce laws. Philosophy qua philosophy is impotent in the task of\nguiding all but those who have already achieved both ethical and\nintellectual virtues. The emperor, on the other hand, can indeed\neither benefit or corrupt his subjects, but the emperor’s\nlegitimacy depends on his recognition of the priority of\nphilosophy’s claims to the knowledge of the principles of\njustice and the other human virtues since such matters are dictated\nmore by human nature than by local conventions. What the De\nvulgari eloquentia adds to Dante’s emerging\npolitical philosophyin the Convivio, however, is explicit attention to the significance of poetic\ndiscourse as a tool to be used on behalf of the project of unifying people under\nthe joint rule of philosophy and empire—a perspective that it is easy to imagine played a significant role in his choice to turn back to poetry as his primary vehicle for addressing his fellow Italians in their own vernacular in\nthe Divine Comedy. \nAlthough there remains some dispute about the date of the\nMonarchia’s composition (probably after 1314), it is\nclear that, unlike the Convivio and the De vulgari\neloquentia, the Monarchia was completed and disseminated\nin Dante’s own lifetime—though, evidently, it was not\nwidely circulated until the late 1320’s, when it came to be\ndeployed as propaganda supporting Louis IV’s claim to the\ntitle of Holy Roman Emperor [Cassell (2004), 33–49]. \nRegardless of the uses to which it was later put, the\nMonarchia is in its own way as idiosyncratic as the\nConvivio. Its purpose, foreshadowed in the discussion of\nempire in Convivio IV, is to demonstrate the necessity of a\nsingle ruling power, reverent toward but independent of the Church,\ncapable of ordering the will of collective humanity in peace and\nconcord. Under such a power the potential intellect of humanity can be\nfully actuated—the intellect, that is, of collective humanity,\nexistent throughout the world, acting as one. For just as a multitude\nof species must continually be generated to actualize the full\npotentiality of prime matter, so the full intellectual capacity of\nhumanity cannot be realized at one time nor in a single individual\n[Mon. 1.3.3–8]. Here Dante adds his own further\nparticularization of this Aristotelian doctrine [De Anima\n3.5, 430a10–15], asserting that no single household, community,\nor city can bring it to realization. The ordering of the collective\nhuman will to the goal of realizing its intellectual potential\nrequires universal peace [1.4], and this in turn requires a single\nordering power through whose authority humanity may achieve unity and\nso realize the intention and likeness of God [1.8].  \nThe basis of this argument for empire is evidently the first sentence\nof the Prologue to Thomas’ literal commentary on the\nMetaphysics, where he declares that when several things are\nordered to a single end, one of them must govern, “as the\nPhilosopher teaches in his Politics” [Thomas, Exp.\nMetaph., Proemium; Aristotle, Politics 1.5, 1254a–55a].\nFor Thomas this is only an analogy, a way of introducing the theme of\norder as it applies to the soul and its pursuit of happiness. The\npassage he cites from the Politics is concerned only with the\nrudiments of hierarchy; the idea of “ordering of things to one\nend” is present only by implication, and Aristotle makes no\nattempt to develop its metaphysical implications. Dante, however,\nseems clearly to associate with Aristotle, or with Thomas’\nreference to Aristotle, the idea of “a political organization\nwhich leads in its way to ‘beatitudo’ for the whole human\nrace” [Minio-Paluello, 74–77]. One may wonder if\nDante’s erroneous impression of the Aristotelian passage, which\nhe cites directly with no reference to Thomas in both the\nConvivio and the Monarchia [Conv. 4.4.5;\nMon. 1.5.2–3], is not a symptom of his intense need to\ndraw the Philosopher into support of his view of world empire. \nThe second of the Monarchia’s three books deals with\nthe great example of Rome, describing the city’s providential\nrole in world history, largely by way of citations from Roman\nliterature aimed at demonstrating the consistent dedication of Roman\npower to the public good, and the conformity of Roman\nimperium with the order of nature and the will of God.  \nThe third book deals with the crucial issue of the relationship\nbetween political and ecclesiastical authority. Dante argues on\nvarious grounds that power in the temporal realm is neither derived\nfrom nor dependent on spiritual authority, though it benefits from the\npower of the Papacy to bless its activity. These arguments consist\nlargely in refutations of traditional claims for the temporal\nauthority of the Papacy, but the final chapter makes the argument on\npositive grounds and in terms that recall the arguments first laid\ndown in the Convivio. Since man consists of soul and body,\nhis nature partakes of both the corruptible and the incorruptible.\nUniting two natures, his existence must necessarily be ordered to the\ngoals of both these natures [Mon. 3.16.7–9]: \nThis is Dante’s most explicit, uncompromising claim for the\nautonomy of reason, reinforced by the entire world-historical argument\nof the Monarchia and constituting its final justification for\nworld empire. Dante here goes well beyond Augustine’s sense of\nthe stabilizing function of empire, and eliminates any hint of the\nanti-Roman emphasis in Augustine’s separation of the earthly and\nheavenly cities. In the final sentences of the Monarchia the\ntemporal monarch becomes, like the aspiring intellect of the\nConvivio, the uniquely privileged beneficiary of a divine\nbounty which, “without any intermediary, descends into him from\nthe Fountainhead of universal authority” [Mon.\n3.16.15]. Like the Averroistic reasoning of his earlier claim that\nonly under a world empire can humanity realize its intellectual\ndestiny, this crowning claim shows Dante appropriating Aristotle to\nthe service of a unique and almost desperate vision of empire as a\nredemptive force.  \nFew texts have generated such deep and abiding interest as has the\nDivine Comedy in its nearly seven centuries of transmission.\nIn large part, this wealth of attention is a function of the way in\nwhich the Divine Comedy seems to gather, in what is often\ncalled an “encyclopedic” fashion, the entire edifice of\nmedieval knowledge (including but not limited to its reflections on\nethics, political theory, metaphysics, theology, biblical exegesis,\nliterary history, rhetoric, and aesthetics) and to call out to its\ncontemporary and future readers with the perennial demand that they\nmake its encyclopedic interests meaningful in their own lives. In part\nbecause of this seemingly encyclopedic character, but also because so\nmany of the poetic stratagems of the Divine Comedy involve\nirony and outright paradox, any attempt to summarize its philosophical\ncontent or significance is to a certain degree an act of folly. In\nfact all of the themes mentioned in the discussion of Dante’s\nthree expository treatises above constitute significant themes in\nDante’s magnum opus. Here, however, rather than attempt to\nsummarize the Divine Comedy’s treatment of these\nthemes, it may be more useful to offer a brief comment on what may be\nat stake in the question of the relationship between the philosophical\ncontent of the Divine Comedy and its poetic form. \nAt the outset, it is worth dispensing with the notion that the\nDivine Comedy rejects philosophy in favor of what appears to\nbe a mystical undertaking. It is, of course, quite true that the\nDivine Comedy condemns even Aristotle, the “master of\nthose who know,” to Hell [Inf. 4.131; all translations\nof the Divine Comedy in this entry are those of Robert\nDurling (1996–2011)]—specifically to the portion of Limbo\nin which souls of the noble pagans are punished only insofar as\n“without hope [they] live in desire” [Inf. 4.42].\nHowever, even if philosophical perfection is, in itself, insufficient\nfor salvation according to the Divine Comedy’s\nspiritual economy, this is not to say that salvation is possible\nwithout philosophy. In other words, the question of what philosophy\nmeans within the world described by the Divine Comedy\nprobably should not rest upon a superficial identification of it\nwith the fates of even those who are so easily taken to be its\nsymbols. \nIndeed, already in the Convivio, Dante presents a complicated\nunderstanding of the meaning and scope of philosophy. There, lady\nphilosophy was depicted in books 2 and 3 as offering human beings the\ncapacity for contemplative unity with God through their devotion to\nher. Hence, it is worth recalling a passage mentioned above in which\nDante maintains that \nIn this light, it is also worth noting that Dante turns toward the\nauthority of Aristotle in Convivio 4 only after having\n“refrained” from pursuing his desire for the donna\ngentile who embodies philosophy [4.1.8]. And it is noteworthy,\ntoo, that Dante appeals to Aristotle’s authority not about the\nspiritual and metaphysical matters that were the subjects of\ndiscussion in Convivio 2–3, but about those that\nconcern the definition of nobility and the role of philosophy in\nethical and political issues—issues that are pertinent only to\nthe question of the pursuit of temporal rather than spiritual goods.\nIn other words, the tension between the role of philosophy in the\nactive life and its potential role for the contemplative life is\nbroached in the Convivio in such a way that hints that the\nDivine Comedy, too, may be structured by the tension between\nits ambitions to make legitimate use of philosophy in these two\nrelated but fundamentally different manners—ways that may even\nbe in tension with each other insofar as pursuit of one end may\nsometimes seem to preclude or require the abandonment of pursuit of\nthe other. \nThere are, however, two major complications that hinder any direct\nassessment of the Divine Comedy’s treatment of the\nnature of philosophy. First, there is the question of the how to\ninterpret the explicit doctrinal claims of the various speakers in the\nDivine Comedy. Purgatorio 16, for instance,\nintroduces Marco the Lombard on the terrace of wrath. Marco’s\nspeech to Dante’s pilgrim touches on a variety of philosophical\nsubjects, including a refutation of astral determinism. But the\nculminating lines of his speech do little more than offer a brief\nsummary of the political philosophy espoused in Convivio 4\nand Monarchia. Specifically, Marco offers the following\ndiagnosis of the cause of civil strife in the Italy of Dante’s\nday (Purg., 16.106–12): \nSoleva Roma, che ’l buon mondo feo,\n\ndue soli aver, che l’una e l’altra strada\n\nfacean vedere, e del mondo e di Deo.\n\nL’un l’altro ha spento, ed è giunta la spade\n\ncol pasturale, e l’un con l’altro insieme\n\nper viva forza mal convien che vada\n\nperò che, giunti, l’un l’altro non teme.  \n[Rome, which made the good world,\n\nused to have two suns that made visible\n\nthe two paths, of the world and of God.\n\nOne sun has extinguished the other,\n\nand the sword is joined to the shepherd’s staff,\n\nand it is ill for those two to be violently forced together,\n\nfor, joined, neither fears the other.] \nAccordingly, read in light of the Convivio and the\nMonarchia, when Marco asserts in 16.91–96 that\neither a guide or reins are necessary to turn human appetite away from\nbase pleasures so that the human being may be genuinely happy, we may\nunderstand Dante to be endorsing the view that the best case scenario\nfor the cultivation of justice involves a unification of the political\nauthority of the emperor, whose laws operate as “reins” on\nhuman desire, with the authority of the intrinsic\n“guidance” that philosophy provides in its concerns with\nmatters of ethics. \nNevertheless, as straightforward as Marco’s speech seems to be\nat this juncture, the careful reader will keep in mind that the\nspeaker may be undergoing penance because his own sense of\ndevotion to justice fostered in him wrath towards others who did not\nshare his values—and in an unjust world, this would mean that\nMarco’s love of valor [16.47] would have made charity difficult\nfor him. In other words, even though it is true that Marco’s\nspeech recapitulates key arguments of Convivio 4 and\nMonarchia, the dramatic context for the speech introduces\nsome doubt as to whether we are meant to understand this speech as an\nunqualified endorsement for those positions. And, of course, this\nproblem—the interpretive problem posed by the significance of\nthe dramatic context for the various speeches in the Divine\nComedy—is an inescapable feature of the hermeneutic\nframework within which philosophical (and theological) doctrines are\noffered for our consideration. \nThe second basic complication that hinders any straightforward\nassessment of the Divine Comedy’s treatment of the\nnature of philosophy is that Dante’s choice to deploy Beatrice\nas the ultimate and explicit guarantor of the veracity and salvific\npotential of the text invokes and transforms the\nmeaning of his entire corpus of writings. That is, because Beatrice\nand donna gentile are simultaneously real women and yet also\nallegorical tropes as early as the Vita Nuova, the Divine\nComedy’s reinvention of Beatrice calls upon the reader to\nreturn to Dante’s earlier texts while also hindering any clear\nsense of what those texts have to offer in terms of their claims on\nthe reader’s interpretation of the Divine Comedy.\nMoreover, it must also be kept in mind that the Divine\nComedy’s pilgrim is a fictionalized depiction of the same\nperson who, relative to the setting of the Divine Comedy, had already written the Vita Nuova but had not yet begun writing the Convivio, the De vulgari eloquentia, and the Monarchia,\nand this also contributes to the strange relationship that the\nDivine Comedy constructs between itself and Dante’s\nprior writings. Indeed, a great deal of scholarly attention and debate\nhas centered around a handful of passages in the Divine Comedy\nthat may be considered palinodes to Vita Nuova and\nConvivio [see, for example, Freccero 1973; Hollander 1975,\n1990; Jacoff, 1980; Pertile 1993; Scott 1990, 1991, 1995; Ascoli 1995;\nDronke 1997; and Aleksander 2011a]. \nHowever, even if these two complications both hinder any\nstraightforward assessment of the the Divine Comedy’s\nunderstanding of the nature of philosophy, they permit a more modest\nconclusion about one of the fundamental features of the poem. That is,\nif it is safe to say that the dramatic context that unfolds in the\nrelationship between Beatrice and the pilgrim troubles our attempts to\nunderstand the Divine Comedy’s treatment of\nphilosophy, then it is nevertheless also safe to say that there is a\nphilosophical lesson to be derived from the way in which the\ntext troubles our attempts to understand it. In particular, even while\nthe Divine Comedy explicitly defends the superiority of a\ncontemplative path to salvation, nevertheless the poem also stimulates\nthe will of the reader by confronting her with the unsettling\nrealization that the doctrinal content defended in the poem’s\nexplicitly philosophical register is to a certain extent illusory in\nits veracity and therefore of questionable value to the attempt to\nfollow the intellectual path that is mapped out in that register.\nFortunately, this illusory nature of the doctrinal content may be\nirrelevant to the way in which the reader’s engagement with the\npoem actually generates meaning through a process that does, in any\ncase, always demand rigorous philosophical thinking. This is because\nthe poem is structured by the conviction that there can be no hope of\nachieving any of our possible perfections without constantly exposing\nourselves, especially in our shared activity of reading, to the\nanxious experience of wonder—an experience that is heightened\nand sustained by simultaneously striving for philosophical rigor and\nacknowledging it limitations.","contact.mail":"jraleksander@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
