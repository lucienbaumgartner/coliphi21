Yet as he put it: “There is no inquiry into the\nhistory of philosophy that is not at the same time a\nphilosophical inquiry” (PL, p. 41). While much of his\nphilosophical project involved an attempt to rethink pre-modern\nphilosophy, the impetus for this reconsideration and the philosophical\nproblems that vexed Strauss most were decidedly modern. Strauss\nespecially worried about the modern philosophical grounds for\npolitical and moral normativity as well as about the philosophical,\ntheological, and political consequences of what he took to be modern\nphilosophy’s overinflated claims for the self-sufficiency of\nreason.\n\nStrauss was born on September 20, 1899 in Kirchhain, a small, rural\ntown in Germany. He was raised in an orthodox Jewish home and also\nstudied at a Gymnasium in nearby Marburg where he received a broad\nhumanistic education. At the age of seventeen Strauss became a devoted\nadvocate of political Zionism. He spent a year in Belgium as an\ninterpreter for the military after which he began his studies at the\nUniversity of Marburg, where the neo-Kantian Jewish philosopher,\nHermann Cohen (1842–1918) had established a thriving school of\nneo-Kantianism. In 1921, Strauss completed his dissertation,\n“The problem of Knowledge in the Philosophical Doctrine of F.H.\nJacobi,” under the direction of Cohen’s student, Ernst\nCassirer (1874–1945). Strauss’s dissertation considered\nthe implications of Jacobi’s notion of revelation for the\nproblem of knowledge. Although Strauss would come to regard his\ndissertation as “a disgraceful performance,” the question\nof the meaning and status of divine revelation would continue to\noccupy him throughout his life. \nStrauss spent 1922 in Freiburg where he attended Edmund\nHusserl’s lectures on phenomenology. Like a number of others,\nwho would soon become famous philosophers in their own right, such as\nEmmanuel Levinas, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Karl Löwith, and Hannah\nArendt, Strauss was quickly taken with Husserl’s student, Martin\nHeidegger, who, he later wrote, impressed him as no other contemporary\nthinker had. The following year Strauss began lecturing in Frankfurt\nunder the auspices of a center for adult education, the Freies\nJüdische Lehrhaus, founded by Franz Rosenzweig\n(1886–1929). In 1925, Julius Guttmann (1880–1950) invited\nStrauss to Berlin to edit the jubilee edition of Moses\nMendelssohn’s work for the Academy of the Science of Judaism. In\n1930, Strauss published his first book, Spinoza’s Critique\nof Religion, dedicated to Rosenzweig’s memory, in which he\nargued that nineteenth and twentieth-century readers of Spinoza could\nsee him as a “God intoxicated man” only because they had\nceased to take the possibility of divine revelation seriously. \nIn 1932, Strauss wrote a review of Carl Schmitt’s recently\npublished book The Concept of the Political, in which he\nargued that, despite Schmitt’s attempts to do otherwise, Schmitt\nstill remained within the horizon of modern liberalism because he was\nunable to offer reasons for his normative commitment to what he called\n“the political.” Many of Strauss’s subsequent\ncritics have interpreted his claim that Schmitt remained a liberal as\nproof of what they consider Strauss’s anti-liberal ire. However,\nStrauss’s critique of Schmitt is perhaps better understood as\nevidence of what would be Strauss’s life long worry about modern\nliberalism’s ability to justify its normative commitment to\nliberal ideals in the face of moral skepticism, relativism and what\nStrauss also called “philistinism,” all of which say “in effect that\none does not have to think about the reasons why those things [of\nliberalism] are good” (WPP, 21). If the modern liberal state is\nimpartial to questions of value, how then does the liberal state\njustify its own value? Schmitt would state that no one had understood\nhim as Strauss had, and Strauss would later claim that reading Schmitt\nchanged his own orientation toward the question of the relation\nbetween philosophy and politics. \nIn 1932, due to the financial problems of the Academy for the Science\nof Judaism, Strauss found himself without a job. With a letter of\nrecommendation from Schmitt, he received a fellowship from the\nRockefeller Foundation to begin work, in France, on a study of Hobbes.\nIn Paris, Strauss attended seminars on Hegel led by Alexandre\nKoyré (1892–1964) and Alexandre Kojève\n(1902–1968). The next year, he received an extension on his\nRockefeller grant to work in London and Cambridge on his book on\nHobbes. \nStrauss’s work on Hobbes coincided with Hitler’s rise to\npower. Strauss thus turned his attention to Hobbes, whom he took to be\nthe founding theorist of the liberal state, just as the idea of the\nGerman liberal state seemed to be collapsing. Strauss’s third\nbook, The Political Philosophy of Hobbes: Its Basis and Its\nGenesis was published in 1936. Linking his newly found attention\nto the relation between philosophy and politics with his previous work\non what he regarded as Spinoza’s critique of religion, the book\nconcerns what Strauss claimed was the intimate tie between modern\nliberalism and its critique of religion. \nIn 1935 Strauss had published his second book, Philosophy and Law:\nContributions to the Understanding of Maimonides and his\nPredecessors. Here too the political realities within which he\nwas living overlapped with his scholarly pursuits. At the urging of\nGershom Scholem, Strauss turned three separate essays on Maimonides\ninto a book. Scholem and Strauss hoped that the publication of\nPhilosophy and Law would help Strauss to get a position in\nmedieval Jewish philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\nStrauss did not receive the position, which went instead to Julius\nGuttmann, Strauss’s supervisor at the Academy for the Science of\nJudaism and a primary target of critique in Philosophy and\nLaw. \nMuch of Philosophy and Law is an attack on Guttmann’s\nassumption that the central problem for medieval Jewish philosophy was\nepistemological in nature. According to Guttmann, the fundamental\nquestion in studying medieval Jewish philosophy was how medieval\nJewish philosophers, and Maimonides in particular, understood the\nrelation between reason and revelation as sources of knowledge.\nStrauss argued, in contrast, that Maimonides’ basic concern was\nnot epistemological but instead political. Before any questions about\nthe basis of knowledge can be asked, the question of what it means to\nphilosophize in the framework of the authority of the law must be\nanswered. Strauss argued that philosophy can clarify the meaning of\nthe law, but philosophy cannot derive the law itself. Instead, the law\nis the pre-philosophical context of and framework for philosophy. It\nwas also within the context of Philosophy and Law that\nStrauss began to consider something he had up until then thought\nimpossible: a return to pre-modern philosophy. \nIn 1937 Strauss accepted a visiting lectureship in history from\nColumbia University. The following year Strauss became a visiting\nresearcher at the New School for Social Research, home to many\nEuropean émigrés. Strauss’s position at the New\nSchool became permanent, and he remained there for ten years. \nThe decade that Strauss spent at the New School was arguably the most\nproductive, and certainly the most pivotal, of his intellectual\ncareer. In his first years at the New School, Strauss published the\nseminal essays that would become the book Persecution and the Art\nof Writing, published in 1952. In these essays, Strauss argued\nthat, when reading certain pre-modern thinkers, it is necessary to\nread between the lines. The possibility of persecution gives rise to a\ncertain type of writing that allows one set of the readers, the\nmajority, to receive one message while allowing a second set of\nreaders, the philosophical elite, to take away another message. While\nthis type of writing is often referred to as “esoteric,”\nit is more properly understood as “exoteric,” that is,\nwriting that outwardly veils a secret teaching of some sort. For\nStrauss, Maimonides, Judah Halevi, and Spinoza were all exoteric\nwriters. Despite the profound differences between them, Maimonides and\nSpinoza both outwardly teach that philosophy and revelation are\nreconcilable with one another. Yet, according to Strauss, the careful\nreader will notice that their respective arguments actually suggest\nthe opposite: that philosophy and revelation are in fact\nirreconcilable. Halevi, on the other hand, outwardly teaches that\nphilosophy and revelation are irreconcilable. But whereas\nHalevi’s dismissal of philosophy in the face of revelation seems\nto suggest that philosophy is not a challenge for revelation, Strauss\nargues that the careful reader will notice that Halevi’s\nargument in fact suggests the opposite: that philosophy is not just a\nchallenge for revelation but a supremely dangerous one. \nDuring his New School years, Strauss also delved more deeply into\nancient philosophy to explore the themes of persecution and writing.\nStrauss’s fourth book, On Tyranny: An Interpretation of\nXenophon’s “Hiero,” was published in 1948.\nWhereas the dominant reading of Plato’s Republic understands\nPlato to be advocating that philosophers should rule, Strauss argues\nthat Plato actually viewed such a situation as untenable since it\nwould require the consent of non-philosophers, the unwise. \nOn Tyranny concerns itself with what Strauss claims is the\nnecessary condition for the rule of the wise which is that\nonly the wise alone can secure justice for the city (OT,\n193).  In this study, Strauss offers a close reading of the\nrhetoric of Xenophon’s dialogue, which highlights, for Strauss,\nthe tension between the philosophical quest for truth and the\nrequirements of society. \nStrauss accepted a position at the University of Chicago in 1949,\nwhere he would teach until his retirement in 1967. Upon joining\nChicago’s faculty, Strauss gave a series of lectures on\n“Natural Right and History,” which would be published in\n1953 under the same title. Natural Right and History remains\nStrauss’s best-known American work but its basic worry is an\nextension of his early doubts about the ability of twentieth-century\nphilosophy to respond to the challenges of political and moral\nrelativism. In the United States, and in the department of political\nscience at Chicago, Strauss criticized what he took to be the moral\nrelativism upon which the social sciences rested. He begins the book\nwith an analysis of Max Weber, one of the principle founders of the\nacademic discipline of social science, and attempts to show a direct\nline leading from Weber’s positivism to historicism, which\nStrauss defines as the view that “all human thoughts or beliefs\nare historical” (NRH, p. 25). He then contrasts modern\nconceptions of natural right, beginning with Hobbes, with ancient\nconceptions, beginning with Plato. The former, argues Strauss, ends in\nhistoricist relativism, in which there are no moral, political, or\nscientific standards beyond particular historical contexts.\nNatural Right and History asks, though does not answer, the\nquestion of whether it is possible to return to some concept of nature\nfor understanding who we are as human beings and therefore to some\nnotion of absolute moral standards. \nStrauss published two other books and many essays in his later years.\nIn 1958 he published what is likely his most controversial study,\nThoughts on Machiavelli, in which he pronounced\nMachiavelli’s “anti-theological ire” the source of\nmodernity. After retiring from Chicago, Strauss taught at Claremont\nMen’s College in California for a year and then joined his old\nfriend Jacob Klein (1899–1978) at St. John’s College in\nAnnapolis as a scholar in residence. Strauss died in 1973. The\nArgument and Action of Plato’s “Laws” was\npublished posthumously in 1975. At the time of his death, Strauss had\nalso been at work on studies of Nietzsche, Thucydides, and Xenophon. A\nnumber of important collections of Strauss’s essays have since\nbeen edited and published by some of his former students. \nA number of controversies surround Strauss and his work. First, in\nrecent years, Strauss has been accused of being the intellectual\ngodfather of the neo-conservative political movement and thus of being\nthe intellectual force behind the Bush administration’s plan to\ninvade of Iraq. Second, no aspect of Strauss’s work is as hotly\ncontested as his claims about esotericism. Interpretations of\nStrauss’s view of esotericism include: that Strauss advocates\nclandestine cabals with secrets imparted from teacher to disciple;\nthat Strauss’s writings are themselves esoteric documents; that\nStrauss thinks that all thinkers write esoterically; that Strauss\nclaims to know a secret; that, Strauss promoted mass deception and\nperpetual war; and that, in one particularly crude rendering, Strauss\nused his esoteric methods to hide his fascist sympathies, if not his\nsecret Nazism. After exploring the broad themes and context of\nStrauss’s work, this article will return to reconsider these\nvarying claims about Strauss. \nStrauss’s claims about esotericism ought to be understood within\nthe broader trajectory of his life’s work. Such an approach is\nin fact in keeping with Strauss’s own recommendation for how to\nread philosophical texts, esoteric or otherwise. According to Strauss,\nan interpretation of a given text must begin “from an exact\nconsideration of the explicit statements of an author.” However,\n“The context in which a statement occurs…must be\nperfectly understood before an interpretation of the statement can\nreasonably claim to be adequate or even correct” (PAW, p. 130).\nTurning to the context of Strauss’s claims about esotericism\nhelps to unravel a number of other important themes in his work,\nincluding what he calls the “theologico-political predicament of\nmodernity,” the quarrel between the ancients and the moderns,\nand the relation between revelation and philosophy (what Strauss also\ncalls “Jerusalem and Athens”). \nIn his first published contention that Maimonides is an esoteric\nwriter, Strauss self-consciously examines what it means to write\nabout an esoteric text. Clearly referring to himself, Strauss\nwrites: \nStrauss maintains that before attempting to answer the question of\nwhether a secret teaching, only hinted at in the text, can be grasped\nwith confidence and precision, it is necessary to consider the moral\nimplications as well as the moral impetus of a writer willing to write\nabout such a secret. In making this claim, Strauss aligns his own\ndilemma with Maimonides’ dilemma and by so doing he points to\nthe basic motivation that directs his own claims about esotericism.\nThe question is thus twofold: why did Maimonides write the\nGuide in the first place and why does Strauss write about\nesoteric writing? In answering the first question, Strauss notes that\nthe literary form of the Guide is a letter to\nMaimonides’ gifted student Joseph, who, like many Jews of\nMaimonides’ time, was traveling in far and distant lands:\n“Joseph’s departure was a consequence of his being a Jew\nin the Diaspora. Not a private need but only an urgent necessity of\nnation-wide bearing can have driven Maimonides to transgress an\nexplicit prohibition [to write about esoteric matters]. Only the\nnecessity of saving the law can have caused him to break the\nlaw” (PAW, p. 49). \nIf this is Maimonides’ reason, what is Strauss’s? Strauss\nis willing to make the seemingly immoral and indecent move of\nrevealing the secrets of an esoteric text in order to save those\nsecrets. The secret that Strauss seeks to save is insight into the\npolitical, philosophical, and theological meaning of what he calls\n“a forgotten type of writing.” But why does Strauss care\nabout this forgotten type of writing? We can only answer this question\nby looking to Strauss’s published work as a whole and to the\nplace of Persecution and the Art of Writing within this whole\nand to do so it is necessary to understand Strauss’s most basic\nquestion, which concerns what he calls the “theologico-political\npredicament of modernity.” \nIn the 1965 preface to the English translation of Spinoza’s\nCritique of Religion, Strauss describes the beginnings of his\nintellectual journey by stating that “This study of\nSpinoza’s Theologico-Political Treatise was written\nduring the years 1925–28 in Germany. The author was a young Jew\nborn and raised in Germany who found himself in the grip of the\ntheologico-political predicament” (SCR, p. 1). Also in 1965\nStrauss’s The Political Philosophy of Hobbes was\npublished, with a new preface by the author, for the first time in\nGerman. There Strauss refers to the “theologico-political\nproblem,” deeming it “the theme of my\nstudies” (GS 3, p. 8). \nStrauss employs the term “theological-political\npredicament,” to diagnose what he contends are the devastating\nphilosophical, theological, and political consequences of the early\nmodern attempt to separate theology from politics. However, Strauss in\nno way favors a return to theocracy or, like his contemporary Carl\nSchmitt, a turn toward political theology. Instead, Strauss attempts\nto recover classical political philosophy not to return to the\npolitical structures of the past but to reconsider ways in which\npre-modern thinkers thought it necessary to grapple and live with the\ntensions, if not contradictions that, by definition, arise from human\nsociety. For Strauss, a recognition, and not a resolution, of the\ntensions and contradictions that define human society is the necessary\nstarting point for philosophically reconstructing a philosophy,\ntheology, and politics of moderation, all of which, he claims, the\ntwentieth-century desperately needs. \nIn describing the “theological-political predicament”\nStrauss continually returns to the questions of the epistemological\nand political status of revelation vis-à-vis philosophy. He\ncriticizes the modern critique of religion beginning in the\n17th century for advancing the idea that revelation and\nphilosophy should answer to the same scientific criteria, maintaining\nthat this notion brings meaningful talk of revelation to an end,\neither in the form of banishing revelation from conversation or in the\nform of so-called modern defenses of religion which only internalize\nthis banishment. Strauss’s early musings on the\ntheologico-political predicament led him to a theme upon which he\nwould insist again and again: the irreconcilability of revelation and\nphilosophy (or the irreconcilability of what he would call elsewhere\nJerusalem and Athens or the Bible and Greek philosophy). Strauss\nmaintains that because belief in revelation by definition does not\nclaim to be self-evident knowledge, philosophy can neither refute nor\nconfirm revelation: \nBecause a completed system is not possible, or at least not yet\npossible, modern philosophy, despite its self-understanding to the\ncontrary, has not refuted the possibility of revelation. \nOn Strauss’s reading, the Enlightenment’s so-called\ncritique of religion ultimately also brought with it, unbeknownst to\nits proponents, modern rationalism’s self-destruction. Strauss\ndoes not reject modern science, but he does object to the\nphilosophical conclusion that “scientific knowledge is the\nhighest form of knowledge” because this “implies a\ndepreciation of pre-scientific knowledge.” As he put it,\n“Science is the successful part of modern philosophy or science,\nand philosophy is the unsuccessful part—the rump” (JPCM,\np. 99). Strauss reads the history of modern philosophy as beginning\nwith the elevation of all knowledge to science, or theory, and as\nconcluding with the devaluation of all knowledge to history, or\npractice. In Strauss’s words: “the root of all modern\ndarkness from the seventeenth century on is the obscuring of the\ndifference between theory and praxis, an obscuring that first leads to\na reduction of praxis to theory (this is the meaning of so-called\n[modern] rationalism) and then, in retaliation, to the rejection of\ntheory in the name of praxis that is no longer intelligible as\npraxis” (FPP, p. 66). Whereas in the seventeenth-century,\nHobbes, like Spinoza after him, depreciates pre-scientific knowledge\nin the name of science, Heidegger, in the twentieth-century,\ndepreciates scientific knowledge in the name of historicity. While\nmany philosophers (including Heidegger) have understood\nHeidegger’s philosophy as breaking with modern rationalism,\nStrauss views Heidegger’s philosophy as a logical outcome of\nthat same rationalism. According to Strauss, modern rationalism\nimplodes upon itself: what starts as a modern quest for delineating\nscientific standards in the name of certain knowledge leads to the\nconclusion that there are neither such standards nor such truths. \nStrauss argues that just as modern philosophy begins with an\nover-inflated sense of reason that privileges theory over practice and\nends with a radical historicism that denies any meaning to reason\noutside of history, so too, modern political philosophy\nbegins with the attempt to make the human being part of nature as\ndefined by science and ends by denying any notion of nature all\ntogether. For Strauss, these trajectories come together in the\ncoincidence of Heidegger’s philosophy and his political\nmisadventures: \nStrauss does not mean to imply that National Socialism was inevitable.\nRather he means to investigate why there was no adequate rational,\nmoral response to the rise of National Socialism. It is here that\nthe modern crises of philosophy and theology meet in the modern crisis\nof politics. Neither modern political philosophy nor theology nor\nphilosophy had the critical resources to respond to the disintegration\nof the liberal state, the very political structure that was touted as\n“the opposite of… ‘the kingdom of darkness,’\ni.e., of medieval society” (SCR, p. 3). \nIt would become the mature Strauss’s task to consider how\nphilosophy, theology, and political philosophy could each once again\nhave the critical resources to make the most basic distinction between\nthe noble and the base. To do so, Strauss would have to overcome what\nhe called the “powerful prejudice, that a return to pre-modern\nphilosophy is impossible” (SCR, p. 31). \nWe are now in a position to reconsider Strauss’s claims about\nesotericism. In a 1936 essay on the political science of Maimonides\nand Farabi, Strauss returns to the meaning of prophecy for Maimonides.\nWhile most interpreters, including Strauss in Spinoza’s\nCritique of Religion and in parts but not all of Philosophy\nand Law, viewed Maimonides’ conception of prophecy in\nepistemological terms, Strauss argues that Maimonides’\ninnovation was to think of prophecy in political terms. According to\nStrauss, “Maimonides neither wished nor was able, nor had any\nneed, to lift the veil which conceals the origins of the Torah, the\nfoundation of the perfect nation” (RPSMF, pp. 15–16). Yet,\nStrauss maintains, the attentive reader will notice that Maimonides\ndistinguishes between Moses, the lawgiver, and all other prophets.\nMaimonides stresses Moses’ exalted status, argues Strauss,\nbecause for Maimonides Moses is the Platonic philosopher-legislator.\nThe emphasis on the uniqueness of Moses as the ideal prophet and ideal\nruler is the core of Maimonides’ political philosophy because\n“Not the mystery of its [the Torah’s] origin, the search\nfor which leads either to theosophy or ‘Epicureanism,’ but\nits end, the comprehension of which guarantees obedience to the Torah,\nis accessible to human reason” (RPSMF, p. 16). \nObedience to the law and the philosophical meaning of the law are two\ndifferent matters that are reflected in what Strauss argues is\nMaimonides’ dual conception of law. The exterior, literal\nmeaning of the law serves to sustain the political community in which\ncertain forms of behavior and belief are required, while the ideal\nmeaning of the law is a matter of philosophical speculation only for\nthose who are capable of such speculation. This dual conception of law\nparallels the dual character of Maimonides’ writing, which\noffers what Strauss calls a “moderate” reading meant for\nthe masses and what he calls a “radical” reading meant for\nthe philosophical reader. As Strauss would elaborate just two years\nlater in greater detail, this dialectical tension lies at the heart of\nMaimonides’ style of writing and argumentation. \nAccording to Strauss, Maimonides is able to properly balance the\nrelation between praxis, obedience to the law, and theory, the mystery\nof the law’s origins, not by conflating them but by keeping them\nin continual dialectical tension. For Strauss, Maimonides’\nrefusal to resolve the tension between law and philosophy (between\npraxis and theory) expresses Maimonides’ moderate claims both\nfor what philosophy can produce on its own (it cannot produce the law)\nand for what revelation can claim to know absolutely (it cannot\nprovide certain knowledge of the mystery of its origin).\nStrauss’s attention to esotericism is rooted in a philosophical\ninterest in “a golden mean which is neither a compromise nor a\nsynthesis, which is hence not based on the two opposed positions, but\nwhich suppresses them both, uproots them by a prior, more profound\nquestion, by raising a fundamental problem, the work of a truly\ncritical philosophy” (RPSMF, p. 4). \nFor Strauss, the work of a truly critical philosophy is to grasp\nproblems, and not to provide solutions. What is the absolute problem\nat the heart of esotericism, according to Strauss? The problem\nconcerns the self-sufficiency of reason or, put another way, the\ninescapable and necessary tension between theory and practice. The\ntheological-political predicament of modernity stems from the modern\ncommitment to the self-sufficiency of reason that, Strauss argues,\nresults in reason’s self-destruction. Esotericism is a means\ntoward preserving the limits of philosophy and revelation (or law)\nvis-à-vis one another. The law comes up against its own\nlimitations in the quest to articulate the philosophical foundations\nof the law. But at the same time, philosophy comes up against its own\nlimits in recognizing that the philosopher is always already within\nsociety (or the law) and for this reason dependent upon the law.\nStrauss thus makes the seemingly immoral move of revealing\nMaimonides’ art of writing for the sake of saving the\npossibility of both revelation and philosophy. \nAnother recurrent theme in Strauss’s work is what he calls\n“the quarrel between the ancients and the moderns.” Most\nspecifically, the quarrel between the ancients and the moderns for\nStrauss is about the excesses of modern claims for the authoritative\nclaims of reason and the philosophical moderation of the ancients. As\nwe saw above, according to Strauss, the trajectory of modern\nphilosophy’s demise begins with the belief that modern\nphilosophy has refuted revelation once and for all. This false belief\nis based on an overreaching view of what philosophical reason alone\ncan accomplish and it leads to the equally false belief that there are\nno rational standards because reason is always imbedded within and\ndetermined by history. Strauss contrasts Socrates’ moderation\nwith the excess of modern philosophers. Socrates’ moderation is\nnot merely a political concession, according to Strauss, but bears\nupon the question of how we come to truth: “Socrates implied\nthat disregarding the opinions about the nature of things would amount\nto abandoning the most important access to reality which we have, or\nthe most important vestiges of truth which are within our reach”\n(NRH, p. 124). But even though truth is within our reach, philosophy\nbegins and ends with the quest for truth: “philosophy\nis meant—and that is the decisive point—not as a set of\npropositions, a teaching, or even a system, but as a way of life, a\nlife animated by a peculiar passion, the philosophic desire, or\neros; it is not understood as an instrument or a department\nof human self-realization” (NRH, p. 122). As a way of life,\n“the problems are always more evident than the solutions. All\nsolutions are questionable… Therefore, the right way of life\ncannot be established metaphysically except by a completed\nmetaphysics, and therefore the right way of life remains\nquestionable” (NRH, pp. 122–123). \nThat the right way of life remains questionable and hence the claim\nfor philosophy’s modesty regarding its own capabilities brings\nus back to philosophy’s relation to revelation. Without a\ncompleted metaphysics, philosophy cannot refute revelation. This\ninability to refute revelation has serious consequences for\nphilosophy’s self-understanding. As Strauss puts it in\nNatural Right and History, in what is probably his most well\nknown statement on the topic: \nHere we see that, for Strauss, the tension between revelation and\nphilosophy is not one between irrationality and rationality but\nbetween fundamentally irreconcilable criteria for what constitutes the\nrational starting point of truth. Philosophy begins and ends\nfor Strauss with the philosopher’s sense of wonder, while\nrevealed religion begins and ends with adherence to the divine law.\nYet as Strauss suggests, this situation puts philosophy at a\ndisadvantage and revelation at an advantage. Never claiming to rest on\nevident knowledge, revelation can rationally approach its truth\nclaims, not to prove them but to understand them. But philosophy,\nwhich values reason first and foremost, is led to the unpleasant truth\nthat it is in fact predicated on something that is and remains\nunevident: that the human question for knowledge is the right\nlife. \nStrauss’s simultaneous criticism of the self-sufficiency of\nreason and defense of the rational plausibility (though not the\ncertainty) of revelation bears an important affinity to arguments of\ncontemporary Christian philosophers of religion, such as Alvin\nPlantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff, who point out that philosophers\nand others take many things for granted for which we do not have\ncertain evidence, such as sense perception, memory, or the inner lives\nof other people. Like Strauss, these philosophers of religion\ncriticize the hubris of Enlightenment attempts to define knowledge\nonly in terms of scientific evidence. Once we dispense with modern\nphilosophy’s overreaching claims for reason, the fact that\nrevelation cannot be proven definitively does not rule out the\npossibility of making rational arguments about God’s revelation.\nSuch arguments become impossible only when absolute proof for\nGod’s existence is the prerequisite for reasoning about\nrevelation. \nHowever, unlike Plantinga and Wolterstorff, Strauss’s project is\nnot to make rational arguments for God’s revelation but only to\nsuggest that such arguments are in theory possible. Because Strauss\nclearly is not interested in offering a constructive theology, some\ninterpreters have concluded that, despite appearances to the contrary,\nhe did not really take the possibility of revelation seriously.\nPerhaps most notably, the eminent Strauss scholar, Heinrich Meier,\nmaintains that Strauss purposely overstates the problem posed by\nrevelation for philosophy in order to inspire philosophical readers in\ntheir quest for the philosophical life. Meier further understands the\ntheologico-political problem in terms of what he claims is\nStrauss’s life-long effort to create a philosophical school.\nMeier’s basic contention is that the quarrel between revelation\nand philosophy as Strauss describes it leaves the careful reader many\nopportunities to consider whether revelation really does constitute\nthe refutation of philosophy and to realize that philosophy does in\nfact have philosophical and moral resources from which to respond to\nrevelation. \nIt is true that some of Strauss’s sketches of revelation do not\nmake revelation compelling from a philosophical point of view. If the\nquestion about the relation between revelation and philosophy pertains\nto a decision for faith or philosophy, Strauss’s conception of\nrevelation sounds very much like Kierkegaard’s conception\naccording to which a leap of faith defines revelation. This\ntheological vantage point is similar to Strauss’s description of\nFranz Rosenzweig and Karl Barth’s reawakening of theology. Yet\nStrauss explicitly rejects this sort of theological decisionism\nbecause, he argues, this position amounts to a “farewell to\nreason.” By mistakenly assuming that Strauss defines revelation\nas blind faith, many of Strauss’s interpreters have concluded\nthat he does not in the end take revelation seriously from a\nphilosophical point of view. In support of this position, Meier in\nfact quotes Julius Guttmann’s critical response to Strauss,\nwhich is that Strauss shows an “indifference towards the content\nof revelation… Whether Jewish or Christian revelation is of\nconcern makes no difference whatsoever” (as quoted in Meier\n2006, p. 20). For Guttmann, this supposed indifference to\nrevelation’s content means that Strauss gets medieval Jewish\nrationalism wrong. For Meier, this supposed indifference means that\ndespite what seems to be Strauss’s defense of revelation’s\ncapacity to criticize philosophy, revelation is in the end for Strauss\na straw man. As Meier puts it, “What appears to the believer to\nbe ‘indifference’ proves on closer inspection to be a\nconscious dissociation and ultimately a rejection” (Meier 2006,\np. 20, note 25).  \nYet Strauss was not indifferent to the content of revelation and\ncertainly not to the difference between Jewish and Christian notions\nof revelation. In fact, Strauss strongly criticizes what he regards as\na particularly Christian view of revelation not in order to banish\nrevelation from intellectual conversation once and for all but to\nsuggest that modernity’s intellectual ills stem in large part\nfrom the legacy of Christian theology. In a 1952 letter to Gershom\nScholem, Strauss rejects his early reading of Maimonides in\nPhilosophy and Law as the “Jewish equivalence of Thomas\nAquinas.”  Describing the development of his views on Maimonides,\nStrauss writes to Scholem that he has “moved, so to speak, contrary to\nG.’s [Guttmann’s] moderate rationalism…to\n‘radical’ rationalism” (GS 3, 728).  Strikingly, it was on\nthe basis of the Islamic, as opposed to the Christian, reception of\nclassical political philosophy that Strauss turned to the possiblity\nof “radical rationalism” by reconsidering the meanings of philosophy,\nrevelation, and politics.  Strauss’s very attempt to move beyond\nmodern philosophy is predicated on a distinction between the Jewish\nand Islamic conception of revelation on the one hand, and the\nChristian conception, on the other hand: \nStrauss problematizes the Christian view of revelation as doctrinal\nknowledge that must be believed. From his early to his mature\nwritings, Strauss contends that the making of revelation into\nknowledge in scholastic theology ultimately led to modern\nphilosophy’s far too over-reaching claims. As Strauss puts it\nrather succinctly, “On the querelle des anciens et des\nmodernes: I do not deny, but assert, that modern philosophy has\nmuch that is essential in common with Christian medieval philosophy;\nbut that means that the attack of the moderns is directed\ndecisively against ancient philosophy” (CCM, p. 106).\nOr, as he puts it elsewhere, “modern philosophy emerged by way\nof transformation of, if in opposition to, Latin or Christian\nscholasticism” (JPCM, p. 252). \nStrauss’s distinction between Judaism and Islam, on the one\nhand, and Christianity, on the other, is decisive for understanding\nhis conception of the relation between Jerusalem and Athens as well as\nfor appreciating his conception of the theologico-political problem,\nas a diagnosis of modernity’s philosophical, theological, and\npolitical ills. On an epistemological level, philosophy may well have\ngood arguments to make in response to revelation. Strauss explicitly\ncriticizes what he regards as Rosenzweig’s and Karl\nBarth’s decisionist conception of revelation, i.e. revelation as\na leap of faith, which, he maintains, holds no promise of rationalism.\nFrom an epistemological point of view, philosophy understood as a way\nof life, concerned with problems and unconvinced of promises of\nabsolute solutions, will appear more rational to potential\nphilosophers. \nYet for Strauss the serious argument with which revelation challenges\nphilosophy is not epistemological but moral. This is not to deny the\nimportance of the pursuit of truth for Strauss, but it is to return to\nhis criticism of the modern depreciation of pre-scientific or\npre-philosophical knowledge. Again, Strauss is a critic of the\nEnlightenment’s view of the self-sufficiency of reason. If\nphilosophy is to have critical potential, argues Strauss, philosophy\nmust be skeptical even of itself. This means that philosophers should\nnot only tolerate religion for their own instrumental purposes but\nthat philosophy is challenged by revelation, understood as law and not\nas knowledge, on moral grounds. \nStrauss argues, both in his early work on medieval Jewish rationalism\nand in his mature American work, that only revelation, and not\nphilosophy, can provide the basis of a universal morality. To be sure,\nthis universal morality is based on faith and not certain knowledge.\nNevertheless, it does underscore a moral weakness in the philosophical\nposition. Nowhere does Strauss highlight this point more than in his\nseminal 1943 essay on the medieval Jewish thinker Judah Halevi. This\nessay became an integral part of Persecution and the Art of\nWriting and far from an obscure relic of an interest in things\nJewish and medieval, Strauss’s reference to this essay forms a\ndecisive part of his argument in Natural Right and\nHistory. \nStrauss’s reading of Halevi centers on the question of what\nHalevi, in his Kuzari, could have meant by the “law of\nreason.” Through a detailed analysis of the Halevi’s\nKuzari, Strauss concludes, “the iura naturalia\nare really not more than the indispensable and unchangeable minimum of\nmorality required for the bare existence of any society.” But as\nStrauss points out, the unchangeable minimum of morality is in fact,\nfrom a moral point of view, not very much after all. In explicating\nHalevi’s position, Strauss elaborates on Halevi’s comment\nin the Kuzari that “Even a gang of robbers must have a\nkind of justice among them if their confederacy is to last,”\n(the analogy refers to, without mentioning, Plato’s parable of\nthe robbers in Republic, Book 1, 342b-d). Strauss writes: \nStrauss concludes his study of Halevi by suggesting that “by\ngoing so far with the philosophers…he [Halevi] discover[s] the\nfundamental weakness of the philosophic position and the deepest\nreason why philosophy is enormously dangerous” (PAW, p. 140). On\nStrauss’s reading of Halevi, philosophy leads to the dangerous\ndenial of an absolute morality that is not contingent upon allegiance\nto a specific group. \nIn Natural Right and History Strauss does not deny that we\ncan know right and wrong, but he does question strongly whether\nphilosophy in and of itself can defend a universal morality beyond\nthat of a closed city or society. Significantly, Strauss alludes to\nHalevi’s analogy of a gang of robbers when he writes: \nStrauss’s allusion to Halevi is made all the stronger by a\nreference to his essay on Halevi in a note to the following sentence:\n“There exists an alternative medieval interpretation of\nAristotle’s doctrine [of natural right], namely, the Averroistic\nview or, more adequately stated, the view characteristic of the\nfalāsia, as well as of the Jewish Aristotelians” (NRH, p.\n158). The context of this comment and note is Strauss’s\ndistinction between the Aristotelian view of natural right and the\nSocratic-Platonic view. For Aristotle, Strauss writes, “there is\nno fundamental disproportion between natural right and the\nrequirements of political society” (NRH, p. 156). In contrast,\nStrauss maintains, the Platonic-Socratic view of natural right\nrecognizes a fundamental discrepancy between the justice of natural\nright, which is independent of law, and the justice of the city, which\nis of necessity dependent on law. The Platonic-Socratic view of\nnatural right points to the philosopher’s lack of inner\nattachment to the laws of society. \nFor Strauss, the “Averroistic view” that is “an\nalternative medieval interpretation of Aristotle’s\ndoctrine” is based on the Islamic reception of Plato’s\nLaws and hence is Platonic in a way that the Christian\nreading of Aristotle is not. Plato and the “Jewish\nAristotelians,” Strauss insists, recognize a fundamental tension\nbetween philosophy and law, which is also the tension between\nphilosophy and “the city.” As Strauss makes clear in\nNatural Right and History, it is the Christian interpretation\nof Aristotle, and particularly Thomas Aquinas’ notion of natural\nlaw, that denies this tension: “The Thomistic doctrine of\nnatural right or, more generally expressed, of natural law is free\nfrom the hesitations and ambiguities which are characteristic of the\nteachings, not only of Plato and Cicero, but of Aristotle as\nwell…. No doubt is left…” (NRH, p. 163). We have\nseen that for Strauss, leaving doubt behind is the intellectual error\nthat led to the theologico-political predicament of the early\ntwentieth-century, with ultimately terrible consequences for reason,\nmorality, and politics. \nBy repeatedly emphasizing his doubts about philosophy’s ability\nto ground a universal morality, Strauss suggests that revelation\nremains and must remain a continual moral challenge for philosophy\n(see also JPCM; NRH, pp. 106–107; PAW, p. 140). To be sure,\nStrauss’s is not an argument for revelation. And\nStrauss himself was not a believer. But Strauss’s arguments\nabout revelation do offer the believer intellectual resources with\nwhich to challenge the philosopher and for this reason Strauss is\nneither indifferent to nor does he reject revelation. As Strauss\nconcludes his essay on Halevi, “One has not to be naturally\npious, he has merely to have a passionate interest in genuine morality\nin order to long with all his heart for revelation: moral man as such\nis the potential believer” (PAW, p. 140, emphasis added). \nOf course, revelation’s challenge to philosophy is but a\nchallenge and never a victory. At the same time, philosophy always\nremains a challenge to revelation’s ability to make claims about\nconclusive evidence for revelation’s truth. This mutual\nchallenge is ultimately a form of moderation.  \nWhile many scholars still see Strauss as clearly siding with Athens\n(Meier 2006; Velkley 2011; Lampert 2013), recent scholarship has\ncontinued to debate which side of the divide Strauss finds most\nconvincing.  Some argue that Strauss uncovers “Plato as the\nfundamental philosophical ally of the standpoint of Jerusalem, which\nrejects the project of a philosophical or scientific foundation of\nethics in favor of its foundsion in divine revelation as law” (Vatter,\np. 206).  Others contend that Strauss’s “engagement with\nJersualem is itself an aspect of philosophy as a contemplative way of\nlife” (Bernstein, p. xxii).   And still others maintain that\nStrauss shared with Maimonides “The struggle to bring about a grerater\namount of harmony through a fertile tension [between philosophy and\nthe life of Torah], in individual human beings and thus in collective\nhuman affairs” (Green 2013, p. 87).  \nLet us return to the controversies surrounding Strauss and his work,\nmentioned above. The claim that Strauss is in some way responsible for\nthe Bush administration’s decision to invade Iraq has little\nmerit. As should be clear from the above, Strauss’s work does\nnot concern policy issues of any sort. If others have adapted his\nphilosophical ideas in the pursuit of policy questions, they\nthemselves are responsible for those policy decisions, not Strauss.\nMorever, few, if any, real arguments have been advanced that conclude\nBush administration policy makers who studied with Strauss’s\nstudents ever consciously applied his ideas when making decisions\nconcerning the war in Iraq. In the context of such claims about\nStrauss’s influence on the Bush administration’s policies\non Iraq and the Middle East more generally, there is an irony, namely,\nthat Strauss himself was devoted to revitalizing Islamic philosophy,\nas opposed to Christian thought, for the very sake of the future of\nwestern civilization. \nAppreciating the centrality of Strauss’s concern with the\ntheologico-political predicament allows us also to reconsider claims\nabout his purported sympathy for fascism. In recent years, much has\nbeen made of a letter that the young Strauss wrote to his friend Karl\nLöwith in 1933. Writing from Paris and reflecting on\nHitler’s rise to power, Strauss wrote that it was only possible\nto “protest against the shabby abomination” of Nazi\nGermany “from the principles of the right, that is from fascist,\nauthoritarian, and imperial principles” (GS 3, pp.\n624–625). A number of Strauss’s severest critics refer to\nthis letter as evidence of Strauss’s fascism, if not Nazism.\nYet, as Robert Howse has concisely pointed out, “It requires\nonly a little care, and remembering the context of the letter, to\nunderstand that Strauss is not here affirming as true ‘the\nprinciples of the right’ but rather he is suggesting that they\nare the only effective basis on which Hitler (’the shabby\nabomination’) could be opposed in the present\ncircumstances” (Howse 2012). Rather than an expression of\nsympathy for the fascist, imperial right of Hitler’s Germany,\nStrauss’s letter to Löwith is further evidence of his life\nlong moral worry about liberal democracy’s ability to offer a\ncoherent account of its own normative commitments.  It may even\nreflect Strauss’s fundamental commitment to peace (Howse, 2014). \nThe variety of claims about Strauss’s view of esotericism,\nmentioned above, is also fundamentally problematic. First, we have\nseen that a crucial, if usually overlooked, presupposition of\nStrauss’s view of esotericism is his concern with\nwritten texts. From the perspective of his own claims about\nesotericism, what may or may not have been Strauss’s own views\nare irrelevant to interpreting his work. \nSecond, there is no reason to conclude, as many do, that Strauss\nhimself wrote esoterically. For instance, Laurence Lampert’s\nview that “It is reasonable to suspect that a partisan of\nesoteric philosophy [i.e. Strauss] would himself write\nesoterically” (Lampert 2009, p. 63) simply does not follow from\nStrauss’s own claims. In Strauss’s words, “The only\npresentations of an author’s views which can be accepted as true\nare those ultimately borne out by his own explicit statements”\n(PAW, pp. 26–27). While Maimonides announces in the introduction\nto the Guide that he will write esoterically, Strauss makes\nno such statement. So too, in Strauss’s words, “the\nproblem inherent in the surface of things, and only in the surface of\nthings, is the heart of things” (TM, p. 13). Strauss tells us\nthat the theologico-political predicament is his focal issue. Why\nshould we, on the basis of Strauss’s own terms, think\notherwise? \nThird, suggestions that Strauss reads a multitude of authors\nesoterically simply do not hold up. Strauss only uses the term\n“esotericism” in Persecution and the Art of\nWriting and hence only in connection with Halevi, Spinoza, and\nMaimonides. \nAnd fourth, Strauss never claims to have discovered any secret in\nMaimonides or anyone else, but rather an understanding of the\nnecessity and limits of philosophy as it relates to revelation and\npolitics.  Indeed, as Strauss put it to Guttmann in 1949, “the\nproblem in principle of esotericism” is “the relationship between\nthought and society” (as quoted in Meier, 24n32).   \nAll of these issues aside, the most persistent and serious\nmisunderstanding of Strauss is that he promotes mass deception. On\nthis reading, Strauss suggests that the masses simply cannot handle\nthe truth and are in need of a class of political elites who, while\nthemselves pursuing the truth, support the noble lies necessary for\nany society to function. If this was Strauss’s view then, as\nMoshe Halbertal has recently and rightly noted, Strauss or “the\nStraussians are…naïve in believing that genuine elites can\nbe trusted. Trusting the existence of a selected group of wise men who\nare devoted to the collective good, and who are freed from ambition\nand self-interest because of their pursuit of truth, is as crude as\nthe belief in a society where masses disappear and deliberation and\nreason control human’s political choices” (CR, p. 163).\nHalbertal calls Strauss’s conception of esotericism\n“instrumental” because it “focuses on the harmful\nresults of the dissemination” [of the truth] (CR, p. 149). \nYet if we understand Strauss’s rather minimal claims about\nesotericism as an antidote to what he called the theologico-political\npredicament of modernity, then this reading of Strauss (regardless of\nwhat various Straussians claim) is not quite right. As we have seen,\nStrauss develops his conception of esotericism in an attempt to\nrethink the relation between theory and praxis. Esotericism is not\nmerely a political, or instrumental, tool for Strauss but also\nconcerns the very nature of truth. Esotericism points to what Strauss\nregards as the critical problem of philosophy, which concerns the\nself-sufficiency of reason. Halbertal is right that “Humans,\neven those who devote themselves to truth, are always embedded within\nthe boundaries of the human condition” (CR, p. 163). But this\nshould not be a criticism of Strauss but is better understood as\ndescribing the very impetus for the dialogical structure of\nStrauss’s account of esotericism. \nAlthough he does not apply it to Strauss, Halbertal provides a more\nhelpful rubric under which we may better understand Strauss’s\nconception of esotericism. Strauss’s view of esotericism is not\n“instrumental” but instead “essential,” which\nmeans that, to quote Halbertal, esotericism “is not the result\nof a strategy adopted by philosophy in its relation toward society,\nbut is part of the essence of the philosophical realm” (CR, p.\n57). As Halbertal notes, this position leads to a skeptical position\nthat Shlomo Pines (a professor of philosophy at the Hebrew University\nin Jerusalem from 1952–1990 and the translator of\nMaimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed into English for\nwhich Strauss provided the introduction) attributed to Maimonides (in\nan article which, incidentally, he published after Strauss’s\ndeath). While Pines’ concern was specifically with\nMaimonides’ account of language, Strauss saw esotericism as a\nmore generalized form of philosophical skepticism. To return to\nStrauss’s abiding interest in the relation between theory and\npractice, Strauss’s skepticism was also skeptical of itself in\nrecognizing the limits, political, moral, and philosophical, of\nskepticism. This recognition, for Strauss, is the work of a truly\ncritical philosophy. \nLeaving aside legitimate debate about the intellectual history of\nwestern civilization that Strauss sketches, problems remain with many\nof his philosophical contentions. Strauss certainly cannot be said to\nhave offered definitive arguments against historicism, definitive\narguments for or against revelation, or definitive arguments for a\nreturn to “nature.” Rather, in all these cases, one might\nargue, Strauss has merely begged the question. Strauss historicizes\nphilosophy in order to make an argument for timeless truth. His\nrational defenses of both the possibility of revelation and\nphilosophical rationalism are made on the basis of a critique of\nreason’s self-sufficiency. Finally, Strauss’s claims about\na return to “nature” rest not upon arguments for\n“nature” but rather upon arguments about the consequences\nof not having a conception of “nature.” \nIn the end, how one evaluates the circular nature of Strauss’s\nquestions and answers will depend upon how seriously one takes\nStrauss’s diagnosis of the “theologico-political\npredicament of modernity.” If one does not think Strauss has\nmade a serious case for the dire intellectual and political\nimplications of this predicament, then one will not be persuaded that\nStrauss has done much more than creatively re-read some pre-modern\nphilosophers, for better or for worse. If on the other hand, one finds\nStrauss’s diagnosis of the “theologico-political\npredicament” persuasive, one might think that Strauss has\naccomplished quite a lot by raising the questions of truth,\nrevelation, and nature anew in a day and age in which discussion of\nthese matters seems to have been deemed moot.","contact.mail":"batnitzk@princeton.edu","contact.domain":"princeton.edu"}]
