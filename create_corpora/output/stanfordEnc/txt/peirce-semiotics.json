Although sign theories have a\nlong history, Peirce's accounts are distinctive and innovative for\ntheir breadth and complexity, and for capturing the importance of\ninterpretation to signification. For Peirce, developing a\nthoroughgoing theory of signs was a central philosophical and\nintellectual preoccupation. The importance of semiotic for Peirce is\nwide ranging. As he himself said, “[…] it has never been\nin my power to study anything,—mathematics, ethics, metaphysics,\ngravitation, thermodynamics, optics, chemistry, comparative anatomy,\nastronomy, psychology, phonetics, economics, the history of science,\nwhist, men and women, wine, metrology, except as a study of\nsemiotic” (SS 1977, 85–6). Peirce also treated sign\ntheory as central to his work on logic, as the medium for inquiry and\nthe process of scientific discovery, and even as one possible means\nfor 'proving' his pragmatism. Its importance in Peirce's philosophy,\nthen, cannot be overestimated.\n\n\n\nAcross the course of his intellectual life, Peirce continually\nreturned to and developed his ideas about signs and semiotic and there\nare three broadly delineable accounts: a concise Early Account from\nthe 1860s; a complete and relatively neat Interim Account developed\nthrough the 1880s and 1890s and presented in 1903; and his\nspeculative, rambling, and incomplete Final Account developed between\n1906 and 1910. The following entry examines these three accounts, and\ntraces the changes that led Peirce to develop earlier accounts and\ngenerate new, more complex, sign theories. However, despite these\nchanges, Peirce's ideas on the basic structure of signs and\nsignification remain largely uniform throughout his\ndevelopments. Consequently, it is useful to begin with an account of\nthe basic structure of signs according to Peirce.\n\n\n\nIn one of his many definitions of a sign, Peirce writes: \n\nWhat we see here is Peirce's basic claim that signs consist of\nthree inter-related parts: a sign, an object, and an interpretant. For\nthe sake of simplicity, we can think of the sign as the signifier, for\nexample, a written word, an utterance, smoke as a sign for fire\netc. The object, on the other hand, is best thought of as whatever is\nsignified, for example, the object to which the written or uttered\nword attaches, or the fire signified by the smoke. The interpretant,\nthe most innovative and distinctive feature of Peirce's account, is\nbest thought of as the understanding that we have of the sign/object\nrelation. The importance of the interpretant for Peirce is that\nsignification is not a simple dyadic relationship between sign and\nobject: a sign signifies only in being interpreted. This makes the\ninterpretant central to the content of the sign, in that, the meaning\nof a sign is manifest in the interpretation that it generates in sign\nusers. Things are, however, slightly more complex than this and we\nshall look at these three elements in more detail.  The very first thing to note is that there are some potential\nterminological difficulties here. We appear to be saying that there\nare three elements of a sign, one of which is the sign. This is\nconfusing and does not fully capture Peirce's idea. Strictly speaking,\nfor Peirce, we are interested in the signifying element, and it\nis not the sign as a whole that signifies. In speaking of the sign as\nthe signifying element, then, he is more properly speaking of the sign\nrefined to those elements most crucial to its functioning as a\nsignifier. Peirce uses numerous terms for the signifying element\nincluding “sign”, “representamen”,\n“representation”, and “ground”. Here we shall\nrefer to that element of the sign responsible for signification as the\n“sign-vehicle”.   Peirce's idea that a sign does not signify in all respects and has\nsome particular signifying element is perhaps best made clear with an\nexample. Consider, for instance, a molehill in my lawn taken as a sign\nof moles. Not every characteristic of the molehill plays a part in\nsignifying the presence of moles. The color of the molehill plays a\nsecondary role since it will vary according to the soil from which it\nis composed. Similarly, the sizes of molehills vary according to the\nsize of the mole that makes them, so again, this feature is not\nprimary in the molehill's ability to signify. What is central here is\nthe causal connection that exists between the type of mound in my lawn\nand moles: since moles make molehills, molehills signify\nmoles. Consequently, primary to the molehill's ability to signify the\nmole is the brute physical connection between it and a mole. This is\nthe sign-vehicle of the sign. For Peirce, then, it is only some\nelement of a sign that enables it to signify its object, and when\nspeaking of the signifying element of the sign, or rather, the\nsign-vehicle, it is this qualified sign that he means.    Just as with the sign, not every characteristic of the object is\nrelevant to signification: only certain features of an object enable a\nsign to signify it. For Peirce, the relationship between the object of\na sign and the sign that represents it is one of determination: the\nobject determines the sign. Peirce's notion of determination is by no\nmeans clear and it is open to interpretation, but for our purposes, it\nis perhaps best understood as the placing of constraints or\nconditions on succesful signification by the object, rather than the\nobject causing or  generating  the sign. The idea is\nthat the object imposes certain parameters that a sign must fall\nwithin if it is to represent that object. However, only certain\ncharacteristics of an object are relevant to this process of\ndetermination. To see this in terms of an example, consider again the\ncase of the molehill.  The sign is the molehill, and the object of this sign is the\nmole. The mole determines the sign, in as much as, if the molehill is\nto succeed as a sign for the mole it must show the physical presence\nof the mole. If it fails to do this, it fails to be a sign of that\nobject. Other signs for this object, apart from the molehill, might\ninclude the presence of mole droppings, or a particular pattern of\nground subsidence on my lawns, but all such signs are constrained by\nthe need to show the physical presence of the mole. Clearly, not\neverything about the mole is relevant to this constraining process:\nthe mole might be a conventional black color or an albino, it might be\nmale or female, it might be young or old. None of these features,\nhowever, are essential to the constraints placed upon the\nsign. Rather, the causal connection between it and the mole is the\ncharacteristic that it imposes upon its sign, and it is this\nconnection that the sign must represent if it is to succeed in\nsignifying the mole. Although there are many features of the interpretant that bear\nfurther comment, here we shall mention just two. First, although we\nhave characterized the interpretant as the understanding we reach of\nsome sign/object relation, it is perhaps more properly thought of as\nthe translation or development of the original sign. The idea is that\nthe interpretant provides a translation of the sign, allowing us a\nmore complex understanding of the sign's object. Indeed, Liszka (1996)\nand Savan (1988) both emphasize the need to treat interpretants as\ntranslations, with Savan even suggesting Peirce should have called it\nthe translatant (Savan 1988, 41).  Second, just as with the\nsign/object relation, Peirce believes the sign/interpretant relation\nto be one of determination: the sign determines an\ninterpretant. Further, this determination is not determination in any\ncausal sense, rather, the sign determines an interpretant by using\ncertain features of the way the sign signifies its object to generate\nand shape our understanding. So, the way that smoke generates or\ndetermines an interpretant sign of its object, fire, is by focusing\nour attention upon the physical connection between smoke and fire.  For Peirce, then, any instance of signification contains a\nsign-vehicle, an object and interpretant. Moreover, the object\ndetermines the sign by placing constraints which any sign must meet if\nit is to signify the object. Consequently, the sign signifies its\nobject only in virtue of some of its features. Additionally, the sign\ndetermines an interpretant by focusing our understanding on certain\nfeatures of the signifying relation between sign and object. This\nenables us to understand the object of the sign more fully. \nAlthough this is a general picture of Peirce's ideas about sign\nstructure, and certain features are more or less present, or given\ngreater or lesser emphasis at various points in Peirce's development\nof his theory of signs, this triadic structure and the relation\nbetween the elements is present in all of Peirce's accounts. In what\nfollows, we shall see three of Peirce's attempts at giving a full\naccount of signs and signification, the corresponding sign typologies,\nlook at the transitions between these accounts, and examine some of\nthe issues that arise from them.  Peirce's earliest significant attempt at an account of signs comes\nin his 1867 paper “On A New List of Categories” (W2\n.49–58). In that account, we find the same basic sign structure\noutlined above: any sign, or representation as Peirce calls it at this\nearly stage, will have a sign-vehicle, an object, and an\ninterpretant. An important difference here though is how he thinks of\nthe relation between signs and interpretants. In particular, Peirce\nthought that whilst our interpreting the signifying relation between\nsign and object relied upon understanding the basis of signification\nin any given case, he also thought that the generated interpretant\nitself functioned as a further, more developed sign of the object in\nquestion. And of course, as a further sign, it will also signify that\nobject through some features, which again, we must interpret, and\ngenerate a further interpretant. As will be obvious, this leads to an\ninfinite chain of signs. If any sign must generate an interpretant in\norder to be a sign, and any sign is itself the interpretant of some\nfurther sign, then clearly, there must be an infinity of signs both\nproceeding and preceding from any given instance of\nsignification. Some scholars (for example, (Short 2004) and (Short 2007)) think that\ninfinite semiosis is a characteristic only of Peirce's early\naccount. Others, (Liszka 1996, Savan 1988) treat infinite semiosis as\npresent in all of Peirce's accounts. We shall return to the issue of\ninfinite semiosis in the early account below. First, we shall look at\nthe types of sign to which Peirce's early account gives rise.   \n\nPeirce thought that “representations” generate further\ninterpretants in one of three possible ways. First, via “a mere\ncommunity in some quality” (W2 .56). These he calls likenesses, but\nthey are more familiarly known as icons. Second, those “whose\nrelation to their objects consists in a correspondence in fact”\n(W2 .56) are termed indices. And finally, those “whose relation\nto their objects is an imputed character” (W2. 56) are called\nsymbols. Put simply, if we come to interpret a sign as standing\nfor its object in virtue of some shared quality, then the sign is an\nicon. Peirce's early examples of icons are portraits and noted\nsimilarities between the letters p and b (W2. 53–4). If on the other\nhand, our interpretation comes in virtue of some brute, existential\nfact, causal connections say, then the sign is an index. Early\nexamples include the weathercock, and the relationship between the\nmurderer and his victim (W2. 53–4). And finally, if we generate an\ninterpretant in virtue of some observed general or conventional\nconnection between sign and object, then the sign is a symbol. Early\nexamples include the words “homme” and “man” sharing a\nreference. (W2. 53–4). \n\nThis, then, is the very first outing for Peirce's famous division of\nsigns into Icons, Indexes, and Symbols. Although Peirce's precise\nthoughts about the nature of this division were to change at various\npoints in his development of sign theory, the division nonetheless\nremains throughout his work. There are, however, some important\nfeatures to this early account that mark it out from the later\ndevelopments. We shall look at two of these features here: the\nimportance of thought-signs; and infinite semiosis.  \n\nAn interesting feature of Peirce's early account is that he is keen to\nassociate signs with cognition. In particular, Peirce claims that all\nthought is in signs (W2. 213). We can see this from Peirce's early\nidea that every interpretant is itself a further sign of the signified\nobject. Since interpretants are the interpreting thoughts we have of\nsignifying relations, and these interpreting thoughts are themselves\nsigns, it seems to be a straight-forward consequence that all thoughts\nare signs, or as Peirce calls them “thought-signs”. One\ninteresting consequence of this is that in the early account, Peirce\nis quick to dismiss the importance and relevance of icons and\nindices. \n\nThis gives Peirce's early account of signs a rather narrow scope; it\nis concerned primarily with the general and conventional signs of\nwhich our language and cognition consist. The reason for this narrow\nfocus is simple: for Peirce, since symbols are “potentially\ngeneral” and fall under the remit of general rules, they are a\nfit subject of study for his primary focus, logic. This early account,\nthen, focuses mainly on general and conventional signs, those signs\nidentified by Peirce as symbols. Icons and indices, although noted at\nthis early stage, are considered of secondary philosophical\nimportance. As we shall see later, this narrow focus is something that\nPeirce was later to revise. \n\nAs previously noted, part and parcel of Peirce's early account of\nsigns is that an infinity of further signs both proceed and precede\nfrom any given sign. This is a consequence of the way Peirce thinks of\nthe elements of signs at this early stage and seems to stem from his\nidea that interpretants are to count as further signs, and signs are\ninterpretants of earlier signs. Since any sign must determine an\ninterpretant in order to count as a sign, and interpretants are\nthemselves signs, infinite chains of signs seem to become conceptually\nnecessary. \n\nTo see this, imagine a chain of signs with either a first or a last\nsign. The final sign that terminates the semiotic process will have no\ninterpretant; if it did, that interpretant would function as a further\nsign and generate a further interpretant, and the final sign would, in\nfact, not terminate the process. However, since any sign must\ndetermine an interpretant to count as a sign, the final sign would not\nbe a sign unless it had an interpretant. Similarly, a first sign could\nnot be the interpretant of a preceding sign. If it were, that previous\nsign would be the first sign. However, since any sign must be an\ninterpretant of a previous sign, a first sign would not be a sign\nunless it was also an interpretant of a previous sign. The problem is\nthat if we allow a final sign with no interpretant, or a first sign\nwhich is not the interpretant or some earlier sign, then we have\nfailed signs in the semiotic process. This affects the rest of the\nsemiotic chain causing something like a collapse of dominoes. For\nexample, if the final sign fails to be a sign in virtue of generating\nno interpretant, then since that failed sign is supposed to act as the\ninterpretant of the previous sign and function as a further sign in\nits own right, it has also failed to be an interpretant. The\nconsequence of this is that the previous sign has failed to generate a\nproper interpretant and so failed to be a sign. The consequence of\nthis is that…and so on. The alternative is not to countenance\nterminating signs. And obviously, if we cannot end the semiotic\nprocess then signs continue generating signs ad infinitum. \n\nPeirce was both aware and untroubled by infinite semiosis. In part,\nthis is due to the anti-Cartesian project carried out in Peirce's work\nin the 1860s. A significant part of this project for Peirce is the\ndenial of intuitions, something that Peirce took as a key assumption\nof Cartesian philosophical method. Given that Peirce defines\n“intuition” as “a cognition not determined by a\nprevious cognition of the same object” (W2. 193), it seems clear\nthat the infinite procession of thought-signs generated by earlier\nthought-signs and in turn generating further thought-signs is part and\nparcel of the denial of intuitions. However, in later developments to\nhis sign theory, despite never explicitly relinquishing infinite\nsemiosis, many of the concepts that lead to it are replaced or\nrevised, and the concept becomes less prominent in Peirce's work.  \n\nIn 1903, Peirce gave a series of lectures at Harvard, and at The\nLowell Institute. Part of these lectures was an account of\nsigns. However, the 1903 account of signs showed considerable\ndevelopments to the early account of the 1860s. First, where the\nearly account suggested three classes of sign, the 1903 account\nsuggests ten classes of sign. Second, where the account the 1860s\ntreats the general sign, or symbol, as the main focus of sign theory,\nthe 1903 account counts many more sign types as within the focus of\nphilosophy and logic. Third, Peirce dropped the claim that an infinite\nchain of signs precedes any given sign (see Short 2004, 221–2). \n\nThese changes seem to be a consequence of developments in symbolic\nlogic made by Peirce and his Johns Hopkins student, Oscar Mitchell, in\nthe early 1880s. As is well known, during this time, and\nindependently of Frege, Peirce and Mitchell developed quantification\ntheory (see Peirce (1883), and (W5. 162–191)). An essential part of\nthis development was the inclusion of singular propositions and\nindividual variables for objects that cannot be picked out be definite\ndescriptions. Peirce treated these non-general signs as indices, which\nin turn led him to identify the index as an essential part of\nlogic. This made his earlier account of signs seem\nunderdeveloped. (See, for instance, Short (2004, 219–222), Hookway\n(2000, 127–131), and Murphey (1961, 299–300)). This appears to have\nled Peirce to take signs other than the symbol more seriously. In\nparticular, it led Peirce to realize that some symbolic signs had\ndistinctly indexical (that is non-general) features. Similarly,\nsymbols with heavily iconic features, especially in mathematics (see\nHookway 1985 Ch 6), were more important than he thought. What this\nmeant, of course, was that the account of the 1860s was now woefully\ninadequate to the task of capturing the range of signs and\nsignification that Peirce thought important for philosophy and\nlogic. \n\nPeirce's 1903 account of signs, then, is notable for its broader\nscope, relative neatness, and completeness. In it Peirce returns to\nthe basic sign structure we gave above and by paying close attention\nto those elements of signs and the various interactions between them\ngives what seems to be an extensive account of signification, and an\nexhaustive typology of signs far beyond the range of his early account\nof the 1860s. To understand Peirce's 1903 account, we must return to\nthe three elements of signification, namely, the sign-vehicle, the\nobject, and the interpretant and see how Peirce thinks their function\nin signification leads to an exhaustive classification of sign\ntypes. \n\nRecall that Peirce thought signs signify their objects not through all\ntheir features, but in virtue of some particular feature. By 1903, for\nreasons related to his work on phenomenology, Peirce thought the\ncentral features of sign-vehicles could be divided into three broad\nareas, and consequently, that signs could be classified\naccordingly. This division depends upon whether sign-vehicles signify\nin virtue of qualities, existential facts, or conventions and\nlaws. Further, signs with these sign-vehicles are classified as\nqualisigns, sinsigns, and legisigns\nrespectively. \n Examples of signs whose sign-vehicle relies upon a quality are\ndifficult to imagine, but a particularly clear example, used by David\nSavan, is this: \n There are many elements to the colored chip as a sign, but it is only\nits color that matters to its ability to signify. Any sign whose\nsign-vehicle relies, as with this example, on simple abstracted\nqualities is called a qualisign. \n An example of a sign whose sign-vehicle uses existential facts is\nsmoke as a sign for fire; the causal relation between the fire and\nsmoke allows the smoke to act as a signifier. Other cases are the\nmolehill example used earlier, and temperature as a sign for a\nfever. Any sign whose sign-vehicle relies upon existential connections\nwith its object is named, by Peirce, a sinsign. \n And finally, the third kind of sign is one whose crucial signifying\nelement is primarily due to convention, habit or law. Typical examples\nwould be traffic lights as sign of priority, and the signifying\ncapability of words; these sign-vehicles signify in virtue of the\nconventions surrounding their use. Peirce calls signs whose\nsign-vehicles function in this way legisigns. \n Just as Peirce thought signs could be classified according to whether\ntheir sign-vehicles function in virtue of qualities, existential\nfacts, or conventions and laws, he thought signs were similarly\nclassifiable according to how their object functioned in\nsignification. Recall that, for Peirce, objects “determine” their\nsigns. That is to say, the nature of the object constrains the nature\nof the sign in terms of what successful signification requires. Again,\nPeirce thought the nature of these constraints fell into three broad\nclasses: qualitative, existential or physical, and conventional and\nlaw-like. Further, if the constraints of successful signification\nrequire that the sign reflect qualitative features of the object, then\nthe sign is an icon. If the constraints of successful\nsignification require that the sign utilize some existential or\nphysical connection between it and its object, then the sign is an\nindex. And finally, if successful signification of the\nobject requires that the sign utilize some convention, habit, or\nsocial rule or law that connects it with its object, then the sign is\na symbol. \n This is a trichotomy with which we are already familiar from the\nearly account, and indeed, the examples of icons, indices, and symbols\nare largely the same as before: icons are portraits and paintings,\nindices are natural and causal signs, symbols are words and so\non. There are, however, additional instances, for example, icons\ninclude diagrams used in geometrical reasoning, indices include\npointing fingers and proper names, and symbols including broad speech\nacts like assertion and judgment, all of which suggests a considerable\nbroadening of this trichotomy. It is well worth noting, though, that\nby 1903 Peirce was aware that it would be hard, if not impossible, to\nfind any pure instances of icons and indices. Rather, he began to\nsuspect that icons and indices were always partly symbolic or\nconventional. To try to capture this, Peirce experimented with some\nadditional terminology and types of icon and index. These he called\nthe hypo-icon (see CP2 .276 1903) and the sub-index (see CP 2.330\n1903) respectively. We shall not explore these signs further here (see (Goudge 1965) and (Atkin 2005) for more on Peirce's view of indices, and (Legg 2008) for more on icons), but it is worth noting that by 1903, the simple icon/index/symbol\ntrichotomy was something of an abstraction, and Peirce was aware that\nany single sign may display some combination of iconic, indexical and\nsymbolic characteristics.  \n As with the sign-vehicle and the object, Peirce thought we could\nclassify signs in terms of their relation with their\ninterpretant. Again, he identifies three categories according to which\nfeature of the relationship with its object a sign uses in generating\nan interpretant. Further, as with the classification of the sign in\nterms of the sign-vehicle and the object, Peirce identifies qualities,\nexistential facts, or conventional features as the basis for\nclassifying the sign in terms of its interpretant. \n If the sign determines an interpretant by focusing our understanding\nof the sign upon the qualitative features it employs in signifying its\nobject, then the sign is classified as a rheme. Examples are\nnot straightforward, but one way of understanding rhemes, is to think\nof them as unsaturated predicates like, “— is a dog”, “— is\nhappy”, “— loves —” or “— gives—to —”, and so\non. Whenever we understand a sign in terms of qualities it suggests\nits object may have, we generate an interpretant that qualifies its\nsign as a rheme. If, on the other hand, a sign determines an\ninterpretant by focusing our understanding of the sign upon the\nexistential features it employs in signifying an object, then the sign\nis a dicent. We can think of dicents is as saturated\npredicates, or propositions, like “Fido is a dog”, “Larry is happy”,\n“Fido loves Larry”, “Larry gives food to Fido”, and so on. And\nfinally, if a sign determines an interpretant by focusing our\nunderstanding on some conventional or law-like features employed in\nsignifying the object, then the sign is a delome, or as Peirce\nmost frequently, but confusingly, calls them,\narguments. Further, just as we can think of a rheme as an\nunsaturated predicate, and a dicent as a proposition, we can think of\nthe delome as an argument or rule of inference. Our ability to\nunderstand a sign in terms of its place in some pattern of reasoning\nand system of signs enables us to derive information from it (by\ndeductive reasoning) or make conjectures about it (by inductive and\nabductive reasoning). So, whenever we come to understand a sign as\nfocusing our attention upon some conventional feature of its\nrelationship with object, that is, enabling us to understand the sign\nas part of a rule governed system of knowledge and signs etc., we have\nan interpretant that qualifies a sign as a delome (or argument). \n Peirce believed that the three elements, and the respective\nclassifications they imposed upon signs, could be combined to give a\ncomplete list of sign types. That is, since a sign has a sign-vehicle\nit can be classified as either a qualisign, a sinsign, or\nlegisign. Additionally, since that sign has an object it can be\nclassified as either an icon, an index, or a symbol. And finally,\nsince that sign will also determine an interpretant it can be\nclassified as either a rheme, a dicent, or a delome.  Each sign is\nthen classifiable as some combination of each of its three elements,\nthat is, as either one of the three types of sign-vehicle, plus one of\nthe three types of object, plus one of the three types of\ninterpretant. Initially, this seems to yield twenty-seven possible\nclassificatory combinations, but, because of certain of Peirce's\nphenomenological theories, there are restrictions on how we can\ncombine the different elements that mean there are, in fact, only ten\ntypes of sign. (For more on the relation between Peirce's\nphenomenological categories, and his sign typology, see (Lizska 1996)\nand (Savan 1988)) \n The rules for the permissible combinations are actually quite simple\nso long as we bear two things in mind. First, types of each element\nare classifiable as either a quality, an existential fact, or a\nconvention. That is, across the three elements of a sign, there are\nthree types deriving from qualities (the qualisign, the icon, and the\nrheme), three deriving from existential facts, (the sinsign, the\nindex, and the dicent), and three deriving from conventions (the\nlegisign, the symbol, and the delome). Second, the classification of\nthe interpretant depends upon the classification of the object, which\nin turn depends upon the classification of the sign-vehicle. The rules\nthat determine permissible classifications, then, are that if an\nelement is classified as a quality, then its dependent element may\nonly be a classified as a quality. If an element is classified as an\nexistential fact, then its dependent element may be classified as\neither an existential fact, or a quality. And if an element is\nclassified as a convention, then its dependent element may be\nclassified as either a convention, an existential fact, or a\nquality. This leaves us with ten permissible combinations between a\nsign-vehicle, object and interpretant, and so ten possible kinds of\nsigns. They look something like this: \n These ten types of sign are simply called after the combination of\ntheir elements: an ordinary proposition is a\ndicentic-symbolic-legisign, a spontaneous cry a\nrhematic-indexical-sinsign, and so on. \n Despite its apparent completeness and complexity, however, Peirce was\nsoon to begin rethinking his 1903 account of signs and over the final\nyears of his life, he introduced further complexities and nuances. \n During the last part of his life the majority of Peirce's\nphilosophical output concerned semiotic, and he developed his account\nof signs far beyond the 1903 theory. There seem to be two reasons for\nthis. First, Peirce was geographically and intellectually isolated and\nhis main outlet was correspondence with the English woman, Lady\nVictoria Welby. Welby wrote on various philosophical topics and shared\nPeirce's interests in signs and meaning. This seems to have given\nPeirce a willing and sympathetic audience for his developing ideas on\nsigns. The second reason seems to have been his growing appreciation of the\nconnections between the semiotic process and the process of\ninquiry. Peirce always thought of his philosophy in a systematic and\narchitectonic way. However, around 1902, an application for funding to\nthe Carnegie Institute saw him express more clearly the connections\nbetween different aspects of his philosophy. The application failed,\nbut Peirce had returned to thinking about the place of sign theory in\nhis broader philosophy. In particular, he came to see sign theory more\nclearly as part of the logic of scientific discovery, that is, as\ncentral to his account of inquiry. We shall not review Peirce's\naccount of inquiry here, but as an end directed process leading from\ndoubt-prone to doubt-proof beliefs, Peirce began to see a similar\nend-directedness running through the semiotic process. This kind of\nthinking lead Peirce to reassess his account of signs and sign\nstructure: the connection between the process of inquiry and sign\nchains led Peirce to notice subtleties and nuances that had previously\nbeen transparent to him. In particular, it led him to see chains of\nsigns as tending towards a definite but idealized end rather than\nprogressing ad infinitum. Since at the idealized end of inquiry we\nhave a complete understanding of some object, there need be no further\ninterpretant of that object; our understanding cannot be developed any\nfurther. (See Ransdell (1977) and Short (2004) and (2007) for more on the\nconnections between Peirce's later account and the end-directed\nprocess of inquiry. Indeed, Short (2007) represents the fullest and best developed account of 'telic' interpretations of Peirce's semiotic to date). \n The first effect of Peirce's greater appreciation of the parallels\nbetween inquiry and his sign theory is a distinction between the\nobject of the sign as it we understand at some given point in the\nsemiotic process, and the object of the sign as it stands at the end\nof that process. The former he calls the immediate object, and\nthe later he calls the dynamic object. A neat way of capturing\nthis distinction is as the different objects arising from the “two\nanswers to the question: what object does this sign refer to? One is\nthe answer that could be given when the sign was used; and the other\nis the one we could give when our scientific knowledge is\ncomplete”. (Hookway 1985, 139). \n The dynamic object is, in some senses, the object that generates a\nchain of signs. The aim of a sign chain is to arrive at a full\nunderstanding of an object and so assimilate that object into the\nsystem of signs. Using slightly more simplistic terms, Ransdell (1977,\n169) describes the dynamic object as the “object as it really is”, and\nHookway (1985, 139) describes it as “the object as it is known to be\n[at the end of inquiry]”. Indeed, Hookway's description shows an acute\nawareness of the connection between the dynamic object and the process\nof inquiry in Peirce's later sign theory. An example, from Liszka\n(1996, 23), captures Peirce's idea quite clearly: taking a petroleum\ntank half full with fuel, a variety of signs for this half-full state\nare available. Perhaps there is a fuel gauge attached to the tank, or\nperhaps the tank makes a distinctive sound when we strike it and so\non. But, despite these various signs, the object underlying them all\nis the actual level of fuel in the petroleum tank; this is the dynamic\nobject. \n Ransdell (1977, 169) describes the immediate object as “what we, at\nany time, suppose the object to be”, and Hookway (1985, 139) describes\nit as “the object at the time it is first used and interpreted”. The\nimmediate object, then, is not some additional object distinct from\nthe dynamic object but is merely some informationally incomplete\nfacsimile of the dynamic object generated at some interim stage in a\nchain of signs. Returning to the petroleum tank example, when we\nstrike the tank, the tone that it emits (which functions as the\nsign-vehicle) represents to us that the tank is not full (but it does\nnot tell us the precise level of fuel). The immediate object, then, is\na less-than-full-tank. \n Clearly, the immediate and dynamic objects of a sign are intimately\nlinked and Peirce consistently describes and introduces the two\ntogether. (See, (CP 4. 536 (1896)). However, the connection between\nthe two is most clear when we consider the connections between sign\nchains and inquiry. The dynamic object is, as we have suggested, the\ngoal and end point that drives the semiotic process, and the immediate\nobject is our grasp of that object at any point in that\nprocess. Ransdell, for instance, says: \n Put this way, it is clear how Peirce's growing concern to capture the\nparallels between semiosis and the process of inquiry leads him to\nidentify two objects for the sign. \n\nJust as with the object(s) of the sign, the parallels between semiotic\nand inquiry result in a similar division of interpretants. As a chain\nof signs moves towards a final end there are different interpretants\nplaying different but important roles. Peirce identifies three\ndifferent ways in which we grasp the way a sign stands for an\nobject. He calls these three types of interpretant, the immediate\ninterpretant, the dynamic interpretant and the final\ninterpretant and describes them like this. We shall examine each of these in turn, but to get a clearer\nunderstanding of the three interpretants it is helpful to look, very\nbriefly, at Peirce's three grades of clarity, or understanding since\nPeirce took these to inform his division of interpretants. \n In his 1878 paper, “How To Make Our Ideas Clear” (W3, 257–275) Peirce\nintroduces three grades of clarity, or levels of understanding. In\nthis paper, he introduces his famous pragmatic maxim as a development\nof rationalist notions of “clear and distinct ideas”. Combining his\npragmatic maxim with notions of clarity from Descartes and Leibniz,\nPeirce identifies three grades of understanding. The first grade of\nclarity is to have an unreflective grasp of some concept in everyday\nexperience. The second grade of clarity is to have, or be capable of\nproviding, a general definition of that concept. The third grade of\nclarity, though, comes from Peirce's famous statement of the pragmatic\nmaxim: \n A full understanding of some concept, then, involves familiarity\nwith it in day-to-day encounters, the ability to offer some general\ndefinition of it, and knowing what effects to expect from holding that\nconcept to be true. \n Although these grades of clarity are part of Peirce's pragmatism, his\ngreater understanding of the interconnectedness of his thought led him\nto realize that they were also crucial to his work on semiotic. In\nparticular, he saw the three grades of clarity or understanding as\nreflected in his notion of the interpretant and of course felt that\nthe interpretant also had three grades or divisions. Peirce himself\nsays: \n Here, then, Peirce identifies the first grade of clarity with the\ndynamic interpretant, the second grade with the immediate\ninterpretant, and the third grade with the final interpretant. \n As its identification with the second grade of clarity suggests, the\nimmediate interpretant is a general definitional understanding of the\nrelationship between the sign and dynamic object. In an extended\nexample, where the dynamic object is the weather on a stormy day,\nPeirce describes the immediate interpretant as “the schema in [our]\nimagination, i.e. the vague Image of what there is in common to the\ndifferent images of a stormy day” (CP8 .314 (1907)). The immediate\ninterpretant, then, is something like recognition of the syntax of the\nsign and the more general features of its meaning. Indeed, Peirce\nseems to take the immediate interpretant to be “all that is explicit\nin the sign apart from its context and circumstances of utterance”\n(CP5 .473 (1907)). Also instructive is David Savan's description of\nthe immediate interpretant as the: \n In terms of an example where ordinary sentences are the signs, the\nimmediate interpretant will involve something like our recognition of\ngrammatical categories, syntactic structures and conventional rules of\nuse. For instance, without knowing anything about its context of\nutterance, we can surmise certain things about the sentence, “we don't\nwant to hurt him, do we?”. We know it is a question, we know it\nconcerns doing harm to some person, a male, and so on. These things\nare part of the immediate interpretant of the sign. \n The second type of interpretant that any sign must have is the\ndynamic interpretant. This is our understanding of the sign/dynamic\nobject relationship at some actual instance in the chain of\nsigns. Peirce describes the dynamic interpretant as the “effect\nactually produced on the mind” (CP8 .343 (1908)), or as the “actual\neffect which the sign, as a sign, really determines” (CP4 .536\n(1906)). The dynamic interpretant, then, is the understanding we\nreach, or which the sign determines, at any particular semiotic\nstage. \n To continue with linguistic examples, we know that the dynamic\ninterpretant is the actual interpretation we make, or understanding we\nreach, in the first instance of interpretation. For instance, when you\nsay to me whilst pointing at some cowardly woman we know, “I saw her\nduck under the table”, the dynamic interpretant is my understanding\nthat you are the utterer, that I am the addressee, and that you saw\nour cowardly acquaintance hide beneath a table. \n There is also an interesting connection between the dynamic\ninterpretant and the immediate object. As the understanding we\nactually reach at any particular point in the sign chain, the dynamic\ninterpretant represents an incomplete understanding, or\ninterpretation, of the dynamic object. More important, though, is that\nthe immediate object of some sign in a sign chain consists of the\nactual interpretations made previously, that is, it consists of the\ndynamic interpretants from earlier stages in the sign chain. As\nRansdell (1977, 169) puts it, the “immediate object is, in other\nwords, the funded result of all interpretation prior to the\ninterpretation of the given sign”. The dynamic interpretant then, is\nthe actual interpretation or understanding we make at some point in\nthe semiotic process, and also constitutes, along with previous\ndynamic interpretants, the immediate object, or partial understanding\nwe have of the dynamic object at any particular point in the semiotic\nprocess. \n Peirce describes the final interpretant as, “that which would finally\nbe decided to be the true interpretation if consideration of the\nmatter were carried so far that an ultimate opinion were reached” (CP8\n.184 (1909)). Elsewhere he describes it as the “effect that would be\nproduced on the mind by the sign after sufficient development of\nthought” (CP8 .343 (1908)). The final interpretant, then, seems to be\nwhat our understanding of the dynamic object would be at the end of\ninquiry, that is, if we had a reached a true understanding of the\ndynamic object. Peirce's notion of inquiry is clearly central here. As\nHookway points out, we might best define the final interpretant as the\nunderstanding: \n As an example, consider again the kinds of utterance that we have\nalready looked at. In such a case as your uttering, “I saw her duck\nunder the table”, the final interpretant would be the understanding\nwhere there is “no latitude of interpretation at all” (CP5 .447\n(1905)), that is, where the meanings of the words, the identity of the\nagents involved and so on, are absolutely determinate. So, the final\ninterpretant of your utterance of “I saw her duck under the\ntable” is my coming to a determinate understanding of what you\nmean. We can envisage how this would come about, by my asking a\nvariety of questions, like “are you using ‘duck’ as a verb\nor a noun?”, or even “are you talking to me?” and developing a series\nof dynamic interpretants that get us closer and closer to the final\ninterpretant. \n Just as the dynamic interpretant has clear connections with other\nelements of Peirce's semiotic, so too does the final interpretant. As\nshould be clear, from the connections that emerge from the notion of\ninquiry, the final interpretant interacts strongly with the dynamic\nobject. The final interpretant, then, is important to our\nunderstanding of the dynamic object in a couple of ways. First, it is\nthe point where our grasp of the dynamic object would be complete and,\naccording to Ransdell (1977, 169–170), is where the immediate object\nand the dynamic object coincide. This represents the full assimilation\nor integration of the dynamic object into our system of signs. Second,\nthe final interpretant functions as an exemplar or normative standard\nby which we can judge our actual interpretative responses to the\nsign. As David Savan puts it, “Peirce's intention was to identify the\nthird type of interpretant as providing a norm or standard by which\nparticular stages (Dynamical Interpretants) of an historical process\nmay be judged.” (Savan 1988, 62). \n This identification of the six elements of a sign is the clearest and\nleast controversial part of Peirce's final sign theories. Most of what\nwe know about Peirce's final account is gleaned from letters,\npartially worked out manuscripts and other miscellaneous\nitems. Consequently, there is much to the final account that is still\nunclear, unsatisfactory, incomplete, and controversial. In this final\nsection, we shall look at two of the most interesting issues\nsurrounding the final account: Peirce's projected Final Classification\nof sixty-six signs; and what appears to be his identification of\nadditional interpretants. \n Just as the Early and Interim Accounts include a corresponding\nclassification of sign types, Peirce's final account holds similar\ntypological ambitions. Peirce states explicitly that there are\nsixty-six classes of sign in his final typology. (See\nEP2. 481). Strictly speaking, the six elements that we have detailed\nyield only twenty eight sign types, but we are interested in Peirce's\nvery final typology. He believes that we can obtain these sixty-six\nclasses, rather in the manner of the 1903 typology, by identifying ten\nelements of signs and signification, each of which has three\nqualifying classes, and then working out their permissible\ncombinations. These ten elements include the six sign elements\nidentified above, plus four other elements that focus on the relation\nbetween signs, objects and interpretants. The ten elements and their\nrespective sign types, taken from Peirce's 1908 letters to Lady Welby\n(EP2 483–491), then, are as follows: \n The reason that Peirce believes these ten elements will yield\nsixty-six classes is clear enough, the same combinatorial\nconsiderations given for the interim typology (outlined above in 3.4)\napply here. However, the precise manner and order in which these\nelements interact will determine what the sixty-six classes of signs\nwill look like in the final typology. Unfortunately, these ten\ndivisions and their classes represent a baffling array of\nunder-explained terminology, and there is little to indicate precisely\nhow we should set about the task of combining them. Even though we may\nbe confident on the number of signs in the final typology, other\ndetails are sketchy and underdeveloped, and there still exists no\nfully satisfactory account of the sixty-six classes. As Nathan Houser\npoints out, “a sound and detailed extension of Peirce's analysis\nof signs to his full set of ten divisions and sixty-six classes is\nperhaps the most pressing problem for Peircian\nsemiotics”. (Houser 1992, 502). \n There is, of course, good work on the final typology (see (Burks and\nWeiss 1949), (Sanders 1970), (Savan 1988), (Jappy 1989), (Muller\n1994), and (Farias and Queiroz 2003) for the best of this work), but\nultimately, it is not clear that any account will overcome the\nproblems posed by the incomplete and cursory nature of the final\naccount. Indeed, it is not clear that Peirce himself was fully at ease\nwith his final typology and how its elements should hang together. As\nhe himself said: \n As is common with all of Peirce's work in philosophy, various changes\nin terminology and subtleties with accompanying neologisms occur from\none piece of work to the next. His work on interpretants is no\ndifferent. At various points in his final accounts of signs, Peirce\ndescribes the division of interpretants as being: immediate, dynamic\nand final; or as emotional, energetic, and logical; or as naïve,\nrogate and normal; or as intentional, effective and communicational;\nor even destinate, effective and explicit. As Liszka (1990, 20) notes,\n“the received view in Peirce scholarship suggests that the\ndivisions of interpretant into immediate, dynamic, and final are\narchetypal, all other divisions being relatively synonymous with these\ncategories.” There are, however, some dissenters from this\nview. \n In discussing the interpretant, Peirce describes one of the\ntrichotomies above as follows: \n For some scholars, this describes a division distinct from the\nimmediate/dynamic/final trichotomy. Fitzgerald (1966, 78) claims that\nsince emotional, energetic and logical interpretants are actual\neffects, they must be seen as three sub-types of the dynamic\ninterpretant. This is because dynamic interpretants are described by\nPeirce as the effect actually produced on the mind. Short (1981, 1996,\nand 2004) thinks that each of the immediate, dynamic and final\ninterpretants may be further sub-divided into emotional, energetic and\nlogical. In particular, Short thinks that the immediate/dynamic/final\ntrichotomy describes the interpretant at some stage of an end-directed\nsemiotic process, whereas the emotional/energetic/logical trichotomy\ndescribes the types of interpretant possible at any given stage. \n There are simple textual reasons that count against Fitzgerald's\nclaims. For instance, Peirce describes the dynamic interpretant as\nderiving its character from action (CP8 .315 (1904)), but later says,\n“action cannot be a logical interpretant” (CP5 .491\n(1906)). This seems to make the two inconsistent. (See Liszka (1990,\n21) for more on the problems with Fitzgerald's claim). Moreover, this\ninconsistency seems to suggest a problem for Short's view since his\naccount also suggests that the dynamic interpretant should include the\nlogical interpretant as a subdivision (Short 1981, 213). Short,\nhowever, claims textual support for his own view from instances where\nPeirce mentions the emotional/energetic/logical trichotomy alongside\nthe apparently separate claim that signs have three\ninterpretants. (Short sites (CP8 .333 (1904)) and (CP4 .536\n(1906)). Short takes this as suggesting that the two should be treated\nas different and distinct trichotomies. (Short 2004, 235). \n How far the textual evidence on the matter will prove decisive is\nunclear, especially given the fragmentary nature of Peirce's final\nwork on signs. However, one or two things militate in favor of the\n“received view”. First, Peirce is notorious for experimenting with\nterminology, especially when trying to pin down his own ideas, or\ndescribe the same phenomenon from different angles. Second, it is\nunclear why trichotomies like the\nintentional/effectual/communicational should count as terminological\nexperiments whilst the emotional/energetic/logical counts as a\ndistinct division. And finally, there is little provision in Peirce's\nprojected sixty-six classes of signs for the kind of additional\nclassifications imposed by further subdivisions of the\ninterpretant. (For more on this discussion see, (Liszka 1990 and\n1996), (Fitzgerald 1966), (Lalor 1997), (Short 1981, 1996, and\n2004)).","contact.mail":"albert.atkin@mq.edu.au","contact.domain":"mq.edu.au"}]
