But if not the name, the ideas themselves are\nvery ancient, and any survey of the history of philosophy will uncover\nnumerous pantheist or pantheistically inclined thinkers; although it\nshould also be noted that in many cases all that history has preserved\nfor us are second-hand reportings of attributed doctrines, any\nreconstruction of which is too conjectural to provide much by way of\nphilosophical illumination.\n\n\nAt its most general, pantheism may be understood positively as the view\nthat God is identical with the cosmos, the view that there exists\nnothing which is outside of God, or else negatively as the rejection of\nany view that considers God as distinct from the universe.\n\n\nHowever, given the complex and contested nature of the concepts\ninvolved, there is insufficient consensus among philosophers to permit\nthe construction of any more detailed definition not open to serious\nobjection from some quarter or other. Moreover, the label is a\ncontroversial one, where strong desires either to appropriate or to\nreject it often serve only to obscure the actual issues, and it would\nbe a sad irony if pantheism revealed itself to be most like a\ntraditional religion in its sectarian disputes over just what counts as\n‘true pantheism.’ Therefore pantheism should not be thought\nof as a single codifiable position. Rather it should be understood as a\ndiverse family of distinct doctrines; many of whom would be\nsurprised—and, indeed, disconcerted—to find themselves regarded\nas members of a single household. Further, since the concept has porous\nand disputed boundaries there is no clear consensus on just who\nqualifies, no definitive roll-call of past pantheists. Given this\nsituation the range of things that may be usefully said about\nall pantheisms is perhaps limited, but nonetheless a variety\nof concepts may be clarified, the nature of contentious issues\nexplored, and the range of possible options more precisely mapped\nout.\n\n\n\nThere are several different ways to think about pantheism. (1) Many\nof the world’s religious traditions and spiritual writings are\nmarked by pantheistic ideas and feelings. This is particularly so for\nexample, in Hinduism of the Advaita Vedanta school, in some varieties\nof Kabbalistic Judaism, in Celtic spirituality, and in Sufi mysticism.\n(2) Another vital source of pantheistic ideas is to be found in\nliterature, for example, in such writers as Goethe, Coleridge,\nWordsworth, Emerson, Walt Whitman, D.H. Lawrence, and Robinson Jeffers.\nAlthough it should be added that, far from being limited to high\nculture, pantheistic themes are familiar, too, in popular media, for\nexample in such films as Star Wars, Avatar, and The Lion\nKing. (3) Thirdly, as it is in this article, pantheism may be\nconsidered philosophically; that is, a critical examination\nmay be made of its central ideas with respect to their meaning, their\ncoherence, and the case to be made for or against their acceptance. \n\nA good way to understand any view is to appreciate the kind of\ndrives that may push someone towards it. What arguments may be given\nfor pantheism? Although there are a great many different individual\nlines of reasoning that might be offered, generally they may be placed\nunder two heads; arguments ‘from below’, which start from\na posteriori religious experience, and arguments ‘from\nabove’, which start from a priori philosophical\nabstraction. \nFollowing the first type of argument, pantheistic belief arises when\nthe things of this world excite a particular sort of religious reaction\nin us. We feel, perhaps, a deep reverence for and sense of\nidentity with the world in which we find ourselves.\nEpistemically it seems to us that God is not distant but can be\nencountered directly in what we experience around us. We see God in\neverything. The initial focus of attention here may be either our\nphysical environment (the land on which we live, our natural\nenvironment) or else our social environment (our community, our tribe,\nour nation or, generally, the people we meet with) but further\nreflection may lead to its more universal expansion. \nIn the second kind of argument, reasoning starts from a relatively\nabstract concept whose application is taken as assured, but further\nreflection leads to the conclusion that its scope must be extended to\ninclude the whole of reality. Most typically, the concept in question\nis that of ‘God’, or ‘perfect being’, in which\ncase pantheism appears as the logical terminus or completion of theism.\nThe following paragraphs illustrate four examples of such\nreasoning. \n(1) Traditional theism asserts the omnipresence of God and,\nwhile it strongly wishes to maintain that this is not equivalent to\npantheism, the difference between saying that God is present\neverywhere in everything and saying that God is\neverything is far from easy to explain. If omnipresence means, not\nsimply that God is cognisant of or active in all places, but literally\nthat he exists everywhere, then it is hard to see how any finite being\ncan be said to have existence external to God. Indeed, for Isaac Newton\nand Samuel Clarke divine omnipresence was one and the same thing as\nspace, which they understood as ‘the sensorium of God.’\n(Oakes 2006) \n(2) The traditional theistic position that God’s creation of the\nuniverse is continuous can easily be developed in pantheistic\ndirections. The view that the world could not exist—even for a\nsecond—without God, makes it wholly dependent on God and,\nhence, not really an autonomous entity. (Oakes 1983) Moreover, to\nfurther develop this argument, if God creates every temporal stage of\nevery object in the universe, this undermines the causal power of\nindividual things and leads to occasionalism, which in turn encourages\npantheism; for in so far as independent agency is a clear mark of\nindependent being, the occasionalist doctrine that all genuine agency\nis divine—that it all comes from a single place—tends\nto undermine the distinction of things from God. Both Malebranche and\nJonathan Edwards have found themselves charged with pantheism on these\ngrounds, and it was for this reason that Leibniz, in attempting to\nrefute the pantheistic monism of Spinoza, felt it most important to\nassert the autonomous agency of finite beings. \n(3) Alternatively it might be argued that God’s\nomniscience is indistinguishable from reality itself. For if\nthere obtains a complete mapping between God’s knowledge and the\nworld that God knows, what basis can be found for distinguishing\nbetween them, there being not even the possibility of a mismatch?\nMoreover, were we to separate the two, since knowledge tracks reality\n– we know something because it is the case and not vice versa\n– then God would become problematically dependent upon\nthe world. (Mander 2000) \n(4) Arguments of this general type may also proceed from starting\npoints more philosophical than theological. For example, Spinoza, the\nmost famous of all modern pantheists starts from the necessary\nexistence of something he calls ‘substance.’ By this he\nmeans that which exists wholly in its own right, that whose existence\ndoes not depend upon anything else. The notion of ‘the\nAbsolute’, or wholly unconditioned reality, as it figures in the\nphilosophies of Schelling, Hegel, and the British Idealists may be\nconsidered a related development of the same philosophical starting\npoint. In both cases the reasoning runs that this necessary being must\nbe all-inclusive and, hence, divine. \n\nThe pantheist asserts an identity between God and nature, but it\nneeds to be asked in just what sense we are to understand the term\n‘identity’? To begin with it is necessary to raise two\nambiguities in the logic of identity. \n(1) Dialectical identity. It is important to note that many\npantheists will not accept the classical logic of identity in which\npairs are straightforwardly either identical or different. They may\nadopt rather the logic of relative identity, or identity-in-difference,\nby which it is possible to maintain that God and the cosmos are\nsimultaneously both identical and different, or to put the matter in\nmore theological language, that God is simultaneously both transcendent\nand immanent. For example, Eriugena holds that the universe may be\nsubdivided into four categories: things which create but are not\ncreated, things which create and are created, things which are created\nbut do not create, and things which neither create nor are created. He\nargues that all four reduce to God, and hence “that God is in all\nthings, i.e. that he subsists as their essence. For He alone by Himself\ntruly has being, and He alone is everything which is truly said to be\nin things endowed with being” (Periphyseon, 97). But\nnonetheless, for Eriugena, the uncreated retains its distinct status\nseparate from the created, not least in that the former may be\nunderstood while the later transcends all understanding. In\nconsequence, he insists that God is not the genus of which creatures\nare the species. Similarly, the Sufi philosopher, ibn ‘Arabi\nidentifies God and the universe, suggesting in a striking metaphor that\nthe universe is the food of God and God the food of the universe; as\ndeity swallows up the cosmos so the cosmos swallows up deity.\n(Bezels of Wisdom, 237; Husaini 1970, 180) But Ibn\n‘Arabi in no sense regards such claims as preventing him from\ninsisting also on the fundamental gulf between the unknowable essence\nof God and his manifest being. We must distinguish between the nature\nof God and the nature of things, between that which exists by itself\n(God) and that which exist by another (the universe), but since the\nnature of God just is Being itself, no parallel distinction may be\ndrawn between the being of God and the being of things. Nothing real\nexists besides God who discloses himself in and through the universe.\n(Chittick 1989, ch.5) Again, Nicholas of Cusa’s celebrated\ndoctrine of the ‘coincidence of opposites’—which he\nmemorably illustrated by pointing to way in which, upon infinite\nexpansion, a circle must coincide with a straight line—allows\nhim to say both that God and the creation are the same thing\nand that there exists a fundamental distinction between the\nrealm of absolute being and the realm of limited or contracted being.\n(Moran 1990) Even Spinoza goes to great lengths to show that the two\nattributes of thought and extension by which we pick\nout the one substance as ‘God’ or ‘nature’ are\nnonetheless at the same time irreducibly different. They may be\nco-referring but they are not synonymous; indeed, they are utterly\nincommensurable. Such a dialectical conception of unity, in which there\ncan be no identity without difference, is a strong element in\nHegel’s thought, and also one aspect of what Hartshorne meant by\ndipolar theism; the opposites of immanence and transcendence\nare included among those which he thinks God brings together in his\nbeing. \n(2) Partial Identity. Even accepting a classical conception of\nidentity and difference, there remain issues to settle. If we think of\npantheism negatively as a rejection of the view that God is distinct\nfrom the cosmos, we would face four possible schemes by which we might\nrepresent their merelogical relation: we might understand God as proper\npart of nature, we might take nature as a proper part of God, we might\nregard the two domains as partially overlapping, or else we might hold\nthat they are strictly identical. \nReflecting upon the ambiguities of the previous two paragraphs, it\nmight be argued that only where we find strict classical identity do we\nhave pantheism. For if the universe is not wholly divine we have mere\nimmanentism, while if God includes but is not exhausted by the\nuniverse then we have rather panentheism. Now, certainly it\nmay be allowed there are metaphysical schemes for which the range of\noverlap between divinity and the cosmos is so small that they fail to\ncapture the spirit of pantheism. (For example, a world-view in which\nGod were understood as the vital spark which animates an otherwise dead\nand motionless cosmos, or a world-view in which the cosmos were merely\none small fraction of the being of God would indeed seem far from the\nspirit of pantheism.) However, to limit the term’s application to\njust those schemes advancing strict classical identity would be far too\nrestrictive. \nSuch ‘strict identity’ is virtually impossible to\ndefine due to the extreme difficulty of stipulating what would count as\nan acceptable and what as an unacceptable sense, part, aspect, or\nelement of difference. For example, Aquinas distinguishes between\nthe doctrine that God is the form of all things (‘formal\npantheism’) and the doctrine that God is the matter of all things\n(‘material pantheism’) (Moran 1989, 86). Does either of\nthese count as pantheism ‘proper’, or must both obtain at\nthe same time? Again, while some pantheists conceive of deity in\nmereological terms as the collection of things which make up the\nuniverse, many others have found this approach inadequate, maintaining\nthat in some important sense ‘the whole is greater than the sum\nof its parts.’ The finite things that we encounter around us and\nare happy enough to describe as parts of nature we feel less\nhappy to think of as parts of God. Such theorists may also\nreject the charge that their way of thinking is panentheistic,\nmaintaining that the proper lesson to draw is not one of the\ntranscendence of the holistic view but rather one concerning the degree\nof unreality or abstraction involved in any distributed view. In short,\ndoes any admission of difference between the world as\ncommon-sense experiences it and the divine cosmos as pantheism\nunderstands it amount to a concession either that there are aspects of\nexperience which fall outside deity or aspects of deity which fall\noutside experience? If so, then the class of ‘true\npantheists’ threatens to become null. In the end, rather than\nattempt to draw sharp but artificial and contentious lines it seems\nmore fruitful to maintain that the boundaries of demarcation between\nimmanence, pantheism, and panentheism are vague and porous. \nThis approach has the further advantage of keeping together\nhistorically cognate thinkers. If the essence of pantheism lies in\nstrict classical identity, the issue of who is or is not a pantheist\ncomes down to the somewhat arcane dispute whether there could be any\nconceivable aspect or side of reality which was not natural, and/or\nwhether there could be any conceivable aspect or side of reality which\nwas not divine, but these are abstruse points that can only take us\naway from the fundamental pantheistic intuition of the overlap of God\nand nature, the intuition that that in grasping the reality before us\nwe grasp God himself, not something separate or intermediary. \n\nTo say that God is identical with the world as a whole is\nnot self-explanatory and, although often the matter is left\ndisconcertingly vague, examination of the literature reveals a variety\nof different understandings of the identity relation being asserted\nhere. \n(1) Substance identity. For Spinoza the claim that God is the\nsame as the cosmos is spelled out as the thesis that there exists one\nand only one particular substance which he refers to as ‘God or\nnature’; the individual thing referred to as ‘God’ is\none and the same object as the complex unit referred to as\n‘nature’ or ‘the cosmos.’ On such a scheme the\nfinite things of the world are thought of as something like\nparts of the one great substance, although the terminology of\nparts is somewhat problematic. Parts are relatively autonomous from the\nwhole and from each other, and Spinoza’s preferred terminology of\nmodes, which are to be understood as more like properties, is\nchosen to rectify this. A further problem with the terminology of parts\nis that many pantheists have wanted to claim that God or nature is not\njust the whole or totality of things, but is somehow the inner essence\nor heart of each individual thing. This may be expressed in\nthe idea that somehow the whole is present in each of its parts, a\nsuggestion whose meaning has often been left metaphorical or obscure.\nGiordano Bruno, for example employs the two illustrations of a voice\nheard in its entirety from all sides of the room, and that of a large\nmirror which reflects one image of one thing but which, if it is\nbroken into a thousand pieces, each of the pieces still reflects the\nwhole image. (Bruno 1584, 50, 129) A thesis of the complete\ninterpenetration or interrelation of everything, the claim being made\nhere is related to that defended by Leibniz (who was not a pantheist)\nthat each monad is a mirror to the entire universe. \nIn Western philosophy Spinoza’s formulation of the pantheistic\nposition has become so influential as to almost complete define the\nposition, but while practically all pantheists are monists (of some\nsort), not all are substance monists, and there do exist\nalternative ways of expressing identity besides a head-count of the\nnumber of particular entities. \n(2) Being itself. There is a long theological tradition in\nwhich God is regarded as being itself, rather than as one\nbeing among others, and insofar as it treats God as something to be\nfound inseparable from and at the very root of all that is, such a\nconception may be used to express pantheism. While a conceptual\ndistinction may be drawn between ‘the totality of beings’\nand ‘being itself,’ it is clear that neither of these could\nhave any reality except in and through the other. The identification of\nGod with being itself is a common Christian view, from Augustine to\nTillich, but it is not exclusive to Christian thought. For example, Ibn\n‘Arabi, in developing the Koranic notion of tawhīd\n(God’s unity), asserts that there can be no real being other than\nGod; that God permeates through all beings and is essentially\nall things. Especially among his followers this was developed into a\nmonistic ontology of wahdat al-wujūd (the unity of\nbeing). \n(3) Identity of origin. A third way to express the identity of\nGod and nature is by reference to the thought that all things come from\nGod, rendering them both identical with each other and with the one\nsource from which they came. It is important in this connection to\ndiscuss the difference between such notions as emanation, expression,\nor instantiation and the more specifically theistic conception of\ncreation ex nihilo, for given the plausibility of supposing\nthat what ‘flows forth’ or ‘radiates out’ from\na source is only latent within that stem, traditional theists have\noften insisted on creation ex nihilo precisely to drive a\nwedge between creator and created and thereby rule out pantheism. But\nalthough it would be tempting to contrast creation ex nihio as\ntheistic and emanation as pantheistic, such thoughts are probably too\nsimple. Plotinus’ universe comprises in a hierarchy of emanations\nfrom what he terms, the ‘One’; but as neither anything in\nthe cosmos nor the sum of all things in the cosmos, as an ideal\nconstruction from which all expressions fall short, Plotinus’ God\nis really too transcendent for his doctrine to count as pantheism\nproper. Eriugena, by contrast, has an emanation-theory that is more\ngenuinely pantheist but, given his apophatic conception of God as\nmarked by both being and non-being, he regards this position as wholly\ncompatible with the doctrine of creation ex nihilo. To\nEriugena, God is precisely the nothing from which all things were made.\nSpinoza approaches the question of origin from a rather different\nangle. Arguing that God is the immanent cause of all things, he draws\nan important distinction between natura naturans and\nnatura naturata; between the universe considered in active\nmode as cause and the very same universe considered in passive mode as\neffect (Ethics 1p29s). This is an important doctrine not least\nfor the way in which it links with necessity. Modelled more on the way\nin which the theorems of geometry derive from its axioms than on the\nsense in which a work of art results from the free or spontaneous\nactivity of its artist, pantheistic creation of this second type courts\na determinism that threatens to rule out free will. And that has\nbeen a very common objection to pantheism. \n(4) Teleological Identity. Religious world views in which it\nis the ultimate destiny or purpose of the cosmos to achieve oneness\nwith or to fully express deity provide a fourth model for understanding\npantheistic claims of identity. The true identity of the universe is\nthat which is revealed at the end of all things. For example, on the\nAbsolute Idealist scheme, history culminates in the complete\nrealization of God or Absolute spirit in the world and so, as Schelling\nput it, in the last days “God will indeed be all in all,\nand pantheism will be true” (Schelling 1810, 484). A rather\ndifferent example of this type of thinking is that of Samuel Alexander\nwho thinks that the universe evolves in a steadily progressive manner\nand will finally ‘attain deity’, where deity is thought of\nas an unknown but superior quality that will ‘emerge’ from\nthe complex whole in rather the same way as, at a lower level,\nconsciousness ‘emerges’ from complex organisations of\norganic matter. By way of objection to such teleological conception of\nidentity it might be challenged that something can only become merged\nwith God, or become God, if it is now different from God. But\nagainst this it could be replied that, if the notion of teleology be\ntaken seriously, a thing more truly is what it is destined to\nbecome than what it currently seems to be, for everything\nabout it is to be explained in terms of its telos or goal. It\nmay also be responded that anything which can be converted\ninto God cannot be finally different from God. Hence\nAlexander, for example, is clear that since all potentiality must be\ngrounded in some actuality there is also a sense in which the universe\nis already implicitly God: “God as actually possessing deity does\nnot exist but is an ideal, is always becoming; but God as the whole\nuniverse tending towards deity does exist” (Alexander 1921,\n428). \n\nAt least as usually understood the two terms ‘nature’\nand ‘God’ have different and contrasting meanings. If they\nare identified, it follows that one or both words are being used in a\ndifferent way than usual; that nature is more like God than commonly\nthought and/or that God is more like nature than commonly thought. With\nrespect to the cosmos this may be seen in the stress pantheists\ntypically put on the unity of the cosmos. \nA distinction may be drawn between distributive pantheism, the\nview that each thing in the cosmos is divine, and collective\npantheism, the view that the cosmos as a whole is divine. (Oppy,\n1994) And if polytheism in general is coherent there is no reason in\nprinciple why we should exclude the possibility of a distributive\npantheism. But as in pursuit of explanatory unity and coherence belief\nin many Gods tends historically to give way to belief in single deity,\nwhile it would be technically possible to identify the universe with a\ncollection of deities, in practice monism tends to win out, and it has\nbeen characteristic of pantheists to stress heavily the unity of\nnature. Thus pantheism typically asserts a two-fold identity:\nas well as the unity of God and nature, it urges the unity of all\nthings with each other. \nIt may be asked whether a statement of the world’s unity is a\nprecondition for asserting its identity with God, or a\nconsequence of asserting it? Is the intuition that the cosmos\nconstitutes a single integrated whole a contributory factor in thinking\nit divine, or (reflecting the traditional idea that God is unique and\nsimple or without parts) is the intuition that it is divine the reason\nfor regarding it as such a unity? \nThe kind of unity which the pantheist thinks to find in nature can vary\nfrom a very strong metaphysical oneness, like that of Parmenides, which\nexcludes all diversity or difference, to a much looser systematic\ncomplex of distinct but inter-related elements, but the four species of\nunity most commonly defended are: (1) the unity of all that falls\nwithin the spatio-temporal continuum under a common set of physical\nlaws, (2) the reductive unity of a single material out of which all\nobjects are made and within which no non-arbitrary divisions can be\nmade, (3) the unity of a living organism, or (4) the more psychological\nunity of a spirit, mind or person. \n\nBesides commitment to the view that the cosmos as a whole is divine,\npantheists as a general class hold no specific theory about the\nnature of that cosmos. There are three main traditions. \n(1) Physicalism. Many pantheists argue that physical\nconceptions are adequate to explain the entire cosmos. This is an\nancient form of pantheism, found for example in the Stoics, for whom\nonly bodies can be said to exist. Soul they understood as nothing more\nthan a specific form of pneuma, or breath, the active power to\nbe found throughout nature. This is also a form of pantheism popular\ntoday—often termed, scientific or naturalistic pantheism. Such\nworldviews make no ontological commitments beyond those sanctioned by\nempirical science. \n(2) Idealism. During the nineteenth century, when pantheism\nwas at its most popular, the dominant form was idealist. According to\nAbsolute Idealism, as defended by such figures as Fichte, Schelling,\nHegel, and many of the British Idealists, all that exists is a single\nspiritual entity, of which the physical world must be understood as a\npartial manifestation. The search for that which may be asserted\nwithout condition or qualification leads to the conclusion that all\nvariety is the expression of an underlying unity, and that nothing can\nbe real in the absence of mind or spirit. On some versions of this sort\nof doctrine the physical world starts to look more like an\nappearance of the ultimate spiritual (or possibly unknown)\nreality beneath. Hegel himself rejects this sort of doctrine\n—which he terms acosmism—and while it certainly\namounts to a view that there exists nothing besides God, in view of its\nbasic denial of the reality of the world we all experience it hardly\nseems like a kind of pantheism. \n(3) Dual-aspect theory. The pantheism of Spinoza is of neither\nthese types. For Spinoza, there is one thing which expresses itself, or\nwhich may be understood, in two different ways, either as thinking\nsubstance or as extended substance. The principle difficulty of any\nsuch position is to further specify that ambiguous relationship, whilst\nsimultaneously avoiding the twin but opposed pitfalls of reductionism\nand dualism. \nPantheists holds that whatever exists falls within God. This places\nthem in disagreement with any theory of the supernatural. But\nsuch opposition must not be misunderstood, for to say that there is no\nsupernatural realm is not in itself to delineate the range of what is\nnatural. This is important, for while many contemporary pantheists have\nbeen epistemologically conservative, there is no reason in\nprinciple why the pantheist should oppose the idea of that which\nis epistemically transcendent to us, no reason (that is) why he should\nseek to limit the compass of the universe to the known\nuniverse. For example, Spinoza held, not only that the realms of\nthought and extension must stretch indefinitely beyond our finite\ngrasp, but that, as well as in the two known realms of thought and\nextension, the one substance must exist also in an infinity of other\ndimensions completely beyond our power to conceive. \n\nOne of the strongest and most commonly raised objections to\npantheism is that it is simply inappropriate to call the universe\n‘God’. Thus Schopenhauer complains that “Pantheism is\nonly a euphemism for atheism,” for “to call the world God\nis not to explain it; it is only to enrich our language with a\nsuperfluous synonym for the word world” (Schopenhauer 1851,\nI:114, II:99). It has been described as nothing more than\n‘materialism grown sentimental,’ (Illingworth 1898, 69)\nwhile more recently Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion\ncomplains that “Pantheism is sexed-up Atheism” (Dawkins\n2007, 40). It is clear that the more naturalistically the cosmos is\nconceived the stronger that objection must seem, but to estimate more\ncarefully its validity the following six sections take in turn a number\nof characteristics which the cosmos possesses or might possess and\nwhich could be thought to make it divine. We may proceed from the least\nto the most contested, noting that not all pantheists will agree on all\nmarks. \n\nMost straightforwardly it has been maintained that the One is holy\nbecause we feel a particular set of religious emotions towards it.\n(Levine 1994, ch.2.2) For Rudolf Otto, (1917) whatever is holy or\n‘numinous’ is so characterised on the basis of our\nnon-rational, non-sensory experience of it rather than its own\nobjective features and, taking its departure from Otto’s work,\none approach has been to argue that the feelings of awe which people\nfeel towards God can be, and often are, applied to the universe itself.\nWhether it is really possible, or appropriate, to entertain such\nfeelings towards the cosmos as a whole will be discussed below, but the\nchief point to make here concerns the extreme subjectivism of this\nresponse; it’s coming to rest upon feelings which, while sincere\nenough, indicate nothing whatsoever about the universe itself. On this\nview, all that distinguishes a pantheist from an atheist is\nfeeling; a certain emotional reaction or connection that we\nfeel to the universe. It would become akin, say, to the difference\nbetween one who loves art and another who is relatively indifferent to\nit. Prima facie, however, this approach puts the cart before\nthe horse; rather than say that the One is divine because we feel a set\nof religious emotions towards it, it seems more appropriate to suppose\nthat we feel those emotions towards it because we think it is\ndivine. \n\nReligion gives meaning to human lives by assigning them a certain\ndefinite place within a grander scheme or narrative. It gives its\nadherents a sense of their part in a coherent universe. It tells us\nthat the universe is not a random conjunction of brute facts, but a\nwhole in which we have our proper location. The pantheist may regard\nthe cosmos as divine for very similar reasons. To think of oneself as\npart of a vast interconnected scheme may give one a sense of being\n‘at home in the universe.’ Here ecological thinking\nmay come to the fore; like the individual creatures in a complex\necosystem, small but vital contributors to a larger whole, we too may\nbe thought to have our place in the connected whole that is Nature. \n\nHistorically the majority of pantheists have regarded the universe\nas Infinite, metaphysically perfect, necessarily existent, and eternal\n(or some subset thereof) and—taking these attributes as the\ncharacteristic marks of divinity—that has formed one very\nimportant reason for thinking that the universe itself is in fact\nGod. \nIn more recent times, however, there have arisen naturalistic or\nscientific forms of pantheism which reject or are neutral about these\ncharacteristics and, while they remove one important set of reasons for\nthinking the cosmos divine, so long as others remain, the amputation in\nitself seems insufficient reason to refuse the label\n‘pantheist’ to such views. Any methodology which limits\nitself to empirical science will presumably find it hard to attribute\nanything like infinitude or necessary existence to the cosmos, while\napproaches which do find a role for such features will need to be\ncareful that they understand them in an appropriate fashion. (For\nexample, it is doubtful that mere infinite extent, or infinite\ndivisibility, in space and time would be sufficient to merit that the\nuniverse be called divine.) But with these caveats aside the pantheist\nis not without arguments for believing that the universe as a whole\ndisplays marks of metaphysical perfection. \nThe earliest arguments for such a view are to be found in the\npre-Socratic philosopher Anaximander who held that the universe emerges\nfrom what he termed ‘to apeiron,’ a complex notion\nwhich may be rendered as the infinite, the boundless or the indefinite.\nAnaximander’s thought seems to have been that the ground by which\nall qualitative characteristics are explained must itself lack any\ndetermination. Insofar as we can construct his reasons, he argued that\nsome such boundless potentiality was need to ensure the continual\ncoming to be and passing away in the world that characterises the\npassing of time. As something thus immortal and indestructible,\nAnaximander concluded that the infinite was also divine. (Aristotle,\nPhysics, 203b) \nIt is notable that much of the same reasoning that theists employ in\nthe Kalaam cosmological argument for the existence of God may be used\nfor the universe itself. If we inquire into the origin of the universe,\nit may be suggested (1) that it simply began without reason, (2) that\nit was somehow self-creating, or (3) that its origin requires a prior\ncause which in turn calls for an infinite causal chain. Each of these\nanswers has sufficient problems such that one might well prefer to\nargue instead, (4) that the universe in fact exists necessarily. \nBut perhaps the most commonly used argument among pantheists has been\nthe ontological argument. As employed by classical theism this line of\nargument has been much criticised, but the forms in which it has been\nput forward by pantheists (such as Spinoza and Hegel) are interestingly\ndifferent. On their way of thinking, the more perfect an idea becomes\nthe less room there remains for any gap between it and its\ninstantiation, but no idea becomes perfect simply by defining itself to\nbe so. This can be shown only by a full development of its content\namounting to nothing less than a complete philosophical system.\n(Harrelson 2009) \n\nA fourth feature commonly taken to mark the divinity of God is his\nineffability. If he is so much greater than anything else, anything we\nsay of him would limit or falsify him, so we can speak at best in\nnegatives, or simply conclude that he is an ineffable mystery. It would\nbe hard to think of a line of reasoning less congenial to the\nrationalist spirit that has characterised many pantheists, for example\nscientific pantheism. \nAt the same time it must be allowed that there is a strong apophatic\nstreak in much pantheism. In contrast to his teacher, Thales, who\nthought it possible to specify the ground of all things as water, for\nAnaximander the one source from which cosmos comes forth (to\napeiron) is construed precisely in terms of its resistance to any\ndeterminate characterisation, while both Eriugena and Ibn ‘Arabi\nstress that although the God of which we can speak is identical with\nthe cosmos, there remains another sense in which we cannot speak of God\nat all. The essence of God considered in himself, the universal ground\nof being cannot itself be captured by any of the limited categories\nwhich flow out from it. Even Spinoza suggests that the highest stages\nof knowledge consist in a form of intuitive insight, which transcends\nmere reasoning or conceptual knowledge in that it enables us to grasp\nthe essence of individual things. Part of what he calls ‘the\nintellectual love of God’, such scientia intuitiva is\nitself assigned a salvific role in Spinoza’s thought; it is the\npath to human blessedness. \n\nEinstein was a pantheist but rejected any notion of a personal God.\n(Einstein 2010, 325) And like Einstein, for many pantheists rejection\nof a personal deity is the definitive mark or most important element of\ntheir position. (Levine 1994; Harrison 2004) However, the matter calls\nfor more considered attention.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the specific question of whether\nGod is literally a ‘person’ and the more general question\nwhether God is ‘person-like’; the issue of whether\nnotions such as intellect, thought, consciousness, intent, etc. have\nany application to the divine, even if analogical or metaphorical. It\nshould also be recognised both that the notion of personhood is itself\ndeeply problematic, and that a not inconsiderable number of traditional\ntheists would only with considerable qualification be prepared\nto allow that God is personal. \nThese points made, while it is true that traditional theism has\nregularly opposed pantheism on the grounds that it tends to be\nimpersonal, and true also that many pantheists would deny that God is\npersonal, it is nonetheless the case that many other pantheists have\nthought mind-like attribution of some form or other to the cosmos\nabsolutely central to their position. \nIt is clear that pantheistic systems which start from the theistic God\nwhich they then find to be all-inclusive, or Absolute Idealist systems\nwhich derive all reality from a spiritual principle, will find it\neasier to attribute something like personhood to the cosmos than will\nthose which are more naturalistically motivated. But it is important to\nrealise that not even the latter are wholly resistant to\npersonhood. \nFor example, it has been argued (Baltzly 2003) that the Stoics believed\nin a personal deity. Just as they construed human beings as physical\ncreatures animated by a physical soul, so too they regarded God as the\nmind of the world—with the cosmos as his body. Like a vast\nbiological individual, to them God was a conscious rational being,\nexercising providence over life and to whom we might approach in\nprayer. \nSpinoza’s God is an “infinite intellect”,\n(Ethics 2p11c) all knowing, (2p3) and capable of loving both\nhimself—and us, insofar as we are part of his perfection.\n(5p35c) And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards\nwhich we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that\nSpinoza recommends amor intellectualist dei (the intellectual\nlove of God) as the supreme good for man. (5p33) However, the matter is\ncomplex. Spinoza’s God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does\nnot have purposes or intentions (1appendix), and Spinoza insists that\n“neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God”\n(1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God\nis really not the kind of being who could ever love us back. “He\nwho loves God cannot strive that God should love him in\nreturn,” says Spinoza (5p19). \nAnother notable pantheist to insist that the supreme being is personal\nwas Gustav Fechner, who develops a form of panpsychism according to\nwhich all organised matter must be thought of as possessing its own\ninner life or soul. The more complex and developed its structure, the\nmore sophisticated its spiritual life; from the lowest soul-life of\nplants, through our own mental life, which is just the inner side of\nour bodies, through the soul-life of the planets and stars up to the\nmost developed spirit of all, God, the consciousness which corresponds\nto the most complex organism there is, the cosmos itself. More\nrecently, a very similar view has been put forward by Timothy Sprigge\nwho maintains that that the only conceivable form of reality consists\nin streams of experience, such as we know ourselves to be, all of which\nmust be thought of as included together within a single all-embracing\nexperience; which we may call God or the Absolute. Sprigge, however, is\nmore cautious than Fechner insofar as he declines to identify any\nphysical systems other than those of animals (including human beings)\nthat can confidently be said to possess their own inner conscious life.\n(Sprigge 2006, ch.9) Against the idea that God is some type of\nall-embracing spirit or person it is often complained that this would\nundermine the autonomous personhood of finite individuals; for can one\nperson be part of another? Fechner suggests as a model for\nunderstanding this the way in which our different sense modalities\n(sight, smell, touch, etc), each inaccessible to each other, combine\ntogether into one unified consciousness. (Fechner 1946, 144) While to\nextend such a model beyond the merely receptive to the active aspects\nof personhood, we might think of the way in which the agency of an\norganisation is exercised through the agency of its individual members.\nHere several pantheists have been influenced by Christian ideas of the\nindwelling spirit of God at work within the body of the Church. \n\nSixthly (and perhaps most importantly of all) it is widely thought\nthat the most important thing about God—thing that most makes\nus call him ‘God’—is his perfection or goodness.\nGod is a being ‘worthy of worship.’ Can the pantheist say\nthis of the cosmos as a whole? A variety of positions are possible. (1)\nAny pantheistic world-view arrived at by extending the reach of the\ntraditional theistic God will find it relatively easy to assert the\nsame value to the cosmos that it attributed to God, but there are other\npossibilities as well. (2) Insofar as the pantheist assertion of unity\nmay be understood as an assertion of complete and coherent integration,\nand disvalue held to lie in conflict, disharmony or incompleteness,\nthen it may be possible to argue that the culmination of metaphysical\nunity constitutes also the culmination of value. For example, the\nAbsolute Idealist Bernard Bosanquet states, “We cannot describe\nperfection; that is, we cannot enumerate its components and state their\nform and connection in detail. But we can define its character as the\nharmony of all being. And good is perfection in its character of\nsatisfactoriness; that which is considered as the end of conations and\nthe fruition of desires” (Bosanquet 1913,194). (3) More\nnaturalistically, it might be suggested than pantheism tells us that\nnature is our proper home and, as such, our proper good. Everything has\nits place in a wider system which both supports it and to which it\ncontributes. As natural creatures our most fulfilling life is found in\nand at one with nature. (4) Lastly, it should be noted that many\nscientific pantheists argue that nature has no intrinsic value\nwhatsoever. It is merely something that we happen to love and\nvenerate in the highest degree. \nHistorically one of the strongest and most persistent objections to\npantheism is that, because of its all-encompassing nature, it seems\ninhospitable to the differentiations of value that characterise life.\nIn what might be thought of as a pantheistic version of the problem of\nevil, it is challenged that if God includes everything and God is\nperfect or good, then everything which exists ought to be perfect or\ngood; a conclusion which seems wholly counter to our common experience\nthat much in the world is very far from being so. Or to put the\nargument slightly differently, if whatever we do or however things turn\nout must be deemed the action of God, how can our pantheistic belief\ndemand of us any specific duty? The only alternative conclusion, if we\nwish to hold on to the difference between what is good and what is bad,\nwould seem to be equally unattractive claim that a universe\ncontaining both values, in itself possesses\nneither; the pantheistic deity in its own being lies beyond\ngood and evil. \nTo point out that classical theism faces its own difficulties over evil\nand God’s providence, while it may level the playing field, does\nnothing in itself to help solve the puzzle, and pantheists themselves\nhave suggested a variety of explanations or theodicies. (1) The most\npopular model for dealing with evil is found in the philosophy of\nSpinoza who regards both error and evil as distortions that result from\nthe fragmentary view of finite creatures; phenomena real enough to the\nfinite beings who experience them but which would disappear in the\nwidest and final vision of God. In this he was, of course, developing\nthe Stoic sense that if we could see the world as God does, as the\nperfectly harmonious embodiment of the logos, we would\nrecognise how its apparent defects in fact contribute to the goodness\nof the whole. (2) It may be responded also that the objection that\npantheism councils moral indifference is based on a modal confusion,\ncomparable to that made by the proponent of logical determinism. If\npantheism amounts to a doctrine of providence, it is true that what\nactually happens will be for the best, but it certainly does not follow\nfrom that that whatever else might have happened would\nhave been for the best, and it possible that part at least of the\nperfection of the cosmos comes about through our own individual moral\nchoices. \n\nAlthough not all pantheists ascribe intrinsic value to the cosmos as\na whole, insofar as they do, that might be thought give rise to\nsomething of a puzzle. For if God is valuable and God is identical to\nthe universe then we might seem committed to the somewhat implausible\nthought that everything in the universe is equally valuable; a\nleveling off which gave rise to Coleridge’s complaint that\n‘everything God’ and ‘no God’ are in effect\nidentical positions. (Coleridge 1839, 224) The pantheist need not be\ncommitted to this view, however, for the fact that a certain feature or\nelement is present in everything by no means entails that it is\nequally present in everything. Although the universe as a\nwhole may be divine, there is no need to regard each bit of it as\nuniformly divine; no need (for example) to feel quite the same about\nthe loss of biological species as we do about the disappearance of\nhuman cultures and languages. Historically, there have been two main\nways in which pantheists have regarded the distribution of value in the\nuniverse. \n(1) Emphasis on nature. Most typically pantheism is\ncharacterized by deep love and reverence for the natural world insofar\nas it exists independently of human culture or civilization. The\npantheist finds God more in the waterfall or the rainforest than in the\ncar park or the gasworks. From the romantic period onwards this is a\nvery strong drive in both literary and popular pantheism, with urban\nand technological life regarded as at best a kind of self-interested\nanthropocentric distortion of true value and at worst even a kind of\nloss or separation from divinity. \nIf uncultivated nature is divine then the pantheist may\nlegitimately conclude that it should be treated with respect, even as\nsacred. Such is the import of Aldo Leopold’s ‘land\nethic’ (1949) or the ‘deep ecology’ of Arne Næss,\n(1973) and many modern pantheists have developed close connections with\nenvironmentalism. But neither the import nor the justification of such\nideas are straightforward. It might be suggested that as no one person\nought to put their own interests before another, neither ought any\nspecies to put itself ahead of another, nor the sentient ahead of the\ninsentient, nor the living ahead of the non-living. But with each\nfurther step this argument becomes harder to press, due to the extreme\ndifficulty of identifying—and weighing—such potentially\nconflicting interests. For example, unless the pantheist is some sort\nof panpsychist, he will not regard natural objects such as rivers or\nmountains as possessing sentience, purpose or interests of its own;\nwhich means that treating them with respect cannot be modelled on what\nit means to treat people or animals with respect. \n(2) Emphasis on humanity. A second and very different model\nfor understanding the relationship between divinity and value\nmaintains that God is most revealed in human culture and history. For\nthe Stoics, Reason or logos—the essence of the\nworld—though it underlies all things, is more strongly manifest\nin some (such as human life) than in others, while the virtues of\nstoic detachment and self-sufficiency preclude our true good being\nheld hostage to the state of anything external to ourselves, such as\nnature. This pair of attitudes is summed up in Cicero’s\nnotorious assertion that all things were made for either Gods or\nmen. (Holland 1997, Baltzly 2003) But probably the best illustration\nof this more anthropocentric way of thinking about value is the\nHegelian system, in which Geist —the spirit whose\nmanifestation is the universe—articulates itself in a\ndevelopmental sequence of increasingly adequate expressions (which may\nor may not also be temporal) up from the most basic abstractions of\nmerely physical nature, through the organic realm, up to its apex in\nthe concrete details of social and cultural life. The beauties of\nnature are valued as an approximation to those of art, and the\ndevelopment of ethical life (Sittlichkeit) is literally\n“the march of God in the world” (Hegel 1821, 247). \n\nIf, as we have suggested, there is room for value in pantheism then\nthere is room for ethics. But does pantheism prescribe any specific\nethics? There are two respects in which pantheism might be thought to\nhave significant ethical implications. \nFirstly, for pantheism, there is no higher power, no external authority\nto tell us what to do. Insofar as it rejects any sense of a\ntranscendent external lawgiver or—to put the matter more\npositively—insofar as it regards deity as the distributed\npossession of all, pantheism may be represented as endorsing the\nKantian doctrine of the autonomy of ethical judgement. But the\nimplications of this are open. It can lead to either democratic\ncommunitarian ethics or to individualism. Paradoxically, it might\nequally well result in a species of conservative conformity to whatever\nis deemed to be the ‘natural state’ of the world every bit\nas stifling to the human spirit as conformity to whatever is deemed to\nbe ‘the will of God.’ \nSecondly, it may be argued that pantheism is able to give a\nparticularly strong ground for an ethic of altruism or compassion. To\nSchopenhauer (with whom this argument is particularly associated) only\ngenuinely altruistic or compassion actions have moral worth, but only\npleasure and pain are capable of motivating the will, from which he\nconcludes that genuinely moral action is possible only if the pleasure\nand pain of others can stir us to action as directly and immediately as\ncan our own pleasure and pain. It is not enough that we sympathetically\nimagine ourselves in their shoes, he argues, we must literally feel the\npleasure and pain of others as our own, an attitude that will be\nrationally grounded only in a monistic metaphysics in which the\ndistinction between ego and not ego becomes a trivial or illusory one\nbetween two manifestations of the same underlying unity. (Schopenhauer\n1839) Schopenhauer includes nonhuman animals in this argument. To the\ncharge that what is defended here remains but a species of\negoism—metaphysically enlarged, but still morally \nworthless—it may be replied that self-concern is to be deprecated only\ninsofar as it is something that exists in contrast with concern for\nothers; a contrast which no longer finds any purchase in this\nscheme. \n\nReligion is a form of life, not a philosophical theory. Thus theism\nis not itself a religion, although it lies at the core of many\nreligions, and neither is pantheism itself a religion, although a core\nof pantheistic belief has unquestionably grounded the religion of many\npeople. \nNo doubt many pantheists self-consciously and deliberately reject\ntheism, while many theists strongly reject pantheism. But to conclude\nfrom this that pantheism should be understood as essentially\nopposed to theism would seem precipitous (like concluding mutual\nincompatibility from the fact that many Christians oppose socialism and\nmany socialists oppose Christianity). Without being drawn into\ndoctrinal questions well outside the purview of this essay, two points\nmay be made. Many philosophers who have put forward pantheist beliefs\nhave thought there was no need for anyone who accepted them to abandon\ntraditional religion (for example, Spinoza, Hegel, or Edward \nCaird—who argues that “the religious consciousness is not the\nconsciousness of another object than that which is present in finite\nexperience and science, but simply a higher way of knowing the same\nobject,” (1892, 464) but whom nonetheless considered himself\nChristian.) From the other side, many committed theologians have\nadvanced positions with deeply pantheistic implications (e.g. the\n‘Christian Pantheism’ of Teilhard de Chardin or the\n‘Ethical Pantheism’ of Albert Schweitzer.) \nIt is sometimes objected that pantheism cannot really be religious on\nthe grounds that it can make no sense to direct at the cosmos\nthe religious attitudes and emotions—worship, love, \ngratitude—which are more normally directed towards a person.\n(Levine 1994, 315) (This is, of course, to assume that the pantheistic\nGod is not personal; a claim which, as we have seen, many\npantheists would reject.) Worship is commonly an expression of\ndependence on a personal creator God, but, even if we don’t\napprove of their doing so, people worship many other things, such as\nmoney, fashion, the State, or idols, without necessarily assuming that\nthese have residing within them some conscious spirit or other. Love is\nmore usually felt towards people, but Wordsworth described himself as a\n‘lover of nature’ (Tintern Abbey) while Byron\nthought it possible to love his country but not his countrymen. (Byron\n1854, 25) We typically thank a person, but it is possible also to feel\ngratitude which transcends any feeling to particular individuals to an\ninstitution (such as a college, community, or even State) which has\nnurtured you. In each case there remains room for doubt whether these\nattitudes are really equivalent to the sort of emotions more typically\nassociated with religion, but equally it is hard to see on what\nlegitimate grounds emotions might excluded from consideration as\n‘not properly religious.’ \nIn most religions prayer is not simply the expression of worship, love,\nand gratitude, but an act in which we petition the deity for\nintercession. We can petition the theistic God, but can we petition the\nuniverse itself? Most pantheists have thought not, but where the cosmos\nis conceived as personal, or at least moral, room may exist to develop\nsuch ideas. Construing the entire universe as a conscious being,\nFechner argues that it makes perfect sense to petition it; the only\ndifference being that normal requests must be expressed since the\nobject to which they are directed lies outside of us, but in the case\nof God this is unnecessary since we exist already within him. (Fechner\n1946, 242–6) Even if not personal, so long as it could be said that the\nuniverse exhibits a moral narrative structure there is no reason to\ninsist that that structure be independent of the moral needs or\nrequests of creatures within it. (Mander 2007) \nA common mark of religion is its soteriological character, its\nrecognition that the human condition is somehow unsatisfactory or\n‘fallen’ and its offer to overcome this state through a\nprocess of human transformation, be the result of that renovation\nenduring happiness or some more elevated state of blessedness or\nnirvana. Can pantheism respond to this? Can it offer the\nbeliever hope for a better life? \nIf all that is hoped for is the well-being that comes from a more\nethical mode of existence, then pantheism is perfectly able to offer\nthis, supporting a value system which eschews selfishness in favour of\na wider concern. For example the American poet Robinson Jeffers\nsuggests that “there is peace, freedom, I might say a kind of\nsalvation, in turnings one’s affections outwards towards this one\nGod, rather than inwards on one’s self, or on humanity”\n(Jeffers 2009, 365) But some other pantheists have sought to offer\nsomething further. Pantheist systems with a teleological structure\n(such as those discussed in Section Four above) readily lend themselves\nto soteriology on a grand scale; for example, while to Spinoza the\nhighest state of human happiness consists in the intellectual love of\nGod (a state not dissimilar to the Beatific Vision), Hegel outlines a\ndevelopmental scheme whose climax consists in the full and explicit\nself-manifestation of God. \nIn many traditional religions salvation has been linked to immortality.\nAgainst this, it has been common among pantheists to argue that what is\ndistinctive about pantheism is precisely its disavowal of any hope for\npersonal immortality. However, some have argued that a measure of\nendurance may be found in so far as we recognize our real identity\nwith, either the eternal universe (for example, Schopenhauer\n1851, 267–82) or, perhaps more specifically with the ongoing life of\nour community (for example, John Caird 1880.) A small number of\npantheistic thinkers have attempted to develop more genuinely personal\nsenses of immortality. For example, Spinoza controversially claims that\n“The human mind cannot be absolutely destroyed with the body, but\nsomething of it remains which is eternal” (Ethics\ne5p23). Josiah Royce, in his early Absolute Idealist phase, attempted to\nargue that if our finite will, which in this life is never quite\nsatisfied, is itself but a part of a greater infinite will that is\neternally satisfied, then that can only mean that we must find our\nshare of that satisfaction “in a life that is not this present\nmortal life” (Royce 1906, 147).","contact.mail":"william.mander@hmc.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"hmc.ox.ac.uk"}]
