Proponents of embodied cognitive science\nview this as a serious mistake. Sometimes the nature of the dependence\nof cognition on the body is quite unexpected, and suggests new ways of\nconceptualizing and exploring the mechanics of cognitive\nprocessing.\n\n\n\nEmbodied cognitive science encompasses a loose-knit family of\nresearch programs in the cognitive sciences that often share a\ncommitment to critiquing and even replacing traditional approaches to\ncognition and cognitive processing. Empirical research on embodied\ncognition has exploded in the past 10 years. As the bibliography for\nthis article attests, the various bodies of work that will be discussed\nrepresent a serious alternative to the investigation of cognitive\nphenomena.\n\n\n\nRelatively recent work on the embodiment of cognition provides much\nfood for thought for empirically-informed philosophers of mind. This is\nin part because of the rich range of phenomena that embodied cognitive\nscience has studied. But it is also in part because those phenomena are\noften thought to challenge dominant views of the mind, such as the\ncomputational and representational theories of mind, at the heart of\ntraditional cognitive science. And they have sometimes been taken to\nundermine standard positions in the philosophy of mind, such as the\nidea that the mind is identical to, or even realized in, the brain.\n\n\n\nConsider four evocative examples of phenomena that have motivated\nembodied cognitive science.  \nAlthough phenomena such as (1)–(4) motivate embodied\ncognitive science, appealing to such phenomena to arrive at more\nsubstantive conclusions that have been drawn—for example, that\ntraditional cognitive science is deeply flawed, or that dominant\npositions in the philosophy of mind, such as functionalism, are\nmistaken—requires further philosophical argument. Because the\nrequisite argumentation typically appeals to other concepts central to\nwork in empirically-informed philosophy of mind and cognitive science\nitself, such as modularity and nativism, debate over embodied cognition\nhas become a hot topic in cognitive science in recent years (Adams\n2010; Aizawa 2007; Chemero 2009; Shapiro 2011). \n\nTraditional cognitive science has certainly conceptualized central\ncognitive processing, what we will call cognition in the\nnarrow sense, in abstraction from bodily mechanisms of sensory\nprocessing and motor control. Research programs within artificial\nintelligence exemplify this view of cognition in the narrow sense, and\nthey have been one of the clearest targets of embodied cognitive\nscience. More positively, embodied cognitive science aims to understand\nthe full range of perceptual, cognitive, and motor capacities we\npossess, cognition in the broad sense, as capacities that are\ndependent upon features of the physical body. In this article, we\nconsider cognition construed both narrowly and broadly, in these\nsenses. \n\nFinally by way of introducing embodied cognitive science, we note\nits relationship to situated cognition (Smith 1999, Robbins\nand Aydede 2009). As a paradigm within situated cognition, embodied\ncognitive science can be distinguished from both the study of\nembedded cognition and the thesis of extended\ncognition. \n\nEmbodied cognitive science appeals to the idea that cognition deeply\ndepends on aspects of the agent's body other than the brain.\nWithout the involvement of the body in both sensing and acting,\nthoughts would be empty, and mental affairs would not exhibit the\ncharacteristics and properties they do. Work on embedded cognition, by\ncontrast, draws on the view that cognition deeply depends on the\nnatural and social environment. By focusing on the strategies organisms\nuse to off-load cognitive processing onto the environment, this work\nplaces particular emphasis on the ways in which cognitive activity is\ndistributed across the agent and her physical, social, and cultural\nenvironment (Suchman 1987, Hutchins 1995). The thesis of extended\ncognition is the claim that cognitive systems themselves extend beyond\nthe boundary of the individual organism. On this view, features of an\nagent's physical, social, and cultural environment can do more than\ndistribute cognitive processing: they may well partially constitute\nthat agent's cognitive system. (Clark and Chalmers 1998, R. Wilson\n2004; A. Clark 2008, Menary 2010). \n\nWe follow recent authors (A. Clark 2008; Rupert 2009b; Shapiro 2010,\n2011) in holding that while embodied cognitive science can be neatly\ndistinguished, in principle, from both of these other forms of situated\ncognition, and that there are times when this is useful (even crucial),\nthe broader philosophical issues in play are also revealingly discussed\nsometimes by considering these views together. Thus, although this\narticle focuses on the specific ways in which cognition depends on the\nphysical body, it also discusses situated cognition more generally, as\nappropriate. \nA consideration (Sections 2.1–2.3) of three landmark\npublications provides a historical anchor for understanding early work\non embodied cognition in the narrow sense: George Lakoff and Mark\nJohnson's Metaphors We Live By (1980), the enactive\nperspective on cognition developed by Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson,\nand Eleanor Rosch in their The Embodied Mind (1991); and work\non robotics and computationally intelligent action summarized and\nanalyzed in Andy Clark's Being There: Putting Mind, World,\nand Body Back Together (1997). We then turn more briefly to\ninfluential work on embodied cognition in the broad sense (Sections 2.4–2.5) and on the phenomenological tradition within continental\nphilosophy that has inspired more recent embodied cognitive science\n(Section 2.6). \nFigurative language\nclearly plays a role in cognition, and philosophers, linguists, and\npsychologists have all contributed to its understanding in cognitive\nscience (Black 1962; Ortony 1979). Beginning in their Metaphors We\nLive By (1980), George Lakoff and Mark Johnson argued that such\nlanguage, and metaphor in particular, was not simply a phenomenon to be\nstudied in the domain of cognition, but actively structures much of\ncognition traditionally thought to be isolated from metaphor. For\nexample, many central cognitive processes, such as those concerning\nspace and time, were, claimed Lakoff and Johnson, both expressed and\ninfluenced by metaphor (hence “metaphors we live by”). If\nhuman experience is intricately bound up with large-scale metaphors,\nand both experience and metaphor are shaped up by the kinds of bodies\nwe have that mediate between agent and world, argued Lakoff and\nJohnson, then cognition is embodied in a way not anticipated within\ntraditional cognitive science. \nAlthough Lakoff (1987) and Johnson (1987) developed the basic idea here\nin different ways (see also Lakoff and Johnson 1999, Johnson 2007), the\ngeneral flavor of the view they share can be conveyed by considering a\nwell-known example they discuss: that of love as a kind of journey.\nThose in a romantic relationship are often said to head off together,\ntravel the same path, take wrong turns, retrace their steps, check\ntheir bearings, and pack their bags. For Lakoff and Johnson, this\nnon-literal language is not merely peripheral expression useful for\nadding bells and whistles to the bustle of communication, but reflects\nsomething deep about how love is conceptualized. Importantly, the\ncentral organizing metaphor—love is a journey—involves a\nmapping from one domain (journeys) to another (love), where the source\ndomain is informed by our bodily physicality and the embodied\nexperience that we have as creatures who move through the world to\nachieve purposes and goals. \n\nSpatial concepts, such as “front”, “back”,\n“up”, and “down”, provide perhaps the clearest\nexamples in which such embodied experience exists. These concepts are\narticulated in terms of our body's position in, and movement\nthrough, space. Creatures like us that stand upright and move forward,\nfor example, think of things that are “in front of”\nthemselves as located in the line of vision or in terms of the\ndirection they are moving. Creatures that were long and flat and moved\nbackwards, by contrast, might have a very different concept of\n“in front of”, or perhaps none at all. Likewise for other\nspatial concepts, such as “up”. We might get a first-hand\nfeel for the embodied nature of such concepts in situations when we\napproximate such creatures, such as when we try to use such concepts to\nguide our action when we are laying down, moving backwards, or even\nlooking in a rear-vision mirror. The experience of\n“upness”, proponents of embodied cognition claim, depends\non the particular kind of body we have, and how that body interacts\nwith its surroundings (Lakoff and Johnson 1999). \nThis example can also be used to illustrate why embodied cognition has\nproven to be a contentious view within cognitive science and the\nphilosophy of mind. One might argue that the dependence between our\nspatial concepts and our bodies identified above is mundane and\nunremarkable. Consider the best-known of classic mind-body dualists,\nRené Descartes. In his famous quip in Meditation VI, that he (his mind,\nfor Descartes) was not merely lodged in his body “like a pilot in\na ship”, Descartes clearly recognizes that there is some sense in\nwhich cognition depends on, and is integrated with, the body.\nProponents of embodied cognition must, minimally, show that\n“front” and “up” depend on the body in some\nsense that Descartes would deny. \n\nOf more relevance to contemporary debates, proponents of embodied\ncognition must show that this dependence cannot be accommodated within\ntraditional cognitive science and its working commitments (e.g., to the\ncomputational and representational theories of mind). At least this is\ntrue if embodied cognition is to mark a significant departure from, and\npose a substantive challenge to, traditional cognitive science and\nassociated philosophical views of the mind. And that requires,\nminimally, not only identifying some kind of dependence or other\nbetween cognition and the body, but specifying the nature of that\ndependence. \nThe book The Embodied\nMind (Varela, Thompson and Rosch 1991) was an attempt to re-direct\nthe cognitive sciences by infusing them with the phenomenological\nperspective developed in the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1945).\n(More ambitiously, and less successfully, it also aimed to integrate\ncognitive science with Buddhist philosophy; the book also included some\npassing discussion of psychoanalysis.) Varela, Thompson and Rosch\nargued that the standard division between pre-given, external features\nof the world and internal symbolic representations should be dropped,\nas it is unable to accommodate the feedback from embodied actions to\ncognition via the actions of a situated cognitive agent. The\nfundamental differences between their perspective and classical views\nlies in the answers to the questions of what cognition is, how it\nworks, and when a system functions adequately. \nTraditional accounts basically state that there are no computations\nwithout representations, and view cognition as successfully\nfunctioning when any device can support and manipulate symbols to\nsolve the problem given to the system. Varela, Thompson, and Rosch\nintroduced the concept of enaction to present and develop a\nframework that places strong emphasis on the idea that the experienced\nworld is portrayed and determined by mutual interactions between the\nphysiology of the organism, its sensorimotor circuit and the\nenvironment. Their emphasis on the structural coupling of\nbrain-body-world constitutes the kernel of their program of embodied\ncognition, building on the classical phenomenological idea that\ncognitive agents bring forth a world by means of the activity of\ntheir situated living bodies. As the metaphor of\n“bringing forth a world” of meaningful experience implies,\non this view knowledge emerges through the primary agent's bodily\nengagement with the environment, rather than being simply determined\nby and dependent upon either pre-existent situations or personal\nconstruals. \nOne implication of this view is that only a creature with certain\nfeatures—e.g., eyes, hands, legs, and skills—can possess\ncertain kinds of cognitive capacities. This is because cognition is a\ndynamic sensorimotor activity, and the world that is given and\nexperienced is not only conditioned by the neural activity of the\nsubject, but is essentially enacted in that it emerges through the\nbodily activities of the organism. This general approach encourages a\nview of enaction as essentially distinct from computation, as it is\ntraditionally conceived. Varela, Thompson, and Rosch's most detailed\nillustration of their perspective is contained in their discussion of\ncolor experience and categorization, a discussion that received much\nattention in other venues (e.g., Thompson, Palacios, and Varela 1992;\nThompson 1995), typically without reference to the more sweeping\nclaims about embodiment, phenomenology, and Buddhism made in\nThe Embodied Mind (see also Thompson 2007). \nSince its origin, the enactive tradition has grown and enriched in\nvarious ways and each of its strands, though sharing a common\nframework with neighbouring accounts in embodied cognitive science,\nhas developed one’s own theoretical trait and explored a conceptual\nterritory that differentiates them from one another. One variant,\nbranded autopoietic enactivism, has developed in particular the\nbiological phenomenon of autopoiesis and attributed to it a central\nrole in explaining fundamental properties of our mental life (Maturana\nand Varela 1992; Thompson 2005; Di Paolo and Thompson 2014). The\nnotion of autopoiesis describes living systems as active, adaptive,\nself-maintaining and self-individuating, that is, as having the\nproperty of self-reproducing through self-regulating strategies.\nAnother variant, the so-called sensorimotor enactivism, has taken a\nmore liberal route and, rather than stressing the role of autopoietic\norganization in the living systems, it draws on the implicit grasp of\nsensorimotor dependencies (that is, the way in which stimulation\nchanges contingent upon actions of the organisms) to explain conscious\nexperience and a broad range of behaviors (Noe 2004; O’Regan 2011,\nDegenaar and O’Regan forthcoming), Yet another, has gone as radical as\nto say that cognition and experience does not depend on autopoietic\norganization and sensorimotor accounts remain committed to mentalism\nand representationalist thinking (Hutto and Myin’s 2013). In sum,\nalthough these respective varieties are broadly consonant, they come\nto emphasize different features, and internal tensions motivated a\nwiden fragmentation and various forms of elaboration and\nextension. Though we refer to other venues for a thorough discourse on\nthe demarcation line between varieties of enactive proposals (Degenaar\nand O’Regan forthcoming, Menary 2006, Hutto and Myin 2013), here we\nwill limit ourselves to a high-level overview of some reasons for\ntheir disagreement.  One such reason concerns the role ascribed to the\nnotion of autopoiesis.  Whereas the programme that issues from Varela,\nThompson and Rosch maintains that autopoiesis (or self-production) is\na necessary precondition for experience, leading to the idea that\nthere is a deep continuity of life and mind (Thompson 2007) and that\nconsciousness is a particular form of life, both sensorimotor\nenactivism and its radical formulation do not put autopoietic\nprocesses center-stage and do not commit to the view that cognitive\nphenomena build upon peculiar aspects of the organization of living\norganisms (Degenaar and O’Regan forthcoming, Hutto and Myin 2013).  A\nfurther reason for disagreement concerns the rendering of the claim\nthat perceptual experience requires mediating know-how. Whereas\nsensorimotor enactivism advocates that perceptual experience is made\npossible by the possession and skillful exercise of practical\nknowledge of sensorimotor contingencies, the other variants consider\nthe talk of mediating knowledge as a brand of cognitivism (Hutto and\nMyin 2013), somewhat consistent with the theory of mind that grounds\ntraditional cognitive science. In its radical expression, the enactive\nthinking maintains that mentality is to be explained in terms of\ndirect environment-involving embodied engagements. By the early 1990s, work in\ncomputational intelligence had started to explore ways of generating\nintelligent action in robots that shortly became known as the embodied\napproach to robotics. In a pair of papers Rodney Brooks (1991a, 1991b)\nhad presented a general and accessible overview of a new kind of\nintelligent computational architecture, subsumption architecture, that\nwas representation-lite and world-driven. In these respects, it\ndeparted from the representation-crunching intensive traditional views\nof planning and decision-making that had characterized classic AI and\nwas characterized by Brooks as providing “intelligence without\nrepresentation”. Together with computational work by Agre and\nChapman (1987) and Suchman (1987), Brooks's approach suggested a\nview of computational intelligence in which control was governed\nbottom-up by behavior and interaction with the world, rather than by\nplentiful and often complicated internal algorithms and\nrepresentations. \nThe sweep of work in reactive or behavior-based robotics, and its\nidentification as marking a part of the embodied cognitive science, was\nheralded in Andy Clark's Being There: Putting Mind, World,\nand Body Back Together (1997). Clark here provided an integrative\nframework for a wide-range of emerging work on embodiment in the\ncognitive sciences. The big idea in Being There, one with\nlasting impact in embodied cognitive science, is that minds are not for\nthinking, traditionally conceived, but for doing, for getting\nthings done in the world in real time. Rather than developing\n“walking encyclopedias”, robotics in the late 1980s and\nearly 1990s was starting to focus on the dynamic interaction between\nbody and world. Clark drew out affinities between this shift in the\nconception of intelligent action in computational systems and the\nemergence of the idea that cognition was scaffolded, embedded, and\nextended. \n\nThe work we have briefly recounted so far all concerns what we\ncalled cognition in the narrow sense, processes like human memory,\ncategorization, and language processing (Lakoff and Johnson), human and\nnonhuman color categorization (Varela, Thompson, and Rosch), and\ndecision-making and planning in robots and robotic systems (Clark). But\nembodied cognitive science aims to encompass cognition broadly\nconstrued. To convey the flavor of early work here, we briefly consider\nthe work of James Gibson on perception, and Esther Thelen and Linda\nSmith (1994) on infant walking and reaching behaviors (cf. Shapiro\n2011). \nJames Gibson's\n(1979) account of vision challenged the idea that the central problem\nthat the visual system has to solve is how to reconstruct a full-blown,\nthree-dimensional world from the information specified in the\ntwo-dimensional image on the retina. That idea has been prominent in\ntraditional, information processing views of vision, including those of\nRock (1983, 1997), Richard Gregory (1966) and Marr (1982). Gibson\nthinks that this is not a problem the visual system faces because\nvision does not begin with a static retinal array but with an organism\nactively moving through a visually rich environment. Gibson's\npositive approach to vision was to attempt to specify this richness,\nthe information in what he called the ambient optic array,\nespecially invariants in that array, which can be used to distinguish\nagent-dependent and objective features of one's environment. By\nboth emphasizing the role of the movement of a perceiver and the\nintegration of that perceiver in a larger, visually rich environment,\nGibson has been championed as at least a nascent proponent of embodied\nvision (see also Wilson 2004: ch.7; Shapiro 2011: ch.2). \n Esther Thelen and\nLinda Smith (1994) offered a radical challenge to traditional nativist\nviews of cognitive development by applying dynamical systems theory to\ndevelopmental psychology. One important implication of dynamical\nsystems theory is that systems can generate novel behaviors (e.g.,\ndifferent solutions for reaching objects) through bodily activity,\nquestioning the need to posit preprogrammed patterns that unfold over\ntime. Raising fundamental questions about shared assumptions in the\nfield, they argued that the stepping behavior in infants is not driven\nby maturational processes somehow determined by a hard-wired genetic\ncode, but results instead from the interaction between the\ninfant's initial spontaneous limb movements and changing\ncontexts. Thus, they viewed this particular aspect of development as an\nemergent and self organizing product of many decentralized and local\ninteractions taking place in real time, with the promise of\ngeneralizing this approach to cognitive development more generally.  Finally by way of recent historical\nanchoring, the idea that an understanding of the body underpins the\nvery possibility of experience has roots in the\nphenomenological works of Edmund Husserl (1913, 1931), Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty (1945), and Jean-Paul Sartre (1943), roots we saw\nacknowledged by Varela, Thompson, and Rosch in The Embodied\nMind. This earlier continental tradition was explored\nconstructively early on within artificial intelligence, with special\nreference to Heidegger, by Winograd and Flores (1986) and also formed\nthe backdrop to Dreyfus's (1972) classic critique of traditional\ncomputationalism. \n\nEmbodied cognitive science pushes phenomenological accounts in new\ndirections. It seeks not so much to understand how physicality opens up\nthe experience of the self, the world and the others, but rather aims\nto specify the mechanisms that explain just how cognition is\ngrounded in, and deeply constrained by, the bodily nature of cognitive\nagency. We shall not explore the convergence between the early\nphenomenological tradition and embodied cognitive science, although we\nrecognize that phenomenological insights can be an indispensable\nresource for the ongoing investigation of consciousness,\nself-consciousness, action and intersubjectivity (see Gallagher 2009;\nGallagher and Zahavi 2008; Thompson 2007; Gallagher 2005; Wheeler\n2005). \n\nThe general characterization of embodied cognition with which we\nbegan provides the basis for what we will call the Embodiment\nThesis: \n\nAll five of the early examples of work in embodied cognition that we\nbriefly summarized in Section 2 accept the Embodiment Thesis. The\nworking hypothesis of embodied cognitive science is that this thesis is\ntrue either because of the significant causal or the significant\nphysically constitutive role of the body in cognitive processing.\nProponents of embodied cognitive science have advocated both the causal\nand the constitutive claim about the role of the body in cognition.\nWhile the ascription of a physically constitutive role to the body in\ncognition has been taken to challenge traditional cognitive science in\na more radical way than does that of a merely significant causal role\nto it, both versions of the Embodiment Thesis mark a departure from\nviews of the mind dominant in traditional cognitive science. \nRather than following those who attempt to explain embodied cognition\nby appeal to the metaphor of grounding (e.g., Anderson 2003;\nBarsalou 1999, 2008; Glenberg and Robertson 2000; Glenberg et al.\n2005), we think that the best way to articulate the Embodiment Thesis\nfurther is to specify the nature of the dependence of cognition on the\nbody: what particular significant causal or physically constitutive\nroles does the body play in cognition? (cf. Shapiro 2010, 2011; A.\nClark 2008; Thompson 2007; Wheeler 2005; Anderson 2003; M. Wilson\n2002). \nAt the most general level, there are three such distinct functions or\nroles, each with its own implications for embodied cognitive science.\nThe body can function as a constraint on cognition, as a\ndistributor for cognitive processing, or as a\nregulator of cognitive activity. \n\nWe can specify each of these functions or roles more precisely, and\ndraw attention to the distinctive implications that each has, and the\nwork already described that appeals to each of these conceptions of the\nEmbodiment Thesis. \n\nAmongst the alleged implications of the Body as Constraint thesis\nare two we would like to draw attention to: \n\nThe work of Lakoff and Johnson on the permeation of cognition by\nmetaphor, and that of Varela, Thompson, and Rosch on enactive cognition\n(especially in the domain of color perception and categorization), both\nexemplify the Body as Constraint thesis. \nUnlike the role of the body in the Body as Constraint thesis, here\nthe body is taken as sharing in cognitive processing itself, serving to\ndistribute cognitive tasks between brain and body. The Body as\nDistributor thesis has three putative implications worth making\nexplicit: \n\nAs these implications should suggest, it is Body as Distributor that\nis in play for those who take embodied cognition to challenge\ntraditional views of mental representation (Gibson 1979 and Thelen and\nSmith 1994; see also Glenberg 1997 on memory; Shapiro 1997 and Wilson\n2004: ch.7–8 on exploitative representation). The appeal to\nmorphological computation (MacIver 2009), whereby properties\nof anatomical structures (such as the shape of bats ears) play a\ncomputational role in a cognitive process (such as echolocation), also\nrelies on the Body as Distributor thesis. And in subsuming both an\nagent's bodily structures as well as aspects of its environment\nas forms of non-neural structures, the Body as Distributor thesis draws\na connection between embodied cognition and versions of the extended\nmind thesis that appeal to concepts such as realization and scaffolding\n(Wilson and Clark 2009; R. Wilson 2004: ch.5–6; A. Clark 2003). \nClosely related to the Body as Distributor thesis is: \nWe distinguish this version of the Embodiment Thesis from the Body\nas Distributor thesis because of distinctive supposed implications that\nascribing a regulative role to the body in cognition has. These\ninclude: \n\nHere the body has a feedback-driven role in cognitive processing,\nand the Body as Regulator thesis has been especially prominent in\ndynamic approaches to cognition (e.g., Port and van Gelder 1995; Beer\n2000; Thelen and Smith 1994; cf. also Chemero 2009). \nTo summarize this section: we have distinguished three ways to\narticulate the Embodied Cognition Thesis, each specifying a particular\nway in which cognition depends on the body. Put more positively (and we\nthink informatively), there are three distinctive functions or roles\nfor the body that embodied cognitive science might ascribe: as a\nconstraint on cognition, as a distributor for cognitive processing, and\nas a real-time regulator of cognitive activity. Such determinate forms\nof the Embodiment Thesis can ascribe the body either a significant\ncausal role, or a physically constitutive role, in cognition. \n\nIn this section, we explore the revolutionary promise of embodied\ncognitive science with respect to three standard topics in the\nphilosophy of mind and cognitive science: the modularity of mind, the\nnature of mental representation, and nativism. (For alternative views\nof situated cognition and modularity, representation, and nativism, see\nBechtel 2009; Rowlands 2009; and Rupert 2009a). We begin with some\ngeneral, putative contrasts between traditional and embodied cognitive\nscience. \nTraditional views have tended to assume the existence of discrete,\ninternal representations realized by underlying, sharply distinct and\nhighly specified mechanisms in the brain. These mechanisms, in turn,\nhave been shaped by natural selection and encoded in genetic\nstructures. Thus, traditional views have been influential in\nneuroscience and have been committed to individualism or internalism,\nthe claim that cognition supervenes on the intrinsic, physical\nproperties of the cognizer. The research strategy of\n“methodological solipsism” (Fodor 1980, 1981) is one\nclassic version of this individualistic conception of cognition. The\nway in which central topics have been addressed deeply reflects the\nidea that cognitive phenomena can be accounted for locally, and that\nelements beyond the boundaries of the skull are of interest only\ninsofar as they provide sensory input and allow behavioral output.\nBorrowing from Susan Hurley (1998), mainstream views of the mind have\nbeen committed to the “classical sandwich model”, the claim\nthat cognition (in the narrow sense) is segregated from processing in\nlow-level systems, therefore acting like meat in a sandwich em-breaded\nby perception and\naction. \nEmbodied cognitive science, by contrast, has modeled cognition as the\nproduct of dynamic interplay between neural and non-neural processes,\nwith no general fracture between cognition, the agent's bodily\nexperience, and real-life contexts. Here the body is viewed as\nconstraining, distributing, or regulating cognitive processing.\nSpecifying how the body performs these functions in particular\nenvironments raises the prospect that cognition itself is neither\nbounded by the brain, nor perhaps even by the body itself. \nWe can express the prima facie contrast between traditional and\nembodied cognitive science in terms of opposed views of mental\nrepresentation, computation, and realization. Whereas many traditional\naccounts tend to see cognition as representationally localistic,\ncomputationally fixed, and as properly characterized independently of\nthe realizing neuronal system, the features of the physical body and\nthe surrounding environment., embodied cognitive science tends to view\ncognition as, representationally distributed, computationally dynamic,\nand as properly characterized only by reference to details of bodily\nrealization. Embodied cognitive science thus motivates an interrogation\nof some of the fundamental assumptions made in cognitive science. (Such\nprobing is also manifest in views of cognitive modeling that themselves\nare not especially embodied, such as connectionism, which we leave\naside here.)\n \n Modular systems are independent, domain\nspecific, encapsulated and hardwired, and function in a low-to-high\nprocessing hierarchy. When modularity theory was introduced in\ncognitive science (Fodor 1983), central cognition—cognition in\nthe narrow sense—was characterized as non-modular, and as sharply\ndistinct from modular peripheral systems, such as those governing\nperception and motor control (plus, as Fodor says, language).\nFodor's claims about central cognition have been challenged by a\nwide variety of researchers (e.g., Carruthers 2006; Sperber 2001;\nCosmides and Tooby 1997; Hirshfeld and Gelman 1994; see also R. Wilson\n2005, 2008). These critics have argued that higher-cognitive processes\nalso meet modularity criteria. In fact, the view that cognition in the\nnarrow sense is also modular is sufficiently widespread across\ndevelopmental, evolutionary, and cognitive psychology perhaps to count\nas the dominant form of modularity theory in contemporary cognitive\nscience, despite Fodor's contrary view (Fodor 2000). \n\nBoth the traditional, Fodorian account of modularity and its\nrebellious, dominant offspring make reference to the body and the\nenvironment only indirectly. Modularity theory in either guise has\nlittle positive to say about the actual bearing of the beyond-the\nskull-entities on cognitive performance, other than viewing them as a\nsource of input and repository of behavioral output. This view implies\nthat all the tough work, cognitively speaking, is performed by\ncognition central alone, with peripheral processes simply providing\ninputs and executing instructions. The claims that cognitive processing\noccurs purely in the brain in a modular fashion, and accomplishes its\nbusiness by operating essentially independently from motor planning and\nmotor execution, however, are called into question by empirical studies\nof embodied experience. \nOne example of embodied experience in relation to language, one that\nexemplifies the Body as Constraint thesis is Glenberg's Indexical\nHypothesis (Glenberg et alia 2009; Glenberg and Kaschak 2002; Glenberg\nand Robertson 1999, 2000). This view assumes that the understanding of\na sentence is achieved through the activation of relevant action\nschemas, recruiting the same neural mechanisms active in overt\nbehavior, and by affordance combination. Consider the sentences: \n\nAlthough both (1a) and (1b) are grammatical, the reason why (1b)\ndoes not make the same kind of sense as (1a) does is because the\naffordances of glasses do not mesh with the action of drying.\nUnderstanding the meaning of such sentences requires knowing the\npossibilities offered by objects referred to in them. These\npossibilities are constrained by the interaction between bodily\ncapabilities and the referents. Another study showed that people are\nfaster to comprehend sentences where objects provide the affordances\nneeded to accomplish an action (e.g., chair with four wheels to move\nlarge boxes) than sentences in which objects do not (e.g., a chair with\nfour missing wheels (Kaschak and Glenberg 2000). \nSuch findings indicate that the construal of meaning is constrained by\nthe embodied possibilities a scenario offers, and suggest that\nsensorimotor processes contribute to language comprehension. This\nconclusion would likely be rejected by modularists because their\ncommitment to encapsulation and domain specificity implies that\nlanguage processing cannot be modulated by motor information and\nbackground knowledge. Borghi, Glenberg and Kaschak (2004) have also\nreported that in language comprehension the perspective implied by the\nsentence guides the retrieval of information about objects, making\nconceptual knowledge available. Responses to questions over whether an\nobject (e.g., a table) is part of the location described in the\nsentence are faster if there is compatibility between the object-noun\nand the perspective implied by the sentence (e.g., eating in a\nrestaurant). Embodied responses are activated also in judging specific\nobjects' properties, suggesting that vision and action are\ntightly integrated in the biological organism, and that they jointly\nconstrain cognitive processing. \nThe sharp distinction between vision and action that is part of the\ntraditional modular account of cognition has also been challenged by\nstudies of embodied experience. For example, when people are asked to\nchoose among stairs of different heights the one they can ascend most\neasily their responses are consistent with respect to their\nstair-climbing abilities (Warren 1984). Similar results have been\nreported for judgments of grasping objects (van Leeuwen et alia 1994)\ncatching balls (Oudejams et alia 1996) and climbing walls (Wagman and\nCarello 2001). Studies such as these support the general claim that\nperceptual experience incorporates anticipated embodied interaction,\nsuggesting either that vision and action are integrated, or at least\nfeedback linked, in ways that are incompatible with the flow-through\nmodel of cognition postulated by modularists (Hurley 1998; R. Wilson\n2010). \nEven ascribing emotions, intentions or beliefs to someone appears to\npresuppose a certain bodily realization. Unlike traditional views,\nwhich posit an innate Theory of Mind module to account for social\ncognition (Leslie, 1987; Baron-Cohen 1995), an increasing number of\nstudies in the field (Rizzolatti and Craighero 2004; Rizzolatti et alia\n1996; Gallese et alia 1996), suggests that the understanding of other\nminds is primarily based on the motor expertise underlying our capacity\nto act. Such embodied understanding is not only different in nature\nfrom the modalities of mindreading as traditionally understood, but\nalso strongly indicates that the meaning of intentional behavior can be\ngrasped only if we know bodily, experientially or both what it is like\nto be in a mental state. \nThe processing that underwrites a variety of mental\nphenomena—discerning meaningful sentences from those that are\nnot, extracting the possibilities afforded by objects, and detecting\nintentional behaviors—thus requires the orchestrated contribution\nof many components, neural and non-neural. If bodily states and\nbrain's modality-specific systems serve as the grounding of\nvarious aspects of our cognitive life, then traditional, amodal\ndomain-specific modules are not the meaningful elements of analysis\nthey have been assumed to be under the Disembodiment Thesis. The claim\nthat cognition heavily relies on the processes evolved to allow\norganisms to interact effectively with the environment suggests that\nthe mind is not decoupled from embodied experience in the way\npresupposed by traditional views in cognitive science. Rather, the body\ncan act as a constraint on cognition, and as a\ndistributor for cognitive processing (see Section 3). \nAt the heart of the\ntraditional scientific understanding of cognition lies a particular\nconception of mental representation (Fodor and Pylyshyn 1988; Newell\nand Simon 1972). This conception claims that representations are\nsymbolic structures with quasi-linguistic and combinatorial properties,\nact as vehicles of contents, and are what are primarily appealed to in\nexplaining intelligent behavior. Mental representations are symbolic\nand abstract in that the same representation, such as\n“table” is used to mean different kinds of table. They are\namodal in that the same representation can be employed when\n“table” is written or spoken about. Such representations\nare arbitrarily related to their referents because the way in which\nthey are formed and deployed, along with their characteristics, bears\nno relationship to the physical and functional features of the\nreferents. Thus, on the traditional view, not only are the internal\nrepresentations employed in language, concept formation, and memory\nessentially distinct from those processed by the sensorimotor system,\nbut their meaning is divorced from bodily experience. Supporters of\nthis view have been committed to at least three fundamental\nprinciples: \nRecently, several alternative explanations for adaptive behavior\nhave gained attention. While diverse, they all call into question the\ncommitment to these principles. By advancing the idea that cognitive\nactivity re-uses the processes and the representations deployed in\nperception and action, these explanations pose a serious challenge to\nthe notion that conceptual and semantic representations are (or must\nbe) amodal. There remain significant differences between these views\nwith respect to the radicalness of their anti-representationalist\nleanings (see Chemero 2009; Hutto and Myin 2013; Myin and Degenaar 2014). \nAmongst the most influential anti-representationalist views is\ndynamical systems theory (Beer 1990, 2002, 2003; Brooks 1991a, 1991b,\n2002; Thelen and Smith 1994; Van Gelder 1992). Dynamicists tend to\nminimize and sometimes even deny the need for a centralized\nrepresentational processor. The notion of representation that these\nauthors challenge is relatively specific: an internal model capable of\nreproducing the external environmental structure that is used by the\ncognitive agent to guide its behavior in relative independence from the\nworld. Dynamical systems theory has proven to be popular in robotics\nand in work on artificial life, which has tried to explain adaptive\nbehavior in terms of embodiment and embeddedness. As long as a situated\ncreature can sense its world so as to allow its body to be directly\ninfluenced, abstract symbolic descriptions can be dispensed with. \nFormulating an empirically adequate theory of intelligent behavior\nwithout appealing to representations at all, however, faces insuperable\ndifficulties, and the idea that it is a relatively trivial matter to\nscale up from existing dynamic models to explain all of cognition\nremains wishful thinking and subject to just the problems that\nmotivated the shift from behaviorism to cognitive science in the first\nplace. For example, organism-environment interaction alone cannot\naccount for anticipatory behavior, which involves internal factors\nbeyond the immediate constraints of the environment to achieve or\nfulfill future needs, goals or conditions. Domains raising a\nrepresentation-hungry problem (A. Clark 1997) are those involving\nreasoning about absent, non-existent or counterfactual states of\naffairs, planning, imaging and interacting (for a recent, contrasting\nview, see Chemero 2009). \nMoreover, it is unclear why embodied cognitive science could not also\nbe symbolic, representational, abstract, etc.. Puzzlement here is\nmagnified by the fact that many self-styled embodied approaches to\ncognition are symbolic, representational, abstract, etc.. What\nthey offer are specific views of what mental symbols and\nrepresentations are, and how they function in our cognitive economy.\nTypically, they replace the conception of propositional encoding with\none according to which symbols convey a modality-specific feature. \nOne view that adapts, rather than dispenses with, the notion of mental\nrepresentation is Lawrence Barsalou's perceptual symbols theory\n(1999, 2003, 2008, 2009). This theory rests on the assumption that\nhuman cognition does not consist of amodal representations that bear\narbitrary relations to their referents in the world, but rather\nrepresentations whose activation patterns include information from\nvarious sensory modalities. For example, the symbolic structure that\nrepresents the color of an object in its absence, say, during imagery\nor problem solving tasks, depends upon the same neural system that is\nrecruited when the color is actually perceived. Thus, not only do\ncognitive and perceptual mechanisms share representational states, but\ncognitive processing essentially re-activates sensorimotor areas to run\nperceptual simulations. A further implication is that perceptual\nsymbols are not independent of the biological system that embodies them\nand the content conveyed would be likely to vary if intelligent systems\nvaried physically. Since appeal to the body and sensorimotor processes\nconstrains the nature of symbols available to cognition,\nBarsalou's theory exemplifies the Body as Constraint\nthesis. \nWhile defenders of modal representations argue that there is little\ndirect empirical evidence for amodal representations, with the adoption\nof the traditional model of representation largely motivated by\ntheoretical reasons (Barsalou et alia 2003, 85), and that their own\nviews are empirically plausible (see Pecher et alia 2003; Zwaan and\nYaxley 2003; Glenberg and Kaschak 2002; Martin and Chao 2001; Solomon\nand Barsalou 2001; Martin et alia 2000; Spivey et alia 2000), they also\nunderestimate the difficulty of providing definitive evidence against\namodal accounts. As Machery (2007) points out, subjects'\nperformance can be accommodated by both modal and amodal explanations\n(see also Rupert 2006). Since most amodal advocates (e.g., Simon 1995;\nFodor 1975) do not deny the involvement of perceptual areas during\ncognitive tasks, such as visual imagery, showing that visual cortex is\nactivated when, say, imaging the green of an apple does not provide\nevidence for Barsalou's theory over the amodal account. Moreover,\nas traditionalists point out, some mental problems are solved without\n(reportable) imagery, and subjects sometimes draw upon knowledge stored\nin modality-free representational systems. Hence, generalizing results\nconcerning the use of perceptual simulations in some tasks to all\ntasks, which is required for a general modal theory of representation,\nis problematic. \n Most researchers today recognize that cognition\ndevelops as a result of the dynamic interplay of innateness and\nlearning, even if it is not always clear how this interplay proceeds.\nOn the two-dimensional view of nativism defended by one of us elsewhere\nthat distinguishes between strong and weak forms of nativism, (R.\nWilson 2004: ch.3), strong nativists are committed to the following two\ntheses: \n\nStrong anti-nativists (such as classic empiricists), by contrast,\ndeny both of these general views. \n\nParadigms committed to strong nativism has produced remarkable\nresults in the field of cognitive development of infants, in domains\nincluding arithmetic and physics (Baillargeon 2002, Baillargeon et alia\n1985; Spelke et alia 1992, 1995). Those critical of nativism have\nlabeled nativism as antidevelopmental in nature (Haith 1998), and\nclaimed that conclusions that the mind consists of hard-wired traits\nthat unfold through maturation on a fixed pattern conflict with the\nvery idea of learning and flexibility (Quartz and Sejnowski 1997;\nThelen and Smith 1994; Bates et alia 1995; Karmiloff-Smith 1994). If\nnativism were true, then the body and environment (including culture),\nwhile relevant, should be regarded as no more than\n“triggers” of ontogenetically determined features that\ndevelop in predictable ways. \nAlthough prima facie it might be thought that embodied cognition has no\ndistinctive implications for the ongoing debate between\n“nativism” and “empiricism”, one contribution\nof embodied cognitive science here lies in its specific exploration of\nthe roles that the body plays in cognitive processing. These roles\noften pose challenges to strong nativist and strong empiricist views\nalike. As such, embodied cognitive science does not simply assume, with\nempiricists, that cognitive processing depends to a great extent on\nenvironmental exposure, and that cognition is a causal reflection of\nit. Further, while empiricists typically conceive of the world as\nsomething objectively given to a subject, who thus forms a static\nrepresentation of it that then guides action, embodied cognitive\nscience addresses how the dynamic interplay between embodied agent and\nthe world generates cognition. It is this focus on dynamic, worldly\ninterplay that provides one link from embodied to embedded cognition\nwithin situated cognitive science. Here we will explore whether, and in\nwhat ways, embodied cognitive science has been thought to undermine\nstrong nativist claims. \nBy and large, embodied cognitive science generally downplays the\ninternal richness needed to perform complex behavior (Rupert 2009a),\nhighlighting the fact that cognitive processing and development are\ndeeply affected by perturbation across changes in the environment and\nthe body in action (Griffiths and Stotz 2000; Clark and Toribio 1994;\nThelen and Smith 1994; Varela, Thompson and Rosch 1991; Ballard 1991).\nThe body in action is a powerful constraint on how organisms conceive\ntheir niche, as this constraint allows certain interactions and\nexperiences to have an effect on concept formation and understanding of\nlinguistic meaning. For example, by having fingers capable of grasping\nobjects and legs capable of walking and climbing walls, we sort and\ncategorize stimuli in ways that are radically different from, say, the\nways in which they are sorted by butterflies. One's own\nordinarily kinesthetic experiences essentially frame the acquisition\nand development of cognitive structures. That appears to support the\nsignificant contribution of the beyond-the-skull components in\nrealizing cognitive phenomena, and in terms of the framework we have\nintroduced (see section 3) it exemplifies both the Body as Constraint\nand Body as Distributor theses. \n\nExamples supporting the Body as Distributor thesis come\nfrom non-nativist research on perception. Many putative modules, such\nas those for sensory processing, develop partly via learning. In the\nnewborn, sensory modalities and cortical pathways are not as\ndifferentiated as are those of mature brains but appear to emerge\nthrough a series of strengthening interactions between the active body\nand the environment (Quartz and Sejnowski 1997). This implies that in\ninfants few, if any, cortical pathways are domain specific and highly\nspecialized for most tasks, but during development by virtue of active\ninteractions with the environment get recruited and tuned up for\nprocessing particular stimuli (Elman et alia 1996). Other empirical\nresults in the study of sensory modalities point in the same direction,\nrejecting the idea that the senses are dedicated modules wired up for\nperception at birth, with the body's interactions with the\nenvironment playing only a secondary role in constraining or even\ndetermining the nature of perceptual processing. \n\nConversely, it seems that many relevant capacities are not as\ndomain-specific as they may initially appear. For example, even though\nthe visual cortex appears dedicated to process a particular class of\ninformation, it can be recruited by a different sense modality during\nthe reading of Braille—whether the subject has congenital,\nacquired or induced (blindfold) blindness (Sadato et alia 1996, 1998;\nsee also Pascual-Leone and Hamilton 2001; Pascual-Leone et alia 1998).\nIf we extend these observations to face recognition, further support\nfor the hypothesis that specialization begins at later stage of\ndevelopment, by virtue of experience, arises. Despite the fact that the\nfusiform face area (FFA) is highly selective to faces (Kanwisher 2000;\nKanwisher et alia 1997), data suggest that it can also be activated in\nresponse to non-face features, such as birds and cars, provided that\nsubjects have a substantial expertise in those categories (Gauthier et\nalia 2000). While this evidence does not call into question the idea of brain\nspecialization, it does indicate the role of bodily activity in\ngenerating the differentiation of cortical pathways and the emergence\nof specific functions, such as direction-selective responses in the\nvisual cortex. Embodied interactions with the world shape and control\nthe mechanisms responsible for this information processing, offering\nsupport for the Body as Distributor and Body as Regulator\ntheses. Additionally, consider studies investigating how switching\nhandedness shapes cortical sensorimotor representations of finger\nmovements. A left to right switch of handwriting not only triggers a\ngeneral re-organization of motor dominance but also has a wider impact\non the functional neuroanatomy of the motor system that controls the\nhands, influencing even motor tasks that require little skill\n(Kloeppel et al 2007). The re-organization patterns found in converted\nleft-handers show how flexible the brain is in terms of which regions\ncan do what in response to educational training and hand use\nthroughout life, and how bodily features and interaction schemas are\nconditions to which the brain is attuned to.  These studies can be\ninterpreted as suggesting that embodied interactions and the\nbeyond-the-body environment may themselves be partial realizers of the\ncorresponding cognitive activity. Including non-neural parts of the\nbody amongst the physically constitutive building blocks of cognition\nsuggests a more radical reading of embodied cognition. \n\nStrong nativist claims may also be challenged when considering\ncognition beyond the sense modalities. The issue concerning how much\nlanguage-specific information, if any, is innate has been one of the\ndominant topic in cognitive science and the literature relevant to the\nmatter provides us with a wide range of possibilities. Some (Pinker\n1994; Chomsky 1975, 1980), for instance, conclude that a specific\ninnate endowment help explain several aspects of children's\nlinguistic performance. Others (Cowie 1999; Bates 1998; Bates et alia\n1995), instead, find this conception unparsimonious and puzzling from\nan evolutionary standpoint, and claim that nonlinguistic learning\nfactors significantly constrain and control the range of possibilities\nthat characterize spoken language. \n\nEncouragement for this latter view comes from evidence that shows\nhow language acquisition heavily depends, beyond environmental\nexposure, on a number of different factors, including working memory\nand general cognitive development (Seung and Chapman, 2000). First\nlanguage learning, for instance, builds on what children already know\nabout objects and events they experienced and this knowledge background\nprovides them with the basis onto which they can map words (see E.\nClark 2004 for reviews). Their ability to develop a language is also\naffected by information they receive from adults and caregivers.\nAccordingly, they will be sensitive and prone to pick up the\nregularities they hear more often, such as frequent words, sounds,\ninflections and grammar constructions (Saffran et alia 1996; De\nVilliers 1985). Also social interactions appear to be crucial to the\nprocess of language acquisition. Children more quickly learn to name\nthings that are physically present during a conversation and to which\nthe joint focus of attention is directed (E . Clark 2003; Tomasello\n2003). Even language development in children affected by Autistic\nSpectrum Disorder (ASD), commonly held to have a genetic origin, can be\nmodulated by parental and social factors, such as gender and high level\nof education (Grandgeorge et alia 2009). The same holds for normal\ndevelopment in which the size and production of a child's\nvocabulary appears to be deeply related to parents' lexical\nrichness, monitoring of language interaction and socioeconomic status\n(Hoff 2003; Hoff and Naigles 2002). \n\nImplications of these findings support the Body as Distributor\nthesis and place primary emphasis on the view that properties of\nlanguage-learning process heavily depend on the environmental and\nsocial conditions within which an individual is raised. They also\nindicate that direct engagement with the world and other individuals\nregulate language functioning and that this functioning is inseparably\nlinked to and exploits the affordances of the situation within which\nlanguage processes take place. \n\nFurther support for the Body as Distributor thesis comes from\nevidence that differences in early gesture explain disparities in\nchildren's vocabulary size (Rowe and Goldin-Meadow 2009a).\nParents frequently appealing to gesture to translate their words\nprovide children with an opportunity to learn particular meanings by\nhands and this parent-child gesture use accounts for the correlation\nbetween early gesture of children at 14 months and later vocabulary\nskills and size at 54 months. Although gesture is not the only factor\nmediating language development, evidence strongly suggests that\nexposure to a broader range of embodied interactions determines lexical\nrichness and vocabulary growth. Other findings (Rowe and Goldin-Meadow\n2009b; Rowe et alia 2008;\n Ozçalişkan and\nGoldin-Meadow 2005; Iverson and\nGoldin-Meadow 2005; Acredolo and Goodwyn 1988) point in the same\ndirection: parents who gesture very frequently encourage the child to\ngesture and gesturing may then influence language development. These\nfindings collectively suggest that if learning is body-based and\ncorrelated with nonlinguistic aspects of behavior, then appeals to some\nforms of innateness seem unlikely to account for such features of\nlanguage development. Additional support for the Body as Distributor thesis comes from\ndata showing the role of gestures in reasoning. According to the\nGesture as Simulated Action (GSA) Framework (Hostetter and Alibabi\n2008), gestures derive from mental simulations of actions and\nperceptual states that people utilize when thinking, and they affect\nthe cognitive mechanisms in service of mental imagery, judgment and\nproblem solving by raising activation of sensorimotor areas (see\nAlibabi et alia 2014 for a recent discussion). \n\nIt should be clear that no form of the Embodiment Thesis denies the\nbiological grounds of language processes and cognitive activity. What\nit challenges is the adequacy of current research programs that\ncontinue to build heavily on the idea that language and cognitive\ndevelopment rely on processes and mechanisms that are domain-specific\nand causally powerful. Embodied cognitive science has generated\nevidence that suggests that non-neural structures are not merely\nsecondary resources. Rather, they variously foster, constitute, and\ndetermine the acquisition and development of specific psychological\ncapacities, including those operant in language and perceptual\nprocessing. \n\nIn this section, we focus on five empirical domains in which an\nembodied perspective has motivated novel insights about cognition and\nthe mind: visual consciousness, concepts, memory, the understanding of\nother minds, and moral cognition. We limit discussion to these five\ntopics for reasons of space and clarity, not because these are the only\nfive to which these theoretical tools can be fruitfully applied (see\nGibbs 2006 for an extensive presentation and discussion of a wider\nrange of applications).  Visual consciousness is typically\nviewed as a process within the brain. Yet the issues about the\nrelationship between conscious experience and neural structures are\nempirically and philosophically controversial. Brain plasticity, for\nexample, provides some reason to think that there could be different\nneural substrates for a given conscious visual experience, both within\nthe same individual at different times, or different individuals at the\nsame time. And even if one assumes that brain states alone suffice for\nvisual conscious experience (‘the minimal substrate thesis’\nfor short), one might still wonder whether neural correlates of visual\nconsciousness systematically match the content of perceptual\nexperience. While a considerable number of neuroscientists seem to\nshare the commitment to the matching-content doctrine, the literature\non the neural correlates of consciousness, as Noë and Thompson\n(2004) point out, says very little, if anything, to prove that neural\nstates match visual conscious experience in content. \nHence, while seemingly obvious, upon closer examination the\nbrain-centered view (endorsed by prominent scholars, such as Koch\n2004; Chalmers 2000; Metzinger 2000; Crick and Koch 1990, 1998; Crick\n1996) appears problematic. Defenders of embodied cognition (most\nnotably Noë and Thompson 2004; Noë, 2004; O'Regan and\nNoë, 2001; Thompson and Varela, 2001; Hurley, 1998;) advance\nseveral arguments to cast doubt on the matching-content doctrine and\nthe minimal substrate thesis. One argument concerns the\nincommensurability of the features of the content of visual\nexperience. Whereas the content of a visual experience is\nexperiential—that is, represented from a point of view, active\nand attentional—none of these properties seem to be ascribable\nto the content of a neural representational system (Noë and\nThompson 2004). Roughly put, while animals and people experience the\nworld relative to an egocentric standpoint and, phenomenologically\nspeaking, attend to portions of it that can be revealed and explored\nthrough appropriate movements of the head and body, neurons do not\n(Noë 2004; O'Regan and Noë 2001). Just as the sense of our\nvisual conscious experience depends on our implicit mastery of\nsensorimotor contingencies—a set of rules concerning how sensory\nstimulation varies as a function of movement—conscious visual\nexperience is a temporary pattern of skillful activity. It is\nsomething we do (Noë and O'Regan 2002). (A thorough analysis of\nthe meaning of this claim, which affords at least two main\ninterpretations, one radical and one moderate, along with a review of\nthe debate it generated, can be found in Loughlin 2014, O’Regan\n2011, Noe 2010, Shapiro 2010, Hickerson 2007). Whether or not these\nauthors are right, their claim is significant, as it urges\nneuroscientists and philosophers to pursue a rather different approach\nto understanding the basis of visual consciousness (Gangopadhyay,\nMadary, and Spicer, 2010). \nTwo striking, experimentally-generated phenomena that indicate\nsurprising dimensions to the limitations of our explicit visual\nknowledge have been invoked in support of embodied views of visual\nconsciousness. The first of these, change-blindness (Levins and Simons\n1997), occurs when changes to a visual scene are coordinated with the\nshort periods during which a subject is saccading; the second,\ninattentional blindness (Mack and Rock 1998; Simons and Chambris 1999),\nwhen such changes occur while subjects are engaged in an\nattention-intensive task. Under such conditions, subjects can fail to\nreport noticing even massive and (to other observers) striking changes\nto a visual scene, such as the appearance of a dancing gorilla walking\nthrough the middle of the scene. \nThese phenomena call into question the traditional assumption that the\nbrain reconstructs detailed and accurate internal models of the visual\nfield. This assumption, while widespread, has obscured two important\npoints, each motivating a shift to an embodied perspective on vision:\n \nThat subjects are usually capable of noticing large changes to, and\nunexpected elements in, the visual field, show several things. Most\nimportantly for present purposes, visual conscious experience is a\nskillful engagement with the world and heavily depends on what we\ndo with our eyes, head and body to bring something into visual\nconsciousness. This implies that we must ‘do’ something in\norder to engage in a conscious experience, and only by way of our\nbodily movements can attentional processes be directed to the\nenvironment. Thus, body and world not only matter as sources of causal\ninfluence, but act as non-neural substrates of the machinery realizing\nthe enactment of visual consciousness. \nGiven the current state of neuroscience, the conclusion that phenomenal\nexperience cannot be explained by processes in the head seems hard to\naccept (Block 2005). Distributed consciousness has inescapable\nconsequences. One might assume, for example, that if two people with\nthe same internal states were in different environments, their\nconscious experience would be different and that a brain in a vat would\nnot have any visual conscious experience, because a brain in a vat has\nno body and accordingly cannot interact with the environment as we\nnormally do. \nRegardless of how convincing these arguments are, the genuine insight\nabout the nature of consciousness that embodied cognitive science has\ngenerated is that the character of visual experience results from the\nway we are dynamically hooked up to the world. Sensorimotor coupling\nwith the environment is crucial in providing the organism with the\nproprioceptive/kinesthetic feedback necessary for the sense of\nownership of movement. When we touch an object, for example, we do not\nexclusively have experience of it, but while touching and being\ntouched we experience ourselves moving, including the feeling of\ncontrolling our own body in action. The account that agency (the sense\nof controlling one's own body) originates in processes that evolved\nfor interaction with the environment—that is, mechanisms for\nsensory processing and motor control (Tsakiris et alia 2007; Berti et\nalia 2005; Haggard 2005; Farrer et alia 2003; Leube et alia 2003;\nFarrer and Frith 2002; Chaminade and Decety, 2002)—suggests that\nembodied experience underpins self awareness. For a recent contrasting, yet embodied, account of agency and its\nrelated disorders refer to work in phenomenological psychiatry (Fuchs\n2011, 2010, 2009, 2005; Sass and Parnas 2001; Stanghellini\n2004). Here, Frith’s (1992) attempt to ‘neuralizing’\nconsciousness, subjectivity and agency by causally tracing them back\nto neurophysiological correlates is challenged by a view that places\nstrong emphasis on the notion of “lived corporality”. \nConsistent with the view that consciousness and action may be closely\nrelated, brain imaging studies have shown that delusions of control,\noften seen in schizophrenic patients, are associated with a failure in\nthe mechanism by which the predicted consequences of an action are\nlinked to the intended sequence of motor commands (Frith et alia 2000).\nDeficits of this kind suggest that the ability to control and hold\nconscious thoughts may recruit the same mechanisms employed in\ninteractions with the\nenvironment.  A common assumption in traditional\naccounts is that concepts are context-independent amodal symbols. There\nare several problems with this view and research is strong in\nsuggesting that conceptual capacities incorporate and are structured in\nterms of patterns of bodily activity. Talking or thinking about objects\nhave been suggested to imply the reactivation of previous experiences,\nand the recruitment of the same neural circuits involved during\nperception and action towards those objects would allow the\nre-enactment of multimodal information (color, size, width, etc). In\nprinciple, the view that concepts are represented through abstract\nsymbols, rather than modality specific features, and cognition requires\nstable forms of representation should be either dropped or strongly\nrevisited. \nEvidence reveals that people construct concepts quite differently in\ndistinct contexts (Solomon and Barsalou 2001; Wisniewski 1998; Medin\nand Shoben 1988; Barsalou and Ross 1986), and conceptualization can\nvary across individuals and be different for the same individual in\ndistinct occasions. When subjects are asked to provide definitions for\ncategories, like bird and chair (see Barsalou 1993) only 44% of the\nfeatures in one person's definition exist in another\nperson's definition and a great deal of flexibility exists also\nwithin individuals providing definitions for the same categories two\nweeks later. \n\nAlso the pattern of interaction entertained with an object may\ninfluence the way conceptualization is done. People dealing with\ncertain items and their structural parts more frequently and\nextensively than others will tend to develop representations that\nreflect the nature of their interactions with them. Not surprisingly,\ndistinct tree experts (such as a taxonomist, a landscape worker and a\npark maintenance personnel) will categorize trees in ways that differ\nfrom one other and from non-specialists (Medin et alia 1997). These\nstudies draw upon and reinforce the theory of perceptual symbol\nsystems (Barsalou 1999) and strongly indicate that perceptual and\nmotor mechanisms are engaged when people perform conceptual processing.\nThey also suggest that completely modality-free categories are rare,\nbecause concepts, whether concrete or abstract, are distributed over\nmodality specific domains and involve reactivation of states in\nsensorimotor systems (Boronat et alia 2005; Gallese and Lakoff 2005;\nBarsalou et alia 2003; Tranel et alia 2003; Beauchamp and Martin 2007;\nMartin and Chao 2001; Martin et alia 2000; Pulvermüller 1999;\nMartin et alia 1996). \n\nFurther support for the theory that modalities play a pivotal role in\nconcept representation comes from work on property verification\n(Solomon and Barsalou 2001; Pecher et alia 2003). Property\nverification consists in deciding whether a property in a specific\nmodality fits an object, for example, the auditory\nproperty loud for BLENDER and the visual\nproperty green for APPLE. Findings demonstrated that subjects\nperforming the task responded faster and more accurately when the\nprevious verification was in the same modality (e.g.,\nLEAVES—rustling) rather than in a different modality\n(e.g., CRANBERRIES—tart) (Pecher et alia 2003). The\neffect is explained by assuming that concept representation does not\nactivate the abstract features of an object but uses the same system\nthat is recruited for perception in different modalities. So, if the\nauditory system is used for hearing the sound of a blender, then to\nrun a simulation (that is, form a concept) of the sound of a\nBLENDER the auditory system will be recruited. Slower responses in\ndifferent modalities are associated with cost in switching attention,\nand the effort made in switching modalities speaks against the idea\nthat knowledge is represented in a modality-free manner. Conversely,\nthere should not be any differences between same-modality and\ndifferent-modality conditions. \n\nThe fact that sensorimotor circuits get recruited, or rather,\nre-used for purposes, like concept formation or language\nprocessing, other than those they have been established for, such as\nmotor and sensory information processing, strongly favors modal and\nembodied approaches to cognition over amodal and abstract ones. It also\noffers an alternative perspective on several topics in the sciences of\nthe mind, including the degree of modularity in cortical organization,\nthe development of the brain and the localization hypothesis of\ncognitive functions (see Anderson 2010 for a recent theory of neural\nre-use). \n\nWhile these findings have provoked revisions to traditional\naccounts, the specific conclusion that sensorimotor processes are\nphysically constitutive of conceptual processing has not been\nuniversally accepted on the grounds that the data are consistent with\ndifferent theories (see Mahon and Caramazza 2008; Rupert 2009b:\nch.9–10). Consider the case of remembering how tools\nand ingredients are displayed in the kitchen in order to instruct\nsomeone to bake a cake. Traditional accounts would claim that\ninformation storage and retrieval should be featured as essentially\nindependent from sensorimotor mechanisms. However, it does not seem\nfrom empirical evidence that remembering appeals to the semantic\nrelatedness of ingredients and tool but rather consists of forming an\nimage revealing where ingredients and tools are located as a function\nof our imagined movement throughout the kitchen. The location itself\nserves as external aid to memory and imagined embodied actions within\nthe location afford the retrieval of information that help figure out\nwhat is needed to bake a cake (Cole et alia 1997). That the time needed\nto recall and retrieve information is constrained by the imaged spatial\nlayout with reference to the observer's body has been shown by a\ndifferent set of studies (Bryant and Wright 1999; see also Waller et\nalia 2008; Nori et alia 2004; McNamara 2003; Waller et alia 2002). \n\nEmbodiment effects on memory have been also found in accomplishing\nparticular tasks, including reasoning and language understanding, and\nseveral recent works suggest that memory reflects different bodily\ncapacities (M. Wilson 2001; Glenberg 1997; Carlson 1997). For instance,\nhand-arm movements, that often accompany speech, do not play a mere\ncommunicative role but facilitate the maintenance of spatial\nrepresentations in working memory (Wesp et alia 2001) and recalling\nenacted action-phrases is significantly easier with respect to purely\nverbal encoding (see Engelkamp, 1998 for a review). This effect\nsuggests that motor information may have become part of the memory\ntrace, thus indicating that action-phrases merely heard do not produce\nthe same effective encoding of real enacted action-sentences. Empirical\nliterature also supports the hypothesis that the memory trace includes\nthe body posture in which the experience was acquired (Barsalou et alia\n2003). Drawing on congruent-posture and incongruent-posture conditions,\nbehavioral data have shown that the body contains the cue to recall\nautobiographical events and the retrieval of a memory of a past\nexperience gets facilitated if the body posture assumed during that\nexperience is reassumed (Dijkstra et alia 2007). Further evidence of\nthe body's constraining capacities has been provided by Presson\nand Montello (1994). In this experiment subjects were first asked to\nmemorize the location of objects in a room and then, while blindfolded,\nwere asked to point to the objects. Pointing was fast and accurate.\nWhile some subjects were then asked to imagine rotating 90° and to\npoint to the objects again, the others were asked to actually rotate\n90° and to point to the objects. In this second half of the\nexperiment, pointing was slow and inaccurate only for those who\nimagined the rotation. A recent, informative survey of memory-related empirical phenomena,\nwhich also explains in what sense memory can be understood as an\nembodied skill, namely, a process incorporating bodily experience, can\nbe found in Sutton and Williamson (2014). Folk psychology is the commonsense\nunderstanding we have of one another in terms of internal mental\nstates, such as beliefs and desires, that in combination can be used to\npredict and explain human behaviour. The traditional perspective on\nunderstanding folk psychology presupposes that our attributional\ntendencies here are generated by an internal theory (Premack and\nWoodruff 1978), and on some versions of this “theory\ntheory” view of folk psychology, this internal theory is executed\nby a theory of mind module in the brain (Leslie 1987). Opponents of\nthis view, simulation theorists, minimize the role played by the kind\nof abstract theorizing typical of theories, and question whether such a\ntheory of mind module exists. They argue that discoveries and findings\nfrom neuroscience are consistent with the approach that sees social\ncognition as a form of body-based simulation, and conceives of bodily\nstates as the building blocks of intersubjectivity (Oberman and\nRamachandran 2007; Iacoboni and Dapretto 2006; Rizzolatti and Craighero\n2004; Ferrari et alia 2003; Rizzolatti et alia 2001; Umiltà et\nalia 2001; Gallese and Goldman 1998; Rizzolatti and Arbib 1998). \n\nThe discovery of mirror neurons in macaques and humans–cells\nwith sensorimotor properties that fire both when performing an action\nand when observing the very same action executed by other\nindividuals—has been seized on by simulation theorists and other\nopponents of the theory-theory view in support of their preferred\nexplanatory frameworks. (For critical evaluations of fMRI and PET\nstudies aiming to show the presence of a mirror neuron system in humans\nsee Turella et alia 2009; see also Hickok 2008.) \nIndirect evidence in support of a mirror system in humans comes from\nstudies on the reactivity of cerebral rhythm, the posterior alpha\nrhythm and the central mu rhythm, during action observation. While the\nmu rhythm is present during motor rest, it disappears when active\nmovements are performed. Electrophysiological results have shown that\nobserving the action executed by another individual blocks the mu\nrhythm of the observer, thus providing evidence for a resonance\nsystem, which links the observed action to the action of the\nsubject's own motor repertoire (Oberman et alia 2005; Cochin et\nalia 1998; Gastaut and Bert 1954, Cohen-Seat et alia 1954). Another\nbody of evidence in support of the existence of an\nobservation/execution matching system in humans comes from transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation studies (Fadiga et alia 1995). Left motor cortex\nof normal participants was stimulated both during the observation of\nintransitive and goal-directed arm movements. Motor evoked potentials\nwere recorded from various hand muscles. The results showed a selective\nincrease in motor evoked potentials in the regions that participants\nnormally recruit for producing the observed action. That means that\nwhen we observe a person grasping a cup of coffee the very same neural\npopulation that controls the execution of the grasping movement becomes\nactive in the observer's motor areas. \n\nOn this view, it is the embodied imitation of the observed body in\naction that directly enables us to recognize others as persons like\nus, not an abstract, inferential and theory-like process. The\nhypothesis that action understanding is based on a resonance mechanism\ndoes not exclude the possibility that other processes, based on\nmovement descriptions, could influence this function. It simply\nhighlights the primacy of a direct, automatic and prereflexive\nmatching between the observation and the execution of action. By\naccepting this premise the traditional tension between acting and\nthinking considerably shrinks, as the capacity to detect the meaning\nof the behaviors of others consists in employing the same resources\nused to model our motor behavior. A dominant tradition in moral\ntheory for the past several centuries has placed reason at the center\nof moral thought and moral behavior. Kohlberg's cognitive\ndevelopmental work on moral cognition (1969) reflects this spirit.\nKohlberg consistently endorsed, along the lines of classic cognitivism,\na rationalist model in which emotions and body states may be taken into\naccount by reason but it is pure reasoning that ultimately leads to\nmoral decisions. His paradigm inspired most leading studies in the\nfield, all characterized by the common view that cognitive processing\nin the moral domain is disengaged from the economy of emotions and\nbody. \nRecent work in embodied moral cognition challenges this paradigm.\nSocial intuitionist models, for instance, claim that many moral\njudgments appear to be the result of affective components (Greene and\nHaidt 2002; Haidt et alia 1993). Subjects presented with descriptions\nof actions that were harmless but likely to produce a strong affective\nresponse/reaction (e.g., eating one's pet dog after a car killed\nit) often judge the action described by the sentence to be wrong. When\npressed to provide a justification, subjects typically focus on\nnonexistent harms associated with the actions, indicating that\nconscious reasoning is not a good predictor of their judgment of\nwrongness. If affective reactions play a pervasive role in moral\njudgments, a role that escapes (and is in fact masked by) conscious\nreflection, this suggests that moral cognition is shaped and\nconstrained by “gut feelings”, rather than the product of\nabstract reasoning. \nFurther examples supporting the embodied nature of moral cognition come\nfrom the experimental literature that specifically addresses\ndisgust/repugnance (Lerner et alia 2004; Wheatley and Haidt, 2005).\nDisgust involves strong physical components and explicit bodily\nchanges, such as nausea, stomach-turning, throat clenching,\nfood-expulsion, thrusting out of the tongue, and wrinkling of the nose.\nEven if disgust evolved as a food-related reaction indicating that a\nsubstance should be either avoided or expelled, it is also an emotion\nof social rejection, extending its reach and influence into the domain\nof moral cognition (Niedenthal et alia 2005; Prinz 2004). \n\nRecent experiments have shown, for example, that the feeling of\ndisgust induced by the exposure to a bad smell or dirty looking room\nmakes moral judgments more severe (Schnall et alia 2008a), and that\nsubjects who physically cleanse themselves then find certain moral\nactions to be less wrong than do participants not exposed to a\ncleanliness manipulation (Schnall et alia 2008b). These ‘moral\nharshness’ effects may be induced even for moral evaluations of\ncertain issues or groups. In a recent study (Inbar et alia 2009)\nexperimenters found that people reported more negative evaluations\ntowards gays and lesbians when exposed to a noxious odor in the room\nthan when no odor was present. Even anger has been shown to deeply\nshape the representations available to moral judgment. Anger over a\ntraffic incident before going to work may lead to an increased reliance\non prejudice when interviewing a job candidate afterwards (DeSteno et\nalia 2004). Accumulating evidence that perception, emotion and judgment are\ngrounded in sensorimotor mechanisms motivated the body-specificity\nthesis (Casasanto 2011, 2009; de la Vega et alia 2012; Brunyé\net alia 2012), the claim that people with different kinds of bodies\ntend to think differently. Right handers, for example, conceptualize\n“good” and “bad” in terms of motor dominance\nrather than cultural conventions and tend to prefer or make positive\nevaluations of people or objects presented in their right side\n(Casasanto 2014, 2009, Casasanto and Henetz 2012). This space-valence\nimplicit mapping can be manipulated via changes in body- environment\ninteractions. Subjects who lost the use of their dominant hand or wear\na glove that impairs motor fluency show a reversal of their space\n–valence associations (Casasanto and Chrysikou 2011). For a\ndetailed discussion of how affective judgments incorporate patterns of\nbodily interaction with the environment and are constrained by a range\nof embodied capabilities see Casasanto 2014. \nThe empirical literature suggests that the specificity of one's\nown bodily cues and affective reactions (e.g., nausea, arousal) guide\nand constrain cognitive processing in social and moral domains. In\naddition, it suggests that dramatic deficits occur when subjects do not\nexhibit and make use of these cues and reactions. Damasio's\nsomatic marker hypothesis (1994, 1996) claims that bodily states,\nnormally triggered during emotional experiences, are re-enacted\nwhenever certain situations occur or are considered, and such\nre-enaction avoids deleterious consequences of one's course of\naction. When the capacity to integrate these feelings (either positive\nor negative) with one's own knowledge of facts is severely\ncompromised, as is the case in ventro-medial-prefrontal cortex (VMPFC)\npatients, making judgments and decisions is severely impaired. As a\n‘gambling task’ (Bechara et alia 1994) reveals, in the\nabsence of embodied states (e.g., anticipatory skin conductance\nresponse) VMPFC patients miss a fundamental source of information about\nthe possible outcomes associated with different actions (see also\nBechara et alia 2000). If Damasio's hypothesis is correct, then\nthe affective and bodily feedback implicated in various types of moral\njudgment do not simply lead to different understandings and\nconceptualizations of the situation at hand, but are part of the\nphysical machinery realizing cognitive processes. \nWhile we think there is broad empirical support for the idea that\nsensorimotor activity and central cognitive processing are more deeply\ndependent on one another than previously thought, and for the view that\nbodily activity can constrain, distribute, and regulate neural\nactivity, embodied cognitive science has also been invoked in support\nof more radical philosophical ideas about cognition and the mind. For\nexample, as we noted in Section 3, some have argued that embodied\ncognition implies that cognition itself leaks out into the body (and\nultimately the environment (A. Clark 2008). Proponents of the\ntraditional view that cognition is skull-bound have argued, in reply,\nboth that this inference is mistaken and the view it leads to is\nimplausible and metaphysically extravagant (Rupert 2009b; Adams and\nAizawa 2008; Aizawa 2007). We take up such further philosophical issues\nin Section 6 below. \nThe difference that embodied cognition makes to the three issues we\ndiscussed in Section 4—the modularity of mind, the nature of\nmental representation, and nativism about the mind, remains a live\nissue of debate in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science. The\nsame is true of the interpretation of the particular empirical results\ndescribed in Section 5. \n\nWe think that some of these disagreements both reflect and\ncontribute to sharper divides over the significance of embodied\ncognitive science. We discuss four such issues in this concluding\nsection, structuring our discussion around four corresponding\nquestions: \nOur aim here is not to provide extensive answers to these questions,\nbut to indicate briefly what our review of contemporary work on\nembodied cognition indicates about the issues that they raise. We take\neach in turn. Insofar as\nembodied cognitive science has its origins in a variety of\ndissatisfaction with traditional cognitive science, it has explored\nnovel questions about cognition and generated results that have, in\nsome cases, been unexpected. As we have seen in the previous section,\nembodied cognitive science continues to produce empirical research that\nis interesting, novel, and controversial. In this respect, embodied\ncognitive science is not simply (or chiefly) a philosophical mantra\nempty of empirical content, but a cluster of perspectives on cognition\nwhose empirical orientation and rootedness cannot be questioned. \n\nBut there is an alternative position that one might take on this\nquestion that is more circumspect about the empirical payoff of\n“embodied cognition”. While there is no doubt about the\nempirical “oomph” of embodied cognitive science, the extent\nto which this work either challenges traditional views or requires one\nor another of the determinate forms of the Embodiment Thesis that we\narticulated—Body as Constraint, Body as Distributor, and Body as\nRegulator—might be questioned. For example, Lawrence Shapiro\n(2011) has argued that the views of Lakoff and Johnson on metaphor,\nthought, and the body are fully compatible with central tenets of\ntraditional cognitive science, such as the idea that cognition\ncentrally involves computation over internal mental representations\n(see also Shapiro 2010). Robert Rupert (2009b) has argued more\ngenerally for compatibility between the empirical findings of embodied\ncognitive science and the core assumptions of traditional cognitive\nscience. Likewise, Fred Adams (2010) has argued that one should\ndistinguish between the empirical premise in arguments for the\nembodiment of cognition, and a requisite logical-metaphysical premise,\nand that the latter of these is seldom supported. (Adams focuses on\nGlenberg's work on meaning affordances (Glenberg and Kaschak\n2002; see also Glenberg and Robertson 2000, Glenberg et al. 2005), but\nhis claims are quite general). From this perspective, one should sift\nthe empirical wheat of embodied cognitive science from the\nrevolutionary, philosophical chaff that has characterized that movement\nfrom the outset. This issue, in turn, brings us to our next issue. For the most part, questioning whether\nembodied cognitive science delivers on the revolutionary front has\nproceeded not by drawing on general considerations—say, of the\nunderdetermination of theory by data—but by a detailed\nconsideration of particular empirical results (cf. Rupert 2009b: ch.11,\nhowever). By its nature, this kind of argument, which we endorse the\nneed for, is time- and space-consuming, especially given the diversity\nof work that falls under the label “embodied cognition”.\nThis is more so in the evaluation of this type of challenge to\nproponents of embodied cognition. Here we settle for making one general\npoint about the state of the dialectic here, and state where we believe\nthe burden of proof lies. \n\nSuppose that we simply grant the historical claim that the focus and\norientation of traditional cognitive science has not taken cognition to\nbe dependent, in any significant way, on the body. What does this imply\nabout the explanatory power of traditional cognitive science vis-a-vis\nthe Embodiment Thesis? Recall that we have analyzed the Embodiment\nThesis in terms of three determinate theses about the nature of the\ndependence of cognition on the body, each with its own particular\nimplications: \n\nThose seeking to resist the challenge that one or more of these\nviews poses to traditional cognitive science have two primary options:\nto deny the truth of the corresponding thesis, or to reject the\ninference(s) from that thesis to claims about what traditional\ncognitive science can and cannot explain. \n\nDefenders of traditional cognitive science have considerable\ndialectical power available here, and they have made effective use of a\nfamiliar argumentative strategy in resisting the embodied cognition\nchallenge: to grant that there is a weak or limited sense in which one\nor more of these particular embodiment thesis is correct, but argue\nthat the inferential gap between such theses and the rejection of views\nsuch as computationalism and representationalism is not bridgeable\n(Adams 2010, Rupert 2009a, 2009b) a strategy that those critically\nsympathetic to embodied cognitive science have also made effective use\nof (e.g., Shapiro 2010, 2011). To this extent, the burden of proof\ncurrently lies squarely with proponents of embodied cognitive science\nwho hold that the revolutionary promise of embodied cognition is real\nto show how those gaps can be bridged. One such putatively radical implication of embodied\ncognition is the Extended Mind Thesis, which says that an agent's\nmind and associated cognitive processing are neither skull-bound nor\neven body-bound, but extend into the agent's world. Unlike the\nEmbodiment Thesis, this thesis arose via more explicitly\nphilosophically-driven discussions—of functionalism (Harman\n1988), of computationalism and individualism (R. Wilson 1994, 1995:\nch.3–4), and of belief (Clark and Chalmers 1998). It thus bears a\ndifferent kind of relationship to empirical work in cognitive science\nthan does the idea of embodied cognition. Despite the legacies of these\ndifferent histories, as we noted in Section 1, embodied cognition and\nextended cognition have recently come to be viewed as peas in the same\npod, as variants of situated cognitive science. \n\nThe first point to draw attention to is that nothing in any of the\nthree determinate forms of the Embodiment Thesis entails the extended\nmind thesis. Thus, the view that cognition is embodied (in some\nspecific sense: constrained, distributed, or regulated) is compatible\nwith the denial of the view that cognition is extended. Expressed in\nterms of the Body as Distributor thesis, perhaps cognitive processing\nis distributed by the body across neural and non-neural resources, but\nall of the relevant non-neural resources are contained within the\nboundaries of the body. We believe that this is the position\noccupied by the core of the embodied cognitive science community. (For\nexample, Barsalou's recent [2008] review paper on “grounded\ncognition”, which completely omits mention of any the large\nphilosophical literature on extended cognition, is indicative of this\nstate of affairs.) \n\nSecond, many of the most influential defenses of the extended mind\nthesis appeal to considerations only tangentially related to the\nbody—to computationalism and individualism (R. Wilson 1994), to\ndistributed and group-level cognition (Hutchins 1995), to parity\nprinciples (Clark and Chalmers 1998), to realization (R. Wilson 2001,\n2004: ch.5–6). For this reason, debate over those arguments and the\nextended view of the mind they putatively support have only recently\nbecome conjoined by advocates (R. Wilson 2010; A. Clark 2003, 2008) and\ncritics (Adams and Aizawa 2008; Rupert 2009b) alike. This recent, joint\nconsideration is of mutual benefit to discussions of both embodied and\nextended cognition. \n\nThus, and third, despite their independence, some have claimed that\nthe most powerful arguments for one of these views also provide strong\nreasons to accept the other. For example, Andy Clark (2008) argues from\nthe active embodiment of cognition to the extended mind thesis.\nSimilarly, some of the most trenchant objections to one of these views\nwould also appear also to serve as the basis for rejecting the other.\nFor example, critics of the extended mind thesis, such as Adams and\nAizawa (2008) and Rupert (2004, 2009b), have objected that those\narguing for the thesis have confused or elided the distinction between\nexternal causes of cognition and external constituents\nof cognition. This charge of committing a\n“coupling-constitution fallacy” is also readily made\nagainst particular embodied cognition views, such as Alva\nNöe's (2004) view that perceptual experience is constituted\nby sensorimotor abilities (see Prinz 2009; Aizawa 2007; Rupert 2006;\nBlock 2005). While there may be relevant differences between embodied\nand extended cognition that imply that such arguments and objections do\nnot transfer, there are at least default, parity considerations that\nput the burden of proof on those claiming those differences. \n\nFourth, there may be deeper reasons for thinking that embodied and\nextended cognition stand or fall together. Rupert (2009b), for example,\nhas recently argued against both embodied and extended cognition in\npart by making a positive case for what he calls the cognitive\nsystems view of the boundaries of cognition, and that this view\nsuggests, together with our best empirical science, that cognition\nbegins and ends in the brain. If Rupert is correct, then cognition is\nneither embodied nor extended because both views are incompatible with\nan independently-motivated account of the brain-bound nature of\nintegrated cognitive architectures. \n\nConversely, in laying out a general conception of situated cognition\nas cognitive extension, Wilson and Clark (2009) claimed that\n“many forms of embodied cognition, properly understood, will turn\nout to involve just the kinds of cognitive extension that we articulate\nhere” (p.56), a promissory note that one of us (R. Wilson 2010)\nhas attempted to cash in offering the following explicit argument tying\ntogether embodied and extended cognition: \n\nClearly, as the premise that explicitly draws a connection between\nthe Embodiment and Extended Mind theses, (4) is where this argument is\nlikely to be scrutinized by those skeptical of the conclusion to this\nargument. Whether that can be done while accepting (1)–(3),\nhowever, is unclear and the kind of issue that requires further\nattention in this debate. If the mind\nis not skull-bound but at least embodied, and perhaps even extended,\nthen what view should we adopt of the self, subjectivity, and\nconsciousness? The penultimate paragraph to Clark and Chalmers (1998)\nadvocated the view that, to put it colloquially, where mind goes, the\nself follows: if the mind is extended, for example, so too is the self\n(see also A. Clark 2001, 2003). Since much of what matters to the\nidentity of one's self is cognitive in nature, at least on\ntraditional views of the self and personal identity, this\n“self-follows-mind” view seems a natural default. \n\nIf the boundaries of the self shift with those of the mind out from\nskull to body, or even from body to world, as the self-follows-mind\nview implies, then accepting embodied or extended cognition will have\ninteresting implications concerning autonomy, sociality, personal\nidentity, and responsibility. For example, it might be that in some\ncases interfering with someone's peripersonal space, the space\nclose to the body, or even certain of one's belongings, will have\na comparable moral significance as interfering with a person's\nbody. And as Clark and Chalmers (1998) suggested in their final\nparagraph, certain forms of social activity might be reconceived as a\nkind of thought activity. The social distribution of human\ndecision-making would also mitigate individual's responsibility\nfor a transgression, thereby producing dramatic ramifications for our\npractices of attributing legal culpability. In effect, if situational\nforces and environmental contingences played a physically constitutive\nrole in decision-making processes so as to become partial realizers of\none's own behavior, as the so called ‘Frail Control\nHypothesis’ seems to suggest (see Churchland and Suhler 2009 for\ncritics to this view), then human beings would have little if any\ncontrol over their actions and presumably no normative competence. \n\nAgainst the self-follows-mind view, Wilson (2004: 141-143) has\nargued that even if one accepts that the mind is extended, there are\nreasons to resist the idea that the self is likewise extended. This\nresistance turns on precisely the kinds of implications indicated\nabove, and their often radical, deeply counter-intuitive, and puzzling\nconsequences. For example, if subjects of cognition (or agents, or\nindividuals) are themselves distributed across brain, body, and world,\nthen why should we punish just one bit of this individual, the bit\ninside the body, when it commits a crime? (Consider this a truncated\nreductio.) More generally, while agents as the subjects of\ncognition are not just a bundle of neural circuits and bodily\nexperience, re-casting agency and subjectivity within the extended\nframework likely requires a far more comprehensive and somewhat uneasy\nreconceptualization of notions such as normative competence, freedom\nand control, and personal identity. Perhaps this simply tells us that\nmuch further exploration is needed concerning how embodied experiences\nin real-world contexts shape cognitive processing. Or perhaps it\nsuggests that more conservative strategies should be employed to\naccount for what the subjects of cognitive processing really are. \n\nOne such strategy is to appeal to the ready-made distinction between\nthe subject or agent of cognition, which can be readily\nidentified as being where the locus of control for a given cognitive\nsystem is, housed in the agent's body, and the cognitive\nsystems in which cognitive processing is realized, which are often\nextended (R. Wilson 2004, ch.5–6). Such a distinction is put to\nantecedent use in making sense of extended biological systems,\nsuch as spiders and the webs they spin—these organisms are\nbounded, roughly speaking, by their cohesive, organic bodies, but still\nact in the world through the extended biological systems they construct\n(R. Wilson 2005, ch.1–4). Thus, an appeal to this distinction here is\nnot ad hoc, and provides a principled basis for a more conservative,\ntraditional view of agency and the self within an extended cognition\nframework.","contact.mail":"rwilson.robert@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"2011-07-25","date.changed":"2015-12-08","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/","author1":"Robert A.

Proponents of embodied cognitive science\nview this as a serious mistake. Sometimes the nature of the dependence\nof cognition on the body is quite unexpected, and suggests new ways of\nconceptualizing and exploring the mechanics of cognitive\nprocessing.\n\n\n\nEmbodied cognitive science encompasses a loose-knit family of\nresearch programs in the cognitive sciences that often share a\ncommitment to critiquing and even replacing traditional approaches to\ncognition and cognitive processing. Empirical research on embodied\ncognition has exploded in the past 10 years. As the bibliography for\nthis article attests, the various bodies of work that will be discussed\nrepresent a serious alternative to the investigation of cognitive\nphenomena.\n\n\n\nRelatively recent work on the embodiment of cognition provides much\nfood for thought for empirically-informed philosophers of mind. This is\nin part because of the rich range of phenomena that embodied cognitive\nscience has studied. But it is also in part because those phenomena are\noften thought to challenge dominant views of the mind, such as the\ncomputational and representational theories of mind, at the heart of\ntraditional cognitive science. And they have sometimes been taken to\nundermine standard positions in the philosophy of mind, such as the\nidea that the mind is identical to, or even realized in, the brain.\n\n\n\nConsider four evocative examples of phenomena that have motivated\nembodied cognitive science.  \nAlthough phenomena such as (1)–(4) motivate embodied\ncognitive science, appealing to such phenomena to arrive at more\nsubstantive conclusions that have been drawn—for example, that\ntraditional cognitive science is deeply flawed, or that dominant\npositions in the philosophy of mind, such as functionalism, are\nmistaken—requires further philosophical argument. Because the\nrequisite argumentation typically appeals to other concepts central to\nwork in empirically-informed philosophy of mind and cognitive science\nitself, such as modularity and nativism, debate over embodied cognition\nhas become a hot topic in cognitive science in recent years (Adams\n2010; Aizawa 2007; Chemero 2009; Shapiro 2011). \n\nTraditional cognitive science has certainly conceptualized central\ncognitive processing, what we will call cognition in the\nnarrow sense, in abstraction from bodily mechanisms of sensory\nprocessing and motor control. Research programs within artificial\nintelligence exemplify this view of cognition in the narrow sense, and\nthey have been one of the clearest targets of embodied cognitive\nscience. More positively, embodied cognitive science aims to understand\nthe full range of perceptual, cognitive, and motor capacities we\npossess, cognition in the broad sense, as capacities that are\ndependent upon features of the physical body. In this article, we\nconsider cognition construed both narrowly and broadly, in these\nsenses. \n\nFinally by way of introducing embodied cognitive science, we note\nits relationship to situated cognition (Smith 1999, Robbins\nand Aydede 2009). As a paradigm within situated cognition, embodied\ncognitive science can be distinguished from both the study of\nembedded cognition and the thesis of extended\ncognition. \n\nEmbodied cognitive science appeals to the idea that cognition deeply\ndepends on aspects of the agent's body other than the brain.\nWithout the involvement of the body in both sensing and acting,\nthoughts would be empty, and mental affairs would not exhibit the\ncharacteristics and properties they do. Work on embedded cognition, by\ncontrast, draws on the view that cognition deeply depends on the\nnatural and social environment. By focusing on the strategies organisms\nuse to off-load cognitive processing onto the environment, this work\nplaces particular emphasis on the ways in which cognitive activity is\ndistributed across the agent and her physical, social, and cultural\nenvironment (Suchman 1987, Hutchins 1995). The thesis of extended\ncognition is the claim that cognitive systems themselves extend beyond\nthe boundary of the individual organism. On this view, features of an\nagent's physical, social, and cultural environment can do more than\ndistribute cognitive processing: they may well partially constitute\nthat agent's cognitive system. (Clark and Chalmers 1998, R. Wilson\n2004; A. Clark 2008, Menary 2010). \n\nWe follow recent authors (A. Clark 2008; Rupert 2009b; Shapiro 2010,\n2011) in holding that while embodied cognitive science can be neatly\ndistinguished, in principle, from both of these other forms of situated\ncognition, and that there are times when this is useful (even crucial),\nthe broader philosophical issues in play are also revealingly discussed\nsometimes by considering these views together. Thus, although this\narticle focuses on the specific ways in which cognition depends on the\nphysical body, it also discusses situated cognition more generally, as\nappropriate. \nA consideration (Sections 2.1–2.3) of three landmark\npublications provides a historical anchor for understanding early work\non embodied cognition in the narrow sense: George Lakoff and Mark\nJohnson's Metaphors We Live By (1980), the enactive\nperspective on cognition developed by Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson,\nand Eleanor Rosch in their The Embodied Mind (1991); and work\non robotics and computationally intelligent action summarized and\nanalyzed in Andy Clark's Being There: Putting Mind, World,\nand Body Back Together (1997). We then turn more briefly to\ninfluential work on embodied cognition in the broad sense (Sections 2.4–2.5) and on the phenomenological tradition within continental\nphilosophy that has inspired more recent embodied cognitive science\n(Section 2.6). \nFigurative language\nclearly plays a role in cognition, and philosophers, linguists, and\npsychologists have all contributed to its understanding in cognitive\nscience (Black 1962; Ortony 1979). Beginning in their Metaphors We\nLive By (1980), George Lakoff and Mark Johnson argued that such\nlanguage, and metaphor in particular, was not simply a phenomenon to be\nstudied in the domain of cognition, but actively structures much of\ncognition traditionally thought to be isolated from metaphor. For\nexample, many central cognitive processes, such as those concerning\nspace and time, were, claimed Lakoff and Johnson, both expressed and\ninfluenced by metaphor (hence “metaphors we live by”). If\nhuman experience is intricately bound up with large-scale metaphors,\nand both experience and metaphor are shaped up by the kinds of bodies\nwe have that mediate between agent and world, argued Lakoff and\nJohnson, then cognition is embodied in a way not anticipated within\ntraditional cognitive science. \nAlthough Lakoff (1987) and Johnson (1987) developed the basic idea here\nin different ways (see also Lakoff and Johnson 1999, Johnson 2007), the\ngeneral flavor of the view they share can be conveyed by considering a\nwell-known example they discuss: that of love as a kind of journey.\nThose in a romantic relationship are often said to head off together,\ntravel the same path, take wrong turns, retrace their steps, check\ntheir bearings, and pack their bags. For Lakoff and Johnson, this\nnon-literal language is not merely peripheral expression useful for\nadding bells and whistles to the bustle of communication, but reflects\nsomething deep about how love is conceptualized. Importantly, the\ncentral organizing metaphor—love is a journey—involves a\nmapping from one domain (journeys) to another (love), where the source\ndomain is informed by our bodily physicality and the embodied\nexperience that we have as creatures who move through the world to\nachieve purposes and goals. \n\nSpatial concepts, such as “front”, “back”,\n“up”, and “down”, provide perhaps the clearest\nexamples in which such embodied experience exists. These concepts are\narticulated in terms of our body's position in, and movement\nthrough, space. Creatures like us that stand upright and move forward,\nfor example, think of things that are “in front of”\nthemselves as located in the line of vision or in terms of the\ndirection they are moving. Creatures that were long and flat and moved\nbackwards, by contrast, might have a very different concept of\n“in front of”, or perhaps none at all. Likewise for other\nspatial concepts, such as “up”. We might get a first-hand\nfeel for the embodied nature of such concepts in situations when we\napproximate such creatures, such as when we try to use such concepts to\nguide our action when we are laying down, moving backwards, or even\nlooking in a rear-vision mirror. The experience of\n“upness”, proponents of embodied cognition claim, depends\non the particular kind of body we have, and how that body interacts\nwith its surroundings (Lakoff and Johnson 1999). \nThis example can also be used to illustrate why embodied cognition has\nproven to be a contentious view within cognitive science and the\nphilosophy of mind. One might argue that the dependence between our\nspatial concepts and our bodies identified above is mundane and\nunremarkable. Consider the best-known of classic mind-body dualists,\nRené Descartes. In his famous quip in Meditation VI, that he (his mind,\nfor Descartes) was not merely lodged in his body “like a pilot in\na ship”, Descartes clearly recognizes that there is some sense in\nwhich cognition depends on, and is integrated with, the body.\nProponents of embodied cognition must, minimally, show that\n“front” and “up” depend on the body in some\nsense that Descartes would deny. \n\nOf more relevance to contemporary debates, proponents of embodied\ncognition must show that this dependence cannot be accommodated within\ntraditional cognitive science and its working commitments (e.g., to the\ncomputational and representational theories of mind). At least this is\ntrue if embodied cognition is to mark a significant departure from, and\npose a substantive challenge to, traditional cognitive science and\nassociated philosophical views of the mind. And that requires,\nminimally, not only identifying some kind of dependence or other\nbetween cognition and the body, but specifying the nature of that\ndependence. \nThe book The Embodied\nMind (Varela, Thompson and Rosch 1991) was an attempt to re-direct\nthe cognitive sciences by infusing them with the phenomenological\nperspective developed in the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1945).\n(More ambitiously, and less successfully, it also aimed to integrate\ncognitive science with Buddhist philosophy; the book also included some\npassing discussion of psychoanalysis.) Varela, Thompson and Rosch\nargued that the standard division between pre-given, external features\nof the world and internal symbolic representations should be dropped,\nas it is unable to accommodate the feedback from embodied actions to\ncognition via the actions of a situated cognitive agent. The\nfundamental differences between their perspective and classical views\nlies in the answers to the questions of what cognition is, how it\nworks, and when a system functions adequately. \nTraditional accounts basically state that there are no computations\nwithout representations, and view cognition as successfully\nfunctioning when any device can support and manipulate symbols to\nsolve the problem given to the system. Varela, Thompson, and Rosch\nintroduced the concept of enaction to present and develop a\nframework that places strong emphasis on the idea that the experienced\nworld is portrayed and determined by mutual interactions between the\nphysiology of the organism, its sensorimotor circuit and the\nenvironment. Their emphasis on the structural coupling of\nbrain-body-world constitutes the kernel of their program of embodied\ncognition, building on the classical phenomenological idea that\ncognitive agents bring forth a world by means of the activity of\ntheir situated living bodies. As the metaphor of\n“bringing forth a world” of meaningful experience implies,\non this view knowledge emerges through the primary agent's bodily\nengagement with the environment, rather than being simply determined\nby and dependent upon either pre-existent situations or personal\nconstruals. \nOne implication of this view is that only a creature with certain\nfeatures—e.g., eyes, hands, legs, and skills—can possess\ncertain kinds of cognitive capacities. This is because cognition is a\ndynamic sensorimotor activity, and the world that is given and\nexperienced is not only conditioned by the neural activity of the\nsubject, but is essentially enacted in that it emerges through the\nbodily activities of the organism. This general approach encourages a\nview of enaction as essentially distinct from computation, as it is\ntraditionally conceived. Varela, Thompson, and Rosch's most detailed\nillustration of their perspective is contained in their discussion of\ncolor experience and categorization, a discussion that received much\nattention in other venues (e.g., Thompson, Palacios, and Varela 1992;\nThompson 1995), typically without reference to the more sweeping\nclaims about embodiment, phenomenology, and Buddhism made in\nThe Embodied Mind (see also Thompson 2007). \nSince its origin, the enactive tradition has grown and enriched in\nvarious ways and each of its strands, though sharing a common\nframework with neighbouring accounts in embodied cognitive science,\nhas developed one’s own theoretical trait and explored a conceptual\nterritory that differentiates them from one another. One variant,\nbranded autopoietic enactivism, has developed in particular the\nbiological phenomenon of autopoiesis and attributed to it a central\nrole in explaining fundamental properties of our mental life (Maturana\nand Varela 1992; Thompson 2005; Di Paolo and Thompson 2014). The\nnotion of autopoiesis describes living systems as active, adaptive,\nself-maintaining and self-individuating, that is, as having the\nproperty of self-reproducing through self-regulating strategies.\nAnother variant, the so-called sensorimotor enactivism, has taken a\nmore liberal route and, rather than stressing the role of autopoietic\norganization in the living systems, it draws on the implicit grasp of\nsensorimotor dependencies (that is, the way in which stimulation\nchanges contingent upon actions of the organisms) to explain conscious\nexperience and a broad range of behaviors (Noe 2004; O’Regan 2011,\nDegenaar and O’Regan forthcoming), Yet another, has gone as radical as\nto say that cognition and experience does not depend on autopoietic\norganization and sensorimotor accounts remain committed to mentalism\nand representationalist thinking (Hutto and Myin’s 2013). In sum,\nalthough these respective varieties are broadly consonant, they come\nto emphasize different features, and internal tensions motivated a\nwiden fragmentation and various forms of elaboration and\nextension. Though we refer to other venues for a thorough discourse on\nthe demarcation line between varieties of enactive proposals (Degenaar\nand O’Regan forthcoming, Menary 2006, Hutto and Myin 2013), here we\nwill limit ourselves to a high-level overview of some reasons for\ntheir disagreement.  One such reason concerns the role ascribed to the\nnotion of autopoiesis.  Whereas the programme that issues from Varela,\nThompson and Rosch maintains that autopoiesis (or self-production) is\na necessary precondition for experience, leading to the idea that\nthere is a deep continuity of life and mind (Thompson 2007) and that\nconsciousness is a particular form of life, both sensorimotor\nenactivism and its radical formulation do not put autopoietic\nprocesses center-stage and do not commit to the view that cognitive\nphenomena build upon peculiar aspects of the organization of living\norganisms (Degenaar and O’Regan forthcoming, Hutto and Myin 2013).  A\nfurther reason for disagreement concerns the rendering of the claim\nthat perceptual experience requires mediating know-how. Whereas\nsensorimotor enactivism advocates that perceptual experience is made\npossible by the possession and skillful exercise of practical\nknowledge of sensorimotor contingencies, the other variants consider\nthe talk of mediating knowledge as a brand of cognitivism (Hutto and\nMyin 2013), somewhat consistent with the theory of mind that grounds\ntraditional cognitive science. In its radical expression, the enactive\nthinking maintains that mentality is to be explained in terms of\ndirect environment-involving embodied engagements. By the early 1990s, work in\ncomputational intelligence had started to explore ways of generating\nintelligent action in robots that shortly became known as the embodied\napproach to robotics. In a pair of papers Rodney Brooks (1991a, 1991b)\nhad presented a general and accessible overview of a new kind of\nintelligent computational architecture, subsumption architecture, that\nwas representation-lite and world-driven. In these respects, it\ndeparted from the representation-crunching intensive traditional views\nof planning and decision-making that had characterized classic AI and\nwas characterized by Brooks as providing “intelligence without\nrepresentation”. Together with computational work by Agre and\nChapman (1987) and Suchman (1987), Brooks's approach suggested a\nview of computational intelligence in which control was governed\nbottom-up by behavior and interaction with the world, rather than by\nplentiful and often complicated internal algorithms and\nrepresentations. \nThe sweep of work in reactive or behavior-based robotics, and its\nidentification as marking a part of the embodied cognitive science, was\nheralded in Andy Clark's Being There: Putting Mind, World,\nand Body Back Together (1997). Clark here provided an integrative\nframework for a wide-range of emerging work on embodiment in the\ncognitive sciences. The big idea in Being There, one with\nlasting impact in embodied cognitive science, is that minds are not for\nthinking, traditionally conceived, but for doing, for getting\nthings done in the world in real time. Rather than developing\n“walking encyclopedias”, robotics in the late 1980s and\nearly 1990s was starting to focus on the dynamic interaction between\nbody and world. Clark drew out affinities between this shift in the\nconception of intelligent action in computational systems and the\nemergence of the idea that cognition was scaffolded, embedded, and\nextended. \n\nThe work we have briefly recounted so far all concerns what we\ncalled cognition in the narrow sense, processes like human memory,\ncategorization, and language processing (Lakoff and Johnson), human and\nnonhuman color categorization (Varela, Thompson, and Rosch), and\ndecision-making and planning in robots and robotic systems (Clark). But\nembodied cognitive science aims to encompass cognition broadly\nconstrued. To convey the flavor of early work here, we briefly consider\nthe work of James Gibson on perception, and Esther Thelen and Linda\nSmith (1994) on infant walking and reaching behaviors (cf. Shapiro\n2011). \nJames Gibson's\n(1979) account of vision challenged the idea that the central problem\nthat the visual system has to solve is how to reconstruct a full-blown,\nthree-dimensional world from the information specified in the\ntwo-dimensional image on the retina. That idea has been prominent in\ntraditional, information processing views of vision, including those of\nRock (1983, 1997), Richard Gregory (1966) and Marr (1982). Gibson\nthinks that this is not a problem the visual system faces because\nvision does not begin with a static retinal array but with an organism\nactively moving through a visually rich environment. Gibson's\npositive approach to vision was to attempt to specify this richness,\nthe information in what he called the ambient optic array,\nespecially invariants in that array, which can be used to distinguish\nagent-dependent and objective features of one's environment. By\nboth emphasizing the role of the movement of a perceiver and the\nintegration of that perceiver in a larger, visually rich environment,\nGibson has been championed as at least a nascent proponent of embodied\nvision (see also Wilson 2004: ch.7; Shapiro 2011: ch.2). \n Esther Thelen and\nLinda Smith (1994) offered a radical challenge to traditional nativist\nviews of cognitive development by applying dynamical systems theory to\ndevelopmental psychology. One important implication of dynamical\nsystems theory is that systems can generate novel behaviors (e.g.,\ndifferent solutions for reaching objects) through bodily activity,\nquestioning the need to posit preprogrammed patterns that unfold over\ntime. Raising fundamental questions about shared assumptions in the\nfield, they argued that the stepping behavior in infants is not driven\nby maturational processes somehow determined by a hard-wired genetic\ncode, but results instead from the interaction between the\ninfant's initial spontaneous limb movements and changing\ncontexts. Thus, they viewed this particular aspect of development as an\nemergent and self organizing product of many decentralized and local\ninteractions taking place in real time, with the promise of\ngeneralizing this approach to cognitive development more generally.  Finally by way of recent historical\nanchoring, the idea that an understanding of the body underpins the\nvery possibility of experience has roots in the\nphenomenological works of Edmund Husserl (1913, 1931), Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty (1945), and Jean-Paul Sartre (1943), roots we saw\nacknowledged by Varela, Thompson, and Rosch in The Embodied\nMind. This earlier continental tradition was explored\nconstructively early on within artificial intelligence, with special\nreference to Heidegger, by Winograd and Flores (1986) and also formed\nthe backdrop to Dreyfus's (1972) classic critique of traditional\ncomputationalism. \n\nEmbodied cognitive science pushes phenomenological accounts in new\ndirections. It seeks not so much to understand how physicality opens up\nthe experience of the self, the world and the others, but rather aims\nto specify the mechanisms that explain just how cognition is\ngrounded in, and deeply constrained by, the bodily nature of cognitive\nagency. We shall not explore the convergence between the early\nphenomenological tradition and embodied cognitive science, although we\nrecognize that phenomenological insights can be an indispensable\nresource for the ongoing investigation of consciousness,\nself-consciousness, action and intersubjectivity (see Gallagher 2009;\nGallagher and Zahavi 2008; Thompson 2007; Gallagher 2005; Wheeler\n2005). \n\nThe general characterization of embodied cognition with which we\nbegan provides the basis for what we will call the Embodiment\nThesis: \n\nAll five of the early examples of work in embodied cognition that we\nbriefly summarized in Section 2 accept the Embodiment Thesis. The\nworking hypothesis of embodied cognitive science is that this thesis is\ntrue either because of the significant causal or the significant\nphysically constitutive role of the body in cognitive processing.\nProponents of embodied cognitive science have advocated both the causal\nand the constitutive claim about the role of the body in cognition.\nWhile the ascription of a physically constitutive role to the body in\ncognition has been taken to challenge traditional cognitive science in\na more radical way than does that of a merely significant causal role\nto it, both versions of the Embodiment Thesis mark a departure from\nviews of the mind dominant in traditional cognitive science. \nRather than following those who attempt to explain embodied cognition\nby appeal to the metaphor of grounding (e.g., Anderson 2003;\nBarsalou 1999, 2008; Glenberg and Robertson 2000; Glenberg et al.\n2005), we think that the best way to articulate the Embodiment Thesis\nfurther is to specify the nature of the dependence of cognition on the\nbody: what particular significant causal or physically constitutive\nroles does the body play in cognition? (cf. Shapiro 2010, 2011; A.\nClark 2008; Thompson 2007; Wheeler 2005; Anderson 2003; M. Wilson\n2002). \nAt the most general level, there are three such distinct functions or\nroles, each with its own implications for embodied cognitive science.\nThe body can function as a constraint on cognition, as a\ndistributor for cognitive processing, or as a\nregulator of cognitive activity. \n\nWe can specify each of these functions or roles more precisely, and\ndraw attention to the distinctive implications that each has, and the\nwork already described that appeals to each of these conceptions of the\nEmbodiment Thesis. \n\nAmongst the alleged implications of the Body as Constraint thesis\nare two we would like to draw attention to: \n\nThe work of Lakoff and Johnson on the permeation of cognition by\nmetaphor, and that of Varela, Thompson, and Rosch on enactive cognition\n(especially in the domain of color perception and categorization), both\nexemplify the Body as Constraint thesis. \nUnlike the role of the body in the Body as Constraint thesis, here\nthe body is taken as sharing in cognitive processing itself, serving to\ndistribute cognitive tasks between brain and body. The Body as\nDistributor thesis has three putative implications worth making\nexplicit: \n\nAs these implications should suggest, it is Body as Distributor that\nis in play for those who take embodied cognition to challenge\ntraditional views of mental representation (Gibson 1979 and Thelen and\nSmith 1994; see also Glenberg 1997 on memory; Shapiro 1997 and Wilson\n2004: ch.7–8 on exploitative representation). The appeal to\nmorphological computation (MacIver 2009), whereby properties\nof anatomical structures (such as the shape of bats ears) play a\ncomputational role in a cognitive process (such as echolocation), also\nrelies on the Body as Distributor thesis. And in subsuming both an\nagent's bodily structures as well as aspects of its environment\nas forms of non-neural structures, the Body as Distributor thesis draws\na connection between embodied cognition and versions of the extended\nmind thesis that appeal to concepts such as realization and scaffolding\n(Wilson and Clark 2009; R. Wilson 2004: ch.5–6; A. Clark 2003). \nClosely related to the Body as Distributor thesis is: \nWe distinguish this version of the Embodiment Thesis from the Body\nas Distributor thesis because of distinctive supposed implications that\nascribing a regulative role to the body in cognition has. These\ninclude: \n\nHere the body has a feedback-driven role in cognitive processing,\nand the Body as Regulator thesis has been especially prominent in\ndynamic approaches to cognition (e.g., Port and van Gelder 1995; Beer\n2000; Thelen and Smith 1994; cf. also Chemero 2009). \nTo summarize this section: we have distinguished three ways to\narticulate the Embodied Cognition Thesis, each specifying a particular\nway in which cognition depends on the body. Put more positively (and we\nthink informatively), there are three distinctive functions or roles\nfor the body that embodied cognitive science might ascribe: as a\nconstraint on cognition, as a distributor for cognitive processing, and\nas a real-time regulator of cognitive activity. Such determinate forms\nof the Embodiment Thesis can ascribe the body either a significant\ncausal role, or a physically constitutive role, in cognition. \n\nIn this section, we explore the revolutionary promise of embodied\ncognitive science with respect to three standard topics in the\nphilosophy of mind and cognitive science: the modularity of mind, the\nnature of mental representation, and nativism. (For alternative views\nof situated cognition and modularity, representation, and nativism, see\nBechtel 2009; Rowlands 2009; and Rupert 2009a). We begin with some\ngeneral, putative contrasts between traditional and embodied cognitive\nscience. \nTraditional views have tended to assume the existence of discrete,\ninternal representations realized by underlying, sharply distinct and\nhighly specified mechanisms in the brain. These mechanisms, in turn,\nhave been shaped by natural selection and encoded in genetic\nstructures. Thus, traditional views have been influential in\nneuroscience and have been committed to individualism or internalism,\nthe claim that cognition supervenes on the intrinsic, physical\nproperties of the cognizer. The research strategy of\n“methodological solipsism” (Fodor 1980, 1981) is one\nclassic version of this individualistic conception of cognition. The\nway in which central topics have been addressed deeply reflects the\nidea that cognitive phenomena can be accounted for locally, and that\nelements beyond the boundaries of the skull are of interest only\ninsofar as they provide sensory input and allow behavioral output.\nBorrowing from Susan Hurley (1998), mainstream views of the mind have\nbeen committed to the “classical sandwich model”, the claim\nthat cognition (in the narrow sense) is segregated from processing in\nlow-level systems, therefore acting like meat in a sandwich em-breaded\nby perception and\naction. \nEmbodied cognitive science, by contrast, has modeled cognition as the\nproduct of dynamic interplay between neural and non-neural processes,\nwith no general fracture between cognition, the agent's bodily\nexperience, and real-life contexts. Here the body is viewed as\nconstraining, distributing, or regulating cognitive processing.\nSpecifying how the body performs these functions in particular\nenvironments raises the prospect that cognition itself is neither\nbounded by the brain, nor perhaps even by the body itself. \nWe can express the prima facie contrast between traditional and\nembodied cognitive science in terms of opposed views of mental\nrepresentation, computation, and realization. Whereas many traditional\naccounts tend to see cognition as representationally localistic,\ncomputationally fixed, and as properly characterized independently of\nthe realizing neuronal system, the features of the physical body and\nthe surrounding environment., embodied cognitive science tends to view\ncognition as, representationally distributed, computationally dynamic,\nand as properly characterized only by reference to details of bodily\nrealization. Embodied cognitive science thus motivates an interrogation\nof some of the fundamental assumptions made in cognitive science. (Such\nprobing is also manifest in views of cognitive modeling that themselves\nare not especially embodied, such as connectionism, which we leave\naside here.)\n \n Modular systems are independent, domain\nspecific, encapsulated and hardwired, and function in a low-to-high\nprocessing hierarchy. When modularity theory was introduced in\ncognitive science (Fodor 1983), central cognition—cognition in\nthe narrow sense—was characterized as non-modular, and as sharply\ndistinct from modular peripheral systems, such as those governing\nperception and motor control (plus, as Fodor says, language).\nFodor's claims about central cognition have been challenged by a\nwide variety of researchers (e.g., Carruthers 2006; Sperber 2001;\nCosmides and Tooby 1997; Hirshfeld and Gelman 1994; see also R. Wilson\n2005, 2008). These critics have argued that higher-cognitive processes\nalso meet modularity criteria. In fact, the view that cognition in the\nnarrow sense is also modular is sufficiently widespread across\ndevelopmental, evolutionary, and cognitive psychology perhaps to count\nas the dominant form of modularity theory in contemporary cognitive\nscience, despite Fodor's contrary view (Fodor 2000). \n\nBoth the traditional, Fodorian account of modularity and its\nrebellious, dominant offspring make reference to the body and the\nenvironment only indirectly. Modularity theory in either guise has\nlittle positive to say about the actual bearing of the beyond-the\nskull-entities on cognitive performance, other than viewing them as a\nsource of input and repository of behavioral output. This view implies\nthat all the tough work, cognitively speaking, is performed by\ncognition central alone, with peripheral processes simply providing\ninputs and executing instructions. The claims that cognitive processing\noccurs purely in the brain in a modular fashion, and accomplishes its\nbusiness by operating essentially independently from motor planning and\nmotor execution, however, are called into question by empirical studies\nof embodied experience. \nOne example of embodied experience in relation to language, one that\nexemplifies the Body as Constraint thesis is Glenberg's Indexical\nHypothesis (Glenberg et alia 2009; Glenberg and Kaschak 2002; Glenberg\nand Robertson 1999, 2000). This view assumes that the understanding of\na sentence is achieved through the activation of relevant action\nschemas, recruiting the same neural mechanisms active in overt\nbehavior, and by affordance combination. Consider the sentences: \n\nAlthough both (1a) and (1b) are grammatical, the reason why (1b)\ndoes not make the same kind of sense as (1a) does is because the\naffordances of glasses do not mesh with the action of drying.\nUnderstanding the meaning of such sentences requires knowing the\npossibilities offered by objects referred to in them. These\npossibilities are constrained by the interaction between bodily\ncapabilities and the referents. Another study showed that people are\nfaster to comprehend sentences where objects provide the affordances\nneeded to accomplish an action (e.g., chair with four wheels to move\nlarge boxes) than sentences in which objects do not (e.g., a chair with\nfour missing wheels (Kaschak and Glenberg 2000). \nSuch findings indicate that the construal of meaning is constrained by\nthe embodied possibilities a scenario offers, and suggest that\nsensorimotor processes contribute to language comprehension. This\nconclusion would likely be rejected by modularists because their\ncommitment to encapsulation and domain specificity implies that\nlanguage processing cannot be modulated by motor information and\nbackground knowledge. Borghi, Glenberg and Kaschak (2004) have also\nreported that in language comprehension the perspective implied by the\nsentence guides the retrieval of information about objects, making\nconceptual knowledge available. Responses to questions over whether an\nobject (e.g., a table) is part of the location described in the\nsentence are faster if there is compatibility between the object-noun\nand the perspective implied by the sentence (e.g., eating in a\nrestaurant). Embodied responses are activated also in judging specific\nobjects' properties, suggesting that vision and action are\ntightly integrated in the biological organism, and that they jointly\nconstrain cognitive processing. \nThe sharp distinction between vision and action that is part of the\ntraditional modular account of cognition has also been challenged by\nstudies of embodied experience. For example, when people are asked to\nchoose among stairs of different heights the one they can ascend most\neasily their responses are consistent with respect to their\nstair-climbing abilities (Warren 1984). Similar results have been\nreported for judgments of grasping objects (van Leeuwen et alia 1994)\ncatching balls (Oudejams et alia 1996) and climbing walls (Wagman and\nCarello 2001). Studies such as these support the general claim that\nperceptual experience incorporates anticipated embodied interaction,\nsuggesting either that vision and action are integrated, or at least\nfeedback linked, in ways that are incompatible with the flow-through\nmodel of cognition postulated by modularists (Hurley 1998; R. Wilson\n2010). \nEven ascribing emotions, intentions or beliefs to someone appears to\npresuppose a certain bodily realization. Unlike traditional views,\nwhich posit an innate Theory of Mind module to account for social\ncognition (Leslie, 1987; Baron-Cohen 1995), an increasing number of\nstudies in the field (Rizzolatti and Craighero 2004; Rizzolatti et alia\n1996; Gallese et alia 1996), suggests that the understanding of other\nminds is primarily based on the motor expertise underlying our capacity\nto act. Such embodied understanding is not only different in nature\nfrom the modalities of mindreading as traditionally understood, but\nalso strongly indicates that the meaning of intentional behavior can be\ngrasped only if we know bodily, experientially or both what it is like\nto be in a mental state. \nThe processing that underwrites a variety of mental\nphenomena—discerning meaningful sentences from those that are\nnot, extracting the possibilities afforded by objects, and detecting\nintentional behaviors—thus requires the orchestrated contribution\nof many components, neural and non-neural. If bodily states and\nbrain's modality-specific systems serve as the grounding of\nvarious aspects of our cognitive life, then traditional, amodal\ndomain-specific modules are not the meaningful elements of analysis\nthey have been assumed to be under the Disembodiment Thesis. The claim\nthat cognition heavily relies on the processes evolved to allow\norganisms to interact effectively with the environment suggests that\nthe mind is not decoupled from embodied experience in the way\npresupposed by traditional views in cognitive science. Rather, the body\ncan act as a constraint on cognition, and as a\ndistributor for cognitive processing (see Section 3). \nAt the heart of the\ntraditional scientific understanding of cognition lies a particular\nconception of mental representation (Fodor and Pylyshyn 1988; Newell\nand Simon 1972). This conception claims that representations are\nsymbolic structures with quasi-linguistic and combinatorial properties,\nact as vehicles of contents, and are what are primarily appealed to in\nexplaining intelligent behavior. Mental representations are symbolic\nand abstract in that the same representation, such as\n“table” is used to mean different kinds of table. They are\namodal in that the same representation can be employed when\n“table” is written or spoken about. Such representations\nare arbitrarily related to their referents because the way in which\nthey are formed and deployed, along with their characteristics, bears\nno relationship to the physical and functional features of the\nreferents. Thus, on the traditional view, not only are the internal\nrepresentations employed in language, concept formation, and memory\nessentially distinct from those processed by the sensorimotor system,\nbut their meaning is divorced from bodily experience. Supporters of\nthis view have been committed to at least three fundamental\nprinciples: \nRecently, several alternative explanations for adaptive behavior\nhave gained attention. While diverse, they all call into question the\ncommitment to these principles. By advancing the idea that cognitive\nactivity re-uses the processes and the representations deployed in\nperception and action, these explanations pose a serious challenge to\nthe notion that conceptual and semantic representations are (or must\nbe) amodal. There remain significant differences between these views\nwith respect to the radicalness of their anti-representationalist\nleanings (see Chemero 2009; Hutto and Myin 2013; Myin and Degenaar 2014). \nAmongst the most influential anti-representationalist views is\ndynamical systems theory (Beer 1990, 2002, 2003; Brooks 1991a, 1991b,\n2002; Thelen and Smith 1994; Van Gelder 1992). Dynamicists tend to\nminimize and sometimes even deny the need for a centralized\nrepresentational processor. The notion of representation that these\nauthors challenge is relatively specific: an internal model capable of\nreproducing the external environmental structure that is used by the\ncognitive agent to guide its behavior in relative independence from the\nworld. Dynamical systems theory has proven to be popular in robotics\nand in work on artificial life, which has tried to explain adaptive\nbehavior in terms of embodiment and embeddedness. As long as a situated\ncreature can sense its world so as to allow its body to be directly\ninfluenced, abstract symbolic descriptions can be dispensed with. \nFormulating an empirically adequate theory of intelligent behavior\nwithout appealing to representations at all, however, faces insuperable\ndifficulties, and the idea that it is a relatively trivial matter to\nscale up from existing dynamic models to explain all of cognition\nremains wishful thinking and subject to just the problems that\nmotivated the shift from behaviorism to cognitive science in the first\nplace. For example, organism-environment interaction alone cannot\naccount for anticipatory behavior, which involves internal factors\nbeyond the immediate constraints of the environment to achieve or\nfulfill future needs, goals or conditions. Domains raising a\nrepresentation-hungry problem (A. Clark 1997) are those involving\nreasoning about absent, non-existent or counterfactual states of\naffairs, planning, imaging and interacting (for a recent, contrasting\nview, see Chemero 2009). \nMoreover, it is unclear why embodied cognitive science could not also\nbe symbolic, representational, abstract, etc.. Puzzlement here is\nmagnified by the fact that many self-styled embodied approaches to\ncognition are symbolic, representational, abstract, etc.. What\nthey offer are specific views of what mental symbols and\nrepresentations are, and how they function in our cognitive economy.\nTypically, they replace the conception of propositional encoding with\none according to which symbols convey a modality-specific feature. \nOne view that adapts, rather than dispenses with, the notion of mental\nrepresentation is Lawrence Barsalou's perceptual symbols theory\n(1999, 2003, 2008, 2009). This theory rests on the assumption that\nhuman cognition does not consist of amodal representations that bear\narbitrary relations to their referents in the world, but rather\nrepresentations whose activation patterns include information from\nvarious sensory modalities. For example, the symbolic structure that\nrepresents the color of an object in its absence, say, during imagery\nor problem solving tasks, depends upon the same neural system that is\nrecruited when the color is actually perceived. Thus, not only do\ncognitive and perceptual mechanisms share representational states, but\ncognitive processing essentially re-activates sensorimotor areas to run\nperceptual simulations. A further implication is that perceptual\nsymbols are not independent of the biological system that embodies them\nand the content conveyed would be likely to vary if intelligent systems\nvaried physically. Since appeal to the body and sensorimotor processes\nconstrains the nature of symbols available to cognition,\nBarsalou's theory exemplifies the Body as Constraint\nthesis. \nWhile defenders of modal representations argue that there is little\ndirect empirical evidence for amodal representations, with the adoption\nof the traditional model of representation largely motivated by\ntheoretical reasons (Barsalou et alia 2003, 85), and that their own\nviews are empirically plausible (see Pecher et alia 2003; Zwaan and\nYaxley 2003; Glenberg and Kaschak 2002; Martin and Chao 2001; Solomon\nand Barsalou 2001; Martin et alia 2000; Spivey et alia 2000), they also\nunderestimate the difficulty of providing definitive evidence against\namodal accounts. As Machery (2007) points out, subjects'\nperformance can be accommodated by both modal and amodal explanations\n(see also Rupert 2006). Since most amodal advocates (e.g., Simon 1995;\nFodor 1975) do not deny the involvement of perceptual areas during\ncognitive tasks, such as visual imagery, showing that visual cortex is\nactivated when, say, imaging the green of an apple does not provide\nevidence for Barsalou's theory over the amodal account. Moreover,\nas traditionalists point out, some mental problems are solved without\n(reportable) imagery, and subjects sometimes draw upon knowledge stored\nin modality-free representational systems. Hence, generalizing results\nconcerning the use of perceptual simulations in some tasks to all\ntasks, which is required for a general modal theory of representation,\nis problematic. \n Most researchers today recognize that cognition\ndevelops as a result of the dynamic interplay of innateness and\nlearning, even if it is not always clear how this interplay proceeds.\nOn the two-dimensional view of nativism defended by one of us elsewhere\nthat distinguishes between strong and weak forms of nativism, (R.\nWilson 2004: ch.3), strong nativists are committed to the following two\ntheses: \n\nStrong anti-nativists (such as classic empiricists), by contrast,\ndeny both of these general views. \n\nParadigms committed to strong nativism has produced remarkable\nresults in the field of cognitive development of infants, in domains\nincluding arithmetic and physics (Baillargeon 2002, Baillargeon et alia\n1985; Spelke et alia 1992, 1995). Those critical of nativism have\nlabeled nativism as antidevelopmental in nature (Haith 1998), and\nclaimed that conclusions that the mind consists of hard-wired traits\nthat unfold through maturation on a fixed pattern conflict with the\nvery idea of learning and flexibility (Quartz and Sejnowski 1997;\nThelen and Smith 1994; Bates et alia 1995; Karmiloff-Smith 1994). If\nnativism were true, then the body and environment (including culture),\nwhile relevant, should be regarded as no more than\n“triggers” of ontogenetically determined features that\ndevelop in predictable ways. \nAlthough prima facie it might be thought that embodied cognition has no\ndistinctive implications for the ongoing debate between\n“nativism” and “empiricism”, one contribution\nof embodied cognitive science here lies in its specific exploration of\nthe roles that the body plays in cognitive processing. These roles\noften pose challenges to strong nativist and strong empiricist views\nalike. As such, embodied cognitive science does not simply assume, with\nempiricists, that cognitive processing depends to a great extent on\nenvironmental exposure, and that cognition is a causal reflection of\nit. Further, while empiricists typically conceive of the world as\nsomething objectively given to a subject, who thus forms a static\nrepresentation of it that then guides action, embodied cognitive\nscience addresses how the dynamic interplay between embodied agent and\nthe world generates cognition. It is this focus on dynamic, worldly\ninterplay that provides one link from embodied to embedded cognition\nwithin situated cognitive science. Here we will explore whether, and in\nwhat ways, embodied cognitive science has been thought to undermine\nstrong nativist claims. \nBy and large, embodied cognitive science generally downplays the\ninternal richness needed to perform complex behavior (Rupert 2009a),\nhighlighting the fact that cognitive processing and development are\ndeeply affected by perturbation across changes in the environment and\nthe body in action (Griffiths and Stotz 2000; Clark and Toribio 1994;\nThelen and Smith 1994; Varela, Thompson and Rosch 1991; Ballard 1991).\nThe body in action is a powerful constraint on how organisms conceive\ntheir niche, as this constraint allows certain interactions and\nexperiences to have an effect on concept formation and understanding of\nlinguistic meaning. For example, by having fingers capable of grasping\nobjects and legs capable of walking and climbing walls, we sort and\ncategorize stimuli in ways that are radically different from, say, the\nways in which they are sorted by butterflies. One's own\nordinarily kinesthetic experiences essentially frame the acquisition\nand development of cognitive structures. That appears to support the\nsignificant contribution of the beyond-the-skull components in\nrealizing cognitive phenomena, and in terms of the framework we have\nintroduced (see section 3) it exemplifies both the Body as Constraint\nand Body as Distributor theses. \n\nExamples supporting the Body as Distributor thesis come\nfrom non-nativist research on perception. Many putative modules, such\nas those for sensory processing, develop partly via learning. In the\nnewborn, sensory modalities and cortical pathways are not as\ndifferentiated as are those of mature brains but appear to emerge\nthrough a series of strengthening interactions between the active body\nand the environment (Quartz and Sejnowski 1997). This implies that in\ninfants few, if any, cortical pathways are domain specific and highly\nspecialized for most tasks, but during development by virtue of active\ninteractions with the environment get recruited and tuned up for\nprocessing particular stimuli (Elman et alia 1996). Other empirical\nresults in the study of sensory modalities point in the same direction,\nrejecting the idea that the senses are dedicated modules wired up for\nperception at birth, with the body's interactions with the\nenvironment playing only a secondary role in constraining or even\ndetermining the nature of perceptual processing. \n\nConversely, it seems that many relevant capacities are not as\ndomain-specific as they may initially appear. For example, even though\nthe visual cortex appears dedicated to process a particular class of\ninformation, it can be recruited by a different sense modality during\nthe reading of Braille—whether the subject has congenital,\nacquired or induced (blindfold) blindness (Sadato et alia 1996, 1998;\nsee also Pascual-Leone and Hamilton 2001; Pascual-Leone et alia 1998).\nIf we extend these observations to face recognition, further support\nfor the hypothesis that specialization begins at later stage of\ndevelopment, by virtue of experience, arises. Despite the fact that the\nfusiform face area (FFA) is highly selective to faces (Kanwisher 2000;\nKanwisher et alia 1997), data suggest that it can also be activated in\nresponse to non-face features, such as birds and cars, provided that\nsubjects have a substantial expertise in those categories (Gauthier et\nalia 2000). While this evidence does not call into question the idea of brain\nspecialization, it does indicate the role of bodily activity in\ngenerating the differentiation of cortical pathways and the emergence\nof specific functions, such as direction-selective responses in the\nvisual cortex. Embodied interactions with the world shape and control\nthe mechanisms responsible for this information processing, offering\nsupport for the Body as Distributor and Body as Regulator\ntheses. Additionally, consider studies investigating how switching\nhandedness shapes cortical sensorimotor representations of finger\nmovements. A left to right switch of handwriting not only triggers a\ngeneral re-organization of motor dominance but also has a wider impact\non the functional neuroanatomy of the motor system that controls the\nhands, influencing even motor tasks that require little skill\n(Kloeppel et al 2007). The re-organization patterns found in converted\nleft-handers show how flexible the brain is in terms of which regions\ncan do what in response to educational training and hand use\nthroughout life, and how bodily features and interaction schemas are\nconditions to which the brain is attuned to.  These studies can be\ninterpreted as suggesting that embodied interactions and the\nbeyond-the-body environment may themselves be partial realizers of the\ncorresponding cognitive activity. Including non-neural parts of the\nbody amongst the physically constitutive building blocks of cognition\nsuggests a more radical reading of embodied cognition. \n\nStrong nativist claims may also be challenged when considering\ncognition beyond the sense modalities. The issue concerning how much\nlanguage-specific information, if any, is innate has been one of the\ndominant topic in cognitive science and the literature relevant to the\nmatter provides us with a wide range of possibilities. Some (Pinker\n1994; Chomsky 1975, 1980), for instance, conclude that a specific\ninnate endowment help explain several aspects of children's\nlinguistic performance. Others (Cowie 1999; Bates 1998; Bates et alia\n1995), instead, find this conception unparsimonious and puzzling from\nan evolutionary standpoint, and claim that nonlinguistic learning\nfactors significantly constrain and control the range of possibilities\nthat characterize spoken language. \n\nEncouragement for this latter view comes from evidence that shows\nhow language acquisition heavily depends, beyond environmental\nexposure, on a number of different factors, including working memory\nand general cognitive development (Seung and Chapman, 2000). First\nlanguage learning, for instance, builds on what children already know\nabout objects and events they experienced and this knowledge background\nprovides them with the basis onto which they can map words (see E.\nClark 2004 for reviews). Their ability to develop a language is also\naffected by information they receive from adults and caregivers.\nAccordingly, they will be sensitive and prone to pick up the\nregularities they hear more often, such as frequent words, sounds,\ninflections and grammar constructions (Saffran et alia 1996; De\nVilliers 1985). Also social interactions appear to be crucial to the\nprocess of language acquisition. Children more quickly learn to name\nthings that are physically present during a conversation and to which\nthe joint focus of attention is directed (E . Clark 2003; Tomasello\n2003). Even language development in children affected by Autistic\nSpectrum Disorder (ASD), commonly held to have a genetic origin, can be\nmodulated by parental and social factors, such as gender and high level\nof education (Grandgeorge et alia 2009). The same holds for normal\ndevelopment in which the size and production of a child's\nvocabulary appears to be deeply related to parents' lexical\nrichness, monitoring of language interaction and socioeconomic status\n(Hoff 2003; Hoff and Naigles 2002). \n\nImplications of these findings support the Body as Distributor\nthesis and place primary emphasis on the view that properties of\nlanguage-learning process heavily depend on the environmental and\nsocial conditions within which an individual is raised. They also\nindicate that direct engagement with the world and other individuals\nregulate language functioning and that this functioning is inseparably\nlinked to and exploits the affordances of the situation within which\nlanguage processes take place. \n\nFurther support for the Body as Distributor thesis comes from\nevidence that differences in early gesture explain disparities in\nchildren's vocabulary size (Rowe and Goldin-Meadow 2009a).\nParents frequently appealing to gesture to translate their words\nprovide children with an opportunity to learn particular meanings by\nhands and this parent-child gesture use accounts for the correlation\nbetween early gesture of children at 14 months and later vocabulary\nskills and size at 54 months. Although gesture is not the only factor\nmediating language development, evidence strongly suggests that\nexposure to a broader range of embodied interactions determines lexical\nrichness and vocabulary growth. Other findings (Rowe and Goldin-Meadow\n2009b; Rowe et alia 2008;\n Ozçalişkan and\nGoldin-Meadow 2005; Iverson and\nGoldin-Meadow 2005; Acredolo and Goodwyn 1988) point in the same\ndirection: parents who gesture very frequently encourage the child to\ngesture and gesturing may then influence language development. These\nfindings collectively suggest that if learning is body-based and\ncorrelated with nonlinguistic aspects of behavior, then appeals to some\nforms of innateness seem unlikely to account for such features of\nlanguage development. Additional support for the Body as Distributor thesis comes from\ndata showing the role of gestures in reasoning. According to the\nGesture as Simulated Action (GSA) Framework (Hostetter and Alibabi\n2008), gestures derive from mental simulations of actions and\nperceptual states that people utilize when thinking, and they affect\nthe cognitive mechanisms in service of mental imagery, judgment and\nproblem solving by raising activation of sensorimotor areas (see\nAlibabi et alia 2014 for a recent discussion). \n\nIt should be clear that no form of the Embodiment Thesis denies the\nbiological grounds of language processes and cognitive activity. What\nit challenges is the adequacy of current research programs that\ncontinue to build heavily on the idea that language and cognitive\ndevelopment rely on processes and mechanisms that are domain-specific\nand causally powerful. Embodied cognitive science has generated\nevidence that suggests that non-neural structures are not merely\nsecondary resources. Rather, they variously foster, constitute, and\ndetermine the acquisition and development of specific psychological\ncapacities, including those operant in language and perceptual\nprocessing. \n\nIn this section, we focus on five empirical domains in which an\nembodied perspective has motivated novel insights about cognition and\nthe mind: visual consciousness, concepts, memory, the understanding of\nother minds, and moral cognition. We limit discussion to these five\ntopics for reasons of space and clarity, not because these are the only\nfive to which these theoretical tools can be fruitfully applied (see\nGibbs 2006 for an extensive presentation and discussion of a wider\nrange of applications).  Visual consciousness is typically\nviewed as a process within the brain. Yet the issues about the\nrelationship between conscious experience and neural structures are\nempirically and philosophically controversial. Brain plasticity, for\nexample, provides some reason to think that there could be different\nneural substrates for a given conscious visual experience, both within\nthe same individual at different times, or different individuals at the\nsame time. And even if one assumes that brain states alone suffice for\nvisual conscious experience (‘the minimal substrate thesis’\nfor short), one might still wonder whether neural correlates of visual\nconsciousness systematically match the content of perceptual\nexperience. While a considerable number of neuroscientists seem to\nshare the commitment to the matching-content doctrine, the literature\non the neural correlates of consciousness, as Noë and Thompson\n(2004) point out, says very little, if anything, to prove that neural\nstates match visual conscious experience in content. \nHence, while seemingly obvious, upon closer examination the\nbrain-centered view (endorsed by prominent scholars, such as Koch\n2004; Chalmers 2000; Metzinger 2000; Crick and Koch 1990, 1998; Crick\n1996) appears problematic. Defenders of embodied cognition (most\nnotably Noë and Thompson 2004; Noë, 2004; O'Regan and\nNoë, 2001; Thompson and Varela, 2001; Hurley, 1998;) advance\nseveral arguments to cast doubt on the matching-content doctrine and\nthe minimal substrate thesis. One argument concerns the\nincommensurability of the features of the content of visual\nexperience. Whereas the content of a visual experience is\nexperiential—that is, represented from a point of view, active\nand attentional—none of these properties seem to be ascribable\nto the content of a neural representational system (Noë and\nThompson 2004). Roughly put, while animals and people experience the\nworld relative to an egocentric standpoint and, phenomenologically\nspeaking, attend to portions of it that can be revealed and explored\nthrough appropriate movements of the head and body, neurons do not\n(Noë 2004; O'Regan and Noë 2001). Just as the sense of our\nvisual conscious experience depends on our implicit mastery of\nsensorimotor contingencies—a set of rules concerning how sensory\nstimulation varies as a function of movement—conscious visual\nexperience is a temporary pattern of skillful activity. It is\nsomething we do (Noë and O'Regan 2002). (A thorough analysis of\nthe meaning of this claim, which affords at least two main\ninterpretations, one radical and one moderate, along with a review of\nthe debate it generated, can be found in Loughlin 2014, O’Regan\n2011, Noe 2010, Shapiro 2010, Hickerson 2007). Whether or not these\nauthors are right, their claim is significant, as it urges\nneuroscientists and philosophers to pursue a rather different approach\nto understanding the basis of visual consciousness (Gangopadhyay,\nMadary, and Spicer, 2010). \nTwo striking, experimentally-generated phenomena that indicate\nsurprising dimensions to the limitations of our explicit visual\nknowledge have been invoked in support of embodied views of visual\nconsciousness. The first of these, change-blindness (Levins and Simons\n1997), occurs when changes to a visual scene are coordinated with the\nshort periods during which a subject is saccading; the second,\ninattentional blindness (Mack and Rock 1998; Simons and Chambris 1999),\nwhen such changes occur while subjects are engaged in an\nattention-intensive task. Under such conditions, subjects can fail to\nreport noticing even massive and (to other observers) striking changes\nto a visual scene, such as the appearance of a dancing gorilla walking\nthrough the middle of the scene. \nThese phenomena call into question the traditional assumption that the\nbrain reconstructs detailed and accurate internal models of the visual\nfield. This assumption, while widespread, has obscured two important\npoints, each motivating a shift to an embodied perspective on vision:\n \nThat subjects are usually capable of noticing large changes to, and\nunexpected elements in, the visual field, show several things. Most\nimportantly for present purposes, visual conscious experience is a\nskillful engagement with the world and heavily depends on what we\ndo with our eyes, head and body to bring something into visual\nconsciousness. This implies that we must ‘do’ something in\norder to engage in a conscious experience, and only by way of our\nbodily movements can attentional processes be directed to the\nenvironment. Thus, body and world not only matter as sources of causal\ninfluence, but act as non-neural substrates of the machinery realizing\nthe enactment of visual consciousness. \nGiven the current state of neuroscience, the conclusion that phenomenal\nexperience cannot be explained by processes in the head seems hard to\naccept (Block 2005). Distributed consciousness has inescapable\nconsequences. One might assume, for example, that if two people with\nthe same internal states were in different environments, their\nconscious experience would be different and that a brain in a vat would\nnot have any visual conscious experience, because a brain in a vat has\nno body and accordingly cannot interact with the environment as we\nnormally do. \nRegardless of how convincing these arguments are, the genuine insight\nabout the nature of consciousness that embodied cognitive science has\ngenerated is that the character of visual experience results from the\nway we are dynamically hooked up to the world. Sensorimotor coupling\nwith the environment is crucial in providing the organism with the\nproprioceptive/kinesthetic feedback necessary for the sense of\nownership of movement. When we touch an object, for example, we do not\nexclusively have experience of it, but while touching and being\ntouched we experience ourselves moving, including the feeling of\ncontrolling our own body in action. The account that agency (the sense\nof controlling one's own body) originates in processes that evolved\nfor interaction with the environment—that is, mechanisms for\nsensory processing and motor control (Tsakiris et alia 2007; Berti et\nalia 2005; Haggard 2005; Farrer et alia 2003; Leube et alia 2003;\nFarrer and Frith 2002; Chaminade and Decety, 2002)—suggests that\nembodied experience underpins self awareness. For a recent contrasting, yet embodied, account of agency and its\nrelated disorders refer to work in phenomenological psychiatry (Fuchs\n2011, 2010, 2009, 2005; Sass and Parnas 2001; Stanghellini\n2004). Here, Frith’s (1992) attempt to ‘neuralizing’\nconsciousness, subjectivity and agency by causally tracing them back\nto neurophysiological correlates is challenged by a view that places\nstrong emphasis on the notion of “lived corporality”. \nConsistent with the view that consciousness and action may be closely\nrelated, brain imaging studies have shown that delusions of control,\noften seen in schizophrenic patients, are associated with a failure in\nthe mechanism by which the predicted consequences of an action are\nlinked to the intended sequence of motor commands (Frith et alia 2000).\nDeficits of this kind suggest that the ability to control and hold\nconscious thoughts may recruit the same mechanisms employed in\ninteractions with the\nenvironment.  A common assumption in traditional\naccounts is that concepts are context-independent amodal symbols. There\nare several problems with this view and research is strong in\nsuggesting that conceptual capacities incorporate and are structured in\nterms of patterns of bodily activity. Talking or thinking about objects\nhave been suggested to imply the reactivation of previous experiences,\nand the recruitment of the same neural circuits involved during\nperception and action towards those objects would allow the\nre-enactment of multimodal information (color, size, width, etc). In\nprinciple, the view that concepts are represented through abstract\nsymbols, rather than modality specific features, and cognition requires\nstable forms of representation should be either dropped or strongly\nrevisited. \nEvidence reveals that people construct concepts quite differently in\ndistinct contexts (Solomon and Barsalou 2001; Wisniewski 1998; Medin\nand Shoben 1988; Barsalou and Ross 1986), and conceptualization can\nvary across individuals and be different for the same individual in\ndistinct occasions. When subjects are asked to provide definitions for\ncategories, like bird and chair (see Barsalou 1993) only 44% of the\nfeatures in one person's definition exist in another\nperson's definition and a great deal of flexibility exists also\nwithin individuals providing definitions for the same categories two\nweeks later. \n\nAlso the pattern of interaction entertained with an object may\ninfluence the way conceptualization is done. People dealing with\ncertain items and their structural parts more frequently and\nextensively than others will tend to develop representations that\nreflect the nature of their interactions with them. Not surprisingly,\ndistinct tree experts (such as a taxonomist, a landscape worker and a\npark maintenance personnel) will categorize trees in ways that differ\nfrom one other and from non-specialists (Medin et alia 1997). These\nstudies draw upon and reinforce the theory of perceptual symbol\nsystems (Barsalou 1999) and strongly indicate that perceptual and\nmotor mechanisms are engaged when people perform conceptual processing.\nThey also suggest that completely modality-free categories are rare,\nbecause concepts, whether concrete or abstract, are distributed over\nmodality specific domains and involve reactivation of states in\nsensorimotor systems (Boronat et alia 2005; Gallese and Lakoff 2005;\nBarsalou et alia 2003; Tranel et alia 2003; Beauchamp and Martin 2007;\nMartin and Chao 2001; Martin et alia 2000; Pulvermüller 1999;\nMartin et alia 1996). \n\nFurther support for the theory that modalities play a pivotal role in\nconcept representation comes from work on property verification\n(Solomon and Barsalou 2001; Pecher et alia 2003). Property\nverification consists in deciding whether a property in a specific\nmodality fits an object, for example, the auditory\nproperty loud for BLENDER and the visual\nproperty green for APPLE. Findings demonstrated that subjects\nperforming the task responded faster and more accurately when the\nprevious verification was in the same modality (e.g.,\nLEAVES—rustling) rather than in a different modality\n(e.g., CRANBERRIES—tart) (Pecher et alia 2003). The\neffect is explained by assuming that concept representation does not\nactivate the abstract features of an object but uses the same system\nthat is recruited for perception in different modalities. So, if the\nauditory system is used for hearing the sound of a blender, then to\nrun a simulation (that is, form a concept) of the sound of a\nBLENDER the auditory system will be recruited. Slower responses in\ndifferent modalities are associated with cost in switching attention,\nand the effort made in switching modalities speaks against the idea\nthat knowledge is represented in a modality-free manner. Conversely,\nthere should not be any differences between same-modality and\ndifferent-modality conditions. \n\nThe fact that sensorimotor circuits get recruited, or rather,\nre-used for purposes, like concept formation or language\nprocessing, other than those they have been established for, such as\nmotor and sensory information processing, strongly favors modal and\nembodied approaches to cognition over amodal and abstract ones. It also\noffers an alternative perspective on several topics in the sciences of\nthe mind, including the degree of modularity in cortical organization,\nthe development of the brain and the localization hypothesis of\ncognitive functions (see Anderson 2010 for a recent theory of neural\nre-use). \n\nWhile these findings have provoked revisions to traditional\naccounts, the specific conclusion that sensorimotor processes are\nphysically constitutive of conceptual processing has not been\nuniversally accepted on the grounds that the data are consistent with\ndifferent theories (see Mahon and Caramazza 2008; Rupert 2009b:\nch.9–10). Consider the case of remembering how tools\nand ingredients are displayed in the kitchen in order to instruct\nsomeone to bake a cake. Traditional accounts would claim that\ninformation storage and retrieval should be featured as essentially\nindependent from sensorimotor mechanisms. However, it does not seem\nfrom empirical evidence that remembering appeals to the semantic\nrelatedness of ingredients and tool but rather consists of forming an\nimage revealing where ingredients and tools are located as a function\nof our imagined movement throughout the kitchen. The location itself\nserves as external aid to memory and imagined embodied actions within\nthe location afford the retrieval of information that help figure out\nwhat is needed to bake a cake (Cole et alia 1997). That the time needed\nto recall and retrieve information is constrained by the imaged spatial\nlayout with reference to the observer's body has been shown by a\ndifferent set of studies (Bryant and Wright 1999; see also Waller et\nalia 2008; Nori et alia 2004; McNamara 2003; Waller et alia 2002). \n\nEmbodiment effects on memory have been also found in accomplishing\nparticular tasks, including reasoning and language understanding, and\nseveral recent works suggest that memory reflects different bodily\ncapacities (M. Wilson 2001; Glenberg 1997; Carlson 1997). For instance,\nhand-arm movements, that often accompany speech, do not play a mere\ncommunicative role but facilitate the maintenance of spatial\nrepresentations in working memory (Wesp et alia 2001) and recalling\nenacted action-phrases is significantly easier with respect to purely\nverbal encoding (see Engelkamp, 1998 for a review). This effect\nsuggests that motor information may have become part of the memory\ntrace, thus indicating that action-phrases merely heard do not produce\nthe same effective encoding of real enacted action-sentences. Empirical\nliterature also supports the hypothesis that the memory trace includes\nthe body posture in which the experience was acquired (Barsalou et alia\n2003). Drawing on congruent-posture and incongruent-posture conditions,\nbehavioral data have shown that the body contains the cue to recall\nautobiographical events and the retrieval of a memory of a past\nexperience gets facilitated if the body posture assumed during that\nexperience is reassumed (Dijkstra et alia 2007). Further evidence of\nthe body's constraining capacities has been provided by Presson\nand Montello (1994). In this experiment subjects were first asked to\nmemorize the location of objects in a room and then, while blindfolded,\nwere asked to point to the objects. Pointing was fast and accurate.\nWhile some subjects were then asked to imagine rotating 90° and to\npoint to the objects again, the others were asked to actually rotate\n90° and to point to the objects. In this second half of the\nexperiment, pointing was slow and inaccurate only for those who\nimagined the rotation. A recent, informative survey of memory-related empirical phenomena,\nwhich also explains in what sense memory can be understood as an\nembodied skill, namely, a process incorporating bodily experience, can\nbe found in Sutton and Williamson (2014). Folk psychology is the commonsense\nunderstanding we have of one another in terms of internal mental\nstates, such as beliefs and desires, that in combination can be used to\npredict and explain human behaviour. The traditional perspective on\nunderstanding folk psychology presupposes that our attributional\ntendencies here are generated by an internal theory (Premack and\nWoodruff 1978), and on some versions of this “theory\ntheory” view of folk psychology, this internal theory is executed\nby a theory of mind module in the brain (Leslie 1987). Opponents of\nthis view, simulation theorists, minimize the role played by the kind\nof abstract theorizing typical of theories, and question whether such a\ntheory of mind module exists. They argue that discoveries and findings\nfrom neuroscience are consistent with the approach that sees social\ncognition as a form of body-based simulation, and conceives of bodily\nstates as the building blocks of intersubjectivity (Oberman and\nRamachandran 2007; Iacoboni and Dapretto 2006; Rizzolatti and Craighero\n2004; Ferrari et alia 2003; Rizzolatti et alia 2001; Umiltà et\nalia 2001; Gallese and Goldman 1998; Rizzolatti and Arbib 1998). \n\nThe discovery of mirror neurons in macaques and humans–cells\nwith sensorimotor properties that fire both when performing an action\nand when observing the very same action executed by other\nindividuals—has been seized on by simulation theorists and other\nopponents of the theory-theory view in support of their preferred\nexplanatory frameworks. (For critical evaluations of fMRI and PET\nstudies aiming to show the presence of a mirror neuron system in humans\nsee Turella et alia 2009; see also Hickok 2008.) \nIndirect evidence in support of a mirror system in humans comes from\nstudies on the reactivity of cerebral rhythm, the posterior alpha\nrhythm and the central mu rhythm, during action observation. While the\nmu rhythm is present during motor rest, it disappears when active\nmovements are performed. Electrophysiological results have shown that\nobserving the action executed by another individual blocks the mu\nrhythm of the observer, thus providing evidence for a resonance\nsystem, which links the observed action to the action of the\nsubject's own motor repertoire (Oberman et alia 2005; Cochin et\nalia 1998; Gastaut and Bert 1954, Cohen-Seat et alia 1954). Another\nbody of evidence in support of the existence of an\nobservation/execution matching system in humans comes from transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation studies (Fadiga et alia 1995). Left motor cortex\nof normal participants was stimulated both during the observation of\nintransitive and goal-directed arm movements. Motor evoked potentials\nwere recorded from various hand muscles. The results showed a selective\nincrease in motor evoked potentials in the regions that participants\nnormally recruit for producing the observed action. That means that\nwhen we observe a person grasping a cup of coffee the very same neural\npopulation that controls the execution of the grasping movement becomes\nactive in the observer's motor areas. \n\nOn this view, it is the embodied imitation of the observed body in\naction that directly enables us to recognize others as persons like\nus, not an abstract, inferential and theory-like process. The\nhypothesis that action understanding is based on a resonance mechanism\ndoes not exclude the possibility that other processes, based on\nmovement descriptions, could influence this function. It simply\nhighlights the primacy of a direct, automatic and prereflexive\nmatching between the observation and the execution of action. By\naccepting this premise the traditional tension between acting and\nthinking considerably shrinks, as the capacity to detect the meaning\nof the behaviors of others consists in employing the same resources\nused to model our motor behavior. A dominant tradition in moral\ntheory for the past several centuries has placed reason at the center\nof moral thought and moral behavior. Kohlberg's cognitive\ndevelopmental work on moral cognition (1969) reflects this spirit.\nKohlberg consistently endorsed, along the lines of classic cognitivism,\na rationalist model in which emotions and body states may be taken into\naccount by reason but it is pure reasoning that ultimately leads to\nmoral decisions. His paradigm inspired most leading studies in the\nfield, all characterized by the common view that cognitive processing\nin the moral domain is disengaged from the economy of emotions and\nbody. \nRecent work in embodied moral cognition challenges this paradigm.\nSocial intuitionist models, for instance, claim that many moral\njudgments appear to be the result of affective components (Greene and\nHaidt 2002; Haidt et alia 1993). Subjects presented with descriptions\nof actions that were harmless but likely to produce a strong affective\nresponse/reaction (e.g., eating one's pet dog after a car killed\nit) often judge the action described by the sentence to be wrong. When\npressed to provide a justification, subjects typically focus on\nnonexistent harms associated with the actions, indicating that\nconscious reasoning is not a good predictor of their judgment of\nwrongness. If affective reactions play a pervasive role in moral\njudgments, a role that escapes (and is in fact masked by) conscious\nreflection, this suggests that moral cognition is shaped and\nconstrained by “gut feelings”, rather than the product of\nabstract reasoning. \nFurther examples supporting the embodied nature of moral cognition come\nfrom the experimental literature that specifically addresses\ndisgust/repugnance (Lerner et alia 2004; Wheatley and Haidt, 2005).\nDisgust involves strong physical components and explicit bodily\nchanges, such as nausea, stomach-turning, throat clenching,\nfood-expulsion, thrusting out of the tongue, and wrinkling of the nose.\nEven if disgust evolved as a food-related reaction indicating that a\nsubstance should be either avoided or expelled, it is also an emotion\nof social rejection, extending its reach and influence into the domain\nof moral cognition (Niedenthal et alia 2005; Prinz 2004). \n\nRecent experiments have shown, for example, that the feeling of\ndisgust induced by the exposure to a bad smell or dirty looking room\nmakes moral judgments more severe (Schnall et alia 2008a), and that\nsubjects who physically cleanse themselves then find certain moral\nactions to be less wrong than do participants not exposed to a\ncleanliness manipulation (Schnall et alia 2008b). These ‘moral\nharshness’ effects may be induced even for moral evaluations of\ncertain issues or groups. In a recent study (Inbar et alia 2009)\nexperimenters found that people reported more negative evaluations\ntowards gays and lesbians when exposed to a noxious odor in the room\nthan when no odor was present. Even anger has been shown to deeply\nshape the representations available to moral judgment. Anger over a\ntraffic incident before going to work may lead to an increased reliance\non prejudice when interviewing a job candidate afterwards (DeSteno et\nalia 2004). Accumulating evidence that perception, emotion and judgment are\ngrounded in sensorimotor mechanisms motivated the body-specificity\nthesis (Casasanto 2011, 2009; de la Vega et alia 2012; Brunyé\net alia 2012), the claim that people with different kinds of bodies\ntend to think differently. Right handers, for example, conceptualize\n“good” and “bad” in terms of motor dominance\nrather than cultural conventions and tend to prefer or make positive\nevaluations of people or objects presented in their right side\n(Casasanto 2014, 2009, Casasanto and Henetz 2012). This space-valence\nimplicit mapping can be manipulated via changes in body- environment\ninteractions. Subjects who lost the use of their dominant hand or wear\na glove that impairs motor fluency show a reversal of their space\n–valence associations (Casasanto and Chrysikou 2011). For a\ndetailed discussion of how affective judgments incorporate patterns of\nbodily interaction with the environment and are constrained by a range\nof embodied capabilities see Casasanto 2014. \nThe empirical literature suggests that the specificity of one's\nown bodily cues and affective reactions (e.g., nausea, arousal) guide\nand constrain cognitive processing in social and moral domains. In\naddition, it suggests that dramatic deficits occur when subjects do not\nexhibit and make use of these cues and reactions. Damasio's\nsomatic marker hypothesis (1994, 1996) claims that bodily states,\nnormally triggered during emotional experiences, are re-enacted\nwhenever certain situations occur or are considered, and such\nre-enaction avoids deleterious consequences of one's course of\naction. When the capacity to integrate these feelings (either positive\nor negative) with one's own knowledge of facts is severely\ncompromised, as is the case in ventro-medial-prefrontal cortex (VMPFC)\npatients, making judgments and decisions is severely impaired. As a\n‘gambling task’ (Bechara et alia 1994) reveals, in the\nabsence of embodied states (e.g., anticipatory skin conductance\nresponse) VMPFC patients miss a fundamental source of information about\nthe possible outcomes associated with different actions (see also\nBechara et alia 2000). If Damasio's hypothesis is correct, then\nthe affective and bodily feedback implicated in various types of moral\njudgment do not simply lead to different understandings and\nconceptualizations of the situation at hand, but are part of the\nphysical machinery realizing cognitive processes. \nWhile we think there is broad empirical support for the idea that\nsensorimotor activity and central cognitive processing are more deeply\ndependent on one another than previously thought, and for the view that\nbodily activity can constrain, distribute, and regulate neural\nactivity, embodied cognitive science has also been invoked in support\nof more radical philosophical ideas about cognition and the mind. For\nexample, as we noted in Section 3, some have argued that embodied\ncognition implies that cognition itself leaks out into the body (and\nultimately the environment (A. Clark 2008). Proponents of the\ntraditional view that cognition is skull-bound have argued, in reply,\nboth that this inference is mistaken and the view it leads to is\nimplausible and metaphysically extravagant (Rupert 2009b; Adams and\nAizawa 2008; Aizawa 2007). We take up such further philosophical issues\nin Section 6 below. \nThe difference that embodied cognition makes to the three issues we\ndiscussed in Section 4—the modularity of mind, the nature of\nmental representation, and nativism about the mind, remains a live\nissue of debate in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science. The\nsame is true of the interpretation of the particular empirical results\ndescribed in Section 5. \n\nWe think that some of these disagreements both reflect and\ncontribute to sharper divides over the significance of embodied\ncognitive science. We discuss four such issues in this concluding\nsection, structuring our discussion around four corresponding\nquestions: \nOur aim here is not to provide extensive answers to these questions,\nbut to indicate briefly what our review of contemporary work on\nembodied cognition indicates about the issues that they raise. We take\neach in turn. Insofar as\nembodied cognitive science has its origins in a variety of\ndissatisfaction with traditional cognitive science, it has explored\nnovel questions about cognition and generated results that have, in\nsome cases, been unexpected. As we have seen in the previous section,\nembodied cognitive science continues to produce empirical research that\nis interesting, novel, and controversial. In this respect, embodied\ncognitive science is not simply (or chiefly) a philosophical mantra\nempty of empirical content, but a cluster of perspectives on cognition\nwhose empirical orientation and rootedness cannot be questioned. \n\nBut there is an alternative position that one might take on this\nquestion that is more circumspect about the empirical payoff of\n“embodied cognition”. While there is no doubt about the\nempirical “oomph” of embodied cognitive science, the extent\nto which this work either challenges traditional views or requires one\nor another of the determinate forms of the Embodiment Thesis that we\narticulated—Body as Constraint, Body as Distributor, and Body as\nRegulator—might be questioned. For example, Lawrence Shapiro\n(2011) has argued that the views of Lakoff and Johnson on metaphor,\nthought, and the body are fully compatible with central tenets of\ntraditional cognitive science, such as the idea that cognition\ncentrally involves computation over internal mental representations\n(see also Shapiro 2010). Robert Rupert (2009b) has argued more\ngenerally for compatibility between the empirical findings of embodied\ncognitive science and the core assumptions of traditional cognitive\nscience. Likewise, Fred Adams (2010) has argued that one should\ndistinguish between the empirical premise in arguments for the\nembodiment of cognition, and a requisite logical-metaphysical premise,\nand that the latter of these is seldom supported. (Adams focuses on\nGlenberg's work on meaning affordances (Glenberg and Kaschak\n2002; see also Glenberg and Robertson 2000, Glenberg et al. 2005), but\nhis claims are quite general). From this perspective, one should sift\nthe empirical wheat of embodied cognitive science from the\nrevolutionary, philosophical chaff that has characterized that movement\nfrom the outset. This issue, in turn, brings us to our next issue. For the most part, questioning whether\nembodied cognitive science delivers on the revolutionary front has\nproceeded not by drawing on general considerations—say, of the\nunderdetermination of theory by data—but by a detailed\nconsideration of particular empirical results (cf. Rupert 2009b: ch.11,\nhowever). By its nature, this kind of argument, which we endorse the\nneed for, is time- and space-consuming, especially given the diversity\nof work that falls under the label “embodied cognition”.\nThis is more so in the evaluation of this type of challenge to\nproponents of embodied cognition. Here we settle for making one general\npoint about the state of the dialectic here, and state where we believe\nthe burden of proof lies. \n\nSuppose that we simply grant the historical claim that the focus and\norientation of traditional cognitive science has not taken cognition to\nbe dependent, in any significant way, on the body. What does this imply\nabout the explanatory power of traditional cognitive science vis-a-vis\nthe Embodiment Thesis? Recall that we have analyzed the Embodiment\nThesis in terms of three determinate theses about the nature of the\ndependence of cognition on the body, each with its own particular\nimplications: \n\nThose seeking to resist the challenge that one or more of these\nviews poses to traditional cognitive science have two primary options:\nto deny the truth of the corresponding thesis, or to reject the\ninference(s) from that thesis to claims about what traditional\ncognitive science can and cannot explain. \n\nDefenders of traditional cognitive science have considerable\ndialectical power available here, and they have made effective use of a\nfamiliar argumentative strategy in resisting the embodied cognition\nchallenge: to grant that there is a weak or limited sense in which one\nor more of these particular embodiment thesis is correct, but argue\nthat the inferential gap between such theses and the rejection of views\nsuch as computationalism and representationalism is not bridgeable\n(Adams 2010, Rupert 2009a, 2009b) a strategy that those critically\nsympathetic to embodied cognitive science have also made effective use\nof (e.g., Shapiro 2010, 2011). To this extent, the burden of proof\ncurrently lies squarely with proponents of embodied cognitive science\nwho hold that the revolutionary promise of embodied cognition is real\nto show how those gaps can be bridged. One such putatively radical implication of embodied\ncognition is the Extended Mind Thesis, which says that an agent's\nmind and associated cognitive processing are neither skull-bound nor\neven body-bound, but extend into the agent's world. Unlike the\nEmbodiment Thesis, this thesis arose via more explicitly\nphilosophically-driven discussions—of functionalism (Harman\n1988), of computationalism and individualism (R. Wilson 1994, 1995:\nch.3–4), and of belief (Clark and Chalmers 1998). It thus bears a\ndifferent kind of relationship to empirical work in cognitive science\nthan does the idea of embodied cognition. Despite the legacies of these\ndifferent histories, as we noted in Section 1, embodied cognition and\nextended cognition have recently come to be viewed as peas in the same\npod, as variants of situated cognitive science. \n\nThe first point to draw attention to is that nothing in any of the\nthree determinate forms of the Embodiment Thesis entails the extended\nmind thesis. Thus, the view that cognition is embodied (in some\nspecific sense: constrained, distributed, or regulated) is compatible\nwith the denial of the view that cognition is extended. Expressed in\nterms of the Body as Distributor thesis, perhaps cognitive processing\nis distributed by the body across neural and non-neural resources, but\nall of the relevant non-neural resources are contained within the\nboundaries of the body. We believe that this is the position\noccupied by the core of the embodied cognitive science community. (For\nexample, Barsalou's recent [2008] review paper on “grounded\ncognition”, which completely omits mention of any the large\nphilosophical literature on extended cognition, is indicative of this\nstate of affairs.) \n\nSecond, many of the most influential defenses of the extended mind\nthesis appeal to considerations only tangentially related to the\nbody—to computationalism and individualism (R. Wilson 1994), to\ndistributed and group-level cognition (Hutchins 1995), to parity\nprinciples (Clark and Chalmers 1998), to realization (R. Wilson 2001,\n2004: ch.5–6). For this reason, debate over those arguments and the\nextended view of the mind they putatively support have only recently\nbecome conjoined by advocates (R. Wilson 2010; A. Clark 2003, 2008) and\ncritics (Adams and Aizawa 2008; Rupert 2009b) alike. This recent, joint\nconsideration is of mutual benefit to discussions of both embodied and\nextended cognition. \n\nThus, and third, despite their independence, some have claimed that\nthe most powerful arguments for one of these views also provide strong\nreasons to accept the other. For example, Andy Clark (2008) argues from\nthe active embodiment of cognition to the extended mind thesis.\nSimilarly, some of the most trenchant objections to one of these views\nwould also appear also to serve as the basis for rejecting the other.\nFor example, critics of the extended mind thesis, such as Adams and\nAizawa (2008) and Rupert (2004, 2009b), have objected that those\narguing for the thesis have confused or elided the distinction between\nexternal causes of cognition and external constituents\nof cognition. This charge of committing a\n“coupling-constitution fallacy” is also readily made\nagainst particular embodied cognition views, such as Alva\nNöe's (2004) view that perceptual experience is constituted\nby sensorimotor abilities (see Prinz 2009; Aizawa 2007; Rupert 2006;\nBlock 2005). While there may be relevant differences between embodied\nand extended cognition that imply that such arguments and objections do\nnot transfer, there are at least default, parity considerations that\nput the burden of proof on those claiming those differences. \n\nFourth, there may be deeper reasons for thinking that embodied and\nextended cognition stand or fall together. Rupert (2009b), for example,\nhas recently argued against both embodied and extended cognition in\npart by making a positive case for what he calls the cognitive\nsystems view of the boundaries of cognition, and that this view\nsuggests, together with our best empirical science, that cognition\nbegins and ends in the brain. If Rupert is correct, then cognition is\nneither embodied nor extended because both views are incompatible with\nan independently-motivated account of the brain-bound nature of\nintegrated cognitive architectures. \n\nConversely, in laying out a general conception of situated cognition\nas cognitive extension, Wilson and Clark (2009) claimed that\n“many forms of embodied cognition, properly understood, will turn\nout to involve just the kinds of cognitive extension that we articulate\nhere” (p.56), a promissory note that one of us (R. Wilson 2010)\nhas attempted to cash in offering the following explicit argument tying\ntogether embodied and extended cognition: \n\nClearly, as the premise that explicitly draws a connection between\nthe Embodiment and Extended Mind theses, (4) is where this argument is\nlikely to be scrutinized by those skeptical of the conclusion to this\nargument. Whether that can be done while accepting (1)–(3),\nhowever, is unclear and the kind of issue that requires further\nattention in this debate. If the mind\nis not skull-bound but at least embodied, and perhaps even extended,\nthen what view should we adopt of the self, subjectivity, and\nconsciousness? The penultimate paragraph to Clark and Chalmers (1998)\nadvocated the view that, to put it colloquially, where mind goes, the\nself follows: if the mind is extended, for example, so too is the self\n(see also A. Clark 2001, 2003). Since much of what matters to the\nidentity of one's self is cognitive in nature, at least on\ntraditional views of the self and personal identity, this\n“self-follows-mind” view seems a natural default. \n\nIf the boundaries of the self shift with those of the mind out from\nskull to body, or even from body to world, as the self-follows-mind\nview implies, then accepting embodied or extended cognition will have\ninteresting implications concerning autonomy, sociality, personal\nidentity, and responsibility. For example, it might be that in some\ncases interfering with someone's peripersonal space, the space\nclose to the body, or even certain of one's belongings, will have\na comparable moral significance as interfering with a person's\nbody. And as Clark and Chalmers (1998) suggested in their final\nparagraph, certain forms of social activity might be reconceived as a\nkind of thought activity. The social distribution of human\ndecision-making would also mitigate individual's responsibility\nfor a transgression, thereby producing dramatic ramifications for our\npractices of attributing legal culpability. In effect, if situational\nforces and environmental contingences played a physically constitutive\nrole in decision-making processes so as to become partial realizers of\none's own behavior, as the so called ‘Frail Control\nHypothesis’ seems to suggest (see Churchland and Suhler 2009 for\ncritics to this view), then human beings would have little if any\ncontrol over their actions and presumably no normative competence. \n\nAgainst the self-follows-mind view, Wilson (2004: 141-143) has\nargued that even if one accepts that the mind is extended, there are\nreasons to resist the idea that the self is likewise extended. This\nresistance turns on precisely the kinds of implications indicated\nabove, and their often radical, deeply counter-intuitive, and puzzling\nconsequences. For example, if subjects of cognition (or agents, or\nindividuals) are themselves distributed across brain, body, and world,\nthen why should we punish just one bit of this individual, the bit\ninside the body, when it commits a crime? (Consider this a truncated\nreductio.) More generally, while agents as the subjects of\ncognition are not just a bundle of neural circuits and bodily\nexperience, re-casting agency and subjectivity within the extended\nframework likely requires a far more comprehensive and somewhat uneasy\nreconceptualization of notions such as normative competence, freedom\nand control, and personal identity. Perhaps this simply tells us that\nmuch further exploration is needed concerning how embodied experiences\nin real-world contexts shape cognitive processing. Or perhaps it\nsuggests that more conservative strategies should be employed to\naccount for what the subjects of cognitive processing really are. \n\nOne such strategy is to appeal to the ready-made distinction between\nthe subject or agent of cognition, which can be readily\nidentified as being where the locus of control for a given cognitive\nsystem is, housed in the agent's body, and the cognitive\nsystems in which cognitive processing is realized, which are often\nextended (R. Wilson 2004, ch.5–6). Such a distinction is put to\nantecedent use in making sense of extended biological systems,\nsuch as spiders and the webs they spin—these organisms are\nbounded, roughly speaking, by their cohesive, organic bodies, but still\nact in the world through the extended biological systems they construct\n(R. Wilson 2005, ch.1–4). Thus, an appeal to this distinction here is\nnot ad hoc, and provides a principled basis for a more conservative,\ntraditional view of agency and the self within an extended cognition\nframework.","contact.mail":"lucia.foglia@mail.mcgill.ca","contact.domain":"mail.mcgill.ca"}]
