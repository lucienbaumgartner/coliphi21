One\npervasive and traditional problem, sometimes called “the Problem\nof Perception”, is created by the phenomena of perceptual\nillusion and hallucination: if these kinds of error are possible, how\ncan perception be what we ordinarily understand it to be, an openness to\nand awareness of the world? The present entry is about how these possibilities of error\nchallenge the intelligibility of the phenomenon of perception, and how\nthe major theories of experience in the last century are best\nunderstood as responses to this challenge.\n\nIn this section we spell out the ordinary conception of perceptual\nexperience. There are two central aspects to this: Openness\n(§1.1) and Awareness\n (§1.2). On our ordinary conception of perceptual experience, perceptual\nexperience is a form of “openness to the world” McDowell\n(1994: 111). We understand this more precisely as follows: \nOpenness: Perceptual experience, in its character,\ninvolves the presentation (as) of ordinary mind-independent objects to a\nsubject, and such objects are experienced as present or\nthere such that the character of experience is immediately\nresponsive to the character of its objects.\n To clarify this, we can break it down into two components:\nMind-Independence (§1.1.1), and\nPresence (§1.1.2). The first component of Openness is, \nMind-Independence: perceptual experience involves the\npresentation (as) of ordinary mind-independent objects.\n On ‘object’: we assume a broad understanding of\n‘object’ to encompass perceptible entities in\nmind-independent reality including material objects, but also features\nand other entities (e.g., events, quantities of\nstuff). Mind-Independence is thus a claim otherwise expressed\nas follows: perceptual experience is a presentation of, or is as of, a\npublic, mind-independent subject-matter. On\n‘ordinary’: Mind-Independence concerns\nfamiliar perceptible things, things that we admit as part of\ncommon sense ontology. As P.F. Strawson argued, reflection on ordinary perceptual\nexperience supports a characterization of it in terms of\nMind-Independence: “mature sensible experience (in\ngeneral) presents itself as, in Kantian phrase, an immediate\nconsciousness of the existence of things outside us” (1979:\n97). Strawson begins his argument by asking how someone would\ntypically respond to a request for a description of their current\nvisual experience. He says that it is natural to give the following\nkind of answer: “I see the red light of the setting sun\nfiltering through the black and thickly clustered branches of the\nelms; I see the dappled deer grazing in groups on the vivid green\ngrass…” (1979: 97). There are two ideas implicit in this\nanswer. One is that the description talks about objects and properties\nwhich are, on the face of it, things distinct from this particular\nexperience. The other is that the description is “rich”,\ndescribing the nature of the experience in terms of concepts like deer\nand elms and the setting sun. The description of the experience is not\nmerely in terms of simple shapes and colours; but in terms of the\nthings we encounter in the “lived world” in all their\ncomplexity. As Heidegger puts it, It may be that descriptions of experience like this involve a\ncommitment to the existence of things outside the experience; but\nsurely it is possible to describe experience without this commitment?\nSo let us suppose that we ask our imagined perceiver to repeat their\ndescription without committing themselves to the existence of things\noutside their experience, but without falsifying how their experience\nseems to them. Strawson claims that the best way for them to respond\nis to say “I had a visual experience such as it would have been\nnatural to describe by saying that I saw…” and then to\nadd the previous description of the trees and the deer etc. We give a\ndescription of our experience in terms of the ordinary objects of our\nworld. And we do this even if we are trying not to commit ourselves to\nthe existence of these objects. Strawson’s claim that perceptual experience strikes us as if\nit satisfies what we’re calling Mind-Independence is\nnot a philosophical theory, one that would (for example) refute\nscepticism, the view that we cannot know anything about the\nmind-independent world (see the entry on\n skepticism). Rather, it should be a starting\npoint for philosophical reflection on experience (1979: 94). This is\nwhy this intuitive datum of consciousness is not supposed to rule out\nidealism, the view that the objects and properties we perceive are in\nfact mind-dependent (see the entry on\n idealism). The idealist need not disagree with\nStrawson that reflection on ordinary experience supports\nMind-Independence. They will just hold that, for\nphilosophical reasons, this is not how experience really\nis. Mind-Independence, they can say, is intuitively appealing\nbut ultimately false as a characterization of experience and its\nobjects. The second component of Openness itself involves two\ncomponents. First, the phenomenal character of an experience has\nsomething to do with its presented objects: experience is, in its\ncharacter, a presentation of, or as of, ordinary objects; and\nsecond the character of perceptual experience involves the\npresentation of ordinary objects as\npresent or there in that it is immediately\nresponsive to the character of its objects. \nPresence: the character of perceptual experience itself\ninvolves the presentation (as) of ordinary objects in such a way that\nit is immediately responsive to the character of its presented\nobjects.\n When we reflect upon how the phenomenal character of experience is,\nand try to “turn inwards” to describe the nature of the\nexperience itself, the best way to do this is to describe the objects\nof experience and how they seem to us. It seems a simple matter to\nmove to the further claim that the way these objects actually are is\npart of what determines the phenomenal character of an experience. But this is to move too fast. For what can be said here about\nexperience can also be said about belief: it is widely accepted that\nif I want to reflect upon the nature of my beliefs, the best way to do\nthis is to describe the object or content of my belief: that is, what\nit is in the world that my belief is about. The things my beliefs are\nabout can be as ‘objective’ as the things I perceive. So\nwhat is distinctive of the dependence of perceptual experience on its\nobjects? One answer is that when an object is perceptually experienced, it\nis experienced as “there”, “given” or\n“present to the mind” in a way in which it is not in\nbelief, thought and many other mental states and events. Experience\nseems to involve a particular kind of “presence to the\nmind”. This “presence” goes beyond the mere fact\nthat the objects of experience must exist in order for the experience\nto be veridical. For the objects of knowledge must exist too, but\nstates of knowledge do not, as such, have presence in the same way as\nperceptual experiences—except, of course, in the case when one\nknows something is there by perceiving it. (Compare here the\nphenomenon Scott Sturgeon calls “scene immediacy” (2000:\nChapter 1)). So what is this perceptual presence? Compare perceptual experience\nwith pure thought. Pure thought, like experience, goes straight out to\nthe world itself. But a difference between them is that in the case of\nthought, how the object of thought is at the moment one is thinking of\nit does not in any way constrain one’s thinking of it; but in the case\nof perception it does. One’s perception of a snow covered\nchurchyard is immediately responsive to how the churchyard is now, as\none is perceiving it. But one’s (non-perceptual) thought need\nnot be: in the middle of winter, one can imagine the churchyard as it\nis in spring, covered in autumn leaves, and one can think of it in all\nsorts of ways which are not the ways it presently is. This is not\navailable in perception, because perception can only confront what is\npresently given: in this sense, it seems that you can only see or hear\nor touch what is there. It is because of this that perception is\nsometimes said to have an immediacy or vividness which thought lacks:\nthis vividness derives from the fact that perceived objects and their\nproperties are actually given to the perceiver when being perceived,\nand determine the nature of the character of the experience. Openness is the combination of Mind-Independence,\nand Presence. It is most clearly understood when it applies\nto those perceptual experiences involved in genuine perception (e.g.,\nwhen one sees a snow covered churchyard for what it is). But we\nunderstand Openness as applying more broadly to even\nperceptual experiences which don’t involve perceptual contact\nwith the world. This is why we have formulated it in terms of the\npresentation ‘(as) of’ ordinary objects. For instance,\ntake pure hallucinations of the sort we will consider in \n§2.2 below. Suppose one has an hallucination of a\nsnow covered churchyard for what it is, even when there is no such\nchurchyard there to be perceived. Here, Mind-Independence\ncharacterizes one’s experience. For one’s experience is\nstill as of a public mind-independent scene: the\napparent objects of such hallucinatory experiences are\nordinary objects. And, in a sense, Presence holds. The\nhallucination is, in its character as of the snow covered\nchurchyard, and the churchyard seems to be there, present to\none, such that the character of the experience is constrained by that\napparent scene. Some recent writers on perception have defended a thesis which has\nbecome known as the transparency of experience (see Harman (1990);\nSpeaks (2009); Tye (1992, 1995, 2000); Thau (2002); and for critical\ndiscussions of this idea, Martin (2002), Smith (2008), Stoljar (2004)\nand Soteriou (2013)). Transparency is normally defined as the\nthesis that reflection on, or introspection of, what it is like to\nhave an experience does not reveal that we are aware of experiences\nthemselves, but only of their mind-independent objects. There are two\nclaims here: (i) introspection reveals the mind-independent objects of\nexperience, and (ii) introspection does not reveal non-presentational\nfeatures of experience (that is, features of the character of\nexperience not traceable merely to the appearance of some object or\nfeature in the environment). Transparency is similar to Openness. The latter\nclaim does involve something like (i). But Transparency is\nnot the same as Openness, for it is not obvious that (ii) is\npart of our intuitive conception of experience. We do not have to hold\nthat the phenomenal character of experience is exhausted (or\ncompletely determined) by the nature of the objects and qualities\nwhich are presented in experience. This claim can be disputed. For\nexample, a scene can look very different when one removes one’s\nglasses: one’s visual experience of the churchyard then becomes\nhazy and blurred. But it can be argued that this phenomenal difference\nin experience need not derive from any apparent or represented\ndifference in the objects of experience. Rather, it seems to be a\ndifference in the way in which those objects are experienced\n(although see Tye (2000) for a different understanding of this\nphenomenon). So there are reasons for thinking that (ii) is not part\nof the common sense conception of experience. (For further discussion\non seeing blurrily see Smith (2008), Allen (2013), and French\n(2014). For a different challenge to (ii) see Richardson (2010) and\nSoteriou (2013: Chapter 5)). Openness can characterize perceptual experience which\ndoesn’t involve genuine perceptual contact with the world. But\nit is part of our ordinary way of thinking about perceptual experience\nthat we sometimes make perceptual contact with the world. Thus, we\ncome to the second component of our ordinary conception of perceptual\nexperience: \nAwareness: perceptual experience sometimes gives\nus perceptual awareness of ordinary mind-independent\nobjects. \nFor instance, in seeing a snow covered churchyard for what it is, one\nhas a visual experience, and is visually aware of a snow covered\nchurchyard. (Here we understand perception as a conscious\nstate or event—as something which is or involves perceptual\nexperience—which is a mode of awareness). The Problem of Perception is that if illusions and\nhallucinations are possible, then perception, as we ordinarily\nunderstand it, is impossible. The Problem is animated by two\ncentral arguments: the argument from illusion\n (§2.1) and the argument from hallucination\n(§2.2). (A similar problem has also\nbeen raised with reference to other perceptual phenomena such\nas perspectival variation or conflicting appearances, on which\nsee Burnyeat (1979) and the entry on\n sense-data). For some classic\nreadings on these arguments, see Moore (1905, 1910); Russell\n(1912); Price (1932); Broad (1965); and Ayer (1940), see\nSwartz (1965) for a good collection of readings. And for some\nfairly recent expositions see Snowdon (1992), Robinson (1994:\nChapter 2); Smith (2002: Chapters 1 and 7), and Martin\n(2006). In this section we present the arguments from illusion and\nhallucination both as challenging Awareness. That’s bad\nenough for our intuitive conception of perceptual experience, but it\ngets worse: for later we’ll see how the arguments can be\nsupplemented so as they support the rejection of Openness too\n(§3.1). According to Awareness, we are sometimes perceptually\naware of ordinary mind-independent objects in perceptual\nexperience. Such awareness can come from veridical\nexperiences—cases in which one perceives an object for what it\nis. But it can also come from illusory experiences. For we think of an\nillusion as “any perceptual situation in which a physical object\nis actually perceived, but in which that object perceptually appears\nother than it really is” Smith (2002: 23). For example, a white\nwall seen in yellow light can look yellow to one. (In such cases it is\nnot necessary that one is deceived into believing that things are\nother than they are). The argument from illusion, in a radical form,\naims to show that we are never perceptually aware of ordinary\nobjects. Many things have been called “the argument from\nillusion”. But the basic idea goes as follows: Four immediate comments on this are in order: First, as it stands\nthis is an inadequate representation of the argument as it conceals\nthe complex moves usually invoked by proponents and expositors, but\nwe’ll try to improve on this soon (in particular, a fuller\nversion includes a mini argument for (A)). Second, it is useful to\nrepresent the argument in this basic form to begin with as it enables\nus to highlight its two major movements; what Paul Snowdon calls the\nbase case, and the spreading step (Snowdon 1992). In the base case a\nconclusion about just illusory experiences is sought: namely, (A). In\nthe spreading step, (B), this result is generalized so as to get\nconclusion (C). Third, as we’re representing the argument here\nit is purely negative. But many philosophers have moved from this to\nthe further conclusion that since we are always aware of something in\nperceptual experience, what we are aware of is a\n“non-ordinary” object (sometimes called a\n“sense-datum”). In §3.1, we will\nexamine this further development. Finally, this argument is\nradical in that it concludes that we are never perceptually\naware of ordinary objects. A less radical version concludes instead\nthat we are never directly aware of ordinary objects, but for\nall that we may be indirectly aware of them. We’ll\nreturn briefly to this less radical version of the argument in\n §3.1 below. For now we’ll set aside\ncomplications to do with direct and indirect awareness.  Moving beyond the simple formulation, the argument from illusion\nis typically presented as involving these steps: This improves on the simple version of the argument in having both\na fuller base case stage and a fuller spreading step. That is, the\nbasis of premise (A) is made clear, and the spreading from (B) is\nexpanded. The most controversial premise in the argument is premise (ii). The\nother premises just reflect intuitive ways of thinking about\nperceptual experience, and so are unlikely to be targeted by one\nseeking to reject the argument from illusion. This is clear enough\nwith premises (i) and (vi), but what about premise (iv)? What this\nmeans is that the account of the nature and objects of illusory and\nveridical experiences must be the same. Though it may be disputed,\nthis premise seems plausible. For veridical and illusory experiences\nboth seem to be cases where one is aware of an ordinary object. The\nonly difference is that in the illusory case, but not in the veridical\ncase, the object one is aware of appears some way other than it in\nfact is.   Premise (ii) is what Howard Robinson has usefully labelled the\n“Phenomenal Principle”: C.D. Broad motivates this principle on\nexplanatory grounds. In cases of perceptual experience things appear\nsome ways rather than others to us. We need to explain this. Why does\nthe penny one sees look elliptical to one as opposed to some other\nshape? One answer is that there is something of which one is aware\nwhich is in fact elliptical. Thus as Broad says “If, in fact,\nnothing elliptical is before my mind, it is very hard to understand\nwhy the penny should seem elliptical rather than of any other\nshape.” (1923: 240). Other philosophers have simply taken the\nprinciple to be obvious. H.H. Price, for example, says that\n“When I say ‘this table appears brown to me’ it is\nquite plain that I am acquainted with an actual instance of\nbrownness” (Price 1932: 63).  So much for the argument’s main premises. How is it supposed\nto work? Here we find the suggestion that it hinges on an application\nof Leibniz’s Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals (Robinson\n(1994: 32); Smith (2002: 25)). The point is that (i) and (ii) tell us\nthat in an illusory experience one is aware of an F thing,\nbut the ordinary object supposedly being perceived is not F,\nthus the F thing one is aware of and the ordinary object are\nnot identical, by Leibniz’s Law. On these grounds, the\nconclusion of the base case stage is supposed to follow. And then the\nultimate conclusion of the argument can be derived from its further\npremises.  But as French and Walters (forthcoming) argue,\nthis is invalid. (i), (ii) and Leibniz’s Law entail that in an\nillusory experience one is directly aware of an F thing which\nis non-identical to the ordinary object supposedly being\nperceived. But this doesn’t entail that in the illusion one is\nnot directly aware of the ordinary object. One might be aware of the\nordinary object as well as the F thing one is aware\nof. We should be careful to distinguish not being (directly) aware of\nthe wall from being (directly) aware of something which is not the\nwall. The argument is invalid in conflating these two ideas. One option for fixing the argument is to introduce what French and\nWalters call the Exclusion Assumption (cf., Snowdon (1992: 74)):  This assumption bridges the gap between the conclusion actually\nachieved: \n(iii*) in an illusory experience one is aware of an F\nthing non-identical to the ordinary object  and the desired conclusion (iii). But whether this assumption is\ndefensible remains to be seen. In the remainder we leave this and the\nissue of validity aside and consider responses from different theories\nof experience. A hallucination is an experience which seems exactly like a\nveridical perception of an ordinary object but where there is no such\nobject there to be perceived. Like illusions, hallucinations in this\nsense do not necessarily involve deception. And nor need they be like\nthe real hallucinations suffered by the mentally ill, drug-users or\nalcoholics. They are rather supposed to be merely possible events:\nexperiences which are indistinguishable for the subject from a genuine\nperception of an object. For example, suppose one is now having a\nveridical perception of a snow covered churchyard. The assumption that\nhallucinations are possible means that one could have an experience\nwhich is subjectively indistinguishable—that is,\nindistinguishable by the subject, “from the\ninside”—from a veridical perception of a snow covered\nchurchyard, but where there is in fact no churchyard there to be\nperceived. (For more on hallucination, see the essays collected in\nMacpherson and Platchias (2013)). A radical form of the argument again challenges\nAwareness: What this argument shows, if it is successful, is that one is not\nperceptually aware of ordinary objects in veridical experiences. The\nconclusion here is not as general as the conclusion of the argument\nfrom illusion, but the more general conclusion is surely not far off:\nfor it would be difficult to maintain that though one is not\nperceptually aware of ordinary objects in veridical experiences, there\nare other cases of experience where one is perceptually aware of\nordinary objects. So this argument supports if not\nentails the rejection of our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience. Its aim is to show that an aspect of our\nordinary conception of perception is deeply problematic, if not\nincoherent: perceptual experience cannot be what we intuitively think\nit is. (It is essentially this problem which Valberg (1992) calls\n“the puzzle of experience”.) But as with the argument from\nillusion, the argument can be developed, in supplemented form, to\ndefend the conclusion that we only ever perceptually aware of\n“non-ordinary” objects (see\n §3.1).  Once again we can view the argument as having a base case (A) and\na spreading step (B) (Snowdon 2005). Unlike with the argument from\nillusion, the base case here is less controversial: it doesn’t\nrely on the Phenomenal Principle. We thus don’t need a more\ncomplicated argument to support it. (A) simply falls out of what\nhallucinations are supposed to be, and two principles: first, that\nawareness of an object is a relation to an object, and second, that\nrelations entail the existence of their relata. For given our\nprinciples, if an hallucination as of an ordinary object is to be a\nmode of awareness of an ordinary object then there must be an ordinary\nobject there for one to perceive. But no such objects are there in\nhallucinations, therefore, hallucinations are not cases of awareness\nof ordinary objects. Where the argument from hallucination is controversial is in the\nspreading step. The spreading step here gets construed in terms of the\nidea that veridical experiences and hallucinations are essentially the\nsame; mental events of the same fundamental kind (Martin\n(2006)). (This doesn’t mean that we lose a distinction between\nveridical experiences and hallucinations. It just means that the\ndifference between veridical experience and hallucination is not to be\nfound in their intrinsic natures). This claim seems plausible, as from\na subject’s perspective an hallucination cannot be told apart\nfrom a veridical experience. Thus some will accept (B) and thus deny\nthat we are ever perceptually aware of ordinary objects (see\nsense-datum theories §3.1), and others will\naccept (B) but argue that we can still have perceptual awareness of\nordinary objects (see intentionalist theories\n §3.3). But as we’ll see, others will want\nto secure perceptual awareness of ordinary objects by rejecting (B)\nand holding that hallucinations and veridical experiences are\nfundamentally different (see naive realist theories and disjunctivism\n§3.4).  Though it is not plausible to deny the possibility of illusory\nexperiences (though we may argue about how best to construe them;\nAnthony (2011) and Kalderon (2011)), the claim that subjectively\nindistinguishable hallucinations are possible is a little more\ncontroversial. How do we really know that experiences like this are\npossible? (Austin (1962), for instance, expresses scepticism). One way\nto answer this—though certainly not the only way—is to\nappeal to a broad and uncontroversial empirical fact about experience:\nthat it is the upshot or outcome of a causal process linking the\norgans of perception with the environment, that our experiences are\nthe effects of things going on inside and outside our bodies. If this\nis so, then we can understand why hallucinations are a\npossibility. For any causal chain reaching from a cause C1\nto effect E, there are intermediate causes C2,\nC3 etc., such that E could have been brought about even if\nC1 had not been there but one of the later causes (see the\nentry on\n the metaphysics of causation). \nIf this is true of causal processes in general, and\nperceptual experience is the product of a causal process, then we can\nsee how it is possible that I could have an experience of the\nchurchyard which was brought about by causes “downstream”\nof the actual cause (the churchyard). (This plays into the causal\nargument discussed in §3.4).  In this section we will consider the leading theories of experience\nof the last hundred years. These theories are understood here as\nresponses to the Problem of Perception. (There are a number of\ntheories of perception which are not discussed in this entry, either\nbecause they are not responses to this specific problem (like the\ncausal theory of Grice (1961) and Lewis (1988), and Burge (2010)) or\nbecause they require an entire entry of their own (like the\nphenomenology of Husserl (1900–1) and Merleau-Ponty (1945); see\nthe entry on phenomenology)).\n  As we understand theories of experience, they operate on two\nlevels. On one level they tell us about the nature or structure of\nexperience, on another level they tell us how what is said at the\nfirst level bears on grounding or explaining the phenomenal character\nof experience. Crudely, and with details and qualifications to\nexplored below: The Sense-Datum Theory: Level 1: experience is\nfundamentally a relation to a non-ordinary object; a\nsense-datum. Level 2: the character of experience is explained by\nthe real presence of sense-data and their qualities in experience\n(§3.1). The Adverbial Theory: Level 1: experience is\nnon-relational and fundamentally a state of mind adverbially\nmodified in a certain way (e.g., visually sensing brownly). Level 2:\nthe character of experience is explained by the intrinsic qualities\nof experience which constitute the ways in which it is modified\n (§3.2). The Intentionalist Theory: Level 1: experience is\nnon-relational and fundamentally a matter of representing ordinary\nobjects in certain ways. Level 2: the character of experience is\nexplained by its representational nature\n (§3.3). The Naive Realist Theory: Level 1: experience is\nfundamentally a relation to ordinary aspects of mind-independent\nreality. Level 2: the character of experience is explained by the\nreal presence of ordinary aspects of mind-independent reality in\nexperience (§3.4).  (In this exposition we do not consider much the possibility of\nmixed or hybrid views). \nHere is what we find: The sense-datum theorist rejects our ordinary\nconception of perceptual experience. The adverbial theorist tries to\nimprove upon the sense-datum theory, and holds on to\nAwareness. But it is unclear how they can secure\nOpenness. Intentionalists and naive realists hold to both\nOpenness and Awareness, but they do so in different\nways, and with different responses to the Problem of Perception. (The\nway these positions emerge in response to the Problem of Perception is\nmapped most clearly in Martin (1995, 1998, 2000)).\n On the sense-datum theory, a perceptual experience in which\nsomething appears F to one consists in a relation of\nperceptual awareness to something which is actually F (Level\n1). So whenever a subject has a sensory experience, there is something\nof which they are perceptually aware. This relational conception of\nexperience is sometimes called an “act-object” conception,\nsince it posits a distinction between the mental act of sensing, and\nthe object which is sensed.  A sense-datum theorist calls the object of an experience a\nsense-datum. We can thus re-formulate the Phenomenal Principle\nespoused by the sense-datum theorists in these terms: \nIf there sensibly appears to a subject to be something\nwhich possesses a particular sensible quality F then there is\nsomething—a sense-datum—of which the subject is directly\naware which does possess that sensible quality.  \nFor the sense-datum theorist, the character of an experience is\nsomehow explained (at least in part) by the sensible qualities of the\nsense-datum one is aware of. (Level 2). Consider an experience which\none would describe in terms of seeing a snow covered churchyard for\nwhat it is. We can isolate certain aspects of the phenomenal character\nof such an experience, such as the appearance of whiteness to one. We\nwant a theory of experience to explain such aspects. The sense-datum\ntheorist will claim that things appearing white to you consists in\nyour perceptual awareness of a white sense-datum. The character of\nyour experience is explained by an actual instance of whiteness\nmanifesting itself in experience. Now ultimately the sense-datum theory opposes our\nordinary conception of experience, but it doesn’t as\nwe have it so far. For at the moment we have no\nopposition between sense-data and ordinary objects. Suppose\nthat one has an experience of a churchyard as described above,\nand so one is perceptually aware of a white sense-datum. Now\nsuppose one’s experience is veridical. Well, for all\nwe’ve said, the sense-datum one is aware of could be an\nordinary bit of mind-independent reality: some white\nsnow. This is not ruled out, for a sense-datum is just\nwhatever it is that one is aware of in a perceptual\nexperience which instantiates the sensible qualities which\ncharacterize the phenomenology of one’s experience. All\nwe know about sense-data is that they must satisfy two\nconditions:  But paradigm sense-datum theories are, in contrast,\nnon-minimal. And such non-minimal sense-datum theorists do\nreject our ordinary conception of perceptual experience. We can make\nsense of this if we move to a less minimal conception of sense-data\nthemselves, on which they are not ordinary aspects of mind-independent\nreality. One option here is to articulate a theory of sense-experience\nand sense-data independently of the problem of perception (Jackson\n(1977) and Lowe (1992)). But by far the most popular approach for\nsense-datum theorists has been to move to a more committed conception\nof sense-data on the basis of arguments like the argument from\nillusion and the argument from hallucination. How does this work?  Take first the argument from illusion. Suppose one sees a white\nwall as yellow. The sense-datum theorist accepts the base case of the\nargument, along with Leibniz’s Law, and so holds that in the\nillusion one is aware of a yellow sense-datum which is not the\nwall. And suppose the illusion occurs in a world devoid of\nordinary objects which are in fact yellow. Thus the\nsense-datum is a non-ordinary object. Suppose we accept\nfurther that in illusions we are directly aware of such non-ordinary\nsense-data instead of and not as well as the relevant\nordinary objects. So illusions are cases where one is directly aware\nof just a non-ordinary sense-datum. With this the sense-datum\ntheorist accepts the spreading step and concludes that no perceptual\nexperience is a case of awareness of an ordinary object, and that\nillusory and veridical experiences are cases of awareness of\nnon-ordinary sense-data.   We can run a similar line of thought with the argument from\nhallucination. Suppose one has an hallucinatory experience as of a\nchurchyard covered in white snow. But there is no such churchyard\nthere to be perceived. The sense-datum theorist conceives of this\nexperience as a case of perceptual awareness of a white\nsense-datum. Suppose the hallucination occurs in a world devoid of\nordinary white things, so the sense-datum one is aware of is\na non-ordinary sense-datum. The sense-datum theorist then\nendorses the spreading step stage of argument to get the conclusion\nthat even in veridical experiences one is aware of just non-ordinary\nsense-data.  Initially, the arguments from illusion and hallucination were\npresented as aiming for a negative claim. But what we’ve seen\nhere is that the minimal sense-datum theorist can supplement the\nbase case with further considerations so as to get not just the\nnegative conclusion but a positive conclusion, which is itself\ngeneralised in the spreading step stage. That is, in combination:  The arguments, understood as such, are not arguments for the\nminimal sense-datum theory—the arguments presuppose\nsuch a theory. Rather, they serve as arguments for the transition from\nthe minimal form of the sense-datum theory to the non-minimal form\nwhich invokes non-ordinary sense-data.  From now on when we speak of “sense-data” we will mean\nnon-ordinary sense-data. Sense-datum theorists will divide over\nexactly how to understand sense-data insofar as they are\nnon-ordinary. The early sense-datum theorists (like Moore\n(1914)) considered sense-data to be mind-independent, but non-physical\nobjects. Later theories treat sense-data as mind-dependent entities\n(Robinson (1994)), and this is how the theory is normally understood\nin the second half of the twentieth century. What these different\nworkings out of the theory have in common, though, is that they stand\nopposed to our ordinary conception of perceptual experience in both\nits aspects. On the non-minimal sense-datum theory, perceptual\nexperiences are presentations not of ordinary objects, but of\nsense-data, and the character of experience, though dependent on its\nobjects, is thus dependent upon non-ordinary objects. Thus\nOpenness is false. The sense-datum theorist need not deny\nthat we are presented with objects as if they are ordinary\nobjects. But they will insist that this is an error. (So sense-datum\ntheories are not simply refuted (as Harman 1990 seems to argue) by\npointing to the phenomenological fact that the objects of experience\nseem to be the ordinary things around us). And in perceptual\nexperience we are not aware of ordinary objects but non-ordinary\nsense-data. Thus Awareness is false. Must a non-minimal sense-datum theorist deny Awareness? It\nseems not. Some sense-datum theorists introduce a distinction between\ndirect and indirect awareness. With this, they don’t deny that\nwe are ever perceptually aware of ordinary objects, only that we are\never directly perceptually aware of ordinary objects. The\nsense-datum theorist can say that we are indirectly aware of\nordinary objects: that is, aware of them by (in virtue of) being aware\nof sense-data. A sense-datum theorist who says this is known as an\nindirect realist or representative realist, or as someone who holds a\nrepresentative theory of perception (see Jackson (1977), Lowe (1992);\nsee also the entry on\n epistemological problems of perception).\n A theorist who denies that we are aware of\nmind-independent objects at all, directly or indirectly, but only of\nsense-data construed as mental entities, is known as a phenomenalist\nor an idealist about perception (see Foster (2000) for a recent\ndefence, see Crane and Farkas (2004: Section 2) for an introduction to\nthe subject; and the entry on\n idealism).  On the face of it the indirect realist form of the sense-datum\ntheory salvages something of our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience, but securing Awareness. But this\nshouldn’t be at all satisfying to one who wants to defend our\nintuitive conception of perceptual experience, for two reasons. First,\nOpenness is still being denied. Second, once we are given the\ndistinction between direct and indirect perception, a defender of our\nordinary conception of perceptual experience is likely to uphold\nAwareness in a more specific form, that is, as the idea that\nperceptual experience sometimes gives us direct awareness of\nordinary objects. That is, the main theories of experience which\nuphold our ordinary conception of perceptual\nexperience—intentionalism and naive realism—are both\nusually regarded as versions of direct realism.  The sense-datum theory was widely rejected in the second half of\nthe 20th century, though it still had its occasional\nchampions in this period (e.g., Jackson (1977), O’Shaughnessy\n(1980, 2000, 2003), Lowe (1992), Robinson (1994), Foster (2000)). A\nnumber of objections have been made to the theory. Some of these\nobjections are objections specifically to the indirect realist version\nof the sense-datum theory: for example, the claim that the theory\ngives rise to an unacceptable “veil of perception” between\nthe mind and the world. The idea is that the sense-data\n“interpose” themselves between perceivers and the\nmind-independent objects which we normally take ourselves to be\nperceiving, and therefore leaves our perceptual, cognitive and\nepistemic access to the world deeply problematic if not impossible. In\nresponse to this, the indirect realist can say that sense-data are the\nmedium by which we perceive the mind-independent world, and no more\ncreate a “veil of perception” than the fact that we use\nwords to talk about things creates a “veil of words”\nbetween us and the things we talk about. (For recent discussion see\nSilins (2011)). A common objection in contemporary philosophy is to attack the\nPhenomenal Principle (see Barnes (1944–5); Anscombe (1965)). The\nobjection is that the Phenomenal Principle is fallacious. It is not\nbuilt into the meaning of “something appears F to\none” that “one is aware of an F\nthing”. Defenders of the sense-datum theory can respond that the\nPhenomenal Principle is not supposed to be a purely logical inference;\nit is not supposed to be true simply because of the logical form or\nsemantic structure of “appears” and similar\nlocutions. Rather, it is true because of specific phenomenological\nfacts about perceptual experience. But this just means that theorists\nwho reject the Phenomenal Principle are not disagreeing about whether\nthe Phenomenal Principle involves a fallacy or about some semantic\nissue, but rather about the nature of experience itself.  Another influential objection to sense-data comes from the\nprevailing naturalism of contemporary philosophy. Naturalism (or\nphysicalism) says that the world is entirely physical in its nature:\neverything there is supervenes on the physical, and is governed by\nphysical law. Many sense-datum theorists are committed to the claim\nthat non-ordinary sense-data are mind-dependent: objects\nwhose existence depends on the existence of states of mind. Is this\nconsistent with naturalism? If so, the challenge is to explain how an\nobject can be brought into existence by the existence of an\nexperience, and how this is supposed to be governed by physical\nlaw. Many contemporary sense-datum theorists, however, will not be moved\nby this challenge, since they are happy to accept the rejection of\nnaturalism as a consequence of their sense-data theory (see Robinson\n1994, Foster 2000). On the other hand, one might think that there is\nno conflict here with naturalism, as long as experiences themselves\nare part of the natural order. But if sense-data are non-ordinary in\nbeing mind-independent but non-physical, then it is much less\nclear how naturalism can be maintained (cf., what Martin (2004, 2006)\ncalls “experiential naturalism” which serves as a\nconstraint on theories of experience and rules out some but not all\nforms of the sense-datum theory).  Some philosophers agree with the Phenomenal Principle that\nwhenever a sensory quality appears to be instantiated then it is\ninstantiated, but deny that this entails the existence of\nsense-data. Rather, they hold that we should think of these qualities\nas modifications of the experience itself (Level 1). Hence when\nsomeone has an experience of something brown, something like brownness\nis instantiated, but in the experience itself, not an object. This is\nnot to say that the experience is brown, but rather that the\nexperience is modified in a certain way, the way we can call\n“perceiving brownly”. The canonical descriptions of\nperceptual experiences, then, employ adverbial modifications of the\nperceptual verbs: instead of describing an experience as\nsomeone’s “visually sensing a brown square”, the\ntheory says that they are “visually sensing brownly and\nsquarely”. This is why this theory is called the\n“adverbial theory”; but it is important to emphasise that\nit is more a theory about the phenomenal character of experience\nitself (Level 2) than it is a semantic analysis of sentences\ndescribing experience.  Part of the point of the adverbial theory, as defended by Ducasse\n(1942) and Chisholm (1957) was to do justice to the phenomenology of\nexperience whilst avoiding the dubious metaphysical commitments the\nsense-datum theorists take on in responding to the Problem of\nPerception. The only entities which the adverbialist needs to\nacknowledge are subjects of experience, experiences themselves, and\nways these experiences are modified. This makes the theory appear less\ncontroversial than the sense-datum theory. When used in a broad way, “qualia” picks out whatever\nqualities a state of mind has which constitute the state of\nmind’s having the phenomenal character it has. In this broad\nsense, any conscious state of mind has qualia. (This is the way the\nterm is used in, e.g., Chalmers (1996)) Used in a narrow way, however,\nqualia are non-intentional, intrinsic properties of experience:\nproperties which have no intentional or representational aspects\nwhatsoever. To use Gilbert Harman’s apt metaphor, qualia in this\nsense are “mental paint” properties (1990). Harman rejects\nmental paint, the idea of experience as involving mental paint is\ntaken up and defended by Block (2004)).  It is relatively uncontroversial to say that there are qualia in\nthe broad sense. It can be misleading, however, to use the term in\nthis way, since it can give rise to the illusion that the existence of\nqualia is a substantial philosophical thesis when in fact it is\nsomething which will be accepted by anyone who believes in phenomenal\ncharacter. (Hence Dennett’s (1991) denial of qualia can seem\nbewildering if “qualia” is taken in the broad sense). It\nis controversial to say that there are qualia in the narrow sense,\nthough, and those who have asserted their existence have therefore\nprovided arguments and thought-experiments to defend this assertion\n(see Block (1997), Peacocke (1983 Chapter 1), Shoemaker (1990)). In\nwhat follows, “qualia” will be used exclusively in the\nnarrow sense.  The adverbial theory is committed to the view that experiencing\nsomething red, for example, involves one’s experience being\nmodified in a certain way: experiencing redly. The most natural way to\nunderstand this is that the experience is an event, and the\nmodification of it is a property of that event. Since this property is\nboth intrinsic (as opposed to relational or representational) and\nphenomenal (that is, consciously available) then this way of\nunderstanding the adverbial theory is committed to the existence of\nqualia.  An important objection to the adverbial theory has been proposed\nby Frank Jackson (1975). Consider someone who senses a brown square\nand a green triangle simultaneously. The adverbial theory will\ncharacterise this state of mind as “sensing brownly and squarely\nand greenly and triangularly”. But how can it distinguish the\nstate of mind it is describing in this way from that of sensing a\nbrown triangle and a green square? The characterisation fits that\nstate of mind equally well. Obviously, what is wanted is a description\naccording to which the brownness “goes with” the\nsquareness, and the greenness “goes with” the\ntriangularity. But how is the theory to do this without introducing\nobjects of experience—the things which are brown and green\nrespectively—or a visual field with a spatial structure? The\nchallenge is whether the adverbial theory can properly account for the\nspatial structure and complexity in what is given in visual\nexperience. (See Tye (1984) for an attempt to respond to this\nchallenge.)  A related objection concerns the relationship between the\nadverbial theory and our ordinary conception of experience. The\nadverbial theorist might admit that, in a sense, we are aware\nof ordinary objects. When one “senses redly“ if this state\nof mind is appropriately caused by a red thing (e.g., a tomato),\nperhaps this is what being aware of such an object amounts to. And it\nis not as if such awareness is indirect or mediated by\nsense-data. However, it is not at all clear that the adverbialist is\nin a position to secure Openness. For the adverbialist\nrejects not just the idea that experience has a genuine act-object\nstructure, but the idea that the character of experience is even a\npresentation as of ordinary things and qualities. Qualities\nget into the picture, and are constitutive of phenomenal character,\nbut not by being presented from outside of experience as qualities of\nthings, as Openness would have it. How, then, can the\nadverbialist account even for the appearance of an act-object\nstructure within experience, for Openness? It is unclear how\nthe adverbialist is to answer this question (see Martin (1998); Crane\n(2000)). And so it is unclear how much of an improvement the adverbial\napproach, and the qualia theory, is over the sense-datum theory. At Level 1, the intentional theory of experience treats perceptual\nexperience as a form of intentionality conceived of as a form of\nmental representation (hence it is also sometimes called the\nrepresentationalist theory of\nexperience). “Intentionality” is a term with its origins\nin scholastic philosophy (see Crane 1998b), but its current use\nderives from Brentano (1874), who introduced the term\n“intentional inexistence” for the “mind’s\ndirection upon its objects”. Intentional inexistence, or\nintentionality, is sometimes explained as the “aboutness”\nof mental states (see the entries on\n Franz Brentano,\n representational theories of consciousness\n and\n intentionality). An intentional mental\nstate is normally understood, therefore, as one which is about, or\nrepresents, something in the world. At Level 2, this is put to work in explaining phenomenal\ncharacter. Take an experience as of a churchyard covered in white\nsnow. Why is this a case of things appearing white to one? Here the\nintentionalist appeals to the experience’s representation of\nwhiteness in the environment. It is not generally true that when a\nrepresentation represents something as being F, there has to\nactually be something which is F. Thus for the\nintentionalist, experience is representational in a way that contrasts\nwith it being relational. Experience does not genuinely have an\nact-object structure. This is in keeping with a standard tradition in\nthe theory of intentionality which treats it as non-relational (the\ntradition derives from Husserl 1900/1901; for discussion see Zahavi\n2003: 13–27). So intentionalism contrasts with the sense-datum\ntheory: since it is not of the essence of experience or its character\nthat it is relational, it is not of its essence that it is a relation\nto a non-ordinary sense-datum.  The intentionalist can thus reject the argument from illusion in\nthe form presented in §2.1 and the supplemented\nform presented in §3.1.1. This is because\nthese arguments hinge on the minimal sense-datum theory, or the\nPhenomenal Principle which the intentional theory is an alternative\nto. An illusory experience in which a white wall appears yellow to one\nis thus not conceived of as a case in which one is aware of a yellow\nsense-datum. It is instead conceived of as a case in which a white\nwall is represented as being yellow. As we’ll see, the\nintentionalist can even maintain the intuitive idea that in such\nillusions one is aware of the ordinary objects one seems to be aware\nof—but that’s something we’ll come back to\nshortly.  What about hallucinations? Again the intentionalist can reject the\nsupplemented form of the argument from hallucination from\n §3.1.1 because this version of the argument\nrelies on the Phenomenal Principle. But what about the original form\nof the argument from hallucination? This argument does not rely on the\nPhenomenal Principle, yet its conclusion is that not even veridical\nexperiences give us direct awareness of ordinary mind-independent\nobjects. So how is the intentionalist to deal with this argument? The\nintentionalist accepts (A) but also (B) in a specific form. That is,\nthey accept (B) where that is understood in terms of what Martin\n(2004, 2006) has called the Common Kind Assumption, that is: \n(CKA) Whatever fundamental kind of mental event occurs\nwhen one veridically perceives, the very same kind of event could\noccur were one hallucinating.  \nTake a veridical perception of a white snow covered churchyard for\nwhat it is. The experience involved in this perception, the\nintentionalist thinks, is fundamentally a matter of experientially\nrepresenting the presence of a white snow covered churchyard. And this\nfundamental kind of mental event is exactly what is present in the\nsubjectively indistinguishable hallucinatory case, for such\nhallucinatory experiences have the same representational nature as\ntheir veridical counterparts.  But then doesn’t this mean that the intentionalist is saddled\nwith the conclusion of the argument from hallucination (C)? If so, the\nrejection of Awareness and our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience is not far off. Since if we are not perceptually\naware of ordinary objects in veridical experiences, it is unclear how\nany form of perceptual awareness of ordinary objects can be\nsecured. However, the intentionalist can distinguish between two readings of\nthe conclusion. On the first reading, we have \n(C*) veridical experiences are not fundamentally\ncases of awareness of ordinary objects. This is entailed by the argument as we have construed it. But what\nis not entailed is \n(C**) veridical experiences don’t give us\nperceptual awareness of ordinary objects.  As long as (C**) doesn’t follow, the intentionalist can\nsuggest, Awareness is secure. The intentionalist admits that\nnot even veridical experiences are fundamentally cases of perceptual\nawareness of ordinary objects. Such experiences are fundamentally\nrepresentational in a way that contrasts with them being\nrelational. But that simply doesn’t mean that we can’t\ncome to be perceptually aware, even directly perceptually\naware, of an ordinary object by having a veridical\nexperience. Veridical experiences may be the occasions for such\nawareness even if they are not themselves constituted by instances of\nsuch awareness. They can be occasions for such awareness precisely\nbecause they represent ordinary objects. In their very\ncharacter they are about, directed on, the mind-independent world (in\ncontrast to both sense-datum theories, and adverbialist theories). We\ncome to have (direct) perceptual awareness by having such experiences\nwhen the world also plays its part: when things in the world are as\nthey are represented to be in the experience, and when the world is\nhooked up to the experience in an appropriate way. This also helps us\nto see how even illusions can give us (direct) awareness of ordinary\nobjects. In these cases, experience represents an ordinary object\nwhich is there to be perceived, and it is appropriately related to\none’s experience, yet there is some misrepresentation of the\nobject. Thus the intentionalist can respond to Problem of Perception: it\nhas solutions to both arguments which animate the Problem. And the\nintentionalist response secures both aspects of our ordinary\nconception of perceptual experience. The intentionalist explains how\nexperience satisfies Openness in terms of it having a certain\nsort of representational nature. That is, a perceptual experience\ninvolves, in its very character, the presentation of ordinary\nmind-independent objects to a subject precisely because it is a matter\nof perceptual representation of ordinary aspects of the\nenvironment. And such aspects are represented as there,\npresent. The character of experience is immediately\nresponsive to the character of its objects because it is constituted,\nat least in part, by the way those objects are represented, at the\ntime they are experienced.  Some of the most influential intentional theories are Anscombe\n(1965), Armstrong (1968), Pitcher (1970), Peacocke (1983), Harman\n(1990), Tye (1992, 1995), Dretske (1995), Lycan (1996); for more\nrecent accounts, see Byrne (2001), Siegel (2010), Pautz (2010) and the\nentry on the contents of perception.  Within analytic philosophy, the intentionalist theory of\nperception is a generalisation of an idea presented by G.E.M. Anscombe\n(1965), and the “belief theories” of D.M. Armstrong (1968)\nand George Pitcher (1970). (Within the phenomenological tradition\nintentionality and perception had always been discussed together: see\nthe entry on phenomenology.) Anscombe\nhad drawn attention to the fact that perceptual verbs satisfy the\ntests for non-extensionality or intensionality (see the entry on\n intensional transitive verbs).\n For example, just as ‘Vladimir is thinking about\nPegasus’ is an intensional context, so ‘Vladimir has an\nexperience as of a pink elephant in the room’ is an intensional\ncontext. In neither case can we infer that there exists something\nVladimir is thinking about, or that there is exists something he is\nexperiencing. This is the typical manifestation of\nintensionality. Anscombe regarded the error of sense-data and naive\nrealist theories of perception as the failure to recognise this\nintensionality.  Armstrong and Pitcher argued that perception is a form of\nbelief. (More precisely, they argued that it is the acquisition of a\nbelief, since an acquisition is a conscious event, as perceiving is;\nrather than a state or condition, as belief is.) Belief is an\nintentional state in the sense that it represents the world to be a\ncertain way, and the way it represents the world to be is said to be\nits intentional content. Perception, it was argued, is similarly a\nrepresentation of the world, and the way it represents the world to be\nis likewise its intentional content. The fact that someone can have a\nperceptual experience that a is F without there\nbeing any thing which is F was taken as a reason for saying\nthat perception is just a form of belief-acquisition.  The belief theory of perception (and related theories, like the\njudgement theory of Craig (1976)) is a specific version of the\nintentional theory. But it is not the most widely accepted version\n(though see Glüer (2009) for a recent defence). Everyone will\nagree that perception does give rise to beliefs about the\nenvironment. But this does not mean that perception is simply the\nacquisition of belief. One obvious reason why it isn’t,\ndiscussed by Armstrong, is that one can have a perceptual illusion\nthat things are a certain way even when one knows they are not (this\nphenomenon is sometimes called “the persistence of\nillusion”). The famous Müller-Lyer illusion presents two\nlines of equal length as if they were unequal. One can experience this\neven if one knows (and therefore believes) that the lines are the same\nlength. If perception were simply the acquisition of belief, then this\nwould be a case of explicitly contradictory beliefs: one believes that\nthe lines are the same length and that they are different lengths. But\nthis is surely not the right way to describe this\nsituation. (Armstrong recognised this, and re-described perception as\na “potential belief”; this marks a significant retreat\nfrom the original claim). The intentionalist theory is, however, not\ncommitted to the view that perceptual experience is belief; experience\ncan be a sui generis kind of intentional state or event (see\nMartin 1992–3).  Intentionalists hold that what is in common between perceptions\nand indistinguishable hallucinations is their intentional content:\nroughly speaking, how the world is represented as being by the\nexperiences. Many intentionalists hold that the sameness of phenomenal\ncharacter in perception and hallucination is exhausted or constituted\nby this sameness in content (see Tye (2000), Byrne (2001)). But this\nlatter claim is not essential to intentionalism (see the discussion of\nintentionalism and qualia below). What is essential is that the\nintentional content of perception explains (whether wholly or partly)\nits phenomenal character.  The intentional content of perception is sometimes called\n“perceptual content” (see the entry on\n the contents of perception). What\nis perceptual content? A standard approach to intentionality treats\nall intentional states as propositional attitudes: states which are\nascribed by sentences of the form “S ___ that p” where\n‘S’ is to be replaced by a term for a subject,\n‘p’ with a sentence, and the ‘___’ with a\npsychological verb. The distinguishing feature of the propositional\nattitudes is that their content—how they represent the world to\nbe—is something which is assessable as true or false. Hence the\ncanonical form of ascriptions of perceptual experiences is: “S\nperceives/experiences that p”. Perception, on this kind of\nintentionalist view, is a propositional attitude (see Byrne (2001) for\na recent defence of this idea, see also Siegel (2010)). But intentionalism is not committed to the view that perception is\na propositional attitude. For one thing, it is controversial whether\nall intentional states are propositional attitudes (see Crane (2001:\nChapter 4)). Among the intentional phenomena there are relations like\nlove and hate which do not have propositional content; and there are\nalso non-relational states expressed by the so-called\n“intensional transitive” verbs like seek, fear, expect\n(see the entry on\n intensional transitive verbs).\n All these states of mind have contents which\nare not, on the face of it, assessable as true or false. If I am\nseeking a bottle of inexpensive Burgundy, what I am seeking—the\nintentional content of my seeking, or the intentional object under a\ncertain mode of presentation—is not something true or\nfalse. Some argue that these intentional relations and intentional\ntransitives are analysable or reducible to propositional formulations\n(see Larson (2003) for an attempt to defend this view of intensional\ntransitives; and Sainsbury (2010) for a less radical defence). But the\nmatter is controversial; and it is especially controversial where\nperception is concerned. For we have many ways of talking about\nperception which do not characterise its content in propositional\nterms: for example, “Vladimir sees a snail on the grass”,\nor “Vladimir is watching a snail on the grass” can be\ndistinguished from the propositional formulation “Vladimir sees\nthat there is a snail on the grass” (for an interesting recent\ndiscussion of watching, see Crowther 2009). There are those who follow\nDretske (1969) in claiming that these semantical distinctions express\nan important distinction between “epistemic” and\n“non-epistemic” seeing. However, the view that perceptual\ncontent is non-propositional is not the same as the view that it is\n“non-epistemic” in Dretske’s sense. For ascriptions\nof non-epistemic seeing are intended to be fully extensional in their\nobject positions, but not all non-propositional descriptions of\nperception need be (for example, some have argued that “Macbeth\nsaw a dagger before him” does not entail “there is a\ndagger which Macbeth saw”: cf. Anscombe (1965)). The question of\nwhether perception has a propositional content is far from being\nsettled, even for those who think it has intentional content (see\nMcDowell (2008); Crane (2009)).  Another debate about the content of perceptual\nexperience—independent of the issue of whether it is\npropositional—is whether it is singular or general in nature\n(see Soteriou (2000); and for a more general discussion, see Chalmers\n(2006)). A singular content is one that concerns a particular object,\nand such that it cannot be the content of a state of mind unless that\nobject exists. Singular contents are also called\n“object-dependent”. A general content is one whose ability\nto be the content of any intentional state is not dependent on the\nexistence of any particular object. General contents are also called\n“object-independent”. Those who think (like Snowdon\n(1992), McDowell (1994), Brewer (2000)) that the content of perceptual\nexperience can be expressed by a sentence containing an irreducible\ndemonstrative pronoun (e.g., of the form “that F is\nG’) will also argue that the content of experience is\nsingular; those who think (like Davies (1992) and McGinn (1989)) that\nthe content of experience is general (e.g., of the form, “there\nis an F which is G”) are committed to its\nobject-independence. It might seem that an intentionalist must say\nthat the content of perception is wholly general. However, Burge\n(1991) has argued that any genuinely perceptual episode has an\nirreducibly singular element, even though the episode could share a\ncomponent of content with a numerically distinct episode. Martin\n(2002) argues that the availability of this position shows that\nintentionalism could deny that the content of experience is wholly\ngeneral.  The issue about whether the content of perceptual experience is\nsingular or general is not simply about whether the existence of the\nexperience entails or presupposes the existence of its object. An\nexample will illustrate this. Suppose for the sake of argument that\nexperience essentially involves the exercise of recognitional\ncapacities, and I have a capacity to recognise the Queen. Let’s\nsuppose too that this is a general capacity which presupposes her\nexistence. It is consistent with this to say that I could be in the\nsame intentional state when I am hallucinating the Queen, as when I am\nperceiving her. Although the capacity might depend for its existence\non the Queen’s existence, not every exercise of the capacity\nneed depend on the Queen’s presence. The capacity can\n“misfire”. Hence intentionalism can hold that experiences\nare the same in the hallucinatory and veridical cases, even though the\nexistence of the involved recognitional capacity presupposes the\nexistence of the object recognised.  The objects of intentional states are sometimes called\n“intentional objects” (Crane (2001: Chapter 1)). What are\nthe intentional objects of perceptual experience, according to\nintentionalists? In the case of veridical perception, the answer is\nsimple: ordinary, mind-independent objects like the churchyard, the\nsnow (etc.) and their properties. But what should be said about the\nhallucinatory case? Since this case is by definition one in which\nthere is no mind-independent object being perceived, how can we even\ntalk about something being an “object of experience” at\nall here? As noted above, intentionalists say that experiences are\nrepresentations; and one can represent what does not exist (see Harman\n(1990), Tye (1992)). This is certainly true; but isn’t there any\nmore to be said? For how does a representation of a non-existent\nchurchyard differ from a representation of a non-existent garbage\ndump, say, when one of those is hallucinated? The states seem to have\ndifferent objects; but neither of these objects exist (see the entry\nnonexistent-objects).   One proposal is that the objects of hallucinatory experience are\nthe properties which the hallucinated object is presented as having\n(Johnston (2004)). Another answer is to say that these hallucinatory\nstates of mind have intentional objects which do not exist (Smith\n(2002: Chapter 9)). Intentional objects in this sense are not supposed\nto be entities or things of any kind. When we talk about perception\nand its “objects” in this context, we mean the word in the\nway it occurs in the phrase “object of thought” or\n“object of attention” and not as it occurs in the phrase\n“physical object”. An intentional object is always an\nobject for a subject, and this is not a way of classifying things in\nreality. An intentionalist need not be committed to intentional\nobjects in this sense; but if they are not, then they owe an account\nof the content of hallucinatory experiences.  How does the content of perceptual experience differ from the\ncontent of other intentional states? According to some\nintentionalists, one main difference is that perception has\n“non-conceptual” content. The basic idea is that\nperception involves a form of mental representation which is in\ncertain ways less sophisticated than the representation involved in\n(say) belief. For example, having the belief that the churchyard is\ncovered in snow requires that one have the concept of a\nchurchyard. This is what it means to say that belief has conceptual\ncontent: to have the belief with the content that a is\nF requires that one possess the concept a and the\nconcept F. So to say perception has non-conceptual content is\nto say the following: to have a perception with the content that\na is F does not require that one have the concept of\na and the concept F. The idea is that one’s\nperceptual experience can represent the world as being a certain\nway—the “a is F” way—even if\none does not have the concepts that would be involved in believing\nthat a is F. (For a more detailed version of this\ndefinition, see Crane (1998a) and Cussins (1990); for a different way\nof understanding the idea of non-conceptual content, see Heck (2000)\nand Speaks (2005). The idea of non-conceptual content derives from\nEvans (1982); there are some similar ideas in Dretske (1981); see\nGunther (2002) for a collection of articles on this subject. Other\nsupport for non-conceptual content can be found in Bermúdez\n(1997); Peacocke (1992); Crowther (2006); for opposition see Brewer\n(2000) and McDowell (1994a)).  Critics of the intentional theory have argued that it does not\nadequately distinguish perceptual experience from other forms of\nintentionality, and therefore does not manage to capture what is\ndistinctive about experience itself. (McDowell (1994), Martin (2002),\nRobinson (1994: 164)).  One objection of this kind is that intentionalists can give no\naccount of the qualitative or sensory character of perceptual\nexperience. Experiencing something, unlike thinking about it, has a\ncertain “feel” to it. Yet, the objection runs,\nintentionalism has no resources to deal with this fact, since it\nexplains experience in terms of representation, and merely\nrepresenting something need have no particular “feel”\nwhatsoever. Believing that something is the case, for example, or\nhoping that something is the case, are both forms of mental\nrepresentation, but neither state of mind has any “feel”\nor qualitative character to call its own. (Words or images may come to\nmind when mentally representing something in this way, but it is not\nobvious that these are essential to the states of mind themselves.) So\nthe challenge is the following: if there is nothing about\nrepresentation as such which explains the “feel” of an\nexperience, how is experience supposed to be distinguished from mere\nthought?  There are a number of ways an intentionalist can respond. One is\nsimply to take it as a basic fact about perceptual intentionality that\nit has a qualitative or phenomenal character (see Kriegel\n(2013)). After all, this response continues, even those who believe in\nqualia have to accept that some states of mind have qualia and some do\nnot, and that at some point the distinction between mental states\nwhich are conscious/qualitative, and those which are not, just has to\nbe accepted as a brute fact.  Another response is to say that in order to explain the phenomenal\ncharacter of perceptual experience, we need to treat perception as\ninvolving non-intentional qualia as well as intentionality (see\nPeacocke (1983: Chapter 1); Shoemaker (1993); Block (1997)). There is,\naccordingly, a dispute between these intentionalists who accept qualia\n(like Block and Shoemaker) and those who don’t (like Harman\n(1990) or Tye (1992)). The first kind of intentionalist holds that in\naddition to its intentional properties, perceptual experience also\ninvolves qualia; the second kind denies this. (See the discussion of\n“the transparency of experience” in\n §1.1.3 above; and see Spener (2003)).  Consider the inverted spectrum argument (see the entry on\n inverted qualia). This argument is\nbased on an ancient speculation: that it is possible that two\npeople’s colour experience could vary massively and\nsystematically and that this difference be undetectable from the third\nperson perspective (see Shoemaker (1996)). For example, consider two\npeople Alice and Bob, whose colour perceptions are inverted relative\nto one another. Whenever Alice sees something red, Bob sees something\nblue and vice versa. Yet Alice and Bob each call all the same things\n“red”, and arguably believe that all the same things are\nred (fire engines, poppies etc.). It can further be argued that the\nrepresentational or intentional content of their belief that fire\nengines are red is derived from the representational content of their\nexperiences of red fire engines, since this belief is a perceptual\nbelief. What then explains their mental difference? Defenders of\nqualia say that what explains this is the difference in the qualia of\ntheir mental states. Alice and Bob are intentionally or\nrepresentationally identical—they represent the world in the\nsame way—they differ in the non-representational qualia of their\nexperience. (Intentionalists who deny qualia will dispute this by\nsaying that the difference between Alice and Bob is indeed a\nrepresentational difference: see Tye (2000) and Hilbert and Kalderon\n(2000). For more on the inverted spectrum, see Block (2007), Egan\n(2006), Marcus (2006). For other arguments attempting to establish\nqualia, see Block (1997), (2010), Peacocke (1983)). Consider the veridical experiences involved in cases of perception;\ncases where one genuinely sees or otherwise perceives an object for\nwhat it is. Like sense-datum theorists, and unlike intentionalists,\nnaive realists hold that such experiences themselves consist of\nrelations of awareness to objects. However, like intentionalists,\nnaive realists reject sense-data and appeal instead to ordinary\nobjects. So the naive realist holds, in contrast to both the\nsense-datum theory and intentionalism (and, adverbialism), that the\nveridical experiences involved in genuine cases of perception consist,\nin their nature, of relations to ordinary objects (Level 1). And this\nis put to work in explaining the phenomenal character of such\nexperiences (Level 2). Take the churchyard covered in white snow and\nsuppose one sees this for what it is. Why is this a case of things\nappearing white to one? Here the naive realist appeals to the real\npresence in the experience of the white snow itself. The character of\none’s experience is explained by an actual instance of whiteness\nmanifesting itself in experience. For the naive realist, the character of the experience one has in\nseeing the churchyard for what it is is constituted in part by the\nwhiteness of the snow itself and not by the representation of\nsuch whiteness where representation is understood as it is by the\nintentionalist: that is, where an experience’s representation of\nsomething as white is something which doesn’t require the\npresence of an actual instance of whiteness. And many naive realists\ndescribe the relation at the heart of their view as a\nnon-representational relation. This means that many naive\nrealists think of experience and its character as non-representational\nin this sense: (a) intentional content of the sort appealed to by the\nintentionalists to explain character is not appealed to, and (b) what\nis fundamental to experience is something which itself cannot\nexplained in terms of representing the world: a primitive relation of\nawareness to aspects of the world.  But care is needed here, for two reasons. First, neither (a) nor\n(b) entail that experience is non-representational tout\ncourt, that experiences don’t have representational\ncontent. For one might think of experience as representational in a\nway that is not tied to explaining phenomenal character (for instance\ncontent might be needed to explain experience’s epistemic\nrole). If one thought of experience as contentful in a way that is not\ntied to explaining character, that would not be to endorse\nintentionalism, nor would it be to reject (a) or (b). And second,\nMcDowell (2013) seems to be a naive realist who rejects (b), for he\nthinks that experience is relational in virtue of being contentful in\na certain way—a way which thus contrasts with the way in which\nexperience is contentful on non-relational views such as\nintentionalism.  (For further discussion see the articles in\nBrogaard (2014)).  The most prominent form of naive realism invokes (a) and (b). Such\nnaive realists assign an important explanatory role to the world\nitself, without the involvement of content, in explaining the\ncharacter of veridical experiences. It would be a mistake, however, to\nthink that such naive realists must think of veridical experiences as\nconsisting just in a simple two-place relation between a perceiver and\na worldly subject-matter whereby phenomenal character is constituted\nentirely by the presented subject-matter. This would mean that there\ncould be no variation in the phenomenal character without a variation\nin the presented subject-matter. But naive realists admit that even\nholding fixed the presented subject-matter there can be variation in\nthe character of experience. This is worked out in different (but\ncompatible) ways by different theorists. One approach is to keep the\nsimple two-place view, yet note how variations in the perceiver\nrelatum can make for variations in the character of experience (Logue\n(2012)). Another is to highlight a third-relatum which encapsulates\nvarious conditions of perception such as one’s spatiotemporal\nperspective, perceptual modality, and other conditions of perception\nvariation in which can make for variation in phenomenal character\n(Campbell (2009), Brewer (2011)). It makes sense to suppose that if a\ngiven experience is of a subject-matter from a certain viewpoint\n(Martin (1998)), or standpoint (Campbell (2009)), then variation in\nwhat goes into one having the particular viewpoint or standpoint one\nhas should make for variation in the phenomenal character. And we also\nneed to look at the relation of awareness itself. Many naive realists\nhold that there can be variation in the way or\nmanner in which one is related to a subject-matter which\nmakes a difference to phenomenal character (Soteriou (2013), Campbell\n(2014)). Thus naive realists will reject the transparency thesis as it\nis discussed in §1.1.3, specifically (ii).  Like intentionalists, naive realists want to maintain our ordinary\nconception of perceptual experience. They hold to both\nAwareness and Openness. Naive realists think that we\nare sometimes perceptually aware of ordinary objects: that’s\nwhat we have in veridical and illusory experiences (see\n §3.4.2). Such experiences are cases of\nsuch awareness. And perceptual experience satisfies\nOpenness. In veridical and illusory experiences, the\ncharacter of experience is a presentation of ordinary objects, and is\nimmediately responsive to the character of such objects because such\nobjects are literally involved in the experience, part constitutive of\nits character.\n \nHow, then, does the naive realist respond to the arguments which\nanimate the Problem of Perception? There are various different approaches available to a naive realist\nhere (see e.g., Fish (2009: Chapter 6), Brewer (2008, 2011: Chapter\n5), Kalderon (2011), Genone (2014), Campbell (2014)). But one approach\nis to target the base case. Naive realists, like intentionalists, can\nreject the Phenomenal Principle: in illusions it appears to one as if\nsomething is F even though one is not aware of anything which\nis F. When one sees a white wall as yellow, what one is aware\nof is a white wall, and that is not yellow. So how does naive realism\ndiffer from intentionalism about illusions? In two respects: first,\nnaive realists can group illusory experiences with veridical\nexperiences to the extent that they think of them as fundamentally\ncases of non-representational relations of awareness to ordinary\nobjects. Second, the naive realist can explain the character of such\nillusory experiences without appeal to intentional content, but\ninstead by appealing to ordinary objects, and their features. On this\nsecond difference, one approach is that developed by Brewer: So though o may not itself be F, it can exist in\ncertain conditions, C, such that it has visually relevant\nsimilarities to paradigm F things and in that sense it will\nobjectively look F, or look like an F\nthing—that is, it will itself have a property, a look or an\nappearance, independently of anyone actually clapping their eyes upon\nit (see also Martin (2010), Kalderon (2011) and Genone (2014) on\nobjective looks). If o is then seen in C, o\nitself will look F to one in perception. Brewer spells this\nall out in much more detail, and with various examples. One example is\nseeing a white piece of chalk as red. The chalk is seen in abnormal\nillumination conditions such that the white piece of chalk itself\nlooks like a paradigm red piece of chalk—it has ’visually\nrelevant similarities with a paradigm piece of chalk, of just that\nsize and shape’ (2011: 106). Given that it is seen in those\nconditions, it looks red to one, even though it is not in\nfact red. Here, then, we have an account of illusions in which we\nappeal to objects and the ways those objects are, not the ways the are\nrepresented to be, in explaining character. How does the naive realist deal with the argument from\nhallucination? The naive realist denies its conclusion (C) and unlike\nthe intentionalist wants to deny (C) read as \n(C*) veridical experiences are not fundamentally cases of\nperceptual awareness of ordinary objects.  They accept (A) and so block the argument by rejecting the\nspreading step (B) ((he Common Kind Assumption (CKA)). Suppose that,\nas the naive realist holds, when one sees a snow covered churchyard\nfor what it is, one has an experience which is in its nature a\nrelation between oneself and ordinary objects. Whatever an\nhallucinatory experience as of a snow covered churchyard is, it is not\nan event with that nature. For such a hallucination could\noccur quite apart from any relevant worldly items (e.g., in the lab of\na scientist manipulating your brain, in a world with no white\nthings). Instead of taking (B) and these facts about hallucinations as\ngrounds to reject the supposition of naive realism, the naive realist\ninstead gives up (B)/(CKA) and thinks of veridical experiences and\nhallucinatory experiences as of different fundamental kinds. (For a\nmuch more nuanced and detailed formulation of the naive realist\nthinking here, see Martin (2004), (2006)).  In blocking the argument from hallucination in this way the naive\nrealist takes on a disjunctive theory. The theory was first proposed\nby Hinton (1973) and was later developed by P.F. Snowdon (1979, 1990),\nJohn McDowell (1982, 1987) and M.G.F. Martin (2002, 2004,\n2006). Disjunctivism is not best construed as it is by one of its\nproponents, as the view “that there is nothing literally in\ncommon” in perception and hallucination, “no identical\nquality” (Putnam (1999: 152)). For both the perception of an\nX and a subjectively indistinguishable hallucination of an\nX are experiences which are subjectively indistinguishable\nfrom a perception of an X. What disjunctivists deny is that\nwhat makes it true that these two experiences are describable\nin this way is the presence of the same fundamental kind of mental\nstate. Disjunctivists reject what J.M. Hinton calls “the\ndoctrine of the ‘experience’ as the common element in a\ngiven perception” and an indistinguishable hallucination (Hinton\n(1973: 71)). The most fundamental common description of both states,\nthen, is a merely disjunctive one: the experience is either a genuine\nperception of an X or a mere hallucination of an\nX. Hence the theory’s name. But what support is there for the disjunctivist’s rejection\nof (CKA)? Some defenders of disjunctivism have claimed that there is a\nrelatively simple argument against the (CKA). Putnam, for example, has\nargued that since the common kind is defined by subjective\nindistinguishability, and since subjective indistinguishability is not\ntransitive, then it cannot define a sufficient condition for the\nidentity of states of mind, since identity is transitive (Putnam\n(1999: 130)). The argument that subjective indistinguishability is not\ntransitive derives from the so-called “phenomenal sorites”\nargument: the possibility that there could be a series of (say) colour\nsamples, arranged in a sequence such that adjacent pairs were\nsubjectively indistinguishable but that the first and last members of\nthe series were distinguishable. Hence sample 1 could be subjectively\nindistinguishable from sample 2, and so on; and sample 99 could be\nsubjectively indistinguishable from sample 100, but sample 1\nnonetheless be subjectively distinguishable from sample 100. Those who\nwant to defend (CKA) need, therefore, to respond to this argument; one\nway is to follow Graff (2001), and argue that the phenomenal sorites\nargument is in fact fallacious.   Taking a different approach, Martin (2002: 421) argues that each\nof the main theories of perception is an “error theory” of\nperception (in J.L. Mackie’s (1977) sense). That is, each theory\nconvicts common sense of an error about perception: for example, the\nsense-datum theory convicts common sense of making the erroneous\nassumption that perception is a direct awareness of mind-independent\nobjects. Against this background, Martin argues that abandoning (CKA)\nis the least revisionary position among all the possible responses to\nthe Problem of Perception, and thus follows Hinton (1973) in holding\nthe disjunctivist position to be the default starting point for\ndiscussions of perception. (A further approach is to be found in\nMcDowell (2008) who attempts to support disjunctivism on\nepistemological grounds.) Naive realism avoids the argument from hallucination by denying\n(CKA) and thus taking on disjunctivism. But some object to this and\ntry to support (CKA) with a so-called causal argument\n(Robinson (1994), Martin (2004, 2006), Nudds (2009, 2013)). Why might\none think that the kind of event that occurs in a veridical experience\nof a churchyard occurs in a subjectively indistinguishable\nhallucination? One way to justify this is with appeal to the idea that\nthe type of brain state which underpins each experiential occurrence\nis the same; the resulting experiences should thus be of the very same\nkind. That is, we can suppose that when S sees the snow\ncovered churchyard for what it is, there is some proximal cause of\nthis experience: the experience is preceded by a certain sort of brain\nstate B. But now we can imagine a situation in which we bring\nabout B thus producing an experience in S, yet where\nB is not brought about through any interaction between S\nand a snow covered churchyard—e.g., in laboratory\nconditions. In this scenario S has an hallucinatory\nexperience as of a snow covered churchyard. It is plausible to suppose\nthat these experiences are of the very same kind given that they have\nthe same proximal cause. Thus, (CKA). The point here is that (CKA)\nlooks like a plausible principle for causally matching\nveridical and hallucinatory experiences. This way of motivating (CKA) appeals to a same-cause, same effect\nprinciple. That is, \nCausal Principle 1: an event e1 is of the same\nkind as an event e2 if event e1 is produced by the\nsame kind of proximate causal condition as e2 (Nudds 2009:\n336). \nBut the naive realist should reject this principle. As Martin says The naive realist may well admit the possibility of veridical\nexperiences and causally matching hallucinations, but they will resist\nthe idea that sameness of cause implies sameness of the kind of\nexperience involved. This is because there are non-causal\nconditions constitutive conditions for the occurrence of the\nveridical experience which are not satisfied in the hallucinatory\ncase.  However, as Martin goes on to argue, this defence of (CKA)\ndoesn’t mean that the naive realist is in the clear. For the\narguer from hallucination can adopt a different strategy by adopting a\nmodified causal principle: \nCausal Principle 2: an event e1 is of the same\nkind K as an event e2 if event e1 is\nproduced by the same kind of proximate causal condition as e2\nin circumstances that do not differ in any non-causal conditions\nnecessary for the occurrence of an event of kind K (Nudds\n2009: 337). \n(Martin’s own modified causal principle is more complicated than\nthis in allowing for indeterministic causation. We gloss over this\nimportant complication here). Now the arguer from hallucination is\ntaking a different approach by appealing to Causal Principle 2 because\nthis will not allow the arguer to support (CKA). Take\nN to be the fundamental kind which characterizes a veridical\nexperience of a snow covered churchyard. Does Causal Principle 2 allow\nus to say that N is present in the causally matching\nhallucinatory case, as (CKA) predicts? No. For the hallucination is\nproduced in circumstances that differ in non-causal conditions\nnecessary for the occurrence of N given how the naive\nrealist understands N: in the circumstances in which the\nhallucination comes about there is no appropriate object of\nperception and that is necessary for the occurrence of N. So how does Causal Principle 2 help the arguer from hallucination?\nWe have to run an argument from hallucination in “the reverse\ndirection, from what must be true of cases of causally matching\nhallucinations, to what must thereby be true of the veridical\nperceptions they match” (Martin 2006: 368). That is, take a\nhallucination as of a snow covered churchyard h, and suppose\nthat h is of some fundamental kind H. Now we can\napply Causal Principle 2 to show that H is present in a\ncausally matching veridical experience of a snow covered\nchurchyard, v For now v is produced by the same\nkind of proximal cause in circumstances where there is no difference\nin the non-causal conditions necessary for the occurrence of an event\nof kind H. This is because all that is necessary for an\noccurrence of H is some brain condition, which is\npresent in the circumstances in which v is brought\nabout. This reverse causal argument does not show that v\nis not of fundamental kind N. What it does show,\nhowever, is that whatever fundamental kind is present in a causally\nmatching hallucinatory case will also be present in a\nveridical case. So even if v is fundamentally N it\nis also H. That is, we have the Reverse Common Kind\nAssumption: \n(RCKA) Whatever fundamental kind of event occurs when one\nhallucinates, the very same kind of event also occurs in a causally\nmatching veridical experience.  But now we run into the screening off problem for naive\nrealism (Martin 2004). There is something it is like for S to\nhave an hallucinatory experience as of a snow covered churchyard, and\nthe experience seems to relate the subject to a snow covered\nchurchyard. This fact about the hallucinatory experience is grounded\nin its being of kind H. But now if an experience of that kind\nis present in the veridical case, it is difficult to see how what the\nnaive realist says is fundamental to that case, N, is doing\nanything by way of explaining what it is like for a subject to have\nthe experience (Level 2). Consequently the presence of H in\nthe veridical case seems to make N explanatorily\nredundant. That the veridical experience is H seems to screen\noff its being N as what explains its phenomenal\ncharacter.  This is not the end of the road for naive realism, and the way to\nrespond to this problem divides naive realists. The most prominent\nview is the view of Martin (2004, 2006, 2013). On this view the\ndisjunctivist should conceive of H in a purely negative\nepistemic way. That is, what makes it the case that one’s\nhallucinatory experience is as of a snow covered churchyard, with a\ncertain sort of phenomenal character, is just that it is an occurrence\nwhich is indiscriminable from—cannot be told apart,\nintrospectively, from—a veridical perception of a snow covered\nchurchyard. The particular subjective perspective that a hallucinator\nhas in a causally matching hallucination as of a snow covered\nchurchyard is explained just by the obtaining of this negative\nepistemic condition. (Thus, arguably, Dancy’s (1995: 425) demand\nof the disjunctivist for a positive characterization of hallucination\nis misplaced, but see Hellie (2013)).   If this is all there is to the nature of H we can see how\nit can be present in both the hallucinatory and the veridical case:\nsince trivially a veridical experience of a snow covered churchyard is\nindiscriminable from a veridical experience of a snow covered\nchurchyard. But, crucially, the naive realist can deal with the\nscreening off problem. Does H have a nature which means that\nthe presence of H in the veridical case threatens the\nexplanatory power of N? Plausibly not, for it seems that\nH’s explanatory force is parasitic on that of\nN. As Martin notes with his own example: This, in broad outline, is Martin’s approach and one of the\nkey ways in which disjunctivism is developed out of naive\nrealism. With it, we can see how the idea that subjectively\nindistinguishable hallucinations satisfy Openness. They are,\nin their very character, as of ordinary objects which appear\nto one as there or present. It’s just that\nwhat grounds or explains this character is a negative epistemic\nfact. Further discussion and development of Martin’s approach is to\nbe found in Nudds (2009, 2013). For naive realists who have different\nreactions to the screening off problem and thus develop disjunctivism\nin a different way see Fish (2009), Logue (2012a), and Hellie\n(2013). For criticism of Martin’s approach see Hawthorne and\nKovakovich (2006), Farkas (2006), Sturgeon (2008), Siegel (2004,\n2008), and Robinson (2013). See Burge (2005) for a general and\npolemical attack on disjunctivism. For more on disjunctivism, see\nHaddock and Macpherson (eds.) (2008), Byrne and Logue (eds.) (2009),\nMacpherson and Platchias (eds.) (2013) and the entry on\n the disjunctive theory of perception.   The Problem of Perception has given rise to a significant ongoing\ndebate in the philosophy of perception: the debate between\nintentionalists on the one hand, and naive realists and disjunctivists\non the other. This is the greatest chasm in the philosophy of\nperception (Crane 2006). How is it that perceptual experience is an\nOpenness to the mind-independent world? Is it that some such\nexperiences are themselves in their nature non-representational\nrelations to ordinary objects? Or is it that they are in their\nnature non-relational representations of ordinary\nobjects?","contact.mail":"cranetim@mac.com","contact.domain":"mac.com"},{"date.published":"2005-03-08","date.changed":"2015-12-31","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-problem/","author1":"Tim Crane","author1.info":"http://www.timcrane.com/","author2.info":"https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/humanities/departments/philosophy/people/craig.french","entry":"perception-problem","body.text":" \n\nSense-perception has long been a preoccupation of philosophers. One\npervasive and traditional problem, sometimes called “the Problem\nof Perception”, is created by the phenomena of perceptual\nillusion and hallucination: if these kinds of error are possible, how\ncan perception be what we ordinarily understand it to be, an openness to\nand awareness of the world? The present entry is about how these possibilities of error\nchallenge the intelligibility of the phenomenon of perception, and how\nthe major theories of experience in the last century are best\nunderstood as responses to this challenge.\n\nIn this section we spell out the ordinary conception of perceptual\nexperience. There are two central aspects to this: Openness\n(§1.1) and Awareness\n (§1.2). On our ordinary conception of perceptual experience, perceptual\nexperience is a form of “openness to the world” McDowell\n(1994: 111). We understand this more precisely as follows: \nOpenness: Perceptual experience, in its character,\ninvolves the presentation (as) of ordinary mind-independent objects to a\nsubject, and such objects are experienced as present or\nthere such that the character of experience is immediately\nresponsive to the character of its objects.\n To clarify this, we can break it down into two components:\nMind-Independence (§1.1.1), and\nPresence (§1.1.2). The first component of Openness is, \nMind-Independence: perceptual experience involves the\npresentation (as) of ordinary mind-independent objects.\n On ‘object’: we assume a broad understanding of\n‘object’ to encompass perceptible entities in\nmind-independent reality including material objects, but also features\nand other entities (e.g., events, quantities of\nstuff). Mind-Independence is thus a claim otherwise expressed\nas follows: perceptual experience is a presentation of, or is as of, a\npublic, mind-independent subject-matter. On\n‘ordinary’: Mind-Independence concerns\nfamiliar perceptible things, things that we admit as part of\ncommon sense ontology. As P.F. Strawson argued, reflection on ordinary perceptual\nexperience supports a characterization of it in terms of\nMind-Independence: “mature sensible experience (in\ngeneral) presents itself as, in Kantian phrase, an immediate\nconsciousness of the existence of things outside us” (1979:\n97). Strawson begins his argument by asking how someone would\ntypically respond to a request for a description of their current\nvisual experience. He says that it is natural to give the following\nkind of answer: “I see the red light of the setting sun\nfiltering through the black and thickly clustered branches of the\nelms; I see the dappled deer grazing in groups on the vivid green\ngrass…” (1979: 97). There are two ideas implicit in this\nanswer. One is that the description talks about objects and properties\nwhich are, on the face of it, things distinct from this particular\nexperience. The other is that the description is “rich”,\ndescribing the nature of the experience in terms of concepts like deer\nand elms and the setting sun. The description of the experience is not\nmerely in terms of simple shapes and colours; but in terms of the\nthings we encounter in the “lived world” in all their\ncomplexity. As Heidegger puts it, It may be that descriptions of experience like this involve a\ncommitment to the existence of things outside the experience; but\nsurely it is possible to describe experience without this commitment?\nSo let us suppose that we ask our imagined perceiver to repeat their\ndescription without committing themselves to the existence of things\noutside their experience, but without falsifying how their experience\nseems to them. Strawson claims that the best way for them to respond\nis to say “I had a visual experience such as it would have been\nnatural to describe by saying that I saw…” and then to\nadd the previous description of the trees and the deer etc. We give a\ndescription of our experience in terms of the ordinary objects of our\nworld. And we do this even if we are trying not to commit ourselves to\nthe existence of these objects. Strawson’s claim that perceptual experience strikes us as if\nit satisfies what we’re calling Mind-Independence is\nnot a philosophical theory, one that would (for example) refute\nscepticism, the view that we cannot know anything about the\nmind-independent world (see the entry on\n skepticism). Rather, it should be a starting\npoint for philosophical reflection on experience (1979: 94). This is\nwhy this intuitive datum of consciousness is not supposed to rule out\nidealism, the view that the objects and properties we perceive are in\nfact mind-dependent (see the entry on\n idealism). The idealist need not disagree with\nStrawson that reflection on ordinary experience supports\nMind-Independence. They will just hold that, for\nphilosophical reasons, this is not how experience really\nis. Mind-Independence, they can say, is intuitively appealing\nbut ultimately false as a characterization of experience and its\nobjects. The second component of Openness itself involves two\ncomponents. First, the phenomenal character of an experience has\nsomething to do with its presented objects: experience is, in its\ncharacter, a presentation of, or as of, ordinary objects; and\nsecond the character of perceptual experience involves the\npresentation of ordinary objects as\npresent or there in that it is immediately\nresponsive to the character of its objects. \nPresence: the character of perceptual experience itself\ninvolves the presentation (as) of ordinary objects in such a way that\nit is immediately responsive to the character of its presented\nobjects.\n When we reflect upon how the phenomenal character of experience is,\nand try to “turn inwards” to describe the nature of the\nexperience itself, the best way to do this is to describe the objects\nof experience and how they seem to us. It seems a simple matter to\nmove to the further claim that the way these objects actually are is\npart of what determines the phenomenal character of an experience. But this is to move too fast. For what can be said here about\nexperience can also be said about belief: it is widely accepted that\nif I want to reflect upon the nature of my beliefs, the best way to do\nthis is to describe the object or content of my belief: that is, what\nit is in the world that my belief is about. The things my beliefs are\nabout can be as ‘objective’ as the things I perceive. So\nwhat is distinctive of the dependence of perceptual experience on its\nobjects? One answer is that when an object is perceptually experienced, it\nis experienced as “there”, “given” or\n“present to the mind” in a way in which it is not in\nbelief, thought and many other mental states and events. Experience\nseems to involve a particular kind of “presence to the\nmind”. This “presence” goes beyond the mere fact\nthat the objects of experience must exist in order for the experience\nto be veridical. For the objects of knowledge must exist too, but\nstates of knowledge do not, as such, have presence in the same way as\nperceptual experiences—except, of course, in the case when one\nknows something is there by perceiving it. (Compare here the\nphenomenon Scott Sturgeon calls “scene immediacy” (2000:\nChapter 1)). So what is this perceptual presence? Compare perceptual experience\nwith pure thought. Pure thought, like experience, goes straight out to\nthe world itself. But a difference between them is that in the case of\nthought, how the object of thought is at the moment one is thinking of\nit does not in any way constrain one’s thinking of it; but in the case\nof perception it does. One’s perception of a snow covered\nchurchyard is immediately responsive to how the churchyard is now, as\none is perceiving it. But one’s (non-perceptual) thought need\nnot be: in the middle of winter, one can imagine the churchyard as it\nis in spring, covered in autumn leaves, and one can think of it in all\nsorts of ways which are not the ways it presently is. This is not\navailable in perception, because perception can only confront what is\npresently given: in this sense, it seems that you can only see or hear\nor touch what is there. It is because of this that perception is\nsometimes said to have an immediacy or vividness which thought lacks:\nthis vividness derives from the fact that perceived objects and their\nproperties are actually given to the perceiver when being perceived,\nand determine the nature of the character of the experience. Openness is the combination of Mind-Independence,\nand Presence. It is most clearly understood when it applies\nto those perceptual experiences involved in genuine perception (e.g.,\nwhen one sees a snow covered churchyard for what it is). But we\nunderstand Openness as applying more broadly to even\nperceptual experiences which don’t involve perceptual contact\nwith the world. This is why we have formulated it in terms of the\npresentation ‘(as) of’ ordinary objects. For instance,\ntake pure hallucinations of the sort we will consider in \n§2.2 below. Suppose one has an hallucination of a\nsnow covered churchyard for what it is, even when there is no such\nchurchyard there to be perceived. Here, Mind-Independence\ncharacterizes one’s experience. For one’s experience is\nstill as of a public mind-independent scene: the\napparent objects of such hallucinatory experiences are\nordinary objects. And, in a sense, Presence holds. The\nhallucination is, in its character as of the snow covered\nchurchyard, and the churchyard seems to be there, present to\none, such that the character of the experience is constrained by that\napparent scene. Some recent writers on perception have defended a thesis which has\nbecome known as the transparency of experience (see Harman (1990);\nSpeaks (2009); Tye (1992, 1995, 2000); Thau (2002); and for critical\ndiscussions of this idea, Martin (2002), Smith (2008), Stoljar (2004)\nand Soteriou (2013)). Transparency is normally defined as the\nthesis that reflection on, or introspection of, what it is like to\nhave an experience does not reveal that we are aware of experiences\nthemselves, but only of their mind-independent objects. There are two\nclaims here: (i) introspection reveals the mind-independent objects of\nexperience, and (ii) introspection does not reveal non-presentational\nfeatures of experience (that is, features of the character of\nexperience not traceable merely to the appearance of some object or\nfeature in the environment). Transparency is similar to Openness. The latter\nclaim does involve something like (i). But Transparency is\nnot the same as Openness, for it is not obvious that (ii) is\npart of our intuitive conception of experience. We do not have to hold\nthat the phenomenal character of experience is exhausted (or\ncompletely determined) by the nature of the objects and qualities\nwhich are presented in experience. This claim can be disputed. For\nexample, a scene can look very different when one removes one’s\nglasses: one’s visual experience of the churchyard then becomes\nhazy and blurred. But it can be argued that this phenomenal difference\nin experience need not derive from any apparent or represented\ndifference in the objects of experience. Rather, it seems to be a\ndifference in the way in which those objects are experienced\n(although see Tye (2000) for a different understanding of this\nphenomenon). So there are reasons for thinking that (ii) is not part\nof the common sense conception of experience. (For further discussion\non seeing blurrily see Smith (2008), Allen (2013), and French\n(2014). For a different challenge to (ii) see Richardson (2010) and\nSoteriou (2013: Chapter 5)). Openness can characterize perceptual experience which\ndoesn’t involve genuine perceptual contact with the world. But\nit is part of our ordinary way of thinking about perceptual experience\nthat we sometimes make perceptual contact with the world. Thus, we\ncome to the second component of our ordinary conception of perceptual\nexperience: \nAwareness: perceptual experience sometimes gives\nus perceptual awareness of ordinary mind-independent\nobjects. \nFor instance, in seeing a snow covered churchyard for what it is, one\nhas a visual experience, and is visually aware of a snow covered\nchurchyard. (Here we understand perception as a conscious\nstate or event—as something which is or involves perceptual\nexperience—which is a mode of awareness). The Problem of Perception is that if illusions and\nhallucinations are possible, then perception, as we ordinarily\nunderstand it, is impossible. The Problem is animated by two\ncentral arguments: the argument from illusion\n (§2.1) and the argument from hallucination\n(§2.2). (A similar problem has also\nbeen raised with reference to other perceptual phenomena such\nas perspectival variation or conflicting appearances, on which\nsee Burnyeat (1979) and the entry on\n sense-data). For some classic\nreadings on these arguments, see Moore (1905, 1910); Russell\n(1912); Price (1932); Broad (1965); and Ayer (1940), see\nSwartz (1965) for a good collection of readings. And for some\nfairly recent expositions see Snowdon (1992), Robinson (1994:\nChapter 2); Smith (2002: Chapters 1 and 7), and Martin\n(2006). In this section we present the arguments from illusion and\nhallucination both as challenging Awareness. That’s bad\nenough for our intuitive conception of perceptual experience, but it\ngets worse: for later we’ll see how the arguments can be\nsupplemented so as they support the rejection of Openness too\n(§3.1). According to Awareness, we are sometimes perceptually\naware of ordinary mind-independent objects in perceptual\nexperience. Such awareness can come from veridical\nexperiences—cases in which one perceives an object for what it\nis. But it can also come from illusory experiences. For we think of an\nillusion as “any perceptual situation in which a physical object\nis actually perceived, but in which that object perceptually appears\nother than it really is” Smith (2002: 23). For example, a white\nwall seen in yellow light can look yellow to one. (In such cases it is\nnot necessary that one is deceived into believing that things are\nother than they are). The argument from illusion, in a radical form,\naims to show that we are never perceptually aware of ordinary\nobjects. Many things have been called “the argument from\nillusion”. But the basic idea goes as follows: Four immediate comments on this are in order: First, as it stands\nthis is an inadequate representation of the argument as it conceals\nthe complex moves usually invoked by proponents and expositors, but\nwe’ll try to improve on this soon (in particular, a fuller\nversion includes a mini argument for (A)). Second, it is useful to\nrepresent the argument in this basic form to begin with as it enables\nus to highlight its two major movements; what Paul Snowdon calls the\nbase case, and the spreading step (Snowdon 1992). In the base case a\nconclusion about just illusory experiences is sought: namely, (A). In\nthe spreading step, (B), this result is generalized so as to get\nconclusion (C). Third, as we’re representing the argument here\nit is purely negative. But many philosophers have moved from this to\nthe further conclusion that since we are always aware of something in\nperceptual experience, what we are aware of is a\n“non-ordinary” object (sometimes called a\n“sense-datum”). In §3.1, we will\nexamine this further development. Finally, this argument is\nradical in that it concludes that we are never perceptually\naware of ordinary objects. A less radical version concludes instead\nthat we are never directly aware of ordinary objects, but for\nall that we may be indirectly aware of them. We’ll\nreturn briefly to this less radical version of the argument in\n §3.1 below. For now we’ll set aside\ncomplications to do with direct and indirect awareness.  Moving beyond the simple formulation, the argument from illusion\nis typically presented as involving these steps: This improves on the simple version of the argument in having both\na fuller base case stage and a fuller spreading step. That is, the\nbasis of premise (A) is made clear, and the spreading from (B) is\nexpanded. The most controversial premise in the argument is premise (ii). The\nother premises just reflect intuitive ways of thinking about\nperceptual experience, and so are unlikely to be targeted by one\nseeking to reject the argument from illusion. This is clear enough\nwith premises (i) and (vi), but what about premise (iv)? What this\nmeans is that the account of the nature and objects of illusory and\nveridical experiences must be the same. Though it may be disputed,\nthis premise seems plausible. For veridical and illusory experiences\nboth seem to be cases where one is aware of an ordinary object. The\nonly difference is that in the illusory case, but not in the veridical\ncase, the object one is aware of appears some way other than it in\nfact is.   Premise (ii) is what Howard Robinson has usefully labelled the\n“Phenomenal Principle”: C.D. Broad motivates this principle on\nexplanatory grounds. In cases of perceptual experience things appear\nsome ways rather than others to us. We need to explain this. Why does\nthe penny one sees look elliptical to one as opposed to some other\nshape? One answer is that there is something of which one is aware\nwhich is in fact elliptical. Thus as Broad says “If, in fact,\nnothing elliptical is before my mind, it is very hard to understand\nwhy the penny should seem elliptical rather than of any other\nshape.” (1923: 240). Other philosophers have simply taken the\nprinciple to be obvious. H.H. Price, for example, says that\n“When I say ‘this table appears brown to me’ it is\nquite plain that I am acquainted with an actual instance of\nbrownness” (Price 1932: 63).  So much for the argument’s main premises. How is it supposed\nto work? Here we find the suggestion that it hinges on an application\nof Leibniz’s Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals (Robinson\n(1994: 32); Smith (2002: 25)). The point is that (i) and (ii) tell us\nthat in an illusory experience one is aware of an F thing,\nbut the ordinary object supposedly being perceived is not F,\nthus the F thing one is aware of and the ordinary object are\nnot identical, by Leibniz’s Law. On these grounds, the\nconclusion of the base case stage is supposed to follow. And then the\nultimate conclusion of the argument can be derived from its further\npremises.  But as French and Walters (forthcoming) argue,\nthis is invalid. (i), (ii) and Leibniz’s Law entail that in an\nillusory experience one is directly aware of an F thing which\nis non-identical to the ordinary object supposedly being\nperceived. But this doesn’t entail that in the illusion one is\nnot directly aware of the ordinary object. One might be aware of the\nordinary object as well as the F thing one is aware\nof. We should be careful to distinguish not being (directly) aware of\nthe wall from being (directly) aware of something which is not the\nwall. The argument is invalid in conflating these two ideas. One option for fixing the argument is to introduce what French and\nWalters call the Exclusion Assumption (cf., Snowdon (1992: 74)):  This assumption bridges the gap between the conclusion actually\nachieved: \n(iii*) in an illusory experience one is aware of an F\nthing non-identical to the ordinary object  and the desired conclusion (iii). But whether this assumption is\ndefensible remains to be seen. In the remainder we leave this and the\nissue of validity aside and consider responses from different theories\nof experience. A hallucination is an experience which seems exactly like a\nveridical perception of an ordinary object but where there is no such\nobject there to be perceived. Like illusions, hallucinations in this\nsense do not necessarily involve deception. And nor need they be like\nthe real hallucinations suffered by the mentally ill, drug-users or\nalcoholics. They are rather supposed to be merely possible events:\nexperiences which are indistinguishable for the subject from a genuine\nperception of an object. For example, suppose one is now having a\nveridical perception of a snow covered churchyard. The assumption that\nhallucinations are possible means that one could have an experience\nwhich is subjectively indistinguishable—that is,\nindistinguishable by the subject, “from the\ninside”—from a veridical perception of a snow covered\nchurchyard, but where there is in fact no churchyard there to be\nperceived. (For more on hallucination, see the essays collected in\nMacpherson and Platchias (2013)). A radical form of the argument again challenges\nAwareness: What this argument shows, if it is successful, is that one is not\nperceptually aware of ordinary objects in veridical experiences. The\nconclusion here is not as general as the conclusion of the argument\nfrom illusion, but the more general conclusion is surely not far off:\nfor it would be difficult to maintain that though one is not\nperceptually aware of ordinary objects in veridical experiences, there\nare other cases of experience where one is perceptually aware of\nordinary objects. So this argument supports if not\nentails the rejection of our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience. Its aim is to show that an aspect of our\nordinary conception of perception is deeply problematic, if not\nincoherent: perceptual experience cannot be what we intuitively think\nit is. (It is essentially this problem which Valberg (1992) calls\n“the puzzle of experience”.) But as with the argument from\nillusion, the argument can be developed, in supplemented form, to\ndefend the conclusion that we only ever perceptually aware of\n“non-ordinary” objects (see\n §3.1).  Once again we can view the argument as having a base case (A) and\na spreading step (B) (Snowdon 2005). Unlike with the argument from\nillusion, the base case here is less controversial: it doesn’t\nrely on the Phenomenal Principle. We thus don’t need a more\ncomplicated argument to support it. (A) simply falls out of what\nhallucinations are supposed to be, and two principles: first, that\nawareness of an object is a relation to an object, and second, that\nrelations entail the existence of their relata. For given our\nprinciples, if an hallucination as of an ordinary object is to be a\nmode of awareness of an ordinary object then there must be an ordinary\nobject there for one to perceive. But no such objects are there in\nhallucinations, therefore, hallucinations are not cases of awareness\nof ordinary objects. Where the argument from hallucination is controversial is in the\nspreading step. The spreading step here gets construed in terms of the\nidea that veridical experiences and hallucinations are essentially the\nsame; mental events of the same fundamental kind (Martin\n(2006)). (This doesn’t mean that we lose a distinction between\nveridical experiences and hallucinations. It just means that the\ndifference between veridical experience and hallucination is not to be\nfound in their intrinsic natures). This claim seems plausible, as from\na subject’s perspective an hallucination cannot be told apart\nfrom a veridical experience. Thus some will accept (B) and thus deny\nthat we are ever perceptually aware of ordinary objects (see\nsense-datum theories §3.1), and others will\naccept (B) but argue that we can still have perceptual awareness of\nordinary objects (see intentionalist theories\n §3.3). But as we’ll see, others will want\nto secure perceptual awareness of ordinary objects by rejecting (B)\nand holding that hallucinations and veridical experiences are\nfundamentally different (see naive realist theories and disjunctivism\n§3.4).  Though it is not plausible to deny the possibility of illusory\nexperiences (though we may argue about how best to construe them;\nAnthony (2011) and Kalderon (2011)), the claim that subjectively\nindistinguishable hallucinations are possible is a little more\ncontroversial. How do we really know that experiences like this are\npossible? (Austin (1962), for instance, expresses scepticism). One way\nto answer this—though certainly not the only way—is to\nappeal to a broad and uncontroversial empirical fact about experience:\nthat it is the upshot or outcome of a causal process linking the\norgans of perception with the environment, that our experiences are\nthe effects of things going on inside and outside our bodies. If this\nis so, then we can understand why hallucinations are a\npossibility. For any causal chain reaching from a cause C1\nto effect E, there are intermediate causes C2,\nC3 etc., such that E could have been brought about even if\nC1 had not been there but one of the later causes (see the\nentry on\n the metaphysics of causation). \nIf this is true of causal processes in general, and\nperceptual experience is the product of a causal process, then we can\nsee how it is possible that I could have an experience of the\nchurchyard which was brought about by causes “downstream”\nof the actual cause (the churchyard). (This plays into the causal\nargument discussed in §3.4).  In this section we will consider the leading theories of experience\nof the last hundred years. These theories are understood here as\nresponses to the Problem of Perception. (There are a number of\ntheories of perception which are not discussed in this entry, either\nbecause they are not responses to this specific problem (like the\ncausal theory of Grice (1961) and Lewis (1988), and Burge (2010)) or\nbecause they require an entire entry of their own (like the\nphenomenology of Husserl (1900–1) and Merleau-Ponty (1945); see\nthe entry on phenomenology)).\n  As we understand theories of experience, they operate on two\nlevels. On one level they tell us about the nature or structure of\nexperience, on another level they tell us how what is said at the\nfirst level bears on grounding or explaining the phenomenal character\nof experience. Crudely, and with details and qualifications to\nexplored below: The Sense-Datum Theory: Level 1: experience is\nfundamentally a relation to a non-ordinary object; a\nsense-datum. Level 2: the character of experience is explained by\nthe real presence of sense-data and their qualities in experience\n(§3.1). The Adverbial Theory: Level 1: experience is\nnon-relational and fundamentally a state of mind adverbially\nmodified in a certain way (e.g., visually sensing brownly). Level 2:\nthe character of experience is explained by the intrinsic qualities\nof experience which constitute the ways in which it is modified\n (§3.2). The Intentionalist Theory: Level 1: experience is\nnon-relational and fundamentally a matter of representing ordinary\nobjects in certain ways. Level 2: the character of experience is\nexplained by its representational nature\n (§3.3). The Naive Realist Theory: Level 1: experience is\nfundamentally a relation to ordinary aspects of mind-independent\nreality. Level 2: the character of experience is explained by the\nreal presence of ordinary aspects of mind-independent reality in\nexperience (§3.4).  (In this exposition we do not consider much the possibility of\nmixed or hybrid views). \nHere is what we find: The sense-datum theorist rejects our ordinary\nconception of perceptual experience. The adverbial theorist tries to\nimprove upon the sense-datum theory, and holds on to\nAwareness. But it is unclear how they can secure\nOpenness. Intentionalists and naive realists hold to both\nOpenness and Awareness, but they do so in different\nways, and with different responses to the Problem of Perception. (The\nway these positions emerge in response to the Problem of Perception is\nmapped most clearly in Martin (1995, 1998, 2000)).\n On the sense-datum theory, a perceptual experience in which\nsomething appears F to one consists in a relation of\nperceptual awareness to something which is actually F (Level\n1). So whenever a subject has a sensory experience, there is something\nof which they are perceptually aware. This relational conception of\nexperience is sometimes called an “act-object” conception,\nsince it posits a distinction between the mental act of sensing, and\nthe object which is sensed.  A sense-datum theorist calls the object of an experience a\nsense-datum. We can thus re-formulate the Phenomenal Principle\nespoused by the sense-datum theorists in these terms: \nIf there sensibly appears to a subject to be something\nwhich possesses a particular sensible quality F then there is\nsomething—a sense-datum—of which the subject is directly\naware which does possess that sensible quality.  \nFor the sense-datum theorist, the character of an experience is\nsomehow explained (at least in part) by the sensible qualities of the\nsense-datum one is aware of. (Level 2). Consider an experience which\none would describe in terms of seeing a snow covered churchyard for\nwhat it is. We can isolate certain aspects of the phenomenal character\nof such an experience, such as the appearance of whiteness to one. We\nwant a theory of experience to explain such aspects. The sense-datum\ntheorist will claim that things appearing white to you consists in\nyour perceptual awareness of a white sense-datum. The character of\nyour experience is explained by an actual instance of whiteness\nmanifesting itself in experience. Now ultimately the sense-datum theory opposes our\nordinary conception of experience, but it doesn’t as\nwe have it so far. For at the moment we have no\nopposition between sense-data and ordinary objects. Suppose\nthat one has an experience of a churchyard as described above,\nand so one is perceptually aware of a white sense-datum. Now\nsuppose one’s experience is veridical. Well, for all\nwe’ve said, the sense-datum one is aware of could be an\nordinary bit of mind-independent reality: some white\nsnow. This is not ruled out, for a sense-datum is just\nwhatever it is that one is aware of in a perceptual\nexperience which instantiates the sensible qualities which\ncharacterize the phenomenology of one’s experience. All\nwe know about sense-data is that they must satisfy two\nconditions:  But paradigm sense-datum theories are, in contrast,\nnon-minimal. And such non-minimal sense-datum theorists do\nreject our ordinary conception of perceptual experience. We can make\nsense of this if we move to a less minimal conception of sense-data\nthemselves, on which they are not ordinary aspects of mind-independent\nreality. One option here is to articulate a theory of sense-experience\nand sense-data independently of the problem of perception (Jackson\n(1977) and Lowe (1992)). But by far the most popular approach for\nsense-datum theorists has been to move to a more committed conception\nof sense-data on the basis of arguments like the argument from\nillusion and the argument from hallucination. How does this work?  Take first the argument from illusion. Suppose one sees a white\nwall as yellow. The sense-datum theorist accepts the base case of the\nargument, along with Leibniz’s Law, and so holds that in the\nillusion one is aware of a yellow sense-datum which is not the\nwall. And suppose the illusion occurs in a world devoid of\nordinary objects which are in fact yellow. Thus the\nsense-datum is a non-ordinary object. Suppose we accept\nfurther that in illusions we are directly aware of such non-ordinary\nsense-data instead of and not as well as the relevant\nordinary objects. So illusions are cases where one is directly aware\nof just a non-ordinary sense-datum. With this the sense-datum\ntheorist accepts the spreading step and concludes that no perceptual\nexperience is a case of awareness of an ordinary object, and that\nillusory and veridical experiences are cases of awareness of\nnon-ordinary sense-data.   We can run a similar line of thought with the argument from\nhallucination. Suppose one has an hallucinatory experience as of a\nchurchyard covered in white snow. But there is no such churchyard\nthere to be perceived. The sense-datum theorist conceives of this\nexperience as a case of perceptual awareness of a white\nsense-datum. Suppose the hallucination occurs in a world devoid of\nordinary white things, so the sense-datum one is aware of is\na non-ordinary sense-datum. The sense-datum theorist then\nendorses the spreading step stage of argument to get the conclusion\nthat even in veridical experiences one is aware of just non-ordinary\nsense-data.  Initially, the arguments from illusion and hallucination were\npresented as aiming for a negative claim. But what we’ve seen\nhere is that the minimal sense-datum theorist can supplement the\nbase case with further considerations so as to get not just the\nnegative conclusion but a positive conclusion, which is itself\ngeneralised in the spreading step stage. That is, in combination:  The arguments, understood as such, are not arguments for the\nminimal sense-datum theory—the arguments presuppose\nsuch a theory. Rather, they serve as arguments for the transition from\nthe minimal form of the sense-datum theory to the non-minimal form\nwhich invokes non-ordinary sense-data.  From now on when we speak of “sense-data” we will mean\nnon-ordinary sense-data. Sense-datum theorists will divide over\nexactly how to understand sense-data insofar as they are\nnon-ordinary. The early sense-datum theorists (like Moore\n(1914)) considered sense-data to be mind-independent, but non-physical\nobjects. Later theories treat sense-data as mind-dependent entities\n(Robinson (1994)), and this is how the theory is normally understood\nin the second half of the twentieth century. What these different\nworkings out of the theory have in common, though, is that they stand\nopposed to our ordinary conception of perceptual experience in both\nits aspects. On the non-minimal sense-datum theory, perceptual\nexperiences are presentations not of ordinary objects, but of\nsense-data, and the character of experience, though dependent on its\nobjects, is thus dependent upon non-ordinary objects. Thus\nOpenness is false. The sense-datum theorist need not deny\nthat we are presented with objects as if they are ordinary\nobjects. But they will insist that this is an error. (So sense-datum\ntheories are not simply refuted (as Harman 1990 seems to argue) by\npointing to the phenomenological fact that the objects of experience\nseem to be the ordinary things around us). And in perceptual\nexperience we are not aware of ordinary objects but non-ordinary\nsense-data. Thus Awareness is false. Must a non-minimal sense-datum theorist deny Awareness? It\nseems not. Some sense-datum theorists introduce a distinction between\ndirect and indirect awareness. With this, they don’t deny that\nwe are ever perceptually aware of ordinary objects, only that we are\never directly perceptually aware of ordinary objects. The\nsense-datum theorist can say that we are indirectly aware of\nordinary objects: that is, aware of them by (in virtue of) being aware\nof sense-data. A sense-datum theorist who says this is known as an\nindirect realist or representative realist, or as someone who holds a\nrepresentative theory of perception (see Jackson (1977), Lowe (1992);\nsee also the entry on\n epistemological problems of perception).\n A theorist who denies that we are aware of\nmind-independent objects at all, directly or indirectly, but only of\nsense-data construed as mental entities, is known as a phenomenalist\nor an idealist about perception (see Foster (2000) for a recent\ndefence, see Crane and Farkas (2004: Section 2) for an introduction to\nthe subject; and the entry on\n idealism).  On the face of it the indirect realist form of the sense-datum\ntheory salvages something of our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience, but securing Awareness. But this\nshouldn’t be at all satisfying to one who wants to defend our\nintuitive conception of perceptual experience, for two reasons. First,\nOpenness is still being denied. Second, once we are given the\ndistinction between direct and indirect perception, a defender of our\nordinary conception of perceptual experience is likely to uphold\nAwareness in a more specific form, that is, as the idea that\nperceptual experience sometimes gives us direct awareness of\nordinary objects. That is, the main theories of experience which\nuphold our ordinary conception of perceptual\nexperience—intentionalism and naive realism—are both\nusually regarded as versions of direct realism.  The sense-datum theory was widely rejected in the second half of\nthe 20th century, though it still had its occasional\nchampions in this period (e.g., Jackson (1977), O’Shaughnessy\n(1980, 2000, 2003), Lowe (1992), Robinson (1994), Foster (2000)). A\nnumber of objections have been made to the theory. Some of these\nobjections are objections specifically to the indirect realist version\nof the sense-datum theory: for example, the claim that the theory\ngives rise to an unacceptable “veil of perception” between\nthe mind and the world. The idea is that the sense-data\n“interpose” themselves between perceivers and the\nmind-independent objects which we normally take ourselves to be\nperceiving, and therefore leaves our perceptual, cognitive and\nepistemic access to the world deeply problematic if not impossible. In\nresponse to this, the indirect realist can say that sense-data are the\nmedium by which we perceive the mind-independent world, and no more\ncreate a “veil of perception” than the fact that we use\nwords to talk about things creates a “veil of words”\nbetween us and the things we talk about. (For recent discussion see\nSilins (2011)). A common objection in contemporary philosophy is to attack the\nPhenomenal Principle (see Barnes (1944–5); Anscombe (1965)). The\nobjection is that the Phenomenal Principle is fallacious. It is not\nbuilt into the meaning of “something appears F to\none” that “one is aware of an F\nthing”. Defenders of the sense-datum theory can respond that the\nPhenomenal Principle is not supposed to be a purely logical inference;\nit is not supposed to be true simply because of the logical form or\nsemantic structure of “appears” and similar\nlocutions. Rather, it is true because of specific phenomenological\nfacts about perceptual experience. But this just means that theorists\nwho reject the Phenomenal Principle are not disagreeing about whether\nthe Phenomenal Principle involves a fallacy or about some semantic\nissue, but rather about the nature of experience itself.  Another influential objection to sense-data comes from the\nprevailing naturalism of contemporary philosophy. Naturalism (or\nphysicalism) says that the world is entirely physical in its nature:\neverything there is supervenes on the physical, and is governed by\nphysical law. Many sense-datum theorists are committed to the claim\nthat non-ordinary sense-data are mind-dependent: objects\nwhose existence depends on the existence of states of mind. Is this\nconsistent with naturalism? If so, the challenge is to explain how an\nobject can be brought into existence by the existence of an\nexperience, and how this is supposed to be governed by physical\nlaw. Many contemporary sense-datum theorists, however, will not be moved\nby this challenge, since they are happy to accept the rejection of\nnaturalism as a consequence of their sense-data theory (see Robinson\n1994, Foster 2000). On the other hand, one might think that there is\nno conflict here with naturalism, as long as experiences themselves\nare part of the natural order. But if sense-data are non-ordinary in\nbeing mind-independent but non-physical, then it is much less\nclear how naturalism can be maintained (cf., what Martin (2004, 2006)\ncalls “experiential naturalism” which serves as a\nconstraint on theories of experience and rules out some but not all\nforms of the sense-datum theory).  Some philosophers agree with the Phenomenal Principle that\nwhenever a sensory quality appears to be instantiated then it is\ninstantiated, but deny that this entails the existence of\nsense-data. Rather, they hold that we should think of these qualities\nas modifications of the experience itself (Level 1). Hence when\nsomeone has an experience of something brown, something like brownness\nis instantiated, but in the experience itself, not an object. This is\nnot to say that the experience is brown, but rather that the\nexperience is modified in a certain way, the way we can call\n“perceiving brownly”. The canonical descriptions of\nperceptual experiences, then, employ adverbial modifications of the\nperceptual verbs: instead of describing an experience as\nsomeone’s “visually sensing a brown square”, the\ntheory says that they are “visually sensing brownly and\nsquarely”. This is why this theory is called the\n“adverbial theory”; but it is important to emphasise that\nit is more a theory about the phenomenal character of experience\nitself (Level 2) than it is a semantic analysis of sentences\ndescribing experience.  Part of the point of the adverbial theory, as defended by Ducasse\n(1942) and Chisholm (1957) was to do justice to the phenomenology of\nexperience whilst avoiding the dubious metaphysical commitments the\nsense-datum theorists take on in responding to the Problem of\nPerception. The only entities which the adverbialist needs to\nacknowledge are subjects of experience, experiences themselves, and\nways these experiences are modified. This makes the theory appear less\ncontroversial than the sense-datum theory. When used in a broad way, “qualia” picks out whatever\nqualities a state of mind has which constitute the state of\nmind’s having the phenomenal character it has. In this broad\nsense, any conscious state of mind has qualia. (This is the way the\nterm is used in, e.g., Chalmers (1996)) Used in a narrow way, however,\nqualia are non-intentional, intrinsic properties of experience:\nproperties which have no intentional or representational aspects\nwhatsoever. To use Gilbert Harman’s apt metaphor, qualia in this\nsense are “mental paint” properties (1990). Harman rejects\nmental paint, the idea of experience as involving mental paint is\ntaken up and defended by Block (2004)).  It is relatively uncontroversial to say that there are qualia in\nthe broad sense. It can be misleading, however, to use the term in\nthis way, since it can give rise to the illusion that the existence of\nqualia is a substantial philosophical thesis when in fact it is\nsomething which will be accepted by anyone who believes in phenomenal\ncharacter. (Hence Dennett’s (1991) denial of qualia can seem\nbewildering if “qualia” is taken in the broad sense). It\nis controversial to say that there are qualia in the narrow sense,\nthough, and those who have asserted their existence have therefore\nprovided arguments and thought-experiments to defend this assertion\n(see Block (1997), Peacocke (1983 Chapter 1), Shoemaker (1990)). In\nwhat follows, “qualia” will be used exclusively in the\nnarrow sense.  The adverbial theory is committed to the view that experiencing\nsomething red, for example, involves one’s experience being\nmodified in a certain way: experiencing redly. The most natural way to\nunderstand this is that the experience is an event, and the\nmodification of it is a property of that event. Since this property is\nboth intrinsic (as opposed to relational or representational) and\nphenomenal (that is, consciously available) then this way of\nunderstanding the adverbial theory is committed to the existence of\nqualia.  An important objection to the adverbial theory has been proposed\nby Frank Jackson (1975). Consider someone who senses a brown square\nand a green triangle simultaneously. The adverbial theory will\ncharacterise this state of mind as “sensing brownly and squarely\nand greenly and triangularly”. But how can it distinguish the\nstate of mind it is describing in this way from that of sensing a\nbrown triangle and a green square? The characterisation fits that\nstate of mind equally well. Obviously, what is wanted is a description\naccording to which the brownness “goes with” the\nsquareness, and the greenness “goes with” the\ntriangularity. But how is the theory to do this without introducing\nobjects of experience—the things which are brown and green\nrespectively—or a visual field with a spatial structure? The\nchallenge is whether the adverbial theory can properly account for the\nspatial structure and complexity in what is given in visual\nexperience. (See Tye (1984) for an attempt to respond to this\nchallenge.)  A related objection concerns the relationship between the\nadverbial theory and our ordinary conception of experience. The\nadverbial theorist might admit that, in a sense, we are aware\nof ordinary objects. When one “senses redly“ if this state\nof mind is appropriately caused by a red thing (e.g., a tomato),\nperhaps this is what being aware of such an object amounts to. And it\nis not as if such awareness is indirect or mediated by\nsense-data. However, it is not at all clear that the adverbialist is\nin a position to secure Openness. For the adverbialist\nrejects not just the idea that experience has a genuine act-object\nstructure, but the idea that the character of experience is even a\npresentation as of ordinary things and qualities. Qualities\nget into the picture, and are constitutive of phenomenal character,\nbut not by being presented from outside of experience as qualities of\nthings, as Openness would have it. How, then, can the\nadverbialist account even for the appearance of an act-object\nstructure within experience, for Openness? It is unclear how\nthe adverbialist is to answer this question (see Martin (1998); Crane\n(2000)). And so it is unclear how much of an improvement the adverbial\napproach, and the qualia theory, is over the sense-datum theory. At Level 1, the intentional theory of experience treats perceptual\nexperience as a form of intentionality conceived of as a form of\nmental representation (hence it is also sometimes called the\nrepresentationalist theory of\nexperience). “Intentionality” is a term with its origins\nin scholastic philosophy (see Crane 1998b), but its current use\nderives from Brentano (1874), who introduced the term\n“intentional inexistence” for the “mind’s\ndirection upon its objects”. Intentional inexistence, or\nintentionality, is sometimes explained as the “aboutness”\nof mental states (see the entries on\n Franz Brentano,\n representational theories of consciousness\n and\n intentionality). An intentional mental\nstate is normally understood, therefore, as one which is about, or\nrepresents, something in the world. At Level 2, this is put to work in explaining phenomenal\ncharacter. Take an experience as of a churchyard covered in white\nsnow. Why is this a case of things appearing white to one? Here the\nintentionalist appeals to the experience’s representation of\nwhiteness in the environment. It is not generally true that when a\nrepresentation represents something as being F, there has to\nactually be something which is F. Thus for the\nintentionalist, experience is representational in a way that contrasts\nwith it being relational. Experience does not genuinely have an\nact-object structure. This is in keeping with a standard tradition in\nthe theory of intentionality which treats it as non-relational (the\ntradition derives from Husserl 1900/1901; for discussion see Zahavi\n2003: 13–27). So intentionalism contrasts with the sense-datum\ntheory: since it is not of the essence of experience or its character\nthat it is relational, it is not of its essence that it is a relation\nto a non-ordinary sense-datum.  The intentionalist can thus reject the argument from illusion in\nthe form presented in §2.1 and the supplemented\nform presented in §3.1.1. This is because\nthese arguments hinge on the minimal sense-datum theory, or the\nPhenomenal Principle which the intentional theory is an alternative\nto. An illusory experience in which a white wall appears yellow to one\nis thus not conceived of as a case in which one is aware of a yellow\nsense-datum. It is instead conceived of as a case in which a white\nwall is represented as being yellow. As we’ll see, the\nintentionalist can even maintain the intuitive idea that in such\nillusions one is aware of the ordinary objects one seems to be aware\nof—but that’s something we’ll come back to\nshortly.  What about hallucinations? Again the intentionalist can reject the\nsupplemented form of the argument from hallucination from\n §3.1.1 because this version of the argument\nrelies on the Phenomenal Principle. But what about the original form\nof the argument from hallucination? This argument does not rely on the\nPhenomenal Principle, yet its conclusion is that not even veridical\nexperiences give us direct awareness of ordinary mind-independent\nobjects. So how is the intentionalist to deal with this argument? The\nintentionalist accepts (A) but also (B) in a specific form. That is,\nthey accept (B) where that is understood in terms of what Martin\n(2004, 2006) has called the Common Kind Assumption, that is: \n(CKA) Whatever fundamental kind of mental event occurs\nwhen one veridically perceives, the very same kind of event could\noccur were one hallucinating.  \nTake a veridical perception of a white snow covered churchyard for\nwhat it is. The experience involved in this perception, the\nintentionalist thinks, is fundamentally a matter of experientially\nrepresenting the presence of a white snow covered churchyard. And this\nfundamental kind of mental event is exactly what is present in the\nsubjectively indistinguishable hallucinatory case, for such\nhallucinatory experiences have the same representational nature as\ntheir veridical counterparts.  But then doesn’t this mean that the intentionalist is saddled\nwith the conclusion of the argument from hallucination (C)? If so, the\nrejection of Awareness and our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience is not far off. Since if we are not perceptually\naware of ordinary objects in veridical experiences, it is unclear how\nany form of perceptual awareness of ordinary objects can be\nsecured. However, the intentionalist can distinguish between two readings of\nthe conclusion. On the first reading, we have \n(C*) veridical experiences are not fundamentally\ncases of awareness of ordinary objects. This is entailed by the argument as we have construed it. But what\nis not entailed is \n(C**) veridical experiences don’t give us\nperceptual awareness of ordinary objects.  As long as (C**) doesn’t follow, the intentionalist can\nsuggest, Awareness is secure. The intentionalist admits that\nnot even veridical experiences are fundamentally cases of perceptual\nawareness of ordinary objects. Such experiences are fundamentally\nrepresentational in a way that contrasts with them being\nrelational. But that simply doesn’t mean that we can’t\ncome to be perceptually aware, even directly perceptually\naware, of an ordinary object by having a veridical\nexperience. Veridical experiences may be the occasions for such\nawareness even if they are not themselves constituted by instances of\nsuch awareness. They can be occasions for such awareness precisely\nbecause they represent ordinary objects. In their very\ncharacter they are about, directed on, the mind-independent world (in\ncontrast to both sense-datum theories, and adverbialist theories). We\ncome to have (direct) perceptual awareness by having such experiences\nwhen the world also plays its part: when things in the world are as\nthey are represented to be in the experience, and when the world is\nhooked up to the experience in an appropriate way. This also helps us\nto see how even illusions can give us (direct) awareness of ordinary\nobjects. In these cases, experience represents an ordinary object\nwhich is there to be perceived, and it is appropriately related to\none’s experience, yet there is some misrepresentation of the\nobject. Thus the intentionalist can respond to Problem of Perception: it\nhas solutions to both arguments which animate the Problem. And the\nintentionalist response secures both aspects of our ordinary\nconception of perceptual experience. The intentionalist explains how\nexperience satisfies Openness in terms of it having a certain\nsort of representational nature. That is, a perceptual experience\ninvolves, in its very character, the presentation of ordinary\nmind-independent objects to a subject precisely because it is a matter\nof perceptual representation of ordinary aspects of the\nenvironment. And such aspects are represented as there,\npresent. The character of experience is immediately\nresponsive to the character of its objects because it is constituted,\nat least in part, by the way those objects are represented, at the\ntime they are experienced.  Some of the most influential intentional theories are Anscombe\n(1965), Armstrong (1968), Pitcher (1970), Peacocke (1983), Harman\n(1990), Tye (1992, 1995), Dretske (1995), Lycan (1996); for more\nrecent accounts, see Byrne (2001), Siegel (2010), Pautz (2010) and the\nentry on the contents of perception.  Within analytic philosophy, the intentionalist theory of\nperception is a generalisation of an idea presented by G.E.M. Anscombe\n(1965), and the “belief theories” of D.M. Armstrong (1968)\nand George Pitcher (1970). (Within the phenomenological tradition\nintentionality and perception had always been discussed together: see\nthe entry on phenomenology.) Anscombe\nhad drawn attention to the fact that perceptual verbs satisfy the\ntests for non-extensionality or intensionality (see the entry on\n intensional transitive verbs).\n For example, just as ‘Vladimir is thinking about\nPegasus’ is an intensional context, so ‘Vladimir has an\nexperience as of a pink elephant in the room’ is an intensional\ncontext. In neither case can we infer that there exists something\nVladimir is thinking about, or that there is exists something he is\nexperiencing. This is the typical manifestation of\nintensionality. Anscombe regarded the error of sense-data and naive\nrealist theories of perception as the failure to recognise this\nintensionality.  Armstrong and Pitcher argued that perception is a form of\nbelief. (More precisely, they argued that it is the acquisition of a\nbelief, since an acquisition is a conscious event, as perceiving is;\nrather than a state or condition, as belief is.) Belief is an\nintentional state in the sense that it represents the world to be a\ncertain way, and the way it represents the world to be is said to be\nits intentional content. Perception, it was argued, is similarly a\nrepresentation of the world, and the way it represents the world to be\nis likewise its intentional content. The fact that someone can have a\nperceptual experience that a is F without there\nbeing any thing which is F was taken as a reason for saying\nthat perception is just a form of belief-acquisition.  The belief theory of perception (and related theories, like the\njudgement theory of Craig (1976)) is a specific version of the\nintentional theory. But it is not the most widely accepted version\n(though see Glüer (2009) for a recent defence). Everyone will\nagree that perception does give rise to beliefs about the\nenvironment. But this does not mean that perception is simply the\nacquisition of belief. One obvious reason why it isn’t,\ndiscussed by Armstrong, is that one can have a perceptual illusion\nthat things are a certain way even when one knows they are not (this\nphenomenon is sometimes called “the persistence of\nillusion”). The famous Müller-Lyer illusion presents two\nlines of equal length as if they were unequal. One can experience this\neven if one knows (and therefore believes) that the lines are the same\nlength. If perception were simply the acquisition of belief, then this\nwould be a case of explicitly contradictory beliefs: one believes that\nthe lines are the same length and that they are different lengths. But\nthis is surely not the right way to describe this\nsituation. (Armstrong recognised this, and re-described perception as\na “potential belief”; this marks a significant retreat\nfrom the original claim). The intentionalist theory is, however, not\ncommitted to the view that perceptual experience is belief; experience\ncan be a sui generis kind of intentional state or event (see\nMartin 1992–3).  Intentionalists hold that what is in common between perceptions\nand indistinguishable hallucinations is their intentional content:\nroughly speaking, how the world is represented as being by the\nexperiences. Many intentionalists hold that the sameness of phenomenal\ncharacter in perception and hallucination is exhausted or constituted\nby this sameness in content (see Tye (2000), Byrne (2001)). But this\nlatter claim is not essential to intentionalism (see the discussion of\nintentionalism and qualia below). What is essential is that the\nintentional content of perception explains (whether wholly or partly)\nits phenomenal character.  The intentional content of perception is sometimes called\n“perceptual content” (see the entry on\n the contents of perception). What\nis perceptual content? A standard approach to intentionality treats\nall intentional states as propositional attitudes: states which are\nascribed by sentences of the form “S ___ that p” where\n‘S’ is to be replaced by a term for a subject,\n‘p’ with a sentence, and the ‘___’ with a\npsychological verb. The distinguishing feature of the propositional\nattitudes is that their content—how they represent the world to\nbe—is something which is assessable as true or false. Hence the\ncanonical form of ascriptions of perceptual experiences is: “S\nperceives/experiences that p”. Perception, on this kind of\nintentionalist view, is a propositional attitude (see Byrne (2001) for\na recent defence of this idea, see also Siegel (2010)). But intentionalism is not committed to the view that perception is\na propositional attitude. For one thing, it is controversial whether\nall intentional states are propositional attitudes (see Crane (2001:\nChapter 4)). Among the intentional phenomena there are relations like\nlove and hate which do not have propositional content; and there are\nalso non-relational states expressed by the so-called\n“intensional transitive” verbs like seek, fear, expect\n(see the entry on\n intensional transitive verbs).\n All these states of mind have contents which\nare not, on the face of it, assessable as true or false. If I am\nseeking a bottle of inexpensive Burgundy, what I am seeking—the\nintentional content of my seeking, or the intentional object under a\ncertain mode of presentation—is not something true or\nfalse. Some argue that these intentional relations and intentional\ntransitives are analysable or reducible to propositional formulations\n(see Larson (2003) for an attempt to defend this view of intensional\ntransitives; and Sainsbury (2010) for a less radical defence). But the\nmatter is controversial; and it is especially controversial where\nperception is concerned. For we have many ways of talking about\nperception which do not characterise its content in propositional\nterms: for example, “Vladimir sees a snail on the grass”,\nor “Vladimir is watching a snail on the grass” can be\ndistinguished from the propositional formulation “Vladimir sees\nthat there is a snail on the grass” (for an interesting recent\ndiscussion of watching, see Crowther 2009). There are those who follow\nDretske (1969) in claiming that these semantical distinctions express\nan important distinction between “epistemic” and\n“non-epistemic” seeing. However, the view that perceptual\ncontent is non-propositional is not the same as the view that it is\n“non-epistemic” in Dretske’s sense. For ascriptions\nof non-epistemic seeing are intended to be fully extensional in their\nobject positions, but not all non-propositional descriptions of\nperception need be (for example, some have argued that “Macbeth\nsaw a dagger before him” does not entail “there is a\ndagger which Macbeth saw”: cf. Anscombe (1965)). The question of\nwhether perception has a propositional content is far from being\nsettled, even for those who think it has intentional content (see\nMcDowell (2008); Crane (2009)).  Another debate about the content of perceptual\nexperience—independent of the issue of whether it is\npropositional—is whether it is singular or general in nature\n(see Soteriou (2000); and for a more general discussion, see Chalmers\n(2006)). A singular content is one that concerns a particular object,\nand such that it cannot be the content of a state of mind unless that\nobject exists. Singular contents are also called\n“object-dependent”. A general content is one whose ability\nto be the content of any intentional state is not dependent on the\nexistence of any particular object. General contents are also called\n“object-independent”. Those who think (like Snowdon\n(1992), McDowell (1994), Brewer (2000)) that the content of perceptual\nexperience can be expressed by a sentence containing an irreducible\ndemonstrative pronoun (e.g., of the form “that F is\nG’) will also argue that the content of experience is\nsingular; those who think (like Davies (1992) and McGinn (1989)) that\nthe content of experience is general (e.g., of the form, “there\nis an F which is G”) are committed to its\nobject-independence. It might seem that an intentionalist must say\nthat the content of perception is wholly general. However, Burge\n(1991) has argued that any genuinely perceptual episode has an\nirreducibly singular element, even though the episode could share a\ncomponent of content with a numerically distinct episode. Martin\n(2002) argues that the availability of this position shows that\nintentionalism could deny that the content of experience is wholly\ngeneral.  The issue about whether the content of perceptual experience is\nsingular or general is not simply about whether the existence of the\nexperience entails or presupposes the existence of its object. An\nexample will illustrate this. Suppose for the sake of argument that\nexperience essentially involves the exercise of recognitional\ncapacities, and I have a capacity to recognise the Queen. Let’s\nsuppose too that this is a general capacity which presupposes her\nexistence. It is consistent with this to say that I could be in the\nsame intentional state when I am hallucinating the Queen, as when I am\nperceiving her. Although the capacity might depend for its existence\non the Queen’s existence, not every exercise of the capacity\nneed depend on the Queen’s presence. The capacity can\n“misfire”. Hence intentionalism can hold that experiences\nare the same in the hallucinatory and veridical cases, even though the\nexistence of the involved recognitional capacity presupposes the\nexistence of the object recognised.  The objects of intentional states are sometimes called\n“intentional objects” (Crane (2001: Chapter 1)). What are\nthe intentional objects of perceptual experience, according to\nintentionalists? In the case of veridical perception, the answer is\nsimple: ordinary, mind-independent objects like the churchyard, the\nsnow (etc.) and their properties. But what should be said about the\nhallucinatory case? Since this case is by definition one in which\nthere is no mind-independent object being perceived, how can we even\ntalk about something being an “object of experience” at\nall here? As noted above, intentionalists say that experiences are\nrepresentations; and one can represent what does not exist (see Harman\n(1990), Tye (1992)). This is certainly true; but isn’t there any\nmore to be said? For how does a representation of a non-existent\nchurchyard differ from a representation of a non-existent garbage\ndump, say, when one of those is hallucinated? The states seem to have\ndifferent objects; but neither of these objects exist (see the entry\nnonexistent-objects).   One proposal is that the objects of hallucinatory experience are\nthe properties which the hallucinated object is presented as having\n(Johnston (2004)). Another answer is to say that these hallucinatory\nstates of mind have intentional objects which do not exist (Smith\n(2002: Chapter 9)). Intentional objects in this sense are not supposed\nto be entities or things of any kind. When we talk about perception\nand its “objects” in this context, we mean the word in the\nway it occurs in the phrase “object of thought” or\n“object of attention” and not as it occurs in the phrase\n“physical object”. An intentional object is always an\nobject for a subject, and this is not a way of classifying things in\nreality. An intentionalist need not be committed to intentional\nobjects in this sense; but if they are not, then they owe an account\nof the content of hallucinatory experiences.  How does the content of perceptual experience differ from the\ncontent of other intentional states? According to some\nintentionalists, one main difference is that perception has\n“non-conceptual” content. The basic idea is that\nperception involves a form of mental representation which is in\ncertain ways less sophisticated than the representation involved in\n(say) belief. For example, having the belief that the churchyard is\ncovered in snow requires that one have the concept of a\nchurchyard. This is what it means to say that belief has conceptual\ncontent: to have the belief with the content that a is\nF requires that one possess the concept a and the\nconcept F. So to say perception has non-conceptual content is\nto say the following: to have a perception with the content that\na is F does not require that one have the concept of\na and the concept F. The idea is that one’s\nperceptual experience can represent the world as being a certain\nway—the “a is F” way—even if\none does not have the concepts that would be involved in believing\nthat a is F. (For a more detailed version of this\ndefinition, see Crane (1998a) and Cussins (1990); for a different way\nof understanding the idea of non-conceptual content, see Heck (2000)\nand Speaks (2005). The idea of non-conceptual content derives from\nEvans (1982); there are some similar ideas in Dretske (1981); see\nGunther (2002) for a collection of articles on this subject. Other\nsupport for non-conceptual content can be found in Bermúdez\n(1997); Peacocke (1992); Crowther (2006); for opposition see Brewer\n(2000) and McDowell (1994a)).  Critics of the intentional theory have argued that it does not\nadequately distinguish perceptual experience from other forms of\nintentionality, and therefore does not manage to capture what is\ndistinctive about experience itself. (McDowell (1994), Martin (2002),\nRobinson (1994: 164)).  One objection of this kind is that intentionalists can give no\naccount of the qualitative or sensory character of perceptual\nexperience. Experiencing something, unlike thinking about it, has a\ncertain “feel” to it. Yet, the objection runs,\nintentionalism has no resources to deal with this fact, since it\nexplains experience in terms of representation, and merely\nrepresenting something need have no particular “feel”\nwhatsoever. Believing that something is the case, for example, or\nhoping that something is the case, are both forms of mental\nrepresentation, but neither state of mind has any “feel”\nor qualitative character to call its own. (Words or images may come to\nmind when mentally representing something in this way, but it is not\nobvious that these are essential to the states of mind themselves.) So\nthe challenge is the following: if there is nothing about\nrepresentation as such which explains the “feel” of an\nexperience, how is experience supposed to be distinguished from mere\nthought?  There are a number of ways an intentionalist can respond. One is\nsimply to take it as a basic fact about perceptual intentionality that\nit has a qualitative or phenomenal character (see Kriegel\n(2013)). After all, this response continues, even those who believe in\nqualia have to accept that some states of mind have qualia and some do\nnot, and that at some point the distinction between mental states\nwhich are conscious/qualitative, and those which are not, just has to\nbe accepted as a brute fact.  Another response is to say that in order to explain the phenomenal\ncharacter of perceptual experience, we need to treat perception as\ninvolving non-intentional qualia as well as intentionality (see\nPeacocke (1983: Chapter 1); Shoemaker (1993); Block (1997)). There is,\naccordingly, a dispute between these intentionalists who accept qualia\n(like Block and Shoemaker) and those who don’t (like Harman\n(1990) or Tye (1992)). The first kind of intentionalist holds that in\naddition to its intentional properties, perceptual experience also\ninvolves qualia; the second kind denies this. (See the discussion of\n“the transparency of experience” in\n §1.1.3 above; and see Spener (2003)).  Consider the inverted spectrum argument (see the entry on\n inverted qualia). This argument is\nbased on an ancient speculation: that it is possible that two\npeople’s colour experience could vary massively and\nsystematically and that this difference be undetectable from the third\nperson perspective (see Shoemaker (1996)). For example, consider two\npeople Alice and Bob, whose colour perceptions are inverted relative\nto one another. Whenever Alice sees something red, Bob sees something\nblue and vice versa. Yet Alice and Bob each call all the same things\n“red”, and arguably believe that all the same things are\nred (fire engines, poppies etc.). It can further be argued that the\nrepresentational or intentional content of their belief that fire\nengines are red is derived from the representational content of their\nexperiences of red fire engines, since this belief is a perceptual\nbelief. What then explains their mental difference? Defenders of\nqualia say that what explains this is the difference in the qualia of\ntheir mental states. Alice and Bob are intentionally or\nrepresentationally identical—they represent the world in the\nsame way—they differ in the non-representational qualia of their\nexperience. (Intentionalists who deny qualia will dispute this by\nsaying that the difference between Alice and Bob is indeed a\nrepresentational difference: see Tye (2000) and Hilbert and Kalderon\n(2000). For more on the inverted spectrum, see Block (2007), Egan\n(2006), Marcus (2006). For other arguments attempting to establish\nqualia, see Block (1997), (2010), Peacocke (1983)). Consider the veridical experiences involved in cases of perception;\ncases where one genuinely sees or otherwise perceives an object for\nwhat it is. Like sense-datum theorists, and unlike intentionalists,\nnaive realists hold that such experiences themselves consist of\nrelations of awareness to objects. However, like intentionalists,\nnaive realists reject sense-data and appeal instead to ordinary\nobjects. So the naive realist holds, in contrast to both the\nsense-datum theory and intentionalism (and, adverbialism), that the\nveridical experiences involved in genuine cases of perception consist,\nin their nature, of relations to ordinary objects (Level 1). And this\nis put to work in explaining the phenomenal character of such\nexperiences (Level 2). Take the churchyard covered in white snow and\nsuppose one sees this for what it is. Why is this a case of things\nappearing white to one? Here the naive realist appeals to the real\npresence in the experience of the white snow itself. The character of\none’s experience is explained by an actual instance of whiteness\nmanifesting itself in experience. For the naive realist, the character of the experience one has in\nseeing the churchyard for what it is is constituted in part by the\nwhiteness of the snow itself and not by the representation of\nsuch whiteness where representation is understood as it is by the\nintentionalist: that is, where an experience’s representation of\nsomething as white is something which doesn’t require the\npresence of an actual instance of whiteness. And many naive realists\ndescribe the relation at the heart of their view as a\nnon-representational relation. This means that many naive\nrealists think of experience and its character as non-representational\nin this sense: (a) intentional content of the sort appealed to by the\nintentionalists to explain character is not appealed to, and (b) what\nis fundamental to experience is something which itself cannot\nexplained in terms of representing the world: a primitive relation of\nawareness to aspects of the world.  But care is needed here, for two reasons. First, neither (a) nor\n(b) entail that experience is non-representational tout\ncourt, that experiences don’t have representational\ncontent. For one might think of experience as representational in a\nway that is not tied to explaining phenomenal character (for instance\ncontent might be needed to explain experience’s epistemic\nrole). If one thought of experience as contentful in a way that is not\ntied to explaining character, that would not be to endorse\nintentionalism, nor would it be to reject (a) or (b). And second,\nMcDowell (2013) seems to be a naive realist who rejects (b), for he\nthinks that experience is relational in virtue of being contentful in\na certain way—a way which thus contrasts with the way in which\nexperience is contentful on non-relational views such as\nintentionalism.  (For further discussion see the articles in\nBrogaard (2014)).  The most prominent form of naive realism invokes (a) and (b). Such\nnaive realists assign an important explanatory role to the world\nitself, without the involvement of content, in explaining the\ncharacter of veridical experiences. It would be a mistake, however, to\nthink that such naive realists must think of veridical experiences as\nconsisting just in a simple two-place relation between a perceiver and\na worldly subject-matter whereby phenomenal character is constituted\nentirely by the presented subject-matter. This would mean that there\ncould be no variation in the phenomenal character without a variation\nin the presented subject-matter. But naive realists admit that even\nholding fixed the presented subject-matter there can be variation in\nthe character of experience. This is worked out in different (but\ncompatible) ways by different theorists. One approach is to keep the\nsimple two-place view, yet note how variations in the perceiver\nrelatum can make for variations in the character of experience (Logue\n(2012)). Another is to highlight a third-relatum which encapsulates\nvarious conditions of perception such as one’s spatiotemporal\nperspective, perceptual modality, and other conditions of perception\nvariation in which can make for variation in phenomenal character\n(Campbell (2009), Brewer (2011)). It makes sense to suppose that if a\ngiven experience is of a subject-matter from a certain viewpoint\n(Martin (1998)), or standpoint (Campbell (2009)), then variation in\nwhat goes into one having the particular viewpoint or standpoint one\nhas should make for variation in the phenomenal character. And we also\nneed to look at the relation of awareness itself. Many naive realists\nhold that there can be variation in the way or\nmanner in which one is related to a subject-matter which\nmakes a difference to phenomenal character (Soteriou (2013), Campbell\n(2014)). Thus naive realists will reject the transparency thesis as it\nis discussed in §1.1.3, specifically (ii).  Like intentionalists, naive realists want to maintain our ordinary\nconception of perceptual experience. They hold to both\nAwareness and Openness. Naive realists think that we\nare sometimes perceptually aware of ordinary objects: that’s\nwhat we have in veridical and illusory experiences (see\n §3.4.2). Such experiences are cases of\nsuch awareness. And perceptual experience satisfies\nOpenness. In veridical and illusory experiences, the\ncharacter of experience is a presentation of ordinary objects, and is\nimmediately responsive to the character of such objects because such\nobjects are literally involved in the experience, part constitutive of\nits character.\n \nHow, then, does the naive realist respond to the arguments which\nanimate the Problem of Perception? There are various different approaches available to a naive realist\nhere (see e.g., Fish (2009: Chapter 6), Brewer (2008, 2011: Chapter\n5), Kalderon (2011), Genone (2014), Campbell (2014)). But one approach\nis to target the base case. Naive realists, like intentionalists, can\nreject the Phenomenal Principle: in illusions it appears to one as if\nsomething is F even though one is not aware of anything which\nis F. When one sees a white wall as yellow, what one is aware\nof is a white wall, and that is not yellow. So how does naive realism\ndiffer from intentionalism about illusions? In two respects: first,\nnaive realists can group illusory experiences with veridical\nexperiences to the extent that they think of them as fundamentally\ncases of non-representational relations of awareness to ordinary\nobjects. Second, the naive realist can explain the character of such\nillusory experiences without appeal to intentional content, but\ninstead by appealing to ordinary objects, and their features. On this\nsecond difference, one approach is that developed by Brewer: So though o may not itself be F, it can exist in\ncertain conditions, C, such that it has visually relevant\nsimilarities to paradigm F things and in that sense it will\nobjectively look F, or look like an F\nthing—that is, it will itself have a property, a look or an\nappearance, independently of anyone actually clapping their eyes upon\nit (see also Martin (2010), Kalderon (2011) and Genone (2014) on\nobjective looks). If o is then seen in C, o\nitself will look F to one in perception. Brewer spells this\nall out in much more detail, and with various examples. One example is\nseeing a white piece of chalk as red. The chalk is seen in abnormal\nillumination conditions such that the white piece of chalk itself\nlooks like a paradigm red piece of chalk—it has ’visually\nrelevant similarities with a paradigm piece of chalk, of just that\nsize and shape’ (2011: 106). Given that it is seen in those\nconditions, it looks red to one, even though it is not in\nfact red. Here, then, we have an account of illusions in which we\nappeal to objects and the ways those objects are, not the ways the are\nrepresented to be, in explaining character. How does the naive realist deal with the argument from\nhallucination? The naive realist denies its conclusion (C) and unlike\nthe intentionalist wants to deny (C) read as \n(C*) veridical experiences are not fundamentally cases of\nperceptual awareness of ordinary objects.  They accept (A) and so block the argument by rejecting the\nspreading step (B) ((he Common Kind Assumption (CKA)). Suppose that,\nas the naive realist holds, when one sees a snow covered churchyard\nfor what it is, one has an experience which is in its nature a\nrelation between oneself and ordinary objects. Whatever an\nhallucinatory experience as of a snow covered churchyard is, it is not\nan event with that nature. For such a hallucination could\noccur quite apart from any relevant worldly items (e.g., in the lab of\na scientist manipulating your brain, in a world with no white\nthings). Instead of taking (B) and these facts about hallucinations as\ngrounds to reject the supposition of naive realism, the naive realist\ninstead gives up (B)/(CKA) and thinks of veridical experiences and\nhallucinatory experiences as of different fundamental kinds. (For a\nmuch more nuanced and detailed formulation of the naive realist\nthinking here, see Martin (2004), (2006)).  In blocking the argument from hallucination in this way the naive\nrealist takes on a disjunctive theory. The theory was first proposed\nby Hinton (1973) and was later developed by P.F. Snowdon (1979, 1990),\nJohn McDowell (1982, 1987) and M.G.F. Martin (2002, 2004,\n2006). Disjunctivism is not best construed as it is by one of its\nproponents, as the view “that there is nothing literally in\ncommon” in perception and hallucination, “no identical\nquality” (Putnam (1999: 152)). For both the perception of an\nX and a subjectively indistinguishable hallucination of an\nX are experiences which are subjectively indistinguishable\nfrom a perception of an X. What disjunctivists deny is that\nwhat makes it true that these two experiences are describable\nin this way is the presence of the same fundamental kind of mental\nstate. Disjunctivists reject what J.M. Hinton calls “the\ndoctrine of the ‘experience’ as the common element in a\ngiven perception” and an indistinguishable hallucination (Hinton\n(1973: 71)). The most fundamental common description of both states,\nthen, is a merely disjunctive one: the experience is either a genuine\nperception of an X or a mere hallucination of an\nX. Hence the theory’s name. But what support is there for the disjunctivist’s rejection\nof (CKA)? Some defenders of disjunctivism have claimed that there is a\nrelatively simple argument against the (CKA). Putnam, for example, has\nargued that since the common kind is defined by subjective\nindistinguishability, and since subjective indistinguishability is not\ntransitive, then it cannot define a sufficient condition for the\nidentity of states of mind, since identity is transitive (Putnam\n(1999: 130)). The argument that subjective indistinguishability is not\ntransitive derives from the so-called “phenomenal sorites”\nargument: the possibility that there could be a series of (say) colour\nsamples, arranged in a sequence such that adjacent pairs were\nsubjectively indistinguishable but that the first and last members of\nthe series were distinguishable. Hence sample 1 could be subjectively\nindistinguishable from sample 2, and so on; and sample 99 could be\nsubjectively indistinguishable from sample 100, but sample 1\nnonetheless be subjectively distinguishable from sample 100. Those who\nwant to defend (CKA) need, therefore, to respond to this argument; one\nway is to follow Graff (2001), and argue that the phenomenal sorites\nargument is in fact fallacious.   Taking a different approach, Martin (2002: 421) argues that each\nof the main theories of perception is an “error theory” of\nperception (in J.L. Mackie’s (1977) sense). That is, each theory\nconvicts common sense of an error about perception: for example, the\nsense-datum theory convicts common sense of making the erroneous\nassumption that perception is a direct awareness of mind-independent\nobjects. Against this background, Martin argues that abandoning (CKA)\nis the least revisionary position among all the possible responses to\nthe Problem of Perception, and thus follows Hinton (1973) in holding\nthe disjunctivist position to be the default starting point for\ndiscussions of perception. (A further approach is to be found in\nMcDowell (2008) who attempts to support disjunctivism on\nepistemological grounds.) Naive realism avoids the argument from hallucination by denying\n(CKA) and thus taking on disjunctivism. But some object to this and\ntry to support (CKA) with a so-called causal argument\n(Robinson (1994), Martin (2004, 2006), Nudds (2009, 2013)). Why might\none think that the kind of event that occurs in a veridical experience\nof a churchyard occurs in a subjectively indistinguishable\nhallucination? One way to justify this is with appeal to the idea that\nthe type of brain state which underpins each experiential occurrence\nis the same; the resulting experiences should thus be of the very same\nkind. That is, we can suppose that when S sees the snow\ncovered churchyard for what it is, there is some proximal cause of\nthis experience: the experience is preceded by a certain sort of brain\nstate B. But now we can imagine a situation in which we bring\nabout B thus producing an experience in S, yet where\nB is not brought about through any interaction between S\nand a snow covered churchyard—e.g., in laboratory\nconditions. In this scenario S has an hallucinatory\nexperience as of a snow covered churchyard. It is plausible to suppose\nthat these experiences are of the very same kind given that they have\nthe same proximal cause. Thus, (CKA). The point here is that (CKA)\nlooks like a plausible principle for causally matching\nveridical and hallucinatory experiences. This way of motivating (CKA) appeals to a same-cause, same effect\nprinciple. That is, \nCausal Principle 1: an event e1 is of the same\nkind as an event e2 if event e1 is produced by the\nsame kind of proximate causal condition as e2 (Nudds 2009:\n336). \nBut the naive realist should reject this principle. As Martin says The naive realist may well admit the possibility of veridical\nexperiences and causally matching hallucinations, but they will resist\nthe idea that sameness of cause implies sameness of the kind of\nexperience involved. This is because there are non-causal\nconditions constitutive conditions for the occurrence of the\nveridical experience which are not satisfied in the hallucinatory\ncase.  However, as Martin goes on to argue, this defence of (CKA)\ndoesn’t mean that the naive realist is in the clear. For the\narguer from hallucination can adopt a different strategy by adopting a\nmodified causal principle: \nCausal Principle 2: an event e1 is of the same\nkind K as an event e2 if event e1 is\nproduced by the same kind of proximate causal condition as e2\nin circumstances that do not differ in any non-causal conditions\nnecessary for the occurrence of an event of kind K (Nudds\n2009: 337). \n(Martin’s own modified causal principle is more complicated than\nthis in allowing for indeterministic causation. We gloss over this\nimportant complication here). Now the arguer from hallucination is\ntaking a different approach by appealing to Causal Principle 2 because\nthis will not allow the arguer to support (CKA). Take\nN to be the fundamental kind which characterizes a veridical\nexperience of a snow covered churchyard. Does Causal Principle 2 allow\nus to say that N is present in the causally matching\nhallucinatory case, as (CKA) predicts? No. For the hallucination is\nproduced in circumstances that differ in non-causal conditions\nnecessary for the occurrence of N given how the naive\nrealist understands N: in the circumstances in which the\nhallucination comes about there is no appropriate object of\nperception and that is necessary for the occurrence of N. So how does Causal Principle 2 help the arguer from hallucination?\nWe have to run an argument from hallucination in “the reverse\ndirection, from what must be true of cases of causally matching\nhallucinations, to what must thereby be true of the veridical\nperceptions they match” (Martin 2006: 368). That is, take a\nhallucination as of a snow covered churchyard h, and suppose\nthat h is of some fundamental kind H. Now we can\napply Causal Principle 2 to show that H is present in a\ncausally matching veridical experience of a snow covered\nchurchyard, v For now v is produced by the same\nkind of proximal cause in circumstances where there is no difference\nin the non-causal conditions necessary for the occurrence of an event\nof kind H. This is because all that is necessary for an\noccurrence of H is some brain condition, which is\npresent in the circumstances in which v is brought\nabout. This reverse causal argument does not show that v\nis not of fundamental kind N. What it does show,\nhowever, is that whatever fundamental kind is present in a causally\nmatching hallucinatory case will also be present in a\nveridical case. So even if v is fundamentally N it\nis also H. That is, we have the Reverse Common Kind\nAssumption: \n(RCKA) Whatever fundamental kind of event occurs when one\nhallucinates, the very same kind of event also occurs in a causally\nmatching veridical experience.  But now we run into the screening off problem for naive\nrealism (Martin 2004). There is something it is like for S to\nhave an hallucinatory experience as of a snow covered churchyard, and\nthe experience seems to relate the subject to a snow covered\nchurchyard. This fact about the hallucinatory experience is grounded\nin its being of kind H. But now if an experience of that kind\nis present in the veridical case, it is difficult to see how what the\nnaive realist says is fundamental to that case, N, is doing\nanything by way of explaining what it is like for a subject to have\nthe experience (Level 2). Consequently the presence of H in\nthe veridical case seems to make N explanatorily\nredundant. That the veridical experience is H seems to screen\noff its being N as what explains its phenomenal\ncharacter.  This is not the end of the road for naive realism, and the way to\nrespond to this problem divides naive realists. The most prominent\nview is the view of Martin (2004, 2006, 2013). On this view the\ndisjunctivist should conceive of H in a purely negative\nepistemic way. That is, what makes it the case that one’s\nhallucinatory experience is as of a snow covered churchyard, with a\ncertain sort of phenomenal character, is just that it is an occurrence\nwhich is indiscriminable from—cannot be told apart,\nintrospectively, from—a veridical perception of a snow covered\nchurchyard. The particular subjective perspective that a hallucinator\nhas in a causally matching hallucination as of a snow covered\nchurchyard is explained just by the obtaining of this negative\nepistemic condition. (Thus, arguably, Dancy’s (1995: 425) demand\nof the disjunctivist for a positive characterization of hallucination\nis misplaced, but see Hellie (2013)).   If this is all there is to the nature of H we can see how\nit can be present in both the hallucinatory and the veridical case:\nsince trivially a veridical experience of a snow covered churchyard is\nindiscriminable from a veridical experience of a snow covered\nchurchyard. But, crucially, the naive realist can deal with the\nscreening off problem. Does H have a nature which means that\nthe presence of H in the veridical case threatens the\nexplanatory power of N? Plausibly not, for it seems that\nH’s explanatory force is parasitic on that of\nN. As Martin notes with his own example: This, in broad outline, is Martin’s approach and one of the\nkey ways in which disjunctivism is developed out of naive\nrealism. With it, we can see how the idea that subjectively\nindistinguishable hallucinations satisfy Openness. They are,\nin their very character, as of ordinary objects which appear\nto one as there or present. It’s just that\nwhat grounds or explains this character is a negative epistemic\nfact. Further discussion and development of Martin’s approach is to\nbe found in Nudds (2009, 2013). For naive realists who have different\nreactions to the screening off problem and thus develop disjunctivism\nin a different way see Fish (2009), Logue (2012a), and Hellie\n(2013). For criticism of Martin’s approach see Hawthorne and\nKovakovich (2006), Farkas (2006), Sturgeon (2008), Siegel (2004,\n2008), and Robinson (2013). See Burge (2005) for a general and\npolemical attack on disjunctivism. For more on disjunctivism, see\nHaddock and Macpherson (eds.) (2008), Byrne and Logue (eds.) (2009),\nMacpherson and Platchias (eds.) (2013) and the entry on\n the disjunctive theory of perception.   The Problem of Perception has given rise to a significant ongoing\ndebate in the philosophy of perception: the debate between\nintentionalists on the one hand, and naive realists and disjunctivists\non the other. This is the greatest chasm in the philosophy of\nperception (Crane 2006). How is it that perceptual experience is an\nOpenness to the mind-independent world? Is it that some such\nexperiences are themselves in their nature non-representational\nrelations to ordinary objects? Or is it that they are in their\nnature non-relational representations of ordinary\nobjects?","contact.mail":"Craig.French@nottingham.ac.uk","contact.domain":"nottingham.ac.uk"}]
