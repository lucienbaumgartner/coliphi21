Many substantivalists also believe that there are entities\n(people, tables, social groups, electrons, fields, holes, events,\ntropes, universals, …) that are located at regions.\nThese philosophers face questions about the relationship between\nlocated entities and the regions at which they are located. Are\nlocated entities identical to their locations, as\nsupersubstantivalists maintain? Are they entirely separate from their\nlocations, in the sense that they share no parts with them?\n\n\nWithout prejudging these metaphysical questions, some philosophers\nhave formulated logics of location—typically in the form\nof groups of axioms or axiom-schemas governing a location relation and\nits interaction with parthood and other mereological relations. One\nmain aim of these logics is to capture the ways in which the\nmereological properties of and relations between located entities must\nmirror the mereological properties of and relations between the\nlocations of those entities.\n\n\nThe recent literature focuses largely on three questions, each\ncorresponding to a different way in which the relevant mirroring might\nfail:\n\nSay that two entities interpenetrate just in case\nthey do not share parts but their exact locations do. Is\ninterpenetration possible?\n\nSay that an extended simple is entity that has no\nproper parts but is exactly located at a region that does have proper\nparts. Are extended simples possible?\n\nSay that an entity is multilocated just in case\nit is exactly located at more than one region. Is multilocation\npossible?\n\nThe present article surveys recent work on these questions and\naddresses a number of other issues along the way.\n\nThis article focuses on the recent literature on location and\nmereology. On the history of these topics, see Marmodoro (2017), Harte\n(2002), Sorabji (1983, 1988), Pasnau (2011), and Holden (2004), as\nwell as the entries on\n ancient atomism,\n medieval mereology,\n atomism from the 17th to the 20th century,\n and\n mereology. \nIn keeping with the recent literature, we will focus on\n‘entity-to-region’ location relations—i.e., location\nrelations that paradigmatically hold between entities and\nregions. We will ignore location relations that hold between\nentities and nonregions. (Consider ‘the transmitter is located\nat the top of the ridge’. On its face, the top of the ridge is\nnot a region.) \nSince our focus is on entity-to-region location relations, we will\nwork under the following controversial but popular assumption: \nUnless otherwise noted, we will assume that regions are spacetime\nregions, where these are thought of in accordance with the\n‘Block Universe’ picture, as captured by the\nfollowing: \nRelatively little depends upon the Block Universe picture, however. If\none dislikes talk of spacetime, one should be able reinterpret most of\nwhat we say here in terms of regions of space without loss of\nplausibility. Further, we assume that \nSubregions as Parts contrasts with another fairly common view\naccording to which regions are sets of points and have their\nsubregions as subsets but not as parts. \nMore generally, we will assume that there is just one fundamental\nparthood relation, that this relation holds univocally both between\none region and another and between (say) one material object and\nanother, and that the given relation is a two-place relation. \nAll of these assumptions are controversial. Some philosophers have\nexplored the view that the fundamental parthood relation is\nthree-place (Thomson 1983; Hudson 2001; Balashov 2008; Donnelly 2010;\nMcDaniel 2014; Lafrance 2015) or four-place (Gilmore 2009;\nKleinschmidt 2011). Others have argued that one fundamental parthood\nrelation holds between regions, another between material objects\n(McDaniel 2004, 2009). And some have argued that there are no\nfundamental parthood relations (or other fundamental mereological\nrelations, such as overlapping). Of these philosophers, some propose\nreductive definitions of parthood, whereas others eliminate parthood\n(Dorr 2005; Sider 2013; Cowling 2014a), though the distinction between\nreduction and elimination is sometimes blurry. \nNolan (2014) calls attention to a range of reductionist proposals,\nwhich can be divided into three main strategies. \nA first strategy, which we can call the locationist strategy,\nis to define parthood in terms of the location relation together with\nthe subregion relation (Oppenheim and Putnam 1958; Markosian 2014).\nFor example, one might say that for x to be a part of y\nis for x's exact location to be a subregion of y's exact\nlocation. To avoid circularity, friends of the locationist strategy\nshould reject Subregions as Parts, in favor of either (i) the view\nthat regions are sets of points and x is a subregion of\ny if and only if both are regions and x is a subset of\ny or (ii) the view that subregionhood is primitive and\nfundamental. An objection to (i) is that regions are concrete, whereas\nsets are abstract, not concrete; an objection to (ii) is that positing\na fundamental relation of subregionhood seems very similar to, and\nprobably no more theoretically virtuous than, positing a fundamental\nparthood relation (though see Nolan 2014: 105–111). There are\ntwo main objections to the locationist strategy more generally. \nFirst, there is the objection from the topic-neutrality of parthood.\nThe idea here is that entities need not be located in space or\nspacetime to be parts or to have parts. For example, one might hold\nthat the word type ‘cat’ is a part of the sentence type\n‘the cat is on the mat’, despite the fact that neither is\nlocated. According to this objection, locational subregionhood is\nunnecessary for parthood. \nSecond, there is the objection from interpenetration, according to\nwhich an entity x is in some cases exactly located at a\nsubregion of the exact location of an entity y despite the fact\nthat x is not a part of y. For example, two bosons (or\ntropes or…) might have the same exact location without being\nparts of each other. (See Section 4 for further discussion.) If the\nobjection from interpenetration is correct, then locational\nsubregionhood is not sufficient for parthood \nA more radical reduction of parthood to (among other things) a\nlocation-like relation is developed in Bennett (2013), who proposes\nthat for x to be a part of y is for there to be an\nentity z such that (i) z is a parthood-slot in y\nand (ii) x occupies z. Bennett's views are discussed in\nFisher (2013), Cotnoir (2015), and Garbacz (2017). \nA second strategy, which we can call the monist strategy, is\navailable to supersubstantivalists (those who hold that each material\nobject is identical to a region). They can say that what it is for an\nentity x to be a part of an entity y is: (i) for\nx and y both to be material objects, i.e., both to be\namong those privileged regions that count as material objects, and\n(ii) for x to be a subregion of y. (Wake 2011 and Nolan\n2014 develop this strategy.) One virtue of the monist strategy is\nthat, unlike the locationist strategy, it does not need to invoke a\nfundamental location relation. But it is vulnerable to versions of\nmany of the same objections, including those concerning the proper\ntreatment of subregionhood, the objection from topic-neutrality of\nparthood, and the objection from interpenetration. \nA third strategy, which we can call the plural strategy, is\nto define parthood in terms of identity and the ‘is one\nof’ notion from plural logic (on which see\n plural quantification),\n as follows: for x to be a part of y is for x to\nbe one of some entities zz that (collectively) are identical to\ny (Bricker 2016: 270). But this strategy will be only as\nattractive as strong composition as identity, the\ncontroversial view that whenever some things xx compose a thing\ny, xx are identical to y. (See Wallace (2011a, b)\nand the essays in Cotnoir and Baxter (2014) for discussion and further\nreferences.) (A hybrid of the first and third strategies is pursued by\nMcDaniel (2014: 21), who defines a three-place parthood relation in\nterms of a three-place, region-relative identity relation and a\ntwo-place subregionhood relation.) \nFor a defense of the view that parthood is fundamental, see Eddon\n(2017). \nWe now turn to the logic of the parthood relation. (See the entry on\n mereology\n for much more detail.) Here we assume merely that parthood is\nreflexive and transitive (a ‘preorder’). In a first-order\nlanguage with identity and a primitive two-place predicate\n‘P(x,y)’ for parthood, we can write:\n \nWe will also find it convenient to have predicates for overlapping,\ndisjointness, proper parthood, simplicity, complexity, gunkiness, and\nmereological coincidence. We define them as follows: \nFinally, if we supplement our first-order language with plural\nquantifiers and variables and the predicate\n‘x&pr;yy’ for ‘x is one of\nyy’ (see the entry on\n plural quantification),\n we can define a fusion predicate: \nWe will treat the expressions ‘y is composed of\nxx’ and ‘y is a sum of xx’ as\nsynonyms of ‘y fuses xx’. \nThis entry addresses questions framed in terms of modal notions. Are\nextended simples possible? Is it necessary that nothing is\nmultilocated? All talk of possibility and necessity in what follows\nshould be understood as talk of metaphysical possibility and\nmetaphysical necessity, respectively. In keeping with current\northodoxy, we assume that being metaphysically necessary (a property\nof propositions or sentences) is not to be identified with being a\nlogical truth, being an analytic truth, being a conceptual truth, or\nbeing an a priori truth. Although metaphysical necessity is\nnot identified with conceptual truth—and, correlatively,\nmetaphysical possibility is not identified with\nconceivability—one might still think that conceivability (or\nsomething in that vicinity) is evidence for metaphysical possibility.\nSee Chalmers (2002) for distinctions between various sorts of\nconceivability and for discussion of how each of them connects or\nfails to connect to metaphysical possibility. Also see the entry on\n the epistemology of modality. \nOne last preliminary. For better or worse, the recent literature on\nlocation and mereology tends to bracket considerations of vagueness\nand indeterminacy (though see Eagle 2016a) and quantum theory (though\nsee Pashby 2016). We will do the same. \nDebates about location have been framed in terms of two main\nlocational predicates: ‘is exactly located at’ and\n‘is weakly located at’. Philosophers tend to agree about\nhow these predicates apply in particular cases, and they tend to agree\nthat one of these predicates should be taken as primitive and used to\ndefine the other. But there is disagreement about which to define and\nwhich to take as primitive. (Though certain exotic possibilities\ninvolving gunky objects (Leonard 2014) or extended simple regions\n(Kleinschmidt 2016) generate pressure to posit more than one\nfundamental location relation.) \nHere is a typical informal gloss for ‘is exactly located\nat’: an entity x is exactly located at a region y\nif and only if x has (or has-at-y) exactly the same\nshape and size as y and stands (or stands-at-y) in all\nthe same spatial or spatiotemporal relations to other entities as does\n y.[1]\n Thus, small cubes are exactly located only at small cubical regions,\nlarge spheres are exactly located only at large spherical regions, and\nso on (see Casati and Varzi 1999: 119–120; Bittner, Donnelly,\nand Smith 2004; Gilmore 2006: 200–202; Sattig 2006: 48). \nHere is a typical informal gloss for ‘is weakly located\nat’: an entity x is weakly located at a region y\nif and only if y is ‘not completely free of’\nx (Parsons 2007: 203). Thus I am weakly located at a certain\nregion, r, whose shape, size, and position perfectly match my\nown, I am weakly located at the bottom half of that region, I am\nweakly located at a certain much larger region, r+,\nthat has r as a proper part, and I am weakly located at a\ncertain scattered region, r*, that's made up of the bottom half\nof r together with a small region somewhere in Siberia. In\nshort, if r is the one and only region at which I am exactly\nlocated, then I am weakly located at just those regions that overlap\nr. \nFigure 1 \nFigure 1 illustrates exact location and weak location. The dotted\nlines indicate regions\n(r1–r5). The shaded circle\nindicates a disc-shaped object, d, that is located at regions.\nIn the diagram, d is exactly located at\nr4 but not at r1,\nr2, r3, or r5,\nand d is weakly located at r2,\nr3, r4, and r5\nbut not at r1. \nAssuming that we now grasp the intended relations, we are in a\nposition to consider proposals about how the associated predicates\nmight be defined. Suppose that we take ‘x is exactly\nlocated at y’ as primitive and symbolize it as\n‘L(x, y)’ (Casati and Varzi 1999).\nThen, as Parsons (2007: 204) notes, the following definition of\n‘is weakly located at’ (‘WKL’) is\nnatural: \nOne consequence of (D9) is that the following principle \nis an analytic truth (Parsons 2007). This might be seen as a drawback,\nfor the following reason among others (Gilmore 2006: 203; Parsons\n2007: 207–9). One might think that the following situation is\npossible: (i) all regions are extended and gunky and decompose into\nsmaller (but still extended and still gunky) regions, (ii) some\nlocated entities are point-like and unextended, and (iii)entities are\nlocated only at regions. A point-like entity will be too small to be\nexactly located in any extended region, but it should still be weakly\nlocated at many regions—in particular, at each in a series of\nnested regions that ‘converge’ on the point-like entity.\nSo, if it's possible that (i)–(iii) are all true, then it's\npossible that, contrary to Exactness, a thing is weakly located\nsomewhere without being exactly located anywhere. \nOn the other hand, suppose that we take ‘WKL’ as\nprimitive. How might we use this predicate to define\n‘L’? This is less obvious, but the definition that\nParsons (2007: 205) proposes is \nTo see how this definition works, return to the object d in\nFigure 1. We want it to turn out that d is exactly located at\nr4 and nowhere else. Given the natural assumptions\nabout which regions are parts of which, (D10) delivers the desired\nverdicts. \nFor example, (D10) tells us that d is not exactly located at\nr3, for the reason that r3\noverlaps certain regions (e.g., r1) at which\nd is not weakly located. In other words, r3\n‘overlaps regions it shouldn't’. The situation with\nr5 is reversed. (D10) tells us that d is not\nexactly located at r5, for the reason that there are\nregions at which d is weakly located (e.g.,\nr2) that r5 does not\noverlap. In other words, r5 ‘fails to overlap\nregions it should’. Region r2 has both vices:\nit overlaps certain regions it shouldn't (e.g., its southeast corner),\nand it fails to overlap certain regions it should (e.g.,\nr5). Region r4 has neither vice.\nHence d counts as being exactly located at it, according to\n(D10). \nOne potential problem with (D10), however, is that it makes the\nfollowing principle \nan analytic truth. As we will see in\n Section 6,\n there are many who would deny Quasi-functionality, and there are\nothers who deny that it is necessary. \nIn the spirit of van Inwagen (1981), one might take the fundamental\nlocation relation to be lying-within, where this holds only between a\nsimple spacetime point, on the one hand, and a located entity, on the\nother. One might then define exact location in terms of it, as\nfollows: ‘x is exactly located at y’ means\nthe same as ‘for any z, if z is simple, then:\nz lies within x if and only if z is a part of\ny’. This has consequences similar to those of (D10). It\nhas the additional disadvantage that, in the context of gunky\nspacetime, it yields the result that everything is exactly located\neverywhere. \nIs it possible to do without any fundamental location relations? For\nsubstantivalists, there are two main strategies. \nFirst, there is the supersubstantivalist strategy.\nSupersubstantivalists say that each material object is identical to\nthe region that is its exact location. A first attempt at a\nsupersubstantivalist definition of exact location is this: for\nx to be exactly located at y is for x to be\nidentical to y. But this faces counterexamples involving\nabstract entities. The empty set is identical to itself but is not\nexactly located at itself. A natural repair invokes either the notion\nof a region (for those who are willing to say that all regions are\nexactly located at themselves) or the notion of a material object (for\nthose who are not): for x to be exactly located at y is\nfor x to be a region (alternatively: a material object) and\nidentical to y. Weak location can then be defined via (D9).\nThis account of exact location makes it hard to avoid full-blown\nMereological Harmony, as captured by (H1)–(H8) below. (See\nSection 3.) As a result, every threat to Mereological Harmony,\nincluding the arguments for interpenetration, extended simples, and\nmutlilocation, is thereby a threat to the given account of exact\nlocation. But by the same token, one might argue that every instance\nof Mereological Harmony is explained by, and hence confirms, the\nsupersubstantivalist strategy. \nA variant of the supersubstantivalist strategy is available to those\nwho deny that located entities are identical to their locations,\nprovided that they are willing to say that those entities\nmereologically coincide with their locations. They can say that for\nx to be exactly located at y is for y to be a\nregion and for x to mereologically coincide with y\n(Hawthorne 2006: 118, note 18). \nSecond, there is the relativizing strategy. As noted above,\nsome philosophers hold that the fundamental parthood relation is\nthree-place or four-place, with the additional argument places\nreserved for locations of the part and/or the whole. For example, to\nallow for multilocation and mereological variation from one location\nto another, Gilmore (2014b: 21) suggests taking the predicate\n‘x at y is a part of z at w’\nas primitive and using it to define ‘x is exactly located\nat y’, as ‘for some z and some w:\neither x at y is a part of z at w or\nz at w is a part of x at y’. The\ndefinition of the existence-at relation in Thomson (1983) is an\nearly example of this strategy. To keep things simple, however, we will\ncontinue to assume that the fundamental parthood relation is\ntwo-place. So we will set the relativizing strategy aside. \nMost of the formal work on location has focused on questions about how\nlocation interacts with parthood. But there are important questions\nabout location in its own right. Here we highlight two groups of\nquestions. \nWe will assume that exact location, not weak location, is the unique,\nfundamental location relation. We will also assume that (i) it is a\ntwo-place relation, and (ii) both argument places in that relation are\nsingular. (On the distinction between singular and plural argument\nplaces in relations, see Yi (1999).) But both (i) and (ii) have been\nquestioned. \nFor example, one might reject (i) in favor of the view that exact\nlocation is a three-place relation that holds between a located\nentity, a region of space, and an instant of time (Thomson 1983, Costa\n2017). This is a natural view for those who accept Eternalism and the\nB-theory but deny the Spacetime View, and instead think of space as a\nthree-dimensional entity that endures through, and is separate from,\ntime. (This picture is discussed in Skow 2015 and Gilmore, Costa and\nCalosi 2016.) To allow for the possibility of motion, those who\nendorse such a view will want to be able to say, of a given material\nobject, that it is exactly located at region r1, not\nat region r2, at time t1, and that\nthe same object is exactly located at r2, not at\nr1, at time t2. To allow for the\npossibility that time is gunky and does not contain instants, one\nmight take exact location to be expressed by ‘x is\nexactly located at region r within interval s’. A\ndifferent option is to reject (i) in favor of the view that exact\nlocation is variably polyadic, an idea floated by Jones (forthcoming:\nnote 29). \nAlternatively, one might agree that exact location is a two-place\nrelation but reject (ii) above in favor of the view that, say, the\nsecond argument place in exact location (the ‘location’\nslot) is plural. One idea is that an extended object can be exactly\nlocated at many points, collectively, without being exactly located at\nany one of them individually or at the set or fusion of them. This is\nsuggested by Hudson (2005: 17); motivations are developed in Gilmore\n(2014b: 25). In principle, one could also hold that the first argument\nplace in exact location (the ‘occupant’ slot) is\nplural. \nIf we assume that exact location is the one fundamental locational\nrelation, that it's two-place, and that both of its argument places\nare singular, what should we say about its behavior? Here we confine\nour attention to purely locational principles, i.e., principles that\ncan be stated in a first-order language with identity whose only\nnon-logical predicate is ‘L(x,\ny)’. \nCasati and Varzi (1999: 121) propose two principles: \nFunctionality bans multilocation, which we discuss at some length in\nSection 6. It tells us that nothing bears the exact location relation\nto more than one entity. Functionality leaves open the possibility of\nentities (regions, numbers, …) that do not bear that relation\nto anything. \nAccording to Conditional Reflexivity, exact locations are exactly\nlocated at themselves. (See also Donnelly (2004: 158), who presents a\nsystem in which Conditional Reflexivity is a theorem, though she\nreplaces the location predicate ‘L’ with a\nprimitive function symbol ‘r’ for ‘the exact\nlocation of’.) To appreciate the significance of Conditional\nReflexivity, suppose that Obama is exactly located at region r.\nTogether with Conditional Reflexivity, this entails that r is\nexactly located at itself. This conflicts with a purely locational\nprinciple endorsed by Simons (2004b: 345): \nCases in which a region is exactly located at itself do not conflict\nwith \nThus the Antisymmetry of Location may salvage some of the motivation\nfor the Asymmetry of Location while still harmonizing with Conditional\nReflexivity. The Antisymmetry of Location is a logical consequence of\nFunctionality and Conditional Reflexivity (as is the view that exact\nlocation is transitive). \nIf we further assume that Obama is not identical to his exact location\nr, we get the result that there are two different entities\nexactly located at r—namely, r and Obama. In that\ncase, we have a counterexample to another purely locational principle\nthat some have found attractive, namely: \nOpponents of co-location may take this as a reductio of\nConditional Reflexivity. Others may take it as a reason to reject the\nInjectivity of Location in favor of a weaker variant, e.g.: \nConditional Injectivity is equivalent to the claim that whenever two\ndifferent entities share a given exact location, one of them is\nidentical to that location. This may salvage some of the motivation\nfor the ban on co-location, while still harmonizing with Conditional\nReflexivity. \nWith Conditional Reflexivity as a backdrop, Casati and Varzi (1999:\n123) define a predicate for regionhood, ‘R’: \nTogether with Conditional Reflexivity, (DR) entails that that if\nx is exactly located at y, then y is exactly\nlocated at itself and hence is a region. But the (DR) + Conditional\nReflexivity package also allows for cases in which an entity r\ncounts as a region even though nothing but r is exactly located\nat r. \nThe regionhood predicate is potentially useful in stating restricted\nversions of familiar mereological principles. One might want a\nprinciple to the effect that any plurality of regions has a\nfusion, while remaining neutral on the more general claim that any\nplurality of entities whatever has a fusion. Likewise one might want a\nprinciple to the effect that non-identical regions never\nmereologically coincide, while rejecting the stronger claim that\nnon-identical entities in general never mereologically coincide.\n(Perhaps a certain clay statue mereologically coincides with, but is\nnot identical to, a certain lump of clay.) The most natural\nformulations of these restricted principles employ a regionhood\npredicate. Though one might take this predicate as primitive,\nconsiderations of ideological parsimony provide some motivation for\ntreating it as defined. \nTo close this section, it is worth drawing attention to another\nlogical consequence of Functionality and Conditional Reflexivity,\nnamely: \nThis says that exact locations are exactly located only at themselves\n(hence that ‘chains’ of exact location are always\n‘short’). To see why this follows from Functionality and\nConditional Reflexivity, suppose that x is exactly located at\ny. Then by Conditional Reflexivity, y is exactly located\nat y. If y is also exactly located at z, then by\nFunctionality, y=z. \nShortness of Location might also appeal to those who accept\nConditional Reflexivity but deny Functionality. Since Shortness of\nLocation does not follow from Conditional Reflexivity alone, some may\nwish to adopt Shortness as an axiom. \nPhilosophers have put forward of variety of axiom systems that are\nmeant to capture the interaction between parthood and location. One\nespecially bold idea is that the mereological properties of, and\nrelations between, located entities perfectly match those of\ntheir locations. This has been dubbed Mereological Harmony\n(Schaffer 2009). \nFor a collection of axioms that makes no attempt enforce Mereological\nHarmony, see the supplementary document on\n An Interpenetration-Friendly Theory of Location.\n  \nMereological Harmony has been captured formally in different ways by\nVarzi (2007), Uzquiano (2011), and Leonard (2016). Saucedo (2011:\n227–228) offers the following principles: \nSome philosophers take Mereological Harmony to be a necessary truth\n(Schaffer 2009:\n 138).[2]\n The remainder of this entry considers three separate threats to the\nview that Mereological Harmony is necessary: interpenetration\n (§4),\n extended simples\n (§5),\n and multilocation\n (§6). \nThere are other threats to Mereological Harmony that we will not\ndiscuss, e.g., threats to H7 and H8 that arise from ‘moderate\nviews about receptacles’, according to which only topologically\nopen (alternatively: only topologically closed) regions can be exact\nlocations (see Cartwright 1975; Hudson 2005: 47–56; and\nespecially Uzquiano 2006), or threats to H4 discussed in Uzquiano\n(2011).) \nA case of interpenetration occurs when non-overlapping entities have\noverlapping exact locations—e.g., when a ghost passes through a\nwall. In such a case, the right-to-left direction of H7 fails. Similar\ncases involve violations of the right-to-left directions of H5 and H6.\nAn extended simple is a simple entity with a complex exact location:\nit violates the left-to-right direction of H1, the right-to-left\ndirection of the (equivalent) H2, and the left-to-right direction of\nthe instance of H3 that results from letting n = 1. A case of\nmultilocation occurs when a given entity has more than one exact\nlocation. This violates Functionality, which is left implicit in\nSaucedo's statement of Mereological Harmony. \nThe three questions that we will consider—Is interpenetration\npossible? Are extended simples possible? Is multilocation\npossible?—are logically independent of one another. Thus there\nis room for eight specific packages of views. See Figure 2. \nIt is important to note that even if interpenetration, extended\nsimples, and multilocation are all possible, some substantive\nprinciples linking parthood and location may still survive. For\nexample, the possibility of interpenetration and extended simples\nposes no threat to: \nExpansivity rules out cases like the following (Figure 3), in which\nthe object a is a part of the object o, but a's\nexact location, ra, is not a part of\no's exact location, r. \nThe idea behind Delegation is that if x is complex, then if you\nstick a pin into x's exact location, you will have stuck that\npin into the exact location of one of x's proper parts as well.\nIn slightly different terms, a complex entity can't be weakly located\nat a certain region unless one of its proper parts—a\n‘delegate’—is weakly located at that region as well.\n(Regarding the formal statement of Delegation, one might wonder why it\nis not formulated with ‘PP(u, y)’ in\nplace of ‘O(u, y)’ in the consequent.\nThe reason for this is that Delegation is meant to be friendly to\nextended simples. Suppose that a complex, spherical object, C,\nis exactly located a spherical region, r. Suppose that C\nis composed of two hemispherical simples, h and h*, and\nthat r is composed of continuum-many simple points, each\nplurality of which composes a region that is a part of r. Then,\ncontrary to the proposed revision, it will not be true that for every\npart y of r, some proper part of C is exactly\nlocated at a region that has y as a proper part. Consider, for\nexample, the spherical region r* with the same center point as,\nbut half the volume as, r itself. C does not have a\nproper part that is exactly located at r*, nor does it have a\nproper part whose exact location has r* as a proper part. But,\nas Delegation requires, C does have a proper part (h,\nfor example) that has an exact location that overlaps r*.) \nDelegation rules out cases like the following (Figure 4), in which\no* is a complex object that is exactly located at region\nr*, but r* has a part ra that\ndoes not overlap an exact location of any of o*'s proper\nparts: \nNeither interpenetration nor extended simples seem to threaten\nExpansivity or Delegation. \nA potential threat to Delegation comes from Pickup (2016: 260), who\nconsiders the possibility of a complex entity that is exactly located\nsomewhere despite the fact that none of its proper parts is exactly\n(or weakly) located anywhere. One route to such entities (not\nPickup's) runs as follows: (i) some material objects (electrons,\nmaybe) do not have any other material objects as proper parts, (ii)\nany such material object is a complex entity whose only proper parts\nare universals, (iii) all material objects have locations, but (iv) no\nuniversals have locations. Bundle theorists who are platonic realists\nabout universals, and who take the constituents of a given bundle to\nbe parts of that bundle, will face pressure to accept (i)–(iv)\nand hence to reject Delegation. The same basic idea is discussed in\nconnection with the Burying Strategy in Section 4.1 below. \nIn this section we consider arguments for and against the following\nprinciple: \nAccording to No Interpenetration, it is metaphysically impossible for\nentities of any type to ‘pass through one another’ without\nsharing parts—in the manner of a ghost passing through a solid\nbrick wall. There is a related principle that deserves some comment.\nThe related principle says that, necessarily, if x's exact\nlocation is a part of y's exact location, then x is a\npart of y. In symbols: \nThis principle may seem to say basically the same thing as No\nInterpenetration but to say it more simply—using the primitive\npredicate ‘P’ instead of the defined predicate\n‘O’. Why then focus on No Interpenetration instead\nof (1)? \nThe reason for this is that some of the opposition to (1) will stem\nfrom opposition to a purely mereological principle: Strong\nSupplementation. It says that if every part of x overlaps\ny, then x is a part of y. Those who deny this\nwill be very likely to deny (1), but they might still be attracted to\nNo Interpenetration. Let Lump1 be a lump of clay, and let Goliath be\nthe statue that is ‘made out of’ Lump1. One might think\nthat every part of Goliath overlaps Lump1 (and vice versa), and that\nGoliath's exact location is a part of (indeed, identical to) Lump1's\nexact location, but that Goliath is not a part of Lump1 (Lowe 2003).\nIn that case one will reject (1). But one might still go on to say\nthat ‘ghostly-interpenetration-without-part-sharing’ is\nimpossible, and hence that No Interpenetration is true. After all,\nGoliath and Lump1 share parts, as do Goliath's top two-thirds and\nLump1's bottom two-thirds, and so on. \nIn general, our task here is to set aside the purely mereological\ncontroversies (see the entry on\n mereology)\n and to focus instead on the issues that are exclusively concerned\nwith location and its interaction with parthood. Too much of the\ncontroversy over (1) arises from controversy over ‘pure\nmereology’. By contrast, if No Interpenetration is\ncontroversial, this is only because of what it says about the\nconnections between parthood and location. \nImmanent realists say that a universal is in some sense ‘wholly\npresent’ in each thing that instantiates it (Armstrong 1978: 79;\nBigelow 1988; O’Leary-Hawthorne 1995; Smith 1997;\nO’Leary-Hawthorne and Cover 1998; Paul 2002, 2006, 2012; Newman\n2002; Hawley and Bird 2011; Lafrance 2015; Peacock 2016). This makes\nit natural to hold that disjoint universals frequently\ninterpenetrate. \nTo see why, let e be an electron, and suppose that it\ninstantiates two different universals: a mass universal,\num, and a charge universal,\nuc. Suppose that e is exactly located\nat region r. Then it will be natural for the immanent realist\nto say that (i) um is exactly located at\nr as well, or at least at some region\nrm that has r as a part, and (ii)\nuc is exactly located at r or at some\nregion rc that has r as a part. (If\nthese universals are also instantiated elsewhere, then it will be\ndebatable as to whether they are exactly located at r.\nPerhaps um has only one exact location, which\nfuses the exact locations of its instances (Effingham 2015). Likewise\nfor uc.) Either way, the immanent realist\nwill say that um and\nuc have exact locations that overlap. But\npresumably um and uc\ndo not overlap. Assuming that these universals are non-structural,\nnon-conjunctive, and perfectly natural, they are plausibly\nsimple, in which case they overlap only if they are\nidentical, which they are not. It would seem that a similar point can\nbe made in terms of\n tropes—particular,\n spatiotemporally located ‘cases’ of properties or\nrelations. For trope theorists who take tropes to be located at\nspacetime regions, it will be natural to say that mass tropes and\ncharges tropes, for example, frequently interpenetrate. (Since\nelectrons have charge and mass, trope theorists will find it natural\nsay that if an electron is exactly located at a region r, then\nthe electron's mass trope and the electron's charge trope are both\nexactly located at r as well, hence that those tropes'\nlocations overlap (by being identical). But presumably the tropes\nthemselves are not identical and do not overlap. Three responses to\nthis argument are worth considering. \nThe first response says: so much the worse for tropes and immanent\nuniversals. This response uses a mereo-locational principle, No\nInterpenetration, as a premise in an argument against certain\nmetaphysical views, namely those that posit tropes or immanent\nuniversals. Is there some reason why mereo-locational principles\nshould not be used in this way? The principles of pure mereology are\noften so used. For example, Lewis (1999: 108–110) rejects states\nof affairs and structural universals on the grounds that they would\nviolate the Uniqueness of Composition, the principle that no entities\nxx have more than one\n fusion.[5]\n Why not give the same status to certain mereo-locational principles?\nWhy not, for example, say that No Interpenetration is better justified\nthan is the view that universals or tropes are spatiotemporally\nlocated? True, it is hard to say much by way of argument for No\nInterpenetration. But the same can be said of various purely\nmereological principles, such as the Transitivity of Parthood, and\nthis is often treated as a non-negotiable constraint that any\nmetaphysical position must obey. \nThe second response says that while immanent universals or tropes are\nspatiotemporal entities that are ‘in their instances’,\nthey are not exactly located anywhere. Armstrong writes that \nTalk of the location of universals, while better than placing them in\nanother realm, is also not quite appropriate… To talk of\nlocating universals in space-time then emerges as a crude way of\nspeaking. Space-time is not a box into which universals are put.\nUniversals are constituents of states of affairs. Space-time is a\nconjunction of states of affairs. In that sense, universals are\n“in” spacetime. But they are in it as helping to\nconstitute it. (1989: 99) \nSimplified somewhat, the response holds that (i) universals are parts\nor constituents of entities that have exact locations, and in that\nsense they are ‘in their instances’, but (ii) universals\ndo no themselves have exact locations and hence do not have\noverlapping exact locations. Given (ii), the universals or tropes in\nquestion no longer count as examples of interpenetration. Call this\nthe Burying Strategy, since it ‘buries’\nuniversals and/or tropes in located entities, rather than treating\nthem as being located. \nHere is an especially vivid instance of the Burying Strategy: All\ntropes are instantaneous, spatially point-sized, and\nmereologically simple. All spacetime points are\ninstantaneous, spatially point-sized, and mereologically complex. In\nparticular, each spacetime point is a fusion of some tropes (each of\nwhich is at zero distance from each of the rest), and each trope is a\npart of exactly one spacetime point. Something counts as a\nspacetime region if and only if it is either a\nspacetime point or a fusion of some spacetime points. Each spacetime\nregion is exactly located at itself and nothing else has an exact\nlocation. \nOn this view, tropes are parts of spacetime points and regions but\nthey do not have exact locations. Hence, even if two tropes are both\nparts of the same spacetime point, they do not interpenetrate, in our\nsense. \nThe third response to the argument from universals and tropes is to\nsay, ‘True, universals and/or tropes can interpenetrate, but\nmaterial objects can't’. This grants the argument and rejects No\nInterpenetration in favor of a weaker, restricted principle. If we\nintroduce a one-place predicate, ‘M’, for ‘is\na material object’, then we can state the restricted principle\nas \nThis response also handles potential counterexamples to No\nInterpenetration arising from regions, sets, events, portions of\nstuff, holes, spirits, and other ‘immaterial\nentities’. \n(On the location of regions, see Casati and Varzi (1999: 123), who\nhold that regions are located at themselves, and Simons (2004b: 345),\nwho holds that nothing is located at itself. On the location of sets,\nsee Maddy (1990), Lewis (1991), Effingham (2010b; 2012), and Cook\n(2012). On the location of events, see Casati and Varzi (1999), Price\n(2007), Giordani and Costa (2013, 2016) and Costa (2017). On the\nlocation of portions of stuff, see Markosian (1998), (2004a), and\n(2015). On the location of holes and shadows, see Lewis and Lewis\n(1970), Casati and Varzi (1994), Wake, Spencer, and Fowler (2007),\nDonnelly, Bittner, and Rosse (2006), and Sorensen (2008). On the\nlocation of spirits, see Thomas (2009) and Inman (2017). Sanford\n(1970) discusses many of these topics, and Hudson (2005: 4) mentions\nmany of them briefly.) \nThe next two pro-interpenetration arguments count equally against No\nInterpenetration and (2), but we will continue to focus on No\nInterpenetration for simplicity. \nSome think that it is possible for two disjoint material\nobjects to have overlapping exact locations. Perhaps there are no\nactual cases of the relevant sort. Such cases may even be physically\nimpossible—ruled out by the laws of nature (though see the next\nsection). But one might still think that these cases are\nmetaphysically possible. \nAfter all, what is it that keeps material objects from\ninterpenetrating in the actual world? Repulsive forces, presumably.\nBut a standard view is that the laws governing such forces are not\nmetaphysically\n necessary.[6]\n And on that assumption it is natural to conclude that there are\nmetaphysically possible worlds in which any repulsive forces that\nexist can be overridden in such a way as to allow material objects to\ninterpenetrate. (For more on this, see Zimmerman 1996a and Sider\n2000.) \nA similar line of thought is sometimes framed as a conceivability\nargument. One might take cases of interpenetration to be conceivable\nor intuitively possible, and one might take this to be some evidence\nfor their possibility. In New Essays the Human Understanding\n(II.xxvii.1), Leibniz writes that \nwe find that two shadows or two rays of light interpenetrate, and we\ncould devise an imaginary world where bodies did the same. (1704\n[1996]) \nSanford describes such a scenario in more detail: \nWhat imaginable circumstances would tempt us to say that two\n[disjoint] things were in the same place at the same time? Imagine two\nrectangular blocks of the same size and shape each moving along a\nstraight path perpendicular to the other. The blocks approach the\nintersection of the paths at the same time, and apparently neither\nslows down nor changes its direction. They seem to pass right through\none another, and they do this without changing with respect to colour,\ntexture, density, etc. We want to say that we have the same two blocks\nwith which we started. And we do not want to say that either block\npassed out of existence and was shortly thereafter re-created. Thus we\nwant to say that each block moved along its path without any\nspatio-temporal discontinuity. And we can say this only if we admit\nthat parts of one block simultaneously occupied the same space as\nparts of the other block. (1967: 37) \nAn objection suggests itself. Why think that, in this scenario, the\nblocks really are disjoint while they are passing through one\nanother? \nIn response, one might just stipulate that what is under\nconsideration are two always-disjoint blocks, and then insist that the\ncase remains conceivable, so described. \nAlternatively, one might further specify the case in such a way as to\nbe able to argue for the blocks' disjointness. Consider a certain\nregion, r, that is said by Sanford to the exact location of two\ndisjoint material objects: p1 (a part of Block 1)\nand p2 (a part of Block 2). One might add that two\nincompatible properties are instantiated at r—say, having\nmass of 2 kg, and having mass of\n3 kg—where each of these properties is such that if it is\ninstantiated by an entity x, then it is instantiated by\nanything that mereologically coincides with x. Presumably this\nis no less conceivable (or ‘intuitively possible’) than\nSanford's original case. But in this new version of the case, it is\nnot open to Sanford's opponent to claim that the co-located objects\nare identical or mereologically coincident with each other. For the\nregion contains a 2 kg object and a 3 kg object, and no one object is\nidentical to (or mereologically coincident with) both a 2 kg object\nand a 3 kg object. \nOne question that has been raised in the recent philosophical\nliterature is whether contemporary physics provides us with examples\nof disjoint fundamental particles that have the same, or overlapping,\nexact locations. Hawthorne and Uzquiano apparently claim that the\nanswer is ‘Yes’. They write that \nparticles having integral spin—otherwise known as\nbosons—in modern particle physics … are generally thought\nto be point-sized. Moreover, according to the spin statistics theorem,\nwhile fermions—point-particles with half integer\nspin—cannot be colocated, bosons are perfectly well able to\ncohabit a single spacetime point. (2011: 3–4) \nSchaffer suggests otherwise: \n[a] more sophisticated treatment of these cases involves field theory.\nInstead of there being two bosons co-located at region r, there\nis a bosonic field with doubled intensity at r. (2009: 140) \nWhereas Hawthorne and Uzquiano apparently take bosons to provide\nactual examples of interpenetration, McDaniel suggests that\nthey at least reinforce the conceivability of such\ncounterexamples: \nwhat this example shows is that [disjoint] co-located material objects\nare not merely conceivable, but that a tremendously detailed\nconception of them has been formed: [disjoint] co-located objects play\na role in the interpretation of certain physical theories. It might be\nthat at the end of the day speculative physics will postulate\nco-located material objects. It seems to me that we should not\ndisregard this possibility a priori. (2007a: 240) \nIf one's goal, in constructing a theory of location, is to articulate\nthe necessary and a priori truths governing location and its\ninteraction with parthood, then even McDaniel's modest point still\ncounts against including No Interpenetration in one's theory. For if\nMcDaniel is right, then that principle is at best an a\nposteriori truth, though perhaps still a necessary truth. (See\nSimons (1994a, 2004a) for further discussion of bosons and for related\nconsiderations in support of interpenetration. For further discussion\nof Hawthorne and Uzquiano, see Cotnoir (2016).) \nSider (2000: 585–6), McDaniel (2007a), and Saucedo (2011) have\nall objected to No Interpenetration on the grounds that it conflicts\nwith plausible ‘principles of recombination’, which forbid\ncertain sorts of necessary connections between distinct properties and\nrelations. McDaniel's formulation of the objection, which is similar\nto Sider's, runs as follows: \nThe state of affairs in which [a simple] object x occupies a\nparticular region of space R (at t) is distinct from the\nstate of affairs in which [some other simple] object y occupies\nthe same region (at the same time). From the fact that the first state\nof affairs obtains, we can infer nothing about the location of\ny. Both states of affairs obtain contingently. If any\nrecombination of distinct, contingent states of affairs yields a\ngenuine possibility, as I am inclined to hold, then there are possible\nworlds at which both x and y occupy R (at\nt). (2007a: 241) \nLet o1 and o2 be two different\nobjects, let r be a region, and consider the following states\nof affairs: \nThen we can reconstruct McDaniel's argument as follows: \nIf it's possible for both s1 and\ns2 to obtain, then it's possible for a given region\nto be the exact location of two different simples. And since no two\nsimples can overlap, this would mean that it's possible for disjoint\nthings (the simples) to have identical (hence overlapping) exact\nlocations. \nIs the argument successful? As Sider and McDaniel are well aware, the\nterm ‘distinct from’ needs to mean something other than\n‘not identical to’, if the recombination principle,\nPremise 4, is to get off the ground. After all, the state of affairs\nof o's being 2 kg in mass and the state of affairs of\no's being 3 kg in mass are both contingent, and they\nare not identical to each other, but presumably it is not possible\nthat they both obtain. (Presumably it's not possible that\nsomething is both 2 kg and 3 kg in mass.) \nBut it is no easy matter to give ‘distinct from’ a meaning\nthat makes Premises 3 and 4 simultaneously plausible. If it means\n‘shares no parts or constituents with’, then Premise 4\navoids the counterexample given above, but Premise 3 ceases to be\nplausible, since s1 and s2 do\nplausibly share a constituent, namely r. If ‘s is\ndistinct from s*’ is defined as ‘(i) possibly,\ns obtains and s* does not, (ii) possibly, s does\nnot obtain and s does, (iii) possibly, neither s nor\ns* obtains, and (iv) possibly, both s and s*\nobtain’, then Premise 4 is trivially true, but Premise 3 begs\nthe question. \nFor additional arguments in favor of interpenetration, including a\nmore detailed recombination argument, see Section 1.1 of the\nsupplementary document\n Additional Arguments. \nSupersubstantivalism is often glossed as the view that each material\nobject is identical to the spacetime region at which the object is\nexactly\n located.[7]\n If supersubstantivalism is not just true but necessary, then it is\nimpossible for disjoint material objects to be exactly\nlocated at overlapping regions. After all, if material object x\nis exactly located at region r1 and material object\ny is exactly located at r2, and\nr1 and r2 overlap, then, given\nsupersubstantivalism, x=r1 and\ny=r2, and hence x and y overlap\nas well. \nThis gives us an argument for (2), the version of No Interpenetration\nrestricted to material objects. (However, (2) conflicts with the\npossibility of Sanford's interpenetrating blocks, so the argument will\nbe controversial.) But the argument does not give us an argument for\nNo Interpenetration. For it wouldn't follow that it is impossible for\nthere to be disjoint entities of any kind to have overlapping exact\nlocations. Supersubstantivalism, as stated above, leaves open the\npossibility that there are universals or tropes, e.g., that are\nexactly located at regions but not identical to them. Hence it leaves\nopen the possibility that disjoint entities that are not material\nobjects might have overlapping exact locations. \nTo construct an argument for No Interpenetration, we would need to\nappeal to a stronger supersubstantivalist doctrine, for example: \nSupersubstantivalism+ entails No Interpenetration. Take any objects\nx and y in any possible world, and suppose that they\nhave exact locations, r1 and r2\nrespectively, that overlap. Then, given Supersubstantivalism+,\nx=r1 and y=r2, hence\nx and y overlap. \nFor a second, related argument against interpenetration, see Section\n1.2 of the supplementary document\n Additional Arguments. \nA simple is an entity that has no proper parts. Are there any simples?\nWithin the realm of spatiotemporal entities, some natural candidates\nare: spacetime points, fundamental particles such as electrons (or\ninstantaneous temporal parts of them), and perhaps certain universals,\ncertain tropes, or certain sets. On the other hand, it would seem to\nbe an empirically open possibility that all spatiotemporal entities\nare gunky. \nSay that an entity is extended just in case it is a\nspatiotemporal entity and does not have the shape and size of a point.\nIn this sense of ‘extended’, a solid cube would count as\nextended, but, given natural assumptions, so would a fusion of two\npoint-particles that are one foot apart. Although such a fusion is\nnaturally taken to have zero length, it would be a scattered object\nand so would not have the shape of a point. \nAre there any extended simples? Could there be? Those who answer\n‘No’ to both questions will be inclined to accept \nStrictly speaking, NXS does not say that extended simples are\nimpossible; rather, it says that simples with complex exact locations\nare impossible. It leaves open the possibility that there are extended\nsimple regions and extended simple entities that are exactly located\nat them. (For more on extended simple regions and discrete space or\nspacetime, see Forrest 1995, Tognazzini 2006, Braddon-Mitchell and\nMiller 2006, McDaniel 2007, Dainton 2010: 294–301, Spencer 2010,\n2014, Hagar 2014, Jaeger 2014, and Kleinschmidt 2016.) And it rules\nout the possibility that there is a point-sized material simple that\nis exactly located at a point-sized but mereologically complex region\n(e.g., a region that is the fusion of several point-sized tropes each\nof which is at zero distance from each of the others). \nFor the most part, however, it will do no harm to treat the debate\nover extended simples as a debate over NXS. We can do so if we assume\nthat, necessarily, a region is extended if and only if it is complex.\nSo, in what follows, we will operate under that assumption unless we\nexplicitly note otherwise. \nAn initial argument appeals to the claim that extended simples are\nconceivable and takes that to be some evidence in favor of their\npossibility. To conceive of an extended simple, think of an\nextended—say, cubical—object that has no proper parts. The\nidea is not, or not merely, that the cube cannot be physically\nsplit or cut up. Whether or not it can be split is a separate\nquestion. The idea is that there are no proper parts of the cube.\nAlthough the object is cubical, it has no top half or bottom half, no\nleft half or right half. All there is, in the relevant vicinity, is\nthe cube itself—together with the region at which it is exactly\nlocated and the parts of that region. \nDebates about extended simples typically focus on the question of\nwhether extended simple material objects are possible. But entities in\nother ontological categories (tropes, universals, sets, regions) are\nsometimes thought to be located. So it is worth keeping in mind that,\nwhatever one thinks about material objects, one might hold that\nextended simples in other categories are possible. With that said, we\nwill focus on material objects for the remainder of this section. \nAs McDaniel (2007a: 235–6) notes, some physicists interpret\nstring theory as positing extended simples. McDaniel quotes a passage\nfrom Brian Greene: \nWhat are strings made of? There are two possible answers to this\nquestion. First, strings are truly fundamental—they are\n“atoms,” uncuttable constituents. … As the absolute\nsmallest constituents of anything and everything, they represent the\nend of the line … in the numerous layers of substructure in the\nmicroscopic world. From this perspective, even though strings have\nspatial extent, the question of their composition is without any\ncontent. Were strings to be made of something smaller they would not\nbe fundamental. Instead, whatever strings were composed of would\nimmediately displace them and lay claim to being an even more basic\nconstituent of the universe … [A] string is simply a\nstring—as there is nothing more fundamental, it can't be\ndescribed as being composed of any other substance. (1999:\n141–2) \nCan strings be treated as being identical to the spacetime regions at\nwhich they are exactly located? Greene does not explicitly address\nthis question. If the answer is ‘Yes’, however, and if\nstrings are exactly located only at complex regions, then string\ntheory would not be committed to extended simples after all. For an\nargument that string theory does not posit extended simples, see Baker\n(2016). \nAs we noted in\n Section 4.4,\n Sider, McDaniel, and Saucedo have argued for the possibility of\ninterpenetration by appeal to principles of recombination. They have\nalso marshaled these principles in support of the possibility of\nextended simples (Sider 2007; McDaniel 2007b; Saucedo 2011). Here is\nthe core of McDaniel's argument: \n(NNC): Let F and G be accidental, intrinsic properties;\nlet R be a fundamental relation; let x and y be\ncontingently existing non-overlapping entities. Then it is not the\ncase that, necessarily, Rxy only if\n(Fx if and only if Gy)…if we accept\nthe Humean premise that there are no necessary connections between the\naccidental, intrinsic properties of regions of space and the\naccidental, intrinsic properties of material objects, then we should\nhold that there are no necessary connections between the mereological\nstructure of a material object and the mereological structure of the\nregion it occupies. Specifically, it is not true that, necessarily, a\nmaterial object is a simple if and only if it occupies a simple (read:\npointsized) region of spacetime. It follows that extended material\nsimples are possible. (2007b: 135–137) \nIf we let o and r be contingently existing,\nnon-overlapping entities, then McDaniel's argument can be\nreconstructed as follows: \nSupersubstantivalists will deny that exact location is a fundamental\nrelation. Others might take aim at McDaniel's recombination principle.\nLet F be the property being round and let\nG be the property not being square. These may seem to\nbe accidental and intrinsic. But if they are, and if exact location is\nfundamental, then McDaniel's principle tells us that it is possible\nfor a round object to be exactly located at a square region, which\nsome might take as a reductio of (7). McDaniel (2007b) and\nSkow (2007), however, take this to show that the given shapes are not\nintrinsic properties. For a more detailed discussion of recombination\nprinciples such as (7), and a defense of the view that shapes are\nintrinsic, see Kleinschmidt (2015). \nFor further arguments in favor of extended simples, including a more\ndetailed recombination argument, see Section 2.1 of the supplementary\ndocument\n Additional Arguments. \nAccording to supersubstantivalism, each material object is identical\nto the spacetime region at which it is exactly located. Those who take\nsupersubstantivalism to be a necessary truth are likely to be hostile\nto the possibility of extended simples—or at least to the\npossibility of extended simple material objects. For they are likely\nto endorse the following argument: \nMost defenders of extended simples will resist this argument by\ndenying (9). They tend to think of material objects as being\nnon-identical to, and indeed mereologically disjoint from, the regions\nat which they are exactly located (Markosian 1998; McDaniel 2007b,\n2009; Parsons 2007; Saucedo 2011). A different option is to reject\n(10) in favor of the view that there are, or at least could be,\nextended simple spacetime regions (Braddon-Mitchell and Miller\n2006). \nThe above argument yields only a weak, restricted version of NXS, the\nban on extended simples. It leaves open the possibility of extended\nsimples that are not material objects. \nNXS does follow from Supersubstantivalism+, according to which it's a\nnecessary truth that each entity is identical to anything at which it\nis exactly located. For suppose that x is exactly located at\ny and that y is complex. Then, given\nSupersubstantivalism+, x=y, hence x is complex\ntoo. \nA second argument against extended simples arises from problems about\nsimples whose intrinsic properties vary across space or spacetime: \nThe argument is valid and (14) is clearly true. If x has a part\nthat instantiates F and a part that instantiates G,\nthen, provided that these properties are incompatible, the parts in\nquestion are not identical. So x has at least two parts. So at\nleast one of them must be a proper part of x, in which\ncase x is not simple. \nOne might resist the argument by denying (12) and saying that a simple\ncan be extended but only if it is qualitatively homogeneous across\nspacetime. (Spencer 2010 denies the possibility of heterogeneous\nextended simples. Jaeger 2014 responds; Spencer 2014 replies.) But\nmost friends of extended simples grant (12) and reject (13). This can\nbe done in at least four ways. \nThe relativizing approach says that if a simple, o, is white in\none region and grey in another, then o bears the being white at\nrelation to the first region and the being grey at relation to the\nsecond; it need not have a part that instantiates the property\nwhiteness or a part that instantiates the property greyness.\nAlternatively, one might treat instantiation as a three-place\nrelation, and say that o instantiates the property whiteness at\none region and instantiates the property greyness at another. \nBoth versions of this approach are based on theories of persistence\nand change that attempt to reconcile eternalism and the B-theory of\ntime with endurantism, the view that objects are wholly present at\nmultiple times and do not have temporal parts (for more on\nendurantism, see\n section 6.3).\n Accordingly, the standard criticisms of the relevant theories of\npersistence and change (on which see Haslanger 2003) would seem to\napply equally to the relativizing approach to the problem of\nqualitative variation for extended simples. The main criticism is\nthat, by appealing to relations to regions, the relativizing approach\nmakes an object's color distribution (or whatever) a dyadic relation\nor an extrinsic property, when it is in fact (says the critic) an\nintrinsic property, involving only the object, its parts, and the\nintrinsic properties of these things. \nMarkosian (1998, 2004a, 2015) distinguishes between things (e.g.,\nmaterial objects) and stuff (e.g., matter). Stuff, according to\nMarkosian, comes in portions, but no portion of stuff is a thing. Both\nthings and portions of stuff can have parts, but any part of a thing\nis itself a thing, and any part of a portion of stuff is itself a\nportion of stuff. Crucially, each thing is constituted by a\nportion of stuff. With this framework in place, Markosian offers the\nfollowing account. There can be extended simple things, but there\ncannot be extended simple portions of stuff. When an extended simple,\no, is white in region rw and grey in\nregion rg, this isn't because o itself\nhas a part that is exactly located at rw and\ninstantiates whiteness and another part that is exactly located at\nrg and instantiates greyness; rather, it's\nbecause the portion of stuff that constitutes o has such parts.\nThis preserves the simplicity of the extended thing. It may also avoid\nthe complaint, facing the relativizing approach, that it makes the\ncolor distribution of an extended simple an extrinsic matter. The\nrelation between a thing and the portion of stuff that constitutes it\nis apparently more intimate than the relation between a thing and the\nregion at which it is exactly located. Moreover, the stuff-theoretic\napproach, unlike the relativizing approach, holds that when an\nextended object is white in one region and grey in another, the\nmonadic, intrinsic properties whiteness and greyness (not merely the\ndyadic relations being white at and being\ngrey at) are both instantiated. However, some\nmay doubt that a complex entity could constitute a simple one. \nParsons (2000) proposes that if a simple is white in one region and\ngrey in another, then it has a fundamental, intrinsic,\ndistributional property. Some distributional properties, such\nas being black all over, are uniform.\nOthers, such as being polka-dotted are\nnon-uniform. When a simple has a non-uniform distributional\nproperty, this fact is not grounded in its having parts, configured in\na certain way, that each have simpler, uniform properties. Nor is it\ngrounded in the simple's standing in incompatible relations (being\nwhite at and being grey at)\nto different spacetime regions. Rather, it is an ungrounded fact about\nthe simple. This apparently avoids the worries about extrinsicness\nthat face the relativizing approach, and it makes no appeal to\nMarkosian's unorthodox notion of constitution. \nAs McDaniel (2009) notes, however, Parsons is apparently forced to\ntreat facts of the form x is F at r as\nunanalyzed and ungrounded, which one might take to be a drawback. In\nFigure 5, the objects o1 and o2\npresumably have the same maximally determinate distributional color\nproperty: roughly, being grey in one half and white in\nthe other. \nFigure 5 \nCall this property P. Further, object\no1 is grey at region r1g.\nWhat grounds this fact? Not the fact that o1 has\nP. After all, o2 also has P, but it is\nnot grey at r1g. Not the fact that\no1 has P and is exactly located at\nr1. For it is possible that there be a thing that\nhas P and is exactly located at r1g\nbut is not grey at r1g: this is the case,\ne.g., in the possible world that results from deleting\no1 and putting o2 in its place\n(without rotating it clockwise or counterclockwise). Thus, in addition\nto his basic distributional properties, Parsons is apparently forced\nto treat relations to regions (e.g., being grey\nat) as being basic as well. \nThe relativizing approach has no such problem: it treats relations to\nregions as basic and analyzes distributional properties in terms of\nthem. The stuff-theoretic approach avoids the problem too. It analyzes\nfacts of the form x is F at y as: either\nx or the portion of stuff that constitutes x has a part\nthat is exactly located at y and is F. \nMcDaniel (2009) attempts to avoid all the above problems by appeal to\na theory of tropes developed by Ehring (1997a,b). The idea is that a\nsimple can be grey in one region and white in another region by\ninstantiating a greyness trope that is exactly located at the first\nregion and instantiating a whiteness trope that is exactly located at\nthe second region. This permits an analysis of facts of the form\nx is F at y as x instantiates\nan F-ness trope that is exactly located at y; it\nmakes no appeal to stuff or portions of stuff; and, since it invokes\nmonadic color tropes, it (arguably) refrains from treating\nthe facts about a simple's color distribution as being fundamentally\nrelational and extrinsic. \nFor further arguments against extended simples, see Section 2.2 of the\nsupplementary document\n Additional Arguments. \nTo say that an object is multilocated is to say that it has more than\none exact location: ‘x is multilocated’ means\n‘∃y1∃y2[L(x,\ny1) & L(x, y2)\n& y1≠y2]’. We\nconsider a series of putative examples of multi-location in\n Section 6.3. \nThe debate over multilocation concerns \nOpponents of multilocation accept Functionality+. Friends of\nmultilocation typically want to affirm something stronger than the\nnegation of Functionality+. They typically accept the possibility of\nan entity that is exactly located at each of two regions that do not\neven overlap. \nEarlier we glossed ‘x is exactly located at\ny’ as ‘x has (or has-at-y) the same\nsize and shape as y, and stands (or stands-at-y) in all\nthe same spatiotemporal relations to things as does y’.\nThus spheres are exactly located only at spherical regions, cubes only\nat cubical regions, and so on. When an entity is said to be\nmultilocated, then, it is said to stand in this relation to each\nof several regions: informally put, it has the same size, shape,\nand position as region r1; it has the same size,\nshape, and position as region r2; and so on. No\nclaim is made to the effect that the object is exactly located at the\nfusion of r1, r2,\n…, or at any proper parts of any of these regions. \nTo clarify the idea of multilocation in an informal way, it may be\nuseful to consider Figure 6, inspired by Hudson (2005: 105) and\nKleinschmidt (2011: 256). \nA scattered, singly located\n\nobject \nA non-scattered, multilocated\n\nobject \nThe object o1 is scattered: its shape is that of the\nsum of two non-overlapping circles. It is not multilocated. Rather, it\nhas just one exact location: the scattered region\nr3. It is not exactly located at any proper part of\nthat region, such as r1 or r2. \nThe object o2 is multilocated. It has two (and only\ntwo) exact locations. It is exactly located at the circular region\nr3; and it is exactly located at the circular region\nr4, which does not overlap r3. It\nis not exactly located at their fusion, and it is not located at any\nof their proper parts. Since o2 is exactly located\nat r3, which is circular, o2 is\ncircular, at least at r3. For parallel\nreasons, o2 is circular at r4. By\ncontrast, o1 is not circular simpliciter,\nnor is it circular at any region. \nEverything we have said so far is neutral with respect to whether\neither of the material objects is simple. It may be that both objects\nare simple, or that both are complex, or that o1 is\nsimple and o2 is complex, or vice versa. This\nis worth emphasizing, since questions about the possibility of\nextended simples and questions about the possibility of multilocation\nare sometimes run together. \nIt is natural to think that if these two objects were visible, they\nwould be visually indistinguishable. Indeed, it is tempting to think\nthat there would be no empirical difference between\no1 and o2. For those with\nverificationist leanings, this may lead to the belief that there is no\ndifference at all between o1 and\no2 and hence that there must be something defective\nabout the initial set-up of the case. \nAs with interpenetration and extended simples, one might offer a\nconceivability argument for the possibility of multilocation. One\ncould claim that multilocation is conceivable and take this to be\nevidence that multilocation is possible. Since this argument does not\nappear to raise any issues that are specific to multilocation, we will\nmove on. \nIt is natural to think that the extant recombination arguments for\ninterpenetration and extended simples can be adapted to yield an\nargument for multilocation. If one slightly alters the passage (quoted\nin\n Section 4.4)\n in which McDaniel presents his recombination argument for\ninterpenetration (2007a: 241), one gets the following, parallel\nargument for multilocation: \nThe actual state of affairs in which an object x is exactly\nlocated at a particular region r is distinct from the merely\npossible state of affairs in which object x is exactly located\nat some other, disjoint region r*. From the fact that x\nis exactly located at r, we can infer nothing about what, if\nanything, is exactly located at r*. Both states of affairs are\ncontingent: they possibly obtain and possibly fail to obtain. If any\nrecombination of contingent states of affairs yields a genuine\npossibility, then there are possible worlds at which x is\nexactly located both at r and at r* and hence is\nmultilocated. \nThis argument appears to have the same virtues and vices as McDaniel's\noriginal argument for interpenetration. \n(Some recombination arguments for interpenetration and extended\nsimples cannot be adapted to yield an argument for multilocation. See\nSection 3.2 of the supplemetary document\n Additional Arguments.) \nA third kind of argument for the possibility of multilocation simply\npoints to examples. Entities that have been taken to be multilocated\ninclude: immanent universals, enduring material objects, enduring\ntropes, four-dimensional perduring objects, backward time travelers,\nfission products, transworld individuals, works of music, and an\nomnipresent God. \nAs we have noted, immanent realists say that universals are\nspatiotemporal entities that are in some sense ‘wholly\npresent’ in the things that instantiate them. This seems to be\nthe view under discussion in the following passage from Plato's\nParmenides, 131a–131b (in Hamilton and Cairns 1961:\n925): \nOne natural way to translate immanent realism into the terminology of\nexact location is via the following principle: \nTo see how this leads to multilocation, suppose that some monadic\nuniversal u is instantiated by an entity e1\nthat is exactly located at region r1 and by a\ndifferent entity, e2, that is exactly located at\nregion r2, disjoint from r1. Then,\ngiven (16), u itself is exactly located both at\nr1 and at r2 (Paul 2006; Lafrance\n2015). \n(16) is not inevitable, even for immanent realists. Some of them might\nprefer to say that a monadic universal is exactly located only at the\nfusion of the exact locations of its instances (Bigelow,\n1988: 18–27, can in places be read as embracing this, and\nEffingham 2015 argues that this is what immanent realists should say).\nOn this view, a simple monadic universal might be scattered but would\nnot be multilocated. Others (Armstrong 1989: 99) prefer to say that\nuniversals do not have exact locations at all, though they are parts\nor constituents of things that have exact locations or of spacetime\nitself. This was dubbed the ‘Burying Strategy’ in\n Section 4.1.[9] \nThe debate over persistence through time centers around two rival\nviews, endurantism and perdurantism. Endurantists often say that a\npersisting material object is temporally unextended and in some sense\n‘wholly present’ at each instant of its career.\nPerdurantists often say that a persisting material object is a\ntemporally extended entity that has a different temporal part at each\ndifferent instant of its career and is at most partially present at\nany one instant. \n(Informally, an instantaneous temporal part of me is an object that is\na part of me, is made of the exactly same matter as I am whenever it\nexists, and has exactly the same spatial location as I do whenever it\nexists, but exists at only a single\n instant.[10]) \nRecently, a number of philosophers have suggested that the traditional\nendurantism versus perdurantism dispute runs together a pair of\nindependent disputes about persistence: a mereological dispute\nconcerning the existence of temporal parts, and a locational dispute\nconcerning exact locations (Gilmore 2006, 2008; Hawthorne 2006; Sattig\n2006; Donnelly 2010, 2011b; Eddon 2010; Rychter 2011; Calosi and Fano\n2015). Stated somewhat loosely, the mereological dispute is between\nthe following views: \nTo frame the locational dispute, it will be useful to have one further\npiece of terminology. Say that y is a path of x\nif and only if y is a fusion of the exact locations of x\n(Gilmore 2006: 204). Informally, a path of an object is a region at\nwhich the object's complete career is exactly located. \nWe can then state the locational dispute as follows: \nPhilosophers on both sides of this dispute can agree about which\nspacetime regions are the paths of which material objects. They will\ndisagree about which spacetime regions are the exact locations of\nwhich objects. The locational perdurantist will say that material\nobjects are exactly located only at their paths. The locational\nendurantist will say that a persisting material object is exactly\nlocated at many regions, each of them a slice of its path. The\ninteraction between the two disputes about persistence is summarized\nin Figure 7 (from Gilmore 2008: 1230). \nLocational endurance entails multilocation: it says that some material\nobjects are exactly located at many different regions. Mereological\nendurance, which merely rejects temporal parts, does not entail\nmultilocation. Thus one might reject temporal parts while retaining\nFunctionality. This is the position of Parsons (2000, 2007). It\ncorresponds to the lower left-hand box in Figure\n 7.[11] \nWhether or not one takes material objects to be multilocated in the\nmanner of locational endurantism, one might hold such a view about\ntropes. Ehring (1997b, 2011) defends the view that tropes endure,\nthough he does not say whether he takes them to be multilocated in our\nsense. Consider some simple, spatially unextended trope e, and\nsuppose that it persists. Let the temporally extended, one-dimensional\nspacetime region r be e's path. Then there are at least\ntwo natural things one could say regarding e's locations. One\ncould say that (i) e has just one exact location, r, in\nwhich case e is a temporally extended simple but not\nmultilocated. Alternatively, one could say (ii) e is exactly\nlocated at each point in r and nowhere else, in which case\ne is multilocated but not extended. \nHudson (2001) defends a version of mereological perdurantism according\nto which each ordinary material object is exactly located at a great\nmany (mostly overlapping) four-dimensional spacetime regions. Hudson\noffers his view as a solution to\n the problem of the many\n among other things. \n(Hudson also argues that, given his view, the fundamental parthood\nrelation should be taken to be a three-place relation holding between\ntwo objects and a region. See Gilmore (2009) and Donnelly (2010) for\ndiscussion.) \nSuppose that Suzy is born at time t0 and dies 90\nyears later, at time t90. At time\nt40, the forty-year-old Suzy steps into a time\nmachine and disappears, reappearing (with her time machine) out of\nthin air many years earlier. Suzy then enters the nursery in the house\nwhere she was raised and, at t1, sees a one-year-old\nbaby, whom she knows to be herself. (The character Suzy originates in\nVihvelin 1996.) \nIf one is an endurantist, one will find it natural to describe this\nsituation as involving multi-location in space or spacetime: Suzy is\nexactly located at rA, a region with the size\nand shape of an adult; Baby Suzy is exactly located at\nrB, a disjoint but simultaneous region with\nthe size and shape of a baby; and Suzy=Baby Suzy. Hence there is a\nsingle thing (namely, Suzy/Baby Suzy) that is exactly located at two\ndifferent, simultaneous regions, rA and\nrB (MacBride 1998, Keller and Nelson 2001;\nGilmore 2003, 2006, 2007; Miller 2006; Carroll 2011; Kleinschmidt\n2011; Effingham 2015). All of this holds even if one rejects talk of\nregions of spacetime in favor of talk of regions of space. \nTo be sure, even endurantists can deny that the situation involves\nmultilocation. Those who accept mereological endurantism and\nlocational perdurantism will say that Suzy does not have temporal\nparts but is still four-dimensional in at least the following sense:\nshe is exactly located at only one region: her four-dimensional path\n(Parsons 2000, 2007, 2008). If one is a presentist—one who says\nthat only the present time and its contents exist—one might say\nthat, at t1, Suzy is exactly located only at a\nfusion of rA and rB,\nnot at either of those regions themselves (Markosian 2004c). \nHowever, if Suzy is exactly located only at the sum of\nrA and rB at\nt1 then she is not shaped like a human being at\nt1; rather, she is a scattered object shaped like\nthe sum of two human beings. It might seem doubtful that Suzy can\nexist at a time without being even approximately human-shaped at that\ntime. This would speak in favor of the view that Suzy is multilocated,\nrather than scattered, at\n t1.[12] \nDainton (2008: 364–408) argues that if a person were to undergo\nfission (in roughly the manner of an amoeba), the person would\ncontinue to exist after the fission in bilocated form: she would be\nwholly present in two different places at once. (This view is also\ndiscussed by Johnston 1989). Dainton's view is naturally understood as\ninvolving multilocation, either in spacetime or in space at a time:\nafter the fission, the person is exactly located at two different\nregions (see Gilmore, 2008: 1246, for an objection to Dainton's\nview). \nMcDaniel (2004) develops a version of concrete modal realism that\nposits multilocation; he dubs the view Modal Realism with\nOverlap (MRO). Like Lewis's (1986) modal realism, MRO treats\npossible worlds as concrete, spatiotemporal entities and holds that\nspacetime regions are ‘worldbound’: no spacetime region\nthat is part of one world overlaps any spacetime region that is part\nof another world. Unlike Lewis's view, however, MRO claims that\nmaterial objects are wholly present in more than one world.\nSpecifically, MRO entails multilocation. It says that if Lewis is a\nphilosopher in world w1 and a plumber but not a\nphilosopher in world w2, then he is exactly located\nat two or more regions (one of which is a part of w1\nand another of which is a part of w2). \nTillman (2011) develops a view about the ontology of musical works\naccording to which Beethoven's 9th Symphony (the\nsymphony itself, as opposed to any particular performance of it) is\nmultilocated. The view has it that a work of music is exactly located\nat a spacetime region r if and only if some performance of that\nwork is exactly located at r. When combined with facts about\nthe relevant performances, this principle yields the result that\nBeethoven's 9th is exactly located at spacetime regions\nconfined to the 19th century Vienna and also at other\nregions confined to 20th century New York; it is\nmultilocated. Tillman argues that this view is preferable to other\nforms of ‘musical materialism’. He does not say whether it\nis preferable to the view that works of music are abstract objects\nwith no spatiotemporal location. \nOn some interpretations, the doctrine of divine\n omnipresence\n entails that God is exactly located at each region of space or\nspacetime (Hudson 2009, Inman 2017). The relevance of multilocation to\nissues in Christian theology, including the real presence of Christ in\nthe eucharist and the resurrection of the dead, is discussed in Pruss\n(2009, 2013), Hudson (2010, 2014), Baber (2013), Effingham (2015), and\nPickup (2015). \nFor an additional argument in favor of multilocation, see Section 3.1\nof the supplementary document\n Additional Arguments. \nAs we noted in\n Section 2,\n if one defines ‘x is exactly located at y’\nas ‘x is weakly located at all and only those entities\nthat overlap y’—as Parsons (2007) claims that we\nare free to do—then one can argue as follows: \nTo see that the inference from (17) to (18) is valid, suppose that\nobject o is exactly located at regions\nra and rb. Since\no is exactly located at ra, o\nis (by (17)) weakly located at all and only the entities that overlap\nra. Likewise, since o is exactly\nlocated at rb, o is weakly located at\nall and only the entities that overlap rb. So\nra overlaps a given entity if and only if\no is weakly located at that entity; and\nrb overlaps a given entity if and only if\no is weakly located at that entity. Hence\nra and rb overlap\nexactly the same entities: in other words, they mereologically\ncoincide. The rest of the argument is self-explanatory. \nThe argument may persuade some. However, those who are initially\ninclined to take the possibility of multilocation seriously may see\nthis argument as a reason to doubt the first premise and the\nassociated definition (Gilmore 2006: 203; Effingham 2015). (A parallel\nargument runs through an alternative definition: ‘x is\nexactly located at y’ means ‘for any z, if\nz is simple, then z lies within x if and only if\nz is a part of y’. As we noted in\n Section 2,\n this definition has the additional vice that in the context of gunky\nspacetime, it yields the result that everything is exactly located at\nevery region.) \nWhen taken to be a necessary truth, supersubstantivalism yields\narguments against the possibility of interpenetrating material objects\nand extended simple material objects. Given the symmetry and\ntransitivity of identity, it also yields an argument against the\npossibility of multilocated material objects. Since, necessarily, a\nmaterial object is identical to each of its exact locations, and since\nnothing can be identical to two different entities, no material object\ncan have two different exact locations. \nThis leaves open the possibility of multilocation for entities (e.g.,\nuniversals) that are not material objects. This possibility is ruled\nout by Supersubstantivalism+, according to which it is necessary that\nany entity is identical to anything at which it is exactly\nlocated. \nExtended simples face a problem arising from qualitative variation.\nMultilocated entities face a similar problem. One might think that if\nmultilocation is possible, then there should be a possible situation\ninvolving a thing o1 exactly located at a region\nr1 and a thing o2 exactly located\nat a disjoint region r2, such that\no1 is white, o2 is grey, and\no1=o2. (Again, change in color is\njust a placeholder.) Since it's impossible for a single thing to be\nboth white and grey, one might continue, no such situation is\npossible. This might lead one to conclude that multilocation itself is\nimpossible. \nFriends of multilocation reject the initial (conditional) premise,\nthough not always for the same reason. Some say that multilocation is\npossible but only for entities, such as universals or tropes, that do\nnot vary qualitatively between locations. Others say that\nmultilocation is possible even for entities that do vary between\nlocations. These philosophers can choose among the roughly same range\nof options that were available to friends of heterogeneous extended\nsimples, including the relativizing approach, the stuff-theoretic\napproach, and distributional\n properties.[13] \nFor further arguments against multilocation, see Section 3.3 of the\nsupplementary document\n Additional Arguments. \nWe conclude by listing some important questions about which we have so\nfar said little:","contact.mail":"csgilmore@ucdavis.edu","contact.domain":"ucdavis.edu"}]
