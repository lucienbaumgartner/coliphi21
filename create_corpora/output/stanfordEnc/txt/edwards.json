His\nwork as a whole is an expression of two themes — the absolute\nsovereignty of God and the beauty of God's holiness. The first is\narticulated in Edwards' defense of theological determinism, in a\ndoctrine of occasionalism, and in his insistence that physical objects\nare only collections of sensible “ideas” while finite\nminds are mere assemblages of “thoughts” or\n“perceptions.” As the only real cause or substance\nunderlying physical and mental phenomena, God is “being in\ngeneral,” the “sum of all being.”\n\n\nEdwards' second theme is articulated in accounts of God's end in\ncreation, and of the nature of true virtue and true beauty. God\ncreates in order to manifest a holiness which consists in a\nbenevolence which alone is truly beautiful. Genuine human virtue is an\nimitation of divine benevolence and all finite beauty is an image of\ndivine loveliness. True virtue is needed to discern this beauty,\nhowever, and to reason rightly about “divine things.”\n\n\nEdwards' projected History of Redemption would have drawn\nthese themes together, for it is in his redemptive work in history\nthat God's sovereignty, holiness, and beauty are most clearly\nexhibited.\n\nEdwards was born into a family of prominent Congregational ministers\nin East Windsor, Connecticut in 1703. In 1716 Edwards enrolled in Yale\nwhere he read Newton and Locke, and began “Notes on the\nMind” and “Notes on Natural Science.” Locke's\ninfluence on his epistemology, philosophy of language, and\nphilosophical psychology was profound. Edwards' metaphysics, however,\nappears more strongly influenced by Malebranche and, to a lesser\nextent, the Cambridge Platonists, and bears little resemblance to\nLocke's. After briefly serving congregations in New York and Bolton,\nConnecticut, Edwards returned to Yale where he completed his Masters\nof Arts degree and became senior tutor in 1724. In 1725, the church in\nNorthampton chose Edwards to succeed his grandfather, Solomon Stoddard\n— the so-called “pope of the Connecticut valley.”\nThe most notable events of his tenure were the revivals of 1734 and\n1740–41, the latter of which came to be known as the Great\nAwakening. Edwards' defense of the revivals and criticisms of its\nexcesses culminated in his first major treatise, the\nReligious Affections (1746). Worsening relations\nwith his congregation came to a head in a dispute over qualifications\nfor church membership. Rejecting the less rigorous standards of his\ngrandfather, Edwards insisted on a public profession of saving faith\nbased on the candidate's religious experiences as a qualification not\nonly for Holy Communion but also for church membership. He was\ndismissed in 1750 by a margin of one vote. After refusing invitations\nto pulpits in North America and Scotland, Edwards retreated to the\nIndian mission at Stockbridge where he had charge of two difficult\ncongregations, supervised a boarding school for Indian boys, and\ncompleted his last major works — Freedom of the Will\n(1754), Original Sin (1758), End of Creation, and\nTrue Virtue (both published posthumously in 1765). Edwards\naccepted an appointment as President of the College of New Jersey (now\nPrinceton) in 1757. He died from complications arising from a smallpox\ninoculation on March 22, 1758, less than five weeks after his\ninauguration. Edwards' published works were primarily designed to\ndefend the Puritan version of Calvinist orthodoxy and his influence on\nCongregational and Presbyterian theology was profound. His extensive\nnotebooks reveal an interest in philosophical problems for their own\nsake, however, and his deployment of philosophical arguments in his\nprivate papers and published works are both sophisticated and\nfrequently original. \nEdwards believed that indeterminism is incompatible with our\ndependence on God and hence with his sovereignty. If our responses to\nGod's grace are contra-causally free, then our salvation depends\npartly on us and God's sovereignty isn't “absolute and\nuniversal.” Freedom of the Will defends theological\ndeterminism. Edwards begins by attempting to show that libertarianism\nis incoherent. For example, he argues that by\n‘self-determination’ the libertarian must mean either that\none's actions including one's acts of willing are preceded by an act\nof free will or that one's acts of will lack sufficient causes. The\nfirst leads to an infinite regress while the second implies that acts\nof will happen accidentally and hence can't make someone “better\nor worse, any more than a tree is better than other trees because it\noftener happens to be lit upon by a swan or nightingale; or a rock\nmore vicious than other rocks, because rattlesnakes have happened\noftener to crawl over it” (Freedom of the Will, 1754;\nEdwards 1957–, vol. 1, 327). On the second alternative, acts of\nchoosing (volitions) are neither chosen by us nor determined by\nreasons or our character or by other states of the soul. But if they\nare not, then they aren't truly ours and we cannot be held responsible\nfor them. Edwards also argues that libertarianism is inconsistent with\nordinary moral concepts. If, for example, the necessity of sinning\nwholly excuses, then a bias to sin should partially excuse. But it\ndoesn't; a person who acts from settled habits of maliciousness is\ndeemed “so much the more worthy to be detested and\ncondemned” (Freedom of the Will, 1754; Edwards\n1957–, vol. 1, 360). Since libertarianism implies that necessity\nexcuses, it is inconsistent with the way we attribute blame. \nIn Edwards' opinion, libertarianism's specious aura of plausibility is\ngrounded in a systematic confusion of “philosophical” and\n“vulgar” (ordinary) usage. For example, in ordinary usage\nsomething (e.g., remaining seated) is said to be “necessary to\nus…when we can't help it, let us do what we will”\n(Freedom of the Will, 1754; Edwards 1957–, vol. 1,\n150). Causal necessity doesn't entail “vulgar necessity,”\nhowever. Ingrained habits, deeply felt resentment, and the like may\ncausally necessitate a malicious action. It doesn't follow that the\nagent wouldn't have refrained from acting maliciously if she had\nchosen not to act maliciously. Hence, the fact that she was causally\nunable to act other than she did does not imply that she was unable to\ndo so in the “vulgar” or ordinary sense. Libertarians are\ntherefore mistaken in thinking that because vulgar necessity excuses,\nso does causal necessity. Again, ‘freedom’ or\n‘liberty’ in common speech refer only to “that power\nand opportunity for one to do and conduct as he will, or according to\nhis choice,” and contains no reference to the “cause or\noriginal” of the act of will (Freedom of the Will,\n1754; Edwards 1957–vol. 1, 163–64). Hence, that liberty in\nthe ordinary sense is essential to moral agency does not entail that\ncontra-causal freedom is. It is also important to note that action in\nthe ordinary sense is “some motion or exertion of power, that is\nvoluntary, or that is the effect of the will…[the term\nis] most commonly used to signify outward actions” (Freedom\nof the Will, 1754; Edwards 1957–, vol. 1, 346). Improperly\nextending the term ‘action’ to movements of the will has\nled some libertarians to conclude that since external behavior must be\npreceded by an act of will to be voluntary, and an appropriate object\nof moral appraisal, so too must acts of will. A consequence is the\nlibertarian's misleading talk of the will's self-determination. \nEdwards' principle reasons for theological determinism are\nGod's sovereignty, the principle of sufficient reason (which requires\nthat everything that begins to be have a complete cause), the nature\nof motivation, and God's foreknowledge. The latter two are discussed\nat length. \nThe argument from motivation depends upon Edwards' identification of\nwilling or choosing with one's strongest inclination or preference.\nSince choosing just is a prevailing inclination, it is\nlogically impossible to choose in the absence of a prevailing motive.\nIf there is a prevailing motive, however, then the will is necessarily\ndetermined by it, for if the will were to choose contrary to a\nprevailing motive, the agent would have two opposed preponderant\ninclinations at the same time. All choices, therefore, are necessarily\ndetermined. \nEdwards' most impressive arguments from divine foreknowledge are based\non the impossibility of knowing future contingents and on the\nnecessity of the past. One knows p only if one has evidence for it,\nand evidence “must be one of…two sorts, either\nself-evidence or proof.” Propositions about\nfuture contingents can't be self-evident, however, because the states\nof affairs they represent are neither present to the mind nor\nnecessary. But they can't be proved either, for if the state of\naffairs expressed by the proposition is genuinely contingent,\n“there is nothing now existent with which the future existence\nof the contingent event is [necessarily] connected.” Future\ncontingents are thus necessarily unknowable (Freedom of the\nWill, 1754; Edwards 1957–, vol. 1, 259). Since God's\nknowledge of the future is comprehensive, it follows that no future\nevent (and so no future human action) is genuinely contingent. \nThe conclusion also follows from the necessity of the past. Suppose I\nmake a decision D at time t. Since God is\nomniscient, he has always believed that D occurs at\nt. Since he can't be mistaken, God's believing at some\nearlier time tn that D occurs at\nt entails that D occurs at t. But God's\nforebelief is past in relation to t and is therefore\n“now necessary” in the sense that nothing done at\nt can alter it. What is entailed by a necessary fact is\nitself necessary, however. Therefore, D could not fail to\noccur at t. Nor can one evade this conclusion by appealing to\nGod's timelessness as some do. For even if God's\n‘forebeliefs’ are timeless and so don't precede the events\nthey are about, divinely inspired prophecies are not. Yet divinely\ninspired prophecies, too, are necessarily connected with the human\nactions they foretell and they are clearly past (and hence necessary)\nin relation to them. \nNecessity is consistent with moral responsibility, however. We are\nsaid to be responsible for our actions when we act as we choose and\ndeterminism does not deny that our actions often spring from our\nchoices. Nor is necessity incompatible with praise and blame. Even\nthough God and Christ necessarily act for the best, their actions are\neminently praiseworthy. \nIt is worth noting that the aim of Edwards' philosophically\nsophisticated arguments is theological. He saw that  \nEdwards recognizes that “modern divines” pretend that\ndoctrines like these undermine “the very foundation of all\nreligion and morality” (Freedom of the Will, 1754;\nEdwards 1957, vol. 1, 422). Freedom of the Will concludes by\narguing that, on the contrary, they do a much better job of supporting\nthem. \nEdwards' occasionalism, idealism, and mental phenomenalism provide a\nphilosophical interpretation of God's absolute sovereignty: God is the\nonly real cause and the only true substance. \nEdwards implicitly distinguishes between a real or true cause and a\ncause in the ordinary or “vulgar” sense. The latter is\n“that, after or upon the existence of which, or the existence of\nit after such a manner, the existence of another thing follows”\n(“The Mind,” no. 26; Edwards 1957–, vol. 6, 350).\nVulgar causes aren't real causes, however. In the first place,\nso-called second causes are spatially or temporally distinct from\ntheir effects, and “no [real] cause can produce effects in a\ntime and place on which itself is not” (Original Sin,\n1758; Edwards 1957–, vol. 3, 400). In the second, real causes\nnecessitate their effects and second causes do not. “It don't at\nall necessarily follow,” for example, “that because there\nwas…color, or resistance,…or thought, or any other\ndependent thing at the last moment, that therefore there shall be the\nlike at the next” (Original Sin, 1758; Edwards\n1957–, vol. 3, 404). Finally, if second causes were real causes\nthey would be sufficient to produce their effects. If they were\nsufficient, however, then God's activity would be redundant and it is\nnot. Unlike second causes, God's causal activity meets all three\nconditions. Since God is not in time or space, there is no temporal or\nspatial separation between his activity and its effects. Since God is\nessentially omnipotent, his will is necessarily effective; it is\nlogically impossible for him to will s and s not take place. The third\ncondition is also met. Because God is omnipotent he doesn't need the\ncooperation of other causal powers to produce his effects. And because\nsovereignty belongs to him alone he doesn't share his causal power\nwith others. God's decrees are thus fully sufficient for their\neffects. God alone, then, is the only real cause. Vulgar causes (e.g.,\nheating water) are simply the occasions upon which God produces\neffects (e.g., the water's boiling) according to “methods and\nlaws” which express his customary manner of acting. \nIn an early paper (“Of Atoms”) Edwards pointed out that\nthe concept of a material substance is the concept of something\nsubsisting by itself, standing “underneath,” and keeping\n“up solidity and all other [physical] properties” (Edwards\n1957–, vol. 6, 215). He then argued that God alone meets these\nconditions, and concluded that if the concept of material substance\nrefers to anything, it refers to God's causal activity. \nEdwards also thought that “nothing has existence any where\nelse…but either in created or uncreated consciousness.”\nIt follows that “the material universe exists only in the\nmind;” “the existence of all corporeal things is only\nideas” (“Of Being,” “The Mind,” no. 51,\nand “Miscellanies,” no. 179; Edwards 1957, vol. 6, 204,\n368, and vol. 13, 327). \nEdwards' arguments for idealism are similar to (but apparently\nuninfluenced by) Berkeley's. One of the best examples occurs in\n“The Mind,” no. 27. Edwards first argues that the idea of\na body can be resolved into ideas of color and resistance. Figure, for\nexample, is the termination of color or resistance. Solidity\nis resistance, while motion is “the communication of\nthis resistance from space to space.” “Every knowing\nphilosopher” agrees that colors exist only in minds.\n‘Resistance’ refers either to instances in which one body\nresists another or to a power, namely, a body's disposition to resist\nother bodies. The first is a mode or property of ideas; it is ideas\nwhich are “resisted…move and stop, and rebound.”\nFor example, our observation of a billiard ball's ricocheting from the\ncushion can be resolved into impressions of a particular configuration\nof color and figure (the billiard ball) moving closer to another (the\ncushion), touching it, and then moving away from it. The power of\nresistance is no more than a divine “establishment,”\nnamely, “the constant law or method” of “the actual\nexertion of God's power” producing instances of resistance. So\ninstances of resistance are qualities of ideas and the\npower of resistance is a stable divine intention to act in\ncertain ways. Resistance, therefore, exists only in relation to minds.\nSince the idea of a body can be reduced to ideas of color and\nresistance, and color and resistance have only mental existence,\n“the world is…an ideal one” (Edwards 1957–,\nvol. 6, 350–51). \nEdwards' mental phenomenalism is a natural extension of his\noccasionalism and views on substance. If God is the only real cause of\nspatio-temporal phenomena, he is the only real cause of\n“thoughts” or “perceptions.” If a substance is\nwhat “subsists by itself,” “stands\nunderneath,” and “keeps up” a set of properties,\nthen a mental substance can only be what subsists by itself, stands\nunderneath, and keeps up mental properties. It follows that the\nconcept of mental substance either denotes nothing or refers to God's\ncausal activity. “What we call spirit,” then, “is\nnothing but a composition and series of perceptions [mental\nevents]…connected by…laws” (“Notes on\nKnowledge and Existence”; Edwards 1957–, vol. 6, 398). \nMental and physical substance are thus identical with God's causal\nproduction of the mental events constituting minds and the sensible\nideas or “sensations” which constitute bodies\n“according to…methods and laws” which he has\nfreely established (“The Mind,” no. 13; Edwards\n1957–, vol. 6, 344). God is thus the only true substance as well\nas the only true cause. \nGod's sovereignty also extends to criteria of identity.\n“Species” (kinds or natures) are the ways we classify\nthings. But our classifications depend on our needs and interests, and\nthe character of the world we live in. Hence, in determining every\nfeature of the spatio-temporal world, God has determined how things\nwill be classified, that is, what counts as a “species” or\nkind. Since a thing's criteria of identity are determined by its\nnature or kind, God is their ultimate ground. In short, laws determine\nkinds and kinds determine criteria of identity. In determining laws\nGod has therefore determined criteria of identity (“The\nMind”, nos. 41, 43, and 47; Edwards 1957, vol. 6, 359f, 361f.,\n366f.). (One implication is that God can so arrange things that Adam\nand his posterity count as one thing for purposes of punishment and\nreward.) \nGod is “being in general.” He “is the sum of all\nbeing, and there is no being without his being; all things are in him\nand he in all” (“Miscellanies,” no. 880; Edwards\n1957–, vol. 20, 122). Edwards appears to have borrowed the\nphrase “being in general” from Malebranche. What does he\nmean by it? \nHe does not mean that God is the power of being or being as such as\nearlier commentators like Clyde Holbrook and Douglas Elwood have\nsuggested. God is neither a power nor a universal but a concrete\nentity or substance — a necessarily existing “intelligent\nwilling agent such as our souls, only without our imperfections, and\nnot some inconceivable, unintelligent, necessary agent”\n(“Miscellanies,” no. 383; Edwards 1957–, vol. 13,\n452). \nTrue Virtue associates being with capacity or power, and\nasserts that “degree of existence” is a function of\n“greater capacity or power,” of having “every\nfaculty and every positive quality in an higher degree. An\narchangel must be supposed to have more existence, and to be\nevery way further removed from nonentity than a worm\nor a flea” (True Virtue, 1765; Edwards\n1957–, vol. 8, 546). Miscellany 94 identifies perfect entity and\nperfect activity: \n“The Discourse on the Trinity” claims that there is no\ndistinction between substance and act in the divine essence because\nGod’s essence is both “wholly substance and wholly\nact” (Edwards 1957, vol. 21, 116). And “The Mind”\nno. 45 identifies being with consciousness. “Perceiving being\nonly is properly being” (Edwards 1957–, vol. 6,\n363). Although Edwards never systematically developed or integrated\nthese scattered observations, their drift is toward the identification\nof being with mind in act, and of degree of being with degree of mind\nor consciousness and the comparative perfection of the activity in\nwhich it is engaged. God's consciousness and power are unlimited, and\nhis activity is perfect. His being is therefore unlimited. \nWhy, though, is God being in general? Because finite beings are\nabsolutely and immediately dependent upon him for both their being and\nproperties. Indeed, as the only true substance and only true cause,\ncreated beings are no more than God's “shadows” or\n“images.” (While “particular minds” deliberate\nand choose, and so possess a kind of agency, they lack real power and\nare thus no more than images of divine agency. Because they lack not\nonly power but also consciousness and will, bodies are even further\nremoved from real agency and hence are, as Edwards says, mere shadows\nof being.) As the only true substance and only true cause, God is the\n“head” of the system of beings, its “chief\npart,” an absolute sovereign whose power and perfection are so\ngreat that “all other beings are as nothing to him, and all\nother excellency…as nothing and less than nothing,…in\ncomparison of his” (End of Creation, 1765; Edwards\n1957–, vol. 8, 451). “The whole system of created beings\nin comparison of him is as the light dust of the balance”\n(“Miscellanies,” no. 1208; Edwards 1957–, vol. 23,\n133). ‘Being in general,’ then, refers to the system of\nbeings — primarily to God but to “particular\nbeings,” too, in so far as they depend upon and more or less\nadequately reflect him. \nThe claim that God is the only real substance, the “proper\nentity” of things, has led to accusations of pantheism. Students\nof Edwards have responded by insisting on a distinction in Edwards\nbetween God and creatures. The distinction is real but insufficient to\nrefute charges of pantheism. For, historically, pantheisms do not\nidentify the divine with nature as such but, rather, with nature's\nsubstance or essence or inner being or power. Natural phenomena aren't\nidentical with the divine. They are its modes or properties or parts.\nEdwards clearly believes that God is the world's real substance.\nHowever, the sense of his assertion is very different from that of the\npantheists. In claiming that God is the world's substance Edwards\nmeans that God's decrees are the only cause of an entity's being and\ncharacteristics. He isn't a pantheist because the relation between God\nand the world is construed as a relation between a creative volition\nand its immediate effects. Edwards' model is not a whole and its\nparts, or a substance (a bearer of properties) and its properties, or\nan essence and its accidents, but agent causality. \nEdwards never doubted that God's end is himself. Since true virtue\nconsists in benevolence to being and “complacence” or\ndelight in moral excellence, and since God is the “chief\npart” of being and the fount of all excellence, a truly virtuous\nagent “must necessarily have a supreme love to God, both of\nbenevolence and complacence” (True Virtue, 1765;\nEdwards 1957–, vol. 8, 551). It follows that God's\nrectitude and holiness “chiefly consists in a respect or regard\nto himself, infinitely above his regard to all other beings” and\nthat, as a consequence, his works must be “so wrought as to show\nthis supreme respect to himself” (End of Creation,\n1765; Edwards 1957–, vol. 8, 422). God's ultimate aim in all his\nworks must therefore be himself. Edwards concludes that he creates the\nworld for his own glory. But Edwards also believed that because the\nessence of goodness is to communicate good for it own sake,\n“happiness is the end of the creation”\n(“Miscellanies,” no. 3; Edwards 1957–, vol. 13,\n199). \nEnd of Creation reconciles these claims. God's glory is\ndefined as “the emanation and true external expression of God's\ninternal glory and fullness.” It includes (1) “the\nexercise of God's perfections to produce a proper effect,” (2)\n“the manifestation of his internal glory to created\nunderstandings,” (3) “the communication of the infinite\nfullness of God to the creature,” and (4) “the creature's\nhigh esteem of God, love to God, and complacence and joy in God; and\nthe proper exercises and expressions of these” (End of\nCreation, 1765; Edwards 1957–, vol. 8, 527). \nThere is no ontological distinction between the first and third\n“parts” of God's glory since the principal effect of God's\nexercising his perfections is “his fullness communicated.”\nFurthermore, the third part includes the second and fourth. For God's\ninternal fullness or glory is the “fullness of his understanding\nconsisting in his knowledge” of himself “and the fullness\nof his will consisting in his virtue and happiness.” His\n“external glory…consists in the communication of\nthese,” i. e., in bringing it about that “particular\nminds” know and love God, and delight in him. The four\n“parts” are thus “one thing, in a variety of views\nand relations” (End of Creation, 1765; Edwards\n1957–, vol. 8, 527). \nIn pursuing his own glory, God thus takes both himself and\nthe creature's good as ultimate aims. Happiness consists in the\nknowledge and love of God, and joy in him. The creature's happiness is\nan ultimate end because it is included in God's ultimate end,\nnamely, the communication of his internal glory “ad\nextra;” rather than being a means to God's glory, it is part of\nit. \nAn apparent consequence is that God must create a world to\ndisplay his glory. End of Creation contends both that God's\nperfections include “a propensity of nature to diffuse of his\nown fullness” and that it isn't “possible for him to be\nhindered in the exercise of his goodness and his other perfections in\ntheir proper effect.” (End of Creation, 1765; Edwards\n1957–, vol. 8, 447) It follows that God must diffuse his own\nfullness, i. e., God must create. Edwards also appears committed to\nthe claim that God necessarily creates this world (call it\nw*). God necessarily does what is “fittest and\nbest.” It is thus necessarily true that God creates the best\npossible world. Now God has created w*. Hence, w* is\nthe best possible world. ‘Being the best possible world’\nis an essential property of whatever world has it, however. It is\ntherefore necessarily true that w* is the best possible\nworld. It follows that it is necessarily true that God creates\nw*. \nWhether Edwards was aware of these consequences is uncertain. The two\nmost common objections to them, however, — that they imply that\nthere isn't any real contingency and that God isn't free — would\nnot have troubled him. For Edwards thought that our world displays\nneither contra-causal freedom nor real indeterminacy. He also believed\nthat moral agency and freedom are compatible with metaphysical\nnecessity. God can only do what is “fittest and best.” He\nis nevertheless free in the sense that he is aware of alternatives\n(the array of possible worlds), has the ability (i. e., the power and\n“skill”) to actualize any of them, is neither forced,\nconstrained nor influenced by any other being, and does precisely what\nhe wishes. Edwards believes that this is the only kind of freedom that\nis either relevant to moral agency or worth having. \nTrue virtue aims at the good of being in general and therefore also\nprizes the disposition that promotes it. Truly virtuous people thus\nlove two things — being and benevolence. They not only value\nbenevolence because it promotes the general good, however; they also\n“relish” or delight in it for its own sake. Hence, while\nvirtue “most essentially consists in benevolence to being”\n(True Virtue, 1765; Edwards 1957–, vol. 8, 540), in a\nwider sense it includes not only benevolence but also\n“complacence” in benevolence's intrinsic excellence or\nbeauty. \nGod, though, “is infinitely the greatest being,” and\n“infinitely the most beautiful and excellent.” True virtue\nthus principally consists “in a supreme love to God, both of\nbenevolence and complacence” (True Virtue, 1765;\nEdwards 1957–, vol. 8, 550–51). It follows that “a\ndetermination of mind to union and benevolence to a particular\nperson or private system [whether one's self, one's\nfamily, one's nation, or even humanity], which is but a small part of\nthe universal system of being…is not of the nature of true\nvirtue” unless it is dependent on or “subordinate to,\nbenevolence to Being in general” (True\nVirtue, 1765; Edwards 1957–, vol. 8, 554). \nOne of the principal concerns of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, et al., was\nto refute the contention that action is always motivated by self-love.\nEdwards' attitude toward these attempts is ambivalent. On the one\nhand, he denies that the truly benevolent are motivated by\nself-love. On the other, Edwards argues (against, e.g., Hutcheson)\nthat most conscientious and other regarding behavior is, indeed, a\nform of self-love and that, in any case, acts motivated by rational\nself-love, conscience, or natural other regarding instincts such as\nparental affection or pity aren't genuinely virtuous. \nConscience, for instance, is the product of a power of placing\nourselves in the situation of others (which is needed for any sort of\nmutual understanding), a sense of the natural fitness of certain\nresponses (injury and punishment or disapproval, benefit and reward or\napproval), and self-love. Placing ourselves in the situation of those\nwe have injured, we recognize that being treated in that way would not\nmerely anger us but seem unfitting or undeserved, and that we are\ntherefore inconsistent in approving of our treating others in ways we\nwould not wish to be treated ourselves. The result is a sense of\n“inconsistence” or “self-opposition” between\nfeelings of approval and disapproval toward the same action. This\nmakes us “uneasy” since “self-love implies an\ninclination to feel and act as one with ourselves” (True\nVirtue, 1765; Edwards 1957–, vol. 8, 589). \nWhat, though, about instinctual other regarding impulses such as\nparental affection, “mutual affection between the sexes”\n(as distinct from simple sexual attraction), and pity? Edwards is\ninclined to think that all except pity are forms of self-love. The\nimportant point, however, is that even if they aren't, actions\nmotivated by them aren't truly virtuous. To see why consider pity. If\ntruly virtuous actions are motivated by benevolence to being\nin general, then actions motivated by other regarding impulses which\nare ultimately directed to “some particular persons or private\nsystem” aren't truly virtuous (True Virtue, 1765;\nEdwards 1957–, vol. 8, 601). Now pity is directed to those in\nextreme distress whose suffering appears undeserved or excessive. Its\nobject is therefore restricted to only part of being in general.\nFurthermore, since instinctual affections aren't\n“dependent” on “general benevolence,” they are\nin potential conflict with it. Pity, for example, may motivate a judge\nto act unjustly. \nWe should not conclude that pity or other instinctual affections, or\neven rational self-love, are bad. Since they tend toward “the\npreservation of mankind and their comfortably subsisting in the\nworld,” things would be much worse without them (True\nVirtue, 1765; Edwards 1957–, vol. 8, 600). Edwards point\n(like Kant's) is merely that their goodness isn't a truly moral\ngoodness. The implication is nonetheless clear. Natural virtues are\neither tainted with self-love or fail to extend to being in general.\nThey are therefore counterfeits or simulacra of true virtue. While\nthey prompt us to promote the good of others, and to condemn vice,\nthey fall infinitely “short of the extent of true virtuous\nbenevolence, both in…nature and object” (True\nVirtue, 1765; Edwards 1957–, vol. 8, 609). Edwards\nconcludes that true virtue is a supernatural gift. \nIn Edwards' view, beauty or “excellency” “consists\nin the similarness of one being to another — not merely equality\nand proportion, but any kind of similarness….This is an\nuniversal definition of excellency: The consent of being to\nbeing…” (“The Mind,” no. 1; Edwards\n1957–, vol. 6, 336). One who loves others, for instance, or\nactively desires their welfare, “agrees” with them or\n“consents” to them. Love's scope can be narrower or wider,\nhowever. Agreement or consent is “comprehensive” or\n“universal” only when directed towards being in general.\nOnly true benevolence, therefore, is truly beautiful. \n“Secondary” beauty is a mere “image” or\n“resemblance” of true beauty. It consists in\n“symmetry,” “harmony,” or\n“proportion,” or “as Mr. Hutcheson” says, in\n“agreement of different things in form, manner, quantity, and\nvisible end or design,” i.e., in “regularity.” The\nbeauty of well-ordered societies, of “wisdom…consisting\nin the united tendency of thoughts, ideas, and particular volitions to\none general purpose,” of the natural fitness of actions and\ncircumstances (having made a promise, for example, and keeping it),\n“of a building, of a flower, or of the rainbow” are\nexamples (True Virtue, 1765; Edwards 1957–, vol. 8,\n561–62). \nSince God's benevolence alone is perfect, he is the only thing that is\n(truly) beautiful without qualification. The fitness of God's\ndispensations, the harmony of his providential design, and so on, also\nexhibit the highest degree of secondary beauty. God is thus\n“infinitely the most beautiful and excellent,” the measure\nof both primary and secondary beauty. Moreover, he is the\n“foundation and fountain of all beauty.” “All the\nbeauty to be found throughout the whole creation is…the\nreflection of the diffused beams of that being who hath an infinite\nfullness of brightness and glory” (True Virtue, 1765;\nEdwards 1957–, vol. 8, 550–51). And God's world is indeed\nsaturated with beauty — not only the “harmony of\nsounds, and the beauties of nature” (which bear the greatest\nresemblance to true or primary beauty, and to which Edwards was\nespecially sensitive) but also (and primarily) the beauty of the\nGospel, of God's providential work in history, and of the saints (the\nelect). The saints alone, however, can discern true beauty. \nBecause their hearts have been regenerated by the indwelling of the\nHoly Spirit, the saints love being in general. Their love is the basis\nof a new “spiritual sense” whose “immediate\nobject” is “the beauty of holiness” — a\n“new simple idea” that can't “be produced by\nexalting, varying or compounding” ideas “which they had\nbefore,” and that truly “represents” divine reality\n(Religious Affections, 1746 and True Virtue, 1765;\nEdwards 1957–, vol. 2, 205, 260, and vol. 8, 622). \nEdwards sometimes identifies true beauty with the pleasure that holy\nthings evoke in people with spiritual “frames” or\n“tempers” or with the tendency they have to evoke it. At\nother times he identifies it with the consent of being to being, i.e.,\nwith true benevolence or holiness. His view appears to be this. True\nbeauty is identical with benevolence or agreement in somewhat the same\nway in which water is identical with H2O or heat with\nmolecular motion. But benevolence is also the objective basis of a\ndispositional property, namely, a tendency to produce a new simple\nidea in the savingly converted. This idea is a delight or pleasure in\nbeing's consent to being which somehow “represents” or is\na “perception” of it. Edwards' account of true beauty thus\nresembles some accounts of color or extension. Spiritual delight is a\nsimple idea or sensation like our ideas of color or extension. The\ndispositional property is a power objects have to produce these ideas\nin our understandings. Benevolence is the objective configuration\nunderlying this power and corresponds to the microstructure of bodies\nthat underlie their tendency to excite ideas of color or extension in\nminds like ours. Like simple ideas of redness, say, or extension, the\nnew spiritual sensation “represents” or is a\n“perception” of its object. Just as ‘red’ or\n‘extension’ can refer to the idea, the power, or the\nphysical configuration that is the basis of the power, so “true\nbeauty” can refer to the spiritual sensation, to the relevant\ndispositional property, or to benevolence. \nEdwards calls the new mode of spiritual understanding a\n“sense” because the apprehension of spiritual beauty is\n(1) non-inferential and (2) involuntary, and Edwards, like Hutcheson,\nassociates sensation with immediacy and passivity. (3) It also\ninvolves relish or delight, and Edwards followed Locke and Hutcheson\nin thinking that, like a feeling of tactual pressure or an impression\nof redness, being pleased or pained is a kind of sensation or\nperception. Finally, (4) the new mode of understanding is the source\nof a new simple idea, and Edwards shared Locke's and Hutcheson's\nconviction that simple ideas come “from experience.” \nThe saints alone are in an epistemic position to discern truths of\nreligion that are dependent on the “excellency of divine\nthings”. For example, a conviction of Christ's sufficiency as a\nmediator depends on an apprehension of his beauty and excellency. Or,\nagain, one must see the beauty of holiness to appreciate the\n“hatefulness of sin,” and thus be convinced of the justice\nof divine punishment and our inability to make restitution. The new\nsense also helps us grasp the truth of the gospel scheme as a whole. A\nconviction of its truth is an immediate inference from a perception of\nthe beauty or splendor of what it depicts, namely, “God and\nJesus Christ…the work of redemption, and the ways and works of\nGod” (A Divine and Supernatural Light, 1734; Edwards\n1957–, vol. 17, 413). \nEdwards' defense of the objectivity of the new spiritual sense has\nfour steps. (1) Benevolence agrees with the nature of things. The\nworld is an interconnected system of minds and ideas in which the only\ntrue substance and cause is an infinite and omnipotent love. Human\nbenevolence is thus an appropriate or fitting response to reality. (2)\nBenevolence is pleased by benevolence; it relishes it, or delights in\nit, for its own sake. Since benevolence is an appropriate response to\nreality, so too is benevolence's delight in benevolence. (3) But a\ndelight in benevolence just is a perception of its spiritual beauty.\nIt follows that (4) the redeemed's spiritual perceptions are veridical\n— “representations” of something “besides what\n[is] in [their] own minds” (True Virtue, 1765; Edwards\n1957–, vol. 8, 622). \nThere is also an implicit theological defense of the spiritual sense's\nobjectivity. “True saving grace is no other than the very love\nof God; that is, God in one of the persons of the Trinity, uniting\nhimself to the soul of the creature as a vital principle, dwelling\nthere and exerting himself by the faculties of the soul of man in his\nown proper nature after the manner of a principle of nature.”\nThe saints are thus “not only partakers of a nature that may in\nsome sense be called divine because ‘tis conformed to the nature\nof God; but the very Deity does in some sense dwell in them”\n(Treatise on Grace,; Edwards 1957–, vol. 21, 194).\n(There were Puritan precedents for these claims.) \nEdwards is making two claims. First, the new spiritual disposition and\ntastes which God bestows on the soul are divine. The differences\nbetween God's love and joy and the love and joy that he bestows on his\nsaints is a difference of degree, not of nature or kind. Second, God\ndoes not act on the soul from without, but dwells within it “as\na principle of a [new] nature,” living, acting, and exerting\nhimself in the exercise of the soul's faculties. The\n“mechanism” underlying the new spiritual sense thus\nultimately turns out to be God himself. Hence, since God in some sense\nis reality or being itself, it follows that the spiritual\nsense is necessarily aligned with reality. \nEdwards thinks that reason can prove that God exists, establish many\nof his attributes, discern our obligations to him, and mount a\nprobable case for the credibility of scripture. But he also believes\nthat grace is needed both to help the natural principles\n“against those things that tend to stupefy [them] and to hinder\n[their] free exercise,” and to sanctify “the reasoning\nfaculty and” assist “it to see the clear evidence there is\nof the truth of religion in rational arguments”\n(“Miscellanies,” nos. 626, 628; Edwards 1957–, vol.\n18, 155, 156f). \nHis view is briefly this. “Actual ideas” are ideas that\nare lively, clear, and distinct. Thought has a tendency to substitute\n“signs” (i. e., words or images) for actual ideas. While\nthis tendency is useful and normally quite harmless, it impedes\nreasoning when “we are at a loss concerning a connection or\nconsequence [between ideas], or have a new inference to draw, or would\nsee the force of some new argument” (“Miscellanies,”\nno. 782; Edwards 1957–, vol. 18, 457). Since accurate reasoning\nabout a subject matter requires attending to actual ideas of it, one\ncan't accurately reason about religion if one lacks the relevant actual\nideas. To have an actual idea of God, for example, one must have\nactual ideas of the ideas that compose it. But most of us don't. Those\nparts of the idea of God that everyone has (ideas of knowledge, power,\nand justice, for instance) either aren't attended to or, if they are,\nfail to elicit the appropriate affective reaction. In addition, we\ncan't fully understand ideas of affections which we haven't\nexperienced and so can't properly understand God's benevolence if we\naren't benevolent ourselves. And without the simple idea of true\nbeauty, one can understand neither God's holiness nor the facts that\ndepend on it. \nTrue benevolence remedies these deficiencies. Because the desires of\nthe truly benevolent are properly ordered, they attend to ideas of\nreligion and are suitably affected by the ideas of God's attributes\nand activities that everyone has. (They fear his wrath, for example,\nand are grateful for his benefits.) Furthermore, they understand God's\nbenevolence because their own benevolence mirrors it. Finally, the\ntruly benevolent delight in the benevolence in which holiness\nconsists, i.e., they “perceive” or “taste” or\n“relish” its beauty. Edwards' claim, then, is that to\nreason accurately about God one must have an actual idea of him, and\nto have that one must be truly benevolent. Right reasoning about\nreligious matters requires right affections. \nEdwards is an evidentialist. Rational religious beliefs are either\nproperly basic or rest on good evidence. A belief that the gospel\nscheme exhibits true beauty is an example of the former. But most\nreligious beliefs depend on evidence. Sometimes this evidence includes\nthe idea of true beauty. Even when it does not, however, the right\naffections are needed to appreciate its force. In either case, only\nthose with properly disposed hearts can read the evidence\ncorrectly. \nThe trustees of the College of New Jersey invited Edwards to become\nits third president in 1753. In his reply Edwards gave a number of\nreasons why he hesitated to accept their offer. Among these was the\nfear that doing so would interfere with the completion of “a\ngreat work” which he had long contemplated “which I call a\nHistory of the Work of Redemption, a body of divinity in an\nentire new method, being thrown into the form of an history;\nconsidering the affair of Christian theology, as the whole of it, in\neach part, stands in reference to the great work of redemption by\nJesus Christ…” (Edwards 1957–, vol. 16, 727f).\nAlthough Edwards' project was aborted by his untimely death, it would\nundoubtedly have been based on a sermon series delivered in 1739 which\ntraces the work of redemption “from the fall of man to the end\nof the world.” The proposed history would have been the\nculmination of the project begun in True Virtue and End\nof Creation. For creation and providence are subordinate to a\nredemption which is itself subordinate only to God's glory. The\nhistory of redemption is “the summum and\nultimum of all the divine operations and decrees,” the\nmanifestation of God's internal glory in time (Edwards 1957–,\nvol. 16, 728). Edwards' History would also have provided a\nfitting climax to his intellectual career as a whole. For it is in his\nwork of redemption that God's sovereignty, holiness, and splendor are\nmost fully displayed.  \nIt is doubtful, however, that Edwards' work would have anticipated\nmodern historiography as some claim. For one thing, the sermon series\nis essentially a doctrinal work. (The section on Christ's\nearthly ministry, for instance, is a discussion of the incarnation and\natonement, not a life of Jesus.) For another, Edwards' sources include\nnot only biblical and “profane” histories but biblical\nprophecy as well. Finally, Edwards doesn't restrict himself to natural\ncauses in explaining events but also appeals to divine decrees and\ntypology. \nWhatever novelty the sermon series possesses is literary and\ntheological. It partly consists in the rich skein of images Edwards\nuses to connect the events of redemption history. These include the\nmodel of a river and its tributaries, a tree and its branches, the\nconstruction of a building, the conduct of war, and “a\nwheel,” or “a machine composed of wheels” with its\nreminiscences both of Ezekiel's vision of the divine throne chariot\nand of clockwork (“Images of Divine Things,” no. 89;\nEdwards 1957–, vol. 11, 86). It also consists in Edwards'\nextension of typology, the practice of interpreting things, persons,\nor events (the “type”) as symbols or prefigurations of\nfuture realities (the “antitype”). Protestant divines had\ntended to restrict typology to figures, actions, and objects in the\nOld Testament which in their view shadowed forth Christ as their\nantitype. Edwards interprets the New Testament typologically as well,\narguing that relevant passages prefigure events in the church's later\nhistory. Most radically, Edwards construes nature typologically.\n(Whether this constitutes a step towards Emerson and Thoreau, as some\nclaim, is a moot point.) Finally, Edwards' emphasis on the objective\nside of God's act of redemption is comparatively rare in a Puritanism\nwhich tended to stress the redemption's application to individual\nsouls. (The subjective side is extensively treated in a number of\nworks of the 1730s and 1740s, however, the most important of which is\nReligious Affections.)"}]
