It does, however, avoid appeals to special\nnon-natural faculties (ESP, telepathy, mystical experience) or\nsupernatural sources of information (sacred texts, revealed theology,\ncreedal authorities, direct supernatural communication). In general,\nnatural religion or theology (hereafter “natural\ntheology”) aims to adhere to the same standards of rational\ninvestigation as other philosophical and scientific enterprises, and\nis subject to the same methods of evaluation and critique. Natural\ntheology is typically contrasted with “revealed theology”,\nwhere the latter explicitly appeals to special revelations such as\nmiracles, scriptures, and divinely-superintended commentaries and\ncreedal formulations. (See DeCruz and DeSmedt 2015)\n\n\nPhilosophers and religious thinkers across almost every epoch and\ntradition (Near Eastern, African, Asian, and European) have engaged\nthe project of natural theology, either as proponents or critics. The\nquestion of whether natural theology is a viable project is at the\nroot of some of the deepest religious divisions: Shi’ite\nthinkers are optimistic about reason’s ability to prove various\ntheological and ethical truths, for instance, while Sunnis are not;\nRoman Catholic theologians typically think that reason provides\ndemonstrations of the existence of God, while many Protestant\ntheologians do not. Unlike most of the topics discussed in an\nencyclopedia of philosophy, this is one over which wars have been\nfought and throats have been cut.\n\n\nThe most active discussions of natural theology in the West occurred\nduring the high medieval period (roughly 1100–1400 C.E.) and the\nearly modern period (1600–1800 C.E.). The past few decades have\nwitnessed a revival of natural theological debate in the public\nsphere: there are now institutes promoting “Intelligent Design\nTheory”, popular apologetics courses, campus debates between\nbelievers and agnostics, a “New Atheist” movement, Youtube\ndebates between apologists and atheists regarding new books in natural\ntheology (such as the one between Nathan Lewis and Bernie Dehler on\nthe Blackwell Companion to Natural\n Theology),[2]\n and TED talks by famous atheists on how to resist natural religion\n(such as the one by Richard Dawkins in February\n 2002).[3]\n \n\n\nAmong professional philosophers (who aren’t typically part of\nthese more popular debates), arguments over our ability to justify\npositive or negative answers to religious questions have become fairly\ntechnical, often employing sophisticated logical techniques in an\neffort to advance the discussion instead of retreading the same old\nground. The prestigious Gifford Lectures series hosted by a consortium\nof Scottish universities, however, has tried to feature new but still\naccessible work in natural theology for over 100 years (it too has a\nYoutube\n channel!)[4]\n \n\nIn this article, we aim to avoid most the more recent complexities but\nalso explain their origins by focusing on some central developments in\nthe early modern period that helped to frame contemporary natural\ntheological debates. We are focused here only on theoretical\narguments (both a priori and a posteriori or\nempirical ones). It is controversial whether moral arguments\nare also part of natural theology, but we set them aside here (see\nalso the entry on\n God, arguments for the existence of: moral arguments).\n \nTheologians often follow Immanuel Kant’s example and address\nvarious “prolegomena” or preliminary questions before\ntrying to do any substantive metaphysics. These include questions\nabout the nature of religious language and about whether or not we are\nin principle able to access and understand religious truths. \nAgain, we will use the term “natural theologian” to refer\nto someone who aims to use ordinary human cognitive faculties (reason,\nsense-perception, introspection) to establish positive truths about\nthe existence and nature of God and other religiously significant,\nsupersensible beings or states of affairs. Such a person presupposes\nthat sentences in human language (or at least sentences in the\nlanguage of human thought) can express some theological truths, even\nif other such truths are beyond us. \nCritics of natural theology sometimes challenge these semantic\npresuppositions. They provide reasons to think that our thoughts,\nconcepts, or sentences are incapable of expressing theological truths,\nbecause they are incapable of referring adequately to the transcendent\nentities that play an important role in many religious\ndoctrines—entities such as Judaism’s YHWH,\nNeo-Platonism’s One, Vedanta’s Brahman, Mormonism’s\nHeavenly Father, and so on. The debate surrounding these issues is\noften designated “the problem of religious language”, but\nit is usually as much about human concepts as it is about\nsentences in natural languages.  \nIn the western tradition, there have been a few periods of especially\nactive discussion of these prolegomenal issues. The Neo-Platonic era\nwas one (see the discussion of negative theology in the entry on\n Plotinus),\n the high medieval period (1100–1400 or so) was another, the\nEnlightenment movement in 17th–18th\ncentury Europe (especially the empiricist portion of it) was a third.\nMore recent discussions have involved both analytic and continental\nfigures: A.J. Ayer, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, Antony\nFlew, Norman Malcolm, Emmanuel Levinas, and William P. Alston have\neach discussed, in very different ways, the question of whether and\nhow our language might succeed in referring to transcendent entities.\nHowever, since the 1970s, analytic philosophers have turned away from\na focus on language to a revival of metaphysics, and the\n“problem of religious language” has been much less\nprominent. \nIn addition to questions about what religious language refers to and\nhow (if at all) religious concepts apply, the natural\ntheologian faces another set of preliminary questions about our\nability to generate sound arguments about such entities or\nfacts. Our sense-perceptual and rational faculties are clearly limited\nand fallible. There are presumably many facts about the natural\nuniverse that we are incapable of grasping due to their complexity or\ninaccessibility. So why should we think that our natural faculties can\ndeliver truths about even more remote or transcendent entities?  \nA related debate concerns whether natural theology is the only method\nby which we can have access to the domain of truths about\nsupersensible realities of religious interests. Some practitioners\n(call them rationalists) argue that only propositions that can\nbe justified by unaided human reason are candidates for permissible\nbelief. Others (call them hybridists) allow that our natural\nfaculties can take us a certain distance—to knowledge of the\nbasic nature and even existence of God, say—but argue that we\nmust ultimately appeal to revelation and faith when it comes\nto more specific doctrines regarding the divine nature, acts, and\nintentions. This is the canonical Roman Catholic position on faith and\nreason developed in authors such as Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, and\nrevived in the natural scientific context of the Renaissance by\nCatalan scholar Raymond Sebond (1385–1436). Sebond’s Latin\nwork, Theologia Naturalis (1434–1436), became famous\nwhen Michel de Montaigne translated it into French in 1569 and made it\nthe subject of the longest of his renowned Essays\n(‘Apology for Raymond Sebond’), in 1580. \nThere are many kinds of hybridists: while they all think a turn to\nfaith is necessary at some point, some seek to establish little more\nthan the bare existence of God before turning to faith for greater\ndetails. Others think it is possible to develop a more robust\nunderstanding of God from within the bounds of reason and\nsense-perception. Indeed, in recent years the so-called\n“ramified natural theology” movement has sought to use our\nnatural faculties to demonstrate (or show to be highly probable)\nrobust doctrines that go well beyond bare theism—for example,\nspecifically Christian doctrines such as that of the Trinity, the\nresurrection, or the historical authenticity of certain miracles or\nbiblical prophecies (Swinburne 2003; Newman et al. 2003; Gauch Jr.\n2011; see\n section 4 below).\n  \nOpponents of natural religion or theology, by contrast, deny\nthat reason and our other ordinary perceptual capacities can justify\nreligious beliefs. Some of these opponents are fideists (e.g.,\non some readings, Tertullian, Blaise Pascal, Pierre Bayle, J.G.\nHamann, F.H. Jacobi, and Søren Kierkegaard) who hold these same\nbeliefs as articles of faith rather than as teachings of reason (see\nthe entry on\n fideism).\n Pascal, for instance, was a preeminent mathematician with strong\ninterests in natural theology, but ultimately concluded (during what\nhe called a “night of fire” in November 1654) that unaided\nreason is more likely to lead us to the false god “of\nphilosophers and scholars” than to the true “God of\nAbraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob”. The 20th\ncentury Reformed theologian Karl Barth opposed natural theology for\nmuch the same reason, and made his opposition to Emil Brunner’s\nversion of the hybridist project clear in a book titled simply\n“Nein!” (Barth 1934). In his Gifford Lectures\n(which were endowed by Lord Gifford to be a lecture series about\nnatural theology), contemporary theologian Stanley Hauerwas espouses a\nfideistic view in the tradition of Pascal and Barth but claims\n(somewhat perversely) that his project (which incorporates biblical\ntexts and specifically Christian doctrines) counts as “natural\ntheology” all the same (Hauerwas 2001: 15ff). \nOther opponents of natural theology are agnostics who do not\nfind the fideist’s turn to faith appealing. They deny that our\nnatural faculties succeed in justifying any positive or negative\nsubstantial (i.e., non-analytic) theistic beliefs, and consequently\nsuspend belief. Agnostics differ, however, as to whether unaided\nreason could in principle but does not in fact\njustify such beliefs (thus Bertrand Russell’s famous response to\na question about what he would say if he were to die and then confront\nGod on judgment day: “not enough evidence, God, not enough\nevidence!”), or whether our unaided faculties are not even\nin principle adequate to the task.  \nStill other opponents of natural theology are atheists.\nAtheists agree with fideists and agnostics that our natural faculties\ncannot establish the existence of God or other religious entities. But\nthat’s because they think those faculties provide reasons to\nbelieve that such entities do not exist at all (see the entry on\n atheism and agnosticism).\n One such reason is the negative one that we cannot produce any sound\narguments for theistic claims. But atheists also often maintain that\nthere are positive reasons to believe that God does not\nexist—the incoherence of the concept of God, for instance, or\nthe incompatibility of God’s existence and the existence of\nhorrendous suffering and evil (see the entry on the problem of\n evil). \nThere are many ways to approach a survey of natural theology. Here we\nhave chosen to focus largely on the classic historical discussions,\nand in particular on the debates in the medieval and Enlightenment\n(17th–18th century) periods in the west.\nWe will consider versions of the two basic kinds of positive argument\nin favor of religious theses: a priori arguments and a\nposteriori arguments. There are species of each of these. \nA priori arguments are those that do not require an appeal to\nparticular sense-perceptual experiences in order to justify their\nconclusions. Immanuel Kant gave the name\n“ontological” to a priori arguments that aim to\nprove the existence of an object from a concept or an idea of that\nobject (see the entry on\n ontological arguments).\n But the argument over whether such a strategy can establish the\nexistence of God began well before Kant’s time. \nAn early and now-canonical formulation of the ontological argument is\nfound in the second book of St. Anselm’s Proslogion\n(Anselm 1077–78). Anselm begins by characterizing God as the\n“being than which none greater can be thought” and then\nseeks to show that such a being does and indeed must exist.  \nAnselm’s argument can be reconstructed in various ways (see the\nentry on\n Saint Anselm),\n but here is one: \nIn support of (2), Anselm notes that \n[T]he fool has said in his heart that “There is no God”.\nBut when this same Fool hears me say “something than which\nnothing greater can be thought”, he surely understands what he\nhears; and what he understands exists in his understanding, even if he\ndoes not understand that it exists [in reality]. (Anselm\n81–2) \nSo according to Anselm, even the “foolish” atheist\nunderstands the term “God” when he argues that\nGod does not exist. By this Anselm simply means that the atheist has\nthe idea of God, and thus has God “in his\nunderstanding”. \nPremise (4) presupposes that things can exist in a number of different\nways or modes. One of those ways is as the object of an\nidea—i.e., existence “in the understanding”. Another\nway for it to exist is “in reality”. (4) articulates a\ncomparative value judgment about these ways of existing: it is\ngreater for something to exist in both ways than it\nis to exist merely in the first way.  \nIn order to deduce (5) from (3) and (4), Anselm uses a reductio ad\nabsurdum argument: \nAnd surely that than which a greater cannot be thought cannot exist\nonly in the understanding. For if it exists only in the understanding,\nit can be thought to exist in reality as well, which is greater.\n(Anselm 82) \nMore explicitly: \nPhilosophers and theologians have made numerous efforts to revive or\ndemolish Anselm’s argument over the centuries. The most\ninfluential proponents include René Descartes, Gottfried\nLeibniz, Charles Hartshorne, Norman Malcolm, Robert M. Adams, and\nAlvin Plantinga. Its main detractors include Anselm’s\ncontemporaneous interlocutor—a monk named Gaunilo—as well\nas Thomas Aquinas, Descartes’ correspondents Johannes Caterus,\nMarin Mersenne, and Antoine Arnauld, Immanuel Kant, and, more\nrecently, David Lewis (1970), Peter van Inwagen (1977), and Graham\nOppy (1996, 2009). In what follows, a number of the relevant moves in\nthe early modern discussion will be considered, as well as some\ncontemporary developments of the 17th century modal\nargument. \nDescartes’ ontological argument, first presented in the Fifth\nMeditation, aims to prove the existence of God from the idea of God\n(Descartes 1641, cited below from the edition by Adam and Tannery\n(1962–1976) and referred to as “AT”). Here is one\nway to formulate the argument (compare Pereboom 1996, 2010; for\nalternatives see the entry on\n Descartes’ Ontological Argument): \nOne prominent way of resisting this argument is to reduce it to\nabsurdity by appeal to “parity of reasoning”. Johannes\nCaterus, for instance, objected to Descartes that by a precisely\nparallel form of reasoning we could prove the real existence of the\nobject of an idea of an existent lion (AT 7.99). Gaunilo’s reply\nto Anselm centuries earlier was similar: by parity of reasoning, one\ncan prove the existence in reality (and not just in the understanding)\nof the maximally perfect island (Anselm 102). \nThe objection aims to show that, like the idea God, the idea of the\nexistent lion and the idea of the maximally perfect island include\nexistence, and thus the existence of these objects can be established\nvia an ontological argument. But the claim that the existence of\nCaterus’s lion and Gaunilo’s island can be established in\nthis way is absurd, and thus the same holds for the theistic\nontological argument. Note that this parity argument via a\nreductio ad absurdum, if successful, would show that the\nontological argument is unsound, but without indicating which step in\nthe reasoning is at fault. \nA second objection, anticipated by Descartes in the Fifth Meditation,\nis that truly predicating a property of something without specifying\nany conditions or intentional contexts involves an affirmation that\nthe thing exists. So from the truth of “Macron is the President\nof France”, one can conclude that Macron exists. As a result,\n“Pegasus is a winged horse” is strictly speaking false,\nthough by using the intentional context “according to the\nmyth” we can say, truly, “According to the myth, Pegasus\nis a winged horse”. This suggests that premise (3) above is\nsubject to a decisive challenge, and Descartes can legitimately claim\nonly, for instance “According to the idea of God, God has all\nperfections”, or “If God exists, then God has all\nperfections”. But then all that follows in step (6) is the\nunspectacular conclusion that “According to the idea of God, God\nexists”, or, even less impressively, “If God exists, then\nGod exists”.  \nA third problem, raised in the Second Objections by Father Marin\nMersenne, is that the argument would be sound only if a maximally\nperfect being is really possible, or, equivalently, only if there is a\ngenuine divine essence. But this, Mersenne complains, has not been\nestablished (AT 7.127). (Side note: Gaunilo and Mersenne are good\nexamples of how devout theists might still take issue with natural\ntheological efforts to prove God’s existence.) \nDescartes’ reply to these objections involves the notion of a\n“true and immutable nature” (“TIN”) (AT\n7.101ff.). Only some of our ideas of things that have TINs. Moreover,\nTINs themselves exist in some way, although they need not exist in\nconcrete or empirical reality. Perhaps they are abstract objects, like\nnumbers or sets (Descartes explicitly compares them to Plato’s\nForms). In any case, the kind of existence TINs have is sufficient to\nundermine the second objection above: the divine\nessence—God’s nature—is a true and\nimmutable nature, and thus we do not need to prefix anything like the\nphrase “According to the idea of God” to premise (3).\nRather, Descartes thinks we can clearly and distinctly perceive that\nGod’s nature is a TIN, and that this TIN contains all\nperfections. Thus we can conclude that “God has all\nperfections”. That would make the inference to (6) a valid one.\n \nDescartes’ challenge, then, is to show that God’s nature\nis a TIN and that the natures of an “existent lion” and\n“the maximally perfect island” are not TINs. In the Fifth\nMeditation Descartes maintains that TINs are different from fictitious\nideas in that TINs are in some sense independent of the thought of\ntheir conceivers. For example, the nature of a triangle is a TIN\nbecause it contains properties that we don’t grasp when we first\nform the idea of a triangle, and deducing these further properties is\na process “more like discovery than creation”. God’s\nnature also has this feature—we obviously don’t grasp all\nof the properties of the maximally perfect being when we first form an\nidea of it. The problem, however, is that it is not clear how this\ncriterion would rule out the natures of a most perfect island or an\nexistent lion as TINs, since in those cases we also don’t grasp\nall of the properties when we first form the idea.  \nLater, Descartes (AT 7.83–4) characterizes a TIN as having a\nunity such that it cannot be divided by the intellect. He thinks that\nhaving this feature shows that is hasn’t been simply put\ntogether by the intellect or imagination, and is thus a genuine\nnature. Accordingly, the idea of an existent lion does not correspond\nto a TIN because I can coherently conceive of a lion that\ndoesn’t exist. Likewise I can coherently conceive of a maximally\nperfect island having one fewer coconut tree but one more mango tree,\nand so on. But it also seems that I can conceive of some of the divine\nperfections without others (i.e. of an omnipotent being that is\nlacking maximal benevolence). So by this standard it appears that the\nidea of God also fails to correspond to a true and immutable nature.\nNote: Descartes himself seems to resist this objection by arguing that\nall of the divine perfections ultimately boil down to sovereignty or\nomnipotence.  \nTo the third problem, concerning the real possibility of God,\nDescartes replies that our clear and distinct ideas of\nTINs—produced in us by reason—are reliable. Since we can\n(supposedly) see clearly and distinctly that there is no contradiction\nin our idea of God’s nature, the denial that God is really\npossible is on equal footing with the denial that the angles of a\ntriangle are equal to two right angles (AT 7.150–1). \nLeibniz addresses several of the central objections to\nDescartes’ ontological argument (in, e.g., Leibniz 1676 [PP]:\n167–8; 1677 [PP]: 177–80; 1684 [PP]: 292–3; 1692\n[PP]: 386; 1678 [PE]: 237–39; 1699 [PE]: 287–88; Adams\n1994: 135–56). These include: \nIn several places Leibniz addresses (A) by arguing that by\n“God” we understand a necessary being, and that from this\nit follows that the essence of God involves necessary existence. In\nthis way we supposedly avoid altogether the premise that existence is\na perfection. (One wonders, however, whether the argument for\nincluding “necessary existence” in the idea of God will\nneed to rely on the premise that necessary existence is a\nperfection.) \nIn some writings Leibniz tries to bypass (B) by presenting an argument\nwith a different conditional as its conclusion (see Adams 1994:\n135–42): \nWhat has yet to be dealt with, clearly, is Mersenne’s problem\nabove—(C), that the real possibility of a most perfect being\ncannot be demonstrated. Leibniz offers several types of arguments\nagainst this. One relies on the fact that other things are\nclearly possible, together with the claim that only a necessary being\nprovides a satisfactory ground or explanation for the possible\nexistence of contingent beings. So on the assumption that contingent\nbeings possibly exist, it must be at least possible for God, as a\nnecessary being, to exist (for more on this kind of argument from\npossibility, see section 2.3 below).  \nA second type of Leibnizian argument for God’s real possibility\nreturns to the thesis that God is the most perfect being, and adds\nthat perfections are positive and simple, unanalyzable qualities. So,\nfor example, consider any proposition of the form “A\nand B are incompatible”, where A and\nB are any two perfections. Two properties are incompatible\nonly if they are logically incompatible, according to Leibniz. Thus\n“A and B are incompatible” will be true\nonly if one of these perfections turns out to be the negation of the\nother (as in omniscient and non-omniscient), or if\ntheir analyses reveal simpler properties, one of which is a negation\nof another. But on the assumption that all the divine perfections are\npositive, simple, and thus unanalyzable, neither of these scenarios\ncan obtain. Consequently, “A and B are\ncompatible” is always true for any two perfections, and thus a\nbeing with all perfections is really possible (Leibniz 1678 [PE]:\n238–39; Adams 1994: 142–48).  \nA third Leibnizean response to Mersenne’s objection is that it\nis rational to presume the real possibility of the things we\ncan conceive, at least until their impossibility has been\ndemonstrated. \nKant’s most famous criticism of the ontological argument is\nencapsulated in his claim that “existence” (or\n“exists”) is not a positive determination or “real\npredicate” (Kant 1781/1787: A592/B619ff). Alternatively,\n“existence” is not “a predicate that is added to the\nconcept of the subject and enlarges it” (A598/B626; see Stang\n2016 and Pasternack 2018 for discussion). Kant’s idea here is\nthat since “existence” is not a real predicate, existing\ncannot be one of God’s perfections.  \nOne way to interpret the objection is as follows: \n(4) is the key premise in this formulation—does coming into\nexistence involve a genuine change? There is clearly a technical sense\nin which saying that a concept applies to something does not enlarge\nthe concept or change our conception of the being it refers to. But it\nmight remain open that a being that has all perfections but does not\nexist is not as great as a being that has all perfections and also\nexists. \nKant’s objection can perhaps be avoided altogether by proposing\nthat the perfection at issue is necessary existence, and not\nmere existence. Adding necessary existence to our concept of\na being would presumably involve changing it (and thus enlarging its\nconcept). This is effectively a modal version of the ontological\nargument (see\n section 2.1.5). \nKant’s most pressing criticism, in our view, goes back to the\nissue raised by Mersenne: we cannot determine whether God (conceived\nas having necessary existence or not) is really possible. Kant grants\nto Leibniz that the notion of a most perfect being may not involve a\nlogical contradiction, but he argues that this is not enough to show\nthat it is really possible, for there are ways of being impossible\nthat do not involve logical contradictions (A602/B630). The\nimplication for the ontological argument is that we cannot know or\nrationally presume that it is really possible for the divine\nperfections to be jointly exemplified even if we know that they\ninvolve no contradiction. \nFor how can my reason presume to know how the highest realities\noperate, what effects would arise from them, and what sort of relation\nall these realities would have to each other? (Kant LPT [AK\n28:1025–26]) \nVersions of the ontological argument discussed by Leibniz and Kant\nhave been elaborated by Robert M. Adams (1971), Alvin Plantinga\n(1979), Peter van Inwagen (1977, 2009) and others. These versions\nemploy contemporary modal semantics and metaphysics to motivate the\nfollowing two assumptions: \nThe argument then proceeds as follows: \nCritics have resisted numerous aspects of the argument (for\ncomprehensive discussion, see Oppy 1996). The inference to (7), for\ninstance, assumes that the actual world is possible relative\nto w*. But that assumption is only legitimate on some models\nof how talk of modality (i.e. of possibility and necessity) works.\nThus, the critic claims, it hasn’t been shown that w*\nhas the relation to the actual world that licenses the conclusion that\nGod actually exists. \nThe most significant disagreement, however, is again the one that\nMersenne raised against Descartes. How can the claim about\nmetaphysical possibility in (1) be justified? Adams (1994: ch.8),\nfollowing Leibniz, claims that we are rationally permitted, in the\nabsence of strong reasons to the contrary, to presume the\nreal possibility of most things, including God. Others argue that no\nsuch presumption of metaphysical possibility is justified, especially\nregarding supersensible things. \nLeibniz’s argument for God’s existence from the existence\nof the necessary truths crucially involves the premises that all\ntruths are true in virtue of something distinct from them (they need\nwhat contemporary metaphysicans sometimes call a\n“truth-maker”). Since necessary truths would be true even\nif there were no finite minds to think them, such truths cannot be\ntrue in virtue of facts about human psychology. Against the Platonic\nsuggestion that they are true in virtue of Forms existing outside of\nany mind whatsoever, Leibniz argues that some of the truths are about\nabstract entities, which are not the kinds of things that could have\nmind-independent existence. The only contender that remains, then, is\nthat these truths are true in virtue of the ideas in an infinite and\nnecessarily existent (divine) mind (Leibniz 1714 [PP]: 647; Adams\n1994: 177ff.). \nLeibniz’s argument stakes out one position on the grounding of\nnecessary truths, but there are many rival views that do not invoke\nthe existence of a necessary and eternal divine mind. A Platonist\nmight respond by claiming that it hasn’t been shown that\nabstract entities do not have mind-independent existence, while\nHumeans would argue that necessary truths are all analytic, and that\ntherefore only the structure of language or of our conceptual schemes\nis required to ground their truth. \nA third sort of a priori proof argues from facts about the\nmere possibility of something (or of some collection of things) to the\nexistence of a “ground of possibility” that somehow\nexplains them. An early version of such an argument can be found in\nAugustine and the Neo-Platonic tradition, but the canonical\npresentations of this sort of “possibility proof” are in\nLeibniz’s Monadology (1714) and, much more elaborately,\nin Kant’s book-length treatise called The Only Possible\nBasis for a Demonstration of the Existence of God (1763). Note\nthat if truths about what is possible are necessary truths, as they\nindeed seem to be, then this might be a more specific version of the\nargument from necessary truths (see\n 2.2). \nKant’s version of the argument is based on the claim that there\nare real possibilities that are not grounded in the principle of\nnon-contradiction, but that nevertheless must have a ground or\nexplanation (Kant 1763 [AK 2: 63ff]). If they are not grounded in the\nprinciple of non-contradiction, then they are not grounded in\nGod’s thinking them rather than their negations, which is how\nLeibniz had proposed that all such possibilities are grounded. Put the\nother way around, Kant thinks that some impossibilities are\ngrounded not in the law of non-contradiction, but in a\nnon-logical kind of “real repugnance” between two or more\nof their properties. Kant maintains, for instance, that it is\nimpossible for a material being to be conscious, even though no\nlogical contradiction exists between material and\nconscious (Kant 1763 [AK 2: 85–6]). It follows that\nthis impossibility is not grounded in divine thought, for God can\nthink any proposition that does not involve a contradiction. So facts\nabout some real possibilities and real impossibilities can only be\ngrounded in a necessary being that somehow exemplifies\n(rather than merely thinking) every combination of fundamental\nproperties whose joint exemplification is really possible. That being,\nof course, is supposed to be God. (For discussion, see Fisher and\nWatkins 1998; Adams 2000; Chignell 2009, 2012, 2014; Stang 2010; Abaci\n2014; Yong 2014; Hoffer 2016; Abaci 2019; Oberst 2018, 2020). \nOne way out of this argument is simply to claim that some real\npossibilities are primitive or ungrounded. This appears to be an\noption for Kant in his critical period insofar as he is no longer\ncommitted to rationalist principles such as the Principle of\nSufficient Reason (see Abaci 2019). Still, even in his critical period\n(i.e., after 1770 or so), Kant never repudiated the earlier\nproof—and supposedly claimed in a lecture from the 1780s that it\n“can in no way be refuted” (Kant LPT [AK 28: 1034]). This\nsuggests that in his critical period Kant still held that God’s\nexistence is the only available ground for real possibility, but that\nthe explanatory point may justify at most a kind of theoretical belief\n(Glaube) rather than full demonstrative knowledge (see\nChignell 2009, Stang 2016, and Oberst 2020). \nAn a posteriori argument involves at least one premise whose\njustification essentially appeals to some sort of empirical fact or\nexperience. The main demonstrative a posteriori argument is\nwhat Kant dubbed “the cosmological argument”. It is\nmotivated by the familiar question “Why is there something\nrather than nothing?” and goes from the empirical fact of the\nexistence of something (or of the cosmos as a whole, perhaps) to the\nexistence of a first cause or ground of that cosmos that is, at least\nin part, not identical to that cosmos. Cosmological arguments are\nfound across almost every philosophical tradition, and find prominence\nin the West in the writings of Aristotle, Avicenna,\nal-Gh&amacr;z&amacr;li, Maimonides, Aquinas, Locke, Leibniz, Samuel\nClarke, and David Hume. Here we will start with Avicenna, but then\nfocus largely on the early modern period. \nAvicenna (980–1037), whose Arabic name is Ibn Sina, sets out\ncosmological arguments in a number of works, but a detailed version is\nfound in his Remarks and Admonitions (Kitab al-Isharat wa\nl-Tanbihat) (Avicenna [ISR]; Mayer 2001). He begins with a claim\nabout contingently existing things: since it is possible for a\ncontingent thing either to exist or not to exist, whether it exists or\nnot hangs in the balance. But then, if a contingent thing does exist,\nthere must be something external to it, a cause, that accounts for its\nexisting rather than not. This establishes a principle crucial to the\nargument: “the existence of every contingent is from other than\nit.” \nAvicenna next considers the aggregate of all the existing contingent\nindividual things, the existence of each of which is accounted for by\nits causal antecedents. He then proposes and evaluates four options\nfor accounting for the aggregate’s existence. The first is that\nthe existence of the aggregate does not require a cause. However,\ngiven the principle that the existence of any contingent thing must\nhave a cause, the aggregate would then have to exist necessarily. But\nthe aggregate’s existing necessarily is ruled out by the fact\nthat all of the individuals in it are contingent things. On the second\noption, the cause of the existence of the aggregate is “the\nindividuals all together.” But then the aggregate would cause\nitself to exist, which is ruled out by the principle that the\nexistence of any contingent thing requires a cause other than it. The\nthird option is that the cause of the aggregate is one of the\nindividuals in it. But all of those individuals are caused to exist by\nother things in the aggregate, so no one individual is qualified to be\nthe cause of the existence of the entire aggregate. The only remaining\noption is that the existence of the aggregate has a cause external to\nthe aggregate. Because all of the contingently existing things are in\nthe aggregate, the cause must be a necessarily existing thing (Mayer\n2001). Avicenna is fully aware that the argument shouldn’t end\nhere, since it must be shown that the necessarily existing thing is\nGod, and he provides a number of considerations in favor of this claim\n(Adamson 2013). \nAvicenna’s cosmological argument from the contingency of the\nworld contrasts with another major type of argument for God’s\nexistence in Islamic natural theology, one that aims to demonstrate\nthe existence of God from the beginning of the world in time.\nAl-Ghazali (1056-1111), in The Incoherence of the\nPhilosophers, develops this type of argument in two steps. The\nfirst aims to establish, against a prominent Aristotelian tradition,\nthat the world is not eternal but has a beginning in time. The second\nstep reasons that for any being that begins to exist at a time, there\nmust be something that determines that it comes to exist at that time.\nAnd thus, because the world begins to exist at a time, there must be\nsomething which determines that it comes to exist at that time. As\nal-Ghazali puts it, “every being which begins has a cause for\nits beginning; now the world is a being which begins; therefore, it\npossesses a cause for its beginning.” He then argues that it\nmust be God who by free choice determines that the world comes to\nexist at the time it does, and we can thus conclude that God exists.\nThese argumentative themes are characteristic features of the\nAsh’arite theological tradition in Islam; in recent times,\nal-Ghazali’s argument has been defended by William Lane Craig\n(1979). \nLeibniz’s cosmological argument (Leibniz 1697 [PE]:\n149–55; 1714 [PP]: 646, [PE]: 218–19) does not assume or\nattempt to establish that the world, the collection of all actual\ncontingent beings, has a beginning in time, and in this respect it\nmore closely resembles Avicenna’s argument than\nal-Ghazali’s. Leibniz argues as follows: suppose that in fact\nthe world has no beginning in time, and that each being in the world\nhas an explanation in some previously existing being(s). Two demands\nfor explanation might still arise: Why is there a world at all rather\nthan none? and: Why does this world exist and not some other world?\nNeither explanation can be provided by appealing solely to entities\nwithin the world (or within time). Leibniz’s conclusion is that\nthere must be a being that is not merely hypothetically, but\nabsolutely necessary, and whose own explanation is contained\nwithin itself. This being is God. (A similar cosmological argument is\nadvanced around the same time by Samuel Clarke (1705), see also the\nentry on\n Samuel Clarke). \nDavid Hume puts forward three main objections to the type of\ncosmological argument offered by Leibniz and Clarke (Hume 1779, Part\nIX, and the entry\n Hume on religion).\n The first is that the notion of (absolutely) necessary existence\nitself is problematic. Suppose that some being is absolutely\nnecessary—then its nonexistence should be absolutely\ninconceivable. But, says Hume, for any being whose existence we can\nconceive, we can also conceive its nonexistence, and thus it\nisn’t a necessary being. Hume anticipates the objection that if\nwe truly understood the divine nature, we would be unable to conceive\nGod’s nonexistence. He replies that an analogous point can be\nmade about matter: for all we know, if we truly understood the nature\nof matter, we would be unable to conceive its nonexistence. This would\nshow that the existence of matter is not contingent after all, and\nthat it does not require an external explanation. Thus, by parity, the\ncosmological argument does not establish that God is the necessary\nbeing who is responsible for the rest of the cosmos. \nHume’s second objection is that God cannot be the causal\nexplanation of the existence of a series of contingent beings that has\nno temporal beginning, since any causal relation “implies a\npriority in time and a beginning of existence” (Hume 1779, Part\nIV). In reply, it seems quite possible to conceive of a non-temporal\ncausal relation, and thus to conceive of God, from outside of time,\ncausing a series of contingent beings that has always existed. Indeed,\nthis view is common in the theological tradition. Moreover, as Kant\nalong with numerous contemporary metaphysicians argue, we can\ncoherently conceive of a relation of simultaneous causation.\nIf this is right, then even a God who is in time could ground the\nexistence of a series of contingent beings with no temporal beginning.\n \nHume’s third objection is that in a causal series of contingent\nbeings without a temporal beginning, each being will have a causal\nexplanation by virtue of its predecessors. Since there is no first\nbeing, there will be a causal explanation for every contingent being\non the basis of previously existing contingent beings. However, if\neach individual contingent being has a causal explanation, then the\nentire causal series has an explanation. For wholes are nothing over\nand above their parts: \ndid I show you the particular causes of each individual in a\ncollection of twenty particles of matter, I should think it very\nunreasonable should you afterwards ask me what was the cause of the\nwhole twenty. (Part IV)  \nA reply to this last objection might be that even if one has explained\nin this way the existence of each individual in the contingent series,\none still has not answered the two questions mentioned earlier: Why is\nthere a world at all rather than none? and: Why does this world exist\nand not some other world? (for further discussion, see Rowe 1975;\nSwinburne 2004; Pruss 2006; O’Connor 2008). \nKant, too, objects to the cosmological argument, but mainly on the\ngrounds that it delivers an object that is inadequate to the classical\nconception of God. Any effort to turn the ultimate ground into the\nmost perfect of all beings, Kant says, will have to smuggle in some\nsort of ontological argument (see Pasternack 2001; Forgie 2003; Proops\n2014; and the entry on\n Kant’s philosophy of religion). \nIn general, objections to the cosmological argument (both historical\nand contemporary) take one of the following forms: \nThe Greek word “telos” means “end” or\n“purpose”. The a posteriori arguments in natural\ntheology that are referred to as “teleological” claim that\nthe natural world displays some sort of purposive or end-directed\ndesign, and that this licenses the conclusion that the natural world\nhas a very powerful and intelligent designer (see the entry on\n teleological arguments for God’s existence).\n Earlier authors dubbed this sort of non-demonstrative, inductive\nargument a “physico-theological” argument (see, e.g.,\nWilliam Derham 1713).  \nTeleological arguments can be found in numerous traditions and time\nperiods, including the classical Greek and Roman context (see Sedley\n2008) and the Indian philosophical tradition (see Brown 2008). In the\nwest the argument is primarily associated with William Paley\n(1743–1805), although in fact this type of argument was\ndiscussed by numerous early modern figures before him (see Taliaferro\n2005, DeCruz and DeSmedt 2015). The fact that Paley’s 1802 book\nwas called Natural Theology is no doubt part of why natural\ntheology as a whole is sometimes equated with the a\nposteriori investigations of nature for the purposes of\nsupporting religious theses. In the analogy that made Paley’s\nargument famous, the relationship between a watch and a watch-maker is\ntaken to be saliently similar to the relationship between the natural\nworld and its author. If we were to go walking upon the heath and\nstumble upon a watch, a quick examination of its inner workings would\nreveal, with a high probability, that “its several parts were\nframed and put together for a purpose” by what must have been\n“an intelligence” (1802: 1–6). Likewise with the\nuniverse as a whole. \nA different kind of teleological argument is developed by George\nBerkeley (1685–1753), for whom natural, physical objects do not\nexist independently of minds, but consist solely in ideas. Given the\nregularity, complexity, and involuntariness of our sensory ideas,\ntheir source (Berkeley argues) must be an infinitely powerful,\nbenevolent mind that produces these ideas in us in a lawlike fashion.\nGod’s existence can also be demonstrated from the harmony and\nbeauty that the ideas of the world display (Berkeley 1710: §146).\nSince according to Berkeley our ordinary experience is a type of\ndirect divine communication with us, our relationship with God is in\nthis respect especially intimate. Thus he frequently remarks, quoting\nSt. Paul, that “in God we live and move and have our\nbeing” (Acts 17:28). \nHume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion pre-date\nPaley, of course, but they feature an especially influential and\nelegant critical discussion of teleological arguments (1779), a\ndiscussion of which Paley was no doubt aware. (In fact, Paley may have\nrestyled his argument as an inference-to-best explanation in an effort\nto avoid some of Hume’s criticisms.) \nHume’s assault on the teleological argument begins by\nformulating it as follows (compare Pereboom 1996, 2010): \nHume’s objections to this argument include the claims that the\nanalogies on which it is dependent are not exact, and thus that there\nare alternative explanations for order and apparent design in the\nuniverse. One response to these objections is that the teleological\nargument should be conceived as an argument to the best\nexplanation, on the model of many scientific arguments. In that case\nthe analogy need not be exact, but might still show that a theistic\nexplanation is best (and again, Paley himself may have recognized\nthis). Hume, in the voice of his character Philo, concedes \nthat the works of nature bear a great analogy to the productions of\nart is evident; and according to all the rules of good reasoning, we\nought to infer, if we argue at all concerning them, that their causes\nhave a proportional analogy. (Part XII) \nBut Philo also affirms that we cannot infer any important similarities\nbetween humans and the author of nature beyond intelligence, and in\nparticular we cannot infer some of the divine attributes that are most\nimportant for sustaining traditional theistic religion (Part V). Most\nsignificantly, given the evil that there is in the universe, we cannot\nconclude that its designer has the moral qualities traditional\nreligion requires God to have (Part X). Thus, again, we are left with\na rather “mediocre deity”. \nOne of Hume’s neglected objections to the teleological argument\nis that it generates an absurd infinite regress (Part IV). If order\nand apparent design in the material universe are explained by divine\nintelligence, what explains the order and apparent design that give\nrise to intelligence in the divine mind? By dint of the reasoning\nemployed in the teleological argument, it would have to be a\nsuper-divine intelligence. But what explains the order and apparent\ndesign that give rise to super-divine intelligence? An absurd infinite\nregress results, and to avoid it one might well suppose the material\nworld “contain[s] the principle of order within itself”.\n \nTo this Hume has the theist Cleanthes reply that \neven in common life, if I assign a cause for any event, is it any\nobjection that I cannot assign the cause of that cause, and answer\nevery new question which may incessantly be started? \nThis seems right: in scientific theorizing it is no decisive objection\nagainst an explanation that it contains entities that are themselves\nnot fully explained. Crucial to the value of scientific explanations\nis that they supply an explanatory advance, and we can\nreasonably believe that a theory does so without our having in hand\ncomplete explanations for all of the entities it posits.  \nIn recent decades, some natural theologians have developed an\ninductive argument for the existence of God that appeals to the fact\nthat the fundamental features of the universe are fine-tuned for the\nexistence of life. According to many physicists, the fact that the\nuniverse can support life depends delicately on various of its\nfundamental characteristics, notably the values of certain constants\nof nature, the specific character of certain fundamental laws, and\naspects of the universe’s conditions in its very early stages.\nThe core claim of the argument is that without an intelligent\ndesigner, it would be improbable that the constants, laws, and initial\nconditions were fine-tuned for life. \nWilliam Lane Craig (see e.g., Craig 1990, 2003) develops a version of\nthis argument, which proceeds as follows. The world is conditioned\nprincipally by the values of the fundamental constants: \nWhen one imagines these constants being different, one discovers that\nin fact the number of observable universes, that is to say, universes\ncapable of supporting intelligent life, is very small. Just a slight\nvariation in any one of these values would render life impossible. For\nexample, if the strong force (as) were increased as much as\n1%, nuclear resonance levels would be so altered that almost all\ncarbon would be burned into oxygen; an increase of 2% would preclude\nformation of protons out of quarks, preventing the existence of atoms.\nFurthermore, weakening the strong force by as much as 5% would unbind\ndeuteron, which is essential to stellar nucleosynthesis, leading to a\nuniverse composed only of hydrogen. It has been estimated that the\nstrong force must be within 0.8 and 1.2 its actual strength or all\nelements of atomic weight greater than four would not have formed. Or\nagain, if the weak force had been appreciably stronger, then the Big\nBang’s nuclear burning would have proceeded past helium to iron,\nmaking fusion-powered stars impossible. But if it had been much\nweaker, then we should have had a universe entirely of helium. Or\nagain, if gravitation aG had been a little greater, all stars\nwould have been red dwarfs, which are too cold to support life-bearing\nplanets. If it had been a little smaller, the universe would have been\ncomposed exclusively of blue giants, which burn too briefly for life\nto develop. This gives us reason to believe that there is an\nintelligent designer who fine-tuned the universe as we actually find\nit. \nThe debate surrounding the fine-tuning argument is technically complex\n(a detailed summary is available in the entry on\n fine-tuning).\n Here we discuss some of the most pressing issues. \nAs noted, a core claim of the argument as widely understood is that\nthe fine-tuning for life of the constants, laws, and initial\nconditions would be deeply improbable without an intelligent designer\nof the universe. One question concerns the notion of probability at\nwork in this claim. Contemporary accounts usually appeal to an\nepistemic notion of probability (e.g., Monton 2006), by contrast with\nphysical and logical alternatives. On this reading, the core claim is\nthat fine-tuning for life without an intelligent designer is\nimprobable in the sense that we should not expect it without such a\nbeing, or that without such a being we should be surprised that there\nis such fine-tuning. \nGiven this understanding of the core improbability claim, some critics\n(e.g., Carlson and Olsson 1998) have argued that the fine-tuning at\nissue requires no explanation. Any specific sequence of heads and\ntails in a long series of coin tosses is improbable in this sense;\nthat is, any one sequence would be one we wouldn’t and\nshouldn’t expect. But no specific sequence requires an\nexplanation other than that it was randomly generated. So why should\nthe finely-tuned actual array of constants, laws, and initial\nconditions require an explanation other than an appeal to randomness?\nMany, however, disagree, and argue that the availability of\nexplanatory hypotheses with intuitive pull, such as an intelligent\ndesigner or a multiverse (discussed below), indicates that a more\nsubstantive explanation for fine-tuning is required (e.g., Leslie\n1989). \nA number of critics press the objection that we should not be\nsurprised that we observe features of the universe that are required\nfor our own existence. If the constants, laws, and initial conditions\nwere incompatible with our existence, we would not be here to observe\nthis. In Elliot Sober’s (2003) analysis, what’s at work\nhere is the observer selection effect, which tends to result in a\ncertain bias. In this case, our observations are biased toward\nfine-tuning because we would not have existed to make these\nobservations had the universe not been fine-tuned for life. But any\nbias resulting from an observer selection effect should be factored\nout and set aside, and this is so for the fine-tuning at issue. \nCritics of this line of reasoning cite examples in which it appears to\ngoes awry. In John Leslie’s (1989) example, you are dragged\nbefore a firing squad of 100 trained marksmen. The command is given;\nyou hear the deafening sound of the guns. But then there you are,\nsurprised to be observing the aftermath, and that you are still alive.\nNow consider the hypothesis that the marksmen intended to miss, which\nseems a reasonable option for explaining why you’re still alive.\nBut notice that this case features an observation selection effect\nanalogous to the one Sober proposes for fine-tuning: you can’t\nobserve the aftermath unless you survive the firing squad. On\nSober’s recommendation, observation selection effects should be\nfactored out and set aside. But on this recommendation your still\nbeing alive wouldn’t require an explanation, and we\nwouldn’t have reason to accept the explanation that the marksmen\nintended to miss. So, according to the critics, there must be\nsomething wrong with Sober’s analysis. \nLeslie (1989) proposes that the hypothesis of multiple universes,\ni.e., of the multiverse, would provide an explanation for fine-tuning\nfor life. Here is his analogy (which involves guns again, oddly). You\nare alone at night in an extremely dark forest when a gun is fired\nfrom far away and you are hit. If you assume that there is no one out\nto get you, this would be surprising. But now suppose that you were\nnot in fact alone, but instead part of a large crowd (which you do not\nsee because it’s so dark). In that case, Leslie suggests, you\nwould be less surprised at being shot, since it seems at least\nsomewhat likely that a gunman would be trying to shoot someone in the\ncrowd. Leslie suggests that this story supports the multiverse\nexplanation for the universe being fine-tuned for life. \nRoger White (2000) contends that there is a problem with\nLeslie’s account. While the multiverse hypothesis would explain\nwhy there is some universe or other that is fine-tuned for\nlife, since it would raise the probability of that hypothesis, it\nwould not similarly explain why this universe is fine-tuned for\nlife. He contends that supposing that the gunman was firing at\nrandom, being part of a large crowd explains—raises the\nprobability—that someone or other is shot, but\nnot that you are shot. By contrast, the hypothesis that the\ngunman was aiming at you, as opposed to firing at random, does explain\nin this way that you are shot. Similarly, the multiverse hypothesis\nexplains that there is some universe or other that is fine-tuned\nfor life, but not that this universe is fine-tuned for\nlife. By contrast, in White’s view the hypothesis of an\nintelligent designer does explain why—raises the\nprobability—that this universe is fine-tuned for life. White\nargues: \nPostulate as many other universes as you wish, they do not make it any\nmore likely that ours should be life-permitting or that we should be\nhere. So our good fortune to exist in a life-permitting universe gives\nus no reason to suppose that there are many universes (White 2000:\n274; see Rota 2005 for another theistic response to the multiverse\nhypothesis). \nArguments for the existence of God from a special kind of experience\nare often called “arguments from religious experience”.\nSome philosophers and theologians have argued that our ordinary human\ncognitive faculties include what John Calvin called a special\n“sense of divinity” that, when not impeded or blocked,\nwill deliver immediately justified beliefs about supernatural entities\n(Plantinga 1981, 1984). Some such thinkers, then, might construe an\nargument from religious experience as belonging to the category of\nnatural religion or natural theology. Others, however, insist that\n“characteristic of the Continental Calvinist tradition is a\nrevulsion against arguments in favor of theism or Christianity”\n(Wolterstorff 1984: 7; see also Sudduth 2009). In any case, most\nauthors who write about religious experience generally construe it as\ncaused by something other than our ordinary faculties and their\nintersubjectively available objects, and thus do not think of it as\none of the topics of natural theology (see Davis 1989, Alston 1991,\nKwan 2006). \nSee the entry on\n religious experience\n for expansive discussion of this issue. \nSome supporters of natural religion or natural theology seek to use\nour ordinary cognitive faculties to support theses that are more\nrobust and specific than those of generic or\n“perfect-being” theism. This project has recently been\ndubbed “ramified” natural theology by Richard Swinburne\n(see Holder 2013). A few of these efforts involve a priori\nargumentation: an ancient argument for the Trinity (found in St.\nAugustine (De Trinitate, c. 399–419, Book IX), and\nRichard of St. Victor (De Trinitate, c. 1162–1173,\nIII.1–25)) is that any supreme being would have to be a\nsupremely loving being, and any omnipotent supremely loving being\nwould ultimately have to emanate from itself something that is both\nother and yet just as supreme and lovable as itself, and that a third\nsuch person would be necessary as a kind of product of that love\nbetween the first two. Marilyn McCord Adams’s books on theodicy\n(Adams 2000, 2006) and Eleonore Stump’s Gifford Lectures (Stump\n2010) constitute an effort to consider the a priori problem\nof evil from within the context of a ramified (and thus in this case\nmore robustly Christian) kind of natural theology. \nBut most ramified natural theology is inductive in spirit: thus Hugo\nGrotius divides his De veritate religionis Christianae (1627)\ninto a first book that deals with classical natural theology but then\nlater books that deal specifically with the truth of Christianity.\nJohn Locke (1695) argued for the “Reasonableness of\nChristianity” using a broadly historical, probabilistic\napproach. William Paley (1794) further developed this approach, and\nmuch more recently Swinburne argued for the conclusion that\nBayesian-style reasoning justifies belief in the resurrection of Jesus\nwith a probability of 97% (Swinburne 2003). Numerous other\nphilosophers (and also many natural scientists) appeal to historical\nand scientific data as well as empirical and statistical principles of\nreasoning to support the authenticity of various biblical claims, the\nprobability of various miracle stories, and so forth (see e.g., Olding\n1990; Polkinghorne 2009; Gauch Jr. 2011). Note that this is a way of\nappealing to the content of sacred texts and special revelation which\nis consistent with the methods of natural theology: the prophetic or\nhistorical claims of those texts are evaluated using public evidence\nand accepted canons of inductive reasoning. Still, even optimistic\nnatural theologians like Locke, Paley, Swinburne, and these others\ncount as hybridists insofar as they think there are some important\ndoctrines about the divine that cannot be justified by our natural\ncognitive faculties. Thus even they will at some point be willing (in\nKant’s famous phrase) to “deny knowledge in order to leave\nroom for faith” (1787, Bxxx).","contact.mail":"chignell@princeton.edu","contact.domain":"princeton.edu"},{"date.published":"2015-07-06","date.changed":"2020-07-17","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-theology/","author1":"Andrew Chignell","author1.info":"http://www.chignell.net","author2.info":"http://derk-pereboom.net/","entry":"natural-theology","body.text":"\n\n\nThe term “natural religion” is sometimes taken to refer to\na pantheistic doctrine according to which nature itself is\ndivine. “Natural theology”, by contrast, originally\nreferred to (and still sometimes refers\n to)[1]\n the project of arguing for the existence of God on the basis of\nobserved natural facts. \n\n\nIn contemporary philosophy, however, both “natural\nreligion” and “natural theology” typically refer to\nthe project of using all of the cognitive faculties that are\n“natural” to human beings—reason, sense-perception,\nintrospection—to investigate religious or theological matters.\nNatural religion or theology, on the present understanding, is not\nlimited to empirical inquiry into nature, and it is not wedded to a\npantheistic result. It does, however, avoid appeals to special\nnon-natural faculties (ESP, telepathy, mystical experience) or\nsupernatural sources of information (sacred texts, revealed theology,\ncreedal authorities, direct supernatural communication). In general,\nnatural religion or theology (hereafter “natural\ntheology”) aims to adhere to the same standards of rational\ninvestigation as other philosophical and scientific enterprises, and\nis subject to the same methods of evaluation and critique. Natural\ntheology is typically contrasted with “revealed theology”,\nwhere the latter explicitly appeals to special revelations such as\nmiracles, scriptures, and divinely-superintended commentaries and\ncreedal formulations. (See DeCruz and DeSmedt 2015)\n\n\nPhilosophers and religious thinkers across almost every epoch and\ntradition (Near Eastern, African, Asian, and European) have engaged\nthe project of natural theology, either as proponents or critics. The\nquestion of whether natural theology is a viable project is at the\nroot of some of the deepest religious divisions: Shi’ite\nthinkers are optimistic about reason’s ability to prove various\ntheological and ethical truths, for instance, while Sunnis are not;\nRoman Catholic theologians typically think that reason provides\ndemonstrations of the existence of God, while many Protestant\ntheologians do not. Unlike most of the topics discussed in an\nencyclopedia of philosophy, this is one over which wars have been\nfought and throats have been cut.\n\n\nThe most active discussions of natural theology in the West occurred\nduring the high medieval period (roughly 1100–1400 C.E.) and the\nearly modern period (1600–1800 C.E.). The past few decades have\nwitnessed a revival of natural theological debate in the public\nsphere: there are now institutes promoting “Intelligent Design\nTheory”, popular apologetics courses, campus debates between\nbelievers and agnostics, a “New Atheist” movement, Youtube\ndebates between apologists and atheists regarding new books in natural\ntheology (such as the one between Nathan Lewis and Bernie Dehler on\nthe Blackwell Companion to Natural\n Theology),[2]\n and TED talks by famous atheists on how to resist natural religion\n(such as the one by Richard Dawkins in February\n 2002).[3]\n \n\n\nAmong professional philosophers (who aren’t typically part of\nthese more popular debates), arguments over our ability to justify\npositive or negative answers to religious questions have become fairly\ntechnical, often employing sophisticated logical techniques in an\neffort to advance the discussion instead of retreading the same old\nground. The prestigious Gifford Lectures series hosted by a consortium\nof Scottish universities, however, has tried to feature new but still\naccessible work in natural theology for over 100 years (it too has a\nYoutube\n channel!)[4]\n \n\nIn this article, we aim to avoid most the more recent complexities but\nalso explain their origins by focusing on some central developments in\nthe early modern period that helped to frame contemporary natural\ntheological debates. We are focused here only on theoretical\narguments (both a priori and a posteriori or\nempirical ones). It is controversial whether moral arguments\nare also part of natural theology, but we set them aside here (see\nalso the entry on\n God, arguments for the existence of: moral arguments).\n \nTheologians often follow Immanuel Kant’s example and address\nvarious “prolegomena” or preliminary questions before\ntrying to do any substantive metaphysics. These include questions\nabout the nature of religious language and about whether or not we are\nin principle able to access and understand religious truths. \nAgain, we will use the term “natural theologian” to refer\nto someone who aims to use ordinary human cognitive faculties (reason,\nsense-perception, introspection) to establish positive truths about\nthe existence and nature of God and other religiously significant,\nsupersensible beings or states of affairs. Such a person presupposes\nthat sentences in human language (or at least sentences in the\nlanguage of human thought) can express some theological truths, even\nif other such truths are beyond us. \nCritics of natural theology sometimes challenge these semantic\npresuppositions. They provide reasons to think that our thoughts,\nconcepts, or sentences are incapable of expressing theological truths,\nbecause they are incapable of referring adequately to the transcendent\nentities that play an important role in many religious\ndoctrines—entities such as Judaism’s YHWH,\nNeo-Platonism’s One, Vedanta’s Brahman, Mormonism’s\nHeavenly Father, and so on. The debate surrounding these issues is\noften designated “the problem of religious language”, but\nit is usually as much about human concepts as it is about\nsentences in natural languages.  \nIn the western tradition, there have been a few periods of especially\nactive discussion of these prolegomenal issues. The Neo-Platonic era\nwas one (see the discussion of negative theology in the entry on\n Plotinus),\n the high medieval period (1100–1400 or so) was another, the\nEnlightenment movement in 17th–18th\ncentury Europe (especially the empiricist portion of it) was a third.\nMore recent discussions have involved both analytic and continental\nfigures: A.J. Ayer, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, Antony\nFlew, Norman Malcolm, Emmanuel Levinas, and William P. Alston have\neach discussed, in very different ways, the question of whether and\nhow our language might succeed in referring to transcendent entities.\nHowever, since the 1970s, analytic philosophers have turned away from\na focus on language to a revival of metaphysics, and the\n“problem of religious language” has been much less\nprominent. \nIn addition to questions about what religious language refers to and\nhow (if at all) religious concepts apply, the natural\ntheologian faces another set of preliminary questions about our\nability to generate sound arguments about such entities or\nfacts. Our sense-perceptual and rational faculties are clearly limited\nand fallible. There are presumably many facts about the natural\nuniverse that we are incapable of grasping due to their complexity or\ninaccessibility. So why should we think that our natural faculties can\ndeliver truths about even more remote or transcendent entities?  \nA related debate concerns whether natural theology is the only method\nby which we can have access to the domain of truths about\nsupersensible realities of religious interests. Some practitioners\n(call them rationalists) argue that only propositions that can\nbe justified by unaided human reason are candidates for permissible\nbelief. Others (call them hybridists) allow that our natural\nfaculties can take us a certain distance—to knowledge of the\nbasic nature and even existence of God, say—but argue that we\nmust ultimately appeal to revelation and faith when it comes\nto more specific doctrines regarding the divine nature, acts, and\nintentions. This is the canonical Roman Catholic position on faith and\nreason developed in authors such as Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, and\nrevived in the natural scientific context of the Renaissance by\nCatalan scholar Raymond Sebond (1385–1436). Sebond’s Latin\nwork, Theologia Naturalis (1434–1436), became famous\nwhen Michel de Montaigne translated it into French in 1569 and made it\nthe subject of the longest of his renowned Essays\n(‘Apology for Raymond Sebond’), in 1580. \nThere are many kinds of hybridists: while they all think a turn to\nfaith is necessary at some point, some seek to establish little more\nthan the bare existence of God before turning to faith for greater\ndetails. Others think it is possible to develop a more robust\nunderstanding of God from within the bounds of reason and\nsense-perception. Indeed, in recent years the so-called\n“ramified natural theology” movement has sought to use our\nnatural faculties to demonstrate (or show to be highly probable)\nrobust doctrines that go well beyond bare theism—for example,\nspecifically Christian doctrines such as that of the Trinity, the\nresurrection, or the historical authenticity of certain miracles or\nbiblical prophecies (Swinburne 2003; Newman et al. 2003; Gauch Jr.\n2011; see\n section 4 below).\n  \nOpponents of natural religion or theology, by contrast, deny\nthat reason and our other ordinary perceptual capacities can justify\nreligious beliefs. Some of these opponents are fideists (e.g.,\non some readings, Tertullian, Blaise Pascal, Pierre Bayle, J.G.\nHamann, F.H. Jacobi, and Søren Kierkegaard) who hold these same\nbeliefs as articles of faith rather than as teachings of reason (see\nthe entry on\n fideism).\n Pascal, for instance, was a preeminent mathematician with strong\ninterests in natural theology, but ultimately concluded (during what\nhe called a “night of fire” in November 1654) that unaided\nreason is more likely to lead us to the false god “of\nphilosophers and scholars” than to the true “God of\nAbraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob”. The 20th\ncentury Reformed theologian Karl Barth opposed natural theology for\nmuch the same reason, and made his opposition to Emil Brunner’s\nversion of the hybridist project clear in a book titled simply\n“Nein!” (Barth 1934). In his Gifford Lectures\n(which were endowed by Lord Gifford to be a lecture series about\nnatural theology), contemporary theologian Stanley Hauerwas espouses a\nfideistic view in the tradition of Pascal and Barth but claims\n(somewhat perversely) that his project (which incorporates biblical\ntexts and specifically Christian doctrines) counts as “natural\ntheology” all the same (Hauerwas 2001: 15ff). \nOther opponents of natural theology are agnostics who do not\nfind the fideist’s turn to faith appealing. They deny that our\nnatural faculties succeed in justifying any positive or negative\nsubstantial (i.e., non-analytic) theistic beliefs, and consequently\nsuspend belief. Agnostics differ, however, as to whether unaided\nreason could in principle but does not in fact\njustify such beliefs (thus Bertrand Russell’s famous response to\na question about what he would say if he were to die and then confront\nGod on judgment day: “not enough evidence, God, not enough\nevidence!”), or whether our unaided faculties are not even\nin principle adequate to the task.  \nStill other opponents of natural theology are atheists.\nAtheists agree with fideists and agnostics that our natural faculties\ncannot establish the existence of God or other religious entities. But\nthat’s because they think those faculties provide reasons to\nbelieve that such entities do not exist at all (see the entry on\n atheism and agnosticism).\n One such reason is the negative one that we cannot produce any sound\narguments for theistic claims. But atheists also often maintain that\nthere are positive reasons to believe that God does not\nexist—the incoherence of the concept of God, for instance, or\nthe incompatibility of God’s existence and the existence of\nhorrendous suffering and evil (see the entry on the problem of\n evil). \nThere are many ways to approach a survey of natural theology. Here we\nhave chosen to focus largely on the classic historical discussions,\nand in particular on the debates in the medieval and Enlightenment\n(17th–18th century) periods in the west.\nWe will consider versions of the two basic kinds of positive argument\nin favor of religious theses: a priori arguments and a\nposteriori arguments. There are species of each of these. \nA priori arguments are those that do not require an appeal to\nparticular sense-perceptual experiences in order to justify their\nconclusions. Immanuel Kant gave the name\n“ontological” to a priori arguments that aim to\nprove the existence of an object from a concept or an idea of that\nobject (see the entry on\n ontological arguments).\n But the argument over whether such a strategy can establish the\nexistence of God began well before Kant’s time. \nAn early and now-canonical formulation of the ontological argument is\nfound in the second book of St. Anselm’s Proslogion\n(Anselm 1077–78). Anselm begins by characterizing God as the\n“being than which none greater can be thought” and then\nseeks to show that such a being does and indeed must exist.  \nAnselm’s argument can be reconstructed in various ways (see the\nentry on\n Saint Anselm),\n but here is one: \nIn support of (2), Anselm notes that \n[T]he fool has said in his heart that “There is no God”.\nBut when this same Fool hears me say “something than which\nnothing greater can be thought”, he surely understands what he\nhears; and what he understands exists in his understanding, even if he\ndoes not understand that it exists [in reality]. (Anselm\n81–2) \nSo according to Anselm, even the “foolish” atheist\nunderstands the term “God” when he argues that\nGod does not exist. By this Anselm simply means that the atheist has\nthe idea of God, and thus has God “in his\nunderstanding”. \nPremise (4) presupposes that things can exist in a number of different\nways or modes. One of those ways is as the object of an\nidea—i.e., existence “in the understanding”. Another\nway for it to exist is “in reality”. (4) articulates a\ncomparative value judgment about these ways of existing: it is\ngreater for something to exist in both ways than it\nis to exist merely in the first way.  \nIn order to deduce (5) from (3) and (4), Anselm uses a reductio ad\nabsurdum argument: \nAnd surely that than which a greater cannot be thought cannot exist\nonly in the understanding. For if it exists only in the understanding,\nit can be thought to exist in reality as well, which is greater.\n(Anselm 82) \nMore explicitly: \nPhilosophers and theologians have made numerous efforts to revive or\ndemolish Anselm’s argument over the centuries. The most\ninfluential proponents include René Descartes, Gottfried\nLeibniz, Charles Hartshorne, Norman Malcolm, Robert M. Adams, and\nAlvin Plantinga. Its main detractors include Anselm’s\ncontemporaneous interlocutor—a monk named Gaunilo—as well\nas Thomas Aquinas, Descartes’ correspondents Johannes Caterus,\nMarin Mersenne, and Antoine Arnauld, Immanuel Kant, and, more\nrecently, David Lewis (1970), Peter van Inwagen (1977), and Graham\nOppy (1996, 2009). In what follows, a number of the relevant moves in\nthe early modern discussion will be considered, as well as some\ncontemporary developments of the 17th century modal\nargument. \nDescartes’ ontological argument, first presented in the Fifth\nMeditation, aims to prove the existence of God from the idea of God\n(Descartes 1641, cited below from the edition by Adam and Tannery\n(1962–1976) and referred to as “AT”). Here is one\nway to formulate the argument (compare Pereboom 1996, 2010; for\nalternatives see the entry on\n Descartes’ Ontological Argument): \nOne prominent way of resisting this argument is to reduce it to\nabsurdity by appeal to “parity of reasoning”. Johannes\nCaterus, for instance, objected to Descartes that by a precisely\nparallel form of reasoning we could prove the real existence of the\nobject of an idea of an existent lion (AT 7.99). Gaunilo’s reply\nto Anselm centuries earlier was similar: by parity of reasoning, one\ncan prove the existence in reality (and not just in the understanding)\nof the maximally perfect island (Anselm 102). \nThe objection aims to show that, like the idea God, the idea of the\nexistent lion and the idea of the maximally perfect island include\nexistence, and thus the existence of these objects can be established\nvia an ontological argument. But the claim that the existence of\nCaterus’s lion and Gaunilo’s island can be established in\nthis way is absurd, and thus the same holds for the theistic\nontological argument. Note that this parity argument via a\nreductio ad absurdum, if successful, would show that the\nontological argument is unsound, but without indicating which step in\nthe reasoning is at fault. \nA second objection, anticipated by Descartes in the Fifth Meditation,\nis that truly predicating a property of something without specifying\nany conditions or intentional contexts involves an affirmation that\nthe thing exists. So from the truth of “Macron is the President\nof France”, one can conclude that Macron exists. As a result,\n“Pegasus is a winged horse” is strictly speaking false,\nthough by using the intentional context “according to the\nmyth” we can say, truly, “According to the myth, Pegasus\nis a winged horse”. This suggests that premise (3) above is\nsubject to a decisive challenge, and Descartes can legitimately claim\nonly, for instance “According to the idea of God, God has all\nperfections”, or “If God exists, then God has all\nperfections”. But then all that follows in step (6) is the\nunspectacular conclusion that “According to the idea of God, God\nexists”, or, even less impressively, “If God exists, then\nGod exists”.  \nA third problem, raised in the Second Objections by Father Marin\nMersenne, is that the argument would be sound only if a maximally\nperfect being is really possible, or, equivalently, only if there is a\ngenuine divine essence. But this, Mersenne complains, has not been\nestablished (AT 7.127). (Side note: Gaunilo and Mersenne are good\nexamples of how devout theists might still take issue with natural\ntheological efforts to prove God’s existence.) \nDescartes’ reply to these objections involves the notion of a\n“true and immutable nature” (“TIN”) (AT\n7.101ff.). Only some of our ideas of things that have TINs. Moreover,\nTINs themselves exist in some way, although they need not exist in\nconcrete or empirical reality. Perhaps they are abstract objects, like\nnumbers or sets (Descartes explicitly compares them to Plato’s\nForms). In any case, the kind of existence TINs have is sufficient to\nundermine the second objection above: the divine\nessence—God’s nature—is a true and\nimmutable nature, and thus we do not need to prefix anything like the\nphrase “According to the idea of God” to premise (3).\nRather, Descartes thinks we can clearly and distinctly perceive that\nGod’s nature is a TIN, and that this TIN contains all\nperfections. Thus we can conclude that “God has all\nperfections”. That would make the inference to (6) a valid one.\n \nDescartes’ challenge, then, is to show that God’s nature\nis a TIN and that the natures of an “existent lion” and\n“the maximally perfect island” are not TINs. In the Fifth\nMeditation Descartes maintains that TINs are different from fictitious\nideas in that TINs are in some sense independent of the thought of\ntheir conceivers. For example, the nature of a triangle is a TIN\nbecause it contains properties that we don’t grasp when we first\nform the idea of a triangle, and deducing these further properties is\na process “more like discovery than creation”. God’s\nnature also has this feature—we obviously don’t grasp all\nof the properties of the maximally perfect being when we first form an\nidea of it. The problem, however, is that it is not clear how this\ncriterion would rule out the natures of a most perfect island or an\nexistent lion as TINs, since in those cases we also don’t grasp\nall of the properties when we first form the idea.  \nLater, Descartes (AT 7.83–4) characterizes a TIN as having a\nunity such that it cannot be divided by the intellect. He thinks that\nhaving this feature shows that is hasn’t been simply put\ntogether by the intellect or imagination, and is thus a genuine\nnature. Accordingly, the idea of an existent lion does not correspond\nto a TIN because I can coherently conceive of a lion that\ndoesn’t exist. Likewise I can coherently conceive of a maximally\nperfect island having one fewer coconut tree but one more mango tree,\nand so on. But it also seems that I can conceive of some of the divine\nperfections without others (i.e. of an omnipotent being that is\nlacking maximal benevolence). So by this standard it appears that the\nidea of God also fails to correspond to a true and immutable nature.\nNote: Descartes himself seems to resist this objection by arguing that\nall of the divine perfections ultimately boil down to sovereignty or\nomnipotence.  \nTo the third problem, concerning the real possibility of God,\nDescartes replies that our clear and distinct ideas of\nTINs—produced in us by reason—are reliable. Since we can\n(supposedly) see clearly and distinctly that there is no contradiction\nin our idea of God’s nature, the denial that God is really\npossible is on equal footing with the denial that the angles of a\ntriangle are equal to two right angles (AT 7.150–1). \nLeibniz addresses several of the central objections to\nDescartes’ ontological argument (in, e.g., Leibniz 1676 [PP]:\n167–8; 1677 [PP]: 177–80; 1684 [PP]: 292–3; 1692\n[PP]: 386; 1678 [PE]: 237–39; 1699 [PE]: 287–88; Adams\n1994: 135–56). These include: \nIn several places Leibniz addresses (A) by arguing that by\n“God” we understand a necessary being, and that from this\nit follows that the essence of God involves necessary existence. In\nthis way we supposedly avoid altogether the premise that existence is\na perfection. (One wonders, however, whether the argument for\nincluding “necessary existence” in the idea of God will\nneed to rely on the premise that necessary existence is a\nperfection.) \nIn some writings Leibniz tries to bypass (B) by presenting an argument\nwith a different conditional as its conclusion (see Adams 1994:\n135–42): \nWhat has yet to be dealt with, clearly, is Mersenne’s problem\nabove—(C), that the real possibility of a most perfect being\ncannot be demonstrated. Leibniz offers several types of arguments\nagainst this. One relies on the fact that other things are\nclearly possible, together with the claim that only a necessary being\nprovides a satisfactory ground or explanation for the possible\nexistence of contingent beings. So on the assumption that contingent\nbeings possibly exist, it must be at least possible for God, as a\nnecessary being, to exist (for more on this kind of argument from\npossibility, see section 2.3 below).  \nA second type of Leibnizian argument for God’s real possibility\nreturns to the thesis that God is the most perfect being, and adds\nthat perfections are positive and simple, unanalyzable qualities. So,\nfor example, consider any proposition of the form “A\nand B are incompatible”, where A and\nB are any two perfections. Two properties are incompatible\nonly if they are logically incompatible, according to Leibniz. Thus\n“A and B are incompatible” will be true\nonly if one of these perfections turns out to be the negation of the\nother (as in omniscient and non-omniscient), or if\ntheir analyses reveal simpler properties, one of which is a negation\nof another. But on the assumption that all the divine perfections are\npositive, simple, and thus unanalyzable, neither of these scenarios\ncan obtain. Consequently, “A and B are\ncompatible” is always true for any two perfections, and thus a\nbeing with all perfections is really possible (Leibniz 1678 [PE]:\n238–39; Adams 1994: 142–48).  \nA third Leibnizean response to Mersenne’s objection is that it\nis rational to presume the real possibility of the things we\ncan conceive, at least until their impossibility has been\ndemonstrated. \nKant’s most famous criticism of the ontological argument is\nencapsulated in his claim that “existence” (or\n“exists”) is not a positive determination or “real\npredicate” (Kant 1781/1787: A592/B619ff). Alternatively,\n“existence” is not “a predicate that is added to the\nconcept of the subject and enlarges it” (A598/B626; see Stang\n2016 and Pasternack 2018 for discussion). Kant’s idea here is\nthat since “existence” is not a real predicate, existing\ncannot be one of God’s perfections.  \nOne way to interpret the objection is as follows: \n(4) is the key premise in this formulation—does coming into\nexistence involve a genuine change? There is clearly a technical sense\nin which saying that a concept applies to something does not enlarge\nthe concept or change our conception of the being it refers to. But it\nmight remain open that a being that has all perfections but does not\nexist is not as great as a being that has all perfections and also\nexists. \nKant’s objection can perhaps be avoided altogether by proposing\nthat the perfection at issue is necessary existence, and not\nmere existence. Adding necessary existence to our concept of\na being would presumably involve changing it (and thus enlarging its\nconcept). This is effectively a modal version of the ontological\nargument (see\n section 2.1.5). \nKant’s most pressing criticism, in our view, goes back to the\nissue raised by Mersenne: we cannot determine whether God (conceived\nas having necessary existence or not) is really possible. Kant grants\nto Leibniz that the notion of a most perfect being may not involve a\nlogical contradiction, but he argues that this is not enough to show\nthat it is really possible, for there are ways of being impossible\nthat do not involve logical contradictions (A602/B630). The\nimplication for the ontological argument is that we cannot know or\nrationally presume that it is really possible for the divine\nperfections to be jointly exemplified even if we know that they\ninvolve no contradiction. \nFor how can my reason presume to know how the highest realities\noperate, what effects would arise from them, and what sort of relation\nall these realities would have to each other? (Kant LPT [AK\n28:1025–26]) \nVersions of the ontological argument discussed by Leibniz and Kant\nhave been elaborated by Robert M. Adams (1971), Alvin Plantinga\n(1979), Peter van Inwagen (1977, 2009) and others. These versions\nemploy contemporary modal semantics and metaphysics to motivate the\nfollowing two assumptions: \nThe argument then proceeds as follows: \nCritics have resisted numerous aspects of the argument (for\ncomprehensive discussion, see Oppy 1996). The inference to (7), for\ninstance, assumes that the actual world is possible relative\nto w*. But that assumption is only legitimate on some models\nof how talk of modality (i.e. of possibility and necessity) works.\nThus, the critic claims, it hasn’t been shown that w*\nhas the relation to the actual world that licenses the conclusion that\nGod actually exists. \nThe most significant disagreement, however, is again the one that\nMersenne raised against Descartes. How can the claim about\nmetaphysical possibility in (1) be justified? Adams (1994: ch.8),\nfollowing Leibniz, claims that we are rationally permitted, in the\nabsence of strong reasons to the contrary, to presume the\nreal possibility of most things, including God. Others argue that no\nsuch presumption of metaphysical possibility is justified, especially\nregarding supersensible things. \nLeibniz’s argument for God’s existence from the existence\nof the necessary truths crucially involves the premises that all\ntruths are true in virtue of something distinct from them (they need\nwhat contemporary metaphysicans sometimes call a\n“truth-maker”). Since necessary truths would be true even\nif there were no finite minds to think them, such truths cannot be\ntrue in virtue of facts about human psychology. Against the Platonic\nsuggestion that they are true in virtue of Forms existing outside of\nany mind whatsoever, Leibniz argues that some of the truths are about\nabstract entities, which are not the kinds of things that could have\nmind-independent existence. The only contender that remains, then, is\nthat these truths are true in virtue of the ideas in an infinite and\nnecessarily existent (divine) mind (Leibniz 1714 [PP]: 647; Adams\n1994: 177ff.). \nLeibniz’s argument stakes out one position on the grounding of\nnecessary truths, but there are many rival views that do not invoke\nthe existence of a necessary and eternal divine mind. A Platonist\nmight respond by claiming that it hasn’t been shown that\nabstract entities do not have mind-independent existence, while\nHumeans would argue that necessary truths are all analytic, and that\ntherefore only the structure of language or of our conceptual schemes\nis required to ground their truth. \nA third sort of a priori proof argues from facts about the\nmere possibility of something (or of some collection of things) to the\nexistence of a “ground of possibility” that somehow\nexplains them. An early version of such an argument can be found in\nAugustine and the Neo-Platonic tradition, but the canonical\npresentations of this sort of “possibility proof” are in\nLeibniz’s Monadology (1714) and, much more elaborately,\nin Kant’s book-length treatise called The Only Possible\nBasis for a Demonstration of the Existence of God (1763). Note\nthat if truths about what is possible are necessary truths, as they\nindeed seem to be, then this might be a more specific version of the\nargument from necessary truths (see\n 2.2). \nKant’s version of the argument is based on the claim that there\nare real possibilities that are not grounded in the principle of\nnon-contradiction, but that nevertheless must have a ground or\nexplanation (Kant 1763 [AK 2: 63ff]). If they are not grounded in the\nprinciple of non-contradiction, then they are not grounded in\nGod’s thinking them rather than their negations, which is how\nLeibniz had proposed that all such possibilities are grounded. Put the\nother way around, Kant thinks that some impossibilities are\ngrounded not in the law of non-contradiction, but in a\nnon-logical kind of “real repugnance” between two or more\nof their properties. Kant maintains, for instance, that it is\nimpossible for a material being to be conscious, even though no\nlogical contradiction exists between material and\nconscious (Kant 1763 [AK 2: 85–6]). It follows that\nthis impossibility is not grounded in divine thought, for God can\nthink any proposition that does not involve a contradiction. So facts\nabout some real possibilities and real impossibilities can only be\ngrounded in a necessary being that somehow exemplifies\n(rather than merely thinking) every combination of fundamental\nproperties whose joint exemplification is really possible. That being,\nof course, is supposed to be God. (For discussion, see Fisher and\nWatkins 1998; Adams 2000; Chignell 2009, 2012, 2014; Stang 2010; Abaci\n2014; Yong 2014; Hoffer 2016; Abaci 2019; Oberst 2018, 2020). \nOne way out of this argument is simply to claim that some real\npossibilities are primitive or ungrounded. This appears to be an\noption for Kant in his critical period insofar as he is no longer\ncommitted to rationalist principles such as the Principle of\nSufficient Reason (see Abaci 2019). Still, even in his critical period\n(i.e., after 1770 or so), Kant never repudiated the earlier\nproof—and supposedly claimed in a lecture from the 1780s that it\n“can in no way be refuted” (Kant LPT [AK 28: 1034]). This\nsuggests that in his critical period Kant still held that God’s\nexistence is the only available ground for real possibility, but that\nthe explanatory point may justify at most a kind of theoretical belief\n(Glaube) rather than full demonstrative knowledge (see\nChignell 2009, Stang 2016, and Oberst 2020). \nAn a posteriori argument involves at least one premise whose\njustification essentially appeals to some sort of empirical fact or\nexperience. The main demonstrative a posteriori argument is\nwhat Kant dubbed “the cosmological argument”. It is\nmotivated by the familiar question “Why is there something\nrather than nothing?” and goes from the empirical fact of the\nexistence of something (or of the cosmos as a whole, perhaps) to the\nexistence of a first cause or ground of that cosmos that is, at least\nin part, not identical to that cosmos. Cosmological arguments are\nfound across almost every philosophical tradition, and find prominence\nin the West in the writings of Aristotle, Avicenna,\nal-Gh&amacr;z&amacr;li, Maimonides, Aquinas, Locke, Leibniz, Samuel\nClarke, and David Hume. Here we will start with Avicenna, but then\nfocus largely on the early modern period. \nAvicenna (980–1037), whose Arabic name is Ibn Sina, sets out\ncosmological arguments in a number of works, but a detailed version is\nfound in his Remarks and Admonitions (Kitab al-Isharat wa\nl-Tanbihat) (Avicenna [ISR]; Mayer 2001). He begins with a claim\nabout contingently existing things: since it is possible for a\ncontingent thing either to exist or not to exist, whether it exists or\nnot hangs in the balance. But then, if a contingent thing does exist,\nthere must be something external to it, a cause, that accounts for its\nexisting rather than not. This establishes a principle crucial to the\nargument: “the existence of every contingent is from other than\nit.” \nAvicenna next considers the aggregate of all the existing contingent\nindividual things, the existence of each of which is accounted for by\nits causal antecedents. He then proposes and evaluates four options\nfor accounting for the aggregate’s existence. The first is that\nthe existence of the aggregate does not require a cause. However,\ngiven the principle that the existence of any contingent thing must\nhave a cause, the aggregate would then have to exist necessarily. But\nthe aggregate’s existing necessarily is ruled out by the fact\nthat all of the individuals in it are contingent things. On the second\noption, the cause of the existence of the aggregate is “the\nindividuals all together.” But then the aggregate would cause\nitself to exist, which is ruled out by the principle that the\nexistence of any contingent thing requires a cause other than it. The\nthird option is that the cause of the aggregate is one of the\nindividuals in it. But all of those individuals are caused to exist by\nother things in the aggregate, so no one individual is qualified to be\nthe cause of the existence of the entire aggregate. The only remaining\noption is that the existence of the aggregate has a cause external to\nthe aggregate. Because all of the contingently existing things are in\nthe aggregate, the cause must be a necessarily existing thing (Mayer\n2001). Avicenna is fully aware that the argument shouldn’t end\nhere, since it must be shown that the necessarily existing thing is\nGod, and he provides a number of considerations in favor of this claim\n(Adamson 2013). \nAvicenna’s cosmological argument from the contingency of the\nworld contrasts with another major type of argument for God’s\nexistence in Islamic natural theology, one that aims to demonstrate\nthe existence of God from the beginning of the world in time.\nAl-Ghazali (1056-1111), in The Incoherence of the\nPhilosophers, develops this type of argument in two steps. The\nfirst aims to establish, against a prominent Aristotelian tradition,\nthat the world is not eternal but has a beginning in time. The second\nstep reasons that for any being that begins to exist at a time, there\nmust be something that determines that it comes to exist at that time.\nAnd thus, because the world begins to exist at a time, there must be\nsomething which determines that it comes to exist at that time. As\nal-Ghazali puts it, “every being which begins has a cause for\nits beginning; now the world is a being which begins; therefore, it\npossesses a cause for its beginning.” He then argues that it\nmust be God who by free choice determines that the world comes to\nexist at the time it does, and we can thus conclude that God exists.\nThese argumentative themes are characteristic features of the\nAsh’arite theological tradition in Islam; in recent times,\nal-Ghazali’s argument has been defended by William Lane Craig\n(1979). \nLeibniz’s cosmological argument (Leibniz 1697 [PE]:\n149–55; 1714 [PP]: 646, [PE]: 218–19) does not assume or\nattempt to establish that the world, the collection of all actual\ncontingent beings, has a beginning in time, and in this respect it\nmore closely resembles Avicenna’s argument than\nal-Ghazali’s. Leibniz argues as follows: suppose that in fact\nthe world has no beginning in time, and that each being in the world\nhas an explanation in some previously existing being(s). Two demands\nfor explanation might still arise: Why is there a world at all rather\nthan none? and: Why does this world exist and not some other world?\nNeither explanation can be provided by appealing solely to entities\nwithin the world (or within time). Leibniz’s conclusion is that\nthere must be a being that is not merely hypothetically, but\nabsolutely necessary, and whose own explanation is contained\nwithin itself. This being is God. (A similar cosmological argument is\nadvanced around the same time by Samuel Clarke (1705), see also the\nentry on\n Samuel Clarke). \nDavid Hume puts forward three main objections to the type of\ncosmological argument offered by Leibniz and Clarke (Hume 1779, Part\nIX, and the entry\n Hume on religion).\n The first is that the notion of (absolutely) necessary existence\nitself is problematic. Suppose that some being is absolutely\nnecessary—then its nonexistence should be absolutely\ninconceivable. But, says Hume, for any being whose existence we can\nconceive, we can also conceive its nonexistence, and thus it\nisn’t a necessary being. Hume anticipates the objection that if\nwe truly understood the divine nature, we would be unable to conceive\nGod’s nonexistence. He replies that an analogous point can be\nmade about matter: for all we know, if we truly understood the nature\nof matter, we would be unable to conceive its nonexistence. This would\nshow that the existence of matter is not contingent after all, and\nthat it does not require an external explanation. Thus, by parity, the\ncosmological argument does not establish that God is the necessary\nbeing who is responsible for the rest of the cosmos. \nHume’s second objection is that God cannot be the causal\nexplanation of the existence of a series of contingent beings that has\nno temporal beginning, since any causal relation “implies a\npriority in time and a beginning of existence” (Hume 1779, Part\nIV). In reply, it seems quite possible to conceive of a non-temporal\ncausal relation, and thus to conceive of God, from outside of time,\ncausing a series of contingent beings that has always existed. Indeed,\nthis view is common in the theological tradition. Moreover, as Kant\nalong with numerous contemporary metaphysicians argue, we can\ncoherently conceive of a relation of simultaneous causation.\nIf this is right, then even a God who is in time could ground the\nexistence of a series of contingent beings with no temporal beginning.\n \nHume’s third objection is that in a causal series of contingent\nbeings without a temporal beginning, each being will have a causal\nexplanation by virtue of its predecessors. Since there is no first\nbeing, there will be a causal explanation for every contingent being\non the basis of previously existing contingent beings. However, if\neach individual contingent being has a causal explanation, then the\nentire causal series has an explanation. For wholes are nothing over\nand above their parts: \ndid I show you the particular causes of each individual in a\ncollection of twenty particles of matter, I should think it very\nunreasonable should you afterwards ask me what was the cause of the\nwhole twenty. (Part IV)  \nA reply to this last objection might be that even if one has explained\nin this way the existence of each individual in the contingent series,\none still has not answered the two questions mentioned earlier: Why is\nthere a world at all rather than none? and: Why does this world exist\nand not some other world? (for further discussion, see Rowe 1975;\nSwinburne 2004; Pruss 2006; O’Connor 2008). \nKant, too, objects to the cosmological argument, but mainly on the\ngrounds that it delivers an object that is inadequate to the classical\nconception of God. Any effort to turn the ultimate ground into the\nmost perfect of all beings, Kant says, will have to smuggle in some\nsort of ontological argument (see Pasternack 2001; Forgie 2003; Proops\n2014; and the entry on\n Kant’s philosophy of religion). \nIn general, objections to the cosmological argument (both historical\nand contemporary) take one of the following forms: \nThe Greek word “telos” means “end” or\n“purpose”. The a posteriori arguments in natural\ntheology that are referred to as “teleological” claim that\nthe natural world displays some sort of purposive or end-directed\ndesign, and that this licenses the conclusion that the natural world\nhas a very powerful and intelligent designer (see the entry on\n teleological arguments for God’s existence).\n Earlier authors dubbed this sort of non-demonstrative, inductive\nargument a “physico-theological” argument (see, e.g.,\nWilliam Derham 1713).  \nTeleological arguments can be found in numerous traditions and time\nperiods, including the classical Greek and Roman context (see Sedley\n2008) and the Indian philosophical tradition (see Brown 2008). In the\nwest the argument is primarily associated with William Paley\n(1743–1805), although in fact this type of argument was\ndiscussed by numerous early modern figures before him (see Taliaferro\n2005, DeCruz and DeSmedt 2015). The fact that Paley’s 1802 book\nwas called Natural Theology is no doubt part of why natural\ntheology as a whole is sometimes equated with the a\nposteriori investigations of nature for the purposes of\nsupporting religious theses. In the analogy that made Paley’s\nargument famous, the relationship between a watch and a watch-maker is\ntaken to be saliently similar to the relationship between the natural\nworld and its author. If we were to go walking upon the heath and\nstumble upon a watch, a quick examination of its inner workings would\nreveal, with a high probability, that “its several parts were\nframed and put together for a purpose” by what must have been\n“an intelligence” (1802: 1–6). Likewise with the\nuniverse as a whole. \nA different kind of teleological argument is developed by George\nBerkeley (1685–1753), for whom natural, physical objects do not\nexist independently of minds, but consist solely in ideas. Given the\nregularity, complexity, and involuntariness of our sensory ideas,\ntheir source (Berkeley argues) must be an infinitely powerful,\nbenevolent mind that produces these ideas in us in a lawlike fashion.\nGod’s existence can also be demonstrated from the harmony and\nbeauty that the ideas of the world display (Berkeley 1710: §146).\nSince according to Berkeley our ordinary experience is a type of\ndirect divine communication with us, our relationship with God is in\nthis respect especially intimate. Thus he frequently remarks, quoting\nSt. Paul, that “in God we live and move and have our\nbeing” (Acts 17:28). \nHume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion pre-date\nPaley, of course, but they feature an especially influential and\nelegant critical discussion of teleological arguments (1779), a\ndiscussion of which Paley was no doubt aware. (In fact, Paley may have\nrestyled his argument as an inference-to-best explanation in an effort\nto avoid some of Hume’s criticisms.) \nHume’s assault on the teleological argument begins by\nformulating it as follows (compare Pereboom 1996, 2010): \nHume’s objections to this argument include the claims that the\nanalogies on which it is dependent are not exact, and thus that there\nare alternative explanations for order and apparent design in the\nuniverse. One response to these objections is that the teleological\nargument should be conceived as an argument to the best\nexplanation, on the model of many scientific arguments. In that case\nthe analogy need not be exact, but might still show that a theistic\nexplanation is best (and again, Paley himself may have recognized\nthis). Hume, in the voice of his character Philo, concedes \nthat the works of nature bear a great analogy to the productions of\nart is evident; and according to all the rules of good reasoning, we\nought to infer, if we argue at all concerning them, that their causes\nhave a proportional analogy. (Part XII) \nBut Philo also affirms that we cannot infer any important similarities\nbetween humans and the author of nature beyond intelligence, and in\nparticular we cannot infer some of the divine attributes that are most\nimportant for sustaining traditional theistic religion (Part V). Most\nsignificantly, given the evil that there is in the universe, we cannot\nconclude that its designer has the moral qualities traditional\nreligion requires God to have (Part X). Thus, again, we are left with\na rather “mediocre deity”. \nOne of Hume’s neglected objections to the teleological argument\nis that it generates an absurd infinite regress (Part IV). If order\nand apparent design in the material universe are explained by divine\nintelligence, what explains the order and apparent design that give\nrise to intelligence in the divine mind? By dint of the reasoning\nemployed in the teleological argument, it would have to be a\nsuper-divine intelligence. But what explains the order and apparent\ndesign that give rise to super-divine intelligence? An absurd infinite\nregress results, and to avoid it one might well suppose the material\nworld “contain[s] the principle of order within itself”.\n \nTo this Hume has the theist Cleanthes reply that \neven in common life, if I assign a cause for any event, is it any\nobjection that I cannot assign the cause of that cause, and answer\nevery new question which may incessantly be started? \nThis seems right: in scientific theorizing it is no decisive objection\nagainst an explanation that it contains entities that are themselves\nnot fully explained. Crucial to the value of scientific explanations\nis that they supply an explanatory advance, and we can\nreasonably believe that a theory does so without our having in hand\ncomplete explanations for all of the entities it posits.  \nIn recent decades, some natural theologians have developed an\ninductive argument for the existence of God that appeals to the fact\nthat the fundamental features of the universe are fine-tuned for the\nexistence of life. According to many physicists, the fact that the\nuniverse can support life depends delicately on various of its\nfundamental characteristics, notably the values of certain constants\nof nature, the specific character of certain fundamental laws, and\naspects of the universe’s conditions in its very early stages.\nThe core claim of the argument is that without an intelligent\ndesigner, it would be improbable that the constants, laws, and initial\nconditions were fine-tuned for life. \nWilliam Lane Craig (see e.g., Craig 1990, 2003) develops a version of\nthis argument, which proceeds as follows. The world is conditioned\nprincipally by the values of the fundamental constants: \nWhen one imagines these constants being different, one discovers that\nin fact the number of observable universes, that is to say, universes\ncapable of supporting intelligent life, is very small. Just a slight\nvariation in any one of these values would render life impossible. For\nexample, if the strong force (as) were increased as much as\n1%, nuclear resonance levels would be so altered that almost all\ncarbon would be burned into oxygen; an increase of 2% would preclude\nformation of protons out of quarks, preventing the existence of atoms.\nFurthermore, weakening the strong force by as much as 5% would unbind\ndeuteron, which is essential to stellar nucleosynthesis, leading to a\nuniverse composed only of hydrogen. It has been estimated that the\nstrong force must be within 0.8 and 1.2 its actual strength or all\nelements of atomic weight greater than four would not have formed. Or\nagain, if the weak force had been appreciably stronger, then the Big\nBang’s nuclear burning would have proceeded past helium to iron,\nmaking fusion-powered stars impossible. But if it had been much\nweaker, then we should have had a universe entirely of helium. Or\nagain, if gravitation aG had been a little greater, all stars\nwould have been red dwarfs, which are too cold to support life-bearing\nplanets. If it had been a little smaller, the universe would have been\ncomposed exclusively of blue giants, which burn too briefly for life\nto develop. This gives us reason to believe that there is an\nintelligent designer who fine-tuned the universe as we actually find\nit. \nThe debate surrounding the fine-tuning argument is technically complex\n(a detailed summary is available in the entry on\n fine-tuning).\n Here we discuss some of the most pressing issues. \nAs noted, a core claim of the argument as widely understood is that\nthe fine-tuning for life of the constants, laws, and initial\nconditions would be deeply improbable without an intelligent designer\nof the universe. One question concerns the notion of probability at\nwork in this claim. Contemporary accounts usually appeal to an\nepistemic notion of probability (e.g., Monton 2006), by contrast with\nphysical and logical alternatives. On this reading, the core claim is\nthat fine-tuning for life without an intelligent designer is\nimprobable in the sense that we should not expect it without such a\nbeing, or that without such a being we should be surprised that there\nis such fine-tuning. \nGiven this understanding of the core improbability claim, some critics\n(e.g., Carlson and Olsson 1998) have argued that the fine-tuning at\nissue requires no explanation. Any specific sequence of heads and\ntails in a long series of coin tosses is improbable in this sense;\nthat is, any one sequence would be one we wouldn’t and\nshouldn’t expect. But no specific sequence requires an\nexplanation other than that it was randomly generated. So why should\nthe finely-tuned actual array of constants, laws, and initial\nconditions require an explanation other than an appeal to randomness?\nMany, however, disagree, and argue that the availability of\nexplanatory hypotheses with intuitive pull, such as an intelligent\ndesigner or a multiverse (discussed below), indicates that a more\nsubstantive explanation for fine-tuning is required (e.g., Leslie\n1989). \nA number of critics press the objection that we should not be\nsurprised that we observe features of the universe that are required\nfor our own existence. If the constants, laws, and initial conditions\nwere incompatible with our existence, we would not be here to observe\nthis. In Elliot Sober’s (2003) analysis, what’s at work\nhere is the observer selection effect, which tends to result in a\ncertain bias. In this case, our observations are biased toward\nfine-tuning because we would not have existed to make these\nobservations had the universe not been fine-tuned for life. But any\nbias resulting from an observer selection effect should be factored\nout and set aside, and this is so for the fine-tuning at issue. \nCritics of this line of reasoning cite examples in which it appears to\ngoes awry. In John Leslie’s (1989) example, you are dragged\nbefore a firing squad of 100 trained marksmen. The command is given;\nyou hear the deafening sound of the guns. But then there you are,\nsurprised to be observing the aftermath, and that you are still alive.\nNow consider the hypothesis that the marksmen intended to miss, which\nseems a reasonable option for explaining why you’re still alive.\nBut notice that this case features an observation selection effect\nanalogous to the one Sober proposes for fine-tuning: you can’t\nobserve the aftermath unless you survive the firing squad. On\nSober’s recommendation, observation selection effects should be\nfactored out and set aside. But on this recommendation your still\nbeing alive wouldn’t require an explanation, and we\nwouldn’t have reason to accept the explanation that the marksmen\nintended to miss. So, according to the critics, there must be\nsomething wrong with Sober’s analysis. \nLeslie (1989) proposes that the hypothesis of multiple universes,\ni.e., of the multiverse, would provide an explanation for fine-tuning\nfor life. Here is his analogy (which involves guns again, oddly). You\nare alone at night in an extremely dark forest when a gun is fired\nfrom far away and you are hit. If you assume that there is no one out\nto get you, this would be surprising. But now suppose that you were\nnot in fact alone, but instead part of a large crowd (which you do not\nsee because it’s so dark). In that case, Leslie suggests, you\nwould be less surprised at being shot, since it seems at least\nsomewhat likely that a gunman would be trying to shoot someone in the\ncrowd. Leslie suggests that this story supports the multiverse\nexplanation for the universe being fine-tuned for life. \nRoger White (2000) contends that there is a problem with\nLeslie’s account. While the multiverse hypothesis would explain\nwhy there is some universe or other that is fine-tuned for\nlife, since it would raise the probability of that hypothesis, it\nwould not similarly explain why this universe is fine-tuned for\nlife. He contends that supposing that the gunman was firing at\nrandom, being part of a large crowd explains—raises the\nprobability—that someone or other is shot, but\nnot that you are shot. By contrast, the hypothesis that the\ngunman was aiming at you, as opposed to firing at random, does explain\nin this way that you are shot. Similarly, the multiverse hypothesis\nexplains that there is some universe or other that is fine-tuned\nfor life, but not that this universe is fine-tuned for\nlife. By contrast, in White’s view the hypothesis of an\nintelligent designer does explain why—raises the\nprobability—that this universe is fine-tuned for life. White\nargues: \nPostulate as many other universes as you wish, they do not make it any\nmore likely that ours should be life-permitting or that we should be\nhere. So our good fortune to exist in a life-permitting universe gives\nus no reason to suppose that there are many universes (White 2000:\n274; see Rota 2005 for another theistic response to the multiverse\nhypothesis). \nArguments for the existence of God from a special kind of experience\nare often called “arguments from religious experience”.\nSome philosophers and theologians have argued that our ordinary human\ncognitive faculties include what John Calvin called a special\n“sense of divinity” that, when not impeded or blocked,\nwill deliver immediately justified beliefs about supernatural entities\n(Plantinga 1981, 1984). Some such thinkers, then, might construe an\nargument from religious experience as belonging to the category of\nnatural religion or natural theology. Others, however, insist that\n“characteristic of the Continental Calvinist tradition is a\nrevulsion against arguments in favor of theism or Christianity”\n(Wolterstorff 1984: 7; see also Sudduth 2009). In any case, most\nauthors who write about religious experience generally construe it as\ncaused by something other than our ordinary faculties and their\nintersubjectively available objects, and thus do not think of it as\none of the topics of natural theology (see Davis 1989, Alston 1991,\nKwan 2006). \nSee the entry on\n religious experience\n for expansive discussion of this issue. \nSome supporters of natural religion or natural theology seek to use\nour ordinary cognitive faculties to support theses that are more\nrobust and specific than those of generic or\n“perfect-being” theism. This project has recently been\ndubbed “ramified” natural theology by Richard Swinburne\n(see Holder 2013). A few of these efforts involve a priori\nargumentation: an ancient argument for the Trinity (found in St.\nAugustine (De Trinitate, c. 399–419, Book IX), and\nRichard of St. Victor (De Trinitate, c. 1162–1173,\nIII.1–25)) is that any supreme being would have to be a\nsupremely loving being, and any omnipotent supremely loving being\nwould ultimately have to emanate from itself something that is both\nother and yet just as supreme and lovable as itself, and that a third\nsuch person would be necessary as a kind of product of that love\nbetween the first two. Marilyn McCord Adams’s books on theodicy\n(Adams 2000, 2006) and Eleonore Stump’s Gifford Lectures (Stump\n2010) constitute an effort to consider the a priori problem\nof evil from within the context of a ramified (and thus in this case\nmore robustly Christian) kind of natural theology. \nBut most ramified natural theology is inductive in spirit: thus Hugo\nGrotius divides his De veritate religionis Christianae (1627)\ninto a first book that deals with classical natural theology but then\nlater books that deal specifically with the truth of Christianity.\nJohn Locke (1695) argued for the “Reasonableness of\nChristianity” using a broadly historical, probabilistic\napproach. William Paley (1794) further developed this approach, and\nmuch more recently Swinburne argued for the conclusion that\nBayesian-style reasoning justifies belief in the resurrection of Jesus\nwith a probability of 97% (Swinburne 2003). Numerous other\nphilosophers (and also many natural scientists) appeal to historical\nand scientific data as well as empirical and statistical principles of\nreasoning to support the authenticity of various biblical claims, the\nprobability of various miracle stories, and so forth (see e.g., Olding\n1990; Polkinghorne 2009; Gauch Jr. 2011). Note that this is a way of\nappealing to the content of sacred texts and special revelation which\nis consistent with the methods of natural theology: the prophetic or\nhistorical claims of those texts are evaluated using public evidence\nand accepted canons of inductive reasoning. Still, even optimistic\nnatural theologians like Locke, Paley, Swinburne, and these others\ncount as hybridists insofar as they think there are some important\ndoctrines about the divine that cannot be justified by our natural\ncognitive faculties. Thus even they will at some point be willing (in\nKant’s famous phrase) to “deny knowledge in order to leave\nroom for faith” (1787, Bxxx).","contact.mail":"dp346@cornell.edu","contact.domain":"cornell.edu"}]
