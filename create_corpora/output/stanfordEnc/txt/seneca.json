He occupies a central place in the\nliterature on Stoicism at the time, and shapes the understanding of\nStoic thought that later generations were to have. Seneca’s\nphilosophical works played a large role in the revival of Stoic ideas\nin the Renaissance. Until today, many readers approach Stoic\nphilosophy through Seneca, rather than through the more fragmentary\nevidence that we have for earlier Stoics. Seneca’s writings are\nstunningly diverse in their generic range. More than that, Seneca\ndevelops further and shapes several philosophical genres, most\nimportant, the letter and so-called “consolations”; his\nessay On Mercy is considered the first example of what came\nto be known as the “mirror of the prince” literature.\n\n\nAfter several centuries of relative neglect, Seneca’s philosophy\nhas been rediscovered in the last few decades, in what might be called\na second revival of Senecan thought. In part, this renewed interest is\nthe result of a general reappraisal of Roman culture. It is also\nfuelled by major progress that has been made in our understanding of\nGreek Hellenistic philosophy, and by recent developments in\ncontemporary ethics, such as a renewed interest in the theory of\nemotions, roles and relationships, and the fellowship of all human\nbeings. And finally, some influential scholars have found, in the wake\nof Foucault’s reading of Seneca, that Seneca speaks to some\ndistinctively modern concerns.\n\nLucius Annaeus Seneca (c. 1 BCE – CE 65) was born in Corduba\n(Spain) and educated—in rhetoric and philosophy—in Rome.\nSeneca had a highly successful, and quite dramatic, political career.\nEven a brief (and by necessity incomplete) list of events in his life\nindicates that Seneca had ample occasion for reflection on violent\nemotions, the dangers of ambition, and the ways in which the life of\npolitics differs from the life of philosophy—among the topics\npursued in his writings. He was accused of adultery with the Emperor\nCaligula’s sister and therefore exiled to Corsica in 41; having\nbeen Nero’s “tutor” in his adolescent years, he was\namong Nero’s advisors after his accession in 54; Seneca\ncontinued to be an advisor in times that became increasingly difficult\nfor anyone in the close proximity of Nero, in spite of requests from\nhis side to be granted permission to retire; he was charged with\ncomplicity in the Pisonian conspiracy to murder Nero, and compelled to\ncommit suicide in 65 (on Seneca’s life, see Griffin 1992;\nMaurach 2000; Veyne 2003; Wilson 2014; Romm 2014; on his perspective\non Nero, see Braund 2009). \nSeneca’s philosophical writings have often been interpreted with\nan eye to his biography: how could his discussions of the healing\npowers of philosophy not reflect his own life? However, as personal as\nSeneca’s style often is, his writings are not autobiographical\n(Edwards 1997). Seneca creates a literary persona for himself. He\ndiscusses the questions that occupy him in a way that invites his\nreaders to think about issues in their own life, rather than in\nSeneca’s life. \nThe writings that we shall primarily be concerned with are: the\nMoral Letters to Lucilius (Ad Lucilium epistulae\nmorales), the Moral Essays\n(‘dialogi’ or dialogues is the somewhat\nmisleading title given in our principal manuscript, the Codex\nAmbrosianus, to the twelve books making up ten of these works,\nincluding three “consolatory” writings; among the\nEssays are two further works that came down to us in other\nmanuscripts), and the Natural Questions (Naturales\nquaestiones) (on the full range of Seneca’s writings, see\nVolk and Williams 2006, “Introduction,” and Ker 2006; a\ncomprehensive overview, with individual chapters on specific writings\nand themes, is offered in Heil and Damschen 2014). \nA brief note is in order here on the relative chronology of\nSeneca’s works, which is hard to establish given that we know so\nlittle about Seneca’s life apart from his imperial service, as\nnoted above, and its consequences. The Consolation to Marcia\nis probably the earliest surviving piece of Seneca’s work.\nSimilarly, the Consolation to His Mother Helvia and the\nConsolation to Polybius are considered early (perhaps dating\nto 43 or 44), the former actually being composed on the occasion of\nSeneca’s banishment to Corsica. All other surviving works seem\nto be written later, mostly after Seneca’s return to Rome in 49\nfrom his Corsican exile. Among the Moral Essays, the only one\nwe can date with some certainty is On Mercy, an essay in\nwhich Seneca directly addresses Nero in the early days of his reign\n(55 or 56). The Moral Letters to Lucilius as well as the\nNatural Questions are the product of the last years of\nSeneca’s life, the brief period (62–65) that Seneca spent\nin retirement before following Nero’s order to commit suicide\n(on the dating of Seneca’s writings see the introductions in\nCooper/Procopé 1995, and Griffin 1992). \nIn the Imperial Period, Stoicism had significant influence on Roman\nliterature, and Seneca’s tragedies are of particular interest\nhere. In Seneca’s case, we do not see a poet appropriating or\nintegrating Stoic ideas, but actually a Stoic philosopher writing\npoetry himself. The precise way in which Seneca’s Stoicism is\nrelevant to his tragedies is controversial. Traditionally scholars\ndebated whether and why a philosopher like Seneca would write poetry\nat all—to some this seemed so unlikely that prior to Erasmus it\nwas thought that there were two ‘Senecas,’ the philosopher\nand the tragedian (cf. Fantham 1982, 15). Today it is widely assumed\nthat some of the themes in Seneca’s tragedies are at least\nrelated to his philosophical views. Seneca’s interest in ethics\nand psychology—first and foremost perhaps the destructive\neffects of excessive emotion—seems to figure in his plays, and\nperhaps his natural philosophy plays an equally important role (cf.\nFantham 1982, 15–19; Fischer 2014; Gill 2003, 56–58;\nRosenmeyer 1989; Schiesaro 2003; Volk 2006; on the range of\nSeneca’s writings, see Volk and Williams 2006). In this article,\nwe do not consider his tragedies, but only his prose writings. Some\nrecent work on Seneca suggests that one should see his prose writings\nand his tragedies as complementary sides of his thought (Wray 2009).\nThe tragedies are arguably darker than the prose writings, and topics\non which Seneca seems to have a consoling philosophical view are\nexplored in rather less consoling ways. For example, death is seen as\na liberation in Seneca’s philosophical writings. But in the\ntragedies, death can appear as a transition to even greater\nsufferings, or, equally bad, the dead seem to demand ever new deaths,\nto provide them with fresh companions in the underworld (Busch\n2009). \nReaders who approach Seneca as students of ancient\nphilosophy—having acquired a certain idea of what philosophy\nis by studying Plato, Aristotle, or Chrysippus—often\nfeel at a loss. To them, Seneca’s writings can appear lengthy\nand merely admonitory. Partly, this reaction may reflect prejudices of\nour training. The remnants of a Hegelian (and Nietzschean, and\nHeideggerean) narrative for philosophy are deeply ingrained in\ninfluential works of scholarship. On this account, the history of\nancient philosophy is a history of decline, the Roman thinkers are\nmediocre imitators of their Greek predecessors, and so on (Long 2006;\nsee Griffin 2018 for a collection of Griffin’s work on politics and\nphilosophy in Rome). Such prejudices are hard to shake off; for many\ncenturies watered-down versions of them have shaped the way students\nlearnt Latin and Greek. In recent years, however, many scholars have\ncome to adopt a different view. They find in Seneca a subtle author\nwho speaks very directly to modern concerns of shaping ourselves and\nour lives. \nSeneca does not write as a philosopher who creates or expounds a\nphilosophical theory from the ground up. Rather, he writes within the\ntrack of an existing system that he is largely in agreement with. A\nreconstruction of Seneca’s philosophy, if it aimed at some kind\nof completeness, would have to be many-layered. At several points, it\nwould have to include accounts of earlier Stoic philosophy, and\ndiscuss which aspects of these earlier theories become more or less\nprominent in Seneca’s thought. At times Seneca’s own\ncontribution consists in developing further a Stoic theory and adding\ndetail to it. At other times, Seneca dismisses certain technicalities\nand emphasizes the therapeutic, practical side of philosophy. \nSeneca thinks of himself as the adherent of a philosophical\nsystem—Stoicism—and speaks in the first person plural\n(‘we’) in order to refer to the Stoics. Rather than call\nSeneca an orthodox Stoic, however, we might want to say that he writes\nwithin the Stoic system. Seneca emphasizes his independence\nas a thinker. He holds Stoic views, but he does not see himself as\nanyone’s disciple or chronicler. In On the Private\nLife, he says: “Surely you can only want me to be like my\nleaders? Well then, I shall not go where they send me but where they\nlead” (1.5, tr. Cooper and Procopé). Seneca sees himself\nas a philosopher like the older Stoics. He feels free, however, to\ndisagree with earlier Stoics, and is not concerned with keeping\nStoicism ‘pure’ from non-Stoic ideas. Seneca integrates\nideas from other philosophies if these seem helpful to him. As he\nexplains, he likes to think of philosophical views as if they were\nmotions made in a meeting. One often asks the proponent of the motion\nto split it up in two motions, so that one can agree with one half,\nand vote against the other (Letter 21.9). For example, Seneca\nthinks that there is something salutary in Platonic metaphysics\n(Boys-Stones 2013; Donini 1979, 179–199; Reydams-Schils 2010;\nSedley 2005; Setaioli 1988). While he dismisses the theory of Forms,\nhe still holds that studying it can make us better. It\nacquaints us with the thought that the things which stimulate and\nenflame the senses are not among the things that really are\n(Letter 58.18 and 26). Seneca also adopts metaphors or images\nthat are associated with other philosophical schools, such as\nPlatonically inspired images of the body as prison of the soul (e.g.,\nNQ I.4 and 11). But invoking such images need not commit\nSeneca to holding the theories in which they originate. \nAnother side of Seneca’s independence has been emphasized by\nInwood (2005 [1], 18–22): Seneca, educated by Roman\nphilosophers, is genuinely thinking in Latin. In order to see\nthe force of this point, let us compare Seneca to Cicero. Cicero\nconscientiously tells his readers which Greek term he translates by\nwhich Latin term. It is thus possible to read Cicero’s Latin\nphilosophy with the Greek terminology in mind; at least for the most\npart, we can think about his arguments in the terms of the Greek\ndebates. Seneca is, at many points, not interested in mapping his\nterminology directly onto the Greek philosophical vocabulary. Rather,\nhe thinks in his own language (see Long 2003, who situates Seneca\nvis-à-vis other Roman philosophers), and he expects to be read\nby people who do their philosophizing in Latin, as well. \nLike other late Stoics, Seneca is first and foremost interested in\nethics. Although he is well versed in the technical details of Stoic\nlogic, philosophy of language, epistemology, and ontology, he does not\ndevote any significant time to these fields (Barnes 1997, 12–23;\nCooper 2004). However, we should not let the old prejudices about\nRoman versus Greek thought influence our interpretation of\nSeneca’s interest in practical questions. As Veyne puts it,\n“Seneca practiced neither a debased nor a vulgarized philosophy\naimed at the supposed ‘practical spirit’ of the\nRomans” (2003, ix). Rather, it is Seneca’s very conception\nof philosophy as a salutary practice that makes the ethical dimension\nof his thought so prominent (on philosophy as therapy, see Nussbaum\n1994; Setaioli 2014). \nSeneca’s writings usually have an addressee—someone who is\nplagued by a ‘sickness of the soul’ (On Peace of\nMind begins with a full diagnosis of the addressee’s state\nof mind—first by the patient, and then by the insightful\ntherapist Seneca). Seneca steps back from a format in which a\nphilosopher justifies a theory in a step-by-step argument (Long 2003,\n204; on the question of why Seneca chooses to write letters, see\nInwood 2007, xiv-xv). Discussion proceeds from a (perhaps merely\npresumed) situation in the addressee’s life, meandering back and\nforth between more general and more specific considerations,\narguments, side-issues, and sometimes consolation (see Wildberger 2020\nfor the view that Seneca’s Letters involve the creation of\na persona who, over the course of the Letters, gains\nincreasing interest in technical questions in philosophy). This\nengaging style views the reader as a participant in philosophical\nthought (Roller 2015; Schafer 2011). Seneca thinks that in order to\nbenefit from philosophy, one cannot passively adopt insights. One must\nappropriate them as an active reader, thinking through the issues for\noneself, so as then to genuinely assent to them (Letter\n84.5–10; Wildberger 2006). \nIt has often been noted that later Stoics, including Seneca, seem to\nlose interest in the ideal agent—the sage or wise\nperson—who figures so prominently in early Stoic ethics. Rather\nthan assume that the later Stoics are disillusioned or more realistic,\nwe should note that Seneca’s focus on the progressor\n(proficiens)—the person who is seriously trying their\nbest to move forward in their way of life toward that ideal—is\npart and parcel of his own, specific way of doing philosophy. The\nearly Stoics’ sage may, first and foremost, be a tool for\ndeveloping theories. The early Stoics spell out what knowledge or\nwisdom is by explaining what a knowledgeable or wise person would do\n(how she assents, how she acts, etc.). But Seneca’s philosophy\nis a practice of training ourselves to appreciate to the fullest the\ntruths of Stoicism. In this practice, accounts of, for example, the\nwise person’s assent, can only play a limited role. We need\nprecisely what Seneca offers: someone who takes us through\nthe various situations in life in which we tend to lose sight of our\nown insights, and fall victim to the allurements of money and fame, or\nto the violence of emotions evoked by the adversities of life. We need\nto learn how to overcome our own residual tendencies, despite our\nbetter intentions, to suffer such failures. \nThree of Seneca’s writings bear the title\n‘consolatio’—consolation. They, too, are\nletters, and, as Williams argues, Seneca in them transforms the genre\nof philosophical consolation into his own mode of therapy (2006). In\nthe ad Heluiam (To His Mother Helvia), Seneca\nconsoles his mother for his absence and exile. Seneca uses his exile\nas a metaphor, and ultimately addresses what he takes to be a\nmany-faceted condition in human life: any kind of alienation from\none’s immediate community, any enforced detachment from it,\nraises the issues that political exile raises. As this example shows,\nhis consolations are thus rather independent of his particular\nsituation, and of the particular addressee. Still, we might want to\nnote that at times, in consoling his mother for his exile, or, in\nad Marciam (To Marcia), a woman for the loss of her\nchild, Seneca discusses virtue with a view to gender. In her life up\nto now, he tells his mother, she has moved beyond the ordinary faults\nof women; her virtue was her only ornament. In accordance with this,\nshe should now try not to fall into grief in the way women tend\nto—excessively. By holding on to virtue, it seems, his mother\ncan transcend what Seneca considers typical, yet merely contingent\nfeatures of female life. (On Seneca’s depiction of female\nvirtue, cf. ad Heluiam 14–18 and ad Marciam 1\nand 16; Harich 1993; Wilcox 2006). \nSeneca tells us that there is a much-debated choice between three\nkinds of life—the life of theory, the life of politics (or\npractice), and the life of pleasure. This is not a Stoic distinction.\nRather, it is (by Seneca’s time) a conventional division, going\nback, on the one hand, to Aristotle’s discussion of the life of\ntheoria (‘contemplation’) as compared to the life\nof politics, and on the other hand to Plato’s and\nAristotle’s engagement with prominent views about the good (the\ngood is pleasure, the good is honor, the good is wisdom). Seneca is\nnot committed to the view that the life of theory is a different life\nfrom the life of practice. But the Aristotelian way of framing the\nquestion helps him describe choices which he and some of his\naddressees face in life: whether to retire from an active role in\npolitics, or to single-mindedly pursue one’s political career\n(for a discussion of traditional interpretations, which aim to explain\nSeneca’s views on retirement in the context of his biography,\nsee Williams 2003). \nIn On the Private Life and in On Peace of Mind,\nSeneca addresses this very question of how to choose between the\nactive life of politics, and a life devoted to philosophy. The choice\nis, for Seneca, partly about the right kind of balance. How much do we\nneed to retreat in order to be at peace with ourselves? Philosophy has\ntwo functions. We need philosophical insight on which to base our\nactions. But we also need to devote time specifically to reflecting on\nsuch truths as that only virtue is good, and thus restore our peace of\nmind (cf. On Peace of Mind 2.4 for a description of\ntranquility). \nBoth philosophy and politics are spheres in which we can benefit\nothers (On Peace of Mind 3.1–3). The contrast between\nthe life of theory and the life of politics helps Seneca spell out his\nversion of Stoic cosmopolitanism. We should not think of the choice\nbetween philosophy and politics as a choice between theory and\npractice. Rather, philosophy and politics represent two worlds that we\nsimultaneously belong to. The world of politics is our local world;\nthe world of philosophy is the whole world. By pursuing an active\ncareer in politics, we aim to do good to the people in our vicinity.\nBy retreating into philosophy we choose to live, for a while,\npredominantly in the world at large (Wildberger 2018a). By studying,\nteaching, and writing philosophy, Seneca thinks, we help others who\nare not necessarily spatially close to us. Philosophical study is\nbeneficial (or ‘of benefit’), it is of use to others, in\nthe world-wide community to which we all belong (On the Private\nLife 3.4–4.2). \nWhile Seneca takes it for granted that cosmopolitanism is concerned\nwith the idea that it is good to benefit others, he does not seem to\nthink that cosmopolitanism burdens us with the unfeasible task of\nhelping everyone. Rather, cosmopolitanism liberates us. As things may\nplay out in our individual lives, we may be in a better position to\nbenefit others as philosophers than as Roman senators; and since both\nare good things to do, we can in fact be content with our lives either\nway. Cosmopolitanism creates a beneficial form of life that a narrower\npolitical picture may not accommodate: not only those who happen to be\nappreciated in their own states can benefit others (cf.\nLetter 68.2; cf. Williams 2003, 10–11 and 19–24).\nIn On the Private Life 3.5, Seneca says: “What is\nrequired, you see, of any man is that he should be of use to other\nmen—if possible, to many; failing that, to a few; failing that,\nto those nearest him; failing that, to himself.” \nIn Stoic philosophy, cosmopolitanism includes a view of the nature of\nhuman beings: human beings are, by virtue of the kind of beings they\nare, connected. Seneca at times explores fellowship among human beings\nin terms of family relationships. The family in a conventional sense\nis a place of ethical learning. Beyond this, there is an idealized and\nbroader familial relation among people and Seneca is open to the idea\nthat one chooses one’s intellectual ancestors independent of\nbiological relationships (Gloyn 2017). The Stoics see human beings as\nparts of a whole, namely as parts of the cosmos (Vogt 2008, chapter\n2). Seneca fully embraces this idea. In On Benefits, a\ntreatise concerned with beneficere as a social practice, but\nalso, more literally, with beneficere understood as\n‘doing good,’ Seneca asks in which ways God benefits human\nbeings. His answer aims to explain why, though we do not have the\nnatural weapons other animals have and are in many ways weaker than\nthey are, human beings have the kind of standing in the world he takes\nthem to have, the standing of “masters.” “God has\ngranted two things that make this vulnerable creature the strongest of\nall: reason and fellowship. […] Fellowship has given him power\nover all animals […] Remove fellowship and you will destroy the\nunity of mankind on which our life depends.” (tr. Griffin/Inwood\n2011, 4.18.2–3). Seneca’s focus on fellowship is in line\nwith earlier Stoic thought about affiliation\n(oikeiôsis) between human beings, as well as with the\nStoic view that the cosmos is a large animal with us as some of its\nparts. Ideally, human beings relate as friends to each other. On the\northodox Stoic conception of friendship, only wise and virtuous people\nare friends (Vogt 2008, 148–160). Seneca endorses this ambitious\nnotion of friendship. In order to be a friend, one must first attain a\nconsistent mindset (Letter 35.2 and 4, cf. Wildberger 2018b).\n \nThe two most prominent features of the Stoic account of the soul are\nthese: first, the soul is corporeal; second, the adult human soul is\nrational (in the sense that all its operations involve the\nuse of reason) and one (psychological monism). Although\nSeneca appreciates Platonic imagery that presents the soul as\n‘loftier’ than bodily things, he is fully committed to the\nStoic view that the soul is a body. Discussion of this issue is, to\nhis mind, somewhat academic, and thus not as salutary as the elevating\nthemes about virtue that he often prefers. But Letter 106\nexplains why we must think of the soul as a body. Only bodies\nact on anything, cause effects; therefore, the soul must be a\nbody (cf. Letter 117 on the good being a body). \nTraditionally, Stoic philosophy is considered to have three phases:\nearly (Zeno, Cleanthes, Chrysippus, et al.), middle (Panaetius,\nPosidonius, et al.), and late (Seneca, Epictetus, et al.). This\nperiodization importantly hangs on a possible development in the\nphilosophical psychology of the Stoics—the question of whether\nPanaetius and Posidonius move away from so-called psychological\nmonism. According to psychological monism, there is no non-rational\npart or power of the soul. Rather, the soul is one insofar as its\ncommanding faculty is one, and rational. According to psychological\nmonism, motivational conflict and irrational action do not result from\na ‘struggle’ between the rational and the non-rational\naspects of the soul; what we call irrational must be understood as\n(bad) states of the rational soul. Psychological monism is thus a\ncounterposition to Plato’s and Aristotle’s account of the\nsoul, and has major implications for the theory of action, ethics, and\nthe theory of emotion. It is a difficult question whether middle\nStoicism departs from psychological monism. The view that it did was\nfor a long time widely accepted. However, this traditional picture has\nrecently been contested in influential studies (Cooper 1999; Tieleman\n2003). Perhaps early and middle Stoicism are more in agreement than it\nwas previously thought. Accordingly, some recent studies of Seneca\nproceed on the assumption that we need not attempt to figure out\nwhether Roman Stoicism agrees with monistic early or with pluralistic\nmiddle Stoicism (Inwood 2005). \nBut Seneca may agree with psychological monism insofar as he does not\ndistinguish between rational and non-rational powers of the soul (as\nin fact, arguably neither did the middle Stoics) and still modify a\nrelated aspect of the early Stoic account of the soul. Psychological\nmonism implies that there is no distinction between practical and\ntheoretical reason. Knowledge bears directly on action. Indeed, all\nphilosophical knowledge is needed for good decision-making. There is\nthus, according to Stoic “orthodoxy,” no real distinction\nbetween theorizing and aiming to lead a good life (I. Hadot 1969,\n101). Seneca brings to bear this aspect of Stoic thought in his own\nway. For him, studying the arguments for a particular claim will not\nbring us peace of mind. At the outset of Letter 85, Seneca\ngoes so far as to swear that he does not take pleasure in producing\nproofs for a piece of doctrine that looms large in his\nLetters: that virtue alone brings happiness (85.1). His\naddressee, Lucilius, is presented as urging him to put forward all\narguments and objections that are relevant to this issue, and in\nresponse, Seneca discusses some of them in Letter 85. But\nultimately—and this is evident throughout his\nwritings—this is not enough. Rather, it is important to think\nthrough the implications of the Stoic thesis in a variety of practical\ncontexts, so as then to be able to live by it, for example, when one\nis or is not elected to office, has more or less money than others,\nand so on (Griffin 2007). One needs to think one’s way through\nthese issues repeatedly—and ultimately, thinking about them in\nthe right way must become a way of life. \nBut is not this conception of philosophy as a practice in tension with\nthe Stoic conception of reason? Strictly interpreted, this conception\nmight imply that whatever is once understood has become a piece of\nknowledge, and thus guides our action (see I. Hadot 1969, 106).\nSeneca, however, assumes that it is one thing to know something, and\nanother to “feel” its truth and relevance to one’s\nown life. Here is one of his examples: he knows that it does not\nmatter whether he travels in a fashionable or in a humble carriage,\nbut he blushes if people see him in a humble one (Letter\n87.4). Why should this be so? Why does Seneca suggest, in Platonic\nfashion, that one’s desires for fame and money are going to\nraise their heads if they are not constantly kept down? Second, why\nshould not the complete system of philosophical knowledge, including\nthe study of rigorous dialectical argument, be relevant to leading\none’s life well? In these respects, Seneca seems to weaken the\nearlier Stoic identification of virtue and knowledge—or perhaps,\ndepending on the view we take, he remedies some of the starkness of\nthis identification (on Seneca’s dismissive attitude toward the\nsyllogisms of “dialecticians,” and on how this differs\nfrom early Stoic thought on the value of knowledge for a good life,\nsee Cooper 2004, 314–320). \nThe Stoic understanding of the soul further involves core\nepistemological ideas. Human beings have “impressions”\n(imprints or alterations of the soul). We acquire the views we hold by\nassenting to impressions; in every given case, we can assent to an\nimpression, negate it, or withhold judgment. Since this is in our\npower, it is in our power to become wise (by assenting only to\ncognitive impressions, which represent things precisely as they are).\nHuman action is generated through “assent” to practical\nimpressions; such assent sets off impulse (hormê). If\nthere is no external impediment, impulse leads to action. It is in our\npower to become virtuous, because assent is in our control;\nwe decide how we act. Seneca discusses these and related\nissues with the help of a term that has no equivalent in Greek\nStoicism: voluntas. \nTraditionally, Seneca was seen either as the discoverer of the will,\nor, at least, a major stepping-stone towards St. Augustine (for\ndetailed discussion of the literature, see Inwood 2005 [5]; key\ncontributions are: I. Hadot 1969, Voelke 1973, Dihle 1982, Donini\n1982, Kahn 1988; for the view that already Aristotle has a conception\nof the will, see Irwin 1992; for a critique of the traditional view\nsee Rist 1969, and, recently, Inwood 2005 [5]; for the view that\nEpictetus, as opposed to Seneca, plays a major role in the development\nof the conception of a will, see Frede 2011.). \nIt is a difficult question what precisely would count as the discovery\nof the will. Clearly, voluntas and velle\n(‘willing’, ‘wanting’) figure prominently in\nmany of Seneca’s arguments. Does Seneca think there is a\nseparate faculty of the will, thus modifying psychological monism? Or\nis he interested in exploring the phenomenology of decision-making and\nself-improvement, and this leads him to describe certain mental acts\nas acts of willing (velle)? This second suggestion seems more\npersuasive, and seems to capture much of what is important to the\ntraditional interpretation: that Seneca keeps discussing how we must\nbe continually committed to self-improvement (cf. Letters\n34.3 and 71.36). Perhaps Seneca’s depictions of the mental act\nthat the Greek Stoics call assent appear in some sense richer than\nthose of the earlier Stoics (without changing the substance of the\ntheory), because Seneca likes to use metaphorical language. Rather\nthan stick with the abstract description that, in deciding what to do,\nwe assent to a practical impression, Seneca envisages us as judges,\npassing judgment over what we should be doing, and issuing commands to\nourselves (cf. Inwood 2005, [5] and [7]; Star 2012, 23–52). With\nrespect to the emotions, Seneca distinguishes between involuntary\nreactions (what earlier Stoics call “proto-emotions” or\npropatheiai) and full-blown emotions, which involve assent\nand thus are voluntary (On Anger II; see below). They are\nvoluntary in the sense that assent is in the agent’s power. This\nis a key piece of Stoic doctrine—that, whether we are foolish or\nwise, it is in our power to assent or not assent to impressions. But\nat other times, Seneca employs a normative notion of voluntariness.\nOnly virtuous action is free in the sense of being fully reasonable,\nwhile other actions spring from irrational movements of the mind such\nas emotions; in this sense, only virtuous action is voluntary\n(Letter 66.16). \nSeneca’s discussions of self-improvement raise a further\nquestion: Does Seneca discover the self (or, as Veyne puts this\nquestion, “the I”; Veyne 2003)? In a famous passage of\nOn Anger (III 36.3–4) Seneca tells his readers how he,\nevery evening, examines himself. Does Seneca’s emphasis on\nreflection involve a turn to the self, as it has seemed to many recent\nreaders inspired by Foucault’s discussions of these matters? Is\nSeneca concerned with a practice of self-shaping? In order to think\nabout the question of whether Seneca discovers or even invents the\nself, we might distinguish different versions of it. First, we may ask\nwhether Seneca modifies psychological monism, so as to make room for a\nself reflecting upon itself (in a way which makes the self have a\ncomplex structure that the Greek Stoics would not have envisaged for\nthe rational soul of human beings). Second, we might think that what\nreaders, in the wake of Foucault’s influential studies, have\nfound modern about Seneca is simply his therapeutic concern with\nfashioning one’s own life. This second view is much weaker, and\nis by now widely accepted (Long 2006, 362). The first view is\nforcefully critiqued by Inwood (2005 [12]; cf. Bartsch and Wray 2009).\nWhile Seneca invites us to engage reflectively with our lives, this\ndoes not revise basic Stoic assumptions about the soul. But we might\nalso raise a third question: Can we acceptably, to borrow a term from\nVeyne, “abuse” Seneca for our own purposes, knowing full\nwell that we are reading a certain kind of concern with the self into\nhis works which has more to do with our own times than with a precise\ninterpretation of his work? This is Veyne’s suggestion:\n“Stoicism has thus become, for our use, a philosophy of the\nactive turning in on itself of the I […]. It was\nnothing of the kind in its own day, but the Letters permit us\nto view it as such.” (2003, x). \nWhen Seneca discusses how we must hold on to the insight that only\nvirtue is good, in order to improve ourselves, it may sometimes seem\nas if he blamed the world (competition, superficial\nlifestyles, etc.) for the difficulty of the task. But ultimately,\nSeneca argues that we are standing in our own way. He tells his\naddressees that, by living in such-and-such a way, they weigh\nthemselves down (‘tibi gravis eris’; On Peace\nof Mind 3.6), or become a problem to themselves (‘tu\ntibi molestus es’; Letter 21.1). It is with a view\nto this reflective engagement with one’s thought that Hadot\nfinds ‘spiritual exercises’ in Roman Stoic philosophy (P.\nHadot 1995, 79–144; cf. Letter 6.1 on\nself-transformation). \nCare for one’s soul involves the Socratic project of aiming to\nknow oneself. In the Natural Questions, Seneca says that\nnature has given us mirrors so that we may know ourselves (ut homo\nipse se nosset). Even this external means of seeing\nourselves—which, Seneca deplores, is mostly put to less than\nvirtuous uses—serves a purpose; for example, the young see the\nbloom of their youth, thus being reminded that this is the time for\nstudy and bravery (NQ 1.16.1–17.10; cf. Williams 2005).\nUltimately, however, coming to know oneself is a matter of reflective\nself-examination and philosophical study. At the same time, Seneca\nargues that the private life and the public life are cures for each\nother (On Peace of Mind 17.3; cf. Inwood 2005 [12]). This\nbalance may indicate that the project of improving the states of\none’s mind or soul (or ‘self’) might ultimately\ninvolve what the Stoics call oikeiôsis,\n‘affiliation.’ According to Stoic theory, one should fully\nappreciate the way in which everything outside of one’s mind\n‘belongs to one’ (one’s body, other human beings,\nother parts of the world, the world as a whole). That is, in finding a\nbalance between retreat and philosophy on the one hand, and the life\nof politics on the other, one is aiming to be a citizen of one’s\nlocal community and of the world (cf. Gill 2009). \nLike St. Augustine, whose “turn inside” is as much debated\nby scholars as Seneca’s “turn to the self,” Seneca\nseems to think that turning to one’s soul is not enough—we\nneed to further turn to God. However, for Seneca, the study of nature\nand God seems to be motivated by care for one’s soul (rather\nthan, say, by love for God). In the Natural Questions, Seneca\nsuggests that the reflective engagement with our own soul is but the\nfirst step. Even if we escape the violent emotions and disruptions of\na public life, we might not yet have escaped from ourselves,\nthat is, from an excessive concern with our own particular situation\nand needs. We must turn into ourselves (in se recedendum),\nbut then we must also retreat from ourselves (a se\nrecedendum) (NQ 4.20). From a care of ourselves that\nrevolves around ethical questions, we must turn to the study of nature\nand theology (NQ 1.1–8). How does such study liberate\nus? By removing us from our localized concerns, and offering us a\ndistanced, disengaged perspective on them. The study of nature is an\nattempt at overcoming one’s mortality (NQ 1.17). More\nthan that, the ideal of virtue that is at issue in taking care of\none’s soul is, ultimately, the ideal of becoming like\nGod (Russell 2004). This is a thought that perhaps is rather\nforeign to modern psychotherapeutic techniques, and to Foucaultian\nideas about self-care. \nQuestions relating to Stoic psychological monism have been most widely\ndiscussed with a view to the theory of the emotions—here, it\nmakes a great difference whether we think that irrational desires can\novercome reason, or are irrational acts of the rational soul.\nSeneca’s treatment of the emotions has been scrutinized for\nindications of both points of view. Sorabji interprets Seneca as\nsituating his account of the emotions vis-à-vis early and\nmiddle Stoic theories that differ from his own (1989); Fillon-Lahille\nstudies On Anger with source-critical methods (1984).\nAccording to others, On Anger can be studied as a treatise on\nemotion that is basically in agreement with Stoic psychological\nmonism, and appreciated for the detailed treatment that Seneca devotes\nto this, as he sees it, particularly violent emotion (Cooper 1999;\nVogt 2006). \nAccording to the Stoics, the ideal agent has no emotions. Stoic theory\nof the emotions does not aim at moderation or “adequate”\nemotional responses. Rather, it aims at a life without emotions.\nHowever, the Stoics do not suggest that the perfect agent is\naffectively inert. Rational affective reactions and dispositions\nreplace emotion. The ideal agent has “good feelings” of\nwishing (which replaces desire), caution (which replaces fear), and\njoy (which replaces pleasure) (Cooper 2005; Graver 2007, 51–55;\nKamtekar 2005). Further, the ideal agent has proto-emotions, that is,\ninitial affective and physiological reactions that do not depend on\nassent (On Anger 2.1–4; 1.16.7). These responses which,\nfor Seneca and early Stoics, do not count as emotions, have recently\nbeen a starting point in comparing Stoic and Chinese philosophy, and\ndescribed in terms of self-emerging feelings (Machek 2015). \nThe conceptions of good or rational feelings (i.e., the affective\ndispositions and reactions of the wise person) and proto-emotions\nrender Stoic thought on the emotions less implausible than it is\nsometimes taken to be. But still, students of ancient theories of\nemotion have often felt that one simply must side with an Aristotelian\nposition—with the view that there are adequate, measured\nemotions. Suppose someone commits a crime; are we not justly angry,\nand should we not react to the crime? As Seneca puts it, will the\nideal agent not be angry if he sees his father murdered and his mother\nraped? Yes, he argues, we should react, but not with emotions and\nemotional action (revenge), no matter how curbed they might be through\nreflection. The idea of “moderate emotions,” says Seneca,\nis about as absurd as the idea of “moderate insanity”\n(Letter 85.9). Emotions are irrational (85.8); there is no\ntaming of the irrational, precisely because it is irrational. Emotions\nthus cannot be moderated—they must be replaced with\nrational responses. The ideal agent will avenge and defend others out\nof duty (quia oportet) (On Anger 1.12), not out of\nanger or lust for revenge. Scholars disagree, however, whether\nSeneca’s consolatory writings are an exception. According to Konstan\n(2015), Seneca’s consolations recommend metriopatheia,\nmoderate affection, instead of apatheia, the elimination of\ngrief. Alternatively, Fournier argues that Ad Marciam\ndisplays a progression from the aim of moderate grief to the aim of\nelimination of grief (2009). According to Machek (2015), moments where\nSeneca seems to advocate metriopatheia can be interpreted as\ninvoking the ideal agent’s proto-emotions. \nSeneca’s detailed analysis of anger adds in interesting ways to\nour knowledge of how, precisely, the Stoic claim that emotions\nare opinions plays out. According to the early Stoics, there\nare four generic emotions: pleasure (in the sense of being pleased\nabout something), pain (in the sense of being distressed or feeling\ndispleased), desire, and fear. Pleasure is directed at a presumed good\nthat is present; pain at a presumed bad that is present; desire at a\npresumed good in the future; fear at a presumed bad in the future.\nSince emotions are impulses, they result in action (if there is no\nexternal impediment). Anger counts as a kind of desire. In anger, the\nagent assents to the impression that she should take revenge. But the\njudgment that first generates anger is something like ‘He\nwronged me’. On Anger thus helps shed light on the way\nin which several judgments can figure in one emotion, and how emotion\nis tied up with irrational action (Vogt 2006; Kaster 2010,\nIntroduction). \nIn recent years, scholars have increasingly turned to a topic that is\nprominently discussed in the Aristotelian tradition, so-called\nakrasia or lack of control (for discussion of Seneca’s\nengagement with Aristotelian ideas in ethics and psychology, see\nInwood 2014, 73-104). On the Aristotelian account, the akratic agent\nacts contrary to her correct reasoning and based on desire. This view\nseems recognizable to many. It captures that desire can seem\noverpowering, “winning” in a perceived struggle between\nreason and desire. Stoic psychological monism can appear colorless and\nunrealistic in comparison. It cannot accommodate the sense that reason\nand desire are in conflict. For the Stoics, each motivational state is\na thought. What Aristotelians call akrasia is, on one early\nStoic account, an oscillation between opinions (Müller 2014). For\nexample, an agent thinks in quick succession “I’ll have\nanother cookie” and “I won’t have another cookie”;\nher hand reaches out to take the cookie at a moment when she thinks\nthe former. Recent Seneca scholars have asked whether Seneca adheres\nto the oscillation view of conflicted motivation, or whether his\naccount is closer to Aristotelian akrasia. Sorabji argues\nthat the Latin term “impotens” is Seneca’s\ntranslation of the Greek “akrates” (lacking\ncontrol); he proposes that in Seneca all cases of anger are cases of\nakrasia (2000, 61). According to Gartner (2015), on the other\nhand, On Anger is fully in agreement with Stoic monism.\nSeneca’s analysis of anger involves tumultuous states of mind,\nbut it does not involve the distinctive state of akrasia.\nWithin the framework of Aristotelian theory, akrasia is worse\nthan control (enkrateia) and much worse than virtue. Gartner\nnotes that Seneca also cannot accommodate control, because\ncontrol—just as akrasia—involves a distinction\nbetween reason and desire that is alien to Seneca’s framework.\nOther scholars pursue intermediate approaches. Rather than avoid the\nAristotelian term akrasia, Müller (2014) discusses\nSeneca’s views on motivational conflict in terms of\nakrasia; but he ascribes distinctively Stoic views to Seneca.\nOn his reading of Seneca’s tragedy Medea, Medea’s\nconflicted motivations exemplify the oscillation model. Maso (2018)\nemphasizes Seneca’s engagement with the corporeality of the\nsoul, as the Stoics conceive of it. On his reading, On Anger\ndevelops a version of psychological monism that permits dualist\nimagery and that explains motivational conflict in part in terms of\nthe physiology of inner turmoil (on the physiology of anger in On\nAnger, see also Riggsby 2015). \nNext to anger, Seneca pays most attention to fear and grief, emotions\nthat tend to dominate human life due to human mortality (NQ\n6.1.1–4.2; 32.1–12; on grief, see esp. Letters\n26, 63, 77). Fear of death is paradoxical: It wants to preserve life,\nbut it spoils life (6.32.9). It is one of the key tasks for the\nprogressor to come to terms with death (Edwards 2014; Mann 2006;\nLetters 1.2 and 4.3–9). Fear makes us “lose our\nminds,” and thus literally removes rationality (NQ\n6.29). It is through changing our views regarding the presumed badness\nof death that we can overcome fear and grief. Death is a natural\nevent, and understanding death is part of the study of nature. We fear\nmost what we do not understand; knowledge cures fear (NQ\n6.3.4). Seneca takes seriously two accounts of death: either death is\na transition to a better afterlife, or it is a genuine end. In his\ntragedies, Seneca explores more troubling scenarios (see above). The\ntragedies might illustrate irrational attitudes to death; or they\nmight be a testament to the fact that consolatory philosophy cannot\nsilence these darker visions (for a discussion of death in\nSeneca’s prose writings and poetry, and a defense of the latter\nview, see Busch 2009).  \nIn On Peace of Mind 15.1, Seneca raises an interesting\nquestion. Why does the ideal agent not deplore vice, and so feel in\nsome way bad about it? This question bears on a key aspect of the\nStoic theory. Although there are four generic emotions, there are only\nthree rational feelings; they replace pleasure, desire, and fear.\nThere is no rational correlate to pain or distress, i.e., to those\nemotions in which we judge something bad to be present. Of course, the\nwise person will not judge that illness or loss of money is bad; she\nknows that only vice is bad. But why does she not make precisely this\njudgment—that vice is bad—in such a way that an affective\nstance of ‘rational deploring’ goes along with it? Seneca\ngives an answer that is in agreement with the fundamental Stoic claim\nthat virtue benefits. The sage puts on a smile, rather than being\nsaddened, because his cheerfulness gives hope. This reply, brief as it\nis, perhaps contains the core of an argument relevant to the Stoic\nstance on (what we call) the ‘negative moral emotions’.\nPart of this argument might be that virtue does not allow for rational\nnegative affective responses, since such responses would not\nbenefit. \nIn his discussion of how the virtuous person responds to weaknesses in\nothers, Seneca extends the Stoic spectrum of rational feelings to\ninclude mercy (clementia). Seneca’s treatise On\nMercy has puzzled historians: by praising the goodness of the\nyoung Nero as Emperor—his mercy, as opposed to cruelty,\nseverity, and pity—Seneca creates the prototype of “advice\nto princes” literature (see Long 2003; cf. Kaster 2010 for a\nbrief introduction to the treatise). We cannot here enter into the\nquestion of whether Seneca chooses to ignore or did not know of the\nmurder Nero had recently committed. Perhaps the answer is simply that\nthings look different in hindsight (see Braund 2009). The Latin term\nfor mercy, clementia, is difficult to translate; sometimes\nscholars opt for clemency, thus signaling that Seneca discusses a\nvirtue that we are not immediately familiar with. In On\nMercy, clementia is a virtue of a superior. This is in\nitself a novelty within Stoic ethics. Earlier Stoics did not conceive\nof virtues for particular roles. Instead, virtue or wisdom is thought\nto translate into role-specific kinds of expertise whenever a virtuous\nperson comes to have such a role. The notion of clemency, as Seneca\ndevelops it, has its origin in Roman self-descriptions: clemency is a\nvirtue that Rome exercises vis-a-vis defeated peoples (on Seneca’s\nconception of the state in On Mercy, see Wildberger 2018c,\n169-171). That is, clemency is an attitude that was originally\ndisplayed towards enemies, not towards one’s own citizens; with\nCaesar, it becomes the virtue of an emperor (these are the outlines of\na highly instructive sketch of the concept’s history in Braund\n2009).  \nIn Seneca, clementia is a kind of restraint in a powerful\nperson who might otherwise lash out and act cruelly, and it is\nsomething like equity (cf. Braund 2009). Arguably, the first kind of\nclementia is not a Stoic virtue. A person whose savagery\nneeds to be contained cannot count as virtuous (Vogt 2011). Scholars\nalso raise the question of whether equity, understood as the ability\nof a ruler to judge a case by all its particular characteristics\n(rather than simply apply a rule) fits into Stoic philosophy (Braund\n2009). ‘Equity’ is the standard translation of the Greek\nepieikeia, which Aristotle discusses in Nicomachean\nEthics V.10. Aristotle discusses a well-known problem: the law is\ngeneral, but every case that needs to be judged is particular. Equity\nis a juridical virtue; it aims to remedy an inevitable feature of the\nlaw understood as a set of rules: its generality. According to two\ndoxographical passages, the Stoics do not ascribe equity to their wise\nperson (DL 7.123 and Stobaeus, 2.96.4–9). However, these texts\nare plausibly understood as making the claim that the Stoics do not\nascribe Aristotelian equity —and that is, the equity\nthat aims to remedy the shortcomings of general rules—to the\nwise person. The law, as the Stoics conceive of it, is not the\npositive set of laws in a given political community. For them, the\nonly law worthy of the name ‘law’ is identical with\nreason, and thus with what should be done (Vogt 2008, chapter 4).\nEquity of a distinctively Stoic kind, understood as the ability to\njudge every case by fully appreciating all particular circumstances,\nfits perfectly into the larger framework of Stoic ethics (Vogt\n2011). \nThe Stoic distinction between valuable and good things is at the\ncenter of Seneca’s Letters. So-called preferred\nindifferents—health, wealth, and so on—have value\n(their opposites, dispreferred indifferents, have disvalue).\nBut only virtue is good. Again and again, Seneca discusses\nhow health and wealth do not contribute to our happiness. Seneca\napproaches this issue not as an academic puzzle, as if we needed to be\ncompelled by intricate proof to accept this point. He speaks very\ndirectly to his readers, and his examples grip us moderns as much as\nthey gripped his contemporaries. We tend to think that life would be\nbetter if only we did not have to travel for the lowest fare, but in a\nmore comfortable fashion; we are disheartened when our provisions for\ndinner are no better than stale bread. By addressing these very\nconcrete situations, Seneca keeps hammering home the core claim of\nStoic ethics: that virtue alone is sufficient for happiness, and\nnothing else even makes a contribution. It is important to note that\npreferred indifferents have value though they are not good in the\nterminological sense of the Stoics. Scholars sometimes suggest that,\nfor Seneca, preferred indifferents are worthless and to be frowned\nupon (for example, Braund 2009). In doing so, they pick up on the\nmetaphors and examples that Seneca employs. Seneca writes with an\nacute awareness of how difficult it is not to see things like health\nand wealth as good, and that is, as contributing to one’s\nhappiness. Accordingly, Seneca keeps giving vivid examples, aiming to\nhelp his audience become less attached to things of mere value.\nHowever, he does not suggest that things like health or wealth should\nbe regarded dismissively, or not taken care of. \nA related and equally important aspect of Stoic ethics is the\ndistinction between appropriate and correct action.\nAppropriate action takes indifferents adequately into account. Both\nfools and the wise can act appropriately. But only the wise act\nperfectly appropriately, or correctly: their action\nis based on their perfect deliberation, and reflects the overall\nconsistency of their soul. Seneca explains matters in precisely this\nfashion: while we should take indifferents (health, illness, wealth,\npoverty, etc.) judiciously into account, as things of value or\ndisvalue to us, the good does not reside in getting or avoiding them.\nWhat is good is that I choose well (Letter\n92.11–12). In response to the question ‘What is\nvirtue?’, Seneca says “a true and immovable\njudgment” (Letter 71.32; tr. Inwood). Attributing any\nreal importance to indifferents, Seneca argues, is like preferring,\namong two good men, the one with the fancy haircut (Letter\n66.25). This comparison is typical for Seneca’s tendency to\ncapture the standing of valuable indifferents in forceful, figurative\nlanguage. A nice haircut, one might think, could be seen as entirely\nirrelevant. But this is not Seneca’s point. Compared to the\ngood, preferred indifferents pale, and appear as insignificant as a\nfashionable haircut when compared with genuine virtue. But preferred\nindifferents are valuable. In deliberation, we do not compare them\nwith the good; we consider them next to dispreferred indifferents. \nIn appropriate action, the agent takes things of value into account.\nThis, however, does not happen in the abstract—she does not\nweigh the value of wealth against the value of health in a general\nfashion. Rather, she thinks about the way in which a specific\nsituation and the courses of action available in it involve\nindifferents—for example, putting on the appropriate clothes for\na given occasion (Letter 92.11). Since the features of the\nsituation in which one acts thus matter to appropriate action, the\nStoics apparently wrote treatises (now lost) in which they discussed\nat length how this or that feature may bear on what one should be\ndoing (Sedley 2001). Seneca’s Letters 94 and 95 seem to\nbe examples of this kind of treatise. The very fact that such\ntreatises are written testifies to the fact that indifferents are not\nsimply irrelevant: they are the material of deliberation. \nSince Kidd (1978), Letters 94 and 95 have been read with a\nview to the question of whether rules figure in Stoic ethics (for a\ndiscussion of the letters that is not framed by this question, see I.\nHadot 1969, 8–9). This question, in turn, is relevant to our\ninterpretation of the Stoic conception of law. The Stoics have long\nbeen considered the ancestors of the natural law tradition (Striker\n1987). If the Stoics formulate rule-like precepts, then perhaps this\nmeans that the law, as the Stoics understand it, consists of a set of\nlaws. \nIn Letters 94 and 95, Seneca discusses two notions,\npraecepta and decreta, usually translated as\n‘precepts’ and ‘principles’. The topic of\nSeneca’s discussion is this. If we seek a good life by studying\nphilosophy, do we need to study only decreta, or also\npraecepta? According to the first position, the only thing\nneeded to achieve virtue is to immerse oneself in the core tenets of\nStoic philosophy. It is these that Seneca calls decreta;\ndecreta thus are not practical principles or rules. They are\nprinciples of philosophy, in the sense of being the most abstract and\nfundamental teachings of the Stoics. \nAccording to the second position, which Seneca seems to endorse,\nstudying the first principles of Stoic philosophy is not sufficient;\nwe should also think in detail about the demands that specific\nsituations in life might make on us (and so, we should study\npraecepta relating to them). It may seem that these\nlower-level considerations involve rules: in such-and-such a\nsituation, one should act in such-and-such a way (Annas 1993, 98-105;\nMitsis 2001). However, it is not clear whether Seneca indeed envisages\nsuch rules. As students of virtue, we will benefit from thinking our\nway through a variety of situations that one might encounter in life,\ncontemplating how the different features of these situations matter to\nappropriate action, and so developing a sharpened sense of the\nparticular value of the various things that do have value or disvalue\nfor a human being. Seneca’s ‘case studies’ (e.g., a\npreviously married wife should be treated differently from a\npreviously unmarried wife) perhaps only hone the students’\nappreciation for the kinds of issues that matter to appropriate\naction, where different things of value or disvalue impinge case by\ncase, rather than providing them with rules for specific situations.\nFurther, Seneca envisages an advisor who reminds us of insights such\nas ‘money does not bring happiness’. Such almost\nproverbial sayings, however, do not appear to be rules. Finally, the\nadvisor is someone who can come up with specific advice for a given\noccasion, such as ‘walk in such-and-such a way’ (see\nOn Favors 15.2; Inwood 2005 [4]; Schafer 2009, esp. regarding\nLetters 94 and 95; Vogt 2007, 189–198). As Seneca\nemphasizes in Letter 71.1, advice is adjusted to situations,\nand situations are in flux. If one needs advice, one is not asking to\nbe told the correct rule to cover the situation; one is asking how to\nbalance various considerations. \nAlthough the Stoics are, with respect to the good, most famous for the\nclaim that only virtue is good, they define the good as benefit.\nSeneca agrees with the early Stoic view that the good benefits. As we\nhave seen, Seneca thinks that both public life and philosophy are good\nforms of life, if conducted right, precisely because both are of\nbenefit to others. When discussing the benefit that a philosophical\nlife brings to others, he claims that the virtuous person’s life\nis beneficial even if she performs no public function whatsoever. Her\ngait, her silent persistence, and the expression of her eyes, benefit.\nJust as some medication works merely through its smell, virtue has its\ngood effects even from a distance (On Peace of Mind\n4.6–7). \nSeneca devotes an entire treatise to the question of how one should\nbenefit others, and how one should receive benefits, On\nBenefits (or: On Favors, lat. De beneficiis).\nOn Benefits is the longest extant Senecan treatise on one\nspecific ethical topic. Though the treatise is firmly situated in the\nRoman social context, its detailed analysis and richness of examples\nmake it more than an historical document. Seneca discusses good deeds\nand badly performed favors, graceful and ungraceful receiving, the joy\nor burden of returning favors, as well as gratitude and envy.\nSeneca’s topic is a hybrid of the kind of phenomena\nanthropologists discuss in terms of gift exchange, the specific\nconfiguration of these phenomena studied in ancient Rome, and Stoic\nviews to the effect that only the good person benefits others. This\nmix makes for a rather difficult text. It is no surprise, then, that\nthere used to be almost no helpful literature. This state, however, is\nameliorated by recent translations with philosophical introductions,\nby John Cooper and J.F. Procopé (1995; Books 1–4) and by\nMiriam Griffin and Brad Inwood (featuring also an Introduction by the\nseries editors E. Asmis, S. Bartsch and M. Nussbaum, 2011), as well as\nGriffin’s new “guide” to On Benefits\n(2013) \nWhat, then, are benefits or favors as Seneca uses the term? Roughly\nspeaking, one can think of beneficia as any kind of help a\nperson might offer to another person qua member of a group, such that\nthis strengthens the cohesion of the group and affirms or creates\nsocial bonds. Examples include: to give money or other material\nassistance, to use one’s influence in someone’s favor or\nin favor of someone’s family member, to advance someone’s\nhealth or personal safety, to save someone (her child, etc.) from\ncalamity, to get someone out of prison, to console, to speak on\nsomeone’s behalf, to further someone’s career, to teach\nand educate someone, to instruct or advise someone. \nBenefits are given largely between those who do not belong to the same\nhousehold. They thus differ from the responsibilities that attach to\nthe roles of son or wife and from the services that slaves or\nemployees are expected to perform (3.18.1). What parents do for their\nchildren, however, counts as benefit and not as role-specific\nresponsibilities. Sons are returning what they owe, thus fulfilling\nthe obligations that attach to their role. But it is important to\nSeneca that sons can also genuinely benefit their parents\n(3.29.1–38.3), for example, if through their outstanding\nachievements they put the parents into the spotlight, in\nSeneca’s eyes a priceless benefit (3.32.2). Moreover, Seneca\nspends much of Book 3 arguing that slaves can benefit their masters,\nnamely when they do more than they are compelled to do. Seneca thinks\nthat, given how hateful compulsion is for anyone, benefits conferred\nby slaves reflect an admirable ability to overcome resentment for\nbeing in the position they are in (3.19.4). \nLending (as opposed to giving) money is not a beneficium. If\nmoney or wealth is involved in a favor, it must be freely given.\nIndeed, if one does not want to stand in the kind of social\nrelationship that the giving and receiving of benefits creates, one\ncan accept money only as a loan. If, say, a person whom you did not\nwant in your life were to free you from captivity through paying the\nransom, you might accept this, but you should quickly raise the money\nto repay her. That way, no bond is established (2.21.1–2). The\ndistinction between lending and giving runs through the treatise as a\nwhole. It connects to two further ideas. First, that the right\nattitudes of giving, receiving, and returning a benefit involve\nfreedom (1.4.3; on the kind of freedom that, according to Seneca,\nmasters and slaves share, to the effect that slaves too can confer\nbenefits, see Gianella 2019). The addressee of On benefits is\ncalled Liberalis, a name that drives home a point that Seneca wants to\nemphasize. For something to count as a benefit it must not be given\nslowly, grudgingly, or in some other reluctant way; it must be given\nfreely. To be rightly received, the good deed should not be perceived\nby the recipient as a burden; it must be accepted freely. Indeed, the\nkind of emotion that reflects the appropriate attitudes on both parts\nis joy. Anything else would be suggestive of hesitations, concerns\nabout undesired ties, and so on. Second, the distinction between\nlending and giving is reflected in a distinction between justice and\nbeneficence (3.14.3–15.3). Justice appears inferior to Seneca\ninsofar as, in that sphere, we are putting faith in seals rather than\nsouls (3.15.3). If the domain of ‘good deeds’ was invaded\nby attitudes appropriate to lending and contractual obligations,\nSeneca thinks that something of great value would be lost. \nThroughout the treatise, Seneca’s focus is on attitudes, not on\nde facto performed actions. It is not the transfer of an\nobject, or the return of a favor, that ultimately counts. Strictly\nspeaking, a favor consists in the relevant state of mind of the giver\n(that he wants to benefit someone) and similarly in the grateful state\nof mind of the receiver. What we might call the intention to benefit,\nand the intention to gratefully repay the favor are the relevant\nactions of giving and receiving correctly. As some scholars put it, it\nis the act of willing which counts as a correct action (Inwood, 2005\n[3]; cf. Letter 81.10–13). These arguments reflect core\nintuitions of Stoic ethics. Scholars traditionally judge Book 4 to be\nthe part of the treatise that addresses more abstract philosophical\nquestions, thus aiming to integrate a discussion about the norms\npertaining to a historical practice in Rome with Stoic tenets in\nethics. However, this assessment is best seen as making a comparative\njudgment. There is more explicit Stoic theory in Book 4 than in the\nother books. Seneca discusses the benefits conveyed by God, drawing on\nStoic theology and philosophy of nature (see 5.3 below on Stoic\ntheology). \nOtherwise, one might argue that Book 4 is not all that different from\nthe rest of the treatise. In particular, Seneca’s question\nwhether benefits ought to be given for their own sake or for the sake\nof some advantage to the giver does not employ any quintessentially\nStoic assumptions. Indeed, one might even say that it is in\nconsiderable tension with central intuitions of earlier Stoic ethics.\nFor the Stoics, the good and the advantageous really are one and the\nsame. Moreover, Book 4 does not, as one might expect, address the\nsubtleties of the Stoic conception of the good, which would be a way\nof pushing the discussion to a more theoretical level. Seneca’s\narguments about good deeds are essentially already laid out in Books 1\nto 3. The claim that what matters are intentions and attitudes was\nalready established in ways that are relatively independent of Stoic\npremises about the good: by distinguishing benefits from obligations;\nby pointing to the dangers of burdening others with expectations they\nshall not be able to meet; by elaborating on the fact that there must\nbe a way of repaying even for those who are without material means;\nand so on. Seneca addresses in rather concrete ways the problems that\nare likely to arise in a society that is held together by the exchange\nof favors. As a result of imperfect giving, recipients easily become\ndependents and feel enslaved by their donors. \nMuch of On Benefits is normative, aiming to lay down “a\nlaw of life” (1.4.2.) about giving, receiving, and returning.\nSeneca’s recommendations, however, are based on what he\nperceives to be facts about human psychology. For example, he thinks\nthat the negative aspects of how others conduct themselves towards us\nshall stick more firmly in our minds than the positive aspects\n(1.1.8), and that we tend to have ever new desires, so that we are\ninevitably less aware of benefactions received in the past than we are\nof what we want for the present and future (3.3.1.). To give well\ninvolves recognition of such facts. Often, Seneca observes, we are\nevasive and assist only grudgingly. No wonder that our reticence\nsticks out more in people’s minds than the fact that we\neventually relented; no wonder that we are not held in esteem for such\nungracious giving (1.1.8). \nAssuming that Seneca is right, and that it is difficult to be good at\nhelping, the focus of an ethical discussion about helping should not\nbe in the first instance on how much help should be given (as it often\nis today). Rather, it should be on how one achieves something rare and\ndifficult, namely to help in such a way that the recipient does not\nend up being worse off for having been helped. Among works in modern\nmoral philosophy, the treatise that perhaps bears most resemblance\nwith On Benefits is Kant’s Doctrine of Virtue,\na book that contains so-called “casuistical” sections\nwhere Kant discusses such matters as how certain ways of helping might\nlower the recipient in her own eyes and the eyes of others, thus\nmaking the receiver appear more manifestly inferior than she should be\n(Vogt 2008). Indeed, Kant and Seneca agree on the following point\n(though of course much of the background reasoning differs): good\ngiving may even require leaving the recipient of help in the dark,\nbecause otherwise the negative effects (the social positioning of\nsomeone as recipient and ultimately dependent) can outweigh the\nbenefit (2.10.1). Seneca’s tone suggests that he agrees with a\npopular sentiment when he says that ungratefulness is an extremely\ngrave and widespread vice. And yet, he thinks that bad giving is prior\nto and often directly responsible for bad receiving or lack of\nrepaying; Book 1 and Book 2 both begin with this idea. \nIn Letter 120, Seneca explains how we arrive at the notion of\nthe good. This question is a much-discussed topic in Stoic ethics. The\nStoics hold that, in the process of growing up, human beings acquire\nrationality, which importantly consists in acquiring preconceptions\n(prolêpseis). Once a human being has reason in this\nminimal sense, she can improve and eventually perfect her rationality.\nAs part of this process she comes to acquire the concept of the good.\nThe transitional moment in which a human being finally and fully\nrecognizes that only virtue (consistency) is good is momentous: this\nis the moment in which a fool becomes a wise person (Cicero, De\nfin. 3.20–22). At that point, a human being acquires what\nwe might call the scientific concept of the good. She now masters a\nconcept of the good that gets things right—once one has this\nconcept, one is not going to fall back on misguided ideas such as\n‘money brings happiness’. But does it not seem that we\nhave a notion of the good before, eventually, turning into wise\npeople, if we do? We here must distinguish two notions. First, human\nbeings have a preconception of the good—we call things good\nbefore understanding any of the truths of Stoic philosophy. But\nsecond, we might, as progressors, also come to see the point of the\nStoic claim that only virtue is good, without yet being fully able to\nconsistently appreciate its truth in our lives. As we have seen, it is\nthis condition of the progressor that Seneca has in mind as the\nobjective he hopes to achieve in many of his writings. \nLetter 120 seems to contribute to Stoic thought about the\nacquisition of the concept of the good in precisely this fashion.\nUnlike Cicero, Seneca does not discuss the transitional moment in\nwhich an agent becomes wise. Rather, he discusses how we come to\nunderstand what the Stoics are talking about when they say that only\nvirtue is good (supposing that neither we nor those we live with\nare virtuous). When reading about great deeds, we magnify the\nvirtuous features of the agents, and minimize their negative features\n(Inwood, 2005 [10]; Hadot 2014 replies to Inwood). By these and\nsimilar cognitive operations, we arrive at an understanding of what\nvirtue would actually be. This realization enables us to see\nvirtue’s goodness without having encountered a real-life\ninstance of virtue (for the Stoics, the fully wise are rarely or never\nencountered). \nSeneca’s Natural Questions consist of eight books on\nmeteorology. Two recent publications argue forcefully for a revised\norder to the books: 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 6, 7, 1 and 2. Harry Hine’s\ntranslation is the first edition to print the books in this order\n(2010), and Gareth Williams argues that this is the most likely\nintended sequence in which the books should be read (2012). \nToday’s readers tend to show little enthusiasm when they turn to\nthe Natural Questions. What are we to think of long\ndiscussions about clouds, rain, lights in the sky, lightning and\nthunder, wind, comets, and earthquakes, combined with detailed\ntreatments of terrestrial waters and, specifically, the Nile? Why does\nSeneca devote so much time to these phenomena? Scholars read the\nNatural Questions against the background of the\nmeteorological tradition, a long-standing genre. Seneca, it is argued,\nengages in a project that is rather well established (Graver 2000, 45\nand 51). Different contributions to this genre share a common goal.\nThe rational explanation of natural phenomena will change the way we\nlive in the world. To take a simple example: a person who understands\nthe workings of thunder and lightning is not going to think that Zeus\nis sending her the message that he is angry. As Graver points out, at\nthe time when Seneca writes the Natural Questions, this kind\nof concern is most prominently associated with Epicurean philosophy\n(2000, 51). Epicurean physics is in the business of fighting\nsuperstition and fear. The person who thinks that Zeus is speaking to\nher through the weather is in turmoil; the person who understands how\nthe elements interact can live a more rational and better life. Now, a\nStoic philosopher writing on these matters faces a challenge.\nEpicureans argue that God does not concern himself with the\nparticulars of human life to the extent of signaling to us that a\ncertain action of ours did not meet his approval. The Stoic God,\nhowever, is caring, benevolent, and concerned with the details of\nhuman life. Thus, the fear that easily attaches to meteorological\nphenomena must be fought with nothing but the detail of physical\nanalysis. The argument that God would not care to send us signs is\nunavailable: the Stoic God, and Seneca agrees on this, is in principle\nsuch as to send us signs, which is why divination counts as a science\n(cf. 2.32–51 on lightning and divination; Williams 2012, chapter\n8; on Seneca’s reaction to Epicureanism, see Graver 2015). \nUltimately, the project of the Natural Questions is to\n“take measure of God” (1.17), to “walk through the\nuniverse” (mundum circuire; 3.1), to celebrate the\nworks of the gods (3.5), and to free us from fear induced by natural\nevents (6.4). The study of clouds or thunderstorms is interesting\nbecause we want to understand how clouds or thunderstorms\narise—but more than that, it must be salutary (2.59.2), and it\nhelps us achieve human excellence (3.10–18) (Inwood, 2005 [8];\non the relationship of ethics and physics, cf. I. Hadot, 1969,\n111–117). Seneca pursues a long-standing concern with making\nnature less scary, thus approaching meteorology partly from an ethical\nperspective. Moreover, the Natural Questions contain a number\nof discussions of human beings who act in what Seneca sees as\nparticularly sordid and depraved ways. These passages are often\ndescribed as digressions. Another reading, put forward by Williams\n(2012, Chapter 2), characterizes the Natural Questions as\ngoing beyond the meteorological tradition precisely because the text\nis in this particular way colorful, imaginative, and dramatic.\nWilliams argues that Seneca’s treatise is importantly an\nartistic engagement with nature. Seneca aims to make some of his\npoints by contrasting the beauty of nature’s workings with the\nugliness of vicious action. \nSeneca’s study of nature is importantly about a human\nbeing’s place and standing within the world. How could a person\nnot investigate nature, knowing that ‘all this’—the\nworld—pertains to her (ad se pertinere; Natural\nQuestions 1.13)? Seneca’s cosmopolitanism is integral to\nthe way he leads his readers into the study of nature. Only when we\nview our local lives from the perspective of the stars do we come to\nsee the insignificance of riches, borders, and so on (NQ\n1.9–13). In an influential phrase, Pierre Hadot calls this\nperspective the ‘view from above’ (1995)—a view that\nliberates us insofar as we come to see many seemingly important issues\nas mere trifles. We need the study of nature in order to reach the\nkind of distance from our everyday concerns that eventually frees us\nfrom unreasonable concern for them. And we investigate nature as\nsomething that we are a part of. In agreement with early Stoic thought\nabout the universe as a large living being with parts, Seneca thinks\nthat we are rightly motivated to study nature—nature is the\nlarge entity of which we are parts. Natural philosophy thus is\nnecessary for fully engaging with one’s life. We might note that\nSeneca contrasts the study of nature with the study of history; for\nhim, it is the seemingly more theoretical field of physics that has\ngreater practical value. It is better to praise the gods than to\npraise the conquests of Philip or Alexander (NQ 3.5).\nFurther, the study of nature is particularly valuable because it is\nthe study of what should happen (quid faciendum\nsit), as opposed to the study of what in fact did happen\n(quid factum) (NQ 3.7). \nThe Stoics are considered ancestors of the natural law tradition. The\nstandard epithet of the law, in early Stoicism, is\n‘common’ (koinos), not ‘natural’.\nSeneca, however, characterizes laws or the law as natural and talks of\nthe lex naturae (“law of nature”). Early Stoic\nthought about the law is partly rooted in the theory of appropriate\naction, and partly in a physical account of how\nreason—Zeus—pervades the world. \nIt is this physical notion of the law that is most prominent in\nSeneca. In his discussion of earthquakes and human fear, Seneca points\nout that we err by assuming that in some places, there is no danger of\nearthquakes; all places are subject to the same law (lex)\n(6.1.12). In another context, Seneca points out that the natural laws\n(iura) govern events under the earth as much as above\n(3.16.4). The world is constituted so that everything that is going to\nhappen, including the conflagration of the world when it comes to an\nend, is from the very beginning part of it. Natural events like\nearthquakes, and in fact all events, help nature go through with the\nnatural statutes (naturae constituta) (3.29.4). Since nature\n(or Zeus) decided in the beginning what was going to happen,\neverything is easy for nature (3.30.1). The study of nature aims at\naccepting facts of nature, first and foremost the fact that human\nbeings are mortal. Seneca refers to the necessity of death as a\nnatural law (NQ 6.32.12: mors naturae lex est).\nDeath is a “done deal” already at conception (On Peace\nof Mind 11.6; cf. NQ 2.59.6). It is the task of science\nto understand why death need not be feared, that the philosophical\nlife is particularly indispensable because it prepares us for death,\nand that the kinds of death that we are prone to fear particularly,\nsuch as death through an earthquake, are really not much different\nfrom more usual kinds of death. To be free according to the law of\nnature is to be prepared to die any minute (3.16). That we are all\nequals in death reflects the justice of nature (6.1.8). \nA theme that is equally present in Seneca’s natural philosophy\nand in his therapeutic practice is time. Book 3 of the\nNatural Questions is entitled On the waters of the\nearth and begins with reflections on the enormous time which the\ntask of natural philosophy may consume; on time that has been wasted\nwith worldly concerns; and the claim that it can be regained if we\nmake diligent use of the present. The fact that human life is finite\nis thus present from the very first lines of the book. Seneca then\nturns to the way in which the world’s life-cycle is as finite as\nthat of a human being. Just as a human foetus already contains the\nseed of its death, the beginnings of the world contain its end\n(3.28.2–3). It is precisely for this reason that things are easy\nfor nature. Its death does not, as it were, come as a\nsurprise—nature is well-prepared. Nature does what it initially\ndetermined; nothing in nature’s doings is ad hoc\n(3.30.1). Seneca points to examples: Look at the way the waves roll\nonto the beaches; the oceans are trained in how to flood the earth\n(3.30.2). The world’s preparedness for its death seems to be the\nperfect analogue of how, for Seneca, we ought to spend our lives. In\nLetter 12.6–8, Seneca says that everything, light\nand darkness, is contained in a single day. To use the\npresent well is to be aware of this completeness. More days, and\nmonths, and years, will (or at least may) make up our lives. But we\nshould not think of them as stretching out into the future; rather,\nthey are concentric circles surrounding the day which, right now, is\npresent. And since even this very day stretches out, from its\nbeginning to its end, we can appreciate it as containing\neverything—there can be more such days, but they will be more of\nthe same. Thus, on every such day, if it is lived well, we can be\nfully prepared to die. \nThe study of nature—of the heavens—eventually leads to\nknowledge of God (or at least, to the beginnings of such an\nunderstanding; NQ 1.13). Seneca characterizes God in a number\nof ways: (i) God is everything one sees and everything one does not\nsee. Nothing greater than his magnitude is conceivable\n(magnitudo […] qua nihil maius cogitari\npotest); he alone is everything—he keeps together his work\nfrom the inside and the outside (NQ 1.13). (ii) God is\ncompletely soul (animus) and reason (ratio) (1.14),\nor, as Seneca puts it in Letter 65.12, “reason in\naction” (ratio faciens). (iii) Like earlier Stoics,\nSeneca emphasizes that God (‘Jupiter’) can be referred to\nby many names: fate, the cause of causes (causa causarum),\nprovidence, nature, universe (NQ 2.45.2). (iv) Seneca agrees\nwith the orthodox Stoic view that God is corporeal. God is a part of\nthe world (pars mundi; NQ 7.30.4). At the same time,\nhe emphasizes that it is in thought that we have to see\nGod—he flees human eyes. The study of God is thus not the study\nof a visible entity (7.30.3–5). (v) God, or nature, is\nbeneficial (5.18.13–15). Two of these ideas are\nparticularly important to Seneca’s ethics. Much of Book 4 of\nOn Benefits is devoted to the fact that God is beneficial\n(4.3.3–4.9.1). It is through the example of God’s goodness\nthat Seneca aims to explain why giving should really not be done with\na view to one’s own advantage: there is no advantage that God\ncould possibly gain from us, and yet God benefits all of us (4.3.3).\nIndeed, God is the ultimate source of benefits; as cause of all\ncauses, God is also the cause of everything that is good for us, and\nthat includes the sun, the seasons, and so on. This connects to the\npoint that God is referred to by many names. Seneca envisages the\nobjection that these gifts do not come from God, but from nature; but\nwhoever makes this objection fails to understand that nature is but\nanother name for God (4.7.1). \nEarlier Stoic theology is partly developed in conversation with and\ncontradistinction from Epicurean theology. The central point of\ncontention in this debate is whether God concerns himself with us,\nwhether he is caring in the sense of attending to the details of how\nour lives are going. Seneca clearly shares the orthodox Stoic view\nthat God is supremely caring. For example, Seneca describes the way in\nwhich God made the world as if he had built a wonderfully stable and\nbeautiful house to present to us as a gift (4.6.2). In response to the\nquestion of how we know that there are gods, the earlier Stoics argued\nthat every human being has a preconception of God. Seneca offers a\nversion of this. The common practice of praying would be\n“insane” if there were no caring God. People would be\naddressing deities who are deaf (4.4.2). The fact that people\neverywhere seem to turn to God in prayer indicates for Seneca that\nthere must be a caring God. \nSeneca further agrees with earlier Stoic physics in taking divination\nseriously. In his discussions of thunder and lightning in the\nNatural Questions, Seneca explains that, while every natural\nevent is a sign, we should not think of God busying himself\nwith sending us, as it were, a sign at every particular occasion.\nRather, we should explain natural events by seeking out their natural\ncauses, and at the same time understand that the order of things as a\nwhole is established by God. Since there is this order, divination is\npossible (NQ 2.32.1–4). Fate is the necessity of all\nevents and actions, which no power can disrupt (2.36). Prayer cannot\nchange fate; but since the gods have left some things unresolved,\nprayer can be effective (2.37.2). \nLike other ancient philosophers, Seneca discusses virtue as the ideal\nof “becoming like God.” This is, however, not an\notherworldly ideal—rather, it is the ideal of perfecting our\nrationality, as agents living in this world (Russell 2004). We are\na part of God; to perfect our reason is to achieve the perfect\nrationality of divinity. In agreement with earlier Stoics, Seneca\nthinks that the virtuous man is an equal to the gods (Letter\n92.30–31; 87.19). Seneca’s natural philosophy and his\ntheology are thus closely related to his ethics and philosophical\npsychology. Ultimately, he is concerned with how we can perfect our\nsoul, and he pursues this question in a variety of ways—by\ndiscussing virtue, the soul, nature, and theology.","contact.mail":"kv2101@columbia.edu","contact.domain":"columbia.edu"}]
