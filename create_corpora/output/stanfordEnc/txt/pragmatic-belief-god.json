Theistic pragmatic arguments are not arguments for the \nproposition that God exists; they are arguments that believing that \nGod exists is rational. The most famous theistic pragmatic argument \nis \n Pascal’s Wager.\n Though we touch on this argument briefly below, this entry focuses \nprimarily on the theistic pragmatic arguments found in William James,\nJ.S. Mill, and James Beattie. It also explores the logic of pragmatic\narguments in general, and the pragmatic use of moral arguments in \nparticular. Finally, this entry looks at an important objection to \nthe employment of pragmatic arguments in belief formation—the \nobjection that evidence alone should regulate belief.\n\n\n\nAs with so much in philosophy, the first recorded employment of a \npragmatic argument is found in Plato. At Meno 86b-c, \nSocrates tells Meno that believing in the value of inquiry is \njustified because of the positive impact upon one’s character: \n Meno: Somehow or other I believe you are right. \nSocrates: I think I am. I shouldn’t like to take my oath on the whole\nstory, but one thing I am ready to fight for as long as I can, in \nword and act—that is, that we shall be better, braver, and more\nactive men if we believe it right to look for what we don’t know than\nif we believe there is no point in looking because what we don’t know\nwe can never discover.  \nMeno: There too I am sure you \n are.[1] \nParaphrased, Socrates’ point is if being better, braver, and more \nactive are among our desires, and if believing that inquiry is \npermissible facilitates our becoming better, braver, and more active,\nthen we have reason, pragmatic reason, to believe that inquiry is \npermissible. Socrates’ argument is an argument for the permissibility\nof a certain belief, based on the benefits of believing that certain \nbelief. Pragmatic arguments are practical in orientation, justifying \nactions that are thought to facilitate the achievement of our goals, \nor the satisfaction of our desires. If among your goals is \nA, and if doing such and such results in your achieving \nA, then, all else being equal, you have reason to do such \nand such: \n\nAs presented this is a particular kind of pragmatic argument, a \nprudential argument. Prudential pragmatic arguments are predicated \nupon one’s preferences or goals or self-interest. As we will see, \nthere are pragmatic arguments that are not narrowly prudential but \nare moral in nature. \n\nPragmatic arguments are relevant to belief-formation, since \ninculcating a belief is an action. There are, broadly speaking, two \nkinds of pragmatic arguments that have to do with belief-formation. \nThe first is an argument that recommends taking steps to believe a \nproposition because, if it should turn out to be true, the benefits \ngained from believing that proposition will be impressive. This first\nkind of pragmatic argument we can call a \n“truth-dependent” pragmatic argument, or more \nconveniently a “dependent-argument,” since the benefits \nare obtained only if the relevant state of affairs occurs. The prime \nexample of a dependent-argument is a pragmatic argument that uses a \ncalculation of expected utility and employs the Expectation Rule to \nrecommend belief: \n\nAmong the various versions of his wager argument, Pascal employs this\nRule in a version which states that no matter how small the \nprobability that God exists, as long as it is a positive, non-zero \nprobability, the expected utility of theistic belief will dominate \nthe expected utility of disbelief. Given the distinction between (A) \nhaving reason to think a certain proposition is true, and (B) having \nreason to induce belief in that proposition, taking steps to generate\nbelief in a certain proposition may be the rational thing to do, even\nif that proposition lacks sufficient evidential support. The benefits\nof believing a proposition can rationally take precedence over the \nevidential strength enjoyed by a contrary proposition; and so, given \nan infinite expected utility, Pascal’s Wager contends that forming \nthe belief that God exists is the rational thing to do, no matter how\nsmall the likelihood that God exists. \n\nThe second kind of pragmatic argument, which can be called a \n“truth-independent” pragmatic argument, or more \nconveniently, an “independent-argument,” is one which \nrecommends taking steps to believe a certain proposition simply \nbecause of the benefits gained by believing it, whether or not the \nbelieved proposition is true. This is an argument that recommends \nbelief cultivation because of the psychological, or moral, or \nreligious, or social, or even the prudential benefits gained by \nvirtue of believing it. In David Hume’s Dialogues Concerning \nNatural Religion, for example, Cleanthes employs an independent \nargument, “religion, however corrupted, is still better than no\nreligion at all. The doctrine of a future state is so strong and \nnecessary a security to morals that we never ought to abandon or \nneglect it” (Hume 1776, 87). Perhaps the best-known example of \nan independent-argument is found in William James’s celebrated \n“Will to Believe” essay in which he argues that, in \ncertain circumstances, it is rationally and morally permissible to \nbelieve a proposition because of the benefits thereby \n generated.[2] \n\nUnlike independent pragmatic arguments, dependent ones are, in an \nimportant sense, truth-sensitive. Of course, being pragmatic \narguments, dependent-arguments are not truth-sensitive in an \nevidential sense; nevertheless they are dependent on truth since the \nbenefits are had only if the recommended belief is true. In contrast,\nindependent pragmatic arguments, yielding benefits whether or not the\nrecommended beliefs are true, are insensitive to truth. \nIndependent-arguments, we might say, are belief-dependent and not \ntruth-dependent.  \n\nPragmatic arguments in support of theistic belief can either be \npredicated on prudence or on morality. By pragmatic arguments \npredicated on morality I mean arguments that contend that morality, \nor some proper part of morality, presupposes, or is facilitated by \ntheistic belief. And if morality, or the proper part of morality, is \nrational, then so too is theistic belief. Put \n generally:[3] \n\nSince (4) specifies actions, we should understand accepting theistic\npropositions as actions, even if believing is not an action (for more\non the distinction between acceptance and belief, see the section,\n“Pragmatic Arguments and Belief,” below). \n\nIt is important to recognize the distinction between theoretical \nmoral arguments for theism (arguments intended to show that God \nexists), and pragmatic moral arguments for the rationality of \ntheistic belief. George Mavrodes, for instance, constructs a \ntheoretical moral argument by contending that it would be extremely \nodd that we would have moral obligations the fulfillment of which \nresults in a net loss to the agent. Such a world seems absurd \n(Mavrodes, 1986). His argument is built upon the idea of a Russellian\nworld, a universe in which mental events are products of non-mental \nevents, and in which there’s no human post-mortem survival, and \nextinction is the final end of every biological species. A Russellian\nworld implies atheism. Summarized, Mavrodes’ argument is that \nthere are real moral obligations in the actual world. But, real moral\nobligations would be absurd in a Russellian world, since fulfilling \nmoral obligations often cause a net loss to the moral agent and there\nis no deep explanation of real moral obligation in a Russellian world\n(the deep features of a Russellian world would be things like forces \nand atoms and chance). But, fulfilling moral obligation is not \nabsurd. So, in this respect, there is reason to think that the actual\nworld is not a Russellian world. \n\nTwo examples of pragmatic moral arguments are Adams (1979) \nand Zagzebski (1987). Adams builds his argument on the concept of \ndemoralization—weakening of moral motivation—and the \nconcept of a moral order—roughly, the idea that to achieve a \nbalance of good over evil in the universe requires something more \nthan human effort, yet human effort can add or detract from the total\nvalue of the universe. While we cannot do it all on our own, the idea\nis, we can make a significant difference for better or worse. In \nshort, Adam’s argument is that it is demoralizing not to believe that\nthere is a moral order in the universe, and demoralization is morally\nundesirable. So, there is moral advantage in accepting that there is \na moral order, and theism provides the best account of why that is. \nHence, there’s moral advantage in accepting theism. \n\nZagzebski builds her argument upon the ideas of moral skepticism and \nmoral efficacy, and, though she does not employ the term, moral \norder. Morality is efficacious if we can make significant \ncontributions to the production of good in the universe and to the \nelimination of evil. Moral skepticism is a doubting of our ability to\nacquire moral knowledge, and a doubting of moral efficacy. Zagzebski \nargues that it is rational to try to be moral only if it is rational \nto believe that the probability that the attempt will succeed and \nwill produce a great good is not outweighed by the probability that \none will have to sacrifice goods in the course of the attempt. But \ngiven what we know of human abilities and history, it is not rational\nto believe that the attempt to be moral is likely to succeed if there\nis no moral order. Since it is rational to try to be moral, it is \nrational to believe that there is moral order in the universe, and \nChristian doctrine is, in part, an account of there being a moral \norder in the universe. So, accepting Christian theism is more \nrational than accepting that there’s no moral order in the universe. \n\nTheistic moral pragmatic arguments may face an objection similar to \nthe many-gods objection to Pascal’s wager. The many-gods objection \ncontends that the betting options of the wager are not limited to \nChristianity and atheism alone, since one could formulate a Pascalian\nWager for Islam, certain sects of Buddhism, or for any of the \ncompeting sects found within Christianity \n itself.[4]\n A similar problem arises for theistic moral pragmatic arguments, at \nleast insofar as those arguments are intended to provide strong \nsupport for theistic belief. Let’s say that a pragmatic argument \nprovides strong support for theism just in case it provides reason \nfor thinking that theism alone provides the benefit; and let’s say \nthat a pragmatic argument provides weak support for theism just in \ncase it provides reason for thinking that theism is just one of \nseveral alternatives in providing the benefit. Pascal’s Wager, for \ninstance, is intended to provide strong support for theism; while \nJames’s Will to Believe argument is intended to provide weak support.\nPragmatic moral arguments, if they are to provide strong support for \ntheism, must provide reason to think that theistic belief alone is \nnecessary for morality, or that theistic belief best facilitates \nmoral practice. But it’s far from clear that theistic belief exceeds \nits competitors in facilitating moral practice. Until reason for \nthinking that is forthcoming, it would be premature to hold that \ntheistic moral pragmatic arguments provide strong support.  \n\nThe argument presented by William James (1842–1910) in his 1896\nessay, “The Will to Believe”, extends far beyond the \nissue of the rationality of theistic belief to include various \nphilosophical issues (for instance, whether to embrace determinism or\nindeterminism), and even matters of practical life. James’s argument,\nin its attack on the agnostic imperative (withhold belief whenever \nthe evidence is insufficient), makes the general epistemological \npoint that: \n\nWe might understand the agnostic imperative more fully as follows:  \n\nIf James is correct, then the agnostic imperative is false. \n\nThe foil of James’s essay was W.K. Clifford (1845–79). Clifford\nargued that: \n\nClifford presented evidentialism as a rule of morality: “it is \nwrong always, everywhere, and for any one, to believe anything upon \ninsufficient evidence” (Clifford 1879, 186). If Clifford’s Rule\nof morality is correct, then any one who believes a proposition that \nshe does not take to be more likely than not, is, thereby, immoral. \nIt may be worthwhile to note that Clifford’s argument here is itself \na moral pragmatic argument. \nJames has two main concerns in the “Will To Believe”\nessay. The first is\nto argue that Clifford’s Rule is irrational (James 1896: 28). The\nsecond is that a theistic commitment is permissible. James\ncontends that Clifford’s Rule is but one intellectual strategy open to\nus. A proponent of Clifford’s Rule advises, in effect, that one should\navoid error at all costs, and thereby risk the loss of certain truths.\nBut another strategy is to seek truth by any means available, even at\nthe risk of error. James champions the latter via the main argument of\nthe “Will to Believe” essay. To facilitate matters eight\ndefinitions employed by James are paraphrased: \n\nThe first main argument might be sketched as follows:  \n\nJames asserts that “there are…cases where a fact cannot \ncome at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming” \n(James 1896, 25). Among other examples James provides of this \nparticular kind of truth is that of social cooperation:  \n\nAnd if James is right that there is a kind of proposition that has as\na truth-maker its being believed, what we might call \n“dependent truths,” then proposition (9) looks well \nsupported.  \n\nOf course, accepting proposition (11), and advancing an alternative \nstrategy of seeking truth by any available means, even at the risk of\nerror, does not entail that anything goes. And an important part of \nJames’s essay restricts what legitimately might be believed in the \nabsence of adequate evidence. Among the requirements suggested by \nJames the most important is: \n\nJames is not arguing against conforming one’s belief to the evidence,\nwhenever there’s a preponderance of evidence. Nor is he arguing \nagainst the importance of evidence. His is an argument contra the \nprohibition of believing whenever the evidence is silent, a \nprohibition implied by Clifford’s Rule.  \n\nThe requirement that an option is intellectually open may be \nredundant. If the evidence were compelling, or even strongly \nsupportive of, say, hypothesis a, and you recognized this, \nit may be that you would find only a alive. Since \nyou’re aware that the evidence strongly supports it, you would \nnot find not-a living. In other words, to say that an option\nis living may imply that it is intellectually open. Nonetheless, \nlet’s proceed as if aliveness and openness are logically distinct \nnotions. Additionally, we might ask whether the property of \nintellectual openness is to be understood as the evidence is lacking,\nor as the evidence is in principle lacking. That is, is an option \nintellectually open when the evidence is indeterminate, or when it is\nessentially indeterminate? James’s argument requires only the former.\nThe lack of adequate evidence is sufficient to render an option \nintellectually open. If more evidence appears so that one hypothesis \nis supported by a preponderance of the evidence, then a commitment to\nabide by the evidence is triggered.  \n\nThe relevance of all of this to theistic belief, according to James, \nis that: \n\nJames asserts that there are two affirmations of religion. By \naffirmation James means something like an abstract claim, devoid of \nmuch doctrinal content, and found in the major religions. The first \naffirmation is that the best things are the more eternal things, \nwhile the second is that we are better off even now if we believe the\nfirst affirmation. The first affirmation is particularly puzzling, \nsince James does not assert that the best things are the eternal \nthings; he says that the best things are the more eternal \nthings. He explicates this affirmation with three metaphors and a \nslogan: “the overlapping things, the things in the universe \nthat throw the last stone, so to speak, and say the final word. \n‘Perfection is eternal,’—this phrase of Charles \nSecrétan seems a good way of putting this first affirmation of\nreligion” (James 1896, 25). Two ideas are suggested by James’s \nexplication: sovereignty and perfection. If we understand “more\neternal” as a kind of necessity, or non-contingency, then \nperhaps the first affirmation may be understood as asserting that the\nbest things are those things that cannot fail to be sovereign and \nperfect. This interpretation resolves much of the first affirmation’s\npuzzle. The plurality though is still puzzling. We can resolve this \npuzzle by recognizing that, although he does not explicitly call it a\nthird affirmation, James asserts that “the more perfect and \nmore eternal aspect of the universe is represented in our religions \nas having personal form. The universe is no longer a mere It\nto us, but a Thou” (James 1896, 26). If we take this \nas a third affirmation of religion (perhaps at the risk a charge of \ntheistic parochialism), the possibility that the more eternal things \nare plural is foreclosed. Monotheism, in other words, and not \npolytheism is established by the third affirmation. Taken together, \nthen, the first and the third affirmations of religion suggest that \nthe supreme good in the universe is the existence of a personal being\nthat is essentially perfect and sovereign. The second affirmation is \nthat we are better off now by believing in the existence of this \nperfect being. At least in part, we would be better off now by \nbelieving the first affirmation because by doing so the possibility \nof a relationship with this being is established. \n\nAccording to James, just as one is not likely to make friends if one \nis aloof, likewise one is not likely to become acquainted with the \nperfect being, if there is such, if one seeks that acquaintance only \nafter sufficient evidence has been gathered. There are possible \ntruths, James claims, belief of which is a necessary condition of \nobtaining evidence for them. Let’s call the class of propositions \nwhose evidence is restricted to those who first believe \n“restricted propositions.” Dependent propositions and \nrestricted propositions are James’s counterexamples to Clifford’s \nRule. They are two examples of the kinds of truths that Clifford’s \nRule would keep one from acknowledging. That is, Clifford’s Rule is \nproblematic because following it would preclude access to restricted \npropositions and dependent propositions. The Cliffordian may be \nforever cut off from certain kinds of truth. \n\nOne might object that James has at best shown that theistic belief is\nmomentous only if God exists. If God does not exist, and, as a \nconsequence, the vital good of eternal life does not obtain, then no \nvital good is at stake. To answer this objection a Jamesian might \nfocus on what James calls the second affirmation of religion—we\nare better off even now if we believe—and take that affirmation\nto include benefits that are available, via pro-belief, even if God \ndoes not exist. In The Varieties of Religious Experience \nJames suggests that religious belief produces certain psychological \nbenefits:  \n\nIn any case, given that theism is intellectually open and that it’s\npart of a genuine option, and given that there are vital goods\nattached to theistic belief, James says, the hope that it is true is a\nsufficient reason to believe. In addition this objection is easily\nevaded if we revise the notion of a genuine option by removing the\nrequirement that an option is genuine only if momentous, although\nJames himself may have been loath to drop that requirement. James’s second main argument proceeds: With this argument, James seeks to support the second of his two\nprimary concerns of his essay, that a religious commitment is\npermissible. An objection commonly leveled against James’s argument is that\n“it constitutes an unrestricted license for wishful\nthinking… if our aim is to believe what is true, and not\nnecessarily what we like, James’s universal permissiveness will not\nhelp us” (Hick 1990, 60). That is, hoping that a\nproposition is true is no reason to think that it is. A\nJamesian might contend that this objection is unfair. As we have\nnoted, James does not hold that the falsity of Clifford’s Rule implies\nthat anything goes. Restricting the relevant permissibility class to\npropositions that are intellectually open and part of a genuine option\nprovides ample protection against wishful thinking.  \nA more significant objection contends that James’s argument fails \n“to show that one can have a sufficient moral reason for \nself-inducing an epistemically unsupported belief” (Gale 1990, \n283). This objection contends that there is a weighty moral duty to \nproportion one’s beliefs to the evidence, and that this duty flows \nfrom moral personhood—to be a morally responsible person \nrequires that one have good reasons for each of one’s beliefs. But to\nbelieve an epistemically unsupported proposition is to violate this \nduty and is thus, in effect, a denial of one’s own \n personhood.[5]\n Or think of it another way, as intellectual beings, we have the dual \ngoal of maximizing our stock of (significant) true beliefs and \nminimizing our stock of false ones. Clifford’s Rule derives its moral\nvalidity, one might contend, from that intellectual goal. And from \nClifford’s Rule flows our duty to believe only those propositions \nthat enjoy adequate evidential support. James’s argument would, if \noperative, thwart our intellectual goal by permitting us to violate \nClifford’s Rule. Can a morally and intellectually responsible person \never have a moral duty to believe a proposition that lacks adequate \nevidence, a duty that outweighs the alleged Cliffordian duty of \nbelieving only those propositions that enjoy adequate support? To \nanswer this, let’s employ what we might call the “ET” \nthought experiment. Suppose Clifford is abducted by very powerful and\nvery smart extraterrestrials, which offer him a single chance of \nsalvation for humankind—that he acquire and maintain belief in \na proposition that lacks adequate evidential support, otherwise the \ndestruction of humankind will result. Clifford adroitly points out \nthat no one can just will belief. The ETs, devilish in their \nanticipation as well as their technology, provide Clifford with a \nsupply of doxastic-producing pills, which when ingested produce the \nrequisite belief for 24 hours. It’s obvious that Clifford would do no\nwrong by swallowing the pills and bringing about a belief lacking \nadequate evidential \n support.[6]\n Moreover, since one is never irrational in doing one’s moral duty, \nnot only would Clifford not be immoral, he would not even be \nirrational in bringing about and maintaining belief in a proposition \nlacking adequate evidential support. As we mentioned earlier, given \nthe distinction between (A) having reason to think a certain \nproposition is true, and (B) having reason to induce a belief in that\nproposition, it may be that a particular proposition lacks sufficient\nevidential support, but that forming a belief in that proposition is \nthe rational action to perform.  \n\nA very interesting objection to James’s argument is that it falls \nprey to the very principle it invokes against Clifford: \n\nAccording to James, Clifford’s Rule is problematic because, if \nfollowed, it would preclude access to restricted propositions and \ndependent propositions. According to this objection, this alleged \nflaw of Clifford’s Rule is true of any epistemic principle. Every \nepistemic principle that divides beliefs into those that are \npermissible and those that are not runs the risk of shutting off \naccess to certain possible kinds of truth. James’s restriction of the\npermissible use of the passional nature only to when one faces a \ngenuine option that’s intellectually open is just as guilty of the \nalleged flaw as is Clifford’s Rule. But an alleged flaw found in \nevery possibility is no flaw. Hence, James’s objection to Clifford \nfails. \n\nThis objection is interesting since it is in one sense true. It’s \nobvious that any rule that restricts belief in any way might shut us \noff from certain truths. Still, while interesting, this objection is \nirrelevant. James’s argument is not predicated on the abstract \nproposition that “any rule whatever that restricts belief in \nany way might conceivably shut us off from some truths.” It is \npredicated on the principle that there are dependent propositions, \nand there are restricted propositions. His examples of social trust, \nand acquiring friends, and of social cooperation are intended to make\nthat clear. If theism were true, then it is very likely that there \nwould be dependent propositions and restricted propositions in that \nrealm as well. Clifford’s Rule would preclude access to any \nrestricted or dependent proposition, whether religious or not. James \nis not arguing against conforming one’s belief to the evidence, \nwhenever there’s a preponderance of evidence. He is arguing against \nthe prohibition of believing whenever the evidence is silent. Since \nJames’s argument specifies the irrationality of Clifford’s Rule’s \nexclusion of dependent and restricted propositions, and not just the \nabstract possibility of some kind of true belief or other being \nexcluded, it escapes this objection. \n\nWilliam Wainwright has argued that James’s argument properly fits \nwithin an old Christian tradition, which asserts that: \n\nIf Wainwright is correct, then James’s argument is not just a\npragmatic argument, but also an epistemic argument, since he is\narguing that one of the pragmatic benefits is a more reliable access\nto reality (see also the explication of James’ argument via\ncontemporary epistemic utility theory in Pettigrew 2016). So, the\nchasm between the epistemic and the pragmatic is not unbridgeable,\nsince James’s Will to Believe argument spans the gulf between the\npragmatic and the epistemic. Importantly, we should keep in mind that\nwhatever else it is, James’s argument is, at least in part, a\npragmatic argument, and, moreover, James probably saw his argument as\nhaving a similar status as Pascal’s Wager, since he offers a positive\nevaluation of the Wager, very often overlooked by commentators,\n“Pascal’s argument, instead of being powerless, then seems a\nregular clincher, and is the last stroke needed to make our\nfaith…complete” (James 1896, 11). \n\nThe posthumous publication of Mill’s Three Essays on \nReligion (1874) drew criticism from the faithful, but it also \ndrew a surprising disappointment from those who expected the \n“saint of rationalism” to argue for agnosticism. The \ncause of this consternation is found in the third of the three \nessays, “Theism,” a short work begun in 1868 and \nunfinished when Mill died in 1870. The faithful found \n“Theism” objectionable because of Mill’s criticism of \nseveral of the standard arguments of natural theology. The \ndisappointment of the other side flowed from Mill’s endorsement of a \nposition that can be summed up by the principle that where \nprobabilities fail, hope can properly flourish. As Mill expressed \nthis principle when discussing immortality, “…to any one\nwho feels it conducive either to his satisfaction or to his \nusefulness to hope for a future state as a possibility, there is no \nhindrance to his indulging that hope” (Mill 1874, 210). Mill \nthought that belief in a creator of great but limited power was \nsupported by the design argument, and one could certainly erect the \nsuperstructure of hope upon the base of a belief in a creator who \nwould extend human existence beyond the grave: \n\nSince we do not know that granting postmortem existence to humans is \nbeyond the capability of the creator, hope is possible. As Mill puts \nit: \n\nFor our purposes the item of interest is Mill’s claim that “any\none who feels it conducive either to his satisfaction or to his \nusefulness to hope for a future state as a possibility, there is no \nhindrance to his indulging that hope” (Mill 1874, 210). Mill’s \nlicense to hope is issued on pragmatic grounds: it is permissible to \nhope if and only if: \nL2. One believes that hoping contributes to one’s own happiness, or \nto the well-being of others. \n\nThe second condition (L2) is straightforwardly pragmatic and \nrestricts hope to those who have goals either of personal happiness, \nor of contributing to the well-being of others. Believing that hope \nwill result in the increase of happiness or well-being is a necessary\ncondition of permissible hope.  \n\nThere’s little doubt that Mill agreed with Clifford’s Rule. Mill was \nno subjectivist or fideist. But hope and belief are not the same; and\nthe standards for the permissibility of the latter are considerably \nhigher. Mill thought that (L1) and (L2) were the relevant standards \nfor permissible hope. If one believes that Clifford’s Rule should \ngovern any and all propositional attitudes and not just belief, then \nit is easy to see why Mill’s liberal treatment of hope would \ndisappoint. Mill held that one may hope that God exists, but one may not\nbelieve that God exists, as the evidence is lacking.  Suppose one\nagrees with Mill, that faith can subsist on hope, trust, or some other\nnon-doxastic attitude other than belief.  Suppose further that\none seeks to build a theistic commitment on hope.  The acceptance\nof theistic hope provides reason to act as if theism were true, not\nbecause one believes that it is true, but because one hopes that\nit is.   What is it to act as if theism is true?  It is to\nput into practice behaviors characteristic of a particular religious\ntradition, such as Judaism, Christianity, or Islam.  Acting as if\na certain religious tradition were true would include reorienting\none’s values, priorities, and life-projects in order to reflect a\ncommitment to a particular tradition.  It would also involve\nengaging in the rituals and behaviors associated with the particular\ntradition; and investing a significant portion of one’s time and money\nin support of causes associated with the tradition. A problem\narises however.   Social psychology, with its theories of biased\nscanning, social-perception theory, and cognitive dissonance theory,\nadvances the idea that behavior can alter, influence, and generate\nattitudes, including beliefs (see Jordan 2016).  By regularly engaging in behaviors\nand practices characteristic of a particular religious tradition, one\nengages in actions that tend to inculcate religious belief.\n Belief is catching, as associating and imitating the faithful is\nan effective way of self-inducing the beliefs of the faithful.\n Those who seek to replace belief with hope will find themselves\ntaking steps to build a theistic commitment on hope, while holding\nthat they ought to avoid theistic belief. Yet, the very steps involved\nin fostering a commitment on hope – immersive role-playing as a\ntheist, or acting as if theism were true – tend to generate theistic\nbelief.   Those who habitually or chronically imitate the actions\nand rituals of theists find eventually that those are not just tasks\nthey perform, but are at the heart of who they are and what they\nbelieve.   Yet, theistic belief is off-limits.  One\nwould have to take steps that inoculate against the contagious\ntheistic belief.   Yet, the reasons one has to build a theistic\ncommitment on hope and not belief, would conflict with one’s reasons\nto inoculate against catching belief. One is pushed to act as if\ntheism were true, yet pulled to act to ensure that one does not come\nto believe that it is.  Whatever commitment might emerge out of this\ndynamic is not likely one characteristic of a mature or wholeheartedly\ncommitted theist.  This problem of catching belief flows out of the fact that\nchronically acting as if something is true is an effective way of\ninculcating the belief that it is true.  Any non-doxastic account of\nfaith put into regular practice, coupled with Clifford’s Rule,\nis exposed to the problem of catching belief.  Religious Fictionalism,\nfor example, which holds that faith that p does not require\nbelief that p, has to deal with the problem. For more\ndiscussion, see Malcolm and Scott 2017, and Jordan 2016.  \n\nIn 1770 James Beattie (1735–1803) published a long response to \nHume entitled An Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth, \nin Opposition to Sophistry and Scepticism. The essay was a 300 \npage best seller, which, most commentators agree, was unfair in many \nrespects to Hume. As was his practice, Hume never made an effort to \nanswer Beattie in public; in correspondence, however, Hume referred \nto Beattie as that “bigoted silly \n fellow.”[7] \n\nDespite the general weakness of many of his arguments Beattie does \noffer an interesting pragmatic moral objection to Hume’s attack on \nreligious belief: \n\nBeattie argues that Hume’s clear cutting of the theistic forest in \nhis attack on the credibility of miracle reports, his criticism of \nthe design argument, and his attack on the cosmological argument \nresulted in a desolated landscape that does a serious disservice to \nhumankind. Since in some cases, Beattie contends, despair flows from \nthe loss of faith. And he assumes that no justifying good exists for \nHume to risk causing despair.  \n\nLet’s understand desolation as a profound sense of hopelessness and \npurposelessness. Beattie believed that Christian belief provided \nconsolation, especially to those suffering or oppressed. His argument\nmight be reconstructed as there exists a person S, such \nthat: \n\nWhile Hume never directly responded to Beattie’s Consolation \nArgument, Mill had it (or something very much like it in mind) when \nhe wrote: \n\nThis is an odd objection coming from one who argued in \nUtilitarianism “actions are right in proportion as \nthey tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the \nreverse of happiness.” If the sole criterion of action is the \nproduction of happiness, and if forming a belief is an action, then \nit is hard to see what answer could be lodged against Beattie’s \nConsolation Argument (or at least some argument very much like \n it).[8]\n If happiness and consolation are irrelevant, and if Clifford’s Rule \nthat “it is wrong always, everywhere, and for any one, to \nbelieve anything upon insufficient evidence” is correct, then \nBeattie’s consolation argument can be rejected as being itself an \nimmoral \n subornation.[9] \nAn argument similar to Beattie’s consolation argument is found\nin a suggestive passage of John Henry Newman’s 1870 An Essay\nin Aid of A Grammar of Assent, famously known as the\n“factory girl” argument.  Newman (1801–1890) did not\nformulate the “factory girl” argument as a pragmatic argument, but the\nargument certainly lends itself to such a formulation: \nMontaigne was endowed with a good estate, health, leisure and an easy\ntemper, literary tastes, and a sufficiency of books; he could afford\nthus to play with life, and the abysses into which it leads us. Let us\ntake a case in contrast. \n Here is an argument for the immortality of the soul (Newman 1870, 299–300). \n  \nThis argument lends itself easily to a pragmatic cast since it places\ngreat weight on the idea that certain human needs support the rational\nand moral legitimacy of religious belief: \nThis sort of argument faces many questions and issues that we cannot\nexplore here. Among these issues and questions are: suppose that one,\nmorally and rationally, may satisfy a need, it does not follow that\none can satisfy that need in any old way. Some ways of satisfying a\nneed are permissible while others are not. Is belief in God a\npermissible way? Do humans in fact have the alleged needs? Is belief\nin God the only feasible way to satisfy those needs? See Williams 2011\nfor further discussion. \n\nClifford’s Rule is a vivid presentation of an influential and long \ntradition in philosophy that carries the name of Evidentialism. We \ncan understand Evidentialism as the thesis that: \n\nClearly enough, pragmatic arguments run afoul of (E), since pragmatic\narguments are employed either when the evidence is inconclusive, or \nit is conclusively adverse. Consider the latter case first. Earlier \nit was mentioned that Pascal’s Wager is the most famous example of a \ntheistic pragmatic argument. Pascal in fact has not one version of \nthe Wager in his Pensées (1660) but four. The third \nversion of the Wager is what Ian Hacking (1972) entitles the \n“Argument from Dominating Expectation,” and it employs \nthe Expectation rule. We can represent it by letting p stand\nfor a positive probability greater than zero and less than one-half, \nand letting EU stand for “expected utility,” and \nemploying F2–F4 as finite values: \n\nNo matter how unlikely it is that God exists, as long as there is \nsome positive non-zero probability that he does, believing is one’s \nbest bet: \n\nBecause of its ingenious employment of infinite utility, the third\nversion has become what most philosophers think of as Pascal’s\nWager.  The appeal of the third version for theistic apologists is its\nready employment as a worst-case device. Suppose there were a\ncompelling argument for atheism. With the third version the theist has\nan escape: it can still be rational to believe, even if the belief is\nitself unreasonable, since inculcating theistic belief is an action\nwith an infinite expected utility. This use as a worst-case device is\nsomething like a trump card that can be thrown down defeating what had\nappeared as a stronger hand. Pascal’s third version clearly\nviolates (E).  \n\nNow consider James’s Will to Believe argument. As we saw, James’s \ncontention is that any hypothesis that’s part of a genuine option, \nand that’s intellectually open, may be believed, even in the absence \nof sufficient evidence. No rule of morality or rationality, James \nargues, is violated if one accepts a hypothesis that’s genuine and \nopen. If James is correct, then (E) should be replaced with: \n\nAccording to (E′) if the evidence is adequate, then the \nquestion is settled. If there’s a preponderance of support for \np, then one is required to believe p. Where the \nevidence speaks, one must listen and obey. (E′) differs from \n(E) in part since it says nothing about those occasions in which the \nevidence is silent, or is inadequate. If one assigns p a \nprobability of one-half, then there’s not a preponderance of evidence\nin support of p. (E′) says nothing about believing \np in that case. Principle (E), on the other hand, forbids \nbelieving p in that case. While a proponent of theistic \npragmatic arguments cannot swear allegiance to (E), she can, clearly \nenough, adhere to (E′). Let’s call (E) Strong Evidentialism, \nand (E′) Weak Evidentialism. So, an employer of theistic \npragmatic arguments can conform to Weak Evidentialism, but not Strong\nEvidentialism. \nIs there a good reason to prefer Weak Evidentialism to Strong (in\naddition to James’s argument)? A promising argument in support of the\nmoral and rational permissibility of employing pragmatic reasons in\nbelief-formation is erected upon the base of what we might call the\nDuty Argument (or perhaps more precisely, the Duty Argument\nscheme): \n\nThe Duty Argument employs the box and diamond in the standard fashion\nas operators for, respectively, conceptual necessity and\npossibility. The alpha is just a placeholder for actions, or kinds of\nactions. The locution “(overall) rational” or\n“(overall) irrational” presupposes that there are various\nkinds of rationality, including moral rationality, epistemic\nrationality, and prudential \n rationality.[10] \n The idea that there are various kinds of rationality, or put any way,\nthat one can be under conflicting obligations at a particular time,\nrecognizes that dilemmas are possible. One can be obligated to do\nvarious things even when it’s not possible to do all of them. Overall\nrationality is the all-things-considered perspective. It is what one\nultimately should do, having taken into account the various\nobligations one is under at a particular time. Overall rationality, or\nall-things-considered rationality (ATC rationality), is, in W.D.\nRoss’s terms, one’s actual duty in the particular circumstances, even\nif one has other conflicting prima facie duties. The Duty\nArgument can be formulated without presupposing that there are various\nkinds of rationality, by replacing the principle that no one is\never irrational in doing her moral duty, with the principle\nthat moral obligations take\nprecedence whenever a dilemma of obligations occurs. In any\ncase the Duty Argument assumes that if in doing something one is not\nATC irrational, then it follows that one is ATC rational in doing\nit.  \nThe relevance of the Duty Argument is this. The action of\nforming and sustaining a belief upon pragmatic grounds can replace\nα. That is, pragmatic belief formation could be one’s moral\nduty.  Consider the following four cases in which pragmatic\nbelief formation is, arguably, morally required: Devious ETs: Suppose you are abducted by very powerful and\nadvanced extraterrestrials, who demonstrate their intent and power to\ndestroy the Earth.  Moreover, these fiendish ETs offer but one\nchance of salvation for humankind – you acquire and maintain a\nbelief for which you lack adequate evidence.  You adroitly point\nout that you cannot just will such a belief, especially since you know\nof no good reason to think it true.  Devilish in their\nanticipation and in their technology, the ETs produce a device that\ncan directly produce the requisite belief in willing subjects, a\nserum, say, or a supply of one-a-day doxastic-producing pills. \nIt is clear that you would do no wrong by swallowing a pill or\ninjecting the serum, and, hence, bringing about and maintaining belief\nin a proposition for which you lack adequate evidence, done to save\nhumankind.  Indeed, it is clear that you are in fact obligated to\nbring about the requisite belief, even though you lack adequate\nevidence for it. Pain case: Jones knows that expecting an event to\nbe painful is strongly correlated with an increase in the intensity of\nfelt pain (as opposed to having no expectation, or expecting the event\nto be relatively painless).  Jones is about to have a boil\nlanced, and believing that she is obligated to minimize pain, she\nforms the belief that the procedure will be painless.  She does\nso even though she lacks evidence that such procedures are in fact\ntypically painless.  Because of her action, the event is in fact\nless painful than it would otherwise have been. Small child:  Suppose you are the parent or\ncustodian of a small child, who has been hurt.  You know that\nstudies support the thesis that the felt pain reported by patients is\ntypically higher in cases in which the patient expected the event to\nbe painful than in cases where the patient did not have that\nexpectation.  You have no idea about the relative pain associated\nwith a particular medical procedure that the child is about\nundergo. The child asks you if the procedure will be painful. \nDesiring to lower the pain the child will feel, you tell the child\nthat the procedure will not hurt, hoping that the child will form a\nbelief not supported by the evidence, but thereby lowering the\nchild’s felt pain. Doctor case: Dr. Jones knows that the prognosis for\nSmith’s recovery is poor, but if she acts on that knowledge by\ntelling Smith of his poor prognosis, she may well strip Smith of\nhope.  Jones believes that maintaining hope is vital for quality\nof life.  Overall, Jones decides it is better not to inform Smith\njust how poor the prognosis is and she does not disabuse Smith of her\nevidentially unsupported belief. \nThese four cases provide possible scenarios in which pragmatic\nbelief formation, or suborning pragmatic belief formation in others,\nis morally required. \nAlthough controversial, the Duty Argument, if sound, would provide\ngood reason for thinking that there are occasions in which it is\npermissible, both rationally and morally, to form beliefs based upon\npragmatic reasons even in the absence of adequate evidence.  If\nthe Duty Argument is sound, then (E) is false. \nThe Duty Argument presupposes that there are various kinds of\nrationality. Many Evidentialists, as well as many opponents of\nEvidentialism, also assume that there are various kinds of\nrationality.  What if however there is only one kind or standard\nof rationality? What impact would that have on the debate? Susanna\nRinard argues that it is best to reject the idea that there are\nvarious kinds or standards of rationality, and replace that idea with\nan equal treatment idea that all states – whether doxastic or\nnot – face a single standard of rationality (Rinard 2017). \nEqual treatment of states – states like carrying an umbrella, or\nwalking the dog, or voting for this candidate over that, or forming a\nbelief in God – provides greater theoretical simplicity than\ndoes the idea that there are various standards or kinds of\nrationality.  Equal Treatment also better explains the\nmethodological attraction of simplicity in science than does the idea\nthat there are various kinds of rationality, Rinard argues. If the\nequal treatment of all states idea is correct, then doxastic states\nwould face the same standard of rationality as states of action. \nThe Equal Treatment idea provides an additional objection to\nEvidentialism insofar as Evidentialism implies that beliefs are\nsubject to one standard, while other states are subject to another\nstandard. Whether it is via Rinard’s Equal Treatment argument, or the\nDuty Argument, there is, arguably, good reason to reject\nEvidentialism. \n\nThe idea that persons can voluntarily and directly choose what to\nbelieve is called “Doxastic Voluntarism”. According\nto Doxastic Voluntarism, believing is a direct act of the will, with\nmany of the propositions we believe under our immediate control. \nA basic action is an action that a person intentionally does, without\ndoing any other action. Jones’ moving of her finger is a\nbasic action, since she need not perform any other action to accomplish\nit. Her handing the book from Smith to Brown is not basic, since\nshe must intentionally do several things to accomplish it. \nAccording to Doxastic Voluntarism, some of our belief acquisitions are\nbasic actions. We can will, directly and voluntarily, what to\nbelieve and the beliefs thereby acquired are freely obtained and are\nnot forced upon us. In short, one can believe at will. The\nproponent of Doxastic Voluntarism need not hold that every proposition\nis a candidate for direct acquisition, as long as she holds that there\nare some propositions belief in which is under our direct\ncontrol.  \n\nIt is widely thought that Doxastic Voluntarism is\nimplausible. Opponents of Doxastic Voluntarism can present a simple\nexperiment against it: survey various propositions that you do not\ncurrently believe, and see if any lend themselves, directly and\nimmediately, by a basic act of the will, to belief. Certainly there\nare some beliefs that one can easily cause oneself to have. Consider\nthe proposition that I am now holding a pencil. I can cause myself to\nbelieve that by simply picking up a pencil. Or more generally, any\nproposition about my own basic actions I can easily enough believe by\nperforming the action. But my coming to believe is by means of some\nother basic action. Since I lack direct control over what I believe,\nand there’s no reason to think that my lacking in this regard is\nsingular, Doxastic Voluntarism is implausible. Does the implausibility\nof Doxastic Voluntarism show that pragmatic belief-formation is also\nimplausible?  \nNot at all: think of Pascal’s advice to act as if one already believes\n(by going to masses and by imitating the faithful) as a way of\ninculcating belief.  Pragmatic belief-formation neither entails nor\npresupposes Doxastic Voluntarism. As long as there is indirect\ncontrol, or roundabout control, over the acquisition and maintenance\nof beliefs, pragmatic belief-formation is possible. What constitutes\nindirect control over the acquisition of beliefs? Consider actions\nsuch as entertaining a proposition, or ignoring a proposition, or\ncritically inquiring into the plausibility of this idea or that, or\naccepting a proposition. Each of these involves a propositional\nattitude, the adoption of which is under our direct control.  Indirect\ncontrol occurs since accepting a proposition, say, or acting as if a\nproposition were true, very often results in believing that\nproposition. Insofar as there is a causal connection between the\npropositional attitudes we adopt, and the beliefs that are thereby\ngenerated, we can be said to have exercised indirect, or roundabout,\ncontrol over belief-formation.  \nOne objection to the foregoing is that pragmatic arguments are, by and\nlarge, pointless because beliefs are, by their very nature,\npsychological states that aim for truth. That is, whenever one\nbelieves a proposition, one is disposed to feel that that proposition\nis probably the case. A person ordinarily cannot believe a proposition\nthat she takes to have a probability of less than one-half or whose\nprobability is uncertain since such propositional attitudes do not aim\nfor truth. The upshot of this objection is that strong evidentialism\nis unavoidable. \nIf it is true, as this objection holds, that believing a proposition\nordinarily involves being disposed to feel that the proposition is the\ncase then it does appear at first blush that pragmatic\nbelief-formation, as such, is ineffectual. But all that follows from\nthis fact, if such it be, is that some sort of belief-inducing\ntechnology will be necessary in order to facilitate the acquisition of\na proposition that is pragmatically supported. Now it is true that the\nmost readily available belief-inducing technologies\n– selectively using the evidence for instance – all involve a degree\nof self-deception, since one ordinarily cannot attend only to the\nfavorable evidence in support of a particular proposition while\nneglecting the adverse evidence arrayed against it and, being conscious\nof all this, expect that one will acquire that belief. The fact\nthat self-deception is a vital feature of the readily available\nbelief-formation technologies leads to another objection. \nThis second objection is that willfully engaging in self-deception\nrenders pragmatic belief-formation morally problematic and rationally\nsuspect, since willfully engaging in self-deception is the deliberate\nworsening of one’s epistemic situation. It is morally and rationally\nproblematic to engage in pragmatic belief-formation, insofar as\nbelief-formation involves self-deception. \nThis second objection is powerful if sound, but we must be careful\nhere. First, while self-deception may be a serious problem with regard\nto inculcating a belief which one takes to be false, it does not seem\nto be a serious threat involving the inculcation of a belief which one\nthinks has as much evidence in its favor as against it, nor does it\nseem to be a threat when one takes the probability of the proposition\nto be indeterminate, since one could form the belief knowing full well\nthe evidential situation. Even if it is true that believing that p\nis being disposed to feel that p is the case, it does not\nfollow that believing that p involves\nbeing disposed to feel that p is the case based on the evidence at\nhand. Second, this is an objection not to pragmatic\nbelief-formation per se, but an objection to pragmatic\nbelief-formation that involves self-deception. Although it may be\ntrue that the employment of self-deceptive belief-inducing technologies\nis morally and rationally problematic, this objection says nothing\nabout those belief-inducing technologies that do not involve\nself-deception. If there are belief-inducing technologies which\nare free of self-deception and which could generate a belief on the\nbasis of a pragmatic reason, then this objection\nfails.[11] \nIs there a belief-inducing technology available that does not involve\nself-deception? There is.  Notice first there are two sorts of\nbelief-inducing technologies distinguishable: “low-tech”\ntechnologies and “high-tech” ones. Low-tech technologies\nconsist of propositional attitudes only, while high-tech ones employ\nnonpropositional techniques along with various propositional\nattitudes. The nonpropositional techniques could include actions like\nacting as if a certain proposition were true, and morally questionable\nones like hypnosis, or indoctrination, or subliminal\nsuggestion. Consider a technology consisting of two components, the\nfirst of which is the acceptance of a proposition, while the second is\na behavioral regimen of acting on that acceptance. Accepting a\nproposition, unlike believing, is an action that is characterized, in\npart, by one’s assenting to the proposition, whether one believes it\nor not. One accepts a proposition, when she assents to its truth and\nemploys it as a premise in her deliberations. One can accept a\nproposition that one does not believe. Indeed, we do this much of the\ntime. For example, think of the gambler’s fallacy. One might be\ndisposed to believe that the next toss of the fair coin must come up\nTails, since it has been Heads on the previous seven\ntosses. Nevertheless, one ought not to accept that the next toss of a\nfair coin must come up Tails, or that the probability that it will is\ngreater than one-half. Acceptance, we should remember, unlike\nbelieving, is an action that is under our direct control.  \nIf one accepts a proposition, then one can also act upon the\nproposition. Acting upon a proposition is behaving as though it were\ntrue. The two-step regimen of accepting a proposition and then acting\nupon it is a common way of generating belief in that proposition. And,\nimportantly, there is no hint of self-deception tainting the\nprocess. \nOne might object that employing a belief-inducing technology at all,\nwhether low or high tech, is enough to entangle one in issues\nimplicating the rationality of the belief induced (see, for instance,\nGarber, 2009). A friend of the pragmatic, however, might argue that\nthat this objection presupposes Strong Evidentialism, and arguments\nfound in William James, the Duty argument, the Equal Treatment\nargument, have already provided a dispositive ruling on that issue. \n\nWhile not as common as theistic arguments, there have been atheistic \npragmatic arguments offered from time to time. These arguments often \narise within the context of a purported naturalistic explanation of \nthe occurrence of religious belief and practice. Perhaps the earliest\nproponent of an atheistic pragmatic argument was David Hume \n(1711–1776). In chapter X of his 1757 The Natural History \nof Religion, Hume wrote: \n\nThe idea of Hume’s argument here and elsewhere in his writings (see \nfor instance Dialogue XII of his Dialogues Concerning Natural \nReligion, and appendix IV of the second Enquiry) is that theism,\nor at least theism of the popular sort—that conjoined with \n“superstitious terrors,” degrades individual morality, \nthereby devaluing human existence. Theistic belief, Hume contended, \ninculcates the “monkish virtues of mortification, penance, \nhumility, and passive suffering, as the only qualities which are \nacceptable…” But not only does theistic belief harm \nindividual morality, according to Hume, it also harms public \nmorality. In chapter IX, Hume suggested that theism (again he \nqualifies by writing of the “corruptions of theism”) \nleads to intolerance and persecution. \n\nAnother atheistic pragmatic argument is that of Sigmund Freud \n(1856–1939), who in The Future of an Illusion (1927) \ncontends that religious belief perpetuates psychological immaturity \namong individuals, and cultural immaturity on the social level. To \nmake sense of Freud’s argument requires knowing that he employed the \nterm “illusion” in an idiosyncratic way. An illusion in \nthe Freudian sense is a belief that is caused by and in turn \nsatisfies a deep psychological need or longing. Illusions are not \nheld rationally. Illusions stick even in the absence of any \nsupporting evidence. Indeed, according to Freud, they stick even in \nthe face of strong contra-evidence. An illusion could be true, but \noften they are not. Delusions are false illusions. Religious belief \nFreud thought was an illusion. While it may have been a beneficial \nillusion at an earlier time, it no longer is. The religious illusion \nnow, Freud asserted, inhibits scientific progress, and causes \npsychological neuroses, among its other pernicious effects. \n\nAnother atheistic pragmatic argument is Richard Dawkin’s\ncontention that religious belief is a “virus of the mind”\n(Dawkins 1993). One is religious, according to Dawkins, because one\nhas been infected by a faith meme. A meme is Dawkins’s\nimaginative construct, which he describes as a bit of information,\nmanifested in behavior, and which can be copied from one person to\nanother. Like genes, memes are self-replicating vehicles, jumping from\nmind to mind. One catches a meme by exposure to another who is\ninfected. Dawkins claims that the faith meme has the following\ntraits: \nM1. The faith meme seems to the person as true, or right, or \nvirtuous, though this conviction in fact owes nothing to evidence or \nreason. \nM2. The faith meme makes a virtue out of believing in spite of there \nbeing no evidence. \nM3. The faith meme encourages intolerant behavior towards those who \npossess rival faiths. \nM4. The faith meme arises not because of evidence but because of \nepidemiology; typically, if one has a faith, it is the same as one’s \nparents and as one’s grandparents. \nDawkins’s meme idea, and his dismissal of faith as a virus of the \nmind, is both a purported naturalistic explanation of religious \nbelief and a pragmatic dismissal of it as a harmful phenomenon. \nA contemporary atheistic pragmatic argument is that the existence of\nGod would make the world far worse in some respects than would be the\ncase if God did not exist, even if it did not make the world worse\noverall (Kahane 2011).  As Kahane notes, if God were to exist, then a\nfull understanding of reality by humans, may in-principle be\nunachievable.  Additionally, if God were to exist, moral autonomy may\nbe limited, since humans, as creatures, might be subordinate to God’s\ndemands, including demands for worship, obedience, and\nallegiance. Finally, if God were to exist, complete privacy may be\nlost, as an omnsicient being could, presumably, know one’s thoughts\nand attitudes. \nKahane’s intricate argument is counter to the conventional view that\nGod’s existence is something that all should hope for, since this\nworld would, arguably, be the best or among the best of all possible\nworlds if God were to exist. Even so, Kahane argues that one could\nrationally prefer that God not exist.  The argument invovles a\ndistinction between evaluations from an impersonal viewpoint, and from\na personal viewpoint. It is the latter, which proves the most\npromising for the argument as Kahane contends that the existence of\nGod could undermine the meaning generating life-projects of some.  If\nhis argument is sound, Kahane has provided a kind of athiestic\npragmatic argument that one could prefer that God not exist, even if\nGod’s existence would render the world better overall than it\notherwise would be. \nMuch of Kahane’s argument consists of comparisons between possible\nworlds in which God exists (“Godly worlds”), and those in\nwhich God does not exist (“Godless worlds”).  The modal\nreliability of these comparisons is far from obvious, since God is\nstandardly seen as a necessarily existing being.
