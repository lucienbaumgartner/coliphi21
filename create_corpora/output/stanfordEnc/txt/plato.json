An Athenian citizen of high status, he displays in his\nworks his absorption in the political events and intellectual movements\nof his time, but the questions he raises are so profound and the\nstrategies he uses for tackling them so richly suggestive and\nprovocative that educated readers of nearly every period have in some\nway been influenced by him, and in practically every age there have\nbeen philosophers who count themselves Platonists in some important\nrespects. He was not the first thinker or writer to whom the word\n“philosopher” should be applied. But he was so\nself-conscious about how philosophy should be conceived, and what its\nscope and ambitions properly are, and he so transformed the\nintellectual currents with which he grappled, that the subject of\nphilosophy, as it is often conceived—a rigorous and systematic\nexamination of ethical, political, metaphysical, and epistemological\nissues, armed with a distinctive method—can be called his\ninvention. Few other authors in the history of Western philosophy approximate\nhim in depth and range: perhaps only Aristotle (who studied with him),\nAquinas, and Kant would be generally agreed to be of the same rank.\n\n\n\nMany people associate Plato with a few central doctrines that are\nadvocated in his writings: The world that appears to our senses is in\nsome way defective and filled with error, but there is a more real and\nperfect realm, populated by entities (called “forms” or\n“ideas”) that are eternal, changeless, and in some sense\nparadigmatic for the structure and character of the world presented to our senses. Among the\nmost important of these abstract objects (as they are now called,\nbecause they are not located in space or time) are goodness, beauty,\nequality, bigness, likeness, unity, being, sameness, difference,\nchange, and changelessness. (These terms—“goodness”, \n“beauty”, and so on—are\noften capitalized by those who write about Plato, in order to call\nattention to their exalted status; similarly for “Forms”\nand “Ideas.”) The most fundamental distinction in Plato's\nphilosophy is between the many observable objects that appear beautiful\n(good, just, unified, equal, big) and the one object that is what\nbeauty (goodness, justice, unity) really is, from which those many\nbeautiful (good, just, unified, equal, big) things receive their names\nand their corresponding characteristics. Nearly every major work of\nPlato is, in some way, devoted to or dependent on this distinction.\nMany of them explore the ethical and practical consequences of\nconceiving of reality in this bifurcated way. We are urged to transform\nour values by taking to heart the greater reality of the forms and the\ndefectiveness of the corporeal world. We must recognize that the soul\nis a different sort of object from the body—so much so that it\ndoes not depend on the existence of the body for its functioning, and\ncan in fact grasp the nature of the forms far more easily when it is\nnot encumbered by its attachment to anything corporeal. In a few of\nPlato's works, we are told that the soul always retains the ability to\nrecollect what it once grasped of the forms, when it was disembodied prior to its possessor's birth\n(see especially Meno), and that the lives we lead are to some\nextent a punishment or reward for choices we made in a previous\nexistence (see especially the final pages of Republic). But in\nmany of Plato's writings, it is asserted or assumed that true\nphilosophers—those who recognize how important it is to\ndistinguish the one (the one thing that goodness is, or virtue is, or\ncourage is) from the many (the many things that are called good or\nvirtuous or courageous )—are in a position to become ethically\nsuperior to unenlightened human beings, because of the greater degree\nof insight they can acquire. To understand which things are good and\nwhy they are good (and if we are not interested in such questions, how\ncan we become good?), we must investigate the form of good. \n\nAlthough these propositions are often identified by Plato's readers\nas forming a large part of the core of his philosophy, many of his\ngreatest admirers and most careful students point out that few, if any,\nof his writings can accurately be described as mere advocacy of a\ncut-and-dried group of propositions. Often Plato's works exhibit a\ncertain degree of dissatisfaction and puzzlement with even those\ndoctrines that are being recommended for our consideration. For\nexample, the forms are sometimes described as hypotheses (see for\nexample Phaedo). The form of good in particular is described\nas something of a mystery whose real nature is elusive and as yet\nunknown to anyone at all (Republic). Puzzles are raised—and not overtly\nanswered—about how any of the forms can be known and\nhow we are to talk about them without falling into contradiction\n(Parmenides), or about what it is to know anything\n(Theaetetus) or to name anything (Cratylus). When one\ncompares Plato with some of the other philosophers who are often ranked\nwith him—Aristotle, Aquinas, and Kant, for example—he\ncan be recognized to be far more exploratory, incompletely systematic,\nelusive, and playful than they. That, along with his gifts as a writer\nand as a creator of vivid character and dramatic setting, is one of the\nreasons why he is often thought to be the ideal author from whom one\nshould receive one's introduction to philosophy. His readers are not\npresented with an elaborate system of doctrines held to be so fully\nworked out that they are in no need of further exploration or\ndevelopment; instead, what we often receive from Plato is a few key\nideas together with a series of suggestions and problems about how\nthose ideas are to be interrogated and deployed. Readers of a Platonic\ndialogue are drawn into thinking for themselves about the issues\nraised, if they are to learn what the dialogue itself might be thought\nto say about them. Many of his works therefore give their readers a\nstrong sense of philosophy as a living and unfinished subject (perhaps\none that can never be completed) to which they themselves will have to\ncontribute. All of Plato's works are in some way meant to leave further\nwork for their readers, but among the ones that most conspicuously fall\ninto this category are: Euthyphro, Laches,\nCharmides, Euthydemus, Theaetetus, and\nParmenides. \n\nThere is another feature of Plato's writings that makes him\ndistinctive among the great philosophers and colors our experience of\nhim as an author. Nearly everything he wrote takes the form of a\ndialogue. (There is one striking exception: his Apology, which\npurports to be the speech that Socrates gave in his defense—the\nGreek word apologia means “defense”—when,\nin 399, he was legally charged and convicted of the crime of impiety.\nHowever, even there, Socrates is presented at one point addressing\nquestions of a philosophical character to his accuser, Meletus, and\nresponding to them. In addition, since antiquity, a collection of 13\nletters has been included among his collected works, but their\nauthenticity as compositions of Plato is not universally accepted among\nscholars, and many or most of them are almost certainly not his. Most\nof them purport to be the outcome of his involvement in the politics of\nSyracuse, a heavily populated Greek city located in Sicily and ruled by\ntyrants.) \n\nWe are of course familiar with the dialogue form through our\nacquaintance with the literary genre of drama. But Plato's dialogues do\nnot try to create a fictional world for the purposes of telling a\nstory, as many literary dramas do; nor do they invoke an earlier\nmythical realm, like the creations of the great Greek tragedians\nAeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Nor are they all presented in the\nform of a drama: in many of them, a single speaker narrates events in\nwhich he participated. They are philosophical discussions—“debates” \nwould, in some cases, also be an appropriate \nword—among a small number of interlocutors, many of whom can be\nidentified as real historical figures; and often they begin with a\ndepiction of the setting of the discussion—a visit to a prison,\na wealthy man's house, a celebration over drinks, a religious festival,\na visit to the gymnasium, a stroll outside the city's wall, a long walk\non a hot day. As a group, they form vivid portraits of a social world,\nand are not purely intellectual exchanges between characterless and\nsocially unmarked speakers. (At any rate, that is true of a large\nnumber of Plato's interlocutors. However, it must be added that in some\nof his works the speakers display little or no character. See, for\nexample, Sophist and Statesman—dialogues in\nwhich a visitor from the town of Elea in Southern Italy leads the\ndiscussion; and Laws, a discussion between an unnamed Athenian\nand two named fictional characters, one from Crete and the other from\nSparta.) In many of his dialogues (though not all), Plato is\nnot only attempting to draw his readers into a discussion, but is also\ncommenting on the social milieu that he is depicting, and criticizing\nthe character and ways of life of his interlocutors. Some of the\ndialogues that most evidently fall into this category are\nProtagoras, Gorgias, Hippias Major,\nEuthydemus, and Symposium. \n\nThere is one interlocutor who speaks in nearly all of Plato's\ndialogues, being completely absent only in Laws, which ancient\ntestimony tells us was one of his latest works: that figure is\nSocrates. Like nearly everyone else who appears in Plato's works, he is\nnot an invention of Plato: there really was a Socrates just as there really was a Crito, a Gorgias, a Thrasymachus, and a Laches. Plato was not\nthe only author whose personal experience of Socrates led to the\ndepiction of him as a character in one or more dramatic works. Socrates\nis one of the principal characters of Aristophanes' comedy,\nClouds; and Xenophon, a historian and military leader, wrote,\nlike Plato, both an Apology of Socrates (an account of\nSocrates' trial) and other works in which Socrates appears as a\nprincipal speaker. Furthermore, we have some fragmentary remains of\ndialogues written by other contemporaries of Socrates besides Plato and Xenophon (Aeschines,\nAntisthenes, Eucleides, Phaedo), and these purport to describe\nconversations he conducted with others. So, when Plato wrote dialogues\nthat feature Socrates as a principal speaker, he was both contributing\nto a genre that was inspired by the life of Socrates and participating\nin a lively literary debate about the kind of person Socrates was and\nthe value of the intellectual conversations in which he was involved.\nAristophanes' comic portrayal of Socrates is at the same time a bitter\ncritique of him and other leading intellectual figures of the day (the\n420s B.C.), but from Plato, Xenophon, and the other composers (in the\n390's and later) of “Socratic discourses” (as Aristotle\ncalls this body of writings) we receive a far more favorable\nimpression. \n\nEvidently, the historical Socrates was the sort of person who\nprovoked in those who knew him, or knew of him, a profound response,\nand he inspired many of those who came under his influence to write\nabout him. But the portraits composed by Aristophanes, Xenophon, and\nPlato are the ones that have survived intact, and they are therefore\nthe ones that must play the greatest role in shaping our conception of\nwhat Socrates was like. Of these, Clouds has the least value\nas an indication of what was distinctive of Socrates' mode of\nphilosophizing: after all, it is not intended as a philosophical work,\nand although it may contain a few lines that are characterizations of\nfeatures unique to Socrates, for the most part it is an attack on a\nphilosophical type—the long-haired, unwashed, amoral\ninvestigator into abstruse phenomena—rather than a\ndepiction of Socrates himself. Xenophon's depiction of Socrates,\nwhatever its value as historical testimony (which may be considerable),\nis generally thought to lack the philosophical subtlety and depth of\nPlato's. At any rate, no one (certainly not Xenophon himself) takes\nXenophon to be a major philosopher in his own right; when we read his\nSocratic works, we are not encountering a great philosophical mind. But\nthat is what we experience when we read Plato. We may read Plato's\nSocratic dialogues because we are (as Plato evidently wanted us to be)\ninterested in who Socrates was and what he stood for, but even if we\nhave little or no desire to learn about the historical Socrates, we\nwill want to read Plato because in doing so we are encountering an\nauthor of the greatest philosophical significance. No doubt he in some\nway borrowed in important ways from Socrates, though it is not easy to\nsay where to draw the line between him and his teacher (more about this\nbelow in section 12). But it is widely agreed among scholars that Plato\nis not a mere transcriber of the words of Socrates (any more than\nXenophon or the other authors of Socratic discourses). His use of a\nfigure called “Socrates” in so many of his dialogues should\nnot be taken to mean that Plato is merely preserving for a reading\npublic the lessons he learned from his teacher. \n\nSocrates, it should be kept in mind, does not appear in all of\nPlato's works. He makes no appearance in Laws, and there are\nseveral dialogues (Sophist, Statesman,\nTimaeus) in which his role is small and peripheral, while some\nother figure dominates the conversation or even, as in the\nTimaeus and Critias, presents a long and elaborate,\ncontinuous discourse of their own. Plato's dialogues are not a static\nliterary form; not only do his topics vary, not only do his speakers\nvary, but the role played by questions and answers is never the same\nfrom one dialogue to another. (Symposium, for example, is a\nseries of speeches, and there are also lengthy speeches in\nApology, Menexenus, Protagoras,\nCrito, Phaedrus, Timaeus, and\nCritias; in fact, one might reasonably question whether these\nworks are properly called dialogues). But even though Plato constantly\nadapted “the dialogue form” (a commonly used term, and\nconvenient enough, so long as we do not think of it as an unvarying\nunity) to suit his purposes, it is striking that throughout his career\nas a writer he never engaged in a form of composition that was widely\nused in his time and was soon to become the standard mode of\nphilosophical address: Plato never became a writer of philosophical\ntreatises, even though the writing of treatises (for example, on\nrhetoric, medicine, and geometry) was a common practice among his\npredecessors and contemporaries. (The closest we come to an exception\nto this generalization is the seventh letter, which contains a brief\nsection in which the author, Plato or someone pretending to be him, commits himself to several philosophical \npoints—while insisting, at the same time, that no philosopher will\nwrite about the deepest matters, but will communicate his thoughts only in private discussion with selected individuals. As noted above, the authenticity\nof Plato's letters is a matter of great controversy; and in any case,\nthe author of the seventh letter declares his opposition to the writing\nof philosophical books. Whether Plato wrote it or not, it cannot be\nregarded as a philosophical treatise, and its author did not wish it to\nbe so regarded.) In all of his writings—except in the letters,\nif any of them are genuine—Plato never speaks to his audience\ndirectly and in his own voice. Strictly speaking, he does not himself\naffirm anything in his dialogues; rather, it is the interlocutors in\nhis dialogues who are made by Plato to do all of the affirming,\ndoubting, questioning, arguing, and so on. Whatever he wishes to\ncommunicate to us is conveyed indirectly. \n\nThis feature of Plato's works raises important questions about how\nthey are to be read, and has led to considerable controversy among\nthose who study his writings. Since he does not himself affirm anything\nin any of his dialogues, can we ever be on secure ground in attributing\na philosophical doctrine to him (as opposed to one of his characters)?\nDid he himself have philosophical convictions, and can we discover what\nthey were? Are we justified in speaking of “the philosophy of\nPlato”? Or, if we attribute some view to Plato himself, are we\nbeing unfaithful to the spirit in which he intended the dialogues to be read? Is\nhis whole point, in refraining from writing treatises, to discourage the readers of his works from asking what their author believes\nand to encourage them instead simply to consider the plausibility or\nimplausibility of what his characters are saying? Is that why Plato\nwrote dialogues? If not for this reason, then what was his\npurpose in refraining from addressing his audience in a more direct\nway? There are other important questions about the particular shape his\ndialogues take: for example, why does Socrates play such a prominent\nrole in so many of them, and why, in some of these works, does Socrates\nplay a smaller role, or none at all? \n\nOnce these questions are raised and their difficulty acknowledged,\nit is tempting, in reading Plato's works and reflecting upon them, to\nadopt a strategy of extreme caution. Rather than commit oneself to any\nhypothesis about what he is trying to communicate to his readers, one\nmight adopt a stance of neutrality about his intentions, and confine\noneself to talking only about what is said by his dramatis\npersonae. One cannot be faulted, for example, if one notes\nthat, in Plato's Republic, Socrates argues that justice in the\nsoul consists in each part of the soul doing its own. It is equally\ncorrect to point out that other principal speakers in that work,\nGlaucon and Adeimantus, accept the arguments that Socrates gives for\nthat definition of justice. Perhaps there is no need for us to say \nmore—to say, for example, that Plato himself agrees that this is how\njustice should be defined, or that Plato himself accepts the arguments\nthat Socrates gives in support of this definition. And we might adopt\nthis same “minimalist” approach to all of Plato's\nworks. After all, is it of any importance to discover what went on\ninside his head as he wrote—to find out whether he himself\nendorsed the ideas he put in the mouths of his characters, whether they\nconstitute “the philosophy of Plato”? Should we not read\nhis works for their intrinsic philosophical value, and not as tools to\nbe used for entering into the mind of their author? We know what\nPlato's characters say—and isn't that all that we need, for the\npurpose of engaging with his works philosophically? \n\nBut the fact that we know what Plato's characters say does\nnot show that by refusing to entertain any hypotheses about what the\nauthor of these works is trying to communicate to his readers we can\nunderstand what those characters mean by what they say. We should\nnot lose sight of this obvious fact: it is Plato, not any of his\ndramatis personae, who is reaching out to a readership and\ntrying to influence their beliefs and actions by means of his literary\nactions. When we ask whether an argument put forward by a character in\nPlato's works should be read as an effort to persuade us of its\nconclusion, or is better read as a revelation of how foolish that\nspeaker is, we are asking about what Plato as author (not that\ncharacter) is trying to lead us to believe, through the writing that he\nis presenting to our attention. We need to interpret the work itself to\nfind out what it, or Plato the author, is saying. Similarly, when we\nask how a word that has several different senses is best understood, we\nare asking what Plato means to communicate to us through the speaker\nwho uses that word. We should not suppose that we can derive much\nphilosophical value from Plato's writings if we refuse to entertain any\nthoughts about what use he intends us to make of the things his\nspeakers say. Penetrating the mind of Plato and comprehending what his\ninterlocutors mean by what they say are not two separate tasks but one,\nand if we do not ask what his interlocutors mean by what they say, and\nwhat the dialogue itself indicates we should think about what they\nmean, we will not profit from reading his dialogues. \n\nFurthermore, the dialogues have certain characteristics that are\nmost easily explained by supposing that Plato is using them as vehicles\nfor inducing his readers to become convinced (or more convinced than\nthey already are) of certain propositions—for example, that\nthere are forms, that the soul is not corporeal, that knowledge can be\nacquired only by means of a study of the forms, and so on. Why, after\nall, did Plato write so many works (for example: Phaedo,\nSymposium, Republic, Phaedrus,\nTheaetetus, Sophist, Statesman,\nTimaeus, Philebus, Laws) in which one\ncharacter dominates the conversation (often, but not always, Socrates)\nand convinces the other speakers (at times, after encountering initial\nresistance) that they should accept or reject certain conclusions, on\nthe basis of the arguments presented? The only plausible way of\nanswering that question is to say that these dialogues were intended by\nPlato to be devices by which he might induce the audience for which\nthey are intended to reflect on and accept the arguments and\nconclusions offered by his principal interlocutor. (It is noteworthy\nthat in Laws, the principal speaker—an unnamed visitor\nfrom Athens—proposes that laws should be accompanied by\n“preludes” in which their philosophical basis is given as\nfull an explanation as possible. The educative value of written texts\nis thus explicitly acknowledged by Plato's dominant speaker. If\npreludes can educate a whole citizenry that is prepared to learn from\nthem, then surely Plato thinks that other sorts of written \ntexts—for example, his own dialogues—can also serve an\neducative function.) \n\nThis does not mean that Plato thinks that his readers can become\nwise simply by reading and studying his works. On the contrary, it is\nhighly likely that he wanted all of his writings to be supplementary\naids to philosophical conversation: in one of his works, he has\nSocrates warn his readers against relying solely on books, or taking\nthem to be authoritative. They are, Socrates says, best used as devices\nthat stimulate the readers' memory of discussions they have had\n(Phaedrus 274e-276d). In those face-to-face conversations with\na knowledgeable leader, positions are taken, arguments are given, and\nconclusions are drawn. Plato's writings, he implies in this passage\nfrom Phaedrus, will work best when conversational seeds have\nalready been sown for the arguments they contain. \n\nIf we take Plato to be trying to persuade us, in many of his works,\nto accept the conclusions arrived at by his principal interlocutors (or\nto persuade us of the refutations of their opponents), we can easily\nexplain why he so often chooses Socrates as the dominant speaker in his\ndialogues. Presumably the contemporary audience for whom Plato was\nwriting included many of Socrates' admirers. They would be predisposed\nto think that a character called “Socrates” would have all\nof the intellectual brilliance and moral passion of the historical\nperson after whom he is named (especially since Plato often makes\nspecial efforts to give his “Socrates” a life-like reality,\nand has him refer to his trial or to the characteristics by which he\nwas best known); and the aura surrounding the character called\n“Socrates” would give the words he speaks in the dialogue\nconsiderable persuasive power. Furthermore, if Plato felt strongly\nindebted to Socrates for many of his philosophical techniques and\nideas, that would give him further reason for assigning a dominant role\nto him in many of his works. (More about this in section 12.) \n\nOf course, there are other more speculative possible ways of\nexplaining why Plato so often makes Socrates his principal speaker. For\nexample, we could say that Plato was trying to undermine the reputation\nof the historical Socrates by writing a series of works in which a\nfigure called “Socrates” manages to persuade a group of\nnaïve and sycophantic interlocutors to accept absurd conclusions\non the basis of sophistries. But anyone who has read some of Plato's\nworks will quickly recognize the utter implausibility of that\nalternative way of reading them. Plato could have written into his\nworks clear signals to the reader that the arguments of Socrates do not\nwork, and that his interlocutors are foolish to accept them. But there\nare many signs in such works as Meno, Phaedo,\nRepublic, and Phaedrus that point in the opposite\ndirection. (And the great admiration Plato feels for Socrates is also\nevident from his Apology.) The reader is given every\nencouragement to believe that the reason why Socrates is successful in\npersuading his interlocutors (on those occasions when he does succeed)\nis that his arguments are powerful ones. The reader, in other words, is\nbeing encouraged by the author to accept those arguments, if not as\ndefinitive then at least as highly arresting and deserving of careful\nand full positive consideration. When we interpret the dialogues in\nthis way, we cannot escape the fact that we are entering into the mind\nof Plato, and attributing to him, their author, a positive evaluation\nof the arguments that his speakers present to each other. \n\nThere is a further reason for entertaining hypotheses about what\nPlato intended and believed, and not merely confining ourselves to\nobservations about what sorts of people his characters are and what\nthey say to each other. When we undertake a serious study of Plato, and\ngo beyond reading just one of his works, we are inevitably confronted\nwith the question of how we are to link the work we are currently\nreading with the many others that Plato composed. Admittedly, many of\nhis dialogues make a fresh start in their setting and their\ninterlocutors: typically, Socrates encounters a group of people many of\nwhom do not appear in any other work of Plato, and so, as an author, he\nneeds to give his readers some indication of their character and social\ncircumstances. But often Plato's characters make statements that would\nbe difficult for readers to understand unless they had already read one\nor more of his other works. For example, in Phaedo (73a-b),\nSocrates says that one argument for the immortality of the soul derives\nfrom the fact that when people are asked certain kinds of questions,\nand are aided with diagrams, they answer in a way that shows that they\nare not learning afresh from the diagrams or from information provided\nin the questions, but are drawing their knowledge of the answers from\nwithin themselves. That remark would be of little worth for an audience\nthat had not already read Meno. Several pages later, Socrates\ntells his interlocutors that his argument about our prior knowledge of\nequality itself (the form of equality) applies no less to other \nforms—to the beautiful, good, just, pious and to all the other things\nthat are involved in their asking and answering of questions (75d).\nThis reference to asking and answering questions would not be well\nunderstood by a reader who had not yet encountered a series of\ndialogues in which Socrates asks his interlocutors questions of the\nform, “What is X?” (Euthyphro: what is piety?\nLaches: what is courage? Charmides: What is\nmoderation? Hippias Major: what is beauty?). Evidently, Plato\nis assuming that readers of Phaedo have already read several\nof his other works, and will bring to bear on the current argument all\nof the lessons that they have learned from them. In some of his\nwritings, Plato's characters refer ahead to the continuation of their\nconversations on another day, or refer back to conversations they had\nrecently: thus Plato signals to us that we should read\nTheaetetus, Sophist, and Statesman\nsequentially; and similarly, since the opening of Timaeus\nrefers us back to Republic, Plato is indicating to his readers\nthat they must seek some connection between these two works. \n\nThese features of the dialogues show Plato's awareness that he\ncannot entirely start from scratch in every work that he writes. He\nwill introduce new ideas and raise fresh difficulties, but he will also\nexpect his readers to have already familiarized themselves with the\nconversations held by the interlocutors of other dialogues—even\nwhen there is some alteration among those interlocutors. (Meno does not\nre-appear in Phaedo; Timaeus was not among the interlocutors\nof Republic.) Why does Plato have his dominant characters\n(Socrates, the Eleatic visitor) reaffirm some of the same points from\none dialogue to another, and build on ideas that were made in earlier\nworks? If the dialogues were merely meant as provocations to \nthought—mere exercises for the mind—there would be no need for\nPlato to identify his leading characters with a consistent and\never-developing doctrine. For example, Socrates continues to maintain,\nover a large number of dialogues, that there are such things as\nforms—and there is no better explanation for this continuity\nthan to suppose that Plato is recommending that doctrine to his\nreaders. Furthermore, when Socrates is replaced as the principal\ninvestigator by the visitor from Elea (in Sophist and\nStatesman), the existence of forms continues to be taken for\ngranted, and the visitor criticizes any conception of reality that\nexcludes such incorporeal objects as souls and forms. The Eleatic\nvisitor, in other words, upholds a metaphysics that is, in many\nrespects, like the one that Socrates is made to defend. Again, the best\nexplanation for this continuity is that Plato is using both characters—Socrates and the Eleatic visitor—as devices for the\npresentation and defense of a doctrine that he embraces and wants his\nreaders to embrace as well. \n\nThis way of reading Plato's dialogues does not presuppose that he\nnever changes his mind about anything—that whatever any of his\nmain interlocutors uphold in one dialogue will continue to be\npresupposed or affirmed elsewhere without alteration. It is, in fact, a\ndifficult and delicate matter to determine, on the basis of our reading\nof the dialogues, whether Plato means to modify or reject in one\ndialogue what he has his main interlocutor affirm in some other. One of\nthe most intriguing and controversial questions about his treatment of\nthe forms, for example, is whether he concedes that his conception of\nthose abstract entities is vulnerable to criticism; and, if so, whether\nhe revises some of the assumptions he had been making about them, or\ndevelops a more elaborate picture of them that allows him to respond to\nthat criticism. In Parmenides, the principal interlocutor (not\nSocrates—he is here portrayed as a promising, young philosopher\nin need of further training—but rather the pre-Socratic from\nElea who gives the dialogue its name: Parmenides) subjects the forms to\nwithering criticism, and then consents to conduct an inquiry into the\nnature of oneness that has no overt connection to his critique of the\nforms. Does the discussion of oneness (a baffling series of\ncontradictions—or at any rate, propositions that seem, on the\nsurface, to be contradictions) in some way help address the problems\nraised about forms? That is one way of reading the dialogue. And if we\ndo read it in this way, does that show that Plato has changed his mind\nabout some of the ideas about forms he inserted into earlier dialogues?\nCan we find dialogues in which we encounter a “new theory of\nforms”—that is, a way of thinking of forms that carefully\nsteers clear of the assumptions about forms that led to Parmenides'\ncritique? It is not easy to say. But we cannot even raise this as an\nissue worth pondering unless we presuppose that behind the dialogues\nthere stands a single mind that is using these writings as a way of\nhitting upon the truth, and of bringing that truth to the attention of\nothers. If we find Timaeus (the principal interlocutor of the dialogue\nnamed after him) and the Eleatic visitor of the Sophist and\nStatesman talking about forms in a way that is entirely\nconsistent with the way Socrates talks about forms in Phaedo\nand Republic, then there is only one reasonable explanation\nfor that consistency: Plato believes that their way of talking about\nforms is correct, or is at least strongly supported by powerful\nconsiderations. If, on the other hand, we find that Timaeus or the\nEleatic visitor talks about forms in a way that does not harmonize with\nthe way Socrates conceives of those abstract objects, in the dialogues\nthat assign him a central role as director of the conversation, then\nthe most plausible explanation for these discrepancies is that Plato\nhas changed his mind about the nature of these entities. It would be\nimplausible to suppose that Plato himself had no convictions about\nforms, and merely wants to give his readers mental exercise by\ncomposing dialogues in which different leading characters talk about\nthese objects in discordant ways. \n\nThe same point—that we must view the dialogues as the\nproduct of a single mind, a single philosopher, though perhaps one who\nchanges his mind—can be made in connection with the politics of\nPlato's works. \n\nIt is noteworthy, to begin with, that Plato is, among other things,\na political philosopher. For he gives expression, in several\nof his writings (particular Phaedo), to a yearning to escape\nfrom the tawdriness of ordinary human relations. (Similarly, he evinces\na sense of the ugliness of the sensible world, whose beauty pales in\ncomparison with that of the forms.) Because of this, it would have been\nall too easy for Plato to turn his back entirely on practical reality,\nand to confine his speculations to theoretical questions. Some of his\nworks—Parmenides is a stellar example—do\nconfine themselves to exploring questions that seem to have no bearing\nwhatsoever on practical life. But it is remarkable how few of his works\nfall into this category. Even the highly abstract questions raised in\nSophist about the nature of being and not-being are, after\nall, embedded in a search for the definition of sophistry; and thus\nthey call to mind the question whether Socrates should be classified as\na sophist—whether, in other words, sophists are to be despised\nand avoided. In any case, despite the great sympathy Plato expresses\nfor the desire to shed one's body and live in an incorporeal world, he\ndevotes an enormous amount of energy to the task of understanding the\nworld we live in, appreciating its limited beauty, and improving\nit. \n\nHis tribute to the mixed beauty of the sensible world, in\nTimaeus, consists in his depiction of it as the outcome of\ndivine efforts to mold reality in the image of the forms, using simple\ngeometrical patterns and harmonious arithmetic relations as building\nblocks. The desire to transform human relations is given expression in\na far larger number of works. Socrates presents himself, in Plato's\nApology, as a man who does not have his head in the clouds\n(that is part of Aristophanes' charge against him in Clouds).\nHe does not want to escape from the everyday world but to make it\nbetter. He presents himself, in Gorgias, as the only Athenian\nwho has tried his hand at the true art of politics. \n\nSimilarly, the Socrates of Republic devotes a considerable\npart of his discussion to the critique of ordinary social \ninstitutions—the family, private property, and rule by the many. The\nmotivation that lies behind the writing of this dialogue is the desire\nto transform (or, at any rate, to improve) political life, not to\nescape from it (although it is acknowledged that the desire to escape\nis an honorable one: the best sort of rulers greatly prefer the\ncontemplation of divine reality to the governance of the city). And if\nwe have any further doubts that Plato does take an interest in the\npractical realm, we need only turn to Laws. A work of such\ngreat detail and length about voting procedures, punishments,\neducation, legislation, and the oversight of public officials can only\nhave been produced by someone who wants to contribute something to the\nimprovement of the lives we lead in this sensible and imperfect realm.\nFurther evidence of Plato's interest in practical matters can be drawn\nfrom his letters, if they are genuine. In most of them, he presents\nhimself as having a deep interest in educating (with the help of his\nfriend, Dion) the ruler of Syracuse, Dionysius II, and thus reforming\nthat city's politics. \n\nJust as any attempt to understand Plato's views about forms must\nconfront the question whether his thoughts about them developed or\naltered over time, so too our reading of him as a political philosopher\nmust be shaped by a willingness to consider the possibility that he\nchanged his mind. For example, on any plausible reading of\nRepublic, Plato evinces a deep antipathy to rule by the many.\nSocrates tells his interlocutors that the only politics that should\nengage them are those of the anti-democratic regime he depicts as the\nparadigm of a good constitution. And yet in Laws, the Athenian\nvisitor proposes a detailed legislative framework for a city in which\nnon-philosophers (people who have never heard of the forms, and have\nnot been trained to understand them) are given considerable powers as\nrulers. Plato would not have invested so much time in the creation of\nthis comprehensive and lengthy work, had he not believed that the\ncreation of a political community ruled by those who are\nphilosophically unenlightened is a project that deserves the support of\nhis readers. Has Plato changed his mind, then? Has he re-evaluated the\nhighly negative opinion he once held of those who are innocent of\nphilosophy? Did he at first think that the reform of existing Greek\ncities, with all of their imperfections, is a waste of time—but\nthen decide that it is an endeavor of great value? (And if so, what led\nhim to change his mind?) Answers to these questions can be justified\nonly by careful attention to what he has his interlocutors say. But it\nwould be utterly implausible to suppose that these developmental\nquestions need not be raised, on the grounds that Republic and\nLaws each has its own cast of characters, and that the two\nworks therefore cannot come into contradiction with each other.\nAccording to this hypothesis (one that must be rejected), because it is\nSocrates (not Plato) who is critical of democracy in Republic,\nand because it is the Athenian visitor (not Plato) who recognizes the\nmerits of rule by the many in Laws, there is no possibility\nthat the two dialogues are in tension with each other. Against this\nhypothesis, we should say: Since both Republic and\nLaws are works in which Plato is trying to move his readers\ntowards certain conclusions, by having them reflect on certain\narguments—these dialogues are not barred from having this\nfeature by their use of interlocutors—it would be an evasion of\nour responsibility as readers and students of Plato not to ask whether\nwhat one of them advocates is compatible with what the other advocates.\nIf we answer that question negatively, we have some explaining to do:\nwhat led to this change? Alternatively, if we conclude that the two\nworks are compatible, we must say why the appearance of conflict is\nillusory. \n\nMany contemporary scholars find it plausible that when Plato\nembarked on his career as a philosophical writer, he composed, in\naddition to his Apology of Socrates, a number of short ethical\ndialogues that contain little or nothing in the way of positive\nphilosophical doctrine, but are mainly devoted to portraying the way in\nwhich Socrates punctured the pretensions of his interlocutors and\nforced them to realize that they are unable to offer satisfactory\ndefinitions of the ethical terms they used, or satisfactory arguments\nfor their moral beliefs. According to this way of placing the dialogues\ninto a rough chronological order—associated especially with\nGregory Vlastos's name (see especially his Socrates Ironist and\nMoral Philosopher, chapters 2 and 3)—Plato, at this point\nof his career, was content to use his writings primarily for the\npurpose of preserving the memory of Socrates and making plain the\nsuperiority of his hero, in intellectual skill and moral seriousness,\nto all of his contemporaries—particularly those among them who\nclaimed to be experts on religious, political, or moral matters. Into\nthis category of early dialogues (they are also sometimes called\n“Socratic” dialogues, possibly without any intended chronological connotation) are placed: Charmides,\nCrito, Euthydemus, Euthyphro,\nGorgias, Hippias Major, Hippias\nMinor, Ion, Laches, Lysis, and\nProtagoras, (Some scholars hold that we can tell which of\nthese come later during Plato's early period. For example, it is\nsometimes said that Protagoras and Gorgias are later,\nbecause of their greater length and philosophical complexity. Other\ndialogues—for example, Charmides and Lysis—are \nthought not to be among Plato's earliest within this early group,\nbecause in them Socrates appears to be playing a more active role in\nshaping the progress of the dialogue: that is, he has more ideas of his\nown.) In comparison with many of Plato's other dialogues, these\n“Socratic” works contain little in the way of metaphysical,\nepistemological, or methodological speculation, and they therefore fit\nwell with the way Socrates characterizes himself in Plato's\nApology: as a man who leaves investigations of high\nfalutin’ matters (which are “in the sky and below the\nearth”) to wiser heads, and confines all of his investigations to\nthe question how one should live one's life. Aristotle describes\nSocrates as someone whose interests were restricted to only one branch\nof philosophy—the realm of the ethical; and he also says that\nhe was in the habit of asking definitional questions to which he\nhimself lacked answers (Metaphysics 987b1, Sophistical\nRefutations 183b7). That testimony gives added weight to the\nwidely accepted hypothesis that there is a group of dialogues—the\nones mentioned above as his early works, whether or not they were all written early in Plato's writing career—in which Plato used\nthe dialogue form as a way of portraying the philosophical activities\nof the historical Socrates (although, of course, he might also have\nused them in other ways as well—for example to suggest and\nbegin to explore philosophical difficulties raised by them). \n\nBut at a certain point—so says this hypothesis about the\nchronology of the dialogues—Plato began to use his works to\nadvance ideas that were his own creations rather than those of\nSocrates, although he continued to use the name “Socrates”\nfor the interlocutor who presented and argued for these new ideas. The\nspeaker called “Socrates” now begins to move beyond and\ndepart from the historical Socrates: he has views about the methodology\nthat should be used by philosophers (a methodology borrowed from\nmathematics), and he argues for the immortality of the soul and the\nexistence and importance of the forms of beauty, justice, goodness, and\nthe like. (By contrast, in Apology Socrates says that no one\nknows what becomes of us after we die.) Phaedo is often said\nto be the dialogue in which Plato first comes into his own as a\nphilosopher who is moving far beyond the ideas of his teacher (though\nit is also commonly said that we see a new methodological\nsophistication and a greater interest in mathematical knowledge in\nMeno). Having completed all of the dialogues that, according\nto this hypothesis, we characterize as early, Plato widened the range\nof topics to be explored in his writings (no longer confining himself\nto ethics), and placed the theory of forms (and related ideas about\nlanguage, knowledge, and love) at the center of his thinking. In these\nworks of his “middle” period—for example, in\nPhaedo, Cratylus, Symposium,\nRepublic, and Phaedrus—there is both a change\nof emphasis and of doctrine. The focus is no longer on ridding\nourselves of false ideas and self-deceit; rather, we are asked to\naccept (however tentatively) a radical new conception of ourselves (now\ndivided into three parts), our world—or rather, our two \nworlds—and our need to negotiate between them. Definitions of the most\nimportant virtue terms are finally proposed in Republic (the\nsearch for them in some of the early dialogues having been\nunsuccessful): Book I of this dialogue is a portrait of how the\nhistorical Socrates might have handled the search for a definition of\njustice, and the rest of the dialogue shows how the new ideas and tools\ndiscovered by Plato can complete the project that his teacher was\nunable to finish. Plato continues to use a figure called\n“Socrates” as his principal interlocutor, and in this way\nhe creates a sense of continuity between the methods, insights, and\nideals of the historical Socrates and the new Socrates who has now\nbecome a vehicle for the articulation of his own new philosophical outlook.\nIn doing so, he acknowledges his intellectual debt to his teacher and\nappropriates for his own purposes the extraordinary prestige of the man\nwho was the wisest of his time. \n\nThis hypothesis about the chronology of Plato's writings has a third\ncomponent: it does not place his works into either of only two\ncategories—the early or “Socratic” dialogues, and\nall the rest—but works instead with a threefold division of\nearly, middle, and late. That is because, following ancient testimony,\nit has become a widely accepted assumption that Laws is one of\nPlato's last works, and further that this dialogue shares a great many\nstylistic affinities with a small group of others: Sophist,\nStatesman, Timaeus, Critias, and\nPhilebus. These five dialogues together with Laws are\ngenerally agreed to be his late works, because they have much more in\ncommon with each other, when one counts certain stylistic features\napparent only to readers of Plato's Greek, than with any of Plato's\nother works. (Computer counts have aided these stylometric studies, but\nthe isolation of a group of six dialogues by means of their stylistic\ncommonalities was recognized in the nineteenth century.) \n\nIt is not at all clear whether there are one or more\nphilosophical affinities among this group of six \ndialogues—that is, whether the philosophy they contain is sharply\ndifferent from that of all of the other dialogues. Plato does nothing\nto encourage the reader to view these works as a distinctive and\nseparate component of his thinking. On the contrary, he links\nSophist with Theaetetus (the conversations they\npresent have a largely overlapping cast of characters, and take place\non successive days) no less than Sophist and\nStatesman. Sophist contains, in its opening pages, a\nreference to the conversation of Parmenides—and\nperhaps Plato is thus signaling to his readers that they should bring\nto bear on Sophist the lessons that are to be drawn from\nParmenides. Similarly, Timaeus opens with a reminder\nof some of the principal ethical and political doctrines of Republic. It could be\nargued, of course, that when one looks beyond these stage-setting\ndevices, one finds significant philosophical changes in the six late\ndialogues, setting this group off from all that preceded them. But\nthere is no consensus that they should be read in this way. Resolving\nthis issue requires intensive study of the content of Plato's works.\nSo, although it is widely accepted that the six dialogues mentioned\nabove belong to Plato's latest period, there is, as yet, no agreement\namong students of Plato that these six form a distinctive stage in his\nphilosophical development. \n\nIn fact, it remains a matter of dispute whether the division of\nPlato's works into three periods—early, middle, late—does\ncorrectly indicate the order of composition, and whether it is a\nuseful tool for the understanding of his thought (See Cooper 1997,\nvii–xxvii). Of course, it would be wildly implausible to suppose\nthat Plato's writing career began with such complex works\nas Laws, Parmenides,\nPhaedrus, or Republic. In light of widely accepted\nassumptions about how most philosophical minds develop, it is likely\nthat when Plato started writing philosophical works some of the shorter\nand simpler dialogues were the ones he composed: Laches, or\nCrito, or Ion (for example). (Similarly,\nApology does not advance a complex philosophical agenda or\npresuppose an earlier body of work; so that too is likely to have been\ncomposed near the beginning of Plato's writing career.) Even so, there\nis no good reason to eliminate the hypothesis that throughout much of\nhis life Plato devoted himself to writing two sorts of dialogues at the\nsame time, moving back and forth between them as he aged: on the one\nhand, introductory works whose primary purpose is to show readers the\ndifficulty of apparently simple philosophical problems, and thereby to\nrid them of their pretensions and false beliefs; and on the other hand,\nworks filled with more substantive philosophical theories supported by\nelaborate argumentation. Moreover, one could point to features of many\nof the “Socratic” dialogues that would justify putting\nthem in the latter category, even though the argumentation does not\nconcern metaphysics or methodology or invoke mathematics—Gorgias, \nProtagoras, Lysis,\nEuthydemus, Hippias Major among them. \n\nPlato makes it clear that both of these processes, one preceding the\nother, must be part of one's philosophical education. One of his\ndeepest methodological convictions (affirmed in Meno,\nTheaetetus, and Sophist) is that in order to make\nintellectual progress we must recognize that knowledge cannot be\nacquired by passively receiving it from others: rather, we must work\nour way through problems and assess the merits of competing theories\nwith an independent mind. Accordingly, some of his dialogues are\nprimarily devices for breaking down the reader's complacency, and that\nis why it is essential that they come to no positive conclusions;\nothers are contributions to theory-construction, and are therefore best\nabsorbed by those who have already passed through the first stage of\nphilosophical development. We should not assume that Plato could have\nwritten the preparatory dialogues only at the earliest stage of his\ncareer. Although he may well have begun his writing career by taking up\nthat sort of project, he may have continued writing these\n“negative” works at later stages, at the same time that he\nwas composing his theory-constructing dialogues. For example although\nboth Euthydemus and Charmides are widely assumed to\nbe early dialogues, they might have been written around the same time\nas Symposium and Republic, which are generally\nassumed to be compositions of his middle period—or even\nlater. \n\nNo doubt, some of the works widely considered to be early really are\nsuch. But it is an open question which and how many of them are. At any\nrate, it is clear that Plato continued to write in a\n“Socratic” and “negative” vein even after he\nwas well beyond the earliest stages of his career: Theaetetus\nfeatures a Socrates who is even more insistent upon his ignorance than\nare the dramatic representations of Socrates in briefer and\nphilosophically less complex works that are reasonably assumed to be\nearly; and like many of those early works, Theaetetus seeks\nbut does not find the answer to the “what is it?” question\nthat it relentlessly pursues—“What is knowledge?”\nSimilarly, Parmenides, though certainly not an early dialogue,\nis a work whose principal aim is to puzzle the reader by the\npresentation of arguments for apparently contradictory conclusions;\nsince it does not tell us how it is possible to accept all of those\nconclusions, its principal effect on the reader is similar to that of\ndialogues (many of them no doubt early) that reach only negative\nconclusions. Plato uses this educational device—provoking the\nreader through the presentation of opposed arguments, and leaving the\ncontradiction unresolved—in Protagoras (often\nconsidered an early dialogue) as well. So it is clear that even after\nhe was well beyond the earliest stages of his thinking, he continued to\nassign himself the project of writing works whose principal aim is the\npresentation of unresolved difficulties. (And, just as we should\nrecognize that puzzling the reader continues to be his aim even in\nlater works, so too we should not overlook the fact that there is some\nsubstantive theory-construction in the ethical works that are simple\nenough to have been early compositions: Ion, for example,\naffirms a theory of poetic inspiration; and Crito sets out the\nconditions under which a citizen acquires an obligation to obey civic\ncommands. Neither ends in failure.) \n\nIf we are justified in taking Socrates' speech in Plato's\nApology to constitute reliable evidence about what the\nhistorical Socrates was like, then whatever we find in Plato's other\nworks that is of a piece with that speech can also be safely attributed\nto Socrates. So understood, Socrates was a moralist but (unlike Plato)\nnot a metaphysician or epistemologist or cosmologist. That fits with\nAristotle's testimony, and Plato's way of choosing the dominant speaker\nof his dialogues gives further support to this way of distinguishing\nbetween him and Socrates. The number of dialogues that are dominated by\na Socrates who is spinning out elaborate philosophical doctrines is\nremarkably small: Phaedo, Republic,\nPhaedrus, and Philebus. All of them are dominated by\nethical issues: whether to fear death, whether to be just, whom to\nlove, the place of pleasure. Evidently, Plato thinks that it is\nappropriate to make Socrates the major speaker in a dialogue that is\nfilled with positive content only when the topics explored in that work\nprimarily have to do with the ethical life of the individual. (The\npolitical aspects of Republic are explicitly said to serve the\nlarger question whether any individual, no matter what his\ncircumstances, should be just.) When the doctrines he wishes to present\nsystematically become primarily metaphysical, he turns to a visitor\nfrom Elea (Sophist, Statesman); when they become\ncosmological, he turns to Timaeus; when they become constitutional, he\nturns, in Laws, to a visitor from Athens (and he then\neliminates Socrates entirely). In effect, Plato is showing us: although\nhe owes a great deal to the ethical insights of Socrates, as well as to\nhis method of puncturing the intellectual pretensions of his\ninterlocutors by leading them into contradiction, he thinks he should\nnot put into the mouth of his teacher too elaborate an exploration of\nontological, or cosmological, or political themes, because Socrates\nrefrained from entering these domains. This may be part of the\nexplanation why he has Socrates put into the mouth of the personified\nLaws of Athens the theory advanced in Crito, which reaches the\nconclusion that it would be unjust for him to escape from prison.\nPerhaps Plato is indicating, at the point where these speakers enter\nthe dialogue, that none of what is said here is in any way derived from\nor inspired by the conversation of Socrates. \n\nJust as we should reject the idea that Plato must have made a\ndecision, at a fairly early point in his career, no longer to write one\nkind of dialogue (negative, destructive, preparatory) and to write only\nworks of elaborate theory-construction; so we should also question\nwhether he went through an early stage during which he refrained from\nintroducing into his works any of his own ideas (if he had any), but\nwas content to play the role of a faithful portraitist, representing to\nhis readers the life and thought of Socrates. It is unrealistic to\nsuppose that someone as original and creative as Plato, who probably\nbegan to write dialogues somewhere in his thirties (he was around 28\nwhen Socrates was killed), would have started his compositions with no\nideas of his own, or, having such ideas, would have decided to suppress\nthem, for some period of time, allowing himself to think for himself\nonly later. (What would have led to such a decision?) We should instead\ntreat the moves made in the dialogues, even those that are likely to be\nearly, as Platonic inventions—derived, no doubt, by Plato's\nreflections on and transformations of the key themes of Socrates that\nhe attributes to Socrates in Apology. That speech indicates,\nfor example, that the kind of religiosity exhibited by Socrates was\nunorthodox and likely to give offense or lead to misunderstanding. It\nwould be implausible to suppose that Plato simply concocted the idea\nthat Socrates followed a divine sign, especially because Xenophon too attributes this to his Socrates. But what of the various\nphilosophical moves rehearsed in Euthyphro—the\ndialogue in which Socrates searches, unsuccessfully, for an\nunderstanding of what piety is? We have no good reason to think that in\nwriting this work Plato adopted the role of a mere recording device, or\nsomething close to it (changing a word here and there, but for the most\npart simply recalling what he heard Socrates say, as he made his way to\ncourt). It is more likely that Plato, having been inspired by the\nunorthodoxy of Socrates' conception of piety, developed, on his own, a\nseries of questions and answers designed to show his readers how\ndifficult it is to reach an understanding of the central concept that\nSocrates' fellow citizens relied upon when they condemned him to death.\nThe idea that it is important to search for definitions may have been\nSocratic in origin. (After all, Aristotle attributes this much to\nSocrates.) But the twists and turns of the arguments in\nEuthyphro and other dialogues that search for definitions are\nmore likely to be the products of Plato's mind than the content of\nany conversations that really took place. \n\nIt is equally unrealistic to suppose that when Plato embarked on his\ncareer as a writer, he made a conscious decision to put all of the\ncompositions that he would henceforth compose for a general reading\npublic (with the exception of Apology) in the form of a\ndialogue. If the question, “why did Plato write\ndialogues?”, which many of his readers are tempted to ask,\npre-supposes that there must have been some such once-and-for-all\ndecision, then it is poorly posed. It makes better sense to break that\nquestion apart into many little ones: better to ask, “Why did\nPlato write this particular work (for example:\nProtagoras, or Republic, or Symposium, or\nLaws) in the form of a dialogue—and that one\n(Timaeus, say) mostly in the form of a long and\nrhetorically elaborate single speech?” than to ask why he decided\nto adopt the dialogue form. \n\nThe best way to form a reasonable conjecture about why Plato wrote\nany given work in the form of a dialogue is to ask: what would be lost,\nwere one to attempt to re-write this work in a way that eliminated the\ngive-and-take of interchange, stripped the characters of their\npersonality and social markers, and transformed the result into\nsomething that comes straight from the mouth of its author? This is\noften a question that will be easy to answer, but the answer might vary\ngreatly from one dialogue to another. In pursuing this strategy, we\nmust not rule out the possibility that some of Plato's reasons for\nwriting this or that work in the form of a dialogue will also be his\nreason for doing so in other cases—perhaps some of his reasons,\nso far as we can guess at them, will be present in all other cases. For\nexample, the use of character and conversation allows an author to\nenliven his work, to awaken the interest of his readership, and\ntherefore to reach a wider audience. The enormous appeal of Plato's\nwritings is in part a result of their dramatic composition. Even\ntreatise-like compositions—Timaeus and Laws,\nfor example—improve in readability because of their\nconversational frame. Furthermore, the dialogue form allows Plato's\nevident interest in pedagogical questions (how is it possible to learn?\nwhat is the best way to learn? from what sort of person can we learn?\nwhat sort of person is in a position to learn?) to be pursued not only\nin the content of his compositions but also in their form. Even in\nLaws such questions are not far from Plato's mind, as he\ndemonstrates, through the dialogue form, how it is possible for the\ncitizens of Athens, Sparta, and Crete to learn from each other by\nadapting and improving upon each other's social and political\ninstitutions. \n\nIn some of his works, it is evident that one of Plato's goals is to\ncreate a sense of puzzlement among his readers, and that the dialogue\nform is being used for this purpose. The Parmenides is perhaps\nthe clearest example of such a work, because here Plato relentlessly\nrubs his readers' faces in a baffling series of unresolved puzzles and\napparent contradictions. But several of his other works also have this\ncharacter, though to a smaller degree: for example, Protagoras\n(can virtue be taught?), Hippias Minor (is voluntary\nwrongdoing better than involuntary wrongdoing?), and portions of\nMeno (are some people virtuous because of divine\ninspiration?). Just as someone who encounters Socrates in conversation\nshould sometimes be puzzled about whether he means what he says (or\nwhether he is instead speaking ironically), so Plato sometimes uses the\ndialogue form to create in his readers a similar sense of discomfort\nabout what he means and what we ought to infer from the arguments that\nhave been presented to us. But Socrates does not always speak\nironically, and similarly Plato's dialogues do not always aim\nat creating a sense of bafflement about what we are to think about the\nsubject under discussion. There is no mechanical rule for discovering\nhow best to read a dialogue, no interpretive strategy that applies\nequally well to all of his works. We will best understand Plato's works\nand profit most from our reading of them if we recognize their great\ndiversity of styles and adapt our way of reading accordingly. Rather\nthan impose on our reading of Plato a uniform expectation of what he\nmust be doing (because he has done such a thing elsewhere), we should\nbring to each dialogue a receptivity to what is unique to it.\nThat would be the most fitting reaction to the artistry in his\nphilosophy.","contact.mail":"rkraut1@northwestern.edu","contact.domain":"northwestern.edu"}]
