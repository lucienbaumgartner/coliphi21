One\nof the three major representatives of early Neoplatonism (the third\none being Plotinus himself), he exerted considerable influence among\nlater philosophers belonging to the same tradition, such as Proclus,\nDamascius, and Simplicius. His work as a Pagan theologian and exegete\nearned him high praise and made a decisive contribution to the\ntransformation of Plotinian metaphysics into the full-fledged system\nof the fifth-century school of Athens, at that time the major school\nof philosophy, along with the one in Alexandria. His harsh critique of\nPlotinus’ philosophical tenets is linked to his pessimistic\noutlook on the condition of the human soul, as well as to his advocacy\nof salvation by ritual means, known as “theurgy”.\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle is known about Iamblichus’ life and career, since\nEunapius of Sardis’ biography of Iamblichus (Lives of\nPhilosophers and Sophists V [Goulet 2014]) is merely\nhagiographical in nature. His birthplace is traditionally taken to be\nChalcis ad Belum (modern Qinnasrin), although support has recently\nbeen voiced in favor of a different Chalcis, Chalcis sub Libanum\n(Aliquot 2010: 307 and n. 7). What is uncontroversial is that\nIamblichus hailed from a very influential Syrian family, the\nSampsigeramids of Emesa (Damascius, Philosophical History,\nAthanassiadi 1999: 334.10–14 [Zintzen 1967: 2.8–10]), who had gained\naccess to the Imperial throne along with Elagabalus\n(218–222). \nEunapius gives Anatolius and then Porphyry as Iamblichus’ two\nteachers, and there are no decisive reasons to doubt this: on the one\nhand, it is evident that he was influenced by the kind of theological\narithmology Anatolius championed; on the other hand, Porphyry\ndedicated his treatise On the “Know thyself” to\nIamblichus (Stobaeus, Anthology III, 21, 26) and provides\ninformation about the philosopher’s son (Life of\nPlotinus 9). Since this son is said by Porphyry to have married a\nRoman aristocrat, it is very likely that Iamblichus studied in Rome\nunder Porphyry, who would have carried on the philosophical circle\nPlotinus had founded in 244. Dalsgaard Larsen’s (DL-1972: I,\n38–39) supposition of a prolonged stay at Alexandria is dubious\nat best. \nAfter a break with Porphyry that seems impossible to date with\nprecision, Iamblichus settled in Syria. Although he is known to have\nowned an estate in Antioch’s suburb of Daphne, it is now\naccepted that he settled in Apamea, where Plotinus’ first\ndisciple Amelius had previously moved. There, welcomed by a wealthy\nnotable, Sopater, he founded a flourishing school: we know about a\ndozen of his students (see below,\n Section 2.4),\n among whom the most conspicuous are Sopater himself, who died\nbecause of a plot at Constantine’s court; Aedesius, who moved\nthe school to Pergamon; and Dexippus, the only disciple of whom we\nstill have a philosophical work (a commentary on Aristotle’s\nCategories). Apart from Eunapius, evidence about\nIamblichus’ whereabouts in Apamea is to be found mainly in\nLibanius (e.g. Ep. 1389.13–14) and, above all, in the\nletters by an anonymous Syrian sophist\nwhose correspondence with Iamblichus was\npreserved among the genuine letters of the emperor Julian (e.g. Pseudo-Julian, Ep. 78 and 79 Wright). \nFew of Iamblichus’ works are preserved in the direct manuscript\ntradition. Four of these texts pertain to a summa On\nPythagoreanism (conflicting testimonies exist about its title:\ncf. O’Meara 1989: 32–33): On the Pythagorean\nLife; the Protrepticus; On General Mathematical\nScience; and an Introduction to Arithmetic based on\nNicomachus of Gerasa’s treatise of the same name. Sadly, they\nare for the most part impersonal works: the Protrepticus\nconsists in lengthy quotations from previous hortatory literature, and\nits interest mostly lies in the fact that it provides evidence for\nvaluable lost works (most notably Aristotle’s own\nProtrepticus and the so-called Anonymus Iamblichi),\nwhile On the Pythagorean Life plagiarizes previous\nbiographies of the master, although it certainly contains valuable\ninsights on Iamblichus’ conception of the “divine\nman”. Neither of these works seems to have had any impact over\nthe subsequent course of philosophy, whereas On General\nMathematical Science was at least a formative influence on\nProclus’ commentary to Euclid’s Elements, as well\nas on Syrianus’ commentary on Metaphysics\nΜ–Ν. It also\nprovides the basic material for the reconstruction of\nIamblichus’ philosophy of mathematics (see below,\n Section 4).\n For a general characterization of On Pythagoreanism and its\ncontext, see Huffman (2006 [2019: sect. 4.4]). \nThe most important extant treatise by Iamblichus, however, is the\nReply of Master Abamon to Porphyry’s Letter to Anebo, and\nSolutions to the Difficulties Contained Therein (abbreviated to\nReply to Porphyry and traditionally known as De mysteriis\nÆgyptiorum since Marsilio Ficino’s original Latin\ntranslation: see SS-2013: ix–xxi). The work is a defense of\nPagan religious practice (sacrifice, prayer, divination etc.) against\nthe objections raised by Porphyry, and to serve this purpose it\nintroduces several philosophical developments on the divine nature and\norders, as well as the pretensions of the human soul. The whole debate\nis framed with a fictional Egyptian scenario: Porphyry had raised his\nobjections in an epistle addressed to Anebo, an Egyptian priest, while\nIamblichus wrote his reply under the assumed guise of the Egyptian\nprophet Abamon. While it had limited direct transmission (the only\nancient testimonium being Proclus, In Timaeum I,\n386.8–13 [D-1973: Fr. 38], although Taormina (2014) expressed\nreservations), its importance as a touchstone against which one can\nsafely compare what can be gathered from other sources is\ninvaluable. \nThe bulk of what remains of Iamblichus’ work consists in approx.\n800 fragments and testimonia. Of these, the extensive excerpts given\nby Stobaeus of a work On the Soul as well as a dozen\nLetters, which have been the object of multiple independent\neditions, stand out as the most coherent, if not necessarily the most\noriginal. By far the most influential part of his philosophical\noutput, his Commentaries on key works by Plato and Aristotle\nare all lost, although in almost two cases (his commentary on the\nCategories, transmitted by Simplicius; that on the\nTimaeus, transmitted by Proclus), quotations are so numerous\nthat one can safely establish the main features of the exegesis given.\nOf the other works Iamblichus wrote commentaries on, the most\nimportant ones are the Alcibiades, the Philebus and\nthe Parmenides, while the existence of a separate, continuous\ncommentary on Aristotle’s De anima was questioned by\nBlumenthal (1974). A richly annotated edition of the Platonic\nfragments was given by D-1973, while DL-1972 collected all fragments\nknown to Dalsgaard Larsen as an appendix to his monograph, although\nhis work can barely be described as an edition. Another collection\nfocusing on Aristotelian exegesis was recently produced by Romano\n[R-2012]. \nIamblichus’ significance in Late Antique philosophy can hardly\nbe overestimated. Karl Praechter described him as the second founder\nof Neoplatonism after Plotinus and argued that Iamblichus’\nposition was similar to that of Chrysippus in ancient Stoicism\n(Praechter 1910: 143). This statement aptly expresses\nIamblichus’ historical and philosophical significance, but needs\nmuch qualification: unlike the Stoa, “Neoplatonism” is not\nan ancient philosophical school, but a modern historical category\n(whose reliability scholars are sometimes inclined to question: see\nCatana 2013). Iamblichus is likely, as was mentioned above\n (Section 1.1)\n to have been a student of Porphyry who was, in turn, a student of\nPlotinus. Iamblichus’ school was, however, completely separate\nfrom that of Plotinus, both in time and in place: consequently,\ndespite late, ideological attempts to reconstruct a continuous\n“golden chain” of Neoplatonist exegetes (see, e.g.,\nHierocles, De Providentia, apud Photius cod. 214,\n173 a; Proclus, Platonic Theology I, p. 6.16–7.8),\nthere is no institutional continuity between Plotinus and Iamblichus\nand, from this point of view, the situation is obviously different\nfrom that of the ancient Stoa. Iamblichus is not the second founder of\nthe Neoplatonic school for the simple reason that there is no unitary\nNeoplatonic school in Late Antiquity. What scholars call Greek\nNeoplatonism is actually a multifaceted philosophical movement that\ncovers some three centuries and includes several schools scattered\nthroughout the Roman Empire: these schools certainly shared doctrines\nand methods, but their relations were sometimes close, sometimes much\nmore tenuous. Certainly, Iamblichus accepts and further develops some\ndistinctive features of Plotinus’ philosophy and he can be seen\nas a follower of Plotinus and Porphyry: this holds in particular for\nIamblichus’ general metaphysical and philosophical approach, for\nhis account of the One and of the first principles, for his exegesis\nof some works such as Plato’s Parmenides and\nAristotle’s Categories. On the other hand,\nIamblichus’ original position vis-à-vis Plotinus\nand Porphyry emerges clearly with respect to both his theories and his\nmethods (see Taormina 1999). \nOne of the most conspicuous of Iamblichus’ contributions to\nemerging Neoplatonism regards his views on exegesis. A typical Late\nAntique intellectual in this respect, Iamblichus considers the written\nwork of authoritative figures to be sacred and claims to be a mere\ninterpreter of their true, deeper meaning (nous). \nFour overarching principles govern Iamblichus’ exegetical\npractice. First, the idea that every authoritative work is fully\nself-consistent and strives to demonstrate a certain thesis which acts\nas its “goal” or “target” (skopos).\nThis principle is applied rigorously: for instance, since the\nskopos of the Timaeus is the theory of nature, this\nmeans that even the work’s prologue, however autonomous it may\nseem at first glance, should be interpreted in this way (In\nTimaeum [D-1973: Fr. 3]). This amounts to considering literary\nworks living organisms, in accordance with what Plato writes in\nPhaedrus 264C (see Coulter 1976: 73). Guidelines to\ndetermining a given work’s skopos are found in a late\nanonymous composition, the Prolegomena to Platonic Philosophy\n(§§ 21–23). \nThe same source (§ 26) provides a list of twelve Platonic\ndialogues (10 + 2) which, according to Iamblichus, offer an overview\nof his philosophy and thus encompass the whole theory of reality. The\nlist starts with the Alcibiades, taken as an introduction to\nphilosophy and thought to contain the first ten dialogues, as if it\nwere a “seed” (In Alcibiadem [D-1973: Fr. 1).\nThe remaining dialogues are subsequently arranged according to the\ndifferent branches of philosophy (as Porphyry had done with\nPlotinus’ Enneads), while the Aristotelian distinction\nbetween praxis and theōria is simultaneously\ntaken into account. Praxis or ethics is exemplified by the\nGorgias and the Phaedo, the former representing\npolitics, the latter catharsis (in accordance with Iamblichus’\nconception of virtues, on which see below,\n Section 7.2).\n Then comes theōria where, as it seems, the\nCratylus and the Theaetetus are taken to provide\nPlato’s account of logic (the former teaching names, the latter\nconcepts); then come the Sophist and the Politicus,\nwhich supposedly deal with physics—however strange this may seem\nto us—and finally the Phaedrus and the\nSymposium, which deal with theology. The crowning dialogue in\nthe first cycle is the Philebus, because its skopos\nis the all-transcendent Good. Then, as a recapitulation of the first\ncycle, we find a second one consisting in only two works (both of\nwhich, remarkably, feature main characters other than Socrates): the\nTimaeus and the Parmenides, the former subordinated\nto the latter as physics is to theology, although both display a\ndegree of perfection and thus are expected to embrace the whole of\nPlato’s philosophy. This curriculum principle, then, was\nsupposed to bring an author’s œuvre into\naccordance with itself, just as the skopos postulated organic\nunity in a single text. \nAll that was left at this point was to establish harmony between\ndifferent authors; and this is where sumphōnia or\n“agreement” comes into play. Building on Porphyry’s\nefforts (as opposed to Plotinus’ views), Iamblichus fully\nintegrated Aristotle into Platonism (see\n Section 5\n below); he also took into account Pythagoras and the\npseudo-Pythagorean corpus (see\n Section 4.3).\n References to other schools are scarce and mostly critical.\nIamblichus’ philosophical authorities, then, are Plato,\nAristotle, and the Pythagoreans; they were complemented by several\ntexts held to be divinely inspired, of which the two most important\nones are the Chaldean Oracles (a second-century collection of\nverse oracles which provide a Platonic-influenced revelation mostly\nbased on the Timaeus, and which develop a dualistic view\nabout matter and a divine energy called “fire”) and the\npseudo-Orphic Rhapsodies in 24 books. The Chaldean\nOracles at least are known to have been commented upon by\nIamblichus, in a huge commentary comprising at least 28 books\n(Damascius, De Principiis II, 1.5–8). (on\nIamblichus’ religious views, see below,\n Section 6.3.) \nIamblichus brought about a shift towards religion and theology in\nNeoplatonism which proved crucial for the later development of this\nmovement and for its Christian appropriation. The Reply to\nPorphyry, where Iamblichus rejects Porphyry’s\nover-confident intellectualism in theological and religious matters,\nis certainly our major source on debates in early Neoplatonism.\nScholars have traditionally described Iamblichus’ stance as\nirrational, contrasting it with Plotinus and Porphyry’s rational\nand philosophical approach (see Dodds 1951: 285–298). Recent\nscholarship, however, has effectively questioned this view (see\nTanaseanu-Döbler 2013). In his Reply to Porphyry (I, 2\n[SS-2013: 4.5–5.11]) Iamblichus distinguishes three disciplines,\neach with its own distinctive methods: philosophy, theology, and\ntheurgy. Theurgy certainly goes beyond reason and philosophy, but\nIamblichus’ appeal to theurgy and rituals is based on\nsophisticated philosophical views and arguments dealing with the\nnature of divine beings and the status of human souls (see below,\n Section 6).\n It would therefore be misleading to draw a strict opposition between\ntheurgy and rational methods. What is distinctive about Iamblichus\nvis-à-vis Plotinian Platonism is the thorough\nintegration of theological traditions into his account of reality.\nThis emerges in two related areas. Whether or not he wrote a work by\nthis title, Iamblichus is the first Neoplatonist to develop a\n“Platonic theology” (see Proclus, Platonic\nTheology III, 44.1–5 [Saffrey & Westerink\n1968–1997]). This approach will be carried further in Athenian\nNeoplatonism, especially by Proclus. Plotinus had already connected\nthe hypotheses about the One in the second part of Plato’s\nParmenides with his distinction of metaphysical principles\n(see Enn. V, 1.8). Iamblichus goes one step further in that he\nconnects the metaphysical reading of this dialogue with the gods of\nthe Greek pantheon. His interpretation of Plato’s\nParmenides can therefore be described not only as\n“metaphysical” but also as “theological”. In\naddition to this, Iamblichus provides a harmonising account of the\ndifferent theological traditions, again paving the way for the later\ndevelopments in Athenian Neoplatonism (see below,\n Section 3.2).\n In his Reply to Porphyry Iamblichus establishes a triad of\nfoundational traditions: the Egyptian, the Chaldaic and the Greek,\nrepresented by the philosophical wisdom of Pythagoras and Plato. The\nterm “Chaldaic” refers to the Chaldaean Oracles\n(see above,\n Section 2.2).\n The extant evidence suggests that Plotinus and Porphyry accorded\nlimited significance to the Oracles which, instead, become a\ncrucial source for Iamblichus: he wrote an extensive commentary on\nthis work and the revealed Platonizing theology of the\nOracles is an integral part of his thought. The Egyptian\ntradition is represented by the so-called Hermetic books and,\naccording to Iamblichus, this is the genuine source of Greek\nphilosophy (Reply to Porphyry I, 2 [SS-2013:\n4.7–9]). \nIamblichus’ philosophical stance is connected to some views\nwhich separate him from Plotinus and Porphyry and lay the ground for\nlater Neoplatonism, in particular that of Proclus and of the so-called\nAthenian school of the fifth and sixth century AD. These views\nconcern: the status of embodied souls (according to Iamblichus there\nis no superior part of our soul which resides in intelligible being);\nthe role of religious acts revealed by the gods to enable the\nsoul’s ascension to the intelligible realm (as already noted,\nfor Iamblichus, philosophical and intellectual contemplation alone are\nnot sufficient and theurgy is necessary); a harmonising account of the\nvarious theological traditions and the privileged role assigned to\nPythagoras and to the Chaldaean Oracles; an account of\nprinciples and of the metaphysical hierarchy which, while based on\nPlotinus’ and Porphyry’s doctrines, includes more degrees\nand intermediate levels; and, finally, a tendency towards\nscholasticism and the systematization of exegetical methods. \nA picture of Late Antique philosophy jumping from Iamblichus to\nProclus would however be misleading. Actually, more than one century\nseparates Iamblichus’ death from the foundation of the\nNeoplatonist school at Athens by Plutarch of Athens. Some crucial\ndetails escape us: for example, we don’t even know how and when\nIamblichus’ teaching entered the philosophical schools in Athens\n(Goulet 2012). In addition to this, Iamblichus’ posterity in the\nfourth century does not suggest that his philosophical approach was\nimmediately and unanimously followed. Praechter (1910) regarded those\ndisciples of Iamblichus’ who settled in Pergamon, gathering\naround Iamblichus’ student Aedesius, as forming a school (the\n“school of Pergamon”), where rational methods were\nabandoned in favor of theurgy and religious practices. In addition,\nthese philosophers are sometimes regarded as forming an ideologically\nengaged Pagan group threatened by Christian persecution after\nConstantine. Such views are somewhat oversimplistic. Our main source\nfor reconstructing this phase of Neoplatonism is Eunapius’\nLives of Philosophers and Sophists (Goulet 2014). As already\nnoted, Eunapius is a tendentious source, with his own hagiographical\nagenda and with little taste for philosophical technicalities.\nWhatever we make of this, he says that Iamblichus’ students\nformed a large crowd and that those who were eager to learn flocked to\nhim from all parts (see Eunapius Lives VI, 4 [Goulet 2014:\n12–14]). This and other passages suggest that Pagan\nphilosophical teaching definitely did not go underground under and\nafter Constantine (the elite of the Roman Empire was still largely\nPagan at that time). Eunapius’ list of Iamblichus’\nstudents confirms the echo of his teaching: the list includes Sopater\nthe Syrian (see above,\n Section 1.1),\n Aedesius, Eustathius from Cappadocia, Theodorus, and Euphrasius (see\nEunapius Lives V, 5 [Goulet 2014: 12.14–20]). Among\nthese, Theodorus is likely to coincide with Theodorus of Asine who,\nwhile being a student of Iamblichus, is said to have held different\nphilosophical views and reverted to an intellectualist Platonism of\nthe Plotinian sort. Aedesius’ school too certainly hosted\ndifferent positions and internal debates. So Eusebius of Myndus was a\nmember of that school, but apparently held an attitude closer to that\nof Plotinus and he was inclined to reject theurgical and magical\npractices. On the other hand, theurgy was adopted by Aedesius’\nIamblichean disciples such as Chrysanthius of Sardis, Maximus of\nEphesus, and Priscus of Thesprotia. Maximus and Priscus were\ncharismatic figures who are mainly known as masters and counsellors of\nthe Emperor Julian (Julian studied philosophy at Pergamon around 350).\nIamblichus’ teaching actually forms the philosophical background\nof Julian’s project of restoration of Paganism, as shown by\nJulian’s own writings and by the short treatise On the Gods\nand the Cosmos by one Salustius (possibly Saturninius Secundus\nSalutius, a dignitary at Julian’s court). It is worth noting,\nhowever, that even committed theurgists like Maximus did not abandon\nrational methods (we know about Maximus’ work on\nAristotle’s Categories and Prior Analytics). \nIn addition to internal debates among Iamblichus’ disciples,\nfourth-century philosophy includes an overtly anti-Iamblichean trend.\nThis is the case with Themistius (orator, commentator of Aristotle and\nauthoritative member of the Senate in Constantinople), who did not\nendorse Iamblichus’ philosophy and did not show any sympathy for\nhis theurgic and Pythagorean teaching. He actually sharply criticizes\nthe new philosophical approach represented by the “man of\nChalcis” (an allusion to Iamblichus: see Themistius,\nOr. 23, 295b). Themistius engaged in a controversy with\nMaximus of Ephesus over Aristotle’s logic in Constantinople,\nwhere Julian acted as arbiter (Ammonius, In Analytica Priora., p.\n31.11–23).\nFurthermore, Themistius regarded the Pythagorean Archytas’\ntreatise on the categories as spurious and argued that the author was\nnot a Pythagorean at all (Boethius, In Categorias, PL 64, 162 A).\nBy doing so Themistius actually removed the main support for\nIamblichus’ Pythagorean and metaphysical reading of Aristotle.\nIamblichus’ philosophy, then, was only gradually accepted and it\nwas regarded with both consensus and disagreement in its immediate\nposterity. Certainly, Iamblichus’ philosophical approach did not\nentail any abandonment of rational methods, not even among those who\nenthusiastically embraced theurgy. \nAs a general rule, Iamblichus’ system is best characterized as a\nrefined version of Plotinus’. Building on hierarchical hints\nalready present in the Enneads as well as the work of his own\nteacher Porphyry, Iamblichus set about producing a far more complex\npicture of reality, while keeping the same fundamental patterns in\nplace. \nIamblichus’ account of the One is difficult to ascertain, since\nthe crucial testimony (Damascius, De principiis II,\n1.4–16.19 Combès & Westerink) is somewhat oblique. What\nlies beyond doubt is that Iamblichus reacted against Porphyry’s\nintroduction of a first principle “coordinated” with the\nIntelligible Triad by positing two levels above it: on the one hand, a\n“wholly unspeakable principle”—which Theodorus of\nAsine and Damascius incorporated into their own theology, although\nProclus did not: on the subject, see Linguiti 1988—and, on the\nother hand, a principle “uncoordinated with the triad”. In\nthis respect, Iamblichus seems to have wished to distinguish between\ntwo almost contradictory aspects of the first principle: its\ntranscendence with respect to everything else (negative theology),\ni.e., absoluteness in a literal sense; and its causative aspect\n(cataphatic theology). Iamblichus, then, appears to have conceived of\nhis “unspeakable principle” as a safeguard against any\nobjection based on indefinite regress in the chain of causes, while\nthe principle that is “uncoordinated to the triad” is akin\nto Plotinus’ One, insofar as it lies above the Intellect. \nBelow the One is located the intelligible triad of Limit, the\nUnlimited, and the One-Being. This arrangement shows the influence of\nPlato’s Philebus 16C (with the uncoordinated One as the\nCause, and the One-Being as the mikton): this is accounted\nfor in Van Riel 2008. Damascius assimilates this sequence to another\none attributed to “the Pythagoreans”: Monad-Dyad-Triad,\nand, ultimately, to the system of principles inferred from the\nChaldean Oracles: Father-Power-Intellect. It is likely that\nthe same interpretation was already to be found in Iamblichus, given\nthat both Pythagoras and the Chaldeans rank high in his list of\nauthorities. \nWhether Iamblichus introduced the doctrine of “henads”\ninto the teachings of the Neoplatonic School remains controversial\n(see Mesyats 2012; Opsomer in Opsomer et al. 2018: 1365–1366). The henads\n(literally “unities”) are the very first plurality\nemanating from the One: since they are located beyond Being itself,\nthey are meant to bridge the gap between the absolute One and the\nintelligible world. Iamblichean authorship of this theory would make\nit predate Syrianus and Proclus—its first explicit\nproponents—by almost a century, and indeed several hints point\nin that direction, in particular the fact that, according to Proclus,\nIamblichus identified “God and the gods” as the subject of\nthe first hypothesis of Plato’s Parmenides. These\n“gods” might be self-sufficient items located right below\nthe One and, judging by the—admittedly very\nallusive—testimonies of Proclus (references in Saffrey &\nWesterink 1968–1997: III, pp. XVII–XXVI) and Damascius,\nmight indifferently be called “henads” or\n“intelligible gods”, in contradiction with Syrianus’\nand Proclus’ later terminological distinctions. \nThere is also another hint in support of this interpretation.\nDamascius explicitly states that according to Iamblichus divinity is\nclosely correlated to degrees of unity: the intelligible gods are\n“crystallised, as it were, around the One” (De\nprincipiis II, 36.17). According to this conception, the higher a\ngod is situated on the scale of reality, the more\n“unified” and undifferentiated it is, and the less\naccessible to the intellect and to conceptual knowledge: one can only\nknow such realities by resorting to intuition. This doctrine is hinted\nat in various passages of Iamblichus’ Reply to Porphyry\n(where unity, “friendship”—philia—and\ngoodness are all described as fundamental attributes of the gods:\n“whatever Being might be in them, this is equivalent to their\nunity”, I, 19 [SS-2013: 45.8–10]) and is also compatible\nwith his stressing the fact that knowledge of the gods is innate,\nlying as it does within the heart of every individual (I, 3 [SS-2013:\n5.14–20]). From an historical point of view, this gradual\ndiffusion of unity also represents a major contribution to the\nrepresentation of reality as a continuum, thereby somewhat bridging\nthe rift that, following Plotinus, had emerged between the One and the\nIntellect. “Unification” too (henōsis) also\nbecomes a key philosophical term, and this opens up the possibility of\nan anti-intellectual slant, as can be found in a famous extract of the\nReply to Porphyry (II, 11 [SS-2013: 73.1–16]). \nIamblichus’ best-known philosophical doctrine might be the\ndistinction he introduced between the “intelligible”\n(noēton) and the “intellective”\n(noeron). Before Iamblichus, noeron—not a very\ncommon word before the second century A.D.—was used to refer to\nany thinking entity, and Porphyry employs it mostly in association\nwith the soul. From Iamblichus onwards, it becomes a technical term\nwhich exclusively designates the order of gods located right below the\nIntelligible, and endowed with demiurgic functions. The word is found\nwith such a meaning in fourth-century authors in the tradition of\nIamblichus, such as the emperor Julian and Salustius. \nThe idea of distinguishing “seen” and “seeing”\nprinciples (objects and subjects of intellectual knowledge) dates back\nto the early interpretation of Plato’s Timaeus, where\nthe Demiurge appears to behold a Model located outside himself in\norder to gather from it all the data necessary for the creation of the\nCosmos: Middle Platonists thus used to distinguish between the\nDemiurge, Ideas, and Matter. As opposed to, e.g., Longinus (see Syrianus, In Metaphysica, 105.25–28),\nPlotinus had decisively argued that\nintelligibles are actually not to be found outside the Intellect.\nIamblichus instead falls back on more traditional positions and\nexpressly subordinates the Demiurge to the Intelligible Model. As, on\nthe other hand, Iamblichus follows Plotinus’ steps in developing\na doctrine of the One, this results in the Demiurge now being assigned\na secondary rank, as he is surpassed by a plethora of other deities,\nincluding the Intelligible Model (In Timaeum [D-1973: Fr.\n42–46]). He is but the third member of the\n“paternal” triad, itself part of a larger\n“intellective” Hebdomad (Proclus, In Timaeum I,\n308.17–309.13: compare this triad to Fr. 4 [D-1973] In\nPhilebum = Damascius, In Philebum § 105). From this\npoint onwards, until the closing of the Neoplatonic schools,\nidentifying the Demiurge with the First Principle is out of the\nquestion. \nOn the other hand, Iamblichus fully embraces Plotinus’ idea that\nintelligibles are endowed with life, power, activity etc. and\ntherefore multiplicity (at least implicitly). This allows him to\nsuperpose the divine names found in theology (Orpheus, the Chaldeans,\nand the dialogues of Plato dealing with the intelligible) upon a\nconceptual armature: for instance, the Platonic Demiurge is to be\nidentified with the Zeus of the Hellenic tradition. This effort\nreveals itself most conspicuously in Julian, and will find its\ncrowning in Proclus’ Platonic Theology. As a general\nrule, to every philosophical concept in the intelligible world there\ncorresponds some divine level or entity: the idea of such a\ncorrespondence and its application to the sequence of predicates\npresent in the hypotheses of Plato’s Parmenides is\ngenerally assigned to Proclus’ master Syrianus, but several\nhints suggest that it was actually introduced by Iamblichus. One\nexplicit instance of such a term-to-term correspondence is the\nlocalization of the genera of Being within the intellective order\nrather than the intelligible one, because of the former’s higher\ndegree of multiplicity (Proclus, Platonic Theology I,\n52.2–13). This important doctrine implies that the Demiurgic\nintellect is now conceived as some kind of “container” of\nall intelligible ideas, with the reservation that it is less unified\nthan the Model is. \nThrough a comparison between Julian and Proclus (see Lecerf 2012), one\nmay conclude that Iamblichus had conceived of a variety of Demiurges,\nthe main one (identified with Zeus) acting as a principle or\n“monad” for the others. While Zeus creates the world insofar as it is governed by rational laws and populated with beings\npertaining to species and genera (themselves of intelligible nature),\nother demiurgic entities are tasked with informing matter and bodies\n(which undergo a process of generation and corruption) according to\nsuch laws. \nIamblichus already uses the terminology “hypercosmic” vs.\n“encosmic” or “pericosmic” (e.g., Reply to\nPorphyry VIII, 8 [SS-2013: 200.25–27]), inherited from\nMiddle Platonism but destined to become technical in later\nNeoplatonism. In anticipation of this later use, they are meant to\nbridge the gap between the Demiurge and the sublunar realm, although\ntheir exact role remains unclear (the aforementioned passage speaks of\nthe help they give to souls in their ascent). Such lower entities seem\nto be produced according to a geometric progression (cf. In\nTimaeum [D-1973: Fr. 79]). The terminological continuity allows\none to conceive of Iamblichus’ system as the matrix for later\nvariations, particularly Proclus’ one, although it is to be\nnoted that no text bears witness to the presence of Proclus’\nintermediate “intelligible-intellective” and\n“hypercosmic-encosmic” levels in Iamblichus. \nThe hierarchies of “higher genera” will be considered in\n Section 6.1. \nIamblichus’ notion of Nature displays little originality when\ncompared to that of other Neoplatonists. It acts as a productive power\nfor cosmic beings, originating in the celestial gods (Reply to\nPorphyry III, 28 [SS-2013: 127.2–12]), but it does not act\naccording to reason. This ambiguity explains why, depending on the\ncontext, it can be considered either a positive entity, insofar as it\nis part of a reality governed by Providence, or a deceitful, almost\nevil force, a view strongly influenced by the Chaldean\nOracles (see, e.g., V, 18 [SS-2013: 166.18–24]): it comes as no surprise\nthat, in this respect, Nature is also closely associated with Fate.\nThe same ambivalence is to be found with regard to astrology, which\nIamblichus deems useful, yet not the best way to determine the\nidentity of our personal daimōn (IX, 4–5 [SS-2013:\n205.1–207.9]). \nMatter also displays both these traits—integration into the\nworld order and a connection with corporeality and evil.\nIamblichus’ Reply to Porphyry is replete with allusions\nto matter as a taint and source of corruption: “what is mixed\nwith the irrationality and darkness associated with bodies and matter\nis overcome with ignorance” (VI, 4 [SS-2013: 182.7–10]).\nBy contrast, “divine fire” strives to eradicate\nmateriality and generation (V, 12 [SS-2013: 161.2]). In such passages,\nIamblichus inherits the strongly negative views on matter developed by\nMiddle Platonists such as Numenius and further developed by Plotinus.\nHowever, a testimony from John Lydus (De Mensibus\n175.1–176.7 Wünsch) states, apropos Matter, that “nothing imperfect\nstems from the paternal (i.e., demiurgic) triad”. Thus the\npossibility of a monistic interpretation remains open: this evidence\nis studied by Taormina (2016). Accordingly, several testimonies (e.g.,\nSimplicius, In Categorias 418.3–8) also state that Iamblichus attributed no real existence\nto Evil, only a parhupostasis. \nIamblichus’ work exerted a very profound influence on the\nsubsequent course of Neoplatonic philosophy. In particular, he stands\nout as an important theologian owing to the shift he brought about\nwith respect to Plotinianism. With Iamblichus, Plotinus’\neconomical approach to metaphysical principles was developed into\nfull-fledged metaphysical laws: in this respect, Iamblichus emerges as\na remote forerunner of Medieval scholasticism. He himself vindicated a\n“scientific theology” (Reply to Porphyry I, 4\n[SS-2013: 10.18]) and established a canon of texts that gave it the\njustification of tradition.  \nPerhaps the most conspicuous trait of Iamblichean metaphysics is its\nhighly vertical conception of causality. For Iamblichus, an effect\ndoes not enjoy any ontological independence with respect to its cause:\nanything it adds amounts to failure and nothingness. This idea\npredates Iamblichus, but he was the first Pagan philosopher to apply\nit with absolute consistency. Most of his system follows from this one\naxiom, particularly his doctrine of the soul (see\n Section 6).\n The principles’ supervision always lurks in the background:\nsee, e.g., the idea that the intelligible gods “contain”\nthe visible gods (i.e., planets; Reply to Porphyry I, 19\n[SS-2013: 45.14–20]). The idea of the vacuity of effects leads\nto the notion that their sole purpose is to render themselves apt to\nreceive the influx of their causes: Iamblichus calls this\nepitēdeiotēs or “receptivity”. This\nprocess of adaptation accounts for most of the diversity in the\nphenomenal world. Another important law states that “everything\nis in everything according to its property”: Damascius ascribes\nit to both Iamblichus and Porphyry (In Philebum § 130 =\nIamblichus In Philebum [D-1973: Fr. 5]). The last words are the\nmost important: superior beings keep their prerogatives in spite of\nthe existence of a universal homology, which means for example that\ncauses are present to their effects as causes, i.e., are not\nencompassed by them or relegated to their status. In this way,\nIamblichus manages to preserve at the same time the benefits of divine\nimmanence (the world is not abandoned by the gods) and the requirement\nof divine transcendence, which he feels the need to constantly affirm,\nlest he be accused of debasing divinity. \nIamblichus’ programme of a scientific theology is based on newly\ndeveloped terminology, of which we have already seen several examples.\nIt also relies on new structures such as divine orders\n(diakosmoi, taxeis), a notion foreign to Plotinus.\nTheir proliferation does not bother Iamblichus in the least, since\ncentrifugal tendencies are curbed by constantly reasserting the\nfundamental unity of reality. This is provided for through the return\nof the same processes in a more or less absolute form (for instance,\nwhat exists in a unified manner in the universal Paradigm as a whole\nappears again in individual paradigms, yet only partially: see In\nTimaeum [D-1973: Fr. 43]). Recurring metaphysical laws serve the\nsame purpose, as do schemes such as the regrouping of divine entities\nin accordance with meaningful numbers, e.g., triads, a structure that\nadequately accounts for uni-multiplicity in reality since it treats as\none single process the succession of an immobile first state\n(monē), a dynamic procession (proodos) and a\nreturn or “conversion” to the first element\n(epistrophē; see In Timaeum [D-1973: Fr. 53]).\nTriads are thus a prime example of what modern commentators have named\nthe “law of mean-terms”, i.e., the need for a tertium\nquid to provide a mediation between two levels. Continuity is\nthereby introduced in the picture, although the latter remains\nresolutely holistic. The whole stands in relation to its parts as a\ncause to its effect: in this sense, it may be said that Iamblichus\ncreated and almost deified the Neoplatonic system as a unified and\ncoherent account of reality, avoiding any recourse to dualism. \nAs we have seen, Iamblichus posited at the top of his system, below\nthe One but above the Intelligible—and thus at a supra-essential\nlevel—the dual principles of Limit (peras) and the\nUnlimited (or Infinite: apeiron). These principles belong to\nthe Pythagorean tradition (see, e.g., Philolaus Fr. 1 Huffman and\nNicomachus, Introduction to Arithmetic II, 18, 4), although the main catalysts\nresponsible for their integration into the Neoplatonic system were two\nindirect accounts, Plato’s Philebus (see above,\n Section 3.1)\n and Aristotle, Metaphysics Α, 5 (987a15–19):\n \n(the Pythagoreans) thought that finitude and infinity were not\nattributes of certain other things, e.g., of fire or earth or anything\nelse of this kind, but that infinity itself and unity itself were the\nsubstance of the things of which they are predicated (trans. Ross).\n \nCloser to Iamblichus, one must also mention the precedent of Eudorus\nof Alexandria (apud Simplicius, In Phys.\n118.22–28), as well as Plotinus’ acknowledgment of\nsomething apeiron within the Intellect (Ennead II, 4\n[12]). \nThe importance of this Pythagoreanizing slant can hardly be\noverstated. In agreement with Iamblichus’ vertical conception of\nreality, it means that everything below this dyad is to be regarded as\na mix of determination and indetermination: and this includes gods, as\nwell as Forms such as those contained within the Model, some of which\nare claimed to partake in movement and alterity (see In\nTimaeum [D-1973: Fr. 46]), while less elaborate versions of\nPlatonism would rather view them as solely determinate, viz.\nthinkable. In a text from Simplicius’ commentary on the\nCategories (135.10–16 [DL-1972: Fr. 37]), the\nproductive capacity of the One appears to reflect these two\ndimensions:  \nSince the power of the One, from which all quantity is generated, is\nextended unchanged … and gives definition to each thing as it\nproceeds from itself, in that it pervades the whole in an entirely\nundivided manner, it brings the continuous into being, by making its\nprogression single and uninterrupted …: but in that it comes to\na halt in its progression at each of the forms and defines each\n… it brings about the discrete (trans. Fleet). \nConsequently, Iamblichus came to the conclusion that all things\npartake in opposition, a phenomenon most conspicuous in the sublunary\nworld, as the philosopher notes in the context of an allegorical\nexegesis of the prologue to Plato’s Timaeus (In\nTimaeum [D-1973: Fr. 10]). Thus, it appears that\nIamblichus’ goal in introducing the Limit–Unlimited pair\nwas to account for the genesis of multiplicity and alterity, Limit\nproviding definition and intelligibility, while the Unlimited enables\ninfinite flux and iteration within all individual items partaking of\nthe same form: this interpretation is, at any rate, in line with the\nepitēdeiotēs or “receptivity” axiom\n(see\n Section 3.5\n above), which states that the effect receives the causal influx\naccording to what it is itself, and thus always imperfectly. This may\nbe seen as Iamblichus’ equivalent of Plotinus’\nintellectual vitalism (the notion that the intelligible world is\nintrinsically active, being Life itself): it allows for considerable\nmetaphysical dynamism. To be sure, Limit retains axiological\nprecedence over the Unlimited, but indetermination can no longer be\nconceived of as a mere by-product of matter’s resistance to\nform. Rather, while it is true that higher principles are more\ncharacterized by Limit and lower ones by the Unlimited, each and every\nthing reflects, to some extent, both of these principles. \nLimit and the Unlimited are also principles active among mathematical\nentities (On General Mathematical Science, chap. 13). Here\nthey play a role similar to that of the pairs Monad and Dyad, Odd and\nEven, or Same and Other according to Nicomachus of Gerasa, the\nneo-Pythagorean author of the Introduction to Arithmetic and\none of Iamblichus’ intellectual heroes; similar pairs studied by\nthe mathematical sciences are “continuous” and\n“discrete” (sunekhes, diōrismenon),\n“magnitude” and “plurality”\n(megethos, plēthos: cf. Nicomachus,\nIntr. arith. I, 2, 4–5), all of which concur\nto form a dynamic picture of reality. The four mathematical\nsciences—arithmetic, which takes precedence over the others;\ngeometry, music and astronomy—each study a corresponding kind of\nbeing, and were the object of On Pythagoreanism vol. IV and\nVIII–X respectively (see the plan of the work as outlined by\nO’Meara 1989). \nIamblichus’ interest in mathematics is part of a larger trend\nthat includes authors such as Theon of Smyrna and Calcidius, but\nexcludes Plotinus and, to a lesser extent, Porphyry. For Iamblichus,\nmathematics is both a scientific discipline and concerns a realm of\nbeing, intermediate between the intelligible and the sensible: the\nlatter view is influenced by Aristotelian ontology as well as by the\nPlatonic analogy of the Line (Republic, 509d–511e), but\nwith the Pythagorean proviso that mathematical entities “exist\nin themselves” and that each number possesses a distinct\nessence. \nThe study of mathematics allows the soul to disengage itself from the\nmaterial world, thus providing a starting point towards higher being.\nMore interestingly, mathematics is assigned symbolic significance in a\nvariety of fields: vol. V–VII of On Pythagoreanism (now\nlost) dealt with the mathematical teachings that can be drawn\nconcerning ethics, physics and theology respectively (the anonymous\nTheologoumena arithmeticae might provide some insight into\nIamblichus’ view of the relation between arithmetic and\ntheology, as they include extensive quotes from Nicomachus as well as\nIamblichus’ first teacher Anatolius). Mathematics is therefore\nversatile and multivalent in its essence (see, e.g., On General\nMathematical Science, chap. 15; 18), and thus closely associated\nwith the soul (ibid., chap. 9). It is also very likely that\nSyrianus’ distinction of various types of\n“number”—in descending order: eidetic, mathematical,\nphysical, cf., e.g., In Metaphysica\n122.11–16—stems from Iamblichean teachings. \nIamblichus’ writings on mathematics were influential, and are\nused, e.g., in Syrianus’ commentary on the Metaphysics\nand Proclus’ commentary on Euclid. His views on the\nquadrivium, drawing upon Nicomachus, were also adopted by\nMartianus Capella and Boethius, and through them became an integral\npart of education in the Middle Ages. \nWhile Iamblichus took great pains to study mathematics in detail, its\ntrue meaning, according to him, is not of a “technical”\nnature: rather, it is meant to constitute a form of philosophical\nascesis: \nIf we intend to practice mathematics in a Pythagorean\nmanner, it is necessary to pursue with zeal its divinely inspired,\nelevating, purifying and perfective way. (On General\nMathematical Science, chap. 22) \nIndeed, as part of his sumphōnia programme, Iamblichus\nstrove to fully integrate Pythagorean teaching into the Hellenic\ndogmatic tradition, making Pythagoras the recipient of a divine\nrevelation handed down by Orpheus through the mysterious figure of\n“Aglaophamus” (De Vita Pythagorica 146). Book II\nof On Pythagoreanism, the Protrepticus, while using\na variety of sources, also taps into the Pythagorean repertoire with\nwisdom texts such as the Golden Verses. Building on the then\nwidely accepted axiom that the truth had already been revealed in\nremote times and then merely reformulated—if not\ntwisted—by recent writers, he accepted as authoritative the\npseudo-Pythagorean corpus for which he (along with Stobaeus, who knew\nthe Iamblichean œuvre quite well) is one of our main\nsources: on Iamblichus’ library of Pythagorean texts, see Macris\n2002. Iamblichus made the most conspicuous use of these texts in his\nlost Commentary on the Categories, where ps.-Archytas’\nOn the All was repeatedly quoted as the source of the\nAristotelian treatise (see below,\n Section 5.1). \nIn order to assess Iamblichus’ reliability as a witness of\nancient Pythagoreanism, one has to take into account a variety of\nfactors, including his attitude towards the information available to\nhim (ranging from literal dependence to creative elaboration for his\nown ideological and systematic purposes). This is crucial, since the\nPythagorean Life in particular is one of our major sources on\nthis subject (for details, see the studies collected in Huffman 2014;\nvon Albrecht et al. 2002). \nIamblichus wrote an extensive commentary on the Categories,\nfragments of which have been preserved by Simplicius and Dexippus (a\nstudent of Iamblichus): in addition to literal quotes, Iamblichus is\nbehind much of Simplicius’ extant exegesis of this treatise. We\nalso have evidence that Iamblichus wrote a commentary on\nAristotle’s Prior Analytics and we know about his\nexegetical work on the De interpretatione and the De\ncaelo (see Opsomer 2015). From the first century BC onwards,\nPlatonist philosophers had been familiar with Aristotle’s\nCategories: Platonists such as Eudorus of Alexandria and\nNicostratus raised objections against Aristotle’s doctrine;\nPlotinus wrote a very important treatise On the Genera of\nBeing, where he critically discussed Aristotle’s categories\n(Ennead VI, 1–3). To the best of our knowledge,\nhowever, no Platonist wrote a commentary on Aristotle’s\nCategories before Porphyry, who was the author of two\ncommentaries on this treatise: a short and extant elucidation in a\nquestion-and-answer format and a very extensive commentary in seven\nbooks dedicated to someone called Gedalius, which is now lost. In\naddition, Porphyry wrote an introduction to logic, the\nIsagoge, which is closely connected to the\nCategories. With Porphyry, then, Aristotle’s\nCategories became an integral part of the Platonist\ncurriculum and this was a crucial move for the subsequent history of\nLate Antique and medieval philosophy. As is often the case,\nIamblichus’ exegetical work relies on Porphyry but introduces\nsome changes which are probably aimed to supplement (and possibly\nsupplant) Porphyry’s approach. Simplicius informs us that\nIamblichus followed the great and now lost commentary written by\nPorphyry, while adding two distinctive features. First Iamblichus\n“applied his Intellective Theory (noera theōria)\neverywhere, to almost all of the chapter-headings” (Simplicius,\nIn Categorias, 2.13–15 [DL-1972: Fr. 2], trans. Chase; see\nDillon 1997). Iamblichus employs the same expression, noera\ntheōria in the opening section of the Reply to\nPorphyry (I, 2 [SS-2013: 4.16]), in a passage where he\ncharacterizes the mode of inquiry that is typical of theology.\nSecondly, Iamblichus took Archytas’ treatise On the All\nto be Aristotle’s source and he developed a thoroughly\nPythagorising interpretation of the Categories (Simplicius,\nIn Categorias, 2.15–25 [DL-1972: Fr. 2]; see Hoffmann 1980).\nArchytas’ treatise is actually a forgery which scholars now date\nto the first century BC. Iamblichus, however, took it to be a genuine\nwork by Archytas and in doing so he claimed a Pythagorean origin for\nAristotle’s theory. To sum up, Iamblichus’ exegesis of the\nCategories was an integral part of his Pythagorean\nphilosophical programme and in interpreting the Categories\nIamblichus made use of his metaphysical and theological views.\nApparently, Iamblichus pushed his reading of Aristotle along\nPlatonic/Pythagorean lines so far that (as later sources report) he\ndid not refrain from assuming that Aristotle was not opposed to Plato\non the theory of Ideas (see Elias/David, In Categorias,\n123.2–3). \nIamblichus’ interpretation characteristically included a\ndefinition of the “target” (skopos) of\nAristotle’s treatise, which Iamblichus regarded as focusing on\nsignifying expressions insofar as they signify things via concepts\n(see Hoffmann 1987). This view was not new and Simplicius traces it\nback to the previous tradition starting from the early Peripatetic\ncommentators (Simplicius, In Categorias, 13.15–18).\nIamblichus, however, added two distinctive features. First, he gave a\nmore systematic account of the target of Aristotle’s treatise\n(for example, Porphyry too claimed that Aristotle’s\nCategories focus on simple signifying expressions insofar as\nthey signify things, but to the best of our knowledge he did not refer\nto concepts). In addition to this, Iamblichus’ discussion of\nsemantics incorporated a Neoplatonist account of language and\nsignification grounded in Neoplatonic metaphysics and psychology\n(Simplicius, In Categorias, 12.16–13.12: see Griffin 2012).\nIamblichus referred to analogy (analogia) as a resource that\nexplains how Aristotle’s account of categories can be applied to\nintelligible beings too. For example, Simplicius reports that\naccording to Iamblichus the property of being receptive of contraries\nwhile being one and the same in number (see Arist., Cat., 5,\n4a10–11) applies to all levels of substance (both sensible and\nintelligible) via analogy (kata analogian, Simpl., In\nCategorias, 116.25–26 [DL-1972: Fr. 33]): in intelligible\nsubstance contraries belong to substance simultaneously whereas in\nsensible substance they exist successively. Accordingly, different\nlevels of being reveal corresponding structures (where lower degrees\nin the hierarchy entail increasing multiplicity and dispersion). This\nmetaphysical framework accounts for Iamblichus’ views about\ngenera and predication. Iamblichus is critical of the previous\nPeripatetic tradition: he criticizes Alexander of Aphrodisias for\nmistakenly regarding corporeal and incorporeal beings as species\nranked under the same genus (that of substance, ousia)\n(Simplicius, In Categorias, 83.20–23 [DL-1972: Fr. 24]).\nIamblichus’ point is that the Peripatetic reading of the\nCategories does not account for the hierarchical structure of\nreality. On Iamblichus’ view, full weight should instead be\ngiven to the hierarchical notion of the genus as a unity of derivation\nfrom a principle (actually the genus is both the principle itself and\nthe hierarchy of items depending on it). This structure does not\nentail that levels ranked in the same genus share any common item.\nRather, different and hierarchically ordered levels are connected via\nanalogy, so that lower items mirror higher ones while not sharing any\ncommon item with them. Analogy, then, allows Iamblichus to combine two\ncomplementary aspects of his metaphysics: on the one hand the vertical\nhierarchy that separates different levels of beings, on the other hand\nthe continuity that connects these different levels together within a\nunified whole. Iamblichus’ approach emerges in his account of\nessential or synonymous predication (the predication of items within\nthe same category). Porphyry argued that in this kind of predication\nsubject and predicate denote two different items, the\nakatakakton (uncoordinated or unallocated) and the\nkatatetagmenon (coordinated or allocated) (Simplicius, In\nCategorias, 53.6–9; 79.24–30). The meaning of these\nexpressions is debated. The “allocated genus” is to be\nidentified with the in re universal shared by particulars;\nthe unallocated may be either the separated and Platonic ante\nrem universal or the abstracted and post rem universal\nconcept. Whatever we make of Porphyry’s view, Iamblichus started\nfrom Porphyry’s exegesis and gave a different slant to it (see\nChiaradonna 2007). In doing so Iamblichus suggested that\nAristotle’s essential predication is a way of expressing the\nparticipation of corporeal beings in their transcendent genera\n(Simplicius, In Categorias, 53.9–18 [DL-1972: Fr. 16]). More\nprecisely, “Socrates is man” would be a way of expressing\nthe fact that the corporeal Socrates participates in the transcendent\nForm of Man. Separate genera provide the basis for essential\npredication, though they are not properly predicated in themselves\n(what is predicated is rather the participated item). Interestingly,\nIamblichus refers to the technical notion of ptōsis\n(“case”), which is associated with Aristotle’s\naccount of paronymy in the Categories: a ptōsis\nis an inflected form of a term (such as “grammatical” or\n“courageous”) which is paronymous with the noun form and\n\nderives from it (“grammatical” and\n\n“courageous” are both adjectival forms which derive from\n“grammar” and “courage” respectively). So\nIamblichus held that in the predicative statement “Socrates is\nman”, “man” improperly occurs in the predication\ninstead of its ptōsis: Iamblichus is probably referring\nhere to an adjectival construction like “human”. Such a\nparonymous form would correctly refer to the participation of Socrates\nin his transcendent Form. Simplicius informs us too that Iamblichus\nfocused on Aristotle’s account of motion and activity: Plotinus\nhad criticized Aristotle for not regarding motion as a single category\nand had argued that motion in sensible beings is a form of complete\nactivity (Simplicius, In Categorias, 303.35–306.12 [DL-1972:\nFr. 86]). Iamblichus rejects Plotinus’ account and aims to\nintegrate Aristotle’s account of sensible motion as\n“incomplete actuality” into a Platonist philosophical\nframework (see Taormina 1999: chap. III). \nIamblichus’ exegesis of the Categories (in particular\nhis account of genera of hierarchical structures and his use of\nanalogy) sheds light on other areas of his philosophy and forms the\nbackground of Iamblichus’ criticism of Porphyry’s account\nof divine hierarchy in the Reply to Porphyry (Chiaradonna\n2018). There Iamblichus rejects Porphyry’s account of divine\nhierarchy as misleading, since Porphyry regarded classes of divine\nbeings as species ranked under the same genus and determined by\n“properties” (idiōmata) that act as specific\ndifferentiae (Reply to Porphyry, I, 4 [SS-2013:\n7.21–8.6]). In so doing, Porphyry ruins the very idea of\nhierarchy: divine comes to be a common genus which is\npredicated of all of its species, in the same way as animal\nis predicated of (say) horse and dog. Against\nPorphyry, Iamblichus calls for a qualified use of logical notions\nwhich makes the hierarchical relation between different classes of\ndivine beings clear. Each level differs from the others as a whole and\nnot in the same way as different species are divided under the same\ncommon genus. As said above, in his interpretation of the\nCategories Iamblichus argued that the genus is a hierarchical\nrelation in which items from different levels are analogically\nconnected to their origin. This can be set in parallel with what\nIamblichus says in the Reply to Porphyry:  \nBut if one were to apply an analogical principle of identity to\ndifferent genera, for example to the many genera of gods, and again to\nthose among the demons and heroes, and lastly in the case of souls,\nthen one might succeed in defining their specific characteristics.\n(Reply to Porphyry, I, 4 [SS-2013: 10.25–11.4], trans.\nCDH-2003) \nAccording to Iamblichus, “soul” is but the last and\nweakest link in the chain of “higher genera”\n(kreittona genē). In the Reply to Porphyry,\nthose entities are enumerated in full:\ngods—archangels—angels—demons—heroes—archons\nruling the world—enmattered archons—souls. This is a token\nof Iamblichus’ receptiveness towards the religious speculation\nof his day, although most of this theological bestiary was in fact\nalready present in Porphyry’s Letter to Anebo.\nIamblichus’ acceptance of “evil demons” (cf.\nO’Neill 2018) is particularly interesting, since it seems to\nundermine Iamblichus’ monism and providentialism, and is best\nexplained as reflecting the influence of the Chaldean\nOracles. \nIn contradistinction with the gods, the soul receives a plethora of\nnegative traits: it is imperfect, intermittent, it leans towards\nmatter; and while the causes of Order and Beauty exist in full\ncommunion with the gods, the soul can never be given more than a mere\nshare of it (Reply to Porphyry I, 6–7 [SS-2013:\n15.14–17.7]). The immutability of this celestial hierarchy is\nstriking, and foreshadows the later works of Hierocles, Proclus, and\npseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. Although the soul’s\nversatility—its ability to “make use of varied forms and\nlife-principles”—allows it to attach itself to superior\nbeings and lay claim “to receiving perfection as an angelic,\nimmaculate soul” (Reply to Porphyry II, 2 [SS-2013:\n51.10–52.11]), on closer reading it appears to be unable to\nescape its condition by virtue of its own essence: its ascent is never\ncomplete (it is an endeavor, ephesis or\nhenōsis, with a suffix expressing verbal action) and it\npresupposes, moreover, the gods’ “goodwill and\nillumination”. Porphyry had previously drawn a similar\ndistinction between demons that are so “by essence”\n(kat’ ousian) or by mere “relation”\n(kata skhesin), the latter being those humans who, by virtue\nof their excellent life, are allotted demonic status. On the other\nhand, the human soul is also unable to be relegated to the rank of\nanimals via metempsychosis (cf. the title of one of Iamblichus’\npsychological works preserved by Nemesius of Emesa, On the Nature\nof Man, chap. 2, p. 35.7–11 Morani). Some points, however,\nremain unclear, such as how exactly Iamblichus’ generic\ndistinction between human souls and “divine” ones would\nfit within such a structure; or what we are to make of the souls of\nexceptional, even semi-divine characters such as Pythagoras or the\ntheurgists. Similar preoccupations underlie Frs. 82 and 83 In\nTimaeum [D-1973], interpreting Timaeus 41d. \nLastly and perhaps most importantly, the soul is irremediably inferior\nto the intellect. Rejecting any internalist interpretation of\nintellectual processes, Iamblichus regards them as the result of the\nsoul’s illumination by a transcendent entity. Our information on\nthis matter is to be gathered mostly from the late Aristotelian\ncommentators, pseudo-Simplicius (see In De anima\n313.1–10, with a reference to the “unparticipated”\nintellect which, if genuinely Iamblichean, would predate Proclean\nterminology) and Priscian of Lydia (Metaphrasis in\nTheophrastum): these relatively neglected texts are the object of\nthe pioneering work Steel 1978. Indeed, such a position implies some\nknowledge of the philosophical debates on this issue within the\nAristotelian tradition (Theophrastus, Alexander). Its significance is\nenormous, insofar as it directly leads to the rejection of\nPlotinus’ doctrine of the undescended soul: that is, the idea\nthat something of the soul always remains in the intelligible world.\nThus, rejecting the notion that the soul shares homeomereia\nwith the remaining intellectual entities, Iamblichus writes:  \nthe doctrine opposed to this separates soul, insofar as it is born\nsecond with regard to the intellect as a distinct hypostasis, and\ninterprets what, in it, partakes of intellect as something dependent\nfrom intellect, although it is susceptible of individual existence;\nand it separates it from all the higher genera. (De anima,\nsect. 7 [DF-2002])  \nIamblichus also fiercely attacks Plotinus (as well as Theodorus of\nAsine) for the assumption that “there is something in us that is\nimpassible and always thinking” (In Timaeum [D-1973:\nFr. 87]; on this text see Rist 1975 and Dillon 2005). However, here\nagain the attitude of the superior souls with regard to their descent\nis somewhat obscure: according to Damascius (In Parm. IV,\n24.1–7 Combès & Westerink), Iamblichus taught that the\nfirst class of souls “descends while not descending”, and\nthat the descent “only effects a presence alongside what is\nhere”. This problem was tackled by van den Berg (1997; opting\nfor the existence of unaffected pure souls and thus positing\nIamblichus as an intermediary between Plotinus and Proclus) and\nTaormina (2012; emphasizing that every soul remains separated from the\nintelligible and only relates to it through participation). It is, in\nany case, clear that Iamblichus conceived of the soul’s presence\nin this world as something natural and normal, not as a transitory\nexile, even less as “always an evil” (the theory of\nCronius, Numenius and Harpocration, criticized in De anima\nsect. 29 [DF-2002]). \nIt is fair to say that Iamblichus—in this respect closer to\nPorphyry—focuses more closely than Plotinus on the soul’s\nindwelling within the body and on the actions it performs alongside\nit. In what remains of his treatise On the Soul, he reviews\nall sorts of historical theses about the composition, powers and\nactivities of the soul, and does not hesitate to engage his\nNeoplatonic predecessors. \nIn the available testimonies (Priscian in particular: see the\nassessment in Huby 1993), the soul is constantly associated with the\nnotion of “life”. The latter is approached here not so\nmuch as an essential psychic property (as had been the case in the\nPhaedo), as in terms of the corporeal\n“life-principles” (zōai, most often in the\nplural) that the soul is said to project outside of itself in order to\nget a hold on the external world:  \ninsofar as it puts forth other levels of life that incline towards generation and consort with the body, thus far (soul) is involved in the order of the\ncosmos (Letter to Macedonius, apud Stobaeus,\nAnthology II, 8, 45 [DP-2009: 25]).  \n\nIn this manner, psychic\nactivities that involve a relationship with external objects (such as\nsense-perception) presuppose a dialectic relationship between the\nsoul’s essence and the multiplicity of powers it deploys: the\nindividual and immaterial entity “soul” goes out of itself\nto grasp enmattered items, before going back (literally\n“converting”, epistrephein) in order to compare\nthe data thus aggregated to (stable) Forms, which lend it\nintelligibility. As a result,  \nthe particular soul, as being in the middle of all the kinds of things\nof this world, and being divided together with them and being\nmultiplied along with them, not only remains but also changes, living\nthrough so many partial lives. And not only with regard to its\ndispositions, but also with regard to its substance it changes\nsomewhat. (Priscian, Metaphrasis 32.15–19 [trans. Huby\n1993: 8])  \nThe imagination, being torn between sensibility and abstract\nintellection, whose difference it helps bridge, functions in a similar\nway and contributes to making the soul the median entity par\nexcellence. \nSensibility, then, would seem to be proof of the soul’s radical\ninability to remain in itself, as opposed to the intellect, which is\nimmobile and in actuality by its own nature (another sign of the fact\nthat the unity of the soul is no longer considered self-evident is the\nintroduction of the so-called “vehicle” of the soul, a\nspiritual garment that acts as an interface between the soul and\nbodies: on this subject, cf. Finamore 1985). What stands out as most\nremarkable is the notion that the soul’s essence is also\nchallenged in the course of sensitive acts. Iamblichus here inherits\nthe Aristotelian terminology of Essence/Substance\n(ousia)—Power (dynamis)—Activity\n(energeia): a single essence—say, the human\nsoul—acts as a substratum for a plurality of powers (sensitive,\nintellective, imaginative, etc.), and those powers are in turn\nactualized in a greater plurality of activities (sense-perception,\naisthēsis, of x, y, or z;\nintellection, noēsis, about x, y, or\nz). These three terms are hierarchised, insofar as the soul can\nremain inactive: but in Aristotle, this hierarchy remains largely\nimplicit, contrary to Iamblichus and his unequivocal conception of\nvertical causality (see above,\n Section 3.5).\n In applying his own principles, Iamblichus argues that, since the\neffect is nothing outside of its cause, any flaw connatural to the\neffect would also have to be preassumed in the cause. Since, then, the\nsoul’s activities show instability and imperfection,\nthis inability to act consistently and permanently points to a break\nin its very essence (cf. De anima sect. C [DF-2002] =\npseudo-Simplicius, In De anima 89.33–35). \nThis is Iamblichus’ notion of the “changing self”,\nas first expounded by Steel 1978. Such a conception of the human soul\nrepresents a major break in the Platonic tradition, which until then\nhad been prone to emphasize the soul’s inner dignity and\ndivinity: on the other hand, it is a very convenient way to account\nfor human fallibility. One could interpret it as a literal exegesis of\nTimaeus 35a: the Demiurge creates the soul’s essence as\na mix of indivisible and divisible Being, so that—one might\nthink—it is no more indivisible than it is divisible. By the\nsame reasoning, Iamblichus concludes that the soul is at the same time\nchanging and unchanging, dying and undying. This, at least, is what\ncharacterizes “particular” souls (merikai or\nen merei: a terminology propagated by Iamblichus—see\nReply to Porphyry V, 2 [SS-2013: 149.26]—before it\nbecame usual in later authors). The case of divine souls is less\nclear-cut, since they are able to mend the gap between essence and\nactivity (De anima sect. 20–21; see also 18). It is\nunclear whether—and how—this picture can be reconciled\nwith Iamblichus’ allusions to “two souls”, one\noriginating in the intelligible, the other given to us by celestial\ninfluences (Reply to Porphyry VIII, 6 [SS-2013:\n199.1–12]). \nBelittled as it is in the grand scheme of things, and unable to\nachieve any perpetual union with the intelligible world, the human\nsoul is deemed connatural to “nothingness” (Reply to\nPorphyry III, 18 [SS-2013: 108.16–17]). It now needs\nexternal help from the gods—that is, grace—in\norder to perform any relevant action. Broken in its essence,\nit is, however, able to regain some ground through its\nactivity. Co-action with the gods, “godlike\naction” (theourgia, i.e., theurgy), is the purpose of\nthe Iamblichean soul, which it attains through religious acts such as\nprayer, offerings, sacrifice, etc., that is the very liturgy that\nPorphyry had attacked in the Letter to Anebo. Hence the\nnecessary connection between two fields, psychology and the philosophy\nof religion, which was clearly set out by Shaw (1995). Ritual is given\nprecedence over philosophical ascesis or discursive thinking, although\nIamblichus would say that he is merely giving philosophy its due place\nrather than abolishing it: it is also true that he underlines the need\nfor the religious practitioner to be virtuous, individual sanctity\nbeing a requisite to make the medium apt to receive the gods’\ninflux. But Iamblichus heavily stresses that the key to the whole\nprocess always lies in the gods: very interestingly,\n“human”, “artificial” or “natural”\ncontributions are equally side-lined and relegated to the status of\nmere auxiliary causes (see, e.g., Reply to Porphyry III, 9\n[SS-2013: 89.7–9]). He is also adamant about the human inability\nto extort any effect from the higher beings (i.e., via\n“magic”), since they are by nature impassible. \nIt remains beyond doubt that his stance on the matter is\nanti-intellectualist in nature and thus in stark contrast with the\nteachings of Plotinus and Porphyry. One does not start with\nself-knowledge, as Porphyry had set out to demonstrate in a treatise\nOn the phrase: “Know thyself”, which he had\ndedicated to Iamblichus, no doubt cognizant of all the implications of\nthis (Fr. 273 Smith = Stobaeus, Anthology III, 21, 26). Instead,\nknowledge of the gods encompasses self-knowledge (Reply to\nPorphyry X, 1 [SS-2013: 212.2–3]) and should be taken as\nthe correct starting-point. What remains intellectualistic in\nIamblichus’ approach is the conviction that not acting in the\nlight of theological knowledge leads to the failure of the ritual\nprocess (ibid. II, 10 [SS-2013: 68.25–69.20]).\nAccordingly, the best theurgist is also the best theologian: and since\nIamblichus’ theology is highly philosophical in nature, insofar\nas it strives to identify the Pagan gods with metaphysical forces or\nconcepts and submits them to the authority of the Platonic One, it\nseems necessary that, in Iamblichus’ system, precedence be given\nto Neoplatonist religious specialists deriving their information from\nthe appropriate literature. In this respect, theurgy represents a\nrationalization of the irrational, rather than the converse. It is\nalso important to note that the conflict between the\nPlotino-Porphyrian approach and Iamblichus’ one does not simply\namount to a conflict between philosophy and religion; rather, it\nopposes two different modes of access to the divine, with\nIamblichus’ predecessors laying emphasis on silent ascesis and\nthe shedding of our external identity, and accordingly viewing\ncorporeality and materiality as something inherently negative. \nAccording to Iamblichus, the gods help mankind overcome its inherent\nweakness by revealing symbols to them that will establish some sort of\nconnection: one of the criticisms he lays on Porphyry is that his\nviews will “leave earth deprived of the presence of the superior\nbeings” (Reply to Porphyry I, 8 [SS-2013:\n21.12–13]). These symbols may differ in nature: items, rituals,\nmyths, theological revelations such as the Chaldean Oracles,\netc.; and most of them are placed under the patronage of a particular\ndeity, thus creating a “chain” (seira) of, say,\nsun-like entities. In this manner, Iamblichean ontology necessarily\nleads to cultural traditionalism; it also opens up the possibility of\na grandiose sumphōnia of all Pagan schools or currents,\nbe they Hellenic or “barbarian”, the latter actually being\nassigned even more prestige insofar as the Egyptians, Assyrians,\nPhoenicians etc. enjoy greater antiquity\nand—supposedly—avoided innovation, contrary to the Greeks\n(Reply to Porphyry VII, 5 [SS-2013: 192.22–24]). A\nwhole new field thus opened up for Platonists in which they could\nexercise their exegetical virtuosity in search of remarkable\nanalogies. It is no wonder, then, that Iamblichus’ views were\nheartily embraced by later proponents of a “Pagan\nrevival”, of whom the most prominent was Julian the Apostate: a\nRoman emperor as well as the pupil of Maximus of Ephesus, who was a\nphilosopher in the tradition of Iamblichus in addition to being the\nmost infamous theurgist of his time. \nNeoplatonism has often been regarded as a theological and\nother-worldly philosophy which assigns little (if any) significance to\npolitics and conceives of ethics merely as an ascetic path for the\nseparation of the soul from the body. This view has recently been\nquestioned by D.J. O’Meara and the significance of Neoplatonist\npolitical philosophy is gaining increasing attention (see\nO’Meara 2003; Schramm 2013). Iamblichus wrote a whole treatise\nOn virtues, which is lost but whose content can be inferred\nfrom later sources. In addition to this, references to ethics and\npolitics can be gathered from his extant works, especially the letters\npreserved by Johannes Stobaeus (see DP-2009; TP-2010). It is a notable\nfact that some of Iamblichus’ interlocutors were influential\nfigures in the fourth-century Roman empire, as is for example the case\nwith Sopater of Apamea (see above,\n Section 1.1).\n It is somewhat difficult to clearly grasp Iamblichus’ position\non these issues, since his treatise on virtues is lost, the later\ntestimonia are cursory and Iamblichus’ letters are for the most\npart introductory and refrain from philosophical technicalities. \nThe extant evidence nonetheless suffices to outline some of\nIamblichus’ views. Two letters focus on providence, fate and\nfree will against the background of Iamblichus’ account of\ncausation, which sees the One as the principle of all being and the\nlower levels of reality as characterized by increasing degrees of\nmultiplicity (see the letters to Macedonius and Sopater: Johannes\nStobaeus I, 5, 17 and I, 5, 18). Iamblichus identifies the sphere of\noperation of fate with nature, i.e., “the immanent causal\nprinciple of the cosmos and that which immanently comprises the\ntotality of causes of the realm of generation” (DP-2009: 35). These views are reminiscent\nof the Stoic deterministic model of causation, but Iamblichus also\nemphasises that the soul contains within itself a free and independent\nlife and is able to emancipate itself from worldly influences (see\nJohannes Stobaeus I, 8, 45a). \nThis theological and metaphysical framework also grounds\nIamblichus’ views about politics. In his letters he describes\nthe art of rulership as a kind of divinisation based on wisdom:\nthrough wisdom human beings are assimilated to gods and political\nrulership is an image of divine rulership in cosmos (see Johannes\nStobaeus III, 3, 26). Leadership is connected with philanthropy, which\nmakes the ruler mild, pleasant and approachable. Such views outline a\ncharacteristically theocratic view. Elsewhere, however, Iamblichus\nsuggests a more modest view about rulership: he emphasises the\nimportance of law, which he sees as the genuine expression of a divine\nmodel, the ruler being only its guardian (see Johannes Stobaeus IV, 5,\n77). Such views can certainly be traced back to Plato: the passages\nabout kingship can be set in parallel with Plato’s account of\nphilosopher-kings in the Republic, whereas those about the\nprimacy of laws obviously recall Plato’s political views in the\nLaws. But parallels are abundant even outside the Platonist\ntradition (e.g., in Stoicism and in Dio Chrysostomus, in the\nPseudo-Pythagorean writings) and the introductory tone of\nIamblichus’ letters makes it difficult to isolate characteristic\nNeoplatonist elements. According to some interpreters, however,\nIamblichus’ interest in politics is likely to be connected to\nhis views about the embodied soul. As O’Meara remarks,  \nHuman soul, alienated from its divine origins, finds its identity in\nits relation to body. As a consequence, the material, bodily aspects\nof the human condition were to be of much greater relevance for the\ndivinization of soul in later Neoplatonism than in Plotinus. (2003:\n39)  \nIn fact, Neoplatonist philosophical ideas shaped not only\nIamblichus’ views about politics, but also those of the Emperor\nJulian, whose Neoplatonist background (ultimately deriving from the\nIamblichean teaching of his masters at Pergamon) informs both his\naccount of law and rulership (see Julian’s Letter to\nThemistius) and his theological foundation of the Roman Empire\n(Elm 2012). \nIn Ennead I, 2, Plotinus holds that virtues bearing the same\nnames (that is the four cardinal virtues of Plato’s\nRepublic: wisdom, temperance, courage and justice) exist in\ndifferent grades at different levels: the lower level is that of the\nso-called civic or political virtues, whereas the higher degrees\ninclude the soul’s purification and the result of it, that is\nthe contemplation of Intellect on the part of the soul. In\nSentence 32, Porphyry draws on Plotinus and offers a\nclassification of virtues: these are divided into civic, purificatory,\ncontemplative and paradigmatic virtues. Iamblichus’ lost\ntreatise On virtues was certainly based on these previous\ndiscussions and offered a systematic discussion that laid the ground\nfor later Neoplatonist accounts of the so-called scala\nvirtutum. The late anonymous Prolegomena to Plato’s\nphilosophy ascribes the distinction of five levels of virtues to\nIamblichus: natural, moral, political, purificatory, and contemplative\n(see Prolegomena § 26.30–36). This distinction is\nconnected to the order or reading of Plato’s dialogues: so the\nGorgias focuses on the political virtues, the Phaedo\non the purificatory. All this is most likely to derive from\nIamblichus, who then associated his canon of twelve Platonic dialogues\nwith the different levels of the scala virtutum (see above,\n Section 2.2).\n While crucial, the testimony of the Prolegomena is\nnonetheless partial: we know from Damascius and Marinus of Neapolis\nthat Iamblichus’ distinction had two further levels at the top:\nthose of “paradigmatic” and “theurgic” or “hieratic” virtues. Iamblichus,\ntherefore, probably distinguished seven levels of virtues: natural,\nmoral, political, purificatory, contemplative, paradigmatic, theurgic\nor hieratic. The views about the soul and theurgy outlined above help\nexplain why Iamblichus, unlike Plotinus and Porphyry, posited theurgic\nor hieratic virtues at the top of his classification: such virtues are\nthe highest degree of the soul’s ascension to the divine, which\nhuman beings cannot achieve merely through their intellect. \nIt is worth noting that the author of the Prolegomena sets\nout the hierarchy of virtues as an order “according to\ndepth” (kata bathos). The term bathos has a\ntechnical meaning in Iamblichus: it is borrowed from mathematics and\nis opposed to platos insofar as it describes the vertical\norder of items in a hierarchy, as opposed to the horizontal one (see\nTaormina in TP-2010: 245). This suggests that Iamblichus arranged his\nclassification of virtues according to the vertical pattern described\nabove, which points to his distinctive account of the hierarchy of\nbeings.","contact.mail":"riccardo.chiaradonna@uniroma3.it","contact.domain":"uniroma3.it"},{"date.published":"2019-08-27","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/iamblichus/","author1":"Riccardo Chiaradonna","author2":"Adrien Lecerf","entry":"iamblichus","body.text":"\n\n\nIamblichus (ca. 242–ca. 325) was a Syrian Neoplatonist and\ndisciple of Porphyry of Tyre, the editor of Plotinus’ works. One\nof the three major representatives of early Neoplatonism (the third\none being Plotinus himself), he exerted considerable influence among\nlater philosophers belonging to the same tradition, such as Proclus,\nDamascius, and Simplicius. His work as a Pagan theologian and exegete\nearned him high praise and made a decisive contribution to the\ntransformation of Plotinian metaphysics into the full-fledged system\nof the fifth-century school of Athens, at that time the major school\nof philosophy, along with the one in Alexandria. His harsh critique of\nPlotinus’ philosophical tenets is linked to his pessimistic\noutlook on the condition of the human soul, as well as to his advocacy\nof salvation by ritual means, known as “theurgy”.\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle is known about Iamblichus’ life and career, since\nEunapius of Sardis’ biography of Iamblichus (Lives of\nPhilosophers and Sophists V [Goulet 2014]) is merely\nhagiographical in nature. His birthplace is traditionally taken to be\nChalcis ad Belum (modern Qinnasrin), although support has recently\nbeen voiced in favor of a different Chalcis, Chalcis sub Libanum\n(Aliquot 2010: 307 and n. 7). What is uncontroversial is that\nIamblichus hailed from a very influential Syrian family, the\nSampsigeramids of Emesa (Damascius, Philosophical History,\nAthanassiadi 1999: 334.10–14 [Zintzen 1967: 2.8–10]), who had gained\naccess to the Imperial throne along with Elagabalus\n(218–222). \nEunapius gives Anatolius and then Porphyry as Iamblichus’ two\nteachers, and there are no decisive reasons to doubt this: on the one\nhand, it is evident that he was influenced by the kind of theological\narithmology Anatolius championed; on the other hand, Porphyry\ndedicated his treatise On the “Know thyself” to\nIamblichus (Stobaeus, Anthology III, 21, 26) and provides\ninformation about the philosopher’s son (Life of\nPlotinus 9). Since this son is said by Porphyry to have married a\nRoman aristocrat, it is very likely that Iamblichus studied in Rome\nunder Porphyry, who would have carried on the philosophical circle\nPlotinus had founded in 244. Dalsgaard Larsen’s (DL-1972: I,\n38–39) supposition of a prolonged stay at Alexandria is dubious\nat best. \nAfter a break with Porphyry that seems impossible to date with\nprecision, Iamblichus settled in Syria. Although he is known to have\nowned an estate in Antioch’s suburb of Daphne, it is now\naccepted that he settled in Apamea, where Plotinus’ first\ndisciple Amelius had previously moved. There, welcomed by a wealthy\nnotable, Sopater, he founded a flourishing school: we know about a\ndozen of his students (see below,\n Section 2.4),\n among whom the most conspicuous are Sopater himself, who died\nbecause of a plot at Constantine’s court; Aedesius, who moved\nthe school to Pergamon; and Dexippus, the only disciple of whom we\nstill have a philosophical work (a commentary on Aristotle’s\nCategories). Apart from Eunapius, evidence about\nIamblichus’ whereabouts in Apamea is to be found mainly in\nLibanius (e.g. Ep. 1389.13–14) and, above all, in the\nletters by an anonymous Syrian sophist\nwhose correspondence with Iamblichus was\npreserved among the genuine letters of the emperor Julian (e.g. Pseudo-Julian, Ep. 78 and 79 Wright). \nFew of Iamblichus’ works are preserved in the direct manuscript\ntradition. Four of these texts pertain to a summa On\nPythagoreanism (conflicting testimonies exist about its title:\ncf. O’Meara 1989: 32–33): On the Pythagorean\nLife; the Protrepticus; On General Mathematical\nScience; and an Introduction to Arithmetic based on\nNicomachus of Gerasa’s treatise of the same name. Sadly, they\nare for the most part impersonal works: the Protrepticus\nconsists in lengthy quotations from previous hortatory literature, and\nits interest mostly lies in the fact that it provides evidence for\nvaluable lost works (most notably Aristotle’s own\nProtrepticus and the so-called Anonymus Iamblichi),\nwhile On the Pythagorean Life plagiarizes previous\nbiographies of the master, although it certainly contains valuable\ninsights on Iamblichus’ conception of the “divine\nman”. Neither of these works seems to have had any impact over\nthe subsequent course of philosophy, whereas On General\nMathematical Science was at least a formative influence on\nProclus’ commentary to Euclid’s Elements, as well\nas on Syrianus’ commentary on Metaphysics\nΜ–Ν. It also\nprovides the basic material for the reconstruction of\nIamblichus’ philosophy of mathematics (see below,\n Section 4).\n For a general characterization of On Pythagoreanism and its\ncontext, see Huffman (2006 [2019: sect. 4.4]). \nThe most important extant treatise by Iamblichus, however, is the\nReply of Master Abamon to Porphyry’s Letter to Anebo, and\nSolutions to the Difficulties Contained Therein (abbreviated to\nReply to Porphyry and traditionally known as De mysteriis\nÆgyptiorum since Marsilio Ficino’s original Latin\ntranslation: see SS-2013: ix–xxi). The work is a defense of\nPagan religious practice (sacrifice, prayer, divination etc.) against\nthe objections raised by Porphyry, and to serve this purpose it\nintroduces several philosophical developments on the divine nature and\norders, as well as the pretensions of the human soul. The whole debate\nis framed with a fictional Egyptian scenario: Porphyry had raised his\nobjections in an epistle addressed to Anebo, an Egyptian priest, while\nIamblichus wrote his reply under the assumed guise of the Egyptian\nprophet Abamon. While it had limited direct transmission (the only\nancient testimonium being Proclus, In Timaeum I,\n386.8–13 [D-1973: Fr. 38], although Taormina (2014) expressed\nreservations), its importance as a touchstone against which one can\nsafely compare what can be gathered from other sources is\ninvaluable. \nThe bulk of what remains of Iamblichus’ work consists in approx.\n800 fragments and testimonia. Of these, the extensive excerpts given\nby Stobaeus of a work On the Soul as well as a dozen\nLetters, which have been the object of multiple independent\neditions, stand out as the most coherent, if not necessarily the most\noriginal. By far the most influential part of his philosophical\noutput, his Commentaries on key works by Plato and Aristotle\nare all lost, although in almost two cases (his commentary on the\nCategories, transmitted by Simplicius; that on the\nTimaeus, transmitted by Proclus), quotations are so numerous\nthat one can safely establish the main features of the exegesis given.\nOf the other works Iamblichus wrote commentaries on, the most\nimportant ones are the Alcibiades, the Philebus and\nthe Parmenides, while the existence of a separate, continuous\ncommentary on Aristotle’s De anima was questioned by\nBlumenthal (1974). A richly annotated edition of the Platonic\nfragments was given by D-1973, while DL-1972 collected all fragments\nknown to Dalsgaard Larsen as an appendix to his monograph, although\nhis work can barely be described as an edition. Another collection\nfocusing on Aristotelian exegesis was recently produced by Romano\n[R-2012]. \nIamblichus’ significance in Late Antique philosophy can hardly\nbe overestimated. Karl Praechter described him as the second founder\nof Neoplatonism after Plotinus and argued that Iamblichus’\nposition was similar to that of Chrysippus in ancient Stoicism\n(Praechter 1910: 143). This statement aptly expresses\nIamblichus’ historical and philosophical significance, but needs\nmuch qualification: unlike the Stoa, “Neoplatonism” is not\nan ancient philosophical school, but a modern historical category\n(whose reliability scholars are sometimes inclined to question: see\nCatana 2013). Iamblichus is likely, as was mentioned above\n (Section 1.1)\n to have been a student of Porphyry who was, in turn, a student of\nPlotinus. Iamblichus’ school was, however, completely separate\nfrom that of Plotinus, both in time and in place: consequently,\ndespite late, ideological attempts to reconstruct a continuous\n“golden chain” of Neoplatonist exegetes (see, e.g.,\nHierocles, De Providentia, apud Photius cod. 214,\n173 a; Proclus, Platonic Theology I, p. 6.16–7.8),\nthere is no institutional continuity between Plotinus and Iamblichus\nand, from this point of view, the situation is obviously different\nfrom that of the ancient Stoa. Iamblichus is not the second founder of\nthe Neoplatonic school for the simple reason that there is no unitary\nNeoplatonic school in Late Antiquity. What scholars call Greek\nNeoplatonism is actually a multifaceted philosophical movement that\ncovers some three centuries and includes several schools scattered\nthroughout the Roman Empire: these schools certainly shared doctrines\nand methods, but their relations were sometimes close, sometimes much\nmore tenuous. Certainly, Iamblichus accepts and further develops some\ndistinctive features of Plotinus’ philosophy and he can be seen\nas a follower of Plotinus and Porphyry: this holds in particular for\nIamblichus’ general metaphysical and philosophical approach, for\nhis account of the One and of the first principles, for his exegesis\nof some works such as Plato’s Parmenides and\nAristotle’s Categories. On the other hand,\nIamblichus’ original position vis-à-vis Plotinus\nand Porphyry emerges clearly with respect to both his theories and his\nmethods (see Taormina 1999). \nOne of the most conspicuous of Iamblichus’ contributions to\nemerging Neoplatonism regards his views on exegesis. A typical Late\nAntique intellectual in this respect, Iamblichus considers the written\nwork of authoritative figures to be sacred and claims to be a mere\ninterpreter of their true, deeper meaning (nous). \nFour overarching principles govern Iamblichus’ exegetical\npractice. First, the idea that every authoritative work is fully\nself-consistent and strives to demonstrate a certain thesis which acts\nas its “goal” or “target” (skopos).\nThis principle is applied rigorously: for instance, since the\nskopos of the Timaeus is the theory of nature, this\nmeans that even the work’s prologue, however autonomous it may\nseem at first glance, should be interpreted in this way (In\nTimaeum [D-1973: Fr. 3]). This amounts to considering literary\nworks living organisms, in accordance with what Plato writes in\nPhaedrus 264C (see Coulter 1976: 73). Guidelines to\ndetermining a given work’s skopos are found in a late\nanonymous composition, the Prolegomena to Platonic Philosophy\n(§§ 21–23). \nThe same source (§ 26) provides a list of twelve Platonic\ndialogues (10 + 2) which, according to Iamblichus, offer an overview\nof his philosophy and thus encompass the whole theory of reality. The\nlist starts with the Alcibiades, taken as an introduction to\nphilosophy and thought to contain the first ten dialogues, as if it\nwere a “seed” (In Alcibiadem [D-1973: Fr. 1).\nThe remaining dialogues are subsequently arranged according to the\ndifferent branches of philosophy (as Porphyry had done with\nPlotinus’ Enneads), while the Aristotelian distinction\nbetween praxis and theōria is simultaneously\ntaken into account. Praxis or ethics is exemplified by the\nGorgias and the Phaedo, the former representing\npolitics, the latter catharsis (in accordance with Iamblichus’\nconception of virtues, on which see below,\n Section 7.2).\n Then comes theōria where, as it seems, the\nCratylus and the Theaetetus are taken to provide\nPlato’s account of logic (the former teaching names, the latter\nconcepts); then come the Sophist and the Politicus,\nwhich supposedly deal with physics—however strange this may seem\nto us—and finally the Phaedrus and the\nSymposium, which deal with theology. The crowning dialogue in\nthe first cycle is the Philebus, because its skopos\nis the all-transcendent Good. Then, as a recapitulation of the first\ncycle, we find a second one consisting in only two works (both of\nwhich, remarkably, feature main characters other than Socrates): the\nTimaeus and the Parmenides, the former subordinated\nto the latter as physics is to theology, although both display a\ndegree of perfection and thus are expected to embrace the whole of\nPlato’s philosophy. This curriculum principle, then, was\nsupposed to bring an author’s œuvre into\naccordance with itself, just as the skopos postulated organic\nunity in a single text. \nAll that was left at this point was to establish harmony between\ndifferent authors; and this is where sumphōnia or\n“agreement” comes into play. Building on Porphyry’s\nefforts (as opposed to Plotinus’ views), Iamblichus fully\nintegrated Aristotle into Platonism (see\n Section 5\n below); he also took into account Pythagoras and the\npseudo-Pythagorean corpus (see\n Section 4.3).\n References to other schools are scarce and mostly critical.\nIamblichus’ philosophical authorities, then, are Plato,\nAristotle, and the Pythagoreans; they were complemented by several\ntexts held to be divinely inspired, of which the two most important\nones are the Chaldean Oracles (a second-century collection of\nverse oracles which provide a Platonic-influenced revelation mostly\nbased on the Timaeus, and which develop a dualistic view\nabout matter and a divine energy called “fire”) and the\npseudo-Orphic Rhapsodies in 24 books. The Chaldean\nOracles at least are known to have been commented upon by\nIamblichus, in a huge commentary comprising at least 28 books\n(Damascius, De Principiis II, 1.5–8). (on\nIamblichus’ religious views, see below,\n Section 6.3.) \nIamblichus brought about a shift towards religion and theology in\nNeoplatonism which proved crucial for the later development of this\nmovement and for its Christian appropriation. The Reply to\nPorphyry, where Iamblichus rejects Porphyry’s\nover-confident intellectualism in theological and religious matters,\nis certainly our major source on debates in early Neoplatonism.\nScholars have traditionally described Iamblichus’ stance as\nirrational, contrasting it with Plotinus and Porphyry’s rational\nand philosophical approach (see Dodds 1951: 285–298). Recent\nscholarship, however, has effectively questioned this view (see\nTanaseanu-Döbler 2013). In his Reply to Porphyry (I, 2\n[SS-2013: 4.5–5.11]) Iamblichus distinguishes three disciplines,\neach with its own distinctive methods: philosophy, theology, and\ntheurgy. Theurgy certainly goes beyond reason and philosophy, but\nIamblichus’ appeal to theurgy and rituals is based on\nsophisticated philosophical views and arguments dealing with the\nnature of divine beings and the status of human souls (see below,\n Section 6).\n It would therefore be misleading to draw a strict opposition between\ntheurgy and rational methods. What is distinctive about Iamblichus\nvis-à-vis Plotinian Platonism is the thorough\nintegration of theological traditions into his account of reality.\nThis emerges in two related areas. Whether or not he wrote a work by\nthis title, Iamblichus is the first Neoplatonist to develop a\n“Platonic theology” (see Proclus, Platonic\nTheology III, 44.1–5 [Saffrey & Westerink\n1968–1997]). This approach will be carried further in Athenian\nNeoplatonism, especially by Proclus. Plotinus had already connected\nthe hypotheses about the One in the second part of Plato’s\nParmenides with his distinction of metaphysical principles\n(see Enn. V, 1.8). Iamblichus goes one step further in that he\nconnects the metaphysical reading of this dialogue with the gods of\nthe Greek pantheon. His interpretation of Plato’s\nParmenides can therefore be described not only as\n“metaphysical” but also as “theological”. In\naddition to this, Iamblichus provides a harmonising account of the\ndifferent theological traditions, again paving the way for the later\ndevelopments in Athenian Neoplatonism (see below,\n Section 3.2).\n In his Reply to Porphyry Iamblichus establishes a triad of\nfoundational traditions: the Egyptian, the Chaldaic and the Greek,\nrepresented by the philosophical wisdom of Pythagoras and Plato. The\nterm “Chaldaic” refers to the Chaldaean Oracles\n(see above,\n Section 2.2).\n The extant evidence suggests that Plotinus and Porphyry accorded\nlimited significance to the Oracles which, instead, become a\ncrucial source for Iamblichus: he wrote an extensive commentary on\nthis work and the revealed Platonizing theology of the\nOracles is an integral part of his thought. The Egyptian\ntradition is represented by the so-called Hermetic books and,\naccording to Iamblichus, this is the genuine source of Greek\nphilosophy (Reply to Porphyry I, 2 [SS-2013:\n4.7–9]). \nIamblichus’ philosophical stance is connected to some views\nwhich separate him from Plotinus and Porphyry and lay the ground for\nlater Neoplatonism, in particular that of Proclus and of the so-called\nAthenian school of the fifth and sixth century AD. These views\nconcern: the status of embodied souls (according to Iamblichus there\nis no superior part of our soul which resides in intelligible being);\nthe role of religious acts revealed by the gods to enable the\nsoul’s ascension to the intelligible realm (as already noted,\nfor Iamblichus, philosophical and intellectual contemplation alone are\nnot sufficient and theurgy is necessary); a harmonising account of the\nvarious theological traditions and the privileged role assigned to\nPythagoras and to the Chaldaean Oracles; an account of\nprinciples and of the metaphysical hierarchy which, while based on\nPlotinus’ and Porphyry’s doctrines, includes more degrees\nand intermediate levels; and, finally, a tendency towards\nscholasticism and the systematization of exegetical methods. \nA picture of Late Antique philosophy jumping from Iamblichus to\nProclus would however be misleading. Actually, more than one century\nseparates Iamblichus’ death from the foundation of the\nNeoplatonist school at Athens by Plutarch of Athens. Some crucial\ndetails escape us: for example, we don’t even know how and when\nIamblichus’ teaching entered the philosophical schools in Athens\n(Goulet 2012). In addition to this, Iamblichus’ posterity in the\nfourth century does not suggest that his philosophical approach was\nimmediately and unanimously followed. Praechter (1910) regarded those\ndisciples of Iamblichus’ who settled in Pergamon, gathering\naround Iamblichus’ student Aedesius, as forming a school (the\n“school of Pergamon”), where rational methods were\nabandoned in favor of theurgy and religious practices. In addition,\nthese philosophers are sometimes regarded as forming an ideologically\nengaged Pagan group threatened by Christian persecution after\nConstantine. Such views are somewhat oversimplistic. Our main source\nfor reconstructing this phase of Neoplatonism is Eunapius’\nLives of Philosophers and Sophists (Goulet 2014). As already\nnoted, Eunapius is a tendentious source, with his own hagiographical\nagenda and with little taste for philosophical technicalities.\nWhatever we make of this, he says that Iamblichus’ students\nformed a large crowd and that those who were eager to learn flocked to\nhim from all parts (see Eunapius Lives VI, 4 [Goulet 2014:\n12–14]). This and other passages suggest that Pagan\nphilosophical teaching definitely did not go underground under and\nafter Constantine (the elite of the Roman Empire was still largely\nPagan at that time). Eunapius’ list of Iamblichus’\nstudents confirms the echo of his teaching: the list includes Sopater\nthe Syrian (see above,\n Section 1.1),\n Aedesius, Eustathius from Cappadocia, Theodorus, and Euphrasius (see\nEunapius Lives V, 5 [Goulet 2014: 12.14–20]). Among\nthese, Theodorus is likely to coincide with Theodorus of Asine who,\nwhile being a student of Iamblichus, is said to have held different\nphilosophical views and reverted to an intellectualist Platonism of\nthe Plotinian sort. Aedesius’ school too certainly hosted\ndifferent positions and internal debates. So Eusebius of Myndus was a\nmember of that school, but apparently held an attitude closer to that\nof Plotinus and he was inclined to reject theurgical and magical\npractices. On the other hand, theurgy was adopted by Aedesius’\nIamblichean disciples such as Chrysanthius of Sardis, Maximus of\nEphesus, and Priscus of Thesprotia. Maximus and Priscus were\ncharismatic figures who are mainly known as masters and counsellors of\nthe Emperor Julian (Julian studied philosophy at Pergamon around 350).\nIamblichus’ teaching actually forms the philosophical background\nof Julian’s project of restoration of Paganism, as shown by\nJulian’s own writings and by the short treatise On the Gods\nand the Cosmos by one Salustius (possibly Saturninius Secundus\nSalutius, a dignitary at Julian’s court). It is worth noting,\nhowever, that even committed theurgists like Maximus did not abandon\nrational methods (we know about Maximus’ work on\nAristotle’s Categories and Prior Analytics). \nIn addition to internal debates among Iamblichus’ disciples,\nfourth-century philosophy includes an overtly anti-Iamblichean trend.\nThis is the case with Themistius (orator, commentator of Aristotle and\nauthoritative member of the Senate in Constantinople), who did not\nendorse Iamblichus’ philosophy and did not show any sympathy for\nhis theurgic and Pythagorean teaching. He actually sharply criticizes\nthe new philosophical approach represented by the “man of\nChalcis” (an allusion to Iamblichus: see Themistius,\nOr. 23, 295b). Themistius engaged in a controversy with\nMaximus of Ephesus over Aristotle’s logic in Constantinople,\nwhere Julian acted as arbiter (Ammonius, In Analytica Priora., p.\n31.11–23).\nFurthermore, Themistius regarded the Pythagorean Archytas’\ntreatise on the categories as spurious and argued that the author was\nnot a Pythagorean at all (Boethius, In Categorias, PL 64, 162 A).\nBy doing so Themistius actually removed the main support for\nIamblichus’ Pythagorean and metaphysical reading of Aristotle.\nIamblichus’ philosophy, then, was only gradually accepted and it\nwas regarded with both consensus and disagreement in its immediate\nposterity. Certainly, Iamblichus’ philosophical approach did not\nentail any abandonment of rational methods, not even among those who\nenthusiastically embraced theurgy. \nAs a general rule, Iamblichus’ system is best characterized as a\nrefined version of Plotinus’. Building on hierarchical hints\nalready present in the Enneads as well as the work of his own\nteacher Porphyry, Iamblichus set about producing a far more complex\npicture of reality, while keeping the same fundamental patterns in\nplace. \nIamblichus’ account of the One is difficult to ascertain, since\nthe crucial testimony (Damascius, De principiis II,\n1.4–16.19 Combès & Westerink) is somewhat oblique. What\nlies beyond doubt is that Iamblichus reacted against Porphyry’s\nintroduction of a first principle “coordinated” with the\nIntelligible Triad by positing two levels above it: on the one hand, a\n“wholly unspeakable principle”—which Theodorus of\nAsine and Damascius incorporated into their own theology, although\nProclus did not: on the subject, see Linguiti 1988—and, on the\nother hand, a principle “uncoordinated with the triad”. In\nthis respect, Iamblichus seems to have wished to distinguish between\ntwo almost contradictory aspects of the first principle: its\ntranscendence with respect to everything else (negative theology),\ni.e., absoluteness in a literal sense; and its causative aspect\n(cataphatic theology). Iamblichus, then, appears to have conceived of\nhis “unspeakable principle” as a safeguard against any\nobjection based on indefinite regress in the chain of causes, while\nthe principle that is “uncoordinated to the triad” is akin\nto Plotinus’ One, insofar as it lies above the Intellect. \nBelow the One is located the intelligible triad of Limit, the\nUnlimited, and the One-Being. This arrangement shows the influence of\nPlato’s Philebus 16C (with the uncoordinated One as the\nCause, and the One-Being as the mikton): this is accounted\nfor in Van Riel 2008. Damascius assimilates this sequence to another\none attributed to “the Pythagoreans”: Monad-Dyad-Triad,\nand, ultimately, to the system of principles inferred from the\nChaldean Oracles: Father-Power-Intellect. It is likely that\nthe same interpretation was already to be found in Iamblichus, given\nthat both Pythagoras and the Chaldeans rank high in his list of\nauthorities. \nWhether Iamblichus introduced the doctrine of “henads”\ninto the teachings of the Neoplatonic School remains controversial\n(see Mesyats 2012; Opsomer in Opsomer et al. 2018: 1365–1366). The henads\n(literally “unities”) are the very first plurality\nemanating from the One: since they are located beyond Being itself,\nthey are meant to bridge the gap between the absolute One and the\nintelligible world. Iamblichean authorship of this theory would make\nit predate Syrianus and Proclus—its first explicit\nproponents—by almost a century, and indeed several hints point\nin that direction, in particular the fact that, according to Proclus,\nIamblichus identified “God and the gods” as the subject of\nthe first hypothesis of Plato’s Parmenides. These\n“gods” might be self-sufficient items located right below\nthe One and, judging by the—admittedly very\nallusive—testimonies of Proclus (references in Saffrey &\nWesterink 1968–1997: III, pp. XVII–XXVI) and Damascius,\nmight indifferently be called “henads” or\n“intelligible gods”, in contradiction with Syrianus’\nand Proclus’ later terminological distinctions. \nThere is also another hint in support of this interpretation.\nDamascius explicitly states that according to Iamblichus divinity is\nclosely correlated to degrees of unity: the intelligible gods are\n“crystallised, as it were, around the One” (De\nprincipiis II, 36.17). According to this conception, the higher a\ngod is situated on the scale of reality, the more\n“unified” and undifferentiated it is, and the less\naccessible to the intellect and to conceptual knowledge: one can only\nknow such realities by resorting to intuition. This doctrine is hinted\nat in various passages of Iamblichus’ Reply to Porphyry\n(where unity, “friendship”—philia—and\ngoodness are all described as fundamental attributes of the gods:\n“whatever Being might be in them, this is equivalent to their\nunity”, I, 19 [SS-2013: 45.8–10]) and is also compatible\nwith his stressing the fact that knowledge of the gods is innate,\nlying as it does within the heart of every individual (I, 3 [SS-2013:\n5.14–20]). From an historical point of view, this gradual\ndiffusion of unity also represents a major contribution to the\nrepresentation of reality as a continuum, thereby somewhat bridging\nthe rift that, following Plotinus, had emerged between the One and the\nIntellect. “Unification” too (henōsis) also\nbecomes a key philosophical term, and this opens up the possibility of\nan anti-intellectual slant, as can be found in a famous extract of the\nReply to Porphyry (II, 11 [SS-2013: 73.1–16]). \nIamblichus’ best-known philosophical doctrine might be the\ndistinction he introduced between the “intelligible”\n(noēton) and the “intellective”\n(noeron). Before Iamblichus, noeron—not a very\ncommon word before the second century A.D.—was used to refer to\nany thinking entity, and Porphyry employs it mostly in association\nwith the soul. From Iamblichus onwards, it becomes a technical term\nwhich exclusively designates the order of gods located right below the\nIntelligible, and endowed with demiurgic functions. The word is found\nwith such a meaning in fourth-century authors in the tradition of\nIamblichus, such as the emperor Julian and Salustius. \nThe idea of distinguishing “seen” and “seeing”\nprinciples (objects and subjects of intellectual knowledge) dates back\nto the early interpretation of Plato’s Timaeus, where\nthe Demiurge appears to behold a Model located outside himself in\norder to gather from it all the data necessary for the creation of the\nCosmos: Middle Platonists thus used to distinguish between the\nDemiurge, Ideas, and Matter. As opposed to, e.g., Longinus (see Syrianus, In Metaphysica, 105.25–28),\nPlotinus had decisively argued that\nintelligibles are actually not to be found outside the Intellect.\nIamblichus instead falls back on more traditional positions and\nexpressly subordinates the Demiurge to the Intelligible Model. As, on\nthe other hand, Iamblichus follows Plotinus’ steps in developing\na doctrine of the One, this results in the Demiurge now being assigned\na secondary rank, as he is surpassed by a plethora of other deities,\nincluding the Intelligible Model (In Timaeum [D-1973: Fr.\n42–46]). He is but the third member of the\n“paternal” triad, itself part of a larger\n“intellective” Hebdomad (Proclus, In Timaeum I,\n308.17–309.13: compare this triad to Fr. 4 [D-1973] In\nPhilebum = Damascius, In Philebum § 105). From this\npoint onwards, until the closing of the Neoplatonic schools,\nidentifying the Demiurge with the First Principle is out of the\nquestion. \nOn the other hand, Iamblichus fully embraces Plotinus’ idea that\nintelligibles are endowed with life, power, activity etc. and\ntherefore multiplicity (at least implicitly). This allows him to\nsuperpose the divine names found in theology (Orpheus, the Chaldeans,\nand the dialogues of Plato dealing with the intelligible) upon a\nconceptual armature: for instance, the Platonic Demiurge is to be\nidentified with the Zeus of the Hellenic tradition. This effort\nreveals itself most conspicuously in Julian, and will find its\ncrowning in Proclus’ Platonic Theology. As a general\nrule, to every philosophical concept in the intelligible world there\ncorresponds some divine level or entity: the idea of such a\ncorrespondence and its application to the sequence of predicates\npresent in the hypotheses of Plato’s Parmenides is\ngenerally assigned to Proclus’ master Syrianus, but several\nhints suggest that it was actually introduced by Iamblichus. One\nexplicit instance of such a term-to-term correspondence is the\nlocalization of the genera of Being within the intellective order\nrather than the intelligible one, because of the former’s higher\ndegree of multiplicity (Proclus, Platonic Theology I,\n52.2–13). This important doctrine implies that the Demiurgic\nintellect is now conceived as some kind of “container” of\nall intelligible ideas, with the reservation that it is less unified\nthan the Model is. \nThrough a comparison between Julian and Proclus (see Lecerf 2012), one\nmay conclude that Iamblichus had conceived of a variety of Demiurges,\nthe main one (identified with Zeus) acting as a principle or\n“monad” for the others. While Zeus creates the world insofar as it is governed by rational laws and populated with beings\npertaining to species and genera (themselves of intelligible nature),\nother demiurgic entities are tasked with informing matter and bodies\n(which undergo a process of generation and corruption) according to\nsuch laws. \nIamblichus already uses the terminology “hypercosmic” vs.\n“encosmic” or “pericosmic” (e.g., Reply to\nPorphyry VIII, 8 [SS-2013: 200.25–27]), inherited from\nMiddle Platonism but destined to become technical in later\nNeoplatonism. In anticipation of this later use, they are meant to\nbridge the gap between the Demiurge and the sublunar realm, although\ntheir exact role remains unclear (the aforementioned passage speaks of\nthe help they give to souls in their ascent). Such lower entities seem\nto be produced according to a geometric progression (cf. In\nTimaeum [D-1973: Fr. 79]). The terminological continuity allows\none to conceive of Iamblichus’ system as the matrix for later\nvariations, particularly Proclus’ one, although it is to be\nnoted that no text bears witness to the presence of Proclus’\nintermediate “intelligible-intellective” and\n“hypercosmic-encosmic” levels in Iamblichus. \nThe hierarchies of “higher genera” will be considered in\n Section 6.1. \nIamblichus’ notion of Nature displays little originality when\ncompared to that of other Neoplatonists. It acts as a productive power\nfor cosmic beings, originating in the celestial gods (Reply to\nPorphyry III, 28 [SS-2013: 127.2–12]), but it does not act\naccording to reason. This ambiguity explains why, depending on the\ncontext, it can be considered either a positive entity, insofar as it\nis part of a reality governed by Providence, or a deceitful, almost\nevil force, a view strongly influenced by the Chaldean\nOracles (see, e.g., V, 18 [SS-2013: 166.18–24]): it comes as no surprise\nthat, in this respect, Nature is also closely associated with Fate.\nThe same ambivalence is to be found with regard to astrology, which\nIamblichus deems useful, yet not the best way to determine the\nidentity of our personal daimōn (IX, 4–5 [SS-2013:\n205.1–207.9]). \nMatter also displays both these traits—integration into the\nworld order and a connection with corporeality and evil.\nIamblichus’ Reply to Porphyry is replete with allusions\nto matter as a taint and source of corruption: “what is mixed\nwith the irrationality and darkness associated with bodies and matter\nis overcome with ignorance” (VI, 4 [SS-2013: 182.7–10]).\nBy contrast, “divine fire” strives to eradicate\nmateriality and generation (V, 12 [SS-2013: 161.2]). In such passages,\nIamblichus inherits the strongly negative views on matter developed by\nMiddle Platonists such as Numenius and further developed by Plotinus.\nHowever, a testimony from John Lydus (De Mensibus\n175.1–176.7 Wünsch) states, apropos Matter, that “nothing imperfect\nstems from the paternal (i.e., demiurgic) triad”. Thus the\npossibility of a monistic interpretation remains open: this evidence\nis studied by Taormina (2016). Accordingly, several testimonies (e.g.,\nSimplicius, In Categorias 418.3–8) also state that Iamblichus attributed no real existence\nto Evil, only a parhupostasis. \nIamblichus’ work exerted a very profound influence on the\nsubsequent course of Neoplatonic philosophy. In particular, he stands\nout as an important theologian owing to the shift he brought about\nwith respect to Plotinianism. With Iamblichus, Plotinus’\neconomical approach to metaphysical principles was developed into\nfull-fledged metaphysical laws: in this respect, Iamblichus emerges as\na remote forerunner of Medieval scholasticism. He himself vindicated a\n“scientific theology” (Reply to Porphyry I, 4\n[SS-2013: 10.18]) and established a canon of texts that gave it the\njustification of tradition.  \nPerhaps the most conspicuous trait of Iamblichean metaphysics is its\nhighly vertical conception of causality. For Iamblichus, an effect\ndoes not enjoy any ontological independence with respect to its cause:\nanything it adds amounts to failure and nothingness. This idea\npredates Iamblichus, but he was the first Pagan philosopher to apply\nit with absolute consistency. Most of his system follows from this one\naxiom, particularly his doctrine of the soul (see\n Section 6).\n The principles’ supervision always lurks in the background:\nsee, e.g., the idea that the intelligible gods “contain”\nthe visible gods (i.e., planets; Reply to Porphyry I, 19\n[SS-2013: 45.14–20]). The idea of the vacuity of effects leads\nto the notion that their sole purpose is to render themselves apt to\nreceive the influx of their causes: Iamblichus calls this\nepitēdeiotēs or “receptivity”. This\nprocess of adaptation accounts for most of the diversity in the\nphenomenal world. Another important law states that “everything\nis in everything according to its property”: Damascius ascribes\nit to both Iamblichus and Porphyry (In Philebum § 130 =\nIamblichus In Philebum [D-1973: Fr. 5]). The last words are the\nmost important: superior beings keep their prerogatives in spite of\nthe existence of a universal homology, which means for example that\ncauses are present to their effects as causes, i.e., are not\nencompassed by them or relegated to their status. In this way,\nIamblichus manages to preserve at the same time the benefits of divine\nimmanence (the world is not abandoned by the gods) and the requirement\nof divine transcendence, which he feels the need to constantly affirm,\nlest he be accused of debasing divinity. \nIamblichus’ programme of a scientific theology is based on newly\ndeveloped terminology, of which we have already seen several examples.\nIt also relies on new structures such as divine orders\n(diakosmoi, taxeis), a notion foreign to Plotinus.\nTheir proliferation does not bother Iamblichus in the least, since\ncentrifugal tendencies are curbed by constantly reasserting the\nfundamental unity of reality. This is provided for through the return\nof the same processes in a more or less absolute form (for instance,\nwhat exists in a unified manner in the universal Paradigm as a whole\nappears again in individual paradigms, yet only partially: see In\nTimaeum [D-1973: Fr. 43]). Recurring metaphysical laws serve the\nsame purpose, as do schemes such as the regrouping of divine entities\nin accordance with meaningful numbers, e.g., triads, a structure that\nadequately accounts for uni-multiplicity in reality since it treats as\none single process the succession of an immobile first state\n(monē), a dynamic procession (proodos) and a\nreturn or “conversion” to the first element\n(epistrophē; see In Timaeum [D-1973: Fr. 53]).\nTriads are thus a prime example of what modern commentators have named\nthe “law of mean-terms”, i.e., the need for a tertium\nquid to provide a mediation between two levels. Continuity is\nthereby introduced in the picture, although the latter remains\nresolutely holistic. The whole stands in relation to its parts as a\ncause to its effect: in this sense, it may be said that Iamblichus\ncreated and almost deified the Neoplatonic system as a unified and\ncoherent account of reality, avoiding any recourse to dualism. \nAs we have seen, Iamblichus posited at the top of his system, below\nthe One but above the Intelligible—and thus at a supra-essential\nlevel—the dual principles of Limit (peras) and the\nUnlimited (or Infinite: apeiron). These principles belong to\nthe Pythagorean tradition (see, e.g., Philolaus Fr. 1 Huffman and\nNicomachus, Introduction to Arithmetic II, 18, 4), although the main catalysts\nresponsible for their integration into the Neoplatonic system were two\nindirect accounts, Plato’s Philebus (see above,\n Section 3.1)\n and Aristotle, Metaphysics Α, 5 (987a15–19):\n \n(the Pythagoreans) thought that finitude and infinity were not\nattributes of certain other things, e.g., of fire or earth or anything\nelse of this kind, but that infinity itself and unity itself were the\nsubstance of the things of which they are predicated (trans. Ross).\n \nCloser to Iamblichus, one must also mention the precedent of Eudorus\nof Alexandria (apud Simplicius, In Phys.\n118.22–28), as well as Plotinus’ acknowledgment of\nsomething apeiron within the Intellect (Ennead II, 4\n[12]). \nThe importance of this Pythagoreanizing slant can hardly be\noverstated. In agreement with Iamblichus’ vertical conception of\nreality, it means that everything below this dyad is to be regarded as\na mix of determination and indetermination: and this includes gods, as\nwell as Forms such as those contained within the Model, some of which\nare claimed to partake in movement and alterity (see In\nTimaeum [D-1973: Fr. 46]), while less elaborate versions of\nPlatonism would rather view them as solely determinate, viz.\nthinkable. In a text from Simplicius’ commentary on the\nCategories (135.10–16 [DL-1972: Fr. 37]), the\nproductive capacity of the One appears to reflect these two\ndimensions:  \nSince the power of the One, from which all quantity is generated, is\nextended unchanged … and gives definition to each thing as it\nproceeds from itself, in that it pervades the whole in an entirely\nundivided manner, it brings the continuous into being, by making its\nprogression single and uninterrupted …: but in that it comes to\na halt in its progression at each of the forms and defines each\n… it brings about the discrete (trans. Fleet). \nConsequently, Iamblichus came to the conclusion that all things\npartake in opposition, a phenomenon most conspicuous in the sublunary\nworld, as the philosopher notes in the context of an allegorical\nexegesis of the prologue to Plato’s Timaeus (In\nTimaeum [D-1973: Fr. 10]). Thus, it appears that\nIamblichus’ goal in introducing the Limit–Unlimited pair\nwas to account for the genesis of multiplicity and alterity, Limit\nproviding definition and intelligibility, while the Unlimited enables\ninfinite flux and iteration within all individual items partaking of\nthe same form: this interpretation is, at any rate, in line with the\nepitēdeiotēs or “receptivity” axiom\n(see\n Section 3.5\n above), which states that the effect receives the causal influx\naccording to what it is itself, and thus always imperfectly. This may\nbe seen as Iamblichus’ equivalent of Plotinus’\nintellectual vitalism (the notion that the intelligible world is\nintrinsically active, being Life itself): it allows for considerable\nmetaphysical dynamism. To be sure, Limit retains axiological\nprecedence over the Unlimited, but indetermination can no longer be\nconceived of as a mere by-product of matter’s resistance to\nform. Rather, while it is true that higher principles are more\ncharacterized by Limit and lower ones by the Unlimited, each and every\nthing reflects, to some extent, both of these principles. \nLimit and the Unlimited are also principles active among mathematical\nentities (On General Mathematical Science, chap. 13). Here\nthey play a role similar to that of the pairs Monad and Dyad, Odd and\nEven, or Same and Other according to Nicomachus of Gerasa, the\nneo-Pythagorean author of the Introduction to Arithmetic and\none of Iamblichus’ intellectual heroes; similar pairs studied by\nthe mathematical sciences are “continuous” and\n“discrete” (sunekhes, diōrismenon),\n“magnitude” and “plurality”\n(megethos, plēthos: cf. Nicomachus,\nIntr. arith. I, 2, 4–5), all of which concur\nto form a dynamic picture of reality. The four mathematical\nsciences—arithmetic, which takes precedence over the others;\ngeometry, music and astronomy—each study a corresponding kind of\nbeing, and were the object of On Pythagoreanism vol. IV and\nVIII–X respectively (see the plan of the work as outlined by\nO’Meara 1989). \nIamblichus’ interest in mathematics is part of a larger trend\nthat includes authors such as Theon of Smyrna and Calcidius, but\nexcludes Plotinus and, to a lesser extent, Porphyry. For Iamblichus,\nmathematics is both a scientific discipline and concerns a realm of\nbeing, intermediate between the intelligible and the sensible: the\nlatter view is influenced by Aristotelian ontology as well as by the\nPlatonic analogy of the Line (Republic, 509d–511e), but\nwith the Pythagorean proviso that mathematical entities “exist\nin themselves” and that each number possesses a distinct\nessence. \nThe study of mathematics allows the soul to disengage itself from the\nmaterial world, thus providing a starting point towards higher being.\nMore interestingly, mathematics is assigned symbolic significance in a\nvariety of fields: vol. V–VII of On Pythagoreanism (now\nlost) dealt with the mathematical teachings that can be drawn\nconcerning ethics, physics and theology respectively (the anonymous\nTheologoumena arithmeticae might provide some insight into\nIamblichus’ view of the relation between arithmetic and\ntheology, as they include extensive quotes from Nicomachus as well as\nIamblichus’ first teacher Anatolius). Mathematics is therefore\nversatile and multivalent in its essence (see, e.g., On General\nMathematical Science, chap. 15; 18), and thus closely associated\nwith the soul (ibid., chap. 9). It is also very likely that\nSyrianus’ distinction of various types of\n“number”—in descending order: eidetic, mathematical,\nphysical, cf., e.g., In Metaphysica\n122.11–16—stems from Iamblichean teachings. \nIamblichus’ writings on mathematics were influential, and are\nused, e.g., in Syrianus’ commentary on the Metaphysics\nand Proclus’ commentary on Euclid. His views on the\nquadrivium, drawing upon Nicomachus, were also adopted by\nMartianus Capella and Boethius, and through them became an integral\npart of education in the Middle Ages. \nWhile Iamblichus took great pains to study mathematics in detail, its\ntrue meaning, according to him, is not of a “technical”\nnature: rather, it is meant to constitute a form of philosophical\nascesis: \nIf we intend to practice mathematics in a Pythagorean\nmanner, it is necessary to pursue with zeal its divinely inspired,\nelevating, purifying and perfective way. (On General\nMathematical Science, chap. 22) \nIndeed, as part of his sumphōnia programme, Iamblichus\nstrove to fully integrate Pythagorean teaching into the Hellenic\ndogmatic tradition, making Pythagoras the recipient of a divine\nrevelation handed down by Orpheus through the mysterious figure of\n“Aglaophamus” (De Vita Pythagorica 146). Book II\nof On Pythagoreanism, the Protrepticus, while using\na variety of sources, also taps into the Pythagorean repertoire with\nwisdom texts such as the Golden Verses. Building on the then\nwidely accepted axiom that the truth had already been revealed in\nremote times and then merely reformulated—if not\ntwisted—by recent writers, he accepted as authoritative the\npseudo-Pythagorean corpus for which he (along with Stobaeus, who knew\nthe Iamblichean œuvre quite well) is one of our main\nsources: on Iamblichus’ library of Pythagorean texts, see Macris\n2002. Iamblichus made the most conspicuous use of these texts in his\nlost Commentary on the Categories, where ps.-Archytas’\nOn the All was repeatedly quoted as the source of the\nAristotelian treatise (see below,\n Section 5.1). \nIn order to assess Iamblichus’ reliability as a witness of\nancient Pythagoreanism, one has to take into account a variety of\nfactors, including his attitude towards the information available to\nhim (ranging from literal dependence to creative elaboration for his\nown ideological and systematic purposes). This is crucial, since the\nPythagorean Life in particular is one of our major sources on\nthis subject (for details, see the studies collected in Huffman 2014;\nvon Albrecht et al. 2002). \nIamblichus wrote an extensive commentary on the Categories,\nfragments of which have been preserved by Simplicius and Dexippus (a\nstudent of Iamblichus): in addition to literal quotes, Iamblichus is\nbehind much of Simplicius’ extant exegesis of this treatise. We\nalso have evidence that Iamblichus wrote a commentary on\nAristotle’s Prior Analytics and we know about his\nexegetical work on the De interpretatione and the De\ncaelo (see Opsomer 2015). From the first century BC onwards,\nPlatonist philosophers had been familiar with Aristotle’s\nCategories: Platonists such as Eudorus of Alexandria and\nNicostratus raised objections against Aristotle’s doctrine;\nPlotinus wrote a very important treatise On the Genera of\nBeing, where he critically discussed Aristotle’s categories\n(Ennead VI, 1–3). To the best of our knowledge,\nhowever, no Platonist wrote a commentary on Aristotle’s\nCategories before Porphyry, who was the author of two\ncommentaries on this treatise: a short and extant elucidation in a\nquestion-and-answer format and a very extensive commentary in seven\nbooks dedicated to someone called Gedalius, which is now lost. In\naddition, Porphyry wrote an introduction to logic, the\nIsagoge, which is closely connected to the\nCategories. With Porphyry, then, Aristotle’s\nCategories became an integral part of the Platonist\ncurriculum and this was a crucial move for the subsequent history of\nLate Antique and medieval philosophy. As is often the case,\nIamblichus’ exegetical work relies on Porphyry but introduces\nsome changes which are probably aimed to supplement (and possibly\nsupplant) Porphyry’s approach. Simplicius informs us that\nIamblichus followed the great and now lost commentary written by\nPorphyry, while adding two distinctive features. First Iamblichus\n“applied his Intellective Theory (noera theōria)\neverywhere, to almost all of the chapter-headings” (Simplicius,\nIn Categorias, 2.13–15 [DL-1972: Fr. 2], trans. Chase; see\nDillon 1997). Iamblichus employs the same expression, noera\ntheōria in the opening section of the Reply to\nPorphyry (I, 2 [SS-2013: 4.16]), in a passage where he\ncharacterizes the mode of inquiry that is typical of theology.\nSecondly, Iamblichus took Archytas’ treatise On the All\nto be Aristotle’s source and he developed a thoroughly\nPythagorising interpretation of the Categories (Simplicius,\nIn Categorias, 2.15–25 [DL-1972: Fr. 2]; see Hoffmann 1980).\nArchytas’ treatise is actually a forgery which scholars now date\nto the first century BC. Iamblichus, however, took it to be a genuine\nwork by Archytas and in doing so he claimed a Pythagorean origin for\nAristotle’s theory. To sum up, Iamblichus’ exegesis of the\nCategories was an integral part of his Pythagorean\nphilosophical programme and in interpreting the Categories\nIamblichus made use of his metaphysical and theological views.\nApparently, Iamblichus pushed his reading of Aristotle along\nPlatonic/Pythagorean lines so far that (as later sources report) he\ndid not refrain from assuming that Aristotle was not opposed to Plato\non the theory of Ideas (see Elias/David, In Categorias,\n123.2–3). \nIamblichus’ interpretation characteristically included a\ndefinition of the “target” (skopos) of\nAristotle’s treatise, which Iamblichus regarded as focusing on\nsignifying expressions insofar as they signify things via concepts\n(see Hoffmann 1987). This view was not new and Simplicius traces it\nback to the previous tradition starting from the early Peripatetic\ncommentators (Simplicius, In Categorias, 13.15–18).\nIamblichus, however, added two distinctive features. First, he gave a\nmore systematic account of the target of Aristotle’s treatise\n(for example, Porphyry too claimed that Aristotle’s\nCategories focus on simple signifying expressions insofar as\nthey signify things, but to the best of our knowledge he did not refer\nto concepts). In addition to this, Iamblichus’ discussion of\nsemantics incorporated a Neoplatonist account of language and\nsignification grounded in Neoplatonic metaphysics and psychology\n(Simplicius, In Categorias, 12.16–13.12: see Griffin 2012).\nIamblichus referred to analogy (analogia) as a resource that\nexplains how Aristotle’s account of categories can be applied to\nintelligible beings too. For example, Simplicius reports that\naccording to Iamblichus the property of being receptive of contraries\nwhile being one and the same in number (see Arist., Cat., 5,\n4a10–11) applies to all levels of substance (both sensible and\nintelligible) via analogy (kata analogian, Simpl., In\nCategorias, 116.25–26 [DL-1972: Fr. 33]): in intelligible\nsubstance contraries belong to substance simultaneously whereas in\nsensible substance they exist successively. Accordingly, different\nlevels of being reveal corresponding structures (where lower degrees\nin the hierarchy entail increasing multiplicity and dispersion). This\nmetaphysical framework accounts for Iamblichus’ views about\ngenera and predication. Iamblichus is critical of the previous\nPeripatetic tradition: he criticizes Alexander of Aphrodisias for\nmistakenly regarding corporeal and incorporeal beings as species\nranked under the same genus (that of substance, ousia)\n(Simplicius, In Categorias, 83.20–23 [DL-1972: Fr. 24]).\nIamblichus’ point is that the Peripatetic reading of the\nCategories does not account for the hierarchical structure of\nreality. On Iamblichus’ view, full weight should instead be\ngiven to the hierarchical notion of the genus as a unity of derivation\nfrom a principle (actually the genus is both the principle itself and\nthe hierarchy of items depending on it). This structure does not\nentail that levels ranked in the same genus share any common item.\nRather, different and hierarchically ordered levels are connected via\nanalogy, so that lower items mirror higher ones while not sharing any\ncommon item with them. Analogy, then, allows Iamblichus to combine two\ncomplementary aspects of his metaphysics: on the one hand the vertical\nhierarchy that separates different levels of beings, on the other hand\nthe continuity that connects these different levels together within a\nunified whole. Iamblichus’ approach emerges in his account of\nessential or synonymous predication (the predication of items within\nthe same category). Porphyry argued that in this kind of predication\nsubject and predicate denote two different items, the\nakatakakton (uncoordinated or unallocated) and the\nkatatetagmenon (coordinated or allocated) (Simplicius, In\nCategorias, 53.6–9; 79.24–30). The meaning of these\nexpressions is debated. The “allocated genus” is to be\nidentified with the in re universal shared by particulars;\nthe unallocated may be either the separated and Platonic ante\nrem universal or the abstracted and post rem universal\nconcept. Whatever we make of Porphyry’s view, Iamblichus started\nfrom Porphyry’s exegesis and gave a different slant to it (see\nChiaradonna 2007). In doing so Iamblichus suggested that\nAristotle’s essential predication is a way of expressing the\nparticipation of corporeal beings in their transcendent genera\n(Simplicius, In Categorias, 53.9–18 [DL-1972: Fr. 16]). More\nprecisely, “Socrates is man” would be a way of expressing\nthe fact that the corporeal Socrates participates in the transcendent\nForm of Man. Separate genera provide the basis for essential\npredication, though they are not properly predicated in themselves\n(what is predicated is rather the participated item). Interestingly,\nIamblichus refers to the technical notion of ptōsis\n(“case”), which is associated with Aristotle’s\naccount of paronymy in the Categories: a ptōsis\nis an inflected form of a term (such as “grammatical” or\n“courageous”) which is paronymous with the noun form and\n\nderives from it (“grammatical” and\n\n“courageous” are both adjectival forms which derive from\n“grammar” and “courage” respectively). So\nIamblichus held that in the predicative statement “Socrates is\nman”, “man” improperly occurs in the predication\ninstead of its ptōsis: Iamblichus is probably referring\nhere to an adjectival construction like “human”. Such a\nparonymous form would correctly refer to the participation of Socrates\nin his transcendent Form. Simplicius informs us too that Iamblichus\nfocused on Aristotle’s account of motion and activity: Plotinus\nhad criticized Aristotle for not regarding motion as a single category\nand had argued that motion in sensible beings is a form of complete\nactivity (Simplicius, In Categorias, 303.35–306.12 [DL-1972:\nFr. 86]). Iamblichus rejects Plotinus’ account and aims to\nintegrate Aristotle’s account of sensible motion as\n“incomplete actuality” into a Platonist philosophical\nframework (see Taormina 1999: chap. III). \nIamblichus’ exegesis of the Categories (in particular\nhis account of genera of hierarchical structures and his use of\nanalogy) sheds light on other areas of his philosophy and forms the\nbackground of Iamblichus’ criticism of Porphyry’s account\nof divine hierarchy in the Reply to Porphyry (Chiaradonna\n2018). There Iamblichus rejects Porphyry’s account of divine\nhierarchy as misleading, since Porphyry regarded classes of divine\nbeings as species ranked under the same genus and determined by\n“properties” (idiōmata) that act as specific\ndifferentiae (Reply to Porphyry, I, 4 [SS-2013:\n7.21–8.6]). In so doing, Porphyry ruins the very idea of\nhierarchy: divine comes to be a common genus which is\npredicated of all of its species, in the same way as animal\nis predicated of (say) horse and dog. Against\nPorphyry, Iamblichus calls for a qualified use of logical notions\nwhich makes the hierarchical relation between different classes of\ndivine beings clear. Each level differs from the others as a whole and\nnot in the same way as different species are divided under the same\ncommon genus. As said above, in his interpretation of the\nCategories Iamblichus argued that the genus is a hierarchical\nrelation in which items from different levels are analogically\nconnected to their origin. This can be set in parallel with what\nIamblichus says in the Reply to Porphyry:  \nBut if one were to apply an analogical principle of identity to\ndifferent genera, for example to the many genera of gods, and again to\nthose among the demons and heroes, and lastly in the case of souls,\nthen one might succeed in defining their specific characteristics.\n(Reply to Porphyry, I, 4 [SS-2013: 10.25–11.4], trans.\nCDH-2003) \nAccording to Iamblichus, “soul” is but the last and\nweakest link in the chain of “higher genera”\n(kreittona genē). In the Reply to Porphyry,\nthose entities are enumerated in full:\ngods—archangels—angels—demons—heroes—archons\nruling the world—enmattered archons—souls. This is a token\nof Iamblichus’ receptiveness towards the religious speculation\nof his day, although most of this theological bestiary was in fact\nalready present in Porphyry’s Letter to Anebo.\nIamblichus’ acceptance of “evil demons” (cf.\nO’Neill 2018) is particularly interesting, since it seems to\nundermine Iamblichus’ monism and providentialism, and is best\nexplained as reflecting the influence of the Chaldean\nOracles. \nIn contradistinction with the gods, the soul receives a plethora of\nnegative traits: it is imperfect, intermittent, it leans towards\nmatter; and while the causes of Order and Beauty exist in full\ncommunion with the gods, the soul can never be given more than a mere\nshare of it (Reply to Porphyry I, 6–7 [SS-2013:\n15.14–17.7]). The immutability of this celestial hierarchy is\nstriking, and foreshadows the later works of Hierocles, Proclus, and\npseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. Although the soul’s\nversatility—its ability to “make use of varied forms and\nlife-principles”—allows it to attach itself to superior\nbeings and lay claim “to receiving perfection as an angelic,\nimmaculate soul” (Reply to Porphyry II, 2 [SS-2013:\n51.10–52.11]), on closer reading it appears to be unable to\nescape its condition by virtue of its own essence: its ascent is never\ncomplete (it is an endeavor, ephesis or\nhenōsis, with a suffix expressing verbal action) and it\npresupposes, moreover, the gods’ “goodwill and\nillumination”. Porphyry had previously drawn a similar\ndistinction between demons that are so “by essence”\n(kat’ ousian) or by mere “relation”\n(kata skhesin), the latter being those humans who, by virtue\nof their excellent life, are allotted demonic status. On the other\nhand, the human soul is also unable to be relegated to the rank of\nanimals via metempsychosis (cf. the title of one of Iamblichus’\npsychological works preserved by Nemesius of Emesa, On the Nature\nof Man, chap. 2, p. 35.7–11 Morani). Some points, however,\nremain unclear, such as how exactly Iamblichus’ generic\ndistinction between human souls and “divine” ones would\nfit within such a structure; or what we are to make of the souls of\nexceptional, even semi-divine characters such as Pythagoras or the\ntheurgists. Similar preoccupations underlie Frs. 82 and 83 In\nTimaeum [D-1973], interpreting Timaeus 41d. \nLastly and perhaps most importantly, the soul is irremediably inferior\nto the intellect. Rejecting any internalist interpretation of\nintellectual processes, Iamblichus regards them as the result of the\nsoul’s illumination by a transcendent entity. Our information on\nthis matter is to be gathered mostly from the late Aristotelian\ncommentators, pseudo-Simplicius (see In De anima\n313.1–10, with a reference to the “unparticipated”\nintellect which, if genuinely Iamblichean, would predate Proclean\nterminology) and Priscian of Lydia (Metaphrasis in\nTheophrastum): these relatively neglected texts are the object of\nthe pioneering work Steel 1978. Indeed, such a position implies some\nknowledge of the philosophical debates on this issue within the\nAristotelian tradition (Theophrastus, Alexander). Its significance is\nenormous, insofar as it directly leads to the rejection of\nPlotinus’ doctrine of the undescended soul: that is, the idea\nthat something of the soul always remains in the intelligible world.\nThus, rejecting the notion that the soul shares homeomereia\nwith the remaining intellectual entities, Iamblichus writes:  \nthe doctrine opposed to this separates soul, insofar as it is born\nsecond with regard to the intellect as a distinct hypostasis, and\ninterprets what, in it, partakes of intellect as something dependent\nfrom intellect, although it is susceptible of individual existence;\nand it separates it from all the higher genera. (De anima,\nsect. 7 [DF-2002])  \nIamblichus also fiercely attacks Plotinus (as well as Theodorus of\nAsine) for the assumption that “there is something in us that is\nimpassible and always thinking” (In Timaeum [D-1973:\nFr. 87]; on this text see Rist 1975 and Dillon 2005). However, here\nagain the attitude of the superior souls with regard to their descent\nis somewhat obscure: according to Damascius (In Parm. IV,\n24.1–7 Combès & Westerink), Iamblichus taught that the\nfirst class of souls “descends while not descending”, and\nthat the descent “only effects a presence alongside what is\nhere”. This problem was tackled by van den Berg (1997; opting\nfor the existence of unaffected pure souls and thus positing\nIamblichus as an intermediary between Plotinus and Proclus) and\nTaormina (2012; emphasizing that every soul remains separated from the\nintelligible and only relates to it through participation). It is, in\nany case, clear that Iamblichus conceived of the soul’s presence\nin this world as something natural and normal, not as a transitory\nexile, even less as “always an evil” (the theory of\nCronius, Numenius and Harpocration, criticized in De anima\nsect. 29 [DF-2002]). \nIt is fair to say that Iamblichus—in this respect closer to\nPorphyry—focuses more closely than Plotinus on the soul’s\nindwelling within the body and on the actions it performs alongside\nit. In what remains of his treatise On the Soul, he reviews\nall sorts of historical theses about the composition, powers and\nactivities of the soul, and does not hesitate to engage his\nNeoplatonic predecessors. \nIn the available testimonies (Priscian in particular: see the\nassessment in Huby 1993), the soul is constantly associated with the\nnotion of “life”. The latter is approached here not so\nmuch as an essential psychic property (as had been the case in the\nPhaedo), as in terms of the corporeal\n“life-principles” (zōai, most often in the\nplural) that the soul is said to project outside of itself in order to\nget a hold on the external world:  \ninsofar as it puts forth other levels of life that incline towards generation and consort with the body, thus far (soul) is involved in the order of the\ncosmos (Letter to Macedonius, apud Stobaeus,\nAnthology II, 8, 45 [DP-2009: 25]).  \n\nIn this manner, psychic\nactivities that involve a relationship with external objects (such as\nsense-perception) presuppose a dialectic relationship between the\nsoul’s essence and the multiplicity of powers it deploys: the\nindividual and immaterial entity “soul” goes out of itself\nto grasp enmattered items, before going back (literally\n“converting”, epistrephein) in order to compare\nthe data thus aggregated to (stable) Forms, which lend it\nintelligibility. As a result,  \nthe particular soul, as being in the middle of all the kinds of things\nof this world, and being divided together with them and being\nmultiplied along with them, not only remains but also changes, living\nthrough so many partial lives. And not only with regard to its\ndispositions, but also with regard to its substance it changes\nsomewhat. (Priscian, Metaphrasis 32.15–19 [trans. Huby\n1993: 8])  \nThe imagination, being torn between sensibility and abstract\nintellection, whose difference it helps bridge, functions in a similar\nway and contributes to making the soul the median entity par\nexcellence. \nSensibility, then, would seem to be proof of the soul’s radical\ninability to remain in itself, as opposed to the intellect, which is\nimmobile and in actuality by its own nature (another sign of the fact\nthat the unity of the soul is no longer considered self-evident is the\nintroduction of the so-called “vehicle” of the soul, a\nspiritual garment that acts as an interface between the soul and\nbodies: on this subject, cf. Finamore 1985). What stands out as most\nremarkable is the notion that the soul’s essence is also\nchallenged in the course of sensitive acts. Iamblichus here inherits\nthe Aristotelian terminology of Essence/Substance\n(ousia)—Power (dynamis)—Activity\n(energeia): a single essence—say, the human\nsoul—acts as a substratum for a plurality of powers (sensitive,\nintellective, imaginative, etc.), and those powers are in turn\nactualized in a greater plurality of activities (sense-perception,\naisthēsis, of x, y, or z;\nintellection, noēsis, about x, y, or\nz). These three terms are hierarchised, insofar as the soul can\nremain inactive: but in Aristotle, this hierarchy remains largely\nimplicit, contrary to Iamblichus and his unequivocal conception of\nvertical causality (see above,\n Section 3.5).\n In applying his own principles, Iamblichus argues that, since the\neffect is nothing outside of its cause, any flaw connatural to the\neffect would also have to be preassumed in the cause. Since, then, the\nsoul’s activities show instability and imperfection,\nthis inability to act consistently and permanently points to a break\nin its very essence (cf. De anima sect. C [DF-2002] =\npseudo-Simplicius, In De anima 89.33–35). \nThis is Iamblichus’ notion of the “changing self”,\nas first expounded by Steel 1978. Such a conception of the human soul\nrepresents a major break in the Platonic tradition, which until then\nhad been prone to emphasize the soul’s inner dignity and\ndivinity: on the other hand, it is a very convenient way to account\nfor human fallibility. One could interpret it as a literal exegesis of\nTimaeus 35a: the Demiurge creates the soul’s essence as\na mix of indivisible and divisible Being, so that—one might\nthink—it is no more indivisible than it is divisible. By the\nsame reasoning, Iamblichus concludes that the soul is at the same time\nchanging and unchanging, dying and undying. This, at least, is what\ncharacterizes “particular” souls (merikai or\nen merei: a terminology propagated by Iamblichus—see\nReply to Porphyry V, 2 [SS-2013: 149.26]—before it\nbecame usual in later authors). The case of divine souls is less\nclear-cut, since they are able to mend the gap between essence and\nactivity (De anima sect. 20–21; see also 18). It is\nunclear whether—and how—this picture can be reconciled\nwith Iamblichus’ allusions to “two souls”, one\noriginating in the intelligible, the other given to us by celestial\ninfluences (Reply to Porphyry VIII, 6 [SS-2013:\n199.1–12]). \nBelittled as it is in the grand scheme of things, and unable to\nachieve any perpetual union with the intelligible world, the human\nsoul is deemed connatural to “nothingness” (Reply to\nPorphyry III, 18 [SS-2013: 108.16–17]). It now needs\nexternal help from the gods—that is, grace—in\norder to perform any relevant action. Broken in its essence,\nit is, however, able to regain some ground through its\nactivity. Co-action with the gods, “godlike\naction” (theourgia, i.e., theurgy), is the purpose of\nthe Iamblichean soul, which it attains through religious acts such as\nprayer, offerings, sacrifice, etc., that is the very liturgy that\nPorphyry had attacked in the Letter to Anebo. Hence the\nnecessary connection between two fields, psychology and the philosophy\nof religion, which was clearly set out by Shaw (1995). Ritual is given\nprecedence over philosophical ascesis or discursive thinking, although\nIamblichus would say that he is merely giving philosophy its due place\nrather than abolishing it: it is also true that he underlines the need\nfor the religious practitioner to be virtuous, individual sanctity\nbeing a requisite to make the medium apt to receive the gods’\ninflux. But Iamblichus heavily stresses that the key to the whole\nprocess always lies in the gods: very interestingly,\n“human”, “artificial” or “natural”\ncontributions are equally side-lined and relegated to the status of\nmere auxiliary causes (see, e.g., Reply to Porphyry III, 9\n[SS-2013: 89.7–9]). He is also adamant about the human inability\nto extort any effect from the higher beings (i.e., via\n“magic”), since they are by nature impassible. \nIt remains beyond doubt that his stance on the matter is\nanti-intellectualist in nature and thus in stark contrast with the\nteachings of Plotinus and Porphyry. One does not start with\nself-knowledge, as Porphyry had set out to demonstrate in a treatise\nOn the phrase: “Know thyself”, which he had\ndedicated to Iamblichus, no doubt cognizant of all the implications of\nthis (Fr. 273 Smith = Stobaeus, Anthology III, 21, 26). Instead,\nknowledge of the gods encompasses self-knowledge (Reply to\nPorphyry X, 1 [SS-2013: 212.2–3]) and should be taken as\nthe correct starting-point. What remains intellectualistic in\nIamblichus’ approach is the conviction that not acting in the\nlight of theological knowledge leads to the failure of the ritual\nprocess (ibid. II, 10 [SS-2013: 68.25–69.20]).\nAccordingly, the best theurgist is also the best theologian: and since\nIamblichus’ theology is highly philosophical in nature, insofar\nas it strives to identify the Pagan gods with metaphysical forces or\nconcepts and submits them to the authority of the Platonic One, it\nseems necessary that, in Iamblichus’ system, precedence be given\nto Neoplatonist religious specialists deriving their information from\nthe appropriate literature. In this respect, theurgy represents a\nrationalization of the irrational, rather than the converse. It is\nalso important to note that the conflict between the\nPlotino-Porphyrian approach and Iamblichus’ one does not simply\namount to a conflict between philosophy and religion; rather, it\nopposes two different modes of access to the divine, with\nIamblichus’ predecessors laying emphasis on silent ascesis and\nthe shedding of our external identity, and accordingly viewing\ncorporeality and materiality as something inherently negative. \nAccording to Iamblichus, the gods help mankind overcome its inherent\nweakness by revealing symbols to them that will establish some sort of\nconnection: one of the criticisms he lays on Porphyry is that his\nviews will “leave earth deprived of the presence of the superior\nbeings” (Reply to Porphyry I, 8 [SS-2013:\n21.12–13]). These symbols may differ in nature: items, rituals,\nmyths, theological revelations such as the Chaldean Oracles,\netc.; and most of them are placed under the patronage of a particular\ndeity, thus creating a “chain” (seira) of, say,\nsun-like entities. In this manner, Iamblichean ontology necessarily\nleads to cultural traditionalism; it also opens up the possibility of\na grandiose sumphōnia of all Pagan schools or currents,\nbe they Hellenic or “barbarian”, the latter actually being\nassigned even more prestige insofar as the Egyptians, Assyrians,\nPhoenicians etc. enjoy greater antiquity\nand—supposedly—avoided innovation, contrary to the Greeks\n(Reply to Porphyry VII, 5 [SS-2013: 192.22–24]). A\nwhole new field thus opened up for Platonists in which they could\nexercise their exegetical virtuosity in search of remarkable\nanalogies. It is no wonder, then, that Iamblichus’ views were\nheartily embraced by later proponents of a “Pagan\nrevival”, of whom the most prominent was Julian the Apostate: a\nRoman emperor as well as the pupil of Maximus of Ephesus, who was a\nphilosopher in the tradition of Iamblichus in addition to being the\nmost infamous theurgist of his time. \nNeoplatonism has often been regarded as a theological and\nother-worldly philosophy which assigns little (if any) significance to\npolitics and conceives of ethics merely as an ascetic path for the\nseparation of the soul from the body. This view has recently been\nquestioned by D.J. O’Meara and the significance of Neoplatonist\npolitical philosophy is gaining increasing attention (see\nO’Meara 2003; Schramm 2013). Iamblichus wrote a whole treatise\nOn virtues, which is lost but whose content can be inferred\nfrom later sources. In addition to this, references to ethics and\npolitics can be gathered from his extant works, especially the letters\npreserved by Johannes Stobaeus (see DP-2009; TP-2010). It is a notable\nfact that some of Iamblichus’ interlocutors were influential\nfigures in the fourth-century Roman empire, as is for example the case\nwith Sopater of Apamea (see above,\n Section 1.1).\n It is somewhat difficult to clearly grasp Iamblichus’ position\non these issues, since his treatise on virtues is lost, the later\ntestimonia are cursory and Iamblichus’ letters are for the most\npart introductory and refrain from philosophical technicalities. \nThe extant evidence nonetheless suffices to outline some of\nIamblichus’ views. Two letters focus on providence, fate and\nfree will against the background of Iamblichus’ account of\ncausation, which sees the One as the principle of all being and the\nlower levels of reality as characterized by increasing degrees of\nmultiplicity (see the letters to Macedonius and Sopater: Johannes\nStobaeus I, 5, 17 and I, 5, 18). Iamblichus identifies the sphere of\noperation of fate with nature, i.e., “the immanent causal\nprinciple of the cosmos and that which immanently comprises the\ntotality of causes of the realm of generation” (DP-2009: 35). These views are reminiscent\nof the Stoic deterministic model of causation, but Iamblichus also\nemphasises that the soul contains within itself a free and independent\nlife and is able to emancipate itself from worldly influences (see\nJohannes Stobaeus I, 8, 45a). \nThis theological and metaphysical framework also grounds\nIamblichus’ views about politics. In his letters he describes\nthe art of rulership as a kind of divinisation based on wisdom:\nthrough wisdom human beings are assimilated to gods and political\nrulership is an image of divine rulership in cosmos (see Johannes\nStobaeus III, 3, 26). Leadership is connected with philanthropy, which\nmakes the ruler mild, pleasant and approachable. Such views outline a\ncharacteristically theocratic view. Elsewhere, however, Iamblichus\nsuggests a more modest view about rulership: he emphasises the\nimportance of law, which he sees as the genuine expression of a divine\nmodel, the ruler being only its guardian (see Johannes Stobaeus IV, 5,\n77). Such views can certainly be traced back to Plato: the passages\nabout kingship can be set in parallel with Plato’s account of\nphilosopher-kings in the Republic, whereas those about the\nprimacy of laws obviously recall Plato’s political views in the\nLaws. But parallels are abundant even outside the Platonist\ntradition (e.g., in Stoicism and in Dio Chrysostomus, in the\nPseudo-Pythagorean writings) and the introductory tone of\nIamblichus’ letters makes it difficult to isolate characteristic\nNeoplatonist elements. According to some interpreters, however,\nIamblichus’ interest in politics is likely to be connected to\nhis views about the embodied soul. As O’Meara remarks,  \nHuman soul, alienated from its divine origins, finds its identity in\nits relation to body. As a consequence, the material, bodily aspects\nof the human condition were to be of much greater relevance for the\ndivinization of soul in later Neoplatonism than in Plotinus. (2003:\n39)  \nIn fact, Neoplatonist philosophical ideas shaped not only\nIamblichus’ views about politics, but also those of the Emperor\nJulian, whose Neoplatonist background (ultimately deriving from the\nIamblichean teaching of his masters at Pergamon) informs both his\naccount of law and rulership (see Julian’s Letter to\nThemistius) and his theological foundation of the Roman Empire\n(Elm 2012). \nIn Ennead I, 2, Plotinus holds that virtues bearing the same\nnames (that is the four cardinal virtues of Plato’s\nRepublic: wisdom, temperance, courage and justice) exist in\ndifferent grades at different levels: the lower level is that of the\nso-called civic or political virtues, whereas the higher degrees\ninclude the soul’s purification and the result of it, that is\nthe contemplation of Intellect on the part of the soul. In\nSentence 32, Porphyry draws on Plotinus and offers a\nclassification of virtues: these are divided into civic, purificatory,\ncontemplative and paradigmatic virtues. Iamblichus’ lost\ntreatise On virtues was certainly based on these previous\ndiscussions and offered a systematic discussion that laid the ground\nfor later Neoplatonist accounts of the so-called scala\nvirtutum. The late anonymous Prolegomena to Plato’s\nphilosophy ascribes the distinction of five levels of virtues to\nIamblichus: natural, moral, political, purificatory, and contemplative\n(see Prolegomena § 26.30–36). This distinction is\nconnected to the order or reading of Plato’s dialogues: so the\nGorgias focuses on the political virtues, the Phaedo\non the purificatory. All this is most likely to derive from\nIamblichus, who then associated his canon of twelve Platonic dialogues\nwith the different levels of the scala virtutum (see above,\n Section 2.2).\n While crucial, the testimony of the Prolegomena is\nnonetheless partial: we know from Damascius and Marinus of Neapolis\nthat Iamblichus’ distinction had two further levels at the top:\nthose of “paradigmatic” and “theurgic” or “hieratic” virtues. Iamblichus,\ntherefore, probably distinguished seven levels of virtues: natural,\nmoral, political, purificatory, contemplative, paradigmatic, theurgic\nor hieratic. The views about the soul and theurgy outlined above help\nexplain why Iamblichus, unlike Plotinus and Porphyry, posited theurgic\nor hieratic virtues at the top of his classification: such virtues are\nthe highest degree of the soul’s ascension to the divine, which\nhuman beings cannot achieve merely through their intellect. \nIt is worth noting that the author of the Prolegomena sets\nout the hierarchy of virtues as an order “according to\ndepth” (kata bathos). The term bathos has a\ntechnical meaning in Iamblichus: it is borrowed from mathematics and\nis opposed to platos insofar as it describes the vertical\norder of items in a hierarchy, as opposed to the horizontal one (see\nTaormina in TP-2010: 245). This suggests that Iamblichus arranged his\nclassification of virtues according to the vertical pattern described\nabove, which points to his distinctive account of the hierarchy of\nbeings.","contact.mail":"adrien.lecerf@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
