In a typical assessment of\nPorta’s Magia Naturalis, Wayne Shumaker writes:\n\n Occasionally [Porta] shows that he has actually\nexperimented, as in writing about the lodestone or burning-glasses. On\nthe whole, however, the treatise is backward-looking.  (1972: 120)\n\n\n\nYet philosophy in Porta’s time encompassed a far wider range of\ntopics than it does today, including cosmology, meteorology, and\nphysics; biology and human psychology; and moral philosophy and\npolitics. As a prolific writer on topics then associated with more or\nless alternative currents to Aristotelian natural philosophy (Henry\n2008), Porta became one of the most famous and popular figures in the\nintellectual life of the second half of the sixteenth century and\nbeyond.[1] Porta\nthus ranks amongst the many rather unorthodox praeternatural\nphilosophers in the traditional categories of the peripatetic\ncurriculum. In the rich intellectual ferment that eventually generated\nthe scientific revolution of the following century, Porta constitutes\na highly interesting transitional figure because he engaged with the\nworld of objects, craft and chemical substances. From this\n“scientific underworld” occupied by the “professors\nof secrets” emerged a naturalized concept of human beings and\ninnovative ideas about science (Smith 2009), which Porta amply (and\ncritically) reflects. His impressive number of texts are written in\nvery different literary genres, ranging from learned Latin treatises\nto stage plays—mannerist comedies written in Italian, some of\nwhich resonated widely and seem to have influenced Shakespeare (Clubb\n1964, 2008). The wonders Porta produced onstage and in his laboratory\nhad a decidedly histrionic character, and perhaps this alignment of\ntheatre and nascent science provides one of the more coherent\nperspectives on Porta’s many different intellectual endeavours\n(Kodera 2012).\n\n\nVerso of Frontispiece from G. B. Della Porta, De\nDistillationibus libri IX. Argentorati: Zetzner 1609, courtesy\nUniversitätsbibliothek Wien.\n\n\nThe frontispiece to the De Distillationibus libri IX\n(1609), with Porta’s portrait, gives a good impression of his\nmany divergent scientific interests, ranging from physiognomies,\nastrology, ciphers, and the art of memory to distillation, optics,\nmagnetism, alchemy, cross-breeding and the embellishment of (mostly\nfemale) bodies—as well as practical jokes.\n\nBorn into a noble Neapolitan family in 1535, Porta published\nhis Magiae naturalis libri IIII in 1558. The immediate\nsuccess of this book firmly established Porta’s reputation as a\nlearned magus and professor of secrets in the European world. The book\nsaw sixteen Latin editions; six Italian, seven French and two Dutch\nversions appeared by 1588 alone (Balbiani 2001), although in 1583 the\nbook ended up on the Madrid Index of Prohibited Books due to\nPorta’s naturalistic approach to witchcraft. A second version in\n1589 was enlarged to 20 books and purged of the infamous recipe for\nwitch’s unguent. Due to severe difficulties with ecclesiastical\ncensorship (the Roman Holy Office had begun legal proceedings against\nPorta in the early 1570s), he remained under life-long surveillance by\nthe inquisition (Valente 1997). Early in his life, Porta apparently founded an academy of secrets\ndedicated to the study of natural phenomena. Its members could only be\nappointed if they had discovered a hitherto unknown segreto\n(Badaloni 1959/60). The meetings seem to have been held in\nPorta’s Neapolitan palace. There also exists some intriguing\narchaeological evidence for special subterranean meeting rooms under\nPorta’s villa in Vico Equense, then a village just outside\nNaples (Balbiani 2008). After 1558, Porta travelled widely, stopping\nin Apulia, Calabria, Lombardy, Venice, and Paris. In Spain he seems to\nhave visited the court of Philip II, a renowned patron of alchemy who\nsought miraculous medicines for himself and his family’s\nailments. The Magia Naturalis is, unsurprisingly, dedicated\nto this important patron.  Porta presented Philip II with another book\non ciphers (De furtivis litterarum notis vulgo de ziferis libri\nIV 1563), followed by L'arte del ricordare (1566), a\ntreatise on the art of memory (a Latin version appeared in 1602 under\nthe title Ars reminsicendi). In 1579 and during the following\nyears, Porta was repeatedly invited to Rome by Cardinal Luigi D'Este\n(1538–1586), ostensibly to pursue his research into the secrets\nof nature, but perhaps more importantly to enjoy some protection in\nhis household during his trial before the inquisition. 1580 found\nPorta overseeing the construction of a parabolic mirror in Venice,\nwhere he met Paolo Sarpi (1552–1623). Having sold parts of his Neapolitan palazzo in the\npreceding year, Porta returned to Naples in 1582 and began researching\nthe philosopher’s stone at the behest of Cardinal D'Este. In the\nfollowing two years he published two treaties on agriculture\n(Pomarium 1583, Olivetum 1584) and his richly\nillustrated Humana physiognomia (1584). In 1586 Porta was\nprobably again summoned before the Neapolitan Inquisition, perhaps\ntogether with Luigi Tansillo (1510–1568), an influential poet\n(and a close acquaintance of Giordano Bruno (1548–1600)). Porta\nwas instructed to abstain from publishing on divinatory and magical\narts and write comedies instead.  That same year Porta returned to\nRome under the protection of Cardinal D'Este, who died a couple of\nyears later. In 1588 and back in Naples, Porta published a\nphysiognomony of plants (Phytognomonica) and a translation of\nthe first book of Ptolemy’s Almagest. The following\nyear saw the publication of the second, much enlarged edition of\nthe Magia naturalis and the comedy Olimpia, which\nmay have been staged in the presence of viceroy Don Juan de\nZuñiga (1551–1608). In 1590, Porta met Tommaso Campanella\n(1568–1639); in the next year he published\nthe tragicommedia Penelope, followed in 1592 by the\ncomedy Fantesca as well as Villae, an extensive\naccount of his travels through Europe. The Venetian Inquisition\nprohibited the publication of the Italian version of the Human\nPhysiognomony. The ban was reinforced in 1593, when De\nrefractione, a treatise on optics, came out. In\n1596 Trappolaria—another comedy—was printed. Now\nfamous across all Europe, in 1598 Porta dared to defy the\ninquisitional ban and published Della fisionomia del’\nhuomo under the pseudonym Giovanni de Rosa. For the following\nthree years Porta seems to have kept a deliberately low profile; his\ntragicomedies Fratelli rivali and Cintia came out\nonly in 1601. Porta then had the Latin version of his treatise on the\nart of memory printed, as well as Penumaticorum libri tres\n(on the vacuum and how to lift up liquids) and Curvilinearum\nelementorum libri duo (on optics), two treatises that reappeared\nin enlarged versions as I tre libri spiritali (1606)\nand Elementorum curvilineorum libri tres (1608). In 1603\nPorta outlined a naturalized form of divinatory astrology and\nphysiognomics in the Coelestis physiognomonia. Federico Cesi\n(1585–1630), a young Roman nobleman with a passion for natural\nphilosophy who founded the famous Academia dei Lincei,\nvisited Porta in 1604. Sorella was published in the same\nyear. Between 1606 and 1607 the comedies Astrologo, Turca,\nCarnbonaria and Moro were published. The short\ntreatise De destillatione (1608) became another of\nPorta’s bestsellers, but this success was overshadowed by the\ndeath of Gianvincenzo Porta, his brother and collaborator. De\nmunitione, a treatise on military fortifications and on firearms,\ncame out in 1608; in the following year two comedies (Furiosa\nand Chiappinaria) were published. 1609 also marked the\nbeginning of Porta’s dispute with Galileo Galilei\n(1564–1642) (another famous member of the Academy of the Lynx)\nover who had first invented the telescope. The Lincei\nreopened in 1610, due to the death of Cesi’s father, who had\ndisapproved of Federico’s scientific endeavours; Porta’s\ndiscovery of the telescope was acknowledged by the Academy, and he\nbecame director of its Naples branch (which, however, never opened)\n(Freedberg 2002). The Holy Office prohibited the publication of\nPorta’s treatise on palmistry, De ea naturalis\nphysiognomoniae parte quae ad manuum lineas spectat. In 1611\nPorta opened the academy of the Otiosi, an institution\ndedicated to letters and to science; some of his plays may have been\nstaged there. Porta seems to have worked simultaneously on the\ntelescope and the philosopher’s stone.  These endeavours\nresulted in the draft for his last and largely unfinished work on\n(more or less) natural magic, the Criptologia and\nthe Thaumatologia, which was to be dedicated to Rudolf\nII. (Needless to say, it was never to obtain an imprimatur by\nthe ecclesiastical authorities.) The tragedy Gregorio (1611)\nand, in the following year, the comedy Tabernaria (1612) were\npublished; in 1613 Porta was honored by the Lincei with a\nmedal cast by Francesco Stelluti (1577–1653). Another\ncomedy, Fratelli simili, and the tragedy Ulisse were\npublished in 1614. In February 1615 Porta died in the house of his\ndaughter Cinzia: there are no records of Porta’s wife, whose\nname is unknown (for Porta’s biography in general, see Romei\n1989; Piccari 2007). A large part of Porta’s philosophical speculation is\ncontained in the two versions of his Magia naturalis (1558,\n1589), crystallized in the persona of the natural magus. Porta seeks\nto avoid all religious topics, as well as even the remotest hint of\nceremonial magic; other than in the third book of Heinrich Cornelius\nAgrippa of Nettesheim’s (1486–1535) De occulta\nPhilosophia, for instance, there are no instructions for prayers,\nfasting, or invocations (Klaassen 2013). Porta’s magic is thus\nless a way to improve one’s own mind or to communicate with\ndivine forces, and more a means to manipulate objects and human beings\nwith crafty tricks.  Porta developed this secular approach to magic in\nthe face of ecclesiastical prosecution, for it seems that he was\ncondemned for exercising ceremonial magic (Zambelli\n2007). Porta’s magus is a decidedly male figure who unites the\nphysical dexterity of the trickster, the experience of the alchemist,\nthe erudition of the humanist, the astrologer’s command of\nmathematics, and the intuitive knowledge of the psychic medium in\norder to embody a superhuman, ideal man capable of manipulating\neverything and everybody. The magus must be talented, rich, educated,\nand hard-working; magic is the most noble part of philosophy for Porta\n(Magia 1558: bk. 1, ch. 2).  Instead of a priest or\nmetaphysician in quest of the divine—as in Pico della Mirandola\nor John Dee—(Harkness 1999), Porta’s magus is thus\ndepicted as an artifex (a craftsman or mastermind) who knows\nhow to manipulate the natural and occult properties of certain\nbodies. Here, the attractive power a magnet exercises on iron is taken\nas a paradigm: the speculation is that all bodies have an\ninherent property to attract certain other bodies (Copenhaver 1991,\n2007). According to Porta, these qualities are occult because their\nworkings cannot be grasped by our intellect. Yet he infers that occult\nproperties derive from formal, not material causes—partly\nbecause a very small quantity of matter often may have an enormous\neffect (Magia 1558: bk. 1, ch. 8). Magic is therefore a specific science of natural objects (animals,\nherbs, stones), the servant or minister of nature; in Porta’s\ncharacteristic definition of natural magic, just as a peasant prepares\nthe soil to help nature produce its marvelous effects, so the natural\nmagus prepares matter in a special way to allow its natural (but\nnevertheless occult) properties to appear. Structurally, this magic is\na form of applied Platonist metaphysics—in Ernst\nCassirer’s words, an emanatist form of physics\n(“emanatistische Form der Physik” Cassirer 2002\n[1926]: 128). In reasoning highly reminiscent of Marsilio\nFicino’s (1433–1499) cosmology in the De via coelitus\ncomparanda and the De amore, Porta maintains that in the\nstrict hierarchical order of Creation the transcendent forms are\ndirectly affiliated with God; they are projected into the world in\nvarious manifestations, first into the Angels (or daemons),\nsubsequently into the soul, and ultimately into qualities\n(qualitates) via the elements, again of celestial origin, as\ntheir instruments shape matter (Magia 1558: bk. 1,\nch. 4). Porta’s tacit refusal to acknowledge the Aristotelian border\nbetween sub- and supralunar worlds in cosmology is a salient feature\nin his account of the hierarchy of being. This erosion of boundaries\neasily leads to the assumption that the seemingly erratic movements of\nobjects in the sublunar sphere are actually less random than they\nmight appear, because they are governed by secret, divine\nprinciples. Conversely, the direct causal nexus between divine powers\nand created forms accounts for those objects’ potential to\noperate in seemingly miraculous, but actually natural, ways\n(Magia 1558: bk. 1, ch. 5).  Centrally related are the\ndoctrine of universal animation and the belief that the superior\ncelestial influx is mirrored in material objects; these forces may be\nchanneled at will into inferior creatures on earth. Knowledge of such procedures allows the magician to exercise\nconsiderable power in ordering and disposing bodies to reveal new and\namazing features. Generally, an object’s visible traits, or\nsignatures, are indicative of its occult powers and those\npowers’ relationship to other objects, both higher and lower in\nthe hierarchy of being. This idea is also central to Porta’s\ndoctrine of physiognomonics (discussed below) . All things in the universal hierarchy of being are moved by the\n(irrational) forces of attraction and repulsion they feel for one\nanother. Porta provides an impressive description of the macrocosmic\nanimal, the male and female aspects of which mingle in a harmonious\nand well-coordinated way, which he expeditiously plagiarized\n(Magia 1589: bk. 1, ch. 9; Ficino 1989 [1489]: lib. 3,\nch. 26).  At a deep level—and in a characteristic form of\ncircular reasoning—the cosmology of natural magic thus depends\non the workings of a decidedly erotic cosmology itself modeled on\nhuman forms of sexuality (Kodera 2010). Porta’s magic is parasitically dependent on manipulating the\naffective structures of love and hatred that bind together the\nuniverse. The principle of universal affective correlations formed the\nbackbone of Renaissance natural magic in general. Porta credits this\ndoctrine to Empedocles (Magia 1558: bk.1, ch. 9), who held a\nreputation as a magus amongst Porta’s contemporaries (Kingsley\n1995).  These ideas were not only embraced by many of the\npreternatural philosophers, but were already found in the preface of\nthe De mirabilibus mundi ascribed to Albertus, one of\nPorta’s favorite sources for many of his more\neccentric segreti (such as those mentioned in footnote 1\nof this article). The postulation of an affective structure permeating\nthe whole of creation from top to bottom was vital to account for the\nphenomenon of action at a distance (actio in distans), which\nAristotle had expressly ruled out in his Physics (7. 2,\n244a14–245b5, see Henry 2008). A side effect of this universal\nconnectedness of all things is that the world as a whole becomes\nanimated (Hankins 2007). The magician capitalizes on the natural\nforces of love, hate, attraction and repulsion inherent to the\nuniverse to act as a matchmaker, and he produces marvelous offspring:\nmany of the magus’ activities are akin to husbandry.  (Again,\nthis is an idea also found in Ficino’s De vita).\nPorta’s Magia 1589 (bk. 2 and 3) contains long chapters\non the production of monsters in the vegetable as well as animal\nworlds. A central topic for Porta is various technologies for attaining\nvision of the miraculous. He supplies numerous recipes for drugs and\nmagical lamps designed to distort our perceptions, (Magia\n1589: bk. 8, ch 2), some of which also have a strong theatrical\norientation, including his witches’ unguent, lenses, telescope\nand camera obscura) (Reeves 2008). For the most part, Porta’s\nmirrors were not subjects for speculation, as they had long been in\nmetaphysics, theology, magic and the divinatory arts. Neither were\nthey tools to produce “objective or scientific data”\n(Daston and Galison 2007; Smith 2009). Porta’s experiments with\nlenses and mirrors (such as the improved form of the camera\nobscura) fit more coherently into the perspective described\nabove: these devices function as generators of marvels, with the\nobjective of stirring spectators’ imaginations (Dupré\n2007; Thielemann 2009).  The resulting images take on a form of\nexistence that, like a phantasm, is halfway between “real”\nand “imaginary” (Giglioni 2011). In the next section, we see some of the more inconvenient aspects\nof Porta’s theory of magic discussed here—its circular\nreasoning and anthropomorphism—reappear in Porta’s ideas\non physiognomonics (Simon 1980; Védrine 1986). Physiognomonics, a proto- or pseudo-science on the rise in the\nsixteenth century, sought to identify the visible affinities between\nall physical things. Physiognomonists like Porta detected such\naffinities everywhere, from plants and animals to the bodies and faces\nof humans, and even further up the ontological scale to the appearance\nof the planets. Porta’s physiognomonics provides cartographies\nof the outward appearance of physical bodies aimed at predicting the\nsoul’s hidden inclinations or dispositions (past, present or\nfuture). Porta’s massive effort to map the exterior appearances\nof all animated bodies runs in tandem with the contemporary medical\napproach towards cartographies of human bodies (as well as\nlandscapes), exemplified most notably by Andreas Vesalius\n(1514–64) in his revolutionary anatomical studies. Within its own historical context, physiognomonics was viewed as a\nrational science as good as, or perhaps even better than, the new\nanatomy, since it could be used for universal description and as a\nmeans to identify character traits. In the circular reasoning\ncharacteristic of his theory of magic, Porta’s physiognomonic\nassessments are based on resemblances in external appearance: for\ninstance, men with a dark, Saturnine complexion evocative of dangerous\nanimals are rendered very likely to go to prison (De ea naturalis\nphysiognomoniae parte quae ad manuum lineas spectat ch. 12). This\nexample highlights the aesthetics structuring Porta’s\nphysiognomonics: beautiful bodies are also morally good. There is a\ndirect association between beauty, virtue, success and health, as\nthese traits all originate from a good temperament, that is, from a\nharmonious mixture of the elements. A monstrous body, on the other\nhand, indicates ill health, bad luck, and dubious moral\ninclinations. A truly universal science, physiognomonics provides its master not\nonly with a key for decoding the ciphers written into human faces (by\nrelating them to the shapes of animals) or a manual for reading the\nlines engraved into the palms of our hands, but also (as Porta\nsuggests) with diagnostic methods for understanding all of creation,\nfrom plants to stars. In this manner, physiognomonics may be described\nas the art that establishes a metonymic relationship between inorganic\nbodies and psychological qualities (Caputo 1990). One important aspect of Porta’s physiognomonics is that it is\nnot merely descriptive: bodies may be mapped and their future\npredicted, but they are nevertheless in a constant state of flux,\ntransition, or mutability. Their essences are not exclusively\ndetermined by an invisible substantial form (soul) derived from\nunchangeable forms—and, in the case of human beings,\nimmortal—as in previous traditions, but (more than ever) result\nfrom external circumstances. These environmental influences are\ndecisive for the fate of individuals whose expressions and appearances\nare unstably shaped. A characteristic quotation illustrates\nPorta’s understanding of physiognomonics: \nThrough this art, we have helped many friends avoid dangers and ascend\nto honours. Shortly before I wrote these things, I counselled a friend\nof mine to avoid the company of a certain ugly and unlucky man, an\nadvice he did not want to hear, as his acquaintance had promised him\nriches; at the end of the day, they were caught by the governor\nproducing counterfeit money in a hide-out and shortly afterwards both\nended on the gallows. (Coelestis physiognomonia, bk. 1, ch.\n2) It has often been noted that Porta opens perspectives on the\nsinister tradition of eugenics, not uncommon currency in European\nintellectual culture since its articulation in\nPlato’s Timaeus (90), where a handsome body is\nstipulated as the abode of a beautiful soul. Apart from the elemental\ninfluences altering body and mind, which can be reduced to qualities\nperceived through touch (such as hot/cold, dry/moist), Porta mentions\nnutrition, climate, and age as determinants of an individual’s\nmental and physical shape.  Disease may also alter an\nindividual’s mental disposition: as an example, Porta mentions\nfevers—since they dry up the brain, they may cause the patient\nto become more intelligent. Disease may even instill a capacity for\ndivination. Alterations in outward appearance bear significant\nconsequences for an individual’s behaviour and habits. (De\nhumana pysiognomonia bk. 6, ch.1) From the perspective of religious orthodoxy, the crucial question\nPorta addresses only with (well-advised) trepidation is whether a\nchange in exterior form can also cause alterations to the\nsoul—i.e., in the substantial and indelible form of humans\n(De humana pysiognomonia bk. 1, ch. 20). Here, Porta takes\nthe position, more common to medical physiologists, that it is a\nphysician’s intervention rather than moral philosophy that cures\nour bodies and minds. On this view, the body becomes a potential stage\nfor medical intervention into the mental realm (Kodera 2010:\nch. 8). According to classical medicine, diseases are caused by an\nimbalance between body fluids—the temperaments. The concept of\nthe temperaments or humoural mixtures in the human body was originally\ndeveloped to describe physiological body states:  The four humours were real body fluids, to which\nlargely hypothetical origins, sites and functions were\nascribed. (Siraisi 1990: 105)\n \nIn late Antiquity and in the Middle Ages, the temperaments were\nunderstood to fall under the reign of the stars, which influence the\ngeneration and corruption of bodies in the sublunar sphere. In an\nimportant conceptual step, Porta turns the tables, contending that\nrather than being controlled by the stars, the medical humours are\nactually universal descriptors structuring the entire cosmos. With\nthis move in a naturalistic direction, Porta strove to eclipse the\nastrological elements of his theory. Even though in the Coelestis\nphysiognomonia he had declared astrology a vain discipline, Porta\nadded an important qualification to this dismissal: astrology is an\nerroneous art, but only as long as divination from the stars is not\nbased on the perceptible features of heavenly bodies. Hence,\na fine physiognomonist will swiftly derive the relevant temperamental\nfeatures from the visible appearance of the planets. In this\nway, all natural bodies remain substantiae signatae,\ncosmically predisposed substances bearing inscriptions of universal\nsigns. The astrological system of categorization was restricted to the\nmedical temperaments, thus associating celestial bodies with a system\nof signs that pertained to medicine and hence to a lower level in the\nhierarchy of being. Instead of governing the lower bodies, the stars\nbecome subject to the same laws as earthly bodies (Coelestis\nphysiognomonia, proemium). In following the Neoplatonic\ncosmology outlined above, the attendant levelling of celestial\nhierarchies constitutes a break with Peripatetic cosmologies. Initially, Porta’s naturalized version of astrology was\nprobably a mere maneuver for detouring around the ecclesiastical\ncensorship on the divinatory arts; in the first edition of\nthe Magia (1558) Porta had fully embraced astrological\ncausation, as well as the decisive role of an auspicious astrological\nmoment for magical operations, especially the confection of talismans\nas described by Ficino in the De vita. (Magia 1558:\nbk. 1, chs. 15–17; Trabucco 2002, 2005). However, close\nalignment of astrology with medical humours and physiognomonics is\nwell in accordance with Porta’s larger aim of naturalizing the\nentire cosmos. In his circular reasoning, Porta’s cosmos becomes\nmore and more anthropomorphic, as universal signatures are imprinted\nnot only into human beings, but also share these physical traits with\nthe stars, animals, herbs and even stones (as explained in\nPorta’s Phytognomonica). Renaissance cryptographers in general had a penchant for mystery\nand the preternatural, as evident from Johannes\nTrithemius’ Steganography, for example. Trithemius, the\nAbbot of Sponheim, got in trouble with his ecclesiastical censors\nbecause he used a complex numerological series of demons’ names,\narranged on Lullian wheels, for encryption (Arnold 1991). With their\naura of mystery, ciphers qualified as a congenial topic for\nPorta’s general outlook as a peddler of marvels. The art of\ncryptography had the advantage of being perhaps less wicked than\nnecromancy, while still attracting the attention of powerful political\npatrons. For someone aspiring to be the adviser and\nprotégé of one of the more powerful worldly rulers, it\nwas therefore a not unwise choice to write such a book. Moreover, Porta considered himself a master physiognomonist endowed\nwith a special talent to read the universal language inscribed on all\nbodies. When seen in the context of the doctrine of universal\nsignatures, it comes as no surprise that Porta also wrote a book on\nciphers: he also believed himself endowed with a special ingenuity for\ndecoding all forms of texts. De furtivis litterarum\nnotis is apparently the first text on this topic that not only\nexplained various ways to encrypt messages, but also gave detailed\ninstructions on how to decipher coded messages (Strasser 2008). In order to organize the memory, Porta recommends constructing a\nmental picture gallery populated with striking images of persons or\ngroups of persons. He also mentions the important role of contemporary\npaintings and sculptures by the foremost artists of his time,\nincluding Titian, Rafael and Michelangelo. Porta maintains that\nrestoring the memory is like refreshing the colors of a faded\npainting. Porta’s approach to the ancient art of memory is\nmarkedly iconic (rather than architectural), as typical for many\nmedieval and early modern formulations of mnemonics (Bolzoni 2001). Especially in\nthe Italian Arte del ricordare, Porta recommends graphic\nerotic fantasy, such as sodomitic intercourse, as the strongest memory\naid; to illustrate his point, he gives examples from\nOvid’s Metamorphoses and from Apuleius. In a manner\nclearly reminiscent not only of his recipes with hallucinogenic drugs\nbut of his naturalist approach in general, Porta maintains that such\nerotic images—phantasmata—are so potent that they may even\nbe able to destroy the memory. In most encyclopedias over the centuries, Giovan Battista Porta is\nremembered for particular inventions—for instance, the telescope\n(Reeves 2008; Saito 2011; Balbiani 2008). This tendency to\ndecontextualize Porta’s (vast) oeuvre by treating it as a quarry\nof ideas actually dates back to his contemporaries: scholars and\ntheologians as varied in temperament and intellectual inclination as\nFrancis Bacon (1561–1626) and Athansius Kircher,\nS.J. (1602–1680) knowingly plagiarized\nPorta’s segreti, whether to show how to improve the\nhuman condition through the systematic investigation of nature or to\ndemonstrate God’s wondrous omnipotence in nature (Vermeir 2012).\nWilliam Gilbert (1544–1603) felt it necessary to take issue with\nthe animistic theories that Porta used to explain magnetism (Kodera\n2014), and Tommaso Campanella (at that time still a faithful disciple\nof Bernardino Telesio(1508/9–1588)) had already deplored\nPorta’s lack of method, which precluded the development of a new\nmetaphysics of nature (Eamon 1995). His many difficulties with the\ninquisition—censors disapproved of his works on divinatory arts\nsuch as physiognomonics, the art of predicting character traits from\nthe faces of humans—were compounded by the distrust of more\northodox intellectuals such as Jean Bodin (1529/30–1596), who\nwould have loved to see Porta burn at the stake for naturalizing the\nWitches’ Sabbath (like Girolamo Cardano (1501–1576), Porta\nhad divulged a recipe for the infamous witch’s unguent)\n(Magia 1558: lib.2, ch. 26; Ernst 1991; Balbiani 2001). Porta\nreacted to these challenges by attempting to abstain from metaphysical\nspeculation and theology; there is good reason to believe that\nPorta’s naturalist stance was actually a consequence of\necclesiastical persecution (Trabucco 2002, 2005). Accordingly, he\ndeveloped a strictly natural magic—natural in the sense that the\nformal principles driving the movement of things in the cosmos were\ntaken as “occult”, with many causes of their often\nmarvelous properties per se unknowable to us. Porta’s\nexperiments thus prudently sought to eclipse all hint of religious\ntopics, including God, the soul, and demons. By eliding discussion of the metaphysical and religious\nimplications of his experiments, Porta tends to direct attention to\nthe physical preconditions and occult, yet natural, qualities that\nallow for spectacular manifestations of portentous qualities in\nphysical bodies, whether human, animal or\nvegetable.[2] The\ninfamous recipe for an unguent employed by witches is a good example\nof Porta’s approach: the nocturnal flights and orgiastic\nencounters with demons and the devil that represent witchcraft’s\nstock in trade are, according to Porta, in fact mere hallucinations\ncaused by belladonna—a material substance with occult, but\nnon-demonic properties (Balbiani 2001). This explanation rests on the\nextent to which the human soul is affected by the occult properties of\nnatural substances. Like Pietro Pomponazzi (1462–1525), who with\nhis De incantationibus had sought to naturalize all\nmiracles, Porta seeks to bypass the question of “proper”\nmiracles produced by divine intercession. Yet and in contrast to\nPomponazzi, who sought to eliminate as much as he could of the\npreternatural, Porta continued to believe fervently in occult\nsympathies and, up to his last unpublished works such as\nthe Thaumaturgia, tried to preserve as much of the\nNeoplatonic magical tradition as possible. For Porta, the visible and\nperceptible qualities of certain material dispositions become embodied\nsigns of a larger and ultimately divine cosmic order to which all\nnatural bodies, including human beings, are subject. Porta’s account thus has the marked and unorthodox tendency\nto eclipse human agency aside from the figure of the natural magus,\nwho by dint of his natural talent, erudition, and wealth is in a\nposition to manipulate and command the natural properties of many\nsubstances and objects. Porta himself cultivated an image of being far\nkeener on staging marvellous experiments or divulging (more or less\ncredible) secrets than on investigating, say, theoretical foundations\nof natural causation. His approach geared to the naturalization of the\nhuman being—body and mind—is perhaps the most suitable\nfocus for studying his thought; here his ideas can be linked not only\nto contemporaries of his such as Giordano Bruno but also to the\ntradition of libertine philosophers leading up to Marquis de Sade\n(1740–1814). When measured against the sophisticated metaphysical backdrop of\nNeoplatonic Renaissance magic, Porta’s theoretical approach\nappears disappointingly simple and rather epigonic—or, as\nBorelli (2014) has argued, unsystematic and thereby unfettered by\ndoctrinal ballast and open to innovation. Upon closer scrutiny, a very\ncomplex picture emerges. When one considers Porta’s numerous\nliterary and scientific texts, he must be ranked among a highly\ninfluential group of philosophers/scientists/magicians including\nMarsilio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494),\nPietro Pomponazzi, and Agrippa von Nettesheim (see Agrippa\n1991). Under shifting historical circumstances and in various ways,\nthese “preternatural philosophers” shared a deep interest\nin the marvelous and the demonic arts. Within this tradition, Porta was a relative latecomer; he dedicated\nhis endeavor to a “sublime science” that catered to a\ncourtly environment increasingly subject to absolutist leadership\n(Daston and Park 1998). Indeed, Porta managed to attract the attention\nof the most powerful patrons in the occult arts and alchemy, among\nthem Emperor Rudolph II and Philip II of Spain. When seen in their\nproper historical context, Porta’s literary and scientific\nactivities appear as a particular form of self-fashioning for the\nemerging class of courtiers under absolutist rulers (Greenblatt 1980;\nBiagioli 1991; MacDonald 2005). Hence, viewing Porta’s oeuvre as\na product of this courtly environment helps us understand his\ncontribution to a characteristic form of comportment, where the\npractice of deception and dissimulation is tied to the crafty staging\nof marvellous appearances (Snyder 2009; Kodera 2012). This topic of the marvellous (meraviglia), and of emotions\nelicited by attendant stupefaction, is so essential for Porta that he\nprojects it onto the whole of creation, thus endowing it with the\nstatus of a universal law. In a crucial passage from\nthe Magia 1558, he writes that Nature herself—the great\nfemale magician—creates all her wonders out of delight in her\nown shows (bk. 1, ch. 9). Both this anthropomorphic perception of nature and the importance\naccorded to marveling in it reveal the close affinity between\nPorta’s magical practices and his texts for the stage. Porta\nevidences a keen sense for media’s power to manipulate\nindividuals and masses alike by way of drugs or optical deceptions,\nwondrous performances, and the employment of the physical traits of\nindividual human beings. He believed that our physiognomonic features,\nthe shapes of our bodies, are indicative of hidden inclinations (for\nthis reason, a master physiognomonist may speedily detect criminals\nand other abject persons). Hence, throughout Porta’s oeuvre we\ncan detect the link he establishes between policing, naturalizing and\nassimilating human beings among other animals, all under the sway of\noccult but natural astrological influences. With his works on\nphysiognomony, Porta undoubtedly sought to offer his services to\nabsolutist rulers and courtiers. This approach distinguishes Porta\nfrom his predecessors: Ficino had directed his intellectual energies\ntowards the development of a Theologia Platonica, i.e., a\nspiritual culture in which the Platonic tradition would be compatible\nwith Christianity, to which end Ficino translated and wrote\ncommentaries on Plato and the Neoplatonists. Ficino developed the\nprinciples for a kind of natural magic directed not at impressing\naudiences, but rather at the amelioration of elderly scholars’\nmelancholy temperaments (Copenhaver 2007).
