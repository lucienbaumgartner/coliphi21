This development is fascinating but extraordinarily\ncomplex.  Scholars are just beginning to take note of the major\ndifferences in the understanding of categories and of how these\ndifferences are related to the discussion of other major philosophical\ntopics in the Middle Ages. Much work remains to be done, even\nregarding the views of towering figures, so necessarily we have had to\nrestrict our discussion to only a few major figures and topics. Still,\nwe hope that the discussion will serve as a good starting point for\nanyone interested in category theory and its history.\n\n\n\nPhilosophers speak about categories in many different ways. There is\none initial, and rather substantial, difference between philosophers\nwho allow a very large number of categories and those who allow only a\nvery small number. The first include among categories such different\nthings as human, green, animal, thought, and justice; the second speak\nonly of very general things such as substance, quality, relation, and\nthe like, as categories. Among twentieth-century authors who allow\nmany categories is Gilbert Ryle (b. 1900, d. 1976). Roderick Chisholm\n(b. 1916, d. 1999) is an example of those who have only very\nfew. Medieval authors follow Aristotle's narrow\nunderstanding. \n\nThe disagreement concerning categories in the history of philosophy\ndoes not end there. Even if we restrict the discussion to a small\nnumber of items of the sort that Aristotle regards as categories, many\nissues remain to be settled about them, and philosophers frequently\ndisagree about how to settle them. These issues may be gathered into\nroughly ten groups. \n\nThe first group comprises what may be described roughly as extensional\nissues; they have to do with the number of categories. The extension\nof a term is comprised by the things of which the term can be\ntruthfully predicated. Thus the extension of ‘cat’\nconsists of all the animals of which it is true to say that they are\ncats.  Philosophers in general frequently disagree on how many\ncategories there are. For example, Aristotle lists up to ten, but\ngives the impression that the ultimate number is not settled at\nall. Plotinus (204/5–270) and Baruch Spinoza (1632–77)\nreduce the number radically, but their views do not by any means\nestablish themselves as definitive.  In the Middle Ages the number of\ncategories is always small (ten or less) but it nonetheless\nvaries. \n\nThe second group is roughly intensional; they concern what categories\nare and the properties they have. The intension of a term is the set\nof properties that apply to the things of which the term is truthfully\npredicated and which are listed in its definition or taken to be\nimplied by it. Thus the intension of ‘human’ is, say,\nrational animal, and includes living and corporeal. Again,\nphilosophers disagree as to whether categories can be defined, and if\nthey can be, how they are to be defined. In general, medieval authors\nreject the possibility of defining them for various reasons.  One\nreason is that most of these authors conceive categories as divisions\nof being, and being for them is not a genus. Since a definition\nrequires a genus (“animal” in the definition of\n“human” given earlier), the categories cannot be defined.\nAnother reason is that a definition requires a difference that\ndistinguishes what is being defined from other types of thing within\nthe genus (“rationality” for humans, within the genus\n“animal”), but the categories are the highest kind of\nthings, so there is nothing outside of them that can be used to\ndistinguish them. \n\nThe third group is ontological; the issues here involve the place that\ncategories occupy in the map of all things that exist or can\nexist. Ontology is the sub-discipline of philosophy that deals with\nbeing and what exists. The three most common questions raised in this\ncontext are: (1) Are categories extra-mental entities, such as\nproperties, qualities, relations, structures, sets, classes, or forms?\n(2) Are categories intra-mental entities, such as phenomena, mental\nacts, mental contents, Gestalten, or mental structures? (3)\nAre categories linguistic entities, such as meanings, words, types,\ntokens, predicates, or syntactical places? Four views stand out.\nAccording to one, categories are linguistic entities–call them\nwords–such as the words ‘quality’ and\n‘relation,’ with which we speak about things. According to\nanother, categories are mental acts–call them\nconcepts–such as the concept of quality or the concept of\nrelation, with which we think about things. Categories are also\nthought to be extra-mental features that things about which we think\nand speak have–call them properties–such as the properties\nof being a quality or of being a relation. Finally, there is an\ninclusive view that tries to integrate all of these three positions\ninto one, arguing that categories are words, concepts, and properties\nbut in different ways.  These four views are not the only choices\navailable (see Gracia 1999), but they are the most popular views\nconsidered in the Middle Ages. \n\nThe fourth group has to do with causes; they include questions about\nhow categories are established or brought about. These issues have\nattracted considerable attention in recent years, particularly among\npost-modern philosophers, such as Michel Foucault (1926–84). In\nthe Middle Ages the way this question is posed depends heavily on the\nontological status accorded to categories, particularly on whether\nthey are mental or extra-mental entities. The Foucauldian concern with\n“social construction,” however, seems to be absent from\nmedieval discussions. \n\nThe fifth group involves epistemology; they concern primarily how we\nhave access to categories, that is, how we get to know them and under\nwhat conditions. Although this is not a widespread topic of discussion\nin the Early Middle Ages, later on there are various attempts to\ndetermine the number and identity of the categories and the basis on\nwhich this determination can be carried out. These attempts, and the\nassumptions which guide them, are closely related to an important\nissue for the Middle Ages in general that becomes critical toward its\nend: the relation of language, thought, and reality, or as it is also\nput, between signifying, thinking, and being, or between words,\nconcepts, and things. Some think the relation is isomorphic, whereas\nothers disagree. \n\nThe sixth group concerns language; they involve the terms used to talk\nabout categories and the way they function. These issues are\nparticularly relevant for the view that considers categories to be\nlinguistic entities, and therefore become central in twentieth-century\nAnglo-American philosophy. In the Middle Ages, they are especially\nimportant in the latter part of the period when issues of language\ntake center stage in philosophical discussions. \n\nThe seventh group falls within the philosophy of mind; they have to do\nwith the status of categories in the mind. Since we think about\ncategories and through categories, it is pertinent for a philosopher\nto ask questions of this sort. This topic is particularly pertinent\nfor those who think that categories are mental entities. In the\nMiddle Ages, the questions raised about the status of categories in\nthe mind are put generally in the context of other topics, such as the\nstatus of universals, but much of what medieval authors say about\nuniversals can be applied, mutatis mutandis, to\ncategories. \n\nThe eighth group may be characterized as social, political, and\naxiological; they have to do with the value and use of categories by\npersons, society, and the polity. Many contemporary philosophers have\nfound in this topic a way of undermining some traditional views of the\nworld that they consider oppressive or inaccurate. These issues do not\nseem to be explicitly raised in the Middle Ages and may indicate one\nimportant difference between medieval and contemporary philosophical\nthought. \n\nThe ninth group is meta-disciplinary; they involve the discipline that\nstudies categories. Obviously, how these issues are addressed depends\nto a great extent on the position one takes concerning the conception\nand ontological status of categories, as well as on how the various\ndisciplines of learning are understood. This is a topic of concern in\nthe Middle Ages, and is explicitly addressed by late medieval\nauthors. They identify various disciplines as the place to study\ncategories, ranging from grammar and logic to metaphysics. \n\nFinally, rather than discussing categories in general, one may deal\nwith particular categories, such as substance or relation. This is\nperhaps the most frequent way in which categories are discussed in the\nhistory of philosophy, including the Middle Ages. \n\nApart from these topics, there are others that are closely related to\ncategories and often discussed together with them. One involves\ntrans-categorial terms, such as ‘being,’\n‘one,’ ‘true,’ and ‘good,’ which\napply to all categories and are predicable of every term that falls\nwithin the categories. In the Middle Ages, these are known as\n“the transcendentals” and their status becomes\ncontroversial in the thirteenth century (see Gracia 1992b). \n\nA second topic concerns what are known as\n“ante-predicaments,” and are introduced by Aristotle at\nthe beginning of Categories: univocity, equivocity, and\ndenomination. Univocity occurs when the same term is predicated in the\nsame sense, as ‘animal’ is of a man and an ox. Equivocity\nis dived into random equivocity and purposeful equivocity.  The former\noccurs when the same term is predicated in different senses, as\n‘animal’ is of a person and a picture of a person. The\nlatter involves the broader issues of analogical predication.And\ndenomination occurs when the predicated term is derived from another,\nas ‘grammarian’ is from ‘grammar’ (see\nAshworth 1991). \n\nA third topic involves the “post-predicaments,” a cluster\nof seemingly disparate notions treated by Aristotle in\nCategories after he discusses the categories proper. They\ninclude opposites (relatives, contraries, privation and possession,\nand affirmation and negation), priority (in time, in existence, in\norder, and in value) and simultaneity (in time and by nature), change\n(generation and corruption, increase and decrease, alteration and\nlocomotion), and several meanings of ‘having.’ \n\nA fourth topic, also commonly discussed beginning in the thirteenth\ncentury, concerns what becomes known as “syncategorematic\nterms.” These are particles, such as ‘every’ and\n‘and,’ which are not classifiable into any category (see\nWilliam of Sherwood 1968). \n\nA fifth topic of discussion introduced in the Middle Ages through\nBoethius' Commentaries on Porphyry's Isagoge involves the\n“predicables” (praedicabilia), which are ways in\nwhich predicates relate to subjects. Examples are\n“accident” (‘black’ in ‘This cat is\nblack’), “species” (‘man’ in\n‘Socrates is a man’), and “definition”\n(‘rational animal’ in ‘Man is a rational\nanimal’) (see Porphyry 1975). Although these issues are\noriginally introduced by Aristotle in the Topics, this work\nwas not available in the Middle Ages until after the period of\ntranslations in the twelfth century. \n\nBecause of considerations of space, we shall not discuss these related\ntopics here, nor can we refer to all the issues about categories\nraised by medieval authors or mentioned above. However, the conceptual\nframework of issues we have introduced should help in the\nunderstanding of how categories are approached in the Middle Ages and\nthe differences between the medieval approach and those taken in other\nperiods of the history of philosophy. We begin with the classical\nbackground of the discussion of categories in the Middle Ages. This\nconsists primarily of Aristotle, who is responsible for the first\ntreatise on categories ever written. \n\nThe philosophical discussion of categories begins with Aristotle\n(B.C.E. 384–322). His view is difficult to interpret, even though\nthe texts dealing with this topic (Categories, Topics\nI, and Metaphysics V) are characteristically direct\nin style. Still, there is some consensus among scholars that Aristotle\nproposes three ways of understanding categories: as realities,\nconcepts, and linguistic terms. Much of the subsequent philosophical\ndiscussion of categories concerns the correctness of this view. Some\nfavor a position according to which categories are realities, which\nare then said to be reflected in thought and language; some endorse a\nview of them merely as concepts, which are also said to be reflected\nin language; some maintain that categories are merely linguistic\nterms, and reject any implication that they are real entities or\nconcepts; and still others maintain an inclusive view that contends\nthat categories are all three: words, concepts, and extra-mental\nentities. \n\nThe Greek term that Aristotle uses for category means predicate\n(categoria) so that categories would appear to be\nkinds of predicates, the most general kinds of predicates. However,\nsome commentators claim that Aristotle uses the term rather for kinds\nof predication and kinds of beings (for example in Topics\n103b20–27, and Metaphysics 1017a22–27; see Frede\n1987, 29–48). In Categories, Aristotle uses the term\ntechnically to refer to substance, quantity,\nquality, relation, place, time,\nposition, state, action, and\naffection (9a27, 11b37, 11b7), although he also speaks of\nless general terms, such as ‘white,’ ‘half,’\nand ‘last year,’ and trans-categorial terms such as\n‘good’ and ‘unity.’ Aristotle's\ncategories are not, strictly speaking, the predicates we use when we\nspeak in ordinary language; rather, they are the most general kinds of\npredicates, or predications. Thus ‘white’ and\n‘here’ do not refer to categories, but\n‘quality’ and ‘place’ do. The Aristotelian\ncategories may be taken as the most general predicates which can be\npredicated or, alternatively, they are the most general kinds of\npredication into which the predicates we use in ordinary discourse may\nbe classified. They provide answers to direct questions such as when,\nwhere, how, what, and so on. Terms that extend to more than one\ncategory (e.g., ‘good’), or do not apply to categories\n(e.g., ‘and’) are treated separately. \n\nPredicability, then, is not a sufficient condition of categoricity,\nbut non-predicability is a sufficient disqualification. For Aristotle,\nthe individual is not, strictly speaking, predicable, although there\nare places in which he speaks of the individual as\npredicable. Examples of individuals are this horse and a\ncertain point of grammar present in the knower (1b5). The first\nis what Aristotle calls a primary substance, which he defines\nin Categories as that which is neither predicable of, nor\npresent in, a subject (2a11). The second is, like a primary substance,\nnon-predicable, but it can be present in a subject. Both are\nindividual and neither is predicable. \n\nThat Aristotle refers to categories with the Greek term which\ncorresponds roughly to the term ‘predicate’ in English\ndoes not mean that he understood categories to be merely linguistic\nterms.  Indeed, ‘predicate’ itself is used in a variety of\nways by philosophers. Some think of predicates as properties of some\nkind, some as concepts, some as words, and so on. Therefore, to say\nthat something is a predicate does not necessarily mean that it is a\nlinguistic term.  In the case of Aristotle, there is ample evidence in\nCategories itself which suggests that categories are not just\nlinguistic terms that reflect the fundamental ways in which we speak\nabout things, but also ways in which things are. The interpretative\ntradition that favors a linguistic or logical understanding of the\ncategories goes back at least to Porphyry (1887, 56), who tries to\nreconcile what he takes to be Aristotle's linguistic/logical position\nwith Plato's metaphysics (Ebbesen 1990). Consider for example how\nAristotle introduces the categories: “Of things said without any\ncombination, each signifies either a substance or quantity or\nqualification or a relative or where or when or being-in-a-position or\nhaving or doing or being-affected” (1b25). Clearly, he is\ntalking about language when he says, “Of things said\nwithout combination, each signifies….” for\nthings that are said and that signify are linguistic terms\n(Poetics 1456b38ff; our emphasis). The linguistic emphasis is\nreinforced elsewhere, when he adds that “of things which are\nsaid without any combination none is either true or\nfalse…” (2a9). \n\nAt the same time, these statements do not imply that what is signified\nnecessarily has to be linguistic. Indeed, earlier in\nCategories, Aristotle unabashedly mixes the language of\n“language” with the language of “being” when\nhe notes: “Of things that are: some are said\nof a subject but are not in any subject. For example, man is\nsaid of a subject, the individual man, but is not in any\nsubject” (1a20; our emphasis). This text begins with a reference\nto things that are (ta onta), but goes on to speak about\nthings that are said (ta legomena). The same occurs in other\nplaces (2a11). In a text from Metaphysics (1017a23–25),\nthe isomorphism between being and language is openly expressed. \n\nAristotle is less explicit about the understanding of categories as\nconcepts. In Categories generally he does not speak about how\nthings are conceived; rather, he speaks about how things are\ncalled or how they are. At the same time, from what\nhe says elsewhere about signification and the way we think, it is not\nunreasonable to surmise that he also thinks of categories as concepts\nof some kind. For example, at the beginning of On\nInterpretation, he claims that “spoken sounds are symbols\nof affections [or concepts] in the soul, and written marks symbols of\nspoken sounds. And just as written marks are not the same for all men,\nneither are spoken sounds. But what these are in the first place\nsounds of–affections of the soul–are the same for all; and\nwhat these affections are likenesses of–actual things–are\nalso the same” (16a 4–8). \n\nNone of this, however, is very clear. Indeed, Aristotle never actually\nsays that categories are words, concepts, or realities; he only speaks\nof them as categories, that is, predicates. But\n‘predicate’ can be used to mean realities, concepts, or\nlinguistic terms. Aristotle does speak of categories as if\nthey were realities or linguistic terms, and one can further infer\nthat he could have spoken of them as if they were\nconcepts. But this does not definitely clarify what he thinks about\nthem. Indeed, on the basis of what he says we cannot determine for\nsure that he even raises the question of the ultimate ontological\nstatus of categories.  The situation is further obscured because\nAristotle never identifies the discipline where categories are\nsupposed to be studied and he treats them in both logical\n(Categories, Topics) and metaphysical\n(Metaphysics) contexts. \n\nOne more point needs to be made clear. Aristotle never clearly and\nconsistently ties the categories to sentential or propositional\nstructure. In Categories he appears to consider them in\nisolation from their syntactical context, but in Topics\n(103b20–27) and Metaphysics (1017a23–25) he seems\nto tie them to predication and, thus, to consider them in relation to\na syntactical context. This ambiguity gives rise to different\ninterpretations, such as that of Frede, who considers them to be kinds\nof predications (1987), and that of Ryle, who views them as\nindependent from syntactical context (1971). In short, the picture is\nfar from clear, and this serves to separate Aristotle from authors who\nexplicitly and exclusively view categories as reflecting syntactical\ncontexts. \n\nThe same ambiguity with respect to the ontological status of\ncategories that we find in Aristotle is found in many of his medieval\ncommentators. Perhaps this can be taken as a sign that they believe\ncategories to be realities, concepts, and linguistic terms, that is,\nthat categories are ways in which the world is, ways in which we think\nabout the world, and ways in which we speak about the world. However,\nthere are some who argue for purely linguistic or conceptual ways of\nunderstanding categories. In modern philosophy, the emphasis shifts\ntoward the language of thought, a prime example of which is Immanuel\nKant (1724–1804; see Gracia 2000). \n\nLong before the Middle Ages, a well-defined tradition of writing\ncommentaries on philosophical works had been established. It is\nperhaps natural, then, that the most common way of engaging philosophy\nthroughout the Middle Ages consisted in writing commentaries on what\nwere considered authoritative philosophical texts, and particularly\nworks by Aristotle. So popular was commentary writing that thousands\nof Medieval Latin commentaries on Aristotle's writings are still\nextant, of which nearly two hundred concern the Categories\n(Lohr 1967, 1968, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973). These commentaries were not\nalways intended simply to explain texts; often, they became the means\nof developing the thoughts of the commentators on various\nphilosophical topics. Moreover, commentators did not comment on\nAristotle's works in isolation, but also consulted other commentaries\non the same texts. In this way, they engaged and often challenged\nother interpretations, and developed their own insights. \n\nAt the beginning of the sixth century, we find several late\nNeoplatonic philosophers who continue the ancient tradition of\ncommentary writing. They include Boethius, Philoponus, Elias, David,\npseudo-Elias, Stephanus, and Simplicius. Two of these in particular\ndeserve mention. Simplicius (490–560) is important because his\nCommentary was translated into Latin by William of Moerbeke in 1266\nand was subsequently read by Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and Ockham, among\nothers, though apparently not by Albertus Magnus. In addition,\nSimplicius attempted to prove that there are ten and only ten\ncategories, something that became the subject of dispute in the later\nMiddle Ages. \n\nBoethius (ca. 480–524/5) is important because he sought to\npreserve Greek philosophy by translating all of the works of Plato and\nAristotle into Latin. Unfortunately, his untimely death prevented him\nfrom accomplishing his ambitious goal, though he did succeed in\ntranslating Aristotle's Categories, On Interpretation, Prior\nAnalytics, and Porphyry's Isagoge. Moreover, Boethius\nhad hoped to write two commentaries on many of Aristotle's works: an\nintroductory commentary for students of philosophy and an advanced\ncommentary for philosophers. But again, his early death prevented him\nfrom producing second commentaries. Like other Neoplatonic\ncommentaries, Boethius' work draws heavily from Porphyry and\nperpetuates the view of the categories which became the canonical\ninterpretation of Aristotle's text, i.e., that it is a work about\nvocal signs that signify things (Boethius 1847, 160 a-b). \n\nDue to the closure of the Academy in 529 and the dominance of the\nLatin language in the West to the virtual exclusion of Greek, little\nof the ancient commentary tradition exerted any influence on the Latin\nMiddle Ages. Thus, in spite of the many commentaries produced in the\nancient world, the main texts available to authors dealing with\ncategories after the sixth century were Boethius' translation of and\nCommentary on Aristotle's Categories, the Categoriae\ndecem (a Themistian paraphrase of Aristotle's Categories\ntraditionally attributed to St. Augustine), and a composite\ntranslation which included the lemmata of Boethius' Commentary and\nsome glosses. A few other works refer to categories, such as\nPorphyry's Isagoge, translated and commented on twice by\nBoethius, and Boethius' two Commentaries on On Interpretation\nand his treatise On the Trinity. However, the\ngrowing interest in logic that began in the ninth century and then was\nrevived in the eleventh century made Boethius' translation and\nCommentary on the Categories the center of attention on this\ntopic. From the sixth to the ninth century, most commentaries on the\nCategories were written in Syriac.  These include commentaries by Paul\nthe Persian (fl. 550), Sergius of Reš‘aina (d. 536), Aba\nof Kashkar (fl. c. 600), Silvanus of Qardu (early seventh century),\nAthanasius of Balad (d. 687), Jacob of Edessa (d. 708), George of the\nArabs (d. 724), Theodore bar Koni (late eighth century), David bar\nPaul (fl. 785), Mošē bar Kēphā (d. 903), and by\nHunayn ibn Ishāq.  The last Commentary, in turn, appears to be\nthe source for the Arabic tradition (see King 2011). \n\nBeginning in the tenth century, Islamic philosophers\nsuch as Alfarabi (ca. 870–950), Avicenna (980–1037), and\nAverroes (ca.  1126–98), produced commentaries, but their impact\nin the West was felt only after the period of translations from Arabic\ninto Latin which began in Spain around the middle of the twelfth\ncentury. This process introduced many technical terms that came to\nhave considerable impact on philosophical and theological\ndiscussions. Also worth mentioning are the Liber sex\nprincipiorum, an anonymous work traditionally ascribed to Gilbert\nof Poitiers (1085/90–1154) that sought to expand Aristotle's\nbrief comments on the last six categories, and Peter Abelard\n(1079–1142), who discussed categories in his work (see Marenbon\n1997). \n\nAlthough commentaries on Aristotle's Categories written\nbefore 1200 tend to be expository, still they raise important\nphilosophical questions, such as whether the categories time\nand place are synonymous with when and\nwhere, or whether action and passion are\nreducible to motion. Even more important is the lively debate\nbetween realists and nominalists concerning whether categories are\nwords, concepts, or things (for Abelard's influence, see Marenbon\n1997, 108). The position they take on it determines the discipline in\nwhich they think the categories are studied and affect the degree of\nisomorphism they believe holds between language (words), thought\n(concepts), and reality (things). If Aristotle's Categories\nis a book about words, then categories are studied in grammar; if it\nis about concepts, they are studied in logic; and if it is about\nextra-mental things, they are studied in metaphysics. \n\nBy the early thirteenth century, an inclusive view, according to which\nAristotle's Categories is about words, concepts, and things,\nbecame standard. This view, shared by almost everyone up to Ockham\n(Pini, 2003, 11–18), had two important results. First, it lent\nsupport to the belief that categories are legitimately studied in\nthree disciplines: grammar, logic, and metaphysics, but especially in\nlogic and metaphysics. Second, it suggested a certain isomorphism\nbetween language (words), thought (concepts), and reality\n(things). The second point was supported by at least two passages in\nAristotle's writings. In On the Soul, Aristotle claims that\n“in the case of objects which involve no matter…\nspeculative knowledge and its object are identical” (430a\n3–4). And in the text of On Interpretation cited\nearlier (16a 4–8) a similar point is made.  Taken together,\nthese texts suggest that in some ways language (words), thought\n(concepts), and reality (things) are like each other in important\nways, a fact that explains their relations. \n\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth-century, works of Aristotle and\nhis Islamic commentators previously unknown in the Latin West became\navailable. Among these were four works on logic–Prior\nand Posterior Analytics, Topics, and Sophistical\nRefutations–that became known as the new\nlogic (logica nova) (Zupko 2003, 45). Their study did not\ndisplace the study of the older ones (the old logic, or logica\nvetus), but rather helped to intensify and expand it, and resulted\nin an increase in both the number and the complexity\nof the commentaries written about Categories. In addition,\nworks on metaphysics and natural philosophy, such as Aristotle's\nMetaphysics and Physics, as well as commentaries by\nIslamic authors on them, circulated widely. These works introduced\na new context and terminology in the discussion of\ncategories. \n\nFor example, an important factor in the new discussions was the\nnotion of science articulated by Aristotle in Posterior\nAnalytics. Generally, it was thought that scientific knowledge\ninvolves three things: a definition, a list of the properties in the\ntechnical Aristotelian sense of features not contained in the\ndefinition but consequent upon it, and a causal analysis. Faced with\nthis notion, scholastics explicitly asked whether categories are the\nsubject of scientific knowledge, and if so, whether the scientific\nknowledge in question is what Aristotle regarded as a\nknowledge of fact (scientia quia) or a knowledge of reasoned\nfact (scientia propter quid). Eventually they asked whether\ncategories could be defined and the kind of definition they could have;\nwhether they have properties and, if so, what\nproperties they have; and whether a causal analysis of them is possible\nand in what such an analysis would consist. These questions led them to\nquestion the discipline in which categories are studied–is it\ngrammar, logic, or metaphysics?–and often forced them to modify\ntheir views of both science and the categories (Pini 2003,\n189–90). \n\nA second important factor, found in Islamic commentators, was the\nintroduction of a distinction between first and second intentions, and\nthe understanding that the first are studied in metaphysics and other\nsciences that deal with the extra-mental world, whereas the second are\nstudied in logic (Pini 2003). There was\nconsiderable disagreement as to what these\n“intentions” are, but Aquinas conceived the first as\nconcepts about things in the world (e.g., “cat” is a\nconcept about cats) and the second as concepts about other concepts\n(e.g., “species” is a concept about such other concepts as\ncat and human). This new terminology led thirteenth century authors to\nask what the concepts of category and of particular categories (e.g.,\nsubstance or quality) are (first or second\nintentions?), and how the notions of first and second intentions ought\nto be understood. \n\nA third factor, the isomorphism between language, thought, and reality\ninherited from ancient discussions of Aristotle's view, prompted\nscholastic attempts to establish (some scholars use\n‘derive’ or even ‘deduce’) the exact number of\ncategories. Most popular among these was the effort to tie the\ncategories to different kinds of predication, but there were authors\nwho explored other possibilities, such as derivations based on the\nmodes of being.  Although there are early hints at an attempt based on\npredication in Simplicius' Commentary on Aristotle's\n“Categories,” it was not until the middle of the\nthirteenth century that commentators typically raised a separate\nquestion concerning the number of categories, an issue often referred\nto as sufficientia praedicamentorum. Albertus Magnus\n(ca. 1200–1280), Simon of Faversham (ca. 1260–1306), Peter\nof Auvergne (d. 1304), Radulphus Brito (ca. 1270–1320), and\nHenry of Ghent (ca. 1217–93), among others, attempted to\ndetermine the number of categories. The most famous and influential of\nthe authors who engaged in this exercise was Thomas Aquinas, who\nfollowed Albertus Magnus in trying to derive the categories from modes\nof predication. Simon of Faversham and Radulphus Brito, though,\nfollowed the tradition of deriving them from modes of being. Later\nthinkers, such as John Duns Scotus, doubted the possibility of such a\ndemonstration, and William of Ockham and John Buridan\n(ca. 1300–1361), among others, went even further, rejecting the\nview that there are ten categories of reality, let alone the\npossibility of demonstrating that there are ten categories. \n\nRobert is responsible for one of the first Latin commentaries on\nAristotle's Categories since Boethius' Commentary over six centuries\nearlier, even though his conception of logic is highly influenced by\nBoethius.  He developed a doctrine of a twofold consideration of\ncategories: categories are considered in one way in logic and they are\nconsidered in another way in metaphysics.  This twofold consideration\nbecomes important for subsequent philosophers, such as Aquinas and\nScotus, who maintain that in logic, categories have one set of\nproperties, whereas in metaphysics, they have another set of\nproperties.   \n\nKilwardby is also responsible for propagating, if not developing, the\ndistinction between material and formal logic, where the former treats\nof propositions and its parts (namely the categories), while the\nlatter treats the deductive structure of argumentation. (see Lewry,\n1978, and Pini, 2002). \n\nAlthough other commentaries on the categories were written shortly\nafter Kilwardby's Commentary (such as those written by Peter of Spain,\nRoger Bacon, Nicholas of Paris, and Johannes Pagus), the most\nimportant commentary was by Albertus Magnus. Albertus wrote\napproximately seventy works, not counting his sermons and letters. A\nlarge number of these were commentaries on the extant works of\nAristotle available to him at the time.  Nine of these works are\ndevoted to logic, and of these, six are commentaries on Aristotle's\nOrganon. However, within these commentaries, there is strong\ninclination towards a Neo–Platonic ontology which he barely\nmanages to keep apart from logic.   \n\nAn important element in Albert's Commentary is his derivation of the\nten categories, which was further developed and defended by his most\nfamous disciple, Thomas Aquinas.  Albert takes the modi praedicandi as\nhis starting point in his division of the categories.  The main\ndivision is between per se predicaments and those not per se, i.e.,\nbetween substance and accidents. The accidents are in turn divided\ninto absolute accidents and those with some sort of relation to\nothers. Absolute accidents are in turn divided on the basis of matter\n(which gives rise to quantity) or form (which brings about\nquality). Those accidents that have a relation to another are either\ncaused by the substance or by something extrinsic to the substance. As\nto the accidents caused by the substance, they are either caused by\nthe form (which accounts for action), the matter (which accounts for\npassion), or the entire composite (which accounts for relation). When\nthe relation is based on the parts to the whole, one has position. As\nto the accidents caused by something extrinsic, if the cause is due to\nproximity, there results the category of place. If the cause is due to\nmotion, the category of time results. Finally, the category of habit\nresults if the cause produces some addition to the substance. (For\nmore on Albert's derivation of the categories and how it influenced\nAquinas, see Bos 1998).  \n\nAlbert's Commentary is significant in that it is a close paraphrase of\nthe original Aristotelian text. (For its structure, see Ebbesen,\n1981). Although there is no translation of it into English, there is a\nnew critical edition of it.  \n\nUnlike many of his contemporaries, Aquinas did not\ncompose a commentary on Categories. Nevertheless, there are\nplenty of references to categories scattered throughout his writings.\nTwo texts are particularly important: one from his Commentary on\nAristotle's “Metaphysics,” the other from his\nCommentary on Aristotle's “Physics”\n(Met., V. lect. 9; nn. 889–91, Phys. III, lect.\n5, nn. 310–20). These texts are important for understanding two\naspects of Aquinas' view, the derivation of the categories from\nmodes of predication and the isomorphism between language, thought, and\nreality. \n\nThe derivation of the ten categories is most originally presented in\nthe Commentary on the “Metaphysics.” Aquinas\nbegins by dividing being into three modes: outside the mind\n(extra animam), in the mind (in mente), and\nas divided into act and potency (per potentiam et actum).\nBeing, considered in the first way (which is the one pertinent to the\ndiscussion here), is not divided as a genus (e.g., animal) is into\nspecies (e.g., human) by means of differences (differentiae,\ne.g., rational), because such differences need to be outside the\ngenus's essence (e.g., rationality is not included in animality),\nand nothing lies outside being. Being, as found outside the mind, is\ninstead divided into categories (praedicamenta) on the basis\nof how it is predicated (modi praedicandi). Predication occurs\nin three fundamental ways to indicate: (1) what a subject is (id\nquod est subiectum); (2) that something inheres in a\nsubject (inest subiecto); and (3) that something does not\ninhere in the subject and is beyond it but nonetheless affects it\n(sumatur ab eo quod est extra subiectum). These three modes of\npredication are in turn divided and subdivided to account for the ten\ncategories. \n\nIn the first kind of predication, the predicate expresses what a\nsubject is. For example, in ‘Socrates is a man,’\n‘man’ indicates that Socrates is a man. Of course,\none can ask further what man is, and so on until one reaches the\nhighest term, which is substance. The same is true, mutatis\nmutandis, of any other individual subject, for all subjects are in\nthe end some kind of primary substance, of which everything else is\npredicated. This kind of predication accounts for the first and most\nbasic category, substance [substantia]. \n\nIn the second kind of fundamental predication, the predicate\nindicates inherence in a subject. According to Aquinas, this kind of\npredication is initially divided into absolute (per se et\nabsolute) and relative (in respectu ad aliud). In\nabsolute predication the inherence comes from either the\nsubject's matter or form. When it comes from the matter, then the\npredicate falls into the second category, quantity\n[quantitas]. For example, in ‘Socrates is five and a\nhalf feet tall,’ ‘five and a half feet tall’ is taken\nfrom Socrates' matter. But when the inherence comes from the\nform, the predicate falls into the third category, quality\n[qualitas]. For example, in ‘Socrates is\nrational,’ ‘rational’ is taken from the form of\nSocrates, his humanity. If the predication is relative, however, then\nthe predicate falls into the fourth category, relation [ad\naliud]. For example, in ‘Socrates is the father of\nphilosophy,’ ‘father’ indicates the relation of\nSocrates to philosophy. \n\nIn the third kind of fundamental predication, the predicate\nindicates something that does not inhere in a subject and is beyond it,\nalthough it affects it in some manner. This kind of predication\naccounts for the remaining six categories. It is initially divided into\ntwo sorts: those that are completely extrinsic to the subject\n(omnino extra subiectum), and those that, while strictly\nspeaking are not in the subject, are nonetheless in some way in the\nsubject (secundum aliquid sit in subiecto). \n\nThe predications that are taken from something completely extrinsic\nto the subject are divided into those that do not in any way measure\nthe subject and those that do. In the former, predicates indicate\nsomething that affects the subject without measuring it. For example,\nin ‘Socrates is wearing clothes,’ ‘being\nclothed’ expresses that Socrates is affected but does not in any\nway measure him. These predicates belong to the fifth category,\nhabit [habitus] (a habit is a garment used by the\nreligious). Predications that in some way indicate a measuring of a\nsubject are divided into those that measure time (e.g., in\n‘Socrates came yesterday,’ ‘yesterday’ tells us\nthe pertinent time) and those that indicate place. In the first, the\npredicates fall into the sixth category, time\n[quando]. The second can in turn be divided into two\nkinds: predications in which the predicate signifies the parts of a\nsubject in relation to one another and those that do not. For example,\nin ‘Socrates is sitting,’ ‘sitting’ indicates\nSocrates' position. Likewise, in the example, ‘Socrates is\nin the market place,’ ‘market place’ identifies\nSocrates' location. The first kind of predication accounts for\nthe seventh category, position [situs], and the\nsecond for the eighth, location [ubi]. \n\nPredications indicating that something is not strictly speaking in\nthe subject but nonetheless in it in some way can be of two sorts. One\ninvolves a cause of an action. For example, in ‘Socrates is\nteaching,’ ‘Socrates’ refers to the cause of the\naction of teaching, and therefore accounts for the ninth category,\naction [agere]. The other involves being affected by\nan action. For example, in ‘Plato is being taught,’\n‘Plato’ refers to the recipient of the action of teaching,\nand therefore accounts for the tenth category, passion\n[pati]. \n\nFundamental to Aquinas' derivation of the categories is an isomorphism\nbetween language and reality. Only because language parallels reality\nin some way can Aquinas derive the ten categories of extra-mental\nthings from the ten different kinds of predication he accepts; we know\nthat there are ten different kinds of things based on the different\nways something is “said of” or “predicated of”\na subject. As John Wippel puts it, the “diverse modes of\npredication correspond to and reflect diverse ways in which being\nitself is realized, or what [Thomas] calls diverse modes of being\n(modi essendi). Moreover, this diversity in the order of\npredication follows from and depends upon diversity in the order of\nbeing” (Wippel 1987, 17). \n\nThis isomorphism holds not only between language and reality, but\nextends also to thought, which mediates between language and reality.\nAgain, as Wippel notes: “The mode or way in which words signify\ndoes not immediately follow upon modes of being of such things, but\nonly as mediated by the way in which such things are understood”\n(Wippel 1987, 17–18). Thus, one could say that things in the\nworld are isomorphic with concepts, and that concepts in turn are\nisomorphic with words insofar as our use of language follows the way we\nthink and this in turn follows the way the world is. \n\nFor many medieval Aristotelians, the isomorphism between language,\nthought, and reality does not apply only to the derivation of the ten\ncategories. A group of thirteenth-century thinkers commonly referred to\nas the modistae go well beyond Aquinas in\nthis respect. Although there is little consensus on exactly who these\nthinkers are, most accounts include Martin of Dacia (d. 1304), John of\nDacia (d. ca. 1280), Petrus Croccus (d. 1304), Michael of Marbais (fl.\nca. 1300), Radulphus Brito (ca. 1270–1320), and Thomas of Erfurt (fl.\nca. 1300). They are important in particular because of their views\nconcerning the strong isomorphism between language and reality. For\nmany of them this isomorphism is so profound that the boundaries\nbetween grammar, logic, and metaphysics are either non-existent or\nfuzzy. Thus, conclusions about the nature of things (reality) can be\nderived from grammatical (language) or logical (thought)\nconsiderations, just as Aquinas derives the ten ultimate\ncategories of reality from ten modes of predication. As Sten Ebbesen\ndescribes it: “The basic idea of modism is this: each constituent\nof reality (each res) has a number of ways or modes of being\n(modi essendi) which determine the number of ways in which it\ncan be correctly conceptualized; the ways in which it can be\nconceptualized (modi intelligendi) in turn determine in which\nway it can be signified” (Ebbesen 1998, 274). Christian Kloesel\nadds that by “discovering the logical structure and the causes of\nlanguage, a modista tried to explain the essential nature and\npurpose of human speech and the ways in which words have meaning. [For\nthe modistae thought] that the structure of language mirrors\nthe structure of reality and the operations of the human mind”\n(Kloesel 1981, 130). \n\nNot every late medieval author held that one can\ndemonstrate the number of categories, or that there is an isomorphism\nbetween language, thought, and reality. Some of them doubted\nthe possibility of proving that there are only ten\ncategories of reality, while some went so far as to reduce them to two\n(Ockham) or three (Buridan). \n\nAfter Aquinas' death in 1274, the number of commentaries written on\nAristotle's Categories multiplied exponentially, of which, as\nwe said before, almost 200 are still extant, although virtually all\nlack a critical edition and / or translation into English.  That said,\nthe most prominent commentators include Giles of Rome, (b. ca. 1245,\nd. 1316), Peter John Olivi (b. 1247, d. 1298), Dietrich of Freiberg\n(b. ca. 1250, d. 1320), Walter Burley (b. ca. 1275, d. ca. 1345),\nAntonius Andreae (b. ca.1280, d. 1320), Durand of St. Pourçain\n(b. ca., 1275, d. 1334), Hervaeus Natalis (b. ca.1260, d. 1323), Peter\nof Auvergne, John Buridan (b. 1295, d. 1358/61), Martin of Dacia\n(d. 1304), Simon of Faversham (b. 1260, d. 1306), and Radulphus Brito\n(b. 1270, d. 1320).   \n\nSeveral points are worth noting about these commentaries: First,\nMasters in the Arts faculty were formally forbidden from talking about\ntheological matters in their philosophical\ncommentaries. Notwithstanding this formal prohibition, the\ncommentaries on the categories were crucial for subsequent theological\ndiscussions, and the thinnest of pretexts would sometimes occasion a\ndigression into theological territory. Perhaps the most important\ntopic was the definition of an accident and whether or not every\naccident actually inhered in a substance or only had the potential so\nto inhere in it. How one answered this question was extremely\nsignificant in discussions of the Eucharist, in which the quantity of\nthe host, after consecration, no longer had a substance in which to\ninhere.   \n\nA second topic concerns the gradual shift away from exposition and\ntoward problem solving (‘questions’, as put by Andrews\n2001).  Even though the vast majority of these commentaries are not in\nprint and are difficult to obtain, the commentaries from the two most\ninfluential authors in the later Middle Ages survive and are\navailable. John Duns Scotus' Commentary was written around 1295, and\nWilliam of Ockham's around 1319. \n\nAccording to Scotus, neither the logician nor the metaphysician is\ncapable of showing that there are ten categories. There are in fact ten\ncategories, but any attempt to prove that there are only ten is faulty.\nIn his Questions on the “Metaphysics,” he puts it\nthus: “The various ways for showing the sufficiency of the\ncategories [so far] all seem to err in two ways” (Scotus 1997, V,\nq. 5–6, n. 73). The first error consists in the attempt to try to\nprove that there are ten and only ten categories, for such a proof does\njust the opposite. According to Scotus, purported demonstrations of ten\ncategories rely upon an initial division of predication into two basic\nclasses: predicates that indicate a “being in itself” and\npredicates that indicate a “being not in itself.” But this\nimplies that there are only two ultimate genera of being, not ten.\nIndeed, if one were to accept that the modes of predication and the\nmodes of being correspond to each other, as those who try to derive the\nnumber of categories from the modes of predication do, then one must\nconclude that there are only two categories––substance and\naccident, respectively––not ten. For the two most basic\nkinds of predication are either “being in a subject” or\n“not being in a subject.” \n\nThe second error, Scotus argues, is begging the question. Any\nattempt to demonstrate that there are only ten categories presupposes\nthe very thing to be demonstrated, namely, that there are ten and only\nten categories. “All these ways of dividing do not prove [the\nproposal], for one would have to prove that what is divided is thus\ndivided, and precisely in this way, and this to the issue at hand,\nnamely, that the dividends constitute these most general\n[categories]” (ibid., n. 75). \n\nEven though Scotus does not believe that it can be demonstrated that\nthere are only ten categories, he accepts that there are in fact only\nten categories of being (Pini 2005). Clearly, for him, reality (the\nactual number of categories) and what we know about them (what we can\ndemonstrate about them) do not correspond to each other. The\ncategories, as distinct kinds of things, are diverse from each other\nand this diversity entails that there is nothing from which we can\nestablish their number. As Pini notes, “[e]ven when Scotus comes\nto think that being is a univocal concept, he will always make clear\nthat there is no one real mode of being corresponding to that concept\nfrom which the different categories can be derived. Metaphysically\nspeaking, there are ten irreducible essences, even though they can be\nunderstood under a common concept” (Pini 2003, 13). Scotus'\nview of categories reveals that he does not accept the isomorphism\nbetween thought and reality common among medieval authors before him.\nFor him, however, the inability to deduce the number of categories is\nonly one of the ways in which signifying, understanding, and being are\nnot demonstrably isomorphic. \n\nA second difference between the order of being (reality) and the\norder of signifying (language) is revealed by the process known as\n“contraction.” In the conceptual order, a thing is\ncontracted from its genus to its species by a differentia that\ndistinguishes the species from other kinds within a genus. For example,\nthe genus “animal” is contracted to the species\n“man” by the differentia “rational,”\nthus setting human beings apart from other kinds of animals. In the\norder of reality, however, being is not contracted to any of the ten\ngenera, because ‘being’ does not have the same meaning when\napplied to every category. The ten highest genera have nothing in\ncommon with each other other than the fact that they are called\n‘being’ (Pini, 2005). However, insofar as the user of the\nterm is concerned, ‘being’ can be contracted to one of the\ncategories, for when one says ‘being in itself,’ one\nintends to signify substance, even though in the order of reality no\nsuch contraction occurs. This difference between reality and thought\nlies at the heart of Scotus' doubt concerning the possibility of\nderiving the number of categories. \n\nAnother example may help clarify the difference between the two\norders. Say that the word ‘John’ signifies at least two\npersons: John Scotus and John Eriugena. This means that when one uses\nthe word ‘John’ to refer to these two persons, it is used\nequivocally, for there is nothing common to both Scotus and Eriugena\nthat is signified by the term. Nevertheless, by adding a surname to\n‘John,’ say ‘Scotus,’\nthe name is contracted to ‘John Scotus’ as opposed to\n‘John Eriugena.’ Now, when a nature (e.g., man) is\ncontracted in the extra-mental order to Scotus or Eriugena, the\nnature, as it exists, is really contracted, but when ‘John’\nis contracted by the addition of ‘Scotus,’ the nature is\nnot contracted, only the utterance is. It is in this latter way, Scotus\nargues, that the expressions ‘being absolute’ or\n‘being per se’ contract ‘being’ to a\nsubstance in the conceptual order, for this contraction is based on the\nintent of the speaker, not on what is signified (i.e., not on the\nextra-mental order). \n\nWilliam of Ockham goes well beyond Scotus in his\nrejection of any kind of isomorphism between words, concepts, and\nthings. Ockham is well known for what is usually called\n“nominalism,” that is, the view that universals or natures\ndo not have any ontological status outside the mind. Moreover, in\ncontrast to many fourteenth-century authors who posit ten categories,\nOckham argues that our experience leads us to posit only two\nextra-mental categories: substance and quality. \n\nThe “little things” to which Ockham refers in this\npassage are what Scotus calls “common natures,” which\naccording to Scotus correspond to the different abstract predicates\nfound in each of the nine accidental categories. For Scotus, such terms\nas ‘squareness,’ ‘horseness,’ and\n‘fatherhood’ signify distinct and abstract existing\nentities, a view Ockham rejects. \n\nFollowing the standard medieval understanding of the opening lines of\nAristotle's On Interpretation, Ockham holds that written and\nvocal words are conventional signs of mental concepts, which are in\nturn natural signs of things. To a certain extent, he also admits that\nwritten and vocal words correspond to mental concepts, so that, just\nas there are ten kinds of predication, i.e., ten kinds of vocal\nutterances (the ten categories), there are also ten kinds of concepts\ncorresponding to them (see Panaccio 1999, 55).  However, Ockham argues\nthat our natural experience gives us no reason to think that the terms\nwe use for the categories signify ten extra-mental entities. Rather,\nexperience supports the view that only individual substances and the\naccident of quality exist extramentally. Ockham uses many semantic\ndevices to make his point (ibid., 71). For example, whereas Scotus\nmight say that “Socrates is a father because of\nfatherhood,” Ockham would rather say that “Socrates is a\nfather because he has generated a son” (Ockham 1991, V. q. 22,\n472; Klima 1999, 136). In this way, instead of positing an abstract\nentity, viz., “fatherhood,” to account for why Socrates is\na father, Ockham gives the activity of Socrates as an individual\nsubstance as the reason why Socrates is a father. However, in other\ncontexts and for specifically theological reasons, particularly when\nit comes to the cases of the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the\nEucharist, Ockham is willing to grant that relations are real. (see\nAdams 1987, 267, and Spade 1999, 104) \n\nOckham is equally clear concerning the discipline that studies\ncategories. Like Buridan, among others, he held that they are studied\nin grammar and logic, not in metaphysics. Aristotle's\nCategories is concerned with words that\nprimarily signify things, and only indirectly with\nthings. As Ockham puts it in his early Commentary on Aristotle's\ntext: \n\nThe ten categories, then, are studied both in grammar and logic,\nalbeit in different ways, but not in metaphysics. They are studied to\nthe extent that they signify things, but we must not suppose that\nthere is any one-to-one correspondence between words and concepts on\nthe one hand and things on the other. There is generally a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between words and concepts, though even here this is\nnot always true.  For example, in his Summa logicae, he\nclaims that participles and adjectives are distinct parts of speech\naccording to grammar, even though they are not distinct according to\nlogic (Ockham 1974, SL 3). Nevertheless, for Ockham, there\nare ten categories of words and concepts, but the extra-mental things\nthat are signified by them are either individual substances or\nindividual qualities. \n\nOckham employs a number of distinctions in the exposition of his\naccount. One of these is particularly important for subsequent authors.\nThis is the distinction between “category” taken as one of\nthe ten highest genera (e.g., substance, quantity, quality, etc.) and\n“category” taken as the set of coordinated\npredicates contained in each of these genera. In the\nformer sense, the term ‘category’ refers to each of the ten\nhighest genera, whereas in the latter sense, the term refers to any set\nof predicates ordered to one another. The most famous example of the\nlatter is Porphyry's tree, which starts out with\n“substance” at the top and includes in descending order\nsuch items as “corporeal,” “living,”\n“animal,” and “man.” In the Summa\nlogicae, Ockham presents the distinction as follows: \n\nOckham's view does not go unchallenged.\nWalter Burley (ca. 1275–1344/5), for example, develops his mature\ndoctrine of categories in opposition to Ockham in his Commentary on\nthe Old Logic (Conti 1990) and influences such later medieval\nrealists as Robert Arlyngton (fl. 1390), John Sharpe (1360-1415),\nand John Wyclif (1324-1384). \n\nFrom about 1350 to about 1450, scholastic thought was in retreat. At\nleast two factors seem to have contributed to this\nsituation: first, the epidemic known as the Black Death decimated the\nuniversities of medieval Europe, where scholastic thought had\nflourished in the thirteenth century; second, the Italian Renaissance\nbegan moving forward at high speed with its emphasis on the discovery\nof the ancients and its rejection of “the age in the\nmiddle.” However, after the middle of the fifteenth century,\nparticularly following the integration of the Iberian peninsula at the\nend of the century and the consolidation of the Spanish Empire, there\nwas a resurgence of scholasticism in the Iberian and Italian\npeninsulas. The Counter Reformation, a movement within the Catholic\nChurch intended to meet the challenge of the Reformation, also\ncontributed substantially to the rebirth of scholastic thought. Among\nthe great leaders of this movement were the Italian Thomas de Vio, also\nknown as Cajetan (1468–1534), and the Spaniard Francis Suárez.\nBoth had enormous influence on all subsequent\nscholastics and scholastically-inspired thought. Indeed,\nSuárez's Metaphysical Disputations (1597) became\nthe standard textbook of metaphysics in Europe and\nLatin America for one hundred and fifty years after its publication,\nwhich means that what he has to say about categories is important for\nunderstanding late scholastic category theory and the discussions of\nthe categories in Early Modern philosophy. Apart from questions of\noriginality, Suárez is historically important because he was a\nbridge for metaphysical thought between the Middle Ages and the Modern\nperiod. \n\nSuárez deals with categories in some detail in Disputation 39\nof the Metaphysical Disputations (henceforth DM), although he\nalso makes pertinent comments about them elsewhere (for example, in DE\nq. 75, a. 1, d. 47, s. 1, n. 4; 1861 vol. 21, p. 45a). In Metaphysical\nDisputation 39, he is primarily concerned with the division of\naccidents into nine highest genera, and the discussion of categories\nis incidental and indirect, rather than deliberate and\nexplicit. Nonetheless, it is clear that Suárez is concerned\nwith the ontological status of categories in this text.  Indeed, he\nexplicitly adopts a certain language in order to clarify and resolve\nthe issue. \n\nSeveral aspects of Suárez's doctrine reveal his overall\nposition. Three of these are particularly enlightening: First, the\ndistinction between supreme genera and categories; second, the\nrespective disciplines where these are studied; and third, the kind of\ndistinction that obtains between categories themselves. \n\nMedieval authors frequently use, interchangeably, the expressions\n‘supreme genus’ [generalissimum] and\n‘category’ (praedicamentum). The fact that these\nterms are interchanged indicates that those who use\nthem regard them as equivalent at least in certain contexts.\nSuárez is no exception; he often uses one term in place of the\nother. But there is a difference, for Suárez is aware of the\ndifference in terminology and explicitly distinguishes between the two\nexpressions. In a revealing passage, he tells us that “a category\nis nothing other than the appropriate disposition of genera\nand species from a supreme genus to individuals” (DM 39, 1; 1861,\n25:504b; our emphasis). This text makes clear that a category is not a\ngenus insofar as categories are dispositions of genera and\nspecies. Genera are not dispositions, whereas categories are. This\nmeans that, strictly speaking, categories cannot be supreme genera. In\nanother text Suárez is even more explicit: \n\nHere, Suárez repeats that categories are dispositions, but he\nadds another important term, ‘coordination.’ A category is\nnot properly speaking a genus, but rather the coordination or, we might\nsay, the arrangement of genera according to a pattern of essential\ninclusion which goes from the lowest to the highest (see Ockham 1991,\nV, q. 21, for a precedent to this language). We take it that\nSuárez means to say that categories such as quality and\nquantity, for example, are not themselves genera, but ways in\nwhich genera are related. Quality tells us how color\nis related to red and blue on the one hand (i.e.,\nlower species), and to texture and knowledge (i.e.,\nother genera) on the other. Red and blue are both\ncolors, but different from rough (a kind of texture) and\nknowledge of grammar (a kind of knowledge). But all these are\nqualities and different from three-inches wide, which is\ninstead a quantity. Quality and quantity, then, do\nnot function like genera, for a genus is signified by any predicate\nthat expresses what a subject is (e.g., in the sentence, ‘Man is\nan animal,’ ‘animal’ is the genus of man), and\ncategories do not function in this way. Following Porphyry's\nexample, the highest or supreme (generalissimum) genus is\nsubstance. \n\nThis brings us to the discipline under which categories are studied.\nSuárez tells us that the division into nine highest\ngenera–he is speaking of accidental genera, although what he\nsays also applies mutatis mutandis to substance–is\nproposed not only by metaphysicians, but also by logicians in treatises\non categories. Consequently, in one way it properly belongs to first\nphilosophy, that is, metaphysics, rather than logic. The reason is\nthat, whereas the metaphysician studies the ten supreme genera in order\nto explain their natures and essences, the logician does not have this\naim in mind. Logic is directed toward the operations of the mind,\nrather than toward natures and essences, and its purpose is to\nestablish rational ways of thinking. Logic deals with the concepts of\nthe mind insofar as these concepts can be arranged in accordance with\ncertain rules (DM 39, 1; 1861, 25:504b). \n\nIn another way, however, the categories are also studied in logic,\nnot in metaphysics, because they are mental concepts, and logic is\nconcerned with the proper analysis of concepts to determine their form\nand with the proper arrangement of concepts to determine their\nrelations. But this is not the whole story, for Suárez also\nspeaks of the ten supreme genera, and the study of these belongs to\nmetaphysics. Moreover, there is also another important point, which is\nmade explicit in the following text: \n\nThe logician treats of categories, which are ways in which concepts\nare appropriately arranged in the mind. However, because these concepts\nreflect the ways things are in reality, that is, the natures and\nessences of things in the world, the logician also deals, albeit only\nindirectly, with these natures and essences in order to be able to\nintroduce the proper order among them in the mind. The metaphysician,\non the other hand, deals directly with the ten supreme genera, not with\nways of arranging concepts in the mind, for the purpose of metaphysics\nis to determine the essences of things. \n\nSuárez makes an interesting aside in the discussion. He tells\nus that some authors mistakenly consider categories to be names, and\nonly names. This mistake arises because they look at categories only\nfrom the point of view of the logician, and the logician, qua logician,\nis not concerned with an ordering on the basis of the essences of\nthings but on the basis of the essences of names (DM 39, 1; 1861,\n25:505a). \n\nThe view that categories are concepts is supported further in his\ndiscussion of the distinction among categories. Suárez, like the\nother scholastics who precede him, holds that\ncategories are primarily diverse. This means that they share no common\nproperty or genus. Naturally, the question as to the source and nature\nof their diversity comes up, and Suárez discusses it in some\ndetail. For us, the important point is the nature of the distinction\namong categories themselves. Suárez rejects two opinions with\nrespect to this issue. According to one, a real distinction between the\nthings contained under a genus is necessary (DM 39, 2, 19; 1861, 25:\n515a). According to another opinion, the distinction between supreme\ngenera must be modal, actual, and ex natura rei, and must\nprecede in reality the operation of the mind (DM 39, 2, 20; 1861,\n25:515b). \n\nThe view Suárez proposes holds that categories are\ndistinguished according to “our way of conceiving, founded in\nreality. Some call this kind of distinction a distinction of reasoned\nreason, whereas others call it formal distinction” (DM 39, 2, 22;\n1861, 25:516b). The distinction of reasoned reason is, according to\nSuárez, a conceptual distinction. Conceptual distinctions come\nin two varieties: One is the distinction of reasoned reason and the\nother the distinction of reasoning reason. The second has no basis in\nreality but is purely a creation of the mind; it arises out of the\nintellect's activity of comparing, which makes possible its\ninfinite multiplication (DM 39, 2, 23; 1861, 25:517a). An example is\nthe distinction between Peter and himself in order to say that he is\nidentical to himself. The first, however, the distinction of reasoned\nreason, has a foundation in reality, even if the distinction itself is\nmerely conceptual. This is the kind of distinction that we make when we\nthink about God's attributes, for example. The foundation of this\ndistinction in the case of categories must be sufficient to allow\nrelations or modes of denomination of primary substance that are\nirreducible to one generic concept (DM 39, 2, 23; 1861, 25:517a). \n\nThis is obviously not enough to clarify the issue. The question\nremains: What is this foundation in reality which is the basis of the\ndenomination? It cannot be a category itself, for categories for\nSuárez are concepts and the product of conception and\nabstraction (DM 39, 2, 23; 1861, 25:517a). And it cannot be a reality\nwhich is exactly represented by the distinction, for then the\ndistinction would be real rather than conceptual. So what is it? \n\nThe point to consider is that a distinction of reasoned reason has\nsome basis in reality, even though the distinction itself is a concept\nin the mind, resulting from some comparison or of thinking about\nsomething. Now we can go back to categories and apply what we have\nlearned about the distinction of reasoned reason to them. Categories\nare ways in which humans conceive the world based on certain\ncomparisons that the mind carries out between other concepts, but these\nother concepts have reference in the world. An example would help, but\nthe one of God and His properties, which Suárez gives, is of no\ngreat use because of its uniqueness. Let us try to make up one that\nperhaps Suárez would accept. \n\nConsider the category quality. For Suárez,\nquality is a concept which the mind develops based on the\nmind's consideration of the relations between certain concepts,\nsuch as red, blue, grammatical, and so on,\non the one hand, and certain other concepts on the other, such as\nthree meters long, yesterday, woman, and so\non. In other words, quality tells us something about the first set of\nconcepts and their relations to other concepts. But the concepts\nbetween which relations are established have instances in reality,\noutside the mind, though not qua concepts. Red, as\nuniversal, is not to be found outside the mind. Nonetheless, there are\nred things in the world and each of them is an individual instance of\nthe universal red. This means that quality, in spite\nof being a concept based on the relation between concepts is\nnonetheless related, via those concepts, to the world outside the mind.\nAnd the same applies to the other concepts. So here we have the\nfoundation in reality of the category quality. \n\nEven the cursory discussion we have presented here should make a few\nthings clear about the development of category theory in the Middle\nAges. First, Aristotle's views had an extraordinary impact\nthroughout the period, for his Categories were ever-present in\nmedieval discussions of categories. Second, major changes occurred in\nthinking about this topic depending on the availability of various\nsources and the impact of different philosophical traditions. In the\nearly Middle Ages, Neoplatonic works such as the Categoriae\ndecem were very important, whereas later the influence of these\nworks faded and a more Aristotelian approach became dominant. Third, in\nspite of Aristotle's influence, medieval authors charted new\ncourses, which often went contrary to Aristotle's explicit views;\nwe need only think of the number of categories, for example. They also\nraised questions that were not explicitly posed by Aristotle, such as\nthe way that categories are established. Fourth, there was considerable\ndevelopment in the way in which the general topic of categories was\ndiscussed and the tools used to deal with it; late medieval logic\nplayed an increasingly important role in discussions, the terminology\nbecame more precise, the questions raised were made explicit, and the\ncontroversies were increasingly pointed. Finally, the relevance of\ncategories for metaphysical issues became crucial, so that it was in\nthe context of metaphysical works, such as Aquinas'\nCommentary on Aristotle's “Metaphysics” and\nSuárez's Metaphysical Disputations that we find\nsome of the richest discussions."}]
