It is important because\nit allows us to depend on others—for love, for advice, for help\nwith our plumbing, or what have you—especially when we know that\nno outside force compels them to give us these things. But trust also\ninvolves the risk that people we trust will not pull through for us,\nsince if there were some guarantee they would pull through, then we\nwould have no need to trust\n them.[1]\n Trust is therefore dangerous. What we risk while trusting is the loss\nof valuable things that we entrust to others, including our\nself-respect perhaps, which can be shattered by the betrayal of our\ntrust. \n\n\nBecause trust is risky, the question of when it is warranted is of\nparticular importance. In this context, “warranted” means\njustified or well-grounded meaning, respectively, that the trust is\nrational (e.g., it is based on good evidence) or that it successfully\ntargets a trustworthy person. If trust is warranted in these senses,\nthen the danger of it is either minimized as with justified trust or\neliminated altogether as with well-grounded trust. Leaving the danger\nof trust aside, one could also ask whether trust is warranted in the\nsense of being plausible. Trust may not be warranted in a particular\nsituation because it is simply not plausible; the conditions necessary\nfor it do not exist, as is the case when people feel only antagonism\ntoward one another. This entry on trust is framed as a response to the\ngeneral question of when trust is warranted, where\n“warranted” is broadly construed to include\n“justified”, “well-grounded” and\n“plausible”. \n\n\nA complete philosophical answer to the above question must explore the\nvarious philosophical dimensions of trust, including the conceptual\nnature of trust and trustworthiness, the epistemology of trust, the\nvalue of trust, and the kind of mental attitude trust is. To\nillustrate how each of these matters is relevant, note that trust is\nwarranted, that is, \n\nplausible, again, only if the conditions required for trust exist\n(e.g., some optimism about one another’s ability). Knowing what\nthese conditions are requires understanding the nature of trust. \n\nwell-grounded, only if the trustee (the one trusted) is\ntrustworthy, which makes the nature of trustworthiness important in\ndetermining when trust is warranted. \n\njustified, sometimes when the trustee is not in fact trustworthy,\nwhich suggests that the epistemology of trust is relevant. \n\njustified, often because some value will emerge from the trust or\nbecause it is valuable in and of itself. Hence, the value of trust is\nimportant. \n\nplausible, only when it is possible for one to develop trust,\ngiven one’s circumstances and the sort of mental attitude trust\nis. For instance, trust may not be the sort of attitude that one can\nwill oneself to have without any evidence of a person’s\ntrustworthiness. \n\nThis piece explores these different philosophical issues about trust.\nIt deals predominantly with interpersonal trust, which I take to be\nthe dominant paradigm of trust. Although some philosophers write about\ntrust that is not interpersonal, including trust in groups (Hawley\n2017), institutional trust (i.e., trust in institutions; see, e.g.,\nPotter 2002; Govier 1997; Townley and Garfield 2013), trust in\ngovernment (e.g., Hardin 2002; Budnik 2018) or science (e.g., Oreskes\n2019), self-trust (Govier 1993; Lehrer 1997; Foley 2001; McLeod 2002;\nGoering 2009; Jones 2012b; Potter 2013), and trust in robots (e.g.,\nCoeckelbergh 2012, Sullins 2020), most would agree that these forms of\n“trust” are coherent only if they share important features\nof (i.e., can be modeled on) interpersonal trust. I therefore assume\nthat the dominant paradigm is interpersonal. \n\n\nIn addition, while my focus is mainly on trust and trustworthiness, I\nalso discuss distrust (more so in this version of the entry than in\nprevious versions). Distrust has received surprisingly little\nattention from philosophers, although it has recently become a topic\nof serious concern for some of them, particularly those who are\ninterested in the politics of trust and distrust in societies marked\nby oppression and privilege. Relevant issues include when distrust is\nwarranted by people who experience oppression and how misplaced\ndistrust (i.e., in the oppressed) can be overcome by people who are\nprivileged. I delve into these matters and also summarize the few\ntheories that exist about the nature of distrust. \n\nTrust is an attitude that we have towards people whom we hope will be\ntrustworthy, where trustworthiness is a property not an attitude.\nTrust and trustworthiness are therefore distinct although, ideally,\nthose whom we trust will be trustworthy, and those who are trustworthy\nwill be trusted. For trust to be plausible in a relationship, the\nparties to the relationship must have attitudes toward one another\nthat permit trust. Moreover, for trust to be well-grounded, both\nparties must be trustworthy. (Note that here and\nthroughout—unless specified\notherwise—“trustworthiness” is understood in a thin\nsense according to which X is trustworthy for me just in case I\ncan trust X.) \nTrusting requires that we can, (1) be vulnerable to\nothers—vulnerable to betrayal in particular; (2) rely on others\nto be competent to do what we wish to trust them to do; and (3) rely\non them to be willing to do\n it.[2]\n Notice that the second two conditions refer to a connection between\ntrust and reliance. For most philosophers, trust is a kind of reliance\nbut is not mere reliance (Goldberg 2020). Rather, trust\ninvolves reliance “plus some extra factor” (Hawley 2014:\n5). Controversy surrounds this extra factor, which generally concerns\nwhy the trustor (i.e., the one trusting) would rely on the trustee to\nbe willing to do what they are trusted to do. \nTrustworthiness is likewise a kind of reliability, although it’s\nnot obvious what kind. Clear conditions for trustworthiness are that\nthe trustworthy person is competent and willing to do what they are\ntrusted to do. Yet this person may also have to be willing for certain\nreasons or as a result of having a certain kind of motive for acting\n(e.g., they care about the trustor). \nThis section explains these various conditions for trust and\ntrustworthiness and highlights the controversy that surrounds the\ncondition about motive and relatedly how trust differs from mere\nreliance. Included at the end is some discussion about the nature of\ndistrust. \nLet me begin with the idea that the trustor must accept some level of\nvulnerability or risk (Becker 1996; Baier 1986). Minimally, what this\nperson risks, or is vulnerable to, is the failure by the trustee to do\nwhat the trustor is depending on them to do. The trustor might try to\nreduce this risk by monitoring or imposing certain constraints on the\nbehavior of the trustee; but after a certain threshold perhaps, the\nmore monitoring and constraining they do, the less they trust this\nperson. Trust is relevant “before one can monitor the actions of\n… others” (Dasgupta 1988: 51) or when out of respect for\nothers one refuses to monitor them. One must be content with them\nhaving some discretionary power or freedom, and as a result, with\nbeing somewhat vulnerable to them (Baier 1986; Dasgupta 1988). \nOne might think that if one is relying while trusting—that is,\nif trust is a species of reliance—then accepted vulnerability\nwould not be essential for trust. Do we not rely on things only when\nwe believe they will actually happen? And if we believe that, then we\ndon’t perceive ourselves as being vulnerable. Many philosophers\nwriting on trust and reliance say otherwise. They endorse the view of\nRichard Holton, who writes, “When I rely on something happening\n… I [only] need to plan on it happening; I need to work around\nthe supposition that it will [happen]” (Holton 1994: 3). I need\nnot be certain of it happening, in other words, and I could even have\ndoubts that it will happen (Goldberg 2020). I could therefore accept\nthat I am vulnerable. I could do that while trusting if trust is a\nform of reliance. \nWhat does trusting make us vulnerable to, in particular? Annette Baier\nwrites that “trusting can be betrayed, or at least let down, and\nnot just disappointed” (1986: 235). In her view, disappointment\nis the appropriate response when one merely relied on someone to do\nsomething but did not trust them to do it. To elaborate, although\npeople who monitor and constrain others’ behavior may rely on\nthem, they do not trust them if their reliance can only be\ndisappointed rather than betrayed. One can rely on inanimate objects,\nsuch as alarm clocks, but when they break, one is not betrayed\nalthough one may be disappointed. This point reveals that reliance\nwithout the possibility of betrayal (or at least “let\ndown”) is not trust; people who rely on one another in a way\nthat makes this reaction impossible do not trust one another. \nBut does trust always involve the potential for betrayal?\n“Therapeutic trust” may be an exception (Nickel 2007: 318;\nand for further exceptions, see, e.g., Hinchman 2017). To illustrate\nthis type of trust, consider parents who  \ntrust their teenagers with the house or the family car, believing that\ntheir [children] may well abuse their trust, but hoping by such trust\nto elicit, in the fullness of time, more responsible and responsive\ntrustworthy behaviour. (McGeer 2008: 241, her emphasis; see also\nHorsburgh 1960 and Pettit 1995)  \nTherapeutic trust is not likely to be betrayed rather than merely be\ndisappointed. It is unusual in this respect (arguably) and in other\nrespects that will become evident later on in this entry. The rest of\nthis section deals with usual rather than unusual forms of trust and\ntrustworthiness. \nWithout relying on people to display some competence, we also\ncan’t trust them. We usually trust people to do certain things,\nsuch as look after our children, give us advice, or be honest with us,\nwhich we wouldn’t do that if we thought they lacked the relevant\nskills, including potentially moral skills of knowing what it means to\nbe honest or caring (Jones 1996: 7). Rarely do we trust people\ncompletely (i.e., A simply trusts B). Instead,\n“trust is generally a three-part relation: A trusts\nB to do X” (Hardin 2002: 9)—or\n“A trusts B with valued item C”\n(Baier 1986) or A trusts B in domain D\n(D’Cruz 2019; Jones\n 2019).[3]\n To have trust in a relationship, we do not need to assume that the\nother person will be competent in every way. Optimism about the\nperson’s competence in at least one area is essential,\nhowever. \nWhen we trust people, we rely on them not only to be competent to do\nwhat we trust them to do, but also to be willing or motivated to do\nit. We could talk about this matter either in terms of what the\ntrustor expects of the trustee or in terms of what the trustee\npossesses: that is, as a condition for trust or as a condition for\ntrustworthiness (and the same is true, of course, of the competence\ncondition). For simplicity’s sake and to focus some of this\nsection on trustworthiness rather than trust, I’ll refer to the\nmotivation of the trustee mostly as a condition for\ntrustworthiness. \nAlthough both the competence and motivational elements of\ntrustworthiness are crucial, the exact nature of the latter is\nunclear. For some philosophers, it matters only that the trustee is\nmotivated, where the central problem of trustworthiness in their view\nconcerns the probability that this motivation will exist or endure\n(see, e.g., Hardin 2002: 28; Gambetta 1988b). Jones calls these\n“risk-assessment views” about trust (1999: 68). According\nto them, we trust people whenever we perceive that the risk of relying\non them to act a certain way is low and so we rely on (i.e.,\n“trust”) them. They are trustworthy if they are willing,\nfor whatever reason, to do what they are trusted to do.\nRisk-assessment theories make no attempt to distinguish between trust\nand mere reliance and have been criticized for this reason (see, e.g.,\nJones 1999). \nBy contrast, other philosophers say that just being motivated to act\nin the relevant way is not sufficient for trustworthiness; according\nto them, the nature of the motivation matters, not just its existence\nor duration. It matters in particular, they say, for explaining the\ntrust-reliance distinction, which is something they aim to do. The\ncentral problem of trustworthiness for them is not simply whether but\nalso how the trustee is motivated to act. Will that person have the\nkind of motivation that makes trust appropriate? Katherine Hawley\nidentifies theories that respond to this question as\n“motives-based” theories (2014). \nTo complicate matters, there are “non-motives-based\ntheories”, which are also not risk-assessment theories (Hawley\n2014). They strive to distinguish between trust and mere reliance,\nthough not by associating a particular kind of motive with\ntrustworthiness. Since most philosophical debate about the nature of\ntrust and trustworthiness centers on theories that are either\nmotives-based or non-motives-based, let me expand on these\ncategories. \nPhilosophers who endorse this type of theory differ in terms of what\nkind of motive they associate with trustworthiness. For some, it is\nself-interest, while for others, it is goodwill or an explicitly moral\nmotive, such as moral integrity or\n virtue.[4] \nFor example, Russell Hardin defines trustworthiness in terms of\nself-interest in his “encapsulated interests” account\n(2002). He says that trustworthy people are motivated by their own\ninterest to maintain the relationship they have with the trustor,\nwhich in turn encourages them to encapsulate the interests of that\nperson in their own interests. In addition, trusting people is\nappropriate when we can reasonably expect them to encapsulate our\ninterests in their own, an expectation which is missing with mere\nreliance. \nHardin’s theory may be valuable in explaining many different\ntypes of trust relationships, including those between people who can\npredict little about one another’s motives beyond where their\nself-interest lies. Still, it is problematic. To see why, consider how\nit applies to a sexist employer who has an interest in maintaining\nrelationships with women employees, who treats them reasonably well as\na result, but whose interest stems from a desire to keep them around\nso that he can daydream about having sex with them. This interest\nconflicts with an interest the women have in not being objectified by\ntheir employer. At the same time, if they were not aware of his\ndaydreaming—say they are not—then he can ignore this\nparticular interest of theirs. He can encapsulate enough of their\nother interests in his own to keep his relationships with them going.\nAnd this would make him trustworthy on Hardin’s account. But is\nhe trustworthy? I assume the answer is “no” or that at\nleast the women themselves would say “no” if they knew the\nmain reason for their employment. The point is that being motivated by\na desire to maintain a relationship (the central motivation of a\ntrustworthy person on the encapsulated interests view) may not require\none to adopt all of the interests of the trustor that would actually\nmake one trustworthy to that person. In the end, the encapsulated\ninterests view might describe only reliability, not trustworthiness.\nThe sexist employer may reliably treat the women well, because of his\ninterest in daydreaming about them, but he is not trustworthy because\nof why he treats them well. \nA different type of theory is what Jones calls a\n“will-based” account, which finds trustworthiness only\nwhere the trustee is motivated by goodwill (Jones 1999: 68). This view\noriginates in the work of Annette Baier and is influential, even\noutside of moral philosophy (e.g., in bioethics and law, especially\nfiduciary law; see, e.g., Pellegrino and Thomasma 1993, O’Neill\n2002, and Fox-Decent 2005). According to it, a trustee who is\ntrustworthy will act out of goodwill toward the trustor, to what or to\nwhom the trustee is entrusted with, or both. While many readers might\nfind the goodwill view problematic—surely we can trust people\nwithout presuming their goodwill!—it is immune to a criticism\nthat applies to Hardin’s theory and also to risk-assessment\ntheories. The criticism is that they fail to require that the\ntrustworthy person care about (i.e., feel goodwill towards) the\ntrustor, or care about what the trustor cares about. As we have seen,\nsuch caring appears to be central to a complete account of\ntrustworthiness. \nThe particular reason why care may be central is that it allows us to\ngrasp how trust and reliance differ. Earlier I suggested that they\ndiffer because only trust can be betrayed (or at least let down). But\nwhy is that true? Why can trust be betrayed, while mere reliance can\nonly be disappointed? The answer Baier gives is that betrayal is the\nappropriate response to someone on whom one relied to act out of\ngoodwill, as opposed to ill will, selfishness, or habit bred out of\nindifference (1986: 234–5; see also Baier 1991). Those who say\nthat trusting could involve relying on people to act on a motive like\nill will or selfishness will have trouble distinguishing between trust\nand mere reliance. \nWhile useful in some respects, Baier’s will-based account is not\nperfect. Criticisms have been made that suggest goodwill is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient for trustworthiness. It is not necessary\nbecause we can trust other people without presuming that they have\ngoodwill (e.g., O’Neill 2002; Jones 2004), as we arguably do\nwhen we put our trust in strangers. \nAs well as being unnecessary, goodwill may not be sufficient for\ntrustworthiness, and that is true for three reasons. First, someone\ntrying to manipulate you—a “confidence trickster”\n(Baier 1986)—could “rely on your goodwill without trusting\nyou”, say, to give them money (Holton 1994: 65). You are not\ntrustworthy for them, despite your goodwill, because they are not\ntrusting you but rather are just trying to trick you. Second, basing\ntrustworthiness on goodwill alone cannot explain unwelcome trust. We\ndo not always welcome people’s trust, because trust can be\nburdensome or inappropriate. When that happens, we object not to their\noptimism about our goodwill, however (who would object to that?), but\nonly to the fact that they are counting on us. Third, we can expect\npeople to be reliably benevolent toward us without trusting them\n(Jones 1996: 10). We can think that their benevolence is not shaped by\nthe sorts of values that for us are essential to\n trustworthiness.[5] \nCriticisms about goodwill not being sufficient for trustworthiness\nhave prompted revisions to Baier’s theory and occasionally to\nthe development of new will-based theories. For example, in response\nto the first criticism—about the confidence trickster—Zac\nCogley argues that trust involves the belief not simply that the\ntrustee will display goodwill toward us but that this person owes us\ngoodwill (2012). Since the confidence trickster doesn’t believe\nthat their mark owes them goodwill, they don’t trust this\nperson, and neither is this person trustworthy for them. In response\nto the second criticism—the one about unwelcome\ntrust—Jones claims that optimism about the trustee’s\ngoodwill must be coupled with the expectation that the trustee will be\n“favorably moved by the thought that [we are] counting on\nher” (1996: 9). Jones does that in her early work on trust where\nshe endorses a will-based theory. Finally, in response to the third\nconcern about goodwill not being informed by the sorts of values that\nwould make people trustworthy for us, some maintain that trust\ninvolves an expectation about some shared values, norms, or interests\n(Lahno 2001, 2020; McLeod 2002, 2020; Mullin 2005; Smith 2008). (To be\nclear, this last expectation tends not to be combined with goodwill to\nyield a new will-based theory or theories.) \nOne final criticism of will-based accounts concerns how\n“goodwill” should be interpreted. In much of the\ndiscussion above, it is narrowly conceived so that it involves\nfriendly feeling or personal liking. Yet Jones urges us in her early\nwork on trust to understand goodwill so that it could be grounded in\nbenevolence, conscientiousness, or the like, or in friendly\nfeeling (1996: 7). Then in her later work, however, she worries that\nby defining goodwill so broadly we  \nturn it into a meaningless catchall that merely reports the presence\nof some positive motive, and one that may or may not even be directed\ntoward the truster. (2012a: 67)  \nJones abandons her own will-based theory upon rejecting both a narrow\nand a broad construal of goodwill. If her concerns about defining\ngoodwill are valid, then will-based theories are in serious\ntrouble. \nTo recapitulate about encapsulated-interest and will-based theories,\nthey claim that a trustworthy person is motivated by self-interest or\ngoodwill, respectively. Encapsulated-interest theories struggle to\nexplain how trustworthiness differs from mere reliability, while\nwill-based theories are faced with the criticism that goodwill is\nneither necessary nor sufficient for trustworthiness. Some\nphilosophers who say that goodwill is insufficient develop alternative\nwill-based theories. An example is Cogley’s theory according to\nwhich trust involves a normative expectation of goodwill (2012). \nThe field of motives-based theories is not exhausted by\nencapsulated-interest and will-based theories, however. Other\nmotives-based theories include those that describe the motive of\ntrustworthy people in terms of a moral commitment, moral obligation,\nor virtue. To expand, consider that one could make sense of the\ntrustworthiness of a stranger by presuming that the stranger is\nmotivated not by self-interest or goodwill, but by a commitment to\nstand by their moral values. In that case, I could trust a stranger to\nbe decent simply by presuming that she is committed to common decency.\nUltimately, what I am presuming about the stranger is moral integrity,\nwhich some say is the relevant motive for trust relations (those that\nare prototypical; see McLeod 2002). Others identify this motive\nsimilarly as moral obligation, and say it is ascribed to the trustee\nby the very act of trusting them (Nickel 2007; for a similar account,\nsee Cohen and Dienhart 2013). Though compelling in some respects, the\nworry about these theories is that they moralize trust inappropriately\nby demanding that the trustworthy person have a moral motive (see,\ne.g., Mullin 2005; Jones 2017). \nYet one might insist that it is appropriate to moralize trust or at\nleast moralize trustworthiness, which we tend to think of as a\nvirtuous character trait. Nancy Nyquist Potter refers to the trait as\n“full trustworthiness”, and distinguishes it from\n“specific trustworthiness”: trustworthiness that is\nspecific to certain relationships (and equivalent to the thin sense of\ntrustworthiness I use throughout; 2002: 25). To be fully trustworthy,\none must have a disposition to be trustworthy toward everyone,\naccording to Potter. Call this the “virtue” account. \nIt may sound odd to insist that trustworthiness is a virtue or, in\nother words, a moral disposition to be trustworthy (Potter 2002: 25;\nHardin 2002: 32). What disposition exactly is it meant to be? A\ndisposition normally to honor people’s trust? That would be\nstrange, since trust can be unwanted if the trust is immoral (e.g.,\nbeing trusted to hide a murder) or if it misinterprets the nature of\none’s relationship with the trustee (e.g., being trusted to be\nfriends with a mere acquaintance). Perhaps trustworthiness is instead\na disposition to respond to trust in appropriate ways, given\n“who one is in relation” to the trustor and given other\nvirtues that one possesses or ought to possess (e.g., justice,\ncompassion) (Potter 2002: 25). This is essentially Potter’s\nview. Modeling trustworthiness on an Aristotelian conception of\nvirtue, she defines a trustworthy person as “one who can be\ncounted on, as a matter of the sort of person he or she is, to take\ncare of those things that others entrust to one and (following the\nDoctrine of the Mean) whose ways of caring are neither excessive nor\ndeficient” (her emphasis;\n 16).[6]\n A similar account of trustworthiness as a virtue—an epistemic\none, specifically—can be found in the literature on testimony\n(see Frost-Arnold 2014; Daukas 2006, 2011). \nCriticism of the virtue account comes from Karen Jones (2012a). As she\nexplains, if being trustworthy were a virtue, then being untrustworthy\nwould be a vice, but that can’t be right because we can never be\nrequired to exhibit a vice, yet we can be required to be untrustworthy\n(84). An example occurs when we are counted on by two different people\nto do two incompatible things and being trustworthy to the one demands\nthat we are untrustworthy to the other (83). To defend her virtue\ntheory, Potter would have to insist that in such situations, we are\nrequired either to disappoint someone’s trust rather than be\nuntrustworthy, or to be untrustworthy in a specific not a full\n sense.[7] \nRather than cling to a virtue theory, however, why not just endorse\nthe thin conception of trustworthiness (i.e., “specific\ntrustworthiness”), according to which X is trustworthy\nfor me just in case I can trust X? Two things can be said.\nFirst, the thick conception—of trustworthiness as a\nvirtue—is not meant to displace the thin one. We can and do\nrefer to some people as trustworthy in the specific or thin sense and\nothers as trustworthy in the full or thick sense. Second, one could\nargue that the thick conception explains better than the thin one why\nfully trustworthy people are as dependable as they are. It is\ningrained in their character. They therefore must have an ongoing\ncommitment, and better still, their commitment must come from a source\nthat is compatible with trustworthiness (i.e., virtue as opposed to\nmere self-interest). \nAn account of trustworthiness that includes the idea that\ntrustworthiness is a virtue will seem ideal only if we think that the\ngenesis of the trustworthy person’s commitment matters. If we\nbelieve—like risk-assessment theorists—that it matters\nonly whether, not how, the trustor will be motivated to act, then we\ncould assume that ill will can do the job as well as a moral\ndisposition. Such controversy explains how and why motives-based and\nrisk-assessment theories diverge from one another. \nA final category are theories that base trustworthiness neither on the\nkind of motivation a trustworthy person has nor on the mere\nwillingness of this person to do what they are relied on to do. These\nare non-motives-based and also non-risk-assessment theories. The\nconditions that give rise to trustworthiness according to them reside\nultimately in the stance the trustor takes toward the trustee or in\nwhat the trustor believes they ought to be able to expect from this\nperson (so in normative expectations of them). These theories share\nwith motives-based theories the goal of describing how trust differs\nfrom mere reliance. \nAn example is Richard Holton’s theory of trust (1994). Holton\nargues that trust is unique because of the stance the trustor takes\ntoward the trustee: the “participant stance”, which\ninvolves treating the trustee as a person—someone who is\nresponsible for their actions—rather than simply as an object\n(see also Strawson 1962 [1974]). In the case of trust specifically,\nthe stance entails a readiness to feel betrayal (Holton 1994: 4).\nHolton’s claim is that this stance and this readiness are absent\nwhen we merely rely on someone or something. \nAlthough Holton’s theory has garnered positive attention (e.g.,\nby Hieronymi 2008; McGeer 2008), some find it dissatisfying. For\nexample, some argue that it does not obviously explain what would\njustify a reaction of betrayal, rather than mere disappointment, when\nsomeone fails to do what they are trusted to do (Jones 2004; Nickel\n2007). They could fail to do it just by accident, in which case\nfeelings of betrayal would be inappropriate (Jones 2004). Others\nassert, by contrast, that taking the participant stance toward someone\n \ndoes not always mean trusting that person: some interactions [of this\nsort] lie outside the realm of trust and distrust. (Hawley 2014: 7)\n \nTo use an example from Hawley, my partner could come to rely on me to\nmake him dinner every night in a way that involves him taking the\nparticipant stance toward me. But he needn’t trust me to make\nhim dinner and so needn’t feel betrayed if I do not. He might\nknow that I am loath for him to trust me in this regard: that is,\n“to make this a matter of trust” between us (Hawley 2014:\n7).  \nSome philosophers have expanded on Holton’s theory in a way that\nmay deflect some criticism of it. Margaret Urban Walker emphasizes\nthat in taking a participant stance, we hold people responsible (2006:\n79). We expect them to act not simply as we assume they will,\nbut as they should. We have, in other words, normative rather\nthan merely predictive expectations of them. Call this a\n“normative-expectation” theory, which again is an\nelaboration on the participant-stance theory. Endorsed by Walker and\nothers (e.g., Jones 2004 and 2012a; Frost-Arnold 2014), this view\nexplains the trust-reliance distinction in terms of the distinction\nbetween normative and predictive expectations. It also describes the\npotential for betrayal in terms of the failure to live up a normative\nexpectation.  \nWalker’s theory is non-motives-based because it doesn’t\nspecify that trustworthy people must have a certain kind of motive for\nacting. She says that trustworthiness is compatible with having many\ndifferent kinds of motives, including, among others, goodwill,\n“pride in one’s role”, “fear of penalties for\npoor performance”, and “an impersonal sense of\nobligation” (2006: 77). What accounts for whether someone is\ntrustworthy in her view is whether they act as they should, not\nwhether they are motivated in a certain way. (By contrast,\nCogley’s normative-expectation theory says that the trustworthy\nperson both will and ought to act with goodwill. His theory is\nmotives-based.) \nProminent in the literature is a kind of normative-expectation theory\ncalled a “trust- (or dependence-) responsive” theory (see,\ne.g., Faulkner and Simpson 2017: 8; Faulkner 2011, 2017; Jones 2012a,\n2017, 2019; McGeer and Petit 2017). According to this view, being\ntrustworthy involves being appropriately responsive to the reason you\nhave to do X—what you are being relied on (or\n“counted on”; Jones 2012a) to do—when it’s\nclear that someone is in fact relying on you. The reason you have to\ndo X exists simply because someone is counting on you; you\nshould do it, other things being equal, for this reason. Being\nappropriately responsive to it, moreover, just means that you find it\ncompelling (Jones 2012a: 70–71). The person trusting you expects\nyou to have this reaction; in other words, they have a normative\nexpectation that the “manifest fact of [their] reliance will\nweigh on you as a reason for choosing voluntarily to X”\n(McGeer and Pettit 2017: 16). This expectation is missing in cases of\nmere reliance. When I merely rely on you, I do not expect this fact\n(i.e., my reliance) to weigh on you as I do when I trust you. \nAlthough trust-responsiveness theories might seem motives-based, they\nare not. One might think that they require, in order to be\ntrustworthy, that you be motivated by the fact that you are being\ncounted on. Instead, they demand only that you be appropriately\nresponsive to the reason you have to do what you are being depended on\nto do. As Jones explains, you could be responsive in this way and act\nultimately out of goodwill, conscientiousness, love, duty, or the like\n(2012a: 66). The reaction I expect of you, as the trustor, is\ncompatible with you acting on different kinds of motives, although to\nbe clear, some motives are ruled out, including indifference and ill\nwill (Jones 2012a: 68). Being indifferent or hateful towards me means\nthat you are unlikely to view me counting on you as a reason to act.\nHence, if I knew you were indifferent or hateful, I would not expect\nyou to be trust responsive. \nTrust-responsiveness theories are less restrictive than motives-based\ntheories when it comes to defining what motives you need to be\ntrustworthy. At the same time, they are more restrictive when it comes\nto stating whether, in order to be trustworthy or trusted, you must be\naware that you are being counted on. You couldn’t be trust\nresponsive otherwise; and so, in trusting you, I must “make\nclear to you my assumption that you will prove reliable in doing\nX” (McGeer and Pettit 2017: 16). I do not have to do that\nif, in trusting you, I am relying on you instead to act with a motive\nlike goodwill. Baier herself allows that trust can exist where the\ntrustee is unaware of it (1986: 235; see also Hawley 2014; Lahno\n2020). For her, trust is ubiquitous (Jones 2017: 102), in part for\nthis reason; we trust people in a myriad of different ways every\nsingle day, often without them knowing it. If she’s right about\nthis fact, then trust-responsiveness theories are incomplete. \nThese theories are also vulnerable to objections raised against\nnormative-expectation theories, because they are again a type of\nnormative-expectation theory. One such concern comes from Hawley. In\nwriting about both trust and distrust, she states that  \nwe need a story about when trust, distrust or neither is objectively\nappropriate—what is the worldly situation to which (dis)trust]\nis an appropriate response? When is it appropriate to have\n(dis)trust-related normative expectations of someone? (2014: 11)  \nNormative-expectation theories tend not to provide an answer. And\ntrust-responsiveness theories suggest only that trust-related\nnormative expectations are appropriate when certain motives are absent\n(e.g., ill will), which may not to be enough. \nHawley responds to the above concern with her “commitment\naccount” of trust (2014, 2019). This theory states that in\ntrusting others, we believe they have a commitment to doing what we\nare trusting them to do (2014: 10), a fact which explains why we\nexpect them to act this way, and also why we fail to do so in cases\nlike that of my partner relying on me to make dinner; he knows I have\nno commitment to making his dinner (or anyone else’s)\nrepeatedly. For Hawley, the relevant commitments  \ncan be implicit or explicit, weighty or trivial, conferred by roles\nand external circumstances, default or acquired, welcome or unwelcome.\n(2014: 11)  \nThey also needn’t actually motivate the trustworthy person. Her\ntheory is non-motives-based because it states that to  \nbe trustworthy, in some specific respect, it is enough to behave in\naccordance with one’s commitment, regardless of motive. (2014:\n16)  \nSimilarly, to trust me to do something, it is enough to believe that I\n \nhave a commitment to do it, and that I will do it, without believing\nthat I will do it because of my commitment. (2014: 16; her\nemphasis) \nNotice that unlike trust-responsive theories, the commitment account\ndoes not require that the trustee be aware of the trust in order to be\ntrustworthy. This person simply needs to have a commitment and to act\naccordingly. They don’t even need to be committed to the\ntrustor, but rather could be committed to anyone and one could trust\nthem to follow through (Hawley 2014: 11). Thus, relying on a promise\nyour daughter’s friend makes to her to take her home\nfrom the party would count as an instance of trust (Hawley 2014: 11).\nIn this way, the commitment account is less restrictive than\ntrust-responsive theories are. In being non-motives-based,\nHawley’s theory is also less restrictive than any motives-based\ntheory. Trust could truly be ubiquitous if she’s correct about\nthe nature of it. \nLike the other theories considered here, however, the commitment\naccount is open to criticisms. One might ask whether Hawley gives a\nsatisfactory answer to the question that motivates her theory: when\ncan we reasonably have the normative expectations of someone that go\nalong with trusting them? Hawley’s answer is, when this person\nhas the appropriate commitment, where “commitment” is\nunderstood very broadly. Yet where the relevant commitment is implicit\nor unwelcome, it’s not clear that we can predict much about the\ntrustee’s behavior. In cases like these, the commitment theory\nmay have little to say about whether it is reasonable to trust. \nA further criticism comes from Andrew Kirton (forthcoming) who claims\nthat we sometimes trust people to act contrary to what they are\ncommitted to doing. His central example involves a navy veteran, an\nenlisted man, whose ship sunk at sea and who trusted those who rescued\nthem (navy men) to ignore a commitment they had to save the officers\nfirst, because the officers were relatively safe on lifeboats compared\nto the enlisted men who were struggling in the water. Instead the\nrescuers adhered to their military duty, and the enlisted man felt\nbetrayed by them for nearly letting him drown. If compelling, then\nthis example shows that trust and commitment can come apart and that\nHawley’s theory is\n incomplete.[8] \nThe struggle to find a complete or unified theory of trust has led\nsome philosophers to be pluralists about trust—that is, to say,\n“we must recognise plural forms of trust” (Simpson 2012:\n551) or accept that trust is not just one form of reliance, but many\nforms of it (see also Jacoby 2011; Scheman 2020; McLeod 2020). Readers\nmay be led to this conclusion from the rundown I’ve given of the\nmany different theories of trust in philosophy and the objections that\nhave been raised to them. Rather than go in the direction of\npluralism, however, most philosophers continue to debate what unifies\ntrust in a way that makes it different from mere reliance. They tend\nto believe that a unified and suitably developed motives-based theory\nor non-motives-based theory can explain this difference, although\nthere is little consensus about this theory is like. \nIn spite of there being little settled agreement in philosophy about\ntrust, there are thankfully things we can say for certain about it\nthat are relevant to deciding when it is warranted. The trustor must\nbe able to accept that by trusting, they are vulnerable, usually to\nbetrayal. Also, the trustee must be competent and willing to do what\nthe trustor expects of them and may have to be willing because of\ncertain attitudes they have. Last, in cases of paradigmatic trust at\nleast, the trustor must be able to rely on the trustee to exhibit this\ncompetence and willingness. \nAs suggested above, distrust has been somewhat of an afterthought for\nphilosophers (Hawley\n 2014),[9]\n although their attention to it has grown recently. As with trust and\ntrustworthiness, philosophers would agree that distrust has certain\nfeatures, although the few who have developed theories of distrust\ndisagree ultimately about the nature of it. \nThe following are features of distrust that are relatively\nuncontroversial (see D’Cruz 2020): \nGiven the relationship between trust and distrust and the similarities\nbetween them (e.g., one is “richer than [mere] reliance”\nand the other is “richer than mere nonreliance”; Hawley\n2014: 3), one would think that any theory of trust should be able to\nexplain distrust and vice versa. Hawley makes this point and\ncriticizes theories of trust for not being able to make sense of\ndistrust (2014: 6–9). For example, will-based accounts imply\nthat distrust must be nonreliance plus an expectation of ill will, yet\nthe latter is not required for distrust. I could distrust someone\nbecause he is careless, not because he harbors ill will toward me\n(Hawley 2014: 6). \nHawley defends her commitment account of trust, in part, because she\nbelieves it is immune to the above criticism. It says that distrust is\nnonreliance plus the belief that the person distrusted is committed to\ndoing what we will not rely on them to do. In spite of them being\ncommitted in this way (or so we believe), we do not rely on them\n(2014: 10). This account does not require that we impute any\nparticular motive or feeling to the one distrusted, like ill will. At\nthe same time, it tells us why distrust is not mere nonreliance and\nalso why it is normative; the suspicion of the one distrusted is that\nthey will fail to meet a commitment they have, which is bad.  \nSome have argued that Hawley’s theory of distrust is subject to\ncounterexamples (D’Cruz 2020; Tallant 2017). For example, Jason\nD’Cruz describes a financier who “buys insurance on credit\ndefaults, positioning himself to profit when borrowers default”\n(2020: 45). The financier believes that the borrowers have a\ncommitment not to default, and he does not rely on them to meet this\ncommitment. The conclusion that Hawley’s theory would have us\nreach is that he distrusts the borrowers, which doesn’t seem\nright. \nA different kind of theory of distrust can be found in the work of\nMeena Krishnamurthy (2015), who is interested specifically in the\nvalue that distrust has for political democracies, and for political\nminorities in particular (2015). She offers what she calls a\n“narrow normative” account of distrust that she derives\nfrom the political writings of Martin Luther King Jr. The account is\nnarrow because it serves a specific purpose: of explaining how\ndistrust can motivate people to resist tyranny. It is normative\nbecause it concerns what they ought to do (again, resist; 392). The\ntheory says that distrust is the confident belief that others will not\nact justly. It needn’t involve an expectation of ill will;\nKing’s own distrust of White moderates was not grounded in such\nan expectation (Krishnamurthy 2015: 394). To be distrusting, one\nsimply has to believe that others will not act justly, whether out of\nfear, ignorance, or what have you. \nD’Cruz complains that Krishnamurthy’s theory is too narrow\nbecause it requires a belief that the one distrusted will fail to\ndo something (i.e., act justly) (2020); but one can be\ndistrustful of someone—say a salesperson who comes to your door\n(Jones 1996)—without predicting that they will do anything wrong\nor threatening. D’Cruz does not explain, however, why\nKrishnamurthy needs to account for cases like these in her theory,\nwhich again is meant to serve a specific purpose. Is it important that\ndistrust can take a form other than “X distrusts Y\nto [do] Φ” for it to motivate political resistance\n(D’Cruz 2020: 45)? D’Cruz’s objection is sound only\nif the answer is “yes”. \nNevertheless, D’Cruz’s work is helpful in showing what a\ndescriptive account of distrust should look like—that is, an\naccount that unlike Krishnamurthy’s, tracks how we use the\nconcept in many different circumstances. He himself endorses a\nnormative-expectation theory, according to which distrust involves\n \na tendency to withdraw from reliance or vulnerability in contexts of\nnormative expectation, based on a construal of a person or persons as\nmalevolent, incompetent, or lacking integrity. (2019: 936)  \nD’Cruz has yet to develop this theory fully, but once he does\nso, it will almost certainly be a welcome addition to the scant\nliterature in philosophy on distrust. \nIn sum, among the relatively few philosophers who have written on\ndistrust, there is settled agreement about some of its features but\nnot about the nature of distrust in general. The agreed-upon features\ntell us something about when distrust is warranted (i.e., plausible).\nFor distrust in someone to be plausible, one cannot also trust that\nperson, and normally one will not be reliant on them either. Something\nelse must be true as well, however. For example, one must believe that\nthis person is committed to acting in a certain way but will not\nfollow through on this commitment. The “something else” is\ncrucial because distrust is not the negation of trust and neither is\nit mere nonreliance. \nPhilosophers have said comparatively little about what distrust is,\nbut a lot about how distrust tends to be influenced by negative social\nstereotypes that portray whole groups of people as untrustworthy\n(e.g., Potter 2020; Scheman 2020; D’Cruz 2019; M. Fricker 2007).\nTrusting attitudes are similar—who we trust can depend\nsignificantly on social stereotypes, positive ones—yet there is\nless discussion about this fact in the literature on trust. This issue\nconcerns the rationality (more precisely, the irrationality)\nof trust and distrust, which makes it relevant to the next section: on\nthe epistemology of trust.  \nWritings on this topic obviously bear on the issue of when trust is\nwarranted (i.e., justified). The central epistemological question\nabout trust is, “Ought I to trust or not?” That is, given\nthe way things seem to me, is it reasonable for me to trust? People\ntend to ask this sort of question only in situations where they\ncan’t take trustworthiness for granted—that is, where they\nare conscious of the fact that trusting could get them into trouble.\nExamples are situations similar to those in which they have been\nbetrayed in the past or unlike any they have ever been in before. The\nquestion, “Ought I to trust?” is therefore particularly\npertinent to a somewhat odd mix of people that includes victims of\ninfidelity, abuse, or the like, as well as immigrants and\ntravelers. \nThe question “Ought I to distrust?” has received\nrelatively little attention in philosophy despite it arguably being as\nimportant as the question of when to trust. People can get into\nserious trouble by distrusting when they ought to be trusting, not\njust by trusting when they ought to be distrusting. The harms of\nmisplaced distrust are both moral and epistemic and include\ndishonoring people, being out of harmony with them, and being deprived\nof knowledge via testimony (D’Cruz 2019; M. Fricker 2007).\nPresumably because they believe that the harms of misplaced trust are\ngreater (D’Cruz 2019), philosophers—and consequently I, in\nthis entry—focus more on the rationality of trusting, as opposed\nto distrusting. \nPhilosophical work relevant to the issue of how to trust well appears\neither under the general heading of the epistemology or rationality of\ntrust (e.g., Baker 1987; Webb 1992; Wanderer and Townsend 2013) or\nunder the specific heading of testimony—that is, of putting\none’s trust in the testimony of others. This section focuses on\nthe epistemology of trust generally rather than on trust in testimony\nspecifically. There is a large literature on testimony (see the entry\nin this encyclopedia) and on the related topic of epistemic injustice,\nboth of which I discuss only insofar as they overlap with the\nepistemology of trust. \nPhilosophers sometimes ask whether it could ever be rational to trust\nother people. This question arises for two reasons. First, it appears\nthat trust and rational reflection (e.g., on whether one should be\ntrusting) are in tension with one another. Since trust inherently\ninvolves risk, any attempt to eliminate that risk through rational\nreflection could eliminate one’s trust by turning one’s\nstance into mere reliance. Second, trust tends to give us blinkered\nvision: it makes us resistant to evidence that may contradict our\noptimism about the trustee (Baker 1987; Jones 1996 and 2019). For\nexample, if I trust my brother not to harm anyone, I will resist the\ntruth of any evidence to the contrary. Here, trust and rationality\nseem to come apart. \nEven if some of our trust could be rational, one might insist that not\nall of it could be rational for various reasons. First, if Baier is\nright that trust is ubiquitous (1986: 234), then we could not possibly\nsubject all of it to rational reflection. We certainly could not\nreflect on every bit of knowledge we’ve acquired through the\ntestimony of others, such as that the earth is round or Antarctica\nexists (Webb 1993; E. Fricker 1995; Coady 1992). Second, bioethicists\npoint out that some trust is unavoidable and occurs in the absence of\nrational reflection (e.g., trust in emergency room nurses and\nphysicians; see Zaner 1991). Lastly, some trust—namely the\ntherapeutic variety—purposefully leaps beyond any evidence of\ntrustworthiness in an effort to engender trustworthiness in the\ntrustee. Is this sort of trust rational? Perhaps not, given that there\nisn’t sufficient evidence for it. \nMany philosophers respond to the skepticism about the rationality of\ntrust by saying that rationality, when applied to trust, needs to be\nunderstood differently than it is in each of the skeptical points\nabove. There, “rationality” means something like this: it\nis rational to believe in something only if one has verified that it\nwill happen or done as much as possible to verify it. For example, it\nis rational for me to believe that my brother has not harmed anyone\nonly if the evidence points in that direction and I have discovered\nthat to be the case. As we’ve seen, problems exist with applying\nthis view of rationality to trust. Yet the rationality of trust\nneedn’t be understood according to it. This view is both\n“truth-directed” and “internalist”, but the\nrationality of trust could be “end-directed” or\n“externalist”. Alternatively, its rationality could be\ninternalist without requiring that we have done the evidence gathering\njust discussed. Let me expand on these possibilities, starting with\nthose that concern truth- or end-directed rationality. \nIn discussing the rationality of trust, some authors distinguish\nbetween these two types of rationality (also referred to as epistemic\nvs. strategic rationality; see, e.g., Baker 1987). One could say that\nwe are rational in trusting emergency room physicians, for example,\nnot necessarily because we have good reason to believe they are\ntrustworthy (thus, our rationality is not truth-directed), but because\nby trusting them, we can remain calm in a situation over which we have\nlittle control (our rationality is therefore end-directed). Similarly,\nit may be rational for me to trust my brother not because I have good\nevidence of his trustworthiness but rather because trusting him is\nessential to our having a loving\n relationship.[10] \nTrust can be rational, then, depending on whether one conceives of\nrationality as truth-directed or end-directed. Notice that it matters\nalso how one conceives of trust. For example, if trust is a belief in\nsomeone’s trustworthiness (see\n section 4),\n then whether the rationality of trust can be end-directed will depend\non whether the rationality of a belief can be end-directed. To put the\npoint more generally, how trust is rationally justified will depend on\nhow beliefs are rationally justified (Jones 1996). \nSome of the literature on trust and rationality concerns whether the\nrationality of trust can indeed be end-directed and also what could\nmake therapeutic trust and the like rational. Pamela Hieronymi argues\nthat the ends for which we trust cannot provide reasons for us to\ntrust in the first place (2008). Considerations about how useful or\nvaluable trust is do not bear on the truth of a trusting belief (i.e.,\na belief in someone’s trustworthiness). But Hieronymi claims\nthat trust, in a pure sense at least, always involves a trusting\nbelief. How then does she account for trust that is motivated by how\ntherapeutic (i.e., useful) the trust will be? She believes that trust\nof this sort is not pure or full-fledged trust. As she explains,\npeople can legitimately complain about not being trusted fully when\nthey are trusted in this way, which occurs when other people lack\nconfidence in them but trust them nonetheless (2008: 230; see also\nLahno 2001: 184–185). \nBy contrast, Victoria McGeer believes that trust is more substantial\nor pure when the available evidence does not support it (2008). She\ndescribes how trust of this sort—what she calls\n“substantial trust”—could be rational and does so\nwithout appealing to how important it might be or to the ends it might\nserve, but instead to whether the trustee will be\n trustworthy.[11]\n According to McGeer, what makes “substantial trust”\nrational is that it involves hope that the trustees will do what they\nare trusted to do, which “can have a galvanizing effect on how\n[they] see themselves, as trustors avowedly do, in the fullness of\ntheir potential” (2008: 252; see also McGeer and Pettit 2017).\nRather than complain (as Hieronymi would assume that trustees might)\nabout trustors being merely hopeful about their trustworthiness, they\ncould respond well to the trustors’ attitude toward them.\nMoreover, if it is likely that they will respond well—in other\nwords, they will be trust-responsive—then the trust in them must\nbe epistemically rational. That is particularly true if being\ntrustworthy involves being trust-responsive, as it does for McGeer\n(McGeer and Pettit 2017). \nMcGeer’s work suggests that all trust—even therapeutic\ntrust—can be rational in a truth-directed way. As we’ve\nseen, there is some dispute about whether trust can be rational in\njust an end-directed way. What matters here is whether trust is the\nsort of attitude whose rationality could be end-directed. \nPhilosophers who agree that trust can be rational (in a truth- or\nend-directed way or both) tend to disagree about the extent to which\nreasons that make it rational must be accessible to the trustor. Some\nsay that these reasons must be available to this person in order for\ntheir trust to be rational; in that case, the person is or could be\ninternally justified in trusting as they do. Others say that the\nreasons need not be internal but can instead be external to the\ntrustor and lie in what caused the trust, or, more specifically, in\nthe epistemic reliability of what caused it. The trustor also\nneedn’t have access to or be aware of the reliability of these\nreasons. The latter’s epistemology of trust is externalist,\nwhile the former’s is internalist. \nTo elaborate, some epistemologists write as though trust is only\nrational if the trustor themselves has rationally estimated the\nlikelihood that the trustee is trustworthy. For example, Russell\nHardin implies that if my trust in you is rational, then  \nI make a rough estimate of the truth of [the] claim … that you\nwill be trustworthy under certain conditions … and then I\ncorrect my estimate, or “update,” as I obtain new evidence\non you. (2002: 112)  \nOn this view, I must have reasons for my estimate or for my updates\n(Hardin 2002: 130), which could come from inductive generalizations I\nmake about my past experience, from my knowledge that social\nconstraints exist that will encourage your trustworthiness or what\nhave you. Such an internalist epistemology of trust is valuable\nbecause it coheres with the commonsense idea that one ought to have\ngood reasons for trusting people—reasons grounded in evidence\nthat they will be trustworthy—particularly when something\nimportant is at stake (E. Fricker 1995). One ought, in other words, to\nbe epistemically responsible in one’s trusting (see Frost-Arnold\n2020). \nSuch an epistemology is also open to criticisms, however. For example,\nit suggests that rational trust will always be partial rather than\ncomplete, given that the rational trustor is open to evidence that\ncontradicts their trust on this theory, while someone who trusts\ncompletely in someone else lacks such openness. The theory also\nimplies that the reasons for trusting well (i.e., in a justified way)\nare accessible to the trustor, at some point or another, which may be\nfalse. Some reasons for trust may be too “cunning” for\nthis to be the case. Here, I have in mind the reason for trusting\ndiscussed by Philip Pettit (1995): that trust signals to people they\nare being held in esteem, which is something they will want to\nmaintain; they will honor the trust because they are naturally\n“esteem-seeking”. Consciously having this as a reason for\ntrusting—of using people’s need for esteem to get what you\nwant from them—is incompatible with actually trusting (Wanderer\nand Townsend 2013: 9), if trust is motives-based and the required\nmotive is something other than self-interest. \nOthers say that reasons for trust are usually too numerous and varied\nto be open to the conscious consideration of the trustor (e.g., Baier\n1986). There can be very subtle reasons to trust or distrust\nsomeone—for example, reasons that have to do with body language,\nwith systematic yet veiled forms of oppression, or with a complicated\nhistory of trusting others about which one couldn’t easily\ngeneralize. Factors like these can influence trustors without them\nknowing it, sometimes making their trust irrational (e.g., because it\nis informed by oppressive biases), and other times making it\nrational. \nThe concern about there being complex reasons for trusting explain why\nsome philosophers defend externalist epistemologies of trust. Some do\nso explicitly (e.g., McLeod 2002). They argue for reliabilist theories\nthat make trust rationally justified if and only if it is formed and\nsustained by reliable processes (i.e., “processes that tend to\nproduce accurate representations of the world”, such as drawing\non expertise one has rather than simply guessing; Goldman 1992: 113;\nGoldman and Beddor 2015 [2016]). Others gesture towards externalism\n(Webb 1993; Baier 1986), as Baier does with what she calls “a\nmoral test for trust”. The test is that  \nknowledge of what the other party is relying on for the continuance of\nthe trust relationship would … itself destabilize the relation.\n(1986: 255)  \nThe other party might be relying on concealment of untrustworthiness\nor on a threat advantage, in which case the trust would probably fail\nthe test. Because Baier’s test focuses on the causal basis for\ntrust, or for what maintains the trust relation, it is externalist.\nAlso, because the trustor often cannot gather the information needed\nfor the test without ceasing to trust the other person (Baier 1986:\n260), the test cannot be internalist. \nAlthough an externalist theory of trust deals well with some of the\nworries one might have with an internalist theory, it has problems of\nits own. One of the most serious problems is the absence of any\nrequirement that trustors themselves have good reasons for trusting,\nespecially when their trust makes them seriously vulnerable. Again, it\nappears that common sense dictates the opposite: that sometimes as\ntrustors, we ought to be able to back up our decisions about when to\ntrust. The same is true about our distrust presumably: that sometimes\nwe ought to be able to defend it. Assuming externalists mean for their\nepistemology to apply to distrust and not just to trust, their theory\nviolates this bit of common sense as well. Externalism about distrust\nalso seems incompatible with a strategy that some philosophers\nrecommend for dealing with biased distrust. The strategy is to develop\nwhat they call “corrective trust” (e.g., Scheman 2020) or\n“humble trust” (D’Cruz 2019), which demands a humble\nskepticism toward distrust that aligns with oppressive stereotypes and\nefforts at correcting the influence of these stereotypes (see also M.\nFricker 2007). The concern about an externalist epistemology is that\nit does not encourage this sort of mental work, since it does not\nrequire that we reflect on our reasons for distrusting or\ntrusting. \nThere are alternatives to the kinds of internalist and externalist\ntheories I have discussed, especially within the literature on\n testimony.[12]\n For example, Paul Faulkner develops an “assurance theory”\nof testimony that interprets speaker trustworthiness in terms of\ntrust-responsiveness. Recall that on a trust-responsiveness theory of\ntrust, being trusted gives people the reason to be trustworthy that\nsomeone is counting on them. They are trustworthy if they are\nappropriately responsive to this reason, which, in the case of\noffering testimony, involves giving one’s assurance that one is\ntelling the truth (Adler 2006 [2017]). Faulkner uses the\ntrust-responsiveness account of trust, along with a view of trust as\nan affective attitude (see\n section 4),\n to show “how trust can ground reasonable testimonial\nuptake” (Faulkner and Simpson 2017: 6; Faulkner 2011 and 2020).\n \nHe proposes that A affectively trust S if and only if\nA depends on S Φ-ing, and expects his dependence on\nS to motivate S to Φ—for A’s\ndependence on S to be the reason for which S Φs\n…. As a result, affective trust is a bootstrapping attitude: I\ncan choose to trust someone affectively and my doing so creates the\nreasons which justify the attitude. (Faulkner and Simpson 2017: 6) \nMost likely, A (the trustor) is aware of the reasons that\njustify his trust or could be aware of them, making this theory an\ninternalist one. The reasons are also normative and non-evidentiary\n(Faulkner 2020); they concern what S ought to do because of\nA’s dependence, not what S will do based on\nevidence that A might gather about S. This view\ndoesn’t require that A have evidentiary reasons, and so\nit is importantly different than the internalist epistemology\ndiscussed above. It is also subject as a result, however, to the\ncriticisms made of externalist theories that they don’t require\nthe kind of scrutiny of our trusting attitudes that we tend to expect\nand that we ought to expect in societies where some people are\nstereotyped as more trusting than others. \nPresumably to avoid having to defend any particular epistemology of\ntrust, some philosophers provide just a list of common justifiers for\nit (i.e., “facts or states of affairs that determine the\njustification status of [trust]”; Goldman 1999: 274), which\nsomeone could take into account in deciding when to trust (Govier\n1998; Jones 1996). Included on the lists are such factors as the\nsocial role of the trustee, the domain in which the trust occurs, an\n“agent-specific” factor that concerns how good a trustor\nthe agent tends to be (Jones 1996: 21), and the social or political\nclimate in which the trust occurs. Philosophers have tended to\nemphasize this last factor as a justification condition for trust, and\nso let me elaborate on it briefly. \nWe have seen that although trust is paradigmatically a relation that\nholds between two individuals, forces larger than those individuals\ninevitably shape their trust and distrust in one another. Social or\npolitical climate contributes to how (un)trustworthy people tend to be\nand therefore to whether trust and distrust are justified. A climate\nof virtue, for example, is one in which trustworthiness tends to be\npervasive, assuming that virtues other than trustworthiness tend to\nenhance it (Baier\n 2004).[13]\n A climate of oppression is one in which untrustworthiness is\nprevalent, especially between people who are privileged and those who\nare oppressed (Baier 1986: 259; Potter 2002: 24; D’Cruz 2019).\n“Social trust”, as some call it, is low in these\ncircumstances (Govier 1997; Welch 2013). \nSocial or political climate has a significant influence on the default\nstance we ought to take toward people’s trustworthiness (see,\ne.g., Walker 2006). We need such a stance—assuming some rational\nreflection is required for trusting well—because we can’t\nalways stop to reflect carefully on when to trust. Some philosophers\nsay that the correct stance is trust and do so without referring to\nthe social or political climate; Tony Coady takes this sort of\nposition, for example, on our stance toward others’ testimony\n(Coady 1992). Others disagree that the correct stance could be so\nuniversal and claim instead that it is relative to climate, as well as\nto other factors such as domain (Jones 1999). \nOur trust or distrust may be prima facie justified if we have the\ncorrect default stance, although most philosophers assume that it\ncould only be fully justified (in a truth- or end-directed way) by\nreasons that are internal to us (evidentiary or non-evidentiary\nreasons) or by the causal processes that created the attitude in the\nfirst place. Whichever epistemology of trust we choose, it ought to be\nsensitive to the tension that exists between trusting somebody and\nrationally reflecting on the grounds for that trust. It would be odd,\nto say the least, if what made an attitude justified destroyed that\nvery attitude. At the same time, our epistemology ought to cohere as\nmuch as possible with common sense, which dictates that we should\ninspect rather than have pure faith in whatever makes us seriously\nvulnerable to other people, which trust can most definitely do. \nSomeone who asks, “When is trust warranted?” might be\ninterested in knowing what the point of trust is. In other words, what\nvalue does it have? Although the value it has for particular people\nwill depend on their circumstances, the value it could have for anyone\nwill depend on why trust is valuable, generally speaking. Trust can\nhave enormous instrumental value and may also have some intrinsic\nvalue. In discussing its instrumental value, I’ll refer to the\n“goods of trust”, which can benefit the trustor, the\ntrustee, or society in general. They are therefore social as well as\nindividual goods. What is more, they tend to accompany justified\ntrust, rather than any old\n trust.[14]\n Like the other sections of this entry, this one will focus\npredominantly on trust, although I will also mention recent work on\nthe value of distrust. \nConsider first the possibility that trust has intrinsic value. If\ntrust produced no goods independent of it, would there be any point in\ntrusting? One might say “yes”, on the grounds that trust\nis (or can be; O’Neil 2012: 311) a sign of respect for others.\n(Similarly, distrust is a sign of disrespect; D’Cruz 2019.) If\ntrue, this fact about trust would make it intrinsically worthwhile, at\nleast so long as the trust is justified. Presumably, if it was\nunjustified, then the respect would be misplaced and the intrinsic\nvalue would be lost. But I’m speculating here, since\nphilosophers have said comparatively little about trust being\nworthwhile in itself as opposed to worthwhile because of what it\nproduces, or because of what accompanies it. I’ll say no more\nabout the former and focus on the latter, in particular on the goods\nof trust. \nTurning first to the instrumental value of trust to the trustor, some\nargue that trusting vastly increases our opportunities for cooperating\nwith others and for benefiting from that cooperation, although of\ncourse we would only benefit if people we trusted cooperated as well\n(Gambetta 1988b; Hardin 2002; Dimock 2020). Trust enhances\ncooperation, while perhaps not being necessary for it (Cook et al.\n2005; Skyrms 2008). Because trust removes the incentive to check up on\nother people, it makes cooperation with trust less complicated than\ncooperation without it (Luhmann 1973/1975 [1979]). \nTrust can make cooperation possible, rather than simply easier, if\ntrust is essential to promising. Daniel Friedrich and Nicholas\nSouthwood defend what they call the “Trust View” of\npromissory obligation (2011), according to which “making a\npromise involves inviting another individual to trust one to do\nsomething” (2011: 277). If this view is correct, then\ncooperation through promising is impossible without trust. Cooperation\nof this sort will also not be fruitful unless the trust is\njustified. \nTrusting provides us with goods beyond those that come with\ncooperation, although again, for these goods to materialize, the trust\nmust be justified. Sometimes, trust involves little or no cooperation,\nso that the trustor is completely dependent on the trustee but the\nreverse is not true. Examples are the trust of young children in their\nparents and the trust of severely ill or disabled people in their care\nproviders. Trust is particularly important for these people because\nthey tend to be powerless to exercise their rights or to enforce any\nkind of contract. The trust they place in their care providers also\ncontributes to them being vulnerable, and so it is essential that they\ncan trust these people (i.e., that their trust is justified). The\ngoods at stake for them are all the goods involved in having a good or\ndecent life. \nAmong the specific goods that philosophers associate with trusting are\nmeaningful relationships or attachments (rather than simply\ncooperative relationships that further individual self-interests;\nHarding 2011, Kirton forthcoming) as well as knowledge and\n autonomy.[15]\n To expand, trust allows for the kinds of secure attachments that some\ndevelopmental psychologists (“attachment” theorists)\nbelieve are crucial to our well-being and to our ability to be\ntrusting of others (Bowlby 1969–1980; Ainsworth 1969; see Kirton\nforthcoming; Wonderly 2016). Particularly important here are\nparent-child relationships (McLeod et al. 2019). \nTrust is also crucial for knowledge, given that scientific knowledge\n(Hardwig 1991), moral knowledge (Jones 1999), and almost all knowledge\nin fact (Webb 1993) depends for its acquisition on trust in the\ntestimony of others. The basic argument for the need to trust what\nothers say is that no one person has the time, intellect, and\nexperience necessary to independently learn facts about the world that\nmany of us do know. Examples include the scientific fact that the\nearth is round, the moral fact that the oppression of people from\nsocial groups different from our own can be severe (Jones 1999), and\nthe mundane fact that we were born on such-in-such a day (Webb 1993:\n261). Of course, trusting the people who testify to these facts could\nonly generate knowledge if the trust was justified. If we were told\nour date of birth by people who were determined oddly to deceive us\nabout when we were born, then we would not know when we were born. \nAutonomy is another good that flows from trust insofar as people\nacquire or exercise autonomy only in social environments where they\ncan trust people (or institutions, etc.) to support their autonomy.\nFeminists in particular tend to conceive of autonomy this\nway—that is, as a relational property (Mackenzie and Stoljar\n2000). Many feminists emphasize that oppressive social environments\ncan inhibit autonomy, and some say explicitly that conditions\nnecessary for autonomy (e.g., adequate options, knowledge relevant to\none’s decisions) exist only with the help of people or\ninstitutions that are trustworthy (e.g., Oshana 2014; McLeod and Ryman\n2020). Justified trust in others to ensure that these conditions exist\nis essential for our autonomy, if autonomy is indeed\n relational.[16] \nGoods of trust that are instrumental to the well-being of the trustee\nalso do not materialize unless the trust is justified. Trust can\nimprove the self-respect and moral maturity of this person.\nParticularly if it involves reliance on a person’s moral\ncharacter, trust can engender self-respect in the trustee (i.e.,\nthrough them internalizing the respect signaled by that trust). Being\ntrusted can allow us to be more respectful not only toward ourselves\nbut also toward others, thus enhancing our moral maturity. The\nexplicit goal of therapeutic trust is precisely to bring about this\nend. I suggested above\n (section 2)\n that therapeutic trust can be justified in a truth-directed way over\ntime, provided that the trust has its intended effect of making the\ntrustee more trustworthy (McGeer 2008; Baker 1987: 12). Clearly, for\ntherapeutic trust to benefit the trustee, it would have to be\njustified in this way, meaning that the therapy would normally have to\nwork. \nFinally, there are social goods of trust that are linked with the\nindividual goods of cooperation and moral maturity. The former include\nthe practice of morality, the very existence of society perhaps, as\nwell as strong social networks. Morality itself is a cooperative\nactivity, which can only get off the ground if people can trust one\nanother to try, at least, to be moral. For this reason, among others,\nBaier claims that trust is “the very basis of morality”\n(2004: 180). It could also be the very basis of society, insofar as\ntrust in fellow citizens to honor social contracts makes those\ncontracts possible. \nA weaker claim is that trust makes society better or more livable.\nSome argue that trust is a form of “social capital”,\nmeaning roughly that it enables “people to work together for\ncommon purposes in groups and organizations” (Fukuyama 1995: 10;\nquoted in Hardin 2002: 83). As a result, “high-trust”\nsocieties have stronger economies and stronger social networks in\ngeneral than “low-trust” societies (Fukuyama 1995;\nInglehart 1999). Of course, this fact about high-trust societies could\nonly be true if, on the whole, the trust within them was\njustified—that is, if trustees tended not to\n“defect” and destroy chances for cooperating in the\nfuture. \nThe literature on distrust suggests that there are goods associated\nwith it as well. For example, there is the social good discussed by\nKrishnamurthy of “securing democracy by protecting political\nminorities from tyranny” (2015: 392). Distrust as she\nunderstands it (a confident belief that others will not act justly)\nplays this positive role when it is justified, which is roughly when\nthe threat of tyranny or unjust action is real. Distrust in general is\nvaluable when it is justified—for the distrustors at least, who\nprotect themselves from harm. By contrast, the people distrusted tend\nto experience negative effects on their reputation or self-respect\n(D’Cruz 2019). \nBoth trust and distrust are therefore valuable particularly when they\nare justified. The value of justified trust must be very high if\nwithout it, we can’t have morality or society and can’t be\nmorally mature, autonomous, knowledgeable, or invested with\nopportunities for collaborating with others. Justified distrust is\nalso essential, for members of minority groups especially. Conversely,\ntrust or distrust that is unjustified can be seriously problematic.\nUnjustified trust, for example, can leave us open to abuse, terror,\nand deception. \nTrust may not be warranted (i.e., plausible) because the agent has\nlost the ability to trust or simply cannot bring themselves to trust.\nPeople can lose trust in almost everyone or everything as a result of\ntrauma (Herman 1991). The trauma of rape, for example, can profoundly\nreduce one’s sense that the world is a safe place with caring\npeople in it (Brison 2002). By contrast, people can lose trust just in\nparticular people or institutions or have never trusted them before.\nThey or others might want them to become more trusting. But how could\nthat happen? How can trust be restored or generated? \nThe process of building trust is often slow and difficult (Uslaner\n1999; Baier 1986; Lahno 2020), and that is true, in part, because of\nthe kind of mental attitude trust is. Many argue that it is not the\nsort of attitude we can simply will ourselves to have when it seems\nthat the evidence in favour of it has vanished or never appeared to\nbegin with. At the same, it is possible to cultivate\n trust.[17]\n I focus here on these issues, including what kind of mental attitude\ntrust is (e.g., a belief or an emotion). I also discuss briefly what\nkind of mental attitude distrust is. Like trust, distrust is an\nattitude that people may wish to cultivate, particularly when they are\ntoo trusting. \nConsider first why one would think that trust can’t be willed.\nBaier questions whether people are able “to trust simply because\nof encouragement to trust” (1986: 244; my emphasis). She writes,\n \n“Trust me!” is for most of us an invitation which we\ncannot accept at will—either we do already trust the one who\nsays it, in which case it serves at best as reassurance, or it is\nproperly responded to with, “Why should and how can I, until I\nhave cause to?”. (my emphasis; 1986: 244)  \nBaier is not a voluntarist about trust, just as most people are not\nvoluntarists about belief. In other words, she thinks that we\ncan’t simply decide to trust for purely motivational rather than\nepistemic reasons (i.e., merely because we want to, rather than\nbecause we have reason to think that the other person is or could be\ntrustworthy; Mills 1998). That many people feel compelled to say,\n“I wish I could trust you”, suggests that Baier’s\nview is correct; wishing or wanting is not enough. But Holton\ninterprets Baier’s view differently. According to him,\nBaier’s point is that we can never decide to trust, not that we\ncan never decide to trust for motivational purposes (1994). This\ninterpretation ignores, however, the attention that Baier gives to\nsituations in which all we have is encouragement (trusting\n“simply because of encouragement”). The\n“cause” she refers to (“Why should and how can I,\nuntil I have cause to [trust]?”; 1986: 244) is an epistemic\ncause. Once we have one of those, we can presumably decide whether to\ntrust on the basis of\n it.[18]\n But we cannot decide to trust simply because we want to, according to\nBaier. \nIf trust resembles belief in being non-voluntary, then perhaps trust\nitself is a belief. Is that right? Many philosophers claim that it is\n(e.g., Hieronymi 2008; McMyler 2011; Keren 2014), while others\ndisagree (e.g., Jones 1996; Faulkner 2007; D’Cruz 2019). The\nformer contend that trust is a belief that the trustee is trustworthy,\nat least in the thin sense that the trustee will do what he is trusted\nto do (Keren 2020). Various reasons exist in favour of such\ntheories—doxastic ones (see Keren 2020)—including the\nreason that they make it impossible to trust a person while holding\nthe belief that this person is not trustworthy, even in the thin\nsense. Most of us accept this impossibility and would want any theory\nof trust to explain it. A doxastic account does so by saying that we\ncan’t believe a contradiction (not knowingly anyway; Keren 2020:\n113). \nThose who say that trust is not a belief claim that it is possible to\ntrust without believing the trustee is\n trustworthy.[19]\n Holton gives the nice example of trusting a friend to be sincere\nwithout believing that the friend will be sincere (1994: 75).\nArguably, if one already believed that to be the case, then one would\nhave no need to trust the friend. It is also possible to believe that\nsomeone is trustworthy without trusting that person, which suggests\nthat trust could not just be a belief in someone’s\ntrustworthiness (McLeod 2002: 85). I might think that a particular\nperson is trustworthy without trusting them because I have no cause to\ndo so. I might even distrust them despite believing that they are\ntrustworthy (Jones 1996, 2013). As Jones explains, distrust can be\nrecalcitrant in parting “company with belief”\n(D’Cruz 2019: 940; citing Jones 2013), a fact which makes\ntrouble for doxastic accounts not just of trust but of distrust as\nwell (e.g., Krishnamurthy 2015). The latter must explain how distrust\ncould be a belief that someone is untrustworthy that could exist\nalongside the belief that the person is trustworthy. \nAmong the alternatives to doxasticism are theories stating that trust\nis an emotion, a kind of stance (i.e., the participant stance; Holton\n1994), or a disposition (Kappel 2014; cited in Keren 2020). The most\ncommonly held alternative is the first one: that trust is an emotion.\nReasons in favour of this view include the fact that trust resembles\nan emotion in having characteristics that are unique to emotions, at\nleast according to an influential account of them (de Sousa 1987;\nCalhoun 1984; Rorty 1980; Lahno 2001, 2020). For example, emotions\nnarrow our perception to “fields of evidence” that lend\nsupport to the emotions themselves (Jones 1996: 11). When we are in\nthe grip of an emotion, we therefore tend to see facts that affirm its\nexistence and ignore those that negate it. To illustrate, if I am\nreally angry at my mother, then I tend to focus on things that justify\nmy anger while ignoring or refusing to see things that make it\nunjustified. I can only see those other things once my anger subsides.\nSimilarly with trust: if I genuinely trust my mother, my attention\nfalls on those aspects of her that justify my trust and is averted\nfrom evidence that suggests she is untrustworthy (Baker 1987). The\nsame sort of thing happens with distrust (Jones 2019). Jones refers to\nthis phenomenon as “affective looping”, which, in her\nwords, occurs when “a prior emotional state provides grounds for\nits own continuance” (2019: 956). She also insists that only\naffective-attitude accounts of trust and distrust can adequately\nexplain it (2019). \nThere may be a kind of doxastic theory, however, that can account for\nthe affective looping of trust, if not of distrust. Arnon Keren, whose\nwork focuses specifically on trust, defends what he calls an\n“impurely doxastic” theory. He describes trust as\nbelieving in someone’s trustworthiness and responding\nto reasons (“preemptive” ones) against taking precautions\nthat this person will not be trustworthy (Keren 2020, 2014). Reasons\nfor trust are themselves reasons of this sort, according to Keren;\nthey oppose actions like those of carefully monitoring the behavior of\nthe trustee or weighing the available evidence that this person is\ntrustworthy. The trustor’s response to these preemptive reasons\nwould explain why this person is resistant (or at least not attune) to\ncounter evidence to their trust (Keren 2014, 2020). \nDeciding in favour of an affective-attitude theory or a purely or\nimpurely doxastic one is important for understanding features of trust\nlike affective looping. Yet it may have little bearing on whether or\nhow trust can be cultivated. For, regardless of whether trust is a\nbelief or an emotion, presumably we can cultivate it by purposefully\nplacing ourselves in a position that allows us to focus on evidence of\npeople’s trustworthiness. The goal here could be\nself-improvement: that is, becoming more trusting, hopefully in a good\nway, so that we can reap the benefits of justified trust.\nAlternatively, we might be striving for the improvement of others:\nmaking them more trustworthy by trusting them therapeutically.\nAlternatively still, we could be engaging in “corrective\ntrust”. (See the above discussions of therapeutic and corrective\ntrust.) \nThis section has centered on how to develop trust and how to account\nfor facts about it such as the blinkered vision of the trustor. I have\nmentioned similar facts about distrust: those that concern what kind\nof mental attitude it is. Theorizing about whether trust and distrust\nare beliefs or emotions or what have you allows us to appreciate why\nthey have certain features and also how to build these attitudes. The\nprocess for building them, which may be similar regardless of whether\nthey are beliefs or emotions, will be relevant to people who\ndon’t trust enough or who trust too much. \nThis entry has examined an important practical question about trust:\n“When is trust warranted?” Also woven into the discussion\nhas been some consideration of when distrust is warranted. Centerstage\nhas been given to trust, however, because philosophers have debated it\nmuch more than distrust. \nDifferent answers to the question of when trust is warranted give rise\nto different philosophical puzzles. For example, in response, one\ncould appeal to the nature of trust and trustworthiness and consider\nwhether the conditions are ripe for them (e.g., for the proposed\ntrustor to rely on the trustee’s competence). But one would\nfirst have to settle the difficult issue of what trust and\ntrustworthiness are, and more specifically, how they differ from mere\nreliance and reliability, assuming there are these differences. \nAlternatively, in deciding whether trust is warranted, one could\nconsider whether it would be rationally justified or valuable. One\nwould consider these things simultaneously when rational justification\nis understood in an end-directed way, making it dependent on\ntrust’s instrumental value. With respect to rational\njustification alone, puzzles arise when trying to sort out whether\nreasons for trust must be internal to trustors or could be external to\nthem. In other words, is trust’s epistemology internalist or\nexternalist? Because good arguments exist on both sides, it’s\nnot clear how trust is rationally justified. Neither is it entirely\nclear what sort of value trust can have, given the nature of it. For\nexample, trust may or may not have intrinsic moral value depending on\nwhether it signals respect for others. \nLastly, one might focus on the fact that trust cannot be warranted\nwhen it is impossible, which is the case when the agent does not\nalready trust and cannot simply will themselves to do so. While trust\nis arguably not the sort of attitude that one can just will oneself to\nhave, trust can be cultivated. The exact manner or extent to which it\ncan be cultivated, however, may depend again on what sort of attitude\nit is. \nSince one can respond to the question, “When is trust\nwarranted?” by referring to each of the above dimensions of\ntrust, a complete philosophical answer to this question is complex.\nThe same is true about the question of when to distrust, because the\nsame dimensions (the epistemology of distrust, its value, etc.) are\nrelevant to it. Complete answers to these broad questions about trust\nand distrust would be philosophically exciting and also socially\nimportant. They would be exciting both because of their complexity and\nbecause they would draw on a number of different philosophical areas,\nincluding epistemology, philosophy of mind, and value theory. The\nanswers would be important because trust and distrust that are\nwarranted contribute to the foundation of a good society, where people\nthrive through healthy cooperation with others, become morally mature\nhuman beings, and are not subject to social ills like tyranny or\noppression."}]
